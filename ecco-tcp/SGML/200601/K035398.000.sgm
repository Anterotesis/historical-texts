<P>A DEFENCE OF Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter,</HI> A COMEDY Written by <HI>Sir</HI> GEORGE ETHERIDGE.</P>
<P>In which DEFENCE is &s;hewn, That Sir <HI>Fopling,</HI> that merry Knight, was rightly compos'd by the Knight his Father, to an&s;wer the Ends of <HI>Comedy</HI>; and that he has been barbarou&s;ly and &s;currilou&s;ly attack'd by the Knight his Brother, in the 65th <HI>Spectator.</HI></P>
<P>By which it appears, That the latter Knight knows nothing of the Nature of COMEDY.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Defence of the Comedy of Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter,</HI> not only contains &s;everal Remarks upon Co|medy in general; Remarks that are equally nece&s;&s;ary for the Writing it &s;ucce&s;sfully, and for the Judging of it &s;urely; but every Article of that De|fence, is a ju&s;t Cen&s;ure of a certain Comedy now in Rehear&s;al, if I can
<PB REF="3">
depend upon the Account which I have had of it, from &s;everal who have read it, or to whom it has been read. And that the Account which I have had of it is very just, I am apt to believe, not only from the Judgment and Sincerity of the Per&s;ons from whom I had it, but likewi&s;e from the &s;candalous Methods that are us'd, to give it a fal&s;e and a tran&s;itory Repu|tation.</P>
<P>I have formerly made Mention of Poetical Mountebanks. The Author of the Comedy now in Rehear&s;al, has all the Marks of an Empiric of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI>: His Play has trotted as far as <HI>Edin|burgh</HI> Northward, and as far as <HI>Wales</HI> We&s;tward, and has been read to more Per&s;ons than will be at the Repre&s;entation of it, or vouch&s;afe to read it, when it is publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
Another certain Sign that a Man is an Empiric, is, when he gives high <HI>Encomiums</HI> to him&s;elf, and his <HI>No|&s;trums,</HI> and pretends at the &s;ame Time, that tho&s;e <HI>Encomiums</HI> are given by others. Now, Adverti&s;ements have been &s;ent to the News-Papers to this Effect, That the Comedy now in Re|hear&s;al, is, in the Opinion of excellent Judges, the very be&s;t that ever came upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage. Now, no Body could &s;end that Adverti&s;ement but the Author, or one of his <HI>Zany's,</HI> by his own Contrivance, or, at lea&s;t, Connivance. No one could &s;end &s;uch an Adverti&s;ement, or give &s;uch a Judgment, but a Fool, or a Knave; a Knave, if he did it with a De&s;ign to impo&s;e on the World, and a Fool if he did it in the Sincerity of his Heart. For, to declare with Judgment, that a Play is the very best that ever came upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, requires va&s;t Con&s;ideration, profound Reflection, and a long, long Compari&s;on. And what Mortal
<PB REF="5">
is qualify'd to pa&s;s &s;uch a Judgment upon a &s;ingle momentary Reading? He who &s;ent tho&s;e Adverti&s;ements then, &s;ent them with a De&s;ign to impo&s;e upon the World, or is an arrant A&s;s. But 'tis highly improbable, that a Fool who knows nothing of the Matter, &s;hould give him&s;elf the Trouble to &s;end &s;uch an Adverti&s;ement; or that any one el&s;e &s;hould do it but the Author, or the Author's <HI>Zany's</HI> by his Subornation. For who&s;e Intere&s;t could it be but theirs, to endeavour to impo&s;e upon the World? But now, if it &s;hall appear by the follow|ing Treati&s;e, that the Author of the Dramatick Piece in Rehear&s;al, knows nothing of the Nature of True Comedy, then how fooli&s;hly arrogant are tho&s;e in&s;olent and impudent Adverti&s;ements? The&s;e very Ways of Proceeding, &s;uffici|ently declare the Author's Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own Incapacity; for a noble Genius will &s;corn &s;uch infamous Me|thods, and will re&s;olve to owe his Re|putation to his Merit, and not to tricking
<PB REF="6">
Artifice. The&s;e are &s;ome of the Methods which the pre&s;ent Managers of the <HI>Stage</HI> have us'd to ruine the <HI>Dramas,</HI> and with it all other Human Learning, which is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure dependant on it. For &s;ince Cabal and Trick, and the Favour and Intere&s;t of three or four &s;ordid Wretches, have been found nece&s;&s;ary for the obtaining Succe&s;s; every one who is duly qua|lify'd to write for the <HI>Stage,</HI> has either with a ju&s;t Di&s;dain refus'd it, or has undertaken it with extream Reluctancy. The <HI>Drama</HI> therefore is like to be lo&s;t, and all the Arts dependent on it; therefore every one who is concern'd for the Honour of his Country, ought to do his utmo&s;t Endeavour to prevent a Ca|lamity which will be &s;o great a Di&s;|grace to it: And all who are concern'd for the Honour of the <HI>KING,</HI> ought to reflect with Indignation, that by the Malice, and the ba&s;e&s;t <HI>Breach of Tru&s;t</HI> of Per&s;ons whom <HI>His MAJESTY</HI> has appointed to encourage Literature, all

<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_A Certain Knight, who has employ'd &s;o much of his empty Labour in extol|ling the weak Perfor|mances of &s;ome living Authors, has &s;curriou&s;ly and inhumanly in the 65th Spectator, attack'd one of the mo&s;t entertaining Comedies of the la&s;t Age, written by a mo&s;t ingenious Gentleman, who perfect|ly under&s;tood the World, the Court,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
and the Town, and who&s;e Reputation has now for near thirty Years together, &s;urviv'd his Per&s;on, and will, in all Pro|bability, &s;urvive it as long as Comedy &s;hall be in vogue; by which Proceed|ing, this worthy Knight has incurr'd the double Cen&s;ure, that <HI>Olivia</HI> in the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">'d Dealer has ca&s;t upon a certain Coxcomb <Q>Who rather, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> then not flatter, will flatter the Poets of the Age, whom none will flatter; and rather then not rail, will rail at the Dead, at whom none be&s;ides will rail.</Q></P>
<P>If other Authors have had the Mis|fortune, to incurr the Cen&s;ure of ill|nature with unthinking deluded People, for no other &s;o much as pretended Rea|&s;on, than becau&s;e to improve a noble Art, they have expos'd the Errors of popular Writers, who ow'd their Suc|ce&s;s, to the infamous Method of &s;ecur|ing an ignorant or a corrupt Cabal; when tho&s;e Writers were not only liv|ing, but in full Pro&s;perity, and at full Liberty to an&s;wer for them&s;elves; what Appellation mu&s;t he de&s;erve, who has ba&s;ely and &s;currilou&s;ly attack'd the Re|putation of a Favourite of the comick Mu&s;e, and of the Darling of the Graces, after Death has for &s;o many Years depriv'd
<PB N="3" REF="10">
him of the Means of an&s;wering for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What the Knight fal&s;ely and impu|dently &s;ays of the Comedy, may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of the Critici&s;m, and of the whole 65th Spectator, that 'tis a perfect Contradiction to good Manners and good Sen&s;e. He allows this Comedy, he &s;ays, to be in Nature, but 'tis Nature in its utmo&s;t Corruption and Dege|neracy.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e this were true, I would fain know where he learnt, that Nature in its utmo&s;t Corruption and Degeneracy, is not the proper Subject of Comedy? Is not this a merry Per&s;on, who, after he has been writing what he calls Comedy for twenty Years together, &s;hews plain|ly to all the World that he knows no|thing of the Nature of true Comedy, and that he has not learnt the very fir&s;t Rudiments of an Art which he pretends to teach? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Ridicule in Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter,</HI> is an Imitation of corrupt and degenerate Nature, but not the mo&s;t corrupt and the mo&s;t degene|rate; for there is neither Adultery, Murder, nor Sodomy in it. But can any Thing but corrupt and degenerate
<PB N="4" REF="11">
Nature be the proper Subject of Ridi|cule? And can any Thing but Ridicule be the proper Subject of Comedy? Has not <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> told us in the Fifth Chapter of his Poeticks, that Comedy is an Imi|tation of the very wor&s;t of Men? Not the wor&s;t, &s;ays He, in every Sort of Vice, but the wor&s;t in the Ridicule. And has not <HI>Horace,</HI> in the Fourth Sa|tyr of his Fir&s;t Book, reminded us, that the old <HI>Athenian</HI> Comick Poets made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring all Sorts of Vil|lains upon the Stage, Adulterers, Cheats, Theives, Murderers? But then they always took Care, &s;ays a modern Cri|tick, that tho&s;e &s;everal Villanies &s;hould be envelop'd in the Ridicule, which a|lone, &s;ays he, could make them the proper Subjects of Comedy. If this facetious Knight had formerly liv'd at <HI>Lacedemon</HI> with the &s;ame wrong turn'd Noddle that he has now among us, would he not, do you think, have in|veighed again&s;t that People, for &s;hewing their drunken Slaves to their Children? Would he not have repre&s;ented it as a Thing of mo&s;t pernicious Example? What the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> did by Drunk|enne&s;s, the Comick Poet does by that and all other Vices. He expo&s;es them to the View of his Fellow Subjects, for no
<PB N="5" REF="12">
other Rea&s;on, than to render them ridi|culous and contemptible.</P>
<P>But the Critici&s;m of the Knight in the fore&s;aid Spectator, is as contrary to good Manners, as it is to good Sen&s;e. What <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and his Interpreters &s;ay of Tra|gedy, that 'tis infallibly good, when it plea&s;es both the Judges and the People, is certainly as true of Comedy; for the Judges are equally qualify'd to judge of both, and the People may be &s;up|pos'd to be better Judges of Comedy then they are of Tragedy, becau&s;e Co|medy is nothing but a Picture of com|mon Life, and a Repre&s;entation of their own Humours and Manners. Now this Comedy of Sir <HI>Fopling Flutter,</HI> has not been only well receiv'd, and believ'd by the People of <HI>England</HI> to be a mo&s;t agreeable Comedy for about Half a Century, but the Judges have been &s;till more pleas'd with it then the People. They have ju&s;tly believ'd (I &s;peak of the Judges) that the Characters, and e&s;pecially the principal Characters, are admirably drawn, to an&s;wer the two Ends of Comedy, Plea&s;ure, and In|&s;truction; and that the Dialogue is the mo&s;t charming that has been writ by the Moderns: That with Purity and
<PB N="6" REF="13">
Simplicity, it has Art and Elegance; and with Force and Vivacity, the ut|mo&s;t Grace and Delicacy. This I know very well, was the Opinion of the mo&s;t eminent Writers, and of the be&s;t Judges contemporary with the Author; and of the whole Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, a Court the mo&s;t polite that ever <HI>England</HI> &s;aw.</P>
<P>Now, after this Comedy has pa&s;s'd with the whole People of <HI>England,</HI> the knowing as well as the Ignorant, for a mo&s;t entertaining and mo&s;t in&s;tructive Comedy, for fifty Years together, after that long Time comes a Two-Penny Author, who has given a thou&s;and Proofs thro' the Cour&s;e of his Rhap&s;o|dies, that he under&s;tands not a Tittle of all this Matter; this Author comes and impudently declares, that this whole celebrated Piece, that has for half a Century, been admir'd by the whole People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is a perfect Con|tradiction to good Sen&s;e, to good Man|ners, and to common Hone&s;ty. <HI>O Tem|pora! O Mores!</HI></P>
<P>The Knight certainly wrote the fore|mention'd Spectator, tho' it as been writ the&s;e ten Years, on Purpo&s;e to
<PB N="7" REF="14">
make Way for his fine Gentleman, and therefore he endeavours to prove, that Sir <HI>Fopling</HI> is not that genteel Comedy, which the World allows it to be. And then, according to his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, whenever he pretends to critici&s;e, he does, by &s;huffling and cutting and con|founding Notions, impo&s;e upon his un|wary Reader; for either Sir <HI>George Ethe|ridge,</HI> did de&s;ign to make this a genteel Comedy, or he did not. If he did not de&s;ign it, what is it to the Purpo&s;e, whe|ther 'tis a genteel Comedy or not? Pro|vided that 'tis a good one: For I hope, a Comedy may be a good one, and yet not a genteel one. The <HI>Alchimi&s;t</HI> is an admirable Comedy, and yet it is not a genteel one. We may &s;ay the &s;ame of <HI>The Fox, and the &s;ilent Woman,</HI> and of a great many more. But if Sir <HI>George</HI> did de&s;ign to make it a genteel one, he was oblig'd to adapt it to that No|tion of Gentility, which he knew very well, that the World at that Time had, and we &s;ee he &s;ucceeded accordingly. For it has pa&s;s'd for a very genteel Comedy, for fifty Years together. Could it be expected that the admirable Au|thor, &s;hould accommodate him&s;elf, to the wrong headed Notions of a would be Critick, who was to appear fifty
<PB N="8" REF="15">
Years after the fir&s;t Acting of his Play: A Gritick, who writes Critici&s;m as Men commit Trea&s;on or Murder, by the In|&s;tigation of the Devil him&s;elf, when|ever the old Gentleman owes the Knight a Shame.</P>
<P>To prove that this Comedy is not a genteel one, he endeavours to prove that one of the principal Characters, is not a fine Gentleman. I appeal to every impartial Man, if when he &s;ays, that a Man or a Woman are genteel, he means any Thing more, than that they are agreeble in their Air, graceful in in their Motions, and polite in their Conver&s;ation. But when he endeavours to prove, that <HI>Dorimont</HI> is not a fine Gentleman, he &s;ays no more to the Purpo&s;e, then he &s;aid before, when he affirm'd that the Comedy is not a genteel Comedy; for either the Author de&s;ign'd in <HI>Dorimont</HI> a fine Gentleman, or he did not. If he did not, the Character is ne'er the le&s;s excellent on that Account, becau&s;e <HI>Dorimnot</HI> is an admirable Picture of a Courtier in the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. But if <HI>Dorimont</HI> was de&s;ign'd for a fine Gentleman by the Author, he was oblig'd to accom|modate him&s;elf to that Notion of a
<PB N="9" REF="16">
fine Gentleman, which the Court And the Town both had at the Time of the writing of this Comedy. 'Tis rea&s;ona|ble to believe, that he did &s;o, and we &s;ee that he &s;ucceeded accordingly. For <HI>Dorimont</HI> not only pa&s;s'd for a fine Gen|tleman with the Court of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, but he has pa&s;s'd for &s;uch with all the World, for Fifty Years to|gether. And what indeed can any one mean, when he &s;peaks of a fine Gentle|man, but one who is qualify'd in Con|ver&s;ation, to plea&s;e the be&s;t Company of either Sex.</P>
<P>But the Knight will be &s;atisfy'd with no Notion of a fine Gentleman but his own. A fine Gentleman, &s;ays he, is one who is hone&s;t in his Actions, and refin'd in his Language. If this be a ju&s;t De&s;cription of a fine Gentleman, I will make bold to draw two Con&s;e|quences from it. The fir&s;t is, That a Pedant is often a fine Gentleman. For I have known &s;everal of them, who have been Hone&s;t in their Actions, and Refin'd in their Language. The &s;econd is, That I know a certain Knight, who, though he &s;hould be allow'd to be a Gentleman born, yet is not a fine Gen|tleman. I &s;hall only add, that I would advi&s;e for the future, all the fine Gentlemen,
<PB N="10" REF="17">
who travel to <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Tipperary,</HI> to allow us <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to know what we mean, when we &s;peak our native Language.</P>
<P>To give a true Character of this charming Comedy, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd, that there is no great Ma&s;ter&s;hip in the De&s;ign of it. Sir <HI>George</HI> had but little of the artful and ju&s;t De&s;igns of <HI>Ben John&s;on:</HI> But as Tragedy in&s;tructs chiefly by its De&s;ign, Comedy in&s;tructs by its Characters; which nor only ought to be drawn truly in Nature, but to be the re&s;embling Pictures of our Contemporaries, both in Court and Town. Tragedy an&s;wers to Hi&s;tory|Painting, but Comedy to drawing of Portraits.</P>
<P>How little do they know of the Nature of true Comedy, who believe that its proper Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et us Patterns for lmitation: For all &s;uch Patterns are &s;erious Things, and Laugh|ter is the Life, and the very Soul of Comedy. 'Tis its proper Bu&s;ine&s;s to expo&s;e Per&s;ons to our View, who&s;e Views we may &s;hun, and who&s;e Fol|lies we may de&s;pi&s;e; and by &s;hew|ing us what is done upon the Comick Stage, to &s;hew us what ought never
<PB N="11" REF="18">
to be done upon the Stage of the World.</P>
<P>All the Characters in Sir <HI>Foppling Flutter,</HI> and e&s;pecially the principal Characters, are admirably drawn, both to plea&s;e and to in&s;truct. Fir&s;t, they are drawn to plea&s;e, becau&s;e they are drawn in the Truth of Nature; but to be drawn in the Truth of Nature, they mu&s;t be drawn with tho&s;e Qualities that are proper to each re&s;pective Sea|&s;on of Life.</P>
<P>This is the chief Precept given for the forming the Characters, by the two Great Ma&s;ters of the Rules which Na|ture her&s;elf dictated, and which have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in every Age, for the Stan|dards of writing &s;ucce&s;sfully, and of judging &s;urely, unle&s;s it were with Poeta&s;ters, and their fooli&s;h Admirers. The Words of <HI>Horace,</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> are the&s;e, <HI>v.</HI> 153.</P>
<Q><L>Tu, quid ego &amp; populo mecum de&s;ideret, audi.</L>
<L>Si &s;e&s;&s;oris eges aulaea manentis, &amp; u&s;que</L>
<L>Se&s;&s;uri, donec cantor, vos plaudite, dicat;</L>
<L>Aetatis cuju&s;que notandi &s;unt tibi mores,</L>
<L>Mobilib&uacute;&s;que decor naturis dandus, &amp; annis.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19">
And thus my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> has tran&s;lated it:</P>
<Q><L>Now hear what ev'ry AUditor expects,</L>
<L>If you intend that he &s;hould &s;tay to hear</L>
<L>The Epilogue, and &s;ee the Curtain fall;</L>
<L>Mark how our Tempers alter with our Tears,</L>
<L>Then give the Beauty proper to each Age,</L>
<L>And by this Rule form all your Chara|cters.</L></Q>
<P>And now &s;ee the Character that <HI>Ho|race</HI> gives of a Per&s;on who is in the Bloom of his Years.</P>
<Q><BIBL>De Arte Poetica, v. 161.</BIBL>
<L>Imberbis tandem juvenis cu&s;tode remoto,</L>
<L>Gaudet equis, canib&uacute;&s;que, &amp; aprici gramine campi;</L>
<L>Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus a&s;per,</L>
<L>Utilium tardus provi&s;or, prodigus aeris,</L>
<L>Sublimis, cupid&uacute;&s;que, &amp; amata relin|quere pernix.</L></Q>
<P>And thus the 'fore&s;aid Noble Poet tran&s;lates it:</P>
<Q><L>A Youth that fir&s;t ca&s;ts off his Tutor'S Yoke,</L>
<L>Loves Hor&s;es, HounDs, and Sports, and Exerci&s;e;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="20">
Prone to all Vice, impatient of Reproof,</L>
<L>Proud, carele&s;s, fond, incon&s;tant, and profu&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>Now, <HI>Horace,</HI> to &s;hew the Importance of this Precept, as &s;oon as he has done with the Characters of the four Parts of Life, returns to it, repeats it, and enforces it.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ibid, v. 176.</BIBL>
<L>&mdash;Ne fort&egrave; &s;eniles</L>
<L>Mandentur juveni partes, puer&oacute;que vi|riles,</L>
<L>Semper in adjunctis, aev&oacute;que morabimur aptis.</L></Q>
<P><Q>That a Poet may never be guilty of &s;uch an Ab&s;urdity, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> as to give the Character of an Old Man to a Young Man, or of a Boy to a Middle Ag'd Man, let him take Care to adhere to tho&s;e Qualities, which are nece&s;&s;arily or probably annexed to each re&s;pective Sea&s;on of Life.</Q></P>
<P>If a Dramatick Poet does not ob&s;erve this Rule, he mi&s;&s;es that which gives the Beauty, and the Decorum, which alone can make his Characters plea&s;e.</P>
<P>As <HI>Horace</HI> is but an Epitomizer of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in giving Rules for the Characters;
<PB N="14" REF="21">
that Philo&s;opher gives us more at large the Character of a Per&s;on in his early Bloom, in the 14th Chapter of the Second Book of his Rheto|rick.</P>
<P><Q>Young Men, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> have &s;trong Ap|petites, and are ready to undertake any thing, in order to &s;atisfy them; and of all tho&s;e Appetites which have a Relation to the Body, they are mo&s;t powerfully &s;way'd by Venereal ones, in which they are very changeable, and are quickly cloy'd. For their De&s;ires are rather acute than la&s;ting; like the Hunger and Thir&s;t of the Sick. They are prone to Anger, and ea&s;ily provok'd; vehement in their Anger, and ready to obey the Dictates of it. For by Rea&s;on of the Concern which they have for their Honour, they cannot bear the being undervalu'd, but re&s;ent an Affront heinou&s;ly. And as they are de&s;i|rous of Honour, they are more ambitious of Victory: For Youth is de&s;irous of ex|celling, and Victory is a Sort of Excel|lency.</Q> Thus far <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI></P>
<P>And here it may not be ami&s;s to &s;hew, that this Rule is founded in Rea&s;on and in Nature: In order to which, let us &s;ee what <HI>Dacier</HI> remarks upon that Ver&s;e of <HI>Horace,</HI> which we cited above.</P>
<Q><PB N="15" REF="22">
Mobilib&uacute;&s;que decor naturis dandus, &amp; annis.</Q>
<P>Behold, &s;ays he, a very fine, and very &s;ignificant Ver&s;e; which tells us, if we render it Word for Word, <Q>That we ought to give to moveable Natures and Years their proper Beauty. By moveable Natures, (<HI>&s;ays</HI> Dacier) <HI>Horace</HI> means Age, which &s;till runs on like a River, and which, as it runs, gives different Inclina|tions to Men; and tho&s;e different Inclina|tions make what he calls <HI>Decor,</HI> the Beau|ty proper to the Age. For every Part of Man's Life has its proper Beauties, like every Sea&s;on of the Year. He that gives to Manly Age the Beauties of Youth, or to Youth the Beauties of Manly Age, does like a Painter, who &s;hould paint the Au|tumn with the Ornaments of Summer, or the Summer with the Ornaments of Au|tumn.</Q></P>
<P>A Comick Poet, who gives to a Young Man the Qualities that belong to a Mid|dle Ag'd Man, or to an Old Man, can an&s;wer neither of the Ends of his Art. He cannot plea&s;e, becau&s;e he writes out of Nature, of which all Poetry is an Imitation, and without which, no Poem can po&s;&s;ibly plea&s;e. And as he cannot

plea&s;e, he cannot in&s;truct; becau&s;e, by &s;hewing &s;uch a young Man as is not to be &s;een in the World, he &s;hews a Mon|&s;ter, and not a Man, &s;ets before us a particular Character, in&s;tead of an alle|gorical and univer&s;al one, as all his Characters, and e&s;pecially his principal Characters, ought to be; and therefore can give no general In&s;truction, having no Moral, no Fable, and therefore no Comedy.</P>
<P>Now if any one is plea&s;ed to com|pare the Character of <HI>Dorimont,</HI> to which the Knight has taken &s;o much ab&s;urd Exception with the two foremen|tioned De&s;criptions, he will find in his Character all the chief di&s;tingui&s;hing Strokes of them. For &s;uch is the Force of Nature, and &s;o admirable a Talent had &s;he given Sir <HI>George</HI> for Comedy, that, tho' to my certain Knowledge he un|der&s;tood neither <HI>Greek</HI> nor <HI>Latin,</HI> yet one would &s;wear, that in drawing his <HI>Do|rimant,</HI> he copy'd the fore&s;aid Draughts, and e&s;pecially that of <HI>Ari&s;totle. Do|rimont</HI> is a young Courtier, haughty, vain, and prone to Anger, amorous, fal&s;e, and incon&s;tant. He debauches <HI>Loveit,</HI> and betrays her; loves <HI>Belinda,</HI> and as &s;oon as he enjoys her is fal&s;e to her.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">
But 2dly, The Characters in Sir <HI>Fop|ling</HI> are admirably contriv'd to plea&s;e, and more particularly the principal ones, becau&s;e we find in tho&s;e Cha|racters, a true Re&s;emblance of the Per|&s;ons both in Court and Town, who liv'd at the Time when that Comedy was writ: For <HI>Rapin</HI> tells us with a great deal of Judgment, <Q>That Comedy is as it ought to be, when an Audience is apt to imagine, that in&s;tead of being in the Pit and Boxes, they are in &s;ome A&s;&s;embly of the Neighbourhood, or in &s;ome Family Meeting, and that we &s;ee nothing done in it, but what is done in the World. For it is, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> not worth one Farthing, if we do not di&s;cover our &s;elves in it, and do not find in it both our own Manners, and tho&s;e of the Per&s;ons with whom we live and conver&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this Rule is manife&s;t: For as 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Comick Poet to cure his Spectators of Vice and Folly, by the Apprehen&s;ion of being laugh'd at; 'tis plain that his Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be with the reigning Follies and Vices. The violent Pa&s;&s;ions, which are the Subjects of Tragedy, are the &s;ame in every Age, and appear with the &s;ame Face; but tho&s;e Vices and Follies, which
<PB N="18" REF="25">
are the Subjects of Comedy, are &s;een to vary continually: Some of tho&s;e that belonged to our Ance&s;tors, have no Relation to us; and can no more come under the Cogni&s;ance of our pre&s;ent Comick Poets, than the Sweating and Sneezing Sickne&s;s can come under the Practice of our contemporary Phy&s;icians. What Vices and Follies may infect tho&s;e who are to come after us, we know not; 'tis the pre&s;ent, the reigning Vices, and Follies, that mu&s;t be the Subjects of our pre&s;ent Comedy: The Comick Po|et therefore mu&s;t take Characters from &s;uch Per&s;ons as are his Contemporaries, and are infected with the fore&s;aid Fol|lies and Vices.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, is the Advice which <HI>Boileau,</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> gives to the Comick Poets:</P>
<Q><L>Etudiez la Cour, &amp; connoi&s;&s;ez la ville,</L>
<L>L'une &amp; l'autre e&s;t tou&s;oers en modeles fertile,</L>
<L>Ce&s;t par l&aacute; que Moliere illu&s;trant &s;es evrits,</L>
<L>Peutetre de &s;on Art eut remport&eacute; la prix, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Now I remember very well, that upon the fir&s;t acting this Comedy, it
<PB N="19" REF="26">
was generally believed to be an agree|able Repre&s;entation of the Per&s;ons of Condition of both Sexes, both in Court and Town; and that all the World was charm'd with <HI>Dorimont</HI>; and that it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that he had in him &s;everal of the Qualities of <HI>Wil|mot</HI> Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> as, his Wit, his Spirit, his amorous Temper, the Charms that he had for the fair Sex, his Fal&s;|hood, and his Incon&s;tancy; the agree|able Manner of his chiding his Servants, which the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> takes Notice of in his Life; and la&s;tly, his repeating, on every Occa&s;ion, the Ver|&s;es of <HI>Waller,</HI> for whom that noble Lord had a very particular E&s;teem; witne&s;s his lmitation of the Tenth Sa|tire of the Fir&s;t Book of <HI>Horace:</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Waller,</HI> by Nature for the Bays de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>With Spirit, Force, and Fancy unconfind,</L>
<L>In Panegyrick is above Mankind.</L></Q>
<P>Now, as &s;everal of the Qualities in <HI>Dorimont</HI>'s Character were taken from that Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> &s;o they who were acquainted with the late Sir <HI>Fleet|wood Shepherd,</HI> know very well, that not a little of that Gentleman's Cha|racter is to be found in Medley.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27">
But the Characters in this Comedy are very well form'd to in&s;truct as well as to plea&s;e, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Dorimont</HI> and of <HI>Loveit</HI>; and they in&s;truct by the &s;ame Qualities to which the Knight has taken &s;o much whim&s;ical Exception; as <HI>Dori|mont</HI> in&s;tructs by his In&s;ulting, and his Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>Loveit</HI> by the Vio|lence of her Re&s;entment and her An|gui&s;h. For <HI>Loveit</HI> has Yough, Beauty, Quality, Wit, and Spirit. And it was depending upon the&s;e, that &s;he repos'd &s;o dangerous a Tru&s;t in <HI>Dorimont,</HI> which is a ju&s;t Caution to the Fair Sex, never to be &s;o conceited of the Power of their Charms, or their other extraor|dinaryQualities,as to believe they can en|gage a Man to be true to them, to whom they grant the be&s;t Favour, without the only &s;ure Engagement, without which they can never be certain, that they &s;hall not be hated and de&s;pis'd by that very Per&s;on whom they have done every Thing to oblige.</P>
<P>To conclude with one General Ob|&s;ervation, That Comedy may be qua|lify'd in a powerful Manner both to in&s;truct and to plea&s;e, the very Con&s;ti|tution of its Subject ought always to be Ridiculous. Comedy, &s;ays <HI>Rapin,</HI> is an Image of common Life, and its
<PB N="21" REF="28">
End is to expo&s;e upon the Stage the De|fects of particular Per&s;ons, in order to cure the Defects of the Publick, and to correct and amend the People, by the Fear of being laugh'd at. That therefore, &s;ays he, which is mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial to Comedy, is certainly the Ri|dicule.</P>
<P>Every Poem is qualify'd to in&s;truct, and to plea&s;e mo&s;t powerfully by that very Quality which makes the Fort and the Characteri&s;tick of it, and which di|&s;tingui&s;hes it from all other Kinds of Poems. As <HI>Tragedy</HI> is qualify'd to in|&s;truct and to plea&s;e, by Terror and Compa&s;&s;ion, which two Pa&s;&s;ions ought always to be predominant in it, and to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all other Poems. <HI>E|pick Poetry</HI> plea&s;es and in&s;tructs chiefly by Admiration, which reigns through|out it, and di&s;tingui&s;hes it from Poems of every other Kind. Thus <HI>Comedy</HI> in|&s;tructs and plea&s;es mo&s;t powerfully by the Ridicule, becau&s;e that is the Qua|lity which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from every other Poem. The Subject therefore of every Comedy ought to be ridiculous by its Con&s;titution; the Ridicule ought to be of the very Nature and E&s;&s;ence of it. Where there is none of that, there can be no Comedy. It ought to
<PB N="22" REF="29">
reign both in the Incidents and in the Characters, and e&s;pecially in the prin|cipal Characters, which ought to be ri|diculous in them&s;elves, or &s;o contriv'd, as to &s;hew and expo&s;e the Ridicule of others. In all the Ma&s;terpieces of <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> the principal Character has the Ridicule in him&s;elf, as <HI>Moro&s;e</HI> in <HI>The Silent Woman, Volpone</HI> in <HI>The Fox,</HI> and <HI>Subtle</HI> and <HI>Face</HI> in <HI>The Alchimi&s;t:</HI> And the very Ground and Foundation of all the&s;e <HI>Comedies</HI> is ridiculous. 'Tis the very &s;ame Thing in the Ma&s;ter-pieces of <HI>Moliere.</HI> The <HI>Mis- Antrope,</HI> the <HI>Impo&s;tor,</HI> the <HI>Avare,</HI> and the <HI>Femmes Secuanter.</HI> Nay, the Reader will find, that in mo&s;t of his other Pieces, the principal Characters are ridiculous; as, <HI>L'Etoardy, Les precieu&s;es Ridicules, Le Cocu Imaginaire, Le Fa&s;cheux,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de pou&s;ceaugnac, Le Bour|geois Gentilhomme, L'Ecole de Maris, L'Ecole des Femmes, L'Amour Medicis, Le Medicin Malgr&eacute; luy, La Mariage Forc&eacute;, George Dandin, Les Fourberies de Scapin, Le Malade Imaginaire.</HI> The Reader will not only find, upon Re|flection, that in all the&s;e Pieces the principal Characters are ridiculous, but that in mo&s;t of them there is the Ridi|cule of <HI>Comedy</HI> in the very Titles.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">
'Tis by the Ridicule that there is in the Character of Sir <HI>Fopling,</HI> which is one of the principal ones of this <HI>Co|medy,</HI> and from which it takes its Name, that he is &s;o very well qualify'd to plea&s;e and to in&s;truct. What true <HI>Eng|gli&s;hman</HI> is there, but mu&s;t be pleas'd to &s;ee this ridiculous Knight made the Je&s;t and the Scorn of all the other Cha|racters, for &s;hewing, by his fooli&s;h aping foreign Cu&s;toms and Manners, that he prefers another Country to his own? And of what important In&s;truction mu&s;t it be to all our Youth who travel, to &s;hew them, that if they &s;o far forget the Love of their Country, as to de|clare by their e&s;pou&s;ing foreign Cu|&s;toms and Manners, that they prefer <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at their Return, they mu&s;t ju&s;tly expect to be the Je&s;t and the Scorn of their own Countrymen.</P>
<P>Thus, I hope, I have convinc'd the Reader, that this Comical Knight, Sir <HI>Fopling,</HI> has been ju&s;tly form'd by the Knight his Father, to in&s;truct and plea&s;e, whatever may be the Opinion to the contrary of the Knight his Brother.</P>
<P>Whenever <HI>The Fine Gentleman</HI> of the latter comes upon the Stage, I &s;hall be
<PB N="24" REF="31">
glad to &s;ee that it has all the &s;hining Qua|lities which recommend Sir <HI>Fopling,</HI> that his Characters are always drawn in Na|ture, and that he never gives to a young Man the Qualities of a Middle-aged Man, or an old one; that they are the ju&s;t Images of our Contemporaries, and of what we every Day &s;ee in the World; that in&s;tead of &s;etting us Patterns for our Imitation, which is not the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Comedy,</HI> he makes tho&s;e Fol|lies and Vices ridiculous, which we ought to &s;hun and de&s;pi&s;e; that the Sub|ject of his <HI>Comedy</HI> is comical by its Con|&s;titution; and that the Ridicule is par|ticularly in the Grand Incidents, and in the principal Characters. For a true Comick Poet is a Philo&s;opher, who, like old <HI>Democritus,</HI> always in&s;tructs us laughing.</P>
