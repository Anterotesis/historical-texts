<HEAD>THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic family in the north of <HI>England.</HI> It was printed at <HI>Naples,</HI> in the black letter, in the year 1529. How much &s;ooner it was written does not appear. The principal incidents are &s;uch as were believed in the darke&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity; but the language and con|duct have nothing that &s;avours of barba|ri&s;m. The &s;tile is the pure&s;t <HI>Italian.</HI> If the &s;tory was written near the time when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, it mu&s;t have been between 1095, the aera of the fir&s;t cru&s;ade, and 1243, the date of the la&s;t, or not long afterwards. There is no other circum&s;tance in the work, that can lead us to gue&s;s at the period in which the &s;cene is laid: The names of the actors are evidently fictitious, and probably di&s;gui&s;ed on pur|po&s;e: Yet the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> names of the dome&s;|tics &s;eem to indicate that this work was not
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
compo&s;ed, until the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Arragonian</HI> Kings in <HI>Naples</HI> had made <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> appellations familiar in that country. The beauty of the diction, and the zeal of the author [moderated, however, by &s;in|gular judgment] concur to make me think that the date of the compo&s;ition was little antecedent to that of the impre&s;&s;ion. Let|ters were then in their mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate in <HI>Italy,</HI> and contributed to di&s;pel the em|pire of &s;uper&s;tition, at that time &s;o forcibly attacked by the reformers. It is not un|likely that an artful prie&s;t might endeavour to turn their own arms on the innovators; and might avail him&s;elf of his abilities as an author, to confirm the populace in their ancient errors and &s;uper&s;titions. If this was his view, he has certainly acted with &s;ignal addre&s;s. Such a work as the follow|ing would en&s;lave a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controver&s;y that have been written from the days of <HI>Luther</HI> to the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>This &s;olution of the author's motives is however offered as a mere conjecture. Whatever his views were, or whatever ef|fects the execution of them might have, his work can only be laid before the public
<PB N="v" REF="4">
at pre&s;ent as a matter of entertainment. Even as &s;uch, &s;ome apology for it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Miracles, vi&s;ions, necromancy, dreams, and other preternatural events, are exploded now even from romances. That was not the ca&s;e when our author wrote; much le&s;s when the &s;tory it&s;elf is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened. Belief in every kind of prodigy was &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e dark ages, that an author would not be faithful to the <HI>manners</HI> of the times, who &s;hould omit all mention of them. He is not bound to believe them him&s;elf, but he mu&s;t repre&s;ent his actors as believing them.</P>
<P>If this <HI>air</HI> of <HI>the miraculous</HI> is excu&s;ed, the reader will find nothing el&s;e unworthy of his peru&s;al. Allow the po&s;&s;ibility of the facts, and all the actors comport them&s;elves as per&s;ons would do in their &s;ituation. There is no bomba&s;t, no &s;imiles, flowers, digre&s;&s;ions, or unnece&s;&s;ary de&s;criptions. E|very thing tends directly to the cata&s;trophe. Never is the reader's attention relaxed. The rules of the drama are almo&s;t ob&s;erved throughout the conduct of the piece. The characters are well drawn, and &s;till better maintained. Terror, the author's principal engine, prevents the &s;tory from ever lan|gui&s;hing;
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
and it is &s;o often contra&s;ted by pity, that the mind is kept up in a con&s;tant vici&s;&s;itude of intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons may perhaps think the cha|racters of the dome&s;tics too little &s;erious for the general ca&s;t of the &s;tory; but be&s;ides their oppo&s;ition to the principal per&s;onages, the art of the author is very ob&s;ervable in his conduct of the &s;ubalterns. They di&s;|cover many pa&s;&s;ages e&s;&s;ential to the &s;tory, which could not be well brought to light but by their naivete and &s;implicity: In particular, the womani&s;h terror and foibles of <HI>Bianca,</HI> in the la&s;t chapter, conduce e&s;|&s;entially towards advancing the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>It is natural for a tran&s;lator to be preju|diced in favour of his adopted work. More impartial readers may not be &s;o much &s;truck with the beauties of this piece as I was. Yet I am not blind to my author's defects. I could wi&s;h he had grounded his plan on a more u&s;eful moral than this; that <HI>the &s;ins of fathers are vi&s;ited on their children to the third and fourth generation.</HI> I doubt whe|ther, in his time, any more than at pre&s;ent, ambition curbed its appetite of dominion from the dread of &s;o remote a puni&s;h|ment. And yet this moral is weakened by
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
that le&s;s direct in&s;inuation, that even &s;uch anathema may be diverted by devotion to St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> Here the intere&s;t of the Monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the Author. However, with all its faults, I have no doubt but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader will be plea&s;ed with a &s;ight of this performance. The piety that reigns throughout, the le&s;|&s;ons of virtue that are inculcated, and the rigid purity of the &s;entiments, exempt this work from the cen&s;ure to which romances are but too liable. Should it meet with the &s;ucce&s;s I hope for, I may be encouraged to re-print the original <HI>Italian,</HI> though it will tend to depreciate my own labour. Our language falls far &s;hort of the charms of the <HI>Italian,</HI> both for variety and har|mony. The latter is peculiarly excellent for &s;imple narrative. It is difficult in <HI>Eng|li&s;h to relate</HI> without falling too low or ri&s;ing too high; a fault obviou&s;ly occa&s;ioned by the little care taken to &s;peak pure language in common conver&s;ation. Every <HI>Italian,</HI> or <HI>Frenchman</HI> of any rank, piques him&s;elf on &s;peaking his own tongue correctly and with choice. I cannot flatter my&s;elf with hav|ing done ju&s;tice to my author in this re|&s;pect: His &s;tile is as elegant, as his con|duct
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
of the pa&s;&s;ions is ma&s;terly. It is pity that he did not apply his talents to what they were evidently proper for, the theatre.</P>
<P>I will detain the reader no longer, but to make one &s;hort remark. Though the machinery is invention, and the names of the actors imaginary, I cannot but believe, that the ground-work of the &s;tory is founded on truth. The &s;cene is undoubtedly laid in &s;ome real ca&s;tle. The author &s;eems fre|quently, without de&s;ign, to de&s;cribe par|ticular parts. <HI>The chamber,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>on the right-hand</HI>; <HI>the door on the left-hand</HI>; <HI>the di&s;tance from the chapel to</HI> Condra<HI>'s apart|ment</HI>: The&s;e and other pa&s;&s;ages are &s;trong pre&s;umptions that the author had &s;ome cer|tain building in his eye. Curious per&s;ons, who have lei&s;ure to employ in &s;uch re|&s;earches, may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover in the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> writers the foundation on which our author has built. If a cata&s;trophe, at all re&s;embling that which he de&s;cribes, is be|lieved to have given ri&s;e to this work, it will contribute to intere&s;t the reader, and will make the ca&s;tle of <HI>Otranto</HI> a &s;till more moving &s;tory.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MANFRED,</HI> Prince of <HI>Otranto,</HI> had one &s;on and one daughter: The lat|ter a mo&s;t beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called <HI>Matilda. Conrad,</HI> the &s;on, was three years younger, a homely youth, &s;ickly, and of no promi&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never &s;howed any
<PB N="2" REF="9">
&s;ymptoms of affection to <HI>Matilda. Manfred</HI> had contracted a marriage for his &s;on with the Mar|quis of <HI>Vicenza</HI>'s daughter, <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; and &s;he had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of <HI>Manfred,</HI> that he might celebrate the wedding as &s;oon as <HI>Conrad</HI>'s infirm &s;tate of health would permit. <HI>Manfred</HI>'s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours. The former indeed, apprehending the &s;everity of their Prince's di&s;po&s;ition, did not dare to utter their &s;urmi&s;es on this precipitation. <HI>Hippilita,</HI> his wife, an amiable lady, did &s;ome|times venture to repre&s;ent the danger of marry|ing their only &s;on &s;o early, con&s;idering his great youth, and greater infirmities, but &s;he never received any other an&s;wer than reflections on her own &s;terility, who had given him but one heir. His tenants and &s;ubjects were le&s;s cautious in their di&s;cour&s;es: They attributed this ha&s;ty wedding to the Prince's dread of &s;eeing accom|pli&s;hed an ancient prophecy, which was &s;aid to have pronounced, that <HI>the Ca&s;tle and Lord&s;hip of</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Otranto <HI>&s;hould pa&s;s from the pre&s;ent family, whenever the real owner &s;hould be grown too large to inhabit it.</HI> It was difficult to make any &s;en&s;e of this prophecy; and &s;till le&s;s ea&s;y to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in que&s;tion. Yet the&s;e my&s;teries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the le&s;s to their opi|nion.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Conrad</HI>'s birth-day was fixed for his e&s;pou&s;als. The company was a&s;&s;embled in the chapel of the Ca&s;tle, and every thing ready for beginning the divine office, when <HI>Conrad</HI> him&s;elf was mi&s;&s;ing. <HI>Manfred</HI> impatient of the lea&s;t delay, and who had not ob&s;erved his &s;on retire, di&s;patched one of his attendants to &s;ummon the young Prince. The &s;ervant, who had not &s;taid long enough to have cro&s;&s;ed the court to <HI>Conrad</HI>'s apartment, came running back breathle&s;s, in a frantic manner, his eyes &s;taring, and foaming at the mouth. He &s;aid nothing, but pointed to the court. The company were &s;truck with ter|ror
<PB N="4" REF="11">
and amazement. The Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita,</HI> without knowing what was the matter, but anxi|ous for her &s;on, &s;wooned away. <HI>Manfred,</HI> le&s;s apprehen&s;ive than enraged at the procra&s;tination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his dome&s;tic, a&s;ked imperiou&s;ly, what was the matter? The fellow made no an&s;wer, but continued pointing towards the court-yard; and at la&s;t, after re|peated que&s;tions put to him, cried out, oh! The helmet! the helmet! In the mean time, &s;ome of the company had run into the court, from whence was heard a confu&s;ed noi&s;e of &s;hrieks, horror, and &s;urpri&s;e. <HI>Manfred,</HI> who began to be alarmed at not &s;eeing his &s;on, went him&s;elf to get information of what occa&s;ioned this &s;trange confu&s;ion. <HI>Matilda</HI> remained endeavouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t her mother, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;taid for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and to avoid &s;howing any impatience for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth, &s;he had conceived little affection.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck <HI>Manfred</HI>'s eyes
<PB N="5" REF="12">
was a groupe of his &s;ervants endeavouring to rai&s;e &s;omething that appeared to him a mountain of &s;able plumes. He gazed without believing his &s;ight. What are ye doing? cried <HI>Manfred</HI> wrathfully; where is my &s;on? A volly of voices replied, Oh! My Lord! The Prince! the Prince, the helmet! the helmet! &s;hocked with the&s;e lamentable &s;ounds, and dreading he knew not what; he advanced ha&s;tily,&mdash;but what a &s;ight for a father's eyes!&mdash;he beheld his child da&s;hed to pieces, and almo&s;t buried under an enormous helmet, an hundred times more large than any ca&s;que ever made for human being, and &s;haded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.</P>
<P>The horror of the &s;pectacle, the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phaenomenon before him, took away the Prince's &s;peech. Yet his &s;ilence la&s;ted longer than even grief could occa&s;ion. He fixed his eyes on what he
<PB N="6" REF="13">
wi&s;hed in vain to believe a vi&s;ion; and &s;eemed le&s;s attentive to his lo&s;s, than buried in medi|tation on the &s;tupendous object that had occa|&s;ioned it. He touched, he examined the fatal ca&s;que, nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of the young Prince, divert the eyes of <HI>Manfred</HI> from the portent before him. All who had known his partial fondne&s;s for young <HI>Conrad,</HI> were as much &s;urprized at their Prince's in&s;en&s;ibility, as thunder-&s;truck them&s;elves at the miracle of the helmet. They conveyed the disfigured corp&s;e into the hall, without receiving the lea&s;t direction from <HI>Manfred.</HI> As little was he attentive to the Ladies who remained in the chapel: On the contrary, without mentioning the unhappy Prince&s;&s;es, his wife and daughter, the fir&s;t &s;ounds that dropped from <HI>Manfred</HI>'s lips were, take care of the lady <HI>I&s;abella.</HI></P>
<P>The dome&s;tics, without ob&s;erving the &s;ingu|larity of this direction, were guided by their affection to their mi&s;tre&s;s, to con&s;ider it as pecu|liarly
<PB N="7" REF="14">
addre&s;&s;ed to her &s;ituation, and flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the &s;trange circum&s;tances &s;he heard, except the death of her &s;on. <HI>Matilda,</HI> who doated on her mother, &s;mothered her own grief and amaze|ment, and thought of nothing but a&s;&s;i&s;ting and comforting her afflicted parent. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who had been treated by <HI>Hippolita</HI> like a daughter, and who returned that tenderne&s;s with equal duty and affection, was &s;carce le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous about the Prince&s;s; at the &s;ame time endea|vouring to partake and le&s;&s;en the weight of &s;or|row which &s;he &s;aw <HI>Matilda</HI> &s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s, for whom &s;he had conceived the warme&s;t &s;ym|pathy of friend&s;hip. Yet her own &s;ituation could not help finding its place in her thoughts. She felt no concern for the death of young <HI>Conrad,</HI> except commi&s;eration; and &s;he was not &s;orry to be delivered from a marriage which had pro|mi&s;ed her little felicity, either from her de&s;tined bridegroom, or from the &s;evere temper of <HI>Man|fred,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="15">
who, though he had di&s;tingui&s;hed her by great indulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his cau&s;ele&s;s rigour to &s;uch amiable Prince&s;&s;es as <HI>Hippolita</HI> and <HI>Matilda.</HI></P>
<P>While the Ladies were conveying the wretch|ed mother to her bed, <HI>Manfred</HI> remained in the court, gazing on the ominous ca&s;que, and re|gardle&s;s of the crowd which the &s;trangene&s;s of the event had now a&s;&s;embled around him. The few words he articulated, tended &s;olely to in|quiries, whether any man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the lea&s;t information. However, as it &s;eemed to be the &s;ole object of his curio&s;ity, it &s;oon became &s;o to the re&s;t of the &s;pectators, who&s;e conjectures were as ab&s;urd and improbable, as the cata&s;trophe it&s;elf was unprecedented. In the mid&s;t of their &s;en&s;ele&s;s gue&s;&s;es, a young pea|&s;ant, whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, ob&s;erved that the mira|culous helmet was exactly like that on the figure
<PB N="9" REF="16">
in black marble of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> the Good, one of their former Princes, in the church of <HI>St. Ni|cholas.</HI> Villain! What &s;aye&s;t thou! cried <HI>Man|fred,</HI> &s;tarting from his trance in a tempe&s;t of rage, and &s;eizing the young man by the collar; how dare&s;t thou utter &s;uch trea&s;on? thy life &s;hall pay for it. The &s;pectators, who as little comprehended the cau&s;e of the Prince's fury as all the re&s;t they had &s;een, were at a lo&s;s to un|ravel this new circum&s;tance. The young pea&s;ant him&s;elf was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed, not conceiving how he had offended the Prince: Yet recollect|ing him&s;elf, with a mixture of grace and hu|mility, he di&s;engaged him&s;elf from <HI>Manfred</HI>'s gripe, and then with an obei&s;ance, which di&s;|covered more jealou&s;y of innocence, than di&s;|may; he a&s;ked, with re&s;pect, of what he was guilty! <HI>Manfred,</HI> more enraged at the vigour, however decently exerted, with which the young man had &s;haken off his hold, than appea&s;|ed by his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, ordered his attendants to &s;eize him, and, if he had not been withheld by his
<PB N="10" REF="17">
friends, whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have poignarded the pea&s;ant in their arms.</P>
<P>During this altercation, &s;ome of the vul|gar &s;pectators had run to the great church, which &s;tood near the ca&s;tle, and came back open-mouthed, declaring, that the helmet was mi&s;&s;ing from <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>'s &s;tatue. <HI>Manfred,</HI> at this news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he &s;ought a &s;ubject on which to vent the tempe&s;t within him, he ru&s;hed again on the young pea|&s;ant, crying, Villain! Mon&s;ter! Sorcerer! 'tis thou ha&s;t done this! 'tis thou ha&s;t &s;lain my &s;on! The mob, who wanted &s;ome object within the &s;cope of their capacities, on whom they might di&s;charge their bewildered rea&s;onings, caught, the words from the mouth of their Lord, and re-ecchoed, ay, ay; 'tis he, 'tis he: He has &s;tolen the helmet from good <HI>Alfon&s;e</HI>'s tomb, and da&s;hed out the brains of our young Prince with it,&mdash;never reflecting how enormous the di&s;pro|portion was between the marble helmet that
<PB N="11" REF="18">
had been in the church, and that of &s;teel before their eyes; nor how impo&s;&s;ible it was for a youth, &s;eemingly not twenty, to weild a piece of armour of &s;o prodigious a weight.</P>
<P>The folly of the&s;e ejaculations brought <HI>Man|fred</HI> to him&s;elf: Yet whether provoked at the pea&s;ant having ob&s;erved the re&s;emblance between the two helmets, and thereby led to the farther di&s;covery of the ab&s;ence of that in the church; or wi&s;hing to bury any fre&s;h rumours under &s;o impertinent a &s;uppo&s;ition; he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a necro|mancer, and that till the church could take cog|nizance of the affair; he would have the Ma|gician, whom they had thus detected, kept pri|&s;oner under the helmet it&s;elf, which he ordered his attendants to rai&s;e, and place the young man under it; declaring he &s;hould be kept there without food, with which his own infernal art might furni&s;h him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19">
It was in vain for the youth to repre&s;ent again&s;t this prepo&s;terous &s;entence: In vain did <HI>Man|fred</HI>'s friends endeavour to divert him from this &s;avage and ill-grounded re&s;olution. The gene|rality were charmed with their Lord's deci&s;ion, which, to their apprehen&s;ions, carried great appearance of ju&s;tice, as the Magician was to be puni&s;hed by the very in&s;trument with which he had offended: Nor were they &s;truck with the lea&s;t compunction at the probability of the youth being &s;tarved, for they firmly believed, that, by his diabolical &s;kill, he could ea&s;ily &s;up|ply him&s;elf with nutriment.</P>
<P><HI>Manfred</HI> thus &s;aw his commands even chear|fully obeyed, and appointing a guard with &s;trict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the pri&s;oner; he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his friends and at|tendants, and retired to his own chamber, after locking the gates of the ca&s;tle, in which he &s;uffered none but his dome&s;tics to remain.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">
In the mean time, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI> to her&s;elf, who amid&s;t the tran&s;ports of her own &s;orrow, frequently demanded news of her Lord, would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her attendants to watch over him, and at la&s;t enjoined <HI>Matilda</HI> to leave her, and vi&s;it and comfort her father. <HI>Matilda,</HI> who wanted no affectionate duty to <HI>Manfred,</HI> though &s;he trembled at his au&s;terity, obeyed the orders of <HI>Hippolita,</HI> whom &s;he tenderly recom|mended to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; and enquiring of the do|me&s;tics for her father, was informed that he was retired to his chamber, and had commanded that nobody &s;hould have admittance to him. Concluding that he was immer&s;ed in &s;orrow for the death of her brother, and fearing to re|new his tears by the &s;ight of his &s;ole remaining child, &s;he he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould break in upon his affliction; yet &s;olicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother, en|couraged her to venture di&s;obeying the orders he had given, a fault &s;he had never been guilty
<PB N="14" REF="21">
of before. The gentle timidity of her nature made her pau&s;e for &s;ome minutes at his door. She heard him traver&s;e his chamber backwards and forwards with di&s;ordered &s;teps; a mood which increa&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions. She was how|ever ju&s;t going to beg admittance, when <HI>Man|fred</HI> &s;uddenly opened his door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the di&s;order of his mind, he did not di&s;tingui&s;h the per&s;on, but a&s;ked angrily, who it was? <HI>Matilda</HI> replied trembling, my deare&s;t father, it is I, your daughter. <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;tepping back ha&s;tily, cried, Begone, I do not want a daughter; and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door again&s;t the ter|rified <HI>Matilda.</HI></P>
<P>She was too well acquainted with her father's impetuo&s;ity to venture a &s;econd intru&s;ion. When &s;he had a little recovered the &s;hock of &s;o bitter a reception, &s;he wiped away her tears to pre|vent the additional &s;tab that the knowledge of it would give to <HI>Hippolita,</HI> who que&s;tioned her in the mo&s;t anxious terms on the health of <HI>Man|fred,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="22">
and how he bore his lo&s;s. <HI>Matild&aacute;</HI> a&s;&s;ured her he was well, and &s;upported his misfortune with manly fortitude. But will he not let me &s;ee him? &s;aid <HI>Hippolita</HI> mornfully; will he not permit me to blend my tears with his, and &s;hed a mother's &s;orrows in the bo&s;om of her Lord?

The gates of the ca&s;tle &s;he knew were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should &s;he, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare <HI>Hippolita</HI> for the cruel de&s;tiny that awaited her; &s;he did not doubt but <HI>Manfred</HI> would &s;eek her there, and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he meditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ions. Delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid mea&s;ures he had conceived, or produce &s;ome circum&s;tance in her favour, if &s;he could for that night at lea&s;t avoid his odious purpo&s;e.&mdash;Yet where conceal her&s;elf! how

avoid the pur&s;uit he would infallibly make throughout the ca&s;tle! As the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed rapidly through her mind, &s;he recollected a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age which led from the vaults of the ca&s;tle to the church of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> Could &s;he reach the altar before &s;he was over|taken, &s;he knew even <HI>Manfred</HI>'s violence would not dare to profane the &s;acredne&s;s of the place; and &s;he determined, if no other means of deli|verance offered, to &s;hut her&s;elf up for ever among the holy virgins, who&s;e convent was contiguous to the cathedral. In this re&s;olution, &s;he &s;eized a lamp that burned at the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, and hurried towards the &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The lower part of the ca&s;tle was hollowed into &s;everal intricate cloy&s;ters; and it was not ea&s;y for one under &s;o much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern. An awful &s;ilence reigned throughout tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous regions, except now and then &s;ome bla&s;ts of wind that &s;hook the doors &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, and

which grating on the ru&s;ty hinges, were re|ecchoed through that long labyrinth of dark|ne&s;s. Every murmur &s;truck her with new ter|ror;&mdash;yet more &s;he dreaded to hear the wrath|ful voice of <HI>Manfred</HI> urging his dome&s;tics to pur&s;ue her. She trod as &s;oftly as impatience would give her leave,&mdash;yet frequently &s;topped and li&s;tened to hear if &s;he was followed. In one of tho&s;e moments &s;he thought &s;he heard a &s;igh. She &s;huddered, and recoiled a few paces. In a moment &s;he thought &s;he heard the &s;tep of &s;ome per&s;on. Her blood curdled; &s;he con|cluded it was <HI>Manfred.</HI> Every &s;ugge&s;tion that horror could in&s;pire ru&s;hed into her mind. She condemned her ra&s;h flight, which had thus ex|po&s;ed her to his rage in a place where her cries were not likely to draw any body to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.&mdash;Yet the &s;ound &s;eemed not to come from behind,&mdash;if <HI>Manfred</HI> knew where &s;he was, he mu&s;t have followed her: She was &s;till in one of the cloy&s;ters, and the &s;teps &s;he had heard were too di&s;tinct to proceed from the way &s;he

had come. Cheared with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not the Prince; &s;he was going to advance, when a door that &s;tood a jar, at &s;ome di&s;tance to the left, was opened gently: But ere her lamp, which &s;he held up, could di&s;cover who opened it, the per&s;on retreated precipitately on &s;eeing the light.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;abella,</HI> whom every incident was &s;ufficient to di&s;may, he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould proceed. Her dread of <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;oon outweighed every other terror. The very circum&s;tance of the per&s;on avoiding her, gave her a &s;ort of courage. It could only be, &s;he thought, &s;ome dome&s;tic belonging to the ca&s;tle. Her gentlene&s;s had never rai&s;ed her an enemy, and con&s;cious in|nocence bade her hope that, unle&s;s &s;ent by the Prince's order to &s;eek her, his &s;ervants would rather a&s;&s;i&s;t than prevent her flight. Fortifying her&s;elf with the&s;e reflections, and believing by what &s;he could ob&s;erve, that &s;he was near the
<PB N="26" REF="33">
mouth of the &s;ubterraneous cavern, &s;he approach|ed the door that had been opened; but a &s;ud|den gu&s;t of wind that met her at the door, extingui&s;hed her lamp, and left her in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Words cannot paint the horror of the Prin|ce&s;s's &s;ituation. Alone in &s;o di&s;mal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day, hopele&s;s of e&s;caping, expecting every moment the arrival of <HI>Manfred,</HI> and far from tranquil on knowing &s;he was within reach of &s;omebody, &s;he knew not whom, who for &s;ome cau&s;e &s;eemed concealed thereabouts, all the&s;e thoughts crouded on her di&s;tracted mind, and &s;he was ready to &s;ink under her apprehen&s;ions. She addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to every Saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For a con&s;iderable time &s;he remained in an agony of de&s;pair. At la&s;t, as &s;oftly as was po&s;&s;ible, &s;he felt for the door, and having found it, entered trembling into the vault from whence &s;he had
<PB N="27" REF="34">
heard the &s;igh and &s;teps. It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moon&s;hine gleam from the roof of the vault, which &s;eemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building, &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h which, that appeared to have been cru&s;hed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this cha&s;m, when &s;he di&s;cerned a human form &s;tanding clo&s;e again&s;t the wall.</P>
<P>She &s;hrieked, believing it the gho&s;t of her betrothed <HI>Conrad.</HI> The figure advancing, &s;aid in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive voice, be not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the &s;tranger, and recollecting that this mu&s;t be the per&s;on who had opened the door, recovered her &s;pirits enough to reply, Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched Prince&s;s, &s;tanding on the brink of de&s;truction: A&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;cape from this fatal ca&s;tle, or in few moments I may be made mi&s;erable for ever.

Lift up the door, &s;aid the Prince&s;s. The &s;tranger obeyed; and beneath appeared &s;ome &s;tone &s;teps de&s;cending into a vault totally dark. We mu&s;t go down here, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella</HI>: Follow me; dark and di&s;mal as it is, we cannot mi&s;s our way; it leads directly to the church of St. <HI>Ni|cholas</HI>&mdash;but perhaps, added the Prince&s;s mo|de&s;tly, you have no rea&s;on to leave the ca&s;tle, nor have I farther occa&s;ion for your &s;ervice; in few minutes I &s;hall be &s;afe from <HI>Manfred</HI>'s rage&mdash;only let me know to whom I am &s;o much obliged.

He tried in vain to open it, not having ob&s;erved <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s method of touching the &s;pring: nor had he many moments to make an e&s;&s;ay.

&s;ave her Lord from any additional &s;hock, and prepared by a &s;eries of grief not to tremble at any acce&s;&s;ion to it; &s;he determined to make her&s;elf the fir&s;t &s;acrifice, if fate had marked the pre&s;ent hour for their de&s;truction.

Coming to him&s;elf, he gave orders that every avenue to the ca&s;tle &s;hould be &s;trictly guarded, and charged his dome&s;tics on pain of their lives to &s;uffer nobody to pa&s;s out.

to whom he &s;poke favourably, he ordered to remain in a &s;mall chamber on the &s;tairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the key of which he took away him&s;elf, telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning.

<P><HI>MATILDA,</HI> who, by <HI>Hippolita</HI>'s order, had retired to her apartment, was ill-di&s;po&s;ed to take any re&s;t. The &s;hocking fate of her brother had deeply affacted her.

What &s;tranger? &s;aid &s;he; and how did&s;t thou come there at this unu&s;ual hour, when all the gates of the ca&s;tle are locked? I am not here willingly: An&s;wered the voice&mdash;but pardon me, Lady, if I have di&s;turbed your re&s;t: I knew not that I was overheard. Sleep had for|&s;aken me: I left a re&s;tle&s;s couch, and came to wa&s;te the irk&s;ome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning, impatient to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this ca&s;tle. Thy words and accents, &s;aid <HI>Matilda,</HI> are of a melancholy ca&s;t: If thou art unhappy, I pity thee.

I am indeed unhappy, &s;aid the &s;tranger; and I know what wealth is: But I do not complain of the lot which heaven has ca&s;t for me: I am young and healthy, and am not a&s;hamed of owing my &s;upport to my&s;elf&mdash;yet think me not proud, or that I di&s;dain your generous offers. I will re|member you in my ori&s;ons, and will pray for ble&s;&s;ings on your gracious &s;elf and your noble mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;if I &s;igh, Lady, it is for others, not for my&s;elf. Now I have it, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Bianca,</HI> whi&s;pering the Prince&s;s. This is certainly the young pea&s;ant; and by my con&s;cience he is in love&mdash;Well! this is a charming adventure!&mdash;do, Madam, let us &s;ift him.

And would you have <HI>me</HI> become a pea&s;ant's confident? &s;aid the Prin|ce&s;s. Well then, let me talk to him: Said <HI>Bi|anca</HI>: Though I have the honour of being your Highne&s;s's maid of honour, I was not always &s;o great: Be&s;ides, if love levels ranks, it rai&s;es them too: I have a re&s;pect for any young man in love&mdash;peace! &s;impleton; &s;aid the Prince&s;s. Though he &s;aid he was unhappy, it does not follow that he mu&s;t be in love. Think of all that has happened to-day, and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love cau&s;es. Stranger, re&s;umed the Prince&s;s, if thy misfortunes have not been occa&s;ioned by thy own fault, and are within the compa&s;s of the Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI>'s power to redre&s;s, I will take upon me to an&s;wer that &s;he will be thy protectre&s;s. When thou art di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this ca&s;tle, repair to holy fa|ther <HI>Jerome</HI> at the convent adjoining to the

Fare|wel: It is not &s;eemly for me to hold farther conver&s;e with a man at this unwonted hour. May the Saints guard thee, gracious Lady! re|plied the pea&s;ant&mdash;but oh! if a poor and worth|le&s;s &s;tranger might pre&s;ume to beg a minute's audience farther&mdash;am I &s;o happy?&mdash;the ca&s;e|ment is not &s;hut&mdash;might I venture to a&s;k&mdash;&s;peak quickly; &s;aid <HI>Matilda,</HI> the morning dawns a pace: Should the labourers come into the fields and perceive us&mdash;What would&s;t thou a&s;k?&mdash;I know not how&mdash;I know not if I dare&mdash;&s;aid the young &s;tranger faltering&mdash;yet the humanity with which you have &s;poken to me emboldens&mdash;Lady! dare I tru&s;t you?&mdash;Heavens! &s;aid <HI>Matilda,</HI> What do&s;t thou mean? with what would&s;t thou tru&s;t me?&mdash;&s;peak boldly, if thy &s;ecret is fit to be entru&s;ted to a virtuous brea&s;t&mdash;I would a&s;k, &s;aid the Pea&s;ant, recollecting

<PB N="76" REF="83">
that is the real motive of your repugnance to your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to en|deavour to harden your heart. The church is an indulgent mother: unfold your griefs to her: &s;he alone can admini&s;ter comfort to your &s;oul, either by &s;atisfying your con&s;cience, or upon examination of your &s;cruples, by &s;etting you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful means of continuing your lineage. In the latter ca&s;e, if the Lady <HI>I&s;abella</HI> can be brought to con&s;ent&mdash;<HI>Manfred,</HI> who concluded that he had either over-reached the good man, or that his fir&s;t warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance, was overjoyed at this &s;udden turn, and repeated the mo&s;t magnificent promi&s;es, if he &s;hould &s;ucceed by the Friar's mediation. The well meaning Prie&s;t &s;uffered him to deceive him&s;elf, fully determined to traver&s;e his views, in&s;tead of &s;econding them.</P>
<P>Since we now under&s;tand one another, re|&s;umed the Prince, I expect, Father, that you
<PB N="77" REF="84">
&s;atisfy me in one point. Who is the youth that I found in the vault? He mu&s;t have been privy to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s flight: Tell me truly; is he her lover? or is he an agent for ano|ther's pa&s;&s;ion? I have often &s;u&s;pected <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s indifference to my &s;on: a thou&s;and circum|&s;tances croud on my mind that confirm that &s;u&s;|picion. She her&s;elf was &s;o con&s;cious of it, that while I di&s;cour&s;ed her in the gallery, &s;he outran my &s;u&s;picions, and endeavoured to ju&s;tify her&s;elf from coolne&s;s to <HI>Conrad.</HI> The Friar, who knew nothing of the youth, but what he had learnt occa&s;ionally from the Prince&s;s, ignorant what was become of him, and not &s;ufficiently reflecting on the impetuo&s;ity of <HI>Manfred</HI>'s temper, conceived that it might not be ami&s;s to &s;ow the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y in his mind: they might be turned to &s;ome u&s;e here|after, either by prejudicing the Prince again&s;t <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> if he per&s;i&s;ted in that union; or by di|verting his attention to a wrong &s;cent, and em|ploying his thoughts on a vi&s;ionary intrigue,

prevent his engaging in any new pur&s;uit. With this unhappy policy, he an&s;wered in a manner to confirm <HI>Manfred</HI> in the belief of &s;ome con|nection between <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and the youth. The Prince, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze, fell into a rage at the idea of what the Friar &s;ugge&s;ted. I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue; cried he; and quitting <HI>Jerome</HI> abruptly, with a command to remain there till his return, he ha&s;tened to the great hall of the ca&s;tle, and ordered the pea&s;ant to be brought before him.</P>
<P>Thou hardened young impo&s;tor! &s;aid the Prince, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the youth; what be|comes of thy boa&s;ted veracity now? it was Pro|vidence, was it, and the light of the moon, that di&s;covered the lock of the trap-door to thee&punc; Tell me, audacious boy, who thou art, and how long thou ha&s;t been acquainted with the Prince&s;s&mdash;and take care to an&s;wer with le&s;s equivocation than thou did&s;t la&s;t night, or tor|tures

&s;hall wring the truth from thee. The young man, perceiving that his &s;hare in the flight of the Prince&s;s was di&s;covered, and con|cluding that any thing he &s;hould &s;ay could no longer be of &s;ervice or detriment to her, re|plied, I am no impo&s;tor, my Lord, nor have I de&s;erved opprobrious language. I an&s;wered to every que&s;tion your Highne&s;s put to me la&s;t night with the &s;ame veracity that I &s;hall &s;peak now: And that will not be from fear of your tortures, but becau&s;e my &s;oul abhors a fal&s;hood. Plea&s;e to repeat your que&s;tions, my Lord; I am ready to give you all the &s;atisfaction in my power. You know my que&s;tions, replied the Prince, and only want time to prepare an eva|&s;ion. Speak directly; who art thou? and how long ha&s;t thou been known to the Prince&s;s? I am a labourer at the next village; &s;aid the pea|&s;ant, my name is <HI>Theodore.</HI> The Prince&s;s found me in the vault la&s;t night: Before that hour I never was in her pre&s;ence.

but I will hear thy own &s;tory, before I examine into the truth of it. Tell me, what rea&s;on did the Prince&s;s give thee for making her e&s;cape? thy life depends to thy an&s;wer. She told me, replied <HI>Theodore,</HI> that &s;he was on the brink of de&s;truction, and that if &s;he could not e&s;cape from the ca&s;tle, &s;he was in danger in a few moments of being made mi&s;erable for ever. And on this &s;light foundation, on a &s;illy girl's report, &s;aid <HI>Manfred,</HI> thou did&s;t hazard my di&s;plea&s;ure! I fear no man's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid <HI>Theodore,</HI> when a woman in di&s;tre&s;s puts her&s;elf under my pro|tection&mdash;During this examination, <HI>Matilda</HI> was going to the apartment of <HI>Hippolita.</HI> At the upper end of the hall, where <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;at, was a boarded gallery with latticed windows, thro' which <HI>Matilda</HI> and <HI>Bianca</HI> were to pa&s;s. Hear|ing her father's voice, and &s;eeing the &s;ervants a&s;&s;embled round him, &s;he &s;topped to learn the occa&s;ion. The pri&s;oner &s;oon drew her atten|tion: The &s;teady and compo&s;ed manner in which he an&s;wered, and the gallantry of his

His per|&s;on was noble, hand&s;ome, and commanding, even in that &s;ituation: But his countenance &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed her whole care. Heavens! <HI>Bi|anca,</HI> &s;aid the Prince&s;s &s;oftly, do I dream? or is not that youth the exact re&s;emblance of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>'s picture in the gallery? She could &s;ay no more, for her father's voice grew louder at every word. This bravado, &s;aid he, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all thy former in&s;olence. Thou &s;halt experience the wrath with which thou dare&s;t to trifle. Seize him, con|tinued <HI>Manfred,</HI> and bind him&mdash;the fir&s;t news the Prince&s;s hears of her champion &s;hall be, that he has lo&s;t his head for her &s;ake. The in|ju&s;tice of which thou art guilty towards me, &s;aid <HI>Theodore,</HI> convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Prince&s;s from thy tyranny. May &s;he be happy, whatever be|comes of me! This is a Lover! cried <HI>Manfred</HI> in a rage: A pea&s;ant within &s;ight of death is not

Thou ha&s;t threatened me with death already, &s;aid the youth, for the truth I have told thee: If that is all the encouragement I am to expect for &s;incerity, I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curio&s;ity farther. Then thou wilt not &s;peak! &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI>; I will not, replied he. Bear him away into the court-yard, &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI>; I will &s;ee his head this in&s;tant &s;e|vered from his body&mdash;<HI>Matilda</HI> fainted at hear|ing tho&s;e words. <HI>Bianca</HI> &s;hrieked, and cried, Help! help! the Prince&s;s is dead! <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;tarted at this ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter! The young pea&s;ant, who heard it too, was &s;truck with horror, and a&s;ked eagerly the &s;ame que&s;tion; but <HI>Manfred</HI> ordered him to be hurried into the court, and kept there for execution, till he had informed him&s;elf of the cau&s;e of <HI>Bianca</HI>'s &s;hrieks.

apartment, he ru&s;hed into the court, and call|ing for one of his guards, bade <HI>Theodore</HI> kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.</P>
<P>The undaunted youth received the bitter &s;en|tence with a re&s;ignation that touched every heart, but <HI>Manfred</HI>'s. He wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to know the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Prince&s;s; but fearing to exa&s;pe|rate the tyrant more again&s;t her, he de&s;i&s;ted. The only boon he deigned to a&s;k, was, that he might be permitted to have a confe&s;&s;or, and make his peace with heaven. <HI>Manfred,</HI> who hoped by the confe&s;&s;or's means to come at the youth's hi&s;tory, readily granted his reque&s;t: and being convinced that Father <HI>Jerome</HI> was now in his intere&s;t, he ordered him to be called and &s;hrift the pri&s;oner. The holy man, who had little fore&s;een the cata&s;trophe that his im|prudence occa&s;ioned, fell on his knees to the Prince, and adjured him in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner not to &s;hed innocent blood. He ac|cu&s;ed
<PB N="84" REF="91">
him&s;elf in the bittere&s;t terms for his indi&s;|cretion, endeavoured to di&s;culpate the youth, and left no method untried to &s;often the tyrant's rage. <HI>Manfred,</HI> more incen&s;ed than appea&s;ed by <HI>Jerome</HI>'s interce&s;&s;ion, who&s;e retractation now made him &s;u&s;pect he had been impo&s;ed upon by both, commanded the friar to do his duty, tell|ing him he would not allow the pri&s;oner many minutes for confe&s;&s;ion. Nor do I a&s;k many, my Lord, &s;aid the unhappy young man. My &s;ins, thank heaven! have not been numerous; nor exceed what might be expected at my years. Dry your tears, good father, and let us di&s;|patch: This is a bad world; nor have I had cau&s;e to leave it with regret. Oh! wretched youth! &s;aid <HI>Jerome,</HI> how can&s;t thou bear the fight of me with patience? I am thy murderer! it is I have brought this di&s;mal hour upon thee! I forgive thee from my &s;oul, &s;aid the youth, as I hope heaven will pardon me. Hear my con|fe&s;&s;ion, father, and give me thy ble&s;&s;ing. How can I prepare thee for thy pa&s;&s;age, as I ought?
<PB N="85" REF="92">
&s;aid <HI>Jerome.</HI> Thou can&s;t not be &s;aved without pardoning thy foes&mdash;and can&s;t thou forgive that impious man there! I can; &s;aid <HI>Theodore</HI>; I do&mdash;And does not this touch thee! cruel Prince! &s;aid the Friar. I &s;ent for thee to con|fe&s;s him, &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;ternly; not to plead for him. Thou did&s;t fir&s;t incen&s;e me again&s;t him&mdash;his blood be on thy head; It will! it will! &s;aid the good man, in an agony of &s;orrow. Thou and I mu&s;t never hope to go, where this ble&s;&s;ed youth is going! Di&s;patch! &s;aid <HI>Man|fred</HI>: I am no more to be moved by the whin|ing of prie&s;ts, than by the &s;hrieks of women. What! &s;aid the youth; is it po&s;&s;ible that my fate could have occa&s;ioned what I heard! is the Prince&s;s then again in thy power? Thou do&s;t but remember me of thy wrath, &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI>: Prepare thee, for this moment is thy la&s;t. The youth, who felt his indignation ri&s;e, and who was touched with the &s;orrow which he &s;aw he had infu&s;ed into all the &s;pectators, as well as into the Friar, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his emotions; and put|ting
<PB N="86" REF="93">
off his doublet, and unbuttoning his collar, knelt down to his prayers. As he &s;tooped, his &s;hirt &s;lipped down below his &s;houlder, and di&s;|covered the mark of a bloody arrow. Gracious heaven! cried the holy man &s;tarting, what do I &s;ee! it is my child! my <HI>Theodore</HI>!</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions that en&s;ued, mu&s;t be conceived; they cannot be painted. The tears of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants were &s;u&s;pended by wonder, rather than &s;topped by joy. They &s;eemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what they ought to feel. Surpri&s;e, doubt, tenderne&s;s, re&s;pect, &s;ucceeded each other in the countenance of the youth. He received with mode&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the effu&s;ion of the old man's tears and embraces: Yet afraid of giving a loo&s;e to hope, and &s;u&s;pecting from what had pa&s;&s;ed the inflexibility of <HI>Manfred</HI>'s temper, he ca&s;t a glance towards the Prince, as if to &s;ay, can&s;t thou be unmoved at &s;uch a &s;cene as this?</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="94">
<HI>Manfred</HI>'s heart was capable of being touched. He forgot his anger in his a&s;toni&s;hment: Yet his pride forbade his owning him&s;elf affected. He even doubted whether this di&s;covery was not a contrivance of the friar to &s;ave the youth. What may this mean? &s;aid he: How can he be thy &s;on? is it con&s;i&s;tent with thy profe&s;&s;ion or reputed &s;anctity to avow a pea&s;ant's offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours! Oh! God, &s;aid the holy man, do&s;t thou que&s;tion his being mine? could I feel the angui&s;h I do, if I were not his father? Spare him! good Prince, &s;pare him! and revile me as thou plea&s;e&s;t. Spare him! &s;pare him, cried the attendants, for this good man's &s;ake! Peace! &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI> &s;ternly: I mu&s;t know more, ere I am di&s;po&s;ed to pardon. A Saint's ba&s;tard may be no &s;aint him&s;elf. In|jurious Lord! &s;aid <HI>Theodore</HI>; add not in&s;ult to cruelty.

<P><HI>Jerome</HI> falling on the neck of his &s;on, di&s;|charged a flood of tears, that &s;poke the fullne&s;s of his &s;oul.

<P>It was in vain for the holy man to reply. <HI>Manfred</HI> commanded him to be conducted to the po&s;tern-gate, and &s;hut out from the ca&s;tle:
<PB N="94" REF="101">
And he ordered &s;ome of his attendants to carry <HI>Theodore</HI> to the top of the black tower, and guard him &s;trictly; &s;carce permitting the Father and &s;on to exchange a ha&s;ty embrace at parting. He then withdrew to the hall, and &s;eating him|&s;elf in princely &s;tate, ordered the Herald to be admitted to his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Well! thou in&s;olent! &s;aid the Prince, what would&s;t thou with me! I come, replied he, to thee, <HI>Manfred,</HI> u&s;urper of the principality of <HI>Otranto,</HI> from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the gigantic &s;abre: in the name of his Lord, <HI>Frederic</HI> Marquis of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> he de|mands the Lady <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> daughter of that Prince, whom thou ha&s;t ba&s;ely and traiterou&s;ly got into thy power, by bribing her fal&s;e guardians during his ab&s;ence: and he requires thee to re&s;ign the principality of <HI>Otranto,</HI> which thou ha&s;t u&s;urped from the &s;aid Lord <HI>Frederic,</HI> the neare&s;t of blood to the la&s;t rightful Lord <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> the good.

<P>And where is this braggart, who &s;ends thee? &s;aid <HI>Manfred.</HI> At the di&s;tance of a league, &s;aid the Herald: he comes to make good his Lord's claim again&s;t thee, as he is a true Knight and thou an u&s;urper and ravi&s;her.</P>
<P>Injurious as this challenge was, <HI>Manfred</HI> re|flected that it was not his intere&s;t to provoke the Marquis. He knew how well-founded the claim of <HI>Frederic</HI> was; nor was this the fir&s;t time he had heard of it. <HI>Frederic</HI>'s ance&s;tors had a&s;&s;umed the &s;tyle of Princes of <HI>Otranto,</HI> from the death of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> the good without i&s;&s;ue; but <HI>Manfred,</HI> his Father, and grandfather, had been too powerful for the hou&s;e of <HI>Vicenza</HI> to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s them. <HI>Frederic,</HI> a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful young Lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who
<PB N="96" REF="103">
had died in childbed of <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> Her death affected him &s;o much, that he had taken the cro&s;s and gone to the holy land, where he was wounded in an engagement again&s;t the infidels, made pri&s;oner, and reported to be dead. When the news reached <HI>Manfred</HI>'s ears, he bribed the guardians of the Lady <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to deliver her up to him as a bride for his &s;on <HI>Conrad,</HI> by which alliance he had propo&s;ed to unite the claims of the two hou&s;es. This motive, on <HI>Conrad</HI>'s death, had cooperated to make him &s;o &s;uddenly re&s;olve on e&s;pou&s;ing her him&s;elf; and the &s;ame reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the con&s;ent of <HI>Frederic</HI> to this marriage. A like policy in&s;pired him with the thought of inviting <HI>Frederic</HI>'s champion into his ca&s;tle, le&s;t he &s;hould be informed of <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s flight, which he &s;trictly enjoined his dome&s;tics not to di&s;clo&s;e to any of the Knight's retinue.</P>

and tell him, ere we liquidate our differences by the &s;word, <HI>Manfred</HI> would hold &s;ome con|ver&s;e with him. Bid him welcome to my ca&s;tle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he &s;hall have courteous reception, and full &s;ecurity for him&s;elf and followers. If we cannot adju&s;t our quarrel by amicable means, I &s;wear he &s;hall depart in &s;afety, and &s;hall have full &s;atisfaction according to the laws of arms: So help me God and his holy Trinity! the Herald made three obei&s;&s;ances and retired.</P>
<P>During this interview <HI>Jerome</HI>'s mind was agi|tated by a thou&s;and contrary pa&s;&s;ions. He trembled for the life of his &s;on, and his fir&s;t thought was to per&s;uade <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to return to the ca&s;tle. Yet he was &s;carce le&s;s alarmed at the thought of her union with <HI>Manfred.</HI> He dreaded <HI>Hippolita</HI>'s unbounded &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of her Lord; and though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to con&s;ent to a divorce, if he could get acce&s;s to her; yet &s;hould <HI>Manfred</HI>

di&s;cover that the ob&s;truction came from him, it might be equally fatal to <HI>Theodore.</HI> He was impatient to know whence came the Herald, who with &s;o little management had que&s;tioned the title of <HI>Manfred</HI>: yet he did not dare ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the convent, le&s;t <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;hould leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He returned di&s;con&s;olately to the mona&s;tery, uncertain on what conduct to re&s;olve. A Monk, who met him in the porch and ob&s;erved his melancholy air, &s;aid, alas! brother, is it then true that we have lo&s;t our excellent Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI>? The holy man &s;tarted, and cried, what meane&s;t thou, brother! I come this in&s;tant from the ca&s;tle, and left her in perfect health. <HI>Martelli,</HI> replied the other Friar, pa&s;&s;ed by the convent but a quarter of an Hour ago on his way from the ca&s;tle, and reported that her Highne&s;s was dead. All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy tran&s;it to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival. They know thy holy attach|ment to that good Lady, and are anxious for

I know not, &s;aid the Friar: She wept much, and &s;aid &s;he would retire to her chamber. <HI>Jerome</HI> left his comrade abruptly, and ha&s;ted to the Prince&s;s, but &s;he
<PB N="100" REF="107">
was not in her chamber. He inquired of the dome&s;tics of the convent, but could learn no news of her. He &s;earched in vain throughout the mona&s;tery and the church, and di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers round the neighbourhood, to get intelligence if &s;he had been &s;een; but to no pur|po&s;e. nothing could equal the good man's per|plexity. He judged that <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;u&s;pecting <HI>Manfred</HI> of having precipitated his wife's death, had taken the alarm, and withdrawn her&s;elf to &s;ome more &s;ecret place of concealment. This new flight would probably carry the Prince's fury to the height. The report of <HI>Hippolita</HI>'s death, though it &s;eemed almo&s;t incredible, in|crea&s;ed his con&s;ternation; and though <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s e&s;cape be&s;poke her aver&s;ion of <HI>Manfred</HI> for a hu&s;band, <HI>Jerome</HI> could feel no comfort from it, while it endangered the life of his &s;on.

The Prince, in the mean time, had pa&s;&s;ed into the court, and ordered the gates of the ca&s;tle to be flung open for the reception of the &s;tranger Knight and his train. In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived. Fir&s;t came two harbin|gers with wands. Next a herald, followed by two pages and two trumpets. Then an hundred foot-guards. The&s;e were attended by as many hor&s;e. After them fifty footman, clothed in &s;carlet and black, the colours of the Knight. Then a led hor&s;e. Two heralds on each &s;ide of a gentleman on hor&s;eback bearing a banner with the arms of <HI>Vicenza</HI> and <HI>Otranto</HI> quarterly&mdash;a circum&s;tance that much offended <HI>Man|fred</HI>&mdash;but he &s;tifled his re&s;entment. Two more pages. The Knight's confe&s;&s;or telling his beads. Fifty more footmen, clad as before. Two Knights habited in complete armour, their beavers down, comrades to the principal Knight. The &s;quires of the two Knights, car|rying their &s;hields and devices. The Knight's

own &s;quire. An hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous &s;word, and &s;eeming to faint under the weight of it. The Knight him&s;elf on a che&s;tnut &s;teed, in complete armour, his lance in the re&s;t, his face entirely concealed by his vizor, which was &s;urmounted by a large plume of &s;carlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion, which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for the principal Knight.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he approached the gate, he &s;topped; and the herald advancing, read again the words of the challenge. <HI>Manfred</HI>'s eyes were fixed on the gigantic &s;word, and he &s;carce &s;eemed to at|tend to the cartel: But his attention was &s;oon diverted by a tempe&s;t of wind that ro&s;e behind him. He turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the &s;ame extraor|dinary manner as before. It required intrepi|dity like <HI>Manfred</HI>'s not to &s;ink under a concur|rence of circum&s;tances that &s;eemed to announce
<PB N="103" REF="110">
his fate. Yet &s;corning in the pre&s;ence of &s;tran|gers to betray the courage he had always mani|fe&s;ted, he &s;aid boldly, Sir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of mortal mould, thy valour &s;hall meet its equal: And, if thou art a true Knight, thou wilt &s;corn to employ &s;orcery to carry thy point. Be the&s;e omens from heaven or hell, <HI>Manfred</HI> tru&s;ts to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his cau&s;e and to the aid of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who has ever protected his hou&s;e.

<P>The Knight made no reply, but di&s;mounting, was conducted by <HI>Manfred</HI> to the great hall of the ca&s;tle. As they traver&s;ed the court, the Knight &s;topped to gaze at the miraculous ca&s;que; and kneeling down, &s;eemed to pray inwardly for &s;ome minutes. Ri&s;ing, he made a &s;ign to the Prince to lead on. As &s;oon as they entered the hall, <HI>Manfred</HI> propo&s;ed to the &s;tranger to
<PB N="104" REF="111">
di&s;arm, but the Knight &s;hook his head in token of refu&s;al. Sir Knight, &s;aid <HI>Manfred,</HI> this is not courteous; but by my good faith I will not cro&s;s thee; nor &s;halt thou have cau&s;e to com|plain of the Prince of <HI>Otranto.</HI> No treachery is de&s;igned on my part; I hope none is intended on thine: Here take my gage: [giving him his ring] your friends and you &s;hall enjoy the laws of ho&s;pitality. Re&s;t here, until refre&s;hments are brought: I will but give orders for the ac|commodation of your train, and return to you. The three Knights bowed as accepting his cour|te&s;y. <HI>Manfred</HI> directed the &s;tranger's retinue to be conducted to an adjacent ho&s;pital, founded by the Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI> for the reception of pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the gate, the gigantic &s;word bur&s;t from the &s;upporters, and falling to the ground oppo&s;ite to the helmet, remained im|moveable. <HI>Manfred</HI> almo&s;t hardened to preter|natural appearances, &s;urmounted the &s;hock of this new prodigy; and returning to the hall,
<PB N="105" REF="112">
where by this time the fea&s;t was ready, he in|vited his &s;ilent gue&s;ts to take their places. <HI>Man|fred,</HI> however ill his heart was at ea&s;e, endea|voured to in&s;pire the company with mirth. He put &s;everal que&s;tions to them, but was an&s;wered only by &s;igns. They rai&s;ed their vizors but &s;ufficiently to feed them&s;elves, and that &s;par|ingly. Sirs, &s;aid the Prince, ye are the fir&s;t gue&s;ts I ever treated within the&s;e walls, who &s;corned to hold any intercour&s;e with me: Nor has it oft been cu&s;tomary, I ween, for Princes to hazard their &s;tate and dignity again&s;t &s;trangers and mutes. You &s;ay you come in the name of <HI>Frederic</HI> of <HI>Vicenza</HI>: I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight; nor would he, I am bold to &s;ay, think it beneath him to mix in &s;ocial conver&s;e with a Prince that is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in arms.&mdash;Still ye are &s;ilent&mdash;well! be it as it may&mdash;by the laws of ho&s;pitality and chivalry ye are ma&s;ters under this roof; Ye &s;hall do your plea|&s;ures&mdash;but come, give me a goblet of wine;

<P>The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar would di&s;cover to the &s;trangers that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had taken &s;anctuary, was going to forbid <HI>Jerome</HI>'s entrance.

<P><HI>Theodore</HI> went pen&s;ively to the convent, to acquaint his father with his deliverance.

In this mood he roved in&s;en&s;ibly to the caves which had for|merly &s;erved as a retreat to hermits, and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil &s;pirits. He recollected to have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and adventu|rous di&s;po&s;ition, he willingly indulged his cu|rio&s;ity in exploring the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of this la|byrinth.

He thought the place more likely to be infe&s;ted by robbers than by tho&s;e infernal agents who are reported to mole&s;t and bewilder travellers. He

At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, di&s;cour&s;ing with a pea&s;ant, who a&s;&s;ured him he had &s;een a lady enter the pa&s;&s;es of the rock.

Prince&s;s, and giving various orders to prevent her falling into the power of the three Knights. Their chief had &s;u&s;pected <HI>Manfred</HI> of being pri|vy to the Prince&s;s's ab&s;conding; and this in&s;ult from a man, who he concluded was &s;tationed by that Prince to &s;ecrete her, confirming his &s;u&s;picions, he made no reply, but di&s;charging a blow with his &s;abre at <HI>Theodore,</HI> would &s;oon have removed all ob&s;truction, if <HI>Theodore,</HI> who took him for one of <HI>Manfred</HI>'s captains, and who had no &s;ooner given the provocation than prepared to &s;upport it, had not received the &s;troke on his &s;hield. The valour that had &s;o long been &s;mothered in his brea&s;t, broke forth at once; he ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly on the Knight, who&s;e pride and wrath were not le&s;s power|ful incentives to hardy deeds. The combat was furious, but not long: <HI>Theodore</HI> wounded the Knight in three &s;everal places, and at la&s;t di&s;|armed him as he fainted with the lo&s;s of blood. The pea&s;ant, who had fled at the fir&s;t on&s;et, had given the alarm to &s;ome of <HI>Manfred</HI>'s dome&s;|tics,
<PB N="129" REF="136">
who by his orders were di&s;per&s;ed through the fore&s;t in pur&s;uit of <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> They came up as the Knight fell, whom they &s;oon di&s;covered to be the noble &s;tranger. <HI>Theodore,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding his hatred to <HI>Manfred,</HI> could not be|hold the victory he had gained without emo|tions of pity and genero&s;ity: But he was more touched, when he learned the quality of his adver&s;ary, and was informed that he was no retainer, but an enemy of <HI>Manfred.</HI> He a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ervants of the latter in di&s;arming the Knight, and in endeavouring to &s;taunch the blood that flowed from his wounds.

<P>THE &s;orrowful troop no &s;ooner arrived at the ca&s;tle, than they were met by <HI>Hippo|lita</HI> and <HI>Matilda,</HI> whom <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had &s;ent one of the dome&s;tics before to adverti&s;e of their ap|proach.

He in&s;tantly &s;et out for the wood that had been marked in his dream. For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the fore&s;t without &s;eeing a human form: But on the evening of the third they came to a cell, in which they found a ve|nerable hermit in the agonies of death.

The dignity and patient firmne&s;s of <HI>Hippolita</HI> pene|trated him with re&s;pect, and the tender &s;ilent affection with which the Prince&s;s and her daugh|ter regarded each other, melted him almo&s;t to tears.

<PB N="143" REF="150">
which was &s;ituated on the coa&s;t, had, during his ab&s;ence, been laid wa&s;te by the Rover, who had carried my mother and me into captivity: That his ca&s;tle had been burnt to the ground, and that my father on his return had &s;old what remained, and was retired into a religious hou&s;e in the kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> but where no man could inform me. De&s;titute and friendle&s;s, hopele&s;s almo&s;t of attaining the tran&s;port of a parent's embrace, I took the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;etting &s;ail for <HI>Naples,</HI> from whence, within the&s;e &s;ix days, I wandered into this province, &s;till &s;up|porting my&s;elf by the labour of my hands; nor until ye&s;ter-morn did I believe that heaven had re&s;erved any lot for me but peace of mind and contented poverty.

But now, and thou did&s;t offend me: Yet the noble blood which flows in thy vains, may well be allowed to boil out, when it has &s;o recently traced it&s;elf to its &s;ource. Come, my Lord [turning to <HI>Manfred</HI>] if I can pardon him, &s;urely you may: It is not the youth's fault, if you took him for a &s;pectre.

The Prince, not &s;orry to quit a conver&s;ation, which recalled to mind the di&s;covery he had made of his mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;en&s;a|tions, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be conducted to his own apartment, after permitting <HI>Theodore,</HI> tho' under engagement to return to the ca&s;tle on the morrow [a condition the young man gladly ac|cepted] to retire with his father to the convent. <HI>Matilda</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> were too much occupied with their own reflections, and too little con|tent with each other, to wi&s;h for farther con|ver&s;e that night.

<P>If they parted with &s;mall cordiality, they did but meet with greater impatience, as &s;oon as the &s;un was ri&s;en. Their minds were in a &s;ituation that excluded &s;leep, and each recollected a thou|&s;and que&s;tions which &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he had put to

It were better to clear this up&mdash;She wi&s;hed to know the truth, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould wrong her friend by entertaining a pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s lover.

I will go to my dear <HI>Matilda,</HI> who will confirm me in this becoming pride&mdash;man is fal&s;e&mdash;I will advi&s;e with her on taking the veil: She will rejoice to find me in this di&s;po&s;ition: and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppo&s;e her inclination for the cloy&s;ter. In this frame of mind, and determined to open her heart en|tirely to <HI>Matilda,</HI> &s;he went to that Prince&s;s's chamber, whom &s;he found already dre&s;&s;ed, and leaning pen&s;ively on her arm. This attitude, &s;o corre&s;pondent to what &s;he felt her&s;elf, revived <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s &s;u&s;picions, and de&s;troyed the confidence

<P><HI>Hippolita</HI>'s real purpo&s;e was to demand of <HI>Je|rome,</HI> whether in con&s;cience &s;he might not con|&s;ent to the divorce. She had oft urged <HI>Man|fred</HI> to re&s;ign the principality, which the deli|cacy
<PB N="161" REF="168">
of her con&s;cience rendered an hourly bur|then to her. The&s;e &s;cruples concurred to make the &s;eparation from her hu&s;band appear le&s;s dreadful to her, than it would have &s;eemed in any other &s;ituation.</P>
<P><HI>Jerome,</HI> at quitting the ca&s;tle overnight, had que&s;tioned <HI>Theodore</HI> &s;everely why he had accu&s;ed him to <HI>Manfred</HI> of being privy to his e&s;cape. <HI>Theodore</HI> owned it had been with de&s;ign to pre|vent <HI>Manfred</HI>'s &s;u&s;picion from alighting on <HI>Ma|tilda</HI>; and added, the holine&s;s of <HI>Jerome</HI>'s life and character &s;ecured him from the tyrant's wrath. <HI>Jerome</HI> was heartily grieved to di&s;cover his &s;on's inclination for that Prince&s;s; and leav|ing him to his re&s;t; promi&s;ed in the morning to acquaint him with important rea&s;ons for con|quering his pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Theodore,</HI> like <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> was too recently acquainted with parental authority to &s;ubmit to its deci&s;ions again&s;t the impul&s;e of his heart. He had little curio&s;ity to learn the Friar's rea&s;ons, and le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to obey

them. The lovely <HI>Matilda</HI> had made &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ions on him than filial affection. All night he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with vi&s;ions of love; and it was not till late after the morning-office, that he recollected the Friar's commands to at|tend him at <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>'s tomb.</P>
<P>Young man, &s;aid <HI>Jerome,</HI> when he &s;aw him, this tardine&s;s does not plea&s;e me.

It is &s;inful, replied the Friar, to che|ri&s;h tho&s;e whom heaven has doomed to de&s;truc|tion. A tyrant's race mu&s;t be &s;wept from the earth to the third and fourth generation. Will

Join with us, Lady! thy &s;potle&s;s &s;oul may obtain an exemp|tion from the judgments which the portents of the&s;e days but too &s;peakingly denounced again&s;t thy hou&s;e.

<P><HI>Hippolita</HI> then acquainted the Friar with the propo&s;al &s;he had &s;ugge&s;ted to <HI>Manfred,</HI> his ap|probation of it, and the tender of <HI>Matilda</HI> that he was gone to make to <HI>Frederic. Jerome</HI> could not conceal his di&s;like of the motion, which he covered under pretence of the improbability that <HI>Frederic,</HI> the neare&s;t of blood to <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> and who was come to claim his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would yield to an alliance with the u&s;urper of his right. But nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar, when <HI>Hippolita</HI> confe&s;&s;ed her readi|ne&s;s not to oppo&s;e the &s;eparation, and demand|ed his opinion on the legality of her acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173">
The Friar catched eagerly at her reque&s;t of his advice, and without explaining his aver&s;ion to the propo&s;ed marriage of <HI>Manfred</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> he painted to <HI>Hippolita</HI> in the mo&s;t alarming colours the &s;infulne&s;s of her con&s;ent, denounced judgments again&s;t her if &s;he complied, and en|joined her in the &s;evere&s;t terms to treat any &s;uch propo&s;ition with every mark of indignation and refu&s;al.</P>
<P><HI>Manfred,</HI> in the mean time, had broken his purpo&s;e to <HI>Frederic,</HI> and propo&s;ed the double marriage. That weak Prince, who had been &s;truck with the charms of <HI>Matilda,</HI> li&s;tened but too eagerly to the offer. He forgot his enmity to <HI>Manfred,</HI> whom he &s;aw but little hope of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing by force; and flattering him&s;elf that no i&s;&s;ue might &s;ucceed from the union of his daughter with the Tyrant, he looked upon his own &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the principality as facilitated by wedding <HI>Matilda.</HI> He made faint oppo&s;ition to the propo&s;al; affecting, for form only, not
<PB N="167" REF="174">
to acquie&s;ce unle&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI> &s;hould con&s;ent to the divorce. <HI>Manfred</HI> took that upon him&s;elf. Tran&s;ported with his &s;ucce&s;s and impatient to &s;ee him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to expect &s;ons, he ha&s;tened to his wife's apartment, determined to extort her compliance. He learned with indig|nation that &s;he was ab&s;ent at the convent. His guilt &s;ugge&s;ted to him that &s;he had proba|bly been informed by <HI>I&s;abella</HI> of his purpo&s;e. He doubted whether her retirement to the con|vent did not import an intention of remaining there until &s;he could rai&s;e ob&s;tacles to their divorce; and the &s;u&s;picions he had already en|tertained of <HI>Jerome,</HI> made him apprehend that the Friar would not only traver&s;e his views, but might have in&s;pired <HI>Hippolita</HI> with the re&s;olution of taking &s;anctuary. Impatient to unravel this clue, and to defeat its &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>Manfred</HI> ha&s;tened to the convent, and arrived there, as the Friar was earne&s;tly exhorting the prince&s;s never to yield to the divorce.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175">
Madam, &s;aid <HI>Manfred,</HI> what bu&s;ine&s;s drew you hither? why did you not await my return from the Marquis?

<P>EVERY reflection which <HI>Manfred</HI> made on the Friar's behaviour, con&s;pired to per&s;uade

him that <HI>Jerome</HI> was privy to an amour between <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and <HI>Theodore.</HI> But <HI>Jerome</HI>'s new pre|&s;umption, &s;o di&s;&s;onant from his former meek|ne&s;s, &s;ugge&s;ted &s;till deeper apprehen&s;ions. The Prince even &s;u&s;pected that the Friar depended on &s;ome &s;ecret &s;upport from <HI>Frederic,</HI> who&s;e ar|rival coinciding with the novel appearance of <HI>Theodore</HI> &s;eemed to be&s;peak a corre&s;pondence. Still more was he troubled with the re&s;emblance of <HI>Theodore</HI> to <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>'s portrait. The latter he knew had unque&s;tionably died without i&s;&s;ue. <HI>Frederic</HI> had con&s;ented to be&s;tow <HI>I&s;abella</HI> on him. The&s;e contradictions agitated his mind with numberle&s;s pangs. He &s;aw but two methods of extricating him&s;elf from his difficulties. The one was to re&s;ign his dominions to the marquis&mdash;Pride, ambition, and his reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a po&s;|&s;ibility of his pre&s;erving them to his po&s;terity combated that thought. The other was to
<PB N="182" REF="181">
pre&s;s his marriage with <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> After long ru|minating on the&s;e anxious thoughts, as he marched &s;ilently with <HI>Hippolita</HI> to the ca&s;tle, he at la&s;t di&s;cour&s;ed with that prince&s;s on the &s;ub|ject of his di&s;quiet, and u&s;ed every in&s;inuating and plau&s;ible argument to extract her con&s;ent to, even her promi&s;e of promoting the divorce. <HI>Hippolita</HI> needed little per&s;ua&s;ion to bend her to his plea&s;ure. She endeavoured to win him over to the mea&s;ure of re&s;igning his dominions; but finding her exhortations fruitle&s;s, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that as far as her con&s;cience would allow, &s;he would rai&s;e no oppo&s;ition to a &s;eparation, though without better founded &s;cruples than what he yet alledged, &s;he would not engage to be active in demanding it.</P>
<P>This compliance, though inadequate, was &s;ufficient to rai&s;e <HI>Manfred</HI>'s hopes. He tru&s;ted that his power and wealth would ea&s;ily advance his &s;uit at the court of <HI>Rome,</HI> whither he re&s;olv|ed to engage <HI>Frederic</HI> to take a journey on pur|po&s;e.
<PB N="183" REF="182">
That prince had di&s;covered &s;o much pa&s;|&s;ion for <HI>Matilda,</HI> that <HI>Manfred</HI> hoped to obtain all he wi&s;hed by holding out or withdrawing his daughter's charms, according as the Marquis &s;hould appear more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to co-operate in his views. Even the ab&s;ence of <HI>Frederic</HI> would be a material point gained, until he could take farther mea&s;ures for his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing <HI>Hippolita</HI> to her apartment, he re|paired to that of the Marquis; but cro&s;&s;ing the great hall through which he was to pa&s;s, he met <HI>Bianca.</HI> That dam&s;el he knew was in the confidence of both the young Ladies.

<P><HI>Manfred</HI> alarmed at the re&s;olute tone in which <HI>Frederic</HI> delivered the&s;e words, endeavoured to pacify him. Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing <HI>Bianca,</HI> he made &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Marquis, and threw in &s;uch artful encomiums on <HI>Matilda,</HI> that <HI>Frederic</HI> was once more &s;taggered. However, as his pa&s;&s;ion was of &s;o recent a date, it could not at once &s;urmount the &s;cruples he had conceived. He had gathered enough from <HI>Bianca</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e to per&s;uade him that heaven declared it&s;elf again&s;t <HI>Manfred.</HI> The propo&s;ed marriages too removed his claim to a di&s;tance; and the principality of <HI>Otranto</HI> was a &s;tronger temptation, than the contingent rever&s;ion of it with <HI>Matilda.</HI> Still he would not ad&s;olutely recede from his engage|ments; but purpo&s;ing to gain time, he demand|ed of <HI>Manfred,</HI> if it was true in fact that <HI>Hip|polita</HI> con&s;ented to the divorce. The Prince, tran&s;ported to find no other ob&s;tacle, and de|pending
<PB N="194" REF="193">
on his influence over his wife, a&s;&s;ured the Marquis it was &s;o, and that he might &s;a|tisfy him&s;elf of the truth from her own mouth.</P>
<P>As they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing, word was brought that the banquet was prepared. <HI>Man|fred</HI> conducted <HI>Frederic</HI> to the great hall, where they were received by <HI>Hippolita</HI> and the young Prince&s;&s;es. <HI>Manfred</HI> placed the Marquis next to <HI>Matilda,</HI> and &s;eated him&s;elf between his wife and <HI>I&s;abella. Hippolita</HI> comported her&s;elf with an ea&s;y gravity; but the young Ladies were &s;ilent and melancholy. <HI>Manfred,</HI> who was determin|ed to pur&s;ue his point with the Marquis in the remainder of the evening, pu&s;hed on the fea&s;t until it waxed late; affecting unre&s;trained gaiety, and plying <HI>Frederic</HI> with repeated goblets of wine. The latter, more upon his guard than <HI>Manfred</HI> wi&s;hed, declined his frequent chal|lenges, on pretence of his late lo&s;s of blood; while the Prince, to rai&s;e his own di&s;ordered &s;pirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged
<PB N="195" REF="194">
him&s;elf in plentiful draughts, though not to the intoxication of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded. <HI>Manfred</HI> would have withdrawn with <HI>Frederic</HI>; but the latter pleading weak|ne&s;s and want of repo&s;e, retired to his cham|ber, galantly telling the Prince, that his daugh|ter &s;hould amu&s;e his Highne&s;s until him&s;elf could attend him. <HI>Manfred</HI> accepted the party, and to the no &s;mall grief of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> accompanied her to her apartment. <HI>Matilda</HI> waited on her mother to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of the evening on the ramparts of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Soon as the company were di&s;per&s;ed their &s;everal ways, <HI>Frederic,</HI> quitting his chamber, enquired if <HI>Hippolita</HI> was alone, and was told by one of her attendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at that hour &s;he gene|rally withdrew to her oratory, where he pro|bably would find her. The Marquis during
<PB N="196" REF="195">
the repa&s;t had beheld <HI>Matilda</HI> with increa&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion. He now wi&s;hed to find <HI>Hippolita</HI> in the di&s;po&s;ition her Lord had promi&s;ed. The portents that had alarmed him, were forgotten in his de&s;ires. Stealing &s;oftly and unob&s;erved to the apartment of <HI>Hippolita,</HI> he entered it with a re&s;olution to encourage her acquie&s;cence to the divorce, having perceived that <HI>Manfred</HI> was re&s;olved to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> an unalterable condition, before he would grant <HI>Matilda</HI> to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Marquis was not &s;urprized at the &s;ilence that reigned in the Prince&s;s's apartment. Con|cluding her, as he had been advertized, in her oratory, he pa&s;&s;ed on. The door was a|jar; the evening gloomy and overca&s;t. Pu&s;h|ing open the door gently, he &s;aw a per&s;on kneeling before the alter. As he approached nearer, it &s;eemed not a woman, but one in a long woollen weed, who&s;e back was towards him. The per&s;on &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in prayer.
<PB N="197" REF="196">
The Marquis was about to return, when the figure ri&s;ing, &s;tood &s;ome moments fixed in meditation, without regarding him. The Mar|quis, expecting the holy per&s;on to come forth, and meaning to excu&s;e his uncivil interruption, &s;aid, reverend Father, I &s;ought the Lady <HI>Hip|polita</HI>&mdash;<HI>Hippolita</HI>! replied a hollow voice? came&s;t thou to this ca&s;tle to &s;eek <HI>Hippolita</HI>?&mdash;and then the figure, turning &s;lowly round, di&s;|covered to <HI>Frederic</HI> the fle&s;hle&s;s jaws and empty &s;ockets of a &s;keleton, wrapt in a hermit's cowl. Angels of grace, protect me! cried <HI>Frederic</HI> re|coiling. De&s;erve their protection! &s;aid the Spectre. <HI>Frederic</HI> falling on his knees, adjured the Phantom to take pity on him. Do&s;t thou not remember me? &s;aid the apparition. Remember the wood of <HI>Joppa</HI>! Art thou that holy Her|mit? cried <HI>Frederic</HI> trembling&mdash;can I do aught for thy eternal peace?&mdash;Wa&s;t thou delivered from bondage, &s;aid the &s;pectre, to pur&s;ue carnal delights? Ha&s;t thou forgotten the buried &s;abre, and the behe&s;t of Heaven en|graven

<P><HI>Frederic</HI>'s blood froze in his veins. For &s;ome minutes he remained motionle&s;s. Then falling pro&s;trate on his face before the alter, he be|&s;ought the interce&s;&s;ion of every &s;aint for pardon. A flood of tears &s;ucceeded to this tran&s;port; and the image of the beauteous <HI>Matilda</HI> ru&s;hing in &s;pite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and pa&s;&s;ion. Ere he could recover from this agony of his &s;pirits, the Prince&s;s <HI>Hippolita</HI> with a taper in her hand entered the oratory alone. Seeing a man without motion on the floor, &s;he gave a &s;hriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought <HI>Frederic</HI> to him&s;elf. Ri&s;ing &s;uddenly, his face bedewed with tears, he would have ru&s;hed from her pre&s;ence; but <HI>Hippolita</HI> &s;topping him, con|jured
<PB N="199" REF="198">
him in the mo&s;t plaintive accents to ex|plain the cau&s;e of his di&s;order, and by what &s;trange chance &s;he had found him there in that po&s;ture. Ah! virtuous Prince&s;s! &s;aid the Mar|quis, penetrated with grief&mdash;and &s;topped. For the love of Heaven, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Hippolita,</HI> di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e of this tran&s;port! what mean the&s;e doleful &s;ounds, this alarming exclama|tion on my name?

<P>Quitting the Prince&s;s thus abruptly, he ha|&s;tened to his own apartment. At the door of it he was acco&s;ted by <HI>Manfred,</HI> who flu&s;hed by
<PB N="200" REF="199">
wine and love had come to &s;eek him, and to propo&s;e to wa&s;te &s;ome hours of the night in mu&s;ic and revelling. <HI>Frederic,</HI> offended at an invita|tion &s;o di&s;&s;onant from the mood of his &s;oul, pu&s;hed him rudely a&s;ide, and entering his cham|ber, flung the door intemperately again&s;t <HI>Man|fred,</HI> and bolted it inwards. The haughty Prince, enraged at this unaccountable behavi|our, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the mo&s;t fatal exce&s;&s;es. As he cro&s;&s;ed the court, he was met by the dome&s;tic whom he had planted at the convent as a &s;py on <HI>Jerome</HI> and <HI>Theodore.</HI> This man, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with the ha&s;te he had made, informed his Lord, that <HI>Theodore</HI> and &s;ome lady from the ca&s;tle were at that in&s;tant in private conference at the tomb of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> in St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s church.

He da&s;hed him&s;elf on the ground, and cur&s;ed the day he was born. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> apprehen&s;ive that the&s;e &s;truggles of pa&s;&s;ion were more than <HI>Matilda</HI> could &s;upport, took upon her&s;elf to order <HI>Man|fred</HI> to be borne to his apartment, while &s;he cau&s;ed <HI>Matilda</HI> to be conveyed to the neare&s;t chamber. <HI>Hippolita,</HI> &s;carce more alive than her daughter, was regardle&s;s of every thing but her: but when the tender <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s care would have

Her &s;inking pul&s;e and the damp cold|ne&s;s of her hand &s;oon di&s;pelled all hopes of reco|very. <HI>Theodore</HI> followed the &s;urgeons into the outer chamber and heard them pronounce the fatal &s;entence with a tran&s;port equal to frenzy&mdash;Since &s;he cannot live mine, cried he, at lea&s;t &s;he &s;hall be mine in death!&mdash;Father! <HI>Jerome</HI>! will you not join our hands? cried he to the Friar, who with the marquis had accompanied the &s;ur|geons What means thy di&s;tracted ra&s;hne&s;s? &s;aid <HI>Jerome</HI>; is this an hour for marriage!

This reverend man, my father, has informed me who I am.

<P><HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in the mean time, was accompany|ing the afflicted <HI>Hippolita</HI> to her apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by <HI>Manfred,</HI> who, di&s;tracted with his own thoughts, and anxious once more to behold his daughter, was advancing to the chamber where &s;he lay. As the moon was now at its height, he read in the countenance of this unhappy company the event he dreaded.

latter, forcing <HI>Theodore</HI> along with them, ru&s;hed into the court. The moment <HI>Theodore</HI> appeared, the walls of the ca&s;tle behind <HI>Manfred</HI> were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of <HI>Alfon&s;o,</HI> dilated to an immen&s;e magni|tude, appeared in the centre of the ruins. Be|hold in <HI>Theodore</HI> the true heir of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>! &s;aid the vi&s;ion: And having pronounced tho&s;e words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it a&s;cended &s;olemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting a&s;under, the form of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> was &s;een, and receiving <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI>'s &s;hade, they were &s;oon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.</P>
<P>The beholders fell pro&s;trate on their faces, acknowledging the divine will.

<P>What remains, is my part to declare, &s;aid <HI>Jerome.</HI> When <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> &s;et &s;ail for the holy land, he was driven by a &s;torm to the coa&s;t of <HI>Sicily.</HI> The other ve&s;&s;el, which bore <HI>Ricardo</HI> and his train, as your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> mu&s;t have heard, was &s;eparated from him.

For three months Lord <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> was wind-bound in <HI>Sicily.</HI> There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named <HI>Victoria.</HI> He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden plea&s;ures. They were married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of arms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their nuptials, until his return from the Cru&s;ado, when he purpo&s;ed to &s;eek and acknowledge her for his lawful wife.

He left her pregnant. During his ab&s;ence &s;he was delivered of a daughter: But &s;carce had &s;he felt a mother's pangs, ere &s;he heard the fatal rumour of her Lord's death, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Ricardo.</HI> What could a friendle&s;s, helple&s;s woman do? would her te&s;timony avail?&mdash;yet, my Lord, I have an authentic writing&mdash;it needs not, &s;aid <HI>Manfred</HI>; the horrors of the&s;e days, the vi&s;ion we have but now &s;een, all cor|roborate thy evidence beyond a thou&s;and parch|ments. <HI>Matilda</HI>'s death and my expul&s;ion&mdash;Be compo&s;ed, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Hippolita</HI>; this holy man did not mean to recal your griefs. <HI>Jerome</HI> proceeded.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell on what is needle&s;s. The daughter of which <HI>Victoria</HI> was delivered, was at her maturity be&s;towed in marriage on me. <HI>Victoria</HI> died; and the &s;ecret remained locked in my brea&s;t. <HI>Theodore</HI>'s narrative has told the re&s;t.</P>
