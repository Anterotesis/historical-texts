<HEAD>A LETTER TO A Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Can't but think the conver&s;ation we late|ly had with &s;ome friends about the di&s;|&s;enting intere&s;t might be very u&s;eful, if made more publick, becau&s;e tho' every one is &s;en&s;ible it gradually declines, yet no one has endeavour'd to recover it, tho' a great part of that company thought it not difficult to effect. I believe this is owing to our di&s;agreement as to the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of its de|cay, and unle&s;s the cau&s;es are found out a remedy cannot po&s;&s;ibly be apply'd, but it mu&s;t continue con&s;uming 'till it is quite worn out and &s;pent. You may remember there were many rea&s;ons hereof a&s;&s;ign'd at that time, &s;ome of which appear to have but very little, if any, pretence to it. Such as the lenity of the government, the want of a per&s;ecution to keep us together, the lo&s;s of a <HI>puritanical</HI> &s;pirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As to the fir&s;t, I can't think it to
<PB N="4" REF="3">
be any cau&s;e, for men are rather apt per|ver&s;ely to abu&s;e the lenity of the govern|ment, and to go in direct oppo&s;ition to it, and tho&s;e who can &s;uffer <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> for the truth, would certainly act con&s;i&s;tently with it at other times; but if it be indeed the rea&s;on, then the in|tere&s;t is not worth &s;upporting, becau&s;e 'twould be founded upon mere ob&s;tinacy, and proceed from a &s;pirit of contradiction. The la&s;t cannot be the cau&s;e, ina&s;much as the true puritanical &s;pirit is not lo&s;t, but rather carry'd farther and improv'd. The &s;pirit of the good old Puritans was nothing el&s;e but a &s;pirit of <HI>liberty</HI>; and con&s;idering what they &s;uffer'd in the defence of it, they cannot but be thought as much &s;uperiour to the Patrons of civil liberty, as civil liberty is inferiour to re|ligious. Indeed &s;ome of them had a few <HI>oddities</HI> mix'd with this generous &s;entiment, which it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd were ridicu|lous enough; and the&s;e have been improv'd by witty and &s;arca&s;tical men to the prejudice of their &s;entiments. But their &s;ucce&s;&s;ours have by degrees thrown them off, and &s;till continue to do &s;o, 'till 'tis to be hop'd they will in time entirely vani&s;h, that &s;o their true &s;pirit, ab&s;tracted therefrom, may appear in its own colours, bright and lively, and be valu'd as the alone principle, not only of di&s;|&s;enting, but even of truth and religion them|&s;elves. So that I think the grand cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent decay of the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t are
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>ignorance</HI> of their own principles, and <HI>ill con|duct</HI> and management of their own intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e mu&s;t be one cau&s;e, for when they are rightly under&s;tood they are unan&s;werable. They are only tho&s;e of the <HI>reformation</HI> carry'd farther than in the Church of <HI>England</HI>; and 'tis &s;urprizing how any who pretend to be <HI>reform'd</HI> can entertain that enmity to them, which has always been more or le&s;s &s;trong in tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <HI>Tories.</HI> But e&s;pecially I'm &s;urpriz'd at tho&s;e who have wrote in <HI>other</HI> ca&s;es upon the &s;ame principles. How then comes it to pa&s;s we &s;hould be branded as up&s;tarts? for our principles are not new, but eternally true and &s;acred; or that any who have ever heard of them &s;hould be a&s;ham'd of, or renounce them? So that I am per&s;uaded tho&s;e who leave us either have never thoroughly learnt them, or el&s;e their circum&s;tances are &s;o unhappy that, either from the perver&s;ene&s;s of tho&s;e they have to do with, or el&s;e from their own private affairs, they cannot act con&s;i&s;tently with them.</P>
<P>Therefore for the benefit of tho&s;e who have been bred in ignorance, or in&s;tructed in fal&s;e principles, I think, Sir, 'twould be very proper to acquaint the world what our <HI>true</HI> &s;entiments are, and to di&s;claim tho&s;e which are prejudicial to truth, and introductive of bigotry and enthu&s;ia&s;m; for &s;uch are not on|ly fal&s;e but vicious. And yet how many di&s;|&s;enters are there who have run into them,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and thereby driven others from us who &s;ee their ab&s;urdity, if they do not examine whe|ther we have any thing more &s;olid, and con|vincing to &s;ay for our&s;elves. I never yet met with any who could with&s;tand the force of them, when they were rightly explain'd; and even tho&s;e who are led to approve the cere|monies of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as proper e|nough in a <HI>political</HI> view, yet can never vin|dicate them when objected again&s;t upon the foot of liberty.</P>
<P>The fundamental principle of the di&s;&s;en|ters is, as I apprehend, a <HI>liberty</HI> for every man to form his own &s;entiments, and to pur&s;ue them by all lawful and regular methods; to di&s;claim the <HI>impo&s;itions</HI> of men, and to wor|&s;hip God according to the dictates of his own con&s;cience. It &s;uppo&s;es that God has given to all men capacities of under&s;tanding their obligations to him; and therefore as eve|ry man is accountable to God for his actions, he is under the &s;tricte&s;t obligations to act ac|cording to <HI>his own</HI> knowledge, and whenever he does not, he is guilty of a voluntary vi|olation of truth. It &s;uppo&s;es the &s;criptures to be a &s;ufficient rule of the conduct of men, as well in religious as in &s;ecular affairs, and that no one has a right to enjoin things as <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to church-communion which are not enjoin'd in the &s;criptures; and that the arguments from <HI>antiquity</HI> and the practice of the <HI>primitive church</HI> are not a &s;acred
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and infallible rule for our practice, becau&s;e then they would not have been left to the di&s;cretion even of the Antients them&s;elves, but been mention'd by the Apo&s;tles, who only were in&s;pir'd; and however we may follow any of their cu&s;toms as fit and proper enough, yet we are not to pay them any particular re|verence, or to acknowledge a <HI>divine right</HI> in them. That as the circum&s;tances of churches, or private &s;ocieties vary, &s;o their method of wor&s;hip and communion mu&s;t likewi&s;e vary; and however it may be proper for them to agree upon certain cu&s;toms and ceremonies among&s;t them&s;elves, yet they mu&s;t not be con&s;ider'd as binding the con&s;cience; and therefore 'tis proper &s;ometimes to alter them, le&s;t cu&s;tom &s;hould &s;eem to bear the &s;tamp of au|thority. It &s;uppo&s;es that the Church of Chri&s;t is not <HI>national</HI> but private, and &s;ince neither our Saviour, nor his Apo&s;tles have laid down any rules for the government of the churches, no particular rules were de|&s;ign'd for all churches in every particular place, but were left to the di&s;cretion of eve|ry one, according as they appear'd be&s;t &s;uited to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of religious wor&s;hip therein. This is the rea&s;on why we differ among&s;t our&s;elves, tho' that has been object|ed again&s;t us, becau&s;e we have all an equal right to judge for our&s;elves, and one church has the &s;ame liberty of making <HI>di&s;cretionary rules</HI> as another. This &s;eems ab&s;olutely in|con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="8" REF="7">
with any national e&s;tabli&s;hment and impo&s;ition, and the &s;ame rea&s;ons that induce us to di&s;&s;ent in <HI>England</HI> would lead us to the &s;ame in <HI>Rome,</HI> or at <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>This is the general opinion of the di&s;&s;en|ters, &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable in all places, and at all times; I mean of tho&s;e who under&s;tand them&s;elves. It mu&s;t be allow'd there are many who di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, not upon this principle, but be|cau&s;e they think their own method of wor|&s;hip to be the only &s;criptural method, and plead as &s;trictly, and with as much bigotry for it, as the highe&s;t in the Church of <HI>England</HI> do for the <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy. But the&s;e I &s;hall reject afterwards, and &s;hew not only their tendency to de&s;troy the di&s;&s;enting in|tere&s;t, but the nece&s;&s;ity of our di&s;&s;enting as entirely from them as from the e&s;tabli&s;hment. I am now, Sir, only &s;peaking of tho&s;e who are in the &s;ame generous free &s;entiments with your&s;elf, and who have long renounced all bi|gotry and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>And if tho&s;e which I have mention'd be our genuine opinions, let us con&s;ider how nece&s;&s;arily they oblige us to decline the com|munion of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, both as to the <HI>clergy</HI> and the <HI>laity,</HI> for there are great, tho' not equal hard&s;hips that are impos'd upon each.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>clergy,</HI> their hard&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts, not only in &s;ubmitting to all the forms and
<PB N="9" REF="8">
ceremonies, which the laity mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;ubmit to, and which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can always approve of; but they are likewi&s;e oblig'd to &s;ub&s;cribe in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner that they <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> to the truth of every tittle contain'd in the book of common prayer and the homilies, and that they <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to the u&s;e of them upon all the times therein mention'd; as likewi&s;e to the truth of thirty nine articles drawn up in the time of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth, for the avoiding diver&s;ities, of opinions, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hing con&s;ent touching true religion.</HI> I will not now di&s;pute the truth of any of the&s;e articles, but only &s;ay in the general that there are many of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI> that cannot believe &s;ome of them to be true in any &s;en&s;e whatever; and there are others the whole current of who&s;e opinions run contrary to them. 'Tis well known the generality of the Divines of the Church are in the opinions commonly call'd <HI>Arminian,</HI> and that the&s;e articles are compil'd in a <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> &s;train, and are not true in any <HI>Arminian</HI> &s;en&s;e whatever; and therefore we find that &s;ome who at their fir&s;t promotion could &s;ub&s;cribe to them, as literally true, have yet afterwards, upon a change of &s;entiment, declin'd preferment, ra|ther than make a declaration &s;o contrary to their con&s;ciences; for, you know, they are oblig'd to &s;ub&s;cribe to them upon every new preferment.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
Now what an infinite hard&s;hip is this! and what a &s;hrewd temptation either to per|jure them&s;elves, or leave the church and turn di&s;&s;enters? and, which of the two is more preferable, let even the mo&s;t virulent advocates for the e&s;tabli&s;hment determine.</P>
<P>There are but two arguments for this &s;ub|&s;cription, or rather excu&s;es for it, for mo&s;t of the arguments for impo&s;itions are only excu&s;es for them; and they are, either that they may be &s;ub&s;crib'd in any <HI>&s;criptural &s;en&s;e,</HI> or el&s;e they <HI>now</HI> mean ju&s;t nothing at all, and are only pre&s;erv'd as an old ceremony in the church, to prevent innovations. This you know, Sir, has often been &s;aid, and Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> has endeavour'd, in his preface to the articles, to &s;how that, tho' they mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ented to, yet they may be taken in <HI>any</HI> &s;en&s;e the &s;ub&s;criber can put upon them to make them literally true; and quotes a royal declaration in King <HI>James</HI> I's time, that <HI>no man thereafter &s;hall put his own &s;en&s;e or comment to be the meaning of the articles, but &s;hall take them in the literal and grammatical &s;en&s;e</HI>; and thence infers that per&s;ons on both &s;ides of a que&s;tion may &s;ub&s;cribe them. And there are many of the Bi&s;hops who, at ordi|nations, will not hear the &s;en&s;es they are ta|ken in, but only require the candidates to &s;atisfy them&s;elves. The&s;e are the &s;hifts that are made to vindicate a thing of the wor&s;t con&s;equences imaginable. Moreover as to
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the u&s;e of &s;ome of the ceremonies which are not only un&s;criptural but ab&s;urd, and which they have <HI>con&s;ented</HI> to the u&s;e of, if the Dig|nitary cannot comply with them him&s;elf, 'tis, &s;ome of them think, only to keep a Curate in &s;uch low circum&s;tances that he mu&s;t be forced to it. Thus how many of the &s;upe|riour clergy never read the common prayer, and e&s;pecially the creed of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>? Now this being the ca&s;e what abundant rea&s;on have all your brethren for their di&s;&s;enting? and how great an in&s;tance of virtue is it to move in a lower &s;phere of life, and &s;ubmit to many inconveniences that are put upon them, for the &s;ake of their con&s;ciences and a regard to truth? for it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that many of them, if they could comply with the impo&s;itions of the church, would be en|titled, by their learning and piety, to con&s;i|derable preferments, and &s;uch con&s;iderable preferments have &s;ometimes been laid as baits to draw them into it.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee how unrea&s;onable this &s;ub|&s;cription is in either of the two views that have been mention'd, and then how right it is to di&s;&s;ent, and how much more inconve|nient it would be to the con&s;cience to com|ply with them, than 'tis to their worldly cir|cum&s;tances to avoid them. You know, Sir, there are many who think the very word <HI>con&s;cience</HI> implies &s;omething &s;uper&s;titious and enthu&s;ia&s;tical; but &s;ince we pretend to di&s;&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="11">
only upon a rational account, we mu&s;t let the&s;e gentlemen know that we mean by <HI>con|&s;cience</HI> nothing el&s;e but rea&s;on, honour, inte|grity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that 'tis the rule whereby we judge of the lawfulne&s;s or unlawfulne&s;s of our actions, and the principle that tells us whe|ther we do right or wrong.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, that they may be &s;ub&s;crib'd to in any &s;criptural &s;en&s;e; this cannot an&s;wer their end, which is to prevent <HI>diver&s;ities of opinions,</HI> becau&s;e then 'tis no more than an a&s;&s;ent to the truth of &s;uch particular pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; and how ab&s;urd is it to give an explanation of &s;cripture, for &s;o 'twas originally intended, which mu&s;t afterwards be explain'd by the &s;cripture. This is to explain or prove a thing by it&s;elf, which is both needle&s;s and tedious, becau&s;e an a&s;&s;ent to the one is an a&s;&s;ent to the o|ther. But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome of them would ad|mit of no &s;criptural &s;en&s;e at all, as, if I was a Clergy-man and call'd upon to &s;ub&s;cribe, would be the ca&s;e with me, then I mu&s;t either in a manner perjure my&s;elf, or el&s;e be debarr'd of that &s;ervice to men's be&s;t intere&s;ts which I might think my&s;elf capable of. I do not &s;ay there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be any &s;criptural &s;en&s;e put on the articles upon any &s;cheme of chri&s;tians, but then this mu&s;t effectually ex|clude innumerable of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t learned of the clergy; for when they are &s;ub|&s;crib'd in a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, it mu&s;t mean not according to the <HI>letter</HI> but the interpretation
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of &s;cripture, and let any, but the mo&s;t rigid <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> thus &s;ub&s;cribe them, if they can. But if by &s;ub&s;cribing them in a &s;criptural &s;en&s;e be meant bringing them to &s;uit with a|ny <HI>words</HI> of &s;cripture, then what is it we may not &s;ub&s;cribe to? that God is corporeal, becau&s;e we read of his eyes, hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or to the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, for our Sa|viour has literally &s;aid this <HI>is</HI> my body. I could by this rule receive any preferments in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> if the condition was that I would &s;ub&s;cribe to this doctrine, tho'I meant according to the prote&s;tant interpreta|tion of that pa&s;&s;age, <HI>this is my body,</HI> that is, this is the re&s;emblance of my body. But what would our Bi&s;hops &s;ay, if a Pre&s;byterian was to do this at <HI>Rome</HI>? 'Tis plain this was not the view of the compilers, and I believe no one ever thought it was; all then that can be &s;aid for it is, that 'tis the view of the pre&s;ent government who now impo&s;e them. But where has the government made this de|claration? The requirement of this &s;ub&s;crip|tion is to be con&s;ider'd as an act of parlia|ment, which is in full force, 'till 'tis abro|gated or explained; but neither of the&s;e have been done. The private declarations in con|ver&s;ation of any who are concern'd in the government cannot alter the de&s;ign of them, any more than the di&s;like of any one mem|ber of parliament to an old &s;tatute can repeal it, without a publick a&s;&s;ent of the <HI>whole</HI> le|gi&s;lature.
<PB N="14" REF="13">
So that the way of &s;ub&s;cribing them in any private or particular &s;en&s;e will not do; but they are to be con&s;ider'd in the original &s;en&s;e of the compilers, or el&s;e they <HI>now</HI> mean ju&s;t nothing, but are only an old ceremony pre&s;erv'd in the church, to pre|vent innovations.</P>
<P>But is this hone&s;t, or is it not a very near approach to perjury? Do the ceremonies and &s;olemnity of the &s;ub&s;cription &s;ignify nothing? Are they a mere farce? Can they &s;atisfy them|&s;elves with &s;o &s;olemn a mockery both of God and man? certainly they have little rea|&s;on to expect to <HI>receive the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> after they have thus publickly <HI>ly'd</HI> to him. I know not how 'tis po&s;&s;ible a man can do this with an upright mind, either with regard to the thing it&s;elf, or to the very evil con&s;e|quences of it upon all truth and common morality. The thing it&s;elf cannot be vindi|cated from a crime almo&s;t as bad as perjury, and the con&s;equence is to &s;et an example of it to the laity. With what face can a man di&s;&s;uade them from trifling with &s;erious things, when he has done it &s;o egregiou&s;ly him&s;elf? What is become of ju&s;tice, truth, and fidelity, if this be allow'd? What is it a man may not &s;ay, or &s;wear to, for valuable con&s;iderations? Where is that &s;trict adherence to truth which is not only inculcated in the chri&s;tian revelation, but is a principle of na|ture? Why might not the primitive chri&s;tians
<PB N="15" REF="14">
have &s;acrific'd to idols, deny'd their Ma&s;ter, and &s;o avoided per&s;ecution, &s;ince they meant nothing more by it than an outward ceremo|ny which in the &s;ight of God meant nothing at all? How is it po&s;&s;ible a man can ever &s;uffer for truth, and be a martyr in its cau&s;e?&mdash;But, &s;uch Sir, are you and your bre|thren, &s;ince you are often ridicul'd and con|temn'd, &s;ometimes abandon'd to mi&s;ery and want, for not doing that which in <HI>civil</HI> ca&s;es the pillory would puni&s;h! What an infinite plea&s;ure is the &s;atisfaction of your own minds, beyond the thou&s;ands which a contrary prac|tice might procure!</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this &s;ub&s;cription is ab|&s;urd, becau&s;e it ab&s;olutely prevents all &s;earches and enquiries after truth, and only tends to &s;hackle the mind, or to betray it into vice. It does not keep any out of the church but men of hone&s;ty and integrity; for tho&s;e ei|ther of no principles, or of very un&s;table ones, will not &s;cruple it, and then it does not <HI>avoid diver&s;ities of opinions,</HI> but encourages the very wor&s;t of all opinions, that a man may &s;ub&s;cribe any thing for a <HI>living.</HI> Why then is it not entirely laid a&s;ide, &s;ince an|&s;wers no one valuable purpo&s;e, but it may have the wor&s;t con&s;equences imaginable? Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> has declar'd this &s;ub&s;cription cannot lawfully be made, as to <HI>articles of peace.</HI> And indeed how can an hone&s;t man be at peace, while the world is in an error that he
<PB N="16" REF="15">
can correct. If he can, he may &s;ub&s;cribe to <HI>Mahometani&s;m</HI> in <HI>Turky,</HI> that is, &s;ince 'tis the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd religion</HI> there, he will not di&s;pute again&s;t it; and &s;o 'tis impo&s;&s;ible a fal&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment can ever be laid a&s;ide, and truth introduc'd.</P>
<P>If the&s;e be the con&s;equences of &s;ub|&s;cription in all views, why does not the go|vernment either take it away, or el&s;e publick|ly explain what is <HI>now</HI> meant by it, that &s;o there may be no temptation to that which hone&s;t minds ought not to do, and generous ones cannot. Can men con&s;ent to the u&s;e of the common prayer, who think &s;ome things in it to be &s;o ab&s;urd, that 'tis an af|front to the Divine Being to offer it to him? How many are there who think <HI>Athana|&s;ius</HI>'s creed to be the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent jargon that ever was invented, and yet 'tis read, at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn manner, <HI>as the catholick faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be &s;aved.</HI> I know there are many &s;hifts made u&s;e of to ex|cu&s;e this, as that tho&s;e, who do not believe it them&s;elves, repeat it not as their own faith, but only as the faith of <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> and the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But how then are the <HI>people</HI> of <HI>England</HI> taught? why, to believe that a great part of the clergy will be damn'd, &s;ince there are a great part of them that do not believe it. And thus a man who either re&s;olves to &s;earch into reli|gion

for him&s;elf, which every good chri&s;ti|an and hone&s;t man ought to do, mu&s;t either abide out of the church, or el&s;e play the hypocrite in it. For if he teaches the people his own opinions in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the church, he has <HI>manife&s;tly</HI> &s;ub|&s;crib'd to what he did not believe; if he does not, he is in&s;trumental in keeping them in ignorance. But I &s;hall &s;ay no more on this head, becau&s;e I know, Sir, you have read and ju&s;tly approv'd a pamphlet entitled, <HI>The Difficulties and Di&s;couragements which attend the Study of the Scriptures in the Way of pri|vate Judgment, repre&s;ented in a Letter to a young Clergyman,</HI> &s;aid to be written by a Gen|tleman who is &s;ince advanced to a bi&s;hoprick. This I wi&s;h the people would univer&s;ally read, becau&s;e it has a &s;trength and convic|tion of argument that no con&s;iderations what&s;oever &s;hould overcome; and 'tis to be hop'd this Reverend Prelate will <HI>now</HI> do his endeavour to take the&s;e di&s;couragements a|way, which the title-page &s;ays was his de&s;ign in writing it.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, you know are the hard&s;hips that lie upon the clergy, and keep you and your brethren out of the church; yet, I think, are not peculiar to the clergy, but lie pretty heavy upon the laity too. For it &s;eems to be principally out of regard to them, that the&s;e impo&s;itions are pre&s;erv'd, becau&s;e they cannot bear any alterations in that
<PB N="18" REF="17">
which they have been accu&s;tom'd to think &s;a|cred. I have met with many of the lower &s;ort, who e&s;teem the common prayer to be of e|qual authority with the &s;criptures them&s;elves: and this renders it very improper to bind them up together, as is too common, and I think no &s;mall affront to the <HI>holy Bible.</HI> Now per&s;ons of better &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to the&s;e things, for the &s;ake of vulgar prejudices. Thus who could be grave to hear Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> chaunting out the P&s;alms of <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins</HI>? when Dr. <HI>Watt</HI>'s, which have all the charms of poetry in them, cannot be &s;ung in a church without publick authority.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, there are many excel|lent things in the common prayer; &s;ome of the ceremonies are very grave and decent, and many of the prayers are incomparably the be&s;t that are extant, and as good as could be devis'd. But are there not others that are very exceptionable, and cannot well be joined with? Why may not the&s;e be laid a&s;ide? or what injury would it be, if every Clergyman had a liberty of reading them, or leaving them out, according as he and his congregation &s;hall approve, or di&s;like them? If they are only <HI>human</HI> compo&s;ures, why &s;hould &s;uch regard be paid to them, than which no &s;tronger can be paid to tho&s;e that are <HI>divine</HI>? and every one mu&s;t as uni|ver&s;ally agree to them? I think this is a ve|ry
<PB N="19" REF="18">
great hard&s;hip both upon clergy and lai|ty, and effectually deprives both of that li|berty of <HI>private judgment,</HI> which they have an indi&s;putable right to. 'Tis wonderful they do not exert them&s;elves, and &s;tand up for their rights and privileges; and that <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who cannot bear the thought of <HI>civil</HI> &s;lavery, can yet be zealous for <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal.</HI> Di&s;&s;enters think it an incon&s;i&s;tency to be <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and not to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the liberty of their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>The laity &s;hould con&s;ider that if they were univer&s;ally again&s;t impo&s;itions, it would not be in the power of the clergy to lay them upon them; and therefore they are in a great mea&s;ure acce&s;&s;ory even to tho&s;e which are put upon the <HI>freer</HI> clergy them&s;elves. And however they may think it excu&s;able to com|ply with the authority of the <HI>civil magi&s;trate,</HI> for that is all that can be &s;aid for them, yet I thought it had been long inconte&s;table that the civil magi&s;trate has no power in matters of a religious nature; for if he has any at all, he has the &s;ame in <HI>Turky,</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> and all other parts of the world; and the &s;ame rea&s;ons of order, decency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be as &s;trong there as here. Why then &s;hould they give up a right to the magi&s;trate, which he can have no rea&s;onable claim to? The whole right he has at all is deriv'd on|ly from the con&s;ent of the people; but the people have always, in <HI>free</HI> countries, re&s;erv'd
<PB N="20" REF="19">
&s;ome previledges, as &s;acred, to them&s;elves, which they ought not, nor cannot part with. Such are tho&s;e of judging of the conduct of the magi&s;trate, of writing and &s;peaking free|ly on all &s;ubjects, and con&s;equently the liber|ty of the pre&s;s; and whenever the govern|ment has endeavour'd to deprive them of the&s;e, they have immediately grown jealous of &s;lavery, and &s;ome way or other prevented it: and all tho&s;e who, have not &s;tood up in their defence, have been thought enemies to the con&s;titution. But certainly the liberty of judging for them&s;elves in matters of reli|gion is infinitely preferable to the&s;e, and what they ought never to re&s;ign upon any views what&s;oever. And if every church was to u&s;e a private method of wor&s;hip of their own, and <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> only, in general, was to be the e&s;tabli&s;h'd religion in the&s;e king|doms, what would be the prejudice? Men would &s;earch into tho&s;e matters for them|&s;elves, and heats of party, which have had the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of any thing, would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e then none of them could be uppermo&s;t; and 'tis likely no other zeal but that for brotherly love could prevail among&s;t us. Men could not have le&s;s religion, for it is not true religion that is forc'd; but every one's, when 'tis his own, would be mo&s;t likely to be genuine. The&s;e are the de&s;ire|able con&s;equences of private judgment,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
and the&s;e are the principles of the Di&s;&s;en|ters.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, we are all agreed that the civil magi&s;trate has a right to annex what preferments and rewards he plea&s;es, to learn|ing and merit, and that the Bi&s;hops, as they are creatures of the civil power, are to be honour'd as Nobility; and whoever will not give their Lord&s;hips that re&s;pect which is due to their quality, over and a|bove their per&s;onal merit, is whim&s;ical and unmannerly. But when they pretend to con|vey <HI>&s;piritual gifts,</HI> and that no one can be a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t who is not regularly or|dain'd by them; when they pretend to be the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ours of the Apo&s;tles, and have a divine authority for governing the churches, they are &s;o far from de&s;erving hon|our that they &s;hould be de&s;pis'd. This I &s;hould not have mention'd, but thought it an ex|ploded opinion, if Mr. <HI>Betty</HI> had not, in a Sermon to a full and reverend a&s;&s;embly at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and dedicated to his Lord&s;hip of that dioce&s;s, again reviv'd it. But as I be|lieve the laity are not &s;o very prie&s;t-ridden as to become pro&s;elytes to him, I &s;hall only &s;ay that the civil magi&s;trate, upon whom he and all in the e&s;tabli&s;hment de|pend, is, in my opinion, too indulgent, in not calling him to account for his in|&s;olence in &s;etting him&s;elf and his brother <HI>repre&s;entatives of God</HI> &s;o much &s;uperiour to
<PB N="22" REF="21">
him, as to be <HI>&s;uperiour to Angels and Arch|angels them&s;elves.</HI> The&s;e opinions are very prejudicial to &s;ociety, and I think the mo&s;t ju&s;tly puni&s;hable of any.</P>
<P>Such authority as this you, Sir, and your brethren do not pretend to claim, and for that rea&s;on are to be honour'd, &s;ince you have every whit as much right to it, and I believe have receiv'd <HI>the Spirit of God</HI>; tho' not <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> from the hands of a dio|ce&s;an Bi&s;hop. If learning, virtue, and piety are meritorious, how many di&s;&s;enting Mini|&s;ters have merit? and why do not the laity rather e&s;pou&s;e your cau&s;e, than the cau&s;e of &s;uch vain and pert pretenders? For Clergymen of every denomination are only valuable for their per&s;onal, not for their reflected merit, whether from their predece&s;&s;ours, or from the government. How|ever if the laity are willing to be impos'd upon, there is no help for it, they mu&s;t be indulg'd. I know there are &s;ome of them who think 'tis no impo&s;ition, &s;ince they <HI>con|form</HI> out of their own choice, and may, by the toleration, go to &s;eparate congregations, if they plea&s;e. But they are not free in ei|ther ca&s;e; the only difference is this, in one they <HI>give</HI> up their liberty, in the other 'tis <HI>taken away</HI> from them.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this general con&s;ideration of impo&s;ition, I think, they may make &s;everal particular objections to the ceremonies of
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the church, and &s;ee the hard&s;hips that lie upon them. The general rule in the &s;crip|ture for religious wor&s;hip is, that <HI>all things &s;hould be done decently and in order.</HI> But what an indecent noi&s;e is made by the re&s;pon&s;es? the mo&s;t confus'd and har&s;h one can hear! What &s;uper&s;tition in bowing to the altar, and the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m? But above all, what tender parent can be willing to give up his own natural right over his child, and have it dedicated in bapti&s;m by others? This &s;eems one of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd ceremonies of the whole. Nay by the 29th canon 'tis expre&s;ly ordain'd that <HI>no parent &s;hall be urg'd to be pre&s;ent, nor be admitted to an&s;wer as god|father for his own child.</HI> The reverend Mr. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> who has lately got an <HI>unmixed light</HI> into tho&s;e things, which he and all his for|mer brethren had been before in <HI>ob&s;cure darkne&s;s</HI> about, labours to vindicate this ce|remony, e&s;pecially again&s;t the objection of its abu&s;e; tho' he has forgot to ju&s;tify his &s;ub&s;cription which is the main objection to his proceeding of all. But &s;urely he ought to think that parents, the neare&s;t relation of all, and who have the mo&s;t tender affection for their own offspring, would, if they are &s;erious in the matter, be very glad to offer them up to God them&s;elves, and are mo&s;t nearly engag'd to provide for them. This objection was &s;trong at the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of it, but more e&s;pecially is it &s;o now, when
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the pernicious con&s;equences of it have been &s;o much felt; how few are there that per|form the promi&s;e they make, or who is there that does not turn it into je&s;t? This &s;ingle impo&s;ition would keep me from their com|munion, &s;ince I could not in con&s;cience a&s;k a Mini&s;ter who has &s;ub&s;crib'd to the ca|nons to admini&s;ter the ordinance without it; for the 38th &s;ays, <HI>a mini&s;ter who omits to u&s;e the form of common prayer, or any of the orders or ceremonies pre&s;crib'd in the communion book, let him be &s;u&s;pended</HI>; and &s;o I mu&s;t be either a &s;tranger at my child's bapti&s;m, or el&s;e tempt the Mini&s;ter to break the &s;olemn promi&s;e he has made. Parents, who are unnatural e|nough to approve of this, are incapable of being rea&s;on'd out of it; and as to the re&s;t, let their affections to their children &s;peak. I &s;hall mention but one notorious impo&s;ition more, for I would not appear tedious or di&s;|putatious, and that is, <HI>kneeling</HI> at the com|munion. I do not object to the po&s;ture it|&s;elf; there are many who think it the mo&s;t reverend of any, and they ought to u&s;e it but there are others who &s;cruple it, and there|fore ought to be excus'd. But if the mo&s;t did agree in it, why &s;hould it be made <HI>nece&s;&s;a|ry</HI> to communion, &s;o that who&s;oever will not comply with it mu&s;t be excluded? Would the decency, &s;olemnity, or validity of the ordinance be le&s;s, if &s;ome kneel'd, others were pro&s;trate, and others &s;tood? certainly
<PB N="25" REF="24">
not, for there would be a greater appear|ance of true devotion, and le&s;s of coldne&s;s and formality.</P>
<P>So that all the&s;e re&s;traints in the church are very great hard&s;hips upon the laity, and I wonder they &s;o univer&s;ally comply with them; but more e&s;pecially at tho&s;e who were <HI>call'd unto Liberty</HI> among&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, but yet have for&s;aken it, and voluntarily put on the fetters of the church. If they have known the&s;e to be the principles of the Di&s;|&s;enters, I know not what to &s;ay, but that ei|ther they are in love with bondage, or el&s;e they cannot act con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e prin|ciples, and they may as well be impos'd upon in the church as out of it; indeed I cannot &s;ay but they had, e&s;pecially the clergy, who are in the way of getting more by it.</P>
<P>And here I wi&s;h, Sir, I could rather ex|po&s;tulate with them that they are mi&s;taken, than join with them in the complaint. The&s;e principles are &s;o exceeding good that none but tho&s;e, who have too extravagant an o|pinion of their own power, and who delight to exerci&s;e it, can oppo&s;e them, as &s;oon as they are mention'd; and I have &s;een per|&s;ons always educated Di&s;&s;enters (who yet thro' &s;ome di&s;like, or other, have been going off to the church) &s;urpriz'd to hear there were principles &s;o &s;trong to detain them. And there are many who have no objection to
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the ceremonies in them&s;elves, that yet, when they con&s;ider' them as <HI>impo&s;itions,</HI> cannot but object to them, but are forc'd to comply with them, becau&s;e they think there is &s;ome|thing equivalent among the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Too many of the younger people know no other rea&s;ons for their &s;eparation, than be|cau&s;e 'tis a <HI>&s;in</HI> for the Mini&s;ter to wear a &s;ur|plice, or bow towards the altar, or for them&s;elves to bow at the name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> read their prayers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but when they come to con&s;ider the&s;e things, and find no immo|rality in them; that they are <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd</HI> cere|monies, and many of them grave, &s;olemn, and chearful, they fancy 'tis only a whim to &s;tand out for things of le&s;&s;er importance, and &s;o re&s;ign their liberty at once, and ten to one become zealous for their chains. But this is thinking by halves, and indeed if they think no farther they may be as ea&s;y in the church as any-where. I per&s;onally know many who have been thus drawn into it, and have nothing to &s;ay in an&s;wer to the prin|ciples I have mention'd, but that they do not &s;ee they are <HI>practis'd</HI> among us. Indeed it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd there is generally &s;o much <HI>bigotry</HI> and manag'd in &s;o <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> a way, that I do not wonder at the decay of our intere&s;t. When men are as warm for di&s;putable opinions of their own, as for the ceremonies of wor&s;hip, 'tis as well to com|ply with the la&s;t as with the fir&s;t, and of
<PB N="27" REF="26">
all <HI>Tories,</HI> di&s;&s;enting <HI>Tories</HI> are the mo&s;t in|con&s;i&s;tent. But when men will practi&s;e as freely as they think, 'tis then only they are truly unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>The different denominations of Pre&s;byte|rians, Independents, and Bapti&s;ts ari&s;e from different notions of the government of the church and its communion; but heats and contentions about them &s;eem happily to be laid a&s;ide, and they agree in a friendly man|ner among&s;t each other, tho' all think their particular one to be the &s;criptural method. Let them enjoy their &s;entiment with free|dom, as long as they do not quarrel about it or avoid one another upon its account; for a friendly di&s;&s;ention here is as nece&s;&s;ary as from the church. I mu&s;t own I think none of them to be the only &s;criptural method, becau&s;e there is no method at all laid down in the &s;criptures, but is left to the di&s;cretion of them all: but 'tis plain every one ought to follow what <HI>he thinks</HI> to be the &s;criptural method, as long as he does not impo&s;e it as &s;uch upon the re&s;t. If they would but en|joy their other &s;entiments in as friendly a manner, we might have a good pro&s;pect; but 'till then I am quite out of hopes. For their different characteri&s;ticks are now from their different notions in metaphy&s;ical di&s;putes; and <HI>Calvini&s;m, Arminiani&s;m, Baxteriani&s;m,</HI> or <HI>A|riani&s;m</HI> are to each other a mutual term of re|proach; in&s;omuch that even the lower and mo&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="27">
ignorant &s;ort of people have often fallen out about the&s;e things, tho' they know no more of them than the Lady who would not &s;uffer her daughter to marry an <HI>Arminian,</HI> merely becau&s;e he was &s;o. And how can this be o|therwi&s;e when Mini&s;ters are perpetually writ|ing and preaching again&s;t each other, each party as warm, as if the whole &s;alvation of mankind depended upon their faith in the&s;e dubious matters? The unhappy difference at <HI>Salters-Hall</HI> injur'd the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t more than all their enemies together. Many who acted con&s;i&s;tently with their principles were thereby driven to the greate&s;t inconve|niences, and their opponents &s;pirited up their congregations to u&s;e them ill, and &s;ometimes even to a nece&s;&s;ity of leaving them for ever. But where was the liberty for <HI>every man to be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind</HI>? when he was oblig'd, not to con&s;ult his own &s;entiments, but the humour of his people. How many were forc'd to quit the mini&s;try entirely, be|cau&s;e they could not conform to the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd impo&s;itions either of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or tho&s;e which the Di&s;&s;enters them|&s;elves introduc'd in their &s;tead? when they ought rather to have been valu'd as men of hone&s;ty and principle; for what could be a greater demon&s;tration of it, than to &s;acrifice their own intere&s;ts to what they thought the publick good?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
Sir, I do not mention this to revive the unhappy difference, no, 'twould grieve me to be the in&s;trument of any new mi&s;chief! I only mention it to &s;hew that &s;uch di&s;putes tend to weaken the common intere&s;t, and oc|ca&s;ion its de&s;truction: How often have the people reproach'd you, that the Mini&s;ters can't agree among them&s;elves? If they mean in &s;entiment, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible. If they mean in brotherly love, the reproach is too ju&s;t, and you do not follow your prin|ciples. For my own part, I value mode|rate men of each &s;ide the que&s;tion; tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;crib'd in the fear of God, and in brotherly love, te&s;tify'd their zeal for what they thought the chri&s;tian faith; and tho&s;e who did not &s;ub&s;cribe, with the &s;ame tem|per, te&s;tify'd their zeal for what they thought to be chri&s;tian liberty, and the principles of the Di&s;&s;enters. The de&s;ign of each was good, as long as they &s;topp'd there; but it became evil, when they tended to inflame their own pa&s;&s;ions and their people's, and denounc'd too hard and &s;evere cen&s;ures upon each other. As long as the&s;e parties are kept up, and mu|tual liberty is oppre&s;s'd, your intere&s;t can ne|ver revive; but when you give the liberty that is due to each other 'tis very po&s;&s;ible it may: But bigotry will ever be the ruin of every cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I know, Sir, you under&s;tand me too well, when I &s;peak of <HI>bigotry,</HI> to think I mean an
<PB N="30" REF="29">
attachment to one's own principles. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for any one to be without, and a man ought to act con&s;i&s;tently with them, or el&s;e he re&s;igns his judgment, and has no &s;et|tled rule of action. By <HI>bigotry</HI> I only mean &s;o violent an intere&s;t in particular &s;entiments as to impo&s;e them upon others, and occa&s;ion cen&s;ure if they do not receive them; or el&s;e &s;uch an ob&s;tinacy in pre&s;ent &s;entiments, as will &s;ilence all others that are different from them. Here it ought to be con&s;ider'd, that, when this is the ca&s;e, the civil magi&s;trate has an equal right to re&s;train you all, as you have to re&s;train one another; from whence 'tis plain that nothing, but the <HI>Liberty</HI> I have been &s;peaking of, can be the <HI>fundamental</HI> principle of the Di&s;&s;enters, and the &s;upport of their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They mi&s;take our principles who think we pretend to be in every tittle perfect, or better than the church, and &s;hun us, becau&s;e they do not find our actions agreeable to this opinion. Whoever imagine this of them|&s;elves are exceedingly mi&s;taken and intole|rably vain; nor are the whole body of Di&s;|&s;enters to be reproach'd, becau&s;e there are &s;uch among&s;t them. I know there are &s;ome who mi&s;take them&s;elves to be the only go&s;|pel churches, and would join with no other upon any terms. But their &s;piritual pride is as odious to the more generous of us, as 'tis to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Certainly, Sir,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
tho&s;e in the e&s;tabli&s;hment would think it ve|ry unju&s;t in us to reflect all the &s;uper&s;tition of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> or of Dr. <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> upon their communion; yet 'tis as unfair in them to think us all as enthu&s;ia&s;tical as the mo&s;t rigid <HI>Antinomians.</HI> But tho they have an <HI>equal</HI> right with the re&s;t to enjoy their o|pinions, we differ as much from them as from the church.</P>
<P>If the whole pre&s;ent generation of the lai|ty were to know this, I doubt not but they would continue with us, &s;ince if they do not find all the in&s;tances of liberty they de&s;ire, 'twould be no difficult matter to rai&s;e congre|gations where they might fix them; and then they would likewi&s;e pre&s;erve the younger Mini&s;ters too who are forc'd to go into the church, &s;ince they cannot meet with encou|ragement in their &s;entiments at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It has often been wonder'd at, and there|fore made an objection to the free principles I have advanc'd, that tho&s;e who have con|form'd from us to the church have generally been of the&s;e &s;entiments, and yet have re&s;ign'd them notwith&s;tanding. I mu&s;t confe&s;s 'tis a very great unhappine&s;s that they have been forc'd to do &s;o, and I believe it has always aro&s;e from their not being able to live by them; therefore why do not we con&s;ider this, and endeavour to prevent it? 'Tis a very great weakening of our intere&s;t that the be&s;t are oblig'd in ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, to their
<PB N="32" REF="31">
families, and to &s;ociety, which they ought not to encumber, to quit us, and &s;eek provi|&s;ion el&s;ewhere; and that tho&s;e are principally maintain'd who&s;e births and hopes are low, and con&s;equently can practi&s;e the low arts of wheedling the people into a choice of them. Indeed I wonder the people them&s;elves are not above this, and why they will not be well in&s;tructed by tho&s;e who have the cou|rage to teach them even di&s;agreeable truths, rather than flatter'd into what may po&s;&s;ibly be fal&s;e, and, if it be true, is but of the lea&s;t importance in religion. If flattering and in|dulging the people be the only way to &s;uc|ceed with us, the Bi&s;hops and &s;ecular powers may as well be flatter'd, &s;ince they are much better able to pay for it. And whoever can|not go into the church, becau&s;e he cannot &s;ubmit to things contrary to ju&s;tice, genero&s;i|ty, and freedom, ought not to &s;ubmit to them among&s;t us. So that I cannot but admire, and value the virtue of tho&s;e younger Gentle|men, who, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e difficul|ties, remain with us, &s;ince their want of &s;ucce&s;s is only owing to their want of this mean and groveling art. I wi&s;h tho&s;e Gentlemen, who <HI>have been</HI> &s;trong and powerful advocates for liberty, would rather have &s;ought &s;ome, civil than eccle&s;ia&s;tical, preferments from the go|vernment, &s;ince they have now given up the cau&s;e, which does it a greater prejudice, than never to have engag'd in it. I doubt not
<PB N="33" REF="32">
but as they are many of them per&s;ons of virtue and piety, as well as of learning and good &s;en&s;e, they have taken care <HI>&s;ome way, or other,</HI> to &s;atisfy them&s;elves in what they have done. I wi&s;h I could gue&s;s at the principle, and make an excu&s;e, more honourable for them, and more creditable to us, than nece&s;&s;i|ty; but as I think the &s;ub&s;cription will not bear it, unle&s;s they are in <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> &s;enti|ments, I know not what to &s;ay farther; I &s;hall forbear to judge them however, and think the be&s;t and mo&s;t worthily of them that I am able.</P>
<P>I know, Sir, the blame of this has often been laid upon you and your brethren, that <HI>you</HI> do not provide for them, and &s;ettle them according to their merit. But I think no|thing can be more unju&s;t, and more contrary to your principles; for as you pretend to no authority over the people, you have not the di&s;po&s;al of their congregations, nor any right to be their dictators. Indeed the people may con&s;ult you as friends, and per&s;ons intimately acquainted with each other's characters, but they have the choice in them&s;elves, and are not to be over-rul'd: and 'twould be better they would generally con&s;ult the reputation of the intere&s;t more than their own particular fancy. 'Tis an ill principle not to receive in&s;truction, unle&s;s it be given in a particular manner; and a great many of tho&s;e things that <HI>plea&s;e</HI> the people have very often a bad tendency in general. 'Tis good to plea&s;e ten
<PB N="34" REF="33">
per&s;ons, but not to drive as many away from us. Truth and good &s;en&s;e will generally be for edification; but the being pleas'd, which they generally in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon, &s;eldom ari&s;es from any thing but &s;ome odd|ne&s;s that hits their peculiar humour, and is not from any view to edification at all; therefore too mean to be worthy any one's &s;tudy. The people do not u&s;ually know wherein oratory, &s;trength of &s;peech, the art of per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> con&s;i&s;t, and therefore 'tis vanity in &s;uch to pretend to be judges of them. I wi&s;h I could deny that, among&s;t us, they generally fall into the fal&s;e&s;t and lowe&s;t ta&s;te imaginable. In the&s;e things I think 'twould be an in&s;tance of their mode&s;ty to re&s;ign up their plea&s;ures to the general no|tions and judgment, for then there could be no general objections again&s;t them; thus a man would mortify his inclinations to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, for the good of &s;ociety. Whoever con&s;ults the writings, or prejudices again&s;t us will find nothing objected of any value, but again&s;t the aukwardne&s;s and unpolitene&s;s of our Preachers. What was Dr. <HI>South</HI>'s wit levell'd again&s;t, but tho&s;e things that were really fooli&s;h and ridiculous in them&s;elves? and &s;o people of wit and politene&s;s grew a&s;ham'd of them, and cho&s;e a more <HI>graceful</HI> way of religion. Therefore I admire the art of our opponents rather to banter and ridi|cule, than argue with us. But when we take
<PB N="35" REF="34">
away this objection and poli&s;h our&s;elves, let another Dr. <HI>South</HI> endeavour to ridicule us anew. So that herein I think the people &s;hould rather con&s;ult our general credit than their own humours; and if they would en|courage our younger Mini&s;ters who &s;tudy good &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, and endeavour to recommend the intere&s;t to the e&s;teem of the re&s;t of mankind, I make no doubt but 'twould &s;till revive and flouri&s;h more than ever; but if they will continue &s;elfi&s;hly to indulge them|&s;elves, they have an indi&s;putable <HI>right</HI> to ru|in and de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, Sir, of your general di&s;po&s;ition, whenever the people think fit to con&s;ult you in their choice, to promote the intere&s;t of tho&s;e whom you think mo&s;t like|ly to do us a credit upon the whole. The credit of the intere&s;t can only ari&s;e from the learning and piety of tho&s;e engag'd in it. The latter without the former is amiable in private life, but no <HI>complete</HI> recommenda|tion of a Mini&s;ter; and the fir&s;t alone, tho' it may enliven his publick performances, is not &s;ufficient for his <HI>whole</HI> relation. They mu&s;t both join to make him perfect. And here I cannot but look about me with plea&s;ure, &s;ince we have &s;till <HI>&s;ome</HI> remaining of this character, who&s;e publick labours and private lives and conver&s;ation are both u&s;eful and entertaining. The Church of <HI>England</HI> may know this, and grow jealous, unle&s;s &s;he hopes
<PB N="36" REF="35">
from the perver&s;ene&s;s of our people to draw them over to her &s;ide; and indeed if &s;ome proper methods are not taken to prevent it, I will not promi&s;e for them; for they were not born to &s;tarve, and 'tis a &s;in to do it, if there is a ju&s;tifiable prevention.</P>
<P>There are many who confidently a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e Gentlemen's learning and politene&s;s will be our ruin. But what can be more ab|&s;urd and perver&s;e? For nothing can recover tho&s;e who have le&s;t us for want of the&s;e, but the &s;tudy of them. There are many Gentlemen, who can give no other rea&s;on, for leaving us, but that they are a&s;ham'd of our intere&s;t; but that can be no longer a rea&s;on, when we have the very qualities they &s;eek in the Church. There is no other advantage in principle, or practice, &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly have over us, but then &s;he can have none. I believe there are <HI>many</HI> of the laity who are not &s;o much again&s;t this as 'tis imagin'd. They have lately done &s;ome very con&s;iderable things to en|courage learning and good &s;en&s;e. El&s;e whence the crouded auditory to a certain lecture, than which a greater or finer among&s;t us was never e&s;tabli&s;h'd? And I believe, whenever the Preach|er &s;inks in the goodne&s;s of his &s;ermons, he will &s;ink in the e&s;teem and encouragement of the hearers. But as I believe he is incapa|ble of it; &s;o I hope it will be an encourage|ment to follow his example of love to truth and original chri&s;tianity, which he has defend|ed
<PB N="37" REF="36">
in the polite&s;t and fine&s;t manner of any Writer this age has produc'd. There are many others that would &s;hine out, if they had the &s;ame advantages from the world; but as they may hope it will, in time, be ju&s;t to them, as it has been to him, I hope they will &s;upport their courage, and &s;truggle, 'till they at la&s;t recover the intere&s;t from its pre|&s;ent low condition.</P>
<P>Since therefore 'tis po&s;&s;ible a free and ge|nerous way of thinking and &s;peaking may plea&s;e among us, &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Gentlemen were no longer in fear of being under di&s;|agreeable, cen&s;ures, and har&s;h imputations, but had as <HI>unbounded a liberty</HI> of &s;peaking their &s;entiments in publick, as of forming them in private, I apprehend they would have no longer inclinations towards the Church, where after having well got thro' the difficulty of entrance, they frequently take more liberty than either their general rules or our bye laws will allow: &s;uppo&s;ing likewi&s;e the gro&s;s of the people, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;uming the charac|ters of Judges and Cen&s;ors of &s;ermons, would put on the mode&s;t and humble di&s;po|&s;ition of learners, which is not at all incon|&s;i&s;tent with their judging for them&s;elves, and receive the truth without being jealous of here&s;y in their younger Preachers, they would no longer terrify and frighten them from us, nor give them an opportunity of complaining that they do not act con&s;i&s;tent|ly
<PB N="38" REF="37">
with their principles. For I know not whence it comes to pa&s;s, but if they happen to think out of the common road, and &s;peak elegantly and politely, it is immediately thought they are inclin'd to the Church, becau&s;e they are <HI>like</HI> it, and, being con&s;equently &s;hunn'd and avoided, are unavoidably forc'd into it. But mu&s;t we keep aloof from every thing like the Church, becau&s;e &s;ome things in it are wrong? <HI>Fas e&s;t &amp; ab ho&s;te doceri.</HI> We &s;hould follow what is really good, and learn it, tho' it were from our greate&s;t enemies. Certainly if our younger people are general|ly inclining to the Church, the more we are like it, the more they will value us, and be likely to &s;tay with us; and 'tis wicked to di&s;like any thing, merely becau&s;e it re&s;embles another. If they go on in this unrea&s;onable prejudice, we &s;hall in time lo&s;e both Mini|&s;ters and people. It ought to be con&s;ider'd that as the ta&s;te of mankind differs, &s;o the method of applying to it mu&s;t differ; and therefore what was fa&s;hionable to our fore|fathers is now as di&s;agreeable to us as their dre&s;s, which no one is &s;o fooli&s;hly &s;ingular as to continue. But yet whoever will compare the pert oratory of a young <HI>Oxonian,</HI> and the &s;olid as well as polite &s;ermons of one of our young|er Divines will di&s;cern but very little re&s;em|blance; &s;o con&s;equently there is as little danger.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I given you my &s;enti|ments of the &s;ubject we happen'd upon in
<PB N="39" REF="38">
conver&s;ation; and I have pur&s;u'd them in the method that appears to me mo&s;t likely to &s;erve the intere&s;t of truth and religion. I have addre&s;s'd them in a Letter to you, becau&s;e I have long known your candour and good|ne&s;s, and I believe you cannot be con&s;cious of having contributed to the decay, &s;ince, without flattery, you would be a credit to a|ny cau&s;e whatever. Since that time, I have thought of &s;ome regulations, which I be|lieve would forward the de&s;ir'd effect, to pre&s;erve and revive the intere&s;t; but I &s;ubmit them to your judgment, and the judgment of your brethren. They relate to the ma|nagement of our publick a&s;&s;emblies, and to the per&s;ons educated for the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>I think there are two faults in your man|ner of publick wor&s;hip, that your prayers are too &s;hort, and your &s;ermons too long. The one has too little of reverence towards God, and the other is too tedious to our&s;elves. It appears to me that the principal de&s;ign of publick a&s;&s;emblies is to wor&s;hip God in &s;oci|ety, which tends mo&s;t of any thing to main|tain a &s;en&s;e of religion in the world; and one of the greate&s;t parts of it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in adoration of him, and celebrating his per|fections. This infinitely becomes us, as we are dependent creatures, and &s;tand at an in|finite di&s;tance from God our Maker. 'Tis both a &s;olemn and plea&s;ant employment; it tends to enoble our natures, pre&s;erve us
<PB N="40" REF="39">
from vice, and beget in us all tho&s;e affections of love, fear, and joy, that re&s;ult from our relation to the mo&s;t amiable, powerful, and indulgent Being. Nothing creates a greater plea&s;ure to me than <HI>rational</HI> wor&s;hip. As on the one hand I abominate all foppi&s;hne&s;s and buffoonery in religion, &s;o on the other I hate an affected gravity, that has nothing in it manly and chearful. A mixture of re|verence and chearfulne&s;s is the true &s;pirit of devotion. There is too little of the one in &s;ome places, and too little of the other among us. To this of longer prayers, it may be objected that they may be difficult to the &s;uppliant, and tedious for the peo|ple. But by longer prayers, I only mean longer in proportion to the &s;ermon. I think to wor&s;hip God for twenty minutes, and to dictate to men for &s;ixty, is not &s;o equal as one could wi&s;h. If it be difficult for the Mini&s;ter, 'tis but for him to compo&s;e his prayers before, when his mind may be in a better temper and di&s;po&s;ition, and he may have lei&s;ure to review whether what he &s;ays be proper and worthy of the divine Being, or not. I know not why the people &s;hould object to this, any more than to the u&s;e of notes in your &s;er|mons, for, at fir&s;t, the one was as much a novelty as the other may be now; or why you &s;hould &s;tudy more accuracy in the la&s;t than in the fir&s;t. It would prevent a great
<PB N="41" REF="40">
deal of tautology, incorrectne&s;s, and impro|prieties, and too often things ab&s;olutely unfit to be utter'd: which I think are very indecent to|wards our Maker. As to this method's being tedious to the hearers, I would not have them &s;o long as that comes to; and if there be any danger of it, I cannot but recom|mend the practice of the Church, of diver&s;i|fying the wor&s;hip; but this &s;hould be at the di&s;cretion of the Mini&s;ter. The &s;inging of p&s;alms, when you happen to have a good clerk, would relieve the mind; and the whole of this would prevent the objections again&s;t <HI>extempore</HI> prayers, which have often been too unluckily made.</P>
<P>As to your &s;ermons, excu&s;e me, Sir, I think they too might be regulated. They might be &s;horter, and more intel|ligible. I know there are many of our Mini&s;ters who pride them&s;elves in being plain, and to the capacity of the people. But I have been often pre&s;ent, where, thro' the Preacher's di&s;tinctions, hard words, <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> or <HI>&s;chola&s;tical</HI> expre&s;&s;ions, I have been ab|&s;olutely at a lo&s;s for his meaning, if he meant any thing, and came away as ignorant as I went there; and how often have we been in&s;ulted by the Church-party, for what they &s;tile the <HI>cant</HI> of preaching. I think too if they were delivred in a more ea&s;y and <HI>natural</HI> manner, they would hear better, and be more in&s;tructive. I hope no one will think I intend to affront him by
<PB N="42" REF="41">
a particular application; I only &s;ay it in the general with a regard to our own credit, and the publick good.</P>
<P>From this it will appear how nece&s;&s;ary it is to take great care of per&s;ons to be educated for the mini&s;try; that they &s;hould be creditable and promi&s;ing, cho&s;en either out of the families of Gentlemen, or el&s;e upon the account of a very extraordinary genius. The fir&s;t, becau&s;e &s;uch are commonly be&s;t ac|quainted with the world, and know how to behave them&s;elves; and the la&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly be advanc'd by their own merit and abilities, without tho&s;e advantages. And as to the fund, if it was only apply'd to the education of tho&s;e who&s;e parents are decay'd, or have &s;pent their fortunes in the intere&s;t, it would be much better than to encourage the vanity of low and mechanical per&s;ons, who imagine a gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in their children, and then throw them to be a di&s;honour and bur|den upon us. Is it lawful to &s;poil a mechanick who might earn his bread, and maintain his family, and take him to mi&s;guide the people? (for they are too often ignorant and vain) bring a family into the world to live meanly, and at la&s;t be left in di&s;tre&s;s? Your con&s;ciences, as well as policy, &s;hould forbid this. And here, by the way, I think it would be well, in&s;tead of encouraging &s;uch by the fund to apply it in larger quantities to men of <HI>real</HI> merit, and furni&s;h them, not barely with bread for their
<PB N="43" REF="42">
bodies, but books to enterain and improve their minds. If a few very &s;mall villages had no <HI>meeting</HI> 'twould be of le&s;s importance than to have large country towns, &s;urrounded with <HI>Tory-</HI>gentlemen, ill furni&s;h'd and di&s;grac'd, Poverty and want are none of the lea&s;t ob|jections to us in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>But to return to Students; if, after they were thus &s;elected, they were perfectly taught <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> and not &s;uffer'd to go to the academy 'till thoroughly acquainted with them: if the time u&s;ually wa&s;ted in old &s;y&s;tems of logick and metaphy&s;icks was &s;pent in &s;tu|dying and <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> the cla&s;&s;icks, the <HI>Belle Letres,</HI> oratory, and particularly the art of &s;peaking <HI>naturally,</HI> ju&s;tly, and genteelly, it would quite de&s;troy all tho&s;e unnatural tones and ge&s;tures, which are the grand cau&s;es of our reproach and contempt. It may &s;eem odd and whim&s;ical to propo&s;e a dancing-ma&s;ter for one tutor at an academy, but if &s;omething equivalent to it was con|trived, to give them a gracefulne&s;s and gen|tility of addre&s;s, and prune off all clum&s;ine&s;s and aukwardne&s;s that is di&s;agreeable to peo|ple of fa&s;hion, and which gives learning the air of pedantry, it would do them a mo&s;t eminent &s;ervice. For nothing carries any man &s;o ea&s;ily and happily thro' life as a good addre&s;s, This may look improper to the general &s;mallne&s;s of your &s;alaries: but 'twould be none if Gentlemen were not
<PB N="44" REF="43">
a&s;ham'd to breed up their children to the mini&s;try, and tho&s;e, who have no great for|tune of their own, had the art of appearing hand&s;ome with a little; which is natural to &s;ome, and might ea&s;ily be acquir'd by others. The &s;ame effect would be an&s;wer'd, if the congregations were fewer, and of con&s;e|quence the &s;alaries larger. I am not for mixing bigotted and generous people in a congregation, for that lays the Mini&s;ter un|der too great re&s;traints to plea&s;e both parties; but in country places prudent management in elections would prevent the fatal and de|&s;tructive breaches that end in the ruin of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I taken a liberty which I hope you will excu&s;e, and which I would not have a&s;&s;um'd the vanity of for any other cau&s;e, but that of Liberty the true foundati|on of the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t; Liberty, which I verily believe to be the cau&s;e of God, and the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
