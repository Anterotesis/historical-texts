How this revolution is to be effected we are informed in the dedication of his Ob&s;ervations on Calculus, &amp;c. p. 4. "We are ju&s;t beginning to catch a glimp&s;e of the laws of animal Nature; <HI>and now when the human mind &s;eems in &s;o many countries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> be rou&s;ed from that torpor, by which it has &s;o long been benumbed, we may rea&s;on|ably indulge the expectation of a rapid progre&s;s in this the mo&s;t beneficial of all the &s;ciences.</HI> An infinitely &s;mall portion of genius has hitherto been exerted to dimini&s;h the &s;um of our painful &s;en&s;ations; <HI>and the force of &s;ociety has been exclu&s;ively at the di&s;po&s;al of De&s;|pots and Juntos, the great Artificers of human Evil. Should an entire change in the&s;e two re&s;pects any where take place, every member of &s;ociety might &s;oon expect to experience in his own per&s;on the con&s;equence of &s;o happy an innovation; and &s;hould the example be generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, there is no improvement in the condition of the World, for which we might not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from the bloodle&s;s rival&s;hip of Nations.</HI>" But we are told, that the &s;ame influence of Liberty and Genius will not only in other re&s;pects effect equal wonders, but produce greater ble&s;&s;ings. "We know," exclaims this egregious Chymi&s;t, "that vegetables are capable of forming oils either exactly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Animals, or very nearly re&s;embling them. Thus we have the &s;uet of the Croton Sebiferum, the butter of the Phoenix Dactylifera and of the Butyrum Cacao. <HI>When, from a more intimate acquaint|ance with them, we &s;hall be better able to apply the Laws of organic bodies to the accommo|dation as well as pre&s;ervation of Life, may we not, by regulating the vegetable functions, teach our woods and hedges to &s;upply us with Butter and Tallow?</HI>" Ob&s;ervations on Calculus, &amp;c. p. 109.</NOTE> No more the lazy Ox &s;hall gormandize,</L>
