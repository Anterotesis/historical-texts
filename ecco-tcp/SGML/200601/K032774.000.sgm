<HEAD>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late Archbi&s;hop Secker, who&s;e memory is en|titled to public re&s;pect, as on many accounts, &s;o e&s;pecially for the judgement with which he de&s;cribed, and the affecting &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which he recommended, the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, in one of his charges to the clergy of his dioce&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury's Third Charge to his Clergy. Abp. Secker's Works, vol. iv.</NOTE>, exhorts them "to make their &s;ermons local." I have always con&s;idered this advice as founded in a knowledge of human life, but as requiring, in its application, a more than ordinary exerci&s;e of chri&s;|tian prudence. Whil&s;t I repeat therefore the rule it&s;elf, with great veneration for the authority by which it was
<PB N="6" REF="4">
delivered, I think it no unfit employment of the pre&s;ent opportunity, to enlarge &s;o far upon its u&s;e and meaning, as to point out &s;ome of the in&s;tances in which it may be adopted, with the probability of making &s;alutary impre&s;|&s;ions upon the minds of our hearers.</P>
<P>But, before I proceed, I would warn you, and that with all the &s;olemnity that can belong to any admonition of mine, again&s;t rendering your di&s;cour&s;es <HI>&s;o local,</HI> as to be pointed and levelled at particular per&s;ons in your con|gregation. This &s;pecies of addre&s;s may produce in the party, for whom it is intended, confu&s;ion perhaps and &s;hame, but not with their proper fruits of penitence and humility. In&s;tead of which, the&s;e &s;en&s;ations will be ac|companied with bitter re&s;entment again&s;t the preacher, and a kind of ob&s;tinate and determined oppo&s;ition to his reproof. He will impute your officiou&s;ne&s;s to per&s;onal enmity, to party &s;pirit, to the plea&s;ure of triumphing over an adver&s;ary without interruption or reply, to in|&s;ult a&s;&s;uming the form of advice, or to any motive ra|ther than a con&s;cientious &s;olicitude for the amendment and &s;alvation of your &s;lock. And as the per&s;on him&s;elf &s;eldom profits by admonitions conveyed in this way, &s;o are they equally u&s;ele&s;s or perhaps noxious to the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly; for the moment the congregation di&s;cover
<PB N="7" REF="5">
to whom the cha&s;ti&s;ement is directed, from that moment they cea&s;e to apply any part of it to them&s;elves. They are not edified, they are not affected, on the contrary they are diverted, by de&s;criptions of which they &s;ee the de&s;ign, and by invectives of which they think they com|prehend the aim. Some who would feel &s;trongly the impropriety of gro&s;s and evident per&s;onalities, may yet hope to hit their mark by covert and oblique allu&s;ions. Now of this &s;cheme, even when conducted with the greate&s;t &s;kill, it may be ob&s;erved, that the allu&s;ions mu&s;t either be perceived, or not. If they be not perceived, they fail of the effect intended by them; if they be, they are open to the objections which lie again&s;t more explicit and undi&s;&s;embled attacks. Whenever we are con&s;cious, in the compo&s;ition of our di&s;cour&s;es, of a view to parti|cular characters in our congregation or pari&s;h, we ought to take for granted that our view will be under&s;tood. Tho&s;e applications therefore, which, if they were direct, would produce more bad emotions than good ones, it is better to di&s;card intirely from our &s;ermons; that is to &s;ay, it is better to lay a&s;ide the de&s;ign altogether, than to attempt to di&s;gui&s;e it by a management which is ge|nerally detected, and which, if not &s;een through, defeats its purpo&s;e by its ob&s;curity. The crimes then of indivi|duals
<PB N="8" REF="6">
let us re&s;erve for opportunities of private and &s;ea|&s;onable expo&s;tulation. Happy is the clergyman who has the faculty of communicating advice and remon&s;trance with per&s;ua&s;ion and effect, and the virtue to &s;eize and improve every proper occa&s;ion of doing it; but in the pulpit let private characters be no otherwi&s;e adverted to, than as they fall in with the delineations of &s;ins and du|ties which our di&s;cour&s;es mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contain, and which, whil&s;t they avoid per&s;onalities, can never be too clo&s;e or circum&s;tantial. For the &s;ame rea&s;on that I think per&s;onal allu&s;ions reprehen&s;ible, I &s;hould condemn any, even the remote&s;t, reference to party or political tran&s;|actions and di&s;putes. The&s;e are at all times unfit &s;ub|jects not only of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the pulpit, but of hints and &s;urmi&s;es. The Chri&s;tian preacher has no other province than that of religion and morality. He is &s;eldom led out of his way by honourable motives, and, I think, never with a beneficial effect.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed this nece&s;&s;ary caution, I return to the rule it&s;elf. By "local" &s;ermons I would under&s;tand, what the reverend prelate who u&s;ed the expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems principally to have meant by it, &s;ermons adapted to the particular &s;tate of thought and opinion, which we per|ceive to prevail in our congregation. A careful atten|tion
<PB N="9" REF="7">
to this circum&s;tance, is of the utmo&s;t importance, becau&s;e as <HI>it</HI> varies, the &s;ame &s;ermon may do a great deal of good, none at all, or much harm. So that it is not the truth of what we are about to offer which alone we ought to con&s;ider, but whether the argument it&s;elf be likely to correct or to promote the turn and bias of opinion, to which we already perceive too &s;trong a ten|dency and inclination. Without this circum&s;pection we may be found to have imitated the folly of the architect, who placed his buttre&s;s on the wrong &s;ide. The more the column pre&s;&s;ed, the more firm was its con&s;truction, and the deeper its foundation, the more certainly it ha&s;|tened the ruin of the fabric. I do not mean that we &s;hould, upon any emergency, advance what is not true; but that, out of many truths, we &s;hould &s;elect tho&s;e, the con&s;ideration of which &s;eems be&s;t &s;uited to rectify the di&s;po&s;itions of thought, that were previou&s;ly declining into error or extravagancy. For this model of preach|ing we may allege the highe&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible authorities, the example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf. He always had in view the po&s;ture of mind of the per&s;ons whom he addre&s;&s;ed. He did not entertain the Phari&s;ees with in|vectives again&s;t the open impiety of their Sadducean ri|vals; nor, on the other hand, did he &s;ooth the Saddu|cee's
<PB N="10" REF="8">
ear with de&s;criptions of phari&s;aical pomp and folly. In the pre&s;ence of the Phari&s;ee he preached again&s;t hy|pocri&s;y: to the Sadducee he proved the re&s;urrection of the dead. In like manner, of that known enmity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Jews and Samaritans this &s;aithful teacher took no undue advantage, to make friends or pro&s;elytes of either. Upon the Jews he incul|cated a more comprehen&s;ive benevolence: with the Sa|maritan he defended the orthodoxy of the Jewi&s;h creed.</P>
<P>But I apprehend that I &s;hall render my advice more intelligible, by exemplifying it in two or three in&s;tances, drawn from what appears to be the predominant di&s;po|&s;ition and religious character of this country and of the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P>In many former ages of religion, the &s;trong propen&s;ity of men's minds was to over-value po&s;itive duties: which temper, when carried to exce&s;s, not only multiplied un|authori&s;ed rites and ob&s;ervances, not only laid an un|warrantable &s;tre&s;s upon tho&s;e which were pre&s;cribed; but, what was wor&s;t of all, led men to expect, that, by a punctual attention to the ordinances of religion, they could compound for a relaxation of its weighty and difficult duties of per&s;onal purity and relative ju&s;tice. This was
<PB N="11" REF="9">
the depraved &s;tate of religion among&s;t the Jews when our Saviour appeared: and it was the degeneracy, again&s;t which &s;ome of the mo&s;t forcible of his admonitions, and the &s;evere&s;t of his reproofs, were directed. Yet notwith|&s;tanding that Chri&s;t's own preaching, as well as the plan and &s;pirit of his religion, were as adver&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to the exalting or over-valuing of po&s;itive in&s;titutions, the error, which had corrupted the old di&s;pen&s;ation, revived under the new; and revived with double force, in&s;o|much as to transform Chri&s;tianity into a &s;ervice more prolix and burthen&s;ome than the Jewi&s;h, and to a&s;cribe an efficacy to certain religious performances, which, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;uper&s;eded the obligations of &s;ub&s;tantial virtue. That age however with us is long &s;ince pa&s;t. I fear there is room to apprehend that we are falling into mi&s;takes of a contrary kind. Sadducees are more common among&s;t us than Phari&s;ees. We &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed, not only to ca&s;t off the decent offices, which the temperate piety of our church hath enjoined, as aids of devotion, calls to re|pentance, or in&s;truments of improvement, but to con|temn and neglect, under the name of forms and cere|monies, even tho&s;e rites, which, fora&s;much as they were ordained by the divine founder of our religion, or by his in&s;pired me&s;&s;engers, and ordained with a view of
<PB N="12" REF="10">
their continuing in force through future generations, are entitled to be accounted parts of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf. In this &s;ituation of religion, and of men's thoughts with re|&s;pect to it, he makes a bad choice of his &s;ubject, who di&s;cour&s;es upon the futility of rites and ordinances, upon their in&s;ignificancy when taken by them&s;elves, or even who in&s;i&s;ts too frequently, and in terms too &s;trong, upon their inferiority to moral precepts. We are rather called upon to &s;u&s;tain the authority of tho&s;e in&s;titutions which proceed from Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles, and the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s and credit of tho&s;e which claim no higher original than public appointment. We are called upon to con|tend with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, that they cannot be omitted with &s;afety any more than other duties; that the will of God once a&s;certained is the immediate foundation of every duty; that, when this will is known, it makes little difference to us what is the &s;ubject of it, &s;till le&s;s by what denomination the precept is called, under what cla&s;s or divi&s;ion the duty is arranged. If it be com|manded, and we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe that it is &s;o, it matters nothing whether the obligation be moral, or natural, or po&s;itive, or in&s;tituted. He who places be|fore him the will of God as the rule of his life, will not refine, or even dwell much, upon the&s;e di&s;tinctions.
<PB N="13" REF="11">
The ordinances of Chri&s;tianity, it is true, are all of them &s;ignificant. Their meaning, and even their u&s;e, is not ob|&s;cure. But were it otherwi&s;e; was the de&s;ign of any po&s;i|tive in&s;titution inexplicable; did it appear to have been propo&s;ed only as an exerci&s;e of obedience, it was not for us to he&s;itate in our compliance. Even to enquire, with too much curio&s;ity and impatience, into the cau&s;e and rea&s;on of a religious command, is no evidence of an humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition; of a di&s;po&s;ition, I mean, humble under the Deity's government of his crea|tion, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his will however &s;igni&s;ied.</P>
<P>It may be &s;ea&s;onable al&s;o to maintain, what I am con|vinced is true, that the principle of general utility which upholds moral obligation it&s;elf, may in various in&s;tances be applied to evince the duty of attending upon po&s;itive in&s;titutions; in other words, that the difference between natural and po&s;itive duties is often more in the name than in the thing. The precepts of natural ju&s;tice are therefore only binding upon the con&s;cience, becau&s;e the ob&s;ervation of them is nece&s;&s;ary or conducive to the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of &s;ocial life. If there be, as there certainly are, religious in&s;titutions which contri|bute greatly to form and &s;upport impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind, that render men better members of civilized com|munity;
<PB N="14" REF="12">
if the&s;e in&s;titutions can only be pre&s;erved in their reputation and influence by the general re&s;pect which is paid to them; there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to each of us for bearing our part in the&s;e ob&s;ervances, that there is for di&s;charging the mo&s;t acknowledged duties of na|tural religion. When I &s;ay "the rea&s;on is the &s;ame," I mean that it is the &s;ame in <HI>kind.</HI> The <HI>degree</HI> of &s;trength and cogency which this rea&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in any particular ca&s;e, mu&s;t always depend upon the value and importance of the particular duty: which admits of great variety. But moral and po&s;itive duties do not in this re&s;pect differ more than moral duties differ from one another. So that when men accu&s;tom them&s;elves to look upon po&s;itive du|ties as univer&s;ally and nece&s;&s;arily inferior to moral ones, as of a &s;ubordinate &s;pecies, as placed upon a different foun|dation, or deduced from a different original; and con&s;e|quently to regard them as unworthy of being made a part of their plan of life, or of entering into their &s;en&s;e of obligation, they appear to be egregiou&s;ly mi&s;led by names. It is our bu&s;ine&s;s, not to aid, but to correct, the deception. Still neverthele&s;s is it as true as ever it was, that, "except we exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, we cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven;" "that the &s;abbath was made for man, and
<PB N="15" REF="13">
not man for the &s;abbath;" "that the weightier matters of the law are faith, ju&s;tice, and mercy:" but to in&s;i&s;t &s;tre|nuou&s;ly, and, as &s;ome do, almo&s;t exclu&s;ively, upon the&s;e points at pre&s;ent, tends to dimini&s;h the re&s;pect for reli|gious ordinances, which is already too little; and, whil&s;t it guards again&s;t dangers that have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t, aug|ments tho&s;e which are really formidable.</P>
<P>Again: Upon the fir&s;t reformation from Popery, a me|thod very much prevailed in the &s;ucceeding churches of re&s;olving the whole of religion into faith; <HI>good works,</HI> as they were called, or the practice of virtue, holding not only a &s;econdary but even di&s;tant place in value and e&s;teem, being repre&s;ented indeed as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no &s;hare or efficacy in the attainment of human &s;alvation. This doctrine we have &s;een revived in our own times, and carried to &s;till greater lengths. And it is a theory, or rather perhaps a language, which required whil&s;t it la&s;ted very &s;erious animad ver&s;ion; not only becau&s;e it di&s;po&s;ed men to re&s;t in an unproductive faith, without endeavours to render them&s;elves u&s;eful by exertion and activity; not only becau&s;e it was naturally capable of being con|verted to the encouragement of licentiou&s;ne&s;s; but be|cau&s;e it mi&s;repre&s;ented Chri&s;tianity, as a moral in&s;titu|tion, by making it place little &s;tre&s;s upon the di&s;tinction
<PB N="16" REF="14">
of virtue and vice, and by making it require the practice of external duties, if it required them at all, only as ca|&s;ual, neglected, and almo&s;t unthought of con&s;equences of that faith which it extolled, in&s;tead of directing men's attention to them, as to tho&s;e things which alone com|po&s;e an unque&s;tionable and effective obedience to the divine will. So long as this turn of mind prevailed, we could not be too indu&s;trious, in bringing together and exhibiting to our hearers, tho&s;e many and po&s;itive decla|rations of &s;cripture, which enforce, and in&s;i&s;t upon, practical religion; which divide mankind into tho&s;e who do good and tho&s;e who do evil; which hold out, to the one favour and happine&s;s, to the other repul&s;e and con|demnation. The danger however from this quarter is nearly overpa&s;t. We are on the contrary &s;etting up a kind of philo&s;ophical morality, detached from religion and independent of its influence, which may be culti|vated, it is &s;aid, as well without Chri&s;tianity as with it; and which, if cultivated, renders religion and religious in&s;titutions &s;uperfluous. A mode of thought, &s;o contrary to truth, and &s;o derogatory from the value of revelation, cannot e&s;cape the vigilance of a Chri&s;tian mini&s;try. We are entitled to a&s;k upon what foundation this morality re&s;ts. If it refer to the divine will (and, without that,
<PB N="17" REF="15">
where will it find its &s;anctions, or how &s;upport its au|thority?), there cannot be a conduct of the under&s;tand|ing more irrational, than to appeal to tho&s;e intimations of the Deity's character which the light and order of nature afford, as to the rule and mea&s;ure of our duty, yet to di&s;regard, and affect to overlook, the declarations of his plea&s;ure which Chri&s;tianity communicates. It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h between the authority of na|tural and revealed religion. We are bound to receive the precepts of revelation for the &s;ame rea&s;on that we comply with the dictates of nature. He who de&s;pi&s;es a command which proceeds from his Maker, no matter by what means, or through what medium, in&s;tead of ad|vancing, as he pretends to do, the dominion of rea&s;on and the authority of natural religion, di&s;obeys the fir&s;t injunction of both. Although it be true, what the apo&s;tle affirms&mdash;that, "when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, they are a law unto them&s;elves," that is, they will be accepted toge|ther with tho&s;e who are in&s;tructed in the law and obey it, yet is this truth not applicable to &s;uch, as having a law contemn it, and with the means of acce&s;s to the word of God, keep them&s;elves at a voluntary di&s;tance from it. This temper, whil&s;t it continues, makes it nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="18" REF="16">
us to a&s;&s;ert the &s;uperiority of a religious principle, above every other by which human conduct can be regulated: more e&s;pecially above that fa&s;hionable &s;y&s;tem, which re|commends virtue only as a true and refined policy, which policy in effect is, and in the end commonly proves it&s;elf to be, nothing el&s;e than a more exqui&s;ite cunning, which by a &s;pecious behaviour in the ea&s;y and vi&s;ible concerns of life collects a fund of reputation, in order either to cheri&s;h more &s;ecurely concealed vices, or to re&s;erve it&s;elf for &s;ome great &s;troke of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, perfidy, and inju&s;tice, in a pre&s;&s;ing conjuncture of fortunes. Nor le&s;s ju&s;tly may we &s;uperinduce the guidance of Chri&s;tianity to the direction of &s;entiment; which de|pends &s;o much upon con&s;titution, upon early impre&s;&s;ions, upon habit and imitation, that unle&s;s it be compared with, and adju&s;ted by, &s;ome &s;afer rule, it can in no wi&s;e be tru&s;ted. Lea&s;t of all ought we to yield the authority of religion to the law of honour, a law (if it de&s;erve that name), which, be&s;ide its continual mutability, is at be&s;t but a &s;y&s;tem of manners &s;uited to the intercour&s;e and accommodation of higher life; and which con&s;e|quently neglects every duty, and permits every vice, that has no relation to the&s;e purpo&s;es. Among&s;t the rules which contend with religion for the government of life,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
the law of the land al&s;o has not a few, who think it very &s;ufficient to act up to its direction, and to keep within the limits which it pre&s;cribes: and this &s;ort of character is common in our congregations.&mdash;We are not to omit, therefore, to apprize tho&s;e who make the &s;tatutes of the realm the &s;tandard of their duty, that they propo&s;e to them&s;elves a mea&s;ure of conduct totally inadequate to the purpo&s;e. The boundaries which na|ture has a&s;&s;igned to human authority and controll, the partial ends to which every legi&s;lator is obliged to con&s;ine his views, prevent human laws, even were they, what they never are, as perfect as they might be made, from becoming competent rules of life to any one, who ad|vances his hopes to the attainment of God Almighty's favor. In contradi&s;tinction then to the&s;e &s;everal &s;y&s;tems which divide a great portion of mankind among&s;t them, we preach "faith which worketh by love," that princi|ple of action and re&s;traint which is found in a Chri&s;tian alone. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities to which none of <HI>them</HI> can make preten&s;ions. It operates where they fail: is pre|&s;ent upon all occa&s;ions, firm upon the greate&s;t; pure as under the in&s;pection of a vigilant omni&s;cience; inno|cent where guilt could not be di&s;covered; ju&s;t, exact, and upright without a witne&s;s to its proceedings; uni|form
<PB N="20" REF="18">
amid&s;t the caprices of fa&s;hion, unchanged by the vici&s;&s;itudes of popular opinion; often applauded, not &s;eldom mi&s;under&s;tood, it holds on its &s;traight and equal cour&s;e, through "good report and evil report," through encouragement and neglect, approbation and di&s;grace. If the philo&s;opher or the politician can point out to us any influence, but that of Chri&s;tianity, which has the&s;e properties, I had almo&s;t &s;aid which does not want them all, we will li&s;ten with reverence to his in&s;truction. But until this be done, we may be permitted to re&s;i&s;t every plan which would place virtue upon any other founda|tion, or &s;eek final happine&s;s through any other medium, than faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. At lea&s;t whil&s;t an inclination to the&s;e rival &s;y&s;tems remains, no good end I am apt to think is attained by decrying faith under any form, by &s;tating the competition between faith and good works, or by pointing out, with too much anxiety, even the abu&s;es and extravagancies, into which the doctrine of &s;al|vation by faith alone has &s;ometimes been carried. The truth is, that, in the two &s;ubjects which I have con&s;ider|ed, we are in &s;uch ha&s;te to fly from enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;u|per&s;tition, that we are approaching towards an in&s;en&s;i|bility to all religious influence. I certainly do not mean to advi&s;e you to endeavour to bring men back to en|thu&s;ia&s;m
<PB N="21" REF="19">
and &s;uper&s;tition, but to retard, if you can, their progre&s;s towards an oppo&s;ite and a wor&s;e extreme; and both in the&s;e, and in all other in&s;tances, to regulate the choice of your &s;ubjects, by the particular bias and tendency of opinion which you perceive already to pre|vail among&s;t your hearers, and by a con&s;ideration, not of the truth only, of what you deliver, which however mu&s;t always be an indi&s;pen&s;able condition, but of its effects, and tho&s;e not the effects which it would produce upon &s;ound, enlightened, and impartial judgments, but what are likely to take place in the weak and pre|occupied under&s;tandings with which we have to do.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the rule as it applies to the argument of our di&s;cour&s;es, in which its principal impor|tance con&s;i&s;ts, I proceed to illu&s;trate its u&s;e as it relates to another object&mdash;the means of exciting attention. The tran&s;ition from local to occa&s;ional &s;ermons is &s;o ea&s;y, and the rea&s;on for both is &s;o much the &s;ame, that what I have further to add will include the one as well as the other. And though nothing more be propo&s;ed in the few direc|tions which I am about to offer, than to move and awaken the attention of our audience, yet is this a purpo&s;e of no incon&s;iderable magnitude. We have great rea&s;on to complain of li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in our congregations. Whether
<PB N="22" REF="20">
this be their fault or ours, the fault of neither or of both, it is much to be de&s;ired that it could by any means be removed. Our &s;ermons are in general more informing, as well as more correct and cha&s;ti&s;ed both in matter and compo&s;ition, than tho&s;e of any denomination of di&s;&s;enting teachers. I wi&s;h it were in our power to ren|der them as impre&s;&s;ive as &s;ome of theirs &s;eem to be. Now I think we may ob&s;erve that we are heard with &s;ome|what more than ordinary advertency, whenever our di&s;|cour&s;es are recommended by any occa&s;ional propriety. The more therefore of the&s;e proprieties we contrive to weave into our preaching, the better. One which is very obvious, and which &s;hould never be neglected, is that of making our &s;ermons as &s;uitable as we can to the &s;ervice of the day. On the principal fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals of the church, the &s;ubjects which they are de&s;igned to commemorate, ought invariably to be made the &s;ubjects of our di&s;cour&s;es. Indeed the be&s;t &s;ermon, if it do not treat of the argument which the congregation come pre|pared to hear, is received with coldne&s;s, and with a &s;en&s;e of di&s;appointment. This re&s;pect to the order of public wor&s;hip almo&s;t every one pays. But the adaptation I ap|prehend may be carried much farther. Whenever any thing like an unity of &s;ubject is pur&s;ued throughout the
<PB N="23" REF="21">
collect, epi&s;tle, and go&s;pel of the day, that &s;ubject is with great advantage revived in the pulpit. It is per|haps to be wi&s;hed that this unity had been more con|&s;ulted in the compilation of this part of the liturgy than it has been. When from the want of it a &s;ubject is not di&s;tinctly pre&s;ented to us, there may however be &s;ome portion of the &s;ervice more &s;triking than the re&s;t, &s;ome in&s;tructive parable, &s;ome intere&s;ting narration, &s;ome con|ci&s;e but forcible precept, &s;ome pregnant &s;entence, which may be recalled to the hearers attention with peculiar effect. I think it no contemptible advantage if we even draw our text from the epi&s;tle or go&s;pel, or the p&s;alms or le&s;&s;ons. Our congregation will be more likely to re|tain what they hear from us, when it, in any manner, falls in with what they have been reading in their prayer books, or when they are afterwards reminded of it by reading the p&s;alms and le&s;&s;ons at home. But there is ano|ther &s;pecies of accommodation of more importance, and that is the choice of &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions, as may either meet the difficulties, or a&s;&s;i&s;t the reflections which are &s;ug|ge&s;ted by the portions of &s;cripture that are deli|vered from the reading de&s;k. Thus, whil&s;t the wars of Jo&s;hua and the Judges are related in the cour&s;e of the le&s;&s;ons which occupy &s;ome of the fir&s;t Sundays after Trinity, it will be very &s;ea&s;onable to explain the rea&s;ons
<PB N="24" REF="22">
upon which that di&s;pen&s;ation was founded, the moral and beneficial purpo&s;es which are declared to have been de&s;igned, and which were probably accompli&s;hed, by its execution, becau&s;e &s;uch an explanation will obviate the doubts concerning either the divine goodne&s;s or the cre|dibility of the narrative, which may ari&s;e in the mind of a hearer, who is not in&s;tructed to regard the tran&s;ac|tion, as a method of inflicting an exemplary, ju&s;t, and nece&s;&s;ary puni&s;hment. In like manner, whil&s;t the hi&s;|tory of the delivery of the law from Mount Sinai, or rather the recapitulation of that hi&s;tory by Mo&s;es, in the book of Deuteronomy, is carried on in the Sunday le&s;&s;ons which are read between Ea&s;ter and Whit&s;unday, we &s;hall be well engaged in di&s;cour&s;es upon the <HI>command|ments</HI> which &s;tand at the head of that in&s;titution, in &s;hewing from the hi&s;tory their high original and autho|rity, and in explaining their rea&s;onablene&s;s, application, and extent. Whil&s;t the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pre&s;ented to the congregation during the Sundays in Lent, we &s;hall be very negligent of the opportunity, if we do not take occa&s;ion to point out to our hearers, tho&s;e ob&s;ervations upon the benevolent but &s;ecret direction, the wi&s;e though circuitous mea&s;ures, of Providence, of which this beautiful pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture &s;upplies a train of ap|po&s;ite examples. There are, I doubt not, other &s;eries of
<PB N="25" REF="23">
&s;ubjects dictated by the &s;ervice as edifying as the&s;e; but the&s;e I propo&s;e as illu&s;trations of the rule.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;ervice of the church the &s;ea&s;on of the year may be made to &s;ugge&s;t u&s;eful and appropriate to|pics of meditation. The beginning of a new year has belonging to it a train of very &s;olemn reflections. In the devotional pieces of the late Dr. John&s;on this occa|&s;ion was never pa&s;&s;ed by. We may learn from the&s;e writings the proper u&s;e to be made of it; and by the example of that excellent per&s;on, how much a pious mind is wont to be affected by this memorial of the lap&s;e of life. There are al&s;o certain proprieties which cor|re&s;pond with the different parts of the year. For exam|ple, the wi&s;dom of God in the work of the creation is a theme which ought to be re&s;erved for the return of the &s;pring, when nature renews, as it were, her activity; when every animal is chearful and bu&s;y, and &s;eems to feel the influence of its Maker's kindne&s;s; when our &s;en&s;es and &s;pirits, the objects and enjoyments that &s;ur|round us, accord and harmonize with tho&s;e &s;entiments of delight and gratitude, which this &s;ubject, above all others, is calculated to in&s;pire. There is no devotion &s;o genuine as that which flows from the&s;e meditations, be|cau&s;e it is unforced and &s;elf-excited. There is no frame
<PB N="26" REF="24">
of mind more de&s;ireable, and con&s;equently, no preaching more u&s;eful, than that which leads the thought to this exerci&s;e. It is laying a foundation for Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf. If it be not to &s;ow the &s;eed, it is at lea&s;t to prepare the &s;oil. The evidence of revelation arrives with much greater ea&s;e at an under&s;tanding, which is already po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the per&s;ua&s;ion, that an un&s;een intelligence framed and conducts the univer&s;e; and which is accu&s;|tomed to refer the order and operations of nature to the agency of a &s;upreme will. The influence al&s;o of religion is almo&s;t always in proportion to the degree and &s;trength of this conviction. It is moreover a &s;pecies of in&s;truc|tion of which our hearers are more capable than we may at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;uppo&s;e. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to be a philo|&s;opher, or to be &s;killed in the names and di&s;tinctions of natural hi&s;tory, in order to perceive marks of contri|vance and de&s;ign in the creation. It is only to turn our ob&s;ervation to them. Now be&s;ide that this requires nei|ther more ability nor lei&s;ure than every man can com|mand, there are many things in the life of a country pari&s;hioner which will di&s;po&s;e his thoughts to the em|ployment. In his fields, amid&s;t his flocks, in the pro|gre&s;s of vegetation, the &s;tructure, faculties, and man|ners of dome&s;tic animals, he has con&s;tant occa&s;ion to re|mark
<PB N="27" REF="25">
proofs of intention and of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The mini&s;ter of a country pari&s;h is never therefore better engaged, than when he is a&s;&s;i&s;ting this turn of contem|plation. Nor will he ever do it with &s;o much effect, as when the appearance and face of external nature con&s;pire with the &s;entiments which he wi&s;hes to excite.</P>
<P>Again; if we would enlarge upon the various bounty of Providence, in furni&s;hing a regular &s;upply for animal, and e&s;pecially for human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, not by one, but by numerous and diver&s;ified &s;pecies of food and cloathing, we &s;hall be be&s;t heard in the time and amid&s;t the occupa|tions of harve&s;t, when our hearers are reaping the effects of tho&s;e contrivances for their &s;upport, and of that care for their pre&s;ervation, which their Father which is in Heaven hath exerci&s;ed for them. If the year has been favourable, we rejoice with them in the plenty which fills their granaries, covers their tables, and feeds their fami|lies. If otherwi&s;e, or le&s;s &s;o, we have &s;till to remark, how through all the hu&s;bandman's di&s;appointments, through the dangers and inclemencies of precarious &s;ea|&s;ons, a competent proportion of the fruits of the earth is conducted to its de&s;tined purpo&s;e. We may ob&s;erve al&s;o to the repining farmer, that the value, if not the exi&s;tence, of his own occupation, depends upon the very
<PB N="28" REF="26">
uncertainty of which he complains. It is found to be al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally true, that the partition of the profits between the owner and the occupier of the &s;oil, is in fa|vor of the latter, in proportion to the ri&s;k which he in|curs by the di&s;advantage of the climate. This is a very ju&s;t reflection, and particularly intelligible to a rural audience. We may add when the occa&s;ion requires it that &s;carcity it&s;elf hath its u&s;e. By acting as a &s;timulus to new exertions and to farther improvements, it often produces, through a temporary di&s;tre&s;s, a permanent benefit.</P>
<P>La&s;tly; &s;udden, violent, or untimely deaths, or death accompanied by any circum&s;tances of &s;urpri&s;e or &s;ingu|larity, u&s;ually leave an impre&s;&s;ion upon a whole neigh|bourhood. A Chri&s;tian teacher is wanting in attention to opportunities who does not avail him&s;elf of this im|pre&s;&s;ion. The uncertainty of life requires no proof. But the power and influence which this con&s;ideration &s;hall obtain over the deci&s;ions of the mind, will depend greatly upon the circum&s;tances under which it is pre|&s;ented to the imagination. Di&s;cour&s;es upon the &s;ubject come with tenfold force, when they are directed to a heart, already touched by &s;ome near, recent, and affect|ing example of human mortality. I do not lament that
<PB N="29" REF="27">
funeral &s;ermons are di&s;continued among&s;t us. They gene|rally contained &s;o much of un&s;ea&s;onable, and oftentimes unde&s;erved panegyric, that the hearers came away from them, rather with remarks in their mouths upon what was &s;aid of the decea&s;ed, than with any internal reflec|tions upon the &s;olemnity which they had left, or how nearly it related to their own condition. But by decent allu&s;ions in the &s;tated cour&s;e of our preaching to events of this &s;ort, or by, what is better, &s;uch a well-timed choice of our &s;ubject, as may lead our audience to make the allu&s;ion for them&s;elves, it is po&s;&s;ible, I think, to retain much of the good effect of funeral di&s;cour&s;es, without their adulation and without exciting vain curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>If other occurrences have ari&s;en within our neigh|bourhood, which &s;erve to exemplify the progre&s;s and fate of vice, the &s;olid advantages and ultimate &s;ucce&s;s of virtue, the providential di&s;covery of guilt or protection of innocence, the folly of avarice, the di&s;appointments of ambition, the vanity of worldly &s;chemes, the fallaciou&s;|ne&s;s of human fore&s;ight; in a word, which may remind us, "what &s;hadows we are, and what &s;hadows we pur|&s;ue," and thereby induce us to collect our views and en|deavours to one point, the attainment of final &s;alvation, &s;uch occurrences may be made to introduce topics of
<PB N="30" REF="28">
&s;erious and u&s;eful meditation. I have heard popular preachers among&s;t the methodi&s;ts avail them&s;elves of the&s;e occa&s;ions with very powerful effect. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that they frequently tran&s;gre&s;s the limits of decorum and propriety, and that the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions wound the mode&s;ty of a cultivated ear. But the me|thod it&s;elf is not to be blamed. Under the correction of a &s;ounder judgement it might be rendered very bene|ficial. Perhaps, as hath been already intimated, the &s;afe&s;t way is not to refer to the&s;e incidents by any direct allu|&s;ion, but merely to di&s;cour&s;e at the time upon &s;ubjects, which are allied to, and connected with them.</P>
<P>The &s;um of what I have been recommending amounts to this, that we con&s;ider diligently the probable effects of our di&s;cour&s;es, upon the particular characters and di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e who are to hear them; but that we apply this con&s;ideration &s;olely to the choice of truths, by no means to the admi&s;&s;ion of fal&s;ehood or in&s;incerity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;tinction fixes the limits of <HI>exoteric</HI> doctrine, as far as any thing called by that name is allowable to a Chri&s;tian teacher.</NOTE>: Secondly that we endeavour to profit by circum&s;tances, that is, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, not the rea&s;oning, but the efficacy of our di&s;cour&s;es, by an opportune and &s;kilful u&s;e of the &s;ervice of the church, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and of
<PB N="31" REF="29">
all &s;uch occurrences and &s;ituations as are capable of re|ceiving a religious turn, and &s;uch as, being yet recent in the memory of our hearers, may di&s;po&s;e their minds for the admi&s;&s;ion and influence of &s;alutary reflections.</P>
<P>MY REVEREND BRETHREN, I am &s;en&s;ible that the di&s;|cour&s;e with which I have now detained you, is not of that kind which is u&s;ually delivered at a Chancellor's vi&s;ita|tion. But &s;ince (by the favor of that excellent prelate, who by me mu&s;t long be remembered with gratitude and affection) I hold another public &s;tation in the Dio|ce&s;e, I embrace the only opportunity afforded me of &s;ubmitting to you that &s;pecies of council and exhorta|tion, which with more propriety perhaps you would have received from me in the character of your Arch|deacon, if the functions of that office had remained entire.</P>
