<HEAD>EPISTLE I. Of the Nature and State of Man with re&s;pect to the Univer&s;e.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Of</HI> Man <HI>in the</HI> Ab&s;tract. <HI>We can judge only with regard to our</HI> own Sy&s;tem, <HI>being ignorant of the</HI> Relations <HI>of Sy&s;tems and Things,</HI> VERSE 17, <HI>&amp;c. Man is not therefore to be deem'd</HI> Im|perfect, <HI>but a Being &s;uited to his Place and Rank in the Crea|tion, agreeable to the</HI> General Order <HI>of Things, and conformable to</HI> Ends <HI>and</HI> Relations <HI>to Him unknown,</HI> 35, <HI>&amp;c. It is partly upon this</HI> Ignorance <HI>of future Events, and partly upon the</HI> Hope <HI>of a Future State, that all his Happine&s;s in the Pre&s;ent depends,</HI> 73, <HI>&amp;c. His</HI> Pride, <HI>in aiming at more</HI> Knowledge, <HI>and pretend|ing to more</HI> Perfection, <HI>the Cau&s;e of his Error and Mi&s;ery,</HI> 120. <HI>The</HI> Impiety <HI>of putting him&s;elf in the Place of</HI> God, <HI>and judging of the Fitne&s;s or Unfitne&s;s, Perfection or Imperfection, Ju&s;tice or Inju&s;tice, of His Di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> 109. <HI>The</HI> Ab&s;urdity <HI>of conceiting him&s;elf the</HI> Final Cau&s;e <HI>of the Creation, or expect|ing that Perfection in the</HI> Moral <HI>World which is not in the</HI> Na|tural, 127 <HI>to</HI> 164. <HI>The</HI> Unrea&s;onablene&s;s <HI>of his Complaints again&s;t Providence, while on the one Hand he demands the Per|fections of the</HI> Angels, <HI>on the other the bodily Qualifications of the</HI> Brutes, 165. <HI>That the Gift of</HI> Rea&s;on alone <HI>countervails all the latter, and that to po&s;&s;e&s;s any of the</HI> Sen&s;itive Faculties <HI>in a higher Degree, would render him mi&s;erable,</HI> 181, 221. <HI>That throughout the whole vi&s;ible World, an Univer&s;al</HI> Order <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Gradation <HI>in the&s;e is ob&s;erv'd, which cau&s;es a</HI> Subordination <HI>of Creature to Creature, and of all Creatures to Man. The Grada|tions of</HI> Sen&s;e, In&s;tinct, Thought, Reflection, Rea&s;on, 199, <HI>to</HI> 124. <HI>How much</HI> farther <HI>this Order and Subordination of living Creatures may extend, above and below us?</HI> 225. <HI>Were any</HI> Part <HI>of this broken, not that Part only, but the</HI> Whole <HI>connected</HI> Cre|ation <HI>mu&s;t be de&s;troyed. The Extravagance, Madne&s;s, and Pride of &s;uch a De&s;ire,</HI> 239, <HI>&amp;c. Con&s;equently, the ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion due to Providence, both as to our</HI> Pre&s;ent <HI>and</HI> Future <HI>State,</HI> 269. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<L>And catch the Manners living as they ri&s;e;</L>
<L N="15">Laugh where we <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> be candid where we <HI>can,</HI></L>
<L>But vindicate the Ways of <HI>God</HI> to Man.</L>

<L>Of Sy&s;tems po&s;&s;ible, if 'tis confe&s;t</L>

<L N="45">Where all mu&s;t <HI>full</HI> or not <HI>coherent</HI> be,</L>

That</HI> external Goods <HI>are not the proper Rewards, often incon&s;i&s;tent with, or de&s;tructive of</HI> Vir|tue, 166. <HI>But that even the&s;e can make no Man happy without Virtue.

That</HI> VIRTUR ONLY <HI>con&s;titutes a Happine&s;s, who&s;e Object is</HI> univer&s;al, 311. <HI>and who&s;e Pro&s;pect</HI> eternal, 345. <HI>The Perfection of which con&s;i&s;ts in a</HI> Conformity <HI>to the</HI> Order <HI>of</HI> Providence, <HI>here, and in a</HI> Re&s;ignation <HI>to it, here and hereaf|ter,</HI> 534. <HI>Or (in other Words) in</HI> Love <HI>of</HI> God, <HI>and</HI> Charity <HI>to</HI> all Men. <HI>&amp;c to the End.</HI></P>
