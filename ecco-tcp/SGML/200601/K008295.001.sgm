<P>THE difficulty of the fir&s;t addre&s;s on any new occa&s;ion, is felt by every man in his tran&s;actions with the world, and confe&s;&s;ed by the &s;ettled and regular forms of &s;alutation which nece&s;&s;ity has intro|duced into all languages. Judgment was wearied with the inextricable perplexity of being forced upon choice, where there was no motive to preference; and it was found convenient that &s;ome ea&s;y method of intro|duction &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which, if it wanted the allurement of novelty, might enjoy in its place the &s;ecurity of pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>PERHAPS few authors have pre&s;ented them|&s;elves
<PB N="2" REF="3">
before the publick, without wi&s;hing that &s;uch ceremonial modes of entrance had been anciently e&s;tabli&s;hed, as might have freed them from the dangers which the too ardent de&s;ire of plea&s;ing is certain to produce, and procluded the vain expedients of &s;oftening cen&s;ure by apologies, and rou&s;ing attention by abruptne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE epic writers, indeed, have found the proemial part of the poem &s;uch an addition to their laborious undertaking, that they have almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly adopted the fir&s;t lines of Homer, and the reader needs only be informed of the &s;ubject to know in what manner the &s;cene will open.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;olemn repetition is hitherto the peculiar di&s;tinction of heroic poetry, and has never been legally extended to the lower or|ders of literature, but &s;eems to be con&s;idered as an hereditary privilege, to be enjoyed only by tho&s;e who can claim it from their alliance to the genius of Homer.</P>
<P>THE rules which an ob&s;ervation of the injudicious u&s;e of this prerogative &s;ugge&s;ted to Horace may, indeed, be applied to the di|rection
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of candidates for inferior fame; and it may be proper for all to remember, that they ought not to rai&s;e expectation which it is not in their power to &s;atisfy, and that it is more plea&s;ing to &s;ee &s;moke gradually brightening into flame, than flame &s;inking into &s;moke.</P>
<P>YET tho' this precept has been long recei|ved, both from regard to the authority of him that delivered it, and its conformity to the general opinion of the world, there have been &s;ome, as well &s;ince as before his time, who have thought it no deviation from mode&s;ty to recommend their own labours, and imagined them&s;elves entitled by indi&s;putable merit to an exemption from general re&s;traints, and to elevations not allowed in common life. They, perhaps, believed that when, like Thucydides, they bequeathed to mankind <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>an e&s;tate for ever,</HI> it was an additional favour to inform them of its value.</P>
<P>IT may, indeed, be no le&s;s dangerous to claim, on certain occa&s;ions, too little than too much. There is &s;omething captivating in &s;pirit and intrepidity, to which we often yield, as to a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s power; nor can he rea&s;onably expect
<PB N="4" REF="5">
the confidence of others, who, too apparently, di&s;tru&s;ts him&s;elf.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH, in his enumeration of the various occa&s;ions, on which a man may, without ju&s;t offence, proclaim his own excellencies, has omitted the ca&s;e of an author entering the world; unle&s;s it may be comprehended under his general po&s;ition, that a man may lawfully prai&s;e him&s;elf for tho&s;e qualities which cannot be known but from his own mouth; as when he is among &s;trangers, and can probably have no opportunity of an actual exertion of his powers. That the ca&s;e of an author is pa|rallel will &s;carecely be granted, becau&s;e he ne|ce&s;&s;arily di&s;covers the degree of his merit to his judges, when he &s;olicits their &s;uffrages. But it &s;hould be remembered, that unle&s;s his judges be prejudiced in his favour, they will not be per&s;uaded to hear the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>IN love, the &s;tate which fills the heart with a degree of &s;olicitude next that of an author, it has been held a maxim, that &s;ucce&s;s is mo&s;t ea&s;ily obtained by indirect and concealed approaches; he who too &s;oon profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf a lover, rai&s;es ob&s;tacles to his own wi&s;hes and tho&s;e whom di&s;appointments have taught
<PB N="5" REF="6">
experience, endeavour to conceal their pa&s;&s;ion till they believe that their mi&s;tre&s;s wi&s;hes for the di&s;covery. The &s;ame method, if it were practicable to writers, would &s;ave many com|plaints of the partiality of the world, the &s;everity of the age, and the caprices of critici&s;m. If a man could glide imperceptibly into the favour of the publick, and only proclaim his preten&s;ions to literary honours when he is &s;ure of not being rejected, he might commence author with better hopes, as his failings might e&s;cape contempt, though he &s;hall never attain excellence &s;ufficient to excite much regard.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince the publick &s;uppo&s;es every man that writes ambitious of applau&s;e, as &s;ome ladies have taught them&s;elves to believe that every man intends love, who expre&s;&s;es civility, the mi&s;carrige of any new endeavour in learn|ing rai&s;es an unbounded contempt, indulged by mo&s;t minds without &s;cruple, as an hone&s;t triumph over unju&s;t claims, and exorbitant expectations. The arti&s;ices of tho&s;e who put them&s;elves in this hazardous &s;tate, have there|fore been multiplied in proportion to their fear as well as their ambition; and are to be looked upon with more indulgence, as they re&s;ult from complicated pa&s;&s;ions, and are inci|ted
<PB N="6" REF="7">
at once by the two great movers of the human mind, the de&s;ire of good, and the fear of evil. For who can wonder that, thus allured on one &s;ide, and frightned on the other, &s;ome men &s;hould endeavour to gain favour by bribing the judge with an appearance of re&s;pect which they do not feel, to excite compa&s;&s;ion by confe&s;&s;ing weakne&s;s of which they are not convinced, or to attract regard by a &s;hew of openne&s;s and magnanimity, by a daring profe&s;&s;ion of their own de&s;erts, and a publick challenge of ho|nours and rewards.</P>
<P>THE o&s;tentatious and haughty di&s;play of them&s;elves has been the u&s;ual refuge of diurnal writers, in vindication of who&s;e practice it may be &s;aid, that what it wants in prudence is &s;upplied by &s;incerity, and who at lea&s;t may plead, that if their boa&s;ts deceive any into the peru&s;al of their performances, they defraud them of but little time. <Q><L>&mdash;Quid enim? Concurritur&mdash;horae</L>
<L>Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.</L></Q> The que&s;tion concerning the merit of the day is &s;oon decided, and we are not condem|ned
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to toil thro' half a folio, to be convinced that the writer has broke his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is one among many rea&s;ons for which I purpo&s;e to endeavour the entertainment of my countrymen by a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay on Tue&s;day and Saturday, that I hope not much to tire tho&s;e whom I &s;hall not happen to plea&s;e; and if I am not commended for the beauty of my works, to be at lea&s;t pardoned for their brevity: but whether my expectations are mo&s;t fixed on pardon or prai&s;e, I think it not nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover; for having accurately weighed the rea&s;ons for arrogance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I find them &s;o nearly equiponderant, that my impati|ence to try the event of my fir&s;t performance will not &s;uffer me to attend any longer the trepidation of the balance.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, many conveniencies al|mo&s;t peculiar to this method of publication, which may naturally flatter the author, whe|ther he be confident or timorous. The man to whom the extent of his knowledge, or the &s;prightline&s;s of his imagination, has, in his own opinion, already &s;ecured the prai&s;es of the world, willingly takes that way of di&s;playing his abilities which will &s;oone&s;t give him an op|portunity
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of hearing the voice of fame, and it heightens his alacrity to think in how many places he &s;hall hear what he is now writing, read with ec&s;ta&s;ies to morrow. He will often plea&s;e him&s;elf with reflecting, that the author of a large treati&s;e mu&s;t proceed with anxiety, le&s;t, before the completion of his work, the attention of the publick may have changed its object; but that he who is confined to no &s;ingle &s;ubject, may follow the national ta&s;te through all its variations, and catch the Aura popularis, the gale of favour, from what point &s;oever it &s;hall blow.</P>
<P>NOR is the pro&s;pect le&s;s likely to ea&s;e the doubts of the cautious, and allay the terrours of the fearful, for to &s;uch the &s;hortne&s;s of every &s;ingle paper is a powerful encouragement. He that que&s;tions his abilities to arrange the di&s;&s;i|milar parts of an exten&s;ive plan, or fears to be lo&s;t in a complicated &s;y&s;tem, may yet hope to adju&s;t a few pages without perplexity; and if, when he turns over the repo&s;itories of his me|mory, he finds his collection too &s;mall for a volume, he may yet have enough to furni&s;h out an e&s;&s;ay. He that is afraid of laying out too much time upon an experiment of which he fears the event, per&s;uades him&s;elf that a few
<PB N="9" REF="10">
days will &s;hew him what he is to expect from his learning and his genius. If he thinks his own judgment not &s;ufficiently enlightned, he may, by attending the remarks which every paper will produce, inform him&s;elf of his mi&s;|takes, rectify his opinions, and extend his views. If he &s;u&s;pects that he may with too little premeditation encumber him&s;elf by an un|wieldy &s;ubject, he may quit it without con|fe&s;&s;ing his ignorance, and pa&s;s to other topicks le&s;s dangerous, or more tractable. And if he finds, with all his indu&s;try, and all his artifi|ces, that he cannot de&s;erve regard, or cannot attain it, he may let the de&s;ign fall at once, and, without injury to others or him&s;elf, retire to amu&s;ements of greater plea&s;ure, or to &s;tudies of better pro&s;pect.</P>

<P>THAT the mind of man is never &s;a|tisfied with the objects before it, but is always breaking away from the pre&s;ent mo|ment, and lo&s;ing it&s;elf in &s;chemes of future &s;elicity; that we forget the proper u&s;e of the time now in our power, to provide for the enjoyment of that which, perhaps, may never be granted us, has been frequently re|marked; and as this practice is a very com|modious &s;ubject of raillery to the gay, and of declamation to the &s;erious, it has been ridi|culed with all the plea&s;antry of wit, and ex|aggerated with all the amplifications of rheto|ric. Every in&s;tance, by which its ab&s;urdity might appear mo&s;t flagrant, has been &s;tudiou&s;ly collected; it has been marked with every epithet of contempt, and all the tropes and figures have been called forth again&s;t it.</P>
<P>CENSURE is willingly indulged, becau&s;e it
<PB N="11" REF="12">
always implies &s;ome &s;uperiority; men plea&s;e them&s;elves with imagining that they have made a deeper &s;earch, or wider &s;urvey, than others, and detected faults and follies, which e&s;caped vulgar ob&s;ervation. And the plea&s;ure of wantoning in common topicks is &s;o tempt|ing to a writer, that he cannot ea&s;ily re&s;ign it; a train of &s;entiments generally received enables him to &s;hine without labour, and to conquer without a conte&s;t. It is &s;o ea&s;y to laugh at the folly of him who lives only in idea, refu&s;es immediate ea&s;e or di&s;tant plea&s;ures, and, in&s;tead of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of life, lets life glide away in preparations to enjoy them; it affords &s;uch opportunities of trium|phant exultations, to exemplify the uncer|tainty of human &s;tate, to rou&s;e mortals from their dream, and inform them of the &s;ilent celerity of time, that we may rea&s;onably be|lieve mo&s;t authors willing rather to tran&s;mit than examine &s;o advantageous a principle, and more inclined to pur&s;ue a track &s;o &s;mooth and &s;o flowery, than attentively to con&s;ider whether it leads to truth.</P>
<P>THIS quality of looking forward into futu|rity &s;eems the unavoidable and nece&s;&s;ary con|dition
<PB N="12" REF="13">
of a being, who&s;e motions are gradual, and who&s;e life is progre&s;&s;ive: as his powers are limited, he mu&s;t u&s;e means for the attain|ment of his ends, and mu&s;t intend fir&s;t what he performs la&s;t; as, by continual advances from his fir&s;t &s;tage of exi&s;tence, he is perpetu|ally varying the horizon of his pro&s;pects, he mu&s;t always di&s;cover new motives of action, new excitements of fear, and allurements of de&s;ire.</P>
<P>THE end, therefore, which, at pre&s;ent, calls forth our efforts will be found, when it is once gained, to be only one of the means to &s;ome remoter end, and the natural flights of the human mind are not from plea&s;ure to plea|&s;ure, but from hope to hope.</P>
<P>HE that directs his &s;teps to a certain point, mu&s;t frequently turn his eyes to that place which he &s;trives to reach; he that undergoes the fatigue of labour, mu&s;t &s;olace his weari|ne&s;s with the contemplation of its reward. In agriculture, one of the mo&s;t &s;imple and nece&s;|&s;ary employments, no man turns up the ground but becau&s;e he thinks of the harve&s;t, that har|ve&s;t which blights may intercept, which inun|dations
<PB N="13" REF="14">
may &s;weep away, or which death or calamity may hinder him from reaping.</P>
<P>YET as few maxims are widely received, or long retained, but for &s;ome conformity with truth and nature, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this caution again&s;t keeping our view too intent upon remote advantages is not without its propriety or u&s;efulne&s;s, though it may have been inclucated with too much levity, or in|forced with too little di&s;tinction: for, not to &s;peak of that vehemence of de&s;ire which pre&s;&s;es through right and wrong to its gratification, or that anxious inquietude which is ju&s;tly chargeable with di&s;tru&s;t of heaven, &s;ubjects too &s;olemn for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; it very frequently happens that, by indulging too early the raptures of &s;ucce&s;s, we forget the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure it, and &s;uffer the imagination to riot in the fruition of &s;ome po&s;&s;ible good, till the time of obtaining it has &s;lipped away.</P>
<P>THERE would however, perhaps, be few enterpri&s;es, either of great labour or hazard, undertaken, if we had not the power of mag|nifying the advantages, which we per&s;uade
<PB N="14" REF="15">
our&s;elves to expect from them; and when the knight of La Mancha gravely recounts to his companion the adventures by which he is to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner that he &s;hall be &s;ummoned to the &s;upport of empires, &s;ollicited to accept the heire&s;s of the crown he has pre&s;erved, have honours and riches to &s;catter about him, and an i&s;land to be&s;tow on his worthy &s;quire, very few readers, amid&s;t their mirth or their pity, can deny that they have admitted vi&s;ions of the &s;ame kind; though they have not, perhaps, expected e|vents equally &s;trange, nor by means equally inadequate. When we pity him, we reflect on our own di&s;appointments, and when we laugh, our hearts inform us that he is not more ridiculous than our&s;elves, except that he tells what we only thought.</P>
<P>THE under&s;tanding of a man, naturally &s;anguine, may, indeed, be ea&s;ily vitiated by too luxurious an indulgence of the plea&s;ures of hope, however generally nece&s;&s;ary to the production of every thing great or excellent, as &s;ome plants are de&s;troyed by too open ex|po&s;ure to that &s;un which gives life and beauty to the vegetable world.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
PERHAPS no cla&s;s of the human &s;pecies requires more to be cautioned again&s;t this an|ticipation of happine&s;s, than tho&s;e that a&s;pire to the name of authors. A man of lively fancy no &s;ooner finds a hint moving in his mind, than he makes momentaneous excur|&s;ions to the pre&s;s, and to the world, and, with a little encouragement from flattery, pu&s;hes forward into future ages, and progno&s;ticates the honours to be paid him, when envy is ex|tinct, and faction is forgotten, and tho&s;e, whom the partiality of the pre&s;ent generation &s;uffers to ob&s;cure him, &s;hall give way to other trifles of as &s;hort duration as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THOSE, who have proceeded &s;o far as to appeal to the tribunal of &s;ucceeding times, are, indeed, not likely to be cured of their infatuation; but all endeavours ought to be u&s;ed for the prevention of a di&s;ea&s;e, for which, when it has attained its height, per|haps no remedy will be found in the gardens of philo&s;ophy, however &s;he may boa&s;t her phy&s;ick of the mind, her catharticks of vice, or her antidotes to pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I SHALL, therefore, while I am yet but lightly touched with the &s;ymptoms of the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
writer's malady, endeavour to fortify my&s;elf again&s;t the infection, not without &s;ome weak hope, that my pre&s;ervatives may extend their virtue to others, who&s;e employment expo&s;es them to the &s;ame danger: <Q><L>Laudis amore tumes? Sunt certa piacula, quae te</L>
<L>Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is the &s;age advice of Epictetus, that a man &s;hould accu&s;tom him&s;elf often to think of what is mo&s;t &s;hocking and terrible, that by &s;uch reflexions he may be pre&s;erved from too ardent wi&s;hes for &s;eeming good, and from too much dejection in real evil.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more dreadful to an author than neglect, compared with which re|proach, and hatred, and oppo&s;ition, are names of happine&s;s; yet this wor&s;t, this meane&s;t fate every man who dares to write has rea&s;on to fear. <Q>I nunc, et ver&s;us tecum meditare canoros.</Q></P>
<P>IT may not be unfit for him who makes a new entrance into the lettered world, &s;o far to &s;u&s;pect his own powers as to believe that he po&s;&s;ibly may de&s;erve neglect; that nature may
<PB N="17" REF="18">
not have qualified him much to enlarge or embelli&s;h knowledge, nor &s;ent him forth en|titled by indi&s;putable &s;uperiority to regulate the conduct of the re&s;t of mankind; that, though the world mu&s;t be granted to be yet in ignorance, he is not de&s;tined to di&s;pel the cloud, nor to &s;hine out as one of the lumi|naries of life: for this &s;u&s;picion, every cata|logue of authors will furni&s;h &s;ufficient rea&s;on; as he will find it crouded with names of men, who, though now forgotten, were once no le&s;s enterpri&s;ing or confident than him&s;elf, equally plea&s;ed with their own productions, equally care&s;&s;ed by their patrons, and flattered by their friends.</P>
<P>BUT, though it &s;hould happen that an au|thor is capable of excelling in his province; yet his merit may pa&s;s without notice, hud|dled in the variety of things, and thrown into the general mi&s;cellany of life. He that en|deavours after fame by writing, &s;olicits the regard of a multitude fluctuating in plea&s;ures, or immer&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s, without time for intellectual amu&s;ements; he appeals to judges prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ions, or corrupted by pre|judices, which preclude their approbation of any new performance. Some are too indolent
<PB N="18" REF="19">
to read any thing, till its reputation is e&s;tab|li&s;h'd; others too envious to promote that fame, which gives them pain by its increa&s;e. What is new is oppo&s;ed, becau&s;e mo&s;t are un|willing to be taught; and what is known is rejected, becau&s;e it is not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider|ed, that men more frequently require to be reminded than informed. The learned are afraid to declare their opinion early, le&s;t they &s;hould put their reputation in hazard; the ig|norant always imagine them&s;elves giving &s;ome proof of delicacy, when they refu&s;e to be plea&s;ed: and he, therefore, that finds his way to reputation, through all the&s;e ob&s;tructi|ons, mu&s;t acknowledge that he is indebted to other cau&s;es be&s;ides his indu&s;try, his learning, or his wit.</P>

<P>THE ta&s;k of an author is, either to teach what is not known, or to re|commend known truths, by his manner of adorning them; either to let new light in up|on the mind, and open new &s;cenes to the pro&s;pect, or to vary the dre&s;s and &s;ituation of common objects, &s;o as to give them fre&s;h grace and more powerful attractions, to &s;pread &s;uch flowers over the regions through which the intellect has already made its progre&s;s, as may tempt it to return, and take a &s;econd view of things too ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed over, or too negligent|ly regarded.</P>
<P>EITHER of the&s;e labours is very difficult, becau&s;e, that they may not be fruitle&s;s, men mu&s;t not only be per&s;uaded of their errors, but reconciled to their guide; they mu&s;t not only confe&s;s their ignorance, but, what is &s;till le&s;s plea&s;ing, mu&s;t allow that he from whom they
<PB N="20" REF="21">
are to learn is more knowing than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT might be imagined that &s;uch an employ|ment was in it&s;elf &s;ufficiently irk&s;ome and hazardous, and that none would be found &s;o malevolent as wantonly to add weight to the &s;tone of Si&s;yphus. It might be hoped that few endeavours would be u&s;ed to ob&s;truct tho&s;e advances to reputation, which mu&s;t be made at &s;uch an expence of time and thought, and by &s;uch &s;low degrees, with &s;o great hazard in the mi&s;carriage, and with &s;o little advantage from the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>YET there is a certain race of men, that either imagine it their duty, or make it their amu&s;ement, to hinder the reception of every work of learning or of genius, who &s;tand as centinels in the avenues of fame, and value them&s;elves upon giving IGNORANCE and ENVY the fir&s;t notice of a new prey.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e men, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the appellation of CRITICKS, it is nece&s;|&s;ary for a new author to find &s;ome means of recommendation. It is probable, that the mo&s;t malignant of the&s;e per&s;ecutors might be &s;omewhat &s;oftened, and prevailed on, for a
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;hort time, to remit their fury. For this pur|po&s;e, having con&s;idered many expedients, I find in the records of ancient times, that ARGUS was lulled by mu&s;ic, and CERBERUS quieted with a &s;op; and am, therefore, inclin|ed to believe that modern criticks, who, if they have not the eyes, have the watchfulne&s;s of ARGUS, and can bark as loud as CERBE|RUS, though, perhaps, they may not bite with equal force, might be &s;ubdued by methods of the &s;ame kind. I have heard how &s;ome have been pacified with claret and a &s;upper, and o|thers laid a&s;leep by the &s;oft notes of flattery.</P>
<P>THOUGH the nature of my undertaking gives me &s;ufficient rea&s;on to dread the united attacks of this virulent generation, yet I have not hitherto per&s;uaded my&s;elf to take any mea&s;ures for flight or treaty. For I am in doubt, whether they can act again&s;t me by lawful authority, whether they have not pre|&s;umed upon a forged commi&s;&s;ion, &s;tiled them|&s;elves the mini&s;ters of CRITICISM, without being able to produce any authentic evidence of delegation, and uttered their own determi|nations as the decrees of a higher judicature.</P>
<P>CRITICISM, from whom they derive their
<PB N="22" REF="23">
claim to decide the fate of writers, was the elde&s;t daughter of LABOUR and of TRUTH: &s;he was, at her birth, committed to the care of JUSTICE, and brought up by her in the palace of WISDOM. Being &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the cele&s;tials, for her uncommon qualities, &s;he was appointed the governe&s;s of FANCY, and impowered to beat time to the chorus of the MUSES, when they &s;ung before the throne of JUPITER.</P>
<P>WHEN the MUSES conde&s;cended to vi&s;it this lower world, they came accompanied by CRITICISM, to whom, upon her de&s;cent from her native regions, JUSTICE gave a &s;cepter, to be carried aloft in her right hand, one end of which was tinctured with ambro&s;ia, and in|wreathed with a golden foliage of amaranths and bays; the other end was incircled with cypre&s;s and poppies, and dipped in the waters of oblivion. In her left hand, &s;he bore an unextingui&s;hable torch, the manufacture of LABOUR, and lighted by TRUTH, of which it was the particular quality to diffu&s;e its radi|ance in &s;uch a manner as immediately to &s;hew every thing in its true form, however it might be di&s;gui&s;ed to common eyes. Whatever ART could complicate, or FOLLY could con|found,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
was, upon the fir&s;t gleam of the torch of TRUTH, exhibited in its di&s;tinct parts and original &s;implicity; it darted through all the labyrinths of &s;ophi&s;try, and &s;hewed at once all the ab&s;urdities to which they &s;erved for refuge; it pierced through the robes, which rheto|rick often &s;old to fal&s;ehood, and detected the di&s;proportion of parts, which artificial veils had been contrived to cover.</P>
<P>THUS furni&s;hed for the execution of her office, CRITICISM camedown to &s;urvey the per|formances of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the votaries of the MUSES. Whatever was brought before her, &s;he beheld by the &s;teady light of the torch of TRUTH, and when her exami|nation had convinced her, that the laws of ju&s;t writing had been ob&s;erved, &s;he touched it with the amaranthine end of the &s;cepter, and con&s;igned it over to immortality.</P>
<P>BUT it more frequently happened, that in the works, which required her in&s;pection, there was &s;ome impo&s;ture attempted; that fal&s;e colours were laboriou&s;ly laid upon par|ticular parts; that &s;ome &s;ecret inequality was &s;ound between the words and &s;entiments, or &s;ome di&s;&s;imilitude of the ideas and the original
<PB N="24" REF="25">
objects; that incongruities were linked together, or that &s;ome parts were of no u&s;e but to en|large the appearance of the whole, without contributing to its beauty, its &s;olidity, or its u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEREVER &s;uch di&s;coveries were made, and they were made whenever the&s;e faults were committed, CRITICISM refu&s;ed the touch which conferred the &s;anction of immor|tality, and, when the errors were frequent and gro&s;s, rever&s;ed the &s;cepter, and let the drops of Lethe di&s;til from the poppies and cypre&s;s, a fatal mildew, which immediately began to wa&s;te the work away, till it was at la&s;t totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THERE were frequently &s;ome compo&s;itions brought to the te&s;t, in which, when the &s;tronge&s;t light was thrown upon them, their beauties and faults appeared &s;o equally mingled, that CRTICISM &s;tood with her &s;cepter poi&s;ed in her hand, in doubt whether to &s;hed the drops of oblivion, or ambro&s;ia, upon them. The&s;e, at la&s;t, increa&s;ed to &s;o great a number, that &s;he was weary of attending &s;uch doubtful claims, and, for fear of u&s;ing improperly the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
&s;cepter of JUSTICE, referred the cau&s;e to be con&s;idered by TIME.</P>
<P>THE proceedings of TIME, though very dilatory, were, &s;ome few caprices excepted, conformable to JUSTICE: and many, who thought them&s;elves &s;ecure by a &s;hort forbear|ance, have &s;unk under his &s;cythe, as they were po&s;ting down with their volumes in tri|umph to futurity. It was ob&s;ervable that &s;ome were de&s;troyed by little and little, and others cru&s;hed for ever by a &s;ingle blow.</P>
<P>CRITICISM having long kept her eye fixt &s;teadily upon TIME, was at la&s;t &s;o well &s;atis|fied with his conduct, that &s;he withdrew from the earth with her patrone&s;s ASTREA, and left PREJUDICE and FALSE-TASTE to ravage at large with FRAUD and MISCHIEF; content|ing her&s;elf thenceforth to &s;hed her influence from afar upon &s;ome &s;elect minds, &s;itted for its reception by learning and by virtue.</P>
<P>BEFORE her departure, &s;he broke her &s;cepter, of which the &s;hivers, that formed the ambro&s;ial end, were caught up by FLATTERY, and tho&s;e that had been infected with the waters of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, with equal ha&s;te, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> by MA|LEVOLENCE.
<PB N="26" REF="27">
The followers of FLATTERY, to whom &s;he di&s;tributed her part of the &s;cepter, neither had nor de&s;ired light, but touched in|di&s;criminately whatever POWER or INTEREST happened to exhibit. The companions of MALEVOLENCE were &s;upplied by the FURIES with a torch, which had this quality peculiar to infernal lu&s;tre, that its light fell only upon faults. <Q><L>No light, but rather darkne&s;s vi&s;ible</L>
<L>Serv'd only to di&s;cover &s;ights of woe.</L></Q></P>
<P>WITH the&s;e fragments of authority, the &s;laves of FLATTERY and MALEVOLENCE marched out, at the command of their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, to confer immortality, or condemn to oblivion. But the &s;cepter had now lo&s;t its power; and TIME pa&s;&s;es his &s;entence at lei&s;ure, without any regard to their determinations.</P>

<P>THE works of fiction, with which the pre&s;ent generation &s;eems more parti|cularly delighted, are &s;uch as exhibit life in its true &s;tate, diver&s;ified only by the accidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and qualities which are really to be found in conver&s;ing with mankind.</P>
<P>THIS kind of writing may be termed not im|properly the comedy of romance, and is to be conducted nearly by the rules of comic poetry Its province is to bring about natural event|by ea&s;y means, and to keep up curio&s;ity with|out the help of wonder: it is therefore preclu|ded from the machines and expedients of the heroic romance, and can neither employ giants to &s;natch away a lady from the nuptial rites, nor knights to bring her back from captivity; it can neither bewilder its per&s;onages in de&s;arts, nor lodge them in imaginary ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER a remark made by Scaliger upon Pontanus, that all his writings are filled
<PB N="28" REF="29">
with the &s;ame images; and that if you take from him his lillies and his ro&s;es, his &s;atyrs and his dryads, he will have nothing left that can be called poetry. In like manner, almo&s;t all the fictions of the la&s;t age will vani&s;h, if you deprive them of a hermit and a wood, a battle and a &s;hipwreek.</P>
<P>WHY this wild &s;train of imagination found reception &s;o long, in polite and learned ages, it is not ea&s;y to conceive; but we cannot wonder that, while readers could be procured, the authors were willing to continue it: for when a man had by practice gained &s;ome fluency of language, he had no farther care than to retire to his clo&s;et, let loo&s;e his inventi|on, and heat his mind with incredibilities; and a book was produced without fear of cri|tici&s;m, without the toil of &s;tudy, without knowledge of nature, or acquaintance with life.</P>
<P>THE ta&s;k of our pre&s;ent writers is very dif|ferent; it requires, together with that learning which is to be gained from books, that expe|rience which can never be attained by &s;olitary diligence, but mu&s;t ari&s;e from general conver&s;e, and accurate ob&s;ervation of the living world. Their performances have, as Horace expre&s;&s;es
<PB N="29" REF="30">
it, <HI>plus oneris quantum veniae minus,</HI> little indul|gence, and therefore more difficulty. They are engaged in portraits of which every one knows the original, and can therefore detect any deviation from exactne&s;s of re&s;emblance. Other writings are &s;afe, except from the malice of learning, but the&s;e are in danger from every common reader; as the &s;lipper ill executed was cen&s;ured by a &s;hoemaker who happened to &s;top in his way at the Venus of Apelles.</P>
<P>BUT the danger of not being approved as ju&s;t copyers of human manners, is not the mo&s;t important apprehen&s;ion that an author of this &s;ort ought to have before him. The&s;e books are writen chiefly to the young, the ig|norant, and the idle, to whom they &s;erve as lectures of conduct, and introductions into life. They are the entertainment of minds unfurni&s;hed with ideas, and therefore ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions; not fixed by princi|ples, and therefore ea&s;ily following the current of fancy; not informed by experience, and con&s;equently open to every fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion and partial account.</P>
<P>THAT the highe&s;t degree of reverence &s;hould be paid to youth, and that nothing in|decent
<PB N="30" REF="31">
or un&s;eemly &s;hould be &s;uffered to ap|proach their eyes or ears; are precepts extorted by &s;en&s;e and virtue from an ancient writer, by no means eminent for cha&s;tity of thought. The &s;ame kind, tho' not the &s;ame degree of caution, is required in every thing which is laid before them, to &s;ecure them from unju&s;t prejudices, perver&s;e opinions, and improper combinations of images.</P>
<P>IN the romances formerly written, every tran&s;action and &s;entiment was &s;o remote from all that pa&s;&s;es among men, that the reader was in very little danger of making any applicati|ons to him&s;elf; the virtues and crimes were equally beyond his &s;phere of activity; and he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with heroes and with traitors, deliverers and per&s;ecutors, as with beings of another &s;pecies, who&s;e actions were regulated upon motives of their own, and who had nei|ther faults nor excellencies in common with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT when an adventurer is levelled with the re&s;t of the world, and acts in &s;uch &s;cenes of the univer&s;al drama, as may be the lot of any other man; young &s;pectators fix their eyes upon him with clo&s;er attention, and hope by
<PB N="31" REF="32">
ob&s;erving his behaviour and &s;ucce&s;s to regu|late their own practices, when they &s;hall be engaged in the like part.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on the&s;e familiar hi&s;tories may perhaps be made of greater u&s;e than the &s;olem|nities of profe&s;&s;ed morality, and convey the knowledge of vice and virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions. But if the power of example is &s;o great, as to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the memory by a kind of violence, and pro|duce effects almo&s;t without the intervention of the will, care ought to be taken that, when the choice is unre&s;trained, the be&s;t examples only &s;hould be exhibited; and that which is likely to operate &s;o &s;trongly, &s;hould not be mi&s;chievous or uncertain in its effects.</P>
<P>THE chief advantage which the&s;e fictions have over real life is, that their authors are at liberty, tho' not to invent, yet to &s;elect objects, and to cull from the ma&s;s of mankind, tho&s;e individuals upon which the attention ought mo&s;t to be employ'd; as a diamond, though it cannot be made, may be poli&s;hed by art, and placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to di&s;play that lu&s;tre which before was buried among common &s;tones.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
IT is ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the greate&s;t excel|lency of art, to imitate nature; but it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e parts of nature, which are mo&s;t proper for imitation: greater care is &s;till required in repre&s;enting life, which is &s;o often di&s;coloured by pa&s;&s;ion, or deformed by wickedne&s;s. If the world be promi&s;cuou&s;ly de&s;cribed, I cannot &s;ee of what u&s;e it can be to read the account; or why it may not be as &s;afe to turn the eye immediately upon mankind, as upon a mirror which &s;hows all that pre&s;ents it&s;elf without di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>IT is therefore not a &s;ufficient vindication of a character, that it is drawn as it appears, for many characters ought never to be drawn; nor of a narrative, that the train of events is agreeable to ob&s;ervation and experience, for that ob&s;ervation which is called knowledge of the world, will be found much more frequent|ly to make men cunning than good. The purpo&s;e of the&s;e writings is &s;urely not only to &s;how mankind, but to provide that they may be &s;een hereafter with le&s;s hazard; to teach the means of avoiding the &s;nares which are laid by TREACHERY for INNOCENCE, without in|fu&s;ing any wi&s;h for that &s;uperiority with which
<PB N="33" REF="34">
the betrayer flatters his vanity; to give the power of counteracting fraud, without the temptation to practi&s;e it; to initiate youth by mock encounters in the art of nece&s;&s;ary de|fence, and to increa&s;e prudence without impair|ing virtue.</P>
<P>MANY writers for the &s;ake of following na|ture, &s;o mingle good and bad qualities in their principal per&s;onages, that they are both equal|ly con&s;picuous; and as we accompany them through their adventures with delight, and are led by degrees to intere&s;t our&s;elves in their favour, we lo&s;e the abhorrence of their faults, becau&s;e they do not hinder our plea&s;ure, or, perhaps, regard them with &s;ome kindne&s;s for being united with &s;o much merit.</P>
<P>THERE have been men indeed &s;plendidly wicked, who&s;e endowments throw a bright|ne&s;s on their crimes, and whom &s;carce any villainy made perfectly dete&s;table, becau&s;e they never could be wholly dive&s;ted of their excellencies; but &s;uch have been in all ages the great corrupters of the world, and their re&s;emblance ought no more to be pre&s;erved, than the art of murdering without pain.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
SOME have advanced, without due attention to the con&s;equences of this notion, that certain virtues have their corre&s;pondent faults, and therefore that to exhibit either apart is to de|viate from probability. Thus men are ob&s;er|ved by Swift to be grateful in the &s;ame degree as they are re&s;entful. This principle, with others of the &s;ame kind, &s;uppo&s;es man to act from a brute impul&s;e, and per&s;ue a certain de|gree of inclination, without any choice of the object; for, otherwi&s;e, though it &s;hould be allowed that gratitude and re&s;entment ari&s;e from the &s;ame con&s;titution of the pa&s;&s;ions, it follows not that they will be equally indulged when rea&s;on is con&s;ulted; yet unle&s;s that con|&s;equence be admitted, this &s;agacious maxim be|comes an empty &s;ound, without any relation to practice or to life.</P>
<P>NOR is it evident, that even the fir&s;t motions to the&s;e effects are always in the &s;ame propor|tion. For pride, which produces quickne&s;s of re&s;entment, will frequently ob&s;truct grati|tude, by unwillingne&s;s to admit that inferiority which obligation nece&s;&s;arily implies; and it is &s;urely very unlikely, that he who cannot think he receives a favour will ever acknow|ledge it.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
IT is of the utmo&s;t importance to mankind, that po&s;itions of this tendency &s;hould be laid open and confuted; for while men con&s;ider good and evil as &s;pringing from the &s;ame root, they will &s;pare the one for the &s;ake of the other, and in judging, if not of others at lea&s;t of them&s;elves, will be apt to e&s;timate their virtues by their vices. To this fatal error all tho&s;e will contribute, who confound the colours of right and wrong, and in&s;tead of helping to &s;ettle their boundaries, mix them with &s;o much art, that no common mind is able to di&s;unite them.</P>
<P>IN narratives, where hi&s;torical veracity has no place, I cannot di&s;cover why there &s;hould not be exhibited the mo&s;t perfect idea of virtue; of virtue not angelical, nor above probability, for what we cannot credit we &s;hall never imi|tate, but of the highe&s;t and pure&s;t kind that humanity can reach, which, when exerci&s;ed in &s;uch trials as the various revolutions of things &s;hall bring upon it, may, by conquering &s;ome calamites, and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform. Vice, for vice is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;hewn, &s;hould always di&s;gu&s;t; nor &s;hould the graces of gaiety, or the dignity of courage, be &s;o united
<PB N="36" REF="37">
with it, as to reconcile it to the mind. Where|ever it appears, it &s;hould rai&s;e hatred by the malignity of its practices, and contempt by the meanne&s;s of its &s;tratagems; for while it is &s;upported by either parts or &s;pirit, it will be &s;eldom heartily abhorred. The Roman tyrant was content to be hated, if he was but feared; and there are thou&s;ands of the readers of ro|mances willing to be thought wicked, if they may be allowed to be wits. It is therefore to be &s;teadily inculcated, that virtue is the high|e&s;t proof of a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, and the only &s;olid ba&s;is of greatne&s;s; and that vice is the natural con&s;equence of narrow thoughts, that it begins in mi&s;take, and ends in ignominy.</P>

<P>EVERY man is &s;ufficiently di&s;contented with &s;ome circum&s;tances of his pre&s;ent &s;tate, to &s;uffer his imagination to range more or le&s;s in que&s;t of future happine&s;s, and to fix upon &s;ome point of time, in which he &s;hall, by
<PB N="37" REF="38">
the removal of the inconvenience which now perplexes him, or the acqui&s;ition of advantage which he at pre&s;ent wants, find the condition of his life very much improved.</P>
<P>WHEN this time, which is too often ex|pected with great impatience, at la&s;t arrives, it generally comes without the ble&s;&s;ing for which it was de&s;ired; but we &s;olace our&s;elves with &s;ome new pro&s;pect, and pre&s;s forward a|gain with equal eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ome advantage to a man, in whom this temper prevails in any great degree, when he turns his hopes upon things wholly out of his own power; &s;ince he forbears then to preci|pitate his affairs, for the &s;ake of the great event that is to complete his felicity, and waits for the bli&s;sful hour, without neglecting &s;uch mea&s;ures as are nece&s;&s;ary to be taken in the mean time.</P>
<P>I HAVE long known a per&s;on of this tem|per, who indulged his dream of happine&s;s with le&s;s hurt to him&s;elf than &s;uch chimerical wi&s;hes commonly produce, and adju&s;ted his &s;cheme with &s;uch addre&s;s, that his hopes were in full bloom three parts of the year, and in
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the other part never wholly bla&s;ted. Many, perhaps, would be de&s;irous of learning by what means he procured to him&s;elf &s;uch a cheap and la&s;ting &s;atisfaction. It was gained only by a con&s;tant practice of referring the re|moval of all his unea&s;ine&s;s to the coming of the next &s;pring. If his affairs were di&s;order|ed, he could regulate them in the &s;pring; if a regimen was pre&s;cribed him, the &s;pring was the proper time of per&s;uing it; if what he wanted was at a high price, it would fall its value in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>THE &s;pring, indeed, did often come with|out any of the&s;e effects, but he was always certain that the next would be more propitious; and was never convinced that the pre&s;ent &s;pring would fail him until the middle of &s;ummer; for he always talked of the &s;pring as coming 'till it was pa&s;t, and when it was once pa&s;t, every one agreed with him that it was coming.</P>
<P>BY long conver&s;e with this man, I am, per|haps, in &s;ome degree brought to feel the &s;ame immoderate plea&s;ure in the contemplation of this delightful &s;ea&s;on; but I have the &s;ati&s;|faction of finding many, whom it can be no &s;hame to re&s;emble, infected with the &s;ame en|thu&s;ia&s;m;
<PB N="39" REF="40">
for there is, I believe, &s;carce any poet of eminence, who has not left &s;ome te&s;timony of his fondne&s;s for the flowers, the zephyrs, and the warblers of the &s;pring. Nor has the mo&s;t luxuriant imagination been able to de&s;cribe the &s;erenity and happine&s;s of the golden age, otherwi&s;e than by giving a per|petual &s;pring, as the highe&s;t reward of un|corrupted innocence.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing, in the annual renovation of the world, and the new di&s;play of the trea&s;ures of nature. The cold and darkne&s;s of winter, with the naked deformity of every object on which we turn our eyes, makes us nece&s;&s;arily rejoice at the &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;on, as well for what we have e&s;caped, as for what we may enjoy; and every budding flower, which a warm &s;ituation brings early to our view, is con&s;idered by us as a me&s;&s;enger to inform us of the approach of more joyous days.</P>
<P>THE SPRING affords to a mind, &s;o free from the di&s;turbance of cares or pa&s;&s;ions as to be vacant to calm amu&s;ements, almo&s;t every thing that our pre&s;ent &s;tate makes us capable of enjoying. The variegated verdure of the
<PB N="40" REF="41">
fields and woods, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of grateful odours, the voice of plea&s;ure pouring out its notes on every &s;ide, with the ob&s;ervation of the gladne&s;s apparently conceived by every animal, from the growth of his food, and the clemency of the weather, throw over the whole earth an air of gaiety, which is very &s;ignificantly expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;mile of nature.</P>
<P>THERE are men to whom the&s;e &s;cenes are able to give no delight, and who hurry away from all the varieties of rural beauty, to lo&s;e their hours, and divert their thoughts by cards, or a&s;&s;emblies, a tavern dinner, or the prattle of the day.</P>
<P>IT may be laid down as a po&s;ition which will &s;eldom deceive, that when a man cannot bear his own company there is &s;omething wrong. He mu&s;t fly from him&s;elf, either be|cau&s;e he feels a tediou&s;ne&s;s in life from the equipoi&s;e of an empty mind, which, having no tendency to one motion more than another but as it is impelled by &s;ome external power, mu&s;t always have recour&s;e to foreign objects; or he mu&s;t be afraid of the intru&s;ion of &s;ome unplea&s;ing ideas, and, perhaps, is always &s;truggling to e&s;cape from the remembrance of

a lo&s;s, the fear of a calamity, or &s;ome other thought of greater horror.</P>

<P>THAT man &s;hould never &s;uffer his hap|pine&s;s to depend upon external circum|&s;tances, is one of the chief precepts of the Stoical philo&s;ophy; a precept, indeed, which that lofty &s;ect has extended beyond the condi|tion of human life, and in which &s;ome of them &s;eem to have compri&s;ed an utter exclu|&s;ion of all corporeal pain and plea&s;ure, from the regard or attention of a wi&s;e man.</P>

<P>THE numberle&s;s expedients practi&s;ed by this cla&s;s of mortals to alleviate the burthen of life, is not le&s;s &s;hameful, nor, perhaps, much le&s;s pitiable, than tho&s;e to which a trader on the edge of bankruptcy is reduced.

<P>THE general remedy of tho&s;e, who are unea&s;y

<P>THESE reflexions aro&s;e in my mind upon the remembrance of a pa&s;&s;age in Cowley's preface to his poems, where, however exalted by his genius, and enlarged by his acqui&s;itions, he informs us of a &s;cheme of happine&s;s to which the imagination of a girl, upon the lo&s;s of her fir&s;t lover, would have &s;carcely given way; but which he &s;eems to have indulged till he had totally forgotten its ab&s;urdity, and would have, probably, put in execution, had he been hindered only by his rea&s;on.</P>
<Q>'MY de&s;ire,' &s;ay she, 'has been for &s;ome years pa&s;t, though the execution has been acciden|tally diverted, and does &s;till vehemently con|tinue, to retire my&s;elf to &s;ome of our Ame|rican plantations, not to &s;eek for gold, or enrich my&s;elf with the traffic of tho&s;e parts, which is the end of mo&s;t men that travel thither; but to for&s;ake this world for ever, with all the vanities and vexations of it, and to bury my &s;elf there in &s;ome ob&s;cure retreat, but not without the con&s;olation of letters and philo&s;ophy.'</Q>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
SUCH was the chimerical provi&s;ion which Cowley had made, in his own mind, for the quiet of his remaining life, and which he &s;eems to recomend to po&s;terity, &s;ince there is no other rea&s;on for his di&s;clo&s;ing it. Surely no &s;tronger in&s;tance can be given of a per&s;ua&s;ion that content was the inhabitant of particular regions, and that a man might &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind, and leave behind him all his cares, incumbrances, and calamities.</P>
<P>IF he travelled &s;o far with no other purpo&s;e than to <HI>bury him&s;elf in &s;ome ob&s;cure retreat,</HI> he might have found, in his own country, innu|merable coverts &s;ufficiently ob&s;cure to have concealed the genius of Cowley; for, what|ever might be his own opinion of the impor|tunity with which he &s;hould be &s;ummoned back into public life, a &s;hort experience would have convinced him, that privation is much ea&s;ier than acqui&s;ition, and that it would re|quire very little policy to free him&s;elf from the intru&s;ion of the world. There is pride enough in the human heart to prevent much de&s;ire of acquaintance with a man by whom we are &s;ure to be treated with neglect, however his reputation for &s;cience or virtue may excite

our curio&s;ity or e&s;teem; &s;o that the lover of retirement need not be much afraid le&s;t the re&s;pect of &s;trangers &s;hould overwhelm him with vi&s;its; and tho&s;e to whom he has for|merly been known will very patiently &s;upport his ab&s;ence, when they have tryed a little to live without him, and found new diver&s;ions for tho&s;e moments which his company contribu|ted to exhilarate or relax.</P>
<P>IT was, perhaps, ordained by providence, to hinder us from tyranni&s;ing over one another, that no individual &s;hould be of &s;o much impor|tance, as to cau&s;e by his retreat or death any cha&s;m in the world. And Cowley had con|ver&s;ed to little purpo&s;e with mankind, if he had not remarked, how &s;oon the u&s;eful friend, the gay companion, and the favoured lover, when once they are removed from before the fight, give way to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects.</P>
<P>THE privacy, therefore, of his hermitage might have been &s;afe enough from violation, though he had cho&s;en it within the limits of his native i&s;land; and he might have found here pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the <HI>vanities</HI> and <HI>vexations</HI> of the world, not le&s;s efficacious than

tho&s;e, which the woods or fields of America could afford him: but having once his mind imbittered with di&s;gu&s;t, he conceived it impo&s;|&s;ible to be far enough from the cau&s;e of his unea&s;ine&s;s; he was po&s;ting away with all the expedition of a coward, who, for want of ven|turing to look behind him, thinks the enemy perpetually at his heels.</P>
<P>WHEN he was interrupted by company, or fatigued with bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;o &s;trongly imaged to him&s;elf the happine&s;s of lei&s;ure and retreat, that he determined to enjoy them for the future without interuption, and to exclude for ever all that could deprive him of his darling &s;ati&s;|factions. He forgot, in the vehemence of his de&s;ire, that &s;olitude and quiet owe their plea|&s;ures to tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which he was &s;o &s;tudi|ous to obviate; for &s;uch are the vici&s;&s;itudes of the world, through all its parts, that day and night, labour and re&s;t, conver&s;e and retirement, endear each other; &s;uch are the changes that keep the mind in action; we de&s;ire, we per|&s;ue, we obtain, we are &s;atiated; we de&s;ire &s;omething el&s;e, and begin a new per&s;uit.</P>
<P>IF he had proceeded in his project, and &s;ixt his habitation in the mo&s;t delightful part
<PB N="52" REF="53">
of the new world, it may be much doubted, whether his di&s;tance from the <HI>vanities</HI> of life would have enabled him to have kept away the <HI>vexations.</HI> It is common for a man, who feels pain, to fancy that he could bear it better in any other part. Cowley having known the troubles and perplexities of a particular condi|tion, very readily per&s;uaded him&s;elf that no|thing wor&s;e was to be found, and that every alteration would bring &s;ome improvement; he never &s;u&s;pected that the cau&s;e of his unhap|pine&s;s was in him&s;elf, that his own pa&s;&s;ions were not &s;ufficiently regulated, and that he was harra&s;&s;ed by his own impatience, which, as it could never be without &s;omething to awa|ken it, would torment him in any other coun|try, accompany him over the &s;ea, and find its way to his American ely&s;ium. He would, upon the tryal, have been &s;oon convinced, that the fountain of content mu&s;t &s;pring up in the mind; and that he, who has &s;o little knowledge of human nature, as to &s;eek hap|pine&s;s by changing any thing, but his own di&s;po&s;itions, will wa&s;te his life in fruitle&s;s efforts, and multiply the griefs which he pur|po&s;es to remove.</P>

TO produce this di&s;po&s;ition nothing appears requi&s;ite but a quick &s;en&s;ibility, and active imagination; for, without being devoted to the per&s;uit of virtue, or the &s;tudy of &s;cience, a man, who&s;e faculties enable him to make rea|dy compari&s;ons of the pre&s;ent with the pa&s;t, will find &s;uch a con&s;tant recurrence of the &s;ame plea&s;ures, the &s;ame troubles, the &s;ame expecta|tions, and the &s;ame di&s;appointments, that he will gladly &s;natch an hour of retreat, to let his thoughts expatiate at large, and &s;eek for that variety in his own ideas, which the objects of &s;en&s;e cannot afford him.</P>

<P>THESE are &s;ome of the motives which have had power to &s;eque&s;ter kings and heroes from the crouds that &s;oothed them with flat|teries, or in&s;pirited them with acclamations; but their efficacy &s;eems confined to &s;uperior abilities, and to operate little upon the com|mon cla&s;&s;es of mankind, to who&s;e conceptions the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;emblage of things is adequate, and who &s;eldom range beyond tho&s;e enter|tainments and vexations, which &s;olicit their attention by pre&s;&s;ing on their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT there is an univer&s;al rea&s;on for &s;ome &s;tated intervals of &s;olitude, which the in&s;titu|tions of the church call upon me, now e&s;pe|cially, to mention; a rea&s;on, which extends as wide as moral duty, or the hopes of divine favour in a future &s;tate; and which ought to

<P>THE great ta&s;k of the man, who conducts his life by the precepts of religion, is to make the future predominant over the pre&s;ent, to impre&s;s upon his mind &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of the importance of obedience to the divine will, of the value of the reward promi&s;ed to virtue, and the terrors of the puni&s;hment denounced again&s;t crimes, as may overbear all the temp|tations which temporal hope or fear can bring in his way, and enable him to bid equal de|fiance to joy and &s;orrow, to turn away at one time from the allurements of ambition, and pu&s;h forward at another again&s;t the threats of calamity.</P>
<P>IT is not without rea&s;on that the apo&s;tle repre&s;ents our pa&s;&s;age through this &s;tage of our exi&s;tence by images drawn from the alarms and &s;olicitude of a military life; for we are
<PB N="67" REF="58">
placed in &s;uch a &s;tate, that almo&s;t every thing about us con&s;pires again&s;t our chief intere&s;t. We are in danger from whatever can get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our thoughts; all that can excite in us either pain or plea&s;ure has a tendency to ob&s;truct the way that leads to happine&s;s, and either to turn us a&s;ide, or retard our pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR &s;en&s;es, our appetites, and our pa&s;&s;ions, are our lawful and faithful guides, in mo&s;t things that relate &s;olely to this life; and, there|fore, by the hourly nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting them, we gradually &s;ink into an implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and habitual confidence. Every act of compliance with their motions facilitates a &s;econd compliance, every new &s;tep towards depravity is made with le&s;s reluctance than the former, and thus the de&s;cent to life merely &s;en&s;ual is perpetually accelerated.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;es have not only that advantage over con&s;cience, which things nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t always have over things cho&s;en, but they have likewi&s;e a kind of pre&s;cription in their favour. We feared pain much earlier than we appre|hended guilt, and were delighted with the &s;en|&s;ations of plea&s;ure, before we had capacities
<PB N="58" REF="59">
to be charmed with the beauty of rectitude. To this power, thus early e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in|ce&s;&s;antly increa&s;ing, it mu&s;t be remembered, that almo&s;t every man has, in &s;ome part of his life, added new &s;trength by a voluntary or negligent &s;ubjection of him&s;elf; for who is there that has not in&s;tigated his appetites by indulgence, or &s;uffered them by an unre&s;i&s;ting neutrality to enlarge their dominion, and mul|tiply their demands?</P>
<P>FROM the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;en|&s;ual faculties of the influence which they mu&s;t naturally gain by this preoccupation of the &s;oul, ari&s;es that conflict between oppo&s;ite de|&s;ires, in the fir&s;t endeavours after a religious life; which, however enthu&s;ia&s;tically it may have been de&s;cribed, however contemptuou&s;ly ridiculed, will naturally be felt in &s;ome degree, though varied without end, by different tem|pers of mind, and innumerable circum&s;tances of health or condition, greater or le&s;s fervour, more or fewer temptations to relap&s;e.</P>
<P>FROM the perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting the animal faculties, in our provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ent life, ari&s;es the difficulty of with&s;tand|ing their impul&s;es, even in ca&s;es where they

ought to be of no weight; for the motions of &s;en&s;e are in&s;tantaneous, its objects &s;trike un|&s;ought, we are accu&s;tomed to follow its di|rections, and therefore often &s;ubmit to the &s;entence without examining the authority of the judge.</P>
<P>THUS it appears upon a philo&s;ophical e&s;ti|mate, that, &s;uppo&s;ing the mind, at any cer|tain time, in an equipoi&s;e between the plea&s;ures of this life, and the hopes of futuri|ty, pre&s;ent objects falling more frequently into the &s;cale would in time preponderate, and that our regard for an invi&s;ible &s;tate would grow every moment weaker, till at la&s;t it would lo&s;e all its activity, and become ab&s;o|lutely without effect.</P>
<P>TO prevent this dreadful event, the balance is put into our own hands, and we have power to transfer the weight to either &s;ide. The motives to a life of holine&s;s are infinite, not le&s;s than the favour or anger of omnipotence, not le&s;s than eternity of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. But the&s;e can only influence our conduct as they gain our attention, which the bu&s;ine&s;s, or diver&s;ions, of the world are always calling off by contrary attractions.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
THE great art therefore of piety, and the end for which all the rites of religion &s;eem to be in&s;tituted, is the perpetual renovation of the motives to virtue, by a voluntary employ|ment of our mind in the contemplation of its excellence, its importance, and its nece&s;&s;ity, which, in proportion as they are more fre|quently and more willingly revolved, gain a more forcible and permanent influence, 'till in time they become the reigning ideas, the &s;tand|ing principles of action, and the te&s;t by which everything propo&s;ed to the judgment is rejected or approved.</P>
<P>TO facilitate this change of our affections, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we weaken the temptations of the world, by retiring at certain &s;ea&s;ons from it; for its influence ari&s;ing only from its pre&s;ence, is much le&s;&s;ened when it becomes the object of &s;olitary meditation. A con&s;tant re&s;idence amid&s;t noi&s;e and plea&s;ure inevitably obliterates the impre&s;&s;ions of piety, and a fre|quent ab&s;traction of our&s;elves into a &s;tate, where this life, like the next, operates only upon the rea&s;on, will rein&s;tate religion in its ju&s;t authority, even without tho&s;e irradiations from above, the hope of which I have yet no
<PB N="61" REF="62">
no intention to withdraw from the &s;incere and the diligent.</P>
<P>THIS is that conque&s;t of the world and of our&s;elves, which has been always con&s;idered as the perfection of human nature; and this is only to be obtained by fervent prayer, &s;teady re&s;olutions, and frequent retirement from folly and vanity, from the cares of avarice, and the joys of intemperance, from the lulling &s;ounds of deceitful flattery, and the tempting &s;ight of pro&s;perous wickedne&s;s.</P>

real action would bear to his &s;eeming po&s;&s;ibi|lities of action, how many cha&s;ms he would find of perfect vacuity, and how many inter|&s;titial &s;paces unfilled, even in the mo&s;t tumul|tuous hurries of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the mo&s;t eager vehemence of per&s;uit.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved by modern philo&s;ophers, that not only the great globes of matter are thinly &s;cattered through the univer&s;e, but the harde&s;t bodies are &s;o porous, that, if all matter were compre&s;&s;ed to perfect &s;olidity, it might be contained in a cube of a few feet. In like manner, if all the employments of life were crowded into the time which it really occupi|ed, perhaps a few weeks, days, or hours, would be &s;ufficient for its accompli&s;hment, &s;o far as the mind was engaged in the perfor|mance. For &s;uch is the inequality of our corporeal to our intellectual faculties, that we contrive in minutes what we execute in years, and the &s;oul often &s;tands an idle &s;pectator of the labour of the hands, and expedition of the feet.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on, the antient generals often found them&s;elves at lei&s;ure to per&s;ue the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy in the camp; and Lucan, with
<PB N="63" REF="64">
hi&s;torical veracity, makes Cae&s;ar relate of him|&s;elf, that his wars never hindered cele&s;tial ob|&s;ervations, and that he noted the revolutions of the &s;tars in the mid&s;t of preparations for battle. <Q><L>&mdash;Media inter praelia &s;emper</L>

<P>THAT the &s;oul always exerts her peculiar powers, with greater or le&s;s force, is very probable, though the common occa&s;ions of our pre&s;ent condition require but a &s;mall part of that ince&s;&s;ant cogitation; and by the na|tural frame of our bodies, and general combi|nation of the world, we are, unavoidably, con|demned to &s;o frequent inactivity, that, as through all our time we are thinking, for a great part of our time we can only think.</P>
<P>LEST &s;o re&s;tle&s;s a power &s;hould be either unprofitably, or hurtfully employed, and the &s;uperfluities of intellect run to wa&s;te, it is no vain &s;peculation to con&s;ider how we may go|vern our thoughts, re&s;train them from irregu|lar motions, or confine them from boundle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>HOW the under&s;tanding is be&s;t conducted to
<PB N="64" REF="65">
the knowledge of &s;cience, by what &s;teps it is to be led forwards in its per&s;uit, how it is to be cured of its defects, and habituated to new &s;tudies, has been the inquiry of many acute and learned men, who&s;e ob&s;ervations I &s;hall not, on this occa&s;ion, either adopt or cen&s;ure; my purpo&s;e being to con&s;ider the moral di&s;|cipline of the mind, and to promote the in|crea&s;e of virtue rather than of learning.</P>
<P>THIS inquiry &s;eems to have been neglected for want of remembering that all action has its origin in the mind, and that therefore to &s;uffer the thoughts to be vitiated, is to poi&s;on the fountains of morality: Irregular de&s;ires will produce licentious practices; what men allow them&s;elves to wi&s;h they will &s;oon believe, and will be at la&s;t incited to execute what they plea&s;e them&s;elves with contriving.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on the ca&s;ui&s;ts of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church, who gain, by confe&s;&s;ion, great oppor|tunities of knowing human nature, have, I think, generally determined that what it is a crime to do, it is a crime to think. Since by revolving with plea&s;ure, the facility, &s;afety or advantage of a wicked deed, a man &s;oon be|gins to find his con&s;tancy relax, and his de|te&s;tation
<PB N="65" REF="66">
&s;often; the happine&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s is glittering before him, withdraws his attention from the atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the guilt, and acts-are at la&s;t confidently perpetrated, of which the fir&s;t conception only crept into the mind, di&s;|gui&s;ed in plea&s;ing complications, and permit|ted rather than invited.</P>
<P>NO man has ever been drawn to crimes, by love or jealou&s;y, envy or hatred, but he can tell how ea&s;ily he might at fir&s;t have repelled the temptation, how readily his mind would have obeyed a call to any other object, and how weak his pa&s;&s;ion has been after &s;ome ca&s;ual a|vocation, 'till he has recalled it again to his heart, and revived the viper by too warm a fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>SUCH, therefore, is the importance of keep|ing our rea&s;on a con&s;tant guard over our ima|gination, that we have otherwi&s;e no &s;ecurity for our own virtue, but may corrupt our hearts in the mo&s;t reclu&s;e &s;olitude, with more perni|cious and tyrannical appetites and wi&s;hes, than the commerce of the world will generally produce; for we are ea&s;ily &s;hocked by crimes which appear at once in their full magnitude, but the gradual growth of our own wickedne&s;s,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
endeared by intere&s;t, and palliated by all the artifices of &s;elf-deceit, gives us time to form di&s;tinctions in our own favour, and rea&s;on by degrees &s;ubmits to ab&s;urdity, as the eye is ac|commodated to darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;oul, it is of the ut|mo&s;t importance to apply remedies at the be|ginning; and, therefore, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew what thoughts are to be rejected or im|proved, as they regard the pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or fu|ture; in hopes that &s;ome may be awakened to caution and vigilance, who, perhaps, indulge them&s;elves in dangerous dreams, &s;o much the more dangerous, becau&s;e being yet only dreams they are concluded innocent.</P>
<P>THE recollection of the pa&s;t is only u&s;eful by way of provi&s;ion for the future, and therer|fore, in reviewing all the occurrences that fall under a religious con&s;ideration, it is proper that a man &s;top at the fir&s;t thoughts, to remark how he was led thither, and why he continues the reflection. If he is dwelling with de|light upon a &s;tratagem of &s;ucce&s;sful fraud, a night of licentious riot, or an intrigue of guilty plea&s;ure, let him &s;ummon off his imagi|nation as from an unlawful per&s;uit, expel tho&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="68">
pa&s;&s;ages from his remembrance, of which, though he cannot &s;eriou&s;ly approve them, the plea&s;ure overpowers the guilt, and refer them to a future hour, when they may be con&s;idered with greater &s;afety. Such an hour will cer|tainly come; for the impre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;t plea|&s;ure are always le&s;&s;ening, but the &s;en&s;e of guilt, which re&s;pects futurity, continues the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE &s;erious and impartial retro&s;pect of our conduct is indi&s;putably nece&s;&s;ary to the confir|mation or recovery of virtue, and is, therefore, recommended under the name of &s;elf-examina|tion, by divines, as the fir&s;t act previous to repentance. It is, indeed, of &s;o great u&s;e, that without it we &s;hould always be to begin life, be &s;educed for ever by the &s;ame allurements, and mi&s;led by the &s;ame fallacies. But in order that we may not lo&s;e the advantage of our ex|perience, we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;ee every thing in its proper form, and excite in our&s;elves tho&s;e &s;entiments which the great author of nature has decreed the concomitants or followers of good or bad actions.</P>

<P>IN futurity chiefly are the &s;nares lodged, by which the imagination is intangled. Futurity is the proper abode of hope and fear, with all their train and progeny of &s;ubordinate appre|hen&s;ions and de&s;ires. In futurity events and
<PB N="69" REF="70">
chances are yet floating at large, without appa|rent connexion with their cau&s;es, and we therefore ea&s;ily indulge the liberty of gratifying our&s;elves with a plea&s;ing choice. To pick and cull among po&s;&s;ible advantages is, as the civil law terms it, <HI>in vacuum venire,</HI> to take what belongs to nobody; but it has this ha|zard in it, that we &s;hall be unwilling to quit what we have &s;eized, though an owner &s;hould be found. It is ea&s;y to think on that which may be gained, till at la&s;t we re&s;olve to gain it, and to imagine the happine&s;s of particular con|ditions till we can be ea&s;y in no other. We ought, at lea&s;t, to let our de&s;ires fix upon nothing in another's power for the &s;ake of our quiet, or in another's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the &s;ake of our inno|cence. When a man finds him&s;elf led, though by a train of hone&s;t &s;entiments, to a wi&s;h for that to which he has no right, he &s;hould &s;tart back as from a pitfal covered with flowers. He that fancies he &s;hould benefit the publick more in a great &s;tation than the man that fills it, will in time imagine it an act of virtue to &s;upplant him; and, as oppo&s;ition readily kin|dles into hatred, his eagerne&s;s to do that good, to which he is not called, will betray him to crimes, which in his original &s;cheme were never purpo&s;ed.</P>

<P>IT is ju&s;tly remarked by Horace, that, how|&s;oever every man may complain occa&s;io|nally of the hard&s;hips of his condition, he is &s;eldom willing to change it for any other on the &s;ame level: for whether it be that he, who follows an employment, made choice of it at fir&s;t on account of its &s;uitablene&s;s to his inclination; or that when accident, or the de|termination of others, have placed him in a particular &s;tation, he, by endeavouring to re|concile him&s;elf to it, gets the cu&s;tom of view|ing
<PB N="71" REF="72">
it only on the faire&s;t &s;ide; or whether eve|ry man thinks that cla&s;s to which he belongs the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, merely becau&s;e he has honoured it with his name; it is certain, that, whatever be the rea&s;on, mo&s;t men have a very &s;trong and active prejudice in favour of their own vocation, always working upon their minds, and influencing their behaviour.</P>
<P>THIS partiality is &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible in eve|ry rank of the human &s;pecies; but it exerts it&s;elf more frequently and with greater force among tho&s;e who have never learned to con|ceal their &s;entiments for rea&s;ons of policy, or to model their expre&s;&s;ions by the laws of po|litene&s;s; and therefore the chief conte&s;ts of wit among artificers and handicraft&s;men ari&s;e from a mutual endeavour to exalt one trade by de|preciating another.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principle are derived many con&s;olations to alleviate the inconveniences to which every calling is peculiarly expo&s;ed. A black&s;mith was lately plea&s;ing him&s;elf at his anvil, with ob&s;erving that, though his trade was hot and &s;ooty, laborious and unhealthy, yet he had the honour of living by his ham|mer, he got his bread like a man, and if his &s;on
<PB N="72" REF="73">
&s;hould ri&s;e in the world, and keep his coach, no body could reproach him that his father was a taylor.</P>
<P>A MAN, truly zealous for his fraternity, is never &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly flattered, as when &s;ome rival calling is mentioned with contempt. Upon this principle a linen-draper boa&s;ted that he had got a new cu&s;tomer, whom he could &s;afely tru&s;t, for he could have no doubt of his hone&s;ty, &s;ince it was known, from unque&s;ti|onable authority, that he was now filing a bill in chancery to delay payment for the cloaths which he had worn the la&s;t &s;even years; and he him&s;elf had heard him declare, in a publick coffee-hou&s;e, that he looked upon the whole generation of woollen-drapers to be &s;uch de&s;pi|cable wretches, that no gentleman ought to pay them till the demand was doubled by law charges.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved that phy&s;icians and lawyers are no friends to religion; and many conjectures have been formed to di&s;cover the rea&s;on of &s;uch a combination between men who agree in nothing el&s;e, and who &s;eem le&s;s to be affected, in their own provinces, by re|ligious opinions, than any other part of the
<PB N="73" REF="74">
community. The truth is, very few of them have thought about religion; but they have all &s;een a par&s;on, &s;een him in a habit different from their own, and therefore declared war again&s;t him. A young &s;tudent from the inns of court, who has often attacked the curate of his father's pari&s;h with &s;uch arguments as his acquaintances could furni&s;h, and returned to town without &s;ucce&s;s, is now gone down with a re&s;olution to de&s;troy him; for he has learned at la&s;t how to manage a prig, and if he pretends to hold him again to &s;yllogi&s;m, he has a catch in re&s;erve, which neither logic nor metaphy&s;ics can re&s;i&s;t. <Q><L>I laugh to think how your un&s;haken <HI>Cato</HI></L>
<L>Will look agha&s;t, when unfore&s;een de&s;truction</L>
<L>Pours in upon him thus.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE malignity of &s;oldiers and &s;ailors again&s;t each other has been often experienced at the co&s;t of their country; and, perhaps, no orders of men have an enmity of more acrimony, or longer continuance. When, upon our late &s;ucce&s;&s;es at &s;ea, &s;ome new regulations were concerted for e&s;tabli&s;hing the rank of the naval com|manders, a captain of foot very acutely re|marked, that nothing was more ab&s;urd than to give any honorary rewards to &s;eamen, "for
<PB N="74" REF="75">
honour, &s;ays he, ought only to be won by bravery, and all the world knows that there is no danger, and therefore no evidence of courage in a fight at &s;ea."</P>
<P>BUT as this general de&s;ire of aggrandizing them&s;elves by rai&s;ing their profe&s;&s;ion, betrays men to a thou&s;and ridiculous and mi&s;chievous acts of &s;upplantation and detraction, &s;o, as almo&s;t all pa&s;&s;ions have their good as well as bad effects, it likewi&s;e excites ingenuity, and &s;ometimes rai&s;es an hone&s;t and u&s;eful emulation of diligence. It may be ob&s;erved in general that no trade had ever reached the excellence to which it is now improved, had its profe&s;&s;ors looked upon it with the eyes of indifferent &s;pectators; the advances, from the fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ays, mu&s;t have been made by men who valued them&s;elves for performances, for which &s;carce any other would be per&s;uaded to e&s;teem them.</P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ing to contemplate a manufacture ri&s;ing gradually from its fir&s;t mean &s;tate by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive labours of innumerable minds; to con&s;ider the fir&s;t hollow trunk of an oak, in which, perhaps, the &s;hepherd could &s;carce venture to cro&s;s a brook &s;welled with a
<PB N="75" REF="76">
&s;hower, enlarged at la&s;t into a &s;hip of war, attacking fortre&s;&s;es, terrifying nations, &s;etting &s;torms and billows at defiance, and vi&s;iting the remote&s;t parts of the globe. And it might contribute to di&s;po&s;e us to a kinder regard for the labours of one another, if we were to con&s;ider from what unpromi&s;ing beginnings the mo&s;t u&s;eful productions of art have pro|bably ari&s;en. Who, when he &s;aw the fir&s;t &s;and or a&s;hes, by a ca&s;ual inten&s;ene&s;s of heat melted into a metalline form, rugged with ex|cre&s;cences, and clouded with impurities, would have imagined, that in this &s;hapele&s;s lump lay concealed &s;o many conveniencies of life, as would in time con&s;titute a great part of the happine&s;s of the world? Yet by &s;ome &s;uch fortuitous liquefaction was mankind taught to procure a body at once in a high degree &s;olid and tran&s;parent, which might admit the light of the &s;un, and exclude the violence of the wind; which might extend the &s;ight of the philo&s;opher to new ranges of exi&s;tence, and charm him at one time with the unbounded extent of the material creation, and at another with the endle&s;s &s;ubordination of animal life; and, what is yet of more importance, might &s;upply the decays of nature, and &s;uccour old age with &s;ub&s;idiary &s;ight. Thus was the fir&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="77">
artificer in gla&s;s employed, though without his own knowledge or expectation. He was facilitating and prolonging the enjoyment of light, enlarging the avenues of &s;cience, and conferring the highe&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting plea|&s;ures; he was enabling the &s;tudent to con|template nature, and the beauty to behold her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ion for the honour of a profe&s;&s;ion, like that for the grandeur of our own country, is to be regulated not extingui&s;hed. Every man, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t &s;tation, ought to warm his heart and animate his en|deavours with the hopes of being u&s;eful to the world, by advancing the art which it is his lot to exerci&s;e; and for that end he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;ider the whole extent of its application, and the whole weight of its importance. But let him not too readily imagine that another is ill employed, becau&s;e, for want of fuller knowledge of his bu&s;ine&s;s, he is not able to comprehend its dignity. Every man ought to endeavour at eminence, not by pulling others down, but by rai&s;ing him&s;elf, and en|joy the plea&s;ure of his own &s;uperiority, whether imaginary or real, without interrupting others in the &s;ame felicity. The philo&s;opher may
<PB N="77" REF="78">
very ju&s;tly be delighted with the extent of his views, and the artificer with the readine&s;s of his hands; but let the one remember, that, without mechanical performances, refined &s;peculation is an empty dream, and the other, that, without theoretical rea&s;oning, dexterity is little more than a brute in&s;tinct.</P>

I &s;aw their looks clouded at the beginning of every game with an uniform &s;olicitude, now and then in its progre&s;s varied with a &s;hort triumph, at &s;ometimes wrinkled with cunning, at others deadened with de&s;pondency, or by accident flu&s;hed with rage at the un&s;kilful or unlucky play of a partner. From &s;uch a&s;|&s;emblies, in whatever humour I happened to enter them, I was quickly forced to retire;
<PB N="82" REF="83">
they were too trifling for me, when I was grave and too dull, when I was chearful.</P>
<P>YET I cannot but value my&s;elf upon this token of regard from a lady, who is not afraid to &s;tand before the torch of truth. Let her not however con&s;ult her curio&s;ity, more than her prudence; but reflect a moment on the fate of Semele, who might have lived the favorite of Jupiter, if &s;he could have been content with|out his thunder. It is dangerous for mortal beauty, or terre&s;trial virtue, to be examined by too &s;trong a light. The torch of truth &s;hows much that we cannot, and all that we would not &s;ee. In a face dimpled with &s;miles, it has often di&s;covered malevolence and envy, and detected, under jewels and brocade, the frightful forms of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. A fine hand of cards have changed before it into a thou&s;and &s;pectres of &s;ickne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and vexation; and immen&s;e &s;ums of money, while the winner counted them with tran&s;port, have at the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of this unwelcome lu&s;tre vani&s;hed from before him. If her lady&s;hip therefore de&s;igns to continue her a&s;&s;embly, I would advi&s;e her to &s;hun &s;uch dangerous ex|periments, to &s;atisfy her&s;elf with common appearances, and to light up her apartments
<PB N="83" REF="84">
rather with myrtle candles than the torch of truth.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>A MODEST young man &s;ends his &s;er|vice to the author of the Rambler, and will be very willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his work, but is &s;adly afraid of being di&s;|couraged by having his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay rejected, a di&s;grace he has wofully experienced in every offer he had made of it to every new writer of every new paper; but he comforts him&s;elf by thinking, without vanity, that this has been from a peculiar favour of the mu&s;es, who &s;aved his performance from be|ing buried in tra&s;h, and re&s;erved it to appear with lu&s;tre in the Rambler.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM equally a friend to mode&s;ty and enter|prize; and, therefore &s;hall think it an honour to corre&s;pond with a young man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both in &s;o eminent a degree. Youth is, indeed, the time in which the&s;e qualities ought chiefly to be found; mode&s;ty &s;uits well with inexpe|rience, and enterprize with health and vigour, and an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of life. One of my predece&s;&s;ors has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that, though mode&s;ty has an amiable and winning appear|ance, it ought not to hinder the exertion of
<PB N="84" REF="85">
the active powers, but that a man &s;hould &s;how under his blu&s;hes a latent re&s;olution. This point of perfection, nice as it is, my corre&s;pon|dent &s;eems to have attained. That he is mo|de&s;t, his own declaration may evince; and, I think, the <HI>latent re&s;olution</HI> may be di&s;covered in his letter by an acute ob&s;erver. I will ad|vi&s;e him, &s;ince he &s;o well de&s;erves my precepts, not to be di&s;couraged, though the Rambler &s;hould prove equally envious, or ta&s;tele&s;s, with the re&s;t of this fraternity. If his paper is refu&s;ed, the pre&s;s of England is open, let him try the judgment of the publick If, as it has &s;ome times happened, by a general com|bination again&s;t &s;uperior merit, he cannot per&s;uade the world to buy his works, he may pre&s;ent them to his friends; and if his friends are &s;eized with the epidemical infatuation, and cannot find his genius, or will not confe&s;s it, let him then refer his cau&s;e to po&s;terity, and re&s;erve his other labours for a wi&s;er age.</P>
<P>THUS have I di&s;patched &s;ome of my cor|re&s;pondents, in the u&s;ual manner, with fair words, and general civility. But to Flirtilla, the gay Flirtilla, what &s;hall I reply? Unable as I am to fly, at her command, over land and &s;eas, or to &s;upply her, from week to week,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
with the fa&s;hions of Paris, or the intrigues of Madrid, I am yet not willing to incur her farther di&s;plea&s;ure, and would &s;ave my papers from her monkey on any rea&s;onable terms. By what propitiation, therefore, may I atone for my former gravity, and open, without trembling, the future letters of this &s;prightly per&s;ecutor? To write in defence of ma&s;que|des is no ea&s;y ta&s;k; yet &s;omething difficult and daring may well be required, as the price of &s;o important an approbation. I therefore con&s;ulted, in this great emergency, a man of high reputation in gay life, who having added, to his other accompli&s;hments, no mean pro|ficiency in the minute philo&s;ophy, after the fifth peru&s;al of her letter, broke out with rap|ture into the&s;e words: 'And can you, Mr Rambler, &s;tand out again&s;t this charm|ing creature? Let her know, at lea&s;t, that from this moment Nigrinus devotes his life and his labours to her &s;ervice. Is there any &s;tubborn prejudice of education, that &s;tands between thee and the mo&s;t amiable of mankind? Behold, Flirtilla, at thy feet, a man grown grey in the &s;tudy of tho&s;e noble arts, by which right and wrong may be confounded; by which rea&s;on may be blinded, when we have a mind to e&s;cape
<PB N="86" REF="87">
from her in&s;pection, and caprice and appetite in&s;tated in uncontroulled command, and boundle&s;s dominion! Such a ca&s;ui&s;t may &s;urely engage, with certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, in vindication of an entertainment, which in an in&s;tant gives confidence to the timorous, and kindles ardour in the cold; and enter|tainment where the vigilance of jealou&s;y has &s;o often been eluded, and the virgin is &s;et free from the nece&s;&s;ity of langui&s;hing in &s;ilence; where all the outworks of cha&s;tity are at once demoli&s;hed; where the heart is laid open without a blu&s;h; where ba&s;hful|ne&s;s may &s;urvive virtue, and no wi&s;h is cru&s;h'd under the frown of mode&s;ty. Far weaker influence than Flirtilla's might gain over an advocate for &s;uch amu&s;ements. It was declared by Pompey, that, if the com|mon-wealth was violated, he could &s;tamp with his foot, and rai&s;e an army out of the ground; if the rights of plea&s;ure are again invaded, let but Flirtilla crack her fan, no pens, nor &s;words, &s;hall be wanting at the &s;ummons; the wit and the colonel &s;hall march out at her command, and neither law nor rea&s;on &s;hall &s;tand before us.'</P>

<P>THE maxim which Periander of Corinth, one of the &s;even &s;ages of Greece, left as a memorial of his knowledge and benevolence was <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Be ma&s;ter of thy anger.</HI> He con&s;idered anger as the great di&s;turber of human life, the chief enemy both of publick happine&s;s and private tranquillity, and therefore thought that he could not lay on po&s;terity a &s;tronger obligation to reverence his memory, than by leaving them a &s;alutary caution again&s;t this outrageous pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO what latitude Periander might extend the word, the brevity of his precept will &s;carce allow us to conjecture. From anger, in its full import, protracted into malevolence, and exerted in revenge, ari&s;e, indeed, many of the
<PB N="88" REF="89">
evils to which the life of man is expo&s;ed. By anger operating upon power are produced the &s;ubver&s;ion of cities, the de&s;olation of coun|tries, the ma&s;&s;acre of nations, and all tho&s;e dreadful and a&s;toni&s;hing calamities which fill the hi&s;tories of the world, and which could not be read at any di&s;tant point of time, when the pa&s;&s;ions &s;tand neutral, and every motive and principle is le&s;t to its natural force, with|out &s;ome doubt of the veracity of the relation, did we not &s;ee the &s;ame cau&s;es &s;till tending to the &s;ame effects, and only acting with le&s;s vigour for want of the &s;ame concurrent op|portunities.</P>
<P>BUT this gigantick and enormous &s;pecies of anger falls not properly under the animadver|&s;ion of a writer, who&s;e chief end is the re|gulation of common life, and who&s;e precepts are to recommend them&s;elves by their general u&s;e. Nor is this e&s;&s;ay intended to expo&s;e the tragical or fatal effects even of private malig|nity. The anger which I propo&s;e now for my &s;ubject is &s;uch as makes tho&s;e who indulge it more trouble&s;ome than formidable, and ranks them rather with hornets and wa&s;ps, than with ba&s;ili&s;ks and lions. I have, there|fore; prefixed a motto, which characteri&s;es
<PB N="89" REF="90">
this pa&s;&s;ion, not &s;o much by the mi&s;chief that it cau&s;es, as by the noi&s;e that it utters.</P>
<P>THERE is in the world a certain cla&s;s of mortals, known, and contentedly known, by the appellation of <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate men,</HI> who imagine them&s;elves entitled by that di&s;tinction to be provoked on every &s;light occa&s;ion, and to vent their rage in vehement and fierce vocifera|tions, in furious menaces and licentious re|proaches. Their rage, indeed, for the mo&s;t part, fumes away in outcries of injury, and prote&s;tations of vengeance, and &s;eldom pro|ceeds to actual violence, unle&s;s a drawer or link-boy falls in their way; but they interrupt the quiet of tho&s;e that happen to be within the reach of their clamours, di&s;turb the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, and interrupt the enjoyment of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MEN of this kind are &s;ometimes not with|out under&s;tanding or virtue &s;ufficient to re|commend them to love and regard, and are, therefore, not always treated with the &s;everity which their neglect of the ea&s;e of all about them might ju&s;tly provoke; they have ob|tained a kind of pre&s;cription for their folly, and being con&s;idered by their companions as
<PB N="90" REF="91">
under a predominant influence that leaves them no ma&s;ters of their conduct or their language, as acting without thought, and ru&s;h|ing into mi&s;chief with a mi&s;t before their eyes, they are pitied rather than cen&s;ured, and their &s;allies are pa&s;&s;ed over as the involun|tary blows of a man agitated by the &s;pa&s;ms of a convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is &s;urely not to be ob&s;erved without in|dignation, that men are to be found of minds mean enough to be &s;atisfied with this treatment; wretches who are proud to obtain the privilege of madmen, and can, without &s;hame, and without regret, con&s;ider them&s;elves as receiv|ing hourly pardons from their companions, and giving them continual opportunities of exerci&s;ing their patience, and boa&s;ting their clemency.</P>
<P>PRIDE is undoubtedly the original of anger; but pride, like every other pa&s;&s;ion, if it once breaks loo&s;e from rea&s;on, counteracts its own purpo&s;es. A pa&s;&s;ionate man, upon the review of his day, will have very few gratifications to offer to his pride, when he has con&s;idered how his outrages were cau&s;ed, why they were
<PB N="91" REF="92">
born, and in what they are likely to end at la&s;t.</P>
<P>THOSE &s;udden bur&s;ts of rage generally break out upon &s;mall occa&s;ions; for life, un|happy as it is, cannot &s;upply great evils as frequently as the man of fire thinks fit to be enraged; and therefore the fir&s;t reflection upon his violence mu&s;t &s;how him that he is mean enough to be driven from his po&s;t by every petty incident, that he is the mere &s;lave of trivial chances, and that his rea&s;on and his virtue are in the power of the wind.</P>
<P>ONE motive there is of the&s;e loud extrava|gancies, which a man is generally careful to conceal from others, and, perhaps, does not always di&s;cover to him&s;elf. He that finds his knowledge narrow, and his arguments weak, and, by con&s;equence, his &s;uffrage not much regarded in que&s;tions accurately examined, and &s;eriou&s;ly debated, is &s;ometimes in hope of gaining that attention by his clamours, which he cannot otherwi&s;e obtain, and is plea&s;ed with remembring that at lea&s;t he made him|&s;elf heard, that he had the power to interrupt tho&s;e whom he could not confute, and &s;u&s;pend the deci&s;ion which he could not guide.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
OF this kind is the fury to which many men give way among their &s;ervants and do|me&s;ticks; they feel their own ignorance, they &s;ee their own in&s;ignificance, and, therefore, they endeavour, by their fury, to fright away contempt from before them, when they know it mu&s;t follow them behind, and think them|&s;elves eminently ma&s;ters, when they &s;ee one folly tamely complied with, only for fear le&s;t refu&s;al or delay &s;hould provoke them to a greater.</P>
<P>THESE temptations cannot but be owned to have &s;ome force, and it is &s;o little plea&s;ing to any man to &s;ee him&s;elf wholly overlooked in the ma&s;s of things, that he may be allowed to try a few expedients for procuring &s;ome kind of &s;upplemental dignity, and to endeavour to add weight by the violence of his temper, to the lightne&s;s of his other powers. But this has now been long practi&s;ed, and found, upon the mo&s;t exact e&s;timate, not to pro|duce advantages equal to its inconveniences; for it has not appeared that a man has by up|roar, and tumult, and blu&s;ter, altered any one's opinion of his under&s;tanding, or been able to gain any influence except over tho&s;e
<PB N="93" REF="94">
whom fortune or nature have made his depen|dents. He may by a &s;teady per&s;everance in his ferocity fright his children, and harra&s;s his &s;ervants, but all the re&s;t of the world will look on and laugh; and he will have the comfort at la&s;t of thinking, that he lives only to rai&s;e contempt and hatred, emotions to which wi&s;dom and virtue would be always unwilling to give occa&s;ion. He will find that he has contrived only to make tho&s;e fear him, whom every rea&s;onable being is endeavouring to endear by kindne&s;s, and mu&s;t content him&s;elf with the plea&s;ure of a triumph obtained by trampling on tho&s;e who could not re&s;i&s;t him. He mu&s;t perceive that the apprehen&s;ion which his pre&s;ence cau&s;es is not the awe of his virtue, but the dread of his brutality, and that he has given up the felicity of being loved, without gaining the honour of being reverenced.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the only ill con&s;equence of the frequent indulgence of this blu&s;tering pa&s;&s;ion, which a man, by often calling to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will teach, in a &s;hort time, to intrude before the &s;ummons, to ru&s;h upon him with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s violence, and without any previous notice of its approach. He will find him&s;elf liable to be inflamed at the fir&s;t touch of provocation, and
<PB N="94" REF="95">
unable to retain his re&s;entment, till he has a full conviction of the offence, to proportion his anger to the cau&s;e, or to regulate it by pru|dence, or by duty. When a man has once &s;uffered his mind to be thus vitiated, he be|comes one of the mo&s;t hateful and unhappy beings. He can give no &s;ecurity to him&s;elf that he &s;hall not, at the next interview, alienate by &s;ome &s;udden tran&s;port his deare&s;t friend; or break out, upon &s;ome &s;light contradiction, into &s;uch terms of rudene&s;s as can never be perfectly forgotten. Whoever conver&s;es with him lives with the &s;u&s;picion and &s;olicitude of a man that plays with a tame tiger, always under a nece&s;&s;ity of watching the moment, in which the capricious &s;avage &s;hall begin to growl.</P>
<P>IT is told by Prior, in a panegyrick on lord Dor&s;et, that his &s;ervants u&s;ed to put them&s;elves in his way when he was angry, becau&s;e he was &s;ure to recompen&s;e them for any indigni|ties which he made them &s;uffer. This is the round of a pa&s;&s;ionate man's life; he contracts debts when he is furious, which his virtue, if he has virtue, obliges him to di&s;charge at the return of rea&s;on. He &s;pends his time in outrage and acknowledgement, injury and
<PB N="95" REF="96">
reparation. Or, if there be any who hardens him&s;elf in oppre&s;&s;ion, and ju&s;tifies the wrong, becau&s;e he has done it, his in&s;en&s;ibility can make &s;mall part of his prai&s;e, or his happine&s;s; he only adds deliberate to ha&s;ty folly, aggra|vates petulance by contumacy, and de&s;troys the only plea that he can offer for the tender|ne&s;s and patience of mankind.</P>
<P>YET, even this degree of depravity we may be content to pity, becau&s;e it &s;eldom wants a puni&s;hment equal to its guilt. No|thing is more de&s;picable or more mi&s;erable than the old age of a pa&s;&s;ionate man. When the vigour of youth fails him, and his amu&s;ements pall with frequent repetition, his occa&s;ional rage &s;inks by decay of &s;trength into peevi&s;h|ne&s;s, that peevi&s;hne&s;s, for want of novelty and variety, becomes habitual; the world falls off from around him, and he is left, as Homer expre&s;&s;es it, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, to devour his own heart in &s;olitude and contempt.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you &s;eem to have devoted your labours to virtue, I cannot forbear to inform you of one &s;pecies of cruelty, with which the life of a man of letters perhaps does not often make him acquainted, and which, as it &s;eems to produce no other advantage to tho&s;e that practi&s;e it than a &s;hort gratification of thoughtle&s;s vanity, may become le&s;s com|mon when it has been once expo&s;ed in its various forms, and its full magnitude.</P>
<P>I AM the daughter of a country gentleman, who&s;e family is numerous, and who&s;e e&s;tate, not at fir&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;upply us with affluence,
<PB N="97" REF="98">
has been lately &s;o much impaired by an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful law&s;uit, that all the younger children are obliged to try &s;uch means as their educa|tion affords them, for procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Di&s;tre&s;s and curio&s;ity concurred to bring me to London, where I was received by a relation with the coldne&s;s which misfortune generally finds. A week, a long week, I lived with my cou&s;in, before the mo&s;t vigilant enquiry could procure us the lea&s;t hopes of a place, in which time I was much better qua|lified to bear all the vexations of &s;ervitude. The fir&s;t two days &s;he was content to pity me, and only wi&s;h'd I had not been quite &s;o well bred, but people mu&s;t comply with their circum&s;tances. This lenity, however, was &s;oon at an end; and, for the remaining part of the week, I heard every hour of the pride of my family, the ob&s;tinacy of my father, and of people better born than my&s;elf that were com|mon &s;ervants.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, on Saturday noon, &s;he told me, with very vi&s;ible &s;atisfaction, that Mrs Bom|ba&s;ine, the great &s;ilk-mercer's lady, wanted a maid, and a fine place it would be, for there would be nothing to do but to clean my mi&s;tre&s;s's room, get up her linen, dre&s;s the young ladies, wait at tea in the morning,
<PB N="8" REF="99">
take care of a little mi&s;s ju&s;t come from nur&s;e, and then &s;it down to my needle. But madam was a woman of great &s;pirit, and would not be contradicted, and therefore I &s;hould take care, for good places were not ea&s;ily to be got.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e cautions, I waited on madam Bomba&s;ine, of whom the fir&s;t &s;ight gave me no ravi&s;hing ideas. She was two yards round the wai&s;t, her voice was at once loud and &s;queaking, and her face brought to my mind the picture of the full-moon. Are you the young woman, &s;ays &s;he, that are come to offer your&s;elf? It is &s;trange when people of &s;ub&s;tance want a &s;ervant, how &s;oon it is the town-talk. But they know they &s;hall have a belly-full that live with me. Not like people at the other end of the town, we dine at one o'clock. But I never take any body without a character; what friends do you come of? I then told her that my father was a gentleman, and that we had been unfortunate.&mdash;A great misfortune, indeed, to come to me and have three meals a-day!&mdash;So your father was a gentleman, and you are a gentlewoman I &s;up|po&s;e&mdash;&s;uch gentlewomen!&mdash;Madam, I did not mean to claim any exemptions, I only an&s;wered
<PB N="99" REF="100">
your enquiry.&mdash;Such gentlewomen! people &s;hould &s;et their children to good trades, and keep them off the pari&s;h. Pray go to the o|ther end of the town, there are gentlewomen, if they would pay their debts: I am &s;ure we have lo&s;t enough by gentlewomen. Upon this, her broad face grew broader with triumph, and I was afraid &s;he would have taken me for the plea&s;ure of continuing her in&s;ult; but happily the next word was, Pray, Mrs gentle|woman, troop down &s;tairs. You may believe I obeyed her.</P>
<P>I RETURNED and met with a better recep|tion from my cou&s;in than I expected; for while I was out, &s;he had heard that Mrs Stan|di&s;h, who&s;e hu&s;band had lately been rai&s;ed from a clerk in an office, to be commi&s;&s;ioner of the exci&s;e, had taken a fine hou&s;e, and wanted a maid.</P>
<P>TO Mrs Standi&s;h I went, and, after having waited &s;ix hours, was at la&s;t admitted to the top of the &s;tairs, when &s;he came out of her room, with two of her company. There was a &s;mell of punch. So young woman, you want a place, whence do you come?&mdash;From the country, madam.&mdash;Yes, they all come out of
<PB N="100" REF="101">
the country. And what brought you to town, a ba&s;tard? Where do you lodge? At the Seven-Dials? What, you never heard of the foundling hou&s;e? Upon this, they all laughed &s;o ob&s;treperou&s;ly, that I took the opportunity of &s;neaking off in the tumult.</P>
<P>I THEN heard of a place at an elderly lady's. She was at cards; but in two hours, I was told, &s;he would &s;peak to me. She a&s;ked me if I could keep an account, and ordered me to write. I wrote two lines out of &s;ome book that lay by her. She wonder'd what people meant, to breed up poor girls to write at that rate. I &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs Flirt, if I was to &s;ee your work, it would be fine &s;tuff!&mdash;You may walk. I will not have love-letters written from my hou&s;e to every young fellow in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>TWO days after, I went on the &s;ame per&s;uit to lady Lofty, dre&s;&s;ed, as I was directed, in what little ornaments I had, becau&s;e &s;he had lately got a place at court. Upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of me, &s;he turns to the woman that &s;howed me in, Is this the lady that wants a place? Pray what place wou'd you have, mi&s;s? a maid of honour's place? Servants now a|days!&mdash;Madam, I heard you wanted-Wanted
<PB N="101" REF="102">

<P>I WENT to enquire for the next place in a clean linen gown, and heard the &s;ervant tell his lady, there was a young woman, but he &s;aw &s;he would not do. I was brought up however.

I WENT away with tears; for my cou&s;in had lo&s;t all patience. However &s;he told me, that &s;he had a re&s;pect for my relations, was willing to keep me out of the &s;treet, and would let me have another week.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t day of this week I &s;aw two places. At one I was a&s;ked where I had lived? And upon my an&s;wer, was told by the lady, that people &s;hould qualify them&s;elves in ordinary places, for &s;he &s;hould never have done if &s;he was to follow girls about. At the other hou&s;e, I was a &s;mirking hu&s;&s;y, and that &s;weet face I might make money of&mdash;For her part, it was a rule with her, never to take any creature that thought her&s;elf hand&s;ome.</P>

<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
MY week was now near its end, and I had no hopes of a place. My relation, who al|ways laid upon me the blame of every mi&s;|carriage, told me that I mu&s;t learn to humble my&s;elf, and that all great ladies had particular ways; that if I went on in that manner, &s;he could not tell who would keep me; &s;he had known many that had refu&s;ed places, &s;ell their cloaths, and beg in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>IT was to no purpo&s;e that the refu&s;al was declared by me to be never on my &s;ide; I was rea&s;oning again&s;t intere&s;t, and again&s;t &s;tupidity; and therefore I comforted my&s;elf with the hope of &s;ucceeding better in my next attempt, and went to Mrs Courtly, a very fine lady, who had routs at her hou&s;e, and &s;aw the be&s;t company in town.</P>
<P>I HAD not waited two hours before I was called up, and found Mr Courtly and his lady at piquet, in the height of good humour. This I looked on as a favourable &s;ign, and &s;tood at the lower end of the room in expectation of the common que&s;tions. At la&s;t Mr Courtly call'd out, after a whi&s;per, Stand facing the light, that one may &s;ee you. I chang'd my
<PB N="104" REF="105">
place, and blu&s;h'd. They frequently turn'd their eyes upon me, and &s;eem'd to di&s;cover many &s;ubjects of merriment; for at every look they whi&s;per'd, and laugh'd with the mo&s;t violent agitations of delight. At la&s;t Mr Courtly cried out, Is that colour your own, child? Yes, &s;ays the lady, if &s;he has not robb'd the kitchen hearth. This was &s;o happy a conceit, that it renew'd the &s;torm of laugh|ter, and they threw down their cards in hopes of better &s;port. The lady then called me to her, and began with an affected gravity to enquire what I could do? But fir&s;t turn about, and let us &s;ee your fine &s;hape; Well, what are you fit for, Mrs Mum? You would find your tongue, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the kitchen. No, no, &s;ays Mr Courtly, the girl's a good girl yet, but I am afraid a bri&s;k young fellow, with fine tags on his &s;houlder&mdash;Come, child, hold up your head; what? you have &s;tole nothing&mdash;Not yet, &s;ays the lady, but &s;he hopes to &s;teal your heart quickly.&mdash;Here was a laugh of happine&s;s and triumph, prolonged by the confu&s;ion which I could no longer repre&s;s. At la&s;t the lady recollected her&s;elf: Stole? no&mdash;but if I had her, I &s;hould watch her; for that downca&s;t eye&mdash;Why cannot you look people in the face?
<PB N="105" REF="106">
Steal! &s;ays her hu&s;band, &s;he would &s;teal no|thing but, perhaps, a few ribbands before they were left off by her lady. Sir, an&s;wer'd I, why &s;hould you, by &s;uppo&s;ing me a thief, in&s;ult one from whom you have received no injury? In&s;ult, &s;ays the lady; are you come here to be a &s;ervant, you &s;aucy baggage, and talk of in&s;ulting? What will this world come to, if a gentleman may not je&s;t with a &s;ervant? Well, &s;uch &s;ervants! pray be gone, and &s;ee when you will have the honour to be &s;o in&s;ulted again. Servants in&s;ulted&mdash;a fine time.&mdash;In|&s;ulted! Get down &s;tairs, you &s;lut, or the foot|man &s;hall in&s;ult you.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t day of the la&s;t week was now coming, and my kind cou&s;in talked of &s;ending me down in the waggon to pre&s;erve me from bad cour&s;es. But in the morning &s;he came and told me that &s;he had one trial more for me, Euphemia wanted a maid, and perhaps I might do for her; for, like me, &s;he mu&s;t fall her cre&s;t, being forced to lay down her chariot upon the lo&s;s of half her fortune by bad &s;ecurities, and with her way of giving her money to every body that pretended to want it, &s;he could have little beforehand; therefore I
<PB N="106" REF="107">
might &s;erve her; for, with all her fine &s;en&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t not pretend to be nice.</P>
<P>I WENT immediately, and met at the door a young gentlewoman, who told me &s;he had her&s;elf been hired that morning, but that &s;he was order'd to bring any that offered up &s;tairs. I was accordingly introduced to Euphemia, who, when I came in, laid down her book, and told me, that &s;he &s;ent for me not to gratify an idle curio&s;ity, but le&s;t my di&s;|appointment might be made &s;till more gra|ting by incivility; that &s;he was in pain to deny any thing, much more what was no favour; that &s;he &s;aw nothing in my appear|ance which did not make her wi&s;h for my company; but that another, who&s;e claims might perhaps be equal, had come before me. The thought of being &s;o near to &s;uch a place, and mi&s;&s;ing it, brought tears into my eyes, and my &s;obs hinder'd me from re|turning my acknowledgments. She ro&s;e up confu&s;ed, and &s;uppo&s;ing by my concern that I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, placed me by her, and made me tell her my &s;tory: which when &s;he had heard, &s;he put two guineas in my hand, ordering me to lodge near her, and make u&s;e of her table till &s;he could provide

for me. I am now under her protection, and know not how to &s;hew my gratitude better than by giving this account to the RAMBLER.</P>

<P>IT is related by Quintus Curtius, that the Per&s;ians always conceived a la&s;ting and invincible contempt of a man, who had viola|ted the laws of &s;ecrecy; for they thought, that, however he might be deficient in the qualities requi&s;ite to actual excellence, the ne|gative virtues at lea&s;t were always in his power, and though he perhaps could not &s;peak well if he was to try, it was &s;till ea&s;y for him not to &s;peak.</P>
<P>IN this opinion of the ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;ecrecy, they &s;eem to have con&s;ider'd it as oppo&s;ed, not to treachery, but loquacity, and to have conceived the man, whom they thus cen&s;ured, not frighted by menaces to reveal, or bribed
<PB N="108" REF="109">
by promi&s;es to betray, but incited by the mere plea&s;ure of talking, or &s;ome other motive equal|ly trivial, to lay open his heart without reflecti|on, and to let whatever he knew &s;lip from him, only for want of power to retain it. Whe|ther, by their &s;ettled and avowed &s;corn of thoughtle&s;s talkers, the Per&s;ians were able to diffu&s;e to any great extent the virtue of tacitur|nity, we are hindered by the di&s;tance of tho&s;e times from being able to di&s;cover, there being very few memoirs remaining of the court of Per&s;epolis, nor any di&s;tinct accounts handed down to us of their office clerks, their ladies of the bed-chamber, their attorneys, their cham|ber-maids, or their footmen.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e latter ages, though the old animo&s;i|ty again&s;t a prattler is &s;till retained, it appears wholly to have lo&s;t its effects upon the con|duct of mankind; for &s;ecrets are &s;o &s;eldom kept, that it may with &s;ome rea&s;on be doubted, whether the antients were not mi&s;taken in their fir&s;t po&s;tulate, whether the quality of re|tention be &s;o generally be&s;towed, and whether a &s;ecret has not &s;ome &s;ubtle volatility, by which it e&s;capes almo&s;t imperceptibly at the &s;malle&s;t vent; or &s;ome power of fermentation, by
<PB N="109" REF="110">
which it expands it&s;elf &s;o as to bur&s;t the heart that will not give it way.</P>
<P>THOSE that &s;tudy either the body or the mind of man, very often find the mo&s;t &s;pecious and plea&s;ing theory falling under the weight of contrary experience; and in&s;tead of grati|fying their vanity by inferring effects from cau|&s;es, they are always reduced at la&s;t to conjecture cau&s;es from effects. That it is ea&s;y to be &s;ecret the &s;peculati&s;t can demon&s;trate in his retreat, and therefore thinks him&s;elf ju&s;tified in placing confidence; the man of the world knows, that, whether difficult or not, it is uncommon, and therefore finds him&s;elf rather inclined to &s;earch after the rea&s;on of this univer&s;al failure in one of the mo&s;t important duties of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE vanity of being known to be tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret is generally one of the chief mo|tives to di&s;clo&s;e it; for however ab&s;urd it may be thought to boa&s;t an honour, by an act which &s;hews that it was conferred without me|rit, yet mo&s;t men &s;eem rather inclined to con|fe&s;s the want of virtue than of importance, and more willingly &s;hew their influence and their power, though at the expence of their probity, than glide through life with no other plea&s;ure
<PB N="110" REF="111">
than the private con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of fidelity; which, while it is pre&s;erved, mu&s;t be without prai&s;e, except from the &s;ingle per&s;on who tries and knows it.</P>
<P>THERE are many ways of telling a &s;ecret, by which a man exempts him&s;elf from the reproaches of his con&s;cience, and gratifies his pride without &s;uffering him&s;elf to believe that he impairs his virtue. He tells the private af|fairs of his patron, or his friend, only to tho&s;e from whom he would not conceal his own; he tells them to tho&s;e, who have no temptation to betray their tru&s;t, or with a denunciation of a certain forfeiture of his friend&s;hip, if he di&s;co|vers that they become public.</P>
<P>SECRETS are very frequently told in the fir&s;t ardour of kindne&s;s, or of love, for the &s;ake of proving, by &s;o important a &s;acrifice, the &s;incerity of profe&s;&s;ions, or the warmth of ten|derne&s;s; but with this motive, though it be &s;ometimes &s;trong in it&s;elf, vanity generally concurs, &s;ince every man naturally de&s;ires to be mo&s;t e&s;teemed by tho&s;e whom he loves, or with whom he conver&s;es, with whom he pa&s;|&s;es his hours of plea&s;ure, and to whom he re|tires from bu&s;ine&s;s and from care.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">
WHEN the di&s;covery of &s;ecrets is under con&s;ideration, there is always a di&s;tinction carefully to be made between our own and tho&s;e of another, tho&s;e of which we are fully ma&s;ters as they affect only our own intere&s;t, and tho&s;e which are repo&s;ited with us in tru&s;t, and involve the happine&s;s or convenience of &s;uch as we have no right to expo&s;e to hazard by experiments upon their lives, without their con&s;ent. To tell our own &s;ecrets is generally folly, but that folly is without guilt; to com|municate tho&s;e with which we are intru&s;ted is always treachery, and treachery for the mo&s;t part combined with folly.</P>
<P>THERE have, indeed, been &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic and irrational zealots for friend&s;hip, who have maintained, and perhaps believed, that one friend has a right to all that is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another; and that therefore it is a violation of kindne&s;s to exempt any &s;ecret from this bound|le&s;s confidence: Accordingly a late female mi|ni&s;ter of &s;tate has been &s;hamele&s;s enough to inform the world, that &s;he u&s;ed, when &s;he wanted to extract any thing from her &s;overeign, to remind her of Montaigne's rea&s;oning, who has determined, that to tell a &s;ecret to a friend
<PB N="112" REF="113">
is no breach of fidelity, becau&s;e the number of per&s;ons tru&s;ted is not multiplied, a man and his friend being virtually the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THAT &s;uch a fallacy could be impo&s;ed upon any human under&s;tanding, or that an author could have been imagined to advance a po&s;iti|on &s;o remote from truth and rea&s;on, any other|wi&s;e than as a declaimer, to &s;hew to what ex|tent he could &s;tretch his imagination, and with what &s;trength he could pre&s;s his principle, would &s;carcely have been credible, had not this lady kindly &s;hewn us how far weakne&s;s may be deluded, or indolence amu&s;ed. But &s;ince it appears, that even this &s;ophi&s;try has been able, with the help of a &s;trong de&s;ire to repo&s;e in quiet upon the under&s;tanding of an|other, to mi&s;lead hone&s;t intentions, and an under&s;tanding not contemptible, it may not be &s;uperfluous to remark, that tho&s;e things which are common among friends are only &s;uch as either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in his own right, and can alienate or de&s;troy without injury to any other per&s;on. Without this limitation, con|fidence mu&s;t run on without end, the &s;econd per&s;on may tell the &s;ecret to the third upon the &s;ame principle as he received it from the
<PB N="113" REF="114">
fir&s;t, and the third may hand it forward to a fourth, till at la&s;t it is told in the round of friend&s;hip to them from whom it was the fir&s;t intention chiefly to conceal it.</P>
<P>THE confidence which Caius has of the faithfulne&s;s of Titius is nothing more than an opinion which him&s;elf cannot know to be true, and which Claudius, who fir&s;t tells his &s;ecret to Caius may know, at lea&s;t may &s;u&s;pect to be fal&s;e; and therefore the tru&s;t is transfer|red by Caius, if he reveal what has been told him, to one from whom the per&s;on originally concerned would probably have withheld it; and, whatever may be the event, Caius has hazarded the happine&s;s of his friend, without nece&s;&s;ity and without permi&s;&s;ion, and has put that tru&s;t in the hand of fortune which was given only to virtue.</P>
<P>ALL the arguments upon which a man who is telling the private affairs of another may ground his confidence of &s;ecurity, he mu&s;t upon reflection know to be uncertain, becau&s;e he finds them without effect upon him&s;elf. When he is imagining that Titius will be cau|tious from a regard to his intere&s;t, his reputati|on, or his duty, he ought to reflect that he is
<PB N="114" REF="115">
him&s;elf at that in&s;tant acting in oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and revealing what intere&s;t, reputation, and duty direct him to conceal.</P>
<P>EVERY one feels that he &s;hould con&s;ider the man incapable of tru&s;t, who believed him|&s;elf at liberty to tell whatever he knew to the fir&s;t whom he &s;hould conclude de&s;erving of his confidence; therefore Caius, in admitting Titius to the affairs imparted only to him&s;elf, violates his faith, &s;ince he acts contrary to the intention of Claudius, to whom that faith was given. For promi&s;es of friend&s;hip are, like all others, u&s;ele&s;s and vain, unle&s;s they are made in &s;ome known &s;en&s;e, adju&s;ted and acknowledged by both parties.</P>
<P>I AM not ignorant that many que&s;tions may be &s;tarted relating to the duty of &s;ecrecy, where the affairs are of publick concern; where &s;ub&s;equent rea&s;ons may ari&s;e to alter the appearance and nature of the tru&s;t; that the manner in which the &s;ecret was told may change the degree of obligation; and that the principles upon which a man is cho&s;en for a confident may not always equally con&s;train him. But the&s;e &s;cruples, if not too intricate, are of too exten&s;ive con&s;ideration for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
nor are they &s;uch as generally occur in common life; and though ca&s;ui&s;tical knowledge be u&s;eful in proper hands, yet it ought by no means to be carele&s;ly expo&s;ed, &s;ince mo&s;t will u&s;e it rather to lull than awaken their own con&s;ciences; and the threads of rea&s;oning, on which truth is &s;u&s;pended, are frequently drawn to &s;uch &s;ubtility, that common eyes cannot per|ceive, and common &s;en&s;ibility cannot feel them.</P>
<P>THE whole doctrine as well as practice of &s;ecrecy, is &s;o perplexing and dangerous, that, next to him who is compelled to tru&s;t, I think him unhappy who is cho&s;en to be tru&s;ted; for he is often involved in &s;cruples without the liberty of calling in the help of any other under&s;tanding, he is frequently drawn into guilt, under the appearance of friend&s;hip and hone&s;ty; and &s;ometimes &s;ubjected to &s;u&s;picion by the treachery of others, who are engaged without his knowledge in the &s;ame &s;chemes, for he that has one confident has generally more, and when he is at la&s;t betrayed, is in doubt on whom he &s;hall fix the crime.</P>
<P>THE rules therefore that I &s;hall propo&s;e concerning &s;ecrecy, and from which I think it not &s;afe to deviate, without long and exact
<PB N="116" REF="117">
deliberation, are&mdash;Never to &s;olicit the know|ledge of a &s;ecret. Not willingly, nor without many limitations, to accept &s;uch confidence when it is offered. When a &s;ecret is once ad|mitted, to con&s;ider the tru&s;t as of a very high nature, important as &s;ociety, and &s;acred as truth, and therefore not to be violated for any incidental convenience, or &s;light appearance of contrary fitne&s;s.</P>

<P>AMONG the many incon&s;i&s;tencies which folly produces, or infirmity &s;uffers in the human mind, there has often been ob&s;er|ved a manife&s;t and &s;triking contrariety between the life of an author and his writings; and Milton, in a letter to a learned &s;tranger, by whom he had been vi&s;ited, with great rea&s;on congratulates him&s;elf upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being found equal to his own character, and having pre&s;erved in a private and familiar interview that reputation which his works had procured him.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
THOSE whom the appearance of virtue, or the evidence of genius, have tempted to a nearer knowledge of the writer in who&s;e per|formances they may be found, have, indeed, had frequent rea&s;on to repent their curio&s;ity; the bubble that &s;parkled before them has be|come common water at the touch, and the phantom of perfection has vani&s;hed when they wi&s;hed to pre&s;s it to their bo&s;om. They have lo&s;t the plea&s;ure of imagining how far humani|ty may be exalted, and, perhaps, feel them|&s;elves le&s;s inclined to toil up the &s;leeps of vir|tue, when they ob&s;erve tho&s;e who &s;eem be&s;t able to point the way loitering below, as either afraid of the labour, or doubtful of the reward.</P>
<P>IT has been long the cu&s;tom of the oriental monarchs to hide them&s;elves in their gardens and their palaces, to avoid the conver&s;ation of mankind, and to be known to their &s;ubjects only by their edicts. The &s;ame policy is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to him that writes, than to him that governs; for men would, not more pa|tiently &s;ubmit to be taught, than commanded, by one, who &s;hould be known to have the &s;ame follies and weakne&s;&s;es with them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119">
Perhaps, a &s;udden intruder into the clo&s;et of an author would feel equal &s;urpri&s;e and indignati|on with the officer, who having long &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion into the pre&s;ence of Sardanapalus, &s;aw him at la&s;t not con&s;ulting upon laws, en|quiring into grievances, planning fortificati|ons, or modelling armies, but employed in feminine amu&s;ements, and directing the ladies in their work.</P>
<P>IT is not difficult to conceive, however, that for many rea&s;ons a man writes much bet|ter than he lives. For, without entering into refined &s;peculations, it is many degrees ea&s;ier to de&s;ign than to perform. A man propo&s;es his &s;chemes of life in a &s;tate of ab&s;traction and di&s;engagement, exempt from the enticements of hope, the &s;olicitations of affection, the importunities of appetite, or the depre&s;&s;ions of fear, and is in the &s;ame &s;tate with him that teaches, upon land, the art of navigation, to whom the &s;ea is always &s;mooth, and the wind is always pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>THE mathematicians are well acquainted with the difference between pure &s;cience, which has to do only with ideas, and the ap|plication of its laws to the u&s;e of life, in which
<PB N="119" REF="120">
they are con&s;trained to &s;ubmit to the imper|fection of matter and the influence of acci|dents: thus, in moral di&s;cu&s;&s;ions it is to be remembred that many impediments ob&s;truct our practice, which very ea&s;ily give way to theory. The &s;peculati&s;t is only in danger of error, but the man involved in life has his own pa&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e of others, to encounter, and is embarra&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;and inconveni|ences on every &s;ide, which confound him with variety of impul&s;e, and either perplex or ob&s;truct his way. He is often forced to act without deliberation, and obliged to choo&s;e before he can examine; he is often &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;udden alterations of the &s;tate of things, and changes his mea&s;ures according to &s;uperficial appearances; he is often led by others, either becau&s;e he is indolent, or becau&s;e he is timo|rous; he is &s;ometimes afraid to know what is right, and &s;ometimes finds others diligent to deceive him.</P>
<P>WE are, therefore, not to wonder that mo&s;t fail, amid&s;t tumult, and &s;nares, and danger, in the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e precepts, which they laid down in &s;olitude, &s;afety, and tranquillity, with a mind unbia&s;&s;ed, and with liberty unob&s;tructed. It is the condition of
<PB N="120" REF="121">

<P>IT is, however, nece&s;&s;ary for the idea of perfection to be propo&s;ed, that we may have &s;ome object to which our endeavours are to be directed; and he that is mo&s;t deficient in the duties of life, makes &s;ome atonement for his faults, by warning others again&s;t his own fail|ings, and endeavouring by the &s;alubrity of his admonitions to hinder the contagion of his example.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more unrea&s;onable, however common, than to charge with hypocri&s;y him that expre&s;&s;es zeal for tho&s;e virtues, which he neglects to practi&s;e; &s;ince he may be &s;incerely convinced of the advantages of conquering his pa&s;&s;ions, without having yet obtained the victo|ry, as a man may be confident of the advanta|ges of a voyage, or a journey, without having courage, or indu&s;try, to undertake it, and may hone&s;tly recommend to others, tho&s;e attempts which he neglects him&s;elf.</P>

THE intere&s;t which the corrupt part of mankind have in hardening them&s;elves again&s;t every motive to amendment, has di&s;po&s;ed them to give to the&s;e contradictions, when they can be produced again&s;t the cau&s;e of virtue, that weight which they will not allow them in any other ca&s;e. They &s;ee men act in oppo&s;ition to their intere&s;t, without &s;uppo&s;ing, on other oc|ca&s;ions, that they do not know it; they &s;ee them give way to the &s;udden violence of pa&s;&s;i|on, and for&s;ake the mo&s;t important per&s;uits for trivial plea&s;ures, without imagining that they have changed their &s;entiments, or ap|prove their own conduct. In moral or religi|ous que&s;tions alone, they re&s;olve to determine the &s;entiments by the actions, and charge every man with endeavouring to impo&s;e upon the world, who&s;e writings are not confirmed by his life. They never con&s;ider that they them|&s;elves neglect, or practi&s;e &s;omething every day, incon&s;i&s;tently with their own &s;ettled opinion, nor di&s;cover that the conduct of the advocates for virtue can little increa&s;e, or le&s;&s;en, the obligations of their dictates; argument is to be invalidated only by argument, and is in it&s;elf of the &s;ame force, whether or not it convinces him by whom it is propo&s;ed.</P>

YET &s;ince this prejudice, however unrea&s;on|able, is always likely to have &s;ome prevalence, it is the duty of every man to take care le&s;t he &s;hould hinder the efficacy of his own in&s;tructi|ons. When he de&s;ires to gain the belief of others, he &s;hould &s;hew that he believes him&s;elf; and when he teaches the fitne&s;s of virtue by his rea&s;onings, he &s;hould, by his example, prove its po&s;&s;ibility: Thus much at lea&s;t may be required of him, that he &s;hall not act wor&s;e than others becau&s;e he writes better, nor ima|gine that, by the merit of his genius, he may claim &s;ome indulgence beyond mortals of the lower cla&s;&s;es, and be excu&s;ed for want of pru|dence, or neglect of virtue.</P>
<P>BACON in his Hi&s;tory of the winds, after having offered &s;omething to the imagination as de&s;irable, often propo&s;es lower advantages in its place to the rea&s;on as attainable. The &s;ame method may be &s;ometimes pur&s;ued in moral endeavours, which this philo&s;opher has ob&s;er|ved in natural enquiries; and having fir&s;t &s;et po&s;itive and ab&s;olute excellence before us, we may be pardoned though we &s;ink down to humbler virtue, trying, however, to keep our point always in view, and &s;truggling
<PB N="123" REF="124">
not to lo&s;e ground, though we cannot gain it.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of Sir Matthew Hale, that he, for a long time, concealed the con&s;ecration of him&s;elf to the &s;tricter duties of religion, le&s;t, by &s;ome flagitious and &s;hameful action, he &s;hould bring piety into di&s;grace. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it may be prudent for a writer, who apprehends that he &s;hall not enforce his own maxims by his dome&s;tic character, to conceal his name that he may not injure them.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, a far greater number who&s;e curio&s;ity to gain a more familiar know|ledge of &s;ucce&s;sful writers, is not &s;o much prompted by an opinion of their power to improve as to delight, and who expect from them not arguments again&s;t vice, or di&s;&s;erta|tions on temperance or ju&s;tice, but flights of wit, &s;trains of humour, and &s;allies of plea&s;an|try, or, at lea&s;t, acute remarks, nice di&s;tincti|ons, ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment, and elegance of diction.</P>
<P>THIS expectation is, indeed, &s;pecious and probable, and yet, &s;uch is the fate of all hu|man hopes, that it is very often fru&s;trated, and
<PB N="124" REF="125">
tho&s;e who rai&s;e admiration by their books, di&s;|gu&s;t by their company. A man of letters for the mo&s;t part &s;pends, in the privacies of &s;tudy, that &s;ea&s;on of life in which the manners are to be &s;oftened into ea&s;e, and poli&s;hed into elegance, and, when he has gained knowledge enough to be re&s;pected, has neglected the minuter acts by which he might have plea&s;ed. When he enters life, if of a weak and timorous temper, he is diffident and ba&s;hful, from the know|ledge of his defects; or if he was born with &s;pirit and re&s;olution, he is ferocious and arro|gant from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his merit: he is either di&s;&s;ipated by the awe of &s;uperior com|pany, and unable to a&s;&s;emble his ideas, recol|lect his reading, and arrange his arguments; or he is hot, and dogmatical, quick in oppo|&s;ition, and tenacious in defence, di&s;abled by his own violence, and confu&s;ed by his ha&s;te to triumph.</P>
<P>THE graces of writing and conver&s;ation are of different kinds, and though he who excels in one might have been with opportunity and application equally &s;ucce&s;sful in the other, yet as many plea&s;e by extemporary talk, though utterly unacquainted with the more accurate method, and more laboured beauties, which
<PB N="125" REF="126">
compo&s;ition requires; &s;o it is very po&s;&s;ible that men, wholly accu&s;tomed to works of &s;tudy, may want that readine&s;s of conception, and affluence of language, always nece&s;&s;ary to colloquial entertainment. They may want addre&s;s to watch the hints which conver&s;ation offers for the di&s;play of their particular attain|ments, or they may be &s;o much unfurni&s;hed with matter on common &s;ubjects, that di&s;cour&s;e not profe&s;&s;edly literary glides over them as heterogeneous bodies, without admitting their conceptions to mix in the circulation.</P>
<P>A TRANSITION from an author's books to his conver&s;ation, is too often like an entrance into a large city, after a di&s;tant pro&s;pect. Re|motely, we &s;ee nothing but &s;pires of temples, and turrets of palaces, and imagine it the re|&s;idence of &s;plendor, grandeur, and magnifi|cence; but, when we have pa&s;&s;ed the gates, we find it perplexed with narrow pa&s;&s;ages, di&s;graced with de&s;picable cottages, embarra&s;&s;ed with ob&s;tructions, and clouded with &s;moke.</P>

<P>THERE &s;eems to be &s;o little knowledge left in the world, and &s;o little of that reflection practi&s;ed, by which knowledge is to be gained, that I am in doubt, whether I &s;hall be under&s;tood, when I complain of want of opportunity for thinking; or whether a condemnation, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems irre|ver&s;ible, to perpetual ignorance will rai&s;e any compa&s;&s;ion, either in you, or your readers: yet I will venture to lay my &s;tate before you, becau&s;e, I believe, it is natural, to mo&s;t minds, to take &s;ome plea&s;ure in complaining of evils, of which they have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>I AM the daughter of a man of great fortune, who&s;e diffidence of mankind, and, perhaps, the plea&s;ure of continual accumulation incline him to re&s;ide upon his own e&s;tate, and to educate his children in his own hou&s;e, where I was bred, if not with the mo&s;t brilliant examples of virtue before my eyes, at lea&s;t remote enough from any incitements to vice; and, wanting neither lei&s;ure, nor books, nor

the acquaintance of &s;ome per&s;ons of learning in the neighbourhood, I endeavour'd to acquire &s;uch knowledge as might mo&s;t recommend me to e&s;teem, and thought my&s;elf able to &s;upport a conver&s;ation upon mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects, which my &s;ex, and my condition, made it proper for me to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>I HAD, be&s;ides my knowledge, as my mamma and my maid told me, a very fine face, and elegant &s;hape, and with all the&s;e advantages had been &s;eventeen months the reigning toa&s;t for twelve miles round, and never came to the monthly a&s;&s;embly, but I heard the old ladies that &s;at by, wi&s;hing that <HI>it might end well,</HI> and their daughters critici&s;ing my air, my features, or my dre&s;s.</P>
<P>YOU know, Mr Rambler, that ambition is natural to youth, and curio&s;ity to under&s;tand|ing, and therefore, will hear, without wonder, that I was de&s;irous to extend my victories over tho&s;e, who might give more honour to the conqueror; and that I found in a country life a continual repetition of the &s;ame plea&s;ures, which was not &s;ufficient to fill up the mind for the pre&s;ent, or rai&s;e any expectations of the

<P>AT la&s;t the time came. My aunt, who&s;e hu&s;band has a &s;eat in parliament, and a place at court, buried her only child, and &s;ent for me to &s;upply the lo&s;s. The hope that I &s;hould &s;o far in&s;inuate my&s;elf into their favour, as to obtain a con&s;iderable augmentation of my for|tune, procured me every convenience for my departure, with great expedition; and I could not amid&s;t all my tran&s;ports forbear &s;ome in|dignation to &s;ee with what readine&s;s the na|tural guardians of my virtue &s;old me to a &s;tate, which they thought more hazardous than it really was, as &s;oon as a new acce&s;&s;ion of fortune glittered in their eyes.</P>
<P>THREE days I was upon the road, and on the fourth morning my heart danced at the &s;ight of London. I was &s;et down at my aunt's, and entered upon the &s;cene of action. I expected now, from the age and experience of my aunt, &s;ome le&s;&s;ons of prudential con|duct;

but, after the fir&s;t civilties and fir&s;t tears were over, was told what pity it was to have kept &s;o fine a girl &s;o long in the country; for that people who did not begin young &s;eldom dealt their cards hand&s;omely, or played them tolerably.</P>
<P>YOUNG per&s;ons are commonly inclined to &s;light the remarks and coun&s;els of their elders. I &s;miled, perhaps, with too much contempt, and was upon the point of telling her, that my time had not been pa&s;t in &s;uch trivial attain|ments. But I &s;oon found that things are to be e&s;timated, not by the importance of their effects, but the frequency of their u&s;e.</P>
<P>A FEW days after, my aunt gave me notice, that &s;ome company, which &s;he had been &s;ix weeks in collecting, was to meet that evening, and &s;he expected a finer a&s;&s;embly than had been &s;een all the winter. She expre&s;&s;ed this in the jargon of a game&s;ter, and, when I a&s;ked an explication of her terms of art, wondered where I had lived. I had already found my aunt &s;o incapable of any rational conclu&s;ion, and &s;o ignorant of every thing, whether great or little, that I had lo&s;t all regard to her opinion,

and dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with great expectations of an opportunity to di&s;play my charms among rivals, who&s;e competition would not di&s;|honour me.

The cards were broke open, the parties were formed, the whole night pa&s;&s;ed in a game, upon which the young and old were equally employed; nor was I able to attract an eye, or gain an ear, but being compelled to play without &s;kill, I perpetually embarra&s;&s;ed my partner, and &s;oon perceived the contempt of the whole table ga|thering upon me.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but &s;u&s;pect, Sir, that this odious fa&s;hion is produced by a con&s;piracy of the old, the ugly, and the ignorant, again&s;t the young and beautiful, the witty and the gay, as a con|trivance to level all di&s;tinctions of nature and of art, to confound the world in a chaos of folly, to take from tho&s;e, who could out&s;hine them, all the advantages of mind and body, to withold youth from its natural plea&s;ures, deprive wit of its influence, and beauty of its charms, to fix tho&s;e hearts upon money, to

I AM now, Mr Rambler, known to be an author, and am condemned, irrever&s;i|bly condemned, to all the mi&s;eries of high reputation. The fir&s;t morning after pub|lication my friends a&s;&s;embled about me; I pre&s;ented each, as is u&s;ual, with a copy of my book. They looked into the fir&s;t pa|ges, but were hindered, by their admiration, from reading farther. The fir&s;t pages are, in|deed, very elaborate. Some pa&s;&s;ages they particularly dwelt upon, as more eminently beautiful than the re&s;t; and &s;ome more deli|cate &s;trokes, and &s;ecret elegancies, I pointed out to them, which had e&s;caped their ob&s;erva|tion.

After dinner, the book was re&s;umed; but their prai|&s;es very often &s;o much overpowered my mo|de&s;ty, that I was forced to put about the gla&s;s, and had often no means of repre&s;&s;ing the cla|mours of their admiration, but by thundering to the drawer for another bottle.</P>

<P>THE whole week was thus &s;pent in a kind of literary revel, and I have now found that nothing is &s;o expen&s;ive as great abilities, unle&s;s there is join'd with them an in&s;atiable eager|ne&s;s of prai&s;e; for to e&s;cape from the pain of hearing my&s;elf exalted above the greate&s;t names dead and living of the learned world, it has
<PB N="141" REF="142">
already co&s;t me two hog&s;heads of port, fifteen gallons of arrack, ten dozen of claret, and five and forty bottles of champagne.</P>
<P>I WAS re&s;olved to &s;tay at home no longer, and, therefore, ro&s;e early and went to the coffee|hou&s;e; but found that I had now made my|&s;elf too eminent for happine&s;s, and that I was no longer to enjoy the plea&s;ure of mixing, upon equal terms, with the re&s;t of the world. As &s;oon as I enter the room, I &s;ee part of the company raging with envy, which they endea|vour to conceal, &s;ometimes with the appear|ance of laughter, and &s;ometimes with that of contempt; but the di&s;gui&s;e is &s;uch, that I can di&s;cover the &s;ecret rancour of their hearts, and as envy is de&s;ervedly its own puni&s;hment, I frequently indulge my&s;elf in tormenting them with my pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>BUT though there may be &s;ome &s;light &s;ati&s;|faction received from the mortification of my enemies, yet my benevolence will not &s;uffer me to take any plea&s;ure in the terrors of my friends. I have been cautious, &s;ince the ap|pearance of my work, not to give my&s;elf more premeditated airs of &s;uperiority, than the mo&s;t rigid humility might allow. It is, indeed,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
not impo&s;&s;ible that I may &s;ometimes have laid down my opinion, in a manner that &s;hewed a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my ability to maintain it, or interrupted the conver&s;ation, when I &s;aw its tendency, without &s;uffering the &s;peaker to wa&s;te his time in explaining his &s;entiments; and, indeed, I did indulge my&s;elf for two days in a cu&s;tom of drumming with my fingers, when the company began to lo&s;e them&s;elves in ab&s;urdities, or to encroach upon &s;ubjects which I knew them unqualified to di&s;cu&s;s. But I generally acted with great appearance of re&s;pect, even to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tupidity I pitied in my heart. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this ex|emplary moderation, &s;o univer&s;al is the dread of uncommon powers, and &s;uch the unwil|lingne&s;s of mankind to be made wi&s;er, that I have now for &s;ome days found my&s;elf &s;hun|ned by all my acquaintance. If I knock at a door, no body is at home; if I enter a coffee|hou&s;e, I have the box to my&s;elf. I live in the town like a lion in his de&s;art, or an eagle on his rock, too great for friend&s;hip or &s;ociety, and condemned to &s;olitude, by unhappy eleva|tion, and dreaded a&s;cendency.</P>
<P>NOR is my character only formidable to others, but burden&s;ome to my&s;elf. I natural|ly
<PB N="143" REF="144">
love to talk without much thinking, to &s;catter my merriment at random, and to relax my thoughts with ludicrous remarks and fan|ciful images; but &s;uch is now the importance of my opinion, that I am afraid to offer it, le&s;t, by being e&s;tabli&s;hed too ha&s;tily into a maxim, it &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of error to half the nation; and &s;uch is the expectation with which I am attended, when I am going to &s;peak, that I frequently pau&s;e to reflect whether what I am about to utter is worthy of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS, Sir, is &s;ufficiently mi&s;erable, but there are &s;till greater calamities behind. You mu&s;t have read how men of parts have had their clo&s;ets rifled, and their cabinets broke open at the in&s;tigation of piratical book&s;ellers, for the pro|fit of their works; and it is apparent, that there are many prints now &s;old in the &s;hops, of men whom you cannot &s;u&s;pect of &s;itting for that purpo&s;e, and who&s;e likene&s;&s;es mu&s;t have been certainly &s;tolen when their names made their faces vendible. The&s;e con&s;iderations at fir&s;t put me on my guard, and I have, indeed, found &s;ufficient rea&s;on for my caution, for I have di&s;covered many people examining my counte|nance, with a curio&s;ity that &s;hewed their in|tention
<PB N="144" REF="145">
to draw it; I immediately left the hou&s;e, but find the &s;ame behaviour in another.</P>
<P>OTHERS may be per&s;ecuted, but I am hunted; I have good rea&s;on to believe that eleven painters are now dogging me, for they know that he who can get my face fir&s;t will make his fortune. I often change my wig, and wear my hat over my eyes, by which I hope &s;omewhat to confound them; for you know it is not fair to &s;ell my face, without ad|mitting me to &s;hare the profit.</P>
<P>I AM, however, not &s;o much in pain for my face as for my papers, which I dare neither carry with me nor leave behind. I have, in|deed, taken &s;ome mea&s;ures for their pre&s;erva|tion, having put them in an iron che&s;t, and fixed a padlock upon my clo&s;et. I change my lodgings five times a week, and always remove at the dead of night.</P>
<P>THUS I live, in con&s;equence of having given too great proofs of a predominant genius, in the &s;olitude of a hermit, with the anxiety of a mi&s;er, and the caution of an outlaw; afraid to &s;hew my face, le&s;t it &s;hould be copied; afraid to &s;peak, le&s;t I &s;hould injure my cha|racter,
<PB N="145" REF="146">
and to write le&s;t my corre&s;pondents &s;hould publi&s;h my letters; always unea&s;y le&s;t my &s;ervants &s;hould &s;teal my papers for the &s;ake of money, or my friends for that of the publick. This it is to &s;oar above the re&s;t of mankind; and this repre&s;entation I lay before you, that I may be informed how to dive&s;t my&s;elf of the laurels which are &s;o cumber|&s;ome to the wearer, and de&s;cend to the enjoy|ment of that quiet from which I find a writer of the fir&s;t cla&s;s &s;o fatally debarred.</P>

<P>IT is recorded of &s;ome ea&s;tern monarch, that he kept an officer in his hou&s;e, who&s;e employment it was to remind him of his mor|tality, by calling out every morning, at a &s;tated hour; <HI>Remember, prince, that thou &s;halt die.</HI> And the contemplation of the frailne&s;s and uncertainty of our pre&s;ent &s;tate appeared of &s;o much importance to Solon of Athens, that he left this precept to future ages; <HI>Keep thine eye fixed upon the end of life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
A FREQUENT and attentive pro&s;pect of that hour, which mu&s;t put a period to all our &s;chemes, and deprive us of all our acqui&s;itions, is, indeed, of the utmo&s;t efficacy to the ju&s;t and rational di&s;po&s;ition of our affairs, and the wi&s;e and happy regulation of our lives; nor would ever any thing wicked, or often any thing ab&s;urd, be undertaken or pro&s;ecuted by him who &s;hould begin every day with a &s;erious reflection, that he is born to die.</P>
<P>THE di&s;turbers of our happine&s;s, in this world, are our de&s;ires, our griefs, and our fears, and to all the&s;e, the frequent con&s;ideration of death is a certain and adequate remedy. Think, &s;ays Epictetus, frequently on poverty, bani&s;hment, and death, and thou wilt then never indulge any violent de&s;ire, or give up thy heart to any mean &s;entiment, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>THAT the maxim of Epictetus is founded on ju&s;t ob&s;ervation will ea&s;ily be granted, when we reflect, how that vehemence of eagerne&s;s after the common objects of per&s;uit is kindled in our minds. We repre&s;ent to
<PB N="147" REF="148">
our&s;elves the plea&s;ures of &s;ome future po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffer our thoughts to dwell atten|tively upon it, till it has wholly ingro&s;&s;ed the imagination, and permits us not to conceive any other happine&s;s than its attainment, or any other mi&s;ery than its lo&s;s; every other &s;atisfaction which the bounty of providence has &s;cattered over life is neglected as incon&s;i|derable, in compari&s;on of the great object which we have placed before us, thrown from us as incumbering our activity, or trampled under foot as &s;tanding in our way.</P>
<P>EVERY man has experienced, how much of this ardour has remitted, when a &s;harp or tedious &s;ickne&s;s has &s;et death before his eyes. The exten&s;ive influence of greatne&s;s, the glitter of wealth, the prai&s;es of admirers, and the attendance of &s;upplicants, have appeared vain and empty things, when the la&s;t hour has &s;eemed to be approaching; and the &s;ame ap|pearance they would always have, if the &s;ame thought was always predominant. We &s;hould then find the ab&s;urdity of &s;tretching out our arms ince&s;&s;antly to gra&s;p that which we cannot keep, and wearing out our lives in endeavours to add new turrets to the fabrick of ambition, when the foundation it&s;elf is &s;haking, and
<PB N="148" REF="149">
the ground on which it &s;tands is mouldering away.</P>
<P>ALL envy is proportionate to de&s;ire; we are unea&s;y at the attainments of another, ac|cording as we think our own happine&s;s would be advanced by the addition of that which he witholds from us; and, therefore whatever depre&s;&s;es immoderate wi&s;hes, will, at the &s;ame time, &s;et the heart free from the corro&s;ion of envy, and exempt us from that vice, which is, above mo&s;t others, torment|ing to our&s;elves, hateful to the world, and productive of mean artifices, and &s;ordid pro|jects. He that con&s;iders how &s;oon he mu&s;t clo&s;e his life, will find nothing of &s;o much im|portance as to clo&s;e it well; and will, there|fore, look with indifference upon whatever is u&s;ele&s;s to that purpo&s;e. Whoever reflects fre|quently upon the uncertainty of his own du|ration, will ea&s;ily find out, that the &s;tate of others is not more permanent, and that what can confer nothing on him&s;elf very de&s;irable, cannot &s;o much improve the condition of a rival, as to make him, in any great degree, &s;uperior to tho&s;e from whom he has carried the prize, a prize too mean to excite a very ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
EVEN grief, that pa&s;&s;ion, to which the virtuous and tender mind is more particularly &s;ubject, will be obviated, or alleviated, by the &s;ame reflection. It will be obviated, if all the ble&s;&s;ings of our condition are enjoyed with a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the uncertain tenure by which they are held: If we remember, that whatever we po&s;&s;e&s;s is to be in our hands but a very little time, and that the little, which our mo&s;t lively hopes can promi&s;e us, may be made le&s;s, by ten thou&s;and accidents, we &s;hall not much repine at a lo&s;s, of which we cannot e&s;timate the value, but of which, though we cannot tell the lea&s;t amount, we know, with &s;ufficient certainty, the greate&s;t, and are convinced that the greate&s;t is not much to be regretted.</P>
<P>BUT, if any pa&s;&s;ion has &s;o much u&s;urped our under&s;tanding, as not to &s;uffer us to en|joy our advantages with the moderation pre|&s;cribed by rea&s;on and by virtue, it is not too late to apply this remedy, when we find our&s;elves &s;inking under &s;orrow, and inclined to pine for that which is irrecoverably vani&s;hed. We may then u&s;efully revolve the uncertainty of our own condition, and the folly of la|menting
<PB N="150" REF="151">
that from which, if it had &s;tayed little longer, we &s;hould our&s;elves have been taken away.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the &s;harpe&s;t and mo&s;t melting &s;orrow, that which ari&s;es from the lo&s;s of tho&s;e whom we have loved with tenderne&s;s, it may be ob&s;erved, that friend&s;hip between mortals can be contracted on no other terms, than that one mu&s;t &s;ometime mourn for the other's death: And this grief will always yield to the &s;urviver one con&s;olation proporti|onate to his affliction; for the pain, whatever it be, that he him&s;elf feels, his friend has e&s;caped.</P>
<P>NOR is fear, the mo&s;t overbearing and re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s of all our pa&s;&s;ions, le&s;s to be temperated by this univer&s;al medicine of the mind. The frequent contemplation of death, as it &s;hows the vanity of all human good, di&s;covers like|wi&s;e the lightne&s;s of all terre&s;trial evil, which, certainly, can la&s;t no longer than the &s;ubject upon which it acts, and, according to the old ob&s;ervation, mu&s;t be &s;horter, as it is more vi|olent. The mo&s;t cruel calamity, which mi&s;|fortune can produce, mu&s;t, by the nece&s;&s;ity of nature, be quickly at an end. The &s;oul cannot
<PB N="151" REF="152">
long be held in pri&s;on, but will fly away, and leave a lifele&s;s body to human malice. <Q>&mdash;Ridetque &s;ui ludibria trunci.</Q></P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t that we can threaten to one ano|ther is that death, which, indeed, we may precipitate, but cannot retard, and from which, therefore, it cannot become a wi&s;e man to buy a reprieve at the expence of his virtue, &s;ince he knows not how &s;mall a porti|on of time he can purcha&s;e, which, whether &s;hort or long, will be made le&s;s valuable by the remembrance of the price by which it has been obtained. He is &s;ure that he de&s;troys his happine&s;s, but is not &s;ure that he lengthens his life.</P>
<P>THE known &s;hortne&s;s of life, as it ought to moderate our pa&s;&s;ions, may likewi&s;e, with equal propriety, contract our de&s;igns. There is not time for the mo&s;t forcible genius, and mo&s;t active indu&s;try, to extend its effects beyond a certain &s;phere. To project the con|que&s;t of the world, is the madne&s;s of &s;ome mighty princes; to hope for excellence in every &s;cience, has been the folly of &s;ome men of uncommon genius; and both have found, at la&s;t, that they have panted for a height of
<PB N="152" REF="153">
eminence denied to humanity, and have lo&s;t many opportunities of making them&s;elves u&s;e|ful and happy, by a vain ambition of obtaining a &s;pecies of honour, which the eternal laws of providence have placed beyond the reach of man.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;carriages of the great de&s;igns of princes are recorded in the hi&s;tories of the world, but when they are read, are of little u&s;e to the bulk of mankind, who &s;eem very little intere&s;ted in admonitions again&s;t errors which they cannot commit. But the fate of literary ambition is a proper &s;ubject for every &s;cholar to con&s;ider; for who has not had occa|&s;ion to regret the di&s;&s;ipation of great abilities in a boundle&s;s multiplicity of per&s;uits, to la|ment the &s;udden de&s;ertion of many excellent de&s;igns, upon the offer of &s;ome other &s;ubject, made more inviting by its novelty, and to ob|&s;erve the inaccuracy and deficiencies of works left unfini&s;hed by too great an extention of the plan?</P>
<P>IT is always plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve, how much more our minds can conceive, than our bodies can perform; yet it is our duty, while we continue in this complicated &s;tato, to regulato
<PB N="153" REF="154">
one part of our compo&s;ition by &s;ome regard to the other. We are not to indulge our cor|poreal appetites with plea&s;ures that impair our intellectual vigour, nor gratify our minds with &s;chemes which we know our lives mu&s;t fail in attempting to execute. The uncertainty of our duration ought at once to &s;et bounds to our de&s;igns, and add incitements to our indu&s;try; and when we find our&s;elves inclined either to immen&s;ity in our &s;chemes, or &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s in our endeavours, we may either check, or ani|mate, our&s;elves, by recollecting, with the fa|ther of phy&s;ic, <HI>that art is long, and life is &s;hort.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is no ob&s;ervation more frequently made by &s;uch as employ them&s;elves in &s;urveying the conduct of mankind, than
<PB N="154" REF="155">
that marriage, though the dictate of nature, and the in&s;titution of providence, is yet very often the cau&s;e of mi&s;ery, and that tho&s;e who enter into that &s;tate can &s;eldom forbear to expre&s;s their repentance of the folly, and their envy of tho&s;e whom either chance or caution has witheld from it.</P>
<P>THIS general unhappine&s;s has given occa&s;i|on to many &s;age maxims among the &s;erious, and &s;mart remarks among the gay; the mo|rali&s;t and the writer of epigrams have equal|ly &s;hown their abilities upon it; &s;ome have la|mented, and &s;ome have ridiculed it; but as the faculty of writing has been chiefly a ma&s;culine endowment, the reproach of making the world mi&s;erable has been always thrown upon the women, and the grave and the merry have equally thought them&s;elves at liberty to conclude either with declamatory complaints, or &s;atirical cen&s;ures of female fol|ly or ficklene&s;s, ambition or cruelty, extrava|gance or lu&s;t.</P>
<P>LED by &s;uch a number of examples, and incited by my &s;hare in the common intere&s;t, &s;ometimes venture to con&s;ider this univer&s;al grievance, having endeavoured to dive&s;t my
<PB N="155" REF="156">
heart of all partiality, and place my&s;elf as a kind of neutral being between the &s;exes, who&s;e clamours, if we attend only to the world pa&s;&s;ing before us, being equally loud, and vented on both &s;ides with all the vehe|mence of di&s;tre&s;s, all the apparent confidence of ju&s;tice, and all the indignation of injured virtue, &s;eem therefore entitled to equal regard. The men have, indeed, by their &s;uperiority of writing, been able to collect the evidence of many ages, and rai&s;e prejudices in their favour by the venerable te&s;timonies of philo&s;ophers, hi&s;torians and poets. But the pleas of the la|dies appeal to pa&s;&s;ions of more forcible opera|tion than the reverence of antiquity; if they have not &s;o great names on their &s;ide, they have &s;tronger arguments; it is to little pur|po&s;e that Socrates, or Euripides, are produced again&s;t the &s;ighs of &s;oftne&s;s, and the tears of beauty. The mo&s;t frigid and inexorable judge would, at lea&s;t, &s;tand &s;u&s;pended between equal powers, as Lucan was perplexed in the deter|mination of the cau&s;e, where the deities were on one &s;ide, and Cato on the other.</P>
<P>BUT I, who have long &s;tudied the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;tracted philo&s;ophy, have now, in the cool maturity of life, arrived to &s;uch com|mand
<PB N="156" REF="157">
over my pa&s;&s;ions, that I can hear the vo|ciferations of either &s;ex without catching any of the fire from tho&s;e that utter them. For I have found, by long experience, that a man will &s;ometimes rage at his wife, when in reali|ty his mi&s;tre&s;s has offended him; and a lady complain of the cruelty of her hu&s;band, when &s;he has no other enemy than bad cards. I do not &s;uffer my&s;elf now to be any longer impo&s;ed upon by oaths on one &s;ide, or fits on the other; nor when the hu&s;band ha&s;tens to the tavern, and the lady retires to her clo&s;et, am I always confident that they are driven to to it by their mi&s;eries; &s;ince I have &s;ometimes rea&s;on to be|lieve, that they purpo&s;e not &s;o much to &s;ooth their &s;orrows, as to animate their fury. But how little credit &s;oever may be given to parti|cular accu&s;ations, the general accumulation of the charge &s;hews, with too much evidence, that married per&s;ons are not very often advan|ced in felicity; and, therefore, it may be pro|per to examine at what avenues &s;o many evils have made their way into the world. With this purpo&s;e, I have reviewed the lives of my friends, who have been lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in con|nubial contracts, and attentively con&s;idered by what motives they were incited to marry, and by what principles they regulated their choice.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
ONE of the fir&s;t of my acquaintances that re&s;olved to quit the un&s;ettled thoughtle&s;s con|dition of a batchelor was Prudentius, a man of &s;low parts, but not without knowledge or judgment in things which he had lei&s;ure to con&s;ider gradually before he determined them. Whenever we met at a tavern, it was his pro|vince to &s;ettle the &s;cheme of our entertain|ment, contract with the cook, and inform us when we had called for wine to the &s;um origi|nally propo&s;ed. This grave con&s;iderer found by deep meditation that a man was no lo&s;er by marrying early, even though he contented him&s;elf with a le&s;s fortune; for e&s;timating the exact worth of annuities, he found that, con|&s;idering the con&s;tant diminution of the value of life, with the probable fall of the intere&s;t of money, it was not wor&s;e to have ten thou&s;and pounds at the age of two and twenty years, than a much larger fortune at thirty; for ma|ny opportunities, &s;ays he, occur of improving money, which if a man mi&s;&s;es, he may not afterwards recover.</P>
<P>FULL of the&s;e reflections he threw his eyes about him, not in &s;earch of beauty, or elegance, or dignity, or under&s;tanding, but of a woman
<PB N="158" REF="159">
with ten thou&s;and pounds. Such a woman, in a wealthy part of the kingdom, it was not very difficult to find; and by artful manage|ment with her father, who&s;e ambition was to make his daughter a gentlewoman, my friend got her, as he boa&s;ted to us in confi|dence two days after his marriage, for a &s;et|tlement of &s;eventy three pounds a year le&s;s than her fortune might have claimed, and le&s;s than he would him&s;elf have given, if the fools had been but wi&s;e enough to delay the bargain.</P>
<P>THUS, at once delighted with the &s;uperiori|ty of his parts, and the augmentation of his fortune, he carried Furia to his own hou&s;e, in which he never afterwards enjoyed one hour of happine&s;s. For Furia was a wretch of mean intellects, violent pa&s;&s;ions, a &s;trong voice, and low education, without any &s;en&s;e of happine&s;s but that which con&s;i&s;ted in eating, and counting money. Furia was a &s;cold. They agreed in the de&s;ire of wealth, but with this difference, that Prudentius was for grow|ing rich by gain, Furia by par&s;imony. Pru|dentius would venture his money with chan|ces very much in his favour; but Furia very wi&s;ely ob&s;erving that what they had was, while they had it, <HI>their own,</HI> thought all tra&s;&s;ick
<PB N="159" REF="160">
too great a hazard, and was for putting it out at low intere&s;t, upon good &s;ecurity. Pruden|tius ventured, however, to in&s;ure a &s;hip, at a very unrea&s;onable price, but happening to lo&s;e his money, was &s;o tormented with the clamours of his wife, that he never dur&s;t try a &s;econd experiment. He has now grovelled &s;even and forty years under Furia's direction, who has never mentioned him, &s;ince his bad luck, by any other name than that of <HI>the in&s;urer.</HI></P>
<P>THE next that married from our &s;ociety was Florentius. He happened to &s;ee Zephyretta in a chariot at a hor&s;e-race, danced with her at night, was confirmed in his fir&s;t ardour, waited on her next morning, and declared him&s;elf her lover. Florentius had not know|ledge enough of the world, to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the flutter of coquetry, and the &s;pright|line&s;s of wit, or between the &s;mile of allure|ment, and that of chearfulne&s;s. He was &s;oon waked from his rapture by conviction that his plea&s;ure was but the plea&s;ure of a day. Ze|phyretta had in four and twenty hours &s;pent her &s;tock of repartee, gone round the circle of her airs, and had nothing remaining for him but childi&s;h in&s;ipidity, or for her&s;elf, but the

practice of the &s;ame artifices upon new men; by which &s;he is every day bringing contempt upon them both.</P>
<P>MELISSUS was a man of parts, capable of enjoying, and of improving life. He had pa&s;&s;ed through the various &s;cenes of gayety with that indifference and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him|&s;elf, natural to men who have &s;omething high|er and nobler in their pro&s;pect. Retiring to &s;pend the &s;ummer in a village little frequented, he happened to lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Ianthe, and was unavoidably drawn to &s;ome acquaintance, which her wit and politene&s;s &s;oon invited him to improve. Having no opportu|nity of any other company, they were always together; and, as they owed their plea&s;ures to each other, they began to forget that any plea|&s;ure was enjoyed before their meeting. Me|li&s;&s;us from being delighted with her company, quickly began to be unea&s;y in her ab&s;ence, and being &s;ufficiently convinced of the force of her under&s;tanding, and finding, as he imagi|ned, &s;uch a conformity of temper as declared them formed for each other, he addre&s;&s;ed her as a lover, after no very long court&s;hip obtained her for his wife, and brought her next winter to town in triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
Now began their in&s;elicity. Meli&s;&s;us had only &s;een her in one &s;cene, where there was no variety of objects, to produce the proper ex|citements to contrary de&s;ires. They had both loved &s;olitude and reflection, where there was nothing but &s;olitude and reflection to be lov|ed, but when they came into publick life, Ianthe di&s;covered tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which accident rather than hypocri&s;y had hitherto concealed. She was, indeed, not without the power of thinking, for that he would have detected, but was wholly without the exertion of that power, when either gayety, or &s;plendour, played on her imagination. She was expen|&s;ive in her diver&s;ions, vehement in her pa&s;&s;i|ons, in&s;atiate of plea&s;ure however dangerous to her reputation, and eager of applau&s;e by whom&s;oever it might be given. This was the wife which Meli&s;&s;us the philo&s;opher found in his retirement, and from whom he expect|ed an a&s;&s;ociate in his &s;tudies, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his virtues.</P>
<P>PROSAPIUS, upon the death of his young|er brother, that the family might not be ex|tinct, married his hou&s;ekeeper, and has ever &s;ince been complaining to his friends that mean
<PB N="162" REF="163">
notions are in&s;tilled into his children, that he is a&s;hamed to &s;it at his own table, and that his hou&s;e is unea&s;y to him for want of &s;uitable companions.</P>
<P>AVARO, ma&s;ter of a very large e&s;tate, took a woman of bad reputation, recommended to him by a rich uncle, who made that mar|riage the condition on which he &s;hould be his heir. Avaro now wonders to perceive his own fortune, his wife's, and his uncle's, in|&s;ufficient to give him that happine&s;s which is to be found only with a woman of virtue.</P>
<P>I intend to treat in more papers on this im|portant article of life, to relate the rea&s;ons, which influenced not only others of my friends, but &s;ome ladies whom I have known, in the choice of an in&s;eparable companion, and give account of more cau&s;es which have di&s;ap|pointed the hope of lovers. I &s;hall, there|fore, make no reflexion upon the&s;e hi&s;tories, except that all whom I have mentioned fail|ed to obtain happine&s;s, for want of con&s;ider|ing that marriage is the &s;tricte&s;t tye of perpe|tual friend&s;hip; that there can be no friend|&s;hip without confidence, and no confidence without integrity; and that he mu&s;t expect
<PB N="163" REF="164">
to be wretched, who pays to beauty, riches, or politene&s;s, that regard which only virtue and piety can claim.</P>

<P>IT is never without very melancholy reflexi|ons, that we can ob&s;erve the mi&s;conduct, or mi&s;carriage, of tho&s;e men, who &s;eem, by the force of under&s;tanding, or extent of know|ledge, exempted from the general frailties of human nature, and privileged from the com|mon infelicities of life. Though the world is crowded with &s;cenes of calamity, we look, for the mo&s;t part, upon the general ma&s;s of wretchedne&s;s with very little regard, and fix our eyes upon the &s;tate of particular per&s;ons, whom the eminence of their qualities marks
<PB N="164" REF="165">
out from the multitude; as, in reading an account of a battle, we &s;eldom reflect on the vulgar heaps of &s;laughter, but follow the hero, with our whole attention, through all the va|rieties of his fortune, without a thought of the thou&s;ands that are falling round him.</P>
<P>WITH the &s;ame kind of anxious venera|tion I have for many years been making ob&s;er|vations on the life of Polyfilus, a man whom all his acquaintances have, from his fir&s;t ap|pearance in the world, feared for the quickne&s;s of his di&s;cernment, and admired for the multi|plicity of his attainments, but who&s;e progre&s;s in life, and u&s;efulne&s;s to mankind has, perhaps, been hindered by the &s;uperfluity of his know|ledge, and the celerity of his mind.</P>
<P>POLYPHILUS was remarkable, at the &s;chool, for &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all his companions, without any vi&s;ible application, and at the univer&s;ity was di&s;tingui&s;hed equally for his &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s as well through the rough and thorny mazes of &s;cience, as the &s;mooth and flowery path of po|liter literature, without any &s;trict confinement to hours of &s;tudy, or any remarkable forbear|ance of the common amu&s;ements of young men.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
WHEN Polyphilus was at the age, in which men u&s;ually chu&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, and prepare to enter into a public character, every acade|mical eye was fixed upon him; all were curi|ous to inquire, what this univer&s;al genius would fix upon for the employment of his life; and no doubt was made but that he would leave all his contemporaries behind him, and mount to the highe&s;t honours of that cla&s;s, in which he &s;hould inli&s;t him&s;elf, without tho&s;e delays and pau&s;es which mu&s;t be always endur|ed by meaner abilities.</P>
<P>POLYPHILUS, though by no means in&s;o|lent or a&s;&s;uming, had been &s;ufficiently encour|aged, by uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s, to place great confidence in his own parts; and was not be|low his companions in the indulgence of his hopes, and expectation of the a&s;toni&s;hment with which the world would be &s;truck, when fir&s;t his lu&s;tre &s;hould break out upon it; nor could he forbear (for whom does not con&s;tant flattery intoxicate?) to join &s;ometimes in the mirth of his friends, at the &s;udden di&s;appear|ance of tho&s;e, who, having &s;hone awhile, and drawn the eyes of the public upon their feeble radiance, were now doomed to fade away before him.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
IT is natural for a man to catch advantage|ous notions of the condition which tho&s;e, with whom he conver&s;es, are &s;triving to attain. Polyphilus, in a ramble to London, fell acci|dentally among the phy&s;icians, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of turning philo&s;ophy to profit, and &s;o highly delighted with a new theory of fevers which darted in|to his imagination, and which, after having con&s;idered it a few hours, he found him&s;elf able to maintain again&s;t all the advocates for the ancient &s;y&s;tem, that he re&s;olved to apply him&s;elf to anatomy, botany, and chemi&s;try, and to leave no part unconquered either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable king|doms.</P>
<P>HE therefore read authors, con&s;tructed &s;y&s;tems, and tried experiments; but unhap|pily, as he was going to &s;ee a new plant in flower at Chel&s;ea, he met, in cro&s;&s;ing We&s;t|min&s;ter to take water, the chancellor's coach; he had the curio&s;ity to follow him into the hall, where a remarkable cau&s;e happened to be tryed, and found him&s;elf able to produce &s;o many ar|guments, which the lawyers had omitted on both &s;ides, that he determined to quit phy&s;ic
<PB N="167" REF="168">
for a profe&s;&s;ion, in which he found it would be &s;o ea&s;y to excel, and which promi&s;ed high|er honours, and larger profits, without melan|choly attendance upon mi&s;ery, mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on to peevi&s;hne&s;s, and continual interruption of re&s;t and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>HE immediately took chambers in the Tem|ple, bought a common-place-book, and con|fined him&s;elf for &s;ome months to the peru&s;al of the &s;tatutes, year-books, pleadings, and re|ports; he was a con&s;tant hearer of the pro|ceedings in the courts, and began to put ca&s;es with rea&s;onable accuracy. But he &s;oon di&s;co|vered, by con&s;idering the fortune of lawyers, that preferment was not to be got by acutene&s;s, learning, and eloquence. He was perplexed by the ab&s;urdities of attorneys, and mi&s;repre|&s;entations made by his clients of their own cau&s;es, by the u&s;ele&s;s anxiety of one, and the ince&s;&s;ant importunity of another; he be|gan to repent of having devoted him&s;elf to a &s;tudy, which was &s;o narrow in its comprehen|&s;ion that it could never carry his name to any other country, and thought it unworthy of a man of parts to &s;ell his life only for money. The barrenne&s;s of his fellow-&s;tudents forced him generally into other company at his hours
<PB N="168" REF="169">
of entertainment, and among the varieties of conver&s;ation, through which his curio&s;ity was daily wandering, he, by chance, mingled at a tavern with &s;ome intelligent officers of the army. A man of letters was ea&s;ily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance, and &s;of|tened into kindne&s;s by the politene&s;s of their addre&s;s; he, therefore, cultivated this new ac|quaintance, and when he &s;aw how readily they found in every place admi&s;&s;ion and regard, and how familiarly they mingled with every rank and order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for military honours, and wondered how the prejudices of the univer&s;ity &s;hould make him &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible of that ambition, which has fired &s;o many hearts in every age, and negligent of that calling, which is, above all others, univer&s;ally and invariably illu&s;trious, and which gives, even to the exterior ap|pearance of its profe&s;&s;ors, a dignity and free|dom unknown to the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>THESE favourable impre&s;&s;ions were made &s;till deeper by his conver&s;ation with ladies, who&s;e regard for &s;oldiers he could not ob&s;erve, without wi&s;hing him&s;elf one of that happy fraternity, to which the female world &s;eemed to have devoted their charms and their kind|ne&s;s.
<PB N="169" REF="170">
The love of knowledge, which was &s;till his predominant inclination, was gratified by the recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign countries; and, therefore, he thought there was no way of life, in which all his views could &s;o compleatly concenter as in that of a &s;oldier. In the art of war he thought it not difficult to excel, having ob&s;erved his new friends not very much ver&s;ed in the principles of tacticks or fortification; and, therefore, he &s;tudied all the military writers both antient and modern, and, in a &s;hort time, could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been lo&s;t from the beginning of the world. He often &s;hewed at table how Alex|ander &s;hould have been checked in his con|que&s;ts, what was the fatal error at Phar&s;alia, how Charles of Sweden might have e&s;caped his ruin at Pultowa, and Marlborough might have been made to repent his temerity at Blen|heim. He entrenched armies upon paper &s;o that no &s;uperiority of numbers could force them, and modelled in clay many impregna|ble fortre&s;&s;es, on which all the pre&s;ent arts of attack would be exhau&s;ted without effect.</P>
<P>POLYPHILUS, in a &s;hort time, obtained a commi&s;&s;ion; but before he could rub off the
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;olemnity of a &s;cholar, and gain the true air of military vivacity, a war was declared, and forces &s;ent to the continent. Here Polyphilus unhappily found that &s;tudy alone would not make a &s;oldier; for being much accu&s;tomed to think, he let the &s;en&s;e of danger &s;ink into his mind, and felt at the approach of any action that terror which a &s;entence of death would have brought upon him. He &s;aw that, in&s;tead of conquering their fears, the endeavour of his gay friends was only to e&s;cape them; but his philo&s;ophy chained his mind to its object, and rather loaded him with &s;hackles than fur|ni&s;hed him with arms. He, however, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed his mi&s;ery in &s;ilence, and pa&s;&s;ed through the campaign with honour, but found him|&s;elf utterly unable to &s;upport another.</P>
<P>HE then had recour&s;e again to his books, and continued to range from one &s;tudy to ano|ther. As I u&s;ually vi&s;it him once a month, and am admitted to him without previous notice, I have found him, within this la&s;t half year, decyphering the Chine&s;e language, mak|ing a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the ob&s;olete terms of the Engli&s;h law, writing an inquiry concerning the ancient Corinthian
<PB N="171" REF="172">
bra&s;s, and forming a new &s;cheme of the vari|ations of the needle.</P>
<P>THUS is this powerful genius, which might have extended the &s;phere of any &s;cience|or benefited the world in any profe&s;&s;ion, di&s;&s;i|pated in a boundle&s;s variety, without any pro|fit to others or him&s;elf. He makes &s;udden irruptions into the regions of knowledge, and &s;ees all ob&s;tacles give way before him; but he never &s;tays long enough to compleat his conque&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h laws, or bring away the &s;poils.</P>
<P>SUCH is often the folly of tho&s;e men, whom nature has enabled to obtain &s;kill and know|ledge, on terms &s;o ea&s;y, that they have no &s;en&s;e of the value of the acqui&s;ition; who are qualified to make &s;uch &s;peedy progre&s;s in learn|ing, that they think them&s;elves at liberty to loiter in the way, and often, by turning a&s;ide after every new object, like Atalanta, lo&s;e the race to &s;lower competitors, who pre&s;s diligent|ly forward, and who&s;e force is directed to a &s;ingle point.</P>
<P>I HAVE often thought tho&s;e happy that have been fixed, from the fir&s;t dawn of
<PB N="172" REF="173">
thought, in a determination to &s;ome &s;tate of life, by the choice of one, who&s;e authority may preclude caprice, and who&s;e influence may prejudice them in favour of his opinion. The general precept of con&s;ulting the genius is of little u&s;e, unle&s;s we are told, how the genius can be known. If it is to be di&s;co|vered only by experiment, life will be lo&s;t, before the re&s;olution can be fixed; if any other indications are to be found, they may, perhaps, be very early di&s;cerned. At lea&s;t, if to mi&s;carry in an attempt, be a proof of having mi&s;taken the direction of the genius, men appear not le&s;s frequently deceived with regard to them&s;elves than to others; and, therefore, no one has much rea&s;on to complain that his life was planned out by his friends, or to be confident that he &s;hould have had either more honour, or happine&s;s, by being abandoned to the chance of his own fancy.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid of the learned bi&s;hop Sander|&s;on, that, when he was preparing his lectures, he he&s;itated &s;o much, and rejected &s;o often, that, at the time of reading, he was often forced to produce, not what was be&s;t, but what happened to be at hand. This will be the &s;tate of every man, who, in the choice
<PB N="173" REF="174">
of his employment, balances all the argu|ments on every &s;ide; the complication is &s;o intricate, the motives and objections &s;o numer|ous, there is &s;o much play for the imagination, and &s;o much remains in the power of others, that rea&s;on is forced at la&s;t to re&s;t in neutrality, the deci&s;ion devolves into the hands of chance, and after a great part of life &s;pent in inquiries which can never be re&s;olved, the re&s;t mu&s;t of|ten pa&s;s in repenting the unnece&s;&s;ary delay, and can be u&s;eful to few other purpo&s;es than to warn others, again&s;t the &s;ame folly, and to &s;how, that of two &s;tates of life equally con|&s;i&s;tent with religion and virtue, he who chu|&s;es earlie&s;t chu&s;es be&s;t.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the numerous &s;tratagems, by which pride endeavours to recommend folly to regard, there is &s;carcely one that meets with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than affectation, or a per|petual di&s;gui&s;e of the real character, by ficti|tious appearances: whether it be, that every
<PB N="174" REF="175">
man hates fal&s;hood, from the natural con|gruity of truth to his faculties of rea&s;on, or that every man is jealous of the honour of his under&s;tanding, and thinks his di&s;cernment con|&s;equentially called in que&s;tion, whenever any thing is exhibited under a borrowed form.</P>
<P>THIS aver&s;ion from all kinds of di&s;gui&s;e, whatever be its cau&s;e, is univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, and ince&s;&s;antly in action; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, that, to exa&s;perate dete&s;tation, or excite con|tempt, any intere&s;t &s;hould be invaded, or any competition attempted; it is &s;ufficient, that there is an intention to deceive, an intention which every heart &s;wells to oppo&s;e, and every tongue is bu&s;y to detect.</P>
<P>THIS reflexion was awakened in my mind by a very common practice among my corre|&s;pondents, of writing under characters which they cannot &s;upport, which are of no u&s;e to the explanation of that which they de&s;cribe, or the enforcement of that which they recom|mend; and which, therefore, &s;ince they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume them only for the &s;ake of di&s;playing their abilities, I will advi&s;e them for the future to forbear as laborious without advantage,</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">
IT is almo&s;t a general ambition of tho&s;e, who favour me with their advice for the regu|lation of my conduct, or their contribution for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my under&s;tanding, to affect the &s;tyle and the names of ladies. And I cannot always withold &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of anger, like Hugh in the comedy, when I happen to find that a woman has a beard. I mu&s;t, therefore, warn the gentle Phyllis, that &s;he &s;end me no more letters from the Hor&s;e-Guards; and require of Belinda, that &s;he be content to re&s;ign her pretention to female e|legance, till &s;he has lived three weeks with|out hearing the politicks of Bat&s;on's coffee-hou&s;e. I mu&s;t indulge my&s;elf in the liberty of ob&s;erving, that there were &s;ome allu&s;ions in Chloris's production, &s;ufficient to &s;hew that Bracton and Plowden are her favourite authors; and that Euphelia has not been long enough at home, to wear out all the traces of the phra&s;e|ology which &s;he learned in the expedition to Carthagena.</P>
<P>AMONG all my female friends, there was none who gave me more trouble to decypher her true character, than Penthe&s;ilea, who&s;e letter lay upon my de&s;k three days, before I
<PB N="176" REF="177">
could fix upon the real writer. There was a confu&s;ion of images, and medley of barbarity, which held me long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; till by per|&s;everance, I di&s;entangled the perplexity, and found, that Penthe&s;ilea is the &s;on of a wealthy &s;tock-jobber, who &s;pends his morning under his father's eye, in 'Change-Alley, dines at a tavern in Covent-Garden, pa&s;&s;es his evening in the playhou&s;e, and part of the night at a gaming-table, and having learned the dialect of the&s;e various regions, has mingled them all in a &s;tudied compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>WHEN Lee was once told by a critic, that it was very ea&s;y to write like a madman, he an&s;wered, that it was difficult to write like a madman, but ea&s;y enough to write like a fool; and, I hope to be excu&s;ed by my kind contributors, if, in imitation of this great author, I pre&s;ume to remind them, that it is much ea&s;ier not to write like a man, than to write like a woman.</P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, &s;ome ingenious well-wi&s;h|ers, who, without departing from their &s;ex, have found very wonderful di&s;tinctions. A very &s;mart letter has been &s;ent me from a puny en&s;ign, &s;igned Ajax Telamonius; another,
<PB N="177" REF="178">
in recommendation of a new treati&s;e upon cards, from a game&s;ter, who calls him&s;elf Se&s;o&s;tris; and another upon the improvements of the fi&s;hery, from Diocle&s;ian: but as the&s;e &s;eem only to have picked up their appellations by chance, without endeavouring at any par|ticular impo&s;ture, their improprieties are rather in&s;tances of blunder, than of affectation, and are, therefore, not equally fitted to inflame the ho&s;tile pa&s;&s;ions; for it is not folly but pride, not error but deceit, which the world means to per&s;ecute, when it rai&s;es the full cry of nature to hunt down affectation.</P>
<P>THE hatred, which di&s;&s;imulation always draws upon it&s;elf, is &s;o great, that if I did not know how much cunning differs from wi&s;dom, I &s;hould wonder that any men have &s;o little knowledge of their own intere&s;t, as to a&s;pire to wear a ma&s;k for life; to try to impo&s;e upon the world a character, to which they feel them|&s;elves void of any ju&s;t claim; and to hazard their quiet, their fame, and even their profit, by expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the danger of that reproach, malevolence, and neglect, which &s;uch a di&s;covery as they have always to fear will certainly bring upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
IT might be imagined, that the plea&s;ure of reputation &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in the &s;atisfaction of having our opinion of our own merit confirmed by the &s;uffrage of the publick; and that, to be extolled for a quality, which a man knows him&s;elf to want, &s;hould give him no other happine&s;s than to be mi&s;taken for the owner of an e&s;tate, over which he chances to be travel|ling. But he, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon affectation, knows nothing of this delicacy; like a de&s;pe|rate adventurer in commerce, he takes up re|putation upon tru&s;t, mortgages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which he never had, and enjoys, to the fatal hour of bankrupcy, though with a thou&s;and terrors and anxieties, the unnece&s;&s;ary &s;plendour of borrowed riches.</P>
<P>AFFECTATION is to be always di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from hypocri&s;y, as being the art of coun|terfeiting tho&s;e qualities, which we might, with innocence and &s;afety, be known to want. Thus the man, who, to carry on any fraud, or to conceal any crime, pretends to rigours of devotion, and exactne&s;s of life, is guilty of hypocri&s;y; and his guilt is greater, as the end, for which he puts on the fal&s;e appearance, is more pernicious. But he that, with an
<PB N="179" REF="180">
awkward addre&s;s, and unplea&s;ing countenance, boa&s;ts of the conque&s;ts made by him among the ladies, and counts over the thou&s;ands which he might have pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed if he would have &s;ub|mitted to the yoke of matrimony, is charge|able only with affectation. Hypocri&s;y is the nece&s;&s;ary burthen of villainy, affectation part of the cho&s;en trappings of folly; the one completes a villain, the other only fini&s;hes a fop. Contempt is the proper puni&s;hment of affectation, and dete&s;tation the ju&s;t con&s;equence of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>WITH the hypocrite it is not at pre&s;ent my intention to expo&s;tulate, though even he might be taught the excellency of virtue, by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeming to be virtuous; but the man of affectation may, perhaps, be re|claimed, by finding how little he is likely to gain by perpetual con&s;traint, and ince&s;&s;ant vigilance, and how much more &s;ecurely he might make his way to e&s;teem, by cultivating real, than di&s;playing counterfeit qualities.</P>

to the encouragement of affectation. For, if the pinacles of fame be, at be&s;t, &s;lippery, how un&s;teady mu&s;t his footing be who &s;tands upon pinacles without foundation! If prai&s;e be made, by the incon&s;tancy and malice of tho&s;e who mu&s;t confer it, a ble&s;&s;ing which no man can promi&s;e him&s;elf from the mo&s;t con&s;picuous merit, and vigorous indu&s;try, how faint mu&s;t be the hope of gaining it, when the uncertainty is multiplied by the weakne&s;s of the preten&s;ions! He that per&s;ues fame with ju&s;t claims, tru&s;ts his happine&s;s to the winds; but he that endeavours after it, by fal&s;e merit, has to fear, not only the violence of the &s;torm, but the leaks of his ve&s;&s;el. Though he &s;hould happen to keep above water for a time, by the help of a &s;oft breeze, and a calm &s;ea, at the fir&s;t gu&s;t he mu&s;t inevitably founder, with this melancholy reflexion, that, if he would have been con|tent with his natural &s;tation, he might have e&s;caped his calamity. Affectation my po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed for a time, and a man may, by great attention, per&s;uade others, that he really has the qualities, which he pre&s;umes to boa&s;t; but the hour will come when he &s;hould exert them, and then whatever he enjoyed in prai&s;e, he mu&s;t &s;uffer in reproach.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">
APPLAUSE and admiration are by no means to be counted among the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and therefore any indirect arts to obtain them have very little claim to pardon or compa&s;&s;ion. There is &s;carcely any man without &s;ome valuable or improvable qualities, by which he might always &s;ecure him&s;elf from contempt. And perhaps exemption from ignominy is the mo&s;t eligible reputation, as freedom from pain is, among &s;ome philo&s;ophers, the definition of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF we therefore compare the value of the prai&s;e obtained by fictitious excellence, even while the cheat is yet undi&s;covered, with that kindne&s;s which every man may win by his virtue, and that e&s;teem which mo&s;t men may gain by common under&s;tanding &s;teadily and hone&s;tly applied, we &s;hall find that when from the ad&s;cititious happine&s;s all the deductions are made by fear and accident, there will remain nothing equiponderant to the &s;ecurity of truth. The &s;tate of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of humble virtues, to the affecter of great excellencies, is that of a &s;mall well built cottage of &s;tone, to the palace rai&s;ed with ice by the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; it was for a time &s;plendid and luminous, but the fir&s;t &s;hun&s;hine melted it to nothing.</P>

<P>EVERY man is prompted by the love of him&s;elf to imagine, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome peculiar qualities, &s;uperior, either in kind or in degree, to tho&s;e which he &s;ees allotted to the re&s;t of the world; and, whatever apparent di&s;|advantages he may &s;uffer in the compari&s;on with others, he has &s;ome invi&s;ible di&s;tinctions, &s;ome latent re&s;erve of excellence, which he throws into the balance, and by which he ge|nerally fancies that it is turned in his favour.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudious and &s;peculative part of man|kind have always &s;eemed to con&s;ider their fra|ternity, as placed in a &s;tate of oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who are engaged in the tumult of pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s; and have plea&s;ed them&s;elves, from age to age, with celebrating the felicity of their own condition, and with recounting the perplexity of politics, the dangers of greatne&s;s, the anxieties of ambition, and the mi&s;eries of riches.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
AMONG the numerous topics of declamati|on, that their indu&s;try has di&s;covered on this &s;ubject, there is none which they pre&s;s with greater efforts, or on which they have more copiou&s;ly laid out their rea&s;on and their imagination, than the in&s;tability of high &s;tati|ons, and the uncertainty with which their profits and honours are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that mu&s;t be acquired with &s;o much hazard, vigilance and labour.</P>
<P>THIS they appear to con&s;ider as an irrefra|gable argument again&s;t the choice of the &s;tate&s;|man and the warrior; to this weapon they have always recour&s;e in their rhetorical at|tacks; and &s;well with all the confidence of victory, thus furni&s;hed by the mu&s;es with the arms which never can be blunted, and which no art or &s;trength of their adver&s;aries can elude or re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>IT was well known by experience to the nations which employed elephants in war, that, though by the terror of their bulk, and the violence of their impre&s;&s;ion, they often threw the enemy into di&s;order, yet there was always danger in the u&s;e of them, very nearly
<PB N="184" REF="185">
equivalent to the advantage; for, if their fir&s;t charge could be &s;upported, they were ea&s;ily driven back upon their confederates, they then broke through the troops behind them, and made no le&s;s havock in the precipitation of their retreat, than in the fury of their on&s;et.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether tho&s;e, who have &s;o vehemently urged the inconveniences and dan|gers of an active life, have not made u&s;e of arguments that may be retorted with equal force upon them&s;elves; and whether the hap|pine&s;s of a candidate for literary fame be not &s;ubject to the &s;ame uncertainty with that of him who governs provinces, or commands armies, pre&s;ides in the &s;enate, or dictates in the cabinet.</P>
<P>THAT eminence of learning is not to be gained without labour, at lea&s;t equal to that which any other kind of greatne&s;s can require, will &s;carcely be denied by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to elevate the character of a &s;cholar; &s;ince they cannot but know, that every human acqui&s;iti|on is valuable in proportion to the difficulty implied in its attainment. And that tho&s;e, who have gained the e&s;teem and veneration
<PB N="135" REF="186">
of the world, by their knowledge or their genius, are by no meanes exempt from the &s;olicitude which any other kind of dignity produces, may be conjectured from the innu|merable artifices which they make u&s;e of to degrade a &s;uperior, to repre&s;s a rival, or ob|&s;truct a follower; artifices &s;o gro&s;s and mean, as to be an evident proof, how ea&s;ily a man may excel in learning, without being either more wi&s;e or more virtuous than tho&s;e who&s;e igno|rance he pities or de&s;pi&s;es.</P>
<P>NOTHING therefore remains, by which the &s;tudent can gratify his de&s;ire of appearing to have built his happine&s;s on a more firm ba&s;is than his antagoni&s;t, except the certainty with which his honours are enjoyed. The garlands gained by the heroes of literature mu&s;t be gathered from &s;ummits equally difficult to climb with tho&s;e that bear the civic or tri|umphal wreaths, they mu&s;t be worn with equal envy, and guarded with equal care from tho&s;e hands that are always employed in efforts to tear them away; the only remaining hope is, that their verdure is more la&s;ting, and that they are le&s;s likely to fade by time, or le&s;s ob|noxious to the bla&s;ts of accident.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
EVEN this hope will receive very little en|couragement from the examination of the hi&s;|tory of learning, or ob&s;ervation of the fate of &s;cholars in the pre&s;ent age. If we look back into pa&s;t times, we find innumerable names of authors once in high reputation, read perhaps by the beautiful, quoted by the witty, and commented by the grave; but of whom we now know only that they once exi&s;ted. If we con&s;ider the di&s;tribution of literary fame in our own time, we &s;hall find it a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of very uncertain tenure; &s;ometimes be&s;towed by a &s;udden caprice of the publick, and again transferred to a new favourite, for no other rea&s;on than that he is new; &s;ometimes refu&s;ed to long labour and eminent de&s;ert, and &s;ome|times granted to very &s;light preten&s;ions; lo&s;t &s;ometimes by &s;ecurity and negligence, and &s;ometimes by too diligent endeavours to retain it.</P>
<P>A SUCCESSFUL author is equally in danger of the diminution of his fame, whether he continues or cea&s;es to write. The regard of the publick is not to be kept but by tribute, and the remembrance of pa&s;t &s;ervice will quickly langui&s;h unle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ive performances
<PB N="187" REF="188">
frequently revive it. Yet in every new at|tempt there is new hazard, and there are few who do not, at &s;ome unlucky time, injure their own characters by attempting to enlarge them.</P>
<P>THERE are many po&s;&s;ible cau&s;es of that inequality which we may &s;o frequently ob&s;erve in the performances of the &s;ame man, from the influence of which no ability or indu&s;try is &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, and which have &s;o often &s;ullied the &s;plendour of genius, that the wit, as well as the conqueror, may be properly cautioned not to indulge his pride with too early triumphs, but to defer to the end of life his e&s;timate of happine&s;s. <Q><L>&mdash;Ultima &s;emper</L>

<P>AMONG the motives that urge an author to undertakings by which his reputation is impair|ed, one of the mo&s;t frequent mu&s;t be mention|ed with tenderne&s;s, becau&s;e it is not to be counted among his follies, but his mi&s;eries. It very often happens that the works of learning or of wit are performed at the direction of tho&s;e by whom they are to be rewarded; the
<PB N="188" REF="189">
writer has not always the choice of his &s;ub|ject, but is compelled to accept any ta&s;k which is thrown before him, without much con&s;idera|tion of his own convenience, and without time to prepare him&s;elf for the execution by previous &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Mi&s;carriages of this kind are likewi&s;e fre|quently the con&s;equences of that acquaintance with the great, which is generally con&s;idered as one of the chief privileges of literature and genius. A man, who has once learned to think him&s;elf exalted by familiarity with tho&s;e, whom nothing but their birth, or their fortunes, or &s;uch &s;tations as are &s;eldom gained by moral excellence, &s;et above him, will not be long without &s;ubmitting his under&s;tanding to their conduct; he will &s;uffer them to pre|&s;cribe the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, and employ him for their own purpo&s;es either of diver&s;ion or intere&s;t. His de&s;ire of plea&s;ing tho&s;e who&s;e favour he has weakly made nece&s;&s;ary to him|&s;elf, will not &s;uffer him always to con&s;ider how little he is qualified for the work impo&s;ed. Either his vanity will tempt him to conceal his deficiences, or that cowardice, which always encroaches fa&s;t upon &s;uch as &s;pend their lives in the company of per&s;ons higher than them|&s;elves,
<PB N="189" REF="190">
will not leave him re&s;olution to a&s;&s;ert the liberty of choice.</P>
<P>BUT though we &s;uppo&s;e that a man by his fortune can avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of dependance, and by his &s;pirit can repel the u&s;urpations of patronage, yet he may ea&s;ily, by writing long, happen to write ill. There is a general &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of effects, in which contraries are pro|duced by periodical vici&s;&s;itudes; labour and care are rewarded with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ucce&s;s produ|ces confidence, confidence relaxes indu&s;try, and negligence ruins that reputation which accuracy had rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>He that happens not to be lulled by prai&s;e into &s;upinene&s;s, may be animated by it to un|dertakings above his &s;trength, or incited to fancy him&s;elf alike qualified for every kind of compo&s;ition, and able to comply with the public ta&s;te through all its variations. By &s;ome opinion like this, many men have been engaged at an advanced age, in attempts which they had not time to complete, and, after a few weak efforts, &s;unk into the grave with vexation to &s;ee the ri&s;ing generation gain ground upon them. That judgment which appears &s;o penetrating, when it is employ|ed
<PB N="190" REF="191">
upon the works of others, very often fails in performances where intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion can exert their power. We are blinded in examin|ing our own labours by innumerable prejudi|ces. Our juvenile compo&s;itions plea&s;e us, be|cau&s;e they bring to our minds the remembrance of youth; our later performances we are rea|dy to e&s;teem, becau&s;e we are unwilling to think that we have made no improvement; what flows ea&s;ily from the pen charms us, be|cau&s;e we read with plea&s;ure that which flatters our opinion of our own powers; what was compo&s;ed with great &s;truggles of the mind we are unwilling to reject, becau&s;e we cannot bear that &s;o much labour &s;hould be fruitle&s;s. But the reader has none of the&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and wonders that the author is &s;o unlike him|&s;elf, without con&s;idering that the &s;ame &s;oil will, with different culture, afford different products.</P>

<P>WIT and LEARNING were the children of Apollo, by different mothers; WIT was the offspring of Euphro&s;yne, and re&s;embled her in chearfulne&s;s and vivacity; LEARNING was born of Sophia, and retained her &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and caution. As their mothers were rivals, they were bred up by them, from their birth, in habitual oppo&s;ition, and all means were &s;o ince&s;&s;antly employed to impre&s;s upon them a hatred and contempt of each other, that though Apollo, who fore&s;aw the ill effects of their di&s;cord, endeavoured to &s;often them, by dividing his regard equally between them, yet his impartiality and kind|ne&s;s were without effect; the maternal ani|mo&s;ity was deeply rooted, having been inter|mingled with their fir&s;t ideas, and was con|firmed every hour, as fre&s;h opportunities occurred of exerting it. No &s;ooner were they of age to be received into the apartments of
<PB N="192" REF="193">
the other cele&s;tials, than WIT began to enter|tain Venus at her toilet, by aping the &s;olemnity of LEARNING, and LEARNING to divert Minerva at her loom, by expo&s;ing the blunders and ignorance of WIT.</P>
<P>THUS they grew up, with malice perpetually increa&s;ing, by the encouragement which each received from tho&s;e whom their mothers had per&s;uaded to patroni&s;e and &s;upport them; and each longed to be admitted to the table of Jupiter, not &s;o much for the hope of gaining honour, as of excluding a rival from all pre|ten&s;ions to regard, and of putting an ever|la&s;ting &s;top to the progre&s;s of that influence which each believed the other obtained by mean arts and fal&s;e appearances.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the day came, when they were both, with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities, received into the cla&s;s of &s;uperior deities, and allowed to take nectar from the hand of Hebe. But from that hour Concord lo&s;t her authority at the ta|ble of Jupiter. The rivals, animated by their new dignity, and incited by the alternate ap|plau&s;es of the other powers, harra&s;&s;ed each other by ince&s;&s;ant conte&s;ts, with &s;uch a regular
<PB N="193" REF="194">
vici&s;&s;itude of victory, that neither was depre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;ervable, that at the beginning of every debate, the advantage was on the &s;ide of WIT; and that, at the fir&s;t &s;allies, the whole a&s;&s;embly &s;parkled, according to Homer's ex|pre&s;&s;ion, with unextingui&s;hable merriment. But LEARNING would re&s;erve her &s;trength till the bur&s;t of applau&s;e was over, and the languor, with which the violence of joy is alway &s;uc|ceeded, began to promi&s;e more calm and patient attention. She then attempted her defence, and, by comparing one part of her antagoni&s;t's objections with another, com|monly made him confute him&s;elf; or, by &s;hewing how &s;mall a part of the que&s;tion he had taken into his view, proved that his opinion could have no weight. The audience began gradually to lay a&s;ide their prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and ro&s;e, at la&s;t, with great veneration for LEARNING, but with greater kindne&s;s for WIT.</P>
<P>THEIR conduct was, whenever they de|&s;ired to recommend them&s;elves to di&s;tinction, entirely oppo&s;ite. WIT was daring and ad|venturous; LEARNING cautious and delibe|rate.
<PB N="149" REF="195">
WIT thought nothing reproachful but dulne&s;s; LEARNING was afraid of no impu|tation, but that of error. WIT an&s;wered be|fore he under&s;tood, le&s;t his quickne&s;s of ap|prehen&s;ion &s;hould be que&s;tioned; LEARNING pau&s;ed, where there was no difficulty, le&s;t any in&s;idious &s;ophi&s;m &s;hould lie undi&s;covered. WIT perplexed every debate by rapidity and confu&s;ion; LEARNING tired the hearers with endle&s;s di&s;tinctions, and prolonged the di&s;pute without advantage, by proving that which never was denied. WIT, in hopes of &s;hin|ing, would venture to produce what he had not con&s;idered, and often &s;ucceeded beyond his own expectation, by following the train of a lucky thought; LEARNING would reject every new notion, for fear of being intangled in con&s;equences which &s;he could not fore&s;ee, and was often hindered, by her caution, from pre&s;&s;ing her advantages, and &s;ubduing her opponent.</P>
<P>BOTH had prejudices, which in &s;ome degree hindered their progre&s;s towards perfection, and left them open to attacks. Novelty was the darling of WIT, and antiquity of LEARNING. TO WIT, all that was new, was &s;pecious; to LEARNING, whatever was antient, was
<PB N="195" REF="196">
venerable. WIT, however, &s;eldom failed to divert tho&s;e whom he could not convince, and to convince was not often his ambition; LEARNING always &s;upported her opinion with &s;o many collateral truths, that, when the cau&s;e was decided again&s;t her, her arguments were remembered with admiration.</P>
<P>NOTHING was more common, on either &s;ide, than to quit their proper characters, and to hope for a compleat conque&s;t by the u&s;e of the weapons which had been employed again&s;t them. WIT would &s;ometimes labour a &s;yllogi&s;m, and LEARNING di&s;tort her features with a je&s;t; but they always &s;uffered by the experiment, and betrayed them&s;elves to con|futation or contempt. The &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of WIT was without dignity, and the merri|ment of LEARNING without vivacity.</P>
<P>THEIR conte&s;ts, by long continuance, grew at la&s;t important, and the divinities broke into parties. WIT was taken into the protection of the laughter-loving Venus, had a retinue allowed him of SMILES and JESTS, and was often permitted to dance among the GRACES. LEARNING &s;till continued the favourite of Minerva, and &s;eldom went out of
<PB N="196" REF="197">
her palace, without a train of the &s;everer virtues, cha&s;tity, temperance, fortitude, and labour. WIT, cohabiting with malice, had a &s;on named SATYR, who followed him, carrying a quiver filled with poi&s;oned arrows, which, where they once drew blood, could by no &s;kill ever be extracted. The&s;e arrows he frequently &s;hot at LEARNING, when &s;he was mo&s;t earne&s;tly or u&s;efully employed, en|gaged in ab&s;tru&s;e inquiries, or giving in&s;truc|tions to her followers. Minerva, therefore, deputed CRITICISM to her aid, who generally broke the point of SATYR'S arrows, turned them a&s;ide, or retorted them on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>JUPITER was at la&s;t angry, that the peace of the heavenly regions &s;hould be in perpetual danger of violation, and re&s;olved to di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e trouble&s;ome antagoni&s;ts to the lower world. Hither therefore they came, and carried on their antient quarrel among mortals, nor was either long without zealous votaries. WIT, by his gaiety, captivated the young; and LEARNING, by her authority, influenced the old. Their power quickly appeared by very eminent effects, theatres were built for the re|ception of wit, and colleges endowed for the re&s;idence of LEARNING. Each party endea|voured
<PB N="197" REF="198">
to outvy the other in co&s;t and magnifi|cence, and to propagate an opinion, that it was nece&s;&s;ary, from the fir&s;t entrance into life, to enli&s;t in one of the factions; and that none could hope for the regard of either divinity, who had once entered the temple of the rival power.</P>
<P>THERE were indeed a cla&s;s of mortals, by whom WIT and LEARNING were equally di&s;regarded: The&s;e were the devotees of Plutus, the god of riches; among the&s;e it &s;eldom happened that the gaiety of WIT could rai&s;e a &s;mile, or the eloquence of LEARNING procure attention. In revenge of this contempt, they agreed to incite their followers again&s;t them; but the forces that were &s;ent on tho&s;e expeditions frequently be|trayed their tru&s;t; and, in contempt of the orders which they had received, flattered the rich in public, while they &s;corned them in their hearts; and when, by this treachery, they had obtained the favour of Plutus, very frequently affected to look with an air of &s;uperiority on tho&s;e who &s;till remained in the &s;ervice of WIT and LEARNING.</P>
<P>DISGUSTED with the&s;e de&s;ertions, the two
<PB N="198" REF="199">
rivals, at the &s;ame time, petitioned Jupiter for re-admi&s;&s;ion to their native habitations, Jupiter thundered on the right-hand, and they prepared to obey the happy &s;ummons. WIT readily &s;pread his wings, and &s;oared aloft, but not being able to &s;ee far, was be wildered in the pathle&s;s immen&s;ity of the ethereal &s;paces. LEARNING, who knew the way, &s;hook her pinions; but for want of natural vigour could only take &s;hort flights: &s;o, after many efforts, they both &s;unk again to the ground, and learned, from their mutual di&s;tre&s;s, the nece&s;&s;ity of union. They therefore joined their hands, and renewed their flight: LEARNING was borne up by the vigour of WIT, and WIT guided by the per&s;picacity of LEARNING. They &s;oon reached the dwellings of Jupiter, and were &s;o endeared to each other, that they lived afterwards in perpetual concord. WIT per&s;uaded LEARNING to conver&s;e with the GRACES, and LEARNING engaged WIT in the &s;ervice of the VIRTUES. They were now the favourites of all the powers of heaven, and gladdened every banquet by their pre&s;ence. They &s;oon after married, at the command of Jupiter, and had a numerous progeny of ARTS and SCIENCES.</P>

<P>THAT every man &s;hould regulate his acti|ons by his own con&s;cience, without any regard to the opinions of the re&s;t of the world, is one of the fir&s;t precepts of moral prudence; ju&s;tified not only by the &s;uffrage of rea&s;on, which declares that none of the gifts of heaven are to lie u&s;ele&s;s, but by the voice likewi&s;e of experience, which will &s;oon inform us that, if we make the prai&s;e or blame of others the rule or motive of our conduct, we &s;hall be di&s;tracted by a boundle&s;s variety of irreconcileable judgments; be held in per|petual &s;u&s;pen&s;e between contrary impul&s;es, and con&s;ult for ever without determination.</P>

<P>OF all authors, tho&s;e who retail their la|bours in periodical &s;heets would be mo&s;t un|happy, if they were much to regard the cen|&s;ures or the admonitions of their readers; for, as their works are not &s;ent into the world at once, but by &s;mall parts in gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it is always imagined, by tho&s;e who think them|&s;elves qualified to give in&s;tructions, that they may yet redeem their former failings by hear|kening to better judges, &s;upply by new im|provements the deficiencies of their plan, and make every day advances towards perfection,
<PB N="201" REF="202">
by the help of the critici&s;ms which are &s;o li|berally afforded.</P>
<P>I HAVE had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, &s;ometimes with vexation, and &s;ometimes with merri|ment, the different temper with which the &s;ame man reads a printed and manu&s;cript per|formance. When a book is once in the hands of the public, it is con&s;idered as per|manent and unalterable; and the reader, if he be free from per&s;onal prejudices, takes it up with no other intention than of plea&s;ing or in|&s;tructing him&s;elf; he, therefore, accomo|dates his mind to the author's de&s;ign, and, ha|ving no intere&s;t in refu&s;ing the amu&s;ement that is offered him, never interrupts his own tranqullity by &s;tudied cavils, or de&s;troys his &s;atisfaction in that which is already well, by an anxious enquiry how it might be better; but is often contented without plea&s;ure, and plea&s;ed without perfection.</P>
<P>BUT if the &s;ame man be called to con&s;ider the merit of a production yet unpubli&s;hed, he brings an imagination heated with objections to pa&s;&s;ages, which he has yet never heard, he invokes all the powers of critici&s;m, and &s;tores his me|mory with Ta&s;te, and Grace, and Purity, and
<PB N="202" REF="203">
Delicacy, and Manners, and Unities, &s;ounds which, having been once uttered by tho&s;e that under&s;tood them, have been &s;ince re-echo|ed without meaning, and kept up to the di&s;|turbance of the world, by a con&s;tant reper|cu&s;&s;ion from one coxcomb to another. He con&s;iders him&s;elf as obliged to &s;hew, by &s;ome proof of his abilities, that he is not con&s;ulted to no purpo&s;e, and, therefore, watches every opening for objection, and looks round for every opportunity to propo&s;e &s;ome &s;pecious alteration. Such opportunities a very &s;mall degre of &s;agacity will enable him to find; for, in every work of imagination, the di&s;po&s;ition of parts, the in&s;ertion of incidents, and u&s;e of decorations, may be varied a thou&s;and ways with equal propriety; and as, in things near|ly equal, that will always &s;eem be&s;t to every man which he him&s;elf produces, the critic, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is only to propo&s;e, without the care of execution, can never want the &s;a|tisfaction of believing that he has &s;ugge&s;ted very important improvements, nor the power of enforcing his advice by arguments, which, as they appear convincing to him&s;elf, either his kindne&s;s, or his vanity, will pre&s;s ob&s;ti|nately and importunately, without &s;u&s;picion that he may po&s;&s;ibly judge too ha&s;tily in favour
<PB N="203" REF="204">
of his own advice, or inquiry whether the advantage of the new &s;cheme be proportionate to the labour.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, by the younger Pliny, that an orator ought not &s;o much to &s;elect the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t arguments which his cau&s;e ad|mits, as to employ all which his imagination can afford; for, in pleading, tho&s;e rea&s;ons are of mo&s;t value, which will mo&s;t affect the judges; and the judges, &s;ays he, will be al|ways mo&s;t touched with that which they had before conceived. Every man, who is called to give his opinion of a performance, decides upon the &s;ame principle; he fir&s;t &s;uffers him|&s;elf to form expectations, and then is angry at his di&s;appointment. He lets his imaginati|on rove at large, and wonders that another, equally unconfined in the boundle&s;s ocean of po&s;&s;ibility, takes a different cour&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT, though the rule of Pliny be judiciou&s;ly laid down, it is not applicable to the writer's cau&s;e, becau&s;e there always lies an appeal from dome&s;tick critici&s;m to a higher judicature, and the publick, which can never be corrupted, nor often deceived, is to pa&s;s the la&s;t &s;entence upon literary claims.</P>

OF the great force of preconceived opinions I had many proofs, when I fir&s;t entered upon this weekly labour. All my readers having, from the performances of my predece&s;&s;ors, e&s;tabli&s;hed an idea of unconnected e&s;&s;ays, to which they believed all future authors under a nece&s;&s;ity of conforming, were impatient of the lea&s;t deviation from their &s;y&s;tem, and nu|merous remon&s;trances were accordingly made by each, as he found his favourite topicks omitted or delayed. Some were angry that the RAMBLER did not, like the SPECTATOR, introduce him&s;elf to the acquaintance of the publick, by an account of his own birth and &s;tudies, an enumeration of his adventures, and a de&s;cription of his phy&s;iognomy. Others &s;oon began to remark that he was a &s;olemn, &s;erious, dictatorial writer, without &s;prightline&s;s or gaiety, and called out with vehemence for mirth and humour. Another admoni&s;hed him to have a &s;pecial eye upon the various clubs of this great city, and informed him that much of the Spectator's vivacity was laid out upon &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies. He has been likewi&s;e cen&s;ured for not imitating the politene&s;s of o|ther writers of the &s;ame kind, for having hitherto neglected to take the ladies under his

protection, and to give them rules for the ju&s;t oppo&s;ition of colours, and the proper dimen&s;i|ons of ruffles and pinners. He has been re|quired by another to fix a particular cen&s;ure upon tho&s;e matrons who play at cards with &s;pectacles. And another is very much offend|ed whenever he meets with a &s;peculation, in which naked precepts are compri&s;ed, without being enlivened by examples and characters.</P>
<P>I MAKE not the lea&s;t que&s;tion that all the&s;e monitors intend the promotion of my de&s;ign, and the plea&s;ure and in&s;truction of my readers; but they do not know, or do not reflect that an author has a rule of choice peculiar to him|&s;elf; and &s;elects tho&s;e &s;ubjects which he is be&s;t qualified to treat, by the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, or the accidents of his life; that ma|ny topicks of amu&s;ement are exhau&s;ted, and are now improper, becau&s;e they have been alrea|dy treated with too much art to invite a com|petition; and that he who endeavours to gain many readers, mu&s;t try many arts of invitati|on, e&s;&s;ay every avenue of plea&s;ure, and make frequent changes in his methods of ap|proach.</P>

THIS is, indeed, a dictate, which, in the whole extent of its meaning, may be &s;aid to compri&s;e all the &s;peculation requi&s;ite to a mo|ral agent.

<P>WE might have had more &s;atisfaction con|cerning the original import of this celebrated &s;entence, if hi&s;tory had informed us, whe|ther it was uttered as a general in&s;truction to mankind, or as a particular caution to &s;ome private inquirer; whether it was applied to &s;ome &s;ingle occa&s;ion, or laid down as the uni|ver&s;al rule of life.</P>

<P>WHEN a man employs him&s;elf upon remote and unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ubjects, and wa&s;tes his life upon que&s;tions, which cannot be re&s;olved, and of which the &s;olution would conduce very lit|tle to the advancement of happine&s;s; when he bewilders his under&s;tanding in uncertain hy|pothe&s;es, and harra&s;&s;es his faculties with need|le&s;s &s;ubtilties; when he lavi&s;hes his hours in calculating the weight of the terraqueous globe, or in adju&s;ting &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of worlds be|yond the reach of the tele&s;cope; he may be very properly recalled from his excur&s;ions by this precept, and reminded that there is a being with which it is his duty, and his inte|re&s;t to be more acquainted; and from which, though he cannot neglect it without the ut|mo&s;t danger, his attention has hitherto been withheld, by his regard to &s;tudies, which he

<P>THE great prai&s;e of Socrates is, that he drew the wits of Greece, by his in&s;truction and example, from the vain per&s;uit of natu|ral philo&s;ophy to moral inquiries, and turned their thoughts from &s;tars and tides, and mat|ter and motion, upon the various modes of virtue, and relations of life.

<P>GELIDUS is a man of great penetration,
<PB N="210" REF="211">
and deep re&s;earches. Having a mind natural|ly formed for the ab&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences, he can comprehend intricate combinations without confu&s;ion, and being of a temper naturally cool and equal, he is &s;eldom interrupted by his pa&s;&s;ions in the per&s;uit of the longe&s;t chain of unexpected con&s;equences. He has, there|fore, a long time indulged hopes, that the &s;olution of &s;ome problems, by which the profe&s;|&s;ors of &s;cience have been hitherto baffled, is re|&s;erved for his genius and indu&s;try. He &s;pends his time in the highe&s;t room of his hou&s;e, into which none of his family are &s;uffered to enter; and when he comes down to his dinner, or his re&s;t, he walks about like a &s;tranger that is there only for a day, without any tokens of regard or tenderne&s;s. He has totally dive&s;ted him|&s;elf of all human &s;en&s;ations; he has neither eye for beauty, nor ear for complaint; he neither rejoices at the good fortune of his near|e&s;t friend, nor mourns for any publick or pri|vate calamity. Having once received a letter which appeared to have been &s;ent by &s;ea, and given it his &s;ervant to read, he was informed, that it was written by his brother, who, being &s;hip-wrecked, had &s;wum naked to land, and was de&s;titute of nece&s;&s;aries in a foreign coun|try.

<P>THE family of Gelidus once broke into his &s;tudy, to &s;hew him that a town at a &s;mall di&s;|tance was on fire, and in a few moments a &s;ervant came up to tell him, that the flame had caught &s;o many hou&s;es on both &s;ides, that the inhabitants were confounded, and began to think rather of e&s;caping with their lives, than &s;aving their dwellings.

<P>I SHALL re&s;erve to &s;ome future paper the more religious and important meanings of this epitome of wi&s;dom, and only remark at pre|&s;ent, that it may be applied to the gay and light, as well as to the grave and &s;olemn parts of life; and that not only the philo&s;opher may forfeit his pretences to real learning by neglect|ing this nece&s;&s;ary &s;tudy, but that the wit, and the beauty, may mi&s;carry in their &s;chemes, for want of this univer&s;al requi&s;ite, the know ledge of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is &s;urely for no other rea&s;on, that we &s;ee &s;uch numbers, in every order of mankind, re|&s;olutely &s;truggling again&s;t nature, and contend|ing for that which they never can attain, en|deavouring to unite contradictions, and de|termined to excel in characters incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; that &s;tock-jobbers affect dre&s;s, gaiety, and elegance, and that mathe|maticians labour to be wits; that the &s;oldier teazes his acquaintance with que&s;tions in theo|logy, and the academick hopes to divert the

ladies by a recital of his gallantries. That ab&s;urdity of pride could proceed only from ignorance of them&s;elves, by which Garth at|tempted critici&s;m, and Congreve waved his ti|tle to dramatick reputation, and de&s;ired to be con&s;idered only as a gentleman.</P>
<P>EUPHUES, with great parts, and exten&s;ive knowledge, has a clouded a&s;pect, and ungra|cious form; yet it has been his ambition, from his fir&s;t entrance into life, to di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf by particularities in his dre&s;s, to outvie beaus in embroidery, to import new trimmings, and to be foremo&s;t in the fa&s;hion. Euphues has turned on his exterior appearance, that attention, which would always have produced e&s;teem had it been fixed upon his mind; and, though his real virtues, and acknowledged abi|lities, have pre&s;erved him from the contempt which he has &s;o diligently &s;olicited, he has, at lea&s;t, rai&s;ed one impediment to his reputation; &s;ince all can judge of his dre&s;s, but few of his under&s;tanding; and many who di&s;cern that he is a fop, are unwilling to believe that he can be wi&s;e, or learned.</P>

They hope &s;till to inflame the heart by glances which have lo&s;t their fire, or melt it by languor which is no longer delicate; they play over the airs which plea&s;ed at a time when they were expected only to plea&s;e, and forget that airs ought in time to give place to virtues. They continue to trifle, becau&s;e they could once trifle agreeably, till tho&s;e who &s;hared their early plea&s;ures are withdrawn to more &s;erious engagements; and are &s;carcely awakened from their dream of perpetual youth, but by frequent experience of the &s;corn of tho&s;e whom they endeavour to rival.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are &s;ome vices and errors, which, though often fatal to tho&s;e in whom they are found, have yet, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind, been con&s;idered as entitled
<PB N="215" REF="216">
to &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, or have, at lea&s;t, been exempted from contemptuous infamy, and condemned by the &s;evere&s;t morali&s;ts with pity rather than dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>A CONSTANT and invariable example of this general partiality will be found in the dif|ferent regard which has always been &s;hown to ra&s;hne&s;s and cowardice, two vices, of which, though they may be conceived equally di&s;tant from the middle point, where true fortitude is placed, and may equally injure any publick or private intere&s;t, yet the one is never mention|ed without &s;ome kind of veneration, and the other always con&s;idered as a topick of unli|mited and licentious cen&s;ure, on which all the virulence of reproach may be lawfully exerted.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame di&s;tinction is made, by the com|mon &s;uffrage, between profu&s;ion and avarice, and, perhaps, between many other oppo&s;ite vices: and, as I have found rea&s;on to pay great regard to the voice of the people, in mo&s;t ca&s;es where knowledge has been forced upon them by experience without long deduc|tions or deep re&s;earches, I am inclined to be|lieve that this di&s;tribution of re&s;pect, however
<PB N="216" REF="217">
unequal it may appear at fir&s;t view, is not without &s;ome agreement with the nature of things; and that in the faults, which are thus inve&s;ted with extraordinary privileges, there are generally &s;ome latent principles of merit, &s;ome po&s;&s;ibilities of future virtue, which may, by degrees, break from ob&s;truction, and by time and opportunity be brought into act.</P>
<P>IT may be laid down, as an acknowledged axiom, that it is more ea&s;y to take away &s;uper|fluities than to &s;upply defects; and, therefore, he that is culpable, becau&s;e he has pa&s;&s;ed the middle point of virtue, is always accounted a fairer object of hope, than he who fails by falling &s;hort. The one has all that perfection requires and more, but the exce&s;s may be ea&s;ily retrenched; the other wants the quali|ties requi&s;ite to excellence, and who can tell how he &s;hall obtain them? We are certain that the hor&s;e may be taught to keep pace with his fellows, who&s;e fault is that he leaves them behind. We know that a few &s;trokes of the axe will lop a cedar; but what arts of cultivation can elevate a &s;hrub?</P>
<P>TO walk with circum&s;pection and &s;teadine&s;s in the right path, at an equal di&s;tance between
<PB N="217" REF="218">
the extremes of error, ought to be the con&s;tant endeavour of every rea&s;onable being; nor can I think tho&s;e teachers of moral wi&s;dom much to be honoured as benefactors to mankind, who are always enlarging upon the difficulty of our duties, and providing rather excu&s;es for vice, than incentives to virtue.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ince to mo&s;t it will happen often, and to all &s;ometimes, that there will be a deviation towards one &s;ide or the other, we ought always to employ our vigilance, with mo&s;t attention, on that enemy from which there is greate&s;t danger, and to &s;tray, if we mu&s;t &s;tray, towards tho&s;e parts, from whence it is probable that we &s;hall quickly and ea&s;ily return.</P>
<P>AMONG other oppo&s;ite qualities of the mind, which may become dangerous, though in different degrees, I have often had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the contrary effects of pre&s;umption and de&s;pondency; of heady confidence, which promi&s;es victory without conte&s;t, and heartle&s;s pu&s;illanimity, which &s;hrinks back from the thoughts of great undertakings, confounds difficulty with impo&s;&s;ibility, and con&s;iders all advancement towards any new attainment as irrever&s;ibly prohibited.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="219">
PRESUMPTION will be ea&s;ily corrected. Every experiment will teach caution, and mi&s;|carriages will hourly &s;hew, that attempts are not always rewarded with &s;ucce&s;s. The mo&s;t precipitate ardour will, in time, be taught the nece&s;&s;ity of methodical gradation, and prepa|ratory mea&s;ures; and the mo&s;t daring confi|dence be convinced that neither merit, nor abi|lities, can command events.</P>
<P>IT is the advantage of vehemence and activi|ty, that they are always ha&s;tening to their own reformation; becau&s;e they always incite us to try whether our expectations are well grounded, and therefore detect the deceits which they are apt to occa&s;ion. But timidity is a di&s;ea&s;e of the mind more ob&s;tinate and fatal; for he who is once per&s;uaded, that any impediment is in|&s;uperable, has given it, with re&s;pect to him|&s;elf, that &s;trength and weight which it had not before. He can &s;carcely &s;trive with vigour and per&s;everance, when he has no hope of gaining the victory; and &s;ince he never will try his &s;trength, can never di&s;cover the unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of his fears.</P>
<P>THERE is often to be found in men devoted
<PB N="219" REF="220">
to literature, a kind of intellectual cowardice, which whoever conver&s;es much among them may ob&s;erve frequently to depre&s;s the alacrity of enterpri&s;e, and, by con&s;equence, to retard the improvement of &s;cience. They have an|nexed to every &s;pecies of knowledge &s;ome chimerical character of terror and inhibition, which they tran&s;mit, without much reflection, from one to another, and with which they fir&s;t fright them&s;elves, and then propagate the pa|nic to their &s;cholars and acquaintance. One &s;tudy is incon&s;i&s;tent with a lively imagination, another with a &s;olid judgment; one is impro|per in the early parts of life, another requires &s;o much time, that it is not to be attempted at an advanced age; one is dry and contracts the &s;entiments, another is diffu&s;e and overbur|dens the memory; one is in&s;ufferable to ta&s;te and delicacy, and another wears out life in the &s;tudy of words, and is u&s;ele&s;s to a wi&s;e man, who de&s;ires only the knowledge of things.</P>
<P>BUT of all the bugbears by which the <HI>In|fantes barbati,</HI> boys both young and old, have been hitherto frighted from digre&s;&s;ing into new tracts of learning, none has been more mi&s;|chievou&s;ly efficacious than an opinion that e|very kind of knowledge requires a peculiar ge|nius,
<PB N="220" REF="221">
or mental con&s;titution, framed for the reception of &s;ome ideas, and the exclu&s;ion of others; and that to him who&s;e genius is not adapted to the &s;tudy which he pro&s;ecutes, all labour &s;hall be vain and fruitle&s;s, vain as an en|deavour to mingle oil and water, or, in the language of chemi&s;try, to amalgamate bodies of heterogeneous principles.</P>
<P>THIS opinion we may rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect to have been propagated, by vanity, beyond the truth. It is natural for tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed a reputation by any &s;cience, to exalt them&s;elves as endowed by heaven with peculiar powers, or marked out by an extraordinary de&s;ignation for their profe&s;&s;ion; and to fright competitors away by repre&s;enting the difficulties with which they mu&s;t contend, and the nece&s;&s;ity of qualities which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be not generally conferred, and which no man can know, but by experience, whether he enjoys.</P>
<P>TO this di&s;couragement it may be po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wered, that &s;ince a genius, whatever it be, is like fire in the flint, only to be produced by colli&s;ion with a proper &s;ubject, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every man to try whether his faculties may not happily co-operate with his de&s;ires; and
<PB N="221" REF="222">
&s;ince they who&s;e proficiency he admires, knew their own force only by the event, he needs but engage in the &s;ame undertaking, with equal &s;pirit, and may rea&s;onably hope for equal &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;pecies of fal&s;e intelli|gence, given by tho&s;e who profe&s;s to &s;hew the way to the &s;ummit of knowledge, of equal tendency to depre&s;s the mind with fal&s;e di&s;tru&s;t of it&s;elf, and weaken it by needle&s;s &s;olicitude and dejection. When a &s;cholar, whom they de&s;ire to animate, con&s;ults them at his entrance on &s;ome new &s;tudy, it is common to make flat|tering repre&s;entations of its plea&s;antne&s;s and facility. Thus they generally attain one of two ends almo&s;t equally de&s;irable; they either incite his indu&s;try by elevating his hopes, or produce a high opinion of their own abilities, &s;ince they are &s;uppo&s;ed to relate only what they have found, and to have proceeded with no le&s;s ea&s;e than they promi&s;e to their fol|lowers.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudent inflamed by this encourage|ment &s;ets forward in the new path, and pro|ceeds a few &s;teps with great alacrity, but he &s;oon finds a&s;perities and intricacies of which he has
<PB N="222" REF="223">
not been forewarned, and imagining that none ever were &s;o entangled or fatigued before him, &s;inks &s;uddenly into de&s;pair, and de&s;i&s;ts as from an expedition in which fate oppo&s;es him. Thus his terrors are multiplied by his hopes, and he is defeated without re&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e he had no expectation of an enemy.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e treacherous in&s;tructors, the one de|&s;troys indu&s;try, by declaring that indu&s;try is vain, the other by repre&s;enting it as needle&s;s; the one cuts away the root of hope, the other rai&s;es it only to be bla&s;ted. The one confines his pupil to the &s;hore, by telling him that his wreck is certain, the other &s;ends him to &s;ea, without preparing him for tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>FALSE hopes and fal&s;e terrors are equally to be avoided. Every man, who propo&s;es to grow eminent by learning, &s;hould carry in his mind, at once, the difficulty of excellence and the force of indu&s;try; and remember that &s;ame is not conferred but as the recompen&s;e of labour, and that labour, vigorou&s;ly continued, has not often failed of its reward.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is u&s;ual for men, engaged in the &s;ame per&s;uits, to be inqui&s;itive after the conduct and fortune of each other; and, therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be unplea&s;ing to you, to read an account of the various changes which have happened in part of a life devoted to literature. My narrative will not exhibit any great variety of events, or extraordinary revolutions; but may, perhaps, be not le&s;s u&s;eful, becau&s;e I &s;hall relate nothing which is not likely to happen to a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P>I WAS born heir to a very &s;mall fortune, and left by my father, whom I cannot remember, to the care of an uncle, who, having no chil|dren, always treated me as his &s;on, and find|ing in me tho&s;e qualities which old men ea&s;ily di&s;cover in &s;prightly children, when they hap|pen to love them, declared that a genius like
<PB N="224" REF="225">
mine &s;hould never be lo&s;t for want of cultivati|on. He therefore placed me, for the u&s;ual time, at a great &s;chool, and then &s;ent me to the univer&s;ity, with a larger allowance than my own patrimony would have afforded, that I might not keep mean company, but learn to become my dignity when I &s;hould be made lord chancellor, which he often lamented, that the increa&s;e of his infirmities was very likely to preclude him from &s;eeing.</P>
<P>THIS exuberance of money naturally di&s;|played it&s;elf in gayety of appearance, and wantonne&s;s of expence, and introduced me to the acquaintance of tho&s;e whom the &s;ame &s;uperfluity of fortune betrayed to the &s;ame li|cence and o&s;tentation: Young heirs, who plea&s;ed them&s;elves with a remark very frequent in their mouths, that though they were &s;ent by their fathers to the univer&s;ity, they were not under the nece&s;&s;ity of living by their learn|ing.</P>
<P>AMONG men of this cla&s;s I ea&s;ily obtained the reputation of a great genius, and was per|&s;uaded that, with &s;uch liveline&s;s of imagina|tion, and delicacy of &s;entiment, I &s;hould ne|ver be able to &s;ubmit to the drudgery of the
<PB N="225" REF="226">
law. I therefore gave my&s;elf wholly to the more airy and elegant parts of learning, and was often &s;o much elated with my &s;uperiority to the youths with whom I conver&s;ed, that I began to li&s;ten, with great attention, to tho&s;e that recommended to me a wider and more con&s;picuous theatre; and was particu|larly touched with an ob&s;ervation, made by one of my friends; That it was not by lin|gering in the univer&s;ity, that Prior became amba&s;&s;ador, or Addi&s;on &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;ire was hourly increa&s;ed by the &s;olicitation of my companions, who removing one by one to London as the caprice of their relations allowed them, or as their legal di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from the hands of their guardians put it in their power, never failed to &s;end an account of the beauty and felicity of the new world, and to remon&s;trate how much was lo&s;t by every hour's continuance in a place of retirement and con&s;traint.</P>
<P>My uncle in the mean time frequently har|ra&s;&s;ed me with monitory letters, which I &s;ome|times neglected to open for a week after I re|ceived them, and generally read in a tavern with &s;uch comments as might &s;hew how much
<PB N="226" REF="227">
I was &s;uperior to in&s;truction or advice. I could not but wonder, how a man con|fined to the country, and unacquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, &s;hould ima|gine him&s;elf qualified to in&s;truct a ri&s;ing geni|us, born to give laws to the age, refine its ta&s;te, and multiply its plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE po&s;tman, however, &s;till continued to bring me new remon&s;trances; for my uncle was very little depre&s;&s;ed by the ridicule and reproach which he never heard. But men of parts have quick re&s;entments; it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to bear his u&s;urpations for ever; and I re|&s;olved, once for all, to make him an example to tho&s;e who imagine them&s;elves wi&s;e becau&s;e they are old, and to teach young men, who are too tame under repre&s;entation, in what manner grey-bearded in&s;olence ought to be treated. I, therefore, one evening took my pen in hand, and, after having animated my|&s;elf with a catch, wrote a general an&s;wer to all his precepts, with &s;uch vivacity of turn, &s;uch elegance of irony, and &s;uch a&s;perity of &s;arca&s;m, that I convul&s;ed a large company with univer&s;al laughter, di&s;turbed the neigh|bourhood with voci&s;erations of applau&s;e, and
<PB N="227" REF="228">
five days afterwards was an&s;wered, that I mu&s;t be content to live upon my own e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS contraction of my income gave me no di&s;turbance, for a genius like mine was out of the reach of want. I had friends that would be proud to open their pur&s;es at my call, and pro&s;pects of &s;uch advancement as would &s;oon reconcile my uncle, whom, upon mature deliberation, I re&s;olved to receive into favour, without in&s;i&s;ting on any acknowledgment of his offence, when the &s;plendour of my condi|tion &s;hould induce him to wi&s;h for my coun|tenance. I, therefore, went up to London, before I had &s;hewn the alteration of my con|dition by any abatement of my way of living, and was received by all my academical ac|quaintance with triumph and congratulation. I was immediately introduced among the wits and men of &s;pirit; and, in a &s;hort time, had dive&s;ted my&s;elf of all my &s;cholar's gravity, and obtained the reputation of a pretty fel|low.</P>
<P>YOU will ea&s;ily believe that I had no great knowledge of the world; yet I had been hin|dered, by the general di&s;inclination every man feels to confe&s;s poverty, from telling to any
<PB N="228" REF="229">
one the re&s;olution of my uncle, and for &s;ome time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;tock of money which I had brought with me, and contributed my &s;hare as before to all our entertainments. But my pocket was &s;oon emptied, and I was obliged to a&s;k my friends for a &s;mall &s;um. This was a favour, which we had often reciprocally re|ceived from one another; they &s;uppo&s;ed my wants only accidental, and therefore willing|ly &s;upplied them. In a &s;hort time, I found a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king again, and was again treated with the &s;ame civility; but the third time they began to wonder what that old rogue my uncle could mean by &s;ending a gentleman to town without money; and when they gave me what I a&s;ked for, advi&s;ed me to &s;tipulate for more regular remittances.</P>
<P>THIS &s;omewhat di&s;turbed my dream of con&s;tant affluence, but I was three days after completely awaked; for entering the tavern, where we met every evening, I found the waiters remitted their complai&s;ance, and, in|&s;tead of contending to light me up &s;tairs, &s;uf|fered me to wait for &s;ome minutes by the bar. When I came to my company I found them unu&s;ually grave and formal, and one of them took a hint to turn the conver&s;ation upon the
<PB N="229" REF="230">
mi&s;conduct of young men, and enlarged upon the folly of frequenting the company of men of fortune, without being able to &s;upport the expence, an ob&s;ervation which the re&s;t con|tributed either to enforce by repetition, or to illu&s;trate by examples. Only one of them tri|ed to divert the di&s;cour&s;e, and endeavoured to direct my attention to remote que&s;tions, and common topicks.</P>
<P>A MAN guilty of poverty ea&s;ily believes him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, I went, however, next morn|ing to breakfa&s;t with him who appeared igno|rant of the drift of the conver&s;ation, and by a &s;eries of enquiries, drawing &s;till nearer to the point, prevailed on him, not, perhaps, much again&s;t his will, to inform me, that Mr <HI>Da&s;h,</HI> who&s;e father was a wealthy attorney near my native place, had, the morning before, receiv|ed an account of my uncle's re&s;entment, and communicated his intelligence with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try of groveling in&s;olence.</P>
<P>IT was now no longer practicable to con&s;ort with my former friends, unle&s;s I would be content to be u&s;ed as an inferior gue&s;t, who was to pay for his wine by mirth and flattery; a character, which, if I could not e&s;cape it, I
<PB N="230" REF="231">
re&s;olved to endure only among tho&s;e who had never known me in the pride of plenty. I therefore changed my lodgings, and frequented the coffee-hou&s;es in a different region of the town; where I was very quickly di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal young gentlemen of high birth, and large e&s;tates, and began again to amu&s;e my imagination with hopes of preferment, though not quite &s;o confidently as when I had le&s;s experience.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t great conque&s;t which this new &s;cene enabled me to gain over my&s;elf, was, when I &s;ubmitted to confe&s;s to a party, who invited me to an expen&s;ive diver&s;ion, that my revenues were not equal to &s;uch golden plea|&s;ures; they would not &s;uffer me, however, to &s;tay behind, and with great reluctance I yield|ed to be treated. I took that opportunity of recommending my&s;elf to &s;ome office, or employment, which they unanimou&s;ly promi|&s;ed to procure me by their joint intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAD now entered into a &s;tate of depen|dence, and had hopes, or fears, from almo&s;t every man whom I &s;aw. If it be unhappy to have one patron, what is his mi&s;ery who has many? I was obliged to comply with a thou|&s;and
<PB N="231" REF="232">
caprices, to concur in a thou&s;and follies, and to countenance a thou&s;and errors. I en|dured innumerable mortifications, if not from cruelty, at lea&s;t from negligence, which will creep in upon the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t delicate minds, when they conver&s;e without the mutu|al awe of equal circum&s;tances. I found the &s;pirit and vigour of liberty every moment &s;ink|ing in me, and a &s;ervile fear of di&s;plea&s;ing, &s;teal|ing by degrees upon all my behaviour, till no word, or look, or action, was my own. As the &s;olicitude to plea&s;e increa&s;ed, the power of plea&s;ing grew le&s;s, and I was always clouded with diffidence where it was mo&s;t my intere&s;t and wi&s;h to &s;hine.</P>
<P>MY patrons, con&s;idering me as belonging to the community, and, therefore, not the charge of any particular per&s;on, made no &s;cruple of neglecting any opportunity of pro|moting me, &s;ince every one thought it more properly the bu&s;ine&s;s of another. An account of my expectations and di&s;appointments, and the &s;ucceeding vici&s;&s;itudes of my life, I &s;hall give you in my following letter, which will be, I hope, of u&s;e to &s;hew how ill he forms his &s;chemes, who expects happine&s;s without free|dom.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is natural for every man to think him&s;elf of importance, your know|ledge of the world will incline you to forgive me, if I imagine your curio&s;ity &s;o much excited, by the former part of my narration, as to make you de&s;ire that I &s;hould proceed without any unnece&s;&s;ary arts of con|nection. I &s;hall, therefore, not keep you longer in &s;uch &s;u&s;pen&s;e, as, perhaps, my performance may not compen&s;ate.</P>
<P>IN the gay company with which I was now united, I found tho&s;e allurements and delights, which the friend&s;hip of young men always affords; there was that openne&s;s which naturally produced confidence, that affability which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;oftened dependence, and that ardour of pro&s;e&s;&s;ion which incited hope. When our hearts were dilated with merriment, promi&s;es were poured out with
<PB N="233" REF="234">
unlimited profu&s;ion, and life and fortune were but a &s;canty &s;acrifice to friend&s;hip; but when the hour came, at which any effort was to be made, I had generally the vexation to find, that my intere&s;t weighed nothing again&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t amu&s;ement, and that every petty avocation was &s;ound a &s;ufficient plea for con|tinuing me in uncertainty and want. Their kindne&s;s was, indeed, &s;incere; when they promi&s;ed they had no intention to deceive, but the &s;ame juvenile warmth which kindled their benevolence, gave force in the &s;ame proportion to every other pa&s;&s;ion, and I was forgotten as &s;oon as any new plea&s;ure &s;eized on their attention.</P>
<P>VAGARIO told me one evening, that all my perplexities &s;hould be &s;oon at an end, and de&s;ired me, from that in&s;tant, to throw upon him all care of my fortune, for a po&s;t of con|&s;iderable value was that day become vacant, and he knew his intere&s;t &s;ufficient to procure it in the morning. He de&s;ired me, therefore, to call on him early, that he might be dre&s;&s;ed &s;oon enough to wait on the mini&s;ter before any other application &s;hould be made. I came as he appointed, with all the flame of gratitude, and was told by his &s;ervant, that
<PB N="234" REF="235">
having found at his lodgings, when he came home, an acquaintance, who was going to travel, he had been per&s;uaded to accompany him to Dover, and that they had taken po&s;t|hor&s;es two hours before day.</P>
<P>I WAS once very near to preferment, by the kindne&s;s of Charinus, who, at my reque&s;t, went to beg a place, which he thought me likely to fill with great reputation, and in which I &s;hould have many opportunities of promoting his intere&s;t in return; and he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with imagining the mutual benefits that we &s;hould confer, and the advances that we &s;hould make by our united &s;trength. Away therefore he went, equally warm with friend&s;hip and ambition, and left me to prepare acknowledgments again&s;t his return. At length he came, and told me that he had met in his way a party going to break|fa&s;t in the country, that the ladies importuned him too much to be refu&s;ed, and that having pa&s;&s;ed the morning with them, he was come back to dre&s;s him&s;elf for a ball, to which he was invited for the evening.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;uffered &s;everal di&s;appointments from taylors and perriwig-makers, who by
<PB N="235" REF="236">
neglecting to perform their work withheld my patrons from court; and once failed of an e|&s;tabli&s;hment for life by the delay of a &s;ervant, &s;ent to a neighbouring &s;hop to repleni&s;h a &s;nuff-box.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t I thought my &s;olicitude at an end, for an office fell into the gift of Hippodamus's father, who being then in the country, could not very &s;peedily fill it, and who&s;e fondne&s;s would not have &s;uffered him to re|fu&s;e his &s;on a le&s;s rea&s;onable reque&s;t. Hippo|damus therefore &s;et forward with great ex|pedition, and I expected every hour an account of his &s;ucce&s;s. A long time I waited with|out any intelligence, but at la&s;t received a letter from Newmarket, by which I was in|formed, that, as he had heard on the road, the races were begun, and I knew the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ions too well to imagine that he could refu&s;e him&s;elf his favourite amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>YOU will not wonder that I was at la&s;t weary of the patronage of young men, e|&s;pecially as I found them not generally to promi&s;e much greater fidelity as they advanced in life; for I ob&s;erved that what they gained in &s;teadine&s;s they lo&s;t in benevolence, and
<PB N="236" REF="237">
grew colder to my intere&s;t as they became more diligent to promote their own. I was convinced that their liberality was only pro|fu&s;ene&s;s, that, as chance directed, they were equally generous to vice and virtue, that they were warm but becau&s;e they were thought|le&s;s, and counted the &s;upport of a friend only among&s;t other gratifications of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MY re&s;olution was now to ingratiate my&s;elf with men who&s;e reputation was e&s;tabli&s;hed, who&s;e high &s;tations enabled them to prefer me, and who&s;e age exempted them from &s;udden changes of inclination. I was con&s;idered as a man of parts, and therefore ea&s;ily found admi&s;&s;ion to the table of Hilarius, the celebrated orator renowned equally for the extent of his knowledge, the elegance of his diction, and the acutene&s;s of his wit. Hilarius received me with an appearance of great &s;atisfaction, pro|duced to me all his friends, and directed to me that part of his di&s;cour&s;e in which he mo&s;t endeavoured to di&s;play his imagination. I had now learned my own intere&s;t enough to &s;upply him opportunities for &s;mart remarks and gay &s;allies, which I never failed to ocho and ap|plaud. Thus I was gaining every hour on his affections, till unfortunately, when the a&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="237" REF="238">
was more &s;plendid than u&s;ual, his de|&s;ire of admiration prompted him to turn his raillery upon me. I bore it for &s;ome time with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and his &s;ucce&s;s en|couraged him to redouble his attacks; at la&s;t my vanity prevailed over my prudence, I re|torted his irony with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that Hila|rius, unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;i&s;tance, was di&s;con|certed, and &s;oon found means of convincing me that his purpo&s;e was not to encourage a rival, but to fo&s;ter a para&s;ite.</P>
<P>I WAS then taken into the familiarity of Ar|gutio, a nobleman eminent for judgment and critici&s;m. He had contributed to my reputation, by the prai&s;es which he had often be&s;towed upon my writings, in which he always owned that there were proofs of a genius that might ri&s;e to high de|grees of excellence, when time, or information, had reduced its exuberance. He therefore always required me to con&s;ult him before the publication of any new performance, and commonly propo&s;|ed innumerable alterations, without &s;ufficient at|tention to the general de&s;ign, and without any re|gard to my form of &s;tyle, or mode of imagination. But the&s;e corrections he never failed to pre&s;s as indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and thought the lea&s;t delay of compliance an act of rebellion.
<PB N="238" REF="239">
The pride of an author made this treatment in&s;ufferable, and I thought any tyranny ea&s;ier to be born than that which took from me the u&s;e of my under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>MY next patron was Eutyches the &s;tate&s;|man, who was wholly engaged in publick affairs, and &s;eemed to have no ambition but to be powerful and rich. I found his favour more permanent than that of the others, for there was always a certain price at which it might be bought; he allowed nothing to humour, or to affection, but was always ready to pay liberally for the &s;ervice that he required. His demands were, indeed, very often &s;uch as virtue could not ea&s;ily con&s;ent to gratify; but virtue is not to be con&s;ulted when men are to rai&s;e their fortunes by the favour of the great. His mea&s;ures were cen&s;ured; I wrote in his defence, and was rewarded with a place, of which the profits were never received by me without the pangs of remembering that they were the reward of wickedne&s;s, a reward which nothing but that nece&s;&s;ity, which the con&s;umption of my little e&s;tate in the&s;e wild per&s;uits had brought upon me, hindered me from throwing back in the face of my cor|ruptor.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="240">
AT this time my uncle died without a will, and I became heir to a &s;mall fortune. I had re&s;olution to throw off the &s;plendour which reproached me to my&s;elf, and retire to an humbler &s;tate, in which I am now endea|vouring to recover the dignity of virtue, and hope to make &s;ome reparation for my crime and follies, by informing others, who may be led after the &s;ame pageants, that they are a|bout to engage in a cour&s;e of life, in which they are to purcha&s;e, by a thou&s;and mi&s;eries, the privilege of repentance.</P>

<P>I HAVE endeavoured, in a late e&s;&s;ay, to &s;hew into what errors men are hourly be|trayed by a mi&s;taken opinion of their own powers, and a negligent in&s;pection of their own character. But as I then confined my

ob&s;ervations to common occurrences, and fa|miliar &s;cenes, I think it proper to enquire how far a nearer acquaintance with our|&s;elves is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ervation from crimes as well as follies, and how much the attentive &s;tudy of our own minds may con|tribute to &s;ecure to us the approbation of that being, to whom we are accountable both for our thoughts and our actions, and who&s;e favour mu&s;t finally con&s;titute our total happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF it be rea&s;onable to e&s;timate the difficulty of any enterpri&s;e by the frequent mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e who undertake it, it may ju&s;tly be concluded that it is not ea&s;y for a man to know him&s;elf; for where&s;oever we turn our view, we &s;hall find almo&s;t all with whom we conver&s;e &s;o nearly as to know their &s;entiments, indulging more favourable conceptions of their own virtue than they have been able to impre&s;s upon others, and congratulating them&s;elves upon degrees of excellence, which their fond|e&s;t admirers cannot allow them to have at|tained.</P>
<P>THOSE repre&s;entations of imaginary vir|tue are, generally con&s;idered as arts of
<PB N="241" REF="242">
hypocri&s;y, and as &s;nares laid for confidence and prai&s;e. But, I believe, that this &s;u&s;picion is often unju&s;t, and that tho&s;e who thus propagate their own reputation, only ex|tend the fraud by which they have been them|&s;elves deceived; for this failing is incident to numbers, who &s;eem to live without de&s;igns, competitions, or per&s;uits; it appears on occa|&s;ions which promi&s;e no acce&s;&s;ion of honour or of profit, and to per&s;ons from whom very little is to be hoped or feared. It is, indeed, not ea&s;y to tell how far we may be blinded by the love of our&s;elves, when we reflect how much a &s;econdary pa&s;&s;ion can cloud our judg|ment, and how few faults a man, in the fir&s;t raptures of love, can di&s;cover in the per&s;on or conduct of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>TO lay open all the &s;ources from which er|ror flows in upon him who contemplates his own character, would require more exact knowledge of the human heart, than, perhaps, the mo&s;t acute and laborious ob&s;ervers have acquired. And, &s;ince fal&s;ehood may be diver&s;i|fied without end, it is not unlikely that every man admits an impo&s;ture in &s;ome re&s;pect pecu|liar to him&s;elf, as his views have been accidental|ly directed, or his ideas particularly combined.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
SOME fallacies, however, there are more frequently in&s;idious, which it may, perhaps, not be u&s;ele&s;s to detect, becau&s;e though they are gro&s;s they may be fatal, and becau&s;e no|thing but attention is nece&s;&s;ary to defeat them.</P>
<P>ONE &s;ophi&s;m by which men per&s;uade them|&s;elves that they have tho&s;e virtues which they really want, is formed by the &s;ub&s;titution of &s;ingle acts for habits. A mi&s;er who once re|lieved a friend from the danger of a pri&s;on, &s;uffers his imagination to dwell for ever upon his own heroick genero&s;ity; he yields his heart up to indignation at tho&s;e who are blind to merit, or in&s;en&s;ible to mi&s;ery, and who can plea&s;e them&s;elves with the enjoyment of that wealth, which they never permit others to partake. From any cen&s;ures of the world, or reproaches of his con&s;cience, he has an appeal to action and to knowledge; and though his whole life is a cour&s;e of rapacity and avarice, he concludes him&s;elf to be tender and liberal, becau&s;e he has once performed an act of libera|lity and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>AS a gla&s;s which magnifies objects by the approach of one end to the eye, le&s;&s;ens them
<PB N="243" REF="244">
by the application of the other, &s;o vices are ex|tenuated by the inver&s;ion of that fallacy, by which virtues are augmented. Tho&s;e faults which we cannot conceal from our own no|tice, are con&s;idered, however frequent, not as habitual corruptions, or &s;ettled practices, but as ca&s;ual failures, and &s;ingle lap&s;es. A man who has, from year to year, &s;et his country to &s;ale, either for the gratification of his am|bition or re&s;entment, confe&s;&s;es that the heat of party now and then betrays the &s;evere&s;t vir|tue to mea&s;ures that cannot be &s;eriou&s;ly de|fended. He that &s;pends his days and nights in riot and debauchery, owns that his pa&s;&s;ions oftentimes overpower his re&s;olution. But each comforts him&s;elf that his faults are not with|out precedent, for the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t men have given way to the violence of &s;udden temptations.</P>
<P>THERE are men who always confound the prai&s;e of goodne&s;s with the practice, and who believe them&s;elves mild and moderate, chari|table and faithful, becau&s;e they have exerted their eloquence in commendation of mildne&s;s, fidelity, and other virtues. This is an error almo&s;t univer&s;al among tho&s;e that conver&s;e much with dependents, with &s;uch who&s;e fear
<PB N="244" REF="245">
or intere&s;t di&s;po&s;es them to a &s;eeming reve|rence for any declamation, however enthu&s;i|a&s;tick, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any boa&s;t, however arrogant. Having none to recall their attenti|on to their lives, they rate them&s;elves by the goodne&s;s of their opinions, and forget how much more ea&s;ily men may &s;hew their virtue in their talk than in their actions.</P>
<P>THE tribe is likewi&s;e very numerous of tho&s;e who regulate their lives, not by the &s;tand|ard of religion, but the mea&s;ure of other men's virtue; who lull their own remor&s;e with the remembrance of crimes more atrocious than their own, and &s;eem to believe that they are not bad while another can be &s;ound wor&s;e.</P>
<P>FOR e&s;caping the&s;e and a thou&s;and other deceits, many expedients have been propo&s;ed. Some have recommended the frequent con&s;ul|tation of a wi&s;e friend, admitted to intimacy, and encouraged to &s;incerity. But this appears a remedy by no means adapted to general u&s;e: for in order to &s;ecure the virtue of one, it pre|&s;uppo&s;es more virtue in two than will generally be found. In the fir&s;t, &s;uch a de&s;ire of rectitude and amendment, as may incline him
<PB N="245" REF="246">
to hear his own accu&s;ation from the mouth of him whom he e&s;teems, and by whom, there|fore, he will always hope that his faults are not di&s;covered; and in the &s;econd &s;uch zeal and hone&s;ty, as will make him content for his friend's advantage to lo&s;e his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>A LONG life may be pa&s;&s;ed without finding a friend in who&s;e under&s;tanding and virtue we can equally con&s;ide, and who&s;e opinion we can value at once for its ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;incerity. A weak man, however hone&s;t, is not qualified to judge. A man of the world, however penetrating, is not fit to coun&s;el. Friends are often cho&s;en for &s;imilitude of manners, and therefore each palii|ates the other's &s;ailings, becau&s;e they are his own. Friends are tender and unwilling to give pain, or they are intere&s;ted, and fearful to offend.</P>
<P>THESE objections have inclined others to advi&s;e, that he who would know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould con&s;ult his enemies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">+proaches that are vented to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> for the cen&s;ures that are uttered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> For his great bu&s;ine&s;s is to know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> and tho&s;e malignity will di&s;cover, and re&s;ent+ment will reveal.

rivals or opponents are &s;uffered to come near enough to know our conduct with &s;o much exactne&s;s as that con&s;cience &s;hould allow and reflect the accu&s;ation. The charge of an enemy is &s;ometimes fal&s;e, and commonly &s;o mingled with fal&s;ehood, that the mind takes advantage from the failure of one part to di&s;|credit the re&s;t, and never &s;uffers any di&s;turbance afterward from &s;uch partial reports.</P>
<P>YET it &s;eems that enemies have been always found by experience the mo&s;t faithful moni|tors; for adver&s;ity has ever been con&s;idered as the &s;tate in which a man mo&s;t ea&s;ily becomes acquainted with him&s;elf, and this effect it mu&s;t produce by withdrawing flatterers and dependents, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to hide our weakne&s;&s;es and our errors from us, and by giving loo&s;e to malice, and licence to re|proach; or at lea&s;t by cutting off tho&s;e plea|&s;ures which called us away from meditation on our conduct, and repre&s;&s;ing that pride which too ea&s;ily per&s;uades us, that we merit whatever we enjoy.</P>

<P>The apparent nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting the would at a di&s;tance from us, when we are re&s;olved to take a nearer &s;urvey of our&s;elves, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> many from high &s;tations to the &s;everities of a mona&s;tick life; and, indeed, every man deep|ly engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, if all regard to another &s;tate be not extingui&s;hed, mu&s;t have the con|viction, tho', perhaps, not the re&s;olution of Valde&s;&s;o, who, when he &s;olicited Charles the fifth to di&s;mi&s;s him, being a&s;ked, whether he retired upon di&s;gu&s;t, an&s;wered that he laid down his commi&s;&s;ion, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e <HI>there ought to be &s;ome time for &s;ober reflection between the life of a &s;oldier and his death.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is nothing recommended with greater frequency among the gave-poets of antiquity, than the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent hour, and the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of all the cares which intrude upon our quiet, or hinder, by importunate perturbations, the enjoyment of tho&s;e delights which our con|dition happens to &s;et before us.</P>
<P>THE ancient poets are, indeed, by no means unexceptionable teachers of morality;
<PB N="250" REF="251">
their precepts are to be always con&s;idered as the &s;allies of a genius, intent rather upon giving plea&s;ure than in&s;truction, eager to take every advantage of in&s;inuation, and, pro|vided the pa&s;&s;ions can be engaged on its &s;ide, very little &s;olicitous about the &s;uffrage of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE darkne&s;s and uncertainty through which the heathens were compelled to wander in the per&s;uit of happine&s;s, may, indeed, be alleged as an excu&s;e for many of their &s;educing invitations to immediate enjoyment, which the moderns, by whom they have been imitated, have not to plead. It is no wonder that &s;uch as had no promi&s;e of another &s;tate &s;hould eagerly turn their thoughts upon the improvement of that which was before them; but &s;urely tho&s;e who are acquainted with the hopes and fears of eternity, might think it nece&s;&s;ary to put &s;ome re&s;traint upon their imagination, and reflect that by echoing the &s;ongs of the ancient bacchanals, and tran&s;mitting the maxims of pa&s;t debauchery, they not only prove that they want invention, but virtue, and &s;ubmit to the &s;ervility of imitation only to copy that of which the writer, if he was to live now, would often be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="252">
YET as the errors and follies of a great genius are &s;eldom without &s;ome radiations of under&s;tanding, by which meaner minds may be enlightened, the incitements to plea&s;ure are, in the&s;e authors, generally mingled with &s;uch reflections upon life, as well de&s;erve to be con&s;idered di&s;tinctly from the pur|po&s;es for which they are produced, and to be trea&s;ured up as the &s;ettled conclu&s;ions of exten&s;ive ob&s;ervation, acute &s;agacity, and mature experience.</P>
<P>IT is certainly not without ju&s;t reflection that on the&s;e occa&s;ions they often warn their readers again&s;t enquiries into futurity, and &s;olicitude about events which lie hid in cau&s;es yet unactive, and which time has not brought forward into the view of rea&s;on. For as an idle and thoughtle&s;s re&s;ignation to chance, without any &s;truggle again&s;t calamity, or en|deavour after advantage, is below the dignity of a rea&s;onable being, in who&s;e power pro|vidence has put a great part even of his pre|&s;ent happine&s;s, &s;o it &s;hews an equal ignorance of our proper &s;phere, to harra&s;s our thoughts with conjectures about things not yet in being. How can we regulate events, of which we
<PB N="252" REF="253">
yet know not whether they will ever happen. And why &s;hould we think, with painful anxiety, about that on which our thoughts can have no influence?</P>
<P>IT is a maxim commonly received, that a wi&s;e man is never &s;urpri&s;ed; and, perhaps, this exemption from a&s;toni&s;hment may be ima|gined to proceed from &s;uch a pro&s;pect into fu|turity, as gave previous intimation of tho&s;e evils which often fall unexpected upon others that have le&s;s fore&s;ight. But the truth is, that things to come, except when they ap|proach very nearly, are equally hidden from men of all degrees of under&s;tanding; and if a wi&s;e man is not amazed at &s;udden occurren|ces, it is not that he has thought more, but le&s;s upon futurity. He never con&s;idered things not yet exi&s;ting as the proper objects of his attention; he never indulged dreams till he was deceived by their phantoms, nor ever rea|lized non-entities to his mind. He is not &s;ur|pri&s;ed becau&s;e he is not di&s;appointed, and he e&s;capes di&s;appointment becau&s;e he never forms any expectations.</P>
<P>THE concern about things to come, that is to ju&s;tly cen&s;ured, is not the re&s;ult of tho&s;e ge|neral
<PB N="253" REF="254">
reflections, on the variablene&s;s of fortune, the uncertainty of life, and the univer&s;al in|&s;ecurity of all human acqui&s;itions, which mu&s;t always be &s;ugge&s;ted by the view of the world; but &s;uch a de&s;ponding anticipation of misfortune, as fixes the mind upon &s;cenes of gloom and melancholy, and makes fear pre|dominate in every imagination.</P>
<P>ANXIETY of this kind is nearly of the &s;ame nature with jealou&s;y in love, and &s;u&s;picion in the general commerce of life; a temper which keeps the man always in alarms, di&s;|po&s;es him to judge of every thing in a manner that lea&s;t favours his own quiet, fills him with perpetual &s;tratagems of counteraction, wears him out in &s;chemes to obviate evils which never threatened him, and at length, perhaps, con|tributes to the production of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs of which it had rai&s;ed &s;uch dreadful appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT has been u&s;ual in all ages for morali&s;ts to repre&s;s the &s;wellings of vain hope by repre&s;en|tations of the innumerable ca&s;ualties to which life is &s;ubject, and by in&s;tances of the unex|pected defeat of the wi&s;e&s;t &s;chemes of policy, and &s;udden &s;ubver&s;ions of the highe&s;t eminen|ces
<PB N="254" REF="255">
of greatne&s;s. It has, perhaps, not been equally ob&s;erved, that all the&s;e examples afford the proper antidote to fear as well as to hope, and may be applied with no le&s;s efficacy as con&s;olations to the timorous, than as re&s;traints to the proud.</P>
<P>EVIL is uncertain in the &s;ame degree as good, and for the rea&s;on that we ought not to hope too &s;ecurely, we ought not to fear with too much dejection. The &s;tate of the world is continually changing, and none can tell the re&s;ult of the next vici&s;&s;itude. What|ever is afloat in the &s;tream of time, may, when it is very near us, be driven away by an accidental bla&s;t, which &s;hall happen to cro&s;s the general cour&s;e of the current. The &s;udden accidents by which the powerful are depre&s;&s;ed, may fall upon tho&s;e who&s;e malice we fear; and the greatne&s;s by which we expect to be overborn, may become another proof of the fal&s;e flatteries of fortune. Our enemies may become weaker, or we grow &s;trong before our encounter, or we may advance again&s;t each other without ever meeting. There are, indeed, natural evils which we can flatter our|&s;elves with no hopes of e&s;caping, and with little of delaying; but of the ills which are
<PB N="255" REF="256">
apprehended from human malignity, or the op|po&s;ition of rival intere&s;ts, we may always alle|viate the terror by con&s;idering that our per&s;e|cutors are weak and ignorant, and mortal like our&s;elves. The misfortunes which ari&s;e from the concurrence of unhappy circum&s;tances &s;hould never be &s;uffered to di&s;turb us before they happen; becau&s;e, if the brea&s;t be once laid open to the dread of mere po&s;&s;ibilities of mi&s;ery, life mu&s;t be given a prey to di&s;mal &s;olicitude, and quiet mu&s;t be lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>IT is remarked by old Cornaro, that it is ab&s;urd to be afraid of the natural di&s;&s;olution of the body; becau&s;e it mu&s;t certainly happen, and can, by no caution, or artifice, be avoid|ed. Whether this &s;entiment be entirely ju&s;t, I &s;hall not examine; but certainly, if it be improper to fear events which mu&s;t happen, it is yet more evidently contrary to right rea&s;on to fear tho&s;e which may never happen, and which, if they &s;hould come upon us, we cannot re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>AS we ought not to give way to fear any more than indulgence to hope, becau&s;e the objects both of fear and hope are yet uncer|tain, &s;o we ought not to tru&s;t the repre&s;entati|ons of one more than of the other, becau&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="257">
they are both equally fallacious; as hope en|larges happine&s;s, fear aggravates calamity. It is generally allowed, that no man ever found the happine&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion proportionate to that expectation which incited his de&s;ire, and invigorated his per&s;uit; nor has any man found the evils of life &s;o formidable in reality, as they were de&s;cribed to him by his own ima|gination; every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s brings with it &s;ome peculiar &s;upports, &s;ome unfore&s;een means of re&s;i&s;ting, or power of enduring. For this rea&s;on, Taylor ju&s;tly blames &s;ome pious per&s;ons, who indulged their own fancies too much, &s;et them&s;elves, by the force of ima|gination, in the place of the ancient martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors, and que&s;tion the validity of their own faith becau&s;e they &s;hrink at the thoughts of flames and tortures. It is, &s;ays he, &s;ufficient that you are able to encounter the temptations which now a&s;&s;ault you; when God &s;ends trials, he may &s;end &s;trength.</P>
<P>ALL fear is in it&s;elf painful, and when it conduces not to &s;afety is painful without u&s;e. Every con&s;ideration, therefore, by which groundle&s;s terrors may be removed, adds &s;ome|thing to human happine&s;s. It is likewi&s;e not unworthy of remark, that in proportion as
<PB N="257" REF="258">
our cares are imployed upon the future, they are ab&s;tracted from the pre&s;ent, from the only time which we can call our own, and of which if we neglect the apparent duties, to make vain provi&s;ion again&s;t vi&s;ionary attacks, we &s;hall cer|tainly counteract our own purpo&s;e; for he, doubtle&s;s, mi&s;takes his true intere&s;t, who thinks that he can increa&s;e his &s;afety, when he impairs his virtue.</P>

<P>THIS is the more grievous, as it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid being in all &s;orts of places and companies; and I am therefore liable to meet with perpetual affronts and injuries. Though I have as natural an antipathy to cards and dice, as &s;ome people have to a cat, many and many an a&s;&s;embly am I forced to endure; and though re&s;t and compo&s;ure are my peculiar joy, am worn out, and harra&s;&s;ed to death with journies by men and women of quality, who never take one, but when I can be of the party. Some, on a contrary extreme, will never receive me but in bed, where they &s;pend at lea&s;t half of the time I have to &s;tay with them; and others are &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly ill|bred as to take phy&s;ick on purpo&s;e when they have rea&s;on to expect me. Tho&s;e who keep upon terms of more politene&s;s with me, are generally &s;o cold and con&s;trained in their be|haviour, that I cannot but perceive my&s;elf an unwelcome gue&s;t; and even among per&s;ons de&s;erving of e&s;teem, and who certainly have
<PB N="260" REF="261">
a value for me, it is too evident that generally whenever I come I throw a dulne&s;s over the whole company, that I am entertained with a formal &s;tiff civility, and that they are glad when I am fairly gone.</P>
<P>HOW bitter mu&s;t this kind of reception be to one formed to in&s;pire delight, admiration and love! To one capable of an&s;wering and rewarding the greate&s;t warmth and delicacy of &s;entiments!</P>
<P>I WAS bred up among a &s;et of excellent people, who affectionately loved me, and treated me with the utmo&s;t honour and re|&s;pect. It would be tedious to relate the variety of my adventures, and &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of my fortune in many different countries. Here in <HI>England</HI> there was a time when I lived according to my heart's de&s;ire. When|ever I appeared, publick a&s;&s;emblies appointed for my reception were crowded with per&s;ons of quality and fa&s;hion, early dre&s;t as for a court, to pay me their devoirs. Chearful ho&s;pitality every where crowned my board, and I was looked upon in every country pari&s;h as a kind of &s;ocial bond between the '&s;quire' the par&s;on, and the tenants. The laborious
<PB N="261" REF="262">
poor every where ble&s;t my appearance: they do &s;o &s;till, and keep their be&s;t clothes to do me honour; though as much as I delight in the hone&s;t country folks, they do now and then throw a pot of ale at my head, and &s;ometimes an unlucky boy will drive his cricket-ball full in my face.</P>
<P>EVEN in the&s;e my be&s;t days there were per&s;ons who thought me too demure and grave. I mu&s;t for&s;ooth by all means be in&s;tructed by foreign ma&s;ters, and taught to dance and play. This method of education was &s;o contrary to my genius, formed for much nobler entertain|ments, that it did not &s;ucceed at all.</P>
<P>I FELL next into the hands of a very different &s;et. They were &s;o exce&s;&s;ively &s;candalized at the gayety of my appearance, as not only to de&s;poil me of the foreign fop|peries, the paint and the patches that I had been tricked out with by my la&s;t misjudging tutors, but they robbed me of every innocent ornament I had from my infancy been u&s;ed to gather in the fields and gardens; nay they blacked my face, and covered me all over with a habit of mourning, and that too very coar&s;e and aukward. I was now obliged to
<PB N="262" REF="263">
&s;pend my whole life in hearing &s;ermons; nor permitted &s;o much as to &s;mile upon any occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN this melancholy di&s;gui&s;e I became a perfect bugbear to all children and young folks. Wherever I came there was a general hu&s;h, an immediate &s;top to all plea&s;antne&s;s of look or di&s;cour&s;e; and not being permitted to talk with them in my own language at that time, they took &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t to me in tho&s;e tedious hours of yawning, that having tran&s;|mitted it to their children, I cannot now be heard, though 'tis long &s;ince I have recovered my natural form, and plea&s;ing tone of voice. Would they but receive my vi&s;its kindly, and li&s;ten to what I could tell them&mdash;let me &s;ay it without vanity&mdash;how charming a companion &s;hould I be! to every one could I talk on the &s;ubjects mo&s;t intere&s;ting and mo&s;t plea&s;ing. With the great and ambitious, I would di&s;|cour&s;e of honours and advancements, of di&s;|tinctions to which the whole world &s;hould be witne&s;s, of unenvied dignities and durable preferments. To the rich I would tell of inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures, and the &s;ure method to attain them. I would teach them to put out their money on the be&s;t intere&s;t, and in|&s;truct
<PB N="263" REF="264">
the lovers of plea&s;ure how to &s;ecure and improve it to the highe&s;t degree. The beauty &s;hould learn of me how to pre&s;erve an everla&s;ting bloom. To the afflicted I would admini&s;ter comfort, and relaxation to the bu&s;y.</P>
<P>AS I dare promi&s;e my&s;elf you will atte&s;t the truth of all I have advanced, there is no doubt but many will be de&s;irous of improving their acquaintance with me; and that I may not be thought too difficult, I will tell you, in &s;hort, how I wi&s;h to be received.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know I equally hate lazy idle|ne&s;s and hurry. I would every where be wel|comed at a tolerably early hour with decent good-humour and gratitude. I mu&s;t be at|tended in the great halls peculiarly appropriated to me with re&s;pect; but I do not in&s;i&s;t upon finery: propriety of appearance, and perfect neatne&s;s is all I require. I mu&s;t at dinner be treated with a temperate, but a chearful &s;ocial meal; both the neighbours, and the poor &s;hould be the better for me. Some time I mu&s;t have tete a tete with my kind entertain|ers, and the re&s;t of my vi&s;it &s;hould be &s;pent in plea&s;ant walks and airings among &s;ets of agree|able

<P>THOUGH the fallibility of man's rea&s;on, and the narrowne&s;s of his knowledge, are very generally and liberally confe&s;&s;ed, yet if an enquiry be made into the conduct of tho&s;e who &s;o willingly admit the weakne&s;s of human nature, there will appear &s;ome rea&s;on for imagining that this acknowledgment is not altogether &s;incere, at lea&s;t, that mo&s;t make it with a tacit re&s;erve in favour of them&s;elves, and that with whatever ea&s;e they give up the
<PB N="265" REF="266">
claims of their neighbours, they are de&s;irous of being thought exempt from faults in their own conduct, and from error in their opinions.</P>
<P>THE certain and ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, which we may ob&s;erve made to confutation, however clear, and to reproof however tender, is an undoubted argument, that &s;ome dormant pri|vilege is thought to be attacked; for as no man can lo&s;e what he neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, nor imagines him&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor be defrauded of that to which he has no right, it is rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e who break out in|to fury at the fir&s;t attacks of contradiction, or the &s;lighte&s;t touches of cen&s;ure, &s;ince they apparently conclude them&s;elves injured, mu&s;t fancy their honour impaired, &s;ome antient im|munity violated, or &s;ome natural prerogative invaded; to be mi&s;taken, if they thought them&s;elves liable to mi&s;take, could not be con|&s;idered by them as either &s;hameful or wonder|ful, and they would not &s;urely receive with &s;o much emotion intelligence which only inform|ed them of that which they knew before, nor &s;truggle with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s again&s;t an attack that deprived them of nothing to which they held them&s;elves entitled.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">
IT is related of one of the philo&s;ophers, that when an account was brought him of his &s;on's death, he received it only with this re|flection, <HI>I knew that my &s;on was mortal.</HI> He that is convinced of an error, if he had the &s;ame knowledge of his own weakne&s;s, would, in&s;tead of kindling with re&s;entment, &s;training for artifices, and brooding malignity, only regard &s;uch over&s;ights as the appendages of humanity, and pacify him&s;elf with con&s;idering that he had always known man to be a falli|ble being.</P>
<P>IF it be true that mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions are excited by the novelty of objects, there is little rea&s;on for doubting that to be con&s;idered as &s;ubject to fallacies of ratiocination, or imper|fection of knowledge, is to a very great part of mankind entirely new; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to enter any place of general re&s;ort, or fall into any company where there is not &s;ome regular and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ubordination, without finding rage and vehemence produced only by diffe|rence of &s;entiments about things very trifling, in which neither of the di&s;putants have any other intere&s;t than what proceeds from their mutual unwillingne&s;s to give way to any opi|nion
<PB N="267" REF="268">
that may bring upon them the di&s;grace of being wrong.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of men that, having advanced &s;ome erroneous doctrines in philo&s;ophy, have refu&s;ed to &s;ee the experiments by which they were confuted: and the ob&s;ervation of every day will give new proofs with how much in|du&s;try &s;ubterfuges and eva&s;ions are &s;ought to decline the pre&s;&s;ure of re&s;i&s;tle&s;s arguments, how often the &s;tate of the que&s;tion is altered, how often the antagoni&s;t is wilfully mi&s;repre|&s;ented, and in how much perplexity the cleare&s;t po&s;itions are involved by tho&s;e whom they happen to ob&s;truct in the exten&s;ion or propa|gation of a plea&s;ing hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>OF all mortals none &s;eem to have been more infected with this &s;pecies of vanity, than the race of writers, who&s;e reputation ari&s;ing &s;olely from their under&s;tanding, has given them a very delicate &s;en&s;ibility of any violence at|tempted on their literary honour. It is not unplea&s;ing to remark with what &s;olicitude men of acknowledged abilities will endeavour to palliate ab&s;urdities and reconcile contradictions, only to obviate critici&s;ms to which all human performances mu&s;t ever be expo&s;ed, and from
<PB N="268" REF="269">
which they can never &s;uffer, but when they teach the world by a vain and ridiculous impa|tience to think them of importance.</P>
<P>DRYDEN, who&s;e warmth of fancy, and ha&s;te of compo&s;ition very frequently hurried him into inaccuracres, heard him&s;elf &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to ridicule for having &s;aid in one of his tragedies, <Q>I follow fate, which does too fa&s;t per&s;ue.</Q> That no man could at once follow and be fol|lowed was, it may be thought, too plain to be long di&s;puted; and the truth is, that DRYDEN was apparently betrayed into the blunder by the double meaning of the word FATE, to which in the former part of the ver&s;e he had annexed the idea of FORTUNE, and in the latter that of DEATH; &s;o that the &s;en&s;e only was, <HI>though per&s;ued by</HI> DEATH<HI>, I will not re&s;ign my&s;elf to de&s;pair, but will follow</HI> FORTUNE<HI>, and do and &s;uffer what is appointed.</HI> This however was not completely expre&s;&s;ed, and DRYDEN being determined not to give way to his critics, never confe&s;&s;ed that he had been &s;urpri&s;ed by an ambiguity; but finding luckily in <HI>Virgil</HI> an account of a man moving in a circle, with this expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Et &s;e &s;equitur|que fugitque,</HI> "Here, &s;ays he, is the pa&s;&s;age in
<PB N="269" REF="270">
imitation of which I wrote the line that my critics were plea&s;ed to condemn as non&s;en&s;e; not but I may &s;ometimes write non&s;en&s;e, though they have not the fortune to find it."</P>
<P>EVERY one &s;ees the folly of &s;uch mean doublings to e&s;cape the per&s;uit of critici&s;m; nor is there a &s;ingle reader of this poet, who would not have paid him greater veneration, had he &s;hewn con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s enough of his own &s;uperiority to &s;et &s;uch cavils at defiance, and owned that he &s;ometimes &s;lipped into errors by the tumult of his imagination, and the multi|tude of his ideas.</P>
<P>IT is however happy when this temper di&s;|covers it&s;elf only in little things, which may be right or wrong without any influence on the virtue or happine&s;s of mankind. We may, with very little inquietude, &s;ee a man per&s;i&s;t in a project, which he has found to be imprac|ticable, live in an inconvenient hou&s;e becau&s;e it was contrived by him&s;elf, or wear a coat of a particular cut, in hopes by per&s;everance to bring it into fa&s;hion. The&s;e are indeed follies, but they are only follies, and, how|ever
<PB N="270" REF="271">
wild or ridiculous, can very little af|fect others.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch pride, once indulged, too fre|quently operates upon more important objects, and inclines men not only to vindicate their errors, but their vices; to per&s;i&s;t in practices which their own hearts condemn, only le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eem to feel reproaches, or be made wi&s;er by the advice of others; or to &s;earch for &s;ophi&s;ms tending to the confu&s;ion of all principles, and the evacuation of all du|ties, that they may not appear to act what they are not able to defend.</P>
<P>LET every man, who finds vanity &s;o far predominant, as to betray him to the danger of this la&s;t degree of corruption, pau&s;e a moment to con&s;ider what will be the con&s;equences of the plea which he is about to offer for a practice to which he knows him&s;elf not led at fir&s;t by rea|&s;on, but to which he was impelled by the vio|lence of de&s;ire, &s;urprized by the &s;uddenne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;educed by the &s;oft approaches of temptation, and by imperceptible gradations of guilt. Let him con&s;ider what he is going to commit by forcing his under&s;tanding to pa|troni&s;e
<PB N="271" REF="272">
tho&s;e appetites, which it is its chief bu&s;ine&s;s to hinder and reform.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of virtue requires &s;o little art to defend it, and good and evil, when they have been once &s;hewn, are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed, that &s;uch apologi&s;ts &s;eldom gain pro&s;elytes to their party, nor have their fallacies power to deceives any but tho&s;e who&s;e de&s;ires have cloud|ed their di&s;cernment. All that the be&s;t fa|culties thus employed can perform is, to per|&s;uade the hearers that the man is hopele&s;s whom they only thought vitious, that corruption has pa&s;&s;ed from his manners to his principles, that all endeavours for his recovery are without pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and that nothing remains but to avoid him as infectious, or hunt him down as de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>BUT if it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he may impo&s;e on his audience by partial repre&s;entations of con|&s;equences, intricate deductions of remote cau|&s;es, or perplexed combinations of ideas, which having various relations appear different as viewed on different &s;ides; that he may &s;ome|times puzzle the weak and well-meaning, and now and then &s;educe, by the admiration of his abilities, a young mind &s;till fluctuating
<PB N="272" REF="273">
in un&s;ettled notions, and neither fortified by in&s;truction nor enlightened by experience; yet what mu&s;t be the event of &s;uch a triumph? A man cannot &s;pend all this life in frolick: age, or di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;olitude will bring &s;ome hours of &s;erious con&s;ideration, and it will then afford no comfort to think, that he has extend|ed the dominion of vice, that he has loaded him&s;elf with the crimes of others, and can never know the extent of his own wickedne&s;s, or make reparation for the mi&s;chief that he has cau&s;ed. There is not perhaps in all the &s;tories of ideal angui&s;h, a thought more pain|ful, than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having propaga|ted corruption by vitiating principles, of ha|ving not only drawn others from the paths of virtue, but blocked up the way by which they &s;hould return, of having blinded them to eve|ry beauty but the paint of plea&s;ure, and deaf|ened them to every call but the alluring voice of the &s;yrens of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another danger in this prac|tice: men who cannot deceive others, are ve|ry often &s;ucce&s;sful in deceiving them&s;elves; they weave their &s;ophi&s;try till their own rea|&s;on is entangled, and repeat their po&s;itions till they are credited by them&s;elves; by often con|tending
<PB N="273" REF="274">
they grow &s;incere in the cau&s;e, and by long wi&s;hing for demon&s;trative arguments they at la&s;t bring them&s;elves to fancy that they have found them. They are then at the utter|mo&s;t verge of wickedne&s;s, and may die with|out having that light rekindled in their minds, which their own pride and contumacy have extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE men who can be charged with fewe&s;t failings, either with re&s;pect to abilities or vir|tue, are generally mo&s;t ready to allow them; for not to dwell on things of &s;olemn and aw|ful con&s;ideration, the humility of confe&s;&s;ors, the tears of &s;aints, and the dying terrors of per&s;ons eminent for piety and innocence, it is well known that Cae&s;ar wrote an account of the errors committed by him in his wars of Gaul, and that Hippocrates a name perhaps in rational e&s;timation greater than Cae&s;ar's, warned po&s;terity again&s;t a mi&s;take into which he had fallen. <HI>So much,</HI> &s;ays Cel&s;us, <HI>does the open and artle&s;s confe&s;&s;ion of an error become a man con&s;ci|ous that he has enough remaining to &s;upport his character.</HI></P>
<P>AS all error is meanne&s;s, it is incumbent on every man who con&s;ults his own dignity, to
<PB N="274" REF="275">
retract it as &s;oon as he di&s;covers it, without fearing any cen&s;ure &s;o much as that of his own mind. As ju&s;tice requires that all injuries &s;hould be repaired, it is the duty of him who has &s;educed others by bad practices, or fal&s;e notions, to endeavour that &s;uch as have adopt|ed his errors &s;hould know his retraction, and that tho&s;e who have learned vice by his exam|ple, &s;hould by his example be taught amend|ment.</P>

<P>SO large a part of human life pa&s;&s;es in a &s;tate contrary to our natural de&s;ires, that one of the principal topics of moral in&s;truction is the art of bearing calamities. And &s;uch is the certainty of evil, that it is the duty of every man to furni&s;h his mind with tho&s;e principles that may enable him to act under it with de|cency and propriety.</P>
<P>THE &s;ect of antient philo&s;ophers, that boa&s;ted to have carried this nece&s;&s;ary &s;cience to
<PB N="275" REF="276">
the highe&s;t perfection, were the &s;toics, or &s;cholars of Zeno, who&s;e wild enthu&s;ia&s;tick vir|tue pretended to an exemption from the &s;en|&s;ibilities of unenlightened mortals, and who proclaimed them&s;elves exalted, by the doc|trines of their &s;ect, above the reach of tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which embitter life to the re&s;t of the world. They therefore removed pain, pover|ty, lo&s;s of friends, exile, and violent death, from the catalogue of evils; and pa&s;&s;ed, in their haughty &s;tile, a kind of irrever&s;ible de|cree, by which they forbad them to be count|ed any longer among the objects of terror or anxiety, or to give any di&s;turbance to the tran|quillity of a wi&s;e man.</P>
<P>THIS edict indeed was, I think, not uni|ver&s;ally ob&s;erved, for though one of the more re&s;olute, when he was tortured by a violent di&s;ea&s;e cried out, that let pain harra&s;s him to its utmo&s;t power, it &s;hould never force him to retract the doctrines of his &s;ect, or to con&s;ider it as other than indifferent and neutral; yet all had not &s;tubbornne&s;s to hold out again&s;t their &s;en&s;es: for one of <HI>Zeno</HI>'s pupils is recorded to have confe&s;&s;ed in the angui&s;h of the gout, that <HI>he now found pain to be an evil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="277">
IT may however be que&s;tioned, whether the&s;e philo&s;ophers can be very properly num|bered among the teachers of patience; for if pain be not an evil there &s;eems no in&s;truction requi&s;ite how it may be born, and therefore when they endeavour to arm their followers with arguments again&s;t it, they may be thought to have given up their fir&s;t po&s;ition. But &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies are to be expected from the greate&s;t under&s;tandings, when they endeavour to grow eminent by &s;ingularity, and employ their &s;trength in e&s;tabli&s;hing opinions oppo|&s;ite to nature.</P>
<P>THE controver&s;y about the reality of exter|nal evils is now at an end. That life has ma|ny mi&s;eries, and that tho&s;e mi&s;eries are, &s;ome|times at lea&s;t, equal to all the powers of forti|tude which can be rai&s;ed again&s;t them, is now univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed; and therefore it is u&s;eful to con&s;ider not only how we may e&s;cape them, but by what means tho&s;e which either the ac|cidents of affairs, or the infirmities of nature mu&s;t bring upon us, may be mitigated and lightened; and how we may make tho&s;e hours le&s;s wretched, which the condition of our pre|&s;ent exi&s;tence will not allow to be very happy.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278">
THE cure for the greate&s;t part of human mi&s;eries is not radical, but palliative. Infeli|city is involved in corporeal nature, and inter|woven with our being; all attempts therefore to decline it wholly are u&s;ele&s;s and vain: the ar|mies of pain &s;end their arrows again&s;t us on every &s;ide, the choice is only between tho&s;e which are more or le&s;s &s;harp, or tinged with poi&s;on of greater or le&s;s malignity; and the &s;tronge&s;t armour which rea&s;on can &s;upply, will only blunt their points, but cannot re|pel them.</P>
<P>THE great remedy which heaven has put in our hands is patience, by which, though we cannot le&s;&s;en the torments of the body, we can in a great mea&s;ure pre&s;erve the peace of the mind, and &s;hall &s;uffer only the natural and genuine force of an evil, without heightening its acrimony, or prolonging its effects.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed nothing more un&s;uitable to the nature of man in any calamity than rage and turbulence, which, without examin|ing whether they are not &s;ometimes impious, are at lea&s;t always offen&s;ive, and incline others rather to hate and de&s;pi&s;e than to pity and a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="278" REF="279">
us. If what we &s;uffer has been brought upon us by our&s;elves, it is ob&s;erved by an antient poet, that patience is eminently our duty, &s;ince no one &s;hould be angry at feeling that which he has de&s;erved. <Q>Leniter ex merito quicquid patiare feren|dum e&s;t.</Q> And, &s;urely, if we are not con&s;cious that we have contributed to our own &s;ufferings, if puni&s;hment fall upon innocence, or di&s;appoint|ment happens to indu&s;try and prudence, pa|tience, whether more nece&s;&s;ary or not, is much ea&s;ier, &s;ince our pain is then without aggrava|tion, and we have not the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e to add to the a&s;perity of misfortune.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e evils which are allotted to us by providence, &s;uch as deformity, privation of any of the &s;en&s;es, or old age, it is always to be remembred that impatience can have no pre&s;ent effect, but to deprive us of the con&s;o|lations which our condition admits, by driving away from us tho&s;e by who&s;e conver&s;ation or advice we might be amu&s;ed or helped; and that with regard to futurity it is yet le&s;s to be ju&s;tified, &s;ince, without le&s;&s;ening the pain, it cuts off the hope of that reward, which he by
<PB N="279" REF="280">
whom it is inflicted will confer upon them that bear it well.</P>
<P>IN all evils which admit a remedy, impati|ence is to be avoided, becau&s;e it wa&s;tes that time and attention in complaints, that, if pro|perly applied, might remove the cau&s;e. Tu|renne, among the acknowledgements which he u&s;ed to pay in conver&s;ation to the memory of tho&s;e by whom he had been in&s;tructed in the art of war, mentioned one with honour, who taught him not to &s;pend his time in regretting any mi&s;take which he had made, but to &s;et him&s;elf immediately and vigorou&s;ly to repair it.</P>
<P>PATIENCE and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion are very careful|ly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from cowardice and in|dolence. We are not to repine, but we may lawfully &s;truggle; for the calamities of life, like the nece&s;&s;ities of nature, are calls to la|bour, and exerci&s;es of diligence. When we feel any pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s, we are not to con|clude that we can only obey the will of heaven by langui&s;hing under it, any more than when we perceive the pain of thir&s;t we are to ima|gine that water is prohibited. Of misfortune it never can be certainly known whether, as proceeding from the hand of GOD, it is an act
<PB N="280" REF="281">
of favour, or of puni&s;hment: but &s;ince all the ordinary di&s;pen&s;ations of providence are to be interpreted according to the general ana|logy of things, we may conclude, that we have a right to remove one inconvenience as well as another; that we are only to take care le&s;t we purcha&s;e ea&s;e with guilt; and that our maker's purpo&s;e, whether of reward or &s;everi|ty, will be an&s;wered by the labours which he lays us under the nece&s;&s;ity of performing.</P>
<P>THIS duty is not more difficult in any &s;tate, than in di&s;ea&s;es inten&s;ely painful, which may indeed admit of &s;uch exacerbations as &s;eem to &s;train the powers of life to their ut|mo&s;t &s;tretch, and leave very little of the atten|tion vacant to precept or reproof. In this &s;tate the nature of man requires &s;ome indul|gence, and every extravagance but impiety may be ea&s;ily forgiven him. Yet, le&s;t we &s;hould think our&s;elves too &s;oon entitled to the mournful privileges of irre&s;i&s;tible mi&s;ery, it is proper to reflect that the utmo&s;t angui&s;h which human wit can contrive, or human malice can inflict, has been born with con&s;tan|cy; and that if the pains of di&s;ea&s;e be, as I believe they are, &s;ometimes greater than tho&s;e of artificial torture, they are therefore in their
<PB N="281" REF="282">
own nature &s;horter, the vital frame is quickly broken, the union between &s;oul and body is for a time &s;u&s;pended, and we &s;oon cea&s;e to feel our maladies when they once become too vio|lent to be born. I think there is &s;ome rea&s;on for que&s;tioning whether the body and mind are not &s;o proportioned, that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other, whe|ther virtue cannot &s;tand its ground as long as life, and whether a &s;oul well principled will not be &s;eparated &s;ooner than &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>In calamities which operate chiefly on our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as diminution of fortune, lo&s;s of friends, or declen&s;ion of character, the chief danger of impatience is upon the fir&s;t at|tack, and many expedients have been contri|ved, by which the blow may be broken. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t general precept is, not to take plea&s;ure in any thing, of which it is not in our power to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to our&s;elves.&mdash;This coun&s;el, when we con&s;ider the enjoy|ment of any terre&s;trial advantage, as oppo&s;ite to a con&s;tant and habitual &s;olicitude for future felicity, is undoubtedly ju&s;t, and delivered by that authority which cannot be di&s;puted; but in any other &s;en&s;e, is it not like advice, not to walk le&s;t we &s;hould &s;tumble, or not to &s;ee
<PB N="282" REF="283">
le&s;t our eyes &s;hould light upon deformity? It &s;eems to me rea&s;onable to enjoy ble&s;&s;ings with confidence, as well as to lo&s;e them with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and to hope for the continuance of good which we po&s;&s;e&s;s without in&s;olence or voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, as for the re&s;titution of that which we lo&s;e without de&s;pondency or mur|murs.</P>
<P>The chief &s;ecurity again&s;t the fruitle&s;s an|gui&s;h of impatience, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the fre|quent reflection on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the GOD of nature, in who&s;e hands are riches and poverty, honour and di&s;grace, plea|&s;ure and pain, and life and death. A &s;ettled conviction of the tendency of every thing to our good, and of the po&s;&s;ibility of turning mi&s;eries into happine&s;s, by receiving them rightly, will incline us to ble&s;s the name of the Lord, whether he gives or takes away.</P>

<P>IN the early ages of the world, as is well known to tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in anti|ent traditions, when innocence was yet un|tainted, and &s;implicity unadulterated, man|kind was happy in the enjoyment of continual plea&s;ure, and con&s;tant plenty, under the pro|tection of REST; a gentle divinity, who requi|red of her wor&s;hippers neither altars nor &s;a|crifices, and who&s;e rites were only performed by pro&s;trations upon tufts of flowers in &s;hades of ja&s;mine and myrtle, or by dances on the banks of rivers flowing with milk and nectar.</P>
<P>UNDER this ea&s;y government the fir&s;t ge|nerations breathed the fragrance of perpetual &s;pring, eat the fruits, which, without culture, fell ripe into their hands, and &s;lept under bowers arched by nature, with the birds &s;ing|ing over their heads, and the bea&s;ts &s;porting about them. But by degrees they began to lo&s;e their original integrity; each, though
<PB N="284" REF="285">
there was more than enough for all, was de|&s;irous of appropriating part to him&s;elf. Then entered violence and fraud, and theft and ra|pine. Soon after pride and envy broke into the world, and brought with them a new &s;tandard of wealth; for men, who till then thought them&s;elves rich when they wanted no|thing, now rated their demands, not by the calls of nature, but by the plenty of others; and began to con&s;ider them&s;elves as poor when they beheld their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions exceeded by tho&s;e of their neighbours. Now only one could be happy, becau&s;e only one could have mo&s;t, and that one was always in danger, le&s;t the &s;ame arts by which he had &s;upplanted others &s;hould be practi&s;ed upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AMIDST the prevalence of this corruption, the &s;tate of the earth was changed; the year was divided into &s;ea&s;ons; part of the ground became barren, and the re&s;t yielded only ber|ries, acorns, and herbs. The &s;ummer and autumn indeed furni&s;hed a coar&s;e and inelegant &s;ufficiency, but winter was without any relief; FAMINE, with a thou&s;and di&s;ea&s;es, which the inclemency of the air invited into the upper regions, made havock among men, and there
<PB N="285" REF="286">
appeared to be danger le&s;t they &s;hould be de|&s;troyed before they were reformed.</P>
<P>TO oppo&s;e the deva&s;tations of FAMINE, who &s;cattered the ground every where with carca&s;es, LABOUR came down upon earth. LABOUR was the &s;on of NECESSITY, the nur&s;eling of HOPE, and the pupil of ART; he had the &s;trength of his mother, the &s;pirit of his nur&s;e, and the dexterity of his governe&s;s. His face was wrinkled with the wind, and &s;warthy with the &s;un; he had the implements of hu&s;bandry in one hand, with which he turn|ed up the earth; in the other he had the tools of architecture, and rai&s;ed walls and towers at his plea&s;ure. He called out, with a rough voice, "Mortals! &s;ee here the power to whom you are con&s;igned, and from whom you are to hope for all your plea&s;ures, and all your &s;afety. You have long langui&s;hed un|der the dominion of REST, an impotent and deceitful godde&s;s, who can neither protect nor relieve you, but re&s;igns you to the fir&s;t attacks of either FAMINE or DISEASE, and &s;uffers her &s;hades to be invaded by every enemy, and de&s;troyed by every accident."</P>
<P>"AWAKE therefore to the call of LABOUR.
<PB N="286" REF="287">
I will teach you to remedy the &s;terility of the earth, and the &s;everity of the &s;ky; I will compel &s;ummer to find provi&s;ions for the winter; I will force the waters to give you their fi&s;h, the air its fowls, and the fore&s;t its bea&s;ts; I will teach you to pierce the bowels of the earth, and bring out from the caverns of the mountains metals which &s;hall give &s;trength to your hands, and &s;ecu|rity to your bodies, by which you may be covered from the a&s;&s;aults of the fierce&s;t bea&s;ts, and with which you &s;hall fell the oak, and divide rocks, and &s;ubject all na|ture to your u&s;e and plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this magnificent invita|tion, the inhabitants of the globe con&s;idered LABOUR as their only friend, and ha&s;ted to his command. He led them out to the fields and mountains, and &s;hewed them how to open mines, to level hills, to drain mar&s;h|es, and change the cour&s;e of rivers. The face of things was immediately transformed; the land was covered with towns and villages, encompa&s;&s;ed with fields of corn, and plan|tations of fruit-trees; and nothing was &s;een but heaps of grain, and ba&s;kets of fruit, full tables, and crouded &s;torehou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="288">
THUS LABOUR and his followers added e|very hour new acqui&s;itions to their conque&s;ts, and &s;aw FAMINE gradually di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his dominions; till at la&s;t, amid&s;t their jollity and triumphs, they were depre&s;&s;ed and amazed by the approach of LASSITUDE, who was known by her &s;unk eyes, and dejected countenance. She came forward trembling and groaning: at every groan the hearts of all tho&s;e that be|held her lo&s;t their courage, their nerves &s;lack|ened, their hands &s;hook, and the in&s;truments of labour fell from their gra&s;p.</P>
<P>SHOCKED with this horrid phantom they reflected with regret on their ea&s;y compliance with the &s;olicitations of LABOUR, and began to wi&s;h again for the golden hours which they remembered to have pa&s;&s;ed under the reign of REST, whom they re&s;olved again to vi&s;it, and to whom they intended to dedicate the remaining part of their lives. REST had not left the world; they quickly found her, and to atone for their former de&s;ertion, invited her to the enjoyment of tho&s;e acqui&s;itions which LABOUR had procured them.</P>
<P>REST therefore took leave of the groves and
<PB N="288" REF="289">
vallies, which &s;he had hitherto inhabited, and entered into palaces, repo&s;ed her&s;elf in alcoves, and &s;lumbered away the winter upon beds of down, and the &s;ummer in artificial grottos with ca&s;cades playing before her. There was indeed always &s;omething wanting to complete her felicity, and &s;he could never lull her re|turning fugitives to that &s;erenity, which they knew before their engagements with LABOUR: Nor was her dominion entirely without con|troul, for &s;he was obliged to &s;hare it with LUXURY, though &s;he always looked upon her as a fal&s;e friend, by whom her influence was in reality de&s;troyed, while it &s;eemed to be pro|moted.</P>
<P>THE two &s;oft a&s;&s;ociates, however, reigned for &s;ome time without vi&s;ible di&s;agreement, till at la&s;t LUXURY betrayed her charge, and let in DISEASE to &s;eize upon her wor&s;hippers. REST then flew away, and left the place to the u&s;urpers; who employed all their arts to fortify them&s;elves in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of each other.</P>
<P>REST had not always the &s;ame enemy: in &s;ome places &s;he e&s;caped the incur&s;ions of DIS|EASE; but had her residence invaded by a
<PB N="289" REF="290">
more &s;low and &s;ubtle intruder, for very fre|quently when every thing was compo&s;ed and quiet, when there was neither pain within, nor danger without, when every flower was in bloom, and every gale freighted with perfumes, SATIETY would enter with a langui&s;hing and repining look, and throw her&s;elf upon the couch placed and adorned for the accommo|dation of REST. No &s;ooner was &s;he &s;eated than a general gloom &s;pread it&s;elf on every &s;ide, the groves immediately lo&s;t their verdure, and their inhabitants de&s;i&s;ted from their melody, the breeze &s;unk in &s;ighs, and the flowers con|tracted their leaves and &s;hut up their odours. Nothing was &s;een on every &s;ide but multitudes wandering about they knew not whither, in que&s;t they knew not of what; no voice was heard but of complaints that mentioned no pain, and murmurs that could tell of no mi&s;|fortune.</P>
<P>REST had now lo&s;t her authority. Her followers again began to treat her with con|tempt; &s;ome of them united them&s;elves more clo&s;ely to LUXURY, who promi&s;ed by her arts to drive SATIETY away, and others, that were more wi&s;e or had more fortitude, went back again to LABOUR, by whom they were
<PB N="290" REF="291">
indeed protected from SATIETY, but deli|vered up in time to LASSITUDE, and forced by her to the bowers of REST.</P>
<P>THUS REST and LABOUR equally perceiv|ed their reign of &s;hort duration and uncertain tenure, and their empire liable to inrodes from tho&s;e who were alike enemies to both. They each &s;ound their &s;ubjects unfaithful, and ready to de&s;ert them upon every opportunity. LABOUR &s;aw the riches which he had given always carried away as an offering to REST, and REST found her votaries in every exigence flying from her to beg help of LABOUR. They, therefore, at la&s;t determined upon an interview, in which they agreed to divide the world between them, and govern it alternate|ly, allotting the dominion of the day to one, and that of the night to the other, and pro|mi&s;ed to guard the frontiers of each other, &s;o that, whenever ho&s;tilities were attempted, SATIETY &s;hould be intercepted by LABOUR, and LASSITUDE expelled by REST. Thus the antient quarrel was appea&s;ed, and as ha|tred is often &s;ucceeded by its contrary, REST afterwards became pregnant by LABOUR, and was delivered of HEALTH, a benevolent godde&s;s, who con&s;olidated the union of her
<PB N="291" REF="292">
parents, and contributed to the regular vici&s;&s;i|tudes of their reign, by di&s;pen&s;ing her gifts to tho&s;e only who &s;hared their lives in ju&s;t propor|tions between REST and LABOUR.</P>

<P>I HAVE been cen&s;ured for having hitherto de|dicated &s;o few of my &s;peculations to the la|dies; and indeed the morali&s;t, who&s;e in&s;tructi|ons are accommodated only to one half of the human &s;pecies, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed not &s;uffici|ently to have extended his views.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a young gentleman at my own di&s;po&s;al, with a con&s;iderablee&s;tate; and having pa&s;|&s;ed through the common forms of education, &s;pent &s;ome time in foreign countries, and made my&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ince my return in the polite&s;t company, I am now arrived at that part of life in which every man is expected to &s;ettle, and provide for the continuation of his lineage. I with&s;tood for &s;ome time the &s;olicitations and remon&s;trances of my aunts
<PB N="293" REF="294">
and uncles, but at la&s;t was per&s;uaded to vi&s;it <HI>Anthea,</HI> an heire&s;s, who&s;e land lies contiguous to mine, and who&s;e birth and beauty are without objection. Our friends declared that we were born for each other, all tho&s;e on both &s;ides who had no intere&s;t in hindering our union, contributed to promote it, and were con&s;pir|ing to hurry us into matrimony, before we had any opportunity of knowing one another. I was, however, too old to be given away without my own con&s;ent, and having happen|ed to pick up an opinion, which to many of my relations &s;eemed extremely odd, that a man might be unhappy with a large e&s;tate, determined to obtain a nearer knowledge of the per&s;on with whom I was to pa&s;s the remain|der of my time. To protract the court|&s;hip was by no means difficult, for <HI>Anthea</HI> had a wonderful facility of evading que&s;tions which I &s;eldom repeated, and of barring ap|proaches which I had no great eagerne&s;s to pre&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS the time pa&s;&s;ed away in vi&s;its and civilities, without any ardent profe&s;&s;ions of love, or formal offers of &s;ettlements. I often attended her to publick places, in which, as is well known, all behaviour is &s;o much regulated
<PB N="294" REF="295">
by cu&s;tom, that very little in&s;ight can be gain|ed into the private character, and therefore I was not yet able to inform my&s;elf of her hu|mour and inclinations.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t I ventured to propo&s;e to her to make one of a &s;mall party, and &s;pend a day in viewing a &s;eat and gardens a few miles di&s;|tant; and having, upon her compliance, col|lected the re&s;t of the company, I brought, at the hour, a coach which I had borrowed from an acquaintance, having delayed to buy one my|&s;elf, till I &s;hould have an opportunity of ta|king the lady's opinion for who&s;e u&s;e it was intended. <HI>Anthea</HI> came down, but as &s;he was going to &s;tep into the coach, &s;tarted back with great appearance of terror, and told us that &s;he dur&s;t not enter, for the &s;hocking colour of the lining had &s;o much the air of the mourn|ing coach, in which &s;he followed her aunt's funeral three years before, that &s;he &s;hould ne|ver have her poor dear aunt out of her head.</P>
<P>I KNEW that it was not for lovers to argue with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; I therefore &s;ent back the coach, and got another more gay. Into this we all entered, the coachman began to drive, and we were amu&s;ing our&s;elves with the
<PB N="295" REF="296">
expectation of what we &s;hould &s;ee, when, upon a &s;mall inclination of the carriage, <HI>An|thea</HI> &s;creamed out, that we were overthrown. We were obliged to fix all our attention upon her, which &s;he took care to keep up by renew|ing her outcries, at every corner where we had occa&s;ion to turn: at intervals &s;he entertained us with fretful complaints of the unea&s;ine&s;s of the coach, and obliged me to call &s;everal times on the coachman to take care and drive without jolting. The poor fellow endeavour|ed to plea&s;e us, and therefore moved very &s;lowly, 'till <HI>Anthea</HI> found out that this pace would only keep us longer on the &s;tones, and de&s;ired that I would order him to make more &s;peed. He whipped his hor&s;es, the coach jolted again, and <HI>Anthea</HI> very complai&s;antly told us how much &s;he repented that &s;he made one of our company.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t we got into the &s;mooth road, and began to think our difficulties at an end, when, on a &s;udden, <HI>Anthea</HI> &s;aw a brook before us, which &s;he could not venture to pa&s;s. We were, therefore, obliged to alight, that we might walk over the bridge; but when we came to it, we found it &s;o narrow, that <HI>An|thea</HI> dur&s;t not &s;et her foot upon it, and was
<PB N="296" REF="297">
content, after long con&s;ultation, to call the coach back, and with innumerable precauti|ons, terrors, and lamentations, cro&s;&s;ed the brook.</P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary, after this delay, to mend our pace, and directions were accordingly given to the coachman, when <HI>Anthea</HI> informed us, that it was common for the axle to catch fire with a quick motion, and begged of me to look out every minute, le&s;t we &s;hould all be con&s;umed. I was forced to obey, and give her from time to time the mo&s;t &s;olemn declara|tions that all was &s;afe, and that I hoped we &s;hould reach the place without lo&s;ing our lives either by fire or water.</P>
<P>THUS we pa&s;&s;ed on, over ways &s;oft and hard, with more or with le&s;s &s;peed, but al|ways with new vici&s;&s;itudes of anxiety. If the ground was hard, we were jolted, if &s;oft, we were &s;inking. If we went fa&s;t, we &s;hould be overturned, if &s;lowly, we &s;hould never reach the place. At length &s;he &s;aw &s;omething which &s;he called a cloud, and began to con&s;i|der that at that time of the year it frequently thundered. This &s;eemed to be the capital ter|rour, for after that the coach was &s;uffered to
<PB N="297" REF="298">
move on; and no danger was thought too dreadful to be encountered, provided &s;he could get into a hou&s;e before the thunder.</P>
<P>THUS our whole conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in dangers, and cares, and fears, and con&s;olati|ons, and &s;tories of ladies dragged in the mire, forced to &s;pend all the night on a heath, drowned in rivers, or burnt with lightening; and no &s;ooner had a hairbreadth e&s;cape &s;et us free from one calamity, but we were threat|ened with another.</P>
<P>AT length we reached the hou&s;e where we intended to regale our&s;elves, and I propo&s;ed to Anthea the choice of a great number of di&s;hes, which the place, being well provided for entertainment, happened to afford. She made &s;ome objection to every thing that was offered; one thing &s;he hated at that time of the year, another &s;he could not bear &s;ince &s;he had &s;een it &s;poiled at lady Feedwell's table; another &s;he was &s;ure they could not dre&s;s at this hou&s;e, and another &s;he could not touch without French &s;auce. At la&s;t &s;he fixed her mind upon &s;almon, but there was no &s;almon in the hou&s;e. It was however procured with great expedition, and when it came to the ta|ble,
<PB N="298" REF="299">
&s;he found that her fright had taken away her &s;tomach, which indeed &s;he thought no great lo&s;s, for &s;he could never believe that any thing at an inn could be cleanly got.</P>
<P>DINNER was now over, and the company propo&s;ed, for I was now pa&s;t the condition of making overtures, that we &s;hould per&s;ue our original de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the gardens. <HI>Anthea</HI> declared that &s;he could not imagine what plea&s;ure we expected from the &s;ight of a few green trees and a little gravel, and two or three pits of clear water; that for her part &s;he hated walking till the cool of the evening, and thought it very likely to rain, and again wi&s;hed that &s;he had &s;taid at home. We then reconciled our&s;elves to our di&s;ap|pointment, and began to talk on common &s;ubjects, when <HI>Anthea</HI> told us that &s;ince we came to &s;ee gardens, &s;he would not hinder our &s;atisfaction. We all ro&s;e and walked through the enclo&s;ures for &s;ome time, with no other trouble than the nece&s;&s;ity of watching le&s;t a frog &s;hould hop acro&s;s the way, which <HI>Anthea</HI> told us would certainly kill her, if &s;he &s;hould happen to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>FROGS, as it fell out, there were none, but

when we were within an acre of the gardens, <HI>Anthea</HI> &s;aw &s;ome &s;heep, and heard the wether clink his bell, which &s;he was certain was not hung upon him for nothing, and therefore no a&s;&s;urances nor intreaties &s;hould prevail upon her to go a &s;tep farther; &s;he was &s;orry to di&s;|appoint the company, but her life was dearer to her than ceremony.</P>
<P>WE came back to the inn, and <HI>Anthea</HI> now di&s;covered that there was no time to be lo&s;t in returning, for the night would come upon us, and a thou&s;and misfortunes might happen in the dark. The hor&s;es were immediately har|ne&s;&s;ed, and <HI>Anthea</HI> having wondered what could &s;educe her to &s;tay &s;o long was eager to &s;et out. But we had now a new &s;cene of ter|rour, every man we &s;aw was a robber, and we were ordered &s;ometimes to drive hard le&s;t a traveller whom we &s;aw behind &s;hould over|take us, and &s;ometimes to &s;top, le&s;t we &s;hould come up to him who was pa&s;&s;ing before us. She alarmed many an hone&s;t man by begging him to &s;pare her life as he pa&s;&s;ed by the coach, and drew me into fifteen quarrels with per&s;ons who encrea&s;ed her fright by kindly &s;topping to enquire whether they could a&s;&s;i&s;t us. At la&s;t

we came home, and &s;he told hercompany next day what a plea&s;ant ride &s;he had been taking.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE, Sir, I need not enquire of you what deductions may be made from this nar|rative, nor what happine&s;s can ari&s;e from the &s;ociety of that woman, who mi&s;takes cowar|dice for elegance, and imagines all delicacy to con&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to be plea&s;ed.</P>
