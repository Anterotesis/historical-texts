<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ay owes its origin to a conver&s;ation with a friend, on the &s;ubject of Mr. Godwin's E&s;&s;ay, on ava|rice and profu&s;ion, in his Enquirer. The di&s;cu&s;sion, &s;tarted the general que&s;tion of the future improvement of &s;ociety; and the Author at fir&s;t &s;at down with an intention of merely &s;tating his thoughts to his friend, upon paper, in a clearer manner than he thought he could do, in conver&s;ation. But as the &s;ubject opened upon him, &s;ome ideas occurred, which he did not recollect to have met with before; and as he conceived, that every, the lea&s;t light, on a topic &s;o generally intere&s;ting, might be received with can|dour, he determined to put his thoughts in a form for publication.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">
The e&s;&s;ay might, undoubtedly, have been rendered much more complete by a collection of a greater number of facts in elucidation of the general argument. But a long and almo&s;t total interrup|tion, from very particular bu&s;ine&s;s, joined to a de&s;ire (perhaps imprudent) of not delaying the publication much beyond the time that he originally propo&s;ed, prevented the Author from giving to the &s;ubject an undivided attention. He pre&s;umes, however, that the facts which he has adduced, will be found, to form no incon&s;iderable evidence for the truth of his opinion re&s;pecting the future im|provement of mankind. As the Author contemplates this opinion at pre&s;ent, little more appears to him to be nece&s;|&s;ary than a plain &s;tatement, in addition to the mo&s;t cur&s;ory view of &s;ociety, to e&s;tabli&s;h it.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">
It is an obvious truth, which has been taken notice of by many writers, that population mu&s;t always be kept down to the level of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but no writer, that the Author recollects, has inquired particularly into the means by which this level is effected: and it is a view of the&s;e means, which forms, to his mind, the &s;tronge&s;t ob|&s;tacle in the way to any very great fu|ture improvement of &s;ociety. He hopes it will appear; that, in the di&s;cu&s;sion of this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, he is actuated &s;olely by a love of truth; and not by any prejudices again&s;t any particular &s;et of men, or of opinions. He profe&s;&s;es to have read &s;ome of the &s;peculations on the future improvement of &s;ociety, in a temper very different from a wi&s;h to find them vi&s;ionary; but he has not acquired that command over his under&s;tanding which would enable him to believe what
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
he wi&s;hes, without evidence, or to refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to what might be unplea&s;ing, when accompanied with evidence.</P>
<P>The view which he has given of human life has a melancholy hue; but he feels con&s;cious, that he has drawn the&s;e dark tints, from a conviction that they are really in the picture; and not from a jaundiced eye, or an inherent &s;pleen of di&s;po&s;ition. The theory of mind which he has &s;ketched in the two la&s;t chapters, accounts to his own under&s;tanding, in a &s;atisfactory manner, for the exi&s;tence of mo&s;t of the evils of life; but whether it will have the &s;ame effect upon others, mu&s;t be left to the judgment of his readers.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould &s;ucceed in drawing the attention of more able men, to what he conceives to be the principal difficulty in
<PB N="v" REF="6">
the way to the improvement of &s;ociety, and &s;hould, in con&s;equence, &s;ee this dif|ficulty removed, even in theory, he will gladly retract his pre&s;ent opinions, and rejoice in a conviction of his error.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE <HI>PRINCIPLE OF POPULATION.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Que&s;tion &s;tated.&mdash;Little pro&s;pect of a determination of it, from the enmity of the oppo&s;ing parties.&mdash;The prin|cipal argument again&s;t the perfectibility of man and of &s;ociety has never been fairly an&s;wered.&mdash;Nature of the difficulty ari&s;ing from population.&mdash;Outline of the principal argument of the e&s;&s;ay.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE great and unlooked for di&s;coveries that have taken place of late years in natural philo&s;ophy; the increa&s;ing dif|fu&s;ion of general knowledge from the ex|ten&s;ion of the art of printing; the ardent and un&s;hackled &s;pirit of inquiry that pre|vails throughout the lettered, and even un|lettered world; the new and extraordinary
<PB N="2" REF="18">
lights that have been thrown on political &s;ubjects, which dazzle, and a&s;toni&s;h the under&s;tanding; and particularly that tre|mendous phenomenon in the political horizon the French revolution, which, like a blazing comet, feems de&s;tined either to in&s;pire with fre&s;h life and vigour, or to &s;corch up and de&s;troy the &s;hrinking in|habitants of the earth, have all concurred to lead many able men into the opinion, that we were touching on a period big with the mo&s;t important changes, changes that would in &s;ome mea&s;ure be deci&s;ive of the future fate of mankind.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the great que&s;tion is now at i&s;&s;ue, whether man &s;hall hence|forth &s;tart forwards with accelerated ve|locity towards illimitable, and hitherto unconceived improvement; or be con|demned to a perpetual o&s;cillation between happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, and after every
<PB N="3" REF="19">
effort remain &s;till at an immea&s;urable di&s;tance from the wi&s;hed-for goal.</P>
<P>Yet, anxiou&s;ly as every friend of man|kind mu&s;t look forwards to the termina|tion of this painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and, eagerly as the inquiring mind would hail every ray of light that might a&s;si&s;t its view into futurity, it is much to be lamented, that the writers on each &s;ide of this momentous que&s;tion &s;till keep far aloof from each other. Their mutual arguments do not meet with a candid examination. The que&s;tion is not brought to re&s;t on fewer points; and even in theory &s;carcely &s;eems to be approaching to a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The advocate for the pre&s;ent order of things, is apt to treat the &s;ect of &s;pe|culative philo&s;phers, either as a &s;et of artful and de&s;igning knaves, who preach up ardent benevolence, and draw capti|vating
<PB N="4" REF="20">
pictures of a happier &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, only the better to enable them to de&s;troy the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to forward their own deep-laid &s;chemes of ambition: or, as wild and mad-headed enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who&s;e &s;illy &s;peculations, and ab&s;urd paradoxes, are not worthy the at|tention of any rea&s;onable man.</P>
<P>The advocate for the perfectibility of man, and of &s;ociety, retorts on the de|fender of e&s;tabli&s;hments a more than equal contempt. He brands him as the &s;lave of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, and narrow prejudices; or, as the defender of the abu&s;es of civil &s;ociety, only becau&s;e he profits by them. He paints him either as a character who pro&s;titutes his under|&s;tanding to his intere&s;t; or as one who&s;e powers of mind are not of a &s;ize to gra&s;p any thing great and noble; who cannot &s;ee above five yards before him; and who
<PB N="5" REF="21">
mu&s;t therefore be utterly unable to take in the views of the enlightened benefactor of mankind.</P>
<P>In this unamicable conte&s;t, the cau&s;e of truth cannot but &s;uffer. The really good arguments on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion are not allowed to have their proper weight. Each pur&s;ues his own theory, little &s;oli|citous to correct, or improve it, by an at|tention to what is advanced by his op|ponents.</P>
<P>The friend of the pre&s;ent order of things condemns all political &s;peculations in the gro&s;s. He will not even conde&s;cend to examine the grounds from which the perfectibility of &s;ociety is inferred. Much le&s;s will he give him&s;elf the trouble in a fair and candid manner to attempt an expo&s;ition of their fallacy.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="22">
The &s;peculative philo&s;opher equally offends again&s;t the cau&s;e of truth. With eyes fixed on a happier &s;tate of &s;ociety, the ble&s;sings of which he paints in the mo&s;t captivating colours, he allows him|&s;elf to indulge in the mo&s;t bitter in|vectives again&s;t every pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, without applying his talents to con|&s;ider the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t means of removing abu&s;es, and without &s;eeming to be aware of the tremendous ob&s;tacles that threaten, even in theory, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of man towards perfection.</P>
<P>It is an acknowledged truth in philo|&s;ophy, that a ju&s;t theory will always be confirmed by experiment. Yet &s;o much friction, and &s;o many minute circum|&s;tances occur in practice, which it is next to impo&s;sible for the mo&s;t enlarged and penetrating mind to fore&s;ee, that on few &s;ubjects can any theory be pronounced
<PB N="7" REF="23">
ju&s;t, that has not &s;tood the te&s;t of ex|perience. But an untried theory cannot fairly be advanced as probable, much le&s;s as ju&s;t, till all the arguments again&s;t it, have been maturely weighed, and clearly and con&s;i&s;tently re&s;uted.</P>
<P>I have read &s;ome of the &s;peculations on the perfectibility of man and of &s;ociety, with great plea&s;ure. I have been warmed and delighted with the enchanting pic+ture which they hold forth. I ardently wi&s;h for &s;uch happy improvements. But I &s;ee great, and, to my under&s;tanding, unconquerable difficulties in the way to them. The&s;e difficulties it is my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to &s;tate; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that &s;o far from exulting in them, as a cau&s;e of triumph over the friends of innovation, nothing would give me greater plea&s;ure than to &s;ee them completely re|moved.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="24">
The mo&s;t important argument that I &s;hall adduce is certainly not new. The principles on which it depends have been explained in part by Hume, and more at large by Dr. Adam Smith. It has been advanced and applied to the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, though not with its proper weight, or in the mo&s;t forcible point of view, by Mr. Wallace: and it may probably have been &s;tated by many writers that I have never met with. I &s;hould certainly therefore not think of advancing it again, though I mean to place it in a point of view in &s;ome degree different from any that I have hitherto &s;een, if it had ever been fairly and &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this neglect on the part of the advocates for the perfectibility of man|kind, is not ea&s;ily accounted for. I cannot doubt the talents of &s;uch men as Godwin and Condorcet. I am unwilling to doubt their
<PB N="9" REF="25">
candour. To my under&s;tanding, and pro|bably to that of mo&s;t others, the difficulty appears in&s;urmountable. Yet the&s;e men of acknowledged ability and penetration, &s;carcely deign to notice it, and hold on their cour&s;e in &s;uch &s;peculations, with unabated ardour, and undimini&s;hed con|fidence. I have certainly no right to &s;ay that they purpo&s;ely &s;hut their eyes to &s;uch arguments. I ought rather to doubt the validity of them, when neglected by &s;uch men, however forcibly their truth may &s;trike my own mind. Yet in this re&s;pect it mu&s;t be acknowledged that we are all of us too prone to err. If I &s;aw a gla&s;s of wine repeatedly pre&s;ented to a man, and he took no notice of it, I &s;hould be apt to think that he was blind or uncivil. A ju&s;ter philo&s;ophy might teach me rather to think that my eyes deceived me, and that the offer was not really what I con|ceived it to be.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="26">
In entering upon the argument I mu&s;t premi&s;e that I put out of the que&s;tion, at pre&s;ent, all mere conjectures; that is, all &s;uppo&s;itions, the probable realization of which cannot be inferred upon any ju&s;t philo&s;ophical grounds. A writer may tell me that he thinks man will ultimately be|come an o&s;trich. I cannot properly con|tradict him. But before he can expect to bring any rea&s;onable per&s;on over to his opinion, he ought to &s;hew, that the neeks of mankind have been gradually elon|gating; that the lips have grown harder, and more prominent; that the legs and feet are daily altering their &s;hape; and that the hair is beginning to change into &s;tubs of feathers. And till the probability of &s;o wonderful a conver&s;ion can be &s;hewn, it is &s;urely lo&s;t time and lo&s;t eloquence to expatiate on the happine&s;s of man in &s;uch a &s;tate; to de&s;cribe his powers, both of running and flying; to paint him in
<PB N="11" REF="27">
a condition where all narrow luxuries would be contemned; where he would be employed only in collecting the nece&s;|&s;aries of life; and where, con&s;equently, each man's &s;hare of labour would be light, and his portion of lei&s;ure ample.</P>
<P>I think I may fairly make two po&s;tu|lata.</P>

<P>Secondly, That the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes is nece&s;&s;ary, and will remain nearly in its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e two laws ever &s;ince we have had any knowledge of mankind, appear to have been fixed laws of our nature; and, as we have not hitherto &s;een any alteration in them, we have no right
<PB N="12" REF="28">
to conclude that they will ever cea&s;e to be what they now are, without an immediate act of power in that Being who fir&s;t arranged the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; and for the advantage of his creatures, &s;till executes, according to fixed laws, all its various operations.</P>
<P>I do not know that any writer has &s;uppo&s;ed that on this earth man will ultimately be able to live without food. But Mr. Godwin has conjectured that the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes may in time be extingui&s;hed. As, however, he calls this part of his work, a deviation into the land of conjecture, I will not dwell longer upon it at pre&s;ent, than to &s;ay, that the be&s;t arguments for the perfectibility of man, are drawn from a contemplation of the great progre&s;s that he has already made from the &s;avage &s;tate, and the difficulty of &s;aying where
<PB N="13" REF="29">
he is to &s;top. But towards the extinc|tion of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes, no progre&s;s whatever has hitherto been made. It appears to exi&s;t in as much force at pre&s;ent as it did two thou&s;and, or four thou&s;and years ago. There are individual exceptions now as there al|ways have been. But, as the&s;e excep|tions do not appear to increa&s;e in num|ber, it would &s;urely be a very unphi|lo&s;ophical mode of arguing, to infer merely from the exi&s;tence of an excep|tion, that the exception would, in time, become the rule, and the rule the ex|ception.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming then, my po&s;tulata as granted, I &s;ay, that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for man.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="30">
Population, when unchecked, increa&s;es in a geometrical ratio. Sub&s;i&s;tence in|crea&s;es only in an arithmetical ratio. A &s;light acquaintance with numbers will &s;hew the immen&s;ity of the fir&s;t power in compari&s;on of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>By that law of our nature which makes food nece&s;&s;ary to the life of man, the effects of the&s;e two unequal powers mu&s;t be kept equal.</P>
<P>This implies a &s;trong and con&s;tantly operating check on population from the difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This difficulty mu&s;t fall &s;ome where; and mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be &s;everely felt by a large portion of mankind.</P>
<P>Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has &s;cattered the &s;eeds
<PB N="15" REF="31">
of life abroad with the mo&s;t profu&s;e and liberal hand. She has been com|paratively &s;paring in the room, and the nouri&s;hment nece&s;&s;ary to rear them. The germs of exi&s;tence contained in this &s;pot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the cour&s;e of a few thou&s;and years. Nece&s;sity, that impe|rious all pervading law of nature, re&s;|trains them within the pre&s;cribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals &s;hrink under this great re&s;tric|tive law. And the race of man can|not, by any efforts of rea&s;on, e&s;cape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are wa&s;te of &s;eed, &s;ickne&s;s, and premature death. Among mankind, mi&s;ery and vice. The former, mi&s;ery, is an ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of it. Vice is a highly probable con|&s;equence, and we therefore &s;ee it abun|dantly
<PB N="16" REF="32">
prevail; but it ought not, per|haps, to be called an ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence. The ordeal of virtue is to re&s;i&s;t all temptation to evil.</P>
<P>This natural inequality of the two powers of population, and of production in the earth, and that great law of our nature which mu&s;t con&s;tantly keep their effects equal, form the great difficulty that to me appears in&s;urmountable in the way to the perfectibility of &s;ociety. All other arguments are of &s;light and &s;ubordinate con&s;ideration in compari&s;on of this. I &s;ee no way by which man can e&s;|cape from the weight of this law which pervades all animated nature. No fan|cied equality, no agrarian regulations in their utmo&s;t extent, could remove the pre&s;&s;ure of it even for a &s;ingle cen|tury. And it appears, therefore, to be deci&s;ive again&s;t the po&s;sible exi&s;tence of
<PB N="17" REF="33">
a &s;ociety, all the members of which, &s;hould live in ea&s;e, happine&s;s, and comparative lei&s;ure; and feel no anxiety about providing the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence for them&s;elves and families.</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, if the premi&s;es are ju&s;t, the argument is conclu&s;ive again&s;t the perfectibility of the ma&s;s of man|kind.</P>
<P>I have thus &s;ketched the general out|line of the argument; but I will ex|amine it more particularly; and I think it will be found that experience, the true &s;ource and foundation of all know|ledge, invariably confirms its truth.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I SAID that population, when un|checked, increa&s;ed in a geometrical ratio; and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for man in an arithmetical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us examine whether this po&s;i|tion be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I think it will be allowed, that no &s;tate has hitherto exi&s;ted (at lea&s;t that we have any account of) where the
<PB N="19" REF="35">
manners were &s;o pure and &s;imple, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;o abundant, that no check whatever has exi&s;ted to early marriages; among the lower cla&s;&s;es, from a fear of not providing well for their families; or among the higher cla&s;&s;es, from a fear of lowering their con|dition in life. Con&s;equently in no &s;tate that we have yet known, has the power of population been left to exert it&s;elf with perfect freedom.</P>
<P>Whether the law of marriage be in|&s;tituted, or not, the dictate of nature and virtue, &s;eems to be an early attach|ment to one woman. Suppo&s;ing a liberty of changing in the ca&s;e of an unfortu|nate choice, this liberty would not affect population till it aro&s;e to a height greatly vicious; and we are now &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of a &s;ociety where vice is &s;carcely known.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="36">
In a &s;tate therefore of great equality and virtue, where pure and &s;imple man|ners prevailed, and where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence were &s;o abundant, that no part of the &s;ociety could have any fears about providing amply for a family, the power of population being left to exert it&s;elf unchecked, the increa&s;e of the human &s;pecies would evidently be much greater than any increa&s;e that has been hitherto known.</P>
<P>In the United States of America, where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence have been more ample, the manners of the people more pure, and con&s;equently the checks to early marriages fewer, than in any of the modern &s;tates of Europe, the population has been found to double it&s;elf in twenty-five years.</P>
<P>This ratio of increa&s;e, though &s;hort of the utmo&s;t power of population, yet
<PB N="21" REF="37">
as the re&s;ult of actual experience, we will take as our rule; and &s;ay,</P>
<P>That population, when unchecked, goes on doubling it&s;elf every twenty-five years, or increa&s;es in a geometrical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us now take any &s;pot of earth, this I&s;land for in&s;tance, and &s;ee in what ratio the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence it affords can be &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e. We will begin with it under its pre&s;ent &s;tate of culti|vation.</P>
<P>If I allow that by the be&s;t po&s;sible policy, by breaking up more land, and by great encouragements to agriculture, the produce of this I&s;land may be doubled in the fir&s;t twenty-five years, I think it will be allowing as much as any per&s;on can well demand.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="38">
In the next twenty-five years, it is impo&s;sible to &s;uppo&s;e that the produce could be quadrupled. It would be contrary to all our knowledge of the qualities of land. The very utmo&s;t that we can conceive, is, that the increa&s;e in the &s;econd twenty-five years might equal the pre&s;ent produce. Let us then take this for our rule, though certainly far beyond the truth; and allow that by great exertion, the whole produce of the I&s;land might be increa&s;ed every twenty-five years, by a quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence equal to what it at pre&s;ent produces. The mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;peculator cannot &s;uppo&s;e a greater increa&s;e than this. In a few centuries it would make every acre of land in the I&s;land like a garden.</P>
<P>Yet this ratio of increa&s;e is evidently arithmetical.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="39">
It may be fairly &s;aid, therefore, that the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence increa&s;e in an arithmetical ratio.</P>
<P>Let us now bring the effects of the&s;e two ratios together.</P>
<P>The population of the I&s;land is com|puted to be about &s;even millions; and we will &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ent produce equal to the &s;upport of &s;uch a number. In the fir&s;t twenty-five years the popu|lation would be fourteen millions; and the food being al&s;o doubled, the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence would be equal to this increa&s;e. In the next twenty-five years the population would be twenty-eight millions; and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence only equal to the &s;upport of twenty-one millions. In the next period, the popu|lation would be fifty-&s;ix millions, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence ju&s;t &s;ufficient for
<PB N="24" REF="40">
half that number. And at the conclu|&s;ion of the fir&s;t century, the population would be one hundred and twelve mil|lions, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence only equal to the &s;upport of thirty-five mil|lions; which would leave a population of &s;eventy-&s;even millions totally unprovided for.</P>
<P>A great emigration nece&s;&s;arily implies unhappine&s;s of &s;ome kind or other in the country that is de&s;erted. For few per|&s;ons will leave their families, connec|tions, friends, and native land, to &s;eek a &s;ettlement in untried foreign climes, without &s;ome &s;trong &s;ub&s;i&s;ting cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s where they are, or the hope of &s;ome great advantages in the place to which they are going.</P>
<P>But to make the argument more ge|neral, and le&s;s interrupted by the par|tial
<PB N="25" REF="41">
views of emigration, let us take the whole earth, in&s;tead of one &s;pot, and &s;uppo&s;e that the re&s;traints to population were univer&s;ally removed. If the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for man that the earth affords was to be increa&s;ed every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at pre&s;ent produces; this would allow the power of production in the earth to be ab&s;olutely unlimited, and its ratio of increa&s;e much greater than we can conceive that any po&s;sible exer|tions of mankind could make it.</P>
<P>Taking the population of the world at any number, a thou&s;and millions, for in&s;tance, the human &s;pecies would in|crea&s;e in the ratio of&mdash;1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, &amp;c. and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence as&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. In two centuries and a quarter, the population would be to the means of
<PB N="26" REF="42">
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence as 512 to 10: in three cen|turies as 4096 to 13; and in two thou|&s;and years the difference would be almo&s;t incalculable, though the produce in that time would have increa&s;ed to an immen&s;e extent.</P>
<P>No limits whatever are placed to the productions of the earth; they may in|crea&s;e for ever and be greater than any a&s;signable quantity; yet &s;till the power of population being a power of a &s;uperior order, the increa&s;e of the human &s;pecies can only be kept commen&s;urate to the increa&s;e of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by the con&s;tant operation of the &s;trong law of nece&s;sity acting as a check upon the greater power.</P>
<P>The effects of this check remain now to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="43">
Among plants and animals the view of the &s;ubject is &s;imple. They are all im|pelled by a powerful in&s;tinct to the in|crea&s;e of their &s;pecies; and this in&s;tinct is interrupted by no rea&s;oning, or doubts about providing for their offspring. Wherever therefore there is liberty, the power of increa&s;e is exerted; and the &s;uperabundant effects are repre&s;&s;ed after|wards by want of room and nouri&s;hment, which is common to animals and plants; and among animals, by becoming the prey of others.</P>
<P>The effects of this check on man are more complicated.</P>
<P>Impelled to the increa&s;e of his &s;pecies by an equally powerful in&s;tinct, rea&s;on interrupts his career, and a&s;ks him whether he may not bring beings into the world, for whom he cannot provide
<PB N="28" REF="44">
the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In a &s;tate of equality, this would be the &s;imple que&s;|tion. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, other con&s;iderations occur. Will he not lower his rank in life? Will he not &s;ub|ject him&s;elf to greater difficulties than he at pre&s;ent feels? Will he not be obliged to labour harder? and if he has a large family, will his utmo&s;t exertions enable him to &s;upport them? May he not &s;ee his offspring in rags and mi&s;ery, and elamouring for bread that he cannot give them? And may he not be reduced to the grating nece&s;sity of forfeiting his in|dependence, and of being obliged to the &s;paring hand of charity for &s;upport?</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations are calculated to prevent, and certainly do prevent, a very great number in all civilized nations from pur&s;uing the dictate of nature in an early attachment to one woman. And this
<PB N="29" REF="45">
re&s;traint almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, though not ab&s;olutely &s;o, produces vice. Yet in all &s;ocieties, even tho&s;e that are mo&s;t vici|ous, the tendency to a virtuous attach|ment is &s;o &s;trong, that there is a con|&s;tant effort towards an increa&s;e of popu|lation. This con&s;tant effort as con&s;tantly tends to &s;ubject the lower cla&s;&s;es of the &s;ociety to di&s;tre&s;s, and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.</P>
<P>The way in which the&s;e effects are produced &s;eems to be this.</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence in any country ju&s;t equal to the ea&s;y &s;upport of its inhabitants. The con&s;tant effort towards population, which is found to act even in the mo&s;t vicious &s;ocieties, increa&s;es the number of people before the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are in|crea&s;ed.
<PB N="30" REF="46">
The food therefore which be|fore &s;upported &s;even millions, mu&s;t now be divided among &s;even millions and a half or eight millions. The poor con&s;e|quently mu&s;t live much wor&s;e, and many of them be reduced to &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s. The number of labourers al&s;o being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour mu&s;t tend toward a decrea&s;e; while the price of pro|vi&s;ions would at the &s;ame time tend to rife. The labourer therefore mu&s;t work harder to earn the &s;ame as he did before. Dur|ing this &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s, the di&s;courage|ments to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are &s;o great, that popu|lation is at a &s;tand. In the mean time the cheapne&s;s of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the nece&s;sity of an in|crea&s;ed indu&s;try among&s;t them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fre&s;h &s;oil, and to
<PB N="31" REF="47">
manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence become in the &s;ame proportion to the population as at the period from which we &s;et out. The &s;ituation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the re&s;traints to population are in &s;ome degree loo&s;ened; and the &s;ame retrograde and progre&s;sive movements with re&s;pect to happine&s;s are repeated.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of o&s;cillation will not be re|marked by &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers; and it may be difficult even for the mo&s;t pene|trating mind to calculate its periods. Yet that in all old &s;tates &s;ome &s;uch vi|bration does exi&s;t; though from various tran&s;ver&s;e cau&s;es, in a much le&s;s marked, and in a much more irregular manner than I have de&s;cribed it, no reflecting
<PB N="32" REF="48">
man who con&s;iders the &s;ubject deeply can well doubt.</P>
<P>Many rea&s;ons occur why this o&s;cilla|tion has been le&s;s obvious, and le&s;s de|cidedly confirmed by experience, than might naturally be expected.</P>
<P>One principal rea&s;on is, that the hi&s;|tories of mankind that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, are hi&s;tories only of the higher cla&s;&s;es. We have but few accounts that can be de|pended upon of the manners and cu&s;toms of that part of mankind, where the&s;e retrograde and progre&s;sive movements chiefly take place. A &s;atisfactory hi&s;|tory of this kind, of one people, and of one period, would require the con&s;tant and minute attention of an ob&s;erving mind during a long life. Some of the objects of enquiry would be, in what proportion to the number of adults was
<PB N="33" REF="49">
the number of marriages: to what ex|tent vicious cu&s;toms prevailed in con&s;e|quence of the re&s;traints upon matrimony: what was the comparative mortality among the children of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed part of the community, and tho&s;e who lived rather more at their ea&s;e: what were the variations in the real price of labour: and what were the ob&s;ervable differences in the &s;tate of the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, with re&s;pect to ea&s;e and hap|pine&s;s, at different times during a certain period.</P>
<P>Such a hi&s;tory would tend greatly to elucidate the manner in which the con|&s;tant check upon population acts; and would probably prove the exi&s;tence of the retrograde and progre&s;sive move|ments that have been mentioned; though the times of their vibration mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be rendered irregular, from the
<PB N="34" REF="50">
operation of many interrupting cau&s;es; &s;uch as, the introduction or failure of certain manufactures: a greater or le&s;s prevalent &s;pirit of agricultural enterprize: years of plenty, or years of &s;carcity: wars and pe&s;tilence: poor laws: the in|vention of proce&s;&s;es for &s;hortening labour without the proportional exten&s;ion of the market for the commodity: and, par|ticularly, the difference between the nominal and real price of labour; a cir|cum&s;tance, which has perhaps more than any other, contributed to conceal this o&s;cillation from common view.</P>
<P>It very rarely happens that the nomi|nal price of labour univer&s;ally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the &s;ame, while the nominal price of provi&s;ions has been gradually increa&s;ing. This is, in effect, a real fall in the price of labour; and during this
<PB N="35" REF="51">
period, the condition of the lower orders of the community mu&s;t gradually grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e. But the farmers and capi|tali&s;ts are growing rich from the real cheap|ne&s;s of labour. Their increa&s;ed capitals en|able them to employ a greater number of men. Work therefore may be plentiful; and the price of labour would con&s;e|quently ri&s;e. But the want of freedom in the market of labour, which occurs more or le&s;s in all communities, either from pari&s;h laws, or the more general cau&s;e of the facility of combination among the rich, and its difficulty among the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour from ri&s;ing at the natural period, and keeps it down &s;ome time longer; perhaps, till a year of &s;carcity, when the clamour is too loud, and the necessity too apparent to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="52">
The true cau&s;e of the advance in the price of labour is thus concealed; and the rich affect to grant it as an act of compa&s;sion and favour to the poor, in con&s;ideration of a year of &s;carcity; and when plenty returns, indulge them&s;elves in the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable of all com|plaints, that the price does not again fall; when a little reflection would &s;hew them, that it mu&s;t have ri&s;en long be|fore, but from an unju&s;t con&s;piracy of their own.</P>
<P>But though the rich by unfair combi|nations, contribute frequently to prolong a &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s among the poor; yet no po&s;sible form of &s;ociety could pre|vent the almo&s;t con&s;tant action of mi&s;ery, upon a great part of mankind, if in a &s;tate of inequality, and upon all, if all were equal.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="53">
The theory, on which the truth of this po&s;ition depends, appears to me &s;o extremely clear; that I feel at a lo&s;s to conjecture what part of it can be de|nied.</P>
<P>That population cannot increa&s;e with|out the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is a propo|&s;ition &s;o evident, that it needs no illu&s;|tration.</P>
<P>That population does invariably in|crea&s;e, where there are the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the hi&s;tory of every people that have ever exi&s;ted will abundantly prove.</P>
<P>And, that the &s;uperior power of population cannot be checked, without producing mi&s;ery or vice, the ample portion of the&s;e too bitter ingredients in the cup of human life, and the con|tinuance

of the phy&s;ical cau&s;es that &s;eem to have produced them, bear too con|vincing a te&s;timony.</P>
<P>But in order more fully to a&s;certain the validity of the&s;e three propo&s;itions, let us examine the different &s;tates in which mankind have been known to exi&s;t.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the rude&s;t &s;tate of mankind, in which hunting is the principal occu|pation, and the only mode of acquiring food; the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence being &s;cattered over a large extent of territory, the comparative population mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be thin. It is &s;aid, that the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes is le&s;s ardent among the North American Indians, than among any other race of men. Yet notwith&s;tanding this apathy, the effort towards population, even in this people, &s;eems to be always greater than the means to &s;upport it. This appears, from
<PB N="40" REF="56">
the comparatively rapid population that takes place, whenever any of the tribes happen to &s;ettle in &s;ome fertile &s;pot, and to draw nouri&s;hment from more fruitful &s;ources than that of hunting; and it has been frequently remarked, that when an Indian family has taken up its abode near any European &s;ettle|ment, and adopted a more ea&s;y and civilized mode of life, that one woman has reared five or &s;ix, or more children; though in the &s;avage &s;tate, it rarely hap|pens, that above one or two in a family grow up to maturity. The &s;ame ob&s;er|vation has been made with regard to the Hottentots near the Cape. The&s;e facts prove the &s;uperior power of population to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in nations of hunters; and that this power always &s;hews it&s;elf the moment it is left to act with freedom.</P>

<P>The North American Indians, con&s;i|dered as a people, cannot ju&s;tly be called free and equal. In all the accounts we have of them, and, indeed, of mo&s;t other &s;avage nations, the women are repre&s;ented as much more completely in a &s;tate of &s;lavery to the men, than the poor are to the rich in civilized countries. One half the nation appears to act as Helots to the other half: and the mi&s;ery that checks population falls chiefly, as it always mu&s;t do, upon that part who&s;e condition is lowe&s;t in the &s;cale of &s;ociety. The infancy of man in the &s;imple&s;t &s;tate requires con&s;idera|ble attention; but this nece&s;&s;ary atten|tion the women cannot give, condemned

as they are, to the inconveniences and hard&s;hips of frequent change of place, and to the con&s;tant and unre|mitting drudgery of preparing every thing for the reception of their tyran|nic lords. The&s;e exertions, &s;ometimes, during pregnancy, or with children at their backs, mu&s;t occa&s;ion frequent mi&s;|carriages, and prevent any but the mo&s;t robu&s;t infants from growing to matu|rity. Add to the&s;e hard&s;hips of the women, the con&s;tant war that prevails among &s;avages, and the nece&s;sity which they frequently labour under of expo|&s;ing their aged and helple&s;s parents, and of thus violating the fir&s;t feelings of nature; and the picture will not ap|pear very free from the blot of mi&s;ery. In e&s;timating the happine&s;s of a &s;avage nation, we mu&s;t not fix our eyes only on the warrior in the prime of life: he is one of a hundred: he is the gentle|man,

was in greater plenty; and that, put|ting vice out of the que&s;tion among &s;a|vages, mi&s;ery is the check that repre&s;&s;es the &s;uperior power of population, and keeps its effects equal to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Actual ob&s;ervation and ex|perience, tell us that this check, with a few local and temporary exceptions, is con&s;tantly acting now upon all &s;a|vage nations; and the theory indicates, that it probably acted with nearly equal &s;trength a thou&s;and years ago, and it may not be much greater a thou&s;and years hence.</P>
<P>Of the manners and habits that pre|vail among nations of &s;hepherds, the next &s;tate of mankind, we are even more ignorant than of the &s;avage &s;tate. But that the&s;e nations could not e&s;cape the general lot of mi&s;ery ari&s;ing from the want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, Europe, and

all the faire&s;t countries in the world, bear ample te&s;timony. Want was the goad that drove the Scythian &s;hepherds from their native haunts, like &s;o many fami&s;hed wolves in &s;earch of prey. Set in motion by this all powerful cau&s;e, clouds of Barbarians &s;eemed to collect from all points of the northern hemi&s;|phere. Gathering fre&s;h darkne&s;s, and terror, as they rolled on, the congre|gated bodies at length ob&s;cured the &s;un of Italy, and &s;unk the whole world in univer&s;al night. The&s;e tremendous ef|fects, &s;o long and &s;o deeply felt through|out the faire&s;t portions of the earth, may be traced to the &s;imple cau&s;e of the &s;uperior power of population, to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is well known, that a country in pa&s;ture cannot &s;upport &s;o many inha|bitants as a country in tillage; but what
<PB N="46" REF="62">
renders nations of &s;hepherds &s;o formida|ble, is, the power which they po&s;&s;e&s;s of moving all together, and the nece&s;sity they frequently feel of exerting this power in &s;earch of fre&s;h pa&s;ture for their herds. A tribe that was rich in cattle, had an immediate plenty of food. Even the parent &s;tock might be devoured in a ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;sity. The wo|men lived in greater ea&s;e than among nations of hunters. The men bold in their united &s;trength, and confiding in their power of procuring pa&s;ture for their cattle by change of place, felt, probably, but few fears about providing for a family. The&s;e combined cau&s;es &s;oon produced their natural and inva|riable effect, an extended population. A more frequent and rapid change of place became then nece&s;&s;ary. A wider and more exten&s;ive territory was &s;ucce&s;sively occupied. A broader de&s;olation extend|ed

all around them. Want pinched the le&s;s fortunate members of the &s;ociety: and, at length, the impo&s;sibility of &s;upporting &s;uch a number together be|came too evident to be re&s;i&s;ted. Young &s;cions were then pu&s;hed out from the parent-&s;tock, and in&s;tructed to explore fre&s;h regions, and to gain happier &s;eats for them&s;elves by their &s;words. <Q>The world was all before them where to chu&s;e.</Q> Re&s;tle&s;s from pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; flu&s;hed with the hope of fairer pro&s;|pects; and animated with the &s;pirit of hardy enterprize, the&s;e daring adventu|rers were likely to become formidable adver&s;aries to all who oppo&s;ed them. The peaceful inhabitants of the coun|tries on which they ru&s;hed, could not long with&s;tand the energy of men acting under &s;uch powerful motives of exertion. And when they fell in with any tribes like their own, the conte&s;t was a
<PB N="48" REF="64">
&s;truggle for exi&s;tence; and they &s;ought with a de&s;perate courage, in&s;pired by the reflection, that death was the puni&s;hment of defeat, and life the prize of victory.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;avage conte&s;ts many tribes mu&s;t have been utterly exterminated. Some, probably, peri&s;hed by hard&s;hip and famine. Others, who&s;e leading &s;tar had given them a happier direction, became great and powerful tribes; and, in their turns, &s;ent off fre&s;h adventu|rers in &s;earch of &s;till more fertile &s;eats. The prodigious wa&s;te of human life oc|ca&s;ioned by this perpetual &s;truggle for room and food, was more than &s;upplied by the mighty power of population, acting, in &s;ome degree, un&s;hackled, from the con&s;tant habit of emigration. The tribes that migrated towards the South, though they won the&s;e more fruitful regions by continual battles, rapidly increa&s;ed
<PB N="49" REF="65">
in number and power, from the in|crea&s;ed means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Till, at length, the whole territory, from the confines of China to the &s;hores of the Baltic, was peopled by a various race of Barbarians, brave, robu&s;t, and enter|pri&s;ing; inured to hard&s;hip, and delight|ing in war. Some tribes maintained their independence. Others ranged them|them&s;elves under the &s;tandard of &s;ome barbaric chieftain, who led them to victory after victory; and what was of more importance, to regions abounding in corn, wine and oil, the long wi&s;hed for con&s;ummation, and great reward of their labours. An Alaric, an Attila or a Zingis Khan, and the chiefs around them, might fight for glory, for the &s;ame of exten&s;ive conque&s;ts; but the true cau&s;e that &s;et in motion the great tide of northern emigration, and that continued to propel it till it rolled at
<PB N="50" REF="66">
different periods, again&s;t China, Per&s;ia, Italy, and even Egypt, was a &s;carcity of food, a population extended beyond the means of &s;upporting it.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute population at any one period, in proportion to the extent of territory, could never be great, on ac|count of the unproductive nature of &s;ome of the regions occupied: but there appears to have been a mo&s;t rapid &s;uc|ce&s;sion of human beings; and as fa&s;t as &s;ome were moved down by the &s;cythe of war, or of famine, others ro&s;e in in|crea&s;ed numbers to &s;upply their place. Among the&s;e bold and improvident Bar|barians, population was probably but little checked, as in modern &s;tates, from a fear of future difficulties. A prevail|ing hope of bettering their condition by change of place; a con&s;tant expec|tation of plunder; a power even, if

<P>Where there is any inequality of con|ditions, and among nations of &s;hep|herds this &s;oon takes place, the di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, mu&s;t fall harde&s;t upon the lea&s;t fortu|nate members of the &s;ociety. This di&s;|tre&s;s al&s;o mu&s;t frequently have been felt by the women, expo&s;ed to ca&s;ual plunder in the ab&s;ence of their hu&s;|bands, and &s;ubject to continual di&s;ap|pointments in their expected return.</P>
<P>But without knowing enough of the minute and intimate hi&s;tory of the&s;e people, to point out preci&s;ely on what
<PB N="52" REF="68">
part the di&s;tre&s;s for want of food chiefly fell; and to what extent it was generally felt; I think we may fairly &s;ay, from all the accounts that we have of nations of &s;hep|herds, that population invariably increa&s;ed among them, whenever, by emigration, or any other cau&s;e, the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence were increa&s;ed; and, that a fur|ther population was checked, and the actual population kept equal to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by mi&s;ery and vice.</P>
<P>For, independently of any vicious cu&s;|toms that might have prevailed among&s;t them with regard to women, which al|ways operate as checks to population, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, I think, that the commi&s;sion of war is vice, and the ef|fect of it, mi&s;ery; and none can doubt the mi&s;ery of want of food.</P>

<P>IN examining the next &s;tate of man|kind with relation to the que&s;tion be|fore us, the &s;tate of mixed pa&s;ture and tillage, in which, with &s;ome variation in the proportions, the mo&s;t civilized nations mu&s;t always remain; we &s;hall be a&s;si&s;ted in our review by what we daily &s;ee around us, by actual experience, by facts that come within the &s;cope of every man's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the exaggerations of &s;ome old hi&s;torians, there can remain
<PB N="54" REF="70">
no doubt in the mind of any thinking man, that the population of the princi|pal countries of Europe, France, Eng|land, Germany, Ru&s;sia, Poland, Sweden, and Denmark, is much greater than ever it was in former times. The ob|vious rea&s;on of the&s;e exaggerations, is, the formidable a&s;pect that even a thinly peopled nation mu&s;t have, when col|lected together, and moving all at once in &s;earch of fre&s;h &s;eats. If to this tre|mendous appearance be added a &s;uc|ce&s;sion at certain intervals of &s;imilar emigrations, we &s;hall not be much &s;ur|pri&s;ed that the fears of the timid na|tions of the South, repre&s;ented the North as a region ab&s;olutely &s;warming with human beings. A nearer and ju&s;ter view of the &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, enables us to &s;ee, that the inference was as ab&s;urd, as if a man in this country, who was continually meeting on the
<PB N="55" REF="71">
road droves of cattle from Wales and the North, was immediately to conclude that the&s;e countries were the mo&s;t pro|ductive of all the parts of the king|dom.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on that the greater part of Europe is more populous now than it was in former times, is, that the indu&s;|try of the inhabitants has made the&s;e countries produce a greater quantity of human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. For, I conceive, that it may be laid down as a po&s;ition not to be controverted, that, taking a &s;uf|ficient extent of territory to include within it exportation and importation; and allowing &s;ome variation for the prevalence of luxury, or of frugal habits; that population con&s;tantly bears a regu|lar proportion to the food that the earth is made to produce. In the contro|ver&s;y concerning the populou&s;ne&s;s of an|cient
<PB N="56" REF="72">
and modern nations, could it be clearly a&s;certained that the average pro|duce of the countries in que&s;tion, taken altogether, is greater now than it was in the times of Julius Cae&s;ar, the di&s;|pute would be at once determined.</P>
<P>When we are a&s;&s;ured that China is the mo&s;t fertile country in the world; that almo&s;t all the land is in tillage; and that a great part of it bears two crops every year; and further, that the people live very frugally, we may infer with certainty, that the population mu&s;t be immen&s;e, without bu&s;ying our&s;elves in inquiries into the manners and ha|bits of the lower cla&s;&s;es, and the encou|ragements to early marriages. But the&s;e inquiries, are of the utmo&s;t importance, and a minute hi&s;tory of the cu&s;toms of the lower Chine&s;e would be of the greate&s;t u&s;e, in a&s;certaining in what
<PB N="57" REF="73">
manner the checks to a further popu|lation operate; what are the vices, and what are the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that prevent an increa&s;e of numbers beyond the ability of the country to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Hume, in his e&s;&s;ay on the populou&s;|ne&s;s of ancient and modern nations, when he intermingles, as he &s;ays, an in|quiry concerning cau&s;es, with that con|cerning facts, does not &s;eem to &s;ee with his u&s;ual penetration, how very little &s;ome of the cau&s;es he alludes to could enable him to form any judgment of the actual population of ancient nations. If any inference can be drawn from them, perhaps it &s;hould be directly the rever&s;e of what Hume draws, though I certainly ought to &s;peak with great di&s;|&s;idence in di&s;&s;enting from a man, who of all others on &s;uch &s;ubjects was the lea&s;t likely to be deceived by fir&s;t appear|ances.
<PB N="58" REF="74">
If I find that at a certain pe|riod in ancient hi&s;tory, the encourage|ments to have a family were great, that early marriages were con&s;equently very prevalent, and that few per&s;ons remain|ed &s;ingle, I &s;hould infer with certainty that population was rapidly increa&s;ing, but by no means that it was then ac|tually very great; rather, indeed, the contrary, that it was then thin, and that there was room and food for a much greater number. On the other hand, if I find that at this period the difficulties attending a family were very great; that, con&s;equently, few early marriages took place, and that a great number of both &s;exes remained &s;ingle, I infer with certainty that population was at a &s;tand; and, probably, becau&s;e the actual popu|lation was very great in proportion to the fertility of the land, and that there was &s;carcely room and food for more.
<PB N="59" REF="75">
The number of footmen, hou&s;emaids, and other per&s;ons remaining unmarried in modern &s;tates, Hume allows to be ra|ther an argument again&s;t their popula|tion. I &s;hould rather draw a contrary inference, and con&s;ider it an argument of their fullne&s;s; though this inference is not certain, becau&s;e there are many thinly inhabited &s;tates that are yet &s;ta|tionary in their population. To &s;peak, therefore, correctly, perhaps it may be &s;aid, that the number of unmarried per|&s;ons in proportion to the whole num|ber, exi&s;ting at different periods, in the &s;ame, or different &s;tates, will enable us to judge whether population at the&s;e periods, was increa&s;ing, &s;tationary, or de|crea&s;ing, but will form no criterion by which we can determine the actual po|pulation.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76">
There is, however, a circum&s;tance taken notice of in mo&s;t of the accounts we have of China, that it &s;eems difficult to reconcile with this rea&s;oning. It is &s;aid, that early marriages very generally prevail through all the ranks of the Chine&s;e. Yet Dr. Adam Smith &s;up|po&s;es that population in China is &s;ta|tionary. The&s;e two circum&s;tances ap|pear to be irreconcileable. It certainly &s;eems very little probable that the po|pulation of China is fa&s;t increa&s;ing. Every acre of land has been &s;o long in cultivation, that we can hardly con|ceive there is any great yearly addition to the average produce. The fact, per|haps, of the univer&s;ality of early mar|riages may not be &s;ufficiently a&s;cer|tained. If it be &s;uppo&s;ed true, the only way of accounting for the diffi|culty, with our pre&s;ent knowledge of the &s;ubject, appears to be, that the redun|dant
<PB N="61" REF="77">
population, nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned by the prevalence of early marriages, mu&s;t be repre&s;&s;ed by occa&s;ional famines, and by the cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing chil|dren, which, in times of di&s;tre&s;s, is pro|bably more frequent than is ever ac|knowledged to Europeans. Relative to this barbarous practice, it is difficult to avoid remarking, that there cannot be a &s;tronger proof of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es that have been felt by mankind for want of food, than the exi&s;tence of a cu&s;tom that thus violates the mo&s;t natural principle of the human heart. It appears to have been very general among ancient na|tions, and certainly tended rather to in|crea&s;e population.</P>
<P>In examining the principal &s;tates of modern Europe, we &s;hall find, that though they have increa&s;ed very con|&s;iderably in population &s;ince they were
<PB N="62" REF="78">
nations of &s;hepherds, yet that, at pre|&s;ent, their progre&s;s is but &s;low; and in&s;tead of doubling their numbers every twenty|five years, they require three or four hundred years, or more, for that pur|po&s;e. Some, indeed, may be ab&s;olutely &s;tationary, and others even retrograde. The cau&s;e of this &s;low progre&s;s in po|pulation cannot be traced to a decay of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes. We have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think that this natural propen&s;ity exi&s;ts &s;till in undimi|ni&s;hed vigour. Why then do not its effects appear in a rapid increa&s;e of the human &s;pecies? An intimate view of the &s;tate of &s;ociety in any one coun|try in Europe, which may &s;erve equally for all, will enable us to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, and to &s;ay, that a fore&s;ight of the difficulties attending the rearing of a family, acts as a preventive check; and the actual di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;ome of the
<PB N="63" REF="79">
lower cla&s;&s;es, by which they are di&s;|abled from giving the proper food and attention to their children, acts as a po|&s;itive check, to the natural increa&s;e of population.</P>
<P>England, as one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tates of Europe, may be fairly taken for an example, and the ob&s;ervations made, will apply with but little varia|tion to any other country where the population increa&s;es &s;lowly.</P>
<P>The preventive check appears to ope|rate in &s;ome degree through all the ranks of &s;ociety in England. There are &s;ome men, even in the highe&s;t rank, who are prevented from marrying by the idea of the expences that they mu&s;t retrench, and the fancied plea&s;ures that they mu&s;t deprive them&s;elves of, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of having a family. The&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="80">
con&s;iderations are certainly trivial; but a preventive fore&s;ight of this kind has objects of much greater weight for its contemplation as we go lower.</P>
<P>A man of liberal education, but with an income only ju&s;t &s;ufficient to enable him to a&s;&s;ociate in the rank of gentle|men, mu&s;t feel ab&s;olutely certain, that if he marries and has a family, he &s;hall be obliged, if he mixes at all in &s;ociety, to rank him&s;elf with moderate farmers, and the lower cla&s;s of trade&s;|men. The woman that a man of edu|cation would naturally make the object of his choice, would be one brought up in the &s;ame ta&s;tes and &s;entiments with him&s;elf, and u&s;ed to the familiar intercour&s;e of a &s;ociety totally different from that to which &s;he mu&s;t be re|duced by marriage. Can a man con|&s;ent to place the object of his affec|tion
<PB N="65" REF="81">
in a &s;ituation &s;o di&s;cordant, proba|bly, to her ta&s;tes and inclinations? Two or three &s;teps of de&s;cent in &s;o|ciety, particularly at this round of the ladder, where education ends, and igno|rance begins, will not be con&s;idered by the generality of people, as a fan|cied and chimerical, but a real and e&s;|&s;ential evil. If &s;ociety be held de&s;irea|ble, it &s;urely mu&s;t be free, equal, and reciprocal &s;ociety, where benefits are conferred as well as received; and not &s;uch as the dependent finds with his patron, or the poor with the rich.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations undoubtedly pre|vent a great number in this rank of life from following the bent of their in|clinations in an early attachment. Others, guided either by a &s;tronger pa&s;sion, or a weaker judgment, break through the&s;e re&s;traints; and it would be hard indeed,
<PB N="66" REF="82">
if the gratification of &s;o delightful a pa&s;sion as virtuous love, did not, &s;ome|times, more than counterbalance all its attendant evils. But I fear it mu&s;t be owned, that the more general con&s;e|quences of &s;uch marriages, are rather calculated to ju&s;tify, than to repre&s;s, the forebodings of the prudent.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of trade&s;men and farmers are exhorted not to marry, and generally find it nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue this advice, till they are &s;ettled in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, or farm, that may enable them to &s;up|port a family. The&s;e events may not, perhaps, occur till they are far advanced in life. The &s;carcity of farms is a very general complaint in England. And the competition in every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o great, that it is not po&s;sible that all &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="83">
The labourer who earns eighteen pence a day, and lives with &s;ome degree of comfort as a &s;ingle man, will he&s;i|tate a little before he divides that pit|tance among four or five, which &s;eems to be but ju&s;t &s;ufficient for one. Harder fare and harder labour he would &s;ub|mit to, for the &s;ake of living with the woman that he loves; but he mu&s;t feel con&s;cious, if he thinks at all, that, &s;hould he have a large family, and any ill luck whatever, no degree of fruga|lity, no po&s;sible exertion of his manual &s;trength, could pre&s;erve him from the heart rending &s;en&s;ation of &s;eeing his children &s;tarve, or of forfeiting his inde|pendence, and being obliged to the pa|ri&s;h for their &s;upport.

<P>If this &s;ketch of the &s;tate of &s;ociety in England be near the truth, and I do not conceive that it is exaggerated, it will be allowed, that the preventive check to population in this country operates, though with varied force, through all the cla&s;&s;es of the commu|nity. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation will hold true with regard to all old &s;tates. The effects, indeed, of the&s;e re&s;traints upon marriage are but too con&s;picuous in the

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The &s;econd, or po&s;itive check to population examined, in England.&mdash;The true cau&s;e why the immen&s;e &s;um col|lected in England for the poor does not better their con|dition.&mdash;The powerful tendency of the poor laws to de|feat their own purpo&s;e.&mdash;Palliative of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor propo&s;ed.&mdash;The ab&s;olute impo&s;sibility from the fixed laws of our nature, that the pre&s;&s;ure of want can ever be completely removed from the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;o|ciety.&mdash;All the checks to population may be re&s;olved into mi&s;ery or vice.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE po&s;itive check to population, by which I mean, the check that repre&s;&s;es an increa&s;e which is already begun, is confined chiefly, though not perhaps &s;olely, to the lowe&s;t orders of &s;ociety. This check is not &s;o obvious to common view as the other I have mentioned; and, to prove di&s;tinctly the force and extent of its operation, would require, perhaps, more data than we are in po&s;|&s;e&s;sion of. But I believe it has been
<PB N="72" REF="88">
very generally remarked by tho&s;e who have attended to hills of mortality, that of the number of children who die an|nually, much too great a proportion belongs to tho&s;e, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed unable to give their offspring proper food and attention; expo&s;ed as they are occa&s;ionally to &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s, and confined, perhaps, to unwhole&s;ome ha|bitations and hard labour. This mor|tality among the children of the poor has been con&s;tantly taken notice of in all towns. It certainly does not pre|vail in an equal degree in the country; but the &s;ubject has not hitherto received &s;ufficient attention to enable any one to &s;ay, that there are not more deaths in proportion, among the children of the poor, even in the country, than among tho&s;e of the middling and higher cla&s;&s;es. Indeed, it &s;eems difficult to &s;up|po&s;e that a labourer's wife who has &s;ix
<PB N="73" REF="89">
children, and who is &s;ometimes in ab&s;o|lute want of bread, &s;hould be able al|ways to give them the food and atten|tion nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport life. The &s;ons and daughters of pea&s;ants will not be found &s;uch ro&s;y cherubs in real life, as they are de&s;cribed to be in romances. It cannot fail to be remarked by tho&s;e who live much in the country, that the &s;ons of labourers are very apt to be &s;tunted in their growth, and are a long while arriving at maturity. Boys that you would gue&s;s to be fourteen or fif|teen, are upon inquiry, frequently found to be eighteen or nineteen. And the lads who drive plough, which mu&s;t cer|tainly be a healthy exerci&s;e, are very rarely &s;een with any appearance of calves to their legs; a circum&s;tance, which can only be attributed to a want either of proper, or of &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="90">
To remedy the frequent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the common people, the poor laws of England have been in&s;tituted; but it is to be feared, that though they may have alleviated a little the inten&s;ity of indi|vidual misfortune, they have &s;pread the general evil over a much larger &s;urface. It is a &s;ubject often &s;tarted in conver|&s;ation, and mentioned always as a mat|ter of great &s;urpri&s;e, that notwith&s;tand|ing the immen&s;e &s;um that is annually collected for the poor in England, there is &s;till &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s among them. Some think that the money mu&s;t be embezzled; others that the church|wardens and over&s;eers con&s;ume the greater part of it in dinners. All agree that &s;ome how or other it mu&s;t be very ill|managed. In &s;hort the fact, that nearly three millions are collected annually for the poor, and yet that their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es are not removed, is the &s;ubject
<PB N="75" REF="91">
of continual a&s;toni&s;hment. But a man who &s;ees a little below the &s;urface of things, would be very much more a&s;toni&s;hed, if the fact were otherwi&s;e than it is ob|&s;erved to be, or even if a collection univer&s;ally of eighteen &s;hillings in the pound in&s;tead of four, were materially to alter it. I will &s;tate a ca&s;e which I hope will elucidate my meaning.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, that by a &s;ub&s;cription of the rich, the eighteen pence a day which men earn now, was made up five &s;hil|lings, it might be imagined, perhaps, that they would then be able to live comfortably, and have a piece of meat every day for their dinners. But this would be a very fal&s;e conclu&s;ion. The transfer of three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence a day to every labourer, would not in|crea&s;e the quantity of meat in the coun|try. There is not at pre&s;ent enough
<PB N="76" REF="92">
for all to have a decent &s;hare. What would then be the con&s;equence? The competition among the buyers in the market of meat, would rapidly rai&s;e the price from &s;ix pence or &s;even pence, to two or three &s;hillings in the pound; and the commodity would not be di|vided among many more than it is at pre&s;ent. When an article is &s;carce, and cannot be di&s;tributed to all, he that can &s;hew the mo&s;t valid patent, that is, he that offers mo&s;t money becomes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. If we can &s;uppo&s;e the com|petition among the buyers of meat to continue long enough for a greater num|ber of cattle to be reared annually, this could only be done at the expence of the corn, which would be a very di&s;advantageous exchange; for it is well known that the country could not then &s;upport the &s;ame population; and when &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is &s;carce in proportion to the
<PB N="77" REF="93">
number of people, it is of little con&s;e|quence whether the lowe&s;t members of the &s;ociety po&s;&s;e&s;s eighteen pence or five &s;hillings. They mu&s;t at all events be reduced to live upon the harde&s;t fare, and in the &s;malle&s;t quantity.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, perhaps, that the in|crea&s;ed number of purcha&s;ers in every article, would give a &s;pur to produc|tive indu&s;try, and that the whole pro|duce of the i&s;land would be increa&s;ed. This might in &s;ome degree be the ca&s;e. But the &s;pur that the&s;e fancied riches would give to population, would more than counterbalance it, and the increa&s;ed produce would be to be di|vided among a more than proportion|ably increa&s;ed number of people. All this time I am &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;ame quantity of work would be done as be|fore. But this would not really take
<PB N="78" REF="94">
place. The receipt of five &s;hillings a day, in&s;tead of eighteen pence, would make every man fancy him&s;elf compa|ratively rich, and able to indulge him|&s;elf in many hours or days of lei&s;ure. This would give a &s;trong and imme|diate check to productive indu&s;try; and in a &s;hort time, not only the nation would be poorer, but the lower cla&s;&s;es them&s;elves would be much more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed than when they received only eighteen pence a day.</P>
<P>A collection from the rich of eighteen &s;hillings in the pound, even if di&s;tri|buted in the mo&s;t judicious manner, would have a little the &s;ame effect as that re&s;ulting from the &s;uppo&s;ition I have ju&s;t made; and no po&s;sible con|tributions or &s;acrifices of the rich, par|ticularly in money, could for any time prevent the recurrence of di&s;tre&s;s among
<PB N="79" REF="95">
the lower members of &s;ociety whoever they were. Great changes might, in|deed, be made. The rich might become poor, and &s;ome of the poor rich: but a part of the &s;ociety mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel a difficulty of living; and this difficulty will naturally fall on the lea&s;t fortunate members.</P>
<P>It may at fir&s;t appear &s;trange, but I believe it is true, that I cannot by means of money rai&s;e a poor man, and enable him to live much better than he did before, without proportionably depre&s;sing others in the &s;ame cla&s;s. If I retrench the quantity of food con|&s;umed in my hou&s;e, and give him what I have cut off, I then benefit him, without depre&s;sing any but my&s;elf and family, who, perhaps, may be well able to bear it. If I turn up a piece of uncultivated land, and give him the produce, I then
<PB N="80" REF="96">
benefit both him, and all the members of the &s;ociety, becau&s;e what he before con&s;umed is thrown into the common &s;tock, and probably &s;ome of the new produce with it. But if I only give him money, &s;uppo&s;ing the produce of the country to remain the &s;ame, I give him a title to a larger &s;hare of that produce than formerly, which &s;hare he cannot receive without dimini&s;hing the &s;hares of others. It is evident that this effect, in individual in&s;tances, mu&s;t be &s;o &s;mall as to be totally impercep|tible; but &s;till it mu&s;t exi&s;t, as many other effects do, which like &s;ome of the in&s;ects that people the air, elude our gro&s;&s;er perceptions.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the quantity of food in any country to remain the &s;ame for many years together; it is evident that this food mu&s;t be divided according to the
<PB N="81" REF="97">
value of each man's patent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Godwin calls the wealth that a man re|ceives from his ance&s;tors a mouldy patent. It may, I think, very properly be termed a patent; but I hardly &s;ee the propriety of calling it a mouldy one, as it is an article in &s;uch con&s;tant u&s;e.</NOTE>, or the &s;um of money that he can afford to &s;pend in this commodity &s;o univer&s;ally in reque&s;t. It is a demon&s;trative truth therefore, that the patents of one &s;et of men could not be increa&s;ed in value, without dimini&s;h|ing the value of the patents of &s;ome other &s;et of men. If the rich were to &s;ub&s;cribe, and give five &s;hillings a day to five hundred thou&s;and men without retrenching their own tables, no doubt can exi&s;t, that as the&s;e men would naturally live more at their ea&s;e, and con&s;ume a greater quantity of provi&s;ions, there would be le&s;s food remaining to divide among the re&s;t; and con&s;equently each man's patent would be dimini&s;hed
<PB N="82" REF="98">
in value, or the &s;ame number of pieces of &s;ilver would purcha&s;e a &s;maller quan|tity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>An increa&s;e of population without a proportional increa&s;e of food, will evi|dently have the &s;ame effect in lowering the value of each man's patent. The food mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;tributed in &s;maller quantities, and con&s;equently a day's labour will purcha&s;e a &s;maller quan|tity of provi&s;ions. An increa&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions would ari&s;e, either from an increa&s;e of population fa&s;ter than the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; or from a different di&s;tribution of the money of the &s;ociety. The food of a country that has been long occupied, if it be in|crea&s;ing, increa&s;es &s;lowly and regularly, and cannot be made to an&s;wer any &s;ud|den demands; but variations in the di&s;|tribution of the money of a &s;ociety are
<PB N="83" REF="99">
not unfrequently occurring, and are un|doubtedly among the cau&s;es that occa|&s;ion the continual variations which we ob&s;erve in the price of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The poor-laws of England tend to de|pre&s;s the general condition of the poor in the&s;e two ways. Their fir&s;t obvious tendency is to increa&s;e population with|out increa&s;ing the food for its &s;upport. A poor man may marry with little or no pro&s;pect of being able to &s;upport a family in independence. They may be &s;aid therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure to create the poor which they maintain; and as the provi&s;ions of the country mu&s;t, in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed population, be di&s;tributed to every man in &s;maller proportions, it is evident that the labour of tho&s;e who are not &s;upported by pari&s;h a&s;si&s;tance, will purcha&s;e a &s;maller quan|tity of provi&s;ions than before, and con|&s;equently
<PB N="84" REF="100">
more of them mu&s;t be driven to a&s;k for &s;upport.</P>
<P>Secondly, the quantity of provi&s;ions con&s;umed in workhou&s;es upon a part of the &s;ociety, that cannot in general be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t valuable part, dimini&s;hes the &s;hares that would other|wi&s;e belong to more indu&s;trious, and more worthy members; and thus in the &s;ame manner forces more to become de|pendent. If the poor in the workhou&s;es were to live better than they now do, this new di&s;tribution of the money of the &s;ociety would tend more con|&s;picuou&s;ly to depre&s;s the condition of tho&s;e out of the workhou&s;es, by occa&s;ion|ing a ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fortunately for England, a &s;pirit of independence &s;till remains among the pea&s;antry. The poor-laws are &s;trongly
<PB N="85" REF="101">
calculated to eradicate this &s;pirit. They have &s;ucceeded in part; but had they &s;ucceeded as completely as might have been expected, their pernicious tendency would not have been &s;o long concealed.</P>
<P>Hard as it may appear in individual in&s;tances, dependent poverty ought to be held di&s;graceful. Such a &s;timulus &s;eems to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pro|mote the happine&s;s of the great ma&s;s of mankind; and every general attempt to weaken this &s;timulus, however benevo|lent its apparent intention, will always defeat its own purpo&s;e. If men are in|duced to marry from a pro&s;pect of pari&s;h provi&s;ion, with little or no chance of maintaining their families in indepen|dence, they are not only unju&s;tly tempt|ed to bring unhappine&s;s and dependence upon them&s;elves and children; but they are tempted, without knowing it, to injure all in the &s;ame cla&s;s with them|&s;elves.
<PB N="86" REF="102">
A labourer who marries without being able to &s;upport a family, may in &s;ome re&s;pects be con&s;idered as an enemy to all his fellow-labourers.</P>
<P>I feel no doubt whatever, that the pari&s;h laws of England have contributed to rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions, and to lower the real price of labour. They have there|fore contributed to impoveri&s;h that cla&s;s of people who&s;e only po&s;&s;e&s;sion is their labour. It is al&s;o difficult to &s;uppo&s;e that they have not powerfully contributed to generate that carele&s;ne&s;s, and want of frugality ob&s;ervable among the poor, &s;o contrary to the di&s;po&s;ition frequently to be re|marked among petty trade&s;men and &s;mall farmers. The labouring poor, to u&s;e a vulgar expre&s;sion, &s;eem always to live from hand to mouth. Their pre&s;ent wants employ their whole attention, and they &s;eldom think of the future. Even when they have an opportunity of &s;aving
<PB N="87" REF="103">
they &s;eldom exerci&s;e it; but all that is beyond their pre&s;ent nece&s;sities goes, generally &s;peaking, to the ale-hou&s;e. The poor-laws of England may therefore be &s;aid to dimini&s;h both the power and the will to &s;ave, among the common people, and thus to weaken one of the &s;tronge&s;t incentives to &s;obriety and indu&s;|try, and con&s;equently to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a general complaint among ma&s;ter manufacturers, that high wages ruin all their workmen; but it is difficult to con|ceive that the&s;e men would not &s;ave a part of their high wages for the future &s;upport of their families, in&s;tead of &s;pend|ing it in drunkenne&s;s and di&s;sipation, if they did not rely on pari&s;h a&s;si&s;tance for &s;upport in ca&s;e of accidents. And that the poor employed in manufactures con|&s;ider this a&s;si&s;tance as a rea&s;on why they may &s;pend all the wages they earn, and
<PB N="88" REF="104">
enjoy them&s;elves while they can, ap|pears to be evident from the number of families that, upon the failure of any great manufactory, immediately fall upon the pari&s;h; when perhaps the wages earned in this manufactory, while it flouri&s;hed, were &s;ufficiently above the price of common country labour, to have allowed them to &s;ave enough for their &s;upport, till they could find &s;ome other channel for their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>A man who might not be deterred from going to the ale-hou&s;e, from the con&s;ideration that on his death, or &s;ick|ne&s;s, he &s;hould leave his wife and family upon the pari&s;h, might yet he&s;itate in thus di&s;sipating his earnings, if he were a&s;&s;ured that, in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, his family mu&s;t &s;tarve, or be left to the &s;upport of ca&s;ual bounty. In China, where the real as well as nominal price of labour is
<PB N="89" REF="105">
very low, &s;ons are yet obliged by law to &s;upport their aged and helple&s;s parents. Whether &s;uch a law would be advi&s;eable in this country, I will not pretend to determine. But it &s;eems at any rate highly improper, by po&s;itive in&s;titutions, which render dependent poverty &s;o ge|neral, to weaken that di&s;grace, which for the be&s;t and mo&s;t humane rea&s;ons ought to attach to it.</P>
<P>The ma&s;s of happine&s;s among the com|mon people cannot but be dimini&s;hed, when one of the &s;tronge&s;t checks to idel|ne&s;s and di&s;sipation is thus removed; and when men are thus allured to marry with little or no pro&s;pect of being able to maintain a family in independence. Every ob&s;tacle in the way of marriage mu&s;t undoubtedly be con&s;idered as a &s;pe+cies of unhappine&s;s. But as from the laws of our nature &s;ome check to popu|lation
<PB N="90" REF="106">
mu&s;t exi&s;t, it is better that it &s;hould be checked from a fore&s;ight of the difficulties attending a family, and the fear of dependent poverty, than that it &s;hould be encouraged, only to be re|pre&s;&s;ed afterwards by want and &s;ick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered always, that there is an e&s;&s;ential difference between food, and tho&s;e wrought commodities, the raw materials of which are in great plenty. A demand for the&s;e la&s;t will not fail to create them in as great a quantity as they are wanted. The de|mand for food has by no means the &s;ame creative power. In a country where all the fertile &s;pots have been &s;eized, high offers are nece&s;&s;ary to encourage the farmer to lay his dre&s;sing on land, from which he cannot expect a profitable re|turn for &s;ome years. And before the
<PB N="91" REF="107">
pro&s;pect of advantage is &s;ufficiently great to encourage this &s;ort of agricultural en|terprize, and while the new produce is ri&s;ing, great di&s;tre&s;&s;es may be &s;uffered from the want of it. The demand for an increa&s;ed quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is, with few exceptions, con&s;tant every where, yet we &s;ee how &s;lowly it is an|&s;wered in all tho&s;e countries that have been long occupied.</P>
<P>The poor-laws of England were un|doubtedly in&s;tituted for the mo&s;t benevo|lent purpo&s;e; but there is great rea&s;on to think that they have not &s;ucceeded in their intention. They certainly mitigate &s;ome ca&s;es of very &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s which might otherwi&s;e occur; yet the &s;tate of the poor who are &s;upported by pari&s;hes, con&s;idered in all its circum&s;tances, is very far from being free from mi&s;ery. But one of the principal objections to
<PB N="92" REF="108">
them is, that for this a&s;si&s;tance which &s;ome of the poor receive, in it&s;elf almo&s;t a doubtful ble&s;sing, the whole cla&s;s of the common people of England, is &s;ub|jected to a &s;et of grating, inconvenient, and tyrannical laws, totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the genuine &s;pirit of the con&s;titu|tion. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ettlements, even in its pre&s;ent amended &s;tate, is utterly contradictory to all ideas of free|dom. The pari&s;h per&s;ecution of men who&s;e families are likely to become chargeable, and of poor women who are near lying-in, is a mo&s;t di&s;graceful and di&s;gu&s;ting tyranny. And the ob&s;truc|tions continually occa&s;ioned in the mar|ket of labour by the&s;e laws, have a con|&s;tant tendency to add to the difficulties of tho&s;e who are &s;truggling to &s;upport them&s;elves without a&s;si&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="109">
The&s;e evils attendant on the poor-laws, are in &s;ome degree irremediable. If a&s;si&s;t|ance be to be di&s;tributed to a certain cla&s;s of people, a power mu&s;t be given &s;ome|where of di&s;criminating the proper ob|jects, and of managing the concerns of the in&s;titutions that are nece&s;&s;ary; but any great interference with the affairs of other people, is a &s;pecies of tyranny; and in the common cour&s;e of things, the exerci&s;e of this power may be expected to become grating to tho&s;e who are driven to a&s;k for &s;upport. The tyranny of Ju&s;tices, Churchwardens, and Over|&s;eers, is a common complaint among the poor: but the fault does not lie &s;o much in the&s;e per&s;ons, who probably before they were in power, were not wor&s;e than other people; but in the nature of all &s;uch in&s;titutions.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="110">
The evil is perhaps gone too far to be remedied; but I feel little doubt in my own mind, that if the poor-laws had never exi&s;ted, though there might have been a few more in&s;tances of very &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s, yet that the aggregate ma&s;s of happine&s;s among the common people would have been much greater than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's Poor-bill has the appearance of being framed with benevolent inten|tions, and the clamour rai&s;ed again&s;t it was in many re&s;pects ill directed, and unrea&s;onable. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a high degree the great and radical defect of all &s;y&s;tems of the kind, that, of tending to increa&s;e population without increa&s;ing the means for its &s;upport, and thus to depre&s;s the condition of tho&s;e that are not &s;upported
<PB N="95" REF="111">
by pari&s;hes, and, con&s;equently, to create more poor.</P>
<P>To remove the wants of the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, is indeed an arduous ta&s;k. The truth is, that the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s on this part of a community is an evil &s;o deeply &s;eated, that no human ingenuity can reach it. Were I to pro|po&s;e a palliative; and palliatives are all that the nature of the ca&s;e will admit; it &s;hould be, in the fir&s;t place, the total abolition of all the pre&s;ent pari&s;h-laws. This would at any rate give liberty and freedom of action to the pea&s;antry of England, which they can hardly be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s at pre&s;ent. They would then be able to &s;ettle without interruption, wherever there was a pro&s;pect of a greater plenty of work, and a higher price for labour. The market of labour would then be free, and tho&s;e ob&s;tacles remov|ed,
<PB N="96" REF="112">
which as things are now, often for a con&s;iderable time prevent the price from ri&s;ing according to the demand.</P>
<P>Secondly, Premiums might be given for turning up fre&s;h land, and all po&s;sible encouragements held out to agriculture above manufactures, and to tillage above grazing. Every endeavour &s;hould be u&s;ed to weaken and de&s;troy all tho&s;e in&s;titu|tions relating to corporations, apprentice|&s;hips, &amp;c. which cau&s;e the labours of agriculture to be wor&s;e paid than the labours of trade and manufactures. For a country can never produce its proper quantity of food while the&s;e di&s;tinctions remain in favour of artizans. Such en|couragements to agriculture would tend to furni&s;h the market with an increa&s;ing quantity of healthy work, and at the &s;ame time, by augmenting the produce of the country, would rai&s;e the compara|tive

<P>New colonies.&mdash;Rea&s;ons of their rapid increa&s;e.&mdash;North American Colonies.&mdash;Extraordinary in&s;tance of increa&s;e in the back &s;ettlements.&mdash;Rapidity with which even old &s;tates recover the ravages of war, pe&s;tilence, famine, or the convul&s;ions of nature.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been univer&s;ally remarked, that all new colonies &s;ettled in healthy coun|tries, where there was plenty of room and food, have con&s;tantly increa&s;ed with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity in their population. Some of the colonies from ancient Greece, in no very long period, more than equalled their parent &s;tates in numbers and &s;trength. And not to dwell on re|mote in&s;tances, the European &s;ettle|ments in the new world bear ample te&s;timony to the truth of a remark, which, indeed, has never, that I know of, been doubted. A plenty of rich land,
<PB N="102" REF="118">
to be had for little or nothing, is &s;o powerful a cau&s;e of population, as to overcome all other ob&s;tacles. No &s;ettle|ments could well have been wor&s;e ma|naged than tho&s;e of Spain in Mexico, Peru, and Quito. The tyranny, &s;uper&s;ti|tion, and vices, of the mother-country, were introduced in ample quantities among her children. Exorbitant taxes were exacted by the Crown. The mo&s;t ar|bitrary re&s;trictions were impo&s;ed on their trade. And the governors were not be|hind hand in rapacity and extortion for them&s;elves as well as their ma&s;ter. Yet, under all the&s;e difficulties, the colonies made a quick progre&s;s in population. The city of Lima, founded &s;ince the conque&s;t, is repre&s;ented by Ulloa as containing fifty thou&s;and inhabitants near fifty years ago. Quito, which had been but a hamlet of Indians, is re|pre&s;ented by the &s;ame author as in his
<PB N="103" REF="119">
time equally populous. Mexico is &s;aid to contain a hundred thou&s;and inha|bitants, which, notwith&s;tanding the ex|aggerations of the Spani&s;h writers, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be five times greater than what it contained in the time of Mon|tezuma.</P>
<P>In the Portugue&s;e colony of Bra&s;il, governed with almo&s;t equal tyranny, there were &s;uppo&s;ed to be, thirty years &s;ince, &s;ix hundred thou&s;and inhabitants of European extraction.</P>
<P>The Dutch and French colonies, though under the government of exclu&s;ive com|panies of merchants, which, as Dr. Adam Smith &s;ays very ju&s;tly, is the wor&s;t of all po&s;sible governments, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in thriving under every di&s;ad|vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="120">
But the Engli&s;h North American co|lonies, now, the powerful People of the United States of America, made by far the mo&s;t rapid progre&s;s. To the plenty of good land which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in com|mon with the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements, they added a greater de|gree of liberty and equality. Though not without &s;ome re&s;trictions on their foreign commerce, they were allowed a perfect liberty of managing their own internal affairs. The political in&s;ti|tutions that prevailed were favoura|ble to the alienation and divi&s;ion of property. Lands that were not cul|tivated by the proprietor within a li|mited time, were declared grantable to any other per&s;on. In Pen&s;ylvania there was no right of primogeniture; and in the provinces of New England, the elde&s;t had only a double &s;hare. There were no tythes in any of the States, and
<PB N="105" REF="121">
&s;carcely any taxes. And on account of the extreme cheapne&s;s of good land, a capital could not be more advan|tageou&s;ly employed than in agricul|ture, which at the &s;ame time that it &s;upplies the greate&s;t quantity of healthy work, affords much the mo&s;t valuable produce to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of the&s;e favourable circum&s;tances united, was a rapidity of increa&s;e, probably without parallel in hi&s;|tory. Throughout all the northern colo|nies, the population was found to dou|ble it&s;elf in 25 years. The original num|ber of per&s;ons who had &s;ettled in the four provinces of new England in 1643, was 21,200 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I take the&s;e facts from Dr. Prince's two volumes of Ob&s;ervations, not having Dr. Styles's pamphlet, from which he quotes, by me.</NOTE>. Afterwards, it is &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="106" REF="122">
that more left them, than went to them. In the year 1760, they were increa&s;ed to half a million. They had therefore all along doubled their own number in 25 years. In new Jer&s;ey the period of doubling appeared to be 22 years; and in Rhode I&s;land &s;till le&s;s. In the back &s;ettlements, where the inhabitants ap|plied them&s;elves &s;olely to agriculture, and luxury was not known, they were found to double their own number in 15 years, a mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tance of increa&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In in&s;tances of this kind, the powers of the earth appear to be fully equal to an&s;wer all the de|mands for food that can be made upon it by man. But we &s;hould be led into an error, if we were thence to &s;uppo&s;e that population and food ever really increa&s;e in the &s;ame ratio. The one is &s;till a geometrical and the other an arithmetical ratio, that is, one increa&s;es by multiplication, and the other by addition. Where there are few people, and a great quantity of fertile land, the power of the earth to afford a yearly increa&s;e of food may be compared to a great re&s;ervoir of water, &s;upplied by a moderate &s;tream. The fa&s;ter population increa&s;es, the more help will be got to draw off the water, and con&s;equently an increa&s;ing quantity will be taken every year. But the &s;ooner, undoubtedly, will the re&s;ervoir be exhau&s;ted, and the &s;treams only remain. When acre has been added to acre, till all the fertile land is occupied, the yearly increa&s;e of food will depend upon the amelioration of the land al|ready in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and even this moderate &s;tream will be gradually dimini&s;hing. But population, could it be &s;upplied with food, would go on with unex|hau&s;ted vigour, and the increa&s;e of one period would furni&s;h the power of a greater increa&s;e the next, and this without any limit.</NOTE>. Along the &s;ea coa&s;t, which
<PB N="107" REF="123">
would naturally be fir&s;t inhabited, the period of doubling was about 35 years; and in &s;ome of the maritime towns, the population was ab&s;olutely at a &s;tand.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts &s;eem to &s;hew that popula|tion increa&s;es exactly in the proportion, that the two great checks to it, mi&s;ery
<PB N="108" REF="124">
and vice, are removed; and that there is not a truer criterion of the happine&s;s and innocence of a people, than the ra|pidity of their increa&s;e. The unwhole|&s;omene&s;s of towns, to which &s;ome per|&s;ons are nece&s;&s;arily driven, from the na|ture of their trades, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of mi&s;ery; and every the &s;lighte&s;t check to marriage, from a pro&s;|pect of the difficulty of maintaining a family, may be fairly cla&s;&s;ed under the &s;ame head. In &s;hort, it is difficult to conceive any check to population, which does not come under the de&s;cription of &s;ome &s;pecies of mi&s;ery or vice.</P>
<P>The population of the thirteen Ameri|can States before the war, was reckoned at about three millions. Nobody imagines, that Great Britain is le&s;s populous at pre|&s;ent for the emigration of the &s;mall pa|rent &s;tock that produced the&s;e numbers.
<PB N="109" REF="125">
On the contrary, a certain degree of emi|gration, is known to be favourable to the population of the mother country. It has been particularly remarked, that the two Spani&s;h provinces from which the greate&s;t number of people emigrated to America, became in con&s;equence more populous. Whatever was the original number of Briti&s;h Emigrants that in|crea&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t in the North American Colonies; let us a&s;k, why does not an equal number produce an equal increa&s;e, in the &s;ame time, in Great Britain? The great and obvious cau&s;e to be a&s;signed, is, the want of room and food, or, in other words, mi&s;ery; and that this is a much more powerful cau&s;e even than vice, appears &s;ufficiently evident from the rapidity with which even old States recover the de&s;olations of war, pe&s;tilence, or the accidents of nature. They are then for a &s;hort time placed a little in
<PB N="110" REF="126">
the &s;ituation of new &s;tates; and the ef|fect is always an&s;werable to what might be expected. If the indu&s;try of the in|habitants be not de&s;troyed by &s;ear or ty|ranny, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence will &s;oon increa&s;e be|yond the wants of the reduced numbers; and the invariable con&s;equence will be, that population which before, perhaps, was nearly &s;tationary, will begin imme|diately to increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The fertile province of Flanders, which has been &s;o often the &s;eat of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive wars, after a re&s;pite of a few years, has appeared always as fruitful and as populous as ever. Even the Pa|latinate lifted up its head again after the execrable ravages of Lewis the Four|teenth. The effects of the dreadful plague in London in 1666, were not percep|tible 15 or 20 years afterwards. The traces of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive famines in
<PB N="111" REF="127">
China and Indo&s;tan, are by all accounts very &s;oon obliterated. It may even be doubted whether Turkey and Egypt are upon an average much le&s;s populous, for the plagues that periodically lay them wa&s;te. If the number of people which they contain be le&s;s now than formerly, it is, probably, rather to be attributed to the tyranny and oppre&s;sion of the govern|ment under which they groan, and the con&s;equent di&s;couragements to agricul|ture, than to the lo&s;s which they &s;u&s;|tain by the plague. The mo&s;t tremen|dous convul&s;ions of nature, &s;uch as vol|canic eruptions and earthquakes, if they do not happen &s;o frequently as to drive away the inhabitants, or to de&s;troy their &s;pirit of indu&s;try, have but a trifling effect on the average population of any &s;tate. Naples, and the country under Ve&s;uvius, are &s;till very populous, not|with&s;tanding the repeated eruptions of that

Is it not probable, that in this ca&s;e, the number of inhabitants had increa&s;ed fa&s;ter than the food and the accommoda|tions nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve them in health. The ma&s;s of the people would, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, be obliged to live harder, and a greater number would be crouded together in one hou&s;e; and it is not &s;urely improbable, that the&s;e were among the na|tural cau&s;es that produced the three &s;ickly years. The&s;e cau&s;es may produce &s;uch an effect, though the country, ab&s;olutely con&s;idered, may not be extremely crowded and populous. In a country even thinly inhabited, if an increa&s;e of population take place, before more food is rai&s;ed, and more hou&s;es are built, the inhabi|tants mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome degree for room and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

<P>For further information on this &s;ub|ject, I refer the reader to Mr. Su&s;milch's tables. The extracts that I have made are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the periodical, though irregular returns of &s;ickly &s;ea|&s;ons; and it &s;eems highly probable, that a &s;cantine&s;s of room and food was one of the principal cau&s;es that occa&s;ioned them.</P>
<P>It appears from the tables, that the&s;e countries were increa&s;ing rather fa&s;t for old &s;tates, notwith&s;tanding the occa&s;ional &s;ickly &s;ea&s;ons that prevailed. Cultiva|tion mu&s;t have been improving, and marriages, con&s;equently, encouraged. For the checks to population appear to have been rather of the po&s;itive, than of the preventive kind. When from a pro&s;pect

of increa&s;ing plenty in any country, the weight that repre&s;&s;es population is in &s;ome degree removed; it is highly probable that the motion will be con|tinued beyond the operation of the cau&s;e that fir&s;t impelled it. Or, to be more particular, when the increa&s;ing produce of a country, and the increa&s;ing demand for labour, &s;o far ameliorate the condi|tion of the labourer, as greatly to en|courage marriage, it is probable that the cu&s;tom of early marriages will con|tinue, till the population of the coun|try has gone beyond the increa&s;ed pro|duce: and &s;ickly &s;ea&s;ons appear to be the natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence.

population could more completely ac|commodate it&s;elf to the average pro|duce.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervation the conver&s;e of this will probably al&s;o be found true. In tho&s;e countries that are &s;ubject to pe|riodical &s;ickne&s;&s;es, the increa&s;e of popu|lation, or the exce&s;s of births above the burials, will be greater in the intervals of the&s;e periods, than is u&s;ual, caeteris paribus, in the countries not &s;o much &s;ubject to &s;uch di&s;orders. If Turkey and Egypt have been nearly &s;tationary in their average population for the la&s;t century, in the intervals of their perio|dical plagues, the births mu&s;t have ex|ceeded the burials in a greater propor|tion than in &s;uch countries as France and England.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137">
The average proportion of births to burials in any country for a period of five or ten years, will hence appear to be a very inadequate criterion by which to judge of its real progre&s;s in popu|lation. This proportion certainly &s;hews the rate of increa&s;e during tho&s;e five or ten years; but we can by no means thence infer, what had been the in|crea&s;e for the twenty years before, or what would be the increa&s;e for the twenty years after. Dr. Price ob&s;erves, that Sweden, Norway, Ru&s;sia, and the kingdom of Naples, are increa&s;ing fa&s;t; but the extracts from regi&s;ters that he has given, are not for periods of &s;ufficient extent to e&s;tabli&s;h the fact. It is highly probable, however, that Sweden, Norway, and Ru&s;sia, are really increa&s;ing in their population, though not at the rate that the proportion of births to burials for the &s;hort periods that Dr. Price takes

<P>Dr. Short compared the regi&s;ters of many villages and market towns in Eng|land for two periods; the fir&s;t, from Queen Elizabeth to the middle of the la&s;t century, and the &s;econd, from dif|ferent years at the end of the la&s;t cen|tury, to the middle of the pre&s;ent. And from a compari&s;on of the&s;e ex|tracts, it appears, that in the former pe|riod
<PB N="123" REF="139">
the births exceeded the burials in the proportion of 124 to 100; but in the latter, only in the proportion of 111 to 100. Dr. Price thinks that the regi&s;ters in the former period are not to be depended upon; but, probably, in this in&s;tance, they do not give incor|rect proportions. At lea&s;t, there are many rea&s;ons for expecting to find a greater exce&s;s of births above the burials in the former period than in the latter. In the natural progre&s;s of the popula|tion of any country, more good land will, caeteris paribus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay caeteris paribus, becau&s;e the increa&s;e of the produce of any country will always very greatly de|pend on the &s;pirit of indu&s;try that prevails, and the way in which it is directed.

<PB N="124" REF="140">
in the later. And a greater propor|tional yearly increa&s;e of produce, will almo&s;t invariably be followed by a greater proportional increa&s;e of population. But, be&s;ides this great cau&s;e, which would naturally give the exce&s;s of births above the burials greater at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, than in the middle of the pre&s;ent century, I cannot help thinking that the occa&s;ional ravages of the plague in the former period, mu&s;t have had &s;ome tendency to increa&s;e this proportion. If an average of ten years had been taken in the intervals of the returns of this dreadful di&s;order; or if the years of plague had been re|jected as accidental, the regi&s;ters would certainly give the proportion of births to burials too high for the real average increa&s;e of the population. For &s;ome few years after the great plague in 1666, it is probable that there was a
<PB N="125" REF="141">
more than u&s;ual exce&s;s of births above burials, particularly if Dr. Price's opi|nion be founded, that England was more populous at the revolution (which hap|pened only 22 years afterwards) than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mr. King, in 1693, &s;tated the pro|portion of the births to the burials throughout the Kingdom, exclu&s;ive of London, as 115 to 100. Dr. Short makes it, in the middle of the pre&s;ent century, 111 to 100, including Lon|don. The proportion in France for five years, ending in 1774, was 117 to 100. If the&s;e &s;tatements are near the truth; and if there are no very great va|riations at particular periods in the pro|portions, it would appear, that the po|pulation of France and England has ac|commodated it&s;elf very nearly to the average produce of each country. The
<PB N="126" REF="142">
di&s;couragements to marriage, the con&s;e|quent vicious habits, war, luxury, the &s;ilent though certain depopulation of large towns, and the clo&s;e habitations, and in&s;ufficient food of many of the poor, prevent population from increa&s;ing beyond the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and, if I may u&s;e an expre&s;sion which cer|tainly at fir&s;t appears &s;trange, &s;upercede the nece&s;sity of great and ravaging epi|demics to repre&s;s what is redundant. Were a wa&s;ting plague to &s;weep off two millions in England, and &s;ix mil|lions in France, there can be no doubt whatever, that after the inhabitants had recovered from the dreadful &s;hock, the proportion of births to burials would be much above what it is in either country at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In New Jer&s;ey, the proportion of births to deaths on an average of &s;even
<PB N="127" REF="143">
years, ending in 1743, was as 300 to 100. In France and England, taking the highe&s;t proportion, it is as 117 to 100. Great and a&s;toni&s;hing as this dif|ference is, we ought not to be &s;o wonder|&s;truck at it, as to attribute it to the miraculous interpo&s;ition of heaven. The cau&s;es of it are not remote, latent and my&s;terious; but near us, round about us, and open to the inve&s;tigation of every inquiring mind. It accords with the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, to &s;uppo&s;e that not a &s;tone can fall, or a plant ri&s;e, without the immediate agency of divine power. But we know from experience, that the&s;e operations of what we call nature have been conducted al|mo&s;t invariably according to fixed laws. And &s;ince the world began, the cau&s;es of population and depopulation have pro|bably been as con&s;tant as any of the
<PB N="128" REF="144">
laws of nature with which we are ac|quainted.</P>
<P>The pa&s;sion between the &s;exes has appeared in every age to be &s;o nearly the &s;ame, that it may always be con|&s;idered, in algebraic language, as a given quantity. The great law of nece&s;sity which prevents population from increa&s;|ing in any country beyond the food which it can either produce or acquire, is a law, &s;o open to our view, &s;o ob|vious and evident to our under&s;tandings, and &s;o completely confirmed by the ex|perience of every age, that we cannot for a moment doubt it. The different modes which nature takes to prevent, or repre&s;s a redundant population, do not appear, indeed, to us &s;o certain and regular; but, though we cannot always predict the mode, we may with cer|tainty predict the fact. If the propor|tion
<PB N="129" REF="145">
of births to deaths for a few years, indicate an increa&s;e of numbers much beyond the proportional increa&s;ed or acquired produce of the country, we may be perfectly certain, that unle&s;s an emi|gration takes place, the deaths will &s;hortly exceed the births; and that the increa&s;e that had taken place for a few years cannot be the real average increa&s;e of the population of the country. Were there no other depopulating cau&s;es, every country would, without doubt, be &s;ubject to periodical pe&s;tilences or fa|mines.</P>
<P>The only true criterion of a real and permanent increa&s;e in the popu|lation of any country, is the increa&s;e of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But even this criterion is &s;ubject to &s;ome &s;light variations, which are, however, com|pletely open to our view and ob&s;erva|tions.
<PB N="130" REF="146">
In &s;ome countries population appears to have been forced; that is, the people have been habituated by de|grees to live almo&s;t upon the &s;malle&s;t po&s;sible quantity of food. There mu&s;t have been periods in &s;uch countries when population increa&s;ed permanently, without an increa&s;e in the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. China &s;eems to an&s;wer to this de&s;cription. If the accounts we have of it are to be tru&s;ted, the lower cla&s;&s;es of people are in the habit of living almo&s;t upon the &s;malle&s;t po&s;sible quantity of food, and are glad to get any putrid offals that European la|bourers would rather &s;tarve than eat. The law in China which permits pa|rents to expo&s;e their children, has tended principally thus to force the population. A nation in this &s;tate mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ubject to famines. Where a country is &s;o populous in proportion to the
<PB N="131" REF="147">
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, that the average produce of it is but barely &s;ufficient to &s;upport the lives of the inhabitants, any deficiency from the badne&s;s of &s;ea|&s;ons mu&s;t be fatal. It is probable that the very frugal manner in which the Gentoos are in the habit of living, con|tributes in &s;ome degree to the famines of Indo&s;tan.</P>
<P>In America, where the reward of la|bour is at pre&s;ent &s;o liberal, the lower cla&s;&s;es might retrench very con&s;iderably in a year of &s;carcity, without materially di&s;tre&s;sing them&s;elves. A famine there|fore &s;eems to be almo&s;t impo&s;sible. It may be expected, that in the progre&s;s of the population of America, the la|bourers will in time be much le&s;s liber|ally rewarded. The numbers will in this ca&s;e permanently increa&s;e, without a

proportional increa&s;e in the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In the different States of Europe there mu&s;t be &s;ome variations in the propor|tion between the number of inhabitants, and the quantity of food con&s;umed, ari&s;|ing from the different habits of living that prevail in each State. The labourers of the South of England are &s;o accu&s;|tomed to eat fine wheaten bread, that they will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be half &s;tarved, before they will &s;ubmit to live like the Scotch pea&s;ants. They might perhaps in time, by the con&s;tant opera|tion of the hard law of nece&s;sity, be reduced to live even like the lower Chine&s;e: and the country would then, with the &s;ame quantity of food, &s;upport a greater population. But to effect this mu&s;t always be a mo&s;t difficult, and
<PB N="133" REF="149">
every friend to humanity will hope, an abortive attempt. Nothing is &s;o com|mon as to hear of encouragements that ought to be given to population. If the tendency of mankind to increa&s;e be &s;o great as I have repre&s;ented it to be, it may appear &s;trange that this increa&s;e does not come when it is thus repeatedly called for. The true rea&s;on is, that the demand for a greater population is made without preparing the funds nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it. Increa&s;e the demand for agricultural labour by promoting culti|vation, and with it con&s;equently in|crea&s;e the produce of the country, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer, and no apprehen&s;ions whatever need be entertained of the proportional increa&s;e of population. An attempt to effect this purpo&s;e in any other way is vicious, cruel, and tyrannical, and in any &s;tate of tolerable freedom cannot therefore &s;uc|ceed.
<PB N="134" REF="150">
It may appear to be the intere&s;t of the rulers, and the rich of a State, to force population, and thereby lower the price of labour, and con&s;equently the expence of fleets and armies, and the co&s;t of manufactures for foreign &s;ale: but every attempt of the kind &s;hould be carefully watched and &s;trenuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted by the friends of the poor, particularly when it comes under the deceitful garb of benevolence, and is likely, on that account, to be cheerfully, and cordially received by the common people.</P>
<P>I entirely acquit Mr. Pitt of any &s;ini&s;ter intention in that clau&s;e of his poor bill which allows a &s;hilling a week to every labourer for each child he has above three. I confe&s;s, that before the bill was brought into Parliament, and for &s;ome time after, I thought that &s;uch a regulation would be highly beneficial;
<PB N="135" REF="151">
but further reflection on the &s;ubject has convinced me, that if its object be to better the condition of the poor, it is calculated to defeat the very purpo&s;e which it has in view. It has no ten|dency that I can di&s;cover to increa&s;e the produce of the country; and if it tend to increa&s;e population, without in|crea&s;ing the produce, the nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable con&s;equence appears to be, that the &s;ame produce mu&s;t be divided among a greater number, and con&s;e|quently that a day's labour will pur|cha&s;e a &s;maller quantity of provi&s;ions, and the poor therefore in general mu&s;t be more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have mentioned &s;ome ca&s;es, where population may permanently increa&s;e, without a proportional increa&s;e in the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But it is evident that the variation in different States,
<PB N="136" REF="152">
between the food and the numbers &s;up|ported by it, is re&s;tricted to a limit be|yond which it cannot pa&s;s. In every country, the population of which is not ab&s;olutely decrea&s;ing, the food mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily &s;ufficient to &s;upport, and to continue, the race of labourers.</P>
<P>Other circum&s;tances being the &s;ame, it may be affirmed, that countries are populous, according to the quantity of human food which they produce; and happy, according to the liberality with which that food is divided, or the quan|tity which a day's labour will purcha&s;e. Corn countries are more populous than pa&s;ture countries; and rice countries more populous than corn countries. The lands in England are not &s;uited to rice, but they would all bear potatoes: and Dr. Adam Smith ob&s;erves, that if pota|toes were to become the favourite vegeta|ble
<PB N="137" REF="153">
food of the common people, and if the &s;ame quantity of land was employed in their culture, as is now employed in the culture of corn, the country would be able to &s;upport a much greater population; and would con&s;equently in a very &s;hort time have it.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of a country does not depend, ab&s;olutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increa&s;ing, upon the degree in which the yearly increa&s;e of food approaches to the yearly increa&s;e of an unre&s;ricted population. This approximation is al|ways the neare&s;t in new colonies, where the knowledge and indu&s;try of an old State, operate on the fertile unappro|priated land of a new one. In other ca&s;es, the youth or the age of a State is not in
<PB N="138" REF="154">
this re&s;pect of very great importance. It is probable, that the food of Great Britain is divided in as great plenty to the inhabitants, at the pre&s;ent period, as it was two thou&s;and, three thou&s;and, or four thou&s;and years ago. And there is rea&s;on to believe that the poor and thinly inhabited tracts of the Scotch Highlands, are as much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by an overcharged population, as the rich and populous pro|vince of Flanders.</P>
<P>Were a country never to be over-run by a people more advanced in arts, but left to its own natural progre&s;s in civiliza|tion; from the time that its produce might be con&s;idered as an unit, to the time that it might be con&s;idered as a million, during the lap&s;e of many hun|dred years, there would not be a &s;ingle period, when the ma&s;s of the people
<PB N="139" REF="155">
could be &s;aid to be free from di&s;tre&s;s, either directly or indirectly, for want of food. In every State in Europe, &s;ince we have fir&s;t had accounts of it, millions and millions of human exi&s;tences have been repre&s;&s;ed from this &s;imple cau&s;e; though perhaps in &s;ome of the&s;e States, an ab&s;olute famine has never been known.</P>
<P>Famine &s;eems to be the la&s;t, the mo&s;t dreadful re&s;ource of nature.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TO a per&s;on who draws the preceding obvious inferences, from a view of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, it cannot but be a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that all the writers on the perfectibility of man and of &s;ociety, who have noticed the ar|gument of an overcharged population, treat it always very &s;lightly, and inva|riably repre&s;ent the difficulties ari&s;ing from it, as at a great and almo&s;t immea|&s;urable di&s;tance. Even Mr. Wallace, who thought the argument it&s;elf of &s;o much weight, as to de&s;troy his whole &s;y&s;tem of equality, did not &s;eem to be aware that any

difficulty would occur from this cau&s;e, till the whole earth had been cultivated like a garden, and was incapable of any further increa&s;e of produce. Were this really the ca&s;e, and were a beautiful &s;y&s;tem of equality in other re&s;pects prac|ticable, I cannot think that our ardour in the pur&s;uit of &s;uch a &s;cheme ought to be damped by the contemplation of &s;o re|mote a difficulty. An event at &s;uch a di&s;tance might fairly be left to provi|dence: but the truth is, that if the view of the argument given in this e&s;&s;ay be ju&s;t, the difficulty &s;o far from being remote, would be imminent, and imme|diate. At every period during the pro|gre&s;s of cultivation, from the pre&s;ent moment, to the time when the whole earth was become like a garden, the di&s;tre&s;s for want of food would be con|&s;tantly pre&s;sing on all mankind, if they were equal. Though the produce of the

Condorcet allows, that a cla&s;s of people, which maintains it&s;elf entirely by in|du&s;try, is nece&s;&s;ary to every &s;tate. Why does he allows this? No other rea&s;on can well be a&s;signed, than that he conceives that the labour nece&s;&s;ary to procure &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for an extended population, will not be performed without the goad of nece&s;sity. If by e&s;tabli&s;hments of this kind, this &s;pur to indu&s;try be removed, if the idle and the negligent are placed upon the &s;ame footing with regard to their credit, and the future &s;upport of their wives and families, as the active and indu&s;trious; can we expect to &s;ee men exert that animated activity in bettering their condition, which now forms the ma&s;ter &s;pring of public pro&s;|perity.

<P>But independent of this great objec|tion to the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;uppo|&s;ing for a moment, that they would give no check to productive indu&s;try, by far the greate&s;t difficulty remains yet behind.</P>

<P>Mr. Condorcet's picture of what may be expected to happen when the number of men &s;hall &s;urpa&s;s the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is ju&s;tly drawn. The o&s;cilla|tion which he de&s;cribes, will certainly take place, and will, without doubt, be a con&s;tantly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting cau&s;e of perio|dical mi&s;ery. The only point in which I differ from Mr. Condorcet with regard
<PB N="153" REF="169">
to this picture, is, the period, when it may be applied to the human race. Mr. Condorcet thinks, that it cannot po&s;si|bly be applicable, but at an aera ex|tremely di&s;tant. If the proportion be|tween the natural increa&s;e of popula|lation and food, which I have given, be in any degree near the truth, it will appear, on the contrary, that the period when the number of men &s;urpa&s;s their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, has long &s;ince arrived; and that this nece&s;&s;ary o&s;cillation, this con&s;tantly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting cau&s;e of periodical mi&s;ery, has exi&s;ted ever &s;ince we have had any hi&s;tories of mankind, does exi&s;t at pre&s;ent, and will for ever continue to exi&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome decided change take place, in the phy|&s;ical con&s;titution of our nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Condorcet, however, goes on to &s;ay, that &s;hould the period, which he

conceives to be &s;o di&s;tant, ever arrive, the human race, and the advocates for the perfectibility of man, need not be alarmed at it. He then proceeds to re|move the difficulty in a manner, which I profe&s;s not to under&s;tand. Having ob|&s;erved, that the ridiculous prejudices of &s;uper&s;tition, would by that time have cea&s;ed to throw over morals, a corrupt and degrading au&s;terity, he alludes, ei|ther to a promi&s;cuous concubinage, which would prevent breeding, or to &s;omething el&s;e as unnatural. To remove the diffi|culty in this way, will, &s;urely, in the opinion of mo&s;t men, be, to de&s;troy that virtue, and purity of manners, which the advocates of equality, and of the per|fectibility of man, profe&s;s to be the end and object of their views.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Condorcet's conjecture concerning the organic per|fectibility of man, and the indefinite prolongation of human life.&mdash;Fallacy of the argument, which infers an unlimited progre&s;s from a partial improvement, the limit of which cannot be a&s;certained, illu&s;trated in the breeding of animals, and the cultivation of plants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE la&s;t que&s;tion which Mr. Condorcet propo&s;es for examination, is, the organic perfectibility of man. He ob&s;erves, that if the proofs which have been already given, and which, in their development will receive greater force in the work it|&s;elf, are &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the indefi|nite perfectibility of man, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition, of the &s;ame natural faculties, and the &s;ame organization which he has at pre&s;ent; what will be the certainty, what the extent of our hope, if this organization, the&s;e natural faculties
<PB N="156" REF="172">
them&s;elves, are &s;u&s;ceptible of ameliora|tion?</P>
<P>From the improvement of medicine; from the u&s;e of more whole&s;ome food, and habitations; from a manner of liv|ing, which will improve the &s;trength of the body by exerci&s;e, without impairing it by exce&s;s; from the de&s;truction of the two great cau&s;es of the degradation of man, mi&s;ery, and too great riches; from the gradual removal of tran&s;mi&s;sible and contagious di&s;orders, by the improvement of phy&s;ical knowledge, rendered more efficacious, by the progre&s;s of rea&s;on and of &s;ocial order; he infers, that though man will not ab&s;olutely become immor|tal, yet that the duration between his birth, and naural death, will increa&s;e without cea&s;ing, will have no a&s;signable term, and may properly be expre&s;&s;ed by the word indefinite. He then defines
<PB N="157" REF="173">
this word to mean, either a con&s;tant ap|proach to an unlimited extent, without ever reaching it; or, an increa&s;e in the im|men&s;ity of ages to an extent greater than any a&s;signable quantity.</P>
<P>But &s;urely the application of this term in either of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, to the duration of human life, is in the highe&s;t degree unphilo&s;ophical, and totally unwarranted by any appearances in the laws of na|ture. Variations from different cau&s;es are e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct from a regular and unre|trograde increa&s;e. The average duration of human life will, to a certain degree, vary, from healthy or unhealthy climates, from whole&s;ome or unwhole&s;ome food, from virtuous or vicious manners, and other cau&s;es; but it may be fairly doubted, whether there is really the &s;malle&s;t per|ceptible advance in the natural duration of human life, &s;ince fir&s;t we have had
<PB N="158" REF="174">
any authentic hi&s;tory of man. The pre|judices of all ages have indeed been di|rectly contrary to this &s;uppo&s;ition, and though I would not lay much &s;tre&s;s upon the&s;e prejudices, they will in &s;ome mea|&s;ure tend to prove, that there has been no marked advance in an oppo&s;ite di|rection.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be &s;aid, that the world is yet &s;o young, &s;o completely in its in|fancy, that it ought not to be expected that any difference &s;hould appear &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>If this be the ca&s;e, there is at once an end of all human &s;cience. The whole train of rea&s;onings from effects to cau&s;es will be de&s;troyed. We may &s;hut our eyes to the book of nature, as it will no longer be of any u&s;e to read it. The wilde&s;t and mo&s;t improbable conjectures may be advanced with as much certainty
<PB N="159" REF="175">
as the mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;ublime theories, founded on careful and reiterated experi|ments. We may return again to the old mode of philo&s;ophizing, and make facts bend to &s;y&s;tems, in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;y&s;tems upon facts. The grand and con|&s;i&s;tent theory of Newton, will be placed upon the &s;ame footing as the wild and excentric hypothe&s;es of De&s;cartes. In &s;hort, if the laws of nature are thus fickle and incon&s;tant; if it can be affirmed, and be believed, that they will change, when for ages and ages they have ap|peared immutable, the human mind will no longer have any incitements to in|quiry, but mu&s;t remain fixed in inactive torpor, or amu&s;e it&s;elf only in bewilder|ing dreams, and extravagant fancies.</P>
<P>The con&s;tancy of the laws of nature, and of effects and cau&s;es, is the founda|tion of all human knowledge; though
<PB N="160" REF="176">
far be it from me to &s;ay, that the &s;ame power which framed and executes the laws of nature, may not change them all <Q>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.</Q> Such a change may undoubtedly happen. All that I mean to &s;ay is, that it is impo&s;sible to infer it from rea|&s;oning. If without any previous ob&s;erva|ble &s;ymptoms or indications of a change, we can infer that a change will take place, we may as well make any a&s;&s;er|tion whatever, and think it as unrea&s;on|able to be contradicted, in affirming that the moon will come in contact with the earth to-morrow, as in &s;aying, that the &s;un will ri&s;e at its u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>With regard to the duration of human life, there does not appear to have exi&s;t|ed, from the earlie&s;t ages of the world, to the pre&s;ent moment, the &s;malle&s;t permanent &s;ymptom, or indication, of in|crea&s;ing

I profe&s;s, however, to be of a different opinion. When paradoxes of this kind are advanced by ingenious and able men, neglect has no tendency to convince them of their mi&s;takes.

<P>On the contrary, a candid inve&s;tigation of the&s;e &s;ubjects, accompanied with a perfect readine&s;s to adopt any theory, warranted by &s;ound philo&s;ophy, may have a tendency to convince them, that in form|ing improbable and unfounded hypothe&s;es, &s;o far from enlarging the bounds of human &s;cience, they are con|tracting it; &s;o far from promoting the improvement of the human mind, they are ob&s;tructing it: they are throwing us back again almo&s;t into the infancy of knowledge; and weakening the foundations of that mode of philo&s;ophi&s;ing, under the au&s;pices of which, &s;cience has of late made &s;uch rapid advances. The pre&s;ent rage for wide and unre&s;trained &s;peculation, &s;eems to be a kind of mental intoxication, ari&s;ing, perhaps, from the great and unexpected di&s;coveries which have been made of late years, in various branches of &s;cience. To men elate, and giddy with &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, every thing appeared to be within the gra&s;p of human powers; and, under this illu&s;ion, they con|founded &s;ubjects where no real progre&s;s could be proved, with tho&s;e, where the progre&s;s had been marked, certain, and acknowledged. Could they be per&s;uaded to &s;ober them&s;elves with a little &s;evere and cha&s;tized thinking, they would &s;ee, that the cau&s;e of truth, and of &s;ound philo&s;ophy, cannot but &s;uffer by &s;ub|&s;tituting wild flights and un&s;upported a&s;&s;ertions, for patient inve&s;tigation, and well authenticated proofs.</P></NOTE> The ob&s;ervable effects of climate, habit, diet, and other
<PB N="162" REF="178">
cau&s;es, on length of life, have furni&s;hed the pretext for a&s;&s;erting its indefinite ex|ten&s;ion; and the &s;andy foundation on
<PB N="163" REF="179">
which the argument re&s;ts, is, that be|cau&s;e the limit of human life is unde|fined; becau&s;e you cannot mark its pre|ci&s;e term, and &s;ay &s;o far exactly &s;hall it go and no further; that therefore its ex|tent may increa&s;e for ever, and be properly termed, indefinite or unlimited. But the fallacy and ab&s;urdity of this argument will &s;ufficiently appear from a &s;light exa|mination of what Mr. Condorcet calls the organic perfectibility, or degeneration, of the race of plants and animals, which he &s;ays may be regarded as one of the general laws of nature.</P>
<P>I am told that it is a maxim among the improvers of cattle, that you may breed to any degree of nicety you plea&s;e, and they found this maxim upon ano|ther, which is, that &s;ome of the offspring will po&s;&s;e&s;s the de&s;irable qualities of the parents in a greater degree. In the
<PB N="164" REF="180">
famous Leice&s;ter&s;hire breed of &s;heep, the object is to procure them with &s;mall heads and &s;mall legs. Proceeding upon the&s;e breeding maxims, it is evident, that we might go on till the heads and legs were evane&s;cent quantities; but this is &s;o palpable an ab&s;urdity, that we may be quite &s;ure that the premi&s;es are not ju&s;t, and that there really is a limit, though we cannot &s;ee it, or &s;ay exactly where it is. In this ca&s;e, the point of the greate&s;t degree of improvement, or the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize of the head and legs, may be &s;aid to be undefined, but this is very different from unlimited, or from indefininite, in Mr. Condorcet's accepta|tion of the term. Though I may not be able, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, to mark the limit, at which further improvement will &s;top, I can very ea&s;ily mention a point at which it will not arrive. I &s;hould not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that were the breeding
<PB N="165" REF="181">
to continue for ever, the head and legs of the&s;e &s;heep would never be &s;o &s;mall as the head and legs of a rat.</P>
<P>It cannot be true, therefore, that among animals, &s;ome of the offspring will po&s;&s;e&s;s the de&s;irable qualities of the parents in a greater degree; or that animals are inde|finitely perfectible.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of a wild plant, to a beautiful garden flower, is perhaps more marked and &s;triking, than any thing that takes place among animals, yet even here, it would be the height of ab&s;ur|dity to a&s;&s;ert, that the progre&s;s was un|limited or indefinite. One of the mo&s;t obvious features of the improvement is the increa&s;e of &s;ize. The flower has grown gradually larger by cultivation. If the progre&s;s were really unlimited, it might be increa&s;ed ad infinitum; but
<PB N="166" REF="182">
this is &s;o gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity, that we may be quite &s;ure, that among plants, as well as among animals, there is a limit to im|provement, though we do not exactly know where it is. It is probable that the gardeners who contend for flower prizes have often applied &s;tronger dre&s;s|ing without &s;ucce&s;s. At the &s;ame time, it would be highly pre&s;umptuous in any man to &s;ay, that he had &s;een the fine&s;t carnation or anemone that could ever be made to grow. He might however a&s;&s;ert without the &s;malle&s;t chance of being contradicted by a future fact, that no carnation or anemone could ever by cultivation be increa&s;ed to the &s;ize of a large cabbage; and yet there are a&s;sign|able quantities much greater than a cab|bage. No man can &s;ay that he has &s;een the large&s;t ear of wheat, or the large&s;t oak that could ever grow; but he might ea&s;ily, and with perfect certainty, name a
<PB N="167" REF="183">
point of magnitude, at which they would not arrive. In all the&s;e ca&s;es therefore, a careful di&s;tinction &s;hould be made, between an unlimited progre&s;s, and a progre&s;s where the limit is merely unde|fined.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, perhaps, that the rea|&s;on why plants and animals cannot in|crea&s;e indefinitely in &s;ize, is, that they would fall by their own weight. I an|&s;wer, how do we know this but from experience? from experience of the de|gree of &s;trength with which the&s;e bodies are formed. I know that a carnation, long before it reached the &s;ize of a cab|bage, would not be &s;upported by its &s;talk; but I only know this from my experience of the weakne&s;s, and want of tenacity in the materials of a carnation &s;talk. There are many &s;ub&s;tances in na|ture
<PB N="168" REF="184">
of the &s;ame &s;ize that would &s;upport as large a head as a cabbage.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons of the mortality of plants are at pre&s;ent perfectly unknown to us. No man can &s;ay why &s;uch a plant is an|nual, another biennial, and another en|dures for ages. The whole affair in all the&s;e ca&s;es, in plants, animals, and in the human race, is an affair of experi|ence; and I only conclude that man is mortal, becau&s;e the invariable experi|ence of all ages has proved the mortality of tho&s;e materials of which his vi&s;ible body is made.</P>
<Q>What can we rea&s;on but from what we know.</Q>
<P>Sound philo&s;ophy will not autho|rize me to alter this opinion of the mortality of man on earth, till it can be clearly proved, that the human race has
<PB N="169" REF="185">
made, and is making, a decided progre&s;s towards an illimitable extent of life. And the chief rea&s;on why I adduced the two particular in&s;tances from animals and plants, was to expo&s;e, and illu&s;trate, if I could, the fallacy of that argument, which infers an unlimited progre&s;s, merely becau&s;e &s;ome partial improve|ment has taken place, and that the limit of this improvement cannot be preci&s;ely a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The capacity of improvement in plants and animals, to a certain degree, no per|&s;on can po&s;sibly doubt. A clear and de|cided progre&s;s has already been made; and yet, I think it appears, that it would be highly ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that this pro|gre&s;s has no limits. In human life, though there are great variations from different cau&s;es, it may be doubted, whether, &s;ince the world began, any
<PB N="170" REF="186">
organic improvement whatever in the human frame can be clearly a&s;certained. The foundations therefore, on which the arguments for the organic perfectibility of man re&s;t, are unu&s;ually weak, and can only be con&s;idered as mere conjec|tures. It does not, however, by any means, &s;eem impo&s;sible, that by an at|tention to breed, a certain degree of im|provement, &s;imilar to that among ani|mals, might take place among men. Whether intellect could be communicated may be a matter of doubt: but &s;ize, &s;trength, beauty, complexion, and per|haps even longevity are in a degree tran&s;|mi&s;sible. The error does not &s;eem to lie, in &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;mall degree of improve|ment po&s;sible, but in not di&s;criminating between a &s;mall improvement, the limit of which is undefined, and an improve|ment really unlimited. As the human race however could not be improved in
<PB N="171" REF="187">
this way, without condemning all the bad &s;pecimens to celibacy, it is not probable, that an attention to breed &s;hould ever become general; indeed, I know of no well-directed attempts of the kind, ex|cept in the ancient family of the Bicker|&s;taffs, who are &s;aid to have been very &s;ucce&s;sful in whitening the &s;kins, and increa&s;ing the height of their race by prudent marriages, particularly by that very judicious cro&s;s with Maud, the milk-maid, by which &s;ome capital de|fects in the con&s;titutions of the family were corrected.</P>
<P>It will not be nece&s;&s;ary, I think, in order more completely to &s;hew the im|probability of any approach in man towards immortality on earth, to urge the very great additional weight that an increa&s;e in the duration of life would give to the argument of population.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN reading Mr. Godwin's ingenious and able work on political ju&s;tice, it is im|po&s;sible not to be &s;truck with the &s;pi|rit and energy of his &s;tyle, the force and preci&s;ion of &s;ome of his rea&s;onings, the ardent tone of his thoughts, and par|ticularly with that impre&s;sive earne&s;t|ne&s;s of manner which gives an air of truth to the whole. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that he has not proceeded in his enquiries with the caution that &s;ound philo&s;ophy &s;eems to require. His conclu&s;ions are often un|warranted
<PB N="174" REF="190">
by his premi&s;es. He fails &s;ometimes in removing the objections which he him&s;elf brings forward. He relies too much on general and ab&s;tract propo&s;itions which will not admit of ap|plication. And his conjectures certainly far out&s;trip the mode&s;ty of nature.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of equality which Mr. Godwin propo&s;es, is, without doubt, by far the mo&s;t beautiful and engaging of any that has yet appeared. An amelio|ration of &s;ociety to be produced merely by rea&s;on and conviction, wears much more the promi&s;e of permanence, than any change effected and maintained by force. The unlimited exerci&s;e of private judgment, is a doctrine inexpre&s;sibly grand and captivating, and has a va&s;t &s;uperiority over tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems where every individual is in a manner the &s;lave of the public. The &s;ub&s;titution of bene|volence
<PB N="175" REF="191">
as the ma&s;ter-&s;pring, and mov|ing principle of &s;ociety, in&s;tead of &s;elf|love, is a con&s;ummation devoutly to be wi&s;hed. In &s;hort, it is impo&s;sible to contemplate the whole of this fair &s;tructure, without emotions of delight and admiration, accompanied with ardent longing for the period of its accompli&s;h|ment. But, alas! that moment can never arrive. The whole is little better than a dream, a beautiful phantom of the imagination. The&s;e <Q>gorgeous pa|laces</Q> of happine&s;s and immortality, the&s;e <Q>&s;olemn temples</Q> of truth and vir|tue will di&s;&s;olve, <Q>like the ba&s;ele&s;s fa|bric of a vi&s;ion,</Q> when we awaken to real life, and contemplate the true and genuine &s;ituation of man on earth.</P>

<P>The great error under which Mr. Godwin labours throughout his whole work, is, the attributing almo&s;t all the vices and mi&s;ery that are &s;een in civil &s;ociety to human in&s;titutions. Political regulations, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed admi|ni&s;tration of property, are with him

<P>Mr. Godwin, in his chapter on the benefits attendant on a &s;y&s;tem of equa|lity, &s;ays, <Q>The &s;pirit of oppre&s;sion, the &s;pirit of &s;ervility, and the &s;pirit of

The other vices of envy, malice, and revenge, are their in&s;eparable companions. In a &s;tate of &s;ociety, where men lived in the mid&s;t of plenty, and where all &s;hared alike the bounties of nature, the&s;e &s;entiments would inevitably expire. The narrow principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s would vani&s;h. No man being obliged to guard his little &s;tore, or provide with anxiety and pain for his re&s;tle&s;s wants, each would lo&s;e his individual exi&s;tence in the thought of the general good. No man would be an enemy to his neighbour, for they would have no &s;ubject of contention; and, of con&s;equence, philanthropy would re&s;ume the empire which rea&s;on a&s;signs her.

<P>Man cannot live in the mid&s;t of plenty. All cannot &s;hare alike the bounties of nature.

a &s;ingle intellect would be left free to expatiate in the field of thought.</P>
<P>How little Mr. Godwin has turned the attention of his penetrating mind to the real &s;tate of man on earth, will &s;ufficiently appear from the manner in which he endeavours to remove the difficulty of an overcharged population. He &s;ays, <Q>The obvious an&s;wer to this objection, is, that to rea&s;on thus is to fore&s;ee difficulties at a great di&s;tance. Three fourths of the habitable globe is now uncultivated. The parts already cultivated are capable of immea&s;ureable improvement.

<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e all the cau&s;es of mi|&s;ery and vice in this i&s;land removed. War and contention cea&s;e. Unwhole|&s;ome trades and manufactories do not exi&s;t. Crowds no longer collect toge|ther in great and pe&s;tilent cities for purpo&s;es of court intrigue, of commerce, and vicious gratifications. Simple, healthy, and rational amu&s;ements take place of drinking, gaming and debauchery. There are no towns &s;ufficiently large to have

any prejudicial effects on the human con&s;titution. The greater part of the happy inhabitants of this terre&s;trial pa|radi&s;e live in hamlets and farm-hou&s;es &s;cattered over the face of the country.

And the nece&s;&s;ary labours of agriculture are &s;hared amica|bly among all. The number of per&s;ons, and the produce of the i&s;land, we &s;up|po&s;e to be the &s;ame as at pre&s;ent.

<P>Mr. Godwin con&s;iders marriage as a fraud and a monopoly. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the commerce of the &s;exes e&s;tabli&s;hed upon principles of the mo&s;t perfect freedom. Mr. Godwin does not think him&s;elf that this freedom would lead to a promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e; and in this I perfectly agree with him. The love of variety is a vi|cious, corrupt, and unnatural ta&s;te, and could not prevail in any great degree in a &s;imple and virtuous &s;tate of &s;ociety. Each man would probably &s;elect him&s;elf a partner, to whom he would adhere as long as that adherence continued to be the choice of both parties. It would be of little con&s;equence, according to Mr. Godwin, how many children a woman had, or to whom they belonged. Provi|&s;ions and a&s;si&s;tance would &s;pontaneou&s;ly
<PB N="184" REF="200">
flow from the quarter in which they abounded, to the quarter that was de|ficient <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B. S. Chap. 8. P. 504.</NOTE>. And every man would be ready to furni&s;h in&s;truction to the ri&s;ing genera|tion according to his capacity.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive a form of &s;ociety &s;o favourable upon the whole to popu|lation. The irremediablene&s;s of marri|age, as it is at pre&s;ent con&s;tituted, un|doubtedly deters many from entering into that &s;tate. An un&s;hackled inter|cour&s;e on the contrary, would be a mo&s;t powerful incitement to early attachments: and as we are &s;uppo&s;ing no anxiety about the future &s;upport of children to exi&s;t, I do not conceive that there would be one woman in a hundred, of twenty three, without a family.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="201">
With the&s;e extraordinary encourage|ments to population, and every cau&s;e of depopulation, as we have &s;uppo&s;ed, re|moved, the numbers would nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e fa&s;ter than in any &s;ociety that has ever yet been known. I have men|tioned, on the authority of a pamphlet publi&s;hed by a Dr. Styles, and referred to by Dr. Price, that the inhabitants of the back &s;ettlements of America doubled their numbers in fifteen years. England is certainly a more healthy country than the back &s;ettlements of America; and as we have &s;uppo&s;ed every hou&s;e in the i&s;land to be airy and whole&s;ome, and the encou|ragements to have a family greater even than with the back &s;ettlers, no probable rea&s;on can be a&s;signed, why the population &s;hould not double it&s;elf in le&s;s, if po&s;si|ble, than fifteen years. But to be quite &s;ure that we do not go beyond the truth, we will only &s;uppo&s;e the period of doub|ling

to be twenty-five years, a ratio of in|crea&s;e, which is well known to have taken place throughout all the Northern States of America.</P>
<P>There can be little doubt, that the equalization of property which we have &s;uppo&s;ed, added to the circum&s;tance of the labour of the whole community be|ing directed chiefly to agriculture, would tend greatly to augment the produce of the country. But to an&s;wer the demands of a population increa&s;ing &s;o rapidly, Mr. Godwin's calculation of half an hour a day for each man, would cer|tainly not be &s;ufficient. It is probable that the half of every man's time mu&s;t be employed for this purpo&s;e. Yet with &s;uch, or much greater exertions, a per|&s;on who is acquainted with the nature of the &s;oil in this country, and who reflects on the fertility of the lands already in
<PB N="187" REF="203">
cultivation, and the barrene&s;s of tho&s;e that are not cultivated, will be very much di&s;po&s;ed to doubt, whether the whole average produce could po&s;sibly be doubled in twenty-five years from the pre&s;ent period. The only chance of &s;ucce&s;s would be the ploughing up all the grazing countries, and putting an end almo&s;t entirely to the u&s;e of animal food. Yet a part of this &s;cheme might defeat it&s;elf. The &s;oil of England will not produce much without dre&s;sing; and cattle &s;eem to be nece&s;|&s;ary to make that &s;pecies of manure, which be&s;t &s;uits the land. In China, it is &s;aid, that the &s;oil in &s;ome of the provinces is &s;o fertile, as to produce two crops of rice in the year without dre&s;sing. None of the lands in England will an&s;wer to this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Difficult, however, as it might be, to double the average produce of the i&s;land in
<PB N="188" REF="204">
twenty-five years, let us &s;uppo&s;e it effected. At the expiration of the fir&s;t period there|fore, the food, though almo&s;t entirely ve|getable, would be &s;ufficient to &s;upport in health, the doubled population of four|teen millions.</P>
<P>During the next period of doubling, where will the food be found to &s;atisfy the importunate demands of the increa&s;ing numbers. Where is the fre&s;h land to turn up? where is the dre&s;sing nece&s;|&s;ary to improve that which is already in cultivation? There is no per&s;on with the &s;malle&s;t knowledge of land, but would &s;ay, that it was impo&s;sible that the average produce of the country could be increa&s;ed during the &s;econd twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what it at pre&s;ent yields. Yet we will &s;uppo&s;e this increa&s;e, however im|probable, to take place. The exuberant
<PB N="189" REF="205">
&s;trength of the argument allows of almo&s;t any conce&s;sion. Even with this conce&s;|&s;ion, however, there would be &s;even mil|lions at the expiration of the &s;econd term, unprovided for. A quantity of food equal to the frugal &s;upport of twenty-one mil|lions, would be to be divided among twenty-eight millions.</P>
<P>Alas! what becomes of the picture where men lived in the mid&s;t of plenty: where no man was obliged to provide with anxiety and pain for his re&s;tle&s;s wants: where the narrow principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s did not exi&s;t: where Mind was delivered from her perpetual anxiety about corporal &s;upport, and free to expa|tiate in the field of thought which is congenial to her. This beautiful fabric of imagination vani&s;hes at the &s;evere touch of truth. The &s;pirit of benevolence, cheri&s;hed and invigorated by plenty, is

<P>It may be curious to ob&s;erve, in the ca&s;e that we have been &s;uppo&s;ing, how &s;ome of the laws which at pre&s;ent govern civilized &s;ociety, would be &s;ucce&s;sively dictated by the mo&s;t imperious nece&s;sity.

As the&s;e violations

increa&s;ed in number and extent, the more active and comprehen&s;ive intellects of the &s;ociety would &s;oon perceive, that while population was fa&s;t increa&s;ing, the yearly produce of the country would &s;hortly begin to dimini&s;h. The urgency of the ca&s;e would &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;sity of &s;ome immediate mea&s;ures to be taken for the general &s;afety. Some kind of convention would then be called, and the dangerous &s;ituation of the country &s;tated in the &s;tronge&s;t terms.

<P>It might be urged perhaps by &s;ome objectors, that, as the fertility of the land increa&s;ed, and various accidents occurred, the &s;hare of &s;ome men might be much more than &s;ufficient for their &s;upport, and that when the reign of &s;elf-love was once e&s;tabli&s;hed, they would not di&s;tribute their &s;urplus produce without &s;ome com|pen&s;ation in return.

&s;hould throw away the re&s;t; but that even if he exchanged his &s;urplus food for the labour of others, and made them in &s;ome degree dependent on him, this would &s;till be better than that the&s;e others &s;hould ab&s;olutely &s;tarve.</P>
<P>It &s;eems highly probable, therefore, that an admini&s;tration of property, not very different from that which prevails in civilized States at pre&s;ent, would be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, as the be&s;t, though inadequate, remedy, for the evils which were pre&s;sing on the &s;ociety.</P>

while every man felt &s;ecure that all his children would be well provided for by general benevolence, the powers of the earth would be ab&s;olutely inadequate to produce food for the population which would inevitably en&s;ue: that even, if the whole attention and labour of the &s;ociety were directed to this &s;ole point, and if, by the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity of property, and every other encourage|ment that could be thought of, the greate&s;t po&s;sible increa&s;e of produce were yearly obtained; yet &s;till, that the in|crea&s;e of food would by no means keep pace with the much more rapid increa&s;e of population: that &s;ome check to popu|lation therefore was imperiou&s;ly called for: that the mo&s;t natural and obvious check &s;eemed to be, to make every man provide for his own children: that this would operate in &s;ome re&s;pect, as a mea|&s;ure and guide, in the increa&s;e of popu|lation;

And to pre|vent the frequent recurrence of &s;uch an inconvenience, as it would be highly unju&s;t to puni&s;h &s;o natural a fault by per&s;onal re&s;traint or infliction, the men might agree to puni&s;h it with di&s;grace. The offence is be&s;ides more obvious and con&s;picuous in the woman, and le&s;s lia|ble to any mi&s;take. The father of a child may not always be known, but the &s;ame uncertainty cannot ea&s;ily exi&s;t with regard to the mother. Where, the evi|dence

of the offence was mo&s;t complete, and the inconvenience to the &s;ociety at the &s;ame time the greate&s;t, there, it was agreed, that the large&s;t &s;hare of blame &s;hould fall. The obligation on every man to maintain his children, the &s;ociety would enforce, if there were occa&s;ion; and the greater degree of inconvenience or labour, to which a family would nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;ubject him, added to &s;ome portion of di&s;grace which every human being mu&s;t incur, who leads another into un|happine&s;s, might be con&s;idered as a &s;uf|ficient puni&s;hment for the man.</P>
<P>That a woman &s;hould at pre&s;ent be almo&s;t driven from &s;ociety, for an offence, which men commit nearly with impu|nity, &s;eems to be undoubtedly a breach of natural ju&s;tice. But the origin of the cu&s;tom, as the mo&s;t obvious and effec|tual method of preventing the frequent

recurrence of a &s;erious inconvenience to a community, appears to be natural, though not perhaps perfectly ju&s;ti&s;iable. This origin, however, is now lo&s;t in the new train of ideas which the cu&s;tom has &s;ince generated. What at fir&s;t might be dictated by &s;tate nece&s;sity, is now &s;up|ported by female delicacy; and operates with the greate&s;t force on that part of &s;ociety, where, if the original intention of the cu&s;tom were pre&s;erved, there is the lea&s;t real occa&s;ion for it.</P>

their &s;upport, what are they to do in a world where every thing is appropriated? We have &s;een the fatal effects that would re&s;ult to a &s;ociety, if every man had a valid claim to an equal &s;hare of the pro|duce of the earth. The members of a family which was grown too large for the original divi&s;ion of land appropriated to it, could not then demand a part of the &s;urplus produce of others, as a debt of ju&s;tice. It has appeared, that from the inevitable laws of our nature, &s;ome human beings mu&s;t &s;uffer from want. The&s;e are the unhappy per&s;ons who, in the great lottery of life, have drawn a blank. The number of the&s;e claimants would &s;oon exceed the ability of the &s;ur|plus produce to &s;upply. Moral merit is a very difficult di&s;tingui&s;hing criterion, except in extreme ca&s;es. The owners of &s;urplus produce would in general &s;eek &s;ome more obvious mark of di&s;tinction.
<PB N="205" REF="221">
And it &s;eems both natural and ju&s;t, that except upon particular occa&s;ions, their choice &s;hould fall upon tho&s;e, who were able, and profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves willing, to exert their &s;trength in procuring a further &s;urplus produce; and thus at once benefiting the community, and enabling the&s;e proprietors to afford a&s;si&s;tance to greater numbers. All who were in want of food would be urged by imperious nece&s;sity to offer their labour in exchange for this article &s;o ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to exi&s;tence. The fund appropriated to the maintenance of labour, would be, the aggregate quantity of food po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the owners of land beyond their own con&s;umption. When the demands upon this fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be divided in very &s;mall &s;hares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the rearing of families would be
<PB N="206" REF="222">
checked by &s;ickne&s;s and mi&s;ery. On the contrary, when this fund was increa&s;ing fa&s;t; when it was great in proportion to the number of claimants; it would be divided in much larger &s;hares. No man would exchange his labour without re|ceiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live in ca&s;e and comfort; and would con&s;equently be able to rear a numerous and vigorous off|&s;pring.</P>
<P>On the &s;tate of this fund, the happi|ne&s;s, or the degree of mi&s;ery, prevailing among the lower cla&s;&s;es of people in every known State, at pre&s;ent chiefly depends. And on this happine&s;s, or degree of mi&s;ery, depends the increa&s;e, &s;tationarine&s;s, or decrea&s;e of population.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, that a &s;ociety con|&s;tituted according to the mo&s;t beautiful
<PB N="207" REF="223">
form that imagination can conceive, with benevolence for its moving principle, in|&s;tead of &s;elf-love, and with every evil di&s;po&s;ition in all its members corrected by rea&s;on and not force, would, from the inevitable laws of nature, and not from any original depravity of man, in a very &s;hort period, degenerate into a &s;ociety, con&s;tructed upon a plan not e&s;&s;en|tially different from that which prevails in every known State at pre&s;ent; I mean, a &s;ociety divided into a cla&s;s of pro|prietors, and a cla&s;s of labourers, and with &s;elf-love for the main-&s;pring of the great machine.</P>
<P>In the &s;uppo&s;ition I have made, I have undoubtedly taken the increa&s;e of population &s;maller, and the increa&s;e of produce greater, than they really would be. No rea&s;on can be a&s;signed, why, under the circum&s;tances I have &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="208" REF="224">
population &s;hould not increa&s;e fa&s;ter than in any known in&s;tance. If then we were to take the period of doubling at fifteen years, in&s;tead of twenty-five years; and reflect upon the labour nece&s;&s;ary to double the produce in &s;o &s;hort a time, even if we allow it po&s;sible; we may venture to pronounce with certainty, that if Mr. Godwin's &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety was e&s;tabli&s;hed in its utmo&s;t perfection, in&s;tead of myriads of centuries, not thirty years could elap&s;e, before its utter de|&s;truction from the &s;imple principle of population.</P>
<P>I have taken no notice of emigration for obvious rea&s;ons. If &s;uch &s;ocieties were in&s;tituted in other parts of Europe, the&s;e countries would be under the &s;ame difficulties with regard to population, and could admit no fre&s;h members into their bo&s;oms.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. Godwin's conjecture concerning the future extinc|tion of the pa&s;&s;ion between the &s;exes.&mdash;Little apparent grounds for &s;uch a conjecture.&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ion of love not incon&s;i&s;tent either with rea&s;on or virtue.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Godwin's &s;y&s;|tem of &s;ociety once completely e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. But it is &s;uppo&s;ing an impo&s;|&s;ibility. The &s;ame cau&s;es in nature which would de&s;troy it &s;o rapidly, were it once e&s;tabli&s;hed, would prevent the po&s;sibility of its e&s;tabli&s;hment. And upon what grounds we can pre&s;ume a change in the&s;e natural cau&s;es, I am utterly at a lo&s;s to conjecture. No move towards the extinction of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes has taken place in the five or &s;ix thou&s;and years that the world has exi&s;ted. Men in the decline of life have, in all ages, declaimed again&s;t a pa&s;sion which
<PB N="211" REF="227">
they have cea&s;ed to feel, but with as little rea&s;on as &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e who from cold|ne&s;s of con&s;titutional temperament have never felt what love is, will &s;urely be allowed to be very incompetent judges, with regard to the power of this pa&s;sion, to contribute to the &s;um of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations in life. Tho&s;e who have &s;pent their youth in criminal exce&s;&s;es, and have prepared for them&s;elves, as the com|forts of their age, corporal debility, and mental remor&s;e, may well inveigh again&s;t &s;uch plea&s;ures as vain and &s;utile, and unproductive of la&s;ting &s;atisfaction. But the plea&s;ures of pure love will bear the contemplation of the mo&s;t improved rea|&s;on, and the mo&s;t exalted virtue. Per|haps there is &s;carcely a man who has once experienced the genuine delight of virtuous love, however great his intellec|tual plea&s;ures may have been, that does not look back to the period, as the &s;unny
<PB N="212" REF="228">
&s;pot in his whole life, where his imagina|tion loves to ba&s;k, which he recollects and contemplates with the fonde&s;t re|grets, and which he would mo&s;t wi&s;h to live over again. The &s;uperiority of in|tellectual, to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, con&s;i&s;ts rather, in their filling up more time, in their having a larger range, and in their being le&s;s liable to &s;atiety, than in their being more real and e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Intemperance in every enjoyment de|feats its own purpo&s;e. A walk in the fine&s;t day, through the mo&s;t beautiful country, if pur&s;ued too far, ends in pain and fatigue. The mo&s;t whole&s;ome and invigorating food, eaten with an unre|&s;trained appetite, produces weakne&s;s, in|&s;tead of &s;trength. Even intellectual plea|&s;ures, though certainly le&s;s liable than others to &s;atiety, pur&s;ued with too little intermi&s;sion, debilitate the body, and
<PB N="213" REF="229">
impair the vigour of the mind. To argue again&s;t the reality of the&s;e plea&s;ures from their abu&s;e, &s;eems to be hardly ju&s;t. Morality, according to Mr. Godwin, is a calculation of con&s;equences, or, as Archdeacon Paley very ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it, the will of God, as collected from general expediency. According to either of the&s;e definitions, a &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, not at|tended with the probability of unhappy con&s;equences, does not offend again&s;t the laws of morality: and if it be pur&s;ued with &s;uch a degree of temperance, as to leave the mo&s;t ample room for intellec|tual attainments, it mu&s;t undoubtedly add to the &s;um of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations in life. Virtuous love, exalted by friend|&s;hip, &s;eems to be that &s;ort of mixture of &s;en&s;ual and intellectual enjoyment par|ticularly &s;uited to the nature of man, and mo&s;t powerfully calculated to awaken
<PB N="214" REF="230">
the &s;ympathies of the &s;oul, and produce the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite gratifications.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin &s;ays, in order to &s;hew the evident inferiority of the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, <Q>Strip the commerce of the &s;exes of all its attendant circum&s;tances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 1. C. 5. P. 73.</NOTE>, and it would be generally de&s;pi&s;ed.</Q> He might as well &s;ay to a man who admired trees; &s;trip them of their &s;preading branches and lovely foliage, and what beauty can you &s;ee in a bare pole? But it was the tree with the branches and foliage, and not without them, that ex|cited admiration. One feature of an ob|ject, may be as di&s;tinct, and excite as different emotions, from the aggregate, as any two things the mo&s;t remote, as a beautiful woman, and a map of Mada|ga&s;car. It is <Q>the &s;ymmetry of per&s;on,
<PB N="215" REF="231">
the vivacity, the voluptuous &s;oftne&s;s of temper, the affectionate kindne&s;s of feel|ings, the imagination and the wit</Q> of a woman that excite the pa&s;sion of love, and not the mere di&s;tinction of her being a female. Urged by the pa&s;sion of love, men have been driven into acts highly prejudicial to the general intere&s;ts of &s;o|ciety; but probably they would have &s;ound no difficulty in re&s;i&s;ting the temp|tation, had it appeared in the form of a woman, with no other attractions what|ever but her &s;ex. To &s;trip &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures of all their adjuncts, in order to prove their inferiority, is to deprive a magnet of &s;ome of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential cau&s;es of attraction, and then to &s;ay that it is weak and inefficient.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit of every enjoyment, whether &s;en&s;ual or intellectual, Rea&s;on, that faculty which enables us to calculate
<PB N="216" REF="232">
con&s;equences, is the proper corrective and guide. It is probable therefore that improved rea&s;on will always tend to pre|vent the abu&s;e of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, though it by no means follows that it will extingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to expo&s;e the fal|lacy of that argument which infers an unlimited progre&s;s from a partial im|provement, the limits of which cannot be exactly a&s;certained. It has appeared, I think, that there are many in&s;tances in which a decided progre&s;s has been ob|&s;erved, where yet it would be a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e that progre&s;s inde|finite. But towards the extinction of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes, no ob&s;ervable progre&s;s whatever has hitherto been made. To &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an extinction, therefore, is merely to offer an unfounded conjec|ture,
<PB N="217" REF="233">
un&s;upported by any philo&s;ophical probabilities.</P>
<P>It is a truth, which hi&s;tory I am afraid makes too clear, that &s;ome men of the highe&s;t mental powers, have been ad|dicted not only to a moderate, but even to an immoderate indulgence in the plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;ual love. But allowing, as I &s;hould be inclined to do, notwith&s;tanding numerous in&s;tances to the contrary, that great intellectual exertions tend to dimini&s;h the empire of this pa&s;sion over man; it is evident that the ma&s;s of mankind mu&s;t be improved more highly than the brighte&s;t ornaments of the &s;pecies at pre&s;ent, before any difference can take place &s;ufficient &s;en&s;ibly to affect popula|tion. I would by no means &s;uppo&s;e that the ma&s;s of mankind has reached its term of improvement; but the principal ar|gument of this e&s;&s;ay tends to place in a

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Godwin's conjectnre re&s;pecting the future approach of man towards immor|tality on earth, &s;eems to be rather oddly placed in a chapter, which profe&s;&s;es to remove the objection to his &s;y&s;tem of equality from the principle of popula|tion. Unle&s;s he &s;uppo&s;es the pa&s;sion be|tween the &s;exes to decrea&s;e fa&s;ter, than the duration of life increa&s;es, the earth would be more encumbered than ever. But leaving this difficulty to Mr. God|win,
<PB N="220" REF="236">
let us examine a few of the ap|pearances from which the probable im|mortality of man is inferred.</P>
<P>To prove the power of the mind over the body, Mr. Godwin ob&s;erves, <Q>How often do we find a piece of good news di&s;sipating a di&s;temper? How common is the remark that tho&s;e accidents which are to the indolent a &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e, are forgotten and extirpated in the bu&s;y and active? I walk twenty miles in an indolent and half determined temper, and am extremely fatigued. I walk twenty miles full of ardour, and with a motive that engro&s;&s;es my &s;oul, and I come in as fre&s;h and as alert as when I began my journey. Emotions excited by &s;ome unexpected word, by a letter that is delivered to us, occa&s;ions the mo&s;t extraordinary revolutions in our frame, accelerates the circulation, cau&s;es
<PB N="221" REF="237">
the heart to palpitate, the tongue to refu&s;e its office, and has been known to occa&s;ion death by extreme angui&s;h or extreme joy. There is nothing in|deed of which the phy&s;ician is more aware than of the power of the mind in a&s;si&s;ting or retarding convale&s;cence.</Q></P>
<P>The in&s;tances here mentioned, are chiefly in&s;tances of the effects of men|tal &s;timulants on the bodily frame. No per&s;on has ever for a moment doubted the near, though my&s;terious connection, of mind and body. But it is arguing totally without knowledge of the na|ture of &s;timulants to &s;uppo&s;e, either that they can be applied continually with equal &s;trength, or if they could be &s;o applied, for a time, that they would not exhau&s;t and wear out the &s;ubject. In &s;ome of the ca&s;es here noticed, the &s;trength of the &s;timulus depends upon
<PB N="222" REF="238">
its novelty and unexpectedne&s;s. Such a &s;timulus cannot, from its nature, be re|peated often with the &s;ame effect, as it would by repetition lo&s;e that pro|perty which gives it its &s;trength.</P>
<P>In the other ca&s;es, the argument is from a &s;mall and partial effect, to a great and general effect, which will in numberle&s;s in&s;tances be found to be a very fallacious mode of rea&s;oning. The bu&s;y and active man may in &s;ome de|gree counteract, or what is perhaps nearer the truth, may di&s;regard tho&s;e &s;light di&s;|orders of frame, which fix the attention of a man who has nothing el&s;e to think of; but this does not tend to prove that activity of mind will enable a man to di&s;regard a high fever, the &s;mall|pox, or the plague.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239">
The man who walks twenty miles with a motive that engro&s;&s;es his &s;oul, does not attend to his &s;light fatigue of body when he comes in; but double his mo|tive, and &s;et him to walk another twenty miles, quadruple it, and let him &s;tart a third time, and &s;o on; and the length of his walk will ultimately depend upon mu&s;cle and not mind. Powel, for a mo|tive of ten guineas, would have walked further probably than Mr. Godwin, for a motive of half a million. A motive of uncommon power acting upon a frame of moderate &s;trength, would, perhaps, make the man kill him&s;elf by his exer|tions, but it would not make him walk an hundred miles in twenty-four hours. This &s;tatement of the ca&s;e, &s;hews the fallacy of &s;uppo&s;ing, that the per&s;on was really not at all tired in his fir&s;t walk of twenty miles, becau&s;e he did not appear to be &s;o, or, perhaps, &s;carcely
<PB N="224" REF="240">
felt any fatigue him&s;elf. The mind can|not fix its attention &s;trongly on more than one object at once. The twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;o engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts, that he did not attend to any &s;light &s;ore|ne&s;s of foot, or &s;tiffne&s;s of limb. But had he been really as fre&s;h and as alert, as when he fir&s;t &s;et off, he would be able to go the &s;econd twenty miles with as much ea&s;e as the fir&s;t, and &s;o on, the third, &amp;c. which leads to a palpable ab&s;urdity. When a hor&s;e of &s;pirit is nearly half tired, by the &s;timulus of the &s;pur, added to the proper manage|ment of the bit, he may be put &s;o much upon his mettle, that he would appear to a &s;tander-by, as fre&s;h and as high &s;pirited, as if he had not gone a mile. Nay, probably, the hor&s;e him&s;elf, while in the heat and pa&s;sion occa&s;ioned by this &s;timulus, would not feel any fatigue; but it would be &s;trangely con|trary
<PB N="225" REF="241">
to all rea&s;on and experience, to argue from &s;uch an appearance, that if the &s;timulus were continued, the hor&s;e would never be tired. The cry of a pack of hounds will make &s;ome hor&s;es, after a journey of forty miles on the road, appear as fre&s;h, and as lively, as when they fir&s;t &s;et out. Were they then to be hunted, no perceptible abatement would at fir&s;t be felt by their riders in their &s;trength and &s;pirits, but to|wards the end of a hard day, the pre|vious fatigue would have its full weight and effect, and make them tire &s;ooner. When I have taken a long walk with my gun, and met with no &s;ucce&s;s, I have frequently returned home feeling a con&s;iderable degree of uncomfortablene&s;s from fatigue. Another day, perhaps, going over nearly the &s;ame extent of ground with a good deal of &s;port, I have come home fre&s;h, and alert. The
<PB N="226" REF="242">
difference in the &s;en&s;ation of fatigue upon coming in, on the different days, may have been very &s;triking, but on the following mornings I have found no &s;uch difference. I have not perceived that I was le&s;s &s;tiff in my limbs, or le&s;s foot|&s;ore, on the morning after the day of &s;port, than on the other morning.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;timulants upon the mind &s;eem to act rather by taking off the attention from the bodily fatigue, than by really and truly counteracting it. If the energy of my mind had really counteracted the fatigue of my body, why &s;hould I feel tired the next morn|ing? If the &s;timulus of the hounds had as completely overcome the fatigue of the journey in reality, as it did in ap|pearance, why &s;hould the hor&s;e be tired &s;ooner than if he had not gone the forty miles? I happen to have a very bad fit
<PB N="227" REF="243">
of the tooth-ache at the time I am wri|ting this. In the eagerne&s;s of compo|&s;ition, I every now and then, for a mo|ment or two, forget it. Yet I cannot help thinking that the proce&s;s which cau&s;es the pain, is &s;till going forwards, and that the nerves, which carry the in|formation of it to the brain, are even during the&s;e moments demanding atten|tion, and room for their appropriate vi|brations. The multiplicity of vibrations of another kind, may perhaps prevent their admi&s;sion, or overcome them for a time when admitted, till a &s;hoot of ex|traordinary energy puts all other vibra|tions to the rout, de&s;troys the vividne&s;s of my argumentative conceptions, and rides triumphant in the brain. In this ca&s;e, as in the others, the mind &s;eems to have little or no power in counter|acting, or curing the di&s;order, but merely
<PB N="228" REF="244">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power, if &s;trongly excited, of fixing its attention on other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I do not, however, mean to &s;ay, that a &s;ound and vigorous mind has no ten|dency whatever to keep the body in a &s;imilar &s;tate. So clo&s;e and intimate is the union of mind and body, that it would be highly extraordinary, if they did not mutually a&s;si&s;t each others func|tions. But, perhaps, upon a compari&s;on, the body has more effect upon the mind, than the mind upon the body. The fir&s;t object of the mind is to act as purveyor to the wants of the body. When the&s;e wants are completely &s;atisfied, an active mind is indeed apt to wander further, to range over the fields of &s;cience, or &s;port in the regions of imagination, to fancy that it has <Q>&s;huffled off this mortal coil,</Q> and is &s;eeking its kindred element. But all the&s;e efforts are like
<PB N="229" REF="245">
the vain exertions of the hare in the fable. The &s;lowly moving tortoi&s;e, the body, never fails to overtake the mind, however widely and exten&s;ively it may have ranged, and the brighte&s;t and mo&s;t energetic intellects, unwillingly as they may attend to the fir&s;t or &s;econd &s;um|mons, mu&s;t ultimately yield the em|pire of the brain to the calls of hun|ger, or &s;ink with the exhau&s;ted body in &s;leep.</P>
<P>It &s;eems as if one might &s;ay with certainty, that if a medicine could be &s;ound to immortalize the body, there would be no fear of its being accom|panied by the immortality of the mind. But the immortality of the mind by no means &s;eems to infer the immortality of the body. On the contrary, the greate&s;t conceivable energy of mind would probably exhau&s;t and de&s;troy
<PB N="230" REF="246">
the &s;trength of the body. A temperate vigour of mind appears to be favoura|ble to health; but very great intellec|tual exertions tend rather, as has been often ob&s;erved, to wear out the &s;cab|bard. Mo&s;t of the in&s;tances which Mr. Godwin has brought to prove the power of the mind over the body, and the con&s;equent probability of the immorta|lity of man, are of this latter de&s;crip|tion, and could &s;uch &s;timulants be conti|nually applied, in&s;tead of tending to im|mortalize, they would tend very rapidly to de&s;troy the human frame.</P>
<P>The probable increa&s;e of the volun|tary power of man over his animal frame, comes next under Mr. Godwin's con&s;ideration, and he concludes by &s;ay|ing, that the voluntary power of &s;ome men, in this re&s;pect, is found to ex|tend to various articles in which other
<PB N="231" REF="247">
men are impotent. But this is rea&s;on|ing again&s;t an almo&s;t univer&s;al rule from a few exceptions: and the&s;e ex|ceptions &s;eem to be rather tricks, than powers, that may be exerted to any good purpo&s;e. I have never heard of any man who could regulate his pul&s;e in a fever; and doubt much, if any of the per&s;ons here alluded to, have made the &s;malle&s;t perceptible progre&s;s in the re|gular correction of the di&s;orders of their frames, and the con&s;equent prolonga|tion of their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Godwin &s;ays, <Q>Nothing can be more unphilo&s;ophical, than to conclude, that, becau&s;e a certain &s;pecies of power is beyond the train of our pre&s;ent ob|&s;ervation, that it is beyond the limits of the human mind.</Q> I own my ideas of philo&s;ophy are in this re&s;pect widely different from Mr. Godwin's.

di&s;tinction that I &s;ee, between a philo|&s;ophical conjecture, and the a&s;&s;ertions of the Prophet Mr. Brothers, is, that one is founded upon indications ari&s;ing from the train of our pre&s;ent ob&s;erva|tions, and the other has no foundation at all. I expect that great di&s;coveries are yet to take place in all the branches of human &s;cience, particularly in phy|&s;ics; but the moment we leave pa&s;t experience as the foundation of our conjectures concerning the future; and &s;till more, if our conjectures ab&s;olutely contradict pa&s;t experience, we are thrown upon a wide field of uncertainty, and any one &s;uppo&s;ition is then ju&s;t as good as another. If a per&s;on were to tell me that men would ultimately have eyes and hands behind them as well as before them, I &s;hould admit the u&s;efulne&s;s of the addition, but &s;hould give as a rea&s;on for my di&s;belief of it, that I

&s;aw no indications whatever in the pa&s;t, from which I could infer the &s;malle&s;t probability of &s;uch a change. If this be not allowed a valid objection, all conjectures are alike, and all equally philo&s;ophical. I own it appears to me, that in the train of our pre&s;ent ob&s;ervati|ons, there are no more genuine indications that man will become immortal upon earth, than that he will have four eyes and four hands, or that trees will grow horizontally in&s;tead of perpendicularly.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid, perhaps, that many di&s;coveries have already taken place in the world that were totally unfore&s;een and unexpected. This I grant to be true; but if a per&s;on had predicted the&s;e di&s;coveries, without being guided by any analogies or indications from pa&s;t facts, he would de&s;erve the name of &s;eer or prophet, but not of philo&s;o|pher.

The wonder that &s;ome of our modern di&s;coveries would excite in the &s;avage inhabitants of Europe in the times of The&s;eus and Achilles, proves but little. Per&s;ons almo&s;t entirely unacquaint|ed with the powers of a machine, can|not be expected to gue&s;s at its effects. I am far from &s;aying, that we are at pre&s;ent by any means fully acquainted with the powers of the human mind; but we certainly know more of this in|&s;trument than was known four thou&s;and years ago; and therefore, though not to be called competent judges, we are certainly much better able, than &s;avages, to &s;ay what is, or is not, within its gra&s;p. A watch would &s;trike a Savage with as much &s;urprize as a perpetual motion; yet one, is to us a mo&s;t fa|miliar piece of mechani&s;m, and the other, has con&s;tantly eluded the efforts of the mo&s;t acute intellects.

Though no attention of any kind, has ever pro|duced &s;uch an effect, as could be con|&s;trued into the &s;malle&s;t &s;emblance of an approach towards immortality; yet of the two, a certain attention to the body, &s;eems to have more effect in this re&s;pect, than an attention to the mind.

<P>As in the&s;e and &s;imilar in&s;tances, or to take a larger range, as in the great diver&s;ity of characters that have exi&s;ted during &s;ome thou&s;and years, no decided difference has been ob&s;erved in the du|ration of human life from the opera|tion of intellect, the mortality of man on earth &s;eems to be as completely e&s;tabli&s;hed, and exactly upon the &s;ame grounds, as any one, the mo&s;t con&s;tant, of the laws of nature. An immediate act of power in the Creator of the Uni|ver&s;e might, indeed, change one or all of the&s;e laws, either &s;uddenly or gra|dually; but without &s;ome indications of &s;uch a change, and &s;uch indications do not exi&s;t, it is ju&s;t as unphilo&s;ophical to &s;uppo&s;e that the life of man may be prolonged beyond any a&s;signable li|mits,

of the longing of the &s;oul after immortality. Both the&s;e gentlemen have rejected the light of revelation which ab&s;olutely promi&s;es eternal life in another &s;tate.

millions of years, will be &s;unk in annihilation; and that only a few be|ings, not greater in number than can exi&s;t at once upon the earth, will be ultimately crowned with immortality. Had &s;uch a tenet been advanced as a tenet of revelation, I am very &s;ure that all the enemies of religion, and probably Mr. Godwin, and Mr. Con|dorcet among the re&s;t, would have ex|hau&s;ted the whole force of their ridi|cule upon it, as the mo&s;t puerile, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd, the poore&s;t, the mo&s;t pitiful, the mo&s;t iniquitou&s;ly unju&s;t, and, con&s;e|quently, the mo&s;t unworthy of the Deity, that the &s;uper&s;titious folly of man could invent.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the chapter which I have been exa|amining, Mr. Godwin profe&s;&s;es to con|&s;ider the objection to his &s;y&s;tem of equa|lity from the principle of population. It has appeared I think clearly, that he is greatly erroneous in his &s;tatement of the di&s;tance of this difficulty; and that in&s;tead of myriads of centuries, it is really not thirty years, or even thirty days, di&s;tant from us. The &s;uppo&s;ition of the approach of man to immorta|lity on earth, is certainly not of a kind to &s;often the difficulty. The only ar|gument,
<PB N="251" REF="267">
therefore, in the chapter, which has any tendency to remove the objection, is the conjecture concerning the extinc|tion of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes; but as this is a mere conjecture, un&s;up|ported by the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of proof, the force of the objection may be fairly &s;aid to remain unimpaired; and it is un|doubtedly of &s;ufficient weight of it&s;elf completely to overturn Mr. Godwin's whole &s;y&s;tem of equality. I will, how|ever, make one or two ob&s;ervations on a few of the prominent parts of Mr. Godwin's rea&s;onings, which will contri|bute to place in a &s;till clearer point of view, the little hope that we can rea|&s;onably entertain of tho&s;e va&s;t improve|ments in the nature of man and of &s;o|ciety, which he holds up to our admiring gaze in his political ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="268">
Mr. Godwin con&s;iders man too much in the light of a being merely intellec|tual. This error, at lea&s;t &s;uch I conceive it to be, pervades his whole work, and mixes it&s;elf with all his rea&s;onings. The voluntary actions of men may originate in their opinions; but the&s;e opinions will be very differently modified in creatures compounded of a rational faculty and corporal propen&s;ities, from what they would be, in beings wholly intellectual. Mr. Godwin, in proving that &s;ound rea|&s;oning and truth, are capable of being adequately communicated, examines the propo&s;ition fir&s;t practically; and then adds, <Q>Such is the appearance which this pro|po&s;ition a&s;&s;umes, when examined in a loo&s;e and practical view. In &s;trict con|&s;ideration it will not admit of debate. Man is a rational being, &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B 1. C. 5. P. 89.</NOTE>.</Q> So far
<PB N="253" REF="269">
from calling this a &s;trict con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, I own I &s;hould call it the loo&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t erroneous way po&s;sible, of con&s;idering it. It is the calculating the velocity of a falling body in vacuo; and per&s;i&s;ting in it, that it would be the &s;ame through whatever re&s;i&s;ting me|diums it might fall. This was not New|ton's mode of philo&s;ophizing. Very few general propo&s;itions are ju&s;t in application to a particular &s;ubject. The moon is not kept in her orbit round the earth, nor the earth in her orbit round the &s;un, by a force that varies merely in the inver&s;e ratio of the &s;quares of the di&s;tances. To make the general theory ju&s;t in ap|plication to the revolutions of the&s;e bo|dies, it was nece&s;&s;ary to calculate ac|curately, the di&s;turbing force of the &s;un upon the moon, and of the moon upon the earth; and till the&s;e di&s;turbing forces were properly e&s;timated, actual ob&s;ervations on the motions of the&s;e bodies, would have
<PB N="254" REF="270">
proved that the theory was not accu|rately true.</P>
<P>I am willing to allow that every vo|luntary act is preceded by a deci&s;ion of the mind; but it is &s;trangely oppo&s;ite to what I &s;hould conceive to be the ju&s;t theory upon the &s;ubject, and a pal|pable contradiction to all experience, to &s;ay, that the corporal propen&s;ities of man do not act very powerfully, as di&s;turb|ing forces, in the&s;e deci&s;ions. The que&s;|tion, therefore, does not merely depend, upon whether a man may be made to under&s;tand a di&s;tinct propo&s;ition, or be convinced by an unan&s;werable argument. A truth may be brought home to his conviction as a rational being, though he may determine to act contrary to it, as a compound being. The cravings of hunger, the love of liquor, the de|&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;sing a beautiful woman, will
<PB N="255" REF="271">
urge men to actions, of the fatal con|&s;equences of which, to the general inte|re&s;ts of &s;ociety, they are perfectly well convinced, even at the very time they commit them. Remove their bodily cravings, and they would not he&s;itate a moment in determining again&s;t &s;uch actions. A&s;k them their opinion of the &s;ame conduct in another per&s;on, and they would immediately reprobate it. But in their own ca&s;e, and under all the cir|cum&s;tances of their &s;ituation with the&s;e bodily cravings, the deci&s;ion of the com|pound being is different from the con|viction of the rational being.</P>
<P>If this be the ju&s;t view of the &s;ubject; and both theory and experience unite to prove that it is; almo&s;t all Mr. Godwin's rea&s;onings on the &s;ubject of coercion in his 7th chapter, will appear to be founded on error. He &s;pends &s;ome time in placing
<PB N="256" REF="272">
in a ridiculous point of view, the at|tempt, to convince a man's under&s;tand|ing, and to clear up a doubtful propo|&s;ition in his mind, by blows. Undoubt|edly it is both ridiculous and barbarous; and &s;o is cock-fighting; but one has little more to do with the real object of human puni&s;hments, than the other. One frequent (indeed much too frequent) mode of puni&s;hment is death. Mr. God|win will hardly think this intended for conviction; at lea&s;t it does not appear how the individual, or the &s;ociety, could reap much future benefit from an un|der&s;tanding enlightened in this manner.</P>
<P>The principal objects which human pu|ni&s;hments have in view, are undoubtedly re&s;traint and example: re&s;traint, or re|moval of an individual member, who&s;e vicious habits are likely to be prejudi|cial to the &s;ociety. And example, which
<PB N="257" REF="273">
by expre&s;sing the &s;en&s;e of the commu|nity with regard to a particular crime, and by a&s;&s;ociating more nearly and vi|&s;ibly, crime and puni&s;hment, holds out a moral motive to di&s;&s;uade others from the commi&s;sion of it.</P>
<P>Re&s;traint, Mr. Godwin thinks, may be permitted as a temporary expedient, though he reprobates &s;olitary impri&s;on|ment, which has certainly been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, and, indeed, almo&s;t the only attempt, towards the moral amelioration of offenders. He talks of the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;|&s;ions that are fo&s;tered by &s;olitude, and of the virtues generated in &s;ociety. But &s;urely the&s;e virtues are not generated in the &s;ociety of a pri&s;on. Were the offender confined to the &s;ociety of able and virtuous men, he would probably be more improved than in &s;olitude. But is this practicable? Mr. Godwin's
<PB N="258" REF="274">
ingenuity is more frequently employed in finding out evils, than in &s;ugge&s;ting prac|tical remedies.</P>
<P>Puni&s;hment, for example, is totally reprobated. By endeavouring to make examples too impre&s;sive and terrible, na|tions have, indeed, been led into the mo&s;t barbarous cruelties; but the abu&s;e of any practice is not a good argument again&s;t its u&s;e. The indefatigable pains taken in this country to find out a murder, and the certainty of its puni&s;hment, has powerfully contributed to generate that &s;entiment which is frequent in the mouths of the common people, that a murder will &s;ooner or later come to light; and the habitual horror in which murder is in con&s;equence held, will make a man, in the agony of pa&s;sion, throw down his knife, for fear he &s;hould be tempted to u&s;e it in the gratification of his revenge.

In Italy, where murderers by flying to a &s;anctuary, are allowed more frequently to e&s;cape, the crime has never been held in the &s;ame dete&s;tation, and has con&s;equently been more frequent. No man, who is at all aware of the opera|tion of moral motives, can doubt for a moment, that if every murder in Italy had been invariably puni&s;hed, the u&s;e of the &s;tilletto in tran&s;ports of pa&s;sion, would have been comparatively but lit|tle known.</P>
<P>That human laws, either do, or can, proportion the puni&s;hment accurately to the offence, no per&s;on will have the folly to a&s;&s;ert.

<P>The frequency of crime among men, who, as the common &s;aying is, know better, &s;ufficiently proves, that &s;ome truths may be brought home to the conviction of the mind without always producing the proper effect upon the conduct. There are other truths of a

<PB N="262" REF="278">
in giving the preference, very greatly, to the plea&s;ures of intellect; and that my own experience completely confirmed the truth of their deci&s;ions; that I had found &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures vain, tran&s;ient, and con|tinually attended with tedium and di&s;|gu&s;t; but that intellectual plea&s;ures ap|peared to me ever fre&s;h and young, filled up all my hours &s;atisfactorily, gave a new ze&s;t to life, and diffu&s;ed a la&s;ting &s;erenity over my mind.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF the rea&s;onings of the preceding chap|ter are ju&s;t, the corollaries re&s;pecting poli|tical truth, which Mr. Godwin draws from the propo&s;ition, that the voluntary actions of men originate in their opinions, will not appear to be clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e corollaries are, <Q>Sound rea&s;oning and truth, when adequately communi|cated, mu&s;t always be victorious over error: Sound rea&s;oning and truth are capable of being &s;o communicated: Truth is omnipotent: The vices and moral
<PB N="265" REF="281">
weakne&s;s of man are not invincible: Man is perfectible, or in other words, &s;u&s;cep|tible of perpetual improvement.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t three propo&s;itions may be con&s;idered a complete &s;yllogi&s;m. If by adequately communicated, be meant &s;uch a conviction as to produce an adequate effect upon the conduct; the major may be allowed, and the minor denied. The con&s;equent, or the omnipotence of truth, of cour&s;e falls to the ground. If by ade|quately communicated be meant merely the conviction of the rational faculty; the major mu&s;t be denied, the minor will be only true in ca&s;es capable of de|mon&s;tration, and the con&s;equent equally falls. The fourth propo&s;ition, Mr. God|win calls the preceding propo&s;ition, with a &s;light variation in the &s;tatement. If &s;o, it mu&s;t accompany the preceding propo|&s;ition in its fall. But it may be worth
<PB N="266" REF="282">
while to inquire, with reference to the principal argument of this e&s;&s;ay, into the particular rea&s;ons which we have for &s;uppo&s;ing, that the vices and moral weak|ne&s;s of man can never be wholly over|come in this world.</P>
<P>Man, according to Mr. Godwin, is a creature, formed what he is, by the &s;uc|ce&s;sive impre&s;sions which he has received, from the fir&s;t moment that the germ from which he &s;prung was animated. Could he be placed in a &s;ituation, where he was &s;ub|ject to no evil impre&s;sions whatever, though it might be doubted whether in &s;uch a &s;ituation virtue could exi&s;t, vice would certainly be bani&s;hed. The great bent of Mr. Godwin's work on political ju&s;tice, if I under&s;tand it rightly, is to &s;hew, that the greater part of the vices and weakne&s;&s;es of men, procced from the inju&s;tice of their political and &s;ocial
<PB N="267" REF="283">
in&s;titutions: and that if the&s;e were re|moved, and the under&s;tandings of men more enlightened, there would be little or no temptation in the world to evil. As it has been clearly proved, however, (at lea&s;t as I think) that this is entirely a fal&s;e conception, and that, independent of any political or &s;ocial in&s;titutions what|ever, the greater part of mankind, from the fixed and unalterable laws of nature, mu&s;t ever be &s;ubject to the evil tempta|tions ari&s;ing from want, be&s;ides other pa&s;sions; it follows from Mr. Godwin's definition of man, that &s;uch impre&s;sions, and combinations of impre&s;sions, cannot be afloat in the world, without generat|ing a variety of bad men. According to Mr. Godwin's own conception of the formation of character, it is &s;urely as improbable that under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, all men will be virtuous, as that &s;ixes will come up a hundred times
<PB N="268" REF="284">
following upon the dice. The great va|riety of combinations upon the dice in a repeated &s;ucce&s;sion of throws, appears to me not inaptly to repre&s;ent the great variety of character that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in the world, &s;uppo&s;ing every individual to be formed what he is, by that combination of impre&s;sions which he has received &s;ince his fir&s;t exi&s;tence. And this compari&s;on will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that exceptions will ever be|come general rules; that extraordinary and unu&s;ual combinations will be fre|quent; or that the individual in&s;tances of great virtue which have appeared in all ages of the world, will ever prevail univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>I am aware that Mr. Godwin might &s;ay, that the compari&s;on is in one re&s;|pect inaccurate; that in the ca&s;e of the
<PB N="269" REF="285">
dice, the preceding cau&s;es, or rather the chances re&s;pecting the preceding cau&s;es, were always the &s;ame; and that, there|fore, I could have no good rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that a greater number of &s;ixes would come up in the next hundred times of throwing, than in the preceding &s;ame number of throws. But, that man had in &s;ome &s;ort a power of influencing tho&s;e cau&s;es that formed character; and that every good and virtuous man that was produced, by the influence which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have, rather increa&s;ed the probability that another &s;uch virtuous character would be ge|nerated; whereas the coming up of &s;ixes upon the dice once, would cer|tainly not increa&s;e the probability of their coming up a &s;econd time. I ad|mit this objection to the accuracy of the compari&s;on, but it is only partially
<PB N="270" REF="286">
valid. Repeated experience has a&s;&s;ured us, that the influence of the mo&s;t vir|tuous character will rarely prevail again&s;t very &s;trong temptations to evil. It will undoubtedly affect &s;ome, but it will fail with a much greater number. Had Mr. Godwin &s;ucceeded in his attempt to prove that the&s;e temptations to evil could by the exertions of man be re|moved, I would give up the compari|&s;on; or at lea&s;t allow, that a man might be &s;o far enlightened with re|gard to the mode of &s;haking his elbow, that he would be able to throw &s;ixes every time. But as long as a great number of tho&s;e impre&s;sions which form character, like the nice motions of the arm, remain ab&s;olutely independent of the will of man; though it would be the height of folly and pre&s;umption, to attempt to calculate the relative pro|portions
<PB N="271" REF="287">
of virtue and vice at the fu|ture periods of the world; it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that the vices and moral weakne&s;s of mankind, taken in the ma&s;s, are invincible.</P>
<P>The fifth propo&s;ition, is the general deduction from the four former, and will con&s;equently fall, as the founda|tions which &s;upport it have given way. In the &s;en&s;e in which Mr. Godwin under&s;tands the term perfectible, the perfectibility of man cannot be a&s;&s;erted, unle&s;s the preceding propo&s;itions could have been clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed. There is, however, one &s;en&s;e, which the term will bear, in which it is, perhaps, ju&s;t. It may be &s;aid with truth, that man is always &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement; or that there never has been, or will be, a period of his hi&s;tory, in which he can be &s;aid to have reached his po&s;si|ble
<PB N="272" REF="288">
achm&egrave; of perfection. Yet it does not by any means follow from this, that our efforts to improve man will always &s;ucceed; or even, that he will ever make, in the greate&s;t number of ages, any extraordinary &s;trides towards perfection. The only inference that can be drawn, is, that the preci&s;e li|mit of his improvement cannot po&s;sibly be known. And I cannot help again reminding the reader of a di&s;tinction, which, it appears to me, ought parti|cularly to be attended to in the pre|&s;ent que&s;tion; I mean, the e&s;&s;ential dif|ference there is, between an unlimited improvement, and an improvement the limit of which cannot be a&s;certained. The former is an improvement not ap|plicable to man under the pre&s;ent laws of his nature. The latter, undoubtedly, is applicable.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="289">
The real perfectibility of man may be illu&s;trated, as I have mentioned before, by the perfectibility of a plant. The object of the enterprizing flori&s;t, is, as I conceive, to unite &s;ize, &s;ymmetry, and beauty of colour. It would &s;urely be pre|&s;umptuous in the mo&s;t. &s;ucce&s;sful im|prover to affirm, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a carnation in which the&s;e qualities exi&s;ted in the greate&s;t po&s;sible &s;tate of perfec|tion. However beautiful his flower may be, other care, other &s;oil, or other &s;uns, might produce one &s;till more beautiful. Yet, although he may be aware of the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing that he has reached perfection; and though he may know by what means he attained that degree of beauty in the flower which he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, yet he cannot be &s;ure that by pur&s;uing &s;imilar means, rather increa&s;ed in &s;trength, he will obtain a more beautiful blo&s;&s;om. By endea|vouring
<PB N="274" REF="290">
to improve one quality, he may impair the beauty of another. The richer mould which he would employ to increa&s;e the &s;ize of his plant, would probably bur&s;t the calyx, and de&s;troy at once its &s;ymmetry. In a &s;imilar manner, the forcing manure u&s;ed to bring about the French revo|lution, and to give a greater freedom and energy to the human mind, has bur&s;t the calyx of humanity, the re&s;|training bond of all &s;ociety; and, however large the &s;eparate petals have grown; however &s;trongly, or even beautifully a few of them have been marked; the whole is at pre&s;ent a loo&s;e, deformed, disjointed ma&s;s, without union, &s;ymmetry, or harmony of colour|ing.</P>
<P>Were it of con&s;equence to improve pinks and carnations, though we could
<PB N="275" REF="291">
have no hope of rai&s;ing them as large as cabbages, we might undoubtedly ex|pect, by &s;ucce&s;sive efforts, to obtain more beautiful &s;pecimens than we at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s. No per&s;on can deny the im|portance of improving the happine&s;s of the human &s;pecies. Every, the lea&s;t advance in this re&s;pect, is highly valu|able. But an experiment with the hu|man race is not like an experiment upon inanimate objects. The bur&s;ting of a flower may be a trifle. Another will &s;oon &s;ucceed it. But the bur&s;ting of the bonds of &s;ociety is &s;uch a &s;e|paration of parts as cannot take place without giving the mo&s;t acute pain to thou&s;ands: and a long time may clap&s;e, and much mi&s;ery may be endured, be|fore the wound grows up again.</P>
<P>As the five propo&s;itions which I have been examining may be con&s;idered as
<PB N="276" REF="292">
the corner &s;tones of Mr. Godwin's fan|ciful &s;tructure; and, indeed, as expre&s;|&s;ing the aim and bent of his whole work; however excellent much of his detached rea&s;oning may be, he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as having failed in the great object of his undertaking. Be|&s;ides the difficulties ari&s;ing from the compound nature of man, which he has by no means &s;ufficiently &s;moothed; the principal argument again&s;t the perfec|tibility of man and &s;ociety remains whole and unimpaired from any thing that he has advanced. And as far as I can tru&s;t my own judgment, this ar|gument appears to be conclu&s;ive, not only again&s;t the perfectibility of man, in the enlarged &s;en&s;e in which Mr. Godwin under&s;tands the term, but again&s;t any very marked and &s;triking change for the better, in the form and &s;truc|ture of general &s;ociety; by which I
<PB N="277" REF="293">
mean, any great and decided ameliora|tion of the condition of the lower cla&s;&s;es of mankind, the mo&s;t numerous, and, con&s;equently, in a general view of the &s;ubject, the mo&s;t important part of the human race. Were I to live a thou|&s;and years, and the laws of nature to remain the &s;ame, I &s;hould little fear, or rather little hope, a contradiction from experience, in a&s;&s;erting, that no po&s;sible &s;acrifices or exertions of the rich, in a country which had been long inhabited, could for any time place the lower cla&s;&s;es of the community in a &s;ituation equal, with regard to cir|cum&s;tances, to the &s;ituation of the com|mon people, about thirty years ago, in the northern States of America.</P>
<P>The lower cla&s;&s;es of people in Eu|rope may, at &s;ome future period, be much better in&s;tructed than they are
<PB N="278" REF="294">
at pre&s;ent; they may be taught to employ the little &s;pare time they have in many better ways than at the ale|hou&s;e; they may live under better and more equal laws than they have ever hitherto done, perhaps, in any country; and I even conceive it po&s;sible, though not probable, that they may have more lei&s;ure; but it is not in the nature of things, that they can be awarded &s;uch a quantity of money or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as will allow them all to marry early, in the full confidence that they &s;hall be able to provide with ea&s;e for a nume|rous family.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. Godwin in the preface to his En|quirer, drops a few expre&s;sions which &s;eem to hint at &s;ome change in his opi|nions &s;ince he wrote the Political Ju&s;tice; and as this is a work now of &s;ome years &s;tanding, I &s;hould certainly think, that I had been arguing again&s;t opinions, which the author had him&s;elf &s;een rea&s;on to alter, but that in &s;ome of the e&s;&s;ays of the Enquirer, Mr. Godwin's peculiar mode of thinking, appears in as &s;triking a light as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="296">
It has been frequently ob&s;erved, that though we cannot hope to reach perfection in any thing, yet that it mu&s;t always be ad|vantageous to us, to place before our eyes the mo&s;t perfect models. This ob&s;erva|tion has a plau&s;ible appearance, but is very far from being generally true. I even doubt its truth in one of the mo&s;t obvious exemplifications that would occur. I doubt whether a very young painter would receive &s;o much benefit, from an attempt to copy a highly fini&s;hed and perfect picture, as from copying one where the outlines were more &s;trongly marked, and the manner of laying on the colours was more ea&s;ily di&s;coverable. But in ca&s;es, where the perfection of the model, is a perfection of a different and &s;uperior nature from that, towards which we &s;hould naturally advance, we &s;hall not only always fail in making any progre&s;s towards it, but we &s;hall
<PB N="281" REF="297">
in all probability impede the progre&s;s, which we might have expected to make, had we not fixed our eyes upon &s;o perfect a model. A highly intellectual being, exempt from the infirm calls of hunger or &s;leep, is undoubtedly a much more perfect exi&s;tence than man: but were man to at|tempt to copy &s;uch a model, he would not only fail in making any advances towards it; but by unwi&s;ely &s;training to imitate what was inimitable, he would probably de|&s;troy the little intellect which he was en|deavouring to improve.</P>
<P>The form and &s;tructure of &s;ociety which Mr. Godwin de&s;cribes, is as e&s;|&s;entially di&s;tinct from any forms of &s;o|ciety which have hitherto prevailed in the world, as a being that can live with|out food or &s;leep is from a man. By improving &s;ociety in its pre&s;ent form, we are making no more advances to|wards
<PB N="282" REF="298">
&s;uch a &s;tate of things as he pic|tures, than we &s;hould make approaches towards a line, with regard to which we were walking parallel. The que&s;tion, therefore is, whether, by looking to &s;uch a form of &s;ociety as our polar &s;tar, we are likely to advance or retard the improve|ment of the human &s;pecies? Mr. God|win appears to me to have decided this que&s;tion again&s;t him&s;elf in his e&s;&s;ay on avarice and profu&s;ion in the Enquirer.</P>
<P>Dr. Adam Smith has very ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved, that nations, as well as indivi|duals, grow rich by par&s;imony, and poor by profu&s;ion; and that, therefore, every frugal man was a friend, and every &s;pend|thrift an enemy to his country. The rea|&s;on he gives is, that what is &s;aved from revenue is always added to &s;tock, and is therefore taken from the maintenance of labour that is generally unproduc|tive,
<PB N="283" REF="299">
and employed in the maintenance of labour that realizes it&s;elf in valuable commodities. No ob&s;ervation can be more evidently ju&s;t. The &s;ubject of Mr. Godwin's e&s;&s;ay is a little &s;imilar in its fir&s;t appearance, but in e&s;&s;ence is as di&s;tinct as po&s;sible. He con&s;iders the mi&s;chief of profu&s;ion, as an acknowledged truth; and therefore makes his compa|ri&s;on between the avaricious man, and the man who &s;pends his income. But the avaricious man of Mr. Godwin, is totally a di&s;tinct character, at lea&s;t with regard to his effect upon the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate, from the frugal man of Dr. Adam Smith. The frugal man in order to make more money, &s;aves from his income, and adds to his capital; and this capital he either employs him|&s;elf in the maintenance of productive labour, or he lends it to &s;ome other per|&s;on, who will probably employ it in this
<PB N="284" REF="300">
way. He benefits the &s;tate, becau&s;e he adds to its general capital; and becau&s;e wealth employed as capital, not only &s;ets in motion more labour, than when &s;pent as income, but the labour is be|&s;ides of a more valuable kind. But the avaricious man of Mr. Godwin locks up his wealth in a che&s;t, and &s;ets in mo|tion no labour of any kind, either pro|ductive or unproductive. This is &s;o e&s;|&s;ential a difference, that Mr. Godwin's deci&s;ion in his e&s;&s;ay, appears at once as evidently fal&s;e, as Dr. Adam Smith's po&s;ition is evidently true. It could not, indeed, but occur to Mr. Godwin, that &s;ome pre&s;ent inconvenience might ari&s;e to the poor, from thus locking up the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of labour. The only way, therefore, he had of weakening this objection, was to com|pare the two characters chiefly with re|gard to their tendency to accelerate the
<PB N="285" REF="301">
approach of that happy &s;tate of culti|vated equality, on which he &s;ays we ought always to fix our eyes as our polar &s;tar.</P>
<P>I think it has been proved in the for|mer parts of this e&s;&s;ay, that &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety is ab&s;olutely impractica|ble. What con&s;equences then are we to expect from looking to &s;uch a point, as our guide and polar &s;tar, in the great &s;ea of political di&s;covery? Rea&s;on would teach us to expect no other, than winds perpetually adver&s;e, con&s;tant but fruit|le&s;s toil, frequent &s;hipwreck, and cer|tain mi&s;ery. We &s;hall not only fail in making the &s;malle&s;t real approach to|wards &s;uch a perfect form of &s;ociety; but by wa&s;ting our &s;trength of mind and body, in a direction in which it is impo&s;sible to proceed, and by the frequent di&s;tre&s;s which we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion by
<PB N="286" REF="302">
our repeated failures, we &s;hall evidently im|pede that degree of improvement in &s;o|ciety, which is really attainable.</P>
<P>It has appeared that a &s;ociety con&s;ti|tuted according to Mr. Godwin's &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t, from the inevitable laws of our nature, degenerate into a cla&s;s of pro|prietors, and a cla&s;s of labourers; and that the &s;ub&s;titution of benevolence, for &s;elf-love, as the moving principle of &s;o|ciety, in&s;tead of producing the happy effects that might be expected from &s;o fair a name, would cau&s;e the &s;ame pre&s;|&s;ure of want to be felt by the whole of &s;ociety, which is now felt only by a part. It is to the e&s;tabli&s;hed admini&s;tration of property, and to the apparently narrow principle of &s;elf-love, that we are in|debted for all the noble&s;t exertions of human genius, all the finer and more delicate emotions of the &s;oul, for every

Mr. Godwin would perhaps &s;ay, that the whole &s;y&s;tem of barter and exchange, is a vile and iniquitous traffic. If you would e&s;&s;entially relieve the poor man, you &s;hould take a part of his labour upon your&s;elf, or give him your money, without exacting &s;o &s;evere a return for it. In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t method pro|po&s;ed, it may be ob&s;erved, that even if the rich could be per&s;uaded to a&s;si&s;t the poor in this way, the value of the a&s;si&s;tance would be comparatively trifling. The rich, though they think them&s;elves of great importance, bear but a &s;mall proportion in point of numbers to the poor, and would, therefore, relieve them but of a &s;mall part of their burdens by taking a &s;hare.

<P>It has appeared that from the princi|ple of population, more will always be in want than can be adequately &s;upplied. The &s;urplus of the rich man might be &s;ufficient for three, but four will be de|&s;irous to obtain it. He cannot make this &s;election of three out of the four, with|out conferring a great favour on tho&s;e that are the objects of his choice.

The rich man would feel his power, and the poor man his dependence; and the evil effects of the&s;e two impre&s;sions on the human heart are well known. Though I perfectly agree with Mr. Godwin there|fore in the evil of hard labour; yet I &s;till think it a le&s;s evil, and le&s;s calculated to deba&s;e the human mind, than depend|ence; and every hi&s;tory of man that we have ever read, places in a &s;trong point of view, the danger to which that mind is expo&s;ed, which is intru&s;ted with con&s;tant power.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and particularly when labour is in reque&s;t, the man who does a days work for me, con&s;ers full as great an obligation upon me, as I do upon him. I po&s;&s;e&s;s what he wants; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es what I want. We make an amicable exchange. The

<P>Three or four hundred years ago, there was undoubtedly much le&s;s la|bour in England, in proportion to the population, than at pre&s;ent; but there was much more dependence: and we probably &s;hould not now enjoy our pre&s;ent degree of civil liberty, if the poor, by the introduction of manufac|tures, had not been enabled to give &s;omething in exchange for the provi|&s;ions of the great Lords, in&s;tead of be|ing dependent upon their bounty. Even the greate&s;t enemies of trade and ma|nufactures, and I do not reckon my|&s;elf a very determined friend to them, mu&s;t allow, that when they were in|troduced
<PB N="294" REF="310">
into England, liberty came in their train.</P>
<P>Nothing that has been &s;aid, tends in the mo&s;t remote degree to undervalue the principle of benevolence. It is one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t godlike quali|ties of the human heart, generated per|haps, &s;lowly and gradually from &s;elf-love; and afterwards intended to act as a general law, who&s;e kind office it &s;hould be, to &s;often the partial deformities, to correct the a&s;|perities, and to &s;mooth the wrinkles of its parent: and this &s;eems to be the analogy of all nature. Perhaps there is no one general law of nature that will not ap|pear, to us at lea&s;t, to produce partial evil; and we frequently ob&s;erve at the &s;ame time, &s;ome bountiful provi&s;ion, which acting as another general law, corrects the inequalities of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="311">
The proper office of benevolence is to &s;often the partial evils ari&s;ing from &s;elf|love, but it can never be &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. If no man were to allow him|&s;elf to act, till he had completely deter|mined, that the action he was about to perform, was more conducive than any other to the general good, the mo&s;t en|lightened minds would he&s;itate in per|plexity and amazement; and the un|enlightened, would be continually com|mitting the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>As Mr. Godwin, therefore, has not laid down any practical principle, according to which the nece&s;&s;ary labours of agricul|ture might be amicably &s;hared among the whole cla&s;s of labourers; by general in|vectives again&s;t employing the poor, he appears to pur&s;ue an unattainable good through much pre&s;ent evil. For if every man who employs the poor, ought to be
<PB N="296" REF="312">
con&s;idered as their enemy, and as adding to the weight of their oppre&s;sions; and if the mi&s;er is, for this rea&s;on, to be pre|ferred to the man who &s;pends his income, it follows, that any number of men who now &s;pend their incomes, might, to the advantage of &s;ociety, be converted into mi&s;ers. Suppo&s;e then, that a hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons who now employ ten men each, were to lock up their wealth from general u&s;e, it is evident, that a million of working men of different kinds would be completely thrown out of all employment. The exten&s;ive mi|&s;ery that &s;uch an event would produce in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, Mr. Godwin him&s;elf could hardly refu&s;e to acknowledge; and I que&s;tion whether he might not find &s;ome difficulty in proving, that a conduct of this kind tended more than the conduct of tho&s;e who &s;pend their incomes to <Q>place
<PB N="297" REF="313">
human beings in the condition in which they ought to be placed.</Q></P>
<P>But Mr. Godwin &s;ays, that the mi&s;er really locks up nothing; that the point has not been rightly under&s;tood; and that the true development and defini|tion of the nature of wealth have not been applied to illu&s;trate it. Having defined therefore wealth, very ju&s;tly, to be the commodities rai&s;ed and fo&s;tered by human labour, he ob&s;erves, that the mi&s;er locks up neither corn, nor oxen, nor clothes, nor hou&s;es. Undoubtedly he does not really lock up the&s;e arti|cles, but he locks up the power of producing them, which is virtually the &s;ame. The&s;e things are certainly u&s;ed and con&s;umed by his contemporaries, as truly, and to as great an extent, as if he were a beggar; but not to as great an ex|tent, as if he had employed his wealth, in turning up more land, in breeding more
<PB N="298" REF="314">
oxen, in employing more taylors, and in building more hou&s;es. But &s;uppo&s;ing, for a moment, that the conduct of the mi&s;er did not tend to check any really u&s;eful produce, how are all tho&s;e, who are thrown out of employment, to obtain patents which they may &s;hew in order to be awarded a proper &s;hare of the food and raiment produced by the &s;o|ciety? This is the unconquerable diffi|culty.</P>
<P>I am perfectly willing to concede to Mr. Godwin that there is much more labour in the world than is really ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and that, if the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety could agree among them&s;elves never to work more than &s;ix or &s;even hours in the day, the commodities e&s;|&s;ential to human happine&s;s might &s;till be produced in as great abundance as at pre&s;ent. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;sible to
<PB N="299" REF="315">
that &s;uch an agreement could be adhered to. From the principle of population, &s;ome would nece&s;&s;arily be more in want than others. Tho&s;e that had large families, would naturally be de&s;irous of exchanging two hours more of their labour for an ampler quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. How are they to be prevented from making this exchange? It would be a violation of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred property that a man po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, to attempt, by po&s;itive in&s;titutions, to interfere with his command over his own labour.</P>
<P>Till Mr. Godwin, therefore, can point out &s;ome practical plan according to which the nece&s;&s;ary labour in a &s;ociety might be equitably divided; his invec|tives again&s;t labour, if they were at|tended to, would certainly produce much pre&s;ent evil, without approximating us
<PB N="300" REF="316">
to that &s;tate of cultivated equality to which he looks forward as his polar &s;tar; and which, he &s;eems to think, &s;hould at pre&s;ent be our guide in determining the nature and tendency of human actions. A mariner guided by &s;uch a polar &s;tar is in danger of &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no po&s;sible way in which wealth could, in general, be em|ployed &s;o beneficially to a &s;tate, and particularly to the lower orders of it, as by improving and rendering productive that land, which to a farmer would not an&s;wer the expence of cultivation. Had Mr. Godwin exerted his energetic elo|quence in painting the &s;uperior worth and u&s;efulne&s;s of the character who employed the poor in this way, to him who employed them in narrow luxu|ries, every enlightened man mu&s;t have applauded his efforts. The increa&s;ing
<PB N="301" REF="317">
demand for agricultural labour mu&s;t always tend to better the condition of the poor; and if the acce&s;sion of work be of this kind, &s;o far is it from being true, that the poor would be obliged to work ten hours, for the &s;ame price, that they before worked eight, that the very rever&s;e would be the fact; and a labourer might then &s;upport his wife and family as well by the labour of &s;ix hours, as he could before by the la|bour of eight.</P>
<P>The labour created by luxuries, though u&s;eful in di&s;tributing the produce of the country, without vitiating the proprietor by power, or deba&s;ing the labourer by dependence, has not, indeed, the &s;ame beneficial effects on the &s;tate of the poor. A great acce&s;sion of work from manufactures, though it may rai&s;e the price of labour even more than an in|crea&s;ing demand for agricultural labour;
<PB N="302" REF="318">
yet, as in this ca&s;e, the quantity of food in the country may not be pro|portionably increa&s;ing, the advantage to the poor will be but temporary, as the price of provi&s;ions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e in proportion to the price of labour. Relative to this &s;ubject, I cannot avoid venturing a few remarks on a part of Dr. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations; &s;peaking at the &s;ame time with that diffidence, which I ought certainly to feel, in differing from a per&s;on &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated in the political world.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Probable error of Dr. Adam Smith in repre&s;enting every increa&s;e of the revenue or &s;tock of a &s;ociety as an increa&s;e in the funds for the maintenance of labour.&mdash;In&s;tances where an increa&s;e of wealth can have no tendency to better the condition of the labouring poor.&mdash;England has increa&s;ed in riches without a proportional increa&s;e in the funds for the maintenance of labour.&mdash;The &s;tate of the poor in China would not be improved by an in|crea&s;e of wealth from manufactures.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE profe&s;&s;ed object of Dr. Adam Smith's inquiry, is, the nature and cau&s;es of the wealth of nations. There is ano|ther inquiry, however, perhaps &s;till more intere&s;ting, which he occa&s;ionally mixes with it; I mean an inquiry into the cau&s;es which affect the happine&s;s of nations, or the happine&s;s and comfort of the lower orders of &s;ociety, which is the mo&s;t numerous cla&s;s in every na|tion. I am &s;ufficiently aware of the
<PB N="304" REF="320">
near connection of the&s;e two &s;ubjects, and that the cau&s;es which tend to in|crea&s;e the wealth of a State, tend al&s;o, generally &s;peaking, to increa&s;e the hap|pine&s;s of the lower cla&s;&s;es of the peo|ple. But perhaps Dr. Adam Smith has con&s;idered the&s;e two inquiries as &s;till more nearly connected than they really are; at lea&s;t, he has not &s;topped to take notice of tho&s;e in&s;tances, where the wealth of a &s;ociety may increa&s;e (according to his definition of wealth) without having any tendency to increa&s;e the comforts of the labouring part of it. I do not mean to enter into a philo&s;ophical di&s;cu&s;sion of what con|&s;titutes the proper happine&s;s of man; but &s;hall merely con&s;ider two univer|&s;ally acknowledged ingredients, health, and the command of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="321">
Little or no doubt can exi&s;t, that the comforts of the labouring poor de|pend upon the increa&s;e of the funds de&s;tined for the maintenance of labour; and will be very exactly in proportion to the rapidity of this increa&s;e. The demand for labour which &s;uch increa&s;e would occa&s;ion, by creating a compe|tition in the market, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e the value of labour; and, till the additional number of hands required were reared, the increa&s;ed funds would be di&s;tributed to the &s;ame number of per&s;ons as before the increa&s;e, and therefore every labourer would live com|paratively at his ea&s;e. But perhaps Dr. Adam Smith errs in repre&s;enting every increa&s;e of the revenue or &s;tock of a &s;ociety as an increa&s;e of the&s;e funds. Such &s;urplus &s;tock or revenue will, in|deed, always be con&s;idered by the in|dividual po&s;&s;e&s;sing it, as an additional
<PB N="306" REF="322">
fund from which he may maintain more labour: but it will not be a real and effectual fund for the maintenance of an additional number of labourers, unle&s;s the whole, or at lea&s;t a great part of this increa&s;e of the &s;tock or revenue of the &s;ociety, be convertible into a pro|portional quantity of provi&s;ions; and it will not be &s;o convertible, where the increa&s;e has ari&s;en merely from the produce of labour, and not from the produce of land. A di&s;tinction will in this ca&s;e occur, between the number of hands which the &s;tock of the &s;ociety could employ, and the number which its territory can maintain.</P>
<P>To explain my&s;elf by an in&s;tance. Dr. Adam Smith defines the wealth of a nation to con&s;i&s;t in the annual pro|duce of its land and labour. This de|finition evidently includes manufactured
<PB N="307" REF="323">
produce, as well as the produce of the land. Now &s;uppo&s;ing a nation, for a cour&s;e of years, was to add what it &s;aved from its yearly revenue, to its manufac|turing capital &s;olely, and not to its ca|pital employed upon land, it is evident, that it might grow richer according to the above definition, without a power of &s;upporting a greater number of la|bourers, and therefore, without an in|crea&s;e in the real funds for the mainte|nance of labour. There would, not|with&s;tanding, be a demand for labour, from the power which each manufac|turer would po&s;&s;e&s;s, or at lea&s;t think he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of extending his old &s;tock in trade, or of &s;etting up fre&s;h works. This demand would of cour&s;e rai&s;e the price of labour; but if the yearly &s;tock of provi&s;ions in the country was not increa&s;ing, this ri&s;e would &s;oon turn out to be merely nominal, as the price of pro|vi&s;ions
<PB N="308" REF="324">
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e with it. The demand for manufacturing labourers might, indeed, entice many from agri|culture, and thus tend to dimini&s;h the annual produce of the land; but we will &s;uppo&s;e any effect of this kind to be compen&s;ated by improvements in the in&s;truments of agriculture, and the quan|tity of provi&s;ions therefore to remain the &s;ame. Improvements in manufac|turing machinery would of cour&s;e take place; and this circum&s;tance, added to the greater number of hands employed in manufactures, would cau&s;e the annual produce of the labour of the country to be upon the whole greatly increa&s;ed. The wealth therefore of the country would be increa&s;ing annually, accord|ing to the definition, and might not, perhaps, be increa&s;ing very &s;lowly.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="325">
The que&s;tion is, whether wealth, in|crea&s;ing in this way, has any tendency to better the condition of the labour|ing poor. It is a &s;elf-evident propo&s;i|tion, that any general ri&s;e in the price of labour, the &s;tock of provi&s;ions re|maining the &s;ame, can only be a no|minal ri&s;e, as it mu&s;t very &s;hortly be followed by a proportional ri&s;e in pro|vi&s;ions. The increa&s;e in the price of labour therefore, which we have &s;up|po&s;ed, would have little or no effect in giving the labouring poor a greater command over the nece&s;&s;aries and con|veniences of life. In this re&s;pect they would be nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate as before. In one other re&s;pect they would be in a wor&s;e &s;tate. A greater pro|portion of them would be employed in manufactures, and fewer, con&s;equently, in agriculture. And this exchange of profe&s;sions will be allowed, I think, by
<PB N="310" REF="326">
all, to be very unfavourable in re&s;pect of health, one e&s;&s;ential ingredient of happine&s;s, be&s;ides the greater uncer|tainty of manufacturing labour, ari&s;ing from the capricious ta&s;te of man, the accidents of war, and other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that &s;uch an in&s;tance as I have &s;uppo&s;ed could not occur, becau&s;e the ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions would immediately turn &s;ome additional capital into the chan|nel of agriculture. But this is an event which may take place very &s;lowly, as it &s;hould be remarked, that a ri&s;e in the price of labour, had preceded the ri&s;e of provi&s;ions, and would, therefore, impede the good effects upon agricul|ture, which the increa&s;ed value of the produce of the land might otherwi&s;e have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="327">
It might al&s;o be &s;aid, that the ad|ditional capital of the nation would enable it to import provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for the maintenance of tho&s;e whom its &s;tock could employ. A &s;mall country with a large navy, and great inland accommodations for carriage, &s;uch as Holland, may, indeed, import and di&s;|tribute an effectual quantity of provi|&s;ions; but the price of provi&s;ions mu&s;t be very high, to make &s;uch an impor|tation and di&s;tribution an&s;wer in large countries, le&s;s advantageou&s;ly circum|&s;tanced in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance, accurately &s;uch as I have &s;uppo&s;ed, may not, perhaps, ever have occurred; but I have little doubt that in&s;tances nearly approximating to it may be found without any very laborious &s;earch. Indeed I am &s;trongly inclined to think, that England her&s;elf, &s;ince the
<PB N="312" REF="328">
revolution, affords a very &s;triking eluci|dation of the argument in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The commerce of this country, in|ternal, as well as external, has certainly been rapidly advancing during the la&s;t century. The exchangeable value, in the market of Europe, of the annual produce of its land and labour, has, without doubt, increa&s;ed very con&s;ider|ably. But, upon examination, it will be found, that the increa&s;e has been chiefly in the produce of labour, and not in the produce of land; and there|fore, though the wealth of the nation has been advancing with a quick pace, the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour have been increa&s;ing very &s;lowly; and the re&s;ult is &s;uch as might be expected. The increa&s;ing wealth of the nation has had little or no ten|dency to better the condition of the
<PB N="313" REF="329">
labouring poor. They have not, I be|lieve, a greater command of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life; and a much greater proportion of them, than at the period of the revolution, is em|ployed in manufactures, and crowded together in clo&s;e and unwhole&s;ome rooms.</P>
<P>Could we believe the &s;tatement of Dr. Price, that the population of Eng|land has decrea&s;ed &s;ince the revolution, it would even appear, that the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour had been declining during the progre&s;s of wealth in other re&s;pects. For I con|ceive that it may be laid down as a general rule, that if the effectual funds for the maintenance of labour are in|crea&s;ing, that is, if the territory can maintain, as well as the &s;tock employ, a greater number of labourers, this ad|ditional number will quickly &s;pring up,
<PB N="314" REF="330">
even in &s;pite of &s;uch wars as Dr. Price enumerates. And, con&s;equently, if the population of any country has been &s;ta|tionary, or declining, we may &s;afely infer, that, however it may have ad|vanced in manufacturing wealth, its ef|fectual funds for the maintenance of la|bour cannot have increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is difficult, however, to conceive that the population of England has been declining &s;ince the revolution; though every te&s;timony concurs to prove that its increa&s;e, if it has increa&s;ed, has been very &s;low. In the controver&s;y which the que&s;tion has occa&s;ioned, Dr. Price undoubtedly appears to be much more completely ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s more accurate information than his opponents. Judging &s;imply from this controver&s;y, I think one &s;hould &s;ay, that Dr. Price's point is nearer be|ing
<PB N="315" REF="331">
proved than Mr. Howlett's. Truth, probably, lies between the two &s;tatements, but this &s;uppo&s;ition makes the increa&s;e of population, &s;ince the revolution, to have been very &s;low, in compari&s;on with the increa&s;e of wealth.</P>
<P>That the produce of the land has been decrea&s;ing, or even that it has been ab|&s;olutely &s;tationary during the la&s;t cen|tury, few will be di&s;po&s;ed to believe. The inclo&s;ure of commons and wa&s;te lands, certainly tends to increa&s;e the food of the country; but it has been a&s;&s;erted with confidence, that the inclo&s;ure of com|mon fields, has frequently had a con|trary effect; and that large tracts of land, which formerly produced great quantities of corn, by being converted into pa&s;ture, both employ fewer hands, and feed fewer mouths, than before their inclo&s;ure. It is, indeed, an acknowledged
<PB N="316" REF="332">
truth, that pa&s;ture land produces a &s;maller quantity of human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, than corn land of the &s;ame natural fertility; and could it be clearly a&s;certained, that from the increa&s;ed demand for butchers meat of the be&s;t quality, and its increa&s;ed price in con&s;equence, a greater quantity of good land has annually been employed in grazing, the diminution of human &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, which this circum&s;tance would occa&s;ion, might have counterbalanced the advantages derived from the inclo&s;ure of wa&s;te lands, and the general improve|ments in hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>It &s;carcely need be remarked, that the high price of butchers meat at pre&s;ent, and its low price formerly, were not cau&s;ed by the &s;carcity in the one ca&s;e, or the plenty in the other, but by the different expence &s;u&s;tained at the diffe|rent periods, in preparing cattle for the
<PB N="317" REF="333">
market. It is, however, po&s;sible, that there might have been more cattle a hundred years ago in the country, than at pre&s;ent; but no doubt can be enter|tained, that there is much more meat of a &s;uperior quality brought to market at pre&s;ent, than ever there was. When the price of butchers meat was very low, cattle were reared chiefly upon wa&s;te lands; and except for &s;ome of the prin|cipal markets, were probably killed with but little other fatting. The veal that is &s;old &s;o cheap in &s;ome di&s;tant coun|ties at pre&s;ent, bears little other re&s;em|blance than the name, to that which is bought in London. Formerly, the price of butchers meat would not pay for rear|ing, and &s;carcely for feeding cattle on land that would an&s;wer in tillage; but the pre&s;ent price will not only pay for fatting cattle on the very be&s;t land, but will even allow of the rearing many, on
<PB N="318" REF="334">
land that would bear good crops of corn. The &s;ame number of cattle, or even the &s;ame weight of cattle at the different pe|riods when killed, will have con&s;umed (if I may be allowed the expre&s;sion) very different quantities of human &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. A fatted bea&s;t may in &s;ome re&s;pects be con&s;idered, in the language of the French oeconomi&s;ts, as an unpro|ductive labourer: he has added nothing to the value of the raw produce that he has con&s;umed. The pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of grazing, undoubtedly tends more than the former &s;y&s;tem to dimini&s;h the quantity of human &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the country, in proportion to the general fertility of the land.</P>
<P>I would not by any means be under|&s;tood to &s;ay, that the former &s;y&s;tem ei|ther could, or ought, to have continued. The increa&s;ing price of butchers meat,
<PB N="319" REF="335">
is a natural and inevitable con&s;equence of the general progre&s;s of cultivation; but I cannot help thinking, that the pre|&s;ent great demand for butchers meat of the be&s;t quality, and the quantity of good land that is in con&s;equence annually em|ployed to produce it, together with the great number of hor&s;es at pre&s;ent kept for plea&s;ure, are the chief cau&s;es, that have prevented the quantity of human food in the country, from keeping pace with the generally increa&s;ed fertility of the &s;oil; and a change of cu&s;tom in the&s;e re&s;pects, would, I have little doubt, have a very &s;en&s;ible effect on the quan|tity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the country, and con&s;equently on its population.</P>
<P>The employment of much of the mo&s;t fertile land in grazing, the im|provements in agricultural in&s;truments, the increa&s;e of large farms, and parti|cularly,
<PB N="320" REF="336">
the diminution of the number of cottages throughout the kingdom, all concur to prove, that there are not probably, &s;o many per&s;ons employed in agricultural labour now, as at the period of the revolution. Whatever increa&s;e of population, therefore, has taken place, mu&s;t be employed almo&s;t wholly in manufactures; and it is well known, that the failure of &s;ome of the&s;e manu|factures, merely from the caprice of fa&s;hion, &s;uch as, the adoption of mu&s;lins in&s;tead of &s;ilks, or of &s;hoe-&s;trings, and covered buttons, in&s;tead of buckles and metal buttons, combined with the re|&s;traints in the market of labour ari&s;ing from corporation, and pari&s;h laws, have frequently driven thou&s;ands on charity for &s;upport. The great increa&s;e of the poors rates, is, indeed, of it&s;elf, a &s;trong evidence, that the poor have not a greater command of the nece&s;&s;aries and conve|niences
<PB N="321" REF="337">
of life; and if to the con&s;idera|tion, that their condition in this re|&s;pect is rather wor&s;e than better, be added the circum&s;tance, that a much greater proportion of them is employed in large manufactories, unfavourable both to health and virtue, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that the increa&s;e of wealth of late years, has had no tendency to in|crea&s;e the happine&s;s of the labouring poor.</P>
<P>That every increa&s;e of the &s;tock or revenue of a nation, cannot be con|&s;idered as an increa&s;e of the real funds for the maintenance of labour, and, therefore, cannot have the &s;ame good effect upon the condition of the poor, will appear in a &s;trong light, if the ar|gument be applied to China.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="338">
Dr. Adam Smith ob&s;erves, that China has probably long been as rich, as the na|ture of her laws and in&s;titutions will admit; but that with other laws and in&s;titutions, and if foreign commerce were had in honour, &s;he might &s;till be much richer. The que&s;tion is, would &s;uch an increa&s;e of wealth, be an increa&s;e of the real funds for the maintenance of la|bour, and con&s;equently, tend to place the lower cla&s;&s;es of people in China in a &s;tate of greater plenty?</P>
<P>It is evident, that if trade and foreign commerce were held in great honour in China; from the plenty of labourers, and the cheapne&s;s of labour, &s;he might work up manufactures for foreign &s;ale to an immen&s;e amount. It is equally evi|dent, that from the great bulk of provi|&s;ions, and the amazing extent of her in|land territory, &s;he could not in return
<PB N="323" REF="339">
import &s;uch a quantity, as would be any &s;en&s;ible addition to the annual &s;tock of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the country. Her im|men&s;e amount of manufactures, therefore, &s;he would exchange, chiefly, for luxuries collected from all parts of the world. At pre&s;ent, it appears, that no labour what|ever is &s;pared in the production of food. The country is rather over peopled in proportion to what its &s;tock can em|ploy, and labour is, therefore, &s;o abun|dant, that no pains are taken to abridge it. The con&s;equence of this, is, probably, the greate&s;t production of food that the &s;oil can po&s;sibly afford: for it will be generally ob&s;erved, that proce&s;&s;es for abridging labour, though they may ena|ble a farmer to bring a certain quan|tity of grain cheaper to market, tend rather to dimini&s;h, than increa&s;e the whole produce; and in agriculture, there|fore, may, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be con&s;idered
<PB N="324" REF="340">
rather as private, than public advantages. An immen&s;e capital could not be em|ployed in China in preparing manufac|tures for foreign trade, without taking off &s;o many labourers from agriculture, as to alter this &s;tate of things, and in &s;ome degree to dimini&s;h the produce of the country. The demand for manufac|turing labourers would naturally rai&s;e the price of labour; but as the quantity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence would not be increa&s;ed, the price of provi&s;ions would keep pace with it; or even more than keep pace with it, if the quantity of provi&s;ions were really decrea&s;ing. The country would be evidently advancing in wealth: the exchangeable value of the annual pro|duce of its land and labour, would be an|nually augmented; yet the real funds for the maintenance of labour, would be &s;tationary, or even declining; and, con&s;equently, the increa&s;ing wealth of
<PB N="325" REF="341">
the nation would rather tend to depre&s;s, than to rai&s;e, the condition of the poor. With regard to the command over the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, they would be in the &s;ame or rather wor&s;e &s;tate than before; and a great part of them would have exchanged the healthy labours of agriculture, for the unhealthy occupations of manufacturing indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The argument, perhaps, appears clearer when applied to China, becau&s;e it is ge|nerally allowed, that the wealth of China has been long &s;tationary. With regard to any other country it might be always a matter of di&s;pute, at which of the two periods, compared, wealth was increa&s;ing the fa&s;te&s;t; as it is upon the rapidity of the increa&s;e of wealth at any particular period, that Dr. Adam Smith &s;ays the condition of the poor depends. It is evi|dent, however, that two nations might
<PB N="326" REF="342">
increa&s;e, exactly with the &s;ame rapi|dity, in the exchangeable value of the annual produce of their land and la|bour; yet if one had applied it&s;elf chiefly to agriculture, and the other chiefly to commerce, the funds for the maintenance of labour, and con&s;equently the effect of the increa&s;e of wealth in each nation, would be extremely different. In that which had applied it&s;elf chiefly to agri|culture, the poor would live in great plenty, and population would rapidly in|crea&s;e. In that which had applied it&s;elf chiefly to commerce, the poor would be comparatively but little benefited, and con&s;equently population would increa&s;e &s;lowly.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A QUESTION &s;eems naturally to ari&s;e here, whether the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and la|bour, be the proper definition of the wealth of a country; or, whether the gro&s;s produce of the land, according to the French oeconomi&s;ts, may not be a more accurate definition. Certain it is, that every increa&s;e of wealth, according to the definition of the Oeconomi&s;ts, will
<PB N="328" REF="344">
be an increa&s;e of the funds for the main|tenance of labour, and con&s;equently will always tend to ameliorate the condition of the labouring poor; though an in|crea&s;e of wealth, according to Dr. Adam Smith's definition, will by no means in|variably have the &s;ame tendency. And yet it may not follow from this con|&s;ideration, that Dr. Adam Smith's de|finition is not ju&s;t. It &s;eems in many re&s;pects improper, to exclude the cloath|ing and lodging of a whole people from any part of their revenue. Much of it may, indeed, be of very trivial and unimportant value, in compari&s;on with the food of the country; yet &s;till it may be fairly con&s;idered as a part of its re|venue: and, therefore, the only point in which I &s;hould differ from Dr. Adam Smith, is, where he &s;eems to con&s;ider every increa&s;e of the revenue or &s;tock of a &s;ociety, as an increa&s;e of the funds
<PB N="329" REF="345">
for the maintenance of labour, and con|&s;equently, as tending always to ameliorate the condition of the poor.</P>
<P>The fine &s;ilks and cottons, the laces, and other ornamental luxuries, of a rich country, may contribute very con&s;ider|ably to augment the exchangeable value of its annual produce; yet they con|tribute but in a very &s;mall degree, to augment the ma&s;s of happine&s;s in the &s;ociety: and it appears to me, that it is with &s;ome view to the real utility of the produce, that we ought to e&s;ti|mate the productivene&s;s, or unproduc|tivene&s;s of different &s;orts of labour. The French Oeconomi&s;ts con&s;ider all labour employed in manufactures as unproduc|tive. Comparing it with the labour em|ployed upon land, I &s;hould be perfectly di&s;po&s;ed to agree with them; but not ex|actly for the rea&s;ons which they give.
<PB N="330" REF="346">
They &s;ay, that labour employed upon land is productive, becau&s;e the produce, over and above completely paying the labourer and the farmer, affords a clear rent to the landlord; and that the labour employed upon a piece of lace is unpro|ductive, becau&s;e it merely replaces the provi&s;ions that the workman had con|&s;umed, and the &s;tock of his employer, without affording any clear rent what|ever. But &s;uppo&s;ing the value of the wrought lace to be &s;uch, as that be|&s;ides paying in the mo&s;t complete man|ner the workman and his employer, it could afford a clear rent to a third per&s;on; it appears to me, that in com|pari&s;on with the labour employed upon land, it would be &s;till as unproductive as ever. Though according to the rea|&s;oning u&s;ed by the French Oeconomi&s;ts, the man employed in the manufacture of lace would, in this ca&s;e, &s;eem to be a pro|ductive
<PB N="331" REF="347">
labourer; yet according to their definition of the wealth of a &s;tate, he ought not to be con&s;idered in that light. He will have added nothing to the gro&s;s produce of the land: he has con&s;umed a portion of this gro&s;s produce, and has left a bit of lace in return; and though he may &s;ell this bit of lace for three times the quantity of provi&s;ions that he con|&s;umed whil&s;t he was making it, and thus be a very productive labourer with regard to him&s;elf; yet he cannot be con&s;idered as having added by his labour to any e&s;&s;ential part of the riches of the &s;tate. The clear rent, therefore, that a certain produce can afford, after paying the expences of procuring it, does not ap|pear to be the &s;ole criterion, by which to judge of the productivene&s;s or un|productivene&s;s to a &s;tate, of any parti|cular &s;pecies of labour.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="348">
Suppo&s;e, that two hundred thou&s;and men, who are now employed in producing manufactures, that only tend to gratify the vanity of a few rich people, were to be employed upon &s;ome barren and un|cultivated lands, and to produce only half the quantity of food that they them&s;elves con&s;umed; they would be &s;till, more productive labourers with regard to the &s;tate, than they were before; though their labour, &s;o far from affording a rent to a third per&s;on, would but half replace the provi&s;ions u&s;ed in obtain|ing the produce. In their former employ|ment, they con&s;umed a certain portion of the food of the country, and left in return, &s;ome &s;ilks and laces. In their latter employment, they con&s;umed the &s;ame quantity of food, and left in re|turn, provi&s;ion for a hundred thou&s;and men. There can be little doubt, which of the two legacies would be the mo&s;t
<PB N="333" REF="349">
really beneficial to the country; and it will, I think, be allowed, that the wealth which &s;upported the two hundred thou|&s;and men, while they were producing &s;ilks and laces, would have been more u&s;efully employed in &s;upporting them, while they were producing the additional quantity of food.</P>
<P>A capital employed upon land, may be unproductive to the individual that employs it, and yet be highly produc|tive to the &s;ociety. A capital employed in trade on the contrary, may be highly productive to the individual, and yet be almo&s;t totally unproductive to the &s;o|ciety: and this is the rea&s;on why I &s;hould call manufacturing labour unpro|ductive, in compari&s;on of that which is employed in agriculture, and not for the rea&s;on given by the French Oeconomi&s;ts. It is, indeed, almo&s;t impo&s;sible, to &s;ee
<PB N="334" REF="350">
the great fortunes that are made in trade, and the liberality with which &s;o many merchants live, and yet agree in the &s;tatement or the Oeconomi&s;ts, that ma|nufacturers can only grow rich by de|priving them&s;elves of the funds de&s;|tined for their &s;upport. In many branches of trade the profits are &s;o great, as would allow of a clear rent to a third per&s;on: but as there is no third per&s;on in the ca&s;e, and as all the profits centre in the ma&s;ter manufacturer, or merchant, he &s;eems to have a fair chance of grow|ing rich, without much privation; and we con&s;equently &s;ee large fortunes ac|quired in trade by per&s;ons who have not been remarked for their par&s;imony.</P>
<P>Daily experience proves, that the labour employed in trade and manufactures, is &s;ufficiently productive to individuals; but it certainly is not productive in the &s;ame
<PB N="335" REF="351">
degree to the &s;tate. Every acce&s;sion to the food of a country, tends to the im|mediate benefit of the whole &s;ociety; but the fortunes made in trade, tend, but in a remote and uncertain manner, to the &s;ame end, and in &s;ome re&s;pects have even a contrary tendency. The home trade of con&s;umption, is by far the mo&s;t important trade of every nation. China is the riche&s;t country in the world, with|out any other. Putting then, for a mo|ment, foreign trade out of the que&s;tion, the man, who by an ingenious manufac|ture, obtains a double portion out of the old &s;tock of provi&s;ions, will certainly not be &s;o u&s;eful to the &s;tate, as the man who, by his labour, adds a &s;ingle &s;hare to the former &s;tock. The con&s;umable commo|dities of &s;ilks, laces, trinkets, and ex|pen&s;ive furniture, are undoubtedly a part of the revenue of the &s;ociety; but they are the revenue only of the rich, and
<PB N="336" REF="352">
not of the &s;ociety in general. An in|crea&s;e in this part of the revenue of a &s;tate, cannot, therefore, be con&s;idered of the &s;ame importance, as an increa&s;e of food, which forms the principal re|venue of the great ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Foreign commerce adds to the wealth of a &s;tate, according to Dr. Adam Smith's definition, though not according to the definition of the oeconomi&s;ts. Its princi|pal u&s;e, and the rea&s;on, probably, that it has in general been held in &s;uch high e&s;timation, is, that it adds greatly to the external power of a nation, or to its power of commanding the labour of other countries; but it will be found, upon a near examination, to contribute but little to the increa&s;e of the internal funds for the maintenance of labour, and con&s;e|quently but little to the happine&s;s of the greate&s;t part of &s;ociety. In the natural
<PB N="337" REF="353">
progre&s;s of a &s;tate towards riches, manu|factures, and foreign commerce; would follow, in their order, the high cultiva|tion of the &s;oil. In Europe, this natural order of things has been inverted; and the &s;oil has been cultivated from the redun|dancy of manufacturing capital, in&s;tead of manufactures ri&s;ing from the redun|dancy of capital employed upon land. The &s;uperior encouragement that has been given to the indu&s;try of the towns, and the con&s;equent higher price that is paid for the labour of artificers, than for the labour of tho&s;e employed in hu&s;bandry, are probably the rea&s;ons why &s;o much &s;oil in Europe remains uncultivated. Had a different policy been pur&s;ued through|out Europe, it might undoubtedly have been much more populous than at pre|&s;ent, and yet not be more incumbered by its population.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="354">
I cannot quit this curious &s;ubject of the difficulty ari&s;ing from population, a &s;ubject, that appears to me, to de&s;erve a minute inve&s;tigation, and able di&s;cu&s;sion, much beyond my power to give it, with|out taking notice of an extraordinary pa&s;&s;age in Dr. Price's two volumes of Ob|&s;ervations. Having given &s;ome tables on the probabilities of life, in towns and in the country, he &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2. page 243.</NOTE> <Q>From this com|pari&s;on, it appears, with how much truth great cities have been called the graves of mankind. It mu&s;t al&s;o convince all who will con&s;ider it, that according to the ob|&s;ervation, at the end of the fourth e&s;&s;ay, in the former volume, it is by no means &s;trictly proper to con&s;ider our di&s;ea&s;es as the original intention of nature. They are, without doubt, in general our own creation. <HI>Were there a country where the</HI><PB N="339" REF="355"><HI>inhabitants led lives entirely natural and virtuous, few of them would die without mea&s;uring out the whole period of pre&s;ent exi&s;tence allotted to them; pain and di&s;tem|per would be unknown among them, and death would come upon them like a &s;leep, in con&s;equence of no other cau&s;e than gra|dual and unavoidable decay.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I own, that I felt my&s;elf obliged to draw a very oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion from the facts advanced in Dr. Price's two volumes. I had for &s;ome time been aware, that population and food, increa&s;ed in dif|ferent ratios; and a vague opinion had been floating in my mind, that they could only be kept equal by &s;ome &s;pecies of mi&s;ery or vice; but the peru&s;al of Dr. Price's two volumes of Ob&s;ervations, after that opinion had been conceived, rai&s;ed it at once to conviction. With &s;o many facts in his view, to prove the
<PB N="340" REF="356">
extraordinary rapidity with which po|pulation increa&s;es, when unchecked; and with &s;uch a body of evidence before him, to elucidate, even the manner, by which the general laws of nature repre&s;s a re|dundant population; it is perfectly in|conceivable to me, how he could write the pa&s;&s;age that I have quoted. He was a &s;trenuous advocate for early marriages, as the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t vicious manners. He had no fanciful concep|tions about the extinction of the pa&s;sion between the &s;exes, like Mr. Godwin, nor did he ever think of eluding the dif|ficulty in the ways hinted at by Mr. Condorcet. He frequently talks of giving the prolifick powers of nature room to exert them&s;elves. Yet with the&s;e ideas, that his under&s;tanding could e&s;cape from the obvious and nece&s;&s;ary inference, that an unchecked population would increa&s;e, beyond compari&s;on, fa&s;ter than the earth,
<PB N="341" REF="357">
by the be&s;t directed exertions of man, could produce food for its &s;upport, ap|pears to me as a&s;toni&s;hing, as if he had re&s;i&s;ted the conclu&s;ion of one of the plaine&s;t propo&s;itions of Euclid.</P>
<P>Dr. Price, &s;peaking of the different &s;tages of the civilized &s;tate, &s;ays, <Q>The fir&s;t, or &s;imple &s;tages of civilization, are tho&s;e which favour mo&s;t the increa&s;e and the happine&s;s of mankind.</Q> He then in&s;tances the American colonies, as be|ing at that time in the fir&s;t, and happie&s;t of the &s;tates, that he had de&s;cribed; and as affording a very &s;triking proof of the effects of the different &s;tages of civiliza|tion on population. But he does not &s;eem to be aware, that the happine&s;s of the Americans, depended much le&s;s upon their peculiar degree of civilization, than upon the peculiarity of their &s;ituation, as new colonies, upon their having a
<PB N="342" REF="358">
great plenty of fertile uncultivated land. In parts of Norway, Denmark, or Swe|den, or in this country, two or three hun|dred years ago, he might have found per|haps nearly the &s;ame degree of civilization; but by no means the &s;ame happine&s;s, or the &s;ame increa&s;e of population. He quotes him&s;elf a &s;tatute of Henry the Eighth, complaining of the decay of til|lage, and the enhanced price of provi|&s;ions, <Q>whereby a marvellous number of people were rendered incapable of main|taining them&s;elves and families.</Q> The &s;u|perior degree of civil liberty which prevail|ed in America, contributed, without doubt, its &s;hare, to promote the indu&s;try, hap|pine&s;s, and population of the&s;e &s;tates: but even civil liberty, all powerful as it is, will not create fre&s;h land. The Ame|ricans may be &s;aid, perhaps, to enjoy a greater degree of civil liberty, now they are an independent people, than while
<PB N="343" REF="359">
they were in &s;ubjection to England; but we may be perfectly &s;ure, that popula|tion will not long continue to increa&s;e with the &s;ame rapidity as it did then.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who contemplated the hap|py &s;tate of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people in America twenty years ago, would naturally wi&s;h to retain them for ever in that &s;tate; and might think, per|haps, that by preventing the introduc|tion of manufactures and luxury, he might effect his purpo&s;e: but he might as rea&s;onably expect to prevent a wife or mi&s;tre&s;s from growing old by never expo&s;ing her to the &s;un or air. The &s;ituation of new colonies, well governed, is a bloom of youth that no efforts can arre&s;t. There are, indeed, many modes of treatment in the political, as well as animal body, that contribute to accele|rate or retard the approaches of age:
<PB N="344" REF="360">
but there can be no chance of &s;ucce&s;s, in any mode that could be devi&s;ed, for keeping either of them in perpetual youth. By encouraging the indu&s;try of the towns more than the indu&s;try of the country, Europe may be &s;aid, per|haps, to have brought on a premature old age. A different policy in this re&s;pect, would infu&s;e fre&s;h life and vigour into every &s;tate. While from the law of primogeni|ture, and other European cu&s;toms, land bears a monopoly price, a capital can never be employed in it with much advantage to the individual; and, there|fore, it is not probable that the &s;oil &s;hould be properly cultivated. And, though in every civilized &s;tate, a cla&s;s of proprietors and a cla&s;s of labourers mu&s;t exi&s;t; yet one permanent advantage would always re&s;ult from a nearer equali|zation of property.

It is, undoubtedly, a mo&s;t di&s;hearten|ing reflection, that the great ob&s;tacle in the way to any extraordinary im|provement in &s;ociety, is of a nature that we can never hope to overcome. The perpetual tendency in the race of man to increa&s;e beyond the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is one of the general laws of animated nature, which we can have no rea&s;on to expect will change. Yet, di&s;|couraging as the contemplation of this difficulty mu&s;t be, to tho&s;e who&s;e ex|ertions are laudably directed to the im|provement of the human &s;pecies, it is evident, that no po&s;sible good can ari&s;e from any endeavours to &s;lur it over, or keep it in the back ground. On the contrary, the mo&s;t baleful mi&s;chiefs may be expected from the unmanly conduct of not daring to face truth, becau&s;e it is unplea&s;ing. Independently of what relates to this great ob&s;tacle,
<PB N="347" REF="363">
&s;ufficient yet remains to be done for mankind, to animate us to the mo&s;t un|remitted exertion.

<P>THE view of human life, which re|&s;ults from the contemplation of the con&s;tant pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s on man from the difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by &s;hewing the little expectation that he can rea&s;onably entertain of perfectibility on earth, &s;eems &s;trongly to point his hopes to the future. And the tempta|tions to which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be expo&s;ed, from the operation of tho&s;e laws of nature which we have been ex|amining,

would &s;eem to repre&s;ent the world, in the light in which it has been frequently con&s;idered, as a &s;tate of trial, and &s;chool of virtue, preparatory to a &s;uperior &s;tate of happine&s;s. But I hope I &s;hall be pardoned, if I attempt to give a view in &s;ome degree different of the &s;ituation of man on earth, which appears to me, to be more con|&s;i&s;tent with the various phenomena of nature which we ob&s;erve around us, and more con&s;onant to our ideas of the power, goodne&s;s, and foreknowledge of the Deity.</P>
<P>It cannot be con&s;idered as an unim|proving exerci&s;e of the human mind to endeavour to</P>
<Q>Vindicate the ways of God to man.</Q>
<P>If we proceed with a proper di&s;tru&s;t of our own under&s;tandings, and a ju&s;t
<PB N="350" REF="366">
&s;en&s;e of our in&s;ufficiency to comprehend the rea&s;on of all that we &s;ee; if we hail every ray of light with gratitude; and when no light appears, think that the darkne&s;s is from within, and not from without; and bow with humble defe|rence to the &s;upreme wi&s;dom of him, who&s;e <Q>thoughts are above our thoughts,</Q> <Q>as the heavens are high above the earth.</Q></P>
<P>In all our feeble attempts, however, to <Q>find out the Almighty to perfec|tion,</Q> it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould rea&s;on from nature up to nature's God, and not pre&s;ume to rea|&s;on from God to nature. The moment we allow our&s;elves to a&s;k why &s;ome things are not otherwi&s;e, in&s;tead of en|deavouring to account for them, as they are, we &s;hall never know where to &s;top; we &s;hall be led into the
<PB N="351" REF="367">
gro&s;se&s;t, and mo&s;t childi&s;h ab&s;urdities; all progre&s;s in the knowledge of the ways of Providence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be at an end; and the &s;tudy will even cea&s;e to be an improving exerci&s;e of the hu|man mind. Infinite power is &s;o va&s;t and incomprehen&s;ible an idea, that the mind of man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be be|wildered in the contemplation of it. With the crude and puerile conceptions which we &s;ometimes form of this at|tribute of the Deity, we might imagine that God could call into being myriads, and myriads of exi&s;tences; all free from pain and imperfection; all eminent in goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom; all capable of the highe&s;t enjoyments; and unnumbered as the points throughout infinite &s;pace. But when from the&s;e vain and extra|vagant dreams of fancy, we turn our eyes to the book of nature, where alone we can read God as he is, we &s;ee a con|&s;tant
<PB N="352" REF="368">
&s;ucce&s;sion of &s;entient beings, ri&s;ing apparently from &s;o many &s;pecks of mat|ter, going through a long and &s;ome|times painful proce&s;s in this world; but many of them attaining, ere the ter|mination of it, &s;uch high qualities and powers, as &s;eem to indicate their fitne&s;s for &s;ome &s;uperior &s;tate. Ought we not then to correct our crude and puerile ideas of Infinite Power from the contem|plation of what we actually &s;ee exi&s;ting? Can we judge of the Creator but from his creation? And, unle&s;s we wi&s;h to exalt the power of God at the expence of his goodne&s;s, ought we not to con|clude, that even to the Great Creator, Almighty as he is, a certain proce&s;s may be nece&s;&s;ary, a certain time, (or at lea&s;t what appears to us as time) may be requi&s;ite, in order to form beings with tho&s;e exalted qualities of mind which will fit them for his high purpo&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="369">
A &s;tate of trial &s;eems to imply a previou&s;ly formed exi&s;tence, that does not agree with the appearance of man in infancy, and indicates &s;omething like &s;u&s;picion and want of foreknowledge, incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e ideas which we wi&s;h to cheri&s;h of the Supreme Being. I &s;hould be inclined, therefore, as I have hinted before in a note, to con|&s;ider the world, and this life, as the mighty proce&s;s of God, not for the trial, but for the creation and formation of mind; a proces&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, to awaken inert, chaotic matter, into &s;pirit; to &s;ub|limate the du&s;t of the earth into &s;oul; to elicit an aethereal &s;park from the clod of clay. And in this view of the &s;ubject, the various impre&s;sions and ex|citements which man receives through life, may be con&s;idered as the forming hand of his Creator, acting by general laws, and awakening his &s;luggi&s;h ex|i&s;tence,
<PB N="354" REF="370">
by the animating touches of the Divinity, into a capacity of &s;uperior enjoyment. The original &s;in of man, is the torpor and corruption of the chaotic matter, in which he may be &s;aid to be born.</P>
<P>It could an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e to enter into the que&s;tion, whether mind be a di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tance from matter, or only a finer form of it. The que&s;tion is, perhaps, after all, a que&s;tion merely of words. Mind is as e&s;&s;entially mind, whether formed from matter, or any other &s;ub&s;tance. We know, from ex|perience, that &s;oul and body are mo&s;t intimately united; and every appearance &s;eems to indicate, that they grow from infancy together. It would be a &s;up|po&s;ition attended with very little proba|bility, to believe that a complete and full formed &s;pirit exi&s;ted in every infant;
<PB N="355" REF="371">
but that it was clogged and impeded in its operations, during the fir&s;t twenty years of life, by the weakne&s;s, or hebe|tude, of the organs in which it was en|clo&s;ed. As we &s;hall all be di&s;po&s;ed to agree, that God is the creator of mind as well as of body; and as they both &s;eem to be forming and unfolding them&s;elves at the &s;ame time; it cannot appear in|con&s;i&s;tent either with rea&s;on or revela|tion, if it appear to be con&s;i&s;tent with the phenomena of nature, to &s;uppo&s;e that God is con&s;tantly occupied in form|ing mind out of matter, and that the various impre&s;sions that man receives through life, is the proce&s;s for that pur|po&s;e. The employment is &s;urely worthy of the highe&s;t attributes of the Deity.</P>
<P>This view of the &s;tate of man on earth will not &s;eem to be unattended with probability, if, judging from the little
<PB N="356" REF="372">
experience we have of the nature of mind, it &s;hall appear, upon inve&s;tigation, that the phenomena around us, and the various events of human life, &s;eem pecu|liarly calculated to promote this great end: and e&s;pecially, if, upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, we can account, even to our own narrow under&s;tandings, for many of tho&s;e roughne&s;&s;es and inequalities in life, which querulous man too frequently makes the &s;ubject of his complaint again&s;t the God of nature.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great awakeners of the mind &s;eem to be the wants of the body <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was my intention to have entered at &s;ome length into this &s;ubject, as a kind of &s;econd part to the e&s;&s;ay. A long interruption, from particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s, has obliged me to lay a&s;ide this intention, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent. I &s;hall now, therefore, only give a &s;ketch of a few of the leading circum&s;tances that appear to me to favour the general &s;uppo&s;ition that I have advanced.</NOTE>.
<PB N="357" REF="373">
They are the fir&s;t &s;timulants that rou&s;e the brain of infant man into &s;entient activity: and &s;uch &s;eems to be the &s;lug|gi&s;hne&s;s of original matter, that unle&s;s, by a peculiar cour&s;e of excitements, other wants, equally powerful, are generated, the&s;e &s;timulants &s;eem, even afterwards, to be nece&s;&s;ary, to continue that activity which they fir&s;t awakened. The &s;avage would &s;lumber for ever under his tree, unle&s;s he were rou&s;ed from his torpor by the cravings of hunger, or the pinchings of cold; and the exertions that he makes to avoid the&s;e evils, by procuring food, and building him&s;elf a covering, are the exerci&s;es which form and keep in mo|tion his faculties, which otherwi&s;e would &s;ink into li&s;tle&s;s inactivity. From all that experience has taught us concerning the &s;tructure of the human mind, if tho&s;e &s;timulants to exertion, which ari&s;e from the wants of the body, were removed
<PB N="358" REF="374">
from the ma&s;s of mankind, we have much more rea&s;on to think, that they would be &s;unk to the level of brutes, from a deficiency of excitements, than that they would be rai&s;ed to the rank of phi|lo&s;ophers by the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of lei&s;ure. In tho&s;e countries, where nature is the mo&s;t redundant in &s;pontaneous produce, the inhabitants will not be found the mo&s;t remarkable for acutene&s;s of intellect. Nece&s;sity has been with great truth called the mother of invention. Some of the noble&s;t exertions of the human mind have been &s;et in motion by the nece&s;sity of &s;atisfying the wants of the body. Want has not unfrequently given wings to the imagination of the poet; pointed the flowing periods of the hi&s;torian; and added acutene&s;s to the re&s;earches of the philo&s;opher: and though there are un|doubtedly many minds at pre&s;ent, &s;o far improved by the various excitements of
<PB N="359" REF="375">
knowledge, or of &s;ocial &s;ympathy, that they would not relap&s;e into li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, if their bodily &s;timulants were removed; yet, it can &s;carcely be doubted, that the&s;e &s;timulants could not be withdrawn from the ma&s;s of mankind, without pro|ducing a general and fatal torpor, de|&s;tructive of all the germs of future im|provement.</P>
<P>Locke, if I recollect, &s;ays, that the endeavour to avoid pain, rather than the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, is the great &s;timulus to action in life: and that in looking to any particular plea&s;ure, we &s;hall not be rou&s;ed into action in order to obtain it, till the contemplation of it has continued &s;o long, as to amount to a &s;en&s;ation of pain or unea&s;ine&s;s under the ab&s;ence of it. To avoid evil, and to pur&s;ue good, &s;eem to be the great duty and bu&s;ine&s;s of man; and this world appears to be
<PB N="360" REF="376">
peculiarly calculated to afford opportu|nity of the mo&s;t unremitted exertion of this kind: and it is by this exertion, by the&s;e &s;timulants, that mind is formed. If Locke's idea be ju&s;t, and there is great rea&s;on to think that it is, evil &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to create exertion; and ex|ertion &s;eems evidently nece&s;&s;ary to create mind.</P>
<P>The nece&s;sity of food for the &s;upport of life, gives ri&s;e, probably, to a greater quantity of exertion, than any other want, bodily or mental. The &s;upreme Being has ordained, that the earth &s;hall not produce food in great quantities, till much preparatory labour and inge|nuity has been exerci&s;ed upon its &s;urface. There is no conceivable connection to our comprehen&s;ions, between the &s;eed, and the plant, or tree, that ri&s;es from it. The Supreme Creator might, undoubtedly,
<PB N="361" REF="377">
rai&s;e up plants of all kinds, for the u&s;e of his creatures, without the a&s;si&s;tance of tho&s;e little bits of matter, which we call &s;eed, or even without the a&s;si&s;ting la|bour and attention of man. The proce&s;&s;es of ploughing and clearing the ground, of collecting and &s;owing &s;eeds, are not &s;urely for the a&s;si&s;tance of God in his creation; but are made previou&s;ly nece&s;|&s;ary to the enjoyment of the ble&s;sings of life, in order to rou&s;e man into action, and form his mind to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To furni&s;h the mo&s;t unremitted excite|ments of this kind, and to urge man to further the gracious de&s;igns of Providence, by the full cultivation of the earth, it has been ordained, that population &s;hould in|crea&s;e much fa&s;ter than food. This ge|neral law, (as it has appeared in the for|mer parts of this e&s;&s;ay) undoubtedly pro|duces much partial evil; but a little re|flection
<PB N="362" REF="378">
may, perhaps, &s;atisfy us, that it produces a great overbalance of good. Strong excitements &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to create exertion; and to direct this exer|tion, and form the rea&s;oning faculty, it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the Su|preme Being &s;hould act always according to general laws. The con&s;tancy of the laws of nature, or the certainty, with which we may expect the &s;ame effect, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, is the foundation of the faculty of rea&s;on. If in the or|dinary cour&s;e of things, the finger of God were frequently vi&s;ible; or to &s;peak more correctly, if God were frequently to change his purpo&s;e, (for the finger of God is, indeed, vi&s;ible in every blade of gra&s;s that we &s;ee) a general and fatal torpor of the human faculties would pro|bably en&s;ue; even the bodily wants of mankind would cea&s;e to &s;timulate them to exertion, could they not rea&s;onably
<PB N="363" REF="379">
expect, that if their efforts were well directed, they would be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The con&s;tancy of the laws of nature, is the foundation of the indu&s;try and fore&s;ight of the hu&s;bandman; the indefatigable ingenuity of the artificer; the &s;kilful re&s;earches of the phy&s;ician, and anatomi&s;t; and the watchful ob&s;er|vation, and patient inve&s;tigation, of the natural philo&s;opher. To this con&s;tancy, we owe all the greate&s;t, and noble&s;t ef|forts of intellect. To this con&s;tancy, we owe the immortal mind of a Newton.</P>
<P>As the rea&s;ons, therefore, for the con|&s;tancy of the laws of nature, &s;eem, even to our under&s;tandings, obvious and &s;trik|ing; if we return to the principle of po|pulation, and con&s;ider man as he really is, inert, &s;luggi&s;h, and aver&s;e from la|bour, unle&s;s compelled by nece&s;sity, (and it is &s;urely the height of folly to talk of
<PB N="364" REF="380">
man, according to our crude fancies, of what he might be) we may pronounce, with certainty, that the world would not have been peopled, but for the &s;u|periority of the power of population to the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Strong, and con&s;tantly operative as this &s;timulus is on man, to urge him to the cultivation of the earth; if we &s;till &s;ee that cultivation proceeds very &s;lowly, we may fairly con|clude, that a le&s;s &s;timulus would have been in&s;ufficient. Even under the ope|ration of this con&s;tant excitement, &s;avages will inhabit countries of the greate&s;t na|tural fertility, for a long period, before they betake them&s;elves to pa&s;turage or agriculture. Had population and food increa&s;ed in the &s;ame ratio, it is proba|ble that man might never have emerged from the &s;avage &s;tate. But &s;uppo&s;ing the earth once well peopled, an Alexander, a Julius Cae&s;ar, a Tamerlane, or a bloody revolution, might irrecoverably thin the
<PB N="365" REF="381">
human race, and defeat the great de&s;igns of the Creator. The ravages of a con|tagious di&s;order would be felt for ages; and an earthquake might unpeople a region for ever. The principle, accord|ing to which population increa&s;es, pre|vents the vices of mankind, or the ac|cidents of nature, the partial evils ari&s;ing from general laws, from ob&s;tructing the high purpo&s;e of the creation. It keeps the inhabitants of the earth always fully up to the level of the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and is con&s;tantly acting upon man as a powerful &s;timulus, urging him to the further cultivation of the earth, and to enable it, con&s;equently, to &s;up|port a more extended population. But it is impo&s;sible that this law can ope|rate, and produce the effects apparently intended by the Supreme Being, without occa&s;ioning partial evil. Unle&s;s the prin|ciple of population were to be altered,
<PB N="366" REF="382">
according to the circum&s;tances of each &s;eparate country, (which would not only be contrary to our univer&s;al experience, with regard to the laws of nature, but would contradict even our own rea&s;on, which &s;ees the ab&s;olute nece&s;sity of ge|neral laws, for the formation of intellect;) it is evident, that the &s;ame principle, which, &s;econded by indu&s;try, will peo|ple a fertile region in a few years, mu&s;t produce di&s;tre&s;s in countries that have been long inhabited.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, however, every way proba|ble, that even the acknowledged diffi|culties occa&s;ioned by the law of popula|tion, tend rather to promote, than im|pede the general purpo&s;e of Providence. They excite univer&s;al exertion, and con|tribute to that infinite variety of &s;itua|tions, and con&s;equently of impre&s;sions, which &s;eems, upon the whole, favoura|ble
<PB N="367" REF="383">
to the growth of mind. It is proba|ble, that too great, or too little excite|ment, extreme poverty, or too great riches, may be alike unfavourable in this re&s;pect. The middle regions of &s;ociety &s;eem to be be&s;t &s;uited to intellectual im|provement; but it is contrary to the analogy of all nature, to expect that the whole of &s;ociety can be a middle region. The temperate zones of the earth, &s;eem to be the mo&s;t favourable to the mental, and corporeal energies of man; but all cannot be temperate zones. A world, warmed and enlightened but by one &s;un, mu&s;t, from the laws of matter, have &s;ome parts chilled by perpetual fro&s;ts, and others &s;corched by perpetual heats. Every piece of matter lying on a &s;urface, mu&s;t have an upper, and an under &s;ide: all the particles cannot be in the middle. The mo&s;t valuable parts of an oak, to a timber merchant, are not either the roots,
<PB N="368" REF="384">
or the branches; but the&s;e are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the middle part, or &s;tem, which is the object in re|que&s;t. The timber merchant could not po&s;sibly expect to make an oak grow without roots or branches; but if he could find out a mode of cultivation, which would cau&s;e more of the &s;ub&s;tance to go to &s;tem, and le&s;s to root and branch, he would be right to exert him|&s;elf in bringing &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem into gene|ral u&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, though we can|not po&s;sibly expect to exclude riches, and poverty, from &s;ociety; yet if we could find out a mode of government, by which, the numbers in the extreme re|gions would be le&s;&s;ened, and the num|bers in the middle regions increa&s;ed, it would be undoubtedly our duty to adopt it. It is not, however, improbable, that
<PB N="369" REF="385">
as in the oak, the roots and branches could not be dimini&s;hed very greatly, without weakening the vigorous circula|tion of the &s;ap in the &s;tem; &s;o in &s;o|ciety, the extreme parts could not be dimini&s;hed beyond a certain degree, without le&s;&s;ening that animated exertion throughout the middle parts, which is the very cau&s;e, that they are the mo&s;t favourable to the growth of intellect. If no man could hope to ri&s;e, or fear to fall, in &s;ociety; if indu&s;try did not bring with it its reward, and idlene&s;s its puni&s;h|ment, the middle parts would not cer|tainly be what they now are. In rea&s;on|ing upon this &s;ubject, it is evident, that we ought to con&s;ider chiefly the ma&s;s of mankind, and not individual in&s;tances. There are undoubtedly many minds, and there ought to be many, according to the chances, out of &s;o great a ma&s;s, that, having been vivified early, by a peculiar
<PB N="370" REF="386">
cour&s;e of excitements, would not need the con&s;tant action of narrow motives, to continue them in activity. But if we were to review the various u&s;eful di&s;co|veries, the valuable writings, and other laudable exertions of mankind; I believe we &s;hould find, that more were to be attributed to the narrow motives that operate upon the many, than to the ap|parently more enlarged motives that ope|rate upon the few.</P>
<P>Lei&s;ure is, without doubt, highly va|luable to man; but taking man, as he is, the probability &s;eems to be, that in the greater number of in&s;tances, it will produce evil rather than good. It has been not unfrequently remarked, that talents are more common among younger brothers, than among elder brothers; but it can &s;carcely be imagined, that younger brothers are, upon an average, born with
<PB N="371" REF="387">
a greater original &s;u&s;ceptibility of parts. The difference, if there really is any ob|&s;ervable difference, can only ari&s;e from their different &s;ituations. Exertion and activity, are in general ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary in the one ca&s;e, and are only op|tional in the other.</P>
<P>That the difficulties of life, contribute to generate talents, every days experience mu&s;t convince us. The exertions that men find it nece&s;&s;ary to make, in order to &s;upport them&s;elves or families, fre|quently awaken faculties, that might otherwi&s;e have lain for ever dormant: and it has been commonly remarked, that new and extraordinary &s;ituations ge|nerally create minds adequate to grapple with the difficulties in which they are involved.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;orrows and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life form another cla&s;s of excitements, which &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary, by a peculiar train of impre&s;sions, to &s;often and humanize the heart, to awaken &s;ocial &s;ympathy, to generate all the Chri&s;tian virtues, and to afford &s;cope for the ample exertion of benevolence. The general tendency
<PB N="373" REF="389">
of an uniform cour&s;e of pro&s;perity is, rather to degrade, than exalt the cha|racter. The heart that has never known &s;orrow it&s;elf, will &s;eldom be feelingly alive, to the pains and plea&s;ures, the wants and wi&s;hes, of its fellow beings. It will &s;eldom be overflowing with that warmth of brotherly love, tho&s;e kind and amiable affections, which dignify the human character, even more than the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the highe&s;t talents. Ta|lents, indeed, though undoubtedly a very prominent and fine feature of mind, can by no means be con&s;idered as con&s;tituting the whole of it. There are many minds which have not been expo&s;ed to tho&s;e ex|citements, that u&s;ually form talents, that have yet been vivified to a high degree, by the excitements of &s;ocial &s;ympathy. In every rank of life, in the lowe&s;t, as frequently as in the highe&s;t, characters are to be found, overflowing with the
<PB N="374" REF="390">
milk of human kindne&s;s, breathing love to|wards God and man; and though with|out tho&s;e peculiar powers of mind called talents, evidently holding a higher rank in the &s;cale of beings, than many who po&s;&s;e&s;s them. Evangelical charity, meek|ne&s;s, piety, and all that cla&s;s of virtues, di&s;tingui&s;hed particularly by the name of Chri&s;tian virtues, do not &s;eem nece&s;&s;a|rily to include abilities; yet a &s;oul po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e amiable qualities, a &s;oul awakened and vivified by the&s;e delight|ful &s;ympathies, &s;eems to hold a nearer commerce with the &s;kies, than mere acutene&s;s of intellect.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t talents have been fre|quently mi&s;applied, and have produced evil proportionate to the extent of their powers. Both rea&s;on and revelation &s;eem to a&s;&s;ure us, that &s;uch minds will be con|demned to eternal death; but while on
<PB N="375" REF="391">
earth, the&s;e vicious in&s;truments performed their part in the great ma&s;s of impre&s;|&s;ions, by the di&s;gu&s;t and abhorrence which they excited. It &s;eems highly probable, that moral evil is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the production of moral excellence. A being with only good placed in view, may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be impelled by a blind nece&s;sity. The pur&s;uit of good in this ca&s;e, can be no indication of virtuous propen&s;ities. It might be &s;aid, perhaps, that Infinite Wi&s;dom, cannot want &s;uch an indication as outward action, but would foreknow, with certainty, whe|ther the being would chu&s;e good or evil. This might be a plau&s;ible argu|ment again&s;t a &s;tate of trial; but will not hold again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition, that mind in this world is in a &s;tate of form|ation. Upon this idea, the being that has &s;een moral evil, and has felt di&s;appro|bation and di&s;gu&s;t at it, is e&s;&s;entially
<PB N="376" REF="392">
different from the being that has &s;een only good. They are pieces of clay that have received di&s;tinct impre&s;sions: they mu&s;t, therefore, nece&s;&s;arily be in different &s;hapes; or, even if we allow them both to have the &s;ame lovely form of virtue, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that one has under|gone the further proce&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary to give firmne&s;s and durability to its &s;ub|&s;tance; while the other is &s;till expo&s;ed to injury, and liable to be broken by every accidental impul&s;e. An ardent love and admiration of virtue &s;eems to imply the exi&s;tence of &s;omething oppo|&s;ite to it; and it &s;eems highly probable, that the &s;ame beauty of form and &s;ub|&s;tance, the &s;ame perfection of character, could not be generated, without the impre&s;sions of di&s;approbation which ari&s;e from the &s;pectacle of moral evil.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="393">
When the mind has been awakened into activity by the pa&s;sions, and the wants of the body, intellectual wants ari&s;e; and the de&s;ire of knowledge, and the impatience under ignorance, form a new and important cla&s;s of excitements. Every part of nature &s;eems peculiarly cal|culated to furni&s;h &s;timulants to mental exertion of this kind, and to offer inex|hau&s;tible food for the mo&s;t unremitted inquiry. Our immortal Bard &s;ays of Cleopatra&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Cu&s;tom cannot &s;tale</L>
<L>Her infinite variety.</L></Q>
<P>The expre&s;sion, when applied to any one object, may be con&s;idered as a poetical amplification, but it is accurately true when applied to nature. Infinite variety, &s;eems, indeed, eminently her character|i&s;tic feature. The &s;hades that are here and there blended in the picture, give
<PB N="378" REF="394">
&s;pirit, life, and prominence to her exu|berant beauties; and tho&s;e roughne&s;&s;es and inequalities, tho&s;e inferior parts that &s;upport the &s;uperior, though they &s;ome|times offend the fa&s;tidious mi&s;cro&s;copic eye of &s;hort &s;ighted man, contribute to the &s;ymmetry, grace, and fair proportion of the whole.</P>
<P>The infinite variety of the forms and operations of nature, be&s;ides tending im|mediately to awaken and improve the mind by the variety of impre&s;sions that it creates, opens other fertile &s;ources of improvement, by offering &s;o wide and exten&s;ive a field for inve&s;tigation and re&s;earch. Uniform, undiver&s;ified perfec|tion, could not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame awaken|ing powers. When we endeavour then to contemplate the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; when we think of the &s;tars as the &s;uns of other &s;y&s;tems, &s;cattered throughout infinite &s;pace; when we reflect, that we
<PB N="379" REF="395">
do not probably &s;ee a millionth part of tho&s;e bright orbs, that are beaming light and life to unnumbered worlds; when our minds, unable to gra&s;p the im|mea&s;urable conception, &s;ink, lo&s;t and con|founded, in admiration at the mighty in|comprehen&s;ible power of the Creator; let us not querulou&s;ly complain that all climates are not equally genial; that perpe|tual &s;pring does not reign throughout the year; that all God's creatures do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame advantages; that clouds and tem|pe&s;ts &s;ometimes darken the natural world, and vice and mi&s;ery, the moral world; and that all the works of the creation are not formed with equal perfection. Both rea&s;on and experience &s;eem to indicate to us, that the infinite variety of nature, (and variety cannot exi&s;t without inferior parts, or apparent blemi&s;hes) is admira|bly adapted to further the high pur|po&s;e of the creation, and to produce the greate&s;t po&s;sible quantity of good.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="396">
The ob&s;curity that involves all meta|phy&s;ical &s;ubjects, appears to me, in the &s;ame manner peculiarly calculated, to add to that cla&s;s of excitements which ari&s;e from the thir&s;t of knowledge. It is probable that man, while on earth, will never be able to attain complete &s;atisfaction on the&s;e &s;ubjects; but this is by no means a rea&s;on that he &s;hould not engage in them. The darkne&s;s that &s;urrounds the&s;e intere&s;ting topics of hu|man curio&s;ity, may be intended to fur|ni&s;h endle&s;s motives to intellectual acti|vity and exertion. The con&s;tant effort to di&s;pel this darkne&s;s, even if it fail of &s;ucce&s;s, invigorates and improves the thinking faculty. If the &s;ubjects of hu|man inquiry were once exhau&s;ted, mind would probably &s;tagnate; but the in|finitely diver&s;ified forms and operations of nature, together with the endle&s;s food for &s;peculation which metaphy&s;ical &s;ub|jects
<PB N="381" REF="397">
offer, prevent the po&s;sibility that &s;uch a period &s;hould ever arrive.</P>
<P>It is by no means one of the wi&s;e&s;t &s;ayings of Solomon, that <Q>there is no new thing under the &s;un.</Q> On the con|trary, it is probable, that were the pre|&s;ent &s;y&s;tem to continue for millions of years, continual additions would be mak|ing to the ma&s;s of human knowledge; and yet, perhaps, it may be a matter of doubt, whether, what may be called the capacity of mind, be in any marked and decided manner increa&s;ing. A Socrates, a Plato, or an Ari&s;totle, however con|fe&s;&s;edly inferior in knowledge to the philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent day, do not appear to have been much below them in intellectual capacity. Intellect ri&s;es from a &s;peck, continues in vigour only for a certain period, and will not, per|haps, admit, while on earth, of above
<PB N="382" REF="398">
a certain number of impre&s;sions. The&s;e impre&s;sions may, indeed, be infinitely modified, and from the&s;e various modi|fications, added probably to a difference in the &s;u&s;ceptibility of the original germs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is probable that no two grains of wheat are exactly alike. Soil undoubtedly makes the prin|cipal difference in the blades that &s;pring up; but probably not all. It &s;eems natural to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome &s;ort of difference in the original germs that are af|terwards awakened into thought; and the extraor|dinary difference of &s;u&s;ceptibility in very young children &s;eems to confirm the &s;uppo&s;ition.</NOTE>, ari&s;e the endle&s;s diver&s;ity of character that we &s;ee in the world; but rea&s;on and experience &s;eem both to a&s;&s;ure us, that the capacity of indi|vidual minds does not increa&s;e in pro|portion to the ma&s;s of exi&s;ting know|ledge. The fine&s;t minds &s;eem to be formed rather by efforts at original
<PB N="383" REF="399">
thinking, by endeavours to form new combinations, and to di&s;cover new truths, than by pa&s;sively receiving the impre&s;|&s;ions of other men's ideas. Could we &s;up|po&s;e the period arrived, when there was no further hope of future di&s;coveries; and the only employment of mind was to ac|quire pre-exi&s;ting knowledge, without any efforts to form new and original combinations; though the ma&s;s of hu|man knowledge were a thou&s;and times greater than it is at pre&s;ent; yet it is evident that one of the noble&s;t &s;timu|lants to mental exertion would have cea&s;ed; the fine&s;t feature of intellect would be lo&s;t; every thing allied to ge|nius would be at an end; and it ap|pears to be impo&s;sible, that, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, any individuals could po&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;ame intellectual energies, as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a Locke, a Newton,
<PB N="384" REF="400">
or a Shake&s;pear, or even by a Socrates, a Plato, an Ari&s;totle, or a Homer.</P>
<P>If a revelation from heaven, of which no per&s;on could feel the &s;malle&s;t doubt, were to di&s;pel the mi&s;ts that now hang over metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects; were to ex|plain the nature and &s;tructure of mind, the affections and e&s;&s;ences of all &s;ub|&s;tances, the mode in which the Su|preme Being operates in the works of the creation, and the whole plan and &s;cheme of the Univer&s;e; &s;uch an ac|ce&s;sion of knowledge, &s;o obtained, in|&s;tead of giving additional vigour and activity to the human mind, would, in all probability, tend to repre&s;s future ex|ertion, and to damp the &s;oaring wings of intellect.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I have never con|&s;idered the doubts and difficulties that
<PB N="385" REF="401">
involve &s;ome parts of the &s;acred writings, as any argument again&s;t their divine original. The Supreme Being might, undoubtedly, have accompanied his re|velations to man by &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;sion of miracles, and of &s;uch a nature, as would have produced univer&s;al over|powering conviction, and have put an end at once to all he&s;itation and di&s;|cu&s;sion. But weak as our rea&s;on is to comprehend the plans of the Great Creator, it is yet &s;ufficiently &s;trong, to &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;triking objections to &s;uch a revelation. From the little we know of the &s;tructure of the human under&s;tanding, we mu&s;t be convinced, that an overpowering conviction of this kind, in&s;tead of tending to the improve|ment and moral amelioration of man, would act like the touch of a tor|pedo on all intellectual exertion, and
<PB N="386" REF="402">
would almo&s;t put at end to the exi&s;t|ence of virtue. If the &s;criptural denun|ciations of eternal puni&s;hment were brought home with the &s;ame certainty to every man's mind, as that the night will follow the day, this one va&s;t and gloomy idea would take &s;uch full po&s;|&s;e&s;sion of the human faculties, as to leave no room for any other concep|tions: the external actions of men would be all nearly alike: virtuous conduct would be no indication of virtuous di&s;|po&s;ition: vice and virtue would be blended together in one common ma&s;s; and, though the all-&s;eeing eye of God might di&s;tingui&s;h them, they mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily make the &s;ame impre&s;sions on man, who can judge only from ex|ternal appearances. Under &s;uch a di&s;|pen&s;ation, it is difficult to conceive how human beings could be formed to
<PB N="387" REF="403">
a dete&s;tation of moral evil, and a love and admiration of God, and of moral excellence.</P>
<P>Our ideas of virtue and vice are not, perhaps, very accurate and well-de|fined; but few, I think, would call an action really virtuous, which was per|formed &s;imply and &s;olely from the dread of a very great puni&s;hment, or the ex|pectation of a very great reward. The fear of the Lord is very ju&s;tly &s;aid to be the beginning of wi&s;dom; but the end of wi&s;dom is the love of the Lord, and the admiration of moral good. The denunciations of future puni&s;hment, contained in the &s;cripures, &s;eem to be well calculated to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the vicious, and awaken the attention of the carele&s;s; but we &s;ee, from repeated experience, that they are not accom|panied
<PB N="388" REF="404">
with evidence of &s;uch a nature, as to overpower the human will, and to make men lead virtuous lives with vicious di&s;po&s;itions, merely from a dread of hereafter. A genuine faith, by which I mean, a faith that &s;hews it&s;elf in all the virtues of a truly chri&s;tian life, may generally be con&s;idered as an indica|tion of an amiable and virtuous di&s;po|&s;ition, operated upon more by love than by pure unmixed fear.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the temptations to which man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ex|po&s;ed in this world, from the &s;tructure of his frame, and the operation of the laws of nature; and the con&s;equent moral certainty, that many ve&s;&s;els will come out of this mighty creative fur|nace in wrong &s;hapes; it is perfectly impo&s;sible to conceive, that any of the&s;e
<PB N="389" REF="405">
creatures of God's hand can be con|demned to eternal &s;uffering. Could we once admit &s;uch an idea, all our natural conceptions of goodne&s;s and ju&s;|tice would be completely overthrown; and we could no longer look up to God as a merciful and righteous Being. But the doctrine of life and immorta|lity which was brought to light by the go&s;pel, the doctrine that the end of righteou&s;ne&s;s is everla&s;ting life, but that the wages of &s;in are death, is in every re&s;|pect ju&s;t and merciful, and worthy of the Great Creator. Nothing can ap|pear more con&s;onant to our rea&s;on, than that tho&s;e beings which come out of the creative proce&s;s of the world in lovely and beautiful forms, &s;hould be crowned with immortality; while tho&s;e which come out mi&s;hapen, tho&s;e who&s;e minds are not &s;uited to a purer and
<PB N="390" REF="406">
happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence, &s;hould peri&s;h, and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemna|tion of this kind may be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of eternal puni&s;hment; and it is not wonderful that it &s;hould be repre&s;ented, &s;ometimes, under images of &s;uffering. But life and death, &s;alva|tion and de&s;truction, are more frequently oppo&s;ed to each other in the New Te&s;|tament, than happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. The Supreme Being would appear to us in a very different view, if we were to con&s;ider him as pur&s;uing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, in&s;tead of merely con|demning to their original in&s;en&s;ibility tho&s;e beings, that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities &s;uited to a purer &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="407">
Life is, generally &s;peaking, a ble&s;sing independent of a future &s;tate. It is a gift which the vicious would not always be ready to throw away, even if they had no fear of death. The partial pain, therefore, that is inflicted by the Su|preme Creator, while he is forming num|berle&s;s beings to a capacity of the highe&s;t enjoyments, is but as the du&s;t of the balance in compari&s;on of the hap|pine&s;s that is communicated; and we have every rea&s;on to think, that there is no more evil in the world, than what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as one of the ingredients in the mighty proce&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;triking nece&s;sity of general laws for the formation of intellect, will not in any re&s;pect be contradicted by one or two exceptions; and the&s;e evidently not intended for partial purpo&s;es, but
<PB N="392" REF="408">
calculated to operate upon a great part of mankind, and through many ages. Upon the idea that I have given of the formation of mind, the infringe|ment of the general laws of nature, by a divine revelation, will appear in the light of the immediate hand of God mixing new ingredients in the mighty ma&s;s, &s;uited to the particular &s;tate of the proce&s;s, and calculated to give ri&s;e to a new and powerful train of impre&s;sions, tending to purify, exalt, and improve the human mind. The miracles that accompanied the&s;e reve|lations when they had once excited the attention of mankind, and rendered it a matter of mo&s;t intere&s;ting di&s;cu&s;sion, whether the doctrine was from God or man, had performed their part, had an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the Creator; and the&s;e communications of the divine will were afterwards left to make their
<PB N="393" REF="409">
way by their own intrin&s;ic excellence; and by operating as moral motives, gra|dually to influence and improve, and not to overpower and &s;tagnate the fa|culties of man.</P>
<P>It would be, undoubtedly, pre&s;ump|tuous to &s;ay, that the Supreme Being could not po&s;sibly have effected his purpo&s;e in any other way than that which he has cho&s;en; but as the re|velation of the divine will, which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, is attended with &s;ome doubts and difficulties; and as our rea&s;on points out to us the &s;tronge&s;t objections to a revelation, which would force imme|diate, implicit, univer&s;al belief; we have &s;urely ju&s;t cau&s;e to think that the&s;e doubts and difficulties are no ar|gument again&s;t the divine origin of the &s;criptures; and that the &s;pecies of evi|dence which they po&s;&s;e&s;s is be&s;t &s;uited
<PB N="394" REF="410">
to the improvement of the human fa|culties, and the moral amelioration of mankind.</P>
<P>The idea that the impre&s;sions and excitements of this world are the in|&s;truments with which the Supreme Be|ing forms matter into mind; and that the nece&s;sity of con&s;tant exertion to avoid evil, and to pur&s;ue good, is the principal &s;pring of the&s;e impre&s;sions and excitements, &s;eems to &s;mooth many of the difficulties that occur in a contem|plation of human life; and appears to me, to give a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for the exi&s;tence of natural and moral evil; and, con&s;equently, for that part of both, and it certainly is not a very &s;mall part, which ari&s;es from the principle of population. But, though upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, it &s;eems highly improbable, that evil &s;hould ever be removed from
<PB N="395" REF="411">
the world; yet it is evident, that this impre&s;sion would not an&s;wer the appa|rent purpo&s;e of the Creator; it would not act &s;o powerfully as an excitement to exertion, if the quantity of it did not dimini&s;h or increa&s;e, with the acti|vity or the indolence of man. The continual variations in the weight, and in the di&s;tribution of this pre&s;&s;ure, keep alive a con&s;tant expectation of throw|ing it off.</P>
<Q><L>Hope &s;prings eternal in the human brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Man never is, but always to be ble&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>Evil exi&s;ts in the world, not to create de&s;pair, but activity. We are not pa|tiently to &s;ubmit to it, but to exert our&s;elves to avoid it. It is not only the intere&s;t, but the duty of every in|dividual, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t efforts to remove evil from him&s;elf, and from as large a circle as he can influence;
<PB N="396" REF="412">
and the more he exerci&s;es him&s;elf in this duty, the more wi&s;ely he directs his efforts, and the more &s;ucce&s;sful the&s;e efforts are; the more he will probably improve and exalt his own mind, and the more completely does he appear to fulfil the will of his Creator.</P>
