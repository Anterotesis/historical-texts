<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF the <HI>Convocation</HI> had been &s;it|ting,
I would have made this
Dedication to them, and
humbly implored of them,
what, for their Love to the Fathers,
they would readily have granted, a
Recommendation of the&s;e my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI>
on <HI>Miracles</HI> to the <HI>Clergy</HI>: But being
unhappily di&s;appointed of a Se&s;&s;ion of
that <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>Learned</HI> Body, for
who&s;e wi&s;e Debates and orthodox Votes
I have &s;uch a Veneration, as is not to
be expre&s;s'd in a few Words, I pre|&s;ently
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
turn'd my Thoughts on your
<HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> to whom a <HI>Dedication</HI> is due,
becau&s;e of your Re&s;pect, often declared,
for the Authority of the Fathers, which
induces me to think, you now approve
of the U&s;e I have made of them.</P>
<P>But what I am here to applaud your
<HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> for, is, your <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> call'd
<HI>Difficulties and Di&s;couragements,</HI> &amp;c.
That admirable Satire again&s;t modern
Orthodoxy and Per&s;ecution! How was
I tickled in the Peru&s;al of it! It is
plainly the Sen&s;e of your Soul, or you
had &s;et your Name to it: And if the
Temptation of Prai&s;e for it, had not
been too great to be re&s;i&s;ted, I could
have wi&s;h'd you had always conceal'd
your &s;elf; and then you had not writ|ten
again&s;t the Grain, an aukward Piece
on <HI>Church Power,</HI> like a Retractation,
to reingratiate your &s;elf with &s;ome Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
<HI>Noodles,</HI> whom you no
more, than I, need to care for.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes wondered, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> where and when the Great Mr.
<PB N="v" REF="4">
<HI>Grounds</HI> imbibed his notable Notions
about Religion and Liberty; for he
&s;uck'd them not in with his Mothers
Milk, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, train'd him up
in the Belief of Chri&s;tianity: But when
I con&s;ider'd, that he was once the <HI>Pupil</HI>
of Mr. <HI>Hare</HI> at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> my wonder
ceas'd. Under your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Tui|tion,
it &s;eems he laid the Foundation
of his di&s;tingui&s;h'd Learning and Opi|nions!
His Pupillage will be your im|mortal
Honour! I wonder, none of the
Writers again&s;t him have as yet cele|brated
your Prai&s;e for it! How does he
imitate and re&s;emble his <HI>Tutor</HI> in Princi|ples!
I can't &s;ay, he &s;urpa&s;&s;es you, &s;ince
there is &s;uch a Freedom of Thought and
Expre&s;&s;ion in your <HI>Difficulties,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o
&s;trongly &s;avouring of Infid<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ty, that
he has not as yet equall'd.</P>
<P>Upon your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Advancement
to a Bi&s;hoprick, <HI>Difficultys and Di&s;|couragements</HI>
not with&s;tanding, I wi&s;h'd,
without pre&s;cribing to the Wi&s;dom of
the Government in the choice of a
learned Prelate, that the great Mr.
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
<HI>Grounds,</HI> for the good of the Church
too, might be &s;oon con&s;ecrated: And
I &s;hould not have de&s;pair'd of it, but
that he's a Gentleman of real Probity
and Con&s;cience, and might po&s;&s;ibly
boggle at Sub&s;criptions, unle&s;s you and
Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadly</HI> could help him to &s;ome
of your <HI>Re&s;erves</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tinctions,</HI>
wherewith you mu&s;t be both well
Stock'd, to overcome that <HI>Difficulty.</HI>
And why &s;hould not <HI>Dean Swift</HI> for his
Writings, as well as &s;ome others, be
made a Bi&s;hop? I &s;hould like to &s;ee
him one; if the <HI>then</HI> Right Reverend
Bi&s;hop <HI>Grounds</HI> would not think him,
for his <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> too loo&s;e in
the Faith, for his Company.</P>
<P>Don't imagine, <HI>My Lord,</HI> that I am
forming of Schemes for my &s;elf to be a
Bi&s;hop. Tho the&s;e my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> on
<HI>Miracles</HI> are of very great Merit, as
well as your Lord&s;hip's <HI>Difficulties,</HI> &amp;c.
yet you may be a&s;&s;ured, I have no &s;uch
View, when I tell you, that the Ho|nour,
the Fathers have exalted me to,
of a <HI>Moderator</HI> in this Controver&s;y,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
&s;ets me above all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Pre|ferment,
excepting the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hoprick</HI>
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> which I'm afraid will be
void, before the King is appri&s;ed of
my &s;ingular Worth and Qualifications
for it.</P>
<P>But however, if &s;uch excellent <HI>Pre|lates,</HI>
as <HI>Grounds, Hoadly, Swift, Hare</HI>
and <HI>my &s;elf</HI> were at the Head of Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
Affairs, what would we do?
What &s;hould we not do? What would
not this free-thinking Age expect from
us? Nothing le&s;s, than that, according
to our Principles, we &s;hould endeavour
to &s;et Mankind at perfect Liberty, and
to lay open the dirty Fences of the
Church, call'd Sub&s;criptions, which
are not only the Stain of a good Con|&s;cience,
but the <HI>Di&s;couragements,</HI> your
<HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> hints at, in the Study of the
Scriptures: And if we made a Pu&s;h
for an Act of P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t to turn the <HI>Clergy</HI>
to Gra&s;s, after King <HI>Henry</HI> VIIIth's
Monks and Fryars; where would be
the Harm of it? Nay, the Advantage
to the Publick, as well as to Religion,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
would be great, if their Revenues were
apply'd to the Payment of National
Debts; with a Re&s;erve to our &s;elves
(remember, <HI>My Lord</HI>) of large Emolu|ments
out of them, according to our
great Merits; otherwi&s;e worldly-wi&s;e
Men will repute us impolitick Fools,
which you and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadly,</HI> I humbly
pre&s;ume, will never endure the Re|proach
of.</P>
<P>So, hoping your Lord&s;hip will accept
of this Dedication to your Prai&s;e, in as
much Sincerity as it is written, I &s;ub|&s;cribe
my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>A FOURTH
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_NOW for a <HI>fourth</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e on
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles, which, as be|fore,
I begin with a Repetition
of the three general Heads, at
fir&s;t propo&s;ed to be treated on;
and they are,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;how, that the Miracles of heal|ing
all manner of bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was famed for, are none of the pro|per
Miracles of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; neither are
they &s;o much as a good Proof of his di|vine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove that the literal Hi&s;tory of
many of the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as record|ed
by the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> does imply Ab&s;ur|dities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities;
con&s;equently they, either in the whole
or in part, were never wrought, as it is
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives, of what would be my&s;teriou&s;ly,
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to a
Te&s;timony and Witne&s;s of his divine
Power; and to &s;how that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to tho&s;e he
then wrought in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but to the my|&s;tical
ones, he would do in the Spirit; of
which tho&s;e wrought in the Fle&s;h are but
mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>I am upon the &s;econd of the&s;e Heads,
and according to it, have, in my <HI>former
Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> taken into examination <HI>eight</HI>
of the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us, viz.</HI> tho&s;e:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="10">
1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel|lers
out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of his exorci&s;ing the <HI>Devils</HI> out of
the Mad-men, and &s;ending them into the
Herd of Swine.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had
an I&s;&s;ue of Blood, twelve Years.</P>
<P N="5">5. Of his curing a Woman that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of his telling the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman,
her fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adultere&s;s with another
Man.</P>
<P N="7">7. Of his cur&s;ing the Fig-tree for not
bearing Fruit out of &s;ea&s;on. And,</P>
<P N="8">8. Of his healing a Man of an Infirmity
at the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da.</HI></P>
<P>Whether it be not manife&s;t, that the
Literal and Evangelical Story of the&s;e
Miracles, from what I have argu'd and rea|&s;on'd
upon them, does not con&s;i&s;t of Ab|&s;urdities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibi|lities,
according to the Propo&s;ition before
us, let my Readers judge; and &s;o I come to
the Con&s;ideration of</P>
<P N="9">9. A ninth Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us, viz.</HI> that
 <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">John ix.</NOTE> of his giving &s;ight to a Man who was
<PB N="4" REF="11">
born blind, by the means of Eye-&s;alve,
made of Dirt and Spittle.</P>
<P>Blindne&s;s, as far as one may gue&s;s by
the Evangelical Hi&s;tory, was the Di&s;tem|per
that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> frequently exercis'd his
Power on: And there is no doubt to be
made, but he heal'd many of one Weak|ne&s;s,
Defect and Imperfection, or other in
their Eyes; but whether he wrought any
Miracle upon any, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have
cured, is uncertain. There are, as it's no|torious,
many kinds of Blindne&s;s, that are
incurable by Art or Nature; and there are
other kinds of it, that Nature and Art
will relieve a Man in. But whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
u&s;ed his healing Power again&s;t the former,
as well as the latter &s;ort of Blindne&s;s, is
more than can be affirm'd, or at lea&s;t proved
by our <HI>Divines.</HI> And unle&s;s we knew of
a certainty, that the &s;ore or blind Eyes,
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> cured, were ab&s;olutely out of the
reach of Art and Nature; <HI>Infidels</HI> will
imagine, and &s;ugge&s;t, that he was only
Ma&s;ter of a good Ointment for &s;ore Eyes,
and being &s;ucce&s;sful in the u&s;e of it, igno|rant
People would needs think, he wrought
Miracles.</P>
<P>The World is often ble&s;s'd with excel|lent
<HI>Oculi&s;ts,</HI> who thro' Study and Prac|tice
have attain'd to wonderful Skill in
Eye-Maladies, which, tho they are of va|rious
<PB N="5" REF="12">
&s;orts, yet, by Cu&s;tom of Speech,
all pa&s;s under the general Name of <HI>Blind|ne&s;s.</HI>
And &s;ometimes we hear of famous
<HI>Chance-Doctors,</HI> like <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who by a Gift
of God, Nature, or Fortune, without any
Skill in the Structure of the Eyes, have
been very &s;ucce&s;sful in the Cure of one
Di&s;temper or other incident to them: Such
was Sir <HI>William Read,</HI> who, tho no Scho|lar,
nor of acquir'd Abilities in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and
<HI>Surgery,</HI> yet cured his Thou&s;ands of &s;ore
or blind Eyes; and many of them too to
the &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment of profe&s;s'd
<HI>Surgeons</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI> Whether He, or
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> cured the greater number of Blind|ne&s;s
may be que&s;tion'd. To plea&s;e our
<HI>Divines,</HI> it &s;hall be granted that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> cu|red
the greater Numbers; but that he cu|red
wor&s;e or more difficult Di&s;tempers in
the Eyes, can't be proved. Sir <HI>William</HI>
indeed met with many Ca&s;es of blind and
&s;ore Eyes, that were out of the reach of
his Power; and &s;o did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> too, or he had
never let great Multitudes of the blind, and
otherwi&s;e di&s;temper'd People, go unheal'd
by him. Our <HI>Divines</HI> will here &s;ay, that
it was never want of Power in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but
want of Faith in the di&s;ea&s;ed, if he did
not heal them; but in other <HI>Surgeons</HI> and
<HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> it is confe&s;&s;edly their own In|&s;ufficiency:
To which I have only this
<PB N="6" REF="13">
An&s;wer, that our <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> and <HI>Surgeons</HI>
are to be commended for their Ingenuity,
to impute it to their own Defect of Power,
and not to lay the Blame upon their Pa|tients,
when they can't cure them: And
it is lucky for us Chri&s;tians, that we have
<HI>this Salvo</HI> for the Credit of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s mi|raculou&s;ly
healing Power, that it was not
fit, he &s;hould exert it again&s;t Unbelief;
otherwi&s;e, rea&s;onably &s;peaking, He, with
Sir <HI>William Read, Greatrex, Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI>
our former <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Seventh-Sons,</HI>
mu&s;t have pa&s;s'd but for a <HI>Chance-Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the particular Con&s;idera|tion
of the Miracle before us. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> re|&s;tored,
it &s;eems, a blind Man to his Eye-&s;ight,
by the u&s;e of a peculiar Ointment,
and wa&s;hing of his Eyes, as directed, in
the Pool of <HI>Siloam.</HI> Where lies the Mi|racle?
I can't &s;ee it; but hope our <HI>Di|vines</HI>
will take their opportunity to point
it out to me. Our <HI>Surgeons</HI> with their
Ointments and Wa&s;hings can cure &s;ore
and blind Eyes of one &s;ort or other; and
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> did no more here; and yet he mu&s;t
be reckon'd a Worker of Miracles; and they,
but artificial Operators: where's the Sen&s;e
and Rea&s;on of this difference between
them? If Mr. <HI>Moor,</HI> the <HI>Apothecary,</HI> for
the notable Cures he performs, by the
<PB N="7" REF="14">
means of his Medicines, &s;hould write him|&s;elf,
and be accounted by his Admirers, a
<HI>Miracle-worker</HI>; he and they would be
but laugh'd at for it: And yet <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for
his curing the &s;ore Eyes of a poor Man
with an Ointment, mu&s;t be had in ve|neration
for a divine and miraculous Ope|rator,
as much as if by the breath of his
Mouth, he had removed an huge Moun|tain!</P>
<P>A Miracle, if I mi&s;take not the Notion
of our <HI>Divines</HI> about it, is a &s;upernatural
Event, or a Work out of the Power of Na|ture
or Art to effect. And when it is &s;po|ken
of the Cure of a Di&s;ea&s;e, as of Blind|ne&s;s
or Lamene&s;s, it ought to be &s;o repre|&s;ented,
as that skilful and experienced <HI>Sur|geons</HI>
and <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> who can do &s;trange
and &s;urprizing Cures by Art, may give it
upon their Judgment, that no Skill of
Man could reach that Operation; but that
it ought to pa&s;s for the Work of a divine
and almighty Hand and Power: But
there is no &s;uch care taken in the De|&s;cription
of any of the Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> cured; much le&s;s of this before us;
again&s;t the miraculou&s;ne&s;s of which, con|&s;equently,
there are the&s;e two Exceptions
to be made:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That we know nothing of the
Nature of this poor Man's Blindne&s;s; nor
<PB N="8" REF="15">
what was the defect of his Eyes; nor whe|ther
it was curable by Art or not: With|out
which Knowledge, it is impo&s;&s;ible and
unrea&s;onable to a&s;&s;ert, that there was a
Miracle wrought in the Cure of him. If
his blindne&s;s or weakne&s;s of Eye-&s;ight
was curable by human means, and Je&s;us
did u&s;e tho&s;e means, there's an end of the
Miracle. If the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> had given us
an accurate De&s;cription of the Condition
of this Man's Eyes before Cure, we could
have judg'd better: But this is their con|&s;tant
neglect in all the Di&s;tempers <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
heal'd, and is enough to induce us to doubt
of his miraculous Power. There are, as I
have &s;aid, &s;ome &s;orts of &s;ore or blind Eyes
curable by Art, as Experience does te&s;tify;
and there are others incurable, as <HI>Phy&s;i|cians</HI>
and <HI>Patients</HI> do lament. Of which
&s;ort this Man's was, we know not. The
wor&s;t that we know of his Ca&s;e, is, that
he was blind from his Birth, or Infancy,
which might be; and yet Time, Nature
and Art, may give relief to him. As a
Man advances in Years, the di&s;ea&s;es of
Childhood and Youth wear off. What we
call the <HI>King's-Evil,</HI> or an Inflamation in
the Eyes, in time will abate of its Malig|nity.
Nature will not only by degrees
work the Cure it-&s;elf, but the &s;ea&s;onable
help of a good <HI>Oculi&s;t</HI> will &s;oon expedite
<PB N="9" REF="16">
it, tho in time of Infancy he could be of
no u&s;e. And who knows but this might
be the Ca&s;e of this blind Man, who&s;e
Cure <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by his Art did only ha&s;ten
and help forward. However, there are
Grounds enough to &s;u&s;pect, that it was
not divine Power which heal'd this Man,
or <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had never prepared and order'd
an <HI>Ointment</HI> and <HI>Wa&s;h</HI> for him.</P>
<P>Should our <HI>Divines</HI> &s;uppo&s;e or de|&s;cribe,
for the <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> a &s;tate of
Blindne&s;s in this Man, incurable by Art;
that would be begging the Que&s;tion,
which no Unbeliever will grant. But
to plea&s;e them, I will yield, without
Enquiry into the Nature of this Man's
Blindne&s;s, that, if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had u&s;ed no
Medicines; if with only a word of his
Mouth he had cured the Man, and he
had in&s;tantaneou&s;ly recover'd, as the Word
was &s;poken; here would have been a
real and great Miracle, let the Blindne&s;s
or Imperfection of the Man's Sight be|fore,
be of what kind or degree &s;oever.
But <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s u&s;e of Wa&s;hings and Oint|ments
ab&s;olutely &s;poils and de&s;troys the
Credit of the Miracle, and we ought
by no means to a&s;cribe <HI>that</HI> to the im|mediate
Hand and Power of God, which
<HI>Medicines</HI> and <HI>Bal&s;ams</HI> are apply'd to the
Effect of. And this brings me to the</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17">
<HI>Second</HI> Exception again&s;t the miracu|lou&s;ne&s;s
of the Cure of this blind Man,
which is, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> u&s;ed human means
for the Cure of him; which means,
whether they were at all proper and ef|fectual
in them&s;elves, do affect the Credit
of the Miracle, and give occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;|picion,
that it was Art and not divine
Power that heal'd him, or <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> for
his Honour, had never had recour&s;e to
the u&s;e of them. And what were tho&s;e
Means, or that Medicine, which <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
made u&s;e of? Why, "He &s;pit upon the
Ground, and made a Bal&s;am of Dirt
and Spittle, and anointed the poor
Man's Eyes with it, and he recover'd."
A &s;trange and odd &s;ort of an Ointment,
that I believe was never u&s;ed before, nor
&s;ince, for &s;ore and blind Eyes! I am
not Student enough in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Sur|gery</HI>
to account for the natural and ra|tional
u&s;e of this Bal&s;am; but wi&s;h that
skilful Profe&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e Sciences would
help me out at this difficulty. If they
could rationally account for the u&s;e of
this Eye-&s;alve, tho it was by &s;uppo&s;ing,
that Je&s;us imperceptibly had in his Mouth
a proper unctuous and bal&s;amick Sub|&s;tance,
which he di&s;&s;olv'd into Spittle,
they would do great &s;ervice to a certain
Cau&s;e; and I wonder none of them,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
whether well or ill affected to Religion,
have as yet bent their Thoughts to it.</P>
<P>In the Practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI>
there are &s;ometimes very odd and un|accountable
Medicaments made u&s;e of;
and now-and-then very whim&s;ical and
&s;eemingly ridiculous ones, by old Women,
to good Purpo&s;e: But none of them are
to be compared to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Bal&s;am for
&s;ore Eyes. I have heard of a merry
<HI>Mountebank</HI> of Di&s;tinction, who&s;e ca|tholick
Medicine was <HI>Ha&s;ty-Pudding,</HI>
which indeed is a notable Remedy again&s;t
the <HI>E&s;uriency</HI> of the Stomach, that the
Poor often labour under. But <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Eye-Salve, for ab&s;urdity, whim, and in|congruity,
was never equall'd, either in
je&s;t or in earne&s;t, by any <HI>Quack-Doctor.</HI>
Whether <HI>Infidels</HI> think of this Ointment
of the Holy <HI>Je&s;us</HI> with a &s;mile; or re|flect

would &s;ooner put a Man's Eyes out,
than re&s;tore a blind one to his Sight. And
I believe that our <HI>Divines,</HI> for the Cre|dit
of the Miracle, and our <HI>Surgeons,</HI>
for the Honour of their Science, will
<PB N="12" REF="19">
agree, that it could not be naturally ope|rative

cured the Man with a word &s;peaking?
This is a Que&s;tion and Objection in St.

a more &s;anative Bal&s;am, that he &s;ubtilly
&s;lip't in the room of the Clay, and re|peatedly
to good purpo&s;e anointed the
Man's Eyes with it. But as the Autho|rity
of the Fathers, and their my&s;tical
Interpretation of this Story, is alone my
<PB N="15" REF="22">
&s;afe-guard again&s;t &s;uch an ill opinion of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>; &s;o I would now gladly know
upon what Bottom the Faith of our

<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s divine Power in it.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed &s;ome of our <HI>Commen|tators</HI>
on the Place, and don't perceive
that they he&s;itate at this &s;trange Eye-Salve;

Whether it is, that they &s;leep over the
Story, or are aware of greater Difficultys

therefore dare not touch on't, I know
not. But now that we enjoy Liberty

of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s U&s;e of this Eye-Salve made
of Clay and Spittle? Whether, if it was
of &s;ervice to the Cure of the blind Man,
it does not de&s;troy the Miracle? And if
it had no Effect in the Cure of him,
whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was not a <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>trifling</HI>
Operator, making u&s;e of in&s;ignificant and

rational, and &s;ub&s;tantial An&s;wer is expec|ted
to them, &s;uch as will be a Vindi|cation
of the Wi&s;dom and Power of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> without any Diminution of the

<P>Should our <HI>Divines</HI> &s;ay, that this

will not do here. The Miracles of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> are, as our <HI>Divines</HI> own, Appeals
to our Rea&s;on and Sen&s;es for his Autho|rity;
and by our Rea&s;on and Sen&s;es they
are to be try'd, condemn'd or approved

of turning the <HI>Clergy</HI>'s Heads to the Con|&s;ideration
of My&s;terys, this Miracle &s;hould
have been pa&s;s'd by in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome antiently, whom St.
<HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Rur&s;us hoc in loco calumniantur nonnulli hunc ebrio&s;orum fui&s;&s;e Conventum, <HI>&amp;c. In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> writes of, whether <HI>Jews,</HI>
<HI>Gentiles,</HI> or <HI>Hereticks,</HI> I know not, who
took great offence at the Story of this
Wedding, accounting it, from what is re|lated
in St. <HI>John,</HI> as a riotous Fea&s;t,
and that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Mother, and his
Di&s;ciples, not only bore a part in the
Revellings, but were mo&s;t to blame for
them; or he &s;hould not have countenanced
them with his Pre&s;ence, much le&s;s pro|moted
them, by the Change of a large
quantity of Water into Wine for the u&s;e
of a Company, who were already <HI>drunk</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="32">
with it. But I, with St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> am
inclined to believe, that, if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did
grace this Wedding with his Pre&s;ence,
there was no Exce&s;s encouraged, or &s;o
much as &s;uffer'd at it. If he did accept
of the Invitation of the Bridegroom, it
was for an opportunity, not &s;o much to
turn <HI>Water</HI> into <HI>Wine,</HI> as to make a pro|per
Di&s;cour&s;e to the People of conjugal
Duties; and, as he was a &s;earcher of the
Hearts, &s;ecretly to admoni&s;h the Married
of the Sin and Mi&s;chief of Adultery;
tho we read not of a &s;ea&s;onable and
good Word &s;poken at it.</P>
<P>And the Empre&s;s <HI>Eudocia,</HI> a nur&s;ing
Mother of the Church, has given us a
Poetical, and I hope a fictitious De&s;crip|tion
of this Wedding. She makes a
&s;umptuous and voluptuous Fea&s;t of it;
and writes <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Pueri aut Saltatores volutabantur, in his autem Tibiae, Lyraeque Vocem habebant. Mulieres autem Cantum accipientes, volvebantur per medias Quaecunque optimatum erant uxores atque filiae. Ill vero ad Saltationem &amp; de&s;iderabilem Cantum Conver&s;i delectabantur, &amp;c.

in abundance, enough to make us think
of &s;uch Mirth and Pa&s;time here, as was
unbecoming of a Company of Saints to
be pre&s;ent at. Whether it was, that this
<PB N="26" REF="33">
<HI>Empre&s;s,</HI> being only accu&s;tom'd to the
Exce&s;&s;es of a Court, could form no mea|ner
Conceptions of a Country Wedding;
or whether &s;he had any extra-&s;criptural
Authority for what &s;he writ, I know
not: But I believe, that, if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was at
all at a Marriage-Fea&s;t, the whole was
conducted with Decency, Order, and So|briety;
and if he there wrought any
Miracle, it was to manife&s;t his Glory,
to the Conver&s;ion of &s;ome, and Confir|mation
of the Faith of others.</P>
<P>And our <HI>Tran&s;lators</HI> of the <HI>Bible</HI> too
have given occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome|what
of Exce&s;s at this Wedding; or
they need not have made the Waterpots
to hold two or three Firkins apiece. If
I had been the Tran&s;lator, they &s;hould
not have held above two or three <HI>Pints</HI>
apiece, which Mea&s;ure is as agreeable to
the Original as <HI>Firkin</HI>; neither can I
imagine, that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> if he did convert
Water into Wine, would do it in &s;o
large a Mea&s;ure, for fear of an intempe|rate
abu&s;e of it, but only gave the Com|pany
a ca&s;t of his miraculous Power,
and a little ta&s;te of his Love and Good|will
to them.</P>
<P>Such are the Conceptions, that, to the
Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I am willing to form
of this <HI>Wedding</HI>; and wi&s;h that the
<PB N="27" REF="34">
Letter of the Story did &s;ugge&s;t no wor&s;e
Thoughts of it to us. I &s;hould be pleas'd,
if no <HI>Infidel</HI> really could, what I, but
for the &s;ake of the My&s;tery mo&s;t un|willingly
&s;hould, write any ludicrous
De&s;cants on it. But if this Story had
been related of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> as
it is of our <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I would have ridi|cul'd
and &s;atiriz'd it to the utmo&s;t of
my Power, and have render'd him and
his Di&s;ciples of all Nations, as contemp|tible
as I could, for the Belief of it;
and I don't doubt, but our Chri&s;tian
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> would have given me ample Prai|&s;es
and Commendations for &s;o doing. It
is &s;aid of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> that for the Enter|tainment
of his Friends, he commanded
variety of nice Di&s;hes of Meat, together
with Bowls of choice&s;t Wine, all on a
&s;udden to de&s;cend upon his Table and
range them&s;elves in good Order. Whe|ther
there was any Truth in this Mira|cle
of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> is not the Que&s;tion;
but Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> p. 82.</NOTE> could &s;ee a Fault
in it, (tho none in <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Wine at this
Wedding) as if it was done for the Plea|&s;ure
of luxurious Appetites, tho we read
of no Intemperance at it, which can't be
&s;aid of the <HI>Wedding-Fea&s;t</HI> before us. Our
<PB N="28" REF="35">
<HI>Divines</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, no more than my&s;elf,
believe any thing of the &s;aid Miracle in
<HI>Apollonius</HI>; but, if it was really wrought,
I fancy, I could have lampoon'd him for
it, and would have made it a diabolical
Work, like that, as Fables go, of the
Fea&s;tings of <HI>Wizards</HI> and <HI>Witches</HI>; and
our <HI>Divines</HI> (pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>Wine</HI>
here) would readily, as they are Be|lievers
of the Storys of Witchcraft, have
&s;truck in with me.</P>
<P>But &s;etting a&s;ide that miraculous Story
of <HI>Apollonius,</HI> which has but <HI>one</HI> Voucher;
the Ca&s;e before us is <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>turning Wa|ter
into Wine</HI> for the u&s;e of Men, who
had before <HI>well drank.</HI> How &s;hall I
force Nature and Faith to ridicule this
Story? How &s;hall I lay a&s;ide that pro|found
Veneration for the Holy <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
which Conver&s;ation with the Fathers,
more than the Prejudice of Education
has begotten in me, and ludicrou&s;ly here
treat him and his Miracle too, as is in|cumbent
upon me, to make way for the
My&s;tery? In &s;hort, I can't do it, in my
own Name; but having met with a &s;ati|rical
Invective of a &s;uppo&s;ed Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbi</HI>
to this purpo&s;e, I here publi&s;h it, that
our <HI>Clergy,</HI> as well as my&s;elf, may
think of an An&s;wer to it, and &s;o pre|vent
that Mi&s;chief it may do by being
<PB N="29" REF="36">
handed about among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI>
in Manu&s;cript. It is as follows;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>You Chri&s;tians pay Adoration to
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> whom you believe to be a di|vine
Author of Religion, &s;ent of God
for the In&s;truction, Reformation and
Salvation of Mankind; and what in|duces
you to this Belief of him, is,
(be&s;ides &s;ome ob&s;cure Prophecies, which
you can't agree upon, and which nei|ther
your &s;elves, nor any body el&s;e
under&s;tands the Application of) the
Hi&s;tory of his Miracles: But I won|der,
you &s;hould have a good opinion
of him for his Miracles, which, if he
wrought no better than what are re|corded
of him, by your <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI>
are, if duly con&s;ider'd, enough to a|lienate
your Hearts from him. I can't
&s;pare time now to examine into all of
them, but according to the cur&s;ory
Ob&s;ervation I have made on them, there
is not one &s;o well circum&s;tanced, as to
merit a con&s;iderate Man's belief, that
it was the Work of an omnipotent,
all-wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good Agent. Some
of them are ab&s;urd Tales, others foo|li&s;h
Facts, others unju&s;t Actions, others
ludicrous Pranks, others jugling Tricks,
others magical Enchantments; and if
<PB N="30" REF="37">
many of them had been better and
greater Operations than they are, and
of a more u&s;eful and &s;tupendous na|ture
than they &s;eem to be; yet the
fir&s;t Miracle that he wrought, <HI>viz.</HI>
that of his <HI>turning Water into Wine</HI>
at an extravagant and voluptuous Wed|ding
at <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> is enough to
turn our Stomachs again&s;t all the re&s;t.
It is in it&s;elf enough to beget in us
an ill opinion of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s
us with an aver&s;ion to his Religion,
without farther Examination into it.
It is enough to make us &s;u&s;pect his o|ther
Miracles, of what name &s;oever,
to be of a ba&s;e, magical, and diaboli|cal
Extraction; or he had never &s;et
up for a divine worker of Miracles
with &s;o ill a grace. Would any &s;o|ber,
grave, &s;erious and divine Per&s;on,
as you Chri&s;tians &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to have
been, have vouch&s;af'd his Pre&s;ence at
a Wedding, where &s;uch Levities, Di|ver&s;ions
and Exce&s;&s;es (in our Nation of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as in all others)
were indulg'd on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as
were not fit to be &s;een, much le&s;s
countenanc'd by the <HI>Saint,</HI> you would
make of him. If your <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his Mo|ther,
and his Di&s;ciples had not been
merry Folks in them&s;elves, they would
<PB N="31" REF="38">
have declined the Invitation of the
<HI>Bridegroom</HI>; nay, if they had been at
all graver and more &s;erious People
than ordinary, no Invitation had been
given to &s;uch <HI>Spoil-Sports</HI>: But boon
Companions they were, and of comi|mical
Conver&s;ation, or there had been
at a Wedding no room for them. You
Chri&s;tians may fancy, what you plea&s;e,
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Mother's Saint&s;hip;
but the very Text of the Story im|plies,
they were Lovers of good Fel|low&s;hip
and Exce&s;s too, upon occa|&s;ion;
or he had never, upon her Inti|mation,
turn'd &s;o large a quantity of
Water into Wine, after all or mo&s;t of
the Company were far gone with it.
You may &s;uppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, that
all were &s;ober, and none intoxicated,
and that the want of Wine pro|ceeded
from the abundance of Com|pany,
rather than exce&s;s in drinking;
but why then did <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evange|li&s;t</HI>
u&s;e the word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which im|plies,
they were more than half &s;eas
over? And if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Mother
had not both a mind to <HI>top</HI> them up;
the one would not have reque&s;ted, nor
the other have granted a Miracle to
that purpo&s;e. Whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his
Mother them&s;elves were at all <HI>cut,</HI> as
<PB N="32" REF="39">
were others of the Company, is not
&s;o certain. She might be an ab&s;temi|ous
Dame for ought we know; tho if
old Stories are true of her familiarity
with a <HI>Soldier,</HI> of whom came her
<HI>chara De&ucirc;m Soboles,</HI> in all probabi|lity
&s;he would take a <HI>Dram</HI> and a <HI>Bot|tle</HI>
too. But it looks as if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him|&s;elf
was a little <HI>in</HI> for't, or he had
never &s;poke &s;o wa&s;pi&s;hly and &s;nap|pi&s;hly
to his Mother, &s;aying, <HI>Woman,</HI>
<HI>what have I to do with thee? mine
Hour is not yet come:</HI> which was ve|ry
unbecoming of a dutiful Son, who,
excepting when he ran away from
his Parents, and put them to <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 48.</NOTE> 
<HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Trouble</HI> to look him up,
was, and is &s;till in Heaven, &s;ay the
<HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> a mo&s;t obedient Child.
You modern Chri&s;tians may put what
Con&s;truction you can upon the words
above of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to his Mother, to &s;alve
his Credit; but the Fathers of your
Church <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tus a&s;perius re&s;pondit, quid tibi &amp; mihi, Mulier? <HI>St. Chry&s;o&s;t. in Loc. Johan.</HI> Vide &amp; <HI>Theophy|lact. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> confe&s;s them to be a &s;harp
and &s;urly Reply to her, which, if it
did not proceed from the natural bad|ne&s;s0
<PB N="33" REF="40">
of his Temper, derived, <HI>ex traduce,</HI>
from his &s;uppo&s;ed Father yet, was cer|tainly
the effect of Drinking; and
that's the more likely, becau&s;e it is
a <HI>broken</HI> and <HI>witle&s;s</HI> Sentence, &s;uch as
<HI>Fuddlecaps</HI> utter by halves, when the
<HI>Wine's in,</HI> and the <HI>Wit's out.</HI> Your
modern <HI>Commentators</HI> are &s;adly puz|zled
to make good Sen&s;e of this bro|ken
and abrupt Sentence of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and
a pertinent Reply of it, to what his
Mother &s;aid to him, <HI>they have no
Wine:</HI> If you will bear with me, I'll
help you out at this dead lift, and
give you the true meaning of it <HI>thus.
Je&s;us</HI>'s Mother being appri&s;ed of a
deficiency of Wine, and willing, as well
as the <HI>Bridegroom,</HI> that the Company
&s;hould be thorowly merry before they
parted, intimates to her Son, (whom
&s;he knew to be initiated in the My|&s;terys
of <HI>Bacchus</HI>) <HI>that they had no
Wine:</HI> But before &s;he could fini&s;h her
Reque&s;t to him, He, mi&s;taking her
meaning, imagines, &s;he was caution|ing
again&s;t drinking more Wine, and
exhorting him to go home, where|upon
he takes her up &s;hort and quick,
&s;aying, <HI>Woman, what have you to do
with me?</HI> (for that too is the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
of the <HI>Greek</HI>) I'll not be interrupted
<PB N="34" REF="41">
in my Cups, nor break Company
<HI>for mine Hour is not yet come</HI> to de|part:
But after he rightly apprehend|ed
her, he goes to work, and rather
than the Company &s;hould want their
fill, by trick of Art, like a <HI>Punch|maker,</HI>
meliorates Water into what they
call'd Wine. That this is the obvious
Interpretation, and natural Paraphra&s;e
of the Words before us, &s;hall be try'd
by the ab&s;urd Comments now-a-days
put upon them, that are enough to
make a con&s;iderate Man laugh, if not
hi&s;s at them.</P>
<P>Some antient Hereticks <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Vide Sanctum Augu&s;tinum. <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> , very
gravely infer'd from this Expre&s;&s;ion,
<HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee,</HI>
that <HI>Mary</HI> was neither a Virgin, nor
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> her Son; or he had never ac|co&s;ted
her with &s;uch blunt Language,
that implys, they could not be &s;o a|kin
to each other. This was a per|plexity
to St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> and gave him
&s;ome trouble to explain the Expre&s;|&s;ion,
con&s;i&s;tently with her Virginity
(for all &s;he cohabited with the old Car|penter)
and his Filiation. But this
being a quibble, that has been long
&s;ince dropt, I &s;hall not revive, nor in|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="42">
on it. But that the Expre&s;&s;ion
above do's &s;uppo&s;e a little Inebriation
in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I may averr, neither is
there a better Solution to be made of
it.</P>
<P>The Fathers of your Church, be|ing
&s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity, abrupt|ne&s;s,
impertinence, pertne&s;s, and &s;en&s;le&s;|ne&s;s
of the Pa&s;&s;age before us accord|ing
to the Letter, had recour&s;e to
a my&s;tical and allegorical Interpreta|tion,
as the only way to make it con|&s;i&s;tent
with the Wi&s;dom, Sobriety and
Duty of the Holy <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> But you
<HI>Moderns,</HI> abandoning Allegories and
My&s;teries in Miracles, have endea|vour'd,
I &s;ay, to put other Con&s;truc|tions
upon it, as may comport with
the Letter and Credit of Je&s;us: But
how in&s;ipid and &s;en&s;le&s;s they are,
I appeal to a rea&s;onable Man, who
will give him&s;elf the trouble to con|&s;ult
them, upon the Place, and &s;ave
me the pains of a tedious and nau|&s;eous
Work to recount them for him.</P>
<P>But to humour the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t|hood
at this Day, I will &s;uppo&s;e that
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and his Mother, and Di&s;ciples,
tho Fi&s;hermen, to have been all &s;ober,
grave, and &s;erious at this Wedding,
&s;uitably to the Opinion that their Fol|lowers
<PB N="36" REF="43">
now would have us to enter|tain
of them. But then it is hard
to conceive them, le&s;s than Spectators
and even Encouragers of Exce&s;s and
Intemperance in others; or <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> af|ter
their more than &s;ufficient drink|ing
for the &s;atisfaction of Nature,
had never turn'd Water into Wine,
nor would his Mother have reque&s;ted
him to do it, if, I &s;ay, they had not
a mind, and took Plea&s;ure in it too, to
&s;ee the Company quite <HI>&s;titch'd up.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;ober, prudent and wi&s;e Philo&s;o|pher
or <HI>Magician,</HI> in the place of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> if he had an Art or Power to
turn Water into Wine, would never
have exercis'd it upon &s;uch an occa|&s;ion;
no, not to plea&s;e his be&s;t Friends,
nor in obedience to the mo&s;t indul|gent
Parent. What would he have
&s;aid in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? That the Com|pany
had drank &s;ufficiently already,
and there was no need of more Wine:
The Bridegroom had kindly and plen|tifully
entertain'd his Gue&s;ts, and he
would not for the Honour of God,
who had endow'd him with a divine
Power, be at the Expence of a Mi|racle
to promote the lea&s;t Intemperance.
Whether &s;uch a Speech and Re&s;olu|tion
in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> upon this occa&s;ion,
<PB N="37" REF="44">
would not have been more commen|dable,
than what he did, let any one
judge.</P>
<P>If I was a Chri&s;tian, I would, for
the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> renounce this
Miracle, and not magnify and extol
it as a divine and good Act, as many
now-a-days do. I would give into,
and contend for the Truth of <HI>that
Glo&s;s,</HI> which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> of old <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Apud St. Chry&s;o&s;tomum <HI>in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> 
by way of Objection put upon it,
<HI>viz. That the Company having ex|hau&s;ted
the Bridegroom's Stock of Wine,
and being in Expectation of more</HI>;
Je&s;us, <HI>rather than the Bridegroom &s;hould
be put to the Blu&s;h for deficiency,
palm'd a fal&s;e Miracle, by the help
of the Governour of the Fea&s;t, upon
a drunken Crew</HI>; <HI>that is, having &s;ome
&s;pirituous Liquors at hand, mingled
them with a quantity of Water, which
the Governour of the Fea&s;t vouch'd
to be incomparable good Wine, mira|culou&s;ly
made by</HI> Je&s;us: <HI>and the Com|pany
being, thro' a vitiated Palate,
uncapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing better from
wor&s;e, and of di&s;covering the Fraud,
admired the Wine and the Miracle</HI>;
<HI>and applauded</HI> Je&s;us <HI>for it, and per|haps</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="45">
<HI>became his Di&s;ciples upon it.</HI> If
I, I &s;ay, was a Di&s;ciple of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I
would give this Story &s;uch an old
turn for his Credit. And I appeal
to indifferent Judges, whether &s;uch a
daubing of the Miracle, to remove the
Offence of <HI>Infidels</HI> at this Day, would
not be politically and wi&s;ely done of
me. Whether modern Chri&s;tians may
be brought into &s;uch a Notion of
this &s;uppo&s;ed Miracle, I know not;
but really there is room enough to
&s;u&s;pect &s;uch a Fraud in it.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Change of
Water into Wine to have been a real
Miracle; none commi&s;&s;ion'd of God
for the Reformation and In&s;truction
of Mankind would ever have done it
here. Miracles (as Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindication of the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> p. 82.</NOTE> 
&s;ays excellently well) <HI>mu&s;t be &s;uch
things, as that it is con&s;i&s;tent with
the Perfections of God,</HI> to intere&s;t
him&s;elf in; and again, <HI>they mu&s;t ar|gue
not only the Power of God, but
his Love to Mankind, and his Inclina|tion
to do them good</HI>; which this of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;o far from, that it has an
an evil A&s;pect and Tendency, as is
above repre&s;ented; con&s;equently it is
<PB N="39" REF="46">
to be rejected, and no longer e&s;teem'd
a divine Miracle; neither is <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to
be received as a Revealer of God's
Will for it, as Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> will
bear me witne&s;s.</P>
<P>No doubt on't, but you Chri&s;tian
Prie&s;ts would have us <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>In|fidels,</HI>
to believe the whole Com|pany
at this Wedding, for all what
is intimated by St. <HI>John</HI> to the con|trary,
to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ober and demure
Saints. I will &s;uppo&s;e &s;o; but then,
what occa&s;ion had they at all for
Wine? What rea&s;on could there be
for God's Power to interpo&s;e and make
it, e&s;pecially in &s;o large a quantity,
for them? I can conceive none. If
any of the Company had been taken
with fainting Fits; and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for
want of a Cordial Bottle, had created
a chearing Dram or two, I could not
have found fault with it; tho even
here, if he had re&s;tored the <HI>Patient</HI>
with a word of his Mouth, it had
been a better Miracle, than making
of Wine for him: But that he &s;hould
make for a Company of Sots, a large
quantity of Wine, of no le&s;s than
twelve or eighteen Firkins of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Mea&s;ure, enough to intoxicate the
whole Town of <HI>Cana</HI> of <HI>Galilee,</HI> is

A Miracle can't be too great in it&s;elf,

The Fathers of your Church fetch'd a
Rea&s;on, for the u&s;e of Water here,
from the My&s;tery; but &s;ince My&s;terys
on Miracles are &s;et a&s;ide by the Prie&s;t|hood

another and good Rea&s;on of their own;

<PB N="42" REF="49">
if for no other Rea&s;on than this,
that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> u&s;ed Water to make Wine.</P>
<P>All that I have to &s;ay more to this
Miracle, is, that it is to be wi&s;h'd, if
Je&s;us could turn Water into Wine, that
he had imparted the Secret and Power
to his Di&s;ciples of the <HI>Prie&s;thood</HI> of
all Ages &s;ince, which would have been
of greate&s;t Advantage to them in this
World. He has empower'd them, they
&s;ay, to remit Sins, which few old
Sinners think them&s;elves the le&s;s in
danger for: And he has enabled them,
&s;ome &s;ay, to tran&s;ub&s;tantiate Bread in|to
Fle&s;h, and Wine into Blood,
which none but fooli&s;h and &s;uper&s;ti|tious
Folks believe they ever did:
And he promi&s;ed to inve&s;t them with
a Power to do greater Miracles than
him&s;elf, even to remove Mountains,
and to cur&s;e Trees; but I thank God,
they never were of &s;o &s;trong a Faith,
as to put it in Practice, or we might
have heard of the <HI>natural</HI> &s;tate, as well
as we do now of the <HI>civil</HI> &s;tate of &s;ome
Countrys, ruin'd and overturn'd by
them. But this Power to tran&s;mute
<HI>Water into Wine,</HI> without Labour and
Expence, would have been of better
worth to them, than all their other
Prie&s;tly Offices. Not, that our Con|duits
<PB N="43" REF="50">
would thereupon run with Wine,
in&s;tead of Water; or that Wine would
be cheaper and more plentiful than it
is now, excepting among them&s;elves,
if they could withal cur&s;e Vineyards.
They would make the be&s;t Penny
they could of their divine Power.
And as &s;urely as they can now &s;ell
the Water-drops of their Fingers at a
Chri&s;tening, at a good Rate, they would
&s;et a better Price on their miraculou&s;ly
made Wine, and give a notable Rea|&s;on
for its dearne&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> that Miracles

<PB N="50" REF="57">
difficult to be &s;piritually expounded, is
that &s;aying of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to his Mother,
<HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine Hour is not yet come.</HI> For the clear
Interpretation of which, I own, I meet
with little in the Fathers. But St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>

as ellyptical, like an infinite num|ber
of prophetical ones, the Sen&s;e para|phra&s;tically,
and agreeably to the re&s;t of
the My&s;tery, ari&s;es thus: In an&s;wer to
the Woman of the Church's Expectation
of the Wine of the Spirit; <HI>Je&s;us</HI> will
tell her or make her to under&s;tand of
what importance it is to her (and him|&s;elf)
to be &s;upply'd with that my&s;tical
Wine to her Edification, which it was
not his time to pour forth upon the
Church, till the Celebration of his Nup|tials
with her.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the Mi|racle

expo&s;tulate with him for it, which they
hardly will any otherwi&s;e than by Ex|clamations
again&s;t him, without Rea&s;on

the Wi&s;dom and Power and Goodne&s;s of

as the Water of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets can't be turn'd into the

and Fulfiller of them. And &s;o I pa&s;s to

for whom the Roof of the Hou&s;e was

<P>And this Story (without excepting that

mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd, improbable and in|credible
of any according to the Letter.
There is not one Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;pe|cifically
related, that does not labour un|der
<PB N="52" REF="59">
more or le&s;s Ab&s;urdities, either in
Sub&s;tance or Circum&s;tance: But this, for
number and greatne&s;s of Ab&s;urdities, I
think &s;urpa&s;&s;es them all: And the Ab|&s;urdities
of it too are &s;o obvious and &s;tare
a Man in the Face, that I wonder they
are hitherto overlook'd, and that con&s;i|derate
and intelligent Per&s;ons have not
before now he&s;itated and boggled at them.
If Intere&s;t had not blinded the Eyes of
our learned <HI>Clergy,</HI> they would ea&s;ily
have de&s;cry'd the Incredibilities and Ab|&s;urdities
of this Story; and in another
<HI>Impo&s;tor</HI>'s Ca&s;e pre&s;ently have pointed
them out to the ridicule of his Admirers
and Adorers.</P>
<P>If a Man was to torture his Brains for
the Invention of a romantick Tale of im|probable
and &s;urprizing Circum&s;tances,
that he might, withal, hope to palm for
a Truth, if it was but for a Week or a
Day, upon the Faith and Under&s;tanding
of the Credulous; he could never have
pre&s;umed, I think, &s;o far upon the weak|ne&s;s
of their Intellects, as to imagine any
thing &s;o gro&s;ly and notoriou&s;ly contradic|tory
to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, would have
gone down with them, as is <HI>this</HI> before
us, which has pa&s;s'd currently thro' ma|ny
Ages of the Church, has been read
with attention by the Learned, and re|vered
<PB N="53" REF="60">
by the re&s;t of Chri&s;tians, without
any exception, he&s;itation, or doubt of
the Truth of it. In &s;hort, &s;o palpable is
the fal&s;ity of the Story of this Miracle,
that it requires no Sagacity to detect it;
and was it not for the &s;ake of the My|&s;tery
more than to expo&s;e the Folly of
the <HI>Clergy</HI> in believing of it, I had never
be&s;tow'd the following Pains on it.</P>
<P>The People, it &s;eems, &s;o pre&s;s'd and
throng'd about the Door of the Hou&s;e,
where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was, that the Paralytick and
his Bearers could not get near it. What
did they &s;o throng and pre&s;s for? Was
it to &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who was <HI>without Form
and Comeline&s;s,</HI> according to the Prophet
<HI>I&s;aiah</HI>; or, who was one of the mo&s;t
graceful of the Sons of Men, as <HI>Painters</HI>
and <HI>Publius Lentulus</HI> do de&s;cribe him?
This could not be the Rea&s;on of the
Croud. Tho a Per&s;on extraordinary, ei|ther
for Beauty or Deformity may at|tract
the Eyes of the People, and oc|ca&s;ion
too a Throng about him; yet this
could be no Rea&s;on for a <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> about
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> at <HI>Capernaum,</HI> where he dwelt,
and was commonly &s;een and well known.</P>
<P>Was it then to hear him preach?
Nor this neither. Tho an excellent
Preacher does &s;ometimes, and a very in|different
one does oftener draw multi|tudes
<PB N="54" REF="61">
after him; yet <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as a Pro|phet,
was without Honour at <HI>Capernaum,</HI>
his own Country; con&s;equently, it is
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, for his Doc|trine,
he was &s;o much follow'd here, tho
we read, that he <HI>preach'd the Word unto
them.</HI></P>
<P>Was it then to behold him working
of Miracles and curing of the di&s;ea&s;ed?
This is the likelie&s;t Rea&s;on of the Crouds
and Throng about him. And perhaps
it was a Day appointed beforehand for
his healing of the di&s;ea&s;ed, which might
occa&s;ion a more than ordinary Concour&s;e
of the People. But then this Rea&s;on
would have induced the People to make
way for the <HI>Lame, Blind,</HI> and <HI>Paraly|ticks</HI>
to come to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; or they fru&s;tra|ted
their own Hopes and Expectations of
&s;eeing Miracles wrought; and acted more
unrea&s;onably than ever Mob did, or can
be &s;uppo&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>But whatever was the Rea&s;on of this
tumultuous Crouding, which is hard to
be accounted for; it's &s;aid, the poor
<HI>Paralytick</HI> with his Bearers could not
get to the Door of the Hou&s;e for the
<HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> and therefore in all ha&s;te is he

down, thro' a breach of the Roof, into
the Room where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was. What need
<PB N="55" REF="62">
was there of &s;uch ha&s;te and pains to get
to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for a Cure? It was but wait|ing
a while, not many Hours, and in
all probability the Tumult would be ap|peas'd,
and acce&s;s ea&s;ily had to him.
But that the Bearers of the poor Man
&s;hould enterpri&s;e a trouble and difficulty
that could not require le&s;s Time, than
the Tumult could be &s;uppo&s;ed to la&s;t,
is a little &s;trange and &s;omewhat incre|dible.</P>

&s;o much as &s;ay to his Friends and Bea|rers,
"What's the Rea&s;on of this Tu|mult?
Let's &s;tay till it is appeas'd,
and the Hou&s;e clear'd of the People,

to Je&s;us." But why did he
not &s;ay &s;o? Any one be&s;ide him&s;elf and
his Bearers, if they had any Rea&s;on and
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Sen&s;es about them, would have &s;o ar|gued.
St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;ays, it was their
<HI>Faith</HI> that made them in &s;uch ha&s;te to

their <HI>Faith</HI> might have work'd <HI>Patience,</HI>
and di&s;po&s;ed them to &s;tay till Je&s;us could
come out to them, or they get in to him:
And it is an Addition to the &s;trangene&s;s
and incredibility of the Story, that it
did not.</P>

ha&s;te and danger of Life, that he could
not wait the di&s;per&s;ion of the Tumult,
but, for want of a free entrance at the
Door, is, co&s;t what it will, to be rais'd
to the top of the Hou&s;e, and a breach
mu&s;t be there made for him. The Que&s;|tion
is, whether &s;uch an Enterprize was
or could be fei&s;able and practicable? I
have no Conception of the po&s;&s;ibility of
it. If they could not get to the Door
of the Hou&s;e for the Pre&s;s; of con&s;e|quence
they could not come at the Sides
of it. How &s;hould they? over the Heads
of the People? That's not to be ima|gined;
con&s;equently here's another dif|ficulty
in the Story, that renders it yet
more &s;trange and incredible.</P>
<P>But, without que&s;tioning the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
and ea&s;ine&s;s of getting the <HI>Parly|tick</HI>
and his Couch over the Heads of
<PB N="57" REF="64">
the Mob, to the &s;ides of the Hou&s;e; thi|ther
he is brought, where we now behold
him and his Bearers with their Pullies,
Ropes, and Ladders (that were not at
hand, nor could &s;uddenly be procured)
hauling and heaving him to the top of
the Hou&s;e. Of what height the Hou&s;e
was, is not of much Con&s;equence. Some
for the Credit of the Story may &s;ay
 <NOTE N="53" PLACE="foot">Dicet aliquis valde dimi&s;&s;um fui&s;&s;e Locum, &agrave; quo per Tegulas depo&s;uerunt Paralytici Lectum. <HI>Johan. Ne|pot. Hiero&s;. in Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> , it was a <HI>very low one</HI>; tho antient
and modern <HI>Commentators</HI> are pretty well
agreed, that it was an <HI>upper-Room,</HI> where
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was; con&s;equently the Hou&s;e was
at lea&s;t two Stories high: But if it was
much higher, I'll allow that Art and
Pullies (which they wanted for the pre|&s;ent)
would rai&s;e the Man and his Bed
to the top of it: So we will not di&s;|pute
nor differ upon that matter. On
the top of the Hou&s;e then, we are now
to behold the <HI>Paralytick</HI> and his Bearers
with their Hatchets and Hammers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
(which they forgot to bring with them,
for they could not think of any u&s;e
they &s;hould have of them) uncovering
the Roof of the Hou&s;e; breaking up
<HI>Tiles, Spars,</HI> and <HI>Rafters,</HI> and making a
Hole, capacious enough for the Man and
<PB N="58" REF="65">
his Bed to be let through. An odd, &s;trange,
and unaccountable Work <HI>this,</HI> which, if
they had not been cunning Fellows, would
hardly have enter'd into their Heads to
project. But at work they are, when it
was well, if Je&s;us and his Di&s;ciples e|&s;caped
with a only broken Pate, by the fal|ling
of Tiles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if the re&s;t were
not almo&s;t &s;mother'd with the Du&s;t; for
it was over their Heads that the breach
was made. Where was the good Man of
the Hou&s;e all this while? Would he
&s;uffer his Hou&s;e to be thus broken up,
and not command them to de&s;i&s;t from
their fooli&s;h and needle&s;s Attempt, till
the Mob was quell'd, and there was a free
entrance at the Door of his Hou&s;e, which
could not be long fir&s;t? Is there nothing
in all this, of difficulty and ob&s;truction
in the way of the belief of this Story?</P>
<P>Some modern <HI>Commentators,</HI> being a|ware
of the&s;e difficulties in this Story,
and willing to reconcile Men to the ea|&s;ier
belief of it, &s;ay, as <HI>Dru&s;ius</HI> <NOTE N="54" PLACE="foot">Judaeorum Tecta plana erant, &amp; non in Coni formam fa&s;tigiata. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> did,
that the Hou&s;es of <HI>Judaea</HI> were <HI>flat|roof'd,</HI>
<HI>and not ridg'd</HI>: And Doctors,
<HI>Lightfoot</HI> and <HI>Whitby</HI> <NOTE N="55" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> &s;ay, there was
<PB N="59" REF="66">
a Door on their flat Roofs, by which the
<HI>Jews</HI> u&s;ed to a&s;cend to the top of their
Hou&s;es, where they di&s;cours'd on the
Law and religious Matters; and that it
was thro' &s;uch a Door, by a little wide|ning
of the &s;ides of it, that the <HI>Para|lytick</HI>
was let down in the pre&s;ence of
<HI>Je&s;us.</HI> To which Opinion I would yield,
if it was not liable to the&s;e Objections,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it is not reconcilable to what
St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, of <HI>their letting the Para|lytick
down thro' the Tiling with his
Couch, in the mid&s;t, where Je&s;us was</HI>;
nor hardly con&s;i&s;tent with what St. <HI>Mark</HI>
&s;ays, of their <HI>uncovering</HI> and <HI>breaking
up the Roof of the Hou&s;e:</HI> which Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> had never u&s;ed,
if there had been a Door for him to de|&s;cend
by. But to indulge <HI>Lightfoot</HI> and
<HI>Whitby</HI> in their Notion; I may ask them,
what occa&s;ion was there then of wide|ning
the door-way, and breaking down
the &s;ides of it? They'll &s;ay, becau&s;e the
Pa&s;&s;age otherwi&s;e was too narrow, for the
Man's Couch to get thro'. Why then
did not they take him out of his Couch,
and let him down in a Blanket, a Chair,
or a Basket? Or rather, why did not
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to prevent this Trouble and Damage
to the Hou&s;e, a&s;cend thro' this Door, to
the Top of it, and there &s;peak the healing
<PB N="60" REF="67">
Word to this poor Man? To &s;ay, that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> could not or would not go up to
the Paralytick, I would not, for Fear of
an Imputation of Bla&s;phemy again&s;t me.
Our <HI>Divines</HI> therefore are to look for,
what they'll hardly find, an An&s;wer to
the &s;aid Que&s;tion, which will con&s;i&s;t with
the Wi&s;dom, the Goodne&s;s and Honour of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>; or here will be another and in|&s;uperable
Bar to the Credibility of this
Story.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there are more and greater Dif|ficultys
affecting the Credit of this Mira|cle,
on the &s;ide of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than any before
urg'd. Could not he, as it was antiently
 <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Numquid enim facilem illi potuit Acce&s;&s;um red|dere? <HI>Apud Chry&s;o&s;tom. de hoc Paralyt.</HI></NOTE> objected, have made the Acce&s;s to
him&s;elf more ea&s;y? Could not he, to pre|vent
all this Trouble and Pains of getting
to the Top of the Hou&s;e; and of breaking
up the Roof of it, have de&s;ired or even
forc'd the People to make way for this
poor Man and his Bearers? This was not
impo&s;&s;ible for him to do. If it was hard
for another; it was not for him, who was
omnipotent. He that could drive his
Thou&s;ands before him out of the Temple;
and draw as many after him into the Wil|derne&s;s,
might &s;urely, by Force or Per|&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="61" REF="68">
have made the People, how unrea|tonably
mobbi&s;h &s;oever, to retreat. And
&s;hy did he not? Without a good and &s;a|tisfactory
An&s;wer, which I can't conceive,
to this Que&s;tion, here is the mo&s;t unac|countable
and incredible part of the whole
Story, that reflects on the Wi&s;dom, the
Power and Goodne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> If there
had been no other ab&s;urd Circum&s;tances of
it, this is enough to &s;poil its Credit, &s;o
far as that I believe it impo&s;&s;ible for
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI> with all their
Wit, Penetration and Sagacity to get o|ver
it.</P>
<P>Believe then the Story of this Miracle,
thus taken to Pieces, who can? It is &s;uch
an Accumulation of Ab&s;urdities, Improba|bilities,
and Incredibilities, that a Man of
the mo&s;t ea&s;y Faith, if he at all think,
can't dige&s;t. It's not credible, I &s;aid, to
&s;uppo&s;e, the People of <HI>Capernaum,</HI> where
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> dwelt, and was well known and
little admired, would at all <HI>pre&s;s</HI> to &s;ee
or hear him: And if the occa&s;ion of their
Concour&s;e was to behold his Miracles;
it is le&s;s rea&s;onable to think they would
tumultuate to their own di&s;appointment;
but rather make way for the di&s;ea&s;ed, for
the &s;atisfaction of their own Curio&s;ity, to
come to him: And if they did mob it
to their own di&s;appointment, about the
<PB N="62" REF="69">
Door of the Hou&s;e; it was next to im|po&s;&s;ible
for the poor Man and his Couch
to be heav'd over their Heads, and rais'd
to the top of it: More unrea&s;onable yet
to think, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e would
&s;uffer the Roof of it to be &s;o broken up:
But mo&s;t of all again&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e,
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> would not give forth the heal|ing
word, and prevent all this Labour,
or by his divine Power di&s;per&s;e the Peo|ple,
that the <HI>Paralytick</HI> might have pre&s;ent
and ea&s;y acce&s;s to him.</P>
<P>Whether all this be not ab&s;olutely
&s;hocking of the Credit of this Story, let
my Readers judge. In my Opinion, no
Tale more mon&s;trou&s;ly romantick can be
told. I don't here que&s;tion <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Power
to heal this Paralytick, nor the miracu|lou&s;ne&s;s
of the Cure of him: The trou|ble
of that Que&s;tion is &s;aved me, by
the many other incredible Circum&s;tances
of the Story, which are &s;uch a Contra|diction
to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, as is not to
be equall'd, in any thing, that's com|monly
receiv'd and believ'd by Mankind.
<HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, that there is nothing &s;o ab|&s;urd,
which &s;ome of the Philo&s;ophers have
not held. And they might and did, &s;ome
of them, hold gro&s;s Ab&s;urdities. But the
Letter of the Story of this Miracle be|fore
us, which is the Object of the Faith
<PB N="63" REF="70">
of our learned Prie&s;thood at this Day, a is
match for the wor&s;t of them.</P>
<P>But as ab&s;urd, as this Story is, I ex|pect
that our <HI>Clergy</HI> will be di&s;gu&s;ted at
my ludicrous di&s;play of it; and that
Arch-Deacon <HI>Stubbs</HI> in particular will a|gain
be ready to exclaim again&s;t me, and
&s;ay, that this is turning a <HI>miraculous
Fact,</HI> and a <HI>divine Te&s;timony</HI> of our Re|ligion
into Ridicule. Whereupon it is
to be wi&s;h'd, <HI>that Arch-Deacon</HI> would
write, what would be a Plea&s;ure to &s;ee,
a Vindication of this Story. If he can
account for the po&s;&s;ibility and credibi|lity
of the Letter of it, he &s;hall have
my leave to make another dull Speech
in <HI>Convocation</HI> again&s;t me. And it is not
unlikely, but he may &s;ay as much for
it, as another Man: For as the Story is
&s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;o it is the better &s;uited to his
Head and Brains. But if he don't, I
much que&s;tion, whether any other Cler|gyman
of more Wit will, appear in De|fence
of it.</P>
<P>So ab&s;urd is the Letter of this Story,
that for the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and Cre|dibility
of his Go&s;pel, it is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to turn it into Allegory. To the
Fathers then, let us go for their help in
this Ca&s;e. If they did not read me a better
Lecture upon this Miracle, than do our
<PB N="64" REF="71">
modern <HI>Commentators,</HI> I &s;hould be almo&s;t
tempted to renounce my Religion upon
it: But as they have rationally and
rightly in&s;tructed me in its true meaning,
&s;o I retain my Chri&s;tian Faith, and ad|mire
the Sublimity of the My&s;tery, which
I am now to give an account of.</P>

<P>But to the top of the Hou&s;e is Mankind,

of Man's &s;piritual Pal&s;y, the un&s;teadi|ne&s;s
and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of his Morals and
Principles.</P>
<P>So much, in &s;hort, then to the my&s;tical
Interpretation of the Story of this Mi|racle.
The literal Sen&s;e of it is &s;o en|cumber'd
with romantick Circum&s;tances,
as are enough to turn a Man's Heart
again&s;t Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf: But in the
My&s;tery there will be a mo&s;t &s;tupendous
Miracle, which will be not only an Ar|gument
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s divine Power, but of
his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip,</HI> as certainly as his Hou&s;e
of Wi&s;dom, of which the Scriptures
write, is open'd to the Manife&s;tation of
his Pre&s;ence, and to the Cure of Man|kind
of his paralytical Di&s;ea&s;e, call'd an
in&s;tability of Faith and Principles.</P>
<P>And thus have I, in this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI>
taken into Examination three more of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles; which I &s;ubmit to the
Judgment of my Readers, whether the
literal Story of them does not con&s;i&s;t of
Ab&s;urdities, Improbabilities and Incredi|bilites
according to the Propo&s;ition be|fore
us; and whether there is not a
nece&s;&s;ity, for the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to
<PB N="68" REF="75">
turn them into prophetical and parabo|lical
Narratives of what will be my&s;te|riou&s;ly
and more wonderfully done by
him.</P>
<P>My next <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> if my mind hold,
&s;hall treat on the three Stories of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
rai&s;ing of the dead, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Widow
of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; after which I will give the
literal Hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,
that &s;andy Foundation of the Church, a
Review; and &s;o conclude my Di&s;cour&s;es
on the Miracles of our Saviour.</P>
<P>To run thro' all the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
and handle them in the manner I have
done the foregoing, would be a long and
tedious Work. But if our <HI>Divines</HI> &s;hall
think, I have &s;elected only tho&s;e Mira|cles,
which are obnoxious to Cavil and
Ridicule; and have omitted others, that
literally are a more unexceptionable
Te&s;timony of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s divine Power, and
Authority; I will, for their Satisfaction,
take more of them to Task, and give
the Letter of their Stories, the like ludi|crous
treatment. If I mi&s;take not, the
Miracles already &s;poken to, together with
tho&s;e of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s rai&s;ing of the dead, and
of his own Re&s;urrection, are the mo&s;t
famous and remarkable of any others:
And according to the Ob&s;ervation I have
<PB N="69" REF="76">
made on the re&s;t, they are no le&s;s but ra|ther
more liable to Ridicule and Excep|tion.
But if any are of a contrary Opi|nion,
and will let me know, which in
their Judgment are more unexceptio|nable
Miracles, I will vouch&s;afe them
an Examination. I am &s;ure there is not
one Miracle, which the Fathers of the
Church did not turn into Allegory; and
if we don't at this Day make my&s;tical
Operations of them, they will none of
them, according to the Letter, &s;tand their
Ground, nor abide the Te&s;t of a critical
Inquiry into them.</P>
<P>I don't expect, that this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> will
be any more plea&s;ing and acceptable to
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>Let|ter</HI>
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles, as well as of the
Prophecies of him, than any of my for|mer:
But their Di&s;plea&s;ure in the Ca&s;e
will give me no Di&s;turbance, nor am I
concern'd about any Re&s;entment, they
can make of it. If they are offended at
the&s;e <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> they &s;hould as they came
forth, have written &s;olid Confutations
of them, and &s;o have prevented my Pub|lication
of any more of this kind: But
in&s;tead of &s;erious and potent Rea&s;onings
again&s;t me, I have met with little el&s;e
but oral Railings, Exclamations, Defa|mations,
and attempts for Pro&s;ecution;
<PB N="70" REF="77">
which have been &s;o far from terrifying
me, that they give me a &s;ecret Plea|&s;ure,
and animate me to proceed in the
Undertaking in hand.</P>
<P>I did not much que&s;tion but the <HI>Bi|&s;hop</HI>
of St. <HI>Davids,</HI> whom I look'd up|on
as a Per&s;on of Ingenuity and Learning
would, before this Time, have publi&s;h'd
&s;omewhat in Confutation of one or other
of my former <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es.</HI> Whether he
was not obliged to it, or to make me
&s;ome publick Reparation of the Injury
done to my Reputation, by his &s;lande|rous
Sermon, I appeal now to the wor|&s;hipful
<HI>Societys</HI> for Reformation of Man|ners;
to whom, and to other Civil Ma|gi&s;trates,
I hope his Sermon, without
Rea&s;on, will be a Caution, that no Pulpit-Invective
move them to pro&s;ecute or
think the wor&s;e of any Author.</P>
<P>Liberty of thinking, writing and judg|ing
for our &s;elves in Religion is a natural,
a Chri&s;tian, and a prote&s;tant <HI>Right.</HI> It is
a <HI>Right</HI> that the Magi&s;trate as well as the
Subject are intere&s;ted in, and are to &s;ee
to the Con&s;ervation of, or their Under-&s;tandings
as well as their Pur&s;es will be
ridden and oppre&s;s'd by an ignorant and
tyrannical Prie&s;thood. I urge not this
for my own &s;ecurity again&s;t Pro&s;ecution
for Infidelity and Bla&s;phemy, declaring
<PB N="71" REF="78">
that if the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> St. <HI>Da|vids,</HI>
or <HI>Arch-Deacon Stubbs,</HI> who are
zealous for Per&s;ecution, will but engage
me on the Stage of Controver&s;y, and
make good their Accu&s;ations again&s;t me,
I will &s;ubmit to the wor&s;t Puni&s;hment,
that can be inflicted on the wor&s;t Offen|der.</P>
<P>In the mean time I will go on with
my Undertaking, to the advancement of
Truth, and demon&s;tration of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah|&s;hip</HI>
of the Holy <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to whom be
Glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
