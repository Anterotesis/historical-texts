<HEAD>MEMOIRS of the AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE enthu&s;ia&s;m of poetry, like that of reli|gion,
has frequently a powerful influence on
the conduct of life, and either throws it into the
retreat of uniform ob&s;curity, or marks it with irre|gularities
that lead to mi&s;ery and di&s;quiet. The
gifts of imagination bring the heavie&s;t ta&s;k upon
the vigilance of rea&s;on; and to bear tho&s;e faculties
with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmne&s;s and of cool attention
which doth not always attend the higher gifts of
the mind. Yet, difficult as nature her&s;elf &s;eems to
have rendered the ta&s;k of regularity to genius, it is
the &s;upreme con&s;olation of <HI>dulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>folly,</HI> to point
with gothic triumph to the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, which are
the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed.
Perfectly uncon&s;cious that they are indebted to their
&s;tupidity for the con&s;i&s;tency of their conduct, they
plume them&s;elves on an imaginary virtue, which
has its origin in what is really their di&s;grace.&mdash;Let
&s;uch, if &s;uch dare approach the &s;hrine of COLLINS,
withdraw to a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, and, &s;hould they
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
behold the ruins of genius, or the weakne&s;s of an
exalted mind, let them be taught to lament that
nature has left the noble&s;t of their works imper|fect.</P>
<P>OF &s;uch men of genius as have borne no public
character, it &s;eldom happens that any memoirs can
be collected, of con&s;equence enough to be record|ed
by the biographer. If their lives pa&s;s in ob&s;cu|rity,
they are generally too uniform to engage our
attention; if they cultivate and obtain popularity,
envy and malignity will mingle their poi&s;on with
the draughts of prai&s;e; and through the indu&s;try
of tho&s;e unwearied fiends, their reputation will be
&s;o chequered, and their characters &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, that
it &s;hall become difficult for the hi&s;torian to &s;eparate
truth from fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>OF our exalted poet, who&s;e life, though far
from being popular, did not altogether pa&s;s in pri|vacy,
we meet with few other accounts than &s;uch
as the life of every man will afford, <HI>viz.</HI> when he
was born, where he was educated, and where he
died. Yet even the&s;e &s;imple memoirs of the man
will not be unacceptable to tho&s;e who admire the
poet: for we never receive plea&s;ure without a de|&s;ire
to be acquainted with the &s;ource from whence
it &s;prings; a &s;pecies of curio&s;ity, which, as it &s;eems
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
to be in&s;tinctive, was, probably, given us for the
noble end of gratitude; and, finally, to elevate the
enquiries of the mind to that fountain of perfection
from which all human excellence is derived.</P>
<P>CHICHESTER, a city in Su&s;&s;ex, had the honour
of giving birth to the author of the following po|ems,
about the year 1721. His father, who was
a reputable trade&s;man in that city, intended him
for the &s;ervice of the church; and with this view,
in the year 1733, he was admitted a &s;cholar of that
illu&s;trious &s;eminary of genius and learning, Win|che&s;ter
college, where &s;o many di&s;tingui&s;hed men
of letters, &s;o many excellent poets have received
their cla&s;&s;ical education. Here he had the good
fortune to continue &s;even years under the care of
the very learned Dr. Burton; and at the age of
nineteen, in the year 1740, he had merit &s;ufficient
to procure a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in the li&s;t of tho&s;e
&s;cholars, who are elected, upon the foundation of
Winche&s;ter, to New College in Oxford. But as
there were then no vacancies in that &s;ociety, he
was admitted a commoner of Queen's College in
the &s;ame univer&s;ity; where he continued till July
1741, when he was elected a demy of Magdalen
College. During his re&s;idence at Queen's, he was
at once di&s;tingui&s;hed for genius and indolence; his
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
exerci&s;es, when he could be prevailed upon to
write, bearing the vi&s;ible characteri&s;tics of both.
This remi&s;s and inattentive habit might probably
ari&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from di&s;appointment: he
had, no doubt, indulged very high ideas of the a|cademical
mode of education, and when he found
&s;cience within the fetters of logic and of Ari&s;totle,
it was no wonder if he abated of his diligence to
&s;cek her where the &s;earch was attended with artifi|cial
perplexities, and where, at la&s;t, the pur&s;uer
would gra&s;p the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>WHILE he was at Magdalen College, he applied
him&s;elf chiefly to the cultivation of poetry, and
wrote the epi&s;tle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and the
Oriental Eclogues, which, in the year 1742, were
publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>Per&s;ian Eclogues.</HI>&mdash;The
&s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e poems was far from being equal to
their merit; but to a novice in the pur&s;uit of fame,
the lea&s;t encouragement is &s;ufficient: if he does
not at once acquire that reputation to which his
merit intitles him, he embraces the encomiums of
the few, forgives the many, and intends to open
their eyes to the &s;triking beauties of his next Pub|lication.</P>
<P>WITH pro&s;pects &s;uch as the&s;e, probably, Mr.
Collins indulged his fancy, when, in the year 1743,
<PB N="v" REF="8">
after having taken the degree of a batchelor of arts,
he left the univer&s;ity, and removed to London.</P>
<P>To a man of &s;mall fortune, a liberal &s;pirit, and
uncertain dependencies, the metropolis is a very
dangerous place. Mr. Collins had not been long in
town before he became an in&s;tance of the truth of
this ob&s;ervation. His pecuniary re&s;ources were ex|hau&s;ted,
and to re&s;tore them by the exertion of ge|nius
and learning, though he wanted not the pow|er,
he had neither &s;teadine&s;s nor indu&s;try. His ne|ce&s;&s;ities,
indeed, &s;ometimes carried him as far as a
&s;cheme, or a title page for a book; but, whether
it were the power of di&s;&s;ipation, or the genius of
repo&s;e that interfered, he could proceed no farther.
Several books were projected, which he was very able
to execute; and he became, in idea, an hi&s;torian,
a critic, and a dramatic poet by turns. At one time he
determined to write an hi&s;tory of the revival of Let|ters;
at another to tran&s;late and comment upon
Ari&s;totle's Poetics; then he turned his thoughts to
the Drama, and proceeded &s;o far towards a trage|dy&mdash;as
to become acquainted with the manager.</P>
<P>UNDER this unaccountable di&s;&s;ipation, he &s;uf|fered
the greate&s;t inconveniencies. Day &s;ucceeded
day, for the &s;upport of which he had made no pro|vi&s;ion,
and in which he was to &s;ub&s;i&s;t either by the
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
long-repeated contributions of a friend, or the ge|nero&s;ity
of a ca&s;ual acquaintance.&mdash;Yet indolence
triumphed at once over want and &s;hame; and nei|ther
the anxieties of poverty, nor the heart-burning
of dependance had power to animate re&s;olution to
per&s;everance.</P>
<P>As there is a degree of depravity into which if a
man falls, he becomes incapable of attending to any
of the ordinary means that recall men to virtue, &s;o
there are &s;ome circum&s;tances of indigence &s;o ex|tremely
degrading, that they de&s;troy the influences
of &s;hame it&s;elf; and mo&s;t &s;pirits are apt to &s;ink,
under their oppre&s;&s;ion, into a &s;ullen and unambiti|ous
de&s;pondence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this might be with regard to Mr.
Collins, we find that, in the year 1746, he had
&s;pirit and re&s;olution enough to publi&s;h his <HI>Odes de|&s;criptive
and allegorical.</HI> Mr. MILLAR, a book|&s;eller
in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and a favourer of genius,
<HI>when once it has made its way to &s;ame,</HI> publi&s;hed
them ON THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT.&mdash;He hap|pened,
indeed, to be in the right not to publi&s;h
them on his own; for the &s;ale was by no means
&s;ucce&s;sful: and hence it was that the author, con|ceiving
a ju&s;t indignation again&s;t a blind and ta&s;te|le&s;s
age, burnt the remaining copies with his own
hands.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="10">
ALLEGORICAL and ab&s;tracted poetry was above
the ta&s;te of tho&s;e times, as much, or more than it
is of the pre&s;ent. It is in the lower walks, the
plain and practical paths of the mu&s;es only that the
generality of men can be entertained. The higher
efforts of imagination are above their capacity;
and it is no wonder therefore, if the Odes de&s;crip|tive
and allegorical met with few admirers.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;o mortifying to e|very
ju&s;t expectation, when neither his wants were
relieved, nor his reputation extended, he found
&s;ome con&s;olation in changing the &s;cene, and vi&s;it|ing
his uncle, colonel MARTIN, who was, at that
time, with our army in Flanders. Soon after his
arrival, the colonel died, and left him a con&s;iderable
fortune.</P>
<P>HERE, then, we &s;hould hope to behold him
happy; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of independence, and removed
from every &s;cene, and every monument of his former
mi&s;ery. But, fortune had delayed her favours till
they were not worth receiving. His faculties had
been &s;o long harra&s;&s;ed by anxiety, di&s;&s;ipation, and
di&s;tre&s;s, that he fell into a nervous di&s;order, which
brought with it an unconquerable depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pi|rits,
and at length reduced the fine&s;t under&s;tanding
to the mo&s;t deplorable childi&s;hne&s;s. In the fir&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="11">
&s;tages of his di&s;order he attempted to relieve him|&s;elf
by travel, and pa&s;&s;ed into France; but the grow|ing
malady obliged him to return; and having con|tinued,
with &s;hort intervals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems to have been in one of the&s;e intervals, that he was vi&s;ited by an ingenious friend, who tells us he found him with a book in his hand, and being a&s;ked what it was, he an|&s;wered, that "he had but one book, but that was the be&s;t." It was the New-Te&s;tament in Engli&s;h.</NOTE> in this pitiable &s;tate
till the year 1756, he died in the arms of a &s;i&s;ter at
Chiche&s;ter.</P>
<P>MR. Collins was, in &s;tature, &s;omewhat above the
middle &s;ize; of a brown complexion, keen, ex|pre&s;&s;ive
eyes, and a &s;ixed, &s;edate a&s;pect, which, from
inten&s;e thinking, had contracted an habitual frown.
His pro&s;iciency in letters was greater than could
have been expected from his years. He was &s;killed
in the learned languages, and acquainted with the
<HI>Italian, French,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI>&mdash;It is ob&s;ervable that
none of his poems bear the marks of an amorous
di&s;po&s;ition, and that he is one of tho&s;e few poets, who
have &s;ailed to Delphi, without touching at Cythera.
The allu&s;ions of this kind that appear in his Orien|tal
Eclogues were indi&s;pen&s;able in that &s;pecies of
poetry; and it is very remarkable that in his <HI>Pa&s;&s;i|ons,</HI>
an ode for mu&s;ic, love is omitted, though it
&s;hould have made a principal figure there.</P>

<P>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<PB N="79" REF="78">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, etc.</HEAD>
<P>THE genius of the pa&s;toral, as well as of every
other re&s;pectable &s;pecies of poetry, had its ori|gin
in the Ea&s;t, and from thence was tran&s;planted by
the Mu&s;es of Greece; but whether from the continent
of the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, or from Egypt, which, about the
aera of the Grecian pa&s;toral, was the ho&s;pitable nur&s;e
of letters, it is not ea&s;y to determine. From the &s;ub|jects
and the manner of Theocritus, one would incline
to the latter opinion, while the hi&s;tory of Bion is in
&s;avour of the former.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though it &s;hould &s;till remain a doubt
through what channel the pa&s;toral travelled we&s;tward,
there is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of uncertainty concerning
its Oriental origin.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ages, which, guided by &s;acred chronolo|gy,
from a comparative view of time, we call the
early ages, it appears from the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;to|rians,
that the chie&s;s of the people employed them&s;elves
in rural exerci&s;es, and that a&s;tronomers and legi&s;la|tors
were at the &s;ame time &s;hepherds. Thus Strabo
informs us that the hi&s;tory of the creation was com|municated
to the Egyptians by a Chaldean &s;hepherd.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79">
FROM the&s;e circum&s;tances it is evident not only
that &s;uch &s;hepherds were capable of all the dignity
and elegance peculiar to poetry, but that whatever
poetry they attempted would be of the pa&s;toral kind;
would take its &s;ubjects from tho&s;e &s;cenes of rural &s;im|plicity
in which they were conver&s;ant, and, as it was
the offspring of Harmony and Nature, would employ
the powers it derived from the former to celebrate the
beauty and benevolence of the latter.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find that the mo&s;t ancient po|ems
treat of agriculture, a&s;tronomy, and other objects
within the rural and natural &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>WHAT con&s;titutes the difference between the Geor|gic
and the Pa&s;toral is love, and the colloquial, or dra|matic
form of compo&s;ition peculiar to the latter: this
form of compo&s;ition is &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ed with,
and love and rural imagery alone are thought &s;uffici|ent
to di&s;tingui&s;h the pa&s;toral. The tender pa&s;&s;ion,
however, &s;eems to be e&s;&s;ential to this &s;pecies of poetry,
and is hardly ever excluded from tho&s;e pieces that
were intended to come under this denomination: e|ven
in tho&s;e eclogues of the Amoebean kind, who&s;e only
purport is a trial of &s;kill between contending &s;hep|herds,
love has its u&s;ual &s;hare, and the prai&s;es of
their re&s;pective mi&s;te&s;&s;es are the general &s;ubjects of the
competitors.</P>
<P>IT is to be lamented that &s;carce any oriental com|po&s;itions
of this kind have &s;urvived the ravages of ig|norance,
<PB N="81" REF="80">
tyranny and time; we cannot doubt that
many &s;uch have been extant, po&s;&s;ibly as far down as
that fatal period, never to be mentioned in the world
of letters without horrour, when the glorious monu|ments
of human ingenuity peri&s;hed in the a&s;hes of the
Alexandrian library.</P>
<P>THOSE ingenious Creeks whom we call the parents
of pa&s;toral poetry were, probably, no more than imi|tators
of imitators, that derived their harmony from
higher and remoter &s;ources, and kindled their poeti|cal
fires at tho&s;e unextingui&s;hed lamps which burned
within the tombs of oriental genius.</P>
<P>IT is evident that Homer has availed him&s;elf of
tho&s;e magnificent images and de&s;criptions &s;o fre|quently
to be met with in the books of the Old Te&s;ta|ment;
and why may not Theocritus, Mo&s;chus and
Bion have found their archetypes in other ea&s;tern wri|ters,
who&s;e names have peri&s;hed with their works?
yet, though it may not be illiberal to admit &s;uch a
&s;uppo&s;ition, it would, certainly, be invidious to con|clued
what the malignity of cavillers alone could &s;ug|ge&s;t
with regard to Homer, that they de&s;troyed the
&s;ources from which they borrowed, and, as it is fa|bled
of the young of the pelican, drained their &s;up|porters
to death.</P>
<P>As the &s;eptuagint-tran&s;lation of the Old Te&s;tament
was performed at the reque&s;t, and under the patro|nage
<PB N="82" REF="81">
of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it were not to be won|dered
if Theocritus, who was entertained at that
prince's court, had borrowed &s;ome part of his pa&s;to|ral
imagery from the poetical pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e books.&mdash;I
think it can hardly be doubted that the Sicilian
poet had in his eye certain expre&s;&s;ions of the prophet
I&s;aiah, when he wrote the following lines.</P>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Let vexing brambles the blue violet bear,</L>
<L>On the rude thorn Narci&s;&s;us dre&s;s his hair&mdash;</L>
<L>All, all revers'd&mdash;The pine with pears be crown'd,</L>
<L>And the bold deer &s;hall drag the trembling hound.</L></Q>
<P>The cau&s;e, indeed, of the&s;e phenomena is very diffe|rent
in the Greek from what it is in the Hebrew po|et;
the former employing them on the death, the
latter on the birth of an important per&s;on: but the
marks of imitation are neverthele&s;s obvious.</P>
<P>IT might, however, be expected that if Theocri|tus
had borrowed at all from the &s;acred writers, the
celebrated pa&s;toral Epithalamium of Solomon, &s;o
much within his own walk of Poetry, would not cer|tainly
have e&s;caped his notice. His Epithalamium on
the marriage of Helena, moreover, gave him an o|pen
<PB N="83" REF="82">
field for imitation; therefore, if he has any ob|ligations
to the royal bard, we may expect to find
them there. The very opening of the poem is in the
&s;pirit of the Hebrew &s;ong:
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">.</Q>
The colour of imitation is &s;till &s;tronger in the follow|ing
pa&s;&s;age:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign">,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L></Q>
This de&s;cription of Helen is infinitely above the &s;tyle
and figure of the Sicilian pa&s;toral&mdash;"She is like the
ri&s;ing of the golden morning, when the night de|parteth,
and when the winter is over and gone.
She re&s;embleth the cypre&s;s in the garden, the
hor&s;e in the chariots of The&s;&s;aly." The&s;e figures
plainly declare their origin, and others equally imi|tative
might be pointed out in the &s;ame idyllium.</P>
<P>THIS beautiful and luxuriant marriage-pa&s;toral of
Solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental ec|logue
that has &s;urvived the ruins of time; a happine&s;s
for which it is, probably, more indebted to its &s;acred
<PB N="84" REF="83">
character than to its intrin&s;ic merit. Not that it is by
any means de&s;titute of poetical excellence: like all the
ea&s;tern poetry, it is bold, wild and unconnected in
its figures, allu&s;ions and parts, and has all that grace|ful
and magnificent daring which characteri&s;es its
metaphorical and comparative imagery.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e peculiarities, &s;o ill adapted
to the frigid genius of the north, Mr. COLLINS could
make but little u&s;e of it as a precedent for his oriental
eclogues; and even in his third eclogue, where the
&s;ubject is of a &s;imilar nature, he has cho&s;en rather to
follow the mode of the Doric and the Latian pa&s;toral.</P>
<P>THE &s;cenery and &s;ubjects then of the following ec|logues
alone are Oriental; the &s;tyle and colouring are
purely European; and, for this rea&s;on, the author's
preface, in which he intimates that he had the origi|nals
from a merchant who traded to the Ea&s;t, is o|mitted
as being now altogether &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the merit of the&s;e eclogues, it
may ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;erted, that in &s;implicity of de&s;cripti|on
and expre&s;&s;ion, in delicacy and &s;oftne&s;s of num|bers,
and in natural and unaffected tenderne&s;s, they
are not to be equalled by any thing of the pa&s;toral
kind in the Engli&s;h language.</P>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eclogue, which is entitled Selim, or the
Shepherd's Moral, as there is nothing drama|tic
in the &s;ubject, may be thought the lea&s;t entertain|ing
of the four: but it is, by no means, the lea&s;t va|luable.
The moral precepts which the intelligent
&s;hepherd delivers to his fellow-&s;wains and virgins,
their companions, are &s;uch as would infallibly pro|mote
the happine&s;s of the pa&s;toral life.</P>
<P>IN imper&s;onating the private <HI>virtues,</HI> the poet has
ob&s;erved great propriety, and has formed their ge|nealogy
with the mo&s;t perfect judgment, when he re|pre&s;ents
them as the daughters of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>THE characteri&s;tics of <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> are ex|tremely

The two <HI>&s;imiles</HI> borrowed from rural objects are not

<P>IT cannot be objected to this eclogue that it wants
both the&s;e e&s;&s;ential <HI>criteria</HI> of the pa&s;toral, love and
the drama; for though it partakes not of the latter,
the former &s;till retains an intere&s;t in it, and that too
very material, as it profe&s;&s;edly con&s;ults the virtue and
happine&s;s of the lover, while it informs what are the
qualities
&mdash;that mu&s;t lead to love.</P>

<P>ALL the advantages that any &s;pecies of poetry
can derive from the novelty of the &s;ubject and
&s;cenery, this eclogue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. The rout of a camel|driver
is a &s;cene that &s;carce could exi&s;t in the imagi|nation
of an European, and of its attendant di&s;tre&s;&s;es
he could have no idea.&mdash;The&s;e are very happily and
minutely painted by our de&s;criptive poet. What &s;ub|lime
&s;impliciry of expre&s;&s;ion! what nervous plainne&s;s
in the opening of the poem!
<Q><L>In &s;ilent horror o'er the boundle&s;s wa&s;te</L>
<L>The driver Ha&s;&s;an with the camels pa&s;t.</L></Q>
The magic pencil of the poet brings the whole &s;cene
before us at once, as it were by enchantment, and in
this &s;ingle couplet we feel all the effect that ari&s;es from
the terrible wildne&s;s of a region unenlivened by the
habitations of men. The ver&s;es that de&s;cribe &s;o mi|nutely
the camel-driver's little provi&s;ions, have a touch|ing
influence on the imagination, and prepare to en|ter
more feelingly into his future apprehensions of
di&s;tre&s;s:
<Q><PB N="88" REF="87">
<L>Bethink thee Ha&s;&s;an, where &s;hall thir&s;t a&s;&s;uage,</L>
<L>When fails this crui&s;e, his unrelenting rage!</L></Q>
It is difficult to &s;ay whether his apo&s;trophe to, the
"mute companions of his toils" is more to be
admired for the elegance and beauty of the poetical
imagery, or for the tenderne&s;s and humanity of the
&s;entiment. He who can read it without being affect|ed,
will do his heart no inju&s;tice, if he concludes it to
be de&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility:
<Q><L>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</L>
<L>In all my grie&s;s a more than equal &s;hare!</L>
<L>Here, where no &s;prings in murmur break away,</L>
<L>Or mo&s;s-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</L>
<L>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</L>
<L>Which plains more ble&s;t, or verdant vales be&s;tow:</L>
<L>Here rocks alone, and ta&s;tele&s;s &s;ands are found,</L>
<L>And faint and &s;ickly winds for ever howl around.</L></Q>
Yet in the&s;e beautiful lines there is a flight error,
which writers of the greate&s;t genius very frequently
fall into.&mdash;It will be needle&s;s to ob&s;erve to the accurate
reader that in the fifth and &s;ixth ver&s;es there is a ver|bal
pleona&s;m, where the poet &s;peaks of the <HI>green</HI> de|lights
of <HI>verdant</HI> vales. There is an over&s;ight of
<PB N="89" REF="88">
the &s;ame kind, in the Manners, an Ode; where the
poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;Seine's <HI>blue</HI> nymphs deplore,</L>
<L>In <HI>watchet</HI> weeds&mdash;</L></Q>
This fault is indeed a common one, but to a reader
of ta&s;te it is neverthele&s;s di&s;gu&s;tful; and it is menti|oned
here as the error of a man of genius and judg|ment,
that men of genius and judgment may guard
again&s;t it.</P>
<P>MR. COLLINS &s;peaks like a true Poet as well in &s;en|timent
as expre&s;&s;ion, when, with regard to the thir&s;t
of wealth, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Why heed we not, while mad we ha&s;te along,</L>
<L>The gentle voice of peace, or plea&s;ure's &s;ong?</L>
<L>Or wherefor think die flowery mountain's &s;ide,</L>
<L>The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</L>
<L>Why think we the&s;e le&s;s plea&s;ing to behold,</L>
<L>Than dreary de&s;erts, if, they lead to gold?</L></Q>
But, however ju&s;t the&s;e &s;entiments may appear to thof&s;e
who have not revolted from nature and &s;implicity, had
the author proclaimed them in Lombard-&s;treet, or
Cheap&s;ide, he would, not have been complimented with
the under&s;tanding of the bellman.&mdash;A &s;triking proof
<PB N="90" REF="89">
that our own particular ideas of happine&s;s regulate
our opinions concerning the &s;en&s;e and wi&s;dom of o|thers!</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to take leave of this mo&s;t beautiful
eclogue without paying the tribute of admiration &s;o
ju&s;tly due to the following nervous lines.
<Q><L>What if the lion in his rage I meet!&mdash;</L>
<L>Oft in the du&s;t I view his printed feet:</L>
<L>And fearful! oft, when day's declining light</L>
<L>Yields her pale empire to thc mourner night,</L>
<L>By hunger rous'd, he &s;cours the groaning plain,</L>
<L>Gaunt wolves and fullen tygers in his train:</L>
<L>Before them death with &s;hrieks directs their way,</L>
<L>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.</L></Q>
This, among&s;t many other pa&s;&s;ages to be met with in
the writings of Collins, &s;hews that his genius was
perfectly capable of the grand and magnificent in de|&s;cription,
notwith&s;tanding what a learned writer has
advanced to the contrary. Nothing, certainly, could
be more greatly conceived, or more adequately ex|pre&s;&s;ed
than the image in the la&s;t couplet.</P>
<P>THAT deception, &s;ometimes u&s;ed in rhetoric and
poetry, which pre&s;ents us with an object, or &s;en|timent
contrary to what we expected, is here intro|duced
to the greate&s;t advantage:
<Q><PB N="91" REF="90">
<L>Farewell the youth, whom &s;ighs could not detain,</L>
<L>Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain!</L>
<L>Yet as thou go'&s;t, may every bla&s;t ari&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>Weak and unfelt as the&s;e rejected &s;ighs!</L></Q>
But this, perhaps, is rather an artificial prettyne&s;s,
than a real, or natural beauty.</P>

<P>THAT innocence, and native &s;implicity of man|ners,
which, in the fir&s;t eclogue, was allowed
to con&s;titute the happine&s;s of love, is here beautifully
de&s;cribed in its effects. The Sultan of Per&s;ia marries
a Georgian &s;hepherde&s;s, and finds in her embraces
that genuine felicity which unperverted nature alone
can be&s;tow. The mo&s;t natural and beautiful parts of
this eclogue are tho&s;e where the fair Sultana refers
with &s;o much plea&s;ure to her pa&s;toral amu&s;ements,
and tho&s;e &s;cenes of happy innocence in which &s;he had
pa&s;&s;ed her early years; particularly when, upon her
fir&s;t departure,
<Q><L>Oft as &s;he went, &s;he backward turn'd her view,</L>
<L>And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu.</L></Q>
This picture of amiable &s;implicity reminds one of that
pa&s;&s;age, where Pro&s;erpine, when carried off by Plu|to,
regrets the lo&s;s of the flowers &s;he had been ga|thering.</P>

<HEAD>ECLOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE beautiful, but unfortunate country, where
the &s;cene of this pathetic eclogue is laid, had
been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its
&s;avage neighbours, when Mr. Collins &s;o affectingly
de&s;cribed its misfortunes. This ingenious man had
not only a pencil to pourtray, but a heart to feel for
the mi&s;eries of mankind, and it is with the utmo&s;t
tenderne&s;s and humanity he enters into the narrative
of Circa&s;&s;ia's ruin, while he realizes the &s;cene, and
brings the pre&s;ent drama before us. Of every cir|cum&s;tance
that could po&s;&s;ibly contribute to the tender
effect this pa&s;toral was de&s;igned to produce, the poet
has availed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t art and addre&s;s.
Thus he prepares the heart to pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
Circa&s;&s;ia, by repre&s;enting it as the &s;cene of the hap|pie&s;t
love.</P>
<Q><L>In fair Circa&s;&s;ia, where, to love inclin'd,</L>
<L>Each &s;wain was ble&s;t, for every maid was kind.</L></Q>
<P>To give the circum&s;tances of the dialogue a more af|fecting
&s;olemnity, he makes the time midnight, and
<PB N="94" REF="93">
de&s;cribes the two &s;hepherds in the very act of flight
from the de&s;truction that &s;wept over their country:
<Q><L>Sad o'er the dews, two brother &s;hepherds fled,</L>
<L>Where wildering fear and de&s;perate &s;orrow led:</L></Q>
There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet <HI>wilder|ing,</HI>
which &s;trikes us more forcibly, the more we con|&s;ider
it.</P>
<P>THE opening of the dialogue is equally happy,
natural and unaffected; when one of the &s;hepherds,
weary and overcome with the flight, calls upon his
companion to review the length of way they had pa&s;&s;|ed.&mdash;This
is, certainly, painting from nature, and the
thoughts, however obvious, or de&s;titute of refinement,
are perfectly in character. But as the clo&s;e&s;t pur&s;uit
of nature is the &s;ure&s;t way to excellence in general,
and to &s;ublimity in particular, in poetical de&s;cripti|on,
&s;o we find that this &s;imple &s;ugge&s;tion of the &s;hep|herd
is not unattended with magnificence. There is
grandeur and variety in the land&s;kip he de&s;cribes:
<Q><L>And fir&s;t review that long extended plain,</L>
<L>And yon wide groves, already pa&s;t with pain!</L>
<L>Yon ragged cliff, who&s;e dangerous path we tried!</L>
<L>And la&s;t, this lofty mountain's weary &s;ide.</L></Q>
<PB N="95" REF="94">
There is, in imitative harmony, an act of expre&s;&s;ing
a &s;low and difficult movement by adding to the u&s;ual
number of pau&s;es in a ver&s;e. This is ob&s;ervable in
the line that de&s;cribes the a&s;cent of the mountain:
<Q>And la&s;t &Verbar; this lo&s;ty mountain's &Verbar; weary &s;ide &Verbar;</Q>
Here we find the number of pau&s;es, or mu&s;ical bars,
which, in an heroic ver&s;e, is commonly two, increa&s;|ed
to three.</P>
<P>THE liquid melody, and the numerous &s;weetne&s;s of
expre&s;&s;ion in the following de&s;criptive lines is almo&s;t
inimitably beautiful:
<Q><L>Sweet to the fight is Zabran's flowery plain,</L>
<L>And once by nymphs and &s;hepherds lov'd in vain!</L>
<L>No more the virgins &s;hall delight to rove</L>
<L>By Sargis' banks, or Irwan's &s;haddy grove;</L>
<L>On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale,</L>
<L>Or breathe the &s;weets of Aly's flowery vale.</L></Q>
Neverthele&s;s in this delightful land&s;kip there is an ob|vious
&s;ault: there is no di&s;tinction between the plain
of Zabran and the vale of Aly; they are both <HI>flowery,</HI>
and con&s;equently undiver&s;i&s;ied. This could not pro|ceed
from the poet's want of judgment, but from in|attention:
it had not occurred to him that he had
<PB N="96" REF="95">
employed the epithet <HI>flowery</HI> twice within &s;o &s;hort a
compa&s;s; an over&s;ight which tho&s;e who are accu|&s;tomed
to poetical, or, indeed, to any other &s;pecies
of compo&s;ition, know to be very po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more beautifully conceived, or
more pathetically expre&s;&s;ed than the &s;hepherd's ap|prehen&s;ions
for his fair country-women, expo&s;ed to
the ravages of the invaders.</P>
<Q><L>In vain Circa&s;&s;ia boa&s;ts her &s;picy groves,</L>
<L>For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves:</L>
<L>In vain &s;he boa&s;ts her faire&s;t of the fair,</L>
<L>Their eye's blue langui&s;h, and their golden hair!</L>
<L>Tho&s;e eyes in tears their fruitle&s;s grief &s;hall &s;end;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e hairs the Tartar's cruel hand &s;hall rend.</L></Q>
<P>There is, certainly, &s;ome very powerful charm in the
liquid melody of &s;ounds. The editor of the&s;e poems
could never read, or hear the following ver&s;e repeat|ed
without a degree of plea&s;ure otherwi&s;e entirely un|accountable:
<Q>Their eye's <HI>blue languish,</HI> and their <HI>golden hair.</HI></Q>
Such are the Oriental Eclogues, which we leave with
the &s;ame kind of anxious plea&s;ure we feel upon a tem|porary
parting with a beloved friend.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, etc.</HEAD>
<P>THE genius of COLLINS was capable of every de|gree
of excellence in lyric poetry, and perfectly
qualified for that high province of the mu&s;e. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
of a native ear for all the varieties of harmony and
modulation, &s;u&s;ceptible of the fine&s;t feelings of ten|derne&s;s
and humanity, but, above all, carried away
by that high enthu&s;ia&s;m, which gives to imagination
its &s;tronge&s;t colouring, he was, at once, capable of
&s;oothing the ear with the melody of his numbers, of
influencing the pa&s;&s;ions by the force of his <HI>pathos,</HI> and
of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of de&s;cription.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e powers, but, more parti|cularly,
in con&s;ideration of the la&s;t, he cho&s;e &s;uch
&s;ubjects for his lyric e&s;&s;ays as were mo&s;t favourable for
the indulgence of de&s;cription and allegory; where he
could exerci&s;e his powers in moral and per&s;onal paint|ing;
where he could exert his invention in con|ferring
new attributes on images or objects already
known, and de&s;cribed, by a determinate number of
characteri&s;tics; where he might give an uncommon
eclat to his figures, by placing them in higher atti|tudes
<PB N="100" REF="98">
or in more advantageous lights, and introduce
new forms from the moral and intellectual world into
the &s;ociety of inper&s;onated beings.</P>
<P>SUCH, no doubt, were the advantages he derived
from the de&s;criptive and allegorical nature of his
themes.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to have been the whole indu&s;try of our
author (and it is, at the &s;ame time, almo&s;t all the
claim to moral excellence his writings can boa&s;t) to
promote the influence of the &s;ocial virtues, by paint|ing
them in the faire&s;t and happie&s;t lights.
<Q>Melior fieri tuendo,</Q>
would be no improper motto to his poems in general,
but of his lyric poems it &s;eems to be the whole moral
tendency and effect. If, therefor, it &s;hould appear
to &s;ome readers that he has been more indu&s;trious to
cultivate de&s;cription than &s;entiment; it may be ob|&s;erved
that his de&s;criptions them&s;elves are &s;entimental,
and an&s;wer the whole end of that &s;pecies of writing,
by embelli&s;hing every feature of virtue, and by con|veying,
through the effects of the pencil, the fine&s;t
moral le&s;&s;ons to the mind.</P>
<P>HORACE &s;peaks of the fidelity of the ear in pre&s;e|rence
to the uncertainty of the eye; but if the mind
receives conviction, it is, certainly, of very little im|portance
<PB N="101" REF="99">
through what medium, or by which of the
&s;en&s;es it is conveyed. The impre&s;&s;ions left on the
imagination may, po&s;&s;ibly, be thought le&s;s durable
than the depo&s;its of the memory, but it may very
well admit of a que&s;tion whether a conclu&s;ion of rea|&s;on,
or an impre&s;&s;ion of imagination, will &s;oone&s;t make
its way to the heart. A moral precept conveyed in
words is only an account of truth in its effects; a mo|ral
picture is truth exemplified; and which is mo&s;t
likely to gain on the affections, it may not be difficult
to determine.</P>
<P>THIS, however, mu&s;t be allowed, that tho&s;e works
approach the neare&s;t to perfection which unite the&s;e
powers and advantages; which at once influence the
imagination, and engage the memory; the former
by the force of animated, and &s;triking de&s;cription,
the latter by a brief but harmonious conveyance of
precept: thus, while the heart is influenced through
the operation of the pa&s;&s;ions, or the fancy, the effect,
which might otherwi&s;e have been tran&s;ient, is &s;ecur|ed
by the co-operating power of the memory, which
trea&s;ures up in a &s;hort aphori&s;m the moral of the
&s;cene.</P>
<P>THIS is a good rea&s;on, and this, perhaps, is the
only rea&s;on that can be given, why our dramatic per|formances
&s;hould generally end with a chain of coup|lets.
In the&s;e the moral of the whole piece is u&s;ually
<PB N="102" REF="100">
conveyed, and that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the memory bor|rows
from rhyme, as it was probably the original
cau&s;e of it, gives its u&s;efulne&s;s and propriety even there.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e apologies for the <HI>de&s;criptive</HI> turn of
the following odes, &s;omething remains to be &s;aid on
the origin and u&s;e of <HI>allegory</HI> in poetical compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>BY this we are not to under&s;tand the trope in the
&s;chools, which is defined <HI>aliud verbis, aliud &s;en&s;u
o&s;tendere,</HI> and of which Quintilian &s;ays, <HI>U&s;us e&s;t, ut
tri&s;tia dicamus melioribus verbis, out bonae rei gratia
quaedam contrariis &s;ignificemus,</HI> etc. It is not the ver|bal,
but the &s;entimental allegory, not allegorical ex|pre&s;&s;ion
(which, indeed, might come under the term
of <HI>metaphor</HI>) but allegorical imagery, that is here
in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHEN we endeavour to trace this &s;pecies of figu|rative
&s;entiment to its origin, we find it coeval with
literature it&s;elf. It is generally agreed that the mo&s;t
ancient productions are poetical, and it is certain
that the mo&s;t ancient poems abound with allegorical
imagery.</P>
<P>IF, then, it be allowed that the fir&s;t literary pro|ductions
were poetical, we &s;hall have little or no diffi|culty
in di&s;covering the origin of allegory.</P>
<P>At the birth of letters, in the tran&s;ition from hiero|glyphical
to literal expre&s;&s;ion, it is not to be wonder|ed
if the cu&s;tom of expre&s;&s;ing ideas by per&s;onal ima|ges
<PB N="103" REF="101">
which, had &s;o long prevailed, &s;hould &s;till retain
its influence on the mind, though the u&s;e of letters
had rendered the practical application of it &s;uperflu|ous.
Tho&s;e who had been accu&s;tomed to exprefs
&s;trength by the image of an elephant, &s;wiftne&s;s by
that of a panther, and courage by that of a lion,
would make no &s;cruple of &s;ub&s;tituting, in letters, the
&s;ymbols for the ideas they had been u&s;ed to repre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>HERE we plainly &s;ee the origin of <HI>allegorical expre&s;|&s;ion,</HI>
that it aro&s;e from the <HI>a&s;hes</HI> of hieroglyphics;
and if to the &s;ame cau&s;e we &s;hould refer that figura|tive
boldne&s;s of &s;tyle and imagery which di&s;tingui&s;h
the oriental writings, we &s;hall, perhaps, conclude
more ju&s;tly, than if we &s;hould impute it to the &s;upe|rior
grandeur of the ea&s;tern genius.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame &s;ource with the <HI>verbal,</HI> we are to
derive the <HI>&s;entimental</HI> allegory, which is nothing more
than a continuation of the metaphorical or &s;ymbolical
expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal agents in an action, or the
different objects in a &s;cene.</P>
<P>The latter mo&s;t peculiarly comes under the denomi|nation
of allegorical imagery; and in this &s;pecies of
allegory we include the imper&s;onation of pa&s;&s;ions, af|fections,
virtues and vices, <HI>etc.</HI> on account of which,
principally, the following odes were properly termed
by their author, allegorical.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="102">
WITH re&s;pect to the utility of this figurative writ|ing,
the &s;ame arguments, that have been advanced in
favour of de&s;criptive poetry, will be of weight like|wi&s;e
here. It is, indeed from imper&s;onation, or, as
it is commonly termed per&s;onification, that poetical
de&s;cription borrows its chief powers and graces. With|out
the aid of this, moral and intellectual painting
would be flat and unanimated, and even the &s;cenery
of material objects would be dull without the intro|duction
of fictitious life.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations will be mo&s;t effectually illu|&s;trated
by the &s;ublime and beautiful odes that occa&s;i|oned
them: in tho&s;e it will appear how happily this
allegorical painting may be executed by the genuine
powers of poetical genius, and they will not fail to
prove its force and utility by pa&s;&s;ing through the ima|gination
to the heart.</P>

<HEAD>ODE TO FEAR.</HEAD>
<P>MR. C&mdash;who had often determined to apply
him&s;elf to dramatic poetry, &s;eems here, with
the &s;ame view, to have addre&s;&s;ed one of the princi|pal

<L>And I, O Fear, will dwell with thee!</L></Q>
In the con&s;truction of this nervous ode the author has
&s;hewn equal power of judgment and imagination.
Nothing can be more &s;triking than the violent and ab|rupt
abbreviation of the mea&s;ure in the fifth and &s;ixth
ver&s;es, when he feels the &s;trong influences of the pow|er
he invokes:
<Q><L>Ah Fear! ah frantic Fear!</L>
<L>I &s;ee, I &s;ee thee near.</L></Q>
The editor of the&s;e poems has met with nothing in
the &s;ame &s;pecies of poetry, either in his own, or in
<PB N="108" REF="106">
any other language, equal, in all re&s;pects, to the fol|lowing
de&s;cription of Danger.
<Q><L>Danger, who&s;e limbs of giant-mold,</L>

<L>Howling amid&s;t the midnight &s;torm,</L>
<L>Or throws him on the ridgy &s;teep</L>
<L>Of &s;ome loo&s;e, hanging rock to &s;leep.</L></Q>
It is impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate the image conveyed in
the two la&s;t ver&s;es without the&s;e emotions of terror it
was intended to excite. It has, moreover, the entire
advantage of novelty to recommend it; &s;or there is
too much originality in all the circum&s;tances to &s;up|po&s;e
that the author had in his eye that de&s;cription
of the penal &s;ituation of Cataline in the ninth AEneid:
<Q><L>&mdash;Te, Catalina, minaci</L>
<L>Pendentem &s;copulo&mdash;</L></Q>
The archetype of the Engli&s;h poet's idea was in na|ture,
and probably, to her alone he was indebted, for
the thought. From her, likewi&s;e, he derived that
magnificence of conception, that horrible grandeur
of imagery di&s;played in the following lines.
<Q><PB N="109" REF="107">

That nutritive enthu&s;ia&s;m, which cheri&s;hes the &s;eeds of

ail the influences of fiction. A pa&s;&s;ion for whatever

<P>THIS ode is &s;o infinitely ab&s;tracted and replete
with high enthu&s;ia&s;m, that it will find few readers
capable of entering into the &s;pirit of it, or of reli&s;h|ing
its beauties. There is a &s;tyle of &s;entiment as ut|terly
unintelligible to common capacities, as if the
&s;ubject were treated in an unknown language; and it
is on the &s;ame account that ab&s;tratcted poetry will ne|ver
have many admirers. The authors of &s;uch po|ems
mu&s;t be content with the approbation of tho&s;e
heaven-favoured geniu&s;es, who, by a &s;imiliarity of
ta&s;te and &s;entiment, are enabled to penetrate the high
my&s;terics of in&s;pired fancy, and to pur&s;ue the loftie&s;t
flights of enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination. Neverthele&s;s the
prai&s;e of the di&s;tingui&s;hed few is certainly preferable
to the applau&s;e of the undi&s;cerning million; for all
prai&s;e is valuable in proportion to the judgment of
tho&s;e who con&s;er it.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubject of this ode is uncommon, &s;o are the
&s;tyle and expre&s;&s;ion highly metaphorical and ab&s;tract|ed;

of this mode of expre&s;&s;ion here, and it a&s;&s;ords us new
proofs of the analogy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between language
and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more lo&s;tily imagined than the
creation of the Ce&s;tus of Fancy in this ode: the alle|gorical
imagery is rich and &s;ublime: and the ob&s;er|vation
that, the dangerous pa&s;&s;ions kept aloof, during

<HEAD>ODE TO EVENING.</HEAD>
<P>THE blank ode has for &s;ome time &s;olicited ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the Engli&s;h poetry; but its efforts
hitherto &s;eem to have been vain, at lea&s;t its recepti|on
has been no more than partial. It remains a que|&s;tion,
then, whether there is not &s;omething in the
nature of blank ver&s;e le&s;s adapted to the lyric than to
the heroic mea&s;ure, &s;ince, though it has been gene|rally
received in the latter, it is yet unadopted in the
former. In order to di&s;cover this, we are to con&s;ider
the different modes of the&s;e different &s;pecies of poetry.
That of the heroic is uniform; that of the lyric is va|rious:
and in the&s;e circum&s;tances of uniformity and
variety, probably, lies the cau&s;e why blank ver&s;e
has been &s;ucce&s;sful in the one, and unacceptable in
the other. While it pre&s;ented it&s;elf only in one form,
it was familiarized to the ear by cu&s;tom; but where
it was obliged to a&s;&s;ume the different &s;hapes of the ly|ric
mu&s;e, it &s;eemed &s;till a &s;tranger of uncouth figure,
was received rather with curio&s;ity than with plea&s;ure,
and entertained without that ea&s;e, or &s;atisfaction,
which acquaintance and familiarity produce&mdash;More|over,
the heroic blank ver&s;e obtained a &s;anction of
infinite importance to its general reception, when it
<PB N="122" REF="120">
was adopted by one of the greate&s;t poets the world e|ver
produced, and was made the vehicle of the no|ble&s;t
poem that ever was written. When this poem
at length extorted that applau&s;e which ignorance and
prejudice had united to withhold, the ver&s;ification &s;oon
found its imitators, and became more generally &s;uc|ce&s;sful
than even in tho&s;e countries from whence it was
imported. But lyric blank ver&s;e has met with no &s;uch
advantages; for Mr. Collins, who&s;e genius and judg|ment
in harmony might have given it &s;o powerful an
effect, has left us but one &s;pecimen of it in the Ode to
Evening.</P>
<P>IN the choice of his mea&s;ure he &s;eems to have had
in his eye Horace's ode to Pyrrha; for this ode bears
the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to that mixt kind of the a&s;cle|piad
and pherecratic ver&s;e; and that re&s;emblance in
&s;ome degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme, while
it reminds us of tho&s;e great ma&s;ters of antiquity,
who&s;e works had no need of this whim&s;ical jingle
of &s;ounds.</P>
<P>FROM the following pa&s;&s;age one might be induced
to think that the poet had it in view to render his &s;ub|ject
and his ver&s;ification &s;uitable to each other on this
occa&s;ion, and that, when he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the
&s;ober power of evening, he had thought proper to lay
a&s;ide the &s;oppery of rhyme;
<Q><PB N="123" REF="121">
<L>Now teach me, Maid compos'd,</L>
<L>To breathe &s;ome <HI>&s;o&s;ten'd</HI> &s;train,</L>
<L>Who&s;e numbers &s;tealing thro' thy dark'ning vale,</L>
<L>May not un&s;eemly with its <HI>&s;tillne&s;s</HI> &s;uit;</L>
<L>As, mu&s;ing &s;low, I hail</L>
<L>Thy genial, lov'd return!</L></Q>
But whatever were the numbers, or the ver&s;ification
of this ode, the imagery and enthu&s;ia&s;m it contains
could not fail of rendering it delightful. No other of
Mr. Collins's odes is more generally characteri&s;tic of
his genius. In one place we di&s;cover his pa&s;&s;ion for
vi&s;ionary beings:
<Q><L>For when thy &s;olding &s;tar ari&s;ing &s;hews</L>
<L>His paly circlet, at his warning lamp</L>
<L>The fragrant Hours and Elves</L>
<L>Who &s;lept in buds the day,</L></Q>
<Q><L>And many a nymph, who wreaths her brows with fedge,</L>
<L>And &s;heds the fre&s;hening dew, and, lovelier &s;till,</L>
<L>The pen&s;ive plea&s;ures &s;weet</L>
<L>Prepare thy &s;hadowy car.</L></Q>
In another we behold his &s;trong bias to melancholy:
<Q><PB N="124" REF="122">
<L>Then let me rove &s;ome wild and heathy &s;cene,</L>
<L>Or find &s;ome ruin 'mid&s;t its dreary dells,</L>
<L>Who&s;e walls more awful nod</L>
<L>By thy religious gleams.</L></Q>
Then appears his ta&s;te for what is wildly grand and
magnificent in nature; when, prevented by &s;torms
from enjoying his evening walk, he wi&s;hes for a &s;itu|ation,
<Q><L>That from the mountain's &s;ide,</L>
<L>Views wilds and &s;welling floods.</L></Q>
And, through the whole, his invariable attachment to
the expre&s;&s;ion of painting;
<Q><L>&mdash;and marks o'er all</L>
<L>Thy dewy fingers draw</L>
<L>The gradual, du&s;ky veil.</L></Q>
It might be a &s;ufficient encomium on this beautiful
ode to ob&s;erve, that it has been particularly admired
by a lady to whom Nature has given the mo&s;t perfect
principles of ta&s;te. She has not even complained of
the want of rhyme in it, a circum&s;tance by no means
unfavourable to the cau&s;e of lyric blank ver&s;e; &s;or
&s;urely, if a fair reader can endure an ode without
bells and chimes, the ma&s;culine genius may di&s;pen&s;e
with them.</P>

&s;eems not improbable that the author wrote it
about the time when he left the Univer&s;ity; when, wea|ry

confined him&s;elf to the &s;earch of theoretical know|lege,

<P>THE following farewell to &s;cience exhibits a very
ju&s;t as well as &s;triking picture; for however exalted
in the theory the Platonic doctrines may appear, it is

it is not far from the regions of doubt; and the great|er
its capacity to think ab&s;tractedly, to rea&s;on and re|fine,

the more it will be expo&s;ed to and bewildered in
uncertainty.&mdash;From an enthu&s;ia&s;tic warmth of temper,
indeed, we may for a while be encouraged to per&s;i&s;t
in &s;ome adopted &s;y&s;tem; but when that enhu&s;ia&s;m,
which is founded on the vivacity of the pa&s;&s;ions, gra|dually
cools and dies away with them, the opinions
it &s;upported drop from us, and we are thrown upon

<L>There, where the young-ey'd, healthful Wit,</L>
<L>(Who&s;e jewels in his. cri&s;ped hair</L>
<L>Are plac'd each other's beams to &s;hare,</L>

Nothing could be more expre&s;&s;ive of wit, which con|&s;i&s;ts

<Q><L>O Humour, thou who&s;e name is known</L>

The author could only mean to apply this to the
time when he wrote, &s;ince other nations had produc|ed
works of great humour as he him&s;elf acknowleges
afterwards.
<Q><L>By old Miletus, <HI>etc.</HI></L>
<L>By all you taught the Tu&s;can maids, <HI>etc.</HI></L></Q>
The Mile&s;ian and Tu&s;can romances were by no means
di&s;tingui&s;hed for humour; but as they were the mo|dels
of that &s;pecies of writing in which humour was
afterwards employed, they are, probably for that
rea&s;on only, mentioned here.</P>

<HEAD>THE PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Ode for Mu&s;ic.</HEAD>
<P>IF the mu&s;ic, which was compo&s;ed for this ode, had
equal merit with the ode it&s;elf, it mu&s;t have been
the mo&s;t excellent performance of the kind, in which
poetry and mu&s;ic have, in modern times, united.
Other pieces of the &s;ame nature have derived their
greate&s;t reputation from the perfection of the mu&s;ic
that accompanied them, having in them&s;elves little
more merit than that of an ordinary ballad: but in
this we have the whole &s;oul and power of poetry&mdash;Expre&s;&s;ion
that, even without the aid of mu&s;ic, &s;trikes
to the heart; and imagery, of power enough to tran|&s;port
the attention without the forceful alliance of
corre&s;ponding &s;ounds! what, then, mu&s;t have been
the effect of the&s;e united!</P>
<P>IT is very ob&s;ervable that though the mea&s;ure is
the &s;ame, in which the mu&s;ical efforts of fear, anger
and de&s;pair are de&s;cribed, yet by the variation of the
cadence, the character and operation of each is &s;trong|ly
expre&s;&s;ed: thus particularly of de&s;pair:
<Q><PB N="129" REF="127">
<L>With woeful mea&s;ures wan De&s;pair&mdash;</L>
<L>Low &s;ullen &s;ounds his grief beguil'd,</L>
<L>A &s;olemn, &s;trange and mingled air,</L>
<L>'Twas &s;ad by fits; by &s;tarts 'twas wild.</L></Q>
He mu&s;t be a very un&s;kilful compo&s;er who could not
catch the power of imitative harmony from the&s;e lines.</P>
<P>THE picture of Hope that follows this is beautiful
almo&s;t beyond imitation. By the united powers of ima|gery
and harmony, that delightful Being is exhibited
with all the charms and graces that plea&s;ure and fan|cy
have appropriated to her:
<Q><L>Relegat, qui &s;emel percurrit;</L>
<L>Qui nunquam legit, legat.</L></Q>
<Q><L>But thou, O Hope! with eyes &s;o fair,</L>
<L>What was thy delighted mea&s;ure?</L>
<L>Still it whi&s;per'd promis'd plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>And bad the lovely &s;eenes at di&s;tance hail!</L>
<L>Still would her touch the &s;train prolong,</L>
<L>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</L>
<L>She call'd on Echo &s;till thro' all the &s;ong;</L>
<L>And where her &s;weete&s;t theme &s;he cho&s;e,</L>
<L>A &s;oft re&s;pon&s;ive voice was heard at every clo&s;e,</L>
<L>And Hope enchanted &s;mil'd, and wav'd her gold|en
hair.</L></Q>
<PB N="130" REF="128">
In what an exalted light does the above &s;tanza place
this great ma&s;ter of imagery and harmony! what va|ried
&s;weetne&s;s of numbers! what delicacy of judg|ment
and expre&s;&s;ion! how characteri&s;tically does Hope
prolong her &s;train, repeat her &s;oothing clo&s;es, call
upon her a&s;&s;ociate Echo for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, and
di&s;play every plea&s;ing grace peculiar to her!
<Q>And Hope enchanted &s;mil'd, and wav'd her golden
hair.</Q>
<Q><L>Legat, qui nunquam legit;</L>
<L>Qui &s;emel percurrit, relegat.</L></Q>
The de&s;criptions of joy, jealou&s;y and revenge are ex|cellent,
though not equally &s;o; tho&s;e of melancholy
and chearfulne&s;s are &s;uperior to every thing of the
kind; and, upon the whole, there may be very little
hazard in a&s;&s;erting that this is the fine&s;t ode in the
Engli&s;h language.</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addre&s;&s;ed to Sir THOMAS HANMER, on his Edition

<P>THIS poem was written by our author at the

Hanmer's pompous edition of Shake&s;pear was printed
at Oxford. If it has not &s;o much merit as the re&s;t of
his poems, it has &s;till more than the &s;ubject de&s;erves.
The ver&s;ification is ea&s;y and genteel, and the allu&s;i|ons
always poetical. The character of the poet Flet|cher
in particular is very ju&s;tly drawn in this epi&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ODE,
ON THE
DEATH OF MR. THOMSON.</HEAD>
<P>MR. COLLINS had <HI>&s;kill to complain.</HI> Of that
mournful melody and tho&s;e tender images
which are the di&s;tingui&s;hing excellencies of &s;uch pie|ces
as bewail departed friend&s;hip, or beanty, he was
<PB N="132" REF="130">
an almo&s;t unequalled ma&s;ter. He knew perfectly to
exhibite &s;uch circum&s;tances, peculiar to the objects,
as awaken the influences of pity; and while, from his
own great &s;en&s;ibility, he felt what he wrote, he na|turally
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the feelings of others.</P>
<P>To read &s;uch lines as the following, all beautiful
and tender as they are, without corre&s;ponding emo|tions
of pity, is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible:
<Q>The tender thought on thee &s;hall dwell.</Q>
<Q><L>Each lonely &s;cene &s;hall thee re&s;tore,</L>
<L>For thee the tear be duly &s;hed;</L>
<L>Belov'd, 'till life can charm no more;</L>
<L>And mourn'd, 'till Pity's &s;elf be dead.</L></Q>
The ode on the death of Thom&s;on &s;eems to have been
written in an excur&s;ion to Richmond by water. The
rural &s;cenery has a proper effect in an ode to the me|mory
of a poet, much of who&s;e merit lay in de&s;crip|tions
of the &s;ame kind, and the appellations of
"Druid" and "meek nature's child" are happily
characteri&s;tic. For the better under&s;tanding of this
ode, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remember that Mr. Thom&s;on
lies buried in the church of Richmond.</P>
