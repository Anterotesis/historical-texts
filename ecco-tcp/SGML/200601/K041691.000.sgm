<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the
Counte&s;s of HERTFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE always ob&s;er|ved
that, in Addre&s;&s;es of
this Nature, the general
Ta&s;te of the World de|mands
ingenious Turns of Wit, and
<PB REF="5">
di&s;gui&s;ed artful Periods, in&s;tead of
an open Sincerity of Sentiment flow|ing
in a plain Expre&s;&s;ion. From
what &s;ecret Impatience of the ju&s;te&s;t
Prai&s;e, when be&s;towed on Others,
this often proceeds, rather than a
pretended Delicacy, is beyond my
Purpo&s;e here to enquire. But as no|thing
is more foreign to the Di&s;po|&s;ition
of a Soul &s;incerely plea&s;ed
with the Contemplation of what is
beautiful, and excellent, than Wit and
Turn; I have too much Re&s;pect for
your Lady&s;hip's Character, either to
touch it in that gay, trifling Man|ner,
or venture on a particular Detail
<PB REF="6">
of tho&s;e truly amiable Qualities of
which it is compo&s;ed. A Mind ex|alted,
pure, and elegant, a Heart
overflowing with Humanity, and the
whole Train of Virtues thence deri|ved,
that give a plea&s;ing Spirit to
Conver&s;ation, an engaging Simplici|ty
to the Manners, and form the Life
to Harmony, are rather to be felt,
and &s;ilently admired, than expre&s;&s;ed.
I have attempted, in the following
Poem, to paint &s;ome of the mo&s;t
tender Beauties, and delicate Appear|ances
of Nature; how much in vain,
your Lady&s;hip's Ta&s;te will, I am
afraid, but too &s;oon di&s;cover: Yet
<PB REF="7">
would it &s;till be a much ea&s;ier Task
to find Expre&s;&s;ion for all that Va|riety
of Colour, Form, and Fra|grance,
which enrich the Sea&s;on I
de&s;cribe, than to &s;peak the many
namele&s;s Graces, and Native Riches
of a Mind capable &s;o much at once
to reli&s;h Solitude, and adorn So|ciety.
To whom then could the&s;e
Sheets be more properly in&s;cribed
than to You, MADAM, who&s;e In|fluence
in the World can give them
the Protection they want, while
your fine Imagination, and intimate
Acquaintance with <HI>Rural Nature,</HI> will
recommend them with the greate&s;t
<PB REF="8">
Advantage to your favourable No|tice?
Happy! if I have hit any
of tho&s;e Images, and corre&s;pon|dent
Sentiments, your calm Even|ing
Walks, in the mo&s;t delightful
Retirement, have oft in&s;pired. I
could add too, that as this Poem
grew up under your Encourage|ment,
it has therefore a natural
Claim to your Patronage. Should
You read it with Approbation, it's
Mu&s;ick &s;hall not droop; and &s;hould
it have the good Fortune to de|&s;erve
your Smiles, it's Ro&s;es &s;hall
not wither. But, where the Sub|ject
is &s;o tempting, le&s;t I begin
<PB REF="9">
my Poem before the Dedication is
ended, I here break &s;hort, and beg
Leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf, with
the highe&s;t Re&s;pect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>

Humble Servant,

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the following Poem appears at pre&s;ent
in Publick, is not any way in Prejudice of
the Propo&s;als I lately Publi&s;hed for Printing the
<HI>FOUR SEASONS, &amp;c.</HI> by Sub&s;cription, but
at the Solicitation of &s;ome of my Friends who
had &s;een it in Manu&s;cript, and the better to
carry on a Work I &s;tand engaged to fini&s;h.
For <HI>Sub&s;cription</HI> is now at its la&s;t Ga&s;p,
and the World &s;eems to have got the better of
that many-headed Mon&s;ter. However, tho&s;e
Gentlemen and Ladies who have been, or
may hereafter be &s;o good as to honour me
with their Names, &s;hall have the Book next
Winter according to my Propo&s;als: And if
it &s;hould, in any Degree, be judged worthy their
Encouragement, I have my be&s;t Reward.</P>

<L>Thro' Fore&s;ts huge, and long untravel'd Heaths</L>
<L>With De&s;olation brown, he wanders wa&s;te,</L>
