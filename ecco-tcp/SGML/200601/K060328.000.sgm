<HEAD>THE
Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Treati&s;e is but a
&s;mall part of a Volume of Cri|tici&s;m
intended to be publi&s;h'd
in Folio, in which in Treating of the works
of the mo&s;t Celebrated Engli&s;h Poets De|ceas'd,
I de&s;ign'd to &s;hew both by Rea&s;on
and Examples, that the u&s;e of Religion in
Poetry was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e it
to the greate&s;t exaltation, of which &s;o No|ble
an Art is capable, and on the other &s;ide,
that Poetry was requi&s;ite to Religion in order to
its making more forcible Impre&s;&s;ions upon
the Minds of Men.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
And this I thought would be an effectu|al
way of Reconciling People to a Regu|lated
Stage, in &s;pight of the Grimaces of
&s;ome Spiritual Comedians; who have them|&s;elves
a mind to be the only Actors in
Vogue; and who in order to a total &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Stage, have endeavour'd to
&s;et up private Authorities again&s;t the
common Sen&s;e of Mankind, and the Er|rors
of two or three Churchmen again&s;t
Divine In&s;piration. For I appeal to any
impartial Reader, whether the con&s;tant
practice in all Ages of the be&s;t and the
bravest Nations in their mo&s;t flouri&s;hing
States, may not pa&s;s for the common
Sen&s;e of Men: And we know very well
that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whom we believe to be di|vinely
in&s;pir'd, has made u&s;e of Heathen
Poets nay ev'n Heathen Dramatick Poets,
for the Reformation of Mankind. Witne&s;s
that famous pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Evil Communicati|ons
corrupt good manners;</HI> which St.
<HI>Paul</HI> makes u&s;e of in his Second Epistle
to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and which <HI>Grotius</HI>
informs us that he borrow'd from the
<HI>Thais</HI> of the famous <HI>Menander.</HI> Now how
that which was the Language of the Holy
Gho&s;t, in the Mouth of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> comes
to be the Language of the Devil in ours,
I believe our Bigots will find it a Difficult
matter to &s;hew.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
It it plain then that the&s;e Per&s;ons by de|&s;igning
totally to &s;uppre&s;s the Stage, which
is the only encouragement that we have
in the&s;e I&s;lands of Poetry, manife&s;tly in|tended
to drive out &s;o noble and u&s;eful an
Art from among us, and by that means
endeavour'd with all their might to weak|en
the power of Religion, which has need
of Poetry to make its utmost Impre&s;&s;ion
upon the Minds of Men.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, almo&s;t all but the Ceremonial
and Hi&s;torical part of the old Te&s;tament,
was deliver'd in Poetry and that is almo&s;t
Half of it. And a con&s;iderable part of the
Doctrine of the Go&s;pel was deliver'd in Pa|rables,
which, as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> has ju&s;t|ly
ob&s;erv'd in his Advancement of Lear|ning
<HI>Lib. 2 Chap.</HI> I. are a kind of Di|vine
Poe&s;y. I might here very truly ob|&s;erve,
that not only <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Song and part of the Prophets, but &s;eve|ral
too of our Saviours Parables, are tho'
not Dramatick Poems, yet Poe&s;y that is
Dramatical, that is Poe&s;y in which Per&s;ons
are introduc'd who are talking in Dia|logue.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
From what has been &s;aid, this Con&s;e|quence
mu&s;t undeniably follow, that either
they who deliver'd our Religion were mi|&s;taken
in the manner of doing it, which
will by no means con&s;i&s;t with our Belief
of the Divinity of one of them, or the
Divine Inspiration of the Re&s;t, or that
our Religion mu&s;t be mo&s;t powerfully pro|pagated
by the &s;ame means, by which it
was at fir&s;t deliver'd.</P>
<P>I believe that it would be an ea&s;ie
matter to prove, that it was the u&s;e of
exalted Poe&s;y, &s;uch as the lofty Hymn of
St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> that blew up the Flame of
Chri&s;tian zeal to &s;uch a tran&s;porting
height, in the Primitive and Apo&s;tolical
times, and that the neglect of &s;o Divine
an art, has not only in the&s;e latter Days
con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en'd the force of Religion,
but has with &s;ome People among us gone
a very great way towards the making the
Publick Wor&s;hip contemptible. But I leave
it to our Prelates and Pa&s;tors to con&s;ider,
whether, &s;ince they are &s;atisfy'd that there
is a nece&s;&s;ity, for an Harmonious and a
Numerous Style, in &s;ome parts of our Pub|lick
Wor&s;hip, they ought &s;o long to have
remain'd contented with the vile Meetre
of <HI>Hopkins,</HI> and by that proceeding to
&s;uffer the mo&s;t Lofty and mo&s;t Pathetick
<PB REF="6">
Divine Poetry to be Burle&s;qu'd and Ri|dicul'd
in our Churches, which is all one,
as if each Sunday they &s;hould dre&s;s up a
Bi&s;hop in &s;ome Antick Habit, and ex|po&s;e
him in that merry Garb in Order to
rai&s;e the Veneration of the People.</P>
<P>That Poetry is nece&s;&s;ary for the infor|cing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
may I think appear very plainly from
what has been &s;aid, and from what will be
&s;aid upon that Subject in the following
Treati&s;e. But &s;ince our Clergy by their con|&s;tant
practi&s;e appear to be already &s;atis|fyed
of it, I leave it to them to con&s;i|der,
whether they ought not rather to
make it part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;et Po|etry
and con&s;equently the Stage upon a
good Foot, than to endeavour with all their
might to drive out both from among us.</P>
<P>Since I mention'd my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> a|bove,
I de&s;ire the Readers leave to lay
before him a mo&s;t Beautiful Pa&s;&s;age of
that great genius concerning the worth
and the u&s;e of Poetry, which he e&s;teems
to be the Second principal Bruanch of
Learning.</P>
<P>As for Narrative Poe&s;y (&s;ays he in
the 13 <HI>Ch.</HI> of the 2 <HI>Lib.</HI> of his Ad|vancement
of Learning) or, if you
<PB REF="7">
plea&s;e, Heroical, &s;o you under&s;tand it
of the Matter, not of the Ver&s;e, it
&s;eems to be rais'd altogether from a
noble Foundation, which makes much
for the Dignity of Man's Nature.
For &s;eeing the &s;en&s;ible World is in
Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man,
Poe&s;y &s;eems to endow human Nature,
with that which Hi&s;tory denies, and
to give &s;atisfaction to the Mind,
with at lea&s;t the Shadow of things,
where the Sub&s;tance cannot be had.
For if the matter be throughly con&s;i|der'd
a &s;trong Argument may be drawn
from Poetry, that a more &s;tately
Greatne&s;s of things, a more perfect
Order, and a more beautiful Variety,
delights the Soul of Man, than can
be any way found in Nature, &s;ince
the fall. Wherefore &s;eeing the Acts
and events, which are the Subject of
True Hi&s;tory, are not of that ampli|tude
as to content the Mind of Man,
Poe&s;y is ready at Hand to fain Acts
more Heroical. Becau&s;e true Hi&s;tory
reports the Succe&s;&s;es of Bu&s;ine&s;s not
proportionable to the merit of Vir|tues
and Vices, Poe&s;y corrects it, and
pre&s;ents Events and Fortunes ac|cording
to De&s;ert; and according to
the Law of Providence. Becau&s;e true
Hi&s;tory, through the frequent Satiety
<PB REF="8">
and Similitude of things, works a
Di&s;ta&s;t and Mi&s;pri&s;ion in the Mind
of Men, Poetry Cheereth and Refre&s;h|es
the Soul; Chanting things rare and
various, and full of Vici&s;&s;itudes, &s;o as
Poetry &s;erveth and conferreth to De|lectation,
Magnanimity, and Morality;
and therefore it may &s;eem de&s;erved|ly
to have &s;ome Participation of Di|vinene&s;s;
becau&s;e it doth rai&s;e the
Mind, and exalt the Spirit with high
Raptures, by proportioning the Shews
of things to the De&s;ires pf the Mind,
and not &s;ubmitting the Mind to
things, as Rea&s;on and Hi&s;tory do.
And by the&s;e Allurements and Con|gruities,
whereby it cheri&s;heth the Soul
of Men, joyned al&s;o with Con&s;ort of
Mu&s;ick, whereby it may more &s;weet|ly
in&s;inuate it &s;elf, it hath won &s;uch
Acce&s;s, that it hath been in E&s;tima|tion,
even in Rude Times, and Bar|barous
Nations, when other Learning
&s;tood excluded.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e that Poetry which we call
Heroick, has been but barely neglected
among us, and the great Cry has been
again&s;t the Dramatick, let us &s;ee what the
&s;ame extraordinary Per&s;on &s;ays in De|fence
of that.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">
Dramatick or Repre&s;entative Poe&s;y,
&s;ays he, which brings the World up|on
the Stage, is of excellent u&s;e if it
were not abus'd. For the in&s;tructi|ons
and Corruptions of the Stage may
be great; but the Corruptions in this
kind abound; the Di&s;cipline is altoge|ther
neglected in our times. For al|tho'
in Modern Commonwealths, Stage-Plays
be but e&s;teemed a Sport or Pa&s;|time,
unle&s;s they draw from the Satyr
and be mordant; yet the Care of the An|tients
was, that the Stage &s;hould in|&s;truct
the Minds of Men unto Vir|tue.
Nay, wi&s;e Men and great Phi|lo&s;ophers,
have accounted it as the
Archet or Mu&s;ical Bow of the Mind.
And certainly it is mo&s;t true, and as
it were a Secret of Nature, that the
Minds of Men are more patent to
Affections, and Impre&s;&s;ions Congregate
than Solitary.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Ob&s;ervation which is per|fectly
Beautiful, my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> has gi|ven
a very &s;olid Rea&s;on, why the Drama
mu&s;t be more u&s;eful than History, and more
prevalent than Philo&s;ophy. And a little
lower he has given two more, though he has
applied them to a &s;ort of Poetry which is
&s;omewhat different, and tho&s;e are, that
<PB REF="10">
Dramatick Fables are more &s;en&s;ible than
Arguments; and more fit than Examples.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that extraordinary
Man declares like a most ju&s;t and discern|ing
Judge, that the Modern Stage was but
a Shadow of the Antient, and an imperfect
Shadow; that it had &s;omething of its Shew,
but nothing of its Reality; that is, that it
was not only a vain and an empty, but a
dangerous Amu&s;ement. And he plainly
taxes the Modern Policy with the Neg|lect
of its Di&s;cipline. Indeed in this as
well as other things, there is as great a
difference between Antient and Modern
Policy, as there is between Antient and
Modern Extent of Empire.</P>
<P>But the Wi&s;dom of the Queen can ne|ver
be too much extolled, who has vouch|&s;afed
to take care of that which all Her
Predece&s;&s;ors neglected.</P>
<P>That Di&s;cerning Prince&s;s is re&s;olved to
&s;upport the Stage, that it may be in&s;tru|mental
to the Reforming Her People; and
She is re&s;olved to Regulate it, that it
may no longer be ju&s;tly accus'd of corrupt|ing
their Manners.</P>
<P>The following Treati&s;e, as has been &s;aid
above, is but a &s;mall Portion of a much
<PB REF="11">
larger which was de&s;ign'd for the Improve|ment
of Modern Poetry, and of the Dra|ma
particularly. And here I de&s;ire the
Reader's Leave to do two things. Fir&s;t
to lay down the De&s;ign and Method of the
larger Treati&s;e, and then to give an Ac|count
to the World why no more is Pub|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign then, and the Method of
the whole Treati&s;e, as they were deliver'd
in the Second Propo&s;al, are as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="proposal">
<PB REF="12">
<HEAD>THE
PROPOSAL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FIr&s;t,</HI> The De&s;ign is To re&s;tore
Poetry to all its Greatne&s;s, and
to all its Innocence.</P>
<P>That Poetry is mi&s;erably fall'n, is,
I &s;uppo&s;e, granted: And, as there
never was more occa&s;ion for a ju&s;t
and impartial <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> on account
of the generality of the Writers;
&s;o, there never was more nece&s;&s;ity
for one on account of the Readers
and the Spectators. For the ta&s;te
of both the Readers and the Specta|tors
was never &s;o debauch'd as if is
<PB REF="13">
at pre&s;ent; of which we have given
the Rea&s;ons in another place. Some
of them would be thought to ap|prove
of every thing that they
either Read or See, and value them|&s;elves
upon that; that is, upon their
want of Di&s;cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h
right from wrong: Others are &s;o
&s;queami&s;h, that they like nothing,
and value them&s;elves&punc; even upon
that too; that is, upon the &s;ickline&s;s
and the un&s;oundne&s;s of their Minds;
becau&s;e he who likes nothing ta&s;tes
nothing, and want of Ta&s;te is want
of Sen&s;e. But this is not all: even
they who pretend to like nothing,
will at the Play-hou&s;es be pleas'd
with ev'ry thing; and they who
would be thought to approve of eve|ry
thing, like nothing long; For
nothing but Truth can be long e|&s;teem'd,
and Truth it &s;elf, to be
long e&s;teem'd, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;h'd
from Fal&s;hood. From the&s;e ran|dom
ways of Judging it comes to
pa&s;s, that this Town, in the com|pa&s;s
of ten Years, happens to have
one and the &s;ame Author in the
<PB REF="14">
greate&s;t Admiration and in the ut|mo&s;t
Contempt; which is infinitely
a greater Satyr upon the Town,
than it can be on the Author; for
the Town is certainly in the
wrong in one of the Extreams at
lea&s;t, and perhaps in both; whereas
the Authors, for the mo&s;t part,
give no occa&s;ion for either of them.
This random or this partial way
of Judging, has been the cau&s;e
that Poetry is bani&s;h'd from the
re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and is upon its la&s;t
Legs in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the fore&s;aid Trea|ti&s;e
is, not only to retrieve &s;o noble
an Art, and to fix the Rules both
of Writing and of Judging, that
both Readers and Writers may be
at &s;ome certainty; but, to rai&s;e it
to a height which it has never
known before among us, and to
re&s;tore it, as we &s;aid above, to
all its Greatne&s;s, and to all its
Innocence.</P>
<P><PB REF="15">
But whereas &s;everal may imagine
that the De&s;ign is chimerical, of
re&s;toring Poetry either to its Great|ness
or to its Innocence, we think
it proper to &s;atisfie the Reader, in
as few words as we can, that
both may be ea&s;ily effected.</P>
<P>1. Poetry may ea&s;ily be re&s;tored
to its former Greatne&s;s, becau&s;e
the di&s;covering the Cau&s;e of a Di|&s;ea&s;e
is more than half the Cure
of it: but the true and almo&s;t
only Cau&s;e of the Declention of
Poetry, that Cau&s;e which has lain
hid for &s;o many Ages, has been
already di&s;covered in a little Tract
that was published two Years
ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Advancement and Reformation of Modern Poetry&punc;</NOTE>, for which I have the Opini|on
of &s;everal of the be&s;t Judges
in <HI>England,</HI> and that matter will
be &s;et in &s;o clear a Light in the
beginning of the fore&s;aid Treati&s;e,
without repeating any thing that
was &s;aid before, or at lea&s;t as little
as may be, as may &s;atisfie the mo&s;t
incredulous. But,</P>
<P><PB REF="16">
2. Poetry may ea&s;ily be re&s;tored
to its Innocence by taking a pro|per
Method, a Method that may
be more prevalent with the Wri|ters
than either Law or Philo&s;ophy,
which have been us'd in vain. For
let us but con&s;ider the Character
that <HI>Horace</HI> has giv'n of a Poet,
<Q><L>Vatis avarus</L>
<L>Non temere e&s;t animus, ver&s;us amet, hoc &s;tudet unum,</L>
<L>Detrimenta, fugas &s;ervorum; incendia ridet.</L></Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, a Poet will contemn
every thing but the acquiring the
Reputation of a good Poet. This
is what he makes his only Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and the &s;ole de&s;ign of his Life;
and there is no Reprimand that
you can give him, and no Remon|&s;trance
that you can make him,
that he will not laugh at, until
you convince him that he is an ill
Poet. And indeed he is partly in
the right; for an ill Poet is ten
<PB REF="17">
times more ridiculous than a
Blockhead of any other Profe&s;&s;ion:
for an ill Phy&s;ician, or an ill Law|yer,
know their own Ignorance,
and make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to be
e&s;teem'd by the People: but, on
the contrary, an ill Poet is found
out by every body, and admires
him&s;elf, than which nothing can
be more a Je&s;t. So that there is
nothing he will refu&s;e to do to
avoid the Infamy of that Reputa|tion.
From whence it follows that
in the fore&s;aid <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> there is a
Motive that will work more &s;trong|Iy
upon them than the Cen&s;ures
of our Reformers: for there we
clearly &s;hew them, that Poetry, by
lo&s;ing its Innocence, lo&s;es its very
Nature; for if Poetry be more
philo&s;ophical, and more in&s;tru|ctive,
than Hi&s;tory, as <HI>Ari&s;to|tle</HI>
is pleas'd to affirm of it, and
no Man ever knew the Nature ei|ther
of Poetry, or of Hi&s;tory, or
of Philo&s;ophy, better than he did;
why then that Art, or rather that
Artifice, with which a great ma|ny
Writers of Ver&s;es and Plays de|bauch
<PB REF="18">
and corrupt the People, is
a thing to which Poetry is as di|rectly
contrary, as a Virgin is to
a Whore. And the&s;e People are no
more Poets, than tho&s;e Empricks
are Phy&s;icians who make their <HI>Jack-Puddings</HI>
&s;wallow Potions to re|commend
them to the People,</P>
<P>In the fore&s;aid Treati&s;e we clear|ly
&s;hew them, that Piety and Vir|tue
was not only the fir&s;t Original,
but that it has been, is and will
be, the only &s;olid Ba&s;is, nay and
the very Life and Soul of the Great|er
Poetry. That the farther Poe|try
declines from that, the farther
it recedes from its very Nature
and E&s;&s;ence; and that the true
Poetry is as incon&s;i&s;tent and as
incompatible with Vice, as the
Harmony, and Light, and Rap|tures
of Heaven with the gloomy
Horrors of Hell; and the proving
this in &s;o clear a manner as we
pretend to do, will oblige tho&s;e
Poets who are never &s;o profligate
in their Inclinations, to be virtu|ous
at lea&s;t in their Writings.</P>
<P><PB REF="19">
Both they and their Readers
will then be &s;atisfied, that the true
Poetical Genius is a great and a
&s;acred thing; and, to quote an Ad|mirable
pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Milton,</HI> 'Is,
wherever it is found, the in&s;pir'd
Gift of God, rarely be&s;tow'd, but
yet to &s;ome (&s;ays he) in ev'ry
Nation, tho' mo&s;t abu&s;e it: and is
of power, be&s;ide the Office of a
Pulpit, to imbreed and cheri&s;h in
a great People the Seeds of Vir|tue
and publick Civility, to allay
the Perturbations of the Mind,
and &s;et the Affections in a right
Tune, to celebrate in glorious and
lofty Hymns the Throne and
Equipage of God's Almightine&s;s,
and what he works, and what
he &s;uffers to be wrought with
high providence in his Church; to

and Saints, the Deeds and

again&s;t the Enemies of Chri&s;t; to

<PB REF="20">
Kingdoms and States from Ju&s;tice

Whatever in Religion is holy and
&s;ublime, in Virtue amiable or
grave, whatever hath Pa&s;&s;ion or
Admiration in all the changes of
that which is call'd Fortune from
without, or the wily Subtleties
and Refluxes of Man's Thoughts
from within; all the&s;e things
with a &s;olid and treatable Smooth|ne&s;s
to point out and de&s;cribe;
teaching over the whole Book of
Sanctity and Virtue, thro' all the
in&s;tances of example, with &s;uch de|light,
to tho&s;e e&s;pecially of &s;oft
and delicious temper, who will
not &s;o much as look upon Truth
her &s;elf, unle&s;s they &s;ee her ele|gantly
dre&s;t; that whereas the
paths of Hone&s;ty arid Good-life ap|pear
now rugged and difficult,
tho' they be indeed ea&s;ie and plea|&s;ant,
they would then appear to
all Men both ea&s;ie and plea&s;ant,
tho' they were rugged and diffi|cult
indeed. And what a Bene|fit
this would be to our Youth
<PB REF="21">
and Gentry (<HI>continues he</HI>) may be
&s;oon gue&s;t by what we know of
the Corruption and Bane which
they &s;uck in daily from the Wri|tings
and Interludes of libidinous
and ignorant Poeta&s;ters, who ha|ving
&s;carce ever heard of that
which is the main Con&s;i&s;tence of
a true Poem, the Choice of &s;uch
per&s;ons as they ought to introduce,
and what is moral and decent to
each one, do for the mo&s;t part lap
up vicious Principles in &s;weet
Pills to be &s;wallow'd down, and
make the ta&s;te of virtuous Do|cuments
har&s;h and four.' Thus
far goes <HI>Milton:</HI> And the Reader
may &s;ee that it was his Opinion,
That tho Poetry was in the main
mi&s;erably &s;unk among us; yet, that
it might be re&s;tor'd to its Inno|cence,
and its Greatne&s;s. In or|der

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Method that we
follow in the foremention'd <HI>Criti|ci&s;m</HI>
<PB REF="22">
We begin then with a <HI>Critici&s;m</HI>
upon Poetry in general; in which
we endeavour to &s;hew its Nature,
and its End, and the means which
it ought to u&s;e for the attaining
that End. And then we come to,
divide Poetry into its two great
Branches, the (Greater and the Le&s;s.</P>
<P>1. We treat of the Greater Poe|try,
&s;hew what its Nature and its
End are; and that the only certain
Method for the attaining its End,
is, the keeping &s;trictly up to its Na|ture,
which &s;eems to have been hi|therto
not very clearly under&s;tood.
And here we &s;hall lay down &s;ome
general Rules, which are both few
and &s;hort, but eternal and unal|terable;
and for the want of ob|&s;erving
which, it will appear
throughout this whole Treati&s;e,
that the very be&s;t among the An|cients,
and among the Moderns,
have not only made gro&s;s Mi&s;takes,
but have deviated &s;ometimes, in a
great degree, from the Art.</P>
<P><PB REF="23">
And here too We endeavour to
&s;hew the mutual Dependance that
the Greater Poetry has on Reli|gion,
and Religion on the Greater
Poetry; and to make it appear,
that all tho&s;e parts of the Old Te&s;ta|ment
which were writ id Ver&s;e,
ought to be tran&s;lated in Ver&s;e, by
Rea&s;ons which may have force e|nough
to convince us, that Ver&s;e
tran&s;lated into Pro&s;e is but half
tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>When we have done this, We
come to Heroick Poetry; which
being a Branch of the Greater
Poetry, mu&s;t have the &s;ame End,
and mu&s;t participate of the &s;ame
Nature; and mu&s;t be&s;ides, have
&s;omething particular in its Nature
to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other two
Branches, which are Tragedy, and
the Greater Ode. But becau&s;e too
much bare Speculation may prove
tedious to &s;everal Readers, we
&s;hew what every Poet who writes
an Epick Poem is oblig'd to do, to
make that Poem keep to the Nature
<PB REF="24">
of Epick Poetry in general, and to
its own: This, I &s;ay, we endeavour
to &s;hew, not by laying down the
Rules after the common Method,
but by &s;hewing what <HI>Virgil</HI> has
done; becau&s;e that great Poet is &s;o
exact, that he may be &s;aid to have
written a <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> upon Epick
Poetry by Examples, and becau&s;e
he is now, by Mr. <HI>Dryden's</HI> Tran|&s;lation,
to be reckon'd among our
own Poets; and &s;o comes within
the compa&s;s of my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>When by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, we come
briefly to examine, Whether tho&s;e
Rules are always to be kept invio|lable;
and if they are not, in what
parts, and by whom, they may be
alter'd. Then we &s;hew how <HI>Spencer,</HI>
by not following tho&s;e Rules, fell &s;o
very far &s;hort of the Ancients; And
afterwards we endeavour to make
it appear, how <HI>Milton,</HI> by daring
to break a little loo&s;e from them
in &s;ome particulars, kept up in &s;e|veral
others to the Nature of the
<PB REF="25">
Greater Poetry in general, and of E|pick
Poetry in particular, better
than the be&s;t of the Ancients. Af|ter
this we treat of the other <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Poets, who have written any
thing that comes near to Heroick
Poetry; and &s;hew of them all, as we
go along, how they differ from one
another, how from the be&s;t of the
Ancient Poets, and the be&s;t of the
Moderns of other Countries.</P>
<P>The Branch of the Greater Poetry
which we con&s;ider next is Tragedy,
which we treat of after the &s;ame
manner with Heroick Poetry, and
&s;hew what ev'ry one who writes a
Tragedy is oblig'd to do, to make
that Poem come up to the Nature
of the Greater Poetry in general,
and of Tragedy in particular, by
&s;hewing what <HI>Sophocles</HI> has done in
his <HI>OEdipus</HI> (which will be there
tran&s;lated) and for what Rea&s;ons;
where we endeavour to di&s;play the
Beauties of his admirable Conduct,
and to clear the Moral by a very
different Method from what <HI>Mon|&s;ieur
Dacier</HI> has taken. And af|ter
<PB REF="26">
that by doing this we have
laid down the Rules, the fir&s;t of any
length that were ever extant in Eng|li&s;h
we by tho&s;e examine the Plays
of our mo&s;t celebrated Tragick Poets,
in their Fables, Characters. Senti|ments,
Expre&s;&s;ions, Harmony; &s;hew
what di&s;tingui&s;hes them, from one
another, from the be&s;t of the Anci|ents,
and the mo&s;t famous Mo|derns
of other Countries. And
here we make it our bu&s;ine&s;s to
&s;hew how much the pre&s;ent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Stage is degenerated from the Virtue
and Greatne&s;s of the Ancient Tra|gedy,
and what is to be done to
re&s;tore Modern Tragedy fir&s;t to the
Innocence, and &s;econdly to the
Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Stage.
And here we examine whether it is
not po&s;&s;ible to advance <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tra|gedy
to a greater Height than ever
the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poets arriv'd.</P>
<P>In the next place we de&s;cend to the
third and la&s;t Branch of the Greater
Poetry, which is the Greater Ode,
which we treat of after the &s;ame
<PB REF="27">
manner with the two preceding, and
&s;hew what the compo&s;er of &s;uch an
Ode is oblig'd to do, to make it keep
up to the Nature of the Greater Poe|try
in general, and to its own. And
here we have occa&s;ion to take no|tice,
that of the&s;e three Branches of
Poetry, the Ode is the mo&s;t dege|nerated:
For &s;ince the Nature of
Poetry con&s;i&s;ts in Pa&s;&s;ion; and that
of the Greater Poetry in great Pa&s;&s;i|on,
as we make it appear in the
foremention'd <HI>Crtici&s;m;</HI> and &s;ince
that which we commonly call Pa|&s;&s;ion
is very rarely to be found in
the Greater Ode, it follows that
the excellence of the Greater Ode
mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in extraordinary Pa|&s;&s;ion,
which can be nothing but
&s;trong <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> but Religion is
the greate&s;t, noble&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t
&s;ource of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> as we very
clearly &s;hew; &s;o that the Modern
Ode, by for &s;aking Religion, and be|coming
for the mo&s;t part prophane,
has parted with that from which
it deriv'd its greate&s;t excellence.</P>
<P><PB REF="28">
And that the excellence of the
Greater Ode is deriv'd from Reli|gion,
we make appear not only
by the Examples of tho&s;e very
few which are admirable among
our own, but by tho&s;e of <HI>Pindar</HI>
and <HI>Horace;</HI> and we &s;hew that
the fir&s;t of tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters
was &s;o throughly convinc'd of this
at the &s;ame time, that he was
oblig'd, by the de&s;ire of Gain, to
celebrate the Triumphs of worth|le&s;s
Coachmen and Jockeys, that
his numerous extravagant Digre&s;&s;i|ons
are to be attributed, in a
great mea&s;ure, to that Conviction
join'd with that Obligation. When
we have done this,</P>
<P>2. We de&s;cend to the other di|vi&s;ion
of Poetry, which is the
Le&s;s and &s;hall treat of tho&s;e
Branches of it in which our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Poets are mo&s;t concern'd, after
the &s;ame Method that we treated
of tho&s;e of the Greater. Where
fir&s;t we &s;hall &s;peak of the Little
<PB REF="29">
Ode, and &s;hew for what Rea&s;ons
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets have, for the
mo&s;t part mi&s;carried in it. Then
we &s;hall give the Reader a large
<HI>Critici&s;m</HI> upon Comedy, the fir&s;t of
any Moment that will be extant
upon it in any Language. And
here we &s;hall endeavour to make
it appear, that as the Moderns
have apparently the advantage of
the Ancients in Comedy, the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
have it of the re&s;t of the Mo|derns.</P>
<P>We &s;hall end with a <HI>Critici&s;m</HI>
upon Satyr, where we &s;hall &s;hew
the true difference between that
and a Libel or Lampoon; and the
u&s;efulne&s;s of the one, and de&s;tru|ctivene&s;s
of the other.</P>
<P>Thus have we laid before the
Reader. the De&s;ign and Method of
the Work. But becau&s;e the di&s;|cerning
Reader cannot but &s;ee,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Book|&s;eller
to make it worth the Un|dertaker's
Trouble in employing &s;o
<PB REF="30">
much Time and Thought as &s;o
great and important a De&s;ign re|quires,
the lovers of <HI>Critici&s;m</HI> are
therefore de&s;ir'd, at lea&s;t tho&s;e who
have Spirit enough to promote &s;o
generous an Undertaking, to en|courage
it by their Sub&s;criptions at
the Rate of a Guinea a Book, pay|ing
half a Guinea down at the
time of &s;ub&s;cribing, and half at
the delivery of the Book in
Quires; the Undertaker at the
&s;ame time, promi&s;ing, that not a

the number &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>

<HEAD>SPECIMEN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being the Sub&s;tance of what
will be &s;aid in the Begin|ning
of the Critici&s;m upon
Mil-ton.</HEAD>
<P>THE next Poet of whom
we &s;hall treat is <HI>Mil|ton,</HI>
one of the greate&s;t and
mo&s;t daring Genius's that
has appear'd in the World,
and who has made his Coun|try
a glorious pre&s;ent of the
mo&s;t lofty, but mo&s;t irregu|lar
Poem, that has been pro|duc'd
by the Mind of Man.
That great Man had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;ire
to give the World &s;omething
like an Epick Poem; but he re&s;olv'd
at the &s;ame time to
<PB REF="32">
break thro' the Rules of
<HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> Not that he was ig|norant
of them, or contem|n'd
them. On the contrary, no
Man knew them better, or e|&s;teemed
them more, becau&s;e no
Man had an Under&s;tanding
that was more able to com|prehend
the nece&s;&s;ity of them;
and therefore when he men|tion'd
them in the little
Treati&s;e which he wrote to
Mr. <HI>Hartlib,</HI> he calls the
Art which treats of them, a
&s;ublime Art. But at the &s;ame
time he had di&s;crenemnt e|nough
to &s;ee, that if he wrote
a Poem which was within
the compa&s;s of them, he &s;hould
be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Fate
which has attended all who
have wrote Epick Poems e|ver
&s;ince the time of <HI>Homer;</HI>
<PB REF="33">
and that is to be a Copyi&s;t
in&s;tead of an Original. Tis
true, the Epick Poets who
have liv'd &s;ince <HI>Homer,</HI> have
mo&s;t of them been Originals
in their Fables, which are
the very Souls of their Po|ems;
but in their manner of
treating tho&s;e Fables, they
have too frequently been Co|pyi&s;ts,
They have Copyed
the Spirit and the Images of
<HI>Homer;</HI> even the great <HI>Vir|gil</HI>
him&s;elf is not to be ex|cepted.
<HI>Milton</HI> was the fir&s;t,
who in the &s;pace of almo&s;t
4000&punc; Years, re&s;olved, for his
Country's Honour and his
own, to pre&s;ent the World
with an Original Poem;
that is to &s;ay, a Poem that
&s;hould have his own Thoughts,
his own Images, and his
<PB REF="34">
own Spirit. In order to this
he was re&s;olved to write a
Poem, that, by vertue of its
extraordinary Subject, cannot
&s;o properly be &s;aid to be a|gain&s;t
the Rules, as it may
be affirmed to be above them
all. He had ob&s;erv'd, that
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> had drawn his Rules
which he has given us for
Epick Poetry from the Re|flections
which he had made
upon <HI>Homer.</HI> Now he knew
very well, that in <HI>Homer</HI> the
Action lay chiefly between
Man and Man: For <HI>Achilles</HI>
and <HI>Hector</HI> are properly the
Principals, and the Gods are
but Seconds. He was re&s;ol|ved
therefore, that his Prin|cipals
&s;hould be the Devil on
one &s;ide and Man on the
other: and the Devil is pro|perly
<PB REF="35">
his Hero, becau&s;e he
gets the better. All the per|&s;ons
in his Poem, excepting
two, are either Divine or In|fernal.
So that mo&s;t of the
Per&s;ons and particularly one
of the Principals, being &s;o
very different from what
<HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ever
thought of, could not po&s;&s;i|bly
be &s;ubjected to their
Rules, either for the Cha|racters
or the Incidents. We
&s;hall now &s;hew for what Rea|&s;ons
the choice of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
Subject, as it &s;et him free
from the Obligation which
he lay under to the Poetical
Laws, &s;o it nece&s;&s;arily threw
him upon new Thoughts,
new Images, and an Origi|nal
Spirit. In the next place
we &s;hall &s;hew, that his
<PB REF="36">
Thoughts, his Images, and
by con&s;equence too his Spirit,
are actually new, and dif|ferent
from tho&s;e of <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil.</HI> Thirdly,
We &s;hall &s;hew, that be&s;ides
their Newne&s;s, they have
va&s;tly the Advantage of tho&s;e
of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> And
we &s;hall make this appear
from &s;everal things, but prin|cipally
from the De&s;cription of
Hell, which has been de&s;crib'd
by tho&s;e three great Poets
with all their Force and
with all their Art. After
that, we &s;hall proceed to &s;ay
&s;omething of <HI>Milton's</HI> Expre&s;|&s;ion
and his Harmony; and
then we &s;hall come to mark
his Defects with &s;o much
the more exactne&s;s, becau&s;e
&s;ome of them ought to be
<PB REF="37">
avoided with the utmo&s;t
Caution, as being &s;o great,
that they would be In&s;up|portable
in any one who had
not his extraordinary Di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
Qualities.</P>
<P>Thus have we laid before the Reader the
De&s;ign and Method, and Specimen of the
larger Treati&s;e, It now remains that I
&s;hould give an Account why &s;o &s;mall a
part of it is Publi&s;h'd. As &s;oon as I &s;et
about the Performance, I ea&s;ily fore&s;aw
that it would be a three Years Labour, and the
Judicious Reader, upon con&s;idering the Pro|po&s;al,
cannot but be convinc'd of it. Yet
after I had been for a whole Year Dige&s;ting
my own Thoughts, and con&s;idering other
Peoples, and making all &s;orts of Prepa|rations
for the due Execution of &s;o great a
De&s;ign: I &s;aw that all the Per&s;ons who
had Sub&s;crib'd, were they who&s;e Names the
Reader will find in the Order of their Sub|&s;cribing.</P>

<P>THE de&s;ign of the en&s;uing
Treati&s;e, whether we con&s;ider
the Importance or the Extent
of it, is perhaps the Greate&s;t in this
kind of Writing, that has been con|ceived

and ree&s;tabli&s;h the noble&s;t Art in
<PB N="2" REF="47">
every Branch of it; an Art that by
the Barbarity of the Times is fall'n

and is even here &s;o mi&s;erably fall'n

<P>That Poetry is the noble&s;t of all

in&s;tructive and mo&s;t beneficial to
Mankind, may be prov'd by the
concording Te&s;timony of the greate&s;t

the greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers, the grea|te&s;t

<HEAD>CHAP. II. That Poetry is to be E&s;tabli|&s;hed,
by laying down Rules.</HEAD>
<P>THAT an Art &s;o Divine in
its In&s;titution, is &s;unk and
profaned, and mi&s;erably deba&s;ed,
is a thing that is confe&s;t by all. But
&s;ince Poetry is fallen from the Ex|cellence
which it once attained to,
it mu&s;t be fallen either by the want
of Parts, or want of Indu&s;try, or
by the Errors of its Profe&s;&s;ors. But
that it cannot be for want of Parts,
we have &s;hewn clearly in the Ad|vancement
of modern Poetry; nor
can it be &s;uppo&s;ed to be for want of
Indu&s;try, &s;ince &s;o many of its Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
have no other Dependance?
It remains then that it mu&s;t have
fall'n by their Errors, and for want
of being guided right. Since there|fore
<PB N="5" REF="50">
'tis for want of knowing by
what Rules they ought to proceed,
that Poetry is fall'n &s;o low, it follows
then that it is the laying down of
tho&s;e Rules alone, that can re-e&s;tab|li&s;h
it. In &s;hort, Poetry is either
an Art, or Whim&s;ie and Fanatici&s;m.
If it is an Art, it follows that it mu&s;t
propo&s;e an end to it &s;elf, and after|wards
lay down proper Means for
the attaining that end: For this is
undeniable, that there are proper
Means for the attaining of every
end, and tho&s;e proper Means in Po|etry,
we call the Rules. Again, if
the end of Poetry be to in&s;truct and
reform the World, that is, to bring
Mankind from Irregularity, Extra|vagance
and Confu&s;ion, to Rule and
Order, how this &s;hould be done by
a thing that is in it &s;elf irregular and
extravagant, is difficult to be con|ceived.
Be&s;ides, the work of every
rea&s;onable Creature mu&s;t derive its
Beauty from Regularity, for Rea&s;on
is Rule and Order, and nothing can
be irregular either in our Concepti|ons
or our Actions, any further than
it &s;werves from Rule, that is, from
<PB N="6" REF="51">
Rea&s;on. As Man is the more perfect,
the more he re&s;embles his Creator:
The Works of Man mu&s;t needs be
more perfect, the more they re&s;emble
his Makers. Now the Works of God
tho' infinitely various, are extream|ly
regular.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;e is regular in all
its Parts, and it is to that exact
Regularity that it owes its admi|rable
Beauty. The Microco&s;m owes
the Beauty and Health both of its
Body and Soul to Order, and the De|formity
and Di&s;tempers of both, to
nothing but the want of Order. Man
was created like the re&s;t of the Crea|tures,
regular, and as long as he re|mained
&s;o he continued happy; but
as &s;oon as he fell from his Primitive
State, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing Order, Weak|ne&s;s
and Mi&s;ery was the immediate
Con&s;equence of that Univer&s;al Di&s;|order
that immediately followed.in
his Conceptions, in his Pa&s;&s;ions and
Actions.</P>
<P>The great de&s;ign of Arts is to
re&s;tore the decays that happen'd
to Humane Nature by the Fall,
by re&s;toring Order: The de&s;ign of
<PB N="7" REF="52">
Logick is to bring back Order,
and Rule, and Method to our Con|ceptions,
the want of which cau&s;es
mo&s;t of our Ignorance, and all our
Errors. The de&s;ign of moral Phy|lo&s;ophy
is to cure the di&s;order that
is found in our Pa&s;&s;ions, from which
proceeds all our Unhappine&s;s, and all
our Vice; as from the due order that
is &s;een in them, comes all our Ver|tue
and all our Plea&s;ure. But how
&s;hould the&s;e Arts ree&s;tabli&s;h Order,
unle&s;s they them&s;elves were Regu|lar?
Tho&s;e Arts that make the Sen|&s;es
in&s;trumental to the Plea&s;ure of
the Mind, as Painting and Mu&s;ick,
do it by a great deal of Rule and
Order, &s;ince therefore Poetry com|prehends
the force of all the&s;e
Arts of Logick, of Ethicks, of
Eloquence, of Painting, of Mu&s;ick;
can any thing be more ridiculous

<PB N="8" REF="53">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. What Poetry is, and that it
attains its end by exciting
of Pa&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;aid above, that as
Poetry is an Art, it mu&s;t have
a certain end, and that there mu&s;t
be means that are proper for the
attaining that end, which means
are otherwi&s;e call'd the Rules: But
that we may make this appear
the more plainly, let us declare what
Poetry is. Poetry then is an Art, by
which a Poet excites Pa&s;&s;ion (and
for that very cau&s;e entertains Sen&s;e)
in order to &s;atisfie and improve, to
delight and reform the Mind, and
&s;o to make Mankind happier and
better; from which it appears that
Poetry has two Ends, a &s;ubordinate
and a final one, the &s;ubordinate one
is Plea&s;ure, and the final one is In|&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="54">
Fir&s;t, The &s;ubordinate end of Poe|try
is to plea&s;e, for that Plea&s;ure is the
bu&s;ine&s;s and de&s;ign of Poetry is evi|dent,
becau&s;e Poetry unle&s;s it plea&s;es,
nay and plea&s;es to a height, is the
mo&s;t contemptible thing in the
World; other things may be born
with if they are indifferent, but
Poetry unle&s;s it is tran&s;porting is
abominable: nay it has only the
Name of Poetry, &s;o in&s;eparable is
Plea&s;ure from the very nature of
the Thing.</P>
<P>But Secondly, The final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners;
as Poetry is an Art, In&s;truction
mu&s;t be its final End; but either
that In&s;truction mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in re|forming
the Manners, or it can|not
in&s;truct at all, and con&s;equent|ly
be an Art; for Poetry pretends
to no other In&s;truction as its final
End: But &s;ince the final End of
Poetry is to reform the Manners,
nothing can be according to the true
Art of it which is again&s;t Religion,
or which runs counter to Moral Ver|tue,
or to the true Politicks, and to
the Liberty of Mankind; and every
<PB N="10" REF="55">
thing which is again&s;t the la&s;t, tends
to the Corruption and De&s;truction
of Mankind: And con&s;equently eve|ry
thing again&s;t the la&s;t, mu&s;t be ut|terly
incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Art
of Poetry.</P>
<P>Now the proper Means for Poe|try,
to attain both its &s;ubordinate
and final End, is by exciting Pa&s;&s;ion.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;ubordinate End of Poe|try,
which is to plea&s;e, is attained
by exciting Pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e every
one who is plea&s;ed is moved, and
either de&s;ires, or rejoices, or ad|mires,
or hopes, or the like. As
we are moved by Plea&s;ure which
is Happine&s;s, to do every thing
we do, we may find upon a little
Reflection, That every Man is in|cited
by &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion or other, ei|ther
to Action, or to Contemplation;
and Pa&s;&s;ion is the re&s;ult either of
Action or of Contemplation, as
long as either of them plea&s;e, and
the more either of them plea&s;es,
the more they are attended with
Pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;atisfaction that we
receive from Geometry it &s;elf comes
from the joy of having found out
<PB N="11" REF="56">
Truth, and the de&s;ire of finding
more. And the &s;atiety that &s;ei&s;es
us upon too long a Lecture, pro|ceeds
from nothing but from the
wearine&s;s of our Spirits, and con|&s;equently
from the ce&s;&s;ation or the
decay of tho&s;e two plea&s;ing Pa&s;|&s;ions.
But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Poetry attains its final
end, which is the reforming the
Minds of Men, by exciting of Pa&s;&s;i|on.
And here I dare be bold to af|firm,
that all In&s;truction whatever,
depends upon Pa&s;&s;ion. The Moral
Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, even the
drye&s;t of them, can never in&s;truct
and reform, unle&s;s they move; for
either they make Vice odious and
Vertue lovely, or they deter you
from one by the Apprehen&s;ion of Mi|&s;ery,
or they incite you to the other,
by the Happine&s;s they make you ex|pect
from it; or they work upon
your Shame, or upon your Pride, or
upon your Indignation. And there|fore
Poetry in&s;tructs and reforms
more powerfully than Philo&s;ophy
can do, becau&s;e it moves more pow|erfully:
And therefore it in&s;tructs
<PB N="12" REF="57">
more ea&s;ily too. For whereas all Men
have Pa&s;&s;ions, and great Pa&s;&s;ions of
one &s;ort or another, and whereas
tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions will be employed, and
whatever way they move, they that
way draw the Man, it follows that
Philo&s;ophy can in&s;truct but hardly,
becau&s;e it moves but gently; for the
violent Pa&s;&s;ions not finding their Ac|count
in tho&s;e faint emotions, begin
to rebel and fly to their old Objects,
whereas Poetry at the &s;ame time that
it in&s;tructs us powerfully, mu&s;t re|form
us ea&s;ily; becau&s;e it makes the
very Violence of the Pa&s;&s;ions contri|bute
to our Reformation: For the
generality of Mankind are apparent|ly
&s;wayed by their Pa&s;&s;ions, nay, and
perhaps the very be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of
them. The greate&s;t Philo&s;ophers
and the greate&s;t Princes are influ|enced
by their Favourites, and &s;o are
the wi&s;e&s;t Magi&s;trates. And 'tis for
this rea&s;on that not only the Devil,
who mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to under&s;tand
human nature, corrupts Mankind
by their Pa&s;&s;ions; (for Temptation
is nothing but the inclining Men to
&s;uch and &s;uch Actions, by the rai&s;|ing
<PB N="13" REF="58">
&s;uch and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions in them)
but God him&s;elf, who made the Soul,
and be&s;t under&s;tands its nature, con|verts
it by its Pa&s;&s;ions: For whereas
Philo&s;ophy pretends to correct hu|man
Pa&s;&s;ions by human Rea&s;on, that
is, things that are &s;trong and ungo|vernable,
by &s;omething that is feeble
and weak, Poetry by the force of the
Pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;tructs and reforms the
Rea&s;on; which is the De&s;ign of the
true Religion, as we have &s;hewn in
another place. So that we have here
already laid down one great Rule,
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ucceeding in Poetry:
For &s;ince it can attain neither
its &s;ubordinate nor its final End,
without exciting of Pa&s;&s;ion, it fol|lows,
that where there is nothing
which directly tends to the moving
of that, there can be no Poetry; and
that con&s;equently, a Poet ought to
contrive every thing in order to the
moving of Pa&s;&s;ion, that not only the
Fable, the Incidents and Characters,
but the very Sentiments and the Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
ought all to be de&s;igned
for that: For &s;ince Poetry plea&s;es
and in&s;tructs us more, even than
<PB N="14" REF="59">
Philo&s;ophy it &s;elf, only becau&s;e it
moves us more, it follows, that the
more Poetry moves, the more it
plea&s;es and in&s;tructs; and it is for
this rea&s;on that Tragedy, to tho&s;e
who have a Ta&s;t of it, is both more
plea&s;ing and more in&s;tructing, than
Comedy. And this naturally brings
us to the dividing Poetry into the
greater and the le&s;s.</P>
<P>1. The greater Poetry is an Art
by which a Poet ju&s;tly and rea&s;on|ably
excites great Pa&s;&s;ion, that he
may plea&s;e and in&s;truct, and com|prehends
Epick, Tragick, and the
greater Lyrick Poetry.</P>
<P>2. The le&s;s Poetry is an Art by
which a Poet excites le&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion for
the forementioned Ends; and in|cludes
in it, Comedy and Satyr, and
the little Ode, and Elegiack, and
Pa&s;toral Poems. But fir&s;t we &s;hall
treat of the former.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="15" REF="60">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. What the greater Poetry is,
what Enthu&s;ia&s;m is.</HEAD>
<P>THE greater Poetry then, is an
Art by which a Poet ju&s;tly and
rea&s;onably excites great Pa&s;&s;ion, in
order to plea&s;e and in&s;truct, and
make Mankind better and happier;
&s;o that the fir&s;t and grand Rule in
the greater Poetry is, that a Poet
mu&s;t every where excite great Pa&s;&s;i|on;
but in &s;ome Branches of the
greater Poetry, it is impo&s;&s;ible for a
Poet every where to excite in a very
great degree, that which we vul|garly
call Pa&s;&s;ion: As in the Ode
for Example, and in the Narration
of the Epick Poem. It follows then
that there mu&s;t be two &s;orts of Pa&s;&s;i|on.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That which we call Vul|gar
Pa&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Vulgar Pa&s;&s;ion or that
which we commonly call Pa&s;&s;ion,
is that which is moved by the Ob|jects
<PB N="16" REF="61">
them&s;elves, or by the Idea's
in the ordinary cour&s;e of Life,
I mean that common Society which
we find in the World. As for
Example, Anger is moved by an
Affront that is offered us in our
pre&s;ence, or by the relation of one;
Pitty by the &s;ight of a mournful
Object, or the relation of one;
Admiration or Wonder, (the com|mon
Pa&s;&s;ion I mean, for there is
an Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Admiration, as
we &s;hall find anon) by the &s;ight
of a &s;trange Object, or the relati|on
of one. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ion or
Enthu&s;ia&s;m, is a Pa&s;&s;ion which is
moved by the Idea's in Contem|plation
or the Meditation of Things,
that belong not to common Life:
Mo&s;t of our Thoughts in Medita|tion,
are naturally attended with
&s;ome &s;ort and &s;ome degree of Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and this Pa&s;&s;ion if it is &s;trong
I call Enthu&s;ia&s;m: Now, the En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ions are chiefly Six,
Admiration, Terror, Horror, Joy,
Sadne&s;s, De&s;ire, cau&s;ed by Idea's
occuring to us in Meditation, and
<PB N="17" REF="62">
producing the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions that the
Objects of tho&s;e Idea's would rai&s;e
in us, if they were &s;et before us
in the &s;ame Light that tho&s;e Idea's
give us of them. And here I de|&s;ire
the Reader to ob&s;erve, that
Idea's in Meditation, are often ve|ry
different from what Idea's of
the &s;ame Objects are, in the cour&s;e
of common Conver&s;ation. As for
Example, the Sun mention'd in or|dinary
Conver&s;ation, gives the Idea
of a round flat &s;hining Body, of
about Two Foot Diameter. But
the Sun occurring to us in Me|ditation,
gives the Idea of a|va&s;t
and glorious Body, and the
top of all the vi&s;ible Creation, and
the brighte&s;t material Image of the
Divinity. I leave the Reader there|fore
to judge, if this Idea mu&s;t
not nece&s;&s;arily be attended with
Admiration, and that Admiration
I call Enthu&s;ia&s;m. So Thunder men|tion'd
in common Conver&s;ation,
gives an Idea of a black Cloud,
and a great Noi&s;e, which makes
no great Impre&s;&s;ion upon us. But
the Idea of it occurring in Medi|tation,
<PB N="18" REF="63">
&s;ets before us the mo&s;t for|cible,
mo&s;t re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, and con&s;e|quently
the mo&s;t dreadful Phaeno|menon
in Nature: So that this I|dea
mu&s;t move a great deal of
Terror in us, and 'tis this &s;ort of
Terror that I call Enthu&s;ia&s;m.
And 'tis this &s;ort of Terror, or Ad|miration,
or Horror, and &s;o of the
re&s;t, which expre&s;t in Poetry,
make that Spirit, that Pa&s;&s;ion, and
that Fire which &s;o wonderfully
plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus there are two &s;orts of
Pa&s;&s;ions to be rais'd in Poetry, the
Vulgar and the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick, to
which la&s;t, the Vulgar is prefera|ble,
becau&s;e all Men are capable
of being moved by the Vulgar,
and a Poet writes to all: But the
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick are more &s;ubtle, and
Thou&s;ands have no feeling and no
notion of them; but where the
Vulgar cannot be moved in a great
degree, there the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick are
to be rais'd. Therefore in tho&s;e
parts of Epick Poetry, where the
Poet &s;peaks him&s;elf, or the Elde&s;t
of the Mu&s;es for him, the Enthu|&s;ia&s;tick
<PB N="19" REF="64">
Pa&s;&s;ions are to prevail, as
likewi&s;e in the greater Ode. And
the Vulgar Pa&s;&s;ions are to prevail
in tho&s;e parts of an Epick and
Dramatick Poem, where the Poet
introduces Per&s;ons holding Conver|&s;ation
together. And perhaps this
might be one Rea&s;on, for which
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> might prefer Tragedy to
Epick Poetry, becau&s;e the Vulgar
Pa&s;&s;ions prevail more in it, and
are more violently mov'd in it,
and therefore Tragedy mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
both plea&s;e, and in&s;truct
more generally than Epick Poetry.
We &s;hall then treat of the Vulgar
Pa&s;&s;ions when we come to &s;peak
of Tragedy, in which Poem they
ought mo&s;t to prevail; We &s;hall
then more particularly &s;hew the
&s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t powerful ways of
rai&s;ing Compa&s;&s;ion and Terror,
which are the true Tragical Pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>We &s;hall at pre&s;ent treat of the
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions, and how
they are to be rais'd. We have
taken notice above that they are
to be mov'd by Idea's occurring
<PB N="20" REF="65">
in Contemplation, that they are to
be mov'd in a great degree, and
yet ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably. We &s;hall
now &s;hew that the &s;tronge&s;t En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ions, that are ju&s;tly
and rea&s;onably rais'd, mu&s;t be rais'd
by religious Idea's, that is, by Idea's
which either &s;hew the attributes of
the Divinity, or relate to his Wor|&s;hip.
And this we &s;hall endea|vour
to prove, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> by Rea&s;on;
<HI>2ly.</HI> by Authority; <HI>3ly.</HI> by Ex|amples.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We &s;hall endeavour to
prove it by Rea&s;on. Since the fore|&s;aid
Pa&s;&s;ions are to be moved in
a great Degree, and are to be
moved by their Idea's, it follows,
That to be ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably
moved, they mu&s;t be moved by
great Idea's. And therefore the
&s;tronger the Enthu&s;ia&s;m is, the
greater mu&s;t the Idea's be. Now
tho&s;e Idea's are certainly the grea|te&s;t,
which are worthie&s;t to move
the greate&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t Men:
For there the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions
in Poetry are truly admirable, when
<PB N="21" REF="66">
the greater and more violent they
are, the more they &s;how the large|ne&s;s
of Soul, and greatne&s;s of Ca|pacity
of the Writer. For Men
are moved for Two Rea&s;ons, either
becau&s;e they have weak Minds and
Souls, that are capable of being
moved by little Objects, and con|&s;equently
by little and ordinary
Idea's; or becau&s;e they have great|ne&s;s
of Soul and Capacity, to di&s;|cern
and feel the great ones; for
the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions being
caus'd by the Idea's, it follows,
That the more the Soul is capable
of receiving Idea's who&s;e Objects
are truly great and wonderful, the
greater will the Enthu&s;ia&s;m be that
is caus'd by tho&s;e Idea's; From
whence it follows, that the greater
the Soul is, and the larger the Ca|pacity,
the more will it be moved
by religious Idea's; which are not
only great and wonderful, but which
almo&s;t alone are great and won|derful
to a great and wi&s;e Man;
and which never fail to move ve|ry
&s;trongly, unle&s;s it is for want
of due Reflection, or want of Ca|pacity
in the Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="67">
Since therefore the Enthu&s;ia&s;m
in the greater Poetry, is to hold
Proportion with the Idea's, and
tho&s;e Idea's are certainly the great|e&s;t,
which are worthie&s;t to move
the greate&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t Men;
and Divine Idea's or Idea's which
&s;hew the Attributes of God, or re|late
to his Wor&s;hip, are worthie&s;t
to move the greate&s;t and the wi|&s;e&s;t
Men; becau&s;e &s;uch Idea's be|long
to Objects which are only
truly above them, and con&s;equent|ly
truly Admirable, De&s;irable, Joy|ful,
Terrible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it follows, That
the greate&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Enthu&s;i|a&s;m
that can be imploy'd in Poetry,
is only ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably to be
derived from Religious Idea's.</P>
<P>But here we de&s;ire the Reader's
leave to make this Ob&s;ervation,
That &s;ince Religious and Divine
Idea's, or Idea's which shew the
Attributes, or relate to the Wor|&s;hip
of the Divinity, are the wor|thie&s;t
to move the greate&s;t and the
wi&s;e&s;t Men; and the greater and wi&s;er
the Men are, the more they mu&s;t
move and rai&s;e them: As for Ex|ample,
<PB N="23" REF="68">
The greater and more com|prehen&s;ive
the Soul is, which re|flects
upon the Idea of God, the
more that Idea mu&s;t fill that Soul
with Admiration; it follows, That
as great Pa&s;&s;ion, only is the ade|quate
Language of the greater Po|etry;
&s;o the greater Poetry, is on|ly
the adequate Language of Reli|gion;
and that therefore the great|e&s;t
Pa&s;&s;ion, is the Language of that
&s;ort of Poetry; becau&s;e that &s;ort
of Poetry is the worthie&s;t Language
of Religion.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> We &s;hall proceed
to prove by Authority, That the
&s;tronge&s;t Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions in
Poetry, are only ju&s;tly and rea&s;on|ably
to be rais'd by Religious I|dea's:
And this we &s;hall &s;how by
the Authority of the greate&s;t Cri|ticks
among the Antients, <HI>Ari&s;totle,
Hermogenes,</HI> and <HI>Longinus.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, in the third
Book of his Rhetorick, <HI>Cap.</HI> II. and
III. That the frequent u&s;e of Me|taphors,
Dialects, Epithets, is a
great deal fitter for Poetry than it
<PB N="24" REF="69">
is for Pro&s;e, becau&s;e they are the
Language of Pa&s;&s;ion, and Poetry
is more Pa&s;&s;ionate or more Enthu|&s;ia&s;tick
than Pro&s;e, for this Rea&s;on,
becau&s;e the Per&s;ons and the Things
of which Poetry treats, are many
degrees above tho&s;e which are the
Subjects of Pro&s;e. Now all the
World knows that the Graecians,
treated of the greate&s;t Human Per|&s;ons
and Things in their Pro&s;e, but
that Poetry was a Language which
they re&s;erv'd for their Gods, and for
the Things which related to them.
And I am apt to believe, that Po|etry
from hence was called, the
Language of the Gods, becau&s;e when
ever the Graecians in the Poetical
times, introduc'd their God's Speak|ing,
they were &s;ure to &s;peak in
Ver&s;e. But</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> in the VI.
Chapter of the Fir&s;t Book of his
Treati&s;e, concerning the Forms of
Speech, tells us, That there are
Four kind of Thoughts or Idea's,
or Conceptions, which were proper
to give that elevation and gravity
to a Di&s;cour&s;e, which by their uni|on
<PB N="25" REF="70">
compo&s;e that quality in Wri|ting
which we call Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>1. The Fir&s;t and Principal of them
are, all &s;uch Thoughts or Idea's of
God, as are worthy of the Divi|nity,
not like &s;ome of the Home|rical
Conceptions of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which
&s;ays <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> being more Hu|man
than Divine, and unworthy of
the Divinity, are contrary to true
Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>2. Next to the&s;e the Concep|tions
which give Elevation and
Gravity, and con&s;equently Maje&s;ty
to a Di&s;cour&s;e, are &s;uch Thoughts
or Idea's concerning the Works of
God, as are worthy the Divine
Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>3. The Third &s;ort of Conceptions
are, of &s;uch Things as are indeed
them&s;elves Divine, but they are
&s;uch Emanations of Divinity, as
are to be &s;een in Men, as Ju&s;tice,
Temperance, Fortitude, Nature,
Law and the like, to which may
be added, Number, Power and
Might.</P>
<P>4. The Fourth &s;ort are, of Things
that indeed are Human, but are
<PB N="26" REF="71">
reputed Great and Illu&s;trious, as,
Conque&s;t, Riches, Nobility, Place,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But here I de&s;ire the Reader
to ob&s;erve, That <HI>Hermogenes</HI> is here
&s;peaking concerning Peices of Elo|quence,
and &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es as are
writ in Pro&s;e; for it is certain,
that the&s;e la&s;t Idea's as they are
of Things that are meerly Human,
can never afford the greate&s;t Spirit
that can be imploy'd in Poetry.
For as the Objects them&s;elves are
not truly great, becau&s;e, as <HI>Longinuus</HI>
&s;ays, A Man who has it in his
Power to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, &s;hows him|&s;elf
Great by contemning them:
It is impo&s;&s;ible that a Spirit that is
very great, can flow from the&s;e
Idea's, becau&s;e the Spirit that is
very great, mu&s;t hold proportion
with its Idea's, as the Idea's mu&s;t
with their Objects; and therefore
the&s;e Idea's cannot be great, becau&s;e
their Objects are not great. We
ought now in the <HI>Third</HI> Place, to
proceed to the Authority of <HI>Longi|nus.</HI>
But that we may Diver&s;ifie
this Treati&s;e the more, and make
it the more entertaining, we &s;hall
<PB N="27" REF="72">
fir&s;t &s;hew Examples of the &s;everal
kinds of the foremention'd Thoughts,
producing that &s;ort of Spirit in Po|etry
which we call Enthu&s;ia&s;tick
Admiration, and that we may &s;how
the Reader more plainly how that
Spirit is produc'd, we &s;hall &s;et be|fore
him as near as we can, &s;uch
kind of Thoughts as in&s;pire the
Soul with Admiration alone, un|complicated
with Terror, or any
other Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts, or Idea's, which
produce that Enthu&s;ia&s;m which we
call Admiration, are Thoughts or
Idea's which hold &s;ome proportion
with &s;uch Objects, as in their Na|ture
are truly admirable. Tho&s;e
Thoughts or Idea's are of Two
&s;orts, Idea's of Sounds, and Idea's
of Things. We &s;hall then have
occa&s;ion to treat of Idea's of Sounds,
when we come to &s;peak of Ter|rour,
and &s;ome of the other En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ions; we &s;hall at
pre&s;ent treat of &s;uch Idea's of
Things,, as are proper to excite
Admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="73">
We have &s;hown that <HI>Hermoge|nes</HI>
in the fir&s;t Rank of the&s;e,
reckons tho&s;e Thoughts and Idea's
of God, that are worthy of the
Creator: Such is the Invocation of
<HI>Milton,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Para|di&s;e
Lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<Q><L>And chiefly Thou, O Spirit! that do&s;t prefer</L>
<L>Before all Temples, th' upright Heart and pure,</L>

<L>Dove-like Sat'&s;t brooding on the va&s;t Aby&s;s:</L>
<L>And mad'&s;t it pregnant what in me is Dark,</L>
<L>Illumin, what is Low rai&s;e and &s;upport,</L>
<L>That to the Height of this great Argument</L>
<L>I may a&s;&s;ert, Eternal Providence;</L>

<P>And that it was the&s;e Divine

it with Admiration, and with a
noble Greatne&s;s, which Pa&s;&s;ion ex|pre&s;t,
makes the greatne&s;s of the
<PB N="29" REF="74">
Spirit, the Reader who goes back
to the beginning of the Poem, will
find no manner of room to doubt.
For <HI>Milton,</HI> like a Ma&s;ter, begins
with a gentle Spirit, which he con|tinues
for the Twelve fir&s;t Lines:
In the Thirteenth where he &s;peaks
of the boldne&s;s of his Attempt, he
begins to ri&s;e; and in the Nineteenth,
where he talks of the Power of the
Holy Gho&s;t, he is quite upon the
Wing.</P>
<Q><L>In&s;truct me, for Thou know'&s;t, Thou from the fir&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>And &s;uch are the Thoughts con|cerning
God, which are &s;pread thro'
that Divine Dialogue, between God
and <HI>Adam,</HI> in the Eighth Book of
the &s;ame Poem; I believe the
Reader, will pardon the length if
I repeat it, which I am very much
inclin'd to do, not only becau&s;e I
challenge the mo&s;t zealous admirers
of Antiquity, to produce any thing
like it, from among all the Dia|logues
in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> that are
between either a God or a Man, or
between one God and another:
<PB N="30" REF="75">
But becau&s;e the Reader who &s;ees
the inequalities in it, will ea&s;ily
&s;ee that it derives its greatne&s;s and
its &s;ublimity, from the becoming
Thoughts which it has of the Dei|ty.
That the Reader may through|ly
under&s;tand it, without turning
to the Book, the occa&s;ion of it is
this. <HI>Adam,</HI> relating the Hi&s;tory
of the Creation to the Angel <HI>Ra|phael,</HI>
tells him, how after he had
given Names to the Birds and the
Bea&s;ts, which God had brought
before him for that purpo&s;e; he
who under&s;tood their Natures, and
&s;aw none of them was fit for his
Conver&s;ation, de&s;ir'd of God in the
following Words, a Partner fit for
Humane Society.</P>
<Q><L>O by what Name, for Thou above all the&s;e,</L>
<L>Above Mankind, or ought than Mankind higher</L>
<L>Surpa&s;&s;e&s;t far my Naming, how may I</L>

<L>Thus I pre&s;umptuous; And the Vi&s;ion bright</L>
<L>As with a Smile more brightned, thus reply'd.</L></Q>
<P>Here by the way, I de&s;ire the
Reader to ob&s;erve, how the Spirit
of the Poem &s;inks, when <HI>Adam</HI>
comes from God, to him&s;elf; and
how it ri&s;es again, when he returns
to his Creator: But let us proceed

needle&s;s, for what has been
&s;aid, may &s;uffice to &s;how that a Poet
who intends: to give that Elevation,
and that Gravity to his Poem;
which Compo&s;e Maje&s;ty can fetch
his Ideas from no Object &s;o proper
as from God. For as great Elevation
mu&s;t be produced by a great Admi|ration,
as every Pa&s;&s;ion which the
Poet excites, ought to be ju&s;t and
Rea&s;onable, and Adapted to its Ob|ject,
it is impo&s;&s;ible that any one,
who is not &s;tupid, can &s;eriou&s;ly con|template
his Maker, but that his
Soul mu&s;t be exalted and lifted up
towards its Primitive Objects, and be
fill'd and in&s;pired with the highe&s;t
Admiration. For 'tis then that the
Enthu&s;ia&s;m in Poetry is Wonderful
and Divine, when it &s;hows the Ex|cellence
of the Authors di&s;cernment,
and the largene&s;s of his Soul; now
all the Ideas of God are &s;uch, that
the more large and comprehen&s;ive
the Soul of a Poet is; and the more

Poetry ought to be proportioned to
the Ideas, and the Ideas to the Ob|ject,

in Poetry there is a great Spirit
which is derived from Ideas, who&s;e
Objects are unworthy to move the
Soul of a great and a wise Man,
there that Spirit is either fal&s;e

<P>I could here bring Examples of
the &s;ame kind of Spirit, derived in
due Proportion from Ideas of Sub|lunary
Things, as of the Four Ele|ments
Water, Earth, Air, Fire,
Winds and Meteors of all &s;orts,
Seas, Rivers, Mountains, but I am
afraid of running into Length, and
heaping too many Citations one
upon another. Be&s;ides it will be
very convenient to make two or
three Remarks here.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="98">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Wonders of the
Univer&s;e, afford the more admira|ble
Ideas and a more admirable
Spirit, the more they &s;hew the
attributes of the Creator or relate
to his Wor&s;hip. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
Na ural Philo&s;ophy is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to a Poet, not only that
he may adorn his Poem, with the
u&s;eful knowledge it affords, but
becau&s;e the more he knows the
immen&s;e Phaenomena of the Uni|ver&s;e,
the more he will be &s;ure to
admire them. For the more we
know of Things that are never to
be comprehended by us, the more
that knowledge mu&s;t make them
appear wonderful. The <HI>Third</HI> Re|mark
that I &s;hall make is this,
That they to whom Nature has
given that happy Elevation of
Thought, which alone can make
a great Poet, will often be di|rected
by that tendency to great|ne&s;s,
which they have within them
to Ideas, from which they may
derive a lofty Spirit, yet I &s;hall
&s;hew by the Example of <HI>Milton,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="99">
that they may often very gro&s;ly
fail, for want of a certain know|ledge
of the Objects from which
they are to draw their Idea's, for
'tis for want of that knowledge
that <HI>Milton</HI> has done the mo&s;t un|artful
thing that perhaps ever was
done, in the two or three la&s;t Books
of the greate&s;t Poem that ever was
written by Man. For whereas in
the Fir&s;t Eight Books, he had by
the Mouth of God or Angels, or of
Man the Companion of Angels,
divinely entertain'd us with the
wondrous Works of God, in the
latter end of his Poem, and more
particularly in the la&s;t Book, he
makes an Angel entertain us with
the Works of corrupted Man, from
which it is very plain by what
has been deliver'd above, concern|ing
the Nature of Enthu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ion; that that Angel could draw
no &s;ort of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and lea&s;t of
all that of Admiration and Terror,
which give the principal Greatne&s;s
and Elevation to, Poetry. For how
flat, how low and unmu&s;ical is the Re|lation
of the Actions of fall'n Man, in
<PB N="55" REF="100">
the 10th. <HI>Lib.</HI> tho' deliver'd by the
voice of Divinity.</P>
<Q><L>On <HI>Adam,</HI> La&s;t thus judgment He pronounc'd,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hearkned to the Voice of thy Wife,</L>
<L>And eaten of the Tree, concerning which</L>
<L>I charg'd thee, &s;aying, Thou &s;halt not eat thereof,</L>
<L>Curs'd is the Ground for thy &s;ake, thou in &s;orrow</L>
<L>Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy Life:</L>
<L>Thorns al&s;o, and Thi&s;tles it &s;hall bring thee forth</L>
<L>Untill'd, and thou &s;halt eat the Herb of the Field:</L>
<L>In the &s;weat of thy Face &s;halt thou eat Bread,</L>
<L>Till thou return unto the Ground, for thou</L>

<P>The Late Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> with a
great deal of Inju&s;tice, us'd to at|tribute

getting into a tract of Scripture, as
he was pleas'd to expre&s;s him&s;elf:
Whereas the thing that made him
<PB N="56" REF="101">
&s;ink, was plainly the poorne&s;s and
lowne&s;s of the Ideas. For how
could the Works of corrupted Man,
afford any other to God or Angels?
But what lofty what glorious Ideas
does a religious mention of the
Works of God, afford to Man in
his primitive State in that in|comparable
Hymn in the Fifth
Book of the &s;ame Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t:

it, no nor Second to it can ever be

<P>'Tis ea&s;ie to di&s;cern here, with
how much more Divinity <HI>Milton</HI>
makes a Man &s;peak concerning the
Works of God, than he makes even
the Creator Him&s;elf &s;peak concern|ing
the Works of Man. But here
if the Reader will pardon a Digre&s;|&s;ion,
I &s;hall make an Ob&s;ervation
which may not be di&s;agreeable to
<PB N="60" REF="105">
him. The Ob&s;ervation is this, That
all the Pa&s;&s;ages in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,
where God is introduc'd Speaking,
are flat to the re&s;erve of tho&s;e in
which he &s;peaks of him&s;elf. Upon
enquiring into the Rea&s;on of it, I
found, That according to the Ac|count
which I have given of Poeti|cal
Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or of the Spirit of
Poetry, it is nothing but that Ad|miration
and Terrour, and the re&s;t
of tho&s;e Enthu&s;ia&s;tical Pa&s;&s;ions which
are produced by their proper Ideas,
and which are to hold Proportion
with their Ideas, as their Ideas, mu&s;t
with their Objects. Now nothing
is more impo&s;&s;ible than that God
&s;hould either Fear or Admire His
own Creatures. But where <HI>Milton</HI>
makes him &s;peak concerning Him|&s;elf,
or His Infinite Power, there
he makes him &s;peak with a great
Spirit, as in that Pa&s;&s;age of the
Sixth Book where He &s;peaks to
His Son.</P>
<Q><L>Go then thou mightie&s;t in thy Father's Might</L>
<L>A&s;cend My Chariot, guide the rapid Wheels,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="106">
That &s;hake Heaven's Ba&s;is, bring forth all my War,</L>
<L>My Bow and Thunder, My Almighty Arms.</L></Q>
<P>'Tis plain that here the Poet is
guilty of a Mi&s;take, but indeed a
Mi&s;take that is almo&s;t unavoida|ble,
for 'tis the Admiration and
Terrour that make the Spirit in
the preceding Ver&s;es; and it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to conceive the Ideas with|out
feeling the Pa&s;&s;ions; &s;o that
<HI>Milton</HI> while he was rapt with
Admiration and moved with Ter|rour
by the Ideas which he had
conceiv'd, &s;hifts Per&s;ons in&s;en&s;ibly,
and forgetting who &s;peaks, expre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf with tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which
indeed are proper enough in the
Poet, but never can be &s;o in the
Deity. For neither His Bow, nor
His Almighty Arms, His Thunder,
nor the rapid Wheels that Shake
Heavens ba&s;is, can be in the lea&s;t
Admirable or Terrible to the Divi|nity,
&s;o that Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> is certain|ly,
in the right in his Notes upon
his <HI>Davideis,</HI> where he tells us, that
<PB N="62" REF="107">
God is to be introduc'd &s;peaking
&s;imply. And this puts me in mind
of an extraordinary Argument of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa&s;chal,</HI> proving the Di|vinity
of our Saviour by the &s;impli|city
of his Stile; for &s;ays he, our
Saviour &s;peaks of the &s;ublime&s;t Sub|jects,
even the glories of the King|dom
of Heaven without being
moved at all, which &s;hews that
he was really God; for &s;uppo&s;e a
Pea&s;ant, &s;ays he, or an ordinary
Man &s;hou'd be carried to the
Court of &s;ome Prince, as for Ex|ample
the great Mogul, and there
be &s;hewn all his Riches, his Pomp
and his Power; this Pea&s;ant at his
return would certainly &s;peak of
the&s;e Things in extravagant terms,
in terms that would &s;ufficiently
declare his tran&s;port. But if the
Mogul him&s;elf was to &s;peak of them,
he who had been always us;d to
them, would &s;peak without any
emotion. So &s;ays Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa&s;chal,</HI>
if any one el&s;e had deliver'd any
Thing concerning the glories of the
Kingdom of Heaven, he would cer|tainly
have done it with tran&s;port,
<PB N="63" REF="108">
nay tho' he had been a Fanatick
or an Impo&s;tor; For let tho&s;e Di|vine
Ideas come how they will,
'tis Impo&s;&s;ible for Man to think of
them without being Ravi&s;h'd by
them. But our Saviour who was
God, and who con&s;equently had

<P>But let us come to the <HI>Third</HI>
sort of Thoughts, which <HI>Hermogenes</HI>
&s;ays, are proper to give Elevation
and Gravity to a Di&s;cour&s;e, and
tho&s;e are Things which indeed are
Divine, &s;ays, but are often beheld
in Men. The&s;e Emanations of
Divinity are the Virtues &s;uch as
Temperance, Ju&s;tice, Fortitude,
Magnanimity; or Nature, Law,
Power and the like. And we
&s;hou'd never make an end, if we
&s;hou'd give Examples of all the
Pa&s;&s;ages, who&s;e greatne&s;s of Spirit,
is deriv'd from the&s;e Ideas. But
for the Readers Entertainment we

Temperance, gives noble Ideas and
con&s;equently a noble Spirit, as we
may &s;ee by the Second Ode, of the
Second Book of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>

too a noble Spirit, as we may &s;ee in

<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> sort of Thoughts
which <HI>Hermogenes</HI> mentions, as Ri|ches,
Nobility, Place, Office, Rank,
and the like, we &s;hall purpo&s;ely
pa&s;s by, without giving Examples
of them, becau&s;e we &s;hall have
a particular occa&s;ion to do it here|after.
Let us now pa&s;s to the next
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ion which is Ter|rour;
than which if it is rightly
manag'd, none is more capable of
giving a great Spirit to Poetry.
This Pa&s;&s;ion &s;carce ever goes by it|&s;elf,
<PB N="69" REF="114">
but is always more or le&s;s
complicated with Admiration. For
every thing that is Terrible is great
at lea&s;t to him to whom it is Ter|rible.
'Tis now our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew
two Things. Fir&s;t, what this En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Terrour is? and Second|ly,
from what Ideas it is chiefly to
be deriv'd.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t let us &s;how what this &s;ort of
Enthu&s;ia&s;m is, and in order to that,
let us &s;hew as briefly as we can,
what the Common Pa&s;&s;ion is
which we call Terror. Fear then
or Terror is, a Di&s;turbance of Mind
proceeding from the apprehen&s;ion
of an approaching evil; Threatning
Di&s;truction or very great trouble
either to us or ours. And when
the di&s;turbance comes &s;uddenly
with &s;urpri&s;e, let us call it Terror,
when gradually Fear. Things then
that are powerful, and likely to
hurt, are the cau&s;es of Common
Terror, and the more they are
powerful and likely to hurt, the
more they become the cau&s;es of
Terror, which Terror, the greater
it is, the more it is join'd with
<PB N="70" REF="115">
wonder, and the nearer it comes
to a&s;toni&s;hment. Thus we have
&s;hewn what Objects of the Mind
are the cau&s;es of Common Terror,
and the Ideas of tho&s;e Objects are
the cau&s;es of Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terror.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;hew from what
Ideas this Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terror is
chiefly to be deriv'd. The greate&s;t
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terrour then mu&s;t
needs be deriv'd from Religious
Idea's, for &s;ince the more their Ob|jects
are Powerful, and likely to
hurt, the greater Terrour their
Idea's produce: What can pro|duce
a greater Terrour than the
Idea of an Angry God? Which puts
me in mind of that admirable Pa&s;|&s;age
of <HI>Homer,</HI> about the Fight of
the Gods, in the Twentieth of the
Iliads, cited by <HI>Longinus</HI> in his
Chapter of the Loftine&s;s of the

<P>I now come to the Precepts of
<HI>Longinus,</HI> and pretend to &s;hew from
them, that the greate&s;t &s;ublimity is
to be deriv'd from Religious Ideas.
But why then, &s;ays the Reader, has
not <HI>Longinus</HI> plainly told us &s;o? He
was not ignorant, that he ought to
make his &s;ubject as plain as he
could. For he has told us in the
beginning of his Treati&s;e, that every
one who gives In&s;truction concer|ning
<PB N="77" REF="122">
an Art, ought to endeavour
two things. The fir&s;t is to make
his Reader clearly under&s;tand what
that is which he pretends to teach.
The &s;econd is to &s;hew him how it
may be attain'd. And he blames
<HI>Cecilius</HI> very &s;everely for neglect|ing
the La&s;t, how then &s;ays the
Objector comes he him&s;elf to have
taken no care of the Fir&s;t: Is it
becau&s;e <HI>Cecilius</HI> had done it before
him? If &s;o, it was a very great
fault in <HI>Longinus,</HI> to publi&s;h a Book
which cou'd not be under&s;tood but
by another Man's Writings; e&s;pe|cially
when he &s;aw that tho&s;e Wri|tings
were &s;o very defective that
they would not probably la&s;t. But
what, continues the Objector, if
<HI>Cecilius</HI> had not done it before
him? For <HI>Longinus</HI> tells us that
<HI>Cecilius</HI> makes u&s;e of a multitude
of Words to &s;hew what it is;
now he who knows any thing clear|ly
may in a few Words explain it
clearly to others; and he who does
not will make it ob&s;cure by many.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that tho' <HI>Lon|ginus</HI>
did by long Study, and habi|tude
<PB N="78" REF="123">
know the Sublime when he
&s;aw it, as well as any Man, yet
he had not &s;o clear a knowledge of
the Nature of it as to explain it
clearly to others. For if he had
done that, as the Objector &s;ays,
he would have defin'd it, but he
has been &s;o far from defining it,
that in one place he has given an
account of it that is contrary to
the true nature of it. For he tells
us in that Chapter which treats
of the Fountains of Sublimity, that
Loftine&s;s is often without any Pa&s;|&s;ion
at all. Which is contrary to
to the true nature of it. The &s;ublime
is indeed often without Common Pa&s;|&s;ion,
as ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion is often with|out
that. But then it is never with|out
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ion. For the
Sublime is nothing el&s;e but a great
Thought, or Great Thoughts mo|ving
the Soul from it's Ordinary
Scituation by the Enthu&s;ia&s;m which
naturally attends them. Now <HI>Lon|ginus</HI>
had a notion of Enthu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ion; for he e&s;tabli&s;hes it in that,
very Chapter for the &s;econd Source
of Sublimity. Now <HI>Longinus</HI> by
<PB N="79" REF="124">
affirming that the Sublime may be
without not only that, but ordina|ry
Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ays a thing that is not
only contrary to the true Nature
of it, but contradictory of Him&s;elf.
For he tells us in the beginning of
the Treati&s;e that the Sublime does
not &s;o properly per&s;uade us, as it Ra|vi&s;hes
and Tran&s;ports us, and pro|duces
in us a certain Admiration
mingled with a&s;toni&s;hment and
with &s;urpri&s;e, which is quite ano|ther
thing than the barely Plea&s;ing
or the barely per&s;wading; that it
gives a noble Vigour to a Di&s;cour&s;e,
an invincible force which commits a
plea&s;ing Rape upon the very Soul
of the Reader; that whenever it
breaks out where it ought to do,
like the Artillery of <HI>Jove,</HI> it Thun|ders
blazes and &s;trikes at once,
and &s;hews all the united force of a
Writer. Now I leave the Reader to
Judge, whether <HI>Longinius</HI> has not
been &s;aying here all along that Subli|mity
is never without Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the foremention'd Di&s;ini|tion
is ju&s;t and good, I have rea&s;on
to believe, becau&s;e it takes in all
<PB N="80" REF="125">
the &s;ources of Sublimity which <HI>Lon|ginus</HI>
has e&s;tabli&s;h'd. For fir&s;t
greatne&s;s of Thought &s;uppo&s;es Ele|vation,
they, being Synonimous
Terms: And &s;econdly the Enthu&s;i|a&s;m
or the Pathetique, as <HI>Longinus</HI>
calls it, follows of cour&s;e; for if a
Man is not &s;trongly mov'd by great
Thoughts, he does not &s;ufficiently
and effectually conceive them. And
thirdly the Figurative-Language is
but a con&s;equence of the Enthu&s;ia&s;m,
that being the natural Language of
the Pa&s;&s;ions. And &s;o is fourthly the
noblene&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uppo|&s;ing
a Man to be Ma&s;ter of the
Language in which he Writes.
For as the Thoughts produce the
Spirit or the Pa&s;&s;ion, the Spirit
produces and makes the Expre&s;&s;ion,
which is known by experience to
all who are Poets; for never any
one, while he was rapt with Enthu|&s;ia&s;m
or Ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and is
&s;elf evident to all who con&s;ider
that the expre&s;&s;ion conveys and
&s;hows the Spirit, and con&s;equent|ly
mu&s;t be produc'd by it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="126">
Thus the definition which we
have laid down, being according
to <HI>Longinus</HI> his own Doctrine, the
true definition of the Sublime, and
&s;hewing clearly the thing which he
has not done, nor given any defini|tion
at all of it, it &s;eems plain to
me, that he had no clear and di|&s;tinct
Idea of it; and con&s;equently
Religion might be the thing from
which it is chiefly to be deriv'd
and he but ob&s;curely know it;
but that Religion is that thing
from which the Sublime is chiefly
to be deriv'd, let us &s;hew by the
Marks which he has given of the
latter; which will further &s;trengthen
our Definition. Fir&s;t, &s;ays he, that
which is truely &s;ublime has this pe|culiar
to it, that it exalts the
Soul and makes it conceive a grea|ter
Idea of it &s;elf; filling it with
Joy, and with a certain noble Pride,
as if it &s;elf had produc'd what it but
barely Reads.</P>
<P>Now here it is plain, that the
highe&s;t Ideas mu&s;t mo&s;t exalt the
<PB N="82" REF="127">
Soul, but Religious Ideas are the
highe&s;t.</P>
<P>The more the Soul is mov'd by
the greate&s;t Ideas, the more it
conceives them, but the more it
conceives of the greate&s;t Ideas, the
greater Opinion it mu&s;t have of its
own Capacity. By con&s;equence the
more it is mov'd by the Wonders of
Religion the more it values it &s;elf
upon its own Excellences. Again,
The more the Soul &s;ees its Excel|lence
the more it Rejoyces. Be&s;ides
Religious Ideas are the mo&s;t Ad|mirable,
and what is mo&s;t Admi|rable
according to the Doctrine of
<HI>Ari&s;trotle</HI> is mo&s;t delightful. Be&s;ides
Religious Ideas create Pa&s;&s;ion in
&s;uch a manner as to turn and in|cline
the Soul to its primitive Ob|ject.
So that Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ion
are of the &s;ame &s;ide, and this Peace
between the Faculties cau&s;es the
Soul to Rejoyce, of which we
&s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more
anon.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="128">
2. The Second Mark that <HI>Lon|ginus</HI>
gives of the Sublime, is when
a Di&s;cour&s;e leaves a great deal for
us to think. But now this is cer|tain
that the wonders of Religion
are never to be exhau&s;ted, for they
are always new, and the more you
enter into them, the more they are
&s;ure to &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>3. The Third Mark is, when it
leaves in the Reader an Idea above
its Expre&s;&s;ion. Now no Expre&s;&s;i|ons
can come up to the Ideas
which we draw from the Atri|butes
of God, or from His won|drous
Works, which only the Au|thour
of them can comprehend.</P>
<P>4. The Fourth Mark is, when it
makes an impre&s;&s;ion upon us, which
it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>God who made Man for Him|&s;elf,
and for his own Glory, and
who requires chiefly his Heart; mu&s;t
by con&s;equence have form'd him
of &s;uch a Nature as to be mo&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="129">
&s;trongly mov'd with Religious Ide|as
if once he enters into them.
So that the Impre&s;&s;ions which they
make are Impo&s;&s;ible to be Re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>5. The Fifth Mark is when the
Impre&s;&s;ion la&s;ts and is difficult to
be defac'd. Now that the Im|pre&s;&s;ions
which Religion makes up|on
us are difficult to be defac'd is
plain from this, that they who
think it their Intere&s;t to deface
them can never bring it about.</P>
<P>6. The Sixth Mark is when it
plea&s;es univer&s;ally, people of diffe|rent
Humours, Inclinations, Sexes,
Ages, Times, Climates. Now there
is nothing &s;o agreeable to the Soul
or that makes &s;o univer&s;al an Im|pre&s;&s;ion
as the wonders of Religion.
Some Per&s;ons are mov'd by Love
and are not touch'd by Ambition,
others are animated by Ambition
and only Laugh at Love. Some
are pleas'd with a brave Revenge,
others with a generous Contempt of
Injuries, but the Eternal Power and
<PB N="85" REF="130">
the Infinite knowledge of God, the
Wonders of the Creation, and the
beautiful brightne&s;s of Virtue make
a powerful impre&s;&s;ion on all.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have wonder'd
very much upon Reflection, how it
could happen that &s;o great a Man
as <HI>Longinus,</HI> who whenever he met
a pa&s;&s;age in any Di&s;cour&s;e that
was lofty enough to plea&s;e him,
had di&s;cernment enough to &s;ee that
it had &s;ome of the preceeding Marks,
&s;hould mi&s;s of finding &s;o ea&s;ie a
thing as this, that never any pa&s;&s;age
had all the&s;e Marks or &s;o much as
the Majority of them, unle&s;s it
were Religious.</P>
<P>But to return to Terrour, we
may plainly &s;ee by the foregoing
Precepts and Examples of <HI>Longinus,</HI>
that this Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terror con|tributes
extreamly to the Sublime,
and Secondly that it is mo&s;t pro|duced
by Religious Ideas.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t Ideas producing Terrour
contribute extreamly to the Sublime.
All the Examples that <HI>Longinus</HI>
brings of the loftine&s;s of the
<PB N="86" REF="131">
Thought, con&s;i&s;t of terrible Ideas.
And they are Principally &s;uch Ideas
that work the effects, which he
takes notice of, in the beginning of
his Treati&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that Ravi&s;h and
Tran&s;port the Reader, and produce
a certain Admiration mingled with
A&s;toni&s;hment and with Surprize.
For the Ideas which produce Ter|rour
are nece&s;&s;arily accompanied
with Admiration, becau&s;e ev'ry
thing that is terrible is great to Him
to whom it is Terrible; and with
Surprize without which Terrour
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and with A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
becau&s;e ev'ry thing which is
very Terrible is Wonderful and
A&s;toni&s;hing; and as Terrour is
perhaps the violent'&s;t of all the Pa&s;&s;i|ons,
it con&s;equently makes an im|pre&s;&s;ion
which we cannot re&s;i&s;t, and
which is hardly to be defac'd, and
no Pa&s;&s;ion is attended with greater
Joy than Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Terrour,
which proceeds from our reflecting
that we are out of Danger at the
very time that we &s;ee it before us.
And as Terrour is one of the vio|lente&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="132">
lente&s;t of all Pa&s;&s;ions if it is very
great, and the harde&s;t to be re|&s;i&s;ted,
nothing gives more force, nor
more vehemence to a Di&s;cour&s;e.
But Secondly, it is plain from the
&s;ame <HI>Longinus,</HI> that this Enthu&s;ia|&s;tick
Terrour is chiefly to be de|riv'd
from Religious Ideas. For
all the Examples which he has
brought of the Sublime, in his
Chapter of the Sublimity of the
Thoughts con&s;i&s;ts of mo&s;t Terrible
and mo&s;t Religious Ideas, and at
the &s;ame time ev'ry Man's Rea&s;on
will inform him, that ev'ry thing
that is Terrible in Religion is the
mo&s;t Terrible thing in the World.</P>
<P>But that we may &s;et this in a
clearer Light, let us lay before the
Reader the &s;everal Ideas which
are capable of producing this En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Terrour, which &s;eem to
me to be tho&s;e which follow, <HI>viz.</HI>
Gods, Daemons, Hell, Spirits and
Souls of Men, Miracles, Prodigies,
Enchantments, Witchcrafts, Thun|der,
Tempe&s;ts, raging Seas, Inun|dations,
Torrents, Earthquakes,
<PB N="88" REF="133">
Volcanos, Mon&s;ters, Serpents, Li|ons,
Tygres, Fire, War, Pe&s;tilence,
Famine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now of all the&s;e Ideas none are
&s;o terrible as tho&s;e which &s;hew
the Wrath and Vengeance of an
Angry God. For nothing is &s;o
wonderful in its effects, and con&s;e|quently
the Images or Ideas of tho&s;e
effects mu&s;t carry a great deal of
Terrour with them, which we
may &s;ee was <HI>Longinus</HI> his Opinion
by the Examples which he brings
in his Chapter of the Sublimity of
the Thoughts. Now of things which
are terrible tho&s;e are the mo&s;t terrible
which are the mo&s;t wonderful, be|cau&s;e
that &s;eeing them both threat|ning
and powerful, and not being
able to fathom the greatne&s;s and
extent of their Power, we know
not how far and how &s;oon they
may hurt us.</P>
<P>But further nothing is &s;o terri|ble
as the wrath of infinite Power,
becau&s;e nothing is &s;o unavoidable
as the Vengeance de&s;ign'd by it.
There is no flying nor lying hid
<PB N="89" REF="134">
from the great univer&s;al Monarch.
He may deliver us from all other
Terrours, but nothing can &s;ave
and defend us from him. And
therefore Rea&s;on which &s;erves to
di&s;&s;ipate our Terrours in &s;ome other
Dangers, &s;erves but to augment
them when we are threatned by
Infinite Power; and that Fortitude
which may be Heroick at other
times is down right madne&s;s then.</P>
<P>For the other Ideas which we
mention'd above, they will be
found to be more terrible as they
have more of Religion in them.
But we &s;hall have &s;o many nece&s;|&s;ary
occa&s;ions of giving Examples
of them, in the Sequel of this
Treati&s;e, that it will be altogether
needle&s;s to do it now. But here it
will be convenient to An&s;wer an
Objection. For how come &s;ome
of the foremention'd Ideas which
&s;eem to have but little to do with
Religion, to be Terrible to great
and to wi&s;e Men, as it is plain that
&s;uch when they read the De&s;crip|tions
of them in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>
are terrify'd.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="135">
To which we An&s;wer, that the
care which Nature has inrooted in
all of their own Pre&s;ervation, is the
Cau&s;e that Men are unavoidably
terrify'd, with any thing that
threatens approaching evil. 'Tis
now our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew how
the Ideas of Serpents, Lions, Ty|gers,
&amp;c. were made by the art
of tho&s;e great Poets, to be terri|ble
to their Readers at the &s;ame
time that we are &s;ecure from their
Objects.</P>
<P>'Tis very plain that it is the
Apprehen&s;ion of Danger which
cau&s;es that emotion in us which
we call Terrour, and it &s;ignifies
nothing at all to the purpo&s;e whe|ther
the Danger is real or imagi|nary;
and 'tis as plain too, that
the Soul never takes the Alarm
from any thing &s;o &s;oon as it does
from the Sen&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e two
noble ones of the Eye and the Ear,
by rea&s;on of the &s;trict a&s;&s;inity
which they have with the Imagi|nation;
and the Evil always &s;eems
<PB N="91" REF="136">
to be very near, when tho&s;e two
Sen&s;es give notice of it; and the
nearer the Evil is the greater
&s;till is the Terror. But now let
us &s;ee how tho&s;e two Poets, did
by Virtue of their Ideas, bring even
ab&s;ent, Terrible Objects, within the
reach of tho&s;e two noble Sen&s;es.
Fir&s;t then to bring an ab&s;ent Ter|rible
Object before our Sight, they
drew an Image or Picture of it;
but to draw an Image or Picture
of a Terrible Object, &s;o as to
&s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;h the Soul by
the Eye, they never fail'd to draw
it in violent Action or Motion;
and in Order to that they made
choice of Words and Numbers,
which might be&s;t expre&s;s the violence
of that Action or Motion. For an ab|&s;ent
Object can never be &s;et before
the Eye in a true Light, unle&s;s it
is &s;hewn in violent Action or Motion.
Becau&s;e unle&s;s it is &s;hewn &s;o, the
Soul has lei&s;ure to reflect upon the
Deceit. But violent Motion can
never be conceived without a vio|lent
agitation of Spirit, and that
<PB N="92" REF="137">
&s;udden agitation &s;urpti&s;es the Soul
and gives it le&s;s time to Reflect;
and at the &s;ame time cau&s;es the
Impre&s;&s;ions that the Objects make
to be &s;o Deep, and their traces to
be &s;o profound, that it makes them
in a manner as pre&s;ent to us as if
they were really before us. For
the Spirits being &s;et in a violent
emotion, and the Imagination being
fir'd by that agitation; and the
Brain being deeply penetrated by
tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, the very Objects
them&s;elves are &s;et as it were be|fore
us, and con&s;equently we are
&s;en&s;ible of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion that
we &s;hould feel from the things
them&s;elves. For the warmer the
Imagination is, the le&s;s able we
are to Reflect, and con&s;equently
the things are the more pre&s;ent
to us of which we draw the Ima|ges;
and therefore when the Ima|gination
is &s;o inflam'd as to ren|der
the Soul utterly incapable of
reflecting there is no difference be|tween
the Images and the things
them&s;elves; as we may &s;ee for ex|ample
<PB N="93" REF="138">
by Men in Raging Feavours.
But tho&s;e two great Poets were not
&s;atisfied with &s;etting ab&s;ent Objects
before our Eyes, by &s;hewing them
in violent motion; but if their mo|tion
occa&s;ion'd any Extraordinary
Sounds that were terrifying; they
&s;o contriv'd their Numbers and
Expre&s;&s;ions, as that they might be
&s;ure to ring tho&s;e &s;ounds in the
very Ears of their Readers.</P>
<P>We ought now to treat of the
other Enthu&s;ia&s;tic Pa&s;&s;ions, as Hor|ror,
Grief, Joy and De&s;ire. But to
the End that we may Diver&s;ifie this
Treati&s;e as much as we can, and
not tire out the Reader with too
much Speculation at a time, we
&s;hall omit &s;peaking of them till we
come to the Epick Poets.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="139">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Recapitulation; and that Reli|gion
is the Ba&s;is and Foun|dation
of the greater Poe|try.</HEAD>
<P>BUT now let us Recapitulate:
We have &s;hewn in the fore|going
part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that
Pa&s;&s;ion is the Characteri&s;tical Mark
of Poetry, and that all Poetry is
pathetick; and then we divided it
into two Kinds, the greater and the
le&s;s; and &s;hew'd that the greater
Poetry, comprehends Epick, Tra|gick
and the greater Lyrick; and
that our De&s;ign was in the fir&s;t
place to treat of that. Then we
proceeded to &s;hew, that as Pa&s;&s;ion
is the Characteri&s;tical Mark of
Poetry, great Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be the
<PB N="95" REF="140">
Characteri&s;tical Mark of the grea|ter
Poetry, and con&s;equently that
this la&s;t mu&s;t have every where
great Pa&s;&s;ion; but that &s;ince what
we commonly call Pa&s;&s;ion cannot
be ev'ry where, there mu&s;t be
&s;omething di&s;tinct from ordinary
Pa&s;&s;ion, and that mu&s;t be Enthu&s;i|a&s;m.
Then we endeavour'd to
di&s;cover what Enthu&s;ia&s;m is, and
how many &s;everal &s;orts there are
of it; and that Admiration and
Terrour make the Principal great|ne&s;s
of Poetry, and are the chief
of the Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions; that
tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ions are to bear pro|portion
with the Ideas from which
they are deriv'd, and that con&s;e|quently
the greate&s;t mu&s;t flow
from Religious Ideas. We &s;hall
&s;hew too in the Sequel of this
Di&s;cour&s;e, that not only the remain|ing
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Pa&s;&s;ions, Horror,
Sadne&s;s, Joy and De&s;ire; but that
ev'n the Ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions which
contribute mo&s;t to the greatne&s;s
of Poetry as Admiration, Terrour
and Pitty are chiefly to be deriv'd
<PB N="96" REF="141">
from Religion; but that the Pa&s;|&s;ions
of both &s;orts, mu&s;t for the
mo&s;t part flow greater from Re|velation
than from Natural Reli|gion,
becau&s;e all Reveal'd Religion
whether true or pretended &s;peaks to
the Sen&s;es, brings the wonders of
another World more Home to us,
and &s;o makes the Pa&s;&s;ions which it
Rai&s;es the greater.</P>
<P>The Fundamental Rule then that
we pretend to lay down, for the
Succeeding, or Excelling in the
greater Poetry, is that the Con&s;titu|tion
of the Poem, be Religious that
it may be throughout Pathetick.</P>
<P>And we pretend to prove un|deniably
that not only the Gentle|men,
who&s;e works we de&s;ign to ex|amine,
have &s;ucceeded and excell'd
no further than their Poems have
been &s;o con&s;tituted; but that never
any Poets of any Nation or any
Age, ever did or can excel with|out
it. I have already prov'd in
the Advancement of modern Poetry,
<PB N="97" REF="142">
beyond all manner of doubt, to tho&s;e
who have Capacity enough to com|prehend
the Arguments, that the
Ancient Poets excell'd the moderns
in the greatne&s;s of Poetry, for no
other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e their Sub|jects
were Religious in their con|&s;titution.
And therefore all that I
&s;hall &s;ay of it here is, that Poetry
is the Natural Language of Reli|gion,
and that Religion at fir&s;t pro|duc'd
it, as a Cau&s;e produces its
Effect. In the fir&s;t Ages of wri|ting
among the Graecians, there was
nothing writ but Ver&s;e, becau&s;e
they wrote of nothing but Religion
which was nece&s;&s;ary for the Ce|menting
the Societies which in tho&s;e
times were but ju&s;t united, and Na|ture
had taught them, that Poetry
was the only Language in which
they could worthily treat of the
mo&s;t Important parts of Religion,
or worthily perform its mo&s;t Im|portant
Duties: But as &s;oon as Re|ligion
was &s;ufficiently imprinted in
the Minds of Men, and they had
jei&s;ure to Treat of Human things
<PB N="98" REF="143">
in their writings they, invented
Pro&s;e, and invented it in Imitation
of Ver&s;e, as <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us in the
fir&s;t Book of his Geography; but
after that Pro&s;e was invented, by
them; never any of them treated
of their Gods or their Religious
matters, in Pro&s;e, before the Age
of <HI>Socrates,</HI> becau&s;e they found that
that way of writing, was by no
means proper for it. For the won|ders
of Religion naturally threw them
upon great Pa&s;&s;ions, and great pa&s;|&s;ions
naturally threw them upon
Harmony, and Figurative Lan|guage,
as they mo&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity
do, any Poet as long as he con|tinues
Ma&s;ter of them. Which is
known by Experience to all who
are Poets, for never any one while
he was rapt with Enthu&s;ia&s;m or
with Ordinary Pa&s;&s;ion, wanted
either Words or Harmony, and there|fore&punc;
Poetry is more Harmonious
than Pro&s;e becau&s;e it is more Pa|thetick.
Even in Pro&s;e your Ora|tors
and all who pretend to move
the Pa&s;&s;ions, have more Harmonious
<PB N="99" REF="144">
Periods than they who barely &s;peak
to the Rea&s;on. And in Poetry they
who write with a great deal of
Pa&s;&s;ion are Generally very Harmo|nious,
whereas tho&s;e who write
with but little are not &s;o Mu&s;ical.
<HI>Horace</HI> is an Illu&s;trious Example of
this. No Man who has read his
Odes can doubt of the finene&s;s and
the Delicacy of his Ear; and there|fore
his Satyrs are often Har&s;h and
Rugged becau&s;e the Spirit in them
is mean and little. No Man can
believe that <HI>Juvenal</HI> had a finer
Ear, than <HI>Horace,</HI> but yet his Satyrs
are more Mu&s;ical becau&s;e they have
a greater Spirit in them. At the
&s;ame time tis a little odd to con|&s;ider,
that Pa&s;&s;ion which di&s;turbs the
Soul, &s;hould occa&s;ion it to produce
Harmony, which &s;eems to emply
the Order and Compo&s;ure of it.
Whether this proceeds from the
Secret Effort that the Soul makes, to
Compo&s;e it &s;elf or whatever the
cau&s;e is, the Effect is certain. But
as Pa&s;&s;ion, which is the Di&s;order of
the Soul; produces Harmony which
<PB N="100" REF="145">
is Agreement; &s;o Harmony which
is Concord Augments and propa|gates
Pa&s;&s;ion which is Di&s;cord. All
who are acquainted with Poetry
or Mu&s;ick mu&s;t be as &s;en&s;ible of
this, as Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> was fully con|vinc'd
of it,
<Q><L>Well &s;ounding Ver&s;es are the Charm we u&s;e,</L>
<L>Heroick Thoughts and Virtue to infu&s;e;</L>
<L>Things of deep Sen&s;e we may in Pro&s;e unfold,</L>
<L>But they move more in lofty Numbers told;</L>
<L>By the loud Trumpet which our Courage aids,</L>
<L>We learn that Sound as well as Sen&s;e per&s;uades.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus we may &s;ee by Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>
that Numbers are proper to move
Pa&s;&s;ion, and for that Rea&s;on are
in&s;eperable from Poetry which has
no other De&s;ign. But we &s;hall
have occa&s;ion to treat of Harmony
more at large when we come to
the particular &s;orts of Poems, in the
mean time let us Return to the bu|&s;ine&s;s
from which we may &s;eem to
have digre&s;s'd.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="146">
As we have formerly undeniably
prov'd in the advancement of
Modern Poetry, that the Ancient
Poets deriv'd that Advantage which
they have over the Moderns to the
con&s;tituting their Subjects after a
Religious manner; &s;o I &s;hall make
it appear in the &s;equel of this Di&s;|cour&s;e,
that it was owing to the
&s;ame thing that the ancient Poets
very often excell'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And I have Rea&s;on to believe
that one of the Principal Rea&s;ons,
that has made the Modern Poetry
&s;o contemptible, is, that by dive&s;t|ing
it &s;elf of Religion, it is fall'n
from its dignity, and its original
Nature and Excellence, and from
the greate&s;t production of the Mind
of Man, is dwindled to an extra|vagant
and a vain Amu&s;ement.
For the Modern Poetry being for
the mo&s;t part Prophane, has either
very little Spirit, or if it has a
great one, that Spirit is out of
Nature, becau&s;e it bears no man|ner
<PB N="102" REF="147">
of Proportion to the Ideas from
which it is forcibly denv'd, nor the
Ideas very often to the Objects from
which they are taken; for as
Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>In boundle&s;s Ver&s;e the Fancy &s;oars too high</L>
<L>For any Object but the Deity.</L>
<L>What Mortal can with Heav'n pretend to &s;hare</L>
<L>In the Superlatives of Wi&s;e and Fair?</L>
<L>A meaner Object when with the&s;e we grace</L>
<L>A Giant Habit on a Dwarf we place.</L></Q></P>
<P>But that the Modern Poetry as
mi&s;erably as it is fall'n from the
Dignity of its original Nature,
might gloriou&s;ly ari&s;e and lift up
its Head, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing ev'n that of
the Ancients, if the Poets would
but con&s;titute their Subjects Reli|gious,
I have formerly clearly &s;hewn
in the Second Part of the Advance|ment
of Modern Poetry; by &s;hew|ing
that the De&s;ign of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion is the very &s;ame, with
<PB N="103" REF="148">
that of Poetry, which can be &s;aid
of no other Religion, that the bu|&s;ine&s;s
of both is to delight and re|form
mankind, by exciting the
Pa&s;&s;ions in &s;uch a manner as to re|concile
them to Rea&s;on, and re&s;tore
the Harmony of the humane Facul|ties.
And therefore that I may re|peat
nothing at pre&s;ent that I have
formerly &s;aid there; I &s;hall only
add, that if 'tis Religion that gives
the warmth and the Pa&s;&s;ion to
Poetry, it follows that the le&s;s mix|ture
that Religion has of any thing
Prophane and Humane in it, the
greater warmth and Pa&s;&s;ion it mu&s;t
give to Poetry; for that which
moves us in effect in a fal&s;e Religion
mu&s;t be the Imagination of that
which is true. As for Example in
the above mention'd pa&s;&s;age of the
wrath of <HI>Neptune;</HI> the Anger of
<HI>Neptune</HI> is Fiction, and &s;o is the
Stroke of His Trident; but that which
moves us at the bottom of this
Fiction is true, which is, that the
Anger of a Deity and the effects of
it are very terrible. The Rea|&s;on
<PB N="104" REF="149">
why Religion moves the Soul
&s;o extreamly, is becau&s;e the Soul
was Created by God, to find its
Happine&s;s in Him, and all Happi|ne&s;s
con&s;i&s;ts in Plea&s;ure, and all
Plea&s;ure in Pa&s;&s;ion. Now the le&s;s
mixture Religion has of any thing
of Human Invention in it, the more
Divine it is and the nearer it brings
us to God.</P>
<P>But that this may &s;till appear
the more clearly, we &s;hall Endea|vour
to prove it by two very Sig|nal
Examples, and &s;hall produce two
pa&s;&s;ages from Scripture; the one
from the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> and the other from
<HI>Habbakuk;</HI> which we &s;hall &s;et again&s;t
the Two foremention'd Pa&s;&s;ages
which <HI>Longinus</HI> cited from <HI>Ho|mer;</HI>
the one of the Wrath and the O|ther
of the Power of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and
his awful march through his own
Element; and in &s;etting the&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages
again&s;t one another we make
no doubt to &s;hew, that not only
the Subjects are exactly the &s;ame,
but that the Advantage is clearly
ours.</P>

<P>But here it will be Nece&s;&s;ary to
an&s;wer an Objection, for it may be
urg'd perhaps that Common Expe|rience
will De&s;troy the&s;e new Specu|lations.
For &s;everal of the Moderns
have attempted Divine Poetry, and yet
&s;ome of them have been Contemp|tible
to the la&s;t Degree, and not
one of them has excell'd the An|cients.</P>
<P>To which we an&s;wer that <HI>Milton</HI>
has clearly the advantage of the An|cients
in &s;everal points, as &s;hall be
&s;hewn in its proper place; and if the
re&s;t of the Moderns who have attemp|ted
Sacred Poetry have fall'n &s;o very
much &s;hort of them, it has been either
for want of Genius or for want of
Art to know how to make u&s;e of
Religion. For Sacred Poetry ap|parently
requires a greater capacity
than the Prophane does, becau&s;e
the greater the Ideas are, the greater
<PB N="112" REF="157">
mu&s;t the Capacity be that receives
them. But Sacred Ideas are greater
then the Prophane, as hath been
&s;hewn above. And therefore if the
Rule of <HI>Horace</HI> be true, that a Poet
ought to proportion his Subject to
his Strength, it follows that a Man
may Succeed pretty well in Hu|man
Poetry and yet be de&s;picable in
the Divine. Be&s;ides as Religion
&s;upplies us with greater Ideas than
any thing Human can do; &s;o it re|quires
greater Enthu&s;ia&s;m and a
greater Spirit to attend them, as
has been &s;hewn above too. So that
Sacred Poetry requires not only a
very great Capacity, but a very
warm and Strong Imagination;
which is a happy mixture that is to be
met with in a very few, and ev'n of
tho&s;e few not one in a Thou&s;and per|haps
applies him&s;elf to &s;acred Poetry.
And ev'n of tho&s;e rare ones who have
apply'd them&s;elves hardly one of the
Moderns has known the true u&s;e that
ought to be made of Religion in
Poetry. <HI>Milton,</HI> indeed happen'd
upon it, in his Paridi&s;e lo&s;t, I &s;ay hap|pen'd
upon it, becau&s;e He has err'd
<PB N="113" REF="158">
very widely from it in his Paradi&s;e
Regain'd, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its pro|per
place. The Rules for Employ|ing
Religion in Poetry are Principal|ly
the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>1. The Fir&s;t is, That the Reli|gion
ought to be one, that the
Poet may be mov'd by it, and
that he may appear to be in ear|ne&s;t.
And the not ob&s;erving of
this Rule, was one Rea&s;on why
<HI>Spencer</HI> mi&s;carried as we &s;hall &s;hew
anon.</P>
<P>2. The Second Rule, That the
Religion which the Poet Employs
ought to be the Reigning one,
that both the Poet and the Rea|ders
may be mov'd the more by
a Religion in which they were
bred. And this Rule may acquaint us
with one of the rea&s;ons why all who
have tran&s;lated <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI>
have &s;ucceeded &s;o very indiffe|rently.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="159">
3. The Third is that it may run
thro' and be incorporated with the
Action of the Poem, and con&s;e|quently
that it may always be a
part of Action and Productive of
Action, for from the neglect of
this Third Rule, &s;trange inequali|ties
would follow in a Poem, as
&s;hall be &s;hewn more at large,
when we treat of <HI>Spencer</HI> and
<HI>Cowley.</HI></P>
<P>4. The Fourth Rule is, That the
Religion may be manag'd &s;o as to
promote the violence of the En|thu&s;ia&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ions and their change
and variety; and the con&s;tituting
his Subject contrary to this Rule,
was one great rea&s;on why <HI>Milton</HI>
did not &s;ucceed in his Paradi&s;e
Regain'd.</P>
<P>5. That it may not hinder the
Violence of the ordinary Pa&s;&s;ions,
nor the Change and Variety of
them; and the not con&s;tituting
his Subject according to this
<PB N="115" REF="160">
Rule is the chief rea&s;on, why
<HI>Homer</HI> in his Ody&s;&s;es fell &s;o far
&s;hort of his Iliads; and <HI>Milton</HI> of
his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, in his Paradi&s;e
Regain'd.</P>
<P>6. That the Religion be manag'd
&s;o as not to ob&s;truct the violence
of Action, which is always attend|ed
by the violence of ordinary
Pa&s;&s;ion; and the not ob&s;erving of
this, was one great Rea&s;on of the
mi&s;carriage of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI>
in the foremention'd Poems.</P>
<P>7. That the Divine and Humane
Per&s;ons if there be any, may have
Inclinations and Affections, which
<HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s Cele&s;tial Per&s;ons have not,
nor as I Remember <HI>Cowley</HI>'s.</P>
<P>8. That they be fairly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
from one another, by tho&s;e
Inclinations and Affections. And
this is the great Advantage that
the Grecian Machines, have for
the mo&s;t part over tho&s;e in our Re|ligion.
Yet <HI>Milton</HI> has pretty well
<PB N="116" REF="161">
di&s;tingui&s;h'd his Cele&s;tial Per&s;ons
from one another, and his Infernal
ones admirably.</P>
<P>4. That they be fairly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
from the Human Per&s;ons, by
the &s;ame Inclinations and Affections.
And here <HI>Milton</HI> in his Infernal
Per&s;ons has undeniably the Advan|tage,
both of Ancients and Moderns.
The Pa&s;&s;ions and Inclinations of
the Graecian Gods, are downright
Human Inclinations and Affections.
The Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Miltons</HI>'s Devils have
enough of Humanity in them to
make them delightful, but then they
have a great deal more to make
them admirable and may be &s;aid
to be the true Pa&s;&s;ions of Devils;
but the time to &s;peak more largely
of this will be when we come to
the Epick Poets.</P>
<P>But now as we have &s;hewn that
the Religion Reveal'd in the Old
and New Te&s;tament is proper, nay
Nece&s;&s;ary to give the la&s;t force
and Elevation to Poetry; we &s;hall
<PB N="117" REF="162">
now Endeavour to Convince the
Reader that Poetry is proper if not
Nece&s;&s;ary, to give force to that
Religion. For indeed there are Du|ties
in this Religion, which cannot
be worthily perform'd without the
a &s;&s;i&s;tance of Poetry. As the offe|ring
up Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving
and &s;everal &s;orts of Pray'r to God;
and the Celebrating the Wonders
of his Might? Becau&s;e if the Ideas
which the&s;e Subjects afford; are
expre&s;t with Pa&s;&s;ion equal to their
greatne&s;s, that which expre&s;&s;es them
is Poetry, for that which makes
Poetry to be what it is, is only
becau&s;e it has more Pa&s;&s;ion than
any other way of writing.</P>
<P>It is Ridiculous to Imagine that
there can be a more proper way to Ex|pre&s;s
&s;ome parts and Duties of a Re|ligion
which we believe to be Di|vinely
in&s;pir'd, than the very way
in which they were at fir&s;t deli|ver'd.
Now the mo&s;t Important
part of the Old Te&s;tament was
deliver'd not only in a Poetical
<PB N="118" REF="163">
Style but in Poetical Numbers. The
mo&s;t Important parts of the Old
Te&s;tament to us are the Prophe&s;ies.
Becau&s;e without them we could
never be &s;atisfied that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is
the Me&s;&s;iah, For the Prophets
were Poets by the In&s;titution of
their Order, and Poetry was one
of the Prophetick Functions, which
were chiefly Three. 1. Predicting
or foretelling things to come. 2.
Declaring the will of God to the
People. And 3. Prai&s;ing God with
Songs of the Prophets compo&s;ing,
accompanied with the Harp and
other In&s;trumental Mu&s;ick. From
whence it came to pa&s;s, that
prai&s;ing God upon &s;uch kind of
In&s;truments, is often in the Scrip|tures
call'd Prophecying, as Mr.
<HI>Mede</HI> has ob&s;erv'd in his Diatribae;
and has prov'd it from &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages
of the Old Te&s;tament, and
more particularly from the 3 Fir&s;t
Ver&s;es of the 25th Ch. of the <HI>Chro|nicles,</HI>
which are as follows.</P>
<P>V. 1.Moreover <HI>David</HI> and the
Captains of the Ho&s;t, &s;eperated to
<PB N="119" REF="164">
the Service of the Sons of <HI>A&s;aph,</HI>
and of <HI>Heman,</HI> and of <HI>Jeduthun,</HI>
&s;uch as &s;hould Prophe&s;ie with Harps,
with P&s;alteries and with Cymbals, and
the Number of the Workmen accord|ing
to their &s;ervice was</P>
<P>V. 2. Of the Sons of <HI>A&s;aph; Zac|car,</HI>
and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and <HI>Nethaniah</HI> and
<HI>A&s;arelah,</HI> the Sons of <HI>A&s;aph;</HI> under
the Hands of <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> which Prophe&s;ied
according to the Order of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>V. 3.Of <HI>Jeduthun,</HI> the Sons of
<HI>Jeduthun, Gedaliah</HI> and <HI>Zeri</HI> and <HI>Je|&s;haiah,
Ha&s;habiah,</HI> and <HI>Metithiah</HI>
Six, under the Hands of their Father
<HI>Jeduthun, who Prophe&s;ied with a Harp,
to give thanks and to prai&s;e the
Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was their Poetical Talent
confin'd to their Prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving,
but is to be &s;een in their
Predictions too as we &s;aid before,
and in their declaring the Will of
God to the People.</P>
<P>As the Prophets were Poets by
their In&s;titution, &s;o when the Son
<PB N="120" REF="165">
of God him&s;elf, came down from
Heaven in order to reform the
Earth, He who was a Prophet as
well as a Prie&s;t and a King, did
by con&s;equence di&s;charge the Three
Prophetical Functions, of which
the Poetical has been &s;hewn to be
one. And con&s;equently tho' our
Saviour did not make u&s;e of a
Style, that was Figurative and
Enthu&s;ia&s;tick; becau&s;e he In&s;tructed
the World as God, and as God He
could not feel either Admiration or
Terrour, or the re&s;t of the Enthu&s;ia|&s;tick
Pa&s;&s;ions, yet we find that
He not only prais'd God with &s;pi|ritual
Songs, but that the Method
of His In&s;truction was entirely
Poetical, that is by Fables or Pa|rables,
contriv'd and plac'd and
adapted to work very &s;trongly up|on
Human Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophets among the
Jews were Poets, and the Divine
In&s;titutor of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on
being a Prophet, by a Poetical
method in&s;tructed and reform'd the
<PB N="121" REF="166">
World. And ev'n the Graecian Poets
pretending to di&s;charge the Three
Prophetical Functions, were not only
vulgarly reputed Prophets but were
ftyl'd &s;o by St. <HI>Paul</HI> Him&s;elf, who
quoting a ver&s;e out of <HI>Epimenides</HI>
in the Epi&s;tle which He wrote to
<HI>Titus,</HI> calls that Creten&s;ian Poet a
Prophet. <HI>As one of their own Pro|phets
has &s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have made it very
plain, that not only the Predictions
but the Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving,
in the In&s;pir'd Writers were written
in Ver&s;e; as were likewi&s;e &s;everal
of the Prayers, and the In&s;tructions,
and in &s;hort the Noble&s;t and mo&s;tIm|portant
part of the Old Te&s;tament:
Now if they were written in Po|etry,
it could be for no other Rea|&s;on,
but becau&s;e they who wrote
them, Believ'd that the Figurative
Pa&s;&s;ionate Style, and the Poetical
Numbers did by Right of Nature
belong to them, and Con&s;e|quently
were requi&s;ite to inforce
them upon the Minds of Men. And
<PB N="122" REF="167">
here we cannot as it were help ob|&s;erving,
that for the Scriptures to
make all the Impre&s;&s;ion that they
are Capable of making upon Men
of very good parts, and perhaps
too upon others, all tho&s;e parts of
them that were written in Ver&s;e
ought to be tran&s;lated in Ver&s;e; and
by Per&s;ons who are the mo&s;t qua|lify'd
to do it with Force and Har|mony.
For if the Pa&s;&s;ion and
Harmony were thought requi&s;ite
by the Original Writers, who were
Divinely in&s;pir'd to give force to
the Hebrew; why &s;hould not Spi|rit
and Pa&s;&s;ion and Numbers in a
Tran&s;lation give a Proportionable
force to that? For if Harmony of
it &s;elf is of force to lift up our
Thoughts to Heaven, as our
Clergy &s;eem to Emply by the u&s;e
of it in our Churches; and may
be gathered from what happen'd
to <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> in the Second of <HI>Kings,</HI>
when they would have had him
Prophe&s;ie at a time when the Spirit
of Prophe&s;ie Ch. 3. v. 15. was not upon
him. Where the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>now bring
me a Min&s;trel, and it came to pa&s;s
<PB N="123" REF="168">
as the Min&s;trel plaid that the Hand
of the Lord came upon him.</HI></P>
<P>If Harmony I &s;ay is of it &s;elf &s;o ef|ficacious,
what mu&s;t it not be,
when Incorporated with a Religi|gious
Sen&s;e, and a Poetical Style.
There can certainly be no better
way to Reform the World than
the reading of tho&s;e Writings which
we believe to be divinely in&s;pir'd;
But this is as certain, that the
greater the plea&s;ure is with which we
Read them, we &s;hall the more
frequently di&s;charge that Duty, but
to make us read them with more
plea&s;ure than we do, they mu&s;t have
more of the agreablene&s;s of their
Originals, that is more Per&s;picuity,
more Force and more Harmony. This
would more particularly attract the
Gentry, and particularly tho&s;e of
the mo&s;t Extraordinary Parts among
them, who&s;e examples would influ|ence
the re&s;t as the re&s;t would influ|ence
the People. For they of extra|ordinary
Parts for the mo&s;t part being
Extreamly delighted with Poetry,
<PB N="124" REF="169">
and finding the greate&s;t and mo&s;t
exalted Poetry upon Religious Sub|jects,
would by degrees become more
us'd to be mov'd by Sacred Ideas
than they would by prophane; that
is would by degrees become re|form'd.
That this is by no
means a Chimera, Experience may
&s;erve to convince us. For I know
&s;everal Gentlemen of very good
Sen&s;e who are extreamly mov'd
by <HI>Miltons</HI> Hymn in the fifth Book
of Paradi&s;e lo&s;t, and hardly at all
&s;tirr'd with the Tran&s;lation of the
148 <HI>P&s;alm</HI> from whence that Hymn
is taken. But if Men of very good
parts are more mov'd by the Hymn,
it follows that they ought to be
more mov'd by it; becau&s;e Men of
very good Sen&s;e are only mov'd to
that Degree by things by which
they ought to be mov'd. So that
we may Conclude that the Pa&s;&s;i|on
or Enthu&s;ia&s;m in that Hymn
is exactly in Nature, that is, that
the Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or Pa&s;&s;ion, or Spirit
call it what you will, flows from
the Ideas, and bears a ju&s;t Propor|tion
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="170">
But from hence at the &s;ame
time it follows, that &s;ince tho&s;e
Per&s;ons who are &s;o much mov'd
by the Hymn, are not equally &s;tirr'd
by the Translated P&s;alm, the Pa&s;|&s;ion
or Spirit is le&s;s in the latter
and do's not come up to the Ideas;
and therefore we may conclude
that <HI>Milton</HI> by his Genius and Har|mony
has re&s;tor'd that Spirit in
Compo&s;ing the Hymn, which had
been lo&s;t by the weakne&s;s of the
Tran&s;lation and the want of Poe|tical
Numbers. Which la&s;t as we
have &s;aid before contribute very
much to the rai&s;ing of Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What <HI>Milton</HI> has done in relation
to the 148 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> others may do
in a le&s;s proportion to other parts
of the Old Te&s;tament, till the Fa|vour
of the Prince and publick En|couragement
cau&s;es another <HI>Milton</HI>
to ari&s;e and apply Him&s;elf to &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o noble a work.
For this is certain that there are
not wanting great Genius's to every
Age. But they do not equally ap|pear
<PB N="126" REF="171">
in every Age, &s;ometimes for want
of knowing them&s;elves; and &s;ome|times
for want of Encouragement
and lei&s;ure to exert them&s;elves. The
bu&s;ine&s;s of the following Treati&s;e is to
&s;hew them how they may try and
know, and form them&s;elves, which
is all that I am capable of attempting
towards the Re&s;toring &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o
noble an Art. If I were in a Condi|tion
to give them Encouragement
too they &s;hould not be long with|out
it. If they who &s;o much ex|ceed
me in Pow'r, did but equal
me in Will, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee
Poetry rai&s;e up its dejected Head,
and our own might come to emu|late
the Happie&s;t of Grecian and
Roman Ages.</P>
<P>And thus much may &s;uffice to
&s;hew the Nature of Poetry, but
chiefly of the greater Poetry,
and the Importance of this De|&s;ign.
For &s;ince Poetry has been
thought not only by Heathens, but
by the Writers of the Old Te&s;ta|ment,
and con&s;equently by God
Him&s;elf who in&s;pir'd them, to be
<PB N="127" REF="172">
the fitte&s;t method for the inforcing
Religion upon the Minds of Men,
