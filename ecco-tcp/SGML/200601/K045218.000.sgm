<HI>GEORGE DODINGTON,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
One of the LORDS COMMISSIONERS of His
Maje&s;ty's Trea&s;ury.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE following little Treati&s;e is, to all Ap|pearance,
&s;o very a Trifle, that I &s;hould
not have the A&s;&s;urance to addre&s;s it to a
Gentleman of your di&s;tingui&s;h'd Rank, if
my chief De&s;ign were not to engage you,
in order to promote the Honour of your
Country, and the Good of the learned World, to take
upon you the Protection of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dramatical Mu&s;es,
&s;o far at lea&s;t as to pronounce in their Favour. 'Tis the
Sen&s;e of all who have the Honour to be acquainted with
you, that you have a perfect Knowledge of the Merits of
the Cau&s;e, and Ability and Authority to determine it in
the la&s;t Appeal. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dramatick Mu&s;es make this
Reque&s;t to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> who have been barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed both
by their Friends and their Enemies; for by their Friends
they have been more than once poorly de&s;erted, and a|bandon'd
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to the Slanders and the unju&s;t Accu&s;ations of
their mo&s;t inveterate Enemies.</P>
<P>I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if they are not idle Dreamers
who believe, that a great, a powerful, and an opulent Peo|ple
can be without publick Diver&s;ions; or if it is fitting
they &s;hould be without them. I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if
a great and a brave People, by being often a&s;&s;embled and
plea&s;ed together, will not be the more plea&s;ed with one
another, and the more among them&s;elves united.</P>
<P>But as all Plea&s;ures and Diver&s;ions, both publick and
private, are barbarous or gentle, rational or &s;en&s;ual, man|ly
or effeminate, noble or ba&s;e and degenerate; 'tis agreed
on by all the &s;en&s;ible World, that the publick Diver&s;ions
of a free Nation, ought neither to be barbarous, nor &s;en|&s;ual,
nor ba&s;e, nor effeminate; becau&s;e publick Diver&s;ions
of the fir&s;t Kind reflect Di&s;honour upon a brave Nation;
and Diver&s;ions of the other three Kinds have a natural
Tendency to the introducing a general and total Corrup|tion
of Manners, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with Liberty.</P>
<P>The publick Diver&s;ions which are at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h'd
in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> are either the Combats of our modern
Gladiators, or the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's, or the Ma&s;querades,
or Tragedies and Comedies, which are the only genuine
legitimate Entertainments of the Stage.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the Combats of our modern
Gladiators, I appeal to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> who by travelling have
had the Advantage of knowing the Sentiments and Man|ners
of other Nations, if they are not regarded by all
<HI>Europe,</HI> excepting our &s;elves, with Horror, and e&s;teem'd to
be neither agreeable to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, nor to
the Manners of a civilized People.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
As to the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera's, they are allow'd by all the
impartial World to be &s;en&s;ual and effeminate, compared to
the genuine Drama, and a greater real Promoter of wanton
and &s;en&s;ual Thoughts than ever the Drama was pretended
to be, becau&s;e too great a Part of them con&s;i&s;ting of Soft|ne&s;s
of Sound, and of Wantonne&s;s of Thought, they have
nothing of that good Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, and that artful
Contrivance which are e&s;&s;ential to the Drama. No, you
know very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> that good Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, and
every &s;trict Attention to an artful De&s;ign, are &s;o many
natural and moral Re&s;traints upon wanton and &s;en&s;ual
Thoughts.</P>
<P>I now, <HI>Sir,</HI> de&s;ire Leave to &s;ay &s;omething concerning
Ma&s;querades, which Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirms to be more innocent
than the Drama, which is a frontle&s;s A&s;&s;ertion, and the very
Rever&s;e of Rea&s;on. I remember one of our Comick Poets
ob&s;erves, that young Ladies run a greater Risk of their
Reputations by being familiar with Fools, than with Men
of Sen&s;e; becau&s;e Fools have but one Way of pa&s;&s;ing their
Time with them: So Ma&s;querades having neither the
Sen&s;e of the Drama, nor the Sound of the Opera, Per&s;ons
of both Sexes may go to them either with no De&s;ign, or
with a very vile one. To which I might add the late Re|mark
of a wi&s;e and pious Prelate, which is, <HI>That Ma&s;que|rades
deprive Virtue and Religion of their la&s;t Refuge, Shame;
which,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>keeps Multitudes of Sinners within the
Bounds of Decency, after they have broke thro' all the Ties
of Principle and Con&s;cience. But this Invention &s;ets them
free from that al&s;o; being neither better nor wor&s;e, than an
Opportunity to &s;ay and do there, what Virtue, Decency, and
Good Manners, will not permit to be &s;aid or done in any other
Place.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
This wi&s;e and pious Prelate, in this very Pa&s;&s;age, cen|&s;ures
the Per&s;ons of either Sex, who frequent lewd and
prophane Plays: But he does not a&s;&s;ert here, that there
are no Plays but what are lewd and prophane. And he
affirms, that Ma&s;querades are of more dangerous Con&s;e|quence
to Virtue and Good Manners, than ev'n Plays
which are prophane.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> I have endeavour'd to &s;hew, that of three
of the pre&s;ent reigning Diver&s;ions, one is cruel and bar|barous,
and not at all becoming either of a Chri&s;tian or a
civilized Nation; the Second effeminate, wanton, and &s;en|&s;ual;
and the Third, either very unmeaning, or el&s;e neither
moral nor chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>No Art of Man in the mo&s;t happy Age of the mo&s;t
happy Nation, has been able to find out a publick Diver|&s;ion
that has been rea&s;onable, noble, manly, and virtuous,
but the Drama, when it is writ as it ought be. And yet
the&s;e wild Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who have &s;hot their Bolts again&s;t
the Stage, have &s;aid not a Word again&s;t the other three,
which cannot be defended by the lea&s;t Pretence that any
of them can have to Goodne&s;s or moral In&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> The following Treati&s;e is not only a Defence of
Dramatick Poetry, but of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, in
the Admini&s;tration of which the Wi&s;dom of the King has
given you an illu&s;trious Share, and again&s;t which Mr.
<HI>Law</HI>'s Pamphlet is obliquely de&s;igned; as were the Writ|ings
which his two Predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Collier</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> pub|li&s;h'd
again&s;t the Stage. <HI>Collier,</HI> by his Action, and <HI>Bed|ford,</HI>
by his other Writings, becau&s;e profe&s;s'd and declar'd
Enemies to the Government: One of them ab&s;olved an im|penitent
Traytor, who died with Trea&s;on in his Mouth;
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
and the other, upon publi&s;hing his Book upon Hereditary
Right, was impri&s;on'd for High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Sir,</HI> the following Treati&s;e was likewi&s;e de&s;ign'd
in Defence of all the People of Quality of both Sexes in
<HI>England,</HI> and of all the People in any Country throughout
the Chri&s;tian World, where they frequent any Theatres;
all which numerous People he has very charitably given
to the Devil to have and to hold for ever.</P>
<Q><L>Nor Engine nor Device Polemick,</L>
<L>Di&s;ea&s;e nor Doctor Epedemic,</L>
<L>E'er &s;ent &s;o va&s;t a Colony</L>
<L>To the infernal World as he.</L></Q>
<P>But all that I have been able to do in the Defence of &s;o
good a Cau&s;e, is to &s;hew, that I heartily wi&s;h well to it.
It belongs to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> and to tho&s;e few who re&s;emble
you, who have Di&s;cernment and Ta&s;te, that qualify you
to determine &s;urely, and Honour and Ju&s;tice enough to
engage you to pronounce and judge impartially, to take
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Drama into your Protection and Patronage,
in order to retrieve its former Lu&s;tre, and augment its
Glory.</P>
<P>By taking the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Theatre into your Protection and
Patronage, you would protect and patronize every other
Branch of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poetry. For as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Theatre,
as long as it was ju&s;tly and judiciou&s;ly managed among us,
was the only publick Rewarder of Dramatick Poetry, &s;o
it has been the only chief Support and Encouragement of
every other Species of that noble Art. It has cheri&s;h'd
and inflamed the Spirit of Poetry, and rai&s;ed a noble E|mulation
among us, more than all our Kings and all our
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
Mini&s;ters together. From the very building of <HI>London,</HI>
to the erecting the fir&s;t Theatre in it, which Time con|tains
about thirty Centuries, we had but two <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Poets who de&s;erve to be read: But from the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of our Theatres to the pre&s;ent Time, which contains
&s;carce a Century and a half, we may boldly affirm, that
more than ten times that Number of Poets have appear'd
and flouri&s;h'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I beg Leave to ob&s;erve the Advantage
of Genius that <HI>Great Britain</HI> has over <HI>France</HI> with Rela|tion
to the Drama: For our Neighbours the <HI>French,</HI> not|with&s;tanding
the va&s;t Encouragement that was given by
Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> and by <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIVth, at the In&s;ti|gation
of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert</HI> his Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, never could
with Ju&s;tice boa&s;t of more than one Comick and two
Tragick Poets; whereas more than ten of our Country|men,
have, without any publick Encouragement but what
they derived from the Stage it&s;elf (and that, how incon|&s;iderable!)
&s;ignalized them&s;elves in Comedy alone, with|in
the Compa&s;s of tho&s;e fifty Years that followed the
Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>I know, indeed, very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> that other Rea&s;ons may
be a&s;&s;igned, be&s;ides the Want of a Theatre, why no more
Poets flouri&s;hed before Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time. But I
am at the &s;ame Time convinced, that the Rea&s;on why we
have had &s;o many &s;ince, has been the E&s;tabli&s;hment of
our Theatres. For the Dramatick Poets, the Ca&s;e is plain,
few would have given them&s;elves the Trouble to write
Dramatick Poems, if there had not been Theatres in
which they might be acted. And &s;ome, who were by
Nature qualified to &s;ucceed better in other Kinds of Poetry
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
than the Dramatick, had, by Rea&s;on of the Lowne&s;s of
their Fortunes, been uncapable of exerting their Genius's
in tho&s;e other Kinds, if they had not been fir&s;t encou|raged,
and rai&s;ed, and &s;upported by the Stage. And 'tis
very natural to conceive, that &s;everal others, who at the
&s;ame time that they had large Revenues, were qualified
both by Nature and Art to excel in the other Kinds, were
rouzed and excited to try their Fortunes in them, by the
animating Applau&s;es which they &s;aw that our Dramatick
Poets received from their ravi&s;h'd Audiences. The Sen|timent
of <HI>Virgil</HI> might, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, very naturally
pre&s;ent it&s;elf to their Minds.<Q><L>&mdash;Tentanda via e&s;t qu&acirc; me quoque po&s;&s;im</L>
<L>Tollere humo, victorque vir&ucirc;m volitare per ora.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ince the chief Encouragement not only
of Plays, but of every other Kind of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poetry,
which is none of the meane&s;t Branches of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Learning, depends upon the Stage, and con&s;equently the
Honour of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends upon
it, I humbly conceive, that the flouri&s;hing Condition of
our Theatre is a Matter of Importance and publick Con|cern,
and not unworthy the Con&s;ideration of the greate&s;t
Men in the State.</P>
<P>Since Dramatick Poetry was fir&s;t introduced into <HI>England,</HI>
it never was &s;unk &s;o deplorably low as it is at pre&s;ent, and
every other Branch of Poetry is declined proportionably;
I mean as far as it has been managed by mo&s;t of tho&s;e who
have li&s;ted them&s;elves under <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Standard, and who
engage for their Pay. That little that has appeared that
<PB N="x" REF="9">
has been writ with more Spirit and more Grace than ordi|nary,
has come, for the mo&s;t Part, from Volunteers.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> with Submi&s;&s;ion to your better Judgment, there is
but one Way of reviving the expiring Drama, of re&s;toring
its original Innocence, and of augmenting its ancient Lu|&s;tre,
and that is by e&s;tabli&s;hing two annual Prizes of two
hundred Pound each; the one for Comedy, the other for
Tragedy, to be given, be&s;ides the ordinary Profits of the
Theatre, to him who performs be&s;t in each of them, which
is to be decided by Judges appointed on purpo&s;e, and
&s;worn to determine impartially; with this Provi&s;o, that
no Play &s;hall be received, that &s;hall be judged to be ever
&s;o little offen&s;ive to good Manners; and that every Play
&s;hall be rejected, who&s;e Author can be proved to have ta|ken
the lea&s;t Step towards the forming a Cabal; which
De&s;ign I humbly conceive is in your Power to reduce to
Practice, if you would vouch&s;afe to recommend it to the
Government, or to a Number of Gentlemen who may be
every way qualify'd to engage in &s;o good a Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Several Cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned of the Decay of Dra|matick
Peotry, as the <HI>Italian Opera,</HI> which never was e|&s;tabli&s;hed
in any Country, but it immediately deba&s;ed the
Poetry of that Nation: The Strangers who have been in|troduced
among us, by &s;everal great Events, as the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI>
the <HI>Union,</HI> the <HI>Hanover Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> who not under|&s;tanding
our Language, have been very in&s;trumental in
introducing Sound and Show; the new Gentry that has
&s;tarted up among us, &s;ome by the Fortune of War, and
&s;ome by the Fortune of <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> who are fond of
their old Entertainments of <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>; but yet none
of the&s;e has done half the Harm that has been done by
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
Cabal. For 'tis in Poetry as 'tis in Politicks, Things go
quite wrong
<Q><L>When Merit pines, while Clamour is prefer'd,</L>
<L>And long Attachment waits among the Herd;</L>
<L>When no Di&s;tinction where Di&s;tinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the Many the &s;uperior Few.</L></Q></P>
<P>A Cabal to e&s;pou&s;e a Coxcomb, may get him Money, but at the &s;ame Time it will procure him Infamy. Wri|ters
who have Genius will leave the Stage with the ut|mo&s;t
Indignation, and every Man who under&s;tands it
will have it in Contempt.</P>
<Q><L>The Men who contradict the publick Voice,</L>
<L>And &s;trive to dignify a worthle&s;s Choice;</L>
<L>Attempt a Task that on that Choice reflects,</L>
<L>And lend us Light to point out new Defects.</L>
<L>One worthle&s;s Man, that gains what he pretends,</L>
<L>Di&s;gu&s;ts a Thou&s;and unpretending Friends.</L></Q>
<P>And therefore every Writer who pretends to &s;ucceed by
Cabals, ought to be bani&s;hed from every Theatre. But
to &s;hew the Judgment or the Integrity of our Managers
of the Stage; they have for &s;everal Years pa&s;t rejected
every Play that has not had a Cabal to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> tho' I am &s;en&s;ible that I have already
detain'd you a great deal too long, for which I humbly
and heartily beg your Pardon; yet, before I take Leave
of you, I cannot help acquainting you, that this is the
fourth Time that I have appear'd in Defence of the Stage,
and in this fourth Defence I have no manner of Intere&s;t,
but that it has been purely extorted from me by the Force
<PB REF="11">
of Truth, and by the Love of my Country. In the for|mer
Three, I might appear to be maintaining my own In|tere&s;ts.
But I have, &s;ince the publi&s;hing them, been u&s;ed
with &s;uch extreme Ingratitude by the pre&s;ent Managers of
the Playhou&s;e, that I have this Ten Years been obliged,
by the mo&s;t barbarous Treatment, to take Leave of the
Playhou&s;e for ever.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN you de&s;ire to know my Senti|ments
concerning Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s late Pam|phlet
again&s;t the Stage, you make a Re|que&s;t,
which 'tis not &s;o ea&s;y for me to
&s;atisfy as you may perhaps imagine:
For I really never was &s;o much at a
Lo&s;s to know what an Author meant.
Sometimes I am inclined to think him in good earne&s;t;
and &s;ometimes I believe, that there are Grounds to &s;u&s;|bect,
that he de&s;ign'd this whole Pamphlet for nothing
but a &s;piritual Banter; for there &s;eems to me to be a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of believing, either that a Clergyman, as Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
is, &s;hould be profoundly ignorant of the &s;acred Writings,
a Man of Letters of the Nature of Dramatick Poems,
and one who had liv'd long enough in the World to have
&s;ome Experience of the pre&s;ent State of Religion, and
Virtue, and Vice, among us; or a Nece&s;&s;ity of conclud|ing,
<PB N="2" REF="13">
that while Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is declaiming with &s;o much fu|rious
Zeal again&s;t the Stage and Players, he is all that
while acting a Part, and &s;hewing him&s;elf a great Come|dian.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is putting Idolatry and frequenting the
Playhou&s;e upon an equal Foot, he &s;eems to be playing a
Part: for he cannot but know, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was of ano|ther
Mind, who when he was at <HI>Athens,</HI> the very Source
of Dramatick Poetry, &s;aid a great deal publickly again&s;t
their Idolatry, but not one Word again&s;t their Stage.
When he was afterwards at <HI>Corinth,</HI> as little did he &s;ay
again&s;t theirs: For St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was educated in all the
Learning of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who had read all their Poets,
who in the vjth Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> Ver. 28, quotes <HI>A|ratus,</HI>
and <HI>Epimenides,</HI> in the fir&s;t Chapter of his Epi&s;tle
to <HI>Titus,</HI> Ver. 10, could not but have read all their noble
Dramatick Poems; and yet has been &s;o far from &s;peaking
one Word again&s;t them, that he has made u&s;e of them for
the In&s;truction and Conver&s;ion of Mankind. And when
afterwards he wrote his Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI>
he did not &s;cruple, for their In&s;truction, to make u&s;e of
an <HI>Athenian</HI> Play; for all the World knows, that <HI>Evil
Communications corrupt Good Manners,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 33. is
taken from an <HI>Athenian</HI> Dramatick Poet. Does Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
believe that that Epi&s;tle, and con&s;equently that Ver&s;e, was
dictated by the Holy Gho&s;t or not? Can Mr. <HI>Law</HI> be|lieve,
that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was guided by the Spirit of God to
make Choice of that Ver&s;e for the In&s;truction&punc; and Con|ver&s;ion
of the <HI>Corinthians?</HI> And can he believe at the
&s;ame Time, that the Theatre, as he more than once de|clares
<PB N="3" REF="14">
it, is the Temple of the Devil? If any one &s;hould
affirm, That St. <HI>Paul</HI> was guided by the Spirit of God,
to take a Ver&s;e from the Temple of the Devil, would it
not be &s;uch horrid Bla&s;phemy as would make even the
Blood of the mo&s;t profligate of all Players to curdle with|in
the Mi&s;creant's Veins. But if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had in the
lea&s;t believed, that the <HI>Athenian</HI> Stage was the Sink of
Sin and Corruption, as Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;ays every Stage is, he
would not have fail'd to reproach them with it, in order
to check the &s;preading Evil. He who dares talk openly
and boldly again&s;t the National Religion of a People,
may very well venture to condemn their Vices and evil
Cu&s;toms. But St. <HI>Paul</HI> not only &s;ays nothing at all
again&s;t Dramatick Poetry, but makes u&s;e of it for the
Conver&s;ion and Reformation of Mankind. Now I would
fain know, if quoting a Dramatick Poet, without giving
the lea&s;t Caution again&s;t the Stage, be not a downright
Approbation of Dramatick Poetry, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the
Stage by no le&s;&s;er an Authority than that of the Spirit of
God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If we look into the Old Te&s;tament, we &s;hall find, that
the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> they and their Reigns,
were declared righteous or wicked, according as tho&s;e
Kings were Idolaters or not Idolaters; and that no Sin
whatever was reckon'd &s;o abominable as Idolatry. <HI>So|lomon,</HI>
who had &s;even hundred Wives, had no le&s;s than
three hundred Concubines; and yet when God threatened
to rend Ten Tribes of his Subjects from him, it was only
for his Idolatry, <HI>becau&s;e he had for&s;aken God, and had
wor&s;hipped A&s;htoreth the Godde&s;s of the Sidonians, Chemo&s;h</HI><PB N="4" REF="15"><HI>the God of the Moabites, and Milcom the God of the Chil|dren
of Ammon,</HI> 1 Kings xj. <HI>For it came to pa&s;s, that
when Solomon was old, his Wives turned away his Hear
after other Gods, and his Heart was not perfect with the
Lord his God, as was the Heart of David his Father,</HI>
ibid. Ver. 4. Now <HI>David</HI> committed Adultery with <HI>Bath|&s;heba,</HI> and murdered her Husband <HI>Uriah</HI>; yet the&s;e Sin
that were of &s;o flagrant a Nature that they brought
a Plague upon <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were venial, compared to Idolatry.
They brought, indeed, a Plague upon the People, but
they depo&s;ed the King from no Part of his Subjects, as
the Idolatry of <HI>Solomon</HI> did his Son <HI>Rehoboam.</HI> In &s;hort,
Idolatry is by &s;o much more criminal than the Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion
of any other divine Commandment, as the Attempt
to depo&s;e a King and to &s;et up a Pretender, is a Crime
of a higher Nature than the Breach of any other human
Law.</P>
<P>As it is hard to imagine, that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;hould be ig|norant
of what has been &s;aid above, it gave me ju&s;t Cau&s;e
to &s;u&s;pect his Sincerity: But when I came to the Pa&s;&s;age
which he quotes from Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> in the 38th
Page of his Pamplet, I found that he prevaricated
&s;o vilely in it, that the Hypocri&s;y became immediately ma|nife&s;t:
For he has omitted the former Part of the Pa&s;&s;age,
becau&s;e it makes directly again&s;t him. It is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>To &s;peak again&s;t them</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Plays) <HI>in general, may
be thought too &s;evere, and that which the pre&s;ent Age cannot
&s;o well brook, and would not perhaps be &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able,
becau&s;e it is very po&s;&s;ible they might be &s;o framed, and</HI><PB N="5" REF="16">
<HI>governed by &s;uch Rules, as not only to be innocent and di|verting,
but in&s;tructive and u&s;eful, to put &s;ome Vices and
Follies out of Countenance, which cannot perhaps be &s;o de|cently
reproved, nor &s;o effectually expo&s;ed and corrected any
other Way.</HI> All this, as I have &s;aid above, he has pur|po&s;ely
omitted, becau&s;e it makes point blank again&s;t him.</P>
<P>For after he has told us, in this ble&s;&s;ed Pamphlet, <HI>That
the Playhou&s;e is the Temple of the Devil, a more delightful
Habitation for him than ever any Temple that he had in the
Heathen World, where Impurity and Filthine&s;s, immode&s;t
Songs, prophane Rants, Lu&s;t, and Pa&s;&s;ions, entertain the
Audience, a Place, the peculiar Plea&s;ure of the Devil, where
all they who go, yield to the Devil, go over to his Party, and
become Members of his Congregation, where all the Laughter
is not only vain and fooli&s;h, but that it is a Laughter among
Devils; that all who are there, are upon prophane Ground,
and hearing Mu&s;ick in the very Porch of Hell.</HI> After he
has be&s;tow'd all this fine Language upon it, and all the&s;e
fragrant Flowers of Rhetorick, he a&s;&s;ures us, that the
Playhou&s;e is all that he has &s;aid, not thro' any accidental
Abu&s;e, as any innocent or good Thing may be abu&s;ed,
but by its genuine Helli&s;h Nature; which is directly con|trary
to what the foremention'd illu&s;trious Prelate has &s;aid.
Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;ays, that every Entertainment of the Stage is
in its Nature unlawful, abominable, and infernal. The
Archbi&s;hop a&s;&s;ures us, that the Entertainments of the
Stage may be &s;o managed, as not only to be innocent,
but u&s;eful and in&s;tructive; nay, that they may even be|come
nece&s;&s;ary for the expo&s;ing &s;ome certain Follies, and
the correcting &s;ome certain Vices.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="17">
As Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has &s;hewn his Want of Sincerity in the
fore&s;aid Quotation, he gives us great Rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect
it in his Invectives again&s;t the Drama. For 'tis hard to
conceive, that a Man of Letters &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of
the Nature of a legitimate Dramatick Poem, as tho&s;e In|vectives
&s;uppo&s;e him; for 'tis &s;uch only that we pretend
to defend, and abhor the Productions of ignorant and
impure Poeta&s;ters as much as he does. 'Tis hard to con|ceive,
that a Man who has read the Cla&s;&s;icks, &s;hould not
know that a legitimate Dramatick Poem, either of the
Comick or Tragick Kind, is a Fable, and as much a Fa|ble
as any one of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s, agreeing in Genus, and differ|ing
only in Species. <HI>Terence</HI> has told him in almo&s;t every
one of his Prologues, that every Comedy is a Fable;
and he begins his very fir&s;t to <HI>Andrea</HI> with it.
<Q><L>Poeta cum primum animum ad &s;cribendum appulit,</L>
<L>Id &s;ibi negoti credidit &s;olum dari,</L>
<L>Populo ut placerent quas feci&s;&s;et Fabulas.</L></Q>
And <HI>Horace</HI> tells us the &s;ame Thing concerning Tragedy,
more than once or twice:
<Q><L>Neve minor quinto, neu &s;it productior actu</L>
<L>Fabula. <BIBL>De Arte Poet.</BIBL></L></Q>
And we find in the &s;ame Treati&s;e;
<Q><L>Interdam &s;pecio&s;a locis, morataque recte</L>
<L>Fabula.</L></Q>
And likewi&s;e again;
<Q><L>Nec Quodcunque volet po&s;cat &s;ibi Fabula credi.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Law</HI> cannot but know, that the In&s;truction by
Fables and Parables, which mean the &s;ame Thing, was
<PB N="7" REF="18">
mightily in U&s;e among the wi&s;e Ancients, and e&s;pecially
among the &s;acred Writers; that we have an Example of
it, of about three thou&s;and Years &s;tanding, in the Parable
of <HI>Jothan.</HI> And that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who be&s;t knew the
Nature of Men, made u&s;e of Fables or Parables, as mo&s;t
proper at the &s;ame Time, both to plea&s;e, and in&s;truct, and
per&s;wade. For a Fable is a Di&s;cour&s;e mo&s;t aptly con|trived
to form the Manners of Men by In&s;tructions di&s;|gui&s;ed
under the Allegory of an Action. And therefore
he could not chu&s;e but know, that every legitimate Dra|matick
Poem, either of the Comick or Tragick Kind, is not
a mere Diver&s;ion, as he pretends, but a philo&s;ophical and
moral Lecture, in which the Poet is Teacher, and the
Spectators are his Di&s;ciples, as <HI>Horace</HI> in&s;inuates in the
three following Ver&s;es:
<Q><L>Nec minimum meruere Decus ve&s;tigia Graeca</L>
<L>Au&s;i de&s;erere &amp; celebrare Dome&s;tica Facta</L>
<L>Vel qui Praetextas, vel qui docuere togatas.</L></Q>
And knowing all this, he could not but know that 'tis
very hard, if not very extravagant, to put the frequenting
moral Lectures upon the &s;ame Foot with Idolatry.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has read either <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> or any of his In|terpreters,
as 'tis hard to imagine that he &s;hould think
him&s;elf qualified to write again&s;t the Stage if he had read
none of them, he cannot but know, that as the Action of
a Dramatick Fable is univer&s;al and allegorical, the Chara|cters
are &s;o likewi&s;e. For as when <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> introduces a
Hor&s;e, or a Dog, or a Wolf, or a Lion, he does not pre|tend
to &s;hew us any &s;ingular Animal, but only to &s;hew the
<PB N="8" REF="19">
Nature of that Creature, as far as the Occa&s;ion where it
appears admits of; &s;o when a Dramatick Poet &s;ets before
us his Characters, he does not pretend to entertain us
with particular Per&s;ons, tho' he may give them particular
Names; but propo&s;es to lay before us general and alle|gorical
Fantoms, and to make them talk and act as Per|&s;ons
compounded of &s;uch and &s;uch Qualities, would talk
and act upon like Occa&s;ions, in order to give proper In|&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Now as a Dramatick Fable is a Di&s;cour&s;e invented to
form the Manners by In&s;tructions di&s;gui&s;ed under the Al|legory
of an Action, it follows, that in a Dramatick Fa|ble
for the proving the Moral, 'tis as nece&s;&s;ary to intro|duce
vicious as virtuous Characters, and to make them
&s;peak and act, as all Per&s;ons compounded of their Qua|lities
would be obliged by Nature to &s;peak and act upon
the like Occa&s;ions; as <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> for the Sake of his Morals,
does not only introduce innocent and peaceable Creatures,
as Hor&s;es, and Sheep, and Cows, and Dogs; but like|wi&s;e
noxious and violent ones, as Lions and Bears, and
Wolves, and Foxes: But the Poet at the &s;ame time ought
to take care that the Vices &s;hould be &s;hewn after &s;uch a
Manner, as to render them odious or ridiculous, and
not agreeable or de&s;irable; and that the Reader &s;hould
reap no Plea&s;ure from the Agreeablene&s;s of the Vices, but
only from a ju&s;t Imitation of Nature.</P>
<P>I make no Doubt, Sir, but that I have &s;aid enough to
&s;atifie you or any of your Friends to whom you may
happen to &s;hew this Letter, that as every true Dramatick
<PB N="9" REF="20">
Poem is a Fable as much as any one of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s; it has in
its Nature a direct Tendency to teach moral Virtue, and
can therefore never be contrary to a Chri&s;tian Temper and
Cirit, which, where-ever it is, incites us to good Works,
that is, to the Performance of moral Duties. But there is
every Jot as much Difference between a true Dramatick
Poem, and the Production of an ignorant ob&s;cene Poe|ta&s;ter,
as there is between two religious Books, the <HI>Bible</HI>
and the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Now will Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirm, that becau&s;e
the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is full of egregious Fal&s;hoods, and of mon|&s;trous
Fanatick Extravagancies, therefore we ought not
to read the <HI>Bible?</HI> It belongs to none but to an Athei&s;t,
or &s;ome other unbelieving Sceptick, to make &s;uch a Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> As 'tis hard to conceive that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;hould be
ignorant of what we have &s;aid above, both concerning the
&s;acred Writings, and the Nature of a Dramatick Poem;
and equally hard, if he is not ignorant, to believe him a
Writer of Sincerity and Integrity; &s;o it &s;eems to be as
hard to conceive, that a Man of his Years, and con&s;e|quently
of his Experience, &s;hould be utterly a Stranger
to the pre&s;ent State of Religion, and Virtue and Vice, a|mong
us; or that, if he is not a Stranger to it, he &s;hould
be capable of writing &s;o malicious or &s;o erroneous a Trea|ti&s;e
as that which he has lately publi&s;h'd again&s;t the Stage.</P>
<P>Before I come to &s;peak of the pre&s;ent State of Religion
among us, I de&s;ire Leave to tran&s;late a Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Da|cier</HI>'s
Preface to his excellent Comment on <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Art
of Poetry.</HI> If the Quotation appears to be of more than
<PB N="10" REF="21">
ordinary Length to you, I comfort my &s;elf with this Re|flection,
that you will attend to an Author of more than
ordinary Learning and Judgment, and who can &s;peak &s;
much better in this Cau&s;e than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Poetry, &s;ays that mo&s;t judicious Critick, is an Art
which was invented for the In&s;truction of Mankind, and
an Art which is by Con&s;equence u&s;eful. 'Tis a Truth
acknowledg'd by all the World, that every Art is in
it&s;elf good, becau&s;e there is none who&s;e End and De&s;ign
is not &s;o: But as it is no le&s;s true, that Men are apt to
abu&s;e the very be&s;t Things, and to pervert the very be&s;t
De&s;igns, that which was at fir&s;t invented as a whol&s;ome
Remedy, may afterwards become a very dangerous Poi&s;on.
I am obliged to declare, then, that in what I &s;ay of
Tragedy, I &s;peak not of corrupted Tragedy: For'tis
not in Works that are deprav'd and vicious that we are
to &s;earch for the Rea&s;on and the De&s;ign of Nature, but
in tho&s;e which are &s;ound and intire; when I &s;ay this
&s;peak of ancient Tragedy, of that which is conformable to the Rules of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which I dare pronounae
to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of all Diver|&s;ions
whatever.'</P>
<P>'If it were in our Power to oblige all Men to follow
the Precepts which the Go&s;pel lays down, nothing could
be more happy for Mankind. In living conformably to
them, they would find true Repo&s;e, &s;olid Plea&s;ure, and
a &s;ure Remedy for all their Infirmities; and they might
then look upon Tragedy as a u&s;ele&s;s Thing, and which
would be infinitely below them. How could they look
upon it in any other Light, &s;ince the Heathens them&s;elves
<PB N="11" REF="22">
beheld it in the very &s;ame, as &s;oon as they had embraced
the Study of Philo&s;ophy. They confe&s;s, that if People
could be always nouri&s;h'd with the &s;olid Truths of Phi|lo&s;ophy,
the Philo&s;ophers had never had Recour&s;e to
Fables, in order to give them In&s;truction. But as &s;o
much Corruption could not bear &s;o much Wi&s;dom, the
Philo&s;ophers were obliged to look for a Remedy for the
Di&s;order which they &s;aw in Mens Plea&s;ures; for which
they invented Tragedy, and they offered it to the World,
not as the mo&s;t excellent Thing of which Men could
make their Employment and their Study, but yet as a
Means to correct tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es, in which they were
wont to be plunged at their &s;olemn Fea&s;ts; and to ren|der
tho&s;e Diver&s;ions u&s;eful to them, which Cu&s;tom and
their Weakne&s;s had render'd nece&s;&s;ary, and their Cor|ruption
very dangerous.'</P>
<P>'What Men were formerly, they are To-day; and what
they are To-day, they will be hereafter; they have the
&s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions which they always had, and run with the
&s;ame Eagerne&s;s after Plea&s;ure. To undertake to reduce
them in this Condition by the Severity of Precepts, is
endeavouring to put a Bridle on a mad Hor&s;e in the
greate&s;t Rapidity of his Cour&s;e. In the mean time,
there is no Middle; Men will fall into the mo&s;t criminal
Exce&s;&s;es, unle&s;s we find Plea&s;ures for them which are
wi&s;e and regular. 'Tis &s;ome Degree of Happine&s;s, that
a Remnant of Rea&s;on inclines them to love &s;uch Diver|&s;ions
as are con&s;i&s;tent with Order, and &s;uch Amu&s;e|ments
as are not incompatible with Truth. And I am
per&s;uaded, that we are obliged in Charity to make our
Advantage of this Inclination, that we may not give
<PB N="12" REF="23">
time to Debauchery entirely to quench that Spark of
right Rea&s;on which &s;till may be &s;een to glimmer in them.
We pre&s;cribe to di&s;temper'd Per&s;ons; and Tragedy is the
only Remedy, from which, in their pre&s;ent Condition,
they can reap any Advantage; for 'tis the only Diver&s;ion
in which they can find the Profitable united with the
Plea&s;ant.'</P>
<P>Thus far Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier.</HI> And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I beg Leave
to ob&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding our Reformation, we
have as few Per&s;ons here in <HI>England</HI> who have the true
Spirit of Chri&s;tianity in them, as there are in <HI>France:</HI>
But there is this Difference between them and us; In
<HI>France,</HI> all own them&s;elves Chri&s;tians publickly; none of
them dare renounce the Name, tho' few of them are the
Thing: But among us, How many open Di&s;&s;enters are
there from Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf? How many Athei&s;ts? How
many Dei&s;ts? How many Free-thinkers of a Thou&s;and
Kinds? who all of them refu&s;e to join in our &s;acred Rites;
&s;ome of them, as the Athei&s;ts, believing them to be &s;en&s;
le&s;s|and ridiculous; and others, as the Dei&s;ts, e&s;teeming
them to be bla&s;phemous and idolatrous. Then what
School of publick Virtue and of publick Spirit have we
for too great a Part of our Youth, but our Theatres
only?</P>
<P>'Tis very &s;trange that Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;hould be &s;o ignorant
of the pre&s;ent State of Religion among us, as not to fore|&s;ee that the wild Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the &s;piritual Fanatical
Rant, which abounds &s;o much in his late Pamphlet, would
afford Matter of Scorn and Laughter to Infidels and Free|thinkers
<PB N="13" REF="24">
of all Sorts, and render our mo&s;t &s;acred Religion
&s;till more contemptible among them.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> &s;ays, in the 16th Page of his Pamphlet,
that <HI>It cannot be doubted by any one, that the Playhou&s;e is
a Nur&s;ery of Vice and Debauchery, and that the Effect it
has upon Peoples Manners is as vi&s;ible as the Sun at Noon</HI>;
he &s;eems to know as little of the pre&s;ent State of Vice
among us, as he pretends to do of Religion. The pre|&s;ent
reigning Vices of the Town, are Drinking, Gaming,
Cur&s;ing, Swearing, Prophane&s;s, Corruption of all Sorts,
as Bribing, Tricking, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Cheating, Whoring and
execrable Sodomy. And Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> for&s;ooth, has the Face
to tell the World, that the Playhou&s;e encourages all the&s;e;
that it is the Sink of Corruption and Debauchery; and
that that is not the State of it thro' any accidental Abu&s;e,
but that Corruption and Debauchery are the truly natural
and genuine Effects of the Stage-Entertainment, that is,
of any Stage-Entertainment. Now to &s;hew the Folly and
the Arrogance of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions, let us con&s;ider the&s;e
Vices one by one.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then; Does the Theatre encourage Drunkenne&s;s?
No; it neither does nor can encourage it: To &s;hew it,
is enough to render it odious or ridiculous. To &s;hew a
Man drunk, is to &s;hew a Fool or a Madman, in whom
the Creator's Image is for a Time intirely defaced, and
who, while he continues in that State, &s;tands in need of a
Guardian. Be&s;ides, nothing is more certain, than that
brutal Vice rages mo&s;t in the Scum and Off-&s;cowring of
the People, who neither have nor ever had the lea&s;t Com|munication
<PB N="14" REF="25">
with the Playhou&s;e. 'Tis true, Men of Thought
may be &s;ometimes drawn into it, but they naturally hate
it; for Drunkenne&s;s is a mortal Enemy to Thought, and
con&s;equently Thought to that.</P>
<P>Does the Playhou&s;e encourage Gaming? So far from
that, that Gaming has increa&s;ed ten-fold, &s;ince <HI>Collier</HI>'s
Books again&s;t the Stage were publi&s;hed; and &s;ince when,
whole Plays have been writ to &s;hew it dangerous and de|&s;tructive,
to &s;hew the un&s;peakable Harm it does to both
Sexes, and particularly to the Women; <HI>to &s;hew that Gam|ing,
by giving Men a Privilege of being familiar with, and
&s;ometimes rude to Women, removes that Awe which Nature
has placed between the Sexes, as the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwark of
Cha&s;tity; that when a young Lady, even of the &s;tricte&s;t, the
mo&s;t unblemi&s;h'd Honour, lo&s;es a Sum of Money, which &s;he
dares not own to her Relations, and which &s;he cannot pay
without them, and lo&s;es it to an agreeable young Fellow, who
perhaps loves her, and has a &s;ecret De&s;ign upon her, &s;he finds
a Temptation that trys her utmo&s;t Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Does the Playhou&s;e encourage Swearing and Cur&s;ing?
Both Rea&s;on and Experience a&s;&s;ure us that it does not.
They who walk the Streets in the We&s;t End of the Town
may be &s;ufficiently convinced, that it rages mo&s;t in the
Lees of the People, who never knew what a Playhou&s;e was.
It infects even their Wives and their Children, as it very
rarely does tho&s;e of the better Sort. As common Swearing
is a fooli&s;h brutal Vice, that brings neither Plea&s;ure nor
Profit with it, and is the Re&s;ult of want of Thought; it
follows, that the fooli&s;h brutal Part of the People mu&s;t be
<PB N="15" REF="26">
mo&s;t infected with it. Of the Women that frequent the
Playhou&s;e, few are addicted to it but the common Strum|pets;
and of the Men, none but Bullies, Rakes, and gid|dy
Coxcombs. If a Comick Poet draws any of the&s;e, in
order to correct and amend them, he is obliged to &s;hew
them &s;ometimes Swearing, or he leaves out one of their
Characteri&s;ticks. But he cannot fail of &s;hewing that very
Quality either odious or ridiculous, when it appears in
Per&s;ons who are them&s;elves both the one and the other.
And if he &s;hews it either odious or ridiculous, that &s;urely
will invite none of the Audience to imitate it.</P>
<P>We equally deny, that the Playhou&s;e encourages any
other Sort of Prophane&s;s. But as a Play is a Fable, that is, a
Compo&s;ition of Truth and Fiction (as we have ob&s;erved
above;) as the Action is feigned and the Moral true; as
Characters are nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on the Action, and
or proving the Moral, and vicious Characters as nece&s;&s;ary,
and perhaps &s;ometimes more nece&s;&s;ary, than are the good
ones; as to &s;hew vicious Characters, and to expo&s;e them,
'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put vicious Sentiments into
their Mouths, it follows, that the mo&s;t criminal Sentiments,
and the mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ions, are allowable in vicious and
violent Characters; the mo&s;t ungovern'd Fury, and the
mo&s;t outragious Bla&s;phemy it&s;elf, not excepted; provided
they are adapted to the Character and the Occa&s;ion, and
the Character and the Occa&s;ion are nece&s;&s;ary for the Moral.
<HI>Virgil</HI> has every where &s;hewn <HI>Mezentius</HI> a Contemner of
the Gods, and a Bla&s;phemer of them; yet we never heard
that the mo&s;t bigotted of his Cotemporaries ever accu&s;ed
<HI>Virgil</HI> upon that Account. <HI>Milton,</HI> in the &s;econd Book of
<PB N="16" REF="27">
<HI>Paradice lo&s;t,</HI> makes the Devils, in their infernal Council,
bla&s;pheme in a mo&s;t outragious Manner; and yet, as they
&s;peak agreeably to their Characters and the Occa&s;ion, no
Man has ever been &s;o weak or &s;o unju&s;t, as to accu&s;e <HI>Mil|ton</HI>
for that Bla&s;phemy, or to give all his Readers to the
Devil for being entertained with it. On the contrary, all
Men of good Under&s;tanding, and good Ta&s;te, have been
peculiarly charm'd with that very Book, as one of the mo&s;t
beautiful of that admirable Poem. <HI>Cowley</HI> makes not only
the Devil, but <HI>Goliah</HI> bla&s;pheme;
<Q><L>Thus he bla&s;phem'd aloud; The Hills around,</L>
<L>Flatt'ring his Voice, re&s;tor'd the dreadful Sound.</L></Q>
and yet has been never blamed for it. The Book of <HI>Job</HI>
is canonical, and is firmly believed to have been writ by
divine In&s;piration. Tho' it is full of uncharitable Judg|ments,
and is not free from Bla&s;phemy, yet the In&s;tructions
which that divine Parable or Fable gives, proceed in a
great mea&s;ure from that very Bla&s;phemy, and tho&s;e uncha|ritable
Judgments. But now, if a Poet is allow'd to put
Bla&s;phemy into the Mouth of one of his Characters, pro|vided
he takes care to puni&s;h him for it, he is certainly at
Liberty to do the like by any inferior Prophane&s;s.</P>
<P>The Three Nonjuring Prie&s;ts who have attack'd the
Stage, have made &s;uch a Noi&s;e about nothing as Propha|ne&s;s;
it &s;ometimes drops three or four Times in one
Page from their tautologous Pens; and they have chiefly
accu&s;ed our Comedies for it: The Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of
which may appear from hence, that all our true Comedies
are but Copies of the fooli&s;h or vicious Originals of the
<PB N="17" REF="28">
Age. Certainly never Man knew what a Comedy was
better than did <HI>Moliere.</HI> Now when in the Critic of the
<HI>Ecole des Femmes,</HI> he is endeavouring to prove, by the
Mouth of <HI>Dorante,</HI> that Comedy is harder to write than
Tragedy, he gives the following Rea&s;on for it: <HI>Lors que
vous peignez des Heros, vous faites ce que vous voulez;
ce &s;ont des Portraits a plai&s;ir, ou l'ou ne cherche de re&s;&s;em|blance;
et vous n'avez qu'a &s;uivre les Traits d'une Ima|gination
qui &s;e donne l'e&s;&s;or, et qui &s;ouvent lai&s;&s;e le vrai pour
atraper le</HI> Merveilleux. <HI>Mais lors que vous peignez les Hom|mes,
il faut peindre d'apres Nature; on veut qui ces Portraits
re&s;&s;emblent, et vous n'avez rien fait &s;i vous n'y faites recon|noitre
le Gens de votre Siecle.</HI> That is to &s;ay; When you
draw Heroes, you are at your own Liberty; tho&s;e are
Pictures at the Painter's Plea&s;ure, in which no Body looks
for Likene&s;s; and you have nothing to do but to indulge
the Flight of a &s;oaring Imagination. But when you paint
Men, you mu&s;t draw after Nature; the World expects
that tho&s;e Pictures &s;hould be like; and you have done
nothing at all, unle&s;s you &s;hew your Readers or your
Spectators the People of the Age you live in.</P>
<P>Now with Regard to Prophane&s;s, our Comedies are the
fainte&s;t Copies in the World, and you may often hear more
Prophane&s;s in one Night's Conver&s;ation at a Tavern or an
Eating-hou&s;e, than you &s;hall hear from the Stage in a
year. For Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, Arians, and Socinians, are
wont to &s;ay at their private Meetings, what no one dares
to pronounce on the Stage. Now are not the&s;e Nonjuring
Prie&s;ts either very wi&s;e, or very con&s;cientious Per&s;ons? Our
Comedies are but Copies of the fooli&s;h and vicious Origi|nals
<PB N="18" REF="29">
of the Age; and 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Copies to
expo&s;e, and &s;atyrize, and ridicule tho&s;e fooli&s;h and tho&s;e
vicious Originals. Now the&s;e Nonjuring Prie&s;ts having
nothing to &s;ay again&s;t tho&s;e fooli&s;h and tho&s;e vicious Ori|ginals,
which mo&s;t certainly corrupt and debauch the Age,
make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to fall foul on the Copies, which
cha&s;ti&s;e, and &s;atyrize, and ridicule the Originals.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid of the Stage with Relation to Pro|phane&s;s,
is in Proportion true, with Regard to all other
Vices. Now &s;ince our Comedies are but Copies of the fool|i&s;h
and the vicious Originals of the Age in which we live,
and Copies which do by no means come up to the Ori|ginals,
I appeal to all the World, if it does not unan&s;wer|ably
follow from what I have &s;aid, that the Originals of
the Age debauch the Stage, by which latter, the Age never
po&s;&s;ibly can be debauched. The Stage was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in
<HI>England</HI> towards the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
Reign; whereas the Manners of the People continued ge|nerally
&s;ound till beyond the Middle of the la&s;t Century&punc;
And the Manners of the People continuing generally &s;ound,
the Stage remain'd generally cha&s;te: But at the Re&s;tora|tion
of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, the Court returning from a|broad,
corrupted by foreign Luxury, quickly debauch'd
the Town; and the Court and the Town jointly endea|vour'd
to debauch the Stage, becau&s;e our Comick Poets
were obliged to copy their lewd Originals, in order to ex|po&s;e
and reform them.</P>
<P>As for Corruption of any Sort, whether it be Tricking,
Oppre&s;&s;ing, Bribing, Sharping, Cheating, the true Poet,
<PB N="19" REF="30">
who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> perfectly free from all Avarice, is lea&s;t of all ad|dicted
to it.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Vatis Avarus.</L>
<L>Non temere e&s;t animus, ver&s;us amat, hoc &s;tudet unum</L>
<L>Detrimenta, fugas &s;ervorum, incendia ridet;</L>
<L>Non fraudem &s;ocio, puerove incogitat ullam</L>
<L>Pupillo; <BIBL>Horace Epi&s;t. ad Augu&s;tum.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Their u&s;ual Poverty is a &s;ignal Proof of this: For as the
Love of Money is the Source of all Corruption, he who
de&s;pi&s;es Gold, is above all the Vices that attend it. And
Poverty attended with great Parts, may very well pa&s;s for
a pretty &s;ure Sign of Hone&s;ty. A Dramatick Poet there|fore
being aver&s;e from all Corruption him&s;elf, if ever he
de&s;cribes any Kind of it, is &s;ure to make it both odious
and ridiculous.</P>
<P>I come now to almo&s;t the only Charge again&s;t the Stage
which &s;eems to have any thing of real Weight in it, and
that is, That it excites in Mens Minds the natural Love
of Women. And here by this Charge may be meant two
Things; the one is, That it excites in Men a De&s;ire to
the unlawful Enjoyment of Women; the other is, That it
inclines them to that violent Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, which is
&s;ometimes between the two Sexes.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Part of the Charge, that it excites in
Men a De&s;ire to the unlawful Enjoyment of Women; if
there are any Pa&s;&s;ages in our Plays that are chargeable
with that Guilt, or that defile the Imaginations of an Au|dience
with uncha&s;t and immode&s;t Images, they are nei|ther
<PB N="20" REF="31">
natural to the Drama nor nece&s;&s;ary, but flagrant A|bu&s;es
of it, and contrary to the very De&s;ign of the Art;
and tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages ought to be bani&s;h'd from the Stage for
ever. And yet I cannot help thinking, that if ever tho&s;e
Pa&s;&s;ages could be excu&s;able, they would be &s;o at this Jun|cture,
when the execrable Sin of Sodomy is &s;pread &s;o
wide, that the fore&s;aid Pa&s;&s;ages might be of &s;ome U&s;e to
the reducing Mens Minds to the natural De&s;ire of Wo|men.
Let Fornication be ever &s;o crying a Sin, yet So|domy
is a Crime of a thou&s;and times a deeper Dye. A
Crime that forc'd down &s;upernatural Fire from Heaven, to
extingui&s;h its infernal Flames; a Crime that would have
obliged even righteous <HI>Lot</HI> to pro&s;titute his two cha&s;t and
virgin Daughters, in order to prevent it. I cannot here omit
ob&s;erving one Thing, That this unnatural Sin has very
much increa&s;ed &s;ince <HI>Collier</HI>'s Books were publi&s;h'd again&s;t
the Stage. There were no le&s;s than four Per&s;ons con|demned
for it the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions; and I am inform'd, that
&s;everal more have been &s;ince apprehended for it: The like
of which was never heard of in <HI>Great Britain</HI> before.</P>
<P>As for the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, by which the Hearts of
Men and Women are &s;ometimes mutually and violently in|clined
to each other; if the Pa&s;&s;ion is kept within the
Bounds of Nature, if the Object and the Intention of it
is lawful, or if 'tis puni&s;h'd when 'tis unlawful, I am of
the Opinion, that it cannot have the lea&s;t ill Con&s;equence;
'tis certainly a Check upon wandring loo&s;e De&s;ires; it gives a
very great and very harmle&s;s Plea&s;ure, and has a direct Ten|dency
to the keeping the two Sexes &s;tedfa&s;t and firm to the
natural Love of each other: For not only the Affections of
<PB N="21" REF="32">
the Men have wildly wander'd from Nature, as is mani|fe&s;t
to all the World, but not a few of the Women too
have endeavour'd to make them&s;elves the Center of their
own Happine&s;s. St. <HI>Paul</HI> is pleas'd to reprove this unna|tural
Affection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Dames in the fir&s;t Chapter
of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Law</HI> is de&s;ired to
take Notice, that he lays tho&s;e unnatural De&s;ires not upon
their going to Plays, but upon their Idolatry; Ver&s;e 22,
<HI>Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, they became Fools.</HI> Ver&s;e
23, <HI>And changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an
Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four|footed
Bea&s;ts, and creeping Things.</HI> Ver&s;e 24, <HI>Wherefore
God al&s;o gave them up to Uncleanne&s;s, to di&s;honour their own
Bodies between them&s;elves.</HI> Ver&s;e 25, <HI>Who changed the
Truth of God into a Lie, and wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the
Creature rather than the Creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed for ever.
Amen.</HI> Ver&s;e 26, <HI>For this Cau&s;e God gave them up to vile
Affections: For even their Women did change the natural
U&s;e into that which is again&s;t Nature.</HI> Ver&s;e 27, <HI>And like|wi&s;e
the Men, leaving the natural U&s;e of the Women, burned
in their own Lu&s;ts one toward another, Men with Men work|ing
that which is un&s;eemly, and receiving in them&s;elves that
Recompence of their Errors which was meet.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Law</HI>
may be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the Apo&s;tle here gives us
another &s;ignal Proof, that he does not put Idolatry and
going to Plays upon an equal Foot. And here, <HI>Sir,</HI> I de|sire
Leave to make another Remark, and that is, That of
all the Countries of the Chri&s;tian World, that Country has
been, is, and is like to be, the mo&s;t infamous for this ex|ecrable
Vice, in which Idolatry has &s;et up its Head Quar|ters.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33">
<HI>Sir,</HI> You are very well acquainted with the exact Judg|ment
of the late <HI>French</HI> Satyri&s;t, who was an Honour to
<HI>France.</HI> That he was very far from being a Friend to the
Corruption of the Stage, will appear from the following
Pa&s;&s;age of the fourth Canto of his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>; where
he is giving his Advice to the Poets who were his Cotem|poraries.
<Q><L>Que votre ame &amp; vos moeurs peints dans tous vos ouvrages</L>
<L>N'offrent jamais de vous que de nobles Images.</L>
<L>Je ne puis e&s;timer ces dangereux Auteurs,</L>

<L>Trahi&s;&s;ant la vertu &s;ur un papier coupable,</L>
<L>Aux yeux de leurs Lectures rendent le vice aimable.</L></Q>
Tho' I know very well, that no one under&s;tands this Au|thor
better than you do; yet as this Letter is to pa&s;s thro'
your Hand to the Pre&s;s, I de&s;ire Leave to tran&s;late the
Pa&s;&s;age, for the Benefit of tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to <HI>French.</HI>
<Q>Let your Soul and your Manners, appearing in your Works
to your Readers, never offer any but noble Ideas of you.
I can have no E&s;teem for tho&s;e dangerous Authors, tho&s;e in|famous
De&s;erters of Honour in their Ver&s;es, who being Tray|tors
to Virtue in their guilty Lines, render Vice lovely to the
Eyes of tho&s;e who peru&s;e them.</Q>
And yet immediately after comes his Approbation of Love
in Dramatick Poems:
<Q><L>Je ne &s;uis pas pourtant de ces tri&s;tes E&s;prits</L>
<L>Qui banni&s;&s;ant l'Amour de tous cha&s;tes &ecirc;crits,</L>

Love, if 'tis cha&s;tly expre&s;s'd, excites no &s;hameful
Motion in us. In vain does <HI>Dido</HI> lament and groan, expo&s;ing
all her Charms to me; I condemn her Conduct at the very
Time that I partake of her Grief.</Q></P>
<P>I now return to the Charge of Hypocri&s;y; for which
there are very ju&s;t Grounds of Su&s;picion from the Stile
and Language of this Pamphlet. For is not this little
Treati&s;e, which is pretended to be writ thro' a Zeal for
the Chri&s;tian Religion, writ in downright Antichri&s;tian Lan|guage?
Is this Pamplet writ in the Language of Mode&s;ty,
of Humility, of Meekne&s;s? Is it writ in the attractive
Language of Charity? On the contrary, Does not Mr.
<HI>Law</HI> &s;eem to have taken all his Degrees at a certain Uni|ver&s;ity
between the Bridge and the Tower? And as the
Di&s;ciples of our Saviour, from Dealers in Fi&s;h became the
Apo&s;tles of their Ma&s;ter; this fal&s;e Apo&s;tle &s;eems to &s;et
up for Water Doctor, and from a Prie&s;t to become a Dealer
in Fi&s;h. For he has not only the Tropes, and the Figures,
and all the Rhetorical Flowers, but the very Tautologies
of tho&s;e ob&s;treperous Dealers in quiet and mute Animals.
For the fore&s;aid ob&s;treperous Dealers, are not contented
with calling Rogue, or Whore, or Bitch, or Villain, once,
<PB N="24" REF="35">
they will repeat it fifty Times; and their Fellow-Colle|giate
who di&s;putes with them, will return it fifty-fold.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire that you would give me leave to pre&s;ent you
with &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Rhetorical Flowers.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of the &s;econd Page of his Pamphlet, he
tells us, That there is more to be &s;aid in Behalf of Po|pery
than of going to Plays. For that is plainly his Mean|ing,
tho' he di&s;gui&s;es it by the Terms that he u&s;es. And
towards the Top of the third Page, he is no le&s;s po&s;itive,
that God is le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed with Popery than he is with
going to Plays. It looks as if Mr. <HI>Law</HI> would be very
glad to exchange Plays for Popery.</P>
<P>In all the re&s;t of the &s;econd Page, he puts them upon
an equal Foot; and a&s;&s;ures us, that the Entertainment of
the Stage is contrary to more Doctrines of Scripture than
the Wor&s;hip of Images.</P>
<P>What, tho' we grant it; Intemperance in Eating, Drink|ing,
and Venery, is contrary to more Doctrines of Scrip|ture,
than is either Murder, or High-Trea&s;on; and yet
either Murder or High-Trea&s;on &s;ingly, is ten Times a
greater Sin than all the forementioned Three together.
Sometimes he is making Idolatry, that is Popery, le&s;s
criminal than going to Plays: Sometimes he is for ma|king
them equal, and endeavouring to revive the old &s;to|ical
Opinion, <HI>Omnia peccata &s;unt aequalia</HI>; All Sins are e|qual:
A Paradox that would tend to make Chri&s;tianity as
ridiculous, as it help'd to do <HI>Pagan</HI> Stoici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="36">
In the fir&s;t Paragraph of the 4th Page. <HI>You go to hear
Plays you &s;ay&mdash;I tell you,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Law, you go to hear
Ribaldry and Prophane&s;s; that you entertain your Mind with
extravagant Thoughts, wild Rant, bla&s;phemous Speeches,
wanton Amours, prophane Je&s;ts, and impure Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> [Ay,
now the Language of the College begins.] And a little
lower, <HI>He who goes to a Play, diverts him&s;elf with the
Lewdne&s;s, Impudence, Prophane&s;s, and impure Di&s;cour&s;es of
the Stage.</HI> And a little lower, in the &s;ame Page, <HI>This is
plainly the Ca&s;e of the Stage; it is an Entertainment that
con&s;i&s;ts of lewd, impudent, prophane Di&s;cour&s;es.</HI> And Pag. 7,
<HI>It is an Entertainment made up of Lewdne&s;s, Prophane&s;s,
and all the extravagant Rant of di&s;order'd Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> At the
Top of Page 8. he is endeavouring once more to make
Popery le&s;s &s;inful than going to Plays; and by the &s;ame
Piece of &s;piritual Sophi&s;try, he confirms this religious Lie;
becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, the Stage, with its <HI>lewd prophane Di&s;|cour&s;es,</HI>
offends again&s;t more Doctrines of plain Scripture
than Popery: Which is proving one gro&s;s Piece of Fal&s;hood,
by another that is much greater.</P>
<P>About the Middle of the &s;ame Page, he brings an Ar|gument
again&s;t the Stage from the Iniquity of the Players,
again&s;t whom he inveighs with his u&s;ual Sophi&s;try and Un|charitablene&s;s:
Which is full as wi&s;e and as ju&s;t, as it would
be to bring an Argument again&s;t the Church, from the Vices
of &s;ome &s;piritual Comedians. <HI>The Players are Men and Wo|men,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>equally bold, in all In&s;tances of Prophane&s;s,
Pa&s;&s;ion, and Immode&s;ty; who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> Pag. 9, <HI>is prophane,
wicked, lewd, and immode&s;t</HI>; and a little lower in the &s;ame
Page, <HI>who&s;e Employment is le&s;s Chri&s;tian than that of Robbers.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="37">
<HI>For he mu&s;t know very little of the Nature of Religion,</HI> &s;ays

<P>Page 10, He &s;peaks of <HI>the Bla&s;phemy, Prophane&s;s, Lewdne&s;s,
Immode&s;ty, and wicked Rant of Plays.</HI> And a little
lower in the &s;ame Page, he mentions <HI>a Collection of all
the wicked, prophane, bla&s;phemous, lewd, impudent, dete&s;t|able
Things that are &s;aid in the Playhou&s;e.</HI> And Page 11,
he &s;peaks of the Entertainment of the Stage, <HI>as it con&s;i&s;ts
of Love-Intrigues, bla&s;phemous Pa&s;&s;ions, prophane Di&s;|cour&s;es,
lewd De&s;criptions, filthy Je&s;ts, and all the mo&s;t ex|travagant
Rant of wanton profligate Per&s;ons of both Sexes;
heating and inflaming one another with all the Wantonne&s;s
of Addre&s;s, the Immode&s;ty of Motion, and the Lewdne&s;s of
Thought, that Wit can invent.</HI></P>
<P>And here I de&s;ire Leave to &s;ay a Word, by the way, in
Defence of Players, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion he very wi&s;ely, hu|manely,
and Chri&s;tianly, makes as unlawful as that of
Robbers. Is he to be told at this Time of Day, that the
Players &s;ay nothing of Them&s;elves? They only &s;peak what
the Poet puts into the Mouths of his univer&s;al allegorical
Fantoms; which Fantoms the Players repre&s;ent. Can this
poor Gentleman be &s;o &s;imple as to believe, that <HI>Reynard,</HI>
<HI>Bruin, I&s;grim,</HI> and <HI>Grimalkin,</HI> &s;ay really of them&s;elves the
<PB N="27" REF="38">
Things that <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> puts into their Mouths? The Players
are only the Poet's In&s;truments, by which he carries on
his Action, and proves his Moral. If any Mu&s;ician &s;ings
a trea&s;onable Song, and plays to it at the &s;ame time, he
ought to &s;uffer for his Crime; but would you indict the
Fiddle or the Flute upon which the Tune is play'd?</P>
<P>What Turn Mr. <HI>Law</HI> de&s;ign'd to &s;erve, by being &s;o pro|fu&s;e
of &s;o much fine Language he be&s;t can tell, tho' we
perhaps may gue&s;s. But he could never po&s;&s;ibly think
of making Poets, or Players, or Spectators, good Chri|&s;tians,
by railing at them for an Hour together, and treat|ing
them wor&s;e than the great Archangel dared to treat
the Devil, <HI>who dur&s;t not bring again&s;t him a railing Ac|cu&s;ation,
but only &s;aid, The Lord rebuke thee.</HI> If he de|&s;ign'd
to convert People by &s;uch a Proceeding, he might
as well pretend to begin a Friend&s;hip with another by abu|&s;ing
him, and throwing Dirt at him.</P>
<P>But to make &s;ome Amends for treating his Fellow-Crea|tures
with &s;o much Antichri&s;tian Language, he u&s;es the
Devil with a great deal of Re&s;pect and Civility. For be|&s;ides
the gentle Terms in which he &s;peaks of him; of his
Honour, of his Glory, of his Joy, his Delight, his Plea|&s;ure,
his peculiar Plea&s;ure; as if Damnation were an ho|nourable
and a happy State; be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, he is
plea&s;ed, out of his great Bounty, to &s;ettle upon him and
his, to have and to hold for ever, the Freehold and Fee-Simple
of all our Theatres. <HI>One may, with the &s;ame A&s;|&s;urance,
affirm,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that the Playhou&s;e, not only when
&s;ome prophane Play is on the Stage, but in its daily common</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="39">
<HI>Entertainments, is as certainly the Hou&s;e of the Devil, as
the Church is the Hou&s;e of God,</HI> Page 12. And a little low|er
in the &s;ame Page, <HI>The Manner and Matter of Stage-En|tertainments,
is as undeniable a Proof, and as obvious to
common Sen&s;e, that the Hou&s;e belongs to the Devil, and is
the Place of his Honour, as the Matter and Manner of
Church Service prove that the Place is appropriated to God.</HI></P>
<P>Now my Opinion is, That if the Devil &s;hould once
become the Head-Landlord of our Theatres, he would im|mediately
turn them into &s;o many <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conventicles:
For tho&s;e are properly his Hou&s;es, tho&s;e are properly his
Temples. For the Sins which the Theatres are accu&s;ed
by Mr. <HI>Law</HI> of encouraging, are not the Devil's Sins, but
our own, the Sins of Men and Women. The Devil neither
drinks nor whores, nor games, nor rants, nor gormandizes.
But the Sins which are carried on in a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conven|ticle,
are the Devil's own Sins; his two great original
Sins, Lying and Rebellion. There all tho&s;e fal&s;e Doc|trines
are carried on, of Hereditary Right, Divine Right,
Indefea&s;ible Right, Ab&s;olute Power, Uncontroulable Pow|er,
Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, Unconditional Obedience; Doc|trines
invented on purpo&s;e to make and flatter Tyrants,
who are the Devil's Viceroys. <HI>For as good Kings are God's
Vicegerents, &s;ure a Tyrant is Hell's Viceroy.</HI> The Place
where the Pretender's Cau&s;e is carried on, is properly the
Temple of the Devil, the original Pretender.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Law</HI> affirms, That the Playhou&s;e is the Sink
of Corruption and Debauchery, Page 15, and that this is
not the State of it, thro' any accidental Abu&s;e, as any in|nocent
<PB N="29" REF="40">
or good Thing may be abu&s;ed, but that Corruption
and Debauchery are the truly natural and genuine Effects
of the Stage Entertainments; is it po&s;&s;ible that he can be
&s;o ignorant as he pretends to make him&s;elf? Can he be
ignorant, that by affirming this, he contradicts what has
been the common Sen&s;e of Mankind for two thou&s;and
Years; and that he contradicts the Opinions and the Judg|ments
of the greate&s;t, and wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t virtuous Men,
of the greate&s;t, and wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t virtuous Nations,
during that va&s;t Space of Time? If Corruption and
Debauchery were the natural and genuine Effects of The|atrical
Entertainments; would they have been encouraged
by the great Legi&s;lators, the mo&s;t learned Philo&s;ophers,
and the wi&s;e&s;t Rulers of the free&s;t States in the World?</P>
<P>No Body knows better than Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> that of all pub|lick
Diver&s;ions, the Drama is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, manly,
noble, and in&s;tructive Diver&s;ion; the excelling in which,
&s;hews the Excellence and the Strength of Genius of that
particular Nation where it appears, and by that Means
advances its Reputation with other Nations, and augments
its Power; and that therefore Dramatick Performances have
been &s;o cheri&s;hed and e&s;teemed by the wi&s;e&s;t Rulers of the
noble&s;t Nations, that they have been maintain'd by the
publick Trea&s;ure; and the Magi&s;trate has not thought it
at all below him, to have the Regulation and the imme|diate
In&s;pection of it: Which is an undeniable Proof, that
they did not at all mi&s;tru&s;t that it was natural to tho&s;e
Entertainments to corrupt and debauch their People.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41">
The Drama is in it&s;elf &s;o excellent, and to excel in it
requires &s;o many great Qualities, that of all the Nations
we hear of among the Ancients, but Two were capable of
proper con&s;tant Theatrical Entertainments; and tho&s;e Two
were the wi&s;e&s;t, brave&s;t, and mo&s;t virtuous of all the Na|tions;
&s;o famous for their great Actions in War, and &s;o
illu&s;trious for the Arts of Peace, that to know what they
were, is become a principal Part of the Learning of us
Moderns; and 'tis accounted &s;candalous in a Gentleman
to be ignorant of what they &s;aid, and wrote, and did;
and yet to know what their Tragick and Comick Poets
were, and what they wrote, is none of the meane&s;t Branches
of that very Learning.</P>
<P>What Opinion the <HI>Grecians</HI> them&s;elves had of their Drama;
how far they believed their Tragick Poets able to in&s;pire
their Countrymen with the Love of their Country, with the
Love of Liberty, of Virtue, and of true Glory, and with
a magnanimous Contempt of Death for the publick Good,
may be gathered from the unanimous Con&s;ent of <HI>Greece,</HI>
and particularly from the Honours done by the <HI>Athenians</HI> to
their Tragick Poets, who made them Governors of Pro|vinces,
Generals of their Armies, and Guardians of the
publick Liberty. For when the <HI>Athenians</HI> &s;ettled a great|er
Fund for the &s;upporting the Magnificence of their Tra|gick
Repre&s;entations, than for the Maintenance of their
Fleets and Armies, we may ju&s;tly conclude that it was
their Opinion, that their Tragick Poets, by con&s;tantly
&s;etting before them the Calamities of Tyrants, defended
them from far more dangerous Enemies than tho&s;e which
their Armies were &s;ent to encounter, and that was from
<PB N="31" REF="42">
their own a&s;piring Citizens. As no People were ever
more jealous of their Liberties than the <HI>Athenians,</HI> none
ever knew better that Corruption and Debauchery are in|con&s;i&s;tent
with Liberty; and therefore it never in the lea&s;t
enter'd into the Thoughts of that great People, that Cor|ruption
and Debauchery were the natural Effects of Dra|matick
Entertainments.</P>
<P>Nor can it be objected with any manner of Ju&s;tice, that
it was the Fury of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Populace, running mad
after their Plea&s;ures, that made them &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;e
the Drama. The greate&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers of
that renown'd Republick declared mo&s;t warmly and mo&s;t
loudly for it. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> writ an admirable Sy&s;tem of Rules
for the compo&s;ing Dramatick Poems, with that Right
Hand that has given us &s;o many excellent Le&s;&s;ons of
Morality. And <HI>Socrates,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t and the mo&s;t virtuous
of all the Philo&s;ophers, who made it the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s
of his Life to in&s;truct his Countrymen in moral Virtue,
did not think it in the lea&s;t below his Wi&s;dom and his
Virtue, to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Euripides</HI> in the writing his Tragedies.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Romans</HI> did not yield to the <HI>Grecians</HI> in the
E&s;teem which they had for Dramatick Entertainments, and
the Belief that they were capable of contributing to the
Glory and the Felicity of a mighty State, and to the Glo|ry
and Felicity of the Authors of them, we may gather
from the Actions of their wi&s;e&s;t State&s;men, their greate&s;t
Captains, and their &s;evere&s;t Philo&s;ophers. Their greate&s;t
Captains and their wi&s;e&s;t State&s;men not only encouraged
Dramatick Poems, but vouch&s;afed to write them them|&s;elves.
<PB N="32" REF="43">
<HI>Scipio,</HI> the wi&s;e, the virtuous <HI>Scipio,</HI> writ Come|dy
with that conquering Hand that won the Empire of the
World at <HI>Zama. Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> as famous for the Arts
of Peace as his Succe&s;s in War, renown'd for the whol&s;ome
Laws he enacted, and for his reforming the Manners of
the People, begun the Tragedy of <HI>Ajax,</HI> tho' he could not
fini&s;h it; but found it ea&s;ier to make him&s;elf Emperor of
the World, than a great Dramatick Poet. <HI>Cicero,</HI> the Cham|pion
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Liberties, in twenty Places of his Phi|lo&s;ophick
Treati&s;es, quotes the <HI>Roman</HI> Tragick Poets.
And <HI>Seneca,</HI> who thro' the Opinion which <HI>Agrippina</HI> had
of the Strictne&s;s and the Severity of his Virtue, was in|tru&s;ted
with the Education of a Prince, upon who&s;e Con|duct
the Happine&s;s of Mankind depended; <HI>Seneca,</HI> who,
by &s;o many admirable Le&s;&s;ons of moral Virtue, has obliged
all the Lovers of Wit and Virtue for ever, did not think
writing Tragedy an Employment at all below him.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> I appeal to you, whether it does not logi|cally
and nece&s;&s;arily follow, from what has been &s;aid,
that either Mr. <HI>Law</HI> mu&s;t believe, that the Great Men a|mong
the ancient <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> their Captains,
State&s;men, and Philo&s;ophers, wanted common Sen&s;e; or he
cannot po&s;&s;ibly believe, that Corruption and Debauchery
are the natural Effects of Theatrical Entertainments; and
con&s;equently mu&s;t be guilty of very vile Hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>There remains another &s;trong Pre&s;umption of Hypocri&s;y
again&s;t Mr. <HI>Law.</HI> For what is Mr. <HI>Law?</HI> And what are
his two Predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Collier</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> who attack'd the
Stage before him? Why <HI>Jacabite</HI> Nonjuring Par&s;ons all
<PB N="33" REF="44">
three of them, who have di&s;own'd our E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,
and di&s;own'd our Government. How come they to take
up this great Concern for our Salvation in a Matter about
which all our Pa&s;tors, who have the immediate Care of
our Souls, are &s;ilent? Have they more Capacity to &s;ee the
enormous Crimes of Theaters, and the pretended fatal
Con&s;equences of them, than &s;o many great and good Men,
who have been the exalted Lights of the Church &s;ince the
Re&s;toration? No, all the World knows, that there is not
the lea&s;t Pretence for it, nor the lea&s;t Compari&s;on. Have
they more true Zeal and Concern for the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion?
No, that, as we ob&s;erved above, is incon&s;i&s;tent
with their Manner of treating us. The Language of <HI>Bil|ling&s;gate</HI>
can never be the Language of Charity, nor con|&s;equently
of Chri&s;tianity. Truth has not the impetuous
&s;tormy Air which Mr. <HI>Law</HI> a&s;&s;umes, but comes in the &s;oft
and &s;till Voice, like the God who in&s;pires it; and Truth
dete&s;ts and abominates the Equivocating and Prevaricating
of Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>But now let us con&s;ider the Time that the&s;e People have
cho&s;e to exert their pretended Zeal. It has been always
when &s;omething has been about to be done, which it was
thought might prove favourable to the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> publi&s;h'd his <HI>Short View</HI> when <HI>France</HI> declar'd for
the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> upon the Death of <HI>James</HI> II. and his <HI>Di&s;|&s;ua&s;ive,</HI>
upon the great Storm, when the great Deva&s;tation
which that Huricane wrought, had amaz'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd
the Minds of Men, and made them obnoxious to melan|cholly
and de&s;ponding Thoughts. I formerly expos'd the
egregious hypocritical Folly of making that Storm a Divine
<PB N="34" REF="45">
Judgment upon the Nation for the Enormities of our
Theatres. Mr. <HI>Law</HI> has taken the Opportunity to attack
the Stage, upon the great Preparations which he heard
were making abroad, and which the <HI>Jacobites</HI> flatter'd
them&s;elves were de&s;ign'd in their Favour. As for Mr.
<HI>Bedford</HI>'s <HI>Serious Remon&s;trance,</HI> tho' I know nothing of
the Time of publi&s;hing it, yet I dare to lay Odds it was
either upon the Duke <HI>D'Aumont</HI>'s being at <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI>
or upon the late Rebellion. Now all the&s;e Attacks
upon the Stage have been Attacks upon the Government,
and tho&s;e three worthy Per&s;ons &s;eem to me to have been
at the Beck of &s;ome certain Superiors, and always ready
at their Command to divert the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
from their real Danger, by giving them Alarms in a wrong
Place.</P>
