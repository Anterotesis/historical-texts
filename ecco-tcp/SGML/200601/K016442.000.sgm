<P>IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am &s;ure No-body can di&s;pute mine. I own my &s;elf of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their weekly Fe|&s;tivals at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s.

<P>As we live by the Mu&s;es, 'tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit where-ever we find it. The Mu&s;es, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no Di&s;tinction to Drels, and never partially mi&s;take the Pertne&s;s of Em|broidery for Wit, nor the Mode&s;ty of Want for Dulne&s;s.

<P>This Piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of <HI>James Chari|ter</HI> and <HI>Moll Lay,</HI> two mo&s;t excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introduc'd the Similes that are in all your celebrated <HI>Operas</HI>: The <HI>Swallow,</HI> the <HI>Moth,</HI> the <HI>Bee,</HI> the <HI>Ship,</HI> the <HI>Flower,</HI> &amp;c. Be|&s;ides, I have a Pri&s;on Scene which the Ladies reckon charmingly pathetick. As to the Parts, I have ob&s;erv'd &s;uch a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for either of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgi|ven, that I have not made my Opera through|out unnatural, like tho&s;e in vogue; for I have no Recitative: Excepting this, as I have con|&s;ented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue, it mu&s;t be allow'd an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently re|pre&s;ented by our &s;elves in our great Room at St, <HI>Giles</HI>'s, &s;o that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.</P>

'Twould have &s;hown that the lower Sort of People have their Vices in a degree as well as the Rich: And that they are puni&s;h'd for them.</P>
