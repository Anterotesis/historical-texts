<P>CHARLES, here are more &s;tories for you,&mdash;&s;tories about good boys, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">
naughty boys, and &s;illy boys; for you know what it is to be good now. And there is a &s;tory about two fooli&s;h Cocks that were always quarrelling, which is very naughty. You do not quarrel? No. I am glad of it; but if you &s;ee any little boys that quarrel you may tell
<PB N="5" REF="4">
them the &s;tory of the Two Cocks. This is it:</P>
<P>There was once a Hen who lived in a farm-yard, and &s;he had a large brood of chickens. She took a great deal of care of them, and gathered them under her wings every night, and fed them, and nur&s;ed them
<PB N="6" REF="5">
very well: and they were all very good, except two Cocks, that were always quarrelling with one another. They were hardly out of the &s;hell before they began to peck at each other; and when they grew bigger they fought till they were all bloody. If one picked
<PB N="7" REF="6">
up a barley-corn the other always wanted to have it. They never looked pretty, be|cau&s;e their feathers were pulled off in fighting till they were quite bare; and they picked at one another's eyes till they were both almo&s;t blind. The old Hen very often told them
<PB N="8" REF="7">
how naughty it was to quarrel &s;o; but they did not mind her.</P>
<P>So one day the&s;e two Cocks had been fighting, as they al|ways did; and the bigge&s;t Cock, who&s;e name was Chan|ticleer, beat the other, and crowed over him, and drove
<PB N="9" REF="8">
him quite out of the yard. The Cock that had been beat &s;lunk away and hid him&s;elf; for he was vexed he had been conquered, and he wanted &s;adly to be revenged; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">id not know how to manage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, for he was not &s;trong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ough him&s;elf. So, after
<PB N="10" REF="9">
thinking a great deal, he went to an old &s;ly Fox that lived near, and &s;aid to him, Fox, if you will come with me I will &s;hew you where there is a large fat Cock in a farm-yard, and you may cat him up if you will. The Fox was very glad, for he was
<PB N="11" REF="10">
hungry enough; and he &s;aid, Yes, I will come with all my heart, and I will not leave a feather of him. So they went together, and the Cock &s;hewed Reynard the way into the farm-yard; and there was poor Chanticleer a&s;leep upon the perch. And
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the Fox &s;eized him by the neck, and ate him up; and the other Cock &s;tood by and crowed for joy. But when the Fox had done, he &s;aid, Chanticleer was very good, but I have not had enough; and &s;o he flew upon the other
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Cock, and ate him up too in a moment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I will tell you a &s;tory.</P>
<P>There was a little boy who&s;e name was Harry; and his papa and mamma &s;ent
<PB N="14" REF="13">
him to &s;chool. Now Harry was a clever fellow, and loved his book; and he got to be fir&s;t in his cla&s;s. So his mamma got up one morning very early and called Betty the maid, and &s;aid, Betty, I think we mu&s;t make a cake for Harry, for he
<PB N="15" REF="14">
has learned his book very well. And Betty &s;aid, Yes, with all my heart. So they made a nice cake. It was very large, and &s;tuffed full of plums and &s;weetmeats, orange and citron; and it was iced all over with &s;ugar: it was white and &s;mooth on
<PB N="16" REF="15">
the top like &s;now. So this cake was &s;ent to the &s;chool. When little Harry &s;aw it he was very glad, and jump|ed about for joy, and he hardly &s;tayed for a knife to cut a piece, but gnawed it like a little dog. So he ate till the bell rang for &s;chool, and
<PB N="17" REF="16">
after &s;chool he ate again, and ate till he went to bed; nay, his bed-fellow told me that he laid his cake under his pillow, and &s;at up in the night to eat &s;ome. So he ate till it was all gone.&mdash;But pre&s;ently after this little boy was very &s;ick and ill,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and every body &s;aid, I won|der what is the matter with Harry&mdash;he u&s;ed to be &s;o bri&s;k, and play about more nimbly than any of the boys; and now he looks pale and is very ill. And &s;omebody &s;aid, Harry has had a rich cake, and eat it all up very
<PB N="19" REF="18">
&s;oon, and that has made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. So they &s;ent for Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">amomile, and he gave him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> do not know how much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">tter &s;tuff. Poor Harry did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> like it at all, but he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rced to take it, or el&s;e he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ould have died, you know. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at la&s;t he got well again,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
but his mamma &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> would &s;end him no mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> cakes.</P>
<P>Now there was anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> boy, who was one of Harry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;chool-fellows: his name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Peter; the boys u&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> call him Peter Careful. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Peter had written his mam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> very neat pretty letter&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ere was not one blot in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> all. So his mamma &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a cake. Now Peter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ought with him&s;elf, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ot make my&s;elf &s;ick with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">is good cake, as &s;illy Harry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">id; I will keep it a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">hile. So he took the cake,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
and tugged it up &s;tairs. I was very heavy: he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> hardly carry it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> locked it up in his box, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> once a day he crept &s;lily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tairs, and ate a very litt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> piece, and then locked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> box again. So he kept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal weeks, and it was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">one, for it was very large; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ut, behold! the mice got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nto his box and nibbled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ome. And the cake grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ry and mouldy, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">a&s;t was good for nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> all. So he was obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> throw it away, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rieved him to the very heart,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
and no body was &s;orry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> him.</P>
<P>Well; there was anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> little boy at the &s;ame &s;choo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> who&s;e name was Billy. And one day his mamma &s;ent him a cake, becau&s;e &s;he love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> him dearly, and he loved he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> dearly. So when the cak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="25" REF="24">
ame, Billy &s;aid to his &s;chool|fellows I have got a cake, come let us go and eat it. So they came about him like a parcel of bees; and Billy took a &s;lice of cake him&s;elf, and then gave a piece to one, and a piece to another, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> piece to another, till it was
<PB N="26" REF="25">
almo&s;t gone. Then Billy put the re&s;t by, and &s;aid, I will eat it to-morrow. So he went to play, and the boys all played together very mer|rily. But pre&s;ently after an old blind Fiddler came into the court: he had a long white beard; and, becau&s;e he
<PB N="27" REF="26">
was blind, he had a little dog in a &s;tring to lead him. So he came into the court, and &s;at down upon a &s;tone, and &s;aid, My pretty lads, if you will, I will play you a tune. And they all left off their &s;port, and came and &s;tood round him. And
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Billy &s;aw that while he play|ed the tears ran down his cheeks. And Billy &s;aid, Old man, why do you cry? And the old man &s;aid, Becau&s;e I am very hungry&mdash;I have no|body to give me any din|ners or &s;uppers&mdash;I have no|thing in the world but this
<PB N="29" REF="28">
little dog; and I cannot work. If I could work I would. Then Billy went without &s;aying a word, and fetched the re&s;t of his cake which he had intended to have eaten another day, and he &s;aid, Here, old man! here is &s;ome cake for you. The
<PB N="30" REF="29">
old man &s;aid, Where is it? for I am blind, I cannot &s;ee it. So Billy put it into his hat. And the Fiddler thank|ed him, and Billy was more glad than if he had eaten ten cakes.</P>
<P>Pray which do you love
<PB N="31" REF="30">
be&s;t? do you love Harry, or Peter, or Billy be&s;t?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Little boy, come to me. Tell me how far from home have you been in your life? I think I &s;hould like to go a great long way with you,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
and &s;ee what we could &s;ee: for there are a great many places in the world be&s;ides home. Bring your hat. Good-bye, Papa. Farewell, Billy, and Harry, and every body. We are going a great way off. And we &s;hall go down the lane, and through
<PB N="33" REF="32">
the church-yard, and by the corner hou&s;e, and over the &s;tile, till we have got quite into the fields. How pretty the fields will look! for it will be &s;ummer days again before we go. And there will be yellow flowers, and white flowers, and gra&s;s,
<PB N="34" REF="33">
and trees, and hedges; and the gra&s;shoppers will chirp, chirp, under our feet. Do not try to catch them; it will only hinder us, and we have a great way to go.</P>
<P>Pray what are tho&s;e pretty creatures that look &s;o meek and good-natured, and have
<PB N="35" REF="34">
&s;oft thick white wool upon their backs, like a great coat, and make a noi&s;e like the little baby when it cries? Tho&s;e are &s;heep and lambs. And what are tho&s;e creatures with horns, that are bigger than the &s;heep? Some of them are black, and &s;ome
<PB N="36" REF="35">
red: they make a loud noi&s;e, but they do not look as if they would hurt any body. Tho&s;e are cows that give milk. Stroke them. Poor cows! Stand &s;till and look back. Now we cannot &s;ee papa's hou&s;e at all; and we can &s;ee only the top of the
<PB N="37" REF="36">
church &s;teeple. Let us go a little farther. Now look back. Now we cannot &s;ee the church at all. Farewell! We are going a great way. Shall we ever come back again? Yes, we &s;hall come back again; but we mu&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="37">
go on now. Come, make ha&s;te.</P>
<P>What is that tall thing that has four great arms which move very fa&s;t? I believe if I was near it they would &s;trike me down. It is a Wind-mill. Tho&s;e arms are the &s;ails. The wind
<PB N="39" REF="38">
turns them round. And what is a wind-mill for? It is to grind corn. You could have no bread if the corn were not ground. Well, but here is a river: how &s;hall we do to get over it? Why do not you &s;ee how tho&s;e ducks do? they &s;wim over.
<PB N="40" REF="39">
But I cannot &s;wim. Then you mu&s;t learn to &s;wim, I believe: it is too wide to jump over. O here is a Bridge! Somebody has made a bridge for us quite over the river. That &s;omebody was very good, for I do not know what we &s;hould have
<PB N="41" REF="40">
done without it; and he was very clever too. I wonder now he made it. I am &s;ure I could not make &s;uch a bridge.</P>
<P>Well, we mu&s;t go on, on, on; and we &s;hall &s;ee more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ivers, and more fields, and owns bigger than our town
<PB N="42" REF="41">
a great deal&mdash;large towns, and fine churches, &s;treets and people&mdash;more than there is at the fair. And we &s;hall have a great many high hills to climb. I believe I mu&s;t get &s;omebody to carry the little boy up tho&s;e high hills. And &s;ometimes we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="43" REF="42">
through du&s;ty &s;andy roads; and &s;ometimes through green <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">anes, where we &s;hall hear the birds &s;ing. Sometimes we &s;hall go over wide com|mons, where we &s;hall &s;ee no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rees, nor any hou&s;e; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">arge heaths, where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> hardly any gra&s;s&mdash;only
<PB N="44" REF="43">
&s;ome purple flowers, and a few black no&s;ed little &s;heep. Ha! did you &s;ee that pretty brown creature that ran acro&s;s the path? Here is another; and look! there is another: there are a great many. They are Rabbits. They live here, and make them&s;elves hou&s;es
<PB N="45" REF="44">
in the ground. This is a rabbit-warren.</P>
<P>Now we are come among&s;t a great many trees&mdash;more trees than there are in the orchard by a great many; and taller trees. There is oak, and a&s;h, and elm. This is a Wood. What great
<PB N="46" REF="45">
boughs the trees have! like thick arms. The &s;un can|not &s;hine among&s;t the trees, they are &s;o thick. Look, there is a &s;quirrel! jumping from one tree to another. He is very nimble. What a pret|ty tail he has!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">
Well; when we have gone on a great many days, through a great many fields and towns, we &s;hall come to a great deep water, bigger a great many times than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">iver, for you can &s;ee over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">he river, you know&mdash;you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">an &s;ee fields on the other
<PB N="48" REF="47">
&s;ide: but this is &s;o large, and &s;o wide, you can &s;ee nothing but water, water, as far as ever you can carry your eyes. And it is not &s;mooth, like the river; it is all rough, like the great pot in the kitchen when it is boiling. And it is &s;o deep
<PB N="49" REF="48">
it would drown you if you were as tall as two church &s;teeples. I wonder what they call this great water! there is an old, old fi&s;her|man, &s;itting upon a &s;tone drying him&s;elf; for he is very wet. I think we will a&s;k him. Pray, fi&s;herman,
<PB N="50" REF="49">
what is this great water? It is the Sea: did you never hear of the &s;ea? What! is this great water the &s;ame &s;ea that is in our map at home? Yes, it is. Well, this is very &s;trange! we are come to the &s;ea that is in our map. But it is very little in the
<PB N="51" REF="50">
map. I can lay my finger over it. Yes; it is little in the map, becau&s;e every thing is little in the map: the towns are little, and the rivers are little.</P>
<P>Pray, Fi&s;herman, is there any thing on the other &s;ide of this &s;ea? Yes; fields,
<PB N="52" REF="51">
and towns, and people. Will you go and &s;ee them? I &s;hould like to go very well; but how mu&s;t we do to get over? for there is no bridge here. Do not you &s;ee tho&s;e great wooden boxes that &s;wim upon the water? They are bigger than all papa's
<PB N="53" REF="52">
hou&s;e. There are tall poles in the middle, as high as a tree. Tho&s;e are ma&s;ts. See! now they are &s;pread|ing the &s;ails. Tho&s;e white &s;heets are the &s;ails. They are like wings. The&s;e wooden boxes are like hou&s;es with wings. Yes, and I will
<PB N="54" REF="53">
tell you what, little boy! they are made on purpo&s;e to go over the &s;ea; and the wind blows them along fa&s;ter than a hor&s;e can trot. What do they call them? They call them Ships. You have &s;een a &s;hip in a picture. Shall we get in? What have
<PB N="55" REF="54">
tho&s;e men in the &s;hip got on? they have jackets and trow|&s;ers on, and checked &s;hirts. They are &s;ailors. I think we will make you a &s;ailor; and then in&s;tead of breeches you mu&s;t have a pair of trow&s;ers. Do you &s;ee that &s;ailor, how he climbs up the
<PB N="56" REF="55">
ropes? He is very nimble. He runs up like a monkey. Now he is at the top of the ma&s;t. How little he looks! But we mu&s;t get in. Come, make ha&s;te: they will not &s;tay for us. What are you doing? picking up &s;hells! We mu&s;t get into a boat
<PB N="57" REF="56">
fir&s;t, becau&s;e the &s;hip is not near enough. Now we are in.</P>
<P>Now we are upon the great &s;ea. Blow, blow wind! Sail away &s;hip! There are little rooms in the &s;hip. Tho&s;e little rooms are called cabins. Let us walk about,
<PB N="58" REF="57">
and look at the &s;hip. Why, you cannot walk &s;teady: I am afraid you are tip&s;y! Be|cau&s;e the &s;hip rolls about. But the &s;ailors can walk &s;teady. The &s;ea is not like the river; it is greeni&s;h. Well; here is water enough if we &s;hould be thir&s;ty. Yes, here
<PB N="59" REF="58">
is water enough; but you would not like to drink it. It is &s;alt and bitter. You could not drink it. How fa&s;t we go! Now the fields are a great way off. Now we cannot &s;ee any green fields at all, nor any hou&s;es, nor any thing but the great
<PB N="60" REF="59">
deep water. It is water all round as far as ever we can &s;ee. Yes, and &s;ky; we can &s;ee the &s;ky too. All &s;ky over our heads, and all water every where round us! Do not be afraid, little boy! Blow, blow, wind! &s;ail away &s;hip! I &s;ee &s;ome
<PB N="61" REF="60">
things in the &s;ea at a great di&s;tance. Tho&s;e are more &s;hips and boats. How very &s;mall they are! they look like nut &s;hells in a great pond. O, Now we are com|ing to the green fields and towns on the other &s;ide of the &s;ea! I can &s;ee them a
<PB N="62" REF="61">
little. Now I can &s;ee them very plain. And here is a little piece of green land, with the water running all round it. That is an i&s;land. A piece of land with water all round it, is an i&s;land. But we are not going there; we are going to the great land.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="62">
Now we are at the land, Get out of the &s;hip. Pray what country is this? This is France. France! why France is in the map too. And pray what is the name of that country we came from, where we live, and where papa lives? It is
<PB N="64" REF="63">
England. And the deep &s;ea is between France and Eng|land? Yes, you know it is &s;o in the map.</P>
<P>O, France is a pretty place It is warmer than our coun|try: and here are pretty flowers, and fine fruit, and large grapes. I never &s;aw
<PB N="65" REF="64">
&s;uch large grapes in all my life. And the vines grow in the fields; they do not grow again&s;t walls, as our vines do. And there are a great many people, men, and wo|men, and little boys and girls, &s;inging, and dancing about, and &s;o merry! no|thing

can be like it. I think we will live here, and &s;end for papa and Arthur. Let us go and talk with tho&s;e people.

what <HI>Serviteur Mon&s;ieur</HI> is, It is French. But we do not under&s;tand French. I can|not help that; you mu&s;t go home and learn. And why do you &s;peak French? Be|cau&s;e this is France. Did not you know that every body &s;peaks French in

France? Ha, ha, ha! He he, he! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Here is a fooli&s;h little boy come a great way over the &s;ea, and does not know that every body &s;peaks French in France. Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho! Here is a fooli&s;h little boy

<P>You know how many legs a Hor&s;e has? Yes, a Hor&s;e has four legs. And do you know what an ani|mal is called that has four
<PB N="73" REF="72">
legs? It is called a Qua|druped. The Cow is a quadruped; and the Dog, and the Lion, and all the bea&s;ts. But birds are not quadrupeds, for they have only two legs. Some qua|drupeds have hoofs. The Hor&s;e has hoofs; &s;o has the
<PB N="74" REF="73">
A&s;s, and the Cow: but the Dog has no hoofs; the Dog has toes with claws; &s;o the Dog is not hoofed, but digi|tated; and the Cat, and the Squirrel, and a great many more are digitated. The hoof of the hor&s;e is whole, it is all in one piece;
<PB N="75" REF="74">
but the hoof of the Cow is parted, as if it were two hoofs. That is being clo|ven-footed; the hoof is clo|ven. The Cow, and the Sheep, and the Hog, and the Stag, are all cloven-footed; but the Hor&s;e, and the A&s;s, have whole hoofs.</P>

<P>The A&s;s &s;ays, I am a Quadruped; I am a very patient good creature. I have hoofs, and very long ears: I bray very loud. The hor&s;e is frightened when I bray, and &s;tarts back; but
<PB N="77" REF="76">
I am very meek, and never hurt any thing. My young ones are colts: I &s;uckle them. I am not &s;o big as a hor&s;e, and I cannot gallop fa&s;t, but I work very hard. Sometimes I carry little boys on my back, two or three at a time, and they whip
<PB N="78" REF="77">
me, and prick my &s;ides, to make me go fa&s;ter. I carry greens to market, and tur|nips, and potatoes; and &s;ometimes I carry a great load of pans, and mugs, and pots, with which my back is almo&s;t broke; and I get nothing for my dinner but
<PB N="79" REF="78">
a few prickly thi&s;tles, and &s;ome coar&s;e gra&s;s from off the common: and I have no &s;table to go into as a Hor&s;e has; I always lie out in the fields, in the &s;now, and in the rain; but I am very con|tented. I give milk as well as the Cow; and my milk is
<PB N="80" REF="79">
very good for people that are &s;ick, to make them well again.</P>

<P>Ha! what is there among&s;t the furze? I can &s;ee only its eyes. It has very large full eyes. It is a Hare. It
<PB N="81" REF="80">
is in its form, &s;quatting down among&s;t the bu&s;hes to hide it&s;elf, for it is very fearful. The Hare is very innocent and gentle. Its colour is brown; but in countries which are very cold it turns white as &s;now. It has a &s;hort bu&s;hy tail; its lip
<PB N="82" REF="81">
is parted, and very hairy; and it always moves its lips. Its hind egs are very long, that it may run the better. The Hare feeds upon herbs, and roots, and the bark of young trees, and green corn; and &s;ometimes it will creep through the hedge, and &s;teal
<PB N="83" REF="82">
into the gardens, to eat pinks and a little par&s;ley; and it loves to play and &s;kip about by moon-light, and to bite the tender blades of gra&s;s when the dew is up|on them; but in the day|time it &s;leeps in its form. It &s;leeps with its eyes open
<PB N="84" REF="83">
becau&s;e it is very fearful and timid; and when it hears the lea&s;t noi&s;e it &s;tarts and pricks up its large ears. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the hunt&s;man &s;ounds his horn, and the poor harm|le&s;s Hare hears the Dogs com|ing, then it it runs away very &s;wiftly &s;traight forward, &s;tretch|ing
<PB N="85" REF="84">
its legs, and leaves them all behind. But the Dogs pur&s;ue her, and &s;he grows tired, and cannot run &s;o fa&s;t as at fir&s;t. Then &s;he doubles, and turns, and runs back to her form, that the hounds may not find her; but they run with their
<PB N="86" REF="85">
no&s;es to the ground, &s;mel|ling till they have found her out. So when &s;he has run five or &s;ix miles, at la&s;t &s;he &s;tops, and pants for breath, and can run no fur|ther. Then the hounds come up, and tear her, and kill her. Then when &s;he
<PB N="87" REF="86">
is dead, her little limbs which moved &s;o fa&s;t, grow quite &s;tiff, and cannot move at all. A &s;nail could go fa&s;ter than a hare when it is dead: and its poor little heart, that beat &s;o quick, is quite &s;till and cold; and its round full eyes are dull and dim;
<PB N="88" REF="87">
and its &s;oft furry &s;kin is all torn and bloody. It is good for nothing now but to be roa&s;ted.</P>

<P>All birds that &s;wim in the water are web-footed. Their toes are joined together by

lakes. I eat plants that grow in the water, and &s;eeds, and little infects, and &s;nails. I do not look pretty when I walk upon the ground, for I cannot walk well at all; but when I am in the water, &s;wimming &s;moothly along, arching my long neck, and
<PB N="92" REF="91">
dipping my white brea&s;t, with which I make way through the water, I am the mo&s;t graceful of all birds. I build my ne&s;t in a little i&s;land among&s;t the reeds and ru&s;hes. I make it of &s;ticks and long gra&s;s: it is very large and high. Then I lay

my eggs, which are white, and very large, larger a great deal than a goo&s;e's egg; and I &s;it upon them for two months; then they are hatched, and my young ones come out. They are called cygnets. They are not white at fir&s;t, but grey|i&s;h.

If any body was to come near me when I am in my ne&s;t, &s;itting upon my eggs, or when I have my young ones, I &s;hould fly at him; for I am very fierce to defend my young: and if you were to come to take them away, I &s;hould beat

<P>The Sun &s;ays, My name is Sun: I am very bright. I ri&s;e in the ea&s;t; and when

read, and walk about. I am a great traveller, I travel all over the &s;ky; I never &s;top, and I never am tired. I have a crown upon my head of bright beams, and I &s;end forth my rays every where. I &s;hine upon the trees and the hou&s;es, and upon the

&s;hould dazzle your eyes, and make you blind. Only the Eagle can look at me then: the Eagle with his &s;trong piercing eye can gaze upon me always. And when I am going to ri&s;e in the morning and make it day, the Lark flies up in the &s;ky
