I know Your Lady&s;hip de|lights

which give &s;uch a Bloom to
the Mind, as the Prime of

Had I, therefore, been
able to make this Tragedy
(which, I humbly reque&s;t,
may appear under Your Lady|&s;hip's
Protection) as Com|pleat,
as it is Innocent; It
might have proved a la&s;ting

<PB REF="7">
for &s;uch Ob|ligations,
as I can never forget,
nor di&s;own.</P>
<P>I have had the Honour,
though I live concealed in
the utmo&s;t Privacy of Life,
long to enjoy Your Lady|&s;hip's
Favour. If You are
plea&s;ed to pardon this pub|lick
Declaration of my Grati|tude;
what has been the &s;e|cret
