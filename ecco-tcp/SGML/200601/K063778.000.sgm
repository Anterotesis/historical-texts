<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>1 CORINTHIANS, ix.&mdash;Part of the 27th Ver&s;e.</BIBL> "Le&s;t that, by any means, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words di&s;cover the anxiety, not to &s;ay the fears of the writer, concerning the event of his per&s;onal &s;alvation: and, when interpreted by the words which precede them, &s;trictly connect that event with the purity of his per&s;onal character.</P>
<P>It is extremely material to remember, who it was that felt this deep &s;olicitude for the fate of his &s;piritual intere&s;ts, and the per&s;ua&s;ion, that his acceptance (in&s;ofar as it is pro|cured by human endeavours) would depend upon the care and exactne&s;s, with which he regulated his own pa&s;&s;ions, and his own conduct: becau&s;e, if a man ever exi&s;ted, who, in the
<PB N="8" REF="5">
zeal and labour with which he &s;erved the cau&s;e of religion, in the ardour or the efficacy of his preaching, in his &s;ufferings or his &s;ucce&s;s, might hope for &s;ome excu&s;e to indulgence, &s;ome li|cence for gratifications which were forbidden to others, it was the author of the text which has been now read to you. Yet the Apo&s;tle appears to have known, and by his knowledge teaches us, that no exertion of indu&s;try, no di&s;play of talents, no public merit, however great, or however good or &s;acred be the cau&s;e in which it is acquired, will compen&s;ate for the ne|glect of per&s;onal &s;elf-government.</P>
<P>This, in my opinion, is an important le&s;&s;on to all: to none, certainly, can it be more applicable, than it is in every age to the teachers of religion: for a little ob&s;ervation of the world mu&s;t have informed us, that the human mind is prone, almo&s;t beyond re&s;i&s;tance, to &s;ink the weakne&s;s or the irregularities of private character in the view of public &s;ervices; that this pro|pen&s;ity is the &s;tronge&s;t in a man's own ca&s;e; that it prevails more powerfully in religion than in other &s;ubjects, ina&s;much as the teachers of religion con&s;ider them&s;elves (and rightly do &s;o) as mini&s;tering to the higher intere&s;ts of human exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Still farther, if there be cau&s;es, as I believe there are, which rai&s;e extraordinary difficulties in the way of tho&s;e, who are engaged in the offices of religion; circum&s;tances even of di&s;|advantage in the pro&s;e&s;&s;ion and character, as far as relates to
<PB N="9" REF="6">
the con&s;ervation of their own virtue; it behoves them to adopt the apo&s;tle's caution with more than common care, becau&s;e it is only to prepare them&s;elves for dangers, to which they are, more than commonly, expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor is there good rea&s;on for concealing, either from our|&s;elves or others, any unfavourable di&s;po&s;itions which the nature of our employment or &s;ituation may tend to generate: for, be they what they will, they only prove, that it happens to us, according to the condition of human life, with many benefits to receive &s;ome inconveniences; with many helps to experi|ence &s;ome trials; that with many peculiar motives to virtue, and means of improvement in it, &s;ome ob&s;tacles are pre&s;ented to our progre&s;s, which it may require a di&s;tinct and po&s;itive effort of the mind to &s;urmount.</P>
<P>I apprehend, that I am &s;tating a cau&s;e of no incon&s;iderable importance, when, among&s;t the&s;e impediments, I mention, in the fir&s;t place, the in&s;en&s;ibility to religious impre&s;&s;ion, which a con&s;tant conver&s;ation with religious &s;ubjects, and, &s;till more, a con&s;tant intermixture with religious offices, is wont to in|duce. Such is the frame of the human con&s;titution (and cal|culated al&s;o for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es) that, whil&s;t all active habits are facilitated and &s;trengthened by repetition, impre&s;&s;ions under which we are pa&s;&s;ive, are weakened and dimini&s;hed. Upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e properties depends in a great mea&s;ure
<PB N="10" REF="7">
the exerci&s;e of the arts of life; upon the &s;econd, the capacity which the mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of adapting it&s;elf to almo&s;t every &s;ituation. This quality is perceived in numerous, and, for the mo&s;t part, beneficial examples. Scenes of terror, &s;pectacles of pain, objects of loathing and di&s;gu&s;t, &s;o far lo&s;e their effect with their novelty, as to permit profe&s;&s;ions to be carried on, and conditions of life to be endured, which otherwi&s;e, although nece&s;&s;ary, would be in&s;upportable. It is a quality however, which acts, as other parts of our frame do, by an operation which is general: hence it acts al&s;o in in&s;tances in which its influence is to be corrected; and, among&s;t the&s;e, in religion. Every attentive chri&s;tian will have ob&s;erved, how much more powerfully he is affected by any form of wor&s;hip which is uncommon, than with the familiar returns of his own reli|gious offices. He will be &s;en&s;ible of the difference, when he approaches, a few times in the year, the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper; if he &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the vi&s;itation of the &s;ick; or even, if that were unu&s;ual to him, at the &s;ight of a family a&s;&s;embled in prayer. He will perceive it al&s;o upon en|tering the doors of a di&s;&s;enting congregation; a circum&s;tance which has mi&s;led many, by cau&s;ing them to a&s;cribe to &s;ome advantage in the conduct of public wor&s;hip, what, in truth, is only the effect of new impre&s;&s;ions. Now, by how much a lay frequenter of religious wor&s;hip finds him&s;elf le&s;s warmed
<PB N="11" REF="8">
and &s;timulated by ordinary than by extraordinary acts of devo|tion, by &s;o much, it may be expected, that a clergyman, ha|bitually conver&s;ant with the offices of religion, will be le&s;s moved and &s;timulated than he is. What then is to be done? It is by an effort of reflection; by a po&s;itive exertion of the mind; by knowing this tendency, and by &s;etting our&s;elves ex|pre&s;sly to re&s;i&s;t it, that we are to repair the decays of &s;ponta|neous piety. We are no more to &s;urrender our&s;elves to the mechani&s;m of our frame, than to the impul&s;e of our pa&s;&s;ions. We are to a&s;&s;i&s;t our &s;en&s;itive, by our rational nature. We are to &s;upply this infirmity (for &s;o it may be called, although like many other properties, which bear the name of vices in our con&s;titution, it be, in truth, a beneficial principle acting ac|cording to a general law)&mdash;we are to &s;upply it, by a deeper &s;en&s;e of the obligations under which we lie; by a more fre|quent and a more di&s;tinct recollection of the rea&s;ons upon which that obligation is founded. We are not to wonder at the pains which this may co&s;t us: &s;till le&s;s, are we to imitate the de&s;pondency of &s;ome &s;erious chri&s;tians, who, in the im|paired &s;en&s;ibility that habit hath induced, bewail the coldne&s;s of a de&s;erted &s;oul.</P>
<P>Hitherto our ob&s;ervation will not be que&s;tioned: but I think that this principle goes farther than is generally known or ac|knowledged. I think that it extends to the influence, which
<PB N="12" REF="9">
argument it&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es upon our under&s;tanding; or at lea&s;t to the influence which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in determining our will. I will not &s;ay, that in a &s;ubject &s;trictly intellectual, and in &s;cience properly &s;o called, a demon&s;tration is the le&s;s convincing for being old: but I am not &s;ure, that this is not, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, true of moral evidence and probable proofs. In practical &s;ubjects however, where two things are to be done, the under|&s;tanding to be convinced, and the will to be per&s;uaded, I be|lieve that the force of every argument is dimini&s;hed by tritene&s;s and familiarity. The intrin&s;ic value of the argument mu&s;t be the &s;ame; the impre&s;&s;ion may be very different.</P>
<P>But <HI>we</HI> have a di&s;advantage to contend with, additional to this. The con&s;equence of repetition will be felt more &s;en&s;ibly by us, who are in the habit of directing our arguments to others: for it always requires a &s;econd, a &s;eparate, and an unu&s;ual effort of the mind, to bring back the conclu&s;ion upon our&s;elves. In con&s;tructing, in expre&s;&s;ing, in delivering our arguments; in all the thoughts and &s;tudy which we employ upon them, what we are apt to hold continually in our view, is the effect which they may produce upon tho&s;e who hear or read them. The further and be&s;t u&s;e of our meditations, their influence upon our own hearts and con&s;ciences, is lo&s;t in the pre&s;ence of the other. In philo&s;ophy it&s;elf, it is not always the &s;ame thing, to &s;tudy a &s;ubject, in order to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="13" REF="10">
and in order only to teach it. In morals and religion, the powers of per&s;ua&s;ion are cultivated by tho&s;e who&s;e em|ployment is public in&s;truction; but their wi&s;hes are fulfilled, and their care exhau&s;ted, in promoting the &s;ucce&s;s of their en|deavours upon others. The &s;ecret duty, of turning truly and in earne&s;t their attention upon them&s;elves, is &s;u&s;pended, not to &s;ay forgotten, amid&s;t the labours, the engagements, the po|pularity of their public mini&s;try; and, in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed minds, is interrupted, by the anxiety, or even by the &s;ati&s;|faction, with which their public &s;ervices are performed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are dangers adhering to the very nature of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion: but the evil is often al&s;o augmented by our im|prudence. In our wi&s;hes to convince, we are extremely apt to <HI>over&s;tate</HI> our arguments. We think no confidence, with which we &s;peak of them, can be too great, when our intention is to urge them upon our hearers. This zeal, not &s;eldom, I believe, defeats its own purpo&s;e, even with tho&s;e whom we addre&s;s; but it always de&s;troys the efficacy of the argument upon our&s;elves. We are con&s;cious of the exaggeration, whe|ther our hearers perceive it or not: and this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s corrupts to us the whole influence of the conclu&s;ion; robs it even of its ju&s;t value. Demon&s;tration admits of no degrees: but real life knows nothing of demon&s;tration. It conver&s;es only with moral evidence and moral rea&s;oning. In the&s;e, the
<PB N="14" REF="11">
&s;cale of probability is exten&s;ive; and every argument hath its place in it. It may not be quite the &s;ame thing to over&s;tate a true rea&s;on, and to advance a fal&s;e one: but &s;ince two que&s;tions pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the judgement, u&s;ually joined together by their nature and importance, viz. on which &s;ide probability lies, and how much it preponderates; to tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of fair rea&s;oning in either que&s;tion; in either to go beyond our own perception of the &s;ubject, is a &s;imilar, if not an equal fault. In both ca&s;es it is a want of candour, which approaches to a want of veracity. But that, in which its wor&s;t effect is &s;een; that, at lea&s;t, which it belongs to this di&s;|cour&s;e to notice, is in its &s;o undermining the &s;olidity of our proofs, that our own under&s;tandings refu&s;e to re&s;t upon them; in vitiating the integrity of our own judgements; in render|ing our minds, as well incapable of e&s;timating the proper &s;trength of moral and religious arguments, as unrea&s;onably &s;u&s;picious of their truth, and dull and in&s;en&s;ible to their im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If dangers to our character accompany the exerci&s;e of our public mini&s;try, they no le&s;s attend upon the nature of our profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudies. It has been &s;aid, that literary trifling upon the &s;criptures has a tendency, above all other employments, to harden the heart. If by this maxim it be de&s;igned, to reprove the exerci&s;e, to check the freedom, or to que&s;tion the utility,
<PB N="15" REF="12">
of critical re&s;earches when employed upon the &s;acred volume, it is not by me to be defended. If it mean &s;imply to guard us again&s;t an exi&s;ting danger, to &s;tate an u&s;ual and natural con|&s;equence, the maxim wants neither truth nor u&s;e. It is founded in this ob&s;ervation: when any one, by the command of learn|ing and talents, has been fortunate enough to clear up an ob|&s;curity, or to &s;ettle a doubt in the interpretation of &s;cripture; plea&s;ed (and ju&s;tly plea&s;ed) with the re&s;ult of his endeavours, his thoughts are wont to indulge this complacency, and there to &s;top: or when another, by a patient application of inferior faculties, has made, as he thinks, &s;ome progre&s;s in theological &s;tudies; or even has with much attention engaged in them; he is apt to re&s;t and &s;tay in what he deems a religious and meritorious &s;ervice. The critic and the commentator do not always proceed with the reflection, that, if the&s;e things be true, if this book do indeed convey to us the will of God, then is it no longer to be &s;tudied and critici&s;ed alone, but, what is a very different work, to be obeyed, and to be acted upon. At lea&s;t, this ulterior operation of the mind, enfeebled perhaps by former exertions of quite another nature, does not always retain &s;ufficient force and vigor to bend the ob&s;tinacy of the will. To de&s;cribe the evil, is to point out the remedy; which mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in holding &s;teadfa&s;tly within our view this momentous con&s;ideration, that, however laboriou&s;ly, or how|ever
<PB N="16" REF="13">
&s;ucce&s;sfully, we may have cultivated religious &s;tudies; howmuch&s;oever we may have added to our learning or our fame, we have hitherto done little for our &s;alvation: that a more arduous, to us perhaps a new, and, it may be, a painful work, which the public eye &s;ees not, which no public favour will reward, yet remains to be attempted; that of in&s;tituting an examination of our hearts and of our conduct, of altering the &s;ecret cour&s;e of our behaviour, of reducing, with whatever violence to our habits, lo&s;s of our plea&s;ures, or interruption of our pur&s;uits, its deviations to a conformity with tho&s;e rules of life, which are delivered in the volume that lies open before us; and which, if it be of importance enough to de&s;erve our &s;tudy, ought, for rea&s;ons infinitely &s;uperior, to command our obedience.</P>
<P>Another di&s;advantage, incidental to the character of which we are now expo&s;ing the dangers, is the moral debility that ari&s;es from the want of being trained in the virtues of active life. This complaint belongs not to the clergy as &s;uch, becau&s;e their pa&s;toral office affords as many calls, and as many oppor|tunities, for beneficent exertions, as are u&s;ually found in private &s;tations; but it belongs to that &s;ecluded contemplative life, which men of learning often make choice of, or into which they are thrown by the accident of their fortunes. A great part of mankind owe their principles to their practice; that
<PB N="17" REF="14">
is, to that wonderful acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength and energy, which good di&s;po&s;itions receive from good actions. It is difficult to &s;u&s;tain virtue by meditation alone: but let our conclu&s;ions only have influence enough, once to determine us upon a cour&s;e of virtue, and that influence will acquire &s;uch aug|mentation of force from every in&s;tance of virtuous endeavour, as, ere long, to produce in us con&s;tancy and re&s;olution, a formed and a fixed character. Of this great and progre&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their principles, men who are withdrawn from the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the intercour&s;e of civil life, find them&s;elves in &s;ome mea&s;ure deprived. Virtue in them is left, more than in others, to the dictates of rea&s;on; to a &s;en&s;e of duty le&s;s aided by the power of habit. I will not deny that this difference renders their virtue more pure, more actual, and nearer to its principle; but it renders it le&s;s ea&s;y to be attained or pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Having propo&s;ed the&s;e circum&s;tances, as difficulties of which I think it u&s;eful that our order &s;hould be appri&s;ed; and as growing out of the functions of the profe&s;&s;ion, its &s;tudies, or the &s;ituations in which it places us; I proceed, with the &s;ame view, to notice a turn and habit of thinking, which is of late become very general among&s;t the higher cla&s;&s;es of the commu|nity, among&s;t all who occupy &s;tations of authority, and, in common with the&s;e two de&s;criptions of men, among&s;t the
<PB N="18" REF="15">
clergy. That which I am about to animadvert upon, is, in its place, and to a certain degree, undoubtedly a fair and right con&s;ideration; but, in the extent to which it prevails, has a tendency to di&s;charge from the hearts of mankind all religious principle whatever. What I mean, is the performing of our religious offices for the &s;ake of <HI>&s;etting an example</HI> to others; and the allowing of this motive &s;o to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, as to &s;ub&s;titute it&s;elf into the place of the proper ground and rea&s;on of the duty. I mu&s;t be permitted to contend, that, whenever this is the ca&s;e, it becomes not only a cold and ex|traneous, but a fal&s;e and unrea&s;onable principle of action. A conduct propagated through the different ranks of &s;ociety merely by this motive, is a chain without a &s;upport, a fabric without a foundation. The parts indeed depend upon one another, but there is nothing to bear up the whole. There mu&s;t be &s;ome rea&s;on for every duty be&s;ide example, or there can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for it at all. It is a perver&s;ion therefore of the regular order of our ideas, to &s;uffer a con&s;ideration, which, whatever be its importance, is only &s;econdary and con|&s;equential to another, to &s;hut out that other from the thoughts. The effect of this in the offices of religion, is utterly to de&s;troy their religious quality; to rob them of that, which gives to them their life, their &s;pirituality, their nature. They who would &s;et an example to others of acts of wor&s;hip and devotion,
<PB N="19" REF="16">
in truth perform none them&s;elves. Idle or proud &s;pectators of the &s;cene, they vouch&s;afe their pre&s;ence in our a&s;&s;emblies, for the edification, it &s;eems, and benefit of others, but as if they had no &s;ins of their own to deplore, no mercies to ac|knowledge, no pardon to intreat.</P>
<P>Shall the con&s;ideration then of example be prohibited and di&s;carded from the thoughts? By no means: but let it attend upon, not &s;uper&s;ede, the proper motive of the action. Let us learn to know and feel the rea&s;on, the value, and the ob|ligation of the duty, as it concerns our&s;elves; and, in propor|tion as we are affected by the force of the&s;e con&s;iderations, we &s;hall de&s;ire, and de&s;iring endeavour, to extend their influence to others. This wi&s;h, flowing from an original &s;en&s;e of each duty, pre&s;erves to the duty its proper principle. "Let your light &s;o &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." <HI>The glory of your heavenly Father,</HI> is &s;till, you ob&s;erve, the termi|nation of the precept. The love of God; that zeal for his ho|nour and &s;ervice, which love, which gratitude, which piety in&s;pires, are &s;till to be the operating motive of your conduct. Becau&s;e we find it convenient to our&s;elves, that tho&s;e about us &s;hould be religious; or becau&s;e it is u&s;eful to the &s;tate, that re|ligion &s;hould be upheld in the country; to join, from the&s;e motives, in the public ordinances of the church, for the
<PB N="20" REF="17">
&s;ake of maintaining their credit by our pre&s;ence and example, however advi&s;eable it may be as a branch of &s;ecular prudence, is not either to fulfill our Lord's precept, or to perform any religious &s;ervice. Religion can only &s;pring from its own principle. Believing our &s;alvation to be involved in the faith|ful di&s;charge of our religious as well as moral duties, or rather that they are the &s;ame; experiencing the warmth, the con&s;ola|tion, the virtuous energy, which every act of true devotion communicates to the heart, and how much the&s;e effects are heightened by con&s;ent and &s;ympathy; with the benevolence with which we love our neighbour, loving al&s;o and &s;eeking his immortal welfare: when, prompted by the&s;e &s;entiments, we unite with him in acts of &s;ocial homage to our Maker, then hath every principle its weight; then, at length, is our wor&s;hip what it ought to be; exemplary yet our own; not the le&s;s per&s;onal for being public. We bring our hearts to the &s;ervice, and not a con&s;trained attendance upon the place, with often|times an ill-concealed indifference to what is there pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>If what we have &s;tated concerning example be true; if the con&s;ideration of it be liable to be over&s;tretched or mi&s;applied, no per&s;ons can be more in danger of falling into the mi&s;take, than they who are taught to regard them&s;elves, as placed in their &s;tations for the purpo&s;e of becoming the examples as well as in&s;tructors of their flocks. It is nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould
<PB N="21" REF="18">
be admoni&s;hed to revert continually to the fundamental cau&s;e of all obligation and of all duty; particularly to remember, that in their religious offices, they have not only to pronounce, to excite, to conduct the devotion of their congregations, but to pay to God the adoration which them&s;elves owe to him; in a word, amid&s;t their care of others, to &s;ave their own &s;ouls by their own religion.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I think, are &s;ome of the cau&s;es, which, in the con|duct of their lives, call for a peculiar attention from the clergy and from men of learning; and which render the apo&s;tle's ex|ample, and the le&s;&s;on which it teaches, peculiarly applicable to their circum&s;tances. It remains only to remind them of a con&s;ideration, which ought to counteract the&s;e di&s;advantages, by producing a care and &s;olicitude, &s;ufficient to meet every danger, and every difficulty: to remind them, I &s;ay, for they cannot need to be informed, of our Lord's &s;olemn declaration, that contumacious knowledge, and neglected talents, know|ledge which doth not lead to obedience, and talents which re&s;t in u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculations, will be found, in the day of final account, among&s;t the objects of his &s;evere&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure. Would to God, that men of learning always under&s;tood, how deeply they are concerned in this warning! It is impo&s;&s;ible to add another rea&s;on, which can be equal or &s;econd to our Lord's admonition: but we may &s;ugge&s;t a motive, of very di&s;tant
<PB N="22" REF="19">
indeed, but of no mean importance, and to which they cer|tainly will not refu&s;e its due regard, the honour and e&s;timation of learning it&s;elf. Irregular morals in men of di&s;tingui&s;hed attainments, render them, not de&s;pi&s;ed (for talents and learning never can be de&s;picable), but &s;ubjects of malicious remark, per|haps of affected pity, to the enemies of intellectual liberty, of &s;cience and literature; and, at the &s;ame time, of &s;incere, though &s;ilent regret to tho&s;e, who are de&s;irous of &s;upporting the e&s;teem, which ought to await the &s;ucce&s;sful pur&s;uit of ingenuous &s;tudies. We intreat &s;uch men to reflect, that their conduct will be made the reply of idlene&s;s to indu&s;try, the revenge of dulne&s;s and ignorance upon parts and learning; to con&s;ider, how many will &s;eek, and think they find, in their example, an apology for &s;loth, and for indifference to all liberal improvement; what a theme, la&s;tly, they &s;upply to tho&s;e, who, to the di&s;courage|ment of every mental exertion, preach up the vanity of human knowledge, and the danger or the mi&s;chief of &s;uperior attain|ments.</P>
<P>But if the reputation of learning be concerned in the con|duct of tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to its pur&s;uit, the &s;acred intere&s;ts of morality are not le&s;s &s;o. It is for us to take care, that we ju&s;tify not the boa&s;ts, or the &s;neers, of infidelity; that we do not authorize the wor&s;t of all &s;ceptici&s;m, that which would &s;ubvert the di&s;tinctions of moral good and evil, by in|&s;inuating

concerning them, that their only &s;upport is preju|dice, their only origin in the artifice of the wi&s;e, and the credulity of the multitude; and that the&s;e things are but too clearly confe&s;&s;ed by the lives of men of learning and enquiry. This calumny let us contradict; let us refute. Let us &s;hew, that virtue and chri&s;tianity ca&s;t their deepe&s;t foundations in knowledge; that, however they may a&s;k the aid of principles, which, in a great degree, govern human life (and which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, therefore, be either powerful allies, or irre&s;i&s;tible adver&s;aries), of education, of habit, of example, of public au|thority, of public in&s;titutions, they re&s;t, neverthele&s;s, upon the firm ba&s;is of rational argument. Let us te&s;tify to the world our &s;en&s;e of this great truth, by the only evidence which the world will believe, the influence of our conclu&s;ions upon our own conduct.</P>
