<P>_SINCE I am allow'd the honour, and
Privilege of &s;o ea&s;y Acce&s;s to Your
Royal Highne&s;s, I dare &s;ay, I &s;hall not
be the wor&s;e receiv'd for bringing <HI>Ovid</HI>
along with me. He comes from Ba|ni&s;hment
to the Fautre&s;s of Liberty;
from the Barbarous to the Polite; and has this to recom|mend
him, which never fails with a Clemency, like Your's;
He is Unfortunate.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
Your Royal Highne&s;s, who feels for every one, has
lately been the mournful Occa&s;ion of a like Sen&s;ibility
in many Others. Scarce an Eye, that did not tell the
Danger You were in: Even Parties, tho'different in Prin|ciples,
united at that time in their grief, and affectionate
concern, for an event of &s;o much con&s;equence to the In|tere&s;t
of Humanity, and Virtue; whil&s;t Your Self was
the only Per&s;on, Then, unmov'd.</P>
<P>It was remarkable, That She, who, with a Manner
mo&s;t engaging, taught the innocent Plea&s;ures to appear
more de&s;irable, than the criminal; who was every day
the Life of &s;ome new agreeable Diver&s;ion; &s;hould be|have
Her Self, upon that cruel Tryal, with a Magnanimi|ty
&s;o un&s;haken, that tho&s;e who were Witne&s;&s;es might
have imagin'd, She &s;carce ever had done any thing, but
&s;tudy how to Dye.</P>
<P>It is the greate&s;t Happine&s;s can attend an Age un|der
a long depravation of Morals, to be ble&s;t with Ex|amples,
where Virtue is &s;et off by the advantage of Birth.
Such Qualifications, when united, do not only per&s;uade
an Imitation, but Command it. Humane Nature is al|ways
more affected by what it &s;ees, than what it hears of:
And as tho&s;e Ideas, which enter by the Eye, find the &s;u|re&s;t
pa&s;&s;age to the Heart; &s;o the more the Object, what|ever
it be, &s;eems de&s;irable to the One, the longer it con|tinues
in the Other.</P>
<P>There are Perfections &s;o &s;hining, that one mu&s;t be the
very Wor&s;t of Mortals, or the very Be&s;t, not to admire
in all Tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them. To be ble&s;t with a di&s;po|&s;ition
to Charity, not confin'd by any other Limits, than
the Mode&s;ty of tho&s;e who ask It: To know, and be rea|dy
<PB REF="6">
to excu&s;e Faults; yet, &s;o &s;trict in Life, as not to want
the like Indulgence; To have a Superiority of Genius
capable of judging of the highe&s;t Affairs, and an Appli|cation
&s;o ob&s;ervant, as to penetrate into the mo&s;t Minute:
To be ea&s;y to lay down Grandeur upon familiar Occa&s;i|ons,
and di&s;cerning to take It up, when Dignity of Sta|tion
requires; To know the politer Languages of the
pre&s;ent Age, as a Native, and the greater Occurrences,
and Periods of the Pa&s;t, as an Hi&s;torian, make up a Cha|racter,
which is &s;o obvious, that Every one will know
where to apply it, except the Per&s;on, who&s;e it really is:
and if in this Your Royal Highne&s;s be at a Lo&s;s, I think
it is the only thing within the Province of Your Sex
You are ignorant of.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take up no more of Your time in this Dedicati|on;

to You, &s;hall always be the Endeavour of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Method I propo&s;e in writing this Preface, is to take
Notice of &s;ome of the Beauties of the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> and
al&s;o of the Faults, and particular Affectations. After which
I &s;hall proceed to hint at &s;ome Rules for Tran&s;lation in ge|neral;
and &s;hall give a &s;hort Account of the following
Ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to impo&s;e my Opinion on others with the magi&s;terial
Authority of a Critic; but only take the Liberty of di&s;covering my own
Ta&s;te. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how our Poet's Redundance of Wit, Ju&s;tne&s;s
of Compari&s;ons, Elegance of De&s;criptions, and peculiar Delicacy in touch|ing
every Circum&s;tance relating to the Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affections; and with
the &s;ame Impartiality, and Frankne&s;s, I &s;hall confe&s;s the too frequent Pueri|lities
of his luxuriant Fancy, and the too great Negligence of his &s;ome|times
unlabour'd Ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>I am not of an Opinion, too common to Tran&s;lators, to think that One
is under an Obligation to extoll every thing he finds in the Author he un|dertakes:
I am &s;ure one is no more oblig'd to do &s;o, than a Painter is to
make every Face that &s;its to him hand&s;ome. 'Tis enough if he &s;ets the
be&s;t Features he finds in their full, and mo&s;t advantageous Light. But if the
Poet has private Deformities, tho' Good-breeding will not allow to expo&s;e
him naked, yet &s;urely there can be no Rea&s;on to recommend him, as the
mo&s;t fini&s;h'd Model of Harmony, and Proportion.</P>
<P>Whoever has this undi&s;tingui&s;hing Complai&s;ance, will not fail to vitiate
the Ta&s;te of the Readers, and mi&s;guide many of them in their Judgment,
where to Approve, and where to Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, that where there appears an infinite Variety of ini|mitable
Excellencies, it would be too har&s;h, and di&s;ingenuous to be &s;evere on
&s;uch Faults, as have e&s;cap'd rather thro' want of Lei&s;ure, and Opportunity to
correct, than thro' the erroneous Turn of a deprav'd Judgment. How
&s;en&s;ible <HI>Ovid</HI> him&s;elf was of the Uncorrectne&s;s of the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> ap|pears
from the&s;e Lines prefix'd before &s;ome of the Editions by the Care of
his Commentators;<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tri&s;t. El. vi</NOTE><L>Orba parente &s;uo quicunque Volumina tangis,</L>

<L>Qu&ograve;&abque; magis &s;aveas; non &s;unt haec edita ab Illo,</L>
<L>Sed qua&s;i de domini funere rapta &s;ui.</L>

<L>Emendaturus, &s;i licui&s;&s;e&s;, erat.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="8">
Since therefore the Readers are not &s;olemnly invited to an Entertainment,
but come accidentally; they ought to be contented with what they find:
And pray what have they to complain of, but too great Variety? where,
tho' &s;ome of the Di&s;hes be not &s;erv'd in the exacte&s;t Order, and Politene&s;s,
but ha&s;h'd up in ha&s;te; there are a great many accommodated to every par|ticular
Palate.</P>
<P>To like every thing, &s;hows too little Delicacy; and to like nothing, too
much Difficulty. So great is the Variety of this Poem, that the Reader,
who is never pleas'd, will appear as mon&s;trous, as he that is always &s;o. Here
are the Hurries of Battles for the Heroe, tender Emotions of Soul for the
Lover, a Search, and Penetration into Nature for the Philo&s;opher, Fluency
of Numbers, and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive Figures for the Poet, Morals for the Seri|ous,
and Plai&s;antries for Admirers of Points of Wit.</P>
<P>'Tis certain a Poet is more to be &s;u&s;pected for &s;aying too much, than too
little. To add is often hazardous; but to retrench, commonly judicious.
If our Author, in&s;tead of &s;aying all he could, had only &s;aid all he &s;hould;
<HI>Daphne</HI> had done well to fly from the God of Wit, in order to crown his
Poet: Thus <HI>Ovid</HI> had been more honour'd, and ador'd in his Exile, than
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in his Triumphs.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now attempt to give &s;ome In&s;tances of the Happine&s;s, and va&s;t Ex|tent
of our Author's Imagination. I &s;hall not proceed according to the
Order of the Poem, but rather tran&s;cribe &s;ome Lines here, and there, as
my Reflection &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<Q><L>Nec circum&s;u&s;o pendebat in aere tellus</L>
<L>Ponderibus librata &s;uis&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Thus was the State of Nature before the Creation: And here it is obvi|ous,
that <HI>Ovid</HI> had a di&s;cerning Notion of the Gravitation of Bodies. 'Tis now
demon&s;trated, that every Part of Matter tends to every Part of Matter with
a Force, which is always in a direct &s;imple Proportion of the Quantity of
the Matter, and an inver&s;e duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tance; which Ten|dency,
or Gravitating is con&s;tant, and univer&s;al. This Power, whatever it be,
acting always proportionably to the &s;olid Content of Bodies, and never in any
Proportion to their Superficies; cannot be explain'd by any material Impul&s;e.
For the Laws of Impul&s;e are phy&s;ically nece&s;&s;ary: There can be no
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or arbitrary Principle in meer Matter; its Parts cannot move unle&s;s
they be mov'd; and cannot do otherwi&s;e, when pre&s;s'd on by other Parts in
Motion; and therefore 'tis evident from the following Lines, that <HI>Ovid</HI>
&s;trictly adher'd to the Opinion of the mo&s;t di&s;cerning Philo&s;ophers, who
taught that all things were form'd by a wi&s;e, and intelligent Mind.</P>
<Q><L>Ju&s;&s;it &amp; extendi campos, &s;ub&s;idere valles,</L>
<L>Fronde tegi &s;ylvas&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Fiat</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Law-giver is not more &s;ublime, than the <HI>Ju&s;&s;it</HI>
of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet, who goes on in the &s;ame Elevated, and Philo&s;ophical
Style.</P>
<Q><PB N="iii" REF="9">
<L>His &s;uper impo&s;uit liquidum, &amp; gravitate carentem</L>
<L>Aethera&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Here the Author &s;preads a thin Veil of <HI>Aether</HI> over his Infant Creation;
and tho' his a&s;&s;erting the upper Region to be void of Gravitation, may not,
in a Mathematical Rigour, be true; yet 'tis found from the Natural Enquities
made &s;ince, and e&s;pecially from the learned Dr. <HI>Hally</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e on the
<HI>Barometer,</HI> that if, on the Surface of the Earth, an Inch of Quick&s;ilver in
the Tube be equal to a Cylinder of Air of 300 Foot, it will be at a Mile's
height equal to a Cylinder of Air of 2700000: and therefore the Air at &s;o
great a Di&s;tance from the Earth, mu&s;t be rarify'd to &s;o great a Degree, that
the Space it fills mu&s;t bear a very &s;mall Proportion to that which is entirely
void of Matter.</P>
<P>I think, we may be confident from what already appears, as well as from
what our Author has writ on the <HI>Roman</HI> Fea&s;ts, that he cou'd not be total|ly
ignorant of A&s;tronomy. Some of the Criticks wou'd in&s;inuate from the
following Lines, that he mi&s;took the annual Motion of the Sun for the
Diurnal.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Met. B. 2.</NOTE><L>Sectus in obliquum&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Tho' the Sun be always in one or other of the Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and
never goes by either Motion more Northward, or Southward, than is here
de&s;crib'd; Yet <HI>Phaeton</HI> being de&s;ign'd to drive the Chariot but one Day,
ought to have been directed in the <HI>Aequator,</HI> or a Circle Parallel to it, and
not round the other Oblique one of the Ecliptick: a Degree of which, and
that by a Motion contrary to the Diurnal, he was obliged to go in that
length of Time.</P>
<P>I am inclin'd to think, that <HI>Ovid</HI> had &s;o great an Attention to Poetical
Embeli&s;hments, that he voluntarily declin'd a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of any A&s;tro|nomical
Sy&s;tem. For tho' that Science was far from being neglected in
former Ages; yet the Progre&s;s which was made in it, by no means equall'd
that of our pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P><HI>Lucretius,</HI> tho' in other things mo&s;t penetrating, de&s;cribes the Sun &s;carce
bigger, than he appears to the Eye.</P>
<Q><L>Nec nimio &s;olis major rota, nec minor ardor</L>
<L>E&s;&s;e pote&s;t, no&s;tris quam &s;en&s;ibus e&s;&s;e videtur.</L></Q>
<P>And <HI>Homer,</HI> imagining the Seats of the Gods above the fix'd Stars, re|pre&s;ents
the falling of <HI>Vulcan</HI> from thence to the I&s;le of <HI>Lemnos,</HI> to conti|nue
during a whole Day.</P>
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> B. 1.</NOTE><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines">&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Poet aims here to give a &s;urpri&s;ing Idea of the height of the
Cele&s;tial Man&s;ions: but if the Computation of a modern A&s;tronomer be
<PB N="iv" REF="10">
true, they are at &s;o much a greater Di&s;tance, that <HI>Vulcan</HI> wou'd have been
more Years in falling, than he was Minutes.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t I &s;hou'd exceed the u&s;ual Length of a Preface, I &s;hall now give
&s;ome In&s;tances of the Propriety of our Author's Similes, and Epithets; the
Per&s;picuity of his Allegories; the In&s;tructive Excellence of the Morals; the
peculiar happy Turn of his Fancy; and &s;hall begin with the Elegance of his
De&s;criptions.</P>

<P>There are many other De&s;criptions &s;catter'd in the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> which,
for ju&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion of Nature, and Maje&s;tick Modulation of Words, are on|ly
Inferior to tho&s;e already tran&s;crib'd, as they are &s;horter; which makes
the Objection, that his Diction is commonly loytring into Pro&s;e, a great
deal too &s;evere.</P>
<P>The <HI>Metamorpho&s;es</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd, as is ob&s;erv'd before, very un|correct;
and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Works as fini&s;h'd: tho' his own Mode&s;ty wou'd not
allow the <HI>Aeneids</HI> to be &s;o. It &s;eems it was harder for him to plea&s;e him&s;elf,
than his Readers. His Judgment was certainly great, nor was his Vivacity
of Imagination le&s;s; for the fir&s;t without the la&s;t is too heavy, and like a
Dre&s;s without Fancy; and the la&s;t without the fir&s;t is too gay, and but all
Trimming.</P>
<P>Our Author's Similitudes are next to be con&s;ider'd, which are always re|markably
&s;hort, and convey &s;ome plea&s;ing Idea to the Imagination. 'Tis
in this Branch of the Poem, that he has di&s;cover'd as ju&s;t a Judgement, as a|ny
of the Cla&s;&s;icks whatever. Poets, to give a Loo&s;e to a warm Fancy, are
generally too apt, not only to expatiate in their Simile's, but introduce them
too frequently; by doing the fir&s;t, they detain the Attention too long from
the principal Narration; and by the latter, they make too frequent Breaches
in the Unity of the Poem.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e two Errors <HI>Ovid</HI> has mo&s;t di&s;cerningly avoided. How &s;hort, and
&s;ignificant are generally his Compari&s;ons! he fails not, in the&s;e, to keep a
&s;tiff Rein on a High-mettled <HI>Pega&s;us</HI>; and takes care not to &s;urfeit here, as
he has done on other Heads, by an erroneous Abundance.</P>

all a Simplicity, and a Confinement to the pre&s;ent Object; always a Fecun|dity
of Fancy, but rarely an Intemperance: nor do I remember he has err'd
above once by an ill-judg'd Superfluity. After he has de&s;crib'd the Labyrinth

he fails of an applicable Relation betwixt the principal Subject, and

well as tho&s;e of <HI>Medea,</HI> and <HI>Scylla.</HI> The two la&s;t are left by their Heroes,
and their Reflections are very Natural, and Affecting. <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;eem'd here to
have had <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dido</HI> in his Eye, but with this difference; the
one had convers'd much with Ladies, and knew they lov'd to talk a great
deal: The other con&s;ider'd no le&s;s what was natural for them to &s;ay, than
what became them to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has, through the whole Management of this Rencounter, di&s;cover'd
a mo&s;t fini&s;h'd Judgment. <HI>Aeneas,</HI> like other Men, likes for Convenience,
and leaves for greater. <HI>Dido,</HI> like other Ladies, re&s;ents the Neglect, enu|merates
the Obligations the Lover is under, upbraids him with Ingratitude,
threatens him with Revenge, then by and by &s;ubmits, begs for Compa&s;&s;i|on,
and has recour&s;e to Tears.</P>
<P>It appears from this Piece, that <HI>Virgil</HI> was a di&s;cerning Ma&s;ter in the
Pa&s;&s;ion of Love: And they that con&s;ider the Spirit, and Turn of that inimi|table
Line&mdash;<HI>Qui Bavium non odit</HI>&mdash;cannot doubt but he had an e|qual
Talent for Satyr.</P>
<P>Nor does the Genius of <HI>Ovid</HI> more exert on the Subject of Love,
than on all others. In the Contention of <HI>Ajax, Uly&s;&s;es</HI> his Elocuti|on
is mo&s;t nervous, and per&s;wading. Where he endeavours to di&s;&s;wade Man|kind

<P>Certainly no body can imagine but the&s;e two celebrated Authors under|&s;tood
their own Tongue better, than the &s;crupulous Grammarians of After|ages,
who are too Dogmatical, and Self-&s;ufficient, when they pre&s;ume to
cen&s;ure Either of them for not attending &s;trictly enough to Syntax, and the
Mea&s;ure of Ver&s;e. The <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue is a dead Language, and none can
decide with Confidence on the Harmony, or Di&s;onance of the Numbers of
the&s;e Times, unle&s;s they were thoroughly acquainted with their Pau&s;es, and
Cadence. They may indeed pronounce with much more A&s;&s;urance on
their Diction; and di&s;tingui&s;h where they have been negligent, and where
more fini&s;h'd. There are certainly many Lines in <HI>Ovid,</HI> where he has been
downright Lazy, and where he might have avoided the Appearance of

<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h my Remarks on our Author, by taking Notice of the Ju&s;t|ne&s;s,
and Per&s;picuity of his Allegories; which are either Phy&s;ical or Natural;
Moral; or Hi&s;torical. Of the fir&s;t Kind is the Fable of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Python</HI>;
in the Explanation of this all the <HI>Mythologi&s;ts</HI> agree; Exhalations and Mi&s;ts
being the con&s;tant Effects of Inundations, are here di&s;&s;ipated by the Rays
of the Sun.</P>
<P>Of the Second Kind, are <HI>Acteon</HI> torn to Pieces by his own Pack of Dogs,
and <HI>Eri&s;icthon</HI> &s;tarv'd by the Di&s;ea&s;e of Hunger. The&s;e two Allegories
&s;eem to &s;ignify, that Extravagance and Luxury end in Want.</P>
<P>Of the Third, is the Story of the Rape of <HI>Europa.</HI> Hi&s;tory &s;ays, &s;he
was Daughter to <HI>Agenor,</HI> and carry'd by the <HI>Candians</HI> in a Gally, bearing
a Bull in the Stern, in order to be marry'd to one of their Kings nam'd
<HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>This Explanation gives an Occa&s;ion for a Digre&s;&s;ion which is not alto|gether
foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, becau&s;e it will be of U&s;e to ju&s;tify
<HI>Ovid</HI> on &s;ome other Occa&s;ions, where he is cen&s;ur'd for being too free with
the Characters of the Gods. I was once repre&s;enting the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> as
an excellent Sy&s;tem of Morality; but an illu&s;trious Lady, who&s;e lea&s;t
Advantage above her Sex, is that of being one of the greate&s;t Prince&s;&s;es in
<HI>Europe,</HI> objected, that the loo&s;e and immode&s;t Sallys of <HI>Jupiter</HI> did by
no means confirm my A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>One mu&s;t con&s;ider, that what appear'd an Ab&s;urdity in <HI>Ovid,</HI> is not &s;o
much his own Fault, as that of the Times before him. The Characters of
the Gods of the old Heroick Age repre&s;ented them unju&s;t in their Actions;
mutable in their De&s;igns; partial in their Favours; ignorant of Events; &s;cur|rilous
in their Language. Some of the &s;uperior Hierarchy treating one a|nother

<P>The Commentators may endeavour to hide tho&s;e Ab&s;urdities under the
Veil of Allegories; but the Reader that con&s;iders the whole Texture of
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> will find, that the Author's Meaning, and their Interpretation are
often as unlike, as the imaginary Heroes of his time, are to the real ones
of Ours.</P>
<P>Allegories &s;hould be obvious, and not like Meteors in the Air, which re|pre&s;ent
a different Figure to every different Eye. Now they are Armies of
Soldiers; now Flocks of Sheep; and by and by, nothing.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Criticks of a more exalted Ta&s;te, may di&s;cover &s;uch Beau|ties
in the antient Poetry, as may e&s;cape the Comprehen&s;ion of us Pigmies
of a more limited Genius. They may be able to fathom the Divine Sen&s;e of
the Pagan Theology; whi&s;t we aim at no more, than to judge of a little
common Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, and ever will be a Rule to a great many, to applaud and condemn
with the general Vogue, tho' never &s;o ill grounded. The mo&s;t are affraid
of being Particular; and rather than &s;trive again&s;t the Stream, are proud
of being in the wrong with the Many, rather than de&s;irous of being in the
right with the Few: and tho' they be convinc'd of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of
di&s;&s;enting from the common Cry, yet out of a poor fear of Cen&s;ure, they
contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and thus become an Authority again&s;t others,
who in reality are but of their own Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> was &s;o far from paying a blind deference to the venerable Name
of his <HI>Grecian</HI> Predece&s;&s;or, in the Character of his Gods; that when <HI>Ju|piter</HI>
puni&s;hes <HI>Andromeda</HI> for the Crimes of her Mother, he calls him <HI>in|ju&s;tus
Ammon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Met. B. 4.</NOTE> and takes commonly an honourable care of the Decorum of the
Godhead, when their Actions are con&s;i&s;tent with the Divinity of their Cha|racter.
His Allegories include &s;ome Religious, or in&s;tructive Moral, wrap'd up
in a peculiar Per&s;picuity. The Fable of <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> being &s;ometimes in Hell,
and &s;ometimes with <HI>Ceres</HI> her Mother, can &s;carce mean any thing el&s;e than the
&s;owing and coming up of Corn. The various Dre&s;&s;es, that <HI>Vertumnus,</HI> the
God of Sea&s;ons, puts on in his Court&s;hip of <HI>Pomona</HI> the Garden Godde&s;s,
&s;eem plainly to expre&s;s the different and mo&s;t proper times for Digging,
Planting, Pruning, and gathering the Increa&s;e. I &s;hall be &s;horter on this
Head, becau&s;e our Countryman Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> has, by a laborious Search a|mong&s;t
the Mythologi&s;ts, been very full. He has annex'd his Explanations to
the end of each Book, which de&s;erve to be recommended to tho&s;e, that are
Curious in this figurative Learning.</P>
<P>The Reader cannot fail of ob&s;erving, how many excellent Le&s;&s;ons of Mo|rality
<HI>Ovid</HI> has given us in the cour&s;e of his Fables.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> and <HI>Pyrrba</HI> teaches, that Piety and Innocence
cannot mi&s;s of the divine Protection, and that the only Lo&s;s irreparable is

De&s;ires; affectionate in their conjugal Relation; &s;o religious in Life, that
when they ob&s;erv'd their homely Cabbin ri&s;ing to a Temple, all the Boun|ty
they ask'd of the Gods they had entertain'd, was, that they might do
the Office of Prie&s;thood there; and at their Death, not &s;urvive one another.</P>
<P>The Stories of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> and <HI>Pentheus,</HI> not only deter from Infidelity, and
Irreverence to the Gods; but the la&s;t al&s;o &s;hows, that too great Zeal produ|ces
the &s;ame Effects, as none at all; and that Enthu&s;ia&s;m is often more cruel,
than Athei&s;m.</P>
<P>The Story of <HI>Minos,</HI> and <HI>Scylla</HI> repre&s;ents the Infamy of &s;elling our Coun|try;
and teaches, that even they who love the Crime, abhor the Criminal.</P>
<P>In <HI>Cippus</HI> we find a noble Magnanimity, and Heavenly Self-denial: he
prefer'd the Good of the Republick to his own private Grandeur; and cho&s;e
with an exemplary Genero&s;ity, rather to live a private Free-Man out of
<HI>Rome,</HI> than to command Numbers of Slaves in it.</P>
<P>From the Story of <HI>Hercules</HI> we learn, that Glory is a Lady, who, like ma|ny
others, loves to have her Admirers &s;uffer a great deal for her. The
Poet enumerates the Labours of the Heroe; &s;hows how he conquer'd eve|ry
thing for Others, but nothing for him&s;elf: Then does him the Poe|tical
Ju&s;tice of an Apotheo&s;is; thinking it mo&s;t fit that one, who had born
the Cele&s;tial Orbs on his Shoulders, &s;hou'd have a Man&s;ion among&s;t them.</P>
<P>From the A&s;&s;umption of <HI>Romulus</HI>; that when War is at an end, the chief
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Peace &s;hould be the enacting good Laws; that after a People
are pre&s;erv'd from the Enemy; the next care &s;hou'd be, to pre&s;erve them
from them&s;elves; and therefore the be&s;t Legi&s;lators de&s;erve a Place among&s;t
Heroes, and Deities.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ariadne</HI> being inhumanly de&s;erted by <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> and generou&s;ly re|ceiv'd
by <HI>Bacchus</HI> we find, that as there is nothing we can be &s;ure of, &s;o
there is nothing we ought to de&s;pair of.</P>
<P>From <HI>Althea</HI> burning the Brand; that we &s;hou'd take care lea&s;t under the
Notion of Ju&s;tice, we &s;hou'd do a Cruelty; for they that are &s;et upon Re|venge,
only endeavour to imitate the Injury.</P>
<P>From <HI>Polyphemus</HI> making Love to <HI>Galatea</HI> one may ob&s;erve, that the
mo&s;t deform'd can find &s;omething to like in thier own Per&s;on. He examines
his Face in the Stream, combs his ruful Locks with a Rake, grows more
exact, and &s;tudious of his Dre&s;s, and di&s;covers the fir&s;t Sign of being in
Love, by endeavouring at a more, than u&s;ual Care to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fable of <HI>Cephalus,</HI> and <HI>Procrys</HI> confirms, that every Trifle contri|butes
to heighten the Di&s;ea&s;e of Jealou&s;y; and that the mo&s;t convincing

<P>From that of <HI>Hippomenes,</HI> and <HI>Atalanta</HI> we may di&s;cover, that a gene|rous

<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hor. B. 3. Od. 30.</NOTE><L>Exegi monumentum aere perennius,</L>
<L>Regalique &s;itu Pyramidum altius,</L>
<L>Quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens</L>
<L>Po&s;&s;it diruere, aut innumerabilis</L>
<L>Annorum &s;eries, &amp; fuga temporum.</L>
<L>Non omnis moriar.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The whole Ode is in a manner a continu'd Compliment to his own Wri|tings;
nor, in Imitation of this celebrated Author, want we Poets of our
pre&s;ent Age, who have been pleas'd to rank them&s;elves among&s;t their own
Admirers.</P>
<P>I have done with the Original, and &s;hall make no Excu&s;e for the length
of the Preface, becau&s;e it is in the power of the Reader to make is as &s;hort
as he plea&s;es. I &s;hall now conclude with a Word or two about the Ver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tran&s;lation is commonly either Verbal, or Paraphra&s;e, or Imitation; of
the fir&s;t &s;ort is Mr. <HI>Sands</HI>'s, which I think the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es</HI> can by no
means allow of. It is agreed, the Author left it unfini&s;h'd; if it had under|gone
his la&s;t Hand, it is more than probable, that many Superfluities had
been retrench'd. Where a Poem is perfectly fini&s;h'd; the Tran&s;lation, with
regard to particular Idioms, cannot be too exact; by doing this, the Sen&s;e
of the Author is more entirely his own, and the Ca&s;t of the Periods more faith|fully
pre&s;erv'd: But where a Poem is tedious through Exuberance, or dark
through a ha&s;ty Brevity, I think the Tran&s;lator may be excus'd for doing
what the Author upon revi&s;ing, wou'd have done him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> had been of this Opinion, perhaps other Tran&s;lations of
the <HI>Metamorpho&s;es</HI> had not been attempted.</P>
<P>A Critick has ob&s;erv'd, that in his Ver&s;ion of this Book, he has &s;crupu|lou&s;ly
confin'd the Number of his Lines to tho&s;e of the Original. 'Tis fit
I &s;hould take the Summ upon Content, and be better bred, than to count
after him.</P>
<P>The Manner that &s;eems mo&s;t &s;uited for this pre&s;ent Undertaking, is nei|ther
to follow the Author too clo&s;e out of a Critical Timorou&s;ne&s;s; nor aban|don
him too wantonly through a Poetick Boldne&s;s. The Original &s;hould always
be kept in View, without too apparent a Deviation from the Sen&s;e. Where
it is otherwi&s;e; it is not a Ver&s;ion, but an Imitation. The Tran&s;lator ought
to be as intent to keep up the Gracefulne&s;s of the Poem, as artful to hide
its Imperfections; to copy its Beauties, and to throw a Shade over its Blemi|&s;hes;
to be faithful to an Idolatry, where the Author excells; and to take
the Licence of a little Paraphra&s;e; where Penury of Fancy, or Dryne&s;s of
Expre&s;&s;ion &s;eem to ask for it.</P>
<P>The Ingenious Gentlemen concern'd in this Undertaking &s;eem to be of
this Opinion; and therefore they have not only con&s;ulted the Reputation
of the Author, but their own al&s;o. There is one of them has no other
Share in this Compliment, than by being the Occa&s;ion of engaging them
that have, in obliging the Publick. He has al&s;o &s;o ju&s;t to the Memo|ry,
<PB N="xx" REF="26">
and Reputation of Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> as to give his incomparable Lines the
Advantage of appearing &s;o near his Own.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s by that Admirable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet, without endeavouring to
make his Country &s;en&s;ible of the Obligations they have to his Mu&s;e. Whe|ther
they con&s;ider the flowing Grace of his Ver&s;ification; the vigorous Sal|lies
of his Fancy; or the peculiar Delicacy of his Periods; they'll di&s;cover
Excellencies never to be enough admir'd. If they trace him from the fir&s;t
Productions of his Youth, to the la&s;t Performances of his Age, they'll find,
that as the Tyranny of Rhyme never impos'd on the Per&s;picuity of the
Sen&s;e; &s;o a languid Sen&s;e never wanted to be &s;et off by the Harmony of
Rhyme. And as his earlier Works wanted no Maturity; &s;o his latter want|ed
no Force, or Spirit. The falling off of his Hair, had no other Con|&s;equence,
than to make his Lawrels be &s;een the more.</P>
<P>As a Tran&s;lator he was ju&s;t; as an Inventer he was rich. His Ver&s;ions of
&s;ome parts of <HI>Lucretius, Horace, Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> throughout, gave him
a ju&s;t pretence to that Compliment which was made to <HI>Mon&s;ieur d'Ablan|court,</HI>
a celebrated <HI>French</HI> Tran&s;later; <HI>It is uncertain who have the great|e&s;t
Obligations to Him, the Dead or the Living.</HI></P>
<P>With all the&s;e wondrous Talents, He was Libell'd in his Life-time by the
very Men, who had no other Excellencies, but as they were his Imitators.
Where he was allow'd to have Sentiments &s;uperior to all others, they charg|ed
him with Theft: But how did he Steal? no otherwi&s;e, than like tho&s;e, that
&s;teal Beggars Children, only to cloath them the better.</P>
<P>'Tis to be lamented, that Gentlemen &s;till continue this unfair Behaviour,
and treat one another every Day with mo&s;t injurious Libels. The Mu&s;es
&s;hould be Ladies of a cha&s;te and fair Behaviour: when they are otherwi&s;e,
they are Furies. 'Tis certain that <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> is at be&s;t but a barren Moun|tain,
and its Inhabitants contrive to make it more &s;o by their un-neighbour|ly
Deportment; the Authors are the only Corporation that endeavour at
the Ruin of their own Society. Every Day may convince them, how much a
rich Fool is re&s;pected above a poor Wit. The only Talents in E&s;teem at
pre&s;ent are tho&s;e of <HI>Exchange-Ally</HI>; one Tally is worth a Grove of Bays;
and 'tis of much more Con&s;equence to be well read in the Tables of Inte|re&s;t,
and the Ri&s;e and Fall of Stocks, than in the Revolution of Empires.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is &s;till a &s;ad, and &s;hameful In&s;tance of this Truth: The Man, that
cou'd make Kings immortal, and rai&s;e triumphant Arches to Heroes, now
wants a poor &s;quare Foot of Stone, to &s;how where the A&s;hes of one of the
greate&s;t Poets, that ever was upon Earth, are depo&s;ited.</P>

<L>Before the Seas, and this Terre&s;trial Ball,</L>
<L>And Heav'ns high Canopy, that covers all,</L>
<L>One was the Face of Nature; if a Face,</L>
<L>Rather a rude and indige&s;ted Ma&s;s:</L>
<L>A lifele&s;s Lump, unfa&s;hion'd, and unfram'd,</L>
<L>Of jarring Seeds; and ju&s;tly <HI>Chaos</HI> nam'd.</L>
<L>No Sun was lighted up, the World to view;</L>
<L>No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew:</L>
<L>Nor yet was Earth &s;u&s;pended in the Sky;</L>
<L>Nor pois'd, did on her own Foundations lye:</L>
<L>Nor Seas about the Shoars their Arms had thrown;</L>
<L>But Earth and Air and Water were in one.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="33">
Thus Air was void of Light, and Earth un&s;table,</L>
<L>And Waters dark Aby&s;s unnavigable.</L>
<L>No certain Form on any was impre&s;t;</L>
<L>All were confus'd, and each di&s;turb'd the re&s;t.</L>
<L>For hot and cold were in one Body fixt;</L>
<L>And &s;oft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.</L>
<L>But God or Nature, while they thus contend,</L>
<L>To the&s;e inte&s;tine Di&s;cords put an end:</L>
<L>Then Earth from Air, and Seas from Earth were driv'n,</L>
<L>And gro&s;&s;er Air &s;unk from Aetherial Heav'n.</L>
<L>Thus di&s;embroil'd, they take their proper place;</L>
<L>The next of kin, contiguou&s;ly embrace;</L>
<L>And foes are &s;under'd, by a larger &s;pace.</L>
<L>The force of Fire a&s;cended fir&s;t on high,</L>
<L>And took its dwelling in the vaulted Sky:</L>
<L>Then Air &s;ucceeds, in Lightne&s;s next to Fire;</L>
<L>Who&s;e Atoms from unactive Earth retire.</L>
<L>Earth &s;inks beneath, and draws a numerous throng</L>
<L>Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy Seeds along.</L>
<L>About her Coa&s;ts, unruly Waters roar;</L>
<L>And, ri&s;ing on a ridge, in&s;ult the Shoar.</L>
<L>Thus when the God, whatever God was he,</L>
<L>Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree,</L>
<L>That no unequal Portions might be found,</L>
<L>He moulded Earth into a &s;pacious Round:</L>
<L>Then with a breath, he gave the Winds to blow;</L>
<L>And bad the congregated Waters flow.</L>
<L>He adds the running Springs, and &s;tanding Lakes;</L>
<L>And bounding Banks for winding Rivers makes.</L>
<L>Some part, in Earth are &s;wallow'd up, the mo&s;t</L>

He &s;hades the Woods, the Vallies he re&s;trains</L>

<L>The Sun with Rays, directly darting down,</L>
<L>Fires all beneath, and fries the middle Zone:</L>
<L>The two beneath the di&s;tant Poles, complain</L>
<L>Of endle&s;s Winter, and perpetual Rain.</L>
<L>Betwixt th' extreams, two happier Climates hold</L>
<L>The Temper that partakes of Hot and Cold.</L>
<L>The Fields of liquid Air, inclo&s;ing all,</L>
<L>Surround the Compa&s;s of this Earthly Ball:</L>

<L>Thick Clouds are &s;pread, and Storms engender there,</L>
<L>And Thunder's Voice, which wretched Mortals fear,</L>

<L>Nor were tho&s;e blu&s;tring Brethren left at large,</L>

<L>Which wi&s;e <HI>Prometheus</HI> temper'd into pa&s;te,</L>

<L>Thus, while the mute Creation downward bend</L>

<L>Man looks aloft; and with erected Eyes</L>

<L>Yet fearing Idlene&s;s, the Nur&s;e of Ill,</L>
<L>In Sculpture exercis'd his happy Skill;</L>
<L>And carv'd in Iv'ry &s;uch a Maid, &s;o fair,</L>
<L>As Nature could not with his Art compare,</L>
<L>Were &s;he to work; but in her own Defence</L>
<L>Mu&s;t take her Pattern here, and copy hence.</L>
<L>Pleas'd with his Idol, he commends, admires,</L>
<L>Adores; and la&s;t, the Thing ador'd, de&s;ires.</L>
<L>A very Virgin in her Face was &s;een,</L>
<L>And had &s;he mov'd, a living Maid had been:</L>
<L>One wou'd have thought &s;he cou'd have &s;tirr'd, but &s;trove</L>
<L>With Mode&s;ty, and was a&s;ham'd to move.</L>
<L>Art hid with Art, &s;o well perform'd the Cheat,</L>
<L>It caught the Carver with his own Deceit:</L>
<L>He knows 'tis Madne&s;s, yet he mu&s;t adore,</L>
<L>And &s;till the more he knows it, loves the more:</L>
<L>The Fle&s;h, or what &s;o &s;eems, he touches oft,</L>
<L>Which feels &s;o &s;mooth, that he believes it &s;oft.</L>
<L>Fir'd with this Thought, at once he &s;train'd the Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And on the Lips a burning Ki&s;s impre&s;s'd.</L>
<L>'Tis true, the harden'd Brea&s;t re&s;i&s;ts the Gripe,</L>

<L>But when, retiring back, he look'd again,</L>
<L>To think it Iv'ry, was a Thought too mean:</L>

<L>His Hands had made a Dint, and hurt his Maid:</L>

<L>With Flatt'ry now he &s;eeks her Mind to move,</L>
<L>And now with Gifts, (the pow'rful Bribes of Love:)</L>
<L>He furni&s;hes her Clo&s;et fir&s;t; and fills</L>
<L>The crowded Shelves with Rarities of Shells;</L>
<L>Adds Orient Pearls, which from the Conchs he drew,</L>
<L>And all the &s;parkling Stones of various Hue:</L>
<L>And Parrots, imitating Human Tongue,</L>
<L>And Singing-birds in Silver Cages hung;</L>
<L>And ev'ry fragrant Flow'r, and od'rous Green</L>
<L>Were &s;orted well, with Lumps of Amber laid between:</L>

<L>Thus like a Queen array'd, &s;o richly dre&s;s'd,</L>

<L>To which the <HI>Cypriots</HI> due Devotion pay;</L>
