<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING by &s;everal years of continual &s;tudy trea&s;ured in my mind a great number of principles and ideas, and ob|tained by frequent exerci&s;e the power of applying them with propriety, and combining them with readine&s;s, I re&s;olved to
<PB N="2" REF="3">
quit the univer&s;ity, where I con&s;idered my&s;elf as a gem hidden in the mine, and to mingle in the croud of publick life. I was naturally attracted by the company of tho&s;e who were of the &s;ame age with my&s;elf, and finding that my academical gravity contributed very little to my reputation, applied my faculties to jocularity and burle&s;que. Thus, in a &s;hort time, I had heated my imagination to &s;uch a &s;tate of activity and ebullition, that upon every occa&s;ion it fumed away in bur&s;ts of wit, and evaporations of gaiety. I became on a &s;udden the idol of the coffee-hou&s;e, was in one winter &s;ollicited to accept the pre&s;i|dent&s;hip of five clubs, was dragged by vio|lence to every new play, and quoted in every controver&s;y upon theatrical merit; was in every publick place &s;urrounded by a multitude of humble auditors, who retailed in other places of re&s;ort my maxims and my je&s;ts, and was boa&s;ted as their intimate and compa|nion by many, who had no other preten&s;ions to my acquaintance, than that they had drank chocolate in the &s;ame room.</P>
<P>YOU will not wonder, Mr. RAMBLER, that I mention my &s;ucce&s;s with &s;ome ap|pearance
<PB N="3" REF="4">
of triumph and elevation. Perhaps no kind of &s;uperiority is more flattering or alluring than that which is conferred by the powers of conver&s;ation, by extemporaneous &s;prightline&s;s of fancy, copiou&s;ne&s;s of lan|guage, and fertility of &s;entiment. In other exertions of genius, the greate&s;t part of the prai&s;e is unknown and unenjoyed; the wri|ter, indeed, &s;preads his reputation to a wider extent, but receives little plea&s;ure or ad|vantage from the diffu&s;ion of his name, and only obtains a kind of nominal &s;overeignty over regions which pay no tribute. The col|loquial wit has always his own radiance re|flected on him&s;elf, and enjoys all the plea&s;ure which he be&s;tows; he finds his power con|fe&s;&s;ed by every one that approaches him, &s;ees friend&s;hip kindling with rapture, and atten|tion &s;welling into prai&s;e.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire which every man feels of im|portance and e&s;teem is &s;o much gratified by finding an a&s;&s;embly, at his entrance, brighten|ed with gladne&s;s and hu&s;hed with expecta|tion, that the recollection of &s;uch di&s;tinctions can &s;carcely fail to be plea&s;ing when&s;oever it is innocent. And my con&s;cience does not re|proach
<PB N="4" REF="5">
me with any mean or criminal effects of vanity; &s;ince I always employed my influence on the &s;ide of virtue, and never &s;acrificed my under&s;tanding or my religion to the plea&s;ure of applau&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE were many whom either the de|&s;ire of enjoying my plea&s;antry, or the pride of being thought to enjoy it, brought often into my company; but I was care&s;&s;ed in a particular manner by <HI>Demochares,</HI> a gentle|man of a large e&s;tate, and a liberal di&s;po&s;i|tion. My fortune was by no means exube|rant, and therefore I was not di&s;plea&s;ed with a friend who was willing to be entertained at his own charge. I became by daily invita|tions habituated to his table, and, as he had per&s;uaded him&s;elf to believe my acquaintance nece&s;&s;ary to the character of elegance, which he was de&s;irous of e&s;tabli&s;hing, I lived in all the luxury of affluence without expence or dependence, and pa&s;&s;ed my life in a perpetual reciprocation of plea&s;ure with men whom &s;imi|litude of accompli&s;hments or de&s;ire of im|provement crouded about us.</P>
<P>BUT all power has its &s;phere of activity, beyond which it produces no effect. <HI>Demo|chares</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
being called by his affairs into the country, imagined that he &s;hould encrea&s;e his reputation and popularity by coming among his neighbours accompanied by a man who&s;e abilities were &s;o generally allowed. The re|port pre&s;ently &s;pread thro' half the county that <HI>Demochares</HI> was arrived, and had brought with him the celebrated <HI>Hilarius,</HI> by whom &s;uch merriment would be excited, as had never been enjoyed or conceived before. I knew, indeed, the purpo&s;e for which I was invited, and, as men do not look diligently out for po&s;&s;ible mi&s;carriages, was plea&s;ed to find my&s;elf courted upon principles of intere&s;t, and con&s;idered as capable of reconciling fa|ctions, compo&s;ing feuds, and uniting a whole province in &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER a few days &s;pent in adju&s;ting his dome&s;tick regulations, <HI>Demochares</HI> invited all the gentlemen of his neighbourhood to dinner, and did not forget to hint how much my pre&s;ence was expected to heighten the plea&s;ure of the fea&s;t. He informed me what prejudices my reputation had rai&s;ed in my fa|vour, and repre&s;ented the &s;atisfaction with which he &s;hould &s;ee me kindle up the blaze
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of merriment, and &s;hould remark the various effects that my fire would have upon &s;uch diver&s;ity of matter.</P>
<P>THIS declaration, by which he intended to quicken my vivacity, filled me with &s;olici|tude. I felt an ambition of &s;hining, which I never knew before; and was therefore em|barra&s;&s;ed with an unu&s;ual fear of di&s;grace. I pa&s;&s;ed the night in planning out to my&s;elf the conver&s;ation of the coming day; recol|lected all my topicks of raillery, propo&s;ed pro|per &s;ubjects of ridicule, prepared &s;mart re|plies to a thou&s;and que&s;tions, accommodated an&s;wers to imaginary repartees, and formed a magazine of remarks, apophthegms, tales, and illu&s;trations.</P>
<P>THE morning broke at la&s;t in the mid&s;t of the&s;e bu&s;y meditations. I ro&s;e with the palpitations of a champion on the day of combat; and, notwith&s;tanding all my efforts, found my &s;pirits &s;unk under the weight of expectation. The company &s;oon after began to drop in, and every one, at his entrance, was introduced to <HI>Hilarius.</HI> What concep|tion the inhabitants of this region had formed
<PB N="7" REF="8">
of a wit, I cannot yet di&s;cover, but ob&s;erved that they all &s;eemed after the regular exchange of compliments to turn away di&s;appointed, and that while we waited for dinner, they ca&s;t their eyes fir&s;t upon me, and then upon each other, like a theatrical a&s;&s;embly waiting for a &s;hew.</P>
<P>FROM the unea&s;ine&s;s of this &s;ituation, I was relieved by the dinner, and as every atten|tion was taken up by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hour, I &s;unk quietly to a level with the re&s;t of the company. But no &s;ooner were the di&s;hes re|moved, than in&s;tead of chearful confidence and familiar prattle, an univer&s;al &s;ilence again &s;hewed their expectation of &s;ome un|u&s;ual performane. My friend endeavoured to rou&s;e them by healths and que&s;tions, but they an&s;wered him with great brevity, and immediately relap&s;ed into their former taci|turnity.</P>
<P>I HAD waited in hope of &s;ome opportu|nity to divert them, but could find no pa&s;s opened for a &s;ingle &s;ally; and who can be merry without an object of mirth? After a few faint efforts, which produced neither ap|plau&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="9">
nor oppo&s;ition, I was content to min|gle with the ma&s;s, to put round the gla&s;s in &s;ilence, and &s;olace my&s;elf with my own con|templations.</P>
<P>MY friend looked round him; the gue&s;ts &s;tared at one another; and if now and then a few &s;yllables were uttered with timidity and he&s;itation, there was none ready to make any reply. All our faculties were frozen, and every minute took away from our capacity of plea&s;ing, and di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours to which &s;o much happine&s;s was decreed; the hours which had, by a kind of open proclamation, been devoted to wit, to mirth, and to <HI>Hilarius.</HI></P>
<P>AT la&s;t the night came on, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of parting freed us from the per&s;ecu|tions of each other. I heard them as they walked along the court murmuring at the lo&s;s of the day, and enquiring whether any man would pay a &s;econd vi&s;it to a hou&s;e haunted by a wit.</P>
<P><HI>Demochares,</HI> who&s;e Benevolence is greater than his penetration, having flattered his hopes with the &s;econdary honour which he
<PB N="9" REF="10">
was to gain by my &s;prightline&s;s and elegance, and the affection with which he &s;hould be fol|lowed for a perpetual banquet of gaiety, was not able to conceal his vexation and re&s;ent|ment, nor would ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded but that I had &s;acrificed his intere&s;t to fullenne&s;s and caprice, had &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to di&s;gu&s;t his gue&s;ts, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my powers of de|lighting, in ob&s;tinate and premeditated &s;ilence. I am informed that the reproach of their ill reception is divided by the gentlemen of the country between us; &s;ome being of opinion that my friend is deluded by an impo&s;tor, who, though he has found &s;ome art of gaining his favour, is afraid to &s;peak before men of more penetration; and others concluding that I think only <HI>London</HI> the proper theatre of my abilities, and di&s;dain to exert my ge|nius for the prai&s;e of ru&s;ticks.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, Mr. RAMBLER, that it has &s;ometimes happened to others, who have the good or ill fortune to be celebrated for wits, to fall under the &s;ame cen&s;ures upon the like occa&s;ions. I hope therefore that you will pre|vent any mi&s;repre&s;entations of &s;uch failures, by remarking that invention is not wholly at
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the command of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; that the power of plea&s;ing is very often ob&s;tructed by the de&s;ire; that all expectation le&s;&s;ens &s;urprize, yet &s;ome &s;urprize is nece&s;&s;ary to gaiety; and that tho&s;e who de&s;ire to partake of the plea&s;ure of wit mu&s;t contribute to its pro|duction, &s;ince the mind &s;tagnates without external ventilation, and that efferve&s;cence of the fancy, which fla&s;hes into tran&s;port, can be ra&s;ed only by the infu&s;ion of di&s;&s;imi|lar ideas.</P>

<P>"LIFE," &s;ays <HI>Seneca,</HI> "is a voyage, in the progre&s;s of which, we are perpe|tually changing our &s;cenes; we fir&s;t leave childhood behind us, then youth, then the
<PB N="11" REF="12">
years of ripened manhood, then the better and more plea&s;ing part of old age." The peru&s;al of this pa&s;&s;age, having excited in me a train of reflections on the &s;tate of man, the ince&s;&s;ant fluctuation of his wi&s;hes, the gra|dual change of his di&s;po&s;ition to all external objects, and the thoughtle&s;ne&s;s with which he floats along the &s;tream of time, I &s;unk in|to a &s;lumber amid&s;t my meditations, and, on a &s;udden, found my ears filled with the tu|mult of labour, the &s;houts of alacrity, the &s;hrieks of alarm, the whi&s;tle of winds, and the da&s;h of waters.</P>
<P>MY a&s;toni&s;hment for a time repre&s;&s;ed my curio&s;ity; but &s;oon recovering my&s;elf &s;o far as to enquire whither we were going, and what was the cau&s;e of &s;uch clamour and con|fu&s;ion, I was told that they were launching out into the <HI>ocean of life</HI>; that we had already pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of infancy, in which mul|titudes had peri&s;hed, &s;ome by the weakne&s;s and fragility of their ve&s;&s;els, and more by the folly, perver&s;ene&s;s, or negligence, of tho&s;e who undertook to &s;teer them; and that we were now on the main &s;ea, abandoned to the winds and billows, without any other means
<PB N="12" REF="13">
of &s;ecurity, than the care of the pilot, whom it was always in our power to choo&s;e among great numbers that offered their direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I THEN looked round with anxious eager|ne&s;s: and fir&s;t turning my eyes behind me, &s;aw a &s;tream flowing through flowery i&s;lands, which every one that &s;ailed along &s;eemed to behold with plea&s;ure; but no &s;ooner touch|ed, than the current, which, though not noi&s;y or turbulent, was yet irre&s;i&s;tible, bore him away. Beyond the&s;e i&s;lands all was dark|ne&s;s, nor could any of the pa&s;&s;engers de&s;cribe the &s;hore at which he fir&s;t embarked.</P>
<P>BEFORE me, and each other &s;ide, was an expan&s;e of waters violently agitated, and covered with &s;o thick a mi&s;t, that the mo&s;t per&s;picacious eye could &s;ee but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirl|pools, for many &s;unk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full &s;ails, and in|&s;ulting tho&s;e whom they had left behind. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and &s;o thick the darkne&s;s, that no caution could confer &s;ecurity. Yet there were many, who,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
by fal&s;e intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirlpools, or by violence pu&s;hed tho&s;e whom they found in their way again&s;t the rocks.</P>
<P>THE current was invariable and in&s;ur|mountable; but though it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ail again&s;t it, or to return to the place that was once pa&s;&s;ed, yet it was not &s;o violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity or courage, &s;ince, though none could retreat back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by oblique direction.</P>
<P>IT was, however, not very common to &s;teer with much care or prudence; for, by &s;ome univer&s;al infatuation, every man appear|ed to think him&s;elf &s;afe, though he &s;aw his con&s;orts every moment &s;inking round him; and no &s;ooner had the waves clo&s;ed over them, than their fate and their mi&s;conduct were forgotten; the voyage was per&s;ued with the &s;ame jocund confidence; every man congratulated him&s;elf upon the &s;oundne&s;s of his ve&s;&s;el, and believed him&s;elf able to &s;tem the whirlpool in which his friend was &s;wallow|ed, or glide over the rocks on which he was
<PB N="14" REF="15">
da&s;hed; nor was it often ob&s;erved that the &s;ight of a wreck made any man change his cour&s;e; if he turned a&s;ide for a moment, he &s;oon forgot the rudder, and left him&s;elf again to the di&s;po&s;al of chance.</P>
<P>THIS negligence did not proceed from in|difference, or from wearine&s;s of their pre&s;ent condition; for not one of tho&s;e, who thus ru&s;hed upon de&s;truction, failed, when he was &s;inking, to call loudly upon his a&s;&s;ociates for that help which could not now be given him; and many &s;pent their la&s;t moments in caution|ing others again&s;t the folly, by which they were intercepted in the mid&s;t of their cour&s;e. Their benevolence was &s;ometimes prai&s;ed, but their admonitions were unregarded.</P>
<P>THE ve&s;&s;els, in which we had embarked, being confe&s;&s;edly unequal to the turbulence of the &s;tream of life, were vi&s;ibly impaired in the cour&s;e of the voyage; &s;o that every pa&s;&s;enger was certain, that how long &s;oever he might, by favourable accidents, or by ince&s;&s;ant vigi|lance, be pre&s;erved, he mu&s;t &s;ink at la&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS nece&s;&s;ity of peri&s;hing might have been
<PB N="15" REF="16">
expected to &s;adden the gay, and intimidate the daring, at lea&s;t to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual torments, and hid|der them from any enjoyment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the &s;olace of their labours; yet in effect none &s;eemed le&s;s to expect de&s;truction than tho&s;e to whom it was mo&s;t dreadful; they all had the art of concealing their danger from them&s;elves; and tho&s;e who knew their inability to bear the &s;ight of the terrors that embarra&s;&s;ed their way, took care never to look forward, but found &s;ome amu&s;ement for the pre&s;ent moment, and generally enter|tained them&s;elves by playing with HOPE, who was the con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociate of the voyage of life.</P>
<P>YET all that HOPE ventured to promi&s;e, even to tho&s;e whom &s;he favoured mo&s;t, was, not that they &s;hould e&s;cape, but that they &s;hould &s;ink la&s;t; and with this promi&s;e every one was &s;atisfied, though he laughed at the re&s;t for &s;eeming to believe it. HOPE, indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of her com|panions; for in proportion as their ve&s;&s;els grew leaky, &s;he redoubled her a&s;&s;urances of
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;afety; and none were more bu&s;y in making provi&s;ions for a long voyage, than they, whom all but them&s;elves &s;aw likely to peri&s;h &s;oon by irreparable decay.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the current of life was the <HI>gulph of</HI> INTEMPERANCE, a dreadful whirl|pool, inter&s;per&s;ed with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the tops covered with herbage, on which EASE &s;pread couches of repo&s;e, and with &s;hades, where PLEASURE warbled the &s;ong of invitation. Within &s;ight of the&s;e rocks all who &s;ailed on the ocean of life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s. REASON, indeed, was always at hand to &s;teer the pa&s;&s;engers through a narrow out|let by which they might e&s;cape; but very few could, by her intreaties or remon&s;tran|ces, be induced to put the rudder into her hand, without &s;tipulating that &s;he &s;hould ap|proach &s;o near unto the rocks of PLEASURE, that they might &s;olace them&s;elves with a &s;hort enjoyment of that delicious region, after which they always determined to per&s;ue their cour&s;e without any other deviation.</P>
<P>REASON was too often prevailed upon &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="18">
far by the&s;e promi&s;es, as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulph of IN|TEMPERANCE, where, indeed, the circum|volution was weak, but yet interrupted the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el, and drew it, by in&s;en|&s;ible rotations, towards the centre. She then repented her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to retreat; but the draught of the gulph was generally too &s;trong to be over|come; and the pa&s;&s;enger, having danced in circles with a plea&s;ing and giddy velocity, was at la&s;t overwhelmed and lo&s;t. Tho&s;e few whom REASON was able to extricate, generally &s;uffered &s;o many &s;hocks upon the points which &s;hot out from the rocks of PLEASURE, that they were unable to con|tinue their cour&s;e with the &s;ame &s;trength and facility as before, but floated along timorou&s;ly and feebly, endangered by every breeze, and &s;hattered by every ruffle of the water, till they &s;unk, by &s;low degrees, after long &s;trug|gles, and innumerable expedients, always re|pining at their own folly, and warning others again&s;t the fir&s;t approach to the gulph of IN|TEMPERANCE.</P>
<P>THERE were arti&s;ts who profe&s;&s;ed to re|pair
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the breaches and &s;top the leaks of the ve&s;&s;els which had been &s;hattered on the rocks of PLEASURE. Many appeared to have great confidence in their &s;kill, and &s;ome, indeed, were pre&s;erved by it from &s;inking, who had received only a &s;ingle blow; but I remarked that few ve&s;&s;els la&s;ted long which had been much repaired, nor was it found that the arti&s;ts them&s;elves continued afloat longer than tho&s;e who had lea&s;t of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE only advantage, which, in the voy|age of life, the cautious had above the negli|gent, was, that they &s;unk later, and more &s;uddenly; for they pa&s;&s;ed forward till they had &s;ometimes &s;een all tho&s;e in who&s;e com|pany they had i&s;&s;ued from the &s;treights of in|fancy, peri&s;h in the way, and at la&s;t were over&s;et by a cro&s;s breeze, without the toil of re&s;i&s;tance, or the angui&s;h of expectation. But &s;uch as had often fallen again&s;t the rocks of PLEASURE, commonly &s;ub&s;ided by &s;en&s;ible degrees, contended long with the encroach|ing waters, and hara&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by la|bours that &s;carce HOPE her&s;elf could flatter with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
AS I was looking upon the various fate of the multitude about me, I was &s;uddenly al|armed with an admonition from &s;ome un|known Power, "Gaze not idly upon others when thou thy&s;elf art &s;inking. Whence is this thoughtle&s;s tranquillity, when thou and they are equally endangered?" I look|ed, and &s;eeing the gulph of INTEMPE|RANCE before me, &s;tarted and awaked.</P>

<P>THE de&s;ire of knowledge, though it is of|ten animated by extrin&s;ick and adventi|tious motives, &s;eems on many occa&s;ions to operate without &s;ubordination to any other principle; we are eager to &s;ee and hear, with|out intention of referring our ob&s;erva|tions to a farther end; we climb a mountain for a pro&s;pect of the plain; we run to the &s;trand in a &s;torm, that we may contemplate the agitation of the water; we range from city to city, though we profe&s;s neither archi|tecture nor fortification; we cro&s;s &s;eas only to view nature in nakedne&s;s, or magnificence in ruins; we are equally allured by novelty of every kind, by a de&s;art or a palace, a ca|taract or a cavern, by every thing rude, and every thing poli&s;hed, every thing great and every thing little; we do not &s;ee a thicket

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;ion is, perhaps, regularly height|ened in proportion as the powers of the mind are elevated and enlarged. <HI>Lucan</HI> there|fore introduces <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;peaking with dignity &s;uitable to the grandeur of his de&s;igns and the extent of his capacity, when he declares to the high prie&s;t of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that he has no de&s;ire equally powerful with that of finding the origin of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and that he would quit all the projects of the civil war for a &s;ight of tho&s;e fountains which had been &s;o long con|cealed. And <HI>Homer,</HI> when he would furni&s;h the <HI>Sirens</HI> with a temptation, to which his hero, renowned for wi&s;dom, might yield without di&s;grace, makes them declare, that none ever departed from them but with en|crea&s;e of knowledge.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, &s;carce any kind of ideal acquirement which may not be applied to &s;ome u&s;e, or which may not at lea&s;t gratify pride with occa&s;ional &s;uperiority; but who|ever attends the motions of his own mind
<PB N="22" REF="23">
will find, that upon the fir&s;t appearance of an object, or the fir&s;t &s;tart of a que&s;tion, his inclination to a nearer view, or more accu|rate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, precedes all thoughts of pro|fit, or of competition; and that his de&s;ires take wing by in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e, though their flight may be invigorated, or their ef|forts renewed, by &s;ub&s;equent con&s;iderations. The gratification of curio&s;ity rather frees us from unea&s;ine&s;s than confers plea&s;ure; we are more pained by ignorance than delighted by in&s;truction. Curio&s;ity is the thir&s;t of the &s;oul; it inflames and torments us, and makes us ta&s;te every thing with joy, however other|wi&s;e in&s;ipid, by which it may be quenched.</P>
<P>IT is evident that the earlie&s;t &s;earchers after knowledge mu&s;t have propo&s;ed knowledge only as their reward; and that &s;cience, though perhaps the nur&s;ling of intere&s;t, was the daughter of curio&s;ity: for who can believe that they who fir&s;t watched the cour&s;e of the &s;tars, fore&s;aw the u&s;e of their di&s;coveries to the facilitation of commerce, or the men|&s;uration of time? They were delighted with the &s;plendor of the nocturnal &s;kies, they found that the lights changed their places, what they
<PB N="23" REF="24">
admired they were anxious to under&s;tand, and in time traced their revolutions.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, beings in the form of men, who appear &s;atisfied with their intel|lectual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;eem to live without de&s;ire of enlarging their conceptions; before whom the world pa&s;&s;es without notice, and who are equally unmoved by nature or by art.</P>
<P>THIS negligence is &s;ometimes only the temporary effect of a predominant pa&s;&s;ion; a lover finds no inclination to travel any path, but that which leads to the habitation of his mi&s;tre&s;s; a trader can &s;pare little attention to common occurrences, when his fortune is endangered by a &s;torm. It is frequently the con&s;equence of a total immer&s;ion in &s;en&s;ua|lity: corporeal plea&s;ures may be indulged till the memory of every other kind of hap|pine&s;s is obliterated; the mind long habitu|ated to a lethargick and quie&s;cent &s;tate, is un|willing to wake to the toil of thinking; and though &s;he may &s;ometimes be di&s;turbed by the obtru&s;ion of new ideas, &s;hrinks back again to ignorance and re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
BUT, indeed, if we except them to whom the continual ta&s;k of procuring the &s;upports of life, denies all opportunities of deviation from their own narrow track, the number of &s;uch as live without the ardour of enquiry, is very &s;mall, though many content them|&s;elves with cheap amu&s;ements, and wa&s;te their lives in re&s;earches of no importance.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;nare more dangerous to bu&s;y and excur&s;ive minds, than the cobwebs of petty inqui&s;itivene&s;s, which entangle them in trivial employments and minute &s;tudies, and detain them in a middle &s;tate between the tediou&s;ne&s;s of total inactivity, and the fatigue of laborious efforts, enchant them at once with ea&s;e and novelty, and vitiate them with the luxury of learning. The nece&s;&s;ity of do|ing &s;omething, and the fear of undertaking much, &s;inks the hi&s;torian to a genealogi&s;t, the philo&s;opher to a journali&s;t of the weather, and the mathematician to a con&s;tructer of dials.</P>
<P>IT is happy when tho&s;e who cannot con|tent them&s;elves to be idle, nor re&s;olve to be
<PB N="25" REF="26">
indu&s;trious, are at lea&s;t employed without injury to others; but it &s;eldom happens that we can contain our&s;elves long in a neutral &s;tate, or forbear to &s;ink into vice, when we are no longer &s;oaring towards virtue.</P>
<P>NUGACULUS was di&s;tingui&s;hed in his ear|lier years by an uncommon liveline&s;s of imagi|nation, quickne&s;s of &s;agacity, and extent of knowledge. When after having pa&s;&s;ed through the u&s;ual methods of education, he entered into life, he applied him&s;elf with par|ticular inqui&s;itivene&s;s to examine the various motives of human actions, the complicated influence of mingled affections, the different modifications of intere&s;t and ambition, and the various cau&s;es of mi&s;carriage and &s;ucce&s;s both in public and private affairs.</P>
<P>THOUGH his friends did not di&s;cover to what purpo&s;e all the&s;e ob&s;ervations were col|lected, or how <HI>Nugaculus</HI> would much im|prove his virtue or his fortune by an ince&s;&s;ant attention to changes of countenance, bur&s;ts of incon&s;ideration, &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion, and all the other ca&s;ualties by which he u&s;ed to trace a character, yet they could not deny the
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;tudy of human nature to be worthy of a wi&s;e man; they therefore flattered his vanity, applauded his di&s;coveries, and li&s;tened with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty to his lectures on the un|certainty of inclination, the weakne&s;s of re|&s;olves, and the in&s;tability of temper, to his account of the various motives which agitate the mind, and his ridicule of the modern dream of a ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SUCH was the fir&s;t incitement of <HI>Nuga|culus</HI> to a clo&s;e in&s;pection into the conduct of mankind. He had no intere&s;t in view, and therefore no de&s;ign of &s;upplantation; he had no malevolence, and therefore detected faults without any intention to expo&s;e them; but having once found the art of engaging his attention upon others, he had no inclination to call it back to him&s;elf, but has pa&s;&s;ed his time in keeping a watchful eye upon every ri&s;ing character, and lived upon a &s;mall e&s;tate without any thought of encrea&s;ing it.</P>
<P>HE is, by continual application, become a general ma&s;ter of &s;ecret hi&s;tory, and can give an account of the intrigues, private marriages, competitions, and &s;tratagems of
<PB N="27" REF="28">
half a century. He knows the mortgages upon every man's e&s;tate, the terms upon which every &s;pendthrift rai&s;es his money, the real and reputed fortune of every lady, the jointure &s;tipulated by every contract, and the expectations of every family from maiden aunts and childle&s;s acquaintances. He can relate the economy of every hou&s;e, knows how much one man's cellar is robbed by his butler, and the land of another underlet by his &s;teward; he can tell where the manor|hou&s;e is falling, though large &s;ums are yearly paid for repairs; and where the tenants are felling woods without the con&s;ent of the owner.</P>
<P>TO obtain all this intelligence he is inad|vertently guilty of a thou&s;and acts of trea|chery. He &s;ees no man's &s;ervant without draining him of his tru&s;t; he enters no family without flattering the children into di&s;co|veries; he is a perpetual &s;py upon the doors of his neighbours; and knows, by long ex|perience, at whatever di&s;tance, the looks of a creditor, a borrower, a lover, and a pimp.</P>
<P>NUGACULUS is not ill-natured, and there|fore
<PB N="28" REF="29">
his indu&s;try has not hither to been very mi&s;|chievous to others, or dangerous to him&s;elf; but &s;ince he cannot enjoy this knowledge but by di&s;covering it, and, if he had no other mo|tive to loquacity, is obliged to traffick like the chymi&s;ts, and purcha&s;e one &s;ecret with another, he is every day more hated as he is more known; for he is con&s;idered by great numbers as one that has their fame and their happine&s;s in his power, and no man can much love him of whom he lives in fear.</P>
<P>THUS has an intention, innocent at fir&s;t, if not laudable, the intention of regulating his own behaviour by the experience of others, betrayed <HI>Nugaculus</HI> not only to a fooli&s;h, but vicious wa&s;te of a life which might have been honourably pa&s;&s;ed in public &s;ervices, or dome|&s;tic virtues.

<P>THE apparent in&s;ufficiency of every individual to his own happine&s;s or &s;afety, compels us to &s;eek from one another a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport. The nece&s;&s;ity of joint efforts for the execution of any great or ex|ten&s;ive de&s;ign, the variety of powers di&s;|&s;eminated in the &s;pecies, and the propor|tion between the defects and excellencies of different per&s;ons, demand an interchange of help, and communication of intelligence, and by frequent reciprocations of beneficence, unite mankind in &s;ociety and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IF it can be imagined that there ever was a time when the inhabitants of any country were in a &s;tate of equality, without di&s;tinction of rank, or peculiarity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it is rea|&s;onable to believe that every man was then loved in proportion as he could contribute by his &s;trength, or his &s;kill, to the &s;upply of natu|ral
<PB N="30" REF="31">
wants; that there was little room for pee|vi&s;h di&s;like, or capricious favour; that the affe|ction then admitted into the heart, was rather e&s;teem than tenderne&s;s; and that kindne&s;s was only purcha&s;ed by benefits. But when by force or policy, by wi&s;dom or by fortune, property and &s;uperiority were introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o that many were condemned to labour for the &s;upport of a few, then they who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;welled above their wants, naturally laid out their &s;uper fluities upon plea&s;ure; and tho&s;e who could not gain friend&s;hip by nece&s;|&s;ary offices, endeavoured to promote their in|tere&s;t by luxurious gratifications, and to create need, which they might be courted to &s;up|ply.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ires of mankind are &s;o much more numerous than their attainments, and the capacity of imagination &s;o much larger than actual enjoyment, that no power of be&s;towing can equal expectation. Every di&s;tant appear|ance of advantage mu&s;t therefore excite &s;trug|gles and competitions; that which can be ob|tained only by one will be de&s;ired by multi|tudes, while there remain multitudes un&s;atisfied with their allotment; and he who cannot hope
<PB N="31" REF="32">
to &s;ucceed by real &s;ervices, and either finds no room for the exertion of great qualities, or perceives him&s;elf excelled by his rivals, will have recour&s;e to other expedients, will endeavour to become agreeable where he can|not be important, and learn, by degrees, to number the <HI>art of plea&s;ing</HI> among the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;tudies, and mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>THIS art, like others, is cultivated in pro|portion to its u&s;efulne&s;s, and will always flouri&s;h mo&s;t where it is mo&s;t rewarded: for this rea&s;on we find it practi&s;ed with great a&s;|&s;iduity under ab&s;olute governments, where honours and riches are in the hands of one man, whom all endeavour to propitiate, and who &s;oon becomes &s;o much accu&s;tomed to compliance and officiou&s;ne&s;s, as not ea&s;ily to find, in the mo&s;t delicate addre&s;s, that no|velty which is nece&s;&s;ary to procure attention.</P>
<P>IT is di&s;covered by a very few experiments, that no man is much plea&s;ed with a compa|nion, who does not encrea&s;e, in &s;ome re|&s;pect, his fondne&s;s of him&s;elf; and, there|fore, he that wi&s;hes rather to be led forward to pro&s;perity by the gentle hand of favour,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
than to force his way by labour and merit, mu&s;t con&s;ider with more care how to di&s;play his patron's excellencies than his own; that whenever he approaches, he may fill the ima|gination with plea&s;ing dreams, and cha&s;e away di&s;gu&s;t and wearine&s;s by a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of delightful images.</P>
<P>THIS may, indeed, &s;ometimes be effected by turning the attention upon advantages which are really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or upon pro&s;pects which rea&s;on &s;preads before hope; for, who|ever can de&s;erve or require to be courted has generally, either from nature or from for|tune, gifts, which he may review with &s;ati&s;|faction, and of which when he is artfully re|called to the contemplation, he will &s;eldom be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e who have once degraded their under&s;tanding to an application only to the pa&s;&s;ions, and who have learned to derive hope from any other &s;ources than indu&s;try and virtue, &s;eldom retain dignity and magnani|mity &s;ufficient to defend them again&s;t the con|&s;tant recurrence of temptation to fal&s;hood. He that is too de&s;irous to be loved will &s;oon
<PB N="33" REF="34">
learn to flatter, and when he has exhau&s;ted all the variations of hone&s;t prai&s;e, and can de|light no longer with the civility of truth, he will invent new topics of panegyric, and break out into raptures at virtues and beauties con|ferred by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE drudgeries of dependence would, in|deed, be aggravated by hopele&s;ne&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s, if no indulgence was allowed to adulation. He that will ob&s;tinately confine his patron to hear only the commendations which he de|&s;erves, will &s;oon be forced to give way to others that regale him with more compa&s;s of mu&s;ic. The greate&s;t human virtue bears no proportion to human vanity. We always think our&s;elves better than we are, and are generally de&s;irous that others &s;hould think us &s;till better than we think our&s;elves. To prai&s;e us for actions, or di&s;po&s;itions, which de&s;erve prai&s;e, is not to confer a benefit, but to pay a tribute. We have always preten&s;ions to fame, which, in our own hearts, we know to be di&s;putable, and which we are de&s;irous to &s;trengthen by a new fuffrage; we have always hopes which we &s;u&s;pect to be falla|cious,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
and of which we eagerly &s;natch at every confirmation.</P>
<P>IT may, indeed, be proper to make the fir&s;t approaches under the conduct of truth, and to &s;ecure credit to future encomiums, by &s;uch prai&s;e as may be ratified by the con|&s;cience; but the mind once habituated to the lu&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of eulogy, becomes in a &s;hort time nice and fa&s;tidious, and like a vitiated palate is ince&s;&s;antly calling for higher grati|fications.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely credible how far di&s;cern|ment may be dazzled by the mi&s;t of pride, and wi&s;dom infatuated by the intoxica|tion of flattery; or how low the genius may de&s;cend by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gradations of &s;ervility, and how &s;wiftly it may fall down the preci|pice of fal&s;hood. No man can, indeed, ob|&s;erve without indignation, on what names, both of antient and modern times, the ut|mo&s;t exuberance of prai&s;e has been lavi&s;hed, and by what hands it has been be&s;towed. It has never yet been found, that the tyrant, the plunderer, the oppre&s;&s;or, the mo&s;t hate|ful of the hateful, the mo&s;t profligate of the
<PB N="35" REF="36">
profligate, have been denied any celebrations which they were willing to purcha&s;e, or that wickedne&s;s and folly have not found corre|&s;pondent flatterers through all their &s;ubordi|nations, except when they have been a&s;&s;oci|ated with avarice or poverty, and have want|ed either inclination or ability to hire a pane|gyri&s;t.</P>
<P>AS there is no character &s;o deformed as to fright away from it the pro&s;titutes of prai&s;e, there is no degree of encomia&s;tic veneration which pride has refu&s;ed. The emperors of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;uffered them&s;elves to be wor&s;hiped in their lives with altars and &s;acrifice; and in an age more enlightened the terms peculiar to the prai&s;e and wor&s;hip of the Supreme Being, have been applied to wretches whom it was the reproach of humanity to number among men; and whom nothing but riches or power hindered tho&s;e that read or wrote their deifi|cation, from hunting into the toils of ju&s;tice, as di&s;turbers of the peace of nature.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, many among the poe|tical flatterers, who mu&s;t be re&s;igned to in|famy without vindication, and whom we mu&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="37">
confe&s;s to have de&s;erted the cau&s;e of virtue for pay; They have committed, again&s;t full conviction, the crime of obliterating the di|&s;tinctions between good and evil, and, in|&s;tead of oppo&s;ing the encroachments of vice, have incited her progre&s;s, and celebrated her conque&s;ts. But there is a lower cla&s;s of &s;y|cophants, who&s;e under&s;tanding has not made them capable of equal guilt. Every man of high rank is &s;urrounded with numbers, who have no other rule of thought or action, than his maxims, and his conduct; whom the honour of being numbered among his ac|quaintance, reconciles to all his vices, and all his ab&s;urdities; and who ea&s;ily per&s;uade them|&s;elves to e&s;teem him, by who&s;e regard they con&s;ider them&s;elves as di&s;tingui&s;hed and exalt|ed.</P>
<P>IT is dangerous for mean minds to ven|ture them&s;elve within the &s;phere of greatne&s;s. Stupidity is &s;oon blinded by the &s;plendour of wealth, and cowardice is ea&s;ily fettered in the &s;hackles of dependence. To &s;olicit patron|age, is, at lea&s;t in the event, to &s;et virtue to &s;ale. None can be plea&s;ed without prai&s;e, and few can be prai&s;ed without fal&s;hood;
<PB N="37" REF="38">
few can be affiduous without &s;ervility, and none can be &s;ervile without corruption.</P>

not to appear ignorant. A place where every exuberance may be di&s;charged, and every deficiency &s;upplied, where every law|ful pa&s;&s;ion may find its gratifications, and every hone&s;t curio&s;ity receive &s;atisfaction, where the &s;tock of a nation, pecuniary and intellectual, may be brought together, and where all conditions of humanity may hope to find relief, plea&s;ure, and accommodation, mu&s;t equally de&s;erve the attention of the mer|chant and philo&s;opher, of him who mingles in the tumult of bu&s;ine&s;s, and him who only lives to amu&s;e him&s;elf with the various em|ployments and pur&s;uits of others.

<P>WHILE I was concerting this &s;plendid pro|ject, and filling my thoughts with its regula|tion, its conveniencies, its variety, and its con&s;equences, I &s;unk gradually into &s;lumber; but the &s;ame images, though le&s;s di&s;tinct, &s;till continued to float upon my fancy.

pa&s;&s;ing without confu&s;ion; every face on which I fixed my eyes, &s;eemed &s;ettled in the contemplation of &s;ome important purpo&s;e, and every foot was ha&s;tened by eagerne&s;s and expectation. I followed the croud without knowing whither I &s;hould be drawn, and re|mained a while in the unplea&s;ing &s;tate of an idler where all other beings were bu&s;y, giv|ing place every moment to tho&s;e who had more importance in their looks.

"THOU art now," replied the &s;miling power, "in the pre&s;ence of JUSTICE, and of TRUTH, whom the father of gods and men has &s;ent down to regi&s;ter the demands and preten&s;ions of mankind, that the world may at la&s;t be reduced to order, and that none may complain hereafter of be&icirc;ng doomed to ta&s;ks for which they are un|qualified, of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing faculties for which they cannot find employment, or virtues that langui&s;h unob&s;erved for want of op|portunities to exert them, of being encum|bered with &s;uperfluities which they would willingly re&s;ign, or of wa&s;ting away in de|&s;ires which ought to be &s;atisfied.

JUSTICE very mildly enquired whether he had calculated the expence of &s;uch a declara|tion? whether he had been informed what number of petitioners would &s;warm about him? whether he could di&s;tingui&s;h idlene&s;s and negligence from calamity, o&s;tentation from knowledge, or vivacity from wit? To the&s;e que&s;tions he &s;eemed not well provided with a reply, but repeated his de&s;ire to be recorded a patron.

The&s;e terms were too hard to be accepted; for what, &s;aid he, is the end of patronage, but the plea&s;ure of reading de|dications, holding multitudes in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and enjoying their hopes, their fears, and their anxiety, flattering them to a&s;&s;iduity, and, at la&s;t, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them for impatience?

<P>NOTHING is more common than to find men who&s;e works are now totally neglected, mentioned with prai&s;es by their contempora|ries, as the oracles of their age, and the legi&s;|lators of &s;cience. Curio&s;ity is naturally ex|cited, their volumes after long enquiry are found, but &s;eldom reward the labour of the &s;earch. Every period of time has produced the&s;e bubbles of artificial fame, which are
<PB N="49" REF="50">
kept up a while by the breath of fa&s;hion, and then break at once and are annihilated. The learned often bewail the lo&s;s of ancient wri|ters who&s;e characters have &s;urvived their works; but, perhaps, if we could now re|trieve them, we &s;hould find them only the <HI>Granvilles, Montagues, Stepneys,</HI> and <HI>Sheffields</HI> of their time, and wonder by what infatua|tion or caprice they could ri&s;e to notice.</P>
<P>IT cannot, however, be denied, that many have &s;unk into oblivion, whom it were unju&s;t to number with this de&s;picable cla&s;s. Vari|ous kinds of literary fame &s;eem de&s;tined to va|rious mea&s;ures of duration. Some &s;pread in|to exuberance with a very &s;peedy growth, but &s;oon wither and decay; &s;ome ri&s;e more &s;low|ly, but la&s;t long. <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> has its flowers of tran&s;ient fragrance, as well as its oaks of towering height, and its laurels of eternal verdure.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who&s;e reputation is exhau&s;t|ed in a &s;hort time by its own luxuriance, are the writers who take advantage of &s;ome pre|&s;ent incidents and characters which &s;trongly intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions, and engage univer&s;al
<PB N="50" REF="51">
attention. It is not difficult to obtain rea|ders, when we di&s;cu&s;s a que&s;tion which every one is de&s;irous to under&s;tand, which is de|bated in every a&s;&s;embly, and has divided the nation into parties; or when we di&s;play the faults or virtues of him, who&s;e public conduct has made almo&s;t every man his enemy or his friend. To the quick circulation of &s;uch pro|ductions all the motives of intere&s;t and vanity concur; the di&s;putant enlarges his knowledge, the zealot animates his pa&s;&s;ion, and every man is de&s;irous to inform him&s;elf concerning af|fairs &s;o vehemently agitated and variou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely to be imagined, through how many &s;ubordinations of intere&s;t, the ardour of party is diffu&s;ed; and what multitudes fancy them&s;elves affected by every &s;atire or pane|gyrick on a man of eminence. Whoever has, at any time, taken occa&s;ion to mention him with prai&s;e or blame, whoever happens to love or hate any of his adherents, is de&s;irous to confirm his opinion, and to &s;trengthen his party, and diligently peru&s;es every paper from which he can hope for &s;entiments like his own. An object, however &s;mall in it&s;elf, if placed
<PB N="51" REF="52">
near to the eye, will engro&s;s all the rays of light; and a tran&s;action, however trivial, &s;wells into importance, when it pre&s;&s;es im|mediately on our attention. He that &s;hall peru&s;e the political pamphlets of any pa&s;t reign, will wonder why they were &s;o generally pur|cha&s;ed, &s;o eagerly read, or &s;o loudly prai&s;ed; many of the performances which had power to inflame factions, and fill a kingdom with confu&s;ion, have now very little effect upon a frigid critick, and the time is coming, when the compo&s;itions of later hirelings &s;hall lie equally de&s;pi&s;ed and forgotten. In propor|tion, as tho&s;e who write on temporary &s;ub|jects, are exalted above their merit at fir&s;t, they are afterwards depre&s;&s;ed below it; nor can the brighte&s;t elegance of diction, or mo&s;t artful &s;ubtilty of rea&s;oning, hope for much e&s;teem from tho&s;e who&s;e regard is no longer quickened by intere&s;t or by pride.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, the fate of controverti&s;ts, even when they contend for philo&s;ophical or theological truth, to be &s;oon laid a&s;ide and &s;lighted. Either the que&s;tion is decided; and there is no more place for doubt and oppo&s;i|tion; or mankind de&s;pair of under&s;tanding it,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
and grow weary of di&s;turbance, content them|&s;elves with quiet ignorance, and refu&s;e to be hara&s;&s;ed with labours which they have no hopes of recompen&s;ing with knowledge.</P>
<P>THE authors of new di&s;coveries may &s;ure|ly expect to be reckoned among tho&s;e, who&s;e writings are &s;ecure of veneration: yet it often happens that the general reception of a doctrine ob&s;cures the books in which it was delivered. When any tenet is generally received and adopted as an incontrovertible principle, we &s;eldom look back to the arguments upon which it was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, or can bear that tediou&s;ne&s;s of deduction, and multiplicity of evidence, by which its author was forced to reconcile it to prejudice, and fortify it in the weakne&s;s of novelty again&s;t ob&s;tinacy and envy.</P>
<P>IT is well known how much of our philo|&s;ophy is derived from <HI>Boyle</HI>'s di&s;covery of the qualities of the air; yet of tho&s;e who now adopt or enlarge his theory, very few have read the detail of his experiments. His name is, indeed, reverenced; but his works are neg|lected; we are contented to know, that he
<PB N="53" REF="54">
conquered his opponents, without enquiring what cavils were produced again&s;t him, or by what proofs they were confuted.</P>
<P>SOME writers apply them&s;elves to &s;tudies boundle&s;s and inexhau&s;tible, as experiments and natural philo&s;ophy. The&s;e are always lo&s;t in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive compilations, as new advances are made, and former ob&s;ervations become more familiar. Others &s;pend their lives in remarks on language, or explanations of anti|quities, and only afford materials for lexico|graphers and commentators; the&s;e are them|&s;elves overwhelmed by &s;ub&s;equent collectors, who equally de&s;troy the memory of their pre|dece&s;&s;ors by amplification, tran&s;po&s;ition, or contraction. Every new &s;y&s;tem of nature gives birth to a &s;warm of expo&s;itors, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to explain and illu&s;trate it, and who can hope to exi&s;t no longer than the founder of their &s;ect pre&s;erves his re|putation.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, few kinds of compo|&s;ition from which an author, however learned or ingenious, can hope a long continuance of fame. He who has carefully &s;tudied human
<PB N="54" REF="55">
nature, and can well de&s;cribe it, may with mo&s;t rea&s;on flatter his ambition. <HI>Bacon,</HI> among all his preten&s;ions to the regard of po&s;terity, &s;eems to have plea&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly with his e&s;&s;ays, <HI>which come home to mens bu&s;i|ne&s;s and bo&s;oms,</HI> and of which, therefore, he declares his expectation, that they <HI>will live as long as books la&s;t.</HI> It may, however, &s;a|tisfy an hone&s;t and benevolent mind to have been u&s;eful, though le&s;s con&s;picuous; nor will he that extends his hopes to higher rewards, be &s;o much anxious to obtain prai&s;e, as to di&s;charge the duty which Pro|vidence a&s;&s;igns him.</P>

<P>THOUGH, as my mamma tells me, I am too young to talk at the table, I have great plea&s;ure in li&s;tening to the conver|&s;ation of learned men, e&s;pecially when they di&s;cour&s;e of things which I do not under&s;tand; and have, therefore, been of late particularly delighted with many di&s;putes about the <HI>alter|ation of the &s;tile,</HI> which, they &s;ay, is to be made by act of parliament.</P>
<P>ONE day, when my mamma was gone out of the room, I a&s;ked a very great &s;cholar what the &s;tile was. He told me, he was afraid I &s;hould hardly under&s;tand him when he in|formed me, that it was the &s;tated and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed method of computing time. It was not,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
indeed, likely that I &s;hould under&s;tand him; for I never yet knew time computed in my life, nor can imagine why we &s;hould be at &s;o much trouble to count what we cannot keep. He did not tell me whether we are to count the time pa&s;t, or the time to come; but I have con&s;idered them both by my&s;elf, and think it as fooli&s;h to count time that is gone, as money that is &s;pent; and as for the time which is to come, it only &s;eems farther off by counting; and therefore when any plea&s;ure is promi&s;ed me, I always think of the time as little as I can.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ince li&s;tened very attentively to every one that talked upon this &s;ubject, of whom the greater part &s;eem not to under|&s;tand it better than my&s;elf; for though they often hint how much the nation has been mi&s;|taken, and rejoice that we are at la&s;t grow|ing wi&s;er than our ance&s;tors, I have never been able to di&s;cover from them, that any body has died &s;ooner or been married later for counting time wrong; and, therefore, I be|gan to fancy, that there was great bu&s;tle with little con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="59">
AT la&s;t two friends of my papa, Mr. <HI>Cycle</HI> and Mr. <HI>Starlight,</HI> being, it &s;eems, both of high learning, and able to make an almanack, began to talk about the new &s;tile.

When there has been a rout at mamma's, I have thought one night of confu&s;ion worth a thou&s;and nights of re&s;t; and &s;urely if I can but &s;ee a year of confu&s;ion, a whole year, of cards in one room, and dancings in another, here a fea&s;t, and there a ma&s;querade, and plays, and coaches, and hurries, and me&s;&s;ages, and milan|ers, and raps at the door, and vi&s;its, and fro|licks, and new fa&s;hions, I &s;hall not care what they do with the re&s;t of the time, nor whe|ther they count it by the old &s;tile or the new; for I am re&s;olved to break loo&s;e from the nur&s;ery in the tumult, and play my part among the re&s;t; and it will be &s;trange if I cannot get a hu&s;band and a chariot in the year of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
CYCLE, who is neither &s;o young nor &s;o hand&s;ome as <HI>Starlight,</HI> very gravely main|tained, that all the perplexity may be avoid|ed by leaping over eleven days in the reckon|ing; and indeed, if it &s;hould come only to this, I think the new &s;tile is a delightful thing; for my mamma &s;ays I &s;hall go to court when I am &s;ixteen, and if they can but contrive of|ten to leap over eleven days together, the months of re&s;traint will &s;oon be at an end. It is &s;trange, that with all the plots that have been laid again&s;t time, they could never kill it by act of parliament before.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS &s;eized this morning with an unu&s;ual pen&s;ivene&s;s, and finding that books only &s;erved to heighten it, took a ramble into the fields, in hopes of relief and invigoration from the keenne&s;s of the air, and brightne&s;s of the &s;un.</P>
<P>AS I wandered wrapped up in thought, my eyes were &s;truck with the ho&s;pital for the re|ception of de&s;erted infants, which I &s;urveyed with plea&s;ure, till by a natural train of &s;enti|ment, I began to reflect on the fate of the mothers. For to what &s;helter can they fly? Only to the arms of their betrayer, which perhaps are now no longer open to receive them; and then how quick mu&s;t be the tran&s;|ition from deluded virtue to &s;hamele&s;s guilt,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
and from &s;hamele&s;s guilt to hopele&s;s wretch|edne&s;s?</P>
<P>THE angui&s;h that I felt, left me no re&s;t till had, by your means, addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the publick on behalf of tho&s;e forlorn creatures, the women of the town; who&s;e mi&s;ery here, might &s;atisfy the mo&s;t rigorous cen&s;or, and who&s;e participation of our common nature might purely induce us to endeavour, at lea&s;t, their pre&s;ervation from eternal puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THESE were all once, if not virtuous, at lea&s;t innocent; and might &s;till have continued blamele&s;s and ea&s;y, but for the arts and infi|nuations of tho&s;e who&s;e rank, fortune, or education, furni&s;hed them with means to cor|rupt or to delude them. Let the libertine reflect a moment on the &s;ituation of that wo|man, who being for&s;aken by her betrayer, is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of turning pro&s;ti|tute for bread, and judge of the enormity of his guilt by the evils which it produces.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted but that numbers follow this dreadful cour&s;e of life, with &s;hame, horror, and regret; but, where can they hope
<PB N="62" REF="63">
for refuge? "<HI>The world is not their friend, nor the world's law.</HI>" Their &s;ighs, and tears, and groans, are criminal in the eye of their tyrants, the bully and the bawd, who fatten on their mi&s;ery, and threaten them with want or a gaol, if they &s;hew the lea&s;t de&s;ign of e&s;caping from their bondage.</P>
<P>"TO wipe all tears from off all faces," is a ta&s;k too hard for mortals; but to alleviate misfortunes is often within the mo&s;t limited power: yet the opportunities which every day affords of relieving the mo&s;t wretched of human beings are overlooked and neglected, with equal di&s;regard of policy and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE are places, indeed, &s;et apart, to which the&s;e unhappy creatures may re&s;ort, when the di&s;ea&s;es of incontinence &s;eize upon them; but, if they obtain a cure, to what are they reduced? Either to return with the &s;mall remains of beauty to their former guilt, or peri&s;h in the &s;treets with nakedne&s;s and hun|ger.</P>
<P>HOW frequently have the gay and thought|le&s;s, in their evening frolicks, &s;een a band of the&s;e mi&s;erable females, covered with rags,

<P>AN ancient poet, unrea&s;onably di&s;content|ed at the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, which his &s;y&s;tem of opinions obliged him to repre|&s;ent in its wor&s;t form, has ob&s;erved of the earth, "that its greater part is covered by the uninhabitable ocean; that of the re&s;t &s;ome is encumbered with naked mountains, and &s;ome lo&s;t under barren &s;ands; &s;ome &s;corch|ed with unintermitted heat, and &s;ome pe|trified with perpetual fro&s;t; &s;o that only a few regions remain for the production of fruits, the pa&s;ture of cattle, and the ac|commodation of man."</P>
<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be transferred to the time allotted us in our pre&s;ent &s;tate. When we have deducted all that is ab&s;orbed in &s;leep, all that is inevitably appropriated to the demands of nature, or irre&s;i&s;tibly engro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="65" REF="66">
by the tyranny of cu&s;tom; all that pa&s;&s;es in regulating the &s;uperficial decorations of life, or is given up in the reciprocations of civility to the di&s;po&s;al of others; all that is torn from us by violence of di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;tolen impercep|tibly away by la&s;&s;itude and languor; we &s;hall find that part of our duration very &s;mall of which we can truly call our&s;elves ma&s;ters, or which we can &s;pend wholly at our own choice. Many of our hours are lo&s;t in a rotation of petty cares, in a con&s;tant recurrence of the &s;ame employments; many of our provi&s;ions for ea&s;e or happine&s;s are always exhau&s;ted by the pre&s;ent day; and a great part of our exi|&s;tence &s;erves no other purpo&s;e, than that of enabling us to enjoy the re&s;t.</P>
<P>OF the few moments which are left in our di&s;po&s;al, it may rea&s;onably be expected, that we &s;hould be &s;o frugal, as to let none of them &s;lip from us without &s;ome equivalent; and perhaps it might be found, that as the earth, however &s;treightened by rocks or waters, is capable of producing more than all its inha|bitants are able to con&s;ume, our lives, though much contracted by incidental di&s;traction, and inevitable avocations, would yet afford us a
<PB N="66" REF="67">
large &s;pace vacant to the exerci&s;e of our rea|&s;on and our virtue; that we want not time, but diligence, for great performances; and that we &s;quander much of our allowance, even think it &s;paring and in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>THIS natural and nece&s;&s;ary comminution of our lives, perhaps, often makes us in&s;en|&s;ible of the negligence with which we &s;uffer them to &s;lide away; we never con&s;ider our|&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once of time &s;ufficient for any great de&s;ign, and therefore indulge our&s;elves in fortuitous amu&s;ements. We think it unnece&s;&s;ary to take an account of a few &s;upernumerary moments, which, however employed, could have produced little advan|tage, and which were expo&s;ed to a thou&s;and chances of di&s;turbance and interruption.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that either by nature or by habit, our under&s;tandings are fitted to images of a certain extent, to which we adju&s;t great things by divi&s;ion, and little things by accumulation. Of exten&s;ive &s;urfaces we can only take a &s;urvey, as the parts &s;ucceed one another; and atoms we cannot perceive, till they are united into ma&s;&s;es. Thus we break
<PB N="67" REF="68">
the va&s;t periods of time into centuries and years; and thus, if we would know the amount of moments, we mu&s;t agglomerate them into days and weeks.</P>
<P>THE proverbial oracles of our par&s;imonious ance&s;tors have informed us, that the fatal wa&s;te of fortune is by &s;mall expences, by the profu|&s;ion of &s;ums too little &s;ingly to alarm our caution, and which we never &s;uffer our&s;elves to con&s;ider together. Of the &s;ame kind is the prodigality of life; he that hopes to look back hereafter with &s;atisfaction upon pa&s;t years, mu&s;t learn to know the pre&s;ent value of &s;ingle minutes, and endeavour to let no particle of time fall u&s;ele&s;s to the ground.</P>
<P>IT is u&s;ual for tho&s;e who are advi&s;ed to the per&s;uit of any &s;tudy, or the attainment of any new qualification, to look upon them&s;elves as required to change the general cour&s;e of their conduct, to di&s;mi&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s, and ex|clude plea&s;ure, and to devote their days and nights to a particular attention. But all common degrees of excellence are attainable at a lower price; he that &s;hould &s;teadily and re&s;olutely a&s;&s;ign to any &s;cience or language
<PB N="68" REF="69">
tho&s;e inter&s;titial vacancies which intervene in the mo&s;t crouded variety of diver&s;ion or em|ployment, would find every day new irradia|tions of knowledge, and di&s;cover how much more is to be hoped from frequency and per&s;everance than from violent efforts, and &s;udden de&s;ires; efforts which are &s;oon remitted when they encounter difficulty, and de&s;ires which, if they are indulged too often will &s;hake off the authority of rea|&s;on, and range capriciou&s;ly from one object to another.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition to defer every important de&s;ign to a time of lei&s;ure, and a &s;tate of &s;et|tled uniformity, proceeds generally from a fal&s;e e&s;timate of the human powers. If we except tho&s;e gigantick and &s;tupendous intelli|gences who are &s;aid to gra&s;p a &s;y&s;tem by intui|tion, and bound forward from one &s;eries of conclu&s;ions to another, without regular &s;teps through intermediate propo&s;itions, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tudents make their advances in knowledge by &s;hort flights, between each of which the mind may lie at re&s;t. For every &s;ingle act of progre&s;&s;ion a &s;hort time is &s;uffi|cient;
<PB N="69" REF="70">
and it is only nece&s;&s;ary, that whenever that time is afforded, it be well employed.</P>
<P>FEW minds will be long confined to &s;e|vere and laborious meditation; and when a &s;ucce&s;sful attack on knowledge has been made, the &s;tudent recreates him&s;elf with the contem|plation of his conque&s;t, and forbears another incur&s;ion, till the new-acquired truth has be|come familiar, and his curio&s;ity calls upon him for fre&s;h gratifications. Whether the time of intermi&s;&s;ion is &s;pent in company, or in &s;olitude, in nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, or in volun|tary levities, the under&s;tanding is equally ab&s;|tracted from the object of enquiry; but, per|haps, if it be detained by occupations le&s;s plea&s;ing, it returns again to &s;tudy with greater alacrity, than when it is glutted with ideal plea&s;ures, and &s;urfeited with intemperance of application. He that will not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be di&s;couraged by fancied impo&s;&s;ibilities, may &s;ometimes find his abilities invigorated by the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting them in &s;hort inter|vals, as the force of a current is encrea&s;ed by the contraction of its chanel.</P>
<P>FROM &s;ome cau&s;e like this, it has probably
<PB N="70" REF="71">
proceeded, that among tho&s;e who have con|tributed to the advancement of learning, many have ri&s;en to eminence in oppo&s;ition to all the ob&s;tacles, which external circum|&s;tances could place in their way, amid&s;t the tumult of bu&s;ine&s;s, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poverty, or the di&s;&s;ipations of a wandering and un|&s;ettled &s;tate. A great part of the life of <HI>Era&s;|mus</HI> was one continual peregrination; ill &s;up|plied with the gifts of fortune, and led from city to city, and from kingdom to kingdom, by the hopes of patrons and preferment, hopes which always flattered and always deceived him; he yet found means by un&s;haken con|&s;tancy, and a vigilant improvement of tho&s;e hours, which, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s activity, will remain unengaged, to write more than another in the &s;ame condition would have hoped to read. Compelled by want to attendance and &s;olicitation, and &s;o much ver&s;ed in common life, that he has tran&s;mitted to us the mo&s;t perfect delineation of the manners of his age, he joined to his knowledge of the world, &s;uch application to books, that he will &s;tand for ever in the fir&s;t rank of literary heroes. How this proficiency was obtained he &s;ufficiently di&s;covers, by in|forming

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH you &s;eem to have taken a view &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive of the mi|&s;eries of life, and have employed much of your &s;peculation on mournful &s;ubjects, you have not yet exhau&s;ted the whole &s;tock of hu|man infelicity. There is &s;till a &s;pecies of wretchedne&s;s which e&s;capes your ob&s;ervation, though it might &s;upply you with many &s;age remarks, and &s;alutary cautions.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but imagine the &s;tart of atten|tion awakened by this welcome hint; and at this in&s;tant &s;ee the rambler &s;nuffing his candle, rubbing his &s;pectacles, &s;tirring his fire, lock|ing
<PB N="73" REF="74">
out interruption, and &s;ettling him&s;elf in his ea&s;y chair, that he may enjoy a new ca|lamity without di&s;turbance. For, whether it be, that continued &s;ickne&s;s or misfortune has acquainted you only with the bitterne&s;s of be|ing; or that you imagine none but your&s;elf able to di&s;cover what I &s;uppo&s;e has been &s;een and felt by all the inhabitants of the world: whether you intend your writings as antidotal to the levity and merriment with which your rivals endeavour to attract the favour of the publick; or fancy that you have &s;ome parti|cular powers of dolorous declamation, and <HI>warble out your groans</HI> with uncommon ele|gance or energy; it is certain, that, what|ever be your &s;ubject, melancholy for the mo&s;t part bur&s;ts in upon your &s;peculation, your gaiety is quickly overca&s;t, and though your readers may be flattered with hopes of plea&s;an|try, they are &s;eldom di&s;mi&s;&s;ed but with heavy hearts.</P>
<P>THAT I may therefore gratify you with an imitation of your own &s;yllables of &s;adne&s;s, I will inform you that I was condemned by &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous influence to be an only &s;on, born to the apparent pro&s;pect of a large for|tune,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and allotted to my parents at that time of life when &s;atiety of common diver&s;ions al|lows the mind to indulge parental affection with greater inten&s;ene&s;s. My birth was cele|brated by the tenants with fea&s;ts, and dances, and bagpipes; congratulations were &s;ent from every family within ten miles round; and my parents di&s;covered in my fir&s;t cries &s;uch tokens of future virtue and under&s;tanding, that they declared them&s;elves determined to devote the remaining part of life to my happine&s;s, and the encrea&s;e of their e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE abilities of my father and mother were not perceptibly unequal, and educa|tion had given neither much advantage over the other. They had both kept good com|pany, rattled in chariots, glittered in play|hou&s;es, and danced at court, and were both expert in the games that were in their time ge|nerally, called in as auxiliaries again&s;t the in|tru&s;ion of thought.</P>
<P>WHEN there is &s;uch a parity between two per&s;ons a&s;&s;ociated for life, the dejection which the hu&s;band, if he be not completely &s;tupid, mu&s;t always &s;uffer for want of &s;uperiority,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
&s;inks him to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s. My mamma, therefore, governed the family without con|troul; and except that my father &s;till retained &s;ome authority in the &s;tables, and now and then, after a &s;upernumerary bottle, broke a looking-gla&s;s or china di&s;h to prove his &s;ove|reignty, the whole cour&s;e of the year was re|gulated by her direction, the &s;ervants received from her all their orders, and the tenants were continued or di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at her di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>SHE therefore thought her&s;elf entitled to the &s;uperintendence of her &s;on's education; and when my father, at the in&s;tigation of the par&s;on, faintly propo&s;ed that I &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;chool, very po&s;itively told him, that &s;he would not &s;uffer &s;o fine a child to be ruined; that &s;he never knew any boys at a grammar-&s;chool that could come into a room without blu&s;hing, or &s;it at the table without &s;ome auk|ward unea&s;ine&s;s; that they were always put|ting them&s;elves into danger by boi&s;terous plays, or vitiating their behaviour with mean company; and that, for her part, &s;he would rather follow me to the grave than &s;ee me tear my cloaths, and hang down my head, and
<PB N="76" REF="77">
&s;neak about with dirty &s;hoes and blotted fin|gers, hair unpowdered, and a hat uncocked.</P>
<P>MY father, who had no other end in his propo&s;al than to appear wi&s;e and manly, &s;oon acquie&s;ced, &s;ince I was not to live by my learning; for, indeed, he had known very few &s;tudents that had not &s;ome &s;tiffne&s;s in their manner. They therefore agreed, that a do|me&s;tick tutor &s;hould be procured, and hired an hone&s;t gentleman of mean conver&s;ation and narrow &s;entiments, but whom, having pa&s;&s;ed the common forms of literary education, they implicitly concluded qualified to teach all that was to be learned from a &s;cholar. He thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently exalted by being placed at the &s;ame table with his pupil, and had no other view than to perpetuate his felicity by unlimited reverence, and the utmo&s;t flexi|bility of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all my mother's opinions and caprices. He therefore frequently took away my book, le&s;t I &s;hould mope with too much application, charged me never to write without turning up my ruffles, and generally bru&s;hed my coat before he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me into the parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
<HI>HE</HI> had, indeed, no occa&s;ion to complain of too burden&s;ome an employment; for my mother very judiciou&s;ly con&s;idered, that I was not likely to grow politer in his company, and therefore &s;uffered me not to pa&s;s any more time in his apartment than my le&s;&s;on required. When I was &s;ummoned to my ta&s;k, &s;he gene|rally enjoined me not to get any of my tutor's ways, who was &s;eldom mentioned before me but for practices to be avoided. I was every moment admoni&s;hed not to lean on my chair, cro&s;s my legs, or &s;wing my hands like my tu|tor; and once my mother very &s;eriou&s;ly deli|berated upon his total di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e I began, &s;he faid, to learn his manner of &s;ticking on my hat, and had his bend in my &s;houlders, and his totter in my gait.</P>
<P>SUCH, however, was her care, that I e&s;ca|ped all the&s;e depravities; and when I was only twelve years old, had rid my&s;elf of every ap|pearance of childi&s;h diffidence. I was cele|brated round the country for the petulance of my remarks, and the quickne&s;s of my replies; and many a &s;cholar five years older than my&s;elf have I da&s;hed into confu&s;ion by the &s;teadine&s;s
<PB N="78" REF="79">
of my countenance, &s;ilenced by my readine&s;s of repartee, and tortured with envy by the addre&s;s with which I picked up a fan, pre|&s;ented a &s;nuff-box, or received an empty tea-cup.</P>
<P>AT thirteen I was &s;o completely &s;killed in all the niceties of dre&s;s, that I could not only enumerate all the variety of &s;ilks, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h the product of a <HI>French</HI> loom, but dart my eye through a numerous company, and ob|&s;erve every deviation from the reigning mode. I was univer&s;ally &s;kilful in all the changes of expen&s;ive finery; but, as they &s;ay, every one has &s;omething to which he is particularly born, was eminently knowing in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> lace.</P>
<P>THE next year &s;aw me advanced to the tru&s;t and power of adju&s;ting the ceremonial of an a&s;&s;embly. Every one received his partner from my hand, and to me every &s;tranger ap|plied for introduction. My heart now di&s;dain|ed the in&s;tructions of a tutor, who was re|warded with a &s;mall annuity for life, and left me qualified, in my own opinion, to govern my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
IN a &s;hort time I came to <HI>London,</HI> and as my father was well known among the higher cla&s;&s;es of life, &s;oon obtained admi&s;&s;ion to the mo&s;t &s;plendid a&s;&s;emblies, and mo&s;t crouded card-tables. Here I found my&s;elf univer&s;ally care&s;&s;ed and applauded: the ladies prai&s;ed the fancy of my cloaths, the beauty of my form, and the &s;oftne&s;s of my voice; endeavoured in every place to force them&s;elves upon my no|tice; and invited by a thou&s;and oblique &s;olici|tations my attendance to the play-hou&s;e, and my &s;alutations in the park. I was now happy to the utmo&s;t extent of my conception; I pa&s;&s;ed every morning in dre&s;s, every afternoon in vi&s;its, and every night in &s;ome &s;elect a&s;&s;em|blies, where neither care nor knowledge were &s;uffered to mole&s;t us.</P>
<P>AFTER a few years, however, the&s;e de|lights became familiar, and I had lei&s;ure to look round me with more attention. I then found that my flatterers had very little power to relieve the languor of &s;atiety, or recreate wearine&s;s, by varied amu&s;ement; and therefore endeavoured to enlarge the &s;phere of my plea|&s;ures, and to try what &s;atisfaction might be
<PB N="80" REF="81">
found in the &s;ociety of men. I will not deny the mortification with which I perceived, that every man, who&s;e name I had heard mention|ed with re&s;pect, received me with a kind of tenderne&s;s nearly bordering on compa&s;&s;ion; and that tho&s;e who&s;e reputation was not well e&s;tabli&s;hed, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify their under&s;tandings, by treating me with contempt. One of the&s;e witlings elevated his cre&s;t, by a&s;king me in a full coffee-hou&s;e the price of patches; and another whi&s;pered, that he won|dered why mi&s;s <HI>Fri&s;k</HI> did not keep me that afternoon to watch her &s;quirrel.</P>
<P>WHEN I found my&s;elf thus hunted from all ma&s;culine conver&s;ation by tho&s;e who were them&s;elves barely admitted, I returned to the ladies, and re&s;olved to dedicate my life to their &s;ervice and their plea&s;ure. But I find that I have now lo&s;t my charms. Of tho&s;e with whom I entered the gay world, &s;ome are married, &s;ome have retired, and &s;ome have &s;o much changed their opinion, that they &s;carcely pay any regard to my civilities, if there is any other man in the place. The new flight of beauties to whom I have made addre&s;&s;es, &s;uffer me to pay the treat, and then titter with
<PB N="81" REF="82">
boys. So that I now find my&s;elf welcome only to a few grave ladies, who, unacquainted with all that gives either u&s;e or dignity to life, are content to pa&s;s their hours between their bed and their cards, without e&s;teem from the old, or reverence from the young.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but think, Mr. RAMBLER, that I have rea&s;on to complain; for &s;urely the females ought to pay &s;ome regard to the age of him who&s;e youth was pa&s;&s;ed in endeavours to plea&s;e them. They that encourage folly in the boy have no right to puni&s;h it in the man. Yet I find, that though they lavi&s;h their fir&s;t fondne&s;s upon pertne&s;s and gaiety, they &s;oon transfer their regard to other qualities, and un|gratefully abandon their adorers to dream out their la&s;t years in &s;tupidity and contempt.</P>

THE various methods of propitiation and atonement which fear and folly have dictated, or artifice and intere&s;t tolerated in the differ|ent parts of the world, however they may &s;ometimes reproach or degrade humanity, at lea&s;t &s;hew the general con&s;ent of all ages and nations in their opinion of the mercy and pla|cability of the divine nature.

There could be no pro&s;pect of enjoying the protection or regard of him, whom the lea&s;t deviation from recti|tude made inexorable for ever; and every man would naturally withdraw his thoughts from the contemplation of a Creator, whom he mu&s;t con&s;ider as a governor too pure to be plea&s;ed, and too &s;evere to be pacified; as an enemy infinitely wi&s;e, and infinitely powerful, whom he could neither deceive, e&s;cape, nor re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>WHERE there is no hope, there can be no
<PB N="84" REF="85">
endeavour. A con&s;tant and unfailing obedi|ence is above the reach of terre&s;trial diligence; and therefore the progre&s;s of life could only have been the natural de&s;cent of negligent de|&s;pair from crime to crime, had not the univer|&s;al per&s;ua&s;ion of forgivene&s;s to be obtained by proper means of reconciliation recalled tho&s;e to the paths of virtue whom their pa&s;&s;ions had &s;olicited a&s;ide; and animated to new attempts, and firmer per&s;everance, tho&s;e whom difficulty had di&s;couraged, or negligence &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN ages and regions &s;o disjoined from each other, that there can &s;carcely be imagined any communication of &s;entiments either by com|merce or tradition, has prevailed a general and uniform expectation of propitiating God by corporal au&s;terities, of anticipating his ven|geance by voluntary inflictions, and appea&s;|ing his ju&s;tice by a &s;peedy and chearful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to a le&s;s penalty when a greater is in|curred.</P>
<P>INCORPORATED minds will always feel &s;ome inclination towards exterior acts, and ri|tual ob&s;ervances. Ideas not repre&s;ented by &s;en&s;ible objects are fleeting, variable, and eva|ne&s;cent.
<PB N="85" REF="86">
We are not able to judge of the de|gree of conviction which operated at any par|ticular time upon our own thoughts, but as it is recorded by &s;ome certain and definite effect. He that reviews his life in order to determine the probability of his acceptance with God, if he could once e&s;tabli&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary propor|tion between crimes and &s;ufferings, might &s;e|curely re&s;t upon his performance of the expia|tion; but while &s;afety remains the reward only of mental purity, he is always afraid le&s;t he &s;hould decide too &s;oon in his own favour; le&s;t he &s;hould not have felt the pangs of true contrition; le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;take &s;atiety for abhorrence, or imagine that his pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubdued when they are only &s;leeping.</P>
<P>FROM this natural and rea&s;onable diffidence aro&s;e, in humble and timorous piety, a di&s;po|&s;ition to confound penance with repentance, to repo&s;e on human determinations, and to receive from &s;ome judicial &s;entence the &s;tated and regular a&s;&s;ignment of reconciliatory pain. We are never willing to be without re&s;ource; we &s;eek in the knowledge of others a &s;uccour for our own ignorance, and are ready to tru&s;t
<PB N="86" REF="87">
any that will undertake to direct us when we have no confidence in our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;ire to a&s;certain by &s;ome outward marks the &s;tate of the &s;oul, and this willing|ne&s;s to calm the con&s;cience by &s;ome &s;ettled method, have produced, as they are diver&s;i|fied in their effects by various tempers and principles, mo&s;t of the di&s;qui&s;itions and rules, the doubts and &s;olutions, that have embarra&s;&s;ed the doctrine of repentance, and perplexed ten|der and flexible minds with innumerable &s;cru|ples concerning the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures of &s;or|row, and adequate degrees of &s;elf-abhorrence; and the&s;e rules corrupted by fraud, or deba&s;ed by credulity, have, by the common re&s;iliency of the mind from one extreme to another, in|cited others to an open contempt of all &s;ub&s;i|diary ordinances, all prudential caution, and the whole di&s;cipline of regulated piety.</P>
<P>REPENTANCE, however difficult to be practi&s;ed, is, if it be explained without &s;uper|&s;tition, ea&s;ily under&s;tood. <HI>Repentance is the relinqui&s;hment of any practice from the conviction that it has offended God.</HI> Sorrow, and fear, and anxiety, are properly not parts, but ad|juncts
<PB N="87" REF="88">
of repentance; yet they are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with it, that they cannot ea&s;ily be &s;eparated; for they not only mark its &s;ince|rity but promote its efficacy.</P>
<P>NO man commits any act of negligence or ob&s;tinacy, by which his pre&s;ent &s;afety or hap|pine&s;s is endangered, without feeling the pun|gency of remor&s;e. He who is fully convinced, that he &s;uffers by his own failure, can never for|bear to trace back his mi&s;carriage to its fir&s;t cau&s;e, to image to him&s;elf a contrary beha|viour, and to form involuntary re&s;olutions again&s;t the like fault, even when he knows that he &s;hall never again have the power of committing it. No man finds him&s;elf in dan|ger without &s;uch trepidations of impatience as leave all human means of &s;afety behind them: he that has once caught an alarm of terror, is every moment &s;eized with u&s;ele&s;s anxieties, always adding one &s;ecurity to another, trem|bling with &s;udden doubts, and di&s;tracted by the perpetual occurrence of new expedients. If, therefore, he who&s;e crimes have deprived him of the favour of God, can reflect upon his conduct without di&s;turbance, or can at will bani&s;h the reflection; if he who con&s;iders
<PB N="88" REF="89">
him&s;elf as &s;u&s;pended over the aby&s;s of eternal perdition only by the thread of life, which mu&s;t &s;oon part by its own weakne&s;s, and which the wing of every minute may divide, can ca&s;t his eyes round him without &s;huddering with horror, or panting for &s;ecurity; what can he judge of him&s;elf but that he is not yet awaked to &s;ufficient conviction, &s;ince every lo&s;s is more lamented than the lo&s;s of the divine fa|vour, and every danger more dreaded than the danger of final condemnation?</P>
<P>RETIREMENT from the cares and plea|&s;ures of the world has been often recom|mended as u&s;eful to repentance. This at lea&s;t is evident, that every one retires, whenever ratiocination and recollection are required on other occa&s;ions: and &s;urely the retro&s;pect of life, the di&s;entanglement of actions compli|cated with innumerable circum&s;tances, and diffu&s;ed in various relations, the di&s;covery of the primary movements of the heart, and the extirpation of lu&s;ts and appetites deeply rooted, and widely &s;pread, may be allowed to de|mand &s;ome &s;ece&s;&s;ion from &s;port and noi&s;e, and bu&s;ine&s;s and folly. Some &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of com|mon affairs, &s;ome pau&s;e of temporal pain and
<PB N="89" REF="90">
plea&s;ure, is doubtle&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to him that de|liberates for eternity, who is forming the only plan in which mi&s;carriage cannot be re|paired, and examining the only que&s;tion in which mi&s;take cannot be rectified.</P>
<P>AUSTERITIES and mortifications are means by which the mind is invigorated and rou&s;ed, by which the attractions of plea|&s;ure are interrupted, and the chains of &s;en&s;ua|lity are broken. It is ob&s;erved by one of the fathers, that <HI>he who re&s;trains him&s;elf in the u&s;e of things lawful, will never encroach upon things forbidden.</HI> Ab&s;tinence, if nothing more, is, at lea&s;t, a cautious retreat from the utmo&s;t verge of permi&s;&s;ion, and confers that &s;ecurity which cannot be rea&s;onably hoped by him that dares always to hover over the precipice of de&s;truction, or delights to approach the plea|&s;ures which he knows it fatal to partake. Au&s;terity is the proper antidote to indulgence; the di&s;ea&s;es of mind as well as body are cured by contraries, and to contraries we &s;hould readily have recour&s;e, if we dreaded guilt as we dread pain.</P>
<P>THE completion and &s;um of repentance is
<PB N="90" REF="91">
a change of life. That &s;orrow which dictates no caution, that fear which does not quicken our e&s;cape, that au&s;terity which fails to rectily our affections, are vain and unavailing. But &s;orrow and terror mu&s;t naturally precede reformation; for what other cau&s;e can pro|duce it? He, therefore, that feels him&s;elf al|armed by his con&s;cience, anxious for the at|tainment of a better &s;tate, and afflicted by the memory of his pa&s;t faults, may ju&s;tly conclude, that the great work of repentance is begun, and hope by retirement and prayer, the natu|ral and religious means of &s;trengthening his conviction, to impre&s;s upon his mind &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, as may over|power the blandi&s;hments of &s;ecular delights, and enable him to advance from one degree of holine&s;s to another, till death &s;hall &s;et him free from mi&s;ery and temptation. <Q><L>What better can we do, than pro&s;trate fall</L>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, by long experience, that late &s;prings produce the greate&s;t plenty. The delay of blooms and fragrance, of verdure and breezes, is for the mo&s;t part liberally recompen&s;ed by the exuberance and fecundity of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;ons; the blo&s;|&s;oms which lie concealed till the year is ad|vanced, and the &s;un is high, e&s;cape tho&s;e chilling bla&s;ts, and nocturnal fro&s;ts, which are often fatal to early luxuriance, prey upon the fir&s;t &s;miles of vernal beauty, de&s;troy the feeble principles of vegetable life, intercept the fruit in the gem, and beat down the flow|ers unopened to the ground.</P>

I AM afraid there is little hope of per&s;ua|ding the young and &s;prightly part of my rea|ders, upon whom the &s;pring naturally forces my attention, to learn from the great proce&s;s of nature, the difference between diligence and hurry, between &s;peed and precipitation; to pro&s;ecute their de&s;igns with calmne&s;s, to watch the concurrence of opportunity, and endeavour to find the lucky moment which they cannot make. Youth is the time of enterprize and hope; having yet had no occa|&s;ion of comparing our force with any oppo|&s;ing power, we naturally form pre&s;umptions in our own favour, and imagine that ob&s;tru|ction and impediment will give way before us. The fir&s;t repul&s;es rather inflame vehe|mence than teach prudence; a brave and ge|nerous mind is long before it &s;u&s;pects its own weakne&s;s, or &s;ubmits to &s;ap the difficulties which it purpo&s;ed to &s;ubdue by &s;torm, and expected to overbear in the violence of its cour&s;e. Before di&s;appointments have enfor|ced the dictates of philo&s;ophy, we believe it in our power to &s;horten the interval between the fir&s;t cau&s;e and the la&s;t effect; we laugh at the timorous delays of plodding indu&s;try, and
<PB N="93" REF="94">
fancy that by encrea&s;ing the fire, we can at plea&s;ure accelerate the projection.</P>
<P>AT our entrance into the world, when health and vigour give us fair promi&s;es of time &s;ufficient for the regular maturation of all our &s;chemes, and a long enjoyment of all our ac|qui&s;itions, we are eager to &s;eize the pre&s;ent moment, to pluck every gratification within our reach without &s;uffering it to ripen into perfection, and to croud all the varieties of delight into a narrow compa&s;s: but age &s;el|dom fails to change our conduct; we grow commonly negligent of time in proportion as we have le&s;s remaining, and &s;uffer the la&s;t part of life to &s;teal from us in languid prepa|rations for &s;ome future undertaking, or in &s;low approaches to &s;ome remote advantage, in weak hopes of &s;ome fortuitous occurrence, or in drow&s;y equilibrations of undetermined coun&s;el. Whether it be that the aged, hav|ing ta&s;ted the plea&s;ures of man's condition, and found them fal&s;e and delu&s;ive, become le&s;s anxious for their attainment; or that frequent mi&s;carriages have depre&s;&s;ed them to de&s;pair, and frozen them to inactivity; or that, like all other objects of terror, death &s;hocks them
<PB N="94" REF="95">
more as it advances upon them, and they are afraid of reminding them&s;elves of their decay, or to di&s;cover to their own hearts, that the time of trifling is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>A PERPETUAL conflict with our natural de&s;ires &s;eems to be the lot of our pre&s;ent &s;tate. In youth we require &s;omething of the tardi|ne&s;s and frigidity of age; and in age, we mu&s;t labour to recal the fire and impetuo&s;ity of youth; in youth we mu&s;t learn to expect, and in age to enjoy.</P>
<P>THE torment of expectation is, indeed, not ea&s;ily to be born at a time when every idea of gratification fires the blood, and fla&s;hes on the fancy; when the heart is va|cant to every fre&s;h form of delight, and has no rival engagements to withdraw it from the importunities of a new de&s;ire. Yet &s;ince the fear of mi&s;&s;ing what we &s;eek mu&s;t always be proportionable to the advantage that we ex|pect from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, the pa&s;&s;ions, even in this tempe&s;tuous &s;tate, might be &s;omewhat moderated and re&s;trained by frequent inculca|tion of the mi&s;chief of temerity, and the ha|zard
<PB N="95" REF="96">
of lo&s;ing that which we endeavour to &s;eize before our time.</P>
<P>HE that too early a&s;pires to honours, mu&s;t re&s;olve to encounter not only the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, but the malignity of envy. He that is too eager to be rich, generally endangers his fortune in wild adventures, and uncertain projects; and he that ha&s;tens too &s;peedily to reputation, often endeavours to &s;upport his character by artifices and fallacies, decks him|&s;elf in colours which quickly fade, or in plumes which accident may &s;hake off, or competi|tion pluck away.</P>
<P>THE uncertainty and danger of early emi|nence has been extended by &s;ome, even to the gifts of nature; and an opinion has been long conceived, that quickne&s;s of invention, accuracy of judgment, or extent of know|ledge, appearing in an uncommon degree be|fore the u&s;ual time, pre&s;age a &s;hort life. Even tho&s;e who are le&s;s inclined to form general conclu&s;ions, from in&s;tances which by their own nature mu&s;t be rare, have yet been in|clined to progno&s;ticate no &s;uitable progre&s;s from the fir&s;t &s;allies of rapid wits; but have
<PB N="96" REF="97">
ob&s;erved, that after a &s;hort effort they either loiter or faint, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the equal and regular per&s;eve|rance of &s;lower under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>IT, indeed, frequently happens, that ap|plau&s;e abates diligence. He that finds him|&s;elf to have performed more than was demand|ed, is contented to &s;pare the labour of unne|ce&s;&s;ary performances, and &s;its down to enjoy at ea&s;e his &s;uper&s;luities of honour. He whom &s;ucce&s;s has made confident of his abilities, ea&s;i|ly allows him&s;elf the privilege of negligence, and looks contemptuou&s;ly on the gradual ad|vances of a rival, whom he imagines him&s;elf able to leave behind him whenever he &s;hall again &s;ummon his force to the conte&s;t. But long intervals of plea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipate attention, and weaken con&s;tancy; nor is it ea&s;y for him that has &s;unk from diligence into &s;loth to rou&s;e out of his lethargy, to recollect his notions, rekindle his curio&s;ity, and engage with his former ardour in the toils of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>EVEN that friend&s;hip which intends the re|ward of genius, too often tends to ob&s;truct it. The plea&s;ure of being care&s;&s;ed, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
<PB N="97" REF="98">
and admired, ea&s;ily &s;educes the &s;tu|dent from literary &s;olitude. He is ready to follow the call which &s;ummons him tohear his own prai&s;e, and which, perhaps, at once flatters appetites with certainty of plea&s;ures, and his ambition with hopes of patronage; plea&s;ures which he conceives inexhau&s;tible, and hopes which he has not yet learned to di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE evils, indeed, are by no means to be imputed to nature, or to be con&s;idered as in&s;eparable from an early di&s;play of uncom|mon abilities. They may be certainly e&s;caped by prudence and re&s;olution, and mu&s;t therefore be recounted rather as con&s;olations to tho&s;e who are le&s;s liberally endowed, than as di&s;couragements to &s;uch as are born with uncommon qualities. Beauty is well known to draw after it the per&s;ecutions of imperti|nence, to incite the artifices of envy, and to rai&s;e the flames of unlawful love; yet among the ladies whom prudence or mode&s;ty have made mo&s;t eminent, who has ever complained of the inconveniencies or the dangers of an amiable form? or who would have purcha&s;ed &s;afety by the lo&s;s of beauty?</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">
NEITHER grace of per&s;on, nor vigour of under&s;tanding, are to be regarded otherwi&s;e than as ble&s;&s;ings, as means of happine&s;s in|dulged by the Supreme Benefactor; but the advantages of either may be lo&s;t by too much eagerne&s;s to obtain them. A thou&s;and beau|ties in their fir&s;t blo&s;&s;om, by an imprudent expo&s;ure to the open world, have &s;uddenly withered at the bla&s;t of infamy; and men who might have &s;ubjected new regions to the em|pire of learning have been lured by the prai&s;e of their fir&s;t productions from academical re|tirement, and wa&s;ted their days in vice and dependence. The virgin who too &s;oon a&s;pires to celebrity and conque&s;t, peri&s;hes by childi&s;h vanity, ignorant credulity, or guiltle&s;s indi&s;|cretion. The genius who catches at laurels and preferment before his time, mocks the hopes that he had excited, and lo&s;es tho&s;e years which might have been mo&s;t u&s;efully employed, the years of youth, of &s;pirit, and vivacity.</P>
<P>IT is one of the innumerable ab&s;urdities of pride, that we are never more impatient of direction, than in that part of li&s;e when we

need it mo&s;t; we are in ha&s;te to meet ene|mies whom we have not &s;trength to over|come, and to undertake ta&s;ks which we can|not perform: and as he that once mi&s;carries, does not ea&s;ily per&s;uade mankind to favour or ob&s;erve another attempt, an ineffectual &s;truggle for fame is often followed by perpe|tual ob&s;curity.</P>

<P>WE are taught by <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> that health is be&s;t pre&s;erved by avoiding &s;ettled ha|bits of life, and deviating &s;ometimes into &s;light aberrations from the &s;trict laws of medicine by varying the proportions of food and exer|ci&s;e, interrupting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of re&s;t and labour, and mingling hard&s;hips with indul|gence.

<P>THE &s;ame laxity of regimen is equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary to intellectual health, to a con&s;tant enjoyment of gaiety, and perpetual &s;u&s;cepti|bility of occa&s;ional plea&s;ure. He that by long confinement to the &s;ame company whom perhaps &s;imilitude of ta&s;te brought fir&s;t toge|ther, has been accu&s;tomed to hear only the echo of his own &s;entiments, quickly contracts his faculties, and makes a thou&s;and things offen&s;ive that are in them&s;elves indifferent; he &s;oon bars all the common avenues of de|light, and has no part in the general diver|&s;ions or gratifications of mankind.</P>
<P>IN things which are not immediately &s;ub|ject to religious or moral con&s;ideration, it is dangerous to be too long or too rigidly in the right. Sen&s;ibility may, by an ince&s;&s;ant atten|tion
<PB N="101" REF="102">
to elegance and propriety, be quickened to a tenderne&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with the condition of humanity, irritable by the &s;malle&s;t a&s;perity, and vulnerable by the gentle&s;t touch. He that plea&s;es him&s;elf too much with minute ex|actne&s;s, and &s;ubmits to endure nothing in ac|commodations attendance, or addre&s;s, be|low the utmo&s;t point of perfection, will, whenever he enters the croud of life, be ha|ra&s;&s;ed with innumerable di&s;tre&s;&s;es, from which tho&s;e who have not in the &s;ame manner en|crea&s;ed their &s;en&s;ations find no di&s;turbance. His exotick &s;oftne&s;s will &s;hrink at the coar&s;e|ne&s;s of vulgar felicity, like a plant tran&s;|planted to northern nur&s;eries, from the dews and &s;un&s;hine of the tropical regions.</P>
<P>THERE will always be a wide interval be|tween practical and ideal excellence; and he, therefore, that allows not him&s;elf to be &s;atisfi|ed while he can perceive any error or defect, mu&s;t refer his hopes of ea&s;e to &s;ome other pe|riod of exi&s;tence. It is well known, that, ex|po&s;ed to a micro&s;cope, the &s;moothe&s;t poli&s;h of the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies di&s;covers cavities and prominences; and that the &s;ofte&s;t bloom of ro&s;eate virginity repels the eye with excre&s;|cences

and di&s;colorations. The perceptions as well as the &s;en&s;es may be improved to our own di&s;quiet, and we may, by diligent culti|vation of the powers of di&s;like, rai&s;e in time an artificial fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s, which &s;hall fill the imagination with phantoms of turpitude, &s;hew us the naked &s;keleton of every delight, and pre&s;ent us only with the pains of plea&s;ure, and the deformities of beauty.</P>
<P>PEEVISHNESS, indeed, would perhaps very little di&s;turb the peace of mankind, were it always the con&s;equence of &s;uperfluous de|licacy; for it is the privilege only of deep re|flection, or lively fancy, to de&s;troy happine&s;s by art and refinement. But by a continual indulgence of a particular humour, or by a long enjoyment of undi&s;puted &s;uperiority, the dull and thoughtle&s;s may likewi&s;e acquire the power of tormenting them&s;elves and others, and become &s;ufficiently ridiculous or hateful, to tho&s;e who are within &s;ight of their con|duct, or reach of their influence.</P>
<P>THEY that have grown old in a &s;ingle &s;tate are generally found to be moro&s;e, fretful, and captious; tenacious of their own practices and

Such is the effect of having lived without the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;ulting any inclination but their own.</P>
<P>THE ira&s;cibility of this cla&s;s of tyrants is generally exerted upon petty provocations, &s;uch as are incident to under&s;tandings not far extended beyond the in&s;tincts of animal life; but unhappily he that fixes his attention on things always before him, will never have long ce&s;&s;ations of anger.

In every other &s;tate of inferiority the certainty of plea&s;ing is perpetually increa&s;ed by a fuller knowledge of our duty; and kind|ne&s;s and confidence are &s;trengthened by every new act of tru&s;t, and proof of fidelity.

<P>CHRYSALUS gained a fortune by trade, and retired into the country; and, having a brother burdened by the number of his chil|dren, adopted one of his &s;ons. The boy was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with many prudent admonitions; in|formed of his father's inability to maintain him in his native rank; cautioned again&s;t all oppo|&s;ition to the opinions or precepts of his uncle; and animated to per&s;everance by the hopes of &s;upporting the honour of the family, and over|topping his elder brother.

But unhappily, a month after|wards, retiring at night from his uncle's chamber, he left the door open behind him: the old man tore his will, and being then pre|ceptibly delining, for want of time to delibe|rate, left his money to a trading company.</P>
<P>WHEN female minds are imbittered by age or &s;olitude, their malignity is generally exerted in a rigorous and &s;piteful &s;uperin|tendence of dome&s;tic trifles. <HI>Eriphile</HI> has employed her eloquence for twenty years up|on the degeneracy of &s;ervants, the na&s;tine&s;s of her hou&s;e, the ruin of her furniture, the diffi|culty of pre&s;erving tape&s;try from the moths, and the carele&s;ne&s;s of the &s;luts whom &s;he em|ploys in bru&s;hing it.

<P>I Know not whether it is always a proof of innocence to treat cen&s;ure with con|tempt. We owe &s;o much reverence to the wi&s;dom of mankind, as ju&s;tly to wi&s;h, that our own opinion of our merit may be ratified by the concurrence of other &s;uffrages; and &s;ince guilt and infamy mu&s;t have the &s;ame ef|fect

upon intelligences unable to pierce be|yond external appearance, and influenced often rather by example than precept, we are obliged to refute a fal&s;e charge, le&s;t we &s;hould countenance the crime which we have never committed. To turn away from an accu&s;a|tion with &s;upercilious &s;ilence, is equally in the power of him that is hardened by villiany, and in&s;pirited by innocence. The wall of bra&s;s which <HI>Horace</HI> erects upon a clear con&s;cience, may be &s;ometimes rai&s;ed by impudence or power; and we &s;hould always wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve the dignity of virtue by adorning her with graces which wickedne&s;s cannot a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on I have determined no longer to endure, with either patient or &s;ullen re&s;ignation, a reproach, which is, at lea&s;t in my opinion, unju&s;t; but will lay my ca&s;e hone&s;tly before you, that you or your readers may at length decide it.</P>
<P>WHETHER you will be able to pre&s;erve your boa&s;ted impartiality, when you hear, that I am con&s;idered as an adver&s;ary by half the &s;emale world, you may &s;urely pardon me for doubting, notwith&s;tanding the veneration to which you may imagine your&s;elf en|titled

by your age, your learning, your ab&s;|traction, or your virtue. Beauty, Mr. RAM|BLER, has often overpowered the re&s;olutions of the firm, and the rea&s;onings of the wi&s;e, rou&s;ed the old to &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;ubdued the rigorous to &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>I AM one of tho&s;e unhappy beings, who have been marked out as hu&s;bands for many different women, and deliberated a hundred times on the brink of matrimony. I have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed all the nuptial preliminaries &s;o often, that I can repeat the forms in which join|tures are &s;ettled, pin-money &s;ecured, and pro|vi&s;ions for younger children a&s;certained; but am at la&s;t doomed by general con&s;ent to ever|la&s;ting &s;olitude, and excluded by an irrever&s;ible decree from all hopes of connubial felicity. I am pointed out by every mother, as a man who&s;e vi&s;its cannot be admitted without re|proach; who rai&s;es hopes only to embitter di&s;|appointment, and makes offers only to &s;educe girls into a wa&s;te of that part of life, in which they might gain advantageous matches, and become mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and mothers.</P>
<P>I HOPE you will think, that &s;ome part of this penal &s;everity may ju&s;tly be remitted,

when I inform you, that I never yet profe&s;&s;ed love to a woman without &s;incere intentions of marriage; that I have never continued an ap|pearance of intimacy from the hour that my inclination changed, but to pre&s;erve her whom I was leaving from the &s;hock of abruptne&s;s, or the ignominy of contempt; that I always en|deavoured to give the ladies an opportunity of &s;eeming to di&s;card me; and that I never for|&s;ook a mi&s;tre&s;s for larger fortune, or brighter beauty, but becau&s;e I di&s;covered &s;ome irre|gularity in her conduct, or &s;ome depravity in her mind; not becau&s;e I was charmed by an|other, but becau&s;e I was offended by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I WAS very early tired of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of amu&s;ements by which the thoughts of mo&s;t young men are di&s;&s;ipated and enfeebled, and had not long glittered in the &s;plendour of an ample patrimony before I wi&s;hed for the calm and &s;erenity of dome&s;tick happine&s;s. Youth is naturally delighted with &s;prightline&s;s and ardour, and therefore I breathed out the &s;ighs of my fir&s;t affection at the feet of the gay, the &s;parkling, the vivacious <HI>Ferocula.</HI> I fancied to my&s;elf a perpetual &s;ource of happine&s;s in wit never exhau&s;ted, and &s;pirit never depre&s;&s;|ed;
<PB N="112" REF="113">
looked with veneration on her readine&s;s of expedients, contempt of difficulty, a&s;&s;u|rance of addre&s;s, and promptitude of reply; con&s;idered her as exempt by &s;ome prerogative of nature from the weakne&s;s and timidity of female minds; and congratulated my&s;elf upon a companion &s;uperior to all common troubles and embarra&s;&s;ments. I was, indeed, &s;ome|what di&s;turbed by the un&s;haken per&s;ever|ance with which &s;he enforced her demands of an unrea&s;onable &s;ettlement; but &s;hould have con&s;ented to pa&s;s my life in her arms, had not my curio&s;ity led me to a croud gathered in the &s;treet, where I found <HI>Ferocula,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of hundreds, di&s;puting for &s;ix-pence with a chairman. I &s;aw her in &s;o little need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that it was no breach of the laws of chivalry to forbear interpo&s;ition, and I &s;pared my&s;elf therefore the &s;hame of owning her acquaintance. I forgot &s;ome point of ceremony at our next interview, and &s;oon provoked her to forbid me her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>MY next attempt was upon a lady of great eminence for learning and philo&s;ophy. I had frequently ob&s;erved the barrenne&s;s and uni|formity of connubial conver&s;ation, and there|fore
<PB N="113" REF="114">
thought highly of my own prudence and di&s;cernment when I &s;elected from a multitude of wealthy beauties, the deep-read <HI>Mi&s;othea,</HI> who declared her&s;elf the inexorable enemy of ignorant pertne&s;s, and puerile levity; and &s;carcely conde&s;cended to make tea, but for the lingui&s;t, the geometrician, the a&s;tronomer, or the poet. The queen of the <HI>Amazons</HI> was only to be gained by the hero who could con|quer her in &s;ingle combat; and <HI>Mi&s;othea</HI>'s heart was only to ble&s;s the &s;cholar who could overpower her by di&s;putation. Amid&s;t the fonde&s;t tran&s;ports of court&s;hip &s;he could call for a definition of terms, and treated every argument with contempt that could not be reduced to regular &s;yllogi&s;m. You may ea&s;i|ly imagine, that I wi&s;hed this court&s;hip at an end; but when I de&s;ired her to &s;horten my torments, and fix the day of my felicity, we were led into a long conver&s;ation, in which <HI>Mi&s;othea</HI> endeavoured to demon&s;trate the fol|ly of attributing choice and &s;elf-direction to any human being. It was not difficult to di&s;cover the danger of committing my&s;elf for ever to the arms of one who might at any time mi&s;take the dictates of pa&s;&s;ion, or the calls of appetite, for the decree of fate; or
<PB N="114" REF="115">
con&s;ider cuckoldom as nece&s;&s;ary to the gene|ral &s;y&s;tem, as a link in the everla&s;ting chain of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive cau&s;es. I therefore told her, that de&s;tiny had ordained us to part; and that no|thing &s;hould have torn me from her but the talons of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I THEN &s;olicited the regard of the calm, the prudent, the oeconomical <HI>Sophronia,</HI> a lady who con&s;idered wit as dangerous, and learn|ing as &s;uperfluous; and thought that the wo|man who kept her hou&s;e clean, and her ac|counts exact, took receipts for every payment, and could find them at a &s;udden call, enqui|red nicely after the condition of the tenants, read the price of &s;tocks once a week, and purcha&s;ed every thing at the be&s;t market, could want no accompli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a wi&s;e man. She di&s;cour&s;ed with great &s;olemnity on the care and vigilance which the &s;uperintendance of a family de|mands; ob&s;erved how many were ruined by confidence in &s;ervants; and told me, that &s;he never expected hone&s;ty but from a &s;trong che&s;t, and that the be&s;t &s;torekeeper was the mi&s;tre&s;s's eye. Many &s;uch oracles of gene|ro&s;ity &s;he uttered, and made every day new
<PB N="115" REF="116">
improvements in her &s;chemes for the regula|tion of her &s;ervants, and the di&s;tribution of her time. I was convinced, that whatever I might &s;uffer from <HI>Sophronia,</HI> I &s;hould e&s;cape poverty; and we therefore proceeded to adju&s;t the &s;ettlements according to her own rule, <HI>fair and &s;oftly.</HI> But one morning her maid came to me in tears to intreat my intere&s;t for a reconciliation to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who had turn|ed her out at night for breaking &s;ix teeth in a tortoi&s;e-&s;hell comb: &s;he had attended her lady from a di&s;tant province, and having not lived long enough to &s;ave much money, was de&s;ti|tute among &s;trangers, and though of a good family, in danger of peri&s;hing in the &s;treets, or of being compelled by hunger to pro&s;titu|tion. I made no &s;cruple of promi&s;ing to re&s;tore her; but upon my fir&s;t application to <HI>Sophronia</HI> was an&s;wered with an air which called for ap|probation, that if &s;he neglected her own af|fairs, I might &s;u&s;pect her of neglecting mine; that the comb &s;tood her in three half-crowns; that no &s;ervant &s;hould wrong her twice; and that indeed, &s;he took the fir&s;t opportunity of parting with <HI>Phyllida,</HI> becau&s;e, though &s;he was hone&s;t, her con&s;titution was bad, and &s;he thought her very likely to fall &s;ick. Of our
<PB N="116" REF="117">
conference I need not tell you the effect; it furely may be forgiven me, if on this occa&s;ion I forgot the decency of common forms.</P>
<P>FROM two more ladies I was di&s;engaged by finding, that they entertained my rivals at the &s;ame time, and determined their choice by the liberality of our &s;ettlements. Another I thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified in for&s;aking, becau&s;e &s;he gave my attorney a bribe to favour her in the bargain; another, becau&s;e I could never &s;often her to tenderne&s;s, till &s;he heard that mo&s;t of my family had died young; and an|other, becau&s;e to encrea&s;e her fortune by ex|pectations, &s;he repre&s;ented her &s;i&s;ter as lan|gui&s;hing and con&s;umptive.</P>
<P>I SHALL in another letter give the remain|ing part of my hi&s;tory of court&s;hip. I pre|&s;ume that I &s;hould hitherto have injured the maje&s;ty of female virtue, had I not hoped to transfer my affection to higher merit.</P>

<P>POWER and &s;uperiority are &s;o flatter|ing and delightful, that, fraught with temptation and expo&s;ed to danger as they are, &s;carcely any virtue is &s;o cautious, or any pru|dence &s;o timorous, as to decline them. Even tho&s;e that have mo&s;t reverence for the laws of right, are plea&s;ed with &s;hewing that not fear, but choice, regulates their behaviour; and would be thought to comply, rather than obey. We love to overlook the boundaries which we do not wi&s;h to pa&s;s; and, as the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;atiri&s;t remarks, he that has no de&s;ign to take the life of another, is yet glad to have it in his hands.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ame principle, tending yet more to degeneracy and corruption, proceeds the de&s;ire of inve&s;ting lawful authority with ter|ror, and governing by force rather than per|&s;ua&s;ion. Pride is unwilling to believe the
<PB N="118" REF="119">
nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;igning any other rea&s;on than her own will; and would rather maintain the mo&s;t equitable claims by violence and penalties, than de&s;cend from the dignity of command to di&s;pute and expo&s;tulation.</P>
<P>IT may, I think, be &s;u&s;pected, that this po|litical pride has &s;ometimes found its way into legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies, and mingled with deli|berations upon property and life. A &s;light peru&s;al of the laws by which the mea&s;ures of vindictive and coercive ju&s;tice are e&s;tabli&s;hed, will di&s;cover &s;o many di&s;proportions between crimes and puni&s;hments, &s;uch capricious di&s;|tinctions of guilt, and &s;uch confu&s;ion of re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;everity, as can &s;carcely be be|lieved to have been produced by publick wi&s;|dom, &s;incerely and calmly &s;tudious of publick happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE learned, the judicious, the pious <HI>Boerhaave</HI> relates, that he never &s;aw a crimi|minal dragged to execution without a&s;king him&s;elf, "Who knows whether this man is not le&s;s culpable than me?" On the days when the pri&s;ons of this city are emptied into the grave, let every &s;pectator of the dread|ful

proce&s;&s;ion put the &s;ame que&s;tion to his own heart. How few among tho&s;e that croud in thou&s;ands to the legal ma&s;&s;acre, and look with carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, perhaps with triumph, on the ut|mo&s;t exacerbations of human mi&s;ery, would then be able to return without horror and de|jection? For, who can congratulate him&s;elf upon a life pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome act more mi&s;|chievous to the peace or pro&s;perity of others, than the theft of a piece of money?</P>
<P>IT has been always the practice, when any particular &s;pecies of robbery becomes preva|lent and common, to endeavour its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion by capital denunciations. Thus, one gene|ration of malefactors is commonly cut off, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are frighted into new expedi|ents; the art of thievery is augmented with greater variety of fraud, and &s;ubtilized to higher degrees of dexterity, and more occult methods of conveyance. The law then re|news the per&s;uit in the heat of anger, and overtakes the offender again with death. By this practice, capital inflictions are multiplied, and crimes very different in their degrees of enormity are equally &s;ubjected to the &s;evere&s;t
<PB N="120" REF="121">
puni&s;hment that man has the power of exer|ci&s;ing upon man.</P>
<P>THE lawgiver is undoubtedly allowed to e&s;timate the malignity of an offence, not merely by the lo&s;s or pain which &s;ingle acts may pro|duce, but by the general alarm and anxiety ari|&s;ing from the fear of mi&s;chief, and in&s;ecurity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: he therefore exerci&s;es the right which &s;ocieties are &s;uppo&s;ed to have over the lives of tho&s;e that compo&s;e them, not &s;imply to puni&s;h a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but to maintain order, and pre|&s;erve quiet; he enforces tho&s;e laws with &s;e|verity that are mo&s;t in danger of violation, as the commander of a garri&s;on doubles the guard on that &s;ide which is threatened by the enemy.</P>
<P>THIS method has been long tried, but tried with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that rapine and violence are hourly encrea&s;ing; yet few &s;eem willing to de&s;pair of its efficacy, and of tho&s;e who employ their &s;peculations upon the pre&s;ent corruption of the people, &s;ome propo&s;e the introduction of more horrid, lingering, and terrifick puni&s;hments; &s;ome are inclined to
<PB N="121" REF="122">
accelerate the executions; &s;ome to di&s;courage pardons; and all &s;eem to think that lenity has given confidence to wickedne&s;s, and that we can only be re&s;cued from the talons of robbery by inflexible rigour, and &s;anguinary ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>YET &s;ince the right of &s;etting an uncertain and arbitrary value upon life has been di&s;puted, and &s;ince experience of pa&s;t times gives us lit|tle rea&s;on to hope that any reformation will be effected by a periodical havock of our fel|low beings, perhaps it will not be u&s;ele&s;s to con&s;ider what con&s;equences might ari&s;e from relaxations of the law, and a more rational and equitable proportion of penalties to of|fences.</P>
<P>DEATH is, as one of the ancients ob&s;erves, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>of dreadful things the mo&s;t dreadful</HI>; an evil, beyond which, no|thing can be threatened by &s;ublunary power, or feared from human enmity or vengeance. This terror &s;hould, therefore, be re&s;erved as the la&s;t re&s;ort of authority, as the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t operative of prohibitory &s;anctions, and placed before the trea&s;ure of life, to guard from inva&s;ion what cannot be re&s;tored. To
<PB N="122" REF="123">
equal robbery with murder is to reduce mur|der to robbery, to confound in common minds the gradations of injury, and incite the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a greater crime, to prevent the de|tection of a le&s;s. If only murder were puni&s;h|ed with death, very few robbers would &s;tain their hands in blood; but when, by the la&s;t act of cruelty no new danger is incurred, and great|er &s;ecurity may probably be obtained, upon what principle &s;hall we bid them forbear?</P>
<P>IT may be urged, that the &s;entence is of|ten mitigated to &s;imple robbery; but &s;urely this is to confe&s;s, that our laws are unrea&s;on|able in our own opinion; and, indeed, it may be ob&s;erved, that all but murderers have, at their la&s;t hour, the common &s;en&s;ations of man|kind pleading in their favour.</P>
<P>FROM this conviction of the inequality of the puni&s;hments to the offence proceeds the frequent &s;olicitation of pardons. They who would rejoice at the correction of a thief, are yet &s;hocked at the thought of de&s;troying him. His crime &s;hrinks to nothing compared, with
<PB N="123" REF="124">
his mi&s;ery; and &s;everity defeats it&s;elf by exci|ting pity.</P>
<P>THE gibbet, indeed, certainly di&s;ables tho&s;e who die upon it from infe&s;ting the com|munity; but their death &s;eems not to contri|bute more to the reformation of their a&s;&s;oci|ates than any other method of &s;eparation. A thief &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es much of his time in recol|lection or anticipation, but from robbery haft|ens to riot, and from riot to robbery; nor, when the grave clo&s;es upon his companion, has any other care than to find another.</P>
<P>THE frequency of capital puni&s;hments therefore rarely hinders the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, but naturally and commonly prevents its detection, and is, if we rea&s;on only upon pru|dential principles, chiefly for that rea&s;on to be avoided. Whatever may be urged by ca|&s;ui&s;ts or politicians, the greater part of man|kind, as they can never think, that to pick the pocket, and to pierce the heart, is equally cri|minal, will &s;carcely believe, that two male|factors &s;o different in guilt can be ju&s;tly doom|ed to the &s;ame puni&s;hment; nor is the nece&s;|&s;ity

of &s;ubmitting the con&s;cience to human laws &s;o plainly evinced, &s;o clearly &s;tated, or &s;o generally allowed, but that the pious, the ten|der, and the ju&s;t, will always &s;cruple to con|cur with the community in an act which their private judgment cannot approve.</P>
<P>HE who knows not how often rigorous laws produce total impunity, and how many crimes are concealed and forgotten for fear of hurrying the offender to that &s;tate in which there is no repentance, has conver&s;ed very lit|tle with mankind. And whatever epithets of reproach or contempt this compa&s;&s;ion may in|cur from tho&s;e who confound cruelty with firmne&s;s, I know not whether any wi&s;e man would wi&s;h it le&s;s powerful, or le&s;s exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e whom the wi&s;dom of our laws has condemned to die, had been detected in their rudiments of robbery, they might by proper di&s;cipline, and u&s;eful labour, have been di&s;en|tangled from their habits, and by e&s;caping all the temptations to &s;ub&s;equent crimes, have pa&s;&s;ed their days in reparation, and penitence; and detected they might all have been, had the pro&s;ecutors been certain, that their lives
<PB N="125" REF="126">
would have been &s;pared. I believe, every thief will confe&s;s, that he has been more than once &s;eized and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and that he has &s;ometimes ventured upon capital crimes, be|cau&s;e he knew, that tho&s;e whom he injured would rather connive at his e&s;cape, than cloud their minds with the horrors of his death.</P>
<P>ALL laws again&s;t crimes are ineffectual, unle&s;s &s;ome will inform, and &s;ome will pro&s;e|cute; but till we mitigate the penalties for mere violations of property, information will always be hated, and pro&s;ecution dreaded. The heart of a good man cannot but recoil at the thought of puni&s;hing a &s;light injury with death; e&s;pecially when he remembers, that the thief might have procured &s;afety by another crime, from which he was re&s;trained only by his remaining virtue.</P>
<P>THE obligations to a&s;&s;i&s;t the exerci&s;e of publick ju&s;tice are indeed &s;trong; but they will certainly be overpowered by tenderne&s;s for life. What is puni&s;hed with &s;everity con|trary to our ideas of adequate retribution, will be &s;eldom di&s;covered; and multitudes will be &s;uffered to advance from crime to crime, till
<PB N="126" REF="127">
they de&s;erve death, becau&s;e if they had been early pro&s;ecuted, they would have &s;uffered death before they de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme of invigorating the laws by relaxation, and extirpating wickedne&s;s by le|nity, is &s;o remote from common practice, that I might rea&s;onably fear to expo&s;e it to the publick, could it be &s;upported only by my own ob&s;ervations: I &s;hall, therefore, by a&s;|cribing it to its author, Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> en|deavour to procure it that attention, which I wi&s;h always paid to prudence, to ju&s;tice, and to mercy.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sit down in pur&s;uance of my late engage|ment to recount the remaining part of the adventures that befel me in my long que&s;t of conjugal felicity, which, though I have not yet been &s;o happy as to obtain it, I have at lea&s;t endeavoured to de&s;erve by unwearied di|ligence, without &s;uffering from repeated di&s;|appointments any abatement of my hope or re|pre&s;&s;ion of my activity.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t have ob&s;erved in the world a &s;pecies of mortals who employ them&s;elves in promoting matrimony, and without any vi&s;ible motive of intere&s;t or vanity, without any di&s;|coverable impul&s;e of malice or benevolence,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
without any rea&s;on, but that they want ob|jects of attention, and topicks of conver&s;ation, are ince&s;&s;antly bu&s;y in procuring wives and hu&s;bands, fill the ears of every &s;ingle man and woman with &s;ome convenient match, and when they are informed of your age and for|tune, offer a partner of life with the &s;ame readine&s;s, and the &s;ame indifference, as a &s;ale&s;|man, when he has taken mea&s;ure by his eye, fits his cu&s;tomer with a coat.</P>
<P>IT might be expected that they &s;hould &s;oon be di&s;couraged from this officious interpo&s;ition by re&s;entment or contempt; and that every man &s;hould determine the choice on which &s;o much of his happine&s;s mu&s;t depend, by his own judgment and ob&s;ervation: yet it hap|pens, that as the&s;e propo&s;als are generally made with a &s;hew of kindne&s;s, they &s;eldom pro|voke anger, but are at wor&s;t heard with pa|tience, and forgotten. They influence weak minds to approbation; for many are &s;ure to find in a new acquaintance, whatever qualities report has taught them to expect; and in more powerful and active under&s;tandings they excite curio&s;ity, and &s;ometimes by a lucky
<PB N="129" REF="130">
chance bring per&s;ons of &s;imilar tempers within the attraction of each other.</P>
<P>I WAS known to po&s;&s;e&s;s a fortune, and to want a wife; and therefore was frequently at|tended by the&s;e hymeneal &s;olicitors, with who&s;e importunity I was &s;ometimes diverted, and &s;ometimes perplexed; for they contended for me as vulturs for a carca&s;e; each employed all his eloquence, and all his artifices, to en|force and promote his own &s;cheme, from the &s;ucce&s;s of which he was to receive no other advantage than the plea&s;ure of defeating others equally eager, and equally indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>AN invitation to &s;up with one of tho&s;e bu&s;y friends, made me by a concerted chance ac|quainted with <HI>Camilla,</HI> by whom it was ex|pected, that I &s;hould be &s;uddenly and irre&s;i&s;ti|bly en&s;laved. The lady, whom the &s;ame kindne&s;s had brought without her own con|currence into the li&s;ts of love, &s;eemed to think me at lea&s;t worthy of the honour of captivity; and exerted the power, both of her eyes and wit, with &s;o much art and &s;pirit, that though I had been too often deceived by appearances to devote my&s;elf irrevocably at the fir&s;t inter|view,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
yet I could not &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome raptures of admiration, and flutters of de&s;ire. I was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to make nearer approaches; but &s;oon di&s;covered, that an union with <HI>Ca|milla</HI> was not much to be wi&s;hed. <HI>Camilla</HI> profe&s;&s;ed a boundle&s;s contempt for the folly, levity, ignorance, and impertinence of her own &s;ex; and very frequently expre&s;&s;ed her wonder, that men of learning or experience could &s;ubmit to trifle away life, with beings incapable of &s;olid thought. In mixed com|panies, &s;he always a&s;&s;ociated with the men, and declared her &s;atisfaction when the ladies retired. If any &s;hort excur&s;ion into the coun|try was propo&s;ed, &s;he commonly in&s;i&s;ted upon the exclu&s;ion of women from the party; be|cau&s;e, where they were admitted, the time was wa&s;ted in frothy compliments, weak in|dulgences, and idle ceremonies. To &s;hew the greatne&s;s of her mind, &s;he avoided all com|pliance with the fa&s;hion; and to boa&s;t the pro|fundity of her knowledge, mi&s;took the vari|ous textures of &s;ilk, confounded tabbies with dama&s;ks, and &s;ent for ribbands by wrong names. She de&s;pi&s;ed the commerce of &s;tated vi&s;its, a farce of empty form without in&s;tru|ction; and congratulated her&s;elf, that &s;he never
<PB N="131" REF="132">
learned the low &s;tile of me&s;&s;age-cards. She often applauded the noble &s;entiment of <HI>Plato,</HI> who rejoiced that he was born a man rather than a woman; proclaimed her approbation of <HI>Swift</HI>'s opinion, that women are only a higher &s;pecies of monkies; and confe&s;&s;ed, that when &s;he con&s;idered the behaviour, or heard the conver&s;ation, of her &s;ex, &s;he could not but forgive the <HI>Turks</HI> for &s;u&s;pecting them to want &s;ouls.</P>
<P>IT was the joy and pride of <HI>Camilla</HI> to have provoked, by this in&s;olence, all the rage of ha|tred, and all the per&s;ecutions of calumny; nor was &s;he ever more elevated with her own &s;u|periority, than when &s;he talked of female anger, and female cunning. Well, &s;ays &s;he, has nature provided that &s;uch virulence &s;hould be di&s;abled by folly, and &s;uch cruelty be re|&s;trained by impotence.</P>
<P>CAMILLA doubtle&s;s expected, that what &s;he lo&s;t on one &s;ide, &s;he &s;hould gain on the other; and imagined that every male heart would be open to a lady, who made &s;uch ge|nerous advances to the borders of virility. But man, ungrateful man, in&s;tead of &s;pringing forward to meet her, &s;hrunk back at her ap|proach.
<PB N="132" REF="133">
She was per&s;ecuted by the ladies as a de&s;erter, and at be&s;t received by the men only as a fugitive. I, for my part, amu&s;ed my&s;elf a while with her fopperies, but novelty &s;oon gave way to dete&s;tation, for nothing out of the common order of nature can be long borne. I had no inclination to a wife who had the rug|gedne&s;s of man without his force, and the ig|norance of woman without her &s;oftne&s;s; nor could I think it my quiet and honour to be tru&s;ted to &s;uch audacious virtue as was hour|ly courting danger, and &s;oliciting a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>MY next mi&s;tre&s;s was <HI>Nitella,</HI> a lady of gentle mien, and &s;oft voice, always &s;peaking to approve, and ready to receive direction from tho&s;e with whom chance had brought her into company. In <HI>Nitella</HI> I promi&s;ed my&s;elf an ea&s;y friend, with whom I might loiter away the day without di&s;turbance or altercation. I therefore &s;oon re&s;olved to addre&s;s her, but was di&s;couraged from pro&s;ecuting my court&s;hip by ob&s;erving, that her apartments were &s;uper&s;ti|tiou&s;ly regular; and that, unle&s;s &s;he had no|tice of my vi&s;it, &s;he was never to be &s;een. There is a kind of anxious cleanline&s;s which I have always noted as the characteri&s;tick of a
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;lattern; it is the &s;uperfluous &s;crupulo&s;ity of guilt, dreading di&s;covery, and &s;hunning &s;u|&s;picion: it is the violence of an effort again&s;t habit, which, being impelled by external mo|tives, cannot &s;top at the middle point.</P>
<P>NITELLA was always tricked out rather with nicety than with elegance; and &s;eldom could forbear to di&s;cover by her unea&s;ine&s;s and con&s;traint, that her attention was burdened, and her imagination engro&s;&s;ed: I therefore concluded, that being only occa&s;ionally and ambitiou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he was not familiarized to her own ornaments. There are &s;o many competitors for the &s;ame of cleanline&s;s, that it is not hard to gain information of tho&s;e that fail, from tho&s;e that de&s;ire to excel: I quickly found, that <HI>Nitella</HI> pa&s;&s;ed her time between finery and dirt; and was always in a wrapper, night-cap, and &s;lippers, when &s;he was not de|corated for immediate &s;hew.</P>
<P>I WAS then led by my evil de&s;tiny to <HI>Charybdis,</HI> who never neglected an opportu|nity of &s;eizing a new prey when it came with|in her reach. I thought my&s;elf quickly made happy by a permi&s;&s;ion to attend her to pub|lick places; and plea&s;ed my own vanity with
<PB N="134" REF="135">
imagining the envy which I &s;hould rai&s;e in a thou&s;and hearts, by appearing as the acknow|ledged favourite of <HI>Charybdis.</HI> She &s;oon after hinted her intention to take a ramble for a fortnight, into a part of the kingdom which &s;he had never &s;een. I &s;olicited the happine&s;s of accompanying her, which, after a &s;hort reluctance, was indulged me. She had no other curio&s;ity in her journey, than after all po&s;&s;ible means of expence; and was every mo|ment taking occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome deli|cacy, which I knew it my duty upon &s;uch notices to procure.</P>
<P>AFTER our return, being now more fa|miliar, &s;he told me, whenever we met, of &s;ome new diver&s;ion; at night &s;he had always notice of a charming company that would breakfa&s;t in the gardens; and in the morning &s;he had been informed of &s;ome new &s;ong in the opera, &s;ome new dre&s;s at the play-hou&s;e, or &s;ome performer at a concert whom &s;he long|ed to hear. Her intelligence was &s;uch, that there never was a &s;hew, to which &s;he did not &s;ummon me on the &s;econd day; and as &s;he hated a croud, and could not go alone, I was obliged to attend at &s;ome intermediate hour,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
and pay the price of a whole company. When we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, &s;he was often charmed with &s;ome trinket in the toy-&s;hops; and from moderate de&s;ires of &s;eals and &s;nuff-boxes, ro&s;e, by degrees, to gold and diamonds. I now began to find the &s;mile of <HI>Charybdis</HI> too co&s;tly for a private pur&s;e, and added one more to &s;ix and forty lovers, who&s;e fortune and patience her rapacity had exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>IMPERIA then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my affe|ctions; but kept them only for a &s;hort time. She had newly inherited a large fortune, and, having &s;pent the early part of her life in the peru&s;al of romances, brought with her into the gay world all the pride of <HI>Cleopatra</HI>; ex|pected nothing le&s;s than vows, altars, and &s;a|crifices; and thought her charms di&s;honoured, and her power infringed, by the &s;ofte&s;t oppo&s;i|tion to her &s;entiments, or the &s;malle&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of her commands. Time might in|deed cure this &s;pecies of pride in a mind not naturally undi&s;cerning, and vitiated only by fal&s;e repre&s;entations; but the operations of time are &s;low; and I therefore left her to grow wi&s;e at lei&s;ure, or to continue in error at her own expence.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
THUS I have hitherto, in &s;pite of my&s;elf, pa&s;&s;ed my life in frozen celibacy. My friends, indeed, often tell me, that I flatter my ima|gination with higher hopes than human nature can gratify; that I dre&s;s up an ideal charmer in all the radiance of perfection, and then en|ter the world to look for the &s;ame excel|lence in corporeal beauty. But &s;urely, Mr. RAMBLER, it is not madne&s;s to hope for &s;ome terre&s;trial lady un&s;tained with the &s;pots which I have been de&s;cribing; at lea&s;t, I am re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my &s;earch; for I am &s;o far from thinking meanly of marriage, that I believe it able to afford the highe&s;t happine&s;s decreed to our pre&s;ent &s;tate; and if after all the&s;e mi&s;|carriages I find a woman that fills up my ex|pectation, you &s;hall hear once more from</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was the &s;econd &s;on of a country gentle|man by the daughter of a wealthy citizen of <HI>London.</HI> My father, having by his mar|riage freed the e&s;tate from a heavy mortgage, and paid his &s;i&s;ters their portions, thought him|&s;elf di&s;charged from all obligation to farther thought, and entitled to &s;pend the re&s;t of his life in rural plea&s;ures. He therefore &s;pared nothing that might contribute to the comple|tion of his felicity; he procured the be&s;t guns and hor&s;es that the kingdom could &s;upply, paid large &s;alaries to his groom and hunt&s;man, and became the envy of the county for the di&s;ci|pline of his hounds. But above all his other attainments, he was eminent for a breed of
<PB N="138" REF="139">
pointers and &s;etting dogs, which by long and vigilant cultivation he had &s;o much improved, that not a partridge or heathcock could re&s;t in &s;ecurity, and game of whatever &s;pecies that dared to light upon his manor, was beaten down by his &s;hot, or covered with his nets.</P>
<P>MY elder brother was very early initiated in the chace, and at an age when other boys are <HI>creeping like &s;nails unwillingly to &s;chool,</HI> he could wind the horn, beat the bu&s;hes, bound over hedges, and &s;wim rivers. When the hunt&s;man one day broke his leg, he &s;up|plied his place with equal abilities, and came home with the &s;cut in his hat, amid&s;t the ac|clamations of the whole village. I being either delicate, or timorous, le&s;s de&s;irous of honour, or le&s;s capable of &s;ylvan heroi&s;m, was always the favourite of my mother; becau&s;e I kept my coat clean, and my complexion free from freckles, and did not come home like my brother mired and tanned, nor carry corn in my hat to the hor&s;e, nor bring dirty curs into the parlour.</P>
<P>MY mother had not been taught to amu&s;e her&s;elf with books, and being much inclined
<PB N="139" REF="140">
to de&s;pi&s;e the ignorance and barbarity of the country ladies, di&s;dained to learn their &s;enti|ments or conver&s;ation, and had made no ad|dition to the notions which &s;he had brought from the precincts of <HI>Cornhill.</HI> She was, therefore, always recounting the glories of the city; enumerating the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mayors; celebrating the magnificence of the banquets at <HI>Guildhall</HI>; and relating the civili|ties paid her at the companies fea&s;ts by men, of whom &s;ome are now made aldermen, &s;ome have fined for &s;heriffs, and none are worth le&s;s than forty thou&s;and pounds. She frequently di&s;plaid her father's greatne&s;s; told of the large bills which he had paid at &s;ight; of the &s;ums for which his word would pa&s;s upon the ex|change; the heaps of gold which he u&s;ed on <HI>Saturday</HI> night to to&s;s about with a &s;hovel; the extent of his warehou&s;e, and the &s;trength of his doors; and when &s;he relaxed her ima|gination with lower &s;ubjects, de&s;cribed the furniture of their country-hou&s;e, or repeated the wit of the clerks and porters.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e narratives I was fired with the &s;plendor and dignity of <HI>London,</HI> and of trade. I therefore devoted my&s;elf to a &s;hop, and
<PB N="140" REF="141">
warmed my imagination from year to year with enquiries about the privileges of a free|man, the power of the common council, the dignity of a whole&s;ale dealer, and the grandeur of mayoralty, to which my mother a&s;&s;ured me that many had arrived who began the world with le&s;s than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I WAS very impatient to enter into a path, which led to &s;uch honour and felicity; but was forced for a time to endure &s;ome re|pre&s;&s;ion of my eagerne&s;s, for it was my grandfather's maxim, that <HI>a young man &s;eldom makes much money, who is out of his time before two-and-twenty.</HI> They thought it nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to keep me at home till the proper age, without any other employment than that of learning merchants accounts, and the art of regulating books; but at length the tedious days elap&s;ed, I was tran&s;planted to town, and, with great &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, bound to a haberda&s;her.</P>
<P>MY ma&s;ter, who had no conception of any virtue, merit, or dignity, but that of being rich, had all the good qualities which naturally ari&s;e from a clo&s;e and unwearied attention to
<PB N="141" REF="142">
the main chance: his de&s;ire to gain wealth was &s;o well tempered by the vanity of &s;hew|ing it, that without any other principle of action, he lived in the e&s;teem of the whole commercial world; and was always treated with re&s;pect by the only men, who&s;e good opinion he valued or &s;olicited, tho&s;e who were univer&s;ally allowed to be richer than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BY his in&s;tructions I learned in a few weeks to handle a yard with great dexterity, to wind tape neatly upon the ends of my fingers, and to make up parcels with exact frugality of paper and packthread; and &s;oon caught from my fellow apprentices, the true grace of a counter bow, the carele&s;s air with which a &s;mall pair of &s;cales is to be held between the fingers, and the vigour and &s;prightline&s;s with which the box, after the ribband has been cut, is returned into its place. Having no de&s;ire of any higher employment, and, there|fore, applying all my powers to the know|ledge of my trade, I was quickly ma&s;ter of all that could be known, became a critick in &s;mall wares, contrived new variations of fi|gures, and new mixtures of colours, and was
<PB N="142" REF="143">
&s;ometimes con&s;ulted by the weavers when they projected fa&s;hions for the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>WITH all the&s;e accompli&s;hments, in the fourth year of my apprentice&s;hip, I paid a vi&s;it to my friends in the country, where I expected to be received as a new ornament of the fami|ly, and con&s;ulted by the neighbouring gentle|men as a ma&s;ter of pecuniary knowledge, and by the ladies as an oracle of the mode. But unhappily at the fir&s;t publick table to which I was invited, appeared a &s;tudent of the temple, and an officer of the guards, who looked up|on me with a &s;mile of contempt, which de|&s;troyed at once all my hopes of di&s;tinction, &s;o that I dur&s;t hardly rai&s;e my eyes for fear of en|countering their &s;uperiority of mien. Nor was my courage revived by any opportunities of di&s;playing my knowledge; for the templar entertained the company for part of the day with hi&s;torical narratives, and political ob&s;er|vations; and the colonel afterwards detailed the adventures of a birth-night, told the claims and expectations of the courtiers, and gave an account of a&s;&s;emblies, gardens, and diver&s;ions. I, indeed, e&s;&s;ayed to fill up a pau&s;e in a parlia|mentary debate with a &s;aint mention of trade,
<PB N="143" REF="144">
and <HI>Spaniards</HI>; and once attempted with &s;ome wramth, to correct a gro&s;s mi&s;take about a &s;ilver brea&s;t-knot; but neither of my antago|ni&s;ts &s;eemed to think a reply nece&s;&s;ary; they re&s;umed their di&s;cour&s;e without emotion, and again engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the company; nor did one of the ladies appear de&s;irous to know my opinion of her dre&s;s, or to hear how long the carnation &s;hot with white that was then new among&s;t them had been antiquated in town.</P>
<P>AS I knew that neither of the&s;e gentle|men had more money than my&s;elf, I could not di&s;cover what had depre&s;&s;ed me in their pre&s;ence; nor why they were con&s;idered by others as more worthy of attention and re|&s;pect; and therefore re&s;olved, when we met again, to rou&s;e my &s;pirit, and force my&s;elf into notice. I went very early to the follow|ing weekly meeting, and was entertaining a &s;mall circle very &s;ucce&s;sfully with a minute repre&s;entation of my lord mayor's &s;hew, when the colonel entered carele&s;s and gay, &s;at down with a kind of unceremonious civility, and without appearing to intend any interrup|tion, drew my audience away to the other
<PB N="144" REF="145">
part of the room, to which I had not the courage to follow them. Soon after came in the lawyer, not indeed with the &s;ame attrac|tion of mien, but with greater powers of lan|guage; and by one or other the company was &s;o happily amu&s;ed, that I was neither heard nor &s;een, nor was able to give any other proof of my exi&s;tence than that I put round the gla&s;s, and was in my turn permitted to name the toa&s;t.</P>
<P>MY mother indeed endeavoured to comfort me in my vexation, by telling me, that per|haps the&s;e &s;howy talkers were hardly able to pay every one his own; that he who has mo|ney in his pocket needs not care what any man &s;ays of him; that, if I minded my trade, the time would come when lawyers and &s;ol|diers would be glad to borrow out of my pur&s;e; and that it is fine, when a man can &s;et his hands to his &s;ides, and &s;ay he is worth forty thou&s;and pounds every day of the year. The&s;e, and many more &s;uch con&s;olations and encouragements, I received from my good mother, which however did not much allay my unea&s;ine&s;s; for, having by &s;ome accident heard, that the country ladies de&s;pi&s;ed her as a

cit, I had therefore no longer much reverence for her opinions, but con&s;idered her as one who&s;e ignorance and prejudice had hurried me, though without ill intentions, into a &s;tate of meanne&s;s and ignominy, from which I could not find any po&s;&s;ibility of ri&s;ing to the rank which my ance&s;tors had always held.</P>
<P>I RETURNED, however, to my ma&s;ter, and bu&s;ied my&s;elf among thread, and &s;ilk, and laces, but without my former chearfulne&s;s or ala|crity. I had now no longer any felicity in contemplating the exact di&s;po&s;ition of my powdered curls, the equal plaits of my ruffles, or the glo&s;&s;y blackne&s;s of my &s;hoes; nor heard with my former elevation tho&s;e compliments which ladies &s;ometimes conde&s;cended to pay me upon my readine&s;s in twi&s;ting a paper, or counting out the change. The term of <HI>Young man,</HI> with which I was &s;ometimes honoured as I carried a parcel to the door of a coach, tor|tured my imagination; I grew negligent of my per&s;on, and &s;ullen in my temper, often mi&s;took the demands of the cu&s;tomers, treated their caprices and objections with contempt, and received and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with &s;urly &s;i|lence.</P>

My ma&s;ter was afraid le&s;t the &s;hop &s;hould &s;uffer by this change of my behaviour, and, therefore, after &s;ome expo&s;tulations, po&s;ted me in the warehou&s;e, and pre&s;erved me from the danger and reproach of de&s;ertion, to which my di&s;content would certainly have urged me, had I continued any longer behind the counter.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth year of my &s;ervitude my bro|ther died of drunken joy, for having run down a fox that had baffled all the packs in the province. I was now heir, and with the hearty con&s;ent of my ma&s;ter commenced gentleman. The adventures in which my new character engaged me &s;hall be communicated in another letter, by, Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING has more retarded the ad|vancement of learning than the di&s;|po&s;ition of vulgar minds to ridicule and vilify what they cannot comprehend. All indu&s;try mu&s;t be excited by hope; and as the &s;tudent often propo&s;es no other reward to him&s;elf than prai&s;e, he is ea&s;ily di&s;couraged by contempt and in&s;ult. He who brings with him into a clamorous multitude the timidity of reclu&s;e &s;peculation, and has never hardened his front in publick life, nor accu&s;tomed his pa&s;&s;ions to the vici&s;&s;itudes and accidents, the triumphs and defeats of mixed conver&s;ation, will blu&s;h at the &s;tare of petulant incredulity, and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be driven, by a bur&s;t of laughter, from the fortre&s;&s;es of demon&s;tration. The mechani&s;t will be afraid to a&s;&s;ert before hardy contradiction, the po&s;&s;ibility of tearing down
<PB N="148" REF="149">
bulwarks with a &s;ilk-worm's thread; and the a&s;tronomer of relating the rapidity of light, the di&s;tance of the fixed &s;tars, and the height of the lunar mountains.</P>
<P>IF I could by any efforts have &s;haken off this cowardice, I had not &s;heltered my&s;elf un|der a borrowed name, nor applied to you for the means of communicating to the public the theory of a garret; a &s;ubject which, except &s;ome &s;light and tran&s;ient &s;trictures, has been hitherto neglected by tho&s;e who were be&s;t qua|lified to adorn it, either for want of lei&s;ure to pro&s;ecute the various re&s;earches in which a nice di&s;cu&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily engage them, or becau&s;e it requires &s;uch diver&s;ity of know|ledge, and &s;uch extent of curio&s;ity, as is &s;carce|ly to be found in any &s;ingle intellect; or per|haps others, having more &s;agacity than my&s;elf, fore&s;aw the tumults which would be rai&s;ed again&s;t them, and con&s;idering that it was vain to write what they dur&s;t not publi&s;h, confined their knowledge to their own brea&s;ts, and abandoned prejudice and folly to the direction of chance.</P>
<P>THAT the profe&s;&s;ors of literature generally
<PB N="149" REF="150">
re&s;ide in the highe&s;t &s;tories, has been immemo|rially ob&s;erved. The wi&s;dom of the ancients was well acquainted with the intellectual ad|vantages of an elevated &s;ituation: why el&s;e were the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> &s;tationed on <HI>Olympus</HI> or <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us</HI> by tho&s;e who could with equal right have rai&s;ed them bowers in the vale of <HI>Tempe,</HI> or erected their altars among the flexures of <HI>Meander?</HI> Why was <HI>Jove</HI> him&s;elf nur&s;ed up|on a mountain? or why did the goodde&s;&s;es, when the prize of beauty was conte&s;ted, try the cau&s;e upon the top of <HI>Ida?</HI> Such were the fictions by which the great ma&s;ters of the earlier ages endeavoured to inculcate to po&s;te|rity the importance of a garret, which, though they had been long ob&s;cured by the negligence and ignorance of &s;ucceeding times, were well enforced by the celebrated &s;ymbol of <HI>Pythago|ras,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">; "when the wind blows, wor&s;hip its echo." This could not but be under&s;tood by his di&s;ciples as an inviolable injunction to live in a garret, which I have found frequently vi&s;ited by the echo and the wind. Nor was the tra|dition wholly obliterated in the age of <HI>Augu|&s;tus,</HI> for <HI>Tibullus</HI> evidently congratulates him|&s;elf
<PB N="150" REF="151">
upon his garret, not without &s;ome allu|&s;ion to the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> precept. <Q><L>Qu&agrave;m juvat immites ventos audire cubantem&mdash;</L>
<L>Aut, gelidas hybernus aquas c&ugrave;m fuderit au&s;ter,</L>
<L>Securum &s;omnos, imbre juvante, &s;equi!</L></Q> And it is impo&s;&s;ible not to di&s;cover the fond|ne&s;s of <HI>Lucretius,</HI> an earlier writer, for a garret, in his de&s;cription of the lofty to wers of &s;erene learning, and of the plea&s;ure with which a wi&s;e man looks down upon the confu&s;ed and erratic &s;tate of the world moving below him. <Q><L>Sed nil dulcius e&s;t, bene qu&agrave;m munita tenere</L>

<L>De&s;picere unde queas alios, pa&s;&s;im&abque; videre</L>
<L>Errare, atque viam palanteis quaerere vitae.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE in&s;titution has, indeed, continued to our own time; the garret is &s;till the u&s;ual re|ceptacle of the philo&s;opher and poet; but this, like many ancient cu&s;toms, is perpetuated only by an accidental imitation, without knowledge of the original rea&s;on for which it was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. <HI>Cau&s;a latet</HI>; <HI>res e&s;t noti&s;&s;ima.</HI>Con|jectures have, indeed, been advanced con|cerning the&s;e habitations of literature, but
<PB N="151" REF="152">
without much &s;atisfaction to the judicious en|quirer. Some have imagined, that the garret is generally cho&s;en by the wits, as mo&s;t ea&s;ily rented; and concluded that no man rejoices in his aereal abode, but on the days of pay|ment. Others &s;u&s;pect, that a garret is chiefly convenient, as it is remoter than any other part of the hou&s;e from the outer door, which is often ob&s;erved to be infe&s;ted by vi&s;itants, who talk ince&s;&s;antly of beer, or linen, or a coat, and repeat the &s;ame &s;ounds every morn|ing, and &s;ometimes again in the afternoon, without any variation, except that they grow daily more importunate and clamorous, and rai&s;e their voices in time from mournful murmurs to raging vociferations. This eternal monotony is always dete&s;table to a man who&s;e chief plea&s;ure is to enlarge his knowledge, and vary his ideas. Others talk of freedom from noi&s;e, and ab&s;traction from common bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ements; and &s;ome, yet more vi&s;ionary, tell us that the faculties are inlarged by open pro&s;pects, and that the fancy is more at liber|ty, when the eye ranges without confinement.</P>
<P>THESE conveniencies may perhaps all be found in a well cho&s;en garret; but &s;urely they
<PB N="152" REF="153">
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficiently important to have operated unvariably upon different cli|mates, di&s;tant ages, and &s;eparate nations. Of an univer&s;al practice, there mu&s;t &s;till be pre|&s;umed an univer&s;al cau&s;e, which, however re|condite and ab&s;tru&s;e, may be perhaps re&s;erved to make me illu&s;trious by its di&s;covery, and you by its promulgation.</P>
<P>IT is univer&s;ally known, that the faculties of the mind are invigorated or weakened by the &s;tate of the body, and that the body is in a great mea&s;ure regulated by the various com|pre&s;&s;ions of the ambient element. The ef|fects of the air in the production or cure of corporal maladies have been acknowledged from the time of <HI>Hippocrates</HI>; but no man has yet &s;ufficiently con&s;idered how far it may influence the operations of the genius, though every day affords in&s;tances of local under|&s;tanding, of wits and rea&s;oners, who&s;e facul|ties are adapted to &s;ome &s;ingle &s;pot, and who, when they are removed to any other place &s;ink at once into &s;ilence and &s;tupidity. I have di&s;|covered by a long &s;eries of ob&s;ervations, that invention and elocution &s;uffer great impedi|ments from den&s;e and impure vapours, and
<PB N="153" REF="154">
that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper di&s;tance from the &s;urface of the earth, accele|rates the fancy, and &s;ets at liberty tho&s;e intel|lectual powers which were before &s;hackled by too &s;trong attraction, and unable to expand them&s;elves under the pre&s;&s;ure of a gro&s;s at|mo&s;phere. I have found dulne&s;s to quicken into &s;entiment in a thin ether, as water, though not very hot, boils in a receiver part|ly exhau&s;ted; and heads in appearance empty have teemed with notions upon ri&s;ing ground, as the flaccid &s;ides of a football would have &s;welled out into &s;tiffne&s;s and exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on I never think my&s;elf quali|fied to judge deci&s;ively of any man's faculties, whom I have only known in one degree of elevation; but take &s;ome opportunity of at|tending him from the cellar to the garret, and try upon him all the various degrees of rare|faction and conden&s;ation, ten&s;ion and laxity. If he is neither vivacious aloft, nor &s;erious be|low, I then con&s;ider him as hopele&s;s; but as it &s;eldom happens, that I do not find the tem|per to which the texture of his brain is fitted, I accommodate him in time with a tube of mercury, fir&s;t marking the point mo&s;t favour|able
<PB N="154" REF="155">
to his intellects, according to rules which I have long &s;tudied, and which I may, per|haps, reveal to mankind in a complete treati&s;e of barometrical pneumatology.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e of the gaiety and &s;pright|line&s;s of the dwellers in garrets is probably the encrea&s;e of that vertiginous motion, with which we are carried round by the diurnal re|volution of the earth. The power of agita|tion upon the &s;pirits is well known; every man has felt his heart lightened in a rapid ve|hicle, or on a galloping hor&s;e; and nothing is plainer, than that he who towers to the fifth &s;tory, is whirled through more &s;pace by every circumrotation, than another that grovels upon the ground-floor. The nations between the tropicks, are known to be fiery, incon&s;tant, inventive, and fanciful, becau&s;e, living at the utmo&s;t length of the earth's diameter, they are carried about with more &s;wiftne&s;s than tho&s;e whom nature has placed nearer to the poles; and therefore, as it becomes a wi&s;e man to &s;truggle with the inconveniences of his country, whenever celerity and acutene&s;s are requi&s;ite, we mu&s;t actuate our languor by taking a few turns round the center in a garret.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">
IF you imagine that I a&s;cribe to air and mo|tion effects which they cannot produce, I de|&s;ire you to con&s;ult your own memory, and con&s;ider whether you have never known a man acquire reputation in his garret, which, when fortune or a patron had placed him upon the fir&s;t floor, he was unable to maintain; and who never recovered his former vigour of under&s;tanding till he was re&s;tored to his original &s;ituation. That a garret will make every man a wit, I am very far from &s;uppo&s;ing; I know there are &s;ome who would continue blockheads even on the &s;ummit of the <HI>Andes,</HI> or on the pic of <HI>Teneriffe.</HI> But let not any man be con&s;idered as unimproveable till this potent remedy has been tried; for perhaps, he was formed to be great only in a garret, as the joiner of <HI>Aretaeus</HI> was rational in no other place but his own &s;hop.</P>
<P>I THINK a frequent removal to various di&s;tances from the center &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to a ju&s;t e&s;timate of intellectual abilities, and con&s;e|quently of &s;o great u&s;e in education, that if I hoped that the public could be per&s;uaded to &s;o expen&s;ive an experiment, I would propo&s;e,
<PB N="156" REF="157">
that there &s;hould be a cavern dug, and a tower erected, like tho&s;e which <HI>Bacon</HI> de&s;cribes in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s hou&s;e, for the expan&s;ion and con|centration of under&s;tanding, according to the exigence of different employments, or con|&s;titutions. Perhaps &s;ome that fume away in meditations upon time and &s;pace in the tower, might compo&s;e tables of intere&s;t at a certain depth; and he that upon level ground &s;tag|nates in &s;ilence, or creeps in narrative, might, at the height of half a mile, ferment into merriment, &s;parkle with repartee, and froth with declamation.</P>
<P>ADDISON ob&s;erves that we may find the heat of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s climate, in &s;ome lines of his <HI>Georgic:</HI> &s;o, when I read a compo&s;ition, I immediately determine the height of the au|thor's habitation. As an elaborate perform|ance is commonly &s;aid to &s;mell of the lamp, my commendation of a noble thought, a &s;prightly fally, or a bold figure, is to pro|nounce it fre&s;h from the garret; an expre&s;&s;ion which would break from me upon the peru&s;al of mo&s;t of your papers, did I not believe, that you &s;ometimes quit the garret, and a&s;cend into the cock-loft.</P>

<P><HI>CICERO</HI> has, with his u&s;ual elegance and magnificence of language, attempt|ed, in his relation of the dream of <HI>Scipio,</HI> to depreciate tho&s;e honours for which he him&s;elf appears to have panted with re&s;tle&s;s and impor|tunate &s;olicitude, by &s;hewing within what nar|row limits all that fame and celebrity which man can hope from men is circum&s;cribed.</P>
<P>"YOU &s;ee," &s;ays <HI>Africanus,</HI> pointing at the earth from the cele&s;tial regions, "that the globe a&s;&s;igned to the re&s;idence and ha|bitation of human beings is of &s;mall dimen|&s;ions: how then can you obtain from the prai&s;e of men, any glory worthy of a wi&s;h? Of this little world the inhabited parts are neither numerous nor wide; even the &s;pots where men are found are broken by inter|vening de&s;arts; and the nations are &s;o &s;epa|rated
<PB N="158" REF="159">
as that nothing can be tran&s;mitted from one to another. With the people of the &s;outh, by whom the oppo&s;ite part of the earth is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, you have no inter|cour&s;e; and by how &s;mall a tract do you communicate with the countries of the north? The territory which you inhabit is no more than a &s;canty i&s;land, inclo&s;ed by a &s;mall body of water, to which you give the name of the great &s;ea, and the <HI>Atlantick</HI> ocean. And even in this known and fre|quented continent, what hope can you en|tertain, that your renown will pa&s;s the &s;tream of <HI>Ganges,</HI> or the cliffs of <HI>Cauca&s;us?</HI> or by whom will your name be uttered in the extremities of the north or &s;outh, to|wards the ri&s;ing or the &s;etting &s;un? So nar|row is the &s;pace to which your fame can be propagated, and even there how long will it remain?"</P>
<P>HE then proceeds to a&s;&s;ign natural cau&s;es why fame is not only narrow in its extent, but &s;hort in its duration; he ob&s;erves the dif|ference between the computation of time in earth and heaven, and declares, that accord|ing
<PB N="159" REF="160">
to the cele&s;tial chronology, no human honours can la&s;t a &s;ingle year.</P>
<P>SUCH are the objections by which <HI>Tully</HI> has made a &s;hew of di&s;couraging the per&s;uit of fame; objections which &s;ufficiently di&s;cover his tenderne&s;s and regard for his darling phan|tom. <HI>Homer,</HI> when the plan of his poem made the death of <HI>Patroclus</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, re|&s;olved, at lea&s;t, that he &s;hould die with honour; and, therefore, brought down again&s;t him the patron god of <HI>Troy,</HI> and left to <HI>Hector</HI> only the mean ta&s;k of giving the la&s;t blow to an enemy whom a divine hand had di&s;abled from re&s;i&s;tance. Thus <HI>Tully</HI> ennobles fame, which he profe&s;&s;es to degrade by oppo&s;ing it to cele|&s;tial happine&s;s; he confines not its extent but by the boundaries of nature, nor contracts its duration but by repre&s;enting it &s;mall in the e&s;timation of &s;uperior beings. He &s;till admits it the highe&s;t and noble&s;t of terre&s;trial objects, and alleges little more again&s;t it, than that it is neither without end, nor without limits.</P>
<P>WHAT might be the effect of the&s;e ob&s;er|vations conveyed in <HI>Ciceronian</HI> eloquence to <HI>Roman</HI> under&s;tandings, cannot be determined;
<PB N="160" REF="161">
but few of tho&s;e who &s;hall in the pre&s;ent age read my humble ver&s;ion will find them&s;elves much depre&s;&s;ed in their hopes, or retarded in their de&s;igns; for I am not inclined to believe, that they who among us pa&s;s their lives in the cultivating of knowledge, or the acqui&s;ition of power, have very anxiou&s;ly enquired what opinions prevail on the farther banks of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> or have invigorated any effort by the de&s;ire of &s;preading their renown among the clans of <HI>Cauca&s;us.</HI> The hopes and fears of modern minds are content to range in a nar|rower compa&s;s; a &s;ingle nation, and a few years, have generally &s;ufficient amplitude to fill our imagination.</P>
<P>A LITTLE con&s;ideration will indeed teach us, that fame has other limits than mountains and oceans; and that he who places happine&s;s in the frequent repetition of his name, may &s;pend his life in propagating it, without any danger of weeping for new worlds, or ne|ce&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Atlantick</HI> &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE numbers to whom any real and per|ceptible good or evil can be derived by the greate&s;t power, or mo&s;t active diligence, are
<PB N="161" REF="162">
incon&s;iderable; and where neither benefit nor mi&s;chief operate, the only motive to the mention or remembrance of others is curio&s;i|ty; a pa&s;&s;ion, which, though in &s;ome degree univer&s;ally a&s;&s;ociated with rea&s;on, is ea&s;ily confined, overborn, or diverted from any par|ticular object.</P>
<P>AMONG the lower cla&s;&s;es of mankind, there will be found very little de&s;ire of any other knowledge, than what may contribute imme|diately to the relief of &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing unea&s;i|ne&s;s, or the attainment of &s;ome near advan|tage. The <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;aid to hear with won|der a propo&s;al to walk out, only that they may walk back; and enquire, why any man &s;hould labour for nothing: &s;o tho&s;e who&s;e condition has always re&s;trained them to the con|templation of their own nece&s;&s;ities, and who have been accu&s;tomed to look forward only to a &s;mall di&s;tance, will &s;carcely under&s;tand, why nights and days &s;hould be &s;pent in &s;tudies, which end in new &s;tudies, and which, accord|ing to <HI>Malherbe</HI>'s ob&s;ervation, do not tend to le&s;&s;en the price of bread; nor will the trader or manufacturer ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded, that much plea&s;ure can ari&s;e from the mere know|ledge
<PB N="162" REF="163">
of actions, performed in remote regi|ons, or in di&s;tant times; or that any thing can de&s;erve their enquiry, of which <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, we can only hear the report, but which cannot influence our lives by any con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that very few have lei&s;ure from indi&s;pen&s;able bu&s;ine&s;s, to employ their thoughts upon narrative or characters; and among tho&s;e to whom fortune has given the liberty of liv|ing more by their own choice, many create to them&s;elves engagements, by the indulgence of &s;ome petty ambition, the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome in&s;atiable de&s;ire, or the toleration of &s;ome predominant pa&s;&s;ion. The man who&s;e whole wi&s;h is to accumulate money, has no other care than to collect intere&s;t, to e&s;timate &s;ecu|rities, and to enquire for mortgages: the lo|ver di&s;dains to turn his ear to any other name than that of <HI>Corinna</HI>; and the courtier thinks the hour lo&s;t, which is not &s;pent in promoting his intere&s;t, and facilitating his advancement. The adventures of valour, and the di&s;coveries of &s;cience, will find a cold reception, when they are obtruded upon an attention, thus
<PB N="163" REF="164">
bu&s;y with its favourite amu&s;ement, and im|patent of interruption or di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>BUT not only &s;uch employments as &s;educe attention by the appearance of dignity, or the promi&s;e of happine&s;s, may re&s;train the mind from excur&s;ion and enquiry; curio&s;ity may be equally de&s;troyed by le&s;s formidable enemies; it may be di&s;&s;ipated in trifles, or congealed by indolence. The &s;port&s;men and the men of dre&s;s have their heads filled with a fox or a hor&s;e-race, a feather or a ball; and live in ig|norance of every thing be&s;ide, with as much content as he that heaps up gold, or &s;olicits preferment, digs the field, or beats the anvil; and &s;ome dream out their days without plea|&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, without joy or &s;orrow, nor ever rou&s;e from their lethargy to hear or think.</P>
<P>EVEN of tho&s;e who have dedicated them|&s;elves to knowledge, the far greater part have confined their curio&s;ity to a few objects, and have very little inclination to promote any fame, but that of which their own &s;tudies entitle them to partake. The naturali&s;t has no de&s;ire to know the opinions or conjectures
<PB N="164" REF="165">
of the philologer: the botani&s;t looks upon the a&s;tronomer, as a being unworthy of his regard: the lawyer &s;carcely hears the name of a phy|&s;ician without contempt; and he that is growing great and happy by electrifying a bottle, wonders how the world can be engaged by trifling prattle about war or peace.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, he that imagines the world filled with his actions and prai&s;es, &s;hall &s;ub|duct from the number of his encomia&s;ts, all tho&s;e who are placed below the flight of fame, and who hear in the vallies of life no other voice than that of nece&s;&s;ity; all tho&s;e who imagine them&s;elves too important to regard him, and con&s;ider the mention of his name, as an u&s;ur|pation of their time; all who are too much, or too little, plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, to at|tend to any thing external; all who are at|tracted by plea&s;ure, or chained down by pain, to unvaried ideas; all who are with-held from attending his triumph by different per&s;uits; and all who &s;lumber in univer&s;al negligence; he will find his renown &s;treightened by nearer bounds than the rocks of <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and per|ceive that no man can be venerable or for|midable,

<P>AS, notwith&s;tanding all that wit, or ma|lice, or pride, or prudence, will be able to &s;ugge&s;t, men and women mu&s;t at la&s;t pa&s;s their lives together, I have never been able to

think tho&s;e writers friends to human happi|ne&s;s, who endeavour to excite in either &s;ex a general contempt or &s;u&s;picion of the other. To per&s;uade them who are entering the world, and looking abroad for a &s;uitable a&s;&s;o|ciate, that all are equally vicious, or equally ridi|culous; that they who tru&s;t are certainly be|trayed, and they who e&s;teem are always di&s;|appointed; is not to awaken judgment, but to inflame temerity. Without hope there can be no caution. Tho&s;e who are convinced, that no rea&s;on for preference can be found, will never hara&s;s their thoughts with doubt and deliberation; they will re&s;olve, &s;ince they are doomed to mi&s;ery, that no needle&s;s anxiety &s;hall di&s;turb their quiet; they will plunge at hazard into the croud, and &s;natch the fir&s;t hand that &s;hall be held toward them.</P>
<P>THAT the world is over-run with vice, cannot be denied; but vice, however predo|minant, has not yet gained an unlimited do|minion. Simple and unmingled good is not in our power, but we may generally e&s;cape a greater evil by &s;uffering a le&s;s; and therefore, tho&s;e who undertake to initiate the young and ignorant in the knowledge of life, &s;hould
<PB N="167" REF="168">
be careful to inculcate the po&s;&s;ibility of virtue and happine&s;s, and to encourage endeavours by pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>YOU perhaps do not &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e are the &s;entiments of one who has been &s;ubject for many years to all the hard&s;hips of antiquated virginity; has been long accu&s;tomed to the coldne&s;s of neglect, and the petulance of in|&s;ult; has been mortified in full a&s;&s;emblies by enquiries after forgotten fa&s;hions, games long di&s;u&s;ed, and wits and beauties of ancient re|nown; has been invited, with malicious im|portunity, to the &s;econd wedding of many ac|quaintances; has been ridiculed by two gene|rations of coquets in whi&s;pers intended to be heard; and been long con&s;idered by the airy and gay, as too venerable for familiarity, and too wi&s;e for plea&s;ure. It is indeed natural for injury to provoke anger, and by continual re|petition to produce an habitual a&s;perity; yet I have hitherto &s;truggled with &s;o much vigi|lance again&s;t my pride, and my re&s;entment, that I have pre&s;erved my temper uncorrupted. I have not yet made it any part of my employ|ment to collect &s;entences again&s;t marriage; nor am inclined to le&s;&s;en the number of the
<PB N="168" REF="169">
few friends whom time has left me, by ob&s;tructing that happine&s;s which I cannot partake, and venting my vexation in cen&s;ures of the forwardne&s;s and indi&s;cretion of girls, or the incon&s;tancy, ta&s;tele&s;ne&s;s, and perfidy of men.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, not very difficult to bear that condition to which we are not condemned by nece&s;&s;ity, but induced by ob&s;ervation and choice; and therefore I, perhaps, have never yet felt all the malignity with which a re|proach edged with the appellation of old maid &s;wells &s;ome of tho&s;e hearts in which it is in|fixed. I was not condemned in my youth to &s;olitude, either by indigence or deformity, nor pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of life without the flattery of court&s;hip, and the joys of triumph. I have danced the round of gaiety amid&s;t the murmurs of envy, and gratulations of applau&s;e; been attended from plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure by the great, the &s;prightly, and the vain; and &s;een my regard &s;olicited by the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of gallantry, the gaiety of wit, and the timi|dity of love. If, therefore, I am yet a &s;tran|ger to nuptial happine&s;s, I &s;uffer only the con&s;equences of my own re&s;olves, and can
<PB N="169" REF="170">
look back upon the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lovers who&s;e addre&s;&s;es I have rejected, without grief and without malice.</P>
<P>WHEN my name fir&s;t began to be in&s;cribed upon gla&s;&s;es, I was honoured with the amo|rous profe&s;&s;ions of the gay <HI>Venu&s;tulus,</HI> a gentle|man, who, being the only &s;on of a wealthy family, had been educated in all the wanton|ne&s;s of expence, and &s;oftne&s;s of effeminacy. He was beautiful in his per&s;on, and ea&s;y in his addre&s;s, and, therefore, &s;oon gained upon my eye at an age when the &s;ight is very little over-ruled by the under&s;tanding. He had not any power in him&s;elf of gladdening or amu&s;ing; but &s;upplied his want of conver&s;ation by treats and diver&s;ions; and his chief art of court&s;hip was to fill the mind of his mi&s;tre&s;s with par|ties, rambles, mu&s;ick, and &s;hews. We were often engaged in &s;hort excur&s;ions to gardens and &s;eats, and I was for a while plea&s;ed with the care which <HI>Venu&s;tulus</HI> di&s;covered in &s;ecu|ring me from any appearance of danger or po&s;|&s;ibility of mi&s;chance. He never failed to re|commend caution to his coachman, or to pro|mi&s;e the waterman a reward if he landed us &s;afe; and always contrived to return by day|light
<PB N="170" REF="171">
for fear of robbers. This extraordinary &s;olicitude was repre&s;ented for a time as the ef|fect of his tenderne&s;s for me, but fear is too &s;trong for continued hypocri&s;y. I &s;oon di&s;co|vered, that <HI>Venu&s;tulus</HI> had the cowardice as well as elegance of a female. His imagi|nation was perpetually clouded with terrors, and he could &s;carcely refrain from &s;creams and outcries at any accidental &s;urprize. He dur&s;t not enter a room if a rat was heard behind the wain&s;coat, nor cro&s;s a field where the cattle were fri&s;king in the &s;un&s;hine; the lea&s;t breeze that waved upon the river was a &s;torm, and every clamour in the &s;treet was a cry of fire. I have &s;een him lo&s;e his colour when my &s;quirrel had broke his chain; and was forced to throw water in his face on the &s;udden entrance of a black cat. Compa&s;&s;ion once obliged me to drive away with my fan, a beetle that kept him in di&s;tre&s;s, and chide off a dog that yelped at his heels, to which he would gladly have given up me to facilitate his own e&s;cape. Women naturally expect de|fence and protection from a lover or a hu&s;|band, and therefore you will not think me culpable in refu&s;ing a wretch, who would have burdened life with unnece&s;&s;ary fears,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
and flown to me for that &s;uccour which it was his duty to have given.</P>
<P>MY next lover was <HI>Fungo&s;o,</HI> the &s;on of a &s;tockjobber, who&s;e vi&s;its my friends, by the importunity of per&s;ua&s;ion, prevailed upon me to allow. <HI>Fungo&s;o</HI> was no very &s;uitable com|panion; for, having been bred in a counting|hou&s;e, he &s;poke a language unintelligible in any other place. He had no de&s;ire of any reputation, but that of an acute progno&s;tica|tor of the changes in the funds; nor had any means of rai&s;ing merriment, but by telling how &s;omebody was over-reached in a bargain by his father. He was, however, a youth of great &s;obriety and prudence, and frequently inform|ed us how carefully he would improve my fortune. I was not in ha&s;te to conclude the match, but was &s;o much awed by my parents, that I dur&s;t not di&s;mi&s;s him, and might, per|haps, have been doomed for ever to the gro&s;|ne&s;s of pedlary, and the jargon of u&s;ury, had not a fraud been di&s;covered in the &s;ettlement, which &s;et me free from the per&s;ecution of groveling pride, and pecuniary impudence.</P>
<P>I WAS afterwards &s;ix months without any
<PB N="172" REF="173">
particular notice, but at la&s;t became the idol of the glittering <HI>Flo&s;culus,</HI> who pre&s;cribed the mode of embroidery to all the fops of his time, and varied at plea&s;ure the cock of every hat, and the &s;leeve of every coat, that appeared in fa&s;hionable a&s;&s;emblies. <HI>Flo&s;culus</HI> made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon my heart by a compliment which few ladies can hear without emotion; he commended my &s;kill in dre&s;s, my judg|ment in &s;uiting colours, and my art in di&s;po|&s;ing ornaments. But <HI>Flo&s;culus</HI> was too much engaged by his own elegance, to be &s;ufficient|ly attentive to the duties of a lover, or to plea&s;e with varied prai&s;e an ear made delicate by riot of adulation. He expected to be re|paid part of his tribute, and &s;taid away three days, becau&s;e I neglected to take notice of a new coat. I quickly found, that <HI>Flo&s;culus</HI> was rather a rival than an admirer; and that we &s;hould probably live in a perpetual &s;truggle of emulous finery, and &s;pend our lives in &s;trata|gems to be fir&s;t in the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;oon after the honour at a fea&s;t of attracting the eyes of <HI>Dentatus,</HI> one of tho&s;e human beings who&s;e only happine&s;s is to dine. <HI>Dentatus</HI> regaled me with foreign varieties,
<PB N="173" REF="174">
told me of mea&s;ures that he had laid for pro|curing the be&s;t cook in <HI>France,</HI> and entertain|ed me with bills of fare, pre&s;cribed the ar|rangement of di&s;hes, and taught me two &s;aw|ces invented by him&s;elf. At length, &s;uch is the uncertainty of human happine&s;s, I declared my opinion too ha&s;tily upon a pie made under his own direction; after which he grew &s;o cold and negligent, that he was ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed.</P>
<P>MANY other lovers, or pretended lovers, I have had the honour to lead a while in triumph. But two of them I drove from me by di&s;co|vering, that they had no ta&s;te or knowledge in mu&s;ick; three I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e they were drunkards; two, becau&s;e they paid their addre&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time to other ladies; and &s;ix, becau&s;e they attempted to influence my choice, by bribing my maid. Two more I di&s;carded at the &s;econd vi&s;it, for ob&s;cene al|lu&s;ions; and five for drollery on religion. In the latter part of my reign, I &s;entenced two to perpetual exile, for offering me &s;ettle|ments, by which the children of a former marriage would have been injured; four, for repre&s;enting fal&s;ly the value of their e&s;tates;
<PB N="174" REF="175">
three, for concealing their debts; and one, for rai&s;ing the rent of a decrepit tenant.</P>
<P>I have now &s;ent you a narrative, which the ladies may oppo&s;e to the tale of <HI>Hymenaeus.</HI> I mean not to depreciate the &s;ex, which has produced poets and philo&s;ophers, heroes and martyrs; but will not &s;uffer the ri&s;ing gene|ration of beauties to be dejected by partial &s;atire; or to imagine, that tho&s;e who cen&s;ure them, have not likewi&s;e their follies, and their vices. I do not yet believe happine&s;s unattainable in marriage though I have never yet been able to find a man, with whom I could prudently venture an in&s;epara|ble union. It is nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e faults, that their deformity may be &s;een; but the reproach ought not to be extended beyond the crime, nor either &s;ex to be condemned, be|cau&s;e &s;ome women, or men, are indelicate, or di&s;hone&s;t.</P>

<P>IN the reign of <HI>Jenghiz Can,</HI> conqueror of the ea&s;t, in the city of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> lived <HI>Nouradin</HI> the merchant, renowned through|out all the regions of <HI>India</HI> for the extent of his commerce, and the integrity of his deal|ings. His warehou&s;es were filled with all the commodities of the remote&s;t nations; every rarity of nature, every curio&s;ity of art, whatever was valuable, whatever was u&s;eful, ha&s;ted to his hand. The &s;treets were croud|ed with his carriages; the &s;ea was covered with his &s;hips; the &s;treams of <HI>Oxus</HI> were wearied with conveyance, and every breeze of the &s;ky wa&s;ted wealth to <HI>Nouradin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177">
AT length <HI>Nouradin</HI> felt him&s;elf &s;eized with a &s;low malady, which he fir&s;t endeavour|ed to divert by application, and afterwards to relieve by luxury and indulgence; but finding his &s;trength every day le&s;s, he was at la&s;t ter|rified, and called for help upon the &s;ages of phy&s;ick; they filled his apartments with alexipharmicks, re&s;toratives, and e&s;&s;ential vir|tues; the pearls of the ocean were di&s;&s;olved, the &s;pices of <HI>Arabia</HI> were di&s;tilled, and all the powers of nature were employed, to give new &s;pirits to his nerves, and new bal&s;am to his blood. <HI>Nouradin</HI> was for &s;ome time amu&s;ed with promi&s;es, invigorated with cordials, or &s;oothed with anodynes; but the di&s;ea&s;e prey|ed upon his vitals, and he &s;oon di&s;covered with indignation, that health was not to be bought. He was confined to his chamber, de&s;erted by his phy&s;icians, and rarely vi&s;ited by his friends; but his unwillingne&s;s to die flattered him long with hopes of life.</P>
<P>AT length, having pa&s;&s;ed the night in te|dious languor, he called to him <HI>Almamoulin,</HI> his only &s;on; and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his attendants, "My &s;on," &s;ays he, "behold here the
<PB N="177" REF="178">
weakne&s;s and fragility of man; look back|ward a few days, thy father was great and happy, fre&s;h as the vernal ro&s;e, and &s;trong as the cedar of the mountain; the nations of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> drank his dews, and art and com|merce delighted in his &s;hade. Malevolence beheld me, and &s;ighed: His root, &s;he cried, is fixed in the depths; it is watered by the fountains of <HI>Oxus</HI>; it &s;ends out branches afar, and bids defiance to the bla&s;t; pru|dence reclines again&s;t his trunk, and pro|&s;perity dances on his top. Now, <HI>Almamou|lin,</HI> look upon me withering and pro&s;trate; look upon me, and attend. I have traffick|ed, I have pro&s;pered, I have rioted in gain; my hou&s;e is &s;plendid, my &s;ervants are nu|merous; yet I di&s;played only a &s;mall part of my riches; the re&s;t, which I was hin|dered from enjoying by the fear of rai&s;ing envy, or tempting rapacity, I have piled in towers, I have buried in caverns, I have hidden in &s;ecret repo&s;itories, which this &s;croll will di&s;cover. My purpo&s;e was, af|ter ten months more &s;pent in commerce, to have withdrawn my wealth to a &s;afer country; to have given &s;even years to de|light and fe&s;tivity, and the remaining part
<PB N="178" REF="179">
of my days to &s;olitude and repentance; but the hand of death is upon me; a frigori|fick torpor encroaches upon my veins; I am now leaving the produce of my toil, which it mu&s;t be thy bu&s;ine&s;s to enjoy with wi&s;|dom." The thought of leaving his wealth filled <HI>Nouradin</HI> with &s;uch grief, that he fell into convul&s;ions, became delirious, and ex|pired.</P>
<P>ALMAMOULIN, who loved his father, was touched a while with hone&s;t &s;orrow, and &s;at two hours in profound meditation, without peru&s;ing the paper which he held in his hand. He then retired to his own chamber, as over|born with affliction, and there read the in|ventory of his new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which &s;welled his heart with &s;uch tran&s;ports, that he no lon|ger lamented his father's death. He was now &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to order a funeral of mode&s;t magnificence, &s;uitable at once to the rank of <HI>Nouradin</HI>'s profe&s;&s;ion, and the reputa|tion of his wealth. The two next nights he &s;pent in vi&s;iting the tower and the caverns, and found the trea&s;ures greater to his eye than to his imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="180">
ALMAMOULIN had been bred to the prac|tice of exact frugality, and had often looked with envy on the finery and expences of other young men: he therefore believed, that hap|pine&s;s was now in his power, &s;ince he could obtain all of which he had hitherto been ac|cu&s;tomed to regret the want. He re&s;olved to give a loo&s;e to his de&s;ires, to revel in enjoy|ment, and feel pain or unea&s;ine&s;s no more.</P>
<P>HE immediately procured a &s;plendid equi|page, dre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants in rich embroidery, and covered his hor&s;es with golden capari&s;ons. He &s;howered down &s;ilver on the populace, and &s;uffered their acclamations to &s;well him with in&s;olence. The nobles &s;aw him with anger, the wi&s;e men of the &s;tate combined again&s;t him, the leaders of armies threatened his de&s;truc|tion. <HI>Almamoulin</HI> was informed of his danger: he put on the robe of mourning in the pre|&s;ence of his enemies, and appea&s;ed them with gold, and gems, and &s;upplication.</P>
<P>HE then &s;ought to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, by an alliance with the princes of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and offered the price of kingdoms, for a wife of
<PB N="180" REF="181">
noble birth. His &s;uit was generally rejected, and his pre&s;ents refu&s;ed; but a prince&s;s of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> once conde&s;cended to admit him to her pre&s;ence. She received him &s;itting on a throne, attired in the robe of royalty, and &s;hining with the jewels of <HI>Golconda</HI>; com|mand &s;parkled in her eyes, and dignity tow|ered on her forehead. <HI>Almamoulin</HI> approach|ed and trembled. She &s;aw his confu&s;ion, and di&s;dained him: How, &s;ays &s;he, dares the wretch hope my obedience, who thus &s;hrinks at my glance? Retire, and enjoy thy riches in forbid o&s;tentation; thou wa&s;t born to be wealthy, but never can&s;t be great.</P>
<P>HE then contracted his de&s;ires to more pri|vate and dome&s;tick plea&s;ures. He built pa|laces, he laid out gardens, he changed the face of the land, he tran&s;planted fore&s;ts, he levelled mountains, opened pro&s;pects into di&s;tant re|gions, poured fountains from the tops of tur|rets, and rolled rivers through new chanels.</P>
<P>THESE amu&s;ements plea&s;ed him for a time; but languor and wearine&s;s &s;oon invaded him. His bowers lo&s;t their fragrance, and the waters murmured without notice. He purcha&s;ed
<PB N="181" REF="182">
large tracts of land in di&s;tant provinces, adorn|ed them with hou&s;es of plea&s;ure, and diver&s;i|fied them with accommodations for different &s;ea&s;ons. Change of place at fir&s;t relieved his &s;atiety, but all the novelties of &s;ituation were &s;oon exhau&s;ted; he found his heart vacant, and his de&s;ires, for want of external objects, ravaging him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HE therefore returned to <HI>Samarcand,</HI> and &s;et open his doors to tho&s;e whom idlene&s;s &s;ends out in &s;earch of plea&s;ure. His tables were always covered with delicacies; wines of every vintage &s;parkled in his bowls, and his lamps &s;cattered perfumes. The &s;ound of the lute, and the voice of the &s;inger, cha&s;ed away &s;adne&s;s; every hour was crouded with plea&s;ure; and the day ended and began with fea&s;ts and dances, and revelry and merriment. <HI>Almamoulin</HI> cried out, "I have at la&s;t found the u&s;e of riches; I am &s;urrounded by com|panions, who view my greatne&s;s without envy; and I enjoy at once the raptures of popularity, and the &s;afety of an ob&s;cure &s;tation. What trouble can he feel, whom all are &s;tudious to plea&s;e, that they may be
<PB N="182" REF="183">
repaid with plea&s;ure? What danger can he dread, to whom every man is a friend?"</P>
<P>SUCH were the thoughts of <HI>Almamoulin,</HI> as he looked down from a gallery upon the gay a&s;&s;embly, regaling at his expence; but in the mid&s;t of this &s;oliloquy, an officer of ju&s;tice en|tered the hou&s;e, and, in the form of legal cita|tion, &s;ummoned <HI>Almamoulin</HI> to appear before the emperor. The gue&s;ts &s;tood a while agha&s;t, then &s;tole imperceptible away, and he was led off without a &s;ingle voice to witne&s;s his inte|grity. He now found one of his mo&s;t fre|quent vi&s;itants, accu&s;ing him of trea&s;on in hopes of &s;haring his confi&s;cation; yet, unpa|tronized and un&s;upported, he cleared him&s;elf by the openne&s;s of innocence, and the con&s;i&s;t|ence of truth; he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with ho|nour, and his accu&s;er peri&s;hed in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>ALMAMOULIN now perceived with how little rea&s;on he had hoped for ju&s;tice or fidelity from tho&s;e who live only to gratify their &s;en|&s;es; and, being now weary with vain experi|ments upon life and fruitle&s;s &s;earches after felicity, he had recour&s;e to a &s;age, who, af|ter &s;pending his youth in travel and ob&s;erva|tion,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
had retired from all human cares, to a &s;mall habitation on the banks of <HI>Oxus,</HI> where he conver&s;ed only with &s;uch as &s;olicit|ed his coun&s;el. "Brother," &s;aid the philo|&s;opher, "thou ha&s;t &s;uffered thy rea&s;on to be deluded by idle hopes, and fallacious ap|pearances. Having long looked with de&s;ire upon riches, thou had&s;t taught thy&s;elf to think them more valuable than nature de|&s;igned them, and to expect from them, what experience has now taught thee, that they cannot give. That they do not con|fer wi&s;dom, thou may&s;t be convinced, by con&s;idering at how dear a price they tempt|ed thee, upon thy fir&s;t entrance into the world, to purcha&s;e the empty &s;ound of vul|gar acclamation. That they cannot be|&s;tow fortitude or magnanimity, that man may be certain, who &s;tood trembling at <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> before a being not naturally &s;u|perior to him&s;elf. That they will not &s;up|ply unexhau&s;ted plea&s;ure, the recollection of for&s;aken palaces, and neglected gardens, will ea&s;ily inform thee. That they rarely purcha&s;e friends, thou did&s;t &s;oon di&s;cover, when thou wert left to &s;tand thy tryal un|countenanced and alone. Yet think not
<PB N="184" REF="185">
riches u&s;ele&s;s; there are purpo&s;es, to which a wi&s;e man may be delighted to apply them; they may, by a rational di&s;tribution to tho&s;e who want them, ea&s;e the pains of helple&s;s di&s;ea&s;e, &s;till the throbs of re&s;tle&s;s anxiety, relieve innocence from oppre&s;&s;ion, and rai&s;e imbecillity to chearfulne&s;s and vi|gour. This they will enable thee to per|form, and this will afford the only happi|ne&s;s ordained for our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the confidence of divine favour, and the hope of future rewards."</P>

<P>I Have been informed by a letter, from one of the univer&s;ities, that among the youth from whom the next &s;warm of rea&s;oners is to learn philo&s;ophy, and the next flight of beau|ties to hear elegies and &s;onnets, there are many, who, in&s;tead of endeavouring by books and meditation to form their own opinions, con|tent them&s;elves with the &s;econdary know|ledge, which a convenient bench in a coffee|hou&s;e can &s;upply; and, without any examina|tion or di&s;tinction, adopt the critici&s;ms and remarks, which happen to drop from tho&s;e, who have ri&s;en, by merit or fortune, to repu|tation and authority.</P>
<P>THESE humble retailers of knowledge my corre&s;pondent &s;tigmatizes with the name of <HI>Echoes</HI>; and &s;eems de&s;irous, that they &s;hould
<PB N="186" REF="187">
be made a&s;hamed of lazy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and ani|mated to attempts after new di&s;coveries, and original &s;entiments.</P>
<P>IT is very natural for young men to be vehement, acrimonious, and &s;evere. For, as they &s;eldom comprehend at once all the con&s;equences of a po&s;ition, or perceive the difficulties by which cooler and more ex|perienced rea&s;oners are re&s;trained from confi|dence, they form their conclu&s;ions with great precipitance; as they &s;ee nothing that can darken or embarra&s;s the que&s;tion, they expect to find their own opinion univer&s;ally preva|lent, and are inclined to impute uncertainty and he&s;itation to want of hone&s;ty, rather than of knowledge. I may, perhaps, therefore be reproached by my lively corre&s;pondent, when it &s;hall be found, that I have no inclination to per&s;ecute the&s;e collectors of fortuitous knowledge with the &s;everity required; yet, as I am now too old to be much terrified or pained by ha&s;ty cen&s;ure, I &s;hall not be afraid of taking into protection tho&s;e whom I think condemned without a &s;ufficient knowledge of their cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">
HE that adopts the &s;entiments of another, whom he has rea&s;on to believe wi&s;er than him|&s;elf, is only to be blamed, when he claims the honours which are not due but to the author, and endeavours to deceive the world into prai&s;e and veneration. For, to learn, is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of youth; and whether we encrea&s;e our knowledge by books, or by conver&s;ation, we are equally indebted to fo|reign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE greater part of &s;tudents are not born with abilities, to con&s;truct &s;y&s;tems, or advance knowledge; nor can have any hope beyond that of becoming intelligent hearers in the &s;chools of art, of being able to comprehend what others di&s;cover, and to remember what others teach. Even tho&s;e to whom Provi|dence has allotted greater &s;trength of under|&s;tanding, can expect only to improve a &s;ingle &s;cience. In every other part of learn|ing, they mu&s;t be content to follow opinions, which they are not able to examine; and, even in that which they claim as peculiarly their own, can &s;eldom add more than &s;ome &s;mall particle of knowledge, to the hereditary
<PB N="188" REF="189">
&s;tock devolved to them from ancient times, the collective labour of a thou&s;and intel|lects.</P>
<P>IN &s;cience, which being fixed and limited, admits of no other variety than &s;uch as ari&s;es from new methods of di&s;tribution, or new arts of illu&s;tration, the nece&s;&s;ity of following the traces of our predece&s;&s;ors is indi&s;putably evi|dent; but there appears no rea&s;on, why ima|gination &s;hould be &s;ubject to the &s;ame re|&s;traint. It might be conceived, that of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to for&s;ake the narrow paths of truth every one may deviate towards a dif|ferent point, &s;ince though rectitude is uni|form and fixed, obliquity may be infinitely diver&s;ified. The fields of &s;cience are narrow, &s;o that they who travel them, mu&s;t either follow or meet one another; but in the boundle&s;s regions of po&s;&s;ibility, which fiction claims for her dominion, there are &s;urely a thou&s;and rece&s;&s;es unexplored, a thou&s;and flowers unplucked, a thou&s;and fountains unex|hau&s;ted, combinations of imagery yet unob|&s;erved, and races of ideal inhabitants not hi|therto de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">
YET, whatever hope may per&s;uade, or rea|&s;on evince, experience can boa&s;t of very few additions to ancient fable. The wars of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the travels of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> have furni&s;hed almo&s;t all &s;ucceeding poets with incidents, chara|cters, and &s;entiments. The <HI>Romans</HI> are con|fe&s;&s;ed to have attempted little more than to di&s;play in their own tongue the inventions of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> There is, in all their writings, &s;uch a perpetual recurrence of allu&s;ions to the tales of the fabulous age, that they mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed often to want that power of giving plea&s;ure which novelty &s;upplies; nor can we wonder, that they excelled &s;o much in the graces of diction, when we con&s;ider how rarely they were employed in &s;earch of new thoughts.</P>
<P>THE warme&s;t admirers of the great <HI>Man|tuan</HI> poet can extol him for little more than the &s;kill with which he has, by making his hero both a traveller and a warrior, united the beauties of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> in one com|po&s;ition: yet his judgment was perhaps &s;ome|times overborn by his avarice of the <HI>Homeric</HI> trea&s;ures; and, for fear of &s;uffering a &s;parkling
<PB N="190" REF="191">
ornament to be lo&s;t, he has in&s;erted it where it cannot &s;hine with its original &s;plendor.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> vi&s;ited the infernal regions, he found, that among the heroes that peri&s;hed at <HI>Troy,</HI> his competitor <HI>Ajax,</HI> who, when the arms of <HI>Achilles</HI> were adjudged to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> died by his own hand in the madne&s;s of di&s;appointment. He &s;till appeared to re&s;ent, as on earth, his lo&s;s and di&s;grace. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> endeavoured to pa|cify him with prai&s;es and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but <HI>Ajax</HI> walked away without reply. This pa&s;|&s;age has always been con&s;idered as eminently beautiful; becau&s;e <HI>Ajax</HI> the haughty chief, the unlettered &s;oldier, of un&s;haken courage, of immoveable con&s;tancy, but without the power of recommending his own virtues by eloquence, or enforcing his a&s;&s;ertions by any other argument than the &s;word, had no way of making his anger known, but by gloomy &s;ullenne&s;s, and dumb ferocity. His hatred of a man whom he conceived to have de|feated him only by volubility of tongue, was therefore naturally &s;hewn by &s;ilence more con|temptuous and piercing than any words that &s;o rude an orator could have found, and by which
<PB N="191" REF="192">
he gave his enemy no opportunity of exerting the only power in which he was &s;uperior.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Aeneas</HI> is &s;ent by <HI>Virgil</HI> to vi&s;it the &s;hades, he meets with <HI>Dido</HI> the queen of <HI>Carthage</HI> whom his perfidy had hurried to the grave; he acco&s;ts her with tenderne&s;s and excu&s;es; but the lady turns away like <HI>Ajax</HI> in mute di&s;dain. She turns away like <HI>Ajax,</HI> but &s;he re&s;embles him in none of tho&s;e quali|ties, which give either dignity or propriety to &s;ilence. She might, without any departure from the tenour of her conduct, have bur&s;t out like other injured women into clamour, reproach, and denunciation; but <HI>Virgil</HI> had his imagination full of <HI>Ajax,</HI> and therefore could not prevail on him&s;elf to teach <HI>Dido</HI> any other mode of re&s;entment.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Virgil</HI> could be thus &s;educed by imita|tion, there will be little hope, that common wits &s;hould e&s;cape; and accordingly we find, that be&s;ides the univer&s;al and acknowledged practice of copying the ancients, there has prevailed in every age a particular &s;pecies of fiction. At one time all truth was conveyed in allegory; at another, nothing was &s;een but
<PB N="192" REF="193">
in a vi&s;ion; at one period, all the poets fol|lowed &s;heep, and every event produced a pa&s;|toral; at another they bu&s;ied them&s;elves wholly in giving directions to a painter.</P>
<P>IT is indeed ea&s;y to conceive why any fa|&s;hion &s;hould become popular, by which idle|ne&s;s is favoured, and imbecillity a&s;&s;i&s;ted; but &s;urely no man of genius can much applaud him&s;elf for repeating a tale with which the audience is already tired, and which could bring no honour to any but its inventor.</P>
<P>THERE are, I think, two &s;chemes of writing, on which the laborious wits of the pre&s;ent time employ their faculties. One is the adaptation of &s;en&s;e to all the rhymes which our language can &s;upply to &s;ome word, that makes the burden of the &s;tanza; but this, as it has been only u&s;ed in a kind of amorous burle&s;que, can &s;carcely be cen&s;ured with much acrimony. The other is the imitation of <HI>Spen|&s;er,</HI> which, by the influence of &s;ome men of learning and genius, &s;eems likely to gain upon the age, and therefore de&s;erves to be more attentively con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
TO imitate the fictions and &s;entiments of <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> can incur no reproach, for allegory is perhaps one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing vehicles of in&s;truction. But I am very far from extend|ing the &s;ame re&s;pect to his diction or his &s;tanza. His &s;tile was in his own time al|lowed to be vicious, &s;o darkened with old words and peculiarities of phra&s;e, and &s;o re|mote from common u&s;e, that <HI>John&s;on</HI> boldly pronounces him to have written no language. His &s;tanza is at once difficult and unplea&s;ing; tire&s;ome to the ear by its uniformity, and to the attention by its length. It was at fir&s;t form|ed in imitation of the <HI>Italian</HI> poets, without due regard to the genius of our language. The <HI>Italians</HI> have &s;o little variety of termination, that they were forced to contrive &s;uch a &s;tanza as might admit the greate&s;t number of &s;imilar rhymes; but our words end with &s;o much diver&s;ity, that it is &s;eldom convenient for us to bring more than two of the &s;ame &s;ound together. If it be ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by <HI>Milton,</HI> that rhyme obliges poets to expre&s;s their thoughts in improper terms, the&s;e im|proprieties mu&s;t always be multiplied, as the
<PB N="194" REF="195">
difficulty of rhyme is encrea&s;ed by long con|catenations.</P>
<P>THE imitators of <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> are indeed not very rigid cen&s;ors of them&s;elves, for they &s;eem to conclude, that when they have di&s;|figured their lines with a few ob&s;olete &s;yllables, they have accompli&s;hed their de&s;ign, without con&s;idering that they ought not only to admit words, but to avoid new. The laws of imi|tation are broken by every word introduced &s;ince the time of <HI>Spen&s;er,</HI> as the character of <HI>Hector</HI> is violated by quoting <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in the play. It would indeed be difficult to exclude from a long poem all modern phra&s;es, though it is ea&s;y to &s;prinkle it with gleanings of an|tiquity. Perhaps, however, the &s;tile of <HI>Spen|&s;er</HI> might by long labour be ju&s;tly copied; but life is &s;urely given us for higher purpo&s;es than to gather what our ance&s;tors have wi&s;ely thrown away, and to learn what is of no va|lue, but becau&s;e it has been forgotten.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more &s;ubject to mi&s;take and di&s;appointment than an|ticipated judgment concerning the ea&s;ine&s;s or difficulty of any undertaking, whether we form our opinion from the performances of others, or from ab&s;tracted contemplation of the thing to be attempted.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is done &s;kilfully appears to be done with ea&s;e; and art, when it is once matured to habit, vani&s;hes from ob&s;ervation. We are therefore more powerfully excited to emulation, by tho&s;e who have attained the highe&s;t degree of excellence, and whom we can therefore with lea&s;t rea&s;on hope to equal.</P>
<P>IN adju&s;ting the probability of &s;ucce&s;s by a previous con&s;ideration of the undertaking, we
<PB N="196" REF="197">
are equally in danger of deceiving our&s;elves. It is never ea&s;y, nor often po&s;&s;ible, to com|pri&s;e the &s;eries of any proce&s;s, with all its cir|cum&s;tances, incidents, and variations, in a &s;peculative &s;cheme. Experience &s;oon &s;hews us the tortuo&s;ities of imaginary rectitude, the complications of &s;implicity, and the a&s;|perities of &s;moothne&s;s. Sudden difficulties often &s;tart up from the ambu&s;hes of art, &s;top the career of activity, repre&s;s the gaiety of confidence, and when we imagine our&s;elves almo&s;t at the end of our labours, drive us back to new plans and different mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THERE are many things which we every day &s;ee others unable to perform, and perhaps have even our&s;elves mi&s;|carried in attempting; and yet can hardly allow to be difficult; nor can we forbear to wonder afre&s;h at every new failure, or to promi&s;e certainty of &s;ucce&s;s to our next e&s;&s;ay; but when we try, the &s;ame hindrances recur, the &s;ame inability is perceived, and the vexa|tion of di&s;appointment mu&s;t again be &s;uffered.</P>
<P>OF the various kinds of &s;peaking or wri|ting, which &s;erve nece&s;&s;ity, or promote plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="197" REF="198">
none appears &s;o artle&s;s or ea&s;y as &s;imple narration; for what &s;hould make him that knows the whole order and progre&s;s of an af|fair unable to relate it? Yet we hourly find &s;uch as endeavour to entertain or in&s;truct us by recitals, clouding the facts which they in|tend to illu&s;trate, and lo&s;ing them&s;elves and their auditors in wilds and mazes, in digre&s;|&s;ion and confu&s;ion. When we have con|gratulated our&s;elves upon a new opportunity of enquiry, and new means of information; it often happens, that without de&s;igning either deceit or concealment, without ignorance of the fact, or unwillingne&s;s to di&s;clo&s;e it, the relator fills the ear with empty &s;ounds, ha|ra&s;&s;es the attention with fruitle&s;s impatience, and di&s;turbs the imagination by a tumult of events, without order of time, or train of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IT is natural to believe upon the &s;ame principle, that no writer has a more ea&s;y ta&s;k than the hi&s;torian. The philo&s;opher has the works of omni&s;cience to examine; and is therefore engaged in di&s;qui&s;itions, to which finite intellects are utterly unequal. The poet tru&s;ts to his invention, and is not only in
<PB N="198" REF="199">
danger of tho&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, to which every one is expo&s;ed by departure from truth; but may be cen&s;ured as well for defici|cencies of matter, as for irregularity of di&s;|po&s;ition, or impropriety of ornament. But the happy hi&s;torian has no other labour than of gathering what tradition pours down before him, or records trea&s;ure for his u&s;e. He has only the actions and de&s;igns of men like him|&s;elf to conceive and to relate; he is not to form, but copy characters, and therefore is not blamed for the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;tate&s;men, the inju&s;tice of tyrants, or the cowardice of commanders. The difficulty of making va|riety con&s;i&s;tent, or uniting probability with &s;urprize, needs not to di&s;trub him; the man|ners and actions of his per&s;onages are already fixed; his materials are provided and put into his hands, and he is at lei&s;ure to employ all his powers in arranging and di&s;playing them.</P>
<P>YET, even with the&s;e advantages, very few in any age have been able to rai&s;e them&s;elves to reputation by writing hi&s;tories; and among the innumerable authors, who fill every na|tion with accounts of their ance&s;tors, or un|dertake to ttan&s;mit to futurity the events of
<PB N="199" REF="200">
their own time, the greater part, when fa&s;hion and novelty have cea&s;ed to recommend them, are of no other u&s;e than chronological me|morials, which nece&s;&s;ity may &s;ometimes re|quire to be con&s;ulted, but which fright away curio&s;ity, and di&s;gu&s;t delicacy.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that our nation, which has produced &s;o many authors eminent for al|mo&s;t every other &s;pecies of literary excellence, has been hitherto remarkably barren of hi&s;to|rical genius; and &s;o far has this defect rai&s;ed prejudices again&s;t us, that &s;ome have doubted, whether an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can &s;top at that me|diocrity of &s;tile, or confine his mind to that even tenour of imagination, which narrative requires.</P>
<P>THEY who can believe that nature has &s;o capriciou&s;ly di&s;tributed under&s;tanding, have &s;urely no claim to the honour of &s;erious con&s;u|tation. The inhabitants of the &s;ame country have oppo&s;ite characters in different ages; the prevalence or neglect of any particular &s;tudy can proceed only from the accidental influence of &s;ome temporary cau&s;e; and if we have fail|ed in hi&s;tory, we can have failed only becau&s;e
<PB N="200" REF="201">
hi&s;tory has not hitherto been diligently cul|tivated.</P>
<P>BUT how is it evident, that we have not hi&s;torians among us, whom we may venture to place in compari&s;on with any that the neighbouring nations can produce? The at|tempt of <HI>Raleigh</HI> is de&s;ervedly celebrated for the labour of his re&s;earches, and the elegance of his &s;tile; but he has endeavoured to exert his judgment more than his genius, to &s;elect facts, rather than adorn them; and has produced an hi&s;torical di&s;&s;ertation, but &s;eldom ri&s;en to the maje&s;ty of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE work of <HI>Clarendon</HI> de&s;erves more re|gard. His diction is indeed neither exact in it&s;elf, nor &s;uited to the purpo&s;e of hi&s;tory. It is the effu&s;ion of a mind crouded with ideas, and de&s;irous of imparting them; and there|fore always accumulating words, and involv|ing one clau&s;e and &s;entence in another. But there is dignity in his negligence, a rude in|artificial maje&s;ty, which, without the nicety of laboured elegance, &s;wells the mind by its plenitude and diffu&s;ion. His narration is not perhaps &s;ufficiently rapid, being &s;topped
<PB N="201" REF="202">
too frequently by particularities, which, though they might &s;trike the author who was pre&s;ent at the tran&s;actions, will not equally detain the attention of po&s;terity. But his ignorance or carele&s;ne&s;s of the art of writing are amply compen&s;ated by his knowledge of nature and of policy; the wi&s;dom of his maxims, the ju&s;tne&s;s of his rea&s;onings, and the variety, di&s;tinctne&s;s, and &s;trength of his characters.</P>
<P>BUT none of our writers can, in my opi|nion, ju&s;tly conte&s;t the &s;uperiority of <HI>Knolles,</HI> who, in his hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks,</HI> has di&s;played all the excellencies that narration can admit. His &s;tile, though &s;omewhat ob&s;cured by time, and &s;ometimes vitiated by fal&s;e wit, is pure, nervous, elevated, and clear. A wonderful multiplicity of events is &s;o artfully arranged, and &s;o di&s;tinctly explained, that each facilitates the knowledge of the next. Whenever a new per&s;onage is introduced, the reader is prepa|red by his character for his actions; when a nation is fir&s;t attacked, or city be&s;ieged, he is made acquainted with its hi&s;tory, or &s;ituation; &s;o that a great part of the world is brought under his view. The de&s;criptions of this au|thor are without minutene&s;s, and the digre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="202" REF="203">
without o&s;tentation. Collateral events are &s;o artfully woven into the contexture of his principal &s;tory, that they cannot be di&s;|joined, without leaving it lacerated and bro|ken. There is nothing turgid in his dignity, nor &s;uperfluous in his copiou&s;ne&s;s. His ora|tions only, which he feigns, like the ancient hi&s;torians, to have been pronounced on re|markable occa&s;ions, are tedious and languid; and &s;ince they are merely the voluntary &s;ports of imagination, prove how much the mo&s;t ju|dicious and &s;kilful may be mi&s;taken, in the e&s;ti|mate of their own powers.</P>
<P>NOTHING could have &s;unk this author in ob&s;curity, but the remotene&s;s and barbarity of the people, who&s;e &s;tory he relates. It &s;eldom happens, that all circum&s;tances concur to hap|pine&s;s or fame. The nation, which produced this great hi&s;torian, has the grief of &s;eeing his genius employed upon a foreign and uninter|e&s;ting &s;ubject; and that writer, who might have &s;ecured perpetuity to his name, by a hi|&s;tory of his own country, has expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to the danger of oblivion, by recounting enterprizes and revolutions, of which none de&s;ire to be informed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have &s;o long found my|&s;elf deluded by projects of honour and di&s;tinction, that I often re&s;olve to admit them no more into my heart; yet how determi|nately &s;oever excluded, they always recover their dominion by force or &s;tratagem; and whenever, after the &s;horte&s;t relaxation of vi|gilance, rea&s;on and caution return to their charge, they find hope again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with all her train of plea&s;ures dancing about her.</P>
<P>EVEN while I am preparing to write a hi|&s;tory of di&s;appointed expectations; I cannot forbear to flatter my&s;elf, that you and your
<PB N="204" REF="205">
readers are impatient for my performance; and that the &s;ons of learning have laid down &s;everal of your late papers with di&s;content, when they found that <HI>Mi&s;ocapelus</HI> had delayed to continue his narrative.</P>
<P>BUT the de&s;ire of gratifying the expecta|tions that I have rai&s;ed, is not the only mo|tive of this relation, which, having once pro|mi&s;ed it, I think my&s;elf no longer at liberty to forbear. For however I may have wi&s;hed to clear my&s;elf from every other adhe&s;ion of trade, I hope I &s;hall be always wi&s;e enough to retain my punctuality, and amid&s;t all my new arts of politene&s;s, continue to de&s;pi&s;e negligence, and dete&s;t fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>WHEN the death of my brother had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed me from the duties of a &s;hop, I con&s;i|dered my&s;elf as re&s;tored to the rights of my birth, and entitled to the rank and reception, which my ance&s;tors obtained. I was, how|ever, embarra&s;&s;ed with many difficulties at my fir&s;t re-entrance into the world; for my ha&s;te to be a gentleman inclined me to pre|cipitate mea&s;ures; and every accident that forced me back towards my old &s;tation, was
<PB N="205" REF="206">
con&s;idered by me, as an ob&s;truction of my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT was no common grief and indignation, that I found my former companions &s;till da|ring to claim my notice, and the journeymen and apprentices &s;ometimes pulling me by the &s;leeve as I was walking the &s;treet; and with|out any terror of my new &s;word, which was, notwith&s;tanding, of an uncommon &s;ize, in|viting me to partake of a bottle at the old hou&s;e, and entertaining me with hi&s;tories of the girls in the neighbourhood. I had always, in my officinal &s;tate, been kept in awe by lace and embroidery; and imagined that to fright away the&s;e unwelcome familiarities, nothing was nece&s;&s;ary, but that I &s;hould, by &s;plendor of dre&s;s, proclaim my re-union with a higher rank. I therefore &s;ent for my taylor; ordered a &s;uit with twice the u&s;ual quantity of lace; and, that I might not let my per&s;ecutors en|crea&s;e their confidence, by the habit of acco&s;t|ing me, &s;taid at home till it was made.</P>
<P>THIS week of confinement I pa&s;&s;ed in practi&s;ing a forbidding frown, a &s;mile of con|de&s;cen&s;ion, a &s;light &s;alutation, and an abrupt

departure; and in four mornings was able to turn upon my heel, with &s;o much levity and &s;prightline&s;s, that I made no doubt of di&s;|couraging all publick attempts upon my dig|nity. I therefore i&s;&s;ued forth in my new coat, with a re&s;olution of dazzling intimacy to a fitter di&s;tance; and plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the timidity and reverence, which I &s;hould im|pre&s;s upon all who had hitherto pre&s;umed to hara&s;s me with their freedoms. But, what|ever was the cau&s;e, I did not find my&s;elf re|ceived with any new degree of re&s;pect; tho&s;e whom I intended to drive from me, ventured to advance with their u&s;ual phra&s;es of bene|volence; and tho&s;e who&s;e acquaintance I &s;o|licited, grew more &s;upercilious and re&s;erved. I began &s;oon to repent the expence, by which I had procured no advantage, and to &s;u&s;pect, that a &s;hining dre&s;s, like a weighty weapon, has no force in it&s;elf, but owes all its efficacy to him that wears it.</P>
<P>MANY were the mortifications and cala|mities, which I was condemned to &s;uffer in my initiation to politene&s;s. I was &s;o much tortured by the ince&s;&s;ant civilities of my com|panions, that I never pa&s;&s;ed through that re|gion

of the city but in a chair with the cur|tains drawn; and at la&s;t left my lodgings, and fixed my&s;elf in the verge of the court. Here I endeavoured to be thought a gentleman ju&s;t returned from his travels, and was plea&s;ed to have my landlord believe, that I was in &s;ome danger from importunate creditors; but this &s;cheme was quickly defeated by a formal de|putation &s;ent to offer me, though I had now retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, the freedom of my company.</P>
<P>I WAS now detected in trade, and therefore re&s;olved to &s;tay no longer. I hired another apartment, and changed my &s;ervants. Here I lived very happily for three months, and, with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, often overheard the fa|mily celebrating the greatne&s;s and felicity of the e&s;quire; though the conver&s;ation &s;eldom ended without &s;ome complaint of my covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ome remark upon my language, or my gait. I now began to venture into the publick walks, and to know the faces of nobles and beauties; but could not ob&s;erve, without wonder, as I pa&s;&s;ed by them, how frequently they were talking of a taylor. I longed, however, to be admitted to conver&s;ation, and
<PB N="208" REF="209">
was &s;omewhat weary of walking in crouds without a companion, yet continued to come and go with the re&s;t, till a lady whom I en|deavoured to protect in a crouded pa&s;&s;age, as &s;he was about to &s;tep into her chariot, thanked me for my civility, and told me, that, as &s;he had often di&s;tingui&s;hed me for my mode&s;t and re&s;pectful behaviour, whenever I &s;et up for my&s;elf, I might expect to &s;ee her among my fir&s;t cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>HERE was an end of all my ambulatory projects. I indeed &s;ometimes entered the walks again, but was always bla&s;ted by this de&s;tructive lady, who&s;e mi&s;chievous genero|&s;ity recommended me to her acquaintance. Being therefore forced to practi&s;e my ad&s;citi|tious character upon another &s;tage, I betook my&s;elf to a coffee-hou&s;e frequented by wits, among whom I learned in a &s;hort time the cant of critici&s;m, and talked &s;o loudly and volubly of nature, and manners, and &s;enti|ment, and diction, and &s;imilies, and contra&s;ts, and action, and pronunciation, that I was of|ten de&s;ired to lead the hi&s;s and clap, and was feared and hated by the players and the poets. Many a &s;entence have I hi&s;&s;ed, which I did
<PB N="209" REF="210">
not under&s;tand, and many a groan have I ut|tered, when the ladies were weeping in the boxes. At la&s;t a malignant author, who&s;e performance I had per&s;ecuted through the nine nights, wrote an epigram upon <HI>Tape</HI> the critick, which drove me from the pit for ever.</P>
<P>MY de&s;ire to be a fine gentleman &s;till con|tinued: I therefore, after a &s;hort &s;u&s;pen&s;e, cho&s;e a new &s;et of friends at the gaming table, and was for &s;ome time plea&s;ed with the ci|vility and openne&s;s with which I found my|&s;elf treated. I was indeed obliged to play, but, being naturally timorous and vigilant, was never &s;urpri&s;ed into large &s;ums. What might have been the con&s;equence of long fa|miliarity with the&s;e plunderers, I had not an opportunity of knowing; for one night the con&s;tables entered and &s;eized us, and I was once more compelled to &s;ink into my former condition, by &s;ending for my old ma&s;ter to at|te&s;t my character.</P>
<P>WHEN I was deliberating to what new qualifications I &s;hould a&s;pire, I was &s;ummoned
<PB N="210" REF="211">
into the country, by an account of my father's death. Here I had hopes of being able to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, and to &s;upport the honour of my family. I therefore bought guns and hor&s;es, and, contrary to the expectation of the tenants, encrea&s;ed the &s;alary of the hunt&s;|man. But when I entered the field, it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that I was not de&s;tined to the glories of the chace. I was afraid of thorns in the thicket, and of dirt in the mar&s;h; I &s;hivered on the brink of a river while the &s;port&s;men cro&s;&s;ed it, and trembled at the &s;ight of a five-bar gate. When the &s;port and dan|ger were over, I was &s;till equally di&s;concerted; for I was effeminate, though not delicate, and could only join a feebly whi&s;pering voice in the clamours of their triumph.</P>
<P>A FALL, by which my ribs were broken, &s;oon recalled me to dome&s;tick plea&s;ures, and I exerted all my art to obtain the favour of the neighbouring ladies; but where-ever I came, there was always &s;ome unlucky conver&s;ation upon ribbands, fillets, pins, or thread, which drove all my &s;tock of compliments out of my memory, and overwhelmed me with &s;hame and dejection.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212">
THUS I pa&s;&s;ed the ten fir&s;t years after the death of my brother, in which I have learned at la&s;t to repre&s;s that ambition, which I could never gratify; and, in&s;tead of wa&s;ting more of my life in vain endeavours after accompli&s;h|ments, which, if not early acquired, no endea|vours can obtain, I &s;hall confine my care to tho&s;e higher excellencies which are in every man's power; and though I cannot enchant affection by elegance and ea&s;e, hope to &s;ecure e&s;teem by hone&s;ty and truth.</P>

<P>THE &s;ea&s;on of the year is now come in which the theatres are &s;hut, and the card-tables for&s;aken; the regions of luxury are for a while unpeopled, and plea&s;ure leads out her votaries to groves and gardens, to &s;till &s;cenes and erratick gratifications. Tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed many months in a continual tumult of diver&s;ion; who have never opened their eyes in the morning, but upon &s;ome new appointment; nor &s;lept at night without a dream of dances, mu&s;ick, and good hands, or of &s;oft &s;ighs, langui&s;hing looks, and humble &s;upplications; mu&s;t now retire to di&s;tant pro|vinces, where the &s;irens of flattery are &s;carce|ly to be heard, where beauty &s;parkles without prai&s;e or envy, and wit is repeated only by the echo.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214">
AS I think it one of the mo&s;t important duties of &s;ocial benevolence to give warning of the approach of calamity when by timely pre|vention it may be turned a&s;ide, or by pre|paratory mea&s;ures be more ea&s;ily endured, I cannot feel the encrea&s;ing warmth, or ob&s;erve the lengthening days, without con&s;idering the condition of my fair readers, who are now preparing to leave all that has &s;o long filled up their hours, all from which they have been accu&s;tomed to hope for delight; and who, till fa&s;hion proclaims the liberty of returning to the &s;eats of mirth and elegance, mu&s;t en|dure the rugged '&s;quire, the &s;ober hou&s;ewife, the loud hunt&s;man, or the formal par&s;on, the roar of ob&s;treperous jollity, or the dulne&s;s of prudential in&s;truction; without any retreat, but to the gloom of &s;olitude, where they will yet find greater inconveniencies, and mu&s;t learn, however unwillingly, to endure them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN winter, the life of the polite and gay, may be &s;aid to roll on with a &s;trong and rapid current; they float along from plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure, without the trouble of regulating
<PB N="214" REF="215">
their own motions, and per&s;ue the cour&s;e of the &s;tream in all the felicity of inattention; content that they find them&s;elves in progre&s;|&s;ion, and carele&s;s whither they are going. But the months of &s;ummer are a kind of &s;leeping &s;tagnation without wind or tide, where they are left to force them&s;elves for|ward by their own labour, and to direct their pa&s;&s;age by their own &s;kill; and where, if they have not &s;ome internal principle of activity, they mu&s;t be &s;tranded upon &s;hallows, or lie torpid in a perpetual calm.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, &s;ome to whom this univer&s;al di&s;&s;olution of gay &s;ocieties affords a welcome opportunity of quitting without di&s;|grace, the po&s;t which they have found them|&s;elves unable to maintain; and of &s;eeming to retreat only at the call of nature, from a&s;&s;em|blies where, after a &s;hort triumph of uncon|te&s;ted &s;uperiority, they are overpowered by &s;ome new intruder of &s;ofter elegance or &s;prightlier vivacity. By the&s;e, hopele&s;s of vic|tory, and yet a&s;hamed to confe&s;s a conque&s;t, the &s;ummer is regarded as a relea&s;e from the fatiguing &s;ervice of celebrity, a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to more certain joys and a &s;afer empire. They now
<PB N="215" REF="216">
&s;olace them&s;elves with the influence which they &s;hall obtain, where they have no rival to fear; and with the lu&s;tre which they &s;hall effu&s;e, when nothing can be &s;een of brighter &s;plendour. They image, while they are pre|paring for their journey, the admiration with which the ru&s;ticks will croud about them; plan the laws of a new a&s;&s;embly; or contrive to delude provincial ignorance with a fic|titious mode. A thou&s;and plea&s;ing expecta|tions &s;warm in the fancy; and all the ap|proaching weeks are filled with di&s;tinctions, honours, and authority.</P>
<P>BUT others, who have lately entered the world, or have yet had no proofs of its in|con&s;tancy and de&s;ertion, are cut off by this cruel interruption from the enjoyment of their prerogatives, and doomed to lo&s;e four months in unactive ob&s;curity. Many com|plaints do vexation and de&s;ire extort from the&s;e exiled tyrants of the town, again&s;t the inex|orable &s;un, who per&s;ues his cour&s;e without any regard to love or beauty; and vi&s;its either tropick at the &s;tated time, whether &s;hunned or courted, deprecated or implored.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">
TO them who leave the places of publick re&s;ort in the full bloom of reputation, and withdraw from admiration, court&s;hip; &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and applau&s;e; a rural triumph can give nothing equivalent. The prai&s;e of ig|norance, and the &s;ubjection of weakne&s;s, are little regarded by beauties who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to more important conque&s;ts, and more valuable panegyricks. Nor indeed &s;hould the powers which have made havock in the theatres, or borne down rivalry in courts, be degraded to a mean attack upon the un|travelled heir, or ignoble conte&s;t with the ruddy milk-maid.</P>
<P>HOW then mu&s;t four long months be worn away? Four months, in which there will be no routes, no &s;hews, no ridottos; in which vi&s;its mu&s;t be regulated by the weather, and a&s;&s;emblies will depend upon the moon! The Platoni&s;ts imagine, that the future puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who have in this life deba&s;ed their rea|&s;on by &s;ubjection to their &s;en&s;es, and have preferred the gro&s;s gratifications of lewdne&s;s and luxury, to the pure and &s;ublime felicity of virtue and contemplation, will ari&s;e from
<PB N="217" REF="218">
the predominance and &s;olicitations of the &s;ame appetites, in a &s;tate which can furni&s;h no means of appea&s;ing them. I cannot but &s;u|&s;pect that this month, bright with &s;un&s;hine, and fragrant with perfumes; this month, which covers the meadow with verdure, and decks the gardens with all the mixtures of co|lorifick radiance; this month, from which the man of fancy expects new infu&s;ions of ima|gery, and the naturali&s;t new &s;cenes of ob&s;er|vation; this month will chain down multi|tudes to the <HI>Platonick</HI> penance of de&s;ire with|out enjoyment, and hurry them from the highe&s;t &s;atisfactions, which they have yet learned to conceive, into a &s;tate of hopele&s;s wi&s;hes and pining recollection, where the eye of vanity will look round for admiration to no purpo&s;e, and the hand of avarice &s;huffle cards in a bower with ineffectual dexterity.</P>
<P>FROM the tediou&s;ne&s;s of this melancholy &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of life, I would willingly pre&s;erve tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to it, only by inex|perience; who want not inclination to wi&s;|dom or virtue, though they have been di&s;|&s;ipated by negligence, or mi&s;led by example: and who would gladly find the way to rational
<PB N="218" REF="219">
happine&s;s, though it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;truggle with habit, and abandon fa&s;hion. To the&s;e many arts of &s;pending time might be re|commended, which would neither &s;adden the pre&s;ent hour with wearine&s;s, nor the future with repentance.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible to a &s;olitary &s;pe|culati&s;t, that a human being can want em|ployment. To be born in ignorance with a capacity of knowledge, and to be placed in the mid&s;t of a world filled with variety, perpetu|ally pre&s;&s;ing upon the &s;en&s;es and irritating cu|rio&s;ity, is &s;urely a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the langui&s;hment of inattention. Novelty is in|deed nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve eagerne&s;s and ala|crity; but art and nature have &s;tores inex|hau&s;tible by human intellects; and every mo|ment produces &s;omething new to him, who has quickened his faculties by diligent ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>SOME &s;tudies, for which the country and the &s;ummer afford peculiar opportunities, I &s;hall perhaps endeavour to recommend in a future e&s;&s;ay; but if there be any ap|prehen&s;ion not apt to admit unaccu&s;tomed
<PB N="219" REF="220">
ideas, or any attention &s;o &s;tubborn and infle|xible, as not ea&s;ily to comply with new direc|tions, even the&s;e ob&s;tructions cannot exclude the plea&s;ure of application; for there is a higher and nobler employment, to which all faculties are adapted by him who gave them. The duties of religion, &s;incerely and regularly performed, will always be &s;ufficient to exalt the meane&s;t, and to exerci&s;e the highe&s;t un|der&s;tanding. That mind will never be va|cant, which is frequently recalled by &s;tated duties to meditations on eternal intere&s;ts; nor can any hour be long, which is &s;pent in obtaining &s;ome new qualification for cele&s;tial happine&s;s.</P>

<P>IT is one of the maxims of the civil law, that <HI>definitions are hazardous.</HI> Things modified by human under&s;tandings, &s;ubject to varieties of complication, and changeable as experience advances knowledge, or acci|dent influences caprice, are &s;carcely to be in|cluded in any &s;tanding form of expre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they are always &s;uffering &s;ome alter|ation of their &s;tate. Definition is, indeed, not the province of man; every thing is &s;et above or below our faculties. The works and operations of nature are too great in their ex|tent or too much diffu&s;ed in their relations, and the performances of art too incon&s;tant and uncertain, to be reduced to any determi|nate idea. It is impo&s;&s;ible to impre&s;s upon our minds an adequate and ju&s;t repre&s;enta|tion
<PB N="221" REF="222">
of an object &s;o great that we can never take it into our view, or &s;o mutable that it is always changing under our eye, and has already lo&s;t its form while we are labouring to conceive it.</P>
<P>DEFINITIONS have been no le&s;s difficult or uncertain in critici&s;m than in law. Ima|gination, a licentious and vagrant faculty, un|&s;u&s;ceptible of limitations, and impatient of re&s;traint, has always endeavoured to baffle the logician, to perplex the con&s;ines of di&s;tin|ction, and bur&s;t the inclo&s;ures of regularity, There is therefore &s;carcely any &s;pecies of wri|ting, of which we can tell what is its e&s;&s;ence, and what are its con&s;tituents; every new genius produces &s;ome innovation, which, when invented and approved, &s;ubverts the rules which the practice of foregoing authors had e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>COMEDY has been particularly unpropi|tious to definers; for though perhaps they might properly have contented them&s;elves, with declaring it to be <HI>&s;uch a dramatic re|pre&s;entation of human life, as may excite mirth,</HI> they have embarra&s;&s;ed their definition with
<PB N="222" REF="223">
the means by which the comic writers attain their end, without con&s;idering that the va|rious methods of exhilarating their audience, not being limited by nature, cannot be com|pri&s;ed in precept. Thus, &s;ome make comedy a repre&s;entation of mean, and others of bad men; &s;ome think that its e&s;&s;ence con&s;i&s;ts in the unimportance, others in the fictitiou&s;ne&s;s, of the tran&s;action. But any man's reflections will inform him, that every dramatic com|po&s;ition which rai&s;es mirth is comic; and that, to rai&s;e mirth, it is by no means univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, that the per&s;onages &s;hould be either mean or corrupt, nor always requi&s;ite, that the action &s;hould be trivial, nor ever, that it &s;hould be fictitious.</P>
<P>IF the two kinds of dramatick poetry had been defined only by their effects upon the mind, &s;ome ab&s;urdities might have been prevented, with which the compo&s;itions of our greate&s;t poets are di&s;graced, who, for want of &s;ome &s;ettled ideas and accurate di|&s;tinctions, have unhappily confounded tragic with comic &s;entiments. They &s;eem to have thought, that as the meanne&s;s of per&s;onages con&s;tituted comedy, their greatne&s;s was &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="223" REF="224">
to form a tragedy; and that nothing was nece&s;&s;ary to dignity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, but that they &s;hould croud the &s;cene with mon|archs, and generals, and guards; and make them talk, at certain intervals, of the downfal of kingdoms, and the rout of armies. They have not con&s;idered, that thoughts or inci|dents in them&s;elves ridiculous, grow &s;till more grote&s;que by the &s;olemnity of &s;uch cha|racters; that rea&s;on and nature are uniform and inflexible; and that what is de&s;picable and ab&s;urd, will not, by any a&s;&s;ociation with &s;plendid titles, become rational or great; that the mo&s;t important affairs, by an inter|mixture of an un&s;ea&s;onable levity, may be made contemptible; and that the robes of royalty can give no protection to non&s;en&s;e or to folly.</P>
<P>"COMEDY," &s;ays <HI>Horace,</HI> "&s;ometimes rai&s;es her voice;" and tragedy may like|wi&s;e on proper occa&s;ions abate her dignity; but as the comic per&s;onages can only depart from their familiarity of &s;tile, when the more violent pa&s;&s;ions are put in motion, the heroes and queens of tragedy &s;hould never de&s;cend to trifle, but in the hours of ea&s;e, and inter|mi&s;&s;ions

<P>IN this &s;cene, every circum&s;tance concurs to turn tragedy to farce. The wild ab&s;urdity of the expedient; the contemptible &s;ubjection of the lover; the folly of obliging him to read the letter only becau&s;e it ought to have been concealed from him; the frequent interrup|tions of amorous impatience; the faint ex|po&s;tulations of a voluntary &s;lave; the imperi|ous haughtine&s;s of a tyrant without power; the deep reflection of the yielding rebel upon fate and free-will; and his wi&s;e wi&s;h to lo&s;e his rea&s;on as &s;oon as he finds him&s;elf about to do what he cannot per&s;uade his rea&s;on to ap|prove, are &s;urely &s;ufficient to awaken the mo&s;t torpid ri&s;ibility.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carce a tragedy of the la&s;t cen|tury
<PB N="229" REF="230">
which has not deba&s;ed its mo&s;t important incidents, and polluted its mo&s;t &s;erious inter|locutions with buffoonry and meanne&s;s; but though perhaps it cannot be pretended that the pre&s;ent age has added much to the force and efficacy of the drama, it has at lea&s;t been able to e&s;cape many faults, which either igno|rance had overlooked, or indulgence had licen&s;|ed. The later tragedies indeed have faults of another kind, perhaps more de&s;tructive to de|light, though le&s;s open to cen&s;ure. That per|petual tumor of phra&s;e with which every thought is now expre&s;&s;ed by every per&s;onage, the paucity of adventures which regularity ad|mits, and the unvaried equality of flowing dialogue, has taken away from our pre&s;ent writers almo&s;t all that dominion over the pa&s;|&s;ions which was the boa&s;t of their predece&s;|&s;ors. Yet they may at lea&s;t claim this com|mendation, that they avoid gro&s;s faults, and that if they cannot often move terror or pity, they are always careful not to provoke laugh|ter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG other topicks of conver&s;ation which your papers &s;upply, I was lately engaged in a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the character given by <HI>Tranquilla</HI> of her lover <HI>Venu&s;tulus,</HI> whom, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of his mi&s;tre&s;s, the greater number &s;eemed inclined to ac|quit of unmanly or culpable timidity.</P>
<P>ONE of the company remarked, that pru|dence ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from fear; and that if <HI>Venu&s;tulus</HI> was afraid of nocturnal adventures, no man who con&s;idered how much every avenue of the town was infe&s;ted with robbers could think him blameable; for why &s;hould life be hazarded without pro&s;pect of
<PB N="231" REF="232">
honour or advantage? Another was of opinion, that a brave man might be afraid of cro&s;&s;ing the river in the calme&s;t weather; and declared, that, for his part, while there were coaches and a bridge, he would never be &s;een totter|ing in a wooden ca&s;e, out of which he might be thrown by any irregular agitation, or which might be over&s;et by accident, or negligence, or by the force of a &s;udden gu&s;t, or the ru&s;h of a larger ve&s;&s;el. It was his cu&s;tom, he &s;aid, to keep the &s;ecurity of day-light, and dry ground; for it was a maxim with him, that no wi&s;e man ever peri&s;hed by water, or was lo&s;t in the dark.</P>
<P>THE next was humbly of opinion, that if <HI>Tranquilla</HI> had &s;een, like him, the cattle run roaring about the meadows in the hot months, &s;he would not have thought meanly of her lover for not venturing his &s;afety among them. His neighbour then told us, that for his part he was not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that he could not &s;ee a rat, though it was dead, without pal|pitation; that he had been driven &s;ix times out of his lodging either by rats or mice; and that he always had a bed in the clo&s;et for his &s;ervants, whom he called up whenever the
<PB N="232" REF="233">
enemy was in motion. Another wondered that any man &s;hould think him&s;elf di&s;graced by a precipitate retreat from a dog; for there was always a po&s;&s;ibility that a dog might be mad; and that &s;urely, though there was no danger but of being bit by a fierce animal, there was more wi&s;dom in flight than con|te&s;t. By all the&s;e declarations another was encouraged to confe&s;s, that if he had been ad|mitted to the honour of paying his addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Tranquilla,</HI> he &s;hould have been likely to incur the &s;ame cen&s;ure; for among all the ani|mals upon which nature has impre&s;&s;ed defor|mity and horror, there was none whom he dur&s;t not encounter rather than a beetle.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, tho' cowardice is univer&s;ally defined too clo&s;e and anxious an attention to per&s;onal &s;afety, there will be found &s;carcely any fear, however exce&s;&s;ive in its Degree, or unrea|&s;onable in its object, which will be allowed to characterize a coward. Fear is a pa&s;&s;ion which every man feels &s;o frequently predominant in his own brea&s;t, that he is unwilling to hear it cen&s;ured with great a&s;perity; and, perhaps, if we confe&s;s the truth, the &s;ame re&s;traint which would hinder a man from declaiming
<PB N="233" REF="234">
again&s;t the frauds of any employment among tho&s;e who profe&s;s it, &s;hould with-hold him from treating fear with contempt among human be|ings.</P>
<P>YET &s;ince fortitude is one of tho&s;e virtues which the condition of our nature makes hour|ly nece&s;&s;ary, I think you cannot better direct your admonitions than again&s;t &s;uperfluous and panick terrors. Fear is indeed implanted in us as a pre&s;ervative from evil; but its duty, like that of other pa&s;&s;ions, is not to overbear rea|&s;on, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t it; nor &s;hould it be &s;uffered to tyrannize in the imagination, to blind the di&s;cernment, or ob&s;truct activity, to rai&s;e phantoms of horror, or be&s;et life with &s;uper|numerary di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>TO be always afraid of lo&s;ing life, is, in|deed, &s;carcely to enjoy a life that can de&s;erve the care of pre&s;ervation. He that once in|dulges idle fears will never be at re&s;t. Our pre&s;ent &s;tate admits only of a kind of nega|tive &s;ecurity; we mu&s;t conclude our&s;elves &s;afe when we &s;ee no danger, or none inadequate to our powers of oppo&s;ition. Death indeed continually hovers about us, but hovers com|monly
<PB N="234" REF="235">
un&s;een, unle&s;s we &s;harpen our &s;ight by u&s;ele&s;s curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>THERE is always a point at which caution, however &s;olicitous, mu&s;t limit its pre&s;erva|tives, becau&s;e one terror often counteracts another. I once knew one of the &s;peculati&s;ts of cowardice who&s;e reigning di&s;turbance was the dread of hou&s;e-breakers. His enquiries were for nine years employed upon the be&s;t method of barring a window, or a door; and many an hour has he &s;pent in e&s;tabli&s;hing the preference of a bolt to a lock. He had at la&s;t, by the daily &s;uperaddition of new expedients, contrived a door which could never be for|ced; for one bar was &s;ecured by another with &s;uch intricacy of &s;ubordination, that he was him&s;elf not always able to di&s;engage them in the proper method. He was happy in this fortification, till being a&s;ked how he would e&s;cape if he was threatened by fire, he di&s;co|vered, that with all his care, and all his ex|pence, he had only been a&s;&s;i&s;ting his own de|&s;truction. He then immediately tore off his bolts, and now leaves at night his outer door half locked, that he may not by his own folly peri&s;h in the flames.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">
THERE is one &s;pecies of terror which tho&s;e who are unwilling to &s;uffer the reproach of cowardice have wi&s;ely dignified with the name of <HI>antipathy.</HI> A man who talks with intrepidity of the mon&s;ters of the wilderne&s;s while they are out of &s;ight, will readily con|fe&s;s his <HI>antipathy</HI> to a mole, a wea&s;el, or a frog. He has indeed no dread of harm from an in&s;ect or a worm, but his <HI>antipathy</HI> turns him pale whenever they approach him. He believes that a boat will tran&s;port him with as much &s;afety as his neighbours, but he cannot conquer his <HI>antipathy</HI> to the water. Thus he goes on without any reproach from his own reflections, and every day multiplies <HI>antipa|thies,</HI> till he becomes contemptible to others and burden&s;ome to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is indeed certain, that impre&s;&s;ions of dread may &s;ometimes be unluckily made by objects not in them&s;elves ju&s;tly formidable; but when fear is di&s;covered to be groundle&s;s, it is to be eradicated like other fal&s;e opinions, and <HI>antipathies</HI> are generally &s;uperable by a &s;ingle effort. He that has been taught to &s;hud|der at a mou&s;e, if he can per&s;uade him|&s;elf
<PB N="236" REF="237">
to ri&s;que one encounter, will find his own &s;uperiority, and exchange his terrors for the pride of conque&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you profe&s;s to extend your regard to the minutene&s;s of decency and accom|modation, as well as to the dignity of &s;cience, and importance of &s;everer duties, I cannot forbear to lay before you a mode of per&s;ecu|tion by which I have been exiled to taverns and coffee-hou&s;es, and deterred from enter|ing the doors of my friends.</P>
<P>AMONG the ladies who plea&s;e them&s;elves with &s;plendid furniture, or elegant entertain|ment, it is a practice, if not univer&s;al, yet every common, to a&s;k every gue&s;t how he likes the carved work of the cornice, or the figures of the tape&s;try; the china at the table, or the plate on the &s;ide-board; and on all occa&s;ions to enquire his opinion of their judgment and their choice. <HI>Melania</HI> has laid her new watch
<PB N="237" REF="238">
in the window nineteen times, that &s;he may de&s;ire me to look upon it. <HI>Calli&s;ta</HI> has an art of dropping her &s;nuff-box by drawing out her handkerchief, that when I pick it up, I may admire it; and <HI>Fulgentia</HI> has conducted me, by mi&s;take, into the wrong room, at every vi&s;it I have paid &s;ince her picture was put into a new frame.</P>
<P>I HOPE, Mr. RAMBLER, you will inform them, that no man &s;hould be denied the privi|lege of &s;ilence, or tortured to fal&s;e declarations; and that though ladies may ju&s;tly claim to be exempt from rudene&s;s, they have no right to force unwilling civilities. To plea&s;e is a laudable and elegant ambition, and is properly rewarded with hone&s;t prai&s;e; but to &s;eize ap|plau&s;e by violence, and call out for commen|dation, without knowing, or caring to know, whether it be given from conviction, is a &s;pe|cies of tyranny by which mode&s;ty is oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;incerity corrupted. The tribute of ad|miration thus exacted by impudence and im|portunity, differs from the re&s;pect paid to &s;i|lent merit, as the plunder of a pirate from the merchant's profit.</P>

<P>YOUR great predece&s;&s;or, the Spectator, endeavoured to diffu&s;e among his fe|male readers a de&s;ire of knowledge; nor can I charge you, though you do not &s;eem equally attentive to the ladies, with endeavouring to di&s;courage them from any laudable per&s;uit. But however either he or you may excite our curio&s;ity, you have not yet informed us how it may be gratified.

<P>I ENQUIRED ye&s;terday of a gentleman eminent for a&s;tronomical &s;kill, what made the day long in &s;ummer, and &s;hort in winter; and was told that nature protracted the days in &s;ummer, le&s;t ladies &s;hould want time to walk in the park; and the nights in winter, le&s;t they &s;hould not have hours &s;ufficient to &s;pend at the card-table.</P>

I a&s;k|ed the que&s;tion with no other intention than to &s;et him free from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ilence and gave him an opportunity of mingling on equal terms with a polite a&s;&s;embly from which, however unea&s;y, he could not then e&s;cape, by a kind introduction of the only &s;ubject on which I believed him able to &s;peak with propriety.</P>

<P><HI>POLITIAN,</HI> a name eminent among the re&s;torers of polite literature, when he publi&s;hed a collection of epigrams, prefix|ed to many of them the year of his age at which they were compo&s;ed. He might de|&s;ign by this information, either to boa&s;t the early maturity of his genius, or to conciliate indulgence to the puerility of his performances. But whatever was his intent, it is remarked by <HI>Scaliger,</HI> that he very little promoted his own reputation, becau&s;e he fell below the pro|mi&s;e which his fir&s;t productions had given, and in the latter part of life &s;eldom equalled the &s;allies of his youth.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon for tho&s;e who at their fir&s;t entrance into the world were di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for eminent attainments or &s;uperior abili|ties, to di&s;appoint the hopes which they had
<PB N="241" REF="242">
rai&s;ed, and to end in neglect and ob&s;curity that life which they began in celebrity and honour. To the long catalogue of the in|conveniencies of old age, which moral and &s;atirical writers have &s;o copiou&s;ly di&s;played, may be often added the lo&s;s of fame.</P>
<P>THE advance of the human mind towards any object of laudable per&s;uit, may be com|pared to the progre&s;s of a body driven by a blow. It moves for a time with great velo|city and vigour, but the force of the fir&s;t im|pul&s;e is perpetually decrea&s;ing, and though it &s;hould encounter no ob&s;tacle capable of quell|ing it by a &s;udden &s;top, the re&s;i&s;tance of the medium through which it pa&s;&s;es, and the la|tent inequalities of the &s;moothe&s;t &s;urface will in a &s;hort time by continued retardation wholly overpower it. Some hindrances will be found in every road of life, but he that fixes his eyes upon any thing at a di&s;tance nece&s;&s;ari|ly lo&s;es &s;ight of all that fills up the interme|diate &s;pace, and therefore &s;ets forward with alacrity and confidence, nor &s;u&s;pects a thou|&s;and ob&s;tacles by which he afterwards finds his pa&s;&s;age embarra&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tructed. Some are indeed &s;topt at once in their career by a &s;ud|den
<PB N="242" REF="243">
&s;hock of calamity, or diverted to a different direction by the cro&s;s impul&s;e of &s;ome violent pa&s;&s;ion; but far the greater part langui&s;h by &s;low degrees, deviate at fir&s;t into &s;light obli|quities, and them&s;elves &s;carcely perceive at what time their ardour for&s;ook them, or when they lo&s;t &s;ight of their original de&s;ign.</P>
<P>WEARINESS and negligence are perpetu|ally prevailing by &s;ilent encroachments, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by different cau&s;es, and not ob&s;erved till they cannot, without great difficulty, be op|po&s;ed. Labour nece&s;&s;arily requires pau&s;es of ea&s;e and relaxation, and the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of ea&s;e commonly makes us unwilling to return to labour. We, perhaps, prevail upon our|&s;elves to renew our attempts, but eagerly li&s;ten to every argument for frequent interpo&s;itions of amu&s;ement; for when indolence has once entered upon the mind, it can &s;carcely be di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but by &s;uch efforts as very few are found willing to exert.</P>
<P>IT is the fate of indu&s;try to be equally en|dangered by mi&s;carriage and &s;ucce&s;s, by confi|dence and de&s;pondency. He that engages in a great undertaking with a fal&s;e opinion of its
<PB N="243" REF="244">
facility, or too high conceptions of his own &s;trength, is ea&s;ily di&s;couraged by the fir&s;t hin|drance of his advances, becau&s;e he had promi|&s;ed him&s;elf an equal and perpetual progre&s;&s;ion without impediment or di&s;turbance; when un|expected interruptions break in upon him, he is in the &s;tate of a man &s;urpri&s;ed by a tempe&s;t where he purpo&s;ed only to ba&s;k in the calm, or &s;port in the &s;hallows.</P>
<P>IT is not only common to find the difficulty of an enterprize greater, but the profit le&s;s, than hope had pictured it. Youth enters the world with very happy prejudices in her own favour. She imagines her&s;elf not only certain of ac|compli&s;hing every adventure, but of obtaining tho&s;e rewards which the accompli&s;hment may de&s;erve. She is not ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to be|lieve that the force of merit can be re&s;i&s;ted by ob&s;tinacy and avarice, or its lu&s;tre darkened by envy and malignity. She has not yet learned that the mo&s;t evident claims to prai&s;e or pre|ferment may be rejected by malice again&s;t conviction, or by indolence without exami|nation; that they may be &s;ometimes defeated by artifices, and &s;ometimes overborn by clamour; that in the mingled numbers of mankind,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
many need no other provocation to enmity than that they find them&s;elves excelled; that others have cea&s;ed their curio&s;ity, and con&s;ider every man who fills the mouth of report with a new name, as an intruder upon their re|treat, and di&s;turber of their repo&s;e; that &s;ome are engaged in complications of intere&s;t which they imagine endangered by every innovation; that many yield them&s;elves up implicitly to every report which hatred di&s;&s;eminates or folly &s;catters; and that whoever a&s;pires to the notice of the publick, he has in almo&s;t every man an enemy and a rival; and mu&s;t &s;truggle with the oppo&s;ition of the daring, and elude the &s;tratagems of the timorous, mu&s;t quicken the frigid and &s;often the obdurate, mu&s;t reclaim perver&s;ene&s;s and inform &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder that when the pro&s;pect of reward has vani&s;hed, the zeal of enterprize &s;hould cea&s;e; for who would per&s;evere to cul|tivate the &s;oil which he has, after long labour, di&s;covered to be barren? He who had plea&s;ed him&s;elf with anticipated prai&s;es, and expected that he &s;hould meet in every place with pa|tronage or friend&s;hip, will &s;oon remit his vi|gour, when he finds that from tho&s;e who de|&s;ire
<PB N="245" REF="246">
to be con&s;idered as his admirers nothing can be hoped but cold civility, and that many refu&s;e to own his excellence, le&s;t they &s;hould be too ju&s;tly expected to reward it.</P>
<P>A MAN thus cut off from the pro&s;pect of that port to which his addre&s;s and fortitude had been employed to &s;teer him, often aban|dons him&s;elf to chance and to the wind, and glides carele&s;s and idle down the current of life, without re&s;olution to make another effort, till he is &s;wallowed up by the gulph of mortality.</P>
<P>OTHERS are betrayed to the &s;ame de&s;er|tion of them&s;elves by a contrary fallacy. It was &s;aid of <HI>Hannibal</HI> that he wanted nothing to the completion of his martial virtues, but that when he had gained a victory he &s;hould know how to u&s;e it. The folly of de&s;i&s;ting too &s;oon from &s;ucce&s;sful labours, and the ha&s;te of enjoying advantages before they are &s;ecu|red, is often fatal to men of impetuous de&s;ire, and ardent imagination, to men who&s;e con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of uncommon powers fills them with pre&s;umption, and who, having born op|po&s;ition down before them, and left emula|tion
<PB N="246" REF="247">
panting behind, are early per&s;uaded to imagine that they have reached the heights of perfection, and that now being no longer in danger from competitors, they may pa&s;s the re&s;t of their days in the enjoyment of their acqui&s;itions, in contemplation of their own &s;u|periority, and in attention to their own prai&s;es, and look unconcerned from their eminence upon the toils and contentions of meaner be|ings.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered in the hour of exultation, that all human excellence is comparative; that no man performs much but in proportion to what others accompli&s;h, or to the time and opportunities which have been allowed him; and that he who &s;tops at any point of excellence is every day &s;inking in e&s;timation, becau&s;e his improvement grows continually more incommen&s;urate to his life. Yet, as no man willingly quits opinions favour|able to him&s;elf, they who have once been ju&s;tly celebrated, imagine that they &s;till have the &s;ame preten&s;ions to regard, and &s;eldom perceive the diminution of their character while there is time to recover it. Nothing then remains but murmurs and remor&s;e; for

<P>THE writers who have undertaken the ta&s;k of reconciling mankind to their pre&s;ent &s;tate, and of relieving the di&s;content produced by the various di&s;tribution of ter|re&s;trial advantages, very frequently remind us that we judge too ha&s;tily of good and evil, that we view only the &s;uperficies of life, and determine of the whole by a very &s;mall part; and that in the condition of men it frequently happens, that grief and fear, anxiety and de|&s;ire, lie hid under the golden robes of pro&s;pe|rity, and the gloom of calamity is cheared by &s;ecret radiations of hope and comfort; as in the works of nature the bog is &s;ometimes
<PB N="249" REF="250">
covered with flowers, and the mine conceal|ed in the barren crags.</P>
<P>NONE but tho&s;e who have learned the art of &s;ubjecting their &s;en&s;es as well as their rea&s;on to hypothetical &s;y&s;tems will be per|&s;uaded by the mo&s;t &s;pecious rhetorician that the lots of life are equal; yet it cannot be de|nied that every one has his peculiar plea&s;ures and vexations, that external accidents operate variou&s;ly upon different minds, and that no man can exactly judge from his own &s;en&s;a|tions what another would feel in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IF the general di&s;po&s;ition of things be e&s;ti|mated by the repre&s;entation which every one makes of his own &s;tate, the world mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as the abode of &s;orrow and mi&s;ery; for how few can forbear to relate their troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es? If we judge by the ac|count which may be obtained of every man's fortune from others, it may be concluded, that we are all placed in an ely&s;ian region, over-&s;pread with the luxuriance of plenty, and fan|ned by the breezes of felicity; &s;ince &s;carcely any complaint is uttered without cen&s;ure
<PB N="250" REF="251">
from tho&s;e that hear it, and almo&s;t all are allowed to have obtained a provi&s;ion at lea&s;t adequate to their virtue or their under&s;tand|ing, to po&s;&s;e&s;s either more than they de&s;erve, or more than they enjoy.</P>
<P>WE are either born with &s;uch di&s;&s;imilitude of temper and inclinations, or receive &s;o many of our ideas and opinions from the &s;tate of life in which we are engaged, and the particular objects by which we are &s;urrounded, that the griefs and cares of one part of mankind &s;eem to the other hypocri&s;y, folly, and affectation. Every cla&s;s of &s;ociety has its cant of lamenta|tion, which is under&s;tood or regarded by none but them&s;elves; and every part of life has its unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, which tho&s;e who do not feel them will not commi&s;erate. An event which &s;preads terror and di&s;traction over half the commercial world, that a&s;&s;embles the trading companies in councils and committees, and &s;inks the hearts and &s;hakes the nerves of a thou&s;and &s;tockjobbers, is read by the landlord and the farmer with frigid indifference. An affair of love which fills the young brea&s;t with ince&s;&s;ant alternations of hope and fear, and &s;teals away the night and day from every other
<PB N="251" REF="252">
plea&s;ure or employment, is regarded by them who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions time has extingui&s;hed, as a tri|vial amu&s;ement, which can properly rai&s;e nei|ther joy, nor &s;orrow, and which, though it may be &s;uffered to fill the vacuity of an idle moment, &s;hould always give way to prudence or intere&s;t.</P>
<P>HE that never had any other de&s;ire than to fill a che&s;t with money, or to add another manour to his e&s;tate, who never grieved but at a bad mortgage, or entered a company but to make a bargain, would be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear of beings known among the polite and gay by the denomination of wits. How would he gape with curio&s;ity, or grin with contempt, at the mention of beings who have no wi&s;h but to &s;peak what was never &s;poke before; who if they happen to inherit wealth, often exhau&s;t their patrimonies in treating tho&s;e who will hear them talk; and if they are poor, neglect a thou&s;and opportunities of im|proving their fortunes for the plea&s;ure of ma|king others laugh? How &s;lowly would he be|lieve that there are men who would rather lo&s;e a legacy than the reputation of a di&s;tich; who think it le&s;s di&s;grace to want money than
<PB N="252" REF="253">
repartee; whom the vexation of having been foiled in a conte&s;t of raillery is &s;ometimes &s;uf|ficient to deprive of &s;leep; and who would e&s;teem it a lighter evil to mi&s;s a profitable bargain by &s;ome accidental delay, than not to have thought of a &s;mart reply till the time of producing it was pa&s;t? How little would he &s;u&s;pect that this child of idlene&s;s and frolick enters every a&s;&s;embly with a beating bo&s;om, like a litigant on the day of deci&s;ion, and revolves the probability of applau&s;e with all the anxiety of a con&s;pirator who&s;e fate de|pends upon the next night; that at the hour of retirement he often carries home, amid&s;t all his airy negligence, a heart lacerated with envy, or depre&s;&s;ed with di&s;appointment; and immures him&s;elf in his clo&s;et, that he may di&s;encumber his memory at lei&s;ure, review the progre&s;s of the day, &s;tate with accuracy his lo&s;s or gain of reputation, and examine the cau&s;es of his failure or &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>AND yet more remote from common con|ceptions are the numerous and re&s;tle&s;s anxie|ties, by which female happine&s;s is particularly di&s;turbed. A &s;olitary philo&s;opher would ima|gine ladies born with an exemption from care
<PB N="253" REF="254">
and &s;orrow, lulled in perpetual &s;ecurity, and fea&s;ted with unmingled plea&s;ure; for what can interrupt the content of tho&s;e, upon whom one age has laboured after another to confer honours, and accumulate immunities; tho&s;e to whom rudene&s;s is infamy, and in&s;ult is cowardice; who&s;e eye commands the brave, and who&s;e &s;mile &s;oftens the &s;evere; whom the &s;ailor travels to adorn, the &s;oldier bleeds to defend, and the poet wears out life to cele|brate; who claim tribute from every art and &s;cience, and for whom all who approach them endeavour to multiply delights, without re|quiring from them any return but willingne&s;s to be plea&s;ed?</P>
<P>SURELY, among the&s;e favourites of nature, thus unacquainted with toil and danger, feli|city mu&s;t have fixed her re&s;idence; they mu&s;t know only the changes of more vivid or more gentle joys; their life mu&s;t always move either to the &s;low or &s;prightly melody of the lyre of gladne&s;s; they can never a&s;&s;emble but to plea|&s;ure, or retire but to peace.</P>
<P>SUCH would be the thoughts of every man who &s;hould hover at a di&s;tance round the
<PB N="254" REF="255">
world, and know it only by conjecture and &s;peculation. But experience will &s;oon di&s;co|ver how ea&s;ily tho&s;e are di&s;gu&s;ted who have been made nice by plenty, and tender by in|dulgence. He will &s;oon &s;ee to how many dangers power is expo&s;ed which has no other guard than youth and beauty, and how ea&s;ily that tranquillity is mole&s;ted which can only be &s;oothed with the &s;ongs of flattery. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;upply wants as fa&s;t as an idle ima|gination may be able to form them, or to re|move all inconveniencies by which elegance refined into impatience may be offended. None are &s;o hard to plea&s;e as tho&s;e whom &s;atiety of plea&s;ure makes weary of them&s;elves; nor any &s;o readily provoked as tho&s;e who have been always courted with an emulation of civi|lity.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;ome &s;trokes which the envy of fate aims immediately at the fair. The mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Catullus</HI> wept for her &s;parrow many centuries ago, and lapdogs will be &s;ometimes &s;ick in the pre&s;ent age. The mo&s;t fa&s;hionable brocade is &s;ubject to &s;tains; a pinner, the pride of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> may be torn by a carele&s;s wa&s;her; a picture may drop from a watch; or the tri|umph
<PB N="255" REF="256">
of a new &s;uit may be interrupted on the fir&s;t day of its enjoyment, and all di&s;tinctions of dre&s;s unexpectedly obliterated by a general mourning.</P>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate of every age, every &s;ex, and every condition; all have their cares, either from nature or from folly: and whoever therefore finds him&s;elf inclined to envy an|other, &s;hould remember that he knows not the real condition which he de&s;ires to obtain, but is certain that by indulging a vicious pa&s;&s;ion, he mu&s;t le&s;&s;en that happine&s;s which he thinks already too &s;paringly be&s;towed.</P>

<P>THE greater part of morali&s;ts, like other writers, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting their eyes abroad into the living world, and endea|vouring to form from their own ob&s;ervations new maxims of practice and new hints of theo|ry, content their curio&s;ity with that &s;econdary knowledge which the peru&s;al of books affords, and think them&s;elves entitled to reverence and to fame by a new arrangement of an ancient &s;y&s;tem, or new illu&s;tration of e&s;tabli&s;hed prin|ciples. The &s;age precepts of the fir&s;t in&s;truc|tors of the world are tran&s;mitted from age to age with little variation, and echoed from one
<PB N="257" REF="258">
author to another, not perhaps without &s;ome lo&s;s of their original force at every repercu&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether any other rea&s;on than this idlene&s;s of imitation can be a&s;&s;igned for that uniform and con&s;tant partiality, by which &s;ome vices have hitherto e&s;caped cen|&s;ure, and &s;ome virtues wanted recommenda|tion; nor can I di&s;cover why el&s;e we have been warned only again&s;t part of our enemies, while the re&s;t have been &s;uffered to &s;teal up|on us without notice; or why on one &s;ide the heart has been doubly fortified, while it has lain open on the other to the incur&s;ions of error, and the ravages of vice.</P>
<P>AMONG the favourite topicks of moral de|clamation, may be numbered the dangers and mi&s;carriages of imprudent boldne&s;s, the folly of attempts beyond our power, and the nece&s;&s;ity of mode&s;t diffidence and cautious deliberation. Every page of every philo&s;opher is crouded with examples of temerity that &s;unk under burthens which &s;he laid upon her&s;elf, and called out enemies to battle by whom &s;he was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
THEIR remarks are certainly too ju&s;t to be di&s;puted, and too &s;alutary to be rejected; but there is likewi&s;e &s;ome danger le&s;t timorous prudence &s;hould be too &s;trongly inculcated, le&s;t courage and enterprize &s;hould be wholly repre&s;&s;ed, and the mind congealed in perpe|tual inactivity by the fatal influence of fri|gorifick wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>EVERY man &s;hould, indeed, carefully com|pare his force with his undertaking; for though we ought not to live only for our own &s;akes, or act with regard folely to our own advantage, and though therefore danger or difficulty &s;hould not be avoided merely becau&s;e we may expo&s;e our&s;elves to mi&s;ery or di&s;grace; yet it may be ju&s;tly required of us, not to ha|zard our lives, or throw away our labour, upon inadequate and hopele&s;s de&s;igns, &s;ince we might by a more ju&s;t e&s;timate of our abilities have become more u&s;eful to mankind.</P>
<P>THERR is, doubtle&s;s, an irrational con|tempt of danger which approaches very near|ly to the folly, if not the guilt, of &s;uicide: there is a ridiculous per&s;everance in imprac|ticable
<PB N="259" REF="260">
&s;chemes, which is ju&s;tly puni&s;hed with ignominy and reproach. But in the wide regions of probability which are the proper province of prudence and election, there is always room to deviate on either &s;ide of rectitude without ru&s;hing again&s;t apparent ab&s;urdity; and ac|cording to the inclinations of nature, or the impre&s;&s;ions of precept, the daring and the cau|tious may move in different directions without touching upon ra&s;hne&s;s or cowardice.</P>
<P>THAT there is a middle path which it is every man's duty to find, and to ob&s;erve, is unanimou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed; but it is likewi&s;e uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged that this middle path is &s;o narrow, that it cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;cover|ed, and &s;o little beaten that there are no cer|tain marks by which it can be followed; the care therefore of all tho&s;e who have undertaken conduct others has been, that whenever they decline into obliquities, they &s;hould be cer|tain to tend towards the &s;ide of &s;afety.</P>
<P>IT can, indeed, rai&s;e no wonder that te|merity has been generally cen&s;ured; for it is one of the vices with which few can be charg|ed, and which therefore great numbers are
<PB N="260" REF="261">
ready to condemn. It is the vice of noble and generous minds, the exuberance of mag|nanimity, and the ebullition of genius; and is therefore not regarded with much tender|ne&s;s, becau&s;e it never flatters us by that ap|pearance of &s;oftne&s;s and imbeciility which is commonly nece&s;&s;ary to conciliate compa&s;&s;ion. But if the &s;ame attention had been applied to the &s;earch of arguments again&s;t cold de&s;pond|ency, again&s;t the mean and cowardly dere|liction of our&s;elves, and the folly of pre&s;up|po&s;ing impo&s;&s;ibilities, and anticipating fru|&s;tration, I know not whether many would not have been rou&s;ed to u&s;efulne&s;s, who, having been taught to confound prudence with timi|dity, never ventured to excel left they &s;hould unfortunately fail.</P>
<P>IT is always nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h our own intere&s;t from that of others, and that di|&s;tinction will perhaps a&s;&s;i&s;t us in fixing the ju&s;t limits of caution and adventurou&s;ne&s;s. In an undertaking that involves the happine&s;s, or the &s;afety of many, we have certainly no right to hazard more than is allowed by tho&s;e who partake the dangers; but where only our|&s;elves can &s;uffer by mi&s;carriage, we are not
<PB N="261" REF="262">
confined within &s;uch narrow limits; and &s;till le&s;s is the reproach of temerity, when num|bers will receive advantage by &s;ucce&s;s, and only one be incommoded by failure.</P>
<P>MEN are generally willing to hear precepts by which ea&s;e is favoured; and as no re&s;ent|ment is rai&s;ed by general repre&s;entations of human folly, even in tho&s;e who are mo&s;t emi|nently jealous of comparative reputation, we confe&s;s, without reluctance, that vain man is ignorant of his own weakne&s;s, and there|fore frequently pre&s;umes to attempt what he can never accompli&s;h; but it ought like|wi&s;e to be remembered, that he is no le&s;s ig|norant of his own powers, and might per|haps have accompli&s;hed a thou&s;and de&s;igns, which the prejudices of cowardice re&s;trained him from attempting.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved in the golden ver&s;es of <HI>Py|thagoras,</HI> that <HI>Power is never far from nece&s;|&s;ity.</HI> The vigour of the human mind quickly appears, when there is no longer any place for doubt and he&s;itation, when diffidence is ab&s;orbed in the &s;en&s;e of danger or over-whelmed by &s;ome re&s;i&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion. We then
<PB N="262" REF="263">
&s;oon di&s;cover, that difficulty is, for the mo&s;t part, the daughter of idlene&s;s, that the ob|&s;tacles with which our way &s;eemed to be ob|&s;tructed were only phantoms, which we be|lieved real becau&s;e we dur&s;t not advance to a clo&s;e examination; and we learn that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to determine without experience how much con&s;tancy may endure, or diligence per|form.</P>
<P>BUT whatever plea&s;ure may be found in the review of di&s;tre&s;&s;es when art or courage has &s;urmounted them, few will be per&s;uaded to wi&s;h that they may be awakened by want or terror to the conviction of their own abili|ties. Every one &s;hould therefore endeavour to invigorate him&s;elf by rea&s;on and reflection, and determine to exert, in any laudable un|dertaking, the latent force that nature may have repo&s;ited in him again&s;t the hour of exi|gence, before external compul&s;ion &s;hall tor|ture him to diligence. It is below the dignity of a rea&s;onable being to owe that &s;trength to nece&s;&s;ity which ought always to act at the call of choice, or to need any other mo|tive to indu&s;try and per&s;everance than the de|&s;ire of performing the duties of his condition.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">
REFLECTIONS that may at lea&s;t drive away de&s;pair, cannot ea&s;ily be wanting to him who has taken a &s;urvey of the world, and con|&s;iders how much life is now advanced beyond the &s;tate of naked, undi&s;ciplined, unin&s;tructed nature. Whatever has been effected for con|venience or elegance, while it was yet un|known, was believed impo&s;&s;ible; and there|fore would never have been attempted, had not &s;ome, more daring than the re&s;t, adven|tured to bid defiance to prejudice and cen|&s;ure. Nor is there yet any rea&s;on to doubt that the &s;ame labour would be rewarded with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. There are certainly in|numerable qualities in the products of nature yet undi&s;covered, and innumerable combina|tions in the powers of art yet untried. It is the duty of every man to endeavour that &s;omething may be added by his indu&s;try to the hereditary aggregate of knowledge and happi|ne&s;s. To add much can indeed be the lot of few, but to add &s;omething, however little, every one may hope; and of every hone&s;t en|deavour it is certain, that, however un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, it will be at la&s;t rewarded.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have very lately ob&s;erved that in the numerous &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the world, every cla&s;s and order of mankind have joys and &s;orrows of their own; we all feel hourly pain and plea&s;ure from events which pa&s;s un|heeded before other eyes, but can &s;carcely communicate our perceptions to minds preoc|cupied by different objects, any more than the delight of well di&s;po&s;ed colours or harmonious
<PB N="265" REF="266">
&s;ounds can be imparted to &s;uch as want the &s;en&s;es of hearing or of &s;ight.</P>
<P>I AM &s;o &s;trongly convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this remark, and have on &s;o many occa&s;ions di&s;covered with how little attention pride looks upon calamity of which &s;he thinks her|&s;elf not in danger, and indolence li&s;tens to complaint when it is not echoed by her own remembrance, that though I am about to lay the occurrences of my life before you, I que|&s;tion whether you will conde&s;cend to peru&s;e my narrative, or without the help of &s;ome fe|male &s;peculati&s;t be able to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>I WAS bern a beauty. From the dawn of rea&s;on I had my regard turned wholly upon my&s;elf, nor can recollect any thing earlier than prai&s;e and admiration. My mother, who&s;e face had luckily advanced her to a condition above her birth, thought no evil &s;o great as deformity. She had not the power of imagin|ing any other defect than a cloudy complexion, or di&s;proportionate features; and therefore contemplated me as an a&s;&s;emblage of all that could rai&s;e envy or de&s;ire, and predicted with
<PB N="266" REF="267">
triumphant fondne&s;s the extent of my con|que&s;ts, and the number of my &s;laves.</P>
<P>SHE never mentioned any of my young acquaintance before me, but to remark how much they fell below my perfection; how one would have had a fineface but that her eyes were without lu&s;tre; how another &s;truck the &s;ight at a di&s;tance, but wanted my hair and teeth at a nearer view; another di&s;graced an ele|gant &s;hape with a brown &s;kin; &s;ome had &s;hort fingers, and others had dimples in a wrong place.</P>
<P>AS &s;he expected no happine&s;s nor advan|tage but from beauty, &s;he thought nothing but beauty worthy of her care; and her maternal kindne&s;s was chiefly exerci&s;ed in contrivan|ces to protect me from any accident that might deface me with a &s;car, or &s;tain me with a freckle: &s;he never thought me &s;ufficiently &s;haded from the &s;un, or &s;creened from the fire. She was &s;evere or indulgent with no other intention than the pre&s;ervation of my form; &s;he excu&s;ed me from work, le&s;t I &s;hould learn to hang down my head, or harden my finger with a needle; &s;he &s;natched away my book,
<PB N="267" REF="268">
becau&s;e a young lady in the neighbourhood had made her eyes red with reading by a can|dle; but &s;he would &s;carcely &s;uffer me to eat, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;poil my &s;hape, nor to walk, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;well my ancle with a &s;prain. At night I was accurately &s;urveyed from head to foot, le&s;t I &s;hould have &s;uffered any diminu|tion of my charms in the adventures of the day; and was never permitted to &s;leep, till I had pa&s;&s;ed through the co&s;metick di&s;cipline, part of which was a regular lu&s;tration per|formed with bean-flower water and may|dews; my hair was perfumed with variety of unguents, by &s;ome of which it was to be thick|ened, and by others to be curled. The &s;oft|ne&s;s of my hands was &s;ecured by medicated gloves, and my bo&s;om rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother, of virtue to di&s;cu&s;s pimples, and clear di&s;colorations.</P>
<P>I WAS always called up early, becau&s;e the morning air gives a fre&s;hne&s;s to the cheeks; but I was placed behind a curtain in my mo|ther's chamber, becau&s;e the neck is ea&s;ily tan|ned by the ri&s;ing &s;un. I was then dre&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;and precautions, and again heard my own prai&s;es, and triumphed in the compli|ments
<PB N="268" REF="269">
and progno&s;tications of all that ap|proached me.</P>
<P>MY mother was not &s;o much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of my natural excellencies as not to think &s;ome cultivation nece&s;&s;ary to their completion. She took care that I &s;hould want none of the accompli&s;hments included in female education, or con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary in fa&s;hionable life. I was looked upon in my ninth year as the chief ornament of the dan|cing-ma&s;ter's ball, and Mr. <HI>Ariet</HI> u&s;ed to re|proach his other &s;cholars with my perform|ances on the harp&s;ichord. At twelve I was remarkable for playing my cards with great elegance of manner, and accuracy of judgment.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the time came when my mother thought me perfect in my exerci&s;es, and qua|lified to di&s;play in the open world tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments which had yet only been di&s;|covered in &s;elect parties, or dome&s;tic a&s;&s;em|blies. Preparations were therefore made for my appearance on a publick night, which &s;he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important and cri|tical moment of my life. She cannot be
<PB N="269" REF="270">
charged with neglecting any means of recom|mendation, or leaving any thing to chance which prudence could a&s;certain. Every orna|ment was tried in every po&s;ition, every friend was con&s;ulted about the colour of my dre&s;s, and the manteaumakers were hara&s;&s;ed with directions and alterations.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the night arrived from which my future life was to be reckoned. I was dre&s;&s;ed and &s;ent out to conquer, with a heart beating like that of an old knight errant at his fir&s;t fally. Scholars have told me of a <HI>Spartan</HI> ma|tron, who, when &s;he armed her &s;on for battle, bade him bring back his &s;hield or be brought upon it. My venerable parent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me to a field, in her opinion of equal glory, with a command to &s;hew that I was her daughter, and not to return without a lover.</P>
<P>I WENT, and was received like other plea&s;|ing novelties with a tumult of applau&s;e. Every man who valued him&s;elf upon the graces of his per&s;on, or the elegance of his addre&s;s, crouded about me, and wit and &s;plendor contended for my notice. I was delightfully fatigued with ince&s;&s;ant civilities, which were made
<PB N="270" REF="271">
more plea&s;ing by the apparent envy of tho&s;e whom my pre&s;ence expo&s;ed to neglect. I returned with an attendant equal in rank and wealth to my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes, and from this time &s;tood in the fir&s;t rank of beauty, was followed by gazers in the mall, celebrated in the papers of the day, imitated by all who endeavoured to ri&s;e into fa&s;hion, and cen&s;ured by tho&s;e whom age or di&s;appoint|ment forced to retire.</P>
<P>MY mother, who plea&s;ed her&s;elf with the hopes of &s;eeing my exaltation, dre&s;&s;ed me with all the exuberance of finery; and when I re|pre&s;ented to her that a fortune might be ex|pected proportionate to my appearance, told me that &s;he &s;hould &s;corn the reptile who could enquire after the fortune of a girl like me. She advi&s;ed me to pro&s;ecute my victories, and time would certainly bring me a captive who might de&s;erve the honour of being enchained for ever.</P>
<P>MY lovers were indeed &s;o numerous, that I had no other care than that of determining to whom I &s;hould &s;eem to give the prefe|rence. But having been &s;teadily and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
<PB N="271" REF="272">
in&s;tructed to pre&s;erve my heart from any impre&s;&s;ions which might hinder me from con|&s;ulting my intere&s;t, I acted with le&s;s embar|ra&s;&s;ment, becau&s;e my choice was regulated by principles more clear and certain than the caprice of approbation. When I had &s;ingled out one from the re&s;t as more worthy of en|couragement, I proceeded in my mea&s;ures by the rules of art; and yet when the ardour of the fir&s;t vi&s;its was &s;pent, generally found a &s;udden declen&s;ion of my influence; I felt in my&s;elf the want of &s;ome power to diver&s;ify amu&s;ement, and enliven conver&s;ation, and could not but &s;u&s;pect that my mind failed in performing the promi&s;es of my face. This opinion was &s;oon confirmed by one of my lovers, who married <HI>Lavinia</HI> with le&s;s beauty and fortune than mine, becau&s;e he thought a wife ought to have qualities which might make her amiable when her bloom was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE vanity of my mother would not &s;uffer her to di&s;cover any defect in one that had been formed by her in&s;tructions, and had all the ex|cellence which &s;he her&s;elf could boa&s;t. She told me that nothing &s;o much hindered the
<PB N="272" REF="273">
advancement of women as literature and wit, which generally frightened away tho&s;e that could make the be&s;t &s;ettlements, and drew about them a needy tribe of poets and philo&s;o|phers, that filled their heads with wild notions of content, and contemplation, and virtuous ob&s;curity. She therefore enjoined me to im|prove my minuet &s;tep with a new <HI>French</HI> dancing-ma&s;ter, and wait the event of the next birth-night.</P>
<P>I HAD now almo&s;t completed my nine|teenth year: if my charms had lo&s;t any of their &s;oftne&s;s, it was more than compen&s;ated by additional dignity; and if the attractions of innocence were impaired, their place was &s;up|plied by the arts of allurement. I was there|fore preparing for a new attack, without any abatement of my confidence, when in the mid&s;t of my hopes and &s;chemes, I was &s;eized by that dreadful malady which has &s;o often put a &s;udden end to the tyranny of beauty. I recovered my health after a long confine|ment; but when I looked again on that face which had been often flu&s;hed with tran&s;port at its own reflexion, and &s;aw all that I had learn|ed to value, all that I had endeavoured to
<PB N="273" REF="274">
improve, all that had procured me honours or prai&s;es, irrecoverably de&s;troyed, I &s;unk at once into melancholy and de&s;pondence. My pain was not much confoled or alleviated by my mother, who grieved that I had not lo&s;t my life together with my beauty, and declared, that &s;he thought a young woman dive&s;ted of her charms had nothing for which tho&s;e who loved her could de&s;ire to &s;ave her from the grave.</P>
<P>HAVING thus continued my relation to the period from which my life took a new cour&s;e, I &s;hall conclude it in another letter, if by pub|li&s;hing this you &s;hew any regard for the cor|re&s;pondence of,</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carcely any &s;entiment in which, amid&s;t the innumerable varie|ties of inclination that nature or accident have &s;cattered in the world, we find greater numbers concurring than in the wi&s;h for riches; a wi&s;h indeed &s;o prevalent that it may be con|&s;idered as univer&s;al and tran&s;cendental, as the de&s;ire in which all other de&s;ires are included, and of which the various purpo&s;es which actu|ate mankind are only &s;ubordinate &s;pecies and different modifications.</P>
<P>WEALTH is indeed the general center of inclination, the point to which all minds pre|&s;erve an invariable tendency, and from which they afterwards diverge in numberle&s;s dire|ctions.
<PB N="275" REF="276">
Whatever is the remote or ultimate de&s;ign, the immediate care is to be rich; and in whatever enjoyment we intend finally to acquie&s;ce, we &s;eldom con&s;ider it as attainable but by the means of money. Of wealth there|fore all unanimou&s;ly confe&s;s the value, nor is there any di&s;agreement but about the u&s;e.</P>
<P>NO de&s;ire can be formed which riches do not a&s;&s;i&s;t us to gratify. He that places his happine&s;s in &s;plendid equipage or numerous dependents, in refined prai&s;e or popular ac|clamations, in the accumulation of curio&s;ities or the revels of luxury, in &s;plendid edifices or wide plantations, mu&s;t &s;till either by birth or acqui&s;ition po&s;&s;e&s;s riches. They may be con|&s;idered as the elemental principles of plea&s;ure, which may be combined with endle&s;s diver&s;ity; as the e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;tance, of which only the form is left to be adju&s;ted by choice.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of riches being thus appa|rent, it is not wonderful that almo&s;t every mind has been employed in endeavours to ac|quire them; that multitudes have vied with each other in arts by which life is furni&s;hed
<PB N="276" REF="277">
with accommodations, and which therefore mankind may rea&s;onably be expected to re|ward.</P>
<P>IT had indeed been happy, if this predomi|nant appetite had operated only in concurrence with virtue, by influencing none but tho&s;e who were zealous to de&s;erve what they were eager to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and had abilities to improve their own fortunes by contributing to the ea&s;e or happine&s;s of others. To have riches and to have merit would then have been the &s;ame, and &s;ucce&s;s might rea&s;onably have been con&s;idered as a proof of excellence.</P>
<P>BUT we do not find that any of the wi&s;hes of men keep a &s;tated proportion to their pow|ers of attainment. Many envy and de&s;ire wealth, who can never procure it by hone&s;t indu&s;try or u&s;eful knowledge. They there|fore turn their eyes about to examine what other methods can be &s;ound of gaining that which none, however impotent or worth|le&s;s, will be content to want.</P>
<P>A LITTLE enquiry will di&s;cover that there are nearer ways to profit than through the in|tricacies
<PB N="277" REF="278">
of art, or up the &s;teeps of labour; that what wi&s;dom and virtue &s;carcely receive at the clo&s;e of life, as the recompence of long toil and repeated efforts, is brought within the reach of &s;ubtilty and di&s;hone&s;ty by more ex|peditious and compendious mea&s;ures: that the wealth of credulity is an open prey to fal&s;|hood; and that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of ignorance and imbecillity are ea&s;ily &s;tolen away by the con|veyances of &s;ecret artifice, or &s;eized by the gripe of unre&s;i&s;ted violence.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e not hard to di&s;cover, that riches always procure protection for them|&s;elves, that they dazzle the eyes of enquiry, divert the celerity of pur&s;uit, or appea&s;e the ferocity of vengeance. When any man is in|conte&s;tably known to have large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, very few think it requi&s;ite to enquire by what practices they were obtained; the re&s;entment of mankind rages only again&s;t the &s;truggles of feeble and timorous corruption, but when it has &s;urmounted the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition, it is after|wards &s;upported by favour, and animated by applau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;pect of gaining &s;peedily what is
<PB N="278" REF="279">
ardently de&s;ired, and the certainty of obtaining by every acce&s;&s;ion of advantage an addition of &s;ecurity, have &s;o far prevailed upon the pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, that the peace of life is de&s;troyed by a general and ince&s;&s;ant &s;truggle for riches. It is ob&s;erved of gold, by an old epigramma|ti&s;t, that <HI>to have it is to be in fear, and to want it is to be in &s;orrow.</HI> There is no condition which is not di&s;quieted either with the care of gaining or of keeping money; and the race of man may be divided in a political e&s;timate be|tween tho&s;e who are practi&s;ing fraud, and tho&s;e who are repelling it.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world, it will be found, that all confidence is lo&s;t among mankind, that no man ventures to act where money can be endangered, upon the faith of another. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the long &s;crolls in which every contract is in|cluded, with all their appendages of &s;eals and atte&s;tation, without wondering at the depra|vity of tho&s;e beings, who mu&s;t be re&s;trained from violation of promi&s;e by &s;uch formal and publick evidences, and precluded from equi|vocation and &s;ubterfuge by &s;uch punctilious minutene&s;s. Among all the &s;atires to which
<PB N="279" REF="280">
folly and wickedne&s;s have given occa&s;ion, none is equally &s;evere with a bond or a &s;ettle|ment.</P>
<P>OF the various arts by which riches may be obtained, the greater part are at the fir&s;t view irrreconcileable with the laws of virtue; &s;ome are openly flagitious, and practi&s;ed not only in neglect, but in defiance of faith and ju&s;tice; and the re&s;t are on every &s;ide &s;o en|tangled with dubious tendencies, and &s;o be&s;et with perpetual temptations, that very few, even of tho&s;e who are not yet abandoned, are able to pre&s;erve their innocence, or can pro|duce any other claim to pardon than that they have deviated from the right le&s;s than others, and have &s;ooner and more diligently endea|voured to return.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief characteri&s;ticks of the golden age, of the age in which neither care nor danger had intruded on mankind, is the community of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: &s;trife and fraud were totally excluded, and every turbulent pa&s;&s;ion was &s;tilled, by plenty and equality. Such were indeed happy times, but &s;uch times can return no more. Community of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="280" REF="281">
mu&s;t always include &s;pontaneity of pro|duction; for what is only to be obtained by labour, mu&s;t be of right the property of him by who&s;e labour it is gained. And while a rightful claim to plea&s;ure or to affluence mu&s;t be procured either by &s;low indu&s;try or uncer|tain hazard, there will always be multitudes whom cowardice or impatience will incite to more &s;afe and more &s;peedy methods, who will &s;trive to pluck the fruit without cultivating the tree, and to &s;hare the advantages of victory without partaking the danger of the battle.</P>
<P>IN later ages, the conviction of the danger to which virtue is expo&s;ed while the mind continues open to the influence of riches, has determined many to vows of perpetual pover|ty; they have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed de&s;ire by cutting off the po&s;&s;ibility of gratification, and &s;ecured their peace by de&s;troying the enemy whom they had no hope of reducing to quiet &s;ub|jection. But by debarring them&s;elves from evil, they have re&s;cinded many opportunities of good; they have too often &s;unk into in|activity and u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s; and though they have forborn to injure &s;ociety, have not fully paid their contributions to its happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="282">
WHILE riches are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;ent convenience, and &s;o much more ea&s;ily ob|tained by crimes than virtues, the mind can only be &s;ecured from yielding to the con|tinual impul&s;e of covetou&s;ne&s;s by the pre|ponderation of unchangeable and eternal motives. Gold will generally turn the in|tellectual balance, when weighed only again&s;t reputation; but will be light and ineffectual when the opopo&s;ite &s;cale is charged with ju&s;|tice, veracity, and piety.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was bred a &s;cholar, and having pa&s;&s;ed the u&s;ual cour&s;e of education at lea&s;t with common proficiency and credit, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ for the &s;upport of life that learning which I had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted my little fortune in acquiring. The lucrative profe&s;&s;ions drew my regard with equal at|traction: each had its peculiar advantages and inconveniences; each pre&s;ented ideas which excited my curio&s;ity, and each impo&s;ed duties which terrified my apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE is no temper more unpropitious to intere&s;t than de&s;ultory application and un|limited
<PB N="283" REF="284">
enquiry, by which the de&s;ires are held in a perpetual equipoi&s;e, and the mind fluctu|ates between different purpo&s;es without deter|mination. I had books of every kind round me, among which I divided my time as ca|price or accident directed. I often &s;pent the fir&s;t hours of the day, in con&s;idering to what &s;tudy I &s;hould devote the re&s;t; and at la&s;t when I was hara&s;&s;ed with deliberation, &s;natch|ed up any author that lay upon the table, or perhaps, fled to a coffee-hou&s;e for deliverance from the anxiety of irre&s;olution, and the gloomine&s;s of &s;olitude. But, when my atten|tion happened to be vigorous, and my intel|lects unclouded, I ranged from art to art, from writer to writer, and have di&s;tributed a &s;ingle hour among <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom, Galen, Homer, Eu|clid,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tinian.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mean time my little patrimony grew imperceptibly le&s;s till I was at la&s;t rou&s;ed from my literary &s;lumber by the impa|tience of a creditor, who&s;e importunity obli|ged me to pacify him with &s;o large a &s;um that what remained was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport me more than eight months. I hope you will not reproach me with avarice or cowardice
<PB N="284" REF="285">
if I acknowledge that I now thought my&s;elf in danger of di&s;tre&s;s, and obliged to endeavour after &s;ome certain competence.</P>
<P>THERE have been heroes of negligence, who have laid the price of their la&s;t acre in a drawer, and, without the lea&s;t interruption of their tranquillity or abatement of their expen|ces, taken out one piece after another, till there was no more remaining. But I was not born to &s;uch dignity of imprudence, or &s;uch exal|tation above the cares and nece&s;&s;ities of life: I therefore immediately engaged my friends to procure me a little employment, which might &s;et me free from the dread of poverty, and afford me time to plan out &s;ome final &s;cheme of la&s;ting advantage.</P>
<P>MY friends, who&s;e kindne&s;s had never ri&s;en into much &s;olicitude, and who had neither inclination nor opportunity to know the &s;tate of my revenues, were &s;truck with hone&s;t per|turbation at the confe&s;&s;ion of my unea&s;ine&s;s, and immediately promi&s;ed their endeavours for my extrication. They did not &s;uffer their kindne&s;s to langui&s;h by delay, but in the fir&s;t ardour of their zeal pro&s;ecuted their enquiries
<PB N="285" REF="286">
with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s than a month I was perplexed with variety of offers and contrariety of pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>I HAD however no time for long pau&s;es of con&s;ideration; and therefore &s;oon re&s;olved to accept the office of in&s;tructing a young nobleman in the hou&s;e of his father: I went to the &s;eat at which the family then happened to re&s;ide, was received with great politene&s;s, and invited to enter immediately on my charge. The terms offered were &s;uch as I &s;hould willingly have accepted, though my circum&s;tances had allowed me greater liberty of choice: the re&s;pect with which I was treated flattered my vanity; and perhaps, the &s;plen|dor of the apartments, and the luxury of the table, were not wholly without their influ|ence. I immediately complied with the pro|po&s;als, and received the young lord into my care.</P>
<P>HAVING no de&s;ire to gain more than I &s;hould truly de&s;erve, I very diligently pro|&s;ecuted my undertaking, and had the &s;a|tisfaction of di&s;covering in my pupil a flexible temper, a quick apprehen&s;ion, and a retentive
<PB N="286" REF="287">
memory. I did not much doubt that my care would, in time, produce a wi&s;e and u&s;e|ful coun&s;ellor to the &s;tate, though my labours were &s;omewhat ob&s;tructed by want of autho|rity, and the nece&s;&s;ity of complying with the freaks of negligence, and of waiting patiently for the lucky moment of voluntary attention. To a man, who&s;e imagination was filled with the dignity of knowledge, and to whom a &s;tu|dious life had made all the common amu&s;e|ments in&s;ipid and contemptible, it was not very ea&s;y to &s;uppre&s;s his indignation, when he &s;aw him&s;elf for&s;aken in the mid&s;t of his lec|ture, for an opportunity to catch an in&s;ect, and found his in&s;tructions debarred from acce&s;s to the intellectual faculties by the memory of a childi&s;h frolick, or the de&s;ire of a new play-thing.</P>
<P>THOSE vexations, however, would have recurred le&s;s frequently, had not his mamma, by entreating at one time that he &s;hould be excu&s;ed from his ta&s;k as a reward for &s;ome petty compliance, and with-holding him from his book at another to gratify her&s;elf or her vi|&s;itants with his vivacity, &s;hewn him that every thing was more plea&s;ing and more important
<PB N="287" REF="288">
than knowledge, and that &s;tudy was to be endu|red rather than cho&s;en, and was only the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of tho&s;e hours which plea&s;ure left vacant, or di&s;cipline u&s;urped.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it my duty to complain, in tender terms, of the&s;e frequent avocations; but was an&s;wered, that rank and fortune might rea&s;onably hope for &s;ome indulgence; that the retardation of my pupil's progre&s;s would not be imputed to any negligence or inability of mine; and that with the &s;ucce&s;s which &s;atisfied every body el&s;e, I might &s;ure|ly &s;atisfy my&s;elf. I had now done my duty, and without more remon&s;trances, continued to inculcate my precepts whenever they would be heard, gained every day new influence, and found that by degrees my &s;cholar began to feel the quick impul&s;es of curio&s;ity, and the hone&s;t ardour of &s;tudious ambition.</P>
<P>AT length it was re&s;olved to pa&s;s a winter in <HI>London.</HI> The lady had too much fondne&s;s for her &s;on to live five months without him, and too high an opinion of his wit and learning to refu&s;e her vanity the gratification of exhi|biting him to the publick. I remon&s;trated
<PB N="288" REF="289">
again&s;t too early an acquaintance with cards and company; but with a &s;oft contempt of my ignorance and pedantry, &s;he &s;aid that he had been already confined too long to &s;olitary &s;tudy, and it was now time to &s;hew him the world; that nothing was more a brand of meanne&s;s than ba&s;hful timidity; that gay free|dom and elegant a&s;&s;urance were only to be gained by mixed conver&s;ation, a frequent in|tercour&s;e with &s;trangers, and a timely intro|duction to &s;plendid a&s;&s;emblies; and &s;he had more than once ob&s;erved, that his forward|ne&s;s and complai&s;ance began to de&s;ert him, that he was &s;ilent when he had not &s;omething of con&s;equence to &s;ay, blu&s;hed whenever he happened to find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and hung down his head in the pre&s;ence of ladies, with|out that readine&s;s of reply and activity of of|ficiou&s;ne&s;s remarkable in young gentlemen that are bred in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN I found re&s;i&s;tance hopele&s;s, and again therefore I thought it proper to com|ply. We entered the coach, and in four days were placed in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t magnifi|cent region of the town. My pupil, who had for &s;everal years lived at a remote &s;eat,
<PB N="289" REF="290">
was immediately dazzled with a thou&s;and beams of novelty and &s;hew. His imagina|tion was filled with the perpetual tumult of plea&s;ure that pa&s;&s;ed before him, and it was im|po&s;&s;ible to allure him from the window, or to overpower by any charm of eloquence the rattle of coaches, and the &s;ounds which echoed from the doors in the neighbourhood. In three days his attention, which he began to regain, was di&s;turbed by a rich &s;uit, in which he was equipped for the reception of company, and which, having been long accu&s;tomed to a plain dre&s;s, he could not at fir&s;t &s;urvey without ec&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>THE arrival of the family was now for|mally notified; every hour of every day brought more intimate or more di&s;tant ac|quaintance to the door; and my pupil was in|di&s;criminately introduced to all, that he might accu&s;tom him&s;elf to change of faces, and be rid with &s;peed of his ru&s;tick diffidence. He has ea&s;ily endeared him&s;elf to his mother by the &s;peedy acqui&s;ition or recovery of her dar|ling qualities; his eyes &s;parkle at a numerous a&s;&s;embly, and his heart dances at the men|tion of a ball. He has at once caught the
<PB N="290" REF="291">
infection of high life, and has no other te&s;t of principles or actions than the quality of tho&s;e to whom they are a&s;cribed. He begins al|ready to look down on me with &s;uperiority, and &s;ubmits to one &s;hort le&s;&s;on in a week, as an act of conde&s;cen&s;ion rather than obedience, for he is of opinion, that no tutor is properly qualified who cannot &s;peak <HI>French</HI>; and having formerly learned a few familiar phra&s;es from his &s;i&s;ter's governe&s;s, he is every day &s;oliciting his mamma to procure him a foreign footman, that he may grow polite by his conver&s;ation. I am yet not in&s;ulted, but find my&s;elf likely to become &s;oon a &s;uper|fluous incumbrance, for my &s;cholar has now no time for &s;cience, or for virtue; and the lady ye&s;terday declared him &s;o much the fa|vourite of every company, that &s;he was afraid he would not have an hour in the day to dance and fence.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have &s;hewn by the publication of my letter, that you think the life of <HI>Victoria</HI> not wholly unworthy of the notice of a philo&s;opher: I &s;hall therefore continue my narrative, without any apology for unimpor|tance which you have dignified, or for inac|curacies which you are to correct.</P>
<P>WHEN my life appeared to be no longer in danger, and as much of my &s;trength was re|covered as enabled me to bear the agitation of a coach, I was placed at a lodging in a neigh|bouring village, to which my mother di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="292" REF="293">
me with a faint embrace, having repeated her command not to expo&s;e my face too &s;oon to the &s;un or wind, and told me, that with care I might perhaps become tolerable again. The pro&s;pect of being tolerable had very little power to elevate the imagination of one who had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to prai&s;e and ec&s;tacy; but it was &s;ome &s;atisfaction to be &s;e|parated from my mother, who was ince&s;&s;ant|ly ringing the knell of departed beauty, and never entered my room without the whine of condolence, or the growl of anger. She of|ten wandered over my face, as travellers over the ruins of a celebrated city, to note every place which had once been remarkable for a happy feature. She conde&s;cended to vi&s;it my retirement, but always left me more melan|choly; for after a thou&s;and trifling enquiries about my diet, and a minute examination of my looks, &s;he generally concluded with a &s;igh that I &s;hould never more be fit to be &s;een.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t I was permitted to return home, but found no great improvement of my con|dition; for I was impri&s;oned in my chamber as a criminal, who&s;e appearance would di&s;|grace my friends, and condemned to be tor|tured
<PB N="293" REF="294">
into new beauty. Every experiment which the officiou&s;ne&s;s of folly could communicate, or the credulity of ignorance believe, was tri|ed upon me. Sometimes I was covered with emollients, by which it was expected that all the &s;cars would be filled, and my cheeks plumped up to their &s;ormer &s;moothne&s;s; and &s;ometimes I was puni&s;hed with artificial ex|coriations, in hopes of gaining new graces with a new &s;kin. The co&s;metick &s;cience was ex|hau&s;ted upon me; but who can repair the ruins of nature? My mother was forced to give me re&s;t at la&s;t, and abandon me to the fate of a fallen toa&s;t, who&s;e fortune &s;he con|&s;idered as a hopele&s;s game, no longer worthy of &s;olicitude or attention.</P>
<P>THE condition of a young woman who has never thought or heard of any other excellence than beauty, and whom the &s;udden bla&s;t of di&s;|ea&s;e wrinkles in her bloom, is, indeed, &s;uffi|ciently calamitous. She is at once deprived of all that gave her eminence or power; of all that elated her pride, or animated her activity; all that filled her days with plea&s;ure and her nights with hope; all that gave gladne&s;s to the pre&s;ent hour, or brightened her pro&s;pects of
<PB N="294" REF="295">
futurity. It is perhaps, not in the power of a man who&s;e attention has been divided by di|ver&s;ity of pur&s;uits, and who has not been ac|cu&s;tomed to derive from others much of his happine&s;s, to image to him&s;elf &s;uch helple&s;s de&s;titution, &s;uch di&s;mal inanity. Every object of plea&s;ing contemplation, is at once &s;natched away, and the &s;oul finds every receptacle of ideas empty, or filled only with the memory of joys that can return no more. All is gloomy privation, or impotent de&s;ire; the fa|culties of anticipation &s;lumber in de&s;pondency, or the powers of plea&s;ure mutiny for employ|ment.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;o little able to find entertainment for my&s;elf, that I was forced in a &s;hort time to venture abroad, as the &s;olitary &s;avage is driven by hunger from his cavern. I entered with all the humility of di&s;grace into a&s;&s;em|blies, where I had lately &s;parkled with gaiety, and towered with triumph. I was not wholly without hope, that dejection had mi&s;repre|&s;ented me to my&s;elf, and that the remains of my former face might yet have &s;ome attrac|tion and influence: But the fir&s;t circle of vi&s;its convinced me, that my reign was at an end;
<PB N="295" REF="296">
that life and death were no longer in my hands; that I was no more to practi&s;e the glance of command, or the frown of prohi|bition, to receive the tribute of &s;ighs and prai&s;es, or be &s;oothed with the gentle mur|murs of amorous timidity. My opinion was now unheard, and my propo&s;als were unregard|ed; the narrowne&s;s of my knowledge, and the meanne&s;s of my &s;entiments, were ea&s;ily di&s;co|vered, when the eyes were no longer engaged again&s;t the judgment; and it was ob&s;erved, by tho&s;e who had formerly been charmed with my vivacious loquacity, that my under&s;tand|ing was impaired as well as my face, and that I was no longer qualified to fill a place in any company but a party at cards.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely to be imagined how &s;oon the mind &s;inks to a level with the condition. I, who had long con&s;idered all who approached me as va&s;&s;als condemned to regulate their plea&s;ures by my eyes, and hara&s;s their inven|tions for my entertainment, was in le&s;s than three weeks reduced to receive a ticket with profe&s;&s;ions of obligation; to catch with eager|ne&s;s at a compliment; and to watch with all the anxiou&s;ne&s;s of dependance, le&s;t any little
<PB N="296" REF="297">
civility that was paid me &s;hould pa&s;s unac|knowledged.</P>
<P>THOUGH the negligence of the men was not very plea&s;ing when compared with vows and adoration, yet it was far more &s;upport|able than the in&s;olence of my own &s;ex. For the fir&s;t ten months after my return into the world, I never entered a &s;ingle hou&s;e in which the memory of my downfal was not revived. At one place I was congratulated on my e&s;|cape with life; at another I heard of the be|nefits of early inoculation; by &s;ome I have been told in expre&s;s terms, that I am yet not without my charms; others have whi&s;pered at my entrance, This is the celebrated beauty. One told me of a wa&s;h that would &s;mooth the &s;kin; and another offered me her chair that I might not front the light. Some &s;oothed me with the ob&s;ervation that none can tell how &s;oon my ca&s;e may be her own; and &s;ome thought it proper to receive me with mournful tenderne&s;s, formal condolence, and con&s;olatory blandi&s;hments.</P>
<P>THUS was I every day hara&s;&s;ed with all the &s;tratagems of well-bred malignity; yet in&s;o|lence
<PB N="297" REF="298">
was more tolerable than &s;olitude, and I therefore per&s;i&s;ted to keep my time at the doors of my acquaintance, without gratifying them with any appearance of re&s;entment or depre&s;&s;ion. I expected that their exultation would in time vapour away; that the joy of their &s;uperiority would end with its novelty; and that I &s;hould be &s;uffered to glide along in my pre&s;ent form among the namele&s;s multi|tude whom nature never intended to excite envy or admiration, nor enabled to delight the eye or inflame the heart.</P>
<P>THIS was naturally to be expected, and this I began to experience. But when I was no longer agitated by the perpetual ardour of re|&s;i&s;tance and effort of per&s;everance, I found more &s;en&s;ibly the want of tho&s;e entertainments which had formerly delighted me; the day ro&s;e upon me without an engagement, and the evening clo&s;ed in its natural gloom, with|out &s;ummoning me to a concert or a ball. None had any care to find amu&s;ements for me, and I had no power of amu&s;ing my&s;elf. Idlene&s;s expo&s;ed me to melancholy, and life began to langui&s;h in motionle&s;s indiffer|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
MISERY and &s;hame are nearly allied. It was not without many &s;truggles that I pre|vailed on my&s;elf to confe&s;s my unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Euphemia,</HI> the only friend who had never pained me with comfort or with pity. I at la&s;t laid my calamities before her, rather to ea&s;e my heart than receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance. "We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;aid &s;he, my <HI>Victoria,</HI> tho&s;e evils which are impo&s;ed by provi|dence, from tho&s;e to which we our&s;elves give the power of hurting us. Of your calamity, a &s;mall part is the infliction of heaven, the re&s;t is little more than the cor|ro&s;ion of idle di&s;content. You have lo&s;t that which may indeed &s;ometimes contri|bute to happine&s;s, but to which happine&s;s is by no means in&s;eparably annexed. You have lo&s;t what the greater number of the human race never have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; what tho&s;e on whom it is be&s;towed for the mo&s;t part po&s;&s;e&s;s in vain; and what you, while it was yours, knew not how to u&s;e: You have only lo&s;t early what the laws of nature for|bid you to keep long, and have lo&s;t it while your mind is yet flexible, and while you have time to &s;ub&s;titute more valuable and
<PB N="299" REF="300">
more durable excellencies. Con&s;ider your|&s;elf, my <HI>Victoria,</HI> as a being born to know, to rea&s;on, and to act; ri&s;e at once from your dream of melancholy to wi&s;dom and to piety; you will find that there are other charms than tho&s;e of beauty, and other joys than the prai&s;e of fools."</P>

<P>I Sat ye&s;terday morning employed in deli|berating on which, among the various &s;ubjects that occurred to my imagination, I &s;hould be&s;tow the paper of to-day. After a &s;hort effort of meditation which by nothing was determined, I grew every moment more irre&s;olute, my ideas wandered from the fir&s;t intention, and I rather wi&s;hed to think, than thought, upon any &s;ettled &s;ubject; till at la&s;t I was awakened from this dream of &s;tudy by a &s;ummons from the pre&s;s: the time was come for which I had been thus negligently purpo&s;ing to provide, and, however dubious or &s;luggi&s;h, I was now nece&s;&s;itated to write.</P>
<P>THOUGH to a writer who&s;e de&s;ign is &s;o
<PB N="301" REF="302">
comprehen&s;ive and mi&s;cellaneous, that he may accommodate him&s;elf with a topick from every &s;cene of life, or view of nature, it is no great aggravation of his ta&s;k to be obliged to a &s;udden compo&s;ition, yet I could not forbear to reproach my&s;elf for having &s;o long neglect|ed what was unavoidably to be done, and of which every moment's idlene&s;s increa&s;ed the difficulty. There was however &s;ome plea&s;ure in reflecting that I, who had only trifled till diligence was nece&s;&s;ary, might &s;till congra|tulate my&s;elf upon my &s;uperiority to multi|tudes, who have trifled till diligence is vain; who can by no degree of activity or re&s;olu|tion recover the opportunities which have &s;lipped away; and who are condemned by their own carele&s;ne&s;s to hopele&s;s calamity and barren &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THE folly of allowing our&s;elves to delay what we know cannot be finally e&s;caped, is one of the general weakne&s;&s;es, which in &s;pite of the in&s;truction of morali&s;ts, and the remon|&s;trances of rea&s;on, prevail to a greater or le&s;s degree in almo&s;t every mind: even they who mo&s;t &s;teadily with&s;tand it, find it, if not the mo&s;t violent, the mo&s;t pertinacious of their
<PB N="302" REF="303">
pa&s;&s;ions, always renewing its attacks, and though often vanqui&s;hed, never de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>IT is indeed natural to have particular re|gard to the time pre&s;ent, and to be mo&s;t &s;oli|citous for that which is by its nearne&s;s enabled to make the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. When therefore any &s;harp pain is to be &s;uffered, or any formidable danger to be incurred, we can &s;carcely exempt our&s;elves wholly from the &s;educements of imagination; we readily be|lieve that another day will bring &s;ome &s;upport or advantage which we now want; and are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, that the moment of nece&s;&s;ity which we de&s;ire never to arrive, is at a great di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>THUS life is langui&s;hed away in the gloom of anxiety, and con&s;umed in collecting re&s;o|lution which the next morning di&s;&s;ipates; in forming purpo&s;es which we &s;carcely hope to keep; and reconciling our&s;elves to our own cowardice by excu&s;es, which, while we ad|mit them, we know to be ab&s;urd. Our firm|ne&s;s is by the continual contemplation of mi|&s;ery hourly impaired; every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our fear enlarges its dominion; we not only wa&s;te
<PB N="303" REF="304">
that time in which the evil we dread might have been &s;uffered and &s;urmounted, but even where procra&s;tination produces no ab&s;olute encrea&s;e of our difficulties, make them le&s;s &s;uperable to our&s;elves by habitual terrors. When evils cannot be avoided, it is wi&s;e to contract the interval of expectation; to meet the mi&s;chiefs which will overtake us if we fly; and &s;uffer only their real malignity without the conflicts of doubt and angui&s;h of anticipa|tion.</P>
<P>TO act is far ea&s;ier than to &s;uffer, yet we every day &s;ee the progre&s;s of life retarded by the <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> the mere repugnance to mo|tion, and find multitudes repining at the want of that which nothing but idlene&s;s hinders them from enjoying. The ca&s;e of <HI>Tantalus,</HI> in the region of poetick puni&s;hment, was &s;omewhat to be pitied, becau&s;e the fruits that hung about him retired from his hand; but what tenderne&s;s can be claimed by tho&s;e who though perhaps they &s;uffer the pains of <HI>Tanta|lus</HI> will never lift their hands for their own re|lief?</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more common among
<PB N="304" REF="305">
this torpid generation than murmurs and com|plaints; murmurs at unea&s;ine&s;s which only vacancy and &s;u&s;picion expo&s;e them to feel, and complaints of di&s;tre&s;&s;es which it is in their own power to remove. Lazine&s;s is commonly a&s;&s;ociated with timidity. Either fear originally prohibits endeavours by infu&s;ing de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s; or the frequent failure of irre&s;olute &s;truggles, and the con&s;tant de&s;ire of avoiding labour, impre&s;s by degrees fal&s;e ter|rors on the mind. But fear, whether natu|ral or acquired, when once it has full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the fancy never fails to employ it up|on vi&s;ions of calamity, &s;uch as if they are not &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated by u&s;eful employment, will &s;oon overca&s;t it with horrors, and imbitter life not only with tho&s;e mi&s;eries by which all earthly beings are really more or le&s;s tormented, but with tho&s;e which do not yet exi&s;t, and which can only be di&s;cerned by the per&s;picacity of cowardice.</P>
<P>AMONG all who &s;acrifice future advant|age to pre&s;ent inclination, &s;carcely any gain &s;o little as tho&s;e that &s;uffer them&s;elves to freeze in idlene&s;s. Others are corrupted by &s;ome enjoyment of more or le&s;s power to
<PB N="305" REF="306">
gratify the pa&s;&s;ions; but to neglect our duties, merely to avoid the labour of performing them, a labour which is always punctually re|warded, is &s;urely to &s;ink under weak temp|tations. Idlene&s;s never can &s;ecure tran|quillity; the call of rea&s;on and of con&s;cience will pierce the clo&s;e&s;t pavilion of the &s;luggard, and, though it may not have force to drive him from his down, will be loud enough to hinder him from &s;leep. Tho&s;e moments which he cannot re&s;olve to make u&s;eful by devoting them to the great bu&s;ine&s;s of his be|ing, will &s;till be u&s;urped by powers that will not leave them to his di&s;po&s;al; remor&s;e and vexation will &s;eize upon them, and forbid him to enjoy what he is &s;o de&s;irous to appro|priate.</P>
<P>THERE are other cau&s;es of inactivity in|cident to more active faculties and more acute di&s;cernment. He to whom many objects of per&s;uit ari&s;e at the &s;ame time, will frequently he&s;itate between different de&s;ires, till a rival has precluded him, or change his cour&s;e as new attractions prevail, and hara&s;s him&s;elf without advancing. He who &s;ees different ways to the &s;ame end, will, unle&s;s he
<PB N="306" REF="307">
watches carefully over his own conduct, lay out too much of his attention upon the com|pari&s;on of probabilities, and the adju&s;tment of expedients, and pau&s;e in the choice of his road, till &s;ome accident intercepts his journey. He who&s;e penetration extends to remote con&s;e|quences, and who, whenever he applies his attention to any de&s;ign, di&s;covers new pro|&s;pects of advantage, and new po&s;&s;ibilities of improvement, will not ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded that his project is ripe for execution; but will &s;u|peradd one contrivance to another, endeavour to unite various purpo&s;es in one operation, multiply complications, and refine niceties, till he is entangled in his own &s;cheme, and bewildered in the perplexity of various inten|tions. He will re&s;olve to unite all the beau|ties of &s;ituation in a new purcha&s;e, and wa&s;te his life in roving to no purpo&s;e from province to province. He will hope in the &s;ame hou&s;e to obtain every convenience, and draw plans and &s;tudy <HI>Palladio,</HI> but never lay a &s;tone. He will attempt a treati&s;e on &s;ome important &s;ubject, and ama&s;s materials, con&s;ult au|thors, and &s;tudy all the dependent and colla|teral parts of learning, but never con|clude him&s;elf qualified to write. He that has
<PB N="307" REF="308">
abilities to conceive perfection, will not ea&s;ily be content without it; and &s;ince perfection cannot be reached, will lo&s;e the opportunity of doing well in the vain hope of unattain|able excellence.</P>
<P>THE certainty that life cannot be long, and the probability that it will be much &s;horter than nature allows, ought to awaken every man to the active pro&s;ecution of whatever he is de&s;irous to perform. It is true that no dili|gence can a&s;certain &s;ucce&s;s; death may inter|cept the &s;wifte&s;t career; but he who is cut off in the execution of an hone&s;t undertaking, has at lea&s;t the honour of falling in his rank, and has fought the battle, though he mi&s;&s;ed the victory.</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to take a view on any &s;ide, or ob&s;erve any of the various cla&s;&s;es that form the great community of the world, without di&s;covering &s;ome proof of the in|fluence of example; and admitting with new conviction and in a &s;en&s;e more exten&s;ive the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Ar&s;totle,</HI> that <HI>man is an imitative being.</HI> The greater, far the greater, number follow the track which others have beaten, without any curio&s;ity after new di&s;|coveries, or ambition of tru&s;ting them&s;elves to their own conduct. And, of tho&s;e whom the confidence of juvenile temerity incites to break the ranks and di&s;order the uniformity of the march, mo&s;t return in a &s;hort time from their deviation, and prefer the equal and &s;teady &s;atisfaction of &s;ecurity before the frolicks of caprice and the honours of adventure.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="310">
IN que&s;tions difficult or dangerous it is in|deed natural to repo&s;e upon authority, and, when fear happens to predominate, upon the authority of tho&s;e whom we do not in general think wi&s;er than our&s;elves. Very few have abilities requi&s;ite for the di&s;covery of ab&s;tru&s;e truth; and of tho&s;e few &s;ome want lei&s;ure and &s;ome re&s;olution, &s;ome are drawn off from the &s;earch by bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ements, and &s;ome retire at the appearance of difficulty. But it is not &s;o ea&s;y to find the rea&s;on of the univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to precedent where every man might &s;afely judge for him&s;elf; where no irre|reparable lo&s;s can be hazarded, nor any mi&s;|chief of long continuance incurred. Vanity might be expected to operate on tho&s;e who are not re&s;trained by any more powerful pa&s;|&s;ion; the mere plea&s;ure of acknowledging no &s;uperior might &s;ometimes produce &s;light &s;in|gularities, or the hope of gaining &s;ome new degree of happine&s;s awaken the mind to in|vention or experiment.</P>
<P>IF in any ca&s;e the &s;hackles of pre&s;cription could be wholly &s;haken off, and the imagina|tion left to act without controul, on what oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="310" REF="311">
&s;hould it be expected, but in the &s;elec|tion of lawful plea&s;ure? Plea&s;ure, of which the e&s;&s;ence is choice; which compul&s;ion di&s;&s;o|ciates from every thing to which nature has united it; and which owes not only its vigour but its being to the &s;miles of liberty. Yet we &s;ee that the &s;en&s;es, as well as the rea&s;on, are regulated by credulity; and that mo&s;t will feel, or &s;ay that they feel, the gratifications which others have taught them to expect.</P>
<P>AT this time of univer&s;al migration, when almo&s;t every one, confiderable enough to at|tract regard, has retired, or is preparing with all the earne&s;tne&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s to retire, into the country; when nothing is to be heard but the hopes of &s;peedy departure, or the complaints of involuntary delay; I have often been tempt|ed to enquire what happine&s;s to be gained, or what inconvenience to be avoided, by this &s;tated rece&s;&s;ion. Of the birds of pa&s;&s;age, &s;ome follow the &s;ummer, and &s;ome the win|ter, becau&s;e they live upon &s;u&s;tenance which only &s;ummer or winter can &s;upply; but of the annual flight of human rovers it is much har|der to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on, becau&s;e they do not appear either to find or &s;eek any thing which
<PB N="311" REF="312">
is not equally afforded by the town and coun|try.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, that many of the&s;e fugitives may have heard of men who&s;e continual wi&s;h was for the quiet of retirement, who watched every opportunity to &s;teal away from ob&s;ervation, to for&s;ake the croud, and delight them&s;elves with <HI>the &s;ociety of &s;olitude.</HI> There is indeed &s;carcely any writer who has not celebrated the happine&s;s of rural privacy, and delighted him&s;elf and his reader with the melody of birds, the whi&s;per of groves, and the murmur of rivulets; nor any man emi|nent for extent of capacity, or greatne&s;s of exploits that has not left behind him &s;ome me|morials of lonely wi&s;dom, and &s;ilent dignity.</P>
<P>BUT almo&s;t all ab&s;urdity of conduct ari&s;es from the imitation of tho&s;e whom we cannot re&s;emble. Tho&s;e who thus te&s;tified their wearine&s;s of tumult and hurry, and ha&s;ted with &s;o much eagerne&s;s to the lei&s;ure of re|treat, were either men overwhelmed with the pre&s;&s;ure of difficult employments, hara&s;&s;ed with importunities, and di&s;tracted with mul|tiplicity; or men wholly engro&s;&s;ed by &s;pecu|lative
<PB N="312" REF="313">
&s;ciences, who having no other end of life but to learn and teach, found their &s;earches interrupted by the common commerce of ci|vility, and their rea&s;onings disjointed by fre|quent interruptions. Such men might rea|&s;onably fly to that ea&s;e and convenience which their condition allowed them to find only in the country. The &s;tate&s;man who devoted the greater part of his time to the publick, was de&s;irous of keeping the remain|der in his own power; the general ruffled with dangers, wearied with labours, and &s;tunned with acclamations, gladly &s;natched an interval of &s;ilence and relaxation; the naturali&s;t was unhappy where the works of providence were not always before him; the rea&s;oner could adju&s;t his &s;y&s;tems only where his mind was free from the intru&s;ion of outward objects.</P>
<P>SUCH examples of &s;olitude very few of tho&s;e who are now ha&s;tening from the town, have any preten&s;ions to plead in their own ju&s;tification, &s;ince they cannot pretend either weariue&s;s of labour, or de&s;ire of knowledge. They purpo&s;e nothing more than to quit one &s;cene of idlene&s;s for another, and after having trifled in publick to &s;leep in &s;ecrecy. The
<PB N="313" REF="314">
utmo&s;t that they can hope to gain is the change of ridiculou&s;ne&s;s to ob&s;curity, and the privilege of having fewer witne&s;&s;es to a life of folly. He who is not &s;ufficiently important to be di&s;turbed in his pur&s;uits, but &s;pends all his hours according to his own inclination, and has more hours than his mental faculties ena|ble him to fill either with enjoyment or de|&s;ires, can have nothing to demand of &s;hades and valleys. As bravery is &s;aid to be a pan|oply, in&s;ignificancy is always a &s;helter.</P>
<P>THERE are however plea&s;ures and advan|tages in a rural &s;ituation, which are not con|fined to philo&s;ophers and heroes. The fre&s;h|ne&s;s of the air, the verdure of the woods, the paint of the meadows, and the unexhau&s;ted variety which &s;ummer &s;catters upon the earth, may ea&s;ily give delight to an unlearned &s;pec|tator. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that he who looks with plea&s;ure on the colours of a flower &s;hould &s;tudy the principles of vegetation, or that the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> and <HI>Copernican</HI> &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be compared before the light of the &s;un can glad|den, or its warmth invigorate. Novelty is it&s;elf a &s;ource of gratification, and <HI>Milton</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that to him who has been long
<PB N="314" REF="315">
pent up in cities no rural object can be pre|&s;ented, which will not gladden &s;ome of his &s;en&s;es with refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>YET even the&s;e ea&s;y plea&s;ures are mi&s;&s;ed by the greater part of tho&s;e who wa&s;te their &s;ummer in the country. Should any man pur&s;ue his acquaintances to their retreats, he would find few of them li&s;tening to <HI>Philomel,</HI> loitering in woods, or plucking dai&s;ies, catch|ing the healthy gale of the morning, or watch+ing the gentle coru&s;cations of declining day. Some will be di&s;covered at a window by the road &s;ide, rejoicing when a new cloud of du&s;t gathers towards them, as at the approach of a momentary &s;upply of conver&s;ation, and a &s;hort relief from the tediou&s;ne&s;s of unideal vacancy. Others are placed in the adjacent villages, where they look only upon hou&s;es as in the re&s;t of the year, with no change of objects but what a remove to any new &s;treet in <HI>London</HI> might have given them. The &s;ame &s;et of acquaintances &s;till &s;ettle together, and the form of life is not otherwi&s;e diver&s;ified than by doing the &s;ame things in a different place. They pay and receive vi&s;its in the u&s;ual form, they frequent the walks in the
<PB N="315" REF="316">
morning, they deal cards at night, they attend to the &s;ame tattle, and dance with the &s;ame partners; nor can they at their return to their former habitation congratulate them|&s;elves on any other advantage, than that they have pa&s;&s;ed their time like others of the &s;ame rank; and have the &s;ame right to talk of the happine&s;s and beauty of the country, of hap|pine&s;s which they never felt, and beauty which they never regarded.</P>
<P>TO be able to procure its own entertain|ments, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon its own &s;tock, is not the prerogative of every mind. There are indeed under&s;tandings &s;o fertile and compre|hen&s;ive, that they can always feed reflection with new &s;upplies, and &s;uffer nothing from the preclu&s;ion of adventitious amu&s;ements; as &s;ome cities have within their own walls en|clo&s;ed ground enough to feed their inhabitants in a &s;iege. But others live only from day to day, and mu&s;t be con&s;tantly enabled, by fo|reign &s;upplies, to keep out the encroachments of languor and &s;tupidity. Such could not in|deed be blamed for hovering within reach of their u&s;ual plea&s;ures, more than any other animal for not quitting its native element,

were not their faculties contracted by their own fault. But let not tho&s;e who go into the country, merely becau&s;e they dare not be left alone at home, boa&s;t their love of na|ture, or their qualifications for &s;olitude; nor pretend that they receive in&s;tantaneous in|fu&s;ions of wi&s;dom from the <HI>Dryads,</HI> and are able, when they leave &s;moke and noi&s;e be|hind, to act, or think, or rea&s;on for them|&s;elves.</P>

<P>THE regard which they who&s;e abilities are employed in the works of imagi|nation claim from the re&s;t of mankind ari&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from their influence on fu|turity. Rank may be con&s;erred by princes, and wealth bequeathed by mi&s;ers or by rob|bers; but the honours of a la&s;ting name and a title to the veneration of di&s;tant ages only the &s;ons of learning have the power of be&s;tow|ing.
<PB N="317" REF="318">
While therefore the love of fame is a motive of action, while it continues one of the characteri&s;ticks of rational nature to de|cline oblivion, authors never can be wholly overlooked in the &s;earch after happine&s;s, nor become contemptible but by their own fault.</P>
<P>THE man who con&s;iders him&s;elf as con&s;ti|tuted the ultimate judge of di&s;putable cha|racters, as entru&s;ted with the di&s;tribution of the la&s;t terre&s;trial rewards of merit, ought &s;urely to &s;ummon all his fortitude to the &s;up|port of his integrity, and re&s;olve to di&s;charge an office of &s;uch dignity and importance with the mo&s;t vigilant caution and &s;crupulous ju&s;|tice. To deliver examples to po&s;terity, and to regulate the opinion of future times, is no &s;light or trivial undertaking; nor is it ea&s;y to commit more atrocious trea&s;on again&s;t the great republick of humanity, than by fal&s;ify|ing its records and mi&s;guiding its decrees.</P>
<P>TO &s;catter prai&s;e or blame without regard to ju&s;tice, is to de&s;troy the di&s;tinction of good and evil. Many have no other te&s;t of actions than general opinion; and all are &s;o far influ|enced
<PB N="318" REF="319">
by a &s;en&s;e of reputation, that they are often re&s;trained by fear of reproach, and ex|cited by hope of honour, when other princi|ples have lo&s;t their power; nor can any &s;pe|cies of pro&s;titution promote general depravity more than that which de&s;troys the value of prai&s;e, by &s;hewing that it may be acquired without de&s;erving it, and, which by &s;etting free the active and ambitious who mu&s;t always determine the fate of others, from the dread of infamy, lets loo&s;e the rapacity of power, and weakens the only authority by which greatne&s;s is controlled.</P>
<P>PRAISE, like gold and diamonds, owes its value only to its &s;carcity. It mu&s;t become cheap as it becomes vulgar, and will no lon|ger rai&s;e expectation, or animate enterprize. It is therefore not only nece&s;&s;ary, that wick|edne&s;s, even when it is not &s;afe to cen&s;ure it, be denied applau&s;e, but that goodne&s;s be com|mended only in proportion to its degree; and that the garlands, due to the great benefactors of mankind, be not &s;uffered to fade upon the brow of him who can boa&s;t only petty &s;er|vices and ea&s;y virtues.</P>
<P>HAD the&s;e maxims been univer&s;ally re|ceived
<PB N="319" REF="320">
how much would have been added to the ta&s;k of dedication, the work on which all the power of modern wit has been exhau&s;t|ed. How few of the&s;e initial panegyricks had appeared, if the author had been obliged fir&s;t to find a man of virtue, then to know the di|&s;tinct &s;pecies and degree of his de&s;ert, and at la&s;t to pay him only the honours which he might ju&s;tly claim. It is much ea&s;ier to learn the name of the la&s;t man whom chance has exalted to wealth and power, to obtain by the intervention of &s;ome of his dome&s;ticks the privilege of addre&s;&s;ing him, or to venture on an addre&s;s without any previous &s;olicita|tion in confidence of the general acceptance of flattery; and after having heaped upon him all the virtues to which philo&s;ophy has a&s;&s;ign|ed a name, inform him how much more might be truly &s;aid, did not the fear of giving pain to his mode&s;ty repre&s;s the raptures of wonder and the zeal of veneration.</P>
<P>NOTHING has &s;o much degraded litera|ture from its natural rank, as the practice of indecent and promi&s;cuous dedication; for what credit can he expect who profe&s;&s;es him|&s;elf the hireling of vanity, however profligate,
<PB N="320" REF="321">
and without &s;hame or &s;cruple celebrates the worthle&s;s, dignifies the mean, and gives to the corrupt licentious and oppre&s;&s;ive the ornaments which ought only to add grace to truth and loveline&s;s to innocence? Every other kind of fraud or adulteration, however &s;hameful, however mi&s;chievous, is certainly far le&s;s dete&s;table than the crime of counter|feiting characters, and fixing the &s;tamp of li|terary &s;anction, upon the dro&s;s and refu&s;e of the world.</P>
<P>I WOULD not, yet overwhelm the au|thors with the whole load of infamy, of which part, perhaps the greater part, ought to fall upon their patrons. If he that hires a bravo partakes the guilt of murder, why &s;hould he who bribes a flatterer hope to be exempted from the &s;hame of fal&s;hood? The unhappy dedicator is &s;eldom without &s;ome motives which ob&s;truct, though not de&s;troy the liberty of choice; he is perhaps oppre&s;&s;ed by mi&s;eries which he hopes to relieve, or infla|med by ambition which he expects to gratify. But the patron has no incitements equally violent; he can receive only a &s;hort gratifica|tion, with which nothing but &s;tupidity could
<PB N="321" REF="322">
di&s;po&s;e him to be plea&s;ed. The real &s;atisfac|tion which prai&s;e can afford is by repeating aloud the whi&s;pers of con&s;cience, and by &s;hewing us that we have not endeavoured to de&s;erve well in vain. Every other enco|mium is, to an intelligent mind, &s;atire and re|proach; the celebration of the&s;e virtues which we feel our&s;elves to want, can only impre&s;s a quicker &s;en&s;e of our own defects, and &s;hew that we have not yet &s;atisfied the expectations of the world, by forcing us to ob&s;erve how much fiction mu&s;t contribute to the comple|tion of our character.</P>
<P>YET perhaps the patron him&s;elf may have &s;ome claim to indulgence; for it does not al|ways happen, that the encomia&s;t has been much encouraged to his attempt. Many a haple&s;s author, when his book, and perhaps his dedication, was ready for the pre&s;s, has waited long before any one would pay the price of pro&s;titution, or con&s;ent to hear the prai&s;es de&s;tined to in&s;ure his name again&s;t the ca&s;ualties of time; and many a complaint has been vented again&s;t the de|cline of learning, and neglect of genius, when either par&s;imonious prudence had de|clined
<PB N="322" REF="323">
expence, or hone&s;t indignation reject|ed fal&s;hood. But if at la&s;t, after long enquiry and innumerable di&s;appointments, he finds a lord willing to hear of his own eloquence and ta&s;te, a &s;tate&s;man de&s;irous of knowing how a friendly hi&s;torian will repre&s;ent his conduct, or a lady delighted to leave to the world &s;ome memorial of her wit and beauty, &s;uch weak|ne&s;s cannot be cen&s;ured as an in&s;tance of en|ormous depravity. It can &s;carcely be expected but the wi&s;e&s;t man may by a diligent &s;olicitor be &s;urpri&s;ed in the hour of weakne&s;s, and per|&s;uaded to &s;olace vexation, or invigorate hope with the mu&s;ick of flattery.</P>
<P>TO cen&s;ure all dedications as adulatory and &s;ervile, would di&s;cover rather envy than ju&s;|tice. Prai&s;e is the tribute of merit, and he that has inconte&s;tably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by any publick performance, has a right to all the honours which the publick can be&s;tow. To men thus rai&s;ed above the re&s;t of the com|munity, there is no need that the book or its author &s;hould have any particular relation: that the patron is known to de&s;erve re&s;pect, is &s;ufficient to vindicate him that pays it. To the &s;ame regard from particular per&s;ons pri|vate
<PB N="323" REF="324">
virtue and le&s;s con&s;picuous excellence may be &s;ometimes entitled. An author may with great propriety in&s;cribe his work to him by who&s;e encouragement it was undertaken, or by who&s;e liberality he has been enabled to pro&s;ecute it; and may ju&s;tly rejoice in his own fortitude when he dares to re&s;cue merit from ob&s;curity. <Q><L>Acribus exemplis videor te cludere: mi&s;ce</L>
<L>Ergo aliquid no&s;tris de moribus.&mdash;</L></Q> I know not whether greater relaxation may not be indulged, and whether hope as well as gratitude may not unblameably produce a de|dication; but let the writer who pours out his prai&s;es only to propitiate power, or at|tract the attention of greatne&s;s, be cautious le&s;t his de&s;ire betray him to exuberant eulo|gies. We are naturally more apt to plea&s;e our&s;elves with the future than the pa&s;t, and while we luxuriate in expectation, may be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to purcha&s;e what we yet rate only by imagination, at a higher price than experience will warrant.</P>
<P>BUT no private views or per&s;onal regard can di&s;charge any man from his general obli|gations
<PB N="324" REF="325">
to virtue and to truth. It may hap|pen in the various combinations of life that a good man may receive favours from one who, notwith&s;tanding his accidental beneficence, cannot be ju&s;tly propo&s;ed to the imitation of others, and whom, therefore, he mu&s;t find &s;ome other way of rewarding than by publick celebrations. Self-love has indeed many pow|ers of &s;educement, but it &s;urely ought not to exalt us to equality with the collective body of mankind, or per&s;uade us that a benefit con|ferred on us is equivalent to every other vir|tue. Yet many upon fal&s;e principles of gra|titude have ventured to extol wretches whom all but their dependents numbered among the reproaches of the &s;pecies, and whom they would likewi&s;e have beheld with the &s;ame &s;corn had they not been hired to di&s;hone&s;t approbation.</P>
<P>TO encourage merit with prai&s;e is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of literature; but prai&s;e mu&s;t lo&s;e its influence, by unju&s;t or negligent di&s;tribution; and he that impairs its value may be charged with mi&s;application of the power that genius puts into his hands, and with &s;quandering on guilt the recompence of virtue.</P>
