Tempe&s;t; In that Comedy, new
PERSONAGES are introduced; for
whom, he thinks, the Poet has in|vented

<PB REF="3">
<HI>Matter.</HI> True it al&s;o is, that <NOTE PLACE="foot" N="&dagger;">See <HI>DION. HALICARN</HI>: who admires him on that Ac|count.</NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI> u&s;ed the
mo&s;t ru&s;tick Words, drawn from the <HI>Beotians</HI>;
<HI>Virgil,</HI> from <HI>Ennius,</HI> in his HEROICKS, render'd his
Language uncommon; <HI>Milton, Shake&s;pear, Spen|cer,</HI>
and our contemporary <HI>Pa&s;toral Writers,</HI> by
reviving the antiquated <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> terms, by chu&s;ing
and culling the fine&s;t Words of our Glorious AN|CESTORS.
In the Steps of the&s;e, our Swain has
ventur'd to tread; and where the Phra&s;e in u&s;e
was not &s;uited to the &s;oftne&s;s and &s;implicity of
his CHARACTERS, as he is acquainted with the
Dialect of mo&s;t Counties in <HI>England,</HI> has from
thence drawn the tendere&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, as he
thought, and be&s;t adapted to the &s;implicity of his
&s;entiments. Induced, I &s;uppo&s;e, to take the&s;e
Liberties in Pa&s;toral, by what that excellent
Judge of Poetry Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> has laid down on
that Poem. How beautiful, &s;ays he, is the old
Pa&s;toral BALLAD, beginning thus,
<Q><L><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Guardians.</HI> N: 22, 23, 30 and 40.</NOTE> <HI>RAGER</HI> go vetch tha <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or Cows.</NOTE> Kee, or el&s;e tha Zun</L>
<L>Will quite be go, be vore c'have half a don.</L></Q>
And into Language how much finer than the Au|thor's,
has he turn'd a Thought of <HI>Virgil.</HI>
<Q><PB REF="4"><L>And what that hight, which girds the Welkin &s;heen,</L>
<L>Where twelve gay Signs in meet array are &s;een.</L></Q>
This great Man adds, that by imitating the ru|&s;ticity
of the <HI>Dorick,</HI> by the help of the old ob&s;o|lete
<HI>Roman</HI> Language, <HI>Virgil</HI> might have attain'd
as much of the Air of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> as <HI>Phillips</HI> hath
that of <HI>Spencer,</HI> by u&s;ing the antiquated ENGLISH.</P>
<P>Fewer Old-words, indeed, has our pre&s;ent Wri|ter
admitted, than are found, either in <HI>Spencer,</HI> or
the incomparable <HI>Pa&s;torals</HI> of Mr: <HI>Phillips</HI>: But in
return, has often made u&s;e of tho&s;e once introdu|ced.
As his CHARACTERS are particularly &s;imple
and tender, much al&s;o has he imitated <HI>Spencer</HI>'s
manner, of changing the vulgar dre&s;s, as 'twere,
of his Words, yet leaving the Main Body &s;o as to
be known. <HI>Homer</HI>'s manner of performing this
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;hows in the 21 Chap. of his <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI>:
He u&s;ed for <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">; and for
<GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>&amp;c. Virgil</HI> did it, by changing
ILLI into OLLI, and the like. <HI>Milton</HI> by altering
HERMIT into EREMITE; ENTERPRIZE into EM|PRIZE,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Spencer</HI> by affixing <HI>y</HI> and <HI>a</HI> before,
and <HI>en, et, ie,</HI> after his Words; which gives an
inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;oftne&s;s to, without hiding the Lan|guage.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
This Liberty every good heroick Writer has ta|ken;
And well knew <HI>Spencer,</HI> that Pa&s;toral &s;till
more required it. He has given us, in his <HI>Fairy-Queen,</HI>
a new Language: The rea&s;on mu&s;t be, be|cau&s;e
his Scene lyes in a new Place. But how
much more has he done it in his Pa&s;torals.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other places, in the Preface to her <HI>HOMER.</HI></NOTE> <HI>D'acier,</HI> and many Frenchmen, complain of
the penury and &s;tiffne&s;s of their Language, thro'
the want of this. And Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> ob&s;erves, that
the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> did the like. Yet mu&s;t I con|fe&s;s, that even among the Pa&s;toral Writers, no
one but <HI>Theocritus, Spencer,</HI> and our pre&s;ent <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Swains, dur&s;t ever venture them&s;elves in this Pa|&s;toral Path,
being affraid and unwilling to forgo
that Honour which either a refin'd Language or
a &s;ublime one procures: But then mu&s;t we add,
that from thence it is, that no Critick, but who
dares not &s;tir a &s;tep without Leading-&s;trings, as
<HI>Scaliger, Rapin,</HI> &amp;c, has ever allow'd any el&s;e to
be Pa&s;toral Writers.</P>
<P>But is any One di&s;&s;atisfied with our rural STILE,
read he a full Vindication of one much more &s;o:
&s;uch he'll find before <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Folio Edition.</NOTE> <HI>Spencer</HI>'s Pa&s;torals; and
by his Friend Mr. <HI>Harvey.</HI> For who knows not,
<PB REF="6">
that his Language was equally uncommon in his
Day, and in <HI>Our</HI>'s; Our TONGUE receiving no vi|&s;ible
Alteration in one hundred Years. This ap|pears
from <HI>Ben. John&s;on, Hooker, Our Common-Prayer Book,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Reader will ob&s;erve I here only bring &s;ome
few <HI>Authorities</HI>; The rea&s;on that I my &s;elf de|cline
laying down any thing concerning the true
Pa&s;toral Language is, becau&s;e we &s;hall &s;ee, I be|lieve,
a Di&s;cour&s;e in a &s;hort time on the Nature
of this kind of Poetry. Where that TENDER in
the Language, which is agreeable to Pa&s;toral, will
be con&s;idered; and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the TENDER
which is &s;uitable to the Epick, and that which the
Tragick Poem requires.</P>
<P>Conclude we then with what the Learned <HI>Ba&s;il
Kennet</HI> &s;ays, in his Life of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> after
&s;peaking of his ru&s;tick Stile. <HI>As for our &s;elves,</HI>

All Young was <HI>PAPLET</HI> and ignorant of

equally tender and innocent. The fir&s;t
eager to be let into the Nature and
Manner of Lovers and the other <HI>SEX</HI>; The other of
a Temper particularly free and inclining. The&s;e, as
<HI>CUBBIN</HI> was inform'd, were at Evening gone out to
a <HI>BUSH</HI> of a &s;weet and plea&s;ant Scituation to tattle
of Love, and of <HI>COLLIKIN SOFLIN'S</HI> Lover. In
pain is <HI>CUBBIN,</HI> lea&s;t the gentle <HI>PAPLET</HI> &s;hould fall
in Love with him too, and goes forth to skulk near
the <HI>BUSH</HI> to hear if it indeed was &s;o. There does the
latter part of their Di&s;cour&s;e, which alone he hears,
confirm the hear-&s;ay. When the gloom of Night
draws on, they go to bath and cool 'em in <HI>EDEN</HI> Brook. There is <HI>PAPLET</HI> &s;olitary and mu&s;ing; and thence, ig|norant
<PB REF="9">
of her Ail, returns alone, by Moon&s;hine to the
<HI>BUSH</HI>: For there <HI>COLLIKIN,</HI> that Morn, had loll'd
with his <HI>LOVE. CUBBIN</HI> &s;oon di&s;covers her unea&s;i|ne&s;s;
for&s;akes hit Covert to attempt her relief; But
endeavouring to divert her thoughts from <HI>COLLIKIN,</HI>
is chid from her &s;ight. So being aver&s;e to her Cure,
&s;he falls intirely in Love.</P>
<P>The time, in this PIECE, is from <HI>Noon</HI> to <HI>Night</HI>;
The Sea&s;on <HI>Summer</HI>; and the Scene on the

beauteous and particularly tender-hearted.
The&s;e walk together to a <HI>GROVE</HI> at

harmle&s;s Swain and gentle Shepherde&s;s. <HI>Lallet,</HI> at
length, leaps up to gather <HI>STRAWBERRYS</HI> for her Lo|ver;
while he, for her, &s;ate plaiting Flowery Gyr|londs,
and wi&s;hing her return. Long he &s;ate, and
long he wi&s;h'd. But &s;he, to rai&s;e his Love, de|lay'd
her return. <HI>Fauney,</HI> as &s;he was about to &s;ur|prize
and joy him with her &s;ight, ri&s;es and runs to
<HI>Paplet</HI> to enquire for her. Then 'tis that <HI>Lallet</HI>'s
&s;oftne&s;s of heart appears. With watry Eyes &s;he ram|bles
thro' the <HI>GROVE</HI>; and accu&s;es her &s;elf of Cruelty.
There find her another Lad and La&s;s, endeavour to
allay her Grief, and &s;ing a chearful <HI>SONG</HI> for her Di|ver&s;ion.
At length, <HI>Cubbin</HI> begs her to go home
with him. She declines it, le&s;t it might occa&s;ion a &s;e|cond
Unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Fauney</HI>; and re&s;olve's to puni&s;h
her &s;elf by &s;taying where &s;he was. She does &s;o. Till
<HI>Fauney,</HI> at length doth come. He skulks behind the
<HI>CAVE</HI> &s;he &s;at in, and hears how unea&s;y &s;he was for
making him &s;o. Anon he &s;urprizes her with his &s;ight,
drys up her Tears and conducts home in the height of
<HI>GOOD-HUMOUR.</HI></P>
