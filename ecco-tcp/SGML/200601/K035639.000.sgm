<HEAD>TO
WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is, I hope, &s;ome propriety in my addre&s;&s;ing a Com|po&s;ition
to you, which would never perhaps have exi&s;ted, had
I not, amid the heavy pre&s;&s;ure of many &s;orrows, derived
infinite con&s;olation from your Poetry, and &s;ome degree of
animation and of confidence from your e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The following performance is far from a&s;piring to be con|&s;idered
as an imitation of your inimitable Poem, "<HI>THE
TASK</HI>;" I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that it belongs not to a
feeble and feminine hand to draw the Bow of Uly&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The force, clearne&s;s, and &s;ublimity of your admirable Poem;
the felicity, almo&s;t peculiar to your genius, of giving to the
mo&s;t familiar objects dignity and effect, I could never hope to
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
reach; yet, having read "The Ta&s;k" almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly from
its fir&s;t publication to the pre&s;ent time, I felt that kind of
enchantment de&s;cribed by Milton, when he &s;ays,
<Q><L>The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear</L>
<L>So charming left his voice, that he awhile</L>
<L>Thought him &s;till &s;peaking.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>And from the force of this impre&s;&s;ion, I was gradually led to
attempt, in Blank Ver&s;e, a delineation of tho&s;e intere&s;ting ob|jects
which happened to excite my attention, and which even
pre&s;&s;ed upon an heart, that has learned, perhaps from its own
&s;ufferings, to feel with acute, though unavailing compa&s;&s;ion,
the calamity of others.</P>
<P>A Dedication u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ts of prai&s;es and of apologies;
<HI>my</HI> prai&s;e can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applau&s;e
of your country. She regards you with pride, as one of the
few, who, at the pre&s;ent period, re&s;cue her from the imputa|tion
of having degenerated in Poetical talents; but in the
form of Apology, I &s;hould have much to &s;ay, if I again dared
to plead the pre&s;&s;ure of evils, aggravated by their long conti|nuance,
as an excu&s;e for the defects of this attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5">
Whatever may be the faults of its execution, let me vindi|cate
my&s;elf from tho&s;e, that may be imputed to the de&s;ign.&mdash;
In &s;peaking of the Emigrant Clergy, I beg to be under&s;tood as
feeling the utmo&s;t re&s;pect for the integrity of their principles;
and it is with plea&s;ure I add my &s;uffrage to that of tho&s;e,
who have had a &s;imilar opportunity of witne&s;&s;ing the conduct
of the Emigrants of all de&s;criptions during their exile in Eng|land;
which has been &s;uch as does honour to <HI>their</HI> nation,
and ought to &s;ecure to them in ours the e&s;teem of every liberal
mind.</P>
<P>Your philanthropy, dear Sir, will induce you, I am per|&s;uaded,
to join with me in hoping, that this painful exile may
finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred &s;o
unworthy of great and enlightened nations; that it may tend
to humanize both countries, by convincing each, that good
qualities exi&s;t in the other; and at length annihilate the pre|judices
that have &s;o long exi&s;ted to the injury of both.</P>
<P>Yet it is unfortunately but too true, that with the body of
the Engli&s;h, this national aver&s;ion has acquired new force by
the dreadful &s;cenes which have been acted in France during
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
the la&s;t &s;ummer&mdash;even tho&s;e who are the victims of the
Revolution, have not e&s;caped the odium, which the undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing
multitude annex to all the natives of a country where
&s;uch horrors have been acted: nor is this the wor&s;t effect tho&s;e
events have had on the minds of the Engli&s;h; by confounding
the original cau&s;e with the wretched cata&s;trophes that have
followed its ill management; the attempts of public virtue,
with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its
di&s;gui&s;e, the very name of Liberty has not only lo&s;t the charm
it u&s;ed to have in Briti&s;h ears, but many, who have written,
or &s;poken, in its defence, have been &s;tigmatized as promoters
of Anarchy, and enemies to the pro&s;perity of their country.
Perhaps even the Author of "The Ta&s;k," with all his good|ne&s;s
and tenderne&s;s of heart, is in the catalogue of tho&s;e,
who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cau&s;e, which
it was once the glory of Engli&s;hmen to avow and defend&mdash;
The exqui&s;ite Poem, indeed, in which you have honoured
Liberty, by a tribute highly gratifying to her &s;incere&s;t
friends, was publi&s;hed &s;ome years before the demolition of
regal de&s;poti&s;in in France, which, in the fifth book, it &s;eems
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
to foretell&mdash;All the truth and energy of the pa&s;&s;age to which
I allude, mu&s;t have been &s;trongly felt, when, in the Parlia|ment
of England, the greate&s;t Orator of our time quoted the
&s;ublime&s;t of our Poets&mdash;when the eloquence of Fox did ju&s;tice
to the genius of Cowper.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, dear SIR,
With the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem,
Your obliged and obedient &s;ervant,
CHARLOTTE SMITH.</SIGNED>

Bernois."]&mdash;Henry the Fourth of France. 

It may be &s;aid of this monarch, that had all the 

French &s;overeigns re&s;embled him, de&s;poti&s;m 

would have lo&s;t its horrors; yet he had 

con&s;iderable failings, and his greate&s;t virtues 

may be chiefly imputed to his education in the 

School of Adver&s;ity.</P>

<P>"Delug'd, as 

with an inland &s;ea, the vales."]&mdash;From 

the heavy and ince&s;&s;ant rains during the la&s;t 

campaign, the armies were often compelled to march 

for many miles through mar&s;hes overflowed; 

&s;uffering the extre|mities of cold and fatigue. 

The pea&s;ants frequently mi&s;led them; and, after 

having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e inundations at the hazard 

of their lives, they were &s;ometimes under the 

nece&s;&s;ity of cro&s;&s;ing them a &s;econd and a 

third time; their evening quarters after &s;uch a 

day of exertion were often in a wood without 

&s;helter; and their repa&s;t, in&s;tead of bread, 

unripe corn, without any other preparation than 

being ma&s;hed into a &s;ort of pa&s;te.</P>

remarkable, that notwith&s;tanding the 

exce&s;&s;ive hard&s;hips to which the army of the 

Emi|grants was expo&s;ed, very few in it &s;uffered 

from di&s;ea&s;e till they began to retreat; then 

it was that de&s;pondence con&s;igned to the mo&s;t 

mi&s;erable death many brave men who de&s;erved a 

better fate; and then de&s;pair im|pelled &s;ome to 

&s;uicide, while others fell by mutual wounds, 

unable to &s;urvive di&s;appointment and 

humiliation.</P>
