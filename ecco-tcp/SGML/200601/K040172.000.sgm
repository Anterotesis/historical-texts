<Q>Rara temporum felicitas, ubi &s;entire quae velis, &amp; quae &s;entias dicere licet. </Q>

<P>_THE Arguments of an Author lo&s;e a great deal of their Weight, when we are per&s;uaded that he only writes for Argument's &s;ake, and has no real Concern in the Cau&s;e which he e&s;pou|&s;es. This is the Ca&s;e of one, who draws his Pen in the Defence of Property, without having any; except, perhaps, in the Copy of a Libel, or a Ballad. One is apt to &s;u&s;pect, that the Pa&s;&s;ion for Liberty, which appears in a Grub|&s;treet Patriot, ari&s;es only from his Apprehen&s;ions of a Gaol; and that, whatever he may pretend, he does not write to &s;ecure, but to get &s;ome|thing of his Own. Should the Government be
<PB N="2" REF="11">
overturn'd, he has nothing to lo&s;e but an old Standi&s;h.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but the Reader will conceive a Re&s;pect for the Author of this Paper, from the Title of it; &s;ince, he may be &s;ure, I am &s;o con|&s;iderable a Man, that I cannot have le&s;s than forty Shillings a Year.</P>
<P>I have rather cho&s;en this Title than any other, becau&s;e it is what I mo&s;t glory in, and what mo&s;t effectually calls to my Mind the Happine&s;s of that Government under which I live. As a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Free-Holder, I &s;hould not &s;cruple taking place of a <HI>French</HI> Marquis; and when I &s;ee one of my Countreymen amu&s;ing him&s;elf in his little Cabbage-Garden, I naturally look upon him as a greater Per&s;on than the Owner of the riche&s;t Vineyard in <HI>Champagne.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons is the Repre&s;enta|tive of Men in my Condition. I con&s;ider my &s;elf as one who give my Con&s;ent to every Law which pa&s;&s;es: A Free-Holder in our Govern|ment being of the Nature of a Citizen of <HI>Rome</HI> in that famous Commonwealth; who, by the Election of a Tribune, had a kind of remote Voice in every Law that was enacted. So that a Freeholder is but one Remove from a Legi&s;la|tor, and for that Rea&s;on ought to &s;tand up in the Defence of tho&s;e Laws, which are in &s;ome degree of his own making. For &s;uch is the Na|ture of our happy Con&s;titution, that the Bulk of the People virtually give their Approbation to e|very thing they are bound to obey, and pre&s;cribe to them&s;elves tho&s;e Rules by which they are to walk.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I declare I am a Free-holder, I do not exclude my &s;elf from any other Title. A Free-Holder may be either a
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Voter, or a Knight of the Shire; a Wit, or a Fox-hunter; a Scholar, or a Soldier; an Alder|man, or a Courtier; a Patriot, or a Stock-Job|ber. But I chu&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by this De|nomination, as the Free-Holder is the Ba&s;is of all other Titles. Dignities may be grafted upon it; but this is the &s;ub&s;tantial Stock, that conveys to them their Life, Ta&s;te, and Beauty; and without which they are no more than Blo&s;&s;oms, that would fall away with every Shake of Wind</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take occa&s;ion to con|gratulate my Countrey upon the Increa&s;e of this happy Tribe of Men, &s;ince, by the Wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent Parliament, I find the Race of Free-Holders &s;preading into the remote&s;t Corners of the I&s;land. I mean that Act which pa&s;s'd in the late Se&s;&s;ion for the Encouragement of Loyalty in <HI>Scotland:</HI> By which it is provided, <HI>That all and every Va&s;&s;al and Va&s;&s;als in</HI> Scotland<HI>, who &s;hall continue peaceable, and in dutiful Allegiance to His Maje&s;ty, His Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, holding Lands or Tenements of any Offender</HI> [guilty of High-Trea&s;on] <HI>who holds &s;uch Lands or Tene|ments immediately of the Crown, &s;hall be ve&s;ted and &s;eized, and are hereby enacted and ordained to hold the &s;aid Lands or Tenements of His Maje&s;ty, His Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, in Fee and Heritage for ever, by &s;uch manner of holding, as any &s;uch Of|fender held &s;uch Lands or Tenements of the Crown,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>By this Means it will be in the Power of a Highlander to be at all times a good Tenant, without being a Rebel; and to de&s;erve the Cha|racter of a faithful Servant, without thinking him&s;elf obliged to follow his Ma&s;ter to the Gal|lows.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13">
How can we &s;ufficiently extol the Goodne&s;s of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who is not willing to have a &s;ingle Slave in his Dominions! Or enough rejoice in the Exerci&s;e of that Loyalty, which, in&s;tead of betraying a Man into the mo&s;t igno|minious Servitude, (as it does in &s;ome of our neighbouring Kingdoms) entitles him to the highe&s;t Privileges of Freedom and Property! It is now to be hoped, that we &s;hall have few Va&s;|&s;als, but to the Laws of our Countrey.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Men have a Ta&s;te of Property, they will naturally love that Con&s;titution from which they derive &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing. There is an un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure in calling any thing one's Own. A Free-Hold, tho' it be but in Ice and Snow, will make the Owner plea&s;ed in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;tout in the Defence of it; and is a very proper Reward of our Allegiance to our pre&s;ent King, who (by an unparallel'd In|&s;tance of Goodne&s;s in a Sovereign, and Infatu|ation in Subjects) contends for the Freedom of his People again&s;t them&s;elves; and will not &s;uf|fer many of them to fall into a State of Slave|ry, which they are bent upon with &s;o much Ea|gerne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>A Free-Holder of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is bred with an Aver&s;ion to every thing that tends to bring him under a Subjection to the arbitrary Will of another. Of this we find frequent In&s;tances in all our Hi&s;tories; where the Per&s;ons, who&s;e Characters are the mo&s;t amiable, and &s;trike us with the highe&s;t Veneration, are tho&s;e who &s;tood up manfully again&s;t the Inva&s;ions of Civil Li|berty, and the complicated Tyranny which Po|pery impo&s;es upon our Bodies, our Fortunes, and our Minds. What a de&s;picable Figure then mu&s;t the pre&s;ent Mock-Patriots make in the Eyes
<PB N="5" REF="14">
of Po&s;terity, who venture to be hang'd, drawn and quartered, for the Ruin of tho&s;e Civil Rights which their Ance&s;tors rather than part with, cho&s;e to be cut to Pieces in the Field of Battel? And what an Opinion will after Ages enter|tain of Their Religion who bid fair for a Gib|bet, by endeavouring to bring in a Super&s;tition, which their Forefathers peri&s;hed in Flames to keep out?</P>
<P>But how in&s;tructive &s;oever the Folly of the&s;e Men may prove to future Times, it will be my Bu&s;ine&s;s more immediately to con&s;ult the Happine&s;s of the Age in which I live. And &s;ince &s;o many profligate Writers have endeavou|red to varni&s;h over a bad Cau&s;e, I &s;hall do all in my Power to recommend a good One, which indeed requires no more than barely to explain what it is. While many of my gallant Coun|treymen are employed in pur&s;uing Rebels half di&s;comfited through the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their Guilt, I &s;hall labour to improve tho&s;e Victories to the Good of my Fellow-Subjects; by carry|ing on our Succe&s;&s;es over the Minds of Men, and by reconciling them to the Cau&s;e of their King, their Countrey, and their Religion.</P>
<P>To this End, I &s;hall in the Cour&s;e of this Pa|per (to be publi&s;hed every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>) endeavour to open the Eyes of my Countreymen to their own Intere&s;t, to &s;hew them the Privi|leges of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Free-Holder, which they en|joy in common with my &s;elf, and to make them &s;en&s;ible how the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings are &s;ecured to us by his Maje&s;ty's Title, his Admini&s;tration, and his Per&s;onal Character.</P>
<P>I have only one Reque&s;t to make to my Rea|ders, that they will peru&s;e the&s;e Papers with the &s;ame Candour and Impartiality in which they are
<PB N="6" REF="15">
written; and &s;hall hope for no other Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of them, than what one would think &s;hould be natural to every Man, a De&s;ire to be happy, and a good Will towards tho&s;e, who are the In&s;truments of making them &s;o.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAving in my fir&s;t Paper &s;et forth the Happi|ne&s;s of my Station as a Free-Holder of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Nature of that Property which is &s;ecured to me by the Laws of my Countrey; I cannot forbear con&s;idering in the next place, That Per&s;on who is entru&s;ted with the Guardian|&s;hip and Execution of tho&s;e Laws. I have lived in one Reign, when the Prince, in&s;tead of invi|gorating the Laws of our Countrey, or giving them their proper Cour&s;e, a&s;&s;um'd a Power of di&s;pen&s;ing with them: And in another, when the Sovereign was flattered by a Set of Men in|to a Per&s;ua&s;ion, that the Regal Authority was unlimited and uncircum&s;cribed. In either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, good Laws are at be&s;t but a dead Letter; and by &s;hewing the People how happy they ought to be, only &s;erve to aggravate the Sen&s;e of their Oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>We have the Plea&s;ure at this Time to &s;ee a King upon the Throne, who hath too much
<PB N="7" REF="16">
Goodne&s;s to wi&s;h for any Power, that does not enable Him to promote the Welfare of His Sub|jects; and too much Wi&s;dom to look upon tho&s;e as His Friends, who would make their Court to Him by the Profe&s;&s;ion of an Obedience, which they never practi&s;ed, and which has al|ways proved fatal to tho&s;e Princes, who have put it to the Trial. His Maje&s;ty gave a Proof of His Sovereign Virtues before He came to the Exerci&s;e of them in this Kingdom. His In|clination to Ju&s;tice led Him to rule His <HI>Ger|man</HI> Subjects in the &s;ame Manner, that our Con|&s;titution directs Him to govern the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He regarded tho&s;e which are our Civil Liberties, as the natural Rights of Mankind; and therefore indulged them to a People, who pleaded no o|ther Claim to them than from His known Good|ne&s;s and Humanity. This Experience of a good Prince, before we had the Happine&s;s to enjoy Him, mu&s;t give great Satisfaction to every think|ing Man, who con&s;iders how apt Sovereignty is to deprave human Nature; and how many of our own Princes made very ill Figures upon the Throne, who, before they a&s;cended it, were the Favourites of the People.</P>
<P>What gives us the greate&s;t Security in the Conduct of &s;o excellent a Prince is That Con|&s;i&s;tency of Behaviour, whereby He inflexibly pur&s;ues tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which appear the mo&s;t ju&s;t and equitable. As He hath the Character of being the mo&s;t prudent in laying proper Schemes; He is no le&s;s remarkable for being &s;tea|dy in accompli&s;hing what He has once concerted. Indeed, if we look into the Hi&s;tory of His pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and reflect upon that wonderful Series of Succe&s;&s;es which have attended Him, I think they cannot be a&s;cribed to any thing &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="17">
much as to this Uniformity and Firmne&s;s of Mind, which has always di&s;covered it &s;elf in His Proceedings. It was by This that He &s;ur|mounted tho&s;e many Difficulties which lay in the Way to His Succe&s;&s;ion; and by which, we have rea&s;on to hope, He will daily make all Oppo&s;ition fall before Him. The fickle and un&s;teady Politicks of our late <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchs, have been the perpetual Source of tho&s;e Di&s;&s;en|tions and Animo&s;ities which have made the Nation unhappy: Whereas the con&s;tant and un|&s;haken Temper of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, mu&s;t have a natural Tendency to the Peace of His Government, and the Unanimity of His People.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am enumerating the publick Virtues of our Sovereign, which are &s;o conducive to the Advantage of tho&s;e who are to obey Him, I cannot but take Notice, that His Maje&s;ty was bred up from His Infancy with a Love to this our Nation, under a Prince&s;s, who was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Woman of her Age, and particularly famous for her Affection to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Our Countreymen were dear to Him, before there was any Pro&s;pect of their being His Subjects; and every one knows, that nothing recommended a Man &s;o much to the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Civilities of His Court, as the being born in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>To the Fame of His Maje&s;ty's Civil Virtues, we may add the Reputation He has acquired by His Martial Atchievements. It is ob&s;erved by Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are particu|ly fond of a King who is Valiant: Upon which Account His Maje&s;ty has a Title to all the E|&s;teem that can be paid the mo&s;t Warlike Prince; tho' at the &s;ame time, for the Good of His Subjects, He &s;tudies to decline all Occa&s;ions of
<PB N="9" REF="18">
Military Glory; and chu&s;es rather to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as the Father, than as the Captain of His People. I am glad his rebellious Subjects are too incon&s;iderable to put him upon exerting that Courage and Conduct, which rai&s;ed him &s;o great a Reputation in <HI>Hungary</HI> and the <HI>Morea,</HI> when he fought again&s;t the Enemies of Chri&s;tianity; and in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he com|manded again&s;t the great Di&s;turber of the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> One would think there was Rea&s;on for the Opinion of tho&s;e, who make Per&s;onal Courage to be an Hereditary Virtue, when we &s;ee &s;o many In&s;tances of it in the Line of <HI>Brun&s;|wick.</HI> To go no farther back than the Time of our pre&s;ent King, where can we find, a|mong the Soveraign Hou&s;es of <HI>Europe,</HI> any other Family, that has furni&s;hed &s;o many Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed Fortitude? Three of His Maje|&s;ty's Brothers have fallen gloriou&s;ly in the Field, fighting again&s;t the Enemies of their Native Countrey: And the Bravery of his Royal High|ne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> is &s;till fre&s;h in our Memory, who fought, with the Spirit of his Father, at the Battel of <HI>Audenarde,</HI> when the Children of <HI>France,</HI> and the Pretender, fled be|fore him.</P>
<P>I might here take Notice of His Maje&s;ty's more private Virtues, but have rather cho&s;en to remind my Countreymen of the publick Parts of His Character, which are &s;upported by &s;uch inconte&s;table Facts as are univer&s;ally known and acknowledged.</P>
<P>Having thus far con&s;ider'd our Happine&s;s in His Maje&s;ty's Civil and Military Character, I cannot forbear plea&s;ing my &s;elf with regarding him in the View of One, who has been always Fortunate. <HI>Cicero</HI> recommends <HI>Pompey</HI> under
<PB N="10" REF="19">
this particular Head to the <HI>Romans,</HI> with whom the Character of being Fortunate was &s;o popu|lar, that &s;everal of their Emperors gave it a Place among their Titles. Good Fortune is often the Reward of Virtue, and as often the Effect of Prudence. And whether it proceeds from either of the&s;e, or from both together, or whatever may be the Cau&s;e of it, every one is naturally plea&s;ed to &s;ee his Intere&s;ts conducted by a Per&s;on who is U&s;ed to good Succe&s;s. The E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Electoral Dignity in His Maje&s;ty's Family, was a Work re&s;erved for him finally to accompli&s;h. A large Acce&s;&s;ion of Dominion fell to Him, by His &s;ucceeding to the Dukedom of <HI>Zell,</HI> whereby He became one of the Greate&s;t Princes of <HI>Germany</HI>; and one of the mo&s;t powerful Per&s;ons, that ever &s;tood next Heirs to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Dutchy of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>O&s;na|burg,</HI> have con&s;iderably &s;trengthned his Intere&s;ts in the Empire, and given a great additional Weight to the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e. But the mo&s;t re|markable Interpo&s;itions of Providence, in favour of him, have appeared in removing tho&s;e &s;eem|ingly invincible Ob&s;tacles to his Succe&s;&s;ion; in taking away, at &s;o critical a Juncture, the Per&s;on who might have proved a dangerous Enemy; in confounding the &s;ecret and open Attempts of his traiterous Subjects; and in giving him the delightful pro&s;pect of tran&s;mitting his Power through a numerous and &s;till-increa&s;ing Pro|geny.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is not to be doubted but every wi&s;e and hone&s;t Subject will concur with Providence in promoting the Glory and Hap|pine&s;s of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who is endowed with all tho&s;e Royal Virtues, that will natu|rally

&s;ecure to us the national Ble&s;&s;ings, which ought to be dear and valuable to a free Peo|ple.</P>

<P>EVERY one knows, that it is u&s;ual for a <HI>French</HI> Officer, who can Write and Read, to &s;et down all the Occurrences of a Campaign, in which he pretends to have been Per&s;onally concern'd; and to publi&s;h them under the Title of his <HI>Memoirs,</HI> when mo&s;t of his Fellow-Sol|diers are dead that might have contradicted any of his Matters of Fact. Many a gallant young Fellow has been killed in Battel before he came to the third Page of his &s;ecret Hi&s;tory; when &s;everal, who have taken more care of their Per&s;ons, have lived to fill a whole Volume with their military Performances, and to a&s;to|ni&s;h the World with &s;uch In&s;tances of their Bravery, as had e&s;caped the Notice of every Body el&s;e. One of our late <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Heroes had, it &s;eems, re&s;olved upon this Method of do|ing him&s;elf Ju&s;tice: And, had he not been nipp'd in the Bud, might have made a very for|midable Figure in his own Works, among Po|&s;terity. A Friend of mine, who had the Pil|lage of his Pockets, has made me a Pre&s;ent of the following Memoirs, which he de&s;ires me to accept as a Part of the Spoils of the Rebels. I

have omitted the Introduction, as more proper for the In&s;pection of a Secretary of State; and &s;hall only &s;et down &s;o much of the Memoirs as &s;eem to be a faithful Narrative of that won+derful Expedition, which drew upon it the Eyes of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<Q>'HAving thus concerted Mea&s;ures for a Ri|&s;ing, we had a general Meeting over a Bowl of Punch. It was here propo&s;ed by one of the Wi&s;e&s;t among us, to draw up a Mani|fe&s;to, &s;etting forth the Grounds and Motives of our taking Arms: For, as he ob&s;erved, there had never yet been an In&s;urrection in <HI>England,</HI> where the Leaders had not thought them&s;elves obliged to give &s;ome Rea&s;ons for it. To this End we laid our Heads together to con&s;ider what Grievances the Nation had &s;uffered under the Reign of King <HI>George.</HI> Af|ter having &s;pent &s;ome Hours upon this Sub|ject, without being able to di&s;cover any, we unanimou&s;ly agreed to Rebel fir&s;t, and to find out Rea&s;ons for it afterwards. It was indeed ea&s;y to gue&s;s at &s;everal Grievances of a pri|vate Nature, which influenced particular Per|&s;ons. One of us had &s;pent his Fortune: A|nother was a younger Brother: A third had the Incumbrance of a Father upon his E&s;tate. But that which principally di&s;po&s;ed us in fa|vour of the Chevalier was, that mo&s;t of the Company had been obliged to take the Abju|ration Oath again&s;t their Will. Being at length thoroughly enflamed with Zeal and Punch, we re&s;olved to take Hor&s;e the next Morning; which we did accordingly, having been joined by a con&s;iderable Reinforcement of <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> whom we could rely
<PB N="13" REF="22">
upon, as knowing them to be the be&s;t <HI>Tories</HI> in the Nation, and avow'd Enemies to <HI>Pres|byteriani&s;m.</HI> We were likewi&s;e joined by a very u&s;eful A&s;&s;ociate, who was a Fidler by Profe&s;&s;ion, and brought in with him a Body of lu&s;ty young Fellows, whom he had tweed|led into the Service. About the third Day of our March I was made a Colonel; tho', I mu&s;t need &s;ay, I gained my Commi&s;&s;ion by my Hor&s;e's Virtues, not my own; having leapt over a &s;ix-bar Gate at the Head of the Cavalry. My General, who is a di&s;cerning Man, hereupon gave me a Regiment; telling me, <HI>He did not que&s;tion but I would do the like when I came to the Enemies Pali&s;adoes.</HI> We pur&s;ued our March with much Intrepidity thro' two or three open Towns, to the great Terror of the Market People, and the Mi&s;|carriage of half a Dozen big-belly'd Women. Notwith&s;tanding the Magi&s;tracy was general|ly again&s;t us, we could di&s;cover many Friends among our Spectators; particularly in two or three Balconies, which were filled with &s;everal tawdry Females, who are known in that Countrey by the ancient Name of <HI>Har|lots.</HI> This Sort of Ladies received us every where with great Demon&s;trations of Joy, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with their Prayers. Af|ter the&s;e &s;ignal Succe&s;&s;es in the North of <HI>England,</HI> it was thought advi&s;able by our Ge|neral to proceed towards our <HI>Scotch</HI> Confe|derates. During our fir&s;t Day's March I a|mu&s;ed my &s;elf with con&s;idering what Po&s;t I &s;hould accept of under <HI>James</HI> the Third, when we had put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Dominions. Being a great Lover of Countrey Sports, I ab&s;olutely determined not
<PB N="14" REF="23">
to be a Mini&s;ter of State, nor to be fobb'd off with a Garter; till at length pa&s;&s;ing by a no|ble Countrey-Seat which belongs to a <HI>Whig,</HI> I re&s;olved to beg it; and plea&s;ed my&s;elf the Remainder of the Day with &s;everal Alterati|ons I intended to make in it. For though the Situation was very delightful, I neither liked the Front of the Hou&s;e, nor the Avenues that led to it. We were indeed &s;o confident of Succe&s;s, that I found mo&s;t of my Fellow-Sol|diers were taken up with Imaginations of the &s;ame Nature. There had like to have been a Duel between two of our Subalterns, upon a di&s;pute which of them &s;hould be Governour of <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> A <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t about the &s;ame Time gave great Offence to a <HI>Northumberland</HI> Squire, whom he threatned to Excommunicate, if he did not give up to him the Church-Lands, which his Family had u&s;urped ever &s;ince the Reformation. In &s;hort, every Man had cut out a Place for him&s;elf in his own Thoughts; &s;o that I could reckon up in our little Army two or three Lord-Trea&s;urers, half a Dozen Secretaries of State, and at lea&s;t a Score of Lords Ju&s;tices in Eyre for each Side of <HI>Trent.</HI> We pur&s;ued our March thro' &s;everal Villages, which we drank dry, making Proclamation at our Entrance, in the Name of <HI>James</HI> the Third, again&s;t all Concealments of Ale or Brandy. Being very much fatigued with the Action of a whole Week, it was agreed to re&s;t on <HI>Sunday,</HI> when we heard a mo&s;t excel|lent Sermon. Our Chaplain in&s;i&s;ted princi|pally upon Two Heads. Under the Fir&s;t he proved to us, that the Breach of Publick Oaths is no Perjury; And under the Second ex|pounded to us the Nature of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance;
<PB N="15" REF="24">
which might be interpreted from the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> to &s;ignify either Loyalty or Rebellion, accord|ing as the Soveraign be&s;towed his Favours and Preferments. He concluded with ex|horting us, in a mo&s;t pathetick Manner, to Purge the Land by Whole&s;ome Severities, and to Propagate Sound Principles by Fire and Sword. We &s;et forward the next Day to|wards our Friends at <HI>Kel&s;o</HI>; but by the Way had like to have lo&s;t our General, and &s;ome of our mo&s;t active Officers. For a Fox un|luckily cro&s;&s;ing the Road, drew off a con&s;i|derable Detachment, who clapped Spurs to their Hor&s;es, and pur&s;ued him with Whoops and Hollows till we had lo&s;t Sight of them. A Covey of Patridges &s;pringing in our Front, put our Infantry in Di&s;order on the &s;ame Day. It was not long after this that we were joined by our Friends from the other Side of the <HI>Frith.</HI> Upon the Junction of the Two Corps our Spies brought us Word, that they di&s;covered a great Cloud of Du&s;t at &s;ome di|&s;tance; upon which we &s;ent out a Party to Reconnoitre. They returned to us with In|telligence, that the Du&s;t was rai&s;ed by a great Drove of Black Cattel. This News was not a little welcome to us, the Army of both Na|tions being very Hungry. We quickly form|ed our&s;elves, and received Orders for the At|tack, with po&s;itive In&s;tructions to give no Quarter. Every thing was executed with &s;o-much good Order, that we made a very plen|tiful Supper. We had, three Days after, the &s;ame Succe&s;s again&s;t a Flock of Sheep, which we were forced to eat with great Precipitati|on, having received Advice of General <HI>Car|penter</HI>'s March as we were at Dinner. Up|on
<PB N="16" REF="25">
this Alarm we made incredible Stretches towards the South, with a De&s;ign to gain the Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of <HI>Pre&s;ton.</HI> We did little remarka|ble in our Way, except &s;etting Fire to a few Hou&s;es, and frighting an old Woman in|to Fits. We had now got a long Day's March of the Enemy; and meeting with a con&s;iderable Refre&s;hment of <HI>October,</HI> all the Officers a&s;&s;embled over it, among whom were &s;everal <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Lords and Gentlemen, who toa&s;ted many loyal Healths and Confu&s;ions, and wept very plentifully for the Danger of the Church. We &s;at till Midnight, and at our Parting re&s;olved to give the Enemy Bat|tel; but the next Morning changed our Re&s;o|lutions, and pro&s;ecuted our March with in|defatigable Speed. We were no &s;ooner ar|rived upon the Frontiers of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> but we &s;aw a great Body of Militia drawn up in Array again&s;t us. Orders were given to Halt; and a Council of War was immediately cal|led, wherein we agreed, with that great U|nanimity which was &s;o remarkable among us on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, to make a Retreat. But before we could give the Word, the Train|bands, taking Advantage of our Delay, fled fir&s;t. We arrived at <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> without any me|morable Adventure; where, after having form|ed many Barricades, and prepared for a vigo|rous Re&s;i&s;tance, upon the Approach of the King's Troops under General <HI>Wills,</HI> who was u&s;ed to the Outlandi&s;h Way of making War, we thought it high Time to put in Practice that Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience, in which our Party &s;o much glories, and which I wou'd advi&s;e them to &s;tick to for the future.'</Q>

<P>IT is with great Satisfaction I ob&s;erve, that the Women of our I&s;land, who are the mo&s;t eminent for Virtue and good Sen&s;e, are in the Intere&s;t of the pre&s;ent Government. As the fair Sex very much recommend the Cau&s;e they are engaged in, it would be no &s;mall Misfortune to a Soveraign, tho' he had all the Male Part of the Nation on his Side, if he did not find him|&s;elf King of the mo&s;t beautiful Half of his Sub|jects. Ladies are always of great u&s;e to the Party they e&s;pou&s;e, and never fail to win over Numbers to it. Lovers, according to Sir <HI>Wil|liam Petty</HI>'s Computation, make at lea&s;t the Third Part of the fencible Men of the Briti&s;h Nation; and it has been an uncontroverted Maxim in all Ages, that, though a Husband is &s;ometimes a &s;tubborn Sort of a Creature, a Lover is always at the Devotion of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. By this means it lies in the Power of every fine Woman, to &s;ecure at lea&s;t half a Dozen able|bodied Men to His Maje&s;ty's Service. The
<PB N="18" REF="27">
Female World are likewi&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the be&s;t Cau&s;es to manage the Con|trover&s;ial Part of them, in which no Man of tolerable Breeding is ever able to refute them. Arguments out of a pretty Mouth are unan|&s;werable.</P>
<P>It is indeed remarkable that the Inferiour Tribe of common Women, who are a Di&s;ho|nour to their Sex, have, in mo&s;t Reigns, been the profe&s;s'd Sticklers for &s;uch as have acted in Oppo&s;ition to the true Intere&s;t of the Nation. The mo&s;t numerous Converts in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, were particularly noted to be of this kind. I can give no other Rea&s;on for &s;uch a Behaviour, unle&s;s it be, that it is not for the Advantage of the&s;e Female Adventurers the Laws of the Land &s;hould take Place, and that they know <HI>Bridewell</HI> is a Part of our Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>There are many Rea&s;ons why the Women of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hou'd be on the Side of the Free-holder, and Enemies to the Per&s;on who would bring in Arbitrary Government and Po|pery. As there are &s;everal of our Ladies who amu&s;e them&s;elves in the reading of Travels, they cannot but take Notice what uncomfor|table Lives tho&s;e of their own Sex lead, where Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience is profe&s;&s;ed and practis'd in its utmo&s;t Perfection. In tho&s;e Countries the Men have no Property but in their Wives, who are the Slaves to Slaves: every married Woman being &s;ubject to a dome&s;tick Tyrant, that requires from her the &s;ame Va&s;&s;alage which he pays to his Sultan. If the Ladies would &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;ider the evil Con&s;equences of ar|bitrary lower, they would find, that it &s;poils the Shape of the Foot in <HI>China,</HI> where the bar|barous
<PB N="19" REF="28">
Politicks of the Men &s;o dimini&s;h the Ba|&s;is of the Female Figure, as to unqualify a Wo|man for an Evening Walk or Countrey Dance. In the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> a Widow, who has any Re|gard to her Character, throws her &s;elf into the Flames of her Husband's Funeral Pile, to &s;hew, for&s;ooth, that &s;he is faithful and loyal to the Memory of her decea&s;ed Lord. In <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> the Daughters of <HI>Eve,</HI> as they call them, are reckon|ed in the Inventory of their Goods and Chat|tels: and it is a u&s;ual Thing when a Man &s;ells a Bale of Silk, or a Drove of Camels, to to&s;s half a dozen Women into the Bargain. Thro' all the Dominions of the Great <HI>Turk,</HI> a Wo|man thinks her &s;elf happy if &s;he can get but the twelfth Share of a Husband, and is thought of no manner of u&s;e in the Creation, but to keep up a proper Number of Slaves for the Com|mander of the Faithful. I need not &s;et forth the ill U&s;age, which the fair Ones meet with in tho&s;e de&s;potick Governments that lie nearer us. Every one hath heard of the &s;everal Ways of locking up Women in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; where, if there is any Power lodged in any of the Sex, it is not among the young and the beautiful, whom Nature &s;eems to have formed for it, but among the old and wither'd Matrons, known by the frightful Name of <HI>Gouvernantes</HI> and <HI>Duegna</HI>'s. If any &s;hould alledge the Freedoms indulged to the French Ladies, he mu&s;t own that the&s;e are owing to the natural Gallantry of the People, not to their Form of Government, which excludes by its very Con&s;titution every Female from Power, as naturally unfit to hold the Sceptre of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Women ought in rea&s;on to be no le&s;s aver&s;e to Popery than to arbitrary Power. Some
<PB N="20" REF="29">
merry Authors have pretended to demon&s;trate, that the <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Religion could never &s;pread in a Nation, where Women would have more Mode&s;ty than to expo&s;e their innocent Liberties to a Confe&s;&s;or. Others of the &s;ame Turn, have a&s;&s;ured us, that the fine <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Complection, which is &s;o peculiar to our La|dies, would &s;uffer very much from a Fi&s;h-Diet: And that a whole <HI>Lent</HI> would give &s;uch a Sallowne&s;s to the celebrated Beauties of this I&s;land, as would &s;carce make them di&s;tingui&s;h|able from tho&s;e of <HI>France.</HI> I &s;hall only leave to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of my Countrey-Women the Danger any of them might have been in, (had Popery been our National Reli|gion) of being forced by their Relations to a State of perpetual Virginity. The mo&s;t bloom|ing Toa&s;t in the I&s;land might have been a Nun; and many a Lady, who is now a Mother of fine Children, condemned to a Condition of Life, di&s;agreeable to her&s;elf, and unprofitable to the World.

The Freedom and Happine&s;s of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies is &s;o &s;ingular, that it is a common Say|ing in foreign Countries, <HI>If a Bridge were built cro&s;s the Seas, all the Women in</HI> Europe <HI>would flock into</HI> England. It has been ob&s;erved, that the Laws relating to them are &s;o favourable, that one would think they them&s;elves had gi|ven Votes in enacting them. All the Honours and Indulgences of Society are due to them by our Cu&s;toms; and, by our Con&s;titution, they have all the Privileges of <HI>Engli&s;h-</HI>born Subjects, without the Burdens. I need not acquaint my fair Fellow-Freeholders, that every Man, who is anxious for our &s;acred and civil Rights, is a Champion in their Cau&s;e; &s;ince we enjoy in common a Religion agreeable to that rea&s;onable Nature, of which we equally partake; and &s;ince, in Point of Property, our Law makes no Di|&s;tinction of Sexes.</P>
<P>We may therefore ju&s;tly expect from them, that they will act in concert with us for the Pre&s;ervation of our Laws and Religion, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but under the Government of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; and would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ubverted, under that of a Per&s;on bred up in the mo&s;t violent Principles of Popery and arbi|trary Power.

<P>THere is no greater Sign of a general Decay of Virtue in a Nation, than a Want of Zeal in its Inhabitants for the Good of their Coun|trey. This generous and publick-&s;pirited Pa&s;&s;ior has been ob&s;erved of late Years to langui&s;h and grow cold in this our I&s;land; where a Party of Men have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to repre&s;ent it as chimerical and romantick, to de&s;troy in the Minds of the People the Sen&s;e of national Glo|ry, and to turn into Ridicule our natural and ancient Allies, who are united to us by the com|mon intere&s;ts both of Religion and Policy. It may not therefore be un&s;ea&s;onable to recom|mend to this pre&s;ent Generation the Practice of that Virtue, for which their Ance&s;tors were par|ticularly famous, and which is call'd <HI>The Love of one's Countrey.</HI> This Love to our Countrey, as a moral Virtue, is a fix'd Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind to promote the Safety; Welrare, and Reputa|tion of the Community in which we are born, and of the Con&s;titution under which we are protected. Our Obligation to this great Duty, may appear to us from &s;everal Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32">
In the fir&s;t Place we may ob&s;erve, that we are directed to it by one of tho&s;e &s;ecret Sugge&s;tions of Nature, which go under the Name of <HI>In|&s;tinct,</HI> and which are never given in vain. As Self-love is an In&s;tinct planted in us for the Good and Safety of each particular Per&s;on, the Love of our Countrey is impre&s;s'd on our Minds for the Happine&s;s and Pre&s;ervation of the Com|munity. This In&s;tinct is &s;o remarkable, that we find Examples of it in tho&s;e who are born in the mo&s;t uncomfortable Climates, or the wor&s;t of Governments. We read of an Inha|bitant of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> who, after having liv'd &s;ome Time in <HI>Denmark,</HI> where he was cloath'd and treated with the utmo&s;t Indulgence, took the fir&s;t Opportunity of making his E&s;cape, tho' with the Hazard of his Life, into his native Regions of Cold, Poverty and Nakedne&s;s. We have an In&s;tance of the &s;ame Nature among the very <HI>Hottentots.</HI> One of the&s;e Savages was brought into <HI>England,</HI> taught our Language, and in a great Mea&s;ure poli&s;h'd out of his natural Bar|barity: But upon being carry'd back to the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> (where it was thought he might have been of Advantage to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traders) he mix'd in a kind of Tran&s;port with his Coun|treymen, brutaliz'd with 'em in their Habit and Manners, and wou'd never again return to his foreign Acquaintance. I need not mention the common Opinion of the <HI>Negroes</HI> in our Planta|tions, who have no other Notion of a future State of Happine&s;s, than that, after Death, they &s;hall be convey'd back to their native Countrey.

<P>Farther, tho' there is a Benevolence due to all Mankind, none can que&s;tion but a &s;uperior De|gree of it is to be paid to a Father, a Wife, or a Child. In the &s;ame Manner, tho' our Love &s;hould reach to the whole Species, a greater Proportion of it &s;hould exert it &s;elf towards
<PB N="25" REF="34">
that Community in which Providence has pla|ced us. This is our proper Sphere of Action, the Province allotted to us for the Exerci&s;e of all our Civil Virtues, and in which alone we have Opportunities of expre&s;&s;ing our Good Will to Mankind. I cou'd not but be pleas'd in the Accounts of the late <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Emba&s;&s;y into <HI>France,</HI> with a particular Ceremony of the Emba&s;&s;ador; who, every Morning, before he went abroad, religiou&s;ly &s;aluted a Turf of Earth dug out of his own native Soil, to remind him, that in all the Tran&s;actions of the Day he was to think of his Countrey, and pur&s;ue its Advantages. If, in the &s;everal Di&s;tricts and Divi&s;ions of the World, Men would thus &s;tudy the Welfare of tho&s;e re|&s;pective Communities, to which their Power of doing Good is limited, the whole Race of rea|&s;onable Creatures would be happy, as far as the Benefits of Society can make them &s;o. At lea&s;t, we find &s;o many Ble&s;&s;ings naturally flow|ing from this noble Principle, that, in Propor|tion, as it prevails, every Nation becomes a pro&s;perous and flouri&s;hing People.</P>
<P>It may be yet a farther Recommendation of this particular Virtue, if we con&s;ider, that no Nation was ever famous for its Morals, which was not at the &s;ame Time remarkable for its publick Spirit: Patriots naturally ri&s;e out of a <HI>Spartan</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue: And there is no Re|mark more common among the Antient Hi&s;to|rians, than that when the State was corrupted with Avarice and Luxury, it was in Danger of being Betray'd, or Sold.</P>
<P>To the foregoing Rea&s;ons for the Love which every good Man owes to his Countrey, we may add, that the Actions, which are mo&s;t celebrated in Hi&s;tory, and which are read with the greate&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="35">
Admiration, are &s;uch as proceed from this Prin|ciple. The e&s;tabli&s;hing of good Laws, the de|tecting of Con&s;piracies, the cru&s;hing of Sediti|ons and Rebellions, the falling in Battel, or the devoting of a Man's &s;elf to certain Death for the Safety of Fellow-Citizens, are Actions that al|ways warm the Reader, and endear to him Per|&s;ons of the remote&s;t Ages, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant Countries.</P>
<P>And as Actions, that proceed from the Love of one's Countrey, are more Illu&s;trious than any other in the Records of Time; &s;o we find that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who have been eminent in other Virtues, have been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by This.

But, to look out for no o|ther In&s;tance, what was ever more moving, than his Lamentation over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> at his fir&s;t Ap|proach to it, notwith&s;tanding he had foretold the cruel and unju&s;t Treatment he was to meet with in that City! For he fore&s;aw the De&s;truction which in a few Years was to fall upon that Peo|ple; a De&s;truction not to be parallell'd in any Nation from the Beginning of the World to this Day; and in the View of it melted into Tears. His Followers have in many Places expre&s;&s;ed the like Sentiments of Affection for their Countrey|men, among which none is more extraordinary than that of the great Convert, who wi&s;h'd he him&s;elf might be made a Cur&s;e, provided it might turn to the Happine&s;s of his Nation; or as he words it, <HI>Of his Brethren and Kin&s;men, who are</HI> I&s;raelites. This In&s;tance naturally brings to Mind the &s;ame Heroick Temper of Soul in the great <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law-Giver, who would have devoted him&s;elf in the &s;ame Manner, rather than &s;ee his People peri&s;h. It would indeed be difficult to find out any Man of extraordinary Piety in the Sacred Writings, in whom this Virtue is not highly con&s;picuous. The Reader however will excu&s;e me, if I take Notice of one Pa&s;&s;age, be|cau&s;e it is a very fine One, and wants only a Place in &s;ome Polite Author of <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> to have been admired and celebrated.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT a Time when &s;o many of the King's Subjects pre&s;ent them&s;elves before their re&s;pective Magi&s;trates to take the Oaths required by Law, it may not be improper to awaken in the Minds of my Readers a due Sen&s;e of the En|gagement under which they lay them&s;elves. It is a melancholy Con&s;ideration, that there &s;hould be &s;everal among us &s;o hardened and delu|ded, as to think an Oath a proper Subject for a Je&s;t; and to make this, which is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn Acts of Religion, an Occa&s;ion of Mirth. Yet &s;uch is the Depravation of our Manners at pre&s;ent, that nothing is more frequent than to near profligate Men ridiculing, to the be&s;t of their Abilities, the&s;e Sacred Pledges of their Du|ty and Allegiance; and endeavouring to be witty upon them&s;elves, for daring to prevaricate with God and Man. A poor Conceit of their own, or a Quotation out of <HI>Hudibras,</HI> &s;hall make 'em treat with Levity an Obligation wherein their Safety and Welfare are concern'd both as to this World and the next. Raillery of this Nature, is enough to make the Hearer tremble. As the&s;e Mi&s;creants &s;eem to glory in the Profe&s;&s;ion of their Impiety, there is no Man, who has any Regard to his Duty, or even to his Reputation, that can appear in their Defence. But if there are Others of a more &s;erious Turn, who join with us deli|berately in the&s;e Religious Profe&s;&s;ions of Loyalty to our Sovereign, with any private Salvo's or Eva|&s;ions,
<PB N="31" REF="40">
they would do well to con&s;ider tho&s;e Max|ims, in which all Ca&s;ui&s;ts are agreed, who have gained any E&s;teem for their Learning, Judgment, or Morality. The&s;e have unanimou&s;ly determined that an Oath is always to be taken in the Sen&s;e of that Authority which impo&s;es it: And that tho&s;e, who&s;e Hearts do not concur with their Lips in the Form of the&s;e publick Prote&s;tations; or who have any mental Re&s;erves, or who take an Oath again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, upon any Motive what|&s;oever; or with a De&s;ign to break it, or repent of it, are guilty of Perjury. Any of the&s;e, or the the like Circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of alleviating the Crime, make it more hainous, as they are pre|mediated Frauds (which it is the chief De&s;ign of an Oath to prevent) and the mo&s;t flagrant in&s;tances of In&s;incerity to Men, and Irreverence to their Maker. For this Rea&s;on, the Perjury of a Man, who takes an Oath, with an Intention to keep it, and is afterwards &s;educed to the Vio|lation of it, (tho' a Crime not to be thought of, without the greate&s;t Horror) is yet, in &s;ome Re|&s;pects, not quite &s;o black as the Perjury above|mentioned. It is indeed a very unhappy Token of the great Corruption of our Manners, that there &s;hould be any &s;o incon&s;iderate among us, as to &s;acrifice the &s;tanding and e&s;&s;ential Duties of Morality, to the Views of Politicks; and that, as in my la&s;t Paper, it was no un&s;ea&s;onable to prove the Love of our Countrey to be a Virtue, &s;o in this there &s;hould be any Occa&s;ion to &s;hew that Perjury is a Sin. But it is our Misfortune to live in an Age when &s;uch wild and unnatural Doctrines have prevailed among &s;ome of our Fellow-Subjects, that if One looks into their Schemes of Government, they &s;eem according as they are in the Humour, to believe that a
<PB N="32" REF="41">
Soveraign is not to be re&s;trained by his Corona|tion Oath, or his People by their Oaths of Alle|giance: Or to repre&s;ent them in a plainer Light in &s;ome Reigns they are both for a Power and an Obedience that is unlimited, and in others are for retrenching within the narrowe&s;t Bounds, both the Authority of the Prince, and the Alle|giance of the Subject.</P>
<P>Now the Guilt of Perjury is &s;o &s;elf-evident, that it was always reckoned among the greate&s;t Crimes, by tho&s;e who were only govern'd by the Light of Rea&s;on: The inviolable ob&s;erving of an Oath, like the other practical Duties of Chri&s;tianity, is a Part of Natural Religion. As Rea&s;on is common to all Mankind, the Dictates of it are the &s;ame through the whole Species: And &s;ince every Man's own Heart will tell him, that there can be no greater Affront to the Deity, whom he wor&s;hips, than to appeal to him with an Intention to deceive; nor a greater Inju&s;tice to Men, than to betray them by fal&s;e A&s;&s;urances; it is no Wonder that Pagans and Chri&s;tians, In|fidels and Believers, &s;hould concur in a Point wherein the Honour of the Supream Being, and the Welfare of Society are &s;o highly concerned. For this Rea&s;on, <HI>Pythagoras</HI> to his fir&s;t Precept of honouring the Immortal Gods, immediately &s;ub|joyns that of paying Veneration to an Oath. We may &s;ee the Reverence which the Heathens &s;hew'd to the&s;e Sacred and Solemn Engagements, from the Inconveniences which they often &s;uffered, ra|ther than break through them. We have frequent In&s;tances of this Kind in the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth; which, as it has been ob&s;erved by &s;e|veral Eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers, very much excell'd all other <HI>Pagan</HI> Governments in the Practice of Virtue. How far they exceeded in this Particu|lar,
<PB N="33" REF="42">
tho&s;e great Corrupters of Chri&s;tianity, and indeed of Natural Religion, the Je&s;ui&s;ts, may appear from their Abhorrence of every Thing that looked like a fraudulent or mental Eva&s;ion. Of this I &s;hall only produce the following In&s;tance. Several <HI>Romans,</HI> who had been taken Pri&s;oners by <HI>Hannibal,</HI> were relea&s;ed, upon obliging them|&s;elves by an Oath to return again to his Camp. Among the&s;e there was One, who thinking to elude the Oath, went the &s;ame Day back to the Camp, on Pretence of having forgot &s;omething. But this Prevarication was &s;o &s;hocking to the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, that they order'd him to be appre|hended, and deliver'd up to <HI>Hannibal.</HI></P>
<P>We may farther &s;ee the ju&s;t Sen&s;e the Heathens had of the Crime of Perjury, from the Penalties which they inflicted on the Per&s;ons guilty of it. Perjury among the <HI>Scythians</HI> was a Capital Crime; and among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> al&s;o was puni&s;hed with Death, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> relates, who ob&s;erves that an Offender of this Kind, is guilty of tho&s;e two Crimes (wherein the Malignity of Perjury truly con&s;i&s;ts) a failing in his Re&s;pect to the Di|vinity, and in his Faith towards Men. 'Tis unnece&s;&s;ary to multiply In&s;tances of this Nature, which may be found in almo&s;t every Author who has written on this Subject.</P>
<P>If Men, who had no other Guide but their Rea&s;on, con&s;ider'd an Oath to be of &s;uch a tre|mendous Nature, and the Violation of it to be &s;o great a Crime; it ought to make a much deep|er Impre&s;&s;ion upon Minds enlighten'd by Revea|led Religion, as they have more exalted Notions of the Divinity. A &s;uppo&s;ed Heathen Deity might be &s;o poor in his Attributes, &s;o &s;tinted in his Knowledge, Goodne&s;s, or Power, that a Pa|gan might hope to conceal his Perjury from his
<PB N="34" REF="43">
Notice, or not to provoke him, &s;hou'd he be di|&s;cover'd, or &s;hou'd he provoke him, not to be puni&s;h'd by him. Nay, he might have produced Examples of Fal&s;hood and Perjury in the Gods them&s;elves, to whom he appeal'd. But as Re|vealed Religion has given us a more ju&s;t and clear Idea of the Divine Nature, He, whom we appeal to, is Truth it &s;elf, the Great Searcher of Hearts, who will not let Fraud and Fal&s;hood go unpuni&s;hed, or <HI>hold him guiltle&s;s, that taketh His Name in vain.</HI> And as with Regard to the Deity, &s;o likewi&s;e with Regard to Man, the O|bligation of an Oath is &s;tronger upon Chri&s;tians than upon any other Part of Mankind; and that becau&s;e Charity, Truth, mutual Confidence, and all other Social Duties are carry'd to greater Heights, and enforc'd with &s;tronger Motives by the Principles of our Religion.</P>
<P>Perjury, with Relation to the Oaths which are at pre&s;ent requir'd of us, has in it all the ag|gravating Circum&s;tances, which can attend that Crime. We take them before the Magi&s;trates of Publick Ju&s;tice; are reminded by the Ceremony, that it is a Part of that Obedience which we learn from the Go&s;pel; expre&s;&s;ly di&s;avow all E|va&s;ions and mental Re&s;ervations what&s;oever; appeal to Almighty God for the Integrity of our Hearts, and only de&s;ire Him to be our Helper, as we fulfil the Oath we there take in His Pre&s;ence. I mention the&s;e Circum&s;tances, to which &s;everal other might be added, becau&s;e it is a received Doctrine among tho&s;e, who have treated of the Nature of an Oath, that the greater the Solem|nities are which attend it, the more they aggra|vate the Violation of it. And here what mu&s;t be the Succe&s;s that a Man can hope for who turns a Rebel, after having di&s;claimed the Divine A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="35" REF="44">
but upon Condition of being a Faithful and Loyal Subject? He fir&s;t of all de&s;ires that God may help him, as he &s;hall keep his Oaths, and afterwards hope to pro&s;per in an Enterprize, which is the direct Breach of it.</P>
<P>Since therefore Perjury, by the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, the Rea&s;on of the Thing, and from the whole Tenor of Chri&s;tianity, is a Crime of &s;o flagitious a Nature, we cannot be too careful in avoiding every Approach towards it.</P>
<P>The Virtue of the Ancient <HI>Athenians</HI> is very remarkable in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Euripides.</HI> This great Tragick Poet, tho' famous for the Morality of his Plays, had introduced a Per&s;on, who, being reminded of an Oath he had taken, reply'd, <HI>I &s;wore with my Mouth, but not with my Heart.</HI> The Impiety of this Sentiment &s;et the Audience in an Uproar; made <HI>Socrates</HI> (tho' an intimate Friend of the Poet) go out of the Theatre with Indig|nation; and gave &s;o great Offence, that he was publickly accu&s;ed, and brought upon his Tryal, as One who had &s;ugge&s;ted an Eva&s;ion of what they thought the mo&s;t Holy and Indi&s;&s;oluble Bond of human Society. So jealous were the&s;e Vir|tuous Heathens of any the &s;malle&s;t. Hint, that might open a Way to Perjury.</P>
<P>And here it highly imports us to con&s;ider, that we do not only break our Oath of Allegiance by Actual Rebellion, but by all tho&s;e other Methods which have a natural and manife&s;t Tendency to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; The Guilt may lye upon a Man, where the Penalty cannot take Hold of him. Tho&s;e who &s;peak irreverently of the Per&s;on to whom they have &s;worn Allegiance; who endeavour to alie|nate from Him the Hearts of His Subjects; or to in&s;pire the People with Di&s;affection to His Go|vernment, cannot be thought to be true to the
<PB N="36" REF="45">
Oath they have taken. And as for tho&s;e, who by concerted Fal&s;hoods and Defamations endea|vour to blemi&s;h His Character, or weaken His Authority; they incur the complicated Guilt both of Slander and Perjury. The moral Crime is compleated in &s;uch Offenders, and there are only accidental Circum&s;tances wanting, to work it up for the Cognizance of the Law.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;ufficient for a Man, who has given the&s;e Solemn A&s;&s;urances to his Prince, to for|bear the doing Him any Evil, unle&s;s at the &s;ame Time he do Him all the Good he can in his pro|per Station of Life.</P>
<P>Loyalty is of an Active Nature, and ought to di&s;cover it &s;elf in all the In&s;tances of Zeal and Affection to our Sovereign: And if we carefully examine the Duty of that Allegiance which we pledge to His Maje&s;ty, by the Oaths that are ten|dred to us, we &s;hall find that <HI>We do</HI> not only <HI>re|nounce, refu&s;e, and abjure any Allegiance or Obedi|ence to the Pretender,</HI> but <HI>Swear to defend King</HI> George <HI>to the utmo&s;t of our Power, again&s;t all Trai|terous Con&s;piracies and Attempts what&s;oever, and to di&s;clo&s;e and make known to His Maje&s;ty, all Trea|&s;ons and Traiterous Con&s;piracies, which we &s;hall know to be again&s;t Him.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, as among tho&s;e who have bound them&s;elves by the&s;e Sacred Obligations, the a|ctual Traytor or Rebel is guilty of Perjury in the Eye of the Law; the &s;ecret Promoter, or Well-Wi&s;her of the Cau&s;e, is &s;o before the Tribunal of Con&s;cience. And tho' I &s;hould be unwilling to pronounce the Man who is indolent, or in|different in the Cau&s;e of his Prince, to be ab&s;o|lutely perjured; I may venture to affirm, that he falls very &s;hort of that Allegiance to which he is obliged by Oath. Upon the whole we may be
<PB N="37" REF="46">
a&s;&s;ured, that in a Nation which is tyed down by &s;uch Religious and Solemn Engagements, the People's Loyalty will keep pace with their Mo|rality; and that in Proportion as they are &s;incere Chri&s;tians, they will be faithful Subjects.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t glorious of His Maje&s;ty's Pre|dece&s;&s;ors was treated after the &s;ame Manner. Upon that Prince's fir&s;t Arrival, the incon&s;ide|rable Party, who then laboured to make him o|dious
<PB N="38" REF="47">
to the People, gave out, That he brought with him twenty thou&s;and <HI>Laplanders,</HI> cloathed in the Skins of Bears, all of their own killing; and that they mutiny'd becau&s;e they had not been regaled with a bloody Battel within two Days after their Landing. He was no &s;ooner on the Throne, than tho&s;e, who had contributed to place him there, finding that he had made &s;ome Changes at Court which were not to their Hu|mour, endeavoured to render him Unpopular by Mi&s;repre&s;entations of his Per&s;on, his Cha|racter, and his Actions. They found that his No&s;e had a Re&s;emblance to that of <HI>Oliver Crom|wel,</HI> and clapt him on a huge Pair of Mu&s;tachoes to frighten his People with: His Mercy was Fear; his Ju&s;tice was Cruelty; his Tempe|rance, Oeconomy, prudent Behaviour, and Ap|plication to Bu&s;ine&s;s, were <HI>Dutch</HI> Virtues; and &s;uch as we had not been u&s;ed to in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings. He did not fight a Battel, in which the <HI>Tories</HI> did not &s;lay double the Number of what he had lo&s;t in the Field; nor ever rai&s;ed a Siege, or gain'd a Victory, which did not co&s;t more than 'twas worth. In &s;hort, he was contriving the Ruin of his Kingdom; and in order to it ad|vanc'd Dr. <HI>Tul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t&s;on</HI> to the highe&s;t Station of the Church, my Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> of the Law, Mr. <HI>Mountague</HI> of the Trea&s;ury, and the Admiral at <HI>la Hegue</HI> of the Fleet. Such were the Calum|nies of the Party in tho&s;e Times, which we &s;ee &s;o faithfully copied out by Men of the &s;ame Principles under the Reign of His pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>As the Schemes of the&s;e Gentlemen are the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and contradictory to common Sen&s;e, the Means by which they are promoted mu&s;t be of the &s;ame Nature. Nothing but Weakne&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="48">
and Folly can di&s;po&s;e <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to the Intere&s;ts of a <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender:</HI> And the &s;ame Abilities of Mind will naturally qualify his Adherents to &s;wallow the mo&s;t palpable and notorious Fal&s;hoods. Their &s;elf-intere&s;ted and de&s;igning Leaders cannot de&s;ire a more ductile and ea&s;y People to work upon. How long was it before many of this &s;imple, deluded Tribe were brought to believe, that the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were a Generation of Men that could be con|quer'd! The Rabble of the Party were in&s;truct|ed to look upon 'em as &s;o many <HI>Giants</HI> and <HI>Sa|racens</HI>; and were very much &s;urprized to find, that every one of 'em had not with his broad Sword mow'd down at lea&s;t a Squadron of the King's Forces. There were not only publick Rejoycings in the Camp at <HI>Perth,</HI> but likewi&s;e many private Congratulations nearer us, among the&s;e Well-wi&s;hers to their Countrey, upon the Victories of their Friends at <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>; which continued till the Rebels made their &s;olemn Ca|valcade from <HI>Highgate.</HI> Nay, there were then &s;ome of the&s;e wi&s;e Parti&s;ans, who concluded, the Government had hired two or three hundred hale Men, who looked like Fox-hunters, to be Bound and Pinion'd, if not to be Executed, as Repre&s;entatives of the pretended Captives. Their Victories in <HI>Scotland</HI> have been innumerable; and no longer ago than la&s;t Week, they gained a very remarkable One, in which the <HI>Highlan|ders</HI> cut off all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces to a Man; and afterwards di&s;gui&s;ing them&s;elves in their Habits, came up as Friends to the King's Troops, and put them all to the Sword. This Story had a great Run for a Day or two; and I believe one might &s;till find out a Whi&s;per among their &s;ecret Intelligence, that the Duke of <HI>Mar</HI> is a|ctually
<PB N="40" REF="49">
upon the Road to <HI>London,</HI> if not within two Days march of the Town. I need not take Notice, that their Succe&s;&s;es in the Battel of <HI>Dunblain</HI> are magnified among &s;ome of them to this Day; though a <HI>Tory</HI> may very well &s;ay with King <HI>Pyrrhus, That &s;uch another Victory would undo them.</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t fruitful Source of Fal&s;hood and Calumny, is that which, one would think, &s;hould be the lea&s;t apt to produce them; I mean a pretended Concern for the Safety of our E&s;ta|bli&s;hed Religion. Were the&s;e People as anxious for the Doctrines, which are e&s;&s;ential to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as they are for the nominal Di&s;tinction of adhering to its Intere&s;ts, they would know, that the &s;incere Ob&s;ervation of publick Oaths, Allegiance to their King, Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to their Bi&s;hops, Zeal again&s;t Popery, and Abhorrence of Rebellion, are the great Points that adorn the Character of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in which the Authors of the Reform|ed Religion in this Nation have always gloried. We ju&s;tly reproach the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who have adapt|ed all Chri&s;tianity to Temporal and Political Views, for maintaining a Po&s;ition &s;o repugnant to the Laws of Nature, Morality and Religion, That evil may be committed, for the &s;ake of Good, which may ari&s;e from it. But we cannot &s;uppo&s;e even this Principle, (as bad a One as it is) &s;hould influence tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who, by &s;o many ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous Fal&s;hoods, endea|vour to delude Men into a Belief of the Dan|ger of the Church. If there be any relying on the &s;olemn Declarations of a Prince, famed for keeping his Word, con&s;tant in the publick Ex|erci&s;es of our Religion, and determined in the Maintenance of our Laws, we have all the A&s;|&s;urances
<PB N="41" REF="50">
that can be given to us, for the Secu|rity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church under His Go|vernment. When a leading Man therefore be|gins to grow apprehen&s;ive for the Church, you may be &s;ure, that he is either in danger of lo&s;ing a Place, or in de&s;pair of getting one. It is plea|&s;ant on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, to &s;ee a notorious Pro|fligate &s;eized with a Concern for his Religion, and converting his Spleen into Zeal. The&s;e narrow and &s;elfish Views have &s;o great an In|fluence in this Cry, that, among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the Landed Intere&s;t, there are &s;eve|ral of my Fellow Free-Holders, who always fancy the Church in Danger upon the ri&s;ing of Bank-Stock. But the &s;tanding Ab&s;urdities, with|out the Belief of which no Man is reckoned a &s;taunch Churchman, are, That there is a Calves Head Club; for which (by the way) &s;ome pious <HI>Tory</HI> has made &s;uitable Hymns and Devotions: That there is a Confederacy among the greate&s;t part of the Prelates to de&s;troy Epi&s;copacy; and that all, who talk again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> are <HI>Presbyte|rians</HI> in their Hearts. The Emi&s;&s;aries of the Par|ty are &s;o diligent in &s;preading ridiculous Fictions of this Kind, that at pre&s;ent, if we may credit common Report, there are &s;everal remote Parts of the Nation in which it is firmly believed, that all the Churches in <HI>London</HI> are &s;hut up; and that if any Clergyman walks the Streets in his Habit, 'tis ten to one but he is knock'd down by &s;ome &s;turdy Schi&s;matick.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve upon this Occa&s;ion, that there are many particular Fal&s;hoods &s;uited to the par|ticular Climates and Latitudes in which they are publi&s;hed, according as the Situation of the Place makes them le&s;s liable to Di&s;covery: There is many a Lye, that will not thrive with|in
<PB N="42" REF="51">
a hundred Miles of <HI>London:</HI> Nay, we often find a Lye born in <HI>Southwark,</HI> that dies the &s;ame Day on this Side the Water: And &s;everal pro|duced in the loyal Ward of <HI>Port-&s;oken</HI> of &s;o feeble a Make, as not to bear Carriage to the <HI>Royal-Exchange.</HI> However, as the Mints of Calum|ny are perpetually at work, there are a great Number of curious Inventions i&s;&s;ued out from Time to Time, which grow current among the Party, and circulate through the whole King|dom.</P>
<P>As the De&s;ign of this Paper is not to exa&s;pe|rate, but to undeceive my Countreymen, let me de&s;ire them to con&s;ider the many Inconvenien|cies they bring upon them&s;elves by the&s;e mutu|al Intercour&s;es of Credulity and Fal&s;hood. I &s;hall only remind the Credulous of the &s;trong Delu&s;ion they have by this Means been led into the greate&s;t part of their Lives. Their hopes have been kept up by a Succe&s;&s;ion of Lyes for rear thirty Years. How many Per&s;ons have &s;tarved in Expectation of tho&s;e profitable Em|ployments, which were promi&s;ed them by the Authors of the&s;e Forgeries! How many of them have died with great Regret, when they thought they were within a Month of enjoying the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings of a Popi&s;h and Arbitrary Reign!</P>
<P>I would therefore advi&s;e this blinded Set of Men, not to give Credit to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, by whom they have been &s;o often fooled and impo|&s;ed upon; but on the contrary, to think it an Affront to their Parts, when they hear from any of them &s;uch Accounts, as they would not dare to tell them, but upon the Pre&s;umption that they are Ideots. Or if the Zeal for the Cau&s;e &s;hall di&s;po&s;e them to be Credulous in any Points
<PB N="43" REF="52">
that are favourable to it, I would beg of them not to venture Wagers upon the Truth of them: And in this pre&s;ent Conjuncture, by no means to &s;ell out of the Stocks upon any News they &s;hall hear from their good Friends at <HI>Perth.</HI> As the&s;e Party Fictions are the proper Subjects of Mirth and Laughter, their deluded Believers are only to be treated with Pity or Contempt. But as for tho&s;e Incendiaries of Figure and Di&s;tin|ction, who are the Inventors and Publi&s;hers of &s;uch gro&s;s Fal&s;hoods and Calumnies, they can|not be regarded by others, but with the utmo&s;t Dete&s;tation and Abhorrence; nor, one would think, by them&s;elves, without the greate&s;t Re|mor&s;e and Compunction of Heart; when they con&s;ider, that in order to give a Spirit to a de&s;pe|rate Cau&s;e, they have, by their fal&s;e and trea|cherous In&s;inuations and Reports, betrayed &s;o many of their Friends into their own De&s;tru|ction.</P>

<P>I Have heard that &s;everal Ladies of Di&s;tinction, upon the Reading of my Fourth Paper, are &s;tudying Methods how to make them&s;elves u&s;e|ful to the Publick. One has a De&s;ign of keep|ing an open Tea-Table, where every Man &s;hall be welcome that is a Friend to King <HI>George.</HI> Another is for &s;etting up an A&s;&s;embly for Ba&s;|&s;et, where none &s;hall be admitted to <HI>Punt,</HI> that
<PB N="44" REF="53">
have not taken the Oaths. A Third is upon an Invention of a Dre&s;s which will put every <HI>To|ry</HI> Lady out of Countenance: I am not in|formed of the Particulars, but am told in gene|ral, that &s;he has contrived to &s;hew her Principles by the &s;etting of her Commode; &s;o that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for any Woman, that is <HI>di&s;affected,</HI> to be in the Fa&s;hion. Some of them are of O|pinion that the Fan may be made u&s;e of with good Succe&s;s, again&s;t Popery, by exhibiting the Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in various Figures; and that their Abhorrence of the &s;uper|&s;titious U&s;e of Beads, may be very aptly ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the make of a Pearl Necklace. As for the Civil Part of our Con&s;titution, it is una|nimou&s;ly agreed among the Leaders of the Sex, that there is no Glory in making a Man their Slave, who has not naturally a Pa&s;&s;ion for Li|berty; and to di&s;allow of all Profe&s;&s;ions of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, but from a Lover to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It happens very luckily for the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> that their very Enemies acknowledge the fine&s;t Women of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to be of that Party. The <HI>Tories</HI> are forced to borrow their Toa&s;ts from their Antagoni&s;ts; and can &s;carce find Beauties enough of their own Side, to &s;up|ply a &s;ingle Round of <HI>October.</HI> One may, in|deed, &s;ometimes di&s;cover among the Malig|nants of the Sex, a Face that &s;eems to have been naturally de&s;igned for a <HI>Whig</HI> Lady: But then it is &s;o often flu&s;hed with Rage, or &s;owered with Di&s;appointments, that one cannot but be trou|bled to &s;ee it thrown away upon the Owner. Would the pretty Malecontent be per&s;uaded to love her King and Countrey, it would diffu&s;e a Chearfulne&s;s through all her Features, and give
<PB N="45" REF="54">
her quite another Air. I would therefore ad|vi&s;e the&s;e, my gentle Readers, as they con&s;ult the Good of their Faces, to forbear frowning upon Loyali&s;ts, and Pouting at the Govern|ment. In the mean Time, what may we not hope from a Cau&s;e, which is recommended by the Allurement of Beauty, and the Force of Truth! It is therefore to be hoped that every fine Woman will make this laudable U&s;e of her Charms; and that &s;he may not want to be frequently reminded of this great Duty, I will only de&s;ire her to think of her Countrey every Time &s;he looks in her Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;cribe &s;uch Rules, as &s;hall be &s;uitable to the Sex in general, I &s;hall con&s;ider them under their &s;everal Divi&s;i|ons of Maids, Wives and Widows.</P>
<P>As for Virgins, who are unexperienced in the Wiles of Men, they would do well to con&s;ider how little they are to rely on the Faith of Lo|vers, who in le&s;s than a Year have broken their Allegiance to their lawful Soveraign; and what Credit is to be given to the Vows and Prote&s;tati|ons of &s;uch as &s;hew them&s;elves &s;o little afraid of Perjury. Be&s;ides, what would an innocent young Lady think, &s;hould &s;he marry a Man without examining his Principles, and after|wards find her&s;elf got with Child by a Rebel?</P>
<P>In the next Place, every Wife ought to an|&s;wer for her Man. If the Husband be ingaged in a &s;editious Club, or drinks my&s;terious Healths, or be frugal of his Candles on a rejoycing Night, let her look to him, and keep him out of Harms way; or the World will be apt to &s;ay, &s;he has a Mind to be a Widow before her Time. She ought in &s;uch Ca&s;es to exert the Authority of the Curtain Lecture; and if &s;he finds him of a
<PB N="46" REF="55">
rebellious Di&s;po&s;ition, to tame him, as they do Birds of Prey, by dinning him in the Ears all Night long.</P>
<P>Widows may be &s;uppo&s;ed Women of too good Sen&s;e not to di&s;countenance all Practices, that have a Tendency to the De&s;truction of Man|kind. Be&s;ides they have a greater Intere&s;t in Property than either Maids or Wives, and do not hold their Jointures by the precarious Te|nure of Portions or Pin-Money. So that it is as unnatural for a Dowager, as a Free-Holder, to be an Enemy to our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>As nothing is more In&s;tructive than Exam|ples, I would recommend to the Peru&s;al of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Virgins the Story of <HI>Clelia</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Spin&s;ter, who&s;e Behaviour is repre&s;ented by all their Hi&s;torians, as one of the chief Motives that di&s;couraged the <HI>Tarquins</HI> from pro&s;ecuting their Attempt to regain the Throne, from whence they had been expelled. Let the Marry'd Wo|men reflect upon the Glory acquired by the Wife of <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> who, when her Husband, after long Exile, was returning into his Coun|trey with Fire and Sword, diverted him from &s;o cruel and unnatural an Enterprize. And let tho&s;e who have out lived their Hu&s;bands never forget their Countrey-woman Widow <HI>Boadicia,</HI> who headed her Troops, in Per&s;on again&s;t the Inva&s;ion of a <HI>Roman</HI> Army, and encouraged them with this memorable Saying, <HI>I, who am a Woman, am re&s;olv'd upon Victory or Death: But as for you who are Men, you may, if you plea&s;e, chu&s;e Life and Slavery.</HI></P>
<P>But I do not propo&s;e to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies, that they &s;hould turn <HI>Amazons</HI> in the Service of their Soveraign, nor &s;o much as let their Nails grow for the Defence of their Countrey. The

Men will take the Work of the Field off their Hands, and &s;hew the World, that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Va|lour cannot be matched, when it is animated by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beauty. I do not however di&s;ap|prove the Project which is now on Foot for a <HI>FEMALE ASSOCIATION</HI>; and, &s;ince I hear the fair Confederates cannot agree among them&s;elves upon a Form, &s;hall pre&s;ume to lay before them the following rough Draught, to be corrected or improved, as they in their Wi&s;|dom &s;hall think fit.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="58">
Defender of our Faith, DEFIANCE. Ha|ving &s;een a Libel, which you have lately pub|li&s;hed again&s;t the King and People of the&s;e Realms under the Title of a DECLARATION, We, <HI>in Ju&s;tice to the Sentiments of our own Hearts,</HI> have thought fit to return you the fol|lowing An&s;wer; wherein we &s;hall endeavour to reduce the Method the &s;everal Particulars, which you have contrived to throw together with much Malice, and no le&s;s Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>We believe you &s;incere in the fir&s;t Part of your Declaration, where you own it would be a great Satisfaction to you to be placed upon the Throne by our Endeavours: But you di&s;cou|rage us from making u&s;e of them, by declaring it to be your Right <HI>both by the Laws of God and Man.</HI> As for the Laws of God; we &s;hould think our&s;elves great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of them, &s;hould we for your Sake rebel again&s;t a Prince, who, under God, is the mo&s;t powerful Defen|der of that Religion which we think the mo&s;t plea&s;ing to Him: And as for the Laws of Man, we conceive tho&s;e to be of that Kind, which have been enacted from Time to Time for near thirty Years pa&s;t again&s;t you and your Preten&s;i|ons, by the Legi&s;lature of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>You afterwards proceed to Invectives again&s;t the Royal Family: Which we do a&s;&s;ure you is a very unpopular Topick, except to your few deluded Friends among the Rabble.</P>
<P>You call them <HI>Aliens to our Countrey,</HI> not con|&s;idering that King <HI>George</HI> has lived above a Year longer in <HI>England</HI> than ever you did. You &s;ay they are <HI>Di&s;tant in Blood,</HI> whereas no Body e|ver doubted that King <HI>George</HI> is great Grand&s;on to King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, though many believe that you are not Son to King <HI>James</HI> the Second.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="59">
Be&s;ides all the World acknowledges he is the neare&s;t to our Crown of the Prote&s;tant Blood, of which you cannot have one Drop in your Veins, unle&s;s you derive it from &s;uch Parents as you don't care for owning.</P>
<P>Your next Argument again&s;t the Royal Fa|mily, is, that they are <HI>Strangers to our Language:</HI> But they mu&s;t be Strangers to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court who have told you &s;o. However you mu&s;t know, that we plain Men &s;hould prefer a King who was a Stranger to our Language, before one who is a Stranger to our Laws and Reli|gion: For we could never endure <HI>French</HI> Sen|timents, though delivered in our native Dialect; and &s;hould abhor an arbitrary Prince, though he tyranniz'd over us in the fine&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that ever was &s;poken. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, Sir, we can|not bear the Thought of hearing a Man, that has been bred up in the Politicks of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, talk intelligibly from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, howe|ver he may boa&s;t of his &s;peaking <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he &s;ays his Prayers in an unknown Tongue.</P>
<P>We come now to the Grievances for which, in your Opinion, we ought to take up Arms a|gain&s;t our pre&s;ent Soveraign. The greate&s;t you &s;eem to in&s;i&s;t upon, and which is mo&s;t in the Mouths of your Party, is the Union of the two Kingdoms; for which his Maje&s;ty ought mo&s;t certainly to be depo&s;ed, becau&s;e it was made un|der the Reign of her, whom you call your <HI>Dear Si&s;ter of Glorious Memory.</HI> Other Grievances which you hint at under His Maje&s;ty's Admi|ni&s;tration, are, the Murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, who was Beheaded before King <HI>George</HI> was born; and the Sufferings of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, which perhaps His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty can|not
<PB N="51" REF="60">
wholly clear Him&s;elf of, becau&s;e He came into the World a Day before His Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>As on the one Side you arraign His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty by this mo&s;t extraordinary Retro&s;pect, on the other Hand you condemn His Govern|ment by what we may call the Spirit of Second Sight. You are not content to draw into His Reign tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs that were done a hundred Years ago, unle&s;s you anticipate tho&s;e that may happen a hundred Years hence. So that the keene&s;t of your Arrows either fall &s;hort of Him, or fly over his Head. We take it for a certain Sign that you are at a lo&s;s for pre&s;ent Grievan|ces, when you are thus forced to have recour&s;e to your <HI>future Pro&s;pects, and future Mi&s;eries.</HI> Now, Sir, you mu&s;t know, that we Free-Hol|ders have a natural Aver&s;ion to Hanging, and don't know how to an&s;wer it to our Wives and Families, if we &s;hould venture our Necks up|on the Truth of your Prophecies. In our ordi|nary Way of Judging, we gue&s;s at the King's future Conduct by what we have &s;een already; and therefore beg you will excu&s;e us if for the pre&s;ent we defer entring into a Rebellion, to which you &s;o graciou&s;ly invite us. When we have as bad a Pro&s;pect of our King <HI>George</HI>'s Reign, as we &s;hould have of yours, then will be your Time to date another Declaration from your Court at <HI>Commerci:</HI> Which, if we may be allowed to Prophecy in our Turn, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly happen before the hundred and fiftieth Year of your Reign.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the pa&s;t and future Grie|vances mentioned in your Declaration, we come now to the pre&s;ent; all of which are founded upon this Suppo&s;ition, That whatever is done by His Maje&s;ty or His Mini&s;ters to keep you out of
<PB N="52" REF="61">
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, is a Grievance. The&s;e, Sir, may be Grievances to you, but they are none to us. On the contrary, we look upon them as the greate&s;t In&s;tances of His Maje&s;ty's Care and Tenderne&s;s for His People. To take them in Order: The fir&s;t relates to the Mini&s;try; who are cho&s;en, as you ob&s;erve very rightly, out of the Wor&s;t, and not the Be&s;t of <HI>Your</HI> Subjects. Now, Sir, can you in Con&s;cience think us to be &s;uch Fools as to rebel again&s;t the King, for having employed tho&s;e who are His mo&s;t emi|nent Friends, and were the greate&s;t Sufferers in His Cau&s;e before He came to the Crown; and for having removed a General who is now a|ctually in Arms again&s;t him, and two Secreta|ries of State, both of whom have li&s;ted them|&s;elves in your Service; or becau&s;e He cho&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute in their Places &s;uch Men who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their Zeal again&s;t you, in the mo&s;t famous Battels, Negotiations, and Debates.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Grievance you mention, is, that the Glory of the late Queen has &s;uffered, who, you in&s;inuate, <HI>had &s;ecured to you the Enjoyment of that Inheritance out of which you had been &s;o long kept.</HI> This may indeed be a Rea&s;on why Her Memory &s;hall be precious with you: But you may be &s;ure we &s;hall think never the better of Her, for Her having your good Word. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on it makes us &s;tare, when we hear it objected to His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, <HI>That he is not kind to Her faithful Servants</HI>; &s;ince, if we can believe what you your&s;elf &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould be <HI>His faithful Servants.</HI> And by the way, many of your private Friends here wi&s;h you would forbear blabbing at this rate: For, to tell you a Secret, we are very apt to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="53" REF="62">
that any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, who de&s;erves your Prai&s;e, de&s;erves to be Hanged.</P>
<P>The next Grievance, which you have a migh|ty Mind to redre&s;s among us, is the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> again&s;t whom you bring a &s;tale Accu&s;ation which has been u&s;ed by every Minori|ty in the Memory of Man; namely, that it was procured by unwarrantable Influences and Cor|ruptions. We cannot indeed blame you for being angry at tho&s;e, who have &s;et &s;uch a round Price up|on your Head. Your Accu&s;ation of our High Court of Parliament, puts us in Mind of a Sto|ry, often told among us <HI>Free-Holders,</HI> concern|ing a rattle-brain'd young Fellow, who being indicted for two or three Pranks upon the High|way, told the Judge he would &s;wear the Peace a|gain&s;t him, for putting him in fear of his Life.</P>
<P>The next Grievance is &s;uch a one, that we are amazed how it could come into your Head. Your Words are as follow. <HI>Whil&s;t the Princi|pal Powers engaged in the late Wars do enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, and are attentive to di&s;charge their Debts, and ea&s;e their People,</HI> Great Britain <HI>in the mid&s;t of Peace, feels all the Load of War.</HI> New Debts <HI>are contracted,</HI> new Armies <HI>are rai|&s;ed at Home,</HI> Dutch <HI>Forces are brought into the&s;e Kingdoms.</HI> What in the Name of Wonder do you mean? Are you in earne&s;t, or do you de|&s;ign to banter us? Whom is the Nation obli|ged to for all this Load of War that it feels? Had you been wi&s;e enough to have &s;lept at <HI>Bar|le-duc</HI> in a whole Skin, we &s;hould not have contracted new Debts, rai&s;ed new Armies, or brought over <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces to make an Exam|ple of you.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plea&s;ant Grievance is &s;till behind, and indeed a mo&s;t proper one to clo&s;e up this Article.
<PB N="54" REF="63">
<HI>King</HI> George <HI>has taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutchy of</HI> Bremen<HI>, whereby a Door is opened to let in an In|nundation of Foreigners from Abroad, and to reduce the&s;e Nations to the State of a Province to one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Provinces of the Empire.</HI> And do you then really believe the Mob-Story, that King <HI>George</HI> de&s;igns to make a Bridge of Boats from <HI>Hanover</HI> to <HI>Wapping</HI>? We would have you know that &s;ome of us read <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle, and don't find that <HI>William</HI> the Con|queror ever thought of making <HI>England</HI> a Pro|vince to his Native Dutchy of <HI>Normandy,</HI> not|with&s;tanding it lay &s;o much more convenient for that Purpo&s;e: Nor that King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t had ever any Thoughts of reducing this Nation to the State of a Province to his ancient King|dom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though it lies upon the &s;ame Continent. But pray how comes it to pa&s;s that the Electorate of <HI>Hanover</HI> is become all of a &s;udden one of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Provinces of the Empire? If you undervalue it upon the Account of its Religion, you have &s;ome Rea|&s;on for what you &s;ay; though you &s;hould not think we are &s;uch Strangers to Maps, and live &s;o much out of the World, as to be ignorant that it is for Power and Extent the &s;econd Pro|te&s;tant State in <HI>Germany</HI>; and whether you know it or no, the Prote&s;tant Religion in the Empire, is looked upon as a &s;ufficient Balance again&s;t Po|pery. Be&s;ides, you &s;hould have con&s;idered that in your Declaration upon the King's coming to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> you endeavoured to ter|rify us from receiving him, by repre&s;enting him <HI>as a powerful foreign Prince, &s;upported by a numerous Army of his own Subjects.</HI> Be that as it will; we are no more afraid of being a Province to <HI>Hano|ver,</HI> than the <HI>Hanoverians</HI> are apprehen&s;ive of be|ing a Province to <HI>Bremen.</HI></P>

In the &s;ame pious Paragraph, <HI>You mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjure us to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Methods for your Re&s;toration, which the Finger of God &s;eems to point out to us.</HI> Now the only Methods which we can make u&s;e for that End, are, Civil War, Ra|pine, Blood&s;hed, Trea&s;on and Perjury; Methods which we Prote&s;tants do humbly conceive, can never be pointed out to us by the Finger of God.</P>
<P>The Re&s;t of your Declaration contains the Encouragements you give us to Rebell.

<P>ONE may venture to affirm, that all hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted <HI>Britons</HI> of what Party &s;o|ever, if they under&s;tood one another, are of the &s;ame Opinion in Points of Government: And that the Gro&s;s of the People, who are impo&s;ed upon by Terms which they do not comprehend, are <HI>Whigs</HI> in their Hearts. They are made to believe, that Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-Re&s;i|&s;tance, Unlimited Power and Indefea&s;ible Right, have &s;omething of a venerable and religious Meaning in them; whereas in Reality they on|ly imply, that a King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has a Right to be a Tyrant, and that his Subjects are obliged in Con&s;cience to be Slaves. Were the

Ca&s;e truly and fairly laid before them, they would know, that when they make a Profe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Principles, they renounce their legal Claim to Liberty and Property, and unwarily &s;ubmit to what they really abhor.</P>
<P>It is our Happine&s;s, under the pre&s;ent Reign, to hear our King from the Throne exhorting us to be <HI>zealous A&s;&s;ertors of the Liberties of our Coun|trey</HI>; which exclude all Preten&s;ions to an arbi|trary, tyrannick or de&s;potick Power. Tho&s;e, who have the Misfortune to live under &s;uch a Power, have no other Law but the Will of their Prince, and con&s;equently no Privileges, but what are precarious. For though in &s;ome arbitrary Governments there may be a Body of Laws ob&s;erved in the ordinary Forms of Ju&s;tice, they are not &s;ufficient to &s;ecure any Rights to the People; becau&s;e they may be di|&s;pen&s;ed with, or laid a&s;ide at the Plea&s;ure of the Soveraign.</P>
<P>And here it very much imports us to con&s;ider, that Arbitrary Power naturally tends to make a Man a bad Soveraign, who might po&s;&s;ibly have been a good One, had he been inve&s;ted with an Authority limited and circum&s;crib'd by Laws. None can doubt of this Tendency in Arbitrary Power, who con&s;ider, that it fills the Mind of Man with great and unrea&s;onable Conceits of Him&s;elf; rai&s;es Him into a Belief, that He is of a Superior Species to His Subjects; extingui&s;hes in Him the Principle of Fear, which is one of the greate&s;t Motives to all Duties; and creates an Ambition of magnifying Him&s;elf, by the Ex|ertion of &s;uch a Power in all its In&s;tances. So great is the Danger, that when a Soveraign can do what He will, He will do what He can.</P>

One of the mo&s;t Arbritary Princes in our Age was <HI>Muley I&s;hmael,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who, after a long Reign, dy'd about a Twelve Month ago This Prince was a Man of much Wit and natural Sen&s;e, of an active Temper, undaunted Courage, and great application. He was a De|&s;cendent of <HI>Mahomet</HI>; and &s;o exemplary for his Adherence to the Law of his Prophet, that he ab&s;tained all his Life from the Ta&s;te of Wine; began the annual Fa&s;t, or <HI>Lent</HI> of <HI>Ramadan</HI> two Months before his Subjects; was frequent in his Prayers; and that he might not want Opportu|nities of Kneeling, had fixed in all the &s;pacious Courts of his Palace large Con&s;ecrated Stones pointing towards the Ea&s;t, for any occa&s;ional Exerci&s;e of his Devotion. What might not have been hoped from a Prince of the&s;e Endow|ments, had they not all been rendered u&s;ele&s;s and ineffectual to the Good of his People by the Notion of that Power which they a&s;cribed to him! This will appear, if we con&s;ider how he exerci&s;ed it towards his Subjects in tho&s;e three great Points which are the chief Ends of Go|vernment, the Pre&s;ervation of their Lives, the Security of their Fortunes, and the Determina|tions of Ju&s;tice between Man and Man.</P>
<P>Foreign Envoys, who have given an Account of their Audiences, de&s;cribe this holy Man mounted on hor&s;eback in an open Court, with &s;everal of his <HI>Alcaydes,</HI> or Governours of Pro|vinces about him, &s;tanding bare foot, trembling, bowing to the Earth, and at every Word he &s;poke, breaking out into pa&s;&s;ionate Exclamati|ons of Prai&s;e, as, <HI>Great is the Wi&s;dom of our Lord the King; Our Lord the King &s;peaks as an Angel from Heaven.</HI> Happy was the Man among them, who was &s;o much a Favourite as to be
<PB N="60" REF="69">
&s;ent on an Errand to the mo&s;t remote Street in his Capital; which he performed with the great|e&s;t Alacrity, ran through every Puddle that lay in his Way, and took Care to return out of Breath and cover'd with Dirt, that he might &s;hew him&s;elf a diligent and faithful Mini&s;ter His Maje&s;ty at the &s;ame Time, to exhibit the Greatne&s;s of his Power, and &s;hew his Hor&s;e|man&s;hip, &s;eldom di&s;mi&s;s'd the Foreigner from his Pre&s;ence, 'till he had entertain'd him with the Slaughter of two or three of his Liege Sub|jects, whom he very dexterou&s;ly put to Death with the Tilt of his Launce. St. <HI>Olon,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Envoy, tells us, that when he had his la&s;t Audience of him, he receiv'd him in Robes ju&s;t &s;tain'd with an Execution; and that he was blooded up to his Elbows by a Couple of <HI>Moors,</HI> whom he had been butchering with his own Im|perial Hands. By the Calculation of that Au|thor, and many Others, who have &s;ince given an Account of his Exploits, we may reckon that by his own Arm he killed above Forty Thou&s;and of his People. To render him&s;elf the more awful, he cho&s;e to wear a Garb of a particular Colour when he was bent upon Exe|cutions; &s;o that when he appear'd in Yellow his Great Men hid them&s;elves in Corners, and dur&s;t not pay their Court to him, till he had &s;a|tiated his Thir&s;t of Blood by the Death of &s;ome of his loyal Commoners, or of &s;uch unwary Officers of State as chanc'd to come in his Way. Upon this Account we are told, that the fir&s;t News enquir'd after every Morning at <HI>Mequinez,</HI> was, Whether the Emperour were &s;tirring, and in a good or bad Humour? As this Prince was a great Admirer of Architecture, and employ'd many Thou&s;ands in Works of
<PB N="61" REF="70">
that Kind, if he did not approve the Plan or the Performance, it was u&s;ual for him to &s;hew the Delicacy of his Ta&s;te by demoli&s;hing the Building, and putting to Death all that had a Hand in it. I have heard but of one In&s;tance of his Mercy; which was &s;hewn to the Ma&s;ter of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el. This our Countreyman pre|&s;ented him with a curious Hatchet, which he receiv'd very graciou&s;ly; and asking him whe|ther it had a good Edge, try'd it upon the Do|nor, who &s;lipping a&s;ide from the Blow, e&s;cap'd with the Lo&s;s only of his right Ear; for Old <HI>Muley,</HI> upon &s;econd Thoughts, con&s;idering that it was not one of his own Subjects, &s;topp'd his Hand, and would not &s;end him to Paradi&s;e. I cannot quit this Article of his Tenderne&s;s for the Lives of his People, without mentioning one of his Queens, whom he was remarkably fond of; as al&s;o a Favourite Prime Mini&s;ter, who was very dear to him. The fir&s;t dy'd by a Kick of her Lord the King, when &s;he was big with Child, for having gather'd a Flower as &s;he was walking with him in his Plea&s;ure Gar|den. The Other was ba&s;tinado'd to Death by his Maje&s;ty; who, repenting of the Drubs he had given him when it was too late, to mani|fe&s;t his E&s;teem for the Memory of &s;o Worthy a Man, executed the Surgeon that could not cure him.</P>
<P>This Ab&s;olute Monarch was as notable a Guardian of the Fortunes, as of the Lives of his Subjects. When any Man among his Peo|ple grew rich, in Order to keep him from be|ing dangerous to the State, he u&s;ed to &s;end for all his Goods and Chattels. His Governours of Towns and Provinces, who form'd them|&s;elves upon the Example of their <HI>Grand Mo|narque,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="71">
practi&s;ed Rapine, Violence, Extortion, and all the Arts of De&s;potick Government in their re&s;pective Di&s;tricts, that they might be the better enabled to make him their yearly Pre|&s;ents. For the greate&s;t of his Viceroys could only propo&s;e to him&s;elf a comfortable Sub&s;i|&s;tence out of the Plunder of his Province, and was in certain Danger of being recall'd or hang'd, if he did not remit the Bulk of it to his Dread Soveraign. That he might make a right U&s;e of the&s;e Prodigious Trea&s;ures, which flow'd in to him from all the Parts of his wide Empire, he took Care to bury them under Ground, by the Hands of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty Slaves, and then cut their Throats, as the mo&s;t effectual Method to keep them from making Di&s;cove|ries. The&s;e were his <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> for rai|&s;ing Money, by which he weaken'd the Hands of the Factious, and in any Ca&s;e of Emergency, could employ the whole Wealth of his Empire, which he had thus ama&s;&s;ed together in his &s;ub|terraneous Exchequer.</P>
<P>As there is no &s;uch Thing as Property under an Arbitrary Government, you may learn what was <HI>Muley I&s;hmael</HI>'s Notion of it from the fol|lowing Story Being upon the Road, amid&s;t his Life-Guards, a little before the Time of the <HI>Ram-Fea&s;t,</HI> he met one of his <HI>Alcaydes</HI> at the Head of his Servants, who were driving a great Flock of Sheep to Market. The Emperor ask'd who&s;e they were: The <HI>Alcayde</HI> an&s;wered with profound Submi&s;&s;ion, <HI>They are mine,</HI> O I&s;hmael<HI>, Son of</HI> Elcherif<HI>, of the Line of</HI> Ha&s;&s;an. Thine! <HI>thou Son of a Cuckold,</HI> &s;aid this SERVANT OF THE LORD, <HI>I thought I had been the only Pro|prietor in this Countrey</HI>; upon which he run him through the Body with his Launce, and very
<PB N="63" REF="72">
piou&s;ly di&s;tributed the Sheep among his Guards, for the Celebration of the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>His Determinations of Ju&s;tice between Man and Man, were indeed very &s;ummary and deci|&s;ive, and generally put an End to the Vexations of a Law-Suit, by the Ruin both of Plaintiff and Defendant. Travellers have recorded &s;ome Samples of this Kind, which may give us an Idea of the Ble&s;&s;ings of his Admini&s;tration. One of his <HI>Alcaydes</HI> complaining to him of a Wife, whom he had received from his Maje|&s;ty's Hands, and therefore could not divorce her, that &s;he u&s;ed to pull him by the Beard; the Emperor to redre&s;s this Grievance, order'd his Beard to be plucked up by the Roots, that he might not be liable to any more &s;uch Af|fronts. A Countrey Farmer having accus'd &s;ome of his Negro Guards for Robbing him of a Drove of Oxen, the Emperor readily &s;hot the Offenders: But afterwards demanding Repara|tion of the Accu&s;er, for the Lo&s;s of &s;o many Brave Fellows, and finding him in&s;olvent, com|pounded the Matter with him by taking away his Life. There are many other In&s;tances of the &s;ame Kind. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve however under this Head, that the only good Thing he is celebrated for, during his whole Reign, was the clearing of the Roads and High-Ways of Robbers, with which they u&s;ed to be very much infe&s;ted. But his Method was to &s;lay Man, Woman and Child, who lived within a certain Di&s;tance from the Place, where the Robbery was committed. This extraordinary Piece of Ju&s;tice could not but have its Effect, by making every Road in his Empire un&s;afe for the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a Free-Booter.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="73">
I mu&s;t not omit this Emperor's Reply to Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ly Shovel,</HI> who had taken &s;everal of his Subjects by Way of Reprizal for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captives that were detained in his Dominions. Upon the Admiral's offering to exchange them on very advantageous Terms, this good Empe|ror &s;ent him Word, The Subjects he had taken were poor Men, not worth the Ran&s;oming; and that he might throw them over Board, or de&s;troy them otherwi&s;e as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such was the Government of <HI>Muley I&s;hmael, The Servant of God, the Emperor of the Faithful, who was Courageous in the Way of the Lord, the Noble, the Good.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Account, which is extracted from the be&s;t Authorities. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that he was a great Admirer of His late Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty.

<Q>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BY our late&s;t Advices, both from Town and Countrey, it appears, that the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are <HI>able to bear Arms,</HI> that is, to Smile or Frown to any Purpo&s;e, have alrea|dy begun to commit Ho&s;tilities upon the Men of each oppo&s;ite Party. To this End we are a&s;|&s;ared, that many of them on both Sides <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> before their Gla&s;&s;es every Morning; that they have already ca&s;hiered &s;everal of their Followers as Mutineers, who have contradicted them in &s;ome political Conver&s;ations; and that the <HI>Whig</HI> Ladies in particular de&s;ign very &s;oon to have a general Review of their Forces at a Play be&s;poken by one of their Leaders. This Sett of Ladies, indeed, as they daily do Duty at Court, are much more expert in the U&s;e of their Airs and Graces than their female Antagoni&s;ts, who are mo&s;t of them bred in the Countrey: So that the Si&s;terhood of Loyali&s;ts, in re&s;pect of the fair Malecontents, are like an Army of regular Forces, compared with a raw undi&s;ciplined Mi|litia.</P>
<P>It is to this Misfortune in their Education that we may a&s;cribe the rude and opprobrious Lan|guage with which the di&s;affected Part of the Sex treat the pre&s;ent Royal Family. A little lively
<PB N="66" REF="75">
Ru&s;tick, who hath been trained up in Ignorance and Prejudice, will prattle Trea&s;on a whole Winter's Evening, and &s;tring together a Parcel of &s;illy &s;editious Stories, that are equally void of Decency and Truth. Nay, you &s;ometimes meet with a zealous Matron, who &s;ets up for the Pattern of a Pari&s;h, uttering &s;uch Invectives as are highly misbecoming her, both as a Wo|man and a Subject. In an&s;wer therefore to &s;uch di&s;toyal Termagants, I &s;hall repeat to them a Speech of the hone&s;t and blunt Duke <HI>du Sully</HI> to an A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Ladies, who were rail|ing very bitterly again&s;t <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, at his Acce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>French</HI> Throne; <HI>Ladies,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you have a very good King, if you know when you are well. However &s;et your Hearts at re&s;t, for he is not a Man to be &s;colded or &s;eratched out of his Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>But as I never care to &s;peak of the fair Sex, unle&s;s I have an Occa&s;ion to Prai&s;e them, I &s;hall take my Leave of the&s;e ungentle Dam&s;els; and only beg of them, not to make them&s;elves le&s;s amiable than Nature de&s;igned them, by be|ing Rebels to the Be&s;t of their Abilities, and en|deavouring to bring their Countrey into Blood|&s;hed and Confu&s;ion. Let me therefore recom|mend to them the Example of tho&s;e beautiful A&s;&s;ociates, whom I mentioned in my eighth Pa|per, as I have received the Particulars of their Behaviour from the Per&s;on with whom I lodged their A&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;ociation being written at length in a large Roll of the fine&s;t Vellum, with three di|&s;tinct Columns for the Maids, Wives, and Wi|dows, was opened for the Sub&s;cribers near a Fortnight ago. Never was a Sub&s;cription for a <HI>Raffiing</HI> or an <HI>Opera</HI> more crowded. There is
<PB N="67" REF="76">
&s;carce a celebrated Beauty about Town that you may not find in one of the three Li&s;ts; in&s;o|much, that if a Man, who did not know the De&s;ign, &s;hould read only the Names of the Sub&s;cribers, he would fancy every Column to be a Catalogue of Toa&s;ts. Mr. <HI>Motteux</HI> has been heard to &s;ay more than once, that if he had the Portraits of all the A&s;&s;ociates, they would make a finer Auction of Pictures, than he or any Body el&s;e had ever exhibited.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Ladies indeed critici&s;ed upon the Form of the A&s;&s;ociation. One of them, af|ter the Peru&s;al of it, wondered that among the Features to be u&s;ed in Defence of their Coun|trey, there was no mention made of <HI>Teeth</HI>; up|on which &s;he &s;miled very charmingly, and di&s;|covered as fine a Sett as ever Eye beheld. A|nother, who was a tall lovely Prude, holding up her Head in a mo&s;t maje&s;tick Manner, &s;aid, with &s;ome Di&s;dain. She thought a <HI>good Neck</HI> might have done His Maje&s;ty as much Service as Smiles or Dimples. A Third looked upon the A&s;&s;ociation as defective, becau&s;e &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry a Word as <HI>Hands</HI> was omitted; and by her Manner of taking up the Pen, it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s the Rea&s;on of her Objection.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons who a&s;&s;ociated, have done much more than by the Letter of the A&s;|&s;ociation they were obliged to; having not on|ly &s;et their Names to it, but &s;ub&s;cribed their &s;e|veral Aids and Sub&s;idies for the carrying on &s;o good a Cau&s;e. In the Virgin Column is one who &s;ub&s;cribes fifteen Lovers, all of them good Men and true. There is another who &s;ub&s;cribes five Admirers, with one tall hand&s;om black Man fit to be a Colonel. In &s;hort, there is &s;carce one in this Li&s;t who does not engage
<PB N="68" REF="77">
her&s;elf to &s;upply a Quota of brisk young Fellows many of them already equipt with Hats and Feathers. Among the re&s;t, was a pretty &s;pright|ly Coquette, with &s;parkling Eyes, who &s;ub-&s;cribed two Quivers of Arrows.</P>
<P>In the Column of Wives, the fir&s;t who took Pen in Hand writ her own Name and one Va&s;|&s;al, meaning her Husband. Another &s;ub&s;cribes her Husband and three Sons. Another her Husband and &s;ix Coach-Hor&s;es. Mo&s;t in this Catalogue paired them&s;elves with their re&s;pe|ctive Mates, an&s;wering for'em as Men of hone&s;t Principles, and fit for the Service.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> There were two in this Column that wore A&s;&s;ociation Ribbons: The fir&s;t of them &s;ub&s;cribed her Husband, and her Husband's Friend; the &s;econd a Husband and five Lovers; but upon enquiry into their Characters, they are both of them found to be <HI>Tories,</HI> who hung out fal&s;e Colours to be Spies upon the A&s;&s;ociation, or to in&s;inuate to the World by their Sub&s;crip|tions, as if a Lady of <HI>Whig</HI> Principles could love any Man be&s;ides her Husband.</P>
<P>The Widows Column is headed by a fine Wo|man who calls her&s;elf <HI>Boadicea,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cribes &s;ix hundred Tenants. It was indeed ob&s;erved that the Strength of the A&s;&s;ociation lay mo&s;t in this Column; every Widow, in Proportion to her Jointure, having a great Number of Admi|rers, and mo&s;t of them di&s;tingui&s;hed as able Men. Tho&s;e who have examined this Li&s;t, compute that there may be three Regiments rai|&s;ed out of it, in which there &s;hall not be one Man under fix Foot high.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude this Account, without taking Notice of the ASSOCIATION-RIB|BON, by which the&s;e Beautiful Confederates
<PB N="69" REF="78">
have agreed to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves. It is in|deed &s;o very pretty an Ornament, that I won|der any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman will be without it. <HI>A Lady of the</HI> ASSOCIATION who bears this Badge of Allegiance upon her Brea&s;t, natura|ly produces a De&s;ire in every Male-Beholder, of gaining a Place in a Heart which carries on it &s;uch a vi&s;ible Mark of its Fidelity. When the Beauties of our I&s;land are thus indu&s;trious to &s;hew their Principles as well as their Charms, they rai&s;e the Sentiments of their Countrey|men, and in&s;pire them at the &s;ame time both with Loyalty and Love. What Numbers of Pro&s;elytes may we not expect, when the mo&s;t amiable of the <HI>Britons</HI> thus exhibit to their Admi|rers the only Terms upon which they are to hope for any Corre&s;pondence or Alliance with them! It is well known that the greate&s;t Blow the <HI>French</HI> Nation ever receiv'd, was the dropping of a fine Lady's Garter, in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. The mo&s;t remarkable Battels which have been &s;ince gained over that Nation, were fought under the Au&s;pices of a Blue RIBBON. As our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies have &s;till the &s;ame Faces, and our Men the &s;ame Hearts, why may we not hope for the &s;ame glorious Atchievements from the Influence of this Beautiful Brea&s;t-Knot?</P>

<P>THIS Day having been &s;et apart by Publick Authority to rai&s;e in us an Abhorrence of the <HI>GREAT REBELLION,</HI> which in|volved this Nation in &s;o many Calamities, and ended in the Murder of their Soveraign; it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to &s;hew the Guilt of Rebel|lion in general, and of that Rebellion in par|ticular which is &s;tirred up again&s;t His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>That Rebellion is one of the mo&s;t hainous Crimes which it is in the Power of Man to commit, may appear from &s;everal Con&s;iderati|ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as it de&s;troys the End of all Govern|ment, and the Benefits of Civil Society. Go|vernment was in&s;tituted for maintaining the Peace, Safety, and Happine&s;s of a People. The&s;e great Ends are brought about by a gene|ral Conformity and Submi&s;&s;ion to that Frame of Laws which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in every Communi|ty, for the Protection of the Innocent, and the Puni&s;hment of the Guilty. As on the one Side Men are &s;ecured the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Lives, Properties, and every Thing they have a Right to: So on the other Side, tho&s;e who
<PB N="71" REF="80">
offer them any Injury in the&s;e Particulars, are &s;ubject to Penalties proportioned to their re|&s;pective Offences. Government therefore mi|tigates the Inequality of Power among particu|lar Per&s;ons, and makes an innocent Man, tho' of the lowe&s;t Rank, a Match for the Mightie&s;t of his Fellow-Subjects; &s;ince he has the Force of the whole Community on his Side, which is able to controul the In&s;olence or Inju&s;tice of any private Oppre&s;&s;or. Now Rebellion di&s;ap|points all the&s;e Ends and Benefits of Govern|ment, by rai&s;ing a Power in Oppo&s;ition to that Authority which has been e&s;tabli&s;hed among a People for their mutual Welfare and Defence. So that Rebellion is as great an Evil to Society, as Government it&s;elf is a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the next Place, Rebellion is a Violation of all tho&s;e Engagements, which every Govern|ment exacts from &s;uch Per&s;ons as live under it; and con&s;equently, the mo&s;t ba&s;e and pernicious In&s;tance of Treachery and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. The Guilt of Rebellion Increa&s;es in Proportion as the&s;e Engagements are more Solemn and Ob|ligatory. Thus if a Man makes his Way to Rebellion through Perjury, he gives additional Horrors to that Crime, which is in it&s;elf of the blacke&s;t Nature.</P>
<P>We may likewi&s;e con&s;ider Rebellion as a greater Complication of Wickedne&s;s than any other Crime we can commit. It is big with Repine, Sacrilege, and Murder. It is dreadful in its milde&s;t Effects, as it impoveri&s;hes the Pub|lick; ruins particular Families; begets and per|petuates Hatreds among Fellow-Subjects, Friends, and Relations; makes a Countrey the Seat or War and De&s;olation, and expo&s;es it to the Attempts of its foreign Enemies. In &s;hort,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
as it is impo&s;&s;ible for it to take Effect, or to make the &s;malle&s;t Progre&s;s, but through a con|tinued Cour&s;e of Violence and Blood&s;hed; a Robber or a Murderer looks like an Innocent Man, when we compare him with a Rebel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that as in the Subordinati|ons of a Government the King is offended by any In&s;ults or Oppo&s;itions to an inferior Magi|&s;trate; &s;o the Soveraign Ruler of the Univer&s;e is affronted by a Breach of Allegiance to tho&s;e whom he has &s;et over us; Providence having delegated to the Supream Magi&s;trate in every Countrey the &s;ame Power for the Good of Men, which that Supreme Magi&s;trate transfer to tho&s;e &s;everal Officers and Sub&s;titutes who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> under Him, for the pre&s;erving of Order and Ju+&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now if we take a View of the pre&s;ent Rebel+lion which is formed again&s;t His Maje&s;ty, we &s;hall find in it all the Guilt that is naturally inhe+rent in this Crime, without any &s;ingle Circum+&s;tance to alleviate it. In&s;urrections among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> People to re&s;cue them&s;elves from the mo&s;t vio+lent and illegal Oppre&s;&s;ions; to throw off a Ty+ranny that makes Property precarious, and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> painful; to pre&s;erve their Laws and their Reli+gion to them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity; are ex+cu&s;ed from the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an Underta+king, when no other Means are left for the Se+curity of every Thing that is dear and valua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to rea&s;onable Creatures. By the Frame of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Con&s;titution, the Duties of Protection and Alle+giance are reciprocal; and as the Safety of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Community is the ultimate End and De&s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Government, when this, in&s;tead of being pre+&s;erved, is manife&s;tly de&s;troy'd, Civil Societi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> are excu&s;able before God and Man, if they en+

deavour to recover them&s;elves out of &s;o mi&s;era|ble a Condition. For in &s;uch a Ca&s;e Govern|ment becomes an Evil in&s;tead of a Ble&s;&s;ing, and is not at all preferable to a State of Anarchy and mutual Independence. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, we have &s;carce ever yet heard of an In&s;urrection that was not either coloured with Grievances of the highe&s;t Kind, or countenanced by one or more Branches of the Legi&s;lature. But the pre|&s;ent Rebellion is form'd again&s;t a King, who&s;e Right has been e&s;tabli&s;h'd by frequent Parlia|ments of all Parties, and recogniz'd by the mo&s;t &s;olemn Oaths; who has not been charged with one illegal Proceeding; who acts in perfect Con|cert with the Lords and Commons of the Realm; who is famed for his Equity and Goodne&s;s, and has already very much advanc'd the Reputation and Intere&s;t of our Countrey. The Guilt there|fore of this Rebellion has in it all the mo&s;t ag|gravating Circum&s;tances; which will &s;till ap|pear more plainly, if we con&s;ider in the fir&s;t Place the real Motives to it.</P>
<P>The Rebellion, which was one of the mo&s;t flagitious in it&s;elf, and de&s;crib'd with the mo&s;t Horrour by Hi&s;torians, is that of <HI>Catiline</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates. Their Motives to it are di&s;play'd at large by the <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, in order to in|&s;pire the Reader with the utmo&s;t Dete&s;tation of it. <HI>Catiline</HI> the Chief of the Rebellion, had been di&s;appointed in his Competition for one of the fir&s;t Offices in the Government, and had in|volved him&s;elf in &s;uch private Debts and Diffi|culties, as nothing could extricate him out of, but the Ruin of an Admini&s;tration that would not entru&s;t him with Po&s;ts of Honour or Profit. His principal Accomplices were Men of the &s;ame Character, and animated by the &s;ame In|centives.
<PB N="74" REF="83">
They complained that Power was lodged in the Hands of the Wor&s;t, to the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Be&s;t; and that Places were con|ferred on unworthy Men, to the Exclu&s;ion of them&s;elves and their Friends. Many of them were afraid of publick Ju&s;tice for pa&s;t Crimes, and &s;ome of them &s;tood actually condemned as Traitors to their Countrey. The&s;e were joined by Men of de&s;perate Fortunes, who hoped to find their Account in the Confu&s;ions of their Countrey, were applauded by the meane&s;t of the Rabble, who always delighted in Change, and privately abetted by Per&s;ons of a con&s;iderable Figure, who aimed at tho&s;e Honours and Prefer|ments which were in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Ri|vals. The&s;e are the Motives with which <HI>Cati|line</HI>'s Rebellion is branded in Hi&s;tory, and which are expre&s;&s;ly mentioned by <HI>Sallu&s;t.</HI> I &s;hall leave it to every unprejudiced Reader to compare them with the Motives which have kindled the pre&s;ent Rebellion in His Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P>As this Rebellion is of the mo&s;t criminal Na|ture from its Motives, &s;o it is likewi&s;e if we con&s;ider its Con&s;equences. Should it Succeed, (a Suppo&s;ition which, God be thanked, is very extravagant) what mu&s;t be the natural Effects of it upon our Religion! What could we expect from an Army, ble&s;t by the Pope, headed by a zealous <HI>Roman-Catholick,</HI> encouraged by the mo&s;t bigotted Princes of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;upported by Contributions not only from the&s;e &s;everal Potentates, but from the Wealthie&s;t of their Convents, and officer'd by <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts and Outlaws! Can we imagine that the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> of our own Nation would &s;o heartily embark in an Enterprize, to the vi&s;ible Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, did they only hope
<PB N="75" REF="84">
to enjoy their Religion under tho&s;e Laws which are now in Force? In &s;hort, the Danger to the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e is &s;o manife&s;t, that it would be an Affront to the Under&s;tanding of the Reader to endeavour farther to prove it.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t common, and indeed the mo&s;t natural Divi&s;ion of all Offences, is into tho&s;e of Omi&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e of Commi&s;&s;ion. We may make the &s;ame Divi&s;ion of that par|ticular Set of Crimes which regard Human So|ciety. The greate&s;t Crime which can be com|mitted again&s;t it is Rebellion; as was &s;hewn in my la&s;t Paper. The greate&s;t Crime of Omi&s;&s;i|on, is an Indifference in the particular Members of a Society, when a Rebellion is actually be|gun among them. In &s;uch a Juncture, though a Man may be innocent of the great Breach which is made upon Government, he is highly culpable, if he does not u&s;e all the Means that are &s;uitable to his Station for reducing the Com|munity into its former State of Peace and good Order.</P>
<P>Our Obligation to be active on &s;uch an Oc|ca&s;ion appears from the very Nature of Civil Government; which is an In&s;titution, where|by we are all confederated together for our mu|tual Defence and Security. Men who profe&s;s a State of Neutrality in Times of Publick Dan|ger, de&s;ert the Common Intere&s;t of their Fel|low-Subjects; and act with Independence to that Con&s;titution into which they are incorpora|ted. The Safety of the whole requires our joint Endeavours. When this is at Stake, the indif|ferent are not properly a Part of the Commu|nity;
<PB N="78" REF="87">
or rather are like dead Limbs, which are an Incumbrance to the Body, in&s;tead of being of U&s;e to it. Be&s;ides that, the Protection which all receive from the &s;ame Government, ju&s;tly calls upon the Gratitude of All to Strengthen it, as well as upon their Self-Intere&s;t to pre|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>But farther; If Men, who in their Hearts are Friends to a Government, forbear giving it their utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t its Enemies, they put it in the Power of a few de&s;perate Men to ruine the Welfare of tho&s;e who are much &s;upe|rior to them in Strength, Number, and Intere&s;t. It was a remarkable Law of <HI>Solon,</HI> the great Le|gi&s;lator of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that any Per&s;on who in the Civil Tumults and Commotions of the Republick remained Neuter, or an indifferent Spectator of the contending Parties, &s;hould, af|ter the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the publick Peace, forfeit all his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and be condemned to perpetual Bani&s;hment. This Law made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for every Citizen to take his Party, be|cau&s;e it was highly probable the Majority would be &s;o Wi&s;e as to e&s;pou&s;e that Cau&s;e which was mo&s;t agreeable to the publick Weal, and by that Means hinder a Sedition from making a &s;ucce&s;s|ful Progre&s;s. At lea&s;t, as every prudent and hone&s;t Man, who might otherwi&s;e favour any Indolence in his own Temper, was hereby en|gaged to be active, &s;uch a one would be &s;ure to join him&s;elf to that Side which had the Good of their Countrey mo&s;t at Heart. For this Rea|&s;on their famous Lawgiver condemned the Per|&s;ons who &s;ate Idle in Divi&s;ions &s;o dangerous to the Government, as Aliens to the Community, and therefore to be cut off from it as unprofita|ble Members.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="88">
Further; Indifference cannot but be crimi|nal, when it is conver&s;ant about Objects which are &s;o far from being of an indifferent Nature, that they are of the highe&s;t Importance to our &s;elves and our Countrey. If it be indifferent to us whether we are Free-Subjects or Slaves; whether our Prince be of our own Religion, or of one that obliges him to extirpate it; we are in the right to give our&s;elves no trouble in the pre&s;ent Juncture. A Man governs him&s;elf by the Dictates of Virtue and good Sen&s;e, who acts without Zeal or Pa&s;&s;ion in Points that are of no Con&s;equences: But when the whole Commu|nity is &s;haken, and the Safety of the Publick en|danger'd, the Appearance of a Philo&s;ophical or an affected Indolence mu&s;t ari&s;e either from Stupidity, or Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>When in the Divi&s;ion of Parties among us, Men only &s;trove for the fir&s;t Place in the Prince's Favour; when all were attached to the &s;ame Form of Government, and contended on|ly for the highe&s;t Offices in it; a prudent and an hone&s;t Man might look upon the Struggle with Indifference, and be in no great Pain for the Suc|ce&s;s of either Side. But at pre&s;ent the Conte&s;t is not in Reality between <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> but between <HI>Loyali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Rebels.</HI> Our Countrey is not now divided into two Parties, who propo&s;e the &s;ame End by different Means; but into &s;uch as would pre&s;erve, and &s;uch as would de&s;troy it. Whatever Denominations we might range our &s;elves under in former Times, Men who have any natural Love to their Countrey, or Sen&s;e of their Duty, &s;hould exert their united Strength in a Cau&s;e that is common to all Parties, as they are Prote&s;tants and <HI>Britons.</HI> In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, an avowed Indifference is Treachery to our Fel|low-Subjects;
<PB N="80" REF="89">
and a Lukewarm Allegiance&punc; may prove as pernicious in its Con&s;equences as Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>I need not repeat here what I have proved at large in a former Paper, that we are obliged to an active Obedience by the &s;olemn Oaths we have taken to His Maje&s;ty; and that the neutral Kind of Indifference, which is the Subject of this Paper, falls &s;hort of that Obligation they lie un|der, who have taken &s;uch Oaths; as will ea&s;ily appear to any one who con&s;iders the Form of tho&s;e &s;acred and religious Engagements.</P>
<P>How then can any Man an&s;wer it to him&s;elf, if, for the &s;ake of managing his Intere&s;t or Cha|racter among a Party, or out of any per&s;onal Pique to tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t con&s;picuous for their Zeal in His Maje&s;ty's Service, or from a|ny other private and &s;elf-intere&s;ted Motive, he &s;tands as a Looker on when the Government is attacked by an open Rebellion; e&s;pecially when tho&s;e engaged in it, cannot have the lea&s;t Pro|&s;pect of Succe&s;s, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the an|cient and hereditary Enemies to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Na|tion. It is &s;trange that the&s;e Luke warm Friends to the Government, who&s;e Zeal for their Sove|raign ri&s;es and falls with their Credit at Court, do not con&s;ider, before it be too late, that as they &s;trengthen the Rebels by their pre&s;ent In|difference, they at the &s;ame time e&s;tabli&s;h the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e who are their Rivals and Com|petitors for publick Po&s;ts of Honour. When there is an End put to this Rebellion, the&s;e Gen|tlemen cannot pretend to have had any Merit in &s;o good a Work: And they may well believe the Nation will never care to &s;ee tho&s;e Men it the highe&s;t Offices of Tru&s;t, who when they an out of them, will not &s;tir a Finger in its De+fence.</P>

<P>HAVING in the Seventh Paper con&s;ider'd many of tho&s;e Fal&s;hoods, by which the Cau&s;e of our Malecontents is &s;upported; I &s;hall here &s;peak of that extravagant Credulity, which di&s;po&s;es each particular Member of their Party to believe them. This &s;trange Alacrity in Be|lieving Ab&s;urdity and Incon&s;i&s;tence may be cal|led the <HI>Political Faith</HI> of a Tory.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on who is thoroughly endowed with this Political Faith, like a Man in a Dream, is entertained from one end of his Life to the o|ther with Objects that have no Reality or Exi|&s;tence. He is daily nouri&s;hed and kept in Hu|mour by Fiction and Delu&s;ion; and may be compared to the old ob&s;tinate Knight in <HI>Rabe|lais,</HI> that every Morning &s;wallowed a Chimera for his Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>This Political Faith of a Malecontent is al|together founded on Hope. He does not give Credit to any thing becau&s;e it is probable, but be|cau&s;e it is plea&s;ing. His Wi&s;hes &s;erve him in|&s;tead of Rea&s;ons, to confirm the Truth of what he hears. There is no Report &s;o incredible or contradictory in it&s;elf which he doth not chear|fully
<PB N="82" REF="91">
believe, if it tends to the Advancement of the Cau&s;e. In &s;hort, a Malecontent who is a good Believer has generally rea&s;on to repeat the celebrated Rant of an Ancient Father, <HI>Credo quia impo&s;&s;ibile e&s;t:</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>It mu&s;t be True, becau&s;e it is Impo&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>It has been very well ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t credulous Man in the World is the Athei&s;t, who believes the Univer&s;e to be the Production of Chance. In the &s;ame Manner a Tory, who is the greate&s;t Believer in what is improbable, is the greate&s;t Infidel in what is certain. Let a Friend to the Government relate to him a Matter of Fact, he turns away his Ear from him, and gives him the Lye in every Look. But if one of his own Stamp &s;hould tell him that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would be &s;uddenly at <HI>Perth,</HI> and that his Army is now actually marching thither up|on the Ice; he hugs him&s;elf at the good News, and gets Drunk upon it before he goes to Bed. This &s;ort of People puts one in Mind of &s;everal Towns in <HI>Europe</HI> that are inacce&s;&s;ible on the one Side, while they lie open and unguard|ed on the other. The Minds of our Malecon|tents are indeed &s;o depraved with tho&s;e Fal&s;|hoods which they are perpetually imbibing, that they have a natural Reli&s;h for Error, and have quite lo&s;t the Ta&s;te of Truth in political Mat|ters. I &s;hall therefore di&s;mi&s;s this Head with a Saying of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. This Mo|narch, when he was at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> us'd to amu&s;e him&s;elf with the Conver&s;ation of the famous <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> who was full of Stories relating to the Antiquity, Learning, and Manners of the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI>; and at the &s;ame time a Free-thinker in Points of Religion. The King upon hearing him repeat &s;ome incredible Accounts of the&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="92">
Ea&s;tern People, turning to tho&s;e who were a|bout: him, <HI>This Learned Divine,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is a very &s;trange Man: He believes every thing but the Bible.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus far con&s;idered the political Faith of the Party as it regards Matters of Fact, let us in the next Place take a View of it with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Doctrines which it embraces, and which are the Fundamental Points whereby they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e, whom they u&s;ed to repre&s;ent as Enemies to the Con&s;tituti|on in Church and State. How far their great Articles of political Faith, with re&s;pect to our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil Government, are con|&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and agreeable to Rea|&s;on and Truth, may be &s;een in the following Paradoxes, which are the E&s;&s;entials of a <HI>Tory</HI>'s Creed, with relation to political Matters. Un|der the Name of <HI>Tories,</HI> I do not here compre|hend Multitudes of well-de&s;igning Men, who were formerly included under that Denomina|tion, but are now in the Intere&s;t of His Maje&s;ty and the pre&s;ent Government.

<P>IT is with great Plea&s;ure that I &s;ee a Race of Female-Patriots &s;pringing up in this I&s;land. The faire&s;t among the Daughters of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> no longer confine their Cares to a Dome|&s;tick Life, but are grown anxious for the Wel|fare of their Countrey, and &s;hew them&s;elves good State&s;women as well as good Hou&s;ewives.</P>
<P>Our She-Confederates keep pace with us in qua&s;hing that Rebellion which had begun to &s;pread it&s;elf among Part of the fair Sex. If the Men who are true to their King and Countrey have taken <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Perth,</HI> the Ladies have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of the Opera and the Play-Hou&s;e with as little Oppo&s;ition or Blood&s;hed. The Non-re&s;i&s;ting Women, like their Brothers in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> think no Po&s;t tenable again&s;t an Army that makes &s;o fine an Appearance; and dare not look them in the Face, when they are drawn up in Battel-array.</P>
<P>As an In&s;tance of the Chearfulne&s;s in our fair Fellow-Subjects to oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of the Pretender, I did but &s;ugge&s;t in one of my for|mer Papers, <HI>That the Fan might be made u&s;e of with good Succe&s;s again&s;t Popery, by exhibiting the Corruptions of the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>in various Fi|gures</HI>; when immediately they took the Hint,
<PB N="87" REF="96">
and have &s;ince had frequent Con&s;ultations upon &s;everal Ways and Methods <HI>to make the Fan u&s;e|ful.</HI> They have unanimou&s;ly agreed upon the following Re&s;olutions, which are indeed very &s;uitable to Ladies who are at the &s;ame Time the mo&s;t Beautiful and the mo&s;t Loyal of their Sex. To hide their Faces behind the Fan, when they ob&s;erve a <HI>Tory</HI> gazing upon 'em. Never to peep through it, but in Order to pick out Men, who&s;e Principles make them worth the Conque&s;t. To return no other An&s;wer to a <HI>Tory</HI>'s Addre&s;&s;es, than by counting the Sticks of it all the while he is talking to them. To avoid dropping it in the Neighbourhood of a Male|content, that he may not have an Opportunity of taking it up. To &s;hew their Disbelief of any <HI>Jacobite</HI> Story by a Flirt of it. To fall a Fan|ning them&s;elves, when a Tory comes into one of their A&s;&s;emblies, as being di&s;order'd at the Sight of him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the U&s;es by which every Fan may in the Hands of a fine Woman become &s;ervice|able to the Publick. But they have at pre&s;ent under Con&s;ideration, certain Fans of a Prote|&s;tant Make, that they may have a more exten|&s;ive Influence, and rai&s;e an Abhorrence of Po|pery in a whole Crowd of Beholders: For they intend to let the World &s;ee what Party they are of, by Figures and De&s;igns upon the&s;e Fans; as the Knights Errant u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by Devices on their Shields.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Sketches of Pictures which have been already pre&s;ented to the Ladies for their Approbation, and out of which &s;everal have made their Choice. A pretty young Lady will very &s;oon appear with a Fan, which has on it a Nunnery of lively black-Eyed Ve&s;tals, who
<PB N="88" REF="97">
are endeavouring to creep out at the Grates. Another has a Fan mounted with a fine Paper, on which is repre&s;ented a Groupe of People upon their Knees very devoutly wor&s;hipping an old Ten-Penny Nail. A certain Lady of great Learning has cho&s;en for her Device the Coun|cil of <HI>Trent</HI>; and another, who has a good Sa|tyrical Turn, has filled her Fan with the Figure of a huge tawdry Woman, repre&s;enting the Whore of <HI>Babylon</HI>; which &s;he is re&s;olved to &s;pread full in the Face of any Si&s;ter-Di&s;putant, who&s;e Arguments have a Tendency to Popery. The following De&s;igns are already executed on &s;everal Mountings. The Ceremony of the Holy Pontiff opening the Mouth of a Cardinal in a full Con&s;i&s;tory. An old Gentleman with a Triple Crown upon his Head, and big with Child, being the Portrait of Pope <HI>Joan.</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Bonner</HI> purcha&s;ing great Quantities of Faggots and Bru&s;h-Wood, for the Conver&s;ion of Here|ticks. A Figure reaching at a Sceptre with one Hand, and holding a Chaplet of Beads in the other: With a di&s;tant View of <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>When our Ladies make their Zeal thus vi|&s;ible upon their Fans, and, every Time they open them, di&s;play an Error of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> it cannot but have a good Effect, by &s;hewing the Enemies of our pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h|ment the Folly of what they are contending for. At lea&s;t, every One mu&s;t allow that Fans are much more innocent Engines for propaga|ting the Prote&s;tant Religion, than Racks, Wheels, Gibbets, and the like Machines, which are made U&s;e of for the Advancement of the Roman-Ca|tholick. Be&s;ides, as every Lady will of cour&s;e &s;tudy her Fan, &s;he will be a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Controver&s;y at lea&s;t in one Point of Popery;
<PB N="89" REF="98">
and as her Curio&s;ity will put her upon the Pe|ru&s;al of every other Fan that is fa&s;hionable, I doubt not but in a very little Time there will &s;carce be a Woman of Quality in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who would not be an Over-Match for an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>The beautiful Part of this I&s;land, whom I am proud to number among&s;t the mo&s;t candid of my Readers, will likewi&s;e do well to reflect, that our Di&s;pute at pre&s;ent concerns our Civil as well as Religious Rights. I &s;hall therefore only offer it to their Thoughts as a Point that highly de&s;erves their Con&s;ideration, Whether the Fan may not al&s;o be made U&s;e of with Re|gard to our Political Con&s;titution. As a Free-Holder, I would not have them confine their Cares for us as we are Prote&s;tants, but at the &s;ame Time have an Eye to our Happine&s;s as we are <HI>Britons.</HI> In this Ca&s;e they wou'd give a new Turn to the Minds of their Countreymen, if they wou'd exhibit on their Fans the &s;everal Grievances of a Tyrannical Government. Why might not an Audience of <HI>Muley I&s;hmael,</HI> or a <HI>Turk</HI> dropping his Handkerchief in his Seraglio, be proper Subjects to expre&s;s their Abhorrence both of De&s;potick Power, and of Male Tyran|ny? Or if they have a Fancy for Burle&s;que, what wou'd they think of a <HI>French</HI> Cobler cut|ting Shoes for &s;everal of his Fellow-Subjects out of an old Apple-Tree? On the contrary, a fine Woman, who wou'd maintain the Dignity of her Sex, might bear a String of Gally-Slaves, dragging their Chains the whole Breadth of her Fan; and at the &s;ame Time, to celebrate her own Triumphs, might order every Slave to be drawn with the Face of one of her Admi|rers.</P>

<P>IT being the De&s;ign of the&s;e Papers to recon|cile Men to their own Happine&s;s, by remo|ving
<PB N="91" REF="100">
tho&s;e wrong Notions and Prejudices which hinder them from &s;eeing the Advantage of them|&s;elves and their Po&s;terity in the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, I cannot but take Notice of every Thing that by the Artifice of our Enemies is made a Matter of Complaint.</P>
<P>Of this Nature is the Su&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Ha|beas Corpus</HI> Act, by which His Maje&s;ty has been enabled in the&s;e Times of Danger, to &s;eize and detain the Per&s;ons of &s;uch, who He had Rea&s;on to believe were Con&s;piring again&s;t His Per&s;on and Government. The Expediency and Rea&s;o|nablene&s;s of &s;uch a temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion in the pre&s;ent Juncture may appear to every con&s;ide|rate Man, who will turn his Thoughts impar|tially on this Subject.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en in Points of this Nature to draw my Arguments from the fir&s;t Principles of Go|vernment, which, as they are of no Party, but a&s;&s;ented to by every rea&s;onable Man, carry the greater Weight with them, and are accommo|dated to the Notions of all my Readers. Eve|ry One knows, who has con&s;ider'd the Nature of Government, that there mu&s;t be in each par|ticular Form of it an Ab&s;olute and Unlimited Power; and that This Power is lodg'd in the Hands of tho&s;e, who have the Making of its Laws, whether by the Nature of the Con&s;titu|tion it be in One or more Per&s;ons, in a &s;ingle Order of Men, or in a mixt Body of different Ranks and Degrees. It is an Ab&s;urdity to i|magine that tho&s;e, who have the Authority of Making Laws, cannot &s;u&s;pend any particular Law, when they think it expedient for the Pub|lick. Without &s;uch a Power all Govern|ment would be defective, and not arm'd with a &s;ufficient Force for its own Security. As
<PB N="92" REF="101">
Self-Pre&s;ervation by all hone&s;t Methods is the fir&s;t Duty of every Community, as well as of every private Per&s;on, &s;o the publick Safety is the general View of all Laws. When therefore any Law does not conduce to this great End, but on the contrary in &s;ome extraordinary and unnatural Junctures, the very Ob&s;ervation of it would endanger the Community, that Law ought to be laid a&s;leep for &s;uch a Time, by the proper Authority. Thus the very Intention of our <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, namely, the Pre&s;ervation of the Liberties of the Subject, ab&s;olutely re|quires that Act to be now &s;u&s;pended, &s;ince the Confinement of dangerous and &s;u&s;pected Per|&s;ons, who might &s;trengthen this Rebellion, and &s;pread a Civil War through all Parts of this Kingdom, &s;ecures to us our Civil Rights, and every Thing that can be valuable to a Free People.</P>
<P>As every Government mu&s;t in its Nature be arm'd with &s;uch an Authority, we may ob&s;erve that tho&s;e Governments which have been the mo&s;t famous for publick Spirit, and the mo&s;t jealous of their Liberty, have never failed to exert it upon proper Occa&s;ions. There cannot be a greater In&s;tance of this, than in the old Common wealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> who flatter'd them|&s;elves with an Opinion that their Government had in it a due Temper of the Regal, Noble, and Popular Power, repre&s;ented by the Con&s;uls, the Senators, and the Tribunes. The Regal Part was however in &s;everal Points notoriou&s;ly defective, and particularly becau&s;e the Con|&s;uls had not a Negative in the pa&s;&s;ing of a Law, as the other two Branches had. Neverthele&s;s in this Government, when the Republick was threaten'd with any great and imminent Dan|ger,
<PB N="93" REF="102">
they thought it for the common Safety to appoint a Temporary Dictator, inve&s;ted with the whole Power of the three Branches; who, when the Danger was over, retired again into the Community, and left the Government in its natural Situation. But what is more to our Ca&s;e, the Con&s;ular Power it&s;elf, tho' infinitely &s;hort of the Regal Power in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> was intru&s;ted with the whole Authority which the Legi&s;lature has put into the Hands of His Maje|&s;ty. We have an Eminent In&s;tance of this in the Motto of my Paper, which I &s;hall Tran&s;late for the Benefit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, after having adverti&s;ed him, that the Power there given to the Con&s;ul, was in the Time of a Con&s;piracy. <HI>The Senate therefore made a Decree, as u&s;ual, when they have Matters before them of &s;o Horrid a Na|ture, That the Con&s;uls &s;hould take Care the Com|mon-Wealth did not &s;uffer any Prejudice. By Vir|tue of this very great Power which the Senate al|lows to the Magi&s;trate, according to the Antient Cu&s;toms of</HI> Rome<HI>, He may rai&s;e an Army, wage War, make U&s;e of all kinds of Methods to re&s;train the A&s;&s;ociates and Citizens of</HI> Rome<HI>, and exerci&s;e the Supreme Authority both at Home and Abroad in Matters Civil and Military; whereas otherwi&s;e the Con&s;ul is not inve&s;ted with any of the&s;e Powers without the expre&s;s Command of the People.</HI></P>
<P>There now only remains to &s;hew, that His Maje&s;ty is legally po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Power; and that the Nece&s;&s;ity of the pre&s;ent Affairs requires He &s;hould be &s;o. He is entru&s;ted with it by the Legi&s;lature of the Nation; and in the very Notion of a Legi&s;lature is implied a Power to change, repeal, and &s;u&s;pend what Laws are in Being, as well as to make what new Laws they &s;hall think fit for the Good of the
<PB N="94" REF="103">
People. This is &s;o uncontroverted a Maxim, that I believe never any Body attempted to re|fute it. Our Legi&s;lature have however had that ju&s;t Regard for their Fellow-Subjects, as not to entertain a Thought of abrogating this Law, but only to hinder it from operating at a Time when it would endanger the Con&s;titution. The King is empowered to act but for a few Months by Virtue of this Su&s;pen&s;ion; and by that Means differs from a King of <HI>France,</HI> or any other Ty|rannical Prince, who in Times of Peace and Tranquillity, and upon what Occa&s;ion he plea|&s;es, &s;ends any of his Subjects out of the Know|ledge of their Friends into &s;uch Ca&s;tles, Dun|geons, or Impri&s;onments as he thinks fit. Nor did the Legi&s;lature do any Thing in this that was unprecedented. The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act was made but about five and thirty Years ago, and &s;ince that Time has been &s;u&s;pended four Times before his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne: Twice under the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; once under the Reign of King <HI>William</HI>; and once under the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity of this Law at this Time aro&s;e from the Pro&s;pect of an Inva&s;ion, which has &s;ince broke out into an actual Rebellion; and from Informations of &s;ecret and dangerous Pra|ctices among Men of con&s;iderable Figure, who could not have been prevented from doing Mi&s;|chief to their Countrey but by &s;uch a Su&s;pen&s;ion of this Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot however but ob&s;erve, that notwith|&s;tanding the Lawfulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Su&s;pen&s;ion, had not the Rebellion broke out after the pa&s;&s;ing of this Act of Parliament, I do not know how tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="104">
in&s;trumental in procuring it, could have e&s;cap'd that popular Odium, which their malicious and artful Enemies have now in vain endeavoured to &s;tir up again&s;t them. Had it been po&s;&s;ible for the Vigilance and Endeavours of a Mini&s;try to have hindered even the Attempt of an Inva&s;ion, their very Endeavours might have proved pre|judicial to them. Their prudent and re&s;olute Precautions would have turned to their Di&s;ad|vantage, had they not been ju&s;tified by tho&s;e Events, which they did all that was in their Power to obviate. This naturally brings to Mind the Reflection of <HI>Tully</HI> in the like Circum|&s;tances, <HI>That</HI> amid&s;t the Divi&s;ions of <HI>Rome, a Man was in an unhappy Condition who had a Soare in the Admini&s;tration, nay even in the Pre|&s;ervation of the Common-Wealth.</HI> O conditionem mi&s;eram non modo admini&s;trandae, verum eti|am con&s;ervandae Reipublicae!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, every unprejudiced Man will con&s;i|der how mildly and equitably this Power has been u&s;ed. The Per&s;ons confined have been treated with all po&s;&s;ible Humanity, and abridg|ed of nothing but the Liberty of hurting their Countrey, and very probably of ruining both them&s;elves and their Families. And as to the Numbers of tho&s;e who are under this &s;hort Re|&s;traint, it is very ob&s;ervable, that People do not &s;eem &s;o much &s;urpized at the Confinement of &s;ome, as at the Liberty of many Others. But we may from hence conclude, what every <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI> mu&s;t ob&s;erve with great Plea&s;ure; that His Maje&s;ty does not in this great Point regu|late Him&s;elf by any private Jealou&s;ies or Su&s;|picions, but by tho&s;e Evidences and Informati|ons which he has received.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="105">
We have already found the good Con&s;equen|ces of this Su&s;pen&s;ion, in that it has hindered the Rebellion from gathering the Strength it would otherwi&s;e have gained; not to mention tho&s;e Numbers it has kept from engaging in &s;o de&s;perate an Enterprize, with the many Lives it has pre&s;erved, and the De&s;olations it has prevented.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and many other Rea&s;ons the Re|pre&s;entatives of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in Parliament could never have an&s;wered it to the People they repre&s;ent, who have found &s;uch great Be|nefits from the Su&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, and without it mu&s;t have felt &s;uch fatal Con&s;equences, had they not in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch great Nece&s;&s;ity made U&s;e of this cu&s;tomary, legal, and rea&s;onable Method for Securing His Maje&s;ty on the Throne, and their Countrey from Mi&s;ery or Ruine.</P>

<P>WE are told, that in <HI>Turkey,</HI> when any Man is the Author of Notorious Fal&s;hoods, it is u&s;ual to blacken the whole Front of his Hou&s;e: Nay we have &s;ometimes heard, that an Emba&s;|&s;ador, who&s;e <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s it is</HI> (if I may quote his Character in Sir <HI>Henry Wotton</HI>'s Words) <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for the Good of his Countrey,</HI> has &s;ometimes had this Mark &s;et upon his Hou&s;e; when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="97" REF="106">
been detected in any Piece of feign'd Intelli|gence, that has prejudiced the Government, and mi&s;led the Minds of the People. One cou'd almo&s;t wi&s;h that the Habitations of &s;uch of our own Countreymen as deal in Forge|ties detrimental to the Publick, were di&s;tingui|&s;hed in the &s;ame Manner; that their Fellow-Subjects might be cautioned not to be too ea&s;y in giving Credit to them. Were &s;uch a Me|thod put in Practice, this Metropolis wou'd be &s;trangely checquer'd; &s;ome entire Pari&s;hes wou'd be in Mourning, and &s;everal Streets darkned from one End to the other.</P>
<P>But I have given my Thoughts in two pre|ceding Papers, both on the Inventors and the Believers of the&s;e publick Fal&s;hoods and Ca|lumnies, and &s;hall here &s;peak of that Contempt with which they are and ought to be received by tho&s;e in high Stations, at whom they are le|vell'd. Any Per&s;on indeed, who is zealous for promoting the Intere&s;t of his Countrey, mu&s;t conquer all that Tenderne&s;s and Delicacy which may make him afraid of being &s;poken ill of; or his Endeavours will often produce no le&s;s Unea&s;ine&s;s to him&s;elf, than Benefit to the Publick. Among a People who indulge them|&s;elves in the utmo&s;t Freedoms of Thought and Speech, a Man mu&s;t either be in&s;ignificant, or able to bear an unde&s;erved Reproach. A true Patriot may comfort him&s;elf under the Attacks of Fal&s;hood and Obloquy, from &s;everal Motives and Reflections.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place he &s;hou'd con&s;ider, that the chief of his Antagoni&s;ts are generally acted by Spirit of Envy; which wou'd not ri&s;e again&s;t him, if it were not provoked by his De&s;ert. A State&s;man, who is po&s;&s;e&s;t of real Merit, &s;hou'd
<PB N="98" REF="107">
look upon his political Cen&s;urers with the &s;ame Neglect, that a good Writer regards his Cri|ticks; who are generally a Race of Men that are not able to di&s;cover the Beauties of a Work they examine, and deny that Approbation to O|thers, which they never met with them&s;elves. Patriots therefore &s;hou'd rather rejoyce in the Succe&s;s of their hone&s;t De&s;igns, than be mor|tified by tho&s;e who mi&s;repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>They &s;hou'd likewi&s;e con&s;ider, that not only Envy, but Vanity has a Share in the Detrac|tion of their Adver&s;aries. Such A&s;per&s;ions therefore do them Honour at the &s;ame Time that they are intended to le&s;&s;en their Reputation. They &s;hou'd reflect, That tho&s;e who endeavour to &s;tir up the Multitude again&s;t them, do it to be thought con&s;iderable; and not a little applaud them&s;elves in a Talent that can rai&s;e Clamours out of nothing, and throw a Ferment among the People, by Murmurs or Complaints, which they know in their own Hearts are altogether groundle&s;s. There is a plea&s;ant In&s;tance of this Nature recorded at length in the Fir&s;t Book of the Annals of <HI>Tacitus.</HI> When a great Part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions were in a Di&s;po&s;ition to mutiny, an Impudent Varlet, who was a private Centi|nel, being mounted upon the Shoulders of his Fellow-Soldiers, and re&s;olved to try the Power of his Eloquence, addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Army, in all the Po&s;tures of an Orator, after the follow|ing Manner: <HI>You have given Liberty to the&s;e mi&s;e|rable Men</HI>: &s;aid he, (pointing to &s;ome Criminals whom they had re&s;cued) <HI>but which of you can re&s;tore Life to my Brother</HI>? <HI>Who can give me back my Brother</HI>? <HI>He was murder'd no longer ago than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Night, by the Hands of tho&s;e Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ians, who are ea|tertain'd by the General to butcher the poor S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">|ery.</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="108">
<HI>Tell me,</HI> Blae&s;us, (for that was the Name of the General, who was then &s;itting on the Tribunal) <HI>tell me, Where ha&s;t thou ca&s;t his dead Body</HI>? <HI>An Enemy does not grudge the Rites of Bu|rial. When I have tired my &s;elf with ki&s;&s;ing his cold Corps, and weeping over it, order me to be &s;lain upon it. All I ask of my Fellow-Soldiers, &s;ince we both dye in their Cau&s;e, is that they wou'd lay me in the &s;ame Grave with my Brother.</HI> The whole Army was in an Uproar at this moving Speech, and re&s;olved to do the Speaker Ju&s;tice, when, upon Enquiry, they found that he never had a Brother in his Life; and that he had &s;tir|red up the Sedition only to &s;hew his Parts.</P>
<P>Publick Mini&s;ters would likewi&s;e do well to con&s;ider, that the principal Authors of &s;uch Re|proaches as are ca&s;t upon them, are tho&s;e who have a Mind to get their Places: And as for a Cen&s;ure ari&s;ing from this Motive, it is in their Power to e&s;cape it when they plea&s;e, and turn it upon their Competitors. Malecontents of an inferiour Character are acted by the &s;ame Principle; for &s;o long as there are Employ|ments of all Sizes, there will be Murmurers of all Degrees. I have heard of a Countrey-Gentleman, who made a very long and me|lancholy Complaint to the late Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham,</HI> when he was in great Power at Court, of &s;everal publick Grievances. The Duke, after having given him a very patient Hearing, <HI>My dear Friend,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>this is but too true; but I have thought of an Expedient which will &s;et all Things right, and that very &s;oon.</HI> His Countrey Friend asked him, what it was. <HI>You mu&s;t know,</HI> &s;ays the Duke, <HI>there's a Place of five Hundred Pounds a Year fallen this very Morning, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to put you in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</HI> The Gentle|man
<PB N="100" REF="109">
thanked his Grace, went away &s;atisfied, and thought the Nation the happie&s;t under Hea|ven, during that whole Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>But farther, every Man in a publick Station ought to con&s;ider, that when there are two dif|ferent Parties in a Nation, they will &s;ee Things in different Lights. An Action however con|ducive to the Good of their Countrey, will be repre&s;ented by the Artful and appear to the Ig|norant as prejudicial to it. Since I have here, according to the u&s;ual Liberty of E&s;&s;ay-Wri|ters, rambled into &s;everal Stories, I &s;hall fetch one to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e out of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Hi&s;tory. We there read of a virtuous young Emperor, who was very much afflicted to find his Actions mi&s;con&s;trued and defamed by a Par|ty among his Subjects that favour'd another In|tere&s;t. As he was one Day &s;itting among the Mini&s;ters of his <HI>Divan,</HI> and amu&s;ing him&s;elf after the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Manner, with the Solution of difficult Problems and Aenigma's, he pro|po&s;ed to them in his Turn, the following one. <HI>What is the Tree that bears three Hundred and &s;ixty five Leaves, which are all Black on the one Side, and White on the other</HI>? His Grand Vi&s;ier imme|diately replied, it was the Year which con&s;i&s;ted of three Hundred and &s;ixty five Days and Nights: <HI>But Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>permit me at the &s;ame Time to take Notice, that the&s;e Leaves repre&s;ent your Ac|tions, which carry different Faces to your Friends and Enemies, and will always appear black to tho&s;e who are re&s;olv'd only to look upon the wrong Side of 'em.</HI></P>
<P>A virtuous Man therefore who lays out his Endeavours for the Good of his Countrey, &s;hould never be troubled at the Reports which are made of him, &s;o long as he is con&s;cious of
<PB N="101" REF="110">
his own Integrity. He &s;hould rather be plea&s;ed, to find People de&s;canting upon his Actions, be|cau&s;e when they are thoroughly canva&s;&s;ed and examined, they are &s;ure in the End to turn to his Honour and Advantage. The rea&s;onable and unprejudiced Part of Mankind will be of his Side, and rejoyce to &s;ee their common In|tere&s;t lodged in &s;uch hone&s;t Hands. A &s;trict Examination of a great Man's Character, is like the Trial of a &s;u&s;pected Cha&s;tity, which was made among the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Waters of Jealou|&s;y. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;ures us that the Criminal bur&s;t up|on the drinking of them; but if &s;he was accu&s;ed wrongfully, the <HI>Rabbins</HI> tell us, they heighten'd her Charms, and made her much more amiable than before: So that they de&s;troyed the Guilty, but beautified the Innocent.</P>

I &s;hall not therefore think it improper to take Notice from Time to Time of any particular Act of Power, exerted by tho&s;e among whom the Pre|tender
<PB N="102" REF="111">
to His Maje&s;ty's Crown has been edu|cated; which wou'd prove fatal to this Nation, &s;hou'd it be Conquer'd and Govern'd by a Per|&s;on, who, in all Probability, wou'd put in Prac|tice the Politicks in which he has been &s;o long in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>There has been nothing more ob&s;ervable in the Reign of His pre&s;ent <HI>Gallick</HI> Maje&s;ty, than the Method he has taken for &s;upplying his Ex|chequer with a nece&s;&s;ary Sum of Money. The Ways and Means for rai&s;ing it has been an E|dict, or a Command in Writing &s;igned by him|&s;elf, to encrea&s;e the Value of <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> from Fourteen to Sixteen <HI>Livres,</HI> by Virtue of a new Stamp which &s;hall be &s;truck upon them. As this Method will bring all the Gold of the Kingdom into his Hands, it is provided by the &s;ame Edict that they &s;hall be payed out a|gain to the People at Twenty <HI>Livres</HI> each; &s;o that Four <HI>Livres</HI> in the Score by this Means ac|crue to His Maje&s;ty out of all the Money in the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This Method of rai&s;ing Money is con&s;i&s;tent with that Form of Government, and with the repeated Practice of their late <HI>Grand Monarque</HI>; &s;o that I &s;hall not here con&s;ider the many evil Con&s;equences which it mu&s;t have upon their Trade, their Exchange, and publick Credit: I &s;hall only take Notice of the whim&s;ical Cir|cum&s;tances a People mu&s;t lie under, who can be thus made poor or rich by an Edict, which can throw an Alloy into a <HI>Louis d' Or,</HI> and de|ba&s;e it into half its former Value, or, if His Maje&s;ty plea&s;es, rai&s;e the Price of it, not by the Acce&s;&s;ion of Metal, but of a Mark. By the pre&s;ent Edict many a Man in <HI>France</HI> will &s;well into a Plumb, who fell &s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds

This conveys a Kind of <HI>Fairy</HI> Trea&s;ure into their Che&s;ts, even whil&s;t they are under Lock and Key; and is a Secret of Multiplication without Addition. It is natural enough however for the Vanity of the <HI>French</HI> Nation to grow in&s;olent upon this imaginary Wealth, not con&s;idering that their Neighbours think them no more Rich by Virtue of an Edict to make Fourteen Twen|ty, than they wou'd think 'em more formidable &s;hould there be another Edict to make every Man in the Kingdom Seven Foot high.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual for his late Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty to &s;ink the Value of their <HI>Louis d' Ors</HI> about the Time he was to receive the Taxes of his good People, and to rai&s;e them when he had got them &s;afe into his Coffers. And there is no Que&s;tion but the pre&s;ent Government in that Kingdom, will &s;o far ob&s;erve this Kind of Con|duct, as to reduce the Twenty <HI>Livres</HI> to their old Number of Fourteen, when they have paid them out of their Hands; which will immedi|ately &s;ink the pre&s;ent Timpany of Wealth, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the natural Poverty of the <HI>Gallick</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>One cannot but pity the melancholy Condi|tion of a Mi&s;er in this Countrey, who is perpe|tually telling his <HI>Livres,</HI> without being able to know how Rich he is. He is as ridiculou&s;ly puzzled and perplexed as a Man that counts the Stones on <HI>Salisbury-Plain,</HI> which can never be &s;ettled to any certain Number, but are more or fewer every Time he reckons them.</P>
<P>I have heard of a young <HI>French</HI> Lady, a Sub|ject of <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, who was contrac|ted to a Marquis upon the Foot of a Five Thou|&s;and Pound Fortune, which &s;he had by her in
<PB N="104" REF="113">
Specie; but one of the&s;e unlucky Edicts coming out a Week before the intended Marriage, &s;he lo&s;t a Thou&s;and Pound, and her Bridegroom into the Bargain.</P>
<P>The Uncertainty of Riches is a Subject much di&s;cour&s;ed of in all Countries, but may be in&s;i&s;t|ed on more emphatically in <HI>France</HI> than any o|ther. A Man is here under &s;uch a Kind of Si|tuation, as One who is managed by a Jugler. He fancies he has &s;o many Pieces of Money in his Hand; but let him gra&s;p them never &s;o care|fully, upon a Word or two of the Arti&s;t they encrea&s;e or dwindle to what Number the Doc|tor is plea&s;ed to name.</P>
<P>This Method of lowering or advancing Mo|ney, we, who have the Happine&s;s to be in ano|ther Form of Government, &s;hould look upon as an unwarrantable Kind of Clipping and Coin|ing. However, as it is an Expedient that is of|ten practi&s;ed, and may be ju&s;tify'd in that Con|&s;titution which has been &s;o thoroughly &s;tudied by the Pretender to His Maje&s;ty's Crown, I do not &s;ee what &s;hould have hinder'd him from making U&s;e of &s;o expeditious a Method for rai&s;ing a Supply, if he had &s;ucceeded in his late Attempt to dethrone His Maje&s;ty, and &s;ubvert our Con&s;ti|tution. I &s;hall leave it to the Con&s;ideration of the Reader, if in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the following E|dict, or &s;omething very like it, might not have been expected.</P>
<Q>'WHereas the&s;e our Kingdoms have long groaned under an expen&s;ive and con|&s;uming Land-War, which has very much ex|hau&s;ted the Trea&s;ure of the Nation, we, be|ing willing to increa&s;e the Wealth of our Peo|ple, and not thinking it advi&s;able for this Pur|po&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="114">
to make U&s;e of the tedious Methods of Merchandi&s;e and Commerce, which have been always promoted by a Faction among the wor&s;t of our Subjects, and were &s;o wi&s;e|ly di&s;countenanc'd by the be&s;t of them in the late Reign, do hereby Enact by our &s;ole Will and Plea&s;ure, that every Shilling in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &s;hall pa&s;s in all Payments for the Sum of fourteen Pence, till the fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> next, and that every other Piece of Money &s;hall ri&s;e and pa&s;s in current Payment in the &s;ame Proportion. The Advantage which will accrue to the&s;e Nations by this our Royal Do|native, will vi&s;ibly appear to all Men of &s;ound Principles, who are &s;o ju&s;tly famous for their Antipathy to Strangers, and would not &s;ee the Landed Intere&s;t of their Countrey wea|ken'd by the Importations of Foreign Gold and Silver. But &s;ince by Rea&s;on of the great Debts which we have contracted Abroad, du|ring our fifteen Years Reign, as well as of our pre&s;ent Exigencies, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to fill our Exchequer by the mo&s;t prudent and expeditious Methods, we do al&s;o hereby order every one of our Subjects to bring in the&s;e his fourteen-penny Pieces, and all the other current Ca&s;h of this Kingdom, by what new Titles &s;oever dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed, to the Ma&s;ter of our Mint, who, after having &s;et a Mark upon them &s;hall deliver out to them, on or after the fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> afore|&s;aid, their re&s;pective Sums, taking only Four Pence for our &s;elf for &s;uch his Mark on e|very Fourteen Penny Piece, which from hence|forth &s;hall pa&s;s in Payment for Eighteen Pence, and &s;o in Proportion for the re&s;t.

<P>IT has been u&s;ual the&s;e many Years for Wri|ters, who have approved the Scheme of Go|vernment which has taken Place, to explain to the People the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e Prin|ciples which have prevailed, and to ju&s;tify the Conduct of tho&s;e, who act in Conformity to &s;uch Principles. It therefore happens well for the Party which is undermo&s;t, when a Work of this Nature falls into the Hands of tho&s;e who content them&s;elves to attack their Prin|ciples, without expo&s;ing their Per&s;ons, or &s;in|gling out any particular Objects for Satyr and Ridicule. This Manner of Proceeding is no incon&s;iderable Piece of Merit in Writers, who
<PB N="107" REF="116">
are often more influenc'd by a De&s;ire of Fame, than a Regard to the publick Good; and who, by this Means, lo&s;e many fair Opportunities of &s;hewing their own Wit, or of gratifying the Ill-Nature of their Readers.</P>
<P>When a Man thinks a Party engaged in &s;uch Mea&s;ures as tend to the Ruine of his Coun|trey, it is certainly a very laudable and virtu|ous Action in him to make War after this Man|ner upon the whole Body. But as &s;everal Ca|&s;ui&s;ts are of Opinion, that in a Battel you &s;hou'd di&s;charge upon the Gro&s;s of the Enemy, with|out levelling your Piece at any particular Per|&s;on; &s;o in this Kind of Combat al&s;o, I cannot think it fair to aim at any one Man, and make his Character the Mark of your Ho&s;tilities. There is now to be &s;een in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Milan,</HI> a Can|non-Bullet, in&s;cribed, <HI>This to the Mare&s;chal de Crequi,</HI> which was the very Ball that &s;hot him. An Author who points his Satyr at a Great Man, is to be looked upon in the &s;ame View with the Engineer who &s;ignalized him&s;elf by this unge|nerous Practice.</P>
<P>But as the Spirit of the <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> &s;hews it&s;elf, upon every Occa&s;ion, to be very widely different from one another; &s;o is it par|ticularly vi&s;ible in the Writings of this Kind, which have been publi&s;hed by each Party. The latter may, indeed, a&s;&s;ign one Rea&s;on to ju&s;tify them&s;elves in this Practice; that, having nothing of any Manner of Weight to offer again&s;t the Principles of their Antagoni&s;ts, if they &s;peak at all, it mu&s;t be again&s;t their Per&s;ons. When they cannot refute an Adver&s;ary, the &s;horte&s;t Way is to libel him; and to endeavour at the making his Per&s;on odious, when they cannot repre&s;ent his Notions as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="117">
The <HI>Examiner</HI> was a Paper, in the la&s;t Reign, which was the Favourite-Work of the Party. It was u&s;her'd into the World by a Letter from a Secretary of State, &s;etting forth the great Ge|nius of the Author, the U&s;efulne&s;s of his De|&s;ign, and the mighty Con&s;equences that were to be expected from it. It is &s;aid to have been written by tho&s;e among 'em whom they looked upon as their mo&s;t celebrated Wits and Politi|cians, and was di&s;per&s;ed into all Quarters of the Nation with great Indu&s;try and Expence. Who would not have expected, that at lea&s;t the Rules of Decency and Candour would be ob|&s;erved in &s;uch a Performance? But in&s;tead of this, you &s;aw all the great Men, who had done eminent Services to their Countrey but a few Years before, draughted out one by one, and baited in their Turns. No Sanctity of Charac|ter, or Privilege of Sex, exempted Per&s;ons from this barbarous U&s;age. Several of our Prelates were the &s;tanding Marks of publick Raillery, and many Ladies of the fir&s;t Quality branded by Name for Matters of Fact, which as they were fal&s;e, were not heeded, and if they had been true, were innocent. The Dead them|&s;elves were not &s;pared. And here I cannot forbear taking Notice of a Kind of Wit which has lately grown into Fa&s;hion among the Ver|&s;ifiers, Epigrammati&s;ts, and other Authors, who think it &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their Zeal for what they call the High-Church, while they &s;port with the mo&s;t tremendous Parts of Revealed Religion. Every one has &s;een E|pigrams upon the decea&s;ed Fathers of our Church, where the whole Thought has turned upon Hell-Fire. Patriots, who ought to be remember'd with Honour by their Po&s;terity, have been in|troduced
<PB N="109" REF="118">
as Speakers in a State of Torments. There is &s;omething dreadful even in repeating the&s;e execrable Pieces of Wit, which no Man who really believes in another Life, can peru&s;e without Fear and Trembling. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee Readers who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, applauding &s;uch Diabolical Mirth, and &s;eeming to rejoyce in the Doom which is pronounced again&s;t their Enemies, by &s;uch abandoned Scriblers. A Wit of this Kind, may with great Truth be compared to the Fool in the <HI>Proverbs, who plays with Arrows, Fire-brands and Death, and &s;ays, am I not in Sport</HI>?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, in Ju&s;tice to the more &s;ober and con|&s;iderate of that Party, confe&s;s, that many of them were highly &s;candalized at that Per&s;onal Slander and Reflection which was flung out &s;o freely by the Libellers of the la&s;t Reign, as well as by tho&s;e profane Liberties which have been &s;ince continued. And as for tho&s;e who are ei|ther the Authors or Admirers of &s;uch Compo&s;i|tions, I would have them con&s;ider with them|&s;elves, whether the Name of a good Church|man can attone for the want of that Charity which is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of Chri&s;tianity. They would likewi&s;e do well to reflect, how, by the&s;e Methods, the Poi&s;on has run freely into the Minds of the Weak and Ignorant; height|ned their Rage again&s;t many of their Fellow-Subjects; and almo&s;t dive&s;ted them of the com|mon Sentiments of Humanity.</P>
<P>In the former Part of this Paper, I have hinted that the De&s;ign of it is to oppo&s;e the Principles of tho&s;e who are Enemies to the pre|&s;ent Government, and the main Body of that Party who e&s;pou&s;e tho&s;e Principles. But even in &s;uch general Attacks there are certain Mea|&s;ures
<PB N="110" REF="119">
to be kept, which may have a Tendency rather to gain, than to irritate tho&s;e who differ with you in their Sentiments. The <HI>Examiner</HI> would not allow &s;uch as were of a contrary Opinion to him, to be either Chri&s;tians or Fel|low-Subjects. With him they were all Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, or Apo&s;tates, and a &s;eparate Common-Wealth among them&s;elves, that ought either to be extirpated, or, when he was in a better Hu|mour, only to be bani&s;hed out of their Native Countrey. They were often put in mind of &s;ome approaching Execution, and therefore all of them advi&s;ed to prepare them&s;elves for it, as Men who had then nothing to take care of, but how to die decently. In &s;hort, the <HI>Exami|ner</HI> &s;eemed to make no di&s;tinction between Con|que&s;t and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Conduct of this Work has hitherto been regulated by different Views, and &s;hall continue to be &s;o; unle&s;s the Party it has to deal with, draw upon them&s;elves another kind of Treat|ment. For if they &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in pointing their Batteries again&s;t particular Per&s;ons, there are no Laws of War, that forbid the making of Repri&s;als. In the mean time, this Under|taking &s;hall be managed with that generous Spirit which was &s;o remarkable among the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> who did not &s;ubdue a Countrey in order to put the Inhabitants to Fire and Sword, but to incorporate them into their own Commu|nity, and make them happy in the &s;ame Govern|ment with them&s;elves.</P>

<P>IT is very unlucky for tho&s;e who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to rai&s;e Popular Murmurs and Di&s;contents again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's Government, that they find &s;o very few and &s;o very impro|per Occa&s;ions for them. To &s;hew how hard they are &s;et in this Particular, there are &s;everal, who for want of other Materials, are forced to repre&s;ent the Bill which has pa&s;&s;ed this Se&s;|&s;ion, for laying an additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound upon Land, as a kind of Grievance upon the Subject. If this be a Matter of Complaint, it ought in Ju&s;tice to fall upon tho&s;e who have made it nece&s;&s;ary. Had there been no Rebellion, there would have been no Increa&s;e of the Land-Tax; &s;o that in Pro|portion as a Man declares his Aver&s;ion to the one, he ought to te&s;tify his Abhorrence of the other. But it is very remarkable that tho&s;e, who would per&s;uade the People that they are aggrieved by this additional Burthen, are the very Per&s;ons who endeavour, in their ordinary Conver&s;ation, to extenuate the Hainou&s;ne&s;s of the Rebellion, and who expre&s;s the greate&s;t Ten|derne&s;s for the Per&s;ons of the Rebels. They &s;hew a particular Indulgence for that unnatural In&s;urrection which has drawn this Load upon as, and are angry at the Means which were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it. There needs no clearer
<PB N="112" REF="121">
Proof of the Spirit and Intention with which they act: I &s;hall therefore advi&s;e my Fellow-Free-Holders to con&s;ider the Character of any Per&s;on who would po&s;&s;e&s;s them with the Notion of a Hard&s;hip that is put upon the Countrey by this Tax. If he be one of known Affection to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, they may imagine there is &s;ome Rea&s;on for Complaint. But if on the contrary he be one, who has &s;hewn him&s;elf Indifferent as to the Succe&s;s of the pre&s;ent Rebellion, or is &s;u&s;pected as a private Abettor of it, they may take it for granted, his Complaint again&s;t the Land-Tax is either the Rage of a di&s;appointed Man, or the Artifice of one who would alienate their Affections from the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>The Expence which will ari&s;e to the Nation from this Rebellion, is already computed at near a Million. And it is a melancholy Con|&s;ideration for the Free-Holders of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> that the Trea&s;on of their Fellow-Subjects &s;hould bring upon them as great a Charge as the War with <HI>France.</HI> At the &s;ame Time every rea&s;onable Man among them will pay a Tax with at lea&s;t as great Chearfulne&s;s for &s;tifling a Civil War in its Birth, as for carrying on a War in a Foreign Countrey. Had not our fir&s;t Sup|plies been effectual for the cru&s;hing of our Do|me&s;tick Enemies, we &s;hould immediately have beheld the whole Kingdom a Scene of Slaugh|ter and De&s;olation: Whereas, if we had failed in our fir&s;t Attempts upon a di&s;tant Nation, we might have repaired the Lo&s;&s;es of one Cam|paign by the Advantages of another, and after &s;everal Victories gained over us, might &s;till have kept the Enemy from our Gates.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="122">
As it was thus ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a Sum that might enable the Government to put a &s;peedy Stop to the Rebellion, &s;o could there be no Method thought of for rai&s;ing &s;uch a Sum more proper, than this of laying an additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound upon Land.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place: This Tax has already been &s;o often tried, that we know the exact Produce of it, which in any new Project is always very doubtful and uncertain. As we are thus ac|quainted with the Produce of this Tax, we find this adequate to the Services for which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is de|&s;igned, and that the additional Tax is proporti|oned to the Supernumerary Expence, which falls upon the Kingdom this Year by the unna|tural Rebellion, as it has been above &s;tated.</P>
<P>In the next Place: No other Tax could have been thought of, upon which &s;o much Money would have been immediately advanced as was nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o critical a Juncture for pu&s;hing our Succe&s;&s;es again&s;t the Rebels, and preventing the Attempts of their Friends and Confederates both at Home and Abroad. No Body cares to make Loans upon a new and untried Project; whereas Men never fail to bring in their Mo|ney upon a Land-Tax, when the Praemium or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;t allowed them, is &s;uited to the Hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey run by &s;uch Loans to the Government. And here one cannot but bewail the Misfortune of our Countrey, when we con&s;ider, that the Hou&s;e of Commons had la&s;t Year reduced this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntere&s;t to Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> by which Means there was a con&s;iderable Saving to the Nation; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat this Year they have been forced to give Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> as well knowing the fatal Con&s;e|quences that might have en&s;ued, had there not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">een an Intere&s;t allowed, which would certainly
<PB N="114" REF="123">
encourage the Lender to venture, in &s;uch a Time of Danger, what was indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Exigences of the Publick.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; This is a Method for rai&s;ing a Sum of Money, that, with the ordinary Taxes, will in all Probability defray the whole Expence of the Year: So that there is no Burden laid upon our Po&s;terity, who have been &s;ufficiently loaded by other Means of rai&s;ing Money; nor any Deficiency to be hereafter made up by our &s;elves; which has been our Ca&s;e in &s;o ma|ny other Sub&s;idies.</P>
<P>To this we may add; That we have no Ex|ample of any other Tax, which in its Nature would &s;o particularly affect the Enemies to His Maje&s;ty's Government. Multitudes of <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Nonjurors</HI> will be obliged to furni&s;h a double Proportion out of their Revenues to|wards the clearing of that Expence, which by their open and &s;ecret Practices they have been In&s;trumental in bringing upon their Fellow-Subjects.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention one Con&s;ideration more; That no other Tax is &s;o likely to cea&s;e as this is, when there is no farther Occa&s;ion for it. This Tax is e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Hou&s;e of Commons, which, by Virtue of an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed a few Years ago, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t for the mo&s;t Part of Landed Men; &s;o that a great Share of the Weight of it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall upon the Members of their own Body. As this is an In|&s;tance of their Publick Spirit, &s;o we may be &s;ure they would not have exerted it, had there not been an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity: Nor can we doubt, that for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, when this Nece&s;&s;ity cea&s;es, they will take the fir&s;t Op|portunity of ea&s;ing them&s;elves in this Particular
<PB N="115" REF="124">
as well as tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent. It is a celebrated Notion of a Patriot, who &s;ignally di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for the Liberties of his Countrey, That a Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould ne|ver grant &s;uch Sub&s;idies as are ea&s;y to be rai&s;|ed, and give no Pain to the People, le&s;t the Nation &s;hould acquie&s;ce under a Burden they did not feel, and &s;ee it perpetuated without re|pining. Whether this Notion might not be too refined, I &s;hall not determine; but by what has been already &s;aid, I think we may promi&s;e our &s;elves, that this additional Tax of Two Shillings in the Pound will not be con|tinued another Year, becau&s;e we may hope the Rebellion will be entirely ended in This.</P>
<P>And here, I believe, it mu&s;t be obvious to every one's Reflection, that the Rebellion might not have concluded &s;o &s;oon, had not this Me|thod been made u&s;e of for that End. A fo|reign Potentate trembles at the Thought of en|tering into a War with &s;o wealthy an Enemy as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, when he finds the whole Landed Intere&s;t of the Kingdom engaged to oppo&s;e him with their united Force; and at all Times ready to employ again&s;t him &s;uch a Part of their Revenues, as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to baffle his De&s;igns upon their Countrey: E&s;pecially when none can imagine, that he expects any En|couragement from tho&s;e, who&s;e Fortunes are ei|ther lodged in the Funds, or employed in Trade.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom therefore of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons has by this Tax, not only enabled the King to &s;ubdue tho&s;e of his own Subjects who have been actually in Arms again&s;t him, but to divert any of his Neighbours from the Hopes of lending them a competent A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>IT is not ea&s;y for any one, who &s;aw the Mag|nificence of Ye&s;terday in the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to turn his Thoughts for &s;ome time after on any other Subject. It was a Solemni|ty every way &s;uited to the Birth-Day of a Prin|ce&s;s, who is the Delight of our Nation, and the Glory of her Sex. <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that when the Daughter of <HI>Jupiter</HI> pre&s;ented her&s;elf among a Crowd of Godde&s;&s;es, &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by her graceful Stature, and known by her &s;uperiour Beauty, notwith&s;tanding they were all beautiful. Such was the Appearance of the Prince&s;s of <HI>Wales</HI> among our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies; or (to u&s;e a more &s;olemn Phra&s;e) of <HI>the King's Daughter among her honourable Women.</HI> Her Royal Highne&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a Circle rai&s;es in the Beholder the Idea of a fine Picture, where (notwith&s;tanding the Diver&s;ity of plea|&s;ing Objects that fill up the Canvas) the prin|cipal Figure immediately takes the Eye, and fixes the Attention.</P>
<P>When this excellent Prince&s;s was yet in her Father's Court, &s;he was &s;o celebrated for the Beauty of her Per&s;on, and the Accompli&s;hments
<PB N="117" REF="126">
of her Mind, that there was no Prince in the Empire, who had room for &s;uch an Alliance, that was not ambitious of gaining her into his Family, either as a Daughter, or as a Con&s;ort. He, who is now the Chief of the Crowned Heads in <HI>Europe,</HI> and was then King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Heir to all the Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;ought her in Marriage. Could her Mind have been captivated with the Glories of this World, &s;he had them all laid before her; but &s;he generou&s;ly declined them, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw the Acceptance of them was incon&s;i&s;tent with what &s;he e&s;teems more than all the Glo|ries of this World, the Enjoyment of her Reli|gion. Providence however kept in Store a Re|ward for &s;uch an exalted Vertue; and, by the &s;ecret Methods of its Wi&s;dom, opened a Way for her to become the Greate&s;t of her Sex, a|mong tho&s;e, who profe&s;s that Faith to which &s;he adhered with &s;o much Chri&s;tian Magnani|mity.</P>
<P>This her illu&s;trious Conduct might, in the Eye of the World, have lo&s;t its Merit, had &s;o accompli&s;hed a Prince as his Royal Highne&s;s declared his Pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ame Alliance at that time: It would then have been no Wonder that all other Propo&s;als had been rejected. But it was the Fame of this heroick Con&s;tancy that determined his Royal Highne&s;s to de&s;ire in Marriage a Prince&s;s who&s;e per&s;onal Charms, which had before been &s;o univer&s;ally admired, were now become the lea&s;t Part of her Chara|cter. We of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation have rea&s;on to rejoice, that &s;uch a Propo&s;al was made and ac|cepted; and that her Royal Highne&s;s, with re|gard to the&s;e two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Treaties of Mar|riage, &s;hewed as much Prudence in her Com|pliance
<PB N="118" REF="127">
with the one, as Piety in her Refu&s;al of the other.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s was no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Hano|ver,</HI> than &s;he improved the Lu&s;tre of that Court, which was before reckoned among the Polite&s;t in <HI>Europe</HI>; and increa&s;ed the Satisfaction of that People, who were before looked upon as the Happie&s;t in the Empire. She immediately became the Darling of the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was acknowledged in all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Woman of the Age in which &s;he lived, and who was not a little plea|&s;ed with the Conver&s;ation of one in whom &s;he &s;aw &s;o lively an Image of her own Youth.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no longer on that Reputa|tion which Her Royal Highne&s;s has acquired in other Countries. We daily di&s;cover tho&s;e admirable Qualities for which &s;he is &s;o ju&s;tly famed, and rejoyce to &s;ee them exerted in our own Countrey, where we our &s;elves are made happy by their Influence. We are the more plea&s;ed to behold the Throne of the&s;e King|doms &s;urrounded by a numerous and beautiful Progeny, when we con&s;ider the Virtues of tho&s;e from whom they de&s;cend. Not only the Fea|tures, but the Mind of the Parent is often copi|ed out in the Offspring. But the Prince&s;s we are &s;peaking of, takes the &s;ure&s;t Method of making her Royal I&s;&s;ue like her&s;elf, by in&s;tilling early into their Minds all the Principles of Re+ligion, Virtue and Honour, and &s;ea&s;oning thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tender Years with all that Knowledge which they are capable of receiving.

The Conjugal Virtues are &s;o remarkable in her Royal Highne&s;s, as to de&s;erve tho&s;e ju&s;t and generous Returns of Love and Tenderne&s;s, for which the Prince her Husband is &s;o univer|&s;ally celebrated.</P>
<P>But there is no Part of her Royal Highne&s;s's Character which we ob&s;erve with greater Plea|&s;ure, than that Behaviour by which &s;he has &s;o much endear'd her&s;elf to His Maje&s;ty; tho' in|deed we have no Rea&s;on to be &s;urprized at this mutual Intercour&s;e of Duty and Affection, when we con&s;ider &s;o wi&s;e and virtuous a Prince&s;s po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, in the &s;ame &s;acred Per&s;on, the kinde&s;t of Fathers, and the be&s;t of Kings. And here it is natural for us to congratulate our own good Fortune, who &s;ee our Soveraign ble&s;t with a numerous I&s;&s;ue, among whom are Heirs Male in two direct De&s;cents, which has not happen|ed in the Reign of any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King &s;ince the Time of His Maje&s;ty's Great Ance&s;tor <HI>Ed|ward</HI> III. and is a Felicity not enjoyed by the Subjects of any other of the Kings of <HI>Europe</HI> who are his Contemporaries. We are like Men entertained with the View of a &s;pacious Land|skip, where the Eye pa&s;&s;es over one plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect into another, till the Sight is lo&s;t by degrees in a Succe&s;&s;ion of delightful Objects, and leaves us in the Per&s;ua&s;ion that there remain &s;till more behind.</P>
<P>But if we regard her Royal Highne&s;s in that Light which diffu&s;es the greate&s;t Glory round a Humane Character, we &s;hall find the Chri&s;ti|an no le&s;s con&s;picuous than the Prince&s;s. She is as eminent for a &s;incere Piety in the Practice of Religion, as for an inviolable Adherence to its Principles. She is con&s;tant in her Attendance on the daily Offices of our Church, and by her
<PB N="120" REF="129">
&s;erious and devout Comportment on the&s;e &s;o|lemn Occa&s;ions, gives an Example that is very often too much wanted in Courts.</P>
<P>Her Religion is equally free from the Weak|ne&s;s of Super&s;tition, and the Sourne&s;s of En|thu&s;ia&s;m. It is not of that uncomfortable me|lancholy Nature which di&s;appoints its own End, by appearing unamiable to tho&s;e whom it would gain to its Intere&s;ts. It di&s;covers it&s;elf in the genuine Effects of Chri&s;tianity, in Affability, Compa&s;&s;ion, Benevolence, Evenne&s;s of Mind, and all the Offices of an active and univer&s;al Charity.</P>
<P>As a cheerful Temper is the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of the&s;e Virtues, &s;o it &s;hines out in all the Parts of her Conver&s;ation, and di&s;&s;ipates tho&s;e Appre|hen&s;ions which naturally hang on the Timorous or the Mode&s;t, when they are admitted to the Honour of her Pre&s;ence. There is none that does not li&s;ten with Plea&s;ure to a Per&s;on in &s;o high a Station, who conde&s;cends to make her&s;elf thus agreeable, by Mirth without Levity, and Wit without Ill Nature.</P>
<P>Her Royal Highne&s;s is, indeed, po&s;&s;e&s;t of all tho&s;e Talents which make Conver&s;ation either delightful or improving. As &s;he has a fine Ta&s;te of the elegant Arts, and is skilled in &s;everal modern Languages, her Di&s;cour&s;e is not con|fined to the ordinary Subjects or Forms of Con|ver&s;ation, but can adapt it&s;elf with an uncom|mon Grace to every Occa&s;ion, and entertain the polite&s;t Per&s;ons of different Nations. I need not mention, what is ob&s;erved by every one, that agreeable Turn which appears in her Sen|timents upon the mo&s;t ordinary Affairs of Life, and which is &s;o &s;uitable to the Delicacy of her Sex, the Politene&s;s of her Education, and the Splendor of her Quality.</P>

It would be vain to think of drawing into the Compa&s;s of this Paper, the many eminent Vir|tues which adorn the Character of this Great Prince&s;s; but as it is one chief End of this Undertaking to make the People &s;en&s;ible of the Ble&s;&s;ings which they enjoy under His Maje&s;ty's Reign, I could not but lay hold on this Oppor|tunity to &s;peak of That which ought in Ju&s;tice to be reckoned among the greate&s;t of them.</P>

That I may give my Readers an Image of the&s;e Rural State&s;men, I &s;hall without farther Preface, &s;et down an Account of a Di&s;cour&s;e I chanced to have with one of them &s;ome Time ago. I was Travelling towards one of the remote Parts of <HI>England,</HI> when a|bout Three a-Clock in the Afternoon, &s;eeing a Countrey-Gentleman trotting before me with a Spaniel by his Hor&s;e's Side, I made up to him. Our Conver&s;ation opened, as u&s;ual, up|on the Weather; in which we were very una|nimous; having both agreed that it was too dry for the Sea&s;on of the Year. My Fellow-Tra|veller, upon this, ob&s;erved to me, that there had been no good Weather &s;ince the Revolution I was a little &s;tartled at &s;o extraordinary a Remark, but would not interrupt him till he proceeded to tell me of the fine Weather they u&s;ed to have in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign. I only an&s;wered that I did not &s;ee how the Badne&s;s of the Weather could be the King's Fault; and, without waiting for his Reply, ask|ed him who&s;e Hou&s;e it was we &s;aw upon a Ri&s;ing-Ground at a little Di&s;tance from us.

As we rode Side by Side through the Town, I was let into the Characters of all the principal Inhabitants whom we met in our Way.

out the jolly Landlord, who knew him by his Whi&s;tle. Many Endearments, and private Whi&s;pers pa&s;&s;ed between them; tho' it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, by the Landlord's &s;cratching his Head, that Things did not go to their Wi&s;hes. The Landlord had &s;well'd his Body to a prodi|gious Size, and work'd up his Complexion to a &s;tanding Crim&s;on by his Zeal for the Pro&s;pe|rity of the Church, which he expre&s;&s;ed every Hour of the Day, as his Cu&s;tomers dropt in, by repeated Bumpers. He had not time to go to Church him&s;elf, but as my Friend told me in my Ear, had headed a Mob at the pulling down of two or three Meeting-hou&s;es. While Supper was preparing, he enlarged upon the Happine&s;s of the neighbouring Shire; <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>there is &s;carce a Preshyterian in the whole County, except the Bi&s;hop.</HI> In &s;hort, I found by his Di&s;cour&s;e that he had learned a great deal of Politicks, but not one Word of Religion, from the Par|&s;on of his Pari&s;h; and, indeed, that he had &s;carce any other Notion of Religion, but that it con&s;i&s;ted in Hating Presbyterians. I had a remarkable In&s;tance of his Notions in this Par|ticular. Upon &s;eeing a poor decrepid Old Wo|man pa&s;s under the Window where we fate, he de&s;ired me to take Notice of her; and after|wards informed me, that &s;he was generally re|puted a Witch by the Countrey People, but that, for his Part, he was apt to believe &s;he was a Presbyterian.</P>
<P>Supper was no &s;ooner &s;erved in, than he took occa&s;ion, from a Shoulder of Mutton that lay before us, to cry up the Plenty of <HI>England,</HI> which would be the happie&s;t Countrey in the World, provided we would live within our &s;elves. Up|on which, he expatiated on the Inconveniencies

of Trade, that carried from us the Commodities of our Countrey, and made a Parcel of Up&s;tarts as rich as Men of the mo&s;t ancient Families of <HI>England.</HI> He then declared frankly, that he had always been again&s;t all Treaties and Alliances with Foreigners; <HI>Our Wooden Walls,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are our Security, and we may bid Defiance to the whole World, e&s;pecially if they &s;hould attack us when the Militia is out.</HI> I ventured to reply, that I had as great an Opinion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet as he had; but I could not &s;ee how they could be pay'd and mann'd, and fitted out, unle&s;s we en|couraged Trade and Navigation. He replied, with &s;ome Vehemence, That he would under|take to prove, Trade would be the Ruine of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. I would fain have put him upon it; but he contented him&s;elf with affirm|ing it more eagerly, to which he added two or three Cur&s;es upon the <HI>London</HI> Merchants, not forgetting the Directors of the Bank. After Supper he asked me if I was an Admirer of Punch; and immediately called for a Sneaker. I took this Occa&s;ion to in&s;inuate the Advan|tages of Trade, by ob&s;erving to him, that Wa|ter was the only Native of <HI>England</HI> that could be made u&s;e of on this Occa&s;ion: But that the Lemons, the Brandy, the Sugar, and the Nutmeg, were all Foreigners. This put him into &s;ome Confu&s;ion; but the Landlord, who overheard me, brought him off, by affirming, That for con|&s;tant u&s;e, there was no Liquor like a Cup of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Water, provided it had Malt enough in it. My Squire laughed heartily at the Con|ceit, and made the Landlord &s;it down with us. We &s;ate pretty late over our Punch; and, a|mid&s;t a great deal of improving Di&s;cour&s;e, drank the Healths of &s;everal Per&s;ons in the Countrey,

<P>IN the Wars of <HI>Europe</HI> which were waged among our Forefathers, it was u&s;ual for the Enemy, when there was a King in the Field, to demand by a Trumpet in what Part of the Camp he re&s;ided, that they might avoid firing upon the Royal Pavillion. Our Party-Conte&s;ts in <HI>England</HI> were hertofore managed with the &s;ame kind of Decency and Good-Breeding. The Per&s;on of the Prince was always looked upon as Sacred; and whatever &s;evere U&s;age his Friends or Mini&s;ters met with, none pre&s;umed to direct their Ho&s;tilities at their Soveraign.

The Enemies of our pre&s;ent Settlement are of &s;uch a coar&s;e kind of Make, and &s;o equally void of Loyalty and Good Manners, that they are grown Scurrilous upon the Royal Family, and treat the mo&s;t exalted Characters with the mo&s;t opprobrious Language.</P>
<P>This Petulance in Conver&s;ation is particular|ly ob&s;erved to prevail among &s;ome of that Sex where it appears the mo&s;t unbecoming and the mo&s;t unnatural. Many of the&s;e act with the greater Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e they know they can act with the greater Impunity. This Con|fideration, indeed, engages the mo&s;t generous and well-bred even of our She Malecontents, to make no ill U&s;e of the Indulgence of our Law-givers; and to di&s;cover in their Debates at lea&s;t the Delicacy of the Woman, if not the Duty of the Subject. But it is generally remark|ed, that every one of them who is a Shrew in dome&s;tick Life, is now become a Scold in Po|liticks. And as for tho&s;e of the Party, who are of a &s;uperior Rank and unblemi&s;hed Virtue, it mu&s;t be a melancholy Reflexion for them to con&s;ider that all the Common Women of the Town are of their Side; for which Rea&s;on they ought to pre&s;erve a more than ordinary Mode&s;ty in their Satyrical Excur&s;ions, that their Chara|cters may not be liable to Su&s;picion.</P>

<P>That when a Woman has talked an Hour and a half, it &s;hall be lawful to call her down to Order.</P>
<P>As this Civil Di&s;cord among the Si&s;terhood of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is likely to engage them in a long and lingring War, con&s;i&s;ting altogether of Drawn Battels, it is the more nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a Cartel &s;ettled among them.

<P>Di&s;cretion and good Nature have been always looked upon as the di&s;tingui&s;hing Ornaments of

<P>A Phy&s;ician makes U&s;e of various Methods for the Recovery of &s;ick Per&s;ons; and tho' &s;ome of them are painful, and all of them di&s;|agreeable,

his Patients are never angry at him, becau&s;e they know he has nothing in View be|&s;ides the re&s;toring of them to a good State of Health. I am forced to treat the di&s;affected Part of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects in the &s;ame Manner, and may therefore rea&s;onably expect the &s;ame Returns of Good-Will. I propo&s;e nothing to my &s;elf but their Happine&s;s as the End of all my Endeavours; and am forced to adapt different Remedies to tho&s;e different Con|&s;titutions, which are to be found in &s;uch a di|&s;temper'd Multitude. Some of them can &s;ee the unrea&s;onable, and &s;ome of them the ridicu|lous Side of wrong Principles, and, according to the different Frame of their Minds, reject an Opinion as it carries in it either the Appea|rance of Wickedne&s;s, or of Danger, or of Folly.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to expo&s;e in the&s;e &s;eve|ral Lights the Notions and Practices of tho&s;e who are the Enemies to our pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h|ment. But there is a Set of Arguments, which I have not yet touched upon, and which often &s;ucceed, when all others fail. There are ma|ny who will not quit a Project, tho' they find it pernicious, or ab&s;urd: But will readily de&s;i&s;t from it, when they are convinced it is imprac|ticable. An Attempt to &s;ubvert the pre&s;ent Government is, God be thanked, of this Na|ture. I &s;hall therefore apply the Con&s;iderati|ons of this Paper rather to the Di&s;cretion than the Virtue of our Malecontents, who &s;hould act in the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs like expe|rienced Game&s;ters, that throw up their Cards when they know the Game is in the Enemy's Hand, without giving them&s;elves any unnece&s;|&s;ary Vexation in playing it out.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">
In the Reign of our two la&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sove|raigns, tho&s;e who did not favour their Intere&s;t might be ungenerous enough to act upon the Pro&s;pect of a Change, con&s;idering the precari|ous Condition of their Health, and their Want of I&s;&s;ue to &s;ucceed them. But at pre&s;ent we enjoy a King of a long-lived Family, who is in the Vigour of his Age, and ble&s;t with a nume|rous Progeny. To this we may add his remar|kable Steadine&s;s in adhering to tho&s;e Schemes which he has formed upon the mature&s;t Deli|beration, and that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Deference of his Royal Highne&s;s both from Duty and Inclina|tion to all the Mea&s;ures of his Royal Father. Nor mu&s;t we omit that per&s;onal Valour &s;o pe|culiar to His Maje&s;ty and his Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, which would be &s;ufficient to vanqui&s;h, as we find it actually deters, both his foreign and do|me&s;tick Enemies.</P>
<P>This Great Prince is &s;upported by the whole Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;trengthened with a long Range of Alliances that reach from one End of the Continent to the other. He has a great and powerful King for his Son-in-Law; and can Him&s;elf command when he plea&s;es the whole Strength of an Electorate in the Empire. Such a Combination of Sove|raigns puts one in Mind of the Apparition of Gods which di&s;couraged <HI>Aeneas</HI> from oppo&s;ing the Will of Heaven. When his Eyes were clear|ed of that mortal Cloud which hung upon them, he &s;aw the &s;everal Cele&s;tial Deities acting in a Confederacy again&s;t him, and immediately gave up a Cau&s;e which was excluded from all Po&s;&s;i|bility of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is the greate&s;t Happine&s;s, as well as the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure of our Soveraign, that his
<PB N="134" REF="143">
chief Strength lies in his own Kingdoms. Both the Branches of our Legi&s;lature e&s;pou&s;e his Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t with a becoming Duty and Zeal. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable and wealthy of his Sub|jects are convinced, that the Pro&s;perity of our Soveraign and his People are in&s;eparable: And we are very well &s;atisfied, that his Maje&s;ty, if the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs &s;hould require it, might find, among the mo&s;t dutiful of his Subjects, Men celebrated for their military Characters, a|bove any of the Age in which they live. There is no Que&s;tion but his Maje&s;ty will be as gene|rally valued and beloved in his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> as he is in his <HI>German</HI> Dominions, when he &s;hall have Time to make his Royal Virtues equally known among us. In the mean while we have the Sa|tisfaction to find, that his Enemies have been only able to make ill Impre&s;&s;ions upon the low and ignorant Rabble of the Nation; and to put the Dregs of the People into a Ferment.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een how poor and con|temptible a Force has been rai&s;ed by tho&s;e who have dared to appear openly again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and how they were headed and encouraged by Men who&s;e Sen&s;e of their Guilt made them de&s;perate in forming &s;o ra&s;h an Enterprize, and di&s;pirited in the Execution of it. But we have not yet &s;een that Strength which would be ex|erted in the Defence of His Maje&s;ty, the Prote|&s;tant Religion, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberties, were the Danger great enough to require it. Should the King be reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting up the Royal Standard, how many Thou&s;ands would range them&s;elves under it! What a Con|cour&s;e would there be of Nobles and Patriots! We &s;hould &s;ee Men of another Spirit than what has appeared among the Enemies to our Coun|trey,
<PB N="135" REF="144">
and &s;uch as would out-&s;hine the rebellious Part of their Fellow-Subjects as much in their Gallantry as in their Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;o much &s;u&s;pect the Under&s;tand|ings of our Adver&s;aries, as to think it nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the&s;e Con&s;iderations, by putting them in Mind of that Fidelity and Allegiance which is &s;o vi&s;ible in His Maje&s;ty's Fleet and Army, or of many other Particulars which, in all humane Probability, will perpetuate our pre&s;ent Form of Government, and which may be &s;ugge&s;ted to them by their own private Thoughts.</P>
<P>The Party, indeed, that is oppo&s;ite to our pre|&s;ent happy Settlement, &s;eem to be driven out of the Hopes of all human Methods for carry|ing on their Cau&s;e, and are therefore reduced to the poor Comfort of Prodigies and old Wo|men's Fables. They begin to &s;ee Armies in the Clouds, when all upon the Earth have for&s;aken them. Nay, I have been lately &s;hewn a writ|ten Prophecy that is handed among them with great Secre&s;y, by which it appears their chief Reliance at pre&s;ent is upon a <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Miller that was born with two Thumbs upon one hand.</P>
<P>I have addre&s;&s;ed this whole Paper to the De|&s;pair of our Malecontents, not with a De&s;ign to aggravate the Pain of it, but to u&s;e it as a Means of making them happy. Let them &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;ider the Vexation and Di&s;quietude of Mind that they are trea&s;uring up for them|&s;elves, by &s;truggling with a Power which will be always too hard for them; and by convert|ing His Maje&s;ty's Reign into their own Mi&s;|fortune, which every impartial Man mu&s;t look upon as the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing to his Countrey. Let them extingui&s;h tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which can only imbitter their Lives to them, and deprive
<PB N="136" REF="145">
them of their Share in the Happine&s;s of the Com|munity. They may conclude that His Maje&s;ty, in Spite of any Oppo&s;ition they can form again&s;t him, will maintain his ju&s;t Authority over them; and whatever Unea&s;ine&s;s they may give them|&s;elves, they can create none in him, excepting only becau&s;e they prevent him from exerting equally his natural Goodne&s;s and Benevolence to every Subject in his Dominions.</P>

<P>IF we may believe the Ob&s;ervation which is made of us by Foreigners, there is no Na|tion in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much given to Change as the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> There are &s;ome who a&s;cribe this to the Ficklene&s;s of our Climate; and Others to the Freedom of our Government. From one or both of the&s;e Cau&s;es their Writers derive that Variety of Humours which appears among the People in general, and that Incon&s;i&s;tency of Cha|racter which is to be found in almo&s;t every par|ticular Per&s;on. But as a Man &s;hould always be upon his Guard again&s;t the Vices to which he is mo&s;t expo&s;ed, &s;o we &s;hould take a more than ordinary Care not to lie at the Mercy of the Weather in our moral Conduct, nor to make a capricious U&s;e of that Liberty which we en|joy by the Happine&s;s of our Civil Con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">
This In&s;tability of Temper ought in a parti|cular Manner to be check'd, when it &s;hews it|&s;elf in Political Affairs, and di&s;po&s;es Men to wander from one Scheme of Government to another: Since &s;uch a Ficklene&s;s of Behavi|our in publick Mea&s;ures, cannot but be attend|ed with very fatal Effects to our Countrey.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place; It hinders any great Un|dertaking, which requires Length of Time for its Accompli&s;hment, from being brought to its due Perfection. There is not any In&s;tance in Hi&s;tory which better confirms this Ob&s;ervation, than that which is &s;till fre&s;h in every one's Me|mory. We engaged in the late War with a De&s;ign to reduce an exorbitant Growth of Power in the mo&s;t Dangerous Enemy to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> We gained a long and wonderful Se|ries of Victories, and had &s;carce any Thing left to do; but to reap the Fruits of them: When on a &s;udden our Patience failed us; we grew tired of our Undertaking; and received Terms from tho&s;e, who were upon the Point of giv|ing us whatever we could have demanded of them.</P>
<P>This Mutability of Mind in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> makes the ancient Friends of our Nation very back|ward to engage with us in &s;uch Alliances as are nece&s;&s;ary for our mutual Defence and Se|curity. It is a common Notion among Fo|reigners, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are good Confederates in an Enterprize which may be di&s;patched with|in a &s;hort Compa&s;s of Time; but that they are not to be depended upon in a Work which cannot be fini&s;hed without Con&s;tancy and Per|&s;everance. Our late Mea&s;ures have &s;o blemi|&s;hed the National Credit in this Particular, that tho&s;e Potentates who are entered into Treaties
<PB N="138" REF="147">
with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, have been &s;olely en|couraged to it by their Confidence in His per|&s;onal Firmne&s;s and Integrity.</P>
<P>I need not, after this, &s;ugge&s;t to my Reader the Ignominy and Reproach that falls upon a Nation, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it &s;elf among its Neighbours by &s;uch a wavering and un&s;ettled Conduct.</P>
<P>This our Incon&s;i&s;tency in the Pur&s;uit of Schemes which have been thoroughly dige&s;ted, has as bad an Influence on our Dome&s;tick as on our Foreign Affairs. We are told, that the Famous Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> u&s;ed to ask the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, upon the Arrival of a Mail, <HI>Who was Secretary of State in</HI> England <HI>by that Po&s;t</HI>? as a Piece of Raillery upon the Ficklene&s;s of our Politicks. But what has render'd this a Misfortune to our Countrey, is, that Publick Mini&s;ters have no &s;ooner made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, than they have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their Employments; and that this Di&s;grace has befallen very many of them, not becau&s;e they have de&s;erved it, but becau&s;e the People love to &s;ee new Faces in High Po&s;ts of Honour.</P>
<P>It is a double Misfortune to a Nation, which is thus given to Change, when they have a So|veraign at the Head of them, that is prone to fall in with all the Turns and Veerings of the People. <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> the Grave&s;t of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians, who had form'd his Notions of Re|gal Authority from the Manner in which he &s;aw it exerted among the Barbarous Nations, makes the following Remark: <HI>Plerumque Re|giae Voluntates, uti vehementes, &s;ic mobiles, &s;aepe ip&s;ae &s;ibi advor&s;ae. The Wills of Kings, as they are generally vehement, are likewi&s;e very fickle,</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="148">
<HI>and at different Times oppo&s;ite to them&s;elves.</HI> Were there any Colour for this general Ob|&s;ervation, how much does it redound to the Honour of &s;uch Princes who are Exceptions to it&punc;</P>
<P>The natural Con&s;equence of an un&s;teady Go|vernment, is the perpetuating of Strife and Fac|tion among a divided People. Whereas a King who per&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e Schemes which He has laid, and has no other View in them but the Good of His Subjects, extingui&s;hes all Hopes of Advancement in tho&s;e who would grow Great by an Oppo&s;ition to His Mea&s;ures, and in&s;en&s;ibly unites the Contending Parties in their Common Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who makes the greate&s;t Fi|gure among our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soveraigns, was mo&s;t eminently remarkable for that Steadine&s;s and Uniformity which ran through all Her Acti|ons, during that long and Glorious Reign. She kept up to Her cho&s;en Motto in every Part of Her Life; and never lo&s;t Sight of tho&s;e Great Ends, which She propo&s;ed to Her&s;elf on Her Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, the Happine&s;s of Her People, and the &s;trengthening of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t. She often interpo&s;ed Her Royal Au|thority to break the Cabals which were forming again&s;t her Fir&s;t Mini&s;ters, who grew old and died in tho&s;e Stations which they filled with &s;o great Abilities. By this Means &s;he baffled the many Attempts of her foreign and dome&s;tick Enemies, and entirely broke the whole Force and Spirit of that Party among her Subjects, which was popi&s;hly affected, and which wasnot a little Formidable in the Beginning of her Reign.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="149">
The frequent Changes and Alterations in publick Proceedings, the Multiplicity of Schemes introduced one upon another, with the Variety of &s;hort-lived Favourites, that prevailed in their &s;everal Turns under the Government of Her Succe&s;&s;ors, have by Degrees broken us into tho&s;e unhappy Di&s;tinctions and Parties, which have given &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s to our Kings, and &s;o often endangered the Safety of their People.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but every Impartial Reader hath been before-hand with me, in con&s;idering on this Occa&s;ion, the Happine&s;s of our Countrey under the Government of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; who is &s;o de&s;ervedly Famous for an inflexible Adhe|rence to tho&s;e Coun&s;els which have a vi&s;ible Tendency to the publick Good, and to tho&s;e Per&s;ons who heartily concur with Him in pro|moting the&s;e His generous De&s;igns.</P>
<P>A Prince of this Character will be dreaded by his Enemies, and &s;erved with Courage and Zeal by his Friends; and will either in&s;truct us by his Example, to fix the Un&s;teadine&s;s of our Politicks, or by his Conduct, hinder it from doing us any Prejudice.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, as there is no Temper of Mind more unmanly in a private Per&s;on, nor more pernicious to the Publick in a Member of a Community, than that Changeablene&s;s with which we are too ju&s;tly branded by all our Neighbours, it is to be hoped that the &s;ound Part of the Nation will give no farther Occa&s;i|on for this Reproach, but continue &s;teady to that happy E&s;tabli&s;hment which has now taken place among us. And as Ob&s;tinacy in Prejudices which are detrimental to our Countrey, ought not to be mi&s;taken for that virtuous Re&s;olution and Firmne&s;s of Mind which is nece&s;&s;ary to our
<PB N="141" REF="150">
Pre&s;ervation, it is to be wi&s;hed that the Enemies to our Con&s;titution, would &s;o far indulge them|&s;elves in this National Humour, as to come in|to one Change more, by falling in with that Plan of Government which at pre&s;ent they think fit to oppo&s;e. At lea&s;t we may expect they will be &s;o wi&s;e as to &s;hew a Legal Obedience to the be&s;t of Kings, who profe&s;s the Duty of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience to the Wor&s;t.</P>

<P>WHen the <HI>Athenians</HI> had long contended a|gain&s;t the Power of <HI>Philip,</HI> he demanded of them to give up their Orators, as well know|ing their Oppo&s;ition would be &s;oon at an end if it were not irritated from Time to Time by the&s;e Tongue-Warriors. I have endeavoured for the &s;ame Rea&s;on to gain our Female Adver&s;a|ries, and by that Means to di&s;arm the Party of its principal Strength. Let them give us up their Women, and we know by Experience how in|con&s;iderable a Re&s;i&s;tance we are to expect from their Men.</P>
<P>This &s;harp political Humour has but lately prevailed in &s;o great a Mea&s;ure as it now does among the beautiful Part of our Species. They u&s;ed to employ them&s;elves wholly in the Scenes of a dome&s;tick Life, and provided a Woman could keep her Hou&s;e in Order, &s;he never trou|bled her&s;elf about regulating the Common|wealth.
<PB N="142" REF="151">
The Eye of the Mi&s;tre&s;s was wont to make her Pewter &s;hine, and to in&s;pect every Part of her Hou&s;hold Furniture as much as her Looking Gla&s;s. But at pre&s;ent our di&s;content|ed Matrons are &s;o conver&s;ant in Matters of State, that they wholly neglect their private Affairs: for we may always ob&s;erve that a Go&s;|&s;ip in Politicks, is a Slattern in her Family.</P>
<P>It is indeed a melancholy Thing to &s;ee the Di&s;orders of a Hou&s;hold that is under the Con|duct of an angry State&s;woman, who lays out all her Thoughts upon the Publick, and is only attentive to find out Mi&s;carriages in the Mini|&s;try. Several Women of this Turn are &s;o ear|ne&s;t in contending for Hereditary Right, that they wholly neglect the Education of their own Sons and Heirs; and are &s;o taken up with their Zeal for the Church, that they cannot find Time to teach their Children their Catechi&s;m. A Lady who thus intrudes into the Province of the Men, was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a Character among the old <HI>Romans,</HI> that when <HI>Amae&s;ia</HI> pre&s;ented her&s;elf to &s;peak before the Senate, they looked upon it as a Prodigy, and &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to inquire of the Oracle, what it might portend to the Commonwealth?</P>
<P>It would be manife&s;tly to the Di&s;advantage of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Cau&s;e, &s;hould our pretty Loy|ali&s;ts profe&s;s an Indifference in State-Affairs, while their di&s;affected Si&s;ters are thus indu&s;trious to the Prejudice of their Countrey; and accor|dingly we have the Satisfaction to find our She-A&s;&s;ociates are not idle upon this Occa&s;ion. It is owing to the good Principles of the&s;e His Maje&s;ty's fair and faithful Subjects, that our Countrey-Women appear no le&s;s amiable in the Eyes of the Male-World, than they have done
<PB N="143" REF="152">
in former Ages. For where a great Number of Flowers grow, the Ground at a Di&s;tance &s;eems entirely cover'd with them, and we mu&s;t walk into it, before we can di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal Weeds that &s;pring up in &s;uch a beautiful Ma&s;s of Colours. Our great Concern is, to find that Deformity can ari&s;e among &s;o many Charms, and that the mo&s;t lovely Parts of the Creation can make them&s;elves the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable. But it is an Ob&s;ervation of the Philo&s;ophers, that the be&s;t Things may be corrupted into the wor&s;t; and the Ancients did not &s;cruple to af|firm, that the Furies and the Graces were of the &s;ame Sex.</P>
<P>As I &s;hould do the Nation and them&s;elves good Service, if I could draw the Ladies, who &s;till hold out again&s;t His Maje&s;ty, into the In|tere&s;t of our pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hall pro|po&s;e to their &s;erious Con&s;ideration, the &s;everal Inconveniencies which tho&s;e among them un|dergo, who have not yet &s;urrender'd to the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>They &s;hould fir&s;t reflect on the great Suf|ferings and Per&s;ecutions to which they expo&s;e them&s;elves by the Ob&s;tinacy of their Behaviour. They lo&s;e their Elections in every Club where they are &s;et up for Toa&s;ts. They are obliged by their Principles to &s;tick a Patch on the mo&s;t unbecoming Side of their Fore-heads. They forego the Advantage of Birth-Day Suits. They are in&s;ulted by the Loyalty of Claps and Hi&s;&s;es every Time they appear at a Play. They re|ceive no Benefit from the Army, and are never the better for all the young Fellows that wear Hats and Feathers. They are forced to live in the Countrey and feed their Chicken; at the &s;ame Time that they might &s;hew them&s;elves at
<PB N="144" REF="153">
Court, and appear in Brocade, if they behaved them&s;elves well. In &s;hort, what mu&s;t go to the Heart of every fine Woman, they throw them|&s;elves quite out of the Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The above-mention'd Motive mu&s;t have an Influence upon the gay Part of the Sex; and as for tho&s;e who are acted by more &s;ublime and moral Principles, they &s;hould con&s;ider, that they cannot &s;ignalize them&s;elves as Malecon|tents, without breaking through all the amiable In&s;tincts and &s;ofter Virtues, which are peculi|arly Ornamental to Womankind. Their timo|rous, gentle, mode&s;t Behaviour; their Affabili|ty, Meekne&s;s, Good-Breeding, and many other beautiful Di&s;po&s;itions of Mind mu&s;t be &s;a|crificed to a blind and furious Zeal for they do not know what. A Man is &s;tartled when he &s;ees a pretty Bo&s;om heaving with &s;uch Party-Rage, as is di&s;agreeable even in that Sex which is of a more coar&s;e and rugged Make. And yet &s;uch is our Misfortune, that we &s;ometimes &s;ee a Pair of Stays ready to bur&s;t with Sedition; and hear the mo&s;t ma&s;culine Pa&s;&s;ions expre&s;t in the &s;weete&s;t Voices. I have lately been told of a Countrey-Gentlewoman, pretty much famed for this Virility of Behaviour in Party-Di&s;putes. who, upon venting her Notions very freely in a &s;trange Place, was carry'd before an hone&s;t Ju&s;tice of Peace. This prudent Magi&s;trate ob|&s;erving her to be a large black Woman, and finding by her Di&s;cour&s;e that &s;he was no bet|ter than a Rebel in a Riding-Hood, began to &s;u&s;pect her for my Lord <HI>Nithi&s;dale</HI>; till a Stranger came to her Re&s;cue, who a&s;&s;ur'd him, with Tears in his Eyes, that he was her Hus|band.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="154">
In the next Place our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies may con&s;ider, that by intere&s;ting them&s;elves &s;o zea|lou&s;ly in the Affairs of the Publick, they are engaged, without any nece&s;&s;ity, in the Crimes which are often committed even by the Be&s;t of Parties, and which they are naturally exempted from by the Privilege of their Sex. The wor&s;t Character a Female could formerly arrive at, was of being an ill Woman; but by their pre|&s;ent Conduct, &s;he may likewi&s;e de&s;erve the Cha|racter of an ill Subject. They come in for their Share of political Guilt, and have found a Way to make them&s;elves much greater Criminals, than their Mothers before them.</P>
<P>I have great Hopes that the&s;e Motives, when they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their own Reflections, will incline the Fair Ones of the adver&s;e Party to come over to the National Intere&s;t, in which their own is &s;o highly concern'd; e&s;pecially if they con&s;ider, that by the&s;e &s;uperfluous Em|ployments which they take upon them as Par|ti&s;ans, they do not only dip them&s;elves in an unnece&s;&s;ary Guilt, but are obnoxious to a Grief and Angui&s;h of Mind, which doth not proper|ly fall within their Lot.

<P>IT is an old Ob&s;ervation, that a Time of Peace is always a Time of Prodigies; for as our News-Writers mu&s;t adorn their Papers with that which the Criticks call, <HI>The Marvellous,</HI> they are forced in a dead calm of Affairs, to ran&s;ack every Element for proper Amu&s;ements, and ei|ther to a&s;toni&s;h their Readers from Time to Time with a &s;trange and wonderful Sight, or be con|tent to lo&s;e their Cu&s;tom. The Sea is generally filled with Mon&s;ters when there are no Fleets upon it. Mount <HI>Aetna</HI> immediately began to rage upon the Extinction of the Rebellion: And woe to the People of <HI>Catanea,</HI> if the Peace conti|nues; for they are &s;ure to be &s;haken every Week with Earthquakes, till they are relieved by the Siege of &s;ome other great Town in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Air has likewi&s;e contributed its Quota of Prodi|gies. We had a Blazing Star by the la&s;t Mail from <HI>Genea</HI>; and in the pre&s;ent Dearth of Battels have been very opportunely entertained, by Per|&s;ons of undoubted Credit, with a Civil War in the Clouds, where our &s;harp-&s;ighted Malecon|tents di&s;covered many Objects invi&s;ible to an Eye that is dim'd by <HI>Whig-</HI>Principles.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but this Paper will fall in with the pre&s;ent Humour, &s;ince it contains a very remarkable Vi&s;ion of a <HI>Highland</HI> Seer, who is famous among the Mountains, and known by the Name of <HI>Second-Sighted-Sawney.</HI> Had he been
<PB N="147" REF="156">
able to Write, we might probably have &s;een this Vi&s;ion &s;ooner in Print; for it happened to him very early in the late hard Winter; and is tran&s;|mitted to me by a Student of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> who took the whole Relation from him, and &s;tuck clo&s;e to the Facts, though he has delivered them in his own Style.</P>
<P><HI>Sawney</HI> was de&s;cended of an ancient Family, very much renowned for their Skill in Prog|no&s;ticks. Mo&s;t of his Ance&s;tors were Second-Sighted, and his Mother but narrowly e&s;caped being burnt for a Witch. As he was going out one Morning very early to &s;teal a Sheep, he was &s;eized on the &s;udden with a Fit of Se|cond-Sight. The Face of the whole Countrey about him was changed in the Twinkling of an Eye, and pre&s;ented him with a wide Pro&s;pect of new Scenes and Objects, which he had ne|ver &s;een till that Day.</P>
<P>He di&s;covered at a great Di&s;tance from him a large Fabrick, which ca&s;t &s;uch a gli&s;tering Light about it, that it looked like a huge Rock of Diamond. Upon the Top of it was planted a Standard, &s;treaming in a &s;trong Northern Wind, and embroidered with a Mixture of Thi|&s;les and Flower-de-luces. As he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf with this &s;trange Sight, he heard a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at &s;ome Di&s;tance behind him, and, turn|ing about, &s;aw a General, who &s;eemed very much animated with the Sound of it, marching towards him at the Head of a numerous Ar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">.

<PB N="148" REF="157">
with &s;o much Horrour, that he &s;hivered eve|ry Joynt all the while he &s;poke of it. They were forced to clamber over &s;o many Rocks, and to tread upon the Brink of &s;o many Preci|pices, that they were very often in danger of their Lives. <HI>Sawney</HI> declared, that, for his own Part, he walked in fear of his Neck every Step he took. Upon their coming within a few Furlongs of the Temple, they pa&s;&s;ed through a very thick Grove, con&s;ecrated to a Deity who was known by the Name of <HI>Trea&s;on.</HI> They here di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into abundance of Labyrinths and covered Walks which led to the Temple. The Path was &s;o very &s;lippery, the Shade &s;o exceeding gloomy, and the whole Wood &s;o full of Ecchoes, that they were forced to march with the greate&s;t Warine&s;s, Circum&s;pection and Silence. They at length arrived at a great Gate, which was the principal Avenue to that magnifi|cent Fabrick. <HI>Sawney</HI> &s;tood &s;ome Time at the En|trance to ob&s;erve the Splendour of the Building, and was not a little entertained with a prodi|gious Number of Statues, which were planted up and down in a &s;pacious Court that lay be|fore it; but, upon examining it more nicely, he found the whole Fabrick, which made &s;uch a glittering Appearance, and &s;eemed Impregnable was compo&s;ed of Ice, and that the &s;everal Statues which &s;eemed at a di&s;tance to be made of the white&s;t Marble, were nothing el&s;e but &s;o many Figures in Snow. The Front of the Temple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> very curiou&s;ly adorned with Stars and Garters&punc; Ducal Coronets, General's Staffs, and many o+ther Emblems of Honour wrought in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> beautiful Fro&s;t-Work. After having &s;tood at ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> &s;ome Time before this great Gate, he di&s;cover+ed on it an In&s;cription, &s;ignifying it to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

<HI>Gate of Perjury.</HI> There was erected near it a great Colo&s;&s;us in Snow that had two Faces, and was dre&s;t like a <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> with one of its Hands upon a Book, and the other gra&s;ping a Dagger. Upon entring into the Court, he took a particu|lar Survey of &s;everal of the Figures. There was Sedition with a Trumpet in her Hand, and Rapine in the Garb of a Highlander: Ambiti|on, Envy, Di&s;grace, Poverty, and Di&s;appoint|ment, were all of them repre&s;ented under their proper Emblems. Among other Statues, he ob&s;erved that of Rumour whi&s;pering an Ideot in the Ear, who was the Repre&s;entative of Cre|dulity; and Faction embracing with her hun|dred Arms an old-fa&s;hioned Figure in a Steeple-Crown'd Hat, that was de&s;ign'd to expre&s;s a cunning old Gip&s;y, call'd Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience. Zeal too had a Place among the re&s;t, with a Bandage over her Eyes, tho' one would not have expected to have &s;een her repre&s;ented in Snow. But the mo&s;t remarkable Object in this Court-Yard, was a huge Tree that grew up be|fore the Porch of the Temple, and was of the &s;ame kind with that, which <HI>Virgil</HI> tells us flou|ri&s;hed at the Entrance of the infernal Regions. For it bore nothing but Dreams, which hung in Clu&s;ters under every Leaf of it. The Travellers refre&s;hed them&s;elves in the Shade of this Tree before they entered the <HI>Temple of Rebellion,</HI> and after their Frights and Fatigues, received great Comfort in the Fruit which fell from it. At length the Gates of the Temple flew open, and the Crowd ru&s;hed into it. In the Centre of it was a grim Idol, with a Sword in the Right Hand, and a Firebrand in the Left. The Fore-part of the Pede&s;tal was curiou&s;ly embo&s;|&s;ed with a Triumph, while the Back-part, that
<PB N="150" REF="159">
lay more out of Sight, was filled with Gibbets and Axes. This dreadful Idol is wor&s;hipped like &s;everal of old, with human Sacrifices, and his Votaries were con&s;ulting among them&s;elves, how to gratify him with Hecatombs; when, on a &s;udden, they were &s;urprized with the Alarm of a great Light which appeared in the Southern Part of the Heavens, and made its Progre&s;s di|rectly towards them. This Light appeared as a great Ma&s;s of Flame, or rather Glory, like that of the Sun in its Strength. There were three Figures in the mid&s;t of it, who were known by their &s;everal Hieroglyphicks, to be Religion, Loyalty, and Valour. The la&s;t had a graceful Air, a blooming Countenance, and a Star upon its Brea&s;t, which &s;hot forth &s;everal pointed Beams of a peculiar Lu&s;tre. The Glory which encompa&s;&s;ed them, covered the Place, and darted its Rays with &s;o much Strength, that the whole Fabrick and all its Ornaments began to melt. The &s;everal Emblems of Honour, which were wrought on the Front in the brittle Materials above-mentioned, trickled away un|der the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of the Heat. In &s;hort, the Thaw was &s;o violent, that the Temple and Statues ran off in a &s;udden Torrent, and the whole Winter-Piece was di&s;&s;olved. The cove|red Walks were laid open by the Light which &s;hone through every Part of them, and the Dream-Tree withered like the famous Gourd, that was &s;mitten by the Noon-Day Sun. As for the Votaries, they left the Place with the greate&s;t Precipitation, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves by Flight into a Thou&s;and different Paths a|mong the Mountains.</P>

<P>SIR <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> in the Dedication before his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, ob&s;erves, that peaceable Times are the be&s;t to live in, though not &s;o proper to furni&s;h Materials for a Writer: As hilly Countries afford the mo&s;t en|tertaining Pro&s;pects, though a Man would chu&s;e to travel through a plain One. To this we may add, That the Times, which are full of Di&s;or|ders and Tumults, are likewi&s;e the fulle&s;t of In|&s;truction. Hi&s;tory indeed furni&s;hes us with very di&s;tinct Accounts of Factions, Con&s;piracies, Civil Wars and Rebellions, with the fatal Con|&s;equences that attend them: But they do not make &s;uch deep and la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ions on our Minds, as Events of the &s;ame Nature, to which we have our &s;elves been Witne&s;&s;es, and in which we or our Friends and Acquaintance have been Sufferers. As Adver&s;ity makes a Man Wi&s;e in his private Affairs, civil Calamities give him Prudence and Circum&s;pection in his publick Conduct.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;eries of the Civil War under the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, and the Con|&s;equences which en&s;ued upon them, did, for many Years, deter the Inhabitants of our I&s;land from the Thoughts of engaging anew in &s;uch de&s;perate Undertakings; and convinced them,
<PB N="152" REF="161">
by fatal Experience, that nothing could be &s;o pernicious to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;o oppo&s;ite to the Genius of the People, as the Subver&s;ion of Monarchy. In the like Manner we may hope that the great Expences brought upon the Na|tion by the pre&s;ent Rebellion; the Sufferings of innocent People, who have lived in that Place which was the Scene of it; with that dreadful Pro&s;pect of Ruine and Confu&s;ion which mu&s;t have followed its Succe&s;s; will &s;ecure us from the like Attempts for the future, and fix His Ma|je&s;ty upon the Throne of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; e&s;peci|ally when tho&s;e who are prompted to &s;uch wick|ed Practices reflect upon the Puni&s;hments to which the Criminals have expo&s;ed them&s;elves, and the Mi&s;eries in which they have involved their Relations, Friends and Families.</P>
<P>It will be likewi&s;e worth their while to con|&s;ider, how &s;uch Tumults and Riots, as have been encouraged by many, who, we may hope did not propo&s;e to them&s;elves &s;uch fatal Con&s;e|quences, lead to a Civil War: and how natu|rally that &s;editious kind of Conver&s;ation, which many &s;eem to think con&s;i&s;tent with their Reli|gion and Morality, ends in an open Rebellion. I que&s;tion not but the more virtuous and con|&s;iderate Part of our Malecontents are now &s;tung with a very ju&s;t Remor&s;e for this their Manner of Proceeding, which has &s;o vi&s;ibly tended to the De&s;truction of their Friends, and the Suffer|ings of their Countrey. This may, at the &s;ame Time, prove an in&s;tructive Le&s;&s;on to the Bolde&s;t and Brave&s;t among the Di&s;&s;affected, not to build any Hopes upon the talkative Zealots of their Party; who have &s;hewn by their whole Beha|viour, that their Hearts are equally filled with Trea&s;on and Cowardice. An Army of Trumpe|ters
<PB N="153" REF="162">
would give as great a Strength to a Cau&s;e, as this Confederacy of Tongue-Warriours; who like tho&s;e military Mu&s;icians, content them&s;elves with animating their Friends to Battel, and run out of the Engagement upon the fir&s;t On&s;et.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Maxims we can learn from the pre&s;ent Rebellion, is, That no|thing can be more contemptible and in&s;ignifi|cant, than the Scum of a People, when they are in&s;tigated again&s;t a King, who is &s;upported by the Two Branches of the Legi&s;lature. A Mob may pull down a Meeting Hou&s;e, but will ne|ver be able to over-turn a Government, which has a courageous and wi&s;e Prince at the Head of it, and one who is zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the great Council of the Nation, that be&s;t know the Value of him. The Authority of the Lords and Com|mons of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in Conjunction with that of their Soveraign, is not to be controul'd by a tumultuary Rabble. It is big with Fleets and Armies, can fortify it&s;elf with what Laws it &s;hall judge proper for its own Defence, can command the Wealth of the Kingdom for the Security of the People, and engage the whole Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> in &s;o good and ju&s;t a Cau&s;e. A di&s;orderly Multitude contending with the Body of the Legi&s;lature, is like a Man in a Fit under the Conduct of one in the Full|ne&s;s of his Health and Strength. Such a one is &s;ure to be over-ruled in a little Time, though he deals about his Blows, and exerts him&s;elf in the mo&s;t furious Convul&s;ions while the Di&s;temper is upon him.</P>
<P>We may farther learn from the Cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent Rebellion, who among the foreign States in our Neighbourhood are the true and natural Friends of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> if we ob&s;erve
<PB N="154" REF="163">
which of them gave us their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in re|ducing our Countrey to a State of Peace and Tranquillity; and which of them u&s;ed their En|deavours to heighten our Confu&s;ions, and plunge us into all the Evils of a Civil War. I &s;hall only take Notice under this Head, that in for|mer Ages it was the con&s;tant Policy of <HI>France</HI> to rai&s;e and cheri&s;h inte&s;tine Feuds and Di&s;cords in the I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that we might ei|ther fall a Prey into their Hands, or that they might pro&s;ecute their De&s;igns upon the Conti|nent with le&s;s Interruption. Innumerable In|&s;tances of this Nature occur in Hi&s;tory. The mo&s;t remarkable One was that in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. Though that Prince was married to a Daughter of <HI>France,</HI> and was per&s;o|nally beloved and e&s;teemed in the <HI>French</HI> Court, it is well known that they abetted both Parties in the Civil War, and always furni&s;hed Supplies to the weaker Side, le&s;t there &s;hould be an End put to tho&s;e fatal Divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We might al&s;o ob&s;erve, that this Rebellion has been a Means of di&s;covering to His Maje|&s;ty, how much he may depend upon the Pro|fe&s;&s;ions and Principles of the &s;everal Parties among his own Subjects; who are tho&s;e Per|&s;ons that have e&s;pou&s;ed his Intere&s;ts with Zeal or Indifference; and who among them are in|fluenced to their Allegiance by Places, Duty, or Affection. But as the&s;e, and &s;everal other Con&s;iderations, are obvious to the Thoughts of every Reader. I &s;hall conclude, with ob&s;erving how naturally many of tho&s;e, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the Name of the <HI>High-Church,</HI> unite them&s;elves to the Cau&s;e of <HI>Popery</HI>; &s;ince it is manife&s;t that all the Prote&s;tants concerned
<PB N="155" REF="164">
in the Rebellion, were &s;uch as gloried in this Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>It would be very unju&s;t, to charge all who have ranged them&s;elves under this new Deno|mination, as if they had done it with a De&s;ign to favour the Intere&s;ts of Popery. But it is cer|tain that many of them, who at their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out were mo&s;t aver&s;e to the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> have by the Cunning of our Adver&s;aries, been in&s;pired with &s;uch an un|rea&s;onable Aver&s;ion to their Prote&s;tant Brethren, and taught to think &s;o favourably of the <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Principles, (not to mention the Endea|vours that have been u&s;ed to reconcile the Do|ctrines of the Two Churches, which are in them&s;elves as oppo&s;ite as Light and Darkne&s;s) that they have been drawn over in&s;en&s;ibly in|to its Intere&s;ts. It is no wonder, therefore, that &s;o many of the&s;e deluded Zealots have been engaged in a Cau&s;e which they at fir&s;t abhorr'd, and have wi&s;hed or acted for the Succe&s;s of an Enterprize, that might have ended in the Extir|pation of the Prote&s;tant Religion in this King|dom, and in all <HI>Europe.</HI> In &s;hort, they are like the <HI>Syrians,</HI> who were fir&s;t &s;mitten with Blind|ne&s;s, and unknowingly led out of their Way into the Capital of their Enemy's Countrey; in&s;omuch that the Text tells us, <HI>When they open|ed their Eyes, they found them&s;elves in the mid&s;t of</HI> Samaria.</P>

<P>THis being a Day in which the Thoughts of our Countreymen are, or ought to be em|ployed on &s;erious Subjects, I &s;hall take the Op|portunity of that Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind in my Rea|ders, to recommend to them the Practice of tho&s;e Religious and Moral Virtues, without which all Policy is vain, and the be&s;t Cau&s;e de|prived of its greate&s;t Ornament and Support.</P>
<P>Common Sen&s;e, as well as the Experience of all Ages, teaches us, that no Government can flouri&s;h which doth not encourage and propa|gate Religion and Morality among all its parti|cular Members. It was an Ob&s;ervation of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> that their Empire had not more increa&s;ed by the Strength of their Arms, than by the Sanctity of their Manners: And <HI>Cicero,</HI> who &s;eems to have been better ver&s;ed than any of them, both in the Theory and the Practice of Politicks, makes it a Doubt, whether it were po&s;&s;ible for a Community to exi&s;t that had not a prevailing Mixture of Piety in its Con&s;tituti|on. Ju&s;tice, Temperance, Humility, and al|mo&s;t every other Moral Virtue, do not only de|rive the Ble&s;&s;ings of Providence upon tho&s;e who exerci&s;e them, but are the natural Means for acquiring the publick Pro&s;perity. Be&s;ides; Re|ligious
<PB N="157" REF="166">
Motives and In&s;tincts are &s;o bu&s;y in the Heart of every rea&s;onable Creature, that a Man who would hope to govern a Society without any regard to the&s;e Principles, is as much to be contemned for his Folly, as to be dete&s;ted for his Impiety.</P>
<P>To this we may add, that the World is never &s;unk into &s;uch a State of Degeneracy, but they pay a natural Veneration to Men of Virtue; and rejoyce to &s;ee them&s;elves conducted by tho&s;e, who act under the Awe of a &s;upreme Being, and who think them&s;elves accountable for all their Proceedings to the great Judge and Superintendent of human Affairs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of our Fellow-Subjects, who are &s;en|&s;ible of the Happine&s;s they enjoy in His Maje|&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, are obliged, by all the Duties of Gratitude, to adore that Pro|vidence which has &s;o &s;ignally interpo&s;ed in our Behalf, by clearing a Way to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion through &s;uch Difficulties as &s;eemed in&s;uperable; by detecting the Con&s;piracies which have been formed again&s;t it; and, by many wonderful Events, weakening the Hands and baffling the Attempts of all His Maje&s;ty's Ene|mies, both foreign and dome&s;tick.</P>
<P>The Party, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their Zeal for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;hould be careful, in a particular Manner, to di&s;cover in their whole Conduct &s;uch a Reverence for Religion, as may &s;hew how groundle&s;s that Reproach is which is ca&s;t upon them by their Enemies, of being aver&s;e to our national Wor|&s;hip.

Too many of them are al|ready dipt in the Guilt of Perjury and Sedition&punc; and as we remain unblemi&s;hed in the&s;e Particu|lars, let us endeavour to excel them in all the other Parts of Religion, and we &s;hall quickly find, that a regular Morality is, in its own Na|ture, more popular, as well as more meritori|ous, than an intemperate Zeal.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e, in the pre&s;ent Times of Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, an Opportunity of &s;hewing our Abhorrence of &s;everal Principles which have been a&s;cribed to us by the Malice of our Enemies. A Di&s;affection to Kings and Kingly Government, with a Pronene&s;s to Re|bellion, have been often very unju&s;tly charged on that Party which goes by the Name of <HI>Whigs.</HI> Our &s;teady and continued Adherence to His Ma|je&s;ty and the pre&s;ent happy Settlement, will the mo&s;t effectually confute this Calumny. Our Adver&s;aries, who know very well how odious Common-wealth Principles are to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, have inverted the very Sen&s;e of Words and Things, rather than not continue to brand us with this imaginary Guilt: For with &s;ome of the&s;e Men, at pre&s;ent, Loyalty to our King is Republicani&s;m, and Rebellion Pa&s;&s;ive-Obe|dience.</P>
<P>It has been an old Objection to the Principles of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> that &s;everal of their Leaders, who have been zealous for redre&s;&s;ing the Grievances of Government, have not behaved them&s;elves better than the <HI>Tories</HI> in dome&s;tick Scenes of Life: But at the &s;ame time have been publick
<PB N="159" REF="168">
Patriots and private Oppre&s;&s;ors. This Obje|ction, were it true, has no Weight in it, &s;ince the Misbehaviour of particular Per&s;ons does not at all affect their Cau&s;e, and &s;ince a Man may act laudably in &s;ome Re&s;pects, who does not &s;o in others. However, it were to be wi&s;hed, that Men would not give occa&s;ion even to &s;uch In|vectives; but at the &s;ame time they con&s;ult the Happine&s;s of the Whole, that they would pro|mote it to their utmo&s;t in all their private Deal|ings among tho&s;e who lie more immediately within their Influence. In the mean while I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this Reproach, which may be of|ten met with both in Print and Conver&s;ation, tends in reality to the Honour of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> as it &s;uppo&s;es that a greater Regard to Ju&s;tice and Humanity is to be expected from them, than from tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite Party: And it is cer|tain we cannot better recommend our Princi|ples, than by &s;uch Actions as are their natural and genuine Fruits.</P>
<P>Were we thus careful to guard our &s;elves in a particular Manner again&s;t the&s;e groundle&s;s Im|putations of our Enemies, and to ri&s;e above them as much in our Morality as in our Politicks, our Cau&s;e would be always as flouri&s;hing as it is ju&s;t. It is certain, that our Notions have a more natural Tendency to &s;uch a Practice, as we e&s;pou&s;e the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in Oppo&s;ition to that of Popery, which is &s;o far from advancing Morality by its Doctrines, that it has weakned or entirely &s;ubverted, many of the Duties even of Natural Religion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, with recommending one Vir|tue more to the Friends of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, wherein the <HI>Whigs</HI> have been remarkably deficient; which is a general Unanimity and
<PB N="160" REF="169">
Concurrence in the Pur&s;uit of &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are nece&s;&s;ary for the well-being of their Coun|trey. As it is a laudable Freedom of Thought which un&s;hackles their Minds from the poor and narrow Prejudices of Education, and opens their Eyes to a more exten&s;ive View of the pub|lick Good; the &s;ame Freedom of Thought di&s;|po&s;es &s;everal of them to the embracing of par|ticular Schemes and Maxims, and to a certain Singularity of Opinion which proves highly prejudicial to their Cau&s;e; e&s;pecially when they are encouraged in them by a vain Breath of Po|pularity, or by the artificial Prai&s;es which are be&s;towed on them by the oppo&s;ite Party. This Temper of Mind, though the Effect of a noble Principle, very often betrays their Friends, and brings into Power the mo&s;t pernicious and im|placable of their Enemies. In Ca&s;es of this Na|ture, it is the Duty of an hone&s;t and prudent Man, to &s;acrifice a doubtful Opinion to the concurring Judgment of tho&s;e whom he believes to be well intentioned to their Countrey, and who have better Opportunities of looking into all its mo&s;t complicated Intere&s;ts. An hone&s;t Party of Men acting with Unanimity, are of in|finitely greater Con&s;equence than the &s;ame Party aiming at the &s;ame End by different Views: As a large Diamond is of a thou&s;and Times greater Value whil&s;t it remains entire, than when it is cut into a Multitude of &s;maller Stones, notwith&s;tanding they may, each of them, be ve|ry curiou&s;ly &s;et, and are all of the &s;ame Water.</P>

<P>AS I was &s;ome Years ago engaged in Conver|&s;ation with a Fa&s;hionable French <HI>Abb&eacute;</HI> up|on a Subject which the People of that Kingdom love to &s;tart in Di&s;cour&s;e, the comparative Greatne&s;s of the two Nations; he asked me, <HI>How many Souls I thought there might be in</HI> Lon|don? I replied, being willing to do my Coun|trey all the Honour I fairly could, That there were &s;everal who computed them at near a Mil|lion: But not finding that Surprize I expected in his Countenance, I returned the Que&s;tion up|on him, How many he thought there might be in <HI>Paris</HI>? To which he an&s;wered, with a certain Grimace of Coldne&s;s and Indifference, <HI>About ten or twelve Millions.</HI></P>
<P>It would, indeed, be incredible to a Man who has never been in <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould one relate the extravagant Notion they entertain of them&s;elves and the mean Opinion they have of their Neigh|bours. There are certainly (notwith&s;tanding the vi&s;ible Decay of Learning and Ta&s;te which has appear'd among them of late Years) many par|ticular Per&s;ons in that Countrey, who are emi|nent in the highe&s;t Degree for their Good Sen&s;e, as well as for their Knowledge in all the Arts and Sciences. But I believe every one, who is ac|quainted with them, will allow, that the People in general fall far &s;hort of tho&s;e, who border upon them, in Strength and Solidity of Under&s;tand|ing.
<PB N="162" REF="171">
One would therefore no more wonder to &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;hallow Nation of <HI>Europe</HI> the mo&s;t Vain, than to find the mo&s;t empty Fellows in every di&s;tinct Nation more conceited and cen&s;orious than the re&s;t of their Countreymen. Prejudice and Self-Sufficiency naturally proceed from Inexperience of the World, and Ignorance of Mankind. As it requires but very &s;mall A|bilities to di&s;cover the Imperfections of another, we find that none are more apt to turn their Neighbours into Ridicule, than tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t Ridiculous in their own private Conduct.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e among the <HI>French,</HI> who have &s;een no|thing but their own Countrey, can &s;carce bring them&s;elves to believe, that a Nation, which lies never &s;o little North of them, is not full of <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals.</HI> Nay tho&s;e among them who travel into foreign Parts are &s;o prejudiced in favour of their own imaginary Politene&s;s, that they are apt to look upon every thing as barbarous in Propor|tion as it deviates from what they find at Home. No le&s;s a Man than an Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> being in Conver&s;ation with our King of glori|ous Memory, and willing to encourage his Ma|je&s;ty, told him, that he talked like a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> The King &s;miled at the Encomium which was given him, and only reply'd, <HI>Sir, I am &s;ure you do.</HI> An eminent Writer of the la&s;t Age was &s;o offended at this Kind of In&s;olence, which &s;hewed it&s;elf very plentifully in one of their Travellers who gave an Account of <HI>England,</HI> that he vin|dicated the Honour of his Countrey in a Book full of ju&s;t Satyr and Ingenuity. I need not ac|quaint my Reader, that I mean Bi&s;hop <HI>Sprat</HI>'s An&s;wer to <HI>Sorbiere.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="172">
Since I am upon this Head, I cannot forbear mentioning &s;ome profound Remarks that I have been lately &s;hewn in a <HI>French</HI> Book, the Author of which lived it &s;eems, &s;ome Time in <HI>England. The</HI> Engli&s;h, &s;ays this curious Traveller, <HI>very much delight in</HI> Pudding. <HI>This is the favourite Di&s;h not only of the Clergy, but of the People in general. Provided there be a</HI> Pudding <HI>upon the Table, no matter what are the other Di&s;hes; they are &s;ure to make a Fea&s;t. They think them&s;elves &s;o happy when they have a</HI> Pudding <HI>before them, that if any one would tell a Friend he is arrived in a lucky Juncture, the ordinary Salutation is, Sir, I am glad to &s;ee you; you are come in</HI> Pudding-Time.</P>
<P>One cannot have the Heart to be angry at this judicious Ob&s;erver, notwith&s;tanding he has treated us like a Race of <HI>Hottentots,</HI> becau&s;e he only taxes us with our inordinate Love of Pud|ding, which it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, is not &s;o ele|gant a Di&s;h as Frog and Sallat. Every one who has been at <HI>Paris,</HI> knows that <HI>Un gros Milord Anglois</HI> is a frequent Je&s;t upon the <HI>French</HI> Stage; as if Corpulence was a proper Subject for Satyr, or a Man of Honour could help his being Fat, who Eats &s;uitable to his Quality.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to recount the Invectives which are to be met with among the <HI>French</HI> Hi|&s;torians, and even in <HI>Mezeray</HI> him&s;elf, again&s;t the Manners of our Countreymen. Their Au|thors in other Kinds of Writing are likewi&s;e very liberal in Characters of the &s;ame Nature. I cannot forbear mentioning the learned Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Patin</HI> in particular; who tells us in &s;o ma|ny Words, <HI>That the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>are a People, whom he naturally abhors:</HI> And in another place, <HI>That he looks upon the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>among the &s;everal Nati|ons</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="173">
<HI>of Men, as he does upon Wolves among the &s;e|veral Species of Bea&s;ts.</HI> A <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Writer would be very ju&s;tly charged with want of Politene&s;s, who in return to this Civility, &s;hould look up|on the <HI>French</HI> as that Part of Mankind which an&s;wers to a Species in the Brute Creation, whom we call in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by the Name of Monkies.</P>
<P>If the <HI>French</HI> load us with the&s;e Indignities, we may ob&s;erve, for our Comfort, that they give the re&s;t of their Borderers no better Quar|ter. If we are a dull, heavy, phlegmatick Peo|ple, we are it &s;eems no wor&s;e than our Neigh|bours. As an In&s;tance, I &s;hall &s;et down at large a remarkable Pa&s;&s;age in a famous Book intituled <HI>Chevraeana,</HI> written many Years ago by the celebrated Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chevreau</HI>; after having adverti&s;ed my Reader that the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who are mentioned in it, were the late excel|lent Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> and her Si&s;ter.</P>

<P>Having already run my Paper out to its u&s;ual Length, I have not room for many Reflections on that which is the Subject of it.

It will however be rea&s;onable for us, if we concur with them in their Con|tempt of other neighbouring Nations, that we &s;hould likewi&s;e regard our &s;elves under the &s;ame View in which they are wont to place us. The Repre&s;entations they make of us, are as of a Nation the lea&s;t favoured by them; and, as the&s;e are agreeable to the natural Aver&s;ion they have for us, are more di&s;advantageous than the Pictures they have drawn of any other People in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>I am the more prompted to this Undertaking by a Pamphlet entituled, <HI>An Argument to prove the Affections of the People of</HI> England <HI>to be the be&s;t Security of the Government; humbly offer'd to the Con&s;ideration of the Patrons of Severity, and ap|ply'd to the pre&s;ent Juncture of Affairs.</HI> Had the whole Scope of the Author been an&s;werable to his Title, he would have only undertaken to prove what every Man in his Wits is already convinced of. But the Drift of the Pamphlet is to &s;tir up our Compa&s;&s;ion towards the Rebels, and our Indignation again&s;t the Government. The Author, who knew that &s;uch a De&s;ign as this, could not be carried on without a great deal of Artifice and Sophi&s;try, has puzzled and per|plex'd his Cau&s;e, by throwing his Thoughts to|gether in &s;uch a &s;tudy'd Confu&s;ion, that upon this Account, if upon any, his Pamphlet is, as the Party have repre&s;ented it, Unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>The famous Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bayle</HI> compares the an&s;wering of an immethodical Author to the Hunting of a Duck: When you have him full in your Sight, and fancy your &s;elf within reach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, he gives you the Slip, and becomes in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ble.

<P><PB N="168" REF="177">
The Writer of this Pamphlet could, doubt+le&s;s, have ranged his Thoughts in much bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Order, if he had plea&s;ed: But he knew very well, that Error is not to be advanced by Per+&s;picuity. In order therefore to an&s;wer this Pamphlet, I mu&s;t reduce the Sub&s;tance of it un|der proper Heads; and di&s;embroil the Thoughts of the Author, &s;ince he did not think fit to do it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the Terms which the Author makes u&s;e of are loo&s;e, general, and undefined, as will be &s;hewn in the Sequel of this Paper; and what le&s;s be|comes a fair Rea&s;oner, he puts wrong and in|vidious Names on every thing to colour a fal&s;e Way of Arguing. He allows that <HI>the Rebels indi&s;putably merit to be &s;everely Cha&s;ti&s;ed</HI>; that they <HI>de&s;erve it according to Law</HI>; and that <HI>if they are puni&s;hed they have none to thank but them&s;elves,</HI> (p. 7.) How can a Man after &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion make u&s;e &s;ometimes of the Word <HI>Cruelty,</HI> but generally of <HI>Revenge,</HI> when he pleads again&s;t the Exerci&s;e of what, according to his own Notion, is at the mo&s;t but rigid Ju&s;tice! Or why are &s;uch Executions, which, according to his own Opinion, are legal, &s;o often to be cal|led <HI>Violences</HI> and <HI>Slaughter</HI>? Not to mention the Appellations given to tho&s;e who do not agree with him in his Opinion for Clemency, as the <HI>Blood-thir&s;ty,</HI> the <HI>Political Butchers, State Chiru|geons,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall now &s;peak of that Point, which is the great and reigning Fallacy of the Pamphlet, and runs more or le&s;s through every Paragraph. His whole Argument turns upon this &s;ingle Con|&s;ideration; Whether the King &s;hould exert Mer|cy or Ju&s;tice towards tho&s;e who have openly
<PB N="169" REF="178">
appeared in the pre&s;ent Rebellion? By Mercy he means a general Pardon, by Ju&s;tice a general Puni&s;hment: So that he &s;uppo&s;es no other Me|thod practicable in this Juncture, than either the Forgiving All, or the Executing All. Thus he puts the Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether it be the Intere&s;t of the Prince to de&s;troy the Rebels by Fire, Sword, or Gibbet</HI>? (p. 4.) And, &s;peaking of the <HI>Zealots for the Government,</HI> he tells us, <HI>They think no Re|medy &s;o good, as to make clear Work; and that they declare for the utter Extirpation of All who are its Enemies in the mo&s;t minute Circum&s;tance: As if Amputation were the &s;ole Remedy the&s;e political Butchers cou'd find out for the Di&s;tempers of a State; or that they thought the only Way to make the Top flou|ri&s;h, were to lop off the Under Branches.</HI> (p. 5.) He then &s;peaks of the <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e Polititians, and the Ca&s;ui&s;ts in Red-Coats; Who,</HI> he tells us, <HI>are for the utmo&s;t Rigour that their Laws of War or Laws of Convenience can in&s;pire them with.</HI> (p. 5.) Again, <HI>It is repre&s;ented,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that the Rebels de&s;erve the highe&s;t Puni&s;hment the Laws can inflict.</HI> (p. 7.) And afterwards tells us, <HI>The Que&s;tion is, Whe|ther the Government &s;hall &s;hew Mercy, or take a Reverend Divine's Advice, to &s;lay Man and Wo|man, In&s;ant and Suckling</HI>? (p. 8) Thus again he tells us, <HI>The Friends to &s;evere Coun&s;els alledge, that the Government ought not to be moved by com|pa&s;&s;ion</HI>; and that <HI>the Law &s;hould have its Cour&s;e.</HI> (p. 9.) And in another Place puts the&s;e Words in their Mouths, <HI>He may &s;till retain their Affe|ction, and yet let the Laws have their Cour&s;e in puni&s;hing the Guilty.</HI> (p. 18.) He goes upon the &s;ame Suppo&s;ition in the following Pa&s;&s;ages; <HI>It is impracticable in &s;o general a Corruption, to de|&s;troy</HI> All <HI>who are infected; and unle&s;s you de&s;troy</HI> All <HI>you do nothing to the purpo&s;e</HI> (p 10.) <HI>Shall our</HI>

<HI>Rightful King &s;hew him&s;elf le&s;s the true Father of his People, and afford his Pardon to</HI> None <HI>of tho&s;e People, who (like King</HI> Lear <HI>to his Daughters) had &s;o great a Confidence in his Virtue as to give him All.</HI> (p. 25.) I &s;hall only add, that the con|cluding Paragraph, which is worked up with &s;o much artificial Horrour, goes upon a Sup|po&s;ition an&s;werable to the whole Tenor of the Pamphlet; and implies, that <HI>the Impeach'd Lords</HI> were to be Executed without Exception or Di&s;|crimination.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what is the Author's Idea of that Ju&s;tice again&s;t which all his Arguments are le|vell'd. If, in the next Place, we con&s;ider the Nature of that Clemency which he recom|mends, we find it to be no le&s;s univer&s;al and unre&s;train'd.</P>
<P>He declares for a <HI>General Act of Indemnity.</HI> (p. 20.) and tells us, <HI>It is the Sen&s;e of every di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate Man of the Kingdom, that the Rebels may, and ought to be Pardoned,</HI> (p. 19.) <HI>One po|pular Act,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>wou'd even yet retrieve all,</HI> (p. 21.) He declares him&s;elf not <HI>over-fond of the Doctrines of making Examples of Traitors.</HI> (ibid.) And that <HI>the Way to prevent Things from being brought to an Extremity, is to deal mildly with tho&s;e unfortunate Gentlemen engaged in the Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader may now &s;ee in how fallacious a Manner this Writer has &s;tated the Contro|ver&s;y: He &s;uppo&s;es there are but two Methods of treating the Rebels; that is, by cutting oft every one of them to a Man, or pardoning eve|ry one of them without Di&s;tinction. Now it there be a third Method between the&s;e two Ex|tremes, which is on all Accounts more eligible than either of them, it is certain that the whole Cour&s;e of his Argumentation comes to nothing
<PB N="171" REF="180">
Every Man of the plaine&s;t Under&s;tanding will ea&s;ily conclude, that in the Ca&s;e before us, as in mo&s;t others, we ought to avoid both Ex|tremes; that to de&s;troy every Rebel would be an exce&s;&s;ive Severity, and to forgive every one of them an unrea&s;onable Weakne&s;s. The pro|per Method of Proceeding, is that which the Author has purpo&s;ely omitted: Namely, to tem|per Ju&s;tice with Mercy; and, according to the different Circum&s;tances that aggravate or alle|viate the Guilt of the Offenders, to re&s;train the Force of the Laws, or to let them take their proper Cour&s;e. Puni&s;hments are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew there is Ju&s;tice in a Government, and Pardons to &s;hew there is Mercy; and both to|gether convince the People, that our Con&s;ti|tution under a good Admini&s;tration does not only make a Difference between the Guilty and the Innocent, but even among the Guilty be|tween &s;uch as are more or le&s;s criminal.</P>
<P>This middle Method which has been always practi&s;ed by wi&s;e and good Governors, has hi|therto been made u&s;e of by our Soveraign. If, indeed, a Stranger, and one who is altogether unacquainted with His Maje&s;ty's Conduct, &s;hould read this Pamphlet, he would conclude that every Per&s;on engaged in the Rebellion was to die <HI>by the Sword, the Halter, or the Axe</HI>; nay, that their Friends and Abettors were involved in the &s;ame Fate. Would it be po&s;&s;ible for him to imagine, that of the &s;everal Thou&s;ands open|ly taken in Arms, and liable to Death by the Laws of their Countrey, not above Forty have yet &s;uffered? How would he be &s;urpriz'd to hear, that, notwith&s;tanding His Maje&s;ty's Troops have been Victorious in every Engagement, more of His Friends have lo&s;t their Lives in
<PB N="172" REF="181">
this Rebellion, than of His traiterous Subjects; though we add to tho&s;e who have dy'd by the Hand of Ju&s;tice tho&s;e of them who fell in Bat|tel? And yet we find a more popular Compa&s;|&s;ion endeavoured to be rai&s;ed for the Deaths of the Guilty, who have brought &s;uch Calamities on their Countrey, than for the Innocent who peri&s;hed in the Defence of it.</P>
<P>This middle Method of Proceeding, which has been pur&s;ued by His Maje&s;ty, and is wil|fully overlooked by the Author, be&s;t an&s;wers the Ends of Government; which is to maintain the Safety of the Publick by Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments. It is al&s;o incumbent on a Gover|nor, according to the received Dictates of Re|ligion: Which in&s;tructs us, <HI>That he beareth not the Sword in vain; but ought to be a Terror to E|vil-doors, and a Prai&s;e to them that do Well.</HI> It is likewi&s;e in a particular manner the Duty of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, who obliges him&s;elf by his Coro|nation-Oath to execute <HI>Ju&s;tice in Mercy,</HI> that is, to mix them in his Admini&s;tration, and not to exerci&s;e either of them to the total Exclu&s;ion of the other.</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider the Arguments which this Author gives for Clemency, from the good Ef|fects it would produce, we &s;hall find, that they hold true only when apply'd to &s;uch a Mercy as &s;erves rather to mitigate than exclude Ju&s;tice. The Excellence of that unlimited Clemency which the Author contends for, is recommend|ed by the following Arguments.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it endears a Prince to his People. This he de&s;cants on in &s;everal Parts of his Book. <HI>Clemency will endear his Per&s;on to the Nation; and then they will neither have the Power nor Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> to di&s;turb him.</HI> (p. 8.) <HI>Was there ever a cruel</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="182">
<HI>Prince, that was not hated by his Subjects</HI>? (p. 24.) <HI>A mercifull good-natur'd Di&s;po&s;ition is of all others the mo&s;t amiable Quality, and in Princes always attended with a popular Love,</HI> (p. 18.)</P>
<P>It is certain, that &s;uch a popular Love will always ri&s;e towards a Good Prince, who exer|ci&s;es &s;uch a Mercy as I have before de&s;cribed, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of the Con|&s;titution, and the Good of his Kingdom. But if it be thrown away at random, it lo&s;es its Virtue, le&s;&s;ens the E&s;teem and Authority of a Prince, and cannot long recommend him, even to the weake&s;t of his Subjects, who will find all the Effects of Cruelty in &s;uch an ill-ground|ed Compa&s;&s;ion. It was a famous Saying of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> and is quoted to his Honour by Hi&s;torians. "Who&s;oever &s;pares perjured Men, Robbers, Plunderers and Traitors, deprives all good Men of their Peace and Quietne&s;s, and lays a Foundation of innumerable Mi&s;chiefs to the Virtuous and Innocent."</P>
<P>Another Argument for unlimited Clemency, is, that it &s;hews a couragious Temper: <HI>Clemen|cy is likewi&s;e an Argument of Fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s; where|as Cruelty not only betrays a weak, abject, depra|ved Spirit, but al&s;o is for the mo&s;t part a certain Sign of Cowardice.</HI> (p. 19.)&mdash;<HI>He had a truly great Soul, and &s;uch will always di&s;dain the Coward's Vir|tue, which is Fear; and the Con&s;equence of it, which is Revenge.</HI> (p. 27.) This Panegyrick on Cle|mency, when it is governed by Rea&s;on, is like|wi&s;e very right; but it may &s;o happen, that the putting of Laws in Execution again&s;t Traitors to their Countrey may be the Argument of Fear|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, when our Governors are told that they dare not do it; and &s;uch Methods may be made u&s;e of to extort Pardons, as would make it look
<PB N="174" REF="183">
like Cowardice to grant them. In this la&s;t Ca&s;e the Author &s;hould have remembred his own Words, that <HI>then only Mercy is meritorious when it is voluntary, and not extorted by the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs,</HI> (p. 13.) Be&s;ides the Author &s;hould have con&s;idered, that another Argument which he makes u&s;e of for his Clemency, are the Re&s;ent|ments that may ari&s;e from the Execution of a Rebel: An Argument adapted to a cowardly, not a fearle&s;s Temper. This he infers from the Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>the Friends, Well-wi&s;hers, or A&s;&s;o|ciates of the Sufferers,</HI> (p. 4.) <HI>Re&s;entment will in|flame &s;ome; in others Compa&s;&s;ion will, by degrees, ri&s;e into Re&s;entment. This will naturally beget a Di&s;po&s;ition to overturn what they di&s;like, and then there will want only a fair Opportunity,</HI> (p. 12.) This Argument like mo&s;t of the others, pleads equal|ly for Malefactors of all kinds, whom the Go|vernment can never bring to Ju&s;tice, without di&s;obliging their Friends, Well-wi&s;hers, or A&s;|&s;ociates. But, I believe, if the Author would Conver&s;e with any Friend, Well-wi&s;her, or A&s;&s;ociate of the&s;e Sufferers, he would find them rather deterr'd from their Practices by their Suf|ferings, than di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e in a new Rebellion to revenge them. A Government mu&s;t be in a ve|ry weak and melancholy Condition, that is not armed with a &s;ufficient Power for its own De|fence again&s;t the Re&s;entment of its Enemies, and is afraid of being overturn'd if it does Ju|&s;tice on tho&s;e who attempt it. But I am afraid the main Rea&s;on, why the&s;e Friends, Well-wi&s;hers and A&s;&s;ociates are again&s;t Puni&s;hing any of the Rebels, is that which mu&s;t be an Argu|ment with every wi&s;e Governor for doing Ju|&s;tice upon &s;ome of them; namely, that it is a likely Means to come at the Bottom of this
<PB N="175" REF="184">
Con&s;piracy, and to detect tho&s;e who have been the private Abettors of it, and who are &s;till at work in the &s;ame De&s;ign; if we give Credit to the Sugge&s;tions of our Malecontents them&s;elves, who labour to make us believe that there is &s;till Life in this wicked Project.</P>
<P>I am wonderfully &s;urprized to &s;ee another Argument made u&s;e of for a general Pardon, which might have been urged more properly for a general Execution. The Words are the&s;e; <HI>The Generality will never be brought to believe, but that tho&s;e who &s;uffer only for Trea&s;on have very hard Mea&s;ure, nor can you with all your Severity unde|ceive them of their Error.</HI> If the Generality of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have &s;uch a favourable Opinion of Trea&s;on, nothing can cure them of an Error &s;o fatal to their Countrey as the Puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who are guilty of it. It is evident, that a General Impunity would confirm them in &s;uch an Opinion: For the Vulgar will never be brought to believe, that there is a Crime where they &s;ee no Penalty. As it is certain no Error can be more de&s;tructive to the very Being of Government than this, a proper Remedy ought to be applied to it: And I would ask this Au|thor, Whether upon this Occa&s;ion, <HI>The Doctrine of making Examples of Traitors</HI> be not very &s;ea|&s;onable; though he declares him&s;elf <HI>not over|fond of it.</HI> The way to awaken Men's Minds to the Sen&s;e of this Guilt, is to let them &s;ee by the Sufferings of &s;ome who have incurr'd it how hainous a Crime it is in the Eye of the Law.</P>
<P>The foregoing An&s;wer may be apply'd like|wi&s;e to another Argument of the &s;ame Nature. <HI>If the Faction be as numerous as is pretended; if the Spirit has &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole Kingdom; if it has mixed with the Ma&s;s of the People; then</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="185">
<HI>certainly all bloody Mea&s;ures will but whet Men the more for Revenge.</HI> If Ju&s;tice inflicted on a few of the mo&s;t flagrant Criminals, with Mercy ex|tended to the Multitude, may be called <HI>bloody Mea&s;ures,</HI> they are without doubt ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in ca&s;e the Spirit of Faction be thus &s;pread among the Ma&s;s of the People; who will readily conclude, that if open Rebellion goes unpuni&s;hed, every Degree of Faction which leads to it mu&s;t be altogether innocent.</P>
<P>I am come now to another Argument for Pardoning all the Rebels, which is, that it would in&s;pire them all with Gratitude, and reduce them to their Allegiance. <HI>It is truly Heroick to over|come the Hearts of one's Enemies; and when it is compa&s;&s;ed, the Undertaking is truly Politick.</HI> (p. 8.) <HI>He has now a fair Opportunity of Conquering more Enemies by one Act of Clemency, than the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful General will be able to do in many Cam|paigne.</HI> (p. 9.) <HI>Are there not infinite Numbers who would become mo&s;t Dutiful upon any fair Invitation, upon the lea&s;t Appearance of Grace</HI>? (p. 13.) <HI>Which of the Rebels could be ungrateful enough to re&s;i&s;t or abu&s;e Goodne&s;s exemplified in Practice, as well as extoll'd in Theory</HI>? (p. 20.) Has not His Maje&s;ty then &s;hewn the lea&s;t Appearance of Grace in that generous Forgivene&s;s which he has already extended to &s;uch great Numbers of his Rebel|lious Subjects, who mu&s;t have died by the Laws of their Countrey, had not his Mercy interpos'd in their Behalf? But if the Author means (as he doth, thro' this whole Pamphlet by the like Expre&s;&s;ions) an univer&s;al Forgivene&s;s, no unpre|judiced Man can be of his Opinion, that it wou'd have had this good Effect. We may &s;ee how little the Conver&s;ion of Rebels is to be depend|ed on, when we ob&s;erve that &s;everal of the
<PB N="177" REF="186">
Leaders in this Rebellion were Men who had been pardoned for Practices of the &s;ame Nature: And that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered, have avowed their Per&s;everance in their Rebellious Principles, when they &s;poke their Minds at the Place of Execution, notwith&s;tanding their Pro|fe&s;&s;ions to the contrary while they &s;olicited Forgivene&s;s. Be&s;ides, were Pardon extended indifferently to All, which of them would think him&s;elf under any particular Obligation? Where|as by that prudent Di&s;crimination which His Maje&s;ty has made between the Offenders of dif|ferent Degrees, He naturally obliges tho&s;e whom he has con&s;idered with &s;o much Tender|ne&s;s, and di&s;tingui&s;hed as the mo&s;t proper Ob|jects of Mercy. In &s;hort, tho&s;e who are pardoned would not have known the Value of Grace, if none had felt the Effects of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit another Rea&s;on which the Author makes u&s;e of again&s;t Puni&s;hments; <HI>Be|cau&s;e,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>tho&s;e very Means, or the Appre|hen&s;ions of them, have brought Things to the pa&s;s in which they are, and con&s;equently will reduce them from bad to wor&s;e,</HI> (p. 10.) And afterwards, <HI>This Growth of Di&s;&s;affection is in a great Mea&s;ure owing to the groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies Men entertain'd of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, as if they were to ex|pect nothing but Cruelty under it.</HI> If our Author would have &s;poken out, and have applied the&s;e Effects to the real Cau&s;e, he could a&s;cribe this Change of Affections among the People to no|thing el&s;e but the Change of the Mini&s;try: For we find that a great many Per&s;ons lo&s;t their Loyalty with their Places; and that their Friends have ever &s;ince made u&s;e of the mo&s;t ba&s;e Me|thods to infu&s;e tho&s;e groundle&s;s Di&s;contents into the Minds of the Common People, which
<PB N="178" REF="187">
have brought &s;o many of them to the Brink of De&s;truction, and proved &s;o detrimental to their Fellow-Subjects. However, this Proceeding has &s;hewn how dangerous it would have been for His Maje&s;ty to have continued in their Pla|ces of Tru&s;t a Set of Men, &s;ome of whom have &s;ince actually joined with the Pretender to His Crown: While others may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected never to have been faithfull to Him in their Hearts, or, at lea&s;t, who&s;e Principles are pre|carious, and vi&s;ibly conducted by their Intere&s;t. In a Word, if the Removal of the&s;e Per&s;ons from their Po&s;ts has produced &s;uch popular Com|motions, the Continuance of them might have produced &s;omething much more fatal to their King and Countrey, and have brought about that Revolution, which has now been in vain attempted. The Condition of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King would be very poor indeed, &s;hould a Party of his Subjects threaten Him with a Rebellion up|on his bringing Malefactors to Ju&s;tice, or up|on his refu&s;ing to employ tho&s;e whom he dares not tru&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only mention another Argument again&s;t the Puni&s;hment of any of the Rebels, who&s;e Ex|ecutions he repre&s;ents as very &s;hocking to the People, becau&s;e they are their <HI>Countreymen,</HI> (p. 12.) And again, <HI>The Quality of the Sufferers, their Alliances, their Characters, their being</HI> En|gli&s;hmen<HI>, with a thou&s;and other Circum&s;tances, will contribute to breed more ill Blood than all the State-Chirurgeons can po&s;&s;ibly let out,</HI> (p. 12.) The Impeached Lords likewi&s;e, in the la&s;t Paragraph of the Pamphlet, are recommended to our Pity, becau&s;e they are our <HI>Countreymen.</HI> By this way of Rea&s;oning, no Man that is a Gentleman, or born within the three Seas &s;hould be &s;ubject
<PB N="179" REF="188">
to Capital Puni&s;hment. Be&s;ides, who can be guilty of Rebellion that are not our <HI>Countrey|men</HI>? As for the endearing Name of <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> which he be&s;tows upon every one of the Criminals, he &s;hould con&s;ider, that a Man de|&s;ervedly cuts him&s;elf off from the Affections as well as the Privileges of that Community, which he endeavours to &s;ubvert.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;everal Arguments which ap|pear in different Forms and Expre&s;&s;ions thro' this whole Pamphlet, and under which every one that is urged in it may be reduced. There is in|deed another Set of them, derived from the Ex|ample and Authority of Great Per&s;ons, which the Author produces in Favour of his own Scheme. The&s;e are <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Henry</HI> IV^t^h of <HI>France,</HI> our late King <HI>William,</HI> King <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> If a Man were di&s;po&s;ed to draw Arguments for Severity out of Hi&s;tory, how many In&s;tances might one find of it among the greate&s;t Princes of every Nation? But as different Princes may act very laudably by different Methods in different Con|junctures, I cannot think this a conclu&s;ive Way of Rea&s;oning. However, let us examine this Set of Arguments, and we &s;hall find them no le&s;s defective than tho&s;e abovementioned.</P>
<P><HI>One of the greate&s;t of our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Monarchs,</HI> &s;ays our Author, <HI>was</HI> William the Conqueror<HI>; and he was the greater, becau&s;e he put to Death only one Per&s;on of Quality that we read of, and him af|ter repeated Treacheries; yet he was a Foreigner, had Power &s;ufficient, and did not want Provoca|tions to have been more bloody.</HI> (p. 27.) This Per|&s;on of Quality was the Earl <HI>Waltheof,</HI> who being overtaken with Wine, engaged in a Con&s;pira|cy again&s;t this Monarch, but repenting of it the
<PB N="180" REF="189">
next Morning, repaired to the King who was then in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and di&s;covered the whole Matter. Notwith&s;tanding which, he was beheaded upon the Defeat of the Con&s;piracy for having but thus far tampered in it. And as for the re&s;t of the Con|&s;pirators, who ro&s;e in an actual Rebellion, the King u&s;ed them with the utmo&s;t Rigour, he cut off the Hands of &s;ome, put out the Eyes of others, &s;ome were hanged upon Gibbets, and tho&s;e who fared the be&s;t, were &s;ent into Bani&s;hment. There are indeed, the mo&s;t dreadful Examples of Severity in this Reign: Tho' it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd, that, after the Manner of tho&s;e Times, the Nobility generally e&s;caped with their Lives, tho' Multitudes of them were puni&s;hed with Ba|ni&s;hment, perpetual Impri&s;onment, Forfeitures, and other great Severities: While the poor Peo|ple, who had been deluded by the&s;e their Ring|leaders, were executed with the utmo&s;t Rigour. A Partiality which I believe no Commoner of <HI>Eng|land</HI> will ever think to be either ju&s;t or rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance is <HI>Henry</HI> the IV^t^h of <HI>France, who</HI> (&s;ays our Author) <HI>&s;o hand&s;omely expre&s;&s;ed his Tenderne&s;s for his People, when, at &s;igning the Trea|ty of</HI> Vervins<HI>, he &s;aid, That by one Da&s;h of his Pen he had overcome more Enemies, than he cou'd ever be able to do with his Sword.</HI> Would not an ordinary Reader think that this Treaty of <HI>Vervins</HI> was a Treaty between <HI>Henry</HI> the IV^t^h and a Party of his Subjects? For otherwi&s;e how can it have a Place in the pre&s;ent Argument? But in&s;tead of that it was a Treaty between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>; &s;o that the Speech expre&s;&s;ed an equal Tender|ne&s;s to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI>; as Multitudes of either Nation mu&s;t have fallen in that War, had it continued longer. As for this King's Treatment of Con&s;pirators, (tho' he is quoted
<PB N="181" REF="190">
thrice in the Pamphlet as an Example of Cle|mency) you have an eminent In&s;tance of it in his Behaviour to the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Biron,</HI> who had been his old faithful Servant, and had con|tributed more than any one to his Advancement to the Throne. This Mare&s;chal, upon &s;ome Di&s;content, was enter'd into a Con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t his Ma&s;ter, and refu&s;ing to open the whole Secret to the King, he was &s;ent to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and there beheaded, notwith&s;tanding he &s;ought for Mercy with great Importunities, and in the mo&s;t moving Manner. There are other In&s;tan|ces in this King's Reign, who notwith&s;tanding was remarkabable for his Clemency, of Rebels and Con&s;pirators who were hanged, beheaded, or broken alive on the Wheel.</P>
<P>The late King <HI>William</HI> was not di&s;turbed by any Rebellion from tho&s;e who had once &s;ubmitted to him. But we know he treated the Per&s;ons concerned in the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-Plot as &s;o horrid a Con&s;piracy de&s;erved. As for the Saying which this Author imputes to that Monarch, it being a Piece of &s;ecret Hi&s;tory, one doth not know when it was &s;poken, or what it alluded to, unle&s;s the Author had been more particular in the Account of it.</P>
<P>The Author proceeds in the next Place to no le&s;s an Authority, than that of <HI>Solomon</HI>: <HI>Among all the general Ob&s;ervations of the wi&s;e&s;t Princes we know of, I think there is none holds more uni|ver&s;ally than Mercy and Truth pre&s;erve a King, and his Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed in Mercy.</HI> (p. 18.) If we compare the different Sayings of this wi&s;e King, which relate to the Conduct of Princes, we cannot que&s;tion but that he means by this Mercy, that kind of it, which is con&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on and Government, and by which we
<PB N="182" REF="191">
hope to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty's Throne e&s;tabli&s;hed. But our Author &s;hou'd con&s;ider that the &s;ame wi&s;e Man has &s;aid in another Place, that "An evil Man &s;eeketh Rebellion, therefore a cru|el Me&s;&s;enger &s;hall be &s;ent again&s;t him." Ac|cordingly his Practice was agreeable to his Pro|verb: No Prince having ever given a greater Te&s;timony of his Abhorrence to Undertakings of this trea&s;onable Nature. For he di&s;patched &s;uch a cruel Me&s;&s;enger as is here mentioned to tho&s;e who had been engaged in a Rebellion ma|ny Years before he him&s;elf was on the Throne, and even to his elder Brother, upon the bare Su&s;picion that he was projecting &s;o wicked an Enterprize.</P>
<P>How the Example of the Pretender came into this Argument, I am at a Lo&s;s to find out. <HI>The Pretender declared a general Pardon to All: And &s;hall our rightful King &s;hew him&s;elf le&s;s the true Father of his People, and afford his Pardon to none,</HI> &amp;c. (p. 25.) The Pretender's general Pardon was to a People who were not in his Power; and had he ever reduced them under it, it was only promi&s;ed to &s;uch as immediately join|ed with him for the Recovery of what he called his Right. It was &s;uch a general Pardon as would have been con&s;i&s;tent with the Execution of more than nine Parts in ten of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>There is but one more Hi&s;torical Argument which is drawn from King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Treatment of the <HI>Catalans. I think it would not be un&s;ea&s;on|able for &s;ome Men to recollect what their own Notions were of the Treatment of the</HI> Catalans; <HI>how many Declamations were made on the Barbarity u&s;ed to|wards them by King</HI> Philip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (p. 29.) If the Au|thor remembers the&s;e Declamations, as he calls them were not made &s;o much on the Barbarity
<PB N="183" REF="192">
u&s;ed towards them by King <HI>Philip,</HI> as on the Bar|barity u&s;ed towards them by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Govern|ment. King <HI>Philip</HI> might have &s;ome Colour for treating them as Rebels, but we ought to have re|garded them as Allies; and were obliged by all the Ties of Honour, Con&s;cience, and publick Faith, to have &s;helter'd them from tho&s;e Sufferings, which were brought upon them by a firm and inviolable Adherence to our Intere&s;t. How|ever, none can draw into a Parallel the Cruel|ties which have been inflicted on that unhappy People, with tho&s;e few In&s;tances of Severity which our Government has been obliged to ex|ert towards the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Rebels. I &s;ay no Man would make &s;uch a Parallel, unle&s;s his Mind be &s;o blinded with Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice, as to a&s;&s;ert, in the Language of this Pamphlet, <HI>That no In&s;tances can be produced of the lea&s;t Lenity under the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration from the fir&s;t Hour it commenc'd to this Day,</HI> (p. 20.) with other a|&s;toni&s;hing Reflexions of the &s;ame Nature, which are contradicted by &s;uch innumerable Matters of Fact, that it would be an Affront to a Rea|der's Under&s;tanding to endeavour to confute them.

This is &s;o far from being truly related, that in the beginning of the War, they were executed without Mercy. But when in Conjunction with their Allies, they became Superior to King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Party in Strength, and extended their Conque&s;ts up to the very Gates of <HI>Madrid,</HI> it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Court would be &s;o infatuated as to per&s;i&s;t in their fir&s;t Severities, again&s;t an Enemy that could make &s;uch terrible Reprizals. How|ever,
<PB N="184" REF="193">
when this Rea&s;on of State cea&s;ed, how dreadful was the Havock made among this brave, but unhappy People! The whole Kingdom without any Di&s;tinction to the many Thou&s;ands of its innocent Inhabitants, was &s;tript of its Immunities, and reduced to a State of Slavery. <HI>Barcelona</HI> was filled with Executions; and all the Patriots of their antient Liberties either be|headed, &s;towed in Dungeons, or condemned to work in the Mines of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>God be thanked we have a King who puni&s;hes with Reluctancy, and is aver&s;e to &s;uch Cruel|ties as were us'd among the <HI>Catalans,</HI> as much as to tho&s;e practi&s;ed on the Per&s;ons concern'd in <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion. Our Author indeed, condemns the&s;e <HI>We&s;tern</HI> A&s;&s;izes in King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, (p. 26.) And it would be well if all tho&s;e who &s;till adhere to the Cau&s;e of that unfor|tunate King, and are clamorous at the Proceed|ings of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, would remember, that notwith&s;tanding that Rebellion fell very much &s;hort of this both in the Number and Strength of the Rebels, and had no Tendency either to de&s;troy the National Religion, to in|troduce an Arbitrary Government, or to &s;ub|ject us to a Foreign Power; not only the Chief of the Rebels was beheaded, but even a Lady, who had only harbour'd one of the Offenders in her Hou&s;e was in her extreme old Age put to the &s;ame kind of Death: That about two hundred and thirty were hanged, drawn, and quartered, and their Limbs di&s;per&s;ed through &s;everal Parts of the Countrey, and &s;et up as Spectacles of Terror to their Fellow-Subjects. It would be too tedious a Work to run through the numberle&s;s Fines, Impri&s;onments, Corpo|ral Puni&s;hments, and Tran&s;portations, which
<PB N="185" REF="194">
were then likewi&s;e practi&s;ed as whol&s;ome Se|verities.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een how fallaciou&s;ly the Author has &s;tated the Cau&s;e he has undertaken, by &s;up|po&s;ing that nothing but unlimited Mercy, or unlimited Puni&s;hment, are the Methods that can be made u&s;e of in our pre&s;ent Treatment of the Rebels: That he has omitted the middle way of Proceeding between the&s;e two Extremes: That this middle Way is the Method in which His Maje&s;ty, like all other wi&s;e and good Kings, has cho&s;en to proceed: That it is agreeable to the Nature of Government, Religion, and our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution: And that every Argument which the Author has produced from Rea&s;on and Example, would have been a true one, had it been urged for that re&s;train'd Clemency which His Maje&s;ty has exerci&s;ed: But is a fal&s;e one, when apply'd to &s;uch a general, undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing Mercy as the Author would recom|mend.</P>
<P>Having thus an&s;wered that which is the main Drift and De&s;ign of this Pamphlet, I &s;hall touch upon tho&s;e other Parts of it, which are inter|woven with the Arguments, to put Men out of Humour with the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>And here we may ob&s;erve, that it is our Au|thor's Method to &s;uppo&s;e Matters of Fact which are not in being, and afterwards to de&s;cant upon them. As he is very &s;en&s;ible that the Cau&s;e will not bear the Te&s;t of Rea&s;on, he has indeed every where cho&s;en rather Topicks for Decla|mation than Argument&punc; Thus he entertains us with a laboured Invective again&s;t a &s;tanding Army. But what has this to do in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e? I &s;uppo&s;e he wou'd not advi&s;e his Ma|je&s;ty to disband his Forces while there is an
<PB N="186" REF="195">
Army of Rebels in his Dominions. I can|not imagine he would think the Affections of the People of <HI>England</HI> a Security of the Government in &s;uch a Juncture, were it not at the &s;ame time defended with a &s;ufficient Body of Troops. No Prince has ever gi|ven a greater In&s;tance of his Inclinations to rule without a Standing-Army, if we con&s;ider, that upon the very fir&s;t News of the Defeat of the Rebels, he declared to both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, that he had put an immediate Stop to the Levies which he had begun to rai&s;e at their Re|que&s;t, and that he would not make u&s;e of the Power which they had entru&s;ted him with, un|le&s;s any new Preparations of the Enemy &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for our Defence. This Speech was receiv'd with the greate&s;t Gratitude by both Hou&s;es; and it is &s;aid, that in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons a very can did and honourable Gentleman (who generally votes with the Minority) de|clared, that he had not heard &s;o gracious a Speech from the Throne for many Years la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>In another Place, he &s;uppo&s;es that the Go|vernment has not endeavoured to gain the Ap|plau&s;e of the Vulgar, by doing &s;omething for the Church; and very gravely makes Excu&s;es for this their pretended Neglect. What greater In|&s;tances could His Maje&s;ty have given of his Love to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than tho&s;e he has ex|hibited by his mo&s;t &s;olemn Declarations; by his daily Example; and by his Promotions of the mo&s;t eminent among the Clergy to &s;uch Vacan|cies as have happened in his Reign. To which we mu&s;t add, for the Honour of his Government in this Particular, That it has done more for the Advantage of the Clergy, than tho&s;e, who are the
<PB N="187" REF="196">
mo&s;t zealous for their Intere&s;t, could have ex|pected in &s;o &s;hort a Time; which will farther ap|pear, if we reflect upon the valuable and Royal Donative to one of our Univer&s;ities, and the Provi&s;ion made for tho&s;e who are to officiate in the Fifty New Churches. His Maje&s;ty is, in|deed, a Prince of too much Magnanimity and Truth, to make u&s;e of the Name of the Church for drawing his People into any thing that may be prejudicial to them; for what our Author &s;ays, to this Purpo&s;e, redounds as much to the Honour of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, as to the Di&s;grace of others. <HI>Nay, I wi&s;h with all my Soul they had &s;tooped a little</HI> ad captum vulgi<HI>, to take in tho&s;e &s;hallow fluttering Hearts, which are to be caught by any thing baited with the Name of</HI> Church, <HI>(p.</HI> 11.<HI>)</HI></P>
<P>Again; The Author asks, <HI>Whether Terror is to become the only National Principle</HI>? With other Que&s;tions of the &s;ame Nature: And in &s;everal Parts of his Book, harangues very plentifully again&s;t &s;uch a Notion. Where he talks in Ge|nerals upon this Topick, there is no que&s;tion but every <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> in the Kingdom per|fectly agree with him in what he &s;ays. But if he would in&s;inuate, as he &s;eems to do in &s;eve|ral Places, that there &s;hould be no Impre&s;&s;ions of Awe upon the Mind of a Subject, and that a Government &s;hould not create Terror in tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to do ill, as well as encourage tho&s;e that do their Duty: In &s;hort, if he is for an entire Exclu&s;ion of that Principle of Fear which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome Influence in e|very Law, he oppo&s;es him&s;elf to the Form of every Government in the World, and to the Common Sen&s;e of Mankind.</P>
<P>The Artifice of this Author in &s;tarting Obje|ctions
<PB N="188" REF="197">
to the Friends of the Government, and the fooli&s;h An&s;wers which he &s;uppo&s;es they re|turn to them is &s;o very vi&s;ible, that every one &s;ees they are de&s;igned rather to divert his Rea|der, than to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>I have now examined this whole Pamphlet, which, indeed, is written with a great deal of Art, and as much Argument as the Cau&s;e would bear: And after having &s;tated the true Notion of Clemency, Mercy, Compa&s;&s;ion, Good-nature, Humanity, or whatever el&s;e it may be called, &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with Wi&s;dom, and the Good of Mankind, or, in o|ther Words, &s;o far as it is a moral Virtue, I &s;hall readily concur with the Author in the highe&s;t Panegyricks that he has be&s;towed upon it. As likewi&s;e, I heartily join with him in every thing he has &s;aid again&s;t Ju&s;tice, if it in|cludes, as his Pamphlet &s;uppo&s;es, the Extir|pation of every Criminal, and is not exerci|&s;ed with a much greater Mixture of Clemency than Rigour. Mercy, in the true Sen&s;e of the Word, is that Virtue by which a Prince ap|proaches neare&s;t to Him, whom he repre&s;ents; and whil&s;t he is neither remi&s;s nor extreme to a|nimadvert upon tho&s;e who offend him, that Logick will hold true of him which is ap|ply'd to the Great Judge of all the Earth; <HI>With thee there is Mercy, therefore &s;halt thou be Feared.</HI></P>

<P>I Que&s;tion not but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies are ve|ry well plea&s;ed with the Compliment I have payed them in the Cour&s;e of my Papers, by regarding them, not only as the mo&s;t amia|ble, but as the mo&s;t important Part of our Com|munity. They ought, indeed, to re&s;ent the Treatment they have met with from other Au|thors, who have never troubled their Heads a|bout them, but addre&s;s'd all their Arguments to the Male Half of their Fellow-Subjects; and taken it for granted, that if they could bring the&s;e into their Mea&s;ures, the Females would of Cour&s;e follow their political Mates. The Ar|guments they have made u&s;e of, are like <HI>Hudi|bras</HI>'s Spur, which he apply'd to one Side of his Hor&s;e, as not doubting but the other would keep Pace with it. The&s;e Writers &s;eem to have regarded the Fair Sex but as the Garniture of a Nation; and when they con&s;ider them as Parts of the Commonwealth, it is only as they are of u&s;e to the Con&s;umption of our Manufacture. <HI>Could we per&s;wade our</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Women</HI> (&s;ays one of our eminent Merchants in a Letter to his Friend in the Countrey upon the Subject of Commerce) <HI>to cloath them&s;elves in the comely Ap|parel which might be made out of the Wooll of their own Countrey; and in&s;tead of Coffee, Tea and Cho|colate, to delight in tho&s;e whol&s;ome and palatable</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="199">
<HI>Liquors which may be extracted from our</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Simples; they would be of great Advantage to Trade, and therein to the Publick Weal.</HI></P>
<P>It is now, however, become nece&s;&s;ary to treat our Women as Members of the Body Politick; &s;ince it is vi&s;ible that great Numbers of them have of late eloped from their Allegiance, and that they do not believe them&s;elves obliged to draw with us, as Yoke-Fellows in the Con&s;ti|tution. They will judge for them&s;elves; look into the State of the Nation with their own Eyes; and be no longer led Blindfold by a Male Legi&s;lature. A Friend of mine was lately complaining to me, that his Wife had turned off one of the be&s;t Cook-Maids in <HI>England,</HI> be|cau&s;e the Wench had &s;aid &s;omething to her Fel|low-Servants, which &s;eemed to favour the Su|&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas-Corpus</HI> Act.</P>
<P>When Errors and Prejudices are thus &s;pread among the Sex, it is the harde&s;t thing in the World to root them out. Arguments, which are the only proper Means for it, are of little u&s;e; They have a very &s;hort An&s;wer to all Rea|&s;onings that turn again&s;t them, <HI>Make us believe That, if you can</HI>; which is in <HI>Latin,</HI> if I may upon this occa&s;ion be allowed the Pedantry of a Quotation, <HI>Non per&s;uadebis, etiam&s;i per&s;ua&s;eris.</HI> I could not but &s;mile at a young Univer&s;ity Di&s;|putant, who was complaining the other Day of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of a Lady with whom he was engaged in a Point of Controver&s;y. Being left alone with her, he took the opportunity of pur&s;uing an Argument which had been before &s;tarted in Di&s;cour&s;e, and put it to her in a Syl|logi&s;m: Upon which, as he informed us with &s;ome Heat, &s;he granted him him both the Ma|jor
<PB N="191" REF="200">
and the Minor, but deny'd him the Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Method, therefore, that can be made u&s;e of with the&s;e polemical Ladies, who are much more ea&s;y to be Refuted than Silenced, is to &s;hew them the ridiculous Side of their Cau&s;e, and to make them laugh at their own Politicks. It is a kind of ill Manners to offer Objections to a fine Woman; and a Man would be out of Countenance that &s;hould gain the Su|periority in &s;uch a Conte&s;t. A Coquette Lo|gician may be railly'd but not contradicted. Tho&s;e who would make u&s;e of &s;olid Argu|ments and &s;trong Rea&s;onings to a Reader or Hearer of &s;o delicate a Turn, would be like that fooli&s;h People whom <HI>Aelian</HI> &s;peaks of, that wor&s;hipped a Fly, and &s;acrificed an Ox to it.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, a Man mu&s;t be of a very di&s;putatious Temper, that enters into State-Controver&s;ies with any of the fair Sex. If the Malignant be not Beautiful, &s;he cannot do much Mi&s;chief; and if &s;he is, her Arguments will be &s;o enforced by the Charms of her Per&s;on, that her Antagoni&s;t may be in danger of betraying his own Cau&s;e. <HI>Milton</HI> puts this Confe&s;&s;ion into the Mouth of our Father <HI>Adam</HI>; who tho' he a&s;&s;erts his Superiority of Rea&s;on in his De|bates with the Mother of Mankind, adds,<Q><L>&mdash;Yet when I approach</L>

<P><PB N="192" REF="201">
If there is &s;uch a native Loveline&s;s in the Sex, as to make them Victorious even when they are in the wrong, how re&s;i&s;tle&s;s is their Pow|er when they are on the Side of Truth! And indeed, it is a peculiar good Fortune to the Government, that our Fair Malecontents are &s;o much over-matched in Beauty, as well as Number, by tho&s;e who are Loyal to their King, and Friends to their Countrey.</P>
<P>Every Paper, which I have hitherto addre&s;s'd to our beautiful Incendiaries, hath been filled with Con&s;iderations of a different Kind; by which Means I have taken Care that tho&s;e, who are Enemies to the Sex, or to my &s;elf, may not accu&s;e me of Tautology, or pretend that I at|tack them with their own Weapon. For this Rea&s;on I &s;hall here lay together a new Set of Re|marks, and ob&s;erve the &s;everal Artifices by which the Enemies to our E&s;tabli&s;hment do rai&s;e &s;uch unaccountable Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices in the Minds of our di&s;contented Females.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place; it is u&s;ual among the mo&s;t Cunning of our Adver&s;aries, to repre&s;ent all the Rebels as very hand&s;ome Men. If the Name of a Traitor be mentioned, they are very par|ticular in de&s;cribing his Per&s;on; and when they are not able to extenuate his Trea&s;on, commend his Shape. This has &s;o good an Effect in one of our Female Audiences, that they repre&s;ent to them&s;elves a thou&s;and poor, tall, innocent, fre&s;h-coloured young Gentlemen, who are di|&s;pers'd among the &s;everal Pri&s;ons of <HI>Great Bre|tain</HI>; and extend their generous Compa&s;&s;ion to|wards a Multitude of agreeable Fellows that never were in being.</P>
<P>Another Artifice is, to in&s;till Jealou&s;ies into their Minds of De&s;igns upon the Anvil to re|trench
<PB N="193" REF="202">
the Privileges of the Sex. Some repre|&s;ent the <HI>Whigs</HI> as Enemies to <HI>Flanders-</HI>Lace: Others had &s;pread a Report that in the late Act of Parliament for four Shillings in the Pound upon Land, there would be in&s;erted a Clau&s;e for rai&s;ing a Tax upon Pin-Money. That the Ladies may be the better upon their Guard a|gain&s;t Sugge&s;tions of this Nature, I &s;hall beg Leave to put them in mind of the Story of <HI>Pa|pirius,</HI> the Son of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator. This young Gentleman, after having been pre&s;ent in publick Debates, was u&s;ually teazed by his Mother to inform her of what had pa&s;&s;ed. In order to de|liver him&s;elf from this Importunity, he told her one Day, upon his Return from the Senate-Hou&s;e, that there had been a Motion made for a Decree to allow every Man two Wives. The good Lady &s;aid nothing; but managed Matters &s;o well among the <HI>Roman</HI> Matrons, that the next Day they met together in a Body before the Senate-Hou&s;e, and pre&s;ented a Petition to the Fathers again&s;t &s;o unrea&s;onable a Law. This groundle&s;s Credulity rai&s;ed &s;o much Raillery up|on the Petitioners, that we do not find the La|dies offer'd to direct the Law-givers of their Countrey ever after.</P>
<P>There has been another Method lately made u&s;e of, which has been practi&s;ed with extraor|dinary Succe&s;s; I mean the &s;preading abroad Reports of Prodigies, which has wonderfully gratified the Curio&s;ity, as well as the Hopes of our fair Malignants. Their Managers turn Water into Blood for them; frighten them with Sea-Mon&s;ters; make them &s;ee Armies in the Air; and give them their Word, the more to ingratiate them&s;elves with them, that they &s;ig|nify nothing le&s;s than future Slaughter and De|&s;olation.
<PB N="194" REF="203">
The di&s;loyal Part of the Sex imme|diately hug them&s;elves at the News of the Bloody Fountain; look upon the&s;e Fi&s;h as their Friends; have great Expectations from the Clouds; and are very angry with you, if you think they do not All portend Ruine to their Countrey.</P>
<P>Secret Hi&s;tory and Scandal have always had their Allurements; and I have in other Di&s;|cour&s;es &s;hewn the great Advantage that is made of them in the pre&s;ent Ferment among the fair Ones.</P>
<P>But the Ma&s;ter Engine, to overturn the Minds of the Female World, is the <HI>Danger of the Church.</HI> I am not &s;o uncharitable as to think there is any thing in an Ob&s;ervation made by &s;everal of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> that there is &s;carce a Woman in <HI>England</HI> who is troubled with the Vapours, but is more or le&s;s affected with this Cry: Or, to remark with others, that it is not utter'd in any part of the Nation with &s;o much Bitterne&s;s of Tongue and Heart, as in the Di&s;tricts of <HI>Drury-lane.</HI> On the contra|ry, I believe there are many devout and honou|rable Women who are deluded in this Point by the Artifice of de&s;igning Men. To the&s;e, therefore, I would apply my &s;elf, in a more &s;e|rious Manner, and de&s;ire them to con&s;ider how that laudable Piety, which is natural to the Sex, is apt to degenerate into a groundle&s;s and furi|ous Zeal, when it is not kept within the Bounds of Charity and Rea&s;on. Female Zeal, though proceeding from &s;o good a Principle, has been infinitely detrimental to Society, and to Reli|gion it&s;elf. If we may believe the <HI>French</HI> Hi|&s;torians, it often put a Stop to the Proceedings of their Kings, which might have ended in a
<PB N="195" REF="204">
Reformation. For, upon their breaking with the Pope, the Queens frequently interpo&s;ed, and by their Importunities, reconciled them to the U&s;urpations of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nay, it was this vicious Zeal which gave a remarka|ble Check to the fir&s;t Progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity, as we find it recorded by a &s;acred Hi&s;torian in the following Pa&s;&s;age, which I &s;hall leave to the Con&s;ideration of my Female Readers. <HI>But the</HI> Jews <HI>&s;tirred up the devout and honourable Women and the chief Men of the City, and rai&s;ed a Per&s;e|cution again&s;t</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas<HI>, and expelled them out of their Coa&s;ts.</HI></P>

<P>WE find by our publick Papers, the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Dublin</HI> have lately pre&s;ented to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in a mo&s;t humble and du|tiful Manner, their Diploma for con&s;tituting His Royal Highne&s;s Chancellor of that Learned Body; and that the Prince received this their Offer with the Goodne&s;s and Conde&s;cen&s;ion which is natural to his illu&s;trious Hou&s;e. As the College of <HI>Dublin</HI> have been long famous for their great Learning, they have now given us an In&s;tance of their Good Sen&s;e; and it is
<PB N="196" REF="205">
with Plea&s;ure that we find &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;i|tion in this famous Nur&s;ery of Letters to pro|pagate &s;ound Principles, and to act, in its proper Sphere, for the Honour and Dignity of the Roy|al Family. We hope that &s;uch an Example will have its Influence on other Societies of the &s;ame Nature; and cannot but rejoice to &s;ee the Heir of <HI>Great Britain</HI> vouch&s;afing to Patronize in &s;o peculiar a Manner that Noble Seminary, which is perhaps at this Time training up &s;uch Per&s;ons as may hereafter be Ornaments to his Reign.</P>
<P>When Men of Learning are acted thus by a Knowledge of the World as well as of Books, and &s;hew that their Studies naturally in&s;pire them with a Love to their King and Countrey; they give a Reputation to Literature, and con|vince the World of its U&s;efulne&s;s. But when Arts and Sciences are &s;o perverted as to di&s;po&s;e Men to act in Contradiction to the re&s;t of the Community, and to &s;et up for a kind of &s;epa|rate Republick among them&s;elves, they draw upon them the Indignation of the Wi&s;e, and the Contempt of the Ignorant.</P>
<P>It has indeed, been ob&s;erved, that Per&s;ons, who are very much e&s;teemed for their Know|ledge and Ingenuity in their private Characters, have acted like Strangers to Mankind, and to the Dictates of right rea&s;on, when joined to|gether in a Body. Like &s;everal Chymical Wa|ters, that are each of them clear and tran&s;parent when &s;eparate, but ferment into a thick trou|bled Liquor when they are mixed in the &s;ame Vial.</P>
<P>There is a Piece of Mythology which bears ve|ry hard upon Learned Men; and which I &s;hall here relate, rather for the Delicacy of the Sa|tyr,
<PB N="197" REF="206">
than for the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Moral. When the City of <HI>Athens</HI> was fini&s;hed, we are told that <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> pre&s;ented them&s;elves as Candidates for the Guardian&s;hip of the Place. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> after a full Debate upon the Mat|ter, came to an Election, and made choice of <HI>Minerva.</HI> Upon which, <HI>Neptune,</HI> who very much re&s;ented the Indignity, upbraided them with their Stupidity and Ignorance; that a Maritime Town &s;hould reject the Patronage of him who was the God of the Seas, and could defend them again&s;t all the Attacks of their Enemies. He concluded with a Cur&s;e upon the Inhabi|tants, which was to &s;tick to them and their Po|&s;terity; namely, <HI>That they &s;hould be all Fools.</HI> When <HI>Minerva</HI> their Tutelary Godde&s;s, who pre&s;ides over Arts and Sciences, came among them to receive the Honour they had conferr'd upon her, they made heavy Complaints of the Cur&s;e which <HI>Neptune</HI> had laid upon the City; and begg'd her, if po&s;&s;ible, to take it off. But &s;he told them it was not in her Power; for that one Deity could not rever&s;e the Act of ano|ther. <HI>However,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I may alleviate the Cur&s;e which I cannot remove: It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to hinder you from being Fools, but I will take care that you &s;hall be Learned.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing which Bodies of Learned Men &s;hould be more careful of, than, by all due Me|thods, to cultivate the Favour of the Great and Powerful. The Indulgence of a Prince is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the Propagation, the Defence, the Honour and Support of Learning. It naturally creates in Men's Minds an Ambition to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by Letters; and multiplies the Number of tho&s;e who are dedicated to the Pur|&s;uits of Knowledge. It protects them again&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="207">
the Violence of Brutal Men; and gives them Opportunities to pur&s;ue their Studies in a State of Peace and Tranquillity. It puts the Learn|ed in Countenance; and gives them a Place among the fa&s;hionable Part of Mankind. It di|&s;tributes Rewards; and encourages Speculative Per&s;ons, who have neither Opportunity nor a Turn of Mind to increa&s;e their own Fortunes, with all the Incentives of Place, Profit and Pre|ferment. On the contrary, nothing is in it&s;elf &s;o pernicious to Communities of Learned Men, nor more apprehended by tho&s;e that wi&s;h them well, than the Di&s;plea&s;ure of their Prince, which tho&s;e may ju&s;tly expect to feel, who would make u&s;e of his Favour to his own Prejudice, and put in Practice all the Methods that lye within their Power to vilify his Per&s;on, and di&s;tre&s;s his Go|vernment. In both the&s;e Ca&s;es, a Learned Bo|dy is in a more particular Manner expo&s;ed to the Influence of their King, as de&s;cribed by the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, <HI>The Wrath of a King is as the Roaring of a Lion; but his Favour is as the Dew upon the Gra&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>We find in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories, that the Empre&s;s <HI>Matilda,</HI> (who was the great Ance&s;tor of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and who&s;e Grand-daugh|ter of the &s;ame name has a Place upon &s;everal of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Medals) was particularly favoured by the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and defended in that Place, when mo&s;t Parts of the Kingdom had re|volted again&s;t her. Nor is it to be que&s;tioned, but an Univer&s;ity &s;o famous for Learning and &s;ound Knowledge, will &s;hew the &s;ame Zeal for her il|lu&s;trious De&s;cendent, as they will every Day di&s;cern His Maje&s;ty's Royal Virtues, through tho&s;e Prejudices which have been rai&s;ed in their Minds by artful and de&s;igning Men. It is
<PB N="199" REF="208">
with much Plea&s;ure we &s;ee this great Foun|tain of Learning already beginning to run clear, and recovering its Natural Purity and Brightne&s;s. None can imagine that a Community which is taxed by the wor&s;t of its Enemies, only for over|&s;training the Notions of Loyalty even to bad Princes, will fall &s;hort of a due Allegiance to the be&s;t.</P>
<P>When this happy Temper of Mind is fully e|&s;tabli&s;hed among them, we may ju&s;tly hope to &s;ee the large&s;t Share of His Maje&s;ty's Favours fall upon that Univer&s;ity, which is the Greate&s;t, and upon all Accounts the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable not only in his Dominions, but in all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Paper with a Quotation out of <HI>Cambden</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who, after having de&s;cribed that Queen's Re|ception at <HI>Oxford,</HI> gives an Account of the Speech which &s;he made to them at her Depar|ture; concluding with a Piece of Advice to that Univer&s;ity. Her Coun&s;el was, <HI>That they would fir&s;t &s;erve God, not after the Curio&s;ity of &s;ome, but according to the Laws of God and the Land, that they would not go before the Laws, but follow them; nor di&s;pute whether better might be pre&s;cribed, but keep tho&s;e pre&s;cribed already; obey their Superiors; and la&s;tly embrace one another in Brotherly Piety and Concord.</HI></P>

<P>IT is very ju&s;tly, as well as frequently ob&s;er|ved, that if our Nation be ever ruined, it mu&s;t be by it&s;elf. The Parties and Divi&s;ions which reign among us may &s;everal Ways bring De&s;truction upon our Countrey, at the &s;ame Time that our united Force would be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure us again&s;t all the Attempts of a fo|reign Enemy. Whatever Expedients therefore can be found to allay tho&s;e Heats and Animo&s;i|ties, which break us into different Factions and Intere&s;ts, cannot but be u&s;eful to the Publick, and highly tend to its Safety, Strength, and Re|putation.</P>
<P>This dangerous Di&s;&s;ention among us di&s;co|vers it&s;elf in all the mo&s;t indifferent Circum|&s;tances of Life. We keep it up, and cheri&s;h it with as much Pains, as if it were a kind of National Ble&s;&s;ing. It in&s;inuates it&s;elf into all our Di&s;cour&s;es, mixes in our Parties of Plea|&s;ure, has a Share in our Diver&s;ions, and is an Ingredient in mo&s;t of our publick Entertain|ments.</P>
<P>I was not long ago at the Play call'd Sir <HI>Courtly Nice,</HI> where to the eternal Reproach of good Sen&s;e, I found the whole Audience had very gravely ranged them&s;elves into two Parties, un|der <HI>Hot-head</HI> and <HI>Te&s;timony. Hot-head</HI> was the applauded Hero of the <HI>Tories,</HI> and <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> no
<PB N="201" REF="210">
le&s;s the Favourite of the <HI>Whigs.</HI> Each Party followed their Champion. It was wonderful to &s;ee &s;o polite an A&s;&s;embly di&s;tingui&s;hing them|&s;elves by &s;uch extraordinary Repre&s;entatives, and avowing their Principles as conformable either to the Zeal of <HI>Hot-head,</HI> or the Modera|tion of <HI>Te&s;timony.</HI> Thus the two Parts which were de&s;igned to expo&s;e the Faults of both Sides, and were accordingly received by our Ance&s;tors in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, meet with a kind of Sanction from the Applau&s;es which are re&s;pectively be&s;towed on them by their wi&s;e Po&s;terity. We &s;eem to imagine that they were written as Patterns for Imitation, not as Objects of Ridicule.</P>
<P>This Humour runs &s;o far, that mo&s;t of our late Comedies owe their Succe&s;s to it. The Audience li&s;tens after nothing el&s;e. I have &s;een little <HI>Dicky</HI> place him&s;elf with great Approba|tion at the Head of the <HI>Tories</HI> for five Acts to|gether, and <HI>Pinky</HI> e&s;pou&s;e the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Whigs</HI> with no le&s;s Succe&s;s. I do not find that either Party has yet thrown them&s;elves under the Patronage of Scaramouch, or that Harle|quin has violated that Neutrality, which, upon his late Arrival in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> he profe&s;&s;ed to both Parties, and which it is thought he will punctually ob&s;erve, being allowed on all Sides to be a Man of Honour. It is true, that upon his fir&s;t Appearance, a violent <HI>Whig</HI> Trade&s;man in the Pit begun to compliment him with a Clap, as overjoyed to &s;ee him mount a Lad|der, and fancying Him to be dre&s;t in a Highland Plad.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but my Readers will be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find me animadverting on a Practice that has been always favourable to the Cau&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="211">
which now prevails. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Theatre was <HI>Whig</HI> even in the wor&s;t of Times; and in the la&s;t Reign did not &s;cruple to te&s;tify its Zeal for the Good of our Countrey, by many magnanimous Claps in its lower Regions, an&s;wered with loud Huzzas from the upper Gallery. This good Di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o much heightened of late, that the whole Neighbourhood of the <HI>Drury-lane</HI> The|ater very often &s;hakes with the Loyalty of the Audience. It is &s;aid, that a young Author, who very much relies on this prevailing Hu|mour, is now writing a Farce to be called <HI>A Match out of Newgate,</HI> in Allu&s;ion to the Title of a Comedy called <HI>A Match in Newgate</HI>; and that his chief Per&s;on is <HI>a round-&s;houlder'd Man with a pretty large No&s;e and a wide Mouth,</HI> making his Addre&s;&s;es to a lovely black Woman that pa&s;&s;es for a Peere&s;s of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> In &s;hort, the whole Play is built upon the late E|&s;cape of General <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> who is &s;uppo&s;ed upon the Road to fall in Love with my Lord <HI>Nithi&s;|dale,</HI> whom the Ingenious Author imagines to be &s;till in his Riding-Hood.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the good Principles of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Audience in this one Particular, it were to be wi&s;hed that every thing &s;hould be bani&s;h|ed the Stage which has a Tendency to exa&s;pe|rate Men's Minds, and enflame that Party Rage which makes us &s;uch a mi&s;erable and divided Peo|ple. And that in the fir&s;t Place, becau&s;e &s;uch a Proceeding as this di&s;appoints the very De|&s;ign of all publick Diver&s;ions and Entertain|ments. The In&s;titution of Sports and Shews was intended by all Governments, to turn off the Thoughts of the People from bu&s;ying them&s;elves in Matters of State, which did not belong to them; to reconcile them to one another by the
<PB N="203" REF="212">
common Participations of Mirth and Plea&s;ure; and to wear out of their Minds that Rancour which they might have contracted by the interfe|ring Views of Intere&s;t and Ambition. It would therefore be for the Benefit of every Society, that is di&s;turbed by contending Factions, to en|courage &s;uch innocent Amu&s;ements as may thus di&s;embitter the Minds of Men, and make them mutually rejoice in the &s;ame agreeable Satisfa|ctions. When People are accu&s;tomed to &s;it to|gether with Plea&s;ure, it is a Step towards Re|conciliation: But as we manage Matters, our polite&s;t A&s;&s;emblies are like boi&s;terous Clubs, that meet over a Gla&s;s of Wine, and before they have done, throw Bottles at one another's Heads. In&s;tead of multiplying tho&s;e de&s;irable Oppor|tunities where we may agree in Points that are indifferent, we let the Spirit of Contention in|to tho&s;e very Methods that are not only foreign to it, but &s;hould in their Nature di&s;po&s;e us to be Friends. This our Anger in our Mirth is like Poi&s;on in a Perfume, which taints the Spi|rits in&s;tead of chearing and refre&s;hing them.</P>
<P>Another manife&s;t Inconvenience which ari&s;es from this Abu&s;e of publick Entertainments, is, that it naturally de&s;troys the Ta&s;te of an Audi|ence. I do not deny, but that &s;everal Perfor|mances have been ju&s;tly applauded for their Wit, which have been written with an Eye to this pre|dominant Humour of the Town: But it is vi|&s;ible even in the&s;e, that it is not the Excellence, but the Application of the Sentiment, that has rai&s;ed Applau&s;e. An Author is very much di&s;|appointed to find the be&s;t Parts of his Producti|ons received with Indifference, and to &s;ee the Audience di&s;covering Beauties which he never intended. The Actors, in the mid&s;t of an in|nocent
<PB N="204" REF="213">
old Play, are often &s;tartled with unex|pected Claps or Hi&s;&s;es; and do not know whe|ther they have been talking like good Subjects, or have &s;poken Trea&s;on. In &s;hort, we &s;eem to have &s;uch a Reli&s;h for Faction, as to have lo&s;t that of Wit; and are &s;o u&s;ed to the Bit|terne&s;s of Party Rage, that we cannot be grati|fied with the highe&s;t Entertainment that has not this kind of Sea&s;oning in it. But as no Work mu&s;t expect to live long, which draws all its Beauty from the Colour of the Times; &s;o nei|ther can that Plea&s;ure be of greater Continuance, which ari&s;es from the Prejudice or Malice of its Hearers.</P>
<P>To conclude; Since the pre&s;ent Hatred and Violence of Parties is &s;o un&s;peakably pernicious to the Community, and none can do a Better Service to their Countrey than tho&s;e who u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to extingui&s;h it, we may rea&s;onably hope, that the more elegant Part of the Nation will give a good Example to the re&s;t; and put an end to &s;o ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h a Practice, which makes our mo&s;t re|fined Diver&s;ions detrimental to the Publick, and, in a particular Manner de&s;tructive of all Politene&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>GRATIAN,</HI> among his Maxims for rai&s;ing a Man to the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Character of Greatne&s;s, advi&s;es fir&s;t to perform extraor|dinary Actions, and in the next Place to &s;ecure a good Hi&s;torian. Without the la&s;t, he con&s;i|ders the fir&s;t as thrown away; as indeed they are in a great Mea&s;ure by &s;uch illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons, as make Fame and Reputation the End of their Undertakings. The mo&s;t &s;hining Me|rit goes down to Po&s;terity with Di&s;advantage, when it is not placed by Writers in its proper Light.</P>
<P>The Misfortune is, that there are more In|&s;tances of Men who de&s;erve this kind of Im|mortality, than of Authors who are able to be|&s;tow it. Our Countrey, which has produced Writers of the fir&s;t Figure in every other kind of Work, has been very barren in good Hi&s;to|rians. We have had &s;everal who have been able to compile Matters of Fact, but very few who have been able to dige&s;t them with that Purity and Elegance of Style, that Nicety and
<PB N="206" REF="215">
Strength of Reflection, that Subtilty and Di&s;|cernment in the Unravelling of a Character, and that Choice of Circum&s;tances for enliven|ing the whole Narration, which we &s;o ju&s;tly admire in the antient Hi&s;torians of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> and in &s;ome Authors of our neighbouring Nations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have &s;ucceeded be&s;t in Works of this kind, are &s;uch, who, be&s;ides their natural good Sen&s;e and Learning, have them&s;elves been ver|&s;ed in publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and thereby acquired a thorough Knowledge of Men and Things. It was the Advice of the great Duke of <HI>Schom|berg,</HI> to an eminent Hi&s;torian of his Acquain|tance, who was an <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tick,</HI> That he &s;hould avoid being too particular in the drawing up of an Army, and other Circum&s;tances of the Day of Battel; for that he had always ob&s;erved mo&s;t notorious Blunders and Ab&s;urdities committed on that Occa&s;ion, by &s;uch Writers as were not conver&s;ant in the Art of War. We may rea|&s;onably expect the like Mi&s;takes in every other kind of Publick Matters, recorded by tho&s;e who have only a di&s;tant Theory of &s;uch Af|fairs. Be&s;ides; it is not very probable, that Men, who have pa&s;&s;ed all their Time in low and vulgar Life, &s;hould have a &s;uitable Idea of the &s;everal Beauties and Blemi&s;hes in the Acti|ons or Characters of Great Men. For this Rea&s;on I find an old Law quoted by the famous Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Bayle</HI> that no Per&s;on below the Dignity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Knight &s;hould pre&s;ume to write an Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> there is &s;carce any one, who has had a Tincture of Reading or Study, that is not apt to fancy him&s;elf equal to &s;o great a Task; tho' it is plain, that many of our Countrey|men,
<PB N="207" REF="216">
who have tampered in Hi&s;tory, frequently &s;hew, that they do not under&s;tand the very Na|ture of tho&s;e Tran&s;actions which they recount. Nay, nothing is more u&s;ual than to &s;ee every Man, who is ver&s;ed in any particular Way of Bu&s;ine&s;s, finding fault with &s;everal of the&s;e Au|thors, &s;o far as they treat of Matters within his Sphere.</P>
<P>There is a Race of Men lately &s;prung up among this &s;ort of Writers, whom one cannot reflect upon without Indignation as well as Con|tempt. The&s;e are our <HI>Grub-Street</HI> Biographers, who watch for the Death of a great Man, like &s;o many Undertakers, on purpo&s;e to make a Penny of him. He is no &s;ooner laid in his Grave, but he falls into the Hands of an Hi&s;to|rian; who, to &s;well a Volume, a&s;cribes to him Works which he never wrote, and Actions which he never performed; celebrates Virtues which he was never famous for, and excu&s;es Faults which he was never guilty of. They fetch their only authentick Records out of <HI>Do|ctors Commons</HI>; and when they have got a Copy of his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament, they fancy them|&s;elves furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient Materials for his Hi&s;tory. This might indeed enable them in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to write the Hi&s;tory of his Death; but what can we expect from an Author that undertakes to write the Life of a Great Man, who is furni&s;hed with no other Matters of Fact, be&s;ides Legacies; and in&s;tead of being able to tell us what he did, can only tell us what he bequeathed? This manner of expo&s;ing the pri|vate Concerns of Families, and &s;acrificing the Secrets of the Dead to the Curio&s;ity of the Li|ving, is one of tho&s;e licentious Practices which might well de&s;erve the Animadver&s;ion of our
<PB N="208" REF="217">
Government, when it has Time to contrive Expedients for remedying the many crying A|bu&s;es of the Pre&s;s. In the mean while, what a poor Idea mu&s;t Strangers conceive of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who have been famous among us in their Generation, &s;hould they form their No|tions of them from the Writings of the&s;e our Hi&s;toriographers! What would our Po&s;terity think of their illu&s;trious Forefathers, &s;hould they only &s;ee them in &s;uch weak and di&s;advan|tageous Lights! But to our Comfort, Works of this Nature are &s;o &s;hort-lived, that they can|not po&s;&s;ibly dimini&s;h the Memory of tho&s;e Pa|triots which they are not able to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, as the Lives of Great Men cannot be written with any tolerable Degree of Elegance or Exactne&s;s, within a &s;hort Space after their Decea&s;e; &s;o neither is it fit that the Hi&s;tory of a Per&s;on, who has acted among us in a publick Character, &s;hould appear, till Envy and Friend&s;hip are laid a&s;leep, and the Prejudice both of his Antagoni&s;ts and Adherents be, in &s;ome Degree, &s;oftned and &s;ubdued. There is no que&s;tion but there are &s;everal eminent Per|&s;ons in each Party, however they may repre&s;ent one another at pre&s;ent, who will have the &s;ame Admirers among Po&s;terity, and be equally cele|brated by tho&s;e, who&s;e Minds will not be di&s;|tempered by Intere&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ion, or Partiality. It were happy for us, could we prevail upon our &s;elves to imagine, that one, who differs from us in Opinion, may po&s;&s;ibly be an hone&s;t Man; and that we might do the &s;ame Ju&s;tice to one another, which will be done us hereafter by tho&s;e who &s;hall make their Appearance in the World, when this Generation is no more.

<P>AMONG all the Paradoxes in Politicks which have been advanced by &s;ome among us, there is none &s;o ab&s;urd and &s;hocking to the mo&s;t ordinary Under&s;tanding, as that it is po&s;|&s;ible for <HI>Great Britain</HI> to be quietly governed by a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Sovereign. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth found it impracticable for a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> to reign even in <HI>France,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Reformed Religion does not engage a Prince to the Per&s;e|cution of any other; and notwith&s;tanding the Authority of the Sovereign in that Countrey is more able to &s;upport it &s;elf, and command the Obedience of the People, than in any other <HI>European</HI> Monarchy. We are convinced by the Experience of our own Times, that our Con|&s;titution is not able to bear a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Prince at the Head of it. King <HI>James</HI> the Second was endowed with many Royal Virtues, and might have made a Nation of <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> happy
<PB N="210" REF="219">
under his Admini&s;tration. The Grievances we &s;uffered in his Reign proceeded purely from his Religion: But they were &s;uch as made the whole Body of the Nobility, Clergy, and Commonal|ty, ri&s;e up as one Man again&s;t him, and oblige him to quit the Throne of his Ance&s;tors. The Truth of it is, we have only the Vices of a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Prince to fear, and may be made happy by his Virtues: But in a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Prince we have no Chance for our Pro&s;perity; his very Piety obliges him to our De&s;truction; and in Pro|portion as he is more Religious, he becomes more In&s;upportable. One would wonder, therefore, to find many who call them&s;elves <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> favouring the Preten&s;ions of a Per|&s;on who has been bred up in the utmo&s;t Bitter|ne&s;s and Bigotry of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>; and who, in all Probability, within le&s;s than a Twelve-month, would be oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e very Men that are indu&s;trious to &s;et him upon the Throne, were it po&s;&s;ible for &s;o wicked and unnatural an Attempt to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I was &s;ome Months ago in a Company, that diverted them&s;elves with the Declaration which he had then publi&s;hed, and particularly with the Date of it, <HI>In the Fourteenth Year of our Reign.</HI> The Company was &s;urprized to find there was a King in <HI>Europe</HI> who had Reigned &s;o long and made &s;uch a Secret of it.

He then proceeded to name the Pre&s;ident of his Council, his Se|cretaries of State, and gave away a very honou|rable Sine-cure to his principal Favourite, by con&s;tituting him his Lord-High-Trea&s;urer.

<P>IT is a melancholy Reflection, that our Coun|trey, which in times of Popery was called the Nation of Saints, &s;hould now have le&s;s ap|pearance of Religion in it, than any other neigh|bouring State or Kingdom; whether they be &s;uch as continue &s;till immer&s;ed in the Errors of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or &s;uch as are recovered out of them. This is a Truth that is obvious to e|very one, who has been conver&s;ant in foreign Parts. It was formerly thought dangerous for a young Man to Travel, le&s;t he &s;hould return an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> to his native Countrey: But at pre|&s;ent it is certain, that an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who has any tolerable Degree of Reflection, cannot be better awakened to a Sen&s;e of Religion in ge|neral, than by ob&s;erving how the Minds of all Mankind are &s;et upon this important Point; how every Nation is &s;erious and attentive to the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Being; and that in o|ther Countries a Man is not out of the Fa&s;hion,
<PB N="215" REF="224">
who is bold and open in the Profe&s;&s;ion and Pra|ctice of all Chri&s;tian Duties.</P>
<P>This Decay of Piety is by no Means to be imputed to the <HI>Reformation,</HI> which in its fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment produced its proper Fruits, and di&s;tingui&s;hed the whole Age with &s;hining In|&s;tances of Virtue and Morality. If we would trace out the Original of that flagrant and a|vowed Impiety, which has prevailed among us for &s;ome Years, we &s;hould find that it owes its Ri&s;e to that oppo&s;ite Extream of <HI>Cant</HI> and <HI>Hy|pocri&s;ie,</HI> which had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Peo|ple's Minds in the Times of the great Rebelli|on, and of the U&s;urpation that &s;ucceeded it. The Practices of the&s;e Men, under the Covert of a feigned Zeal, made even the Appearances of &s;incere Devotion ridiculous and unpopular. The Raillery of the Wits and Courtiers, in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, upon every thing which they then called Preci&s;e, was car|ried to &s;o great an Extravagance, that it almo&s;t put Chri&s;tianity out of Countenance. The Ri|dicule grew &s;o &s;trong and licentious, that from this time we may date that remarkable Turn in the Behaviour of our fa&s;hionable <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that makes them Shame-faced in the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Duties which they were &s;ent into the World to perform.</P>
<P>The late Cry of the <HI>Church</HI> has been an Arti|fice of the &s;ame Kind with that made u&s;e of by the Hypocrites of the la&s;t Age, and has had as fatal an Influence upon Religion. If a Man would but &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider how much greater Comfort he would receive in the la&s;t Moments of his Life from a Reflection that he has made one virtuous Man, than that he has made a thou|&s;and <HI>Tories,</HI> we &s;hould not &s;ee the Zeal of &s;o
<PB N="216" REF="225">
many Good Men turned off from its proper End, and employed in making &s;uch a kind of Converts. What Satisfaction will it be to an Immoral Man, at &s;uch a Time, to think he is a good <HI>Whig</HI>! Or to one that is con&s;cious of Sedition, Perjury, or Rebellion, that he dies with the Reputation of a <HI>High-Churchman</HI>!</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider how this Cry of the <HI>Church</HI> has corrupted the Morals of both Parties. Tho&s;e, who are the loude&s;t in it, regard them&s;elves ra|ther as a political, than a religious Communi|on; and are held together rather by State-Noti|ons, than by Articles of Faith. This fills the Minds of weak Men, who fall into the Snare, with groundle&s;s Fears and Apprehen&s;ions, un|&s;peakable Rage towards their Fellow Subjects, wrong Ideas of Per&s;ons whom they are not ac|quainted with, and uncharitable Interpretations of tho&s;e Actions of which they are not compe|tent Judges. It in&s;tills into their Minds the ut|mo&s;t Virulence and Bitterne&s;s, in&s;tead of that Charity, which is the Perfection and Ornament of Religion, and the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able and ne|ce&s;&s;ary Means for attaining the End of it. In a Word, among the&s;e mi&s;taken Zealots, it &s;an|ctifies Cruelty and Inju&s;tice, Riots and Trea|&s;on.</P>
<P>The Effects which this Cry of the <HI>Church</HI> has had on the other Party, are no le&s;s manife&s;t and deplorable. They &s;ee them&s;elves unju&s;tly a&s;|per&s;ed by it, and vindicate them&s;elves in Terms no le&s;s opprobrious, than tho&s;e by which they are attacked. Their Indignation and Re&s;ent|ment ri&s;es in Proportion to the Malice of their Adver&s;aries. The unthinking Part of them are apt to contract an unrea&s;onable Aver&s;ion even to that Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution to which they
<PB N="217" REF="226">
are repre&s;ented as Enemies; and not only to particular Per&s;ons, but to that Order of Men in general, which will be always held Sacred and Honourable, &s;o long as there is Rea&s;on and Religion in the World.</P>
<P>I might mention many other Corruptions common to both Parties, which naturally flow from this Source; and might ea&s;ily &s;hew, upon a full Di&s;play of them, that this Clamour, which pretends to be rai&s;ed for the Safety of Religion, has almo&s;t worn out the very Appearance of it; and rendered us not only the mo&s;t divided, but the mo&s;t immoral People upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>When our Nation is overflowed with &s;uch a Deluge of Impiety, it mu&s;t be a great Plea&s;ure to find any Expedient take Place, that has a Tendency to recover it out of &s;o di&s;mal a Con|dition. This is one great Rea&s;on why an ho|ne&s;t Man may rejoyce to &s;ee an Act &s;o near taking effect, for making Elections of Members to &s;erve in Parliament le&s;s frequent. I find my &s;elf prevented by other Writings (which have con&s;idered the Act now depending, in this particular Light) from expatiating upon this Subject. I &s;hall only mention two &s;hort Pieces which I have been ju&s;t now reading, un|der the following Titles, <HI>Arguments about the Alteration of the Triennial Elections of Parliament:</HI> And, <HI>The Alteration in the Triennial Act con&s;i|dered.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons for this Law, as it is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ettling His Maje&s;ty in his Throne; for ex|tingui&s;hing the Spirit of Rebellion; for procur|ing foreign Alliances; and other Advantages of the like Nature; carry a great Weight with them. But I am particularly plea&s;ed with it, as
<PB N="218" REF="227">
it may compo&s;e our unnatural Feuds and Ani|mo&s;ities, revive an hone&s;t Spirit of Indu&s;try in the Nation, and cut off frequent Occa&s;ions of brutal Rage and Intemperance. In &s;hort, as it will make us not only a more &s;afe, a more flouri&s;h|ing, and a more happy, but al&s;o a more Vertu|ous People.</P>

<P>IT is the Ambition of the Male-Part of the World to make them&s;elves E&s;teemed, and of the Female to make them&s;elves Beloved. As this is the la&s;t Paper which I &s;hall addre&s;s to my Fair Readers; I cannot perhaps oblige them more, than by leaving them as a kind of Le|gacy a certain Secret which &s;eldom fails of procuring this Affection, which they are natu|rally formed both to De&s;ire and to Obtain. This <HI>No&s;trum</HI> is comprized in the following Sentence of <HI>Seneca,</HI> which I &s;hall tran&s;late for the Service of my Countrey-women. <HI>Ego tibi mon&s;trabo Amatorium &s;ine medicamento, &s;ine herba, &s;ine ullius Veneficae carmine: &s;i vis Amari, Ama. I will di&s;cover to you a Philter that has neither Drug nor Simple, nor Enchantment in it. Love, if you would rai&s;e Love.</HI> If there be any Truth in this Di&s;covery, and this be &s;uch a Specifick as the Author pretends, there is nothing which makes the Sex more unamiable than Party-Rage. The fine&s;t Woman, in a Tran&s;port of Fury,
<PB N="219" REF="228">
lo&s;es the U&s;e of her Face. In&s;tead of charm|ing her Beholders, &s;he frights both Friend and Foe. The latter can never be &s;mitten by &s;o bitter an Enemy, nor the former captivated by a Nymph, who, upon Occa&s;ion, can be &s;o very Angry. The mo&s;t endearing of our beautiful Fellow-Subjects, are tho&s;e who&s;e Minds are the lea&s;t imbittered with the Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices of either Side; and who di&s;cover the native Sweetne&s;s of the Sex in every part of their Con|ver&s;ation and Behaviour. A lovely Woman, who thus flouri&s;hes in her Innocence and Good-Hu|mour, amid&s;t that mutual Spite and Rancour which prevails among her exa&s;perated Si&s;ter|hood, appears more amiable by the Singularity of her Character; and may be compared, with <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Bride, to <HI>a Lilly among Thorns.</HI></P>
<P>A State&s;woman is as ridiculous a Creature as a Cott-Quean. Each of the Sexes &s;hould keep within its particular Bounds, and content them|&s;elves to excel within their re&s;pective Di&s;tricts. When <HI>Venus</HI> complained to <HI>Jupiter</HI> of the wound which &s;he had received in Battel, the Father of the Gods &s;miled upon her, and put her in mind, that in&s;tead of mixing in a War, which was not her Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he &s;hould have been officiating in her proper Mini&s;try, and carrying on the De|lights of Marriage. The Delicacy of &s;everal modern Criticks has been offended with <HI>Homer's Billing&s;gate</HI> Warriors; but a &s;colding Heroe is, at the wor&s;t, a more tolerable Character than a Bully in Petticoats. To which we may add, that the keene&s;t Satyri&s;t, among the Antients, looked upon nothing as a more proper Subject of Raillery and Invective, than a Female Gla|diator.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229">

As this is likely to produce a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, till the Expiration of the pre&s;ent Parliament, among one half of our I&s;land, it is very rea&s;o|nable that the more beautiful Moiety of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a Truce a|mong them&s;elves for the &s;ame Term of Years.

<P>IT often happens, that extirpating the Love of Glory, which is ob&s;erved to take the deepe&s;t Root in noble Minds, tears up &s;everal Virtues with it; and that &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the De&s;ire of Fame, is apt to reduce Men to a State of Indolence and Supinene&s;s. But when, with|out any Incentive of Vanity, a Per&s;on of great Abilities is zealous for the Good of Mankind; and as &s;olicitous for the Concealment, as the Performance of illu&s;trious Actions; we may be &s;ure that he has &s;omething more than ordinary in his Compo&s;ition, and has a Heart filled with Goodne&s;s and Magnanimity.</P>
<P>There is not perhaps, in all Hi&s;tory, a greater In&s;tance of this Temper of Mind, than what ap|peared in that excellent Per&s;on, who&s;e Motto I have placed at the Head of this Paper. He had worn him&s;elf out in his Application to &s;uch Studies as made him u&s;eful or ornamental to the World, in concerting Schemes for the Wel|fare of his Countrey, and in pro&s;ecuting &s;uch Mea&s;ures as were nece&s;&s;ary for making tho&s;e Schemes effectual: But all this was done with a View to the Publick Good that &s;hould ri&s;e out of the&s;e generous Endeavours, and not to the Fame which &s;hould accrue to him&s;elf. Let the Reputation of the Action fall where it would; &s;o his Countrey reaped the Benefit of it, he was
<PB N="224" REF="233">
&s;atisfied. As this Turn of Mind threw off in a great Mea&s;ure the Oppo&s;itions of Envy and Competition, it enabled him to gain the mo&s;t Vain and Impracticable into his De&s;igns, and to bring about &s;everal great Events for the Safe|ty and Advantage of the Publick, which mu&s;t have died in their Birth, had he been as de&s;irous of appearing Beneficial to Mankind, as of be|ing &s;o.</P>
<P>As he was admitted into the &s;ecret and mo&s;t retired Thoughts and Coun&s;els of his Royal Ma&s;ter King <HI>William,</HI> a great Share in the Plan of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is univer&s;ally a&s;|cribed to him. And if he did not entirely pro|ject the Union of the two Kingdoms, and the Bill of Regency, which &s;eem to have been the only Methods in Humane Policy, for &s;ecuring to us &s;o ine&s;timable a Ble&s;&s;ing, there is none who will deny him to have been the chief Con|ductor in both the&s;e glorious Works. For Po|&s;terity are obliged to allow him that Prai&s;e af|ter his Death, which he indu&s;triou&s;ly declined while he was Living. His Life indeed &s;eems to have been prolonged beyond its Natural Term, under tho&s;e Indi&s;po&s;itions which hung upon the latter part of it, that he might have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing the happy Settlement take Place, which he had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf as the principal End of all his publick Labours. Nor was it a &s;mall Addition to his Happine&s;s, that by this Means he &s;aw tho&s;e who had been always his mo&s;t intimate Friends, and who had concerted with him &s;uch Mea&s;ures for the Gua|ranty of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, as drew up|on them the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Men who were a|ver&s;e to it, advanced to the highe&s;t Po&s;ts of Tru&s;t and Honour under His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.

I believe there are none of the&s;e Patriots, who will think it a Derogation from their Merit to have it &s;aid, that they received many Lights and Advantages from their Intimacy with my Lord <HI>Somers:</HI> Who had &s;uch a general Knowledge of Affairs, and &s;o tender a Concern for his Friends, that whatever Station they were in, they u&s;ual|ly applied to him for his Advice in every Per|plexity of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in Affairs of the greate&s;t Difficulty.</P>
<P>His Life, was in every Part of it, &s;et off with that graceful Mode&s;ty and Re&s;erve, which made his Virtues more beautiful, the more they were ca&s;t in &s;uch agreeable Shades.</P>
<P>His Religion was &s;incere, not o&s;tentatious; and &s;uch as in&s;pired him with an univer&s;al Be|nevolence towards all his Fellow-Subjects, not with Bitterne&s;s again&s;t any Part of them. He &s;hewed his firm Adherence to it as model'd by our national Con&s;titution, and was con&s;tant to its Offices of Devotion, both in Publick and in his Family. He appeared a Champion for it with great Reputation in the Cau&s;e of the &s;even Bi&s;hops, at a Time when the Church was Real|ly in Danger. To which we may add, that he held a &s;trict Friend&s;hip and Corre&s;pondence with the Great Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> being acted by the &s;ame Spirit of Candor and Moderation; and moved rather with Pity than Indignation towards the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e, who differed from him in the une&s;&s;ential Parts of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>His great Humanity appeared in the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances of his Conver&s;ation. You found it in the Benevolence of his A&s;pect, the Com|placency of his Behaviour, and the Tone of his Voice. His great Application to the &s;everer Studies of the Law, had not infected his Tem|per
<PB N="226" REF="235">
with any thing po&s;itive or litigious. He did not know what it was to wrangle on indifferent Points, to triumph in the Superiority of his Under&s;tanding, or to be Supercilious on the Side of Truth. He joined the greate&s;t Delica|cy of Good-Breeding to the greate&s;t Strength of Rea&s;on. By approving the Sentiments of a Per&s;on, with whom he conver&s;ed, in &s;uch Par|ticulars as were ju&s;t, he won him over from tho&s;e Points in which he was mi&s;taken; and had &s;o agreeable a Way of conveying Knowledge, that whoever conferred with him grew the wi|&s;er, without perceiving that he had been in|&s;tructed. We may probably a&s;cribe to this ma|&s;terly and engaging Manner of Conver&s;ation, the great E&s;teem which he had gained with the late Queen, while &s;he pur&s;ued tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which had carried the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation to the highe&s;t Pitch of Glory; notwith&s;tanding &s;he had entertained many unrea&s;onable Prejudices again&s;t him, before &s;he was acquainted with his per&s;o|nal Worth and Behaviour.</P>
<P>As in his political Capacity we have before &s;een how much he contributed to the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, and the Good of his Native Countrey, he was always true to the&s;e great Ends. His Character was uniform and con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and his whole Con|duct of a Piece. His Principles were founded in Rea&s;on, and &s;upported by Virtue; and there|fore did not lie at the Mercy of Ambition, A|varice, or Re&s;entment. His Notions were no le&s;s &s;teady and un&s;haken, than ju&s;t and upright. In a Word, he concluded his Cour&s;e among the &s;ame well-cho&s;en Friend&s;hips and Alliances, with which he began it.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="236">
This Great Man was not more Con&s;picuous as a Patriot and a State&s;man, than as a Per&s;on of univer&s;al Knowledge and Learning. As by di|viding his Time between the publick Scenes of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the private Retirements of Life, he took care to keep up both the Great and Good Man; &s;o by the &s;ame Means he accom|pli&s;hed him&s;elf not only in the Knowledge of Men and Things, but in the Skill of the mo&s;t refined Arts and Sciences. That unwearied Di|ligence, which followed him through all the Stages of his Life, gave him &s;uch a thorough In&s;ight into the Laws of the Land, that he pa&s;|&s;ed for one of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, at his fir&s;t Appearance in it. Though he made a regular Progre&s;s through the &s;everal Honours of the Long Robe, he was always looked upon as one who de&s;erved a Superior Station to that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; till he ar|rived at the highe&s;t Dignity to which tho&s;e Stu|dies could advance him.</P>
<P>He enjoyed in the highe&s;t Perfection two Ta|lents, which do not often meet in the &s;ame Per|&s;on, the greate&s;t Strength of good Sen&s;e, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Ta&s;te of Politene&s;s. With|out the fir&s;t, Learning is but an Incumbrance; and without the la&s;t, is ungraceful. My Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was Ma&s;ter of the&s;e two Qualifications in &s;o eminent a Degree, that all the Parts of Knowledge appeared in him with &s;uch an addi|tional Strength and Beauty, as they want in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others. If he delivered his Opini|on of a Piece of Poetry, a Statue, or a Picture, there was &s;omething &s;o ju&s;t and delicate in his Ob&s;ervations, as naturally produced Plea&s;ure and A&s;&s;ent in tho&s;e who heard him.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="237">
His Solidity and Elegance, improved by the reading of the fine&s;t Authors both of the Learn|ed and Modern Languages, di&s;covered it&s;elf in all his Productions. His Oratory was ma&s;cu|line and per&s;ua&s;ive, free from every thing tri|vial and affected. His Style in Writing was cha&s;te and pure, but at the &s;ame time full of Spirit and Politene&s;s; and fit to convey the mo&s;t intricate Bu&s;ine&s;s to the Under&s;tanding of the Reader, with the utmo&s;t Clearne&s;s and Per|&s;picuity. And here it is to be lamented, that this extraordinary Per&s;on, out of his natural Aver&s;ion to Vain-glory, wrote &s;everal Pieces as well as performed &s;everal Actions, which he did not a&s;&s;ume the Honour of: Though at the &s;ame time &s;o many Works of this Nature have appeared, which every one has a&s;cribed to him, that I believe no Author of the greate&s;t Emi|nence would deny my Lord <HI>Somers</HI> to have been the be&s;t Writer of the Age in which he lived.</P>
<P>This noble Lord, for the great Extent of his Knowledge and Capacity, has been often com|pared with the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> who had al&s;o been Chancellor of <HI>England.</HI> But the Conduct of the&s;e two extraordinary Per&s;ons, under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, was va&s;tly different. They were both Impeached by a Hou&s;e of Commons. One of them, as he had given ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for it, &s;unk under it; and was reduced to &s;uch an abject Submi&s;&s;ion, as very much dimini&s;hed the Lu&s;tre of &s;o exalted a Character: But my Lord <HI>Somers</HI> was too well fortified in his Inte|grity to fear the Impotence of an Attempt upon his Reputation; and though his Accu&s;ers would gladly have dropped their Impeachment, he was in&s;tant with them for the Pro&s;ecution of it, and
<PB N="229" REF="238">
would not let that Matter re&s;t till it was brought to an I&s;&s;ue. For the &s;ame Virtue and Great|ne&s;s of Mind which gave him a Di&s;regard of Fame, made him impatient of an unde&s;erved Reproach.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion but this wonderful Man will make one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd Figures in the Hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent Age; but we can|not expect that his Merit will &s;hine out in its proper Light, &s;ince he wrote many things which are not publi&s;hed in his Name; was at the Bot|tom of many excellent Coun&s;els, in which he did not appear; did Offices of Friend&s;hip to many Per&s;ons, who knew not from whom they were derived; and performed great Services to his Countrey, the Glory of which was trans|fer'd to others: In &s;hort, &s;ince he made it his Endeavour rather to do worthy Actions than to gain an illu&s;trious Character.</P>

<P>IT requires no &s;mall Degree of Re&s;olution, to be an Author in a Countrey &s;o Faceti|ous and Satyrical as this of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Such a one rai&s;es a kind of Alarm among his Fel|low-Subjects, and by pretending to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from the Herd, becomes a Mark of pub|lick Cen&s;ure, and &s;ometimes a &s;tanding Object of Raillery and Ridicule. Writing is indeed a Pro|vocation to the Envious, and an Affront to the
<PB N="230" REF="239">
Ignorant. How often do we &s;ee a Per&s;on, who&s;e Intentions are vi&s;ibly to do Good by the Works which he publi&s;hes, treated in as &s;curri|lous a Manner, as if he were an Enemy to Mankind? All the little Scramblers after Fame fall upon him, publi&s;h every Blot in his Life, de|pend upon Hear-&s;ay to defame him, and have recour&s;e to their own Invention, rather than &s;uffer him to erect him&s;elf into an Author with Impunity. Even tho&s;e who write on the mo&s;t indifferent Subjects, and are conver&s;ant only in Works of Ta&s;te, are looked upon as Men that make a kind of In&s;ult upon Society, and ought to be humbled as Di&s;turbers of the publick Tran|quillity. Not only the Dull and the Malicious, which make a formidable Party in our I&s;land, but the whole Fraternity of Writers ri&s;e up in Arms again&s;t every new Intruder into the World of Fame; and a thou&s;and to one, before they have done, prove him not only to be a Fool, but a Knave. Succe&s;sful Authors do what they can to exclude a Competitor, while the Un&s;uc|ce&s;sful with as much Eagerne&s;s lay in their Claim to him as a Brother. This natural An|tipathy to a Man who breaks his Ranks, and endeavours to &s;ignalize his Parts in the World, has very probably hindered many Per&s;ons from making their Appearance in Print, who might have enriched our Countrey with better Produ|ctions in all kinds than any that are now extant. The Truth of it is, the active Part of Mankind, as they do mo&s;t for the Good of their Contem|poraries, very de&s;ervedly gain the greate&s;t Share in their Applau&s;es; whil&s;t Men of Speculative Endowments, who employ their Talents in Writing, as they may equally benefit or amu&s;e &s;ucceeding Ages, have generally the greate&s;t
<PB N="231" REF="240">
Share in the Admiration of Po&s;terity. Both good and bad Writers may receive great Satis|faction from the Pro&s;pects of Futurity; as in After-ages the former will be remember'd and the latter forgotten.</P>
<P>Among all Sets of Authors, there are none who draw upon them&s;elves more Di&s;plea&s;ure, than tho&s;e who deal in political Matters, which indeed is very often too ju&s;tly incurred; con&s;i|dering that Spirit of Rancour and Virulence, with which Works of this Nature generally a|bound. The&s;e are not only regarded as Au|thors, but as Parti&s;ans, and are &s;ure to exa&s;pe|rate at lea&s;t one half of their Readers. Other Writers offend only the Stupid or Jealous a|mong their Countreymen; but the&s;e, let their Cau&s;e be never &s;o Ju&s;t, mu&s;t expect to irritate a &s;upernumerary Party of the &s;elf-intere&s;ted, prejudiced, and ambitious. They may howe|ver comfort them&s;elves with con&s;idering, that if they gain any unju&s;t Reproach from one Side, they generally acquire more Prai&s;e than they de|&s;erve from the other: and that Writings of this kind, if conducted with Candour and Imparti|ality, have a more particular Tendency to the Good of their Countrey, and of the pre&s;ent Age, than any other Compo&s;itions what&s;oever.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider an Author farther, as the Sub|ject of Obloquy and Detraction. We may ob|&s;erve with what Plea&s;ure a Work is received by the invidious Part of Mankind, in which a Wri|ter falls &s;hort of him&s;elf, and does not an&s;wer the Character which he has acquired by his for|mer Productions. It is a fine Simile in one of Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s Prologues, which compares a Writer to a Buttering Game&s;ter, that &s;takes
<PB N="232" REF="241">
all his Winnings upon every Ca&s;t: So that if he lo&s;es the la&s;t Throw, he is &s;ure to be undone. It would be well for all Authors, if, like that Gentleman, they knew when to give over, and to de&s;i&s;t from any farther Pur&s;uits after Fame, whil&s;t they are in the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. On the other Hand there is not a more melancholy Object in the Learned World, than a Man who has written him&s;elf down. As the Publick is more di&s;po&s;ed to Cen&s;ure than to Prai&s;e, his Readers will ridicule him for his la&s;t Works, when they have forgot to applaud tho&s;e which preceded them. In this Ca&s;e, where a Man has lo&s;t his Spirit by old Age and Infirmity, one could wi&s;h that his Friends and Relations would keep him from the u&s;e of Pen, Ink and Paper, if he is not to be reclaimed by any other Methods.</P>
<P>The Author indeed often grows old before the Man, e&s;pecially if he treats on Subjects of Invention, or &s;uch as ari&s;e from Reflections upon Human Nature: For in this ca&s;e, neither his own Strength of Mind, nor tho&s;e Parts of Life which are commonly unob&s;erved, will furni&s;h him with &s;ufficient Materials to be at the &s;ame Time both plea&s;ing and voluminous. We find even in the outward Dre&s;s of Poetry, that Men, who write much without taking Breath, very often return to the &s;ame Phra&s;es and Forms of Expre&s;&s;ion, as well as to the &s;ame Manner of Thinking. Au|thors, who have thus drawn off the Spirit of their Thoughts, &s;hould lie &s;till for &s;ome Time, till their Minds have gathered fre&s;h Strength, and by Reading, Reflection and Conver&s;ation, laid in a new Stock of Elegancies, Sentiments, and Images of Nature. The Soil, that is worn with
<PB N="233" REF="242">
too frequent Culture, mu&s;t lie fallow for a while, till it has recruited its exhau&s;ted Salts, and again enriched it&s;elf by the Ventilations of the Air, the Dews of Heaven, and the kindly Influences of the Sun.</P>
<P>For my own Part, notwith&s;tanding this ge|neral Malevolence towards tho&s;e who commu|nicate their Thoughts in Print, I cannot but look with a friendly Regard on &s;uch as do it, provided there is no Tendency in their Writings to Vice and Prophanene&s;s. If the Thoughts of &s;uch Authors have nothing in them, they at lea&s;t do no harm, and &s;hew an hone&s;t Indu&s;try and a good Intention in the Compo&s;er. If they teach me any thing I did not know before, I cannot but look upon my &s;elf as obliged to the Writer, and con&s;ider him as my particular Benefactor, if he conveys to me one of the greate&s;t Gifts that is in the Power of Man to be&s;tow, an Improve|ment of my Under&s;tanding, an innocent A|mu&s;ement, or an Incentive to &s;ome moral Vir|tue. Were not Men of Abilities thus com|municative, their Wi&s;dom would be in a great Mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s, and their Experience unin&s;tru|ctive. There would be no Bu&s;ine&s;s in Solitude, nor proper Relaxations in Bu&s;ine&s;s. By the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances, the retir'd Man lives in the World, if not above it; Pa&s;&s;ion is compo&s;ed; Thought hindred from being barren; and the Mind from preying upon it&s;elf. That E&s;teem, indeed, which is paid to good Writers by their Po&s;terity, &s;uf|ficiently &s;hews the Merit of Per&s;ons who are thus employed. Who does not now more ad|mire <HI>Cicero</HI> as an Author, than as a Con&s;ul of <HI>Rome</HI>!

<P>When I con&s;ider my &s;elf as a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Free-holder, I am in a particular Manner plea&s;ed with the Labours of tho&s;e who have improved our Language with the Tran&s;lation of old <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Authors; and by that Means let us into the Knowledge of what pa&s;&s;ed in the famous Governments of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> We have already mo&s;t of their Hi&s;torians in our own Tongue: And what is &s;till more for the Honour of our Language, it has been taught to expre&s;s with Elegance the Greate&s;t of their Poets in each Nation. The illiterate among our Coun|treymen, may learn to judge from <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Vir|gil</HI> of the mo&s;t perfect Epic Performance: And tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Homer,</HI> which have already been publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> give us rea&s;on to think that the <HI>Iliad</HI> will appear in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with as little Di&s;advantage to that immortal Poem.</P>
<P>There is another Author, whom I have long wi&s;hed to &s;ee well tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as his Work is filled with a Spirit of Liberty, and more directly tends to rai&s;e Sentiments of Honour and Virtue in his Reader, than any of the poeti|cal Writings of Antiquity. I mean the <HI>Phar&s;a|lia</HI> of <HI>Lucan.</HI> This is the only Author of Con|&s;ideration among the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, who was not explained for the U&s;e of the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> for a very obvious Rea&s;on; becau&s;e the whole <HI>Phar|&s;alia</HI> would have been no le&s;s than a Satyr upon the <HI>French</HI> Form of Government.

the Sentiments with greater Per&s;picuity, and in a finer Turn of Phra&s;e and Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>As Undertakings of &s;o difficult a Nature re|quire the greate&s;t Encouragements, one cannot but rejoyce to &s;ee tho&s;e general Sub&s;criptions which have been made to them; e&s;pecially &s;ince if the two Works la&s;t mentioned are not fini&s;h|ed by tho&s;e ma&s;terly Hands, which are now em|ployed in them, we may de&s;pair of &s;eeing them attempted by others.</P>

<P>AS the Care of our National Commerce re|dounds more to the Riches and Pro&s;perity of the Publick, than any other Act of Govern|ment, it is pity that we do not &s;ee the State of it marked out in every particular Reign with greater Di&s;tinction and Accuracy, than what is u&s;ual among our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians. We may however ob&s;erve in general, that the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our Monarchs have not been le&s;s in|du&s;trious to extend their Trade, than their Do|minions; as it manife&s;tly turns in a much higher Degree to the Welfare of the People, if not to the Glory of the Soveraign.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of our Kings who carried our Com|merce, and con&s;equently our Navigation to a ve|ry great Height, was <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. This victorious Prince, by his many excellent Laws
<PB N="236" REF="249">
for the Encouragement of Trade, enabled his Subjects to &s;upport him in his many glorious Wars upon the Continent, and turned the Scale &s;o much in Favour of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchandi&s;e, that, by a Balance of Trade taken in his Time, the Exported Commodities amounted to Two Hundred Ninety Four Thou&s;and Pounds, and the Imported but to Thirty Eight Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of his Succe&s;&s;ors, under who&s;e Regu|lations our Trade flouri&s;h'd mo&s;t, were <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> As the fir&s;t of the&s;e was for his great Wi&s;dom very often &s;tyled the <HI>Engli&s;h Solomon,</HI> he followed the Ex|ample of that wi&s;e King in nothing more, than by advancing the Traffick of his People. By this Means he reconciled to him the Minds of his Subjects, &s;trengthened him&s;elf in their Affe|ctions, improved very much the Navigation of the Kingdom, and repelled the frequent At|tempts of his Enemies</P>
<P>As for Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &s;he had always the Trade of her Kingdom very much at Heart, and we may ob&s;erve the Effects of it through the whole Cour&s;e of her Reign, in the Love and O|bedience of her People, as well as in the Defeats and Di&s;appointments of her Enemies.</P>
<P>It is with great Plea&s;ure that we &s;ee our pre|&s;ent Soveraign applying his Thoughts &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully to the Advancement of our Traffick and con&s;idering him&s;elf as the King of a Tra|ding I&s;land. His Maje&s;ty has already gained very con&s;iderable Advantages for his People and is &s;till employed in concerting Schemes and forming Treaties, for retrieving and en|larging our Privileges in the World of Com|merce.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="250">
I &s;hall only in this Paper take Notice of the Treaty concluded at <HI>Madrid</HI> on the 14^t^h of <HI>De|cember</HI> la&s;t, 1715; and by comparing it with that concluded at <HI>Utrecht</HI> on the 9^t^h of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> 1713, &s;hew &s;everal particulars in which the Treaty made with his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty is more advantageous to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than that which was made in the la&s;t Reign; after this general Ob&s;ervation, that it is equally &s;urprizing how &s;o bad a Treaty came to be made at the end of a glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful War; and how &s;o good a One has been obtained in the Beginning of a Reign di&s;turbed by &s;uch inte&s;tine Commotions. But we may learn from hence, that the Wi&s;dom of a Soveraign, and the Integrity of his Mini&s;ters, are more nece&s;&s;ary for bringing about Works of &s;uch Con&s;equence for the publick Good, than any Juncture of Time, or any other the mo&s;t favourable Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t here premi&s;e that by the Treaty con|cluded at <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1667, the Duties of Impor|tation payable upon the Manufactures and Pro|ducts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> amounted upon the e|&s;tabli&s;hed Valuation in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Book of Rates, (after the Deduction of the Gratia's).

<P>After this &s;hort Account of the State of our Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> before the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> under the late Queen, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that by the explanatory Articles of this la&s;t mention|ed Treaty, the Duties of Importation upon the Products and Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="251">
were augmented in <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> to 27 &frac15; <HI>per Cent</HI> at a Medium.</P>
<P>But by the late Treaty made with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the &s;aid Duties are again re|duced according to the afore&s;aid Treaty of 1667 And the Deduction of the Gratia's is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed as an inviolable Law, whereas, before, the Gratia's of the Farmers particularly were alto|gether precarious, and depended entirely upon Courte&s;y.</P>
<P>That the common Reader may under&s;tand the Nature of the&s;e Gratia's, he mu&s;t know that when the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had laid higher Du|ties upon our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, than what the Merchants were able or willing to comply with, he u&s;ed to abate a certain Part: which Indulgence, or Abatement, went under the Name of a Gratia. But when he had Farmed out the&s;e his Cu&s;toms to &s;everal of his Subjects, the Farmers, in order to draw more Merchan|di&s;e to their re&s;pective Ports, and thereby to in|crea&s;e their own particular Profits, u&s;ed to make new Abatements, or Gratia's to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Merchants, endeavouring &s;ometimes to out|vy one another in &s;uch Indulgences, and by that Means to get a greater Proportion of Cu&s;tom into their own Hands.</P>
<P>But to proceed: The Duties on Exportation may be computed to be rai&s;ed by the <HI>Utrecht</HI> Treaty, near as much as the fore&s;aid Duties of Importation: Whereas, by the Treaty made with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, they are reduced to their ancient Standard.</P>
<P>Complaint having been made, that the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> after the Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms had taken &s;e|veral <HI>New-England</HI> and other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ships ga|thering Salt at the I&s;land of <HI>Tertuga,</HI> a very full
<PB N="239" REF="252">
and ju&s;t Report concerning that Affair was laid before Her late Maje&s;ty, of which I &s;hall give the Reader the following Extract:<Q><P>'Your Maje&s;ty's Subjects have, from the fir&s;t Settlement of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> had a free Acce&s;s to this I&s;land; and have without Interruptions, unle&s;s in Time of War, u&s;ed to take what Salt they plea&s;ed there: And we have Proofs of that U&s;age for above 50 Years, as appears by Certificates of Per&s;ons who have been employed in that Trade.</P>
<P>'It doth not appear, upon the &s;tricte&s;t Enqui|ry, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ever inhabited or &s;ettled on the &s;aid I&s;land; nor is it probable they ever did, it being all either barren Rock, or dry Sand, and having no fre&s;h Water or Provi&s;i|ons in it.</P>
<P>'We take Leave to lay before Your Maje&s;ty, the Con&s;equence of Your Maje&s;ty's Subjects being prohibited to fetch Salt at <HI>Tertuga</HI>; which will in part appear from the Number of Ships u&s;ing that Trade, being, as we are informed, one Year with another about 100 Sail.</P>
<P>'The Salt carried from thence to <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> is u&s;ed chiefly for curing of Fi&s;h, which is either <HI>Cod, Scale-Fi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Mackrel:</HI> The for|mer of which is the principal Branch of the Returns made from the Continent to <HI>Great Britain</HI> by Way of <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and the <HI>Straits,</HI> for the Woollen and other Goods &s;ent from this Kingdom thither. Be&s;ides which, the <HI>Scale-Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Mackrel</HI> are of &s;uch Con&s;equence, that the Sugar I&s;lands cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them, their Negroes being chiefly &s;upported by this Fi&s;h: So that if they were not &s;upplied therewith from <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> (which they cannot be, if Your Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="240" REF="253">
Subjects are prohibited from getting Salt at <HI>Tertuga</HI>) they would not be able to carry on their Sugar Works. This hath been confirm|ed to us by &s;everal con&s;iderable Planters con|cerned in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>'Upon the whole, Your Maje&s;ty's Subjects having enjoyed an uninterrupted U&s;age of ga|thering Salt at <HI>Tertuga</HI> ever &s;ince the fir&s;t Set|tlement of the Continent as afore&s;aid, we humbly &s;ubmit to Your Maje&s;ty the Con&s;e|quence of pre&s;erving that U&s;age and Right upon which the Trade of Your Maje&s;ty's Plantations &s;o much depends.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding it appears from what is a|bove-written, that our Sugar-I&s;lands were like to &s;uffer con&s;iderably for want of Fi&s;h from <HI>New-England,</HI> no Care was taken to have this Matter remedied by the Explanatory Articles, which were po&s;terior to the above mentioned Report.</P>
<P>However in the Third Article of the Treaty made with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, this Bu&s;ine&s;s is fully &s;ettled to our Advantage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants having had &s;everal Hard&s;hips put upon them at <HI>Bilboa,</HI> which oc|ca&s;ioned the Decay of our Trade at that Place the &s;aid Merchants did make and execute in the Year 1700, a Treaty of Privileges with the Ma|gi&s;trates and Inhabitants of St. <HI>Ander,</HI> very much to the Advantage of this Kingdom, in order to their removing and &s;ettling there: The Effect of which was prevented by the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the War which &s;oon after en&s;ued. This Matter it &s;eems, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;lighted or neglected by the Managers of the <HI>U+trecht</HI> Treaty: For, by the 14^t^h Article of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Treaty, there is only <HI>a Liberty given to the</HI> Bri+
<PB N="241" REF="254">
ti&s;h <HI>Subjects to &s;ettle and dwell at St.</HI> Ander, <HI>upon the Terms of the</HI> 9^t^h <HI>and</HI> 30^t^h <HI>Articles of the Trea|ty of</HI> 1667, which are general. But no Regard was had to the forementioned Treaty of Privi|leges in 1700; whereas by the Second Article of the Treaty now made with His pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, the forementioned Treaty of Privileges with St. <HI>Ander</HI> is confirmed and ratified.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable Advantage is, that the <HI>French,</HI> by the Treaty made with His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, are to pay the &s;ame Duties at the <HI>Dry-Ports,</HI> through which they pa&s;s by Land-Car|tiage, as we pay upon Importation or Exporta|tion by Sea: Which was not provided for by the <HI>Utrecht</HI> Treaty.</P>
<P>By the Cedula's annexed to the Treaty of 1667, the valuable Privilege of having Judge-Con&s;er|vators (appointed to make a more &s;peedy and le&s; expen&s;ive Determination of all Controver|&s;ies ari&s;ing in Trade) was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. But by the 15^t^h Article of <HI>Utrecht</HI> that Privilege was in effect given up. For it is therein only &s;tipu|lated, <HI>That in ca&s;e any other Nation have that Pri|vilege, we &s;hall in like Manner enjoy it.</HI> But by the 5^t^h Article of the Treaty now made with his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty it is &s;tipulated, that <HI>We &s;hall enjoy all the Rights, Privileges, Franchi&s;es, Ex|emptions, and Immunities what&s;oever, which we enjoyed by virtue of the Royal Cedula's or Ordinan|ces by the Treaty of</HI> 1667. So that hereby the Privilege of Judge-Con&s;ervators is again con|firmed to us.</P>
<P>As nothing but the Reputation of His Maje|&s;ty in foreign Countries, and of his fixed Pur|po&s;es to pur&s;ue the real Good of His Kingdoms, could bring about Treaties of this Nature: So 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to reflect with Patience on the
<PB N="242" REF="255">
Folly and Ingratitude of tho&s;e Men, who la|bour to di&s;turb Him in the mid&s;t of the&s;e His Royal Cares, and to mi&s;repre&s;ent His generous Endeavours for the Good of His People.</P>

<Q>O Fortunatos Mercatores!&mdash; </Q>
<BIBL>Hor.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SEveral Authors have written on the Advan|tage of Trade in general; which is indeed &s;o copious a Subject, that as it is impo&s;&s;ible to exhau&s;t it in a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o it is very dif|ficult to ob&s;erve any thing new upon it. I &s;hall, therefore, only con&s;ider Trade in this Pa|per, as it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to the Safety, Strength, and Pro&s;perity of our own Nation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, as we are an I&s;land accom|modated on all Sides with convenient Ports, and encompa&s;&s;ed with navigable Seas, we &s;hould be inexcu&s;able, if we did not make the&s;e Ble&s;|&s;ings of Providence and Advantages of Nature turn to their proper Account. The mo&s;t cele|brated Merchants in the World, and tho&s;e who make the greate&s;t Figure in Antiquity, were &s;ituated in the little I&s;land of <HI>Tyre,</HI> which, by the prodigious Increa&s;e of its Wealth and Strength at Sea, did very much influence the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable Kingdoms and Empires on the neigh|bouring Continent, and gave birth to the <HI>Car|thaginians,</HI> who afterwards exceeded all other Nations in Naval Power. The old <HI>Tyre</HI> was
<PB N="243" REF="256">
indeed &s;eated on the Continent, from whence the Inhabitants, after having been be&s;ieged by the Great King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> for the Space of thir|teen Years, withdrew them&s;elves and their Ef|fects into the I&s;land of <HI>Tyre</HI>; where, by the Be|nefit of &s;uch a Situation, a Trading People were enabled to hold out for many Ages again&s;t the Attempts of their Enemies, and became the Merchants of the World.</P>
<P>Further; as an I&s;land, we are acce&s;&s;ible on every Side, and expo&s;ed to perpetual Inva&s;ions; again&s;t which it is impo&s;&s;ible to fortify our&s;elves &s;ufficiently, without &s;uch a Power at Sea, as is not to be kept up, but by a People who flouri&s;h in Commerce. To which we mu&s;t add, that our inland Towns being de&s;titute of Fortificati|ons, it is our indi&s;pen&s;able Concern to pre&s;erve this our Naval Strength, which is as a general Bulwark to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; as an I&s;land, it has not been thought agreeable to the true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Policy to make Ac|qui&s;itions upon the Continent. In lieu, there|fore, of &s;uch an Increa&s;e of Dominion, it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to extend to the utmo&s;t our Trade and Navigation. By this means, we reap the Advan|tages of Conque&s;t, without Violence or Inju|&s;tice; we not only &s;trengthen our&s;elves, but gain the Wealth of our Neighbours in an ho|ne&s;t Way; and, without any Act of Ho&s;tility, lay the &s;everal Nations of the World under a kind of Contribution.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Trade is fitted to the Nature of our Countrey, as it abounds with a great Profu&s;ion of Commodities of its own Growth very con|venient for other Countries, and is naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">titute of many Things &s;uited to the Exigen|ces, Ornaments and Plea&s;ures of Life, which
<PB N="244" REF="257">
may be fetched from foreign Parts. But, that which is more particularly to be remarked, our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Products are of &s;uch Kinds and Quan|tities, as can turn the Balance of Trade to our Advantage, and enable us to &s;ell more to Fo|reigners, than we have occa&s;ion to buy from them.</P>
<P>To this we mu&s;t add, that by extending a well-regulated Trade, we are as great Gainers by the Commodities of many other Countries, as by tho&s;e of our own Nation; and by &s;up|plying foreign Markets with the Growth and Manufactures of the mo&s;t di&s;tant Regions, we receive the &s;ame Profit from them, as if they were the Produce of our own I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We are not a little obliged to Trade, as it has been a great Means of civilizing our Nation, and bani&s;hing out of it all the Remains of its antient Barbarity. There are many bitter Sayings again&s;t I&s;landers in general, repre&s;ent|ing them as fierce, treacherous, and inho&s;pita|ble. Tho&s;e who live on the Continent have &s;uch Opportunities of a frequent Intercour&s;e with Men of different Religions and Langua+ges, and who live under different Laws and Governments, that they become more kind&punc; benevolent, and open-hearted to their Fellow Creatures, than tho&s;e who are the Inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of an I&s;land, that hath not &s;uch Conver&s;ation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the re&s;t of the Species. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Ob&s;erva+tion upon our Fore-fathers is very much to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; who remarks, That tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> 'em that lived upon the Coa&s;t, or in Sea Port Towns, were much more Civilized, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e who had their Dwellings in the Inlan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Countrey, by rea&s;on of frequent Communica+tions with their Neighbours on the Continent.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="258">
In the la&s;t Place. Trade is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for us, as our Countrey is very populous. It employs Multitudes of Hands both by Sea and Land, and furni&s;hes the poore&s;t of our Fel|low-Subjects with the Opportunities of gaining an hone&s;t Livelihood. The skilful or indu&s;tri|ous find their Account in it: And many, who have no fixed Property in the Soil of our Coun|trey, can make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of as con&s;i|derable E&s;tates, as tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t Portions of the Land de&s;cending to them by Inheritance.</P>
<P>If what has been often charged upon us by our Neighbours has any Truth in it, That we are prone to Sedition and delight in Change, there is no Cure more proper for this Evil than Trade, which thus &s;upplies Bu&s;ine&s;s to the A|ctive, and Wealth to the Indigent. When Men are ea&s;y in their Circum&s;tances, they are natu|rally Enemies to Innovations: And indeed we &s;ee in the Cour&s;e of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories, ma|ny of our popular Commotions have taken their Ri&s;e from the Decay of &s;ome Branch of Com|merce, which created Di&s;contents among Per|&s;ons concerned in the Manufactures of the King|dom. When Men are &s;owred with Poverty, and unemployed, they ea&s;ily give into any Pro|&s;pect of Change, which may better their Conditi|on, and cannot make it much wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Since therefore it is manife&s;t, that the pro|moting of our Trade and Commerce is nece&s;&s;a|ry and e&s;&s;ential to our Security and Strength, our Peace and Pro&s;perity, it is our particular Happine&s;s to &s;ee a Monarch on the Throne, who is &s;en&s;ible of the true Intere&s;t of his King|doms, and applies him&s;elf with &s;o much Suc|ce&s;s to the Advancement of our National Com|merce.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="259">
The Reader may &s;ee, in my la&s;t Paper, the Advantages which His Maje&s;ty has gained for us in our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade. In this, I &s;hall give a &s;hort Account of tho&s;e procured for us from the <HI>Au&s;train</HI> Low-Countries, by Virtue of the 26^t^h Article of the Barrier Treaty made at <HI>Ant|werp</HI> the 15^t^h of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>This Branch of our Trade was regulated by a <HI>Tariff,</HI> or Declaration of the Duties of Import and Export in the Year 1670. which was &s;uper|&s;eded by another made in 1680. that continued till this la&s;t <HI>Tariff</HI> &s;ettled in 1715. with His pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty. As for the two former, tho&s;e who are at the Pains of peru&s;ing them will find, the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1670. laid higher Duties on &s;eve|ral con&s;iderable Branches of our Trade, than that of 1680, but in many Particulars, was more favourable to us than the latter. Now, by the pre&s;ent <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1715. the&s;e Duties are fixed and regulated for the future by tho&s;e which were mo&s;t favourable in either of the former <HI>Tariffs:</HI> And all our Products and Manufa|ctures (one only excepted, which I &s;hall name by and by) &s;ettled upon rather an ea&s;ier foot than ever.</P>
<P>Our Woollen Cloths, being the mo&s;t profita|ble Branch of our Trade into the&s;e Countries, have by this means gained a very con&s;iderable Advantage. For the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1680. having laid higher Duties upon the finer &s;orts, and lower Duties on ordinary Cloth, than what were &s;et|tled in the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1670. His Maje&s;ty has, by the pre&s;ent Treaty, reduced the Duties on the finer &s;orts to the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1670. and confirmed the Duties on ordinary Cloth according to the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1680. In&s;omuch that this pre&s;ent <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">15. con&s;idered, with relation to this valu+
<PB N="247" REF="260">
able part of our Trade, reduces the Duties at lea&s;t one &s;ixth Part, &s;uppo&s;ing the Exportation of all &s;orts to be equal. But as there is always a much greater Exportation of the ordinary Cloth, than of the finer &s;orts, the Reduction of the&s;e Duties becomes &s;till much more con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that there had been &s;everal Innovations made to the Detriment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant &s;ince the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1680. all which Innovations are now entirely &s;et a&s;ide upon every Species of Goods, except Butter, which is here particularly mentioned, becau&s;e we cannot be too minute and circum&s;tantial in Accounts of this Nature. This Article howe|ver is moderated, and is rated in proportion to what has been, and is &s;till to be, paid by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>As our Commerce with the <HI>Netherlands</HI> is thus &s;ettled to the Advantage of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mer|chants, &s;o is it much to their Satisfaction: And if His Maje&s;ty, in the &s;everal &s;ucceeding Parts of his Reign (which we hope may be many Years prolonged) &s;hould advance our Com|merce in the &s;ame Proportion as he has already done, we may expect to &s;ee it in a more flou|ri&s;hing Condition, than under any of His Royal Ance&s;tors. He &s;eems to place his Greatne&s;s in the Riches and Pro&s;perity of his People; and what may we not hope from him in a Time of Quiet and Tranquillity? Since, during the late Di&s;tractions, he has done &s;o much for the Ad|vantage of our Trade, when we could not rea|&s;onably expect he &s;hould have been able to do any thing.</P>

<P>ONE would wonder how any Per&s;on en|dowed with the ordinary Principles of Pru|dence and Humanity, &s;hould de&s;ire to be King of a Countrey, in which the E&s;tabli&s;hed Religi|on is directly oppo&s;ite to that which he him&s;elf profe&s;&s;es. Were it po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch a one to accompli&s;h his De&s;igns, his own Rea&s;on mu&s;t tell him, there could not be a more unea&s;y Prince, not a more unhappy People. But how it can enter into the Wi&s;hes of any private Per|&s;ons to be the Subjects of a Man, who&s;e Faith obliges him to u&s;e the mo&s;t effectual means for extirpating their Religion, is altogether incom|prehen&s;ible, but upon the Suppo&s;ition that what|ever Principles they &s;eem to adhere to, their In|tere&s;t, Ambition, or Revenge, is much more active and predominant in their Minds, than the Love of their Countrey, or of its National Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>I have never heard of any one particular Be|nefit, which either the <HI>Pretender</HI> him&s;elf, or the Favourers of his Cau&s;e, could promi&s;e to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation from the Succe&s;s of his Preten|&s;ions; though the Evils which would ari&s;e from it, are numberle&s;s and evident. The&s;e Men content them&s;elves with one general A&s;&s;ertion which often appears in their Writings, and in their Di&s;cour&s;e; That the Kingdom will never be Quiet till he is upon the Throne. If by
<PB N="249" REF="262">
this Po&s;ition is meant, that tho&s;e will never be quiet who would endeavour to place him there, it may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome Truth in it; tho' we hope even the&s;e will be reduced to their Obedience by the Care of their Safety, if not by the Sen&s;e of their Duty. But on the other &s;ide, how ineffectual would this &s;trange Expedient be, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the publick Quiet and Tran|quillity, &s;hould it ever take place! for, by way of Argument, we may &s;uppo&s;e Impo&s;&s;ibilities. Would that Party of Men which comprehends the mo&s;t wealthy, and the mo&s;t valiant, of the Kingdom, and which, were the Cau&s;e put to a Tryal, would undoubtedly appear the mo&s;t nu|merous, (for I am far from thinking all tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of <HI>Tories,</HI> to be Favourers of the <HI>Pretender</HI>) can we, I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Men would live Quiet under a Reign which they have hitherto oppo&s;ed, and from which they apprehend &s;uch a manife&s;t De|&s;truction to their Countrey? Can we &s;uppo&s;e our pre&s;ent Royal Family, who are &s;o power|ful in foreign Dominions, &s;o &s;trong in their Relations and Alliances, and &s;o univer&s;ally &s;up|ported by the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> would continue Quiet, and not make vigorous and repeated Attempts for the Recovery of their Right, &s;hould it ever be wre&s;ted out of their Hands? Can we imagine that our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Clergy would be Quiet under a Prince, who is zealous for his Religion, and obliged by it to &s;ubvert tho&s;e Doctrines, which it is their Duty to defend and propagate? Nay, would any of tho&s;e Men them&s;elves, who are the Champions of this de&s;perate Cau&s;e, unle&s;s &s;uch of them as are profe&s;&s;ed Roman-Catholicks, or di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;o, live Quiet under a Government which
<PB N="250" REF="263">
at the be&s;t would make u&s;e of all indirect Me|thods in favour of a Religion, that is incon&s;i|&s;tent with our Laws and Liberties, and would impo&s;e on us &s;uch a Yoke, as neither We nor our Fathers were able to bear? All the Quiet that could be expected from &s;uch a Reign, mu&s;t be the Re&s;ult of ab&s;olute Power on the one Hand, and a de&s;picable Slavery on the other: And I believe every rea&s;onable Man will be of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian's Opinion, That a di&s;turb|ed Liberty is better than a quiet Servitude.</P>
<P>There is not indeed a greater Ab&s;urdity than to imagine the Quiet of a Nation can ari&s;e from an E&s;tabli&s;hment, in which the King would be of one Communion, and the People of ano|ther; e&s;pecially when the Religion of the Sove|raign carries in it the utmo&s;t Malignity to that of the Subject. If any of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchs might have hoped to Reign quietly under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, it would have been K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. who was received with all the Joy and Good|will that are natural to a People, newly re&s;cu'd from a Tyranny which had long oppre&s;&s;ed them in &s;everal Shapes. But this Monarch was too wi&s;e to own him&s;elf a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, even in that Juncture of Time; or to imagine it pra|cticable for an avowed Popi&s;h Prince to govern a Prote&s;tant People. His Brother tryed the Ex|periment, and every one knows the Succe&s;s of it.</P>
<P>As Speculations are be&s;t &s;upported by Facts, I &s;hall add to the&s;e dome&s;tick Examples one or two parallel In&s;tances out of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;to|ry, which may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew us, that a Scheme of Government is impracticable in which the Head does not agree with the Body, in that Point, which is of the greate&s;t Concern to rea|&s;onable

The States, to &s;hew farther their Apprehen&s;ions of Popery, and how incompatible they thought the Prin|ciples of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in a Soveraign were with tho&s;e of the Reform'd Religion in his Subjects, agreed that his Son &s;hould &s;ucceed to the Throne, provided he were brought up a Pro|te&s;tant.

<P>AS I was la&s;t Friday taking a Walk in the Park, I &s;aw a Countrey Gentleman at the &s;ide of <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>'s Pond, pulling a Handful of Oats out of his Pocket, and with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, gathering the Ducks about him. Upon my coming up to him, who &s;hould it be but my Friend the Fox-hunter, whom I gave
<PB N="253" REF="266">
&s;ome Account of in my 22^d Paper! I immedi|ately joined him, and partook of his Diver&s;ion, till he had not an Oat left in his Pocket. We then made the Tour of the Park together, when after having entertained me with the De&s;cription of a Decoy-Pond that lay near his Seat in the Countrey, and of a Meeting Hou&s;e that was going to be re-built in a neighbouring Market-Town, he gave me an Account of &s;ome very odd Adventures which he had met with that Morning; and which I &s;hall lay together in a &s;hort and faithful Hi&s;tory, as well as my Memo|ry will give me Leave.</P>
<P>My Friend, who has a natural Aver&s;ion to <HI>London,</HI> would never have come up, had not he been &s;ubpaena'd to it, as he told me, in or|der to give his Te&s;timony for one of the Rebels, whom he knew to be a very fair Sports-man. Having travelled all Night, to avoid the Inconve|niencies of Du&s;t and Heat, he arrived with his Guide, a little after break of Day, at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI>; where, to his great Surprize, he &s;aw a running Footman carried in a Chair, followed by a Water-man in the &s;ame kind of Vehicle. He was wondering at the Extravagance of their Ma&s;ters, that furni&s;hed them with &s;uch Dre&s;&s;es and Accommodations, when on a &s;udden he be|held a Chimney-Sweeper, convey'd after the &s;ame manner, with three Footmen running be|fore him. During his Progre&s;s through the <HI>Strand,</HI> he met with &s;everal other Figures no le&s;s wonderful and &s;urprizing. Seeing a great many in rich Morning-Gowns, he was amazed to find that Per&s;ons of Quality were up &s;o early: And was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee many Lawyers in their Bar-Gowns, when he knew by his Al|manack the Term was ended.

puzzled and confounded in him&s;elf what all this &s;hould mean, a Hackney-Coach chancing to pa&s;s by him, Four <HI>Batts</HI> popp'd out their Heads all at once, which very much fright|ed both him and his Hor&s;e. My Friend, who always takes Care to cure his Hor&s;e of &s;uch &s;tarting Fits, &s;purred him up to the very &s;ide of the Coach, to the no &s;mall Diver&s;ion of the <HI>Batts</HI>; who, &s;eeing him with his long Whip, Hor&s;e-hair Perriwig, Jockey Belt, and Coat without Sleeves, fancied him to be one of the Ma&s;queraders on Hor&s;eback, and received him with a loud Peal of Laughter. His Mind being full of idle Stories, which are &s;pread up and down the Nation by the Di&s;affected, he immediately concluded that all the Per&s;ons he &s;aw in the&s;e &s;trange Habits were Foreigners, and conceived a great Indignation again&s;t them, for pretending to laugh at an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Countrey-Gentleman. But he &s;oon recovered out of his Error, by hearing the Voices of &s;everal of them, and particularly of a Shepherde&s;s quarrelling with her Coachman, and threatning to break his Bones in very intel|ligible <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> though with a ma&s;culine Tone. His A&s;toni&s;hment &s;till increa&s;ed upon him, to &s;ee a continued Proce&s;&s;ion of Harlequins, Sea|ramouches, Punchinello's, and a thou&s;and o|ther merry Dre&s;&s;es, by which People of Quality di&s;tingui&s;h their Wit from that of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Being now advanced as far as <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> and ob&s;erving it to be the great Hive whence this Swarm of Chimeras i&s;&s;ued forth from Time to Time, my Friend took his Station among a Clu&s;ter of Mob, who were making them&s;elves merry with their Betters. The fir&s;t that came out was a very venerable Matron, with a No&s;e and Chin, that were within a very littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of

touching one another. My Friend, at the fir&s;t View fancying her to be an old Woman of Quality, out of his good breeding put off his Hat to her, when the Per&s;on pulling off her Ma&s;que, to his great Surprize appear'd a Smock-faced young Fellow. His Attention was &s;oon taken off from this Object, and turned to another that had very hollow Eyes and a wrinkled Face, which flouri&s;hed in all the Bloom of Fifteen. The Whitene&s;s of the Lilly was blended in it with the Blu&s;h of the Ro&s;e. He mi&s;took it for a very whim&s;ical kind of Ma&s;que; but upon a nearer View he found that &s;he held her Vizard in her Hand, and that what he &s;aw was only her natural Countenance, touched up with the u&s;ual Improvements of an aged Coquette.</P>
<P>The next who &s;hew'd her &s;elf was a Female Quaker, &s;o very pretty, that he could not forbear licking his Lips, and &s;aying to the Mob about him, <HI>'Tis ten thou&s;and Pities &s;he is not a Church-Woman.</HI> The Quaker was followed by half a dozen Nuns, who filed off one after another up <HI>Catherine-&s;treet,</HI> to their re&s;pective Convents in <HI>Drury-lane.</HI></P>
<P>The 'Squire ob&s;erving the Preci&s;ene&s;s of their Dre&s;s, began now to imagine after all, that this was a Ne&s;t of Sectaries; for he had often heard that the Town was full of them. He was confirmed in this Opinion upon &s;eeing a Conjurer, whom he gue&s;s'd to be the Holder-forth. However, to &s;atisfie him&s;elf he asked a Porter, who &s;tood next him, What Religion the&s;e People were of? The Porter reply'd, <HI>They are of no Religion; 'tis a Ma&s;querade.</HI> Upon that, &s;ays my Friend, I began to &s;moak that they were a Parcel of Mummers; and being him&s;elf one of the Quorum in his own County,
<PB N="256" REF="275">
could not but wonder that none of the <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Ju&s;tices took Care to lay &s;ome of them by the Heels. He was the more provoked in the Spi|rit of Magi&s;tracy, upon di&s;covering two very un&s;eemly Objects: The fir&s;t was a Judge, who rapp'd out a great Oath at his Footman; and the other a big belly'd Woman, who upon ta|king a Leap into the Coach, mi&s;carry'd of a Cu|&s;hion. What &s;till gave him greater Offence was a drunken Bi&s;hop, who reeled from one &s;ide of the Court to the other, and was very &s;weet up|on an <HI>Indian</HI> Queen. But his Wor&s;hip, in the mid&s;t of his Au&s;terity, was mollify'd at the Sight of a very lovely Milk-maid, whom he began to regard with an Eye of Mercy, and conceived a particular Affection for her, 'till he found to his great Amazement, that the Standers by &s;u|&s;pected her to be a Dutche&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude this Narrative without mentioning one Di&s;a&s;ter which happened to my Friend on this Occa&s;ion. Having for his better Convenience di&s;mounted, and mixed among the Crowd, he found upon his Arrival at the Inn, that he had lo&s;t his Pur&s;e and his Alma|nack. And though 'tis no Wonder &s;uch a Trick &s;hould be played him by &s;ome of the curious Spectators, he cannot beat it out of his Head, but that it was a Cardinal who picked his Poc|ket, and that this Cardinal was a Presbyterian in Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>

<Q>Nimium Ri&s;us pretium e&s;t &s;i Probitatis impendio con&s;tat. </Q>
<BIBL>Quintil.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Have lately read with much Plea&s;ure, the E&s;&s;ays upon &s;everal Subjects publi&s;hed by Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>; and though I agree with him in many of his excellent Ob&s;ervations, I cannot but take that rea&s;onable Freedom, which he him|&s;elf makes u&s;e of, with regard to other Writers, to di&s;&s;ent from him in &s;ome few particulars. In his Reflections upon Works of Wit and Hu|mour, he ob&s;erves how unequal they are to combat Vice and Folly; and &s;eems to think, that the fine&s;t Raillery and Satyr, though di|rected by the&s;e generous Views, never reclaim|ed one vicious Man, or made one Fool depart from his Folly.</P>
<P>This is a Po&s;ition very hard to be contradict|ed, becau&s;e no Author knows the Number or Names of his Converts. As for the <HI>Tatlers</HI> and <HI>Spectators</HI> in particular, which are obliged to this ingenious and u&s;eful Author for the Character he has given of them, they were &s;o generally di&s;per&s;ed in &s;ingle Sheets, and have &s;ince been printed in &s;o great Numbers, that it is to be hoped they have made &s;ome Pro&s;elytes to the Intere&s;ts, if not to the Practice of Wi&s;dom and Virtue, among &s;uch a Multitude of Readers.</P>
<P>I need not remind this learned Gentleman, that <HI>Socrates,</HI> who was the greate&s;t Propagator of Morality in the Heathen World, and a Martyr
<PB N="258" REF="277">
for the Unity of the Godhead, was &s;o famous for the Exerci&s;e of this Talent among the po|lite&s;t People of Antiquity, that he gained the Name of (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) <HI>the Drole.</HI></P>
<P>There are very good Effects which vi&s;ibly a|ro&s;e from the above-mentioned Performances and others of the like Nature; as, in the fir&s;t Place, they diverted Raillery from improper Ob|jects, and gave a new Turn to Ridicule, which for many Years had been exerted on Per&s;ons and Things of a &s;acred and &s;erious Nature. They endeavoured to make Mirth in&s;tructive, and if they failed in this great End they mu&s;t be al|lowed at lea&s;t to have made it Innocent. If Wit and Humour begin again to relap&s;e into their former Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they can never hope for Approbation from tho&s;e who know that Raillery is U&s;ele&s;s when it has no Moral under it, and Pernicious when it attacks any thing that is either unblameable or prai&s;e-wor|thy. To this we may add, what has been commonly ob&s;erved, that it is not difficult to be merry on the &s;ide of Vice, as &s;erious Ob|jects are the mo&s;t capable of Ridicule; as the Party, which naturally favour &s;uch a Mirth, is the mo&s;t numerous; and as there are the mo&s;t &s;tand|ing Je&s;ts and Patterns for Imitation in this kind of Writing.</P>
<P>In the next Place: Such Productions of Wit and Humour, as have a Tendency to expo&s;e Vice and Folly, furni&s;h u&s;eful Diver&s;ions to all kinds of Readers. The good, or prudent Man may, by the&s;e Means, be diverted, without Prejudice to his Di&s;cretion, or Morality. Rail|lery under &s;uch Regulations, unbends the Mind from &s;erious Studies and &s;everer Contempla|tions, without throwing it off from its proper
<PB N="259" REF="278">
Bya&s;s. It carries on the &s;ame De&s;ign that is promoted by Authors of a graver Turn, and only does it in another manner. It al&s;o awa|kens Reflection in tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t indif|ferent in the Cau&s;e of Virtue or Knowlege, by &s;etting before them the Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch Prac|tices as are generally unob&s;erved, by rea&s;on of their being Common or Fa&s;hionable: Nay, it &s;ometimes catches the Di&s;&s;olute and Abandon|ed before they are aware of it; who are often betrayed to laugh at them&s;elves, and upon Re|flection find, that they are merry at their own Expence. I might farther take Notice, that by Entertainments of this Kind, a Man may be cheerful in Solitude, and not be forced to &s;eek for Company every Time he has a Mind to be merry.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Advantage I &s;hall mention from Compo&s;itions of this Nature, when thus re|&s;trained, is, that they &s;hew Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue are far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with Polite|ne&s;s and good Humour. They make Mora|lity appear amiable to People of gay Di&s;po|&s;itions, and refute the common Objection a|gain&s;t Religion, which repre&s;ents it as only fit for gloomy and melancholy Tempers. It was the Motto of a Bi&s;hop very eminent for his Piety and good Works in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, <HI>In&s;ervi Deo et Laetare, Serve God and be cheerful.</HI> Tho&s;e therefore who &s;up|ply the World with &s;uch Entertainments of Mirth as are in&s;tructive, or at lea&s;t harmle&s;s, may be thought to de&s;erve well of Mankind; to which I &s;hall only add, that they retrieve the Honour of polite Learning, and an&s;wer tho&s;e &s;ower Enthu&s;ia&s;ts who affect to &s;tigmatize the &s;ine&s;t and mo&s;t elegant Authors, both ancient
<PB N="260" REF="279">
and modern, (which they have never read) as dan|gerous to Religion, and de&s;tructive of all &s;ound and &s;aving Knowledge.</P>
<P>Our Nation are &s;uch Lovers of Mirth and Humour, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for detached Pa|pers, which come out on &s;tated Days, either to have a general Run, or long Continuance, if they are not diver&s;ify'd, and enlivened from Time to Time, with Subjects and Thoughts, accommodated to this Ta&s;te, which &s;o prevails among our Countreymen. No Periodical Au|thor, who always maintains his Gravity, and does not &s;ometimes &s;acrifice to the Graces, mu&s;t expect to keep in vogue for any con&s;ide|rable Time. Political Speculations in parti|cular, however Ju&s;t and Important, are of &s;o dry and au&s;tere a Nature, that they will not go down with the Publick without frequent Sea|&s;onings of this Kind. The Work may be well performed, but will never take, if it is not &s;et off with proper Scenes and Decorations. A mere Politician is but a dull Companion, and, if he is always wi&s;e, is in great Danger of being tire&s;ome or ridiculous.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Papers of Entertainment are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the Number of Readers, e|&s;pecially among tho&s;e of different Notions and Principles; who by this Means may be betray'd to give you a fair Hearing, and to know what you have to &s;ay for your &s;elf. I might likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that in all political Writings there is &s;omething that grates upon the Mind of the mo&s;t candid Reader, in Opi|nions which are not conformable to his own Way of thinking; and that the Har&s;hne&s;s of Rea&s;oning is not a little &s;oftned and &s;moothed by the Infu&s;ions of Mirth and Plea&s;antry.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="280">
Political Speculations do likewi&s;e furni&s;h us with &s;everal Objects that may very innocently be ridiculed, and which are regarded as &s;uch by Men of Sen&s;e in all Parties; of this Kind are the Pa&s;&s;ions of our States-women, and the Rea&s;on|ings of our Fox-hunters.</P>
<P>A Writer who makes Fame the chief End of his Endeavours, and would be more de&s;irous of plea&s;ing than of improving his Readers, might find an inexhau&s;tible Fund of Mirth in Politicks. Scandal and Satyr are never-failing Gratifications to the Publick. Detraction and Obloquy are received with as much Eagerne&s;s as Wit and Humour. Should a Writer &s;ingle out particular Per&s;ons, or point his Raillery at any Order of Men, who by their Profe&s;&s;ion ought to be exempt from it; &s;hould be &s;lander the Innocent, or &s;atyrize the Mi&s;erable; or &s;hould he, even on the proper Subjects of De|ri&s;ion, give the full Play to his Mirth, without regard to Decency and good Manners; he might be &s;ure of plea&s;ing a great Part of his Readers, but mu&s;t be a very ill Man, if by &s;uch a Proceeding he could plea&s;e him&s;elf.</P>

gives us a Pro&s;pect, which the <HI>Romans</HI> wanted under the Reign of their <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> of his being &s;ucceeded by an Heir, both to his Virtues and his Dominions. In the mean Time it happens ve|ry luckily, for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a new Race of Kings upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, that the fir&s;t of this Royal Line has all tho&s;e high Qualifica|tions which are nece&s;&s;ary to fix the Crown up|on his own Head, and to tran&s;mit it to his Po|&s;terity. We may indeed ob&s;erve, that every Series of Kings who have kept up the Succe&s;|&s;ion in their re&s;pective Families, in &s;pite of all Preten&s;ions and Oppo&s;itions formed again&s;t them, has been headed by Princes famous for Valour and Wi&s;dom.

As for King <HI>James</HI> I. the Founder of the <HI>Stuart</HI> Race, had he been as well turned for the Camp, as the Cabi|net, and not confined all his Views to the Peace and Tranquillity of his own Reign, his Son had not been involved in &s;uch fatal Troubles and Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Were an hone&s;t <HI>Briton</HI> to wi&s;h for a Soveraign, who in the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs would be mo&s;t capable of advancing our national Happi|ne&s;s, what could he de&s;ire more than a Prince mature in Wi&s;dom and Experience; renowned for his Valour and Re&s;olution; &s;ucce&s;sful and fortunate in his Undertakings; zealous for the Reformed Religion; related or allied to all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Prote&s;tant Powers of <HI>Europe</HI>; and ble&s;t with a numerous I&s;&s;ue! A Failure in any one of the&s;e Particulars has been the Cau&s;e of in|finite Calamities to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation; but when they all thus happily concur in the &s;ame Per&s;on, they are as much as can be &s;ugge&s;ted, even by

<P>I &s;hall not attempt a Character of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, having already given an imperfect Sketch of it in my &s;econd Paper; but &s;hall chu&s;e rather to ob&s;erve that cruel Treatment which this excellent Prince has met with from the Tongues and Pens of &s;ome of his di&s;affect|ed Subjects.

<P>Fir&s;t, that it reflects highly upon the good Sen&s;e of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, who do not know how to &s;et a ju&s;t Value upon a Prince, who&s;e Virtues have gained him the univer&s;al E&s;teem of foreign Countries.

Mankind, if we are the only People of <HI>Europe</HI> who derogate from his Merit, that may be made happy by it! and, if in a Kingdom which is grown glorious by the Reputation of &s;uch a Soveraign, there are Multitudes who would endeavour to le&s;&s;en and undervalue it.</P>
<P>In the next Place; &s;uch a Treatment from any part of our Fellow-Subjects, is by no means an&s;werable to what we receive from His Ma|je&s;ty. His Love and Regard for our Con&s;titu|tion is &s;o remarkable, that, as we are told by tho&s;e who&s;e Office it is to lay the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation before him, it is his fir&s;t Que&s;tion, upon any Matter of the lea&s;t Doubt or Difficulty, whether it be in every Point according to the Laws of the Land? He is ea&s;y of Acce&s;s to tho&s;e who de&s;ire it, and is &s;o gracious in his Behavi|our and Conde&s;cen&s;ion on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that none of his Subjects retire from his Pre&s;ence without the greate&s;t Idea of his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. His continued Application to &s;uch publick Affairs as may conduce to the Benefit of his Kingdoms, diverts him from tho&s;e Plea|&s;ures and Entertainments which may be indul|ged by Per&s;ons in a lower Station, and are pur|&s;ued with Eagerne&s;s by Princes who have not the Care of the Publick &s;o much at Heart. The lea&s;t Return, which we can make to &s;uch a Soveraign, is that Tribute which is always paid by hone&s;t Men, and is always acceptable to great Minds, the Prai&s;e and Approbation that are due to a virtuous and noble Character. Common Decency forbids opprobrious Lan|guage, even to a bad Prince; and common Ju|&s;tice will exact from us, towards a good Prince, the &s;ame Benevolence and Humanity with which he treats his Subjects. Tho&s;e who are influen|ced
<PB N="266" REF="285">
by Duty and Gratitude, will ri&s;e much higher in all the Expre&s;&s;ions of Affection and Re&s;pect, and think they can never do too much to advance the Glory of a Soveraign, who takes &s;o much Pains to advance their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When we have a King, who has gain'd the Reputation of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;h'd Probity and Honour, and has been fam'd, through the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, for an inviolable Adherence to his Promi&s;es, we may acquie&s;ce (after his many &s;olemn Declarations) in all tho&s;e Mea|&s;ures which it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to judge right|ly of, unle&s;s we were let into &s;uch Schemes of Council and Intelligence as produce them; and therefore we &s;hould rather turn our Thoughts upon the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of his Proceedings, than bu&s;y our &s;elves to form Objections again&s;t them. The Con&s;ideration of His Maje&s;ty'd Character &s;hould at all Times &s;uppre&s;s our Cen&s;ure of his Conduct: And &s;ince we have never yet &s;een, or heard of any fal&s;e Steps in his Behaviour, we ought in Ju&s;tice to think, that he governs him&s;elf by his u&s;ual Rules of Wi&s;dom and Honour, 'till we di&s;cover &s;ome|thing to the contrary.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations ought to reconcile to His Maje&s;ty the Hearts and Tongues of all His People: But as for tho&s;e who are the ob&s;tinate, irreclaimable, profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to our pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, we mu&s;t expect their Calumnies will not only continue, but ri&s;e again&s;t him in proportion as he pur&s;ues &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and ought to recom|mend him to his People.</P>

<P>I Que&s;tion not but mo&s;t of my Readers will be very well plea&s;ed to hear, that my Friend the Fox-hunter, of who&s;e Arrival in Town, I gave Notice in my 44^t^h Paper, is become a Convert to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, and a good Subject to King <HI>GEORGE.</HI> The Motives to his Con|ver&s;ion &s;hall be the Subject of this Paper, as they may be of u&s;e to other Per&s;ons who labour un|der tho&s;e Prejudices and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which hung &s;o long upon the Mind of my worthy Friend. The&s;e I had an Opportunity of learn|ing the other Day, when, at his Reque&s;t, we took a Ramble together to &s;ee the Curio&s;ities of this great Town.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Circum&s;tance, as he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed to me (while we were in the Coach together) which helped to di&s;abu&s;e him, was &s;eeing King <HI>Charles</HI> I. on Hor&s;eback, at <HI>Cha|ring-Cro&s;s</HI>; for he was &s;ure that Prince could never have kept his Seat there, had the Stories been true he had heard in the Countrey, that <HI>Forty One</HI> was come about again.</P>
<P>He owned to me that he looked with Hor|ror on the new Church that is half built in the <HI>Strand,</HI> as taking it at fir&s;t &s;ight to be half de|moli&s;hed: But upon enquiring of the Work|men, was agreeably &s;urprized to find, that in|&s;tead of pulling it down, they were building it
<PB N="268" REF="287">
up; and that Fifty more were rai&s;ing in other Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I mu&s;t add a third Circum&s;tance, which I find had no &s;mall Share in my Friend's Conver&s;ion. Since his coming to Town, he chanced to look into the Church of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> about the middle of Sermon-time, where ha|ving fir&s;t examined the Dome, to &s;ee if it &s;tood &s;afe, (for the Screw-Plot &s;till ran in his Head) he ob&s;erved, that the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and City Sword were a part of the Congrega|tion. This Sight had the more Weight with him, as by good Luck not above two of that Venerable Body were fallen a-&s;leep.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e held us till we came to the Tower; for our fir&s;t Vi&s;it was to the Lions. My Friend, who had a great deal of Talk with their Keeper, enquired very much after their Health, and whether none of them had fallen &s;ick upon the taking of <HI>Perth,</HI> and the Flight of the <HI>Pretender</HI>? and hearing they were never better in their Lives, I found he was extremely &s;tartled: For he had learned from his Cradle, that the Lions in the Tower were the be&s;t Judg|es of the Title of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings, and al|ways &s;ympathized with our Soveraigns.</P>
<P>After having here &s;atiated our Curio&s;ity, we repaired to the <HI>Monument,</HI> where my Fellow-Traveller, being a well-breathed Man, mount|ed the A&s;cent with much Speed and Activity. I was forced to halt &s;o often in this perpendicu|lar March, that, upon my joining him on the Top of the Pillar, I found he had counted all the Steeples and Towers which were di&s;cernible from this advantageous Situation, and was en|deavouring to compute the Number of Acres
<PB N="269" REF="288">
they &s;tood upon. We were both of us very well plea&s;ed with this part of the Pro&s;pect; but I found he ca&s;t an evil Eye upon &s;everal Ware|hou&s;es, and other Buildings, that looked like Barns, and &s;eemed capable of receiving great Multitudes of People. His Heart mi&s;gave him that the&s;e were &s;o many Meeting-Hou&s;es, but, upon communicating his Su&s;picions to me, I &s;oon made him ea&s;y in this particular.</P>
<P>We then turned our Eyes upon the River, which gave me an Occa&s;ion to in&s;pire him with &s;ome favourable Thoughts of Trade and Mer|chandize, that had fill'd the <HI>Thames</HI> with &s;uch Crowds of Ships, and covered the Shore with &s;uch Swarms of People.</P>
<P>We de&s;cended very lei&s;urely, my Friend be|ing careful to count the Steps, which he regi|&s;ter'd in a blank Leaf of his new Almanack. Upon our coming to the bottom, ob&s;erving an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> In&s;cription upon the Ba&s;is, he read it over &s;everal Times, and told me he could &s;carce believe his own Eyes, for that he had often heard from an old Attorney, who lived near him in the Countrey, that it was the Presbyterians who burned down the City; whereas, &s;ays he, this Pillar po&s;itively affirms in &s;o many Words, that <HI>the burning of this ancient City was begun and carried on by the Treachery and Malice of the Po|pi&s;h Faction, in order to the carrying on their hor|rid Plot for extirpating the Prote&s;tant Religion, and old</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Liberty and introducing Popery and Slavery.</HI> This Account, which he looked upon to be more authentick, than if it had been in Print, I found, made a very great Impre&s;&s;ion upon him.</P>
<P>We now took Coach again, and made the be&s;t of our Way for the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> though I
<PB N="270" REF="289">
found he did not much care to venture him&s;elf into the Throng of that Place; for he told me he had heard they were, generally &s;peaking, Re|publicans, and was afraid of having his Pocket pick'd among&s;t them. But he &s;oon conceived a better Opinion of them, when he &s;pied the Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;tanding up in the mid|dle of the Crowd, and mo&s;t of the Kings in <HI>Ba|ker</HI>'s Chronicle ranged in order over their Heads; from whence he very ju&s;tly concluded, that an Antimonarchical A&s;&s;embly could never chu&s;e &s;uch a Place to meet in once a Day.</P>
<P>To continue this good Di&s;po&s;ition in my Friend, after a &s;hort &s;tay at <HI>Stocks Market,</HI> we drove away directly for the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> where he was not a little edified with the Sight of tho&s;e fine Sets of Hor&s;es which have been brought over from <HI>Hanover,</HI> and with the Care that is taken of them. He made many good Remarks upon this Occa&s;ion, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with his Company, that I had much ado to get him out of the Stable.</P>
<P>In our Progre&s;s to St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park</HI> (for that was the end of our Journey) he took Notice, with great Satisfaction, that, contrary to his In|telligence in the Countrey, the Shops were all open and full of Bu&s;ine&s;s; that the Soldiers walked civilly in the Streets; that Clergymen, in&s;tead of being affronted, had generally the Wall given them; and that he had heard the Bells ring to Prayers from Morning to Night, in &s;ome Part of the Town or another.</P>
<P>As he was full of the&s;e hone&s;t Reflections, it happened very luckily for us that one of the King's Coaches pa&s;&s;ed by with the three young Prince&s;&s;es in it, whom by an accidental Stop we had an Opportunity of &s;urveying for &s;ome
<PB N="271" REF="290">
Time: My Friend was ravi&s;hed with the Beau|ty, Innocence, and Sweetne&s;s, that appeared in all their Faces. He declared &s;everal Times that they were the fine&s;t Children he had ever &s;een in all his Life; and a&s;&s;ured me that, before this Sight, if any one had told him it had been po&s;|&s;ible for three &s;uch pretty Children to have been born out of <HI>England,</HI> he &s;hould never have be|lieved them.</P>
<P>We were now walking together in the Park, and as it is u&s;ual for Men who are naturally warm and heady, to be tran&s;ported with the greate&s;t Flu&s;h of Good-nature when they are once &s;weetened; he owned to me very frankly, he had been much impo&s;ed upon by tho&s;e fal&s;e Accounts of things he had heard in the Coun|trey; and that he would make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s, upon his Return thither, to &s;et his Neighbours right, and give them a more ju&s;t Notion of the pre&s;ent State of Affairs.</P>
<P>What confirm'd my Friend in this excellent Temper of Mind, and gave him an inexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, was a Me&s;&s;age he received, as we were walking together, from the Pri&s;oner, for whom he had given his Te&s;timony in his late Tryal. This Per&s;on having been condemned for his Part in the late Rebellion, &s;ent him word that His Maje&s;ty had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to Reprieve him, with &s;everal of his Friends, in order, as it was thought, to give them their Lives; and that he hoped before he went out of Town they &s;hould have a cheerful Meeting, and drink Health and Pro&s;perity to King <HI>George.</HI></P>

<P>THE Condition of a Mini&s;ter of State is on|ly &s;uited to Per&s;ons, who, out of a Love to their King and Countrey, de&s;ire rather to be u&s;eful to the Publick, than ea&s;y to them&s;elves. When a Man is po&s;ted in &s;uch a Station, what|ever his Behaviour may be, he is &s;ure, be&s;ide the natural Fatigue and Trouble of it to incur the Envy of &s;ome, and the Di&s;plea&s;ure of others; as he will have many Rivals, who&s;e Ambition he cannot &s;atisfy, and many Dependents who&s;e Wants he cannot provide for. The&s;e are Mis|fortunes in&s;eparable from &s;uch publick Employ|ments in all Countries; but there are &s;everal o|thers which hang upon this Condition of Life in our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, more than any other Soveraignty in <HI>Europe:</HI> As in the fir&s;t Place, there is no other Nation which is &s;o equally di|vided into two oppo&s;ite Parties, whom it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e at the &s;ame Time. Our No|tions of the publick Good, with relation both to our &s;elves and Foreigners, are of &s;o different a Nature, that tho&s;e Mea&s;ures which are extol|led by one half of the Kingdom, are naturally decryed by the other. Be&s;ides, that in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admini&s;tration, many Acts of Government are
<PB N="273" REF="292">
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in which one of the Par|ties mu&s;t be favoured and obliged, in oppo&s;ition to their Antagoni&s;ts. So that the mo&s;t perfect Admini&s;tration, conducted by the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate Wi&s;dom and Probity, mu&s;t unavoidably produce Oppo&s;ition, Enmity, and Defamation, from Multitudes who are made happy by it.</P>
<P>Farther, It is peculiarly ob&s;erved of our Na|tion, that almo&s;t every Man in it is a Politician, and hath a Scheme of his own, which he thinks preferable to that of any other Per&s;on. Whether this may proceed from that Spirit of Liberty which reigns among us, or from tho&s;e great Numbers of all Ranks and Conditions, who from Time to Time are concerned in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature, and by that Means are let into the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Nation, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. But for this Rea&s;on it is certain, that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try mu&s;t expect to meet with many Cen&s;urers, even in their own Party, and ought to be &s;atisfied, if, allowing to every parti|cular Man that his private Scheme is wi&s;e&s;t, they can per&s;uade him that next to his own Plan that of the Government is the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, We have a Set of very hone&s;t and well-meaning Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> not to be met with in other Countries, who take it for granted, they can never be in the wrong, &s;o long as they oppo&s;e Mini&s;ters of State. Tho&s;e, whom they have admired through the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives for their Honour and Integrity, though they &s;till per&s;i&s;t to act in their former Cha|racter, and change nothing but their Stations, appear to them in a di&s;advantageous Light, as &s;oon as they are placed upon State-Eminences. Many of the&s;e Gentlemen have been u&s;ed to think there is a kind of Slavery in concurring with
<PB N="274" REF="293">
the Mea&s;ures of Great Men, and that the Good of the Countrey is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Incli|nations of the Court: By the Strength of the&s;e Prejudices, they are apt to fancy a Man lo&s;es his Hone&s;ty, from the very Moment that it is made the mo&s;t capable of being u&s;eful to the Publick; and will not con&s;ider that it is every whit as honourable to a&s;&s;i&s;t a good Mini&s;ter, as to oppo&s;e a bad one.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, We may ob&s;erve, that there are greater Numbers of Per&s;ons who &s;olicit for Places, and perhaps are fit for them, in our own Countrey, than in any other. To which we mu&s;t add, That, by the Nature of our Con&s;titu|tion, it is in the Power of more particular Per|&s;ons in this Kingdom, than in any other, to di|&s;tre&s;s the Government when they are di&s;obliged. A <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter mu&s;t therefore expect to &s;ee many of tho&s;e Friends and Dependents fall off from him, whom he cannot gratify in their De|mands upon him; &s;ince, to u&s;e the Phra&s;e of a late State&s;man, who knew very well how to form a Party, <HI>The Pa&s;ture is not large enough.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Whole: The Condition of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter labours under &s;o many Difficulties, that we find in almo&s;t every Reign &s;ince the Con|que&s;t, the chief Mini&s;ters have been New Men, or &s;uch as have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the greate&s;t Po&s;ts in the Government, from the State of pri|vate Gentlemen. Several of them neither ro&s;e from any Con&s;picuous Family, nor left any be|hind them, being of that Cla&s;s of eminent Per|&s;ons, whom Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> &s;peaks of, who, like Comets or blazing Stars, draw upon them the whole Attention of the Age in which they ap|pear, though no Body knows whence they came, not where they are lo&s;t. Per&s;ons of Hereditary
<PB N="275" REF="294">
Wealth and Title have not been over forward to engage in &s;o great a Scene of Cares and Per|plexities, nor to run all the Ri&s;ques of &s;o dangerous a Situation. Nay, many who&s;e Greatne&s;s and Fortune were not made to their Hands, and had &s;ufficient Qualifications and Opportunities of ri|&s;ing to the&s;e high Po&s;ts of Tru&s;t and Honour, have been deterred from &s;uch Pur&s;uits by the Difficulties that attend them, and cho&s;e rather to be Ea&s;ie than Powerful; or, if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, to be Carried in the Chariot than to Drive it.</P>
<P>As the Condition of a Mini&s;ter of State in ge|neral is &s;ubject to many Burthens and Vexati|ons; and as that of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter in particu|lar is involved in &s;everal Hazards and Difficul|ties peculiar to our own Countrey: &s;o is this high Station expo&s;ed more than ordinary to &s;uch Inconveniencies in the pre&s;ent Juncture of Af|fairs; fir&s;t, as it is the beginning of a new E&s;ta|bli&s;hment among us; and &s;econdly, as this E&s;ta|bli&s;hment hath been di&s;turbed by a dangerous Rebellion.</P>
<P>If we look back into our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, we &s;hall always find the fir&s;t Monarch of a new Line received with the greate&s;t Oppo&s;ition, and reconciling to him&s;elf by Degrees the Duty and Affection of his People. The Government, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, is always &s;haken before it &s;ettles. The Inveteracy of the Peoples Prejudices, and the Artifices of dome&s;tick Enemies, compelled their Rulers to make u&s;e of all Means for re|ducing them to their Allegiance, which perhaps, after all was brought about rather by Time than by Policy. When Commotions and Di&s;turban|ces are of an extraordinary and unu&s;ual Nature, the Proceedings of the Government mu&s;t be &s;o
<PB N="276" REF="295">
too. The Remedy mu&s;t be &s;uited to the Evil, and I know no Juncture more difficult to a Mi|ni&s;ter of State, than &s;uch as requires uncommon Methods to be made u&s;e of; when at the &s;ame Time no others can be made u&s;e of, than what are pre&s;cribed by the known Laws of our Con|&s;titution. Several Mea&s;ures may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Juncture, which may be repre|&s;ented as hard and &s;evere, and would not be pro|per in a Time of publick Peace and Tranquillity. In this Ca&s;e <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Excu&s;e, which he puts in the Mouth of a fictitious Sovereign upon a Com|plaint of this Nature, hath the utmo&s;t force of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice on its Side.<Q><P>Res dura et regni Novitas me talia cogunt.</P><P>The Difficulties I meet with in the beginning of my Reign make &s;uch a Proceeding nece&s;&s;ary.</P></Q></P>
<P>In the next Place: As this E&s;tabli&s;hment has been di&s;turbed by a dangerous Rebellion, the Mini&s;try has been involved in many additional and &s;upernumerary Difficulties. It is a common Remark, that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters never fare &s;o well as in a Time of War with a foreign Power, which diverts the private Feuds and Animo&s;ities of the Nation, and turns their Efforts upon the common Enemy. As a foreign War is favou|rable to a Mini&s;try, a Rebellion is no le&s;s dan|gerous; if it &s;ucceeds, they are the fir&s;t Per&s;ons who mu&s;t fall a Sacrifice to it; if it is defeated, they naturally become odious to all the &s;ecret Favourers and Abettors of it. Every Method they make u&s;e of for preventing or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, and for deterring others from the like Practices for the future, mu&s;t be unacceptable and di&s;plea|&s;ing
<PB N="277" REF="296">
to the Friends, Relations and Accomplices of the Guilty. In Ca&s;es where it is thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make Examples, it is the Humour of the Multitude to forget the Crime and re|member the Puni&s;hment. However, we have already &s;een, and &s;till hope to &s;ee, &s;o many In|&s;tances of Mercy in his Maje&s;ty's Government, that our chief Mini&s;ters have more to fear from the Murmurs of their too violent Friends, than from the Reproaches of their Enemies.</P>

<P>YE&s;terday was &s;et apart as a Day of Publick Thank&s;giving for the late extraordinary Succe&s;&s;es, which have &s;ecured to us every Thing that can be e&s;teemed, and delivered us from eve|ry Thing that can be apprehended, by a Prote|&s;tant and a Free People. I cannot but ob&s;erve, upon this Occa&s;ion, the natural Tendency in &s;uch a National Devotion, to in&s;pire Men with Sentiments of religious Gratitude, and to &s;well their Hearts with inward Tran&s;ports of Joy and Exultation.</P>
<P>When In&s;tances of Divine Favour, are great in them&s;elves, when they are fre&s;h upon the Me|mory, when they are peculiar to a certain Coun|trey, and commemorated by them in large and &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies; A Man mu&s;t be of a very cold or degenerate Temper, who&s;e Heart doth not burn within him in the mid&s;t of that Prai&s;e
<PB N="278" REF="297">
and Adoration, which ari&s;es at the &s;ame Hour in all the different Parts of the Nation, and from the many Thou&s;ands of the People.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to read of Extraordinary and National Acts of Wor&s;hip, without being warm|ed with the De&s;cription, and feeling &s;ome De|gree of that Divine Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;preads it &s;elf among a joyful and religious Multitude. A Part of that exuberant Devotion, with which the whole A&s;&s;embly rai&s;ed and animated one a|nother, catches a Reader at the greate&s;t Di|&s;tance of Time, and makes him a kind of Sharer in it.</P>
<P>Among all the publick Solemnities of this Nature there is none in Hi&s;tory &s;o glorious as that under the Reign of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> at the De|dication of the Temple. Be&s;ides the great Of|ficers of State, and the Inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> all the Elders and Heads of Tribes, with the whole Body of the People ranged under them, from one end of the Kingdom to the other, were &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it. We may gue&s;s at the prodigious Number of this A&s;&s;embly from the Sacrifice on which they fea&s;ted, con&s;i&s;ting of a Hundred and Twenty Thou&s;and Sheep, and Two Hundred and Twenty Hecatombs of Oxen. When this va&s;t Congregation was for|med into a regular Proce&s;&s;ion to attend the Ark of the Covenant, the King marched at the Head of his People, with Hymns and Dances to the new Temple, which he had erected for its Re|ception. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Levites</HI> &s;prinkled the Way as they pa&s;&s;ed with the Blood of Sacrifices, and burned the holy Incen&s;e in &s;uch Quantities as refre&s;hed the whole Multitude with its Odours, and filled all the Region about them with Perfume. When the Ark was depo&s;ited

under the Wings of the Cherubims in the holy Place, the great Con&s;ort of Prai&s;e began. It was enlivened with a Hundred and Twenty Trumpets, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a proportionable Num|ber of other kinds of mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and accompanied with innumerable Voices of all the Singers of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who were in&s;tructed and &s;et apart to religious Performances of this kind. As this mighty Chorus was extolling their Ma|ker, and exciting the whole Nation thus a&s;&s;em|bled to the Prai&s;e of his never-cea&s;ing Goodne&s;s and Mercy, the <HI>Shekinah</HI> de&s;cended: Or to tell it in the more emphatical Words of holy Writ, <HI>It came to pa&s;s, as the Trumpets and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard in prai&s;ing and thanking the Lord, and when they lift up their Voice with the Trumpets and Cymbals, and In&s;tru|ments of Mu&s;ick, and prai&s;ed the Lord &s;aying,</HI> For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever; <HI>that then the Hou&s;e was filled with a Cloud.</HI> The Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, not able to bear the Awful|ne&s;s of the Appearance, retired into the Court of the Temple, where the King being placed upon a brazen Scaffold, &s;o as to be &s;een by the whole Multitude, ble&s;&s;ed the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and afterwards, &s;preading forth his Hands to Heaven, offered up that Divine Prayer which is twice recorded at length in Scripture, and has always been looked upon as a Compo&s;ition fit to have proceeded from the wi&s;e&s;t of Men. He had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed his Prayer, when a Fla&s;h of Fire fell from Heaven and burned up the Sacrifice which lay ready upon the Altar. The People, who&s;e Hearts were gradually mo|ved by the Solemnity of the whole Proceeding, having been exalted by the religious Strains of Mu&s;ick, and aw'd by the Appearance of that
<PB N="280" REF="299">
Glory which filled the Temple, &s;eeing now the miraculous Con&s;umption of the Sacrifice, and ob&s;erving the Piety of their King, who lay pro|&s;trate before his Maker, <HI>bowed them&s;elves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Pavement, and wor&s;hipped and prai&s;ed the Lord, &s;aying,</HI> For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</P>
<P>What Happine&s;s might not &s;uch a Kingdom promi&s;e to it&s;elf, where the &s;ame elevated Spi|rit of Religion ran through the Prince, the Prie&s;ts, and the People! But I &s;hall quit this Head, to ob&s;erve that &s;uch an uncommon Fervour of Devotion &s;hewed it&s;elf among our own Coun|treymen, and in the Per&s;ons of three Princes, who were the greate&s;t Conquerors in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory. The&s;e are <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, his Son the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth. As for the fir&s;t, we are told that, before the famous Battel of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y,</HI> he &s;pent the greate&s;t Part of the Night in Prayer, and in the Morning received the Sacrament with his Son, the chief of his Of|ficers, and Nobility. The Night of that glo|rious Day was no le&s;s piou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Orders, which he gave out to his Army, that they &s;hould forbear all in&s;ulting of their E|nemies, or boa&s;ting of their own Valour, and employ their Time in returning Thanks to the great Giver of the Victory. The <HI>Black Prince,</HI> before the Battel of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> declared, that his whole Confidence was in the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and after that great Victory, behaved him&s;elf in all Particulars like a truly Chri&s;tian Conqueror. Eight Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively were appointed by his Father in <HI>England,</HI> for a Solemn and Publick Thank&s;giving; and when the young Prince re|turned in Triumph with a King of <HI>France</HI> as his Pri&s;oner, the Pomp of the Day con&s;i&s;ted chiefly
<PB N="281" REF="300">
in extraordinary Proce&s;&s;ions, and Acts of De|votion. The Behaviour of the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> after a Battel in <HI>Spain,</HI> whereby he re&s;tored the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> to his Dominions, was no le&s;s remarkable. When that King, tran&s;ported with his Succe&s;s, flung him&s;elf upon his Knees to thank him, the generous Prince ran to him, and, taking him by the Hand, told him it was not He who could lay any Claim to his Grati|tude, but de&s;ired they might go to the Altar to|gether, and jointly return their Thanks to whom only it was due.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> V. (who at the Beginning of his Reign, made a publick Prayer in the Pre&s;ence of his Lords and Commons, that he might be cut off by an immediate Death, if Providence fore&s;aw he would not prove a ju&s;t and good Governor, and promote the Welfare of his People) mani|fe&s;tly derived his Courage from his Piety, and was &s;crupulou&s;ly careful not to a&s;cribe the Suc|ce&s;s of it to him&s;elf. When he came within Sight of that prodigious Army, which offered him Battel at <HI>Agincourt,</HI> he ordered all his Ca|valry to di&s;mount, and with the re&s;t of his For|ces, to implore upon their Knees a Ble&s;&s;ing on their Undertaking. In a noble Speech, which he made to his Soldiers immediately before the fir&s;t On&s;et, he took Notice of a very remarka|ble Circum&s;tance, namely, that this very Day of Battel was the Day appointed in his own Kingdom, to offer up publick Devotions for the Pro&s;perity of his Arms, and therefore bid them not doubt of Victory, &s;ince at the &s;ame Time that they were fighting in the Field, all the People of <HI>England</HI> were lifting up their Hands to Heaven for their Succe&s;s. Upon the clo&s;e of that me|morable Day, in which the King had performed
<PB N="282" REF="301">
Wonders wirh his own Hand, he ordered the CXV^t^h P&s;alm to be repeated in the mid&s;t of his victorious Army, and at the Words, <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Prai&s;e,</HI> He him&s;elf, with his whole Ho&s;t, fell to the Earth upon their Faces, a&s;cribing to Omnipotence the whole Glory of &s;o great an Action.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Paper with a Reflection, which naturally ri&s;es out of it. As there is no|thing more beautiful in the Sight of God and Man, than a King and his People concurring in &s;uch extraordinary Acts of Devotion, one cannot &s;uppo&s;e a greater Contradiction and Ab|&s;urdity in a Government, than where the King is of one Religion and the People of another. What Harmony or Corre&s;pondence can be ex|pected between a Soveraign and his Subjects, when they cannot join together in the mo&s;t joy|ful, the mo&s;t &s;olemn, and mo&s;t laudable Action of rea&s;onable Creatures; in a word, where the Prince con&s;iders his People as Hereticks, and the People look upon their Prince as an Idolater!</P>

Chri&s;tianity, he ob&s;erved, had made its way by Rea&s;on and Miracles, but he profe&s;s'd it was his De&s;ign to &s;ave Men by the Sword. From that time he began to knock down his Fellow-Citizens with a great deal of Zeal, to plunder Caravans with a mo&s;t exemplary Sanctity, and to fill all <HI>Arabia</HI> with an unnatural Medly of Religion and Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Enemies of our happy E&s;tabli&s;hment &s;eem at pre&s;ent to copy out the Piety of this &s;e|ditious Prophet, and to have Recour&s;e to his laudable Method of Club Law, when they find all other Means for enforcing the Ab&s;urdity of their Opinions to be ineffectual. It was u&s;ual among the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> for tho&s;e, who had &s;aved the Life of a Citizen, to be dre&s;t in an Oaken Garland; but among us, This has been a Mark of &s;uch well-intentioned Per&s;ons, as would betray their Countrey, if they were able, and beat out the Brains of their Fellow-Sub|jects. Nay, the Leaders of this poor unthink|ing Rabble, to &s;hew their Wit, have lately deck|ed them out of their Kitchen Gardens in a mo&s;t in&s;ipid Pun, very well &s;uited to the Capacity of &s;uch Followers.</P>
<P>This manner of proceeding has had an Ef|fect quite contrary to the Intention of the&s;e in|genious Demagogues: For by &s;etting &s;uch an unfortunate Mark on their Followers, they have expo&s;ed them to innumerable Drubs and Confu&s;ions. They have been cudgell'd mo&s;t

In &s;hort, if we may believe our Accounts both from Town and Countrey, the No&s;es and Ears of the Party are very much di|mini&s;hed, &s;ince they have appeared under this unhappy Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, there is &s;uch an unac|countable Frenzy and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;pread through the ba&s;e&s;t of the People, of all Parties and Denominations, that if their Skirmi&s;hes did not proceed to too great an Extremity, one would not be &s;orry to &s;ee them be&s;towing &s;o liberally, upon one another, a Cha&s;ti&s;ement which they &s;o richly de&s;erve. Their Thumps and Brui&s;es might turn to account, and &s;ave the Government a great deal of Trouble, if they could beat each other into good Manners.</P>
<P>Were not Advice thrown away on &s;uch a thoughtle&s;s Rabble, one would recommend to their &s;erious Con&s;ideration what is &s;u&s;pected, and indeed known, to be the Cau&s;e of the&s;e po|pular Tumults and Commotions in this great City. They are the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, that lie concealed under many Di&s;gui&s;es in all Quar|ters of the Town, who mix them&s;elves in the&s;e dark Scuffles, and animate the Mob to &s;uch mu|tual Outrages and In&s;ults. This profligate Spe|cies of Modern Apo&s;tles divert them&s;elves at the Expence of a Government, which is oppo|&s;ite to their Intere&s;ts, and are plea&s;ed to &s;ee the broken Heads of Hereticks, in what Party &s;oever they have li&s;ted them&s;elves. Their Treatment of our &s;illy Countreymen, puts me in mind of an Account in <HI>Tavernier</HI>'s Travels through the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> This Author tells us, there is a
<PB N="285" REF="304">
great Wood in tho&s;e Parts very plentifully &s;tock|ed with Monkies; that a large High-way runs through the middle of this Wood; and that the Monkies who live on the one Side of this High-way, are declared Enemies to tho&s;e who live on the other. When the Inhabitants of that Coun|trey have a Mind to give them&s;elves a Diver&s;ion, it is u&s;ual for them to &s;et the&s;e poor Animals together by the Ears; which they do after this Manner. They place &s;everal Pots of Rice in the middle of the Road, with great Heaps of Cudgels in the Neighbourhood of every Pot. The Monkies, on the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the&s;e Provi&s;ions, de&s;cend from the Trees on either Side in prodigious Numbers, take up the Arms, with which their good Friends have furni&s;hed them, and belabour one another with a Storm of Thwacks, to the no &s;mall Mirth and Enter|tainment of the Beholders. This Mob of Mon|kies act however &s;o far rea&s;onably in this Point, as the victorious Side of the Wood find, upon the Repul&s;e of their Enemies, a con&s;iderable Booty on the Field of Battel; whereas our Par|ty-Mobs are betrayed into the Fray without any Pro&s;pect of the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>If our common People have not Virtue enough left among them, to lay a&s;ide this wicked and unnatural Hatred which is crept into their Hearts again&s;t one another, nor Sen&s;e enough to re&s;i&s;t the Artifice of tho&s;e Incendiaries, who would animate them to the De&s;truction of their Coun|trey; it is high time for the Government to ex|ert it &s;elf in the repre&s;&s;ing of &s;uch &s;editious Tu|mults and Commotions. If that extraordinary Lenity and Forbearance which has been hitherto &s;hewn on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, proves ineffectual to that Purpo&s;e, the&s;e Mi&s;creants of the Commu|nity

ought to be made &s;en&s;ible, that our Con|&s;titution is armed with a &s;ufficient Force for the Reformation of &s;uch Di&s;orders, and the Settle|ment of the publick Peace.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater Affront to Religion, than &s;uch a tumultuous Ri&s;ing of the People, who di&s;tingui&s;h the Times &s;et apart for the Natio|nal Devotions by the mo&s;t brutal Scenes of Vio|lence, Clamour, and Intemperance. The Day begins with a Thank&s;giving, and ends in a Riot. In&s;tead of the Voice of mutual Joy and Gladne&s;s, there is nothing heard in our Streets but oppro|brious Language, Ribaldry and Contention.</P>
<P>As &s;uch a Practice is &s;candalous to our Religi|on, &s;o it is no le&s;s a Reproach to our Govern|ment. We are become a By-word among the Nations for our ridiculous Feuds and Animo|&s;ities, and fill all the publick Prints of <HI>Europe</HI> with the Accounts of our Mid-night Brawls and Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing to private Per&s;ons from the&s;e vile Di&s;turbers of the Common wealth are too many to be enumerated. The Great and Innocent are in&s;ulted by the Scum and Refu&s;e of the People. Several poor Wretches, who have engaged in the&s;e Commotions, have been di&s;|abled, for their Lives, from doing any Good to their Families and Dependents; nay, &s;everal of them have fallen a Sacrifice to their own in|excu&s;able Folly and Madne&s;s. Should the Go|vernment be wearied out of its pre&s;ent Patience and Forbearance, and forced to execute all tho&s;e Powers with which it is inve&s;ted for the Pre&s;er|vation of the publick Peace; what is to be ex|pected by &s;uch Heaps of turbulent and &s;editious Men!</P>

<P>AS there is nothing which more improves the Mind of Man, than the reading of antient Authors, when it is done with Judgment and Di&s;cretion; &s;o there is nothing which gives a more unlucky Turn to the Thoughts of a Reader, when he wants Di&s;cernment, and loves and ad|mires the Characters and Actions of Men in a wrong Place. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great was &s;o in|flamed with fal&s;e Notions of Glory, by reading the Story of <HI>Achilles</HI> in the Iliad, that after ha|ving taken a Town, he ordered the Governor, who had made a gallant Defence, to be bound by the Feet to his Chariot; and afterwards dragg'd the brave Man round the City, becau&s;e <HI>Hector</HI> had been treated in the &s;ame barbarous manner by his admired Hero.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> have proved very pernicious to their own Countrey, by following blindly the Examples of Per&s;ons to be met with in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, who acted in Conformity with their own Governments, after a quite dif|ferent
<PB N="288" REF="307">
manner, than they would have acted in a Con&s;titution like that of ours. Such a Method of proceeding is as unrea&s;onable in a Politician, as it would be in a Husbandman to make u&s;e of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Precepts of Agriculture, in managing the Soil of our Countrey, that lies in a quite different Climate, and under the Influence of almo&s;t another Sun.</P>
<P>Our Regicides in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t execrable Murder u&s;ed to ju&s;tify them&s;elves from the Conduct of <HI>Brutus,</HI> not con&s;idering that <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> from the Condition of a Fellow-Citizen, had ri&s;en by the mo&s;t indirect Methods, and broken through all the Laws of the Commu|nity, to place him&s;elf at the Head of the Govern|ment, and en&s;lave his Countrey. On the other &s;ide, &s;everal of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Readers, having ob|&s;erved that a Pa&s;&s;ive and Unlimited Obedience was payed to <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, who were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Legi&s;lative, as well as Ex|ecutive Power, have formerly endeavoured to inculcate the &s;ame kind of Obedience, where there is not the &s;ame kind of Authority.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions therefore to be learned from Hi|&s;tories of this Nature, are only &s;uch as ari&s;e from Particulars agreeable to all Communities, or from &s;uch as are common to our own Con&s;titu|tion, and to that of which we read. Atenacious Adherence to the Rights and Liberties tran&s;mit|ted from a wi&s;e and virtuous Ance&s;try, Publick Spirit and a Love of ones Countrey, Submi&s;&s;ion to e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, impartial Admini&s;trations of Ju&s;tice, a &s;trict Regard to National Faith, with &s;everal other Duties, which are the Supports and Ornaments of Government in general, cannot bee too much admired among the States of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> nor too much imitated by our own Community.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="308">
But there is nothing more ab&s;urd, than for Men, who are conver&s;ant in the&s;e Antient Au|thors, to contract &s;uch a Prejudice in favour of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as to fancy we are in the wrong in every Circum&s;tance whereby we de|viate from their Moral or Political Conduct. Yet nothing hath been more u&s;ual, than for Men of warm Heads to refine them&s;elves up into this kind of State-Pedantry: Like the Countrey School-ma&s;ter, who, being u&s;ed for many Years to admire <HI>Jupiter, Mars, Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> that appear with &s;o much Advantage in Cla&s;&s;ick Authors, made an Attempt to revive the Wor|&s;hip of the Heathen Gods. In &s;hort, we find many worthy Gentlemen, who&s;e Brains have been as much turned by this kind of reading, as the grave Knight's of <HI>Mancha</HI> were by his un|wearied Application to Books of Knight-Er|rantry.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs from ari&s;ing out of Studies, which, when rightly conducted, may turn very much to our Advantage, I &s;hall ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that in our peru&s;al of <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, it is impo&s;&s;ible to find a Reli|gious or Civil Con&s;titution, any way compara|ble to that which we enjoy in our own Coun|trey. Had not our Religion been infinitely pre|ferable to that of the antient Heathens, it would never have made its way through Pagani&s;m, with that amazing Progre&s;s and Activity. It's Victories were the Victories of Rea&s;on una&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the Force of human Power, and as gentle as the Triumphs of Light over Darkne&s;s. The &s;udden Reformation which it made among Mankind, and which was &s;o ju&s;tly and frequent|ly boa&s;ted of by the fir&s;t Apologi&s;ts for Chri|&s;tianity, &s;hew how infinitely preferable it is
<PB N="290" REF="309">
to any Sy&s;tem of Religion, that prevailed in the World before its Appearance. This Pre-emi|nence of Chri&s;tianity to any other general Re|ligious Scheme, which preceded it, appears like|wi&s;e from this Particular, that the mo&s;t eminent and the mo&s;t enlightned among the Pagan Phi|lo&s;ophers di&s;claimed many of tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious Follies, which are condemned by revealed Re|ligion, and preached up &s;everal of tho&s;e Do|ctrines which are &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Parts of it.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take Notice of that &s;trange Motive which is made u&s;e of in the Hi|&s;tory of Free-thinking, to incline us to depart from the revealed Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, as adhered to by the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> be|cau&s;e <HI>Socrates,</HI> with &s;everal other eminent <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> with many other learned <HI>Romans,</HI> did in the like Manner depart from the religious Notions of their own Countrey-men. Now this Author &s;hould have con&s;ider'd, that tho&s;e very Points, in which the&s;e wi&s;e Men di&s;agreed from the Bulk of the People, are Points in which they agreed with the received Doctrines of our Nation. Their Free-thinking con&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;ert|ing the Unity and Immateriality of the Godhead, the Immortality of the Soul, a State of future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, and the nece&s;&s;ity of Virtue, exclu&s;ive of all &s;illy and &s;uper&s;titious Practices, to procure the Happine&s;s of a &s;e|parate State. They were therefore only Free-thinkers, &s;o far forth as they approach'd to the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, that is, to tho&s;e very Doctrines which this kind of Authors would per&s;uade us, as Free thinkers, to doubt the Truth of. Now I would appeal to any rea&s;onable Per&s;on, whether the&s;e great Men &s;hould not
<PB N="291" REF="310">
have been propo&s;ed to our Imitation, rather as they embraced the&s;e divine Truths, than only upon the Account of their breaking loo&s;e from the common Notions of their Fellow-Citizens. But this would di&s;appoint the general Tendency of &s;uch Writings.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add under this Head, that as Chri|&s;tianity recovered the Law of Nature out of all tho&s;e Errors and Corruptions, with which it was overgrown in the Times of Pagani&s;m, our National Religion has re&s;tored Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf to that Purity and Simplicity in which it ap|peared, before it was gradually di&s;gui&s;ed and lo&s;t among the Vanities and Super&s;titions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church.</P>
<P>That our Civil Con&s;titution is preferable to any among the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> may appear from this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration; that the greate&s;t Theori&s;ts in Matters of this Nature, among tho&s;e very People have given the Preference to &s;uch a Form of Government, as that which obtains in this Kingdom, above any other Form what&s;oever. I &s;hall mention <HI>Ari&s;totle, Polybi|us</HI> and <HI>Cicero,</HI> that is, the greate&s;t Philo&s;opher, the mo&s;t impartial Hi&s;torian, and the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate State&s;man of all Antiquity. The&s;e famous Authors give the Pre-eminence to a mixt Government con&s;i&s;ting of three Branches, the Regal, the Noble, and the Popular. It would be very ea&s;ie to prove, not only the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of this Po&s;ition, but to &s;hew, that there was never any Con&s;titution among the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> in which the&s;e three Branches were &s;o well di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, inve&s;ted with &s;uch &s;uitable Proportions of Power, and concurred together in the Legi&s;lature, that is, in the mo&s;t &s;overaign Acts of Government, with
<PB N="292" REF="311">
&s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;ent and Harmony, as are to be met with in the Con&s;titution of this King|dom. But I have ob&s;erved, in a foregoing Pa|per, how defective the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth was in this Particular, when compared with our own Form of Government, and it will not be difficult for the Reader, upon &s;ingling out any other ancient State; to find how far it will &s;uffer in the Parallel.</P>

for the Pre&s;ervation of a Government, and ve|ry rea&s;onable in Per&s;ons who are per&s;uaded of the Excellency of their Con&s;titution, and believe that they derive from it the mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;|&s;ings of Society.</P>
<P>This publick-&s;pirited Pa&s;&s;ion is more &s;trong and active under &s;ome Governments, than others. The Commonwealth of <HI>Venice,</HI> which hath &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted by it for near fourteen hundred Years, is &s;o jealous of all its Members, that it keeps conti|nual Spies upon their Actions; and if any one of them pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure the e&s;tabli&s;hed Plan of that Republick, or touch upon any of its Fundamentals, he is brought before a Secret Council of State, tried in a mo&s;t rigorous man|ner, and put to Death without Mercy. The u&s;ual way of proceeding with Per&s;ons who di&s;|cover them&s;elves un&s;atisfied with the Title of their Soveraign in De&s;potick Governments, is to confine the Malecontent, if his Crimes are not Capital, to &s;ome Ca&s;tle or Dungeon for Life. There is indeed no Con&s;titution, &s;o tame and carele&s;s of their own Defence, where any Per|&s;on dares to give the lea&s;t Sign or Intimation of being a Traitour in his Heart. Our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi|&s;tory furni&s;hes us with many Examples of great Severities during the Di&s;putes between the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> inflicted on &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hew'd their Di&s;affection to the Prince who was on the Throne. Every one knows, that a factious Inn-keeper, in the Reign of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the Seventh, was hanged, drawn, and quar|tered for a &s;aucy Pun, which reflected, in a ve|ry dark and di&s;tant manner, upon the Title of that Prince to the Crown. I do not mention the Practice of other Governments, as what &s;hould be imitated in ours, which God be thank|ed,
<PB N="294" REF="313">
affords us all the rea&s;onable Liberty of Speech and Action, &s;uited to a Free People; nor do I take Notice of this la&s;t In&s;tance of Se|verity in our own Countrey, to ju&s;tify &s;uch a Proceeding, but only to di&s;play the Mildne&s;s and Forbearance made u&s;e of under the Reign of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. It may, however, turn to the Advantage of tho&s;e, who have been in|&s;trumental in &s;tirring up the late Tumults and Seditions among the People, to con&s;ider the Treatment which &s;uch a lawle&s;s ungoverned Rabble would have met with in any other Coun|trey, and under any other Soveraign.</P>
<P>The&s;e Incendiaries have had the Art to work up into the mo&s;t unnatural Ferments, the mo&s;t heavy and &s;tupid part of the Community; and, if I may u&s;e a fine Saying of <HI>Terence</HI> upon a|nother Occa&s;ion, <HI>to convert Fools into Madmen.</HI> This Frenzy hath been rai&s;ed among them to &s;uch a degree, that it has lately di&s;covered it &s;elf in a Sedition which is without a Parallel. They have had the Fool-hardine&s;s to &s;et a Mark upon them&s;elves on the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Birth-day, as the declared Friends to his Cau&s;e, and profe&s;t Enemies to their King and Countrey. How fatal would &s;uch a di&s;tinction, of which every one knew the meaning, have proved in former Reigns, when many a Circum&s;tance of le&s;s Significancy has been con&s;trued into an Overt Act of High Trea&s;on! This unexampled Piece of In&s;olence will appear under its ju&s;t Aggrava|tions, if we con&s;ider in the fir&s;t place, that it was aimed per&s;onally at the King.</P>
<P>I do not remember among any of our popu|lar Commotions, when Marks of this Nature have been in Fa&s;hion, that either Side were &s;o void of common Sen&s;e, as to intimate by them
<PB N="295" REF="314">
an Aver&s;ion to their Soveraign. His Per&s;on was &s;till held as &s;acred by both Parties. The Contention was not who &s;hould be the Mo|narch over them, but who&s;e Scheme of Policy &s;hould take Place in his Admini&s;tration. This was the Conduct of Whigs and Tories under King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, when Men hung out their Principles in different coloured Ribbons. Nay, in the Times of the Great Re|bellion, the avowed Di&s;affection of the People always terminated in evil Coun&s;ellors. Such an open Outrage upon Maje&s;ty, &s;uch an O&s;ten|tation of Di&s;loyalty, was re&s;erved for that in|famous Rabble of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who may be ju&s;t|ly looked upon as the Scandal of the pre&s;ent Age, and the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s and abandoned Race of Men that our Nation has yet produced.</P>
<P>In the next Place. It is very peculiar to this Mob of Malecontents, that they did not only di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves again&s;t their King, but a|gain&s;t a King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Power of the Nation, and one who had &s;o very lately cru&s;hed all tho&s;e of the &s;ame Principles, that had Bra|very enough to avow them in the Field of Bat|tel. When ever was there an In&s;tance of a King who was not contemptible for his Weakne&s;s, and want of Power to re&s;ent, in&s;ulted by a few of his unarmed da&s;tard Subjects?</P>
<P>It is plain from this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, that &s;uch a ba&s;e ungenerous Race of Men could rely upon nothing for their Safety in this Affront to His Maje&s;ty, but the known Gentlene&s;s and Lenity of his Government. In&s;tead of being deterred by knowing that he had in his Hands the Power to puni&s;h them, they were encou|raged by knowing that he had not the Inclina|tion. In a word, they pre&s;umed upon that Mer|cy,
<PB N="296" REF="315">
which in all their Conver&s;ations they en|deavour to depreciate and mi&s;repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is a very &s;en&s;ible Concern to every one, who has a true and unfeigned Re&s;pect for our National Religion, to hear the&s;e vile Mi&s;creants calling them&s;elves Sons of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> amid&s;t &s;uch impious Tumults and Di&s;or|ders; and joining in the Cry of High-Church at the &s;ame Time that they wear a Badge, which implies their Inclination to de&s;troy the Reform|ed Religion. Their Concern for the Church al|ways ri&s;es highe&s;t, when they are acting in direct oppo&s;ition to its Doctrines. Our Streets are filled at the &s;ame Time with Zeal and Drunkenne&s;s, Riots and Religion. We mu&s;t confe&s;s, if Noi&s;e and Clamour, Slander and Calumny, Trea&s;on and Perjury, were Articles of their Communi|on, there would be none living more punctu|al in the Performance of their Duties; but if a peaceable Behaviour, a love of Truth, and a Submi&s;&s;ion to Superiors, are the genuine Marks of our Profe&s;&s;ion, we ought to be very heartily a&s;hamed of &s;uch a profligate Brotherhood. Or if we will &s;till think and own the&s;e Men to be true Sons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> I dare &s;ay there is no Church in <HI>Europe</HI> who will envy her the Glory of &s;uch Di&s;ciples. But it is to be hoped we are not &s;o fond of Party, as to look upon a Man, becau&s;e he is a bad Chri&s;tian, to be a good Church of <HI>England</HI> Man.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carce any Man in <HI>England,</HI> of what Denomination &s;oever, that is not a Free-thinker in Politicks, and hath not &s;ome particular Notions of his own, by which he di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf from the re&s;t of the Com|munity. Our I&s;land, which was formerly cal|led a Nation of Saints, may now be called a Nation of State&s;men. Almo&s;t every Age, Profe&s;&s;i|on, and Sex among us, has its Favourite Set of Mini&s;ters, and Scheme of Government.</P>
<P>Our Children are initiated into Factions be|fore they know their Right Hand from their Left. They no &s;ooner begin to &s;peak, but Whig and Tory are the fir&s;t Words they learn. They are taught in their Infancy to hate one half of the Nation; and contract all the Virulence and Pa&s;&s;ion of a Party, before they come to the U&s;e of their Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As for our Nobility, they are Politicians by Birth; and though the Commons of the Na|tion delegate their Power in the Community to certain Repre&s;entatives, every one re&s;erves to him&s;elf a private Juri&s;diction, or Privilege, of cen&s;uring their Conduct, and rectifying the Le|gi&s;lature. There is &s;carce a Fre&s;h-man in either Univer&s;ity, who is not able to mend the Con|&s;titution in &s;everal Particulars. We &s;ee 'Squires and Yeomen coming up to Town every Day, &s;o full of Politicks, that, to u&s;e the Thought of
<PB N="298" REF="317">
an ingenious Gentleman, we are frequently put in mind of <HI>Roman</HI> Dictators, who were called from the Plough. I have often heard of a Se|nior Alderman in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> who, at all publick Meetings, grows drunk in Prai&s;e of A|ri&s;tocracy, and is as often encountered by an old Ju&s;tice of Peace who lives in the Neigh|bourhood, and will talk you from Morning till Night on the <HI>Gothic</HI> Balance. Who hath not ob&s;erved &s;everal Pari&s;h Clerks, that have ran|&s;acked <HI>Hopkins</HI> and <HI>Sternbold</HI> for Staves in fa|vour of the Race of <HI>Jacob</HI>; after the Example of their Politick Predece&s;&s;ors in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Days, who on every Sabbath were for binding Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Links of Iron! You can &s;carce &s;ee a Bench of Porters without two or three Ca&s;ui&s;ts in it, that will &s;ettle you the Right of Princes, and &s;tate the Bounds of the Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, in the drinking of a Pot of Ale. What is more u&s;ual than on a Rejoicing Night to meet with a drunken Cob|ler bawling out for the Church, and perhaps knocked down a little after, by an Enemy in his own Profe&s;&s;ion, who is a Lover of Mode|ration!</P>
<P>We have taken notice in former Papers of this Political Ferment being got into the Female Sex, and of the wild Work it makes among them. We have had a late mo&s;t remarkable In|&s;tance of it in a Conte&s;t between a Si&s;ter of the <HI>White Ro&s;e,</HI> and a beautiful and loyal young La|dy, who to &s;hew her Zeal for Revolution-Principles, had adorned her pretty Bo&s;om with a <HI>Sweet William.</HI> The Rabble of the Sex have not been a&s;hamed very lately to gather about Bonfires, and to &s;cream out their Principles in the Publick Streets. In &s;hort, there is hardly
<PB N="299" REF="318">
a Female in this our Metropolis, who is not a competent Judge of our highe&s;t Controver&s;ies in Church and State. We have &s;everal Oi&s;ter-women that hold the Unlawfulne&s;s of Epi&s;co|pacy; and Cinder wenches that are great Stick|lers for indefea&s;ible Right.</P>
<P>Of all the Ways and Means by which this Po|litical Humour hath been propagated among the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I cannot &s;ingle out a|ny &s;o prevalent and univer&s;al, as the late con|&s;tant Application of the Pre&s;s to the publi&s;hing of State-Matters. We hear of &s;everal that are newly erected in the Countrey, and &s;et apart for this particular U&s;e. For, it &s;eems, the Peo|ple of <HI>Exeter, Salisbury,</HI> and other large Towns, are re&s;olved to be as great Politicians as the In|habitants of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>; and deal out &s;uch News of their own Printing, as is be&s;t &s;uited to the Genius of the Market-People, and the Ta&s;te of the County.</P>
<P>One cannot but be &s;orry, for the &s;ake of the&s;e Places, that &s;uch a pernicious Machine is erect|ed among them; for it is very well known here, that the making of the Politician is the breaking of the Trade&s;man. When a Citizen turns a <HI>Machiavel,</HI> he grows too cunning to mind his own Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I have heard a curious Ob|&s;ervation, that the Woollen Manufacture has of late Years decayed in Proportion as the Paper Manufacture has encrea&s;ed. Whether the one may not properly be looked upon as the Occa|&s;ion of the other, I &s;hall leave to the Judgment of Per&s;ons more profound in political Enquiries.</P>
<P>As our News-writers record many Facts which, to u&s;e their own Phra&s;e, <HI>afford great Matter of Speculation,</HI> their Readers &s;peculate accordingly, and by their variety of Conjectures,
<PB N="300" REF="319">
in a few Years become con&s;ummate State&s;men; be&s;ides, as their Papers are filled with a different Party-Spirit, they naturally divide the People into different Sentiments, who generally con|&s;ider rather the Principles, than the Truth of the News-writer. This Humour prevails to &s;uch a Degree, that there are &s;everal well-mean|ing Per&s;ons in the Nation, who have been &s;o mi&s;led by their favourite Authors of this kind, that in the pre&s;ent Contention between the <HI>Turk</HI> and the Emperor, they are gone over in&s;en&s;ibly from the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity, and become Well-wi&s;hers to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Cau&s;e. In a word, almo&s;t, every News-writer has his Sect, which (con&s;idering the natural Genius of our Countreymen to mix, vary, or refine in No|tions of State) furni&s;hes every Man, by Degrees, with a particular Sy&s;tem of Policy. For, how|ever any one may concur in the general Scheme of his Party, it is &s;till with certain Re&s;erves and Deviations, and with a Salvo to his own pri|vate Judgment.</P>
<P>Among this innumerable Herd of Politicians, I cannot but take Notice of one Sett, who do not &s;eem to play fair with the re&s;t of the Frater|nity, and make a very con&s;iderable Cla&s;s of Men. The&s;e are &s;uch as we may call the <HI>Af|terwi&s;e,</HI> who, when any Project fails, or hath not had its de&s;ired Effect, fore&s;aw all the Incon|veniencies that would ari&s;e from it, though they kept their Thoughts to them&s;elves till they di&s;covered the i&s;&s;ue. Nay, there is nothing more u&s;ual than for &s;ome of the&s;e wi&s;e Men, who applauded publick Mea&s;ures, before they were put in Execution, to condemn them upon their proving un&s;ucce&s;sful. The Dictators in Coffee-hou&s;es are generally of this Rank, who
<PB N="301" REF="320">
often give &s;hrewd Intimations that Things would have taken another Turn, had They been Members of the Cabinet.</P>
<P>How difficult mu&s;t it be for any Form of Go|vernment to continue undi&s;turbed, or any Ru|ler to live uncen&s;ured, where every one of the Community is thus qualified for modelling the Con&s;titution, and is &s;o good a Judge in Matters of State! A famous <HI>French</HI> Wit; to &s;hew how the Monarch of that Nation, who has no Part|ners in his Soveraignty, is better able to make his Way through all the Difficulties of Govern|ment, than an Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> who acts in concert with many inferior Fellow-Sove|raigns; compares the fir&s;t to a Serpent with ma|ny Tails to one Head; and the other to a Ser|pent with one Tail to many Heads; and puts the Que&s;tion, which of them is like to glide with mo&s;t Ea&s;e and Activity through a Thicket? The &s;ame Compari&s;on will hold in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Nation conducted by a Mini&s;try, or a whole Kingdom of Politicians.</P>

<P>THE general Divi&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation is into Whigs and Tories, there being very few, if any, who &s;tand Neuters in the Di&s;pute,
<PB N="302" REF="321">
without ranging them&s;elves under one of the&s;e Denominations. One would therefore be apt to think, that every Member of the Community, who embraces with Vehemence the Principles of either of the&s;e Parties, had thoroughly &s;ifted and examined them, and was &s;ecretly convinced of their Preference to tho&s;e of that Party which he rejects. And yet it is certain, that mo&s;t of our Fellow-Subjects are guided in this particular, ei|ther by the Prejudice of Education, private In|tere&s;t, per&s;onal Friend&s;hips, or a Deference to the Judgment of tho&s;e, who, perhaps in their own Hearts di&s;approve the Opinions which they indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread among the Multitude. Nay, there is nothing more undoubtedly true, than that great Numbers of one &s;ide concur in reality with the Notions of tho&s;e whom they oppo&s;e, were they able to explain their implicit Senti|ments, and to tell their own Meaning.</P>
<P>However, as it becomes every rea&s;onable Man to examine tho&s;e Principles by which he acts, I &s;hall in this Paper &s;elect &s;ome Con&s;iderations, out of many, that might be in&s;i&s;ted on, to &s;hew the Preference of what is generally called the Whig-Scheme, to that which is e&s;pou&s;ed by the Tories.</P>
<P>This will appear in the Fir&s;t place, if we re|flect upon the Tendency of their re&s;pective Prin|ciples, &s;uppo&s;ing them carried to their utmo&s;t Extremity. For if, in this ca&s;e, the wor&s;t Con|&s;equences of the one are more eligible than the wor&s;t Con&s;equences of the other, it is a plain Argument, that tho&s;e Principles are the mo&s;t e|ligible of the two, who&s;e Effects are the lea&s;t pernicious. Now the Tendency of the&s;e two different Sets of Principles, as they are charged upon each Party by its Antagoni&s;ts, is as follows.
<PB N="303" REF="322">
The Tories tell us, that the Whig-Scheme would end in Presbyteriani&s;m and a Common-wealth. The Whigs tell us on the other &s;ide, that the Tory-Scheme would terminate in Popery and Arbitrary Government. Were the&s;e Reproaches mutually true; which would be mo&s;t preferable to any Man of common Sen&s;e, Presbyteriani&s;m and a Republican Form of Government, or Po|pery and Tyranny? Both Extremes are indeed dreadful, but not equally &s;o; both to be regard|ed with the utmo&s;t Aver&s;ion by the Friends of our Con&s;titution, and Lovers of our Countrey: But if one of them were inevitable, who would not rather chu&s;e to live under a State of exce&s;&s;ive Liberty, than of Slavery, and not prefer a Religion that differs from our own in the Cir|cum&s;tantials, before one that differs from it in the E&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity!</P>
<P>Secondly, Let us look into the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and &s;ee under which of the&s;e two Schemes the Nation hath enjoyed mo&s;t Honour and Pro|&s;perity. If we ob&s;erve the Reigns of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> I. (which an impudent <HI>Frenchman</HI> calls the Reigns of King <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and Queen <HI>James</HI>) We find the Whig-Scheme took place under the fir&s;t, and the Tory-Scheme under the latter. The fir&s;t, in whom the Whigs have always gloried, oppo&s;ed and humbled the mo&s;t powerful among the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Princes; rai&s;ed and &s;upported the <HI>Dutch</HI>; a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants; and made the Reformed Religion an Over-balance for Popery through all <HI>Europe.</HI> On the contrary, her Succe&s;&s;or aggrandized the Catholick King; alienated him&s;elf from the <HI>Dutch</HI>; &s;uffered the <HI>French</HI> Power to increa&s;e, till it was too late to remedy it; and abandoned the Intere&s;ts of the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Grand-father
<PB N="304" REF="323">
to His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, which might have &s;pread the Reformed Religion through all <HI>Germany.</HI> I need not de&s;cribe to the Reader the different &s;tate of the Kingdom&punc; as to its Reputation, Trade, and Wealth, under the&s;e two Reigns. We might, after this, compare the Figure in which the&s;e Kingdoms, and the whole Prote&s;tant Inte|re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> were placed by the Conduct of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and that of King <HI>Wiliam</HI>; and every one knows which of the Schemes prevailed in each of tho&s;e Reigns. I &s;hall not impute to any Tory Scheme the Admi|ni&s;tration of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, on Condi|tion that they do not reproach the Whigs with the U&s;urpation of <HI>Oliver</HI>; as being &s;atisfied that the Principles of tho&s;e Governments are re&s;pe|ctively di&s;claimed and abhorred by all the Men of Sen&s;e and Virtue in both Parties, as they now &s;tand. But we have a fre&s;h In&s;tance which will be remembred with Grief by the pre&s;ent Age and all our Po&s;terity, of the Influence both of Whig and Tory Principles in the late Reign. Was <HI>England</HI> ever &s;o glorious in the Eyes of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> as in that Part of it when the fir&s;t prevail|ed? Or was it ever more contemptible than when the la&s;t took Place.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add, under this Head, the Preference of the Whig-Scheme, with regard to Foreign|ners. All the Prote&s;tant States of <HI>Europe,</HI> who may be con&s;idered as Neutral Judges between both Parties, and are Well wi&s;hers to us in gene|ral, as to a Prote&s;tant People, rejoice upon the Succe&s;s of a Whig-Scheme; whil&s;t all of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> who contemn, hate and dete&s;t us as the great Bulwark of Here&s;y, are as much plea&s;ed when the oppo&s;ite Party triumphs in its Turn. And here let any impartial Man put this
<PB N="305" REF="324">
Que&s;tion to his own Heart, whether that Party doth not act rea&s;onably, who look upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> as their genuine Friends and Allies, con&s;i|dering that they are of the Reformed Religion, that they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in the greate&s;t Times of Nece&s;&s;ity, and that they can never entertain a Thought of reducing us under their Power. Or, on the other hand, let him con&s;ider whether that Party acts with more Rea&s;on, who are the avow|ed Friends of a Nation, that are of the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|tholick Religion, that have cruelly per&s;ecuted our Brethren of the Reformation, that have made Attempts in all Ages to conquer this I&s;land, and &s;upported the Intere&s;t of that Prince, who abdi|cated the Throne, and had endeavoured to &s;ub|vert our Civil and Religious Liberties.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Let us compare the&s;e two Schemes from the Effects they produce among our &s;elves within our own I&s;land; and the&s;e we may con|&s;ider, fir&s;t with regard to the King, and &s;econd|ly with regard to the People.</P>
<P>1&s;t. With regard to the King. The Whigs have always profe&s;&s;ed and practi&s;ed an Obedience which they conceive agreeable to the Con&s;titu|tion; whereas the Tories have concurred with the Whigs in their Practice, though they differ from them in their Profe&s;&s;ions; and have avow|ed a Principle of Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience to the Temp|tation, and afterwards to the De&s;truction, of tho&s;e who have relied upon it. Nor mu&s;t I here omit to take Notice of that firm and zealous Ad|herence which the Whig-Party have &s;hewn to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and to the Cau&s;e of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. I have never heard of any in this Principle, who was either guilty or &s;u&s;pect|ed of Mea&s;ures to defeat this E&s;tabli&s;hment, or to overturn it, &s;ince it has taken effect. A Con|&s;ideration,
<PB N="306" REF="325">
which it is hoped, may put to &s;ilence tho&s;e who upbraid the Whig-Schemes of Go|vernment, with an Inclination to a Common-wealth, or a Di&s;&s;affection to Kings.</P>
<P>2^d^l^y With regard to the People. Every one mu&s;t own, that tho&s;e Laws which have mo&s;t conduced to the Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s of the Sub|ject, have always pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Parliaments, which their Enemies branded with the Name of Whig, and during the Time of a Whig-Mini|&s;try. And, what is very remarkable, the Tories are now forced to have Recour&s;e to tho&s;e Laws for Shelter and Protection: by which they tacit|ly do Honour to the Whig-Scheme, and own it more accommodated to the Happine&s;s of the People, than that which they e&s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>I hope I need not quality the&s;e Remarks with a Suppo&s;ition which I have gone upon through the whole Cour&s;e of my Papers, that I am far from con&s;idering a great Part of tho&s;e who call them&s;eves Tories, as Enemies to the pre&s;ent E|&s;tabli&s;hment; and that by the Whigs I always mean tho&s;e who are Friends to our Con&s;titution, both in Church and State. As we may look up|on the&s;e to be, in the main, true Lovers of their Religion and Countrey, they &s;eem rather to be divided by accidental Friend&s;hips and Circum|&s;tances, than by any e&s;&s;ential Di&s;tinction.</P>

I would not be acce&s;&s;ary to the continuing of our Political Ferment, when Occa&s;ions of Di&s;|pute are not admini&s;ter'd to us by Matters de|pending before the Legi&s;lature; and when De|bates without Doors naturally fall with tho&s;e in the two Hou&s;es of Parliament. At the &s;ame time a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Freeholder would very ill di&s;charge his Part, if he did not acknowledge, with beco|ming Duty and Gratitude, the Excellency and Sea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e Laws, by which the Re|pre&s;entatives of Men in his Rank have recover'd their Countrey in a great mea&s;ure out of its Confu&s;ions, and provided for its future Peace and Happine&s;s under the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment. Their unanimous and regular Proceeding, under the Conduct of that honourable Per&s;on who fills their chair with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate abilities, and hath ju&s;tly gained the E&s;teem of all &s;ides by the Im|partiality of his Behaviour; the ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;ome Acts which they have pa&s;&s;ed, and their Di&s;-inclination to extend them any longer, than that Nece&s;&s;ity required; Their manife&s;t Aver|&s;ion to enter upon Schemes, which the Enemies of our Peace had in&s;inuated to have been their De&s;ign; together with that Temper &s;o &s;uitable to the Dignity of &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly, at a Juncture when it might have been expected that very un|u&s;ual Heats would have ari&s;en in a Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;o zealous for their King and Coun|trey; will be &s;ufficient to quiet tho&s;e ground|le&s;s Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions, which have been indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by the Ill wi&s;hers to our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Undertaking, which I am now laying down, was entered upon in the very Cri&s;is of the late Rebellion, when it was the Duty of e|very
<PB N="308" REF="327">
<HI>Briton</HI> to contribute his utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Government, in a manner &s;uitable to his Station and Abilities. All Services, which had a Tendency to this End, had a Degree of Merit in them, in proportion as the Event of that Cau&s;e which they e&s;pou&s;ed was then doubtful. But at pre&s;ent they might be regarded, not as Duties of private Men to their endanger'd Countrey, but as In&s;ults of the &s;ucce&s;sful over their defeat|ed Enemies.</P>
<P>Our Nation indeed continues to be agitated with Confu&s;ions and Tumults; but, God be thanked, the&s;e are only the impotent Remains of an unnatural Rebellion, and are no more than the After-to&s;&s;ings of a Sea when the Storm is laid. The Enemies of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, in&s;tead of &s;eeing him driven from his Throne, as they vain|ly hoped, find him in a Condition to vi&s;it his Dominions in <HI>Germany,</HI> without any Danger to him&s;elf or to the Publick; whil&s;t his dutiful Sub|jects would be in no ordinary Concern upon this occa&s;ion, had they not the Con&s;olation to find them&s;elves left under the Protection of a Prince who makes it his Ambition to copy out his Royal Father's Example; and who, by his Duty to His Maje&s;ty, and Affection to His People, is &s;o well qualified to be the Guardian of the Realm.</P>
<P>It would not be difficult to continue a Paper of this kind, if one were di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;ume the &s;ame Subjects, and weary out the Reader with the &s;ame Thoughts in a different Phra&s;e, or to ramble through the Cau&s;e of Whig and Tory, without any certain Aim or Method, in every particular Di&s;cour&s;e. Such a Practice in Politi|cal Writers, is like that of &s;ome Preachers taken Notice of by Dr. <HI>South,</HI> who being prepared only upon two or three Points of Doctrrine, run the
<PB N="309" REF="328">
&s;ame Round with their Audience, from one end of the Year to the other, and are always forced to tell them, by way of Preface, The&s;e are Parti|culars of &s;o great Importance, that they cannot be &s;ufficiently <HI>inculcated.</HI> To avoid this Method of Tautology, I have endeavoured to make every Paper a di&s;tinct E&s;&s;ay upon &s;ome particular Sub|ject, without deviating into Points foreign to the Tenor of each Di&s;cour&s;e. They are indeed mo&s;t of them E&s;&s;ays upon Government, but with a View to the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs in <HI>Great Britain</HI>; &s;o that if they have the good Fortune to live longer than Works of this Nature gene|rally do, future Readers may &s;ee in them, the Complexion of the Times in which they were written. However, as there is no Employment &s;o irk&s;ome, as that of tran&s;cribing out of one's &s;elf, next to that of tran&s;cribing out of others, I &s;hall let drop the Work, &s;ince there do not occur to me any material Points ari&s;ing from our pre&s;ent Situation, which I have not already touched upon.</P>
<P>As to the Rea&s;onings in the&s;e &s;everal Papers, I mu&s;t leave them to the Judgment of others. I have taken particular Care that they &s;hould be conformable to our Con&s;titution, and free from that Mixture of Violence and Pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;o often creeps into the Works of Political Writers. A good Cau&s;e doth not want any Bitterne&s;s to &s;upport it, as a bad one cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. It is indeed ob&s;ervable, that an Author is &s;currilous in proportion as he is dull; and &s;eems rather to be in a Pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he cannot find out what to &s;ay for his own Opinion, than be|cau&s;e he has di&s;covered any pernicious Ab&s;urdi|ties in that of his Antagoni&s;ts. A Man &s;atiri|zed by Writers of this Cla&s;s, is like one burnt
<PB N="310" REF="329">
in the Hand with a cold Iron: There may be ignominious Terms and Words of Infamy in the Stamp, but they leave no Impre&s;&s;ion behind them.</P>
<P>It would indeed have been an unpardonable In|&s;olence for a Fellow-Subject to treat in a vindi|ctive and cruel Style, tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom His Maje&s;ty has endeavoured to reduce to Obedience by <HI>Gentle Methods,</HI> which he has declared from the Throne to be <HI>mo&s;t agreeable to his Inclinations.</HI> May we not hope that all of this kind, who have the lea&s;t Sentiments of Honour or Grati|tude, will be won over to their Duty by &s;o ma|ny In&s;tances of Royal Clemency, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many repeated Provocations! May we not expect that <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Words to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> in which he &s;peaks of tho&s;e who were <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Enemies, and of his Conduct towards them, may be applied to His Maje&s;ty; <HI>Omnes enim qui fuerunt, aut &s;u&aacute; per|tinaci&acirc; vitam ami&s;erunt, aut tu&aacute; Mi&s;ericordid reti|nuerunt; ut aut nulli &s;uper&s;int de inimicis, aut qui &s;uperfuerunt, amici&s;&s;imi &s;int.&mdash;Quare gaude tuo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> tam excellenti bono, et fruere cum fortun&aacute;, et glori&aacute;, tum etiam natur&aacute;, et moribus tuis. Ex quo quidem maximus e&s;t fructus, jucundita&s;que &s;a|pienti&mdash;Nihil habet nec fortuna tua majus, quam ut po&s;&s;is, nec natura tua melius, quam ut velis, quamplurimos con&s;ervare.</HI></P>
<P>As for tho&s;e Papers of a gayer Turn, which may be met with in this Collection, my Reader will of him&s;elf, con&s;ider, how requi&s;ite they are to gain and keep up an Audience to Matters of this Nature; and will perhaps be the more In|dulgent to them, if he ob&s;erves, that they are none of them without a Moral, nor contain any thing but what is con&s;i&s;tent with Decency and Good Manners.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="330">
It is obvious that the De&s;ign of the whole Work, has been to free the Peoples Minds from tho&s;e Prejudices conveyed into them by the Ene|mies to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment again&s;t the King and Royal Family, by opening and explaining their real Characters; to &s;et forth His Maje&s;ty's Proceedings, which have been very gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;|repre&s;ented, in a fair and impartial Light; to &s;hew the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of our oppo&s;ing the Pretender to his Dominions, if we have any Regard to our Religion and Liberties: And, in a word, to incline the Minds of the People to the De&s;ire and Enjoyment of their own Happine&s;s. There is no Que&s;tion, humanly &s;peaking, but the&s;e great Ends will be brought a|bout in&s;en&s;ibly, as Men will grow weary of a fruitle&s;s Oppo&s;ition; and be convinced by Experi|ence, of a Nece&s;&s;ity to acquie&s;ce under a Govern|ment which daily gathers Strength, and is able to di&s;appoint the utmo&s;t Efforts of its Enemies. In the mean while, I would recommend to our Malecontents, the Advice given by a great Mo|rali&s;t to his Friend upon another Occa&s;ion; that he would &s;hew it was in the Power of Wi&s;dom to compo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ions; and let that be the Work of Rea&s;on which would certainly be the Effect of Time.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that if any Writer &s;hall do this Paper &s;o much Honour, as to in&s;cribe the Title of it to others, which may be publi&s;hed upon the laying down of this Work; the whole Prai&s;e, or Di&s;prai&s;e of &s;uch a Performance, will belong to &s;ome other Author; this 55^t^h being the la&s;t Paper that will come from the Hand of the <HI>Free-holder.</HI></P>
