<HEAD>Of the que&s;tion relating to the State of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>_NATURAL productions are generally formed by degrees. Vegetables grow from a tender &s;hoot, and animals from an infant &s;tate. The latter being de|&s;tined to act, extend their operations as their powers increa&s;e: they exhibit a progre&s;s in what they perform, as well as in the faculties
<PB N="2" REF="9">
they acquire, This progre&s;s in the ca&s;e of man is continued to a greater extent than in that of any other animal. Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the &s;pecies it&s;elf from rudene&s;s to civilization. Hence the &s;uppo&s;ed departure of mankind from the &s;tate of their na|ture; hence our conjectures and different opinions of what man mu&s;t have been in the fir&s;t age of his being. The poet, the hi&s;torian, and the mo|rali&s;t, frequently allude to this ancient time; and under the emblems of gold, or of iron, repre&s;ent a condition, and a manner of life, from which mankind have either degenerated, or on which they have greatly improved. On either &s;uppo&s;ition, the fir&s;t &s;tate of our nature mu&s;t have borne no re&s;emblance to what men have exhibited in any &s;ub&s;equent period; hi&s;torical monuments, even of the earlie&s;t date, are to be con&s;idered as novelties; and the mo&s;t common e&s;tabli&s;hments of human &s;ociety are to be cla&s;&s;ed among the incroachments which fraud, oppre&s;&s;ion, or a bu&s;y invention, have made upon the reign of nature, by which the chief of our grievances or ble&s;&s;ings were equally with|held.</P>
<P>AMONG the writers who have attempted to di&s;tingui&s;h, in the human character, its original qualities, and to point out the limits between nature and art, &s;ome have repre&s;ented mankind in their fir&s;t condition, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mere animal &s;en&s;ibility, without any exerci&s;e of the faculties that render them &s;uperior to the brutes, without any political union, without any means of explain|ing their &s;entiments, and even without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any of the apprehen&s;ions and pa&s;&s;ions which the voice and the ge&s;ture are &s;o well fitted to expre&s;s.
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Others have made the &s;tate of nature to con&s;i&s;t in perpetual wars, kindled by competition for domi|nion and intere&s;t, where every individual had a &s;eparate quarrel with his kind, and where the pre&s;ence of a fellow-creature was the &s;ignal of battle.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire of laying the foundation of a fa|vourite &s;y&s;tem, or a fond expectation, perhaps, that we may be able to penetrate the &s;ecrets of nature, to the very &s;ource of exi&s;tence, have, on this &s;ubject, led to many fruitle&s;s inquiries, and given ri&s;e to many wild &s;uppo&s;itions. Among the various qualities which mankind po&s;&s;e&s;s, we &s;elect one or a few particulars on which to e&s;tabli&s;h a theory, and in framing our account of what man was in &s;ome imaginary &s;tate of nature, we over|look what he has always appeared within the reach of our own ob&s;ervation, and in the records of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IN every other in&s;tance, however, the natural hi&s;torian thinks him&s;elf obliged to collect facts, not to offer conjectures. When he treats of any particular &s;pecies of animals, he &s;uppo&s;es, that their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;itions and in&s;tincts are the &s;ame they originally had, and that their pre&s;ent manner of life is a continuance of their fir&s;t de&s;tination. He admits, that his knowledge of the material &s;y&s;tem of the world con&s;i&s;ts in a collection of facts, or at mo&s;t, in general tenets derived from particular ob&s;ervations and experiments. It is only in what relates to him&s;elf, and in matters the mo&s;t important, and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily known, that he &s;ub&s;titutes hypothe&s;is in&s;tead of reality, and con|founds
<PB N="4" REF="11">
the provinces of imagination and rea&s;on, of poetry and &s;cience.</P>
<P>BUT without entering any farther on que&s;tions either in moral or phy&s;ical &s;ubjects, relating to the manner or the origin of our knowledge; without any di&s;paragement to that &s;ubtilty which would analyze every &s;entiment, and trace every mode of being to its &s;ource; it may be &s;afely affirmed, That the character of man, as he now exi&s;ts, that the laws of this animal and intellectual &s;y&s;tem, on which his happine&s;s now depends, de|&s;erve our principal &s;tudy; and that general prin|ciples relating to this, or any other &s;ubject, are u&s;eful only &s;o far as they are founded on ju&s;t ob|&s;ervation, and lead to the knowledge of important con&s;equences, or &s;o far as they enable us to act with &s;ucce&s;s when we would apply either the intel|lectual or the phy&s;ical powers of nature, to the great purpo&s;es of human life.</P>
<P>IF both the earlie&s;t and the late&s;t accounts col|lected from every quarter of the earth, repre&s;ent mankind as a&s;&s;embled in troops and companies; and the individual always joined by affection to one party, while he is po&s;&s;ibly oppo&s;ed to another; employed in the exerci&s;e of recollection and fore|&s;ight; inclined to communicate his own &s;enti|ments, and to be made acquainted with tho&s;e of others; the&s;e facts mu&s;t be admitted as the foun|dation of all our rea&s;oning relative to man. His mixed di&s;po&s;ition to friend&s;hip or enmity, his rea|&s;on, his u&s;e of language and articulate &s;ounds, like the &s;hape and the erect po&s;ition of his body, are to be con&s;idered as &s;o many attributes of his
<PB N="5" REF="12">
nature: they are to be retained in his de&s;cription, as the wing and the paw are in that of the eagle and the lion, and as different degrees of fiercene&s;s, vigilance, timidity, or &s;peed, are made to occupy a place in the natural hi&s;tory of different animals.</P>
<P>IF the que&s;tion be put, What the mind of man could perform, when left to it&s;elf, and without the aid of any foreign direction? we are to look for our an&s;wer in the hi&s;tory of mankind. Parti|cular experiments which have been found &s;o u&s;eful in e&s;tabli&s;hing the principles of other &s;ciences, could probably, on this &s;ubject, teach us nothing important, or new: we are to take the hi&s;tory of every active being from his conduct in the &s;itua|tion to which he is formed, not from his appear|ance in any forced or uncommon condition; a wild man therefore, caught in the woods, where he had always lived apart from his &s;pecies, is a &s;ingular in&s;tance, not a &s;pecimen of any general character. As the anatomy of an eye which had never received the impre&s;&s;ions of light, or that of an ear which had never felt the impul&s;e of &s;ounds, would probably exhibit defects in the very &s;truc|ture of the organs them&s;elves, ari&s;ing from their not being applied to their proper functions; &s;o any particular ca&s;e of this &s;ort would only &s;hew in what degree the powers of apprehen&s;ion and &s;en|timent could exi&s;t where they had not been em|ployed, and what would be the defects and imbe|cilities of a heart in which the emotions that per|tain to &s;ociety had never been felt.</P>
<P>MANKIND are to be taken in groupes, as they have always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. The hi&s;tory of the indivi|dual is but a detail of the &s;entiments and thoughts
<PB N="6" REF="13">
he has entertained in the view of his &s;pecies; and every experiment relative to this &s;ubject &s;hould be made with intire &s;ocieties, not with &s;ingle men. We have every rea&s;on, however, to believe, that in the ca&s;e of &s;uch an experiment made, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, with a colony of children tran&s;planted from the nur&s;ery, and left to form a &s;ociety apart, untaught, and undi&s;ciplined, we &s;hould only have the &s;ame things repeated, which, in &s;o many dif|ferent parts of the earth, have been tran&s;acted al|ready. The members of our little &s;ociety would feed and &s;leep, would herd together and play, would have a language of their own, would quar|rel and divide, would be to one another the mo&s;t important objects of the &s;cene, and, in the ardour of their friend&s;hips and competitions, would over|look their per&s;onal danger, and &s;u&s;pend the care of their &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Has not the human race been planted like the colony in que&s;tion? Who has directed their cour&s;e? who&s;e in&s;truction have they heard? or who&s;e example have they followed?</P>
<P>NATURE, therefore, we &s;hall pre&s;ume, having given to every animal its mode of exi&s;tence, its di&s;po&s;itions and manner of life, has dealt equally with tho&s;e of the human race; and the natural hi&s;torian who would collect the properties of this &s;pecies, may fill up every article now, as well as he could have done in any former age. Yet one property by which man is di&s;tingui&s;hed, has been &s;ometimes overlooked in the account of his nature, or has only &s;erved to mi&s;lead our attention. In other cla&s;&s;es of animals, the individual advances from infancy to age or maturity; and he attains, in the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle life, to all the perfection
<PB N="7" REF="14">
his nature can reach: but, in the human kind, the &s;pecies has a progre&s;s as well as the indivi|dual; they build in every &s;ub&s;equent age on foun|dations formerly laid; and, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, tend to a perfection in the application of their faculties, to which the aid of long experience is required, and to which many generations mu&s;t have combined their endeavours. We ob&s;erve the progre&s;s they have made; we di&s;tinctly enumerate many of its &s;teps; we can trace them back to a di&s;tant antiquity; of which no record remains, nor any monument is pre&s;erved, to inform us what were the openings of this wonderful &s;cene. The con&s;equence is, that in&s;tead of attending to the character of our &s;pecies, where the particu|lars are vouched by the &s;ure&s;t authority, we en|deavour to trace it through ages and &s;cenes un|known; and, in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing that the be|ginning of our &s;tory was nearly of a piece with the &s;equel, we think our&s;elves warranted to reject every circum&s;tance of our pre&s;ent condition and frame, as adventitious, and foreign to our nature. The progre&s;s of mankind from a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tate of animal &s;en&s;ibility, to the attainment of rea&s;on, to the u&s;e of language, and to the habit of &s;o|ciety, has been accordingly painted with a force of imagination, and its &s;teps have been marked with a boldne&s;s of invention, that would tempt us to admit, among the materials of hi&s;tory, the &s;ugge&s;tions of fancy, and to receive, perhaps, as the model of our nature in its original &s;tate, &s;ome of the animals who&s;e &s;hape has the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to ours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROUSSEAU &s;ur l'origine de l'inegalit&eacute; parmi les hommes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="15">
IT would be ridiculous to affirm, as a di&s;co|very, that the &s;pecies of the hor&s;e was probably never the &s;ame with that of the lion; yet, in op|po&s;ition to what has dropped from the pens of eminent writers, we are obliged to ob&s;erve, that men have always appeared among animals a di|&s;tinct and a &s;uperior race; that neither the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;imilar organs, nor the approximation of &s;hape, nor the u&s;e of the hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trait&eacute; de l'e&s;prit.</NOTE>, nor the con|tinued intercour&s;e with this &s;overeign arti&s;t, has enabled any other &s;pecies to blend their nature or their inventions with his; that in his rude&s;t &s;tate, he is found to be above them; and in his greate&s;t degeneracy, never de&s;cends to their level. He is, in &s;hort, a man in every condition; and we can learn nothing of his nature from the analogy of other animals. If we would know him, we mu&s;t attend to him&s;elf, to the cour&s;e of his life, and the tenor of his conduct. With him the &s;ociety appears to be as old as the individual, and the u&s;e of the tongue as univer&s;al as that of the hand or the foot. If there was a time in which he had his acquaintance with his own &s;pecies to make, and his faculties to acquire, it is a time of which we have no record, and in relation to which our opinions can &s;erve no purpo&s;e, and are &s;up|ported by no evidence.</P>
<P>WE are often tempted into tho&s;e boundle&s;s re|gions of ignorance or conjecture, by a fancy which delights in creating rather than in merely retain|ing the forms which are pre&s;ented before it: we are the dupes of a &s;ubtilty, which promi&s;es to &s;up|ply
<PB N="9" REF="16">
every defect of our knowledge, and, by fill|ing up a few blanks in the &s;tory of nature, pre|tends to conduct our apprehen&s;ion nearer to the &s;ource of exi&s;tence. On the credit of a few ob&s;er|vations, we are apt to pre&s;ume, that the &s;ecret may &s;oon be laid open, and that what is termed <HI>wi&s;|dom</HI> in nature, may be referred to the operation of phy&s;ical powers. We forget that phy&s;ical powers, employed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and combined to a &s;aluta|ry purpo&s;e, con&s;titute tho&s;e very proofs of de&s;ign from which we infer the exi&s;tence of God; and that this truth being once admitted, we are no long|er to &s;earch for the &s;ource of exi&s;tence; we can only collect the laws which the author of nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed; and in our late&s;t as well as our earlie&s;t di&s;coveries, only come to perceive a mode of creation or providence before unknown.</P>
<P>WE &s;peak of art as di&s;tingui&s;hed from nature; but art it&s;elf is natural to man. He is in &s;ome mea|&s;ure the artificer of his own frame, as well as his fortune, and is de&s;tined, from the fir&s;t age of his being, to invent and contrive. He applies the &s;ame talents to a variety of purpo&s;es, and acts nearly the &s;ame part in very different &s;cenes. He would be always improving on his &s;ubject, and he carries this intention where-ever he moves, through the &s;treets of the populous city, or the wilds of the fore&s;t. While he appears equally fitted to every condition, he is upon this account unable to &s;ettle in any. At once ob&s;tinate and fickle, he complains of innova|tions, and is never &s;ated with novelty. He is per|petually bu&s;ied in reformations, and is continually wedded to his errors. If he dwell in a cave, he would improve it into a cottage; if he has already built, he would &s;till build to a greater extent.
<PB N="10" REF="17">
But he does not propo&s;e to make rapid and ha&s;ty tran&s;itions; his &s;teps are progre&s;&s;ive and &s;low; and his force, like the power of a &s;pring, &s;ilently pre&s;|&s;es on every re&s;i&s;tance; an effect is &s;ometimes pro|duced before the cau&s;e is perceived; and with all his talent for projects, his work is often ac|compli&s;hed before the plan is devi&s;ed. It ap|pears, perhaps, equally difficult to retard or to quicken his pace; if the projector complain he is tardy, the morali&s;t thinks him un&s;table; and whe|ther his motions be rapid or &s;low, the &s;cenes of human affairs perpetually change in his manage|ment: his emblem is a pa&s;&s;ing &s;tream, not a &s;tag|nating pool. We may de&s;ire to direct his love of improvement to its proper object, we may wi&s;h for &s;tability of conduct; but we mi&s;take human nature, if we wi&s;h for a termination of labour, or a &s;cene of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE occupations of men, in every condition, be&s;peak their freedom of choice, their various opi|nions, and the multiplicity of wants by which they are urged: but they enjoy, or endure, with a &s;en|&s;ibility, or a phlegm, which are nearly the &s;ame in every &s;ituation. They po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian, or the Atlantic, by a different tenure, but with equal ea&s;e. On the one they are fixed to the &s;oil, and &s;eem to be formed for &s;ettlement, and the accommodation of cities: The names they be&s;tow on a nation, and on its territory, are the &s;ame. On the other they are mere animals of pa&s;&s;age, prepared to roam on the face of the earth, and with their herds, in &s;earch of new pa&s;|ture and favourable &s;ea&s;ons, to follow the &s;un in his annual cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">
MAN finds his lodgement alike in the cave, the cottage, and the palace; and his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence equal|ly in the woods, in the dairy, or the farm. He a&s;&s;umes the di&s;tinction of titles, equipage, and dre&s;s; he devi&s;es regular &s;y&s;tems of government, and a complicated body of laws: or, naked in the woods, has no badge of &s;uperiority but the &s;trength of his limbs and the &s;agacity of his mind; no rule of conduct but choice; no tie with his fellow|creatures but affection, the love of company, and the de&s;ire of &s;afety. Capable of a great variety of arts, yet dependent on none in particular for the pre&s;ervation of his being; to whatever length he has carried his artifice, there he &s;eems to enjoy the conveniencies that &s;uit his nature, and to have found the condition to which he is de&s;tined. The tree which an American, on the banks of the O|roonoko<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lafitau moeurs des &s;auvages.</NOTE>, has cho&s;en to climb for the retreat, and the lodgement of his family, is to him a conve|nient dwelling. The &s;opha, the vaulted dome, and the colonade, do not more effectually content their native inhabitant.</P>
<P>IF we are a&s;ked therefore, Where the &s;tate of nature is to be found? we may an&s;wer, It is here; and it matters not whether we are under&s;tood to &s;peak in the i&s;land of Great Britain, at the Cape of Good Hope, or the Straits of Magellan. While this active being is in the train of employing his talents, and of operating on the &s;ubjects around him, all &s;ituations are equally natural. If we are told, That vice, at lea&s;t, is contrary to nature; we
<PB N="12" REF="19">
may an&s;wer, It is wor&s;e; it is folly and wretched|ne&s;s. But if nature is only oppo&s;ed to art, in what &s;ituation of the human race are the foot&s;teps of art unknown? In the condition of the &s;avage, as well as in that of the citizen, are many proofs of human invention; and in either is not any perma|nent &s;tation, but a mere &s;tage through which this travelling being is de&s;tined to pa&s;s. If the palace be unnatural, the cottage is &s;o no le&s;s; and the highe&s;t refinements of political and moral appre|hen&s;ion, are not more artificial in their kind, than the fir&s;t operations of &s;entiment and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>IF we admit that man is &s;u&s;ceptible of improve|ment, and has in him&s;elf a principle of progre&s;&s;ion, and a de&s;ire of perfection, it appears improper to &s;ay, that he has quitted the &s;tate of his nature, when he has begun to proceed; or that he finds a &s;tation for which he was not intended, while, like other animals, he only follows the di&s;po&s;ition, and employs the powers that nature has given.</P>
<P>THE late&s;t efforts of human invention are but a continuation of certain devices which were prac|ti&s;ed in the earlie&s;t ages of the world, and in the rude&s;t &s;tate of mankind. What the &s;avage pro|jects, or ob&s;erves, in the fore&s;t, are the &s;teps which led nations, more advanced, from the architecture of the cottage to that of the palace, and conduct|ed the human mind from the perceptions of &s;en&s;e, to the general conclu&s;ions of &s;cience.</P>
<P>ACKNOWLEDGED defects are to man in every condition matter of di&s;like. Ignorance and imbe|cility are objects of contempt: penetration and conduct give eminence, and procure e&s;teem. Whi|ther
<PB N="13" REF="20">
&s;hould his feelings and apprehen&s;ions on the&s;e &s;ubjects lead him? To a progre&s;s, no doubt, in which the &s;avage, as well as the philo&s;opher, is engaged; in which they have made different ad|vances, but in which their ends are the &s;ame. The admiration Cicero entertained for literature, elo|quence, and civil accompli&s;hments, was not more real than that of a Scythian for &s;uch a mea&s;ure of &s;imilar endowments as his own apprehen&s;ion could reach. <Q>Were I to boa&s;t,</Q> &s;ays a Tartar prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abulgaze Bahadur Chan.; Hi&s;tory of the Tartars.</NOTE>,

<P>MAN may mi&s;take the objects of his pur&s;uit; he may mi&s;apply his indu&s;try, and mi&s;place his improvements. If under a &s;en&s;e of &s;uch po&s;&s;ible errors, he would find a &s;tandard by which to judge of his own proceedings, and arrive at the be&s;t &s;tate of his nature, he cannot find it perhaps in the practice of any individual, or of any nation whatever; not even in the &s;en&s;e of the majority, or the prevailing opinion of his kind. He mu&s;t look for it in the be&s;t conceptions of his under|&s;tanding, in the be&s;t movements of his heart; he mu&s;t thence di&s;cover what is the perfection and the

happine&s;s of which he is capable. He will find, on the &s;crutiny, that the proper &s;tate of his na|ture, taken in this &s;en&s;e, is not a condition from which mankind are for ever removed, but one to which they may now attain; not prior to the ex|erci&s;e of their faculties, but procured by their ju&s;t application.</P>
<P>OF all the terms that we employ in treating of human affairs, tho&s;e of <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>unnatural</HI> are the lea&s;t determinate in their meaning. Op|po&s;ed to affectation, frowardne&s;s, or any other de|fect of the temper or character, the natural is an epithet of prai&s;e; but employed to &s;pecify a con|duct which proceeds from the nature of man, can &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h nothing: for all the actions of men are equally the re&s;ult of their nature. At mo&s;t, this language can only refer to the general and prevailing &s;en&s;e or practice of mankind; and the purpo&s;e of every important inquiry on this &s;ubject may be &s;erved by the u&s;e of a language equally familiar and more preci&s;e. What is ju&s;t, or unju&s;t? What is happy, or wretched, in the manners of men? What, in their various &s;ituati|ons, is favourable or adver&s;e to their amiable qua|lities? are que&s;tions to which we may expect a &s;a|tisfactory an&s;wer; and whatever may have been the original &s;tate of our &s;pecies, it is of more impor|tance to know the condition to which we our&s;elves &s;hould a&s;pire, than that which our ance&s;tors may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have left.</P>

<HEAD>Of the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation.</HEAD>
<P>IF in human nature there are qualities by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other part of the animal creation, men are them&s;elves in different climates and in different ages greatly diver&s;ified. So far as we are able to account for this diver&s;ity on principles either moral or phy&s;ical, we perform a ta&s;k of great curio&s;ity or &s;ignal utility. It ap|pears nece&s;&s;ary, however, that we attend to the univer&s;al qualities of our nature, before we regard its varieties, or attempt to explain differences con|&s;i&s;ting in the unequal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or application of di&s;po&s;itions and powers that are in &s;ome mea&s;ure common to all mankind.</P>
<P>MAN, like the other animals, has certain in|&s;tinctive propen&s;ities, which, prior to the percep|tion of plea&s;ure or pain, and prior to the experi|ence of what is pernicious or u&s;eful, lead him to perform many functions of nature relative to him|&s;elf and to his fellow-creatures. He has one &s;et of di&s;po&s;itions which refer to his animal pre&s;ervation, and to the continuance of his race; another which lead to &s;ociety, and by inli&s;ting him on the &s;ide of one tribe or community, frequently engage him in war and contention with the re&s;t of mankind. His powers of di&s;cernment, or his intellectual fa|culties, which, under the appellation of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the analogous endowments of other animals, refer to the objects around him, ei|ther as they are &s;ubjects of mere knowledge, or
<PB N="16" REF="23">
as they are &s;ubjects of approbation or cen&s;ure. He is formed not only to know, but likewi&s;e to ad|mire and to contemn; and the&s;e proceedings of his mind have a principal reference to his own cha|racter, and to that of his fellow-creatures, as be|ing the &s;ubjects on which he is chiefly concerned to di&s;tingui&s;h what is right from what is wrong. He enjoys his felicity likewi&s;e on certain fixed and determinate conditions; and either as an individu|al apart, or as a member of civil &s;ociety, mu&s;t take a particular cour&s;e in order to reap the advantages of his nature. He is, withal, in a very high de|gree &s;u&s;ceptible of habits; and can, by forbear|ance or exerci&s;e, &s;o far weaken, confirm, or even diver&s;ify his talents, and his di&s;po&s;itions, as to ap|pear, in a great mea&s;ure, the arbiter of his own rank in nature, and the author of all the varities which are exhibited in the actual hi&s;tory of his &s;pecies. The univer&s;al characteri&s;tics, in the mean time, to which we have now referred, mu&s;t, when we would treat of any part of this hi&s;tory, con&s;ti|tute the fir&s;t &s;ubject of our attention; and they require not only to be enumerated, but to be di&s;|tinctly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;itions which refer to the pre&s;ervati|on of the individual, while they continue to ope|rate in the manner of in&s;tinctive de&s;ires, are near|ly the &s;ame in man that they are in the other ani|mals: but in him they are &s;ooner or later combi|ned with reflection and fore&s;ight; they give ri&s;e to his apprehen&s;ions on the &s;ubject of property, and make him acquainted with that object of care which he calls his intere&s;t. Without the in&s;tincts which teach the beaver and the &s;qurrel, the ant and the bee, to make up their little hoards for winter, at
<PB N="17" REF="24">
fir&s;t improvident, and, where no immediate object of pa&s;&s;ion is near, addicted to &s;loth, he becomes, in proce&s;s of time, the great &s;torema&s;ter among animals. He finds in a provi&s;ion of wealth, which he is probably never to employ, an object of his greate&s;t &s;olicitude, and the principal idol of his mind. He apprehends a relation between his per&s;on and his property, which renders what he calls his own in a manner a part of him&s;elf, a con|&s;tituent of his rank, his condition, and his charac|ter, in which, independent of any real enjoyment, he may be fortunate or unhappy; and, independent of any per&s;onal merit, he may be an object of con&s;ideration or neglect; and in which he may be wounded and injured, while his per&s;on is &s;afe, and every want of his nature completely &s;upplied.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, while other pa&s;&s;ions on|ly operate occa&s;ionally, the intere&s;ted find the ob|ject of their ordinary cares; their motive to the practice of mechanic and commercial arts; their temptation to tre&s;pa&s;s on the laws of ju&s;tice; and, when extremely corrupted, the price of their pro|&s;titutions, and the &s;tandard of their opinions on the &s;ubject of good and evil. Under this influence, they would enter, if not re&s;trained by the laws of civil &s;ociety, on a &s;cene of violence or meanne&s;s, which would exhibit our &s;pecies, by turns, under an a&s;pect more terrible and odious, or more vile and contemptible than that of any animal which inherits the earth.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the con&s;ideration of intere&s;t is founded on the experience of animal wants and de|&s;ires, its object is not to gratify any particular ap|petite, but to &s;ecure the means of gratifying all; and it impo&s;es frequently a re&s;traint on the very de|&s;ires
<PB N="18" REF="25">
from which it aro&s;e, more powerful and more &s;evere than tho&s;e of religion or duty. It ari&s;es from the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation in the human frame; but is a corruption, or at lea&s;t a partial re|&s;ult, of tho&s;e principles, and is upon many ac|counts very improperly termed <HI>&s;elf-love.</HI></P>
<P>LOVE is an affection which carries the attention of the mind beyond it&s;elf, and has a quality which we call <HI>tenderne&s;s,</HI> that never can accompany the con&s;iderations of intere&s;t. This affection being a complacency and a continued &s;atisfaction in its ob|ject, independent of any external event, it has, in the mid&s;t of di&s;appointment and &s;orrow, plea&s;ures and triumphs unknown to tho&s;e who act without any regard to their fellow-creatures; and in every change of condition, it continues entirely di&s;tinct from the &s;entiments which we feel on the &s;ubject of per&s;onal &s;ucce&s;s or adver&s;ity. But as the care a man entertains for his own intere&s;t, and the attention his affection makes him pay to that of another, may have &s;imilar effects, the one on his own fortune, the other on that of his friend, we confound the princi|ples from which he acts; we &s;uppo&s;e that they are the &s;ame in kind, only referred to different objects; and we not only mi&s;apply the name of love, in con|junction with &s;elf, but, in a manner tending to de|grade our nature, we limit the aim of this &s;uppo|&s;ed &s;elfi&s;h affection to the &s;ecuring or accumulating the con&s;tituents of intere&s;t, or the means of mere animal life.</P>
<P>IT is &s;omewhat remarkable, that notwith&s;tand|ing men value them&s;elves &s;o much on qualities of the mind, on parts, learning and wit, on courage, genero&s;ity, and honour, tho&s;e men are &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the highe&s;t degree &s;elfi&s;h or attentive to
<PB N="19" REF="26">
them&s;elves, who are mo&s;t careful of animal life, and who are lea&s;t mindful of rendering that life an object worthy of care. It will be difficult, howe|ver, to tell why a good under&s;tanding, a re&s;olute and generous mind, &s;hould not, by every man in his &s;en&s;es, be reckoned as much parts of him&s;elf, as either his &s;tomach or his palate, and much more than his e&s;tate or his dre&s;s. The epicure, who con|&s;ults his phy&s;ician, how he may re&s;tore his reli&s;h for food, and by creating an appetite, may increa&s;e the means of enjoyment, might at lea&s;t with an equal regard to him&s;elf, con&s;ult how he might &s;trengthen his affection to a parent or a child, to his country or to mankind; and it is probable that an appetite of this &s;ort would prove a &s;ource of en|joyment not le&s;s than the former.</P>
<P>BY our &s;uppo&s;ed &s;elfi&s;h maxims, notwith&s;tand|ing, we generally exclude from among the objects of our per&s;onal cares, many of the happier and more re&s;pectable qualities of human nature. We con&s;ider affection and courage as mere follies, that lead us to neglect or expo&s;e our&s;elves; we make wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;t in a regard to our intere&s;t; and without explaining what intere&s;t means, we would have it under&s;tood as the only rea&s;onable motive of action with mankind. There is even a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy founded upon tenets of this &s;ort, and &s;uch is our opinion of what men are likely to do upon &s;elfi&s;h principles, that we think it mu&s;t have a tendency very dangerous to virtue. But the er|rors of this &s;y&s;tem do not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in ge|neral principles, as in their particular applications; not &s;o much in teaching men to regard them|&s;elves, as in leading them to forget that their happie&s;t affections, their candour, and their in|dependence
<PB N="20" REF="27">
of mind, are in reality parts of them|&s;elves. And the adver&s;aries of this &s;uppo&s;ed &s;elfi&s;h philo&s;ophy, where it makes &s;elf-love the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion with mankind, have had rea&s;on to find fault, not &s;o much with its general repre&s;entations of hu|man nature, as with the obtru&s;ion of a mere in|novation in language for a di&s;covery in &s;cience.</P>
<P>WHEN the vulgar &s;peak of their different mo|tives, they are &s;atisfied with ordinary names, which refer to known and obvious di&s;tinctions. Of this kind are the terms <HI>benevolence</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> by which they expre&s;s their de&s;ire of the welfare of others, or the care of their own. The &s;peculative are not always &s;atisfied with this proceeding; they would analyze, as well as enumerate the principles of nature; and the chance is, that, merely to gain the appearance of &s;omething new, without any pro&s;pect of real advantage, they will di&s;turb the order of vulgar apprehen&s;ion. In the ca&s;e before us, they have actually found, that benevolence is no more than a &s;pecies of &s;elf-love; and would oblige us, if po&s;&s;ible, to look out for a new &s;et of words, by which we may di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the parent when he takes care of his child, from his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s when he only takes care of him&s;elf. For according to this philo&s;ophy, as in both ca&s;es he only means to gratify a de&s;ire of his own, he is in both ca&s;es equally &s;elfi&s;h. The term <HI>benevolent,</HI> in the mean time, is not employed to characteri&s;e per&s;ons who have no de&s;ires of their own, but per|&s;ons who&s;e own de&s;ires prompt them to procure the welfare of others. The fact is, that we &s;hould need only a fre&s;h &s;upply of language, in&s;tead of that which by this &s;eeming di&s;covery we &s;hould have lo&s;t, in order to make the rea&s;onings of men proceed
<PB N="21" REF="28">
as they formerly did. But it is certainly impo&s;&s;ible to live and to act with men, without employing different names to di&s;tingui&s;h the hu|mane from the cruel, and the benevolent from the &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>THESE terms have their equivalents in every tongue; they were invented by men of no re|finement, who only meant to expre&s;s what they di&s;tinctly perceived or &s;trongly felt. And if a man of &s;peculation &s;hould prove that we are &s;el|fi&s;h in a &s;en&s;e of his own, it does not follow that we are &s;o in the &s;en&s;e of the vulgar; or, as ordi|nary men would under&s;tand his conclu&s;ion, that we are condemned in every in&s;tance to act on mo|tives of intere&s;t, covetou&s;ne&s;s, pu&s;illanimity, and cowardice; for &s;uch is conceived to be the ordi|nary import of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in the character of man.</P>
<P>AN affection or pa&s;&s;ion of any kind is &s;ome|times &s;aid to give us an intere&s;t in its object; and humanity it&s;elf gives an intere&s;t in the welfare of mankind. This term <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> which commonly implies little more than our regard to property, is &s;ometimes put for utility in general, and this for happine&s;s; in&s;omuch that, under the&s;e ambigui|ties, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing we are &s;till unable to de|termine, whether intere&s;t is the only motive of human action, and the &s;tandard by which to di|&s;tingui&s;h our good from our ill.</P>
<P>SO much is &s;aid in this place, not from any de&s;ire to have a &s;hare in any controver&s;y of this &s;ort, but merely to confine the meaning of the term <HI>in|tere&s;t</HI> to its mo&s;t common accep ation, and to in|timate our intention of employing it in expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="22" REF="29">
tho&s;e objects of care which refer to our external condition, and the pre&s;ervation of our animal na|ture. When taken in this &s;en&s;e, it will not &s;urely be thought to comprehend at once all the motives of human conduct. If men be not allowed to have di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, they will not be denied to have di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ions of another kind. Ha|tred, indignation, and rage, frequently urge them to act in oppo&s;ition to their known intere&s;t, and even to hazard their lives, without any hopes of compen&s;ation in any future returns of preferment or profit.</P>

<HEAD>Of the principles of Union among Mankind.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have always wandered or &s;ett|led, agreed or quarrelled, in troops and companies. The cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling, what|ever it be, is the principle of their alliance or union.</P>
<P>IN collecting the materials of hi&s;tory, we are &s;eldom willing to put up with our &s;ubject merely as we find it. We are loth to be embarra&s;&s;ed with a multiplicity of particulars, and apparent incon|&s;i&s;tencies. In theory we profe&s;s the inve&s;tigation of general principles; and in order to bring the matter of our inquiries within the reach of our comprehen&s;ion, are di&s;po&s;ed to adopt any &s;y&s;tem. Thus, in treating of human affairs, we would draw every con&s;equence from a principle of union, or a principle of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of war or of amity, and men are made to unite from a principle of affection, or from a principle of fear, as is mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;y&s;tem of different writers. The hi&s;tory of our &s;pecies indeed abundantly &s;hews, that they are to one an|other mutual objects both of fear and of love; and they who would prove them to have been originally either in a &s;tate of alliance, or of war, have arguments in &s;tore to maintain their a&s;&s;erti|ons. Our attachment to one divi&s;ion, or to one &s;ect, &s;eems often to derive much of its force from an animo&s;ity conceived to an oppo&s;ite one: and this animo&s;ity in its turn, as often ari&s;es from a
<PB N="24" REF="31">
zeal in behalf of the &s;ide we e&s;pou&s;e, and from a de&s;ire to vindicate the rights of our party.</P>
<P><Q>MAN is born in &s;ociety,</Q> &s;ays Monte&s;quieu, <Q>and there he remains.</Q> The charms that de|tain him are known to be manifold. We may reckon the parental affection, which, in&s;tead of de|&s;erting the adult, as among the brutes, embraces more clo&s;e, as it becomes mixed with e&s;teem, and the memory of its early effects; together with a propen&s;ity common to man and other animals, to mix with the herd, and, without reflection, to fol|low the croud of his &s;pecies. What this propen&s;ity was in the fir&s;t moment of its operation, we know not; but with men accu&s;tomed to company, its enjoyments and di&s;appointments are reckoned a|mong the principal plea&s;ures or pains of human life. Sadne&s;s and melancholy are connected with &s;oli|tude; gladne&s;s and plea&s;ure with the concour&s;e of men. The track of a Laplander on the &s;nowy &s;hore, gives joy to the lonely mariner; and the mute &s;igns of cordiality and kindne&s;s which are made to him, awaken the memory of plea&s;ures which he felt in &s;ociety. In fine, &s;ays the writer of a voyage to the north, after de&s;cribing a mute &s;cene of this &s;ort,
<Q>We were extremely plea&s;ed to con|ver&s;e with men, &s;ince in thirteen months we had &s;een no human creature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collection of Dutch voyages.</NOTE>.</Q>
But we need no remote ob&s;ervation to confirm this po&s;ition: The wailings of the infant, and the languors of the adult, when alone; the lively joys of the one, and the chearfulne&s;s of the other, upon the return of company, are a &s;ufficient proof of its &s;olid foun|dations in the frame of our nature.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">
IN accounting for actions we often forget that we our&s;elves have acted; and in&s;tead of the &s;en|timents which &s;timulate the mind in the pre&s;ence of its object, we a&s;&s;ign as the motives of conduct with men, tho&s;e con&s;iderations which occur in the hours of retirement and cold reflection. In this mood frequently we can find nothing important, be&s;ides the deliberate pro&s;pects of intere&s;t; and a great work, like that of forming &s;ociety, mu&s;t in our apprehen&s;ion ari&s;e from deep reflections, and be carried on with a view to the advantages which mankind derive from commerce and mutual &s;up|port. But neither a propen&s;ity to mix with the herd, nor the &s;en&s;e of advantages enjoyed in that condition, comprehend all the principles by which men are united together. Tho&s;e bands are even of a feeble texture, when compared to the re&s;olute ardour with which a man adheres to his friend, or to his tribe, after they have for &s;ome time run the career of fortune together. Mutual di&s;cove|ries of genero&s;ity, joint trials of fortitude, redou|ble the ardours of friend&s;hip, and kindle a flame in the human brea&s;t, which the con&s;iderations of per&s;onal intere&s;t or &s;afety cannot &s;uppre&s;s. The mo&s;t lively tran&s;ports of joy are &s;een, and the loude&s;t &s;hrieks of de&s;pair are heard, when the objects of a tender affection are beheld in a &s;tate of triumph or of &s;uffering. An Indian recovered his friend unexpectedly on the i&s;land of Juan Fer|nandes: He pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, at his feet: <Q>We &s;tood gazing in &s;ilence,</Q> &s;ays Dampier, <Q>at this tender &s;cene.</Q> If we would know what is the religion of a wild American, what it is in his heart that mo&s;t re&s;embles devo|tion: it is not his fear of the &s;orcerer, nor his

hope of protection from the &s;pirits of the air or the wood; it is the ardent affection with which he &s;elects and embraces his friend; with which he clings to his &s;ide in every &s;ea&s;on of peril; and with which he invokes his &s;pirit from a di&s;tance, when dangers &s;urpri&s;e him alone.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix; Hi&s;t. Canada.</NOTE> Whatever proofs we may have of the &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition of man in familiar and contiguous &s;cenes, it is po&s;|&s;ibly of importance, to draw our ob&s;ervations from the examples of men who live in the &s;im|ple&s;t condition, and who have not learned to affect what they do not actually feel.</P>
<P>MERE acquaintance and habitude nouri&s;h af|fection, and the experience of &s;ociety brings every pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind upon its &s;ide. Its tri|umphs and pro&s;perities, its calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, bring a variety and a force of emotion, which can only have place in the company of our fellow|creatures. It is here that a man is made to for|get his weakne&s;s, his cares of &s;afety, and his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and to act from tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which make him di&s;cover his force. It is here he finds that his arrows fly &s;wifter than an eagle, and his weapons wound deeper than the paw of the lion, or the tooth of the boar. It is not alone his &s;en&s;e of a &s;upport which is near, nor the love of di&s;tinc|tion in the opinion of his tribe, that in&s;pire his courage, or &s;well his heart with a confidence that exceeds what his natural force &s;hould be&s;tow. Vehement pa&s;&s;ions of animo&s;ity or attachment are the fir&s;t exertions of vigour in his brea&s;t; under their influence, every con&s;ideration, but that of
<PB N="27" REF="34">
his object, is forgotten; dangers and difficulties only excite him the more.</P>
<P>THAT condition is &s;urely favourable to the nature of any being, in which his force is in|crea&s;ed; and if courage be the gift of &s;ociety to man, we have rea&s;on to con&s;ider his union with his &s;pecies as the noble&s;t part of his fortune. From this &s;ource are derived, not only the force, but the very exi&s;tence of his happie&s;t emotions; not only the better part, but almo&s;t the whole of his rational character. Send him to the de&s;ert alone, he is a plant torn from its roots: the form indeed may remain, but every faculty droops and withers; the human per&s;onage and the human cha|racter cea&s;e to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>MEN are &s;o far from valuing &s;ociety on ac|count of its mere external conveniencies, that they are commonly mo&s;t attached where tho&s;e conveniences are lea&s;t frequent; and are there mo&s;t faithful, where the tribute of their allegiance is paid in blood. Affection operates with the greate&s;t force, where it meets with the greate&s;t difficulties: In the brea&s;t of the parent, it is mo&s;t &s;olicitous amid&s;t the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the child: In the brea&s;t of a man, its flame redoubles where the wrongs or &s;ufferings of his friend, or his country, require his aid. It is, in &s;hort, from this principle alone that we can account for the ob&s;tinate attachment of a &s;avage to his un&s;ettled and defencele&s;s tribe, when temptations on the &s;ide of ea&s;e and of &s;afety might induce him to fly from famine and danger, to a &s;tation more affluent, and more &s;ecure. Hence the &s;anguine affection which every Greek bore to his country, and
<PB N="28" REF="35">
hence the devoted patrioti&s;m of an early Roman. Let tho&s;e examples be compared with the &s;pirit which reigns in a commercial &s;tate, where men may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have experienced, in its full extent, the intere&s;t which individuals have in the pre&s;ervation of their country. It is here, indeed, if ever, that man is &s;ometimes found a detached and &s;olitary being: he has found an object which &s;ets him in competition with his fellow-creatures, and he deals with them as he does with his cattle and his &s;oil, for the &s;ake of the profits they bring. The mighty engine which we &s;uppo&s;e to have formed &s;ociety, only tends to &s;et its members at variance, or to continue their intercour&s;e after the bands of affection are broken.</P>

<HEAD>Of the principles of War and Di&s;&s;en&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THERE are &s;ome circum&s;tances in the lot of mankind,</Q> &s;ays Socrates, <Q>that &s;hew them to be de&s;tined to friend&s;hip and amity: Tho&s;e are, their mutual need of one another; their mutual compa&s;&s;ion; their &s;en&s;e of mutual benefits; and the plea&s;ures ari&s;ing in company. There are other circum&s;tances which prompt them to war and di&s;&s;en&s;ion; the admi|ration and the de&s;ire which they entertain for the &s;ame &s;ubjects; their oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions; and the provocations which they mutually offer in the cour&s;e of their competitions.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we endeavour to apply the maxims of natural ju&s;tice to the &s;olution of difficult que&s;tions, we find that &s;ome ca&s;es may be &s;uppo&s;ed, and actually happen, where oppo&s;itions take place, and are lawful, prior to any provocation, or act of inju&s;tice; that where the &s;afety and pre&s;erva|tion of numbers are mutually incon&s;i&s;tent, one party may employ his right of defence, before the other has begun an attack. And when we join with &s;uch examples, the in&s;tances of mi&s;take, and mi&s;under&s;tanding, to which mankind are expo&s;ed, we may be &s;atisfied that war does not always proceed from an intention to injure; and that even the be&s;t qualities of men, their can|dour, as well as their re&s;olution, may operate in the mid&s;t of their quarrels.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">
THERE is &s;till more to be ob&s;erved on this &s;ubject. Mankind not only find in their condition the &s;ources of variance and di&s;&s;en&s;ion; they ap|pear to have in their minds the &s;eeds of animo&s;ity, and to embrace the occa&s;ions of mutual oppo&s;ition, with alacrity and plea&s;ure In the mo&s;t pacific &s;ituation there are few who have not their enemies, as well as their friends; and who are not plea&s;ed with oppo&s;ing the proceedings of one, as much as with favouring the de&s;igns of another. Small and &s;imple tribes, who in their dome&s;tic &s;ociety have the firme&s;t union, are in their &s;tate of op|po&s;ition as &s;eparate nations, frequently animated with the mo&s;t implacable hatred. Among the ci|tizens of Rome, in the early ages of that republic, the name of a foreigner, and that of an enemy, were the &s;ame. Among the Greeks, the name of Barbarian, under which that people comprehended every nation that was of a race, and &s;poke a lan|guage, different from their own, became a term of indi&s;criminate contempt and aver&s;ion. Even where no particular claim to &s;uperiority is formed, the repugnance to union, the frequent wars, or rather the perpetual ho&s;tilities, which take place among rude nations and &s;eparate clans, di&s;cover how much our &s;pecies is di&s;po&s;ed to oppo&s;ition, as well as to concert.</P>
<P>LATE di&s;coveries have brought us to the know|ledge of almo&s;t every &s;ituation in which mankind are placed. We have found them &s;pread over large and exten&s;ive continents, where communica|tions are open, and where national confederacy might be ea&s;ily formed. We have found them in narrower di&s;tricts, circum&s;cribed by mountains,
<PB N="31" REF="38">
great rivers, and arms of the &s;ea. They have been found in &s;mall and remote i&s;lands, where the inhabitants might be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled, and derive an advantage from their union. But in all tho&s;e &s;ituations, alike, they were broke into cantons, and affected a di&s;tinction of name and community. The titles of <HI>fellow-citizen</HI> and <HI>countryman,</HI> un|oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e of <HI>alien</HI> and <HI>foreigner,</HI> to which they refer, would fall into di&s;u&s;e, and lo&s;e their meaning. We love individuals on account of per&s;onal qualities; but we love our country, as it is a party in the divi&s;ions of mankind; and our zeal for its intere&s;t, is a predilection in behalf of the &s;ide we maintain.</P>
<P>IN the promi&s;cuous concour&s;e of men, it is &s;ufficient that we have an opportunity of &s;electing our company. We turn away from tho&s;e who do not engage us, and we fix our re&s;ort where the &s;ociety is more to our mind. We are fond of di&s;tinctions; we place our&s;elves in oppo&s;ition, and quarrel under the denominations of faction and party, without any material &s;ubject of controver&s;y. Aver&s;ion, like affection, is fo&s;tered by a continued direction to its particular object. Separation and e&s;trangement, as well as oppo&s;ition, widen a breach which did not owe its beginnings to any offence. And it would &s;eem, that till we have reduced mankind to the &s;tate of a family, or found &s;ome external con&s;i|deration to maintain their connection in greater numbers, they will be for ever &s;eparated into bands, and form a plurality of nations.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of a common danger, and the a&s;|&s;aults of an enemy, have been frequently u&s;eful to nations, by uniting their members more firmly together, and by preventing the &s;ece&s;&s;ions and
<PB N="32" REF="39">
actual &s;eparations in which their civil di&s;cord might otherwi&s;e terminate. And this motive to union which is offered from abroad, may be nece&s;&s;ary, not only in the ca&s;e of large and exten&s;ive na|tions, where coalitions are weakened by di&s;tance, and the di&s;tinction of provincial names; but even in the narrow &s;ociety of the &s;malle&s;t &s;tates. Rome it&s;elf was founded by a &s;mall party, which took its flight from Alba; her citizens were often in danger of &s;eparating; and if the villages and can|tons of the Vol&s;ci had been further removed from the &s;cene of their di&s;&s;en&s;ions, the Mons Sacer might have received a new colony before the mother-country was ripe for &s;uch a di&s;charge. She continued long to feel the quarrels of her no|bles and her people; and the gates of Janus were frequently opened, to remind her inhabitants of the duties they owed to their country.</P>
<P>IF &s;ocieties, as well as individuals, be charged with the care of their own pre&s;ervation, and if in both we apprehend a &s;eparation of intere&s;t, which may give ri&s;e to jealou&s;ies and competitions, we cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed to find ho&s;tilities ari&s;e from this &s;ource. But were there no angry pa&s;&s;ions of a different &s;ort, the animo&s;ities which attend an oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, &s;hould bear a proportion to the &s;uppo&s;ed value of the &s;ubject.
<Q>The Hot|tentot nations,</Q> &s;ays Kolben, <Q>tre&s;pa&s;s on one another by thefts of cattle and of women; but &s;uch injuries are &s;eldom committed, except with a view to exa&s;perate their neighbours, and bring them to a war.</Q>
Such depredations then are not the foundation of a war, but the effects of a ho&s;tile intention already conceived. The na|tions of North America, who have no herds to pre&s;erve, nor &s;ettlements to defend, are yet en|gaged
<PB N="33" REF="40">
in almo&s;t perpetual wars, for which they can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on, but the point of honour, and a de&s;ire to continue the &s;truggle their fathers main|tained. They do not regard the &s;poils of an enemy; and the warrior who has &s;eized any booty, ea&s;ily parts with it to the fir&s;t per&s;on who comes in his way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Charlevoix's hi&s;tory of Canada.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT we need not cro&s;s the Atlantic to find proofs of animo&s;ity, and to ob&s;erve, in the colli&s;ion of &s;eparate &s;ocieties, the influence of angry pa&s;|&s;ions, that do not ari&s;e from an oppo&s;ition of in|tere&s;t. Human nature has no part of its cha|racter, of which more flagrant examples are given on this &s;ide of the globe. What is it that &s;tirs in the brea&s;ts of ordinary men when the enemies of their country are named? Whence are the pre|judices that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between different provinces, cantons, and villages, of the &s;ame empire and territory? What is it that excites one half of the nations of Europe again&s;t the other? The &s;tate&s;man may explain his conduct on motives of national jealou&s;y and caution, but the people have di&s;likes and antipathies, for which they cannot account. Their mutual reproaches of perfidy and inju&s;tice, like the Hottentot depredations, are but &s;ymptoms of an animo&s;ity, and the language of a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition already conceived. The charge of cowardice and pu&s;illanimity, qualities which the intere&s;ted and cautious enemy &s;hould, of all others, like be&s;t to find in his rival, is urged with aver|&s;ion, and made the ground of di&s;like. Hear the pea&s;ants on different &s;ides of the Alps, and the
<PB N="34" REF="41">
Pyrenees, the Rhine, or the Briti&s;h channel, give vent to their prejudices and national pa&s;&s;ions; it is among them that we find the materials of war and di&s;&s;en&s;ion laid without the direction of govern|ment, and &s;parks ready to kindle into a flame, which the &s;tate&s;man is frequently di&s;po&s;ed to ex|tingui&s;h. The fire will not always catch where his rea&s;ons of &s;tate would direct, nor &s;top where the concurrence of intere&s;t has produced an alli|ance.
<Q>My Father,</Q> &s;aid a Spani&s;h pea&s;ant, <Q>would ri&s;e from his grave, if he could fore&s;ee a war with France.</Q>
What intere&s;t had he, or the bones of his father, in the quarrels of princes?</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations &s;eem to arraign our &s;pe|cies, and to give an unfavourable picture of man|kind; and yet the particulars we have mentioned are con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t amiable qualities of our nature, and often furni&s;h a &s;cene for the exer|ci&s;e of our greate&s;t abilities. They are &s;entiments of genero&s;ity and &s;elf-denial that animate the war|rior in defence of his country; and they are di&s;|po&s;itions mo&s;t favourable to mankind, that be|come the principles of apparent ho&s;tility to men. Every animal is made to delight in the exerci&s;e of his natural talents and forces: The lion and the tyger &s;port with the paw; the hor&s;e delights to commit his mane to the wind, and forgets his pa&s;ture to try his &s;peed in the field; the bull even before his brow is armed, and the lamb while yet an emblem of innocence, have a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;trike with the forehead, and anticipate, in play, the conflicts they are doomed to &s;u&s;tain. Man too is di&s;po&s;ed to oppo&s;ition, and to employ the forces of his nature again&s;t an equal antagoni&s;t; he loves to bring his rea&s;on, his eloquence, his
<PB N="35" REF="42">
courage, even his bodily &s;trength, to the proof, His &s;ports are frequently an image of war; &s;weat and blood are freely expended in play: and frac|tures or death are often made to terminate the pa&s;times of idlene&s;s and fe&s;tivity. He was not made to live for ever, and even his love of amu&s;e|ment has opened a path that leads to the grave.</P>
<P>WITHOUT the rival&s;hip of nations, and the practice of war, civil &s;ociety it&s;elf could &s;carcely have found an object, or a form. Mankind might have traded without any formal convention, but they cannot be &s;afe without a national concert. The nece&s;&s;ity of a public defence, has given ri&s;e to many departments of &s;tate, and the intellectual talents of men have found their bu&s;ie&s;t &s;cene in wielding their national forces. To overawe, or intimidate, or, when we cannot per&s;uade with rea&s;on, to re&s;i&s;t with fortitude, are the occupations which give its mo&s;t animating exerci&s;e, and its greate&s;t triumphs, to a vigorous mind; and he who has never &s;truggled with his fellow-creatures, is a &s;tranger to half the &s;entiments of mankind.</P>
<P>THE quarrels of individuals, indeed, are fre|quently the operations of unhappy and dete&s;table pa&s;&s;ions; malice, hatred, and rage. If &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ions alone po&s;&s;e&s;s the brea&s;t, the &s;cene of di&s;&s;en|&s;ion becomes an object of horror; but a common oppo&s;ition maintained by numbers, is always al|layed by pa&s;&s;ions of another &s;ort. Sentiments of affection and friend&s;hip mix with animo&s;ity; the active and &s;trenuous become the guardians of their &s;ociety; and violence it&s;elf is, in their ca&s;e, an exertion of genero&s;ity as well as of courage. We applaud, as proceeding from a national or party
<PB N="36" REF="43">
&s;pirit, what we could not endure as the effect of a private di&s;like; and amid&s;t the competitions of rival &s;tates, think we have found, for the patriot and the warrior, in the practice of violence and &s;tratagem, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious career of human virtue. Even per&s;onal oppo&s;ition here does not divide our judgment on the merits of men. The rival names of Age&s;ilaus and Epaminondas, of Scipio and Hannibal, are repeated with equal prai&s;e; and war it&s;elf, which in one view appears &s;o fatal, in another is the exerci&s;e of a liberal &s;pirit; and in the very effects which we regret, is but one di&s;temper more by which the author of nature has appointed our exit from human life.</P>
<P>THESE reflections may open our view into the &s;tate of mankind; but they tend to reconcile us to the conduct of Providence, rather than to make us change our own: where, from a regard to the welfare of our fellow-creatures, we endeavour to pacify their animo&s;ities, and unite them by the ties of affection. In the pur&s;uit of this amiable intention, we may hope, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to di&s;|arm the angry pa&s;&s;ions of jealou&s;y and envy; we may hope to in&s;til into the brea&s;ts of private men &s;entiments of candour toward their fellow|creatures, and a di&s;po&s;ition to humanity and ju&s;|tice. But it is vain to expect that we can give to the multitude of a people a &s;en&s;e of union among them&s;elves, without admitting ho&s;tility to tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them. Could we at once, in the ca&s;e of any nation, extingui&s;h the emulation which is excited from abroad, we &s;hould pro|bably break or weaken the bands of &s;ociety at home, and clo&s;e the bu&s;ie&s;t &s;cenes of national oc|cupations and virtues.</P>

<HEAD>Of Intellectual Powers.</HEAD>
<P>MANY attempts have been made to analyze the di&s;po&s;itions which we have now enu|merated; but one purpo&s;e of &s;cience, perhaps the mo&s;t important, is &s;erved, when the exi&s;tence of a di&s;po&s;ition is e&s;tabli&s;hed. We are more con|cerned in its reality, and in its con&s;equences, than we are in its origin, or manner of formation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be applied to the other powers and faculties of our nature. Their exi&s;tence and u&s;e are the principal objects of our &s;tudy. Thinking and rea&s;oning, we &s;ay, are the operations of &s;ome faculty; but in what manner the faculties of thought or rea&s;on remain, when they are not exerted, or by what difference in the frame they are unequal in different per&s;ons, are que&s;tions which we cannot re&s;olve. Their ope|rations alone di&s;cover them: when unapplied, they lie hid even from the per&s;on to whom they per|tain; and their action is &s;o much a part of their nature, that the faculty it&s;elf, in many ca&s;es, is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a habit acquired in its frequent exertion.</P>
<P>PERSONS who are occupied with different &s;ubjects, who act in different &s;cenes, generally appear to have different talents, or at lea&s;t to have the &s;ame faculties variou&s;ly formed, and &s;uited to different purpo&s;es. The peculiar genius of na|tions, as well as of individuals, may in this man|ner ari&s;e from the &s;tate of their fortunes. And
<PB N="38" REF="45">
it is proper that we endeavour to find &s;ome rule, by which to judge of what is admirable in the ca|pacities of men, or fortunate in the application of their faculties, before we venture to pa&s;s a judgment on this branch of their merits, or pre|tend to mea&s;ure the degree of re&s;pect they may claim by their different attainments.</P>
<P>TO receive the informations of &s;en&s;e, is per|haps the earlie&s;t function of an animal combined with an intellectual nature; and one great accom|pli&s;hment of the living agent con&s;i&s;ts in the force and &s;en&s;ibility of his animal organs. The plea|&s;ures or pains to which he is expo&s;ed from this quarter, con&s;titute to him an important difference between the objects which are thus brought to his knowledge; and it concerns him to di&s;tingui&s;h well, before he commits him&s;elf to the direction of appetite. He mu&s;t &s;crutinize the objects of one &s;en&s;e by the perceptions of another; examine with the eye, before he ventures to touch; and employ every means of ob&s;ervation, be|fore he gratifies the appetites of thir&s;t and of hunger. A di&s;cernment acquired by experience, becomes a faculty of his mind; and the infe|rences of thought are &s;ometimes not to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the perceptions of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE objects around us, be&s;ide their &s;eparate appearances, have their relations to one another. They &s;ugge&s;t, when compared, what would not occur when they are con&s;idered apart; they have their effects, and mutual influences; they exhi|bit, in like circum&s;tances, &s;imilar operations, and uniform con&s;equences. When we have found and expre&s;&s;ed the points in which the uniformity
<PB N="39" REF="46">
of their operations con&s;i&s;ts, we have a&s;certained a phy&s;ical law. Many &s;uch laws, and even the mo&s;t important, are known to the vulgar, and oc|cur upon the &s;malle&s;t degrees of reflection: but others are hid under a &s;eeming confu&s;ion, which ordinary talents cannot remove; and are therefore the objects of &s;tudy, long ob&s;ervation, and &s;upe|rior capacity. The faculties of penetration and judgement, are, by men of bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as of &s;cience, employed to unravel intricacies of this &s;ort; and the degree of &s;agacity with which either is endowed, is to be mea&s;ured by the &s;ucce&s;s with which they are able to find general rules, applicable to a variety of ca&s;es that &s;eemed to have nothing in common, and to di&s;cover important di|&s;tinctions between &s;ubjects which the vulgar are apt to confound.</P>
<P>TO collect a multiplicity of particulars under general heads, and to refer a variety of operations to their common principle, is the object of &s;cience. To do the &s;ame thing, at lea&s;t within the range of his active engagements, pertains to the man of plea&s;ure, or bu&s;ine&s;s: and it would &s;eem, that the &s;tudious and the active are &s;o far employed in the &s;ame ta&s;k, from ob&s;ervation and experience, to find the general views under which their objects may be con&s;idered, and the rules which may be u&s;efully applied in the detail of their conduct. They do not always apply their talents to different &s;ubjects; and they &s;eem to be di&s;tingui&s;hed chiefly by the unequal reach and variety of their remarks, or by the intentions which they &s;everally have in collecting them.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">
WHILST men continue to act from appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, leading to the attainment of exter|nal ends, they &s;eldom quit the view of their ob|jects in detail, to go far in the road of general inquiries. They mea&s;ure the extent of their own abilities, by the promptitude with which they ap|prehend what is important in every &s;ubject, and the facility with which they extricate them&s;elves on every trying occa&s;ion. And the&s;e, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, to a being who is de&s;tined to act in the mid&s;t of difficulties, are the proper te&s;t of capa|city and force. The parade of words, and gene|ral rea&s;onings, which &s;ometime carry an appear|ance of &s;o much learning and knowledge, are of little avail in the conduct of life. The talents from which they proceed, terminate in mere o&s;ten|tation, and are &s;eldom connected with that &s;upe|rior di&s;cernment which the active apply in times of perplexity; much le&s;s with that intrepidity and force of mind which are required in pa&s;&s;ing through difficult &s;cenes.</P>
<P>THE abilities of active men, however, have a variety corre&s;ponding to that of the &s;ubjects on which they are occupied. A &s;agacity applied to external and inanimate nature, forms one &s;pecies of capacity; that which is turned to &s;ociety and human affairs, another. Reputation for parts in any &s;cene is equivocal, till we know by what kind of exertion that reputation is gained. That they under&s;tand well the &s;ubjects to which they apply, is all that can be &s;aid, in commending men of the greate&s;t abilities: and every department, every profe&s;&s;ion, would have its great men, if there were not a choice of objects for the under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
and of talents for the mind, as well as of &s;entiments for the heart, and of habits for the active character.</P>
<P>THE meane&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, indeed, &s;o far &s;ome|times forget them&s;elves, or the re&s;t of mankind, as to arrogate, in commending what is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in their own way, every epithet the mo&s;t re&s;pectable claim as the right of &s;uperior abilities. Every mechanic is a great man with the learner, and the humble admirer, in his particular calling; and we can, perhaps, with more a&s;&s;urance pro|nounce what it is that &s;hould make a man happy and amiable, than what &s;hould make his abilities re&s;pected, and his genius admired. This, upon a view of the talents them&s;elves, may perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible. The effect, however, will point out the rule and the &s;tandard of our judgement. To be admired and re&s;pected, is to have an a&s;cendant among men. The talents which mo&s;t directly procure that a&s;cendant, are tho&s;e which operate on mankind, penetrate their views, prevent their wi&s;hes, or &s;ru&s;trate their de&s;igns. The &s;uperior capacity leads with a &s;uperior energy, where every individual would go, and &s;hews the he&s;ita|ting and the irre&s;olute a clear pa&s;&s;age to the at|tainment of their ends.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;cription does not pertain to any par|ticular craft or profe&s;&s;ion; or perhaps it implies a kind of ability, which the &s;eparate application of men to particular callings, only tends to &s;uppre&s;s or to weaken. Where &s;hall we find the talents which are fit to act with men in a collective body, if we break that body into parts, and confine the ob&s;ervation of each to a &s;eparate track?</P>

TO act in the view of his fellow-creatures, to produce his mind in public, to give it all the exerci&s;e of &s;entiment and thought, which pertain to man as a member of &s;ociety, as a friend, or an enemy, &s;eems to be the principal calling and occupation of his nature. If he mu&s;t labour, that he may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, he can &s;ub&s;i&s;t for no better pur|po&s;e than the good of mankind; nor can he have better talents than tho&s;e which qualify him to act with men. Here, indeed, the under&s;tanding ap|pears to borrow very much from the pa&s;&s;ions; and there is a felicity of conduct in human affairs, in which it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the promptitude of the head from the ardour and &s;en&s;ibility of the heart. Where both are united, they con&s;titute that &s;uperiority of mind, the frequency of which among men, in particular ages and nations, much more than the progre&s;s they have made in &s;pecu|lation, or in the practice of mechanic and liberal arts, &s;hould determine the rate of their genius, and a&s;&s;ign the palm of di&s;tinction and honour.</P>

MEN are to be e&s;timated, not from what they know, but from what they are able to perform; from their &s;kill in adapting materials to the &s;eve|ral purpo&s;es of life; from their vigour and con|duct in pur&s;uing the objects of policy, and in finding the expedients of war and national de|fence. Even in literature, they are to be e&s;ti|mated from the works of their genius, not from the extent of their knowledge. The &s;cene of mere ob&s;ervation was extremely limited in a Grecian republic; and the bu&s;tle of an active life appeared incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;tudy: but there the human mind, notwith&s;tanding, collected its greate&s;t abi|lities, and received its be&s;t informations, in the mid&s;t of &s;weat and of du&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is peculiar to modern Europe, to re&s;t &s;o much of the human character on what may be learned in retirement, and from the information of books. A ju&s;t admiration of ancient literature, an opinion that human &s;entiment, and human rea|&s;on, without this aid, were to have vani&s;hed from the &s;ocieties of men, have led us into the &s;hade, where we endeavour to derive from imagination and thought, what is in reality matter of experience and &s;entiment: and we endeavour, through the grammar of dead languages, and the channel of commentators, to arrive at the beauties of thought and elocution, which &s;prang from the animated &s;pirit of &s;ociety, and were taken from the living impre&s;&s;ions of an active life. Our attainments are frequently limited to the elements of every &s;ci|ence, and &s;eldom reach to that enlargement of ability and power which u&s;eful knowledge &s;hould give. Like mathematicians, who &s;tudy the Ele|ments
<PB N="44" REF="51">
of Euclid, but never think of men&s;uration, we read of &s;ocieties, but do not propo&s;e to act with men: we repeat the language of politics, but feel not the &s;pirit of nations: we attend to the formalities of a military di&s;cipline, but know not how to employ numbers of men to obtain any purpo&s;e by &s;tratagem or force.</P>
<P>BUT for what end, it may be &s;aid, is it to point out a misfortune that cannot be remedied? If nati|onal affairs called for exertion, the genius of men would awake; but in the rece&s;s of better em|ployment, the time which is be&s;towed on &s;tudy, if even attended with no other advantage, &s;erves to occupy with innocence the hours of lei&s;ure, and &s;et bounds to the pur&s;uit of ruinous and frivolous amu&s;ements. From no better rea&s;on than this, we employ &s;o many of our early years, under the rod, to acquire what it is not expected we &s;hould retain beyond the thre&s;hold of the &s;chool; and whil&s;t we carry the &s;ame frivolous character in our &s;tudies that we do in our amu&s;ements, the human mind could not &s;uffer more from a con|tempt of letters, than it does from the fal&s;e im|portance which is given to literature, as a bu&s;i|ne&s;s for life, not as a help to our conduct, and the means of forming a character that may be happy in it&s;elf, and u&s;eful to mankind.</P>

<P>UPON a &s;light ob&s;ervation of what pa&s;&s;es in human life, we &s;hould be apt to conclude, that the care of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is the principal &s;pring of human actions. This con&s;ideration leads to the invention and practice of mechanical arts; it &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h amu&s;ement from bu&s;ine&s;s; and, with many, &s;carcely admits into competition any other &s;ubject of pur&s;uit or attention. The mighty ad|vantages of property and fortune, when &s;tript of the recommendations they derive from vanity, or the more &s;erious regards to independence and pow|er, only mean a provi&s;ion that is made for animal enjoyment; and if our &s;olicitude on this &s;ubject were removed, not only the toils of the mechanic, but the &s;tudies of the learned, would cea&s;e; every department of public bu&s;ine&s;s would become unne|ce&s;&s;ary; every &s;enate-hou&s;e would be &s;hut up, and every palace de&s;erted.</P>
<P>IS man therefore, in re&s;pect to his object, to be cla&s;&s;ed with the mere brutes, and only to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed by faculties that qualify him to multi|ply contrivances for the &s;upport and convenience of animal life, and by the extent of a fancy that ren|ders the care of animal pre&s;ervation to him more burden&s;ome than it is to the herd with which he &s;hares in the bounty of nature? If this were his ca&s;e, the joy which attends on &s;ucce&s;s, or the griefs which ari&s;e from di&s;appointment, would make the &s;um of his pa&s;&s;ions. The torrent that wa&s;ted, or
<PB N="47" REF="54">
the inundation that enriched his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, would give him all the emotion with which he is &s;eized, on the occa&s;ion of a wrong by which his fortunes are impaired, or of a benefit by which they are pre&s;erved and enlarged. His fellow-creatures would be con&s;idered merely as they affected his intere&s;t. Profit or lo&s;s would &s;erve to mark the event of every tran&s;action; and the epithets <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>detrimental</HI> would &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h his mates in &s;ociety, as they do the tree which bears plenty of fruit, from that which &s;erves only to cumber the ground, or intercept his view.</P>
<P>THIS, however, is not the hi&s;tory of our &s;pe|cies. What comes from a fellow-creature is re|ceived with peculiar attention; and every lan|guage abounds with terms that expre&s;s &s;omewhat in the tran&s;actions of men, different from &s;ucce&s;s and di&s;appointment. The bo&s;om kindles in com|pany, while the point of intere&s;t in view has no|thing to inflame; and a matter frivolous in it&s;elf, becomes important, when it &s;erves to bring to light the intentions and characters of men. The &s;o|reigner, who believed that Othello, on the &s;tage, was enraged for the lo&s;s of his handkerchief, was not more mi&s;taken, than the rea&s;oner who im|putes any of the more vehement pa&s;&s;ions of men to the impre&s;&s;ions of mere profit or lo&s;s.</P>
<P>MEN a&s;&s;emble to deliberate on bu&s;ine&s;s; they &s;eparate from jealou&s;ies of intere&s;t; but in their &s;everal colli&s;ions, whether as friends or as enemies, a fire is &s;truck out which the regards to intere&s;t or &s;afety cannot confine.

<P>AS actors or &s;pectators, we are perpetually made to feel the difference of human conduct, and from a bare recital of tran&s;actions which have pa&s;&s;ed in ages and countries remote from our own, are moved with admiration and pity, or tran&s;ported with indignation and rage. Our &s;en&s;ibility on this &s;ubject gives their charm, in retirement, to the re|lations of hi&s;tory, and to the fictions of poetry; &s;ends forth the tear of compa&s;&s;ion, gives to the blood its bri&s;ke&s;t movement, and to the eye its live|lie&s;t glances of di&s;plea&s;ure or joy. It turns human life into an intere&s;ting &s;pectacle, and perpetually &s;olicits even the indolent to mix, as opponents or friends, in the &s;cenes which are acted before them. Joined to the powers of deliberation and rea&s;on, it con&s;titutes the ba&s;is of a moral nature; and whil&s;t it dictates the terms of prai&s;e and of blame, &s;erves to cla&s;s our fellow-creatures by the mo&s;t admirable and engaging, or the mo&s;t odious and contemp|tible, denominations.</P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ant to find men, who, in their &s;pecu|lations, deny the reality of moral di&s;tinctions, for|get in detail the general po&s;itions they maintain, and give loo&s;e to ridicule, indignation, and &s;corn, as if any of the&s;e &s;entiments could have place, were the actions of men indifferent; and with acrimo|ny pretend to detect the fraud by which moral re|&s;traints have been impo&s;ed, as if to cen&s;ure a fraud were not already to take a part on the &s;ide of mo|rality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mandeville.</NOTE>.</P>

CAN we explain the principles upon which mankind adjudge the preference of characters, and upon which they indulge &s;uch vehement emotions of admiration or contempt?

with the &s;en&s;e of our exi&s;tence, we mu&s;t admit many circum&s;tances which come to our knowledge at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame manner; and which do, in reality, con&s;titute the mode of our being.

<P>THE rights of individuals may relate to a va|riety of &s;ubjects, and be comprehended under dif|ferent heads.

IT may be difficult, however, to enumerate the motives of all the cen&s;ures and commendations which are applied to the actions of men.

As jealou&s;y is often the mo&s;t watchful guardian of cha&s;tity, &s;o malice is often the quicke&s;t to &s;py the failings of our neighbour. Envy, affectation, and vanity, may dictate the verdicts we give, and the wor&s;t prin|ciples of our nature may be at the bottom of our pretended zeal for morality; but if we only mean to inquire, why they who are well di&s;po&s;ed to man|kind, apprehend, in every in&s;tance, certain rights pertaining to their fellow-creatures, and why they applaud the con&s;ideration that is paid to tho&s;e rights, we cannot perhaps a&s;&s;ign a better rea&s;on, than that the per&s;on who applauds, is well di&s;po|&s;ed to the welfare of the parties to whom his ap|plau&s;es refer.</P>

WHEN we con&s;ider, that the reality of any amicable propen&s;ity in the human mind has been frequently conte&s;ted; when we recollect the pre|valence of intere&s;ted competitions, with their at|tendant pa&s;&s;ions of jealou&s;y, envy, and malice; it may &s;eem &s;trange to alledge, that love and com|pa&s;&s;ion are the mo&s;t powerful principles in the hu|man brea&s;t: but they are de&s;tined, on many oc|ca&s;ions, to urge with the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible vehe|mence; and if the de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation be more con&s;tant, and more uniform, the&s;e are a more plentiful &s;ource of enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;atisfaction, and joy.

<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition on which friend&s;hip is grafted, glows with &s;atisfaction in the hours of tranquillity, and is plea&s;ant, not only in its triumphs, but even in its &s;orrows.

From this &s;ource the &s;cenes of human life derive their principal felicity; and their imitations in poetry, their principal ornament. De&s;criptions of nature, even repre&s;entations of a vigorous conduct, and a manly courage, do not engage the heart, if they be not mixed with the exhibition of generous &s;en|timents, and the pathetic, which is found to ari&s;e in the &s;truggles, the triumphs, or the misfortunes of a tender affection.

To be able to follow the dictates of &s;uch a Spirit through all the varieties of human life, and with a mind always ma&s;ter of it&s;elf, in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all its abilities, when the &s;ubjects in hazard are life, or freedom, as much as in treat|ing &s;imple que&s;tions of intere&s;t, are the triumphs of magnanimity, and true elevation of mind.

<P>IN what &s;ituation, or by what in&s;truction, is this wonderful character to be formed? Is it found in the nur&s;eries of affectation, pertne&s;s, and vani|ty, from which fa&s;hion is propagated, and the genteel is announced? in great and opulent cities, where men view with one another in equipage, dre&s;s, and the reputation of fortune? Is it within the ad|mired precincts of a court, where we may learn to &s;mile without being plea&s;ed, to care&s;s without af|fection, to wound with the &s;ecret weapons of envy and jealou&s;y, and to re&s;t our per&s;onal importance on circum&s;tances which we cannot always with ho|nour command? No: but in a &s;ituation where the great &s;entiments of the heart are awakened; where the characters of men, not their &s;ituations and for|tunes, are the principal di&s;tinction; where the anx|ieties of intere&s;t, or vanity, peri&s;h in the blaze of
<PB N="58" REF="65">
more vigorous emotions; and where the human &s;oul, having felt and recogni&s;ed its objects, like an animal who has ta&s;ted the blood of his prey, can|not de&s;cend to pur&s;uits that leave its talents and its force unemployed.</P>
<P>PROPER occa&s;ions alone operating on a rai&s;ed and a happy di&s;po&s;ition, may produce this admir|able effect, whil&s;t mere in&s;truction may always find mankind at a lo&s;s to comprehend its meaning, or in&s;en&s;ible to its dictates. The ca&s;e however, is not de&s;perate, till we have formed our &s;y&s;tem of politics, as well as manners; till we have &s;old our freedom for titles, equipage, and di&s;tinctions; till we &s;ee no merit but pro&s;perity and power, no di&s;|grace but poverty and neglect. What charm of in&s;truction can cure the mind that is tainted with this di&s;order? What &s;yren voice can awaken a de&s;ire of freedom, that is held to be meanne&s;s, and a want of ambition? or what per&s;ua&s;ion can turn the grimace of politene&s;s into real &s;entiments of humanity and candour?</P>

<HEAD>Of Happine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING had under our con&s;ideration the active powers and the moral qualities which di&s;tingui&s;h the nature of man, is it &s;till nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould treat of his happine&s;s apart? This &s;ignificant term, the mo&s;t frequent, and the mo&s;t familiar, in our conver&s;ation, is, perhaps, on re|flection, the lea&s;t under&s;tood. It &s;erves to expre&s;s our &s;atisfaction, when any de&s;ire is gratified: It is pronounced with a &s;igh, when our object is di&s;tant: It means what we wi&s;h to obtain, and what we &s;el|dom &s;tay to examine. We e&s;timate the value of every &s;ubject by its utility, and its influence on happine&s;s; but we think that utility it&s;elf, and hap|pine&s;s, require no explanation.</P>
<P>THOSE men are commonly e&s;teemed the hap|pie&s;t, who&s;e de&s;ires are mo&s;t frequently gratified. But if, in reality, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we de&s;ire, and a continued fruition, were requi&s;ite to happi|ne&s;s, mankind for the mo&s;t part would have rea|&s;on to complain of their lot. What they call their enjoyments, are generally momentary; and the ob|ject of &s;anguine expectation, when obtained, no longer continues to occupy the mind: A new pa&s;|&s;ion &s;ucceeds, and the imagination, as before, is in|tent on a di&s;tant felicity.</P>
<P>HOW many reflections of this &s;ort are &s;ugge&s;t|ed by melancholy, or by the effects of that very languor and inoccupation into which we would wil|lingly
<PB N="60" REF="67">
&s;ink, under the notion of freedom from care and trouble.</P>
<P>WHEN we enter on a formal computation of the enjoyments or &s;ufferings which are prepared for mankind, it is a chance but we find that pain, by its inten&s;ene&s;s, its duration, or frequency, is greatly predominant. The activity and eagerne&s;s with which we pre&s;s from one &s;tage of life to an|other, our unwillingne&s;s to return on the paths we have trod, our aver&s;ion in age to renew the frolics of youth, or to repeat in manhood the amu&s;ements of children, have been accordingly &s;tated as proofs, that our memory of the pa&s;t, and our feeling of the pre&s;ent, are equal &s;ubjects of di&s;like and di&s;|plea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maupertuis; E&s;&s;ai de Morale.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS conclu&s;ion, however, like many others, drawn from our &s;uppo&s;ed knowledge of cau&s;es, does not corre&s;pond with experience. In every &s;treet, in every village, in every field, the greater num|ber of per&s;ons we meet, carry an a&s;pect that is chearful or thoughtle&s;s, indifferent, compo&s;ed, bu&s;y, or animated. The labourer whi&s;tles to his team, and the mechanic is at ea&s;e in his calling; the frolic&s;ome and the gay feel a &s;eries of plea&s;ures, of which we know not the &s;ource; even they who demon&s;trate the mi&s;eries of human life, when in|tent on their argument, e&s;cape from their &s;orrows, and find a tolerable pa&s;time in proving that men are unhappy.</P>
<P>THE very terms <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>pain,</HI> perhaps, are equivocal; but if they are confined, as they
<PB N="61" REF="68">
appear to be in many of our rea&s;onings, to the mere &s;en&s;ations which have a reference to exter|nal objects, either in the memory of the pa&s;t, the feeling of the pre&s;ent, or the apprehen&s;ion of the future, it is a great error to &s;uppo&s;e, that they comprehend all the con&s;tituents of happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery; or that the good humour of an ordinary life is maintained by the prevalence of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which have their &s;eparate names, and are on re|flection, di&s;tinctly remembered.</P>
<P>THE mind, during the greater part of its ex|i&s;tence, is employed in active exertions, not in merely attending to its own feelings of plea&s;ure or pain; and the li&s;t of its faculties, under&s;tanding, memory, fore&s;ight, &s;entiment, will, and intenti|on, only contains the names of its different opera|tions.</P>
<P>IF, in the ab&s;ence of every &s;en&s;ation to which we commonly give the names either of <HI>enjoyment</HI> or <HI>&s;uffering,</HI> our very exi&s;tence may have its oppo|&s;ite qualities of <HI>bappine&s;s</HI> or <HI>mi&s;ery</HI>; and if what we call <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> or <HI>pain,</HI> occupies but a &s;mall part of human life, compared to what pa&s;&s;es in con|trivance and execution, in pur&s;uits and expecta|tions, in conduct, reflection, and &s;ocial engage|ments; it mu&s;t appear, that our active pur&s;uits, at lea&s;t on account of their duration, de&s;erve the greater part of our attention. When their occa&s;i|ons have failed, the demand is not for plea&s;ure, but for &s;omething to do; and the very complaints of a &s;ufferer are not &s;o &s;ure a mark of di&s;tre&s;s, as the &s;tare of the languid.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">
WE &s;eldom, however, reckon any ta&s;k which we are bound to perform, among the ble&s;&s;ings of life. We always aim at a period of pure enjoy|ment, or a termination of trouble; and overlook the &s;ource from which mo&s;t of our pre&s;ent &s;atis|factions are really drawn. A&s;k the bu&s;y, Where is the happine&s;s to which they a&s;pire? they will an&s;wer, perhaps, That it is to be found in the ob|ject of &s;ome pre&s;ent pur&s;uit. If we a&s;k, Why they are not mi&s;erable in the ab&s;ence of that happine&s;s? they will &s;ay, That they hope to attain it. But is it hope alone that &s;upports the mind in the mid&s;t of precarious and uncertain pro&s;pects? and would a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s fill the intervals of expecta|tion with more plea&s;ing emotions? Give the hunt&s;|man his prey, give the game&s;ter the gold which is &s;taked on the game, that the one may not need to fatigue his per&s;on, nor the other to perplex his mind, and both will probably laugh at our folly: the one will &s;take his money anew, that he may be perplexed; the other will turn his &s;tag to the field, that he may hear the cry of the dogs, and follow through danger and hard&s;hip. Withdraw the oc|cupations of men, terminate their de&s;ires, exi&s;tence is a burden, and the iteration of memory is a tor|ment.</P>
<P>THE men of this country, &s;ays one lady, &s;hould learn to &s;ow and to knit; it would hinder their time from being a burden to them&s;elves, and to other people. That is true, &s;ays another; for my part, though I never look abroad, I tremble at the pro&s;|pect of bad weather; for then the gentlemen come mopping to us for entertainment; and the &s;ight of a hu&s;band in di&s;tre&s;s, is but a melancholy &s;pectacle.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="70">
IN devi&s;ing, or in executing a plan, in being carried on the tide of emotion and &s;entiment, the mind &s;eems to unfold its being, and to enjoy it&s;elf. Even where the end and the object are known to be of little avail, the talents and the fancy are of|ten inten&s;ely applied, and bu&s;ine&s;s or play may amu&s;e them alike. We only de&s;ire repo&s;e to re|cruit our limited and our wa&s;ting force: when bu&s;ine&s;s fatigues, amu&s;ement is often but a change of occupation. We are not always unhappy, even when we complain. There is a kind of affliction which makes an agreeable &s;tate of the mind; and lamentation it&s;elf is &s;ometimes an expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure. The painter and the poet have laid hold of this handle, and find, among the means of en|tertainment, a favourable reception for works that are compo&s;ed to awaken our &s;orrows.</P>
<P>TO a being of this de&s;cription, therefore, it is a ble&s;&s;ing to meet with incentives to action, whether in the de&s;ire of plea&s;ure, or the aver&s;ion to pain. His activity is of more importance than the very plea&s;ure he &s;eeks, and langour a greater evil than the &s;uffering he &s;huns.</P>
<P>THE gratifications of animal appetite are of &s;hort duration; and &s;en&s;uality is but a di&s;temper of the mind, which ought to be cured by remem|brance, if it were not perpetually inflamed by hope. The chace is not more &s;urely terminated by the death of the game, than the joys of the volup|tuary by the means of completing his debauch. As a bond of &s;ociety, as a matter of di&s;tant pur|&s;uit, the objects of &s;en&s;e make an important part in the &s;y&s;tem of human life. They lead us to
<PB N="64" REF="71">
fulfil the purpo&s;e of nature, in pre&s;erving the in|dividual, and in perpetuating the &s;pecies: but to rely on their u&s;e as a principal con&s;tituent of hu|man felicity, were an error in &s;peculation, and would be &s;till more an error in practice. Even the ma&s;ter of the &s;eraglio, for whom all the trea|&s;ures of empire are extorted from the hoards of its frighted inhabitants, for whom alone the choice&s;t emerald and the diamond are drawn from the mine, for whom every breeze is enriched with per|fumes, for whom beauty is a&s;&s;embled from every quarter, and, animated by pa&s;&s;ions that ripen un|der the vertical &s;un, is confined to the grate for his u&s;e, is &s;till, perhaps, more wretched than the very herd of the people, who&s;e labours and pro|perties are devoted to relieve him of trouble, and to procure him enjoyment.</P>
<P>SENSUALITY is ea&s;ily overcome by any of the habits of pur&s;uit which u&s;ually engage an active mind. When curio&s;ity is awake, or when pa&s;&s;ion is excited, even in the mid&s;t of the fea&s;t when conver&s;ation grows warm, grows jovial, or &s;eri|ous, the plea&s;ures of the table we know are for|gotten. The boy contemns them for play, and the man of age declines them for bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN we reckon the circum&s;tances that cor|re&s;pond to the nature of any animal, or to that of man in particular, &s;uch as &s;afety, &s;helter, food, and the other means of enjoyment or pre&s;ervation, we &s;ometimes think that we have found a &s;en&s;ible and a &s;olid foundation on which to re&s;t his felicity. But tho&s;e who are lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to moralize, ob&s;erve, that happine&s;s is not connected with for|tune, although fortune includes at once all the
<PB N="65" REF="72">
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the means of &s;en&s;ual in|dulgence. The circum&s;tances that require ab&s;ti|nence, courage, and conduct, expo&s;e us to hazard, and are in de&s;cription of the painful kind; yet the able, the brave, and the ardent, &s;eem mo&s;t to en|joy them&s;elves when placed in the mid&s;t of dif|ficulties, and obliged to employ the powers they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

How many are there to whom war it&s;elf is a pa&s;time, who chu&s;e the life of a &s;oldier, expo&s;ed to dangers and con|tinued fatigues; of a mariner, in conflict with every hard&s;hip, and bereft of every conveniency; of a politician, who&s;e &s;port is the conduct of par|ties and factions; and who, rather than be idle, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s of men and of nations for whom he has not the &s;malle&s;t regard. Such men do not chu&s;e pain as preferable to plea&s;ure, but they are incited by a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to make continued exertions of capacity and re&s;olution; they triumph in the mid&s;t of their &s;truggles; they droop, and they langui&s;h, when the occa&s;ion of their labour has cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHAT was enjoyment, in the &s;en&s;e of that youth, who, according to Tacitus, loved danger it&s;elf, not the rewards of courage? What is the pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure, when the &s;ound of the horn or the trumpet, the cry of the dogs, or the &s;hout of war, awaken the ardour of the &s;port&s;man and
<PB N="66" REF="73">
the &s;oldier? The mo&s;t animating occa&s;ions of hu|man life, are calls to danger and hard&s;hip, not in|vitations to &s;afety and ea&s;e: and man him&s;elf, in his excellence, is not an animal of plea&s;ure, nor de&s;tined merely to enjoy what the elements bring to his u&s;e; but, like his a&s;&s;ociates, the dog and the hor&s;e, to follow the exerci&s;es of his nature, in preference to what are called its enjoyments; to pine in the lap of ea&s;e and of affluence, and to ex|ult in the mid&s;t of alarms that &s;eem to threaten his being. In all which, his di&s;po&s;ition to action only keeps pace with the variety of powers with which he is furni&s;hed; and the mo&s;t re&s;pectable attributes of his nature, magnanimity, fortitude, and wi&s;dom, carry a manife&s;t reference to the dif|ficulties with which he is de&s;tined to &s;truggle.</P>
<P>IF animal plea&s;ure becomes in&s;ipid when the &s;pirit is rou&s;ed by a different object, it is well known likewi&s;e, that the &s;en&s;e of pain is prevented by any vehement affection of the &s;oul. Wounds received in a heat of pa&s;&s;ion, in the hurry, the ardour, or con&s;ternation of battle, are never felt till the fer|ment of the mind &s;ub&s;ides. Even torment, delibe|rately applied, and indu&s;triou&s;ly prolonged, are borne with firmne&s;s, and with an appearance of ea&s;e, when the mind is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ome vigor|ous &s;entiment, whether of religion, enthu&s;ia&s;m, or love to mankind. The continued mortifications of &s;uper&s;titious devotees in &s;everal ages of the Chri&s;ti|an church; the wild penances, &s;till voluntarily borne, during many years, by the religioni&s;ts of the ea&s;t; the contempt in which famine and tor|ture are held by mo&s;t &s;avage nations; the chear|ful or ob&s;tinate patience of the &s;oldier in the field; the hard&s;hips endured by the &s;port&s;man in his pa&s;|time,
<PB N="67" REF="74">
&s;how how much we may err in computing the mi&s;eries of men, from the mea&s;ures of trou|ble and of &s;uffering they &s;eem to incur. And if there be a refinement in affirming, that their hap|pine&s;s is not to be mea&s;ured by the contrary en|joyments, it is a refinement which was made by Regulus and Cincinnatus before the date of phi|lo&s;ophy; it is a refinement, which every boy knows at his play, and every &s;avage confirms, when he looks from his fore&s;t on the pacific city, and &s;corns the plantation, who&s;e ma&s;ter he cares not to imitate.</P>
<P>MAN, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding all this activity of his mind, is an animal in the full extent of that de&s;ignation. When the body &s;ickens, the mind droops; and when the blood cea&s;es to flow, the &s;oul takes its departure. Charged with the care of his pre&s;ervation, admoni&s;hed by a &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure or pain, and guarded by an in|&s;tinctive fear of death, nature has not intru&s;ted his &s;afety to the mere vigilance of his under&s;tanding, nor to the government of his uncertain reflections.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinction betwixt mind and body is followed by con&s;equences of the greate&s;t impor|tance; but the facts to which we now refer, are not founded on any tenets whatever. They are equally true, whether we admit or reject the di|&s;tinction in que&s;tion, or whether we &s;uppo&s;e, that this living agent is formed of one, or is an a&s;&s;em|blage of &s;eparate natures. And the materiali&s;t, by treating of man as of an engine, cannot make any change in the &s;tate of his hi&s;tory. He is a being, who, by a multiplicity of vi&s;ible organs, performs a variety of functions. His joints are
<PB N="68" REF="75">
bent, and his mu&s;cles relax and contract in our &s;ight; the heart beats in his brea&s;t, and the blood flows to every part of his frame. He performs other operations which we cannot refer to any cor|poreal organ. He perceives, he recollects, and foreca&s;ts; he de&s;ires, and he &s;huns; he admires, and contemns. He enjoys his plea&s;ures, or he endures his pain. All the&s;e different functions, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, go well or ill together. When the motion of the blood is languid, the mu&s;cles relax, the under&s;tanding is tardy, and the fancy is dull: when di&s;temper a&s;&s;ails him, the phy&s;ician mu&s;t at|tend no le&s;s to what he thinks, than to what he eats, and examines the returns of his pa&s;&s;ion, toge|ther with the &s;trokes of his pul&s;e.</P>
<P>WITH all his &s;agacity, his precautions, and his in&s;tincts, which are given to pre&s;erve his be|ing, he partakes in the fate of other animals, and &s;eems to be formed only that he may die. Myriads peri&s;h before they reach the perfection of their kind; and the individual, with an option to owe the prolongation of his temporary cour&s;e to re&s;o|lution and conduct, or to abject fear, frequently chu&s;es the latter, and by a habit of timidity, im|bitters the life he is &s;o intent to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>MAN, however, at times, exempted from this mortifying lot, &s;eems to act without any regard to the length of his period. When he thinks in|ten&s;ely, or de&s;ires with ardour, plea&s;ures and pains from any other quarter a&s;&s;ail him in vain. Even in his dying hour, the mu&s;cles acquire a tone from his &s;pirit, and the mind &s;eems to depart in its vi|gour, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;truggle to obtain the recent aim of its toils. Muley Moluck, borne on
<PB N="69" REF="76">
his litter, and &s;pent with di&s;ea&s;e, &s;till fought the battle, in the mid&s;t of which he expired; and the la&s;t effort he made, with a finger on his lips, was a &s;ignal to conceal his death: the precaution, per|haps, of all which he had hitherto taken, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to prevent a defeat.</P>
<P>CAN no reflections aid us in acquiring this h&aacute;bit of the &s;oul, &s;o u&s;eful in carrying us through many of the ordinary &s;cenes of life? If we &s;ay, that they cannot, the reality of its happine&s;s is not the le&s;s evident. The Greeks and the Romans con&s;idered contempt of plea&s;ure, endurance of pain, and neglect of life, as eminent qualities of a man, and a principal &s;ubject of di&s;cipline. They tru&s;ted, that the vigorous &s;pirit would find worthy objects on which to employ its force; and that the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a re&s;olute choice of &s;uch ob|jects was to &s;hake off the meanne&s;s of a &s;olicitous and timorous mind.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in general, have courted occa&s;ions to di&s;play their courage, and frequently, in &s;earch of admiration, have pre&s;ented a &s;pectacle, which to tho&s;e who have cea&s;ed to regard fortitude on its own account, becomes a &s;ubject of horror. Scevola held his arm in the fire, to &s;hake the &s;oul of Por&s;enna. The &s;avage inures his body to the torture, that in the hour of trial he may exult over his enemy. Even the Mu&s;&s;ulman tears his fle&s;h to win the heart of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and comes in gaiety, &s;treaming with blood, to &s;hew that he de&s;erves her e&s;teem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters of the Right Hon.

<P>WHOEVER has compared together the dif|ferent conditions and manners of men, under varieties of education or fortune, will be &s;atisfied, that mere &s;ituation does not con&s;titute their happine&s;s or mi&s;ery; nor a diver&s;ity of ex|ternal ob&s;ervances imply any oppo&s;ition of &s;enti|ments on the &s;ubject of morality. They expre&s;s their kindne&s;s and their enmity in different actions; but kindne&s;s or enmity is &s;till the principal article of con&s;ideration in human life. They engage in different pur&s;uits, or acquie&s;ce in different con|ditions; but act from pa&s;&s;ions nearly the &s;ame. There is no preci&s;e mea&s;ure of accommodation required to &s;uit their conveniency, nor any de|gree of danger or &s;afety under which they are pe|culiarly fitted to act. Courage and genero&s;ity, fear and envy, are not peculiar to any &s;tation or order of men; nor is there any condition in which &s;ome of the human race have not &s;hewn, that it is po&s;&s;ible to employ, with propriety, the talents and virtues of their &s;pecies.</P>
<P>WHAT, then, is that my&s;terious thing called <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> which may have place in &s;uch a variety of &s;tations, and to which circum&s;tances in one age or nation thought nece&s;&s;ary, are in another held to be de&s;tructive, or of no effect?

in the duration of life. On too frequent a repetition, tho&s;e plea&s;ures turn to &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t; they tear the con&s;titution to which they are applied in exce&s;s, and, like the lightning of night, only &s;erve to darken the gloom through which they occa|&s;ionally break. Happine&s;s is not that &s;tate of re|po&s;e, or that imaginary freedom from care, which at a di&s;tance is &s;o frequent an object of de&s;ire, but with its approach brings a tedium, or a lan|guor, more un&s;upportable than pain it&s;elf. If the preceding ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject be ju&s;t, it ari&s;es more from the pur&s;uit, than from the at|tainment of any end whatever; and in every new &s;ituation to which we arrive, even in the cour&s;e of a pro&s;perous life, it depends more on the degree in which our minds are properly employed, than it does on the circum&s;tances in which we are de|&s;tined to act, on the materials which are placed in our hands, or the tools with which we are fur|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>IF this be confe&s;&s;ed in re&s;pect to that cla&s;s of pur&s;uits which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> and which, in the ca&s;e of men who are commonly deemed the mo&s;t happy, occupy the greater part of human life, we may appre|hend, that it holds, much more than is commonly &s;u&s;pected, in many ca&s;es of bu&s;ine&s;s, where the end to be gained, and not the occupation, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have the principal value.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;er him&s;elf, we are told, can &s;ome|times con&s;ider the care of his wealth as a pa&s;time, and has challenged his heir, to have more plea|&s;ure in &s;pending, than he in ama&s;&s;ing his fortune. With this degree of indifference to what may be

the conduct of others; with this confinement of his care to what he has cho&s;en as his own pro|vince, more e&s;pecially if he has conquered in him|&s;elf the pa&s;&s;ions of jealou&s;y and envy, which tear the covetous mind; why may not the man who&s;e object is money, be under&s;tood to lead a life of amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure, not only more entire than that of the &s;pendthrift, but even as much as the virtuo&s;o, the &s;cholar, the man of ta&s;te, or any of that cla&s;s of per&s;ons who have found out a me|thod of pa&s;&s;ing their lei&s;ure without offence, and to whom the acqui&s;itions made, or the works pro|duced, in their &s;everal ways, perhaps, are as u&s;e|le&s;s as the bag to the mi&s;er, or the counter to tho&s;e who play from mere di&s;&s;ipation at any game of &s;kill or of chance?</P>
<P>WE are &s;oon tired of diver&s;ions that do not approach to the nature of bu&s;ine&s;s, that is, that do not engage &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, or give an exerci&s;e proportioned to our talents, and our faculties. The chace and the gaming-table have each their dangers and difficulties, to excite and employ the mind. All games of contention animate our emu|lation, and give a &s;pecies of party-zeal. The ma|thematician is only to be amu&s;ed with intricate problems, the lawyer and the ca&s;ui&s;t with ca&s;es that try their &s;ubtilty, and occupy their judge|ment.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire of active engagements, like every other natural appetite, may be carried to exce&s;s; and men may debauch in amu&s;ements, as well as in the u&s;e of wine, or other intoxicating liquors. At fir&s;t, a trifling &s;take, and the occupation of a moderate pa&s;&s;ion, may have &s;erved to amu&s;e the
<PB N="74" REF="81">
game&s;ter; but when the drug becomes familiar, it fails to produce its effect: The play is made deep, and the intere&s;t increa&s;ed, to awaken his attention; he is carried on by degrees, and in the end comes to &s;eek for amu&s;ement, and to find it only in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of anxiety, hope, and de|&s;pair, which are rou&s;ed by the hazard into which he has thrown the whole of his fortunes.</P>
<P>IF men can thus turn their amu&s;ements into a &s;cene more &s;erious and intere&s;ting than that of bu&s;ine&s;s it&s;elf, it will be difficult to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on, why bu&s;ine&s;s, and many of the occupations of human life, independent of any di&s;tant con&s;equen|ces, or future events, may not be cho&s;en as an amu&s;ement, and adopted on account of the pa&s;|time they bring. This is, perhaps, the founda|tion on which, without the aid of reflection, the contented and the chearful have re&s;ted the gaiety of their tempers. It is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;olid ba&s;is of fortitude which any reflection can lay; and happine&s;s it&s;elf is &s;ecured, by making a cer|tain &s;pecies of conduct our amu&s;ement; and, by con&s;idering life, in the general e&s;timate of its va|lue, as well as on every particular occa&s;ion, as a mere &s;cene for the exerci&s;e of the mind, and the engagements of the heart.
<Q>I will try and at|tempt every thing,</Q> &s;ays Brutus, <Q>I will never cea&s;e to recal my country from this &s;tate of &s;er|vility. If the event be favourable, it will prove matter of joy to us all; if not, yet I, notwith|&s;tanding, &s;hall rejoice.</Q>
Why rejoice in a di&s;|appointment? Why not be dejected, when his country was overwhelmed? Becau&s;e &s;orrow, per|haps, and dejection, can do no good. Nay, but they mu&s;t be endured when they come. And
<PB N="75" REF="82">
whence &s;hould they come to me? might the Ro|man &s;ay; I have followed my mind, and can fol|low it &s;till. Events may have changed the &s;itu|ation in which I am de&s;tined to act; but can they hinder my acting the part of a man? Shew me a &s;ituation in which a man can neither act nor die, and I will own he is wretched.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has the &s;orce of mind &s;teadily to view human life under this a&s;pect, has only to chu&s;e well his occupations, in order to command that &s;tate of enjoyment, and freedom of &s;oul, which probably con&s;titute the peculiar felicity to which his active nature is de&s;tined.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;itions of men, and con&s;equently their occupations, are commonly divided into two principal cla&s;&s;es; the &s;elfi&s;h, and the &s;ocial. The fir&s;t are indulged in &s;olitude; and if they carry a reference to mankind, it is that of emulation, competition, and enmity. The &s;econd incline us to live with our fellow-creatures, and to do them good; they tend to unite the members of &s;ociety together; they terminate in a mutual participa|tion of their cares and enjoyments, and render the pre&s;ence of men an occa&s;ion of joy. Under this cla&s;s may be enumerated the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;exes, the affections of parents and children, ge|neral humanity, or &s;ingular attachments; above all, that habit of the &s;oul by which we con&s;ider our&s;elves as but a part of &s;ome beloved commu|nity, and as but individual members of &s;ome &s;o|ciety, who&s;e general welfare is to us the &s;upreme object of zeal, and the great rule of our conduct. This affection is a principle of candour, which knows no partial di&s;tinctions, and is confined to no
<PB N="76" REF="83">
bounds: it may extend its effects beyond our per&s;onal acquaintance; it may, in the mind, and in thought, at lea&s;t, make us feel a relation to the univer&s;e, and to the whole creation of God.
<Q>Shall any one,</Q> &s;ays Antoninus, <Q>love the city of Cecrops, and you not love the city of God?</Q></P>
<P>NO emotion of the heart is indifferent. It is either an act of vivacity and joy, or a feeling of &s;adne&s;s; a tran&s;port of plea&s;ure, or a convul&s;ion of angui&s;h: and the exerci&s;es of our different di&s;po|&s;itions, as well as their gratifications, are likely to prove matter of the greate&s;t importance to our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery</P>
<P>THE individual is charged with the care of his animal pre&s;ervation. He may exi&s;t in &s;olitude, and, far removed from &s;ociety, perform many functions of &s;en&s;e, imagination, and rea&s;on. He is even rewarded for the proper di&s;charge of tho&s;e functions; and all the natural exerci&s;es which re|late to him&s;elf, as well as to his fellow-creatures, not only occupy without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing him, but in many in&s;tances are attended with po&s;itive plea&s;ures, and fill up the hours of life with agreeable occu|pation.</P>
<P>THERE is a degree, however, in which we &s;uppo&s;e that the care of our&s;elves becomes a &s;ource of painful anxiety and cruel pa&s;&s;ions; in which it degenerates into avarice, vanity, or pride; and in which, by fo&s;tering habits of jealou&s;y and envy, of fear and malice, it becomes as de&s;tructive of our own enjoyments, as it is ho&s;tile to the welfare of mankind. This evil, however, is not to be charged upon any exce&s;s in the care of our&s;elves,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
but upon a mere mi&s;take in the choice of our ob|jects. We look abroad for a happine&s;s which is to be found only in the qualities of the heart&punc; we think our&s;elves dependent on accidents; and are therefore kept in &s;u&s;pence and &s;olicitude: we think our&s;elves dependent on the will of other men; and are therefore &s;ervile and timid: we think our felicity is placed in &s;ubjects for which our fellow-creatures are rivals and competitors; and in pur&s;uit of hap|pine&s;s, we engage in tho&s;e &s;cenes of emulation, envy, hatred, animo&s;ity, and revenge, that lead to the highe&s;t pitch of di&s;tre&s;s. We act, in &s;hort, as if to pre&s;erve our&s;elves were to retain our weakne&s;s, and perpetuate our &s;ufferings. We charge the ills of a di&s;tempered imagination, and a corrupt heart, to the account of our fellow|creatures, to whom we refer the pangs of our di&s;|appointment or malice; and while we fo&s;ter our mi&s;ery, are &s;urpri&s;ed that the care of our&s;elves is attended with no better effects. But he who re|members that he is by nature a rational being, and a member of &s;ociety; that to pre&s;erve him|&s;elf, is to pre&s;erve his rea&s;on, and to pre&s;erve the be&s;t feelings of his heart; will encounter with none of the&s;e inconveniencies; and in the care of him&s;elf, will find &s;ubjects only of &s;atisfaction and triumph.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion of our appetites into benevolent and &s;elfi&s;h, has probably, in &s;ome degree, helped to mi&s;lead our apprehen&s;ion on the &s;ubject of per&s;onal enjoyment and private good; and our zeal to prove that virtue is di&s;intere&s;ted, has not greatly promoted its cau&s;e. The gratification of a &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire, it is thought, brings advantage or
<PB N="78" REF="85">
plea&s;ure to our&s;elves; that of benevolence termi|nates in the plea&s;ure or advantage of others: whereas, in reality, the gratification of every de|&s;ire is a per&s;onal enjoyment, and its value being proportioned to the particular quality or force of the &s;entiment, it may happen that the &s;ame per&s;on may reap a greater advantage from the good for|tune he has procured to another, than from that he has obtained for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHILE the gratifications of benevolence, therefore, are as much our own as tho&s;e of any other de&s;ire whatever, the mere exerci&s;es of this di&s;po&s;ition are, on many accounts, to be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t and the principal con&s;tituent of human happine&s;s. Every act of kindne&s;s, or of care, in the parent to his child; every emotion of the heart, in friend&s;hip or in love, in public zeal, or general humanity, are &s;o many acts of enjoyment and &s;atisfaction. Pity it&s;elf, and compa&s;&s;ion, even grief and melancholy, when grafted on &s;ome ten|der affection, partake of the nature of the &s;tock; and if they are not po&s;itive plea&s;ures, are at lea&s;t pains of a peculiar nature, which we do not even wi&s;h to exchange but for a very real enjoyment, obtained in relieving our object. Even extremes, in this cla&s;s of our di&s;po&s;itions, as they are the rever&s;e of hatred, envy, and malice, &s;o they are never attended with tho&s;e excruciating anxieties, jealou&s;ies, and fears, which tear the intere&s;ted mind; or if, in reality, any ill pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;e from a pretended attachment to our fellow-creatures, that attachment may be &s;afely condemned, as not genuine. If we be di&s;tru&s;tful or jealous, our pre|tended affection is probably no more than a de&s;ire
<PB N="79" REF="86">
of attention and per&s;onal con&s;ideration, a motive which frequently inclines us to be connected with our fellow-creatures; but to which we are as fre|quently willing to &s;acrifice their happine&s;s. We con&s;ider them as the tools of our vanity, plea&s;ure, or intere&s;t; not as the parties on whom we may be&s;tow the effects of our good-will, and our love.</P>
<P>A MIND devoted to this cla&s;s of its affections, being occupied with an object that may engage it habitually, is not reduced to court the amu&s;e|ments or plea&s;ures with which per&s;ons of an ill temper are obliged to repair their di&s;gu&s;ts: and temperance becomes an ea&s;y ta&s;k when gratifica|tions of &s;en&s;e are &s;upplanted by tho&s;e of the heart. Courage too is mo&s;t ea&s;ily a&s;&s;umed, or is rather in&s;eparable from that ardour of the mind, in &s;o|ciety, friend&s;hip, or in public action, which makes us forget &s;ubjects of per&s;onal anxiety or fear, and attend chiefly to the object of our zeal or affection, not to the trifling inconveniencies, dangers, or hard&s;hips, which we our&s;elves may encounter in &s;triving to maintain it.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem, therefore, to be the happine&s;s of man, to make his &s;ocial di&s;po&s;itions the ruling &s;pring of his occupations; to &s;tate him&s;elf as the member of a community, for who&s;e general good his heart may glow with an ardent zeal, to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e per&s;onal cares which are the foundation of painful anxieties, fear, jealou&s;y, and envy; or, as Mr. Pope expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame &s;entiment,</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87"><Q><L>Man, like the generous vine, &s;upported lives;</L><L>The &s;trength he gains, is from th'embrace he gives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame maxim will apply throughout every part of na|ture. <HI>To love, is to enjoy plea&s;ure: To bate, is to be in pain.</HI></NOTE>.</L> </Q></P>
<P>If this be the good of the individual, it is like|wi&s;e that of mankind; and virtue no longer im|po&s;es a ta&s;k by which we are obliged to be&s;tow upon others that good from which we our&s;elves re|frain; but &s;uppo&s;es, in the highe&s;t degree, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our&s;elves, that &s;tate of felicity which we are required to promote in the world.</P>
<P>WE commonly apprehend, that it is our duty to do kindne&s;&s;es, and our happine&s;s to receive them: but if, in reality, courage, and a heart de|voted to the good of mankind, are the con&s;tituents of human felicity, the kindne&s;s which is done in|fers a happine&s;s in the per&s;on from whom it pro|ceeds, not in him on whom it is be&s;towed; and the greate&s;t good which men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of forti|tude and genero&s;ity can procure to their fellow|creatures, is a participation of this happy charac|ter.

TO the benevolent, the &s;atisfaction of others is a ground of enjoyment; and exi&s;tence it&s;elf, in a world that is governed by the wi&s;dom of God, is a ble&s;&s;ing. The mind, freed from cares that lead to pu&s;illanimity and meanne&s;s, becomes calm, active, fearle&s;s, and bold; capable of every enter|pri&s;e, and vigorous in the exerci&s;e of every ta|lent, by which the nature of man is adorned. On this foundation was rai&s;ed the admirable character, which, during a certain period of their &s;tory, di|&s;tingui&s;hed the celebrated nations of antiquity, and rendered familiar and ordinary in their manners, examples of magnanimity, which, under govern|ments le&s;s favourable to the public affections, rarely occur; or which, without being much prac|ti&s;ed, or even under&s;tood, are made &s;ubjects of admiration and &s;welling panegyric.
<Q>Thus,</Q> &s;ays Xenophon, <Q>died Thra&s;ybulus; who indeed ap|pears to have been a good man.</Q>
What valu|able prai&s;e, and how &s;ignificant to tho&s;e who know the &s;tory of this admirable per&s;on! The members of tho&s;e illu&s;trious &s;tates, from the habit of con&s;i|dering them&s;elves as part of a community, or at lea&s;t as deeply involved with &s;ome order of men in the &s;tate, were regardle&s;s of per&s;onal con&s;idera|tions: they had a perpetual view to objects which excite a great ardour in the &s;oul; which led them to act perpetually in the view of their fellow|citizens, and to practi&s;e tho&s;e arts of deliberation, elocution, policy, and war, on which the fortunes of nations, or of men, in their collective body, depend. To the force of mind collected in this career, and to the improvements of wit which were made in pur&s;uing it, the&s;e nations owed, not only their magnanimity, and the &s;uperiority of
<PB N="82" REF="89">
their political and military conduct, but even the arts of poetry and literature, which among them were only the inferior appendages of a genius otherwi&s;e excited, cultivated, and refined.</P>
<P>TO the ancient Greek, or the Roman, the in|dividual was nothing, and the public every thing. To the modern, in too many nations of Europe, the individual is every thing, and the public no|thing. The &s;tate is merely a combination of de|partments, in which con&s;ideration, wealth, emi|nence, or power, are offered as the reward of &s;ervice. It was the nature of modern government, even in its fir&s;t in&s;titution, to be&s;tow on every individual a fixed &s;tation and dignity, which he was to maintain for him&s;elf. Our ance&s;tors, in rude ages, during the rece&s;s of wars from abroad, fought for their per&s;onal claims at home, and by their competitions, and the balance of their powers, maintained a kind of political freedom in the &s;tate, while private parties were &s;ubject to conti|nual wrongs and oppre&s;&s;ions. Their po&s;terity, in times more poli&s;hed, have repre&s;&s;ed the civil di&s;|orders in which the activity of earlier ages chiefly con&s;i&s;ted; but they employ the calm they have gained, not in fo&s;tering a zeal for tho&s;e laws, and that con&s;titution of government, to which they owe their protection, but in practi&s;ing apart, and each for him&s;elf, the &s;everal arts of per&s;onal ad|vancement, or profit, which their political e&s;ta|bli&s;hments may enable them to pur&s;ue with &s;uc|ce&s;s. Commerce, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to com|prehend every lucatrive art, is accordingly con|&s;idered as the great object of nations, and the principal &s;tudy of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">
SO much are we accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider per|&s;onal fortune as the &s;ole object of care, that even under popular e&s;tabli&s;hments, and in &s;tates where different orders of men are &s;ummoned to partake in the government of their country, and where the liberties they enjoy cannot be long pre&s;erved, without vigilance and activity on the part of the &s;ubject; &s;till they, who, in the vulgar phra&s;e, have not their fortunes to make, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be at a lo&s;s for occupation, and betake them&s;elves to &s;olitary pa&s;times, or cultivate what they are plea&s;ed to call a ta&s;te for gardening, building, drawing, or mu&s;ic. With this aid, they endea|vour to fill up the blanks of a li&s;tle&s;s life, and avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of curing their languors by any po&s;itive &s;ervice to their country, or to man|kind.</P>
<P>THE weak or the malicious are well employed in any thing that is innocent, and are fortunate in finding any occupation which prevents the effects of a temper that would prey upon them&s;elves, or upon their fellow-creatures. But they who are ble&s;&s;ed with a happy di&s;po&s;ition, with capacity and vigour, incur a real debauchery, by having any amu&s;ement that occupies an improper &s;hare of their time; and are really cheated of their hap|pine&s;s, in being made to believe, that any occu|pation or pa&s;time is better fitted to amu&s;e them|&s;elves, than that which at the &s;ame time produces &s;ome real good to their fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ort of entertainment, indeed, cannot be the choice of the mercenary, the envious, or

the malignant. Its value is known only to per|&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite temper; and to their expe|rience alone we appeal. Guided by mere di&s;po|&s;ition, and without the aid of reflection, in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in friend&s;hip, and in public life, they often acquit them&s;elves well; and borne with &s;atisfac|tion on the tide of their emotions and &s;entiments, enjoy the pre&s;ent hour, without recollection of the pa&s;t, or hopes of the future. It is in &s;peculation, not in practice, they are made to di&s;cover, that virtue is a ta&s;k of &s;everity and &s;elf-denial.</P>

<P>MAN is, by nature, the member of a com|munity; and when con&s;idered in this ca|pacity, the individual appears to be no longer made for him&s;elf. He mu&s;t forego his happine&s;s and his freedom, where the&s;e interfere with the good of &s;ociety. He is only part of a whole; and the prai&s;e we think due to his virtue, is but a branch of that more general commendation we be&s;tow on the member of a body, on the part of a fabric or engine, for being well fitted to occupy its place, and to produce its effect.</P>
<P>IF this follow from the relation of a part to its whole, and if the public good be the principal ob|ject with individuals, it is likewi&s;e true, that the happine&s;s of individuals is the great end of civil &s;ociety: for in what &s;en&s;e can a public enjoy any good, if its members, con&s;idered apart, be un|happy?</P>
<P>THE intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, however, and of its members, are ea&s;ily reconciled. If the individual owe every degree of con&s;ideration to the public, he receives, in paying that very con&s;ideration, the greate&s;t happine&s;s of which his nature is capa|ble; and the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that the public can be&s;tow on its members, is to keep them attached to it&s;elf. That is the mo&s;t happy &s;tate, which is mo&s;t beloved by its &s;ubjects; and they are the mo&s;t happy men, who&s;e hearts are engaged to a
<PB N="86" REF="93">
community, in which they find every object of genero&s;ity and zeal, and a &s;cope to the exerci&s;e of every talent, and of every virtuous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>AFTER we have thus found general maxims, the greater part of our trouble remains, their ju&s;t application to particular ca&s;es. Nations are diffe|rent in re&s;pect to their extent, numbers of peo|ple, and wealth; in re&s;pect to the arts they prac|ti&s;e, and the accommodations they have procured. The&s;e circum&s;tances may not only affect the man|ners of men; they even, in our e&s;teem, come into competition with the article of manners it&s;elf; are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute a national felicity, in|dependent of virtue; and give a title, upon which we indulge our own vanity, and that of other nations, as we do that of private men, on the &s;core of their fortunes and honours.</P>
<P>BUT if this way of mea&s;uring happine&s;s, when applied to private men, be ruinous and fal&s;e, it is &s;o no le&s;s when applied to nations. Wealth, commerce, extent of territory, and the knowledge of arts, are, when properly employed, the means of pre&s;ervation, and the foundations of power. If they fail in part, the nation is weakened; if they were entirely with-held, the race would peri&s;h: their tendency is to maintain numbers of men, but not to con&s;titute happine&s;s. They will accord|ingly maintain the wretched, as well as the happy. They an&s;wer one purpo&s;e, but are not therefore &s;ufficient for all; and are of little &s;ignificance, when only employed to maintain a timid, dejected, and &s;ervile people.</P>

GREAT and powerful &s;tates are able to over|come and &s;ubdue the weak; poli&s;hed and com|mercial nations have more wealth, and practi&s;e a greater variety of arts, than the rude: but the happine&s;s of men, in all ca&s;es alike, con&s;i&s;ts in the ble&s;&s;ings of a candid, an active, and &s;trenuous mind. And if we con&s;ider the &s;tate of &s;ociety merely as that into which mankind are led by their propen&s;ities, as a &s;tate to be valued from its effect in pre&s;erving the &s;pecies, in ripening their talents, and exciting their virtues, we need not enlarge our communities, in order to enjoy the&s;e advantages. We frequently obtain them in the mo&s;t remarkable degree, where nations remain in|dependent, and are of a &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>TO increa&s;e the numbers of mankind, may be admitted as a great and important object; but to extend the limits of any particular &s;tate, is not, perhaps, the way to obtain it; while we de&s;ire that our fellow-creatures &s;hould multiply, it does not follow, that the whole &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be united under one head. We are apt to admire the empire of the Romans, as a model of national greatne&s;s and &s;plendour: but the greatne&s;s we ad|mire in this ca&s;e, was ruinous to the virtue and the happine&s;s of mankind; it was found to be incon|&s;i&s;tent with all the advantages which that con|quering people had formerly enjoyed in the arti|cles of government and manners.</P>
<P>THE emulation of nations proceeds from their divi&s;ion. A clu&s;ter of &s;tates, like a company of men, find the exerci&s;e of their rea&s;on, and the te&s;t of their virtues, in the affairs they tran&s;act, upon
<PB N="88" REF="95">
a foot of equality, and of &s;eparate intere&s;t. The mea&s;ures taken for &s;afety, including great part of the national policy, are relative in every &s;tate to what is apprehended from abroad. Athens was nece&s;&s;ary to Sparta, in the exerci&s;e of her virtue, as &s;teel is to flint in the production of fire; and if the cities of Greece had been united under one head, we &s;hould never have heard of Epaminon|das or Thra&s;ybulus, of Lycurgus or Solon.</P>
<P>WHEN we rea&s;on in behalf of our &s;pecies, therefore, although we may lament the abu&s;es which &s;ometimes ari&s;e from independence, and op|po&s;ition of intere&s;t; yet, whil&s;t any degrees of virtue remain with mankind, we cannot wi&s;h to croud, under one e&s;tabli&s;hment, numbers of men who may &s;erve to con&s;titute &s;everal; or to com|mit affairs to the conduct of one &s;enate, one legi|&s;lative or executive power, which, upon a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate footing, might furni&s;h an exerci&s;e of ability, and a theatre of glory, to many.</P>
<P>THIS may be a &s;ubject upon which no deter|minate rule can be given, but the admiration of boundle&s;s dominion is a ruinous error; and in no in&s;tance, perhaps, is the real intere&s;t of mankind more entirely mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ure of enlargement to be wi&s;hed for any particular &s;tate, is often to be taken from the condition of its neighbours. Where a number of &s;tates are contiguous, they &s;hould be near an e|quality, in order that they may be mutually ob|jects of re&s;pect and con&s;ideration, and in order that they may po&s;&s;e&s;s that independence in which the political life of a nation con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="96">
WHEN the kingdoms of Spain were united, when the great fiefs in France were annexed to the crown, it was no longer expedient for the na|tions of Great Britain to continue disjoined.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall republics of Greece, indeed, by their &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and the balance of their power, found almo&s;t in every village the object of nations. Every little di&s;trict was a nur&s;ery of ex|cellent men, and what is now the wretched corner of a great empire, was the field on which man|kind have reaped their principal honours. But in modern Europe, republics of a &s;imilar extent, are like &s;hrubs, under the &s;hade of a taller wood, choked by the neighbourhood of more powerful &s;tates. In their ca&s;e, a certain di&s;proportion of force fru&s;trates, in a great mea&s;ure, the advantage of &s;eparation. They are like the trader in Poland, who is the more de&s;picable, and the le&s;s &s;ecure, that he is neither ma&s;ter nor &s;lave.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENT communities, in the mean time, however weak, are aver&s;e to a coalition, not only where it comes with an air of impo&s;ition, or un|equal treaty, but even where it implies no more than the admi&s;&s;ion of new members to an equal &s;hare of con&s;ideration with the old. The citizen has no intere&s;t in the annexation of kingdoms; he mu&s;t find his importance dimini&s;hed, as the &s;tate is enlarged: but ambitious men, under the enlargement of territory, find a more plentiful harve&s;t of power, and of wealth, while govern|ment it&s;elf is an ea&s;ier ta&s;k. Hence the ruinous progre&s;s of empire; and hence free nations, under the &s;hew of acquiring dominion, &s;uffer them&s;elves,
<PB N="90" REF="97">
in the end, to be yoked with the &s;laves they had conquered.</P>
<P>OUR de&s;ire to augment the force of a nation is the only pretext for enlarging its territory; but this mea&s;ure, when pur&s;ued to extremes, &s;eldom fails to fru&s;trate it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the advantage of num|bers, and &s;uperior re&s;ources in war, the &s;trength of a nation is derived from the character, not from the wealth, nor from the multitude of its people. If the trea&s;ure of a &s;tate can hire num|bers of men, erect ramparts, and furni&s;h the im|plements of war; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the fearful are ea&s;ily &s;eized; a timorous multitude falls into rout of it&s;elf; ramparts may be &s;caled where they are not de&s;ended by valour; and arms are of con|&s;equence only in the hands of the brave. The band to which Age&s;ilaus pointed as the wall of his city, made a defence for their country more per|manent, and more effectual, than the rock and the cement with which other cities were fortified.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould owe little to that &s;tate&s;man who were to contrive a defence that might &s;uper&s;ede the external u&s;es of virtue. It is wi&s;ely ordered for man, as a rational being, that the employ|ment of rea&s;on is nece&s;&s;ary to his pre&s;ervation: it is fortunate for him, in the pur&s;uit of di&s;tinction, that his per&s;onal con&s;ideration depends on his cha|racter; and it is fortunate for nations, that, in order to be powerful and &s;afe, they mu&s;t &s;trive to maintain the courage, and cultivate the virtues, of their people. By the u&s;e of &s;uch means, they at once gain their external ends, and are happy.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98">
PEACE and unanimity are commonly con&s;idered as the principal foundations of public felicity; yet the rival&s;hip of &s;eparate communities, and the agitations of a free people, are the principles of political life, and the &s;chool of men. How &s;hall we reconcile the&s;e jarring and oppo&s;ite tenets? It is, perhaps, not nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile them. The pacific may do what they can to allay the animo&s;ities, and to reconcile the opinions, of men; and it will be happy if they can &s;ucceed in re|pre&s;&s;ing their crimes, and in calming the wor&s;t of their pa&s;&s;ions. Nothing, in the mean time, but cor|ruption or &s;lavery can &s;uppre&s;s the debates that &s;ub&s;i&s;t among men of integrity, who bear an equal part in the admini&s;tration of &s;tate.</P>
<P>A PERFECT agreement in matters of opinion is not to be obtained in the mo&s;t &s;elect company; and if it were, what would become of &s;ociety?
<Q>The Spartan legi&s;lator,</Q> &s;ays Plutarch, <Q>appears to have &s;own the &s;eeds of variance and di&s;&s;en|&s;ion among his countrymen: he meant that good citizens &s;hould be led to di&s;pute; he con|&s;idered emulation as the brand by which their virtues were kindled; and &s;eemed to appre|hend, that a complai&s;ance, by which men &s;ub|mit their opinions without examination, is a principal &s;ource of corruption.</Q></P>
<P>FORMS of government are &s;uppo&s;ed to decide the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of mankind. But forms of government mu&s;t be varied, in order to &s;uit the extent, the way of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the character, and the manners of different nations. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the multitude may be &s;uffered to govern
<PB N="92" REF="99">
them&s;elves; in others, they mu&s;t be &s;everely re|&s;trained. The inhabitants of a village in &s;ome primitive age, may have been &s;afely intru&s;ted to the conduct of rea&s;on, and to the &s;ugge&s;tion of their innocent views; but the tenants of Newgate can &s;carcely be tru&s;ted, with chains locked to their bodies, and bars of iron fixed to their legs. How is it po&s;&s;ible, therefore, to find any &s;ingle form of government that would &s;uit mankind in every condition?</P>
<P>WE proceed, however, in the following &s;ec|tion, to point out the di&s;tinctions, and to explain the language which occurs in this place, on the head of different models for &s;ubordination and go|vernment.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The &s;ame &s;ubject continued.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a common ob&s;ervation, That mankind were originally equal. They have indeed by nature equal rights to their pre&s;ervation, and to the u&s;e of their talents; but they are fitted for differ|ent &s;tations; and when they are cla&s;&s;ed by a rule taken from this circum&s;tance, they &s;uffer no in|ju&s;tice on the &s;ide of their natural rights. It is obvious, that &s;ome mode of &s;ubordination is as nece&s;&s;ary to men as &s;ociety it&s;elf; and this, not only to attain the ends of government, but to com|ply with an order e&s;tabli&s;hed by nature.</P>
<P>PRIOR to any political in&s;titution whatever, men are qualified by a great diver&s;ity of talents, by a different tone of the &s;oul, and ardour of the pa&s;|&s;ions, to act a variety of parts. Bring them to|gether, each will find his place. They cen&s;ure or applaud in a body; they con&s;ult and deliberate in more &s;elect parties; they take or give an a&s;cendant as individuals; and numbers are by this means fitted to act in company, and to pre&s;erve their communities, before any formal di&s;tribution of of|fice is made.</P>
<P>WE are formed to act in this manner; and if we have any doubts with relation to the rights of government in general, we owe our perplexity more to the &s;ubtilties of the &s;peculative, than to any uncertainty in the feelings of the heart. Involved
<PB N="94" REF="101">
in the re&s;olutions of our company, we move with the croud before we have determined the rule by which its will is collected. We follow a leader, before we have &s;ettled the ground of his preten|&s;ions, or adju&s;ted the form of his election: and it is not till after mankind have committed many errors in the capacities of magi&s;trate and &s;ubject, that they think of making government it&s;elf a &s;ub|ject of rules.</P>
<P>IF therefore, in con&s;idering the variety of forms under which &s;ocieties &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the ca&s;ui&s;t is plea&s;ed to inquire, What title one man, or any number of men, have to controul his actions? he may be an|&s;wered, None at all, provided that his actions have no effect to the prejudice of his fellow-creatures; but if they have, the rights of defence, and the obligation to repre&s;s the commi&s;&s;ion of wrongs, be|long to collective bodies, as well as to individuals. Many rude nations, having no formal tribunals for the judgement of crimes, a&s;&s;emble, when alarmed by any flagrant offence, and take their mea&s;ures with the criminal as they would with an enemy.</P>
<P>BUT will this con&s;ideration, which confirms the title to &s;overeignty, where it is exerci&s;ed by the &s;ociety in its collective capacity, or by tho&s;e to whom the powers of the whole are committed, like|wi&s;e &s;upport the claim to dominion, where-ever it is ca&s;ually lodged, or even where it is only main|tained by force?</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion may be &s;ufficiently an&s;wered, by ob&s;erving, that a right to do ju&s;tice, and to do good, is competent to every individual, or order of men; and that the exerci&s;e of this right has no
<PB N="95" REF="102">
limits but in the defect of power. But a right to do wrong, and commit inju&s;tice, is an abu&s;e of language, and a contradiction in terms. It is no more competent to the collective body of a people, than it is to any &s;ingle u&s;urper. When we admit &s;uch a prerogative in the ca&s;e of any &s;overeign, we can only mean to expre&s;s the extent of his pow|er, and the force with which he is enabled to ex|ecute his plea&s;ure. Such a prerogative is a&s;&s;umed by the leader of banditti at the head of his gang, or by a de&s;potic prince at the head of his troops. When the &s;word is pre&s;ented by either, the tra|veller or the inhabitant may &s;ubmit from a &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity or fear; but he lies under no obligati|on from a motive of duty or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE multiplicity of forms, in the mean time, which different &s;ocieties offer to our view, is al|mo&s;t infinite. The cla&s;&s;es into which they di&s;tri|bute their members, the manner in which they e&s;tabli&s;h the legi&s;lative and executive powers, the imperceptible circum&s;tances by which they are led to have different cu&s;toms, and to confer on their governors unequal mea&s;ures of power and autho|rity, give ri&s;e to perpetual di&s;tinctions between con&s;titutions the mo&s;t nearly re&s;embling one ano|ther, and give to human affairs a variety in de|tail, which, in its full extent, no under&s;tanding can comprehend, and no memory retain.</P>
<P>IN order to have a general and comprehen&s;ive knowledge of the whole, we mu&s;t be determined on this, as on every other &s;ubject, to overlook many particulars and &s;ingularities, di&s;tingui&s;hing differ|ent governments; to fix our attention on certain points, in which many agree; and thereby e&s;tab|li&s;h
<PB N="96" REF="103">
a few general heads, under which the &s;ub|ject may be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered. When we have marked the characteri&s;tics which form the general points of coincidence; when we have pur&s;ued them to their con&s;equences in the &s;everal modes of le|gi&s;lation, execution, and judicature, in the e&s;tab|li&s;hments which relate to police, commerce, reli|gion, or dome&s;tic life; we have made an acqui|&s;ition of knowledge, which, though it does not &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of experience, may &s;erve to direct our inquiries, and, in the mid&s;t of affairs, to give an order and a method for the arrangement of particulars that occur to our ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>WHEN I recollect what the Pre&s;ident Monte&s;|quieu has written, I am at a lo&s;s to tell, why I &s;hould treat of human affairs: but I too am in&s;ti|gated by my reflections, and my &s;entiments; and I may utter them more to the comprehen&s;ion of ordinary capacities, becau&s;e I am more on the level of ordinary men. If it be nece&s;&s;ary to pave the way for what follows on the general hi&s;tory of nations, by giving &s;ome account of the heads un|der which various forms of government may be conveniently ranged, the reader &s;hould perhaps be referred to what has been already delivered on the &s;ubject by this profound politician and amiable morali&s;t. In his writings will be found, not only the original of what I am now, for the fake of or|der, to copy from him, but likewi&s;e probably the &s;ource of many ob&s;ervations, which, in different places, I may under the belief of invention, have repeated, without quoting their author.</P>
<P>THE ancient philo&s;ophers treated of govern|ment commonly under three heads; the Demo|ratic,
<PB N="97" REF="104">
the Ari&s;tocratic, and the De&s;potic. Their attention was chiefly occupied with the varieties of republican government; and they paid little re|gard to a very important di&s;tinction, which Mr. Monte&s;quieu has made, between de&s;poti&s;m and mo|narchy. He too has con&s;idered government as re|ducible to three general forms; and,
<Q>to under|&s;tand the nature of each,</Q> he ob&s;erves, <Q>it is &s;ufficient to recal ideas which are familiar with men of the lea&s;t reflection, who admit three de|finitions, or rather three facts: That a republic is a &s;tate in which the people in a collective bo|dy, or a part of the people, po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;overeign power: That monarchy is that in which one man governs according to fixed and determinate laws: and a de&s;poti&s;m is that in which one man, without law, or rule of admini&s;tration, by the mere impul&s;e of will or caprice, decides, and carries every thing before him.</Q></P>
<P>REPUBLICS admit of a very material di|&s;tinction, which is pointed out in the general defi|nition; that between democracy and ari&s;tocracy. In the fir&s;t, &s;upreme power remains in the hands of the collective body. Every office of magi&s;tra|cy, at the nomination of this &s;overeign, is open to every citizen; who, in the di&s;charge of his duty, becomes the mini&s;ter of the people, and account|able to them for every object of his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd, the &s;overeignty is lodged in a par|ticular cla&s;s, or order of men; who, being once named, continue for life; or by the hereditary di|&s;tinctions of birth and fortune, are advanced to a &s;tation of permanent &s;uperiority. From this or|der, and by their nomination, all the offices of magi&s;tracy are filled; and in the different a&s;&s;em|blies
<PB N="98" REF="105">
which they con&s;titute, whatever relates to the legi&s;lation, the execution, or juri&s;diction, is finally determined.</P>
<P>MR. Monte&s;quieu has pointed out the &s;entiments or maxims from which men mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to act under the&s;e different governments.</P>
<P>IN democracy, they mu&s;t love equality; they mu&s;t re&s;pect the rights of their fellow-citizens; they mu&s;t unite by the common ties of affection to the &s;tate. In forming per&s;onal preten&s;ions, they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with that degree of con&s;ideration they can procure by their abilities fairly mea&s;ured with tho&s;e of an opponent; they mu&s;t labour for the public without hope of profit; they mu&s;t re|ject every attempt to create a per&s;onal depend|ence. Candour, force, and elevation of mind, in &s;hort, are the props of democracy; and virtue is the principle of conduct required to its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>HOW beautiful a pre-eminence on the &s;ide of popular government! and how ardently &s;hould man|kind wi&s;h for the form, if it tended to e&s;tabli&s;h the principle, or were, in every in&s;tance, a &s;ure indication of its pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>BUT perhaps we mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the prin|ciple, in order, with any hopes of advantage, to receive the form; and where the fir&s;t is entirely extingui&s;hed, the other may be fraught with evil, if any additional evil de&s;erves to be &s;hunned where men are already unhappy.</P>
<P>AT Con&s;tantinople or Algiers, it is a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle when men pretend to act on a foot of equality: they only mean to &s;hake off the re|&s;traints
<PB N="99" REF="106">
of government, and to &s;eize as much as they can of that &s;poil, which, in ordinary times, is ingro&s;&s;ed by the ma&s;ter they &s;erve.</P>
<P>IT is one advantage of democracy, that the prin|cipal ground of di&s;tinction being per&s;onal quali|ties, men are cla&s;&s;ed according to their abilities, and to the merit of their actions. Though all have equal preten&s;ions to power, yet the &s;tate is actually governed by a few. The majority of the people, even in their capacity of &s;overeign, only pretend to employ their &s;en&s;es; to feel, when pre&s;&s;ed by national inconveniencies, or threatened by public dangers; and with the ardour which is apt to ari&s;e in crouded a&s;&s;emblies, to urge the pur&s;uits in which they are engaged, or to repel the attacks with which they are menaced.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t perfect equality of rights can never exclude the a&s;cendant of &s;uperior minds, nor the a&s;&s;emblies of a collective body govern without the direction of &s;elect councils. On this account, po|pular government may be confounded with ari&s;to|cracy. But this alone does not con&s;titute the cha|racter of ari&s;tocratical government. Here the mem|bers of the &s;tate are divided, at lea&s;t, into two cla&s;&s;es; of which one is de&s;tined to command, the other to obey. No merits or defects can rai&s;e or &s;ink a per&s;on from one cla&s;s to the other. The only effect of per&s;onal character is, to procure the individual a &s;uitable degree of con&s;ideration with his own order, not to vary his rank. In one &s;itu|ation he is taught to a&s;&s;ume, in another to yield the pre-eminence. He occupies the &s;tation of pa|tron or client, and is either the &s;overeign or the &s;ubject of his country. The whole citizens may
<PB N="100" REF="107">
unite in executing the plans of &s;tate, but never in deliberating on its mea&s;ures, or enacting its laws. What belongs to the whole people under demo|cracy, is here confined to a part. Members of the &s;uperior order, are among them&s;elves, po&s;&s;ibly, cla&s;&s;ed according to their abilities, but retain a perpetual a&s;cendant over tho&s;e of inferior &s;tation. They are at once the &s;ervants and the ma&s;ters of the &s;tate, and pay with their per&s;onal attendance and their blood for the civil or military honours they enjoy.</P>
<P>TO maintain for him&s;elf, and to admit in his fel|low-citizen, a perfect equality of privilege and &s;ta|tion, is no longer the leading maxim of the mem|ber of &s;uch a community. The rights of men are modified by their condition. One order claims more than it is willing to yield; the other mu&s;t be ready to yield what it does not a&s;&s;ume to it&s;elf: and it is with good rea&s;on that Mr. Monte&s;quieu gives to the principle of &s;uch governments the name of <HI>moderation,</HI> not of <HI>virtue.</HI></P>
<P>THE elevation of one cla&s;s is a moderated ar|rogance; the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the other a limited de|ference. The fir&s;t mu&s;t be careful, by concealing the invidious part of their di&s;tinction, to palliate what is grievous in the public arrangement, and by their education, their cultivated manners, and im|proved talents, to appear qualified for the &s;tations they occupy. The other mu&s;t be taught to yield, from re&s;pect and per&s;onal attachment, what could not otherwi&s;e be extorted by force. When this moderation fails on either &s;ide, the con&s;titution totters. A populace enraged to mutiny, may claim the right of equality to which they are admitted
<PB N="101" REF="108">
in democratical &s;tates; or a nobility bent on do|minion, may chu&s;e among them&s;elves, or find al|ready pointed out to them, a &s;overeign, who, by advantages of &s;ortune, popularity, or abilities, is ready to &s;eize for his own family, that envied pow|er, which has already carried his order beyond the limits of moderation, and infected particular men with a boundle&s;s ambition.</P>
<P>MONARCHIES have accordingly been found with the recent marks of ari&s;tocracy. There, how|ever, the monarch is only the fir&s;t among the nobles; he mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with a limited power; his &s;ubjects are ranged into cla&s;&s;es; he finds on every quarter a pretence to privilege, that circum&s;cribes his authority; and he finds a force &s;ufficient to con|fine his admini&s;tration within certain bounds of equity, and determinate laws.</P>
<P>UNDER &s;uch governments, however, the love of equality is prepo&s;terous, and moderation it&s;elf is unnece&s;&s;ary. The object of every rank is pre|cedency, and every order may di&s;play its advan|tages to their full extent. The &s;overeign him&s;elf owes great part of his authority to the &s;ounding titles and the dazzling equipage which he exhibits in public. The &s;ubordinate ranks lay claim to im|portance by a like exhibition, and for that purpo&s;e carry in every in&s;tant the en&s;igns of their birth, or the ornaments of their fortune. What el&s;e could mark out to the individual the relation in which he &s;tands to his fellow-&s;ubjects, or di&s;tingui&s;h the numberle&s;s ranks that fill up the interval between the &s;tate of the &s;overeign and that of the pea&s;ant? Or what el&s;e could, in &s;tates of a great extent, pre|&s;erve any appearance of order, among members di&s;united by ambition and intere&s;t, and de&s;tined
<PB N="102" REF="109">
to form a community, without the &s;en&s;e of any common concern?</P>
<P>MONARCHIES are generally found, where the &s;tate is enlarged in population and in territory, be|yond the numbers and dimen&s;ions that are con|&s;i&s;tent with republican government. Together with the&s;e circum&s;tances, great inequalities ari&s;e in the di&s;tribution of property; and the de&s;ire of pre|eminence becomes the predominant pa&s;&s;ion. Every rank would exerci&s;e its prerogative, and the &s;ove|reign is perpetually tempted to enlarge his own; if &s;ubjects, who de&s;pair of precedence, plead for equality, he is willing to favour their claims, and to aid them in procuring what mu&s;t weaken a force with which he him&s;elf is, on many occa&s;ions, ob|liged to contend. In the event of &s;uch a policy, many invidious di&s;tinctions and grievances peculiar to monarchical government, may, in appearance, be removed; but the &s;tate of equality to which the &s;ubjects approach, is that of &s;laves, equally dependent on the will of a ma&s;ter, not that of free|men in a condition to maintain their own.</P>
<P>THE principle of monarchy, according to Mon|te&s;quieu, is honour. Men may po&s;&s;e&s;s good qua|lities, elevation of mind, and fortitude; but the &s;en&s;e of equality, that will bear no incroachment on the per&s;onal rights of the meane&s;t citizen; the indignant &s;pirit, that will not court a protection, nor accept as a favour, what is due as a right; the public affection, which is founded on the neglect of per&s;onal con&s;iderations, are neither con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ervation of the con&s;titution, nor agree|able to the habits acquired in any &s;tation a&s;&s;igned to its members.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="110">
EVERY condition is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of peculiar dig|nity, and points out a propriety of conduct, which men of &s;tation are obliged to maintain. In the com|merce of &s;uperiors and inferiors, it is the object of ambition, and of vanity, to refine on the advan|tages of rank; while, to facilitate the intercour&s;e of polite &s;ociety, it is the aim of good breeding, to di&s;gui&s;e or reject them.</P>
<P>THOUGH the objects of con&s;ideration are rather the dignities of &s;tation than per&s;onal qualities; though friend&s;hip cannot be formed by mere in|clination, nor alliances by the mere choice of the heart; yet men &s;o united, and even without chang|ing their order, are highly &s;u&s;ceptible of moral ex|cellence, or liable to many different degrees of cor|ruption. They may act a vigorous part as mem|bers of the &s;tate, an amiable one in the commerce of private &s;ociety; or they may yield up their dig|nity as citizens, even while they rai&s;e their arro|gance and pre&s;umption as private parties.</P>
<P>IN monarchy, all orders of men derive their ho|nours from the crown; but they continue to hold them as a right, and they exerci&s;e a &s;ubordinate power in the &s;tate, founded on the permanent rank they enjoy, and on the attachment of tho&s;e whom they are appointed to lead and protect. Though they do not force them&s;elves into national councils, and public a&s;&s;emblies, and though the name of &s;enate is unknown; yet the &s;entiments they adopt mu&s;t have weight with the &s;overeign; and every indi|vidual, in his &s;eparate capacity, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, deliberates for his country. In whatever does not derogate from his rank, he has an arm ready to &s;erve the community; in whatever alarms his &s;en&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="111">
of honour, he has aver&s;ions and di&s;likes, which a|mount to a negative on the will of his prince.</P>
<P>INTANGLED together by the reciprocal ties of dependence and protection, though not combined by the &s;en&s;e of a common intere&s;t, the &s;ubjects of monarchy, like tho&s;e of republics, find them&s;elves occupied as the members of an active &s;ociety, and engaged to treat with their fellow-creatures on a liberal footing. If tho&s;e principles of honour which &s;ave the individual from &s;ervility in his own per&s;on, or from becoming an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion in the hands of another, &s;hould fail; if they &s;hould give way to the maxims of commerce, to the refine|ments of a &s;uppo&s;ed philo&s;ophy, or to the mi&s;placed ardours of a republican &s;pirit; if they are betrayed by the cowardice of &s;ubjects, or &s;ubdued by the ambition of princes; what mu&s;t become of the na|tions of Europe?</P>
<P>DESPOTISM is monarchy corrupted, in which a court and a prince in appearance remain, but in which every &s;ubordinate rank is de&s;troyed; in which the &s;ubject is told, that he has no rights; that he cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s any property, nor fill any &s;tation, independent of the momentary will of his prince. The&s;e doctrines are founded on the maxims of con|que&s;t; they mu&s;t be inculcated with the whip and the &s;word; and are be&s;t received under the terror of chains and impri&s;onment. Fear, therefore, is the principle which qualifies the &s;ubject to oc|cupy his &s;tation: and the &s;overeign, who holds out the en&s;igns of terror &s;o freely to others, has abun|dant rea&s;on to give this pa&s;&s;ion a principal place with him&s;elf. That tenure which he has devi&s;ed for the rights of others, is &s;oon applied to his own; and from his eager de&s;ire to &s;ecure, or to extend,
<PB N="105" REF="112">
his power, he finds it become, like the fortunes of his people, a creature of mere imagination and un&s;ettled caprice.</P>
<P>WHILST we thus, with &s;o much accuracy, can a&s;&s;ign the ideal limits that may di&s;tingui&s;h con|&s;titutions of government, we find them, in reality, both in re&s;pect to the principle and the form, variou&s;ly blended together. In what &s;ociety are not men cla&s;&s;ed by external di&s;tinctions, as well as per&s;onal qualities? In what &s;tate are they not actuated by a variety of principles; ju&s;tice, ho|nour, moderation, and fear? It is the purpo&s;e of &s;cience, not to di&s;gui&s;e this confu&s;ion in its object, but, in the multiplicity and combination of par|ticulars, to find the principal points which de&s;erve our attention, and which, being well under&s;tood, &s;ave us from the embarra&s;&s;ment which the varieties of &s;ingular ca&s;es might otherwi&s;e create. In the &s;ame degree in which governments require men to act from principles of virtue, of honour, or of fear, they are more or le&s;s fully compri&s;ed under the heads of republic, monarchy, or de&s;poti&s;m, and the general theory is more or le&s;s applicable to their particular ca&s;e.</P>
<P>FORMS of government, in fact, mutually ap|proach or recede by many, and often in&s;en&s;ible gradations. Democracy, by admitting certain in|equalities of rank, approaches to ari&s;tocracy. In popular, as well as ari&s;tocratical governments, par|ticular men, by their per&s;onal authority, and &s;ome|times by the credit of their family, have main|tained a &s;pecies of monarchical power. The monarch is limited in different degrees: even the de&s;potic prince is only that monarch who&s;e &s;ubjects
<PB N="106" REF="113">
claim the fewe&s;t privileges, or who is him&s;elf be&s;t prepared to &s;ubdue them by force. All the&s;e va|rieties are but &s;teps in the hi&s;tory of mankind, and mark the fleeting and tran&s;ient &s;ituations through which they have pa&s;&s;ed, while &s;upported by vir|tue, or depre&s;&s;ed by vice.</P>
<P>PERFECT democracy and de&s;poti&s;m appear to be the oppo&s;ite extremes to which con&s;titutions of government are &s;ometimes carried. Under the fir&s;t, a perfect virtue is required; under the &s;e|cond, a total corruption is &s;uppo&s;ed: yet in point of mere form, there being nothing fixed in the ranks and di&s;tinctions of men, beyond the ca&s;ual and temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, &s;ocieties ea&s;ily pa&s;s from a condition in which every individual has an equal title to reign, into one in which they are equally de&s;tined to &s;erve. The &s;ame qualities in both, courage, popularity, addre&s;s, and military conduct, rai&s;e the ambitious to eminence. With the&s;e qualities, the citizen or the &s;lave ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;es from the ranks to the command of an army, from an ob&s;cure to an illu&s;trious &s;tation. In either, a &s;ingle per&s;on may rule with unlimited &s;way; and in both, the populace may break down every bar|rier of order, and re&s;traint of law.</P>
<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e that the equality e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong the &s;ubjects of a de&s;potic &s;tate, has in&s;pired its members with confidence, intrepidity, and the love of ju&s;tice; the de&s;potic prince, having cea&s;ed to be an object of fear, mu&s;t &s;ink among the croud. If, on the contrary, the per&s;onal equality which is enjoyed by the members of a democratical &s;tate, &s;hould be valued merely as an equal preten&s;ion
<PB N="107" REF="114">
to the objects of avarice and ambition, the mo|narch may &s;tart up anew, and be &s;upported by tho&s;e who mean to &s;hare in his profits. When the covetous and mercenary a&s;&s;emble in parties, it is of no con&s;equence under what leader they in|li&s;t, whether Cae&s;ar or Pompey; the hopes of ra|pine or power are the only motives from which they become attached to either.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;order of corrupted &s;ocieties, the &s;cene has been frequently changed from democracy to de&s;poti&s;m, and from the la&s;t too, in its turn, to the fir&s;t. From amid&s;t the democracy of corrupt men, and from a &s;cene of lawle&s;s con&s;u&s;ion, the tyrant a&s;cends a throne with arms reeking in blood. But his abu&s;es, or his weakne&s;&s;es, in the &s;tation which he has gained, in their turn, awaken and give way to the &s;pirit of mutiny and revenge. The cries of murder and de&s;olation, which in the ordinary cour&s;e of military government terrified the &s;ubject in his private retreat, are carried through the vaults, and made to pierce the grates and iron doors of the &s;eraglio. Democracy &s;eems to revive in a &s;cene of wild di&s;order and tumult: but both the extremes are but the tran&s;ient fits of paroxy&s;m or languor in a di&s;tempered &s;tate.</P>
<P>IF men be any where arrived at this mea&s;ure of depravity, there appears no immediate hope of redre&s;s. Neither the a&s;cendency of the multi|tude, nor that of the tyrant, will &s;ecure the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice: neither the licence of mere tumult, nor the calm of dejection and &s;ervitude, will teach the citizen that he was born for candour and affection to his fellow-creatures. And if the

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Informations on this &s;ubject which are de|rived from Antiquity.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of mankind is confined with|in a limited period, and from every quar|ter brings an intimation that human affairs have had a beginning. Nations, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of arts, and the felicity of their po|litical e&s;tabli&s;hments, have been derived from a feeble original, and &s;till pre&s;erve in their &s;tory the indications of a &s;low and gradual progre&s;s, by which this di&s;tinction was gained. The antiqui|ties of every people, however diver&s;ified, and how|ever di&s;gui&s;ed, contain the &s;ame information on this point.</P>
<P>IN &s;acred hi&s;tory, we find the parents of the &s;pecies, as yet a &s;ingle pair, &s;ent forth to inherit the earth, and to force a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves amid&s;t the briers and thorns which were made to
<PB N="110" REF="117">
abound on its &s;urface. Their race, which was again reduced to a few, had to &s;truggle with the dangers that await a weak and infant &s;pecies; and after many ages elap&s;ed, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable na|tions took their ri&s;e from one or a few families that had pa&s;tured their flocks in the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>THE Grecians derive their own origin from un&s;ettled tribes, who&s;e frequent migrations are a proof of the rude and infant &s;tate of their commu|nities; and who&s;e warlike exploits, &s;o much cele|brated in &s;tory, only exhibit the &s;truggles with which they di&s;puted for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a country they afterwards, by their talent for fable, by their arts, and their policy, rendered &s;o famous in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>ITALY mu&s;t have been divided into many rude and feeble cantons, when a band of robbers, as we are taught to con&s;ider them, found a &s;ecure &s;ettlement on the banks of the Tiber, and when a people, yet compo&s;ed only of one &s;ex, &s;u&s;tained the character of a nation. Rome, for many ages, &s;aw, from her walls, on every &s;ide, the territory of her enemies, and found as little to check or to &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> the weakne&s;s of her infant power, as &s;he did afterwards to re&s;train the progre&s;s of her extended empire. Like a Tartar or a Scythian horde, which had pitched on a &s;ettlement, this na&s;cent community was equal, if not &s;uperior, to every tribe in its neighbourhood; and the oak which has covered the field with its &s;hade, was once a feeble plant in the nur&s;ery, and not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the weeds by which its early growth was re|&s;trained.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="118">
THE Gauls and the Germans are come to our knowledge with the marks of a &s;imilar condition; and the inhabitants of Britain, at the time of the fir&s;t Roman inva&s;ions, re&s;embled, in many things, the pre&s;ent natives of North America: they were ignorant of agriculture; they painted their bodies; and u&s;ed for cloathing, the &s;kins of bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>SUCH therefore appears to have been the com|mencement of hi&s;tory with all nations, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances are we to look for the original cha|racter of mankind. The inquiry refers to a di|&s;tant period, and every conclu&s;ion &s;hould build on the facts which are pre&s;erved for our u&s;e. Our method, notwith&s;tanding, too frequently, is to re&s;t the whole on conjecture; to impute every ad|vantage of our nature to tho&s;e arts which we our|&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s; and to imagine, that a mere nega|tion of all our virtues is a &s;ufficient de&s;cription of man in his original &s;tate. We are our&s;elves the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tandards of politene&s;s and civilization; and where our own features do not appear, we ap|prehend, that there is nothing which de&s;erves to be known. But it is probable that here, as in many other ca&s;es, we are ill qualified, from our &s;uppo&s;ed knowledge of cau&s;es, to progno&s;ticate effects, or to determine what mu&s;t have been the properties and operations, even of our own nature, in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e circum&s;tances in which we have &s;een it engaged. Who would, from mere conjecture, &s;uppo&s;e, that the naked &s;avage would be a coxcomb and a game&s;ter? that he would be proud and vain, without the di&s;tinctions of title and fortune? and that his principal care would be to adorn his per&s;on, and to find an amu&s;ement?
<PB N="112" REF="119">
Even if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would thus &s;hare in our vices, and, in the mid&s;t of his fore&s;t, vie with the follies which are practi&s;ed in the town; yet no one would be &s;o bold as to affirm, that he would likewi&s;e, in any in&s;tance, excel us in talents and virtues; that he would have a pene|tration, a force of imagination and elocution, an ardour of mind, an affection and courage, which the arts, the di&s;cipline, and the policy of few nations would be able to improve. Yet the&s;e par|ticulars are a part in the de&s;cription which is deli|vered by tho&s;e who have had opportunities of &s;ee|ing mankind in their rude&s;t condition: and be|yond the reach of &s;uch te&s;timony, we can neither &s;afely take, nor pretend to give, information on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IF conjectures and opinions formed at a di|&s;tance, have not &s;ufficient authority in the hi&s;tory of mankind, the dome&s;tic antiquities of every nation mu&s;t, for this very rea&s;on, be received with caution. They are, for mo&s;t part, the mere con|jectures or the fictions of &s;ub&s;equent ages, and even where at fir&s;t they contained &s;ome re&s;em|blance of truth, they &s;till vary with the imagina|tion of tho&s;e by whom they are tran&s;mitted, and in every generation receive a different form. They are made to bear the &s;tamp of the times through which they have pa&s;&s;ed in the form of tradition, not of the ages to which their pretended de&s;crip|tions relate. The information they bring, is not like the light reflected from a mirrour, which de|lineates the object from which it originally came; but, like rays that come broken and di&s;per&s;ed from an opaque or unpoli&s;hed &s;urface, only give
<PB N="113" REF="120">
the colours and features of the body from which they were la&s;t reflected.</P>
<P>WHEN traditionary fables are rehear&s;ed by the vulgar, they bear the marks of a national cha|racter; and though mixed with ab&s;urdities, of|ten rai&s;e the imagination, and move the heart: when made the materials of poetry, and adorned by the &s;kill and the eloquence of an ardent and &s;uperior mind, they in&s;truct the under&s;tanding, as well as engage the pa&s;&s;ions. It is only in the ma|nagement of mere antiquaries, or &s;tript of the ornaments which the laws of hi&s;tory forbid them to wear, that they become even unfit to amu&s;e the fancy, or to &s;erve any purpo&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>IT were ab&s;urd to quote the fable of the Iliad or Ody&s;&s;ey, the legends of Hercules, The&s;eus, or OEdipus, as authorities in matter of fact relating to the hi&s;tory of mankind; but they may, with great ju&s;tice, be cited to a&s;certain what were the conceptions and &s;entiments of the age in which they were compo&s;ed, or to characteri&s;e the genius of that people, with who&s;e imaginations they were blended, and by whom they were fondly rehear&s;ed and admired.</P>
<P>IN this manner fiction may be admitted to vouch for the genius of nations, while hi&s;tory has nothing to offer that is intitled to credit. The Greek fable accordingly conveying a character of its authors, throws light on an age of which no other record remains. The &s;uperiority of this peo|ple is indeed in no circum&s;tance more evident than in the &s;train of their fictions, and in the &s;tory of tho&s;e fabulous heroes, poets, and &s;ages, who&s;e tales, being invented or embelli&s;hed by an imagi|nation
<PB N="114" REF="121">
already filled with the &s;ubject for which the hero was celebrated, &s;erved to inflame that ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m with which this people afterwards pro|ceeded in the pur&s;uit of every national object.</P>
<P>IT was no doubt of great advantage to tho&s;e nations, that their &s;y&s;tem of fable was original, and being already received in popular traditions, &s;erved to diffu&s;e tho&s;e improvements of rea&s;on, ima|gination, and &s;entiment, which were afterwards, by men of the fine&s;t talents, made on the fable it&s;elf, or conveyed in its moral. The pa&s;&s;ions of the poet pervaded the minds of the people, and the conceptions of men of genius being commu|nicated to the vulgar, became the incentives of a national &s;pirit.</P>
<P>A MYTHOLOGY borrowed from abroad, a lite|rature founded on references to a &s;trange country, and fraught with foreign allu&s;ions, are much more confined in their u&s;e: they &s;peak to the learned alone; and though intended to inform the under|&s;tanding, and to mend the heart, may, by being confined to a few, have an oppo&s;ite effect: they may fo&s;ter conceit on the ruins of common &s;en&s;e, and render what was, at lea&s;t innocently, &s;ung by the Athenian mariner at his oar, or rehear&s;ed by the &s;hepherd in attending his flock, an occa&s;ion of vice, and the foundation of pedantry and &s;chola&s;tic pride.</P>
<P>OUR very learning, perhaps, where its in|fluence extends, &s;erves, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to de|pre&s;s our national &s;pirit. Our literature being de+rived from nations of a different race, who flou+ri&s;hed at a time when our ance&s;tors were in a &s;tat
<PB N="115" REF="122">
of barbarity, and con&s;equently when they were de|&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e who had attained to the literary arts, has given ri&s;e to a humbling opinion, that we our&s;elves are the offspring of mean and con|temptible nations, with whom the human imagi|nation and &s;entiment had no effect, till the genius was in a manner in&s;pired by examples, and di|rected by le&s;&s;ons that were brought from abroad. The Romans, from whom our accounts are chiefly derived, have admitted, in the rudene&s;s of their own ance&s;tors, a &s;y&s;tem of virtues, which all &s;imple nations perhaps equally po&s;&s;e&s;s; a contempt of riches, love of their country, patience of hard&s;hip, danger, and fatigue. They have, notwith&s;tand|ing, vilified our ance&s;tors for having perhaps only re&s;embled their own; at lea&s;t, in the defect of their arts, and in the neglect of conveniencies which tho&s;e arts are employed to procure.</P>
<P>IT is from the Greek and the Roman hi&s;torians, however, that we have not only the mo&s;t authen|tic and in&s;tructive, but even the mo&s;t engaging, repre&s;entations of the tribes from whom we de|&s;cend. Tho&s;e &s;ublime and intelligent writers un|der&s;tood human nature, and could collect its fea|tures, and exhibit its characters in every &s;ituation. They were ill &s;ucceeded in this ta&s;k by the early hi&s;torians of modern Europe; who, generally bred to the profe&s;&s;ion of monks, and confined to the mona&s;tic life, applied them&s;elves to record what they were plea&s;ed to denominate facts, while they &s;uffered the productions of genius to peri&s;h, and were unable, either by the matter they &s;elected, or the &s;tyle of their compo&s;itions, to give any repre|&s;entation of the active &s;pirit of mankind in any condition. With them, a narration was &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="116" REF="123">
to con&s;titute hi&s;tory, whil&s;t it did not convey any knowledge of men; and hi&s;tory it&s;elf was allowed to be complete, while, amid&s;t the events and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes that are recorded in the or|der of time, we are left to look in vain for tho&s;e characteri&s;tics of the under&s;tanding and the heart, which alone, in every human tran&s;action, render the &s;tory either engaging or u&s;eful.</P>
<P>WE therefore willingly quit the hi&s;tory of our early ance&s;tors, where Cae&s;ar and Tacitus have dropped them; and perhaps, till we come within the reach of what is connected with pre&s;ent affairs, and makes a part in the &s;y&s;tem on which we now proceed, have little rea&s;on to expect any &s;ubject to intere&s;t or inform the mind. We have no rea|&s;on, however, from hence to conclude, that the matter it&s;elf was more barren, or the &s;cene of human affairs le&s;s intere&s;ting, in modern Europe, than it has been on every &s;tage where mankind were engaged to exhibit the movements of the heart, the efforts of genero&s;ity, magnanimity, and courage.</P>
<P>THE trial of what tho&s;e ages contained, is not even fairly made, when men of genius and di|&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, with the accompli&s;hments of a learned and a poli&s;hed age, collect the materials they have found, and, with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, connect the &s;tory of illiterate ages with tran&s;actions of a later date: it is difficult even for them, under the names which are applied in a new &s;tate of &s;ociety, to convey a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of what mankind were in &s;ituations &s;o different, and in times &s;o re|mote from their own.</P>

OF the nations who dwell in tho&s;e, or any other of the le&s;s cultivated parts of the earth, &s;ome intru&s;t their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence chiefly to hunting, fi&s;hing, or the natural produce of the &s;oil. They have little attention to property, and &s;carcely any beginnings of &s;ubordination or government. Others having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of herds, and depend|ing for their provi&s;ion on pa&s;ture, know what it is to be poor and rich. They know the relations of patron and client, of &s;ervant and ma&s;ter, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be cla&s;&s;ed according to their mea&s;ures of wealth. This di&s;tinction mu&s;t create a material difference of character, and may furni&s;h two &s;eparate heads, under which to con&s;ider the hi&s;tory of mankind in their rude&s;t &s;tate; that of the &s;avage, who is not yet acquainted with pro|perty; and that of the barbarian, to whom it is, although not a&s;certained by laws, a principal ob|ject of care and de&s;ire.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t appear very evident, that property is a matter of progre&s;s. It requires, among other particulars which are the effects of time, &s;ome me|thod of defining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The very de&s;ire of it proceeds from experience; and the indu&s;try by which it is gained, or improved, requires &s;uch a habit of acting with a view to di&s;tant objects, as may overcome the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition either to &s;loth or to enjoyment. This habit is &s;lowly acquired, and is in reality a principal di&s;tinction of nations in the advanced &s;tate of mechanic and commercial arts.</P>
<P>IN a tribe which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by hunting and fi&s;h|ing, the arms, the uten&s;ils, and the fur, which
<PB N="121" REF="128">
the individual carries, are to him the only &s;ubjects of property. The food of to morrow is yet wild in the fore&s;t, or hid in the lake; it cannot be ap|propriated before it is caught; and even then, being the purcha&s;e of numbers, who fi&s;h or hunt in a body, it accrues to the community, and is applied to immediate u&s;e, or becomes an acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;tores of the public.</P>
<P>WHERE &s;avage nations, as in mo&s;t parts of America, mix with the practice of hunting &s;ome &s;pecies of rude agriculture, they &s;till follow, with re&s;pect to the &s;oil and the fruits of the earth, the analogy of their principal object. As the men hunt, &s;o the women labour together; and after they have &s;hared the toils of the &s;eed-time, they enjoy the fruits of the harve&s;t in common. The field in which they have planted, like the di&s;trict over which they are accu&s;tomed to hunt, is claimed as a property by the nation, but is not parcelled in lots to its members. They go forth in parties to prepare the ground, to plant, and to reap. The harve&s;t is gathered into the public granary, and from thence, at &s;tated times, is divided into &s;hares for the maintenance of &s;eparate families.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Caribbees.</NOTE> Even the returns of the market, when they trade with foreigners, are brought home to the &s;tock of the nation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS the fur and the bow pertain to the indi|vidual, the cabbin and its uten&s;ils are appropriated to the family; and as the dome&s;tic cares are com|mitted

to the women, &s;o the property of the hou&s;e|hold &s;eems likewi&s;e to be ve&s;ted in them. The children are con&s;idered as pertaining to the mother, with little regard to de&s;cent on the father's &s;ide. The males, before they are married, remain in the cabbin in which they are born; but after they have formed a new connection with the other &s;ex, they change their habitation, and become an ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the family in which they have found their wives. The hunter and the warrior are numbered by the matron as a part of her trea|&s;ure; they are re&s;erved for perils and trying occa|&s;ions; and in the rece&s;s of public councils, in the intervals of hunting or war, are maintained by the cares of the women, and loiter about in mere amu&s;ement or &s;loth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lafitau.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE one &s;ex continue to value them&s;elves chiefly on their courage, their talent for policy, and their warlike atchievments, this &s;pecies of property which is be&s;towed on the other, is in reality a mark of &s;ubjection; not, as &s;ome writers alledge, of their having acquired an a&s;cendant<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. It is the care and trouble of a &s;ubject with which the warrior does not chu&s;e to be embarra&s;&s;ed. It is a &s;ervitude, and a continual toil, where no ho|nours are won; and they who&s;e province it is, are in fact the &s;laves and the helots of their coun|try. If in this de&s;tination of the &s;exes, while the men continue to indulge them&s;elves in the con|tempt of &s;ordid and mercenary arts, the cruel e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;lavery is for &s;ome ages deferred;
<PB N="123" REF="130">
if in this tender, though unequal alliance, the af|fections of the heart prevent the &s;everities practi&s;ed on &s;laves; we have in the cu&s;tom it&s;elf, as per|haps in many other in&s;tances, rea&s;on to prefer the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions of nature, to many of her after refinements.</P>
<P>IF mankind, in any in&s;tance, continue the arti|cle of property on the footing we have now re|pre&s;ented, we may ea&s;ily credit what is farther re|ported by travellers, that they admit of no di&s;tinc|tions of rank or condition; and that they have in fact no degree of &s;ubordination different from the di&s;tribution of function, which follows the differences of age, talents, and di&s;po&s;itions. Per|&s;onal qualities give an a&s;cendant in the mid&s;t of occa&s;ions which require their exertion; but in times of relaxation, leave no ve&s;tige of power or prerogative. A warrior who has led the youth of his nation to the &s;laughter of their enemies, or who has been foremo&s;t in the chace, returns upon a le|vel with the re&s;t of his tribe; and when the only bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;leep, or to feed, can enjoy no pre|eminence; for he &s;leeps and he feeds no better than they.</P>
<P>WHERE no profit attends dominion, one party is as much aver&s;e to the trouble of perpetual com|mand, as the other is to the mortification of per|petual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:

<P>THE character of the mind, however, in this &s;tate, is not founded on ignorance alone. Men are con&s;cious of their equality, and are tenacious of its rights.

<P>THIS de&s;cription, we may believe, is unequally applicable to different nations, who have made unequal advances in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of property. Among the Caribbees, and the other natives of the warmer climates in America, the dignity of chief|tain is hereditary, or elective, and continued for life: the unequal di&s;tribution of property creates a vi&s;ible &s;ubordination<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wafer's account of the I&s;thmus of Darien.</NOTE>. But among the Iroquois, and other nations of the temperate zone, the titles of <HI>magi&s;trate</HI> and <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> of <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>mean,</HI> are as little known as tho&s;e of <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>poor.</HI> The old men, without being inve&s;ted with any coer|cive power, employ their natural authority in ad|vi&s;ing or in prompting the re&s;olutions of their tribe: the military leader is pointed out by the &s;uperiority of his manhood and valour: the &s;tate&s;man is di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the attention with which his coun&s;el is heard; the warrior by the confidence with which the youth of his nation fol|low

<P>IN the&s;e happy, though informal, proceedings, where age alone gives a place in the council; where youth, ardour, and valour in the field, give a title to the &s;tation of leader; where the whole community is a&s;&s;embled on any alarming occa&s;ion, we may venture to &s;ay, that we have found the origin of the &s;enate, the executive power, and the a&s;&s;embly of the people; in&s;titutions for which an|cient legi&s;lators have been &s;o much renowned. The &s;enate among the Greeks, as well as the La|tins, appears, from the etymology of its name, to have been originally compo&s;ed of elderly men. The military leader at Rome, in a manner not unlike to that of the American warrior, proclaimed his levies, and the citizen prepared for the field, in con&s;equence of a voluntary engagement. The &s;ugge&s;tions of nature, which directed the policy of nations in the wilds of America, were followed before on the banks of the Eurotas and the Tyber; and Lycurgus and Romulus found the model of their in&s;titution where the members of every rude nation find the earlie&s;t mode of uniting their ta|lents, and combining their forces.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133">
AMONG the North-American nations, every in|dividual is independent; but he is engaged by his affections and his habits in the cares of a fa|mily. Families, like &s;o many &s;eparate tribes, are &s;ubject to no in&s;pection or government from abroad; whatever pa&s;&s;es at home, even blood&s;hed and murder, are only &s;uppo&s;ed to concern them|&s;elves. They are, in the mean time, the parts of a canton; the women a&s;&s;emble to plant their maize; the old men go to council; the hunt&s;man and the warrior joins the youth of his village in the field. Many &s;uch cantons a&s;&s;emble to con&s;titute a na|tional council, or to execute a national enterpri&s;e. When the Europeans made their fir&s;t &s;ettlements in America, &s;ix &s;uch nations had formed a league, had their amphyctiones or &s;tates-general, and, by the firmne&s;s of their union, and the ability of their councils, had obtained an a&s;cendant from the mouth of the St. Laurence to that of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lafitau, Charlevoix, Colden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. They appeared to under&s;tand the objects of the confederacy, as well as tho&s;e of the &s;eparate nation; they &s;tudied a balance of power; the &s;tate&s;man of one country watched the de&s;igns and proceedings of another; and occa&s;ionally threw the weight of his tribe into a different &s;cale. They had their alliances and their treaties, which, like the nations of Europe, they maintained, or they broke, upon rea&s;ons of &s;tate; and remained at peace from a &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity or expediency, and went to war upon any emergence of provoca|tion or jealou&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">
THUS, without any &s;ettled form of govern|ment, or any bond of union, but what re&s;embled more the &s;ugge&s;tion of in&s;tinct, than the invention of rea&s;on, they conducted them&s;elves with the con|cert, and the force, of nations. Foreigners, with|out being able to di&s;cover who is the magi&s;trate, or in what manner the &s;enate is compo&s;ed, always find a council with whom they may treat, or a band of warriors with whom they may fight. Without police or compul&s;ory laws, their dome&s;tic &s;ociety is conducted with order, and the ab&s;ence of vicious di&s;po&s;itions, is a better &s;ecurity than any public e&s;tabli&s;hment for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of crimes.</P>
<P>DISORDERS, however, &s;ometimes occur, e&s;pe|cially in times of debauch, when the immoderate u&s;e of intoxicating liquors, to which they are ex|tremely addicted, &s;u&s;pends the ordinary caution of their demeanour, and inflaming their violent pa&s;|&s;ions, engages them in quarrels and blood&s;hed. When a per&s;on is &s;lain, his murderer is &s;eldom called to an immediate account: but he has a quarrel to &s;u&s;tain with the family and the friends; or, if a &s;tranger, with the countrymen of the de|cea&s;ed; &s;ometimes even with his own nation at home, if the injury committed be of a kind to alarm the &s;ociety. The nation, the canton, or the family, endeavour, by pre&s;ents, to atone for the offence of any of their members; and, by paci|fying the parties aggrieved, endeavour to prevent what alarms the community more than the fir&s;t di&s;order, the &s;ub&s;equent effects of revenge and animo&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lafitau.</NOTE>. The &s;hedding of blood, however, if
<PB N="128" REF="135">
the guilty per&s;on remain where he has committed the crime, &s;eldom e&s;capes unpuni&s;hed: the friend of the decea&s;ed knows how to di&s;gui&s;e, though not to &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment; and even after many years have elap&s;ed, is &s;ure to repay the injury that was done to his kindred or his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations render them cautious and circum&s;pect, put them on their guard again&s;t their pa&s;&s;ions, and give to their ordinary deport|ment an air of phlegm and compo&s;ure &s;uperior to what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed among poli&s;hed nations. They are, in the mean time, affectionate in their car|riage, and in their conver&s;ations pay a mutual at|tention and regard, &s;ays Charlevoix, more tender and more engaging, than what we profe&s;s in the ceremonial of poli&s;hed &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>THIS writer has ob&s;erved, that the nations among whom he travelled in North America, ne|ver mentioned acts of genero&s;ity or kindne&s;s un|der the notion of duty. They acted from affec|tion, as they acted from appetite, without regard to its con&s;equences. When they had done a kind|ne&s;s, they had gratified a de&s;ire; the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, and it pa&s;&s;ed from the memory. When they received a favour, it might, or it might not, prove the occa&s;ion of friend&s;hip: if it did not, the parties appeared to have no apprehen&s;ions of gra|titude, as a duty by which the one was bound to make a return, or the other intitled to reproach the per&s;on who had failed in his part. The &s;pi|rit with which they give or receive pre&s;ents, is the &s;ame which Tacitus ob&s;erved among the ancient Germans: They delight in them, but do not

con&s;ider them as matter of obligation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muneribus gaudent, &s;ed nec data imputant, noc acceptis obligantur.</NOTE>. Such gifts are of little con&s;equence, except when em|ployed as the &s;eal of a bargain or treaty.</P>
<P>IT was their favourite maxim, That no man is naturally indebted to another; that he is not, therefore, obliged to bear with any impo&s;ition, or unequal treatment<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix.</NOTE>. Thus, in a principle ap|parently fullen and inho&s;pitable, they have di&s;|covered the foundation of ju&s;tice, and ob&s;erve its rules with a &s;teadine&s;s and candour which no culti|vation has been found to improve. The freedom which they give in what relates to the &s;uppo&s;ed duties of kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip, &s;erves only to engage the heart more entirely, where it is once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with affection. We love to chu&s;e our ob|ject without any re&s;traint, and we con&s;ider kind|ne&s;s it&s;elf as a talk, when the duties of friend&s;hip are exacted by rule. We therefore, by our de|mand for attentions, rather corrupt than improve the &s;y&s;tem of morality; and by our exactions of gratitude, and our frequent propo&s;als to inforce its ob&s;ervance, we only &s;hew, that we have mi&s;taken its nature; we only give &s;ymptoms of that grow|ing &s;en&s;ibility to intere&s;t, from which we mea&s;ure the expediency of friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity it&s;elf; and by which we would introduce the &s;pirit of traffic into the commerce of affection. In con|&s;equence of this proceeding, we are often obliged to decline a favour with the &s;ame &s;pirit that we throw off a &s;ervile engagement, or reject a bribe.

To the unrefining &s;avage every favour is wel|come, and every pre&s;ent received without re&s;erve or reflection.</P>
<P>THE love of equality, and the love of ju&s;tice, were originally the &s;ame: and although, by the con&s;titution of different &s;ocieties, unequal privi|leges are be&s;towed on their members; and al|though ju&s;tice it&s;elf requires a proper regard to be paid to &s;uch privileges; yet he who has forgotten that men were originally equal, ea&s;ily degenerates into a &s;lave or in the capacity of a ma&s;ter, is not to be tru&s;ted with the rights of his fellow-creatures. This happy principle gives to the mind its &s;en&s;e of independence, renders it indifferent to the fa|vours which are in the power of other men, checks it in the commi&s;&s;ion of injuries, and leaves the heart open to the affections of genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s. It gives to the untutored American that air of can|dour, and of regard to the welfare of others, which, in &s;ome degree, &s;oftens the arrogant pride of his carriage, and in times of confidence and peace, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of government or law, renders the approach and commerce of &s;trangers &s;ecure.</P>

<P>CONFIDENCE in the effect of &s;uper&s;titious ob|&s;ervances is not peculiar to any age or nation. Few, even of the accompli&s;hed Greeks and Romans, were able to &s;hake off this weakne&s;s. In their ca&s;e, it was not removed by the highe&s;t mea&s;ures of civilization. It has yielded only to the light of true religion, or to the &s;tudy of nature, by which we are led to &s;ub&s;titute a wi&s;e providence oper|ating by phy&s;ical cau&s;es, in the place of phantoms that terrify or amu&s;e the ignorant.</P>
<P>THE principal point of honour among the rude nations of America, as indeed in every in|&s;tance where mankind are not greatly corrupted, is &s;ortitude. Yet their way of maintaining this point of honour, is very different from that of the nations of Europe. Their ordinary method of making war is by ambu&s;cade; and they &s;trive, by over-reaching an enemy, to commit the greate&s;t &s;laughter, or to make the greate&s;t number of pri|&s;oners, with the lea&s;t hazard to them&s;elves. They deem it a folly to expo&s;e their own per&s;ons in a&s;&s;aulting an enemy, and do not rejoice in victories which are &s;tained with the blood of their own peo|ple. They do not value them&s;elves, as in Europe, on defying their enemy upon equal terms. They
<PB N="134" REF="141">
even boa&s;t, that they approach like foxes, or that they fly like birds, not le&s;s than that they devour like lions. In Europe, to fall in battle is account|ed an honour; among the natives of America, it is reckoned di&s;graceful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix.</NOTE>. They re&s;erve their for|titude for the trials they abide when attacked by &s;urpri&s;e, or when fallen into their enemies hands; and when they are obliged to maintain their own honour, and that of their nation, in the mid&s;t of torments that require efforts of patience more than of valour.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e occa&s;ions, they are far from allowing it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they wi&s;h to decline the con|flict. It is held infamous to avoid it, even by a voluntary death; and the greate&s;t affront which can be offered to a pri&s;oner, is to refu&s;e him the honours of a man, in the manner of his executi|on: <Q>With-hold,</Q> &s;ays an old man, in the mid&s;t of his torture,
<Q>the &s;tabs of your knife; rather let me die by fire, that tho&s;e dogs, your allies, from beyond the &s;eas, may learn to &s;uffer like men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colden.</NOTE>.</Q>
With terms of defiance, the victim, in tho&s;e &s;olemn trials, commonly excites the ani|mo&s;ity of his tormentors, as well as his own; and whil&s;t we &s;uffer for human nature, under the ef|fect of its errors, we mu&s;t admire its force.</P>
<P>THE people with whom this practice prevailed, were commonly de&s;irous of repairing their own lo&s;&s;es, by adopting pri&s;oners of war into their fa|milies: and even in the la&s;t moment, the hand
<PB N="135" REF="142">
which was rai&s;ed to torment, frequently gave the &s;ign of adoption, by which the pri&s;oner became the child or the brother of his enemy, and came to &s;hare in all the privileges of a citizen. In their treatment of tho&s;e who &s;uffered, they did not appear to be guided by principles of hatred or revenge: they ob&s;erved the point of honour in applying as well as in bearing their torments; and, by a &s;trange kind of affection and tender|ne&s;s, were directed to be mo&s;t cruel where they intended the highe&s;t re&s;pect: the coward was put to immediate death by the hands of women: the valiant was &s;uppo&s;ed to be intitled to all the trials of fortitude that men could invent or employ: <Q>It gave me joy,</Q> &s;ays an old man to his cap|tive,
<Q>that &s;o gallant a youth was allotted to my &s;hare: I propo&s;ed to have placed you on the couch of my nephew, who was &s;lain by your countrymen; to have transferred all my tender|ne&s;s to you; and to have &s;olaced my age in your company: but maimed and mutilated as you now appear, death is better than life: prepare your&s;elf therefore to die like a man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>IT might be apprehended, that among rude nations, where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are pro|cured with &s;o much difficulty, the mind could ne|ver rai&s;e it&s;elf above the con&s;ideration of this &s;ub|ject; and that man would, in this condition, give examples of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t mercenary &s;pi|rit. The rever&s;e, however is true. Directed in this particular by the de&s;ires of nature, men, in their &s;imple&s;t &s;tate, attend to the objects of ap|petite no further than appetite requires; and their de&s;ires of fortune extend no further than the meal which gratifies their hunger: they apprehend no &s;u|periority of rank in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, &s;uch as might in&s;pire any habitual principle of covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, vanity, or ambition: they can apply to no ta&s;k that engages no immediate pa&s;&s;ion, and take plea&s;ure in no occupation that affords no dan|gers to be braved, and no honours to be won.</P>
<P>IT was not among the ancient Romans alone that commercial arts, or a &s;ordid mind, were held in contempt. A like &s;pirit prevails in every rude and independent &s;ociety.

WERE Lycurgus employed anew to operate on the materials we have de&s;cribed, he would find them, in many important particulars, prepared by nature her&s;elf for his u&s;e. His equality in mat|ters of property being already e&s;tabli&s;hed, he would have no faction to apprehend from the oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;ts of the poor and the rich; his &s;enate, his a&s;|&s;embly of the people, is con&s;tituted; his di&s;cipline is in &s;ome mea&s;ure adopted; and the place of his helots is &s;upplied by the ta&s;k allotted to one of the &s;exes. With all the&s;e advantages, he would &s;till have had a very important le&s;&s;on for civil &s;ociety to teach, that by which a few learn to command, and the many are taught to obey: he would have all his precautions to take again&s;t the future in|tru&s;ion of mercenary arts, the admiration of lux|ury, and the pa&s;&s;ion for intere&s;t: he would &s;till perhaps have a more difficult ta&s;k than any of the former, in teaching his citizens the command of appetite, and an indifference to plea&s;ure, as well as a contempt of pain; in teaching them to main|tain, in the field, the formality of uniform pre|cautions, and as much to avoid being them&s;elves &s;urpri&s;ed, as they endeavour to &s;urpri&s;e their enemy.</P>
<P>FOR want of the&s;e advantages, rude nations in general, though they are patient of hard&s;hip and fatigue, though they are addicted to war, and are qualified by their &s;tratagem and valour to throw terror into the armies of a more regular enemy; yet, in the cour&s;e of a continued &s;truggle, al|ways yield to the &s;uperior arts, and the di&s;ci|pline of more civilized nations.

<HEAD>Of Rude Nations under the Impre&s;&s;ions of Pro|perty and Intere&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a proverbial imprecation in u&s;e among the hunting nations on the confines of Siberia, That their enemy might be obliged to live like a Tartar, and be &s;eized with the folly of breeding and attending his cattle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abulgaze's Genealogical Hi&s;tory of the Tartars.</NOTE>. Nature, it &s;eems, in their apprehen&s;ion, by &s;toring the woods and the de&s;ert with game, rendered the ta&s;k of the herd&s;|man unnece&s;&s;ary, and left to man only the trouble of &s;electing and of &s;eizing his prey.</P>
<P>THE indolence of mankind, or rather their a|ver&s;ion to any application in which they are not engaged by immediate in&s;tinct and pa&s;&s;ion, retards their progre&s;s in extending the notion of property. It has been found, however, even while the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are left in common, and the &s;tock of the public is yet undivided, that this notion is already applied to different &s;ubjects; as the &s;ur and the bow pertain to the individual; the cot|tage, with its furniture, are appropiated to the family.</P>
<P>WHEN the parent begins to de&s;ire a better provi&s;ion for his children than is &s;ound under the
<PB N="143" REF="150">
promi&s;cuous management of many copartners, when he has applied his labour and his &s;kill apart, he aims at an exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;eeks the property of the &s;oil, as well as the u&s;e of its fruits.</P>
<P>WHEN the individual no longer finds among his a&s;&s;ociates the &s;ame inclination to commit every &s;ubject to public u&s;e, he is &s;eized with concern for his per&s;onal fortune; and is alarmed by the cares which every per&s;on entertains for him&s;elf. He is urged as much by emulation and jealou&s;y, as by the &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. He &s;uffers con&s;ider|ations of intere&s;t to re&s;t on his mind, and when every pre&s;ent appetite is &s;ufficiently gratified, he can act with a view to futurity, or rather finds an object of vanity in having ama&s;&s;ed what is become a &s;ubject of competition, and a matter of univer|&s;al e&s;teem. Upon this motive, where violence is re&s;trained, he can apply his hand to lucrative arts, confine him&s;elf to a tedious ta&s;k, and wait with patience for the di&s;tant returns of his labour.</P>
<P>THUS mankind acquire indu&s;try by many and by &s;low degrees. They are taught to regard their intere&s;t; they are taught to ab&s;tain from unlaw|ful profits; they are &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they fairly obtain; and by the&s;e methods the habits of the labourer, the mechanic, and the tra|der, are gradualiy formed. A hoard, collected from the &s;imple productions of nature, or a herd of cattle, are, in every rude nation, the fir&s;t &s;pe|cies of wealth. The circum&s;tances of the &s;oil, and the climate, determine whether the inhabitant &s;hall apply him&s;elf chiefly to agriculture or pa&s;ture;
<PB N="144" REF="151">
whether he &s;hall fix his re&s;idence, or be moving continually about with all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN the we&s;t of Europe; in America, from &s;outh to north, with a few exceptions; in the torrid zone, and every where within the warmer climates; man|kind have generally applied them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;pecies of agriculture, and have been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ettlement. In the ea&s;t and the north of A&s;ia, they depended entirely on their herds, and were perpetually &s;hifting their ground in &s;earch of new pa&s;ture. The arts which pertain to &s;ettlement have been practi&s;ed, and variou&s;ly cultivated, by the in|habitants of Europe. Tho&s;e which are con&s;i&s;tent with perpetual migration, have, from the earlie&s;t accounts of hi&s;tory, remained nearly the &s;ame with the Scythian or Tartar. The tent pitched on a moveable carriage, the hor&s;e applied to every purpo&s;e of labour, and of war, of the dairy, and of the butcher's &s;tall, from the earlie&s;t to the late&s;t accounts, have made up the riches and equi|page of this wandering people.</P>
<P>BUT in whatever way rude nations &s;ub&s;i&s;t, there are certain points in which, under the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of property, they nearly agree. Ho|mer either lived with a people in this &s;tage of their progre&s;s, or found him&s;elf engaged to ex|hibit their character. Tacitus has made them the &s;ubject of a particular treati&s;e; and if this be an a&s;pect under which mankind de&s;erve to be viewed, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we have &s;ingular ad|vantages in collecting their features. The portrait has already been drawn by the able&s;t hands, and gives, at one view, in the writings of the&s;e cele|brated authors, whatever has been &s;cattered in the relations of hi&s;torians, or whatever we have op|portunities
<PB N="145" REF="152">
to ob&s;erve in the actual manners of men, who &s;till remain in a &s;imilar &s;tate.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ing from the condition we have de&s;cri|bed, to this we have at pre&s;ent in view, mankind &s;till retain many parts of their earlie&s;t character. They are &s;till aver&s;e to labour, addicted to war, admirers of fortitude, and, in the language of Tacitus, more lavi&s;h of their blood than of their &s;weat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Pigrum quin immo et iners videtur, &s;udore acquirere quod po&s;&s;is &s;anguine parare.</Q></NOTE>. They are fond of fanta&s;tic ornaments in their dre&s;s, and endeavour to fill up the li&s;tle&s;s intervals of a life addicted to violence, with ha|zardous &s;ports, and with games of chance. Every &s;ervile occupation they commit to women or &s;laves. But we may apprehend, that the individual having now found a &s;eparate intere&s;t, the bands of &s;o|ciety mu&s;t become le&s;s firm, and dome&s;tic di&s;or|ders more frequent. The members of any com|munity, being di&s;tingui&s;hed among them&s;elves by unequal &s;hares in the di&s;tribution of property, the ground of a permanent and palpable &s;ubordinati|on is laid.</P>
<P>THESE particulars accordingly take place a|mong mankind, in pa&s;&s;ing from the &s;avage to what may be called the barbarous &s;tate. Mem|bers of the &s;ame community enter into quarrels of competition or revenge. They unite in follow|ing leaders, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their for|tunes, and by the lu&s;tre of their birth. They join the de&s;ire of &s;poil with the love of glory; and from an opinion, that what is acquired by force,
<PB N="146" REF="153">
ju&s;tly pertains to the victor, they become hunters of men, and bring every conte&s;t to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word.</P>
<P>EVERY nation is a band of robbers, who prey without re&s;traint, or remor&s;e, on their neighbours. Cattle, &s;ays Achilles, may be &s;eized in every field; and the coa&s;ts of the Aegean &s;ea were accordingly pillaged by the heroes of Homer, for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e tho&s;e heroes cho&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the bra&s;s and iron, the cattle, the &s;laves, and the women, which were found among the nations around them.</P>
<P>A Tartar mounted on his hor&s;e, is an animal of prey, who only inquires where cattle are to be found, and how far he mu&s;t go to po&s;&s;e&s;s them. The monk, who had fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Mangu Chan, made his peace, by promi&s;ing, that the Pope, and the Chri&s;tian princes, &s;hould make a &s;urrender of all their herds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rubruquis.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar &s;pirit reigned, without exception, in all the barbarous nations of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa. The antiquities of Greece and Italy, and the fables of every ancient poet, contain examples of its force. It was this &s;pirit that brought our ance&s;tors fir&s;t into the provinces of the Roman empire; and that afterward, more perhaps than their reverence for the cro&s;s, led them to the Ea&s;t, to &s;hare with the Tartars in the &s;poils of the Sa|racen empire.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="154">
FROM the de&s;criptions contained in the la&s;t &s;ection, we may incline to believe, that mankind, in their &s;imple&s;t &s;tate, are on the eve of erecting republics. Their love of equality, their habit of a&s;&s;embling in public councils, and their zeal for the tribe to which they belong, are qualifications that fit them to act under that &s;pecies of govern|ment; and they &s;eem to have but a few &s;teps to make, in order to reach its e&s;tabli&s;hment. They have only to define the numbers of which their councils &s;hall con&s;i&s;t, and to &s;ettle the forms of their meeting: They have only to be&s;tow a per|manent authority for repre&s;&s;ing di&s;orders, and to enact a few rules in favour of that ju&s;tice they have already acknowledged, and from inclination &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e &s;teps are far from being &s;o ea&s;ily made, as they appear on a &s;light or a tran&s;ient view. The re&s;olution of chu&s;ing, from among their equals, the magi&s;trate to whom they give from thenceforward a right to controul their own actions, is far from the thoughts of &s;imple men; and no eloquence, perhaps, could make them a|dopt this mea&s;ure, or give them any &s;en&s;e of its u&s;e.</P>
<P>EVEN after nations have cho&s;en a military lead|er, they do not intru&s;t him with any &s;pecies of civil authority.

<P>POSSESSIONS de&s;cend, and the lu&s;tre of family grows brighter with age.

His followers take their place in &s;ubordi|nate &s;tations; and in&s;tead of con&s;idering them|&s;elves as parts of a community, they rank as the followers of a chieftain, and take their de&s;ignati|on from the name of their leader. They find a new object of public affection, in defending his per&s;on, and in &s;upporting his &s;tation; they lend of their &s;ub&s;tance to form his e&s;tate; they are guid|ed by his &s;miles and his frowns; and court, as the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, a &s;hare in the fea&s;t which their own contributions have furni&s;hed.</P>

MAN, in his animal capacity, is qualified to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in every climate. He reigns with the lion and the tyger under the equatorial heats of the &s;un, or he a&s;&s;ociates with the bear and the rain|deer beyond the polar circle. His ver&s;atile di&s;po|&s;ition fits him to a&s;&s;ume the habits of either con|dition, or his talent for arts enables him to &s;upply its defects. The intermediate climates, however, appear mo&s;t to favour his nature; and in what|ever manner we account for the fact, it cannot be doubted, that this animal has always attained to the principal honours of his &s;pecies within the temperate zone. The arts, which he has on this &s;cene repeatedly invented, the extent of his rea|&s;on, the fertility of his fancy, and the force of his genius in literature, commerce, policy, and war, &s;ufficiently declare either a di&s;tingui&s;hed advantage of &s;ituation, or a natural &s;uperiority of mind.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable races of men, it is true, have been rude before they were poli&s;hed. They have in &s;ome ca&s;es returned to rudene&s;s again: and it is not from the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of arts, &s;cience, or policy, that we are to pronounce of their genius.</P>
<P>THERE is a vigour, a reach of capacity, and a &s;en&s;ibility of mind, which may characteri&s;e as well the &s;avage as the citizen, the &s;lave as well as the ma&s;ter; and the &s;ame powers of the mind may be turned to a variety of purpo&s;es. A mo|dern Greek, perhaps, is mi&s;chievous, &s;lavi&s;h, and cunning, from the &s;ame animated temperament that made his ance&s;tor ardent, ingenious, and bold, in the camp, or in the council of his nation.

A modern Italian is di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;en&s;ibility, quickne&s;s, and art, while he employs on trifles the capacity of an ancient Roman; and exhibits now, in the &s;cene of amu&s;ement, and in the &s;earch of a frivolous applau&s;e, that fire, and tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, with which Gracchus burned in the Fo|rum, and &s;hook the a&s;&s;emblies of a &s;everer peo|ple.</P>
<P>THE commercial and lucrative arts have been, in &s;ome climates, the principal object of mankind, and have been retained through every di&s;a&s;ter; in others, even under all the fluctuations of fortune, they have &s;till been neglected; while in the tem|perate climates of Europe and A&s;ia, they have had their ages of admiration as well as con|tempt.</P>
<P>IN one &s;tate of &s;ociety, arts are &s;lighted, from that very ardour of mind, and principle of acti|vity, by which, in another, they are practi&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. While men are ingro&s;&s;ed by their pa&s;&s;ions, heated and rou&s;ed by the &s;truggles and dangers of their country; while the trumpet &s;ounds, or the alarm of &s;ocial engagement is rung, and the heart beats high, it were a mark of dull|ne&s;s, or of an abject &s;pirit, to find lei&s;ure for the &s;tudy of ea&s;e, or the pur&s;uit of improvements, which have mere convenience or ea&s;e for their ob|ject.</P>
<P>THE frequent vici&s;&s;itudes and rever&s;es of for|tune, which nations have experienced on that very ground where the arts have pro&s;pered, are proba|bly the effects of a bu&s;y, inventive, and ver&s;atile &s;pirit, by which men have carried every national

pur&s;uit to extremes. They have rai&s;ed the fabric of de&s;potic empire to its greate&s;t height, where they had be&s;t under&s;tood the foundations of free|dom.

<P>ON this &s;cene, mankind have twice, within the compa&s;s of hi&s;tory, a&s;cended from rude begin|nings to very high degrees of refinement. In every age, whether de&s;tined by its temporary di&s;|po&s;ition to build or to de&s;troy, they have left the ve&s;tiges of an active and vehement &s;pirit. The pavement and the ruins of Rome are buried in du&s;t, &s;haken from the feet of barbarians, who trod with contempt on the refinements of luxury, and &s;purned tho&s;e arts, the u&s;e of which it was re&s;erved for the po&s;terity of the &s;ame people to di&s;cover and to admire. The tents of the wild Arab are even now pitched among the ruins of magnificent cities; and the wa&s;te fields which bor|der on Pale&s;tine and Syria, are perhaps become again the nur&s;ery of infant nations. The chieftain of an Arab tribe, like the founder of Rome, may have already fixed the roots of a plant that is to flouri&s;h in &s;ome future period, or laid the foun|dations of a fabric, that will attain to its grandeur in &s;ome di&s;tant age.</P>

<P>THE &s;un, it &s;eems, which ripens the pine|apple and the tamarind, in&s;pires a degree of mild|ne&s;s that can even a&s;&s;uage the rigours of de&s;poti|cal government: and &s;uch is the effect of a gentle and pacific di&s;po&s;ition in the natives of the Ea&s;t, that no conque&s;t, no irruption of barbarians, ter|minates, as they did among the &s;tubborn natives of Europe, by a total de&s;truction of what the love of ea&s;e and of plea&s;ure had produced.</P>
<P>TRANSFERRED, without any great &s;truggle, from one ma&s;ter to another, the natives of India are ready, upon every change, to pur&s;ue their in|du&s;try, to acquie&s;ce in the enjoyment of life, and the hopes of animal plea&s;ure: the wars of con|que&s;t are not prolonged to exa&s;perate the parties engaged in them, or to de&s;olate the land for
<PB N="166" REF="172">
which tho&s;e parties contend: even the barbarous invader leaves untouched the commercial &s;ettle|ment which has not provoked his rage: though ma&s;ter of opulent cities, he only incamps in their neighbourhood, and leaves to his heirs the option of entering, by degrees, on the plea&s;ures, the vi|ces, and the pageantries his acqui&s;itions afford: his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;till more than him&s;elf, are di&s;po&s;ed to fo&s;ter the hive, in proportion as they ta&s;te more of its &s;weets; and they &s;pare the inhabitant, together with his dwelling, as they &s;pare the herd or the &s;tall, of which they are be|come the proprietors.</P>
<P>THE modern de&s;cription of India is a repeti|tion of the ancient, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of China is derived from a di&s;tant antiquity, to which there is no parallel in the hi&s;tory of mankind. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of monarchs has been changed; but no revolutions have affected the &s;tate. The African and the Samoiede are not more uniform in their ig|norance and barbarity, than the Chine&s;e and the In|dian, if we may credit their own &s;tory, have been in the practice of manufacture, and in the ob&s;er+vance of a certain police, which was calculated only to regulate their traffic, and to protect them in their application to &s;ervile or lucrative arts.</P>
<P>IF we pa&s;s from the&s;e general repre&s;entations of what mankind have done, to the more minute de&s;cription of the animal him&s;elf, as he has occu|pied different climates, and is diver&s;ified in his tem|per, complexion, and character, we &s;hall find a variety of genius corre&s;ponding to the effects of his conduct, and the re&s;ult of his &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="173">
MAN, in the perfection of his natural faculties, is quick and delicate in his &s;en&s;ibility; exten&s;ive and various in his imaginations and reflections; at|tentive, penetrating, and &s;ubtile, in what relates to his fellow-creatures; firm and ardent in his purpo&s;es; devoted to friend&s;hip or to enmity; jealous of his independence and his honour, which he will not relinqui&s;h for &s;afety or for profit: un|der all his corruptions or improvements, he retains his natural &s;en&s;ibility, if not his force; and his commerce is a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e, according to the direction his mind has received.</P>
<P>BUT under the extremes of heat or of cold, the active range of the human &s;oul appears to be limited; and men are of inferior importance, either as friends, or as enemies. In the one ex|treme, they are dull and &s;low, moderate in their de&s;ires, regular and pacific in their manner of life; in the other, they are feveri&s;h in their pa&s;&s;ions, weak in their judgements, and addicted by tem|perament to animal plea&s;ure. In both the heart is mercenary, and makes important conce&s;&s;ions for childi&s;h bribes; in both the &s;pirit is prepared for &s;ervitude: in the one it is &s;ubdued by fear of the future; in the other it is not rou&s;ed even by its &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE nations of Europe who would &s;ettle or conquer on the &s;outh or the north of their own hap|pier climates, find little re&s;i&s;tance: they extend their dominion at plea&s;ure, and find no where a li|mit but in the ocean, and in the &s;atiety of conque&s;t.

<P>IT appears, however, that on the &s;hores of the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, they have met with nations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tchutzi.</NOTE> who have que&s;tioned their title to reign, and who have con&s;idered the requi&s;ition of a tax as the demand of effects for nothing. Here perhaps may be found the genius of ancient Europe, and under its name of ferocity, the &s;pirit of national indepen|dence<NOTE PLACE="foot" N="&Dagger;">Notes to the Genealogical Hi&s;tory of the Tartars.</NOTE>; that &s;pirit which di&s;puted its ground in the We&s;t with the victorious armies of Rome, and baffled the attempts of the Per&s;ian monarchs to comprehend the villages of Greece within the bounds of their exten&s;ive dominion.</P>

like the animal for who&s;e race his country is famed, whether wild in the woods, or tutored by art, is lively, active, and fervent in the exerci&s;e on which he is bent.

When rou&s;ed by the pro&s;pect of conque&s;t, or di&s;po&s;ed to act on a plan, they &s;pread their dominion, and their &s;y&s;tem of ima|gination, over mighty tracts of the earth: when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property and of &s;ettlement, they &s;et the example of a lively invention, and &s;uperior in|genuity, in the practice of arts, and the &s;tudy of &s;cience. The Laplander, on the contrary, like the a&s;&s;ociate of his climate, is hardy, indefatigable, and patient of famine; dull rather than tame; &s;erviceable in a particular tract; and incapable of change. Whole nations continue from age to age in the &s;ame condition, and, with immoveable phlegm, &s;ubmit to the appellations of <HI>Dane,</HI> of <HI>Swede,</HI> or of <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> according to the land they inhabit; and &s;uffer their country to be &s;evered like a common, by the line on which tho&s;e nations have traced their limits of empire.</P>
<P>IT is not in the extremes alone that the&s;e va|rieties of genius may be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed. Their continual change keeps pace with the vari|ations of climate with which we &s;uppo&s;e them connected: and though certain degrees of capa|city, penetration, and ardour, are not the lot of entire nations, nor the vulgar properties of any

<P>IT is to the Southern nations of Europe, both ancient and modern, that we owe the invention and the embelli&s;hment of that mythology, and tho&s;e early traditions, which continue to furni&s;h the materials of fancy, and the field of poetic al|lu&s;ion. To them we owe the romantic tales of chivalry, as well as the &s;ub&s;equent models of a more rational &s;tyle, by which the heart and the imagi|nation are kindled, and the under&s;tanding in|formed</P>
<P>THE fruits of indu&s;try have abounded mo&s;t in the North, and the &s;tudy of &s;cience has here re|ceived its mo&s;t &s;olid improvements: the efforts of imagination and &s;entiment were mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in the South. While the &s;hores of the Baltic became famed for the &s;tudies of Co|pernicus, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler, tho&s;e of the Mediterranean were celebrated for giving birth to men of genius in all its variety, and for having abounded with poets and hi&s;torians, as well as with men of &s;cience.</P>
<P>ON one &s;ide, learning took its ri&s;e from the heart and the fancy; on the other, it is &s;till con|fined to the judgement and the memory. A faith|ful detail of public tran&s;actions, with little di&s;|cernment of their comparative importance; the treaties and the claims of nations, the births and genealogies of princes, are, in the literature of

Northern nations, amply pre&s;erved; while the lights of the under&s;tanding, and the feelings of the heart, are &s;uffered to peri&s;h. The hi&s;tory of the human character; the intere&s;ting memoir, found|ed no le&s;s on the carele&s;s proceedings of a private life, than on the formal tran&s;actions of a public &s;tation; the ingenious plea&s;antry, the piercing ri|dicule, the tender, pathetic, or the elevated &s;train of elocution, have been confined in modern as well as ancient times, with a few exceptions, to the &s;ame latitudes with the fig and the vine.</P>
<P>THESE diver&s;ities of natural genius, if real, mu&s;t have great part of their foundation in the animal frame: and it has been often ob&s;erved, that the vine flouri&s;hes, where, to quicken the fer|ments of the human blood, its aids are the lea&s;t required. While &s;piritous liquors are, among Southern nations, from a &s;en&s;e of their ruinous effects, prohibited; or from a love of decency, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a temperament &s;ufficiently warm, not greatly de&s;ired; they carry in the North a peculiar charm, while they awaken the mind, and give a ta&s;te of that lively fancy and ardour of pa&s;&s;ion, which the climate is found to deny.</P>
<P>THE melting de&s;ires, or the fiery pa&s;&s;ions, which in one climate take place between the &s;exes, are in another changed into a &s;ober con&s;ide|ration, or a patience of mutual di&s;gu&s;t. This change is remarked in cro&s;&s;ing the Mediterranean, in following the cour&s;e of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, in a&s;cend|ing the mountains of Cauca&s;us, and in pa&s;&s;ing from the Alps and the Pyrenees to the &s;hores of the Baltic.</P>

As it departs from the &s;un, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion is farther compo&s;ed into a habit of dome&s;tic connection, or frozen into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, under which the &s;exes at freedom &s;carcely chu&s;e to unite their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THESE variations of temperament and cha|racter, do not indeed corre&s;pond with the number

of degrees that are mea&s;ured from the equator to the pole; nor does the temperature of the air it|&s;elf depend on the latitude. Varieties of &s;oil and po&s;ition, the di&s;tance or neighbourhood of the &s;ea, are known to affect the atmo&s;phere, and may have &s;ignal effects in compo&s;ing the animal frame.</P>
<P>THE climates of America, though taken un|der the &s;ame parallel, are ob&s;erved to differ from tho&s;e of Europe. There, exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, great lakes, aged, decayed, and crouded fore&s;ts, with the other circum&s;tances that mark an uncultivated country, are &s;uppo&s;ed to repleni&s;h the air with heavy and noxious vapours, that give a double a&s;|perity to the winter, and, during many months, by the frequency and continuance of fogs, &s;now, and fro&s;t, carry the inconveniencies of the frigid zone far into the temperate. The Samoiede and the Laplander, however, have their counterpart, though on a lower latitude, on the &s;hores of Ame|rica: the Canadian and the Iroquois bear a re|&s;emblance to the ancient inhabitants of the mid|dling climates of Europe: the Mexican, like the A&s;iatic of India, being addicted to plea&s;ure, was &s;unk in effeminacy; and in the neighbourhood of the wild and the free, had &s;uffered to be rai&s;ed on his weakne&s;s, a domineering &s;uper&s;tition, and a permanent fabric of de&s;potical government.</P>
<P>GREAT part of Tartary lies under the &s;ame parallels with Greece, Italy, and Spain; but the climates are found to be different; and while the &s;hores, not only of the Mediterranean, but even tho&s;e of the Atlantic, are favoured with a moderate

change and vici&s;&s;itude of &s;ea&s;ons, the ea&s;tern parts of Europe, and the northern continent of A&s;ia, are afflicted with all their extremes. In one &s;ea|&s;on, we are told, that the plagues of an ardent &s;ummer reach almo&s;t to the frozen &s;ea; and that the inhabitant is obliged to &s;creen him&s;elf from noxious vermin in the &s;ame clouds of &s;moke in which he mu&s;t, at a different time of the year, take &s;helter from the rigours of cold, When winter returns, the tran&s;ition is rapid, and with an a&s;pe|rity almo&s;t equal in every latitude, lays wa&s;te the face of the earth, from the northern confines of Siberia, to the de&s;cents of Mount Cauca&s;us and the frontier of India.</P>
<P>WITH this unequal di&s;tribution of climate, by which the lot, as well as the national character, of the Northern A&s;iatic may be deemed inferior to that of Europeans who lie under the &s;ame parallels, a &s;imilar gradation of temperament and &s;pirit, however, has been ob&s;erved, in following the me|ridian on either tract; and the Southern Tartar has over the Tongu&s;es and the Samoiede, the &s;ame pre-eminence that certain nations of Europe are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s, over their Northern neighbours, in &s;ituations more advantageous to both.</P>
<P>THE Southern hemi&s;phere &s;carcely offers a &s;ub|ject of like ob&s;ervation.

<P>THAT the temper of the heart, and the in|tellectual operations of the mind, are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, dependent on the &s;tate of the animal organs, is well known from experience.

<P>AMONG the advantages which enable nations to run the carrier of policy, as well as of arts, it may be expected, from the ob&s;ervations already made, that we &s;hould reckon every circum&s;tance which enables them to divide and to maintain them&s;elves in di&s;tinct and in independent commu|nities. The &s;ociety and concour&s;e of other men, are not more nece&s;&s;ary to form the individual, than the rival&s;hip and competition of nations are to in|vigorate the principles of political life in a &s;tate. Their wars, and their treaties, their mutual jea|lou&s;ies, and the e&s;tabli&s;hments which they devi&s;e with a view to each other, con&s;titute more than half the occupations of mankind, and furni&s;h ma|terials for their greate&s;t and mo&s;t improving exer|tions. For this rea&s;on, clu&s;ters of i&s;lands, a con|tinent divided by many natural barriers, great rivers, ridges of mountains, and arms of the &s;ea, are be&s;t fitted for becoming the nur&s;ery of inde|pendent and re&s;pectable nations. The di&s;tinction of &s;tates being clearly maintained, a principle of political life is e&s;tabli&s;hed in every divi&s;ion, and the capital of every di&s;trict, like the heart in an animal body, communicates with ea&s;e the vital blood and the national &s;pirit to its members.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t re&s;pectable nations have always been found where at lea&s;t one part of the frontier has been wa&s;hed by the &s;ea.

<P>THRIVING and independent nations were ac|cordingly &s;cattered on the &s;hores of the Pacific and the Atlantic. They &s;urrounded the Red &s;ea, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic; while, a few tribes excepted, who retired among the mountains border|ing on India and Per&s;ia, or who have found &s;ome rude e&s;tabli&s;hment among the creeks and the &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian and the Euxine, there is &s;carcely a people in the va&s;t continent of A&s;ia who de&s;erves the name of a nation. The unbounded plain is traver&s;ed at large by hordes, who are in perpetual motion, or who are di&s;placed and harra&s;&s;ed by their mutual ho&s;tilities. Although they are never perhaps actually blended together in the cour&s;e of hunting, or in the &s;earch of pa&s;ture, they can|not bear one great di&s;tinction of nations, which is taken from the territory, and which is deeply impre&s;&s;ed by an affection to the native &s;eat. They move in troops, without the arrangement or the concert of nations; they become ea&s;y acce&s;&s;ions to every new empire among them&s;elves, or to the Chine&s;e and the Mu&s;covite, with whom they hold a traffic for the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the ma|terials of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHERE a happy &s;y&s;tem of nations is form|ed, they do not rely for the continuance of their &s;eparate names, and for that of their political in|dependence, on the barriers erected by nature.

<P>THE &s;avage, who&s;e fortune is compri&s;ed in his cabin, his fur, and his arms, is &s;atisfied with that provi&s;ion, and with that degree of &s;ecurity, he him&s;elf can procure. He perceives, in treating with his equal, no &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion that &s;hould be referred to the deci&s;ion of a judge; nor does he find in any hand the badges of magi&s;tracy, or the en&s;igns of a perpetual command.</P>
<P>THE barbarian, though induced by his admi|ration of per&s;onal qualities, the lu&s;tre of a heroic race, or a &s;uperiority of fortune, to follow the ban|ners of a leader, and to act a &s;ubordinate part in his tribe, knows not, that what he performs from choice, is to be made a &s;ubject of obligation. He acts from affections unacquainted with forms; and when provoked, or when engaged in di&s;putes,
<PB N="182" REF="188">
he recurs to the &s;word, as the ultimate means of deci&s;ion, in all que&s;tions of right.</P>
<P>HUMAN affairs, in the mean time, continue their progre&s;s. What was in one generation a propen&s;ity to herd with the &s;pecies, becomes, in the ages which follow, a principle of national uni|on. What was originally an alliance for common defence, becomes a concerted plan of political &s;orce; the care of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence becomes an anxiety for ac|cumulating wealth, and the foundation of com|mercial arts.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in following the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of their minds, in &s;triving to remove inconveniencies, or to gain apparent and contiguous advantages, arrive at ends which even their imagination could not anticipate, and pa&s;s on, like other animals, in the track of their nature, without perceiving its end. He who fir&s;t &s;aid,
<Q>I will appropriate this field; I will leave it to my heirs;</Q>
did not per|ceive, that he was laying the foundation of civil laws and political e&s;tabli&s;hments. He who fir&s;t ranged him&s;elf under a leader, did not perceive, that he was &s;etting the example of a permanent &s;ubordination, under the pretence of which, the rapacious were to &s;eize his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the ar|rogant to lay claim to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>MEN, in general, are &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to oc|cupy them&s;elves in forming projects and &s;chemes: but he who would &s;cheme and project for others, will find an opponent in every per&s;on who is di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;cheme for him&s;elf. Like the winds, that come we know not whence, and blow whi|ther&s;oever they li&s;t, the forms of &s;ociety are derived
<PB N="183" REF="189">
from an ob&s;cure and di&s;tant origin; they a|ri&s;e, long before the date of philo&s;ophy, from the in&s;tincts, not from the &s;peculations, of men. The croud of mankind, are directed in their e&s;tabli&s;h|ments and mea&s;ures, by the circum&s;tances in which they are placed; and &s;eldom are turned from their way, to follow the plan of any &s;ingle projector.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;tep and every movement of the mul|titude, even in what are termed enlightened ages, are made with equal blindne&s;s to the future; and nations &s;tumble upon e&s;tabli&s;hments, which are indeed the re&s;ult of human action, but not the execution of any human de&s;ign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Retz Memoirs.</NOTE>. If Crom|well &s;aid, That a man never mounts higher, than when he knows not whither he is going; it may with more rea&s;on be affirmed of communities, that they admit of the greate&s;t revolutions where no change is intended, and that the mo&s;t refined politicians do not always know whither they are leading the &s;tate by their projects.</P>
<P>IF we li&s;ten to the te&s;timony of modern hi&s;tory, and to that of the mo&s;t authentic parts of the an|cient; if we attend to the practice of nations in every quarter of the world, and in every condi|tion, whether that of the barbarian or the poli&s;h|ed, we &s;hall find very little rea&s;on to retract this a&s;&s;ertion. No con&s;titution is formed by concert, no government is copied from a plan. The mem|bers of a &s;mall &s;tate contend for equality; the members of a greater, find them&s;elves cla&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="184" REF="190">
a certain manner that lays a foundation for mo|narchy. They proceed from one form of govern|ment to another, by ea&s;y tran&s;itions, and fre|quently under old names adopt a new con&s;titution. The &s;eeds of every form are lodged in human na|ture; they &s;pring up and ripen with the &s;ea&s;on. The prevalence of a particular &s;pecies is often de|rived from an imperceptible ingredient mingled in the &s;oil.</P>
<P>WE are therefore to receive, with caution, the traditionary hi&s;tories of ancient legi&s;lators, and founders of &s;tates. Their names have long been celebrated; their &s;uppo&s;ed plans have been admir|ed; and what were probably the con&s;equences of an early &s;ituation, is, in every in&s;tance, con&s;ider|ed as an effect of de&s;ign. An author and a work, like cau&s;e and effect, are perpetually coupled to|gether. This is the &s;imple&s;t form under which we can con&s;ider the e&s;tabli&s;hment of nations: and we a&s;cribe to a previous de&s;ign, what came to be known only by experience, what no human wi&s;|dom could fore&s;ee, and what, without the con|curring humour and di&s;po&s;ition of his age, no authority could enable an individual to execute.</P>
<P>IF men during ages of exten&s;ive reflection, and employed in the &s;earch of improvement, are wedded to their in&s;titutions; and, labouring under many acknowledged inconveniencies, cannot break loo&s;e from the trammels of cu&s;tom; what &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e their humour to have been in the times of Romulus and Lycurgus? They were not &s;urely more di&s;po&s;ed to embrace the &s;chemes of inno|vators, or to &s;hake off the impre&s;&s;ions of habit: they were not more pliant and ductile, when their
<PB N="185" REF="191">
knowledge was le&s;s; not more capable of refine|ment, when their minds were more circum|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>WE imagine, perhaps, that rude nations mu&s;t have &s;o &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of the defects under which they labour, and be &s;o con&s;cious that reformations are requi&s;ire in their manners, that they mu&s;t be ready to adopt, with joy, every plan of improve|ment, and to receive every plau&s;ible propo&s;al with implicit compliance. And we are thus inclined to believe, that the harp of Orpheus could effect, in one age, what the eloquence of Plato could not produce in another. We mi&s;take, however, the characteri&s;tic of &s;imple ages: mankind then ap|pear to feel the fewe&s;t defects, and are then lea&s;t de&s;irous to enter on reformations.</P>
<P>THE reality, in the mean time, of certain e&s;tabli&s;hments at Rome and at Sparta, cannot be di&s;puted: but it is probable, that the government of both the&s;e &s;tates took its ri&s;e from the &s;itua|tion and genius of the people, not from the pro|jects of &s;ingle men; that the celebrated warrior and &s;tate&s;man, who are con&s;idered as the found|ers of tho&s;e nations, only acted a &s;uperior part among numbers who were di&s;po&s;ed to the &s;ame in&s;titutions; and that they left to po&s;terity a re|nown, pointing them out as the inventors of many practices which had been already in u&s;e, and which helped to form their own manners and genius, as well as tho&s;e of their countrymen.</P>
<P>IT has been formerly ob&s;erved, that, in many particulars, the cu&s;toms of &s;imple nations coincide with what is a&s;cribed to the invention of early
<PB N="186" REF="192">
&s;tate&s;men; that the model of republican go|vernment, the &s;enate, and the a&s;&s;embly of the peo|ple; that even the equality of property, or the community of goods, were not re&s;erved to the invention or contrivance of &s;ingular men.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider Romulus as the founder of the Roman &s;tate, certainly he who killed his brother that he might reign alone, did not de&s;ire to come under re&s;traints from the controuling power of the &s;enate, nor to refer the councils of his &s;overeignty to the deci&s;ion of a collective body. Love of do|minion is, by its nature, aver&s;e to con&s;traint; and this chieftain, like every leader in a rude age, probably found a cla&s;s of men ready to intrude on his councils, and without whom he could not proceed. He met with occa&s;ions, on which, as at the &s;ound of a trumpet, the body of the peo|ple a&s;&s;embled, and took re&s;olutions, which any in|dividual might in vain di&s;pute, or attempt to con|troul; and Rome, which commenced on the ge|neral plan of every artle&s;s &s;ociety, found la&s;ting improvements in the pur&s;uit of temporary expe|dients, and dige&s;ted her political frame in adju&s;t|ing the preten&s;ions of parties which aro&s;e in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>MANKIND, in very early ages of &s;ociety, learn to covet riches, and to admire di&s;tinction: they have avarice and ambition, and are occa&s;ionally led by them to depredation and conque&s;t: but in their ordinary conduct, the&s;e motives are balan|ced or re&s;trained by other habits and other pur|&s;uits; by &s;loth, or intemperance; by per&s;onal at|tachments, or per&s;onal animo&s;ities; which mi&s;lead from the attention to intere&s;t. The&s;e circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="187" REF="193">
render mankind, at times, remi&s;s or outra|geous: they prove the &s;ource of civil peace or di&s;|order, but di&s;qualify tho&s;e who are actuated by them, from maintaining any fixed u&s;urpation; &s;lavery and rapine are fir&s;t threatened from abroad, and war, either offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of every tribe. The enemy occupy their thoughts; they have no lei&s;ure for dome&s;tic di&s;|&s;en&s;ions. It is the de&s;ire of every &s;eparate commu|nity, however, to &s;ecure it&s;elf; and in proportion as it gains this object, by &s;trengthening its barri|er, by weakening its enemy, or by procuring al|lies, the individual at home bethinks him of what he may gain or lo&s;e for him&s;elf: the leader is di&s;po&s;ed to enlarge the advantages which belong to his &s;tation; the follower becomes jealous of rights which are open to incroachment; and par|ties who united before, from affection and habit, or from a regard to their common pre&s;ervation, di&s;|agree in &s;upporting their &s;everal claims to prece|cedence or profit.</P>
<P>WHEN the animo&s;ities of faction are thus a|wakened at home, and the preten&s;ions of freedom are oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e of dominion, the members of every &s;ociety find a new &s;cene upon which to ex|ert their activity. They had quarrelled, perhaps, on points of intere&s;t; they had balanced between different leaders; but they had never united as ci|tizens to with&s;tand the encroachments of &s;overeign|ty, or to maintain their common rights as a peo|ple. If the prince, in this conte&s;t, finds numbers to &s;upport, as well as to oppo&s;e his preten&s;ions, the &s;word which was whetted again&s;t foreign ene|mies, may be pointed at the bo&s;om of fellow|&s;ubjects, and every interval of peace from abroad,
<PB N="188" REF="194">
be filled with dome&s;tic war. The &s;acred names of Liberty, Ju&s;tice, and Civil Order, are made to re|&s;ound in public a&s;&s;emblies; and, during the ab|&s;ence of other alarms, give to &s;ociety, within it|&s;elf, an abundant &s;ubject of ferment and animo|&s;ity.</P>
<P>IF what is related of the little principalities which, in ancient times, were formed in Greece, in Italy, and over all Europe, agrees with the cha|racter we have given of mankind under the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of property, of intere&s;t, and of he|reditary di&s;tinctions, the &s;editions and dome&s;tic wars which followed in tho&s;e very &s;tates, the ex|pul&s;ion of their kings, or the que&s;tions which aro&s;e concerning the prerogatives of the &s;overeign, or privilege of the &s;ubject, are agreeable to the re|pre&s;entation which we now give of the fir&s;t &s;tep toward political e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the de&s;ire of a legal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>WHAT this con&s;titution may be in its ear|lie&s;t form, depends on a variety of circum&s;tan|ces in the condition of nations: It depends on the extent of the principality in its rude &s;tate; on the degree of di&s;parity to which mankind had &s;ubmitted before they began to di&s;pute its abu&s;es: it depends likewi&s;e on what we term <HI>accidents,</HI> the per&s;onal character of an individual, or the events of a war.</P>
<P>EVERY community is originally a &s;mall one. That propen&s;ity by which mankind at fir&s;t unite, is not the principle from which they afterwards act in extending the limits of empire. Small tribes, where they are not a&s;&s;embled by common objects
<PB N="189" REF="195">
of conque&s;t or &s;afety, are even aver&s;e to a coali|tion. If, like the real or fabulous confederacy of the Greeks for the de&s;truction of Troy, many na|tions combine in pur&s;uit of a &s;ingle object, they ea&s;ily &s;eparate again, and act anew on the maxims of rival &s;tates.</P>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, a certain national extent, within which the pa&s;&s;ions of men are ea&s;ily com|municated from one, or a few, to the whole; and there are certain numbers of men who can be a&s;|&s;embled, and act in a body. If, while the &s;ociety is not enlarged beyond this dimen&s;ion, and while its members are ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled, political conten|tions ari&s;e, the &s;tate &s;eldom fails to proceed on republican maxims, and to e&s;tabli&s;h democracy. In mo&s;t rude principalities, the leader derived his prerogative from the lu&s;tre of his race, and from the voluntary attachment of his tribe: the peo|ple he commanded, were his friends, his &s;ubjects and his troops. If we &s;uppo&s;e, upon any change in their manners, that they cea&s;e to revere his dig|nity, that they pretend to equality among them|&s;elves, or are &s;eized with a jealou&s;y of his a&s;&s;uming too much, the foundations of his power are already withdrawn. When the voluntary &s;ubject becomes refractory; when con&s;iderable parties, or the col|lective body, chu&s;e to act for them&s;elves; the &s;mall kingdom, like that of Athens, becomes of cour&s;e a republic.</P>
<P>THE changes of condition, and of manners, which, in the progre&s;s of mankind, rai&s;e up to nations a leader and a prince, create, at the &s;ame time, a nobility, and a variety of ranks, who have, in a &s;ubordinate degree, their claim to di&s;tinction.
<PB N="190" REF="196">
Super&s;tition, too, may create an order of men, who, under the title of prie&s;thood, engage in the pur&s;uit of a &s;eparate intere&s;t; who, by their uni|on and firmne&s;s as a body, and by their ince&s;&s;ant ambition, de&s;erve to be reckoned in the li&s;t of pre|tenders to power. The&s;e different orders of men are the elements of who&s;e mixture the political body is generally formed; each draws to its &s;ide &s;ome part from the ma&s;s of the people. The peo|ple them&s;elves are a party upon occa&s;ion; and numbers of men, however cla&s;&s;ed and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, become, by their jarring preten&s;ions and &s;e|parate views, mutual interruptions and checks; and have, by bringing to the national councils the maxims and apprehen&s;ions of a particular order, and by guarding a particular intere&s;t, a &s;hare in adju&s;ting or pre&s;erving the political form of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE preten&s;ions of any particular order, if not checked by &s;ome collateral power, would termin|ate in tyranny; tho&s;e of a prince, in de&s;poti&s;m; tho&s;e of a nobility or prie&s;thood, in the abu&s;es of ari&s;tocracy; of a populace, in the confu&s;ions of anarchy. The&s;e terminations, as they are never the profe&s;&s;ed, &s;o are they &s;eldom even the di&s;gui&s;ed, object of party: but the mea&s;ures which any par|ty pur&s;ues, if &s;uffered to prevail, will lead, by de|grees, to every extreme.</P>
<P>IN their way to the a&s;cendant they endeavour to gain, and in the mid&s;t of interruptions which oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts mutually give, liberty may have a permanent or a tran&s;ient exi&s;tence; and the con|&s;titution may bear a form and a character as va|rious
<PB N="191" REF="197">
as the ca&s;ual combination of &s;uch multiplied parts can effect.</P>
<P>TO be&s;tow on communities &s;ome degree of political freedom, it is perhaps &s;ufficient, that their members, either &s;ingly, or as they are involved with their &s;everal orders, &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on their rights; that under republics, the citizen &s;hould either maintain his own equality with firmne&s;s, or re&s;train the ambition of his fellow-citizen within moderate bounds: that under monarchy, men of every rank &s;hould maintain the honours of their private or their public &s;tations; and &s;acrifice, nei|ther to the impo&s;itions of a court, nor to the claims of a populace, tho&s;e dignities which are de&s;tined, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, independent of fortune, to give &s;tability to the throne, and to procure a re&s;pect to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>AMIDST the contentions of party, the intere&s;ts of the public, even the maxims of ju&s;tice and can|dour, are &s;ometimes forgotten; and yet tho&s;e fa|tal con&s;equences which &s;uch a mea&s;ure of corrup|tion &s;eems to portend, do not unavoidably follow. The public intere&s;t is often &s;ecure, not becau&s;e in|dividuals are di&s;po&s;ed to regard it as the end of their conduct, but becau&s;e each, in his place, is determined to pre&s;erve his own. Liberty is main|tained by the continued differences and oppo&s;iti|ons of numbers, not by their concurring zeal in behalf of equitable government. In free &s;tates, therefore, the wi&s;e&s;t laws are never, perhaps, dic|tated by the intere&s;t and &s;pirit of any order of men: they are moved, they are oppo&s;ed, or amend|ed, by different hands; and come at la&s;t to ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="192" REF="198">
that medium and compo&s;ition which contend|ing parties have forced one another to adopt.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the hi&s;tory of mankind in this view, we cannot be at a lo&s;s for the cau&s;es which, in &s;mall communities, threw the balance on the &s;ide of democracy; which, in &s;tates more enlarged in re&s;pect to territory and numbers of people, gave the a&s;cendant to monarchy; and which, in a variety of conditions and of different ages, enabled mankind to blend and unite the characters of different forms; and, in&s;tead of any of the &s;imple con&s;titutions we have mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. &s;ect. 10.</NOTE>, to exhibit a medly of all.</P>
<P>IN emerging from a &s;tate of rudene&s;s and &s;im|plicity, men mu&s;t be expected to act from that &s;pirit of equality, or moderate &s;ubordination, to which they have been accu&s;tomed. When crouded together in cities, or within the compa&s;s of a &s;mall territory, they act by contagious pa&s;&s;ions, and e|very individual feels a degree of importance pro|portioned to his figure in the croud, and the &s;mall|ne&s;s of its numbers. The pretenders to power and dominion appear in too familiar a light to impo&s;e upon the multitude, and they have no aids at their call, by which they can bridle the refractory hu|mours of a people who re&s;i&s;t their preten&s;ions. The&s;eus, King of Attica, we are told, a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants of its twelve cantons into one city. In this he took an effectual method to unite into one democracy, what were before the &s;eparate members of his monarchy, and to ha&s;ten the downfal of the regal power.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199">
THE monarch of an exten&s;ive territory has many advantages in maintaining his &s;tation. Without any grievance to his &s;ubjects, he can &s;upport the magnificence of a royal e&s;tate, and dazzle the imagination of his people, by that very wealth which them&s;elves have be&s;towed. He can employ the inhabitants of one di&s;trict again&s;t tho&s;e of another; and while the pa&s;&s;ions that lead to mutiny and rebellion, can at any one time &s;eize only on a part of his &s;ubjects, he feels him&s;elf &s;trong in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a general authority. Even the di&s;tance at which he re&s;ides from many of tho&s;e who receive his commands, augments the my&s;terious awe and re&s;pect which are paid to his government.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e different tendencies, accident and corruption, however, joined to a variety of circum&s;tances, may throw particular &s;tates from their bias, and produce exceptions to every gene|ral rule. This has actually happened in &s;ome of the later principalities of Greece, and modern Italy, in Sweden, Poland, and the German em|pire. But the united &s;tates of the Netherlands, and the Swi&s;s cantons, are perhaps the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive communities, which maintaining the union of nations, have, for any con&s;iderable time, re&s;i&s;ted the tendency to monarchical government; and Sweden is the only in&s;tance of a republic e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in a great kingdom on the ruins of monarchy.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign of a petty di&s;trict, or a &s;ingle city, when not &s;upported, as in modern Europe, by the contagion of monarchical manners, holds the &s;ceptre by a precarious tenure, and is perpe|tually
<PB N="194" REF="200">
alarmed by the &s;pirit of mutiny in his peo|ple, is guided by jealou&s;y, and &s;upports him&s;elf by &s;everity, prevention, and force.</P>
<P>THE popular and ari&s;tocratical powers in a great nation, as in the ca&s;e of Germany and Po|land, may meet with equal difficulty in maintain|ing their preten&s;ions; and in order to avoid their danger on the &s;ide of kingly u&s;urpation, are obliged to with-hold from the &s;upreme magi&s;trate even the nece&s;&s;ary tru&s;t of an executive power.</P>
<P>THE &s;tates of Europe, in the manner of their fir&s;t &s;ettlement, laid the foundations of monarchy, and were prepared to unite under regular and ex|ten&s;ive governments. If the Greeks, who&s;e pro|gre&s;s at home terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;o many independent republics, had under Aga|memnon effected a conque&s;t and &s;ettlement in A&s;ia, it is propable, that they might have fur|ni&s;hed an example of the &s;ame kind. But the original inhabitants of any country, forming many &s;eparate cantons, come by &s;low degrees to that coalition and union into which conquering tribes are, in effecting their conque&s;ts, or in &s;ecuring their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, hurried at once. Cae&s;ar encoun|tered &s;ome hundreds of independent nations in Gaul, whom even their common danger did not &s;ufficiently unite. The German invaders, who &s;ettled in the lands of the Romans, made, in the &s;ame di&s;trict, a number of &s;eparate e&s;tabli&s;hments, but far more exten&s;ive than what the ancient Gauls, by their conjunctions and treaties, or in the re&s;ult of their wars, could after many ages have reached.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="201">
THE &s;eeds of great monarchies, and the roots of exten&s;ive dominion, were every where planted with the colonies that divided the Roman empire. We have no exact account of the numbers, who, with a &s;eeming concert, continued, during &s;ome ages, to invade and to &s;eize this tempting prize. Where they expected re&s;i&s;tance, they endeavoured to mu&s;ter up a proportionable force; and when they propo&s;ed to &s;ettle, entire nations removed to &s;hare in the &s;poil. Scattered over an exten&s;ive province, where they could not be &s;ecure, with|out maintaining their union, they continued to acknowledge the leader under whom they had fought; and, like an army &s;ent by divi&s;ions into &s;eparate &s;tations, were prepared to a&s;&s;emble when|ever occa&s;ion &s;hould require their united operations or coun&s;els.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;eparate party had its po&s;t a&s;&s;igned, and every &s;ubordinate chieftain his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, from which he was to provide his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that of his followers. The model of government was taken from that of a military &s;ubordination, and a fief was the temporary pay of an officer proportioned to his rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Robert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Scotland, b. 1.</NOTE>. There was a cla&s;s of the people de&s;tined to military &s;ervice, another to labour, and to cultivate lands for the benefit of their ma&s;ters. The officer improved his tenure by degrees, fir&s;t changing a temporary grant into a tenure for his life; and this al&s;o, upon the ob&s;er|vance of certain conditions, into a grant including his heirs.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">
THE rank of the nobles became hereditary in every quarter, and formed a powerful and perma|nent order of men in every &s;tate. While they held the people in &s;ervitude, they di&s;puted the claims of their &s;overeign; they withdrew their at|tendance upon occa&s;ion, or turned their arms a|gain&s;t him. They formed a &s;trong and in&s;ur|mountable barrier again&s;t a general de&s;poti&s;m in the &s;tate; but they were them&s;elves, by means of their warlike retainers, the tyrants of every little di&s;trict, and prevented the e&s;tabli&s;hment of order, or any regular applications of law. They took the advantage of weak reigns or minorities, to pu&s;h their incroachments on the &s;overeign; or having made the monarchy elective, they by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive treaties and &s;tipulations, at every election, limited or undermined the monarchical power. The prerogatives of the prince have been, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as in that of the German empire in particular, reduced to a mere title; and the na|tional union it&s;elf pre&s;erved in the ob&s;ervance only of a few in&s;ignificant formalities.</P>
<P>WHERE the conte&s;t of the &s;overeign, and of his va&s;&s;als, under hereditary and ample preroga|tives annexed to the crown, had a different i&s;&s;ue, the feudal lord&s;hips were gradually &s;tript of their powers, the nobles were reduced to the &s;tate of &s;ubjects, and obliged to hold their honours, and exerci&s;e their juri&s;dictions, in a dependence on the prince. It was his &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t to reduce them to a &s;tate of equal &s;ubjection with the peo|ple, and to extend his own authority, by re&s;cuing the labourer and the dependent from the oppre&s;&s;ions of their immediate &s;uperiors.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="203">
IN this project the princes of Europe have va|riou&s;ly &s;ucceeded. While they protected the peo|ple, and thereby encouraged the practice of com|mercial and lucrative arts, they paved the way for de&s;poti&s;m in the &s;tate; and with the &s;ame policy by which they relieved the &s;ubject from many op|pre&s;&s;ions, they increa&s;ed the powers of the crown.</P>
<P>BUT where the people had by the con&s;titution a repre&s;entative in the government, and a head, under which they could avail them&s;elves of the wealth they acquired, and of the &s;en&s;e of their per&s;onal importance, this policy turned again&s;t the crown; it formed a new power to re&s;train the pre|rogative, to e&s;tabli&s;h the government of law, and to exhibit a &s;pectacle new in the hi&s;tory of man|kind; monarchy mixed with republic, and exten|&s;ive territory, governed, during &s;ome ages, with|out military force.</P>
<P>SUCH were the &s;teps by which the nations of Europe have arrived at their pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ments: in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of legal con&s;titutions; in others, to the exerci&s;e of a mitigated de&s;poti&s;m; or continue to &s;truggle with the tendency which they &s;everally have to the&s;e different extremes.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of empire, in the early ages of Europe, threatened to be rapid, and to bury the independent &s;pirit of nations in that grave which the Ottoman conquerors found for them&s;elves; and for the wretched race they had vanqui&s;hed. The Romans were led by &s;low degrees to extend the limits of their empire; every new acqui&s;ition
<PB N="198" REF="204">
was the re&s;ult of a tedious war, and required the &s;ending of colonies, and a variety of mea&s;ures, to &s;ecure any new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But the feudal &s;upe|rior being animated, from the moment he had gained an e&s;tabli&s;hment, with a de&s;ire of extend|ing his territory, and of enlarging the li&s;t of his va&s;&s;als, made frequent annexation of new provin|ces, merely by be&s;towing inve&s;titure, and received independent &s;tates, without any material innova|tion in the form of their policy, as the &s;ubjects of his growing dominion.</P>
<P>SEPARATE principalities were, like the parts of an engine, ready to be joined, and, like the materials of a building, ready to be erected. They were in the re&s;ult of their &s;truggles put together or taken a&s;under with facility. The independence of weak &s;tates was pre&s;erved only by the mutual jealou&s;ies of the &s;trong, or by the general attention of all to maintain a balance of power.</P>
<P>THE happy &s;y&s;tem of policy on which Euro|pean &s;tates have proceeded in pre&s;erving this balance; the degree of moderation which is, in adju&s;ting their treaties, become habitual even to victorious and powerful monarchies, does honour to mankind, and may give hopes of a la&s;ting felicity to be derived from a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, never, perhaps, equally &s;trong in any former period, or among any number of na|tions, that the fir&s;t conquering people will ruin them&s;elves, as well as their rivals.</P>
<P>IT is in &s;uch &s;tates, perhaps, as in a fabric of a large dimen&s;ion, that we can perceive mo&s;t di&s;tinctly the &s;everal parts of which a political

The &s;malle&s;t repub|lics, however; con&s;i&s;t of parts &s;imilar to the&s;e, and of members who are actuated by a &s;imilar &s;pirit. They furni&s;h examples of government diver&s;ified by the ca&s;ual combinations of parties, and by the different advantages with which tho&s;e parties en|gage in the conflict.</P>
<P>IN every &s;ociety there is a ca&s;ual &s;ubordina|tion, independent of its formal e&s;tabli&s;hment, and frequently adver&s;e to its con&s;titution. While the admini&s;tration and the people &s;peak the language of a particular form, and &s;eem to admit no pre|ten&s;ions to power, without a legal nomination in one in&s;tance, or without the advantage of here|ditary honours, in another, this ca&s;ual &s;ubordina|tion, po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;ing from the di&s;tribution of pro|perty, or from &s;ome other circum&s;tance that be|&s;tows unequal degrees of influence, gives the &s;tate its tone, and fixes its character.</P>
<P>THE plebeian order at Rome having been long con&s;idered as of an inferior condition, and excluded from the higher offices of magi&s;tracy, had &s;uffi|cient force, as a body, to get this invidious di|&s;tinction removed; but the individual &s;till acting under the impre&s;&s;ions of a &s;ubordinate rank, gave in every competition his &s;uffrage to a patrician, who&s;e protection he had experienced, and who&s;e per&s;onal authority he felt. By this means, the a&s;cendency of the patrician families was, for a certain period; as regular as it could be made by the avowed maxims of ari&s;to|cracy;
<PB N="200" REF="206">
but the higher offices of &s;tate being gra|dually &s;hared by plebeians, the effects of former di&s;tinctions were prevented or weakened. The laws that were made to adju&s;t the preten&s;ions of different orders were ea&s;ily eluded. The populace became a faction, and their alliance was the &s;ure&s;t road to dominion. Clodius, by a pretended a|doption into a plebeian family, was qualified to become tribune of the people; and Cae&s;ar, by e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of this faction, made his way to u&s;urpation and tyranny.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch fleeting and tran&s;ient &s;cenes, forms of government are only modes of proceeding, in which every &s;ub&s;equent age may differ from the former. Faction is ever ready to &s;eize all occa|&s;ional advantages; and mankind, when in hazard from any party, &s;eldom find a better protection than that of its rival. Cato united with Pompey in oppo&s;ition to Cae&s;ar, and guarded again&s;t no|thing &s;o much as that reconciliation of parties, which was in effect to be a combination of different leaders again&s;t the freedom of the republic. This illu&s;trious per&s;onage &s;tood di&s;tingui&s;hed in his age like a man among children, and was rai&s;ed above his opponents, as much by the ju&s;tne&s;s of his un|der&s;tanding, and the extent of his penetration, as he was by the manly fortitude and di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s with which he &s;trove to baffle the de&s;igns of a vain and childi&s;h ambition, that was operating to the ruin of mankind.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH free con&s;titutions of government &s;eldom or never take their ri&s;e from the &s;cheme of any &s;ingle projector, yet are they often pre&s;erved by the vigilance, activity, and zeal, of &s;ingle men. Hap|py are they who under&s;tand and who chu&s;e this

object of care; and happy it is for mankind when it is not cho&s;en too late. It has been re&s;erved to &s;ignalize the lives of a Cato or a Brutus, on the eve of fatal revolutions; to fo&s;ter in &s;ecret the in|dignation of Thra&s;ea and Helvidius; and to oc|cupy the reflections of &s;peculative men in times of corruption. But even in &s;uch late and ineffectual examples, it was happy to know, and to value, an object which is &s;o important to mankind.

<HEAD>Of National Objects in general, and of E&s;tabli&s;h|ments and Manners relating to them.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the mode of &s;ubordination is ca&s;ual, and forms of government take their ri&s;e, chiefly from the manner in which the members of a &s;tate have been originally cla&s;&s;ed, and from a variety of circum&s;tances that procure to particular orders of men a &s;way in their country, there are certain objects that claim the attention of every government, that lead the apprehen&s;ions and the rea&s;onings of mankind in every &s;ociety, and that not only furni&s;h an employment to &s;tate&s;men, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure direct the community to tho&s;e in&s;titutions, under the authority of which the ma|gi&s;trate holds his power. Such are the national defence, the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, the pre&s;er|vation and internal pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. If the&s;e objects be neglected, we mu&s;t apprehend that the very &s;cene in which parties contend for power, for privilege, or equality, mu&s;t di&s;appear, and &s;ociety it&s;elf no longer exi&s;t</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration due to the&s;e objects will be pleaded in every public a&s;&s;embly, and will pro|duce, in every political conte&s;t, appeals to that common &s;en&s;e and opinion of mankind, which, &s;truggling with the private views of individuals, and the claims of party, may be con&s;idered as the great legi&s;lator of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209">
THE mea&s;ures required for the attainment of mo&s;t national objects, are connected together, and mu&s;t be jointly pur&s;ued: they are often the &s;ame. The force which is prepared for defence again&s;t foreign enemies, may be likewi&s;e employed to keep the peace at home: the laws made to &s;ecure the rights and liberties of the people, may &s;erve as encouragements to population and commerce: and every community, without con&s;idering how its objects may be cla&s;&s;ed or di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;pecu|lative men, is, in every in&s;tance, obliged to a&s;|&s;ume or to retain that form which is be&s;t fitted to pre&s;erve its advantages, or to avert its misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>NATIONS, however, like private men, have their favourite ends, and their principal pur&s;uits, which diver&s;ify their manners, as well as their e&s;tabli&s;hments. They even attain to the &s;ame ends by different means; and, like men who make their fortune by different profe&s;&s;ions, retain the habits of their principal calling in every condi|tion at which they arrive. The Romans became wealthy in pur&s;uing their conque&s;ts; and proba|bly, for a certain period, increa&s;ed the numbers of mankind, while their di&s;po&s;ition to war &s;eemed to threaten the earth with de&s;olation. Some mo|dern nations proceed to dominion and enlargement on the maxims of commerce; and while they only intend to accumulate riches at home, continue to gain an imperial a&s;cendant abroad.</P>
<P>THE characters of the warlike and the com|mercial are variou&s;ly combined: they are formed in different degrees by the influence of circum|&s;tances
<PB N="204" REF="210">
that more or le&s;s frequently give ri&s;e to war, and excite the de&s;ire of conque&s;t; of cir|cum&s;tances that leave a people in quiet to improve their dome&s;tic re&s;ources, or to purcha&s;e, by the fruits of their indu&s;try, from foreigners, what their own &s;oil and their climate deny.</P>
<P>THE members of every community are more or le&s;s occupied with matters of &s;tate, in propor|tion as their con&s;titution admits them to a &s;hare in the government, and &s;ummons up their attention to objects of a public nature. A people are cul|tivated or unimproved in their talents, in propor|tion as tho&s;e talents are employed in the practice of arts, and in the affairs of &s;ociety: they are im|proved or corrupted in their manners, in propor|tion as they are encouraged and directed to act on the maxims of freedom and ju&s;tice, or as they are degraded into a &s;tate of meanne&s;s and &s;ervi|tude. But whatever advantages are obtained, or whatever evils are avoided, by nations, in any of the&s;e important re&s;pects, are generally con&s;idered as mere occa&s;ional incidents: they are &s;eldom ad|mitted among the objects of policy, or entered among the rea&s;ons of &s;tate.</P>
<P>WE hazard being treated with ridicule, when we require political e&s;tabli&s;hments, merely to cul|tivate the talents of men, and to in&s;pire the &s;en|timents of a liberal mind: we mu&s;t offer &s;ome motive of intere&s;t, or &s;ome hopes of external ad|vantage, to animate the pur&s;uits, or to direct the mea&s;ures, of ordinary men. They would be brave, ingenious, and eloquent, only from nece&s;|&s;ity, or for the &s;ake of profit: they magnify the

u&s;es of wealth, population, and the other re|&s;ources of war; but often forget that the&s;e are of no con&s;equence without the direction of able ca|pacities, and without the &s;upports of a national vigour. We may expect, therefore, to find among &s;tates the bias to a particular policy, taken from the regards to public &s;afety; from the de&s;ire of &s;ecuring per&s;onal freedom, or private property; &s;eldom from the con&s;ideration of moral effects, or from a view to the genius of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>Of Population and Wealth.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we imagine what the Romans mu&s;t have felt when the tidings came that the flower of their city had peri&s;hed at Cannae; when we think of what the orator had in his mind when he &s;aid, <Q>That the youth among the people was like the &s;pring among the &s;ea&s;ons;</Q> when we hear of the joy with which the hunt&s;man and the warrior is adopted, in America, to &s;u&s;tain the honours of the family and the nation; we are made to feel the mo&s;t powerful motives to regard the increa&s;e and pre&s;ervation of our fellow-citizens. Intere&s;t, affection, and views of policy, combine to recommend this object; and it is treated with entire neglect only by the tyrant who mi&s;takes his own advantage, by the &s;tate&s;man who trifles with the charge committed to his care, or by the peo|ple who are become corrupted, and who con&s;ider their fellow-&s;ubjects as rivals in intere&s;t, and com|petitors in their lucrative pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>AMONG rude &s;ocieties, and among &s;mall com|munities in general, who are engaged in frequent &s;truggles and difficulties, the pre&s;ervation and in|crea&s;e of their members is a mo&s;t important ob|ject. The American rates his defeat from the numbers of men he has lo&s;t, or he e&s;timates his victory from the pri&s;oners he has made; not from his having remained the ma&s;ter of a field, or from
<PB N="207" REF="213">
his being driven from a ground on which he en|countered his enemy. A man with whom he can a&s;&s;ociate in all his pur&s;uits, whom he can embrace as his friend; in whom he finds an object to his affections, and an aid in his &s;truggles, is to him the mo&s;t precious acce&s;&s;ion of fortune.</P>
<P>EVEN where the friend&s;hip of particular men is out of the que&s;tion, the &s;ociety, being occupied in forming a party that may defend it&s;elf, and an|noy its enemy, finds no object of greater moment than the increa&s;e of its numbers. Captives who may be adopted, or children of either &s;ex who may be reared for the public, are accordingly con&s;idered as the riche&s;t &s;poil of an enemy. The practice of the Romans in admitting the van|qui&s;hed to &s;hare in the privileges of their city, the rape of the Sabines, and the &s;ub&s;equent coali|tion with that people, were not &s;ingular or uncom|mon examples in the hi&s;tory of mankind. The &s;ame policy has been followed, and was natural and obvious where-ever the &s;trength of a &s;tate con|&s;i&s;ted in the arms of a few, and where men were valued in them&s;elves, di&s;tinct from the con&s;idera|tion of e&s;tate or of fortune.</P>
<P>IN rude ages, therefore, while mankind &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in &s;mall divi&s;ions, it &s;hould appear, that if the earth be thinly peopled, this defect does not ari&s;e from a di&s;regard to numbers on the part of &s;tates. It is even probable, that the mo&s;t effectual cour&s;e that could be taken to increa&s;e the &s;pecies, would be, to prevent the coalition of nations, and to oblige mankind to act in &s;uch &s;mall bodies as would make the pre&s;ervation of their numbers, a principal object of their care. This alone, it is
<PB N="208" REF="214">
true, would not be &s;ufficient: we mu&s;t probably add the encouragement for rearing families, which mankind enjoy under a favourable policy, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which they owe to the prac|tice of arts.</P>
<P>THE mother is unwilling to increa&s;e her off|&s;pring, and is ill provided to rear them, where &s;he her&s;elf is obliged to undergo great hard&s;hips in the &s;earch of her food. In North America, we are told, that &s;he joins to the re&s;erves of a cold or a moderate temperament, the ab&s;tinencies to which &s;he &s;ubmits from the con&s;ideration of this difficulty. In her apprehen&s;ion, it is matter of prudence, and of con&s;cience, to bring one child to the condition of feeding on veni&s;on, and of following on foot, before &s;he will hazard a new burden in travelling the woods.</P>
<P>IN warmer latitudes, by the different tempe|rament, perhaps, which the climate be&s;tows, and by a greater facility in procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the numbers of mankind increa&s;e, while the object it|&s;elf is neglected; and the commerce of the &s;exes, without any concern for population, is made a &s;ubject of mere debauch. In &s;ome places, we are told, it is even made the object of a barbarous policy, to defeat or to re&s;train the intentions of nature. In the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, the males are prohibited to marry before the age of forty; and females, if pregnant before the age of thirty-&s;ix, have an abortion procured by order of the magi|&s;trate, who employs a violence that endangers the life of the mother, together with that of the child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collection of Dutch voyages.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215">
IN China, the permi&s;&s;ion given to parents to kill or to expo&s;e their children, was probably meant as a relief from the burden of a numerous offspring. But notwith&s;tanding what we hear of a practice &s;o repugnant to the human heart, it has not, probably, the effects in re&s;training popula|tion, which it &s;eems to threaten; but, like many other in&s;titutions, has an influence the rever&s;e of what it &s;eemed to portend. The parents marry with this means of relief in their view, and the children are &s;aved.</P>
<P>HOWEVER important the object of population may be held by mankind, it will be difficult to find, in the hi&s;tory of civil policy, any wi&s;e or effectual e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;olely calculated to obtain it. The practice of rude or feeble nations is in|adequate, or cannot &s;urmount the ob&s;tacles which are found in their manner of life. The growth of indu&s;try, the endeavours of men to improve their arts, to extend their commerce, to &s;ecure their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to e&s;tabli&s;h their rights, are indeed the mo&s;t effectual means to promote po|pulation: but they ari&s;e from a different motive; they ari&s;e from regards to intere&s;t and per&s;onal &s;afety. They are intended for the benefit of tho&s;e who exi&s;t, not to procure the increa&s;e of their numbers.</P>
<P>IT is, in the mean time, of importance to know, that where a people are fortunate in their political e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur|&s;uits of indu&s;try, their population is likely to grow in proportion. Mo&s;t of the other devices thought of for this purpo&s;e, only &s;erve to fru&s;trate the
<PB N="210" REF="216">
expectations of mankind, or to mi&s;lead their at|tention.</P>
<P>IN planting a colony, in &s;triving to repair the occa&s;ional wa&s;tes of pe&s;tilence or war, the imme|diate contrivance of &s;tate&s;men may be u&s;eful; but if in rea&s;oning on the increa&s;e of mankind in ge|neral, we overlook their freedom, and their hap|pine&s;s, our aids to population become weak and ineffectual. They only lead us to work on the &s;urface, or to pur&s;ue a &s;hadow, while we neglect the &s;ub&s;tantial concern; and in a decaying &s;tate, make us tamper with palliatives, while the roots of an evil are &s;uffered to remain. Octavius revived or inforced the laws that related to population at Rome: but it may be &s;aid of him, and of many &s;overeigns in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, that they admi|ni&s;ter the poi&s;on, while they are devi&s;ing the re|medy; and bring a damp and a pal&s;y on the principles of life, while they endeavour, by exter|nal applications to the &s;kin, to re&s;tore the bloom of a decayed and a &s;ickly body.</P>
<P>IT is indeed happy for mankind, that this im|portant object is not always dependent on the wi&s;dom of &s;overeigns, or the policy of &s;ingle men. A people intent on freedom, find for them&s;elves a condition in which they may follow the propen&s;i|ties of nature with a more &s;ignal effect, than any which the councils of &s;tate could devi&s;e. When &s;overeigns, or projectors, are the &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ters of this &s;ubject, the be&s;t they can do, is to be cau|tious of hurting an intere&s;t they cannot greatly promote, and of making breaches they cannot re|pair.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="217"><Q>When nations were divided into &s;mall terri|tories, and petty commonwealths, where each man had his hou&s;e and his field to him&s;elf, and each county had its capital free and indepen|dent what a happy &s;ituation for mankind,</Q> &s;ays Mr. Hume, <Q>how favourable to indu&s;try and agriculture, to marriage, and to population!</Q>
Yet here were probably no &s;chemes of the &s;tate&s;man for rewarding the married, or for puni&s;hing the &s;ingle; for inviting foreigners to &s;ettle, or for prohibiting the departure of natives. Every citi|zen finding a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ecure, and a provi&s;ion for his heirs, was not di&s;couraged by the gloomy fears of oppre&s;&s;ion or want: and where every other function of nature was free, that which furni&s;hed the nur&s;ery could not be re&s;trained. Nature has required the powerful to be ju&s;t; but &s;he has not otherwi&s;e intru&s;ted the pre&s;ervation of her works to their vi&s;ionary plans. What fewel can the &s;tate&s;man add to the fires of youth? Let him only not &s;mother it, and the effect is &s;ecure. Where we oppre&s;s or degrade mankind with one hand, it is vain, like Octavius, to hold out in the other, the baits of marriage, or the whip to bar|renne&s;s. It is vain to invite new inhabitants from abroad, while tho&s;e we already po&s;&s;e&s;s are made to hold their tenure with uncertainty; and to tremble, not only under the pro&s;pect of a nume|rous family, but even under that of a precarious and doubtful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves, The ar|bitrary &s;overeign, who has made this the condi|tion of his &s;ubjects, owes the remains of his peo|ple to the powerful in&s;tincts of nature, not to any device of his own.</P>

The frequent wars of the Ro|mans, and of many a thriving community; even the pe&s;tilence, and the market for &s;laves, find their &s;upply, if, without de&s;troying the &s;ource, the drain become regular; and if an i&s;&s;ue is made for the offspring, without un&s;ettling the families from which they ari&s;e. Where a happier provi&s;ion is made for mankind, the &s;tate&s;man, who by pre|miums to marriage, by allurements to foreigners, or by confining the natives at home, apprehends, that he has made the numbers of his people to grow, is often like the fly in the fable, who ad|mired its &s;ucce&s;s, in turning the wheel, and in moving the carriage: he has only accompanied what was already in motion; he has da&s;hed with his oar, to ha&s;ten the cataract; and waved with his fan, to give &s;peed to the winds.</P>

Above a hundred thou&s;and pea&s;ants, we are told, were yearly driven, like &s;o many cattle, to Peter&s;burgh, in the fir&s;t attempts to repleni&s;h that &s;ettlement, and yearly peri&s;hed for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strachlenberg.</NOTE>. The Indian only attempts to &s;ettle in the neighbourhood of the plantain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier.</NOTE>, and while his family increa&s;es, he adds a tree to the walk.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="219">
IF the plantain, the cocoa, or the palm, were &s;ufficient to maintain an inhabitant, the race of men in the warmer climates might become as nu|merous as the trees of the fore&s;t. But in many parts of the earth, from the nature of the climate, and the &s;oil, the &s;pontaneous produce being next to nothing; the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence are the fruits only of labour and &s;kill. If a people, while they retain their frugality, increa&s;e their indu&s;try, and improve their arts, their numbers mu&s;t grow in proportion. Hence it is, that the cultivated fields of Europe are more peopled than the wilds of America, or the plains of Tartary.</P>
<P>BUT even the increa&s;e of mankind which at|tends the accumulation of wealth, has its limits. The <HI>nece&s;&s;ary of life</HI> is a vague and a relative term: it is one thing in the opinion of the &s;avage; an|other in that of the poli&s;hed citizen: it has a re|ference to the fancy, and to the habits of living. While arts improve, and riches increa&s;e; while the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of individuals, or their pro&s;pects of gain, come up to their opinion of what is required to &s;ettle a family, they enter on its cares with alacrity. But when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, however re|dundant, falls &s;hort of the &s;tandard, and a for|tune &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient for marriage is attained with difficulty, population is checked, or begins to decline. The citizen, in his own apprehen&s;ion, returns to the &s;tate of the &s;avage; his children, he thinks, mu&s;t peri&s;h for want; and he quits a &s;cene overflowing with plenty, becau&s;e he has not the fortune which his &s;uppo&s;ed rank, or his wi&s;hes, require. No ultimate remedy is applied to this evil, by merely accumulating wealth; for rare and
<PB N="214" REF="220">
co&s;tly materials, whatever the&s;e are, continue to be &s;ought; and if &s;ilks and pearl are made com|mon, men will begin to covet &s;ome new decora|tions, which the wealthy alone can procure. If they are indulged in their humour, their demands are repeated: For it is the continual increa&s;e of riches, not any mea&s;ure attained, that keeps the craving imagination at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>MEN are tempted to labour, and to practi&s;e lucrative arts, by motives of intere&s;t. Secure to the workman the fruit of his labour, give him the pro&s;pects of independence or freedom, the public has found a faithful mini&s;ter in the acqui&s;ition of wealth, and a faithful &s;teward in hoarding what he has gained. The &s;tate&s;man in this, as in the ca&s;e of population it&s;elf, can do little more than avoid doing mi&s;chief. It is well, if, in the begin|nings of commerce, he knows how to repre&s;s the frauds to which it is &s;ubject. Commerce, if con|tinued, is the branch in which men committed to the effects of their own experience, are lea&s;t apt to go wrong.</P>
<P>THE trader, in rude ages, is &s;hort-&s;ighted, fraudulent, and mercenary; but in the progre&s;s and advanced &s;tate of his art, his views are en|larged, his maxims are e&s;tabli&s;hed: he becomes punctual, liberal, faithful, and enterpri&s;ing; and in the period of general corruption, he alone has every virtue, except the force to defend his acqui|&s;itions. He needs no aid from the &s;tate, but its protection; and is often in him&s;elf its mo&s;t in|telligent and re&s;pectable member. Even in China, we are informed, where pilfering, fraud, and corruption, are the reigning practice with all
<PB N="215" REF="221">
the other orders of men, the great merchant is ready to give, and to procure confidence: while his countrymen act on the plans and under the re|&s;trictions of a police adju&s;ted to knaves, he acts on the rea&s;ons of trade, and the maxims of man|kind.</P>
<P>IF population be connected with national wealth, liberty and per&s;onal &s;ecurity is the great founda|tion of both: and if this foundation be laid in the &s;tate, nature has &s;ecured the increa&s;e and the in|du&s;try of its members; the one by de&s;ires the mo&s;t ardent in the human frame; the other by a con|&s;ideration the mo&s;t uniform and con&s;tant of any that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind. The great object of po|licy, therefore, with re&s;pect to both, is, to &s;ecure to the family its means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ettle|ment; to protect the indu&s;trious in the pur&s;uit of his occupation; to reconcile the re&s;trictions of po|lice, and the &s;ocial affections of mankind, with their &s;eparate and intere&s;ted pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>IN matters of particular profe&s;&s;ion, indu&s;try, and trade, the experienced practitioner is the ma&s;|ter, and every general rea&s;oner is a novice. The object in commerce is to make the individual rich; the more he gains for him&s;elf, the more he augments the wealth of his country. If a pro|tection be required, it mu&s;t be granted; if crimes and frauds be committed, they mu&s;t be repre&s;&s;ed; and government can pretend to no more. When the refined politician would lend an active hand, he only multiplies interruptions and grounds of complaint; when the merchant forgets his own intere&s;t to lay plans for his country, the period of vi&s;ion and chimera is near, and the &s;olid ba&s;is of
<PB N="216" REF="222">
commerce withdrawn. He might be told, per|haps, that while he pur&s;ues his advantage, and gives no cau&s;e of complaint, the intere&s;t of com|merce is &s;afe.</P>
<P>THE general police of France, proceeding on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the exportation of corn mu&s;t drain the country where it has grown, had, till of late, laid that branch of commerce under a &s;evere prohibition. The Engli&s;h landholder and the far|mer had credit enough to obtain a premium for exportation, to favour the &s;ale of their commo|dity; and the event has &s;hewn, that private inte|re&s;t is a better patron of commerce and plenty, than the refinements of &s;tate. One nation lays the refined plan of a &s;ettlement on the continent of North America, and tru&s;ts little to the conduct of traders and &s;hort-&s;ighted men; another leaves men to find their own po&s;ition in a &s;tate of freedom, and to think for them&s;elves. The active indu&s;try and the limited views of the one, made a thriv|ing &s;ettlement; the great projects of the other were &s;till in idea.</P>
<P>BUT I willingly quit a &s;ubject in which I am not much conver&s;ant, and &s;till le&s;s engaged by the views with which I write. Speculations on com|merce and wealth have been delivered by the able&s;t writers, who have left nothing &s;o important to be offered on the &s;ubject, as the general caution, not to con&s;ider the&s;e articles as making the &s;um of national felicity, or the principal object of any &s;tate.</P>
<P>ONE nation, in &s;earch of gold and of preci|ous metals, neglect the dome&s;tic &s;ources of wealth,

and become dependent on their neighbours for the nece&s;&s;aries of life: another &s;o intent on improving their internal re&s;ources, and on increa&s;ing their commerce, that they become dependent on fo|reigners for the defence of what they acquire. It is even painful in conver&s;ation to find the in|tere&s;ts of trade give the tone to our rea&s;onings, and to find a &s;ubject perpetually offered as the great bu&s;ine&s;s of national councils, to which any interpo&s;ition of government is &s;eldom, with pro|priety, applied, or never beyond the protection it affords.</P>
<P>WE complain of a want of public &s;pirit; but whatever may be the effect of this error in prac|tice, in &s;peculation it is none of our faults<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> we rea&s;on perpetually for the public; but the want of national views were frequently better than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e we expre&s;s: we would have na|tions, like a company of merchants, think of no|thing but the increa&s;e of their &s;tock; a&s;&s;emble to deliberate on profit and lo&s;s; and, like them too, intru&s;t their protection to a force which they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BECAUSE men, like other animals are main|tained in multitudes, where the nece&s;&s;aries of life are ama&s;&s;ed, and the &s;tore of wealth is enlarged, we drop our regards for the happine&s;s, the moral and political character of a people; and anxious for the herd we would propagate, carry our views no farther than the &s;tall and the pa&s;ture. We for|get that the few have often made a prey of the many; that to the poor there is nothing &s;o enti|cing as the coffers of the rich; and that when the price of freedom comes to be paid, the heavy
<PB N="218" REF="224">
&s;word of the victor may fall into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the actual conduct of nations in this matter, it is certain, that many of our ar|guments would hurry us, for the &s;ake of wealth and of population, into a &s;cene where mankind being expo&s;ed to corruption, are unable to defend their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and where they are, in the end, &s;ubject to oppre&s;&s;ion and ruin. We cut off the roots, while we would extend the branches, and thicken the foliage.</P>
<P>IT is po&s;&s;ibly from an opinion that the virtues of men are &s;ecure, that &s;ome who turn their at|tention to public affairs, think of nothing but the numbers and wealth of a people: it is from a dread of corruption, that others think of nothing but how to pre&s;erve the national virtues. Human &s;o|ciety has great obligations to both. They are op|po&s;ed to one another only by mi&s;take; and even when united, have not &s;trength &s;ufficient to com|bat the wretched party, that refers every object to per&s;onal intere&s;t, and that cares not for the &s;afety or increa&s;e of any &s;tock but its own.</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain how much of the policy of any &s;tate has a reference to war, or to national &s;afety. <Q>Our legi&s;lator,</Q> &s;ays the Cretan in Plato,
<Q>thought that nations were by nature in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility: he took his mea|&s;ures accordingly; and ob&s;erving that all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the vanqui&s;hed pertain to the vic|tor, he held it ridiculous to propo&s;e any be|nefit to his country, before he had provided that it &s;hould not be conquered.</Q></P>
<P>CRETE, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a mo|del of military policy, is commonly con&s;idered as the original from which the celebrated laws of Lycurgus were copied. Mankind, it &s;eems, in every in&s;tance, mu&s;t have &s;ome palpable object to direct their proceedings, and mu&s;t have a view to &s;ome point of external utility, even in the choice of their virtues. The di&s;cipline of Sparta was military; and a &s;en&s;e of its u&s;e in the field, more than the force of unwritten and traditionary laws, or the &s;uppo&s;ed engagements of the public faith obtained by the lawgiver, may have induced this people to per&s;evere in the ob&s;ervance of many rules, which to other nations do not appear nece&s;|&s;ary, except in the pre&s;ence of an enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="226">
EVERY in&s;titution of this &s;ingular people gave a le&s;&s;on of obedience, of fortitude, and of zeal for the public: but it is remarkable that they cho&s;e to obtain, by their virtues alone, what other na|tions are fain to buy with their trea&s;ure; and it is well known, that, in the cour&s;e of their hi&s;tory, they came to regard their di&s;cipline merely on account of its moral effects. They had experi|enced the happine&s;s of a mind courageous, di&s;|intere&s;ted, and devoted to its be&s;t affections; and they &s;tudied to pre&s;erve this character in them|&s;elves, by re&s;igning the intere&s;ts of ambition, and the hopes of military glory, even by &s;acrificing the numbers of their people.</P>
<P>IT was the fate of Spartans who e&s;caped from the field, not of tho&s;e who peri&s;hed with Cleom|brotus at Leuctra, that filled the cottages of La|cedemon with mourning and &s;erious reflection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xenophon.</NOTE>: it was the fear of having their citizens corrupted abroad, by intercour&s;e with &s;ervile and mercenary men, that made them quit the &s;tation of leaders in the Per&s;ian war, and leave Athens, during fifty years, to pur&s;ue, unrivalled, that career of ambi|tion and profit, by which &s;he made &s;uch acqui&s;i|tions of power and of wealth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thucydides, book. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that in every rude &s;tate, the great bu&s;ine&s;s is war; and that in barbarous times, mankind, being general|ly divided into &s;mall parties, are engaged in al|mo&s;t
<PB N="221" REF="227">
perpetual ho&s;tilities. This circum&s;tance gives the military leader a continued a&s;cendant in his country, and inclines every people, during war|like ages, to monarchical government.</P>
<P>THE conduct of an army can lea&s;t of all &s;ub|jects be divided: and we may be ju&s;tly &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that the Romans, after many ages of mi|litary experience, and after having recently felt the arms of Hannibal, in many encounters, a&s;&s;o|ciated two leaders at the head of the &s;ame army, and left them to adju&s;t their preten&s;ions, by ta|king the command, each a day in his turn. The &s;ame people, however, on other occa&s;ions, thought it expedient to &s;u&s;pend the exerci&s;e of every &s;ub|ordinate magi&s;tracy, and in the time of great alarms, to intru&s;t all the authority of the &s;tate in the hands of one per&s;on.</P>
<P>REPUBLICS have generally found it nece&s;&s;ary, in the conduct of war, to place great confidence in the executive branch of their government. When a con&s;ul at Rome had proclaimed his le|vies, and admini&s;tered the military oath, he be|came from that moment ma&s;ter of the public trea|&s;ury, and of the lives of tho&s;e who were under his command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polybius.</NOTE>. The axe and the rods were no longer a mere badge of magi&s;tracy, or an empty pageant, in the hands of the lictor: they were, at the command of the father, &s;tained with the blood of his own children; and fell, without ap|peal, on the mutinous and the di&s;obedient of every condition.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="228">
IN every free &s;tate, there is a perpetual nece&s;&s;ity to di&s;tingui&s;h the maxims of martial law from tho&s;e of the civil; and he who has not learned to give an implicit obedience, where the &s;tate has given him a military leader, and to re&s;ign his per&s;onal freedom in the field, from the &s;ame magnanimity with which he maintains it in the political deliber|ations of his country, has yet to learn the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;on of civil &s;ociety, and is only fit to occupy a place in a rude, or in a corrupted &s;tate, where the principles of mutiny and of &s;ervility be|ing joined, the one or the other is frequently adopted in the wrong place.</P>
<P>FROM a regard to what is nece&s;&s;ary in war, nations inclined to popular or ari&s;tocratical govern|ment, have had recour&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;hments that bordered on monarchy. Even where the highe&s;t office of the &s;tate was in common times admini|&s;tered by a plurality of per&s;ons, the whole power and authority belonging to it was, on particular occa&s;ions, committed to one; and upon great a|larms, when the political fabric was &s;haken or en|dangered, a monarchical power has been applied, like a prop, to &s;ecure the &s;tate again&s;t the rage of the tempe&s;t. Thus were the dictators occa&s;ionally named at Rome, and the &s;tadtholders in the Uni|ted Provinces; and thus, in mixed governments, the royal prerogative is occa&s;ionally enlarged, by the temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Britain, by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas corpus.</HI></NOTE>, and the bar|riers of liberty appear to be removed, in order to ve&s;t a dictatorial power in the hands of the king.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="229">
HAD mankind, therefore, no view but to war|fare, it is probable that they would continue to prefer monarchical government to any other; or at lea&s;t that every nation, in order to procure &s;ecret and united councils, would intru&s;t the exe|cutive power with unlimited authority. But, happily for civil &s;ociety, men have objects of a different &s;ort: and experience has taught, that al|though the conduct of armies requires an ab&s;olute and undivided command; yet a national force is be&s;t formed, where numbers of men are inured to equality; and where the meane&s;t citizen may con|&s;ider him&s;elf, upon occa&s;ion, as de&s;tined to com|mand as well as to obey. It is here that the dic|tator finds a &s;pirit and a force prepared to &s;econd his councils; it is here too that the dictator him|&s;elf is formed, and that numbers of leaders are pre|&s;ented to the public choice; it is here that the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate is independent of &s;ingle men, and that a wi&s;dom which never dies, with a &s;y&s;tem of military arrangements permanent and regular, can, even under the greate&s;t misfortunes, prolong the national &s;truggle. With this advantage, the Romans, finding a number of di&s;tingui&s;hed lead|ers ari&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were at all times almo&s;t e|qually prepared to contend with their enemies of A&s;ia or Africa; while the fortune of tho&s;e ene|mies, on the contrary depended on the ca&s;ual ap|pearance of &s;ingular men, of a Mithridates, or of a Hannibal.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldier, we are told, has his point of honour; and a fa&s;hion of thinking, which he wears with his &s;word. This point of honour, in free and uncorrupted &s;tates, is a zeal for the public; and
<PB N="224" REF="230">
war to them, is an operation of pa&s;&s;ions, not the mere pur&s;uit of a calling. Its good and its ill effects are felt in extremes: the friend is made to experience the warme&s;t proofs of attachment, the enemy the &s;evere&s;t effects of animo&s;ity. On this &s;y&s;tem the celebrated nations of antiquity made war under their highe&s;t attainments of ci|vility, and under their greate&s;t degrees of refine|ment.</P>
<P>IN &s;mall and rude &s;ocieties, the individual finds him&s;elf attacked in every national war; and none can propo&s;e to devolve his defence on another. <Q>The King of Spain is a great prince,</Q> &s;aid an American chief to the governor of Jamaica, who was preparing a body of troops to join in an en|terpri&s;e again&s;t the Spaniards:
<Q>do you propo&s;e to make war upon &s;o great a king with &s;o &s;mall a force?</Q>
Being told that the forces he &s;aw were to be joined by troops from Europe, and that the governor could then command no more:
<Q>Who are the&s;e then,</Q> &s;aid the American, <Q>who form this croud of &s;pectators? are they not your people? and why do you not all go forth to &s;o great a war?</Q>
He was an&s;wered, That the &s;pectators were merchants, and other inhabitants, who took no part in the &s;ervice:
<Q>Would they be merchants &s;till,</Q> continued this &s;tate&s;man, <Q>if the King of Spain was to attack you here? For my part, I do not think that merchants &s;hould be permitted to live in any country: when I go to war, I leave no body at home but the women.</Q>
It &s;hould &s;eem that this &s;imple warrior con&s;idered merchants as a kind of neutral per&s;ons, who took no part in the quarrels of their country; and that he did not know how much
<PB N="225" REF="231">
war it&s;elf may be made a &s;ubject of traffic; what mighty armies may be put in motion from be|hind the counter; how often human blood is, with|out any national animo&s;ity, bought and &s;old for bills of exchange; and how often the prince, the nobles, and the &s;tate&s;men, in many a poli&s;hed na|tion, might, in his account, be con&s;idered as mer|chants.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of arts and of policy, the mem|bers of every &s;tate are divided into cla&s;&s;es; and in the commencement of this di&s;tribution, there is no di&s;tinction more &s;erious than that of the war|rior and the pacific inhabitant; no more is requir|ed to place men in the relation of ma&s;ter and &s;lave. Even when the rigours of an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;lavery abate, as they have done in modern Europe, in con&s;equence of a protection, and a property, al|lowed to the mechanic and labourer, this di&s;tinc|tion &s;erves &s;till to &s;eparate the noble from the ba&s;e, and to point out that cla&s;s of men who are de|&s;tined to reign and to domineer in their country.</P>
<P>IT was certainly never fore&s;een by mankind, that in the pur&s;uit of refinement, they were to re|ver&s;e this order; or even that they were to place the government, and the military force of nations, in different hands. But is it equally unfore&s;een, that the former order may again take place? and that the pacific citizen, however di&s;tingui&s;hed by pri|vilege and rank, mu&s;t one day bow to the per|&s;on with whom he has intru&s;ted his &s;word. If &s;uch revolutions &s;hould actually follow, will this new ma&s;ter revive in his own order the &s;pirit of the noble and the free? Will he renew the cha|racters of the warrior and the &s;tate&s;man? Will he
<PB N="226" REF="232">
re&s;tore to his country the civil and military virtues? I am afraid to reply. Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, that the government of Rome, even under the em|perors, became in the hands of the troops, elec|tive and republican: but the Fabii or the Bruti were heard of no more, after the praetorian bands became the republic.</P>
<P>WE have enumerated &s;ome of the heads under which a people, as they emerge from barbarity, may come to be cla&s;&s;ed. Such are, the nobility, the people, the adherents of the prince; and even the prie&s;thood have not been forgotten: when we arrive at times of refinement, the army mu&s;t be joined to the li&s;t. The departments of civil go|vernment and of war being &s;evered, and the pre|eminence being given to the &s;tate&s;man, the am|bitious will naturally devolve the military &s;ervice on tho&s;e who are contented with a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. They who have the greate&s;t &s;hare in the divi&s;ion of fortune, and the greate&s;t intere&s;t in de|fending their country, having re&s;igned the &s;word, mu&s;t pay for what they have cea&s;ed to perform; and armies, not only at a di&s;tance from home, but in the very bo&s;om of their country, are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by pay. A di&s;cipline is invented to inure the &s;ol|dier to perform, from habit, and from the fear of puni&s;hment, tho&s;e hazardous duties, which the love of the public, or national &s;pirit, no longer in&s;pire.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the breach that &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment makes in the &s;y&s;tem of national vir|tues, it is unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t nations who have run the career of civil arts, have, in &s;ome degree, adopted this mea&s;ure. Not only
<PB N="227" REF="233">
&s;tates, which either have wars to maintain, or pre|carious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to defend at a di&s;tance; not only a prince jealous of his authority, or in ha&s;te to gain the advantage of di&s;cipline, are di&s;po&s;ed to employ foreign troops, or to keep &s;tanding armies; but even republics, with little of the former occa&s;ion, and none of the motives which prevail in monarchy, have been found to tread in the &s;ame path.</P>
<P>IF military arrangements occupy &s;o con&s;ider|able a place in the dome&s;tic policy of nations, the actual con&s;equences of war are equally important in the hi&s;tory of mankind. Glory and &s;poil were the earlie&s;t &s;ubject of quarrels; a conce&s;&s;ion of &s;u|periority, or a ran&s;om, were the prices of peace. The love of &s;afety, and the de&s;ire of dominion, equally lead mankind to wi&s;h for acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength. Whether as victors or as vanqui&s;hed, they tend to a coalition; and powerful nations con|&s;idering a province, or a fortre&s;s acquired on their frontier, as &s;o much gained, are perpetually intent on extending their limits.</P>
<P>THE maxims of conque&s;t are not always to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of &s;elf-defence.

THE equality of tho&s;e alliances which the Gre|cian &s;tates formed again&s;t each other, maintained, for a time, their independence and &s;eparation; and that time was the &s;hining and the happy period of their &s;tory. It was prolonged more by the vi|gilance and conduct which they &s;everally applied, than by the moderation of their councils, or by any peculiarities of dome&s;tic policy which arre&s;ted their progre&s;s. The victors were &s;ometimes con|tented, with merely changing to a re&s;em|blance of their own forms the government of the &s;tates they &s;ubdued. What the next &s;tep might have been in the progre&s;s of impo&s;itions, is hard to determine. But when we con&s;ider, that one party fought for the impo&s;ition of tributes, another for the a&s;cendant in war, it cannot be doubted, that the Athenians, from a national ambition, and from the de&s;ire of wealth, and the Spartans, though they originally only meant to de|fend them&s;elves, and their allies, were both, at la&s;t, equally willing to become the ma&s;ters of Greece; and were preparing for each other at home, that yoke, which both, together with their confederates, were obliged to receive from a|broad.</P>
<P>IN the conque&s;ts of Philip, the de&s;ire of &s;elf|pre&s;ervation and &s;ecurity &s;eemed to be blended with the ambition natural to princes. He turned his arms &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the quarters on which he found him&s;elf hurt, from which he had been a|larmed or provoked: and when he had &s;ubdued the Greeks he propo&s;ed to lead them again&s;t their ancient enemy of Per&s;ia. In this he laid the plan which was carried into execution by his &s;on.</P>

THE Romans, become the ma&s;ters of Italy, and the conquerors of Carthage, had been alarm|ed on the &s;ide of Macedon, and were led to cro&s;s a new &s;ea in &s;earch of a new field, on which to exerci&s;e their military force. In pro&s;ecution of their wars, from the earlie&s;t to the late&s;t date of their hi&s;tory, without intending the very conque&s;ts they made, perhaps without fore&s;eeing what ad|vantage they were to reap from the &s;ubjection of di&s;tant provinces, or in what manner they were to govern their new acqui&s;itions, they &s;till pro|ceeded to &s;eize what came &s;ucce&s;&s;ively within their reach; and, &s;timulated by a policy which enga|ged them in perpetual wars, which led to perpe|tual victory and acce&s;&s;ions of territory, they ex|tended the frontier of a &s;tate, which, but a few centuries before, had been confined within the &s;kirts of a village, to the Euphrates, the Danube, the We&s;er, the Forth, and the ocean.</P>

<P>EVERY tribe of warlike barbarians may en|tertain among them&s;elves the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of affection and honour, while they carry to the re&s;t of mankind the a&s;pect of banditti and rob|bers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Arvieux's Hi&s;t. of the Arabs.</NOTE>. They may be indifferent to intere&s;t, and &s;uperior to danger; but our &s;en&s;e of humanity, our regard to the rights of nations, our admiration of civil wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, even our effeminacy it&s;elf, make us turn away with contempt, or with horror, from a &s;cene which exhibits &s;o few of our good qualities, and which &s;erve &s;o much to re|proach our weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is in conducting the affairs of civil &s;ociety, that mankind find the exerci&s;e of their be&s;t talents, as well as the object of their be&s;t affections. It is in being grafted on the advantages of civil &s;o|ciety, that the art of war is brought to perfection; that the re&s;ources of armies, and the complicated &s;prings to be touched in their conduct, are be&s;t under&s;tood. The mo&s;t celebrated warriors were al&s;o citizens: Oppo&s;ed to a Roman, or a Greek, the chieftain of Thrace, of Germany, or Gaul, was a novice. The native of Pella learned the principles of his art from Epaminondas and Pelo|pidas.</P>

IF nations, as hath been ob&s;erved in the pre|ceding &s;ection, mu&s;t adju&s;t their policy on the pro&s;|pect of war from abroad, they are equally bound to provide for the attainment of peace at home. But there is no peace in the ab&s;ence of ju&s;tice. It may &s;ub&s;i&s;t with divi&s;ions, di&s;putes, and contrary opi|nions; but not with the commi&s;&s;ion of wrongs. The injurious, and the injured, are, as implied in the very meaning of the terms, in a &s;tate of ho&s;|tility.</P>
<P>WHERE men enjoy peace, they owe it either to their mutual regards and affections, or to the re&s;traints of law. Tho&s;e are the happie&s;t &s;tates which procure peace to their members by the fir&s;t of the&s;e methods: But it is &s;ufficiently uncom|mon to procure it even by the &s;econd. The fir&s;t would with-hold the occa&s;ions of war and of competition: The &s;econd adju&s;ts the preten&s;ions of men by &s;tipulations and treaties. Sparta taught her citizens not to regard intere&s;t: Other free na|tions &s;ecure the intere&s;t of their members, and con&s;ider this as a principal part of their rights.</P>
<P>LAW is the treaty to which members of the &s;ame community have agreed, and under which the magi&s;trate and the &s;ubject continue to enjoy their rights, and to maintain the peace of &s;ociety. The de&s;ire of lucre is the great motive to inju|ries: law therefore has a principal reference to property. It would a&s;certain the different me|thods by which property may be acquired, as by pre&s;cription, conveyance, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and it makes the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for rendering the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property &s;ecure.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240">
BESIDE avarice, there are other motives from which men are unju&s;t; &s;uch are pride, malice, envy, and revenge. The law would eradicate the principles them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t prevent their ef|fects.</P>
<P>FROM whatever motive wrongs are committed, there are different particulars in which the injured may &s;uffer. He may &s;uffer in his goods, in his per&s;on, or in the freedom of his conduct. Nature has made him ma&s;ter of every action which is not injurious to others. The laws of his particular &s;o|ciety intitle him perhaps to a determinate &s;tation, and be&s;tow on him a certain &s;hare in the govern|ment of his country. An injury, therefore, which in this re&s;pect puts him under any unju&s;t re&s;traint, may be called an infringement of his political rights.</P>
<P>WHERE the citizen is &s;uppo&s;ed to have rights of property and of &s;tation, and is protected in the exerci&s;e of them, he is &s;aid to be free; and the very re&s;traints by which he is hindered from the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, are a part of his liberty. No per&s;on is free, where any per&s;on is &s;uffered to do wrong with impunity. Even the de&s;potic prince on his throne, is not an exception to this general rule. He him&s;elf is a &s;lave, the moment he pre|tends that force &s;hould decide any conte&s;t. The di&s;regard he throws on the rights of his people re|coils on him&s;elf; and in the general uncertainty of all conditions, there is no tenure more precari|ous than his own.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="241">
FROM the different particulars to which men refer, in &s;peaking of liberty, whether to the &s;afe|ty of the per&s;on and the goods, the dignity of rank, or the participation of political importance, as well as from the different methods by which their rights are &s;ecured, they are led to differ in the interpretation of the term; and every people is apt to imagine, that its &s;ignification is to be found only among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SOME having thought, that the unequal di&s;tri|bution of wealth is unju&s;t, required a new divi|&s;ion of property, as the foundation of freedom. This &s;cheme is &s;uited to democratical government; and in &s;uch only it has been admitted with any degree of effect.</P>
<P>NEW &s;ettlements, like that of the people of I&s;rael, and &s;ingular e&s;tabli&s;hments, like tho&s;e of Sparta and Crete, have furni&s;hed examples of its actual execution; but in mo&s;t other &s;tates, even the democratical &s;pirit could attain no more than to prolong the &s;truggle for Agrarian laws; to pro|cure, on occa&s;ion, the expunging of debts; and to keep the people in mind, under all the di&s;tincti|ons of fortune, that they &s;till had a claim to e|quality.</P>
<P>THE citizen at Rome, at Athens, and in many republics, contended for him&s;elf, and his order. The Agrarian law was moved and debated for ages: it &s;erved to awaken the mind: it nouri&s;hed the &s;pirit of equality, and furni&s;hed a field on which to exert its force; but was never e&s;tabli&s;hed with any of its other and more formal effects.</P>

MANY of the e&s;tabli&s;hments which &s;erve to defend the weak from oppre&s;&s;ion, contribute, by &s;ecuring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, to favour its unequal divi&s;ion, and to increa&s;e the a&s;cendant of tho&s;e from whom the abu&s;es of power may be feared.

<P>IT has been propo&s;ed to prevent the exce&s;&s;ive accumulation of wealth in particular hands, by limiting the increa&s;e of private fortunes, by prohi|biting entails, and by with-holding the right of primogeniture in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs. It has been propo&s;ed to prevent the ruin of moderate e&s;tates, and to re&s;train the u&s;e, and con&s;equently the de&s;ire, of great ones, by &s;umptuary laws. The&s;e different methods are more or le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;ts of commerce, and may be a|dopted, in different degrees, by a people who&s;e national object is wealth: and they have their de|gree of effect, by in&s;piring moderation, or a &s;en&s;e of equality, and by &s;tifling the pa&s;&s;ions by which mankind are prompted to mutual wrongs.</P>
<P>IT appears to be, in a particular manner, the object of &s;umptuary laws, and of the equal divi|&s;ion of wealth, to prevent the gratification of va|nity, to check the o&s;tentation of &s;uperior fortune, and, by this means, to weaken the de&s;ire of riches, and to pre&s;erve in the brea&s;t of the citizen, that moderation and equity which ought to regulate his conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="243">
THIS end is never perfectly attained in any &s;tate where the unequal divi&s;ion of property is ad|mitted, and where fortune is allowed to be&s;tow di&s;tinction and rank. It is indeed difficult, by any methods whatever, to &s;hut up this &s;ource of corruption. Of all the nations who&s;e hi&s;tory is known with certainty, the de&s;ign it&s;elf, and the manner of executing it, appear to have been un|der&s;tood in Sparta alone.</P>
<P>THERE property was indeed acknowledged by law; but in con&s;equence of certain regulations and practices, the mo&s;t effectual, it &s;eems, that man|kind have hitherto found out. The manners that prevail among &s;imple nations before the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of property, were in &s;ome mea&s;ure pre|&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part 2. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>; the pa&s;&s;ion for riches was, during many ages, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and the citizen was made to con|&s;ider him&s;elf as the property of his country, not as the owner of a private e&s;tate.</P>
<P>IT was held ignominious either to buy or to &s;ell the patrimony of a citizen. Slaves were, in every family, intru&s;ted with the care of its effects, and freemen were &s;trangers to lucrative arts; ju&s;|tice was e&s;tabli&s;hed on a contempt of the ordinary allurement to crimes; and the pre&s;ervatives of civil liberty applied by the &s;tate, were the di&s;po|&s;itions that were made to prevail in the hearts of its members.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="244">
THE individual was relieved from every &s;oli|citude that could ari&s;e on the head of his fortune: he was educated, and he was employed for life in the &s;ervice of the public; he was fed at a place of common re&s;ort, to which he could carry no di|&s;tinction but that of his talents and his virtues; his children were the wards and the pupils of the &s;tate; he him&s;elf was taught to be a parent, and a director to the youth of his country, not the anxious father of a &s;eparate family.</P>
<P>THIS people, we are told, be&s;towed &s;ome care in adorning their per&s;ons, and were known from afar by the red or the purple they wore; but could not make their equipage, their build|ings, or their furniture, a &s;ubject of fancy, or of what we call <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> The carpenter and the hou&s;e|builder were re&s;tricted to the u&s;e of the axe and the &s;aw: their workman&s;hip mu&s;t have been &s;im|ple, and probably, in re&s;pect to its form, conti|nued for ages the &s;ame. The ingenuity of the arti&s;t was employed in cultivating his own nature, not in adorning the habitations of his fellow|citizens.</P>
<P>ON this plan, they had &s;enators, magi&s;trates, leaders of armies, and mini&s;ters of &s;tate; but no men of fortune. Like the heroes of Homer, they di&s;tributed honours by the mea&s;ure of the cup and the platter.

<P>AFTER all, we are, perhaps, not &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in the nature of the Spartan laws and in&s;titutions, to under&s;tand in what manner all the ends of this &s;ingular &s;tate were obtained; but the admiration paid to its people, and the con&s;tant reference of contemporary hi&s;torians to their a|vowed &s;uperiority, will not allow us to que&s;tion the facts.
<Q>When I ob&s;erved,</Q> &s;ays Xenophon, <Q>that this nation, though not the mo&s;t populous, was the mo&s;t powerful &s;tate of Greece, I was &s;eized with wonder, and with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to know by what arts it attained its pre|eminence; but when I came to the know|ledge of its in&s;titutions, my wonder cea&s;ed.&mdash;As one man excels another, and as he who is at pains to cultivate his mind, mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s the per&s;on who neglects it; &s;o the Spartans &s;hould excel every nation, being the only &s;tate in which virtue is &s;tudied as the object of govern|ment.'!</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of property, con&s;idered with a view to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or even to enjoyment, have little effect in corrupting mankind, or in awaken|ing the &s;pirit of competition and of jealou&s;y; but con&s;idered with a view to di&s;tinction and honour, where fortune con&s;titutes rank, they excite the mo&s;t vehement pa&s;&s;ions, and ab&s;orb all the &s;enti|ments of the human &s;oul: they reconcile avarice
<PB N="240" REF="246">
and meanne&s;s with ambition and vanity; and lead men through the practice of &s;ordid and mercenary arts to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;uppo&s;ed elevation and dignity.</P>
<P>WHERE this &s;ource of corruption, on the con|trary, is effectually &s;topped, the citizen is dutiful, and the magi&s;trate upright; and form of govern|ment may be wi&s;ely admini&s;tered; places of tru&s;t are likely to be well &s;upplied; and by whatever rule office and power are be&s;towed, it is likely that all the capacity and force that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tate will come to be employed in its &s;ervice: for on this &s;uppo&s;ition, experience and abilities are the only guides and the only titles to public confi|dence; and if citizens be ranged into &s;eparate cla&s;&s;es, they become mutual checks by the diffe|rence of their opinions, not by the oppo&s;ition of their intere&s;ted de&s;igns.</P>
<P>WE may ea&s;ily account for the cen&s;ures be|&s;towed on the government of Sparta, by tho&s;e who con&s;idered it merely on the &s;ide of its forms. It was not calculated to prevent the practice of crimes, by balancing again&s;t each other the &s;elfi&s;h and partial di&s;po&s;itions of men; but to in&s;pire the virtues of the &s;oul, to procure innocence by the ab&s;ence of criminal inclinations, and to derive its internal peace from the indifference of its mem|bers to the ordinary motives of &s;trife and di&s;order. It were trifling to &s;eek for its analogy to any other con&s;titution of &s;tate, in which its principal cha|racteri&s;tic and di&s;tingui&s;hing feature is not to be found. The collegiate &s;overeignty, the &s;enate, and the Ephori, had their counterparts in other repub|lics, and a re&s;emblance has been found in particu|lar

to the government of Carthage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle.</NOTE>: but what affinity of con&s;equence can be found between a &s;tate who&s;e &s;ole object was virtue, and another who&s;e principal object was wealth; between a people who&s;e a&s;&s;ociated kings being lodged in the &s;ame cottage, had no fortune but their daily food; and commercial republic, in which a proper e&s;tate was required as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for the higher offices of &s;tate?</P>
<P>OTHER petty commonwealths expelled kings, when they became jealous of their de&s;igns, or after having experienced their tyranny; here the here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings was pre&s;erved: other &s;tates were afraid of the intrigues and cabals of their members in competition for dignities; here &s;olicitation was required as the only condition upon which a place in the &s;enate was obtained. A &s;u|preme inqui&s;itorial power was, in the per&s;ons of the ephori, &s;afely committed to a few men, who were drawn by lot, and without di&s;tinction, from every order of the people: and if a contra&s;t to this, as well as to many other articles of the Spar|tan policy, be required, it may be found in the general hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT Sparta, under every &s;uppo&s;ed error of its form, pro&s;pered for ages, by the integrity of its manners, and by the character of its citizens. When that integrity was broken, this people did not langui&s;h in the weakne&s;s of nations &s;unk in effeminacy. They fell into the &s;tream by which other &s;tates had been carried in the torrent of vio|lent

pa&s;&s;ions, and in the outrage of barbarous times. They ran the career of other nations, af|ter that of ancient Sparta was fini&s;hed: They built walls, and began to improve their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, after they cea&s;ed to improve their people; and on this new plan, in their &s;truggle for political life, they &s;urvived the &s;y&s;tem of &s;tates that peri&s;hed under the Macedonian dominion: They lived to act with another which aro&s;e in the Achaean league; and were the la&s;t community of Greece that became a village in the empire of Rome.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be thought we have dwelt too long on the hi&s;tory of this &s;ingular people, it may be remembered, in excu&s;e, that they alone, in the language of Xenophon, made virtue an object of &s;tate.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t be contented to derive our freedom from a different &s;ource; to expect ju&s;tice from the limits which are &s;et to the powers of the ma|gi&s;trate, and to rely for protection on the laws which are made to &s;ecure the e&s;tate, and the per|&s;on of the &s;ubject. We live in &s;ocieties, where men mu&s;t be rich, in order to be great; where plea&s;ure it&s;elf is often pur&s;ued from vanity; where the de&s;ire of a &s;uppo&s;ed happine&s;s &s;erves to inflame the wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, and is it&s;elf the foundation of mi&s;ery, where public ju&s;tice, like fetters ap|plied to the body, may, without in&s;piring the &s;en|timents of candour and equity, prevent the actual commi&s;&s;ion of crimes.</P>
<P>MANKIND come under this de&s;cription the moment they are &s;eized with their pa&s;&s;ions for riches and power. But their de&s;cription in every
<PB N="243" REF="249">
in&s;tance is mixed: in the be&s;t there is an alloy of evil; in the wor&s;t a mixture of good. Without any e&s;tabli&s;hments to pre&s;erve their manners, be|&s;ides penal laws, and the re&s;traints of police, they derive, from in&s;tinctive feelings, a love of inte|grity and candour, and, from the very contagion of &s;ociety it&s;elf, an e&s;teem for what is honourable and prai&s;e-worthy. They derive, from their union, and joint oppo&s;ition to foreign enemies, a zeal for their own community, and courage to maintain its rights. If the frequent neglect of virtue as a political object, tend to di&s;credit the under&s;tand|ings of men, its lu&s;tre, and its frequency, as a &s;pontaneous offspring of the heart, will re&s;tore the honours of our nature.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;ual and mixed &s;tate of the national manners, the &s;afety of every individual, and his political con&s;equence, depends much on him&s;elf, but more on the party to which he is joined. For this rea&s;on, all who feel a common intere&s;t, are apt to unite in parties; and, as far as that inte|re&s;t requires, mutually &s;upport each other.</P>
<P>WHERE the citizens of any free community are of different orders, each order has a peculiar &s;et of claims and preten&s;ions: relatively to the other members of the &s;tate, it is a party; relatively to the differences of intere&s;t among its own members, it may admit of numberle&s;s &s;ubdivi&s;ions But in every &s;tate there are two intere&s;ts very readily ap|prehended; that of a prince and his adherents, that of a nobility, or of any temporary faction, op|po&s;ed to the people,</P>
<P>WHERE the &s;overeign power is re&s;erved by the collective body, it appears unnece&s;&s;ary to think
<PB N="244" REF="250">
of additional e&s;tabli&s;hments for &s;ecuring the rights of the citizen. But it is difficult, if not impo&s;&s;i|ble, for the collective body to exerci&s;e this power in a manner that &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of every other political caution.</P>
<P>IF popular a&s;&s;emblies a&s;&s;ume every function of government; and if, in the &s;ame tumultuous man|ner in which they can, with great propriety, ex|pre&s;s their feelings, the &s;en&s;e of their rights, and their animo&s;ity to foreign or dome&s;tic enemies, they pretend to deliberate on points of national conduct, or to decide que&s;tions of equity and ju&s;tice; the public is expo&s;ed to manifold incon|veniencies; and popular governments would, of all others, be the mo&s;t &s;ubject to errors in admini|&s;tration, and to weakne&s;s in the execution of pub|lic mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>TO avoid the&s;e di&s;advantages, the people are always contented to delegate part of their powers. They e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;enate to debate, and to prepare, if not to determine, que&s;tions that are brought to the collective body for a final re&s;olution. They commit the executive power to &s;ome council of this &s;ort, or to a magi&s;trate who pre&s;ides in their meetings. Under the u&s;e of this nece&s;&s;ary and common expedient, even while democratical forms are mo&s;t carefully guarded, there is one party of the few, another of the many. One attacks, the other defends; and they are both ready to a&s;&s;ume in their turns. But though, in reality, a great danger to liberty ari&s;es on the part of the people them&s;elves, who, in times of corruption, are ea&s;ily made the in&s;truments of u&s;urpation and tyranny; yet, in the ordinary a&s;pect of government, the
<PB N="245" REF="251">
executive carries an air of &s;uperiority, and the rights of the people &s;eem always expo&s;ed to in|croachment.</P>
<P>THOUGH on the day that the Roman people a&s;&s;embled in their tribes, the &s;enators mixed with the croud, and the con&s;ul was no more than the &s;ervant of the multitude; yet, when this awful meeting was di&s;&s;olved, the &s;enators met to pre|&s;cribe bu&s;ine&s;s for their &s;overeign, and the con&s;ul went armed with the axe and the rods, to teach every Roman, in his &s;eparate capacity, the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion which he owed to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS, even where the collective body is &s;o|vereign, they are a&s;&s;embled only occa&s;ionally: and though on &s;uch occa&s;ions they determine every que&s;tion relative to their rights and their intere&s;ts as a people, and can a&s;&s;ert their freedom with ir|re&s;i&s;tible force; yet they do not think them&s;elves, nor are they in reality, &s;afe, without a more con|&s;tant and more uniform power operating in their favour.</P>
<P>THE multitude is every where &s;trong; but re|quires, for the &s;afety of its members, when &s;epa|rate as well as when a&s;&s;embled, a head to direct and to employ its &s;trength. For this purpo&s;e, the ephori, we are told, were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Sparta, the council of a hundred at Carthage, and the tribunes at Rome. So prepared, the popular party has, in many in&s;tances, been able to cope with its adver&s;aries, and has even trampled on the powers, whether ari&s;tocratical or monarchical, with which it would have been otherwi&s;e unequally matched. The &s;tate, in &s;uch ca&s;es, commonly
<PB N="246" REF="252">
&s;uffered by the delays, interruptions, and confu|&s;ions; which popular leaders, from private envy, or a prevailing jealou&s;y of the great, &s;eldom failed to create in the proceedings of government.</P>
<P>WHERE the people, as in &s;ome larger commu|nities, have only a &s;hare in the legi&s;lature, they cannot overwhelm the collateral powers, who hav|ing likewi&s;e a &s;hare, are in condition to defend them&s;elves: Where they act only by their repre|&s;entatives, their force may be uniformly employed. And they may make part in a con&s;titution of go|vernment more la&s;ting than any of tho&s;e in which the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or pretending to the entire legi|&s;lature, are, when a&s;&s;embled, the tyrants, and when di&s;per&s;ed, the &s;laves, of a di&s;tempered &s;tate. In governments properly mixed, the popular intere&s;t, finding a counterpoi&s;e in that of the prince or of the nobles, a balance is actually e&s;tabli&s;hed between them, in which the public freedom and the public order are made to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM &s;ome &s;uch ca&s;ual arrangement of diffe|rent intere&s;ts, all the varieties of mixed govern|ment proceed; and on the degree of con&s;idera|tion which every &s;eparate intere&s;t can procure to it&s;elf, depends the equity of the laws they enact, and the nece&s;&s;ity they are able to impo&s;e, of ad|hering &s;trictly to the terms of law in its execution. States are accordingly unequally qualified to con|duct the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation, and unequally for|tunate in the completene&s;s, and regular ob&s;ervance, of their civil code.</P>
<P>IN democratical e&s;tabli&s;hments, citizens, feel|ing them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;overeignty, are not equally anxious, with the &s;ubject of other
<PB N="247" REF="253">
governments, to have their rights explained, or secured, by actual &s;tatute. They tru&s;t to per&s;onal vigour, to the &s;upport of party, and to the &s;en&s;e of the public.</P>
<P>IF the collective body perform the office of judge, as well as of legi&s;lator, they &s;eldom think of devi&s;ing rules for their own direction, and are found &s;till more &s;eldom to follow any determinate rule, after it is made. They di&s;pen&s;e, at one time, with what they enacted at another; and in their judicative, perhaps even more than in their legi&s;lative, capacity, are guided by pa&s;&s;ions and partialties that ari&s;e from circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e before them.</P>
<P>BUT under the &s;imple&s;t governments of a dif|ferent &s;ort, whether ari&s;tocracy or monarchy, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for law, and there are a variety of intere&s;ts to be adju&s;ted in framing every &s;tatute. The &s;overeign wi&s;hes to give &s;tability and order to admini&s;tration, by expre&s;s and promulgated rules. The &s;ubject wi&s;hes to know the conditions and li|mits of his duty. He acquie&s;ces, or he revolts, according as the terms on which he is made to live with the &s;overeign, or with his fellow-&s;ubjects, are, or are not, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;en&s;e of his rights.</P>
<P>NEITHER the monarch, nor the council of nobles, where either is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;overeignty, can pretend to govern, or to judge at di&s;cretion. No magi&s;trate, whether temporary or hereditary, can with &s;afety neglect that reputation for ju&s;tice and equity, from which his authority, and the re&s;pect that is paid to his per&s;on, are in a great
<PB N="248" REF="254">
mea&s;ure derived. Nations, however, have been fortunate in the tenor, and in the execution of their laws, in proportion as they have admitted every order of the people, by repre&s;entation or otherwi&s;e, to an actual &s;hare of the legi&s;lature. Under e&s;tabli&s;hments of this &s;ort, law is literally a treaty, to which the parties concerned have a|greed, and have given their opinion in &s;ettling its terms. The intere&s;ts to be affected by a law, are likewi&s;e con&s;ulted in making it. Every cla&s;s pro|pounds an objection, &s;ugge&s;ts an addition or an amendment of its own. They proceed to adju&s;t, by &s;tatute, every &s;ubject of controver&s;y: and while they continue to enjoy their freedom, they conti|nue to multiply laws, and to accumulate volumes, as if they could remove every po&s;&s;ible ground of di&s;pute, and were &s;ecure of their rights, merely by having put them in writing.</P>
<P>ROME and England, under their mixed govern|ments, the one inclining to democracy, the other to monarchy, have proved the great legi&s;lators a|mong nations. The fir&s;t has left the foundation, and great part of the &s;uper&s;tructure of its civil code, to the continent of Europe: the other, in its i&s;land, has carried the authority and govern|ment of law to a point of perfection, which they never before attained in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>UNDER &s;uch favourable e&s;tabli&s;hments, known cu&s;toms, the practice and deci&s;ions of courts, as well as po&s;itive &s;tatutes, acquire the authority of laws; and every proceeding is conducted by &s;ome fixed and determinate rule. The be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual precautions are taken for the impartial application of rules to particular ca&s;es; and it is
<PB N="249" REF="255">
remarkable, that, in the two examples we have mentioned, a &s;urpri&s;ing coincidence is found in the &s;ingular methods of their juri&s;diction. The people in both re&s;erved in a manner the office of judgement to them&s;elves, and brought the deci&s;ion of civil rights, or of criminal que&s;tions, to the tri|bunal of peers, who, in judging of their fellow|citizens, pre&s;cribed a condition of life for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is not in mere laws, after all, that we are to look for the &s;ecurities to ju&s;tice, but in the powers by which tho&s;e laws have been obtained, and without who&s;e con&s;tant &s;upport they mu&s;t fall to di&s;u&s;e. Statutes &s;erve to record the rights of a people, and &s;peak the intention of parties to de|fend what the letter of the law has expre&s;&s;ed: but without the vigour to maintain what is acknow|ledged as a right, the mere record, or the feeble intention, is of little avail.</P>
<P>A POPULACE rou&s;ed by oppre&s;&s;ion, or an or|der of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a temporary advantage, have obtained many charters, conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;ti|pulations, in favour of their claims; but where no adequate preparation was made to pre&s;erve them, the written articles were often forgotten, together with the occa&s;ion on which they were framed.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of England, and of every free country, abounds with the example of &s;tatutes enacted when the people or their repre&s;entatives a&s;&s;embled, but never executed when the crown or the executive was left to it&s;elf. The mo&s;t e|quitable laws on paper are con&s;i&s;tent with the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="250" REF="256">
de&s;poti&s;m in admini&s;tration. Even the form of trial by juries in England had its authority in law, while the proceedings of courts were arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t admire, as the key-&s;tone of civil liberty, the &s;tatute which forces the &s;ecrets of e|very pri&s;on to be revealed, the cau&s;e of every commitment to be declared, and the per&s;on of the accu&s;ed to be produced, that he may claim his enlargement, or his trial, within a limited time. No wi&s;er form was ever oppo&s;ed to the abu&s;es of power. But it requires a fabric no le&s;s than the whole political con&s;titution of Great Britain, a &s;pirit no le&s;s than the refractory and turbulent zeal of this fortunate people, to &s;ecure its effects.</P>
<P>IF even the &s;a&s;ety of the per&s;on, and the te|nure of property, which may be &s;o well defined in the words of a &s;tatute, depend, for their pre&s;er|vation, on the vigour and jealou&s;y of a free peo|ple, and on the degree of con&s;ideration which e|very order of the &s;tate maintains for it&s;elf; it is &s;till more evident, that what we have called the political freedom, or the right of the individual to act in his &s;tation for him&s;elf and the public, can|not be made to re&s;t on any other foundation. The e&s;tate may be &s;aved, and the per&s;on relea&s;ed, by the forms of a civil procedure; but the rights of the mind cannot be &s;u&s;tained by any other force but its own.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Hi&s;tory of Arts.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that art is natu|ral to man; and that the &s;kill he acquires after many ages of practice, is only the improve|ment of a talent he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the fir&s;t. Vitru|vius finds the rudiments of architecture in the form of a Scythian cottage. The armourer may find the fir&s;t productions of his calling in the &s;ling and the bow; and the &s;hip-wright of his in the ca|noe of the &s;avage. Even the hi&s;torian and the poet may find the original e&s;&s;ays of their arts in the tale, and the &s;ong, which celebrate the wars, the loves, and the adventures of men in their rude&s;t condition.</P>
<P>DESTINED to cultivate his own nature, or to mend his &s;ituation, man finds a continual &s;ub|ject of attention, ingenuity, and labour. Even where he does not propo&s;e any per&s;onal improve|ment, his faculties are &s;trengthened by tho&s;e very exerci&s;es in which he &s;eems to forget him&s;elf: his rea&s;on and his affections are thus profitably engag|ed in the affairs of &s;ociety; his invention and his &s;kill are exerci&s;ed in procuring his accommodations and his food; his particular pur&s;uits are pre&s;crib|ed to him by circum&s;tances of the age and of the country in which he lives: in one &s;ituation he is occupied with wars and political deliberations; in
<PB N="252" REF="258">
another, with the care of his intere&s;t, of his per|&s;onal ea&s;e, or conveniency. He &s;uits his means to the ends he has in view; and, by multiplying con|trivances, proceeds, by degrees, to the perfection of his arts. In every &s;tep of his progre&s;s, if his &s;kill be increa&s;ed, his de&s;ire mu&s;t likewi&s;e have time to extend: and it would be as vain to &s;ugge&s;t a contrivance of which he &s;ighted the u&s;e, as it would be to tell him of ble&s;&s;ings which he could not command.</P>
<P>AGES are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have borrow|ed from tho&s;e who went before them, and nations to have derived their portion of learning or of art from abroad. The Romans are thought to have learned from the Greeks, and the moderns of Eu|rope from both. In this imagination we frequent|ly proceed &s;o far as to admit of nothing original in the practice or manners of any people. The Greek was a copy of the Egyptian, and even the Egyptian was an imitator, though we have lo&s;t &s;ight of the model on which he was formed.</P>
<P>IT is known, that men improve by example and intercour&s;e; but in the ca&s;e of nations, who&s;e members excite and direct each other, why &s;eek from abroad the origin of arts, of which every &s;ociety, having the principles in it&s;elf, only requires a favourable occa&s;ion to bring them to light? When &s;uch occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf to any people, they ge|nerally &s;eize it; and while it continues, they im|prove the inventions to which it gave ri&s;e among them&s;elves, or they willingly copy from others; but they never employ their own invention, nor look abroad, for in&s;truction on &s;ubjects that do not lie in the way of their common pur&s;uits; they ne|ver
<PB N="25" REF="259">
adopt a refinement of which they have not di&s;covered the u&s;e.</P>
<P>INVENTIONS, we frequently ob&s;erve, are acci|dental; but it is probable, that an accident which e&s;capes the arti&s;t in one age, may be &s;eized by one who &s;ucceeds him, and who is better appri&s;ed of its u&s;e. Where circum&s;tances are favourable, and where a people is intent on the objects of any art, every invention is pre&s;erved, by being brought in|to general practice; every model is &s;tudied, and every accident is turned to account. If nations actually borrow from their neighbours, they pro|bably borrow only what they are nearly in a con|dition to have invented them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ANY &s;ingular practice of one country, there|fore, is &s;eldom transferred to another, till the way be prepared by the introduction of &s;imiliar circum|&s;tances. Hence our frequent complaints of the dull|ne&s;s or ob&s;tinacy of mankind, and of the dilatory communication of arts, from one place to another. While the Romans adopted the arts of Greece, the Thracians and Illyrians continued to behold them with indifference. Tho&s;e arts were, during one period, confined to the Greek colonies, and during another, to the Roman. Even where they were &s;pread by a vi&s;ible intercour&s;e, they were &s;till received by independent nations with the &s;low|ne&s;s of invention. They made a progre&s;s not more rapid at Rome than they had done at Athens; and they pa&s;&s;ed to the extremities of the Roman empire, only in company with new colonies, and joined to Italian policy.</P>
<P>THE modern race, who came abroad to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of cultivated provinces, retained the arts
<PB N="254" REF="260">
they had practi&s;ed at home: the new ma&s;ter hunt|ed the boar, or pa&s;tured his herds, where he might have rai&s;ed a plentiful harve&s;t: he built a cottage in the view of a palace: he buried, in one com|mon ruin, the edifices, &s;culptures, paintings, and libraries, of the former inhabitant: he made a &s;ettlement upon a plan of his own, and opened anew the &s;ource of inventions, without perceiving from a di&s;tance to what length their progre&s;s might lead his po&s;terity. The cottage of the pre&s;ent race, like that of the former, by degrees enlarged its dimen&s;ions; public buildings acquired a magnifi|cence in a new ta&s;te. Even this ta&s;te came, in a cour&s;e of ages, to be exploded, and the people of Europe recurred to the models which their fathers de&s;troyed, and wept over the ruins which they could not re&s;tore.</P>
<P>THE literary remains of antiquity were &s;tudied and imitated, after the original genius of modern nations had broke forth: the rude efforts of poetry in Italy and Provence, re&s;embled tho&s;e of the Greeks and the ancient Romans. How far the merit of our works might, without the aid of their models, have ri&s;en by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive improvements, or whether we have gained more by imitation than we have lo&s;t by quitting our native &s;y&s;tem of thinking, and our vein of fable, mu&s;t be left to conjecture. We are certainly indebted to them for the materials, as well as the form, of many of our compo&s;itions; and without their example, the &s;train of our liter|ature, together with that of our manners and poli|cy, would have been different from what they at pre&s;ent are. This much however may be &s;aid with a&s;&s;urance, that although the Roman and the modern literature &s;avour alike of the Greek ori|ginal,
<PB N="255" REF="261">
yet mankind in either in&s;tance would not have drank of this fountain, unle&s;s they had been ha&s;tening to open &s;prings of their own.</P>
<P>SENTIMENT and fancy, the u&s;e of the hand or the head, are not inventions of particular men; and the flouri&s;hing of arts that depend on them, are, in the ca&s;e of any people, a proof rather of political felicity at home, than of any in&s;truction received from abroad, or of any natural &s;uperiority in point of indu&s;try or talents.</P>
<P>WHEN the attentions of men are turned to|ward particular &s;ubjects, when the acqui&s;itions of one age are left entire to the next, when every individual is protected in his place, and left to pur&s;ue the &s;ugge&s;tion of his wants, devices accu|mulate; and it is difficult to find the original of any art. The &s;teps which lead to perfection are many; and we are at a lo&s;s on whom to be&s;tow the greate&s;t &s;hare of our prai&s;e; on the fir&s;t or on the la&s;t who may have bore a part in the progre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Hi&s;tory of Literature.</HEAD>
<P>IF we may rely on the general ob&s;ervations con|tained in the la&s;t &s;ection, the literary, as well as mechanical arts, being a natural produce of the human mind, will ri&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly where-ever men are happily placed; and in certain nations it is not more nece&s;&s;ary to look abroad for the origin of literature, than it is for the &s;ugge&s;tion of any of the plea&s;ures or exerci&s;es in which mankind, under a &s;tate of pro&s;perity and freedom, are &s;uf|ficiently inclined to indulge them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE are apt to con&s;ider arts as foreign and ad|ventitious to the nature of man: but there is no art that did not find its occa&s;ion in human life, and that was not, in &s;ome one or other of the &s;ituati|ons in which our &s;pecies is found, &s;ugge&s;ted as a means for the attainment of &s;ome u&s;eful end. The mechanic and commercial arts took their ri&s;e from the love of property, and were encouraged by the pro&s;pects of &s;afety and of gain: the literary and liberal arts took their ri&s;e from the under&s;tanding, the fancy and the heart. They are mere exerci|&s;es of the mind in &s;earch of its peculiar plea&s;ures and occupations; and are promoted by circum|&s;tances that &s;uffer the mind to enjoy it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="263">
MEN are equally engaged by the pa&s;t, the pre&s;ent, and the future, and are prepared for every occupation that gives &s;cope to their powers. Pro|ductions therefore, whether of narration, fiction, or rea&s;oning, that tend to employ the imagination, or move the heart, continue for ages a &s;ubject of attention, and a &s;ource of delight. The memory of human tran&s;actions being pre&s;erved in tradition or writing, is the natural gratification of a pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;i&s;ts of curio&s;ity, admiration, and the love of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>BEFORE many books are written, and before &s;cience is greatly advanced, the productions of mere genius are &s;ometimes complete: the perform|er requires not the aid of learning where his de|&s;cription or &s;tory relates to near and contiguous objects; where it relates to the conduct and cha|racters of men with whom he him&s;elf has acted, and in who&s;e occupations and fortunes he him&s;elf has borne a part.</P>
<P>WITH this advantage, the poet is the fir&s;t to offer the fruits of his genius, and to lead in the career of tho&s;e arts by which the mind is de&s;tined to exhibit its imaginations, and to expre&s;s its pa&s;|&s;ions. Every tribe of barbarians have their pa&s;|&s;ionate or hi&s;toric rhymes, which contain the &s;u|per&s;tition, the enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the admiration of glory, with which the brea&s;ts of men, in the ear|lie&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. They delight in ver&s;e-compo&s;itions, either becau&s;e the cadence of numbers is natural to the language of &s;entiment, or becau&s;e, not having the advantage of writing, they are obliged to bring the ear in aid of the me|mory,
<PB N="258" REF="264">
in order to facilitate the repetition, and in|&s;ure the pre&s;ervation of their works.</P>
<P>WHEN we attend to the language which &s;a|vages employ on any &s;olemn occa&s;ion, it appears that man is a poet by nature. Whether at fir&s;t obliged by the mere defects of his tongue, and the &s;cantine&s;s of proper expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;educed by a plea&s;ure of the fancy in &s;tating the analogy of its objects, he clothes every conception in image and metaphor. <Q>We have planted the tree of peace,</Q> &s;ays an American orator;
<Q>we have buried the axe under its roots: we will henceforth repo&s;e under its &s;hade; we will join to brighten the chain that binds our nations together.</Q>
Such are the collections of metaphor which tho&s;e nations employ in their public harangues. They have like|wi&s;e already adopted tho&s;e lively figures, and that daring freedom of language, which the learned have afterwards found &s;o well fitted to expre&s;s the rapid tran&s;itions of the imagination, and the ar|dours of a pa&s;&s;ionate mind.</P>
<P>IF we are required to explain, how men could be poets, or orators, before they were aided by the learning of the &s;cholar and the critic? we may in|quire, in our turn, how bodies could fall by their weight, before the laws of gravitation were re|corded in books? Mind, as well as body, has laws, which are exemplified in the practice of men, and which the critic collects only after the example has &s;hewn what they are.</P>
<P>OCCASIONED, probably, by the phy&s;ical con|nection we have mentioned, between the emotions of a heated imagination, and the impre&s;&s;ions re|ceived
<PB N="259" REF="265">
from mu&s;ic and pathetic &s;ounds, every tale among rude nations is repeated in ver&s;e, and is made to take the form of a &s;ong. The early hi&s;|tory of all nations is uniform in this particular. Prie&s;ts, &s;tate&s;men, and philo&s;ophers, in the fir&s;t ages of Greece, delivered their in&s;tructions in po|etry, and mixed with the dealers in mu&s;ic and he|roic fable.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, however, that poetry &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;pecies of compo&s;ition in every nation, as it is, that a &s;tyle apparently &s;o difficult, and &s;o far removed from ordinary u&s;e, &s;hould be almo&s;t as univer&s;ally the fir&s;t to attain its maturi|ty. The mo&s;t admired of all poets lived beyond the reach of hi&s;tory, almo&s;t of tradition. The art|le&s;s &s;ong of the &s;avage, the heroic legend of the bard, have &s;ometimes a magnificent beauty, which no change of language can improve, and no re|finements of the critic reform.</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;advantage of a limited knowledge, and a rude apprehen&s;ion, the &s;imple poet has impre&s;&s;ions that more than compen&s;ate the defects of his &s;kill. The be&s;t &s;ubjects of poe|try, the characters of the violent and the brave, the generous and the intrepid, great dangers, trials of fortitude and fidelity, are exhibited within his view, or are delivered in traditions which animate like truth, becau&s;e they are equally believed. He is not engaged in recalling, like Virgil or Ta&s;&s;o, the &s;entiments or &s;cenery of an age remote from his own: he needs not be told by the critic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Longinus.</NOTE>, to
<PB N="260" REF="266">
recollect what another would have have thought, or in what manner another would have expre&s;&s;ed his conception. The &s;imple pa&s;&s;ions, friend&s;hip, re&s;entment, and love, are the movements of his own mind, and he has no occa&s;ion to copy. Sim|ple and vehement in his conceptions and feelings, he knows no diver&s;ity of thought, or of &s;tyle, to mi&s;lead or to exerci&s;e his judgement. He delivers the emotions of the heart, in words &s;ugge&s;ted by the heart: for he knows no other. And hence it is, that while we admire the judgement and inven|tion of Virgil, and of other later poets, the&s;e terms appear mi&s;applied to Homer. Though intelligent, as well as &s;ublime, in his conceptions, we cannot anticipate the lights of his under&s;tanding, nor the movements of his heart: he appears to &s;peak from in&s;piration, not from invention; and to be guided in the choice of his thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions by a &s;upernatural in&s;tinct, not by reflection.</P>
<P>THE language of early ages, is in one re&s;pect, &s;imple and confined; in another, it is varied and free: it allows liberties, which, to the poet of after times, are denied.</P>
<P>IN rude ages men are not &s;eparated by di&s;tinc|tions of rank or profe&s;&s;ion. They live in one manner, and &s;peak one dialect. The bard is not to chu&s;e his expre&s;&s;ion among the &s;ingular accents of different conditions. He has not to guard his language from the peculiar errors of the mecha|nic, the pea&s;ant, the &s;cholar, or the courtier, in order to find that elegant propriety, and ju&s;t ele|vation, which is free from the vulgar of one cla&s;s, the pedantic of the &s;econd, or the flippant of the third. The name of every object, and of every
<PB N="261" REF="267">
&s;entiment, is fixed; and if his conception has the dignity of nature, his expre&s;&s;ion will have a purity which does not depend on his choice.</P>
<P>WITH this apparent confinement in the choice of his words, he is at liberty to break through the ordinary modes of con&s;truction; and in the form of a language not e&s;tabli&s;hed by rules, may find for him&s;elf a cadence agreeable to the tone of his mind. The liberty he takes, while his meaning is &s;triking, and his language is rai&s;ed, appears an improvement, not a tre&s;pa&s;s on grammar. He de|livers a &s;tyle to the ages that follow, and becomes a model from which his po&s;terity judge.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may be the early di&s;po&s;ition of mankind to poetry, or the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;s in cultivating this &s;pecies of literature; whether the early maturity of poetical compo&s;itions ari&s;e from their being the fir&s;t &s;tudied, or from their having a charm to engage per&s;ons of the livelie&s;t genius, who are be&s;t qualified to improve the elo|quence of their native tongue; it is a remarkable fact, that, not only in countries where every vein of compo&s;ition was original, and was opened in the order of natural &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but even at Rome, and in modern Europe, where the learned began early to practi&s;e on foreign models, we have poets of every nation, who are peru&s;ed with plea&s;ure, while the pro&s;e writers of the &s;ame ages are neg|lected.</P>
<P>AS Sophocles and Euripides preceded the hi&s;to|rians and morali&s;ts of Greece, not only Naevius and Ennius, who wrote the Roman hi&s;tory in ver&s;e, but Lucilius, Plautus, Terence, and we
<PB N="262" REF="268">
may add Lucretius, were prior to Cicero, Sallu&s;t, or Cae&s;ar. Dante and Petrarch went before any good pro&s;e writer in Italy; Corneille and Racine brought on the fine age of pro&s;e compo&s;itions in France; and we had in England, not only Chaucer and Spencer, but Shake&s;pear and Milton, while our attempts in hi&s;tory or &s;cience were yet in their infancy; and de&s;erve our attention, only for the &s;ake of the matter they treat.</P>
<P>HILLANICUS, who is reckoned among the fir&s;t pro&s;e writers in Greece, and who immediately preceded, or was the contemporary of Herodotus, &s;et out with declaring his intention to remove from hi&s;tory the wild repre&s;entations, and extravagant fictions, with which it had been di&s;graced by the poets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quoted by Demetrius Phalerius.</NOTE>. The want of records or authorities, re|lating to any di&s;tant tran&s;actions, may have hin|dered him, as it did his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or, from giving truth all the advantage it might have reaped from this tran&s;ition to pro&s;e. There are, however, ages in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, when &s;uch a propo&s;ition mu&s;t be favourably received. When men become occupied on the &s;ubjects of policy, or commercial arts, they wi&s;h to be in|formed and in&s;tructed, as well as moved. They are intere&s;ted by what was real in pa&s;t tran&s;actions. They build on this foundation, the reflections and rea&s;onings they apply to pre&s;ent affairs, and wi&s;h to receive information on the &s;ubject of different pur&s;uits, and of projects in which they begin to be engaged. The manners of men, the practice of ordinary life, and the form of &s;ociety, furni&s;h
<PB N="263" REF="269">
their &s;ubjects to the moral and political writer. Mere ingenuity, ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment, and correct repre&s;entation, though conveyed in ordinary lan|guage, are under&s;tood to con&s;titute literary merit, and by applying to rea&s;on more than to the ima|gination and pa&s;&s;ions, meet with a reception that is due to the in&s;truction they bring.</P>
<P>THE talents of men come to be employed in a variety of affairs, and their inquiries directed to different &s;ubjects. Knowledge is important in every department of civil &s;ociety, and requi&s;ite to the practice of every art. The &s;cience of na|ture, morals, politics, and hi&s;tory, find their &s;e|veral admirers; and even poetry it&s;elf which re|tains its former &s;tation in the region of warm ima|gination and enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion, appears in a growing variety of forms.</P>
<P>MATTERS have proceeded &s;o far, without the aid of foreign examples, or the direction of &s;chools. The cart of The&s;pia was changed into a theatre, not to gratify the learned, but to plea&s;e the Athenian populace: and the prize of poetical merit was decided by this populace equally before and after the invention of rules. The Greeks were unacquainted with every language but their own; and if they became learned, it was only by &s;tudying what they them&s;elves had produced: the childi&s;h mythology, which they are &s;aid to have copied from A&s;ia, was equally of little avail in promoting their love of arts, or their &s;ucce&s;s in the practice of them.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="270">
WHEN the hi&s;torian is &s;truck with the events he has witne&s;&s;ed, or heard; when he is excited to relate them by his reflections or his pa&s;&s;ions; when the &s;tate&s;man, who is required to &s;peak in public, is obliged to prepare for every remarkable appear|ance in &s;tudied harangues; when conver&s;ation be|comes exten&s;ive and refined; and when the &s;ocial feelings and reflections of men are committed to writing, a &s;y&s;tem of learning may ari&s;e from the bu&s;tle of an active life. Society it&s;elf is the &s;chool, and its le&s;&s;ons are delivered in the practice of real affairs. An author writes from ob&s;ervations he has made on his &s;ubject, not from the &s;ugge&s;tion of books; and every production carries the mark of his character as a man, not of his mere proficiency as a &s;tudent or &s;cholar. It may be made a que&s;tion, whether the trouble of &s;eeking for di&s;tant models and of wading for in&s;truction, through dark allu|&s;ions and languages unknown, might not have quenched his fire, and rendered him a writer of a very inferior cla&s;s.</P>
<P>IF &s;ociety may thus be con&s;idered as a &s;chool for letters, it is probable that its le&s;&s;ons are varied in every &s;eparate &s;tate, and in every age. For a certain period, the &s;evere applications of the Ro|man people to policy and war &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the lite|rary arts, and appear to have &s;tifled the genius even of the hi&s;torian and the poet. The in&s;titutions of Sparta gave a profe&s;&s;ed contempt for whatever was not connected with the practical virtues of a vigorous and re&s;olute &s;pirit: the charms of ima|gination, and the parade of language, were by this people cla&s;&s;ed with the arts of the cook and the
<PB N="265" REF="271">
perfumer: their &s;ongs in prai&s;e of fortitude are mentioned by &s;ome writers; and collections of their witty &s;ayings and repartees are &s;till pre&s;erved: they indicate the virtues and the abilities of an ac|tive people, not their proficiency in &s;cience or lite|rary ta&s;te. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what was e&s;&s;ential to hap|pine&s;s in the virtues of the heart, they had a di&s;|cernment of its value, unimbarra&s;&s;ed by the num|berle&s;s objects on which mankind in general are &s;o much at a lo&s;s to adju&s;t their e&s;teem: fixed in their own apprehen&s;ion, they turned a &s;harp edge on the follies of mankind.
<Q>When will you be|gin to practi&s;e?</Q>
was the que&s;tion of a Spartan to a per&s;on, who, in an anvanced age of life, was &s;till occupied with que&s;tions on the nature of vir|tue.</P>
<P>WHILE this people confined their &s;tudies to one que&s;tion, How to improve and to pre&s;erve the courage and the di&s;intere&s;ted affections of the hu|man heart? their rivals the Athenians gave a &s;cope to refinement on every object of reflection or pa&s;&s;ion. By the rewards, either of profit or of reputation, which they be&s;towed on every effort of ingenuity employed in mini&s;tering to the plea&s;ure, the decoration, or the conveniency of life; by the variety of conditions in which their citizens were placed; by their inequalities of fortune, and their &s;everal pur&s;uits in war, politics, commerce, and lucrative arts, they awakened whatever was either good or bad in the natural di&s;po&s;itions of men. Every road to eminence was opened: eloquence, fortitude, military &s;kill, envy, detraction, faction, and trea&s;on, even the mu&s;e her&s;elf, was courted to be&s;tow importance among a bu&s;y, acute, and tur|bulent people.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="272">
FROM this example, we may &s;afely conclude, that although bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;ometimes a rival to &s;tudy, retirement and lei&s;ure are not the principal requi&s;ites to the improvement, perhaps not even to the exerci&s;e, of literary talents. The mo&s;t &s;trik|ing exertions of imagination and &s;entiment have a reference to mankind: they are excited by the pre|&s;ence and intercour&s;e of men: they have mo&s;t vi|gour when actuated in the mind by the operation of its principal &s;prings, by the emulations, the friend&s;hips, and the oppo&s;itions, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t a|mong a forward and a&s;piring people. Amid&s;t the great occa&s;ions which put a free, and even a licen|tious, &s;ociety in motion, its members become ca|pable of every exertion; and the &s;ame &s;cenes which gave employment to Themi&s;tocles and Thra&s;ybulus, in&s;pired, by contagion, the genius of Sophocles and Plato. The petulant and the inge|nuous find an equal &s;cope to their talents; and li|terary monuments become the repo&s;itories of envy and folly, as well as of wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P>GREECE, divided into many little &s;tates, and agitated, beyond any &s;pot on the globe, by do|me&s;tic contentions and foreign wars, &s;et the exam|ple in every &s;pecies of literature. The fire was communicated to Rome; not when the &s;tate cea&s;ed to be warlike, and had di&s;continued her po|litical agitations, but when &s;he mixed the love of refinement and of plea&s;ure with her national pur|&s;uits, and indulged an inclination to &s;tudy in the mid&s;t of ferments, occa&s;ioned by the wars and preten&s;ions of oppo&s;ite factions. It was revived in modern Europe among the turbulent &s;tates of
<PB N="267" REF="273">
Italy, and &s;pread to the North, together with the &s;pirit which &s;hook the fabric of the Gothic policy; it ro&s;e while men were divided into parties, under civil or religious denominations, and when they were at variance on &s;ubjects held the mo&s;t important and &s;acred.</P>
<P>WE may be &s;atisfied, from the example of many ages, that liberal endowments be&s;towed on learned &s;ocieties, and the lei&s;ure with which they were furni&s;hed for &s;tudy, are not the likelie&s;t means to excite the exertions of genius: even &s;ci|ence it&s;elf, the &s;uppo&s;ed offspring of lei&s;ure, pined in the &s;hade of mona&s;tic retirement. Men at a di&s;tance from the objects of u&s;eful knowledge, un|touched by the motives that animate an active and a vigorous mind, could produce only the jar|gon of a technical language, and accumulate the impertinence of accademical forms.</P>
<P>TO &s;peak or to write ju&s;tly from an ob&s;erva|tion of nature, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have felt the &s;en|timents of nature. He who is penetrating and ardent in the conduct of life, will probably exert a proportional force and ingenuity in the exerci&s;e of his literary talents: and although writing may become a trade, and require all the application and &s;tudy which are be&s;towed on any other calling; yet the principal requi&s;ites in this calling are, the &s;pirit and &s;en&s;ibility of a vigorous mind.</P>
<P>IN one period, the &s;chool may take its light and direction from active life; in another, it is true, the remains of an active &s;pirit are greatly &s;upported by literary monuments, and by the hi&s;|tory
<PB N="268" REF="274">
of tran&s;actions that pre&s;erve the examples and the experience of former and of better times. But in whatever manner men are formed for great ef|forts of elocution or conduct, it appears the mo&s;t glaring of all other deceptions, to look for the ac|compli&s;hments of a human character in the mere attainments of &s;peculation, whil&s;t we neglect the qualities of fortitude and public affection, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to render our knowledge an article of happine&s;s or of u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the Separation of Arts and Profe&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident, that, however urged by a &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and a de&s;ire of convenience, or fa|voured by any advantages of &s;ituation and po|licy, a people can make no great progre&s;s in cul|tivating the arts of life, until they have &s;eparated, and committed to different per&s;ons, the &s;everal ta&s;ks, which require a peculiar &s;kill and attention. The &s;avage, or the barbarian, who mu&s;t build and plant, and fabricate for him&s;elf, prefers in the in|terval of great alarms and fatigues, the enjoyments of &s;loth to the improvement of his fortune: he is,
<PB N="270" REF="276">
perhaps, by the diver&s;ity of his wants, di&s;couraged from indu&s;try; or, by his divided attention, pre|vented from acquiring &s;kill in the management of any particular &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE enjoyment of peace, however, and the pro&s;pect of being able to exchange one commo|dity for another, turns by degrees, the hunter and the warrior into a trade&s;man and a merchant. The accidents which di&s;tribute the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence unequally, inclination, and favourable opportuni|ties, a&s;&s;ign the different occupations of men; and a &s;en&s;e of utility leads them, without end, to &s;ub|divide their profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE arti&s;t finds, that the more he can confine his attention to a particular part of any work, his productions are the more perfect, and grow under his hands in the greater quantities. Every under|taker in manufacture finds, that the more he can &s;ubdivide the ta&s;ks of his workmen, and the more hands he can employ on &s;eparate articles, the more are his expences dimini&s;hed, and his profits in|crea&s;ed. The con&s;umer too requires, in every kind of commodity, a workman&s;hip more perfect than hands employed on a variety of &s;ubjects can produce; and the progre&s;s of commerce is but a continued &s;ubdivi&s;ion of the mechanical arts.</P>
<P>EVERY craft may ingro&s;s the whole of a man's attention, and has a my&s;tery which mu&s;t be &s;tu|died or learned by a regular apprentice&s;hip. Na|tions of trade&s;men come to con&s;i&s;t of members who, beyond their own particular trade, are ignorant of all human affairs, and who may contribute to the pre&s;ervation and enlargement of their common|wealth
<PB N="271" REF="277">
without making its intere&s;t an object of their regard or attention. Every individual is di|&s;tingui&s;hed by his calling, and has a place to which he is fitted. The &s;avage who knows no di&s;tincti|on but that of his merit, of his &s;ex, or of his &s;pe|cies, and to whom his community is the &s;overeign object of his affection, is a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that in a &s;cene of this nature, his being a man does not qualify him for any &s;tation whatever: he flies to the woods with amazement, di&s;ta&s;te, and aver|&s;ion.</P>
<P>BY the &s;eparation of arts and profe&s;&s;ions, the &s;ources of wealth are laid open; every &s;pecies of material is wrought up to the greate&s;t perfection, and every commodity is produced in the greate&s;t abundance. The &s;tate may e&s;timate its profits and its revenues by the number of its people. It may procure, by its trea&s;ure, that national con&s;ideration and power, which the &s;avage maintains at the ex|pence of his blood.</P>
<P>THE advantage gained in the inferior branches of manufacture by the &s;eparation of their parts, &s;eem to be equalled by tho&s;e which ari&s;e from a &s;imilar device in the higher departments of policy and war. The &s;oldier is relieved from every care but that of his &s;ervice; &s;tate&s;men divide the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of civil government into &s;hares; and the &s;er|vants of the public, in every office, without be|ing &s;kilful in the affairs of &s;tate, may &s;ucceed, by ob&s;erving forms which are already e&s;tabli&s;hed on the experience of others. They are made, like the parts of an engine, to concur to a purpo&s;e, with|out any concert of their own: and, equally blind with the trader to any general combination, they
<PB N="272" REF="278">
unite with him, in furni&s;hing to the &s;tate its re|&s;ources, its conduct, and its force.</P>
<P>THE artifices of the beaver, the ant, and the bee, are a&s;cribed to the wi&s;dom of nature. Tho&s;e of poli&s;hed Nations are a&s;cribed to them&s;elves, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to indicate a capacity &s;uperior to that of rude minds. But the e&s;tabli&s;hments of men, like tho&s;e of every animal, are &s;ugge&s;ted by nature, and are the re&s;ult of in&s;tinct, directed by the variety of &s;ituations in which mankind are placed. Tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments aro&s;e from &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive improvements that were made, without any &s;en&s;e of their general effect; and they bring hu|man affairs to a &s;tate of complication, which the greate&s;t reach of capacity with which human na|ture was ever adorned, could not have projected; nor even when the whole is carried into execution, can it be comprehended in its full extent.</P>
<P>WHO could anticipate, or even enumerate, the &s;eparate occupations and profe&s;&s;ions by which the members of any commercial &s;tate are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; the variety of devices which are practi&s;ed in &s;eparate cells, and which the arti&s;t, attentive to his own affair, has invented, to abridge or to facili|tate his &s;eparate ta&s;k? In coming to this mighty end, every generation, compared to its predece&s;|&s;ors, may have appeared to be ingenious; com|pared to its followers, may have appeared to be dull: and human ingenuity, whatever heights it may have gained in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, continues to move with an equal pace, and to creep in making the la&s;t as well as the fir&s;t &s;tep of com|mercial or civil improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="279">
IT may even be doubted, whether the mea&s;ure of national capacity increa&s;es with the advance|ment of arts. Many mechanical arts, indeed, re|quire no capacity; they &s;ucceed be&s;t under a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment and rea&s;on; and ignorance is the mother of indu&s;try as well as of &s;uper&s;tition. Reflection and fancy are &s;ubject to err; but a habit of moving the hand, or the foot, is inde|pendent of either. Manufactures, accordingly, pro&s;per mo&s;t, where the mind is lea&s;t con&s;ulted, and where the work&s;hop may, without any great effort of imagination, be con&s;idered as an engine, the parts of which are men.</P>
<P>THE fore&s;t has been felled by the &s;avage with|out the u&s;e of the axe, and weights have been rai&s;ed without the aid of the mechanical powers. The merit of the inventor, in every branch, pro|bably de&s;erves a preference to that of the perfor|mer; and he who invented a tool, or could work without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, de&s;erved the prai&s;e of inge|nuity in a much higher degree than the mere ar|ti&s;t, who, by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, produces a &s;uperior work.</P>
<P>BUT if many parts in the practice of every art, and in the detail of every department, require no abilities, or actually tend to contract and to limit the views of the mind, there are others which lead to general reflections, and to enlargement of thought. Even in manufacture, the genius of the ma&s;ter, perhaps, is cultivated, while that of the inferior workman lies wa&s;te. The &s;tate&s;man may have a wide comprehen&s;ion of human affairs, while the tools he employs are ignorant of the &s;y&s;tem in which they are them&s;elves combined. The ge|neral
<PB N="274" REF="280">
officer may be a great proficient in the know|ledge of war, while the &s;oldier is confined to a few motions of the hand and the foot. The for|mer may have gained, what the latter has lo&s;t; and being occupied in the conduct of di&s;ciplined armies, may practi&s;e on a larger &s;cale, all the arts of pre&s;ervation, of deception, and of &s;tratagem, which the &s;avage exerts in leading a &s;mall party, or merely in defending him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE practitioner of every art and profe&s;&s;ion may afford matter of general &s;peculation to the man of &s;cience; and thinking it&s;elf, in this age of &s;eparations, may become a peculiar craft. In the bu&s;tle of civil pur&s;uits and occupations, men appear in a variety of lights, and &s;ugge&s;t matter of inquiry and fancy, by which conver&s;ation is enlivened, and greatly enlarged. The productions of ingenuity are brought to the market; and men are willing to pay for whatever has a tendency to inform or amu&s;e. By this means the idle, as well as the bu&s;y, contribute to forward the progre&s;s of arts, and be&s;tow on poli&s;hed nations that air of &s;uperior ingenuity, under which they appear to have gained the ends that were pur&s;ued by the &s;a+vage in his fore&s;t, knowledge, order, and wealth.</P>

<P>THERE is an elevation natural to man, by which he would be thought, in his rude&s;t &s;tate, however urged by nece&s;&s;ity, to ri&s;e above the con|&s;ideration of mere &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the regards of intere&s;ts: He would appear to act only from the heart, in its engagements of friend&s;hip, or oppo|&s;ition; he would &s;hew him&s;elf only upon occa&s;ions of danger or difficulty, and leave ordinary cares to the weak or the &s;ervile.</P>

THE &s;ame apprehen&s;ions, in every &s;ituation, regulate his notions of meanne&s;s or of dignity. In that of poli&s;hed &s;ociety, his de&s;ire to avoid the character of &s;ordid, makes him conceal his re|gard for what relates merely to his pre&s;ervation or his livelihood. In his e&s;timation, the beggar, who depends upon charity; the labourer, who toils that he may eat; the mechanic, who&s;e art requires no exertion of genius, are degraded by the object they pur&s;ue, and by the means they employ to attain it. Profe&s;&s;ions requiring more knowledge and &s;tudy; proceeding on the exerci&s;e of fancy, and the love of perfection; leading to applau&s;e as well as to profit, place the arti&s;t in a &s;uperior cla&s;s, and bring him nearer to that &s;tation in which men are &s;uppo&s;ed to be highe&s;t; becau&s;e in it they are bound to no ta&s;k; becau&s;e they are left to fol|low the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, and to take that part in &s;ociety, to which they are led by the &s;en|timents of the heart, or by the calls of the public.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t was the &s;tation, which, in the di|&s;tinction betwixt freemen and &s;laves, the citizens of every ancient republic &s;trove to gain, and to maintain for them&s;elves. Women, or &s;laves, in the earlie&s;t ages, had been &s;et apart for the pur|po&s;es of dome&s;tic care, or bodily labour; and in the progre&s;s of lucrative arts, the latter were bred to mechanical profe&s;&s;ions, and were even intru&s;ted with merchandi&s;e for the benefit of their ma&s;ters. Freemen would be under&s;tood to have no object be&s;ide tho&s;e of politics and war. In this manner, the honours of one half of the &s;pecies were &s;acri|ficed to tho&s;e of the other; as &s;tones from the &s;ame quarry are buried in the foundation, to &s;u&s;|tain
<PB N="277" REF="283">
the blocks which happen to be hewn for the &s;uperior parts of the pile. In the mid&s;t of our encomiums be&s;towed on the Greeks and the Ro|mans, we are, by this circum&s;tance, made to re|member, that no human in&s;titution is perfect.</P>
<P>IN many of the Grecian &s;tates, the benefits a|ri&s;ing to the free from this cruel di&s;tinction, were not conferred equally on all the citizens. Wealth being unequally divided, the rich alone were ex|empted from labour; the poor were reduced to work for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: intere&s;t was a reigning pa&s;&s;ion in both, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;laves, like that of any other lucrative property, became an object of avarice, not an exemption from &s;ordid attentions. The entire effects of the in&s;titution were obtained, or continued to be enjoyed for any con&s;iderable time, at Sparta alone. We feel its inju&s;tice; we &s;uffer for the helot, under the &s;eve|rities and unequal treatment to which he was ex|po&s;ed: but when we think only of the &s;uperior order of men in this &s;tate; when we attend to that elevation and magnanimity of &s;pirit, for which danger had no terror, intere&s;t no means to corrupt; when we con&s;ider them as friends, or as citizens, we are apt to forget, like them&s;elves, that &s;laves have a title to be treated like men.</P>
<P>WE look for elevation of &s;entiment, and libe|rality of mind, among tho&s;e orders of citizens, who, by their condition, and their fortunes, are relieved from &s;ordid cares and attentions. This was the de&s;cription of a free man at Sparta; and if the lot of a &s;lave among the ancients was really more wretched than that of the indigent labourer and the mechanic among the moderns, it may be
<PB N="278" REF="284">
doubted, whether the &s;uperior orders, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of con&s;ideration and honours, do not pro|portionally fail in the dignity which befits their condition. If the preten&s;ions to equal ju&s;tice and freedom &s;hould terminate in rendering every cla&s;s equally &s;ervile and mercenary, we make a nation of helots, and have no free citizens.</P>
<P>IN every commercial &s;tate, notwith&s;tanding any preten&s;ion to equal rights, the exaltation of a few mu&s;t depre&s;s the many. In this arrangement, we think that the extreme meanne&s;s of &s;ome cla&s;&s;es mu&s;t ari&s;e chiefly from the defect of knowledge, and of liberal education; and we refer to &s;uch cla&s;&s;es, as to an image of what our &s;pecies mu&s;t have been in its rude and uncultivated &s;tate. But we forget how many circum&s;tances, e&s;pecially in populous cities, tend to corrupt the lowe&s;t orders of men. Ignorance is the lea&s;t of their failings. An admiration of wealth unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, becoming a principle of envy, or of &s;ervility; a habit of act|ing perpetually with a view to profit, and under a &s;en&s;e of &s;ubjection; the crimes to which they are allured, in order to feed their debauch, or to gra|tify their avarice, are examples, not of ignorance, but of corruption and ba&s;ene&s;s. If the &s;avage has not received our in&s;tructions, he is likewi&s;e unac|quainted with our vices. He knows no &s;uperior, and cannot be &s;ervile; he knows no di&s;tinctions of fortune, and cannot be envious; he acts from his talents in the highe&s;t &s;tation which human &s;ociety can offer, that of the coun&s;ellor, and the &s;oldier of his country. Toward forming his &s;entiments, he knows all that the heart requires to be known; he can di&s;tingui&s;h the friend whom he loves, and the public intere&s;t which awakens his zeal.</P>

THE principal objections to democratical or popular government, are taken from the inequali|ties which ari&s;e among men in the re&s;ult of com|mercial arts. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that po|pular a&s;&s;emblies, when compo&s;ed of men who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions are &s;ordid, and who&s;e ordinary appli|cations are illiberal, however they may be in|tru&s;ted with the choice of their ma&s;ters and leaders, are certainly, in their own per&s;ons, unfit to com|mand. How can he who has confined his views to his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or pre&s;ervation, be intru&s;ted with the conduct of nations? Such men, when admitted to deliberate on matters of &s;tate, bring to its councils confu&s;ion and tumult, or &s;ervility and corruption; and &s;eldom &s;uffer it to repo&s;e from ruinous factions, or the effect of re&s;olutions ill formed or ill conducted.</P>
<P>THE Athenians retained their popular govern|ment under all the&s;e defects. The mechanic was obliged, under a penalty, to appear in the pub|lic market-place, and to hear debates on the &s;ub|jects of war, and of peace. He was tempted by pecuniary rewards, to attend on the trial of civil and criminal cau&s;es. But notwith&s;tanding an exer|ci&s;e tending &s;o much to cultivate their talents, the indigent came always with minds intent upon pro|fit, or with the habits of an illiberal calling. Sunk under the &s;en&s;e of their per&s;onal di&s;parity and weakne&s;s, they were ready to re&s;ign them&s;elves entirely to the influence of &s;ome popular leader, who flattered their pa&s;&s;ions, and wrought on their &s;ears; or, actuated by envy, they were ready to bani&s;h from the &s;tate whom&s;oever was re&s;pectable and eminent in the &s;uperior order of citizens:

and whether from their neglect of the public at one time, or their male-admini&s;tration at another, the &s;overeignty was every moment ready to drop from their hands.</P>
<P>THE people, in this ca&s;e, are, in fact, fre|quently governed by one, or a few, who know how to conduct them.

<HEAD>Of the Manners of Poli&s;hed and Commercial Nations.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND, when in their rude &s;tate, have a great uniformity of manners; but when civilized, they are engaged in a variety of pur&s;uits; they tread on a larger field, and &s;eparate to a greater di&s;tance. If they be guided, however, by &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions, and by like &s;ugge&s;tions of na|ture, they will probably, in the end, as well as in the beginning of their progre&s;s, continue to a|gree in many particulars; and while communities admit, in their members, that diver&s;ity of ranks and profe&s;&s;ions which we have already de&s;cribed, as the con&s;equence or the foundation of commerce, they will re&s;emble each other in many effects of this di&s;tribution, and of other circum&s;tances in which they nearly concur.</P>
<P>UNDER every form of government, &s;tate&s;men endeavour to remove the dangers by which they are threatened from abroad, and the di&s;turbances which mole&s;t them at home. By this conduct, if &s;ucce&s;sful, they in a few ages gain an a&s;cendant for their country; e&s;tabli&s;h a frontier at a di&s;tance from its capital; they find, in the mutual de&s;ires of tranquility, which come to po&s;&s;e&s;s mankind, and in tho&s;e public e&s;tabli&s;hments which tend to keep the peace of &s;ociety, a re&s;pite from foreign wars, and a relief from dome&s;tic di&s;orders. They
<PB N="282" REF="288">
learn to decide every conte&s;t without tumult, and to &s;ecure, by the authority of law, every citizen in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his per&s;onal rights.</P>
<P>IN this condition, to which thriving nations a&s;pire, and which they in &s;ome mea&s;ure attain, mankind having laid the ba&s;is of &s;afety, proceed to erect a &s;uper&s;tructure &s;uitable to their views. The con&s;equence is various in different &s;tates; even in different orders of men of the &s;ame community; and the effect to every individual corre&s;ponds with his &s;tation. It enables the &s;tate&s;man and the &s;ol|dier to &s;ettle the forms of their different procedure; it enables the practitioner in every profe&s;&s;ion to pur|&s;ue his &s;eparate advantage; it affords the man of plea&s;ure a time for refinement, and the &s;peculative, lei&s;ure for literary conver&s;ation or &s;tudy.</P>
<P>IN this &s;cene, matters that have little reference to the active pur&s;uits of mankind, are made &s;ub|jects of enquiry, and the exerci&s;e of &s;entiment and rea&s;on it&s;elf becomes a profe&s;&s;ion. The &s;ongs of the bard, the harangues of the &s;tate&s;man and the warrior, the tradition and the &s;tory of ancient times, are con&s;idered as the models, or the earlie&s;t production, of &s;o many arts, which it becomes the object of different profe&s;&s;ions to copy or to improve. The works of fancy, like the &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory, are di&s;tingui&s;hed into cla&s;&s;es and &s;pecies; the rules of every particular kind are di&s;tinctly collected; and the library is &s;tored, like the warehou&s;e, with the fini&s;hed manufacture of different arts, who, with the aids of the gram|marian and the critic, a&s;pire, each in his particular way, to in&s;truct the head, or to move the heart.</P>

EVERY nation is a motley a&s;&s;emblage of diffe|rent characters, and contains, under any political form, &s;ome examples of that variety, which the humours, tempers, and apprehen&s;ions of men, &s;o differently employed, are likely to furni&s;h. Every profe&s;&s;ion has its point of honour, and its &s;y&s;tem of manners; the merchant his punctuality and fair dealing; the &s;tate&s;man his capacity and addre&s;s; the man of &s;ociety, his good breeding and wit. Every &s;tation has a carriage, a dre&s;s, a ceremonial, by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed, and by which it &s;up|pre&s;&s;es the national character under that of the rank, or of the individual.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;cription may be applied equally to Athens and Rome, to London and Paris.

The air of the per&s;on, the tone of the voice, the idiom of lan|guage, and the &s;train of conver&s;ation, whether pa|thetic or languid, gay or &s;evere, are no longer the &s;ame.</P>

MANY &s;uch differences may ari&s;e among po|li&s;hed nations, from the effects of climate, or from &s;ources of fa&s;hion, that are &s;till more unaccount|able and ob&s;cure; but the principal di&s;tinctions on which we can re&s;t, are derived from the part a people are obliged to act in their national ca|pacity; from the objects placed in their view by the &s;tate; or from the con&s;titution of govern|ment, which pre&s;cribing the terms of &s;ociety to its &s;ubjects, has a great influence in forming their ap|prehen&s;ions and habits.</P>
<P>THE Roman people, de&s;tined to acquire wealth by conque&s;t, and by the &s;poil of provinces; the Carthaginians, intent on the returns of merchan|di&s;e, and the produce of commercial &s;ettlements, mu&s;t have filled the &s;treets of their &s;everal capi|tals with men of a different di&s;po&s;ition and a&s;pect. The Roman laid hold of his &s;word when he wi&s;h|ed to be great, and the &s;tate found her armies prepared in the dwellings of her people. The Carthaginian retired to his counter on a &s;imilar project; and, when the &s;tate was alarmed, or had re&s;olved on a war, lent of his profits to purcha&s;e an army abroad.</P>
<P>THE member of a republic, and the &s;ubject of a monarchy, mu&s;t differ; becau&s;e they have different parts a&s;&s;igned to them by the forms of their country: the one de&s;tined to live with his equals, or, by his per&s;onal talents and character, to contend for pre-eminence; the other born to a determinate &s;tation, where any pretence to e|quality creates a confu&s;ion, and where nought but precedence is &s;tudied. Each, when the in&s;tituti|ons
<PB N="285" REF="291">
of his country are mature, may find in the laws a protection to his per&s;onal rights; but tho&s;e rights them&s;elves are differently under&s;tood, and with a different &s;et of opinions, give ri&s;e to a dif|ferent temper of mind. The republican mu&s;t act in the &s;tate, to &s;u&s;tain his preten&s;ions; he mu&s;t join a party, in order to be &s;afe; he mu&s;t form one, in order to be great. The &s;ubject of mo|narchy refers to his birth for the honour he claims; he waits on a court, to &s;hew his importance; and holds out the en&s;igns of dependence and fa|vour, to gain him e&s;teem with the public.</P>
<P>IF national in&s;titutions, calculated for the pre|&s;ervation of liberty, in&s;tead of calling upon the citizen to act for him&s;elf, and to maintain his rights, &s;hould give a &s;ecurity, requiring, on his part, no per&s;onal attention or effort; this &s;eeming perfection of government might weaken the bands of &s;ociety, and, upon maxims of independence, &s;eparate and e&s;trange the different ranks it was meant to reconcile. Neither the parties formed in republics, nor the courtly a&s;&s;emblies which meet in monarchical governments, could take place, where the &s;en&s;e of a mutual dependence &s;hould cea&s;e to &s;ummon their members together. The re&s;orts for commerce might be frequented, and mere amu&s;ement might be pur&s;ued in the croud, while the private dwelling became a retreat for re&s;erve, aver&s;e to the trouble ari&s;ing from regards, and attentions, which it might be part of the po|litical creed to believe of no con&s;equence, and a point of honour to hold in contempt.</P>
<P>THIS humour is not likely to grow either in republics or monarchies: it belongs more proper|ly
<PB N="286" REF="292">
to a mixture of both; where the admini&s;trati|on of ju&s;tice may be better &s;ecured; where the &s;ubject is tempted to look for equality, but where he finds only independence in its place; and where he learns, from a &s;pirit of equality, to hate the very di&s;tinctions to which, on account of their real importance, he pays a remarkable deference.</P>
<P>IN either of the &s;eparate forms of republic or monarchy, or in acting on the principles of either, men are obliged to court their fellow-citi|zens, and to employ parts and addre&s;s to improve their fortunes, or even to be &s;afe. They find in both a &s;chool for di&s;cernment and penetration; but in the one, are taught to overlook the merits of a private character, for the &s;ake of abilities that have weight with the public; and in the other, to overlook great and re&s;pectable talents, for the &s;ake of qualities engaging or plea&s;ant in the &s;cene of entertainment, and private &s;ociety. They are obliged, in both, to adapt them&s;elves with care to the fa&s;hion and manners of their country. They find no place for caprice or &s;ingular humours. The republican mu&s;t be popular, and the courtier polite. The fir&s;t mu&s;t think him&s;elf well placed in every company; the other mu&s;t chu&s;e his re|&s;orts, and de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed only where the &s;ociety it&s;elf is e&s;teemed. With his inferiors, he takes an air of protection; and &s;uffers, in his turn, the &s;ame air to be taken with him&s;elf. It did not, perhaps, require in a Spartan, who fear|ed nothing but a failure in his duty, who loved nothing but his friend and the &s;tate, &s;o con&s;tant a guard on him&s;elf to &s;upport his character, as it frequently does in the &s;ubject of a monarchy, to

adju&s;t his expence and his fortune to the de&s;ires of his vanity, and to appear in a rank as high as his birth, or ambition, can po&s;&s;ibly reach.</P>
<P>THERE is no particular, in the mean time, in which we are more frequently unju&s;t, than in ap|plying to the individual the &s;uppo&s;ed character of his country; or more frequently mi&s;led, than in taking our notion of a people from the example of one, or a few of their members. It belonged to the con&s;titution of Athens, to have produced a Cleon, and a Pericles; but all the Athenians were not, therefore, like Cleon, or Pericles. The|mi&s;tocles and Ari&s;tides lived in the &s;ame age; the one advi&s;ed what was profitable; the other told his country what was ju&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;ame &s;ubject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE law of Nature, with re&s;pect to nations, is the &s;ame that it is with re&s;pect to indi|viduals: it gives to the collective body a right to pre&s;erve them&s;elves; to employ, undi&s;turbed, the means of life; to retain the fruits of labour; to demand ob&s;ervance of &s;tipulations and contracts. In the ca&s;e of violence, it condemns the aggre&s;&s;or, and e&s;tabli&s;hes, on the part of the injured, the right of defence, and a claim to retribution. Its applications, however, admit of di&s;putes, and give ri&s;e to variety in the apprehen&s;ion, as well as the practice of mankind.</P>
<P>NATIONS have agreed univer&s;ally, in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing right from wrong; in exacting the repa|ration of injuries by con&s;ent or by force. They have always repo&s;ed, in a certain degree, on the faith of treaties; but have acted as if force were the ultimate arbiter in all their di&s;putes, and the power to defend them&s;elves, the &s;ure&s;t pledge of their &s;afety. Guided by the&s;e common apprehen|&s;ions, they have differed from one another, not merely in points of form, but in points of the greate&s;t importance, re&s;pecting the u&s;age of war, the effects of captivity, and the rights of conque&s;t and victory.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="295">
WHEN a number of independent communities have been frequently involved in wars, and have had their &s;tated alliances and oppo&s;itions, they adopt cu&s;toms which they make the foundation of rules, or of laws, to be ob&s;erved, or alledged, in all their mutual tran&s;actions. Even in war it&s;elf, they would follow a &s;y&s;tem, and plead for the ob|&s;ervance of forms in their very operations for mu|tual de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE ancient &s;tates of Greece and Italy derived their manners in war from the nature of their re|publican government; tho&s;e of modern Europe, from the influence of monarchy, which, by its prevalence in this part of the world, has a great effect on nations, even where it is not the form e&s;tabli&s;hed. Upon the maxims of this govern|ment, we apprehend a di&s;tinction between the &s;tate and its members, as that between the King and the people, which renders war an operation of policy, not of popular animo&s;ity. While we &s;trike at the public intere&s;t, we would &s;pare the private; and we carry a re&s;pect and con&s;ideration for indi|viduals, which often &s;tops the i&s;&s;ues of blood in the ardour of victory, and procures to the pri&s;oner of war an ho&s;pitable reception in the very city which he came to de&s;troy. The&s;e practices are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that &s;carcely any provocation on the part of an enemy, or any exigence of &s;ervice, can excu&s;e a tre&s;pa&s;s on the &s;uppo&s;ed rules of humani|ty, or &s;ave the leader who commits it from be|coming an object of dete&s;tation and horror.</P>
<P>TO this, the general practice of the Greeks and the Romans was oppo&s;ite. They endeavour|ed to wound the &s;tate by de&s;troying its members,
<PB N="290" REF="296">
by de&s;olating its territory, and by ruining the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of its &s;ubjects. They granted quarter only to in&s;lave, or to bring the pri&s;oner to a more &s;olemn execution; and an enemy, when di&s;arm|ed, was, for the mo&s;t part, either &s;old in the market, or killed, that he might never return to &s;trengthen his party. When this was the i&s;&s;ue of war, it was no wonder, that battles were fought with de&s;peration, and that every fortre&s;s was de|fended to the la&s;t extremity. The game of hu|man life went upon a high &s;take, and was played with a proportional zeal.</P>
<P>THE term <HI>barbarian,</HI> in this &s;tate of manners, could not be employed by the Greeks or the Ro|mans in that &s;en&s;e in which we u&s;e it; to charac|teri&s;e a people regardle&s;s of commercial arts; pro|fu&s;e of their own lives, and of tho&s;e of others; vehement in their attachment to one &s;ociety, and implacable in their antipathy to another. This, in a great and &s;hining part of their hi&s;tory, was their own character, as well as that of &s;ome other na|tions, whom, upon this very account, we di&s;tin|gui&s;h by the appellations of <HI>barbarous</HI> or <HI>rude.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e celebrated nations are indebted, for a great part of their e&s;ti|mation, not to the matter of their hi&s;tory, but to the manner in which it has been delivered, and to the capacity of their hi&s;torians, and other writers. Their &s;tory has been told by men who knew how to draw our attention on the proceedings of the under&s;tanding and of the heart, more than on the detail of fact; and who could exhibit characters to be admired and loved, in the mid&s;t of actions which we &s;hould now univer&s;ally hate or condemn.

<P>OUR manners are &s;o different, and the &s;y&s;tem upon which we regulate our apprehen&s;ions, in many things, &s;o oppo&s;ite, that no le&s;s could make us endure the practice of ancient nations. Were that practice recorded by the mere journali&s;t, who retains only the detail of events, without throw|ing any light on the character of the actors; who, like the Tartar hi&s;torian, tells only what blood was &s;pilt in the field, and how many inhabitants were ma&s;&s;acred in the city; we &s;hould never have di&s;tingui&s;hed the Greeks from their barbarous neighbours, nor have thought, that the character of civility pertained even to the Romans, till very late in their hi&s;tory, and in the decline of their empire.</P>
<P>IT would, no doubt, be plea&s;ant to &s;ee the re|marks of &s;uch a traveller as we &s;ometimes &s;end abroad to in&s;pect the manners of mankind, left, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by hi&s;tory, to collect the character of the Greeks from the &s;tate of their country, or from their practice in war. <Q>This country,</Q> he might &s;ay,
<Q>compared to ours, has an air of barrenne&s;s and de&s;olation. I &s;aw upon the road troops of labourers, who were employed in the fields; but no where the habitations of the ma&s;ter and the landlord. It was un&s;afe, I was told, to re&s;ide in the country; and the people of every di&s;trict

crouded into towns to find a place of defence. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible, that they can be more civilized, till they have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome regu|lar government, and have courts of ju&s;tice to hear their complaints. At pre&s;ent, every town, nay, I may &s;ay, every village, acts for it&s;elf, and the greate&s;t di&s;orders prevail. I was not indeed mole&s;ted; for you mu&s;t know, that they call them&s;elves nations, and do all their mi&s;|chief under the pretence of war.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I do not mean to take any of the liberties of travellers, nor to vie with the celebrated author of the voyage to Lilliput; but cannot help en|deavouring to communicate what I felt on hear|ing them &s;peak of their territory, their armies, their revenue, treaties, and alliances. Only imagine the church-wardens and con&s;tables of Highgate or Hamp&s;tead turned &s;tate&s;men and generals, and you will have a tolerable concep|tion of this &s;ingular country. I pa&s;&s;ed through one &s;tate, where the be&s;t hou&s;e in the capital would not lodge the meane&s;t of your labourers, and where your very beggars would not chu&s;e to dine with the King; and yet they are thought a great nation, and have no le&s;s than two kings. I &s;aw one of them; but &s;uch a potentate! he had &s;carcely cloaths to his back; and for his Maje&s;ty's table, he was obliged to go to the eating-hou&s;e with his &s;ubjects. They have not a &s;ingle farthing of money; and I was obliged to get food at the public expence, there being none to be had in the market. You will ima|gine, that there mu&s;t have been a &s;ervice of plate, and great attendance, to wait upon the illu&s;trious &s;tranger; but my fare was a me&s;s of &s;orry pottage, brought me by a naked &s;lave,
<PB N="293" REF="299">
who left me to deal with it as I thought proper: and even this I was in continual danger of having &s;tolen from me by the children, who are as vi|gilant to &s;eize opportunities, and as dextrous in &s;natching their food, as any &s;tarved greyhound you ever &s;aw. The mi&s;ery of the whole people, in &s;hort, as well as my own, while I &s;taid there, was beyond de&s;cription. You would think that their whole attention were to torment them&s;elves as much as they can: they are even di&s;plea&s;ed with one of their kings for being well liked. He had made a pre&s;ent, while I was there, of a cow to one favourite, and of a wai&s;tcoat to another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, in the life of Age&s;ilaus.</NOTE>; and it was publicly &s;aid, that this method of gaining friends was robbing the pub|lic. My landlord told me very gravely, that a man &s;hould come under no obligation that might weaken the love which he owes to his country; nor form any per&s;onal attachment beyond the mere habit of living with his friend, and of do|ing him a kindne&s;s when he can.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I a&s;ked him once, Why they did not, for their own &s;akes, enable their kings to a&s;&s;ume a little more &s;tate? Becau&s;e &s;ays he, we intend them the happine&s;s of living with men.

<Q>That he could not under&s;tand how &s;cholars, fine gentlemen, and even women, &s;hould combine to admire a peo|ple, who &s;o little re&s;emble them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>TO form a judgement of the character from which they acted in the field, and in their compe|titions with neighbouring nations, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve them at home. They were bold and fearle&s;s in their civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions; ready to proceed to extre|mities, and to carry their debates to the deci&s;ion of force. Individuals &s;tood di&s;tingui&s;hed by their per|&s;onal &s;pirit and vigour, not by the valuation of their e&s;tates, or the rank of their birth. They had a per|&s;onal elevation founded on the &s;en&s;e of equality, not of precedence. The general of one campaign was, during the next, a private &s;oldier, and &s;er|ved
<PB N="296" REF="302">
in the ranks. They were &s;olicitous to acquire bodily &s;trength; becau&s;e, in the u&s;e of their wea|pons, battles were a trial of the &s;oldier's &s;trength, as well as of the leader's conduct. The remains of their &s;tatuary, &s;hews a manly grace, an air of &s;implicity and ea&s;e, which being frequent in na|ture, were familiar to the arti&s;t. The mind, per|haps, borrowed a confidence and force, from the vigour and addre&s;s of the body; their eloquence and &s;tyle bore a re&s;emblance to the carriage of the per&s;on. The under&s;tanding was chiefly cultivated in the practice of affairs. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;onages were obliged to mix with the croud, and derived their degree of a&s;cendency, only from their conduct, their eloquence, and per&s;onal vi|gour. They had no forms of expre&s;&s;ion, to mark a ceremonious and guarded re&s;pect. Invective pro|ceeded to railing, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms were of|ten employed by the mo&s;t admired and accom|pli&s;hed orators. Quarrelling had no rules but the immediate dictates of pa&s;&s;ion, which ended in words of reproach, in violence and blows. They fortunately went always unarmed; and to wear a &s;word in times of peace, was among them the mark of a barbarian. When they took arms in the divi&s;ions of faction, the prevailing party &s;up|ported it&s;elf by expelling their opponents, by pro|&s;criptions, and blood&s;hed. The u&s;urper endeavour|ed to maintain his &s;tation by the mo&s;t violent and prompt executions. He was oppo&s;ed, in his turn by con&s;piracies and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, in which the mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens were ready to u&s;e the dagger.</P>
<P>SUCH was the character of their &s;pirit, in its occa&s;ional ferments at home; and it bur&s;t com|monly
<PB N="297" REF="303">
with a &s;uitable violence and force, again&s;t their foreign rivals and enemies. The amiable plea of humanity was little regarded by them in the operations of war. Cities were razed, or in|&s;laved; the captive &s;old, mutilated, or condemn|ed to die.</P>
<P>WHEN viewed on this &s;ide, the ancient na|tions have but a &s;orry plea for e&s;teem with the in|habitants of modern Europe, who profe&s;s to carry the civilities of peace into the practice of war; and who value the prai&s;e of indi&s;criminate lenity at a higher rate than even that of military prowe&s;s, or the love of their country. And yet they have in other re&s;pects, merited and obtained our prai&s;e. Their ardent attachment to their coun|try; their contempt of &s;uffering, and of death, in its cau&s;e; their manly apprehen&s;ions of per&s;onal independence, which rendered every individual, even under tottering e&s;tabli&s;hments, and imper|fect laws, the guardian of freedom to his fellow|citizens; their activity of mind; in &s;hort, their penetration, the ability of their conduct, and force of their &s;pirit, have gained them the fir&s;t rank among nations.</P>
<P>IF their animo&s;ities were great, their affections were proportionate: they, perhaps, loved, where we only pity; and were &s;tern and inexorable, where we are not merciful, but only irre&s;olute. After all, the merit of a man is determined by his candour and genero&s;ity to his a&s;&s;ociates, by his zeal for national objects, and by his vigour in maintaining political rights; not by moderation alone, which proceeds frequently from indiffer|ence to national and public intere&s;ts, and which
<PB N="298" REF="304">
&s;erves to relax the nerves on which the force of a private as well as a public character depends.</P>
<P>WHEN under the Macedonian and the Roman monarchies, a nation came to be con&s;idered as the e&s;tate of a prince, and the inhabitants of a pro|vince to be regarded as a lucrative property, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of territory, not the de&s;truction of its people, became the object of conque&s;t. The pacific citizen had little concern in the quarrels of &s;overeigns; the violence of the &s;oldier was re|&s;trained by di&s;cipline. He fought, becau&s;e he was taught to carry arms, and to obey: he &s;ometimes &s;hed unnece&s;&s;ary blood in the ardour of victory; but, except in the ca&s;e of civil wars, had no pa&s;|&s;ions to excite his animo&s;ity beyond the field and the day of battle. Leaders judged of the objects of an enterpri&s;e, and they arre&s;ted the &s;word when the&s;e were obtained.</P>
<P>IN the modern nations of Europe, where ex|tent of territory admits of a di&s;tinction between the &s;tate and its &s;ubjects, we are accu&s;tomed to think of the individual with compa&s;&s;ion, &s;eldom of the public with zeal. We have improved on the laws of war, and on the lenitives which have been devi&s;ed to &s;often its rigours; we have min|gled politene&s;s with the u&s;e of the &s;word; we have learned to make war under the &s;tipulations of trea|ties and cartels, and tru&s;t to the faith of an enemy who&s;e ruin we meditate. Glory is more &s;ucce&s;s|fully obtained by &s;aving and protecting, than by de&s;troying the vanqui&s;hed: and the mo&s;t amiable of all objects is, in appearance, attained; the employing of force, only for the obtaining of ju&s;|tice, and for the pre&s;ervation of national rights.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="305">
THIS is, perhaps, the principal characteri&s;tic, on which, among modern nations, we be&s;tow the epithets of <HI>civilized</HI> or of <HI>poli&s;hed.</HI> But we have &s;een, that it did not accompany the progre&s;s of arts among the Greeks, nor keep pace with the advancement of policy, literature, and philo&s;ophy. It did not await the returns of learning and po|litene&s;s among the moderns; it was found in early periods of our hi&s;tory, and di&s;tingui&s;hed, perhaps, more than at pre&s;ent, the manners of ages other|wi&s;e rude and undi&s;ciplined. A King of France, pri&s;oner in the hands of his enemies, was treated, about four hundred years ago, with as much di|&s;tinction and courte&s;y, as a crowned head, in the like circum&s;tances, could po&s;&s;ibly expect in this age of politene&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Hi&s;tory of England.</NOTE>.

<P>IF the moral of popular traditions, and the ta&s;te of fabulous legends, which are the produc|tion or entertainment of particular ages, are like|wi&s;e &s;ure indications of their notions and charac|ters, we may pre&s;ume, that the foundation of what is now held to be the law of war, and of nations, was laid in the manners of Europe, together with the &s;entiments which are expre&s;&s;ed in the tales of chivalry, and of gallantry. Our &s;y&s;tem of war differs not more from that of the Greeks, than the favourite characters of our early romance dif|fered
<PB N="300" REF="306">
from tho&s;e of the Iliad, and of every ancient poem. The hero of the Greek fable, endued with &s;uperior force, courage, and addre&s;s, takes every advantage of an enemy, to kill with &s;afety to him|&s;elf; and actuated by a de&s;ire of &s;poil, or by a principle of revenge, is never &s;tayed in his pro|gre&s;s by interruptions of remor&s;e or compa&s;&s;ion. Homer, who, of all poets, knew be&s;t how to exhibit the emotions of a vehement affection, &s;el|dom attempts to excite commi&s;eration. Hector falls unpitied, and his body is in&s;ulted by every Greek.</P>
<P>OUR modern fable, or romance, on the con|trary, generally couples an object of pity, weak, oppre&s;&s;ed, and defencele&s;s, with an object of ad|miration, brave, generous, and victorious; or &s;ends the hero abroad in &s;earch of mere danger, and of occa&s;ions to prove his valour. Charged with the maxims of a refined courte&s;y, to be ob|&s;erved even towards an enemy; and of a &s;crupu|lous honour, which will not &s;uffer him to take any advantages by artifice or &s;urpri&s;e; indifferent to &s;poil, he contends only for renown, and employs his valour to re&s;cue the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and to protect the innocent. If victorious, he is made to ri&s;e above nature as much in his genero&s;ity and gentle|ne&s;s, as in his military prowe&s;s and valour.</P>
<P>IT may be difficult, upon &s;tating this contra&s;t between the &s;y&s;tem of ancient and modern fable, to a&s;&s;ign, among nations equally rude, equally ad|dicted to war, and equally fond of military glory, the origin of apprehen&s;ions on the point of honour, &s;o different, and &s;o oppo&s;ite. The hero of Greek poetry proceeds on the maxims of animo&s;ity and
<PB N="301" REF="307">
ho&s;tile pa&s;&s;ion. His maxims in war are like tho&s;e which prevail in the woods of America. They require him to be brave, but they allow him to practi&s;e again&s;t his enemy every &s;ort of deception. The hero of modern romance profe&s;&s;es a contempt of &s;tratagem, as well as of danger, and unites in the &s;ame per&s;on, characters and di&s;po&s;itions &s;eem|ingly oppo&s;ite; ferocity with gentlene&s;s, and the love of blood with &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and pity.</P>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of chivalry, when completely formed, proceeded on a marvellous re&s;pect and ve|neration to the fair &s;ex, on forms of combat e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and on a &s;uppo&s;ed junction of the heroic and &s;anctified character. The formalities of the duel, and a kind of judicial challenge, were known among the ancient Celtic nations of Europe. The Germans, even in their native fore&s;ts, paid a kind of devotion to the female &s;ex. The Chri&s;tian re|ligion injoined meekne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to barba|rous ages. The&s;e different principles combined together, may have &s;erved as the foundation of a &s;y&s;tem, in which courage was directed by religion and love, and the warlike and gentle were united together. When the characters of the hero and the &s;aint were mixed, the mild &s;pirit of Chri&s;tia|nity, though often turned into venom by the bi|gotry of oppo&s;ite parties, though it could not al|ways &s;ubdue the ferocity of the warrior, nor &s;up|pre&s;s the admiration of courage and force, may have confirmed the apprehen&s;ions of men in what was to be held meritorious and &s;plendid in the conduct of their quarrels.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="308">
IN the early and traditionary hi&s;tory of the Greeks and the Romans, rapes were a&s;&s;igned as the mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ions of war; and the &s;exes were, no doubt, at all times, equally important to each other. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of love is mo&s;t powerful in the neighbourhood of A&s;ia and Africa; and beauty, as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was probably more valued by the countrymen of Homer, than it was by tho&s;e of Amadis de Gaul, or by the authors of modern gallantry. <Q>What wonder,</Q> &s;ays the old Priam, when Helen appeared,
<Q>that nations &s;hould contend for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o much beauty?</Q>
This beauty, indeed, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by different lovers; a &s;ubject on which the modern hero had many refinements, and &s;eemed to &s;oar in the clouds. He adored at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, and employed his valour to captivate the admira|tion, not to gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mi&s;tre&s;s. A cold and unconquerable cha&s;tity was &s;et up, as an idol to be wor&s;hipped, in the toils, the &s;ufferings, and the combats of the hero and the lover.</P>
<P>THE feudal e&s;tabli&s;hments, by the high rank to which they elevated certain families, no doubt greatly favoured this romantic &s;y&s;tem. Not only the lu&s;tre of a noble de&s;cent, but the &s;tately ca&s;tle be&s;et with battlements and towers, &s;erved to in|flame the imagination, and create a veneration for the daughter and the &s;i&s;ter of gallant chiefs, who&s;e point of honour it was to be inacce&s;&s;ible and cha&s;te, and who could perceive no merit but that of the high-minded and the brave, nor be ap|proached in any other accents than tho&s;e of gen|tlene&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="309">
WHAT was originally &s;ingular in the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions, was, by the writer of romance, turned to extravagance; and under the title of chivalry was offered as a model of conduct, even in com|mon affairs: the fortunes of nations were directed by gallantry; and human life, on its greate&s;t oc|ca&s;ions, became a &s;cene of affectation and folly. Warriors went forth to realize the legends they had &s;tudied; princes and leaders of armies dedi|cated their mo&s;t &s;erious exploits to a real or to a fancied mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT whatever was the origin of notions, often &s;o lofty and &s;o ridiculous, we cannot doubt of their la&s;ting effects on our manners. The point of ho|nour, the prevalence of gallantry in our conver&s;a|tions, and on our theatres, many of the opinions which the vulgar apply even to the conduct of war; their notion, that the leader of an army, being offered battle upon equal terms, is di&s;ho|noured by declining it, are undoubtedly remains of this antiquated &s;y&s;tem: and chivalry, uniting with the genius of our policy, has probably &s;ug|ge&s;ted tho&s;e particularities in the law of nations, by which modern &s;tates are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ancient. And if our rule in mea&s;uring degrees of politene&s;s and civilization is to be taken from hence, or from the advancement of commercial arts, we &s;hall be found to have greatly excelled any of the celebrated nations of antiquity.</P>

We even &s;ometimes contend, who&s;e capital is the mo&s;t overgrown; who&s;e king has the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power: and at who&s;e court the bread of the &s;ub|ject is con&s;umed in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s riot. The&s;e indeed are the notions of vulgar minds; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine, how far the notions of vulgar minds may lead mankind.</P>
<P>THERE have certainly been very few exam|ples of &s;tates, who have, by arts or policy, im|proved the original di&s;po&s;itions of human nature, or endeavoured, by wi&s;e and effectual precautions, to prevent its corruption. Affection, and force of mind, which are the band and the &s;trength of communities, were the in&s;piration of God, and original attributes in the nature of man. The wi&s;e&s;t policy of nations, except in a very few in|&s;tances, has tended, we may &s;u&s;pect, rather to maintain the peace of &s;ociety, and to repre&s;s the external effects of bad pa&s;&s;ions, than to &s;trengthen the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart it&s;elf to ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s. It has tended, by introducing a variety of arts, to exerci&s;e the ingenuity of men, and by engaging them in a variety of pur&s;uits, inquiries,
<PB N="308" REF="313">
and &s;tudies, to inform, but frequently to corrupt the mind. It has tended to furni&s;h matter of di|&s;tinction and vanity; and by incumbering the in|dividual with new &s;ubjects of per&s;onal care, to &s;ub&s;titute the anxiety he entertains for him&s;elf, in|&s;tead of the confidence and the affection he &s;hould entertain for his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>WHETHER this &s;u&s;picion be ju&s;t or no, we are come to point at circum&s;tances tending to ve|rify, or to di&s;prove it: and if to under&s;tand the real felicity of nations be of importance, it is cer|tainly &s;o likewi&s;e, to know what are tho&s;e weak|ne&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e vices, by which men not only mar this felicity, but in one age forfeit all the ex|ternal advantages they had gained in a former.</P>
<P>THE wealth, the aggrandizement and power of nations, are commonly the effects of virtue; the lo&s;s of the&s;e advantages, is often a con&s;equence of vice.</P>
<P>WERE we to &s;uppo&s;e men to have &s;ucceeded in the di&s;covery and application of every art by which &s;tates are pre&s;erved, and governed; to have attained, by efforts of wi&s;dom and magnanimity, the admired e&s;tabli&s;hments and advantages of a civilized and flouri&s;hing people; the &s;ub&s;e|quent part of their hi&s;tory, containing, according to vulgar apprehen&s;ion, a full di&s;play of tho&s;e fruits in maturity, of which they had till then carried only the blo&s;&s;om, and the fir&s;t formation, &s;hould, &s;till more than the former, merit our at|tention, and excite our admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="314">
THE event, however, has not corre&s;ponded to this expectation. The virtues of men have &s;hone mo&s;t during their &s;truggles, not after the attain|ment of their ends. Tho&s;e ends them&s;elves, though attained by virtue, are frequently the cau&s;es of corruption and vice. Mankind, in a&s;|piring to national felicity, have &s;ub&s;tituted arts which increa&s;e their riches, in&s;tead of tho&s;e which improve their nature. They have entertained ad|miration of them&s;elves, under the titles of <HI>civili|zed</HI> and of <HI>poli&s;hed,</HI> where they &s;hould have been affected with &s;hame; and even where they have for a while acted on maxims tending to rai&s;e, to invigorate, and to pre&s;erve the national character, they have, &s;ooner or later, been diverted from their object, and fallen a prey to misfortune, or to the neglects which pro&s;perity it&s;elf had encou|raged.</P>
<P>WAR, which furni&s;hes mankind with a princi|pal occupation of their re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, &s;erves, by the variety of its events, to diver&s;ify their fortunes. While it opens to one tribe or &s;ociety, the way to eminence, and leads to dominion, it brings another to &s;ubjection, and clo&s;es the &s;cene of their national efforts. The celebrated rival&s;hip of Car|thage and Rome was, in both parties, the natu|ral exerci&s;e of an ambitious &s;pirit, impatient of oppo&s;ition, or even of equality. The conduct and the fortune of leaders, held the balance for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence; but to which ever &s;ide it had in|clined, a great nation was to fall; a &s;eat of em|pire, and of policy, was to be removed from its place; and it was then to be determined, whether
<PB N="310" REF="315">
the Syriac or the Latin &s;hould contain the erudi|tion that was, in future ages, to occupy the &s;tu|dies of the learned.</P>
<P>STATES have been thus conquered from abroad, before they gave any &s;igns of internal decay, even in the mid&s;t of pro&s;perity, and in the period of their greate&s;t ardour for national objects. Athens, in the height of her ambition, and of her glory, received a fatal wound, in &s;triving to extend her maritime power beyond the Grecian &s;eas. And nations of every de&s;cription, formidable by their rude ferocity, re&s;pected for their di&s;cipline and military experience, when advancing, as well as when declining, in their &s;trength, fell a prey, by turns, to the ambition and arrogant &s;pirit of the Romans. Such examples may excite and alarm the jealou&s;y and caution of &s;tates; the pre&s;ence of &s;imilar dangers may exerci&s;e the talents of politi|cians and &s;tate&s;men; but mere rever&s;es of for|tune are the common materials of hi&s;tory, and mu&s;t long &s;ince have cea&s;ed to create our &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>DID we find, that nations advancing from &s;mall beginnings, and arrived at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of arts which lead to dominion, became &s;ecure of their advantages, in proportion as they were qualified to gain them; that they proceeded in a cour&s;e of un|interrupted felicity, till they were broke by exter|nal calamities; and that they retained their force, till a more fortunate or vigorous power aro&s;e to de|pre&s;s them; the &s;ubject in &s;peculation could not be attended with many difficulties, nor give ri&s;e to many reflections. But when we ob&s;erve among
<PB N="311" REF="316">
nations a kind of &s;pontaneous return to ob&s;curity and weakne&s;s; when, in &s;pite of perpetual admo|nitions of the danger they run, they &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be &s;ubdued, in one period, by powers which could not have entered into competition with them in a former, and by forces which they had often baffled and de&s;pi&s;ed; the &s;ubject be|comes more curious, and its explanation more difficult.</P>
<P>THE fact it&s;elf is known in a variety of diffe|rent examples. The empire of A&s;ia was, more than once, transferred from the greater to the in|ferior power. The &s;tates of Greece, once &s;o war|like, felt a relaxation of their vigour, and yielded the a&s;cendant they had di&s;puted with the monarchs of the ea&s;t, to the forces of an ob&s;cure principa|lity, become formidable in a few years, and rai&s;ed to eminence under the conduct of a &s;ingle man. The Roman empire, which &s;tood alone for ages; which had brought every rival under &s;ubjection, and &s;aw no power from whom a competition could be feared, &s;unk at la&s;t before an artle&s;s and contemp|tible enemy. Abandoned to inroad, to pillage, and at la&s;t to conque&s;t, on her frontier, &s;he decayed in all her extremities, and &s;hrunk on every &s;ide. Her territory was di&s;membered, and whole provinces gave way, like branches fallen down with age, not violently torn by &s;uperior force. The &s;pirit with which Marius had baffled and repelled the attacks of barbarians in a former age, the civil and military force with which the con&s;ul and his legions had extended this empire, were now no more. The Roman greatne&s;s, doomed to &s;ink as it ro&s;e, by &s;low degrees, was impaired in every encounter.
<PB N="312" REF="317">
It was reduced to its original dimen&s;ions, within the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle city; and depending for its pre&s;ervation on the fortune of a &s;iege, it was extingui&s;hed at a blow; and the brand, which had filled the world with its flames, &s;unk like a taper in the &s;ocket.</P>
<P>SUCH appearances have given ri&s;e to a general apprehen&s;ion, that the progre&s;s of &s;ocieties to what we call the heights of national greatne&s;s, is not more natural, than their return to weakne&s;s and ob&s;curity is nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. The images of youth, and of old age, are applied to nations; and communities, like &s;ingle men, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a period of life, and a length of thread, which is &s;pun by the fates in one part uniform and &s;trong, in another weakened and &s;hattered by u&s;e; to be cut, when the de&s;tined aera is come, and to make way for a renewal of the emblem in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who ari&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Carthage, being &s;o much older than Rome, had felt her decay, &s;ays Polybius, &s;o much the &s;ooner: and the &s;urvivor too, he fore&s;aw, carried in her bo&s;om the &s;eeds of mortality.</P>
<P>THE image indeed is appo&s;ite, and the hi&s;tory of mankind renders the application familiar. But it mu&s;t be obvious, that the ca&s;e of nations, and that of individuals, are very different. The hu|man frame has a general cour&s;e; it has, in every individual, a frail contexture, and a limited dura|tion; it is worn by exerci&s;e, and exhau&s;ted by a repetition of its functions: But in a &s;ociety, who&s;e con&s;tituent members are renewed in every genera|tion, where the race &s;eems to enjoy perpetual
<PB N="313" REF="318">
youth, and accumulating advantages, we cannot, by any parity of rea&s;on, expect to find imbecilities connected with mere age and length of days.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject is not new, and reflections will croud upon every reader. The notions, in the mean time, which we entertain, even in &s;pecula|tion, upon a &s;ubject &s;o important, cannot be en|tirely fruitle&s;s to mankind; and however little the labours of the &s;peculative may influence the con|duct of men, one of the mo&s;t pardonable errors a writer can commit, is to believe that he is about to do a great deal of good. But leaving the care of effects to others, we proceed to con&s;ider the grounds of incon&s;tancy among mankind, the &s;ources of internal decay, and the ruinous corrup|tions to which nations are liable, in the &s;uppo&s;ed condition of accompli&s;hed civility.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Temporary Efforts and Relaxations of the National Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what we have already ob&s;erved on the general characteri&s;tics of human nature, it has appeared, that man is not made for repo&s;e. In him, every amiable and re&s;pectable quality is an active power, and every &s;ubject of commen|dation an effort. If his errors and his crimes are the movements of an active being, his virtues and his happine&s;s con&s;i&s;t likewi&s;e in the employment of his mind; and all the lu&s;tre which he ca&s;ts a|round him, to captivate or engage the attention of his fellow-creatures, like the flame of a meteor, &s;hines only while his motion continues: the mo|ments of re&s;t and of ob&s;curity are the &s;ame. We know, that the ta&s;ks a&s;&s;igned him frequently may exceed, as well as come &s;hort of his powers; that he may be agitated too much, as well as too little; but cannot a&s;certain a preci&s;e medium between the &s;ituations in which he would be hara&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e in which he would fall into languor. We know, that he may be employed on a great variety of &s;ubjects, which occupy different pa&s;&s;ions; and that, in con&s;equence of habit, he becomes reconciled to very different &s;cenes. All we can determine in ge|neral
<PB N="315" REF="320">
is, that whatever be the &s;ubjects with which he is engaged, the frame of his nature requires him to be occupied, and his happine&s;s requires him to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>WE are now to inquire, why nations cea&s;e to be eminent; and why &s;ocieties which have drawn the attention of mankind by great examples of magnanimity, conduct, and national &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hould &s;ink from the height of their honours, and yield, in one age, the palm which they had won in a former. Many rea&s;ons will probably occur. One may be taken from the ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy of mankind, who become tired of their pur&s;uits and exertions, even while the occa&s;ions that gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e pur&s;uits, in &s;ome mea&s;ure continue: Another, from the change of &s;ituations, and the removal of objects which &s;erved to excite their &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE public &s;afety, and the relative intere&s;ts of &s;tates; political e&s;tabli&s;hments, the preten&s;ions of party, commerce, and arts, are &s;ubjects which en|gage the attention of nations. The advantages gained in &s;ome of the&s;e particulars, determine the degree of national pro&s;perity. The ardour and vigour with which they are at any one time pur|&s;ued, is the mea&s;ure of a national &s;pirit. When tho&s;e objects cea&s;e to animate, nations may be &s;aid to langui&s;h; when they are during any con|&s;iderable time neglected, &s;tates mu&s;t decline, and their people degenerate.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t forward, enterpri&s;ing, inventive, and indu&s;trious nations, this &s;pirit is fluctuating;
<PB N="316" REF="321">
and they who continue longe&s;t to gain advantages, or to pre&s;erve them, have periods of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, as well as of ardour. The de&s;ire of public &s;afety, is, at all times, a powerful motive of conduct; but it operates mo&s;t, when combined with occa&s;ional pa&s;&s;ions, when provocations inflame, when &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es encourage, or mortifications exa&s;perate.</P>
<P>A WHOLE people, like the individuals of whom they are compo&s;ed, act under the influence of tem|porary humours, &s;anguine hopes, or vehement ani|mo&s;ities. They are di&s;po&s;ed, at one time, to enter on national &s;truggles with vehemence; at another, to drop them from mere la&s;&s;itude and di&s;gu&s;t. In their civil debates and contentions at home, they are occa&s;ionally ardent or remi&s;s. Epidemical pa&s;|&s;ions ari&s;e or &s;ub&s;ide, on trivial, as well as im|portant, grounds. Parties are ready, at one time, to take their names, and the pretence of their op|po&s;itions, from mere caprice or accident; at an|other time, they &s;uffer the mo&s;t &s;erious occa&s;ions to pa&s;s in &s;ilence. If a vein of literary genius be ca&s;ually opened, or a new &s;ubject of di&s;qui&s;ition be &s;tarted, real or pretended di&s;coveries &s;uddenly mul|tiply, and every conver&s;ation is inqui&s;itive and ani|mated. If a new &s;ource of wealth be found, or a pro&s;pect of conque&s;t be offered, the imaginations of men are inflamed, and whole quarters of the globe are &s;uddenly engaged in ruinous or in &s;uc|ce&s;sful adventures.</P>
<P>COULD we recall the &s;pirit that was exerted, or enter into the views that were entertained, by our ance&s;tors, when they bur&s;t, like a deluge, from their ancient &s;eats, and poured into the Roman
<PB N="317" REF="322">
Empire, we &s;hould probably, after their fir&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t, find a ferment in the minds of men, for which no attempt was too arduous, no difficulties in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent ages of enterpri&s;e in Europe, were tho&s;e in which the alarm of enthu&s;ia&s;m was rung, and the followers of the cro&s;s invaded the Ea&s;t, to plunder a country, and to recover a &s;e|pulchre; tho&s;e in which the people in different &s;tates contended for freedom, and a&s;&s;aulted the fabric of civil or religious u&s;urpation; that in which having found means to cro&s;s the Atlantic, and to double the Cape of Good Hope, the in|habitants of one half the world were let loo&s;e on the other, and parties from every quarter, wading in blood, and at the expence of every crime, and of every danger, traver&s;ed the earth in &s;earch of gold.</P>
<P>EVEN the weak and the remi&s;s are rou&s;ed to enterpri&s;e, by the contagion of &s;uch remarkable ages; and &s;tates which have not in their form the principles of a continued exertion, either favour|able or adver&s;e to the welfare of mankind, may have paroxy&s;ms of ardour, and a temporary ap|pearance of national vigour. In the ca&s;e of &s;uch nations, indeed, the returns of moderation are but a relap&s;e to ob&s;curity, and the pre&s;umption of one age is turned to dejection in that which &s;uc|ceeds.</P>
<P>BUT in the ca&s;e of &s;tates that are fortunate in their dome&s;tic policy, even madne&s;s it&s;elf may, in the re&s;ult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of violent convul&s;ions, &s;ub&s;ide into

wi&s;dom; and a people return to their ordinary mood, cured of their follies, and wi&s;er by expe|rience: or, with talents improved, in conducting the very &s;cenes which frenzy had opened, they may then appear be&s;t qualified to pur&s;ue with &s;ucce&s;s the object of nations. Like the ancient republics, immediately after &s;ome alarming &s;edi|tion, or like the kingdom of Great Britain, at the clo&s;e of its civil wars, they retain the &s;pirit of activity, which was recently awakened, and are equally vigorous in every pur&s;uit, whether of poli|cy, learning, or arts. From having appeared on the brink of ruin, they pa&s;s to the greate&s;t pro&s;|perity.</P>
<P>MEN engage in pur&s;uits with degrees of ar|dour not proportioned to the importance of their object. When they are &s;tated in oppo&s;ition, or joined in confederacy, they only wi&s;h for pretences to act. They forget, in the heat of their animo|&s;ities, the &s;ubject of their controver&s;y; or they &s;eek, in their formal rea&s;onings concerning it, only a di&s;gui&s;e for their pa&s;&s;ions. When the heart is inflamed, no con&s;ideration can repre&s;s its ardour; when its fervour &s;ub&s;ides, no rea&s;oning can ex|cite, and no eloquence awaken, its former emo|tions.</P>
<P>THE continuance of emulation among &s;tates, mu&s;t depend on the degree of equality by which their forces are balanced; or on the incentives by which either party, or all, are urged to continue their &s;truggles. Long intermi&s;&s;ions of war, &s;uf|fer, equally in every period of civil &s;ociety, the military &s;pirit to langui&s;h. The reduction of

Athens by Ly&s;ander, &s;truck a fatal blow at the in|&s;titutions of Lycurgus; and the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Italy, happily, perhaps, for mankind, had al|mo&s;t put an end to the military progre&s;s of the Romans. After &s;ome years of repo&s;e, Hannibal found Italy unprepared for his on&s;et, and the Ro|mans in a di&s;po&s;ition likely to drop, on the banks of the Po, that martial ambition, which, being rou&s;ed by the &s;en&s;e of a new danger, afterwards carried them to the Euphrates and the Rhine.</P>
<P>STATES even di&s;tingui&s;hed for military prowe&s;s, &s;ometimes lay down their arms from la&s;|&s;itude, and are weary of fruitle&s;s contentions: but if they maintain the &s;tation of independent com|munities, they will have frequent occa&s;ions to recall, and exert their vigour. Even under po|pular governments, men &s;ometimes drop the con|&s;ideration of their political rights, and appear at times remi&s;s or &s;upine; but if they have re&s;erv|ed the power to defend them&s;elves, the inter|mi&s;&s;ion of its exerci&s;e cannot be of long dura|tion. Political rights, when neglected, are al|ways invaded; and alarms from this quarter mu&s;t frequently come to renew the attention of parties. The love of learning, and of arts, may change its pur&s;uits, or droop for a &s;ea&s;on; but while men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, and while the exerci&s;es of ingenuity are not &s;uper&s;eded, the public may proceed, at different times, with unequal fervour; but its progre&s;s is &s;el|dom altogether di&s;continued, or the advantages gained in one age are &s;eldom entirely lo&s;t to the following.</P>

<HEAD>Of Relaxations in the National Spirit incident to Poli&s;hed Nations.</HEAD>
<P>IMPROVING nations, in the cour&s;e of their advancement, have to &s;truggle with foreign enemies, to whom they bear an extreme animo|&s;ity, and with whom, in many conflicts, they con|tend for their exi&s;tence as a people. In certain periods too, they feel in their dome&s;tic policy in|conveniencies and grievances, which beget an eager impatience; and they apprehend reformations and new e&s;tabli&s;hments, from which they have &s;anguine hopes of national happine&s;s. In early ages, every art is imperfect, and &s;u&s;ceptible of many improvements. The fir&s;t principles of eve|ry &s;cience are yet &s;ecrets to be di&s;covered, and to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively publi&s;hed with applau&s;e and triumph.</P>
<P>WE may fancy to our&s;elves, that in ages of progre&s;s, the human race, like &s;couts gone abroad on the di&s;covery of fertile lands, having the world open before them, are pre&s;ented at every &s;tep with the appearance of novelty. They enter on every new ground with expectation and joy: They engage in every enterpri&s;e with the ardour of men, who believe they are going to arrive at national felicity, and permanent glory; and forget pa&s;t di&s;appointments amid&s;t the hopes of future &s;uc|ce&s;s.
<PB N="322" REF="327">
From mere ignorance, rude minds are in|toxicated with every pa&s;&s;ion; and partial to their own condition, and to their own pur&s;uits, they think that every &s;cene is inferior to that in which they are placed. Rou&s;ed alike by &s;ucce&s;s, and by misfortune, they are &s;anguine, ardent, and pre|cipitant; and leave to the more knowing ages which &s;ucceed them, monuments of imperfect &s;kill, and of rude execution in every art; but they leave likewi&s;e the marks of a vigorous and ardent &s;pirit, which their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are not al|ways qualified to &s;u&s;tain, or to imitate.</P>
<P>THIS may be admitted, perhaps, as a fair de&s;cription of pro&s;perous &s;ocieties, at lea&s;t during certain periods of their progre&s;s. The &s;pirit with which they advance may be unequal, in different ages, and may have its paroxy&s;ms, and inter|mi&s;&s;ions, ari&s;ing from the incon&s;tancy of human pa&s;&s;ions, and from the ca&s;ual appearance or re|moval of occa&s;ions that excite them. But does this &s;pirit, which for a time continues to carry on the project of civil and commercial arts, find a natural pau&s;e in the termination of its own pur|&s;uits? May the bu&s;ine&s;s of civil &s;ociety be accom|pli&s;hed, and may the occa&s;ion of farther exertion be removed? Do continued di&s;appointments re|duce &s;anguine hopes, and familiarity with ob|jects blunt the edge of novelty? Does experience it&s;elf cool the ardour of the mind? May the &s;o|ciety be again compared to the individual? And may it be &s;u&s;pected, although the vigour of a na|tion, like that of a natural body, does not wa&s;te by a phy&s;ical decay, that yet it may &s;icken for want of exerci&s;e, and die in the clo&s;e of its own exertions? May &s;ocieties, in the completion of

all their de&s;igns, like men in years, who di&s;regard the amu&s;ements, and are in&s;en&s;ible to the pa&s;&s;ions, of youth, become cold and indifferent to objects that u&s;ed to animate in a ruder age? And may a poli&s;hed community be compared to a man, who having executed his plan, built his hou&s;e, and made his &s;ettlement; who having, in &s;hort, ex|hau&s;ted the charms of every &s;ubject, and wa&s;ted all his ardour, &s;inks into languor and li&s;tle&s;s in|difference? If &s;o, we have found at lea&s;t another &s;imile to our purpo&s;e. But it is probable, that here too, the re&s;emblance is imperfect; and the inference that would follow, like that of mo&s;t ar|guments drawn from analogy, tends rather to a|mu&s;e the fancy, than to give any real information on the &s;ubject to which it refers.</P>

<P>IT is true, in general, that in all our pur&s;uits, there is a termination of trouble, and a point of repo&s;e to which we a&s;pire. We would remove this inconvenience, or gain that advantage, that our labours may cea&s;e. When I have conquered Italy and Sicily, &s;ay Pyrrhus, I &s;hall then enjoy my repo&s;e. This termination is propo&s;ed in our national as well as in our per&s;onal exertions; and in &s;pite of frequent experience to the contrary, is con&s;idered at a di&s;tance as the height of felicity. But nature has wi&s;ely, in mo&s;t particulars, baffled our project; and placed no where within our reach this vi&s;ionary ble&s;&s;ing of ab&s;olute ea&s;e. The attainment of one end is but the beginning of a new pur&s;uit; and the di&s;covery of one art is but a prolongation of the thread by which we are con|ducted to further inquiries, and only hope to e&s;|cape from the labyrinth.</P>
<P>AMONG the occupations that may be enu|merated, as tending to exerci&s;e the invention, and to cultivate the talents of men, are the pur&s;uits of accommodation and wealth, including all the dif|ferent contrivances which &s;erve to increa&s;e manu|factures, and to perfect the mechanical arts.

<P>IN the re&s;ult of commercial arts, inequalities of fortune are greatly increa&s;ed, and the majori|ty of every people are obliged by nece&s;&s;ity, or at lea&s;t &s;trongly incited by ambition and avarice, to employ every talent they po&s;&s;e&s;s. After a hi&s;tory of &s;ome thou&s;and years employed in manufacture and commerce, the inhabitants of China are &s;till the mo&s;t laborious and indu&s;trious of any people on the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>SOME part of this ob&s;ervation may be extend|ed to the elegant and literary arts. They too have their materials, which cannot be exhau&s;ted, and proceed from de&s;ires which cannot be &s;atiated. But the re&s;pect paid to literary merit is fluctuating, and matter of tran&s;ient fa&s;hion. When learned productions accumulate, the acqui&s;ition of know|ledge occupies the time that might be be&s;towed on invention. The object of mere learning is at|tained with moderate or inferior talents, and the growing li&s;t of pretenders dimini&s;hes the lu&s;tre of the few who are eminent. When we only mean to learn what others have taught, it is probable, that even our knowledge will be le&s;s than that of our ma&s;ters. Great names continue to be repeat|ed with admiration, after we have cea&s;ed to ex|amine the foundations of our prai&s;e; and new pre|tenders are rejected, not becau&s;e they fall &s;hort of their predece&s;&s;ors, but becau&s;e they do not ex|cel them; or becau&s;e, in reality, we have, with|out examination, taken for granted the merit of the fir&s;t, and cannot judge of either.</P>

<P>IN &s;imple or barbarous ages, when nations are weak, and be&s;et with enemies, the love of a coun|try, of a party, or a faction, are the &s;ame. The public is a knot of friends, and its enemies are the re&s;t of mankind. Death, or &s;lavery, are the ordinary evils which they are concerned to ward off; victory and dominion, the objects to which they a&s;pire. Under the &s;en&s;e of what they may &s;uffer from foreign inva&s;ions, it is one object, in every pro&s;perous &s;ociety, to increa&s;e its force, and to extend its limits. In proportion as this object is gained, &s;ecurity increa&s;es. They who po&s;&s;e&s;s the interior di&s;tricts, remote from the frontier, are unu&s;ed to alarms from abroad. They who are placed on the extremities, remote from the &s;eats of government, are unu&s;ed to hear of political in|tere&s;ts; and the public becomes an object per|haps too exten&s;ive, for the conceptions of either. They enjoy the protection of its laws, or of its armies; and they boa&s;t of its &s;plendor, and its power; but the glowing &s;entiments of public affection, which, in &s;mall &s;tates, mingle with the tenderne&s;s of the parent and the lover, of the friend and the companion, merely by having their ob|ject enlarged, lo&s;e great part of their force.</P>
<P>THE manners of rude nations require to be reformed. Their foreign quarrels, and dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions, are the operations of extreme and &s;an|guinary

pa&s;&s;ions. A &s;tate of greater tranquility hath many happy effects. But if nations pur&s;ue the plan of enlargement and pacification, till their members can no longer apprehend the common ties of &s;ociety, nor be engaged by affection in the cau&s;e of their country, they mu&s;t err on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide, and by leaving too little to agitate the &s;pirits of men, bring on ages of languor, if not of decay.</P>
<P>THE members of a community may, in this manner, like the inhabitants of a conquered pro|vince, be made to lo&s;e the &s;en&s;e of every connec|tion, but that of kindred or neighbourhood; and have no common affairs to tran&s;act, but tho&s;e of trade: Connections, indeed, or tran&s;actions, in which probity and friend&s;hip may &s;till take place; but in which the national &s;pirit, who&s;e ebbs and flows we are now con&s;idering, cannot be exerted.</P>
<P>WHAT we ob&s;erve, however, on the tendency of enlargement to loo&s;en the bands of political union, cannot be applied to nations who, being originally narrow, never greatly extended their limits, nor to tho&s;e who, in a rude &s;tate, had al|ready the exten&s;ion of a great kingdom.</P>
<P>IN territories of con&s;iderable extent, &s;ubject to one government, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, the national union, in rude ages, is extremely imper|fect. Every di&s;trict forms a &s;eparate party; and the de&s;cendents of different families are oppo&s;ed to one another, under the denomination of <HI>tribes</HI> or of <HI>clans:</HI> they are &s;eldom brought to act with a &s;teady concert; their feuds and animo&s;ities give more frequently the appearance of &s;o many nations

at war, than of a people united by connections of policy. They acquire a &s;pirit, however, in their private divi&s;ions, and in the mid&s;t of a di&s;order, otherwi&s;e hurtful, of which the force, on many occa&s;ions, redounds to the power of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the national extent, civil order, and regular government, are advantages of the greate&s;t importance; but it does not follow, that every arrangement made to obtain the&s;e ends, and which may, in the making, exerci&s;e and culti|vate the be&s;t qualities of men, is therefore of a nature to produce permanent effects, and to &s;ecure the pre&s;ervation of that national &s;pirit from which it aro&s;e.</P>
<P>WE have rea&s;on to dread the political refine|ments of ordinary men, when we con&s;ider, that repo&s;e, or inaction it&s;elf, is in a great mea&s;ure their object; and that they would frequently model their governments, not merely to prevent inju&s;tice and error, but to prevent agitation and bu&s;tle; and by the barriers they rai&s;e again&s;t the evil actions of men, would prevent them from acting at all. Every di&s;pute of a free people, in the opinion of &s;uch politicians, amounts to di&s;order, and a breach of the national peace. What heart-burnings? What delay to affairs? What want of &s;ecrecy and di&s;|patch? What defect of police? Men of &s;uperior genius &s;ometimes &s;eem to imagine, that the vulgar have no title to act, or to think.

WE ea&s;ily learn to contract our opinions of what men may, in con&s;i&s;tence with public order, be &s;afely permitted to do. The agitations of a republic, and the licence of its members, &s;trike the &s;ubjects of monarchy with aver&s;ion and di&s;|gu&s;t. The freedom with which the European is left to traver&s;e the &s;treets and the fields, would appear to a Chine&s;e a &s;ure prelude to confu&s;ion and anarchy.

<P>IF the precautions which men thus take again&s;t each other be nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s their crimes, and do not ari&s;e from a corrupt ambition, or from cruel jealou&s;y in their rulers, the proceeding it&s;elf mu&s;t be applauded, as the be&s;t remedy of which the vices of men will admit. The viper mu&s;t be held at a di&s;tance, and the tyger chained. But if a rigorous policy, applied to en&s;lave, not to re|&s;train from crimes, has an actual tendency to cor|rupt the manners, and to extingui&s;h the &s;pirit of nations; if its &s;everities be applied to terminate the agitations of a free people, not to remedy their corruptions; if forms be often applauded as &s;alutary, becau&s;e they tend merely to &s;ilence the voice of mankind, or be condemned as pernicious, becau&s;e they allow this voice to be heard; we may expect that many of the boa&s;ted improvements of civil &s;ociety, will be mere devices to lay the poli|tical &s;pirit at re&s;t, and will chain up the active vir|tues more than the re&s;tle&s;s di&s;orders of men.</P>

IF to any people it be the avowed object of policy, in all its internal refinements, to &s;ecure the per&s;on and the property of the &s;ubject, without any regard to his political character, the con&s;ti|tution indeed may be free, but its members may likewi&s;e become unworthy of the freedom they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and unfit to pre&s;erve it. The effects of &s;uch a con&s;titution may be to immer&s;e all orders of men in their &s;eparate pur&s;uits of plea&s;ure, which they may now enjoy with little di&s;turbance; or of gain, which they may pre&s;erve without any atten|tion to the commonwealth.</P>
<P>IF this be the end of political &s;truggles, the de&s;ign, when executed, in &s;ecuring to the indivi|dual his e&s;tate, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, may put an end to the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e very virtues that were required in conducting its execution. A man, who, in concert with his fellow-&s;ubjects, contends with u&s;urpation in defence of his e&s;tate or his per&s;on, may find an exertion of great ge|nero&s;ity, and of a vigorous &s;pirit; but he who, under political e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;uppo&s;ed to be fully confirmed, betakes him, becau&s;e he is &s;afe, to the mere enjoyment of fortune, has in fact turned to a &s;ource of corruption the very advan|tages which the virtues of the other procured. Individuals, in certain ages, derive their protection chiefly from the &s;trength of the party to which they adhere; but in times of corruption, they flat|ter them&s;elves, that they may continue to derive from the public that &s;afety which, in former ages, they mu&s;t have owed to their own vigilance and &s;pirit, to the warm attachment of their friends, and to the exerci&s;e of every talent which could

render them re&s;pected, feared, or beloved. In one period, therefore, mere circum&s;tances &s;erve to excite the &s;pirit, and to pre&s;erve the manners of men; in another, great wi&s;dom and zeal for the good of mankind on the part of their leaders, are required for the &s;ame purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>ROME, it may be thought, did not die of a lethargy, nor peri&s;h by the remi&s;&s;ion of her poli|tical ardours at home. Her di&s;temper appeared of a nature more violent and acute. Yet if the vir|tues of Cato and of Brutus found an exerci&s;e in the dying hour of the republic, the neutrality, and the cautious retirement of Atticus, found its &s;e|curity in the &s;ame tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on; and the great body of the people lay undi&s;turbed, below the current of a &s;torm, by which the &s;uperior ranks of men were de&s;troyed. In the minds of the people, the &s;en&s;e of a public was defaced; and even the animo&s;ity of faction had &s;ub&s;ided: they only could &s;hare in the commotion, who were the &s;oldiers of a legion, or the parti&s;ans of a leader. But this &s;tate fell not into ob&s;curity for want of eminent men. If at the time of which we &s;peak, we look only for a few names di&s;tingui&s;hed in the hi&s;tory of mankind, there is no period at which the li&s;t was more numerous. But tho&s;e names be|came di&s;tingi&s;hed in the conte&s;t for dominion, not in the exerci&s;e of equal rights: the people was corrupted; the empire of the known world &s;tood in need of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>REPUBLICAN governments, in general, are in hazard of ruin from the a&s;cendant of particular factions, and from the mutinous &s;pirit of a po|pulace, who being corrupted, are no longer fit to

&s;hare in the admini&s;tration of &s;tate. But under other e&s;tabli&s;hments, where liberty may be more &s;ucce&s;sfully attained if men are corrupted, the na|tional vigour declines from the abu&s;e of that very &s;ecurity which is procured by the &s;uppo&s;ed per|fection of public order.</P>
<P>A di&s;tribution of power and office; an execu|tion of law, by which mutual incroachments and mole&s;tations are brought to an end; by which the per&s;on and the property are, without friends, with|out cabal, without obligation, perfectly &s;ecured to in|dividuals, does honour to the genius of a nation; and could not have been fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, without tho&s;e exertions of under&s;tanding and integrity, tho&s;e trials of a re&s;olute and vigorous &s;pirit, which adorn the annals of a people, and leave to future ages a &s;ubject of ju&s;t admiration and applau&s;e. But if we &s;uppo&s;e that the end is attained, and that men no longer act, in the enjoyment of li|berty, from liberal &s;entiments, or with a view to the pre&s;ervation of public manners; if indivi|duals think them&s;elves &s;ecure without any atten|tion or effort of their own; this boa&s;ted advan|tage may be found only to give them an opportu|nity of enjoying, at lei&s;ure, the conveniencies and nece&s;&s;aries of life; or, in the language of Cato, teach them to value their hou&s;es, their villas, their &s;tatues, and their pictures, at a higher rate than they do the republic. They may be found to grow tired in &s;ecret of a free con&s;titution, of which they never cea&s;e to boa&s;t in their conver&s;a|tion, and which they always neglect in their con|duct.</P>

THE dangers to liberty are not the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration; but they can never be greater from any cau&s;e than they are from the &s;uppo&s;ed remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of a people, to who&s;e per&s;onal vigour every con&s;titution, as it owed its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, &s;o mu&s;t continue to owe its pre&s;ervation. Nor is this ble&s;&s;ing ever le&s;s &s;ecure than it is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of men who think that they enjoy it in &s;afety, and who therefore con&s;ider the public only as it pre&s;ents to their avarice a number of lu|crative employments; for the &s;ake of which they may &s;acrifice tho&s;e very rights which render them|&s;elves objects of management or con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>FROM the tendency of the&s;e reflections, then, it &s;hould appear, that a national &s;pirit is fre|quently tran&s;ient, not on account of any incurable di&s;temper in the nature of mankind, but on ac|count of their voluntary neglects and corruptions. This &s;pirit &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;olely, perhaps, in the exe|cution of a few projects, entered into for the ac|qui&s;ition of territory or wealth; it comes, like a u&s;ele&s;s weapon, to be laid a&s;ide after its end is at|tained.</P>
<P>ORDINARY e&s;tabli&s;hments terminate in a re|laxation of vigour, and are ineffectual to the pre|&s;ervation of &s;tates; becau&s;e they lead mankind to rely on their arts, in&s;tead of their virtues, and to mi&s;take for an improvement of human nature, a mere acce&s;&s;ion of accommodation, or of riches.

<PB N="339" REF="344">
other re&s;ources of war. They have done what we are very apt to admire; they have brought nati|onal affairs to the level of the meane&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">pacity; they have broke them into parts, and thrown them into &s;eparate departments; they have clothed every proceeding with &s;plendid ceremonies, and maje&s;|tical forms; and where the reverence of forms cannot repre&s;s di&s;order, a rigorous and &s;evere po|lice, armed with every &s;pecies of corporal puni&s;h|ment, is applied to the purpo&s;e. The whip, and the cudgel, are held up to all orders of men; they are at once employed, and they are dreaded by every magi&s;trate. A mandarine is whipped, for having ordered a pickpocket to receive too few or too many blows.</P>
<P>EVERY department of &s;tate is made the ob|ject of a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion, and every candidate for office mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed through a regular edu|cation; and, as in the graduations of the univer|&s;ity, mu&s;t have obtained by his proficiency, or his &s;tanding, the degree to which he a&s;pires. The tribunals of &s;tate, of war, and of the revenue, as well as of literature, are conducted by graduates in their different &s;tudies; but while learning is the great road to preferment, it terminates, in being able to read, and to write; and the great object of government con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing, and in con|&s;uming the fruits of the earth. With all the&s;e re&s;ources, and this learned preparation, which is made to turn the&s;e re&s;ources to u&s;e, the &s;tate is in reality weak; has repeatedly given the example which we &s;eek to explain; and among the doctors of war or of policy, among the millions who are &s;et apart for the military profe&s;&s;ion, can find none of its members who are fit to &s;tand forth in the
<PB N="340" REF="345">
dangers of their country, or to form a defence a|gain&s;t the repeated inroads of an enemy reputed to be artle&s;s and mean.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to tell how long the decay of &s;tates might be &s;u&s;pended by the cultivation of arts on which their real felicity and &s;trength de|pend; by cultivating in the higher ranks tho&s;e talents for the council and the field, which cannot, without great di&s;advantage, be &s;eparated; and in the body of a people, that zeal for their country, and that military character, which enable them to take a &s;hare in defending its rights.</P>
<P>TIMES may come, when every proprietor mu&s;t defend his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and every free people maintain their own independence. We may ima|gine, that again&s;t &s;uch an extremity, an army of hired troops is a &s;ufficient precaution; but their own troops are the very enemy again&s;t which a people is &s;ometimes obliged to fight. We may flatter our&s;elves, that extremities of this &s;ort, in any particular ca&s;e, are remote; but we cannot, in rea&s;oning on the general fortunes of mankind, avoid putting the ca&s;e, and referring to the ex|amples in which it has happened. It has hap|pened in every in&s;tance where the poli&s;hed have fallen a prey to the rude, and where the pacific inhabitant has been reduced to &s;ubjection by mili|tary force.</P>
<P>IF the de&s;ence and government of a people be made to depend on a few, who make the conduct of &s;tate or of war their profe&s;&s;ion; whether the&s;e be foreigners or natives; whether they be called away of a &s;udden, like the Roman legion from
<PB N="341" REF="346">
Britain; whether they turn again&s;t their employ|ers, like the army of Carthage, or be overpow|ered and di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;troke of fortune, the multitude of a cowardly and undi&s;ciplined people mu&s;t, on &s;uch an emergence, receive a foreign or a dome&s;tic enemy, as they would a plague or an earthquake, with hopele&s;s amazement and terror, and by their numbers, only &s;well the triumphs, and enrich the &s;poil of a conqueror.</P>
<P>STATESMEN and leaders of armies, accu&s;tomed to the mere ob&s;ervance of forms, are di&s;concerted by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of cu&s;tomary rules; and on &s;light grounds de&s;pair of their country. They were qualified only to go the rounds of a particular track; and when forced from their &s;tations, are in reality unable to act with men. They only took part in formalities, of which they under&s;tood not the tendency; and together with the modes of pro|cedure, even the very &s;tate it&s;elf, in their appre|hen&s;ion, has cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. The numbers, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and re&s;ources of a great people, only &s;erve, in their view, to con&s;titute a &s;cene of hopele&s;s confu&s;ion and terror.</P>
<P>IN rude ages, under the appellations of <HI>a com|munity, a people,</HI> or <HI>a nation,</HI> was under&s;tood a number of men; and the &s;tate, while its mem|bers remained, was accounted entire. The Scy|thians, while they fled before Darius, mocked at his childi&s;h attempt; Athens &s;urvived the deva&s;|tations of Xerxes; and Rome, in its rude &s;tate, tho&s;e of the Gauls. With poli&s;hed and mercan|tile &s;tates, the ca&s;e is &s;ometimes rever&s;ed. The nation is a territory, cultivated and improved by
<PB N="342" REF="347">
its owners; de&s;troy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even while the ma&s;ter remains, the &s;tate is undone.</P>
<P>THAT weakne&s;s and effeminacy of which po|li&s;hed nations are &s;ometimes accu&s;ed, has it place probably in the mind alone. The &s;trength of ani|mals, and that of man in particular, depends on his feeding, and the kind of labour to which he is u&s;ed. Whole&s;ome food, and hard labour, the portion of many in every poli&s;hed and commercial nation, &s;ecure to the public a number of men en|dued with bodily &s;trength, and inured to hard&s;hip and toil.</P>
<P>EVEN delicate living, and good accommodation, are not found to enervate the body. The armies of Europe have been obliged to make the experi|ment; and the children of opulent families, bred in effeminacy, or nur&s;ed with tender care, have been made to contend with the &s;avage. By imi|tating his arts, they have learned, like him, to traver&s;e the fore&s;t; and, in every &s;ea&s;on, to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in the de&s;ert. They have, perhaps, recovered a le&s;&s;on, which it has co&s;t civilized nations many ages to unlearn, That the fortune of a man is entire while he remains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT may be thought, however, that few of the celebrated nations of antiquity, who&s;e fate has given ri&s;e to &s;o much reflection on the vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs, had made any great progre&s;s in tho&s;e enervating arts we have mentioned; or made tho&s;e arrangements from which the danger in que&s;tion could be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e. The Greeks, in particular, at the time of their fall under the Macedonian yoke, had certainly not carried the
<PB N="343" REF="348">
commercial arts to &s;o great a height as is common with the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and pro&s;perous nations of Europe. They had &s;till retained the form of independent republics; the people were generally admitted to a &s;hare in the government; and not being able to hire armies, they were obliged, by nece&s;&s;ity, to bear a part in the defence of their country. By their frequent wars and dome&s;tic commotions, they were accu&s;tomed to danger, and were familiar with alarming &s;ituations: they were accordingly &s;till accounted the be&s;t &s;oldiers and the be&s;t &s;tate&s;men of the known world. The younger Cyrus promi&s;ed him&s;elf the empire of A&s;ia by means of their aid; and after his fall, a body of ten thou&s;and, although bereft of their leaders, baf|fled, in their retreat, all the military force of the Per&s;ian empire. The victor of A&s;ia did not think him&s;elf prepared for that conque&s;t, till he had formed an army from the &s;ubdued republics of Greece.</P>
<P>IT is, however, true, that in the age of Philip, the military and political &s;pirit of tho&s;e nations appears to have been con&s;iderably impaired, and to have &s;uffered, perhaps, from the variety of in|tere&s;ts and pur&s;uits, as well as of plea&s;ures, with which their members came to be occupied: they even made a kind of &s;eparation between the civil and military character. Phocion, we are told by Plutarch, having ob&s;erved that the leading men of his time followed different cour&s;es, that &s;ome applied them&s;elves to civil, others to military af|fairs, determined rather to follow the examples of Themi&s;tocles, Ari&s;tides, and Pericles, the leaders of a former age, who were equally prepared for either.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="349">
WE find in the orations of Demo&s;thenes, a perpetual reference to this &s;tate of manners. We find him exhorting the Athenians, not only to declare war, but to arm them&s;elves for the execu|tion of their own military plans. We find that there was an order of military men, who ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice of one &s;tate to that of an|other; and who, when they were neglected at home, turned away to enterpri&s;es on their own ac|count. There were not, perhaps, better warriors in any former age; but tho&s;e warriors were not attached to any &s;tate; and the &s;ettled inhabitants of every city thought them&s;elves di&s;qualified for military &s;ervice. The di&s;cipline of armies was perhaps improved; but the vigour of nations was gone to decay. When Philip, or Alexander, de|feated the Grecian armies, which were chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers of fortune, they found an ea&s;y conque&s;t with the other inhabitants: and when the latter, afterwards &s;upported by tho&s;e &s;oldiers, invaded the Per&s;ian empire, he &s;eems to have left little martial &s;pirit behind him; and by removing the military men, to have taken precau|tion enough, in his ab&s;ence, to &s;ecure his domi|nion over this mutinous and refractory people.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubdivi&s;ion of arts and profe&s;&s;ions, in cer|tain examples, tends to improve the practice of them, and to promote their ends. By having &s;eparated the arts of the clothier and the tanner, we are the better &s;upplied with &s;hoes and with cloth. But to &s;eparate the arts which form the citizen and the &s;tate&s;man, the arts of policy and war, is an attempt to di&s;member the human cha|racter, and to de&s;troy tho&s;e very arts we mean to
<PB N="345" REF="350">
improve. By this &s;eparation, we in effect deprive a free people of what is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;afety; or we prepare a defence again&s;t inva&s;ions from a|broad, which gives a pro&s;pect of u&s;urpation, and threatens the e&s;tabli&s;hment of military government at home.</P>
<P>WE may be &s;urpri&s;ed to find the beginning of certain military in&s;tructions at Rome, referred to a time no earlier than that of the Cimbric war. It was then, we are told by Valerius Maximus, that Roman &s;oldiers were made to learn from gladiators the u&s;e of a &s;word: and the antagoni&s;ts of Phyrrhus and of Hannibal were, by the account of this writer, &s;till in need of in&s;truction in the fir&s;t rudiments of their trade. They had already, by the order and choice of their incampments, im|pre&s;&s;ed the Grecian invader with awe and re&s;pect; they had already, not by their victories, but by their national vigour and firmne&s;s, under repeated defeats, induced him to &s;ue for peace. But the haughty Roman, perhaps, knew the advantage of order and of union, without having been broke to the inferior arts of the mercenary &s;oldier; and had the courage to face the enemies of his coun|try, without having practi&s;ed the u&s;e of his wea|pon under the fear of being whipped. He could ill be per&s;uaded, that a time might come, when refined and intelligent nations would make the art of war to con&s;i&s;t in a few technical forms; that citizens and &s;oldiers might come to be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed as much as women and men; that the citizen would become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a property which he would not be able, or required, to defend; that the &s;oldier would be appointed to keep for another what he would be taught to de&s;ire, and what he
<PB N="346" REF="351">
would be enabled to &s;eize for him&s;elf; that, in &s;hort, one &s;et of men were to have an intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, without the power to defend them; that the other were to have this power, without either the inclination or the intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS people, however, by degrees came to put their military force on the very footing to which this de&s;cription alludes. Marius made a ca|pital change in the manner of levying &s;oldiers at Rome: He filled his legions with the mean and the indigent, who depended on military pay for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; he created a force which re&s;ted on mere di&s;cipline alone, and the &s;kill of the gladia|tor; he taught his troops to employ their &s;words again&s;t the con&s;titution of their country, and &s;et the example of a practice which was &s;oon adopted and improved by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THE Romans only meant by their armies to incroach on the freedom of other nations, while they pre&s;erved their own. They forgot, that in a&s;&s;embling &s;oldiers of fortune, and in &s;uffering any leader to be ma&s;ter of a di&s;ciplined army, they actually re&s;igned their political rights, and &s;uffered a ma&s;ter to ari&s;e for the &s;tate. This people, in &s;hort, who&s;e ruling pa&s;&s;ion was depredation and conque&s;t, peri&s;hed by the recoil of an engine which they them&s;elves had erected again&s;t man|kind.</P>
<P>THE boa&s;ted refinements, then, of the poli&s;hed age, are not dive&s;ted of danger. They open a door, perhaps, to di&s;a&s;ter, as wide and acce&s;&s;ible as any of tho&s;e they have &s;hut. If they build walls
<PB N="347" REF="352">
and ramparts, they enervate the minds of tho&s;e who are placed to defend them; if they form di&s;ciplined armies, they reduce the military &s;pirit of entire nations; and by placing the &s;word where they have given a di&s;ta&s;te to civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, they prepare for mankind the government of force.</P>
<P>IT is happy for the nations of Europe, that the di&s;parity between the &s;oldier and the pacific citizen can never be &s;o great as it became among the Greeks and the Romans. In the u&s;e of modern arms, the novice is made to learn, and to practi&s;e with ea&s;e, all that the veteran knows; and if to teach him were a matter of real difficulty, happy are they who are not deterred by &s;uch difficulties, and who can di&s;cover the arts which tend to fortify and pre&s;erve, not to enervate and ruin their coun|try.</P>

<HEAD>Of National Wa&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;trength of nations con&s;i&s;ts in the wealth, the numbers, and the character, of their people. The hi&s;tory of their progre&s;s from a &s;tate of rudene&s;s, is, for the mo&s;t part, a de|tail of the &s;truggles they have maintained, and of the arts they have practi&s;ed, to &s;trengthen, or to &s;ecure them&s;elves. Their conque&s;ts, their po|pulation, and their commerce, their civil and mi|litary arrangements, their &s;kill in the con&s;truction of weapons, and in the methods of attack and de|fence; the very di&s;tribution of ta&s;ks, whether in private bu&s;ine&s;s or in public affairs, either tend to be&s;tow, or promi&s;e to employ with advantage, the con&s;tituents of a national force, and the re|&s;ources of war.</P>
<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e, that together with the&s;e ad|vantages, the military character of a people re|mains, or is improved, it mu&s;t follow, that what is gained in civilization, is a real increa&s;e of &s;trength; and that the ruin of nations could never take its ri&s;e from them&s;elves. Where &s;tates have &s;topped &s;hort in their progre&s;s, or have actually gone to decay, we may &s;u&s;pect, that however di&s;po&s;ed to advance, they have found a limit, be|yond which they could not proceed; or from a remi&s;&s;ion of the national &s;pirit, and a weakne&s;s of
<PB N="349" REF="354">
character, were unable to make the mo&s;t of their re&s;ources, and natural advantages. On this &s;uppo|&s;ition, from being &s;tationary, they may begin to relap&s;e, and by a retrograde motion, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of ages, arrive at a &s;tate of greater weakne&s;s, than that which they quitted in the beginning of their progre&s;s; and with the appearance of better arts, and &s;uperior conduct, expo&s;e them&s;elves to become a prey to barbarians, whom, in the at|tainment, or the height of their glory, they had ea&s;ily baffled or de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the natural wealth of a people, or whatever may be the limits beyond which they cannot improve on their &s;tock, it is probable, that no nation has ever reached tho&s;e limits, or has been able to po&s;tpone its misfor|tunes, and effects of mi&s;conduct, until its fund of materials, and the fertility of its &s;oil, were exhau&s;ted, or the numbers of its people were great|ly reduced. The &s;ame errors in policy, and weak|ne&s;s of manners, which prevent the proper u&s;e of re&s;ources, likewi&s;e check their increa&s;e, or im|provement.</P>
<P>THE wealth of the &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ortune of its members. The actual revenue of the &s;tate is that &s;hare of every private fortune, which the public has been accu&s;tomed to demand for na|tional purpo&s;es. This revenue cannot be always proportioned to what may be &s;uppo&s;ed redundant in the private e&s;tate, but to what is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, thought &s;o by the owner; and to what he may be made to &s;pare, without intrenching on his manner of living, and without &s;u&s;pending his pro|jects of expence, or of commerce. It &s;hould ap|pear,
<PB N="350" REF="355">
therefore, that any immoderate increa&s;e of private expence is a prelude to national weakne&s;s: government, even while each of its &s;ubjects con|&s;umes a princely e&s;tate, may be &s;traitened in point of revenue, and the paradox be explained by ex|ample, That the public is poor, while its members are rich.</P>
<P>WE are frequently led into error by mi&s;tak|ing money for riches; we think that a people cannot be impoveri&s;hed by a wa&s;te of Money which is &s;pent among them&s;elves. The fact is, that men are impoveri&s;hed, only in two ways; either by having their gains &s;u&s;pended, or by hav|ing their &s;ub&s;tance con&s;umed; and money expend|ed at home, being circulated, and not con&s;umed, cannot, any more than the exchange of a tally, or a counter, among a certain number of hands, tend to dimini&s;h the wealth of the company a|mong whom it is handed about. But while money circulates at home, the nece&s;&s;aries of life, which are the real con&s;tituents of wealth, may be idly con&s;umed; the indu&s;try which might be employ|ed to increa&s;e the &s;tock of a people, may be &s;u&s;|pended, or turned to abu&s;e.</P>
<P>GREAT armies, maintained either at home or abroad, without any national object, are &s;o many mouths unnece&s;&s;arily opened to wa&s;te the &s;tores of the public, and &s;o many hands with-held from the arts by which its profits are made. Un|&s;ucce&s;sful enterpri&s;es are &s;o many ventures thrown away, and lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained, proportioned to the capital employed in the &s;ervice. The Helvetii in order to invade the Roman province of Gaul, burnt their habitations, dropt their in&s;truments of
<PB N="351" REF="356">
hu&s;bandry, and con&s;umed, in one year, the &s;av|ings of many. The enterpri&s;e failed of &s;ucce&s;s, and the nation was undone.</P>
<P>STATES have endeavoured, in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, by pawning their credit, in&s;tead of employing their capital, to di&s;gui&s;e the hazards they ran. They have found, in the loans they rai&s;ed, a ca|&s;ual re&s;ource, which encouraged their enterpri&s;es. They have &s;eemed, by their manner of erecting transferrable funds, to leave the capital for pur|po&s;es of trade, in the hands of the &s;ubject, while it is actually expended by the government. They have, by the&s;e means proceeded to the execution of great national projects, without &s;u&s;pending pri|vate indu&s;try, and have left future ages to an&s;wer, in part, for debts contracted with a view to fu|ture emolument. So far the expedient is plau&s;ible, and appears to be ju&s;t. The growing burden too, is thus gradually laid; and if a nation be to &s;ink in &s;ome future age, every mini&s;ter hopes it may &s;till keep afloat in his own. But the mea&s;ure, for this very rea&s;on, is, with all its advantages, ex|tremely dangerous, in the hands of a precipitant and ambitious admini&s;tration, regarding only the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and imagining a &s;tate to be in|exhau&s;tible, while a capital can be borrowed, and the intere&s;t be paid.</P>
<P>WE are told of a nation, who, during a cer|tain period, rivalled the glories of the ancient world, threw off the dominion of a ma&s;ter armed again&s;t them with the powers of a great kingdom, broke the yoke with which they had been op|pre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t within the cour&s;e of a century, rai&s;ed, by their indu&s;try and national vigour, a
<PB N="352" REF="357">
new and formidable power, which &s;truck the for|mer potentates of Europe with awe and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and turned the badges of poverty with which they &s;et out, into the en&s;igns of war and dominion. This end was attained by the great efforts of a &s;pirit awaked by oppre&s;&s;ion, by a &s;ucce&s;sful pur&s;uit of national wealth, and by a rapid anticipation of future revenue. But this illu&s;trious &s;tate is &s;up|po&s;ed, not only in the language of a former &s;ec|tion, to have preoccupied the bu&s;ine&s;s; they have &s;eque&s;tered the inheritance of many ages to come.</P>
<P>GREAT national expence, however, does not imply the nece&s;&s;ity of any national &s;uffering. While revenue is applied with &s;ucce&s;s, to obtain &s;ome valuable end; the profits of every adventure, be|ing more than &s;ufficient to repay its co&s;ts, the pub|lic &s;hould gain, and its re&s;ources &s;hould continue to multiply. But an expence, whether &s;u&s;tained at home or abroad, whether a wa&s;te of the pre|&s;ent, or an anticipation of future, revenue, if it bring no proper return, is to be reckoned among the cau&s;es of national ruin.</P>

<PB N="355" REF="360">
who, in &s;trict oeconomy, may be reckoned &s;uperfluous, on the civil, the military, and the po|litical li&s;t; but becau&s;e we are men, and prefer the occupation, improvement, and felicity of our nature, to its mere exi&s;tence, we mu&s;t even wi&s;h, that as many members as po&s;&s;ible, of every com|munity, may be admitted to a &s;hare of its de|fence and its government.</P>
<P>MEN, in fact, while they pur&s;ue in &s;ociety different objects, or &s;eparate views, procure a wide di&s;tribution of power, and by a &s;pecies of chance, arrive at a po&s;ture for civil engagements, more favourable to human nature than what hu|man wi&s;dom could ever calmly devi&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the &s;trength of a nation, in the mean time, con&s;i&s;ts in the men on whom it may rely, and who are fortunately or wi&s;ely combined for its pre&s;ervation, it follows, that manners are as im|portant as either numbers or wealth; and that corruption is to be accounted a principal cau&s;e of national declen&s;ion and ruin.</P>
<P>WHOEVER perceives what are the qualities of man in his excellence, may ea&s;ily, by that &s;tandard, di&s;tingui&s;h his defects or corruptions. If an intelligent, a courageous, and an affection|ate mind, con&s;titutes the perfection of his na|ture, remarkable failings in any of tho&s;e particu|lars, mu&s;t proportionally &s;ink or deba&s;e his cha|racter.</P>
<P>WE have ob&s;erved, that it is the happine&s;s of the individual to make a right choice of his con|duct; that this choice will lead him to lo&s;e in

&s;ociety the &s;en&s;e of a per&s;onal intere&s;t; and, in the con&s;ideration of what is due to the whole, to &s;tifie tho&s;e anxieties which relate to him&s;elf as a part.</P>
<P>THE natural di&s;po&s;ition of man to humanity, and the warmth of his temper, may rai&s;e his cha|racter to this fortunate pitch. His elevation, in a great mea&s;ure depends on the form of his &s;ociety; but he can, without incurring the charge of cor|ruption, accommodate him&s;elf to great variations in the con&s;titutions of government. The &s;ame integrity, and vigorous &s;pirit, which, in demo|cratical &s;tates renders him tenacious of his equa|lity, may, under ari&s;tocracy or monarchy, lead him to maintain the &s;ubordinations e&s;tabli&s;hed. He may entertain, towards the different ranks of men with whom he is yoked in the &s;tate, maxims of re&s;pect and of candour: he may, in the choice of his actions, follow a principle of ju&s;tice, and of honour, which the con&s;iderations of &s;afety, pre|ferment, or profit, cannot efface.</P>
<P>FROM our complaints of national depravity, it &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, appear, that whole bodies of men are &s;ometimes infected with an epidemical weakne&s;s of the head, or corruption of heart, by which they become unfit for the &s;ta|tions they occupy, and threaten the &s;tates they compo&s;e, however flouri&s;hing, with a pro&s;pect of decay, and of ruin.</P>
<P>A CHANGE of national manners for the wor&s;e, may ari&s;e from a di&s;continuance of the &s;cenes in which the talents of men were happily cultivated, and brought into exerci&s;e; or from a change in
<PB N="357" REF="362">
the prevailing opinions relating to the con&s;tituents of honour or of happine&s;s. When mere riches, or court-favour, are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute rank; the mind is mi&s;led from the con&s;ideration of qua|lities on which it ought to rely. Magnanimity, courage, and the love of mankind, are &s;acrificed to avarice and vanity, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed under a &s;en&s;e of dependence. The individual con&s;iders his com|munity &s;o far only as it can be rendered &s;ub&s;er|vient to his per&s;onal advancement or profit: he &s;tates him&s;elf in competition with his fellow-crea|tures; and, urged by the pa&s;&s;ions of emulation, of fear and jealou&s;y, of envy and malice, he fol|lows the maxims of an animal de&s;tined to pre|&s;erve his &s;eparate exi&s;tence, and to indulge his caprice or his appetite, at the expence of his &s;pecies.</P>
<P>ON this corrupt foundation, men become ei|ther rapacious, deceitful, and violent, ready to tre&s;pa&s;s on the rights of others; or &s;ervile, merce|nary, and ba&s;e, prepared to relinqui&s;h their own. Talents, capacity, and force of mind, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on of the fir&s;t de&s;cription, &s;erve to plunge him the deeper in mi&s;ery, and to &s;harpen the agony of cruel pa&s;&s;ions; which lead him to wreak on his fellow-creatures the torments that prey on him&s;elf. To a per&s;on of the &s;econd, imagination, and rea&s;on it&s;elf, only &s;erve to point out fal&s;e ob|jects of fear, or de&s;ire, and to multiply the &s;ub|jects of di&s;appointment, and of momentary joy. In either ca&s;e, and whether we &s;uppo&s;e that cor|rupt men are urged by covetou&s;ne&s;s, or betrayed by fear, and without &s;pecifying the crimes which from either di&s;po&s;ition they are prepared to com|mit, we may &s;afely affirm, with Socrates,
<Q>That
<PB N="358" REF="363">
every ma&s;ter &s;hould pray he may not meet with &s;uch a &s;lave; and every &s;uch per&s;on, being un|fit for liberty, &s;hould implore that he may meet with a merciful ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>MAN, under this mea&s;ure of corruption, al|though he may be bought for a &s;lave by tho&s;e who know how to turn his faculties and his labour to profit; and although, when kept under proper re&s;traints, his neighbourhood may be convenient or u&s;eful; yet is certainly unfit to act on the footing of a liberal combination or concert with his fellow-creatures: his mind is not addicted to friend&s;hip or confidence; he is not willing to act for the pre&s;ervation of others, nor de&s;erves that any other &s;hould hazard his own &s;afety for his.</P>
<P>THE actual character of mankind, mean-time, in the wor&s;t, as well as the be&s;t condition, is un|doubtedly mixed: and nations of the be&s;t de&s;crip|tion are greatly obliged for their pre&s;ervation, not only to the good di&s;po&s;ition of their members, but likewi&s;e to tho&s;e political in&s;titutions, by which the violent are re&s;trained from the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, and the cowardly, or the &s;elfi&s;h, are made to contribute their part to the public defence or pro&s;perity. By means of &s;uch in&s;titutions, and the wi&s;e precautions of government, nations are en|abled to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and even to pro&s;per, under very different degrees of corruption, or of public in|tegrity.</P>
<P>SO long as the majority of a people is &s;uppo&s;ed to act on maxims of probity, the example of the good, and even the caution of the bad, give a general appearance of integrity and of innocence
<PB N="359" REF="364">
Where men are to one another objects of affection and of confidence, where they are generally di&s;|po&s;ed not to offend, government may be remi&s;s; and every per&s;on may be treated as innocent, till he is found to be guilty. As the &s;ubject in this ca&s;e does not hear of the crimes, &s;o he need not be told of the puni&s;hments inflicted on per&s;ons of a different character. But where the manners of a people are con&s;iderably changed for the wor&s;e, e|very &s;ubject mu&s;t &s;tand on his guard, and govern|ment it&s;elf mu&s;t act on &s;uitable maxims of fear and di&s;tru&s;t. The individual, no longer fit to be indulged in his preten&s;ions to per&s;onal con&s;iderati|on, independence, or freedom, each of which he would turn to abu&s;e, mu&s;t be taught, by external force, and from motives of fear, to counterfeit tho&s;e effects of innocence, and of duty, to which he is not di&s;po&s;ed: he mu&s;t be re&s;erred to the whip, or the gibbet, for arguments in &s;upport of a caution, which the &s;tate now requires him to a&s;|&s;ume, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that he is in&s;en&s;ible to the motives which recommend the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>THE rules of de&s;poti&s;m are made for the go|vernment of corrupted men. They were indeed followed on &s;ome remarkable occa&s;ions, even un|der the Roman common-wealth; and the bloody axe, to terrify the citizen from his crimes, and to repel the ca&s;ual and temporary irruptions of vice, was repeatedly committed to the arbitrary will of the dictator. They were finally e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of the republic it&s;elf when either the people became too corrupted for freedom, or when the magi&s;trate became too corrupted to re&s;ign his dictatorial power. This &s;pecies of government comes naturally in the termination of a continued
<PB N="360" REF="365">
and growing corruption; but has no doubt, in &s;ome in&s;tances, come too &s;oon, and has &s;acrificed remains of virtue, that de&s;erved a better fate, to the jealou&s;y of tyrants, who were in ha&s;te to aug|ment their power. This method of government cannot, in &s;uch ca&s;es, fail to introduce that mea|&s;ure of corruption, again&s;t who&s;e external effects it is de&s;ired as a remedy. When fear is &s;ug|ge&s;ted as the only motive to duty, every heart becomes rapacious or ba&s;e. And this medicine, if applied to a healthy body, is &s;ure to create the di&s;temper it is de&s;tined to cure.</P>
<P>THIS is the manner of government into which the covetous, and the arrogant, to &s;atiate their unhappy de&s;ires, would hurry their fellow-crea|tures: it is a manner of government to which the timorous and the &s;ervile &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion; and when the&s;e characters of the rapacious and the timid divide mankind, even the virtues of Anto|ninus or Trajan, can do no more than apply, with candour and with vigour, the whip and the &s;word; and endeavour, by the hopes of reward, or the fear of puni&s;hment, to find a &s;peedy and a temporary cure for the crimes, or the imbecili|ties of men.</P>
<P>OTHER &s;tates may be more or le&s;s corrupt|ed: this has corruption for its ba&s;is. Here ju&s;|tice may &s;ometimes direct the arm of the de|&s;potical &s;overeign; but the name of ju&s;tice is mo&s;t commonly employed to &s;ignify the intere&s;t, or the caprice, of a reigning power. Human &s;ociety, &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch a variety of forms, here finds the &s;imple&s;t of all. The toils and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of many are de&s;tined to a&s;&s;wage the pa&s;&s;ions of one
<PB N="361" REF="366">
or a few; and the only parties that remain among mankind, are the oppre&s;&s;or who demands, and the oppre&s;&s;ed who dare not refu&s;e.</P>
<P>NATIONS, while they were intitled to a mild|er fate, as in the ca&s;e of the Greeks, repeatedly conquered, have been reduced to this condition by military force. They have reached it too in the maturity of their own depravations; when, like the Romans, returned from the conque&s;t, and loaded with the &s;poils, of the world, they gave loo&s;e to &s;action, and to crimes too bold and too frequent for the correction of ordinary government; and when the &s;word of ju&s;tice, dropping with blood, and perpetually required to &s;uppre&s;s accu|mulating di&s;orders on every &s;ide, could no longer await the delays and precautions of an admini&s;tra|tion fettered by laws.</P>
<P>IT is, however, well known from the hi&s;tory of mankind, that corruption of this, or of any other degree, is not peculiar to nations in their decline, or in the re&s;ult of &s;ignal pro&s;perity, and great ad|vances in the arts of commerce. The bands of &s;ociety, indeed, in &s;mall and infant e&s;tabli&s;hments, are generally &s;trong; and their &s;ubjects, either by an ardent devotion to their own tribe, or a vehe|ment animo&s;ity again&s;t enemies, and by a vigo|rous courage founded on both, are well qualified to urge, or to &s;u&s;tain, the fortune of a growing community. But the &s;avage, and the barbarian, have given, notwith&s;tanding, in the ca&s;e of entire nations, &s;ome examples of a weak and timorous character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The barbarous nations of Siberia, in general, are &s;ervile and timid.</NOTE>. They have in more in&s;tances, fallen
<PB N="362" REF="367">
into that &s;pecies of corruption which we have al|ready de&s;cribed in treating of barbarous nations; they have made rapine their trade, not merely as a &s;pecies of warfare, or with a view to enrich their community, but to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in property, what they learned to prefer even to the ties of affection or of blood.</P>
<P>IN the lowe&s;t &s;tate of commercial arts, the pa&s;|&s;ions for wealth, and for dominion, have exhibit|ed &s;cenes of oppre&s;&s;ion, or &s;ervility, which the mo&s;t fini&s;hed corruption of the arrogant, the cow|ardly, and the mercenary, founded on the de&s;ire of procuring, or the fear of lo&s;ing, a fortune, could not exceed. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the vices of men, un|re&s;trained by forms, and unawed by police, are &s;uffered to riot at large, and to produce their en|tire effects. Parties accordingly unite, or &s;eparate, on the maxims of a gang of robbers; they &s;acri|fice to intere&s;t the tendere&s;t affections of human nature. The parent &s;upplies the market for &s;laves, even by the &s;ale of his own children; the cottage cea&s;es to be a &s;anctuary for the weak and the defencele&s;s &s;tranger; and rites of ho&s;pitality, of|ten &s;o &s;acred among nations in their primitive &s;tate, come to be violated, like every other tie of humanity, without fear or remor&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chardin's travel's through Mingrelia into Per&s;ia.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NATIONS, which in later periods of their hi&s;|tory became eminent for civil wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, had, perhaps, in a former age, paroxy&s;ms of law|le&s;s di&s;order, to which this de&s;cription might in part be applied. The very policy by which they arrived at their degree of national felicity, was devi&s;ed as a remedy for outrageous abu&s;e. The
<PB N="363" REF="368">
e&s;tabli&s;hment of order was dated from the com|mi&s;&s;ion of rapes and murders; indignation, and private revenge, were the principles on which na|tions proceeded to the expul&s;ion of tyrants, to the emancipation of mankind, and the full expla|nation of their political rights.</P>
<P>DEFECTS of government, and of law, may be in &s;ome ca&s;es con&s;idered as a &s;ymptom of inno|cence and of virtue. But where power is already e&s;tabli&s;hed, where the &s;trong are unwilling to &s;uf|fer re&s;traint, or the weak unable to find a pro|tection, the defects of law are marks of the mo&s;t perfect corruption.</P>
<P>AMONG rude nations, government is often de|fective; both becau&s;e men are not yet acquaint|ed with all the evils for which poli&s;hed nations have endeavoured to find a redre&s;s; and becau&s;e, even where evils of the mo&s;t flagrant nature have long afflicted the peace of &s;ociety, they have not yet been able to apply the cure. In the progre&s;s of civilization, new di&s;tempers break forth, and new remedies are applied: but the remedy is not always applied the moment the di&s;temper appears: and laws, though &s;ugge&s;ted by the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, are not the &s;ymptom of a recent corrup|tion, but of a de&s;ire to find a remedy that may cure, perhaps, &s;ome inveterate evil which has long afflicted the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THERE are corruptions, however, under which men &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s the vigour and the re&s;olution to correct them&s;elves. Such are the violence and the outrage which accompany the colli&s;ion of fierce and daring &s;pirits, occupied in the &s;truggles which
<PB N="364" REF="369">
&s;ometimes precede the dawn of civil and commer|cial improvements In &s;uch ca&s;es, men have fre|quently di&s;covered a remedy for evils, of which their own mi&s;guided impetuo&s;ity, and &s;uperior force of mind, were the principal cau&s;es. But if to a depraved di&s;po&s;ition, we &s;uppo&s;e to be joined a weakne&s;s of &s;pirit; if to an admiration, and de|&s;ire of riches, be joined an aver&s;ion to danger or bu&s;ine&s;s; if tho&s;e orders of men who&s;e valour is required by the public, cea&s;e to be brave; if the members of &s;ociety, in general, have not tho&s;e per&s;onal qualities which are required to fill the &s;tations of equality, or of honour, to which they are invited by the forms of the &s;tate; they mu&s;t &s;ink to a depth from which their imbecility, even more than their depraved inclinations, may pre|vent their ri&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of Luxury.</HEAD>
<P>WE are far from being agreed on the appli|cation of the term <HI>luxury,</HI> or on that de|gree of its meaning which is con&s;i&s;tent with na|tional pro&s;perity, or with the moral rectitude of our nature. It is &s;ometimes employed to &s;ignify a manner of life which we think nece&s;&s;ary to ci|vilization, and even to happine&s;s. It is, in our panegyric of poli&s;hed ages, the parent of arts, the &s;upport of commerce, and the mini&s;ter of na|tional greatne&s;s, and of opulence. It is, in our cen&s;ure of degenerate manners, the &s;ource of cor|ruption, and the pre&s;age of national declen&s;ion and ruin. It is admired, and it is blamed; it is treated as ornamental and u&s;eful; and it is pro|&s;cribed as a vice.</P>
<P>WITH all this diver&s;ity in our judgements, we are generally uniform in employing the term to &s;ignify that complicated apparatus which mankind devi&s;e for the ea&s;e and convenience of life. Their buildings, furniture, equipage, cloathing, train of dome&s;tics, refinement of the table, and, in gene|ral, all that a&s;&s;emblage which is rather intended to plea&s;e the fancy, than to obviate real wants, and which is rather ornamental than u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="371">
WHEN we are di&s;po&s;ed, therefore, under the appellation of <HI>luxury,</HI> to rank the enjoyment of of the&s;e things among the vices, we either tacitly refer to the habits of &s;en&s;uality, debauchery, pro|digality, vanity, and arrogance, with which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of high fortune is &s;ometimes attended; or we apprehend a certain mea&s;ure of what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to human life, beyond which all enjoy|ments are &s;uppo&s;ed to be exce&s;&s;ive and vicious. When, on the contrary, luxury is made an arti|cle of national lu&s;tre and felicity, we only think of it as an innocent con&s;equence of the unequal di&s;tribution of wealth, and as a method by which different ranks are rendered mutually dependent, and mutually u&s;eful. The poor are made to prac|ti&s;e arts, and the rich to reward them. The pub|lic it&s;elf is made a gainer by what &s;eems to wa&s;te its &s;tock, and it receives a perpetual increa&s;e of wealth, from the influence of tho&s;e growing appe|tites, and delicate ta&s;tes, which &s;eem to menace con&s;umption and ruin.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that we mu&s;t either, together with the commercial arts, &s;uffer their fruits to be enjoyed, and even, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, admired; or, like the Spartans, prohibit the art it&s;elf, while we are afraid of its con&s;equences, or while we think that the conveniencies it brings exceed what nature requires.</P>
<P>WE may propo&s;e to &s;top the advancement of arts at any &s;tage of their progre&s;s, and &s;till incur the cen&s;ure of luxury from tho&s;e who have not advanced &s;o far. The hou&s;e-builder and the car|penter at Sparta were limited to the u&s;e of the
<PB N="367" REF="372">
axe and the &s;aw; but a Spartan cottage might have pa&s;&s;ed for a palace in Thrace: and if the di&s;|pute were to turn on the knowledge of what is phy&s;ically nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of human life, as the &s;tandard of what is morally lawful, the faculties of phy&s;ic, as well as of morality, would probably divide on the &s;ubject, and leave every individual, as at pre&s;ent, to find &s;ome rule for him&s;elf. The ca&s;ui&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, con|&s;iders the practice of his own age and condition, as a &s;tandard for mankind. If in one age or con|dition, he condemn the u&s;e of a coach, in another he would have no le&s;s cen&s;ured the wearing of &s;hoes; and the very per&s;on who exclaims again&s;t the fir&s;t, would probably not have &s;pared the &s;e|cond, if it had not been already familiar in ages be|fore his own. A cen&s;or born in a cottage, and accu&s;tomed to &s;leep upon &s;traw, does not propo&s;e that men &s;hould return to the woods and the caves for &s;helter; he admits the rea&s;onablene&s;s and the utility of what is already famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r; and apprehends an exce&s;s and corruption, only in the newe&s;t refine|ment of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>THE clergy of Europe have preached &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively again&s;t every new fa&s;hion, and every inno|vation in dre&s;s. The modes of youth are the &s;ubject of cen&s;ure to the old; and modes of the la&s;t age, in their turn, are matter of ridicule to the flippant, and the young. Of this there is not always a better account to be given, than that the old are di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;evere, and the young to be merry.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="373">
THE argument again&s;t many of the conveni|encies of life, drawn from the mere con&s;ideration of their not being nece&s;&s;ary, was equally proper in the mouth of the &s;avage, who di&s;&s;uaded from the fir&s;t applications of indu&s;try, as it is in that of the morali&s;t, who in&s;i&s;ts on the vanity of the la&s;t.
<Q>Our ance&s;tors,</Q> he might &s;ay, <Q>found their dwelling under this rock; they gathered their food in the fore&s;t; they allayed their thir&s;t from the fountain; and they were clothed in the &s;poils of the bea&s;t they had &s;lain. Why &s;hould we indulge a fal&s;e delicacy, or require from the earth fruits which &s;he is not accu&s;tomed to yield? The bow of our fathers is already too &s;trong for our arms; and the wild bea&s;t begins to lord it in the woods.</Q></P>
<P>THUS the morali&s;t may have found, in the proceedings of every age, tho&s;e topics of blame, from which he is &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to arraign the manners of his own; and our embarra&s;&s;ment on the &s;ubject, is, perhaps, but a part of that general perplexity which we undergo, in trying to define moral characters by external circum&s;tances, which may, or may not, be attended with faults in the mind and the heart. One man finds a vice in the wearing of linen; another does not, unle&s;s the fa|bric be fine; and if, mean-time, it be true, that a per&s;on may be dre&s;&s;ed in manufacture, either cour&s;e or fine; that he may &s;leep in the fields, or lodge in a palace; tread upon carpet, or plant his foot on the ground; while the mind either re|tains, or has lo&s;t, its penetration, and its vigour, and the heart its affection to mankind, it is vain, under any &s;uch circum&s;tance, to &s;eek for the di&s;tinctions
<PB N="369" REF="374">
of virtue and vice, or to tax the poli&s;hed citizen with weakne&s;s for any part of his equipage, or for his wearing a &s;ur, perhaps, in which &s;ome &s;a|vage was dre&s;&s;ed before him. Vanity is not di|&s;tingui&s;hed by any peculiar &s;pecies of dre&s;s. It is betrayed by the Indian in the phanta&s;tic a&s;&s;ort|ments of his plumes, his &s;hells, his party-coloured furs, and in the time he be&s;tows at the gla&s;s and the toilet. Its projects in the woods and in the town are the &s;ame: in the one, it &s;eeks, with the vi&s;age bedaubed, and with teeth artificially &s;tained, for that admiration, which it courts in the other with a gilded equipage, and liveries of &s;tate.</P>
<P>POLISHED nations, in their progre&s;s, often come to &s;urpa&s;s the rude in moderation, and &s;e|verity of manners.
<Q>The Greek,</Q> &s;ays Thucy|dides, <Q>not long ago, like barbarians, wore golden &s;pangles in the hair, and went armed in times of peace.</Q>
Simplicity of dre&s;s in this people, became a mark of politene&s;s: and the mere materials with which the body is nouri&s;hed or clothed, are probably of little con&s;equence to any people. We mu&s;t look for the characters of men in the qualities of the mind, not in the &s;pe|cies of their food, or in the mode of their ap|parel. What are now the ornaments of the grave, and &s;evere; what is owned to be a real conveni|ency, were once the &s;opperies of youth, or were devi&s;ed to plea&s;e the effeminate. The new fa&s;hion, indeed, is often the mark of the coxcomb; but we frequently change our fa&s;hions, without increa&s;ing the mea&s;ures of our vanity or folly.</P>

Are we never to dread any error in the article of a refinement be&s;towed on the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or the conveniencies of life? The fact is, that men are perpetually expo&s;ed to the com|mi&s;&s;ion of error in this article, not merely where they are accu&s;tomed to high mea&s;ures of accom|modation, or to any particular &s;pecies of food, but where-ever the&s;e objects, in general, may come to be preferred to friends, to a country, or to mankind; they actually commit &s;uch error, where|ever they admire paultry di&s;tinctions or frivolous advantages; where-ever they &s;hrink from &s;mall in|conveniencies, and are incapable of di&s;charging their duty with vigour. The u&s;e of morality on this &s;ubject, is not to limit men to any particular &s;pecies of lodging, diet, or cloaths; but to pre|vent their con&s;idering the&s;e conveniencies as the principal objects of human life. And if we are a&s;ked, Where the pur&s;uit of trifling accommoda|tions &s;hould &s;top, in order that a man may devote him&s;elf entirely to the higher engagements of life? we may an&s;wer, That it &s;hould &s;top where it is. This was the rule followed at Sparta: The ob|ject of the rule was, to pre&s;erve the heart entire for the public, and to occupy men in cultivating their own nature, not in accumulating wealth, and external conveniencies. It was not expected otherwi&s;e, that the axe or the &s;aw &s;hould be at|tended with greater political advantage, than the plane and the chi&s;el. When Cato walked the &s;treets of Rome without his robe, and without &s;hoes, he did &s;o, mo&s;t probably, in contempt of what his countrymen were &s;o prone to admire; not in hopes of finding a virtue in one &s;pecies of dre&s;s, or a vice in another.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="376">
LUXURY, therefore, con&s;idered as a predilec|tion in favour of the objects of vanity, and the co&s;tly materials of plea&s;ure, is ruinous to the hu|man character; con&s;idered as the mere u&s;e of ac|commodations and conveniencies which the age has procured, rather depends on the progre&s;s which the mechanical arts have made, and on the degree in which the fortunes of men are unequally par|celled, than on the di&s;po&s;itions of particular men either to vice or to virtue.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT mea&s;ures of luxury are, however, variou&s;ly &s;uited to different con&s;titutions of go|vernment. The advancement of arts &s;uppo&s;es an unequal di&s;tribution of fortune; and the means of di&s;tinction they bring, &s;erve to render the &s;epa|ration of ranks more &s;en&s;ible. Luxury is, upon this account, apart from all its moral effects, ad|ver&s;e to the form of democratical government; and in any &s;tate of &s;ociety, can be &s;afely admitted in that degree only in which the members of the community are &s;uppo&s;ed of unequal rank, and con&s;titute public order by means of a regular &s;ub|ordination. High degrees of it appear &s;alutary, and even nece&s;&s;ary, in monarchical and mixed go|vernments; where, be&s;ides the encouragement to arts and commerce, it &s;erves to give lu&s;tre to tho&s;e hereditary or con&s;titutional dignities which have a place of importance in the political &s;y&s;tem. Whether even here luxury leads to abu&s;e peculiar to ages of high refinement and opulence, we &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider in the following &s;ections.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Corruption incident to Poli&s;hed Nations.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY and corruption are frequently coupled together, and even pa&s;s for &s;ynony|mous terms. But in order to avoid any di&s;pute about words, by the fir&s;t we may under&s;tand that accumulation of wealth, and that refinement on the ways of enjoying it, which are the objects of indu&s;try, or the fruits of mechanic and commercial arts: And by the &s;econd a real weakne&s;s, or de|pravity of the human character, which may ac|company any &s;tate of tho&s;e arts, and be found under any external circum&s;tances or condition what&s;oever. It remains to inquire, What are the corruptions incident to poli&s;hed nations, arrived at certain mea&s;ures of luxury, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cer|tain advantages, in which they are generally &s;up|po&s;ed to excel?</P>
<P>WE need not have recour&s;e to a parallel be|tween the manners of entire nations, in the ex|tremes of civilization and rudene&s;s, in order to be &s;atisfied, that the vices of men are not propor|tioned to their fortunes; or that the habits of avarice, or of &s;en&s;uality, are not founded on any certain mea&s;ures of wealth, or determinate kind of enjoyment. Where the &s;ituations of particular men are varied as much by their per&s;onal &s;tations, as they can be by the &s;tate of national refinements, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions for intere&s;t, or plea&s;ure, prevail in every condition. They ari&s;e from temperament,
<PB N="373" REF="378">
or an acquired admiration of property; not from any particular manner of life in which the parties are engaged, nor from any particular &s;pecies of property, which may have occupied their cares and their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>TEMPERANCE and moderation are, at lea&s;t. as frequent among tho&s;e whom we call the &s;uperior, as they are among the lower cla&s;&s;es of men; and however we may affix the character of &s;obriety to mere cheapne&s;s of diet, and other accommoda|tions with which any particular age, or rank of men, appear to be contented, it is well known, that co&s;tly materials are not nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a debauch, nor profligacy le&s;s frequent under the thatched roof, than under the lofty ceiling. Men grow equally familiar with different conditions, re|ceive equal plea&s;ure, and are equally allured to &s;en&s;uality, in the palace, and in the cave. Their acquiring in either habits of intemperance or &s;loth, depends on the remi&s;&s;ion of other pur&s;uits, and on the di&s;ta&s;te of the mind to other engage|ments. If the affections of the heart be awake, and the pa&s;&s;ions of love, admiration, or anger, be kindled, the co&s;tly furniture of the palace, as well as the homely accommodations of the cottage, are neglected: and men, when rou&s;ed, reject their repo&s;e; or, when wearied, embrace it alike on the &s;ilken bed, or on the couch of &s;traw.</P>
<P>WE are not, however, from hence to conclude, that luxury, with all its concomitant circum&s;tances, which either &s;erve to favour its increa&s;e, or which, in the arrangements of civil &s;ociety, follow it as con&s;equences, can have no effect to the di&s;advan|tage of national manners. If that re&s;pite from

public dangers and troubles which gives a lei&s;ure for the practice of commercial arts, be continued, or increa&s;ed, into a di&s;u&s;e of national efforts; if the individual, not called to unite with his coun|try, be left to pur&s;ue his private advantage; we may find him become effeminate, mercenary, and &s;en&s;ual; not becau&s;e plea&s;ures and profits are be|come more alluring, but becau&s;e he has fewer calls to attend to other objects; and becau&s;e he has more encouragement to &s;tudy his per&s;onal ad|vantages, and pur&s;ue his &s;eparate intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;parities of rank and fortune which are nece&s;&s;ary to the pur&s;uit or enjoyment of luxury, introduce fal&s;e grounds of precedency and e&s;ti|mation; if, on the mere con&s;iderations of being rich or poor, one order of men are, in their own apprehen&s;ion, elevated, another deba&s;ed; if one be criminally proud, another meanly dejected; and every rank in its place, like the tyrant, who thinks that nations are made for him&s;elf, be di&s;|po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ume on the rights of mankind: al|though, upon the compari&s;on, the higher order may be lea&s;t corrupted; or from education, and a &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal dignity, have mo&s;t good quali|tles remaining; yet the one becoming mercenary and &s;ervile; the other imperious and arrogant; both regardle&s;s of ju&s;tice, and of merit; the whole ma&s;s is corrupted, and the manners of a &s;ociety changed for the wor&s;e, in proportion as its mem|bers cea&s;e to act on principles of equality, inde|pendence, or freedom.</P>
<P>UPON this view, and con&s;idering the merits of men in the ab&s;tract, a mere change from the habits of a republic to tho&s;e of a monarchy;
<PB N="375" REF="382">
from the love of equality, to the &s;en&s;e of a &s;ub|ordination founded on birth, titles, and fortune, is a &s;pecies of corruption to mankind. But this degree of corruption is &s;till con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of &s;ome nations; it admits of a vigorous courage, by which the rights of in|dividuals, and of kingdoms, may be long pre|&s;erved.</P>
<P>UNDER the form of monarchy, while yet in its vigour, &s;uperior fortune is, indeed, one mark by which the different orders of men are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; but there are &s;ome other ingredients, without which wealth is not admitted as a foun|dation of precedency, and in favour of which it is often de&s;pi&s;ed, and lavi&s;hed away. Such are birth and titles, the reputation of courage, courtly manners, and a certain elevation of mind. If we &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e di&s;tinctions are forgotten, and nobility it&s;elf only to be known by the &s;umptuous retinue which money alone may procure; and by a lavi&s;h expence, which the more recent fortunes can generally be&s;t &s;u&s;tain; luxury mu&s;t then be allowed to corrupt the monarchical as much as the republican &s;tate, and to introduce a fatal di&s;|&s;olution of manners, under which men of every condition, although they are eager to acquire, or to di&s;play their wealth, have no remains of real ambition. They have neither the elevation of no|bles, nor the fidelity of &s;ubjects; they have chan|ged into effeminate vanity, that &s;en&s;e of honour which gave rules to the per&s;onal courage; and into a &s;ervile ba&s;ene&s;s, that loyalty, which bound each in his place, to his immediate &s;uperior, and the whole to the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="383">
NATIONS are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to corruption from this quarter, when the mechanical arts, being greatly advanced, furni&s;h numberle&s;s articles, to be applied in ornament to the per&s;on, in furni|ture, entertainment, or equipage; when &s;uch ar|ticles as the rich alone can procure are admired; and when con&s;ideration, precedence, and rank, are accordingly made to depend on fortune.</P>
<P>IN a more rude &s;tate of the arts, although wealth be unequally divided, the opulent can ama&s;s only the &s;imple means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: They can only fill the granary, and furni&s;h the &s;tall; reap from more extended fields, and drive their herds over a larger pa&s;ture. To enjoy their mag|nificence they mu&s;t live in a croud; and to &s;ecure their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t be surrounded with friends that e&s;pou&s;e their quarrels. Their honours, as well as their &s;afety, con&s;i&s;t in the numbers who attend them; and their per&s;onal di&s;tinctions are taken from their liberality, and &s;uppo&s;ed elevation of mind. In this manner, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of riches &s;erves only to make the owner a&s;&s;ume a character of magnanimity, to become the guardian of num|bers, rr the public object of re&s;pect and affection. But when the bulky con&s;tituents of wealth, and of ru&s;tic magnificence, can be exchanged for refine|ments; and when the produce of the &s;oil may be turned into equipage, and mere decoration; when the combination of many is no longer required for per&s;onal &s;afety; the ma&s;ter may become the &s;ole con&s;umer of his own e&s;tate: he may refer the u&s;e of every &s;ubject to him&s;elf; he may employ the materials of genero&s;ity to feed a per&s;onal va|nity, or to indulge a &s;ickly and effeminate fancy,

<P>THE Per&s;ian &s;atrape, we are told, when he &s;aw the King of Sparta at the place of their con|ference, &s;tretched on the gra&s;s with his &s;oldiers, blu&s;hed at the provi&s;ion he had made for the ac|commodation of his own per&s;on: he ordered the furs and the carpets to be withdrawn; he felt his own inferiority; and recollected, that he was to treat with a man, not to vie with a pageant in co&s;tly attire and magnificence.</P>
<P>WHEN, amid&s;t circum&s;tances that make no trial of the virtues or talents of men, we have been accu&s;tomed to the air of &s;uperiority, which people of fortune derive from their retinue, we are apt to lo&s;e every &s;en&s;e of di&s;tinction ari&s;ing from merit, or even from abilities. We rate our fellow-citizens by the <HI>figure</HI> they are able to make; by their buildings, their dre&s;s, their equipage, and the train of their followers. All the&s;e circum|&s;tances make a part in our e&s;timate of what is ex|cellent; and if the ma&s;ter him&s;elf is known to be a pageant in the mid&s;t of his fortune, we never|thele&s;s pay our court to his &s;tation, and look up with an envious, &s;ervile, or dejected mind, to what is, in it&s;elf, &s;carcely fit to amu&s;e children; though, when it is worn as a badge of di&s;tinction, it in|flames the ambition of tho&s;e we call the great, and &s;trikes the multitude with awe and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WE judge of entire nations by the productions of a few mechanical arts, and think we are talk|ing of men, while we are boa&s;ting of their e&s;tates, their dre&s;s, and their palaces. The &s;en&s;e in which
<PB N="378" REF="385">
we apply the terms, <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>noble, high rank,</HI> and <HI>high life,</HI> &s;hew, that we have, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, transferred the idea of perfection from the character to the equipage; and that excellence it&s;elf is, in our e&s;teem, a mere pageant, adorned at a great expence, by the labours of many work|men.</P>
<P>TO tho&s;e who overlook the &s;ubtile tran&s;itions of the imagination, it might appear, &s;ince wealth can do no more than furni&s;h the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and purcha&s;e animal plea&s;ures, that co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, and venality it&s;elf, &s;hould keep pace with our fears of want, or with our appetite for &s;en&s;ual enjoyments; and that where the appetite is &s;atiated, and the fear of want is removed, the mind &s;hould be at ea&s;e on the &s;ubject of fortune. But they are not the mere plea&s;ures that riches procure, nor the choice of viands which cover the board of the wealthy, that inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the covetous and the mercenary. Nature is ea&s;ily &s;atisfied in all her enjoyments. It is an opinion of eminence, connected with fortune; it is a &s;en&s;e of deba&s;ement attending on poverty, which renders us blind to every advantage, but that of the rich; and in&s;en&s;ible to every di&s;grace, but that of the poor. It is this unhappy apprehen&s;ion, that occa&s;ionally prepares us for the de&s;ertion of every duty, for a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every indignity, and for the commi&s;&s;ion of every crime that can be accompli&s;hed in &s;afety.</P>

on the throne of Indo&s;tan. Simple, ab&s;tinent, and &s;evere in his diet, and other plea&s;ures, he &s;till led the life of a hermit, and occupied his time with a &s;eemingly painful application to the affairs of a great empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gemelli Carceri.</NOTE>. He quitted a &s;tation in which, if plea&s;ure had been his object, he might have indulged his &s;en&s;uality without re&s;erve; he made his way to a &s;cene of di&s;quietude and care; he aimed at the &s;ummit of human greatne&s;s, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of imperial fortune, not at the gra|tifications of animal appetite, or the enjoyment of ea&s;e. Superior to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, as well as to the feelings of nature, he dethroned his father, and he murdered his brothers, that he might roll on a carriage incru&s;ted with diamond and pearl; that his elephants, his camels, and his hor&s;es, on the march, might form a line extending many leagues; might pre&s;ent a glittering harne&s;s to the &s;un; and loaded with trea&s;ure, u&s;her to the view of an abject and admiring croud, that awful ma|je&s;ty, in who&s;e pre&s;ence they were to &s;trike the forehead on the ground, and be overwhelmed with the &s;en&s;e of his greatne&s;s, and with that of their own deba&s;ement.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e are the objects which prompt the de|&s;ire of dominion, and excite the ambitious to aim at the ma&s;tery of their fellow-creatures; &s;o they in&s;pire the ordinary race of men with a &s;en&s;e of infirmity and meanne&s;s, that prepares them to &s;uffer indignities, and to become the property of per&s;ons, whom they con&s;ider as of a rank and a nature &s;o much &s;uperior to their own.</P>

THE chains of perpetual &s;lavery, accordingly, appear to be rivetted in the Ea&s;t, no le&s;s by the pageantry which is made to accompany the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of power, than they are by the fears of the &s;word, and the terrors of a military execution. In the We&s;t, as well as the Ea&s;t, we are willing to bow to the &s;plendid equipage, and &s;tand at an awful di&s;tance from the pomp of a princely e&s;tate. We too, may be terrified by the frowns, or won by the &s;miles, of tho&s;e who&s;e favour is riches and honour, and who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure is poverty and neg|lect. We too may overlook the honours of the human &s;oul, from an admiration of the pagean|tries that accompany fortune. The proce&s;&s;ion of elephants harne&s;&s;ed with gold might dazzle into &s;laves, the people who derive corruption and weakne&s;s from the effect of their own arts and contrivances, as well as tho&s;e who inherit &s;ervi|lity from their ance&s;tors, and are enfeebled by their natural temperament, and the enervating charms of their &s;oil, and their climate.</P>
<P>IT appears, therefore, that although the mere u&s;e of mateeials which con&s;titute luxury, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from actual vice; yet nations under a high &s;tate of the commercial arts, are expo&s;ed to corruption, by their admitting wealth, un&s;up|ported by per&s;onal elevation and virtue, as the great foundation of di&s;tinction, and by having their attention turned on the &s;ide of intere&s;t, as the road to con&s;ideration and honour.</P>
<P>WITH this effect, luxury may &s;erve to cor|rupt democratical &s;tates, by introducing a &s;pecies

of monarchical &s;ubordination, without that &s;en&s;e of high birth and hereditary honours which render the boundaries of rank fixed and determinate, and which teach men to act in their &s;tations with force and propriety. It may prove the occa&s;ion of political corruption, even in monarchical go|vernments, by drawing re&s;pect towards mere wealth; by ca&s;ting a &s;hade on the lu&s;tre of per&s;onal qualities, or family-di&s;tinctions; and by infecting all orders of men, with equal venality, &s;ervility, and cowardice.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;ame &s;ubject continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE increa&s;ing regard with which men ap|pear, in the progre&s;s of commercial arts, to &s;tudy their profit, or the delicacy with which they refine on their plea&s;ures; even indu&s;try it&s;elf, or the habit of application to a tedious employment, in which no honours are won, may, perhaps, be con&s;idered as indications of a growing attention to intere&s;t, or of effeminacy, contracted in the en|joyment of ea&s;e and conveniency. Every &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive art, by which the individual is taught to im|prove on his fortune, is, in reality, an addition to his private engagements, and a new avocation of his mind from the public.</P>
<P>CORRUPTION, however, does not ari&s;e from the abu&s;e of commercial arts alone; it requires the aid of political &s;ituation; and is not pro|duced by the objects that occupy a &s;ordid and a mercenary &s;pirit, without the aid of circum&s;tances that enable men to indulge in &s;afety any mean di&s;po&s;ition they have acquired.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE has fitted mankind for the high|er engagements which they are &s;ometimes obliged to fulfil; and it is in the mid&s;t of &s;uch engage|ments that they are mo&s;t likely to acquire or to pre&s;erve their virtues. The habits of a vigorous
<PB N="383" REF="390">
mind are formed in contending with difficulties, not in enjoying the repo&s;e of a pacific &s;tation; penetration and wi&s;dom are the fruits of experi|ence, not the le&s;&s;ons of retirement and lei&s;ure; ardour and genero&s;ity are the qualities of a mind rou&s;ed and animated in the conduct of &s;cenes that engage the heart, not the gifts of reflection or knowledge. The mere intermi&s;&s;ion of national and political efforts is, notwith&s;tanding, &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for public good; and there is no mi&s;take more likely to fo&s;ter the vices, or to flatter the weakne&s;s, of feeble and intere&s;ted men.</P>
<P>IF the ordinary arts of policy, or rather, if a growing indifference to objects of a public nature, &s;hould prevail, and, under any free con&s;titution, put an end to tho&s;e di&s;putes of party, and &s;ilence that noi&s;e of di&s;&s;en&s;ion, which generally accompa|ny the exerci&s;e of freedom, we may venture to progno&s;ticate corruption to the national manners, as well as remi&s;&s;ne&s;s to the national &s;pirit. The period is come, when, no engagement remaining on the part of the public, private intere&s;t, and animal plea&s;ure, become the &s;overeign objects of care. When men, being relieved from the pre&s;&s;ure of great occa&s;ions, be&s;tow their attention on trifles; and having carried what they are plea&s;ed to call <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>delicacy,</HI> on the &s;ubject of ea&s;e or mole&s;tation, as far as real weakne&s;s or folly can go, have recour&s;e to affectation, in order to en|hance the pretended demands, and accumulate the anxieties, of a &s;ickly fancy, and enfeebled mind.</P>
<P>IN this condition, mankind generally flatter their own imbecility under the name of <HI>politene&s;s.</HI> They are per&s;uaded, that the celebrated ardour,
<PB N="384" REF="391">
genero&s;ity, and fortitude, of former ages, border|ed on frenzy, or were the mere effects of nece&s;|&s;ity, on men who had not the means of enjoying their ea&s;e, or their plea&s;ure. They congratulate them&s;elves on having e&s;caped the &s;torm which re|quired the exerci&s;e of &s;uch arduous virtues; and with that vanity which accompanies the human race in their meane&s;t condition, they boa&s;t of a &s;cene of affectation, of languor, or of folly, as the &s;tandard of human felicity, and as furni&s;hing the propere&s;t exerci&s;e of a rational nature.</P>
<P>IT is none of the lea&s;t menacing &s;ymptoms of an age prone to degeneracy, that the minds of men become perplexed in the di&s;cernment of me|rit, as much as the &s;pirit becomes enfeebled in conduct, and the heart mi&s;led in the choice of its objects. The care of mere fortune is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute wi&s;dom; retirement from public af|fairs, and real indifference to mankind, receive the applau&s;es of moderation and virtue.</P>
<P>GREAT fortitude, and elevation of mind, have not always, indeed, been employed in the attain|ment of valuable ends; but they are always re|&s;pectable, and they are always nece&s;&s;ary when we would act for the good of mankind, in any of the more arduous &s;tations of life. While, therefore we blame their mi&s;application, we &s;hould beware of depreciating their value. Men of a &s;evere and &s;ententious morality have not always &s;ufficiently ob&s;erved this caution; nor have they been duly aware of the corruptions they flattered, by the &s;atire they employed again&s;t what is a&s;piring and prominent in the character of the human &s;oul.</P>

<P>IF men mu&s;t go wrong, there is a choice of their very errors, as well as of their virtues. Am|bition, the love of per&s;onal eminence, and the de|&s;ire of fame, although they &s;ometimes lead to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, yet always engage men in
<PB N="386" REF="393">
pur&s;uits that require to be &s;upported by &s;ome of the greate&s;t qualities of the human &s;oul; and if eminence is the principal object of pur&s;uit, there is, at lea&s;t, a probability, that tho&s;e qualities may be &s;tudied on which a real elevation of mind is rai&s;ed. But when public alarms have cea&s;ed, and contempt of glory is recommended as an article of wi&s;dom, the &s;ordid habits, and mercenary di&s;|po&s;itions, to which, under a general indifference to national objects, the members of a poli&s;hed or com|merical &s;tate are expo&s;ed, mu&s;t prove at once the mo&s;t effectual &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of every liberal &s;entiment, and the mo&s;t fatal rever&s;e of all tho&s;e principles from which communities derive their hopes of pre&s;erva|tion, and their &s;trength.</P>
<P>IT is noble to po&s;&s;e&s;s happine&s;s and independence, either in retirement, or in public life. The Cha|racteri&s;tic of the happy, is to acquit them&s;elves well in every condition; in the court, or in the vil|lage; in the &s;enate, or in the private retreat. But if they affect any particular &s;tation, it is &s;urely that in which their actions may be rendered mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ively u&s;eful. Our con&s;idering mere retirement, therefore, as a &s;ymptom of moderation, and of virtue, is either a remnant of that &s;y&s;tem, under which monks and anchorets, in former ages, have been canonized; or proceeds from a habit of think|ing, which appears equally fraught with moral cor|ruption, from our con&s;idering public life as a &s;cene for the gratification of mere vanity, avarice, and ambition; never as furni&s;hing the be&s;t opportuni|ty for a ju&s;t and a happy engagement of the mind and the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="394">
EMULATION, and the de&s;ire of power, are but &s;orry motives to public conduct; but if they have been, in any ca&s;e, the principal inducements from which men have taken part in the &s;ervice of their country, any diminution of their prevalence or force is a real corruption of national manners; and the pretended moderation a&s;&s;umed by the higher orders of men, has a fatal effect in the &s;tate. The di&s;intere&s;ted love of the public, is a principle with|out which &s;ome con&s;titutions of government can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t: but when we con&s;ider how &s;eldom this has appeared a reigning pa&s;&s;ion, we have little rea&s;on to impute the pro&s;perity or pre&s;erva|tion of nations, in every ca&s;e, to its influence.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficient, perhaps, under one form of government, that men &s;hould be fond of their in|dependence; that they &s;hould be ready to oppo&s;e u&s;urpation, and to repel per&s;onal indignities: un|der another, it is &s;ufficient that they &s;hould be te|nacious of their rank, and of their honours; and in&s;tead of a zeal for the public, entertain a vigilant jealou&s;y of the rights which pertain to them&s;elves. When numbers of men retain a cer|tain degree of elevation and fortitude, they are qualified to give a mutual check to their &s;everal errors, and are able to act in that variety of &s;itu|ations which the different con&s;titutions of govern|ment have prepared for their members: but, un|der the di&s;advantages of a feeble &s;pirit, however directed, and however informed, no national con|&s;titution is &s;afe; nor can any degree of enlarge|ment to which a &s;tate has arrived, &s;ecure its po|litical welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="395">
IN &s;tates where property, di&s;tinction, and plea|&s;ure, are thrown out as baits to the imagination, and incentives to pa&s;&s;ion, the public &s;eems to re|ly for the pre&s;ervation of its political life, on the degree of emulation and jealou&s;y with which par|ties mutually oppo&s;e and re&s;train each other. The de&s;ires of preferment and profit in the brea&s;t of the citizen, are the motives from which he is ex|cited to enter on public affairs, and are the con|&s;iderations which direct his political conduct. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, therefore, of ambition, of party-ani|mo&s;ity, and of public envy, is probably, in every &s;uch ca&s;e, not a reformation, but a &s;ymptom of weakne&s;s, and a prelude to more &s;ordid pur&s;uits, and ruinous amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>ON the eve of &s;uch a revolution in manners, the higher ranks, in every mixed or monarchical government, have need to take care of them&s;elves. Men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of indu&s;try, in the inferior &s;tations of life, retain their occupations, and are &s;ecured, by a kind of nece&s;&s;ity, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e habits on which they rely for their quiet, and for the moderate enjoyments of life. But the higher orders of men, if they relinqui&s;h the &s;tate, if they cea&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s that courage and elevation of mind, and to exerci&s;e tho&s;e talents which are employed in its defence, and its government, are, in reality, by the &s;eeming advantages of their &s;ta|tion, become the refu&s;e of that &s;ociety of which they once were the ornament; and from being the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, and the mo&s;t happy, of its mem|bers, are become the mo&s;t wretched and corrupt. In their approach to this condition, and in the ab&s;ence of every manly occupation, they feel a
<PB N="389" REF="396">
di&s;&s;atisfaction and languor which they cannot ex|plain: They pine in the mid&s;t of apparent enjoy|ments; or, by the variety and caprice of their dif|ferent pur&s;uits and amu&s;ements, exhibit a &s;tate of agitation, which, like the di&s;quiet of &s;ickne&s;s, is not a proof of enjoyment or plea&s;ure, but of &s;uf|fering and pain. The care of his buildings, his equipage, or his table, is cho&s;en by one; literary amu&s;ement, or &s;ome frivolous &s;tudy, by another. The &s;ports of the country, and the diver&s;ions of the town; the gaming-table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e different occupations differ from each other, in re|&s;pect to their dignity, and their innocence; but none of them are the &s;chools from which men are brought to &s;u&s;tain the tot|tering fortune of nations; they are equally avocations from what ought to be the principal pur&s;uit of man, the good of mankind.</NOTE>, dogs, hor&s;es, and wine, are employed to fill up the blank of a li&s;tle&s;s and unprofitable life. They &s;peak of human pur|&s;uits, as if the whole difficulty were to find &s;ome|thing to do: They fix on &s;ome frivolous occupati|on, as if there was nothing that de&s;erved to be done: They con&s;ider what tends to the good of their fellow-creatures, as a di&s;advantage to them|&s;elves: They fly from every &s;cene, in which any efforts of vigour are required, or in which they might be allured to perform any &s;ervice to their country. We mi&s;apply our compa&s;&s;ion in pitying the poor; it were much more ju&s;tly applied to the rich, who become the fir&s;t victims of that wretch|ed in&s;ignificance, into which the members of every corrupted &s;tate, by the tendency of their weak|ne&s;&s;es, and their vices, are in ha&s;te to plunge them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is in this condition, that the &s;en&s;ual invent all tho&s;e refinements on plea&s;ure, and devi&s;e tho&s;e
<PB N="390" REF="397">
incentives to a &s;atiated appetite, which tend to fo&s;|ter the corruptions of a di&s;&s;olute age. The effects of brutal appetite, and the mere debauch, are more flagrant, and more violent, perhaps, in rude ages, than they are in the later periods of commerce and luxury: but that perpetual habit of &s;earching for animal plea&s;ure where it is not to be found, in the gratifications of an appetite that is cloyed, and among the ruins of an animal con&s;titution, is not more fatal to the virtues of the &s;oul, than it is even to the enjoyment of &s;loth, or of plea&s;ure; it is not a more certain avocation from public af|fairs, or a &s;urer prelude to national decay, than it is a di&s;appointment to our hopes of private felicity.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e reflections, it has been the object, not to a&s;certain a preci&s;e mea&s;ure to which corrupti|on has ri&s;en in any of the nations that have at|tained to eminence, or that have gone to decay; but to de&s;cribe that remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;pirit, that weak|ne&s;s of &s;oul, that &s;tate of national debility, which is likely to end in political &s;lavery; an evil which remains to be con&s;idered as the la&s;t object of cau|tion, and beyond which there is no &s;ubject of di&s;|qui&s;ition in the peri&s;hing fortunes of nations.</P>

<HEAD>Of Corruption, as it tends to Political Slavery.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY, in one &s;en&s;e, appears to be the por|tion of poli&s;hed nations alone. The &s;avage is per&s;onally free, becau&s;e he lives unre&s;trained, and acts with the members of his tribe on terms of equality, The barbarian is frequently inde|pendent from a continuance of the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, or becau&s;e he has courage and a &s;word. But good policy alone can provide for the regu|lar admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, or con&s;titute a force in the &s;tate, which is ready on every occa&s;ion to defend the rights of its members.</P>
<P>IT has been found, that, except in a few &s;ingu|lar ca&s;es, the commercial and political arts have advanced together. The&s;e arts have been in mo|dern Europe &s;o interwoven, that we cannot deter|mine which were prior in the order of time, or derived mo&s;t advantage from the mutual influen|ces with which they act and re-act upon one an|other. It has been ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome nations the &s;pirit of commerce, intent on &s;ecuring its pro|fits, has led the way to political wi&s;dom. A peo|ple, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth, and become jealous of their properties, have formed the project of eman|cipation, and have proceeded, under favour of an importance recently gained, &s;till farther to enlarge their preten&s;ions, and to di&s;pute the prerogatives which their &s;overeign had been in u&s;e to employ. But it is in vain that we expect in one age, from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, the fruit which it is &s;aid to have borne in a former. Great acce&s;&s;ions of fortune, when recent, when accompanied with fru|gality,
<PB N="392" REF="399">
and a &s;en&s;e of independence, may render the owner confident in his &s;trength, and ready to &s;purn at oppre&s;&s;ion. The pur&s;e which is open, not to per&s;onal expence, or to the indulgence of vanity, but to &s;upport the intere&s;ts of a faction, to gratify the higher pa&s;&s;ions of party, render the wealthy citizen formidable to tho&s;e who pretend to dominion; but it does not follow, that in a time of corruption, equal, or greater, mea&s;ures of wealth &s;hould operate to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, when wealth is accumulated only in the hands of the mi&s;er, and runs to wa&s;te from tho&s;e of the prodigal; when heirs of family find them&s;elves &s;traitened and poor, in the mid&s;t of affluence; when the cravings of luxury &s;ilence even the voice of party and faction; when the hopes of meriting the rewards of compliance, or the fear of lo&s;ing what is held at di&s;cretion, keep men in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and anxiety; when for|tune, in &s;hort, in&s;tead of being con&s;idered as the in&s;trument of a vigorous &s;pirit, becomes the idol of a covetous or a profu&s;e, of a rapacious or a ti|morous mind; the foundation on which freedom was built, may &s;erve to &s;upport a tyranny; and what, in one age, rai&s;ed the preten&s;ions, and fo&s;|tered the confidence of the &s;ubject, may, in an|other, incline him to &s;ervility, and furni&s;h the price to be paid for his pro&s;titutions. Even tho&s;e, who, in a vigorous age, gave the example of wealth, in the hands of the people, becoming an occa&s;ion of freedom, may, in times of degeneracy, verify like|wi&s;e the maxim of Tacitus, That the admiration of riches leads to de&s;potical government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>E&s;t apud illos et opibus honos; eoque unus imperitat, <HI>&amp;c</HI> <BIBL>Tacitus de mor.

MEN who have ta&s;ted of freedom, and who have felt their per&s;onal rights, are not ea&s;ily taught to bear with incroachments on either, and cannot, without &s;ome preparation, come to &s;ubmit to op|pre&s;&s;ion. They may receive this unhappy prepara|tion, under different forms of government, from different hands, and arrive at the &s;ame end by dif|ferent ways&punc; They follow one direction in repub|lics, another in monarchies, and in mixed govern|ments. But where-ever the &s;tate has, by means that do not pre&s;erve the virtue of the &s;ubject, effec|tually guarded his &s;afety; remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and neglect of the public, are likely to follow; and poli&s;hed nations of every de&s;cription, appear to encounter a danger, on this quarter, proportioned to the de|gree in which they have, during any continuance, enjoyed the uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of peace and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>LIBERTY re&s;ults, we &s;ay, from the government of laws; and we are apt to con&s;ider &s;tatutes, not merely as the re&s;olutions and maxims of a people de|termined to be free, not as the writings by which their rights are kept on record,; but as a power erected to guard them, and as a barrier which the caprice of man cannot tran&s;gre&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN a Ba&s;ha, in A&s;ia, pretends to decide every controver&s;y by the rules of natural equity, we allow that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of di&s;cretionary powers. When a judge in Europe is left to decide, according to his own interpretation of written laws, is he in any &s;en&s;e more re&s;trained than the former? Have the multiplied words of a &s;tatute an influence over the con&s;cience, and the heart, more power|ful than that of rea&s;on and nature? Does the par|ty, in any judicial proceeding, enjoy a le&s;s degree
<PB N="394" REF="401">
of &s;afety, when his rights are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, on the foundation of a rule that is open to the under|&s;tandings of mankind, than when they are referred to an intricate &s;y&s;tem, which it has become the ob|ject of a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion to &s;tudy and to explain?</P>
<P>IF forms of proceeding, written &s;tatutes, or other con&s;tituents of law, cea&s;e to be enforced by the very &s;pirit from which they aro&s;e; they &s;erve only to cover, not to re&s;train, the iniquities of power: they are po&s;&s;ibly re&s;pected even by the corrupt magi&s;trate, when they favour his purpo&s;e; but they are contemned or evaded, when they &s;tand in his way: And the influence of laws, where they have any real effect in the pre&s;ervation of li|berty, is not any magic power de&s;cending from &s;helves that are loaded with books, but is, in rea|lity, the influence of men re&s;olved to be free; of men, who, having adju&s;ted in writing the terms on which they are to live with the &s;tate, and with their fellow-&s;ubjects, are determined, by their vi|gilance and &s;pirit, to make the&s;e terms be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>WE are taught, under every form of govern|ment, to apprehend u&s;urpations, from the abu&s;e, or from the exten&s;ion of the executive power. In pure monarchies, this power is commonly heredi|tary, and made to de&s;cend in a determinate line. In elective monarchies, it is held for life. In re|publics, it is exerci&s;ed during a limited time. Where men, or families, are called by election to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of temporary dignities, it is more the object of ambition to perpetuate, than to ex|tend their powers. In hereditary monarchies, the &s;overeignty is already perpetual; and the aim of every ambitious prince, is to enlarge his preroga|tive. Rebublics, and, in times of commotion, com|munities
<PB N="395" REF="402">
of every form, are expo&s;ed to hazard, not from tho&s;e only who are formally rai&s;ed to places of tru&s;t, but from every per&s;on whatever, who is incited by ambition, and who is &s;upported by faction.</P>
<P>IT is no advantage to a prince, or other ma|gi&s;trate, to enjoy more power than is con&s;i&s;tent with the good of mankind; nor is it of any be|nefit to a man to be unju&s;t: but the&s;e maxims are a feeble &s;ecurity again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions and follies of men. Tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with any mea&s;ures of influence, are di&s;po&s;ed, from a mere aver&s;ion to con&s;traint, to remove oppo&s;ition. Not only the monarch who wears a hereditary crown, but the magi&s;trate who holds his office for a limited time, grows fond of his dignity. The very mini&s;ter, who depends for his place on the momentary will of his prince, and who&s;e per&s;onal intere&s;ts are, in every re&s;pect, tho&s;e of a &s;ubject, &s;till has the weakne&s;s to take an intere&s;t in the growth of prerogative, and to reckon as gain to him&s;elf the incroachments he has made on the rights of a peo|ple, with whom he him&s;elf and his family are &s;oon to be numbered.</P>
<P>EVEN with the be&s;t intentions towards man|kind, we are inclined to think, that their welfare de|pends, not on the felicity of their own inclinations, or the happy employment of their own talents, but on their ready compliance with what we have devi&s;ed for their good. Accordingly, the greate&s;t virtue of which any &s;overeign has hitherto &s;hown an example, is not a de&s;ire of cheri&s;hing in his people the &s;pirit of freedom and independence; but what is in it&s;elf-&s;ufficiently rare, and highly meritorious, a &s;teady regard to the di&s;tribution of
<PB N="396" REF="403">
ju&s;tice in matters of property, a di&s;po&s;ition to pro|tect and to oblige, to redre&s;s the grievances, and to promote the intere&s;t of his &s;ubjects. It was from a reference to the&s;e objects, that Titus com|puted the value of his time, and judged of its ap|plication. But the &s;word, which in this beneficent hand was drawn to protect the &s;ubject, and to procure a &s;peedy and effectual di&s;tribution of ju&s;|tice, was likewi&s;e &s;ufficient in the hands of a ty|rant, to &s;hed the blood of the innocent, and to cancel the rights of men. The temporary pro|ceedings of humanity, though they &s;u&s;pended the exerci&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, did not break the national chains: the prince was even the better enabled to procure that &s;pecies of good which he &s;tudied; becau&s;e there was no freedom remaining, and be|cau&s;e there was no where a force to di&s;pute his de|crees, or to interrupt their execution.</P>
<P>WAS it in vain, that Antoninus became ac|quainted with the characters of Thra&s;ea, Helvi|dius, Cato, Dion, and Brutus? Was it in vain, that he learned to under&s;tand the form of a free community, rai&s;ed on the ba&s;is of equality and ju&s;tice; or of a monarchy, under which the liber|ties of the &s;ubject were held the mo&s;t &s;acred ob|ject of admini&s;tration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Antoninus, lib. 1.</NOTE>? Did he mi&s;take the means of procuring to mankind what he points out as a ble&s;&s;ing? Or did the ab&s;olute power with which he was furni&s;hed, in a mighty empire, only di&s;able him from executing what his mind had perceived as a national good? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it were vain to flatter the monarch or his people. The fir&s;t cannot be&s;tow liberty, without rai&s;ing a &s;pirit, which may, on occa&s;ion, &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to his
<PB N="397" REF="404">
own de&s;igns; nor the latter receive this ble&s;&s;ing, while they own that it is in the right of a ma&s;ter to give or to with-hold it. The claim of ju&s;tice is firm and peremptory. We receive favours with a &s;en&s;e of obligation and kindne&s;s; but we would inforce our rights, and the &s;pirit of freedom in this exertion cannot take the tone of &s;upplication, or of thankfulne&s;s, without betraying it&s;elf.
<Q>You have intreated Octavius,</Q> &s;ays Brutus to Cicero, <Q>that he would &s;pare tho&s;e who &s;tand foremo&s;t among the citizens of Rome. What if he will not? Mu&s;t we peri&s;h? Yes; rather than owe our &s;afety to him.</Q></P>
<P>LIBERTY is a right which every individual mu&s;t be ready to vindicate for him&s;elf, and which he who pretends to be&s;tow as a favour, has by that very act in reality denied. Even political e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, though they appear to be independent of the will and arbitration of men, cannot be re|lied on for the pre&s;ervation of freedom; they may nouri&s;h, but &s;hould not &s;uper&s;ede that firm and re|&s;olute &s;pirit, with which the liberal mind is always prepared to re&s;i&s;t indignities, and to refer its &s;afety to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WERE a nation, therefore, given to be mould|ed by a &s;overeign, as the clay is put into the hands of the potter, this project of be&s;towing li|berty on a people who are actually &s;ervile, is, per|paps, of all others, the mo&s;t difficult, and re|quires mo&s;t to be executed in &s;ilence, and with the deepe&s;t re&s;erve. Men are qualified to receive this ble&s;&s;ing, only in proportion as they are made to apprehend their own rights; and are made to re|&s;pect the ju&s;t preten&s;ions of mankind; in propor|tion as they are willing to &s;u&s;tain, in their own
<PB N="398" REF="405">
per&s;ons, the burden of government, and of national defence; and are willing to prefer the engagements of a liberal mind, to the enjoyments of &s;loth, or the delu&s;ive hopes of a &s;afety purcha&s;ed by &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and fear.</P>
<P>I SPEAK with re&s;pect, and, if I may be allow|ed the expre&s;&s;ion, even with indulgence, to tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with high prerogatives in the political &s;y&s;tem of nations. It is, indeed, &s;eldom their fault that &s;tates are in&s;laved. What &s;hould be expected from them, but that being actuated by human de&s;ires, they &s;hould be aver&s;e to di&s;ap|pointment, or even to delay; and in the ardour with which they pur&s;ue their object, that they &s;hould break through the barriers that would &s;top their career? If millions recede before &s;ingle men, and &s;enates are pa&s;&s;ive, as if compo&s;ed of mem|bers who had no opinion or &s;en&s;e of their own; on who&s;e &s;ide have the defences of freedom given way, or to whom &s;hall we impute their fall? to the &s;ubject, who has de&s;erted his &s;tation; or to the &s;overeign, who has only remained in his own; and who, if the collateral or &s;ubordinate members of government &s;hall cea&s;e to que&s;tion his power, mu&s;t continue to govern without any re&s;traint?</P>
<P>IT is well known, that con&s;titutions framed for the pre&s;ervation of liberty, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of many parts; and that &s;enates, popular a&s;&s;emblies, courts of ju&s;tice, magi&s;trates of different orders, mu&s;t com|bine to balance each other, while they exerci&s;e, &s;u&s;|tain, or check the executive power. If any part is &s;truck out, the fabric mu&s;t totter, or fall; if any member is remi&s;s, the others mu&s;t incroach. In a&s;|&s;emblies con&s;tituted by men of different talents, habits, and apprehen&s;ions, it were &s;omething more
<PB N="399" REF="406">
than human that could make them agree in every point of importance; having different opinions and views, it were want of integrity to ab&s;tain from di&s;putes: our very prai&s;e of unanimity, therefore, is to be con&s;idered as a danger to liberty. We wi&s;h for it, at the hazard of taking in its place, the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of men grown indifferent to the public; the venality of tho&s;e who have &s;old the rights of their country; or the &s;ervility of others, who give implicit obedience to a leader by whom their minds are &s;ubdued. The love of the pub|lic, and re&s;pect to its laws, are the points in which mankind are bound to agree; but if, in matters of controver&s;y, the &s;en&s;e of any individual or party is invariably pur&s;ued, the cau&s;e of freedom is al|ready betrayed.</P>
<P>HE who&s;e office it is to govern a &s;upine or an abject people, cannot, for a moment, cea&s;e to ex|tend his powers.

<P>WHAT the prince, under a pure or limited monarchy, is, by the con&s;titution of his country, the leader of a faction would willingly become in republican governments. If he attains to this envied condition, his own inclination, or the ten|dency of human affairs, &s;eem to open before him the career of a royal ambition: but the circum|&s;tances in which he is de&s;tined to act, are very different from tho&s;e of a king. He encounters with men who are unu&s;ed to di&s;parity; he is obli|ged, for his own &s;ecurity, to hold the dagger con|tinually un&s;heathed. When he hopes to be &s;afe, po&s;&s;ibly means to be ju&s;t; but is hurried, from the fir&s;t moment of his u&s;urpation, into every ex|erci&s;e of de&s;potical power. The heir of a crown has no &s;uch quarrel to maintain with his &s;ubjects: his &s;ituation is flattering; and the heart mu&s;t be uncommonly bad, that does not glow with affec|tion to a people, who are, at once, his admirers, his &s;upport, and the ornaments of his reign. In him, perhaps, there is no explicit de&s;ign of tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ing on the rights of his &s;ubjects; but the forms intended to pre&s;erve their freedom, are not, on this account, always &s;afe in his hands.</P>
<P>SLAVERY has been impo&s;ed upon mankind in the wantonne&s;s of a depraved ambition, and tyran|nical cruelties have been committed in the gloomy hours of jealou&s;y and terror: yet the&s;e demons are not nece&s;&s;ary to the creation, or to the &s;upport of an arbitrary power.

that freedom is a clog on the proceedings of government: they imagine, that de&s;potical power is be&s;t fitted to procure di&s;patch and &s;ecrecy in the execution of public councils; to maintain what they are plea&s;ed to call <HI>political order</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our notion of order in civil &s;ociety is frequently fal&s;e: it is taken from the analogy of &s;ubjects inanimate and dead; we con&s;ider commotion and action as contrary to its nature; we think it con&s;i&s;tent only with obedience, &s;ecrecy, and the &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ing of affairs through the hands of a few.

let him collect the force of the &s;tate again&s;t its enemies, by availing him&s;elf of all it can furni&s;h in the way of taxation and per&s;onal &s;ervice: it is extremely probable, that, even under the direction of wi&s;hes for the good of mankind, he may break through every barrier of liberty, and e&s;tabli&s;h a de&s;poti&s;m, while he flatters him&s;elf, that he only follows the dictates of &s;en&s;e and propriety.</P>
<P>WHEN we &s;uppo&s;e government to have be|&s;towed a degree of tranquility which we &s;ometimes hope to reap from it, as the be&s;t of its fruits, and public affairs to proceed, in the &s;everal depart|ments of legi&s;lation and execution, with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible interruption to commerce and lucrative arts; &s;uch a &s;tate, like that of China, by throw|ing affairs into &s;eparate offices, where conduct con|&s;i&s;ts in detail, and in the ob&s;ervance of forms, by &s;uper&s;eding all the exertions of a great or a liberal mind, is more akin to de&s;poti&s;m than we are apt to imagine.</P>
<P>WHETHER oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice, and cruelty, are the only evils which attend on de&s;potical go|vernment, may be con&s;idered apart. In the mean time it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that liberty is never in greater danger than it is when we mea&s;ure nati|onal felicity by the ble&s;&s;ings which a prince may be&s;tow, or by the mere tranquility which may attend on equitable admini&s;tration. The &s;overeign may dazzle with his heroic qualities; he may pro|tect his &s;ubjects in the enjoyment of every ani|mal advantage or plea&s;ure: but the benefits ari|&s;ing from liberty are of a different &s;ort; they are not the fruits of a virtue, and of a goodne&s;s, which operate in the brea&s;t of one man, but the commu|nication of virtue it&s;elf to many; and &s;uch a di|&s;tribution

<P>THE be&s;t con&s;titutions of government are at|tended with inconvenience; and the exerci&s;e of li|berty may, on many occa&s;ions, give ri&s;e to com|plains. When we are intent on reforming abu&s;es, the abu&s;es of freedom may lead us to incroach on the &s;ubject from which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e.

<P>SLAVERY, however, is not always introduced by mere mi&s;take; it is &s;ometimes impo&s;ed in the &s;pirit of violence and rapine.

The&s;e preten&s;ions have a dangerous a&s;pect to the per&s;on, the property, or the life of every &s;ubject; they alarm every pa&s;|&s;ion in the human brea&s;t; they di&s;turb the &s;upine; they deprive the venal of his hire; they declare war on the corrupt as well as the virtuous; they are tamely admitted only by the coward; but even to him mu&s;t be &s;upported by a force that can work on his fears.

WHEN a people is accu&s;tomed to arms, it is dif|ficult for a part to &s;ubdue the whole; or before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of di&s;ciplined armies, it is difficult for any u&s;urper to govern the many by the help of a few. The&s;e difficulties, however, the policy of civilized and commercial nations has &s;ometimes re|moved; and by forming a di&s;tinction between civil and military profe&s;&s;ions, by committing the keep|ing and the enjoyment of liberty to different hands, has prepared the way for the dangerous alliance of faction with military power, in oppo&s;ition to mere political forms, and the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE who are di&s;armed in compliance with this fatal refinement, have re&s;ted their &s;afety on the pleadings of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice at the tribunal of ambition and of &s;orce. In &s;uch an extremity, laws are quoted, and &s;enates are a&s;&s;embled, in vain. They who compo&s;e a legi&s;lature, or who occupy the civil departments of &s;tate, may deliberate on the me&s;&s;ages they receive from the camp or the court; but if the bearer, like the centurion who brought the petition of Octavius to the Roman &s;e|nate, &s;hew the hilt of his &s;word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton.</NOTE>, they find that petitions are become commands, and that they them&s;elves are become the pageants, not the repo|&s;itories of &s;overeign power.</P>
<P>THE reflections of this &s;ection may be une|qually applied to nations of unequal extent. Small communities, however corrupted, are not prepared for de&s;potical government: their members crouded together, and contiguous to the &s;eats of power, never forget their relation to the public; they pry, with habits of familiarity and freedom, into the

preten&s;ions of tho&s;e who would rule; and where the love of equality, and the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, have failed, they act on motives of faction, emulation, and envy. The exiled Tarquin had his adherents at Rome; but if by their means he had recovered his &s;tation, it is probable, that in the exerci&s;e of his royalty, he mu&s;t have entered on a new &s;cene of contention with the very party that re&s;tored him to power.</P>

Di|&s;tance from the &s;eats of admini&s;tration, and indif|ference to the per&s;ons who contend for preferment, teach the majority to con&s;ider them&s;elves as the &s;ubjects of a &s;overeignty, not as the members of a political body. It is even remarkable, that enlarge|ment of territory, by rendering the individual of le&s;s con&s;equence to the public, and le&s;s able to in|trude with his coun&s;el, actually tends to reduce na|tional affairs within a narrower compa&s;s, as well as to dimini&s;h the numbers who are con&s;ulted in legi|&s;lation, or in other matters of government.</P>
<P>THE di&s;orders to which a great empire is ex|po&s;ed, require &s;peedy prevention, vigilance, and quick execution.

<P>MANKIND, when they degenerate, and tend to their ruin, as well as when they improve, and gain real advantages, frequently proceed by &s;low, and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, &s;teps. If, during ages of activity and vigour, they fill up the mea&s;ure of national greatne&s;s to a height which no human wi&s;|dom could at a di&s;tance fore&s;ee; they actually in|cur, in ages of relaxation and weakne&s;s, many evils which their fears did not &s;ugge&s;t, and which, per|haps, they had thought far removed by the tide of &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that where men are remi&s;s or corrupted, the virtue of their leaders, or the good intention of their magi&s;trates, will not al|ways &s;ecure them in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of political free|dom. Implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any leader, or the un|controuled exerci&s;e of any power, even when it is
<PB N="407" REF="414">
intended to operate for the good of mankind, may frequently end in the &s;ubver&s;ion of legal e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. This fatal revolution, by whatever means it is accompli&s;hed, terminates in military govern|ment; and this, though the &s;imple&s;t of all govern|ments, is rendered complete by degrees. In the fir&s;t period of its exerci&s;e over men who have acted as members of a free community, it can have only laid the foundation, not completed the fabric, of a de&s;potical policy. The u&s;urper, who has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an army, the centre of a great empire, &s;ees around him, perhaps, the &s;hattered remains of a former con&s;titution; he may hear the murmurs of a reluctant and unwilling &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; he may even &s;ee danger in the a&s;pect of many, from who&s;e hands he may have wre&s;ted the &s;word, but who&s;e minds he has not &s;ubdued, nor reconciled to his power.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal rights, or the preten&s;ion to privilege and honours, which remain among cer|tain orders of men, are &s;o many bars in the way of a recent u&s;urpation. If they are not &s;uffered to de|cay with age, and to wear away in the progre&s;s of a growing corruption, they mu&s;t be broken with vio|lence, and the entrance to every new acce&s;&s;ion of power mu&s;t be &s;tained with blood. The effect, e|ven in this ca&s;e, is frequently tardy. The Roman &s;pirit, we know, was not entirely extingui&s;hed under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ma&s;ters, and under a repeated applica|tion of blood&s;hed and poi&s;on. The noble and re&s;pect|able family &s;till a&s;pired to its original honours: the hi&s;tory of the republic, the writings of former times, the monuments of illu&s;trious men, and the le&s;&s;ons of a philo&s;ophy fraught with heroic conceptions, continued to nouri&s;h the &s;oul in retirement, and formed tho&s;e eminent characters, who&s;e elevation,

Though unable to oppo&s;e the general bent to &s;ervility, they became, on ac|count of their &s;uppo&s;ed inclinations, objects of di|&s;tru&s;t and aver&s;ion; and were made to pay with their blood, the price of a &s;entiment which they fo&s;|tered in &s;ilence, and which glowed only in the heart.</P>
<P>WHILE de&s;poti&s;m proceeds in its progre&s;s, by what principle is the &s;overeign conducted in the choice of mea&s;ures that tend to e&s;tabli&s;h his govern|ment? By a mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ion of his own good, &s;ometimes even of that of his people, and by the de|&s;ire which he feels on every particular occa&s;ion, to remove the ob&s;tructions which impede the execu|tion of his will. When he has fixed a re&s;olution, whoever rea&s;ons or demon&s;trates again&s;t it is an e|nemy; when his mind is elated, whoever pretends to erninence, and is di&s;po&s;ed to act for him&s;elf, is a rival. He would leave no dignity in the &s;tate, but what is dependent on him&s;elf; no active power, but what carries the expre&s;&s;ion of his momentary plea&s;ure. Guided by a perception as unerring as that of in&s;tinct, he never fails to &s;elect the proper objects of his antipathy or of his favour. The a&s;|pect of independence repels him; that of &s;ervi|lity attracts. The tendency of his admini&s;tration is to quiet every re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, and to a&s;&s;ume every function of government to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ridiculous to hear men of a re&s;tle&s;s ambition, who would be the only actors in every &s;cene, &s;ometimes complain of a refrac|tory &s;pirit in mankind; as if the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition from which they de&s;ire to u&s;urp every office, did not incline every other per&s;on to rea&s;on and to act at lea&s;t for him&s;elf.</NOTE>.

OPPRESSION and cruelty are not always ne|ce&s;&s;ary to de&s;potical government; and even when pre&s;ent, are but a part of its evils. It is founded on corruption, and on the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all the civil and the political virtues; it requires its &s;ubjects to act from motives of fear; it would a&s;&s;wage the pa&s;&s;ions of a few men at the expence of mankind; and would erect the peace of &s;ociety it&s;elf on the ruins of that freedom and confidence from which alone the enjoyment, the force, and the elevation of the human mind, are found to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>DURING the exi&s;tence of any free con&s;titution, and whil&s;t every individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his rank and his privilege, or had his apprehen&s;ion of per&s;onal rights, the members of every community were to one another objects of con&s;ideration and of re&s;pect; every point to be carried in civil &s;ociety, required the exerci&s;e of talents, of wi&s;dom, per&s;ua&s;ion, and vigour, as well as of power. But it is the high|e&s;t refinement of a de&s;potical government, to rule by &s;imple commands, and to exclude every art but that of compul&s;ion. Under the influence of this policy, therefore, the occa&s;ions which employed and cultivated the under&s;tandings of men, which awakened their &s;entiments, and kindled their ima|ginations, are gradually removed; and the progre&s;s by which mankind attained to the honours of their nature, in being engaged to act in &s;ociety upon a liberal footing, was not more uniform, or le&s;s in|terrupted, than that by which they degenerate in this unhappy condition.</P>

mandates of government. No arts, indeed, are required to maintain an a&s;cendant where terror a|lone is oppo&s;ed to force, where the powers of the &s;overeign are delegated entire to every &s;ubordinate officer: nor can any &s;tation be&s;tow a liberality of mind in a &s;cene of &s;ilence and dejection, where every brea&s;t is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with jealou&s;y and caution, and where no object, but animal plea&s;ure, remains to balance the &s;ufferings of the &s;overeign him&s;elf, or tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IN other &s;tates, the talents of men are &s;ome|times improved by the exerci&s;es which belong to an eminent &s;tation: but here the ma&s;ter him&s;elf is probably the rude&s;t and lea&s;t cultivated animal of the herd; he is inferior to the &s;lave whom he rai&s;es from a &s;ervile office to the fir&s;t places of tru&s;t or of dignity in his court.

<P>CAPRICE and pa&s;&s;ion are the rules of govern|ment with the prince. Every delegate of power is left to act by the &s;ame direction; to &s;trike when he is provoked; to favour when he is plea&s;ed. In what relates to revenue, juri&s;diction, or police, e|very governor of a province acts like a leader in an enemy's country; comes armed with the terrors of fire and &s;word; and in&s;tead of a tax, levies a contribution by force: he ruins or &s;pares as either

When the clamours of the oppre&s;&s;ed, or the reputation of a trea&s;ure ama&s;&s;ed at the expence of a province, have reached the ears of the &s;overeign, the extortioner is indeed made to purcha&s;e impunity by imparting a &s;hare, or by forfeiting the whole of his &s;poil; but no reparation is made to the injured; nay, the crimes of the mini|&s;ter are fir&s;t employed to plunder the people, and af|terwards puni&s;hed to fill the coffers of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IN this total di&s;continuance of every art that re|lates to ju&s;t government and national policy, it is remarkable, that even the trade of the &s;oldier is it&s;elf greatly neglected. Di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y on the part of the prince, come in aid of his igno|rance and incapacity; and the&s;e cau&s;es operating together, &s;erve to de&s;troy the very foundation on which his power is e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>THE Romans extended their empire till they left no poli&s;hed nation to be &s;ubdued, and found a frontier which was every where &s;urrounded by fierce and barbarous tribes; they even pierced through uncultivated de&s;erts, in order to remove to a greater di&s;tance the mole&s;tation of &s;uch trouble|&s;ome neighbours, and in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ave|nues through which they feared their attacks. But this policy put the fini&s;hing hand to the internal corruption of the &s;tate. A few years of tranquility were &s;ufficient to make even the government forget its danger; and in the cultivated province, prepared
<PB N="413" REF="420">
for the enemy, a tempting prize and an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>WHEN by the conque&s;t and annexation of every rich and cultivated province, the mea&s;ure of empire is full, two parties are &s;ufficient to comprehend mankind; that of the pacific and the wealthy, who dwell within the pale of empire; and that of the poor, the rapacious, and the fierce, who are inured to depredation and war. The la&s;t bear to the fir&s;t nearly the &s;ame relation which the wolf and the lion bear to the fold; and they are naturally en|gaged in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>WERE de&s;potic empire, mean-time, to con|tinue for ever unmole&s;ted from abroad, while it retains that corruption on which it was founded, it appears to have in it&s;elf no principle of new life, and pre&s;ents no hope of re&s;toration to freedom and political vigour. That which the de&s;potical <HI>ma&s;ter has &s;own, cannot quicken unle&s;s it die</HI>; it mu&s;t lan|gui&s;h and expire by the effect of its own abu&s;e, before the human &s;pirit can &s;pring up anew, or bear tho&s;e fruits which con&s;titute the honour and the felicity of human nature. In times of the great|e&s;t deba&s;ement, indeed, commotions are felt; but very unlike the agitations of a free people: they are either the agonies of nature, under the &s;uffer|ings to which men are expo&s;ed; or mere tumults, confined to a few who &s;tand in arms about the prince, and who, by their con&s;piracies, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inati|ons, and murders, &s;erve only to plunge the pacific inhabitant &s;till deeper in the horrors of fear or de|&s;pair. Scattered in the provinces, unarmed, un|acquainted with the &s;entiments of union and con|federacy, re&s;tricted by habit to a wretched oeco|nomy,
<PB N="414" REF="421">
and dragging a precarious life on tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which the extortions of government have left; the people can no where, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, a&s;&s;ume the &s;pirit of a community, nor form any liberal combination for their own de|fence. The injured may complain; and while he cannot obtain the mercy of government, he may implore the commi&s;eration of his fellow-&s;ubject. But that fellow-&s;ubject is comforted, that the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion has not &s;eized on him&s;elf: he &s;tudies his intere&s;t, or &s;natches his plea&s;ure, under that degree of &s;afety which ob&s;curity and concealment be&s;tow.</P>
<P>THE commercial arts, which &s;eem to require no foundation in the minds of men, but the re|gard to intere&s;t; no encouragement, but the hopes of gain, and the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, mu&s;t peri&s;h under the precarious tenure of &s;lavery, and under the apprehen&s;ion of danger ari&s;ing from the reputation of wealth. National poverty, however, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of commerce, are the means by which de&s;poti&s;m comes to accompli&s;h its own de&s;truction. Where there are no longer any pro|fits to corrupt, or fears to deter, the charm of dominion is broken, and the naked &s;lave, as awake from a dream, is a&s;toni&s;hed to find he is free. When the fence is de&s;troyed, the wilds are open, and the herd breaks loo&s;e. The pa&s;ture of the cultivated field is no longer preferred to that of the de&s;ert. The &s;ufferer willingly flies where the extortions of government cannot overtake him; where even the timid and the &s;ervile may recollect they are men; where the tyrant may threaten, but where he is known to be no more than a fel|low-creature; where he can take nothing but life, and even this at the hazard of his own.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="422">
AGREEABLY to this de&s;cription, the vexations of tyranny have overcome, in many parts of the Ea&s;t, the de&s;ire of &s;ettlement. The inhabitants of a village quit their habitations, and infe&s;t the public ways; tho&s;e of the valleys fly to the moun|tains, and, equipt for flight, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong hold, &s;ub&s;i&s;t by depredation, and by the war they make on their former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>THESE di&s;orders con&s;pire with the impo&s;itions of government to render the remaining &s;ettlements &s;till le&s;s &s;ecure: but while deva&s;tation and ruin appear on every &s;ide, mankind are forced anew upon tho&s;e confederacies, acquire again that per|&s;onal confidence and vigour, that &s;ocial attach|ment, that u&s;e of arms, which, in former times, rendered a &s;mall tribe the &s;eed of a great nation; and which may again enable the emancipated &s;lave to begin the career of civil and commercial arts. When human nature appears in the utmo&s;t &s;tate of corruption, it has actually begun to reform.</P>
<P>IN this manner, the &s;cenes of human life have been frequently &s;hifted. Security and pre&s;umption forfeit the advantages of pro&s;perity; re&s;olution and conduct retrieve the ills of adver&s;ity; and mankind, while they have nothing on which to rely but their virtue, are prepared to gain every advantage; and when they confide mo&s;t in their fortune, are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to feel its rever&s;e: We are apt to draw the&s;e ob&s;ervations into rule; and when we are no longer willing to act for our coun|try, we plead in excu&s;e of our own weakne&s;s or folly, a &s;uppo&s;ed fatality in human affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="423">
THE in&s;titutions of men are, indeed, likely to have their end as well as their beginning: but their duration is not fixed to any limited period; and no nation ever &s;uffered internal decay but from the vice of its members. We are &s;ometimes will|ing to acknowledge this vice in our countrymen; but who was ever willing to acknowledge it in him&s;elf? It may be &s;u&s;pected, however, that we do more than acknowledge it, when we cea&s;e to oppo&s;e its effects, and when we plead a fatality, which at lea&s;t, in the brea&s;t of every individual, is dependent on him&s;elf. Men of real fortitude, in|tegrity, and ability, are well placed in every &s;cene; they reap, in every condition, the principal enjoy|ments of their nature; they are the happy in&s;tru|ments of providence employed for the good of mankind; or, if we mu&s;t change this language, they &s;how, that while they are de&s;tined to live, the &s;tates they compo&s;e are likewi&s;e doomed by the &s;ates to &s;urvive, and to pro&s;per.</P>
