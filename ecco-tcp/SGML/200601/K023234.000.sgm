<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following little Piece was written in the win|ter of 1795 and 96; and, as I had not determined whether to publi&s;h it during the pre&s;ent war, or to wait till the commencement of a peace, it has lain by me, without alteration or addition, from the time it was written.</P>
<P>What has determined me to publi&s;h it now is, a Ser|mon, preached by WATSON, <HI>Bi&s;hop of Landaff.</HI> Some of my readers will recollect, that this Bi&s;hop wrote a Book, entitled <HI>An Apology for the Bible,</HI> in an&s;wer to my <HI>Second part of the Age of Rea&s;on.</HI> I procured a copy of his book, and he may depend upon hearing from me on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At the end of the Bi&s;hop's book is a Li&s;t of the Works he has written, among which is the Sermon alluded to; it is entitled,<Q>"THE WISDOM AND GOODNESS OF GOD IN HAVING MADE BOTH RICH AND POOR; with an Ap|pendix containing REFLECTIONS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE."</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The error contained in the title of this Sermon deter|mined me to publi&s;h my AGRARIAN JUSTICE. It is wrong to &s;ay that God made <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor</HI>; he made only <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female</HI>; and he gave them the earth for their inheritance. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>In&s;tead of preaching to encourage one part of man|kind in in&s;olence * * * * * * * it would be better that prie&s;ts employed their time to ren|der the general condition of man le&s;s mi&s;erable than it is. Practical religion con&s;i&s;ts in doing good; and the only way of &s;erving God is, that of endeavouring to make his creation happy.&mdash;All preaching that has not this for its object is non&s;en&s;e and hypocri&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>AGRARIAN JUSTICE, OPPOSED TO AGRARIAN LAW, AND TO AGRARIAN MONOPOLY. BEING A PLAN FOR Meliorating the Condition of Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO pre&s;erve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy, at the &s;ame time, the evils it has pro|duced, ought to be con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t objects of re|formed legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>Whether that &s;tate that is proudly, perhaps erroneou&s;ly, called civilization, has mo&s;t promoted or mo&s;t injured the ge|neral happine&s;s of man, is a que&s;tion that may be &s;trongly con|te&s;ted. On one &s;ide the &s;pectator is dazzled by &s;plendid ap|pearances; on the other, he is &s;hocked by extremes of wretchedne&s;s; both of which he has erected. The mo&s;t af|fluent and the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the human race are to be found in the countries that are called civilized.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand what the &s;tate of &s;ociety ought to be, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome idea of the natural and primitive &s;tate of man; &s;uch as it is at this day among the Indians of North
<PB N="6" REF="5">
America. There is not, in that &s;tate, any of tho&s;e &s;pectacles of human mi&s;ery which poverty and want pre&s;ent to our eyes in all the towns and &s;treets in Europe. Poverty therefore is a thing created by that which is called civilized life. It exi&s;ts not in the natural &s;tate. On the other hand, the natural &s;tate is without tho&s;e advantages which flow from Agriculture, Arts, Science, and Manufactures.</P>
<P>The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of Europe; and, on the other hand, it appears to be abject when compared with the rich. Civilization, therefore, or that which is &s;o called, has operated two ways, to make one part of &s;ociety more affluent, and the other part more wretched than would have been the lot of either in a natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is always po&s;&s;ible to go from the natural to the civilized &s;tate, but it is never po&s;&s;ible to go from the civilized to the natural &s;tate. The rea&s;on is, that man, in a natural &s;tate, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by hunting, requires ten times the quantity of land to range over to procure him&s;elf &s;u&s;tenance, than would &s;up|port him in a civilized &s;tate, where the earth is cultivated. When therefore a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation, arts, and &s;cience, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving things in that &s;tate; becau&s;e, without it, there can|not be &s;u&s;tenance for more, perhaps, than a tenth part of its inhabitants. The thing therefore now to be done, is, to re|medy the evils, and pre&s;erve the benefits that have ari&s;en to &s;ociety, by pa&s;&s;ing from the natural to that which is called the civilized &s;tate.</P>
<P>Taking then the matter upon this ground, the fir&s;t principle of civilization ought to have been, and ought &s;till to be, that the condition of every per&s;on born into the world, after a &s;tate of civilization commences, ought not to be wor&s;e than if he
<PB N="7" REF="6">
had been born before that period. But the fact is, that the condition of millions in every country in Europe is far wor&s;e than if they had been born before civilization began, or had been born among the Indians of North America of the pre&s;ent day, I will &s;hew how this fact has happened.</P>
<P>It is a po&s;ition not to be controverted, that the earth, in its natural uncultivated &s;tate, was, and ever would have continued to be, the COMMON PROPERTY OF THE HUMAN RACE. In that &s;tate every man would have been born to property. He would have been a joint life-proprietor with the re&s;t in the property of the &s;oil, and in all its natural productions, vege|table and animal.</P>
<P>But the earth in its natural &s;tate, as before &s;aid, is capable of &s;upporting but a &s;mall number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing in a cultivated &s;tate. And as it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the improvement made by cultivation from the earth it&s;elf, upon which that improvement is made, the idea of landed property aro&s;e from that in&s;eparable con|nection; but it is neverthele&s;s true, that it is the value of the improvement only, and not the earth it&s;elf, that is individual property. Every proprietor therefore of cultivated land owes to the community a <HI>ground-rent</HI>; for I know no better term to expre&s;s the idea by for the land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent that the fund propo&s;ed in this plan is to i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing, as from all the hi&s;tories tran&s;mitted to us, that the idea of landed pro|perty commenced with cultivation, and that there was no &s;uch thing as landed property before that time. It could not exi&s;t in the fir&s;t &s;tate of man, that of hunters; it did not exi&s;t in the &s;econd &s;tate, that of &s;hepherds: Neither Abraham, I&s;aac,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Jacob, or Job, &s;o far as the hi&s;tory of the Bible may be cre|dited in probable things, were owners of land. Their property con&s;i&s;ted, as is always enumerated, in flocks and herds, and they travelled with them from place to place. The frequent contentions at that time about the u&s;e of a well in the dry country of Arabia, where tho&s;e people lived, &s;hew al&s;o there was no landed property. It was not admitted that land could be located as property.</P>
<P>There could be no &s;uch thing as landed property originally. Man did not make the earth, and, though he had a natural right to <HI>occupy</HI> it, he had no right to <HI>locate</HI> as <HI>his property</HI> in perpetuity any part of it: neither did the Creator of the earth open a land-office, from whence the fir&s;t title-deeds &s;hould i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;From whence then aro&s;e the idea of landed property? I an&s;wer as before, that when cultivation began, the idea of landed property began with it; from the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;epa|rating the improvement made by cultivation from the earth it|&s;elf upon which that improvement was made. The value of the improvement &s;o far exceeded the value of the natural earth, at that time, as to ab&s;orb it; till, in the end, the common right of all became confounded into the cultivated right of the individual. But they are neverthele&s;s di&s;tinct &s;pecies of rights, and will continue to be &s;o as long as the world endures.</P>
<P>It is only by tracing things to their origin, that we can gain rightful ideas of them; and it is by gaining &s;uch ideas that we di&s;cover the boundary that divides right from wrong, and which teaches every man to know his own. I have entitled this tract <HI>Agrarian Ju&s;tice,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>Agrarian Law.</HI> Nothing could be more unju&s;t than Agrarian Law in a country improved by cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant of the earth, is a joint proprietor of it in its na|tural &s;tate, it does not follow that he is a joint proprietor of
<PB N="9" REF="8">
cultivated earth. The additional value made by cultivation, after the &s;y&s;tem was admitted, became the property of tho&s;e who did it, or who inherited it from them, or who purcha&s;ed it. It had originally an owner. Whil&s;t, therefore, I advo|cate the right, and intere&s;t my&s;elf in the hard ca&s;e of all tho&s;e who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the introduction of the &s;y&s;tem of landed property, I equally de|fend the right of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the part which is his.</P>
<P>Cultivation is, at lea&s;t, one of the greate&s;t improvements ever made by human invention. It has given to created earth a ten-fold value. But the landed monopoly, that began with it, has produced the greate&s;t evil. It has di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their natural inhe|ritance, without providing for them, as ought to have been done as an indemnification for that lo&s;s, and has thereby cre|ated a &s;pecies of poverty and wretchedne&s;s that did not exi&s;t be|fore.</P>
<P>In advocating the ca&s;e of the per&s;ons thus di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it is a right and not a charity that I am pleading for. But it is that kind of right which, being neglected at fir&s;t, could not be brought forward afterwards, till heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the &s;y&s;tem of government. Let us then do ho|nour to revolutions by ju&s;tice, and give currency to their prin|ciples by ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Having thus in a few words opened the merits of the ca&s;e, I proceed to the plan I have to propo&s;e, which is&mdash;<Q><HI>To create a National Fund, out of which there &s;hall be paid to every per&s;on, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the &s;um of</HI> Fifteen Pounds &s;terling, <HI>as a compen&s;ation in part for the lo&s;s of his or her natural inheritance by the introduc|tion of the &s;y&s;tem of landed property.</HI></Q>
<PB N="10" REF="9">AND ALSO,<Q><HI>The &s;um of</HI> Ten Pounds per annum, <HI>during life, to every per&s;on now living of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they &s;hall arrive at that age.</HI></Q></P>
<P>MEANS BY WHICH THE FUND IS TO BE CREATED.</P>
<P>I have already e&s;tabli&s;hed the principle, namely, that the earth, in its natural uncultivated &s;tate, was, and ever would have continued to be, the COMMON PROPERTY OF THE HU|MAN RACE&mdash;that in that &s;tate every per&s;on would have been born to property&mdash;and that the &s;y&s;tem of landed property, by its in&s;eparable connection with cultivation, and with what is called civilized life, has ab&s;orbed the property of all tho&s;e whom it di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without providing, as ought to have been done, an indemnification for that lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The fault, however, is not in the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. No complaint is intended, or ought to be alledged again&s;t them, unle&s;s they adopt the crime by oppo&s;ing ju&s;tice. The fault is in the &s;y&s;tem, and it has &s;tolen imperceptibly upon the world, aided afterwards by the Agrarian law of the &s;word. But the fault can be made to reform it&s;elf by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, without dimini&s;hing or deranging the property of any of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and yet the operation of the fund can com|mence, and be in full activity the fir&s;t year of its e&s;tabli&s;hment, or &s;oon after, as I &s;hall &s;hew.</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed that the payments, as already &s;tated, be made to every per&s;on, rich or poor. It is be&s;t to make it &s;o, to pre|vent invidious di&s;tinctions. It is al&s;o right it &s;hould be &s;o, becau&s;e it is in lieu of the natural inheritance, which, as a right, belongs to every man, over and above the property he may have created or inherited from tho&s;e who did. Such per|&s;ons
<PB N="11" REF="10">
as do not chu&s;e to receive it, can throw it into the com|mon fund.</P>
<P>Taking it then for granted, that no per&s;on ought to be in a wor&s;e condition when born under what is called a &s;tate of ci|vilization, than he would have been, had he been born in a &s;tate of nature, and that civilization ought to have made, and ought &s;till to make, provi&s;ion for that purpo&s;e, it can only be done by &s;ubtracting from property a portion equal in value to the natural inheritance it has ab&s;orbed.</P>
<P>Various methods may be propo&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, but that which appears to be the be&s;t, not only becau&s;e it will operate without deranging any pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or without interfering with the collection of taxes, or emprunts nece&s;&s;ary for the pur|po&s;e of goverment and the revolution, but becau&s;e it will be the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome and the mo&s;t effectual, and al&s;o becau&s;e the &s;ubtraction will be made at a time that be&s;t admits it, which is, at the moment that property is pa&s;&s;ing by the death of one per|&s;on to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another. In this ca&s;e, the bequeather gives nothing; the receiver pays nothing. The only matter to him is, that the monopoly of natural inheritance, to which there never was a right, begins to cea&s;e in his per&s;on. A ge|nerous man would wi&s;h it not to continue, and a ju&s;t man will rejoice to &s;ee it aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>My &s;tate of health prevents my making &s;ufficient enquiries with re&s;pect to the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations with &s;uch degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I offer on this head is more the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervation and reflection, than of received information; but I believe it will be found to agree &s;ufficiently enough with fact.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity, all the property of a nation, real and per&s;onal, is
<PB N="12" REF="11">
always in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons above that age. It is then nece&s;&s;ary to know, as a datum of calculation, the average of years which per&s;ons above that age will be live. I take this average to be about thirty years, for though many per&s;ons will live forty, fifty, or &s;ixty years after the age of twenty-one years, others will die much &s;ooner, and &s;ome in every year of that time.</P>
<P>Taking then thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without any material variation one way or other, the average of time in which the whole property or capital of a nation, or a &s;um equal thereto, will have pa&s;&s;ed through one entire revolution in de&s;cent, that is, will have gone by deaths to new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: for though, in many in&s;tances, &s;ome parts of this capital will remain forty, fifty, or &s;ixty years in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of one per&s;on, other parts will have revolved two or three times before that thirty years expire, which will bring it to that average; for were one half of the capital of a nation to revolve twice in thirty years, it would produce the &s;ame fund as if the whole revolved once.</P>
<P>Taking then thirty years as the average of time in which the whole capital of a nation, or a &s;um equal thereto, will re|volve once, the thirtieth part thereof will be the &s;um that will revolve every year, that is, will go by deaths to new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and this la&s;t &s;um being thus known, and the ratio per cent. to be &s;ubtracted from it being determined, will give the annual amount or income of the propo&s;ed fund, to be applied as al|ready mentioned.</P>
<P>In looking over the di&s;cour&s;e of the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, Pitt, in his opening of what is called in England the budget, (the &s;cheme of finance for the year 1796) I find an e&s;timate of the national capital of that country. As this e&s;timate of a national
<PB N="13" REF="12">
capital is prepared ready to my hand, I take it as a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon the known ca|pital of any nation combined with its population, it will &s;erve as a &s;cale for any other nation, in proportion as its capital and population be more or le&s;s. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to take this e&s;timate of Mr. Pitt, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing to that Mini&s;ter, upon his own calculation, how much better money may be employed, than in wa&s;ting it, as he has done, on the wild project of &s;etting up Bourbon kings. What, in the name of Heaven, are Bourbon kings to the people of England? It is better that the people of England have bread.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt &s;tates the national capital of England, real and per&s;onal, to be one thou&s;and three hundred millions &s;terling, which is about one fourth part of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The event of the la&s;t harve&s;t in each coun|try proves that the &s;oil of France is more productive than that of England, and that it can better &s;upport twenty-four or twenty-five millions of inhabitants than that of England can &s;even, or &s;even and an half.</P>
<P>The thirtieth part of this capital of &pound;1,300,000,000 is &pound;43,333,333, which is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that country to new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and the &s;um that will annually revolve in France in the proportion of four to one, will be about one hundred and &s;eventy-three millions &s;ter|ling. From this &s;um of &pound;43,333,333 annually revolving, is to be &s;ubtracted the value of the natural inheritance ab&s;orbed in it, which perhaps, in fair ju&s;tice, cannot be taken at le&s;s, and ought not to be taken at more than a tenth part.</P>
<P>It will always happen, that of the property thus revolving by deaths every year, part will de&s;cend in a direct line to &s;ons and daughters, and the other part collaterally, and the pro|portion will be found to be about three to one; that is, about
<PB N="14" REF="13">
thirty millions of the above &s;um will de&s;cend to direct heirs, and the remaining &s;um of &pound;13,333,333 to more distant rela|tions, and part to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering then that man is always related to &s;ociety, that relation&s;hip will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next of kin is more di&s;tant. It is therefore con&s;i&s;tent with civilization to &s;ay, that where there are no direct heirs, &s;ociety &s;hall be heir to a part over and above the tenth part due to &s;o|ciety. If this additional part be from five or ten or twelve per cent. in proportion as the next of kin be nearer or more re|mote, &s;o as to average with the e&s;cheats that may fall, which ought always to go to &s;ociety and not to the government, an addition of ten per cent more, the produce from the annual &s;um of&mdash;&pound;.43,333,333 will be,<TABLE>

<P>Having thus arrived at the annual amount of the propo&s;ed fund, I come, in the next place, to &s;peak of the population proportioned to this fund, and to compare it with u&s;es to which the fund is to be applied.</P>
<P>The population (I mean that of England) does not exceed &s;even millions and a half, and the number of per&s;ons above the age of fifty, will, in that ca&s;e, be about four hundred thou|&s;and. There would not, however, be more than that number that would accept the propo&s;ed ten pounds &s;terling per annum, though they would be entitled to it. I have no idea it would be accepted by many per&s;ons who had a yearly income of two or three hundred pounds &s;terling But as we often &s;ee in|&s;tances
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of rich people falling into &s;udden poverty, even at the age of &s;ixty, they would always have the right of drawing all the arrears due to them.&mdash;Four millions, therefore, of the above annual &s;um of &pound;5,666,666, will be required for four hundred thou&s;and aged per&s;ons, at ten pounds &s;terling each.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak of the per&s;ons annually arriving at twenty-one years of age. If all the per&s;ons who died were above the age of twenty-one years, the number of per&s;ons an|nually arriving at that age mu&s;t be equal to the annual number of deaths to keep the population &s;tationary. But the greater part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the num|ber of per&s;ons annually arriving at twenty-one, will be le&s;s than half the number of deaths. The whole number of deaths upon a population of &s;even millions and a half, will be about 220,000 annually. The number at twenty-one years of age will be about 100,000. The whole number of the&s;e will not receive the propo&s;ed fifteen pounds, for the rea&s;ons already mentioned, though, as in the former ca&s;e, they would be in|titled to it. Admitting then that a tenth part declined receiv|ing it, the amount would &s;tand thus:<TABLE>

<P>There are in every country a number of blind and lame per&s;ons, totally incapable of earning a livelihood. But as it will happen that the greater number of blind per&s;ons will be among tho&s;e who are above the age of fifty years, they will be provided for in that cla&s;s. The remaining &s;um of
<PB N="16" REF="15">
&pound;.316,666 will provide for the lame and blind under that age, at the &s;ame rate of 10l. annually for each per&s;on.</P>
<P>Having now gone through all the nece&s;&s;ary calculations, and &s;tated the particulars of the plan, I &s;hall conclude with &s;ome observations.</P>
<P>It is not charity but a right&mdash;not bounty but ju&s;tice, that I am pleading for. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of what is called civi|lization is * * * * It is the rever&s;e of what it ought to be, and * * * *  The contra&s;t of affluence and wretchedne&s;s continually meeting and offending the eye, is like dead and living bodies chained together. Though I care as little about riches as any man, I am a friend to riches, becau&s;e they are capable of good. I care not how affluent &s;ome may be, provided that none be mi&s;erable in con|&s;equence of it.&mdash;But it is impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy affluence with the fecility it is capable of being enjoyed, whil&s;t &s;o much mi|&s;ery is mingled in the &s;cene. The &s;ight of the mi&s;ery, and the unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations it &s;ugge&s;ts, which, though they may be &s;uffocated, cannot be extingui&s;hed, are a greater drawback upon the felicity of affluence than the propo&s;ed 10 per cent. upon property is worth. He that would not give the one to get rid of the other, has no charity, even for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are in every country &s;ome magnificent charities e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by individuals. It is however but little that any indi|vidual can do, when the whole extent of the mi&s;ery to be re|lieved be con&s;idered. He may &s;atisfy his con&s;cience, but not his heart. He may give all that he has, and that all will re|lieve but little. It is only by organizing civilization upon &s;uch principles as to act like a &s;y&s;tem of pullies, that the whole weight of mi&s;ery can be removed.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
The plan here propo&s;ed will reach the whole. It will im|mediately relieve and take out of view three cla&s;&s;es of wretch|edne&s;s&mdash;the blind, the lame, and the aged poor; and it will furni&s;h the ri&s;ing generation with means to prevent their be|coming poor; and it will do this, without deranging or inter|fering with any national mea&s;ures. To &s;hew that this will be the ca&s;e, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the operation and effect of the plan will, in all ca&s;es, be the &s;ame, as if every individual was <HI>voluntarily</HI> to make his will, and di&s;po&s;e of his property, in the manner here propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it is ju&s;tice and not charity, that is the principle of the plan. In all great ca&s;es it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a principle more univer&s;ally active than charity; and with re&s;pect to ju&s;tice, it ought not to be left to the choice of detached individuals, whe|ther they will do ju&s;tice or not. Con&s;idering then the plan on the ground of ju&s;tice, it ought to be the act of the whole, grow|ing &s;pontaneou&s;ly out of the principles of the revolution, and the reputation of it to be national, and not individual.</P>
<P>A plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy that &s;prings from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ju&s;tice. It would multiply al&s;o the national re&s;ources; for property, like vegetation, encrea&s;es by off-&s;ets. When a young couple be|gins the world, the difference is exceedingly great, whether they begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds a-piece. With this aid they could buy a cow, and implements to cultivate a few acres of land; and in&s;tead of becoming burthens upon &s;ociety, which is always the ca&s;e, where children are produced fa&s;ter than they can be fed, would be put in the way of becoming u&s;eful and profitable citizens. The national domains al&s;o would &s;ell the better, if pecuniary aids were provided to culti|vate them in &s;mall lots.</P>
<P>It is the practice of what has unju&s;tly obtained the name of civilization (and the practice merits not to be called either cha|rity
<PB N="18" REF="17">
or policy) to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for per&s;ons becoming poor and wretched, only at the time they become &s;o.&mdash;Would it not, even as a matter of economy, be far better, to devi&s;e means to prevent their becoming poor? This can be&s;t be done by making every per&s;on, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, an inheritor of &s;omething to begin with. The rug|ged face of &s;ociety, checquered with the extremes of affluence and of want, proves that &s;ome extraordinary violence has been committed upon it, and calls on ju&s;tice for redre&s;s. The great ma&s;s of the poor, in all countries, are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for them to get out of that &s;tate of them&s;elves. It ought al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that this ma&s;s encrea&s;e in all the countries that are called civilized. More per&s;ons fall annually into it, than get out of it.</P>
<P>Though in a plan, in which ju&s;tice and humanity are the foundation principles, intere&s;t ought not to be admitted into the calculation, yet it is always of advantage to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of any plan, to &s;hew that it is beneficial as a matter of intere&s;t. The &s;ucce&s;s of any propo&s;ed plan, &s;ubmitted to pub|lic con&s;ideration, mu&s;t finally depend on the numbers inte|re&s;ted in &s;upporting it, united with the ju&s;tice of its prin|ciples.</P>
<P>The plan here propo&s;ed will benefit all without injuring any. It will con&s;olidate the intere&s;t of the republic with that of the individual. To the numerous cla&s;s di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their natural inheritance by the &s;y&s;tem of landed property, it will be an act of national ju&s;tice. To per&s;ons dying po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of moderate fortunes, it will operate as a tontine to their children, more beneficial than the &s;um of money paid into the fund; and it will give to the accumulation of riches a degree of &s;ecu|rity that none of the old governments of Europe, now totter|ing on their foundations, can give.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
I do not &s;uppo&s;e that more than one family in ten, in any of the countries of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear property left of five hundred pounds &s;terling, To all &s;uch the plan is advantageous. That property would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if there were only two children under age, they would receive fifteen pounds each (thirty pounds) on coming of age, and be entitled to ten pounds a year after fifty. It is from the overgrown acqui&s;ition of property that the fund will &s;upport it&s;elf; and I know that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch property in England, though they would eventually be bene|fited by the protection of nine tenths of it, will exclaim again&s;t the plan. But, without entering into any enquiry how they came by that property, let them recollect, that they have been the advocates of this war, and that Mr. Pitt has already laid on more new taxes to be rai&s;ed annually upon the people of England, and that for &s;upporting the de&s;poti&s;m of Au&s;tria and the Bourbons, again&s;t the liberties of France, than would an|nually pay all the &s;ums propo&s;ed in this plan.</P>
<P>I have made the calculations, &s;tated in this plan, upon what is called per&s;onal, as well as upon landed property. The rea&s;on for making it upon land is already explained; and the rea&s;on for taking per&s;onal property into the calculation, is equally well founded, though on a different principle. Land, as before &s;aid, is the free gift of the Creator in common to the human race. Per&s;onal property is the <HI>effect of Society</HI>; and it is as impo&s;&s;ible for an individual to acquire per&s;onal property without the aid of Society, as it is for him to make land origi|nally. Separate an individual from &s;ociety, and give him an i&s;land or a continent to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and he cannot acquire per&s;onal property. He cannot become rich. So in&s;eparably are the means connected with the end, in all ca&s;es, that where the former do not exi&s;t, the latter cannot be obtained. All accu|mulation therefore of per&s;onal property, beyond what a man's
<PB N="20" REF="19">
own hands produce, is derived to him by living in &s;ociety; and he owes, on every principle of ju&s;tice, of gratitude, and of civi|lization, a part of that accumulation back again to &s;ociety from whence the whole came. This is putting the matter on a ge|neral principle, and perhaps it is be&s;t to do &s;o; for if we exa|mine the ca&s;e minutely, it will be found, that the accumulation of per&s;onal property is, in many in&s;tances, the effects of pay|ing too little for the labour that produced it; the con&s;equence of which is, that the working hand peri&s;hes in old age, and the employer abounds in affluence. It is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to proportion exactly the price of labour to the profits it produces; and it will al&s;o be &s;aid, as an apology for inju&s;tice, that were a workman to receive an increa&s;e of wages daily, he would not &s;ave it again&s;t old age, nor be much the better for it in the interim. Make then Society the trea&s;urer to guard it for him in a common fund, for it is no rea&s;on that becau&s;e he might not make a good u&s;e of it for him&s;elf that another &s;hall take it.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of civilization that has prevailed throughout Eu|rope, is as unju&s;t in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this, and the apprehen&s;ion that &s;uch a &s;tate cannot continue when once inve&s;tigation begins in any country, that makes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of property dread every idea of a revolution. It is the <HI>hazard</HI> and not the principles of a revolution that retards their progre&s;s. This being the ca&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary, as well for the protection of property, as for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice and humanity, to form a &s;y&s;tem, that whil&s;t it pre&s;erves one part of &s;ociety from wretchedne&s;s, &s;hall &s;ecure the other from depredation.</P>
<P>The &s;uper&s;titious awe, the en&s;laven reverence, that for|merly &s;urrounded affluence, is pa&s;&s;ing away in all countries, and leaving the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of property to the convul&s;ion of acci|dents. When wealth and &s;plendour, in&s;tead of fa&s;cinating the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
multitude, excite emotions of di&s;gu&s;t; when, in&s;tead of draw|ing forth admiration, it is beheld as an in&s;ult upon wretched|ne&s;s; when the o&s;tentatious appearance it makes &s;erves to call the right of it in que&s;tion, the ca&s;e of property becomes criti|cal, and it is only in a &s;y&s;tem of ju&s;tice that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can contemplate &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>To remove the danger, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remove the antipa|thies, and this can only be done by making property productive of a national ble&s;&s;ing, extending to every individual. When the riches of one man above another &s;hall encrea&s;e the na|tional fund in the &s;ame proportion; when it &s;hall be &s;een that the pro&s;perity of that fund depends on the pro&s;perity of indivi|duals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it &s;hall be for the general ma&s;s; it is then that antipathies will cea&s;e, and property be placed on the permanent ba&s;is of na|tional intere&s;t and protection.</P>
<P>I have no property in France to become &s;ubject to the plan I propo&s;e. What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America. But I will pay one hundred pounds &s;ter|ling towards this fund in France, the in&s;tant it &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and I will pay the &s;ame &s;um in England, whenever a &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hall take place in that country.</P>
<P>A revolution in the &s;tate of civilization is the nece&s;&s;ary com|panion of revolutions in the &s;y&s;tem of government. If a revo|lution in any country be from bad to good, or from good to bad, the &s;tate of what is called civilization in that country, mu&s;t be made conformable thereto, to give that revolution effect. De&s;potic government &s;upports it&s;elf by abject civilization, in which deba&s;ement of the human mind, and wretchedne&s;s in the ma&s;s of the people, are the chief criterions. Such govern|ments con&s;ider man merely as an animal; that the exerci&s;e of intellectual faculty is not his privilege; <HI>that he has nothing to</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<HI>do with the laws, but to obey them</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Expre&s;&s;ion of Hor&s;ley, an Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop, in the Engli&s;h Parliament.</NOTE> and they politically de|pend more upon breaking the &s;pirit of the people by poverty, than they fear enraging it by de&s;peration.</P>
<P>It is a revolution in the &s;tate of civilization that will give perfection to the revolution of France. Already the conviction that government, by repre&s;entation, is the true &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, is &s;preading it&s;elf fa&s;t in the world. The rea&s;onablene&s;s of it can be &s;een by all. The ju&s;tne&s;s of it makes it&s;elf felt even by its oppo&s;ers. But when a &s;y&s;tem of civilization, grow|ing out of that &s;y&s;tem of government, &s;hall be &s;o organized, that not a man or woman born in the republic, but &s;hall inherit &s;ome means of beginning the world, and &s;ee before them the cer|tainty of e&s;caping the mi&s;eries, that under other governments accompany old age, the revolution of France will have an advo|cate and an ally in the heart of all nations.</P>
<P>An army of principles will penetrate where an army of &s;ol|diers cannot&mdash;It will &s;ucceed where diplomatic management would fail&mdash;It is neither the Rhine, the Channel, nor the Ocean, that can arre&s;t its progre&s;s&mdash;It will march on the hori|zon of the world, and it will conquer.</P>

<HEAD>Means for carrying the propo&s;ed Plan into execution, and to render it at the &s;ame time conducive to the Public Interest.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Each canton &s;hall elect in its primary a&s;&s;emblies three per&s;ons, as commi&s;&s;ioners for that canton, who &s;hall take cognizance, and keep a regi&s;ter of all matters happening in that canton, conformable to the charter that &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, for carrying this plan into execution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The law &s;hall fix the manner in which the property of decea&s;ed per&s;ons &s;hall be a&s;certained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. When the amount of the property of any decea&s;ed per&s;on &s;hall be a&s;certained, the principal heir to that property, or the elde&s;t of the co-heirs, if of lawful age, or if under age, the per&s;on authorized by the will of the decea&s;ed to repre&s;ent him or them, &s;hall give bond to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the can|ton, to pay the &s;aid tenth part thereof, within the &s;pace of one year, in four equal quarterly payments, or &s;ooner, at the choice of the payers. One half of the whole property &s;hall remain as &s;ecurity until the bond be paid off.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The bonds &s;hall be regi&s;tered in the office of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the canton, and the original bonds &s;hall be de|po&s;ited in the national bank at Paris. The bank &s;hall publi&s;h every quarter of a year the amount of the bonds in its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o the bonds that &s;hall have been paid off, or what parts thereof, &s;ince the la&s;t quarterly publication.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. The national bank &s;hall i&s;&s;ue bank notes upon the &s;e|curity of the bonds in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The notes &s;o i&s;&s;ued, &s;hall be applied to pay the pen&s;ions of aged per&s;ons, and the compen&s;ation of per&s;ons arriving at twenty-one years of age.
<PB N="24" REF="23">
It is both rea&s;onable and generous to &s;uppo&s;e, that per&s;ons not under immediate nece&s;&s;ity, will &s;u&s;pend their right of drawing on the fund, until it acquire, as it will do, a greater degree of abi|lity. In this ca&s;e, it is propo&s;ed, that an honorary regi&s;ter be kept in each canton, of the names of the per&s;ons thus &s;u&s;|pending that right, at lea&s;t during the pre&s;ent war.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. As the inheritors of property mu&s;t always take up their bonds in four quarterly payments, or &s;ooner if they chu&s;e, there will always be numeraire arriving at the bank after the expiration of the fir&s;t quarter, to exchange for the bank notes that &s;hall be brought in.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The bank notes being thus got into circulation, upon the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity, that of actual property to more than four times the amount of the bonds upon which the notes are i&s;&s;ued, and with numeraire continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off whenever they &s;hall be pre&s;ented for that purpo&s;e, they will acquire a permanent value in all parts of the republic. They can therefore be re|ceived in payment of taxes or emprunts, equal to numeraire, becau&s;e the government can always receive numeraire for them at the bank.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. It will be nece&s;&s;ary that the payments of the ten <HI>per cent.</HI> be made in numeraire for the fir&s;t year, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the plan. But after the expiration of the fir&s;t year, the inheritors of property may pay the ten <HI>per cent.</HI> either in bank notes i&s;&s;ued upon the fund, or in numeraire, it will lie as a depo&s;it at the bank; to be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal to that amount; and if in notes i&s;&s;ued upon the fund, it will cau&s;e a demand upon the fund equal thereto; and thus the operation of the plan will create means to carry it&s;elf into execution,</ITEM>
