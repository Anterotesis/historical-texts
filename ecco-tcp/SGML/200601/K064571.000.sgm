<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in GOD
<HI>RICHARD,</HI>
Lord Bi&s;hop of St. DAVID'S.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN your <HI>Sermon</HI> before
the <HI>Society</HI> for Refor|mation
of Manners,
you are plea&s;ed to give
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;e on Chri&s;t's Miracles</HI>;
Notice of them; a <HI>Favour</HI> that
I have long'd for from a con&s;idera|ble
<HI>Clergyman</HI>; but could nor flat|ter
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
my&s;elf with the Hopes of receiv|ing
it from &s;o great a <HI>Prelate.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the inferior <HI>Clergy,</HI> whom
I de&s;pi&s;e for their Ignorance and
Malice, have before in their Con|ver&s;ation
repre&s;ented me as an <HI>im|pious</HI>
and <HI>bla&s;phemous Infidel</HI>; and I
have met with Affronts for it: But
I never imagin'd that any, much le&s;s
your <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> would have ventur'd
&s;uch a Character of me from the
<HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> for fear of a Re&s;entment,
which would not be agreeable. Sure|ly
your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> has not read my
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> but has taken a Report
of them upon Tru&s;t, from &s;ome
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Noodle</HI>; or you could
never have been &s;o much mi&s;taken
about my De&s;ign in them.</P>
<P>I took my&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian
of the &s;ame Faith with the Fathers
of the Church; and, without Va|nity,
think, I have publi&s;h'd &s;ome
Tracts, in Defence of Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
equal, if not &s;uperior to any Thing
this Age has produced. I repeat|edly
al&s;o in my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es on Mira|cles,</HI>
to obviate the Prejudices of an
ignorant <HI>Clergy,</HI> made &s;olemn Pro|te&s;tations
of the Sincerity of my
De&s;ign, not to do Service to Infide|lity,
but to make Way for the De|mon&s;tration
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip
from Prophecy: But all the&s;e A&s;&s;eve|rations
of the Integrity of my Heart,
it &s;eems, &s;tand for nothing (and I
don't wonder at it) with the <HI>Clergy,</HI>
who in their Principles, their Oaths,
and Sub&s;criptions are &s;o accu&s;tom'd
to prevaricate with God and Man.
I &s;hall make no more &s;erious Pro|te&s;tations,
of my Faith, but expect
your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> &s;hould &s;oon publi&s;h a
Defence of your foul Charge a|gain&s;t
me, that I may &s;ee what
Skill you have in the impious and
bla&s;phemous Writings of an Infidel.</P>
<P>And if your <HI>railing Accu&s;ation</HI> be
not &s;oon followed with a Di&s;&s;erta|tation
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
of more Rea&s;on, I &s;hall in|&s;i&s;t
on a publick Reparation of the
Injury done to my Reputation by
your <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>&s;landerous</HI> Sermon;
and appeal to the wor&s;hipful <HI>Societies</HI>
for Reformation of Manners, whe|ther
it be not ju&s;t and rea&s;onable,
you &s;hould do one or the other.</P>
<P>Now I have laid hold of your
<HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> than whom I could not have
wi&s;h'd for an <HI>Adver&s;ary,</HI> that will
do me more Honour to overcome,
I will hold you fa&s;t; and you
mu&s;t expect to be teaz'd and in&s;ul|ted
from the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> if you enter
not the Li&s;ts again&s;t me.</P>
<P>A clear Stage, <HI>my Lord,</HI> and no
Favour. If you have the Sword of
the Spirit in your Hand, cut as
&s;harply as you can with it. I had
conceiv'd a great Opinion of your
Learning, and &s;hould have been a
little apprehen&s;ive of the Power of it;
if you had not in your Sermon be|tray'd
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
as great Weakne&s;s and Ig|norance,
as could be in a poor <HI>Cu|rat</HI>;
or you had never a&s;&s;erted that
the <HI>Greek</HI> Commentators adher'd
more &s;trictly to the litteral Sen&s;e of
the Holy Scriptures, as if you knew
not, that St. <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch,</HI>
and even <HI>Origen</HI> him&s;elf and others,
the greate&s;t <HI>Allegori&s;ts,</HI> if a Com|pari&s;on
may be made, were <HI>Com|mentators</HI>
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The &s;ooner your Lord&s;hip appears
from the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> the better, in as
much as you may po&s;&s;ibly prevent
my Publication of more <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI>
of this Kind. And that it may not
be long fir&s;t, I will accept of a
Di&s;&s;ertation from you, on any two
or three of the Miracles, I have
handled, as &s;ufficient for all. Take
your Choice of them: but don't I
be&s;eech you, touch the Miracle of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s driving the <HI>Buyers</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI>
out of the Temple, becau&s;e it is
a <HI>hot</HI> one, and may po&s;&s;ibly burn
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
your Fingers. The Miracles, that
I have mo&s;t ludicrou&s;ly and of
con&s;equence mo&s;t offen&s;ively hand|led,
are the two of this pre&s;ent
Di&s;cour&s;e. If you plea&s;e, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
let them be the ea&s;y and &s;hort
Task impo&s;ed on you. If you
can defend the Letter of the Stories
of the&s;e two Miracles, I'll quietly
give up the Re&s;t to you.</P>
<P>So heartily thanking your Lord|&s;hip
for the Favour done me, in
taking Notice of my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es on
Miracles,</HI> which &s;hall be turn'd to
good U&s;e and Advantage, I &s;ub|&s;cribe

<HEAD>A THIRD
DISCOURSE
On The
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_MY two former Di&s;cour&s;es
having met with a favoura|ble
Reception, I am encou|rag'd
to go on and publi&s;h
another; which, without any
more Preface, I enter upon,
by a Repetition of the three general
Heads, at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to be &s;poken to,
and they were,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="9">
I. To &s;how that the Miracles of heal|ing
all Manner of bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was ju&s;tly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> neither are
they &s;o much as a good Proof of his divine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove, that the literal Hi&s;tory of
many of the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as record|ed
by the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> does imply Ab&s;ur|dities,
Improbabilities, and Incredibilities;
con&s;equently they, either in whole or in
part, were never wrought, as they are
commonly believed now-a-days, but are
only related as prophetical and parabolical
Narratives of what would be my&s;teriou&s;ly
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider, what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Miracles, as to
a Te&s;timony and a Witne&s;s of his divine
Authority; and to &s;how that he could not
properly and ultimately refer to tho&s;e he
then wrought in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but to tho&s;e
My&s;tical ones, that he would do in the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> of which tho&s;e wrought in the Fle&s;h
are but meer Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>Tho' I have already &s;poken, what may
be thought &s;ufficient, to the fir&s;t of the&s;e
Heads; yet I have &s;everal Things &s;till, both
<PB N="3" REF="10">
from Rea&s;on and Authority, to add to it;
but having not here a convenient Place for
that Purpo&s;e, I defer it to a better Op|portunity;
and &s;o pa&s;s immediately to the
Re&s;umption of my</P>
<P>II. Second general Head, and that is, to
prove, that the literal Hi&s;tory of many of
the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as recorded by the
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> does imply Ab&s;urdities, Im|probabilities
and Incredibilities; con&s;e|quently
they, either in whole or in part
were never wrought, as it is commonly
believed now-a days, but are only related,
as prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what would be my&s;teriou&s;ly and more
wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e I have taken into Exa|mination
&s;ix of the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us, viz.</HI>
tho&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of his driving the Buyers and Sel|lers
out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of his exorci&s;ing the <HI>Devils</HI> out of
the Mad-men, and &s;ending them into
the Herd of Swine.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of his Transfiguration on the Mount.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of his healing a Woman, that had an
I&s;&s;ue of Blood, twelve Years.</P>
<P N="5">5. Of his curing a Woman, that had a
Spirit of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="4" REF="11">
6. Of his telling the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman
her Fortune of having had five Husbands,
and being then an Adultere&s;s with another
Man.</P>
<P>Whether I have not prov'd the Storys
of the&s;e Miracles, either in whole or in
part, to con&s;i&s;t of Ab&s;urdities, Improba|bilities,
and Incredibilities, according to
the Propo&s;ition before us, I leave my <HI>Rea|ders</HI>
to judge; and now will take in Hand</P>
<P N="7">7. A Seventh Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; <HI>viz.</HI>
that <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> Chap. xxi. <HI>Mark,</HI> Chap. xi.</NOTE> <HI>of his cur&s;ing the Figtree, for not
bearing Fruit out of Sea&s;on</HI>; which Miracle,
upon the bare mention of it, appears to be
&s;uch an ab&s;urd, fooli&s;h, and ridiculous, if
not malicious and ill-natured Act in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
that I que&s;tion, whether, for Folly and Ab|&s;urdity,
it can be equalled in any In&s;tance
of the Life of a reputed wi&s;e Man. The
Fathers, &s;uch as <HI>Origen,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> St.
<HI>John of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and others, have all &s;aid
as &s;mart Things, as the wittye&s;t Infidels
can, again&s;t the Letter of this Story. St.
<HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hoc factum, ni&s;i figuratum, &s;tultum invenitur. <HI>In Serm.</HI> lxxvii.</NOTE> very plainly &s;ays, that <HI>this
Fact in Je&s;us,</HI> upon Suppo&s;ition that it was
done, was <HI>a fooli&s;h one.</HI> If therefore I treat
<PB N="5" REF="12">
this Story a little more ludicrou&s;ly than
ordinary, and expo&s;e the Folly of the Fact
as well as of the modern Belief of it, I hope
their Authority and Example will plead
my Excu&s;e for it.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us</HI> was hungary, it &s;eems, and being
di&s;appointed of Figs, to the Satisfaction of
his Appetite, cur&s;ed the Figtree. Why &s;o
peevi&s;h and impatient? Our <HI>Divines,</HI>
when they plea&s;e, make <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the mo&s;t
patient, re&s;ign'd and ea&s;y under Sufferings,
Troubles and Di&s;appointments, of any
Man. If he really was &s;o, he could hard|ly
have been &s;o much out of Humour, for
want of a few Figs, to the Allay of his
Hunger. But to cur&s;e the Figtree upon it,
was as fooli&s;hly and pa&s;&s;ionately done,
as for another Man to throw the Chairs
and Stools about the Hou&s;e; becau&s;e his
Dinner is not ready at a critical Time, or
before it could be got ready for him.</P>
<P>But <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was hungry, &s;ome will &s;ay,
and the Di&s;appointment provoked him.
What if he was hungry? He &s;hould, as
he knew the Return of his Appetite,
have made a better and more certain
Provi&s;ion for it. Where was <HI>Judas</HI> his
Steward and Caterer with his Bag of
Victuals as well as Money? Poor Fore|ca&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="13" MS="y">
and Management among&s;t them, or
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> had nevet tru&s;ted to the uncertain
Fruits of a Figtree, which he e&s;py'd at a
Di&s;tance, for his Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>And if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was fru&s;trated of a long'd|for
Meal of Figs, what need he have &s;o
reveng'd the Di&s;appointment on the <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Nulla e&s;&s;et Ligni Culpa, quia Lignum &s;ine &s;en&s;u non habebat Culpam. Augu&s;tin <HI>in Serm.</HI> lxxxix.</NOTE> 
&s;en&s;le&s;s and faultle&s;s Tree? Was it, be|cau&s;e
he was forc'd to fa&s;t longer than u&s;ual
and expedient? not &s;o, I hope neither:
Could not Angels, if he was in a de&s;ert
Place, have admini&s;tred unto him? Or
could not he miraculou&s;ly have created
Bread for him&s;elf and his Company, as
he multiplied or increa&s;ed the Loaves for
his Thou&s;ands in the Wilderne&s;s? What
Occa&s;ion then for his being out of Hu|mour
for want of Food? If he was of Pow|er
to provide Bread for others on a &s;ud|den,
he might &s;ure have &s;upply'd his own
Nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;o have kept his Temper,
without breaking into a violent Fit of Pa&s;&s;i|on,
upon pre&s;ent Want and Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>But what is yet wor&s;e, <HI>the Time of
Figs was not yet,</HI> when Je&s;us look'd and
long'd for them. Did ever any one here
<PB N="7" REF="14">
or read of any Thing more <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Quaerit poma; nece&s;ciebat tempus nondum e&s;&s;e? quod Cultor Arboris &s;ciebat. Creator Arboris ne&s;ciebat? <HI>Augu&s;tini in Serm.</HI> lxxxix.</NOTE> unrea&s;on|able
than for a Man to expect Fruit out of
Sea&s;on? <HI>Je&s;us</HI> could not but know this be|fore
he came to the Tree, and if he had
had any Con&s;ideration, he would not have
expected Figs on it, much le&s;s, if he had
regarded his own Reputation, as a wi&s;e
Man, would he have &s;o re&s;ented the
Want of them. What, if a <HI>Yeoman</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI>
&s;hould go to look for <HI>Pipins</HI> in his Orchard
at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> (the &s;uppo&s;ed Time <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hoc ideo probamus, quia Pa&s;&s;ionis Domini Dies propinquabat, et &s;cimus quo tempore pa&s;&s;us &s;it. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ought for the&s;e Figs) and, becau&s;e
of a Di&s;appointment, cut down all his
Trees? What then would his Neighbours
make of him? Nothing le&s;s, than a <HI>Laugh|ing-Stock</HI>;
and if the Story got into our
publick News, he would be the Je&s;t and
Ridicule of Mankind. How <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;alv'd
his Credit upon this his wild Prank;
and prevented the Laughter of the <HI>Scribes</HI>
and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> upon it, I know not; but I can|not
think of this Part of the Letter of this
Story, without &s;miling at it at this Day;
and wonder our <HI>Divines</HI> are not laugh'd
<PB N="8" REF="15">
out of Countenance for reading it gravely,
and having <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in Admiration for it.</P>
<P>Again, I would gladly know, who&s;e Fig|tree
this was, and whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had any
legal Right to the Fruit, if haply he had
found any on it, or any Leave or Authority
to &s;mite it with a Cur&s;e for its Unfruitful|ne&s;s?
As to the Tree's being <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Pro|perty,
that could not be. For he was &s;o
far from being either Landlord or Tenant,
that it's &s;aid he had not where to lay his
Head. During the Time of his Mini&s;try,
he was but a Wanderer, like a Mendicant
Fryar, or an itenerant Preacher, and before
that Time was no better than a Journey|man
Carpenter (of who&s;e Workman&s;hip, I
wonder, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has no holy
Relicks, not &s;o much as a Three-footed-&s;tool,
or a Pair of Nutcrackers;) con&s;e|quently
he had no Hou&s;e nor Land of his
own by Law, much le&s;s any Figtree, and
lea&s;t of all <HI>this</HI> which he e&s;py'd at a di|&s;tance
in his Travels. How then had he
any Right to the Figs, if he had met with
any? I hope he ask'd Leave beforehand of
the Proprietor, or <HI>Infidels</HI> will &s;ay of him,
that if he had had an Opportunity he
would have been a <HI>Rob-Orchard.</HI> And if
he had no Right to the Fruit, much le&s;s to
&s;mite the Tree with a Cur&s;e; where was
<PB N="9" REF="16">
his Honour, <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Arbor non e&s;t ju&s;t&eacute; &s;iccata. <HI>Johan Hiero&s;ol in Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> his Ju&s;tice, his Good|ne&s;s,
and his Hone&s;ty in this Act? The <HI>E|vangeli&s;ts,</HI>
if they would have us to think,
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> did no wrong to any Man, &s;hould
have left us &s;omewhat upon Record, to Sa|tisfaction,
in this Ca&s;e; or <HI>Infidels,</HI> who
have here Scope for it, will think wor&s;e
of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than po&s;&s;ibly he may de&s;erve.
Whether <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> mode&s;tly &s;peaking, met
with any Blame or Reprimand from the
Proprietor, for his Act of Execration, none
can affirm or deny. But if any one &s;o
&s;pitefully and maliciou&s;ly &s;hould de&s;troy
almo&s;t any other Tree, whether fruitful
or not, of another Man's, in this Coun|try,
he would have good Luck, if he e|&s;caped
the Hou&s;e of Correction for it.</P>
<P>And what now have our <HI>Divines</HI> to &s;ay,
to all this Rea&s;oning again&s;t the Letter of
this Story? Nothing more than "That
the Act of cur&s;ing the Figtree, whe|ther
it be at this Di&s;tance of Time re|concileable
to Rea&s;on, Ju&s;tice and Pru|dence
or not, was a &s;upernatural Work,
above the Power of Nature or Art to
imitate, con&s;equently it was a Miracle,
and they will admire and adore <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="17">
for it." And to agree with them at
pre&s;ent, that it was a real Miracle, and
a &s;upernatural Event, yet I hope, they'll
acknowledge, that if <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>
 <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Si miraculum fuerat tantummodo commen|dandum, et non alquid prophetice figurandum, multo clementi&ugrave;s dominus et &s;ua mi&s;ericordia dig|ni&ugrave;s fecerat, Si quam aridam invenerit, viridem red|deret, &s;icut languentes &s;anavit. Tunc vero e con|trario, qua&s;i adver&s;us Regulam Clementiae &s;uae in|venit Arborem virentem, praeter tempus fructus nondum habentem, non tamen fructum agricolae ne|gantem, et aridam fecit. <HI>In Serm.</HI> lxxxix <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> &s;ays, had, in&s;tead of cur&s;ing the
Figtree, made a dry, dead and withered
one, immediately to bud, flouri&s;h and re|vive,
and in an In&s;tant to bring forth
ripe Fruits, out of Sea&s;on, it would have
plea&s;ed them much better. Such an In|&s;tance
of his Power had been an indi&s;|putable
Miracle: Such an In&s;tance of his
divine Power had carry'd Goodne&s;s along
with it, and none of the fore&s;aid Excep|tions
could have been made to it: Such
an In&s;tance of his Almighty Power, had
been a Demon&s;tration of his being Lord
of the Creation, and Author of the Fruits
of the Earth for the U&s;e of Man, in
their Sea&s;on, or he could not have pro|duced
them out of Sea&s;on. In &s;uch
<PB N="11" REF="18">
an In&s;tance of Power, his divine Care
and Providence again&s;t Hunger and Want
would have been vi&s;ible; and it would
have been an Admonition to us, to de|pend
daily upon him for the Comforts
and Nece&s;&s;aries of Life: Such an In&s;tance
of his Power would have been, as St.
<HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> &s;ays above, like his Miracles of
healing Di&s;ea&s;es, of making the Languid,
<HI>Sound</HI>; and the Feeble, <HI>Strong</HI>; and we
might more certainly have infer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d from
one with the other, that both were the
Operations of a good God. But this
In&s;tance of his cur&s;ing the Figtree in this
Fa&s;hion &s;poils the Credit, and &s;ullies the
Glory of his other Miracles. It is in its own
Nature of &s;uch a malevolent A&s;pect, that
its enough to make us &s;u&s;pect the Bene|ficence
of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his other Works, and to
que&s;tion whether there might not be &s;ome
latent Poy&s;on and diabolical De&s;ign under
the Colour of his fairer Pretences to Al|mighty
Power. It is &s;o like the malignant
Practices of <HI>Witches,</HI> who, as Stories go,

<P>But after all, it may be que&s;tioned, if

<HI>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for

as the Di&s;ciples pa&s;&s;ed by, they &s;aw the

was at lea&s;t the Day <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Quod &s;equenti die viderint exa|rui&s;&s;e ficum. <HI>Theophylact. in Locum Marci.</HI></NOTE> after the Cur&s;e
was utter'd, &s;o that there was certainly
four and twenty Hours for its withering;
and if it is &s;aid that the <HI>Tree dry'd up from

Trunk of it peri&s;h'd or was reduc'd to
<PB N="15" REF="22">
nothing; but only that the green Leaves
of the Whole, and of every Part of it,
were in a withering Condition: And might
not all this be done without a Miracle?
What if <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, that
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> being minded to impo&s;e on his Di&s;|ciples
and Followers, took a &s;ecret Op|portunity
beforehand to lay his Capen|ter's
Ax to the Root of this Tree, and &s;o
imperceptibly circumci&s;ed it, as that the
Leaves did, what they will do, wither in
a Night and a Day's Time. God forbid,
that I &s;hould think, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did &s;o; but as
to the Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a Fraud in an
Impo&s;tor, none can doubt of it.</P>
<P>I am &s;o far from thinking there was any
&s;uch Fraud in this &s;uppo&s;ed Miracle of <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI>
that I don't believe it was at all done
by him according to the Letter: And for
this I have not only a clear and intrin&s;ick
Proof from the Story it&s;elf; but the Autho|rity
of the Fathers. St <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> treating on
the Parable of the Figtree in <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Chap. xiii.</NOTE> St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> intimates, that what St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
and St. <HI>Mark</HI> write of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s cur&s;ing the
Figtree, is but <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Quid &s;ibi vult, quod in Evangelio &s;uo Dominus Fici Parabolam <HI>frequen|ter</HI> inducit: Habes enim alibi, quod ju&s;&s;u Domini Viriditas omnis hujus Ligni frondentis aurerit. <HI>In Loc. Lucae.</HI></NOTE> Part of the &s;ame Pa|rable.

&s;ays expre&s;sly enough, that the three <HI>E|vangeli&s;ts</HI>
write of one and the &s;ame Fig|tree,
con&s;equently parabolically, and that,
what St <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Mark</HI> write of
it, was no more a literal Tran&s;action, than
the Parable in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> Thanks to the&s;e
holy Fathers for their ridding us of the
Belief of the Letter of this Story, which
otherwi&s;e might have perplex'd us with its
Ab&s;urdities before urg'd. And to their
Opinion I de&s;ire it may be added and con|&s;idered,
whether it be not as rea&s;onable
in it&s;elf to take what the three <HI>Evange|li&s;ts</HI>
write of this Figtree, as Part of one
Story, as well as, what they write of the
<HI>Woman with her I&s;&s;ue of Blood,</HI> and of
<HI>Je&s;us's ca&s;ting the Devils out of the Mad|men,</HI>
and of other Miracles which are but
&s;everal Relations of the &s;ame Story, Para|ble
or Miracle. Neither is it any Argu|ment
for a literal Tran&s;action of this Mi|racle,
that, the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> &s;peak of it, as a
Thing done: For, as <HI>Origen</HI> &s;ays, there are
&s;ome Things &s;poken of in the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI>
as Facts, which were never tran&s;acted; &s;o
it is of the Nature of Prophecy (and our
<PB N="17" REF="24">
Saviour in his whole Life prophe&s;ied) to
&s;peak of Things to come, as if they were
already pa&s;t; becau&s;e &s;uch Prophecies are
not to be under&s;tood till after their Ac|compli&s;hment,
and then the Rea&s;on of
the U&s;e of the <HI>praeter,</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>fu|ture</HI>
Ten&s;e, in Prophecy, will be vi&s;ible.
But what, in my Opinion, is an ab&s;o|lute
Demon&s;tration, that there's no Truth
in the Letter of this Story, is, what our
Saviour adds, upon the Di&s;ciples wonder|ing
at the &s;udden withering of the Figtree,
&s;aying, <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> Chap. xxi. 21.</NOTE> <HI>that if they had Faith,</HI>
<HI>they &s;hould not only do what was done to the
Figtree</HI>; <HI>but &s;hould &s;ay to this Mountain,</HI>
(that was near him, I &s;uppo&s;e) <HI>be thou
removed and ca&s;t into the Sea, and it &s;hall
be done.</HI> But the&s;e Things were never lit|terally
done by them, con&s;equently <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
him&s;elf did not litterally cur&s;e the Figtree;
or the Di&s;ciples wanted Faith for the
doing the &s;aid Miracles, which is an Ab|&s;urdity
to &s;uppo&s;e; or <HI>Je&s;us</HI> talked idly
of a Promi&s;e to inve&s;t them with a Power.
they were never to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. But of
what ill Con&s;equence to Religion, either
of the&s;e Suppo&s;itions is, let the old Ob|jection

that Works of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> are all figurative

manife&s;t from his Act of cur&s;ing the Figtree,
as Men mu&s;t, <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Sed futurum aliquid Miraculo commenda&s;&s;e, multa &s;unt quae nos admoneant, nobi&s;&abque; per&s;uadeant, imo ab <HI>invitis</HI> exterqueant. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> <HI>whether, they will or

<PB N="19" REF="26">
who would que&s;tion, that this &s;uppo&s;ed

yet if he had liv'd in our Days, he
would have met with <HI>Divines,</HI> who, for all
the fore&s;aid Ab&s;urdities and their Cogen|cy
to drive us to Allegory, do adhere to
the Letter only, whether the Truth, Cre|dibility
and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it be defen|&s;ible
or not. But then to do Ju&s;tice to
St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion, he would have
met with others, who <HI>again&s;t their Wills,</HI>
interpret this Miracle figuratively, &s;uch
as Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> and Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> who
&s;ay, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> cur&s;ed the Figtree by way of
Type of the De&s;truction of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
State, which declined and wa&s;ted away
after the Similitude of this withering Tree.
But why then don't the&s;e <HI>Commentators</HI> al|legorically
interpret and apply other Mi|racles
of our Saviour? Becau&s;e they think
the Letter will &s;tand good and abide the
Te&s;t without an Allegory. And why do they
allegori&s;e this Miracle only? Becau&s;e of
the Dificulties and Ab&s;urdities of the Let|ter,
which they can't account for. And
are the&s;e Rea&s;ons good? No, certainly:
The <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> &s;hould have made the Di&s;|tinction
for them. They &s;hould have told
us, which Miracles are to be allegoris'd
and my&s;tically applied, and which are not;
or we are to allegori&s;e all or none at all.
<PB N="20" REF="27">
how came the&s;e modern Allegori&s;ts of this
Miracle to apply it as they do, and to
make it a my&s;tical Repre&s;entation of the
Ruin of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State? Did they take
up this Notion of their own Heads, or did
they borrow it of the Fathers? Why in all
Probability they took the Hint from the
Fathers; wherefore then don't they, what
none of them do, cite and acknowledge
their Authors for it? Becau&s;e, like Men
of Subtilty, they would be thought to
devi&s;e it of them&s;elves; for if they had quo|ted
the Fathers for it, the Fathers would
have oblig'd them, upon their Authority,
to allegori&s;e the re&s;t of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles,
in the way that I have interpreted &s;ome of
them; but this would not have agreed with
their Stomachs for many Rea&s;ons. No

or abide the Con&s;equence of allegori&s;ing
others al&s;o, which for their Intere&s;ts and

let them return again to the Letter of

<HI>Lo, the&s;e three Years come I &s;eeking Fruit on
this Figtree</HI>; as if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> came annually and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively for <HI>three Years</HI> together; but
according to the Original, it ought to be
<PB N="26" REF="33">
read, <HI>Lo, it is three Years and 1 now come,</HI>
or <HI>Lo, the three Years are now pa&s;t, and I
come.</HI> And here it is to be noted, that
whether we under&s;tand the Figtree, as a
Figure of the Church in particular, or of
Mankind in general; the my&s;tical Num|ber
of <HI>three Years</HI> will terminate about
the &s;ame Time, again&s;t the Evangelical
Sabbath, on which the Unfruitfulne&s;s of
the Church, or of Mandind, according to
the Fathers, is to have an End put to it.</P>
<P>And <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> when he came to the Fig|tree:
<HI>found nothing thereon but Leaves on|ly:</HI>
So <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> when he comes to his Church,
will find nothing in her but Leaves only.
And what is here meant by Leaves? Let
the Fathers, &s;uch as <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Inveniet infaecundam, foliis tantomodo ve&s;ti|tam, id e&s;t Verbis inanibus gloriantem, &s;ed fructi|bus vacuam, Operibus quippe bonis &s;terilem. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> St.

a vain and empty Appearance of Wi&s;|dom
and good Works, or the Words and
Letter of the Scriptures, which are the
Leaves of the Oracle, without any Figs of
<PB N="27" REF="34">
&s;piritual Interpretations of them. And whe|her
this ben't the Ca&s;e of the Church at
pre&s;ent, our <HI>Divines</HI> are to con&s;ider. The
Figs that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> may be &s;uppo&s;ed to look
for at his Coming, are not only the Fruits
of the Spirit mention'd by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> but
 <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Quaerens non Sen&s;iles Fructus &s;ed intellecti|lem ex Lege et Prophetis dulcem&abque; Faecundiratem. <HI>Cae&s;arii in Dialog.</HI> 40.</NOTE> <HI>&s;piritual Interpretations</HI> of the Scrip|tures,

<HI>my&s;tical Figs</HI>; becau&s;e, as ripe Figs are
&s;weet to the Palate of our Mouths, &s;o are
they no le&s;s delicious to the Soul of Man.</P>
<P>But <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>hungry</HI> after
Figs: &s;o will <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in Spirit <HI>hunger</HI> for
the my&s;tical Figs of his Church, that is,
as <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">E&s;uriit autem Je&s;us &s;emper in ju&s;tis, volens manducare Fructum Spiritus Sancti in eis. <HI>In Matt. Tract.</HI> XXX.</NOTE> rightly interprets, he will
earne&s;tly de&s;ire, like a Man that is hun|gry,
the Fruits of the Spirit in his Church,
which will be as grateful to him as Figs
can be to a Man naturally. To under&s;tand
this Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>Hunger</HI> literally, is
&s;uch a mean Circum&s;tance of Life, that
unle&s;s it be, what's next to impo&s;&s;ible, ne|ce&s;&s;arily
introductory to &s;ome noble Tran&s;|action,
<PB N="28" REF="35">
it's unfit to be remember'd of a
Saint in Hi&s;tory. <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> would
have di&s;dain'd to mention &s;uch a frivolous
Circum&s;tance in the Life of a Philo&s;opher
as <HI>this</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> But if we under&s;tand
this <HI>Hunger</HI> in <HI>Je&s;us</HI> my&s;tically, and fi|guratively
of his De&s;ires of the Fruits of
the Spirit in his Church, it is &s;ublime
and noble; and the Emblem confe&s;&s;edly
proper and instructive.</P>
<P>But <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;aid to come to the Fig|tree
at an un&s;ea&s;onable Time; <HI>For the
Time of Figs was not yet</HI>; which Expre&s;|&s;ion
has been the Perplexity of <HI>Commen|tators,</HI>
who with all their Wit and Saga|city
can't get well over it. I &s;hall not
mention here all or any of their pretend|ed
Solutions of this Difficulty; but let us
&s;ee whether we can't ea&s;ily and at once
unlo&s;e it. St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Words are <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
which are and have been
commonly tran&s;lated, <HI>for the Time of Figs
is not yet.</HI> But if we change the <HI>Point</HI>
into an <HI>Interrogation,</HI> and read thus, <HI>for
was it not the Time of Figs?</HI> the Difficulty
vani&s;hes as certainly, as that it is ab&s;urd
to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould come to his Fig|tree
and look for Fruit, when he could
not rea&s;onably expect any. This my So|lution
of this Difficulty certainly &s;erves
the Purpo&s;e of the my&s;tical Interpretati|on;
<PB N="29" REF="36">
and if it does not the litteral, I an|&s;wer,
we are not to heed the Letter, which
&s;eldom or never has any Sen&s;e or Truth
in it. But, by the by, it does the litte|ral
too, &s;ince there are no Grounds from
the Text to think, what has been the
common Opinion, that it was about the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;over that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> came to the
Figtree. If this my Solution of the Dif|ficulty
don't plea&s;e, I mu&s;t &s;ay with <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">Ad quem (Locum) intelligendum, ut opor|tet, expectandum e&s;&s;e Eliae, ut nonnu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">quam lo|quuntur Veteres de Locis ob&s;curi&s;&s;imis Adventum. <HI>In Exercitat.

off this my&s;tical Figtree, and pre&s;ent them
to the intellectual Ta&s;te of Mankind.
But, that my Solution is good, will appear
by what follows.</P>
<P>And <HI>Je&s;us</HI> finding Leaves only &s;ays,
in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> to the Figtree, <HI>Let no
Fruit grow on thee henceforward for e|ver</HI>;
which (with its parallel Place in St.
<HI>Mark</HI>) is in my Opinion a fal&s;e Tran&s;la|tion:
The Original is, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
and ought to be
<PB N="30" REF="37">
engli&s;hed, <HI>not as yet,</HI> or <HI>not untill now,</HI>
(that I came) <HI>again&s;t the</HI> (grand) <HI>Age</HI> (of
the Sabbath) has Fruit grown on thee. So
that the Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was to make
the Figtree of the Church fruitful; and
if her preceeding unfruitful State, which
(in St. <HI>Mark</HI>) <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;aid to cur&s;e, or ra|ther
to devote to Ruin, wa&s;ted away, it
was by Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But what Time of Day was it that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> came to the Figtree? It was in the
<HI>Morning.</HI> And of what Day? That is un|certain
as to the Letter, but according to
the my&s;tical Extent of the <HI>Three Years,</HI> whe|ther
we under&s;tand the Figtree as a Type
of the Church, or of all Mankind of all
Ages, it will be on the <HI>Morning</HI> of the
great Sabbath, when, upon the Appearance
of the Light of Chri&s;t, like the Ri&s;ing of
the Sun, an unfruitful and erroneous
Church mu&s;t needs wither away. And
the Di&s;ciples on the &s;aid <HI>Morning</HI> will,
as <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Oculis Spiritalibus viderunt My&s;terium fici &s;iccatae. <HI>Matt. Tract.</HI> xvi.</NOTE> &s;ays, with their intellectu|al
Eyes behold her wa&s;te with Admirati|on.
And then too, they under Chri&s;t
<HI>will do what is done to the Figtree,</HI> of the
Church, and <HI>remove Mountains</HI> of Anti|chri&s;tian
Power, that exalt them&s;elves a|gain&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="38">
him, as the Fathers interpret, and
I need not explain.</P>
<P>And what is meant by the Means, which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peaks of, to make the Figtree
of the Church fruitful on the Sabbatical
Year; <HI>the Year it is to be let alone to
bear Fruit in?</HI> There mu&s;t be <HI>digging a|bout
it,</HI> that is <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Effodientes Literam Legis. <HI>Cyril. Glaphyr.</HI> L. 1. P1.</NOTE> into the Earth of the
Letter of the Scriptures, and <HI>dunging</HI> of
it, that is calling <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">Mittitur ergo Cophinus Stercoris ad Radi|cem Arboris, quando pravitatis &s;uae Con&s;cientia tan|gitur memoria Cogitationis. <HI>Gregor. M. in Hom.</HI> xxxi.</NOTE> to Remembrance her

rationally &s;peaking will make the Church

<P>After this Fa&s;hion is the re&s;t of the Pa|rable
of the Figtree to be allegorized out
of the Fathers. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">Sed hoc &s;ignificat Ficulnea infructuo&s;a, quod Mulier inclinata; et hoc Ficulnea re&s;ervata, quod Mulier erecta.

and St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> make the&s;e two Stories
or Parables, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Figtree, and of
the Woman with her <HI>Spirit of Infirmity,</HI>
as they are blended together in St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
to be Figures of the &s;ame My&s;tery. The
<PB N="32" REF="39">
<HI>eighteen Years</HI> of the Woman's Infirmity
and the <HI>three Years</HI> of the Figtree's Un|fruitfulne&s;s,
they will have to be my&s;ti|cally
&s;ynchromical. And the Woman's <HI>In|curvity</HI>
to the Earth is, they &s;ay, &s;ignifi|cative
of the &s;ame Thing with the <HI>Un|fruitfulne&s;s</HI>
of the Figtree. And the <HI>E|rection</HI>
of the Woman on the Sabbath is of
the &s;ame Import with the <HI>Re&s;ervation</HI> of
the Tree for Fruitfulne&s;s on that Day.
And let any one &s;ee, if they don't admi|rally
agree, as I have interpreted the&s;e
two Parables.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Story of the Fig|tree,
I can't but adore the Providence of
God, that the Miracle has been hitherto
placed in the withering away of the Tree.
If the Miracle had been a plain Story of
a dead and wither'd Tree's being made
to bring forth Leaves and Fruit on a &s;ud|den;
this would have been &s;uch a mani|fe&s;tly
&s;upernatural Work, and &s;o agreea|ble
to modern Notioni&s;ts about Miracles,
that Mens Thoughts would have been &s;o
ab&s;orpt in the Con&s;ideration of the Letter,
as they would never have extended them
to the Contemplation of the My&s;tery. And
our Divines would have made &s;uch a Noi&s;e,
in our Ears of the Excellency and Mar|vellou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;uch a Miracle, as that
there would be no bearing of it. But
<PB N="33" REF="40">
But as the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> have in a good
Mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;s'd all mention of the af|ter
Fruitfulne&s;s of the Tree; and the Sto|ry,
by Mi&s;con&s;truction, is clog'd with the
fore&s;aid Difficulties and Ab&s;urdities, we
are of Nece&s;&s;ity driven to the &s;earch after
My&s;tery for good Sen&s;e and Truth in it.</P>
<P>And thus have I &s;poken enough to the
Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s cur&s;ing the Figtree,
which according to the Letter is a fooli&s;h
and ab&s;urd Story: But the my&s;tical
Operation, of which the Letter is a
Shadow, will be ravi&s;hing, marvelous
and &s;tupendous; and not only a Proof
of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Power and Pre&s;ence in his
Church, but a Demon&s;tration of his <HI>Me&s;&s;i|ah&s;hip,</HI>
in as much as an infinite Num|ber
of Prophecys upon Prophecys, will
thereupon be di&s;cern'd to be accom|pli&s;h'd,
or the Church can't bring forth
the Fruits of the Spirit, that is Spiritu|al
Interpretations of the Scriptures, like
ripe Figs. And &s;o I pa&s;s to an</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Eighth</HI> Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and that
is, <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot"><HI>John,</HI> Chap. v.</NOTE> "of his healing a Man of an
Infirmity, of thirty eight Years Dura|tion,
at the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> that had
five Porches, in which lay a great Mul|titude
of impotent Folk, blind, halt,
withered, waiting the troubling of the
<PB N="34" REF="41">
Waters, upon the De&s;cent of an An|gel,
who gave a Sanative Virtue to them,
to the curing of any one, be his Di&s;tem|per
of what kind &s;oever, who fir&s;t
&s;tept down into them."</P>
<P>This whole Story is what our Saviour
calls a <HI>Camel</HI> of a mon&s;trous Size for
Ab&s;urdities, Improbabilities and Incredi|bilities,
which our <HI>Divines,</HI> and their im|plicit
Followers of the&s;e la&s;t Ages, have
&s;wallowed without chewing; whil&s;t they
have been &s;training at <HI>Knats</HI> in Theology,
and he&s;itating at frivolous and indifferent
Things of the Church, of no Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracle in this Story,
which con&s;i&s;ted in his healing a Man, of
no body knows what <HI>Infirmity,</HI> there nei|ther
is nor can be proved any Thing &s;u|pernatural
in it, or there had been an
expre&s;s De&s;cription of the Di&s;ea&s;e, with|out
which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, there
was a miraculous Cure wrought. As far as
one may rea&s;onably gue&s;s, this Man's <HI>In|firmity</HI>
was more <HI>Lazyne&s;s</HI> than <HI>Lamene&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only &s;hamed him out of his
pretended Illne&s;s, by bidding him to take
up his Stool and walk off, and not lie a|ny
longer, like a lazy Lubbard and Di&s;|&s;embler,
among the Di&s;ea&s;ed, who were
real Objects of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion: Or,
<PB N="35" REF="42">
if he was no De&s;&s;embler, he was only
fancyfully &s;ick, and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by &s;ome proper
and &s;ea&s;onable Talk touch'd his Heart, to
his Relief; and &s;o, by the Help of his own
Imagination, he was cured, and went his
Way. This is the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> that can be
made of this <HI>infirm</HI> Man's Ca&s;e; and the
<HI>be&s;t</HI> that can be &s;aid of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Power
in the Cure of him, as will appear, by and
by, upon Examination into it. But the
other Parts of the Story of the healing
Virtue of the Waters, upon the De&s;cent
of an Angel into them, is not only void
of all good Foundation in Hi&s;tory, but
is a Contradiction to common Sen&s;e and
Rea&s;on, as will be manife&s;t after an In|quiry
into the Particulars of it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> was the beloved Di&s;ciple of
our Lord, and I hope he lov'd his Ma&s;ter;
or he was wor&s;e than an Heathen, who
loves tho&s;e who love him: But this Story,
and &s;ome others, that are peculiar to his
Go&s;pel, &s;uch as, of <HI>Je&s;us's telling the Sama|ritan
Woman her Fortune</HI>; of <HI>his healing
the blind Man with Eye-Salve made of
Clay and Spittle</HI>; Of <HI>his turning Water
into Wine for the U&s;e of Men, who had
before well drank</HI>; and of <HI>his rai&s;ing La|zarus
from the Dead,</HI> are enough to tempt
us to think, that he wilfully de&s;ign'd, ei|ther
to bla&s;t the Reputation of his Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="36" REF="43">
or to try how far the Credulity of Men,
who through blind Love were running a|pace
into Chri&s;tianity, might be impo&s;ed
on; or he had never related &s;uch idle Tales,
which, if the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> who &s;hould be the
philo&s;ophical Part of Mankind, had not
been amply hired into the Belief of them,
would certainly have been rejected with
Indignation and Scorn before now.</P>
<P>St. <HI>John</HI> wrote his Go&s;pel many Years
after the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI>: What then
&s;hould have been his peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s?
Certainly nothing more, than to add &s;ome
remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages of Life, to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Ho|nour,
which they had omitted; and to con|firm
the Truths which they had before re|ported
of him. But St. <HI>John</HI> is &s;o far from
doing this, that the Stories, he has parti|cularly
added, are not only derogatory
to the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but &s;poil his
Fame for a Worker of Miracles, which
the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> would rai&s;e him to.
By reading the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> one
would think, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was a Healer of
all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, however incurable
by Art and Nature, and that where-ever
he came, all the &s;ick and the maim'd
(excepting a few Infidels) were perfectly
cured by him. But this Story before us
will be like a Demon&s;tration, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
was no &s;uch Worker of Miracles and
<PB N="37" REF="44">
Healer of Di&s;ea&s;es, as he is commonly
believed to have been, and that he wrought
not near the Number of Cures, he is &s;up|po&s;ed
to have done, much le&s;s any great ones.
The be&s;t Conception that an impartial Rea|der
of the Go&s;pel can form of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> is, that
he was a tolerable good natural <HI>Orator,</HI> and
could hand&s;omely harangue the People
off hand, and was according to the Phi|lo&s;ophy
of the Times a good <HI>Cabali&s;t</HI>;
and his Admirers finding him endewed
with the Gift of Utterance, which was
thought by them more than human, they
fancy'd he mu&s;t have the Gift of healing
too, and would have him to exerci&s;e it;
which he did with Succe&s;s, upon the Fan|cies
and Imaginations of many, who mag|nified
his divine Power for it. And the
Apo&s;tles afterwards, to help forward the
Credulity and Delu&s;ion of the People,
amplified his Fame with extravagant A&s;|&s;ertions
and &s;trange Stories of Miracles,
pa&s;&s;ing the Belief of con&s;iderate and wi&s;e
Men. Whether this Repre&s;entation of the
Ca&s;e, according to the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Go&s;|pels,
be fal&s;e and improbable, let my
<HI>Readers</HI> judge by the Story before us,
which I come now to di&s;&s;ect, and make
a particular Examination into the &s;everal
Parts of it. Accordingly it is to be ob|&s;erv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that this Story of the <HI>Pool</HI> of
<HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered from
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Cure of an infirm Man at it, has
no good Foundation in Hi&s;tory: It merits
no Man's Credit, nor will any rea&s;onable
Per&s;on give any heed to it. St. <HI>John</HI> is
the only Author that has made any
mention of this Story; and tho' his Au|thority
may be good, and better than an|other
Man's in Relation to the Words
and Actions of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in as much as he
was mo&s;t familiar and conver&s;ant with
him; yet, for foreign Matters, that have
no immediate Re&s;pect to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Life, he's
no more to be regarded than another <HI>Hi&s;to|rian,</HI>
who, if he palm upon his <HI>Readers</HI>
an improbable Tale of &s;en&s;le&s;s and ab&s;urd
Circum&s;tances, will have his Authority
que&s;tioned, and his Story pry'd into by
the Rules of <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> and rejected or
received as it is found worthy of Be|lief
and Credit. If there had been any
Truth in this Story before us, I cannot
think but <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Writers, it is &s;o remarkable, peculiar and
a&s;toni&s;hing an In&s;tance of the Angelical
Care and Love to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
would have &s;poken of it: But I don't
find they have; or our modern <HI>Commen|tators</HI>
would have refer'd to them, as to
a Te&s;timony of the Credibility of the
<PB N="39" REF="46">
Go&s;pel-Hi&s;tory. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has profe&s;&s;ed|ly
written the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Nation, in which he &s;eems to omit no|thing
that makes for the Honour of his
Country, or for the Manife&s;tation of the
Providence of God over it. He tells us
of the Conver&s;ation of Angels with the
Patriarchs and Prophets, and intermixes
Extra-Scriptural Traditions, as he thought
them fit to be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity.
How came he then and all other <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Writers to forget this Story of the Pool
of <HI>Bethe&s;da?</HI> I think, we may as well
&s;uppo&s;e that a Writer of the natural Hi|&s;tory
of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> would neglect to
&s;peak of the medicinal Waters of <HI>Bath,</HI>
as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;hould omit that Story, which,
if true, was a &s;ingular Proof of God's di|&s;tingui&s;hing
Care of his peculiar People,
or an Angel had never been frequently,
as we &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ent to this Relief of the
Di&s;ea&s;ed among&s;t them. Is then St. <HI>John</HI>'s
&s;ingle Authority enough to convey this
Story down to us? Some may &s;ay, that
there are &s;everal Prodigies, as well as po|litical
Events of ancient Times, that, tho'
they are reported but by one Hi&s;torian,
meet with Credit; and why may not St.
<HI>John</HI>'s Te&s;timony be equal to another
Writer's? I grant it; and tho' it is hardly
probable but that this Story, if true, before
<PB N="40" REF="47">
us, mu&s;t have had the Fortune to be told
by others; yet St. <HI>John</HI>'s &s;ingle Authori|ty
&s;hall pa&s;s &s;ooner than another Man's,
if the Matter be in it&s;elf credible and well
circum&s;tanc'd. But were it is blindly Im|perfectly
and with mon&s;trou&s;ly incredible
Circum&s;tances related, like this before us,
it ought to be rejected. Which brings me,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To ask, what was the true
Occa&s;ion of the Angels De&s;cent into this
Pool? Was it to wa&s;h and bath him&s;elf?
Or, was it to impart an healing Quality
to the Waters for &s;ome one di&s;ea&s;ed Per|&s;on?
The Rea&s;on, that I ask the fir&s;t of
the&s;e two Que&s;tions, is, becau&s;e &s;ome
ancient Readings of v. 4. &s;ay <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Vid, Milli. Nov. Te&s;t. <HI>In Loc.</HI></NOTE> the
Angel <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>was wa&s;hed,</HI> which &s;uppo&s;es
&s;ome bodily Defilement or Heat contract|ed
in the Caele&s;tial Regions, that want|ed
Refrigeration or Purgation in the&s;e
Waters: But how ab&s;urd &s;uch a Thought
is, needs no Proof. To impart then com|pa&s;&s;ionately
an healing Power to the Wa|ters
for the Benefit of the Di&s;ea&s;ed was
the &s;ole De&s;ign of the Angel's De&s;cent in|to
them. And God forbid, that any &s;hould
philo&s;ophically debate the Matter, and
enquire how naturally the Waters deriv'd
that Virtue from the Angel's corporal
<PB N="41" REF="48">
Pre&s;ence. The Thing was providential
and miraculous, our <HI>Divines</HI> will &s;ay, and
&s;o let it pa&s;s. But I may fairly ask, why
one di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;on only at a Time reap'd
the Benefit? Or why the whole Num|ber
of impotent Folks were not at once
healed? I have a notable An&s;wer pre|&s;ently
to be given to the&s;e Que&s;tions; but
I am afraid beforehand, our <HI>Divines</HI> will
not approve of it: Therefore they are to give
one of their own, and make the Matter
con&s;i&s;tent with the Goodne&s;s and Wi&s;dom
of God; or the &s;aid Que&s;tions &s;poil the
Credit of the Story, and make an idle
and ridiculous Romance of it. And when
their Hands are in, to make, what is im|po&s;&s;ible,
a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to the
&s;aid Que&s;tions; I wi&s;h, that, for the &s;ake
of <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> they would determine, whe|ther
the Angel de&s;cended with his Head
or his Heels foremo&s;t, or whether he might
not come &s;wauping upon his Brea&s;t into
the Waters, like a Goo&s;e into a Hor&s;e|pond.
But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> How often in the Week, the
Month or the Year did the Angel
vouch&s;afe his De&s;cent into the Pool?
And for how many Ages before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Advent, and why not &s;ince and even <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Quare modo non movetur Aqua? St. <HI>Am|bro&s;. de Sacrament. Lib. C.</HI> 2.</NOTE> 
<PB N="42" REF="49">
<HI>now,</HI> was this Gracious and Angelical Fa|vour
granted? St. <HI>John</HI> &s;hould have been
particular as to the&s;e Points, which he could
not but know Philo&s;ophers would be cu|rious
to enquire about. If it was but once
in the Year, as St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>In Serm. contra Eberictatem.</HI></NOTE> hints,
little Thanks are due to him for his Cour|te&s;y.
One would think &s;ometimes, that
his De&s;cent was frequent; or &s;uch a Mul|titude
of impotent Folk, variou&s;ly di&s;|order'd
had never attended on it. And
again at other Times, one would think
that his De&s;cent was &s;eldom, or the Di&s;|ea&s;ed
as fa&s;t as they came, which could
not be fa&s;ter than the Angel could dabble
him&s;elf in the Waters, had been charita|bly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with re&s;tor'd Health. Here
then is a Defect in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Story, and a
<HI>Block,</HI> at which wi&s;e and con&s;iderate Free-Thinkers
will &s;tumble. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> How came it to pa&s;s, that
there was not better Care taken, either
by the Providence of God, or of the
Civil Magi&s;trates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> about
the Di&s;po&s;al of the Angelical Favour to
this or that poor Man, according to his
Nece&s;&s;ities or De&s;erts: But that he, who
<PB N="43" REF="50">
could fortunately catch the Favour, was
to have it. Ju&s;t as he who runs fa&s;te&s;t
obtains the Prize: So here the Di&s;ea&s;ed,
who was mo&s;t nimble and watchful of
the Angel's De&s;cent, and could fir&s;t plunge
him&s;elf into the Pool, carried off the Gift
of Sanation. An odd and a merry Way of
conferring a divine Mercy. And one would
think that the Angels of God did this
for their own Diver&s;ion, more than to
do good to Mankind, Ju&s;t as &s;ome
throw a Bone among a Kennel of Hounds,
for the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them quarrel
for it; or as others ca&s;t a Piece of Mo|ney
among a Company of Boys for the
Sport of &s;eeing them &s;cramble for it: So
was the Pa&s;time of the Angels here. It
was the Opinion of &s;ome Heathens, that
<HI>Homines &s;unt Lu&s;us Deorum,</HI> the Gods
&s;port them&s;elves with the Mi&s;eries of
Mankind; but I never thought, before
I con&s;idered this Story, that the <HI>An|gels</HI>
of the God of the <HI>Jews</HI> did &s;o too.
But if they delighted in it, rare &s;port
it was to them, as could be to a <HI>Town-Mobb.</HI>
For as the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Wretches were not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be of &s;uch a polite Conver&s;ation, as in
Complai&s;ance to give place to their bet|ters,
or in Compa&s;&s;ion to make way
for the mo&s;t mi&s;erable; but upon the Sight
<PB N="44" REF="51">
or Sound of the Angel's Fall into the Pool,
would without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons &s;trive who
&s;hould be fir&s;t: So tho&s;e who were behind
and unlikely to be cured, would like an
unciviliz'd <HI>Rabble,</HI> pu&s;h and pre&s;s all
before them into it. What a Number
then, of &s;ome hundreds perhaps, of poor
Creatures were at once tumbled into the
Waters to the Diver&s;ion of the City Mob,
as well as of God's Angels? And if one
aro&s;e out of it, with the Cure of his Di&s;|ea&s;e,
the re&s;t came forth like drown'd <HI>Rats,</HI>
to the Laughter of the fore&s;aid Specta|tors;
and it was well if there was not &s;ome|times
more Mi&s;chief done, than the heal|ing
of <HI>one</HI> could be of Advantage, to tho&s;e
People. Believe then this Part of the Story,
let him that can. If any Angel was con|cern'd
in this Work, it was an Angel of
<HI>Satan</HI> who delights in Mi&s;chief; and if
he healed <HI>one</HI> upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, he
did it by way of Bait, to draw others
into Danger of Life and Limb. But as
our <HI>Divines</HI> will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, bear the
Thoughts of it's being a bad Angel; &s;o
I leave them to con&s;ider upon our Rea|&s;onings,
whether it was credible that ei|ther
a good or a bad Angel was concern|ed,
and de&s;ire them to remember to give
me a better Rea&s;on, why but <HI>one</HI> at a
Time was healed.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52">
If any Pool or Ci&s;tern of Water about
this City of <HI>London</HI> was &s;o ble&s;&s;ed with the
De&s;cent of an Angel to &s;uch an End, the
Magi&s;trates, &s;uch is their Wi&s;dom, would, if
God did not direct, take care of the pru|dent
Di&s;po&s;al of the Mercy to the be&s;t
Advantage of the Di&s;ea&s;ed. And if they
&s;old it to an infirm <HI>Lord</HI> or <HI>Merchant,</HI> who
could give for it mo&s;t Money, to be di&s;tri|buted
among other Poor and di&s;tre&s;s'd Peo|ple,
would it not be wi&s;ely done of them?
To &s;uppo&s;e they would leave the Ange|lick
Favour to the Struggle of a Multitude,
is ab&s;urd and incredible. And why then
&s;hould we think otherwi&s;e of the Magi|&s;trates
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>? Away then with
the Letter of this Story! And if this be
not enough to confute it. Then,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Let us con&s;ider, to its farther
Confutation, who and what were the
impotent Folk, that lay in the Porches of
<HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> waiting the Troubling of the
Waters. St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays they were <HI>Blind,</HI>
<HI>Halt, Withered,</HI> and as &s;ome Manu&s;cripts
 <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Vid. Milli. Nov. Te&s;t. <HI>In Loc.</HI></NOTE> have it, <HI>Paralyticks.</HI> And what did
any of the&s;e there? How could any of
them be &s;uppo&s;ed to be nimble enough of
Foot to &s;tep down fir&s;t into the Waters,
and carry off the Prize of Sanation, be|fore
<PB N="46" REF="53" MS="y">
many others of various Di&s;tempers?
Tho' the troubled Waters might be of
&s;uch medicinal Force as to heal a Man of
what&s;oever Di&s;ea&s;e he had; yet none of
the fore&s;aid Per&s;ons for want of good Feet
and Eyes could expect the Benefit of it.
Tho' the Ears of the Blind might &s;erve
him to hear, when the Angel plump't
like a Stone into the Waters, yet through
want of Sight for the guidance of his
Steps, he would by others be jo&s;tled out
of the right Way down into them. And
if the Lame had good Eyes to di&s;cern the
the De&s;cent of the Angel, yet Feet were
all in all to this Purpo&s;e: Con&s;equently
the&s;e impotent Folk, &s;pecified by St. <HI>John,</HI>
might as well have &s;lay'd at Home, as re|&s;orted
to <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> for Cure. I know not
what Fools the Di&s;ea&s;ed of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> of
old might be, but if there was &s;uch a Prize
of Health to be &s;trove for, by the Di&s;tem|pered
of this City, I appeal to all Men
of common Sen&s;e, whether the <HI>Blind,</HI> the
<HI>Lame,</HI> the <HI>withered</HI> and <HI>Paralyticks</HI> would
offer to put in for it. St. <HI>John</HI> then for|got
him&s;elf, or el&s;e blundered egregiou&s;ly,
or put the Banter upon us, to try how
far an ab&s;urd Tale would pa&s;s upon the
World with Credit. There might be, if
there was any litteral Sen&s;e in the Story,
many of other Di&s;tempers, but there could
<PB N="47" REF="54">
be neither <HI>blind, halt</HI> nor <HI>withered,</HI> with|out
<HI>&s;uch an Ab&s;urdity,</HI> as ab&s;olutely di&s;|parages
the Story, bla&s;ts the Credit of
the <HI>Relator,</HI> or rather brings to mind the
A&s;&s;ertion of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> that the Letter
of the <HI>New</HI> as well as the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>
lies abominably. If what I have here
&s;aid does not overthrow the Letter of this
Story; Then what I have,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> To add, will do it more effect|tually,
and that is, of the <HI>certain Man, that
had an Infirmity thirty and eight Years,</HI> and
lay at this Pool for an Opportunity to be
cured of it. Tho' the&s;e <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI>
Years are, in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation prae|dicated
of this Man's Infirmity, yet more
truely, according to the Original, are they
&s;poken of the Time he lay there; and the
Fathers &s;o under&s;tood St. <HI>John</HI>'s Words.
What this Man's Infirmity was, we are
uncertain: For <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Infirmity</HI>
is a general Name of all Di&s;termpers, and
may be equally apply'd to one as well as to
another: Whereupon, tho' we can't certain|ly
&s;ay from this Man's Infirmity, that he
was a Fool to lay there &s;o long, expecting
that Cure, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for
him to obtain; yet what he &s;ays to our
Saviour, <HI>I have no Man, when the Waters
are troubled to put me into the Pool, but
while I am coming, another &s;teppeth down</HI><PB N="48" REF="55" MS="y">
<HI>before me,</HI> does imply his Folly &s;ufficient|ly,
or rather the Incredibility of the whole
Story. What then did this <HI>infirm</HI> Man at
this Pool, if he had neither Legs of his
own good enough, nor a Friend to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him, in the Attainment of Sanarion? Was
he not a Fool, if it was po&s;&s;ible for any
to be &s;o great a one, for his Patience?
Would it not have been as wi&s;ely done
of him to wait, in the Fields &s;o long, the
Falling of the Sky, that he might catch
Larks? The Fathers &s;ay, this Man's <HI>In|firmity</HI>
was the <HI>Pal&s;y</HI>; but whether they
&s;aid &s;o for the Sake of the My&s;tery, or
to expo&s;e the Letter, I know not. But that
Di&s;temper after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI> Years
Duration, and Increa&s;e, if it was more
curable than another at fir&s;t, had in that
time undoubtedly &s;o weakened and render'd
him uncapable to &s;truggle with others
for this Relief, that it is without Sen&s;e and
Rea&s;on to think he &s;hould wait &s;o long for
it. Our <HI>Divines,</HI> if they &s;o plea&s;e, may
commend this Man for his Patience, but
after a few Years, or rather a few Days
Experience, another Man would have
been convinc'd of the Folly and Vanity
of his Hopes, and returned Home. If
he could not put in for this Benefit, with
Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s in his more youthful
Days, when the Di&s;temper was young too,
<PB N="49" REF="56" MS="y">
much le&s;s Rea&s;on had he to hope for it
in his old Age, after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight Years</HI>
Affliction, unle&s;s he dream'd of, what was
not to be imagined, an Opportunity, with|out
Mole&s;tation and Competition, to go
off with it. Whatever then our <HI>Divines</HI>
may think of this Man and his Patience,
I will not believe there ever was &s;uch a
Fool; and for this Rea&s;on will not &s;up|po&s;e
St. <HI>John</HI> could litterally &s;o ro|mance,
unle&s;s he meant to bambouzle
Mankind into the Belief of the greate&s;t
Ab&s;urdity. A Man that Lies with a Grace
to deceive others, makes his Story &s;o
hang together, as to carry the Face and
Appearance of Truth along with it;
which this of St. <HI>John,</HI> that for many
Ages has been &s;wallowed, for the Rea&s;on
before us, has not. But what is the wor&s;t
of all again&s;t this Story is,</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly</HI> That which follows, and
ab&s;olutely de&s;troys the Fame and Credit
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for a Worker of Miracles. <HI>And</HI>
V. 1, 2, 3, <HI>Je&s;us went up to Jeru&s;alem,
where there was by the Sheep-Market, a
Pool, called Bethe&s;da, having five Porches,
in which lay a great Multitude of impo|tent
Folk, blind, halt, withered.</HI> Why then
did not <HI>Je&s;us</HI> heal them? Here was a
rare Opportunity for the Di&s;play of his
Healing and Almighty Power; and why
<PB N="50" REF="57">
did he not exerci&s;e it, to the Relief of
that Multitude of impotent Folk? If
he could not cure them, there's an End
of his Power of Miracles; and if he
would not, it was want of Mercy and
Compa&s;&s;ion in him. Which way &s;oever
we take this Ca&s;e, it turns to the Di&s;ho|nour
of the Holy <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> What then was
the Rea&s;on, that of &s;o great a Multitude
of di&s;ea&s;ed People, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> exerted his
Power, and extended his Mercy, on only
<HI>one</HI> poor Paralytick? St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Tot jacebant et unus curatus, cum po&s;&s;et uno Verbo omnes erigere. Quid ergo intelligendum e&s;t, ni&s;i quia Pote&s;tas et Bonitas illa magis agebat, <HI>&amp;c. In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> 
puts this Que&s;tion and Objection into
my Mouth; and tho' neither He nor I
&s;tart it for the Service of Infidelity, but
to make Way for the My&s;tery; yet I
know not why <HI>Infidels,</HI> may not make U&s;e
of it, till Mini&s;ters of the Letter can give
a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer and Solution to it.</P>
<P>The Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Matthew, Mark,</HI> and
<HI>Luke,</HI> tell &s;uch Stories of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s healing
Power, as would incline us to think he
cured all where-ever he came. He <HI>heal'd,</HI>
they &s;ay, <HI>all Manner</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es among
the People, and they make mention of
particular Times and Places, where all
the Di&s;ea&s;ed were healed by him, which
<PB N="51" REF="58">
A&s;&s;ertions imply, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s healing Pow|er
was mo&s;t exten&s;ive and (excepting to
an hard-hearted and unbelieving <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI>
now and then) univer&s;al; &s;o far that it
might be que&s;tion'd, whether any died,
during the Time of his Mini&s;try, in
the Places where he came: And our
<HI>Divines</HI> have &s;o harangued on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Mi|racles,
as would confirm us in &s;uch an
Opinion: But this Story in St. <HI>John</HI>
confutes and confounds all. St. <HI>John</HI> in
no Place of his Go&s;pel talks of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
healing of many, nor of all manner of
Di&s;ea&s;es, much le&s;s of all that were Di&s;|ea&s;ed;
which, if it be not like a Contra|diction
to the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> is &s;ome Di|minution
of their Authority, and enough to
make us &s;u&s;pect, that they &s;tretch'd much
in prai&s;e of their Ma&s;ter, and &s;aid more
to his Honour than was &s;trictly true. But
this Place before us is a flat Contradicti|on
to them, and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed
to heal many in any Place, much
le&s;s all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, or he had never
let &s;uch a Multitude of poor Wretches
pa&s;s without the Exerci&s;e of his Pow|er
and Pity on them. Some good Rea|&s;on
then mu&s;t be given for <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Con|duct
here, and &s;uch a one as will adju&s;t
it to the Reports of the other Evange|li&s;ts;
or <HI>Infidels</HI> will think, that either
<PB N="52" REF="59">
they romanc'd for the Honour of their
Ma&s;ter, or that St. <HI>John</HI> in Spite told
this Story to the Degradation of him.
I can conceive no better of this Mat|ter
according to the Letter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI> very remark|ably
&s;ays, <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">Defence of Chri&s;tianity, P. 415.</NOTE> <HI>that Je&s;us where-ever
he went, healed all that came to home with|out
Di&s;tinction, the important, halt, wither|ed.</HI>
He certainly had this Text of St.
<HI>John</HI> in his Eye, when he &s;aid &s;o, becau&s;e
<HI>Impotent, Halt, Withered,</HI> are only men|tion'd
here, where Je&s;us cured <HI>none</HI> of
them: Whereupon if his <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> had
made but a marginal Reference to this
Text, it would have been the be&s;t Je&s;t and
Banter, with a, Sneer, that ever was put
upon <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Power of Miracles:
As it is, it's a very good one, and I
de&s;ire my Readers to take Notice of
it, that his Lord&s;hip may not lo&s;e the
Credit and Prai&s;e of it. It's &s;or &s;uch Cir|cum&s;pection
of Thought, Exactne&s;s of
Expre&s;&s;ion, and Acutene&s;s of Wit, that
I admire that <HI>Prelate,</HI> and mu&s;t needs &s;ay
of him, whether he ever be tran&s;lated to
<HI>Canterbury</HI> or <HI>York,</HI> or not, that he's an
<HI>arch</HI> Bi&s;hop.
<PB N="53" REF="60">
But to return and go on. The Con|duct
of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to all Appearance, is not
only blameable, his Power of healing di&s;|putable,
and his Mercy indefen&s;ible, for
that he cured but <HI>one</HI> infirm Man out of
a Multitude, at <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> but,</P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> and la&s;tly, it may rea&s;onably be
que&s;tioned, whether he wrought any Mi|racle
in the healing of this <HI>one</HI> Man.
Miracles (to &s;ay nothing of the ridicu|lous
Di&s;tinction between divine and dia|bolical
ones) are Works done out of the
Cour&s;e of Nature, and beyond the Imi|tation
of human Art of Power. Now
whether the Cure of this infirm Man can
be brought under this Definition of a Mi|racle,
may be doubted. What this Man's
<HI>Infirmity,</HI> which is a general Name for
all Di&s;tempers, was, we know not. How
then can we &s;ay he was miraculou&s;ly
cured, unle&s;s, we knew his Di&s;ea&s;e to be
incurable by Art, which none can affirm?
The wor&s;t that we know of this Man's
Ca&s;e, is, that it was of a long Conti|nuance,
no le&s;s than of <HI>eight</HI> and <HI>thirty</HI>
Years: And the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI> and
others in their florid Harangues of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Works, make the Cure of &s;uch Chroni|cal
Di&s;ea&s;es to be miraculous: But why
&s;o? Many In&s;tances may be given of In|firmities
of human Nature, of a long Du|ration,
<PB N="54" REF="61">
which in Time, and e&s;pecially in old
Age, wear off. If &s;uch Infirmites don't
occur to the Memory of our <HI>Divines,</HI> I
could put them in Mind of them. And
who knows but this was the Ca&s;e of
this impotent Man, who&s;e Infirmity <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
ob&s;erving to be wearing off, bid him to
be gone, and take up his Couch, for he
would &s;oon be made whole.</P>
<P>The Fathers indeed call this Man's
Infirmity the <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> which in truth is ge|nerally
wor&s;e than better by Time, and
after <HI>thirty</HI> and <HI>eight</HI> Years, mu&s;t needs
be very deplorable, and incurable with|out
a Miracle. But why do they call
it the Pal&s;y? They have no Authority for
it from the Text, without which, as our
litteral <HI>Doctors</HI> will not &s;ub&s;cribe to their
Opinions in other Ca&s;es; &s;o why &s;hould
I here? In &s;hort, the Fathers had never
call'd it the <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> but for the &s;ake of the
My&s;tery; and I am not bound to own
<HI>that</HI> to have been the Di&s;temper, any
more than it was want of Legs; for that
would be making of Miracles for <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
without Rea&s;on and Authority.</P>
<P>If <HI>Je&s;us</HI> here had healed the whole
<HI>Multitude of impotent Folk</HI>; without En|quiry
what Numbers there might be of
them, I &s;hould have believed that he
wrought there many great Miracles, in as
<PB N="55" REF="62">
much as in &s;uch a great Multitude, there
mu&s;t needs, in all Probability, be &s;ome
incurable by Art or Nature: But &s;ince he
cured only this <HI>one</HI> Man, it affords Mat|ter

<HI>mo&s;t</HI> or the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> di&s;ea&s;ed among&s;t them.
Our <HI>Divines,</HI> for the &s;ake of the Miracle,
may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e him to be the mo&s;t
grieviou&s;ly afflicted of any; but <HI>Infidels,</HI>
on the other hand, will &s;ay, not &s;o:
but with their Cavils will urge that this
infirm Man was either a Di&s;&s;embler, whom
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hamed out of his pretended Di&s;|ea&s;e,
or that he was only hippi&s;h, and fan|cyfully
more than really di&s;temper'd of
a long Time, whom <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by &s;uitable Ex|hortations
and Admonitions, working up|on
his Imagination, per&s;uaded into a
Belief of his Cure, and bid him to walk
off. Certain it is, that <HI>Infidels</HI> will &s;ay,
it was not a Power of Miracles in <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
which heal'd him, or he had u&s;ed it then
and there for the Sanation of others al&s;o.</P>
<P>And thus have I fini&s;h'd my Invective
again&s;t the Letter of this Story; which,
if any are offended at, they enjoy, what
is the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Thing in the World,
the &s;ame Liberty to write for the Letter,

And how is Mankind to be cured of

<HI>to ari&s;e and take up his bed and walk,</HI> that

Vi&s;ions and of dreaming Dreams; con|&s;equently
at that Time, as the ancient <HI>Jews</HI>
and Fathers a&s;&s;ert, Mankind will be cured of
this Infirmity at the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">
And this too is the <HI>certain Sea&s;on, that
the Angel will de&s;cend and trouble the
Waters.</HI> By Angel is here meant <NOTE N="58" PLACE="foot">Turbabat Angelus,&mdash;dictus e&s;t Domi|nus magni con&s;ilii Angelus. <HI>Augu&s;tin in Serm.</HI> cxxv <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE>

of all Nations. But how will the De|&s;cent
of the Spirit of Truth, like an An|gel,
trouble the&s;e Waters, that is, give
any Mole&s;tations and Di&s;turbance to
the People? Is there not a Mi&s;take in
the Oracle? If the <HI>Clergy</HI> will be but
greater Lovers of Truth than of their In|tere&s;ts;
if they, who &s;hould be Teachers
of Forbearance of one another in Love,
will but keep their Temper, there would
be found a mi&s;take in it. But alas!</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> as is intimated,
&s;eem to have been mov'd with Indignati|on
at the Cure of the infirm Man, &s;ay|ing
to him, v. 10. <HI>it is the Sabbath,
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy
Bed</HI>; which litterally could not be true.
The <HI>Jews</HI> were not &s;uch preci&s;e Ob&s;er|vers
of the Sabbath; nor <HI>&s;o &s;tupid and
fooli&s;h,</HI> as St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> <NOTE N="60" PLACE="foot">Sabbatum e&s;t et Grabatum non licet tol|lere. Quid &s;tupidius aut inertius e&s;&s;e pote&s;t <HI>In Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays, as to

think the taking up and carrying a Stool
to be a Breach of it. But my&s;tically, it
is to be fear'd, this will be mo&s;t true,
and that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who would be <HI>Jews</HI>
inwardly, and the Circumci&s;ion in Spi|rit,
will be bitter Enemies to Man's
Exaltation of his Couch of the Letter of
the Scriptures on or again&s;t the Evangeli|cal

an <HI>unlawful</HI> Work; becau&s;e it will bring
to them Shame, Di&s;honour and Lo&s;s of
Intere&s;ts along with it.</P>
<P>After this Manner is every other Cir|cum&s;tance
of this Story to be allegori|cally
apply'd out of the Fathers. The
Moral or My&s;tery of the whole, in &s;hort,
is this, that at the Perfection of Time,
&s;ignified by the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI>
the End of <HI>thirty eight Years,</HI> the Spirit
of Truth will de&s;cend on Mankind, to
their Illumination in Prophecy, and to the
healing of their <HI>Errors,</HI> call'd <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>;
which is admirably repre&s;ented by the
Parable before us, that according to the
Letter has neither Rea&s;on nor common
Sen&s;e in it.</P>
<P>And thus have I &s;poken to <HI>eight</HI> of the
Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; and whether I have
not &s;hew'd them, in whole or Part, ac|cording
to the Propo&s;ition before us, to
<PB N="64" REF="71">
con&s;i&s;t of Ab&s;urdities, Improbabilities,
and Incredibilities; and whether they are
not prophetical and parabolical Narratives
of what will be my&s;teriou&s;ly, and more
wonderfully done by <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I appeal to
my <HI>Readers.</HI></P>
<P>After another Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome other
Miracles, I intend to take into Examinati|on
the &s;everal Stories of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s rai&s;ing of the
Dead as of <HI>Lazarus, Jairus</HI>'s Daughter,
and the Widow's Son of <HI>Naim</HI>; which
reputedly are <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s grand Miracles;
but for all the &s;eeming Greatne&s;s and Ex|cellency
of them, I don't doubt but to
give the Letter of the&s;e Stories a To&s;s out
of the Creed of a con&s;iderate and wi&s;e Man;
at lea&s;t &s;how their In&s;ufficiency for the Pur|po&s;e
for which they have been hitherto
apply'd. And if I &s;hould afterwards, by
the Leave and Patience of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> give my Objection again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Re&s;urrection a Review, and &s;ome more
Force, then what will become of the
Argument of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Power, Authority,
and <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI> from his Miracles?</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles, I am, as
Opportunity &s;erves, to take into Con&s;i|deration
&s;ome of the Hi&s;torical Parts of
his Life; and &s;hew them to be no le&s;s &s;en&s;e|le&s;s,
ab&s;urd and ridiculous than his Mi|racles.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72">
And why may I not &s;ometimes treat
on the Parables of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and &s;how what
non&s;en&s;ical and ab&s;urd Things they are,
according to the Expo&s;itions of our mo&s;t
famous Commentators of the&s;e la&s;t Ages.
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was certainly the ab&s;olute, and mo&s;t
con&s;ummate Perfection of a <HI>Cabali&s;t,</HI>
<HI>My&s;ti&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Paraboli&s;t</HI> and <HI>Enigmati&s;t</HI>; but
according to modern Commentaries and
Paraphra&s;es, he was the mere&s;t Ideot and
Blockhead that ever open'd his Mouth,
in that &s;ort of Learning, to the In&s;tructi|on
of Mankind. And I am oblig'd a
little to &s;peak to the Ab&s;urdities of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Doctrine and Parables, becau&s;e one Article
of the Pro&s;ecution again&s;t me was for &s;ay|ing,
<HI>that any of the Philo&s;ophers of the Gen|tiles,</HI>
or <HI>any rational Man</HI> (meaning accord|ing
to modern Expo&s;itions) <HI>would make a
better Teacher, than Je&s;us was.</HI></P>
<P>What a great deal of Work have I up|on
my Hands, which, if God &s;pare my
Life and Health, I intend to go on with:
If what I have already done in it be not
acceptable to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> their Way to pre|vent
the Pro&s;ecution of this great Un|dertaking,
is to battle me upon what's
pa&s;t. Who knows but they may write, if
they would try their Strength, &s;o acutely
in Defence of the Letter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Mi|racles
already di&s;cu&s;s'd, as may effectually
<PB N="66" REF="73">
&s;top my Mouth, and prevent my giv|ing
them any more Trouble of this Kind?
And I &s;uppo&s;e I have now gotten an
Adver&s;ary in the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s,
Who has already di&s;charg'd one Fool's Bolt
at me.</P>
<P>There has nothing been a more com|mon
Subject of Declamation among the
the <HI>Clergy</HI> than the <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of Chri|&s;tianity,
which mu&s;t be under&s;tood of
the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Life and Doctrine,
or the Application of the Word <HI>Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s</HI>
to the Chri&s;tian Religion is im|pertinent.
But if I proceed, as I have
begun in this Work, I &s;hall &s;hew Chi&s;tiani|ty,
as it is under&s;tood, to be the mo&s;t
unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd Story, that ever
was told; and our modern Sy&s;tems of
Theology groundle&s;s and &s;en&s;le&s;s in al|mo&s;t
every Part of them. <HI>Mahometani&s;m,</HI>
without Offence be it &s;poken, is a more
<HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Religion than the Chri&s;tian, up|on
modern <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Sy&s;tems.</HI></P>
<P>If what I here &s;ay is offen&s;ive to our
<HI>Divines,</HI> the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> is open for them as well
as for my&s;elf, and they may, if they can,
&s;hew their Re&s;entment of it. Thanks un|to
God and our mo&s;t excellent Civil Go|vernment
for &s;uch a Liberty of the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI>:
A Liberty that will lead and conduct us
to the Fountain of Wi&s;dom and Philo&s;o|phy,
which Re&s;traint is a down-right Enemy
<PB N="67" REF="74">
to. And that this Ble&s;&s;ing of Liber|ty
may be continued, for all <HI>Bi&s;hop Smal|brook</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Rogers's Hobbi&s;m,</HI> is, I dare
&s;ay, the De&s;ire of the curious, inqui&s;itive,
and philo&s;ophical Part of Mankind. If
this Liberty &s;hould be taken away, what
a notable Figure will our <HI>Divines</HI> make
from the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Pulpit,</HI> declaming
on the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Excellency and Per|fection
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, without
an Adver&s;ary; and telling their Congre|gations,
that all, their bittere&s;t and acute&s;t
Enemies can object, is clearly an&s;wered!</P>
<P>The <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> of late Years, has been pro|ductive
of &s;o many cogent and per&s;ua&s;ive
Arguments for Liberty of debate, and the
Advocates for this Liberty, in the Judg|ment
of the impartial and con&s;iderate,
have &s;o far gotten the better of their
Adver&s;aries, that I wonder any one can
appear in behalf of Per&s;ecution. If I was
a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> or <HI>Doctor</HI> in <HI>Divinity,</HI> I &s;houd
think it a Di&s;grace to my Station and E|ducation
to ask the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Ci|vil
Authority to protect my Religion: I
&s;hould judge my &s;elf unworthy of the
Wages and Emoluments I enjoy'd, for the
Preaching and Propagation of the Go&s;pel,
if I was unable to give an An&s;wer to a|ny
one, that ask'd a Rea&s;on of my Faith:
Or if I was &s;o Shallow-pated, as to
<PB N="68" REF="75">
think Here&s;ie and Infidelity puni&s;hable by
the Civil Magi&s;trate, I &s;hould think my|&s;elf
as much oblig'd to confute by
<HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as he is to puni&s;h by the <HI>Sword.</HI>
If the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> had taken this
Cour&s;e with me; if he had publi&s;h'd a
Refutation of my &s;uppo&s;ed Errors, as
well as endeavour'd at a Pro&s;ecution
of me for them, I had forgiven him the
Wrongs and Injuries done me, and made
no repeated Demands of Satisfaction for
them.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity is, as I believe, founded
on a Rock of Wi&s;dom; and what's more,
has an omnipotent and omni&s;cient God
on its Side, who can incline the Hearts
of Men to believe, and open the Eyes of
their Under&s;tanding to di&s;cern the Truth
of it; con&s;equently there can be no Dan|ger
in the Attempts of our Adver&s;aries,
whether <HI>Jews, Turks</HI> or Dome&s;tick <HI>In|fidels,</HI>
again&s;t it. But Per&s;ecution implys
Weakne&s;s and Impotency in God to defend
his own Cau&s;e; or his Prie&s;ts would not
move for the Help of the Arm of Fle&s;h in
Vindication of it. And if, at this Time
of Day, after &s;o many Treati&s;es of <HI>lnfi|dels,</HI>
and &s;ome of them as yet unan&s;wered,
again&s;t our Religion, this good Cau&s;e
&s;hould be taken out of the Hands of
God, and committed to the Care of the
<PB N="69" REF="76">
Civil Magi&s;trate; if in&s;tead of Rea&s;on,
the Clergy &s;hould have Recour&s;e to Force,
what will By-&s;tanders, and even Well|wi&s;hers
to Chri&s;tianity &s;ay? Nothing le&s;s
than that <HI>Infidels</HI> had gotten the better of
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Mini&s;ters, and beaten them at
their own Weapons of Rea&s;on and Argu|ment.</P>
<P>The two great Pleaders for Per&s;ecu|tion,
to the Di&s;grace of them&s;elves and
Di&s;honour of our Religion, that have
lately aro&s;e are Dr. <HI>Rogers</HI> and the <HI>Bi|&s;hop</HI>
of St. <HI>David</HI>'s. Dr. <HI>Rogers</HI>'s chief
Rea&s;on again&s;t Liberty of Debate, is be|cau&s;e,
as he &s;ays, it is pernicious to the
Peace and Welfare of the Community, by
un&s;ettling the Minds of the People about
the Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed: But here's no Con|&s;equence, unle&s;s it could be proved, that
&s;uch as the great Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Scheme,</HI> have it in their Hearts to rai&s;e
Mobbs upon the Government, and to beat
out the Brains of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> All the
Harm, or rather Good, they aim at, is to
exerci&s;e the Wits of the <HI>Clergy</HI> with their
Doubts and Objections; and if the Pa&s;&s;i|ons
of our <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks</HI> are not rai&s;ed up|on
it, to the doing of Violence to the&s;e
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Peace of the Publick will
never de di&s;turb'd. As to my&s;elf, tho'
I have a va&s;t and numerous Party on
<PB N="70" REF="77">
my Side, no le&s;s than all the Fathers and
primitive Chri&s;tians for &s;ome Ages; yet
as we were peaceable and quiet Subjects
of old, and pa&s;&s;ively obedient to the <HI>Empe|rors</HI>
of <HI>Rome</HI>; &s;o we will continue to the
Civil Authority of this Nation. We on|ly
take the Liberty to awaken the Cler|gy
out of a Lethargy of Dulne&s;s and Ig|norance;
and hope the Civil Magi&s;trate
will con&s;ider the Goodne&s;s and Charity
of our Intentions, and guard us again&s;t
their In&s;ults for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of St. <HI>David</HI>'s <NOTE N="61" PLACE="foot">Sermon before the Society for Reformation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 12.</NOTE> &s;ays,
"It is ab&s;urd to a&s;&s;ert, that the Liberties
of any Nation will allow, with Impu|nity,
a Set of di&s;tingui&s;h'd Infidels to
in&s;ult and treat with the greate&s;t Con|tempt
and Scorn the mo&s;t &s;acred and
important Truths, that are openly pro|fe&s;&s;ed,
by the whole Body of the Peo|ple,
of whatever Denomination." By
a Set of Infidels, I &s;uppo&s;e, he means me
and the Fathers: And by <HI>treating with
Contempt and Scorn the mo&s;t &s;acred and im|portant
Truths,</HI> he means, our burle&s;quing,
bantering and ridiculing the <HI>Clergy</HI> for
their Mini&s;try of the Letter: And for <HI>this</HI>
he would, I conceive, have incen&s;ed the
<HI>Societies</HI> for Reformation of Manners to a
Pro&s;ecution of me. And if they had not
<PB N="71" REF="78">
been wi&s;er, and more merciful than their
Preacher, I mu&s;t have gone to Pot. But
why &s;hould the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> di&s;like this way of
Writing? Don't he know, that the Fathers
of the Church u&s;ed to je&s;t and &s;coff at the
<HI>Gentiles</HI> and their Prie&s;ts for their fooli&s;h
Super&s;titions? Don't he know, that our
<HI>Reformers</HI> banter'd and ridicul'd Pope|ry
out of Doors, and almo&s;t within the
Memory of Man, it was reckon'd but
a dull Sermon, that was not well
humm'd for its Puns and Je&s;ts on the
Papi&s;ts? why then &s;hould the <HI>Bi&s;top</HI> be a|gain&s;t
that way of writing, which was of
good U&s;e to the <HI>Reformers,</HI> and fir&s;t <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI>?
The grand Subject for <HI>Burle&s;que</HI>
and <HI>Banter,</HI> in my Opinion, is <HI>Infidelity</HI>;
and that <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> who can't break two Je&s;ts
upon <HI>Infidels</HI> for their one upon Chri&s;ti|anity,
has but a &s;mall Share of Wit. The
Chri&s;tian Religion according to the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI>
will abide the Te&s;t of calm and &s;edate Rea|&s;oning
again&s;t it, but can't bear a Je&s;t; O
&s;trange!</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e two Contenders for
Per&s;ecution to the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of acuter
Pens. What I have here pleaded for Li|berty
is not through any Fears of Danger
to my&s;elf, but for the Love of Truth and
Advancement of Chri&s;tianity, which, with|out
it, can't be defended, propagated and
<PB N="72" REF="79">
&s;incerely embraced. And therefore hope,
that the Controver&s;y before us, between
<HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tates</HI> will be continued by
the Indulgence of the Government, till
Truth ari&s;es and &s;hines bright to the Di&s;&s;i|pation
of the Mi&s;ts of Error and Ignorance;
like the Light of the Sun to the Di&s;per&s;ion
of the Darkne&s;s of the Night. I will by
God's Leave, go on to bear my part in the
Controver&s;y; And, if it was not more a|gain&s;t
the Intere&s;ts than Rea&s;on of the
<HI>Clergy</HI> to believe me, would again &s;olemn|ly
declare that what I do in it is with a
View to the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> our &s;piritual
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> to whom be Glory for ever.
Amen.</P>
