<HEAD>To the HONOURABLE George Lyttleton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> One of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the TREASURY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING your con&s;tant Re|fu&s;al, when I have a&s;ked Leave to prefix your Name to this Dedication, I mu&s;t-&s;till in&s;i&s;t on my Right to de&s;ire your Protection of this Work.</P>
<P>To you, Sir, it is owing that this Hi&s;tory was ever began. It was by your De&s;ire that I fir&s;t thought of &s;uch a Compo&s;ition. So many Years have &s;ince pa&s;t, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this Circum&s;tance: But your De&s;ires are to me in the Nature of Commands; and the Impre&s;&s;ion of them is never to be era&s;ed from my Memory.</P>
<P>Again, Sir, without your A&s;&s;i&s;tance this Hi&s;tory had never been completed. Be not
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
&s;tartled at the A&s;&s;ertion. I do not intend to draw on you the Su&s;picion of being a Romance Writer. I mean no more than that I partly owe to you my Exi&s;tance during great Part of the Time which I have employed in compo&s;ing it: another Matter which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to remind you of; &s;ince there are certain Actions of which you are apt to be extremely forget|ful; but of the&s;e I hope I &s;hall always have a better Memory than your&s;elf.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is owing to you that the Hi&s;tory appears what it now is. If there be in this Work, as &s;ome have been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, a &s;tronger Picture of a truly benevolent Mind than is to be found in any other, who that knows you, and a particular Acquaintance of yours, will doubt whence that Benevolence hath been copied? The World will not, I be|lieve, make me the Compliment of thinking I took it from my&s;elf. I care not: This they &s;hall own, that the two Per&s;ons from whom I have taken it, that is to &s;ay, two of the be&s;t and worthie&s;t Men in the World, are &s;trongly and zealou&s;ly my Friends. I might be con|tented with this, and yet my Vanity will add a third to the Number; and him one of the greate&s;t and noble&s;t, not only in his Rank, but in every public and private Virtue. But here whil&s;t my Gratitude for the princely Benefac|tions of the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> bur&s;ts from my Heart, you mu&s;t forgive my reminding you,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
that it was vou who fir&s;t recommended me to the Notice of my Benefactor.</P>
<P>And what are your Objections to the Allow|ance of the Honour which I have &s;olicited? Why, you have commended the Book &s;o warmly, that you &s;hould be a&s;hamed of read|ing your Name before the Dedication. In|deed, Sir, if the Book it&s;elf doth not make you a&s;hamed of your Commendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not to give up my Right to your Protection and Pa|tronage, becau&s;e you have commended my Book: For though I acknowledge &s;o many Ob|ligations to you, I do not add this to the Num|ber; in which Friend&s;hip, I am convinced, hath &s;o little Share: Since that can neither bia&s;s your Judgment, nor pervert your Integrity. An Enemy may at any Time obtain your Com|mendation by only de&s;erving it; and the ut|mo&s;t which the Faults of your Friends can hope for is your Silence; or, perhaps, if too &s;everely accu&s;ed, your gentle Palliation.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, I &s;u&s;pect, that your Di&s;like of public Prai&s;e is your true Objection to granting my Reque&s;t. I have ob&s;erved, that you have in common with my two other Friends, an Unwillingne&s;s to hear the lea&s;t Mention of your own Virtues; that, as a great Poet &s;ays of one of you, (he might ju&s;tly have &s;aid it of all three) you</P>
<Q>Do Good by &s;tealth, and blu&s;h to find it Fame.</Q>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
If Men of this Di&s;po&s;ition are as careful to &s;hun Applau&s;e, as others are to e&s;cape Cen|&s;ure, how ju&s;t mu&s;t be your Apprehen&s;ion of your Character falling into my Hands; &s;ince what would not a Man have Rea&s;on to dread, if attacked by an Author who had received from him Injuries equal to my Obligations to you!</P>
<P>And will not this dread of Cen&s;ure increa&s;e in Proportion to the Matter which a Man is con&s;cious of having afforded for it? If his whole Life, for In&s;tance, &s;hould have been one con|tinued Subject of Satire, he may well trem|ble when an incen&s;ed Satyri&s;t takes him in Hand. Now, Sir, if we apply this to your mode&s;t Aver&s;ion to Panegyric, how rea&s;ona|bly will your Fears of me appear.</P>
<P>Yet &s;urely you might have gratified my Ambition, from this &s;ingle Con&s;ideration, that I &s;hall always prefer the Indulgence of your Inclinations to the Satisfaction of my own. A very &s;trong In&s;tance of which I &s;hall give you in this Addre&s;s; in which I am deter|mined to follow the Example of all other Dedicators, and will con&s;ider not what my Patron really de&s;erves to have written, but what he will be be&s;t plea&s;ed to read.</P>
<P>Without further Preface then, I here pre|&s;ent you with the Labours of &s;ome Years of my Life. What Merit the&s;e Labours have is already known to your&s;elf. If from your favourable Judgment, I have conceived
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
&s;ome e&s;teem for them, it cannot be imputed to Vanity; &s;ince I &s;hould have agreed as im|plicitly to your Opinion, had it been given in Favour of any other Man's Production. Ne|gatively, at lea&s;t, I may be allowed to &s;ay, that had I been &s;en&s;ible of any great Demerit in the Work, you are the la&s;t Per&s;on to who&s;e Protection I would have ventured to recom|mend it.</P>
<P>From the Name of my Patron, indeed, I hope my Reader will be convinced, at his ve|ry Entrance on this Work, that he will find in the whole Cour&s;e of it nothing prejudicial to the Cau&s;e of Religion and Virtue; nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of Decen|cy, nor which can offend even the cha&s;te&s;t Eye in the Peru&s;al. On the contrary, I de|clare, that to recommend Goodne&s;s and In|nocence hath been my &s;incere Endeavour in this Hi&s;tory. This hone&s;t Purpo&s;e you have been plea&s;ed to think I have attained: And to &s;ay the Truth, it is likelie&s;t to be attained in Books of this Kind; for an Example is a Kind of Picture, in which Virtue becomes as it were an Object of Sight, and &s;trikes us with an Idea of that Loviline&s;s, which <HI>Plato</HI> a&s;&s;erts there is in her naked Charms.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides di&s;playing that Beauty of Virtue which may attract the Admiration of Man|kind, I have attempted to engage a &s;tronger Motive to Human Action in her Favour, by convincing Men, that their true Intere&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
directs them to a pur&s;uit of her. For this Purpo&s;e I have &s;hewn, that no Acqui&s;itions of Guilt can compen&s;ate the Lo&s;s of that &s;o|lid inward Comfort of Mind, which is the &s;ure Companion of Innocence and Virtue; nor can in the lea&s;t balance the Evil of that Horror and Anxiety which, in their Room, Guilt introduces into our Bo&s;oms. And a|gain, that as the&s;e Acqui&s;itions are in them|&s;elves generally worthle&s;s, &s;o are the Means to attain them not only ba&s;e and infamous, but at be&s;t incertain, and always full of Dan|ger. La&s;tly, I have endeavoured &s;trongly to inculcate, that Virtue and Innocence can &s;carce ever be injured but by Indi&s;cretion; and that it is this alone which often betrays them into the Snares that Deceit and Villainy &s;pread for them. A Moral which I have the more indu&s;triou&s;ly laboured, as the teaching it is, of all others, the likelie&s;t to be attend|ed with Succe&s;s; &s;ince, I believe, it is much ea&s;ier to make good Men wi&s;e, than to make bad Men good.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Purpo&s;es I have employed all the Wit and Humour of which I am Ma&s;ter in the following Hi&s;tory; wherein I have en|deavoured to laugh Mankind out of their fa|vourite Follies and Vices. How far I have &s;ucceeded in this good Attempt, I &s;hall &s;ub|mit to the candid Reader, with only two Reque&s;ts: Fir&s;t, That he will not expect to find Perfection in this Work; and Secondly,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
That he will excu&s;e &s;ome Parts of it, if they fall &s;hort of that little Merit which I hope may appear in others.</P>
<P>I will detain you, Sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a Preface, while I profe&s;&s;ed to write a Dedication. But how can it be otherwi&s;e? I dare not prai&s;e you; and the on|ly Means I know of to avoid it, when you are in my Thoughts, are either to be entirely &s;ilent, or to turn my Thoughts to &s;ome other Subject.</P>
<P>Pardon, therefore, what I have &s;aid in this Epi&s;tle, not only without your Con&s;ent, but ab&s;olutely again&s;t it; and give me at lea&s;t Leave, in this public Manner, to declare, that I am, with the highe&s;t Re&s;pect and Gra|titude,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>CHAP I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Introduction to the Work, or Bill of Fare to the Fea&s;t.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AN Author ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf, not as a Gentleman who gives a private or eleemo&s;ynary Treat, but rather as one who keeps a publick Ordinary, at which all Per&s;ons are welcome for their Money. In the former Ca&s;e, it is well known, that the Entertain|er provides what Fare he plea&s;es; and tho' this &s;hould be very indifferent, and utterly di&s;agreeable to the Ta&s;te of his Company, they mu&s;t not find any Fault; nay, on the contrary, Good-Breeding for|ces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is &s;et before them. Now the contrary of this happens to the Ma&s;ter of an Ordinary.
<PB N="2" REF="17">
Men who pay for what they eat, will in&s;i&s;t on gratifying their Palates, however nice and even whim&s;ical the&s;e may prove; and if every Thing is not agreeable to their Ta&s;te, will challenge a Right to cen&s;ure, to abu&s;e, and to d&mdash;m their Dinner without controul.</P>
<P>To prevent therefore giving Offence to their Cu&s;tomers by any &s;uch Di&s;appointment, it hath been u&s;ual, with the hone&s;t and well-meaning Ho&s;t, to provide a Bill of Fare, which all Per&s;ons may peru&s;e at their fir&s;t Entrance into the Hou&s;e; and, having thence acquainted them&s;elves with the Entertainment which they may expect, may ei|ther &s;tay and regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to &s;ome other Ordinary bet|ter accommodated to their Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>As we do not di&s;dain to borrow Wit or Wi&s;dom from any Man who is capable of lending us either, we have conde&s;cended to take a Hint from the&s;e hone&s;t Victuallers, and &s;hall prefix not only a ge|neral Bill of Fare to our whole Entertainment, but &s;hall likewi&s;e give the Reader particular Bills to every Cour&s;e which is to be &s;erved up in this and the en&s;uing Volumes.</P>
<P>The Provi&s;ion then which we have here made is no other than HUMAN NATURE. Nor do I fear that my &s;en&s;ible Reader, though mo&s;t luxurious in his Ta&s;te, will &s;tart, cavil, or be offended, becau&s;e I have named but one Article. The Tortoi&s;e, as the Alderman of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> well learned in eating, knows by much Experience, be&s;ides the delicious <HI>Caliba&s;h</HI> and <HI>Calipee,</HI> contains many different Kinds of Food; nor can the learned Reader be ignorant, that in <HI>Human Nature,</HI> tho' here collected under one general Name, is &s;uch prodigious Variety, that a Cook will have &s;ooner gone through all the &s;e|veral Species of animal and vegetable Food in the
<PB N="3" REF="18">
World, than an Author will be able to exhau&s;t &s;o exten&s;ive a Subject.</P>
<P>An Objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that this Di&s;h is too common and Vulgar; for what el&s;e is the Subject of all Ro|mances, Novels, Plays and Poems, with which the Stalls abound. Many exqui&s;ite Viands might be rejected by the Epicure, if it was a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for his contemning of them as common and vulgar, that &s;omething was to be found in the mo&s;t paultry Alleys under the &s;ame Name. In reality, true Nature is as difficult to be met with in Au|thors, as the <HI>Bayonne</HI> Ham or <HI>Bologna</HI> Sau&s;age is to be found in the Shops.</P>
<P>But the whole, to continue the &s;ame Metaphor, con&s;i&s;ts in the Cookery of the Author; for, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us,</P>
<Q><L>True Wit is Nature to Advantage dre&s;t,</L>
<L>What oft' was thought, but ne'er &s;o well expre&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;ame Animal which hath the Honour to have &s;ome Part of his Fle&s;h eaten at the Table of a Duke, may perhaps be degraded in another Part, and &s;ome of his Limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vile&s;t Stall in Town. Where then lies the Dif|ference between the Food of the Nobleman and the Porter, if both were at Dinner on the &s;ame Ox or Calf, but in the &s;ea&s;oning, the dre&s;&s;ing, the gar|ni&s;hing, and the &s;etting forth. Hence the one provokes and incites the mo&s;t languid Appetite, and the other turns and palls that which is the &s;harpe&s;t and keene&s;t.</P>
<P>In like manner, the Excellence of the men|tal Entertainment con&s;i&s;ts le&s;s in the Subject, than in the Author's Skill in dre&s;&s;ing it up. How plea&s;|ed therefore will the Reader be to find, that we
<PB N="4" REF="19">
have, in the following Work, adhered clo&s;ely to one of the highe&s;t Principles of the be&s;t Cook which the pre&s;ent Age, or perhaps that of <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> hath produced. This great Man, as is well known to all polite Lovers of eating, begins at fir&s;t by &s;etting plain Things before his hungry Gue&s;ts, ri|&s;ing afterwards by Degrees, as their Stomachs may be &s;uppo&s;ed to decrea&s;e, to the very Quinte&s;|&s;ence of Sauce and Spices. In like manner, we &s;hall repre&s;ent Human Nature at fir&s;t to the keen Appetite of our Reader, in that more plain and &s;imple Manner in which it is found in the Country, and &s;hall hereafter ha&s;h and ragoo it with all the high <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Sea&s;oning of Affectation and Vice which Courts and Cities afford. By the&s;e Means, we doubt not but our Reader may be ren|dered de&s;irous to read on for ever, as the great Per&s;on, ju&s;t abovementioned, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have made &s;ome Per&s;ons eat.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much, we will now de|tain tho&s;e, who like our Bill of Fare, no longer from our Diet, and &s;hall proceed directly to &s;erve up the fir&s;t Cour&s;e of our Hi&s;tory, for their En|tertainment.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A &s;hort De&s;cription of 'Squire</HI> Allworthy, <HI>and a fuller Account of Mi&s;s</HI> Bridget Allworthy <HI>his Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN that Part of the We&s;tern Divi&s;ion of this Kingdom, which is commonly called <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lately lived (and perhaps lives &s;till) a Gentleman who&s;e Name was <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and who might well be called the Favourite of both Nature and Fortune; for both of the&s;e &s;eem to have con|tended
<PB N="5" REF="20">
which &s;hould ble&s;s and enrich him mo&s;t. In this Contention, Nature may &s;eem to &s;ome to have come off victorious, as &s;he be&s;towed on him many Gifts; while Fortune had only one Gift in her Power; but in pouring forth this, &s;he was &s;o very profu&s;e, that others perhaps may think this &s;ingle Endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various Ble&s;&s;ings which he enjoyed from Nature. From the former of the&s;e, he derived an agreeable Per&s;on, a &s;ound Con&s;titution, a &s;olid Un|der&s;tanding, and a benevolent Heart; by the lat|ter, he was decreed to the Inheritance of one of the large&s;t E&s;tates in the County.</P>
<P>This Gentleman had, in his Youth, married a very worthy and beautiful Woman, of whom he had been extremely fond: By her he had three Children, all of whom died in their Infancy. He had likewi&s;e had the Misfortune of burying this beloved Wife her&s;elf, about five Years before the Time in which this Hi&s;tory chu&s;es to &s;et out. This Lo&s;s, however great, he bore like a Man of Sen&s;e and Con&s;tancy; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, he would often talk a little whim&s;ically on this Head: For he &s;ometimes &s;aid, he looked on him&s;elf &s;till as married, and con&s;idered his Wife as only gone a little before him, a Journey which he &s;hould mo&s;t certainly, &s;ooner or later, take after her; and that he had not the lea&s;t Doubt of meeting her again, in a Place where he &s;hould never part with her more. Sen|timents for which his Sen&s;e was arraigned by one Part of his Neighbours, his Religion by a &s;econd, and his Sincerity by a third.</P>
<P>He now lived, for the mo&s;t Part, retired in the Country, with one Si&s;ter, for whom he had a very tender Affection. This Lady was now &s;omewhat pa&s;t the Age of 30, an Aera, at which, in the Opi|nion of the malicious, the Title of Old Maid
<PB N="6" REF="21">
may, with no Impropriety, be a&s;&s;umed. She was of that Species of Women, whom you rather com|mend for good Qualities than Beauty, and who are generally called by their own Sex, very good Sort of Women&mdash;as good a Sort of Woman, Madam, as you would wi&s;h to know. Indeed &s;he was &s;o far from regretting Want of Beauty, that &s;he never mention'd that Perfection (if it can be called one) without Contempt; and would often thank God &s;he was not as hand&s;ome as Mi&s;s &s;uch a one, whom perhaps Beauty had led into Errors, which &s;he might have otherwi&s;e avoided. Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget All|worthy</HI> (for that was the Name of this Lady) ve|ry rightly conceived the Charms of Per&s;on in a Woman to be no better than Snares for her&s;elf, as well as for others, and yet &s;o di&s;creet was &s;he in her Conduct, that her Prudence was as much on the Guard, as if &s;he had had all the Snares to ap|prehend which were ever laid for her whole Sex. Indeed, I have ob&s;erved (tho' it may &s;eem un|accountable to the Reader) that this Guard of Pru|dence, like the Trained Bands, is always readie&s;t to go on Duty where there is the lea&s;t Danger. It often ba&s;ely and cowardly de&s;erts tho&s;e Paragons for whom the Men are all wi&s;hing, &s;ighing, dy|ing, and &s;preading every Net in their Power; and con&s;tantly attends at the Heels of that higher Or|der of Women, for whom the other Sex have a more di&s;tant and awful Re&s;pect, and whom, (from De&s;pair, I suppo&s;e, of Succe&s;s) they never venture to attack.</P>
<P>Reader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to acquaint thee, that I intend to digre&s;s, through this whole Hi&s;tory, as often as I &s;ee Occa&s;ion: Of which I am my&s;elf a better Judge than any pitiful Critic whatever; and here I mu&s;t de&s;ire all tho&s;e Critics to mind their own
<PB N="7" REF="22">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to intermeddle with Affairs, or Works, which no ways concern them: For, till they produce the Authority by which they are con|&s;tituted Judges, I &s;hall plead to their Juri&s;diction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>An odd Accident which befel Mr.</HI> Allworthy, <HI>at his Return home. The decent Behaviour of Mrs.</HI> Deborah Wilkins, <HI>with &s;ome proper Animadver|&s;ions on Ba&s;tards.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have told my Reader, in the preceding Chap|ter, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> inherited a large For|tune; that he had a good Heart, and no Family. Hence, doubtle&s;s, it will be concluded by many, that he lived like an hone&s;t Man, owed no one a Shilling, took nothing but what was his own, kept a good Hou&s;e, entertained his Neighbours with a hearty Welcome at his Table, and was charitable to the Poor, <HI>i. e.</HI> to tho&s;e who had rather beg than work, by giving them the Offals from it; that he died immen&s;ely rich, and built an Ho&s;|pital.</P>
<P>And true it is, that he did many of the&s;e Things; but, had he done nothing more, I &s;hould have left him to have recorded his own Merit on &s;ome fair Free-Stone over the Door of that Ho&s;pital. Mat|ters of a much more extraordinary Kind are to be the Subject of this Hi&s;tory, or I &s;hould gro&s;sly mi&s;pend my Time in writing &s;o voluminous a Work; and you, my &s;agacious Friend, might, with equal Profit and Plea&s;ure, travel through &s;ome Pages, which certain droll Authors have been fa|cetiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call <HI>The Hi&s;tory of England.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had been ab&s;ent a full Quarter of a Year in <HI>London,</HI> on &s;ome very particular Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="23">
tho' I know not what it was; but judge of its Importance, by its having detained him &s;o long from home, whence he had not been ab&s;ent a Month at a Time during the Space of many Years. He came to his Hou&s;e very late in the Evening, and after a &s;hort Supper with his Si&s;ter, retired much fatigued to his Chamber. Here, having &s;pent &s;ome Minutes on his Knees, a Cu&s;tom which he never broke through on any Account, he was preparing to &s;tep into Bed, when, upon opening the Cloaths, to his great Surprize, he beheld an Infant, wrapt up in &s;ome coar&s;e Linnen, in a &s;weet and profound Sleep, between his Sheets. He &s;tood &s;ome Time lo&s;t in A&s;toni&s;hment at this Sight; but, as Good|nature was alway the A&s;cendant in his Mind, he &s;oon began to be touched with Sentiments of Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the little Wretch before him. He then rang his Bell, and ordered an elderly Woman Ser|vant to ri&s;e immediately and come to him, and in the mean Time was &s;o eager in contemplating the Beauty of Innocence, appearing in tho&s;e lively Co|lours with which Infancy and Sleep always di&s;play it, that his Thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he was in his Shirt, when the Matron came in. She had indeed given her Ma&s;ter &s;ufficient Time to dre&s;s him&s;elf; for out of Re&s;pect to him, and Re|gard to Decency, &s;he had &s;pent many Minutes in adju&s;ting her Hair at the Looking-gla&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding all the Hurry in which &s;he had been &s;um|moned by the Servant, and tho' her Ma&s;ter, for ought &s;he knew, lay expiring in an Apoplexy, or in &s;ome other Fit.</P>
<P>It will not be wondered at, that a Creature, who had &s;o &s;trict a Regard to Decency in her own Per|&s;on, &s;hould be &s;hocked at the lea&s;t Deviation from it in another. She therefore no &s;ooner opened
<PB N="9" REF="24">
the Door, and &s;aw her Ma&s;ter &s;tanding by the Bed-&s;ide in his Shirt, with a Candle in his Hand, than &s;he &s;tarted back in a mo&s;t terrible Fright, and might perhaps have &s;wooned away, had he not now recollected his being undre&s;t, and put an End to her Terrors, by de&s;iring her to &s;tay without the Door till he had thrown &s;ome Cloaths over his Back, and was become incapable of &s;hocking the pure Eyes of Mrs. <HI>Deborah Wilkins,</HI> who, tho' in' the 52d Year of her Age, vowed &s;he had never be|held a Man without his Coat. Sneerers and pro|phane Wits may perhaps laugh at her fir&s;t Fright, yet my graver Reader, when he con&s;iders the Time of Night, the Summons from her Bed, and the Situation in which &s;he found her Ma&s;ter, will high|ly ju&s;tify and applaud her Conduct; unle&s;s the Prudence, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to attend Mai|dens at that Period of Life at which Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> had arrived, &s;hould a little le&s;&s;en his Admiration.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> returned into the Room, and was acquainted by her Ma&s;ter with the finding the little Infant, her Con&s;ternation was rather greater than his had been; nor could &s;he refrain from cry|ing out with great Horror of Accent as well as Look, 'My good Sir! what's to be done?" Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> an&s;wered, &s;he mu&s;t take care of the Child that Evening, and in the Morning he would give Orders to provide it a Nur&s;e, 'Yes, Sir,' &s;ays &s;he,' and I hope your Wor&s;hip will &s;end out your Warrant to take up the Hu&s;&s;y its Mother (for &s;he mu&s;t be one of the Neighbourhood) and I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee her committed to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> and whipt at the Cart's Tail. Indeed &s;uch wicked Sluts cannot be two &s;everely puni&s;hed. I'll war|rant 'tis not her fir&s;t, by her Impudence in laying it to your Wor&s;hip.' In laying it to me, <HI>Debo|rah,'</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Allworthy,'</HI> 'I can't think &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="25">
hath any &s;uch De&s;ign. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he hath only taken this Method to provide for her Child; and truly I am glad &s;he hath not done wor&s;e,' I don't know what is wor&s;e,' cries <HI>Deborah,</HI> than for &s;uch wicked Strumpets to lay their Sins at hone&s;t Mens Doors; and though your Wor&s;hip knows your own Innocence, yet the World is cen&s;orious; and it hath been many an hone&s;t Man's Hap to pa&s;s for the Father of Children he never begot; and if your Wor&s;hip &s;hould provide for the Child, it may make the People the apter to believe: Be&s;ides, why &s;hould your Wor&s;hip provide for what the Pari&s;h is obliged to maintain? For my own Part, if it was an hone&s;t Man's Child indeed; but for my own Part, it goes a|gain&s;t me to touch tho&s;e misbegotton Wretches, whom I don't look upon as my Fellow Creatures. Faugh, how it &s;tinks! It doth not &s;mell like a Chri&s;tian. If I might be &s;o bold to give my Ad|vice, I would have it put in a Basket, and &s;ent out and laid at the Church-Warden's Door. It is a good Night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well wrapt up, and put in a warm Basket, it is two to one but it lives 'till it is found in the Morning. But if it &s;hould not, we have di&s;charged our Duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for &s;uch Creatures to die in a &s;tate of Innocence, than to grow up and imi|tate their Mothers; for nothing better can be ex|pected of them.'</P>
<P>There were &s;ome Strokes in this Speech which, perhaps, would have offended Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> had he &s;trictly attended to it; but he had now got one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his Fingers into the Infant's Hand, which by its gentle Pre&s;&s;ure, &s;eeming to implore his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, had certainly out-pleaded the Eloquence of Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> had it been ten times greater than it was.
<PB N="11" REF="26">
He now gave Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> po&s;itive Orders to take the Child to her own Bed, and to call up a Maid|&s;ervant to provide it Pap and other things again&s;t it waked. He likewi&s;e ordered that proper Clothes &s;hould be procured for it early in the Morning, and that it &s;hould be brought to him&s;elf as &s;oon as he was &s;tirring.</P>
<P>Such was the Di&s;cernment of Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> and &s;uch the Re&s;pect &s;he bore her Ma&s;ter, under whom &s;he enjoyed a mo&s;t excellent Place, that her Scruples gave way to his peremptory Commands; and &s;he took the Child under her Arms, without any appa|rent Di&s;gu&s;t at the Illegality of its Birth; and decla|ring it was a &s;weet little Infant, walked off with it to her own Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> here betook him&s;elf to tho&s;e plea&s;ing Slumbers, which a Heart that hungers after Goodne&s;s is apt to enjoy, when thoroughly &s;atisfied. As the&s;e are po&s;&s;ibly &s;weeter than what are occa&s;ioned by any other hearty Meal, I &s;hould take more Pains to di&s;|play them to the Reader, if I knew any Air to re|commend him to for the procuring &s;uch an Appetite.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Reader's Neck brought into Danger by a De|&s;cription, his E&s;cape and the great Conde&s;cention of Mi&s;s</HI> Bridget Allworthy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Gothick</HI> Stile of Building could produce nothing nobler than Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e. There was an Air of Grandeur in it, that &s;truck you with Awe, and rival'd the Beauties of the be&s;t <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Architecture; and it was as commodious within, as venerable without.</P>
<P>It &s;tood on the South-ea&s;t Side of a Hill, but near|er the Bottom than the Top of it, &s;o as to be &s;heltered from the North-ea&s;t by a Grove of old Oaks, which ro&s;e above it in a gradual A&s;cent of near half a Mile,
<PB N="12" REF="27">
and yet high enough to enjoy a mo&s;t charming Pro|&s;pect of the Valley beneath.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the Grove was a fine Lawn &s;loping down towards the Hou&s;e, near the Summit of which ro&s;e a plentiful Spring, gu&s;hing out of a Rock cover|ed with Firs, and forming a con&s;tant Ca&s;cade of a|bout thirty Foot, not carried down a regular Flight of Steps, but tumbling in a natural Fall over the broken and mo&s;&s;y Stones, till it came to the bottom of the Rock; then running off in a pebly Channel, that with many le&s;&s;er Falls winded along, till it fell into a Lake at the Foot of the Hill, about a quarter of a Mile below the Hou&s;e on the South Side, and which was &s;een from every Room in the Front. Out of this Lake, which filled the Center of a beau|tiful Plain, embelli&s;hed with Groupes of Beeches and Elms, and fed with Sheep, i&s;&s;ued a River, that for &s;everal Miles was &s;een to meander through an amaz|ing Variety of Meadows and Woods, till it emptied it&s;elf into the Sea, with a large Arm of which, and an I&s;land beyond it, the pro&s;pect was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the right of this Valley opened another of le&s;s Extent, adorned with &s;everal Villages, and termina|ted by one of the Towers of an old ruined Abbey, grown over with Ivy, and Part of the Front which remained &s;till entire.</P>
<P>The left Hand Scene pre&s;ented the View of a fine Park, compo&s;ed of very unequal Ground, and agree|ably varied with all the Diver&s;ity that Hills, Lawns, Wood and Water, laid out with admirable Ta&s;te, but owing le&s;s to Art than to Nature, could give. Beyond this the Country gradually ro&s;e into a Ridge of wild Mountains, the Tops of which were above the Clouds.</P>
<P>It was now the Middle of <HI>May,</HI> and the Morning was remarkably &s;erene, when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> walked forth on the Terrace, where the Dawn opened e|very Minute that lovely Pro&s;pect we have before de|&s;cribed
<PB N="13" REF="28">
to his Eye. And now having &s;ent forth Streams of Light, which a&s;cended the blue Firmament before him as Harbingers preceding his Pomp, in the full Blaze of his Maje&s;ty, ro&s;e the Sun; than which one Object alone in this lower Creation could be more glorious, and that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf pre|&s;ented; a human Being replete with Benevolence, meditating in what manner he might render him&s;elf mo&s;t acceptable to his Creator, by doing mo&s;t good to his Creatures.</P>
<P>Reader, take care, I have unadvi&s;edly led thee to the Top of as high a Hill as Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s, and how to get thee down without breaking thy Neck, I do not well know. However, let us e'en venture to &s;lide down together, for Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> rings her Bell, and Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> is &s;ummoned to Breakfa&s;t, where I mu&s;t attend, and, if you plea&s;e, &s;hall be glad of your Company.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Compliments having pa&s;t between Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> and the Tea being poured out, he &s;ummoned Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> and told his Si&s;ter he had a Pre&s;ent for her; for which &s;he thanked him, imagining, I &s;uppo&s;e, it had been a Gown or &s;ome Ornament for her Per&s;on. Indeed, he very often made her &s;uch Pre&s;ents, and &s;he in Complai&s;ance to him &s;pent much time in adorning her&s;elf. I &s;ay, in Complai&s;ance to him, becau&s;e &s;he always expre&s;t the greate&s;t Contempt for Dre&s;s, and for tho&s;e Ladies who made it their Study.</P>
<P>But if &s;uch was her Expectation, how was &s;he di&s;|appointed, when Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> according to the Or|der &s;he had receiv'd from her Ma&s;ter, produced the little Infant. Great Surpri&s;es, as hath been ob&s;erved, are apt to be &s;ilent, and &s;o was Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> 'till her Brother began and told her the whole Story, which as the Reader knows already, we &s;hall not repeat.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> had always expre&s;t &s;o great a regard for what the Ladies are plea&s;ed to call Virtue, and
<PB N="14" REF="29">
had her&s;elf maintained &s;uch a Severity of Character, that it was expected, e&s;pecially by <HI>Wilkins,</HI> that &s;he would have vented much Bitterne&s;s on this Occa&s;ion, and would have voted for &s;ending the Child, as a kind of noxious Animal, immediately out of the Hou&s;e; but on the contrary, &s;he rather took the good-natur'd &s;ide of the que&s;tion, intimated &s;ome Compa&s;&s;ion for the helple&s;s little Creature, and com|mended her Brother's Charity in what he had done.</P>
<P>Perhaps the Reader may account for this Behaviour from her Conde&s;cen&s;ion to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> when we have informed him, that the good Man had ended his Narrative with owning a Re&s;olution to take care of the Child, and to breed him up as his own; for to ac|knowledge the Truth, &s;he was always ready to ob|lige her Brother, and very &s;eldom, if ever, contra|dicted his Sentiments; &s;he would indeed &s;ometimes make a few Ob&s;ervations, as, that Men were head|&s;trong and mu&s;t have their own way, and would wi&s;h &s;he had been ble&s;t with an independent Fortune; but the&s;e were always vented in a low Voice, and at the mo&s;t amounted only to what is called Muttering.</P>
<P>However, what &s;he withheld from the Infant, &s;he be&s;towed with the utmo&s;t Profu&s;ene&s;s on the poor un|known Mother, whom &s;he called an impudent Slut, a wanton Hu&s;&s;y, an audacious Harlot, a wicked Jade, a vile Strumpet, with every other Appellation with which the Tongue of Virtue never fails to la&s;h tho&s;e who bring a Di&s;grace on the Sex.</P>
<P>A Con&s;ultation was now entered into, how to proceed in order to di&s;cover the Mother. A Scrutiny was fir&s;t made into the Characters of the female Ser|vants of the Hou&s;e, who were all acquitted by Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> and with apparent Merit; for &s;he had col|lected them her&s;elf, and perhaps it would be difficult to find &s;uch another Set of Scare-crows.</P>
<P>The next Step was to examine among the Inha|bitants
<PB N="15" REF="30">
of the Pari&s;h; and this was referred to Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who was to enquire with all imaginable Diligence, and to make her Report in the After|noon.</P>
<P>Matters being thus &s;ettled, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> with|drew to his Study, as was his Cu&s;tom, and left the Child to his Si&s;ter, who, at his De&s;ire, had under|taken the Care of it.</P>

<P><HI>Containing a few common Matters, with a very uncommon Ob&s;ervation upon them.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN her Ma&s;ter departed, Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> &s;tood &s;ilent, expecting her Cue from Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget;</HI> for as to what had pa&s;t before her Ma&s;ter, the prudent Hou&s;e-keeper by no means relied upon it, as &s;he had often known the Sentiments of the Lady in her Brother's Ab&s;ence to differ greatly from tho&s;e which &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed in his Pre&s;ence. Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> did not, however &s;uffer her to conti|nue long in this doubtful Situation; for having looked &s;ome time earne&s;tly at the Child, as it lay a&s;leep in the Lap of Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> the good Lady could not forbear giving it a hearty Ki&s;s, at the &s;ame time declaring her&s;elf wonderfully plea&s;ed with its Beauty and Innocence. Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> no &s;ooner ob&s;erved this, than &s;he fell to &s;queezing and ki&s;&s;ing with as great Raptures as &s;ometimes in&s;pire the &s;age Dame of forty and five towards a youthful and vigorous Bridegroom, crying out in a &s;hrill Voice, 'O the dear little Creature, the dear, &s;weet, pret|ty Creature! well, I vow, it is as fine a Boy as ever was &s;een!'</P>
<P>The&s;e Exclamations continued 'till they were interrupted by the Lady, who now proceeded to
<PB N="16" REF="31">
execute the Commi&s;&s;ion given her by her Brother, and gave Orders for providing all Nece&s;&s;aries for the Child, appointing a very good Room in the Hou&s;e for his Nur&s;ery. Her Orders were indeed &s;o liberal, that had it been a Child of her own, &s;he could not have exceeded them; but le&s;t the virtu|ous Reader may condemn her for &s;hewing too great Regard to a ba&s;e-born Infant, to which all Charity is condemned by Law as irreligious, we think pro|per to ob&s;erve, that &s;he concluded the whole with &s;ay|ing, 'Since it was her Brother's Whim to adopt the little Brat, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed little Ma&s;ter mu&s;t be treated with great Tenderne&s;s; for her part, &s;he could not help thinking it was an Encouragement to Vice; but that &s;he knew too much of the Ob&s;ti|nacy of Mankind to oppo&s;e any of their ridiculous Humours.'</P>
<P>With Reflections of this nature, &s;he u&s;ually, as hath been hinted, accompany'd every Act of Com|pliance with her Brother's Inclinations; and &s;urely nothing could more contribute to heighten the Me|rit of this Compliance, than a Declaration that &s;he knew at the &s;ame time the Folly and Unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Inclinations to which &s;he &s;ubmitted. Tacit Obedience implies no Force upon the Will, and con&s;equently may be ea&s;ily, and without any Pains pre&s;erved; but when a Wife, a Child, a Relation, or a Friend, performs what we de&s;ire, with Grumbling, and Reluctance, with Expre&s;&s;i|ons of Di&s;like and Di&s;&s;atisfaction, the manife&s;t Difficulty which they undergo, mu&s;t greatly en|hance the Obligation.</P>
<P>As this is one of tho&s;e deep Ob&s;ervations which very few Readers can be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of mak|ing them&s;elves, I have thought proper to lend them my A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but this is a Favour rarely to be ex|pected in the Cour&s;e of my Work. Indeed I &s;hall

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Mrs.</HI> Deborah <HI>is introduced into the Pari&s;h, with a Simile. A &s;hort Account of</HI> Jenny Jones, <HI>with the Difficulties and Di&s;couragements which may attend young Women in the Pur&s;uit of Learning.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MRS. <HI>Deborah,</HI> having di&s;po&s;ed of the Child according to the Will of her Ma&s;ter, now prepared to vi&s;it tho&s;e Habitations which were &s;up|po&s;ed to conceal its Mother.</P>
<P>Not otherwi&s;e than when a Kite, tremendous Bird, is beheld by the feathered Generation &s;oar|ing aloft, and hovering over their Heads, the amorous Dove, and every innocent little Bird &s;pread wide the Alarm, and fly trembling to their Hiding-places. He proudly beats the Air, con&s;ci|ous of his Dignity, and meditates intended Mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>So when the Approach of Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> was proclaimed through the Street, all the Inhabitants ran trembling into their Hou&s;es, each Matron dread|ing le&s;t the Vi&s;it &s;hould fall to her Lot. She with &s;tately Steps proudly advances over the Field, aloft &s;he bears her tow'ring Head, filled with Conceit of her own Pre-eminence, and Schemes to effect her intended Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The &s;agacious Reader will not, from this Si|mile, imagine the&s;e poor People had any Appre|hen&s;ion of the De&s;ign with which Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> was now coming towards them; but as the great Beau|ty of the Simile may po&s;&s;ibly &s;leep the&s;e hundred
<PB N="18" REF="33">
Years, till &s;ome future Commentator &s;hall take this Work in hand, I think proper to lend the Reader a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance in this Place.</P>
<P>It is my Intention therefore to &s;ignify, that as it is the Nature of a Kite to devour little Birds, &s;o is it the Nature of &s;uch Per&s;ons as Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> to in&s;ult and tyrannize over little People. This being indeed the Means which they u&s;e to recompen&s;e to them&s;elves their extreme Servility and Conde&s;cen|&s;ion to their Superiors; for nothing can be more rea&s;onable, than that Slaves and Flatterers &s;hould exact the &s;ame Taxes on all below them, which they them&s;elves pay to all above them.</P>
<P>Whenever Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> had had Occa&s;ion to exert any extraordinary Conde&s;cen&s;ion to Mrs. <HI>Bridget,</HI> and by that means had a little &s;owered her natural Di&s;po&s;ition, it was u&s;ual with her to walk forth among the&s;e People, in order to refine her Temper, by venting, and, as it were, purging off all ill Humours; on which Account, &s;he was by no means a welcome Vi&s;itant; to &s;ay the Truth, &s;he was univer&s;ally hated and dreaded by them all.</P>
<P>On her Arrival in this Place, &s;he went immedi|ately to the Habitation of an elderly Matron; to whom, as this Matron had the good Fortune to re&s;emble her&s;elf in the Comeline&s;s of her Per&s;on, as well as in her Age, &s;he had generally been more favourable than to any of the re&s;t. To this Woman &s;he imparted what had happened, and the De&s;ign upon which &s;he was come thither that Morning. The&s;e two began pre&s;ently to &s;cruti|nize the Characters of the &s;everal young Girls, who lived in any of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, and at la&s;t fixed their &s;tronge&s;t Su&s;picion on one <HI>Jenny Jones,</HI> who they both agreed was the likelie&s;t Per&s;on to have com|mitted this Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="34">
This <HI>Jenny Jones</HI> was no very comely Girl, ei|ther in her Face or Per&s;on; but Nature had &s;ome|what compen&s;ated the Want of Beauty with what is generally more e&s;teemed by tho&s;e Ladies, who&s;e Judgment is arrived at Years of perfect Maturity; for &s;he had given her a very uncommon Share of Under&s;tanding. This Gift <HI>Jenny</HI> had a good deal improved by Erudition. She had lived &s;everal Years a Servant with a Schoolma&s;ter, who di&s;cover|ing a great Quickne&s;s of Parts in the Girl, and an extraordinary De&s;ire of Learning, (for every lei&s;ure Hour &s;he was always found reading in the Books of the Scholars) had the Good-nature, or Folly, which the Reader plea&s;es to call it, to in&s;truct her &s;o far, that &s;he obtained a very competent Skill in the Latin Language, and was perhaps as good a Scholar as mo&s;t of the young Men of Quality of the Age. This Advantage, however, like mo&s;t others of an extraordinary Kind, was attended with &s;ome &s;mall Inconveniencies: For as it is not to be wondered at, that a young Woman &s;o well accom|pli&s;hed &s;hould have lIttle Reli&s;h for the Society of tho&s;e whom Fortune had made her Equals, but whom Education had rendered &s;o much her Infe|riors; &s;o is it Matter of no greater A&s;toni&s;hment, that this Superiority in <HI>Jenny,</HI> together with that Behaviour which is its certain Con&s;equence, &s;hould produce among the others &s;ome little Envy and ill-will towards her; and the&s;e had perhaps &s;ecretly burnt in the Bo&s;oms of her Neighbours, ever &s;ince her Return from her Service.</P>
<P>Their Envy did not however di&s;play it&s;elf openly, till poor <HI>Jenny,</HI> to the Surprize of every Body, and to the Vexation of all the young Women in the&s;e Parts, had publickly &s;hone forth on a <HI>Sunday</HI> in a new Silk Gown, with a laced Cap, and other proper Appendages to the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="35">
The Flame, which had before lain in Embrio, now bur&s;t forth. <HI>Jenny</HI> had, by her Learning, en|crea&s;ed her own Pride, which none of her Neigh|bours were kind enough to feed with the Honour &s;he &s;eemed to demand; and now, in&s;tead of Re|&s;pect and Adoration, &s;he gained nothing but Ha|tred and Abu&s;e, by her Finery. The whole Pa|ri&s;h declared &s;he could not come hone&s;tly by &s;uch Things; and Parents, in&s;tead of wi&s;hing their Daughters the &s;ame, felicitated them&s;elves that their Children had them not.</P>
<P>Hence perhaps it was, that the good Woman fir&s;t mentioned the Name of this poor Girl to Mrs. <HI>Wilkins;</HI> but there was another Circum&s;tance that confirmed the latter in her Su&s;picion: For <HI>Jenny</HI> had lately been often at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e. She had officiated as Nur&s;e to Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> in a Violent Fit of Illne&s;s, and had &s;at up many Nights with that Lady; be&s;ides which, &s;he had been &s;een there the very Day before Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Return, by Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> her&s;elf, tho' that &s;agacious Per&s;on had not at fir&s;t conceived any Su&s;picion of her on that Account: For, as &s;he her&s;elf &s;aid, 'She had always e&s;teemed <HI>Jenny</HI> as a very &s;ober Girl, (tho' indeed &s;he knew very little of her) and had rather &s;u&s;pected &s;ome of tho&s;e wanton Trollops, who gave them&s;elves Airs, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they thought them&s;elves hand&s;ome.'</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> was now &s;ummoned to appear in Per&s;on be|fore Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> which &s;he immediately did. When Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> putting on the Gravity of a Judge, with &s;omewhat more than his Au&s;terity, began an Oration with the Words 'You audacious Strum|pet,' in which &s;he proceeded rather to pa&s;s Sen|tence on the Pri&s;ouer, than to accu&s;e her.</P>
<P>Tho' Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> was fully &s;atisfied of the Guilt of <HI>Jenny,</HI> for the Rea&s;on above &s;hewn, it is
<PB N="21" REF="36">
po&s;&s;ible Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> might have required &s;ome &s;tronger Evidence to have convicted her; but &s;he &s;aved her Accu&s;ers any &s;uch Trouble, by freely confe&s;&s;ing the whole Fact with which &s;he was charged.</P>
<P>This Confe&s;&s;ion, tho' delivered rather in Terms of Contrition, as it appeared, did not at all molli|fy Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> who now pronounced a &s;econd Judgment again&s;t her, in more opprobrious Lan|guage than before; nor had it any better Succe&s;s with the By-&s;tanders, who were now grown very numerous. Many of them cried out, 'They thought what Madam's Silk Gown would end in;' others &s;peak &s;arca&s;tically of her Learning. Not a &s;ingle Female was pre&s;ent, but found &s;ome Means of expre&s;&s;ing her Abhorrence of poor <HI>Jenny;</HI> who bore all very patiently, except the Malice of one Woman, who reflected upon her Per&s;on, and to&s;&s;ing upon her No&s;e, &s;aid, 'The Man mu&s;t have a good Stomach, who would give Silk Gowns for &s;uch Sort of Trumpery.' <HI>Jenny</HI> re|plied to this, with a Bitterne&s;s which might have &s;urprized a judicious Per&s;on, who had ob&s;erved the Tranquillity with which &s;he bore all the Affronts to her Cha&s;tity; but her Patience was tired out: For this is a Virtue which is very apt to be fa|tigued by Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> having &s;ucceeded beyond her hopes in her Enquiry, returned with much Triumph, and at the appointed Hour made a faithful Report to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who was much &s;urprized at the Relation; for he had heard of the extraordinary Parts and Improvements of this Girl, whom he intended to have given in Marriage, together with a &s;mall Living, to a neighbouring Curate. His Concern therefore upon this Occa&s;ion, was at lea&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="37">
equal to the Satisfaction which appeared in Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> and to many Readers may &s;eem much more rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Bridget</HI> ble&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, and &s;aid, 'For her Part, &s;he &s;hould never hereafter entertain a good Opinion of any Woman:' For <HI>Jenny</HI> had like|wi&s;e had the Happine&s;s of being much in her good Graces.</P>
<P>The prudent Hou&s;ekeeper was again di&s;patched to bring the unhappy Culprit before Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> in order, not, as it was hoped by &s;ome and expected by all, to be &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction; but to receive whole&s;ome Admonition and Reproof, which tho&s;e who reli&s;h that kind of In&s;tructive Writing, may peru&s;e in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing &s;uch grave Matter, that the Reader can|not laugh once through the whole Chapter, unle&s;s peradventure he &s;hould laugh at the Author,</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN <HI>Jenny</HI> appeared, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> took her into his Study, and &s;poke to her as follows.</P>
<P>'You know, Child, it is in my Power, as a Magi&s;trate, to puni&s;h you very rigorou&s;ly for what you have done; and you will perhaps be the more apt to fear I &s;hould execute that Pow|er, becau&s;e you have, in a manner, laid your' Sins at my Door.</P>
<P>'But perhaps this is one Rea&s;on which hath determined me to act in a milder Manner with you: For, as no private Re&s;entment &s;hould ever influence a Magi&s;trate, I will be &s;o far from con|&s;idering your having depo&s;ited the Infant in my Hou&s;e, as an Aggavation of your Offence, that
<PB N="23" REF="38">
I will &s;uppo&s;e, in your Favour, this to have proceeded from a natural Affection to your Child; &s;ince you might have &s;ome Hopes to &s;ee it thus better provided for, than was in the Pow|er of your&s;elf, or its wicked Father, to provide for it. I &s;hould indeed have been highly offend|ed with you, had you expo&s;ed the little Wretch in the manner of &s;ome inhuman Mothers, who &s;eem no le&s;s to have abandoned their Humanity, than to have parted with their Cha&s;tity. It is the other Part of your Offence therefore upon which I intend to admoni&s;h you, I mean the Vi|olation of your Cha&s;tity. A Crime, however lightly treated it may be by debauched Per&s;ons, very heinous in it&s;elf, and very dreadful in its' Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>'The heinous Nature of this Offence mu&s;t be apparent to every Chri&s;tian, ina&s;much as it is committed in the Defiance of the Laws of our Religion, and of the expre&s;s Commands of him' who founded that Religion.</P>
<P>'And here its Con&s;equences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what can be more &s;o, than to incur the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, by the Breach of the Divine Commands; and that in an In&s;tance, again&s;t which the highe&s;t Vengeance is &s;pecifi|cally' denounced.</P>
<P>'But the&s;e Things, tho' too little, I am a|fraid, regarded, are &s;o plain, that Mankind, how|ever they may want to be reminded, can never need Information on this Head. A Hint there|fore to awaken your Sen&s;e of this Matter &s;hall &s;uffice; for I would in&s;pire you with Repentance,' and not drive you to De&s;peration.</P>
<P>'There are other Con&s;equences, not indeed &s;o dreadful or replete with Horror as this; and yet &s;uch, as if attentively con&s;idered, mu&s;t, one
<PB N="23" REF="39">
would think, deter all, of your Sex at lea&s;t, from' the Commi&s;&s;ion of this Crime.</P>
<P>'For by it you are rendered infamous, and dri|ven, like Lepers of old, out of Society; at lea&s;t from the Society of all but wicked and repro|bate Per&s;ons; for no other will a&s;&s;ociate with you.</P>
<P>'If you have Fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying them; if you have none, you are di&s;abled from acquiring any, nay almo&s;t of procuring your Su&s;tenance; for no Per&s;ons of Character will receive you into their Hou&s;es. Thus you are often driven by Nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf into a State of Shame and Mi&s;ery, which una|voidably ends in the De&s;truction of both Body' and Soul.</P>
<P>'Can any Plea&s;ure compen&s;ate the&s;e Evils? Can any Temptation have Sophi&s;try and Delu&s;ion &s;trong enough to per&s;uade you to &s;o &s;imple a Bargain? Or can any carnal Appetite &s;o overpow|er your Rea&s;on, or &s;o totally lay it a&s;leep, as to prevent your flying with Affright and Terror from a Crime which carries &s;uch Puni&s;hment al|ways' with it.</P>
<P>'How ba&s;e and mean mu&s;t that Woman be, how void of that Dignity of Mind, and decent Pride, without which we are not worthy the Name of human Creatures, who can bear to level her&s;elf with the lowe&s;t Animal, and to &s;acrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her Heavenly Part, to an Appetite which &s;he hath in common with the vile&s;t Branch of the Creation! For no Wo|man &s;ure, will plead the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love for an Excu&s;e. This would be to own her&s;elf the meer Tool and Bubble of the Man. Love, however barbarou&s;ly we may corrupt and pervert its mean|ing, as it is a laudable, is a rational Pa&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="25" REF="40">
can never be violent, but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our Enemies, it means not with that &s;ervent Love, which we naturally bear towards our Friends; much le&s;s that we &s;hould &s;acrifice to them our Lives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our Innocence. Now in what Light, but in that of an Enemy, can a rea&s;onable Woman regard the Man, who &s;olicits her to entail on her&s;elf all the Mi&s;ery I have above de&s;cribed, and who would purcha&s;e to him&s;elf a &s;hort, trivial, contemptible Plea|&s;ure, &s;o greatly at her Expence! For by the Laws of Cu&s;tom the whole Shame, with all its dreadful Con&s;equences, falls entirely upon her. Can Love, which always &s;eeks the good of its Object, attempt to betray a Woman into a Bar|gain, where &s;he is &s;o greatly to be the Lo&s;er? If &s;uch Corrupter, therefore, &s;hould have the Im|pudence to pretend to real Affection for her, ought not the Woman to regard him, not only as an Enemy, but as the wor&s;t of all Enemies; a fal&s;e, de&s;igning, treacherous, pretended Friend, who intends not only to debauch her Body, but' her Under&s;tanding at the &s;ame Time?</P>
<P>Here <HI>Jenny</HI> expre&s;&s;ing great Concern, <HI>Allwor|thy</HI> pau&s;ed a Moment, and then proceeded: I have talked thus to you, Child, not to in&s;ult you for what is pa&s;t, and irrevocable, but to cau|tion and &s;trengthen you for the future. Nor &s;hould I have taken this Trouble, but from &s;ome Opinion of your good Sen&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the dreadful Slip you have made; and from &s;ome Hopes of your hearty Repentance, which are founded on the Openne&s;s and Sincerity of your Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P> If the&s;e do not deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this Scene of your Shame, where you &s;hall, by being unknown, 'a|void
<PB N="26" REF="41">
the Puni&s;hment which, as I have &s;aid, is allotted to your Crime in this World, and I hope by Repentance, you will avoid the much heavier Sentence denounced again&s;t it in the o|ther. Be a good Girl the re&s;t of your Days, and Want &s;hall be no Motive to your going a&s;tray: And believe me, there is more Plea|&s;ure, even in this World, in an innocent and' virtuous Life, than in one debauched and vicious.</P>
<P>'As to your Child, let no Thoughts concerning it, mole&s;t you; I will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now no|thing remains, but that you inform me who was the wicked Man that &s;educed you; for my An|ger again&s;t him will be much greater than you have experienced upon this Occa&s;ion.'</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> now lifted her Eyes from the Ground, and with a mode&s;t Look, and decent Voice, thus began.</P>
<P>'To know you, Sir, and not love your Good|ne&s;s, would be an Argument of total want of Sen&s;e or Goodne&s;s in any one. In me it would amount to the highe&s;t Ingratitude, not to feel, in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner, the great Degree of Goodne&s;s you have been plea&s;ed to exert on this Occa&s;ion. As to my Concern for what is pa&s;t, I know you will &s;pare my Blu&s;hes the Repetition. My future Conduct will much better declare my Sentiments, than any Profe&s;&s;ions I can now make. I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that I take your Advice much kinder, than your gene|rous Offer with which you concluded it. For as you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, Sir, it is an In&s;tance of your Opinion of my U under&s;tanding'&mdash;Here her Tears flowing apace, &s;he &s;topped a few Mo|ments, and then proceeded thus, 'Indeed, Sir, your Kindne&s;s overcomes me; but I will en|deavour
<PB N="27" REF="42">
to de&s;erve this good Opinion; for if I have the Under&s;tanding you are &s;o kindly plea&s;ed to allow me, &s;uch Advice cannot be thrown a|way upon me. I thank you, Sir, heartily, for your intended Kindne&s;s to my poor helple&s;s Child; he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful for all the Favours you &s;hall &s;hew him. But now, Sir, I mu&s;t on my Knees intreat you, not to per&s;i&s;t in a&s;king me to declare the Father of my Infant. I promi&s;e you faithfully, you &s;hall one Day know; but I am under the mo&s;t &s;olemn Ties and Engagements of Honour, as well as the mo&s;t religious Vows and Pro|te&s;tations, to conceal his Name at this Time. And I know you too well to think you would de|&s;ire I &s;hould &s;acrifice either my Honour or my Religion.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> whom the lea&s;t Mention of the&s;e &s;acred Words was &s;ufficient to &s;tagger, he&s;itated a Moment before he replied, and then told her &s;he had done wrong to enter into &s;uch Engagements to a Villain; but &s;ince &s;he had, he could not in&s;i&s;t on her breaking them. He &s;aid, it was not from a Motive of vain Curio&s;ity he had enquired, but in order to puni&s;h the Fellow; at lea&s;t, that he might not ignorantly confer Favours on the Un|de&s;erving.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Points, <HI>Jenny</HI> &s;atisfied him by the mo&s;t &s;olemn A&s;&s;urances, that the Man was entire|ly out of his Reach, and was neither &s;ubject to his Power, nor in any probability of becoming an Ob|ject of his Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ingenuity of this Behaviour, had gained <HI>Jenny</HI> &s;o much Credit with this worthy Man, that he ea&s;ily believed what &s;he told him: For as &s;he had di&s;dained to excu&s;e her&s;elf by a Lie, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">azarded his farther Di&s;plea&s;ure in her pre&s;ent Si|tuation,
<PB N="28" REF="43">
rather than &s;he would forfeit her Honour, or Integrity, by betraying another, he had but lit|tle Apprehen&s;ion that &s;he would be guilty of Fal&s;|hood towards him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with A&s;&s;urances, that he would very &s;oon remove her out of the Reach of that Obloquy &s;he had incurred, concluding with &s;ome additional Documents, in which he recom|mended Repentance, &s;aying, "Con&s;ider, Child, 'there is one &s;till to reconcile your&s;elf to, who&s;e Favour is of much greater Importance to you than mine.'</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Dialogue between Me&s;dames</HI> Bridget, <HI>and</HI> Debo|rah; <HI>containing more Amu&s;ement, but le&s;s In|&s;truction than the former.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had retired to his Stu|dy with <HI>Jenny Jones,</HI> as hath been &s;een, Mrs. <HI>Bridget,</HI> with the good Hou&s;ekeeper, had be|taken them&s;elves to a Po&s;t next adjoining to the &s;aid Study; whence, through the Conveyance of a Key|hole, they &s;ucked in at their Ears the In&s;tructive Lecture delivered by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> together with the An&s;wers of <HI>Jenny,</HI> and indeed every other Par|ticular which pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>This Hole in her Brother's Study Door, was indeed as well known to Mrs. <HI>Bridget,</HI> and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous Hole in the Wall was by <HI>Thi&s;be</HI> of old. This &s;erved to many good Purpo&s;es. For by &s;uch Means Mrs. <HI>Bridget</HI> became often acquainted with her Brothers Inclinations, without giving him the Trouble of repeating them to her. It is true, &s;ome Inconveniencies attended this Intercour&s;e, and &s;he
<PB N="29" REF="44">
had &s;ometimes Rea&s;on to cry out with <HI>Thi&s;be,</HI> in <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> 'O wicked, wicked Wall!' For as Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was a Ju&s;tice of Peace, certain Things occured in Examinations concerning the Ba&s;tards, and &s;uch like, which are apt to give great Offence to the cha&s;te Ears of Virgins, e&s;pecially when they approach the Age of forty, as was the Ca&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Bridget.</HI> However, &s;he had, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the Advantage of concealing her Blu&s;hes from the Eyes of Men, and <Q><HI>De non ap|parentibus, et non exi&s;tentibus eadem e&s;t ratio.</HI></Q> In <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> <Q>'When a Woman is not &s;een to blu&s;h, &s;he doth not blu&s;h at all.'</Q></P>
<P>Both the good Women kept &s;trict Silence dur|ring the whole Scene between Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and the Girl; but as &s;oon as it was ended, and that Gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> could not help exclaiming again&s;t the Clemency of her Ma&s;ter, and e&s;pecially again&s;t his &s;uffering her to conceal the Father of the Child, which &s;he &s;wore &s;he would have out of her before the Sun &s;et.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words Mrs. <HI>Bridget</HI> di&s;compo&s;ed her Features with a Smile; (a Thing very unu&s;ual to her) Not that I would have my Reader imagine, that this was one of tho&s;e wanton Smiles, which <HI>Homer</HI> would have you conceive came from <HI>Venus,</HI> when he calls her the laughter-loving Godde&s;s; nor was it one of tho&s;e Smiles, which Lady <HI>Se|raphina</HI> &s;hoots from the Stage-Box, and which <HI>Venus</HI> would quit her Immortality to be able to equal. No, this was rather one of tho&s;e Smiles, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have come from the dimpled Cheecks of the augu&s;t <HI>Ty&s;iphone,</HI> or from one of the Mi&s;&s;es her Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a Smile then, and with a Voice, &s;weet as the Evening Breeze of <HI>Boreas</HI> in the plea&s;ant Month of <HI>November,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Bridget</HI> gent|ly
<PB N="30" REF="45">
reproved the Curio&s;ity of Mrs. <HI>Deborah,</HI> a Vice with which it &s;eems the latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed again&s;t with great Bitterne&s;s, adding, 'that among all her Faults, &s;he thanked Heaven, her Enemies could not accu&s;e her of prying into the Affairs of other People.'</P>
<P>She then proceeded to commend the Honour and Spirit with which <HI>Jenny</HI> had acted. She &s;aid, &s;he could not help agreeing with her Brother, that there was &s;ome Merit in the Sincerity of her Confe&s;&s;ion, and in her Integrity to her Lover. That &s;he had always thought her a very good Girl, and doubted not but &s;he had been &s;e|duced by &s;ome Ra&s;cal, who had been infinitely more to blame than her&s;elf, and very probably had prevailed with her by a Promi&s;e of Marriage, or &s;ome other treacherous Proceeding.</P>
<P>This Behaviour of Mrs. <HI>Bridget</HI> greatly &s;ur|prized Mrs. <HI>Deborah;</HI> for this well-bred Woman &s;eldom opened her Lips either to her Ma&s;ter or his Si&s;ter, 'till &s;he had fir&s;t &s;ounded their Incli|nations, with which her Sentiments were always &s;trictly con&s;onant. Here, however, &s;he thought &s;he might have launched forth with Safety; and the &s;agacious Reader will not perhaps accu&s;e her of want of &s;ufficient Foreca&s;t in &s;o doing, but will rather admire with what wonderful Celerity &s;he tacked about, when &s;he found her&s;elf &s;teering a wrong Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>'Nay Madam,' &s;aid this able Woman, and truly great Politician, 'I mu&s;t own I cannot help admiring the Girl's Spirit, as well as your La|dy&s;hip. And, as your 'Lady&s;hip &s;ays, if &s;he was deceived by &s;ome wicked Man, the poor Wretch is to be pitied. And to be &s;ure, as your Lady&s;hip &s;ays, the Girl hath always appeared
<PB N="31" REF="46">
like a good, hone&s;t, plain Girl, and not vain of her Face, for&s;ooth, as &s;ome wanton Hu&s;&s;eys in' the Neighbourhood are.</P>
<P>'You &s;ay true, <HI>Deborah,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Bridget,</HI> if the Girl had been one of tho&s;e vain Trollops, of which we have too many in the Pari&s;h, I &s;hould have condemned my Brother for his Le|nity towards her. I &s;aw two Farmers Daugh|ters at Church, the other Day, with bare Necks. I prote&s;t they &s;hock'd me. If Wenches will hang out Lures for Fellows, it is no matter what they &s;uffer. I dete&s;t &s;uch Creatures; and it would be much better for them, that their Faces had been &s;eamed with the Small-Pox; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never &s;aw any of this wan|ton Behaviour in poor <HI>Jenny;</HI> &s;ome artful Villain, I am convinced, hath betrayed, nay perhaps forc'd her; and I pity the poor Wretch with all my Heart.'</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> approved all the&s;e Sentiments, and the Dialogue concluded with a general and bitter Invective again&s;t Beauty, and with many compa&s;&s;ionate Con&s;iderations for all hone&s;t, plain Girls, who are deluded by the wicked Arts of deceitful Men.</P>

<P><HI>Containing Matters which will &s;urprize the Reader.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JENNY</HI> returned home well plea&s;ed with the Reception &s;he had met with from Mr. <HI>All|worthy,</HI> who&s;e Indulgence to her &s;he indu&s;trou&s;ly made public; partly perhaps as a Sacrifice to her own Pride, and partly from the more prudent Motive of reconciling her Neighbours to her, and &s;ilencing their Clamours.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="47">
But though this latter View; if &s;he indeed had it, may appear rea&s;onable enough, yet the Event did not an&s;wer her Expectation; for when &s;he was convened before the Ju&s;tice, and it, was univer&s;|ally apprehended, that the Hou&s;e of Correction would have been her Fate; tho' &s;ome of the young Women cry'd out, 'it was good e|nough for her,' and diverted them&s;elves with the Thoughts of her beating Hemp in a Silk Gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her Condition: But when it was known in what man|ner Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had behaved, the Tide turned again&s;t her. One &s;aid, ''I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Madam hath had good Luck.' A &s;econd cry'd, 'See what it is to be a Favourite.' A third,' Ay, this comes of her Learning.' Every Per&s;on made &s;ome malicious Comment or other, on the Occa|&s;ion; and reflected on the Partiality of the Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of the&s;e People, may appear impolitic, and ungrateful to the Reader, who con|&s;iders the Power, and the Benevolence of Mr. <HI>Allworthy:</HI> But as to his Power, he never u&s;ed it; and as to his Benevolence, he exerted &s;o much, that he had thereby di&s;obliged all his Neighbours: For it is a Secret well known to great Men, that by conferring an Obligation, they do not always procure a Friend, but are certain of creating many Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> was, however, by the Care and Goodne&s;s of Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> &s;oon removed out of the Reach of Reproach; when Malice, being no longer able to vent its Rage on her, began to &s;eek another Object of its Bitterne&s;s, and this was no le&s;s than Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf; for a Whi&s;per &s;oon went abroad, that he him&s;elf was the Father of the foundling Child.</P>
<P>This Suppo&s;ition &s;o well reconciled his Conduct
<PB N="33" REF="48">
to the general Opinion, that it met with univer&s;al A&s;&s;ent; and the Outery again&s;t his Lenity &s;oon be|gan to take another Turn, and was changed into an Invective again&s;t his Cruelty to the poor Girl. Very grave and good Women exclaimed again&s;t Men who begot Children and then di&s;owned them. Nor were there wanting &s;ome, who, after the Departure of <HI>Jenny,</HI> in&s;inuated, that &s;he was &s;pirit|ed away with a De&s;ign too black to be mentioned, and who gave frequent Hints, that a legal Inquiry ought to be made into the whole Matter, and that &s;ome People &s;hould be forced to produce the Girl.</P>
<P>The&s;e Calumnies might have probably produced ill Con&s;equences (at the lea&s;t might have occa&s;ioned &s;ome Trouble,) to a Per&s;on of a more doubtful and &s;u&s;picious Character than Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was ble&s;&s;ed with; but in his Ca&s;e they had no &s;uch Effect; and, being heartily de&s;pi&s;ed by him, they &s;erved only to afford an innocent Amu&s;ement to the good Go&s;|&s;ips of the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>But as we cannot po&s;&s;ibly divine what Com|plexion our Reader may be of, and as it will be &s;ome Time before he will hear any more of <HI>Jenny,</HI> we think proper to give him a very early Intimation, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was, and will hereafter appear to be, ab&s;olutely innocent of any criminal Intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an Error in Politics, by tempering Ju&s;tice with Mercy, and by refu&s;ing to gratify the good natured Di&s;po&s;ition of the Mob, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever this Word occurs in our Writing, it intends Per&s;ons without Virtue, or Sen&s;e, in all Stations, and many of the highe&s;t Rank are often meant by it.</NOTE> with an Object for their Compa&s;&s;ion to work on in the Per&s;on of poor <HI>Jen|ny,</HI> whom, in order to pity, they de&s;ired to have
<PB N="34" REF="49">
&s;een &s;acrificed to Ruin and Infamy by a &s;hameful correction in <HI>Bridewel.</HI></P>
<P>So far from complying with this their Inclination, by which all Hopes of Reformation would have been aboli&s;hed, and even the Gate &s;hut again&s;t her, if her own Inclinations &s;hould ever hereafter lead her to chu&s;e the Road of Virtue, Mr. <HI>Allworhty</HI> ra|ther cho&s;e to encourage the Girl to return thither by the only po&s;&s;ible Means; for too true I am a|fraid it is, that many Women have become aban|doned, and have &s;unk to the la&s;t Degree of Vice by being unable to retrieve the fir&s;t Slip. This will be, I am afraid, always the Ca&s;e while they remain among their former Acquaintance; it was there|fore wi&s;ely done by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> to remove <HI>Jenny</HI> to a Place where &s;he might enjoy the Plea|&s;ure of Reputation, after having ta&s;ted the ill Con|&s;equences of lo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>To this Place therefore, wherever it was, we will wi&s;h her a good Journey, and for the pre&s;ent take leave of her, and of the little Foundling her Child, having Matters of much higher Importance to communicate to the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Ho&s;pitality of</HI> Allworthy; <HI>with a &s;hort Sketch of the Characters of two Brothers, a Doctor, and a Captain, who were entertained by that Gentle|man.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEITHER Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e, nor his Heart, were &s;hut again&s;t any Part of Mankind, but they were both more particularly open to Men of Merit. To &s;ay the Truth, this was the only Hou&s;e in the Kingdom where you was &s;ure to gain a Dinner by de&s;erving it.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="50">
Above all others, Men of Genius and Learning &s;hared the principal Place in his Favour; and in the&s;e he had much Di&s;cernment: For though he had mi&s;&s;ed the Advantage of a learned Education, yet being ble&s;t with va&s;t natural Abilities, he had &s;o well profited by a vigorous, though late Application to Letters, and by much Conver&s;ation with Men of Eminence in this Way, that he was him&s;elf a very competent Judge in mo&s;t kind of Literature.</P>
<P>It is no Wonder that in an Age when this kind of Merit is &s;o little in Fa&s;hion, and &s;o &s;lenderly provided for, that Per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it &s;hould ve|ry eagerly flock to a Place where they were &s;ure of being received with great Complai&s;ance; indeed where they might enjoy almo&s;t the &s;ame Advantages of a liberal Fortune as if they were entitled to it in their own Right; for Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was not one of tho&s;e generous Per&s;ons, who are ready mo&s;t bountifully to be&s;tow Meat, Drink, and Lodging on Men of Wit and Learning, for which they ex|pect no other Return but Entertainment, In&s;truc|tion, Flattery, and Sub&s;erviency; in a Word, that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould be enrolled in the Number of Dome&s;tics, without wearing their Ma&s;ter's Cloaths, or receiving Wages.</P>
<P>On the contrary, every Per&s;on in this Hou&s;e was perfect Ma&s;ter of his own Time: and as he might at his Plea&s;ure &s;atisfy all his Appetites within the Re&s;trictions only of Law, Virtue and Religion; &s;o he might, if his Health required, or his Incli|nation prompted him to Temperance, or even to Ab&s;tinence, ab&s;ent him&s;elf from any Meals, or re|tire from them whenever he was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, with|out even a Solicitation to the contrary: For indeed &s;uch Solicitations from Superiors always favour ve|ry &s;trongly of Commands. But all here were free from &s;uch Impertinence, not only tho&s;e, who&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="51">
Company is in all other Places e&s;teemed a Favour from their Equality of Fortune, but even tho&s;e who&s;e indigent Circum&s;tances make &s;uch an eleemo|&s;ynary Abode convenient to them, and who are therefore le&s;s welcome to a great Man's Table be|cau&s;e they &s;tand in need of it.</P>
<P>Among others of this Kind was Dr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> a Gentleman who had the Misfortune of lo&s;ing the Advantage of great Talents by the Ob&s;tinacy of a Father, who would breed him to a Profe&s;&s;ion he di&s;liked. In Obedience to this Ob&s;tinacy the Doc|tor had in his Youth been obliged to &s;tudy Phy&s;ick, or rather to &s;ay he &s;tudied it; for in reality Books of this Kind were almo&s;t the only ones with which he was unacquainted; and unfortunately for him, the Doctor was Ma&s;ter of almo&s;t every other Science but that by which he was to get his Bread; the Con&s;equence of which was, that the Doctor at the Age of Forty had no Bread to eat.</P>
<P>Such a Per&s;on as this was certain to find a Wel|come at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Table, to whom Misfor|tunes were ever a Recommendation, when they were derived from the Folly or Villany of others, and not of the unfortunate Per&s;on him&s;elf. Be&s;ides this negative Merit, the Doctor had one po&s;itive Recommendation. This was a great Appearance of Religion. Whether his Religion was real, or con&s;i&s;ted only in Appearance, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, as I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any Touch-&s;tone, which can di&s;tingui&s;h the true from the fal&s;e.</P>
<P>If this Part of his Character plea&s;ed Mr. <HI>All|worthy,</HI> it delighted Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget.</HI> She engaged him in many religious Controver&s;ies; on which Occa&s;ions &s;he con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ed great Satisfaction in the Doctor's Knowledge, and not much le&s;s in the Compliments which he frequently be&s;towed on her own. To &s;ay the Truth, &s;he had read much
<PB N="37" REF="52">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the Neighbouring Curates. Indeed her Conver|&s;ation was &s;o pure, her Looks &s;o &s;age, and her whole Deportment &s;o grave and &s;olemn, that &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;erve the Name of Saint equally with her Name-&s;ake, or with any other Female in the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Kalendar.</P>
<P>As Sympathies of all Kinds are apt to beget Love, &s;o Experience teaches us that none have a more direct Tendency this Way than tho&s;e of a religious Kind between Per&s;ons of different Sexes. The Doctor found him&s;elf &s;o agreeable to Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> that he now began to lament an unfor|tunate Accident which had happened to him aboutten Years before; namely, his Marriage with another Woman, who was not only &s;till alive, but what was wor&s;e, known to be &s;o by Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> This was a fatal Bar to that Happine&s;s which he otherwi&s;e &s;aw &s;ufficient Probability of obtaining with this young Lady; for as to criminal Indul|gences, he certainly never thought of them. This was owing either to his Religion, as is mo&s;t pro|bable, or to the Purity of his Pa&s;&s;ion, which was fixed on tho&s;e Things, which Matrimony only, and not criminal Corre&s;pondence, could put him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, or could give him any Title to.</P>
<P>He had not long ruminated on the&s;e Matters be|fore it recurred to his Memory that he had a Bro|ther who was under no &s;uch unhappy Incapacity. This Brother he made no doubt would &s;ucceed; for he di&s;cerned, as he thought, an Inclination to Marriage in the Lady; and the Reader perhaps, when he hears the Brother's Qualifications, will not blame the Confidence which he entertained of his Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was about 35 Years of Age. He was of a middle Size, and what is called well
<PB N="38" REF="53">
built. He had a Scar on his Forehead, which did not &s;o much injure his Beauty, as it denoted his Valour (for he was a half-pay Officer.) He had good Teeth, and &s;omething affable, when he plea&s;|ed, in his Smile; though naturally his Countenance, as well as his Air and Voice, had much of Rough|ne&s;s in it, yet he could at any Time depo&s;ite this, and appear all Gentlene&s;s and good Humour. He was not ungenteel, nor entirely void of Wit, and in his Youth had abounded in Spriteline&s;s, which, though he had lately put on a more &s;erious Charac|ter, he could, when he plea&s;ed, re&s;ume.</P>
<P>He had, as well as the Doctor, an Academic Education; for his Father had, with the &s;ame Pa|ternal Authority we have mentioned before, de|creed him for holy Orders; but as the old Gentle|man died before he was ordained, he cho&s;e the Church Military, and preferred the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hop's.</P>
<P>He had purcha&s;ed the Po&s;t of Lieutenant of Dra|goons, and afterwards came to be a Captain; but having quarrelled with his Colonel, was by his In|tere&s;t obliged to &s;ell; from which Time he had entirely ru&s;ticated him&s;elf, had betaken him&s;elf to &s;tudying the Scriptures, and was not a little &s;u&s;pect|ed of an Inclination to <HI>Methodi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eemed therefore not unlikely that &s;uch a Per|&s;on &s;hould &s;ucceed with a Lady of &s;o Saint-like a Di&s;po&s;ition, and who&s;e Inclinations were no other|wi&s;e engaged than to the married State in general; but why the Doctor, who certainly had no great Friend&s;hip for his Brother, &s;hould for his Sake think of making &s;o ill a Return to the Ho&s;pitality of <HI>All|worthy,</HI> is a Matter not &s;o ea&s;y to be accounted for.</P>
<P>Is it that &s;ome Natures delight in Evil, as others are thought to delight in Virtue? Or is there a Plea&s;ure in being acce&s;&s;ary to a Theft when we cannot
<PB N="39" REF="54">
commit it our&s;elves? Or La&s;tly, (which Experience &s;eems to make probably) have we a &s;atisfaction in aggrandizing our Families, even tho' we have not the lea&s;t Love or Re&s;pect for them?</P>
<P>Whether any of the&s;e Motives operated on the Doctor we will not determine; but &s;o the Fact was. He &s;ent for his Brother, and ea&s;ily found Means to introduce him at <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s as a Per&s;on who in|tended only a &s;hort Vi&s;it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Captain had not been in the Hou&s;e a Week before the Doctor had Rea&s;on to felicitate him&s;elf on his Di&s;cernment. The Captain was indeed as great a Ma&s;ter of the Art of Love as <HI>Ovid</HI> was for|merly. He had be&s;ides received proper Hints from his Brother, which he failed not to improve to the be&s;t Advantage.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT hath been ob&s;erved by wi&s;e Men or Women, I forget which, that all Per&s;ons are doomed to be in Love once in their Lives. No particular Sea&s;on is, as I remember, a&s;&s;igned for this; but the Age at which Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> was arrived &s;eems to me as proper a Period as any to be fixed on for this Purpo&s;e: It often indeed happens much earlier; but when it doth not, I have ob&s;erved, it &s;eldom or never fails about this Time. Moreover, we may remark that at this Sea&s;on Love is of a more &s;erious and &s;teady Nature than what &s;ome times &s;hews it&s;elf in the younger Parts of Life. The Love of Girls is uncertain, capricious, and

&s;o fooli&s;h that we cannot always di&s;cover what the young Lady would be at; nay, it may almo&s;t be doubted, whether &s;he always knows this her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now we are never at a Lo&s;s to di&s;cern this in Women about Forty; for as &s;uch grave, &s;erious and experienced Ladies well know their own Meaning, &s;o it is always very ea&s;y for a Man of the lea&s;t Sa|gacity to di&s;cover this with the utmo&s;t Certainty.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> is an Example of all the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations. She had not been many Times in the Captain's Company before &s;he was &s;eized with this Pa&s;&s;ion. Nor did &s;he go pining and moping about the Hou&s;e, like a puny fooli&s;h Girl, ignorant of her Di&s;temper: She felt, &s;he knew, and &s;he en|joyed, the plea&s;ing Sen&s;ation, of which, as &s;he was certain it was not only innocent but laudable, &s;he was neither afraid nor a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay the Truth, there is in all Points, great Difference between the rea&s;onable Pa&s;&s;ion which Women at this Age conceive towards Men, and the idle and childi&s;h Liking of a Girl to a Boy, which is often fixed on the Out&s;ide only, and on Things of little Value and no Duration; as on Cherry Cheeks, &s;mall Lily-white Hands, &s;low-black Eyes, flowing Locks, downy Chins, dap|per Shapes, nay &s;ometimes on Charms more worth|le&s;s than the&s;e, and le&s;s the Party's own; &s;uch are the outward Ornaments of the Per&s;on, and for which Men are beholden to the Taylor, the Lace|man, the Perriwigmaker, the Hatter, and the Mil|liner, and not to Nature. Such a Pa&s;&s;ion Girls may well be a&s;hamed, as they generally are, to own either to them&s;elves or to others.</P>
<P>The Love of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> was of another Kind. The Captain owed nothing to any of the&s;e Fop|makers in his Dre&s;s, nor was his Per&s;on much more beholden to Nature. Both his Dre&s;s and
<PB N="41" REF="56">
Per&s;on were &s;uch as, had they appeared in an A&s;|&s;embly, or a Drawing-room, would have been the Contempt and Ridicule of all the fine Ladies there. The former of the&s;e was indeed neat, but plain, coar&s;e, ill-fancied, and out of Fa&s;hion. As for the latter, we have expre&s;sly de&s;cribed it above. So far was the Skin on his Cheeks from being Cherry-coloured, that you could not di&s;cern what the natural Colour of his Cheeks was, they being totally overgrown by a black Beard, which a&s;|cended to his Eyes. His Shape and Limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but &s;o large, that they denoted the Strength rather of a Ploughman than any other. His Shoulders were broad, be|yond all Size, and the Calves of his Legs larger than tho&s;e of a common Chairman. In &s;hort, his whole Per&s;on wanted all that Elegance and Beauty, which is the very rever&s;e of clum&s;y Strength, and which &s;o agreeably &s;ets off mo&s;t of our fine Gen|tlemen; being partly owing to the high Blood of their Ance&s;tors, <HI>viz.</HI> Blood made of rich Sauces and generous Wines, and partly to an early Town Education.</P>
<P>Tho' Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> was a Woman of the great|e&s;t Delicacy of Ta&s;te; yet &s;uch were the Charms of the Captain's Conver&s;ation, that &s;he totally overlooked the Defects of his Per&s;on. She ima|gined, and perhaps very wi&s;ely, that &s;he &s;hould enjoy more agreeable Minutes with the Captain, than with a much prettier Fellow; and forewent the Con&s;ideration of plea&s;ing her Eyes, in order to procure her&s;elf much more &s;olid Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Captain no &s;ooner perceived the Pa&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> in which Di&s;covery he was very quick-&s;ighted, than he faithfully returned it. The Lady, no more than her Lover, was remarkable for Beauty. I would attempt to draw her Picture;
<PB N="42" REF="57">
but this is done already by a more able Ma&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Hogarth</HI> him&s;elf, to whom &s;he &s;at many Years ago, and had been lately exhibited by that Gentle|man in his Print of a Winter's Morning, of which &s;he was no improper Emblem, and may be &s;een walking (for walk &s;he doth in the Print) to <HI>Co|vent-Garden</HI> Church, with a &s;tarved Foot-boy be|hind carrying her Prayer-book.</P>
<P>The Captain likewi&s;e very wi&s;ely preferred the more &s;olid Enjoyments he expected with this La|dy, to the fleeting Charms of Per&s;on. He was one of tho&s;e wi&s;e Men, who regard Beauty in the other Sex as a very worthle&s;s and &s;uperficial Qua|lification; or, to &s;peak more truly, who rather chu&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s every Convenience of Life with an ugly Woman, than a hand&s;ome one without any of tho&s;e Conveniencies. And having a very good Appitite, and but little Nicety, he fancied he &s;hould play his Part very well at the matrimonial Banquet, without the Sauce of Beauty.</P>
<P>To deal plainly with the Reader, the Captain, ever &s;ince his Arrival, at lea&s;t from the Moment his Brother had propo&s;ed the Match to him, long before he had di&s;covered any flattering Symptoms in Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> had been greatly enamoured; that is to &s;ay, of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e and Gar|dens, and of his Lands, Tenements and Heredita|ments; of all which the Captain was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate|ly fond, that he would mo&s;t probably have con|tracted Marriage with them, had he been obliged to have taken the Witch of <HI>Endor</HI> into the Bargain.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> therefore had declared to the Doctor, that he never intended to take a &s;econd Wife, as his Si&s;ter was his neare&s;t Relation, and as the Docter had fi&s;hed out that his Intentions were to make any Child of hers his Heir, which indeed the Law, without his Interpo&s;ition, would
<PB N="43" REF="58">
have done for him; the Doctor and his Brother thought it an Act of Benevolence to give Being to a human Creature, who would be &s;o plentifully provided with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Means of Hap|pine&s;s. The whole Thoughts therefore of both the Brothers, were how to engage the Affections of this amiable Lady.</P>
<P>But Fortune, who is a tender Parent, and often doth more for her favourite Offspring than either they de&s;erve or wi&s;h, had been &s;o indu&s;trious for the Captain, that whil&s;t he was laying Schemes to excute his Purpo&s;e, the Lady conceived the &s;ame De&s;ires with him&s;elf, and was on her Side contriving how to give the Captain proper En|couragement, without appearing too forward; for &s;he was a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of all Rules of Decorum. In this, however, &s;he ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded; for as the Captain was always on the Look-out, no Glance, Ge&s;ture, or Word; e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>The Satisfaction which the Captain received from the kind Behaviour of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> was not a little abated by his Apprehen&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;intere&s;ted Profe&s;&s;ions, the Captain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the Example of the re&s;t of the World, and refu&s;e his Con&s;ent to a Match, &s;o di&s;advantageous in point of Intere&s;t, to his Si&s;ter. From what Oracle he received this Opi|nion, I &s;hall leave the Reader to determine; but, however he came by it, it &s;trangely perplexed him how to regulate his Conduct &s;o, as at once to convey his Affection to the Lady, and to con|ceal it from her Brother. He, at length, re&s;olved to take all private Opportunities of making his Addre&s;&s;es; but in the Pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> to be as re&s;erved, and as much upon his Guard
<PB N="44" REF="59">
as was po&s;&s;ible; and this Conduct was highly ap|proved by the Brother.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found Means to make his Addre&s;&s;es, in expre&s;s Terms, to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, from whom he receiv'd an An&s;wer in the proper Form; <HI>viz.</HI> The An&s;wer which was fir&s;t made &s;ome thou&s;ands of Years ago, and which hath been handed down by Tradition from Mother to Daughter ever &s;ince. If I was to tran&s;late this into Latin, I &s;hould ren|der it by the&s;e two Words, <HI>Nolo Epi&s;copari;</HI> a Phra&s;e likewi&s;e of immemorial U&s;e on another Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Captain, however he came by his Know|ledge, perfectly well under&s;tood the Lady; and very &s;oon after repeated his Application with more Warmth and Earne&s;tne&s;s than before, and was a|gain, according to due Form, rejected; but as he had encrea&s;ed in the Eagerne&s;s of his De&s;ires, &s;o the Lady, with the &s;ame Propriety, decrea&s;ed in the Violence of her Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Not to tire the Reader, by leading him through every Scene of this Court&s;hip, (which, tho' in the Opinion of a certain great Author, it is the plea|&s;ante&s;t Scene of Life to the Actor, is perhaps as dull and tire&s;ome as any whatever to the Au|dience) the Captain made his Advances in Form, the Citadel was defended in Form, and at length, in proper Form, &s;urrendered at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>During this whole Time, which filled the Space of near a Month, the Captain pre&s;erved great Di&s;tance of Behaviour to his Lady, in the Pre&s;ence of the Brother, and the more he &s;ucceeded with her in private, the more re&s;erved was he in public. And as for the Lady, &s;he had no &s;ooner &s;ecured her Lover, than &s;he behaved to him before Com|pany with the highe&s;t Degree of Indifference; &s;o that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> mu&s;t have had the In&s;ight
<PB N="45" REF="60">
of the Devil (or perhaps &s;ome of his wor&s;e Qua|lities) to have entertained the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of what was going forward.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing what the Reader may perhaps expect to find in it.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN all Bargains, whether to fight, or to Marry, or concerning any other &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, little previous Ceremony is required, to bring the Matter to an I&s;&s;ue, when both Parties are really in earne&s;t. This was the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, and in le&s;s than a Month the Captain and his Lady were Man and Wife.</P>
<P>The great Concern now was to break the Mat|ter to Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> and this was undertaken by the Doctor.</P>
<P>One Day then as <HI>Allworthy</HI> was walking in his Garden, the Doctor came to him, and with great Gravity of A&s;pect, and all the Concern which he could po&s;&s;ibly affect in his Countenance, &s;aid, 'I am come, Sir, to impart an Affair to you of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence; but how &s;hall I mention to you, what almo&s;t di&s;tracts me to think of!' He then launched forth into the mo&s;t bitter Invec|tives both again&s;t Men and Women; accu&s;ing the former of having no Attachment but to their Intere&s;t, and the latter of being &s;o addicted to vicious In|clinations, that they could never be &s;afely tru&s;ted with one of the other Sex. 'Could I, &s;aid he, Sir, have &s;u&s;pected, that a Lady of &s;uch Prudence, &s;uch Judgment, &s;uch Learning, &s;hould indulge &s;o indi&s;creet a Pa&s;&s;ion; or could I have imagined that my Brother&mdash;why do I call him &s;o? He is no longer a Brother of mine.&mdash;'</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="61">
'Indeed but he is, &s;aid <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and a Bro|ther of mine too.'&mdash;Ble&s;s me, Sir, &s;aid the Doc|tor, do you know the &s;hocking Affair?&mdash;Look'ee, Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> an&s;wered the good Man, it hath been my con&s;tant Maxim in Life, to make the be&s;t of all Matters which happen. My Si&s;ter, tho' many Years younger than me, is at lea&s;t old enough to be at the Age of Di&s;cretion. Had he impo&s;ed on a Child, I &s;hould have been more aver&s;e to have forgiven him; but a Wo|man upwards of thirty mu&s;t certainly be &s;uppo&s;|ed to know what will make her mo&s;t happy. She hath married a Gentleman, tho' perhaps not quite her Equal in Fortune; and if he hath any Perfections in her Eye, which can make up that Deficiency, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why I &s;hould object to her Choice of her own Happine&s;s; which I, no more than her&s;elf, imagine to con|&s;i&s;t only in immen&s;e Wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many Declarations I have made, of com|plying with almo&s;t any Propo&s;al, have expected to have been con&s;ulted on this Occa&s;ion; but the&s;e Matters are of a very delicate Nature, and the Scruples of Mode&s;ty perhaps are not to be over|come. As to your Brother, I have really no Anger again&s;t him at all. He hath no Obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any Nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king my Con&s;ent, &s;ince the Woman is, as I have &s;aid, <HI>Sui Juris,</HI> and of a proper Age to be entirely an&s;werable only to her&s;elf for her Con|duct.'</P>
<P>The Doctor repeated his Accu&s;ations again&s;t his Brother, accu&s;ed Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> of too great Le|nity and declared that he &s;hould never more be brought either to &s;ee, or to own him for his Re|lation. He then launched forth into a Panegyric on <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Goodne&s;s, into the highe&s;t Enco|miums
<PB N="47" REF="62">
on his Friend&s;hip; and concluded, by &s;ay|ing, he &s;hould never forgive his Brother for hav|ing put the Place which he bore in that Friend&s;hip, to a hazard.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> thus an&s;wered: 'Had I conceived any Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t your Brother, I &s;hould never have carried that Re&s;entment to the Inno|cent: But, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have no &s;uch Di&s;plea|&s;ure. Your Brother appears to me to be a Man of Sen&s;e and Honour. I do not di&s;approve the Ta&s;te of my Si&s;ter; nor will I doubt but that &s;he is equally the Object of his Inclinations. I have always thought Love the only Foundation of Happine&s;s in a married State; as it can only produce that high and tender Friend&s;hip, which &s;hould always be the Cement of this Union; and, in my Opinion, all tho&s;e Marriages which are contracted from other Motives, are greatly criminal; they are a Profanation of a mo&s;t holy Ceremony, and generally end in Di&s;quiet and Mi|&s;ery: For &s;urely we may call it a Profanation, to convert this mo&s;t &s;acred In&s;titution into a wick|ed &s;acrifice to Lu&s;t, or Avarice: And what bet|ter can be &s;aid of tho&s;e Matches to which Men are induced merely by the Con&s;ideration of a' beautiful Per&s;on, or a great Fortune!</P>
<P>'To deny that Beauty is an agreeable Object to the Eye, and even worthy &s;ome Admiration, would be fal&s;e and fooli&s;h. Beautiful is an Epi|thet often u&s;ed in Scripture, and always mention|ed with Honour. It was my own Fortune to marry a Woman, whom the World thought hand&s;ome, and I can truly &s;ay, I liked her the bet|ter on that Account. But, to make this the &s;ole Con&s;ideration of Marriage, to lu&s;t after it &s;o vi|olently, as to overlook all Imperfections for its Sake, or to require it &s;o ab&s;olutely as to reject and
<PB N="48" REF="63">
di&s;dain Religion, Virtue, and Sen&s;e, which are Qualities, in their Nature, of much higher Per|fection, becau&s;e an Elegance of Per&s;on only is wanting; this is &s;urely incon&s;i&s;tent either with a wi&s;e Man, or a good Chri&s;tian. And it is, perhaps, being too charitable to conclude that &s;uch Per&s;ons mean any thing more by their Marriage, than to plea&s;e their carnal Appetites, for the Satis|faction' of which we are taught it was not ordained.</P>
<P>'In the next Place, with re&s;pect to Fortune. Worldly Prudence perhaps exacts &s;ome Con&s;i|deration on this Head; nor will I ab&s;olutely and altogether condemn it. As the World is con&s;ti|tuted, the Demands of a married State, and the Care of Po&s;terity, require &s;ome little Regard to what we call Circum&s;tances. Yet this Provi|&s;ion is greatly encrea&s;ed beyond what is really nece&s;&s;ary, by Folly and Vanity, which create abundantly more Wants than Nature. Equi|page for the Wife, and large Fortunes for the Children, are by Cu&s;tom enrolled in the Li&s;t of Nece&s;&s;aries; and, to procure the&s;e, every thing truly &s;olid and &s;weet, and virtuous, and religious,' are neglected and overlooked.</P>
<P>'And this in many Degrees; the la&s;t and great|e&s;t of which &s;eems &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable from Madne&s;s. I mean, where Per&s;ons of immen&s;e Fortunes contract them&s;elves to tho&s;e who are, and mu&s;t be, di&s;agreeable to them; to Fools and Knaves, in order to encrea&s;e an E&s;tate, already larger even than the Demands of their Plea&s;ures. Surely &s;uch Per&s;ons, if they will not be thought mad, mu&s;t own, either that they are incapable of ta&s;ting the &s;weets of the tendere&s;t Friend&s;hip, or that they &s;acrifice the greate&s;t Happine&s;s of which they are capable to the vain, uncertain, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s
<PB N="49" REF="64">
Laws of vulgar Opinion, which owe as well their Force, as their Foundation, to Folly.'</P>
<P>Here <HI>Allworthy</HI> concluded his Sermon, to which <HI>Blifil</HI> had li&s;tened with the profounde&s;t Attention, tho' it co&s;t him &s;ome pains to prevent now and then a &s;mall Di&s;compo&s;ure of his Mu&s;cles.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Which concludes the fir&s;t Book, with an In&s;tance of Ingratitude, which we hope will appear unnatural.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader, from what hath been &s;aid, may imagine that the Reconciliation (if indeed it could be &s;o called) was only Matter of Form; we &s;hall therefore pa&s;s it over, and ha&s;ten to what mu&s;t &s;urely be thought Matter of Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Doctor had acquainted his Brother with what had pa&s;t between Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and him; and added with a Smile. 'I promi&s;e you, I paid you off; nay, I ab&s;olutely de&s;ired the good Gentleman not to forgive you: For you know, after he had made a Declaration in your Favour, I might, with Safety, venture on &s;uch a Reque&s;t with a Per&s;on of his Temper; and I was wil|ling, as well for your Sake as for my own, to prevent the lea&s;t Po&s;&s;ibility of a Su&s;picion.'</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Blifil</HI> took not the lea&s;t Notice of this, at that Time; but he afterwards made a very notable U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>One of the Maxims which the Devil, in a late Vi&s;it upon Earth, left to his Di&s;ciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the Stool from under
<PB N="50" REF="65">
you. In plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when you have made your Fortune by the good Offices of a Friend, you are advi&s;ed to di&s;card him as &s;oon you can.</P>
<P>Whether the Captain acted by this Maxim, I will not po&s;itively determine; &s;o far we may confidently &s;ay, that his Actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical Principle; and indeed it is difficult to a&s;&s;ign any other Motive to them: For no &s;ooner was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> and reconciled to <HI>Allworthy,</HI> than he began to &s;hew a Coldne&s;s to his Brother, which encrea&s;ed daily; till at length it grew into Rudene&s;s, and became vi&s;ible to every one.</P>
<P>The Doctor remon&s;trated to him privately con|cerning this Behaviour, but could obtain no other Satisfaction than the following plain Declaration: 'If you di&s;like any thing in my Brother's Hou&s;e, Sir, you know you are at Liberty to quit it.' This &s;trange, cruel, and almo&s;t unaccountable In|gratitude in the Captain, ab&s;olutely broke the poor Doctor's Heart: For Ingratitude never &s;o thorough|ly pierces the human Brea&s;t, as when it proceeds from tho&s;e in who&s;e Behalf we have been guilty of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Reflections on great and good Actions, however they are received or returned by tho&s;e in who&s;e Favour they are performed, al|ways admini&s;ter &s;ome Comfort to us; but what Con&s;olation &s;hall we receive under &s;o biting a Ca|lamity as the ungratefull Behaviour of our Friend, when our wounded Con&s;cience at the &s;ame Time flies in our Face, and upbraids us with having &s;potted it in the Service of one &s;o worthle&s;s?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf &s;poke to the Captain in his Brother's Behalf, and de&s;ired to know what Offence the Doctor had committed; when the hard-hearted Villain had the Be&s;ene&s;s to &s;ay, that he never &s;hould forgive him for the Injury
<PB N="51" REF="66">
which he had endeavoured to do him in his Favour; which, he &s;aid, he had pumped out of him, and was &s;uch a cruelty, that it ought not to be forgiven.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;poke in very high Terms upon this Declaration, which, he &s;aid, became not a human Creature. He expre&s;&s;ed, indeed, &s;o much Re&s;ent|ment again&s;t an unforgiving Temper, that the Cap|tain at la&s;t pretended to be convinced by his Argu|ments, and outwardly profe&s;&s;ed to be reconciled.</P>
<P>As for the Bride, &s;he was now in her Honey|moon, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of her new Hu&s;|band, that he never appeared, to her, to be in the wrong; and his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t any Per&s;on, was a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for her Di&s;like to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Captain, at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s In&s;tance, was outwardly, as we have &s;aid, reconciled to his Bro|ther, yet the &s;ame Rancour remained in his Heart; and he found &s;o many Opportunities of giving him private Hints of this, that the Hou&s;e at la&s;t grew in&s;upportable to the poor Doctor; and he cho&s;e rather to &s;ubmit to any Inconveniencies which he might encounter in the World, than longer to bear the&s;e cruel and ungrateful In&s;ults, from a Bro|ther for whom he had done &s;o much.</P>
<P>He once intended to acquaint <HI>Allworthy</HI> with the whole; but he could not bring him&s;elf to &s;ubmit to the Confe&s;&s;ion, by which he mu&s;t take to his Share &s;o great a Portion of Guilt. Be&s;ides, by how much the wor&s;e Man he repre&s;ented his Brother to be, &s;o much the greater would his own Offence appear to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and &s;o much the greater, had he Rea&s;on to imagine, would be his Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>He feigned, therefore, &s;ome Excu&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s for his Departure, and promi&s;ed to return &s;oon again; and took leave of his Brother with &s;o well|di&s;&s;embled Content, that, as the Captain played
<PB N="52" REF="67">
his Part to the &s;ame Perfection, <HI>Allworthy</HI> remain|ed well &s;atisfied with the Truth of the Reconciliation.</P>
<P>The Doctor went directly to <HI>London,</HI> where he died &s;oon of a broken Heart; a Di&s;temper which kills more than is generally imagined, and would have a fair Title to a Place in the Bill of Mortality, did it not differ in one In&s;tance from all other Di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Phy&s;ician can cure it.</P>
<P>Now, upon the mo&s;t diligent Enquiry into the former Lives of the&s;e two Brothers, I find, be&s;ides the cur&s;ed and helli&s;h Maxim of Policy above-men|tioned, another Rea&s;on for the Captain's Conduct: The Captain, be&s;ides what we have before &s;aid of him, was a Man of great Pride and Fiercene&s;s, and had always treated his Brother, who was of a dif|ferent Complexion, and greatly deficient in both the&s;e Qualities, with the utmo&s;t Air of Superiority. The Doctor, however, had much the larger Share of Learning, and was by many reputed to have the better Under&s;tanding. This the Captain knew, and could not bear. For, tho' Envy is at be&s;t a very malignant Pa&s;&s;ion, yet is its Bitterne&s;s greatly heightened by mixing with Contempt towards the &s;ame Object; and very much afraid I am, that whenever an Obligation is joined to the&s;e two, In|dignation, and not Gratitude, will be the Product of all three.</P>

<P>THO' we have properly enough entitled this our Work, a Hi&s;tory, and not a Life; nor an Apology for a Life, as is more in Fa&s;hion; yet we intend in it rather to pur&s;ue the Method of tho&s;e Writers who profe&s;s to di&s;clo&s;e the Revolutions of Countries, than to imitate the painful and volumi|nous Hi&s;torian, who to pre&s;erve the Regularity of his Series thinks him&s;elf obliged to fill up as much Paper with the Detail of Months and Years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he employs upon tho&s;e Aeras when the greate&s;t Scenes have been tran&s;acted on the human Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="69">
Such Hi&s;tories as the&s;e do, in reality, very much re&s;emble a News-Paper, which con&s;i&s;ts of ju&s;t the &s;ame Number of Words, whether there be any News in it or not. They may likewi&s;e be com|pared to a Stage Coach, which performs con&s;tantly the &s;ame Cour&s;e, empty as well as full. The Writer, indeed, &s;eems to think him&s;elf obliged to keep even Pace with Time, who&s;e Amanuen&s;is he is; and, like his Ma&s;ter, travels as &s;lowly through Centuries of monki&s;h Dulne&s;s, when the World &s;eems to have been a&s;leep, as through that bright and bu&s;y Age &s;o nobly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the excellent <HI>Latin</HI> Poet.</P>

<P>Now it is our purpo&s;e in the en&s;uing Pages, to pur&s;ue a contrary Method. When any extraordinary Scene pre&s;ents it&s;elf (as we tru&s;t will often be the Ca&s;e) we &s;hall &s;pare no Pains nor Paper to open it at large to our Reader; but if whole Years &s;hould pa&s;s without producing any thing worthy his No|tice, we &s;hall not be afraid of a Cha&s;m in our Hi&s;|tory; but &s;hall ha&s;ten on to Matters of Con&s;equence,
<PB N="55" REF="70">
and leave &s;uch Periods of Time totally unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The&s;e are indeed to be con&s;idered as Blanks in the grand Lottery of Time. We therefore who are the Regi&s;ters of that Lottery, &s;hall imitate tho&s;e &s;agacious Per&s;ons who deal in that which is drawn at <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> and who never trouble the Public with the many Blanks they di&s;po&s;e of; but when a great Prize happens to be drawn, the News-Pa|pers are pre&s;ently filled with it, and the World is &s;ure to be informed at who&s;e Office it was &s;old: Indeed commonly two or three different Offices lay claim to the Honour of having di&s;po&s;ed of it; by which I &s;uppo&s;e the Adventurers are given to under|&s;tand that certain Brokers are in the Secrets of For|tune, and indeed of her Cabinet-Council.</P>
<P>My Reader then is not to be &s;urprized, if in the Cour&s;e of this Work, he &s;hall find &s;ome Chapters very &s;hort, and others altogether as long; &s;ome that contain only the Time of a &s;ingle Day, and others that compri&s;e Years; in a word, if my Hi&s;|tory &s;ometimes &s;eems to &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ometimes to fly. For all which I &s;hall not look on my&s;elf as accountable to any Court of Critical Juri&s;diction whatever: For as I am, in reality, the Founder of a new Province of Writing, &s;o I am at liberty to make what Laws I plea&s;e therein. And the&s;e Laws, my Readers, whom I con&s;ider as my Sub|jects, are bound to believe in and to obey; with which that they may readily and chearfully comply, I do hereby a&s;&s;ure them that I &s;hall principally re|gard their Ea&s;e and Advantage in all &s;uch In&s;tituti|ons: For I do not, like a <HI>jure divino</HI> Tyrant, ima|gine that they are my Slaves or my Commodity. I am, indeed, &s;et over them for their own Good on|ly, and was created for their U&s;e, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their Inte|re&s;t the great Rule of my Writings, they will una|nimou&s;ly

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Religious Cautions again&s;t &s;hewing too much Favour to Ba&s;tards; and a great Di&s;covery made by Mrs.</HI> Deborah Wilkins.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EIGHT Months after the Celebration of the Nuptials between Captain <HI>Blifil</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget Allworthy,</HI> a young Lady of great Beauty, Merit, and Fortune, was Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> by rea&s;on of a Fright, delivered of a fine Boy. The Child, was indeed, to all Appearance, perfect; but the Midwife di&s;covered, it was born a Month before its full Time.</P>
<P>Tho' the Birth of an Heir of his beloved Si&s;ter was a Circum&s;tance of great Joy to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> yet it did not alienate his Affections from the lit|tle Foundling, to whom he had been Godfather, had given his own Name of <HI>Thomas,</HI> and whom he had hitherto &s;eldom failed of vi&s;iting at lea&s;t once a Day, in his Nur&s;ery.</P>
<P>He told his Si&s;ter, if &s;he plea&s;ed, the new-born Infant &s;hould be bred up together with little <HI>Tom|my,</HI> to which &s;he con&s;ented, tho' with &s;ome little Reluctance: For &s;he had truly a great Complai|&s;ance for her Brother; and hence &s;he had always behaved towards the Foundling with rather more Kindne&s;s than Ladies of rigid Virtue can &s;ome|times bring them&s;elves to &s;hew to the&s;e Children, who, however, innocent, may be truly called the living Monuments of Incontinence.</P>
<P>The Captain could not &s;o ea&s;ily bring him&s;elf to bear what he condemned as a Fault in Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy.</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="72">
He gave him frequent Hints, that to adopt the Fruits of Sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted &s;everal Texts (for he was well read in Scripture) &s;uch as, <HI>He vi&s;its the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children;</HI> and, <HI>the Fathers have eaten &s;our Grapes, and the Children's Teeth are &s;et on edge, &amp;c.</HI> Whence he argued the Legality of pu|ni&s;hing the Crime of the Parent on the Ba&s;tard. He &s;aid, 'Tho' the Law did not po&s;itively allow the de&s;troying &s;uch ba&s;e-born Children, yet it held them to be the Children of no body; that the Church con&s;idered them as the Children of no bo|dy; and that at the be&s;t, they ought to be brought up to the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t Offices of the Common|wealth.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> an&s;wered to all this and much more which the Captain had urged on this Subject, 'That however guilty the Parents might be, the Children were certainly innocent. That as to the Texts he had quoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation again&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> for the Sin of Idolatry, of relinqui&s;hing and hating their heavenly King; and the latter was parabo|lically &s;poken, and rather intended to denote the certain and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of Sin, than any expre&s;s Judgment again&s;t it. But to repre|&s;ent the Almighty as avenging the Sins of the Guilty on the Innocent, was indecent, if not bla&s;|phemous, as it was to repre&s;ent him acting again&s;t the fir&s;t Principles of natural Ju&s;tice, and again&s;t the original Notions of Right and Wrong, which he him&s;elf had implanted in our Minds; by which we were to judge not only in all Matters which were not revealed, but even of the Truth of Revelation it&s;elf. He &s;aid, he knew many held the &s;ame Principles with the Captain on this Head; but he was him&s;elf firmly convinced to the
<PB N="58" REF="73">
contrary, and would provide in the &s;ame Manner for this poor Infant, as if a legitimate Child had had the Fortune to have been found in the &s;ame Place.'</P>
<P>While the Captain was taking all Opportunities to pre&s;s the&s;e and &s;uch like Arguments to remove the little Foundling from Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s, of who&s;e Fondne&s;s for him he began to be jealous, Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> had made a Di&s;covery, which in its E+vent threatened at lea&s;t to prove more fatal to poor <HI>Tommy,</HI> than all the Rea&s;onings of the Captain.</P>
<P>Whether the in&s;atiable Curio&s;ity of this good Woman had carried her on to that Bu&s;ine&s;s, or, whether &s;he did it to confirm her&s;elf in the good Graces of Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding he outward Behaviour to the Foundling, frequently abu&s;ed the Infant in private, and her Brother too for his Fondne&s;s to it, I will not determine; but &s;he had now, as &s;he conceived, fully detected the Father of the Foundling.</P>
<P>Now as this was a Di&s;covery of great Con&s;e+quence, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to trace it from the Fountain-head. We &s;hall therefore very minutel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> lay open tho&s;e previous Matters by which it was produced; and for that Purpo&s;e, we &s;hall be obli+ged to reveal all the Secrets of a little Family, with which my Reader is at pre&s;ent entirely unacquainted and of which the Oeconomy was &s;o rare and ex+traordinary, that I fear it will &s;hock the utmo&s;t Credulity of many married Per&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The De&s;cription of a dome&s;tic Government founder upon Rules directly contrary to tho&s;e of</HI> Ari&s;totle</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY Reader may plea&s;e to remember he hath been informed that <HI>Jenny Jones</HI> had live &s;ome Years with a certain Schoolma&s;ter, who
<PB N="59" REF="74">
had, at her earne&s;t De&s;ire, in&s;tructed her in <HI>Latin,</HI> in which, to do ju&s;tice to her Genius, &s;he had &s;o improved her&s;elf, that &s;he was become a better Scholar than her Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Indeed, tho' this poor Man had undertaken a Profe&s;&s;ion to which Learning mu&s;t be allowed ne|ce&s;&s;ary, this was the lea&s;t of his Commendations. He was one of the be&s;t-natured Fellows in the World, and was at the &s;ame time Ma&s;ter of &s;o much Plea&s;antry and Humour that he was reputed the Wit of the Country; and all the neighbouring Gentlemen were &s;o de&s;irous of his Company, that as denying was not his Talent, he &s;pent much Time at their Hou&s;es, which he might with more Emolument have &s;pent in his School.</P>
<P>It may be imagined, that a Gentleman &s;o qua|lified, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, was in no danger of be|coming formidable to the learned Seminaries of <HI>Eton</HI> or <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> To &s;peak plainly, his Scho|lars were divided into two Cla&s;&s;es. In the up|per of which was a young Gentleman, the Son of a neighbouring 'Squire, who at the Age of Se|venteen was ju&s;t entered into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a &s;econd Son of the &s;ame Gentle|man, who, together with &s;everal Pari&s;h-boys, was learning to read and write.</P>
<P>The Stipend ari&s;ing hence would hardly have indulged the Schoolma&s;ter in the Luxuries of Life, had he not added to this Office tho&s;e of Clerk and Barber, and had not Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> added to the whole an Annuity of Ten Pound, which the poor Man received every Chri&s;tmas, and with which he was enabled to chear his Heart during that &s;acred Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>Among his other Trea&s;ures, the Pedagogue had a Wife whom he had married out of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Kitchen, for her Fortune, <HI>viz.</HI> Twenty Pound, which &s;he had there ama&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="75">
This Woman was not very amiable in her Per|&s;on. Whether &s;he &s;at to my Friend <HI>Hogarth,</HI> or no, I will not determine; but &s;he exactly re&s;embled the young Woman who is pouring out her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Tea in the third Picture of the Harlot's Progre&s;s. She was be&s;ides a profe&s;t Follower of that notable Sect founded by <HI>Xantippe</HI> of old; by means of which, &s;he became more formidable in the School than her Hu&s;band; for to confe&s;s the Truth, he was never Ma&s;ter there, or any where el&s;e, in her Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Tho' her Countenance did not denote much na|tural Sweetne&s;s of Temper, yet this was perhaps &s;omewhat &s;oured by a Circum&s;tance which gene|rally poi&s;ons matrimonial Felicity. For Children are rightly called the Pledges of Love; and her Hu&s;band, tho' they had been married nine Years, had given her no &s;uch Pledges; a Default for which he had no Excu&s;e, either from Age or Health, being not yet thirty Years old, and, what they call a jolly, bri&s;k, young Man.</P>
<P>Hence aro&s;e another Evil which produced no little Unea&s;ine&s;s to the poor Pedagogue, of whom &s;he maintained &s;o con&s;tant a Jealou&s;y, that he dur&s;t hardly &s;peak to one Woman in the Pari&s;h; for the lea&s;t Degree of Civility, or even Corre&s;pondence with any Female, was &s;ure to bring his Wife upon her Back, and his own.</P>
<P>In order to guard her&s;elf again&s;t matrimonial Injuries in her own Hou&s;e, as &s;he kept one Maid Servant, &s;he always took Care to chu&s;e her out of that Order of Females, who&s;e Faces are taken as a Kind of Security for their Virtue; of which Number <HI>Jenny Jones,</HI> as the Reader hath been be|fore informed, was one.</P>
<P>As the Face of this young Woman might be called pretty good Security of the before-mentioned
<PB N="61" REF="76">
Kind, and as her Behaviour had been always ex|tremely mode&s;t; which is the certain Con&s;equence of Under&s;tanding in Woman; &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed above four Years at Mr. <HI>Partridge'</HI>s, (for that was the Schoolma&s;ter's Name) without creating the lea&s;t Su&s;picion in her Mi&s;tre&s;s. Nay, &s;he had been treat|ed with uncommon Kindne&s;s, and her Mi&s;tre&s;s had permitted Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> to give her tho&s;e In&s;truc|tions, which have been before commemorated.</P>
<P>But it is with Jealou&s;y, as with the Gout. When &s;uch Di&s;tempers are in the Blood, there is never any Security again&s;t their breaking out; and that often on the &s;lighte&s;t Occa&s;ions, and when lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Thus it happened to Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> who had &s;ubmitted four Years to her Hu&s;band's teaching this young Woman, and had &s;uffered her often to neglect her Work, in order to pur&s;ue her Learning. For pa&s;&s;ing by one Day, as the Girl, was reading, and her Ma&s;ter leaning over her, the Girl, I know not for what Rea&s;on, &s;uddenly &s;tarted up from her Chair; and this was the fir&s;t Time that Su&s;picion ever entered into the Head of her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This did not, however, at that Time, di&s;cover it&s;elf, but lay lurking in her Mind, like a concealed Enemy, who waits for a Reinforcement of addi|tional Strength, before he openly declares him&s;elf, and proceeds upon ho&s;tile Operations; and &s;uch additional Stength &s;oon arrived to corroborate her Su&s;picion: For not long after, the Hu&s;band and Wife being at Dinner, the Ma&s;ter &s;aid to his Maid, <HI>Da mihi aliquid Potum;</HI> upon which the poor Girl &s;miled, perhaps at the Badne&s;s of the Latin, and when her Mi&s;tre&s;s ca&s;t her Eyes on her, blu&s;hed, po&s;&s;ibly with a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having laughed at her Ma&s;ter. Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> upon this, immedi|ately fell into a Fury, and di&s;charged the Trencher on which &s;he was eating, at the Head of poor <HI>Jenny,</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="77">
crying out, 'You impudent Whore, do you play Tricks with my Hu&s;band before my Face?' and, at the &s;ame In&s;tant, ro&s;e from her Chair, with a Knife in her Hand, with which, mo&s;t probably, &s;he would have executed very tragical Vengeance, had not the Girl taken the Advantage of being nearer the Door than her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and avoided her Fury, by running away; for, as to the poor Hu&s;band whether Surprize had rendered him motionle&s;s, or Fear (which is full as probable) had re&s;trained him from venturing at any Oppo&s;ition, he &s;at &s;taring and trembling in his Chair; nor did he once offer to move or &s;peak, till his Wife returning from the Pur&s;uit of <HI>Jenny,</HI> made &s;ome defen&s;ive Mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for his own Pre&s;ervation; and he likewi&s;e was obliged to retreat, after the Example of the Maid.</P>
<P>This good Woman was, no more than <HI>Othello,</HI> of a Di&s;po&s;ition,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;To make a Life of Jealou&s;y,</L>
<L>And follow &s;till the Changes of the Moon</L>

<P>with her, as well as him;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;To be once in doubt</L>

<P>&s;he therefore ordered <HI>Jenny</HI> immediately to pack up her Alls, and be gone; for that &s;he was deter|mined &s;he &s;hould not &s;leep that Night within her Walls.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> had profited too much, by Expe|rience, to interpo&s;e in a Matter of this Nature. He therefore had Recour&s;e to his u&s;ual Recipe of Pa|tience; for, tho' he was not a great Adept in Latin, he remembered and well under&s;tood the Advice contained in the&s;e Words:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Leve fit, quod bene fertur Onus.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="63" REF="78">
In Engli&s;h: 'A Burden becomes lighte&s;t, when it is well borne.'</P>
<P>Which he had always in his Mouth, and of which, to &s;ay the Truth, he had often Occa&s;ion to experi|ence the Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> offered to make Prote&s;tations of her In|nocence; but the Tempe&s;t was too high for her to be heard. She betook her&s;elf to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Packing, for which a &s;mall Quantity of brown Pa|per &s;ufficed; and, having received her &s;mall Pittance of Wages, &s;he returned home.</P>
<P>The Schoolma&s;ter and his Con&s;ort pa&s;s'd their Time unplea&s;antly enough that Evening; but &s;ome|thing or other happened before the next Morning, which a little abated the Fury of Mrs. <HI>Partridge;</HI> and &s;he at length admitted her Hu&s;band to make his Excu&s;e. To which &s;he gave the readier Belief, as he had, in&s;tead of de&s;iring her to recall <HI>Jenny,</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;ed a Satisfaction in her being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;aying, She was grown of little U&s;e as a Servant, &s;pending all her time in reading, and was become, moreover, very pert and ob&s;tinate: For indeed &s;he and her Ma|&s;ter had lately had frequent Di&s;putes in Literature; in which, as hath been &s;aid, &s;he was become greatly his Superior. This, however, he would by no means allow; and, as he called her per&s;i&s;ting in the Right, Ob&s;tinacy, he began to hate her with no &s;mall Invetracy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing one of the mo&s;t bloody Battles, or rather Duels, that were ever recorded in Dome&s;tic Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR the Rea&s;ons mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and &s;ome other matrimonial Con|ce&s;&s;ions, well known to mo&s;t Hu&s;bands; and which,
<PB N="64" REF="79">
like the Secrets of Free Ma&s;onry, &s;hould be di|vulged to none who are not Members of that ho|nourable Fraternity, Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> was pretty well &s;atisfied, that &s;he had condemned her Hu&s;|band without Cau&s;e, and endeavoured, by Acts of Kindne&s;s, to make him Amends for her fal&s;e Su&s;pi|cion. Her Pa&s;&s;ions were indeed, equally violent, which every Way they inclined: for, as &s;he could be extremely angry, &s;o could &s;he be altogether as fond.</P>
<P>But tho' the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions ordinarily &s;ucceeded each other, and &s;carce twenty-four Hours ever pa&s;&s;ed in which the Pedagogue was not, in &s;ome Degree, the Object of both; yet, on extraordinary Occa|&s;ions, when the Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger had raged very high, the Remi&s;&s;ion was u&s;ually longer, and &s;o was the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; for &s;he continued longer in a State of Affability, after this Fit of Jealou&s;y was ended, than her Hu&s;band had ever known before: And had it not been for &s;ome little Exerci&s;es, which all the Followers of <HI>Xantip|pe</HI> are obliged to perform daily, Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> would have enjoyed a perfect Serenity of &s;everal Months.</P>
<P>Perfect Calms at Sea are always &s;u&s;pected by the experienced Mariner to be the Forerunners of a Storm: And I know &s;ome Per&s;ons, who, with|out being generally the Devotees of Super&s;tition, are apt to apprehend, that great and unu&s;ual Peace or Tranquillity, will be attended with its oppo|&s;ite: For which Rea&s;on the Antients u&s;ed, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, to &s;acrifice to the Godde&s;s <HI>Neme&s;is;</HI> a Deity who was thought by them to look with an invidious Eye on human Felicity, and to have a peculiar Delight in overturning it.</P>
<P>As we are very far from believing in any&s;uch Hea|then Godde&s;s, or from encouraging any Super&s;ti|tion, &s;o we wi&s;h Mr. <HI>John Fr&mdash;,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;uch Philo&s;opher, would be&s;tir him&s;elf a little, in order
<PB N="65" REF="80">
to find out the real Cau&s;e of this &s;udden Tran&s;ition, from good to bad Fortune, which hath been &s;o often remarked, and of which we &s;hall proceed to give an In&s;tance; for it is our Province to relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">acts, and we &s;hall leave Cau&s;es to Per&s;ons of much higher Genius.</P>
<P>Mankind have always taken great Delight in know|ing and de&s;canting on the Actions of others. Hence there have been, in all Ages, and Nations, certain, Places &s;et apart for public Rendezvous, where the cu|rious might meet, and &s;atisfy their mutual Curio&s;i|ty. Among the&s;e, the Barbers Shops have ju&s;tly bore the Pre-eminence. Among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> Bar|bers News was a proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion, and <HI>Horace,</HI> in one of his Epi&s;tles, makes honourable Mention of the <HI>Roman</HI> Barbers in the &s;ame Light.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>England</HI> are known to be no wi&s;e in|ferior to their <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Predece&s;&s;ors. You there &s;ee foreign Affairs di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a Manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the Coffee-hou&s;es; and dome&s;tick Occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former, than in the latter. But this &s;erves only for the Men. Now, whereas the Females of this Country, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the lower Order, do a&s;&s;ociate them|&s;elves much more than tho&s;e of other Nations, our Polity would be highly deficient, if they had not &s;ome Place &s;et apart likewi&s;e for the Indulgence of their Curio&s;ity, &s;eeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half of the Species.</P>
<P>In enjoying, therefore, &s;uch Place of Rendez|vous, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fair ought to e&s;teem them&s;elves more happy than any of their foreign Si&s;ters; as I do not remember either to have read in Hi&s;tory, to have &s;een in my Travels, any thing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e Kind.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> who&s;e Jealou&s;y, as the Reader well knows, was long &s;ince cured, and who had no other Quarrel to her Maid, an&s;wered boldly, She did not know any Obligation the Pari&s;h had to her on that Account, for &s;he believed <HI>Jenny</HI> had &s;carce left her Equal behind her.</P>
<P>'No truly, &s;aid the Go&s;&s;ip, I hope not, tho'I fancy we have Sluts enow too.' 'Then you have not heard, it &s;eems, that &s;he hath been brought to bed of two Ba&s;tards; but as they are not born here, my Hu&s;band, and the other Over&s;eer, &s;ays we &s;hall not be obliged to keep them.'</P>
<P>'Two Ba&s;tards!' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> ha&s;tily, 'you &s;urprize me. I don't know whe|ther we mu&s;t keep them; but I am &s;ure they mu&s;t have been begotten here, for the Wench hath not been nine Months gone away.'</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;o quick and &s;udden as the Ope|rations of the Mind, e&s;pecially when Hope, or Fear; or Jealou&s;y to which the two others are but Journeymen, &s;et it to work. It occurred in|&s;tantly to her, that <HI>Jenny</HI> had &s;carce ever been out of her own Hou&s;e, while &s;he lived with her. The leaning over the Chair, the &s;udden &s;tarting up, the Latin, the Smile, and many other Things ru&s;hed upon her all at once. The Satisfaction her Hu&s;|band
<PB N="67" REF="82">
expre&s;&s;ed in the Departure of <HI>Jenny,</HI> appear|ed now to be only di&s;&s;embled; again, in the &s;ame In&s;tant to be real, and yet to confirm her Jealou&s;y, as proceeding from Satiety, and a hundred other bad Cau&s;es. In a Word, &s;he was convinced of her Hu&s;band's Guilt, and immediately left the A&s;|&s;embly in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As fair <HI>Grimalkin,</HI> who, though the younge&s;t of the Feline Family, degenerates not in Fero&s;ity from the elder Branches of her Hou&s;e, and, though, in|ferior in Strength, is equal in Fiercene&s;s to the no|ble Tyger him&s;elf, when a little Mou&s;e, whom it hath long tormented in Sport, e&s;capes from her Clutches for a while, frets, &s;colds, growls, &s;wears; but if the Trunk, or Box, behind which the Mou&s;e lay hid, be again removed, &s;he flies like Lightning on her Prey, and with envenomed wrath, bites, &s;cratches, mumbles and tears the little Animal.</P>
<P>Not with le&s;s Fury did Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> fly on the poor Pedagogue. Her Tongue, Teeth, and Hands, fell all upon him at once. His Wig was in an In&s;tant torn from his Head, his Shirt from his Back, and from his Face de&s;cended five Streams of Blood, denoting the Number of Claws with which Nature had unhappily armed the Enemy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> acted for &s;ome Time on the de|fen&s;ive only; indeed he attempted only to guard his Face with his Hands; but as he found that his Antagoni&s;t abated nothing of her Rage, he thought &s;he might, at lea&s;t, endeavour to di&s;arm her, or ra|ther to confine her Arms; in doing which, her Cap fell off in the Struggle, and her Hair being too &s;hort to reach her Shoulders, erected it&s;elf on her Head; her Stays likewi&s;e, which were laced through one &s;ingle Hole at the Bottom, bur&s;t open, and her Brea&s;ts, which were much more redundant than her Hair, hung down below her middle; her
<PB N="68" REF="83">
Face was likewi&s;e marked with the Blood of her Hu&s;band; her Teeth gna&s;hed with Rage; and Fire, &s;uch as &s;parkles from a Smith's Forge, darted from her Eyes. So that, altogether, this Amazo|nian Heroine might have been an Object of Ter|ror to a much bolder Man than Mr. <HI>Partridge.</HI></P>
<P>He had at length, the good Fortune, by getting Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Arms, to render tho&s;e Weapons, which &s;he wore at the Ends of her Fingers, u&s;ele&s;s; which &s;he no &s;ooner perceived, than the Softne&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her Sex prevailed over her Rage, and &s;he pre&s;ently di&s;&s;olved in Tears, which &s;oon after concluded i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Fit.</P>
<P>That &s;mall Share of Sen&s;e which Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> had hitherto pre&s;erved through this Scene of Fury of the Cau&s;e of which he was hitherto ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran in&s;tantly into the Street, hollowing out, that his Wife was in the Agonies of Death, and be&s;eeching the Neighbours to fly with the utmo&s;t Ha&s;te to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Se|veral good Women obeyed his Summons, who entering his Hou&s;e, and applying the u&s;ual Reme|dies on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> was, all length, to the great Joy of her Hu&s;band, brought to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had a little recollected her Spirits and &s;omewhat compo&s;ed her&s;elf with a Cordial, &s;he began to inform the Company of the manifold Injuries &s;he had received from her Hu&s;band; who, &s;he &s;aid, was not content to injure her in her Bed; but, upon her upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruele&s;t Manner imaginable; had tore her Cap and Hair from her Head, and her Stays from her Body, giving her, at the &s;ame Time, &s;e|veral Blows, the Marks of which &s;he &s;hould carry to the Grave.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="84">
The poor Man, who bore on his Face many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ore vi&s;ible Marks of the Indignaion of his Wife, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">od in &s;ilent A&s;toni&s;hment at this Accu&s;ation; which the Reader will, I believe, bear Witne&s;s for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">m, had greatly exceeded the Truth; for indeed he had not &s;truck her once; and this Silence being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">terpreted to be a Confe&s;&s;ion of the Charge, by the whole Court, they all began at once, <HI>una voce,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ebuke and revile him, repeating often, that none at a Coward ever &s;truck a Woman.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> bore all this patiently; but when is Wife appealed to the Blood on her Face, as an Evidence of his Barbarity, he could not help laying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">laim to his own Blood, for &s;o it really was: as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e thought it very unnatural, that this &s;hould ri&s;e up (as we are taught that of a murdered Per&s;on of|ten doth) in Vengeance again&s;t him.</P>
<P>To this the Women made no other An&s;wer, man that it was Pity it had not come from his Heart, in&s;tead of his Face; all declaring, that if their Hu&s;|bands &s;hould lift their Hands again&s;t them, they would have their Heart's Blood out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>After much Admonition for what was pa&s;t, and much good Advice to Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> for his future Behaviour, the Company, at length, departed, and oft the Hu&s;band and Wife to a per&s;onal Conference together, in which Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> &s;oon learned the Cau&s;e of all his Sufferings.</P>

<P><HI>Containing much Matter to exerci&s;e the Judgment and Reflection of the Reader.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Believe it is a true Ob&s;ervation, that few Secrets are divulged to one Per&s;on only; but certainly, would be next to a Miracle, that a Fact of this
<PB N="70" REF="85">
Kind &s;hould be known to a whole Pari&s;h, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;pire any farther.</P>
<P>And, indeed, a very few Days had pa&s;t, before the Country, to u&s;e a common Phra&s;e, rung of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Schoolma&s;ter of <HI>Little Baddington;</HI> who was &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have beaten his Wife in the mo&s;t cruel Manner. Nay, in &s;ome Places, it was reported he had mur+dered her; in others, that he had broke her Arms in others, her Legs; in &s;hort, there was &s;carce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Injury which can be done to a human Creature, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> what Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> was &s;omewhere or other affirmed to have received from her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of this Quarrel was likewi&s;e variou&s;ly reported; for, as &s;ome People &s;aid that Mrs. <HI>Par+tridge</HI> had caught her Hu&s;band in Bed with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Maid, &s;o many other Rea&s;ons, of a very different Kind, went aboard. Nay, &s;ome transferred th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Guilt to the Wife, and the Jealou&s;y to the Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> had long ago heard of this Quar|rel; but, as a different Cau&s;e from the true one had reached her Ears, &s;he thought proper to conceal it and the rather, perhaps, as the Blame was univer|&s;ally laid on Mr. <HI>Partridge;</HI> and his Wife, when &s;he was Servant to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> had in &s;omething offended Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who was not of a very forgiving Temper.</P>
<P>But Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who&s;e Eyes could &s;ee Ob+jects at a Di&s;tance, and who could very well loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> forwards a few Years into Futurity, had perceive a &s;trong Likelihood of Captain <HI>Blifil'</HI>s being here after her Ma&s;ter; and, as &s;he plainly di&s;cerned, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Captain bore no great Good will to the little Foundling, &s;he fancied it would be rendering him an agreeable Service, if &s;he could make any Di&s;+coveries that might le&s;&s;en the Affection which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;eemed to have contracted for this Child and which gave vi&s;ible Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Captain
<PB N="71" REF="86">
who could not entirely conceal it even before <HI>All|worthy</HI> him&s;elf; though his Wife, who acted her Part much better in public, frequently recom|mended to him her own Example, of conniving at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Folly of her Brother, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t as well perceived, and as much re&s;ented as any other po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> having therefore, by Accident, got|ten a true Scent of the above Story, though long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fter it had happened, failed not to &s;atisfy her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">horoughly of all the Particulars, and then acquaint|ed the Captain, that &s;he had at la&s;t di&s;covered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rue Father of the little Ba&s;tard, which &s;he was &s;or|ry, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ee her Ma&s;ter lo&s;e his Reputation in the Country, by taking &s;o much Notice of.</P>
<P>The Captain chid her for the Conclu&s;ion of her Speech, as an improper A&s;&s;urance in judging of her Ma&s;ter's Actions: For if his Honour, or his Under|&s;tanding, would have &s;uffered the Captain to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n Alliance with Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> his Pride would by no means have admitted it. And, to &s;ay the Truth, there is no Conduct le&s;s politic, than to enter into any Confederacy with your Friend's Ser|vants, again&s;t their Ma&s;ter. For, by the&s;e Means you afterwards become the Slave of the&s;e very Ser|vants; by whom you are con&s;tantly liable to be betrayed. And this Con&s;ideration, perhaps, it was which prevented Captain <HI>Blifil</HI> from being more explicite with Mrs. <HI>Wilkins;</HI> or from encouraging &s;he Abu&s;e which &s;he had be&s;towed on <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P>But though he declared no Satisfaction to Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> at this Di&s;covery, he enjoyed not a little from it in his own Mind, and re&s;olved to make the be&s;t U&s;e of it he was able.</P>
<P>He kept this Matter a long Time concealed with|in his own Brea&s;t, in Hopes that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> might hear it from &s;ome other Per&s;on; but Mrs.
<PB N="72" REF="87">
<HI>Wilkins,</HI> whether &s;he re&s;ented the Captain's Beha|viour, or whether his Cunning was beyond her, and &s;he feared the Di&s;covery might di&s;plea&s;e him, never afterwards opened her Lips about the Matter.</P>
<P>I have thought it &s;omewhat &s;trange, upon Reflec|tion, that the Hou&s;e-keeper never acquainted Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> with this News, as Women are more inclin|ed to communicate all Pieces of Intelligence to their own Sex, than to ours. The only Way, as it appears to me, of &s;olving this Difficulty, is, by imputing it to that Di&s;tance which was now grown between the Lady and the Hou&s;e-keeper: Whether this aro&s;e from a Jealou&s;y in Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> that <HI>Wil+kins</HI> &s;hewed too great a Re&s;pect to the Foundling for while &s;he was endeavouring to ruin the little In|fant, in order to ingratiate her&s;elf with the Captain &s;he was every Day more and more commending i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> before <HI>Allworthy,</HI> as his Fondne&s;s for it every Day encrea&s;ed. This, notwith&s;tanding all the Care &s;he took at other Times to expre&s;s the direct contrary to Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> perhaps offended that delicate Lady who certainly now hated Mrs. <HI>Wilkins;</HI> and though &s;he did not, or po&s;&s;ibly could not, ab&s;olutely re|move her, from her Place, &s;he found, however the Means of making her Life very unea&s;y. This Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> at length, &s;o re&s;ented, that &s;he very openly &s;hewed all Manner of Re&s;pect and Fondne&s;s to little <HI>Tommy,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to Mrs. <HI>Blifil.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain, therefore, finding the Story i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Danger of peri&s;hing, he at la&s;t took an Opportunity to reveal it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was one Day engaged with Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e on Charity; In which the Captain with great Learning, proved to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> that the Word <HI>Charity,</HI> in Scripture, no where means Beneficence, or Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>'The Chri&s;tian Religion, he &s;aid, was in&s;titu|ted
<PB N="73" REF="88">
for much nobler Purpo&s;es, than to enforce a Le&s;&s;on which many Heathen Philo&s;ophers had taught us long before, and which, though it might, perhaps, be called a moral Virtue, favour|ed but little of that &s;ublime Chri&s;tian-like Di&s;po|&s;ition, that va&s;t Elevation of Thought, in Puri|ty approaching to angelic Perfection, to be attain|ed, expre&s;&s;ed, and felt only by Grace. Tho&s;e (he &s;aid) came nearer to the Scripture Meaning, who under&s;tood by it Candour, or the forming of a benevolent Opinion of our Brethren, and pa&s;&s;ing a favourable Judgment on their Actions; a Virtue much higher, and more exten&s;ive in its Nature, than a pitiful Di&s;tribution of Alms, which though we would never &s;o much prejudice, or even ruin our Families, could never reach many; whereas Cha|rity, in the other and truer Sen&s;e, might be ex|tended to all Mankind.'</P>
<P>He &s;aid, 'Con&s;idering who the Di&s;ciples were, it would be ab&s;urd to conceive the Doctrine of Gene|ro&s;ity, or giving Alms, to have been preached to them. And, as we could not well imagine this Doctrine &s;hould be preached by its divine Author to Men who could not practi&s;e it, much le&s;s &s;hall we think it under&s;tood &s;o by tho&s;e who can practi&s;e it, and do not.</P>
<P>'But though, continued he, there is, I am afraid, little Merit in the&s;e Benefactions; there would, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, be much Plea&s;ure in them to a good Mind, if it was not abated by one Con&s;ideration. I mean, that we are liable to be impo&s;ed upon, and to confer our choice&s;t Favours often on the Unde&s;er|ving, as you mu&s;t own was your Ca&s;e in your Boun|ty to that worthle&s;s Fellow <HI>Partridge:</HI> For two or three &s;uch Examples mu&s;t greatly le&s;&s;en the inward Satisfaction, which a good Man would otherwi&s;e find in Genero&s;ity; nay, may even make him timo|rous in be&s;towing, le&s;t he &s;hould be guilty of &s;up|porting
<PB N="74" REF="89">
Vice, and encouraging the Wicked; a Crime of a very black Dye, and for which it will by no means be a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e, that we have not actually intended &s;uch an Encouragement; unle&s;s we have u&s;ed the utmo&s;t Caution in chu&s;ing the Ob|jects of our Beneficence. A Con&s;ideration which, I make no Doubt, hath greatly checked the Libera|lity of many a worthy and pious Man.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> an&s;wered, 'He could not di&s;pute with the Captain in the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, and there|fore could &s;ay nothing as to the true Sen&s;e of the Word, which is tran&s;lated <HI>Charity;</HI> but that he had always thought it was interpreted to con&s;i&s;t in Ac|tion, and that giving Alms con&s;tituted at lea&s;t one Branch of that Virtue.</P>
<P>'As to the meritorious Part, he &s;aid, he readily a|greed with the Captain; for where could be the Merit of barely di&s;charging a Duty; which he &s;aid, let the Word Charity have what Con&s;truction it would, it &s;ufficiently appeared to be from the whole Tenor of the New Te&s;tament. And as he thought it an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, enjoined both by the Chri&s;tian Law, and by the Law of Nature it&s;elf; &s;o was it withal &s;o plea&s;ant, that if any Duty could be &s;aid to be its own Reward, or to pay us while we were di&s;charging it, it was this.</P>
<P>'To confe&s;s the Truth, &s;aid he, there is one De|gree of Genero&s;ity, (of Charity I would have called it) which &s;eems to have &s;ome Shew of Merit, and that is, where from a Principle of Benevolence, and Chri&s;tian Love, we be&s;tow on another what we really want our&s;elves; where, in order to le&s;&s;en the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of another, we conde&s;cend to &s;hare &s;ome Part of them, by giving what even our own Nece&s;&s;ities cannot well &s;pare. This is I think, meritorious; but to relieve our Brethren only with our Superfluities; to be charitable (I mu&s;t u&s;e the Word) rather at the Expence of our Coffers than
<PB N="75" REF="90">
our&s;elves; to &s;ave &s;everal Families from Mi&s;ery ra|ther than hang an extraordinary Picture in our Hou&s;es, or gratify any other idle, ridiculous Vanity, this &s;eems to be only being Chri&s;tians, nay indeed, only being human Creatures. Nay, I will venture to go farther, it is being in &s;ome degree Epicures: For what could the greate&s;t Epicure wi&s;h rather than to eat with many Mouths in&s;tead of one; which I think may be predicated of any one who knows that the Bread of many is owing to his own Large&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>'As to the Apprehen&s;ion of be&s;towing Bounty on &s;uch as may hereafter prove unworthy Objects, be|cau&s;e many have proved &s;uch; &s;urely it can never deter a good Man from Genero&s;ity: I do not think a few or many Examples of Ingratitude can ju&s;tify a Man's hardening his Heart again&s;t the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his Fellow Creatures; nor do I believe it can ever have &s;uch Effect on a truely benevolent Mind. No|thing le&s;s than a Per&s;ua&s;ion of univer&s;al Depravity can lock up the Charity of a good Man; and this Per&s;ua&s;ion mu&s;t lead him, I think, either into Athei&s;m, or Enthu&s;ia&s;m; but &s;urely it is unfair to argue &s;uch univer&s;al Depravity from a few vicious Individuals; nor was this, I believe, ever done by a Man, who upon &s;earching his own Mind found one certain Exception to the general Rule. He then concluded by a&s;king who that <HI>Partridge</HI> was whom he had called a worthle&s;s Fellow.'</P>
<P>'I mean, &s;aid the Captain, <HI>Partridge,</HI> the Bar|ber, the Schoolma&s;ter, what do you call him? <HI>Partridge,</HI> the Father of the little Child which you found in your Bed.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> expre&s;t great Surprize at this Account, and the Captain as great at his Ignorance of it: For he &s;aid, he had known it above a Month, and at length recollected with much Difficulty that he was told it by Mrs. <HI>Wilkins.</HI></P>

who having confirmed what the Captain had &s;aid, was by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> by and with the Captain's Advice, di&s;patched to <HI>Little Baddington</HI> to inform her&s;elf of the Truth of the Fact: For the Captain expre&s;t great Di&s;like to all ha&s;ty Proceedings in criminal Matters, and &s;aid he would by no means have Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> take any Re&s;olution either to the Prejudice of the Child or its Father, before he was &s;atisfied that the latter was guilty: For tho' he had privately &s;atisfied him&s;elf of this from one of <HI>Partridge'</HI>s Neighbours, yet he was too generous to give any &s;uch Evidence to Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT may be wondered that a Story &s;o well known, and which had furni&s;hed &s;o much matter of Con|ver&s;ation, &s;hould never have been mentioned to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf, who was perhaps the only Per&s;on in that Country who had never heard of it.</P>
<P>To account in &s;ome mea&s;ure for this to the Rea|der, I think proper to inform him that there was no one in the Kingdom le&s;s intere&s;ted in oppo&s;ing that Doctrine concerning the meaning of the Word Cha|rity, which hath been &s;een in the preceding Chapter, than our good Man. Indeed, he was equally intitled to this Virtue in either Sen&s;e: For as no Man was ever more &s;en&s;ible of the Wants, or more ready to relieve the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, &s;o none could be more tender of their Characters, or &s;lower to believe any thing to their Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Scandal, therefore, never found any Acce&s;s to his Table: For it hath been long &s;ince ob&s;erved that you
<PB N="77" REF="92">
may know a Man by his Companions; &s;o I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that by attending to the Conver&s;ation at a great Man's Table, you may &s;atisfy your&s;elf of his Religion, his Politics, his Ta&s;te, and indeed of his entire Di&s;po&s;ition: For tho' a few odd Fellows will utter their own Sentiments in all Places, yet much the greater Part of Mankind have enough of the Cour|tier to accommodate their Conver&s;ation to the Ta&s;te and Inclination of their Superiors.</P>
<P>But to return to Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who having exe|cuted her Commi&s;&s;ion with great Di&s;patch, tho' at fifteen Miles Di&s;tance, brought back, &s;uch a Con|firmation of the Schoolma&s;ter's Guilt, that Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> determined to &s;end for the Criminal, and ex|amine him <HI>viva voce.</HI> Mr. <HI>Partridge,</HI> therefore, was &s;ummoned to attend, in order to his Defence (if he could make any) again&s;t this Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>At the Time appointed, before Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf, at <HI>Paradi&s;e-Hall,</HI> came as well the &s;aid <HI>Par|tridge,</HI> with <HI>Anne</HI> his Wife, as Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> his Accu&s;er.</P>
<P>And now Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> being &s;eated in the Chair of Ju&s;tice, Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> was brought before him. Having heard his Accu&s;ation from the Mouth of Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> he pleaded not guilty, making many vehe|ment Prote&s;tations of his Innocence.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> was then examined, who, after a mode&s;t Apology for being obliged to &s;peak the Truth again&s;t her Hu&s;band, related all the Circum&s;tances with which the Reader hath already been acquainted; and at la&s;t concluded with her Hu&s;band's Confe&s;&s;ion of his Guilt.</P>
<P>Whether &s;he had forgiven him or no, I will not venture to determine: But it is certain, &s;he was an unwilling Witne&s;s in this Cau&s;e, and it is probable, from certain other Rea&s;ons would never have been brought to depo&s;e as &s;he did, had not Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> with great Art, fi&s;hed all out of her, at her own
<PB N="78" REF="93">
Hou&s;e, and had &s;he not indeed made Promi&s;es in Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Name, that the Puni&s;hment of her Hu&s;band &s;hould not be &s;uch as might any wi&s;e affect his Family.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting his Innocence, tho' he admitted he had made the above mentioned Confe&s;&s;ion; which he however endeavoured to ac|count for, by prote&s;ting that he was forced into it by the continued Importunity &s;he u&s;ed, who vowed, that as &s;he was &s;ure of his Guilt, &s;he would never leave tormenting him till he owned it, and faithfully promi&s;ed, that in &s;uch Ca&s;e, &s;he would never mention it to him more. Hence, he &s;aid, he had been induced fal&s;ely to confe&s;s him&s;elf guilty, tho' he was innocent; and that he believed he &s;hould have confe&s;t a Murder from the &s;ame Motive.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Partridge</HI> could not bear this Impudence with Patience; and having no other Remedy, in the pre|&s;ent Place but Tears, &s;he called forth a plentiful A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from them, and then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> &s;he &s;aid, (or rather cried) 'May it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, there never was any poor Woman &s;o injured as I am by that ba&s;e Man: For this is not the only In&s;tance of his Fal&s;hood to me. No, may it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, he hath injured my Bed many's the good time and often. I could have put up with his Drunkenne&s;s and neglect of his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s if he had not broke one of the &s;acred <HI>Command|ments.</HI> Be&s;ides, if it had been out of Doors I had not mattered it &s;o much; but with my own Ser|vant, in my own Hou&s;e, under my own Roof; to defile my own cha&s;te Bed, which to be &s;ure he hath with his bea&s;tly &s;tinking Whores. Yes, you Vil|lain, you have defiled my own Bed, you have; and then you have charged me with <HI>bullocking</HI> you into owning the Truth. It is very likely, an't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, that I &s;hould <HI>bullock</HI> him.&mdash;I have Marks enow about my Body to &s;hew of his

Cruelty to me. If you had been a Man, you Villain, you would have &s;corned to injure a Woman in that Manner. But you an't half a Man, you know it.&mdash;Nor have you been half a Hu&s;band to me. You need run after Whores, you need, when I'm &s;ure&mdash;And &s;ince he provokes me, I am ready an't plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, to take my bodily Oath, that I found them a-bed together. What, you have forgot, I &s;up|po&s;e when you beat me into a Fit, and made the Blood run down my Forehead, becau&s;e I only civil|ly taxed you with your Adultery! but I can prove it by all my Neighbours. You have almo&s;t broke my Heart, you, have, you have.'</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> interrupted, and begged her to be pacified, promi&s;ing her that &s;he &s;hould have Ju&s;|tice; then turning to <HI>Partridge,</HI> who &s;tood agha&s;t, one half of his Wits being hurried away by Surpri&s;e, and the other half by Fear, he &s;aid, he was &s;orry to &s;ee there was &s;o wicked a Man in the World. He a&s;&s;ured him, that his prevaricating and lying backward and forward was a great Aggravation of his Guilt: For which, the only Atonement he could make was by Confe&s;&s;ion and Repentance. He exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately confe&s;&s;ing the Fact, and not to per&s;i&s;t in denying what was &s;o plainly proved again&s;t him, even by his own Wife.</P>
<P>Here, Reader, I beg your Patience a Moment, while I make a ju&s;t Compliment to the great Wi&s;dom and Sagacity of our Law, which refu&s;es to admit the E|vidence of a Wife for or again&s;t her Hu&s;band. This, &s;ays a certain learned Author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in any but a Law-book, would be the Means of creating an eternal Di&s;&s;ention be|tween them. It would indeed, be the Means of much Perjury, and of much Whipping, Fining, Impri&s;on|ing, Tran&s;porting, and Hanging.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> &s;tood a while &s;ilent, till being bid to &s;peak, he &s;aid, he had already &s;poken the Truth, and ap|pealed
<PB N="80" REF="95">
to Heaven for his Innocence, and la&s;tly, to the Girl her&s;elf, whom he de&s;ired his Wor&s;hip immedi|ately to &s;end for; for he was ignorant, or at lea&s;t pre|tended to be &s;o, that &s;he had left that part of the Country.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who&s;e natural Love of Ju&s;tice, joined to his Coolne&s;s of Temper, made him always a mo&s;t patient Magi&s;trate in hearing all the Witne&s;&s;es which an accu&s;ed Per&s;on could produce in his Defence, agreed to defer his final Determination of this Mat|ter, till the Arrival of <HI>Jenny,</HI> for whom he immedi|ately di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger; and then having recom|mended Peace between <HI>Partridge</HI> and his Wife (tho' he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly to the wrong Per&s;on) he appointed them to attend again the third Day: For he had &s;ent <HI>Jenny</HI> a whole Day's Journey from his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At the appointed Time the Parties all a&s;&s;embled, when the Me&s;&s;enger returning brought Word, that <HI>Jenny</HI> was not to be found: for that &s;he had left her Habitation a few Days before, in company with a re|cruiting Officer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then declared, that the Evidence of &s;uch a Slut as &s;he appeared to be, would have de&s;erv|ed no Credit; but he &s;aid he could not help thinking that had &s;he been pre&s;ent, and would have declared the Truth, &s;he mu&s;t have confirmed what &s;o many Circum&s;tances, together with his own Confe&s;&s;ion, and the Declaration of his Wife, that &s;he had caught her Hu&s;band in the Fact, did &s;ufficiently prove. He therefore once more exhorted <HI>Partridge</HI> to confe&s;s; but he &s;till avowing his Innocence, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied of his Guilt, and that he was too bad a Man to receive any Encouragement from him. He therefore deprived him of his Annui|ty, and recommended Repentance to him, on account of another World, and Indu&s;try to maintain him&s;elf and his Wife in this.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="96">
There were not, perhaps, many more unhappy Per&s;ons, than poor <HI>Partridge.</HI> He had lo&s;t the be&s;t Part of his Income by the Evidence of his Wife, and yet was daily upbraided by her for having, among other Things, been the Occa&s;ion of de|priving her of that Benefit; but &s;uch was his For|tune, and he was obliged to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>Tho' I called him, poor <HI>Patridge,</HI> in the la&s;t Pa|ragraph, I would have the Reader rather impute that Epithet to the Compa&s;&s;ion in my Temper, than con|ceive it to be any Declaration of his Innocence. Whe|ther he was innocent or not, will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the Hi&s;toric-Mu&s;e hath entru&s;ted me with any Secrets, I will by no means be guilty of di&s;covering them till &s;he &s;hall give me leave.</P>
<P>Here therefore, the Reader mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend his Curio|&s;ity. Certain it is, that whatever was the Truth of the Ca&s;e, there was Evidence more than &s;ufficient to convict him before <HI>Allworthy;</HI> indeed much le&s;s would have &s;atisfied a Bench of Ju&s;tices on an Order of Ba&s;tardy; and yet, notwith&s;tanding the Po&s;itive|ne&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> who would have taken the Sacrament upon the Matter, there is a Po&s;&s;ibility that the Schoolma&s;ter was entirely innocent: For tho' it appeared clear, on comparing the Time when <HI>Jenny</HI> departed from <HI>Little Baddington,</HI> with that of her De|livery, that &s;he had there conceived this Infant, yet it by no means followed, of Nece&s;&s;ity, that <HI>Partridge</HI> mu&s;t have been its Father: For, to omit other Par|ticulars, there was in the &s;ame Hou&s;e a Lad near Eighteen, between whom, and <HI>Jenny,</HI> there had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted &s;ufficient Intimacy to found a rea&s;onable Su&s;pi|cion; and yet, &s;o blind is Jealou&s;y, this Circum|&s;tance never once entered into the Head of the enra|ged Wife.</P>
<P>Whether <HI>Partridge</HI> repented or not, according to Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Advice, is not &s;o apparent. Certain it is, that his Wife repented heartily of the Evidence
<PB N="82" REF="97">
&s;he had given again&s;t him; e&s;pecially when &s;he found Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> had deceived her, and refu&s;ed to make any Appliation to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> on her Behalf. She had, however, &s;omewhat better Succe&s;s with Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who was, as the Reader mu&s;t have per|ceived, a much better-tempered Woman; and very kindly undertook to &s;olicit her Brother to re&s;tore the Annuity. In which, tho' Good nature might have &s;ome Share, yet a &s;tronger and more natural Motive will appear in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Solicitations were neverthele&s;s un&s;ucce&s;sful: For tho' Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> did not think, with &s;ome late Writers, that Mercy con&s;i&s;ts only in puni&s;hing Offen|ders; yet he was as far from thinking that it is pro|per to this excellent Quality to pardon great Criminals wantonly, without any Rea&s;on whatever. Any Doubt|fulne&s;s of the Fact, or any Circum&s;tance of Mitigation was never di&s;regarded; but the Petitions of an Offen|der, or the Interce&s;&s;ions of others, did not in the lea&s;t affect him. In a word, he never pardoned, becau&s;e the offender him&s;elf, or his Friends, were unwilling that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> and his Wife were therefore both obliged to &s;ubmit to their Fate; which was indeed &s;evere e|nough; For &s;o far was he from doubling his Indu&s;try on the account of his le&s;&s;ened Income, that he did in a manner abandon him&s;elf to de&s;pair; and as he was by Nature indolent, that Vice now increa&s;ed upon him, by which means he lo&s;t the little School he had; &s;o that neither his Wife nor him&s;elf would have had any Bread to eat, had not the Charity of &s;ome good Chri&s;tian interpo&s;ed, and provided them with what was ju&s;t &s;ufficient for their Su&s;tenance.</P>
<P>As this Support was conveyed to them by an un|known Hand, they imagined, and &s;o, I doubt not, will the Reader, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf was their &s;ecret Benefactor; who, though he would not openly encourage Vice, could yet privately relieve the Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="83" REF="98">
of the Vicious them&s;elves, when the&s;e became too exqui&s;ite and di&s;proportionate to their Merit. In which Light, their Wretchedne&s;s appeared now to Fortune her&s;elf; for &s;he at length took pity on this mi&s;erable Couple, and con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened the wretch|ed State of <HI>Partridge,</HI> by putting a final end to that of his Wife, who &s;oon after caught the Small-pox, and died.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had executed on <HI>Partridge,</HI> at fir&s;t met with univer&s;al Approbation; but no &s;ooner had he felt its Con&s;equences, than his Neighbours began to relent, and to compa&s;&s;ionate his Ca&s;e; and pre&s;ently after, to blame that as Rigour and Severity, which they before called Ju&s;tice. They now exclaimed again&s;t puni&s;hing in cold Blood, and &s;ang forth the Prai&s;es of Mercy and Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cries were con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the Death of Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> which, tho' owing to the Di&s;temper above mentioned, which is no Con&s;equence of Poverty or Di&s;tre&s;s, many were not a&s;hamed to impute to Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Severity, or, as they now termed it, Cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge,</HI> having now lo&s;t his Wife, his School, and his Annuity, and the unknown Per&s;on having now di&s;continued the la&s;t mentioned Charity, re&s;olved to change the Scene, and left the Country, where he was in Danger of &s;tarving with the univer&s;al Com|pa&s;&s;ion of all his Neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A &s;hort Sketch of that Felicity which prudent Couples may extract from Hatred; with a &s;hort Apology for tho&s;e People who overlook Imperfections in their Friends.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THO' the Captain had effectually demoli&s;hed poor <HI>Partridge,</HI> yet had he not reaped the Har|ve&s;t he hoped for, which was to turn the Foundling out of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="99">
On the contrary, that Gentleman grew every Day fonder of little <HI>Tommy,</HI> as if he intended to counter|balance his Severity to the Father with extraordinary Fondne&s;s and Affection towards the Son.</P>
<P>This a good deal &s;oured the Captain's Temper, as did all the other daily In&s;tances of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Genero&s;ity: For he looked on all &s;uch Large&s;&s;es to be Diminutions of his own Wealth.</P>
<P>In this, we have &s;aid, he did not agree with his Wife; nor indeed, in any thing el&s;e: For tho' an Affection placed on the Under&s;tanding is by many wife Per&s;ons thought much more durable than that which is founded on Beauty, yet it happened other|wi&s;e in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. Nay, the Under&s;tandings of this Couple were their principal Bone of Contenti|on, and one great Cau&s;e of many Quarrels which from time to time aro&s;e between them; and which at la&s;t ended, on the Side of the Lady, in a &s;overeign Con|tempt for her Hu&s;band, and on the Hu&s;band's, in an utter Abhorrence of his Wife.</P>
<P>As the&s;e had both exerci&s;ed their Talents chiefly in the Study of Divinity, this was, from their fir&s;t Acquaintance, the mo&s;t common Topic of Conver|&s;ation between them. The Captain, like a well-bred Man, had, before Marriage, always given up his Opinion to that of the Lady; and this, not in the clum&s;y, aukward Manner of a conceited Blockhead, who' while he civilly yields to a Superiour in an Ar|gument, is de&s;irous of being &s;till known to think him|&s;elf in the Right. The Captain, on the contrary, tho' one of the proude&s;t Fellows in the World, &s;o ab&s;olutely yielded the Victory to his Antagoni&s;t, that &s;he, who had not the lea&s;t Doubt of his Sincerity, retired always from the Di&s;pute with an Admiration of her own Under&s;tanding, and a Love for his.</P>
<P>But tho' this Complai&s;ance to one whom the Cap|tain thoroughly de&s;pi&s;ed, was not &s;o unea&s;y to him, as it would have been, had any Hopes of Preferment
<PB N="85" REF="100">
made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the &s;ame Submi&s;&s;ion to a <HI>Hoadley,</HI> or to &s;ome other of great Reputation in the Science, yet even this co&s;t him too much to be endu|red without &s;ome Motive. Matrimony, therefore, hav|ing removed all &s;uch Motives, he grew weary of this Conde&s;cention, and began to treat the Opinions of his Wife with that Haughtine&s;s and In&s;olence, which none but tho&s;e who de&s;erve &s;ome Contempt them&s;elves can be&s;tow, and tho&s;e only who de&s;erve no Contempt can bear.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Torrent of Tenderne&s;s was over, and when in the calm and long Interval between the Fits, Rea&s;on began to open the Eyes of the Lady, and &s;he &s;aw this Alteration of Behaviour in the Captain, who at length an&s;wered all her Arguments only with Pi&s;h and P&s;haw, &s;he was far from enduring the In|dignity with a tame Submi&s;&s;ion. Indeed, it at fir&s;t &s;o highly provoked her, that it might have produced &s;ome tragical Event, had it not taken a more harmle&s;s Turn, by filling her with the utmo&s;t Contempt for her Hu&s;band's Under&s;tanding, which &s;omewhat qua|lified her Hatred towards him; tho' of this likewi&s;e, &s;he had a pretty moderate Share.</P>
<P>The Captain's Hatred to her was of a purer Kind: For as to any Imperfections in her Knowledge or Un|der&s;tanding, he no more de&s;pi&s;ed her for them than for her not being &s;ix Feet high. In his Opinion of the female Sex, he exceeded the Moro&s;ene&s;s of <HI>Ari&s;|totle</HI> him&s;elf. He looked on a Woman as on an A|nimal of dome&s;tic U&s;e, of &s;omewhat higher Con&s;i|deration than a Cat, &s;ince her Offices were of rather more Importance; but the Difference between the&s;e two, was in his E&s;timation &s;o &s;mall, that in his Mar|riage contracted with Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Lands and Tenements, it would have been pretty equal which of them he had taken into the Bargain. And yet &s;o tender was his Pride, that it felt the Contempt which his Wife now began to expre&s;s towards him; and
<PB N="86" REF="101">
this, added to the Surfeit he had before taken of her Love, created in him a Degree of Di&s;gu&s;t and Abhor|rence, perhaps hardly to be exceeded.</P>
<P>One Situation only of the married State is exclud|ed from Plea&s;ure; and that is, a State of Indifference; but as many of my Readers, I hope, know what an exqui&s;ite Delight there is in conveying Plea&s;ure to a beloved Object, &s;o &s;ome few, I am afraid, may have experienced the Satisfaction of tormenting one we hate. It is, I apprehend, to come at this latter Plea|&s;ure, that we &s;ee both Sexes often give up that Ea&s;e in Marriage, which they might otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s, tho' their Mate was never &s;o di&s;agreeable to them. Hence the Wife often puts on Fits of Love and Jealou&s;y, nay, even denies her&s;elf any Plea&s;ure, to di&s;turb and prevent tho&s;e of her Hu&s;band; and he again, in re|turn, puts frequent Re&s;traints on him&s;elf, and &s;tays at home in Company which he di&s;likes, in order to con|fine his Wife to what &s;he equally dete&s;ts. Hence too mu&s;t flow tho&s;e Tears which a Widow &s;ome|times &s;o plentifully &s;heds over the A&s;hes of a Hu&s;|band with whom &s;he led a Life of con&s;tant Di&s;quiet and Turbulency, and whom now &s;he can never hope to torment any more.</P>
<P>But if ever any Couple enjoyed this Plea&s;ure, it was at pre&s;ent experienced by the Captain and his Lady. It was always a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to either of them to be ob&s;tinate in any Opinion, that the other had previou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the contrary. If the one pro|po&s;ed any Amu&s;ement, the other con&s;tantly objected to it. They never loved or hated, commended or abu&s;ed the &s;ame Per&s;on. And for this Rea&s;on, as the Captain looked with an evil Eye on the little Found|ling, his Wife began now to care&s;s it almo&s;t equally with her own Child.</P>
<P>The Reader will be apt to conceive, that this Be|haviour between the Hu&s;band and Wife did not greatly contribute to Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Repo&s;e, as it
<PB N="87" REF="102">
tended &s;o little to that &s;erene Happine&s;s which he had propo&s;ed to all three, from this Alliance; but the Truth is, though he might be a little di&s;appoint|ed in his &s;anguine Expectations, yet he was far from being acquainted with the whole Matter: For, as the Captain was, from certain obvious Rea&s;ons, much on his Guard before him, the Lady was obliged, for fear of her Brother's Di&s;plea&s;ure, to pur&s;ue the &s;ame Conduct. In fact, it is po&s;&s;ible for a third Per&s;on to be very intimate, nay even to live long in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, with a married Couple, who have any tole|rable Di&s;cretion, and not even gue&s;s at the four Sen|timents which they bear to each other: For though the whole Day may be &s;ometimes too &s;hort for Hatred, as well as for Love: yet the many Hours which they naturally &s;pend together, apart from all Ob&s;ervers, &s;upply People of tolerable Moderation with &s;uch ample Opportunity for the Enjoyment of either Pa&s;&s;ion, that, if they love, they can &s;upport be|ing a few Hours in Company, without toying, or if they hate, without &s;pitting in each others Faces.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, however, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;aw enough to render him a little unea&s;y; for we are not always to conclude, that a wi&s;e Man is not hurt, be|cau&s;e he doth not cry out and lament him&s;elf, like tho&s;e of a childi&s;h or effeminate Temper. But in|deed it is po&s;&s;ible he might &s;ee &s;ome Faults in the Captain, without any Unea&s;ine&s;s at all: For Men of true Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s are contented to take Per&s;ons and Things as they are, without complaining of their Imperfections, or attempting to amend them. They can &s;ee a Fault in a Friend, a Relation, or an Accquaintance, without ever mentioning it to the Parties them&s;elves, or any others; and this often without the lea&s;t le&s;&s;ening their Affection. Indeed unle&s;s great Di&s;cernment be tempered with this overlooking Di&s;po&s;ition, we ought never to contract Friend&s;hip but with a Degree of Folly which we can
<PB N="88" REF="103">
deceive: For I hope my Friends will pardon me, when I declare I know none of them without a Fault; and I &s;hould be &s;orry if I could imagine I had any Friend who could not &s;ee mine. Forgivene&s;s, of this Kind, we give and demand in Turn. It is an Exerci&s;e of Friend&s;hip, and, perhaps, none of the lea&s;t plea&s;ant. And this Forgivene&s;s we mu&s;t be&s;tow, without De&s;ire of Amendment. There is, perhaps, no &s;urer Mark of Folly, than an Attempt to correct the natural Infirmities of tho&s;e we love. The fine&s;t Compo&s;ition of human Nature, as well as the fine&s;t China, may have a Flaw in it; and this, I am afraid, in either Ca&s;e, is equally incurable; though, never|thele&s;s, the Pattern may remain of the highe&s;t Value.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> certainly &s;aw &s;ome Imperfections in the Captain; but, as this was a very artful Man, and eternally upon his Guard be|fore him, the&s;e appeared to him no more than Ble|mi&s;hes in a good Character, which his Goodne&s;s made him overlook, and his Wi&s;dom prevented him from di&s;covering to the Captain him&s;elf. Very different would have been his Sentiments, had he di&s;covered the whole; which, perhaps, would, in Time, have been the Ca&s;e, had the Husband and Wife long con|tinued this Kind of Behaviour to each other; but this kind Fortune took effectual Means to prevent, by for|cing the Captain to do that which rendered him again dear to his Wife, and re&s;tored all her Tenderne&s;s and Affection towards him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Receipt to regain the lo&s;t Affections of a Wife, which hath never been known to fail in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;es.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Captain was made large Amends for the unplea&s;ant Minutes which he pa&s;&s;ed in the Con|ver&s;ation of his Wife (and which were as few as he
<PB N="89" REF="104">
could contrive to make them) by the plea&s;ant Medita|tions he enjoyed when alone.</P>
<P>The&s;e Meditations were entirely employed on Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Fortune; for fir&s;t, he exerci&s;ed much Thought in calculating, as well as he could, the exact Value of the whole; which Calculations he often &s;aw Occa&s;ion to alter in his own Favour: And &s;econdly, and chiefly, he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with intended Altera|tions in the Hou&s;e and Gardens, and in projecting ma|ny other Schemes, as well for Improvement of the E&s;tate, as of the Grandeur of the Place. For this Purpo&s;e he applied him&s;elf to the Studies of Archi|tecture and Gardening, and read over many Books on both tho&s;e Subjects; for the&s;e Sciences, indeed, em|ployed his whole Time, and formed his only amu&s;e|ment. He at la&s;t completed a mo&s;t excellent Plan; and very &s;orry we are, that it is not in our Power to pre&s;ent it to our Reader, &s;ince even the Luxury of the pre&s;ent Age, I believe would hardly match it. It had, indeed, in a &s;uperlative Degree, the two principal In|gredients which &s;erve to recommend all great and no|ble De&s;igns of this Nature: For it required an immo|derate Expence to execute, and a va&s;t Length of Time to bring it to any Sort of Perfection. The former of the&s;e, the immen&s;e Wealth of which the Captain &s;up|po&s;ed Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of inheriting, promi&s;ed very effectually to &s;upply; and the latter, the Soundne&s;s of his own Con&s;titution, and his Time of Life, which was only what is called Middle Age, removed all Apprehen|&s;ion of his not living to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>Nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate Execution of this Plan, but the Death of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> in calculating which he had em|ployed much of his own Algebra; be&s;ides purcha&s;ing every Book extant that treats of the Value of Lives, Rever&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From all which, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf, that as he had every Day a Chance of this happening,
<PB N="90" REF="105">
&s;o had he more than an even Chance of its happening within a few Years.</P>
<P>But while the Captain was one Day bu&s;ied in deep Contemplations of this Kind, one of the mo&s;t unlucky as well as un&s;ea&s;onable Accidents, happened to him. The utmo&s;t Malice of Fortune could indeed have con|trived nothing &s;o cruel, &s;o mal-a-propos, &s;o ab&s;olute|ly de&s;tructive to all his Schemes. In &s;hort, not to keep the Reader in long Su&s;pence, ju&s;t at the very In&s;tant when his Heart was exulting in Meditations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Happine&s;s which would accrue to him by Mr. <HI>All|worthy'</HI>s Death, he him&s;elf&mdash;died of an Apoplexy.</P>
<P>This unfortunately befel the Captain as he was tak|ing his Evening Walk by him&s;elf, &s;o that no Body was pre&s;ent to lend him any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if indeed any A&s;&s;i&s;tance could have pre&s;erved him. He took, there|fore, Mea&s;ure of that Proportion of Soil, which was now become adequate to all his future Purpo&s;es, and he lay dead on the Ground, a great (though not a living) Example of the Truth of that Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Horace:</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Proof of the Infallibility of the foregoing Receipt, in the Lamentations of the Widow; with other &s;uitable Decorations of Death, &s;uch as Phy&s;icians,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and an Epitaph in the true Stile.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> his Si&s;ter, and another Lady, were a&s;&s;embled at the accu&s;tomed Hour in the Supper Room, where having waited a con&s;iderable
<PB N="91" REF="106">
Time longer than u&s;ual, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> fir&s;t declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e began to grow unea&s;y at the Captain's Stay; (for he was always mo&s;t punctual at his Meals,) and gave Orders that the Bell &s;hould be rung without the Doors, and e&s;pecially towards tho&s;e Walks which the Captain was wont to u&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Summons proving ineffectual, (for the Captain had, by perver&s;e Accident, betaken him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> a new Walk that Evening,) Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> declared &s;he was &s;eriou&s;ly frightned. Upon which the other Lady, who was one of her mo&s;t intimate Acquaintance, and who well knew the true State of her Affections, en|deavoured all &s;he could to pacify her; telling her&mdash;&s;o be &s;ure &s;he could not help being unea&s;y; but that &s;he &s;hould hope the be&s;t. That, perhaps, the Sweetne&s;s of the Evening had enticed the Captain to go farther than his u&s;ual Walk, or he might be detained at &s;ome Neighbour's. Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> an&s;wered, No; &s;he was are &s;ome Accident had befallen him; for that he would never &s;tay out without &s;ending her Word, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t know how unea&s;y it would make her. The other Lady, having no other Arguments to u&s;e, be|took her&s;elf to the Entreaties u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and begged her not to frighten her&s;elf, for it might be of very ill Con&s;equence to her own Health; and, fill|ing out a very large Gla&s;s of Wine, advi&s;ed, and at la&s;t prevailed with her to drink it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> now returned into the Parlour; for he had been him&s;elf in Search after the Captain. His Countenance &s;ufficiently &s;hewed the Con&s;ternation he was under, which indeed had a good deal deprived him of Speech; but as Grief operates variou&s;ly on different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">linds, &s;o the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ion which depre&s;&s;ed his Voice, elevated that of Mrs. <HI>Blifil.</HI> She now began to bewail her&s;elf in very bitter Terms, and Floods of Tears accompanied her Lamentations, which the Lady, her Companion, declared &s;he could not blame; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut at the &s;ame Time di&s;&s;uaded her from indulging;
<PB N="92" REF="107">
attempting to moderate the Grief of her Friend, by philo&s;ophical Ob&s;ervations on the many Di&s;appoint+ments to which human Life is daily &s;ubject, which &s;he &s;aid, was a &s;ufficient Con&s;ideration to fortify on Minds again&s;t any Accidents, how &s;udden or terrible &s;oever. She &s;aid, her Brother's Example ought to teach her Patience, who, though indeed he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed as much concerned as her&s;elf, yet was doubtle&s;s very unea&s;y, though his Re&s;ignation to the Di+vine Will had re&s;trained his Grief within due Bounds. 'Mention not my Brother,' &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'alone am the Object of your Pity. What are the Terrors of Friend&s;hip to what a Wife feels on the&s;e Occa&s;ions? O he is lo&s;t! Somebody hath murder+ed him&mdash;I &s;hall never &s;ee him more'&mdash;Here Torrent of Tears had the &s;ame Con&s;equence with what the Suppre&s;&s;ion had occa&s;ioned to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and &s;he remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At this Interval, a Servant came running in, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Breath, and cried out, the Captain was found; and, before he could proceed farther, he was follow+ed by two more, bearing the dead Body between them.</P>
<P>Here the curious Reader may ob&s;erve, another Diver&s;ity in the Operations of Grief: For as Mr. <HI>All+worthy</HI> had been before &s;ilent, from the &s;ame Cau&s;e which had made his Si&s;ter vociferous; &s;o did the pre|&s;ent Sight, which drew Tears from the Gentleman, put an entire Stop to tho&s;e of the Lady; who fir&s;t gave a violent Scream, and pre&s;ently after fell into a Fit.</P>
<P>The Room was &s;oon full of Servants, &s;ome of whom, with the Lady vi&s;itant, were employed in Care of the Wife, and others, with Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying off the Captain to a warm Bed, where every Method was tried, in order to re&s;tore him to Life.</P>

Hence aro&s;e a Di&s;pute between the learned Men, which each delivered the Rea&s;ons of their &s;everal Opi|nions. The&s;e were of &s;uch equal Force, that they &s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">th to confirm either Doctor in his own Sentiments, and made not the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on his Adver&s;ary.

the Occa&s;&s;ion of his Death; but in reality, all &s;uch Experiments had been made before their Arrival: Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Captain was put into a warm Bed, had his Vei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;carified, his Forehead chafed, and all Sorts of &s;tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> Drops applied to his Lips and his No&s;trils.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians, therefore, finding them&s;elves an|ticipated in every thing they ordered, were at a Lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> how to employ that Portion of Time which it is u&s;e &s;ual and decent to remain for their Fee, and wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;itated to find &s;ome Subject or other for Di&s;|cour&s;e; and what could more naturally pre&s;ent it&s;elf than that before-mentioned?</P>

<P>This Lady was now recovered of her Fit, and, to u&s;e the common Phra&s;e, as well as could be expected for one in her Condition.

<P>THE Reader will be well plea&s;ed to remember, that at the Beginning of the Second Book of this Hi&s;tory, we gave him a Hint of our Intention to pa&s;s over &s;everal large Periods of Time, in which nothing happened worthy of being recorded in a Chro|nicle of this Kind.</P>
<P>In &s;o doing, we do not only con&s;ult our own Dig|nity and Ea&s;e; but the Good and Advantage of the Reader: For be&s;ides, that by the&s;e Means we prevent him from throwing away his Time in reading with|out either Plea&s;ure or Emolument, we gave him at
<PB N="98" REF="113">
all &s;uch Sea&s;ons an Opportunity of employing that wonderful Sagacity, of which he is Ma&s;ter, by filling up the&s;e vacant Spaces of Time with his own Con|jectures; for which Purpo&s;e, we have taken care to qualify him in the preceding Pages.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, what Reader but knows that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> felt at fir&s;t for the Lo&s;s of his Friend, tho&s;e Emotions of Grief, which on &s;uch Occa&s;ions enter into all Men who&s;e Hearts are not compo&s;ed of Flint, or their Heads of as &s;olid Materials? Again, what Reader doth not know that Philo&s;ophy and Religion, in time, moderated, and at la&s;t extingui&s;hed this Grief? The former of the&s;e, teaching the Folly and Vanity of it, and the latter, correcting it, as un|lawful, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uaging it by rai&s;ing future Hopes and A&s;&s;urances which enable a &s;trong and religious Mind to take leave of a Friend on his Death-bed with little le&s;s indifference than if he was preparing for a long Journey; and indeed with little le&s;s Hope of &s;eeing him again.</P>
<P>Nor can the judicious Reader be at a greater Lo&s;s on Account of Mrs. <HI>Bridget Blifil,</HI> who, he may be a&s;&s;ured, conducted her&s;elf through the whole Sea&s;on in which Grief is to make its Appearance on the out|&s;ide of the Body, with the &s;tricte&s;t Regard to all the Rules of Cu&s;tom and Decency, &s;uiting the Alterations of her Countenance to the &s;everal Alterations of her Habit: For as this changed from Weeds to Black, from Black to Grey, from Grey to White, &s;o did her Counte|nance change from Di&s;mal to Sorrowful, from Sorrow|ful to Sad, and from Sad to Serious, till the Day came in which &s;he was allowed to return to her former Se|renity.</P>
<P>We have mentioned the&s;e two as Examples only of the Ta&s;k which may be impo&s;ed on Readers of the lowe&s;t Cla&s;s. Much higher and harder Exerci&s;es of Judgment and Penetration may rea&s;onably be ex|pected from the upper Graduates in Critici&s;m. Ma|by

notable Di&s;coveries will, I doubt not, be made by &s;uch, of the Tran&s;actions which happened in the Family of our worthy Man, during all the Years which we have thought proper to pa&s;s over: For tho' nothing worthy of a Place in this Hi&s;tory occurred within that Period; yet did &s;everal Incidents happen, of equal Importance with tho&s;e reported by the daily and Weekly Hi&s;torians of the Age, in reading which, great Numbers of Per&s;ons con&s;ume a con&s;iderable Part of their Time, very little, I am afraid, to their Emolument. Now, in the Conjectures here pro|po&s;ed, &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent Faculties of the Mind may be employed to much Advantage, &s;ince it is a more u&s;eful Capacity to be able to foretel the Actions of Men in any Circum&s;tance from their Cha|racters; than to judge of their Characters from their Actions. The former, I own, requires the greater Penetration; but may be accompli&s;hed by true Sa|gacity, with no le&s;s certainty than the latter.</P>
<P>As we are &s;en&s;ible that much the greate&s;t Part of our Readers are very eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Qua|lity, we have left them a Space of twelve Years to exert it in; and &s;hall now bring forth our Hero, at about fourteen Years of Age, not que&s;tioning that many have been long impatient to be introduced to his Acquaintance.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Hero of this great Hi&s;tory appears with very bad Omens. A little Tale, of &s;o</HI> LOW <HI>a Kind, that &s;ome may think it not worth their Notice. A Word or two concerning a Squire, and more relating to a Game-keeper and a Schoolma&s;ter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS we determined when we fir&s;t &s;at down to write this Hi&s;tory, to flatter no Man; but to guide our Pen throughout by the Directions of Truth, we are obliged to bring our Hero on the Stage in a much more di&s;advantageous Manner than we could wi&s;h;
<PB N="100" REF="115">
and to declare hone&s;tly, even at his fir&s;t Appearance, that it was the univer&s;al Opinion of all Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy'</HI>s Family, that he was certainly born to be hanged.</P>
<P>Indeed, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, there was too much Rea&s;on for this Conjecture. The Lad having, from his earlie&s;t Years, di&s;covered a Propen&s;ity to many Vices, and e&s;pecially to one, which hath as direct a Tendency as any other to that Fate, which we have ju&s;t now ob&s;erved to have been prophetically de|nounced again&s;t him. He had been already convicted of three Robberies, <HI>viz.</HI> of robbing an Orchard, of &s;tealing a Duck out of a Farmer's Yard, and of pick|ing Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Pocket of a Ball.</P>
<P>The Vices of this young Man were moreover heightened by the di&s;advantageous Light in which they appeared, when oppo&s;ed to the Virtues of Ma&s;ter <HI>Bli|fil,</HI> his Companion: A Youth of &s;o different a Ca&s;t from little <HI>Jones,</HI> that not only the Family, but all the Neighbourhood re&s;ounded his Prai&s;es. He was indeed a Lad of a remarkable Di&s;po&s;ition; &s;ober, di&s;|creet, and pious beyond his Age. Qualities, which gained him the Love of every one who knew him, while <HI>Tom Jones</HI> was univer&s;ally di&s;liked, and many expre&s;&s;ed their Wonder that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> would &s;uf|fer &s;uch a Lad to be educated with his Nephew, le&s;t the Morals of the latter &s;hould be corrupted by his Example.</P>
<P>An Incident which happened about this Time, will &s;et the Characters of the&s;e two Lads, more fairly be|fore the di&s;cerning Reader, than is in the Power of the longe&s;t Di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Jones,</HI> who, bad as he is, mu&s;t &s;erve for the Heroe of this Hi&s;tory, had only one Friend among all the Servants of the Family; for, as to Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> &s;he had long &s;ince given him up, and was perfectly reconciled to her Mi&s;tre&s;s. This Friend was the Game-keeper, a Fellow of a loo&s;e kind of Di&s;po&s;ition and who was thought not to entertain much &s;trict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">

Notions concerning the Difference of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> than the young Gentleman him&s;elf. And hence, this Friend&s;hip gave Occa&s;ion to many &s;arca&s;tical Re|marks among the Dome&s;tics, mo&s;t of which were either Proverbs before, or at lea&s;t are become &s;o now; and indeed, the Wit of them all may be compri&s;ed in that &s;hort <HI>I atin</HI> Proverb, <HI>"No&s;citur a &s;ocio,"</HI> which I think, is thus expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> "You may know him by the Company he keeps."</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, &s;ome of that atrocious Wicked|ne&s;s in <HI>Jones,</HI> of which we have ju&s;t mentioned three Examples, might perhaps be derived from the Encou|ragement he had received from this Fellow, who, in two or three In&s;tances, had been what the Law calls an Acce&s;&s;ary after the Fact. For the whole Duck, and great Part of the Apples were converted to the U&s;e of the Game-keeper and his Family. Tho' as <HI>Jones</HI> alone was di&s;covered, the poor Lad bore not only the whole Smart, but the whole Blame; both which fell again to his Lot, on the following Occa&s;ion. Contiguous to Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s E&s;tate, was the Ma|nor of one of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are called <HI>Pre|&s;ervers of the Game.</HI> This Species of Men, from the great Severity with which they revenge the Death of a Hare or a Partridge, might be thought to culti|vate the &s;ame Super&s;tition with the Bannians in <HI>India;</HI> many of whom, we are told, dedicate their whole Lives to the Pre&s;ervation and Protection of certain Animals, was it not that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bannians, while they pre&s;erve them from other Enemies, will mo&s;t unmercifully &s;laughter whole Hor&s;e-loads them&s;elves, &s;o that they &s;tand clearly acquitted of any &s;uch heathen|i&s;h Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>I have indeed, a much better Opinion of this Kind of Men than is entertained by &s;ome, as I take them to an&s;wer the Order of Nature, and the good Pur|po&s;es for which they were ordained in a more ample
<PB N="102" REF="117">
Manner than many others. Now, as <HI>Horace</HI> tells us, that there are a &s;et of human Beings,</P>
<Q>'Fruges con&s;umere nati</Q>
<P>'Born to con&s;ume the Fruits of the Earth.' So, I make no manner of Doubt but that there are others</P>
<Q>'Feras con&s;umere nati.</Q>
<P>'Born to con&s;ume the Bea&s;ts of the Field,' or, as it is commonly called, the Game; and none I believe, will deny, but that tho&s;e Squires fulfil this End of their Creation.</P>
<P>Little <HI>Jones</HI> went one Day a &s;hooting with the Game-keeper; when, happening to &s;pring a Covey of Partridges, near the Border of that Manor, over which Fortune, to fulfil the wi&s;e Purpo&s;es of Nature, had planted one of the Game-Con&s;umers, the Birds flew into it, and were <HI>marked</HI> (as it is called) by the two Sport&s;men, in &s;ome Furze Bu&s;hes, about two or three hundred Paces beyond Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Domi|nions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had given the Fellow &s;trict Orders, on Pain of forfeiting his Place, never to tre&s;pa&s;s on any of his Neighbours, no more on tho&s;e who were le&s;s rigid in this Matter, than on the Lord of this Manor. With regard to others, indeed, the&s;e Or|ders had not been always very &s;crupulou&s;ly kept; but as the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Gentleman with whom the Partridges had taken &s;auctuary, was well known, the Game-keeper had never yet attempted to invade his Territories. Nor had he done it now, had not the younger Sport&s;man, who was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively eager to pur&s;ue the flying Game, over-per&s;uaded him; but <HI>Jones</HI> being very importunate, the other, who was him&s;elf keen enough after the Sport, yielded to his Per&s;ua&s;ions, entered the Manor, and &s;hot one of the Partridges.</P>
<P>The Gentleman him&s;elf was at that time on hor&s;e|back, at a little Di&s;tance from them; and hearing the Gun go off, he immediately made towards the Place,
<PB N="103" REF="118">
and di&s;covered poor <HI>Tom:</HI> For the Game-keeper had leapt into the thicke&s;t Part of the Furze-brake, where he had happily concealed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Gentleman having &s;earched the Lad, and found the Partridge upon him, denounced great Vengeance, &s;wearing he would acquaint Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He was as good as his Word, for he rode immediately to his Hou&s;e, and complained of the Tre&s;pa&s;s on his Manor, in as high Terms, and as bitter Language, as if his Hou&s;e had been broken open, and the mo&s;t valuable Furniture &s;tole out of it. He added, that &s;ome other Per&s;on was in his Company, tho' he could not di&s;cover him: for that two Guns had been di&s;charged almo&s;t in the &s;ame In&s;tant. And, &s;ays he, 'we have found only this Partridge, but the Lord knows what Mi&s;chief they have done.'</P>
<P>At his Return home, <HI>Tom</HI> was pre&s;ently convened before Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He owned the Fact, and al|ledged no other Excu&s;e but what was really true, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Covey was originally &s;prung in Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s own Manor.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> was then interrogated who was with him, which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> declared he was re&s;olved to know, acquainting the Culprit with the Circum&s;tance of the two Guns, which had been depo&s;ed by the Squire and both his Servants; but <HI>Tom</HI> &s;toutly per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;|&s;erting that he was alone; yet, to &s;ay the Truth, he he&s;itated a little at fir&s;t, which would have confirmed Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Belief, had what the Squire and his Servants &s;aid, wanted any further Confirmation.</P>
<P>The Game-keeper being a &s;u&s;pected Per&s;on, was now &s;ent for, and the Que&s;tion put to him; but he, relying on the Promi&s;e which <HI>Tom</HI> had made him, to take all upon him&s;elf, very re&s;olutely denied being in Company with the young Gentleman, or indeed hav|ing &s;een him the whole Afternoon.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then turned towards <HI>Tom,</HI> with more than u&s;ual Anger in his Countenance, and ad|vi&s;ed
<PB N="104" REF="119">
him to confe&s;s who was with him; repeating, that he was re&s;olved to know. The Lad, however, &s;till maintained his Re&s;olution, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with much Wrath by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who told him, he &s;hould have to the next Morning to con&s;ider of it, when he &s;hould be que&s;tioned by another Per&s;on and in another Manner.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Jones</HI> &s;pent a very melancholy Night, and the more &s;o, as he was without his u&s;ual Companion: for Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> was gone abroad on a vi&s;it with his Mother. Fear of the Puni&s;hment he was to &s;uffer was on this Occa&s;ion his lea&s;t Evil; his chief Anxi|ety being, le&s;t his Con&s;tancy &s;hould fail him, and he &s;hould be brought to betray the Game-keeper, who&s;e Ruin he knew mu&s;t now be the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Nor did the Game-keeper pa&s;s his Time much bet|ter. He had the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions with the Youth; for who&s;e Honour he had likewi&s;e a much tenderer Regard than for his Skin.</P>
<P>In the Morning, when <HI>Tom</HI> attended the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thwackum,</HI> the Per&s;on to whom Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had committed the In&s;truction of the two Boys, he had the &s;ame Que&s;tions put to him by that Gentleman, which he had been asked the Evening before, to which he returned the &s;ame An&s;wers. The Con&s;e|quence of this was, &s;o &s;evere a Whipping, that it po&s;&s;ibly fell little &s;hort of the Torture with which Con|fe&s;&s;ions are in &s;ome Countries extorted from Criminals.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> bore his Puni&s;hment with great Re&s;olution; and tho' his Ma&s;ter asked him between every Stroke, whether he would not confe&s;s, he was contented to be flead rather than betray his Friend, or break the Promi&s;e he had made.</P>
<P>The Game-keeper was now relieved from his Anx|iety, and Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf began to be concern|ed at <HI>Tom'</HI>s Sufferings: For, be&s;ides that Mr. <HI>Thwac|kum,</HI> being highly enraged that he was not able to make the Boy &s;ay what he him&s;elf plea&s;ed, had car|ried
<PB N="105" REF="120">
his Severity much beyond the good Man's Inten|tion, this latter began now to &s;u&s;pect that the Squire had been mi&s;taken; which his Extreme Eagerne&s;s and Anger &s;eemed to make probable; and as for what the Servants had &s;aid in Confirmation of their Ma&s;ter's Account, he laid no great Stre&s;s upon that. Now, as Cruelty and Inju&s;tice were two Ideas, of which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> could by no Means &s;upport the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s a &s;ingle Moment, he &s;ent for <HI>Tom,</HI> and af|ter many kind and Friendly Exhortations, &s;aid, 'I am convinced, my dear Child, that my Su&s;picions have wronged you; I am &s;orry that you have been &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed on this Account.'&mdash;And at la&s;t gave him a little Hor&s;e to make him amends; again repeating his Sorrow for what had pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Tom'</HI>s Guilt now flew in his Face more than any Severity could make it. He could more ea&s;ily bear the La&s;hes of <HI>Thwackum,</HI> than the Genero&s;ity of <HI>Allworthy.</HI> The Tears bur&s;t from his Eyes, and he fell upon his Knees, crying, 'Oh! Sir, you are too good to me. Indeed, you are. Indeed, I don't de&s;erve it.' And at that very In&s;tant, from the Fullne&s;s of his Heart, had almo&s;t betrayed the Secret; but the good Genius of the Game-keeper &s;ugge&s;ted to him what might be the Con&s;equence to the poor Fel|low, and this Con&s;ideration &s;ealed his Lips.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> did all he could to di&s;&s;uade <HI>Allworthy</HI> from &s;hewing any Compa&s;&s;ion or Kindne&s;s to the Boy, &s;aying, 'He had per&s;i&s;ted in an Untruth;' and gave &s;ome Hints, that a &s;econd Whipping might pro|bably bring the Matter to Light.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the Experiment. He &s;aid, the Boy had &s;uffered enough already, for concealing the Truth, even if he was guilty, &s;eeing that he could have no Motive but a mi&s;taken Point of Honour for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Honour! cry'd <HI>Thwackum,</HI> with &s;ome Warmth, mere Stubborne&s;s and Ob&s;tinacy! Can Honour teach
<PB N="106" REF="121">
any one to tell a Lie, or can any Honour exi&s;t inde|pendent of Religion?</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e happened at Table when Dinner was ju&s;t ended; and there were pre&s;ent Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thwackum,</HI> and a third Gentleman who entered into the Debate, and whom, before we proceed any farther, we &s;hall briefly introduce to our Reader's Acquaintance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Character of Mr.</HI> Square <HI>the Philo&s;opher, and of Mr.</HI> Thwackum <HI>the Divine; with a Di&s;pute con|cerning&mdash;</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Name of this Gentleman who had then re&s;ided &s;ome time at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e, was Mr. <HI>Square.</HI> His natural Parts were not of the fir&s;t Rate, but he had greatly improved them by a learn Education. He was deeply read in the An|tients, and a profe&s;t Ma&s;ter of all the Works of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> Upon which great Models he had prin|cipally form'd him&s;elf, &s;ometimes according with the Opinion of the one, and &s;ometimes with that of the other. In Morals he was a profe&s;t <HI>Platoni&s;t,</HI> and in Religion he inclined to be an <HI>Ari&s;totelian.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' he had, as we have &s;aid, formed his Mo|rals on the <HI>Platonic</HI> Model, yet he perfectly agreed with the Opinion of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in con&s;idering that great Man rather in the Quality of a Philo&s;opher or a Speculati&s;t, than as a Legi&s;lator. This Sentiment he carried a great way; indeed, &s;o far, as to regard all Virtue as Matter of Theory only. This, it is true, he never affirmed, as I have heard, to any one; and yet upon the lea&s;t attention to his Conduct, I can|not help thinking, it was his real Opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile &s;ome Contradictions which might otherwi&s;e appear in his Character.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="122">
This Gentleman and Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> &s;carce ever met without a Di&s;putation; for their Tenets were, indeed, diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other. <HI>Square</HI> held human Nature to be the Perfection of all Virtue, and that Vice was a Deviation from our Nature in the &s;ame Manner as Deformity of Body is. <HI>Thwackum,</HI> on the contrary, maintained that the human Mind, &s;ince the fall, was nothing but a Sink of Iniquity, till purified and redeemed by Grace. In one Point only they agreed, which was, in all their Di&s;cour&s;es on Morality never to mention the Word <HI>Goodne&s;s.</HI> The favourite Phra&s;e of the former, was <HI>the natural Beau|ty of Virtue;</HI> that of the latter, was the <HI>divine Power of Grace.</HI> The former mea&s;ured all Actions by the <HI>unalterable Rule of Right,</HI> and the <HI>eternal Fitne&s;s of Things;</HI> the latter decided all Matters by Authority; but, in doing this, he always u&s;ed the Scriptures and their Commentators, as the Lawyer doth his <HI>Coke upon Lyt|tleton,</HI> where the Comment is of equal Authority with the Text.</P>
<P>After this &s;hort Introduction, the Reader will be plea&s;ed to remember, that the Par&s;on had concluded his Speech with a triumphant Que&s;tion, to which he had apprehended no An&s;wer; <HI>viz.</HI> Can any Honour exi&s;t independent on Religion?</P>
<P>To this <HI>Square</HI> an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cour&s;e philo&s;ophically concerning Words, till their Meaning was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; that there were &s;carce any two Words of a more vague and incertain Signi|fication, than the two he had mentioned: For that there were almo&s;t as many different Opinions concern|ing Honour as concerning Religion. 'But, &s;ays he, if by Honour you mean the true natural Beauty of Vir|tue, I will maintain it may exi&s;t independent of any Religion whatever. Nay (added he) you your&s;elf will allow it may exi&s;t independent of all but one; &s;o will a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> and all the Maintainers of all the different Sects in the World.'</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="123">
<HI>Thwackum</HI> replied, This was arguing with the u&s;ual Malice of all the Enemies to the true Church. He &s;aid, he doubted not but that all the Infidels and Hereticks in the World would, if they could, con|fine Honour to their own ab&s;urd Errors, and dam|nable Deceptions; 'But Honour, &s;ays he, is not therefore manifold, becau&s;e there are many ab&s;urd Opinions about it; nor is Religion manifold, becau&s;e there are various Sects and Here&s;ies in the World. When I mention Religion, I mean the Chri&s;tian Religion; and not only the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, but the Prote&s;tant Religion; and not only the Prote&s;tant Religion, but the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And, when I mention Honour, I mean that Mode of divine Grace which is not only con&s;i&s;tent with, but dependent upon, this Religion; and is con&s;i&s;tent with, and dependent upon, no other. Now to &s;ay that the Honour I here mean, and which was, I thought, all the Honour I could be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, will uphold, much le&s;s dictate, an Untruth, is to a&s;&s;ert an Ab&s;urdity too &s;hocking to be conceived.'</P>
<P>'I purpo&s;ely avoided,' &s;ays <HI>Square,</HI> 'drawing a Con|clu&s;ion which I thought evident from what I have &s;aid; but if you perceived it, I am &s;ure you have not attempted to an&s;wer it. However, to drop the Article of Religion, I think it is plain, from what you have &s;aid, that we have different Ideas of Hon|our; or why do we not agree in the &s;ame Terms of its Explanation? I have a&s;&s;erted, that true Honour and true Virtue are almo&s;t &s;ynonimous Terms, and they are both founded on the unalter|able Rule of Right, and the eternal Fitne&s;s of Things; to which an Untruth being ab&s;olutely re|pugnant and contrary, it is certain that true Ho|nour cannot &s;upport an Untruth. In this, therefore, I think we are agreed; but that this Honour, can be &s;aid to be founded on Religion, to which it is an|tecedent, if by Religion be meant any po&s;itive Law&mdash;
<PB N="109" REF="124">
'I agree,' an&s;wered <HI>Thwackum,</HI> with great 'Warmth, 'with a Man who a&s;&s;erts Honour to be antecedent to Religion!&mdash;Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> did I a|gree&mdash;?</P>
<P>He was proceeding, when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> inter|po&s;ed, telling them very coldly, they had both mi&s;taken his Meaning; for that he had &s;aid nothing of true Honour.&mdash;It is po&s;&s;ible, however, he would not have ea&s;ily quieted the Di&s;putants, who were growing e|qually warm, had not another Matter now fallen out, which put a final End to the Conver&s;ation at pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing a nece&s;&s;ary Apology for the Author; and a childi&s;h Incident, which perhaps requires an Apology likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE I proceed farther, I &s;hall beg leave to obviate &s;ome Mi&s;con&s;tructions, into which the Zeal of &s;ome few Readers may lead them; for I would not willingly give Offence to any, e&s;pecially to Men who are warm in the Cau&s;e of Virtue or Re|ligion.</P>
<P>I hope, therefore, no Man will, by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mi&s;under&s;tanding, or Perver&s;ion, of my Meaning, mi&s;repre&s;ent me, as endeavouring to ca&s;t any Ridicule on the greate&s;t Perfections of Human Nature; and which do, indeed, alone purify and ennoble the Heart of Man, and rai&s;e him above the Brute Creation. This, Reader, I will venture to &s;ay, (and by how much the better Man you are your&s;elf, by &s;o much the more will you be inclined to believe me) that I would ra|ther have buried the Sentiments of the&s;e two Per&s;ons in eternal Oblivion, than have done any Injury to either of the&s;e glorious Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it is with a View to their Service that I have taken upon me to record the Lives and Actions of two of their fal&s;e and pretended Champions.
<PB N="110" REF="125">
A treacherous Friend is the mo&s;t dangerous Enemy; and I will &s;ay boldly, that both Religion and Virtue have received more real Di&s;credit from Hypocrites, than the wittie&s;t Profligates or Infidels could ever ca&s;t upon them: Nay farther, as the&s;e two, in their Purity, are rightly called the Bands of civil Society, and are indeed the greate&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings; &s;o when poi&s;oned and corrupted with Fraud, Pretence and Affection, they have become the wor&s;t of civil Cur&s;es, and have enabled Men to perpetrate the mo&s;t cruel Mi&s;chiefs to their own Species.</P>
<P>Indeed, I doubt not but this Ridicule will in gene|ral be allowed; my chief Apprehen&s;ions is, as many true and ju&s;t Sentiments often came from the Mouths of the&s;e Per&s;ons, le&s;t the whole &s;hould be taken to|gether, and I &s;hould be conceived to ridicule all alike. Now the Reader will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that as neither of the&s;e Men were Fools, they could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have holden none but wrong Principles, and to have uttered nothing but Ab&s;urdities; what Inju&s;tice, therefore, mu&s;t I have done to their Cha|racters, had I &s;elected only what was bad, and how horridly wretched and maimed mu&s;t their Arguments have appeared!</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is not Religion or Virtue, but the Want of them which is here expo&s;ed. Had not <HI>Thwackum</HI> too much neglected Virtue, and <HI>Square</HI> Religion, in the Compo&s;ition of their &s;everal Sy&s;tems; and had not both utterly di&s;carded all natural Goodne&s;s of Heart, they had never been repre&s;ented as the Ob|jects of Deri&s;ion in this Hi&s;tory; in which we will now proceed.</P>
<P>This Matter, then, which put an end to the Debate mentioned in the la&s;t Chapter, was no other than a Quarrel between Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> and <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> the Con&s;equence of which had been a Bloody No&s;e to the former; for though Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he was the younger, was in Size above the other's
<PB N="111" REF="126">
Match, yet <HI>Tom</HI> was much his Superior at the noble Art of Boxing.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> however, cautiou&s;ly avoided all Engagements with that Youth: For be&s;ides that <HI>Tommy Jones</HI> was an inoffen&s;ive Lad amid&s;t all his Roguery, and really loved <HI>Blifil;</HI> Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> being always the Se|cond of the latter, would have been &s;ufficient to deter him.</P>
<P>But well &s;ays a certain Author, No Man is wi&s;e at all Hours; it is therefore no Wonder that a Boy is not &s;o. A Difference ari&s;ing at Play between the two Lads, Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> called <HI>Tom</HI> a <HI>Beggarly Ba&s;tard.</HI> Upon which the lattter, who was &s;omewhat pa&s;&s;ionate in his Di&s;po&s;ition, immediately cau&s;ed that Phaenome|non in the Face of the former, which we have above remembered.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> now, with his Blood running from his No&s;e, and the Tears galloping after from his Eyes, appeared before his Uncle, and the tremendous <HI>Thwackum.</HI> In which Court an Indictment of A&s;|&s;ault, Batterry, and wounding, was in&s;tantly pre&s;er|red again&s;t <HI>Tom;</HI> who in his Excu&s;e only pleaded the Provocation, which was indeed all the Matter that Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> had omitted.</P>
<P>It is indeed po&s;&s;ible, that this Circum&s;tances might have e&s;caped his Memory; for, in his Reply, he po|&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted, that he made U&s;e of no &s;uch Appella|tion; adding, 'Heaven forbid &s;uch naughty Words &s;hould ever come out of his Mouth.'</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> though again&s;t all Form of Law, rejoined in Affirmance of the Words. Upon which Ma&s;ter <HI>Bli|fil</HI> &s;aid, 'It is no Wonder. Tho&s;e who will tell one Fib, will hardly &s;tick at another. If I had told my Ma&s;ter &s;uch a wicked Fib as you have done, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;hew my Face.'</P>
<P>'What Fib, Child,' cries <HI>Thwackum</HI> pretty ea|gerly?</P>
<P>'Why he told you that Nobody was with him a
<PB N="112" REF="127">
&s;hooting when he killed the Partridge; but he knows, (here he bur&s;t into a Flood of Tears) yes, he knows; for he confe&s;&s;ed it to me, that <HI>Black Jack</HI> the Game-keeper was there. Nay, he &s;aid,&mdash;Yes you did,&mdash;deny it if you can, That you would not have con|fe&s;t the Truth, though Ma&s;ter had cut you to Pieces.'</P>
<P>At this the Fire fla&s;hed from <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Eyes; and he cried out in Triumph: 'Oh ho! This is your mi&s;taken Notion of Honour! This is the Boy who was not to be whipped again!' But Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> with a more gentle A&s;pect, turned towards the Lad, and &s;aid, 'Is this true, Child? How came you to per&s;i&s;t &s;o ob&s;tinately in a Fal&s;hood?'</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> &s;aid, 'He &s;corned a Lie as much as any one; but he thought his Honour engaged him to act as he did; for he had promi&s;ed the poor Fellow to conceal him; which,' he &s;aid, 'he thought him|&s;elf farther obliged to, as the Game-keeper had begged him not to go into the Gentleman's Manor, and had at la&s;t gone him&s;elf in Compliance with his Per&s;ua&s;ions.' He &s;aid, this was the whole Truth of the Matter, and he would take his Oath of it; and concluded with very pa&s;&s;ionately begging Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'to have Compa&s;&s;ion on the poor Fellow's Family, e&s;pecially as he him&s;elf had been only guil|ty, and the other had been very difficultly prevailed on to what he did.' 'Indeed Sir,' &s;aid he, 'it could hardly be called a Lie that I told; for the poor Fellow was entirely innocent of the whole Matter. I &s;hould have gone alone after the Birds; nay, I did go at fir&s;t, and he only followed me to prevent more Mi&s;chief. Do, pray, Sir, let me be puni&s;hed, take my little Hor&s;e away again; but pray, Sir, forgive poor <HI>George.</HI>'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> he&s;itated a few Moments, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Boys, advi&s;ing them to live more friend|ly and peaceably together.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Opinion of the Divine and the Philo&s;opher con|cerning the two Boys; with &s;ome Rea&s;ons for their Opinions, and other Matters.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is probable, that by di&s;clo&s;ing this Secret, which had been communicated in the utmo&s;t Confidence to him, young <HI>Blifil</HI> pre&s;erved his Companion from a good La&s;hing: For the Offence of the bloody No&s;e would have been of it&s;elf &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for <HI>Thwack|um</HI> to have proceeded to Correction; but now this was totally ab&s;orbed, in the Con&s;ideration of the o|ther Matter; and with Regard to this, Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy</HI> declared privately, he thought the Boy de&s;erved Reward rather than Puni&s;hment; &s;o that <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Hand was withheld by a general Pardon.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum,</HI> who&s;e Meditations were full of Birch, exclaimed again&s;t this weak, and, as he &s;aid he would venture to call it, wicked Lenity. To remit the Puni&s;hment of &s;uch Crimes was, he &s;aid, to encou|rage them. He enlarged much on the Correcti|on of Children, and quoted many Texts from <HI>Solomon,</HI> and others; which being to be found in &s;o many other Books, &s;hall not be found here. He then applied him&s;elf to the Vice of Lying, on which Head he was altogether as learned as he had been on the o|ther.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> &s;aid, he had been endeavouring to reconcile the Behaviour of <HI>Tom</HI> with his Idea of perfect Virtue; but could not. He owned there was &s;omething which at fir&s;t Sight appeared like Fortitude in the Ac|tion, but as Fortitude was a Virtue, and Fal&s;hood a Vice, they could by no means agree or unite together. He added, that as this was in &s;ome mea&s;ure to confound Virtue and Vice, it might be worth Mr. <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Con&s;iderations, whether a larger Ca&s;tigation might not be laid on, upon that Account.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="129">
As both the&s;e learned Men concurred in cen&s;uring <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;o were they no le&s;s unanimous in applauding Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil.</HI> To bring Truth to light, was by the Par&s;on a&s;&s;erted to be the Duty of every religious Man; and by the Philo&s;opher this was declared to be highly conformable with the Rule of Right, and the eternal and unalterable Fitne&s;s of Things.</P>
<P>All this, however, weighed very little with Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He could not be prevailed on to &s;ign the Warrant for the Execution of <HI>Jones.</HI> There was &s;omething within his own Brea&s;t with which the in|vincible Fidelity which that Youth had pre&s;erved, corre&s;ponded much better than it had done with the Religion of <HI>Thwackum,</HI> or with the Virtue of <HI>Square.</HI> He therefore &s;trictly ordered the former of the&s;e Gen|tlemen to ab&s;tain from laying violent Hands on <HI>Tom</HI> for what had pa&s;t. The Pedagogue was obliged to obey tho&s;e Orders; but not without great Reluctance, and frequent Mutterings, that the Boy would be cer|tainly &s;poiled.</P>
<P>Towards the Game-keeper the good Man behaved with more Severity. He pre&s;ently &s;ummoned that poor Fellow before him, and after many bitter Re|mon&s;trances, paid him his Wages, and di&s;mi&s;t him from his Service; for Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> rightly ob&s;erved that there was great Difference between being guilty of a Fal&s;ehood to excu&s;e your&s;elf, and to excu&s;e a|nother. He likewi&s;e urged, as the principal Motive to his inflexible Severity again&s;t this Man, that he had ba&s;ely &s;uffered <HI>Tom Jones</HI> to undergo &s;o heavy a Puni&s;hment for his Sake, whereas he ought to have prevented it by making the Di&s;covery him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When this Story became public, many people differ|ed from <HI>Square</HI> and <HI>Thwackum,</HI> in judging the Conduct of the two Lads on the Occa&s;ion. Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> was generally called a &s;neaking Ra&s;cal, a poor-&s;pirited Wretch; with other Epithets of the like Kind; whil&s;t <HI>Tom</HI> was honoured with the Appellations of a
<PB N="115" REF="130">
brave Lad, a Jolly Dog, and an hone&s;t Fellow. In|deed his Behaviour to <HI>Black George</HI> much ingratiated him with all the Servants; for though that Fellow was before univer&s;ally di&s;liked, yet he was no &s;ooner turn|ed away than he was as univer&s;ally pitied; and the Friend&s;hip and Gallantry of <HI>Tom Jones</HI> was celebrated by them all with the highe&s;t Applau&s;e; and they con|demned Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> as openly as they dur&s;t, with|out incurring the Danger of offending his Mother. For all this, however, poor <HI>Tom</HI> &s;marted in the Fle&s;h; for though <HI>Thwackum</HI> had been inhibited to exerci&s;e his Arm on the foregoing Account; yet, as the Pro|verb &s;ays, <HI>It is ea&s;y to find a Stick,</HI> &amp;c. So was it ea&s;y to find a Rod; and, indeed, the not being able to find one was the only thing which could have kept <HI>Thwackum</HI> any long Time from cha&s;ti&s;ing poor <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>Had the bare Delight in the Sport been the only Inducement to the Pedagogue, it is probable, Ma&s;|ter <HI>Blifil</HI> would likewi&s;e have had his Share; but though Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had given him frequent Orders to make no Difference between the Lads, yet was <HI>Thwackum</HI> altogether as kind and gentle to this Youth, as he was har&s;h, nay even barbarous, to the other. To &s;ay the Truth, <HI>Blifil</HI> had greatly gained his Ma|&s;ter's Affections; partly by the profound Re&s;pect he always &s;hewed his Per&s;on, but much more by the decent Reverence with which he received his Doc|trine; for he had got by Heart, and frequently re|peated his Phra&s;es, and maintained all his Ma&s;ter's religious Principles with a Zeal which was &s;urpri&s;ing in one &s;o young, and which greatly endeared him to the worthy Preceptor.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Jones,</HI> on the other hand, was not only de|ficient in outward Tokens of Re&s;pect, often forget|ting to pull off his Hat, or to bow at his Ma&s;ter's Approach; but was altogether as unmindful both of his Ma&s;ter's Precepts and Example. He was indeed
<PB N="116" REF="131">
a thoughtle&s;s, giddy Youth, with little Sobriety in his Manners, and le&s;s in his Countenance; and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at his Companion for his &s;erious Behaviour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Square</HI> had the &s;ame Rea&s;on for his Preference of the former Lad; for <HI>Tom Jones</HI> &s;hewed no more Regard to the learned Di&s;cour&s;es which this Gentle|man would &s;ometimes throw away upon him, than to tho&s;e of <HI>Thwackum.</HI> He once ventured to make a Je&s;t of the Rule of Right; and at another Time &s;aid, He believed there was no Rule in the World capable of making &s;uch a Man as his Father, (for &s;o Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> &s;uffered him&s;elf to be called.)</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> on the contrary, had Addre&s;s enough at &s;ixteen to recommend him&s;elf at one and the &s;ame Time to both the&s;e Oppo&s;ites. With one he was all Religion, with the other he was all Virtue. And when both were pre&s;ent, he was profoundly &s;ilent, which both interpreted in his Favour and their own.</P>
<P>Nor was <HI>Blifil</HI> contented with flattering both the&s;e Gentlemen to their Faces; he took frequent Occa|&s;ions of prai&s;ing them behind their Backs to <HI>Allwor|thy;</HI> before whom, when they were alone together, and when his Uncle commended any religious or vir|tuous Sentiment (for many &s;uch came con&s;tantly from him) he &s;eldom failed to a&s;cribe it to the good In|&s;tructions he had received from either <HI>Thwackum</HI> or <HI>Square:</HI> For he knew his Uncle repeated all &s;uch Com|pliments to the Per&s;ons for who&s;e U&s;e they were meant; and he found by Experience the great Im|pre&s;&s;ions which they made on the Philo&s;opher, as well as on the Divine: For, to &s;ay the Truth, there is no kind of Flattery &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible as this, at &s;econd Hand.</P>
<P>The young Gentleman, moreover, &s;oon perceived how extremely grateful all tho&s;e Panegyricks on his In&s;tructors were to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf, as they &s;o loudly re&s;ounded the Prai&s;e of that &s;ingular Plan of
<PB N="117" REF="132">
Education which he had laid down: For this worthy Man having ob&s;erved the imperfect In&s;titution of our public Schools, and the many Vices which Boys were there liable to learn, had re&s;olved to educate his Ne|phew, as well as the other Lad, whom he had in a Manner adopted, in his own Hou&s;e; where he thought their Morals would e&s;cape all that Danger of being corrupted, to which they would be unavoidably ex|po&s;ed in any public School or Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Having therefore determined to commit the&s;e Boys to the Tuition of a private Tutor, Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> was recommended to him for that Office, by a very particular Friend, of who&s;e Under&s;tanding Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> had a great Opinion, and in who&s;e Integrity he placed much Confidence. This <HI>Thwackum</HI> was Fellow of a College, where he almo&s;t entirely re&s;id|ed; and had a great Ruputation for Learning, Re|ligion and Sobriety of Manners. And the&s;e were doubtle&s;s the Qualifications by which Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy'</HI>s Friend had been induced to recommend him; tho' indeed this Friend had &s;ome Obligations to <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Family, who were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons in a Borough which that Gentleman repre|&s;ented in Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum,</HI> at his fir&s;t Arrival, was extremely a|greeable to <HI>Allworthy;</HI> and indeed he perfectly an|&s;wered the Character which had been given of him. Upon longer Acquaintance, however, and more inti|mate Conver&s;ation, this worthy Man &s;aw Infirmities in the Tutor, which he could have wi&s;hed him to have been without; tho' as tho&s;e &s;eemed greatly over|ballanced by his good Qualities, they did not incline Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> to part with him; nor would they indeed have ju&s;tified &s;uch a Proceeding: For the Rea|der is greatly mi&s;taken, if he conceives that <HI>Thwack|um</HI> appeared to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> in the &s;ame Light as he doth to him in this Hi&s;tory; and he is as much de|ceived, if he imagines, that the mo&s;t intimate Ac|quaintenance
<PB N="118" REF="133">
which he him&s;elf could have had with that Divine, would have informed him of tho&s;e Things which we, from our In&s;piration, are enabled to open and di&s;cover. Of Readers who from &s;uch Conceits as the&s;e, condemn the Wi&s;dom or Penetration of Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that they make a very bad and ungrateful U&s;e of that Know|ledge which we have communicated to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e apparent Errors in the Doctrine of <HI>Thwack|um,</HI> &s;erved greatly to palliate the contrary Errors in that of <HI>Square,</HI> which our good Man no le&s;s &s;aw and condemned. He thought indeed that the diffe|rent Exuberancies of the&s;e Gentlemen, would correct their different Imperfections; and that from both, e&s;pecially with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the two Lads would derive &s;ufficient Precepts of true Religion and Virtue. If the Event happened contrary to his Expectations, this po&s;&s;ibly proceeded from &s;ome Fault in the Plan it&s;elf; which the Reader hath my Leave to di&s;cover, if he can. For we do not pretend to introduce any in|fallible Characters into this Hi&s;tory; where we hope nothing will be found which never hath yet been &s;een in human Nature.</P>
<P>To return therefore; the Reader will not, I think, wonder that the different Behaviour of the two Lads above commemorated, produced the different Effects, of which he hath already &s;een &s;ome In&s;tance; and be|&s;ides this, there was another Rea&s;on for the Conduct of the Philo&s;opher and the Pedagogue; but this being Matter of great Importance, we &s;hall reveal it in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing a better Rea&s;on &s;till for the before-mention|ed Opinions.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is to be known then, that tho&s;e two learned Per|&s;onages, who have lately made a con&s;iderable Fi|gure
<PB N="119" REF="134">
on the Theatre of this Hi&s;tory, had from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t Arrival at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e, taken &s;o great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n Affection, the one to his Virtue, the other to his Religion, that they had meditated the clo&s;e&s;t Alliance with him.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e they had ca&s;t their Eyes on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">air Widow, whom, tho' we have not for &s;ome Time made any mention of her, the Reader, we tru&s;t, hath not forgot. Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> was indeed the Object to which they both a&s;pired.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem remarkable that of four Per&s;ons whom we have commemorated at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hou&s;e; three of them &s;hould fix their Inclinations on a La|dy who was never greatly celebrated for her Beauty, and who was, moreover, now a little de&s;cended in|to the Vale of Years; but in reality, Bo&s;om Friends, and intimate Acquaintance, have a kind of natural Pro|pen&s;ity to particular Females at the Hou&s;e of a Friend; viz. to his Grand-mother, Mother, Si&s;ter, Daugh|ter, Aunt, Neice and Cou&s;in, when they are rich, and to his Wife, Si&s;ter, Daughter, Neice, Cou&s;in, Mi&s;tre&s;s or Servant Maid, if they &s;hould be hand|&s;ome.</P>
<P>We would not, however, have our Reader ima|gine, that Per&s;ons of &s;uch Characters as were &s;upport|ed by <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square,</HI> would undertake a Matter of this Kind, which hath been a little cen&s;ured by &s;ome rigid Morali&s;ts, before they had thoroughly examined it, and con&s;idered whether it was (as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> phra&s;es it) 'Stuff, o' th' Con&s;cience' or no. <HI>Thwackum</HI> was encouraged to the Undertaking, by reflecting, that to court your Neighbour's Si&s;ter is no where forbidden, and he knew it was a Rule in the Con&s;truction of all Laws, that <HI>"Expre&s;&s;um facit ce&s;&s;are Tacitum,"</HI> the Sen&s;e of which is, 'When a Law-giver &s;ets down plainly his whole Meaning, we are prevent|ed from making him mean what we plea&s;e our|&s;elves.' As &s;ome In&s;tances of Women, there|fore,
<PB N="120" REF="135">
are mentioned in the divine Law, which for|bids us to covet our Neighbours Goods, and that of a Si&s;ter omitted, he concluded it to be lawful. And as to <HI>Square,</HI> who was in his Per&s;on what is called a jolly Fellow, or a Widow's Man, he ea&s;ily recon|ciled his Choice to the eternal Fitne&s;s of Things.</P>
<P>Now, as both the&s;e Gentlemen were indu&s;trious in taking every Opportunity of recommending them|&s;elves to the Widow, they apprehended one certain Method was, by giving her Son the con&s;tant Prefe|rence to the other Lad; and as they conceived the Kindne&s;s and Affection which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;hewed the latter, mu&s;t be highly di&s;agreeable to her, they doubted not but the laying hold on all Occa&s;ions to degrade and villify him, would be highly plea&s;ing to her; who, as &s;he hated the Boy, mu&s;t love all tho&s;e who did him any hurt. In this <HI>Thwackum</HI> had the Advantage; for while <HI>Square</HI> could only &s;carify the poor Lad's Reputation, he could flea his Skin; and indeed he con&s;idered every La&s;h he gave him as a Compliment paid to his Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o that he could with the utmo&s;t Propriety repeat this old flogging Line, <HI>"Ca&s;tigo te non quod odio habeam, &s;ed quod</HI> AMEM; I cha&s;ti&s;e thee not out of Hatred, but out of Love." And this indeed he often had in his Mouth, or rather, according to the old Phra&s;e, never more properly applied, at his Fingers Ends.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on principally, the two Gentlemen concurred, as we have &s;een above, in their Opinion concerning the two Lads; this being indeed almo&s;t the only In&s;tance of their concurring on any Point: For be&s;ides the Difference of their Principles, they had both long ago &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected each others De|&s;ign, and hated one another with no little Degree of Inveteracy.</P>
<P>This mutual Animo&s;ity was a good deal increa&s;ed by their alternate Succe&s;&s;es: For Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> knew what they would be at long before they imagined it;
<PB N="121" REF="136">
or indeed intended &s;he &s;hould: For they proceeded with great Caution le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be offended, and ac|quaint Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> but they had no Rea&s;on for any &s;uch Fear. She was well enough plea&s;ed with a Pa&s;&s;ion of which &s;he intended none &s;hould have any Fruits but her&s;elf. And the only Fruits &s;he de&s;igned for her&s;elf were Flattery and Court&s;hip; for which Purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;oothed them by Turns, and a long Time equally. She was indeed rather inclined to favour the Par&s;on's Principles; but <HI>Square'</HI>s Per&s;on was more agreeable to her Eye; for he was a comely Man; whereas the Pedagogue did in Countenance very nearly re&s;emble that Gentleman, who in the Harlot's Progre&s;s is &s;een correcting the Ladies in <HI>Bridewel.</HI></P>
<P>Whether Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> had been &s;urfeited with the Sweets of Marriage, or di&s;gu&s;ted by its Bitters, or from what other Cau&s;e it proceeded, I will not de|termine; but &s;he could never be brought to li&s;ten to any &s;econd Propo&s;als. However, &s;he at la&s;t conver&s;|ed with <HI>Square,</HI> with &s;uch a Degree of Intimacy, that malicious Tongues began to whi&s;per Things of her, to which, as well for the Sake of the Lady, as that they were highly di&s;agreeable to the Rule of Right, and the Fitne&s;s of Things, we will give no Credit; and therefore &s;hall not blot our Paper with them. The Pedagogue, 'tis certain, whipt on without get|ting a Step nearer to his Journey's End.</P>
<P>Indeed he had committed a great Error, and that <HI>Square</HI> di&s;covered much &s;ooner than him&s;elf. Mrs. <HI>Blifl</HI> (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly gue&s;s'd) was not over and above plea&s;ed with the Be|haviour of her Hu&s;band; nay to be hone&s;t, &s;he ab&s;o|lutely hated him, till his Death at la&s;t a little reconciled him to her Affections. It will not be therefore great|ly wondered at, if &s;he had not the mo&s;t violent Re|gard to the Offspring &s;he had by him. And, in fact, he had &s;o little of this Regard, that in his Infancy &s;he
<PB N="122" REF="137">
&s;eldom &s;aw her Son, or took any Notice of him; and hence &s;he acquie&s;ced, after a little Reluctance, in all the Favours which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;howered on the Foundling; whom the good Man called his own Boy, and in all Things put on an intire Equality with Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil.</HI> This Acquie&s;cence in Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> was con&s;idered by the Neighbours, and by the Family, as a Mark of her Conde&s;cen&s;ion to her Brother's Hu|mour, and &s;he was imagined by all others, as well as <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square,</HI> to hate the Foundling in her Heart; nay, the more Civility &s;he &s;hewed him, the more they conceived &s;he dete&s;ted him, and the &s;urer Schemes &s;he was laying for his Ruin: For as they thought it her Intere&s;t to hate him, it was very diffi|cul for her to per&s;wade them &s;he did not.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> was the more confirmed in his Opinion, as &s;he had more than once cau&s;ed him to whip <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who was an Enemy to this Exerci&s;e, was abroad; whereas &s;he had never given any &s;uch Orders concerning young <HI>Blifil.</HI> And this had likewi&s;e impo&s;ed upon <HI>Square.</HI> In reality, though &s;he certainly hated her own Son; of which, however mon&s;trous it appears, I am a&s;&s;ured &s;he is not a &s;ingular In&s;tance, &s;he appeared, notwith&s;tand|ing all her outward Compliance, to be in her Heart &s;ufficiently di&s;plea&s;ed with all the Favour &s;hewn by Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> to the Foundling. She frequently com|plained of this behind her Brother's Back, and very &s;harply cen&s;ured him for it, both to <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square;</HI> nay, &s;he would throw it in the Teeth of <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf, when a little Quarrel or Miff, as it is vulgarly called, aro&s;e between them.</P>
<P>However, when <HI>Tom</HI> grew up, and gave Tokens of that Gallantry of Temper which greatly recom|mends Men to Women, this Di&s;inclination which &s;he had di&s;covered to him when a Child, by Degrees abated, and at la&s;t &s;he &s;o evidently demon&s;trated her Affection to him to be much &s;tronger than what &s;he
<PB N="123" REF="138">
bore her own Son, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take her any longer. She was &s;o de&s;irous of often &s;eeing him, and di&s;covered &s;uch Satisfaction and Delight in his Company, that before he was eighteen Years old, he was become a Rival to both <HI>Square</HI> and <HI>Thwackum;</HI> and what is wor&s;e, the whole Country began to talk as loudly of her Inclination to <HI>Tom,</HI> as they had be|fore done of that which &s;he had &s;hewn to <HI>Square;</HI> on which Account the Philo&s;opher conceived the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mplacable Hatred for our poor Hero.</P>

<P><HI>In which the Author him&s;elf makes his Appearance on the Stage.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THO' Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was not of him&s;elf ha&s;ty to &s;ee Things in a Di&s;advantageous Light, and was a Stranger to the public Voice, which &s;eldom reaches to a Brother or a Hu&s;band, tho' it rings in the Ears of all the Neighbourhood; yet was this Af|fection of Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> to <HI>Tom,</HI> and the Preference which &s;he too vi&s;ibly gave him to her own Son, of the utmo&s;t Di&s;advantage to that Youth.</P>
<P>For &s;uch was the Compa&s;&s;ion which inhabited Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Mind, that nothing but the Steel of Ju&s;|tice could ever &s;ubdue it. To be unfortunate in any Re&s;pect was &s;ufficient, if there was no Demerit to counterpoi&s;e it, to turn the Scale of that good Man's Pity, and to engage his Friend&s;hip, and his Benefac|tion.</P>
<P>When therefore he plainly &s;aw Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> was ab|&s;olutely dete&s;ted (for that he was) by his own Mother, he began, on that Account only, to look with an Eye of Compa&s;&s;ion upon him; and what the Effects of Compa&s;&s;ion are in good and benevolent Minds, I need not here explain to mo&s;t of my Readers.</P>
<P>Henceforward, he &s;aw every Appearance of Vir|tue in the Youth thro' the magnifying End, and view|ed
<PB N="124" REF="139">
all his Faults with the Gla&s;s inverted, &s;o that they became &s;carce perceptible. And this perhaps the a|miable Temper of Pity may make commendable; but the next Step the Weakne&s;s of human Nature a|lone mu&s;t excu&s;e: For he no &s;ooner perceived that Preference which Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> gave to <HI>Tom,</HI> than that poor Youth, (however innocent) began to &s;ink in his Affections as he ro&s;e in hers. This, it is true, would of it&s;elf alone never have been able to eradicate <HI>Jones</HI> from his Bo&s;om; but it was greatly injurious to him, and prepared Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Mind, for tho&s;e Im|pre&s;&s;ions, which afterwards produced the mighty E|vent, that will be contained hereafter in this Hi&s;tory; and to which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, the unfortunate Lad, by his own Wantonne&s;s, Wildne&s;s, and want of Caution, too much contributed.</P>
<P>In recording &s;ome In&s;tances of the&s;e, we &s;hall, if rightly under&s;tood, afford a very u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e well-di&s;po&s;ed Youths, who &s;hall hereafter be our Readers: For they may here find that Goodne&s;s of Heart, and Openne&s;s of Temper, tho' the&s;e may give them great Comfort within, and admini&s;ter to an hone&s;t Pride in their own Minds, will by no Means, alas! do their Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World. Prudence and Circum&s;pection are nece&s;&s;ary even to the be&s;t of Men. They are indeed as it were a Guard to Virtue, without which &s;he can never be &s;afe.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A childi&s;h Incident, in which, however, is &s;een a good natur'd Di&s;po&s;ition in</HI> Tom Jones.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader may remember, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> gave <HI>Tom Jones</HI> a little Hor&s;e, as a kind of &s;mart Money for the Puni&s;hment, which he imagined he had &s;uffered innocently.</P>
<P>This Hor&s;e <HI>Tom</HI> kept above half a Year, and then rode him to a neighbouring Fair, and &s;old him.</P>
<P>At his Return, being que&s;tioned by <HI>Thwackum,</HI> what he had done with the Money for which the Hor&s;e was &s;old, he frankly declared he would not tell him.</P>
<P>Oho! &s;ays <HI>Thwackum,</HI> you will not! then I will have it out of your Br&mdash;h; that being the Place to which he always applied for Information, on every doubtful Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> was now mounted on the Back of a Footman, and every Thing prepared for Execution, when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> entering the Room, gave the Criminal a Reprieve, and took him with him into another Apart|ment; where Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> being only pre&s;ent with <HI>Tom,</HI> he put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to him which <HI>Thwack|um</HI> had before a&s;ked him.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="141">
<HI>Tom</HI> an&s;wered, He could in Duty refu&s;e him no|thing; but as for that tyrannical Ra&s;cal, he would ne|ver make him any other An&s;wer than with a Cudgel, with which he hoped &s;oon to be able to pay him for all his Barbarities.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> very &s;everely reprimanded the Lad, for his indecent and di&s;re&s;pectful Expre&s;&s;ions concern|ing his Ma&s;ter; but much more for his avowing an Intention of Revenge. He threatened him with the entire Lo&s;s of his Favour, if he ever heard &s;uch ano|ther Word from his Mouth; for he &s;aid, he would never &s;upport or befriend a Reprobate. By the&s;e and the like Declarations, he extorted &s;ome Compunction from <HI>Tom,</HI> in which that Youth was not over &s;incere: For he really meditated &s;ome Return for all the &s;mart|ing Favours he had received at the Hands of the Peda|gogue. He was, however, brought by Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> to expre&s;s a Concern for his Re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Thwackum;</HI> and then the good Man, after &s;ome whole&s;ome Admonition, permitted him to proceed, which he did, as follows.</P>
<P>'Indeed, my dear Sir, I love and honour you more than all the World; I know the great Obligati|ons I have to you, and &s;hould dete&s;t my&s;elf, if I thought my Heart was capable of Ingratitude. Could the little Hor&s;e you gave me &s;peak, I am &s;ure he could tell you how fond I was of your Pre|&s;ent: For I had more Plea&s;ure in feeding him, than in riding him. Indeed, Sir, it went to my Heart to part with him; nor would I have &s;old him upon any other Account in the World than what I did. You your&s;elf, Sir, I am convinced in my Ca&s;e, would have done the &s;ame: For none ever &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt the Misfortunes of others. What would you feel, dear Sir, if you thought your&s;elf the Occa&s;ion of them?&mdash;Indeed, Sir, there was never any Mi&s;ery like theirs.&mdash;Like who&s;e, Child," &s;ays <HI>Allworthy,</HI> what do you mean? Oh, Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Tom,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="142">
your poor Game-keeper, with all his large Family, ever &s;ince your di&s;carding him, have been peri&s;hing with all the Mi&s;eries of Cold and Hunger. I could not bear to &s;ee the&s;e poor Wretches naked and &s;tarv|ing, and at the &s;ame Time know my&s;elf to have been the Occa&s;ion of all their Sufferings.&mdash;I could not bear it, Sir, upon my Soul, I could not." (here the Tears run down his Cheeks, and he thus proceeded) 'It was to &s;ave them from ab&s;olute De|&s;truction, I parted with your dear Pre&s;ent, notwith|&s;tanding all the Value I had for it.&mdash;I &s;old the Hor&s;e for them, and they have every Farthing of the Money.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> now &s;tood &s;ilent for &s;ome Moments, and before he &s;poke, the Tears &s;tarted from his Eyes. He at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Tom</HI> with a gentle Rebuke, ad|vi&s;ing him for the future to apply to him in Ca&s;es of Di&s;tre&s;s, rather than to u&s;e extraordinary Means of relieving them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Affair was afterwards the Subject of much Debate between <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square. Thwackum</HI> held, that this was flying in Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Face, who had intended to puni&s;h the Fellow for his Di&s;o+bedience. He &s;aid, in &s;ome In&s;tances, what the World called Charity appeared to him to be oppo&s;ing the Will of the Almighty, which had marked &s;ome particular Per&s;ons for De&s;truction; and that this was in like manner acting in Oppo&s;ition to Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> concluding, as u&s;ual, with a hearty Recommendation of Birch.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> argued &s;trongly, on the other Side, in Oppo|&s;ition perhaps to <HI>Thwackum,</HI> or in Compliance with Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who &s;eemed very much to approve what <HI>Jones</HI> had done. As to what he urged on this Oc|ca&s;ion, as I am convinced mo&s;t of my Readers will be much abler Advocates for poor <HI>Jones,</HI> it would be im|pertinent to relate it. Indeed it was not difficult to re|concile to the <HI>Rule of Right,</HI> an Action which it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to deduce from the <HI>Rule of Wrong.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing an Incident of a more heinous Kind, with the Comments of</HI> Thwackum <HI>and</HI> Square.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT hath been ob&s;erved by &s;ome Man of much grea|ter Reputation for Wi&s;dom than my&s;elf, that Mi&s;|fortunes &s;eldom come &s;ingle. An In&s;tance of this may, I believe, be &s;een in tho&s;e Gentlemen who have the Misfortune to have any of their Rogueries detect|ed: For here Di&s;covery &s;eldom &s;tops till the whole is come out. Thus it happened to poor <HI>Tom;</HI> who was no &s;ooner pardoned for &s;elling the Hor&s;e, than he was di&s;covered to have &s;ome time before &s;old a fine Bible which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> gave him, the Money ari&s;ing from which Sale he had di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame Manner. This Bible Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> had purcha&s;ed, though he had already &s;uch another of his own, partly out of re&s;pect for the Book, and partly out of Friend|&s;hip to <HI>Tom,</HI> being unwilling that the Bible &s;hould be &s;old out of the Family at half Price. He therefore depo&s;ited the &s;aid half Price him&s;elf; for he was a very prudent Lad, and &s;o careful of his Money, that he had laid up almo&s;t every Penny which he had re|ceived from Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P>Some People have been noted to be able to read in no Book but their own. On the contrary, from the Time when Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> was fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Bible, he never u&s;ed any other. Nay, he was &s;een reading in it much oftner than he had before been in his own. Now, as he frequently asked <HI>Thwackum</HI> to explain difficult Pa&s;&s;ages to him, that Gentleman unfortunately took Notice of <HI>Tom'</HI>s Name, which was written in many Parts of the Book. This brought on an Enquiry, which obliged Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> to di&s;co|ver the whole Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> was re&s;olved, a Crime of this Kind, which he called Sacrilege, &s;hould not go unpuni&s;hed.
<PB N="129" REF="144">
He therefore proceeded immediately to Ca&s;tigation; and not contented with that, he acquainted Mr. <HI>All|worthy,</HI> at their next Meeting, with this mon&s;trous Crime, as it appeared to him; inveighing again&s;t <HI>Tom</HI> in the mo&s;t bitter Terms, and likening him to the Buyers and Sellers who were driven out of the Temple.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> &s;aw this Matter in a very different Light. He &s;aid, He could not perceive any higher Crime in &s;elling one Book, than in &s;elling another. That to &s;ell Bibles was &s;trictly lawful by all Laws both di|vine and human, and con&s;equently there was no Un|fitne&s;s in it. He told <HI>Thwackum</HI> that his great Con|cern on this Occa&s;ion brought to his Mind the Story of a very devout Woman, who out of pure Regard to Religion, &s;tole <HI>Tillot&s;on'</HI>s Sermons from a Lady of her Acquaintance.</P>
<P>This Story cau&s;ed a va&s;t Quantity of Blood to ru&s;h into the Par&s;on's Face, which of it&s;elf was none of the pale&s;t; and he was going to reply with great Warmth and Anger, had not Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who was pre&s;ent at this Debate, interpo&s;ed. That Lady de|clared her&s;elf ab&s;olutely of Mr. <HI>Square'</HI>s Side. She argued, indeed, very learnedly in Support of his Opinion; and concluded with &s;aying, If <HI>Tom</HI> had been guilty of any Fault, &s;he mu&s;t confe&s;s her own Son appeared to be equally culpable; for that &s;he could &s;ee no Difference between the Buyer and the Seller; both of whom were alike to be driven out of the Temple.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> having declared her Opinion, put an End to the Debate. <HI>Square'</HI>s Triumph would almo&s;t have &s;topt his Words, had he needed them; and <HI>Thwackum,</HI> be&s;ides that, for Rea&s;ons before-men|tioned, he dur&s;t not venture at di&s;obliging the Lady, was almo&s;t choaked with Indignation. As to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> he &s;aid, Since the Boy had been already puni&s;hed, he would not deliver his Sentiments on the
<PB N="130" REF="145">
Occa&s;ion; and whether he was, or was not angry with the Lad, I mu&s;t leave to the Reader's own Conjecture.</P>
<P>Soon after this, an Action was brought again&s;t the Game-keeper by 'Squire <HI>We&s;tern</HI> (the Gentleman in who&s;e Manor the <HI>Partridge</HI> was killed) for De|predations of the like Kind. This was a mo&s;t unfor|tunate Circum&s;tance for the Fellow, as it not only of it&s;elf threatened his Ruin, but actually prevented Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> from re&s;toring him to his Favour: For as that Gentleman was walking out one Evening with Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> and young <HI>Jones,</HI> the latter &s;lily drew him to the Habitation of <HI>Black George;</HI> where the Family of that poor Wretch, namely, his Wife and Children, were found in all the Mi&s;ery with which Cold, Hunger, and Nakedne&s;s, can affect human Creatures: For as to the Money they had received from <HI>Jones,</HI> former Debts had con&s;umed almo&s;t the whole.</P>
<P>Such a Scene as this could not fail of affecting the Heart of Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He immediately gave the Mother a couple of Guineas, with which he bid her cloath her Children. The poor Woman bur&s;t into Tears at this Goodne&s;s, and while &s;he was thanking him, could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing her Gratitude to <HI>Tom;</HI> who had, &s;he &s;aid, long pre&s;erved both her and hers from &s;tarving. We have not, &s;ays &s;he, had a Mor&s;el to eat, nor have the&s;e poor Children had a Rag to put on, but what his Goodne&s;s hath be&s;towed on us: For indeed, be&s;ides the Hor&s;e and the Bible, <HI>Tom</HI> had &s;acrificed a Night-gown and other Things to the U&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Family.</P>
<P>On their Return home, <HI>Tom</HI> made u&s;e of all his Eloquence to di&s;play the Wretchedne&s;s of the&s;e Peo|ple, and the Penitence of <HI>Black George</HI> him&s;elf, and in this he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;aid He thought the Man had &s;uffered enough for what was pa&s;t; that he would forgive him, and think of &s;ome Means of providing for him and his Family.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was &s;o delighted with this News, that though
<PB N="131" REF="146">
it was dark when they returned home, he could not help going back a Mile in a Shower of Rain to ac|quaint the poor Woman with the glad Tidings; but, like other ha&s;ty Divulgers of News, he only brought on him&s;elf the Trouble of contradicting it: For the Ill-fortune of <HI>Black George</HI> made u&s;e of the very Opportunity of his Friend's Ab&s;ence to overturn all again.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In which Ma&s;ter</HI> Blifil <HI>and</HI> Jones <HI>appear in different Lights.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MASTER <HI>Blifil</HI> fell very &s;hort of his Compa|nion in the amiable Quality of Mercy; but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher Kind, namely, in Ju&s;tice: In which he followed both the Precepts and example of <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square;</HI> for though they would both make frequent U&s;e of the Word <HI>Mercy,</HI> yet it was plain, that in reality <HI>Square</HI> held it to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rule of Right; and <HI>Thwackum</HI> was for doing Ju&s;tice, and leaving Mer|cy to Heaven. The two Gentlemen did indeed &s;ome|what differ in Opinion concerning the Objects of this &s;ublime Virtue; by which <HI>Thwackum</HI> would probably have de&s;troyed one half of Mankind, and <HI>Square</HI> the other half.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> then, though he had kept Silence in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Jones,</HI> yet when he had better con|&s;idered the Matter, he could by no Means endure the Thought of &s;uffering his Uncle to confer Favours on the Unde&s;erving. He therefore re&s;olved im|mediately to acquaint him with the Fact which we have above &s;lightly hinted to the Readers. The Truth of which was as follows:</P>
<P>The Game-keeper, about a Year after he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Service, and before <HI>Tom'</HI>s &s;elling the Hor&s;e, being in Want of Bread, either to fill his own Mouth, or tho&s;e of his Family,
<PB N="132" REF="147">
as he pa&s;&s;ed through a Field belonging to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> e&s;pied a Hare &s;itting in her Form. This Hare he had ba&s;ely and barbarou&s;ly knocked on the Head, again&s;t the Laws of the Land, and no le&s;s again&s;t the Laws of Sport&s;men.</P>
<P>The Higler to whom the Hare was &s;old, being unfortunately taken many Months after with a Quan|tity of Game upon him, was obliged to make his Peace with the 'Squire by becoming Evidence again&s;t &s;ome Poacher. And now <HI>Black George</HI> was pitched upon by him as being a Per&s;on already obnoxious to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and one of no good Fame in the Coun|try. He was, be&s;ides, the be&s;t Sacrifice the Higler could make, as he had &s;upplied him with no Game &s;ince; and by this Means the Witne&s;s had an Oppor|tunity of &s;creening his better Cu&s;tomers: For the 'Squire, being charmed with the Power of Puni&s;hing <HI>Black George,</HI> whom a &s;ingle Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was &s;uffi|cient to ruin, made no further Enquiry.</P>
<P>Had this Fact been truly laid before Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> it might probably have done the Game-keeper very lit|tle Mi&s;chief. But there is no Zeal blinder than that which is in&s;pired with the Love of Ju&s;tice again&s;t Of|fenders. Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> had forgot the Di&s;tance of the Time. He varied likewi&s;e in the Manner of the Fact; and, by the ha&s;ty Addition of the &s;ingle Letter S, he con&s;iderably altered the Story; for he &s;aid that <HI>George</HI> had wired Hares. The&s;e Alterations might probably have been &s;et right, had not Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> unluckily in&s;i&s;ted on a Promi&s;e of Secrecy from Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> before he revealed the Matter to him; but by that Means, the poor Game-keeper was condemned, without having any Opportunity to defend him&s;elf: For as the Fact of killing the Hare, and of the Acti|on brought, were certainly true, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had no Doubt concerning the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Short-lived then was the Joy of the&s;e poor People; for Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> the next Morning declared he had
<PB N="133" REF="148">
fre&s;h Rea&s;on, without a&s;&s;igning it, for his Anger, and &s;trictly forbad <HI>Tom</HI> to mention <HI>George</HI> any more; though as for his Family, he &s;aid, he would endeavour to keep them from &s;tarving; but as to the Fellow him|&s;elf, he would leave him to the Laws, which nothing could keep him from breaking.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> could by no Means divine what had incen&s;ed Mr. <HI>Allworthy:</HI> For of Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> he had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion. However, as his Friend&s;hip was to be tired out by no Di&s;appointments, he now determined to try another Method of pre&s;erving the poor Game-keeper from Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was lately grown very intimate with Mr. <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> He had &s;o greatly recommended him&s;elf to that Gentleman, by leaping over five-barred Gates, and by other Acts of Sportman&s;hip, that the Squire had declared <HI>Tom</HI> would certainly make a great Man, if he had but &s;ufficient Encouragement. He often wi&s;hed he had him&s;elf a Son with &s;uch Parts; and one Day very &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted at a drinking Bout, that <HI>Tom</HI> &s;hould hunt a Pack of Hounds for a thou&s;and Pound of his Money with any Hunt&s;man in the whole County.</P>
<P>By &s;uch kind of Talents he had &s;o ingratiated him|&s;elf with the Squire, that he was a mo&s;t welcome Gue&s;t at his Table, and a favourite Companion in his Sport: Every Thing which the Squire held mo&s;t dear, to wit, his Guns, Dogs, and Hor&s;es, were now as much at the Command of <HI>Jones,</HI> as if they had been his own. He re&s;olved therefore to make u&s;e of this Favour on Behalf of his Friend <HI>Black George,</HI> whom he hoped to introduce into Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Family in the &s;ame Capacity in which he had before &s;erved Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader, if he con&s;iders that this Fellow was al|ready obnoxious to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and if he con&s;iders farther the weighty Bu&s;ine&s;s by which that Gentle|man's Di&s;plea&s;ure had been incurred, will perhaps
<PB N="134" REF="149">
condemn this as a fooli&s;h and de&s;perate Undertaking; but if he &s;hould not totally condemn young <HI>Jones</HI> on that Account, he will greatly applaud him for &s;trength|ening him&s;elf with all imaginable Intere&s;t on &s;o ardu|ous an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e then <HI>Tom</HI> applied to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Daughter, a young Lady of about &s;eventeen Years of Age, whom her Father, next after tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Implements of Sport ju&s;t before mentioned, loved and e&s;teemed above all the World. Now as &s;he had &s;ome Influence on the Squire, &s;o <HI>Tom</HI> had &s;ome In|fluence on her. But this being the intended Heroine of this Work, a Lady with whom we are our&s;elves great|ly in Love, and with whom many of our Rea|ders will probably be in Love too before we part, it is by no Means proper &s;he &s;hould make her Appear|ance at the End of a Book.</P>

<P>AS Truth di&s;tingui&s;hes our Writings from tho&s;e idle Romances which are filled with Mon&s;ters, the Productions, not of nature, but of di&s;tempered Brains; and which have been therefore recommended by an eminent Critic to the &s;ole U&s;e of the Pa&s;try-Cook: So, on the other hand, we would avoid any Re&s;emblance to that Kind of Hi&s;tory which a ce|lebrated Poet &s;eems to think is no le&s;s calculated for the Emolument of the Brewer, as the reading of it &s;hould be always attended with a Tankard of good Ale.</P>
<Q><L>While&mdash;Hi&s;tory with her Comrade Ale,</L>
<L>Sooths the &s;ad Series of her &s;erious Tale.</L></Q>
<P>For as this is the Liquor of modern Hi&s;torians, nay, perhaps their Mu&s;e, if we may believe the O|pinion of <HI>Butler,</HI> who attributes in&s;piration to Ale, it ought likewi&s;e to be the Potation of their Readers;
<PB N="136" REF="151">
&s;ince every Book ought to be read with the &s;ame Spirit, and in the &s;ame manner, as it is writ. Thus the famous Author of <HI>Hurlothrumbo</HI> told a learned Bi&s;hop, that the Rea&s;on his Lord&s;hip could not ta&s;te the Excellence of his Piece, was that he did not read it with a Fiddle in his Hand; which In&s;trument he him&s;elf always had in his own, when he compo|&s;ed it.</P>
<P>That our Work, therefore, might be in no Danger of being likened to the Labours of the&s;e Hi&s;torians, we have taken every Occa&s;ion of inter&s;per&s;ing through the whole &s;undry Similies, De&s;criptions, and other kind of poetical Embelli&s;hments. The&s;e are indeed, de&s;igned to &s;upply the Place of the &s;aid Ale, and to refre&s;h the Mind, whenever tho&s;e Slumbers which in a long Work are apt to invade the Reader as well the Writer, &s;hall begin to creep upon him. With|out Interruptions of this Kind, the be&s;t Narrative of plain Matter of Fact mu&s;t overpower every Reader; for nothing but the everla&s;ting Watchfulne&s;s, which <HI>Homer</HI> hath a&s;cribed to <HI>Jove</HI> him&s;elf, can be Proof again&s;t a News Paper of many Volumes.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave to the Reader to determine with what Judgment we have cho&s;en the &s;everal Occa&s;ions for in&s;erting the&s;e ornamental Parts of our Work. Surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper than the pre&s;ent; where we are about to in|troduce a con&s;iderable Character on the Scene; no le&s;s, indeed, than the Heroine of this Heroic, Hi|&s;torical, Pro&s;aic Poem. Here, therefore, we have thought proper to prepare the Mind of the Reader for her Reception, by filling it with every plea&s;ing Image, which we can draw from the Face of Nature. And for this Method we plead many Precedents. Fir&s;t, this is an Art well known to, and much practi&s;ed by, our Tragic Poets; who &s;eldom fail to prepare their Audience for the Reception of their principal Characters.</P>

Thus the Heroe is always introduced with a flou|ri&s;h of Drums and Trumpets, in order to rou&s;e a martial Spirit in the Audience, and to accommodate their Ears to Bomba&s;t and Fu&s;tian, which Mr. <HI>Lock'</HI>s blind Man would not have gro&s;sly erred in likening to the Sound of a Trumpet. Again, when Lovers are coming forth, &s;oft Mu&s;ic often conducts them on the Stage, either to &s;ooth the Audience with all the Softne&s;s of the tender Pa&s;&s;ion, or to lull or prepare them for that gentle Slumber in which they will mo&s;t probably be compo&s;ed by the en&s;uing Scene.</P>
<P>And not only the Poets, but the Ma&s;ters of the&s;e Poets, the Managers of Play-hou&s;es, &s;eem to be in this Secret; for, be&s;ides the afore&s;aid Kettle Drums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which denote the Heroe's Approach, he is ge|neraly u&s;hered on the Stage by a large Troop of half a dozen Scene-&s;hifters; and how nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e are imagined to his Appearance, may be concluded from the following Theatrical Story.</P>
<P>King <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> was at Dinner at an Ale-hou&s;e bor|dering on the Theatre, when he was &s;ummoned to go on the Stage. The Heroe, being unwilling to quit his Shoulder of Mutton, and as unwilling to draw on him&s;elf the Indignation of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> (his Brother Manager) for making the Audience wait, had bribed the&s;e his Harbingers to be out of the Way. While Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> therefore, was thundering out, <Q>'Where are the Carpenters to walk on before King <HI>Pyrrhus,'</HI></Q> that Monarch very quietly eat his Mutton, and the Audience, however impatient, were obliged to en|tertain them&s;elves with Mu&s;ic in his Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>To be plain, I much que&s;tion whether the Politi|cian, who hath generally a good No&s;e, hath not &s;cented out &s;omewhat of the Utility of this Practice. I am convinced that awful Magi&s;trate my Lord May|or contracts a good deal of that Reverence which at|tends him through the Year, by the &s;everal Pageants who precede his Pomp. Nay, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that
<PB N="138" REF="153">
even I my&s;elf, who am not remarkably liable to be captivated with Show, have yielded not a little to the Impre&s;&s;ions of much preceding State. When I have &s;een a Man &s;trutting in a Proce&s;&s;ion, after others who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s hath been only to walk before him, I have conceived a higher Notion of his Dignity, than I have felt on &s;eeing him in a common Situation. But there is one In&s;tance which comes exactly up to my Purpo&s;e. This is the Cu&s;tom of &s;ending on a Ba&s;|ket-woman, who is to precede the Pomp at a Coro|nation, and to &s;trew the Stage with Flowers, before the great Per&s;onages begin their Proce&s;&s;ion. The Antients would certainly have invoked the Godde&s;s <HI>Flora</HI> for this Purpo&s;e, and it would have been no Dif|ficulty for their Prie&s;ts or Politicians to have per&s;uad|ed the People of the real Pre&s;ence of the Deity, though a plain Mortal had per&s;onated her, and per|formed her Office. But we have no &s;uch De&s;ign of impo&s;ing on our Reader, and therefore tho&s;e who ob|ject to the Heathen Theology, may, if they plea&s;e, change our Godde&s;s into the above-mentioned Bas|ket-woman. Our Intention, in &s;hort, is to intro|duce our Heroine with the utmo&s;t Solemnity in our Power, with an Elevation of Stile, and all other Cir|cum&s;tances proper to rai&s;e the Veneration of our Rea|der. Indeed we would, for certain Cau&s;es, advi&s;e tho&s;e of our Male Readers who have any Hearts, to read no farther, were we not well a&s;&s;ured, that how amiable &s;oever the Picture of our Heroine will appear, as it is really a Copy from Nature, many of our fair Country-women will be found worthy to &s;atisfy any Pa&s;&s;ion, and to an&s;wer any Idea of Female Perfecti|on, which our Pencil will be able to rai&s;e.</P>

From Love proceeds your Mu&s;ic, and to Love it returns. Awak|en therefore that gentle Pa&s;&s;ion in every Swain: for lo! adorned with all the Charms in which Na|ture can array her; bedecked with Beauty, Youth, Sprightline&s;s, Innocence, Mode&s;ty, and Tenderne&s;s, breathing Sweetne&s;s from her ro&s;y Lips, and darting Brightne&s;s from her &s;parkling Eyes, the lovely <HI>Sophia</HI> comes.</P>

No. If thou ha&s;t &s;een all the&s;e without knowing what Beauty is, thou ha&s;t no Eyes; if without feeling its Power, thou ha&s;t no Heart.</P>
<P>Yet is it po&s;&s;ible, my Friend, that thou maye&s;t have &s;een all the&s;e without being able to form an ex|act Idea of <HI>Sophia:</HI> for &s;he did not exactly re&s;emble any of them. She was mo&s;t like the Picture of La|dy <HI>Renelagh;</HI> and I have heard more &s;till to the fa|mous Dutche&s;s of <HI>Mazarine:</HI> but mo&s;t of all, &s;he re&s;embled one who&s;e Image never can depart from my Brea&s;t, and whom, if thou do&s;t remember, thou ha&s;t then, my Friend, an adequate Idea of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>But le&s;t this &s;hould not have been thy Fortune, we will endeavour with our utmo&s;t Skill to de&s;cribe this Paragon, though we are &s;en&s;ible that our highe&s;t Abi|lities are very inadequate to the Ta&s;k.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then, the only Daughter of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> was a middle-&s;ized Woman; but rather inclining to tall. Her Shape was not only exact, but extreme|ly delicate; and the nice Proportion of her Arms promi&s;ed the true&s;t Symmetry in her Limbs. Her Hair, which was black, was &s;o luxuriant, that it reached her Middle, before &s;he cut it, to comply with the modern Fa&s;hion; and it was now curled &s;o grace|fully in her Neck, that few would believe it to be her own. If Envy could find any Part of her Face which demanded le&s;s Commendation than the re&s;t, it might po&s;&s;ibly think her Forehead might have been higher without Prejudice to her. Her Eye-brows were full, even, and arched beyond the Power of Art to imi|tate. Her black Eyes had a Lu&s;tre in them, which all her Softne&s;s could not extingui&s;h. Her No&s;e was
<PB N="141" REF="156">
exactly regular, and her Mouth, in which were two Rows of Ivory, exactly an&s;wered Sir <HI>John Suckling'</HI>s De&s;cription in tho&s;e Lines.</P>
<Q><L>Her Lips were red, and one was thin,</L>
<L>Compar'd to that was next her Chin.</L>
<L>Some Bee had &s;tung it newly.</L></Q>
<P>Her Cheeks, were of the oval Kind; and in her right &s;he had a Dimple which the lea&s;t Smile di&s;cover|ed. Her Chin had certainly its Share in forming the Beauty of her Face; but it was difficult to &s;ay it was either large or &s;mall, tho' perhaps it was rather of the former kind. Her Complexion had rather more of the Lilly than of the Ro&s;e; but when Exerci&s;e, or Mode&s;ty, encrea&s;ed her natural Colour, no Vermilion could equal it. Then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated Dr. <HI>Donne.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Her pure and eloquent Blood</L>
<L>Spoke in her Cheeks, and &s;o di&s;tinctly wrought,</L>
<L>That one might almo&s;t &s;ay her Body thought.</L></Q>
<P>Her Neck was long and finely turned; and here, if I was not afraid of offending her Delicacy, I might ju&s;tly &s;ay, the highe&s;t Beauties of the famous <HI>Venus de Medicis</HI> were outdone. Here was Whitene&s;s which no Lillies, Ivory, nor Alaba&s;ter could match. The fine&s;t Cambric might indeed be &s;uppo&s;ed from Envy to cover that Bo&s;om, which was much whiter than it&s;elf,&mdash;It was indeed,</P>
<Q>Nitor &s;plendens Pario marmore purius.</Q>
<P>"A Glo&s;s &s;hining beyond the pure&s;t Brightne&s;s of <HI>Parian</HI> Marble."</P>
<P>Such was the Out&s;ide of <HI>Sophia;</HI> nor was this beau|tiful Frame di&s;graced by an Inhabitant unworthy of it. Her Mind was every way equal to her Per&s;on; nay, the latter borrowed &s;ome Charms from the former: For when &s;he &s;miled, the Sweetne&s;s of her Temper diffu&s;ed that Glory over her Countenance, which no Regularity of Features can give. But as there are no Perfections of the Mind which do not di&s;cover them|&s;elves,

<P>It may however, be proper to &s;ay, that whatever mental Accompli&s;hments &s;he had derived from Na|ture, they were &s;omewhat improved and cultivated by Art: for &s;he had been educated under the Care of an Aunt, who was a Lady of great Di&s;cretion, and was thoroughly acquainted with the World, having lived in her Youth about the Court, whence &s;he had retir|ed &s;ome Years &s;ince into the Country.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Wherein the Hi&s;tory goes back to commemorate a tri|fling Incident that happened &s;ome Years &s;ince; but which, trifling as it was, had &s;ome future Con&s;e|quences.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE amiable <HI>Sophia</HI> was now in her eighteenth Year, when &s;he is introduced into this Hi&s;tory. Her Father, as hath been &s;aid, was fonder of her than of any other human Creature. To her, there|fore, <HI>Tom Jones</HI> applied, in order to engage her In|tere&s;t
<PB N="143" REF="158">
on the Behalf of his Friend the Game-keeper.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to this Bu&s;ine&s;s, a &s;hort Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">apitulation of &s;ome previous Matters may be nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>Though the different Tempers of Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> did not admit of a very intimate Corre&s;pondence, yet they lived upon what is called a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ecent Footing together; by which Means the young People of both Families had been acquainted from their Infancy; and as they were all near of the &s;ame Age, had been frequent Play-mates together.</P>
<P>The Gaiety of <HI>Tom'</HI>s Temper &s;uited better with <HI>Sophia,</HI> than the grave and &s;ober Di&s;po&s;ition of Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil.</HI> And the Preference which &s;he gave the for|mer of the&s;e, would often appear &s;o plainly, that a Lad of a more pa&s;&s;ionate Turn than Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> was, might have &s;hewn &s;ome Di&s;plea&s;ure at it.</P>
<P>As he did not, however, outwardly expre&s;s any &s;uch Di&s;gu&s;t, it would be an ill Office in us to pay a Vi&s;it to the inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of his Mind, as &s;ome &s;candalous People &s;earch into the mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs of their Friends, and often pry into their Clo&s;ets and Cupboards, only to di&s;cover their Poverty and Mean|ne&s;s to the World.</P>
<P>However, as Per&s;ons who &s;u&s;pect they have given others Cau&s;e of Offence, are apt to conclude they are offended; &s;o <HI>Sophia</HI> imputed an Action of Ma&s;ter <HI>Bli|fil,</HI> to his Anger, which the &s;uperior Sagacity of <HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square</HI> di&s;cerned to have ari&s;en from a much better Principle.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Jones,</HI> when very young, had pre&s;ented <HI>So|phia</HI> with a little Bird, which he had taken from the Ne&s;t, had nur&s;ed up, and taught to &s;ing.</P>
<P>Of this Bird, <HI>Sophia,</HI> then about thirteen Years old, was &s;o extremely fond, that her chief Bu&s;ine&s;s was to feed and tend it, and her chief Plea&s;ure to play with it. By the&s;e Means little <HI>Tommy,</HI> for &s;o the Bird was called, was become &s;o tame, that it would
<PB N="144" REF="159">
feed out of the Hand of its Mi&s;tre&s;s, would perch up on her Finger, and lie contented in her Bo&s;om, where it &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of its own Happine&s;s; tho &s;he always kept a &s;mall String about its Leg, no would ever tru&s;t it with the Liberty of flying away.</P>
<P>One Day, when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and his whole Fa+mily, dined at Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s, Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> being in the Garden with little <HI>Sophia,</HI> and ob&s;erving the ex+treme Fondne&s;s that &s;he &s;hewed for her little Bird, de+&s;ired her to tru&s;t it for a Moment in his Hands. <HI>So|phia</HI> pre&s;ently complied with the young Gentleman's Reque&s;t, and after &s;ome previous Caution, delivered him her Bird; of which he was no &s;ooner in Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, than he &s;lipt the String from its Leg, and to&s;&s;ed it into the Air.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h Animal no &s;ooner perceived it&s;elf at Liberty, than forgetting all the Favours it had receiv|ed from <HI>Sophia,</HI> it flew directly from her, and perch|ed on a Bough at &s;ome Di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;eeing her Bird gone, &s;ereamed out &s;o loud, that <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> who was at a little Di&s;tance, imme|diately ran to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner informed of what had happened, than he cur&s;ed <HI>Blifil</HI> for a pitiful, malicious Ra&s;cal, and then immediately &s;tripping off his Coat, he ap|plied him&s;elf to climbing the Tree to which the Bird e&s;caped.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> had almo&s;t recovered his little Name-&s;ake, when the Branch on which it was perched, and that hung over a Canal, broke, and the poor Lad plump|ed over Head and Ears into the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia'</HI>s Concern now changed its Object. And as &s;he apprehended the Boy's Life was in Danger, &s;he &s;creamed ten times louder than before; and in|deed Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> him&s;elf now &s;econded her with all the Vociferation in his Power.</P>
<P>The company who were &s;itting in a Room next the Garden, were in&s;tantly alarmed, and came all
<PB N="145" REF="160">
forth; but ju&s;t as they reached the Canal, <HI>Tom,</HI> (for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Water was luckily pretty &s;hallow in that Part) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rrived &s;afely on &s;hore.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> fell violently on poor <HI>Tom,</HI> who &s;tood dropping and &s;hivering before him, when Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> de&s;ired him to have Patience, and turning to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> &s;aid, Pray, Child, what is the Rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f all this Di&s;turbance?</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> an&s;wered, 'Indeed, Uncle, I am ve|ry &s;orry for what I have done; I have been unhap|pily the Occa&s;ion of it all. I had Mi&s;s <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Bird in my Hand, and thinking the poor Creature lan|gui&s;hed for Liberty, I own, I could not forbear giving it what it de&s;ired: for I always thought there was &s;omething very cruel in confining any Thing. It &s;eemed to me again&s;t the Law of Nature, by which every Thing hath a right to Liberty; nay, it is even unchri&s;tian; for it is not doing what we would be done by: But if I had imagined Mi&s;s <HI>So|phia</HI> would have been &s;o much concerned at it, I am &s;ure I would never have done it; nay, if I had known what would have happened to the Bird it&s;elf; for when Ma&s;ter <HI>Jones,</HI> who climbed up the Tree after it, fell into the Water, the Bird took a &s;econd Flight, and pre&s;ently a na&s;ty Hawk carried it away. Poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> who now fir&s;t heard of her little <HI>Tommy'</HI>s Fate; for her Concern for <HI>Jones</HI> had pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ented her perceiving it when it happened, &s;hed a Shower of Tears.

Her Fa|ther chid her for crying &s;o for a fooli&s;h Bird; but could not help telling young <HI>Blifil,</HI> if he was a Son of his, his Back&s;ide &s;hould be well flea'd.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> now returned to her Chamber, the two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oung Gentlemen were &s;ent home, and the re&s;t of the Company returned to their Bottle; where a Conver|&s;ation

<P>The Lawyer, with great Gravity, delivered him|&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P>'If the Ca&s;e be put of a Partridge, there can be no Doubt but an Action would lie: For though this be <HI>ferae Naturae,</HI> yet being reclaimed, Property ve&s;ts; but being the Ca&s;e of a Singing Bird, though re|claimed, as it is a Thing of ba&s;e Nature, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as <HI>nullius in Bonis.</HI> In this Ca&s;e, there|fore, I conceive the Plaintiff mu&s;t be non&s;uited; and I &s;hould di&s;advi&s;e the bringing any &s;uch Action.'</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing Matter accommodated to every Ta&s;te.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PARVA leves capiunt Animos,</HI> 'Small Things affect light Minds,' was the Sentiment of a great Ma&s;ter of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love. And certain it is, that from this Day <HI>Sophia</HI> began to have &s;ome little Kindne&s;s for <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> and no little Aver&s;ion for his Companion.</P>
<P>Many Accidents from time to time improved both the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions in her Brea&s;t; which, without our re|counting, the Reader may well conclude, from what we have before hinted of the different Tempers of the&s;e Lads, and how much the one &s;uited with her own Inclinations more than the other. To &s;ay the Truth, <HI>Sophia,</HI> when very young, di&s;cerned that <HI>Tom,</HI> though an idle, thoughtle&s;s, rattling Ra&s;cal, was no|body's Enemy but his own; and that Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> though a prudent, di&s;creet, &s;ober young Gentleman, was at the &s;ame Time &s;trongly attached to the In|tere&s;t only of one &s;ingle Per&s;on; and who that &s;in|gle Per&s;on was, the Reader will be able to divine without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance of ours.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Characters are not always received in the World with the different Regard which &s;eems &s;e|verally due to either; and which one would imagine Mankind, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;hould &s;hew towards them. But perhaps there may be a political Rea&s;on for it: In finding one of a truly benevolent Di&s;po&s;iti|on, Men may very rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, they have found a Trea&s;ure, and be de&s;irous of keeping it, like all other good Things, to them&s;elves. Hence they may imagine, that to trumpet forth the Prai&s;es of &s;uch a Per&s;on, would, in the vulgar Phra&s;e, be crying <HI>Roa&s;t|meat;</HI> and calling in Partakers of what they intend to apply &s;olely to their own U&s;e. If this Rea&s;on doth not &s;atisfy the Reader, I know no other Means of ac|counting
<PB N="151" REF="166">
for the little Re&s;pect which I have commonly &s;een paid to a Character which really doth great Ho|nour to Human Nature, and is productive of the high|e&s;t Good to Society. But it was otherwi&s;e with <HI>Sophia.</HI> She honoured <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> and &s;corned Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;he knew the Meaning of tho&s;e two Words.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had been ab&s;ent upwards of three Years with her Aunt; during all which Time &s;he had &s;el|dom &s;een either of the&s;e young Gentlemen. She dined, however, once together with her Aunt, at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s. This was a few Days after the Adven|ture of the Partridge, before commemorated. <HI>Sophia</HI> heard the whole Story at Table, where &s;he &s;aid no|thing; nor indeed could her Aunt get many Words from her, as &s;he returned home; but her Maid, when undre&s;&s;ing her, happening to &s;ay, 'Well, Mi&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;een young Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> to Day.' She an&s;wered with much Pa&s;&s;ion, 'I hate the Name of Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> as I do whatever is ba&s;e and trea|cherous; and I wonder Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> would &s;uffer that old barbarous Schoolma&s;ter to puni&s;h a poor Boy &s;o cruelly for what was only the Effect of his Good-nature.' She then recounted the Story to her Maid, and concluded with Saying&mdash;'Don't you think he is a Boy of a noble Spirit?'</P>
<P>This young Lady was now returned to her Father; who gave her the Command of his Hou&s;e, and placed her at the upper End of his Table, where <HI>Tom</HI> (who from his great Love of Hunting was become a great Favourite of the Squire) often dined. Young Men of open, generous Di&s;po&s;itions are naturally inclined to Gallantry, which, if they have good under&s;tand|ings, as was in reality <HI>Tom'</HI>s Ca&s;e, exerts it&s;elf in an obliging, complai&s;ant Behaviour to all Women in ge|neral. This greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>Tom</HI> from the boi&s;terous Brutality of mere Country Squires on the one hand; and from the &s;olemn, and &s;omewhat ful|len,
<PB N="152" REF="167">
Deportment of Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil</HI> on the other: And he began now, at Nineteen, to have the Name of a pretty Fellow among all the Women in the Neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> behaved to <HI>Sophia</HI> with no Particularity, un|le&s;s, perhaps, by &s;hewing her a higher Re&s;pect than he paid to any other. This Di&s;tinction her Beauty, Fortune, Sen&s;e, and amiable Carriage, &s;eemed to de|mand; but as to De&s;ign upon her Per&s;on he had none; for which we &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;uffer the Reader to condemn him of Stupidity; but perhaps we &s;hall be able indifferently well to account for it hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> with the highe&s;t Degree of Innocence and Mode&s;ty, had a remarkable Sprightline&s;s in her Tem|per. This was &s;o greatly encrea&s;ed whenever &s;he was in Company with <HI>Tom,</HI> that, had he not been very young and thoughtle&s;s, he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved it; or had not Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Thoughts been gene|rally either in the Field, the Stable, or the Dog-kennel, it might have, perhaps, created &s;ome Jealou&s;y in him; but &s;o far was the good Gentleman from entertain|ing any &s;uch Su&s;picions, that he gave <HI>Tom</HI> every Op|portunity with his Daughter which any Lover could have wi&s;hed. And the&s;e <HI>Tom</HI> innocently improved to better Advantage, by following only the Dictates of his natural Gallantry and good-nature, than he might, perhaps, have done, had he had the deepe&s;t De&s;igns on the young Lady.</P>
<P>But, indeed, it can occa&s;ion little Wonder that this Matter e&s;caped the Ob&s;ervation of others, &s;ince poor <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf never remarked it, and her Heart was irretrivably lo&s;t before &s;he &s;u&s;pected it was in Danger.</P>
<P>Matters were in this Situation, when <HI>Tom</HI> one Af|ternoon finding <HI>Sophia</HI> alone, began, after a &s;hort Apology, with a very &s;erious Face, to acquaint her, that he had a Favour to a&s;k of her, which he hoped her Goodne&s;s would comply with.</P>
<P>Though neither the young Man's Behaviour, nor
<PB N="153" REF="168">
indeed his Manner of opening this Bu&s;ine&s;s, were &s;uch as could give her any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of &s;u&s;pecting he intended to make Love to her; yet, whether Nature whi&s;pered &s;omething into her Ear, or from what Cau&s;e it aro&s;e I will not determine, certain it is, &s;ome Idea of that Kind mu&s;t have intruded it&s;elf; for her Colour for&s;ook her Cheeks, her Limbs trembled, and her Tongue would have faultered, had <HI>Tom</HI> &s;topped for an An&s;wer: But he &s;oon relieved her from her Per|plexity, by proceeding to inform her of his Reque&s;t, which was to &s;ollicit her Intere&s;t on Behalf of the Game-keeper, who&s;e own Ruin, and that of a large Family, mu&s;t be, he &s;aid, the Con&s;equence of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s pur&s;uing his Action again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> pre&s;ently recovered her Confu&s;ion, and with a Smile full of Sweetne&s;s, &s;aid, 'Is this the mighty Favour you a&s;ked with &s;o much Gravity. I will do it with all my Heart. I really pity the poor Fel|low, and no longer ago than Ye&s;terday &s;ent a &s;mall Matter to his Wife.' This &s;mall Matter was one of her Gowns, &s;ome Linnen, and ten Shillings in Money, of which <HI>Tom</HI> had heard, and it had, in reality, put this Solicitation into his Head.</P>
<P>Our Youth, now emboldened with his Succe&s;s, re|&s;olved to pu&s;h the Matter farther; and ventured even to beg her Recommendation of him to her Father's Service; prote&s;ting that he thought him one of the hone&s;te&s;t Fellows in the Country, and extremely well qualified for the Place of a Game-keeper, which luckily then happened to be vacant.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> an&s;wered; 'Well, I will undertake this too; but I cannot promi&s;e you as much Succe&s;s as in the former Part, which I a&s;&s;ure you I will not quit my Father without obtaining. However, I will do what I can for the poor Fellow, for I &s;incerely look upon him and his Family as Objects of great Compa&s;&s;ion.'&mdash;'And now, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I mu&s;t a&s;k' you a Favour.&mdash;'</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="169">
'A Favour, Madam, (cries <HI>Tom)</HI> if you knew the Plea&s;ure you have given me in the Hopes of receiv|ing a Command from you, you would think by mentioning it you mu&s;t confer the greate&s;t Favour on me; for by this dear Hand I would &s;acrifice my  Life to oblige you.'</P>
<P>He then &s;natched her Hand, and eagerly ki&s;&s;ed it, which was the fir&s;t Time his Lips had ever touched her. The Blood, which before had for&s;aken her Cheeks, now made her &s;ufficient Amends, by ru&s;h|ing all over her Face and Neck with &s;uch Violence, that they became all of a &s;carlet Colour. She now fir&s;t felt a Sen&s;ation to which &s;he had been before a Stranger, and which, when &s;he had Lei&s;ure to reflect on it, began to acquaint her with &s;ome Secrets, which the Reader, if he doth not already gue&s;s them, will know in due Time.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he could &s;peak (which was not in&s;tantly) informed him, that the Favour &s;he had to de|&s;ire of him, was not to lead her Father through &s;o many Dangers in Hunting; for that, from what &s;he had heard, &s;he was terribly frightened every Time they went out together, and expected &s;ome Day or other to &s;ee her Father brought Home with broken Limbs. She therefore begged him, for her Sake, to be more cautious; and, as he well knew Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> would follow him, not to ride &s;o madly, nor to take tho&s;e dangerous Leaps for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> faithfully promi&s;ed to obey her Commands; and after thanking her for her kind Compliance with his Reque&s;t, took his Leave, and departed highly charmed with his Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Sophia</HI> was charmed too; but in a very dif|ferent Way. Her Sen&s;ations, however, the Rea|der's Heart, (if he or &s;he have any) will better repre|&s;ent than I can, if I had as many Mouths as ever Poet wi&s;hed for, to eat, I &s;uppo&s;e, tho&s;e many Dain|ties with which he was &s;o plentifully provided.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="170">
It was Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Cu&s;tom every Afternoon, as &s;oon as he was drunk, to hear his Daughter play on the Harp&s;ichord: for he was a great Lover of Mu&s;ic, and perhaps, had he lived in Town, might have pa&s;|&s;ed for a Connoi&s;&s;eur: for he always excepted a|gain&s;t the fine&s;t Compo&s;itions of Mr. <HI>Handel.</HI> He never reli&s;hed any Mu&s;ic but what was light and airy; and indeed his mo&s;t favourite Tunes, were <HI>Old Sir</HI> Simon <HI>the King, St.</HI> George, <HI>he was for</HI> England, <HI>Bobbing</HI> Joan, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>His Daughter tho' &s;he was a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of Mu&s;ic, and would never willingly have played any but <HI>Handel'</HI>s, was &s;o devoted to her Father's Plea&s;ure, that &s;he learnt all tho&s;e Tunes to oblige him. How|ever, &s;he would now and then endeavour to lead him into her our own Ta&s;te, and when he required the Repetition of his Ballads, would an&s;wer with a 'Nay, dear Sir,' and would often beg him to &s;uffer her to play &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>This Evening, however, when the Gentleman was retired from his Bottle, &s;he played all his Favourites three Times over, without any Solicitation. This &s;o plea&s;ed the good Squire, that he &s;tarted from his Couch, gave his Daughter a Ki&s;s, and &s;wore her Hand was greatly improved. She took this Oppor|tunity to execute her promi&s;e to <HI>Tom,</HI> in which &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the Squire declared, if &s;he would give him t'other Bout of old Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> he would give the Game-keeper his Deputation the next Morning. Sir <HI>Simon</HI> was played again and again, till the Charms of the Mu&s;ic &s;oothed Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> to &s;leep. In the Morning <HI>Sophia</HI> did not fail to re|mind him of his Engagement, and his Attorney was immediately &s;ent for, ordered to &s;top any further pro|ceedings in the Action, and to make out the Depu|tation.</P>
<P><HI>Tom'</HI>s Succe&s;s in this Affair &s;oon began to ring over the Country, and various were the Cen&s;ures pa&s;t upon

it. Some greatly applauded it as an Act of good Nature, others &s;neering, and &s;aying, 'No Wonder that one idle Fellow &s;hould love another.' Young <HI>Blifil</HI> was greatly enraged at it. He had long hated <HI>Black George</HI> in the &s;ame Proportion as <HI>Jones</HI> delighted in him; not for any offence which he had ever received, but from his great Love to Religion and Virtue: For <HI>Black George</HI> had the Reputation of a loo&s;e kind of a Fellow. <HI>Blifil</HI> therefore repre&s;ented this as flying in Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Face; and declared with great Concern, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to find any other Motive for doing Good to &s;uch a Wretch.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> and <HI>Square</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ung to the &s;ame Tune: They were now (e&s;pecially the latter) become greatly jealous of young <HI>Jones</HI> with the Widow: For he now approached the Age of Twenty, was really a fine young Fellow; and that Lady, by her En|couragements to him, &s;eemed daily more and more to think him &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was not, however, moved with their Malice. He declared him&s;elf very well &s;atisfied with what <HI>Jones</HI> had done. He &s;aid, the Per&s;everance and Integrity of his Friend&s;hip was highly commen|dable, and he wi&s;hed he could &s;ee more frequent In|&s;tances of that Virtue.</P>
<P>But Fortune who &s;eldom greatly reli&s;hes &s;uch Sparks as my Friend <HI>Tom,</HI> perhaps, becau&s;e they do not pay more ardent Addre&s;&s;es to her, gave now a very dif|ferent Turn to all his Actions, and &s;hewed them to Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> in a Light far le&s;s agreeable than that Gentleman's Goodne&s;s had hitherto &s;een them in.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>An Apology for the In&s;en&s;ibility of Mr.</HI> Jones, <HI>to all the Charms of the lovely</HI> Sophia; <HI>in which po&s;&s;ibly we may, in a con&s;iderable Degree, lower his Charac|ter in the E&s;timation of tho&s;e Men of Wit and Gal|lantry, who approve the Heroes in mo&s;t of our modern Comedies.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE are two Sorts of People, who I am afraid, have already conceived &s;ome Contempt for my Heroe, on Account of his Behaviour to <HI>Sophia.</HI> The former of the&s;e will blame his Prudence in ne|glecting an Opportunity to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Fortune; and the latter will no le&s;s de&s;pi&s;e him for his Backwardne&s;s to &s;o fine a Girl, who &s;eemed ready to fly into his Arms, if he would open them to receive her.</P>
<P>Now, though I &s;hall not perhaps be able ab&s;olute|ly to acquit him of either of the&s;e Charges; (for Want of Prudence admits of no Excu&s;e; and what I &s;hall produce again&s;t the latter Charge, will, I apprehend, be &s;carce &s;atisfactory;) yet as Evidence may &s;ome|times be offered in Mitigation, I &s;hall &s;et forth the plain Matter of Fact, and leave the whole to the Rea|der's Determination.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;omewhat about him, which, though I think Writers are not thoroughly agreed in its Name, doth certainly inhabit &s;ome human Brea&s;ts; who&s;e U&s;e is not &s;o properly to di&s;tingui&s;h Right from Wrong, as to prompt and incite them to the former, and to re&s;train and with-hold them from the latter.</P>
<P>This Somewhat may be indeed re&s;embled to the fa|mous Trunk-maker in the Playhou&s;e: for whenever the Per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it doth what is right, no ravi&s;hed or friendly Spectator is &s;o eager, or &s;o loud in his Applau&s;e; on the contrary, when he doth wrong, no Critic is &s;o apt to hi&s;s and explode him.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="173">
To give a higher Idea of the Principle I mean, as well as one more familiar to the pre&s;ent Age; it may be con&s;idered as &s;itting on its Throne in the Mind, like the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR of this King|dom in his Court; where it pre&s;ides, governs, di|rects, judges, acquits and condemns according to Merit and Ju&s;tice; with a Knowledge which nothing e&s;capes, a Penetration which nothing can deceive, and an Integrity which nothing can corrupt.</P>
<P>This Active Principle may perhaps be &s;aid to con|&s;titute the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Barrier between us, and our Neighbours the Brutes; for if there be &s;ome in the human Shape, who are not under any &s;uch Domini|on, I chu&s;e rather to con&s;ider them as De&s;erters from us to our Neighbours; among whom they will have the Fate of De&s;erters, and not be placed in the fir&s;t Rank.</P>
<P>Our Heroe, whether he derived it from <HI>Thwackum</HI> or <HI>Square</HI> I will not determine, was very &s;trongly under the Guidance of this Principle: for though he did not always act rightly, yet he never did other|wi&s;e without feeling and &s;uffering for it. It was this which taught him, that to repay the Civilities and little Friend&s;hips of Ho&s;pitality by robbing the Hou&s;e where you have received them, is to be the ba&s;e&s;t and meane&s;t of Thieves. He did not think the Ba&s;ene&s;s of this Offence le&s;&s;ened by the Height of the Injury committed; on the contrary, if to &s;teal another's Plate de&s;erved Death and Infamy, it &s;eemed to him difficult to a&s;&s;ign a Puni&s;hment adequate to the rob|bing a Man of his whole Fortune, and of his Child into the Bargain.</P>
<P>This Principle therefore prevented him from any Thought of making his Fortune by &s;uch Means (for this, as I have &s;aid, is an active Principle, and doth not content it&s;elf with Knowledge or Belief only.) Had he been greatly enamoured of <HI>Sophia,</HI> he po&s;&s;ibly might have thought otherwi&s;e; but give me Leave to
<PB N="159" REF="174">
&s;ay, there is great Difference between running away with a Man's Daughter from the Motive of Love, and doing the &s;ame Thing from the Motive of Theft.</P>
<P>Now though this young Gentleman was not in&s;en|&s;ible of the Charms of <HI>Sophia;</HI> tho' he greatly liked her Beauty, and e&s;teemed all her other Qualifications, &s;he had made, however, no deep Impre&s;&s;ion on his Heart: For which, as it renders him liable to the Charge of Stupidity, or at lea&s;t of Want of Ta&s;te, we &s;hall now proceed to account.</P>
<P>The Truth then is, his Heart was in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another Woman. Here I que&s;tion not, but the Reader will be &s;urprized at our long Taciturnity as to this Matter; and at no le&s;s Lo&s;s to divine who this Woman was; &s;ince we have hitherto not dropt a Hint of any one likely to be a Rival to <HI>Sophia:</HI> For as to Mrs. <HI>Blifil,</HI> though we have been obliged to mention &s;ome Su&s;picions of her Affection for <HI>Tom,</HI> we have not hitherto given the lea&s;t Latitude for imagining that he had any for her; and, indeed, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, but the Youth of both Sexes are too apt to be de|ficient in their Gratitude, for that Regard with which Per&s;ons more advanced in Years are &s;ometimes &s;o kind to honour them.</P>
<P>That the Reader may be no longer in Su&s;pence, he will be plea&s;ed to remember, that we have often men|tioned the Family of <HI>George Seagrim,</HI> commonly cal|led <HI>Black George,</HI> the Game-keeper, which con&s;i&s;ted at pre&s;ent of a Wife and five Children.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of the&s;e Children was a Daughter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Molly,</HI> and who was e&s;teemed one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Girls in the whole Country.</P>
<P><HI>Congreve</HI> well &s;ays, <HI>There is in true Beauty &s;ome|thing which vulgar Souls cannot admire;</HI> &s;o can no Dirt or Rags hide this Something from tho&s;e Souls which are not of the vulgar Stamp.</P>
<P>The Beauty of this Girl made, however, no Im|pre&s;&s;ion on <HI>Tom,</HI> till &s;he grew towards the Age of

Sixteen, when <HI>Tom,</HI> who was near three Years older, began fir&s;t to ca&s;t the Eyes of Affection upon her. And this Affection he had fixed on the Girl long before he could bring him&s;elf to attempt the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on: for tho' his Con&s;titution urged him greatly to this, his Principles no le&s;s forcibly re&s;trained him. To debauch a young Woman, how|ever low her Condition was, appeared to him a very heinous Crime; and the Good-will he bore the Fa|ther, with the Compa&s;&s;ion he had for his Family, very &s;trongly corroborated all &s;uch &s;ober Reflections; &s;o that he once re&s;olved to get the better of his In|clinations, and he actually ab&s;tained three whole Months without ever going to <HI>Seagrim'</HI>s Hou&s;e, or &s;eeing his Daughter.</P>
<P>Now though <HI>Molly</HI> was, as we have &s;aid, gene|rally thought a very fine Girl, and in reality &s;he was &s;o, yet her Beauty was not of the mo&s;t amiable Kind. It had indeed very little of Feminine in it, and would at lea&s;t have become a Man as well as a Woman; for, to &s;ay the Truth, Youth and florid Health had a very con&s;iderable Share in the Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Nor was her Mind more effeminate than her Per&s;on. As this was tall and robu&s;t, &s;o was that bold and forward. So little had &s;he of Mode&s;ty, that <HI>Jones</HI> had more Regard for her Virtue than &s;he her&s;elf. And as mo&s;t probably &s;he liked <HI>Tom</HI> as well as he liked her, &s;o when &s;he perceived his Backwardne&s;s, &s;he her&s;elf grew proportionably forward; and when &s;he &s;aw he had entirely de&s;erted the Hou&s;e, &s;he found Means of throwing her&s;elf in his Way, and behaved in &s;uch a Manner, that the Youth mu&s;t have had very much, or very little of the Heroe, if her Endeavours had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. In a Word, &s;he &s;oon tri|umphed over all the virtuous Re&s;olutions of <HI>Jones:</HI> For though &s;he behaved at la&s;t with all decent Reluc|tance, yet I rather chu&s;e to attribute the Triumph
<PB N="161" REF="176">
to her, Since, in Fact, it was her De&s;ign which &s;uc|ceeded.</P>
<P>In the Conduct of this Matter, <HI>Molly</HI> &s;o well play|ed her Part, that <HI>Jones</HI> attributed the Conque&s;t en|tirely to him&s;elf, and con&s;idered the young Woman as one who had yielded to the violent Attacks of his Pa&s;&s;ion. He likewi&s;e imputed her yielding, to the ungovernable Force of her Love towards him; and this the Reader will allow to have been a very natural and probable Suppo&s;ition, as we have more than once mentioned the uncommon Comeline&s;s of his Per&s;on: And indeed he was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t young Fel|lows in the World.</P>
<P>As there are &s;ome Minds who&s;e Affections, like Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifl'</HI>s, are &s;olely placed on one &s;ingle Per|&s;on, who&s;e Intere&s;t and indulgence alone they con&s;i|der on every Occa&s;ion; regarding the Good and Ill of all others as merely indifferent, any farther than as they contribute to the Plea&s;ure or Advantage of that Per&s;on: So there is a different Temper of Mind which borrows a Degree of Virtue even from Self-love; &s;uch can never receive any kind of Satisfaction from another, without loving the Creature to whom that Satisfaction is owing, and without making its Well|being in &s;ome &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary to their own Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Of this latter Species was our Heroe. He con&s;i|dered this poor Girl as one who&s;e Happine&s;s or Mi&s;e|ry he had cau&s;ed to be dependent on him&s;elf. Her Beauty was &s;till the Object of De&s;ire, though greater Beauty, or a fre&s;her Object, might have been more &s;o; but the little Abatement which Fruition had oc|ca&s;ioned to this, was highly overballanced by the Con&s;iderations of the Affection which &s;he vi&s;ibly bore him, and of the Situation into which he had brought her. The former of the&s;e created Gratitude, the latter Compa&s;&s;ion; and both together with his De&s;ire for her Per&s;on, rai&s;ed in him a Pa&s;&s;ion, which might, without any great Violence to the Word, be called
<PB N="162" REF="177">
<HI>Love;</HI> though, perhaps, it was at fir&s;t not very judi|ciou&s;ly placed.</P>
<P>This then was the true Rea&s;on of that In&s;en&s;ibility which he had &s;hewn of the Charms of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and of that Behaviour in her, which might have been rea&s;o|nable enough interpreted as an Encouragement to his Addre&s;&s;es: For as he could not think of abandoning his <HI>Molly,</HI> poor and de&s;titute as &s;he was, &s;o no more could he entertain a Notion of betraying &s;uch a Crea|ture as <HI>Sophia.</HI> And &s;urely, had he given the lea&s;t Encouragement to any Pa&s;&s;ion for that young Lady, he mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely guilty of one or other of tho&s;e Crimes; either of which would, in my Opi|nion, have very ju&s;tly &s;ubjected him to that Fate, which at his fir&s;t Introduction into this Hi&s;tory, I mentioned to have been generally predicted as his cer|tain De&s;tiny.</P>

<P>HER Mother fir&s;t perceived the Alteration in the Shape of <HI>Molly,</HI> and in order to hide it from her Neighbours, &s;he fooli&s;hly clothed her in that Sack which <HI>Sophia</HI> had &s;ent her.

<P><HI>Molly</HI> was charmed with the fir&s;t Opportunity &s;he had ever had of &s;hewing her Beauty to Advan|tage; for though &s;he could very well bear to con|template her&s;elf in the Gla&s;s, even when dre&s;t in Rags; and though &s;he had in that Dre&s;s conquered the Heart of <HI>Jones,</HI> and perhaps of &s;ome others; yet &s;he thought the Addition of Finery would much improve her Charms, and extend her Conque&s;ts.</P>

<P><HI>A Battle &s;ung by the Mu&s;e in the</HI> Homerican <HI>Stile, and which none but the cla&s;&s;ical Reader can ta&s;te.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had an E&s;tate in this Pari&s;h; and as his Hou&s;e &s;tood at little greater Di&s;tance from this Church than from his own, he very often came to divine Service here; and both he and the charming <HI>Sophia</HI> happened to be pre&s;ent at this Time.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> was much plea&s;ed with the Beauty of the
<PB N="164" REF="179">
Girl, whom &s;he pitied for her Simplicity, in having dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in that Manner, as &s;he &s;aw the Envy which it had occa&s;ioned among her Equals. She no &s;ooner came home, than &s;he &s;ent for the Game-keep|er, and ordered him to bring his Daughter to her; &s;aying, She would provide for her in the Family, and might po&s;&s;ibly place the Girl about her own Per&s;on, when her own Maid, who was now going away, had left her.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Seagrim</HI> was thunder&s;truck at this; for he was no Stranger to the Fault in the Shape of his Daughter. He an&s;wered, in a &s;tammering Voice, 'That he was afraid <HI>Molly</HI> would be too aukward to wait on her Lady&s;hip, as &s;he had never been at Service.' 'No matter for that,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> '&s;he will &s;oon improve. I am plea&s;ed with the Girl, and am re&s;olved to try her.'</P>
<P><HI>Black George</HI> now repaired to his Wife, on who&s;e prudent Council he depended to extricate him out of this Dilemma; but when he came thither, he found his Hou&s;e in &s;ome Confu&s;ion. So great Envy had this Sack occa&s;ioned, that when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and the other Gentry were gone from Church, the Rage which had hitherto been confined, bur&s;t into an Up|roar, and having vented it&s;elf at fir&s;t in opprobrious Words, Laughs, Hi&s;&s;es, aud Ge&s;tures, betook it&s;elf at la&s;t to certain mi&s;&s;ile Weapons; which, though from their pla&s;tic Nature they threatened neither the Lo&s;s of Life or of Limb, were however &s;ufficiently dreadful to a well-dre&s;&s;ed Lady. <HI>Molly</HI> had too much Spirit to bear this Treatment tamely.

Friend <HI>Butler,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t me on this great Occa&s;ion. All things are not in the Power of all.</P>
<P>As a va&s;t Herd of Cows in a rich Farmer's Yard, if, while they are milked, they hear their Calves at a Di&s;tance lamenting the Robbery which is then com|mitting, roar and bellow: So roared forth the <HI>Somer|&s;et&s;hire</HI> Mob an Hallaloo, made up of almo&s;t as many Squawls, Screams, and other different Sounds, as there were Per&s;ons, or indeed Pa&s;&s;ions, among them: Some were in&s;pired by Rage, others alarmed by Fear, and others had nothing in their Heads but the Love of Fun; but chiefly Envy, the Si&s;ter of <HI>Satan,</HI> and his con&s;tant Companion, ru&s;hed among the Crowd, and blew up the Fury of the Women; who no &s;ooner came up to <HI>Molly,</HI> than they pelted her with Dirt and Rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Molly,</HI> having endeavoured in vain to make a hand&s;ome Retreat, faced about; and laying hold of ragged <HI>Be&s;s,</HI> who advanced in the Front of the Ene|my, &s;he at one Blow felled her to the Ground. The whole Army of the Enemy (though near a hundred in Number) &s;eeing the Fate of their General, gave back many Paces, and retired behind a new-dug Grave; for the Church-yard was the Field of Battle, where there was to be a Funeral that very Evening. <HI>Molly</HI> pur&s;ued her Victory, and catching up a Skull which lay on the Side of the Grave, di&s;charged it with &s;uch Fury, that having hit a Taylor on the Head, the two Skulls &s;ent equally forth a hollow Sound at their Meeting, and the Taylor took pre&s;ently mea&s;ure of his Length on the Ground, where the Skulls lay &s;ide by &s;ide, and it was doubtful which was the mo&s;t va|luable of the two. <HI>Molly</HI> then taking a Thigh Bone in her Hand, fell in among the flying Ranks, and dealing her Blows with great Liberality neither Side, overthrew the Carca&s;s of many a mighty Heroe and Heroine.</P>
<P>Recount, O Mu&s;e, the Names of tho&s;e who fell
<PB N="166" REF="181">
on this fatal Day. Fir&s;t <HI>Jemmy Tweedle</HI> felt on his hinder Head the direful Bone. Him the plea&s;ant Bank of &s;weetly winding <HI>Stower</HI> had nouri&s;hed, where he fir&s;t learnt the vocal Art, with which, wandering up and down at Wakes and Fairs, he cheered the rural Nymphs and Swains, when upon the Green they interweave the &s;prightly Dance; while he him&s;elf &s;tood fidling and jumping to his own Mu&s;ic. How little now avails his Fiddle? He thumps the verdant Floor with his Carca&s;s. Next old <HI>Echepole,</HI> the Sow|gelder, received a Blow in his Forehead from our Amazonian Heroine, and immediately fell to the Ground. He was a &s;winging fat Fellow, and fell with almo&s;t as much Noi&s;e as a Hou&s;e. His Tobac|co-box dropt at the &s;ame Time from his Pocket, which <HI>Molly</HI> took up as lawful Spoils. Then <HI>Kate</HI> of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a Tomb&s;tone, which catching hold of her ungartered Stocking, in|verted the Order of Nature, and gave her Heels the Superiority to her Head. <HI>Betty Pippin,</HI> with young <HI>Roger</HI> her Lover, fell both to the Ground. Where, O perver&s;e Fate, &s;he &s;alutes the Earth, and he the Sky. <HI>Tom Freckle,</HI> the Smith's Son, was the next Victim to her Rage. He was an ingenious Work|man, and made excellent Pattins; nay the very Pat|tin with which he was knocked down was his own Workman&s;hip. Had he been at that Time &s;inging P&s;alms in the Church, he would have avoided a bro|ken Head. Mi&s;s <HI>Crow,</HI> the Daughter of a Farmer; <HI>John Giddi&s;h,</HI> him&s;elf a Farmer; <HI>Nan Slouch, E&s;ther Codling, Will Spray, Tom Bennet;</HI> the three Mi&s;&s;es <HI>Potter,</HI> who&s;e Father keeps the Sign of the <HI>Red Lion. Betty Chambermaid, Jack O&s;tler,</HI> and many others of inferior Note, lay rolling among the Graves.</P>
<P>Not that the &s;trenuous Arm of <HI>Molly</HI> reached all the&s;e; for many of them in their Flight overthrew each other.</P>
<P>But now Fortune fearing &s;he had acted out of Cha|racter,
<PB N="167" REF="182">
and had inclined too long to the &s;ame Side, e&s;pecially as it was the right Side, ha&s;tily turned about: For now Goody <HI>Brown,</HI> whom <HI>Zekiel Brown</HI> care&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es in his Arms; nor he alone, but half the Pari&s;h be|&s;ides; &s;o famous was &s;he in the Fields of <HI>Venus,</HI> nor indeed le&s;s in tho&s;e of <HI>Mars.</HI> The Trophies of both the&s;e, her Husband always bore about on his Head and Face; for if ever human Head did by its Horns di&s;play the amorous Glories of a Wife, <HI>Zekiel'</HI>s did; nor did his well-&s;cratched Face le&s;s denote her Talents (or rather Talons) of a different Kind.</P>
<P>No longer bore this Amazon the &s;hameful Flight of her Party. She &s;topt &s;hort, and calling aloud to all who fled, &s;poke as follows: 'Ye <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> Men, or rather ye <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> Women, are ye not a&s;hamed, thus to fly from a &s;ingle Woman; but if no other will oppo&s;e her, I my&s;elf and <HI>Joan Top</HI> here will have the Honour of the Victory.' Having thus &s;aid, &s;he flew at <HI>Molly Seagrim,</HI> and ea&s;ily wrench|ed the Thigh Bone from her Hand, at the &s;ame Time clawing off her Cap from her Head. Then laying hold of the Hair of <HI>Molly,</HI> with her Left Hand, &s;he attacked her &s;o furiou&s;ly in the Face with the Right, that the Blood &s;oon began to trickle from her No&s;e. <HI>Molly</HI> was not idle this while. She &s;oon removed the Clout from the Head of Goody <HI>Brown,</HI> and then fa&s;tening on her Hair with one Hand, with the other &s;he cau&s;ed the &s;ame bloody Stream to i&s;&s;ue forth from the No&s;tril of the Enemy.</P>
<P>When each of the Combatants had bore off &s;uffi|cient Spoils of Hair from the Head of her Antagoni&s;t, the next Rage was again&s;t their Garments. In this Attack they exerted &s;o much Violence, that in a very few Minutes, they were both naked to the middle.</P>
<P>It is lucky for the Women, that the Seat of Fi&s;ty|cuff-War is not the &s;ame with them as among Men; but though they may &s;eem a little to deviate from their Sex, when they go forth to Battle, yet I have ob|&s;erved

they never &s;o far forget it, as to a&s;&s;ail the Bo|&s;om, of each other; where a few Blows would be fa|tal to mo&s;t of them.

On which Account they apply to the No&s;e, as to the Part whence Blood may mo&s;t ea&s;ily be drawn; but this &s;eems a far-fetched, as well as illnatured Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Goody <HI>Brown</HI> had great Advantage of <HI>Molly</HI> in this Particular; for the former had indeed no Brea&s;ts, her Bo&s;om (if it may be &s;o called) as well in Colour as in many other Properties, exactly re&s;embling an an|tient Piece of Parchment, upon which any one might have drummed a con&s;iderable while, without doing her any great Damage.</P>
<P><HI>Molly,</HI> be&s;ides her pre&s;ent unhappy Condition, was differently formed in tho&s;e Parts, and might, perhaps, have attempted the Envy of <HI>Brown</HI> to give a her fatal Blow, had not the lucky Arrival of <HI>Tom Jones</HI> at this In&s;tant put an immediate End to the bloody Scene.</P>
<P>This Accident was luckily owing to Mr. <HI>Square;</HI> for he, Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> and <HI>Jones,</HI> had mounted their Hor&s;es, after Church, to take the Air, and had rid|den about a Quarter of a Mile, when <HI>Square,</HI> chang|ing his Mind, (not idly, but for a Rea&s;on which we &s;hall unfold as &s;oon as we have Lei&s;ure) de&s;ired the young Gentlemen to ride with him another Way than they had at fir&s;t purpo&s;ed.

<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Blifil,</HI> who rode fir&s;t, &s;eeing &s;uch a Mob a&s;&s;embled, and two Women in the Po&s;ture in which we left the Combatants, &s;topt his Hor&s;e to enquire what was the Matter.

(for he had not well under&s;tood the Phra&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed by <HI>Sophia</HI> of being about her Per&s;on) 'I &s;uppo&s;e it is to be under the Cook; but I &s;han't wa&s;h Di&s;hes for any Body. My Gentleman will provide better for me. See what he hath given me this After|noon; he hath promi&s;ed I &s;hall never want Money; and you &s;han't want Money neither, Mother, if you will hold your Tongue, and know when you are well.' And &s;o &s;aying, &s;he pulled out &s;everal Guineas, and gave her Mother one of them.</P>
<P>The good Woman no &s;ooner felt the Gold with|in her Palm, than her Temper began (&s;uch is the Ef|ficacy of that <HI>Panacea)</HI> to be mollified. 'Why Hu&s;band,' &s;ays &s;he, 'would any but &s;uch a Block|head as you not have enquired what Place this was before he had accepted it! Perhaps, as <HI>Molly</HI> &s;ays, it may be in the Kitchen, and truly I don't care my Daughter &s;hould be a Scullion Wench: For poor as I am, I am a Gentlewoman. And thof I was obliged, as my Father, who was a Clergyman died wor&s;e than nothing, and &s;o could not give me a Shilling of <HI>Potion,</HI> to undervalue my&s;elf, by mar|rying a poor Man, yet I would have you to know,

I have a Spirit above all <HI>them</HI> Things. Marry come up, it would better become Madam <HI>We&s;tern</HI> to look at Home, and remember who her own Grandfather was.

<P><HI>Black George</HI> was, in the main, a peaceable kind of Fellow, and nothing <HI>choleric, nor ra&s;h,</HI> yet did he bear about him &s;omething of what the Antients called the <HI>Ira&s;cible,</HI> and which his Wife, if &s;he had been endowed with much <HI>Wi&s;dom, would have feared.</HI> He had long experienced, that when the Storm grew very high Arguments were but Wind, which &s;erved rather to increa&s;e than to abate it. He was therefore &s;eldom unprovided with a &s;mall Switch, a Remedy of wonderful Force, as he had often e&s;&s;ayed, and which the Word Villain &s;erved as a Hint for his ap|plying.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner, therefore, had this Symptom appeared, than he had immediate Recour&s;e to the &s;aid Remedy, which though, as it is u&s;ual in all very efficacious
<PB N="173" REF="188">
Medicines, it at fir&s;t &s;eemed to heighten and inflame the Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;oon produced a total Calm, and re&s;tored the Patient to perfect Ea&s;e and Tranquillity.</P>
<P>This is, however, a kind of Hor&s;e-medicine, which requires a very robu&s;t Con&s;titution to dige&s;t, and is therefore only proper for the Vulgar, unle&s;s in one &s;ingle In&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> where Superiority of Birth breaks out; in which Ca&s;e, we &s;hould not think it very im|properly applied by any Hu&s;band whatever, if the Application was not, in it&s;elf &s;o ba&s;e, that, like certain Applications of the Phy&s;ical Kind which need not be mentioned, it &s;o much degrades and contaminates the Hand employed in it, that no Gentleman &s;hould en|dure the Thought of any Thing &s;o low and dete&s;t|able.</P>
<P>The whole Family were &s;oon reduced to a State of perfect Quiet: For the Virtue of this Medicine, like that of Electricity, is often communicated through one Per&s;on to many others, who are not touched by the In&s;trument. To &s;ay the Truth, as they both operate by Friction, it may be doubted whether there is not &s;omething analogous between them, of which Mr. <HI>Freke</HI> would do well to enquire before he pub|li&s;hes the next Edition of his Book.</P>
<P>A Council was now called, in which, after many Debates, <HI>Molly</HI> &s;till per&s;i&s;ting that &s;he would not go to Service, it was at length re&s;olved, that Goody <HI>Seagrim</HI> her&s;elf &s;hould wait on Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and endeavour to procure the Place for her elder Daugh|ter, who declared great Readine&s;s to accept it; but Fortune, who &s;eems to have been an Enemy of this little Family, afterwards put a Stop to her Promotion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Story told by Mr.</HI> Supple, <HI>the Curate. The Pene|tration of Squire</HI> We&s;tern. <HI>His great Love for his Daughter, and the Return to it made by her.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE next Morning <HI>Tom Jones</HI> hunted with Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and was at his Return invited by that Gentleman to Dinner.</P>
<P>The lovely <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;hone forth that Day with more Gaiety and Sprightline&s;s than u&s;ual. Her Battery was certainly levelled at our Heroe; though, I be|lieve, &s;he her&s;elf &s;carce yet knew her own Intention; but if &s;he had any De&s;ign of charming him, &s;he now &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Supple,</HI> the Curate of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Pari&s;h, made one of the Company. He was a goood-natur|ed worthy Man; but chiefly remarkable for his great Taciturnity at Table, though his Mouth was never &s;hut at it. In &s;hort, he had one of the be&s;t Appetites in the World. However, the Cloth was no &s;ooner taken away, than he always made &s;ufficient Amends for his Silence: For he was a very hearty Fellow; and his Conver&s;ation was often entertaining, never offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t Arrival, which was immediately before the Entrance of the Roa&s;t-beef, he had given an Intimation that he had brought &s;ome News with him, and was beginning to tell, that he came that Moment from Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s, when the Sight of the Roa&s;t|beef, &s;truck him dumb, permitting him only to &s;ay Grace, and to declare he mu&s;t pay his Re&s;pect to the Baronet: For &s;o he called the Sirloin.</P>
<P>When Dinner was over, being reminded by <HI>Sophia</HI> of his News, he began as follows, 'I believe, Lady, your Lady&s;hip ob&s;erved a young Woman at Church ye&s;terday at Even-&s;ong, who was dre&s;t in one of your outlandi&s;h Garments; I think I have &s;een

<Q>Raro avis in Terris, nigro&abque; &s;imillima Cycno,</Q>
<P>That is, Madam, as much as to &s;ay,</P>
<Q>'A rare Bird upon the Earth, and very like a' black Swan.</Q>
<P>'The Ver&s;e is in <HI>Juvenal:</HI> but to return to what I was relating. I was &s;aying &s;uch Garments are rare Sights in the Country, and perchance too, it was thought the more rare, Re&s;pect being had to the Per&s;on who wore it, who, they tell me, is the Daughter of <HI>Black George,</HI> your Wor&s;hip's Game|keeper, who&s;e Sufferings I &s;hould have opined, might have taught him more Wit than to dre&s;s forth his Wenches in &s;uch gaudy Apparel. She created &s;o much Confu&s;ion in the Congregation, that if Squire <HI>Allworthy</HI> had not &s;ilenced it, it would have interrupted the Service: For I was once about to &s;top in the Middle of the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on. Howbeit, neverthele&s;s, after Prayer was over, and I was de|parted home, this occa&s;ioned a Battle in the Church|yard, where, among&s;t other Mi&s;chief, the Head of a travelling Fidler was very much broken. This Morning the Fidler came to Squire <HI>Allworthy</HI> for a Warrant, and the Wench was brought before him. The Squire was inclined to have compounded Mat|ters; when, lo! on a &s;udden, the Wench appeared (I a&s;k your Lady&s;hip Pardon) to be, as it were at the Eve of bringing forth a Ba&s;tard. The Squire demanded of her who was the Father; but &s;he per|tinaciou&s;ly refu&s;ed to make any Re&s;pon&s;e. So that he was about to make her Mittimus to <HI>Bridewel,'</HI> when I departed.'</P>
<P>'And is a Wench having a Ba&s;tard all your News, Doctor? cries <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> 'I thought it might have been &s;ome public Matter, &s;omething about the Na|tion.'</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="191">
'I am afraid it is too common, indeed,' an&s;wer|ed the Par&s;on, 'but I thought the whole Story al|together de&s;erved commemorating. As to Natio|nal Matters, your Wor&s;hip knows them be&s;t. My Concerns extend no farther than my own Pari&s;h.'</P>
<P>'Why ay,' &s;ays the Squire.' 'I believe I do know a little Matter, as you &s;ay; but come, <HI>Tommy,</HI> drink about, the Bottle &s;tands with you.'</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> begged to be excu&s;ed, for that he had parti|cular Bu&s;ine&s;s; and getting up from Table, e&s;caped the Clutches of the Squire who was ri&s;ing to &s;top him, and went off with very little Ceremony.</P>
<P>The Squire gave him a good Cur&s;e at his Depar|ture; and then turning to the Par&s;on, he cried out, 'I &s;moke it, I &s;moke it. <HI>Tom</HI> is certainly the Fa|ther of this Ba&s;tard.' 'Zooks, Par&s;on, you re|member how he recommended the Veather o'her to me&mdash;d&mdash;n un, what a &s;ly B&mdash;ch 'tis. Ay ay, as &s;ure as Two-pence, <HI>Tom</HI> is Veather of the Ba&s;|tard.'</P>
<P>'I &s;hould be very &s;orry for that,' &s;ays the Par&s;on. 'Why &s;orry, cries the Squire, Where is the mighty Matter o't? What I &s;uppo&s;e, do&s;t pretend that thee ha&s;t never got a Ba&s;tard? Pox! more good Luck's thine: for I warrant ha&s;t done <HI>therefore</HI> many's the good Time and often. 'Your Wor&s;hip is plea&s;ed to be jocular,' an&s;wered the Par&s;on, but I do not only animadvert on the Sinfulne&s;s of the Ac|tion, though that &s;urely is to be greatly depreca|ted; but I fear his Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s may injure him with Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> And truly I mu&s;t &s;ay, though he hath the Character of being a little wild, I never &s;aw any Harm in the young Man; nor can I &s;ay I have heard any, &s;ave what your Wor&s;hip now men|tions. I wi&s;h, indeed he was a little more regular in his Re&s;pon&s;es at Church; but altogether he &s;eems.'</P>

'That is a cla&s;&s;ical Line, young Lady, and being rendered into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is, a A Lad of an ingenuous Countenance and of an ingenuous Mode&s;ty: For this was a Virtue in great Repute both among the <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Greeks.</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay the young Gentle|man (for &s;o I think I may call him, notwith&s;tand|ing his Birth) appears to me a very mode&s;t, civil Lad, and I &s;hould be &s;orry that he &s;hould do him&s;elf any Injury in Squire <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Opinion.'</P>
<P>'Poogh! &s;ays the Squire, 'Injury with <HI>Allwor|thy!</HI> Why <HI>Allworthy</HI> loves a Wench him&s;elf. Doth not all the Country know who&s;e Son <HI>Tom</HI> is? You mu&s;t talk to another Per&s;on in that Manner. I remember <HI>Allworthy</HI> at College.'</P>
<P>'I thought,' &s;aid the Par&s;on, 'he had never been at the Univer&s;ity.'</P>
<P>'Yes, yes, he was,' &s;ays the Squire, 'and many a Wench have we two had together. As errant a Whorema&s;ter as any within five Miles o'un. No, no.

<P>This was a cruel Que&s;tion to poor <HI>Sophia.</HI> She had ob&s;erved <HI>Tom'</HI>s Colour change at the Par&s;on's Story; and that, with his ha&s;ty and abrupt Departure, gave her &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to think her Father's Su&s;pi|cion not groundle&s;s. Her Heart now, at once, di&s;|covered the great Secret to her, which had been &s;o long di&s;clo&s;ing by little and little; and &s;he found her|&s;elf highly intere&s;ted in this Matter. In &s;uch a Si|tuation, her Father's malapert Que&s;tion ru&s;hing &s;ud|denly upon her, produced &s;ome Symptoms which might have alarmed a Su&s;picious Heart; but to do the Squire Ju&s;tice, that was not his Fault. When &s;he ro&s;e therefore from her Chair, and told him, a Hint from him was always &s;ufficient to make her with|draw,
<PB N="178" REF="193">
he &s;uffered her to leave the Room; and then with great Gravity of Countenance remarked, 'that it was better to &s;ee a Daughter over-mode&s;t, than o|ver forward;' a Sentiment which was highly ap|plauded by the Par&s;on.</P>
<P>There now en&s;ued between the Squire and the Par|&s;on, a mo&s;t excellent political Di&s;cour&s;e, framed out of News-Papers, and political Pamphlets,; in which they made a Libation of four Bottles of Wine to the Good of their Country; and then, the Squire being fa&s;t a&s;leep, the Par&s;on lighted his Pipe, mounted his Hor&s;e, and rode home.</P>
<P>When the Squire had fini&s;hed his Half-hour's Nap, he &s;ummoned his Daughter to her Harp&s;ichord; but &s;he begged to be excu&s;ed that Evening, on Account of a violent Head-ach. This Remi&s;&s;ion was pre|&s;ently granted: For indeed &s;he &s;eldom had Occa&s;ion to a&s;k him twice, as he loved her with &s;uch ardent Affection, that by gratifying her, he commonly con|veyed the highe&s;t Gratification to him&s;elf. She was really what he frequently called her, his little Dar|ling; and &s;he well de&s;erved to be &s;o: For &s;he returned all his Affection in the mo&s;t ample Manner. She had pre&s;erved the mo&s;t inviolable Duty to him in all Things; and this her Love made not only ea&s;y, but &s;o delightful, that when one of her Companions laugh|ed at her for placing &s;o much Merit in &s;uch &s;crupulous Obedience, as that young Lady called it, <HI>Sophia</HI> an|&s;wered, 'You mi&s;take me, Madam, if you think I value my&s;elf upon this Account: For be&s;ides that I am barely di&s;charging my Duty, I am likewi&s;e plea&s;ing my&s;elf. I can truly &s;ay, I have no De|light equal to that of contributing to my Father's Happine&s;s; and if I value my&s;elf, my Dear, it is on having this Power, and not on executing it.'</P>
<P>This was a Satisfaction, however, which poor <HI>So|phia</HI> was incapable of ta&s;ting this Evening. She therefore not only de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from the At|tendance
<PB N="179" REF="194">
at the Harp&s;ichord, but likewi&s;e begged that he would &s;uffer her to ab&s;ent her&s;elf from Supper. To this Reque&s;t likewi&s;e the Squire agreed, though not without &s;ome Reluctance; for he &s;carce ever permit|ted her to be out of his Sight, unle&s;s when he was engaged, with his Hor&s;es, Dogs, or Bottle. Ne|verthele&s;s he yielded to the De&s;ire of his Daughter, though the poor Man was, at the &s;ame Time, obliged to avoid his own Company, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) by &s;ending for a neighbouring Farmer to &s;it with him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The narrow e&s;cape of</HI> Molly Seagrim, <HI>with &s;ome Ob|&s;ervations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into Nature.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>TOM JONES</HI> had ridden one of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Hor&s;es that Morning in the Chace: &s;o that having no Hor&s;e of his own in the Squire's Stable, he was obliged to go home on Foot. This he did &s;o expeditiou&s;ly; that he ran upwards of three Miles within the half Hour.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he arrived at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s outward Gate, he met the Con&s;table and Company, with <HI>Molly</HI> in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whom they were conducting to that Hou&s;e where the inferior Sort of People may learn one good Le&s;&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> Re&s;pect and Deference to their Superiors. Since it mu&s;t &s;hew them the wide Di&s;tinction Fortune intends between tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are to be corrected for their Faults, and tho&s;e who are not; which Le&s;&s;on, if they do not learn, I am afraid, they very rarely learn any other good Le&s;&s;on, or improve their Morals, at the Hou&s;e of Correction.</P>
<P>A Lawyer may, perhaps, think Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> ex|ceeded his Authority a little in this In&s;tance. And, to &s;ay the Truth, I que&s;tion, as here was no regular
<PB N="180" REF="195">
Information before him, whether his Conduct was &s;trictly regular. However, as his Intention was tru|ly upright, he ought to be excu&s;ed in <HI>Foro Con&s;cientiae,</HI> &s;ince &s;o many arbitrary Acts are daily committed by Magi&s;trates, who have not this Excu&s;e to plead for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> was no &s;ooner informed by the Con&s;table, whither they were proceeding, (indeed he pretty well gue&s;&s;ed it of him&s;elf) than he caught <HI>Molly</HI> in his Arms, and embracing her tenderly before them all, &s;wore he would murder the fir&s;t Man who offered to lay hold of her. He bid her dry her Eyes, and be comforted; for wherever &s;he went, he would accom|pany her. Then turning to the Con&s;table, who &s;tood trembling with his Hat off, he de&s;ired him, in a very mild Voice, to return with him for a Moment only to his Father, (&s;o he now called <HI>Allworthy)</HI> for he dur&s;t, he &s;aid, be a&s;&s;ured, that when he had alledged what he had to &s;ay in her Favour, the Girl would be di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table, who, I make no Doubt, would have &s;urrendered his Pri&s;oner, had <HI>Tom</HI> demanded her, very readily con&s;ented to this Reque&s;t. So back they all went into Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Hall; where <HI>Tom</HI> de&s;ired them to &s;tay till his Return, and then went him&s;elf in pur&s;uit of the Good Man. As &s;oon as he was found, <HI>Tom</HI> threw him&s;elf at his Feet, and having begged a patient hearing, confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be the Father of the Child, of which <HI>Molly</HI> was then big. He en|treated him to have Compa&s;&s;ion on the poor Girl, and to con&s;ider, if there was any Guilt in the ca&s;e, it lay principally at his Door.</P>
<P>'If there is any Guilt in the Ca&s;e!' an&s;wered <HI>All|worthy</HI> warmly, 'are you then &s;o profligate and &s;o abandoned a Libertine, to doubt whether the break|ing the Laws of God and Man, the corrupting and ruining a poor Girl, by Guilt? I own, indeed, it
<PB N="181" REF="196">
doth lie principally upon you, and &s;o heavy it is, that you ought to expect it &s;hould cru&s;h you.'</P>
<P>'Whatever may be my Fate, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI> let me &s;ucceed in my Interce&s;&s;ions for the poor Girl. I con&s;e&s;s I have corrupted her; but whether &s;he &s;hall be ruined depends on you. For Heaven's Sake, Sir, revoke your Warrant, and do not &s;end her to a Place which mu&s;t unavoidably prove her De&s;truc|tion.'</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> bid him immediately call a Servant. <HI>Tom</HI> an&s;wered, there was no Occa&s;ion; for he had luckily met them at the Gate, and relying upon his Goodne&s;s, had brought them back into his Hall, where they now waited his final Re&s;olution, which, upon his Knees, he be&s;ought him might be in Favour of the Girl; that &s;he might be permitted to go home to her Parents, and not be expo&s;ed to a greater Degree of Shame and Scorn than mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall upon her. 'I know, &s;aid he, that is too much, I know I am the wicked Occa&s;ion of it. I will endeavour to make amends, if po&s;&s;ible; and if you &s;hall have hereafter the Goodne&s;s to forgive me, I hope I &s;hall de&s;erve it.'</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> he&s;itated &s;ome Time, and at la&s;t &s;aid, 'Well, I will di&s;charge my Mittimus.&mdash;You may &s;end the Con&s;table to me.' He was in&s;tantly called, di&s;charged, and &s;o was the Girl.</P>
<P>It will be believed, that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> failed not to read <HI>Tom</HI> a very &s;evere Lecture on this Occa&s;ion; but it is unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert it here, as we have faithfully tran&s;cribed what he &s;aid to <HI>Jenny Jones</HI> in the fir&s;t Book, mo&s;t of which may be applied to the Men, equally with the Women. So &s;en&s;ible an Effect had the&s;e Reproofs on the young Man, who is no har|dened Sinner, that he retired into his own Room, where he pa&s;&s;ed the Evening alone in much melancholy con|templation.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="197">
<HI>Allworthy</HI> was &s;ufficiently offended by this Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Jones;</HI> for notwith&s;tanding the A&s;&s;ertions of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> it is certain this worthy Man had never indulged him&s;elf in any loo&s;e Plea&s;ures with Women, and greatly condemned the Vice of Incon|tinence in others. Indeed, there is much Rea&s;on to imagine, that there was not the lea&s;t Truth in what Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> affirmed, e&s;pecially as he laid the Scene of tho&s;e Impurities at the Univer&s;ity, where Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> had never been. In fact, the good Squire was a little too apt to indulge that Kind of Plea&s;anty which is generally called <HI>Rhodomontade;</HI> but which may, with as much Propriety, be expre&s;&s;ed by a much shorter Word; and, perhaps, we too often &s;upply the U&s;e of this little Mono&s;yllable by others; &s;ince very much of what frequently pa&s;&s;es in the World for Wit and Humour, &s;hould, in the &s;tricte&s;t Purity of Language, receive that &s;hort Appellation, which, in Conformity to the well-bred Laws of Cu&s;tom, I here &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>But whatever Dete&s;tation Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had to this or to any other Vice, he was not &s;o blinded by it, but that he could di&s;cern any Virtue in the guilty Per&s;on, as clearly indeed, as if there had been no Mixture of Vice in the &s;ame Character. While he was angry there|fore, with the Incontinence of <HI>Jones,</HI> he was no le&s;s plea&s;ed with the Honour and Hone&s;ty of his Self-ac|cu&s;ation. He began now to form in his Mind the &s;ame Opinion of this young Fellow which we hope our Reader may have conceived. And in ballancing his Faults with his Perfections, the latter &s;eemed ra|ther to preponderate.</P>
<P>It was to no Purpo&s;e, therefore, that <HI>Thwackum,</HI> who was immediately charged by Mr. <HI>Blifl</HI> with the Story, unbended all his Rancour again&s;t poor <HI>Tom. Allworthy</HI> gave a patient Hearing to the&s;e Invectives, and then an&s;wered coldly: 'That young Men of <HI>Tom'</HI>s Complexion were too generally addicted
<PB N="183" REF="198">
to this Vice; but he believed that Youth was &s;in|cerely affected with what he had &s;aid to him on the Occa&s;ion, and he hoped he would not tran&s;gre&s;s again.' So that, as the Days of whipping were at an End, the Tutor had no other Vent but his own Mouth for his Gall, the u&s;ual poor Re&s;ource of impo|tent Revenge.</P>
<P>But <HI>Square,</HI> who was a le&s;s violent, was a much more artful Man; and as he hated <HI>Jones</HI> more, per|haps, than <HI>Thwackum</HI> him&s;elf, &s;o he contrived to do him more Mi&s;chief in the Mind of Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader mu&s;t remember the &s;everal little In|cidents of the Partridge, the Hor&s;e, and the Bible, which were recounted in the &s;econd Book. By all which <HI>Jones</HI> had rather improved than injured the Affection which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was inclined to en|tertain for him. The &s;ame, I believe, mu&s;t have happened to him with every other Per&s;on who hath any Idea of Friend&s;hip, Genero&s;ity, and Greatne&s;s of Spirit; that is to &s;ay, who hath any Traces of Goodne&s;s in his Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> him&s;elf was not unacquainted with the true Impre&s;&s;ion which tho&s;e &s;everal In&s;tances of Goodne&s;s had made on the excellent Heart of <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for the Philo&s;opher very well knew what Virtue was, though he was not always, perhaps, &s;teady in its Pur&s;uit; but as for <HI>Thwackum,</HI> from what Rea&s;on I will not determine, no &s;uch Thoughts ever entered into his Head. He &s;aw <HI>Jones</HI> in a bad Light, and he imagined <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;aw him in the &s;ame, but that he was re&s;olved, from Pride and Stubbornne&s;s of Spirit, not to give up the Boy whom he had once cheri&s;hed, &s;ince, by &s;o doing, he mu&s;t tacitly acknow|ledge that his former Opinion of him had been wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> therefore embraced this Opportunity of injuring <HI>Jones</HI> in the tendere&s;t Part, by giving a very bad Turn to all the&s;e before-mentioned Occurrences.</P>
<P>'I am &s;orry, Sir, &s;aid he, 'to own I have been de|ceived
<PB N="184" REF="199">
as well as your&s;elf. I could not, I confe&s;s, help being plea&s;ed with what I a&s;cribed to the Mo|tive of Friend&s;hip, though it was carried to an Exce&s;s, and all Exce&s;s is faulty, and vicious; but in this I made Allowance for Youth. Little did I &s;u&s;pect that the Sacrifice of Truth, which we both imagined to have been made to Friend&s;hip, was, in reality, a Pro&s;titution of it to a depraved and debauched Appe|tite. You now plainly &s;ee whence all the &s;eeming Ge|nero&s;ity of this young Man to the Family of the Game-keeper proceeded. He &s;upported the Father in order to corrupt the Daughter, and pre&s;erved the Family from &s;tarving, to bring one of them to Shame and Ruin. This is Friend&s;hip! this is Ge|nero&s;ity! As Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> &s;ays, Gluttons who give high Prices for Delicacies, are very worthy to be called generous. In &s;hort, I am re&s;olved, from this In&s;tance, never to give Way to the Weak|ne&s;s of Human Nature more, nor to think any thing Virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the unerring Rule of Right.'</P>
<P>The Goodne&s;s of <HI>Allworthy</HI> had prevented tho&s;e Con&s;iderations from occurring to him&s;elf; yet were they too plau&s;ible to be ab&s;olutely and ha&s;tily rejected, when laid before his Eyes by another. Indeed what <HI>Square</HI> had &s;aid &s;unk very deeply into his Mind, and the Unea&s;ine&s;s which it there created was very vi&s;ible to the other; though the good Man would not ac|knowledge this, but made a very &s;light An&s;wer, and forcibly drove off the Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ome other Sub|ject. It was well, perhaps, for poor <HI>Tom,</HI> that no &s;uch Sugge&s;tions had been made before he was par|doned; for they certainly &s;tamped in the Mind of <HI>Allworthy</HI> the fir&s;t bad Impre&s;&s;ion concerning <HI>Jones.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing much clearer Matters; but which flow from the &s;ame Fountain with tho&s;e in the preceding Chapter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader will be plea&s;ed, I believe, to return with me to <HI>Sophia.</HI> She pa&s;&s;ed the Night, af|ter we &s;aw her la&s;t, in no very agreeable Manner. Sleep befriended her but little, and Dreams le&s;s. In the Morning, when Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> her Maid at|tended her, at the u&s;ual Hour, &s;he was found already up and dre&s;t.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who live two or three Miles Di&s;tance in the Country are con&s;idered as next Door Neighbours, and Tran&s;actions at the one Hou&s;e fly with incre|dible Celerity to the other. Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> therefore, had heard the whole Story of <HI>Molly'</HI>s Shame; which &s;he, being of a very communicative Temper, had no &s;ooner entered the Apartment of her Mi&s;tre&s;s, than &s;he began to relate in the following Manner.</P>
<P>'La Ma'am, what doth your La'&s;hip think? the Girl that your La'&s;hip &s;aw at Church on <HI>Sunday,</HI> whom you thought &s;o hand&s;ome; though you would not have thought her &s;o hand&s;ome neither, if you had &s;een her nearer; but to be &s;ure &s;he hath been carried before the Ju&s;tice for being big with Child. She &s;eemed to me to look like a confident Slut; and to be &s;ure &s;he hath laid the Child to young Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> And all the Pari&s;h &s;ays Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> is &s;o angry with young Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that he won't &s;ee him. To be &s;ure, one can't help pitying the poor young Man, and yet he doth not de&s;erve much Pity nei|ther, for demeaning him&s;elf with &s;uch Kind of Trumpery. Yet he is &s;o pretty a Gentleman I &s;hould be &s;orry to have him turned out of Doors. I dares to &s;wear the Wench was as willing as he; for &s;he was always a forward Kind of Body. And
<PB N="186" REF="201">
when Wenches are &s;o coming, young Men are not &s;o much to be blamed neither; for to be &s;ure they do no more than what is natural. Indeed it is be|neath them to meddle with &s;uch dirty Draggle-tails, and whatever happens to them, it is good enough for them. And yet to be &s;ure the vile Baggages are mo&s;t in Fault. I wi&s;hes, with all my Heart, they were well to be whipped the Cart's Tail; for it is Pity they &s;hould be the Ruin of a pretty young Gentleman; and no body can deny but that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> is one of the mo&s;t hand&s;ome&s;t young Men that ever&mdash;'</P>
<P>She was running on thus, when <HI>Sophia,</HI> with a more peevi&s;h Voice than &s;he had ever &s;poken to her in be|fore, cried, 'Prithee why do'&s;t thou trouble me with all this Stuff? What Concern have I in what Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> doth? I &s;uppo&s;e you are all alike. And you &s;eem to me to be angry it was not your own Ca&s;e.'</P>
<P>'I, Ma'am!' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> I am &s;orry your Lady&s;hip &s;hould have &s;uch an Opinion of me. I am &s;ure nobody can &s;ay any &s;uch thing of me. All the young Fellows in the World may go to the <HI>Divil,</HI> for me. Becau&s;e I &s;aid he was a hand&s;ome Man! Every body &s;ays it as well as I&mdash;To be &s;ure, I never thought as it was any Harm to &s;ay a young Man was hand&s;ome; but to be &s;ure I &s;hall never think him &s;o any more now; for hand&s;ome is that' hand&s;ome does. A Beggar Wench!&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Stop thy Torrent of Impertinence, 'cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> and &s;ee whether my Father wants me at Breakfa&s;t.'</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> then flung out of the Room, mutter|ing much to her&s;elf&mdash;of which&mdash;'Many come up, I a&s;&s;ure you,' was all that could be plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Whether Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> really de&s;erved that Su&s;pi|cion, of which her Mi&s;tre&s;s gave her a Hint, is a Matter which we cannot in dulge our Reader's Curio&s;i|ty
<PB N="187" REF="202">
by re&s;olving. We will however make him amends, in di&s;clo&s;ing what pa&s;&s;ed in the Mind of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader will be plea&s;ed to recollect, that a &s;ecret Affection for Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tolen in|to the Bo&s;om of this young Lady. That it had there grown to a pretty great Height before &s;he her&s;elf had di&s;covered it. When &s;he fir&s;t began to perceive is Symptoms, the Sen&s;ations were &s;o &s;weet and plea&s;ing, that &s;he had not Re&s;olution &s;ufficient to check or repel them; and thus &s;he went on cheri&s;h|ing a Pa&s;&s;ion of which &s;he never once con&s;idered the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This Incident relating to <HI>Molly,</HI> fir&s;t opened her Eyes. She now fir&s;t perceived the Weakne&s;s of which &s;he had been guilty; and though it cau&s;ed the utmo&s;t Perturbation in her Mind, yet it had the Ef|fect of other nau&s;eous Phy&s;ic, and for the Time ex|pelled her Di&s;temper. Its Operation indeed was mo&s;t wonderfully quick; and in the &s;hort Interval, while her Maid was ab&s;ent, &s;o entirely removed all Symp|toms, that when Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> returned with a Sum|mons from her Father, &s;he was become perfectly ea&s;y, and had brought her&s;elf to a thorough Indiffe|rence for Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind do in almo&s;t every Par|ticular imitate tho&s;e of the Body. For which Rea|&s;on, we hope, That learned Faculty, for whom we have &s;o profound a Re&s;pect, will pardon us the violent Hands we have been nece&s;&s;itated to lay on &s;everal Words and Phra&s;es, which of Right belong to them, and without which our De&s;criptions mu&s;t have been often unintelligible.</P>
<P>Now there is no one Circum&s;tance in which the Di&s;tempers of the Mind bear a more exact Analogy to tho&s;e which are called Bodily, than that Aptne&s;s which both have to a Relap&s;e. This is plain, in the violent Di&s;ea&s;es of Ambition and Avarice. I have known Ambition, when cured at Court by frequent
<PB N="188" REF="203">
Di&s;appointments, (which are the only Phy&s;ic for it, to break out again in a Conte&s;t of Foreman of the Grand Jury at an A&s;&s;izes; and have heard of a Man who had &s;o far conquered Avarice, as to give away many a Sixpence, that comforted him&s;elf, at la&s;t, on his Death-bed, by making a crafty and advan|tageous Bargain concerning his en&s;uing Funeral, with an Undertaker who had married his only Child.</P>
<P>In the Affair of Love, which out of &s;trict Confor|mity with the Stoic Philo&s;ophy, we &s;hall here treat as a Di&s;ea&s;e, this Pronene&s;s to relap&s;e is no le&s;s con|&s;picuous. Thus it happened to poor <HI>Sophia;</HI> upon whom, the very next Time &s;he &s;aw young <HI>Jones,</HI> all the former Symptoms returned, and from that Time cold and hot Fits alternately &s;eized her Heart.</P>
<P>The Situation of this young Lady was very diffe|rent from what it had ever been before. That Pa&s;|&s;ion, which had formerly been &s;o exqui&s;itely delicious, became now a Scorpion in her Bo&s;om. She re&s;i&s;ted it therefore with her utmo&s;t Force, and &s;ummoned every Argument her Rea&s;on (which was &s;urprizingly &s;trong for her Age) could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;ubdue and ex|pel it. In this &s;he &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that &s;he began to hope from Time and Ab&s;ence a perfect Cure. She re&s;olved therefore to avoid <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible; for which Purpo&s;e &s;he began to conceive a De&s;ign of vi&s;iting her Aunt, to which &s;he made no Doubt of obtaining her Father's Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>But Fortune who had other De&s;igns in her Head, put an immediate Stop to any &s;uch Proceeding, by in|troducing an Accident, which will be related in the next Chapter.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A dreadful Accident which befel</HI> Sophia. <HI>The gal|lant Behaviour of</HI> Jones, <HI>and the more dreadful Con|&s;equence of that Behaviour to the young Lady; with a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion in Favour of the Female Sex.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> grew every Day fonder and fonder of <HI>Sophia,</HI> in&s;omuch that his beloved Dogs them&s;elves almo&s;t gave Place to her in his Affections; but as he could not prevail on him&s;elf to abandon the&s;e, he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their Company, together with that of his Daughter, by in&s;i&s;ting on her riding a hunting with him.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> to whom her Father's Word was a Law, readily complied with his De&s;ires, though &s;he had not the lea&s;t Delight in a Sport, which was of too rough and ma&s;culine a Nature to &s;uit with her Di&s;po|&s;ition. She had, however, another Motive, be&s;ide her Obedience, to accompany the old Gentleman in the Chace; for by her Pre&s;ence &s;he hoped in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to re&s;train his Impetuo&s;ity, and to prevent him from &s;o frequently expo&s;ing his Neck to the ut|mo&s;t Hazard.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t Objection was that which would have formerly been an Inducement to her, namely, the frequent Meeting with young <HI>Jones,</HI> whom &s;he had determined to avoid; but as the End of the hunt|ing Sea&s;on now approached, &s;he hoped, by a &s;hort Ab&s;ence with her Aunt, to rea&s;on her&s;elf entirely out of her unfortunate Pa&s;&s;ion; and had not any Doubt of being able to meet him in the Field the &s;ub&s;equent Sea&s;on without the lea&s;t Danger.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Day of her Hunting, as &s;he was returning from the Cha&s;e, and was arrived within a little Di&s;tance from Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Hou&s;e, her Hor&s;e, who&s;e mettle&s;ome Spirit required a better Rider, fell &s;uddenly to prancing and capering, in &s;uch a Manner, that &s;he was in the mo&s;t imminent Peril of falling. <HI>Tom</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="205">
<HI>Jones,</HI> who was at a little Di&s;tance behind, &s;aw this and immediately galloped up to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. As &s;oon as he came up, he immediately leapt from his own Hor&s;e, and caught hold of her's by the Bridle. The unruly Bea&s;t pre&s;ently reared him&s;elf an End on his hind Legs, and threw his Burthen from his Back, and <HI>Jones</HI> caught her in his Arms.</P>
<P>She was &s;o affected with the Fright, that &s;he was not immediately able to &s;atisfy <HI>Jones,</HI> who was very &s;ollicitous to know whether &s;he had received any Hurt. She &s;oon after, however, recovered her Spi|rits, a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was &s;afe, and thanked him for the Care he had taken of her. <HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered, 'If I have pre&s;erved you, Madam, I am &s;ufficiently re|paid; for I promi&s;e you, I would have &s;ecured you from the lea&s;t Harm, at the Expence of a much greater Misfortune to my&s;elf, than I have &s;uffered on this Occa&s;ion.'</P>
<P>'What Misfortune,' replied <HI>Sophia,</HI> eagerly, 'I hope you have come to no Mi&s;chief?'</P>
<P>'Be not concerned, Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'Heaven be prai&s;ed, you have e&s;caped &s;o well, con|&s;idering the Danger you was in. If I have broke my Arm, I con&s;ider it as a Trifle, in Compari&s;on of what I feared upon your Account.'</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then &s;creamed out, 'Broke your Arm! Heaven forbid.'</P>
<P>'I am afraid I have, Madam,' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> 'but I beg you will &s;uffer me fir&s;t to take Care of you. I have a Right-hand yet at your Service, to help you into the next Field, where we have but a very lit|tle Walk to your Father's Hou&s;e.'</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> &s;eeing his left Arm dangling by his Side, while he was u&s;ing the other to lead her, no longer doubted of the Truth. She now grew much paler than her Fears for her&s;elf had made her before. All her Limbs were &s;eized with a Trembling, in&s;omuch that <HI>Jones</HI> could &s;carce &s;upport her; and as her Thoughts
<PB N="191" REF="206">
were in no le&s;s Agitation, &s;he could not refrain from giving <HI>Jones</HI> a Look &s;o full of Tenderne&s;s, that it al|mo&s;t argued a &s;tronger Sen&s;ation in her Mind, than even Gratitude and Pity united can rai&s;e in the gentle&s;t female Bo&s;om, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a third more powerful Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who was advanced at &s;ome Di&s;tance when this Accident happened, was now returned, as were the re&s;t of the Hor&s;emen. <HI>Sophia</HI> immediately acquainted them with what had befallen <HI>Jones,</HI> and begged them to take Care of him. Upon which, <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who had been much alarmed by meeting his Daughter's Hor&s;e without its Rider, and was now o|verjoyed to find her unhurt, cried out, 'I am glad it is no wor&s;e, if <HI>Tom</HI> hath broken his Arm, we will get a Joiner to mend un again.'</P>
<P>The Squire alighted from his Hor&s;e, and proceeded to his Hou&s;e on Foot, with his Daughter and <HI>Jones.</HI> An impartial Spectator, who had met them on the Way, would, on viewing their &s;everal Countenances, have concluded <HI>Sophia</HI> alone to have been the Object of Compa&s;&s;ion: For as to <HI>Jones,</HI> he exulted in having probably &s;aved the Life of the young Lady, at the Price only of a broken Bone; and Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> though he was not unconcerned at the Accident which had befallen <HI>Jones,</HI> was however, delighted in a much higher Degree with the fortunate e&s;cape of his Daugh|ter.</P>
<P>The Genero&s;ity of <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Temper con&s;trued this Behaviour of <HI>Jones</HI> into great Bravery; and it made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on her Heart: For certain it is, that there is no one Quality which &s;o generally recom|mends Men to Women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common Opinion, from that natural Ti|midity of the Sex; which is, &s;ays Mr. <HI>O&s;borne,</HI> &s;o great,' that a Woman is the mo&s;t cowardly of all 'the Creatures God ever made.' A Sentiment more remarkable for its Bluntne&s;s, than for its Truth. <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="207">
in his Politics, doth them, I believe, more Ju&s;|tice, when he &s;ays, <Q>'The Mode&s;ty and Fortitude of Men differ from tho&s;e Virtues in Women; for the Fortitude which becomes a Woman, would be Cowardice in a Man; and the Mode&s;ty which be|comes a Man, would be Pertne&s;s in a Woman.'</Q> Nor is there, perhaps, more of Truth in the Opinion of tho&s;e who derive the Partiality which Women are inclined to &s;hew to the Brave, from this Exce&s;s of their Fear. Mr. <HI>Bayle</HI> (I think, in his Article of <HI>Helen)</HI> imputes this, and with greater Probability, to their violent Love of Glory; for the Truth of which, we have the Authority of him, who, of all others, &s;aw farthe&s;t into human Nature; and who introduces the Heroine of his Ody&s;&s;ey, the great Pattern of ma|trimonal Love and Con&s;tancy, a&s;&s;igning the glory of her Hu&s;band as the only Source of her Affections to|wards him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader will not find this in the Poem: For the Sentiment is entirely left out in the Tran&s;lation.</NOTE></P>
<P>However this be, certain it is that the Accident operated very &s;trongly on <HI>Saphia;</HI> and, indeed, after much Enquiry into the Matter, I am inclined to be|lieve, that at this very Time, the charming <HI>Sophia</HI> made no le&s;s Impre&s;&s;ion on the Heart of <HI>Jones;</HI> to &s;ay Truth, he had for &s;ome Time become &s;en&s;ible of the irre&s;tible Power of her Charms.</P>

<P>WHEN they arrived in Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Hall, <HI>So|phia,</HI> who had totter'd along with much Dif|ficulty, &s;unk down in a Chair; but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hart&s;horn and Water, &s;he was prevented from fainting away, and had pretty well recovered her Spirits, when the Surgeon, who was &s;ent for to <HI>Jones,</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="208">
appeared. Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who imputed the&s;e Symp|toms in his Daughter to her Fall, advi&s;ed her to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ently blooded by way of Prevention. In this Opinion he was &s;econded by the Surgeon, who gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o many Rea&s;ons for bleeding, and quoted &s;o many Ca&s;es where Per&s;ons had mi&s;carried for want of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Squire became very importunate, and indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;i&s;ted peremtorily that his Daughter &s;hould be blooded.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> &s;oon yielded to the Commands of her Fa|ther, though entirely contrary to her own Inclinations: For &s;he &s;u&s;pected, I believe, le&s;s Danger from the Fright, than either the Squire or the Surgeon. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hen &s;tretched out her beautiful Arm, and the Opera|tor began to prepare for his Work.</P>
<P>While the Servants were bu&s;ied in providing Ma|terials; the Surgeon, who imputed the Backwardne&s;s which had appeared in <HI>Sophia</HI> to her Fears, began to comfort her with A&s;&s;urances that there was not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t Danger; for no Accident, he &s;aid, could ever happen in Bleeding, but from the mon&s;trous Igno|rance of Pretenders to Surgery, which he pretty plainly in&s;inuated was not at pre&s;ent to be apprehended. <HI>Sophia</HI> declared &s;he was not under the lea&s;t Apprehen|&s;ion; adding, if you open an Artery, I promi&s;e you I'll forgive you; 'Will you,' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'D&mdash;n me, if I will; if he does the lea&s;t Mi&s;chief, d&mdash;n me, if I don't ha' the Heart's Blood o'un out.' The Surgeon a&s;&s;ented to bleed her upon the&s;e Con|ditions, and then proceeded to his Operation, which he performed with as much Dexterity as he had pro|mi&s;ed; and as much Quickne&s;s: For he took but lit|tle Blood from her, &s;aying, it was much &s;afer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at once.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> when her Arm was bound up, retired: For &s;he was not willing (nor was it, perhaps, &s;trictly de|cent) to be pre&s;ent at the Operation on <HI>Jones.</HI> In|deed
<PB N="194" REF="209">
one Objection which &s;he had to Bleeding, (tho &s;he did not make it) was the Delay which it would occa&s;ion to dre&s;&s;ing the broken Bone. For <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> when <HI>Sophia</HI> was concerned, had no Con&s;ideration but for her; and as for <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf, he '&s;at like Patience on a Monument &s;miling at Grief.'

</ARGUMENT>
<P>PEradventure there may be no Parts in this prodigi|ous Work which will give the Reader le&s;s Plea|&s;ure in the peru&s;ing, than tho&s;e which have given the Author the greate&s;t Pains in compo&s;ing. Among the&s;e probably may be reckoned tho&s;e initial E&s;&s;ays which we have perfixed to the hi&s;torical Matter con|tained in every Book; and which we have deter|mined to be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to this kind of Writ|ing, of which we have &s;et our&s;elves at the Head.</P>
<P>For this our Determination we do not hold our|&s;elves &s;trictly bound to a&s;&s;ign any Rea&s;on; it being a|bundantly &s;ufficient that we have laid it down as a Rule nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in all Pro&s;ai-comi-epic Writ|ing. Who ever demanded the Rea&s;ons of that nice
<PB N="201" REF="216">
Unity of Time or Place which is now e&s;tabli&s;hed to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to dramatick Poetry? What Critic hath been ever a&s;ked why a Play may not contain two Days as well as one, or why the Audience (provided they travel like Electors, without any Expence) may not be wafted Fifty Miles as well as five! Hath any Commentator well accounted for the Limitation which an antient Critic had &s;et to the Drama, which he will have contain neither more nor le&s;s than five Acts; or hath any one living attempted to explain, what the modern Judges of our Theatres mean by that Word <HI>low;</HI> by which they have happily &s;ucceeded in bani&s;hing all Humour from the Stage, and have made the Theatre as dull as a Drawing-Room? Upon all the&s;e Occa&s;ions, the World &s;eemed to have embraced a Maxim of our Law, viz. <HI>Cuicun&abque; in Arte &s;ua perito credendum e&s;t:</HI> For it &s;eems, perhaps, difficult to con|ceive that any one &s;hould have enough of Impudence, to lay down dogmatical Rules in any Art or Science without the lea&s;t Foundation. In &s;uch Ca&s;es, there|fore, we are apt to conclude there are &s;ound and good Rea&s;ons at the Bottom, tho' we are unfortunately not able to &s;ee &s;o far.</P>
<P>Now, in Reality, the World have paid too great a Compliment to Critics, and have imagined them Men of much greater Profundity than they really are. From this Complai&s;ance, the Critics have been em|boldened to a&s;&s;ume a Dictatorial Power, and have &s;o far &s;ucceeded that they are now become the Ma&s;ters, and have the A&s;&s;urance to give Laws to tho&s;e Authors, from who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors they originally received them.</P>
<P>The Critrc, rightly con&s;idered, is no more than the Clerk, who&s;e Office is to tran&s;cribe the Rules and Laws laid down by tho&s;e great Judges, who&s;e va&s;t Strength of Genius hath placed them in the Light of Legi&s;lators in the &s;everal Sciences over which
<PB N="202" REF="217">
they pre&s;ided. This Office was all which the Critics of old a&s;pired to, nor did they ever dare to advance a Sentence, without &s;upporting it by the Authority of the Judge from whence it was borrowed.</P>
<P>But in Proce&s;s of Time, and in Ages of Ignorance, the Clerk began to invade the Power and a&s;&s;ume the Dignity of his Ma&s;ter. The Laws of Writing were no longer founded on the Practice of the Author, but on the Dictates of the Critic. The Clerk became the Legi&s;lator, and tho&s;e very peremptorily gave Laws, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was, at fir&s;t, only to tran|&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>Hence aro&s;e an obvious, and, perhaps, an unavoid|able Error: For the&s;e Critics being Men of &s;hal|low Capacities, very ea&s;ily mi&s;took mere Form for Sub&s;tance. They acted as a Judge would, who &s;hould adhere to the lifele&s;s Letter of Law, and reject the Spirit. Little Circum&s;tances which were, per|haps, accidental in a great Author, were, by the&s;e Critics, con&s;idered to con&s;titute his chief Merit, and tran&s;mitted as E&s;&s;entials to be ob&s;erved by all his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors. To the&s;e Encroachments, Time and Ig|norance, the two great Supporters of Impo&s;ture, gave Authority; and thus, many Rules for good Writing have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, which have not the lea&s;t Foundation in Truth or Nature; and which com|monly &s;erve for no other Purpo&s;e than to crub and re&s;train Genius, in the &s;ame Manner; as it would have re&s;trained the Dancing-ma&s;ter, had the many excellent Treati&s;es on that Art, laid it down as an e&s;&s;ential Rule, that every Man mu&s;t dance in Chains.</P>
<P>To avoid, therefore, all Imputation of laying down a Rule for Po&s;terity, founded only on the Au|thority of <HI>ip&s;e dixit;</HI> for which, to &s;ay the Truth, we have not the profounde&s;t Veneration; we &s;hall here wave the Privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay before the Reader, the Rea&s;ons which have induced us, to inter&s;per&s;e the&s;e &s;everal digre&s;&s;ive E&s;&s;ays, in the Cour&s;e of this Work.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="218">
And here we &s;hall of Nece&s;&s;ity be led to open a new Vein of Knowledge, which, if it hath been di&s;|covered, hath not, to our Rememberance, been wrought on by any antient or modern Writer. This Vein is no other than that of Contra&s;t, which runs through all the Works of the Creation, and may pro|bably have a large Share in con&s;tituting in us the Idea of all Beauty, as well natural as artificial: For what demon&s;trates the Beauty and Excellence of any thing, but its Rever&s;e? Thus the Beauty of Day, and that of Summer, is &s;et off by the Horrors of Night and Winter. And I believe, if it was po&s;&s;ible for a Man to have &s;een only the two former, he would have a very imperfect Idea of their Beauty.</P>
<P>But to avoid too &s;erious an Air: Can it be doubt|ed, but that the fine&s;t Woman in the World would lo&s;e all Benefit of her Charms, in the Eye of a Man who had never &s;een one of another Ca&s;t? The La|dies them&s;elves &s;eem &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that they are all indu&s;trious to procure Foils; nay, they will be|come Foils to them&s;elves; for I have ob&s;erved, (at <HI>Bath</HI> particularly,) that they endeavour to appear as ugly as po&s;&s;ible in the Morning, in order to &s;et off that Beauty which they intend to &s;hew you in the Evening.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Arti&s;ts have this Secret in Practice, tho' &s;ome, perhaps, have not much &s;tudied the Theory. The Jeweller knows that the fine&s;t Brilliant requires a Foil; and the Painter, by the Contra&s;t of his Figures, of|ten acquires great Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>A great Genius among us, will illu&s;trate this Mat|ter fully. I cannot, indeed, range him under any general Head of common Arti&s;ts, as he hath a Title to be placed among tho&s;e</P>
<Q><L><HI>Inventas, qui vitam excoluere per Artes.</HI></L>
<L>Who by invented Arts have Life improv'd.</L></Q>
<P>I mean here the Inventor of that mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Entertainment, called the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pantomime.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="219">
This Entertainment con&s;i&s;ted of two Parts, which the Inventor di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Names of <HI>the Se|rious</HI> and the <HI>Comic.</HI> The Serious exhibited a certain Number of Heathen Gods and Heroes, who were certainly the wor&s;t and dulle&s;t Company into which an Audience was ever introduced; and (which was a Secret known to few) were actually intended &s;o to be, in order to contra&s;t the <HI>Comic</HI> Part of the Enter|tainment, and to di&s;play the Tricks of Harlequin to the better Advantage.</P>
<P>This was, perhaps, no very civil U&s;e of &s;uch Per|&s;onages; but the Contrivance was neverthele&s;s inge|nious enough, and had its Effect. And this will now plainly appear, if in&s;tead of <HI>Serious</HI> and <HI>Comic,</HI> we &s;upply the Words <HI>Duller</HI> and <HI>Dulle&s;t;</HI> for the <HI>Comic</HI> was certainly duller than any thing before &s;hewn on the Stage, and could only be &s;et off by that &s;uperla|tive Degree of Dulne&s;s, which compo&s;ed the Serious. So intolerably &s;erious, indeed, were the&s;e Gods and Heroes, that Harlequin (tho' the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman of that Name is not at all related to the <HI>French</HI> Fami|ly, for he is of a much more &s;erious Di&s;po&s;ition) was always welcome on the Stage, as he relieved the Audience from wor&s;e Company.</P>
<P>Judicious Writers have always practi&s;ed this Art of Contra&s;t, with great Succe&s;s. I have been &s;urprized that <HI>Horace</HI> &s;hould cavil at this Art in <HI>Homer;</HI> but indeed he contradicts him&s;elf in the very next Line.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat</HI> Homerus,</L>

<L>I grieve if e'er great <HI>Homer</HI> chance to &s;leep,</L>
<L>Yet Slumbers on long Works have right to creep.</L></Q>
<P>For we are not here to under&s;tand, as, perhaps, &s;ome have, that an Author actually falls a&s;leep while he is writing. It is true that Readers are too apt to be &s;o overtaken; but if the Work was as long as any of <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> the Author him&s;elf is too well enter|tained
<PB N="205" REF="220">
to be &s;ubject to the lea&s;t Drow&s;ine&s;s. He is, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob&s;erves,</P>
<Q>Sleeple&s;s him&s;elf to give his Readers Sleep.</Q>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, the&s;e &s;oporific Parts are &s;o many Scenes of <HI>Serious</HI> artfully interwoven, in order to con|tra&s;t and &s;et off the re&s;t; and this is the true Meaning of a late facetious Writer, who told the Public, that whenever he was dull, they might be a&s;&s;ured there was a De&s;ign in it.</P>
<P>In this Light then, or rather in this Darkne&s;s, I would have the Reader to con&s;ider the&s;e initial E&s;&s;ays. And after this Warning, if he &s;hall be of Opinion, that he can find enough of Serious in other Parts of this hi&s;tory, he may pa&s;s over the&s;e, in which we profe&s;s to be laboriou&s;ly dull, and begin the following Books, at the &s;econd Chapter.</P>

<P><HI>TOM JONES</HI> had many Vi&s;itors during his Confinement, tho' &s;ome, perhaps, were not ve|ry agreeable to him. Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;aw him almo&s;t every Day; but tho' he pitied <HI>Tom'</HI>s Sufferings, and greatly approved the gallant Behaviour which had occa&s;ioned them, yet he thought this was a favoura|ble Opportunity to bring him to a &s;ober Sen&s;e of his indi&s;creet Conduct; and that whol&s;ome Advice for that Purpo&s;e, could never be applied at a more proper Sea&s;on than at the pre&s;ent; when the Mind was &s;of|tened by Pain and Sickne&s;s, and alarmed by Danger; and when its Attention was unembarra&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e turbulent Pa&s;&s;ions, which engage us in the Pur&s;uit of Plea&s;ure.</P>

totally at Ea&s;e, he took Occa&s;ian to remind him of his former Mi&s;carriages, but in the milde&s;t and tender|e&s;t Manner, and only in order to introduce the Cau|tion, which he pre&s;cribed for his future Behaviour; 'on which alone, 'he a&s;&s;ured him, 'would depend his own Felicity, and the Kindne&s;s which he might yet promi&s;e him&s;elf to receive at the Hands of his Father by Adoption unle&s;s he &s;hould hereafter for|feit his Good Opinion: For as to what had pa&s;t,' he &s;aid, 'it &s;hould be all forgotten and forgiven. He, therefore, advi&s;ed him to make a good U&s;e of this Accident, that &s;o in the End it might prove a Vi&s;itation for his own Good.'</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> was likewi&s;e pretty a&s;&s;iduous in his Vi|&s;its; and he too con&s;idered a &s;ick Bed to be a conve|nient Scene for Lectures. His Stile, however, was more &s;evere than Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s: He told his Pupil, 'that he ought to look on his broken Limb as a Judgment from Heaven on his Sins. That it would become him to be daily on his Knees, pouring forth Thank&s;givings that he had broken his Arm only, and not his Neck; which latter,' he &s;aid, 'was very probably re&s;erved for &s;ome future Occa|&s;ion, and that perhaps, not very remote. For his Part,' he &s;aid, 'he had often wondered &s;ome Judg|ment had not overtaken him before; but it might be perceived by this, that divine Puni&s;hments, tho' &s;low, are always &s;ure.' Hence likewi&s;e he advi&s;ed him 'to fore&s;ee, with equal Certainty, the greater Evils which 'vere yet behind, and which were as &s;ure as this, of overtaking him in his State of Reprobacy. The&s;e are,' &s;aid he, 'to be averted only by &s;uch a thorough and &s;incere Repentance, as is not to be expected or hoped for, from one &s;o abandoned in his Youth, and who&s;e Mind, I am afraid, is totally corrupted. It is my Duty, however, to exhort you to this Repen|tance, tho' I too well know all Exhortations will be vain and fruitle&s;s. But <HI>liberavi Animam meam.</HI> I can

<P><HI>Square</HI> talked in a very different Strain, He &s;aid, '&s;uch Accidents as a Broken Bone were below the Con&s;ideration of a wi&s;e Man. That it was abun|dantly &s;ufficient to reconcile the Mind to any of the&s;e Mi&s;chances, to reflect that they are liable to befal the wi&s;e&s;t of Mankind, and are undoubtedly for the Good of the whole.' He &s;aid, 'it was a mere Abu&s;e of Words, to call tho&s;e Things Evils in which there was no moral Unfitne&s;s; that Pain, which was the wor&s;t Con&s;equence of &s;uch Accidents, was the mo&s;t contemptible thing in the World;' with more of the like Sentences, extracted out of the Second Book of <HI>Tully'</HI>s Tu&s;culan <HI>Que&s;tions,</HI> and from the Great Lord <HI>Shafte&s;bury.</HI> In pronouncing the&s;e he was one Day &s;o eager, that he unfortunately bit his Tongue; and in &s;uch a Manner, that it not only put an End to his Di&s;cour&s;e, but created much Emotion in him, and cau&s;ed him to mutter an Oath or two: But what was wor&s;t of all, this Accident gave <HI>Thwackum,</HI> who was pre&s;ent, and who held all &s;uch Doctrine to be heatheni&s;h and athei&s;tical, an Opportu|nity to clap a Judgment on his Back. Now this was done with &s;o malicious a Sneer, that it totally unhinged (if I my &s;o &s;ay) the Temper of the Philo&s;opher, which the Bite of his Tongue had &s;omewhat ruffled; and he was &s;o di&s;abled from venting his Wrath at his Lips, he had po&s;&s;ibly found a more violent Method of re|venging him&s;elf, had not the Surgeon, who was then luckily in the Room, contrary to his own Intere&s;t, interpo&s;ed, and pre&s;erved the Peace.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> vi&s;ited his Friend <HI>Jones</HI> but &s;eldom, and never alone. This worthy young Man, however, profe&s;&s;ed much Regard for him, and as great Con|cern at his Misfortune; but cautiou&s;ly avoided any
<PB N="208" REF="223">
Intimacy, le&s;t, as he frequently hinted, it might con|taminate the Sobriety of his own Character: For which Purpo&s;e, he had con&s;tantly in his Month that Proverb in which <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;peaks again&s;t Evil Commu|nication. Not that he was &s;o bitter as <HI>Thwackum</HI> for he always expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Hopes of <HI>Tom'</HI>s Refor|mation; 'which,' he &s;aid, 'the unparallelled Good|ne&s;s &s;hewn by his Uncle on this Occa&s;ion, mu&s;t certainly effect, in one not ab&s;olutely abandoned;' but concluded, 'if Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> ever offends hereafter I &s;hall not be able to &s;ay a Syllable in his Favour.'</P>
<P>As to Squire <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> he was &s;eldom out of the Sick Room; unle&s;s when he was engaged either in the Field, or over his Bottle. Nay, he would &s;ome|times retire hither to take his Beer, and it was not without Difficulty, that he was prevented from forcing <HI>Jones</HI> to take his Beer too: For no Quack ever held his No&s;trum to be a more general <HI>Panacea,</HI> than he did this; which, he &s;aid, had more Virtues in it than was in all the Phy&s;ic in an Apothecary's Shop. He was, however, by much Entreaty, prevailed on to for|bear the Application of this Medicine; but from &s;e|renading his Patient every Morning with the Horn un|der his Window, it was impo&s;&s;ible to withhold him; nor did he ever lay a&s;ide that Hollow, with which he entered into all Companies, when he vi&s;ited <HI>Jones,</HI> without any Regard to the &s;ick Per&s;on's being at that Time either awake or a&s;leep.</P>
<P>This boi&s;terous Behaviour, as it meant no Harm, &s;o happily it effected none, and was abundantly com|pen&s;ated to <HI>Jones,</HI> as &s;oon as he was able to &s;it up, by the Company of <HI>Sophia,</HI> whom the Squire then brought to vi&s;it him; nor was it, indeed, long before <HI>Jones</HI> was able to attend her to the Harp&s;ichord, where &s;he would kindly conde&s;cend, for Hours together, to charm him with the mo&s;t delicious Mu&s;ic, unle&s;s when the Squire thought proper to interrupt her, by
<PB N="209" REF="224">
in&s;i&s;ting on <HI>Old Sir Simon,</HI> or &s;ome other of his fa|vourite Pieces.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the nice&s;t Guard which <HI>Sophia</HI> en|deavoured to &s;et on her Behaviour, &s;he could not avoid letting &s;ome Appearances now and then &s;lip forth: For Love may again be likened to a Di&s;ea&s;e in this, that when it is denied a Vent in one Part, it will cer|tainly break out in another. What her Lips there|fore concealed, her Eyes, her Blu&s;hes, and many little involuntary Actions, betrayed.</P>
<P>One Day when <HI>Sophia</HI> was playing on the Harp|&s;ichord, and <HI>Jones</HI> was attending, the Squire came into the Room, crying, 'There <HI>Tom,</HI> I have had a Battle for thee below Stairs with thick Par&s;on <HI>Thwackum.&mdash;</HI>He hath been telling <HI>Allworthy,</HI> before my Face, that the broken Bone was a Judgment upon thee. D&mdash;n it, &s;ays I, how can that be? Did not he come by it in Defence of a young Woman? A Judgment indeed! Pox, if he never doth any thing wor&s;e, he will go to Heaven &s;ooner than all the Par&s;ons in the Country. He hath more rea&s;on to glory in it, than to be a&s;hamed of it.' 'Indeed, Sir,' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I have no Rea&s;on for either; but if it pre&s;erved Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> I &s;hall al|ways think it the happie&s;t Accident of my Life.'&mdash;And to gu,' &s;aid the Squire, 'to zet <HI>Allworthy</HI> a|gain&s;t thee vor it.&mdash;D&mdash;n 'un, if the Par&s;on had unt had his Petticuoats on, I &s;hould ha lent un a Flick; for I love thee dearly, my Boy, and d&mdash;n me if if there is any thing in my Power which I won't do for thee. Sha't take thy Choice of all the Hor&s;es in my Stable to-morrow Morning, except only the <HI>Chevalier</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Slouch.' Jones</HI> thanked him, but declined accepting the Offer.&mdash;'Nay,' added the Squire, 'Shat ha the &s;orrel Mare that <HI>Sophy</HI> rode. She co&s;t me fifty Guineas, and comes &s;ix Years old this Gra&s;s.' If &s;he had co&s;t me a thou&s;and,' cries <HI>Jones</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately, 'I would have given her to the

'Dogs,' Pooh! Pooh!' an&s;wered <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'what be|cau&s;e &s;he broke thy Arm. Should&s;t forget and for|give. I thought had&s;t been more a Man than to bear Malice again&s;t a dumb Creature.'&mdash;Here <HI>So|phia</HI> interpo&s;ed, and put an End to the Conver&s;a|tion, by de&s;iring her Father's Leave to play to him; a Reque&s;t which he never refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Countenance of <HI>Sophia</HI> had undergone more than one Change during the foregoing Speeches; and probably &s;he imputed the pa&s;&s;ionate Re&s;entment which <HI>Jones</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Mare to a different Motive from that from which her Father had derived it. Her Spirits were at this Time in a vi&s;ible Flutter; and &s;he played &s;o intolerably ill, that had not <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;oon fallen a&s;leep, he mu&s;t have remarked it. <HI>Jones,</HI> however, who was &s;ufficiently awake, and was not without an Ear any more than without Eyes, made &s;ome Ob&s;ervations; which being joined to all which the Reader may remember to have pa&s;&s;ed formerly, gave him pretty &s;trong A&s;&s;urances, when he came to reflect on the whole, that all was not well in the ten|der Bo&s;om of <HI>Sophia.</HI> An Opinion which many young Gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely won|der at his not having been well confirmed in long ago. To confe&s;s the Truth, he had rather too much Diffidence in him&s;elf, and was not forward enough in &s;eeing the Advances of a young Lady; a Misfor|tune which can only be cured by that early Town E|ducation, which is at pre&s;ent &s;o generally in Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Thoughts had fully taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Jones,</HI> they occa&s;ioned a Perturbation in his Mind, which, in a Con&s;titution le&s;s pure and firm than his, might have been, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on, attended with very dangerous Con&s;equences. He was truly &s;en&s;i|ble of the great Worth of <HI>Sophia.</HI> He extremely lik|ed her Per&s;on, no le&s;s admired her Accompli&s;hments, and tenderly loved her Goodne&s;s. In Reality, as he had never once entertained any Thought of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="211" REF="226">
her, nor had ever given the lea&s;t voluntary Indulgence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o his Inclinations, he had a much &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ion for her than he him&s;elf was acquainted with. His Heart now brought forth the full Secret, at the &s;ame Time that it a&s;&s;ured him the adorable Object return|ed his Affection.</P>

<P><HI>Which all, who have no Heart, will think to contain much ado about nothing.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader will perhaps imagine, the Sen&s;a|tions which now aro&s;e in <HI>Jones</HI> to have been &s;o &s;weet and delicious, that they would rather tend to produce a cheerful Serenity in the Mind, than any of tho&s;e dangerous Effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, Sen&s;ations of this Kind, however delici|ous, are, at their fir&s;t Recognition, of a very tumul|tuous Nature, and have very little of the Opiate in them. They were, moreover, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, embittered with certain Circum&s;tances, which being mixed with &s;weeter Ingredients, tended altogether to compo&s;e a Draught that might be termed <HI>bitter-&s;weet;</HI> than which, as nothing can be more di&s;agreeable to the Palate, &s;o nothing, in the metaphorical Sen&s;e, can be &s;o injurious to the Mind.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, though he had &s;ufficient foundation to flatter him&s;elf on what he had ob&s;erved in <HI>Sophia,</HI> he was not yet free from Doubt of mi&s;con&s;truing Com|pa&s;&s;ion, or at be&s;t, E&s;teem, into a warmer Regard. He was far from a &s;anguine A&s;&s;urance that <HI>Sophia</HI> had any &s;uch Affection towards him, as might pro|mi&s;e his Inclinations that Harve&s;t, which, if they were encouraged and nur&s;ed, they would finally grow up to require. Be&s;ides, if he could hope to find no Bar to his Happine&s;s from the Daughter, he thought him&s;elf certain of meeting an effectual Bar in the Father; who, though he was a Country Squire
<PB N="212" REF="227">
in his Diver&s;ions, was perfectly a Man of the World in whatever regarded his Fortune; had the mo&s;t vio|lent Affection for this only Daughter, and had often &s;ignified, in his Cups, the Plea&s;ure he propo&s;ed in &s;eeing her married to one of the riche&s;t Men in the County. <HI>Jones</HI> was not &s;o vain and &s;en&s;ele&s;s a Cox|comb as to expect from any Regard which <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had profe&s;&s;ed for him, that he would ever be induced to lay a&s;ide the&s;e Views of advancing his Daughter. He well knew that Fortune is generally the principal if not the &s;ole Con&s;ideration, which operates on the be&s;t of Parents in the&s;e Matters: For Friend&s;hip makes us warmly e&s;pou&s;e the Intere&s;t of others; but is very cold to the Gratification of their Pa&s;&s;ions. Indeed, to feel the Happine&s;s which may re&s;ult from this, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ion our|&s;elves. As he had therefore no Hopes of obtaining her Father's Con&s;ent, &s;o he thought to endeavour to &s;ucceed without it, and by &s;uch Means to fru&s;trate the Great Point of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Life, was to make a very ill U&s;e of his Ho&s;pitality, and a very ungrateful Return to the many little Favours received (however roughly) at his Hands. If he &s;aw &s;uch a Con&s;equence with Horror and Di&s;dain, how much more was he &s;hocked with what regarded Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> to whom as he had more than filial Obligations, &s;o had he for him more than filial Piety. He knew the Nature of that good Man to be &s;o aver&s;e to any Ba&s;ene&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Treachery, that the lea&s;t Attempt of &s;uch a Kind would make the guilty Per&s;on for ever odious to his Eyes, and the Name of that Per&s;on a dete&s;table Sound in his Ears. The Appearance of &s;uch un&s;urmount|able Difficulties was &s;ufficient to have in&s;pired him with De&s;pair, however ardent his Wi&s;hes had been but even the&s;e were controlled by Compa&s;&s;ion for another Woman. The Idea of lovely <HI>Molly</HI> now in|truded it&s;elf before him. He had &s;worn eternal Con|&s;tancy in her Arms, and &s;he had as often vowed ne|ver
<PB N="213" REF="228">
to outlive his de&s;erting her. He now &s;aw her in all the mo&s;t &s;hocking Po&s;tures of Death; nay, he con&s;idered all the Mi&s;eries of Pro&s;titution to which &s;he would be liable, and of which he would be doubly the Occa&s;ion; fir&s;t by &s;educing, and then by de&s;erting her; for he well knew the Hatred which all her Neighbours, and even her own Si&s;ters, bore her, and ready they would all be to tear her to Pieces. In|deed he had expo&s;ed her to more Envy than Shame, or rather to the latter by Means of the former: For many Women abu&s;ed her for being a Whore, while they envied her her Lover and Finery, and would have been them&s;elves glad to have purcha&s;ed the&s;e at the &s;ame Rate. The Ruin, therefore, of the poor Girl mu&s;t, he fore&s;aw, unavoidably attend his de&s;erting her; and this thought &s;tung him to the Soul. Pover|ty and Di&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed to him to give none a Right of aggravating tho&s;e Misfortunes. The Meanne&s;s of her Condition did not repre&s;ent her Mi&s;ery as of little Con&s;equence in his Eyes, nor did it appear to ju&s;tify, or even to palliate, his Guilt, in bringing that Mi&s;e|ry upon her. But why do I mention Ju&s;tification; his own Heart would not &s;uffer him to de&s;troy a human Creature, who, he thought, loved him, and had to that Love &s;acrificed her Innocence. His own good Heart pleaded her Cau&s;e; not as a cold venal Advocate; but as one intere&s;ted in the Event, and which mu&s;t it&s;elf deeply &s;hare in all the Agonies its Owner brought on another.</P>
<P>When this cunning Advocate had &s;ufficiently rai&s;|ed the Pity of <HI>Jones,</HI> by painting poor <HI>Molly</HI> in all the Circum&s;tances of Wretchedne&s;s; it artfuly called in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of another Pa&s;&s;ion, and repre&s;ented the Girl in all the amiable Colours of Youth, Health, and Beauty; as one greatly the Object of De&s;ire, and much the more &s;o, at lea&s;t to a good Mind, from be|ing, at the &s;ame time, the Object of Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="229">
A mid&s;t the&s;e Thoughts, poor <HI>Jones</HI> pa&s;&s;ed a long &s;leeple&s;s Night, and in the Morning the Re&s;ult of the whole was to abide by <HI>Molly,</HI> and to think no more of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>In this virtuous Re&s;olution he continued all the next Day till the Evening, cheri&s;hing the Idea of <HI>Molly,</HI> and driving <HI>Sophia</HI> from his Thoughts; but in the fatal Evening, a very trifling Accident &s;et all his Pa&s;&s;ions again on Float, worked &s;o total a Change in his Mind, that we think it decent to communicate it in a fre&s;h Chapter.</P>

<P>AMONG other Vi&s;itants, who paid their Com|pliments to the young Gentleman in his Con|finement, Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was one. The Reader, per|haps, when he reflects on &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which have formerly dropt from her, may conceive that &s;he her&s;elf had a very particular Affection for Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> but, in reality, it was no &s;uch thing. <HI>Tom</HI> was a hand&s;ome young Fellow; and for that Species of Men Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had &s;ome Regard; but this was per|fectly indi&s;criminate: For having been cro&s;&s;ed in the Love which &s;he bore a certain Nobleman's Footman, who had ba&s;ely de&s;erted her after a Promi&s;e of Mar|riage, &s;he had &s;o &s;ecurely kept together the broken Remains of her Heart, that no Man had ever &s;ince been able to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of any &s;ingle Fragment. She viewed all hand&s;ome Men with that equal Regard and Benevolence, which a &s;ober and virtuous Mind bears to all the Good.&mdash;She might, indeed, be called a Lover of Men, as <HI>Socrates</HI> was a Lover of Mankind, preferring one to another for corporeal, as he for mental Qualifications; but never carrying this Pre|ference
<PB N="215" REF="230">
&s;o far as to cau&s;e any Perturbation in the phi|lo&s;ophical Serenity of her Temper.</P>
<P>The Day after Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had had that Conflict with him&s;elf, which we have &s;een in the preceding Chapter, Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> came into his Room, and finding him alone, began in the following Manner: 'La, Sir, where do you think I have been? I war|rants you, you would not gue&s;s in fifty Years; but if you did gue&s;s, to be &s;ure, I mu&s;t not tell you neither,' 'Nay if it be &s;omething which you mu&s;t not tell me,' &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I &s;hall have the Curio&s;ity to enquire, and I know you will not be &s;o barbarous to refu&s;e me.' 'I don't know,' cries &s;he, 'why I &s;hould refu&s;e you neither, for that Matter; for to be &s;ure you won't mention it any more. And for that Matter, if you knew where I had been, unle&s;s you knew what I had been about, it would not &s;ignify much. Nay, I don't &s;ee why it &s;hould be kept a Secret, for my Part; for to be &s;ure &s;he is the be&s;t Lady in the World.' Upon this <HI>Jones</HI> be|gan to beg earne&s;tly to be let into this Secret, and faithfully promi&s;ed not to divulge it. She then pro|ceeded thus. 'Why you mu&s;t know, Sir, my young Lady &s;ent me to enquire after <HI>Molly Sea|grim,</HI> and to &s;ee whether the Wench wanted any thing; to be &s;ure, I did not care to go, methinks; but Servants mu&s;t do what they are ordered.&mdash;How could you undervalue your&s;elf &s;o, Mr. <HI>Jones?&mdash;</HI>So my Lady bid me go, and carry her &s;ome Linnen, and other Things.&mdash;She is too good. If &s;uch forward Sluts were &s;ent to <HI>Bridewell</HI> it would be better for them.

<P>She was playing one of her Father's favourite Tunes, and he was leaning on her Chair when the Muff fell over her Fingers, and put her out.

<P>BUT though this victorious Deity ea&s;ily expelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his avowed Enemies from the Heart of <HI>Jones,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> found it more difficult to &s;upplant the Garri&s;on whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> he him&s;elf had placed there. To lay a&s;ide all All+gory, the Concern for what mu&s;t become of po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Molly,</HI> greatly di&s;turbed and perplexed the Mind the worthy Youth. The &s;uperior Merit of <HI>Sophia</HI> totally ecclip&s;ed, or rather extingui&s;hed all the Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ties of the poor Girl; but compa&s;&s;ion in&s;tead of Con|tempt &s;ucceeded to Love.

He con&s;idered this poor
<PB N="219" REF="234">
as having &s;acrificed to him every Thing in her little Power; as having been at her own Expence the Ob|ject of his Plea&s;ure; as &s;ighing and langui&s;hing for him even at that very In&s;tant. Shall then, &s;ays he, my Recovery, for which &s;he hath &s;o ardently wi&s;h|ed; &s;hall my Pre&s;ence which &s;he hath &s;o eagerly ex|pected, in&s;tead of giving her that Joy with which &s;he hath flattered her&s;elf, ca&s;t her at once down into Mi&s;ery and De&s;pair? Can I be &s;uch a Villain? Here, when the Genius of poor <HI>Molly</HI> &s;eem'd triumphant, the Love of <HI>Sophia</HI> towards him, which now appear|ed no longer dubious, ru&s;hed upon his Mind, and bore away every Ob&s;tacle before it.</P>
<P>At length it occurred to him, that he might po&s;&s;ibly be able to make <HI>Molly</HI> amends another Way; name|ly, by giving her a Sum of Money. This never|thele&s;s, he almo&s;t de&s;paired of her accepting, when he recollected the frequent and vehement A&s;&s;urances he had received from her, that the World put in Ballance with him, would make her no amends for his Lo&s;s. However, her extreme Poverty, and chief|ly her egregious Vanity (&s;omewhat of which hath been already hinted to the Reader,) gave him &s;ome little Hope, that notwith&s;tanding all her avowed Tenderne&s;s, &s;he might in Time be brought to content her&s;elf with a Fortune &s;uperiour to her Expectation, and which might indulge her Vanity, by &s;etting her above all her Equals. He re&s;olved therefore, to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of making a Propo&s;al of this Kind.</P>
<P>One Day accordingly, when his Arm was &s;o well recovered, that he could walk ea&s;ily with it &s;lung in a Sa&s;h, he &s;tole forth, at a Sea&s;on when the Squire was engaged in his Field Exerci&s;es, and vi&s;ited his Fair one. Her Mother and Si&s;ters, whom he found caking their Tea, informed him fir&s;t that <HI>Molly</HI> was not at Home; but afterwards, the elder Si&s;ter ac|quainted him with a malicious Smile, that &s;he was
<PB N="220" REF="235">
above Stairs abed. <HI>Tom</HI> had no Objection to this Situation of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and immediately a&s;cended the Ladder which led towards her Bed-Chamber but when he came to the Top, he, to his great Sur|prize, found the Door fa&s;t; nor could he for &s;ome Time obtain any An&s;wer from within; for <HI>Molly,</HI> as &s;he her&s;elf afterwards informed him, was fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The Extremes of Grief and Joy have been remark|ed to produce very &s;imilar Effects; and when either of the&s;e ru&s;hes on us by Surprize, it is apt to create &s;uch a total Perturbation and Confu&s;ion, that we are often thereby deprived of the U&s;e of all our Faculties. It cannot therefore be wondered at, that the unex+pected Sight of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;hould &s;o &s;trongly operate on the Mind of <HI>Molly,</HI> and &s;hould overwhelm he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> with &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that for &s;ome Minutes &s;he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> unable to expre&s;s the great Raptures, with which the Reader will &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was affected on this Occa&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> As for <HI>Jones,</HI> he was &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> were enchanted by the Pre&s;ence of his beloved Object that he for a while forgot <HI>Sophia,</HI> and con&s;equently the principal Purpo&s;e of his Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>This, however, &s;oon recurred to his Memory and after the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports of their Meeting were over, he found Means by Degrees to introduce a Di&s;|cour&s;e on the fatal Con&s;equences which mu&s;t attend their Amour, if Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who had &s;trictly for bidden him ever &s;eeing her more, &s;hould di&s;cover that he &s;till carried on this Commerce. Such a Di&s;|covery, which his Enemies gave him Rea&s;on to thing would be unavoidable, mu&s;t, he &s;aid, end in his Ruin, and con&s;equently in hers. Since, therefore, their hard Fates had determined that they mu&s;t &s;eparate, he advi&s;ed her to bear it with Re&s;olution, and &s;wore he would never omit any Opportunity through the Cour&s;e of his Life, of &s;hewing her the Sincerity of his Af|fection, by providing for her in a Manner beyond her utmo&s;t Expectation, or even beyond her wi&s;hes
<PB N="221" REF="236">
if ever that &s;hould be in his Power; concluding, at la&s;t, that &s;he might &s;oon find &s;ome Man who would marry her, and who would make her much happier than &s;he could be by leading a di&s;reputable Life with him.</P>
<P><HI>Molly</HI> remained a few Moments in Silence, and then bur&s;ting into a Flood of Tears, &s;he began to up|braid him in the following Words. 'And is this your Love for me, to for&s;ake me in this Manner, now you have ruined me? How often, when I have told you that all Men are fal&s;e and Perjury alike, and grow tired of us as &s;oon as ever they have had their wicked Wills of us, how often have you &s;worn you would never for&s;ake me? And can you be &s;uch a Perjury Man after all? What &s;ignifies all the Riches in the World to me without you, now you have gained my Heart, &s;o you have&mdash;you have&mdash;? Why do you mention another Man to me? I can never love any other Man as long as I live. All other Men are nothing to me. If the greate&s;t Squire in all the Country would come a &s;uiting to me to|morrow, I would not give my Company to him. No, I &s;hall always hate and de&s;pi&s;e the whole Sex for your Sake&mdash;'</P>
<P>She was proceeding thus, when an Accident put a Stop to her Tongue, before it had run out half its Career. The Room, or rather Garret, in which <HI>Molly</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, being up one Pair of Stairs, that is to &s;ay, at the Top of the Hou&s;e, was of a &s;loping Figure, re&s;embling the great <HI>Delta</HI> of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader may, perhaps, form a better Idea of it, by being told, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tand upright any where but in the Middle. Now, as this Room wanted the Con|veniency of a Clo&s;et, <HI>Molly</HI> had, to &s;upply that De|fect, nailed up an old Rug again&s;t the Rafters of the Hou&s;e, which enclo&s;ed a little Hole where her be&s;t Apparel, &s;uch as the Remains of that Sack which we have formerly mentioned, &s;ome Caps, and other
<PB N="222" REF="237">
Things with which &s;he had lately provided her&s;elf, were hung up and &s;ecured from the Du&s;t.</P>
<P>This inclo&s;ed Place exactly fronted the Foot of the Bed, to which, indeed, the Rug hung &s;o near, that it &s;erved in a Manner, to &s;upply the Want of Cur|tains. Now, whether <HI>Molly</HI> in the Agonies of her Rage, pu&s;hed this Rug with her Feet; or, <HI>Jones</HI> might touch it; or whether the Pin or Nail gave way of its own Accord, I am not certain; but as <HI>Molly</HI> pronounced tho&s;e la&s;t Words, which are recorded a|bove, the wicked Rug got loo&s;e from its Fa&s;tning, and di&s;covered every thing hid behind it; where a|mong other female Uten&s;ils appeared&mdash;(with Shame I write it, and with Sorrow will it be read)&mdash;the Philo&s;opher <HI>Square,</HI> in a Po&s;ture (for the Place would not near admit of his &s;tanding upright) as ridiculous as can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived.</P>
<P>The Po&s;ture, indeed, in which he &s;tood, was not greatly unlike that of a Soldier who is tyed Neck and Heels; or rather re&s;embling the Attitude in which we often &s;ee Fellows in the public Streets of <HI>London,</HI> who are not &s;uffering but de&s;erving Puni&s;hment by &s;o &s;tand|ing. He had a Night-cap belonging to <HI>Molly</HI> on his Head, and his two large Eyes, the Moment the Rug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fell, &s;tared directly at <HI>Jones;</HI> &s;o that when the Idea of Philo&s;ophy was added to the Figure now di&s;covered, it would have been very difficult for any Spectator to have refrained from immoderate Laughter.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but the Surprize of the Reader will be here equal to that of <HI>Jones;</HI> as the Su&s;picions which mu&s;t ari&s;e from the Appearance of this wi&s;e and grave Man in &s;uch a Place, may &s;eem &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with that Character, which he hath, doubtle&s;s, maintained hitherto, in the Opinion of every one.</P>
<P>But to confe&s;s the Truth, this Incon&s;i&s;tency is ra|ther imaginary than real. Philo&s;ophers are compo&s;ed of Fle&s;h and Blood as well as other human Creatures;
<PB N="223" REF="238">
and however &s;ublimated and refined the Theory of the&s;e may be, a little practical Frailty is as incident to them as to other Mortals. It is, indeed, in The|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ry only and not in Practice, as we have before hint|ed, that con&s;i&s;ts the Difference: For though &s;uch great Beings think much better and more wi&s;ely, they always act exactly like other Men. They know ve|ry well how to &s;ubdue all Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;pi&s;e both Pain and Plea&s;ure; and this Know|ledge affords much delightful Contemplation, and is ea&s;ily acquired; but the Practice would be vexatious and trouble&s;ome; and, therefore, the &s;ame Wi&s;dom which teaches them to know this, teaches them to avoid carrying it into Execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Square</HI> happened to be at Church, on that <HI>Sunday</HI> when, as the Reader may be plea&s;ed to re|member, the Appearance of <HI>Molly</HI> in her Sack had cau&s;ed all this Di&s;turbance. Here he fir&s;t ob&s;erved her and was &s;o plea&s;ed with her Beauty, that he pre|vailed with the young Gentlemen to change their in|tended Ride that Evening, that he might pa&s;s by the Habitation of <HI>Molly,</HI> and, by that Means, might ob|tain a &s;econd Chance of &s;eeing her. This Rea&s;on, however, as he did not at that Time mention to any, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the Reader.</P>
<P>Among other Particulars which con&s;tituted the Un|fitne&s;s of Things in Mr. <HI>Square'</HI>s Opinion, Danger and Difficulty were two. The Difficulty, there|fore, which he apprehended there might be in cor|rupting this young Wench, and the Danger which would accrue to his Character on the Di&s;covery, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ach &s;trong Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives, that it is probable, he at fir&s;t intended to have contented him&s;elf with the plea&s;ing Ideas which the Sight of Beauty furni&s;hes us with. The&s;e the grave&s;t Men, after a full Meal of Medita|tion, often allow them&s;elves by Way of De&s;ert: For which Purpo&s;e, certain Books and Pictures find their
<PB N="224" REF="239">
Way into the mo&s;t private Rece&s;&s;es of their Study, and a certain liquori&s;h Part of natural Philo&s;ophy is often the principal Subject of their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But when the Philo&s;opher heard a Day or two af|terwards, that the Fortre&s;s of Virtue had already been &s;ubdued, he began to give a larger Scope to his De|&s;ires. His Appetite was not of that &s;queami&s;h Kind which cannot feed on a Dainty becau&s;e another had ta&s;ted it. In &s;hort, he liked the Girl the better for the Want of that Cha&s;tity, which, if &s;he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, mu&s;t have been a Bar to his Plea&s;ures; he pur|&s;ued, and obtained her.</P>
<P>The Reader will be mi&s;taken, if he thinks <HI>Molly</HI> gave <HI>Square</HI> the Preference to her younger Lover On the contrary, had &s;he been confined to the Choice of one only, <HI>Tom Jones</HI> would, undoubtedly, have been, of the two, the victorious Per&s;on. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> was it &s;olely the Con&s;ideration that two are better than one (tho' this had it's proper Weight) to which Mr. <HI>Square</HI> owed his Succe&s;s; the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Jones</HI> during his Confinement was an unlucky Circum&s;tance; and in that Interval, &s;ome well cho&s;en pre&s;ents from the Philo&s;opher &s;o &s;oftened and unguarded the Girl's Heart, that a favourable Opportunity became irre&s;i&s;ta|ble, and <HI>Square</HI> triumphed over the poor Remains of Virtue which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Bo&s;om of <HI>Molly.</HI></P>
<P>It was now about a Fortnight &s;ince this Conque&s;t, when <HI>Jones</HI> paid the above-mentioned Vi&s;it to his Mi&s;|tre&s;s, at a time when &s;he and <HI>Square</HI> were in Bed to|gether. This was the true Rea&s;on why the Mother denied her as we have &s;een; for as the old Woman-&s;hared in the Profits ari&s;ing from the Iniquity of her Daughter, &s;he encouraged and protected her in it to the utmo&s;t of her Power; but &s;uch was the Envy and Hatred which the elde&s;t Si&s;ter bore towards <HI>Molly,</HI> that, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had &s;ome Part of the Booty, &s;he would willingly have parted with this to ruin her Si&s;|ter, and &s;poil her Trade. Hence &s;he had acquainted
<PB N="225" REF="240">
<HI>Jones</HI> with her being above Stairs in Bed, in Hopes that he might have caught her in <HI>Square'</HI>s Arms. This, however, <HI>Molly</HI> found Means to prevent, as the Door was fa&s;tned; which gave her an Opportu|nity of conveying her Lover behind that Rug or Blan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et where he now was unhappily di&s;covered.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> no &s;ooner made his Appearance than <HI>Molly</HI> flung her&s;elf back in her Bed, cried out &s;he was un|done, and abandoned her&s;elf to De&s;pair. This poor Girl, who was yet but a Novice in her Bu&s;ine&s;s, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot arrived to that Perfection of A&s;&s;urance which helps off a Town Lady in any Extremity; and either prompts her with an Excu&s;e, or el&s;e in&s;pires her to brazen out the Matter with her Hu&s;band; who from Love of Quiet, or out of Fear of his Reputation, and &s;ometimes, perhaps, from Fear of the Gallant, who, like Mr. <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> in the Play, wears a Sword, is glad to &s;hut his Eyes, and contented to put his Horns in his Pocket: <HI>Molly,</HI> on the contrary, was &s;ilenced by this Evidence, and very fairly gave up a Cau&s;e which &s;he had hitherto with &s;o many Tears, and with &s;uch &s;olemn and vehement Prote&s;tations of the pure&s;t Love and Con&s;tancy, maintained.</P>
<P>As to the Gentleman behind the Arras, he was not in much le&s;s Con&s;ternation. He &s;tood for a while motionle&s;s, and &s;eemed equally at a Lo&s;s what to &s;ay, or whither to direct his Eyes. <HI>Jones,</HI> tho' perhaps, the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed of the three, fir&s;t found his Tongue; and, being immediately recovered from tho&s;e unea&s;y Sen&s;ations, which <HI>Molly</HI> by her upbraid|ings had occa&s;ioned, he bur&s;t into a loud Laughter, and then &s;aluting Mr. <HI>Square,</HI> advanced to take him by the Hand, and to relieve him from his Place of Confinement.</P>
<P><HI>Square,</HI> being now arrived in the Middle of the Room, in which Part only he could &s;tand upright, looked at <HI>Jones</HI> with a very grave Countenance, and
<PB N="226" REF="241">
&s;aid to him, 'Well, Sir, I &s;ee you enjoy this mighty Di&s;covery, and, I dare &s;wear, ta&s;te great Delight in the Thoughts of expo&s;ing me: but if you will con&s;ider the Matter fairly, you will find you are your&s;elf only to blame. I have done nothing for which that Part of the World which judges of Mat|ters by the Rule of Right will condemn me. Fit|ne&s;s is governed by the Nature of Things, and not by Cu&s;toms, Forms, or municipal Laws. No|thing is, indeed, unfit which is not unnatural.' 'Well rea&s;oned, old Boy,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones;</HI> 'but why do&s;t thou think I &s;hould de&s;ire to expo&s;e thee?

'Nay, Mr. <HI>Jones,'</HI> replied <HI>Square,</HI> 'I would not be thought to undervalue Reputation. Good Fame is a Species of the KALON, and it is by no Means fitting to neglect it. Be&s;ides to murder one's own Reputation, is a kind of Suicide, a dete&s;table odious Vice.

'Right!' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'what can be more innocent than the Indulgence of a natural Appetite? or what more laudable than the Propagation of our Species?' 'To be &s;erious with you,' an&s;wered <HI>Square,</HI> 'I profe&s;s they always appeared &s;o to me.' 'And yet,' &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'you was of a different Opinion when my Affair with this Girl was fir&s;t di&s;covered.' 'Why, I mu&s;t confe&s;s,' &s;ays <HI>Square,</HI> 'as the Matter was mi&s;repre&s;ented to me by that Par&s;on <HI>Thwakum,</HI> I might condemn the Corruption of Innocence. It

So &s;aying, he took a ha&s;ty Leave, and &s;lipping down the Ladder, retired with much Expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> was rejoyced to find this Adventure was likely to have no wor&s;e Conclu&s;ion; and as for <HI>Mol|ly,</HI> being recovered from her Confu&s;ion, &s;he began at fir&s;t to upbraid <HI>Square</HI> with having been the Oc|ca&s;ion of her Lo&s;s of <HI>Jones;</HI> but that Gentleman &s;oon found the Means of mitigating her Anger, part|ly by a &s;mall No&s;trum from his Pur&s;e, of wonder|ful and approved Efficacy in purging off the ill Hu|mours of the Mind, and in re&s;toring it to a good Temper.</P>
<P>She then poured forth a va&s;t Profu&s;ion of Ten|derne&s;s towards her new Lover; turned all &s;he had &s;aid to <HI>Jones,</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf into Ridicule, and vowed, tho' he had had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Per&s;on, that none but <HI>Square</HI> had ever been Ma&s;ter of her Heart.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>By comparing which with the former, the Reader may po&s;&s;ibly correct &s;ome Abu&s;e which he hath formerly been guilty of, in the Application of the Word</HI> LOVE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Infidelity of <HI>Molly,</HI> which <HI>Jones</HI> had now di&s;covered, would, perhaps, have vindicated a
<PB N="228" REF="243">
much greater Degree of Re&s;entment than he expre&s;&s;ed on the Occa&s;ion; and if he had abandoned her direct|ly from that Moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed him.</P>
<P>Certain, however, it is, that he &s;aw her in the Light of Compa&s;&s;ion; and tho' his Love to her was not of that Kind which could give him any great Unea&s;ine&s;s at her Incon&s;tancy, yet was he not a little &s;hocked on reflecting that he had him&s;elf originally corrupted her Innocence; for to this Corruption he imputed all the Vice, into which &s;he appeared now &s;o likely to plunge her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration gave him no little Unea&s;ine&s;s, till <HI>Betty,</HI> the elder Si&s;ter, was &s;o kind &s;ome time af|terwards entirely to cure him by a Hint, that one <HI>Will Barnes,</HI> and not him&s;elf, had been the fir&s;t Seducer of <HI>Molly;</HI> and that the little Child, which he had hitherto &s;o certainly concluded to be his own, might very probably have an equal Title at lea&s;t, to claim <HI>Barnes</HI> for its Father.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> eagerly pur&s;ued this Scent when he had fir&s;t received it; and in a very &s;hort Time was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured that the Girl had told him Truth, not only by the Confe&s;&s;ion of the Fellow, but, at la&s;t, by that of <HI>Molly</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This <HI>Will Barnes</HI> was a Country Gallant, and had acquired as many Trophies of this Kind as any En|&s;ign or Attorney's Clerk in the Kingdom. He had, indeed, reduced &s;everal Women to a State of utter Profligacy, had broke the Hearts of &s;ome, and had the Honour of occa&s;ioning the violent Death of one poor Girl, who had either drowned her&s;elf, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by him.</P>
<P>Among other of his Conque&s;ts, this Fellow had triumphed over the Heart of <HI>Betty Seagrim.</HI> He had made love to her long before <HI>Molly</HI> was grown to be a fit Object of that Pa&s;time; but had afterwards de|&s;erted her, and applied to her Si&s;ter, with whom he
<PB N="229" REF="244">
had almo&s;t immediate Succe&s;s. Now <HI>Will</HI> had, in reality, the &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Molly'</HI>s Affection, while <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Square</HI> were almo&s;t equally Sacrifices to her Intere&s;t, and to her Pride.</P>
<P>Hence had grown that implacable Hatred which we have before &s;een raging in the Mind of <HI>Betty;</HI> though we did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ign this Cau&s;e &s;oon|er, as Envy it&s;elf was alone adequate to all the Ef|fects we have mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was become perfectly ea&s;y by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Secret with Regard to <HI>Molly;</HI> but as to <HI>Sophia,</HI> he was far from being in a State of Tranquillity; nay, indeed, he was under the mo&s;t violent Perturbation: His Heart was now, if I may u&s;e the Metaphor, en|tirely evacuated, and <HI>Sophia</HI> took ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He loved her with an unbounded Pa&s;&s;ion, and plainly &s;aw the tender Sentiments &s;he had for him; yet could not this A&s;&s;urance le&s;&s;en his De&s;pair of ob|taining the Con&s;ent of her Father, nor the Horrors which attended his Pur&s;uit of her by any ba&s;e or treacherous Method.</P>
<P>The Injury which he mu&s;t thus do to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and the Concern which would accrue to Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy,</HI> were Circum&s;tances that tormented him all Day, and haunted him on his Pillow at Night. His Life was a con&s;tant Struggle between Honour and Incli|nation, which alternately triumphed over each other in his Mind. He often re&s;olved in the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Sophia,</HI> to leave her Father's Hou&s;e, and to &s;ee her no more; and as often, in her pre&s;ence, forgot all tho&s;e Re&s;olutions, and determined to pur&s;ue her at the Hazard of his Life, and at the Forfeiture of what was much dearer to him.</P>
<P>This Conflict began &s;oon to produce very &s;trong and vi&s;ible Effects: For he lo&s;t all his u&s;ual Spright|line&s;s and Gaiety of Temper, and became not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and ab&s;ent in Company; nay, if ever he put on a forced Mirth, to
<PB N="230" REF="245">
comply with Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Humour, the Con&s;traint appeared &s;o plain, that he may &s;eem to have been giv|ing the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence of what he endeavoured to conceal by &s;uch O&s;tentation.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be a Que&s;tion, whether the Art which he u&s;ed to conceal his Pa&s;&s;ion, or the Means which hone&s;t Nature employed to reveal it, betrayed him mo&s;t: For while Art made him more than ever re&s;erved to <HI>Sophia,</HI> and forbad him to addre&s;s any of his Di&s;cour&s;e to her; nay, to avoid meeting her Eyes, with the utmo&s;t Caution; Nature was no le&s;s bu&s;y in counterplotting him. Hence, at the Approach of the young Lady, he grew pale; and if this was &s;ud|den, &s;tarted. If his Eyes accidentally met hers, the Blood ru&s;hed into his Cheeks, and his Countenance became all over Scarlet. If common Civility ever o|bliged him to &s;peak to her, as to drink her Health at Table, his Tongue was &s;ure to faulter. If he touch|ed her, his Hand, nay his whole Frame trembled. And if any Di&s;cour&s;e tended, however remotely, to rai&s;e the Idea of Love, an involuntary Sigh &s;eldom failed to &s;teal from his Bo&s;om. Mo&s;t of which Accidents Nature was wonderfully indu&s;trious to throw in his Way.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Symptoms e&s;caped the Notice of the Squire; but not &s;o of <HI>Sophia.</HI> She &s;oon perceived the&s;e Agitations of Mind in <HI>Jones,</HI> and was at no Lo&s;s to di&s;cover the Cau&s;e; for indeed &s;he recognized it in her own Brea&s;t. And this Recognition is, I &s;up|po&s;e, that Sympathy which hath been &s;o often noted in Lovers, and which will &s;ufficiently account for her being &s;o much quicker-&s;ighted than her Father.</P>
<P>But, to &s;ay the Truth, there is a more &s;imple and plain Method of accounting for that prodigious Su|periority of Penetration which we mu&s;t ob&s;erve in &s;ome Men over the re&s;t of the human Species, and one which will not only &s;erve in the Ca&s;e of Lovers, but of all others. For whence is it that the Knave is ge|nerally
<PB N="231" REF="246">
&s;o quick-&s;ighted to tho&s;e Symptoms and Ope|rations of Knavery which often dupe an hone&s;t Man of a much better Under&s;tanding? There &s;urely is no general Sympathy among Knaves, nor have they, like Free Ma&s;ons, any common Sign of Communication. In reality, it is only becau&s;e they have the &s;ame thing in their Heads, and their thoughts are turned the &s;ame Way. Thus, that <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;aw, and that <HI>We&s;tern</HI> did not &s;ee the plain Symptoms of Love in <HI>Jones</HI> can be no Wonder, when we con&s;ider that the Idea of Love never entered into the Head of the Father, whereas the Daughter, at pre&s;ent, thought of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>When <HI>Sophia</HI> was well &s;atisfied of the Pa&s;&s;ion which tormented poor <HI>Jones,</HI> and no le&s;s certain that &s;he her&s;elf was its Object, &s;he had not the lea&s;t Diffi|culty in di&s;covering the true Cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent Be|haviour. This highly endeared him to her, and rai&s;|ed in her Mind two of the be&s;t Affections which any Lover can wi&s;h to rai&s;e in a Mi&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e were E&s;teem and Pity; for &s;ure the mo&s;t outragiou&s;ly rigid among her Sex will excu&s;e her pitying a Man, whom &s;he &s;aw mi&s;erable on her own Account; nor can they blame her for e&s;teeming one who vi&s;ibly from the mo&s;t honourable Motives, endeavoured to &s;mother a Flame in his own Bo&s;om, which, like the famous <HI>Spartan</HI> Theft, was preying upon, and con&s;uming his very Vitals. Thus his Backwardne&s;s, his Shun|ning her, his Coldne&s;s and his Silence, were the for|warde&s;t, the mo&s;t diligent, the warme&s;t, and mo&s;t eloquent Advocates; and wrought &s;o violently on her &s;en&s;ible and tender Heart, that &s;he &s;oon felt for him all tho&s;e gentle Sen&s;ations which are con&s;i&s;tent with a virtuous and elevated female Mind&mdash;In &s;hort, all which e&s;teem, Gratitude and Pity, can in&s;pire, in &s;uch, towards an agreeable Man&mdash;Indeed, all which the nice&s;t Delicacy can allow&mdash;In a Word,&mdash;&s;he was in Love with him to Di&s;traction.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247">
One Day, this young Couple accidentally met in the Garden, at the End of two Walks, which were both bounded by that Canal in which <HI>Jones</HI> had for|merly ri&s;qued drowning to retrieve the little Bird that <HI>Sophia</HI> had there lo&s;t.</P>
<P>This Place had been of late much frequented by <HI>Sophia.</HI> Here &s;he u&s;ed to ruminate, with a Mixture of Pain and Plea&s;ure, on an Incident, which, how|ever trifling in it&s;elf, had po&s;&s;ibly &s;own the fir&s;t Seeds of that Affection which was now arrived to &s;uch Ma|turity in her Heart.</P>
<P>Here then this young Couple met. They were almo&s;t clo&s;e together before either of them knew any Thing of the other's Approach. A By-&s;tander would have di&s;covered &s;ufficient Marks of Confu&s;ion, in the Countenance of each; but they felt too much them|&s;elves to make any Ob&s;ervation. As &s;oon as <HI>Jones</HI> had a little recovered his fir&s;t Surprize, he acco&s;ted the young Lady with &s;ome of the ordinary forms of Salutati|on, which &s;he in the &s;ame Manner returned, and their Conver&s;ation began, as u&s;ual, on the delicious Beau|ty of the Morning. Hence they pa&s;&s;ed to the Beauty of the Place, on which <HI>Jones</HI> launched forth very high Encomiums. When they came to the Tree whence he had formerly tumbled into the Canal, <HI>Sophia</HI> could not help reminding him of that Accident, and &s;aid, 'I fancy, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> you have &s;ome little &s;hudder|ing when you &s;ee that Water.' 'I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'the Concern you felt at the Lo&s;s of your little Bird, will always appear to me the highe&s;t Circum&s;tance in that Adventure. Poor little <HI>Tommy,</HI> there is the Branch he &s;tood up|on. How could the little Wretch have the Folly to fly away from that State of Happine&s;s in which I had the Honour to place him? His Fate was a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for his Ingratitude.' 'Upon my Word, Mr. <HI>Jones.'</HI> &s;aid &s;he, 'your Gallantry very nar|rowly e&s;caped as &s;evere a Fate. Sure, the Re|membrance

mu&s;t affect you.' 'Indeed, Madam,' an&s;wered he, 'if I have any Rea&s;on to reflect with Sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the Water had not been a little deeper, by which I might have e&s;|caped many bitter Heart-achs, that Fortune &s;eems to have in Store for me.' 'Fie, Mr. <HI>Jones.'</HI> re|plied <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I am &s;ure you cannot be in Earne&s;t now. This affected Contempt of Life is only an Exce&s;s of your Complai&s;ance to me. You would endeavour to le&s;&s;en the Obligation of having twice ventured it for my Sake. Beware the third Time.'&mdash;She &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t Words with a Smile and a Soft|ne&s;s inexpre&s;&s;ible. <HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered with a Sigh, 'He feared it was already too late for Caution,'&mdash;and then looking tenderly and &s;tedfa&s;tly on her, he cry'd, 'Oh! Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,&mdash;</HI>Can you de&s;ire me to live? Can you wi&s;h me &s;o ill?'&mdash;<HI>Sophia</HI> looking down on the Ground, an&s;wered with &s;ome He&s;itation. Indeed, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I do not wi&s;h you ill.'&mdash;Oh! I know too well that heavenly Temper,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'that divine Goodne&s;s which is beyond e|very other Charm.' Nay, now,' an&s;wered &s;he, I under&s;tand you not.&mdash;I can &s;tay no longer,&mdash;I&mdash;. I would not be under&s;tood,' cries he,' 'nay, I can't be under&s;tood. I know not what I &s;ay. Meeting here &s;o unexpectedly&mdash;I have been un|guarded&mdash;for Heaven's Sake pardon me, if I have &s;aid any Thing to offend you&mdash;I did not mean it&mdash;indeed, I would rather have died&mdash;nay, the very Thought would kill me.' 'You &s;urprize me.' an&s;wered &s;he,&mdash;'How can you po&s;&s;ibly think you have offended me?' 'Fear, Madam,' &s;ays he, ea&s;ily runs into Madne&s;s; and there is no Degree of Fear like that which I feel of offending you. How can I &s;peak then? Nay don't look angrily at me, one Frown will de&s;troy me.&mdash;I mean nothing&mdash;Blame my Eyes, or blame tho&s;e Beauties&mdash;

What am I &s;aying? Pardon me if I have &s;aid too much. My Heart overflowed. I have &s;truggled with my Love to the utmo&s;t, and have endeavour|ed to conceal a Fever which preys on my Vitals, and will, I hope, &s;oon make it impo&s;&s;ible for me' ever to offend you more.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> now fell a trembling as if he had been &s;haken with the Fit of an Ague. <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was in a Situation not very different from his, an&s;wered in the&s;e Words: 'Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I will not affect to mi&s;under&s;tand you; indeed I under&s;tand you too well; but for Heaven's Sake, if you have any Af|fection for me, let me make the be&s;t of my way into the Hou&s;e. I wi&s;h I may be able to &s;upport my&s;elf thither.'</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who was hardly able to &s;upport him&s;elf, offered her his Arm, which &s;he conde&s;cended to ac|cept, but begged he would not mention a Word more to her of this Nature at pre&s;ent. He promi&s;ed he would not, in&s;i&s;ting only on her Forgivene&s;s of what Love, without the Leave of his Will, had forc|ed from him: This, &s;he told him, he knew how to obtain by his future Behaviour; and thus this young Pair tottered and trembled along, the Lover not once daring to &s;queeze the Hand of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' it was locked in his.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> immediately retired to her Chamber, where Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> and the Hart&s;horn were &s;ummoned to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. As to poor <HI>Jones,</HI> the only Relief to his di&s;tempered Mind, was an unwelcome Piece of News, which, as it opens a Scene of a different Na|ture from tho&s;e in which the Reader hath lately been conver&s;ant, will be communicated to him in the next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In which Mr.</HI> Allworthy <HI>appears on a Sick-Bed.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was become &s;o fond of <HI>Jones,</HI> that he was unwilling to part with him, tho' his Arm had been long &s;ince cured; and <HI>Jones,</HI> either from his Love of Sport, or from &s;ome other Rea&s;on, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to continue at his Hou&s;e, which he did &s;ometimes for a Fortnight together without pay|ing a &s;ingle Vi&s;it at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s; nay, without ever hearing from thence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had been for &s;ome Days indi&s;po&s;ed with a Cold, which had been attended with a little Fe|ver. This he had, however, neglected, as it was u&s;ual with him to do all Manner of Di&s;orders which did not confine him to his Bed, or prevent his &s;everal Faculties from performing their ordinary Functions. A Conduct which we would by no Means be thought to approve or recommend to Imitation: For &s;urely the Gentlemen of the <HI>Ae&s;culapian</HI> Art are in the Right in advi&s;ing, that the Moment the Di&s;ea&s;e is entered at one Door, the Phy&s;ician &s;hould be introduced at the other; what el&s;e is meant by that old Adage, <HI>Venienti <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ccurrite Morbo?</HI> "Oppo&s;e a Di&s;temper at its fir&s;t Approach." Thus the Doctor and the Di&s;ea&s;e meet in fair and equal Conflict; whereas, by giving Time to the latter, we often &s;uffer him to fortify and en|trench him&s;elf, like a <HI>French</HI> Army; &s;o that the learned Gentleman finds it very difficult, and &s;ome|times impo&s;&s;ible to come at the Enemy. Nay &s;ome|times by gaining Time, the Di&s;ea&s;e applies to the <HI>French</HI> military Politics, and corrupts Nature over to his Side, and then all the Powers of Phy&s;ick mu&s;t ar|rive too late. Agreeable to the&s;e Ob&s;ervations was, I remember, the complaint of the great Doctor <HI>Mi&s;|aubin,</HI> who u&s;ed very pathetically to lament the late Applications which were made to his Skill: Saying,
<PB N="236" REF="251">
'Bygar, me believe my Pation take me for de Under taker: For dey never &s;end for me till de Phy&s;icion have kill dem.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Di&s;temper, by Means of this Neg|lect, gained &s;uch Ground, that when the Increa&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Fever obliged him to &s;end for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Doc|tor at his fir&s;t Arrival &s;hook his Head, wi&s;hed he had been &s;ent for &s;ooner, and intimated that he thought him in very imminent Danger. Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> who had &s;ettled all his Affairs in the World, and was as well prepared, as it is po&s;&s;ible for human Nature to be, for the other, received this Information with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s and Unconcern. He could indeed, whenever he laid him&s;elf down to Re&s;t, &s;ay with <HI>Cato</HI> in the tragical Poem,</P>
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;Let Guilt or Fear</HI></L>
<L><HI>Di&s;turb Man's Re&s;t,</HI> Cato <HI>knows neither of them;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Indifferent in his Choice, to &s;leep or die.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In Reality, he could &s;ay this with ten times more Rea&s;on and Confidence than <HI>Cato,</HI> or any other proud Fellow among the antient or modern Heroes: For he was not only devoid of Fear; but might be con&s;i|dered as a faithful Labourer, when at the End of Harve&s;t, he is &s;ummoned to receive his Reward at the Hands of a bountiful Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The good Man gave immediate Orders for all his Family to be &s;ummoned round him. None of the&s;e were then abroad, but Mrs. <HI>Blifil</HI> who had been &s;ome Time in <HI>London,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> whom the Reader hath ju&s;t parted from at Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s and who re|ceived this Summons ju&s;t as <HI>Sophia</HI> had left him.</P>
<P>The News of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Danger (for the Servant told him he was dying) drove all Thoughts of Love out of his Head. He hurried in&s;tantly into the Chariot which was &s;ent for him, and ordered the
<PB N="237" REF="252">
Coachman to drive with all imaginable Ha&s;te; nor did the Idea of <HI>Sophia,</HI> I believe, once occur to him on the Way.</P>
<P>And now, the whole Family, namely, Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thwackum,</HI> Mr. <HI>Square,</HI> and &s;ome of the Servants (for &s;uch were Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Or|ders) being all a&s;&s;embled round his Bed, the good Man &s;at up in it, and was beginning to &s;peak, when <HI>Blifil</HI> fell to blubbering; and began to expre&s;s very loud and bitter Lamentations. Upon this Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> &s;hook him by the Hand, and &s;aid, 'Do not &s;orrow thus, my dear Nephew, at the mo&s;t ordi|nary of all human Occurrences. When Misfor|tunes befal our Friends we are ju&s;tly grieved: For tho&s;e are Accidents which might often have been avoided, and which may &s;eem to render the Lot of one Man, more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but Death is certainly unavoidable, and is that common Lot, in which alone the Fortunes of all Men agree; nor is the Time when this happens to us material. If the wi&s;e&s;t of Men hath com|pared Life to a Span, &s;urely we may be allowed to con&s;ider it as a Day. It is my Fate to leave it in the Evening; but tho&s;e who are taken away ear|lier, have only lo&s;t a few Hours, at the be&s;t little worth lamenting, and much oftner Hours of La|bour and Fatigue, of Pain and Sorrow. One of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, I remember, likens our leaving Life to our Departure from a Fea&s;t. A Thought which hath often occurred to me, when I have &s;een Men &s;truggling to protract an Entertainment, and to enjoy the Company of their Friends a few Moments longer. Alas! how &s;hort is the mo&s;t protracted of &s;uch Enjoyments! How immaterial the Difference between him who retires the &s;oone&s;t, and him who &s;tays the late&s;t!

Few Men, I own think in this Manner: for, indeed, few Men think of Death 'till they are in its Jaws. However gi|gantic and terrible an Object this may appear when it approaches them, they are neverthele&s;s incapa|ble of &s;eeing it at any Di&s;tance; nay, tho' they have been ever &s;o much frightned and alarmed when they have apprehended them&s;elves in Danger o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> dying, they are no &s;ooner cleared from this Ap|prehen&s;ion than even the Fears of it are era&s;ed from their Minds.

<P>'Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear Child, on this Occa&s;ion; an Event which may happen every Hour, which every Element, nay almo&s;t every Particle of Matter that &s;urrounds us is capa|ble of producing, and which mu&s;t and will mo&s;t unavoidably reach us all at la&s;t, ought neither to occa&s;ion our Surprize, nor our Lamentation.'</P>

<P>'The E&s;tate of <HI>500l.</HI> a Year I have given to you, Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> And as I know the Inconvenience which attends the Want of ready Money, I have added <HI>1000l.</HI> in Specie. In this I know not whether I have exceeded, or fallen &s;hort of your Expectata|tion. Perhaps you will think I have given you too little, and the World will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much; but the latter Cen|&s;ure I de&s;pi&s;e, and as to the former, unle&s;s you &s;hould entertain that common Error, which I have often heard in my Life pleaded as an Excu&s;e for a total Want of Charity; namely, that in&s;tead of rai&s;|ing Gratitude by voluntary Acts of Bounty, we are apt to rai&s;e Demands, which of all others are the mo&s;t boundle&s;s and mo&s;t difficult to &s;atisfiy.&mdash;Pardon me the bare Mention of this, I will not &s;u&s;pect any &s;uch Thing.'</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> flung him&s;elf at his Benefactor's Feet, and taking eagerly hold of his Hand, a&s;&s;ured him, his Goodne&s;s to him, both now, and at all other Times, had &s;o infinitely exceeded not only his Merit, but his Hopes, that no Words could expre&s;s his Sen&s;e of it.

<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> then gently &s;queezed his Hand, and pro|ceeded thus. 'I am convinced, my Child, that you have much Goodne&s;s, Genero&s;ity and Honour in your Temper, if you will add Prudence and Reli|gion to the&s;e, you mu&s;t be happy: For the three

<P>The Phy&s;ician dined that Day at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s and having after Dinner vi&s;ited his Patient, he return+ed to the Company, and told them, that he had not
<PB N="249" REF="264">
the Satisfaction to &s;ay, with A&s;&s;urance; that his Pa|tient was out of all Danger: That he had brought his Fever to a perfect Intermi&s;&s;ion, and doubted not by throwing in the Bark to prevent its return.</P>
<P>This Account &s;o plea&s;ed <HI>Jones,</HI> and threw him in|to &s;uch immoderate Exce&s;s of Rapture, that he might be truly &s;aid to be drunk with Joy. An Intoxicati|on which greatly forwards the Effects of Wine; and as he was very free too with the Bottle on this Occa|&s;ion, (for he drank many Bumpers to the Doctor's Health, as well as to other Toa&s;ts) he became very &s;oon literally drunk.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had naturally violent animal Spirits. The&s;e being &s;et on Float, and augmented by the Spirit of Wine, produced mo&s;t extravagant Effects. He ki&s;&s;ed the Doctor, and embraced him with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate Endearments; &s;wearing that, next to Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> him&s;elf, he loved him of all Men living.' 'Doctor,' added he, 'you de&s;erve a Statue to be erected to you at the public Expence, for having pre&s;erved a Man, who is not only the Darling of all good Men who know him, but a Ble&s;&s;ing to Society, the Glory of his Country, and an Honour to human Nature.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> now looking on <HI>Thwackum</HI> with inconceiva|ble Di&s;dain, an&s;wered, 'And doth thy mcan Soul imagine that any &s;uch Con&s;iderations could weigh with me?

<P>The Doctor now interpo&s;ed, and prevented the Effects of a Wrath which was kindling between <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Thwackum;</HI> after which the former gave a Loo&s;e to Mirth, &s;ang two or three amorous Songs, and fell into every frantic Di&s;order which unbridled Joy is apt to in&s;pire; but &s;o far was he from any Di&s;po&s;i|tion to quarrel, that he was ten times better humour|ed, if po&s;&s;ible, than when he was &s;ober.</P>
<P>To &s;ay Truth, nothing is more erroneous than the common Ob&s;ervation, That Men who are ill-na|tured and quarrel&s;ome when they are drunk, are very worthy Per&s;ons when they are &s;ober: For Drink, in reality, doth not rever&s;e Nature, or create Pa&s;&s;ions in Men, which did not exi&s;t in them before. It takes away the Guard of Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently forces us to produce tho&s;e Symptoms, which many, when &s;ober, have Art enough to conceal. It heigh|tens and inflames our Pa&s;&s;ions (generally indeed that Pa&s;&s;ion which is uppermo&s;t in our Mind) &s;o that the angry Temper, the amorous, the generous, the good humoured, the avaricious, and all other Di&s;po&s;itions of Men, are in their Cups heightened and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And yet as no Nation produces &s;o many drunken Quarrels, e&s;pecially among the lower People, as <HI>England;</HI> (for, indeed, with them, to drink and to fight together are almo&s;t &s;ynonimous Terms;) I would not, methinks, have it thence concluded that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are the wor&s;t-natured People alive. Per|haps the Love of Glory only is at the Bottom of this; &s;o that the fair Conclu&s;ion &s;eems to be, that our Countrymen have more of that Love, and more of
<PB N="251" REF="266">
Bravery, than any other Plebeians. And this the rather, as there is &s;eldom any thing ungenerous, un|fair, or ill-natured, exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions: Nay, it is common for the Combatants to expre&s;s Good-will for each other, even at the Time of the Conflict; and as their drunken Mirth generally ends in a Battle, &s;o do mo&s;t of their Battles end in Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>But to return to our Hi&s;tory. Tho' <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;hewn no De&s;ign of giving Offence, yet Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> was highly offended at a Behaviour which was &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ober and prudent Re&s;erve of his own Temper. He bore it too with the greater Impa|tience, as it appeared to him very indecent at this Sea|&s;on; 'when,' as he &s;aid, 'the Hou&s;e was a Hou&s;e of Mourning, on the Account of his dear Mother; and if it had plea&s;ed Heaven to give them &s;ome Pro&s;pect of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Recovery, it would become them better to expre&s;s the Exultations of their Hearts in Thank&s;giving than in Drunkenne&s;s and Riots; which were properer Methods to encrea&s;e the divine Wrath, than to avert it.' <HI>Thwackum,</HI> who had &s;wallowed more Liquor than <HI>Jones,</HI> but without any ill Effect on his Brain, &s;econded the pious Harangue of <HI>Blifil;</HI> but <HI>Square</HI> for Rea&s;ons which the Reader may probably gue&s;s, was totally &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Wine had not &s;o totally overpowered <HI>Jones,</HI> as to prevent his recollecting on Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Lo&s;s, the Mo|ment it was mentioned. As no Per&s;on, therefore, was more ready to confe&s;s and condemn his own Er|rors, he offered to &s;hake Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> by the Hand, and begged his Pardon, &s;aying, 'His exce&s;&s;ive Joy for Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Recovery had driven every o|ther Thought out of his Mind.'</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> &s;cornfully rejected his Hand; and, with much Indignation, an&s;wered, 'It was little to be wondered at, if tragical Spectacles made no Impre&s;&s;ions on the Blind; but for his Part, he had the Misfortune
<PB N="252" REF="267">
to know who his Parents were, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be affected with their Lo&s;s.'</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding his good Humour, had &s;ome Mixture of the ira&s;cible in his Con&s;titution, leaped ha&s;tily from his Chair, and catching hold of <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Collar, cried out, 'D&mdash;n you for a Ra&s;cal, do you in&s;ult me with the Misfortune of my Birth' He accompanied the&s;e Words with &s;uch rough Acti|ons, that they &s;oon got the better of Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s peace|able Temper; and a Scuffle immediately en&s;ued, which might have produced Mi&s;chief, had it not been prevented by the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Thwackum</HI> and the Phy&s;ician; for the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Square</HI> rendered him &s;uperior to all Emotions, and he very calmly &s;moaked his Pipe, as was his Cu&s;tom in all Broils, unle&s;s when he apprehended &s;ome Danger of having it broke in his Mouth.</P>
<P>The Combatants being now prevented from exe|cuting pre&s;ent Vengeance on each other, betook them&s;elves to the common Re&s;ources of di&s;appointed Rage, and vented their Wrath in Threats and Defi|ance. In this kind of Conflict, Fortune, which, in the per&s;onal Attack, &s;eemed to incline to <HI>Jones,</HI> was now altogether as favourable to his Enemy.</P>
<P>A Truce, neverthele&s;s was at length agreed on, by the Mediation of the neutral Parties, and the whole Company again &s;at down at the Table; where <HI>Jones</HI> being prevailed on to a&s;k Pardon, and <HI>Blifil</HI> to give it, Peace was re&s;tored and every thing &s;eemed in <HI>Statu quo.</HI></P>
<P>But though the Quarrel was, in all Appearance, perfectly reconciled, the good humour which had been interrupted by it, was by no means re&s;tored.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> retired from the Company, in which we have &s;een him engaged, into the Fields, where he intended to cool him&s;elf by a Walk in the open Air, before he attended Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> There, whil&s;t he renewed tho&s;e Meditations on his dear <HI>Sophia,</HI> which the dangerous Illne&s;s of his Friend and Bene|factor had for &s;ome time interrupted, an Accident hap|pened, which with Sorrow, we relate, and with Sor|row, doubtle&s;s, will it be read; however, that hi&s;toric Truth to which we profe&s;s &s;o inviolable an Attach|ment, obliges us to communicate it to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It was now a plea&s;ant Evening in the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> when our Heroe was walking in a mo&s;t delici|ous Grove, where the gentle Breezes fanning the Leaves, together with the &s;weet Trilling of a murmur|ing Stream, and the melodious Notes of Nightin|gales formed all together the mo&s;t enchanting Har|mony. In this Scene, &s;o &s;weetly accommodated to Love, he meditated on his dear <HI>Sophia.</HI> While his wanton Fancy roved unbounded over all her Beauties, and his lively Imagination painted the charming Maid in various ravi&s;hing Forms his warm Heart melted
<PB N="254" REF="269">
with Tenderne&s;s, and at length throwing him&s;elf on the ground by the Side of a gentle murmuring Brook, he broke forth into the following Ejaculation.</P>
<P>'O <HI>Sophia,</HI> would Heaven give thee to my Arms, how ble&s;t would be my Condition! Cur&s;t be that Fortune which &s;ets a Di&s;tance between us. Was I but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thee, one only Suit of Rags thy whole E&s;tate, is there a Man on Earth whom I would envy! How contemptible would the brighte&s;t <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Beauty, dre&s;t in all the Jewels of the <HI>Indies,</HI> appear to my Eyes! But why do I mention another Woman? could I think my Eyes capable of looking at any other with Tenderne&s;s, the&s;e Hands &s;hould tear them from my Head. No, my <HI>Sophia,</HI> if cruel Fortune &s;eparates us for ever, my Soul &s;hall doat on thee alone. The cha&s;te&s;t Con|&s;tancy will I ever pre&s;erve to thy Image. Tho' I &s;hould never have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thy charming Per|&s;on, &s;till &s;halt thou alone have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Thoughts, my Love, my Soul. Oh! my fond Heart is &s;o wrapt in that tender Bo&s;om, that the brighte&s;t Beauties would for me have no Charms, nor would a hermit be colder in their Embraces. <HI>Sophia, Sophia</HI> alone &s;hall be mine. What Raptures are in that Name! I will engrave it on every Tree.'</P>
<P>At the&s;e Words he &s;tarted up, and behold&mdash;not his <HI>Sophia&mdash;</HI>no, nor a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Maid richly and ele|gantly attired for the Grand Signior's Seraglio. No; without a Gown, in a Shift that was &s;omewhat of the coar&s;e&s;t, and none of the cleane&s;t, bedewed likewi&s;e with &s;ome odoriferous Effluvia, the Produce of the Day's Labour, with a Pitch-fork in her Hand, <HI>Molly Seagrim</HI> approached. Our Hero had his Pen-knife in his Hand, which he had drawn for the before-mentioned Purpo&s;e, of carving on the Bark; when the Girl coming near him cry'd out with a Smile, 'You don't intend to kill me, Squire I hope!' 'Why &s;hould you think I would kill you?' an&s;wered
<PB N="255" REF="270">
<HI>Jones.</HI> 'Nay,' replied &s;he, 'after your cruel U&s;age of me when I &s;aw you la&s;t, killing me would, per|haps, be too great Kindne&s;s for me to expect.'</P>
<P>Here en&s;ued a Parly, which, as I do not think my&s;elf obliged to relate, I &s;hall omit. It is &s;uffi|cient that it la&s;ted a full Quarter of an Hour, at the Conclu&s;ion of which they retired into the thicke&s;t Part of the Grove.</P>
<P>Some of my Readers may be inclined to think this Event unnatural. However, the Fact is true; and, perhaps, may be &s;ufficiently accounted for, by &s;ug|ge&s;ting that <HI>Jones</HI> probably thought one Woman bet|ter than none, and <HI>Molly</HI> as probably imagined two Men to be better than one. Be&s;ides the before men|tioned Motive a&s;&s;igned to the pre&s;ent Behaviour of <HI>Jones,</HI> the Reader will be likewi&s;e plea&s;ed to recollect in his Favour, that he was not at this Time perfect Ma&s;ter of that wonderful Power of Rea&s;on, which &s;o well enables grave and wi&s;e Men to &s;ubdue their unruly Pa&s;&s;ions, and to decline any of the&s;e prohi|bited Amu&s;ements. Wine now had totally &s;ubdued this Power in <HI>Jones.</HI> He was, indeed, in a Condi|tion, in which if Rea&s;on had interpo&s;ed, tho' only to advi&s;e, &s;he might have received the An&s;wer which one <HI>Cleo&s;tratus</HI> gave many Years ago to a &s;illy Fellow, who a&s;ked him if he was not a&s;hamed to be drunk? 'Are not you,' &s;aid <HI>Cleo&s;tratus,</HI> 'a&s;hamed to admo|ni&s;h a drunken Man?'&mdash;To &s;ay the Truth, in a Court of Ju&s;tice, Drunkenne&s;s mu&s;t not be an Excu&s;e, yet in a Court of Con&s;cience it is greatly &s;o; and therefore <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who commends the Laws of <HI>Pit|tacus,</HI> by which drunken Men received double Puni&s;h|ment for their Crimes, allows there is more of Poli|cy than Ju&s;tice in that Law. Now, if there are any Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions pardonable from Drunkenne&s;s, they are certainly &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was at pre&s;ent guilty of; on which Head I could pour forth a va&s;t Profu&s;ion of Learning, if I imagined it would either entertain my
<PB N="256" REF="271">

<P>It hath been ob&s;erved, that Fortune &s;eldom doth&punc; Things by Halves. To &s;ay Truth, there is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> End to her Freaks whenever &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to gratify or di&s;plea&s;e. No &s;ooner had our Heroe retired with his <HI>Dido,</HI> but

the Par&s;on and the young 'Squire, who were taking a &s;erious Walk, arrived at the Stile which leads into the Grove, and the latter caught a View of the Lo|vers, ju&s;t as they were &s;inking out of Sight.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> knew <HI>Jones</HI> very well, tho' he was at above a hundred Yards Di&s;tance, and he was as po&s;itive to the Sex of his Companion, tho' not to the individual Per&s;on. He &s;tarted; ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and uttered a very &s;olemn Ejaculation.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> expre&s;s'd &s;ome Surprize at the&s;e &s;udden Emotions, and a&s;ked the Rea&s;on of them. To which <HI>Blifil</HI> an&s;wered, 'he was certain he had &s;een a Fellow and Wench retire together among the Bu&s;hes, which he doubted not was with &s;ome wicked Purpo&s;e.' As to the Name of <HI>Jones,</HI> he thought proper to conceal it, and why he did &s;o mu&s;t be left to the Judgment of the &s;agacious Reader: For we never chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ign Motives to the Actions of Men, when there is any po&s;&s;ibility of our being mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The Par&s;on, who was not only &s;trictly cha&s;te in his own Per&s;on; but a great Enemy to the oppo&s;ite Vice in all others, fired at this Information. He de|&s;ired Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> to conduct him immediately to the Place, which as he approached, he breathed forth Vengeance mixed with Lamentations; nor did he refrain from ca&s;ting &s;ome oblique Reflections on Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Allworthy;</HI> in&s;inuating that the Wickedne&s;s of the

<P>The Way, through which our Hunters were to pa&s;s in pur&s;uit of their Game, was &s;o be&s;et with Briars, that it greatly ob&s;tructed their Walk, and cau&s;ed, be|&s;ides, &s;uch a ru&s;tling that <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;ufficient Warn|ing of their Arrival, before they could &s;urprize him; nay, indeed, &s;o incapable was <HI>Thwackum</HI> of conceal|ing his Indignation, and &s;uch Vengeance did he mut|ter forth every Step he took, that this alone mu&s;t have abundantly &s;atisfied <HI>Jones,</HI> that he was (to u&s;e the Language of Sport&s;men) <HI>found &s;itting.</HI></P>

'And I mu&s;t tell you plain|ly,' returned <HI>Jones,</HI> 'I am re&s;olved you &s;hall not.' <HI>Thwackum</HI> then offered to advance, and <HI>Jones</HI> laid hold of his Arms; which Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> endeavoured to re&s;cue, declaring 'he would not &s;ee his old Ma&s;ter in&s;ulted.'</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now finding him&s;elf engaged with two, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to rid him&s;elf of one of his An|tagoni&s;ts as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He therefore, applied to the weake&s;t fir&s;t; and letting the Par&s;on go, he directed a Blow at the young Squire's Brea&s;t, which luckily taking Place, reduced him to mea&s;ure his Length on the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> was &s;o intent on the Di&s;covery, that the Moment he found him&s;elf at Liberty, he &s;tept forward directly into the Fern, without any great Con&s;ideration of what might, in the mean Time, be|fal his Friend; but he had advanced a very few Paces into the Thicket, before <HI>Jones</HI> having defeated <HI>Blifil,</HI> overtook the Par&s;on, and dragged him backward by the Skirt of his Coat.</P>
<P>This Par&s;on had been a Champion in his Youth, and had won much Honour by his Fi&s;t, both at School and at the Univer&s;ity. He had now, indeed, for a great Number of Years, declined the practice of that noble Art; yet was his Courage full as &s;trong as his Faith, and his Body no le&s;s &s;trong than either. He was moreover, as the Reader may, perhaps, have conceived, &s;omewhat ira&s;cible in his Nature. When he looked back, therefore, and &s;aw his Friend &s;tretch|ed out on the Ground, and found him&s;elf at the &s;ame Time &s;o roughly handled by one who had formerly
<PB N="260" REF="275">
been only pa&s;&s;ive in all Conflicts between them, (a Cir|cum&s;tance which highly aggravated the whole) his Pa|tience at length gave Way; he threw him&s;elf into a Po&s;ture of Offence, and collecting all his Force, at|tacked <HI>Jones</HI> in the Front, with as much Impetuo&s;ity as he had formerly attacked him in the Rear.</P>
<P>Our Heroe received the Enemy's Attack with the mo&s;t undaunted Intrepidity, and his Bo&s;om re&s;ounded with the Blow. This he pre&s;ently returned with no le&s;s Violence, aiming likewi&s;e at the Par&s;on's Brea&s;t; but he dextrou&s;ly drove down the Fi&s;t of <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;o that it reached only his Belly, where two Pounds of Beef and as many of Pudding were then depo&s;ited, and whence con&s;equently no hollow Sound could proceed. Many lu&s;ty Blows, much more plea&s;ant as well as ea&s;y to have &s;een, than to read or de&s;cribe, were given on both Sides; at la&s;t a violent Fall in which <HI>Jones</HI> had thrown his Knees into <HI>Thwackum'</HI>s Brea&s;t, &s;o weak|ened the latter, that Victory had been no longer dubious, had not <HI>Blifil,</HI> who had now recovered his Strength, again renewed the Fight, and, by engaging with <HI>Jones,</HI> given the Par&s;on a Moment's Time to &s;hake his Ears, and to regain his Breath.</P>
<P>And now both together attacked our Heroe, who&s;e Blows did not retain that Force with which they had fallen at fir&s;t; &s;o weakened was he by his Combat with <HI>Thwackum:</HI> For though the Pedagogue cho&s;e rather to play <HI>Solos</HI> on the human In&s;trument, and had been lately u&s;ed to tho&s;e only, yet he &s;till retain|ed enough of his ancient Knowledge to perform his Part very well in a <HI>Duet.</HI></P>
<P>The Victory, according to modern Cu&s;tom, was like to be decided by Numbers, when on a &s;udden, a fourth Pair of Fi&s;ts appeared in the Battle, and imme|diately paid their Compliments to the Par&s;on; the Owner of them, at the &s;ame Time, crying out,' Are not you a&s;hamed and be d&mdash;nd to you, to fall two of you upon one?</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="276">
The Battle, which was of the Kind, that for Di&s;|tinction's Sake is called ROYAL, now raged with the utmo&s;t Violence during a few Minutes; till <HI>Blifil</HI> being a &s;econd Time laid &s;prawling by <HI>Jones, Thwach|um</HI> conde&s;cended to apply for Quarter to his new Antagoni&s;t, who was now found to be Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> him&s;elf: For in the Heat of the Action none of the Combatants had recognized him.</P>
<P>In Fact, that hone&s;t 'Squire, happening in his Af|ternoon's Walk with &s;ome Company, to pa&s;s through the Field where the bloody Battle was fought, and having concluded from &s;eeing three Men engaged, that two of them mu&s;t be on a Side, he ha&s;tened from his Companions, and with more Gallantry than Po|licy, e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of the weaker Party. By which generous Proceeding, he very probably pre|vented Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> from becoming a Victim to the Wrath of <HI>Thwackum,</HI> and to the pious Friend&s;hip which <HI>Blifil</HI> bore his old Ma&s;ter: For be&s;ides the Di&s;advantage of &s;uch Odds, <HI>Jones</HI> had not yet &s;uffi|ciently recovered the former Strength of his broken Arm. This Reinforcement, however, &s;oon put an End to the Action, and <HI>Jones</HI> with his Ally obtained the Victory.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In which is &s;een a more moving Spectacle, than all the Blood in the Bodies of</HI> Thwackum <HI>and</HI> Blifil <HI>and of twenty other &s;uch, is capable of producing.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE re&s;t of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Company were now come up, being ju&s;t at the In&s;tant when the Action was over. The&s;e were the hone&s;t Clergy|man, whom we have formerly &s;een at Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Table, Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> the Aunt of <HI>Sophia;</HI> and la&s;tly, the lovely <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>At this Time, the following was the A&s;pect of the bloody Field. In one Place, lay on the Ground,
<PB N="262" REF="277">
all pale and almo&s;t breathle&s;s, the vanqui&s;hed <HI>Blifil.</HI> Near him &s;tood the Conqueror <HI>Jones,</HI> almo&s;t covered with Blood, part of which was naturally his own, and part had been lately the Property of the Reve|rend Mr. <HI>Thwackum.</HI> In a third Place &s;tood the &s;aid <HI>Thwackum,</HI> like King <HI>Porus,</HI> &s;ullenly &s;ubmitting to the Conqueror. The la&s;t Figure in the Piece was <HI>We&s;tern the Great,</HI> mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly forbearing the vanqui&s;hed Foe.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil,</HI> in whom there was little Sign of Life, was at fir&s;t the principal Object of the Concern of every one, and particularly of Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who had drawn from her Pocket a Bottle of Hart&s;horn, and was her|&s;elf about to apply it to his No&s;trils; when on a &s;ud|den the Attention of the whole Company was di|verted from poor <HI>Blifil,</HI> who&s;e Spirit, if it had any &s;uch De&s;ign, might have now taken an Opportunity of &s;tealing off to the other World, without any Ce|remony.</P>
<P>For now a more melancholy as more lovely Ob|ject lay motionle&s;s before them. This was no other than the charming <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf, who, from the Sight of Blood, or from Fear of her Father, or from &s;ome other Rea&s;on, had fallen down in a Swoon, before any one could get to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> fir&s;t &s;aw her, and &s;creamed. Im|mediately two or three Voices cried out, 'Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;|tern</HI> is dead.' Hart&s;horn, Water; every Remedy was called for, almo&s;t at one and the &s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Reader may remember, that in our De&s;crip|tion of this Grove, we mentioned a murmuring Brook, which Brook did not come there, as &s;uch gentle Streams flow through vulgar Romances, with no other Purpo&s;e than to murmur. No; Fortune had decreed to enoble this little Brook with a higher Ho|nour than any of tho&s;e which wa&s;h the Plains of <HI>Arca|dia,</HI> ever de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="278">
<HI>Jones</HI> was rubbing <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Temples: For he be|gan to fear he had given him a Blow too much, when the Words Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and Death ru&s;hed at once on his Ear. He &s;tarted up, left <HI>Blifil</HI> to his Fate, and flew to <HI>Sophia,</HI> whom, while all the re&s;t were running again&s;t each other backward and forward look|ing for Water in the dry Paths, he caught up in his Arms, and then ran away with her over the Field to the Rivulet above-mentioned: where, plunging him|&s;elf into the Water, he contrived to be&s;prinkle her Face, Head, and Neck very plentifully.</P>
<P>Happy was it for <HI>Sophia,</HI> that the &s;ame Confu&s;ion which prevented her other Friends from &s;erving her, prevented them likewi&s;e from ob&s;tructing <HI>Jones.</HI> He had carried her half ways before they knew what he was doing, and he had actually re&s;tored her to Life be|fore they reached the Water-&s;ide: She &s;tretched out her Arms, opened her Eyes and cried, 'Oh, Heavens!' ju&s;t as her Father, Aunt and the Par&s;on came up.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who had hitherto held this lovely Burthen in his Arms, now relinqui&s;hed his Hold; but gave her at the &s;ame In&s;tant a tender Care&s;s, which, had her Sen&s;es been then perfectly re&s;tored, could not have e&s;caped her Ob&s;ervation. As &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, there|fore no Di&s;plea&s;ure at this Freedom, we &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was not &s;ufficiently recovered from her Swoon at the Time.</P>
<P>This tragical Scene was now converted into a &s;ud|den Scene of Joy. In this, our Heroe was mo&s;t certainly, the principal Character: For he probably felt more extatic Delight in having &s;aved <HI>Sophia,</HI> than &s;he her&s;elf received from being &s;aved; &s;o neither were the Congratulations paid to her, equal to what were conferred on <HI>Jones,</HI> e&s;pecially by Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> him|&s;elf, who, after having once or twice embraced his Daughter, fell to hugging and ki&s;&s;ing <HI>Jones.</HI> He called him the pre&s;erver of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and declared there was nothing except her, or his E&s;tate, which he
<PB N="264" REF="279">
would not give him; but upon Recollection, he af|terwards excepted his Fox-hounds, the Chevalier, and Mi&s;s <HI>Slouch</HI> (for &s;o he called his favourite Mare.)</P>
<P>All Fears for <HI>Sophia</HI> being now removed, <HI>Jones</HI> became the Object of the 'Squire's Con&s;ideration. 'Come, my Lad,' &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern, 'D'off</HI> thy <HI>Quoat</HI> and wa&s;h thy <HI>Feace:</HI> For <HI>att</HI> in a devili&s;h Pickle, I promi&s;e thee. Come, come, wa&s;h thy&s;elf, and <HI>&s;hat</HI> go <HI>Huome</HI> with me; and <HI>wel zee</HI> to <HI>vind</HI> thee another <HI>Quoat.</HI>'</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> immediately complied; threw off his Coat, went down to the Water, and wa&s;hed both his Face and Bo&s;om: For the latter was as much expo&s;ed, and as bloody as the former: But tho' the Water could clear off the Blood, it could not remove the Black and blue Marks which <HI>Thwackum</HI> had imprinted on both his Face and Brea&s;t, and which, being di&s;cerned by <HI>Sophia,</HI> drew from her a Sigh, and a look full of inexpre&s;&s;ible Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> received this full in his Eyes, and it had in|finitely a &s;tronger Effect on him than all the Con|tu&s;ions which he had received before. An Effect, however, widely different; for &s;o &s;oft and balmy was it, that, had all his former Blows been Stabs, it would for &s;ome Minutes have prevented his feeling their Smart.</P>
<P>The Company now moved backwards, and &s;oon arrived where <HI>Thwackum</HI> had got Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> again on his Legs. Here we cannot &s;uppre&s;s a pious Wi&s;h, that all Quarrels were to be decided by tho&s;e Wea|pons only, with which Nature, knowing what is pro|per for us, hath &s;upplied us; and that cold Iron was to be u&s;ed in digging no Bowels, but tho&s;e of the Earth. Then would War, the Pa&s;time of Mo|narchs, be almo&s;t inoffen&s;ive, and Battles between great Armies might be fought at the particular De|&s;ire of &s;everal Ladies of Quality; who together with the Kings them&s;elves, might be actual Spectators of
<PB N="265" REF="280">
the Conflict. Then might the Field be this Moment well &s;trewed with human Carca&s;&s;es, and the next, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he dead Men, or infinitely the greate&s;t Part of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ight get up, like Mr. <HI>Bayes'</HI>s Troops, and march if either at the Sound of a Drum or a Fiddle, as could be previou&s;ly agreed on.</P>
<P>I would avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, treating this Matter lu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">crou&s;ly, le&s;t grave Men and Politicians, whom I now to be offended at a Je&s;t, may cry Pi&s;h at it; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, in reality, might not a Battle be as well decided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">y the greater Number of broken Heads, bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;es, and black Eyes, as by the greater Heaps of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">angled and murdered human Bodies? Might not Towns be contended for in the &s;ame Manner? In|deed, this may be too detrimental a Scheme to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, &s;ince they would lo&s;e the Advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ey have over other Nations, in the Superiority of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">eir Engineers: But when I con&s;ider the Gallantry and Genero&s;ity of that People, I am per&s;uaded they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ould never decline putting them&s;elves upon a Par with their Adver&s;ary; or, as the Phra&s;e is, <HI>making them&s;elves his Match.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uch Reformations are rather to be wi&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an hoped for; I &s;hall content my&s;elf, therefore, with this &s;hort Hint, and return to my Narrative.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tern</HI> began now to enquire into the original Ri&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f this Quarrel. To which neither <HI>Blifil</HI> nor <HI>Jones</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave any An&s;wer; but <HI>Thwackum</HI> &s;aid &s;urlily, 'I be|lieve, the Cau&s;e is not far off; if you beat the Bu&s;hes well you may find her.' 'Find her!' re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lied <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'what have you been fighting for a Wench?' 'A&s;k the Gentleman in his Wa&s;tecoat there,' &s;aid <HI>Thwackum,</HI> 'he be&s;t knows.' 'Nay, then,' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'it is a Wench certainly&mdash;Ah, <HI>Tom, Tom;</HI> thou art a liquori&s;h Dog&mdash;but come, Gentlemen, be all Friends, and go home with me, and make final Peace over a Bottle.' 'I

a&s;k your Pardon, Sir,' &s;ays <HI>Thwackum,</HI> 'it is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch &s;light Matter for a Man of my Character to be thus injuriou&s;ly treated, and buffetted by a Boy only becau&s;e I would have done my Duty, in en|deavouring to detect and bring to Ju&s;tice a wanton Harlot; but, indeed, the principal Fault lies in Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and your&s;elf: For, if you put the Laws in Execution, as you ought to do, you would &s;oon ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Country of the&s;e Vermin.'</P>
<P>'I would as &s;oon rid the Country of Foxes,' cries <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> 'I think we ought to encourage the re|cruiting tho&s;e Numbers which we are every Day lo&s;ing in the War: But where is &s;he?&mdash;Prithee, <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;hew me.' He then began to beat about, in the &s;ame Language, and in the &s;ame Manner, as if he had been beating for a Hare, and at la&s;t cried out, 'Soho! Pu&s;s is not far off. Here's her Form, upon my Soul; I believe I may cry <HI>&s;tole away.'</HI> And indeed &s;o he might, for he had now di&s;covered the Place whence the poor Girl had, at the Beginning of the Fray, <HI>&s;tolen away,</HI> upon as many Feet as a Hare generally u&s;es in travelling.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> now de&s;ired her Father to return home; &s;ay|ing, &s;he found her&s;elf very faint, and apprehended a Relap&s;e. The Squire immediately complied with his Daughter's Reque&s;t (for he was the fonde&s;t of Pa|rents). He earne&s;tly endeavoured to prevail with the whole Company to go and &s;up with him; but <HI>Blifil</HI> and <HI>Thwackum</HI> ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; the former &s;aying, There were more Rea&s;ons than he could then mention, why he mu&s;t decline this Honour; and the latter de|claring (perhaps rightly) that it was not proper for a Per&s;on of his Function to be &s;een at any Place in his pre&s;ent Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was incapable of refu&s;ing the Plea&s;ure of be|ing with his <HI>Sophia.</HI> So on he marched with Squire <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and his Ladies, the Par&s;on bringing up the Rear. This had, indeed, offered to tarry with his
<PB N="267" REF="282">
Brother <HI>Thwackum,</HI> profe&s;&s;ing, his Regard for the Cloth would not permit him to depart; but <HI>Thwackum</HI> would not accept the Favour, and, with no great Civility, pu&s;hed him after Mr. <HI>We&s;tern.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN our la&s;t Book we have been obliged to deal pret|ty much with the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love; and, in our &s;ucceeding Book, &s;hall be forced to handle this Sub|ject &s;till more largely. It may not therefore, in this Place, be improper to apply our&s;elves to the Exami|nation of that modern Doctrine, by which certain Philo&s;ophers, among many other wonderful Di&s;co|veries, pretend to have found out, that there is no &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion in the human Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e Philo&s;ophers be the &s;ame with that &s;urprizing Sect, who are honourably mentioned by the late Dr. <HI>Swift;</HI> as having, by the mere Force of Ge|nius alone, without the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any Kind of Learning, or even Reading, di&s;covered that pro|found and invaluable Secret, That there was no G&mdash;:
<PB N="269" REF="284">
or whether they are not rather &s;he &s;ame with tho&s;e who, &s;ome Years &s;ince, very much alarmed the World, by &s;hewing that there were no &s;uch things as virtue or Goodne&s;s really exi&s;ting in Human Nature, and who deduced our be&s;t Actions from Pride, I will not here pre&s;ume to determine. In reality, I am in|clined to &s;u&s;pect, that all the&s;e &s;everal Finders of Truth are the very identical Men, who are by others called the <HI>Finders of Gold.</HI> The Method u&s;ed in both the&s;e Searches after Truth and after Gold, being, in|deed, one and the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;earching, rum|maging, and examining into a na&s;ty Place; indeed, in the former In&s;tances, into the na&s;tie&s;t of all Places, ABAD MIND.</P>
<P>But though, in this Particular, and perhaps in their Succe&s;s, the Truth-finder, and the Gold-finder, may very properly be compared together; yet in Mode&s;ty, &s;urely, there can be no Compari&s;on between the two; for who ever heard of a Gold-finder that had the Im|pudence or Folly to a&s;&s;ert, from the ill Succe&s;s of his Search, that there was no &s;uch thing as Gold in the World? Whereas the Truth-finder, having raked out that <HI>Jakes</HI> his own Mind, and being there capa|ble of tracing no Ray of Divinity, nor any thing virtuous, or good, or lovely, or loving, very fairly, hone&s;tly, and logically concludes, that no &s;uch things exi&s;t in the whole Creation.</P>
<P>To avoid, however, all Contention, if po&s;&s;ible, with the&s;e Philo&s;ophers, if they will be called &s;o; and to &s;hew our own Di&s;po&s;ition to accommodate Matters peaceably between us, we &s;hall here make them &s;ome Conce&s;&s;ions, which may po&s;&s;ibly put an End to the Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we will grant that many Minds, and perhaps tho&s;e of the Philo&s;ophers, are entirely free from the lea&s;t Traces of &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, That what is commonly called Love, namely, the De&s;ire of &s;atisfying a voracious Appetite
<PB N="270" REF="285">
with a certain Quantity of delicate white human Fle&s;h, is by no Means that Pa&s;&s;ion for which I here contend. This is indeed more properly Hunger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> and as no Glutton is a&s;hamed to apply the Word Love to his Appetite, and to &s;ay he LOVES &s;uch and &s;uch Di&s;hes; &s;o may the Lover of this Kind with equal Propriety &s;ay, he HUNGERS after &s;uch and &s;uch Women.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I will grant, which I believe will be a mo&s;t acceptable Conce&s;&s;ion, that this Love for which I am an Advocate, though it &s;atisfies it&s;elf in a much more delicate Manner, doth neverthele&s;s &s;eek its own Satisfaction as much as the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all our Appe|tites.</P>
<P>And, La&s;tly, That this Love when it operates towards one of a different Sex, is very apt, towards its complete Gratification, to call in the Aid of that Hunger which I have mentioned above; and which it is &s;o far from abating, that it heightens all its De|lights to a Degree &s;carce imaginable by tho&s;e who have never been &s;u&s;ceptible of any other Emotions, than what have proceeded from Appetite alone.</P>
<P>In return to all the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, I de&s;ire of the Philo&s;ophers to grant, that there is in &s;ome (I believe in many) human Brea&s;ts, a kind and benevolent Di&s;|po&s;ition, which is gratified by contributing to the Hap|pine&s;s of others. That in this Gratification alone, as in Friend&s;hip, in parental and filial Affection, and indeed in general Philanthropy, there is a great and exqui&s;ite Delight. That if we will not call &s;uch Di&s;po&s;ition Love, we have no Name for it. That though the Plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from &s;uch pure Love may be hightened and &s;weetened by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a|morous De&s;ires, yet the former can &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, nor are they de&s;troyed by the Intervention of the latter. La&s;tly, That E&s;teem and Gratitude are the proper Motives to Love, as Youth and Beauty are to De&s;ire, and therefore though &s;uch De&s;ire may naturally cea&s;e,
<PB N="271" REF="286">
when Age or Sickne&s;s overtake its Object, yet the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an have no Effect on Love, nor ever &s;hake or remove from a good Mind, that Sen&s;ation or Pa&s;&s;ion which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ath Gratitude and E&s;teem for its Ba&s;is.</P>
<P>To deny the Exi&s;tence of a Pa&s;&s;ion of which we often &s;ee manife&s;t Iu&s;tances, &s;eems to be very &s;trange and ab&s;urd; and can indeed proceed only from that &s;elf-Admonition which we have mentioned above: But how unfair is this?

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Character of Mrs.</HI> We&s;tern. <HI>Her great Learn|ing and Knowledge of the World, and an In&s;tand of the deep Penetration which &s;he derived from tho&s;e Advantages.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Reader hath &s;een Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> his Si&s;ter and Daughter, with young <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Par|&s;on, going together to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Hou&s;e, where the greater Part of the Company &s;pent the Evening with much Joy and Fe&s;tivity. <HI>Sophia</HI> was indeed the only grave Per&s;on: For as to <HI>Jones,</HI> though Love had now gotten entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Heart, yet the plea|&s;ing Reflection on Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Recovery, and the Pre&s;ence of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, joined to &s;ome tender Looks which &s;he now and then could not refrain from giving him, &s;o elevated our Heroe, that he joined the Mirth of the other three, who were perhaps as good humoured People as any in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> retained the &s;ame Gravity of Countenance the next Morning at Breakfa&s;t; whence &s;he retired likewi&s;e earlier than u&s;ual, leaving her Father and Aunt together. The Squire took no Notice of this Change in his Daughter's Di&s;po&s;ition. To &s;ay the Truth, though he was &s;omewhat of a Politician, and had been twice a Candidate in the Country Intere&s;t at an Elec|tion, he was a Man of no great Ob&s;ervation. His Si&s;ter was a Lady of a different Turn. She had liv|ed about the Court, and had &s;een the World. Hence &s;he had acquired all that Knowledge which the &s;aid World u&s;ually communicates; and was a perfect Mi&s;|tre&s;s of Manners, Cu&s;toms, Ceremonies, and Fa&s;hions; nor did her Erudition &s;top here. She had con&s;idera|bly
<PB N="273" REF="288">
improved her Mind by Study; &s;he had not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ead all the modern Plays, Operas, Oratorios, Poems and Romances; in all which &s;he was a Critic; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad gone thro' <HI>Rapin'</HI>s Hi&s;tory of <HI>England, Echard'</HI>s Roman <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and many <HI>French Memoires pour &s;er|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ir a l' Hi&s;toire;</HI> to the&s;e &s;he had added mo&s;t of the political Pamphlets and Journals, publi&s;hed within the la&s;t twenty Years. From which &s;he had attained every competent Skill in Politics, and could di&s;cour&s;e very learnedly on the Affairs of <HI>Europe.</HI> She was moreover excellently well &s;killed in the Doctrine of Amour, and knew better than any body who and who were together: A Knowledge which &s;he the more ea&s;ily attained, as her Pur&s;uit of it was never divert|ed by any Affairs of her own; for either &s;he had no Inclinations, or the&s;e had never been &s;ollicited; which la&s;t is indeed very probable: For her ma&s;culine Per&s;on, which was near &s;ix Foot high, added to her Manner and Learning, po&s;&s;ibly prevented the other Sex from regarding her, notwith&s;tanding her Petticoats, in the Light of a Woman. However, as &s;he had con&s;ider|ed the Matter &s;cientifically, &s;he perfectly well knew, though &s;he had never practi&s;ed them, all the Arts which fine Ladies u&s;e when they de&s;ire to give Encourage|ment, or to conceal Liking, with all the long Ap|pendage of Smiles, Ogles, Glances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they are at pre&s;ent practi&s;ed in the Beau-monde. To &s;um the whole, no Species of Di&s;gui&s;e or Affectation had e&s;|caped her Notice; but as to the plain &s;imple Work|ings of hone&s;t Nature, as &s;he had never &s;een any &s;uch, &s;he could know but little of them.</P>
<P>By means of this wonderful Sagacity, Mrs. <HI>We&s;|tern</HI> had now, as &s;he thought, made a Di&s;covery of &s;omething in the Mind of <HI>Sophia.</HI> The fir&s;t Hint of this &s;he took from the Behaviour of the young Lady in the field of Battle; and the Su&s;picion which &s;he then conceived, was greatly corroborated by &s;ome Ob&s;ervations which &s;he had made that Evening, and
<PB N="274" REF="289">
the next Morning. However, being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a Mi&s;take, &s;he carried the Se|cret a whole Fortnight in her Bo&s;om, giving only &s;ome oblique Hints, by Simperings, Winks, Nods and now and then dropping an ob&s;cure Word, which indeed &s;ufficiently alarmed <HI>Sophia,</HI> but did not at all affect her Brother.</P>
<P>Being at length, however, thoroughly &s;atisfied of the Truth of her Ob&s;ervation, &s;he took an Opportu|nity, one Morning, when &s;he was alone with her Brother, to interrupt one of his Whi&s;tles in the fol|lowing Manner.</P>
<P>'Pray, Brother, have you not ob&s;erved &s;omething very extraordinary in my Niece lately?' 'No, not I,' an&s;wered <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> 'Is any thing the Matter with the Girl? I think there is,' replies &s;he, 'and &s;ome|thing of much Con&s;equence too.' 'Why &s;he doth not complain of any Thing', cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'and &s;he hath had the Small Pox.' 'Brother,' returned &s;he, 'Girls are liable to other Di&s;tempers be&s;ides the Small Pox, and &s;ometimes po&s;&s;ibly to much wor&s;e.' Here <HI>We&s;tern</HI> interrupted her with much Earne&s;tne&s;s, and begged her, if any thing ailed his Daughter, to ac|quaint him immediately, adding, '&s;he knew he lov|ed her more than his own Soul, and that he would &s;end to the World's End for the be&s;t Phy&s;ician to her.' 'Nay, nay, an&s;wered &s;he, &s;miling, 'the Di&s;temper is not &s;o terrible; but I believe, Brother, you are convinced I know the World, and I pro|mi&s;e you I was never more deceived in my Life, if my Niece be not mo&s;t de&s;perately in Love.' 'How! in Love,' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> in a Pa&s;&s;ion, 'in Love without acquainting me! I'll di&s;inherit her, I'll turn her out of Doors, &s;tark naked, without a Farthing. Is all my Kindne&s;s vor'ur, and vondne&s;s o'ur come to this, to fall in Love without a&s;king me Leave!' 'But you will not,' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'turn this Daughter, whom you love better than your own
<PB N="275" REF="290">
Soul, out of Doors, before you know whether you &s;hall approve her Choice. Suppo&s;e &s;he &s;hould have fixed on the very Per&s;on whom you your&s;elf would wi&s;h, I'hope you would not be angry then.' 'No, no,' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'that would make a Differ|rence. If &s;he marries the Man I would ha' her, &s;he may love whom &s;he plea&s;es, I &s;han't trouble my Head about that.' 'That is &s;poken,' an&s;wered the Si&s;ter, 'like a &s;en&s;ible Man, but I believe the very Per&s;on, &s;he hath cho&s;en, would be the very Per&s;on you would chu&s;e for her. I will di&s;|claim all Knowledge of the World if it is not &s;o; and I believe, Brother, you will allow I have &s;ome.' 'Why lookee, Si&s;ter,' &s;aid <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'I do believe you have as much as any Woman; and to be &s;ure tho&s;e are Women's Matters. You know I don't love to hear you talk about Politics, they be|long to us, and Petticoats &s;hould not meddle: But come, Who is the Man?' 'Marry!' &s;aid &s;he, 'you may find him out your&s;elf, if you plea&s;e. You who are &s;o great a Politician can be at no great Lo&s;s. The Judgment which can penetrate into the Cabinets of Princes, and di&s;cover the &s;ecret Springs which move the great State Wheels in all the political Machines of <HI>Europe,</HI> mu&s;t &s;urely, with very little Difficulty find out what pa&s;&s;es in the rude uninformed Mind of a Girl.' 'Si&s;ter,' cries the Squire, 'I have often warned you not to talk the Court Gibberi&s;h to me. I tell you, I don't under&s;tand the Lingo; but I can read a Journal, or the <HI>Lon|don Evening Po&s;t.</HI> Perhaps indeed, there may be now and tan a Ver&s;e which I can't make much of, becau&s;e half the Letters are left out; yet I know very well what is meant by that, and that our Af|fairs don't go &s;o well as they &s;hould do, becau&s;e of Bribery and Corruption. I pity your Country Ig|norance from my Heart,' cries the Lady, 'Do you?' an&s;wered <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'and I pity your Town
<PB N="276" REF="291">
Learning, I had rather be any Thing than a Cour|tier, and a Pre&s;bytcrian, and a <HI>Hanoverian</HI> too, as &s;ome People, I believe, are.' 'If you mean me,' an&s;wered &s;he, 'you know I am a Woman, Brother; and it &s;ignifies nothing what I am. Be&s;ides&mdash;I do know you are a Woman,' cries the Squire, and its well for thee, that at one; if had&s;t been a Man, I promi&s;e thee I had lent thee a <HI>Flick</HI> long a|go.' 'Ay there,' &s;aid &s;he, 'in that <HI>Flick</HI> lies all your fancied Superiority. Your Bodies, and not your Brains, are &s;tronger than ours. Believe me, it is well for you that you are able to beat us, or &s;uch is the Superiority of our Under&s;tanding, we &s;hould make all of you what the brave, and wi&s;e, and witty, and polite are already,&mdash;our Slaves.' I am glad I know your Mind,' an&s;wered the Squire, but we'll talk more of this Matter another Time. At pre&s;ent, do tell me what Man it is you mean about my Daughter.' 'Hold a Moment,' &s;aid &s;he, while I dige&s;t that &s;overeign Contempt I have for your Sex; or el&s;e I ought to be too angry with you. There&mdash;I have made a Shift to gulp it down. And now, good politic Sir, what think you of Mr. <HI>Blifil?</HI> Did &s;he not faint away on &s;eeing him lie breathle&s;s on the Ground? Did &s;he not, after he was recovered, turn pale again the Moment we came up to that Part of the Field where he &s;tood? And pray what el&s;e &s;hould be the Occa&s;ion of all her Melancholy that Night at Supper, the next Morning, and indeed ever &s;ince?' "Fore <HI>George!'</HI> cries the Squire, 'now you mind me on't, I remem|ber it all. It is certainly &s;o, and I am glad on't with all my Heart. I knew <HI>Sophy</HI> was a good Girl, and would not fall in Love to make me angry. I was never more rejoiced in my Life: For nothing can lie &s;o handy together as our two E&s;tates. I had this Matter in my Head &s;ome Time ago; for certainly the two E&s;tates are in a Manner joined
<PB N="277" REF="292">
together in Matrimony already, and it would be a thou&s;and Pities to part them. It is true indeed, there be larger E&s;tates in the Kingdom, but not in this County, and I had rather bate &s;omething, than marry my Daughter among Stangers and Foreign|ers. Be&s;ides mo&s;t o' zuch great E&s;tates be in the Hands of Lords, and I hate the very Name of <HI>them|mun.</HI> Well but, Si&s;ter, what would you advi&s;e me to do: For I tell you Women know the&s;e Matters better than we do?' 'O, your humble Servant, Sir,' an&s;wered the Lady, 'we are obliged to you for al|lowing us a Capacity in any Thing. Since you are plea&s;ed then, mo&s;t politic Sir, to a&s;k my Advice, I think you may propo&s;e the Match to <HI>Allworthy</HI> your&s;elf. There is no Indecorum in the Propo|&s;al's coming from the Parent of either Side. King <HI>Alcinous,</HI> in Mr. <HI>Pope'</HI>s Ody&s;&s;ey, offers his Daugh|ter to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> I need not caution &s;o Politic a Per|&s;on not to &s;ay that your Daughter is in Love; that would indeed be again&s;t all Rules.' 'Well,' &s;aid the Squire,' 'I will propo&s;e it; but I &s;hall certainly lend un a <HI>Flick,</HI> if he refu&s;e me.' Fear not,' cries Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'the Match is too advantageous to be refu&s;ed.' 'I don't know that,' an&s;wered the Squire, <HI>'Allworthy</HI> is a queer B&mdash;ch, and Money hath no Effect o' un.' 'Brother,' &s;aid the Lady, your Politics a&s;toni&s;h me. Are you really to be impo&s;ed on by Profe&s;&s;ions? Do you think Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> hath more Contempt for Money than other Men, becau&s;e he profe&s;&s;es more. Such Credulity would better become one of us weak Women, than that wi&s;e Sex which Heaven hath formed for Po|liticians. Indeed, Brother, you would make a fine Plenipo to negotiate with the <HI>French.</HI> They would &s;oon per&s;uade you, that they take Towns out of mere defen&s;ive Principles.' 'Si&s;ter,' an&s;wered the Squire, with much Scorn, Let your Friends at Court an&s;wer for the Towns taken; as you are a
<PB N="278" REF="293">
Woman, I &s;hall lay no Blame upon you: For I &s;uppo&s;e they are wi&s;er than to tru&s;t Women with Se|crets.' He accompanied this with &s;o &s;arca&s;tical a Laugh, that Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> could bear no longer. She had been all this Time fretted in a tender Part (for &s;he was indeed very deeply &s;killed in the&s;e Mat|ters, and very violent in them) and therefore bur&s;t forth in a Rage, declared her Brother to be both a Clown and a Blockhead, and that &s;he would &s;tay no longer in his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Squire, tho' perhaps, he had never read <HI>Ma|chiavel,</HI> was, however, in many Points, a perfect Politician. He &s;trongly held all tho&s;e wi&s;e Tenets, which are &s;o well inculcated in that Politico-Peripa|tetic School of <HI>Exchange-Alley.</HI> He knew the ju&s;t Value and only U&s;e of Meney, <HI>viz.</HI> to lay it up. He was likewi&s;e well &s;killed in the exact Value of Rever|&s;ions, Expectations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and had often con&s;idered the Amount of his Si&s;ter's Fortune, and the Chance which he or his Po&s;terity had of inheriting it. This he was infinitely too wi&s;e to &s;acrifice to a trifling Re&s;entment. When he found, therefore, he had carried Matters too far, he began to think of reconciling them; which was no very difficult Ta&s;k, as the Lady had great Affection for her Brother, and &s;till greater for her Niece; and tho' too &s;u&s;ceptible of an Affront offered to her Skill in Politics, on which &s;he much valued her&s;elf, was a Woman of a very extraordinary good and &s;weet Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Having fir&s;t, therefore, laid violent Hands on the Hor&s;es, for who&s;e E&s;cape from the Stable no Place but the Window was left open; he next applied him&s;elf to his Si&s;ter, &s;oftened and &s;oothed her, by un&s;aying all he had &s;aid, and by A&s;&s;ertions directly contrary to tho&s;e which had incen&s;ed her. La&s;tly, he &s;um|moned the Eloquence of <HI>Sophia</HI> to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who, be&s;ides a mo&s;t graceful and winning Addre&s;s, had the Advantage of being heard with great Favour and Partiality by her Aunt.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="294">
The Re&s;ult of the whole was a kind Smile from Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who &s;aid, 'Brother, you are ab&s;o|lutely a perfect <HI>Croat:</HI> but as tho&s;e have their U&s;e in the Army of the Empre&s;s Queen, &s;o you like|wi&s;e have &s;ome good in you. I will therefore once more &s;ign a Treaty of Peace with you, and &s;ee that you do not infringe it on your Side; at lea&s;t, as you are &s;o excellent a Politician, I may expect you will keep your Leagues like the <HI>French,</HI> till your Intere&s;t calls upon you to break them.'</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing two Defiances to the Critics.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Squire having &s;ettled Matters with his Si&s;|ter, as we have &s;een in the la&s;t Chapter, was &s;o greatly impatient to communicate the Propo&s;al to <HI>Allworthy,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had the utmo&s;t Dif|ficulty to prevent him from vi&s;iting that Gentleman in his Sickne&s;s, for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had been engaged to dine with Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> at the Time when he was taken ill. He was, therefore, no &s;ooner di&s;charged out of the Cu&s;tody of Phy&s;ic, but he thought (as was u&s;ual with him on all Occa&s;ions, both the highe&s;t and the lowe&s;t) of ful|filling his Engagement.</P>
<P>In the Interval between the Time of the Dialogue in the la&s;t Chapter, and this Day of public Entertain|ment, <HI>Sophia</HI> had, from certain ob&s;cure Hints thrown out by her Aunt, collected &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions that the &s;agacious Lady &s;u&s;pected her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Jones.</HI> She now re&s;olved to take this Opportunity of wiping out all &s;uch Su&s;picion, and for that Purpo&s;e to put an entire Con&s;traint on her Behaviour.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, &s;he endeavoured to conceal a throbbing me|lancholy Heart with the utmo&s;t Sprightline&s;s in her Countenance, and the highe&s;t Gayety in her Man|ner.
<PB N="280" REF="295">
Secondly, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her whole Di&s;cour&s;e to Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and took not the lea&s;t Notice of poor <HI>Jones</HI> the whole Day.</P>
<P>The Squire was &s;o delighted with the Conduct of his Daughter, that he &s;carce eat any Dinner, and &s;pent almo&s;t his whole Time in watching Opportuni|ties of conveying Signs of his Approbation by Winks and Nods to his Si&s;ter; who was not at fir&s;t altoge|ther &s;o plea&s;ed with what &s;he &s;aw as was her Bro|ther.</P>
<P>In &s;hort <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;o greatly overacted her Part, that her Aunt was at fir&s;t &s;taggered, and began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome Affectation in her Niece; but as &s;he was her|&s;elf a Woman of Great Art, &s;o &s;he &s;oon attributed this to extreme Art in <HI>Sophia.</HI> She remembered the many Hints &s;he had given her Neice concerning her being in Love, and imagined the young Lady had taken this Way to rally her out of her Opinion, by an overacted Civility; a Notion that was corrobo|rated by the exce&s;&s;ive Gaiety with which the whole was accompanied. We cannot here avoid remark|ing that this Conjecture would have been better found|ed, had <HI>Sophia</HI> lived ten Years in the Air of <HI>Gro&s;ve|nor &s;quare,</HI> where young Ladies do learn a wonder|ful Knack of rallying and playing with that Pa&s;&s;ion, which is a mighty &s;erious Thing in the Woods and Groves a hundred Miles Di&s;tant from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, in di&s;covering the Deceit of others, it matters much that our own Art be wound up, if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, in the &s;ame Key with theirs: For very artful Men &s;ometimes mi&s;car|ry by fancying others wi&s;er, or in other Words, great|er Knaves than they really are. As this Ob&s;ervation is pretty deep, I will illu&s;trate it by the following &s;hort Story. Three Countrymen were pur&s;uing a <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> Thief through <HI>Brentford.</HI> The &s;imple&s;t of them &s;eeing the <HI>Wilt&s;hire Hou&s;e</HI> written under a Sign, advi&s;ed his Companions to enter it, for there
<PB N="281" REF="296">
mo&s;t probably they would find their Countryman. The &s;econd, who was wi&s;er, laughed at this Sim|plicity; but the third, who was wi&s;er &s;till, an&s;wered, 'Let us go in, however, for he may think we &s;hould not &s;u&s;pect him of going among&s;t his own Coun|trymen.' They accordingly went in and &s;earch|ed the Hou&s;e, and by that Means mi&s;&s;ed overtaking the Thief, who was, at that Time, but a little ways before them; and who, as they all knew, but had never once reflected, could not read.</P>
<P>The Reader will pardon a Digre&s;&s;ion in which &s;o invaluable a Secret is communicated, &s;ince every Game&s;ter will agree how nece&s;&s;ary it is to know ex|actly the Play of another, in order to countermine him. This will, moreover, afford a Rea&s;on why the wi&s;er Man, as is often &s;een, is the Bubble of the weaker, and why many &s;imple and innocent Charac|ters are &s;o generally mi&s;under&s;tood and mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed; but what is mo&s;t material, this will account for the Deceit which <HI>Sophia</HI> put on her politic Aunt.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, and the Company retired into the Garden, Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who was thoroughly con|vinced of the certainty of what his Si&s;ter had told him, took Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> a&s;ide, and very bluntly propo&s;ed a Match between <HI>Sophia</HI> and young Mr. <HI>Blifil.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was not one of tho&s;e Men, who&s;e Hearts flutter at any unexpected and &s;udden Tidings of worldly profit. His Mind was, indeed, tempered with that Philo&s;ophy which becomes a Man and a Chri&s;tian. He affected no ab&s;olute Superiority to all Plea&s;ure and Pain, to all Joy and Grief; but was not at the &s;ame time to be di&s;compo&s;ed and ruffled by every accidental Bla&s;t; by every Smile or Frown of Fortune. He received therefore, Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Pro|po&s;al without any vi&s;ible Emotion, or without any Alteration of Countenance. He &s;aid, the Alliance was &s;uch as he &s;incerely wi&s;hed; then launched forth
<PB N="282" REF="297">
into a very ju&s;t Encomium on the young Lady's Me|rit; acknowledged the Offer to be advantageous in Point of Fortune; and after thanking Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> for the good Opinion he had profe&s;s'd of his Nephew, concluded, that if the young People liked each other, he &s;hould be very de&s;irous to complete the Affair.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tern</HI> was a little di&s;appointed at Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s An&s;wer; which was not &s;o warm as he expected. He treated the Doubt whether the young People might like one another with great Contempt; &s;aying, 'That Parents were the be&s;t Judges of proper Matches for their Children; that, for his Part, he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on the mo&s;t re&s;igned Obedience from his Daughter; and if any young Fellow could re|fu&s;e &s;uch a Bedfellow, he was his humble Servant, and hoped there was no Harm done.'</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> endeavoured to &s;often this Re&s;entment by many <HI>Elogium'</HI>s on <HI>Sophia;</HI> declaring, he had no doubt but that Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> would very gladly receive the Offer; but all was ineffectual, he could obtain no other An&s;wer from the Squire but&mdash;'I &s;ay no more&mdash;I humbly Hope there's no Harm done&mdash;that's all.' Which Words he repeated, at lea&s;t, a hundred Times before they parted.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was too well acquainted with his Neigh|bour to be offended at this Behaviour; and tho' he was &s;o aver&s;e to the Rigour which &s;ome Parents ex|erci&s;e on their Children in the Article of Marriage, that he had re&s;olved never to force his Nephew's In|clinations, he was neverthele&s;s much plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of this Union: For the whole Country re|&s;ounded the prai&s;es of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and he had him&s;elf great|ly admired the uncommon Endowments of both her Mind and Per&s;on. To which, I believe we may add, the Con&s;ideration of her va&s;t Fortune, which, tho' he was too &s;ober to be intoxicated with, he was too &s;en&s;ible to de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="298">
And here, in Defiance of all the barking Critics in the World, I mu&s;t and will introduce a Digre&s;&s;ion concerning true Wi&s;dom, of which Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was in Reality as great a Pattern as he was of Good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>True Wi&s;dom then, notwith&s;tanding all which Mr. <HI>Hogarth'</HI>s poor Poet may have writ again&s;t Riches, and in Spite of all which any rich, well-fed Divine may have preached again&s;t Plea&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ts not in the con|tempt of either of the&s;e. A Man may have as much Wi&s;dom in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an affluent Fortune, as any Beggar in the Streets; or may enjoy a hand&s;ome Wife or a hearty Friend, and &s;till remain as wi&s;e as any &s;our Popi&s;h Reclu&s;e, who buries all his &s;ocial Facul|ties, and &s;tarves his Belly while he well la&s;hes his Back.</P>
<P>To &s;ay Truth, the wi&s;e&s;t Man is the likelie&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s all worldly Ble&s;&s;ings in an eminent Degree: For as that Moderation which Wi&s;dom pre&s;cribes is the &s;ure&s;t Way to u&s;eful Wealth; &s;o can it alone qualify us to ta&s;te many Plea&s;ures. The wi&s;e Man gratifies every Appetite and every Pa&s;&s;ion, while the Fool &s;acrifices all the re&s;t to pall and &s;atiate one.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that very wi&s;e Men have been notoriou&s;ly avaricious. I an&s;wer, not in that In|&s;tance. It may likewi&s;e be &s;aid, that the wi&s;e&s;t Men have been in their Youth, immoderately fond of Plea&s;ure. I an&s;wer they were not wi&s;e then.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom in &s;hort, who&s;e Le&s;&s;ons have been re|pre&s;ented as &s;o hard to learn by tho&s;e who never were at her School, teaches us only to extend a &s;imple Maxim univer&s;ally known and followed even in the lowe&s;t Life, a little farther than that Life carries it. And this is not to buy at too dear a Price.</P>
<P>Now, whoever takes this Maxim abroad with him into the grand Market of the World, and con|&s;tantly applies it to Honours, to Riches, to plea&s;ures, and to every other Commodity which that Market affords, is, I will venture to affirm, a wi&s;e Man; and
<PB N="284" REF="299">
mu&s;t be &s;o acknowledged in the worldly Sen&s;e of the Word: For he makes the be&s;t of Bargains, &s;ince in Reality he purcha&s;es every Thing at the Price only of a little Trouble, and carries home all the good Things I have mentioned, while he keeps his Health, his Inno|cence, and his Reputation, the common Prices which are paid for them by others, entire and to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>From this Moderation, likewi&s;e, he learns two other Le&s;&s;ons, which complete his Character. Fir&s;t, ne|ver to be intoxicated when he hath made the be&s;t Bargain, nor dejected when the Market is empty, or when its Commodities are too dear for his Pur|cha&s;e.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t remember on what Subject I am writ|ing, and not tre&s;pa&s;s too far on the Patience of a good-natured Critic. Here therefore I put an End to the Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Containing &s;undry curious Matters.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> returned home, he took Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> apart, and after &s;ome Preface, communicated to him the Propo&s;al which had been made by Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and, at the &s;ame Time, in|formed him how agreeable this Match would be to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Charms of <HI>Sophia</HI> had not made the lea&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ion on <HI>Blifil;</HI> not that his Heart was pre-enga|ged; neither was he totally in&s;en&s;ible of Beauty, or had any Aver&s;ion to Women; but his Appetites were, by Nature, &s;o moderate, that he was ea&s;ily able by Philo&s;ophy, or by Study, or by &s;ome other Method, to &s;ubdue them; and as to that Pa&s;&s;ion which we have treated of in the fir&s;t Chapter of this Book, he had not the lea&s;t Tincture of it in his whole Com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="300">
But tho' he was &s;o entirely free from that mixed Pa&s;&s;ion, of which we there treated, and of which the Virtues and Beauty of <HI>Sophia</HI> formed &s;o notable an Object; yet was he altogether as well furni&s;hed with &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ions, that promi&s;ed them&s;elves very full gratification in the young Lady's Fortune. Such were Avarice and Ambition, which divided the Do|minion of his Mind between them. He had more than once con&s;idered the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Fortune as a very de&s;irable Thing, and had entertained &s;ome di&s;tant Views concerning it: But his own Youth and that of the young Lady, and indeed principally a Re|flection that Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> might marry again, and have more Children, had re&s;trained him from too ha&s;ty or eager a Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>This la&s;t and mo&s;t material Objection was now in great Mea&s;ure removed, as the Propo&s;al came from Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> him&s;elf. <HI>Blifil</HI> therefore after a very &s;hort He&s;itation, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> that Ma|trimony was a Subject on which he had not yet thought: But that he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his friendly and fatherly Care, that he &s;hould in all Things &s;ubmit him&s;elf to his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was naturally a Man of Spirit, and his pre&s;ent Gravity aro&s;e from true Wi&s;dom and Philo|&s;ophy, not from any original Phlegm in his Di&s;po&s;i|tion: For he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much Fire in his Youth, and had married a beautiful Woman for Love. He was not, therefore, greatly plea&s;ed with this cold An|&s;wer of his Nephew; nor could he help launching forth into the Prai&s;es of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Wonder that the Heart of a young Man could be im|pregnable to the force of &s;uch Charms, unle&s;s it was guarded by &s;ome prior Affection.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> a&s;&s;ured him he had no &s;uch Guard; and then proceeded to di&s;cour&s;e &s;o wi&s;ely and religiou&s;ly on Love and Marriage, that he would have &s;topt the Mouth of a Parent much le&s;s devoutly inclined than
<PB N="286" REF="301">
was his Uncle. In the End, the good Man was &s;a|tisfied, that his Nephew, far from having any Ob|jections to <HI>Sophia,</HI> had that E&s;teem for her, which in &s;ober and virtuous Minds is the &s;ure Foundation of Friend&s;hip and Love. And as he doubted not but the Lover would, in a little Time, become altogether as agreeable to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he fore&s;aw great Happine&s;s ari&s;ing to all Parties by &s;o proper and de&s;irable a Uni|on. With Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Con&s;ent, therefore, he wrote the next Morning to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> acquainting him that his Nephew had very thankfully and gladly received the Propo&s;al, and would be ready to wait on the young Lady, whenever &s;he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to ac|cept his Vi&s;it.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tern</HI> was much plea&s;ed with this Letter, and im|mediately returned an An&s;wer; in which, without having mentioned a Word to his Daughter, he ap|pointed that very Afternoon for opening the Scene of Court&s;hip.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had di&s;patched this Me&s;&s;enger, he went in Que&s;t of his Si&s;ter, whom he found reading and expounding the Gazette to Par&s;on <HI>Supple.</HI> To this Expo&s;ition he was obliged to attend near a Quarter of an Hour, tho' with great Violence to his natural Impetuo&s;ity, before he was &s;uffered to &s;peak. At length, however, he found an Opportunity of ac|quainting the Lady, that he had Bu&s;ine&s;s of great Con&s;equence to impart to her; to which &s;he an&s;wered, 'Brother, I am entirely at your Service. Things look &s;o well in the North that I was never in a better Humour.'</P>
<P>The Par&s;on then withdrawing, <HI>We&s;tern</HI> acquaint|ed her with all which had pa&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ired her to communicate the Affair to <HI>Sophia,</HI> which &s;he readily and chearfully undertook; tho' perhaps her Brother was a little obliged to that agreeable Northern A&s;pect which had &s;o delighted her, that he heard no Comment

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In which is related what pa&s;&s;ed between</HI> Sophia <HI>and her Aunt.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>SOPHIA</HI> was in her Chamber reading when her Aunt came in. The Moment &s;he &s;aw Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> &s;he &s;hut the Book with &s;o much Eagerne&s;s, that the good Lady could not forbear a&s;king her, What Book that was which &s;he &s;eemed &s;o much afraid of &s;hewing. 'Upon my Word, Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'it is a Book which I am neither a&s;hamed nor afraid to own I have read. It is the Production of a young Lady of Fa&s;hion, who&s;e good Under|&s;tanding, I think, doth Honour to her Sex, and who&s;e good Heart is an Honour to Human Nature.' Mrs <HI>We&s;tern</HI> then took up the Book, and immediate|ly after threw it down, &s;aying&mdash;'Yes, the Author is of a very good Family; but &s;he is not much a|mong People one knows. I have never read it; for the be&s;t Judges &s;ay, there is not much in it.'' I dare not, Madam, &s;et up my own Opinion, &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'again&s;t the be&s;t Judges; but there ap|pears to me a great deal of human Nature it; and in many Parts, &s;o much true Tenderne&s;s and Deli|cacy, that it hath co&s;t me many a Tear.' 'Ay, and do you love to cry then?' &s;ays the Aunt. 'I love a tender Sen&s;ation,' an&s;wered the Niece, and would pay the Price of a Tear for it at any Time.' Well, but &s;hew me,' &s;aid the Aunt, 'what you was reading when I came in; there was &s;ome|thing very tender in that, I believe, and very loving too.' You blu&s;h, my dear <HI>Sophia.</HI> Ah! Child, you &s;hould read Books, which would teach you a little Hypocri&s;y, which would in&s;truct you how to hide your Thoughts a little better.' 'I hope, Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'I have no Thoughts which I ought
<PB N="288" REF="303">
to be a&s;hamed of di&s;covering.' 'A&s;hamed! no,' cries the Aunt, 'I don't think you have any Thoughts which you ought to be a&s;hamed of, and yet, Child, you blu&s;hed ju&s;t now when I mentioned the Word <HI>Loving.</HI> Dear <HI>Sophy,</HI> be a&s;&s;ured you have not one Thought which I am not well acquainted with; as well, Child, as the <HI>French</HI> are with our Motions, long before we put them in Execution. Did you think, Child, becau&s;e you have been able to impo&s;e upon your Father, that you could impo&s;e upon me? Do you imagine I did not know the Rea&s;on of your over-acting all that Friend&s;hip for Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> ye&s;|terday? I have &s;een a little too much of the World, to be &s;o deceived. Nay, nay, do not blu&s;h again. I tell you it is a Pa&s;&s;ion you need not be a&s;hamed of.&mdash;It is a Pa&s;&s;ion I my&s;elf approve, and have al|ready brought your Father into the Approbation of. Indeed, I &s;olely con&s;ider your Inclination; for I would always have that gratified, if po&s;&s;ible, though one may &s;acrifice higher Pro&s;pects. Come, I have News which will delight your very Soul. Make me your Confident, and I will undertake you &s;hall be happy to the very Extent of your Wi&s;hes.' 'La, Madam,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> looking more fooli&s;hly than ever &s;he did in her Life, 'I know not what to &s;ay&mdash;Why, Madam, &s;hould you &s;u&s;pect?'&mdash;'Nay, no Di&s;hone&s;ty,' returned Mr. <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> 'Con&s;i|der, you are &s;peaking to one of your own Sex, to an Aunt, and I hope you are convinced you &s;peak to a Friend. Con&s;ider, you are only revealing to me what I know already, and what I plainly &s;aw ye&s;terday, through that mo&s;t artful of all Di&s;gui&s;es, which you had put on, and which mu&s;t have de|ceived any one who had not perfectly known the World. La&s;tly con&s;ider it is a Pa&s;&s;ion which I highly approve.' 'La, Madam,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'you come upon one &s;o unawares, and on a &s;udden. To be &s;ure, Madam, I am not blind&mdash;and cer|tainly

'My Father, this Afternoon!' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> with the Blood &s;tarting from her Face.&mdash;'Yes, Child,' &s;aid the Aunt, 'this Afternoon. You know the Impetuo&s;ity of my Brother's Temper. I acquainted him with the Pa&s;|&s;ion which I fir&s;t di&s;covered in you that Evening when you fainted away in the Field. I &s;aw it in your Fainting. I &s;aw it immediately upon your Recovery. I &s;aw it that Evening at Supper, and the next Morning at Breakfa&s;t: (you know, Child, I have &s;een the World). Well, I no &s;ooner ac|quainted my Brother; but he immediately wanted to propo&s;e it to <HI>Allworthy.</HI> He propo&s;ed it Ye&s;terday, <HI>Allworthy</HI> con&s;ented, (as to be &s;ure he mu&s;t with Joy) and this Afternoon, I tell you, you are to put on all your be&s;t Airs.' This Afternoon!' cries <HI>Sophia.</HI> 'Dear Aunt, you frighten me out of my Sen&s;es.' 'O, my Dear,' &s;aid the Aunt, 'you will &s;oon come to your&s;elf again; for he is a charming young Fellow, that's the Truth on't.' 'Nay, I will own,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> I know none with &s;uch Per|fections. So brave, and yet &s;o gentle; &s;o witty, yet &s;o inoffen&s;ive, &s;o humane, &s;o civil, &s;o genteel, &s;o hand&s;ome! What &s;ignifies his being ba&s;e born, when compared with &s;uch Qualifications as the&s;e?' Ba&s;e born! what do you mean,' &s;aid the Aunt, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> ba&s;e born!' <HI>Sophia</HI> turned in&s;tantly pale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t this Name, and faintly repeated it. Upon which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Aunt cried, 'Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> ay Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> of whom el&s;e have we been talking?' 'Good Heaven,' an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> ready to &s;ink, 'of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I thought; I am &s;ure I know no other who de&s;erves&mdash;' 'I prote&s;t,' cries the Aunt, 'you frighten
<PB N="290" REF="305">
me in your Turn. Is it Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and not Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who is the Object of your Affection?' 'Mr. <HI>Blifil!'</HI> repeated <HI>Sophia.</HI> 'Sure it is impo&s;&s;ible you can be in earne&s;t; if you are, I am the mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable Woman alive.' Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> now &s;tood a few Moments &s;ilent, while Sparks of fiery Rage fla&s;h|ed from her Eyes. At length, collecting all her Force of Voice, &s;he thundered forth in the following articulate Sounds:</P>
<P>'And is it po&s;&s;ible you can think of di&s;gracing your Family by allying your&s;elf to a Ba&s;tard? Can the Blood of the <HI>We&s;terns</HI> &s;ubmit to &s;uch Contami|nation! If you have not Sen&s;e &s;ufficient to re&s;train &s;uch mon&s;trous Inclinations, I thought the Pride of our Family would have prevented you from giving' the lea&s;t Encouragement to &s;o ba&s;e an Affection; 'much le&s;s did I imagine you would ever have had the A&s;&s;urance to own it to my Face.'</P>
<P>'Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> trembling, 'what I have &s;aid you have extorted from me. I do not remember to have ever mentioned the Name of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> with Approbation, to any one before; nor &s;hould I now, had I not conceived he had had your Approbation. Whatever were my Thoughts of that poor unhappy young Man, I intended to have carried them with me to my Grave&mdash;To that Grave where now, I find, I am only to &s;eek Re|po&s;e.'&mdash;Here &s;he &s;unk down in her Chair, drown|ed in her Tears, and, in all the moving Silence of unutterable Grief, pre&s;ented a Spectacle which mu&s;t have affected almo&s;t the harde&s;t Heart.</P>
<P>All this tender Sorrow, however, rai&s;ed no Com|pa&s;&s;ion in her Aunt. On the contrary, &s;he now fell into the mo&s;t violent Rage&mdash;'And I would rather', &s;he cried, in a mo&s;t vehement Voice, 'follow you to your Grave, than I would &s;ee you di&s;grace your|&s;elf and your Family by &s;uch a Match. O Hea|vens! could I have ever &s;u&s;pected that I &s;hould live

to hear a Niece of mine declare a Pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch a Fellow?

A Family &s;o not|ed' for the Prudence of its Women,&mdash;Here &s;he run on a full Quarter of an Hour, till having exhau&s;t|ed her Breath rather than her Rage, &s;he concluded with threatening to go immediately and acquaint her Brother.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> then threw her&s;elf at her Feet, and laying hold of her Hands. 'begged her, with Tears, to conceal what &s;he had drawn from her; urging the Violence of her Father's Temper, and prote&s;ting that no Inclinations of hers &s;hould ever prevail with her to do any thing which might offend him.'</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;tood a Moment looking at her, and then having recollected her&s;elf, &s;aid, that 'on one Con&s;ideration only &s;he would keep the Secret from her Brother; and this was, that <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;hould pro|mi&s;e to entertain Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> that very Afternoon as her Lover, and to regard him as the Per&s;on who was to be her Hu&s;band.'</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Sophia</HI> was too much in her Aunt's Power to deny her any thing po&s;itively; &s;he was obliged to promi&s;e that &s;he would &s;ee Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and be as civil to him as po&s;&s;ible; but begged her Aunt that the Match might not be hurried on. She &s;aid, 'Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> was by no means agreeable to her, and &s;he hoped her Father would be prevailed on not to make her the mo&s;t wretched of Women.'</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> a&s;&s;ured her, 'that the Match was en|tirely agreed upon, and that nothing could or &s;hould prevent it.' 'I mu&s;t own,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I looked on it as on a Matter of Indifference; nay, perhaps, had &s;ome Scruples about it before, which were ac|tually got over by my thinking it highly agreeable to your own Inclinations; but now I regard it as the mo&s;t eligible Thing in the World; nor &s;hall there
<PB N="292" REF="307">
be, if I can prevent it, a Moment of Time lo&s;t on the Occa&s;ion.'</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> replied, 'Delay at lea&s;t, Madam, I may expect from both your Goodne&s;s and my Father's. Surely you will give me Time to endeavour to get the better of &s;o &s;trong a Di&s;inclination as I have at pre&s;ent to this Per&s;on.'</P>
<P>The Aunt an&s;wered, 'She knew too much of the World to be &s;o deceived; that as &s;he was &s;en&s;ible another Man had her Affections, &s;he would per|&s;uade Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> to ha&s;ten the Match as much as po&s;&s;ible. It would be bad Politics indeed, added &s;he, to protract a Siege when the Enemy's Army is at Hand, and in Danger of relieving it. No, no, <HI>Sophy,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, as I am convinced you have a vio|lent Pa&s;&s;ion, which you can never &s;atisfy with Ho|nour, I will do all I can to put your Honour out of the Care of your Family: For when you are married tho&s;e Matters will belong only to the Con&s;ideration of your Hu&s;band.

<P><HI>Sophia</HI> well under&s;tood what her Aunt menat; but did not think proper to make her an An&s;wer.

In|deed, to confe&s;s the Truth, &s;he knew it already, and therefore was not very inqui&s;itive as to that Point. She then proceeded thus: 'I don't pretend to give

your La'&s;hip Advice, <HI>whereof</HI> your La'&s;hip knows much better than I can pretend to, being but a Ser|vant; but i-fackins! no Father in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould marry me again&s;t my Con&s;ent.

And if your La'&s;hip would but give me Leave to tell my Ma&s;ter &s;o&mdash;To be &s;ure, it would be more properer to come from your own Mouth; but as your La'&s;hip doth not care to foul your Tongue with his na&s;ty Name.' 'You are mi&s;taken, <HI>Honour,'</HI> &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'my Father was determined before he ever thought fit to mention it to me.' 'More Shame for him,' cries <HI>Honour,</HI> 'you are to go to Bed to him, and not Ma&s;ter. And thof a Man may be a very proper Man, yet every Woman mayn't think him hand&s;ome alike.

I wi&s;h &s;ome People would trouble them&s;elves only with what belongs to them; they would not, I believe, like to be &s;erved &s;o, if it was their own Ca&s;e: For tho' I am a Maid, I can ea&s;ily believe as how all Men are not equally agreeable. And what &s;ignifies your La'&s;hip having &s;o great a Fortune, if you can't plea&s;e your&s;elf with the Man you think mo&s;t hand|&s;ome&s;t? Well, I &s;ay nothing, but to be &s;ure it is Pity &s;ome Folks had not been better born; nay, as for that Matter, I &s;hould not mind it my &s;elf: But then there is not &s;o much Money, and what of that, your La'&s;hip hath Money enough for both; and where can your La'&s;hip be&s;tow your Fortune bet|ter?

'What do you mean by running on in this Manner to me?' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> with a very grave Countenance. 'Have I ever giv|en any Encouragement for the&s;e Liberties? Nay,

<P><HI>Jones</HI> had been there, as Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had told her: He had indeed &s;pent two Hours there that Morning

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A Picture of formal Court&s;hip in Miniature, as it al|ways ought to be drawn, and a Scene of a tenderer Kind, painted at full Length.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was well remarked by one, (and perhaps by more) that Misfortunes do not come &s;ingle. This wi&s;e Maxim was now verified by <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was not only di&s;appointed of &s;eeing the Man &s;he loved; but had the Vexation of being obliged to dre&s;s her&s;elf out, in order to receive a Vi&s;it from the Man &s;he hated.</P>
<P>That Afternoon, Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> for the fir&s;t Time, acquainted his Daughter with his Intention; telling her, he knew very well that &s;he had heard it before from her Aunt. <HI>Sophia</HI> looked very grave upon this, nor could &s;he prevent a few Pearls from &s;tealing into her Eyes. 'Come, come,' &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'none of your Maideni&s;h Airs; I know all; I a&s;&s;ure you,' Si&s;ter hath told me all.'</P>
<P>'Is it po&s;&s;ible,' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'that my Aunt can have betrayed me already?' 'Ay, ay,' &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> betrayed you! ay. Why, you betrayed your&s;elf ye&s;terday at Dinner. You &s;hewed your Fancy ve|ry plainly, I think. But you young Girls never know what you would be at. So you cry becau&s;e I am going to marry you to the Man you are in
<PB N="297" REF="312">
Love with! Your Mother, I remember, whimper|ed and whined ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner; but it was all over within twenty-four Hours after we were married: Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> is a bri&s;k young Man, and will &s;oon put an End to your Squeami&s;hne&s;s. Come, chear up, chear up, I expect un every Minute.'</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> was now convinced that her Aunt had be|haved honourably to her; and &s;he determined to go through that di&s;agreeable Afternoon with as much Re&s;olution as po&s;&s;ible, and without giving the lea&s;t Su&s;picion in the World to her Father.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> &s;oon arrived; and Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;oon af|ter withdrawing, left the young Couple together.</P>
<P>Here a long Silence of near a Quarter of an Hour en&s;ued: For the Gentleman who was to begin the Conver&s;ation had all that unbecoming Mode&s;ty which con&s;i&s;ts in Ba&s;hfulne&s;s. He often attempted to &s;peak, and as often &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his Words ju&s;t at the very Point of Utterance. At la&s;t out they broke in a Torrent of far-fetched and high-&s;trained Com|pliments, which were an&s;wered, on her Side, by downca&s;t Looks, half Bows and civil Mono&s;yl|lables. <HI>Blifil</HI> from his Inexperience in the Ways of Women, and from his Conceit of him&s;elf, took this Behaviour for a mode&s;t A&s;&s;ent to his Court&s;hip; and when to &s;horten a Scene which &s;he could no longer &s;upport, <HI>Sophia</HI> ro&s;e up and left the Room, he im|puted that too, merely to Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and comfort|ed him&s;elf, that he &s;hould have enough of her Com|pany.</P>
<P>He was indeed perfectly well &s;atisfied with his pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s: For as to that entire and ab&s;o|lute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, which romantic Lovers require, the very Idea of it never entered his Head. Her Fortune and Per&s;on were the &s;ole Object of his Wi&s;hes, of which he made no Doubt &s;oon to obtain the ab&s;olute Property; as Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Mind was &s;o earne&s;tly bent on the Match;
<PB N="298" REF="313">
and as he well knew the &s;trict Obedience which <HI>So|phia</HI> was always ready to pay to her Father's Will, and the greater &s;till which her Father would exact, if there was Occa&s;ion. This Authority, therefore, to|gether with the Charms which he fancied in his own Per&s;on and Conver&s;ation, could not fail, he thought, of &s;ucceeding with a young Lady, who&s;e Inclinations, were, he doubted not, entirely di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Jones</HI> he certainly had not even the lea&s;t Jea|lou&s;y; and I have often thought it wonderful that he had not. Perhaps he imagined the Character which <HI>Jones</HI> bore all over the Country, (how ju&s;tly let the Reader determine) of being one of the wilde&s;t Fel|lows in <HI>England,</HI> might render him odious to a Lady of the mo&s;t exemplary Mode&s;ty. Perhaps his Su&s;|picions might be laid a&s;leep by the Behaviour of <HI>So|phia,</HI> and of <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf, when they were all in Company together. La&s;tly, and indeed principally, he was well a&s;&s;ured there was not another Self in the Ca&s;e. He fancied that he knew <HI>Jones</HI> at the Bottom, and had in Reality a great Contempt for his Under|&s;tanding, for not being more attached to his own In|tere&s;t. He had no Apprehen&s;ion that <HI>Jones</HI> was in Love with <HI>Sophia;</HI> and as for any lucrative Motives, he imagined they would &s;way very little with &s;o &s;illy a Fellow. <HI>Blifil,</HI> moreover, thought the Affair of <HI>Molly Seagrim</HI> &s;till went on, and indeed believed it would end in Marriage: For <HI>Jones</HI> really loved him from his Childhood, and kept no Secret from him, till his Behaviour on the Sickne&s;s of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had entirely alienated his Heart; and it was by means of the Quarrel which had en&s;ued on this Occa&s;ion, and which was not yet reconciled, that Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> knew nothing of the Alteration which had happened in the Affection which <HI>Jones</HI> had formerly bore to|wards <HI>Molly.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e Rea&s;ons, therefore, Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> &s;aw no Far to his Succe&s;s with <HI>Sophia.</HI> He concluded, her
<PB N="299" REF="314">
Behaviour was like that of all other young Ladies on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t vi&s;it from a Lover, and it had indeed entirely an&s;wered his Expectations.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> took Care to way-lay the Lover at his Exit from his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He found him&s;elf &s;o e|levated with his Succe&s;s, &s;o enamoured with his Daughter, and &s;o &s;atisfied with her Reception of him, that the old Gentleman began to caper and dance a|bout his Hall, and by many other antic Actions, to expre&s;s the Extravagance of his Joy: For he had not the lea&s;t Command over any of his Pa&s;&s;ions; and that which had at any Time the A&s;cendant in his Mind, hurried him to the wilde&s;t Exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Blifil</HI> was departed, which was not till after many hearty Ki&s;&s;es and embraces be&s;towed on him by <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> the good Squire went in Que&s;t of his Daughter, whom he no &s;ooner found than he poured forth the mo&s;t Extravagant Raptures, bid|ding her chu&s;e what Clothes and Jewels &s;he plea&s;ed; and declaring that he had no other U&s;e for Fortune but to make her happy. He then care&s;&s;ed her again and again with the utmo&s;t Profu&s;ion of Fondne&s;s, called her by the mo&s;t endearing Names, and pro|te&s;ted &s;he was his only Joy on Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> perceiving her Father in this Fit of Affec|tion, which &s;he did not ab&s;olutely know the Rea&s;on of (for Fits of Fondne&s;s were not unu&s;ual to him, tho' this was rather more violent than ordinary) thought &s;he &s;hould never have a better Opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing her&s;elf than at pre&s;ent; as far at lea&s;t, as re|garded Mr. <HI>Blifil;</HI> and &s;he too well fore&s;aw the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity which &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be under of coming to a full Explanation. After having thanked the Squire, therefore for all his Profe&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s, &s;he ad|ded, with a Look full of inexpre&s;&s;ible Softne&s;s, 'And is it po&s;&s;ible my Papa can be &s;o good to place all his Joy in his <HI>Sophy'</HI>s Happine&s;s?' which <HI>We&s;tern</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="315">
having confirmed by a great Oath, and a Ki&s;s; &s;he then laid hold of his Hand, and falling on her Knees, after many warm and pa&s;&s;ionate Declarations of Af|fection and Duty, &s;he begged him 'not to make her the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Creature on Earth, by forc|ing her to marry a Man whom &s;he dete&s;ted. This I entreat of you, dear Sir,' &s;aid &s;he, 'for your Sake as well as my own, &s;ince you are &s;o very kind to tell me your Happine&s;s depends on mine.' How! what!' &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> &s;taring wildly.' 'O Sir,' continued &s;he, 'not only your poor <HI>Sophy'</HI>s Happine&s;s; her very Life, her Being depends up|on your granting her Reque&s;t. I cannot live with Mr. <HI>Blifil.</HI> To force me into this Marriage, would be killing me.' 'You can't live with Mr. <HI>Blifil!'</HI> &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> 'No, upon my Soul I can't, an|&s;wered <HI>Sophia.</HI> Then die and be d&mdash;ned,' cries he, &s;purning her from him. 'Oh! Sir,' cries <HI>So|phia,</HI> catching hold of the Skirt of his Coat, 'take Pity on me, I be&s;eech you. Don't look and &s;ay &s;uch cruel&mdash;Can you be unmoved while you &s;ee your <HI>Sophy</HI> in this dreadful Condition? Can the be&s;t of Father's break my Heart? Will he kill me by the mo&s;t painful, cruel, lingering Death?' Pooh! Pooh!' cries the Squire, all Stuff and Non&s;en&s;e, all Maideni&s;h Tricks. Kill you indeed! Will Marriage kill you?'&mdash;'Oh Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;uch a Marriage is wor&s;e than Death&mdash;He is not even indifferent, I hate and dete&s;t him.&mdash;If you dete&s;t un never &s;o much,' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'you &s;hall ha'un.' This he bound by an Oath too &s;hocking to repeat, and after many violent A&s;&s;everations, con|cluded in the&s;e Words. 'I am re&s;olved upon the Match, and unle&s;s you con&s;ent to it, I will not give you a Groat, not a &s;ingle Farthing; no, tho' I &s;aw you expiring with Famine in the Street, I would not relieve you with a Mor&s;el of Bread. This is my fixed Re&s;olution, and &s;o I leave you to

con&s;ider on it.' He then broke from her with &s;uch Violence, that her Face da&s;hed again&s;t the Floor, and he bur&s;t directly out of the Room, leaving poor <HI>Sophia</HI> pro&s;trate on the Ground.</P>
<P>When <HI>We&s;tern</HI> came into the Hall, he there found <HI>Jones;</HI> who &s;eeing his Friend looking wild, and pale, and almo&s;t Breathle&s;s, could not forbear enquiring the Rea&s;on of all the&s;e melacholy Appearances. Up|on which the Squire immediately acquainted him with the whole Matter, concluding with bitter denuncia|tions again&s;t <HI>Sophia,</HI> and very pathetic Lamentations of the Mi&s;ery of all Fathers who are &s;o unfortunate to have Daughters.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> to whom all the Re&s;olutions which had been taken in Favour of <HI>Blifil</HI> were yet a Secret, was al|mo&s;t &s;truck dead with this Relation; but recovering his Spirits a little, mere De&s;pair, as he afterwards &s;aid, in&s;pired him to mention a Matter to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> which &s;eemed to require more impudence than a human Forehead was ever gifted with. He de&s;ired Leave to go to <HI>Sophia,</HI> that he might endeavour to obtain her Concurrence with her Father's Inclina|tions.</P>
<P>If the Squire had been as quick-&s;ighted, as he was remarkable for the contrary, Pa&s;&s;ion might at pre&s;ent very well have blinded him. He thanked <HI>Jones</HI> for offering to undertake the Office, and &s;aid, <HI>'Go, go,</HI> prithee, try what can'&s;t do;' and then &s;wore many execrable Oaths that he would turn her out of Doors unle&s;s &s;he con&s;ented to the Match.</P>

<PB N="302" REF="317">
He pre&s;ently ran to her, and with a Voice full at once of Tenderne&s;s and Terrour, cried, 'O my <HI>Sophia,</HI> what means this dreadful Sight!'&mdash;She looked &s;oftly at him for a Moment before &s;he &s;poke, and then &s;aid, 'Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> for Heaven's Sake, how came you here?&mdash;Leave me, I be&s;eech you, this Moment.' 'Do not,' &s;ays he, 'impo&s;e &s;o har&s;h a Command upon me&mdash;my Heart bleeds fa&s;ter than tho&s;e Lips.

A few Moments now pa&s;&s;ed in Silence between tho&s;e Lovers, while his Eyes were eagerly fixed on <HI>Sophia,</HI> and hers declining towards the Ground; and at la&s;t &s;he recovered Strength enough to de&s;ire him again to leave her; for that her cer|tain Ruin would be the Con&s;equence of their being found together; adding,&mdash;'O Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> you know not, you know not what pa&s;&s;ed this cruel After|noon.'

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Being of a much more tempe&s;tuous Kind than the for|mer.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed with what happened to our Lovers, it may be proper to recount what had pa&s;t in the Hall, during their tender Interview.</P>
<P>Soon after <HI>Jones</HI> had left Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> in the Man|ner above-mentioned, his Si&s;ter came to him; and was pre&s;ently informed of all that had pa&s;t between her Brother and <HI>Sophia,</HI> relating to <HI>Blifil.</HI></P>
<P>This Behaviour in her Neice, the good Lady con|&s;trued to an ab&s;olute Breach of the Condition, on which &s;he had engaged to keep her Love for Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> a Secret. She con&s;idered her&s;elf, therefore, at full Liberty to reveal all &s;he knew to the Squire, which &s;he did immediately in the mo&s;t explicite Terms, and without any Ceremony or Preface.</P>
<P>The Idea of a Marriage between <HI>Jones</HI> and his Daughter, had never once entered into the Squire's Head, either in the warme&s;t Minutes of his Affection towards that young Man, or from Su&s;picion, or on any other Occa&s;ion. He did indeed con&s;ider a Parity of Fortune and Circum&s;tances, to be phy&s;ically as nece&s;&s;ary an Ingredient in Marriage, as Difference of Sexes, or any other E&s;&s;ential; and had no more Ap|prehen&s;ion of his Daughter's falling in Love with a
<PB N="305" REF="320">
poor Man, than with any Animal of a different Species.</P>
<P>He became, therefore, like one Thunder&s;truck at his Si&s;ter's Relation. He was, at fir&s;t, incapable of mak|ing any An&s;wer, having been almo&s;t deprived of his Breath by the Violence of the Surprize. This, however, &s;oon returned, and as is u&s;ual in other Ca&s;es after an Intermi&s;&s;ion, with redoubled Force and Fury.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t U&s;e he made of the Power of Speech, af|ter his Recovery from the &s;udden Effects of his A&s;to|ni&s;hment, was to di&s;charge a round Volley of Oaths and Imprecations. After which he proceeded ha&s;tily to the Apartment, where he expected to find the Lovers, and murmured, or indeed, rather roared forth Intentions of Revenge every Step he went.</P>
<P>As when two Doves, or two Wood-pigeons, or as when <HI>Strephon</HI> and <HI>Phillis</HI> (for that comes neare&s;t to the Mark) are retired into &s;ome plea&s;ant &s;olitary Grove, to enjoy the delightful Conver&s;ation of Love; that ba&s;hful Boy who cannot &s;peak in public, and is never a good Companion to more than two at a Time. Here, while every Object is &s;erene, &s;hould a hoar&s;e Thunder bur&s;t &s;uddenly through the &s;hattered Clouds, and rumbling roll along the Sky, the frightened Maid &s;tarts from the mo&s;&s;y Bank or verdant Turf; the pale Livery of Death &s;ucceeds the red Regimentals in which Love had before dre&s;t her Cheeks; Fear &s;hakes her whole Frame, and her Lover &s;carce &s;upports her trembling, tottering Limbs.</P>
<P>Or as when two Gentlemen, Strangers to the won|derous Wit of the Place, are cracking a Bottle toge|ther at &s;ome Inn or Tavern at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> if the great <HI>Dowdy</HI> who acts the Part of a Madman, as well as &s;ome of his Setters-on do that of a Fool, &s;hould rat|tle his Chains, and dreadfully hum forth the grumb|ling Catch along the Gallery; the frighted Strangers &s;tand agha&s;t, &s;cared at the horrid Sound, they &s;eek
<PB N="306" REF="321">
&s;ome Place of Shelter from the approaching Danger, and if the well-barred Windows did admit their Exit, would venture their Necks to e&s;cape the threatning Fury now coming upon them.</P>
<P>So trembled poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;o turned &s;he pale at the Noi&s;e of her Father, who in a Voice mo&s;t dreadful to hear, came on &s;wearing, cur&s;ing and vowing the De|&s;truction of <HI>Jones.</HI> To &s;ay the Truth, I believe the Youth him&s;elf would, from &s;ome prudent Con&s;idera|tions, have preferred another Place of Abode at this Time, had his Terrour on <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Account given him Liberty to reflect a Moment on what any other|ways concerned him&s;elf, than as his Love made him partake whatever affected her.</P>
<P>And now the Squire having bur&s;t open the Door, beheld an Object which in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended all his Fu|ry again&s;t <HI>Jones;</HI> this was the gha&s;tly Appearance of <HI>Sophia,</HI> who had fainted away in her Lover's Arms. This tragical Sight Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> no &s;ooner beheld, than all his Rage for&s;ook him, he roared for Help with his utmo&s;t Violence; ran fir&s;t to his Daughter, then back to the Door, calling for Water, and then back again to <HI>Sophia,</HI> never con&s;idering in who&s;e Arms &s;he then was, nor, perhaps, once recollecting that there was &s;uch a Per&s;on in the World as <HI>Jones:</HI> For, indeed, I believe, the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of his Daughter were now the &s;ole con&s;ideration which em|ployed his Thoughts.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and a great Number of Servants &s;oon came to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Sophia,</HI> with Water, Cordi|als, and every Thing nece&s;&s;ary on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions. The&s;e were applied with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that <HI>Sophia</HI> in a very few Minutes began to recover, and all the Symptoms of Life to return. Upon which &s;he was pre&s;ently led off by her own Maid and Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> nor did that good Lady depart without leaving &s;ome whole&s;ome Admonitions with her Brother, on the
<PB N="307" REF="322">
dreadful Effects of his Pa&s;&s;ion, or, as &s;he plea&s;ed to call it, Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Squire, perhaps, did not under&s;tand this goo Advice, as it was delivered in ob&s;cure Hints, Shrugs, and Notes of Admiration; at lea&s;t, if he did under|&s;tand it, he profited very little by it: For no &s;ooner was he cured of his immediate Fears for his Daughter, than he relap&s;ed into his former Frenzy, which mu&s;t have produced an immediate Battle with <HI>Jones,</HI> had not Par&s;on <HI>Supple,</HI> who was a very &s;trong Man, been pre&s;ent, and by mere Force re&s;trained the Squire from Acts of Ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The Moment <HI>Sophia</HI> was departed, <HI>Jones</HI> advanced in a very &s;uppliant Manner to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> whom the Par&s;on held in his Arms, and begged him to be pacify'd; for that while he continued in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion it would be impo&s;&s;ible to give him any Satisfac|tion.</P>
<P>'I wull have &s;atisfaction o' thee,' an&s;wered the Squire, '&s;o doff thy Clothes. <HI>At unt</HI> half a Man, 'and I'll lick thee as well as wa&s;t ever licked in thy Life.' Hethen be&s;pattered the Youth with Abundance of that Language, which pa&s;&s;es between Country Gen|tlemen who embrace oppo&s;ite Sides of the Que&s;tion; with frequent Applications to him to &s;alute that Part which is generally introduced into all Controver&s;ies, that ari&s;e among the lower Orders of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|try, at Hor&s;e-races, Cock-matches, and other pub|lic Places. Allu&s;ions to this Part are likewi&s;e often made for the Sake of the Je&s;t. And here, I believe, the Wit is generally mi&s;under&s;tood. In Reality, it lies in de&s;iring another to ki&s;s your A&mdash;for having ju&s;t before threatened to kick his: For I have ob&s;erv|ed very accurately, that no one ever de&s;ires you to kick that which belongs to him&s;elf, nor offers to ki&s;s this Part in another.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e &s;eem &s;urprizing, that in the many thou&s;and kind Invitations of this Sort, which every
<PB N="308" REF="323">
one who hath conver&s;ed with Country Gentlemen, mu&s;t have heard, no one, I believe, hath ever &s;een a &s;ingle In&s;tance where the De&s;ire hath been com|plied with. A great In&s;tance of their Want of Po|litene&s;s: For in Town, nothing can be more com|mon than for the fine&s;t Gentlemen to perform this Ceremony every Day to their Superiors, without having that Favour once reque&s;ted of them.</P>
<P>To all &s;uch Wit, <HI>Jones</HI> very calmly an&s;wered, 'Sir, this U&s;age, may, perhaps, cancel every o|ther Obligation you have conferred on me; but there is one you can never cancel; nor will I be provoked by your Abu&s;e, to lift my Hand again&s;t the Father of <HI>Sophia.</HI>'</P>
<P>At the&s;e Words, the Squire grew &s;till more out|rageous than before; &s;o that the Par&s;on begged <HI>Jones</HI> to retire, &s;aying, 'You behold, Sir, how he waxeth Wroth at your abode here; therefore, let me pray you not to tarry any longer. His Anger is too much kindled for you to commune with him at pre|&s;ent. You had better, therefore, conclude your Vi&s;it, and refer what Matter you have to urge in your Behalf, to &s;ome other Opportunity.'</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> accepted this Advice with Thanks, and im|mediately departed. The Squire now regained the Liberty of his Hands, and &s;o much Temper as to expre&s;s &s;ome Satisfaction in the Re&s;traint which had been laid upon him; declaring that he &s;hould certainly have beat his Brains out; and adding, 'It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for &s;uch a Ra&s;cal.'</P>
<P>The Par&s;on now began to triumph in the Succe&s;s of his Peace-making Endeavours, and proceeded to read a Lecture again&s;t Anger, which might, perhaps, rather have tended to rai&s;e than to quiet that Pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ome ha&s;ty Minds. This Lecture he enriched with many valuable Quotations from the Antients, particularly from <HI>Seneca;</HI> who hath, indeed, &s;o well
<PB N="309" REF="324">
handled this Pa&s;&s;ion, that none but a very angry Man can read him without great Plea&s;ure and Profit. The Doctor concluded his Harangue with the famous Sto|ry of <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Clytus;</HI> but as I find that entered in my Common-Place under Title Drunkenne&s;s, I &s;hall not in&s;ert it here.</P>
<P>The Squire took no Notice of this Story, nor, perhaps, of any Thing he &s;aid: For he interrupted him before he had fini&s;hed by calling for a Tankard of Beer; ob&s;erving (which is, perhaps, as true as any Ob&s;ervation on this Fever of the Mind) <HI>that Anger makes a Man dry.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the Squire &s;wallowed a large Draught than he renewed the Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>Jones,</HI> and declared a Re&s;olution of going the next Morning early to acquaint Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI> His Friend would have di&s;&s;uaded him from this, from the mere Motive of Good-nature; but his Di&s;&s;ua&s;ion had no other Effect, than to produce a large Volley of Oaths and Cur&s;es, which greatly &s;hocked the pious Ears of <HI>Supple;</HI> but he did not dare to remon&s;trate again&s;t a Privilege, which the Squire claimed as a free-born <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> To &s;ay Truth, the Par&s;on &s;ubmitted to plea&s;e his Palate at the Squire's Table, at the Ex|pence of &s;uffering this Violence now and then to his Ears. He contented him&s;elf with thinking he did not promote this evil Practice, and that the Squire would not &s;wear an Oath the le&s;s if he never entered within his Gates. However, tho' he was not guilty of ill Manners by rebuking a Gentleman in his own Hou&s;e, he paid him off obliquely in the Pulpit; which had not, indeed, the good Effect of working a Re|formation in the Squire him&s;elf, yet it &s;o far operated on his Con&s;cience, that he put the Laws very &s;evere|ly in Execution again&s;t others, and the Magi&s;trate was the only Per&s;on in the Pari&s;h who could &s;wear with Impunity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>In which Mr.</HI> We&s;tern <HI>vi&s;its Mr.</HI> Allworthy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was now retired from Breakfa&s;t with his Nephew, well &s;atisfied with the Re|port of the young Gentleman's &s;ucce&s;sful Vi&s;it to <HI>Sophia</HI> (for he greatly de&s;ired the Match, more on Account of the young Lady's Character than of her Riches) when Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> broke abrubtly in upon them, and without any Ceremony began as follows.</P>
<P>'There, you have done a fine Piece of Work tru|ly. You have brought up your Ba&s;tard to a fine Purpo&s;e; not that I believe you have had any Hand in it neither, that is, as a Man may &s;ay, de&s;ignedly; but there is a fine Kettle of Fi&s;h made o't up at our Hou&s;e.' 'What can be the Matter, Mr. <HI>We&s;|tern?</HI> &s;aid <HI>Allworthy.</HI> O Matter <HI>enow</HI> of all Con|&s;cience; my Daughter hath fallen in Love with your Ba&s;tard, that's all, but I won't <HI>ge</HI> her a <HI>Ha|penny,</HI> not the Twentieth Part of a Bra&s;s Farthing. I always thought what would come o' breeding up a Ba&s;tard like a Gentleman, and letting <HI>un</HI> come a|bout to <HI>Volk'</HI>s Hou&s;es. Its well <HI>vor un</HI> I could not get <HI>at un,</HI> I'd <HI>a licked un,</HI> I'd a &s;poil'd his Ca|terwauling, I'd a taught the Son of a Whore to meddle with Meat for his Ma&s;ter. He &s;han't ever have a Mor&s;el of Meat of mine, or a Farthing to buy it: If &s;he will <HI>ha un,</HI> one Smock &s;hall be her Portion. I'll &s;ooner <HI>ge</HI> my <HI>E&s;teate</HI> to the <HI>zinking</HI> Fund, that it may be &s;ent to <HI>Hannover</HI> to corrupt our Nation with.' I am heartily &s;orry,' cries <HI>All|worthy.</HI> 'Pox o' your Sorrow,' &s;ays <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'it will do me Abundance of Good, when I have lo&s;t my only Child, my poor <HI>Sophy,</HI> that was the Joy of my Heart, and all the Hope and Comfort of my Age; but I am re&s;olved I will turn her out o' Doors, &s;he &s;hall beg and &s;tarve and rot in the Streets. Not
<PB N="311" REF="326">
one <HI>Hapenny,</HI> not a <HI>Hapenny</HI> &s;hall &s;he ever <HI>hae</HI> o' mine. The Son of a Bitch was always good at finding a Hare &s;itting; an be rotted to'n, I little thought what Pu&s;s he was looking after; but it &s;hall be the wor&s;t he ever <HI>vound</HI> in his Life. She &s;hall be no better than Carrion; the Skin o'er is all he &s;hall <HI>ha,</HI> and <HI>zu</HI> you may tell <HI>un.'</HI> 'I am in A|mazement,' cries <HI>Alllworthy</HI> 'at what you tell me, after what pa&s;&s;ed between my Nephew and the young Lady no longer ago than Ye&s;terday.' 'Yes, Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'it was after what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween your Nephew and &s;he that the whole Mat|ter came out. Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> there was no &s;ooner gone than the Son of a Whore came lurching about the Hou&s;e. Little did I think when I u&s;ed to love him for a Sport&s;man, that he was all the while a poach|ing after my Daughter.' 'Why, truly,' &s;ays <HI>All|worthy,</HI> 'I could wi&s;h you had not given him &s;o ma|ny Opportunities with her; and you will do me the Ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that I have always been aver&s;e to his &s;taying &s;o much at your Hou&s;e, tho' I own I had no Su&s;picion of this Kind.' 'Why, Zounds!' cries <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> 'who could have thought it? What the Devil had &s;he to do wi'n? He did not come there a courting to her, he came a hunt|ing with me.' 'But was it po&s;&s;ible,' &s;ays <HI>Allwor|thy,</HI> 'that you &s;hould never di&s;cern any Symptoms of Love between them, when you have &s;een them &s;o often together? 'Never in my Life, as I hope to be &s;aved,' cries <HI>We&s;tern.</HI> I never &s;o much as &s;ee him ki&s;s her in all my Life; and &s;o far from courting her, he u&s;ed rather to be more &s;ilent when &s;he was in Company than at any other Time: And as for the Girl, &s;he was always le&s;s civil to'n than to any young Man that came to the Hou&s;e. As to that Matter, I am not more ea&s;y to be deceived than another, I would not have you think I am Neigh|bour.' <HI>Allworthy</HI> could &s;carce refrain Laughter at
<PB N="312" REF="327">
this; but he re&s;olved to do a Violence to him&s;elf: For he perfectly well knew Mankind, and had too much good Breeding and good Nature to offend the Squire in his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. He then a&s;ked <HI>We&s;tern</HI> what he would have him do upon this Occa&s;ion. To which the other an&s;wered, 'That he would have him keep the Ra&s;cal away from his Hou&s;e, and that he would go and lock up the Wench: For he was re&s;olved to make her marry Mr. <HI>Blifil</HI> in Spite of her Teeth.' He then &s;hook <HI>Blifil</HI> by the Hand, and &s;wore he would have no other Son-in-law. Pre&s;ent|ly after which he took his Leave, &s;aying, his Hou&s;e was in &s;uch Di&s;order, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to make Ha&s;te home, to take care his Daughter did not give him the Slip; and as for <HI>Jones,</HI> he &s;wore if he caught him at his Hou&s;e, he would qualify him to run for the Gelding's Plate.</P>
<P>When <HI>Allworthy</HI> and <HI>Blifil</HI> were again left toge|ther, a long Silence en&s;ued between them; all which Interval the young Gentleman filled up with Sighs, which proceeded partly from Di&s;appointment, but more from Hatred: For the Succe&s;s of <HI>Jones</HI> was much more grievous to him, than the Lo&s;s of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>At length his Uncle a&s;ked him what he was deter|mined to do, and he an&s;wered in the following Words. 'Alas, Sir, can it be a Que&s;tion what Step a Lover will take, when Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ion point different Ways? I am afraid it is too certain he will, in that Dilemma, always follow the latter. Rea&s;on dic|tates to me, to quit all Thoughts of a Woman who places her Affections on another; my Pa&s;&s;ion bids me hope &s;he may, in Time, change her Inclinations in my Favour. Here, however, I conceive an Ob|jection may be rai&s;ed, which if it could not fully be an&s;wered, would totally deter me from any fur|ther Pur&s;uit. I mean the Inju&s;tice of endeavouring to &s;upplant another, in a Heart of which he &s;eems already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but the determined Re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="313" REF="328">
of Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> &s;hews, that in this Ca&s;e, I &s;hall by &s;o doing, promote the Happine&s;s of every Party; not only that of the Parent, who will thus be pre|&s;erved from the highe&s;t Degree of Mi&s;ery, but of both the others, who mu&s;t be undone by this Match. The Lady, I am &s;ure, will be undone in every Sen&s;e: For be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of mo&s;t Part of her own Fortune, &s;he will be married not only to a Beg|gar, but the little Fortune which her Father cannot with-hold from her, will be &s;quandered on that Wench, with whom I know he yet conver&s;es&mdash;Nay, that is a Trifle: For I know him to be one of the wor&s;t Men in the World: For had my dear Un|cle known what I have hitherto endeavoured to con|ceal, he mu&s;t have long &s;ince abandoned &s;o profli|gate a Wretch.' 'How,' &s;aid <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'hath he done any Thing wor&s;e than I already know? Tell me, I be&s;eech you.' 'No,' replied <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'it is now pa&s;t, and perhaps he may have repented of it.' 'I command you on your Duty,' &s;aid <HI>Allworthy,</HI> to tell me what you mean.' 'You know, Sir,' &s;ays <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'I never di&s;obeyed you: but I am &s;orry I mentioned it, &s;ince it may now look like Revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no &s;uch Motive ever en|tered my Heart; and if you oblige me to di&s;cover it, I mu&s;t be his Petitioner to you for your Forgive|ne&s;s.' 'I will have no Conditions,' an&s;wered <HI>All|worthy,</HI> 'I think I have &s;hewn Tenderne&s;s enough towards him, and more, perhaps, than you ought to thank me for.' 'More, indeed, I fear than he de&s;erved,' cries <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'for in the very Day of your utmo&s;t Danger, when my&s;elf and all the Family were in Tears, he filled the Hou&s;e with Riot and De|bauchery. He drank and &s;ung and roared, and when I gave him a gentle Hint of the Indecency of his Actions, he fell into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;wore many Oaths, called me Ra&s;cal, and &s;truck me.' 'How!' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'did he dare to &s;trike you?' 'I am
<PB N="314" REF="329">
&s;ure,' cries <HI>Blifil,</HI> 'I have forgiven him that long ago. I wi&s;h I could &s;o ea&s;ily forget his Ingratitude to the be&s;t of Benefactors; and yet, even that, I hope you will forgive him, &s;ince he mu&s;t have certainly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Devil: For that very Even|ing, as Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> and my&s;elf were taking the Air in the Fields, and exulting in the good Symp|toms which then fir&s;t began to di&s;cover them&s;elves, we unluckily &s;aw him engaged with a Wench in a Manner not fit to be mentioned. Mr. <HI>Thwackum,</HI> with more Boldne&s;s than Prudence, advanced to re|buke him, (when I am &s;orry to &s;ay it,) he fell up|on the worthy Man, and beat him &s;o outragiou&s;ly, that I wi&s;h he may have yet recovered the Brui&s;es. Nor was I without my Share of the Effects of his Malice, while I endeavoured to protect my Tutor: But that I have long forgiven, nay I prevailed with Mr. <HI>Thwackum</HI> to forgive him too, and not to in|form you of a Secret which I feared might be fatal to him. And now, Sir, &s;ince I have unadvi&s;edly dropped a Hint of this Matter, and your Commands have obliged me to di&s;cover the whole, let me inter|cede with you for him.' 'O Child,' &s;aid <HI>Allworthy,</HI> I know not whether I &s;hould blame or applaud your Goodne&s;s, in concealing &s;uch Villany a Moment; but where is Mr. <HI>Thwackum?</HI> Not that I want any Confirmation of what you &s;ay; but I will examine all the Evidence of this Matter, to ju&s;tify to the World the Example I am re&s;olved to make of &s;uch a Mon&s;ter.'</P>
<P><HI>Thwackum</HI> was now &s;ent for, and pre&s;ently ap|peared. He corroborated every Circum&s;tance which the other depo&s;ed. Nay, he produced the Record up|on his Brea&s;t, where the Hand-writing of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> remained very legible in black and blue. He con|cluded with declaring to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> that he &s;hould have long &s;ince informed him of this Matter, had not Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> by the mo&s;t earne&s;t Interpo&s;itions,
<PB N="315" REF="330">
prevented him. 'He is, &s;ays he, an excellent Youth; though &s;uch Forgivene&s;s of Enemies is carrying the Matter too far.'</P>
<P>In reality, <HI>Blifil</HI> had taken &s;ome Pains to prevail with the Par&s;on, and to prevent the Di&s;covery at that Time; for which he had many Rea&s;ons. He knew that the Minds of Men are apt to be &s;oftened and re|laxed from their u&s;ual Severity by Sickne&s;s. Be|&s;ides, he imagined that if the Story was told when the Fact was &s;o recent, and the Phy&s;ician about the Hou&s;e, who might have unravelled the real Truth, he &s;hould never be able to give it the malicious Turn which he intended. Again, he re&s;olved to hoard up this Bu&s;ine&s;s, till the Indi&s;cretion of <HI>Jones</HI> &s;hould af|ford &s;ome additional Complaints; for he thought the joint Weight of many Facts falling upon him toge|ther, would be the mo&s;t likely to cru&s;h him; and he watched therefore &s;ome &s;uch Opportunity as that, with which Fortune had now kindly pre&s;ented him. La&s;tly, by prevailing with <HI>Thwackum</HI> to conceal the Matter for a Time, he knew he &s;hould confirm an Opinion of his Friend&s;hip to <HI>Jones,</HI> which he had greatly laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h in Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A &s;hort Chapter; but which contains &s;ufficient Matter to affect the good-natured Reader.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Cu&s;tom never to puni&s;h any one, not even to turn away a Servant, in a Pa&s;&s;ion. He re&s;olved, therefore, to delay his pa&s;|&s;ing Sentence on <HI>Jones</HI> till the Afternoon.</P>
<P>The poor young Man attended at Dinner, as u&s;ual; but his Heart was too much loaded to &s;uffer him to eat. His Grief was a good deal aggravated by the un|kind Looks of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> whence he concluded that <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had di&s;covered the whole Affair between him and <HI>Sophia:</HI> But as to Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Story, he had
<PB N="316" REF="331">
not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion; for of much the greater Part he was entirely innocent, and for the Re&s;idue, as he had forgiven and forgotten it him&s;elf, &s;o he &s;u&s;|pected no Remembrance on the other Side. When Dinner was over, and the Servants departed, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> began to harangue. He &s;et forth, in a long Speech, the many Iniquities of which <HI>Jones</HI> had been guilty, particularly tho&s;e which this Day had brought to light, and concluded by telling him, 'that unle&s;s he could clear him&s;elf of the Charge, he was re&s;olv|ed to bani&s;h him from his Sight for ever.'</P>
<P>Many Di&s;advantages attended poor <HI>Jones</HI> in making his Defence; nay, indeed he hardly knew his Accu|&s;ation: For as Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> in recounting the Drunkenne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> while he lay ill, out of mode&s;ty &s;unk every thing that related particularly to him&s;elf, which indeed principally con&s;tituted the Crime, <HI>Jones</HI> could not deny the Charge. His Heart was, be&s;ides, almo&s;t broken already, and his Spirits were &s;o &s;unk, that he could &s;ay nothing for him&s;elf; but acknow|ledged the whole, and, like a Criminal in De&s;pair, threw him&s;elf upon Mercy; concluding, 'That tho' he mu&s;t own him&s;elf guilty of many Follies and Inadvertencies, he hoped he had done nothing to de&s;erve what would be to him the greate&s;t Puni&s;h|ment in the World.'</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> an&s;wered, 'that he had forgiven him too often already, in Compa&s;&s;ion to his Youth, and in Hopes of his Amendment: That he now found he was an abandoned Reprobate, and &s;uch as it would be criminal in any one to &s;upport and en|courage. Nay,' &s;aid Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> to him, 'your audacious Attempt to &s;teal away the young Lady, calls upon me to ju&s;tify my own Character in pu|ni&s;hing you. The World, who have already cen|&s;ured the Regard I have for you, may think, with &s;ome Colour at lea&s;t of Ju&s;tice, that I connive at

&s;o ba&s;e and barbarous an Action. An Action of which you mu&s;t have known my Abhorrence, and which, had you any Concern for my Ea&s;e and Ho|nour, as well as for my Friend&s;hip, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon it, young Man! indeed there is &s;carce any Puni&s;hment equal to your Crimes, and I can &s;carce think my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in what I am now going to be&s;tow on you. However, as I have educated you like a Child of my own, I will not turn you naked into the World. When you open this Paper, there|fore, you will find &s;omething which may enable you with Indu&s;try, to get an hone&s;t Livelihood; but if you employ it to wor&s;e Purpo&s;es, I &s;hall not think my&s;elf obliged to &s;upply you farther, be|ing re&s;olved, from this Day forward, to conver&s;e no more with you on any Account. I cannot avoid &s;aying, There is no Part of your Conduct which I re&s;ent more than your ill Treatment of that good young Man (meaning <HI>Blifil)</HI> who had behaved with &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and Honour towards you.'</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t Words were a Do&s;e almo&s;t too bitter to be &s;wallowed. A Flood of Tears now gu&s;hed from the Eyes of <HI>Jones,</HI> and every Faculty of Speech and Motion &s;eemed to have de&s;erted him. It was &s;ome Time before he was able to obey <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s peremp|tory Commands of departing; which he at length did, having fir&s;t ki&s;&s;ed his Hands with a Pa&s;&s;ion dif|ficult to be affected, and as difficult be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Reader mu&s;t be very weak, if when he con|&s;iders the Light in which <HI>Jones</HI> then appeared to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> he &s;hould blame the Rigour of his Sen|tence. And yet all the Neighbourhood, either from this Weakne&s;s, or from a wor&s;e Motive, condemned this Ju&s;tice and Severity as the highe&s;t Cruelty. Nay, the very Per&s;ons who had before cen&s;ured the good Man for the Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s &s;hewn

to a Ba&s;tard (his own, according to the general Opi|nion) now cried out as loudly again&s;t turning his own Child out of Doors. The Women e&s;pecially were unanimous in taking the Part of <HI>Jones,</HI> and rai&s;|ed more Stories on the Occa&s;ion, than I have room, in this Chapter, to &s;et down.</P>
<P>One Thing mu&s;t not be omitted, that in their Cen|&s;ures on this Occa&s;ion, none ever mentioned the Sum contained in the Paper which <HI>Allworthy</HI> gave <HI>Jones,</HI> which was no le&s;s than Five hundred Pounds; but all agreed that he was &s;ent away Pennyle&s;s, and &s;ome &s;aid, naked from the Hou&s;e of his inhuman Father.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> was commanded to leave the Hou&s;e im|mediately, and told, that his Clothes and every thing el&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent to him whither&s;oever he &s;hould order them.</P>
<P>He accordingly &s;et out, and walked above a Mile, not regarding, and indeed &s;carce knowing whither he went. At length a little Brook ob&s;tructed his Pa&s;|&s;age, he threw him&s;elf down by the Side of it; nor could he help muttering with &s;ome little Indignation, 'Sure my Father will not deny me this Place to re&s;t in?'</P>
<P>Here he pre&s;ently fell into the mo&s;t violent Ago|nies, tearing his Hair from his Head, and u&s;ing mo&s;t other Actions which generally accompany Fits of Madne&s;s, Rage, and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>When he had in this Manner vented the fir&s;t Emo|tions of Pa&s;&s;ion, he began to come a little to him|&s;elf. His Grief now took another Turn, and di&s;|charged it&s;elf in a gentler Way, till he became at la&s;t cool enough to rea&s;on with his Pa&s;&s;ion, and to con&s;ider what Steps were proper to be taken in his deplorable Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="334">
And now the great Doubt was how to act with regard to <HI>Sophia.</HI> The Thoughts of leaving her al|mo&s;t rent his Heart a&s;under; but the Con&s;ideration of reducing her to Ruin and Beggary &s;till racked him, if po&s;&s;ible, more; and if the violent De&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing her Per&s;on could have &s;uffered him to li&s;ten one Moment to the Alternative, &s;till he was by no means certain of her Re&s;olution to indulge his Wi&s;hes at &s;o high an Expence. The Re&s;entment of Mr. <HI>Allwor|thy,</HI> and the Injury he mu&s;t do to his Quiet, argued &s;trongly again&s;t this latter; and la&s;tly, the apparent Impo&s;&s;ibility of his Succe&s;s, even if he would &s;a|crifice all the&s;e Con&s;iderations to it, came to his A&s;&s;i&s;|tance; and thus Honour at la&s;t, backed with De&s;pair, with Gratitude to his Benefactor, and with real Love to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, got the better of burning De&s;ire, and he re&s;olved rather to quit <HI>Sophia,</HI> than to pur&s;ue her to Ruin.</P>
<P>It is difficult for any who have not felt it, to con|ceive the glowing Warmth which filled his Brea&s;t, on the fir&s;t Contemplation of this Victory over his Pa&s;&s;ion. Pride flattered him &s;o agreeably, that his Mind perhaps enjoyed perfect Happine&s;s; but this was only momentary, <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;oon returned to his Imagination, and allayed the Joy of his Triumph with no le&s;s bitter Pangs than a good-natured Gene|ral mu&s;t feel when he &s;urveys the bleeding Heaps, at the Price of who&s;e Blood he hath purcha&s;ed his Lau|rels; for thou&s;ands of tender Ideas lay murdered be|fore our Conqueror.</P>
<P>Being re&s;olved, however, to pur&s;ue the Paths of this Giant Honour, as the gigantic Poet <HI>Lee</HI> calls it, he determined to write a farewel to <HI>Sophia;</HI> and accordingly proceeded to a Hou&s;e not far off, where, being furni&s;hed with Materials, he wrote as follows:
<LETTER LANG="eng">

MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'WHEN you reflect on the Situation in which I write, I am &s;ure your Good-nature will pardon any Incon&s;i&s;tency or Ab&s;urdity which my Letter contains; for every thing here flows from a Heart &s;o full, that no Language can expre&s;s its Dictates.'</P>
<P>'I have re&s;olved, Madam, to obey your Commands, in flying for ever from your dear, your lovely Sight. Cruel indeed tho&s;e Commands are; but it is a Cruelty which proceeds from Fortune, not from my <HI>Sophia.</HI> Fortune hath made it nece&s;&s;ary, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to your Pre&s;ervation, to forget there ever was &s;uch a Wretch as I am.'</P>
<P>'Believe me, I would not hint all my Sufferings to you, if I imagined they could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape your Ears.

<P>'O my <HI>Sophia!</HI> it is hard to leave you; it is hard|er &s;till to de&s;ire you to forget me; yet the &s;incere&s;t Love obliges me to both.

<P>He was now &s;earching his Pockets for his Wax, but found none, nor indeed any thing el&s;e, therein; for in Truth he had, in his frantic Di&s;po&s;ition, to&s;&s;ed every thing from him, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, his
<PB N="321" REF="336">
Pocket-book, which he had received from Mr. <HI>All|worthy,</HI> which he had never opened, and which now fir&s;t occurred to his Memory.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e &s;upplied him with a Wafer for his pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e, with which having &s;ealed his Letter, he returned ha&s;tily towards the Brook Side, in or|der to &s;earch for the Things which he had there lo&s;t. In his Way he met his old Friend <HI>Black George,</HI> who heartily condoled with him on his misfortune; for this had already reached his Ears, and indeed tho&s;e of all the Neighbours.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> acquainted the Game-keeper with his Lo&s;s, and he as readily went back with him to the Brook, where they &s;earched every Tuft of Gra&s;s in the Mea|dow, as well where <HI>Jones</HI> had not been, as where he had been; but all to no Purpo&s;e, for they found nothing: For indeed, though the Things were then in the Meadow, they omitted to &s;earch the only Place where they were depo&s;ited; to wit, in the Pockets of the &s;aid <HI>George;</HI> for he had ju&s;t before found them, and being luckily apprized of their Value, had very carefully put them up for his own U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Game-keeper having exerted as much Dili|gence in Que&s;t of lo&s;t Goods, as if he had hoped to find them, de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to recollect if he had been in no other Place; 'For &s;ure,' '&s;aid he, 'if you had lo&s;t them here &s;o lately, the Things mu&s;t have been here &s;till; for this is a very unlikely Place for any one to pa&s;s by;' and indeed it was by great Accident that he him&s;elf had pa&s;&s;ed through the Field, in order to lay the Wires for Hares, with which he was to &s;upply a Poulterer at <HI>Bath</HI> the next Morn|ing.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now gave over all Hopes of recovering his Lo&s;s, and almo&s;t all Thoughts concerning it, and turning to <HI>Black George,</HI> a&s;ked him earne&s;tly, If he would do him the greate&s;t Favour in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="337">
<HI>'George</HI> an&s;wered, with &s;ome He&s;itation, Sir, you know you may command me whatever is in my Power, and I heartily wi&s;h it was in my Power to do you any Service.' In fact, the Que&s;tion &s;tag|gared him; for he had, by &s;elling Game, ama&s;&s;ed a pretty good Sum of Money in Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Ser|vice, and was afraid that <HI>Jones</HI> wanted to borrow &s;ome &s;mall Matter of him; but he was pre&s;ently relieved from his Anxiety, by being de&s;ired to convey a Let|ter to <HI>Sophia,</HI> which with great Plea&s;ure he promi&s;ed to do. And indeed, I believe there are few Favours which he would not have gladly conferred on Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> for he bore as much Gratitude towards him as he could, and was as hone&s;t as Men who love Money better than any other Thing in the Univer&s;e generally are.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was agreed by both to be the proper Means by which this Letter &s;hould pa&s;s to <HI>Sophia.</HI> They then &s;eparated; the Game-keeper returned home to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s, and <HI>Jones</HI> walked to an Ale-hou&s;e at half a Mile's Di&s;tance, to wait for his Me&s;&s;enger's Return.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> no &s;ooner came home to his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, than he met with Mrs. <HI>Honour;</HI> to whom, having fir&s;t &s;ounded her with a few previous Que&s;tions, he delivered the Letter for her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and received at the &s;ame Time another from her for Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> which <HI>Honour</HI> told him &s;he had carried all that Day in her Bo&s;om, and began to de&s;pair of finding any Means of delivering it.</P>
<P>The Game-keeper returned ha&s;tily and joyfully to <HI>Jones,</HI> who having received <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Letter from him, in&s;tantly withdrew, and eagerly breaking it open, read as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> read this Letter a hundred Times over, and ki&s;&s;ed it a hundred Times as often. His Pa&s;&s;ion now brought all tender De&s;ires back into his Mind. He repented that he had writ to <HI>Sophia</HI> in the Manner we have &s;een above; but he repented more that he had made u&s;e of the Interval of his Me&s;&s;enger's Ab&s;ence to write and di&s;patch a Letter to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> in which he had faithfully promi&s;ed and bound him&s;elf to quit all Thoughts of his Love. However, when his cool Reflections returned, he plainly perceived that his Ca&s;e was neither mended nor altered by <HI>So|phia'</HI>s Billet, unle&s;s to give him &s;ome little Glimp&s;e of Hope from her Con&s;tancy, of &s;ome favourable Accident hereafter. He therefore re&s;umed his Re|&s;olution, and taking leave of <HI>Black George,</HI> &s;et for|ward to a Town about five Miles di&s;tant, whither he had de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> unle&s;s he plea&s;ed to re|voke his Sentence, to &s;end his Things after him.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Behaviour of</HI> Sophia <HI>on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion; which none of her Sex will blame, who are capable of behaving in the &s;ame Manner. And the Di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of a knotty Point in the Court of Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>SOPHIA</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t twenty-four Hours in no very de&s;irable Manner. During a large Part of them &s;he had been entertained by her Aunt, with Lectures of Prudence, recommending to her the Ex|ample of the polite World, where Women con&s;ider
<PB N="324" REF="339">
Matrimony, as Men do Offices of public Tru&s;t, only as the means of making their Fortunes, and of ad|vancing them&s;elves in the World. In commenting on which Text Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had di&s;played her Elo|quence &s;everal Hours.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;agacious Lectures, though little &s;uited ei|ther to the Ta&s;te or Inclination of <HI>Sophia,</HI> were, however, le&s;s irk&s;ome to her than her own Thoughts, that formed the Entertainment of the Night, during which &s;he never once clo&s;ed her Eyes.</P>
<P>But though &s;he could neither &s;leep nor re&s;t in her Bed, yet, having no Avocation from it, &s;he was found there by her Father at his return from <HI>Allwor|thy'</HI>s, which was not till pa&s;t Ten o'Clock in the Morning. He went directly up to her Apartment, opened the Door, and &s;eeing &s;he was not up&mdash;cried 'Oh! you are &s;afe then, and I am re&s;olved to keep you &s;o' He then locked the Door and de|livered the Key to <HI>Honour,</HI> having fir&s;t given her the &s;tricte&s;t Charge, with great Promi&s;es of Rewards for her Fidelity, and mo&s;t dreadful Menaces of Puni&s;h|ment, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould betray her Tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Honour'</HI>s Orders were not to &s;uffer her Mi&s;tre&s;s to come out of her Room without the Authority of the Squire him&s;elf, and to admit none to her but him and her Aunt; but &s;he was her&s;elf to attend her with whatever <HI>Sophia</HI> plea&s;ed, except only Pen, Ink, and Paper, of which &s;he was forbidden the U&s;e.</P>
<P>The Squire ordered his Daughter to dre&s;s her&s;elf and attend him at Dinner; which &s;he obeyed; and having &s;at the u&s;ual Time, was conducted to her Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Evening, the Goaler <HI>Honour</HI> brought her the Letter which &s;he received from the Game-keeper. <HI>Sophia</HI> read it very attentively twice or thrice over, and then threw her&s;elf upon the Bed, and bur&s;t into a Flood of Tears. Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> expre&s;&s;ed great A&s;toni&s;hment at this Behaviour in her Mi&s;tre&s;s; nor
<PB N="325" REF="340">
could &s;he forbear very eagerly begging to know the Cau&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Sophia</HI> made her no An&s;wer for &s;ome Time, and then &s;tarting &s;uddenly up, caught her Maid by the Hand, and cried, 'O <HI>Honour!</HI> I am undone.' 'I wi&s;h the Letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your La'&s;hip. I'm &s;ure I thought it would have comforted your La'&s;hip, or I would have &s;een it at the Devil before I would have touch'd it.' <HI>'Honour,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'you are a good Girl, and it is vain to attempt conceal|ing longer my Weakne&s;s from you; I have thrown away my Heart on a Man who hath for&s;aken me.' And is Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> an&s;wered the Maid, '&s;uch a Per|fidy Man?' 'He hath taken his Leave of me' &s;ays <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'for ever in that Letter. Nay, he hath de|&s;ired me to forget him. Could he have de&s;ired that, if he had loved me? Could he have borne &s;uch a Thought? could he have written &s;uch a Word?' No certainly, Ma'am,' cries <HI>Honour,</HI> 'and to be &s;ure, if the be&s;t Man in <HI>England</HI> was to de&s;ire me to forget him, I'd take him at his Word. Marry come up! I am &s;ure your La'&s;hip hath done him too much Honour ever to think on him. A young Lady who may take her Choice of all the young Men in the County. And to be &s;ure, if I may be &s;o pre|&s;umptious as to offer my poor Opinion, there is young Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> who be&s;ides that he is come of ho|ne&s;t Parents, and will be one of the greate&s;t Squires all hereabouts, he is to be &s;ure, in my poor Opi|nion, a more hand&s;omer, and a more politer Man by half; and be&s;ides, he is a young Gentleman of a &s;ober Character, and may defy any of the Neigh|bours to &s;ay black is his Eye: He follows no dirty Trollops, nor can any Ba&s;tards be laid at his Door. Forget him indeed! I thank Heaven I my&s;elf am not &s;o much at my la&s;t Prayers, as to &s;uffer any Man to bid me forget him twice. If the be&s;t He that wears a Head was for to go for to offer for to

&s;ay &s;uch an affronting Word to me, I would never give him my Company afterwards, if there was another young Man in the Kingdom. And as I was a &s;aying, to be &s;ure, there is young Mr. <HI>Blifil,&mdash;</HI>Name not his dete&s;ted Name,' cries <HI>Sophia.</HI> 'Nay, Ma'am, &s;ays <HI>Honour,</HI> if your La'&s;hip doth not like him, there be more jolly hand&s;ome young Men that would court your La'&s;hip, if they had but the lea&s;t Encouragement. I don't believe there is arrow young Gentleman in this County, or the next to it, that if your La'&s;hip was but to look as if you had a Mind to him, would not come about to make his Offers directly.' 'What a Wretch do&s;t thou ima|gine me,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> 'by affronting my Ears with &s;uch Stuff! I dete&s;t all Mankind.' 'Nay, to be &s;ure, Ma'am,' an&s;wered <HI>Honour,</HI> 'your La'&s;hip hath had enough to give you a Surfeit of them. To be u&s;ed ill by &s;uch a poor beggarly ba&s;tardly Fellow.' Hold your bla&s;phemous Tongue,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> how dare you mention his Name with Di&s;re&s;pect before me? He u&s;e me ill? No, his poor bleed|ing Heart &s;uffered more when he writ the cruel Words, than mine from reading them. O! he is all heroic Virtue, and Angelic Goodne&s;s. I am a&s;hamed of the Weakne&s;s of my own Pa&s;&s;ion, for blaming what I ought to admire.&mdash;O <HI>Honour!</HI> it is my good only which he con&s;ults. To my In|tere&s;t he &s;acrifices both him&s;elf and me.&mdash;The Apprehen&s;ion of ruining me hath driven him to De|&s;pair.' 'I am very glad, &s;ays <HI>Honour,</HI> 'to hear your La'&s;hip takes that into your Con&s;ideration: for to be &s;ure, it mu&s;t be nothing le&s;s than Ruin, to give your Mind to one that is turned out of Doors, and is not worth a Farthing in the World. 'Turn|ed out of Doors! cries <HI>Sophia</HI> ha&s;tily, 'how! what do&s;t thou mean? 'Why, to be &s;ure, Ma'am, my Ma&s;ter no &s;ooner told Squire <HI>Allworthy</HI> about Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having offered to make Love to your

'Lady&s;hip, than the Squire &s;tripped him &s;tark naked, and turned him out of Doors.

Here, <HI>Honour,</HI> take all the Money I have; take the Rings from my Fingers.&mdash;Here my Watch, carry him all.&mdash;Go, find him immediately.

Therefore let me beg your Lady&s;hip not to part with your Watch and Jewels. Be&s;ides the Mo|ney, I think, is enough of all Con&s;cience; and as for that, my Ma&s;ter can never know any thing of the Matter.' 'Here then,' cries <HI>Sophia,</HI> take every Farthing I am worth, find him out immediately and' give it him. Go, go, lo&s;e not a Moment.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> departed according to Orders, and finding <HI>Black George</HI> below Stairs, delivered him the Pur&s;e which contained Sixteen Guineas, being in|deed the whole Stock of <HI>Sophia:</HI> For tho' her Father was very liberal to her, &s;he was much too generous her&s;elf to be rich.</P>
<P><HI>Black George</HI> having received the Pur&s;e, &s;et for|ward towards the Alehou&s;e; but in the Way a Thought occurred to him, whether he &s;hould not de|tain this Money likewi&s;e. His Con&s;cience, how|ever, immediately &s;tarted at this Sugge&s;tion, and be|gan to upbraid him with Ingratitude to his Benefac|tor. To this his Avarice an&s;wered, 'That his Con|&s;cience &s;hould have con&s;idered that Matter before, when he deprived poor <HI>Jones</HI> of his <HI>500l.</HI> That having quietly acquie&s;ced in what was of &s;o much greater Importance, it was ab&s;urd, if not down|right Hypocri&s;y, to affect any Qualms at this Trifle.' In return to which, Con&s;cience, like a good Lawyer, attempted to di&s;tingui&s;h between an ab&s;olute Breach of Tru&s;t, as here where the Goods were de|livered,
<PB N="328" REF="343">
and a bare Concealment of what was found, as in the former Ca&s;e. Avarice pre&s;ently treated this with Ridicule, called it a Di&s;tinction without a Differ|ence, and ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted, that when once all Pre|ten&s;ions of Honour and Virtue were given up in any one In&s;tance, that there was no Precedent for re&s;orting to them upon a &s;econd Occa&s;ion. In &s;hort, poor Con|&s;cience had certainly been defeated in the Argument, had not Fear &s;tept in to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and very &s;tre|nuou&s;ly urged, that the real Di&s;tinction between the two Actions, did not lie in the different Degrees of Honour, but of Safety: For that the &s;ecreting the <HI>500l.</HI> was a Matter of very little Hazard; whereas the detaining the Sixteen Guineas was liable to the utmo&s;t Danger of Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>By this friendly Aid of Fear, Con&s;cience obtained a compleat Victory in the Mind of <HI>Black George,</HI> and after making him a few Compliments on his Hone&s;ty, forced him to deliver the Money to <HI>Jones.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>A &s;hort Chapter, containing a &s;hort Dialogue between Squire</HI> We&s;tern <HI>and his Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MRS. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had been engaged abroad all that Day. The Squire met her at her Return home; and when &s;he enquired after <HI>Sophia,</HI> he ac|quainted her that he had &s;ecured her &s;afe enough. 'She is locked up in Chamber,' cries he, 'and <HI>Honour</HI> keeps the Key.' As his Looks were full of prodi|gious Wi&s;dom and Sagacity when he gave his Si&s;ter this Information, it is probable he expected much Applau&s;e from her for what he had done; but how was he di&s;appointed, when with a mo&s;t di&s;dainful A&s;|pect, &s;he cried, 'Sure Brother, you are the weake&s;t of all Men. Why will you not confide in me for the Management of my Niece? Why will you in|terpo&s;e?
<PB N="329" REF="344">
You have now undone all that I have been &s;pending my Breath in order to bring about. While I have been endeavouring to fill her Mind with Ma|xims of Prudence, you have been provoking her to reject them. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women, Brother, I thank Heaven, are no Slaves. We are not to be locked up like the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Wives. We have as good a Right to Liberty as your&s;elves. We are to be convinced by Rea&s;on and Per&s;ua&s;ion only, and not governed by Force. I have &s;een the World, Brother, and know what Arguments to make U&s;e of; and if your Folly had not prevented me, &s;hould have prevailed with her to form her Conduct by tho&s;e Rules of Prudence and Di&s;cretion which I for|merly taught her.' 'To be &s;ure,' &s;aid the Squire,. I am always in the Wrong.' 'Brother,' an&s;wered the Lady, 'you are not in the Wrong, unle&s;s when you meddle with Matters beyond your Know|ledge. You mu&s;t agree, that I have &s;een mo&s;t of the World; and happy had it been for my Niece, if &s;he had not been taken from under my Care. It is by living at home with you that &s;he hath learnt ro|mantick Notions of Love and Non&s;en&s;e.' 'You don't imagine, I hope,' cries the Squire, 'that I have taught her any &s;uch Things.' Your Ignorance, Brother,' returned &s;he, 'as the great <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays, almo&s;t &s;ubdues my Patience.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader may perhaps &s;ubdue his own Patience, if he &s;earches for this in <HI>Milton.</HI></NOTE> 'D&mdash;n <HI>Milton,'</HI> an|&s;wered the Squire, 'if he had the Impudence to &s;ay &s;o to my Face, I'd lend him a Dou&s;e, thof he was never &s;o great a Man. Patience! an you come to that, Si&s;ter, I have more Occa&s;ion of Patience, to be u&s;ed like an overgrown School-boy as I am by' you. Do you think no one hath any Under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="330" REF="345">
unle&s;s he hath been about at Court? Pox! the World is come to a fine Pa&s;s indeed, if we are all Fools, except a Parcel of Roundheads and <HI>Han|nover</HI> Rats. Pox! I hope the Times are a coming that we &s;hall make Fools of them, and every Man &s;hall enjoy his own. That's all, Si&s;ter, and every man &s;hall enjoy his own. I hope to <HI>zee</HI> it, Si&s;ter, before the <HI>Hannover</HI> Rats have eat up all our Corn, and left us nothing but Turneps to feed upon.' 'I prote&s;t, Brother,' cries &s;he, 'you are now got beyond my Under&s;tanding. Your Jargon of Tur|neps and <HI>Hannover</HI> Rats, is to me perfectly unin|telligible.' 'I believe,' cries he, 'you don't care to hear o'em; but the country Intere&s;t may &s;ucceed one Day or other for all that. 'I wi&s;h,' an&s;wered the Lady, 'you would think a little of your Daugh|ter's Intere&s;t: For believe me, &s;he is in greater Danger than the Nation.' 'Ju&s;t now,' &s;aid he, you chid me for thinking on her, and would ha' her left to you.' 'And if you will promi&s;e to interpo&s;e on more,' an&s;wered &s;he, 'I will, out of my Regard to my Niece, undertake the Charge.' 'Well, do then,' &s;aid the Squire, 'for you know I always a|greed, that Women are the propere&s;t to manage Women.'</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> then departed, muttering &s;omething with an Air of Di&s;dain, concerning Women and the Management of the Nation. She immediately re|paired to <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Apartment, who was now, after a Day's Confinement relea&s;ed again from her Cap|tivity.</P>
