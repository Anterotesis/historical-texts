<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I reflect upon that ready Conde|&s;cen&s;ion, that preventing Genero&s;ity, with which YOUR ROYAL HIGH|NESS received the following Poem un|der your Protection; I can alone a&s;cribe it to the Recommendation, and Influence of the Subject. In you the Cau&s;e and Concerns of Liberty have &s;o
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
zealous a Patron, as entitles whatever may have the lea&s;t Tendency to promote them, to the Di&s;tinction of your Favour. And who can entertain this de|lightful Reflection, without feeling a Plea&s;ure far &s;uperior to that of the fonde&s;t Author; and of which all true Lovers of their Country mu&s;t participate? To behold the noble&s;t Di&s;po&s;itions of the Prince, and of the Patriot, united: an over|flowing Benevolence, Genero&s;ity, and Candour of Heart, joined to an enlightened Zeal for Liberty, an intimate Per&s;ua&s;ion that on it depends the Hap|pine&s;s and Glory both of Kings and People: to &s;ee the&s;e &s;hining out in Public Virtues, as they have hitherto &s;miled in all the Social Lights and Private Accompli&s;hments of Life, is a Pro&s;pect that cannot but in&s;pire a general Sentiment of Satisfaction and Gladne&s;s, more ea&s;y to be felt than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF the following Attempt to trace Liberty, from the fir&s;t Ages down to her excellent E&s;tabli&s;hment in GREAT BRITAIN, can at all merit your Approbation,
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
and prove an Entertainment to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS; if it can in any Degree an&s;wer the Dignity of the Subject, and of the Name under which I pre&s;ume to &s;helter it; I have my be&s;t Reward: particularly, as it affords me an Oppor|tunity of declaring that I am, with the greate&s;t Zeal and Re&s;pect,</P>
