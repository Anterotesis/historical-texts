<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The Subject propos'd. In&s;cribed to Lady <HI>HERT|FORD.</HI>
This Sea&s;on is de&s;cribed as it affects
the various parts of Nature, a&s;cending from
the lower to the higher; and mixed with Di|gre&s;&s;ions
ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject. Its influence
on inanimate Matter, on Vegetables, on brute
Animals, and la&s;t on Man; concluding with a
Di&s;&s;ua&s;ive from the wild and irregular pa&s;&s;ion
of love, oppo&s;ed to that of a purer and more
rea&s;onable kind.</P>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ubject propos'd. Addre&s;s to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI>
A pro&s;pect of the fields ready for harve&s;t.
Reaping. A tale. A harve&s;t &s;torm. Shooting
and hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous
account of fox-hunting. A view of an orchard.
Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A de&s;cription of
fogs, frequent in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> part of <HI>AUTUMN</HI>:
whence a digre&s;&s;ion, enquiring into the ri&s;e of
fountains, and rivers. Birds of &s;ea&s;on con&s;i|dered,
that now &s;hift their habitation. The
prodigious number of them that cover the nor|thern
and we&s;tern i&s;les of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence
a view of the country. A pro&s;pect of the
dI&s;coloured, fading woods. After a gentle
dusky day, moon-light. Autumnal meteors.
Morning: to which &s;ucceeds a calm, pure,
&s;un-&s;hiNe day, &s;uch as u&s;ually &s;huts up the
&s;ea&s;on. The harve&s;t being gathered in, the
country di&s;&s;olv'd in joy. The whole concludes
with a panegyric on a philo&s;ophical country
