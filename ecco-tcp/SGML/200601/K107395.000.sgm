<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the following POEM had been written by a
Per&s;on who had a Genius equal to the Subject, it
would in a peculiar manner have belong'd to Your
Grace: For to whom &s;hould a Poet &s;ooner ad|dre&s;s
the Prai&s;es of a King, who will be eternally Glo|rious
for the Re&s;toring and Maintaining our Liberties,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
and the common Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to Your
Grace, who has always appear'd &s;o Great a Defender of
them, and has ventur'd, and done, and &s;uffer'd for them
more than any Subject in <HI>England?</HI> The ardent Love of
Liberty and of Your Country, are &s;ome of the many
Heroick Qualities which You have inherited from Your
Noble Ance&s;tors, and &s;ome of the many which Your
Grace has the Happine&s;s to &s;ee deriv'd from Your
Noble Self by the other Hope of Your Augu&s;t Family.
The Wi&s;dom, Fore&s;ight, Re&s;olution, and Greatne&s;s of
Soul that the Brave Lord <HI>Candi&s;h</HI> &s;o con&s;tantly &s;hew'd in
the la&s;t Parliaments of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, will never
be forgotten as long as an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> remains alive.
Ev'n then when it was e&s;teem'd by &s;ome an unpardon|able
Crime to be thought one, even then Your Grace
and that Illu&s;trious Friend, who&s;e Memory &s;hall always
be Dear to all the faithful Lovers of their Country, both
of You heroically dar'd to appear at the Head of <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI>
re&s;olv'd to a&s;&s;ert their Privileges. He gloriou&s;ly
&s;eal'd the Love of his Country with his Blood; but even
after the Lo&s;s of the be&s;t of Friends, Your Grace per&s;e|ver'd
with an undaunted Spirit in the Noble Cau&s;e of
Liberty. Nor could the ju&s;t Grief which You paid
to his Memory, hinder You from paying that Duty
which You ow'd to Your Country, which has always
de&s;ervedly been Your fir&s;t Affection. If &s;ome other
Per&s;ons at that time would have entred into the Wi&s;dom
<PB N="v" REF="4">
of both Your Coun&s;els, You your &s;elves had &s;aved
us without the Help of the King; Your Noble Friend,
as Your Grace's Self, had been one of the living Orna|ments
of Your delivered Country, and there had been
no need of the Revolution, nor perhaps of the long
War that &s;ucceeded it. It was neither His nor Your
Grace's Fault that You were not then &s;ufficiently &s;e|conded,
and con&s;equently that You did not &s;ave the&s;e
Nations all that Blood and Trea&s;ure which the War has
co&s;t them. But when afterwards things were brought
to that Extremity that a Revolution was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
no Man did more than Your Grace towards the
bringing it about, and working our Deliverance that
way. Your Grace was then the mo&s;t Glorious In|&s;trument
of e&s;tabli&s;hing the be&s;t of Kings upon the
Throne of <HI>England,</HI> and defending her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty
at &s;o dangerous a Juncture as that of the Revolution.
She wi&s;ely thought that She could have no where recour&s;e
to a better Place for Her Safety, than where Your Grace
was known to direct by Your Coun&s;els, and to animate
by Your Courage the Brave A&s;&s;ertors of Liberty.</P>
<P>I have a long time de&s;ign'd to lay &s;omething of
mine at Your Grace's Feet, that it might live, and grow
and flouri&s;h under &s;o Illu&s;trious a Patronage. But the
Awe that I &s;tood in of the Force of Your Judgment,
and the Finene&s;s of Your Di&s;cernment, made me wait
for this Opportunity: For I know very well, that I ei|ther
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
ought never to approach You this way at all
or to do it when I can be mo&s;t &s;ecure of my &s;elf. And
tho what I offer You now is far from meriting &s;o High a
Protection, yet I have le&s;s Mi&s;tru&s;t of it than of any
thing I have done in Poetry. Be&s;ides, the De&s;ign and
the Immortal Subject may &s;upply in &s;ome mea&s;ure the
Weakne&s;s of my Performance: For I am confident
that Your Grace will not refu&s;e to grant that Protection
to the Vindication of the King's Memory, which the
King at Your Grace's Reque&s;t granted to the Rights and
Privileges of every <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was writ without any manner
of De&s;ign of obliging or offending a Party. For in
all my Life-time I never de&s;igned either to plea&s;e or of|fend
any, and was always of Opinion that he who makes his Court
to any, is &s;ure to do it to the wrong; for if all Men were for the
Publick Good, there never could be any Party, becau&s;e a Patriot
de&s;igns the Good of his Country, but one of a Party intends his
own.</P>
<P>THE following Poem was writ with an Intention to do what
Service I could to my Country at this Conjuncture; which, as
Mr. <HI>Waller,</HI> has truly ob&s;erved, is a Duty incumbent upon the
Mu&s;es Friend.</P>
<Q><PB N="viii" REF="7">
<L>THE Mu&s;es Friend unto him&s;elf &s;evere,</L>
<L>With &s;ilent Pity looks on all that err.</L>
<L>But if a great, a publick Action &s;hines,</L>
<L>That he rewards with his&punc; Immortal Lines.</L>
<L>Whether it be in Council or in Fight,</L>
<L>His Countries Honour is his chief Delight:</L>
<L>Prai&s;e of great Acts he &s;catters as a Seed,</L>
<L>Which may the like in coming Ages breed.</L></Q>
<P>THIS is certain, that the late King delivered us from a de+plorable
State. Now we who were once in a condition to want
Deliverer, may hereafter be in &s;uch a Condition again; for who
has happened may happen. But &s;ince, as Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> ob&s;erves
mo&s;t Heroes are incited to the noble Acts they perform by a De+&s;ire
of Prai&s;e, who will be at the Trouble to &s;ave or defend
People &s;o ingrateful as to refu&s;e them that?</P>
<P>I DESIRE that the Reader would take two Cautions along
with him: The one that he would not interpret that Love of Libe+ty
which will be found in the following Poem, for an Aver&s;ion
Monarchy; for Liberty is as con&s;i&s;tent with the Government
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
of One as with that of a Thou&s;and. The other is, that he
would by no means mi&s;take the Reflexions upon the Army which
he <HI>Dutch</HI> had in 1672. for a Satyr upon the Nation in ge|neral.
For I have a long time known the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be a Va|iant,
a Wi&s;e and a Great People, and their Country to be one
of the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwarks of the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>IF any one happens to wonder that I have employed &s;o many
Ver&s;es in de&s;cribing the Battel of <HI>Seneffe,</HI> without dwelling
afterwards upon any other of the Glorious Actions of the King,
as the Battel of <HI>Mons,</HI> or that of the <HI>Boyn,</HI> or the Siege of
<HI>Namur:</HI> I de&s;ire him to con&s;ider that in De&s;criptions of all
Fights, there is &s;omething re&s;embling; and by con&s;equence, that
one &s;uch De&s;cription for &s;o &s;hort a work is enough; and that
from among all the Actions of the King I cho&s;e the Battel of
<HI>Seneffe,</HI> becau&s;e of the Brave Army oppo&s;ed to Him, and
the Great Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> who headed them; and becau&s;e
it is the greate&s;t of all the Actions in which the King, or per|haps
any other Captain ever has been engaged; and above all&punc;
becau&s;e the Succe&s;s of the Allies was undeniably due to the King's
Valour and Conduct.</P>
<P>THE following Poem was writ with a De&s;ign of &s;howing the
King and not my &s;elf, and written in the Language not of the
Head but the Heart. 'Tis written in Blank Ver&s;e, and not
in Ryme, not only becau&s;e I thought that the former would
<PB N="x" REF="9">
give me the more Liberty, but for &s;everal other Rea&s;ons which
will offer them&s;elves immediately to all who are Judges of Poetry,
and which &s;ignify nothing to the re&s;t. I will only put the
Reader in mind that Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> looked upon Ryme as a Bon|dage,
and my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> as a
Barbarity. Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> tells us in his Preface to <HI>Paradi&s;e
lo&s;t,</HI> that Ryme is trivial to Judicious Ears, and of no true
Mu&s;ical Delight; and Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> in his Ver&s;es before the
E&s;&s;ay upon tran&s;lated Ver&s;e, that Poetry flouri&s;hed in <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome,</HI>
<Q><L>Till barbarous Nations and more barbarous Times,</L>
<L>Debas'd the Maje&s;ty of Ver&s;e to Rymes.</L></Q>
Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> threw it off in Dramatick Poetry, as Mr. <HI>Mil|ton</HI>
had done in Heroick, and as my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> would
have done, if he had lived to write any more; of which the
following Lines in the E&s;&s;ay upon tran&s;lated Ver&s;e, may be &s;uffici|ent
to &s;atisfy us.</P>
<LG>
<L>OF many Faults Ryme is perhaps the Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Too true to Ryme we &s;light more u&s;eful Laws;</L>
<L>For that in <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> was never known,</L>
<L>Till by <HI>Barbarian</HI> Deluges o'erflown,</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="10">
Subdu'd, undone, they did at la&s;t obey,</L>
<L>And change their own for their Invaders Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I GRANT that from &s;ome Mo&s;&s;y Idol Oak,</L>
<L>In double Rymes our <HI>Thor</HI> and <HI>Woden</HI> &s;poke;</L>
<L>And by Succe&s;&s;ion of unlearned Times,</L>
<L>As Bards began, &s;o Monks rung on the Chimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now that <HI>Phoebus</HI> and the Sacred Nine,</L>
<L>With all their Beams on our ble&s;t I&s;land &s;hine;</L>
<L>Why &s;hould not we their antient Rites re&s;tore,</L>
<L>And be what <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens</HI> were before?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O MAY I live to Hail the Glorious Day,</L>
<L>And &s;ing loud <HI>Peans</HI> thro the crouded Way,</L>
<L>When in Triumphant State the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>True to her&s;elf, &s;hall barbarous Aid refu&s;e,</L>
<L>And in the <HI>Roman</HI> Maje&s;ty appear,</L>
<L>Which none no better, and none come &s;o near.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB REF="11">
FROM what has been &s;aid it is plain, that three of our Poets,
who have been de&s;ervedly celebrated for the Finene&s;s of their
Ears, have condemned and exploded Ryme, not only as an Ene|my
to Art, and a Clog to Genius, and a Deba&s;er of the Maje&s;ty
of Ver&s;e; but as a thing of barbarous Sound, and contrary to
true Mu&s;ical Delight. And I am confident, that tho&s;e three
Gentlemen, if they had been alive, would have been plea&s;ed to
have &s;een in the following Poem, an attempt to &s;econd that ge|nerous
De&s;ign, which the fir&s;t of them began, and which the
two others approved of; a De&s;ign to &s;hake off a barbarous Cu&s;|tom,
and to &s;hew the Harmony of our Mother Tongue (con|trary
to Vulgar received Opinion) above that of our Neigh|bours
the <HI>French,</HI> which is utterly incapable of producing
any thing like Poetical Mu&s;ick without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ryme.</P>
