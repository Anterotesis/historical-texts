<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e Sheets having, with their unhappy Author, fall'n into the Barba|rous and Unju&s;t Hands of the late Mini&s;try, had never &s;een the Light, had not Providence &s;eem'd to re&s;erve them for two Ends:</P>
<P N="1">1. As a &s;tanding Monument of the dext'rous Management of a certain mo&s;t Exqui&s;ite States-man, who&s;e &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny all the&s;e Papers pa&s;t, and yet came home as Things relating to the Author's private Concerns, and with them &s;everal other Manu&s;cripts, which no body but &s;uch an over-vigilant Mini&s;ter would ha' parted with.</P>
<P N="2">2. As a Subject for which there was yet a more proper Juncture coming, when it would be more than ordinary u&s;eful.</P>

<P>The Tendency of this, as of all he writes, is the general Peace of Parties, a Subject never to be &s;ufficiently pur&s;ued and embrac'd by all hone&s;t Men in this Nation, as that without which we are undone at Home, ruin'd Abroad, and mu&s;t, at la&s;t, fall a Prey to the Invading Power of Popery and Foreigners.</P>

<HEAD>Advice to all Parties,</HEAD>
<P>HE that gives his Advice before it is ask'd, expects no Fee for his Coun&s;el; and &s;o the Author of the&s;e Sheets &s;tands clear from the Scandal of Bribery.</P>
<P>If the Gifts of the Spirit qualify a Man for Teaching his Neighbours; by the &s;ame Rule, if any Man knows more than another, he may tell him his Mind, and then every one is free to do what he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Author, tho' he is no profe&s;s'd States-man, may pa&s;s for a gifted Brother that way: If he &s;ays nothing to the purpo&s;e, yet hear him; and if he &s;ays any thing that is to the purpo&s;e, hear him, and no more.</P>
<P>Whatever the World may &s;ay of him, they cannot imagine him to be &s;uch a Fool, as to think he &s;hall plea&s;e every Body. What &s;uits the Wi&s;e Man, won't plea&s;e the Fool: If the Hone&s;t-man is contented, the Knaves will murmur: Peace won't plea&s;e the Soldier, nor Plenty the Farmer: Truth will plea&s;e the Wi&s;e-man; and he that cannot di&s;cern it, is a Fool worth no Body's Notice.</P>
<P>The World is made up of a Conjunction of Contraries, and the Har|mony is the more Admirable: So the Times dilcover a Conjunction of oppo&s;ite Parties, which if they can be brought to keep the Peace, the U|nion wou'd be &s;omething wonderful.</P>
<P>Before we come to talk with the Gentlemen concern'd, 'will be needful to &s;eparate the Parties Sheep and Goats, Birds of a Feather; &s;et every Sort by them&s;elves, with their Characters and De&s;criptions, that all Peo|ple may look out and know them, and look in and know which &s;ort they belong to.</P>
<P>We are at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t divided Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Je&s;t of all the World. The <HI>Polanders</HI> are Fools to us: We have among us, as &s;ome have ob&s;erv'd, three or four and thirty &s;orts of Religions, and twelve or thirteen Severals in Politicks. In Religion, here are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Jews, Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants, Heathens, Pagans, Idolaters,</HI> and <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> wor&s;e than any of them, <HI>Dei&s;ts, Anti-Dei&s;ts, Socinians, Arminians, Pelagians, Gno&s;ticks, Donati&s;ts, Adamites, Sweet-&s;ingers, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, Families of Love, Arians, Antinomians, Free-willers, Seventh-day Men, Univer&s;al Redemption|ers, A&s;gelites, Quieti&s;ts, Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Hugonots, Church of</HI> England <HI>Men</HI> of &s;everal Sorts, <HI>Puritans, Presbyterians, Independants, Anabapti&s;ts, Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</HI> and the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and all <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. If but one Sort of the&s;e are in the right, God knows which Sort that is, and the Lord have Mercy on all the re&s;t. If all Sorts may be in the right, than
<PB N="4" REF="5">
'tis no Matter what Sort a Man's of, and there's no need of any Strife about the Matter.</P>
<P>In Matters of Politicks, the numerous Kinds have obtain'd the Sir-names of <HI>Court-party</HI> and <HI>Country-party, Tories, Whigs, Trimmers, Loyali&s;t, Royali&s;t, Commonwealths-men, Williamites, Jacobites, High Church, Low Church,</HI> and <HI>No Church, Non-Jurants</HI> or <HI>Church-Di&s;&s;enters, Church Whigs,</HI> and abundance of other Sorts, which the Cu&s;tom of the Times have been pleas'd to give Titles to.</P>
<P>But when all the&s;e Names are made u&s;e of, with many more, by way of Contempt upon one another, to &s;hew our Want of Good-nature, as well as Want of Manners; the real unhappy Differences of this Nation &s;eem to lie among the Parties at Court that lately had the Mini&s;try, and tho&s;e that have it now; between the Furio&s;o's in the Church, who are for carrying all before them, and the Moderate Men in the Church, who are for Peace joyn'd with the Di&s;&s;enters, who are for the Liberty they enjoy being pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>To the&s;e Gentlemen the following Advice is directed: If they think 'tis good, they'll accept the Hint, or come under the Cla&s;s of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fools, that hate In&s;truction: If they contemn it, they ought to &s;hew a Rea&s;on for it, or el&s;e they are in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Reach again; <HI>He that judges of a Matter before he hears it, 'tis Folly and Shame unto him.</HI></P>
<P>Temerity in Politicks, is certainly the mo&s;t impolitick thing in the World. Too much Ha&s;te may do Harm, but &s;eldom does Good; and and one would think, the late Reign of King <HI>James</HI> might be a <HI>Memento mori</HI> to all the Sons of <HI>Jehu</HI> either in Church or State.</P>
<P>He is certainly the Friend of &s;uch men, who advi&s;es them to check their Career before they go too far; becau&s;e &s;uch Tempers always run on to their own Confu&s;ion as well as other People's.</P>
<P>But, to tell who I mean without going far about, There's a &s;ort of People among us, who, after their <HI>Tears of Joy</HI> for the Death of King <HI>Willi|am</HI> were dry'd up, began to be comforted very early with the Halcyon Days of Queen <HI>Ann</HI>; and, as if they had made their Conditions with her before Hand, they gave a Loo&s;e to their Pa&s;&s;ions, and di&s;cover their Satis|faction, in the Country Coffee-Hou&s;es, in Terms like the&s;e:&mdash;<HI>Well Boys!</HI> Now <HI>we &s;hall have brave Times again.</HI> Brave Times! &s;ays his ho|ne&s;t Neighbour, who was melancholly &s;till for the Nation's Lois; <HI>Why what's the Matter?</HI> Matter! why, <HI>we have got a Church of</HI> England <HI>Queen, and all the&s;e damn'd Phanaticks will go down again.</HI> We'll have them all <HI>turn'd out now.</HI> We'll have <HI>no more Canting within the Noi&s;e of our Church Bells,</HI> no <HI>Tub-Preaching,</HI> no <HI>Barn-meeting,</HI> no <HI>Whiggi&s;h Ju&s;tices now, that a poor Man can't get a Cup of Beer in his Crown of a Sunday after Sermon, but his Neighbour &s;hall be plaguing him with the Stocks: And if he happen to &s;wear an Oath, or &s;o, to be teaz'd with Informers, that a Man can't take a Gla&s;s of Wine after Sermon, but he &s;hall be Fin'd and Expos'd for it; here has been &s;uch</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">plutter with your</HI> Reformation of Manners <HI>and your</HI> Dutch <HI>Government: We have an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Queen, and a true Church of</HI> England <HI>Queen, and down you go: We'll have your Meeting-Hou&s;es about your Ears quickly.</HI></P>
<P>That this is Matter of Fact, that this was the Di&s;cour&s;e not in the Mouths of here and there a Fool, but of a whole Party, I'll at any time &s;et my Name to the Charge; And I &s;uppo&s;e no Body need put me upon the Proof.</P>
<P>Nor was Her Maje&s;ty's Declaration to her Council, or Speeches to the Parliament, or Her An&s;wers to the Di&s;&s;enters Addre&s;&s;es, of any Weight with the&s;e &s;ort of People; tho' Her Maje&s;ty took ex|ceeding Care, on all Occa&s;ions, to make all Her Subjects ea&s;y, by giving them A&s;&s;urances, Fir&s;t, That She would be a Religious Ob|&s;erver of Her Royal Word; And then giving Her Royal Word, that She would Maintain the Toleration, and give Her Protection to the Di&s;|&s;enters.</P>
<P>Let me tell tho&s;e Gentlemen, that they are guilty of two Crimes; Fir&s;t, great Indi&s;cretion, in &s;hewing their Teeth, before the Muzzle which the Laws have put upon them is taken off, and that they have no Power to bite. Secondly, So much want of Manners and Re&s;pect, that &s;hou'd the Author write half &s;o much Satyr upon the Queen in this Book, 'tis to be thought he wou'd write him&s;elf into <HI>Newgate,</HI> and very well he wou'd de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>What can the Engli&s;h of &s;uch Language be other than this; That the Queen made &s;uch Promi&s;es of Protection to the Di&s;&s;enters, and continuing the Toleration, only to quiet their Minds at Her fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion, and 'till She is Settled in the Throne, or perhaps 'till the War abroad is over; but She does not de&s;ign to keep her Promi&s;e with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m, but they &s;hall all be &s;uppre&s;s'd as &s;oon as Op|portunity offers? And <HI>truly Gentlemen, Her Maje&s;ty is very much be|holden to you.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hort Advice the Author thinks fit to give &s;uch People, is, to hold their Tongues, and have more Manners than affront the Queen at &s;o Im|pudent a Rate; and &s;ince they have &s;hown their good Will, let them be quiet till their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> comes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Her Maje&s;ty being inform'd of their rude|ne&s;s, &s;hou'd think fit to give the Nation a further A&s;&s;urance of Her Ju&s;t|ne&s;s to Her Promi&s;es, by puni&s;hing them for their rai&s;ing a Scandal upon her Veracity.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;ort of People, which the Author pretends to give Advice to, are &s;uch, as upon the Queen's Di&s;&s;olving Her fir&s;t Parliament, and Calling a New one, pretended to tell us what brave things that approaching Par|liament would do for them.</P>
<P>We have now gotten a Church-Parliament, a Loyal Church-of<HI>-England</HI> Parliament, &s;ay they, and now we will do your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and this Parliament &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> us all to Rights again. Now, we'll di&s;mount the Two
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Bulwarks of Whiggi&s;h Hopes; for this Parliament &s;hall repeal the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Toleration, and the Settlement of the Crown: They &s;hall leave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne to be, as it always was, Hereditary, and let Right Line and De&s;cent take place; that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Loyalty may flouri&s;h, and the Pre|rogatives of Princes be no more invaded, nor the Nation be govern'd by <HI>Dutch-</HI>Men and Foreigners.</P>
<P>I believe no Body will di&s;pute with me the Truth of Fact, that this was the Talk, not of a Single Per&s;on, or of a few, but of a Party, their Common, their Table, their Coffee-Hou&s;e Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>How to comment upon &s;uch In&s;olence, I hardly know: This <HI>is an Ini|quity to be puni&s;hed by the Judge.&mdash;</HI>And if the Hou&s;e of Commons did not take Cogni&s;ance of &s;uch People, it was, becau&s;e they re&s;trained their Re&s;entment of &s;uch Affronts more than any Hou&s;e of Commons ever did before them.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t Parliament, the Author has no Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ay any thing of their Religion: But, I think, all our Parliaments have been Church-Parliaments; nor is there any Doubt but they always will be &s;o. But what &s;ort of Doings is this with Parliaments, if they are to be anticipa|ted, led by a Party, and told before-hand what they &s;hall do.</P>
<P>If this &s;ort of People conferr'd with the Members, and concerted with them before-hand, what &s;hould, or &s;hould not, be done; if &s;o, we had then &s;uch a Parliament as never was before.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e Gentlemen did this only to inflame Parties, only to let us &s;ee what they would have done, what De&s;ign they were driving at, 'tis time for the Nation to open their Eyes, and Examine who they are.</P>
<P>The Act of Settlement is the Foundation on which the Nation &s;tands: 'Tis the Sacred Pillar of the pre&s;ent Goverment, and on it may be very well plac'd the <HI>Scotch</HI> Motto, <HI>Nemo me Impune Lace&s;&s;it</HI>: 'Tis the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> near which no Man may approach, without a Bla&s;t from the Breath of the whole Community: This is the <HI>Ark of our I&s;rael,</HI> before which the <HI>Dagon of the</HI> Jure Divino <HI>Men</HI> is fallen, with his Head and his Hands knock'd off: 'Tis the Pede&s;tal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne; which if it be remov'd, the whole Column of the Government &s;inks, and the Capital, which is the pre&s;ent Queen, mu&s;t fall with it: Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty can have no Right to the Crown, if King <HI>James</HI> left a Son, <HI>but by the Act of Settlement.</HI></P>
<P>Now, 'tis worthy of Remark, that the Gentlemen who talk of repeal|ing the Act of Settlement, don't do it barely becau&s;e the Crown is not thereby limited to their liking: But they are for repealing it as a thing not legal in its own Nature; they would have the Parliament di&s;own the Right of Limiting the Crown, and acknowledge a Right of Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> That Kings of all Religions or Principles, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to, if they come of the Race; That the Right Line mu&s;t &s;ucceed, and 'tis not in the Power of the People of <HI>England,</HI> either Collectively or Repre&s;entative|ly,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to que&s;tion their Princes, or to oppo&s;e their Oppre&s;&s;ive unju&s;t Proceed|ings.&mdash;The latent Con&s;equences of this will come in at the la&s;t; <HI>viz.</HI> That the late Revolution was an Act of Rebellion again&s;t God and the King; That it was a Violence offered to God's Vicegerent, again&s;t Ju&s;tice and Allegiance; That King <HI>William</HI> was an Invader of another Man's Right, an U&s;urper, and a Tyrant; and &s;o we are all a-comming, Gentle|men, to the old Point again&s;t <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, Di&s;pen&s;ing Power,</HI> and all the Ab&s;urdities and ridiculous Contradictions of the late Reigns come into Play again, and we have &s;pent thirteen Years War, a Ma&s;s of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, and a Sea of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Blood to a fine purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This is one De&s;ign, in &s;triking at the Act of Settlement; another is to &s;upplant the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they don't like them. They are a&s;hamed to own what they would have; but the Ca&s;e is &s;o plain, that it needs no Comment. A late Author has publi&s;hed the Life of King <HI>James</HI>; and, taking no Notice of this Act, &s;ays, "King <HI>James</HI> died, and left one Son, and two Daughters. Now, what is the Language of this Party? <HI>If we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Queen's reigning before her Brother, becau&s;e &s;he is Crown'd, and has Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we can't help it; but we are</HI> next Oars, <HI>and there is no rea&s;on to expell the re&s;t of his Family; Here is</HI> a Son <HI>and a</HI> Daughter; <HI>we may have them home, make Prote&s;tants of them, and never run up into</HI> Germany <HI>for an old Woman, and her</HI> Dutch <HI>Progeny to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of the De&s;ign, a De&s;ign, which aims at the Root and Fundamental Part of our Con&s;titution; And tho' there is no great Danger of the thing, yet 'tis plain they pu&s;h at it with all their Might.</P>
<P>As to this Act of Settlement: Fir&s;t, The Queen who Reigns by Virtue of &s;uch a Settlement, has not once, but &s;everal times given Her Royal Pro|mi&s;e to maintain it: So that if ever &s;uch an unhappy Time &s;hou'd come, that a Parliament &s;hou'd offer to di&s;annul it, we have Her Maje&s;ties Ho|nour, which we tru&s;t will never for&s;ake her, to have recour&s;e to as a Check to the fatal Mi&s;chief: And if both Queen and Parliament &s;hou'd be &s;o mi&s;taken, and &s;o much Blindne&s;s from above &s;hou'd in Judgment to them be their Portion; the Native Original Right of the People of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> as the Fountain of Power and Government, will come up, and give a Negative to the Execution. What will any new Settlements of the Crown, that may be made, amount to, if the People of <HI>England,</HI> who have an undoubted Right to the Government them&s;elves, &s;hou'd contra|dict them at the Time they wou'd Enter upon the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with this general Negative, <HI>We will not have this Man to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>The Safety of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, re&s;ts in, and depends upon them|&s;elves. <HI>The People of England</HI> are a Security to <HI>the People of England,</HI> for a Pre&s;ervation of all their own E&s;&s;ential Right; and among the re&s;t, this is the chief, to be govern'd by <HI>Princes of their own Nomination,</HI> and Laws of
<PB REF="9">
<HI>their own making.</HI> No Prince can Reign here, but by the Con&s;ent of the People; and by <HI>no Laws,</HI> but &s;uch as become Laws by the Con&s;ent of the People: It has been in vain attempted to bug-bare the Nation into Ville|nage and Va&s;&s;alage; but the Liberties of <HI>England</HI> has always been like the Stone in the Go&s;pel, who&s;oever has fallen again&s;t them, has been broken to pieces; and on whom&s;oever they have fallen, has been groun'd to Powder.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation has not many more Liberties than they had before; but they know them better than they did.</P>
<P>We know now, that <HI>our Princes are circum&s;crib'd</HI> by the Laws and Con|&s;titutions of the Nation, are oblig'd to Govern ju&s;tly, and perform the Sti|pulation of Government declar'd in two Acts of Parliament: We know, that if they I&s;&s;ue out illegal Commands, 'tis no Trea&s;on to di&s;obey. If a Prince &s;hould Levy Money by Arbitrary Authority, any Free-holder may refu&s;e to Pay it, and be guilty of no Crime: If 'tis Levied by Force, he may oppo&s;e it with Force, and yet be no Rebel.</P>
<P>We know the very Parliament them&s;elves can't di&s;pence with the Law, but in a Parliamentary Way: No Law can cea&s;e to be a Law, till repeal|ed by the &s;ame Power that made it; and nothing can have the Force of a Law in <HI>England,</HI> but what has the People's Con&s;ent in Parliament.</P>
<P>The Power of Parliament, and how far the Members are accountable to their Principals, is not for me to determine; but this I venture to &s;ay, that without Doubt a Member of Parliament is to have &s;ome Regard, in Honour, to the Inclination of the People he &s;erves, at lea&s;t, not to act what he knows is contrary to their De&s;ire.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that the Act of Settlement is the mo&s;t Valuable thing in the Government, as the Security we have again&s;t future Slavery: <HI>'Tis the Account we are to give to our Children of our Care for their Safety</HI>: 'Tis the Bulwark of the Nation again&s;t Popery and Tyrany; and none but the Enemies of our Liberties can wi&s;h to &s;ee it Repeal'd. 'Tis our double Security; <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> as it is an Acknowledgment of the People's Power to limit the Crown; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> as it has effectually declared the Right of the Subject, their Liberties, and ju&s;t Priviledes, under &s;uch as &s;hall Reign hereafter.</P>
<P>Some have thought, that the Party in a certain Hou&s;e, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to limit, thwart, and affront the late King <HI>William,</HI> particu|larly as to the Matter of the Army, and afterwards the Grants of Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> while they carried on their private Pique at the King, involun|tarily and unwarily &s;et their Hands to the Peoples Liberties, and made &s;uch Declarations of the Rights of the Subject, as they wou'd be glad to have now undone if they could; if they were led into this by another Party, they were trick'd with a Vengeance: But a Learned Gentleman, who was formerly a great <HI>Jure Divino Man,</HI> was pleas'd to &s;ay of it with an Oath, <HI>We are going to make our &s;elves all Kings, only to cro&s;s one King.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
But let the De&s;ign ha' been what it will, the People's Liberties were Recognized by &s;ome Gentlemen; who, if it &s;hould ha' been told them formerly, <HI>that they &s;hould ha' done &s;o and &s;o,</HI> wou'd ha' an&s;wer'd with the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Captain; <HI>Is thy Servant a Dog,</HI> that he &s;hould do the&s;e things?</P>
<P>To the&s;e, and all the Gentlemen of that Party, who aim at altering the Act of Settlement, our Advice is &s;hort, <HI>Have a Care, Gentlemen, what you do</HI>: Methinks you &s;hould not have the Face to expect, or the Impudence to de&s;ire the Queen to break her Word, the Parliament-Men to Act con|trary to the Intere&s;t and Inclination of the People that cho&s;e them, a Pa|pi&s;t &s;et upon the Throne, a rupudiated Impo&s;tor Acknowledged, an Ab|jur'd Race receiv'd. 'Tis true, all Acts of Parliament may, as Acts, be repeal'd by Parliament; but &s;ome things are in their own Nature to be continued; this can't be repeal'd; if the Queen &s;hou'd break her Word, which 'tis ba&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, even if the Parliament &s;hou'd con&s;ent: <HI>Who &s;hall ab&s;olve us of an Abjuration Oath</HI>? Who &s;hall reconcile the Nation to a <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h Prince? The meaning is only Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tra|ction, and the End will certainly be the de&s;truction of all that &s;hall ever at|tempt it; and therefore I think it as kind a piece of Coun&s;el as can be gi|ven; <HI>Gentlemen, have a Care</HI>; for you will certainly mi&s;carry in the At|tempt. Popery and Slavery will never go down with this Nation: Pope|ry is &s;o formidable a thing, that the very Name of it wou'd &s;et the whole Nation in an Uproar: Tho&s;e that do not under&s;tand it, hate it by Traditi|on; and I believe there is a hundred thou&s;and plain Country-Fellows in <HI>England,</HI> wou'd &s;pend their Blood again&s;t <HI>Popery, that do not know whether it be a Man or a Hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Let &s;uch People therefore <HI>have a Care,</HI> the People of <HI>England</HI> provok'd, are not ea&s;ily appeas'd: Let them remember the Con&s;ternation they were in 16 Years ago, when the Re&s;entment of the People of <HI>England</HI> hung o|ver the Heads of a whole Party: And let them re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd,</P>
<P>The Act of Settlement, and Limitation of the Crown, with the Recog|nition of the Peoples Rights, are the very things the War, the Revoluti|on, and the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of King <HI>James</HI> were made for: The&s;e were the Port the whole Nation &s;teer'd for, and <HI>this Nation will never part with them.</HI> Now, <HI>they are &s;afe,</HI> they can never have any Tyrant, <HI>but by their own Con|&s;ent,</HI> and if they are Slaves again, they mu&s;t do it them&s;elves, and <HI>no body will pity them.</HI></P>
<P>The next &s;ort of People, to whom the&s;e Sheets are directed, by way of Caution or Advice, are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The late Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>To you, Gentlemen, the Author directs him&s;elf without any thing of Satyr; which, con&s;idering how you treated him, you might rea&s;onably expect; but &s;tating your Ca&s;e as it really is, refers you to your &s;elves, to reflect upon the profound Policy of your Ways.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty taking you for wi&s;e Men, as well as hone&s;t Men, com|committed to your Conduct the guiding of her Affairs: War abroad,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Peace at home, Her Maje&s;ty's Glory, the Nation's Happine&s;s, were all in your Power: You had what <HI>Solomon</HI> calls a Price put into your Hands, and <HI>Solomon,</HI> not I, &s;hall tell you what you ought to be thought, for not making &s;uch Improvement of it, as God and the Nation expected from you.</P>
<P>That you were the hone&s;t Men the Queen expected you to be, let the An&s;wers you gave to the Propo&s;als for relieving the <HI>Cami&s;ars,</HI> the Expedi|tion to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> the Management of the Victualing-Office, the Army and Navy, in too many Particulars to be innumerated here, &s;peak for you, if they can; the Forfeiture of your Honour and Word on &s;undry Occa&s;ions, the Conniv'd Corre&s;pondencies with the Enemy, and the like, let them an|&s;wer for the Matter: That your Con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom deceiv'd her Ma|je&s;ty, who&s;e Goodne&s;s had Entertain'd better Thoughts of you, than your Merit gave Rea&s;on for, will too plainly appear in the weak Attempts made to cover the farther Di&s;hone&s;ty of your De&s;igns in pu&s;hing this Nation in|to all manner of Feuds, Heats, Animo&s;ities, and Strife of Parties, to the no &s;mall Confu&s;ion of the Publick Affairs, and hazarding the Publick Peace.</P>
<P>How you would have extricated her Maje&s;ty and this Nation out of the Labyrints of Error, and the Impolicies you were driving the Publick Affairs into, we thank her Maje&s;ty's Prudence that &s;he did not think fit to expect, not thinking it &s;afe to run the ri&s;que of calling you Fools at the Price of &s;ome Mi&s;chiefs too gro&s;s to be born with, and too late to be remedied.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, that her Maje&s;ty, finding both the Di&s;hone&s;ty and Folly of your Management, and fore&s;eeing the precipiece on which you had brought the Public Affairs, had both the Wi&s;dom and the Courage to take the Reins out of your Hands before you had quite over-turn'd the Chariot of the State, and before you had hurried both us and your &s;elves into Gulfs of irretrievable Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The humble Advice of the Author of the&s;e Sheets to you, is, To &s;it down and be quiet, thank God on your Knees, Night and Day, that you had a mild, a merciful, and a gentle Mi&s;tre&s;s, that let you fall &s;oftly, and did not tye the Weight of the Law to your Heels, which would have &s;unk you to the Bottom of that Gulf, in which fal&s;e Favourites have generally fallen in all Ages of the World.</P>
<P>Thank God and the Queen, That Her Maje&s;ty did not give you time to ruia your &s;elves, but took the Knife out of your Hand, before you did that Mi&s;chief with it that mu&s;t at la&s;t have fallen with a double Weight on your own Heads.</P>
<P>Mad-men and Fools are always taken care of by their Friends, mi&s;chie|vous Weapons taken from them; and if they are not peaceably di&s;pos'd, are frequently lock'd up from any Capacity of injuring them&s;elves or others.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty could never have an&s;wer'd it to her own known Prudence and Judgment, to have committed the Power of your own Ruin, and the Nation's Di&s;turbance, any longer to you: For when once the State-Frenzy appear'd, and all the fatal Plague-Tokens of Lunacy and National Di&s;tra|ction
<PB N="11" REF="12">
broke out in your Behaviour, the Queen as a true Nur&s;ing Mother to you, gave you a Rece&s;s from Public Employment, that you might have time to &s;have your Under&s;tandings, di&s;cipline your Tempers, and put your poli|tick Capacities under a Cour&s;e of State Phy&s;ick, might recover your Sen&s;es a little, and, if po&s;&s;ible, with Time and Reflections, come to your &s;elves again.</P>
<P>How kind has her Maje&s;ty been to you Gentlemen! that when you had ab&s;olutely hang'd your &s;elves in the State-Noo&s;e, had actually tied the Rope of Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences about your Necks, and had you gone on but a few moments more, mu&s;t have been hamper'd irretrievably, and been quite &s;trangl'd with the Exten&s;ion of your own Politicks; at once the kind hand of your Sovereign cut you down before your breath was quite gone, brought you to Life again, and delivered you from tho&s;e dangerous Wilderne&s;&s;es and Mazes of State-Affairs; the Conduct of which you never under&s;tood, and has now given you the Happine&s;s of a calm Rece&s;s, and fair Warning not to meddle any more with Things out of your Sphere.</P>
<P>Keep the Anniver&s;ary of your Deliverance, Gentlemen, and let it never be forgotten: Remember it with Thankfulne&s;s to the Queen, to the Glory of her Maje&s;ty's Lenity and Tenderne&s;s, and think &s;ometimes how impo&s;&s;ible it had been but that the Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;tractions you were pu&s;hing this Na|tion upon, mu&s;t have ended in Committing you <HI>the In&s;truments of it</HI> to the Hands of that Ju&s;tice which &s;ome of you, by the unexpected Happine&s;s of Revolution-Clemency, had the good Fortune to e&s;cape from once before.</P>
<P>My third Advice is to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly the Clergy may di&s;dain to be advis'd, at lea&s;t by me, as Per&s;ons who&s;e Province it is, to give, not receive Admonition: But none ought to refu&s;e Advice, but he that has never been mi&s;taken; <HI>and I hope, Gentlemen, you will not pretend to be the Men.</HI> You have now your Day, <HI>as</HI> A&s;hton <HI>&s;aid lately, every Body has.</HI> The Queen has declared her &s;elf of your Side, and that tho' others &s;hall have her Protection, you &s;hall have her Favour.</P>
<P>The humble Advice to you, Gentlemen, is, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To De&s;erve it. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> Be contented with it.</P>
<P>De&s;erve it by being Faithful to her, and to your Native Country; for 'tis a mo&s;t certain Truth, no Man can be a Faithful Subject to the Queen, who is not intirely in the Intere&s;t of his Native Country.</P>
<P>By this I mean (for I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood) No Man can be a Faithful Subject to the pre&s;ent Queen, and de&s;erve her Favour, who de&s;igns or de|&s;ires to overthrow the Peace of the Nation &s;he Governs, to overthrow the Foundation on which it &s;tands, that wou'd endeavour to bring in a Popi&s;h Race to Reign over us, and con&s;equently involve the Nation in Blood and Confu&s;ion. 'Tis not enough to &s;ay they de&s;ign no Alteration during the Queen's Life, but to keep out Foreigners: There is nothing &s;o Foreign to this Nation as Popery. The Church of <HI>England</HI> were the Men which threw it out; and how it can be, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men &s;hou'd run a Venture of its returning, is pa&s;t my Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
'Tis true, every thing that is done by the Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is not done by the Church; a lame Shift lately made u&s;e of by a certain Gentleman, to throw off the Scandal of Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience.</P>
<P>But, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that Gentleman, he might have an&s;wer'd the Author of the New Te&s;t of the Church's Loyalty better than &s;o, or he had as good have &s;aid nothing: For, I think, in Arguing, we may take the Principles of a Church from the Writings of her Doctors, who are the Ex|plainers of them, as well as from her Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith: Now he owns that the Doctors of the Church have Preached &s;uch a Doctrine; if it be a Doctrine not agreeable to the Canon, then they ought to have been reprov'd by the Dioce&s;an, and Puni&s;hed by Su&s;pen&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e. But however, 'tis &s;ufficient to the Argument <HI>and therefore the Di&s;tinction was needle&s;s,</HI> that whether it is an Article of the Church's Faith or no, 'tis a Doctrine was Preach'd by the Learned Doctors of the Church, univer&s;ally received by the Members of the Church, defended openly, profe&s;s'd and acknowledg'd by tho&s;e Gentlemen that have been, and are &s;till e&s;teem'd Fathers and Pillars of the Church, and this is &s;ufficient to the Point.</P>
<P>Now, in this re&s;pect, what is done by the Members of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and none el&s;e, is in the Sen&s;e of the Argument done by the Church, tho' it be not a publick Act of Convocation, or an Act of Delegates from the Church.</P>
<P>In this Sen&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI> Depo&s;ed K. <HI>James,</HI> and yet they ne|ver made an Act of Convocation for it, but 'twas the Church of <HI>England</HI> part of the Nation did it; and thus I am to be under&s;tood here, without putting any one to the Trouble of Exerci&s;ing his Logick upon the Point.</P>
<P>In this Sen&s;e too I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in all I &s;hall &s;ay of 'em, or to 'em: I am not Di&s;cu&s;&s;ing their Articles of Faith, I like them very well, and wi&s;h they wou'd &s;tick clo&s;e to them them&s;elves; nor am I &s;ingling out their Clergy to Reproach them with their Immorali|ties, of which, perhaps, there may be cau&s;e enough, <HI>aye, and in other Clergy too</HI>; but I'm directing my di&s;cour&s;e to the whole Body of this Nation, who call them&s;elves of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and 'tis to them I &s;ay, that who|ever goes about to Introduce a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of this Pro|te&s;tant Nation, who&s;oever de&s;igns to re&s;tore the Abdicated Line of the late King, can't de&s;erve the Favour which her Maje&s;ty has promis'd them, and which, I can't but &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he promis'd them <HI>with a Sub-Intelligitur</HI> of their Faithfulne&s;s to her and the Nation.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is the Foundation on which her Maje&s;ty and the Nation now &s;tands, and without which they cannon &s;tand; of which may be &s;aid, without Prophanene&s;s, as is &s;aid of the Go&s;pel, <HI>other Foundati|on can no Man lay than that which is laid.</HI></P>
<P>2. As I would advi&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI> to de&s;erve this Favour of their Prince, &s;o I advi&s;e them to be contented with it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems a Manife&s;t Affront to the Queen's Declaration that when &s;he has promis'd them her Favour, and the Di&s;&s;enters her Protection, they &s;hou'd
<PB N="13" REF="14">
not be contented with the Fir&s;t, without depriving tother of the La&s;t. What &s;hall we &s;ay? that while the Queen declares &s;he will protect her Di&s;&s;enting Subjects in their Liberty of Wor&s;hip, it &s;hall be hindred from the Pulpit, and afterwards from the Collegiate Pre&s;s at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that 'tis the Duty of all true Chur. of <HI>England</HI> Men to Erect a Flag of Defiance again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, or Phanaticks, till they are Rooted from off the Face of the Land: Why, what's the matter Gentlemen? won't you let the Queen keep her Word with them? &s;he has promi&s;ed upon her Royal Word to pre&s;erve the Tolera|tion, and you declare &s;he &s;hall not. This is very &s;coundrel u&s;age of her Ma|je&s;ty, and a &s;orry return for the Favour &s;he has promis'd you. I que&s;tion not but you will come in with the Shift ju&s;t now mentioned, That this is not an Act of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; but Gentlemen as you ought to be a&s;ham'd of it, let us &s;ee you Correct it, or el&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e your tacit acknowledg|ments is an A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Here are in <HI>England,</HI> by a mode&s;t E&s;timation, above two Millions of Di&s;&s;enters; I would fain ask the hotte&s;t headed Church of <HI>England</HI> Man in Town, what he wou'd have done with them?</P>
<P><HI>Hang'd,</HI> all <HI>Hang'd, &s;ays furio&s;o,</HI> Ay, Sir, if you cou'd fight as well as talk, it may be you might do it; <HI>But they won't be Hang'd,</HI> and how will you make them? 'twas try'd once, and nothing was got by it but Blows, and that Two for One.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e you would Bani&s;h them, and <HI>Suppo&s;e they wou'd go,</HI> 'twou'd Ruin you all to part with them. See what a Condition <HI>Spain</HI> brought it &s;elf to, by &s;ending 170000 Families of Mare&s;coes away.</P>
<P>They're not only Numerous but Wealthy, your Trade wou'd remove with 'em, they'd carry with 'em &s;o much of your Ca&s;h and Wealth, you'd be in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e than the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> left the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ladies in, without their Jewels.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee the Policy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Di&s;&s;enters; 'tis certainly more for the Nations Good to Unite all Parties; there can be but one thing in it; Convert them they can't; I never read of any Conver&s;ion brought about by Per&s;ecution but in <HI>France,</HI> and what are New Converts turn'd to? only to &s;ubmit for Fear.</P>
<P>Now without pretending to Prophe&s;y, I may &s;ay, the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land</HI> are not to be brought to that, the only thing that remains, is, they wou'd have the re&s;traint of the Law taken off, that they may be loo&s;e upon them to harra&s;s and plunder them, this is what is aim'd at.</P>
<P>Well Gentlemen, when you have this Liberty you dare not put it in Pra|ctice further than the Law will give you leave; if you do, the Law gives them leave to re&s;i&s;t you, and in either, there is half your own Party will be again&s;t you; Nay, tho&s;e who are properly the Ch. of <HI>England</HI> will be a|gain&s;t it, all the Men of Honour, Con&s;cience, Charity and Mercy will be a|gain&s;t harra&s;&s;ing and dragging their Neighbours about for Points of Con&s;ci|ence: Nay, the Mob of your own Party will &s;tone your Informers; and who are you that are left, if the other &s;hou'd &s;tand Neuter? can you Force the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Queen to break her Word? are ye able to fright her into it? and if you cou'd, when you have driven all the Nation into Confu&s;ion, can you defend your &s;elves again&s;t the Laws and the Party.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e than is all this Huffing, is it not only that you want to be Plundring your Neighbours? Why, if you are for Plunder, take Arms a God's Name, and go and Plunder the French.&mdash;But I ask Pardon, I forgot your Principles, <HI>you are for Plunder without Fighting.</HI></P>
<P>The farther Confirmation of this Advice, is drawn from the plain Conviction, which the powerful Arguments of Peace, Temper and Mo|deration have forc'd on the Minds of Men.</P>
<P>You now &s;ee Gentlemen, the Queen, the Head of your own Church, the Bi&s;hops, a numerous part of your own Body, the Men of the Gown, they are all convinc'd.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for Wi&s;e Men to re&s;i&s;t Demon&s;tration, the con&s;equence of things has brought, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, all the Wi&s;e Men of the Church, and I would to God it were true, to &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of Peace, to &s;ee that a Union of Parties is the only &s;tep to this Nations Settlement, that a Rece&s;s from Party Rage, and healing the Wounds of the State, is the only Method to prevent the Nations falling into Convul&s;ions, Feavers, Calenturs, and Death.</P>
<P>And why, Gentlemen, will you &s;tand out? it were to be wi&s;h'd you would a little con&s;ider how is it po&s;&s;ible you can Erect your own Judg|ments again&s;t a whole Nation, the Queen, the Nobility, Thou&s;ands of your be&s;t Pari&s;honers, born, bred in, and ever true to the Church, are con|vinc'd, and will you not be mov'd to Examine the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>What pro&s;pect of Injury or Mi&s;chief can you &s;ee in Peace? what da|mage can accrue to the Church or State, to put but a Negative upon your Zeal, and not &s;uffer it to out-run the Law, or Fight with your knowledge.</P>
<P>As you Love the Church, your Prince, and your Country, li&s;ten to Peace, li&s;ten to the Voice of the Nation, and of the Queen, and the Voice of Rea|&s;on, and the Nature of the things, all concur to call upon you to Unite with your Brethren, and no more let &s;mall things divide us, no more let our E|nemies beat us with our own Hands, and de&s;troy us by our own A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If you will not give Ear to this Cordial Advice, give the Author leave to determine two Things, which without any pretence to the Spirit of Prophe&s;y, he thinks he may pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ure you of.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Nation, who&s;e Eyes are now open to their own Safety and Deliverance, will do the Work without you, the People of <HI>England,</HI> aided by the Laws, encouraged by the Nobility, the principal Gentry, a great Bo|dy of the Clergy, and back'd by the Queen, joining in this mighty work, this glorious attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a Party Peace, will do the work without you.</P>
<P N="2">2. You will fix this Eternal Brand of Infamy on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy, that they were the principal Oppo&s;ers of the Nation's Peace; that in Contempt
<PB N="15" REF="16">
of the Ble&s;&s;ed healing and heavenly Spirit of Peace, in &s;pight of the Roy|al Exhortations and Invitations of their Sovereign in Defiance of the no|ble Example of their Brethren, they, even they only, are at this Day the wideners of our Breaches, the Encouragers of Divi&s;ions, and the daily prompters of the Ignorant People to abhor their Brethren, to hate their Neighbours, and to keep up the unnatural Divi&s;ions of this Nation.</P>
<P>A ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Memorandum</HI> this will be to the Honour and Glory of our In|feriour Clergy, to remain to Po&s;terity, when our Children &s;hall &s;ay, We had been a happy Nation, if the Clergy of the Church had not hindred the general Peace in 1705, when the Queen, the Nobility, the Gentry, nay, and the very Bi&s;hops offer'd to join in a happy Union, when they all invited them to it; when all Circum&s;tances concurr'd to make them ea&s;y, and when the want of it let in Slavery and Bondage upon our Fathers, and entailed it upon us their Po&s;tery.</P>
<P>To the moderate Gentlemen of the Church, the Author of this &s;ees but little Occa&s;ion to &s;peak; the whole need not the Phy&s;icians; he that is in the right Way needs no Guide. Peace has brought &s;ome Scandal upon you, but 'tis from &s;uch Mouths who&s;e Breath is all Scandal, and who&s;e Throaths is an open Sepulchre.</P>
<P>Pur&s;ue, Gentlemen, with the &s;ame Courage and Candor, the &s;ame happy Re&s;olutions, and &s;ucce&s;sful Mea&s;ures you have begun; how ea&s;y is the Work of Peace in <HI>England,</HI> when by wi&s;e Hands, back with the Encou|ragement of Power, it is once &s;et on foot.</P>
<P>Go on, Gentlemen, with Succe&s;s; Peace is always the fir&s;t Act of wi&s;e Coun&s;els: What Confu&s;ions have our State Mountebanks runs us into?

<P>You have re&s;cued the Nation; God Almighty, by infu&s;ing Principles of Peace, Moderation, Union, and Temper into the Heads and Hearts of the Queen and you, has &s;av'd us from the Ruin contriv'd for us by the Devil, and unwarily propogated <HI>to treat them with Charity,</HI> by our own Impolitick and thoughle&s;s Managers.</P>
<P><HI>The Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are another Branch of tho&s;e who this Author, with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to their politicks, thinks may accept of &s;ome Advice, tho' per|haps they may be of another Opinion.</P>
<P>However, whether they will hear or forbear, he takes the Freedom to &s;peak to them, tho' in general, only referring a further Explication of his Meaning to another place.</P>
<P>You have always, and above all Parties, pretended to peace: Now &s;hew the reality of your De&s;ign.</P>
<P>You are divided in &s;ome Steps which <HI>you think needful</HI> from the Church; let the Spirit of Charity remain, and divide no farther than you really know to be needful.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
In Matters of Religion, enjoying your Liberty, be content with it, and &s;tudy to let there be no more Difference between you and the Church, than there really is.</P>
<P>We are all Chri&s;tians, all Prote&s;tants, all Engli&s;hmen, let us be all Bre|thren, and act like &s;uch on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters have but one Intere&s;t, one Foundation, and but one End: The Moderate Church-Men, and the cha|ritable Di&s;&s;enter, are the &s;ame Denomination of Chri&s;tians, and all the Difference which now lookt at near the Eye &s;hows large, if view'd at the di&s;tance of Heaven &s;hows not it &s;elf; neither will Catholick Chri&s;tianity, in that Realm of Light, appear in any Party-colour'd Garment.</P>
<P>In Civil Affairs, 'tis your Intere&s;t, your Safety, and your Glory, that the Government &s;hould be in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and even this is a Se|curity to the Di&s;&s;enters again&s;t all that Clamour rais'd at them, of their pulling down the Church. The Di&s;&s;enters cannot wi&s;h the Downfal of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Governments, without proving them&s;elves Lunatick, and all the Sen&s;e of their own Intere&s;t mu&s;t for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>In all Occa&s;ions therefore, with all po&s;&s;ible chearfulne&s;s, join with the Men of Peace of the Church; carefully choo&s;e them to repre&s;ent you; bold|ly re&s;cue them from the Scandals and Calumnies of their own Clamouring high Party, and heartily a&s;&s;i&s;t them upon all Occa&s;ions in their hone&s;t and ju&s;t Endeavours for the Nation's Security.</P>
<P>What if every body you &s;u&s;pect or di&s;like is not turn'd out, or every body you like put in? What if Her Maje&s;ty is willing to try &s;ome Men longer than others, and give Knaves an Opportunity to turn hone&s;t? what if the Revolution of <HI>England</HI> from Mad-men and Fools in the Mini&s;try, to hone&s;t and wi&s;e Men, be acted like the Moderation we recommend, with Temper, &s;edately, gradually, and with due Con&s;ideration to Circum&s;tances: Being once fully &s;atisfy'd with the &s;incere Re&s;olution of the Queen and Mini&s;try, to pur&s;ue the Nation's Peace, acquie&s;ce in Her Maje&s;ties Methods: Her De&s;igns being &s;o ju&s;t, fear not but the Methods will be as judicious. Our Saviour's Redemption was all compleat, tho' he did not An&s;wer the ha&s;ty Expectation of the Di&s;ciples, who thought he mu&s;t needs <HI>ju&s;t then</HI> re&s;tore the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen has &s;ufficiently declar'd Her glorious Re&s;olution for Peace; pray let us leave Her Maje&s;ty to Her own Methods: It is not two Year ago &s;ince we we &s;hould have thought our &s;elves happy with what we now &s;ee; let us look on our pre&s;ent Liberty and Peace with Satisfaction, and wait with Joy and Plea&s;ure for the Remainder, which in its Time and Sea&s;on we have great Rea&s;on to hope will be perfected, to the Settlement of that la&s;ting Calm in the&s;e Nations, which Good Men have &s;o long pray'd for:</P>
