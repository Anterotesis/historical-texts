<P>THAT wonder is the effect of ig|norance, has been often ob&s;erved. The awful &s;tilne&s;s of attention, with which the mind is over&s;pread at the fir&s;t view of an unexpected effect or uncommon performance, cea&s;es when we have lei&s;ure to di&s;entangle complications and inve&s;tigate cau&s;es. Wonder is a pau&s;e of rea&s;on, a &s;ud|den ce&s;&s;ation of the mental progre&s;s, which la&s;ts only while the under&s;tanding is fixed upon &s;ome &s;ingle Idea; and is at an end when it recovers force enough to divide the object into its parts, or mark the intermediate gradations from the fir&s;t motive to the la&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IT may be remarked with equal truth, that ignorance is often the effect of wonder. It is common for tho&s;e who have never ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="2" REF="3">
them&s;elves to the labour of enquiry, nor invigorated their confidence by any con|que&s;ts over difficulty, to &s;leep in the gloomy quie&s;cence of a&s;toni&s;hment, without any effort to animate languor or di&s;pel ob&s;curity. What they cannot immediately conceive, they con|&s;ider as too high to be reached, or too exten|&s;ive to be comprehended; They therefore content them&s;elves with the gaze of igno|rance, and forbearing to attempt what they have no hopes of performing, re&s;ign the plea|&s;ure of rational contemplation to more perti|nacious &s;tudy or more active faculties.</P>
<P>AMONG the productions of mechanic art, many are of a form &s;o different from that of their fir&s;t materials, and many con&s;i&s;t of parts &s;o numerous and &s;o nicely adapted to each other, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider them without amazement. But when we enter the &s;hops of artificers, ob&s;erve the va|rious tools by which every operation is facili|tated, and trace the progre&s;s of a manufacture through the different hands that in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other, contribute to its perfection, we &s;oon di&s;cover that every &s;ingle man has an ea&s;y ta&s;k, and that the extremes however
<PB N="3" REF="4">
remote of natural rudene&s;s and artificial ele|gance, are joined by a regular concatenation of effects, of which every one is introduced by that which precedes it, and equally introduces that which is to follow.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame is the &s;tate of intellectual and manual performances. A long calculation or a complex diagram affrights the timorous and unexperienced from a &s;econd view; but if we have &s;kill &s;ufficient to anali&s;e them into &s;imple principles, it will generally be di&s;co|vered that our fear was groundle&s;s. <HI>Divide and conquer,</HI> is a principle equally ju&s;t in &s;cience as in policy. Complication is a &s;pecies of confederacy, which, while it con|tinues united, bids defiance to the mo&s;t active and vigorous intellect; but of which every member is &s;eparately weak, and which may therefore be quickly &s;ubdued if it can once be broken.</P>
<P>THE chief art of learning, as <HI>Locke</HI> has ob&s;erved, is to attempt but little at a time. The farthe&s;t excur&s;ions of the mind are made by &s;hort &s;lights frequently repeated, the mo&s;t lo&s;ty fabricks of &s;cience are formed by the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
continued accumulation of &s;ingle propo|&s;itions.</P>
<P>IT often happens, whatever be the cau&s;e, that this impatience of labour or dread of mi&s;carriage, &s;eizes tho&s;e who are mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion; and that they who might with greate&s;t rea&s;on promi&s;e them&s;elves victory, are lea&s;t willing to hazard the encounter. This diffidence, where the attention is not laid a&s;leep by lazi|ne&s;s or di&s;&s;ipated by plea&s;ures, can ari&s;e only from confu&s;ed and general views &s;uch as negligence &s;natches in ha&s;te, or from the di&s;|appointment of the fir&s;t hopes formed by ar|rogance without reflection. To expect that the intricacies of &s;cience will be pierced by a carele&s;s glance, or the eminences of fame a&s;|cended without labour, is to expect a pecu|liar privilege, a power denied to the re&s;t of Mankind; but to &s;uppo&s;e that the maze is in&s;crutable to diligence, or the heights in|acce&s;&s;ible to pre&s;everance, is to &s;ubmit tamely to the tyranny of fancy, and enchain the mind in voluntary &s;hackles.</P>
<P>IT is the proper ambition of the Heroes in literature to enlarge the boundaries of know|ledge
<PB N="5" REF="6">
by di&s;covering and conquering new re|gions of the intellectual world. To the &s;uc|ce&s;s of &s;uch undertakings perhaps &s;ome de|gree of fortuitous happine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary, which no man can promi&s;e or procure to him&s;elf; and therefore doubt and irre&s;olution may be forgiven in him that ventures into the un|trodden aby&s;&s;es of truth, and attempts to find his way through the fluctuations of un|certainty, and the conflicts of contradiction. But when nothing more is required, than to pur&s;ue a path already beaten, and to trample ob&s;tacles which others have demoli&s;hed, why &s;hould any man &s;o much &s;u&s;pect his own intellect as to imagine him&s;elf unequal to the attempt?</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed that they who de|vote their lives to &s;tudy would at once believe nothing too great for their attainment, and con&s;ider nothing as too little for their regard; that they would extend their notice alike to &s;cience and to life, and unite &s;ome knowledge of the pre&s;ent world to-their acquaintance with pa&s;t ages and remote events.</P>
<P>NOTHING has &s;o much expo&s;ed Men of learning to contempt and ridicule, as their ig|norance
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of things which are known to all but them&s;elves, and their inability to conduct common negotiations, or extricate their af|fairs from trivial perplexities. Tho&s;e who have been taught to con&s;ider the in&s;titutions of the &s;chools, as giving the la&s;t perfection to human abilities, are &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee men wrinkled with &s;tudy, yet wanting to be in|&s;tructed in the minute circum&s;tances of pro|priety, or the nece&s;&s;ary forms of daily tran&s;acti|on; and quickly &s;hake off their reverence for modes of education, which they find to pro|duce no ability above the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>BOOKS,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Bacon, can never teach the u&s;e of books.</HI> The &s;tudent mu&s;t learn by com|merce with mankind to reduce his &s;pecula|tions to practice, and accommodate his know|ledge to the purpo&s;es of life.</P>
<P>IT is too common for tho&s;e who have been bred to &s;chola&s;tic profe&s;&s;ions and pa&s;&s;ed much of their time in academies where nothing but learning confers honours, to di&s;regard every other qualification, and to imagine tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they &s;hall find mankind ready to pay ho|mage
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to their knowledge, and to croud about them for in&s;truction. They, therefore, &s;tep out from their cells into the open world, with all the confidence of authority and dignity of importance; they look round about them at once with ignorance and &s;corn on a race of beings to whom they are equally unknown and equally contemp|tible, but who&s;e manners they mu&s;t imitate, and with who&s;e opinions they mu&s;t comply, if they de&s;ire to pa&s;s their time happily a|mong them.</P>
<P>TO le&s;&s;en that difdain with which &s;cholars are inclined to look on the common bu|&s;ine&s;s of the world, and the unwillingne&s;s with which they conde&s;cend to learn what is not to be found in any &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider that though admiration is excited by ab&s;tru&s;e re&s;earches and remote di&s;coveries, we cannot hope to give plea&s;ure, or to conciliate affection, but by &s;ofter accompli&s;hments, and by qualities more ea&s;ily communicable to tho&s;e about us. He that can only conver&s;e upon que&s;tions, about which only a &s;mall part of mankind has knowledge &s;ufficient to be curious, mu&s;t pa&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="9">
his days in un&s;ocial &s;ilence, and live in the crowd of life without a companion. He that can only be u&s;eful in great occa&s;ions, may die without exerting his abilities, and &s;tand a helple&s;s &s;pectator of a thou&s;and vexations which fret away the happine&s;s of being, and which nothing is required to remove but a little dexterity of conduct and readine&s;s of expedients.</P>
<P>No degree of knowledge attainable by man is able to &s;et him above the want of hourly a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to extingui&s;h the de&s;ire of fond endearments, and tender officiou&s;ne&s;s; and therefore, no one &s;hould think it unnece&s;&s;ary to learn tho&s;e arts by which friend&s;hip may be gained. Kindne&s;s is pre&s;erved by a con|&s;tant reciprocation of benefits or interchange of plea&s;ures; but &s;uch benefits only can be be&s;towed, as others are capable to receive, and &s;uch plea&s;ures only imparted, as others are qualified to enjoy.</P>
<P>BY this de&s;cent from the pinacles of art no honour will be lo&s;t; for the conde&s;cen|&s;ions of learning are always overpaid by gra|titude. An elevated genius employed in little
<PB N="9" REF="10">
things, appears, to u&s;e the &s;imile of <HI>Longinus,</HI> like the &s;un in his evening declination, he re|mits his &s;plendor but retains his magnitude, and plea&s;es more, though he dazzles le&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I cannot deny that the contempt with which you have treated the annual migrations of the gay and bu&s;y part of mankind, is ju&s;tified by daily ob&s;erva|tion, &s;ince mo&s;t of tho&s;e who leave the town, neither vary their entertainments nor enlarge their notions; yet I &s;uppo&s;e you do not in|tend to repre&s;ent the practice it&s;elf as ridicu|lous, or to declare that he who&s;e condition, puts the di&s;tribution of his time into his own power, may not properly divide it between the town and country.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
THAT the country, and only the country di&s;plays the inexhau&s;tible varieties of nature, and &s;upplies the philo&s;ophical mind with matter for admiration and enquiry, never was denied; but my curio&s;ity is very little attracted by the colour of a flower, the ana|tomy of an in&s;ect, or the the &s;tructure of a ne&s;t; my attention is generally employed up|on human manners, and I therefore &s;ill up the months of rural lei&s;ure with remarks on tho&s;e who live within the circle of my no|tice. If Writers would more frequently vi&s;it tho&s;e regions of negligence and liberty, they might often diver&s;ify their repre&s;entations, and multiply their images, for in the coun|try are original characters chiefly to be found. In cities, and yet more in courts, the minute di&s;criminations which di&s;tingui&s;h one from another are for the mo&s;t part effaced, the peculiarities of temper and opinion are gra|dually worn away by promi&s;cuous conver&s;e, as angular bodies and uneven &s;urfaces lo&s;e their points and a&s;perities by frequent attrition again&s;t one another, and approach by degrees to uniform rotundity. The prevalence of fa&s;hion, the influence of example, the de&s;ire
<PB N="11" REF="12">
of applau&s;e, and the dread of cen&s;ure, ob|&s;truct the natural tendencies of the mind, and check the fancy in in its fir&s;t efforts to break forth into experiments of caprice.</P>
<P>FEW inclinations are &s;o &s;trong as to grow up into habits, when they mu&s;t &s;truggle with the con&s;tant oppo&s;ition of &s;ettled forms and e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms. But in the country e|very man is a &s;eparate and independent be|ing; &s;olitude flatters irregularity with hopes of &s;ecrecy; and wealth removed from the mortification of compari&s;on and the awe of equality, &s;wells into contemptuous confi|dence, and &s;ets blame and laughter at defi|ance; the impul&s;es of nature act unre&s;trained, and the di&s;po&s;ition dares to &s;hew it&s;elf in its true form, without any di&s;gui&s;e of hypocri&s;y, or decorations of elegance. Every one indul|ges the full enjoyment of his own choice, and talks and lives with no other view than to plea&s;e him&s;elf, without enquiring how far he deviates from the general practice, or con|&s;idering others as entitled to any account of his &s;entiments or actions. If he builds or demoli&s;hes, opens or enclo&s;es, deluges or drains, it is not his care what may be the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
opinion of tho&s;e who are &s;killed in per&s;pec|tive or architecture, it is &s;ufficient that he has no landlord to control him, and that none has any right to examine in what projects the lord of the manor &s;pends his own money on his own grounds?</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on it is not very common to want &s;ubjects for rural conver&s;ation. Al|mo&s;t every man is daily doing &s;omething which produces merriment, wonder or re|&s;entment, among his neighbours. This utter exemption from re&s;traint leaves every ano|malous quality to operate in its full extent, and &s;uffers the natural character to diffu&s;e it&s;elf to every part of life. The pride which under the check of publick ob&s;ervation would have been only vented among &s;ervants and dome&s;ticks, becomes in a country baronet the torment of a province, and in&s;tead of terminating in the de&s;truction of china ware and gla&s;&s;es, ruins tenants, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es cotta|gers, and harra&s;&s;es villages with actions of tre&s;pa&s;s and bills of indictment.</P>
<P>IT frequently happens that even without violent pa&s;&s;ions or enormous corruption the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
freedom and laxity of a ru&s;tick life produces remarkable particularities of conduct or man|ner. In the province where I now re&s;ide, we have one lady eminent for wearing a gown always of the &s;ame cut and colour; another for &s;haking hands with tho&s;e that vi&s;it her; and a third for un&s;haken re&s;olution never to let tea or coffee enter her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT of all the female characters which this place affords, I have found none &s;o worthy of attention as that of Mrs. <HI>Bu&s;y,</HI> a widow, who lo&s;t her hu&s;band in her thirtieth year, and has &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed her time at the manor-hou&s;e, in the government of her children, and the management of the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>MRS. <HI>Bu&s;y</HI> was married at eighteen from a boarding-&s;chool, where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her time like other young ladies in needle-work, with a few intervals of dancing and reading. When &s;he became a bride &s;he &s;pent one win|ter with her hu&s;band in town, where, having no idea of any conver&s;ation beyond the for|malities of a vi&s;it, &s;he found nothing to en|gage her pa&s;&s;ions; and when &s;he had been one night at court, and two at an opera, and &s;een
<PB N="14" REF="15">
the Monument, the tombs, and the Tower, &s;he concluded that <HI>London</HI> had nothing more to &s;how, and wondered that when women had once &s;een the world, they could not be content to &s;tay at home. She therefore went willingly to the antient &s;eat, and for &s;ome years &s;tudied hou&s;ewifery under Mr. <HI>Bu&s;y</HI>'s mother, with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity, that the old lady, when &s;he died, bequeathed her a caudle-cup, a &s;oup di&s;h, two beakers, and a che&s;t of table linen &s;pun by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Bu&s;y</HI> finding the economical quali|ties of his lady, re&s;igned his affairs wholly into her hands, and devoted his life to his pointers and his hounds. He never vi&s;ited his e&s;tates, but to de&s;troy the partridges or foxes; and often committed &s;uch deva&s;tations in the rage of plea&s;ure, that &s;ome of his te|nants refu&s;ed to hold their lands at the u&s;ual rent. Their landlady per&s;uaded them to be &s;atisfied, and entreated her hu&s;band to di&s;mi&s;s his dogs, with many exact calcula|tions of the ale drank by his companions, and the corn con&s;umed by the hor&s;es, and remon&s;trances again&s;t the in&s;olence of the hunt&s;man, and the frauds of the groom.
<PB N="15" REF="16">
The hunt&s;man was too nece&s;&s;ary to his hap|pine&s;s to be di&s;carded; and he had &s;till con|tinued to ravage his own e&s;tate, had he not caught a cold and a fever by &s;hooting mal|lards in the fens. His fever was followed by a con&s;umption, which in a few months brought him to the grave.</P>
<P>MRS. <HI>Bu&s;y</HI> was too much an economi&s;t to feel either joy or &s;orrow at his death. She received the compliments and con&s;olations of her neighbours in a dark room, out of which &s;he &s;tole privately every night and morning to &s;ee the cows milked; and after a few days declared that &s;he thought a wi|dow might employ her&s;elf better than in nur&s;ing grief, and that, for her part, &s;he was re&s;olved that the fortunes of her children &s;hould not be impaired by her neglect.</P>
<P>SHE therefore immediately applied her&s;elf to the reformation of abu&s;es. She gave away the dogs, di&s;charged the &s;ervants of the ken|nel and &s;table, and &s;ent the hor&s;es to the next fair, but rated at &s;o high a price that they returned un&s;old. She was re&s;olved to have nothing idle about her, and ordered them to
<PB N="16" REF="17">
be employed in common drudgery. They lo&s;t their &s;leekne&s;s and grace, and were &s;oon purcha&s;ed at half the value.</P>
<P>SHE &s;oon di&s;encumbered her&s;elf from her weeds, and put on a riding-hood, a coar&s;e Apron, and &s;hort petticoats, and has turned a large manor into a farm, of which &s;he takes the management wholly upon her&s;elf. She ri&s;es before the &s;un to order the hor&s;es to their geers, and &s;ees them well rubbed down at their return from work; &s;he attends the dairy morning and evening, and watches when a calf falls that it may be carefully nur&s;ed; &s;he walks out among the &s;heep at noon, counts the lambs, and ob&s;erves the fences, and, where &s;he finds a gap, &s;tops it with a bu&s;h till it can be better mended. In harve&s;t &s;he rides afield in the Waggon, and is very li|beral of her ale from a wooden bottle. At her lei&s;ure hours &s;he looks goo&s;e eggs, airs the wool room, and turns the chee&s;e.</P>
<P>EITHER re&s;pect or curio&s;ity &s;till brings vi&s;itants to her hou&s;e, whom &s;he entertains with progno&s;ticks of a &s;carcity of wheat, or arot among the &s;heep, and whom &s;he always
<PB N="17" REF="18">
thinks her&s;elf privileged to di&s;mi&s;s, when &s;he is to &s;ee the hogs feed, or to count her poultry on the roo&s;t.</P>
<P>THE only things neglected about her are her children, whom &s;he has taught nothing but the lowe&s;t hou&s;hold duties. In my la&s;t vi&s;it I met mi&s;s <HI>Bu&s;y</HI> carrying grains to a &s;ick cow, and was entertained with the ac|compli&s;hments of her elder &s;on, a youth of &s;uch early maturity, that though he is only &s;ixteen, &s;he can tru&s;t him to &s;ell corn in the market. Her younger daughter who is eminent for her beauty, though &s;omewhat tanned in making hay, was bu&s;y in pouring out ale to the plowmen, that every one might have an equal &s;hare.</P>
<P>I COULD not but look with pity on this young family, doomed by the ab&s;urd prudence of their mother to ignorance and meanne&s;s; but when I recommended a more elegant education, was an&s;wered, that &s;he never &s;aw booki&s;h or finical people grow rich, and that &s;he was good for nothing her&s;elf till &s;he had forgotten the nicety of the boarding-&s;chool.</P>

<P>IT is required by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> to the perfection of a tragedy, and is equally nece&s;&s;ary to every other &s;pecies of regular compo&s;ition, that it &s;hould have a beginning, a middle, and an end. "The beginning," &s;ays he "is that which has nothing nece&s;&s;arily previous but to which that which follows is naturally con&s;equent; the end, on the contrary, is that which by nece&s;&s;ity, or, at lea&s;t, ac|cording to the common cour&s;e of things, &s;ucceeds &s;omething el&s;e, but which implies nothing con&s;equent to it&s;elf; the middle is connected on one &s;ide to &s;omething that naturally goes before, and on the other to &s;omething that naturally follows it."</P>
<P>SUCH is the rule laid down by this great critick, for the di&s;po&s;ition of the different parts of a well con&s;tituted fable. It mu&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="20">
begin, where it may be made intelligible with|out introduction; and end, where the mind is left in repo&s;e, without expectation of any farther event. The intermediate pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t join the la&s;t effect to the fir&s;t cau&s;e, by a regular and and unbroken concatenation; no|thing mu&s;t be therefore in&s;erted which does not apparently ari&s;e from &s;omething fore|going, and properly make way for &s;omething that &s;ucceeds it.</P>
<P>THIS Precept is to be under&s;tood in its rigour, only with re&s;pect to great and e&s;&s;ential events, and cannot be extended in the &s;ame force to minuter circum&s;tances and une&s;&s;ential decorations, which yet are more happy as they contribute more to the main de&s;ign; for it is always a proof of exten&s;ive thought and accu|rate circum&s;pection, to promote various pur|po&s;es by the &s;ame act; and the idea of an ornament admits u&s;e, though it &s;eems to ex|clude nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>WHOEVER purpo&s;es, as it is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Milton, to build the lo&s;ty rhyme,</HI> mu&s;t acquaint him&s;elf with this law of poetieal architecture, and take care that his edi&s;ice be &s;olid as well
<PB N="20" REF="21">
as beautiful; that nothing &s;tand &s;ingle or inde|pendent &s;o as that it may be taken away with|out injuring the re&s;t; but that from the founda|tion to the pinnacles one part re&s;t firm upon another.</P>
<P>THIS regular and con&s;equential di&s;tribu|tion, is among common authors frequently neglected; but the failures of tho&s;e, who&s;e ex|ample can have no influence, may be &s;afely overlooked, nor is it of much u&s;e to recall ob&s;cure and unregarded names to memory for the &s;ake of &s;porting with their Infamy. But if there is any writer who&s;e genius can em|belli&s;h impropriety, and who&s;e authority can make error venerable, his works are the pro|per objects of critical inqui&s;ition.

<P>THE tragedy of <HI>Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes</HI> has been celebrated as the &s;econd performance of the great author of <HI>Paradi&s;e lo&s;t,</HI> and oppo&s;ed with all the confidence of triumph to the dramatick

performances of other nations. It contains indeed ju&s;t &s;entiments, maxims of wi&s;dom, and oracles of piety, and many pa&s;&s;ages written with the antient &s;pirit of choral poetry, in which there is a ju&s;t and plea&s;ing mixture of <HI>Seneca</HI>'s moral declamation with the wild enthu&s;ia&s;m of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers. It is there|fore worthy of examination, whether a per|formance thus illuminated with genius, and enriched with learning, is compo&s;ed according to the indi&s;pentable laws of <HI>Ari&s;totelian</HI> criti|ci&s;m; and, omitting at pre&s;ent all other con|&s;iderations, whether it contains a beginning, a middle, and an end;</P>

<P>WHILE <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> is conducted off by the me&s;&s;enger, his father returns with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in his &s;ollicitation, upon which he confers with the chorus till their dialogue is interrupted, fir&s;t by a &s;hout of triumph, and afterwards by &s;creams of horror and agony. As they &s;tand deliberating where they &s;hall be &s;ecure, a man who had been pre&s;ent at the &s;how enters, and relates how <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> having prevailed on his guide to &s;uffer him to lean again&s;t the main pillars of the thea|trical edifice, tore down the roof upon the &s;pectators and him&s;elf. <Q><L>&mdash;Tho&s;e two ma&s;&s;y pillars</L>

<P>IT is common, &s;ays <HI>Bacon,</HI> to de&s;ire the end without enduring the means. Every

member of &s;ociety feels and acknowledges the nece&s;&s;ity of detecting crimes, yet &s;carce any degree of virtue or reputation is able to &s;ecure an informer from publick hatred. The learned world has always admitted the u&s;eful|ne&s;s of critical di&s;qui&s;itions, yet he that at|tempts to &s;how, however mode&s;tly, the fai|lures of a celebrated writer, &s;hall &s;urely irri|tate his admirers, and incur the imputation of envy, captiou&s;ne&s;s, and malignity.</P>
<P>WITH this danger full in my view, I &s;hall proceed to examine the &s;entiments of <HI>Milton</HI>'s tragedy, which, though much le&s;s liable to cen&s;ure than the di&s;po&s;ition of his plan, are like tho&s;e of other writers, &s;ometimes expo|&s;ed to ju&s;t exception for want of care, or want of di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>SENTIMENTS are proper and improper as they con&s;i&s;t more or le&s;s with the character and circum&s;tances of the per&s;on to whom they are attributed, with the rules of the compo&s;ition in which they are &s;ound, or with the &s;ettled and unalterable nature of things.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">
IT is common among the tragick poets to introduce their per&s;ons alluding to events or opinions, of which they could not po&s;&s;ibly have any knowledge. The barbarians of re|mote or newly di&s;covered regions often di&s;|play their &s;kill in <HI>European</HI> learning. The god of love is mentioned in <HI>Tamerlane</HI> with all the familiarity of a <HI>Roman</HI> epigrammati&s;t; and a late writer has put <HI>Harvey</HI>'s doctrine of the circulation of the blood into the mouth of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> &s;tate&s;man, who lived near two centuries before it was known even to phi|lo&s;ophers or anatomi&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI>'s learning, which acquainted him with the manners of the antient ea&s;tern nations, and his invention, which required no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the common cant of po|etry, have pre&s;erved him from frequent out|rages of local or chronological propriety. Yet he has mentioned <HI>Chalybean Steel,</HI> of which it is not very likely that his chorus &s;hould have heard, and has made <HI>Alp</HI> the general name of a mountain, in a region where the <HI>Alps</HI> could &s;carcely be known. <Q><L><PB N="31" REF="32">
No medicinal liquor can a&s;&s;wage,</L>
<L>Nor breath of cooling air from &s;nowy <HI>Alp.</HI></L></Q> He has taught <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> the tales of <HI>Circe</HI> and the <HI>Syrcus,</HI> at which he apparently hints in his colloquy with <HI>Dalilah.</HI> <Q><L>I know thy trains,</L>
<L>Tho' dearly to my co&s;t, thy gins and toils;</L>
<L>Thy fair <HI>enchanted cup,</HI> and <HI>warbling charms</HI></L>
<L>No more on me have pow'r.</L></Q></P>
<P>BUT the gro&s;&s;e&s;t error of this kind is the &s;olemn introduction of the phoenix in the la&s;t &s;cene, which is faulty, not only as it is incongruous to the per&s;onage to whom it is a&s;|cribed, but as it is &s;o evidently contrary to rea&s;on and nature, that it ought never to be mentioned but as a fable in any &s;erious poem. <Q><L>&mdash;Virtue giv'n for lo&s;t</L>
<L>Depre&s;t, and overthrown, as &s;eem'd,</L>
<L>Like that &s;elf-begotten bird</L>
<L>In the <HI>Arabian</HI> woods embo&s;t</L>
<L>That no &s;econd knows nor third</L>

<L>A &s;ecular bird ages of lives.</L></Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;pecies of impropriety is the un&s;uitablene&s;s of thoughts to the general cha|racter of the poem. The &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity of tragedy nece&s;&s;arily rejects all pointed or epigrammatical expre&s;&s;ions, all re|mote conceits and oppo&s;ition of Ideas. <HI>Sam|&s;on</HI>'s complaint is therefore too elaborate to be natural. <Q><L>As in the land of darkne&s;s, yet in light,</L>
<L>To live a life half dead, a living death,</L>
<L>And bury'd; but O yet more mi&s;erable!</L>

<L>Bury'd yet not exempt</L>
<L>By privilege of death and burial</L>
<L>From wor&s;t of other evils, pains and wrongs.</L></Q></P>
<P>ALL allu&s;ions to low and trivial objects with which contempt is u&s;ually a&s;&s;ociated are doubtle&s;s un&s;uitable to a &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition which ought to be always awful though not always magnificent. The remark there|fore

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE politicians have long ob&s;erved that the greate&s;t events may be often traced back to trivial cau&s;es. Petty competition or ca&s;ual friend&s;hip, the prudence of a &s;lave, or the garrulity of a woman have hindered or promoted the mo&s;t important &s;chemes, and ha&s;tened or retarded the revolutions of empire.</P>
<P>WHOEVER &s;hall review his life will ge|nerally find, that the whole tenor of his con|duct has been determined by &s;ome accident of no apparent moment, or by a combina|tion of incon&s;iderable circum&s;tances, acting when his imagination was unoccupied, and his judgment un&s;ettled; and that his prin|ciples and actions have taken their colour from &s;ome &s;ecret infu&s;ion, mingled without de&s;ign in the current of his ideas. The de&s;ires
<PB N="41" REF="42">
that predominate in our hearts, are in&s;tilled by imperceptible communications at the time when we look upon the various &s;cenes of the world, and the different employments of men, with the neutrality of inexperience; and we come forth from the nur&s;ery or the &s;chool, invariably de&s;tined to the pur&s;uit of great acqui&s;itions, or petty accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>SUCH was the impul&s;e by which I have been kept in motion from my earlie&s;t years. I was born to an inheritance which gave me a claim in my childhood to di&s;tinction and care&s;&s;es, and &s;uppo&s;e therefore that I was accu&s;tomed to hear applau&s;es, before they had much influence on my thoughts. The fir&s;t prai&s;e of which I remember my|&s;elf &s;en&s;ible was that of good humour, which, whether I de&s;erved it or not when it was be&s;towed, I have &s;ince made it my whole bu&s;ine&s;s to propagate and maintain.</P>
<P>WHEN I was &s;ent to &s;chool, the gaiety of my look and the liveline&s;s of my loquacity &s;oon gained me admi&s;&s;ion to young hearts not yet fortified again&s;t affection by artifice or intere&s;t. I was entru&s;ted with every &s;tra|tagem,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
adopted into every party, and a&s;&s;o|ciated in every &s;port; my company gave ala|crity to a frolick, and gladne&s;s to a holiday. I was indeed &s;o much employed in adju&s;ting or executing &s;chemes of diver&s;ion that I had had no lei&s;ure for my ta&s;ks, but was always furni&s;hed with exerci&s;es, and in&s;tructed in my le&s;&s;ons by &s;ome kind patron of the higher cla&s;&s;es. My ma&s;ter either not &s;u&s;pecting my deficiency, or unwilling to detect what his kindne&s;s would not have &s;uffered him to pu|ni&s;h nor his impartiality to excu&s;e, com|monly allowed me to e&s;cape with a very &s;light examination, laughed at the pertne&s;s of my ignorance, and the &s;prightline&s;s of my ab&s;urdities, and could not forbear to &s;how that he regarded me with &s;uch tenderne&s;s, as genius and learning can &s;eldom excite.</P>
<P>FROM &s;chool I was at the u&s;ual age di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to the univer&s;ity, where I &s;oon drew upon me the notice of the younger &s;tudents, and was the con&s;tant partner of their mor|ning walks and evening compotations. I was not indeed much celebrated for literature, but was looked on with indulgence as a man of parts who wanted nothing but the dul|ne&s;s
<PB N="43" REF="44">
of a &s;cholar, and might become eminent, whenever he &s;hould conde&s;cend to labour and attention. My tutor a while reproached me with negligence, and attempted to repre&s;s my &s;allies with the &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s of lettered gravity; yet having natural good humour lurk|ing in his heart, he could not long hold out again&s;t the power of hilarity, but after a few months began to relax the mu&s;cles of di&s;ciplinarian moro&s;ene&s;s, received me with &s;miles after an elopement, and, that he might not betray his tru&s;t to his fondne&s;s, was content to &s;pare my diligence by encrea&s;ing his own.</P>
<P>THUS I continued to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom of collegiate au&s;terity, to wa&s;te my own life in idlene&s;s, and lure others from their &s;tudies, till the happy hour arrived, when in the re|gular progre&s;s of education, I was &s;ent to <HI>London.</HI> I &s;oon di&s;covered the town to be the proper element of youth and gaiety. I was quickly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a wit by the ladies, a &s;pecies of beings of whom I had only heard at the univer&s;ity, and whom I had no &s;ooner the happine&s;s of approaching
<PB N="44" REF="45">
than I devoted all my faculties to the am|bition of plea&s;ing them.</P>
<P>A WIT, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> in the dialect of ladies is not always a man, who by the action of a vigorous fancy upon comprehen&s;ive knowledge, brings di&s;tant ideas unexpect|edly together, who by &s;ome peculiar a|cutene&s;s di&s;covers re&s;emblances in objects di&s;&s;imilar to common eyes, or by mixing heterogeneous notions dazzles the attention with &s;udden &s;cintillations of conceit. A lady's wit is a man who can make ladies laugh, to which, however ea&s;y it may &s;eem, many gifts of nature, and attainments of art mu&s;t commonly concur. He that hopes to be received as a wit in female a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould have a form neither &s;o amiable as to &s;trike with admiration, nor &s;o coar&s;e as to rai&s;e di&s;gu&s;t, with an under&s;tanding too fee|ble to be dreaded, and too forcible to be de&s;pi&s;ed. The other parts of the character are more &s;ubject to variation; it was former|ly e&s;&s;ential to a wit, that half his back &s;hould be covered with a &s;nowy fleece, and at a time yet more remote no man was a wit without his boots; in the days of the &s;pecta|tor
<PB N="45" REF="46">
a &s;nuff-box &s;eems to have been indi&s;pen|&s;able, but in my time an embroidered coat was &s;ufficient, without any preci&s;e regulation of the re&s;t of his dre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT wigs and boots and &s;nuff-boxes are vain without a perpetual re&s;olution to be merry, and who can always find &s;upplies of mirth! <HI>Juvenal</HI> indeed, in his compari&s;on of the two oppo&s;ite philo&s;ophers, wonders only whence an unexhau&s;ted fountain of tears could be di&s;charged; but had <HI>Juvenal,</HI> with all his &s;pirit, undertaken my province, he would have found con&s;tant gaiety equally difficult to be &s;upported. Con&s;ider, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> and compa&s;&s;ionate the condition of a man who has taught every company to ex|pect from him, a continual fea&s;t of laughter, an unintermitted &s;tream of jocularity. The ta&s;k of every other &s;lave has an end. The rower in time reaches the port; the lexico|grapher at la&s;t finds the conclu&s;ion of his al|phabet; only the haple&s;s wit has his labour always to begin, the call for novelty is ne|ver &s;atisfied, and one je&s;t only rai&s;es expecta|tion of another.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
I KNOW that among men of learning and a&s;perity the retainers to the female world are not con&s;idered with much regard; yet I can|not but hope that if you knew at how dear a rate our honours are purcha&s;ed, you would look with &s;ome gratulation on our &s;ucce&s;s, and with &s;ome pity on our mi&s;carriages. Think on the mi&s;ery of him who is con|demned to cultivate barrenne&s;s, and romage vacuity; who is obliged to continue his talk when his meaning is &s;pent, to rai&s;e merriment without images, to harra&s;s his imagina|tion in que&s;t of thoughts which he cannot &s;tart, and his memory in pur&s;uit of narra|tives which he cannot overtake; ob&s;erve the effort with which he &s;trains to conceal de&s;pondency by a &s;mile, and the di&s;tre&s;s in which he &s;its while the eyes of the company are fixed upon him as their la&s;t refuge from &s;ilence and dejection.</P>
<P>IT were endle&s;s to recount the &s;hifts to which I have been reduced, or to enume|rate the different &s;pecies of artificial wit. I regularly frequented coffee-hou&s;es, and have often lived a week upon an expre&s;&s;ion, of
<PB N="47" REF="48">
which he who dropped it did not know the value. When fortune did not favour my erratic indu&s;try, I gleaned je&s;ts at home from ob&s;olete farces. To collect wit was indeed &s;afe, for I con&s;orted with none that looked much into books, but to di&s;per&s;e it was the difficulty. A &s;eeming negligence was often u&s;eful, and I have very &s;ucce&s;sfully made a reply not to what the lady had &s;aid, but to what it was convenient for me to hear; for very few were &s;o perver&s;e as to rectify a mi&s;take which had given occa&s;ion to a bur&s;t of merriment. Sometimes I drew the conver|&s;ation up by degrees to a proper point, and produced a conceit which I had trea&s;ured up, like &s;port&s;men who boa&s;t of killing the foxes which they lodge in the covert. Eminence is however in &s;ome happy moments gained at le&s;s expence; I have delighted a whole cir|cle at one time with a &s;eries of quibbles, and made my&s;elf good company at another by &s;calding my fingers, or mi&s;taking a lady's lap for my own chair.</P>
<P>THESE are artful deceits and u&s;eful ex|pedients; but expedients are at length ex|hau&s;ted, and deceits detected. Time it&s;elf,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
among other injuries, dimini&s;hes the power of plea&s;ing, and I now find in my forty fifth year many pranks and plea&s;antries very coldly received which have formerly filled a whole room with jollity and acclamation. I am un|der the melancholy nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting that character by &s;tudy, which I gained by levity, having learned too late that gaiety mu&s;t be recommended by higher qualities, and that mirth can never plea&s;e long but as the efflore&s;cence of a mind loved for its luxu|riance, but e&s;teemed for its u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been long accu&s;tomed to re|tire annually from the town in the &s;ummer months, I lately accepted the invita|tion of <HI>Eugenio,</HI> who has an e&s;tate and &s;eat in a di&s;tant county. As we were unwilling to travel without improvement, we turned often from the direct road to plea&s;e our&s;elves with the view of nature or of art; we ex|amined every wild mountain and medicinal &s;pring, critici&s;ed every edifice, contemplated every ruin that was to be found on either hand, and compared every &s;cene of action with the narratives of hi&s;torians. By this &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of amu&s;ements we enjoyed the exer|ci&s;e of a journey without &s;uffering the fatigue, and had nothing to regret but that by a pro|gre&s;s &s;o lei&s;urely and gentle, we mi&s;&s;ed the adventures of a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and the plea&s;ure
<PB N="50" REF="51">
of alarming villages with the tumult of our pa&s;&s;age, and of di&s;gui&s;ing our in&s;ignificancy by the dignity of hurry.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t week after our arrival at <HI>Eu|genio</HI>'s hou&s;e was pa&s;&s;ed in receiving vi&s;its from his neighbours, who crowded about him with all the cagerne&s;s of benevolence; &s;ome impatient to learn the news of the Court and town, that they might be qualified by authentick information to dictate to the rural politicians on the next bowling day; others de&s;irous of his intere&s;t to accom|modate di&s;putes, or of his advice in the &s;ettlement of their fortunes and the marriage of their children.</P>
<P>THE civilities which we had received were &s;oon to be returned; and I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with great &s;atisfaction in roving through the country, and viewing the &s;eats, gardens and plantations which are &s;cattered over it. My plea&s;ure would indeed have been greater had I been &s;ometimes allowed to wander in a park or wilderne&s;s alone, but to appear as the friend of <HI>Eugenio</HI> was an honour not to be enjoyed without &s;ome inconveniences; &s;o
<PB N="51" REF="52">
much was every one &s;olicitous for my regard, that I could &s;eldom e&s;cape to &s;olitude, or &s;teal a moment from the emulation of com|plai&s;ance, and the vigilance of officiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e rambles of good neighbourhood we frequently pa&s;&s;ed by a hou&s;e of unu&s;ual magnificence, which, while I had my cu|rio&s;ity yet di&s;tracted among many novelties, did not much attract my ob&s;ervation; but in a &s;hort time I could not forbear &s;urveying it with particular notice; for the length of the wall which enclo&s;ed the gardens, the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the &s;hades that waved over it, and the canals, of which I could obtain &s;ome glimp&s;es through the trees from our own windows, gave me rea&s;on to expect more grandeur and beauty than I had yet &s;een in that province. I therefore enquired as we rode by it, why we never among&s;t our excur&s;ions &s;pent an hour where there was &s;uch appearance of &s;plendor and affluence. <HI>Eugenio</HI> told me that the &s;eat which I &s;o much admired, was commonly called in the coun|try the <HI>haunted hou&s;e,</HI> and that no vi&s;its were paid there by any of the gentlemen whom I had yet &s;een. As the haunts of incorporeal
<PB N="52" REF="53">
beings are generally ruinous, neglected and de&s;olate, I ea&s;ily conceived that there was &s;omething to be explained, and told him that I &s;uppo&s;ed it only fairy ground, on which we might venture by day-light with|out danger. The danger, &s;ays he, is indeed only that of appearing to &s;olicit the acquain|tance of a man, with whom it is not po&s;&s;i|ble to conver&s;e without infamy, and who has driven from him by his in&s;olence or ma|lignity every human being who can live with|out him.</P>
<P>OUR conver&s;ation was then accidentally in|terrupted; but my inqui&s;itive humour being now in motion, could not re&s;t without a full account of this newly di&s;covered prodigy. I was &s;oon informed that the fine hou&s;e and &s;pacious gardens were haunted by &s;quire <HI>Blu&s;ter,</HI> of whom it was very ea&s;y to learn the character, &s;ince nobody had regard for him &s;ufficient to hinder them from telling whatever they could di&s;cover.</P>
<P>SQUIRE <HI>Blu&s;ter</HI> is de&s;cended of an antient family. The e&s;tate which his ance&s;tors had immemorially po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was much augmented
<PB N="53" REF="54">
by captain <HI>Blu&s;ter,</HI> who &s;erved under <HI>Drake</HI> in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; and the <HI>Blu&s;ters</HI> who were before only petty gentlemen, have from that time frequently repre&s;ented the &s;hire in parliament, been cho&s;en to pre&s;ent ad|dre&s;&s;es, and given laws at hunting-matches and races. They were eminently ho&s;pitable and popular, till the father of this gentle|man died of a fever, which he caught in the crowd of an election. His lady went to the grave &s;oon after him, and left the heir then only ten years old to the care of his grand|mother, who would not &s;uffer him to be con|trolled, becau&s;e &s;he could not bear to hear him cry; and never &s;ent him to &s;chool, be|cau&s;e &s;he was not able to live without his company. She taught him however very early to in&s;pect the &s;teward's accounts, to dog the butler from the cellar, and to catch the &s;ervants at a junket; &s;o that he was at the age of eighteen a complete ma&s;ter of all the lower arts of dome&s;tick policy, had often on the road detected combinations between the coachman and the o&s;tler, and procured the di&s;charge of nineteen maids for illicit cor|re&s;pondence with cottagers and charwomen.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
BY the opportunities of par&s;imony which minority affords, and which the probity of his guardians had diligently improved, a very large &s;um of money was accumulated, and he found him&s;elf when he took his affairs into his own hands the riche&s;t man in the county. It has been long the cu&s;tom of this family to celebrate the heir's completion of his twenty-fir&s;t year, by an entertainment, at which the hou&s;e is thrown open to all that are inclined to enter it, and the whole pro|vince flocks together as to a general fe&s;tivity. On this occa&s;ion young <HI>Blu&s;ter</HI> exhibited the fir&s;t tokens of his future eminence, by &s;hak|ing his pur&s;e at an old gentleman, who had been the mo&s;t intimate friend of his father, and offering to wager a greater &s;um than he could afford to venture; a practice with which he has at one time or other in&s;ulted every freeholder within ten miles round him.</P>
<P>HIS next acts of offence were committed in a contentious and &s;piteful vindication of the privileges of his manors, and a rigorous and relentle&s;s pro&s;ecution of every man that pre&s;umed to violate his game. As he hap|pens
<PB N="55" REF="56">
to have no e&s;tate adjoining equal to his own, his oppre&s;&s;ions are often born without re&s;i&s;tance for fear of a long &s;uit, of which he delights to count the expences without the lea&s;t &s;olicitude about the event, for he knows that where nothing but an honorary right is conte&s;ted, the poorer antagoni&s;t mu&s;t always &s;uffer whatever &s;hall be the la&s;t deci|&s;ion of the law.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;putes, he has &s;o elated his in&s;olence, and by reflecti|on upon the general hatred which they have brought upon him, &s;o irritated his virulence, that his whole life is &s;pent in meditating or executing mi&s;chief. It is his common prac|tice to procure his hedges to be broken in the night, and then to demand &s;atisfaction for damages which his grounds have &s;uffered from his neighbour's cattle. An old widow was ye&s;terday &s;oliciting <HI>Eugenio</HI> to enable her to replevin her only cow then in the pound by &s;quire <HI>Blu&s;ter</HI>'s order, who had &s;ent one of his agents to take advantage of her cala|mity, and per&s;uade her to &s;ell the cow at an under rate. He has driven a day labourer from his cottage, for gathering blackberries in a hedge for his children; and has now an
<PB N="56" REF="57">
old woman in the county jail for a tre&s;pa&s;s which &s;he committed, by coming into his grounds to pick up acorns for her hog.</P>
<P>MONEY, in whatever hands, will confer power. Di&s;tre&s;s will fly to immediate re|fuge without much con&s;ideration of remote con&s;equences. <HI>Blu&s;ter</HI> has therefore a de&s;|potick authority in many families whom he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted on pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions with larger &s;ums than they can ea&s;ily repay. The only vi&s;its that he makes are to the&s;e hou&s;es of misfortune, where he enters with the in&s;o|lence of ab&s;olute command, enjoys the ter|rors of the family, exacts their obedience, riots at their charge, and in the height of his joy in&s;ults the father with menaces, and the daughters with ob&s;cenity.</P>
<P>HE is of late &s;omewhat le&s;s offen&s;ive; for one of his debtors after gentle expo&s;tulations by which he was only irritated to gro&s;&s;er outrage, &s;eized him by the &s;leeve, led him trembling into the court-yard, and clo&s;ed the door upon him in a &s;tormy night. He took his u&s;ual revenge next morning by a writ, but the debt was di&s;charged by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Eugenio.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
IT is his rule to &s;uffer his tenants to owe him rent, becau&s;e by this indulgence, he &s;e|cures to him&s;elf the power of &s;eizure when|ever he has an inclination to amu&s;e him&s;elf with calamity, and fea&s;t his ears with en|treaties and lamentations. Yet as he is &s;ome|times capriciou&s;ly liberal to tho&s;e whom he happens to adopt as favourites, and lets his lands at a cheap rate, his farms are never long unoccupied; and when one is ruined by op|pre&s;&s;ion, the po&s;&s;ibility of better fortune quickly lures another to &s;upply his place.</P>
<P>SUCH is the life of &s;quire <HI>Blu&s;ter</HI>; a man in who&s;e power fortune has liberally placed the means of happine&s;s, but who has de&s;eat|ed all her gifts of their end by the depravity of his mind. He is wealthy without fol|lowers; he is magnificent without witne&s;&s;es; he has birth without alliance, and influence without dignity. His neighbours &s;corn him as a brute; his dependents dread him as an oppre&s;&s;or, and he has only the gloomy com|&s;ort of reflecting, that if he is hated, he is likewi&s;e feared.</P>

<P>AMONG the innumerable practices by which intere&s;t or envy have taught tho&s;e who live upon literary fame to di&s;turb each other at their airy banquets, one of the mo&s;t common is the charge of plagiari&s;m, When the excellence of a new compo&s;ition, can no longer be conte&s;ted, and malice is compelled to give way to the unanimity of applau&s;e, there is yet this one expedient to be tried by which the author may be degraded, though his work be reverenced; and the ex|cellence which we cannot ob&s;cure, may be &s;et at &s;uch a di&s;tance as not to overpower our fainter lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THIS accu&s;ation is dangerous, becau&s;e, even when it is fal&s;e, it may be &s;ometimes urged with probability. <HI>Bruyere</HI> declares that we are come into the world too late to pro|duce any thing new, that nature and life are
<PB N="59" REF="60">
preoccupied, and that de&s;cription and &s;enti|ment have been long exhau&s;ted. It is indeed certain that whoever attempts any com|mon topick, will find many unexpected co|incidences of his thoughts with tho&s;e of other writers; nor can the nice&s;t judgment always di&s;tingui&s;h accidental &s;imilitude from artful imitation. There is likewi&s;e a common &s;tock of images, a &s;ettled mode of arrange|ment, and a beaten track of tran&s;ition, which all authors &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves at liberty to u&s;e, and which produce the re&s;emblance ge|nerally ob&s;ervable among contemporaries. So that in books which be&s;t de&s;erve the name of originals, there is little new beyond the di&s;po&s;ition of materials already provided; the &s;ame ideas and combinations of ideas have been long in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of other hands; and by re&s;toring to every man his own, as the <HI>Romans</HI> mu&s;t have returned to their cots from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the world, &s;o the mo&s;t inventive and fertile genius would reduce his folios to a few pages. Yet the author who imitates his predece&s;&s;ors only, by furni&s;hing him&s;elf with thoughts and ele|gancies out of the &s;ame general magazine of literature, can with little more propriety be re|proached
<PB N="60" REF="61">
as a plagiary, than the architect can be cen&s;ured as a mean copier of <HI>Angelo</HI> or <HI>Wren,</HI> becau&s;e he digs his marble from the &s;ame quarry, &s;quares his &s;tones by the &s;ame art, and unites them in columns of the &s;ame orders.</P>
<P>MANY &s;ubjects fall under the con&s;ideration of an author, which being limited by nature can admit only of &s;light and accidental di|ver&s;ities.

Different poets de|&s;cribing the &s;pring or the &s;ea would mention the zephyrs and the flowers, the billows and the rocks; reflecting on human life, they would, without any communication of opinions, lament the deceitfulne&s;s of hope, the fugacity of plea&s;ure, the fragility of beau|ty, and the frequency of calamity; and, for palliatives of the&s;e incurable mi&s;eries, they would concur in recommending kindne&s;s, temperance, caution and fortitude.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to mingle in any conver|&s;ation without ob&s;erving the difficulty with which a new name makes its way into the world. The fir&s;t appearance of excellence unites multitudes again&s;t it; unexpected op|po&s;ition ri&s;es up on every &s;ide; the celebra|ted and the ob&s;cure join in the confederacy; &s;ubtilty furni&s;hes arms to impudence, and in|vention leads on credulity.</P>
<P>THE &s;trength and unanimity of this alli|ance is not ea&s;ily conceived. It might be ex|pected that no man &s;hould &s;uffer his heart to be enflamed with malice, but by injuries; that none &s;hould bu&s;y him&s;elf in conte&s;ting the preten&s;ions of another, but where &s;ome right of his own was involved in the que&s;|tion;
<PB N="69" REF="70">
that at lea&s;t ho&s;tilities commenced without cau&s;e, &s;hould quickly cea&s;e; that the armies of malignity &s;hould &s;oon di&s;per&s;e, when no common intere&s;t could be found to hold them together; and that the attack upon a ri|&s;ing character &s;hould be left entirely to tho&s;e who had &s;omething to hope or fear from the event.</P>
<P>THE hazards of tho&s;e that a&s;pire to emi|nence would be much dimini&s;hed if they had none but acknowledged rivals to encounter. Their enemies would then be few, and, what is of yet greater importance, would be known. But what caution is &s;ufficient to ward off the blows of invi&s;ible a&s;&s;ailants, or what force can &s;tand again&s;t unintermitted attacks, and a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enemies? Yet &s;uch is the &s;tate of the world, that no &s;ooner can any man emerge from the crowd, and fix the eyes of the publick upon him, than he &s;tands as a mark to the arrows of lurking ca|lumny, and receives, in the tumult of ho&s;ti|lity, from di&s;tant and from namele&s;s hands, wounds not always ea&s;y to be cured.</P>
<P>IT is probable that the on&s;et again&s;t the candidates for renown, is originally incited
<PB N="70" REF="71">
by tho&s;e who imagine them&s;elves in danger of &s;uffering by their &s;ucce&s;s; but when war is once declared, volunteers flock to the &s;tan|dard, multitudes follow the camp only for want of employment, and flying &s;quadrons are di&s;per&s;ed to every part, &s;o plea&s;ed with an opportunity of mi&s;chief that they toil without pro&s;pect of prai&s;e, and pillage without hope of profit.</P>
<P>WHEN any man has endeavoured to de|&s;erve di&s;tinction, he may be ea&s;ily convinced how long his claim is likely to remain unacknowledged, by wandering for a few days from one place of re&s;ort to another. He will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him&s;elf cen&s;ured where he could not expect to have been na|med; he will find the utmo&s;t acrimony of malice among tho&s;e whom he never could have offended, and perhaps may be invited to an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t him&s;elf, or appealed to as a witne&s;s of his own infamy.</P>
<P>AS there are to be found in the &s;ervice of envy men of every diver&s;ity of temper and degree of under&s;tanding, calumny is diffu&s;ed by all arts and methods of propagation.
<PB N="71" REF="72">
Nothing is too gro&s;s or too refined, too cruel or too trifling to be practi&s;ed; very little re|gard is had to the rules of honourable ho&s;ti|lity, but every weapon is accounted lawful; and tho&s;e that cannot make a thru&s;t at life are content to keep them&s;elves in play with petty malevolence, to teaze with feeble blows and impotent di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>BUT as the indu&s;try of ob&s;ervation has divided the mo&s;t mi&s;cellaneous and confu&s;ed a&s;&s;emblages into proper cla&s;&s;es, and ranged the in&s;ects of the &s;ummer, that torment us with their drones or &s;tings, by their &s;everal tribes; the per&s;ecutors of merit, notwith&s;tand|ing their number, may be likewi&s;e commodi|ou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed into roarers, whi&s;perers, and moderators.</P>
<P>THE roarer is an enemy rather terrible than dangerous. He has no other qualifica|tions for a champion of controver&s;y than a hardened front and &s;trong voice. Having &s;el|dom &s;o much de&s;ire to confute as to &s;ilence, he depends rather upon voci&s;eration than ar|gument, and has very little care to adju&s;t one part of his accu&s;ation to another, to pre&s;erve
<PB N="72" REF="73">
decency in his language or probability in his narratives. He has always a &s;tore of reproach|ful epithets and contemptuous appellations, ready to be produced as occa&s;ion may re|quire, which by con&s;tant u&s;e he pours out with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s volubility. If the wealth of a trader is mentioned, he without he&s;itation devotes him to bankrupcy; if the beauty and elegance of a lady be commended, he won|ders how the town can fall in love with ru&s;|tick deformity; if a new performance of ge|nius happens to be celebrated, he pronounces the writer a hopele&s;s ideot, without know|ledge of books or life, and without the un|der&s;tanding by which it mu&s;t be acquired. His exaggerations are generally without effect upon tho&s;e whom he compels to hear them; and though it will &s;ometimes happen that the timorous are awed by his violence, and the credulous mi&s;take his confidence for know|ledge, yet the opinions which he endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s &s;oon recover their former &s;trength, as the trees that bend to the tempe&s;t erect them&s;elves again when its force is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE whi&s;perer is more dangerous. He ea|&s;ily gains attention by a &s;oft addre&s;s, and ex|cites
<PB N="73" REF="74">
curio&s;ity by an air of importance. As &s;ecrets are not to be made cheap by promi&s;|cuous publication, he calls a &s;elect audience about him, and gratifies their vanity with an appearance of tru&s;t by communicating his in|telligence in a low voice. Of the trader he can tell that though he &s;eems to manage a very exten&s;ive commerce, talks in high terms of the funds, and has a counting-hou&s;e crowd|ed with clerks and porters, yet his wealth is not equal to his reputation; he has lately &s;uf|fered much by the mi&s;carriage of an expen|&s;ive project, and had a greater &s;hare than is publickly acknowledged in the rich &s;hip that peri&s;hed by the &s;torm. Of the beauty he has little to &s;ay, but that they who &s;ee her in a morning do not di&s;cover all the&s;e graces which are admired in the park. Of the writer he affirms with great certainty, that, though the excellence of the work be inconte&s;table, he can ju&s;tly claim but a &s;mall part of the repu|tation; that he owed mo&s;t of the &s;hining ima|ges and elevated &s;entiments to the kindne&s;s of a &s;ecret friend; and that the accuracy and e|quality of the &s;tile was produced by the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive correction of the chief criticks of the age.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="75">
As every one is plea&s;ed with imagining that he knows &s;omething not yet commonly divulged, &s;ecret hi&s;tory ea&s;ily gains credit; but it is for the mo&s;t part believed only while it circulates in whi&s;pers, and when once it is openly told is openly confuted.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t pernicious enemy is the man of moderation. Without intere&s;t in the que&s;tion, or any motive but hone&s;t curio&s;ity, this impartial and zealous enquirer after truth, is ready to hear whatever can be urged on either &s;ide, and always di&s;po&s;ed to kind in|terpretations and favourable opinions. He has heard the trader's affairs reported with great variation, and after a diligent compari&s;on of the evidence, concludes it probable that the &s;plendid &s;uper&s;tructure of bu&s;ine&s;s and credit being originally built upon a narrow ba&s;is, has lately been found to totter; but between di|latory payment and bankrupcy there is a great di&s;tance; many merchants have &s;upported them&s;elves by expedients for a time, without any final injury to their creditors; what is lo&s;t by one adventure may be recovered by another; and no man, however prudent, can
<PB N="75" REF="76">
&s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the failure of corre&s;|pondents. He believes that a young lady plea&s;ed with admiration, and de&s;irous to make perfect what is already excellent, may heigh|ten &s;ome of her charms by artificial improve|ments, but &s;urely mo&s;t of her beauties mu&s;t be genuine, and who can &s;ay that he is whol|ly what he endeavours to appear? The author he knows to be a man of diligence, who per|haps does not &s;parkle with the fire of <HI>Homer,</HI> but has the judgment to di&s;cover his own de|ficiencies, and to &s;upply them by the help of others; and in his opinion mode&s;ty is a qua|lity &s;o amiable and rare, that it ought to find a patron wherever it appears, and may ju&s;tly be preferred by the publick &s;uffrage to petulant wit and o&s;tentatious literature.</P>
<P>HE who thus di&s;covers failings with un|willingne&s;s, and extenuates the Faults which cannot be denied, puts an end at once to doubt or vindication; his hearers repo&s;e upon his candour and veracity, and admit the charge without allowing the excu&s;e.</P>
<P>SUCH are the arts by which the envious, the idle, the peevi&s;h, and the thoughtle&s;s ob|&s;truct
<PB N="76" REF="77">
that worth which they cannot equal, and by artifices thus ea&s;y, &s;ordid, and de|te&s;table is indu&s;try defeated, beauty bla&s;ted, and genius depre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>THIS is one of the innumerable theories which the fir&s;t attempt to reduce them into practice certainly de&s;troys.

<P>IT will be found upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection, that this part of the conduct of mankind is by no means contrary to rea&s;on or equity.

<P>NONE of the projects or de&s;igns which exerci&s;e the mind of man, are equally &s;ubject to ob&s;tructions and di&s;appointments with the pur&s;uit of fame.

But prai&s;e may be always omitted without inconvenience. When once a man has made celebrity nece&s;&s;ary to his

trivial objections and injudicious commen|dations, he enters the places of mingled con|ver&s;ation, &s;its down to his tea in an ob&s;cure corner, and while he appears to examine a file of antiquated journals catches the con|ver&s;ation of the whole room. He li&s;tens, but hears no mention of his book, and there|fore &s;uppo&s;es that he has di&s;appointed his cu|rio&s;ity by delay, and that as men of learning would naturally begin their conver&s;ation with &s;uch a wonderful novelty, they had digre&s;&s;ed to other &s;ubjects before his arrival.

<P>HE re&s;olves at la&s;t to violate his own mo|de&s;ty, and to recal the talkers from their folly by an enquiry after him&s;elf. He finds every one provided with an an&s;wer; one has &s;een the work adverti&s;ed, but never met with any that had read it; another has been &s;o often impo&s;ed upon by &s;pecious titles, that he never buys a book till its character is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; a third wonders what any man can hope to produce after &s;o many writers of greater eminence; the next has enquired after the author, but can hear no account of him, and therefore &s;u&s;pects the name to be ficti|tious; and another knows him to be a man condemned by indigence to write too fre|quently what he does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="89">
MANY are the con&s;olations with which the unhappy author endeavours to allay his vexation, and fortify his patience.

He finds that his ene|mies, &s;uch as apparent &s;uperiority will al|ways rai&s;e, have been indu&s;trious, while his performance was in the pre&s;s, to vilify and bla&s;t it; and that the book&s;eller, whom he had re&s;olved to enrich, has rivals in his profe&s;&s;ion, that maliciou&s;ly ob&s;truct the cir|culation of his copies.

BY &s;uch arts of voluntary delu&s;ion does every man endeavour to conceal his own unimportance from him&s;elf.

Not only the writer of books, but the commander of armies, and the deliverer of nations will ea&s;ily outlive all noi&s;y and popular reputation: he may be celebra|ted for a time by the public voice, but his actions and his name will &s;oon be con&s;idered as remote and unaffecting, and will be rarely mentioned but by tho&s;e who&s;e alliance or dependance gives them &s;ome vanity to gra|tify by frequent commemoration.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems not to be &s;ufficiently con&s;idered how little renown can be admitted in the

world. Mankind are kept perpetually bu&s;y by their fears or de&s;ires, and have not more lei&s;ure from their own affairs, than to ac|quaint them&s;elves with the accidents of the current day. Engaged in contriving &s;ome re|fuge from calamity, or in &s;hortening the way to &s;ome new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they &s;eldom &s;uffer their thoughts to wander to the pa&s;t or fu|ture; none but a few &s;olitary &s;tudents have lei&s;ure to enquire into the claims of heroes or &s;ages; removed from the notice of the pre&s;ent age, and names which hoped to range over kingdoms and continents &s;hrink at la&s;t into cloy&s;ters or colleges.</P>
<P>NOR is it certain, that even of the&s;e dark and narrow habitations, the&s;e la&s;t retreats of fame, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion will be long kept. Of men devoted to literature very few extend their views beyond &s;ome particular &s;cience, and the greater part &s;eldom enquire, even in their own profe&s;&s;ion, for any authors but tho&s;e whom the pre&s;ent mode of &s;tudy happens to force upon their notice; they de&s;ire not to fill their minds with unfa&s;hionable know|ledge, but embrace the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, and contentedly re&s;ign to oblivion tho&s;e
<PB N="91" REF="92">
books which they now find cen&s;ured or neglected.</P>
<P>THE hope of fame, which almo&s;t every man indulges who gives his name to the public, is nece&s;&s;arily connected with &s;uch con&s;iderations as mu&s;t abate the ardour of confidence, and repre&s;s the vigour of pur&s;uit. Whoever claims renown from any kind of excellence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to fill the place which is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by another, for there are already names of every cla&s;s &s;ufficient to em|ploy all that will de&s;ire to remember them; and &s;urely he that is pu&s;hing his predece&s;&s;ors into the gulph of ob&s;curity, cannot but &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pect, that he mu&s;t him&s;elf give way in like manner, and as he &s;tands upon the &s;ame precipice, be &s;wept away with the &s;ame violence.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, that fame begins when life is at an end; but far the greater number of candidates for applau&s;e have owed their reception in the world to &s;ome favour|able ca&s;ualties, and have therefore immedi|ately &s;unk into neglect, when death &s;tripped them of their ca&s;ual influence, and neither

<P>AS little things grow great by continual accumulation, I hope you will not think the dignity of your character impaired by an account of a ludicrous per&s;ecution, which though it produces no &s;cenes of hor|ror or of ruin, yet by ince&s;&s;ant importunity of
<PB N="93" REF="94">
vexation, wears away the happine&s;s of many of your readers, and con&s;umes tho&s;e juvenile years which nature &s;eems particularly to have a&s;&s;igned to chearfulne&s;s, in &s;ilent anxiety and helple&s;s re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I AM the elde&s;t &s;on of a gentleman, who having inherited a large e&s;tate from his ance&s;tors, and feeling no very &s;trong de&s;ire either to encrea&s;e or le&s;&s;en it, has from the time of his marriage generally re&s;ided at his own &s;eat, where by dividing his time among the duties of a father, a ma&s;ter, and a magi&s;trate, the &s;tudy of literature, and the offices of civility, he finds means to rid him|&s;elf of the day, without any of tho&s;e amu&s;e|ments, which all tho&s;e with whom my re&s;i|dence in this place has made me acquainted think nece&s;&s;ary to lighten the burthen of exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>WHEN my age made me capable of in&s;truc|tion, my father prevailed upon a gentleman, long known at <HI>Oxford</HI> for the extent of his learning and purity of his manners, to under|take my education. The regard with which I &s;aw him treated, di&s;po&s;ed me to con&s;ider his in&s;tructions as too important to be neglected,
<PB N="94" REF="95">
and I therefore &s;oon formed a habit of atten|tion, by which I made very quick advances in different kinds of learning, and heard, per|haps too often, very flattering compari&s;ons of my own proficiency with that of others either le&s;s docile by nature, or le&s;s happily forwarded by in&s;truction. I was care&s;&s;ed and applauded by all that exchanged vi&s;its with my father, and as young men are with little difficulty taught to judge favourably of them&s;elves, began to think that clo&s;e ap|plication was no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and that the time was now come when I was at liberty to read only for amu&s;ement, and was to receive the reward of my fatigues in prai&s;e and admiration.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus banquetting upon my own perfections, and longing in &s;ecret for an opportunity to e&s;cape from the &s;uperinten|dance of my tutor, my father's brother came from <HI>London</HI> to pa&s;s a &s;ummer at his native place. A lucrative employment which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and a fondne&s;s for the conver&s;ation and diver&s;ions of the gay part of mankind, had &s;o long kept him from rural excur&s;ions, that I had never &s;een him &s;ince my infancy. My
<PB N="95" REF="96">
curio&s;ity was therefore &s;trongly excited by the hope of ob&s;erving a character more near|ly, which I had hitherto reverenced only at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>FROM all private and intimate conver&s;a|tion I was long witheld by the perpetual con|fluence of vi&s;itants, with whom the fir&s;t news of my uncle's arrival crouded the hou&s;e; but was amply recompen&s;ed by &s;eeing an exact and punctilious practice of the arts of a cour|tier, in all the &s;tratagems of endearment, the gradations of re&s;pect, and variations of cour|te&s;y. I remarked with what ju&s;tice of di&s;|tribution he divided his talk to a wide circle; with what addre&s;s he offered every man an occa&s;ion of indulging &s;ome favourite topick, or di&s;playing &s;ome particular attainment; the judgment with which he regulated his enqui|ries after the ab&s;ent; and the care with which he &s;hewed all the companions of his early years how &s;trongly they were infixed in his memory, by the mention of pa&s;t incidents, and the recital of puerile kindne&s;&s;es dangers and frolicks. I &s;oon di&s;covered that he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;cience of graciou&s;ne&s;s and attrac|tion which books had not taught, and of
<PB N="96" REF="97">
which neither I nor my father had any know|ledge; that he had the power of obliging tho&s;e whom he did not benefit; that he dif|fu&s;ed upon his cur&s;ory behaviour and mo&s;t trifling actions a glo&s;s of &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy by which every one was dazzled; and that by &s;ome occult method of captivation, he animated the timorous, &s;oftened the &s;uperci|lious, and opened the re&s;erved. I could not but repine at the inelegance of my own man|ners which left me no hopes but not to of|fend, and at the inefficacy of ru&s;tick benevo|lence which gained no friends but by real &s;ervice.</P>
<P>MY uncle &s;aw the veneration with which I caught every accent of his voice, and watched every motion of his hand; and the aukward diligence with which I endeavoured to imitate his embrace of fondne&s;s, and his bow of re&s;pect. He was like others ea&s;ily flattered by an imitator by whom he could not fear ever to be rivalled, and repaid my a&s;&s;idu|ities with compliments and profe&s;&s;ions. Our fondne&s;s was &s;o encrea&s;ed by a mutual endea|vour to plea&s;e each other, that when he re|turned to <HI>London,</HI> he declared him&s;elf unable
<PB N="97" REF="98">
to leave a nephew &s;o amiable and &s;o accom|pli&s;hed behind him; and obtained my fa|ther's permi&s;&s;ion to enjoy my company for a few months, by a promi&s;e to initiate me in the arts of politene&s;s, and introduce me into publick life.</P>
<P>THE courtier had little inclination to fatigue, and therefore by travelling very &s;lowly, afforded me time for more loo&s;e and familiar conver&s;ation; but I &s;oon found that by a few enquiries which he was not well prepared to &s;atisfy I had made him wea|ry of his young companion. His element was a mixed a&s;&s;embly, where ceremony and healths, compliments and common topicks kept the tongue employed with very little a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from memory or reflection; but in the chariot, where he was nece&s;&s;itated to &s;up|port a regular tenor of conver&s;ation, without any relief from a new commer, or any power of &s;tarting into gay digre&s;&s;ions or de&s;troying argument by a je&s;t, he &s;oon di&s;covered that poverty of ideas which had been hitherto con|cealed under the tin&s;el of politene&s;s. The fir&s;t day he entertained me with the novelties and wonders with which I &s;hould be a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="98" REF="99">
at my entrance into <HI>London,</HI> and cau|tioned me with apparent admiration of his own wi&s;dom again&s;t the arts by which ru&s;ti|city is frequently deluded. The &s;ame de|tail and the &s;ame advice he would have re|peated on the &s;econd day; but as I every mo|ment diverted the di&s;cour&s;e to the hi&s;tory of the towns by which we pa&s;&s;ed, or &s;ome other &s;ubject of learning or of rea&s;on, he &s;oon lo&s;t his vivacity, grew peevi&s;h and &s;ilent, wrapped his cloak about him, compo&s;ed him|&s;elf to &s;lumber, and re&s;erved his gaiety for fitter auditors.</P>
<P>AT length I entered <HI>London,</HI> and my un|cle was rein&s;tated in his &s;uperiority. He awaked at once to loquacity as &s;oon as our wheels rattled on the pavement, and told me the name of every &s;treet as we cro&s;&s;ed it, and owner of every hou&s;e as we pa&s;&s;ed by. He pre&s;ented me to my aunt, a lady of great eminence for the number of her acquain|tances, and &s;plendor of her a&s;&s;emblies, and either in kindne&s;s or revenge con&s;ulted with her in my pre&s;ence, how I might be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed for my fir&s;t appear|ance, and mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly di&s;encumbered
<PB N="99" REF="100">
from my villatick ba&s;hfulne&s;s. My indigna|tion at familiarity thus contemptuous flu&s;hed in my face; they mi&s;took anger for &s;hame, and alternately exerted their eloquence upon the benefits of publick education, and the happine&s;s of an a&s;&s;urance early acquired.</P>
<P>ASSURANCE is indeed the only qualifica|tion to which they &s;eem to have annexed merit, and a&s;&s;urance therefore is perpetually recommended to me as the &s;upply of every defect, and the ornament of every excellence. I never fit &s;ilent in company when &s;ecret hi&s;tory is circulating, but I am reproached for want of a&s;&s;urance.

<P>POLITICIANS remark that no oppre&s;|&s;ion is &s;o heavy or la&s;ting as that which is inflicted by the perver&s;ion and exorbitance of legal authority. The robber may be &s;ei|zed,
<PB N="101" REF="102">
and the invader repelled whenever they are found; they who pretend no right but that of force, may by force be puni&s;hed or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But when plunder bears the name of impo&s;t, and murder is perpetrated by a judicial &s;entence, fortitude is intimida|ted and wi&s;dom confounded; re&s;i&s;tance &s;hrinks from an alliance with rebellion, and the vil|lain remains &s;ecure in the robes of the ma|gi&s;trate.</P>
<P>EQUALLY dangerous and equally dete&s;ta|ble are the cruelties often exerci&s;ed in private families, under the venerable &s;anction of pa|rental authority; the power which we are taught to honour from the fir&s;t moments of rea&s;on; which is guarded from in&s;ult and vio|lation by all that can impre&s;s awe upon the mind of man; and which therefore may wan|ton in cruelty without controul, and tram|ple the bounds of right with innumerable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, before duty and piety will dare to &s;eek redre&s;s, or think them&s;elves at liberty to recur to any other means of deliverance than &s;upplications by which in&s;olence is ela|ted, and tears by which cruelty is gratified.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">
IT was for a long time imagined by the <HI>Romans,</HI> that no &s;on could be the murderer of his father, and they had therefore no pu|ni&s;hment appropriated to parricide. They &s;eem likewi&s;e to have believed with equal confidence that no father could be cruel to his child, and therefore they allowed every man the &s;upreme judicature in his own hou&s;e, and put the lives of his offspring into his hands. But experience informed them by de|grees, that they had determined too ha&s;tily in favour of human nature; they found that in&s;tinct and habit were not able to contend with avarice or malice; that the neare&s;t rela|tion might be violated; and that power to whom&s;oever entru&s;ted, might be ill employ|ed. They were therefore obliged to &s;upply and to change their In&s;titutions; to deter the parricide by a new law, and to transfer capi|tal puni&s;hments from the parent to the ma|gi&s;trate.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed many hou&s;es which it is impo&s;&s;ible to enter familiarly, without di&s;|covering that parents are by no means ex|empt from the intoxications of dominion;
<PB N="103" REF="104">
and that he who is in no danger of hearing remon&s;trances but from his own con&s;cience, will &s;eldom be long without the art of con|trolling his convictions, and modifying ju&s;tice by his own will.</P>
<P>IF in any &s;ituation the heart were inac|ce&s;&s;ible to malignity, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured by parental relation. To have voluntarily become to any being the occa&s;ion of its exi&s;tence produces an obliga|tion to make that exi&s;tence happy. To &s;ee helple&s;s infancy &s;tretching out her hands and pouring out her cries in te&s;timony of depen|dance, without any powers to alarm jealou&s;y, or any guilt to alienate affection, mu&s;t &s;urely awaken tenderne&s;s in every human mind; and tenderne&s;s once excited will be hourly encrea&s;ed by the natural contagion of feli|city, by the repercu&s;&s;ion of communicated plea&s;ure, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the dignity of benefaction. I believe no generous or be|nevolent man can &s;ee the vile&s;t animal cour|ting his regard and &s;hrinking at his anger, playing his gambols of delight before him, calling on him in di&s;tre&s;s, and flying to him in danger, without more kindne&s;s
<PB N="104" REF="105">
than he can per&s;uade him&s;elf to feel for the wild and un&s;ocial inhabitants of the air and water. We naturally endear to our&s;elves tho&s;e to whom we impart any kind of plea|&s;ure, becau&s;e we imagine their affection and e&s;teem &s;ecured to us by the benefits which they receive.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed another method by which the pride of &s;uperiority may be likewi&s;e gra|tified. He that has extingui&s;hed all the &s;en|&s;ations of humanity, and has no longer any &s;atisfaction in the reflection that he is loved as the di&s;tributer of happine&s;s, may plea&s;e him&s;elf with exciting terror as the inflicter of mi&s;ery; he may delight his &s;olitude with contemplating the extent of his power and the force of his commands, in imagining the de&s;ires that flutter on the tongue which is forbidden to utter them, or the di&s;content which preys on the heart in which fear con|fines it; he may amu&s;e him&s;elf with new contrivances of detection, multiplications of prohibition, and varieties of puni&s;hment; and &s;well with exultation when he con&s;iders how little of the homage that he receives he owes to choice.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">
THAT princes of this character have been known the hi&s;tory of all ab&s;olute kingdoms will inform us; and &s;ince, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob|&s;erves, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>the government of a family is naturally monarchical,</HI> it is like other monarchies too often arbitrarily admini&s;tered. The regal and parental tyrant differ only in the extent of their dominions, and the num|ber of their &s;laves. The &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions cau&s;e the &s;ame mi&s;eries; except that &s;eldom any prince however de&s;potick, has &s;o far &s;haken off all awe of the publick eye as to venture upon tho&s;e freaks of inju&s;tice, which are &s;ometimes indulged under the &s;ecrecy of a private dwelling. Capricious injunctions, par|tial deci&s;ions, unequal allotments, di&s;tribu|tions of reward not by merit but by fancy, and puni&s;hments regulated not by the degree of the offence but by the humour of the judge, are too frequent where no power is known but that of a father.</P>
<P>THAT he delights in the mi&s;ery of others no man will con&s;e&s;s, and yet what other mo|tive can make a father cruel? the king may be in&s;tigated by one man to the de&s;truction
<PB N="106" REF="107">
of another; he may &s;ometimes think him&s;elf endangered by the virtues of a &s;ubject; he may dread the &s;ucce&s;sful general or the po|pular orator; his avarice may point out gol|den confi&s;cations; and his guilt may whi&s;|per that he can only be &s;ecure, by cutting off all power of revenge.</P>
<P>BUT what can a parent hope from the op|pre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who were born to his pro|tection, of tho&s;e who can di&s;turb him with no competition, who can enrich him with no &s;poils? Why cowards are cruel may be ea&s;ily di&s;covered; but for what rea&s;on not more infamous than cowardice can that man delight in oppre&s;&s;ion who has nothing to fear?</P>
<P>THE unju&s;tifiable &s;everity of a parent is loaded with this aggravation, that tho&s;e whom he injures are always in his &s;ight. The in|ju&s;tice of a prince is often exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e of whom he never had any per&s;onal or particular knowledge; and the &s;entence which he pronounces, whether of bani&s;h|ment impri&s;onment or death, removes from his view the man whom he condemns. But the dome&s;tick oppre&s;&s;or dooms him&s;elf to
<PB N="107" REF="108">
gaze upon tho&s;e faces which he clouds with terror and with &s;orrow; and beholds every moment the effects of his own barbarities. He that can bear to give continual pain to tho&s;e who &s;urround him, and can walk with &s;atisfaction in the gloom of his own pre&s;ence: he that can &s;ee &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive mi&s;ery without re|lenting, and meet without emotion the eye that implores mercy, or demands ju&s;tice, will &s;carcely be amended by remon&s;trance or admonition; he has found means of &s;top|ping the avenues of tenderne&s;s, and arming his heart again&s;t the force of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>EVEN though no con&s;ideration &s;hould be paid to the great law of &s;ocial beings, by which every individual is commanded to con|&s;ult the happine&s;s of others, yet the har&s;h pa|rent is le&s;s to be vindicated than any other criminal, becau&s;e he le&s;s provides for the happine&s;s of him&s;elf. Every man however little he loves others would willingly be loved; every man hopes to live long, and therefore hopes for that time at which he &s;hall &s;ink back to imbecillity, and mu&s;t depend for ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s upon the officiou&s;|ne&s;s of others. But how has he obviated the
<PB N="108" REF="109">
inconveniencies of old age, who alienates from him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his children, and who&s;e bed mu&s;t be &s;urrounded in his la&s;t hours, in the hours of languor and dejection of impatience and of pain, by &s;trangers to whom his life is indifferent, or by enemies to whom his death is de&s;irable.</P>
<P>PIETY will indeed in good minds over|come re&s;entment, and tho&s;e who have been harra&s;&s;ed by brutality will forget the inju|ries which they have &s;uffered &s;o far as to per|form the la&s;t duties with alacrity and zeal. But &s;urely no re&s;entment can be equally painful with kindne&s;s thus unde&s;erved, nor can &s;everer puni&s;hment be imprecated upon a man not wholly lo&s;t in meanne&s;s and &s;tu|pidity, than through the tediou&s;ne&s;s of decrepi|tude, to be reproached by the kindne&s;s of his own children, to receive not the tribute but the alms of attendance, and to owe every re|lief of his mi&s;eries not to gratitude but to mercy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO depravity of the mind has been more frequently or ju&s;tly cen&s;ured than in|gratitude. There is indeed &s;ufficient rea|&s;on for looking on tho&s;e that can return evil for good, and repay kindne&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance with hatred or neglect, as corrupted beyond the common degrees of wickedne&s;s; nor will he who has once been clearly detected in acts of injury to his benefactor, de&s;erve to be numbered among &s;ocial beings; he has en|deavoured to de&s;troy confidence, to intercept
<PB N="110" REF="111">
&s;ympathy, and to turn every man's atten|tion wholly on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is always danger left the hone&s;t abhorrence of a crime &s;hould rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions with too much violence again&s;t the man to whom it is imputed. In proportion as guilt is more enormous, it ought to be a&s;certained by &s;tronger evidence. The charge again&s;t ingratitude is very general; almo&s;t every man can tell what favours he has conferred upon in&s;en&s;ibility, and how much happine&s;s he has be&s;towed without return; but perhaps if the&s;e patrons and protectors were con|fronted with any whom they boa&s;t of having befriended, it would often appear that they over-rate their benevolence, that they con|&s;ulted only their plea&s;ure or vanity, and repaid them&s;elves their petty donatives by gratifications of in&s;olence and indulgence of contempt.</P>
<P>IT has happened that much of my time has been pa&s;&s;ed in a dependant &s;tate, and con&s;equently I have received many &s;avours in the opinion of tho&s;e at who&s;e expence I have been maintained; yet I do not feel in
<PB N="111" REF="112">
in my heart any burning gratitude or tumul|tuous affection; and as I would not willingly &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of virtuous pa&s;&s;ions than the re&s;t of mankind, I &s;hall lay the hi&s;tory of my life before you, that you may by your judgment of my conduct, ei|ther reform or confirm my pre&s;ent &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>MY father was the &s;econd &s;on of a very antient and wealthy family. He married a lady of equal birth, who&s;e fortune, joined to his own, might have &s;upported him and his po&s;terity in honour and plenty; but being gay and ambitious, he prevailed on his friends, to procure him a po&s;t, which gave him op|portunity of di&s;playing in publick his ele|gance and politene&s;s. My mother was equally plea&s;ed with &s;plendor, and equally carele&s;s of expence; they both ju&s;tified their profu|&s;ion to them&s;elves, by endeavouring to be|lieve it nece&s;&s;ary to the exten&s;ion of their ac|quaintance and improvement of their intere&s;t; and whenever any place became vacant, they expected to be repaid by di&s;tinction and ad|vancement. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;chemes and hopes my father was &s;natched away by
<PB N="112" REF="113">
an apoplexy; and my mother, who had no plea&s;ure but in dre&s;s, equipage, a&s;&s;emblies and compliments, finding that &s;he could live no longer in her accu&s;tomed rank, &s;unk into de|jection, and in two years wore out her life with envy and di&s;content.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;ent with a &s;i&s;ter, one year younger than my&s;elf, to the elder brother of my father. We were not yet capable of ob&s;erving how much fortune influences affection, but flattered our&s;elves on the road with the ten|derne&s;s and regard with which we &s;hould doubtle&s;s be treated by our uncle. Our re|ception was rather frigid than malignant; we were introduced to our young cou&s;ins, and for the fir&s;t month more frequently con|&s;oled than upbraided; but in a &s;hort time we found our prattle repre&s;&s;ed, our dre&s;s ne|glected, our endearments unregarded, and our reque&s;ts referred to the hou&s;ekeeper.</P>
<P>THE forms of decency were now viola|ted, and every day produced new in|&s;ults. We were &s;oon brought to the nece&s;&s;ity of receding from our imagined equality with our cou&s;ins, to whom we &s;unk into humble
<PB N="113" REF="114">
companions without choice or influence, ex|pected only to echo their opinions, facilitate their de&s;ires, and accompany their rambles. It was unfortunate that our early intro|duction into polite company and habitual knowledge of the arts of civility, had given us &s;uch an appearance of &s;uperiority to the aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s of our relations, as na|turally drew re&s;pect and preference from e|very &s;tranger who happened on any occa&s;ion to enter the hou&s;e; and my aunt was forced to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of her own children, while they were &s;culking in corners for fear of notice and hanging down their heads in &s;ilent confu&s;ion, by relating the indi&s;cretion of our father, di&s;playing her own kindne&s;s, lamenting the mi&s;ery of birth without e&s;tate, and declaring her anxiety for our future pro|vi&s;ion, and the expedients which &s;he had formed to &s;ecure us from tho&s;e follies or crimes, to which the conjunction of pride and want often gives occa&s;ion. In a &s;hort time care was taken to prevent &s;uch vexa|tious mi&s;takes; we were told, that fine cloaths would only fill our heads with fal&s;e expectations, and our dre&s;s was therefore ac|commodated to our fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
CHILDHOOD is not ea&s;ily dejected or mor|tified. We felt no la&s;ting pain from in&s;olence or neglect, but finding that we were favoured and commended by all who&s;e intere&s;t did not prompt them to di&s;countenance us, pre&s;erved our vivacity and &s;pirit to years of greater &s;en&s;i|bility. It then became irk&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting to live without any principle of action but the will of another, and we often met privately in the garden to lament our condition, and to ea&s;e our hearts with mutual narratives of caprice peevi&s;hne&s;s and affront.</P>
<P>THERE are innumerable modes of in&s;ult and tokens of contempt, for which it is not ea&s;y to find a name, which vani&s;h to nothing in an attempt to de&s;cribe them, and yet may by continual repetition, make day pa&s;s after day in &s;orrow and in terror. Phra&s;es of cur|&s;ory compliment and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;alutation may by a different modulation of the voice or ca&s;t of the countenance convey contrary meanings, and be changed from indications of re&s;pect to expre&s;&s;ions of &s;corn. The dependant who cul|tivates delicacy in him&s;elf very little con&s;ults his own tranquillity. My unhappy vigilance is every moment di&s;covering &s;ome petulance
<PB N="115" REF="116">
of accent, or arrogance of mien, &s;ome vehe|mence of interrogation, or quickne&s;s of reply that recals my poverty to my mind, and which I feel more acutely as I know not how to re|&s;ent it.</P>
<P>YOU are not however to imagine that I think my&s;elf di&s;charged from the duties of gratitude, only becau&s;e my relations do not adju&s;t their looks or tune their voices to my expectation. The in&s;olence of benefaction ter|minates not in negative rudene&s;s or obliquities of in&s;ult. I am often told in expre&s;s terms of the mi&s;eries from which charity has &s;natched me, while multitudes are &s;uffered by relations equally near to devolve upon the pari&s;h; and have more than once heard it numbered among other favours that I am admitted to the &s;ame table with my cou&s;ins.</P>
<P>THAT I &s;it at the fir&s;t table I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, but I &s;it there only that I may feel the &s;tings of inferiority. My enquiries are neglected, my opinion is overborn, my a&s;&s;er|tions are controverted; and, as in&s;olence always propagates it&s;elf, the &s;ervants overlook me in imitation of their ma&s;ter; if I call mode&s;tly,
<PB N="116" REF="117">
I am not heard, if loudly, my u&s;urpation of authority is checked by a general frown. I am often obliged to look uninvited upon delicacies, and &s;ometimes de&s;ired to ri&s;e up|on very &s;light pretences.</P>
<P>THE incivilities to which I am expo&s;ed would give me le&s;s pain were they not aggra|vated by the tears of my &s;i&s;ter, whom the young ladies are hourly tormenting with every art of feminine per&s;ecution. As it is &s;aid of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate of <HI>Venice</HI> that he is a prince in one place and a &s;lave in another, my &s;i&s;ter is a &s;ervant to her cou&s;ins in their apart|ments, and a companion only at the table. Her wit and beauty draw &s;o much regard away from them, that they never &s;uffer her to ap|pear with them in any place where they &s;olicit notice, or expect admiration, and when they are vi&s;ited by neighbouring ladies and pa&s;s their hours in dome&s;tic amu&s;ements, &s;he is &s;ometimes called to fill a vacancy, in&s;ulted with contemptuous freedoms, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to her needle when her place is &s;upplied. The heir has of late by the in&s;tigation of his &s;i&s;ters begun to harra&s;s her with clowni&s;h jocularity; he &s;eems inclined to make his fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ays
<PB N="117" REF="118">
of waggery upon her, and by the connivance, if not encouragement of his father, treats her with &s;uch licentious brutality, as I cannot bear though I cannot puni&s;h it.</P>
<P>I BEG to be informed Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> how much we can be &s;uppo&s;ed to owe to beneficence, exerted on terms like the&s;e? to beneficence which polutes its gifts with contumely, and may be truly &s;aid to pander to pride? I would willingly be told, whether in&s;olence does not reward its own liberalities, and whether he that exacts &s;ervility, can with ju&s;tice at the &s;ame time expect affection?</P>

<P>AS daily experience makes it evident that misfortunes are unavoidably incident to human life, that calamity will neither be repelled by fortitude, nor e&s;caped by flight, neither awed by greatne&s;s, nor eluded by ob&s;curity; philo&s;ophers have endeavoured to reconcile us to that condition which they cannot teach us to mend, by per&s;uading us that mo&s;t of our evils are made afflictive only by ignorance or perver&s;ene&s;s, and that nature has annexed to every vici&s;&s;itude of external circum&s;tances, &s;ome advantage &s;uffi|cient to overbalance all its inconveniencies.</P>
<P>THIS attempt may perhaps be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|pected of re&s;emblance to the practice of phy|&s;icians, who when they cannot mitigate pain de&s;troy &s;en&s;ibility, and endeavour to conceal by opiates the inefficacy of their other me|dicines. The panegyri&s;ts of calamity have more frequently gained applau&s;e to their wit, than acquie&s;cence to their arguments; nor
<PB N="119" REF="120">
has it appeared that the mo&s;t mu&s;ical oratory or &s;ubtle ratiocination has been able long to overpower the angui&s;h of oppre&s;&s;ion, the te|diou&s;ne&s;s of languor, or the longings of want.</P>
<P>YET it may be generally remarked that, where much has been attempted, &s;omething has been performed; though the di&s;coveries or acqui&s;itions of man are not always adequate to the expectations of his pride, they are at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to animate his indu&s;try. The an|tidotes with which philo&s;ophy has medicated the cup of life, though they cannot give it &s;alubrity and &s;weetne&s;s, have at lea&s;t allayed its bitterne&s;s, and contempered its malignity; the balm which &s;he drops upon the wounds of the mind, abates their pain though it can|not heal them.</P>
<P>BY &s;uffering willingly what we cannot a|void, we &s;ecure our&s;elves from vain and im|moderate di&s;quiet; we pre&s;erve for better purpo&s;es that &s;trength which would be unpro|fitably wa&s;ted in wild efforts of de&s;peration, and maintain that circum&s;pection which may enable us to &s;eize every &s;upport, and im|prove every alleviation. This calmne&s;s will
<PB N="120" REF="121">
be more ea&s;ily obtained, as the attention is more powerfully withdrawn from the con|templation of unmingled unabated evil, and diverted to tho&s;e accidental benefits which prudence may confer on every &s;tate.</P>
<P>SENECA has attempted not only to pacify us in misfortune, but almo&s;t to allure us to it, by repre&s;enting it as nece&s;&s;ary to the plea|&s;ures of the mind. <HI>He that never was ac|quainted with adver&s;ity,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has &s;een the world but on one &s;ide, and is ignorant of half the &s;cenes of nature.</HI> He invites his pupil to calamity, as the Syrens allured the pa&s;&s;enger to their coa&s;ts, by promi&s;ing that he &s;hall re|turn <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, with encrea&s;e of knowledge, with enlarged views, and multiplied ideas.</P>
<P>CURIOSITY is, in great and generous minds, the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion and the la&s;t; and perhaps always predominates in proportion to the &s;trength of the contemplative faculties. He who ea&s;ily comprehends all that is be|fore him, and &s;oon exhau&s;ts any &s;ingle &s;ub|ject, is always eager for new enquiries, and in proportion as the intellectual eye takes in a wider pro&s;pect, it mu&s;t be gratified with va|riety

<P>WHEN <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> in <HI>Valerius Flaccus,</HI> would incline the young prince <HI>Aca&s;tus</HI> to accom|pany him in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of navigation, he di&s;per&s;es his apprehen&s;ions of danger by re|pre&s;entations of the new tracts of earth and heaven which the expedition would &s;pread before their eyes; and tells him with what grief he will hear at their return, of the coun|tries which they &s;hall have &s;een, and the toils which they have &s;urmounted.<Q><L>O quantum terae, quantum cogno&s;cere coeli</L>

<P>IF therefore it can be proved that di&s;tre&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of knowledge, and that a happy &s;ituation hides from us &s;o large a part of the field of meditation, the envy of many who repine at the fight of af|fluence and &s;plendor will be much dimini&s;h|ed; for &s;uch is the delight of mental &s;uperio|rity, that none on whom nature or &s;tudy have conferred it, would purcha&s;e the gifts of fortune by its lo&s;s.</P>

<P>THE writers of medicine and phy&s;iology have traced with great appearance of accuracy, the effects of time upon the hu|man body, by marking the various periods of the con&s;titution, and the &s;everal &s;tages by which animal life makes its progre&s;s from in|fancy to decrepitude. Though their ob&s;er|vations have not enabled them to di&s;cover how manhood may be accelerated, or old age retarded, yet &s;urely if they be con&s;idered only as the amu&s;ements of curio&s;ity, they are of equal importance with conjectures on things more remote, with catalogues of the fixed &s;tars, and calculations of the bulk of planets.</P>
<P>IT had been a ta&s;k worthy of the moral philo&s;ophers to have con&s;idered with equal

<P>THE periods of mental change are not to be &s;tated with equal certainty: Our bodies grow up under the care of nature, and depend &s;o lit|tle on our own management, that &s;omething more than negligence is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;com|po&s;e their &s;tructure, or impede their vigour. But our minds are committed in a great mea&s;ure fir&s;t to the direction of others and afterwards of our&s;elves. It would be diffi|cult to protract the weakne&s;s of infancy be|yond the u&s;ual time, but the mind may be very ea&s;ily hindered from its &s;hare of im|provement, and the bulk and &s;trength of manhood mu&s;t, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of edu|cation and in&s;truction, be informed only with the under&s;tanding of a child.</P>
<P>YET amid&s;t all the di&s;order and inequality which variety of di&s;cipline, example, con|ver&s;ation, and employment produce in the intellectual advances of different men, there is &s;till di&s;covered by a vigilant &s;pectator &s;uch a

general and remote &s;imilitude as may be ex|pected in the &s;ame common nature affected by external circum&s;tances indefinitely varied. We all enter the world in equal ignorance, gaze round about us on the &s;ame objects, and have our fir&s;t pains and plea&s;ures, our fir&s;t hopes and fears, our fir&s;t aver&s;ions and de|&s;ires from the &s;ame cau&s;es; and though as we proceed farther, life opens wider pro&s;pects to our view, and accidental impul&s;es determine as to different paths, yet as every mind, how|ever vigorous or ab&s;tracted, is nece&s;&s;itated in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of union to receive its infor|mations, and execute its purpo&s;es by the in|tervention of the body, the uniformity of our corporeal nature communicates it&s;elf to our intellectual operations; and tho&s;e who&s;e abilities or knowledge incline them mo&s;t to deviate from the general round of life, are recalled from their excentricity by the laws of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the exerci&s;es of the mind, it will be found that in each part of life &s;ome particular faculty is more eminently employ|ed. When the trea&s;ures of knowledge are fir&s;t opened before us, while novelty blooms

<P>WHEN a number of di&s;tinct images are col|lected by the&s;e erratick and ha&s;ty &s;urveys, the fancy is bu&s;ied in arranging them; and com|bines them into plea&s;ing pictures with more re&s;emblance to the realities of life as expe|rience advances, and new ob&s;ervations recti|fy the former. While the judgment is yet uninformed and unable to compare the draughts of fiction with their originals, we are delighted with improbable adventures, impracticable virtues, and inimitable charac|ters: But in proportion, as we have more opportunities of acquainting our&s;elves with living nature, we are &s;ooner di&s;gu&s;ted with copies in which there appear, no re&s;emblance.

<P>NOW commences the reign of judg|ment or rea&s;on; we begin to find little plea&s;ure, but in comparing arguments, &s;ta|ting propo&s;itions, di&s;entangling perplexities, clearing ambiguities, and deducing con&s;e|quences. The painted vales of imagination are de&s;erted, and our intellectual activity is exerci&s;ed in winding through the labyrinths of fallacy, and toiling with firm and cauti|ous &s;teps up the narrow tracks of demon&s;tra|tion. Whatever may lull vigilance, or mi&s;|lead attention is contemptuou&s;ly rejected, and every di&s;gui&s;e in which error may be con|cealed, is carefully ob&s;erved, till by degrees a certain number of inconte&s;table or un&s;u&s;|pected propo&s;itions are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and at la&s;t concatenated into arguments, or com|pacted into &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">
At length wearine&s;s &s;ucceeds to labour, and the mind lies at ea&s;e in the contempla|tion of her own attainment; without any de|&s;ire of new conque&s;ts or excur&s;ions. This is the age of recollection and narrative; the opinions are &s;ettled, and the avenues of ap|prehen&s;ion &s;hut again&s;t any new intelligence; the days that are to follow mu&s;t pa&s;s in the inculcation of precepts already collected, and a&s;&s;ertion of tenets already received; nothing is henceforward &s;o odious as oppo&s;ition, &s;o in&s;olent as doubt, or &s;o dangerous as noveity.</P>
<P>IN like manner the pa&s;&s;ions u&s;urp the &s;epa|rate command of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods of life. To the happine&s;s of our fir&s;t years nothing more &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary than free|dom from re&s;traint: Every man may remem|ber that if he was left to him&s;elf, and indulged in the di&s;po&s;al of his own time, he was once content without the &s;uperaddition of any ac|tual plea&s;ure. The new world is it&s;elf a ban|quet, and till we have exhau&s;ted the fre&s;h|ne&s;s of life, we have always about us &s;uffici|ent grati&s;ications: The &s;un&s;hine quickens us to play, and the &s;hade invites us to &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">
BUT we &s;oon become un&s;atisfied with ne|gative felicity, and are &s;olicited by our &s;en&s;es and appetites to more powerful delights, as the ta&s;te of him who has &s;atisfied his hunger mu&s;t be excited by artificial &s;timulations. The &s;implicity of natural amu&s;ement is now pa&s;t, and art and contrivance mu&s;t improve our plea&s;ures; but in time art like nature is ex|hau&s;ted, and the &s;en&s;es can no longer &s;upply the cravings of the intellect.</P>
<P>THE attention is then transferred from plea&s;ure to intere&s;t, in which plea&s;ure is per|haps included, though diffu&s;ed to a wider extent, and protracted through new grada|tions. Nothing now dances before the eyes but wealth and power, nor rings in the ear but the voice of fame; wealth, to which, however variou&s;ly denominated, every man at &s;ome time or other a&s;pires, power, which all wi&s;h to obtain within their circle of action, and fame, which no man, however high or mean, however wi&s;e or ignorant, was yet able to de&s;pi&s;e. Now prudence and fore&s;ight exert their influence: No hour is devoted wholly to any pre&s;ent enjoyment, no act or

purpo&s;e terminates in it&s;elf, but every motion is referred to &s;ome di&s;tant end; the accom|pli&s;hment of one de&s;ign begins another, and the ultimate wi&s;h is always pu&s;hed off to its former di&s;tance.</P>
<P>AT length fame is ob&s;erved to be uncertain, and power to be dangerous; the man who&s;e vigour and alacrity begin to for&s;ake him, by degrees contracts his de&s;igns, remits his former multiplicity of per&s;uits, and extends no longer his regard to any other honour than the repu|tation of wealth, or any other influence than its power. Avarice is generally the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e lives of which the fir&s;t part has been &s;quandered in plea&s;ure, and the &s;econd devoted to ambition. He that &s;inks under the fatigue of getting wealth, lulls his age with the milder bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;aving it.</P>
<P>I HAVE in this view of life con&s;idered men as actuated only by natural de&s;ires, and yielding to their own inclinations without regard to &s;uperior principles by which the force of ex|ternal agents may be counteracted, and the temporary prevalence of pa&s;&s;ions re&s;trained.

de&s;ires will be always ranging from one object to another; but the&s;e motions though very powerful are not re&s;i&s;tle&s;s; nature may be regu|lated, and de&s;ires governed; and to contend with the predominance of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ions, to be endangered fir&s;t by one affection, and then by another, is the condition upon which we are to pa&s;s our time, the time of our pre|paration for that &s;tate which &s;hall put an end to experiment, to di&s;appointment, and to change.</P>

<P>"IT was the wi&s;dom, &s;ays <HI>Seneca,</HI> of antient times, to con&s;ider what is mo&s;t u&s;eful as mo&s;t illu&s;trious." If this rule be ob&s;erved with regard to works of genius, &s;carcely any &s;pecies of compo&s;ition de&s;erves more to be cultivated than the epi&s;tolary &s;tile, &s;ince none is of more various or frequent u&s;e, through the whole&s;ubordination of human life.</P>
<P>IT has yet happened that among the nume|rous Writers which our nation has produced,

equal perhaps always in force and genius, and of late in elegance and accuracy to tho&s;e of any other country, very few have endeavoured to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the publication of letters, except &s;uch as were written in the di&s;charge of publick tru&s;ts, and during the tran&s;action of great affairs, which though they afford precedents to the mini&s;ter, and memo|rials to the hi&s;torian, are of no u&s;e as ex|amples of the familiar &s;tile, or models of private corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>IF it be enquired by foreigners how this deficiency has happened in the literature of a country, where all indulge them&s;elves with &s;o little danger in &s;peaking and writing, may we not without either bigotry or arrogance inform them, that it mu&s;t be imputed to our con|tempt of trifles, and our due &s;en&s;e of the dig|nity of the publick? We do not think it rea&s;onable to fill the world with volumes from which nothing can be learned, nor expect that the employments of the bu&s;y, or the amu&s;e|ments of the gay, &s;hould give way to nar|ratives of our private affairs, complaints of ab&s;ence, expre&s;&s;ions of fondne&s;s, or declara|tions of fidelity.</P>

PRECEPT has generally been po&s;terior to performance. The art of compo&s;ing works of genius has never been taught but by the example of tho&s;e who performed it by natural vigour of imagination, and rectitude of judg|ment. As we have few letters, we have like|wi&s;e few critici&s;ms upon the epi&s;tolary &s;tile. The ob&s;ervations with which <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> has in|troduced his pages of inanity are &s;uch as give him little claim to the rank a&s;&s;igned him by <HI>Dryden</HI> among the criticks. <HI>Letters,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are intended as re&s;emblances of conver&s;ation, and the chief excellencies of conver&s;ation are good humour and good breeding.</HI> This remark, equally valuable for its novelty and propriety, he dilates and enforces with an appearance of compleat acquie&s;cence in his own di&s;covery.</P>
<P>NO Man was ever in doubt about the moral qualities of a letter. It has been always known that he who endeavours to plea&s;e mu&s;t appear plea&s;ed, and he who would not provoke rude|ne&s;s mu&s;t not practi&s;e it. But the que&s;tion among tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;h rules for an epi&s;to|lary performance is how gaiety or civility may be properly expre&s;&s;ed, as among the criticks
<PB N="138" REF="139">
in hi&s;tory it is not conte&s;ted whether truth ought to be pre&s;erved, but by what mode of diction it is be&s;t adorned.</P>
<P>AS letters are written on all &s;ubjects, in all &s;tates of mind, they cannot be properly reduced to &s;ettled rules, or de&s;cribed by any &s;ingle characteri&s;tic; and we may &s;afely di&s;entangle our minds from critical embarra&s;|ments, by determining that a letter has no peculiarity but its form, and that nothing is to be refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion which would be pro|per in any other method of treating the &s;ame &s;ubject. The qualities of the epi&s;tolary &s;tile mo&s;t frequently required are ea&s;e and &s;impli|city, an even flow of unlaboured diction, and an artle&s;s arrangement of obvious &s;entiments. But the&s;e directions are no &s;ooner applied to u&s;e, than their &s;eantine&s;s and imperfection became evident. Letters are written to the great and to the mean, to the learned and the ignorant, at re&s;t and in di&s;tre&s;s, in &s;port and in pa&s;&s;ion. Nothing can be more improper than ea&s;e and laxity of expre&s;&s;ion, when the importance of the &s;ubject impre&s;&s;es &s;olicitude, or the dignity of the per&s;on exacts reverence.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
THAT letters &s;hould be written with &s;trict conformity to nature is true, becau&s;e nothing but conformity to nature can make any com|po&s;ition beautiful or ju&s;t. But it is natural to depart from familiarity of language upon occa|&s;ions not familiar: Whatever elevates the &s;en|timents will con&s;equently rai&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion; whatever fills us with hope or terror will pro|duce &s;ome perturbation of images, and &s;ome figurative di&s;tortions of phra&s;e. Wherever we are &s;tudious to plea&s;e we are afraid of tru&s;ting our fir&s;t thoughts, and endeavour to recommend our opinion by &s;tudied ornaments, accuracy of method, and elegance of &s;tile.</P>
<P>IF the per&s;onages of the comick &s;cene, be allowed by <HI>Horace</HI> to rai&s;e their language in the tran&s;ports of anger to the turgid vehe|mence of tragedy, the epi&s;tolary writer may likewi&s;e without cen&s;ure comply with the varieties of his matter. If great events are to be related, he may with all the &s;olemnity of an hi&s;torian, deduce them from their cau&s;es, connect them with their concomitants, and trace them to their con&s;equences. If a di&s;|puted po&s;ition is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or a remote
<PB N="140" REF="141">
principle to be inve&s;tigated, he may detail his rea&s;onings with all the nicety of &s;yllogi&s;tick method. If a menace is to be averted, or a benefit implored, he may without any viola|tion of the edicts of critici&s;m call every power of rhetorick to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and try every inlet at which love or pity enters the heart.</P>
<P>LETTERS that have no other end than the entertainment of the corre&s;pondent are more properly regulated by critical precepts, becau&s;e the matter and &s;tile are equally arbitrary, and rules are more nece&s;&s;ary, as there is larger power of choice. In letters of this kind, &s;ome conceive art graceful, and others think negli|gence amiable; &s;ome model them by the &s;on|net, and will allow them no means of delighting but the &s;oft lap&s;e of calm melli|fluence; others adju&s;t them by the epigram, and expect pointed &s;entences and forcible periods. The one party con&s;iders exemption from faults as the height of excellence, the other looks upon neglect of excellence as the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting fault; one avoids cen&s;ure, the other a&s;pires to prai&s;e; one is always in danger of in&s;ipidity, the other continually on the brink of affectation.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are certain occa&s;ions on which all apology is rudene&s;s. He that has an unwelcome me&s;&s;age to deliver, or un|happy incident to relate, may perhaps give &s;ome proof of tenderne&s;s and delicacy, by a ceremonial introduction and gradual di&s;covery, becau&s;e the mind, upon which the weight of &s;orrow is to fail, gains time for the collection of its powers; but nothing is more ab&s;urd than to delay the communication of Plea&s;ure, to torment curio&s;ity by impatience, and to delude hope by anticipation.</P>
<P>I SHALL forbear the arts by which cor|re&s;pondents are generally careful to &s;ecure admi&s;&s;ion, for I have had too many oppor|tunities of remarking the power of vanity and intere&s;t, to doubt that I &s;hall be read
<PB N="143" REF="144">
by you with a di&s;po&s;ition to approve, when I declare that my narrative has no other tendency than to illu&s;trate and corroborate your own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I WAS the &s;econd &s;on of a gentleman, who&s;e patrimony had been wa&s;ted by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;quanderers till he was unable to &s;upport any of his children except his heir in the hereditary dignity of idlene&s;s. Being therefore &s;ent to &s;chool, and obliged to em|ploy that part of life in &s;tudy which my pro|genitors had devoted to the hawk and hound, I was in my eighteenth year di&s;patched with loud prai&s;es from my ma&s;ter to the uni|ver&s;ity, without any rural honours or accom|pli&s;hments. I had never killed a &s;ingle wood|cock, nor partaken one triumph over a con|quered fox.</P>
<P>AT the univer&s;ity I continued to enlarge my acqui&s;itions with very little envy of the noi&s;y happine&s;s which my elder brother had the fortune to enjoy, and having obtained my degree at the u&s;ual time, retired into the country to con&s;ider at lei&s;ure to what pro|fe&s;&s;ion I &s;hould confine that application,
<PB N="144" REF="145">
which had hitherto been di&s;&s;ipated in general knowledge. To deliberate upon a choice which cu&s;tom and honour forbid to be retracted, is certainly rea&s;onable, yet to let loo&s;e the atten|tion equally to the advantages and inconve|niencies of every employment is not without danger; new motives are every moment ope|rating on every &s;ide; and mechanicks have long ago di&s;covered, that contrariety of equal attractions is equivalent to re&s;t.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus trifling in uncertainty, an old adventurer who had been once the intimate friend of my father arrived from the <HI>Indies</HI> with a large fortune, which he had &s;o much harra&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in obtaining, that &s;ickne&s;s and infirmity left him no other de|&s;ire than to die in his native country. His wealth ea&s;ily procured him an invitation to pa&s;s his life with us, and being incapable of any amu&s;ement but conver&s;ation, he ne|ce&s;&s;arily became familiari&s;ed to me, whom he found &s;tudious and dome&s;tick. Plea&s;ed with an opportunity of imparting my know|ledge, and eager of any intelligence that might encrea&s;e it, I delighted his curio&s;ity with hi&s;to|rical narratives, &s;y&s;tems of policy, and ex|plications
<PB N="145" REF="146">
of nature, and gratified his vanity by frequent enquiries after the products of di&s;tant countries, and the cu&s;toms of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>MY Brother &s;aw how much I advanced in favour of our gue&s;t, who being without heirs was naturally expected to enrich the family of his friend, but neither attempted to alienate me, nor to ingratiate him&s;elf. He was indeed little qualified to &s;olicit the af|fection of an old traveller, for the remi&s;ne&s;s of his education had left him without any rule of action, but his pre&s;ent humour. He often for&s;ook the old gentleman in the mid&s;t of an adventure, becau&s;e the horn &s;ounded in the court-yard, and would have lo&s;t an op|portunity, not only of knowing the hi&s;tory, but &s;haring the wealth of the Mogul, for the trial of a new pointer, or the &s;ight of a hor&s;e-race.</P>
<P>IT was therefore not long before our new friend declared his intention of bequeathing to me the profits of his commerce, as the only man in the family by whom he could
<PB N="146" REF="147">
expect them to be rationally enjoyed. This di&s;tinction drew upon me the envy not only of my brother but my father. As no man is willing to believe that he &s;uffers by his own fault, they imputed the preference which I had obtained to artifice and fraud, adula|tory compliances or malignant calumnies. To no purpo&s;e did I call upon my patron to atte&s;t my innocence, for who will believe what he wi&s;hes to be fal&s;e? The &s;ame heat and ignorance which gave me the fir&s;t ad|vantage confirmed my &s;uperiority, they for|ced their inmate by repeated in&s;ults to depart from the hou&s;e, and I was &s;oon by the &s;ame treatment obliged to follow him.</P>
<P>HE cho&s;e his re&s;idence in the confines of <HI>London,</HI> where re&s;t tranquility and medicine re&s;tored him to part of the health which he had lo&s;t. I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with perceiving that I was not likely to obtain an immediate po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of wealth, which no labour of mine had contributed to acquire; and that he who had thus di&s;tingui&s;hed me, might hope to obtain a few years of chearfulne&s;s and plenty, and end his life without a total fru&s;tration of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which, whatever be their real
<PB N="147" REF="148">
value, he had &s;ought with &s;o much diligence, and purcha&s;ed with &s;o many vici&s;&s;itudes of danger and fatigue.</P>
<P>HE indeed left me no rea&s;on to repine at his recovery, for he was willing to accu&s;tom me early to the u&s;e of money, and &s;et a|part for my annual expences &s;uch a revenue as I had &s;carcely dared to image to my&s;elf in the warme&s;t moments of hope and ambition. I can yet congratulate my&s;elf that fortune has &s;een her golden cup once ta&s;ted without inebriation. Neither my mode&s;ty nor pro|dence were overwhelmed by affluence; my elevation was without in&s;olence, and my ex|pence without profu&s;ion. Employing the in|fluence which money always confers, to the enlargement of my views and improvement of my under&s;tanding, I mingled &s;ometimes in parties of gaiety, and &s;ometimes in conferences of learning, appeared in every place where in&s;truction was to be found, and imagined that by ranging through all the diver&s;ities of life I had acquainted my|&s;elf fully with human nature, and learned all that was to be known of the ways of men.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149">
IT happened, however, that I &s;oon di&s;co|vered how much was wanting to the comple|tion of my knowledge, and found that, ac|cording to <HI>Seneca</HI>'s remark, I had hitherto &s;een the world but on one &s;ide. My patron's confidence in his encrea&s;e of &s;trength tempted him to carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and irregularity; he caught a &s;ever by riding in the rain, of which he died delitious on the third day. I buried him without any of the heir's af|fected grief or &s;ecret exultation; then prepa|paring to take a legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his for|tune, opened his clo&s;et, where I found a will, made at his fir&s;t arrival, by which my father was appointed the chief inheritor of his riches, and nothing was left me but a le|gacy &s;ufficient to &s;upport me in the pro&s;ecu|tion of my &s;tudies.</P>
<P>I HAD not yet found &s;uch charms in pro&s;|perity as to continue it by any acts of for|gery or inju&s;tice, and made ha&s;te to inform my father of the riches which had been given him, not by &s;ettled kindne&s;s, but by the de|lays of indolence, and the cowardice of age. The hungry family flew like vulturs on their
<PB N="149" REF="150">
prey, and &s;oon made my di&s;appointment pub|lick by the tumult of their claims, and the &s;plendour of their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>IT was now my part to con&s;ider how I &s;hould repair the di&s;appointment which I had &s;uffered. I could not but triumph in my long li&s;t of friends which compri&s;ed almo&s;t every name that power or knowledge entitled to eminence, and in the pro&s;pect of the in|numerable roads to honour and preferment which I had laid open to my&s;elf by the wi&s;e u&s;e of temporary riches. I believed nothing nece&s;&s;ary but that I &s;hould continue that ac|quaintance to which I had been &s;o readily admitted, and which had hitherto been cul|tivated on both &s;ides with equal ardour.</P>
<P>FULL of the&s;e expectations, I one mor|ning ordered a chair, with an intention to make my u&s;ual circle of morning vi&s;its. Where I fir&s;t &s;topped I &s;aw two footmen lol|ling at the door, who told me, without any change of po&s;ture or collection of counte|nance, that their ma&s;ter was at home, and &s;uffered me to open the inner door without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I found my friend &s;tanding, and
<PB N="150" REF="151">
as I was tattling with my former freedom, was formally entreated to &s;it down, but did not &s;tay to be favoured with any farther con|de&s;cen&s;ions.</P>
<P>MY next experiment was made at the levee of a &s;tate&s;man, who received me with an embrace of tenderne&s;s, that he might with more decency publi&s;h my change of fortune to the &s;ycophants about him. After he had enjoyed the triumph of condolence, he turned to a wealthy &s;tockjobber, and left me expo&s;ed to the &s;corn of tho&s;e who had lately courted my notice and &s;olicited my intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I WAS then &s;et down at the door of ano|ther, who upon my entrance advi&s;ed me with great &s;olemnity to think of &s;ome &s;ettled pro|vi&s;ion for life. I left him and hurried away to an old friend, who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf un|&s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions from pro&s;pe|rity or misfortune, and begged that he might &s;ee me when he was more at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>OF &s;ixty-&s;even doors at which I knocked in the fir&s;t week after my appearance in a
<PB N="151" REF="152">
mourning dre&s;s, I was denied admi&s;&s;ion at forty &s;even; was &s;uffered at thirteen to wait in the outer room till bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patched; at four was entertained with a few que&s;tions about the weather; at one heard the footmen rated for bringing my name; and at two was informed in the flow of ca&s;ual conver&s;ation how much a man of rank degrades him&s;elf by mean company.</P>
<P>MY curio&s;ity now led me to try what reception I &s;hould find among the ladies, but I found that my patron had carried all my powers of plea&s;ing to the grave. I had for|merly been celebrated as a wit, and not per|ceiving any langour in my imagination, I e&s;&s;ayed to revive that gaiety which had hi|therto broken out involuntarily before my &s;entences were fini&s;hed. My remarks were now heard with a &s;teady countenance, and if a girl happened to give way to habitual mer|riment, her forwardne&s;s was repre&s;&s;ed with a frown by her mother or her aunt.</P>
<P>WHEREVER I come I &s;catter infirmity and di&s;ea&s;e; every lady whom I meet in the Mall is too weary to walk; all whom I en|treat
<PB N="152" REF="153">
to &s;ing are troubled with colds; if I pro|po&s;e cards they are afflicted with the head|ach; if I invite them to the gardens they cannot bear a crowd.</P>
<P>ALL this might be endured; but there is a cla&s;s of mortals who think my under&s;tand|ing impaired with with my fortune; exalt them&s;elves to the dignity of advice, and whenever we happen to meet, pre&s;ume to pre|&s;cribe my conduct, regulate my oeconomy, and direct my pur&s;uits. Another race equally impertinent and equally de&s;picable, are every moment recommending to me an attention to my intere&s;t, and think them&s;elves en|titled by their &s;uperior prudence to reproach me if I &s;peak or move without regard to profit.</P>
<P>SUCH, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> is the power of wealth, that it commands the car of great|ne&s;s and the eye of beauty, gives &s;pirit to the dull, and authority to the timorous, and leaves him from whom it departs, without virtue and without under&s;tanding, the &s;port of caprice, the &s;coff of in&s;olence, the &s;lave of meanne&s;s, and the pupil of ignorance.</P>

<P>THE direction of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> to tho&s;e that &s;tudy politicks, is, fir&s;t to examine and under&s;tand what has been written by the antients upon government; then to ca&s;t their eyes round upon the world, and con&s;i|der by what cau&s;es the pro&s;perity of commu|nities is vi&s;ibly influenced, and why &s;ome are wor&s;e and others better admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame method mu&s;t be pur&s;ued by him who hopes to become eminent in any other part of knowledge. The fir&s;t ta&s;k is to &s;earch books, the next to contemplato nature. He mu&s;t fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the intellectual trea&s;ures which the diligence of former ages has accumulated, and then endeavour to en|crea&s;e them by his own collections.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
THE mental di&s;ea&s;e of the pre&s;ent gene|ration, is impatience of &s;tudy, contempt of the great ma&s;ters of antient wi&s;dom, and a di&s;po&s;ition to rely wholly upon una&s;&s;i&s;ted genius and natural &s;agacity. The wits of the&s;e happy days have di&s;covered a way to fame, which the dull caution of our labori|ous ance&s;tors dur&s;t never attempt; they cut the knots of &s;ophi&s;try which it was formerly the bu&s;ine&s;s of years to untie; find them|&s;elves enabled to &s;olve all difficulties by &s;ud|den irradiations of intelligence, and compre|hend long proce&s;&s;es of argument by imme|diate intuition.</P>
<P>MEN who have flattered them&s;elves into this opinion of their own abilities, look down on all who wa&s;te their lives over books, as a race of inferior beings condemned by na|ture to perpetual pupillage, qualified for no higher employment than that of propaga|ting opinions implicitly received, and fruitle&s;ly endeavouring to remedy their bar|renne&s;s by ince&s;&s;ant cultivation, or &s;uc|cour their feeblene&s;s by &s;ub&s;idiary &s;trength. They pre&s;ume that none would be more in|du&s;trious
<PB N="155" REF="156">
than they if they were not more &s;en&s;ible of deficiencies, and readily con|clude, that he who places no confidence in his own powers, owes his mode&s;ty only to his weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is however certain that no e&s;timate is more in danger of erroneous calculations than tho&s;e by which a man computes the force of his own genius. It generally happens at our entrance into the world, that by the natural attraction of &s;imilitude, we a&s;&s;ociate with men like our&s;elves young, &s;prightly, and ig|norant, and rate our accompli&s;hments by compari&s;on with theirs; when we have once obtained an acknowledged &s;uperiority over our acquaintances, a warm imagination and &s;trong de&s;ire ea&s;ily extend it over the re&s;t of mankind, and if no accident forces us into new emulations, we grow old and die in admiration of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>VANITY, thus confirmed in her domini|on, readily li&s;tens to the voice of idlene&s;s, and &s;ooths the &s;lumber of life with continual dreams of excellence and greatne&s;s. A man elated by confidence in his natural vigour
<PB N="156" REF="157">
of fancy and &s;agacity of conjecture, &s;oon concludes that he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es whatever toil and enquiry can confer. He then li&s;tens with eagerne&s;s to the wild objections which folly has rai&s;ed again&s;t the common means of improvement; talks of the dark chaos of indige&s;ted knowledge; de&s;cribes the mi&s;chie|vous effects of heterogenous &s;ciences fermen|ting in the mind; relates the blunders of lettered ignorance; expatiates on the hero|ick merit of tho&s;e who deviate from the tracks of pre&s;cription, or &s;hake off the &s;hackles of authority; and gives vent to the inflations of his heart by declaring that he owes no|thing to pedants and univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e preten&s;ions, however confident, are very often vain. The laurels which &s;u|perficial acutene&s;s gains from triumphs over ignorance un&s;upported by vivacity, are ob|&s;erved by <HI>Locke</HI> to be lo&s;t whenever real lear|ning and rational diligence appear again&s;t her; the &s;allies of gaiety are &s;oon repre&s;&s;ed by calm confidence, and the artifices of &s;ubtilty are readily detected by tho&s;e who having careful|ly &s;tudied the que&s;tion, are not ea&s;ily con|founded or &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
BUT though the contemner of books, had neither been deceived by others nor him&s;elf, and was really born with a genius &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the ordinary abilities of mankind; yet &s;urely &s;uch gifts of providence may be more pro|perly urged as incitements to labour, than encouragements to negligence. He that ne|glects the culture of ground, naturally &s;er|tile, is more &s;hamefully culpable than he who&s;e field would &s;carcely recompence his hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P><HI>CICERO</HI> remarks, that not to know what has been tran&s;acted in former times is to con|tinue always a child. If we make no u&s;e of the labours of our ance&s;tors the world mu&s;t remain always in the infancy of knowledge. The di&s;coveries of every man mu&s;t termi|nate in his own advantage, and the &s;tudies of every age be employed on que&s;tions which the pa&s;t generation had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determi|ned. We may with as little reproach make u&s;e of the &s;ciences as the manufactures of our ance&s;tors; and it is as rational to live in caves till our own hands have erected a pa|lace, as to reject all knowledge of architecture, which our under&s;tandings will not &s;upply.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
TO the &s;tronge&s;t and quicke&s;t mind it is far ea&s;ier to learn than to invent. The prin|ciples of arithmetick and geometry may be comprehended by a clo&s;e attention in a few days; yet who can flatter him&s;elf that the &s;tudy of a long life would have enabled him to di&s;cover them, when he &s;ees them yet un|known to &s;o many nations, whom he cannot &s;uppo&s;e le&s;s liberally endowed with natural rea&s;on, than the <HI>Grecians</HI> or <HI>Egyptians?</HI></P>
<P>EVERY &s;cience was thus far advanced to|wards perfection, by the emulous diligence of contemporary &s;tudents, and the gradual di&s;coveries of one age improving on another. Sometimes unexpected fla&s;hes of in&s;truc|tion were &s;truck out by the fortuitous colli|&s;ion of happy incidents, or an involuntary concurrence of ideas, in which the philo&s;o|pher to whom they happened had no other merit than that of knowing their value, and tran&s;mitting unclouded to po&s;terity that light which had been kindled by cau&s;es out of his power. The happine&s;s of the&s;e ca&s;ual illu|minations no man can promi&s;e to him&s;elf, becau&s;e no endeavours can procure them;
<PB N="159" REF="160">
and therefore, whatever be our abilities or ap|plication, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to learn from others what perhaps would have lain hid for ever from human penetration, had not &s;ome re|mote enquiry brought it to view; as trea|&s;ures are thrown up by the ploughman and the digger in the rude exerci&s;e of their com|mon occupations.</P>
<P>THE man who&s;e genius qualifies him for great undertakings, mu&s;t at lea&s;t be content to learn from books the pre&s;ent &s;tate of hu|man knowledge; that he may not a&s;cribe to him&s;elf the invention of arts generally known; weary his attention with experiments of which the event has been long regi&s;tered; and wa&s;te, in attempts which have already &s;uc|ceeded or mi&s;carried, that time which might have been &s;pent with u&s;efulne&s;s and honour upon new undertakings.</P>
<P>BUT though the &s;tudy of books is nece&s;&s;a|ry, it is not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute literary eminence. He that wi&s;hes to be counted a|mong the benefactors of po&s;terity, mu&s;t add by his own toil to the acqui&s;itions of his an|ce&s;tors, and &s;ecure his memory from neglect
<PB N="160" REF="161">
by &s;ome valuable improvement. This can only be effected by looking out upon the wa&s;tes of the intellectual world, and extend|ing the power of learning over regions yet undi&s;ciplined and barbarous; or by &s;urvey|ing more exactly her antient dominions, and driving ignorance from the fortre&s;&s;es and re|treats where &s;he &s;kulks undetected and undi&s;|turbed. Every &s;cience has its difficulties which yet call for &s;olution before we attempt new &s;y&s;tems of knowledge; as every coun|try has its fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes, which it would be wi&s;e to cultivate and drain, before di&s;tant colonies are projected as a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;charge of the exuberance of inhabitants.</P>
<P>NO man ever yet became great by imita|tion. Whatever hopes for the veneration of mankind mu&s;t have invention in the de&s;ign or the execution; either the effect mu&s;t it|&s;elf be new, or the means by which it is produced. Either truths hitherto unknown mu&s;t be di&s;covered, or tho&s;e which are alrea|dy known enforced by &s;tronger evidence, fa|cilitated by clearer method, or elucidated by brighter illu&s;trations.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
Fame cannot &s;pread wide or endure long that is not rooted in nature, and manured by art. That which hopes to re&s;i&s;t the bla&s;t of malignity, and &s;tand firm again&s;t the attacks of time, mu&s;t contain in it&s;elf &s;ome original principle of growth. The reputation which ari&s;es from the detail or tran&s;po&s;ition of bor|rowed &s;entiments may &s;pread for a while, like ivy on the rind of antiquity, but will be torn away by accident or contempt, and &s;uf|fered to rot unheeded on the ground.</P>

<P>NO weakne&s;s of the human mind has more frequently incurred animadver|&s;ion, than the negligence with which men overlook their own faults, however flagrant, and the ea&s;ine&s;s with which they pardon them, however frequently repeated.</P>

<P>WHEN a po&s;ition teems thus with com|modious con&s;equences, who can without re|gret confe&s;s it to be fal&s;e? Yet it is certain that the plea&s;ure of wantoning in flowery pe|riods, and the pride of &s;welling with airy de|clamation has produced a di&s;po&s;ition to de|&s;cribe the dominion of the pa&s;&s;ions as extend|ed beyond the limits that nature has a&s;&s;igned.
<PB N="163" REF="164">
Self-love is often rather arrogant than blind; it does not hide our faults from our|&s;elves, but per&s;uades us, that they e&s;cape the notice of others, and di&s;po&s;es us to re&s;ent cen&s;ures le&s;t we &s;hould confe&s;s them to be ju&s;t, and to claim honours that in our opi|nion we do not merit. We are &s;ecretly con|&s;cious of defects and vices which we hope to conceal from the publick eye, and plea&s;e our&s;elves with the &s;ucce&s;s of innumerable im|po&s;tures, by which, in reality, no body is deceived.</P>
<P>IN proof of the dimne&s;s of our internal &s;ight, or the general inability of man to de|termine rightly concerning his own charac|ter, it is common to urge the &s;ucce&s;s of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and incredible flattery, and the re&s;entment which is always rai&s;ed by advice, however &s;oft, benevolent, and rea&s;onable. But flattery, if its operation be nearly exa|mined, will be found to owe its acceptance not to our ignorance but knowledge of our failures, and to delight us rather as it con&s;oles our wants than di&s;plays our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He that &s;hall &s;olicit the favour of his patron by prai&s;ing him for qualities which he can find
<PB N="164" REF="165">
in him&s;elf, will always be defeated by the more daring panegyri&s;t who enriches him with ad&s;cititious excellence, and plunders antiquity, for the decoration of his name. Ju&s;t prai&s;e is only a debt, but flattery is a pre&s;ent. The acknowledgement of tho&s;e vir|tues on which con&s;cience congratulates us, is a tribute that we can at any time exact with confidence, but the celebration of tho&s;e which we only feign, or de&s;ire without any vigo|rous endeavours to attain them, is received as a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;overeignty over regions that we never conquered, as a favourable deci&s;ion of di&s;putable claims, and is more welcome as it is more gratuitous.</P>
<P>ADVICE is generally offen&s;ive, not becau&s;e it lays us open to unexpected regret, or con|victs us of any fault which had e&s;caped our notice, but becau&s;e it &s;hows us that we are known to others as well as to our&s;elves, that our artifices of hypocri&s;y have been detected, or that the fear of our re&s;entment has lo&s;t its influence; and the officious monitor is per&s;e|cuted with hatred, not becau&s;e his accu&s;ation is con&s;idered as fal&s;e, but becau&s;e he a&s;&s;umes that &s;uperiority which we are not willing to
<PB N="165" REF="166">
grant him, and has dared to detect what we de&s;ired to conceal.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on advice is commonly inef|fectual. If tho&s;e who follow the call of their de&s;ires, without enquiry whither they are go|ing, had deviated ignorantly from the paths of wi&s;dom, and were ru&s;hing upon dangers unfore&s;een, they would readily li&s;ten to in|formation that recals them from their errors, and catch the fir&s;t alarm by which de&s;truction or infamy is denounced. Few that wander in the wrong way mi&s;take it for the right; they only find it more &s;mooth and flowery, and indulge their own choice rather than ap|prove it, therefore few are per&s;uaded to quit it by admonition or reproof, &s;ince it im|pre&s;&s;es no new conviction nor confers any powers of action or re&s;i&s;tance. He that is gravely informed how &s;oon profu&s;ion will an|nihilate his fortune, hears with little advan|tage what he knew before, and catches at the next occa&s;ion of expence, becau&s;e ad|vice has no force to &s;uppre&s;s his vanity. He that is told how certainly intemperance will hurry him to the grave, runs with his u&s;ual &s;peed to a new cour&s;e of luxury, becau&s;e his
<PB N="166" REF="167">
rea&s;on is not invigorated, nor his appetite weakened.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;chief of flattery is that of &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing the influence of hone&s;t ambition, by an opinion that honour may be gained without the toil of merit; and the benefit of advice ari&s;es commonly from the di&s;covery which it affords of the publick &s;uffrages. He that could with&s;tand con&s;cience, is frighted at in|famy, and &s;hame prevails when rea&s;on was defeated.</P>
<P>AS we all know our own faults, and know them generally with many aggravations which human per&s;picacity cannot di&s;cover, there is, perhaps, no man, however hardened by im|pudence or di&s;&s;ipated by levity, &s;heltered by hypocri&s;y, or bla&s;ted by di&s;grace, who does not intend &s;ome time to review his conduct, and to regulate the remainder of his life by the laws of virtue. New temptations indeed attack him, new invitations are of|fered by plea&s;ure and intere&s;t, and the hour of reformation is always delayed; every delay gives vice another opportunity of fortifying it&s;elf by habit; and the change of
<PB N="167" REF="168">
manners, though &s;incerely intended and rati|onally planned, is referred to the time when &s;ome craving pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall be fully gratified, or &s;ome powerful allurement cea&s;e its impor|tunity.</P>
<P>THUS procra&s;tination is accumulated on procra&s;tination, and one impediment &s;ucceeds another, till age &s;hatters our re&s;olution, or death intercepts the project of amendment. Such is often the end of &s;alutary purpo|&s;es, after they have long delighted the ima|gination, and appea&s;ed that di&s;quiet which every mind feels from known mi&s;conduct, when the attention is not diverted by bu&s;ine&s;s or by plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;urely can be more unworthy of a rea&s;onable nature, than to continue in a &s;tate &s;o oppo&s;ite to real happine&s;s, as that all the peace of &s;olitude, and felicity of medita|tion, mu&s;t ari&s;e from re&s;olutions of for&s;a|king it. Yet the world will often afford opportunities of ob&s;erving men, who pa&s;s months and years in a continual war with their own convictions, and are daily drag|ged by habit or betrayed by pa&s;&s;ion into
<PB N="168" REF="169">
practices, which they clo&s;ed and opened their eyes with purpo&s;es to avoid; purpo&s;es to avoid; purpo&s;es which though &s;ettled on conviction, the fir&s;t im|pul&s;e of momentary de&s;ire totally overthrows.</P>
<P>THE influence of cu&s;tom is indeed &s;uch that to conquer it will require the utmo&s;t ef|forts of fortitude and virtue, nor can I think any man more worthy of veneration and re|nown, than tho&s;e who have bur&s;t the &s;hac|kles of habitual vice. This victory is more heroick as the objects of guilty gratification are more familiar, and the recurrence of &s;oli|citation more frequent. He that from expe|rience of the folly of ambition re&s;igns his offices of power, &s;ets him&s;elf free at once from temptation to &s;quander his life in courts, becau&s;e he cannot regain his former &s;tation. He who is en&s;laved by an amorous pa&s;&s;ion, may quit his tyrant in di&s;gu&s;t, and ab&s;ence will without the help of rea&s;on overcome by degrees the de&s;ire of returning. But tho&s;e appetites to which every place affords their proper object, and which require no pre|paratory mea&s;ures or gradual advances, are more tenaciou&s;ly adhe&s;ive; the wi&s;h is &s;o near the enjoyment, that compliance often
<PB N="169" REF="170">
precedes con&s;ideration, and before the pow|ers of rea&s;on can be &s;ummoned the time for employing them is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>INDOLENCE is therefore one of the vices from which tho&s;e whom it once infects are &s;eldom reformed. Every other &s;pecies of luxury operates upon &s;ome appetite that is quickly &s;atiated, and requires &s;ome concur|rence of art or accident which every place will not &s;upply; but the de&s;ire of ea&s;e acts e|qually at all hours, and the longer it is in|dulged is the more encrea&s;ed. To do nothing is in every man's power; we can never want an opportunity of omitting duties. The lap&s;e to indolence is &s;oft and imperceptible, becau&s;e it is only a mere ce&s;&s;ation of activity, but the return to diligence is difficult, becau&s;e it implies a change from re&s;t to motion, from privation to reality. <Q><L>Facilis de&s;cen&s;us Averni:</L>
<L>Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis:</L>
<L>Sed revocare gradum, &s;upera&s;que evadere ad auras,</L>
<L>Hoc opus, hic labor e&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT might perhaps be u&s;eful to the conque&s;t of all the&s;e en&s;narers of the mind if at cer|tain
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;tated days life was reviewed. Ma|ny things nece&s;&s;ary are omitted, becau&s;e we vainly imagine that they may be always per|formed, and what cannot be done without pain will for ever be delayed if the time of doing it be left un&s;ettled. No corruption is great but by long negligence, which can &s;carcely prevail in a mind regularly and fre|quently awakened by periodical remor&s;e. He that thus breaks his life into parts, will find in him&s;elf a de&s;ire to di&s;tingui&s;h every &s;tage of his exi&s;tence by &s;ome improvement, and delight him&s;elf with the approach of the day of recollection, as of the time which is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a new &s;eries of virtue and felicity.</P>

<P>EVERY government, &s;ay the politicians, is perpetually degenerating towards cor|ruption, from which it mu&s;t be re&s;cued at certain periods by the re&s;u&s;citation of its fir&s;t principles, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of its o|riginal con&s;titution. Every animal body, ac|cording
<PB N="171" REF="172">
to the methodick phy&s;icians, is by the predominance of &s;ome exuberant quality continually declining towards di&s;ea&s;e and death, which mu&s;t be obviated by a &s;ea&s;ona|ble reduction of the peccant humour to the ju&s;t equipoi&s;e which health requires.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner the &s;tudies of man|kind, all at lea&s;t which not being &s;ubject to rigorous demon&s;tration admit the influence of fancy and caprice, are perpetually tending to error and confu&s;ion. Of the great princi|ples of truth which the fir&s;t &s;peculati&s;ts di&s;co|vered, the &s;implicity is embarra&s;&s;ed by ambi|tious additions, or the evidence ob&s;cured by inaccurate argumentation; and as they de+&s;cend from one &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of writers to ano+ther, like light tran&s;mitted from room to room, they lo&s;e their &s;trength and &s;plen+dor, and fade at la&s;t in total evane&s;cence.</P>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tems of learning therefore mu&s;t be &s;ometimes reviewed, complications anali&s;ed into principles, and knowledge di&s;entangled from opinion. It is not always po&s;&s;ible, with|out a clo&s;e in&s;pection, to &s;eparate the genuine &s;hoots of con&s;equential rea&s;oning, which
<PB N="172" REF="173">
grow out of &s;ome radical po&s;tulate, from the branches which art has engrafted on it. The accidental pre&s;criptions of authority, when time has procured them veneration, are often confounded with the laws of nature, and tho&s;e rules are &s;uppo&s;ed coeval with rea&s;on, of which the fir&s;t ri&s;e cannot be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>CRITICISM has &s;ometimes permitted fancy to dictate the laws by which fancy ought to be re&s;trained, and fallacy to perplex the prin|ciples by which fallacy is to be detected, her &s;uperintendance of others has betray|ed her to negligence of her&s;elf; and like the antient <HI>Scythians,</HI> by extending her con|que&s;ts over di&s;tant regions, &s;he has lo&s;t her throne vacant to her &s;laves.</P>
<P>AMONG the laws which the de&s;ire of extending authority, or ardour of promo|ting knowledge, has prompted men of diffe|rent abilities to pre&s;cribe, all which writers have received, had not the &s;ame original right to our regard. Some are to be con&s;idered as fundamental and indi&s;pen&s;able, others only as u&s;eful and convenient; &s;ome as dictated by rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity, others as enacted by de&s;|potick
<PB N="173" REF="174">
antiquity; &s;ome as invincibly &s;upport|ed by their conformity to the order of na|ture and operations of the intellect; others as formed by accident, or in&s;tituted by ex|ample, and therefore always liable to di&s;|pute and alteration.</P>
<P>THAT many rules have been advanced without con&s;ulting nature or rea&s;on, we can|not but &s;u&s;pect, when we find it perempto|rily decreed by the antient ma&s;ters, that <HI>only three &s;peaking per&s;onages &s;hould appear at once upon the &s;tage,</HI> a law which, as the variety and intricacy of modern plays has made it impo&s;|&s;ible to be ob&s;erved, we now violate without &s;cruple, and as experience proves without inconvenience.</P>
<P>THE original of this precept was merely accidental. Tragedy was a monody or toli|tary &s;ong in honour of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> improved af|terwards into a dialogue by the addition of another &s;peaker; but the antients remember|ing that the tragedy was at fir&s;t pronounced only by one, dur&s;t not for &s;ome time venture beyond two; at la&s;t when cu&s;tom and impu|nity had made them daring, they extended
<PB N="174" REF="175">
their liberty to the admi&s;&s;ion of three, but re|&s;trained them&s;elves by a critical edict from further exorbitance.</P>
<P>BY what accident the number of acts was limited to five, I know not that any author has informed us; but certainly it is not de|termined by any nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;ing either from the nature of action or propriety of exhi|bition. An act is only the repre&s;entation of &s;uch a part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the play as pro|ceeds in an unbroken tenor, or without any intermediate pau&s;e. Nothing is more evi|dent than that of every real, and by con&s;e|quence of every dramatick action, the inter|vals may be more or fewer than five; and in|deed the rule is upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tage every day broken in effect, without any other mi&s;|chief than that which ari&s;es from an ab&s;urd endeavour to ob&s;erve it in appearance. When the &s;eene is &s;hifted the act cea&s;es, &s;ince &s;ome time is nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed to elap&s;e while the per&s;onages of the drama change their place.</P>
<P>WITH no greater right to our obedience have the criticks confined the dramatic ac|tion
<PB N="175" REF="176">
to a certain number of hours. proba|bility requires that the time of action &s;hould approach &s;omewhat nearly to that of exhibition, and tho&s;e plays will always be thought mo&s;t happily conducted which croud the greate&s;t variety into the lea&s;t &s;pace. But &s;ince it will frequently happen that &s;ome de|lu&s;ion mu&s;t be admitted, I know not where the limits of imagination can be fixed. It is rarely ob&s;erved that minds not propo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by mechanical critici&s;m feel any offence from the exten&s;ion of the intervals between the acts; not can I conceive it ab&s;urd or im|po&s;&s;ible, that he who can multiply three hour, into twelve or twenty-four, might image with equal ea&s;e a greater number.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether he that profe&s;&s;es to regard no other laws than tho&s;e of nature, will not be inclined to receive tragi-comedy to his protection, whom, however generally condemned, her own laurels have hitherto &s;haded from the &s;ulminations of critici&s;m. For what is there in the mingled drama which impartial rea&s;on can condemn? the connex|on of important with trivial incidents, &s;ince it is not only common but perpetual in the
<PB N="176" REF="177">
world, may &s;urely be allowed upon the &s;tage, which pretends only to be the mirrour of life. The impropriety of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;i|ons before we have rai&s;ed them to the inten|ded agitation, and of diverting the expecta|tion from an event which we keep &s;u&s;pended only to rai&s;e it, may be &s;peciou&s;ly urged. But will not experience &s;hew this objection to be rather &s;ubtle than ju&s;t? is it not cer|tain that the tragic and comic affections have been moved alternately with equal force, and that no plays have oftner filled the eye with tears and the brea&s;t with palpitation, than tho&s;e which are variegated with inter|ludes of mirth?</P>
<P>I DO not however think it &s;afe to judge of works of genius merely by the event. The&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s vici&s;&s;itudes of the heart, this alternate prevalence of merriment and &s;olem|nity may &s;ometimes be more properly a&s;|cribed to the vigour of the writer than the ju&s;tne&s;s of the de&s;ign: And in&s;tead of vin|dicating tragi-comedy by the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Shake|&s;pear,</HI> we ought perhaps to pay new honours to that tran&s;cendent and unbounded genius that could pre&s;ide over the pa&s;&s;ions in &s;port;
<PB N="177" REF="178">
who to actuate the affections, needed not the &s;low gradation of common means, but could fill the heart with in&s;tantaneous jollity or &s;orrow, and vary our di&s;po&s;ition as he chang|ed his &s;cenes. Perhaps the effects even of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s poetry might have been yet great|er, had he not counter-acted him&s;elf; and we might have been more intere&s;ted in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his heroes had we not been &s;o frequently diverted by the jokes of his buf|foons.</P>
<P>THERE are other rules more fixed and ob|ligatory. It is nece&s;&s;ary that of every play the chief action &s;hould be &s;ingle; for &s;ince a play repre&s;ents &s;ome tran&s;action, through its regular maturation to its final event, two actions equally important mu&s;t evidently con|&s;titute two plays.</P>
<P>AS the de&s;ign of tragedy is to in&s;truct by moving the pa&s;&s;ions, it mu&s;t always have a hero, a per&s;onage apparently and inconte&s;ta|bly &s;uperior to the re&s;t, upon whom the at|tention may be fixed and the anxiety &s;u&s;|pended. For though if two per&s;ons oppo|&s;ing each other with equal abilities and equal
<PB N="178" REF="179">
virtue, the auditor will inevitably in time choo&s;e his favourite, yet as that choice mu&s;t be without any cogency of conviction, the hopes or fears which it rai&s;es will be faint and languid. Of two heroes acting in con|federacy again&s;t a common enemy, the vir|tues or dangers will give little emotion, be|cau&s;e each claims our concern with the &s;ame right, and the heart lies at re&s;t between equal motives.</P>
<P>IT ought to be the fir&s;t endeavour of a writer to di&s;tingui&s;h nature from cu&s;tom, or that which is e&s;tabli&s;hed becau&s;e it is right, from that which is right only becau&s;e it is e&s;tabli&s;hed; that he may neither violate e&s;|&s;ential principles by a de&s;ire of novelty, nor debar him&s;elf from the attainment of beau|ties within his view by a needle&s;s fear of breaking rules which no literary dictator had authority to enact.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH one of your corre&s;pondents has pre&s;umed to mention with &s;ome contempt that pre&s;ence of attention and ea|&s;ine&s;s of addre&s;s, which the polite have long agreed to celebrate and e&s;teem, yet I cannot be per&s;uaded to think them unworthy of re|gard or cultivation; but am inclined to be|lieve that, as we &s;eldom value rightly what we have never known the mi&s;ery of wanting, his judgment has been vitiated by his happi|ne&s;s; and that a natural exuberance of a&s;&s;u|rance has hindered him from di&s;covering its excellence and u&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS felicity, whether be&s;towed by con|&s;titution, or obtained by early habitudes, I can &s;carcely contemplate without envy. I was bred under a man of learning in the country, who having little acquaintance with
<PB N="180" REF="181">
grandeur or plea&s;ure, inculcated nothing but the dignity of knowledge, and the happi|ne&s;s of virtue. By frequency of admonition, and confidence of a&s;&s;ertion, he prevailed up|on me to believe, that at my fir&s;t entrance into the world, the &s;plendor of literature would be &s;ufficient to attract reverence, if it was not darkened by corruption. I there|fore pur&s;ued my &s;tudies with ince&s;&s;ant in|du&s;try, and avoided every thing which I had been taught to con&s;ider either as vicious or tending to vice, becau&s;e I regarded guilt and reproach as in&s;eparably united, and thought a tainted reputation the greate&s;t calamity.</P>
<P>AT the univer&s;ity, I found no rea&s;on for changing my opinion, for though many a|mong my fellow &s;tudents took the opportu|nity of a more remi&s;s di&s;cipline to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions; yet virtue pre&s;erved her na|tural &s;uperiority, and tho&s;e who ventured to neglect were not &s;uffered to in&s;ult her. The ambition of petty accompli&s;hments found its way into the receptacles of learning, but was ob&s;erved to &s;eize commonly on tho&s;e who either neglected the &s;ciences or could not attain them; and I was therefore confirm|ed
<PB N="181" REF="182">
in the doctrines of my old ma&s;ter, and thought nothing worthy of my care but the means of gaining or imparting knowledge.</P>
<P>THIS purity of manners, and inten&s;ene&s;s of application &s;oon extended my renown beyond my own college, and I was applauded by tho&s;e, who&s;e opinion I then thought un|likely to deceive me, as a young man that gave uncommon hopes of future eminence. My performances in time reached my native province, and my relations congratulated them&s;elves upon the new honours that were added to their family.</P>
<P>I RETURNED home covered with aca|demical laurels, and fraught with critici&s;m and philo&s;ophy. The wit and the &s;cholar excited curio&s;ity, and my acquaintance was &s;olicited by innumerable invitations. To plea&s;e will always be the wi&s;h of benevo|lence, to be admired mu&s;t be the con&s;tant aim of ambition; and I therefore con&s;idered my&s;elf as about to receive the reward of my hone&s;t labours, and to find the efficacy or learning and of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">
THE third day after my arrival I dined at the hou&s;e of a gentleman who had &s;ummon|ed a multitude of his friends to the annual celebration of his wedding-day. I &s;et for|ward with great exultation, and thought my|&s;elf happy, that I had an opportunity of di&s;|playing my knowledge to &s;o numerous an a&s;|&s;embly. I felt no &s;en&s;e of my own in&s;uffici|ency, till going up &s;tairs to the dining-room, I heard the mingled roar of ob&s;trererous mer|riment. I was however di&s;gu&s;ted rather than terrified, and went forward with|out dejection. The whole company ro&s;e at my entrance, but when I &s;aw &s;o ma|ny eyes fixed at once upon me, I was bla&s;ted with a &s;udden imbecility, I was quel|led by &s;ome namele&s;s power which I found impo&s;&s;ible to be re&s;i&s;ted. My &s;ight was daz|zled, my cheeks glowed, my perceptions were confounded; I was harra&s;&s;ed by the multitude of eager &s;alutations, and returned the common civilities with he&s;itation and impropriety; the &s;en&s;e of my own blunders encrea&s;ed my confu&s;ion, and before the ex|change of ceremonies allowed me to &s;it down, I was ready to &s;ink under the oppre&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="183" REF="184">
&s;urpri&s;e; my voice grew weak, and my knees trembled.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;embly then re&s;umed their places, and I &s;at with my eyes fixed upon the ground. To the que&s;tions of curio&s;ity, or the appeals of complai&s;ance, I could &s;eldom an&s;wer but with negative mono&s;yllables, or profe&s;&s;ions of ignorance; for the &s;ubjects on which they conver&s;ed, were &s;uch as are &s;eldom di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in books, and were therefore out of my range of knowledge. At length an old clergy man, who rightly conjectured the rea&s;on of my conci&s;ene&s;s, relieved me by &s;ome que&s;tions about the pre&s;ent &s;tate of natural knowledge, and engaged me by an appearance of doubt and oppo&s;ition in the explication and defence of the <HI>Newtonian</HI> philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own abilities rou&s;ed me from my depre&s;&s;ion, and long fa|miliarity with my &s;ubject enabled me to di&s;|cour&s;e with ea&s;e and volubility; but however I might plea&s;e my&s;elf, I found very little ad|ded by my demon&s;trations to the &s;atisfaction of the company; and my antagoni&s;t who knew the laws of conver&s;ation too well, to

detain their attention long upon an unplea|&s;ing topic, after he had commended my acutene&s;s and comprehen&s;ion, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the controver&s;y, and re&s;igned me to my former in&s;ignificance and perplexity.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner, I received from the ladies, who had heard that I was a wit, an invita|tion to the tea-table. I congratulated my&s;elf upon an opportunity to e&s;cape from the com|pany, who&s;e gaiety began to be tumultuous, and among whom &s;everal hints had been dropped of the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of univer&s;ities, the folly of book-learning, and the aukwardne&s;s of &s;cholars. To the ladies therefore I flew, as to a refuge from clamour, in&s;ult and ru&s;ti|city, but found my heart &s;ink as I approach|ed their apartment, and was again di&s;con|certed by the ceremonies of entrance, and confounded by the nece&s;&s;ity of encountering &s;o many eyes at once.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;at down I con&s;idered that &s;ome|thing pretty was always &s;aid to ladies, and re&s;olved to recover my credit by &s;ome elegant ob&s;ervation or graceful compliment. I applied my&s;elf to the recollection of all
<PB N="185" REF="186">
that I had read or heard in prai&s;e of beauty, and endeavoured to accommodate &s;ome cla&s;&s;i|cal compliment to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. I &s;unk into profound meditation, revolved the characters of the heroines of old, con&s;idered whatever the poets have &s;ung in their prai&s;e, and after having borrowed and invented, cho&s;en and rejected a thou&s;and &s;entiments, which, if I had uttered them, would not have been under&s;tood, I was awakened from my dream of learned gallantry, by the &s;er|vant who di&s;tributed the tea.</P>
<P>THERE are not many &s;ituations more in|ce&s;&s;antly unea&s;y than that in which the man is placed who is watching an opportunity to &s;peak, without courage to take it when it is offered, and who, tho' he re&s;olves to give a &s;pecimen of his abilities, always finds &s;ome rea&s;on or other for delaying it to the next minute. I was a&s;hamed of &s;ilence, yet could find nothing to &s;ay of elegance or importance equal to my wi&s;hes. The ladies, afraid of my learning, thought them&s;elves not quali|fied to propo&s;e any &s;ubject of prattle to a man &s;o famous for di&s;pute, and there was no|thing on either &s;ide but impatience and vex|ation.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
IN this conflict of &s;hame as I was rea&s;&s;em|bling my &s;cattered &s;entiments, and re&s;olving to force my imagination to &s;ome &s;prightly &s;ally, had ju&s;t found a very happy compli|ment, by too much attention to my own meditations, I &s;uffered the &s;aucer to drop from my hand. The cup was broken, the lap-dog was &s;calded, a brocaded petticoat was &s;tained, and the whole a&s;&s;embly was thrown into di&s;order. I now con&s;idered all hopes of reputation as at an end, and while they were con&s;oling and a&s;&s;i&s;ting one ano|ther, &s;tole away in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;adventures of this unhappy day are not yet at an end; I am afraid of meeting the meane&s;t of them that triumphed over me in this &s;tate of &s;tupidity and contempt, and feel the &s;ame terrors encroaching upon my heart at the &s;ight of tho&s;e who have once im|pre&s;&s;ed them. Shame, above any other pa&s;&s;i|on, propagates it&s;elf. Before tho&s;e who have &s;een me confu&s;ed, I can never appear with|out new confu&s;ion, and the remembrance of the weakne&s;s which I formerly di&s;covered, hinders me from acting or &s;peaking with my natural force.</P>

<P>CRITICISM, though dignified from the earlie&s;t ages by the labours of men eminent for knowledge and &s;agacity, and, &s;ince the revival of polite literature, the fa|vourite &s;tudy of <HI>European</HI> &s;cholars, has not yet attained the certainty and &s;tability of &s;ci|ence. The rules hitherto received, are &s;el|dom drawn from any &s;ettled principle or &s;elf-evident po&s;tulate, or adapted to the na|tural and invariable con&s;titution of things; but will be found upon examination the ar|bitrary edicts of legi&s;lators authori&s;ed only by them&s;elves, who out of various means by which the &s;ame end may be attained, &s;elected &s;uch as happened to occur to their own re|flection, and then by a law which idlene&s;s and timidity were too willing to obey, prohibi|ted new experiments of wit, re&s;trained fancy from the indulgence of her innate inclina|tion to hazard and adventure, and condemn|ed all future flights of genius to pur&s;ue the path of the <HI>Meonian</HI> eagle.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">
THE authority claimed by criticks may be more ju&s;tly oppo&s;ed, as it is apparently de|rived from them whom they endeavour to controul; for we owe few of the rules of writing to the acutene&s;s of tho&s;e by whom they are delivered, nor have they generally any other merit than that having read the works of great authors with attention, they have ob&s;erved the arrangement of their matter, or the graces of their expre&s;&s;ion, and then expected honour and reverence for precepts which they never could have invented: So that practice has introduced rules, rather than rules have directed practice.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on the laws of every &s;pecies of writing have been &s;ettled by the ideas of him who fir&s;t rai&s;ed it to reputation, with|out enquiry whether his performances were not yet &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement. The ex|cellencies and faults of celebrated writers have been equally recommended to po&s;terity; and &s;o far has blind reverence prevailed, that even the number of their books has been thought worthy of imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
THE imagination of the fir&s;t authors of lyrick poetry was vehement and rapid, and their knowledge various and exten&s;ive; living in an age when &s;cience had been little culti|vated, and when the minds of their auditors not being accu&s;tomed to accurate in&s;pection, were ea&s;ily dazzled by glaring ideas, they ap|plied them&s;elves to in&s;truct, rather by &s;hort &s;entences and &s;triking thoughts than by re|gular argumentation; and finding attention more &s;ucce&s;sfully excited by &s;udden &s;allies and unexpected exclamations, than by the more artful and placid beauties of methodical deduction, they loo&s;ed their genius to its own cour&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed from one &s;entiment to another without expre&s;&s;ing the intermediate ideas, and roved at large over the ideal world with &s;uch lightne&s;s and agility that their foot&s;teps are &s;carcely to be traced.</P>
<P>FROM this accidental peculiarity of the an|tient writers the criticks deduce the rules of lyrick poetry, which they have &s;et free from all the laws by which other compo&s;i|tions are confined, and allow to neglect the niceties of tran&s;ition, to &s;tart into remote di|gre&s;&s;ions, and to wander without re&s;traint from one &s;cene of imagery to another.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">
A WRITER of later times has by the viva|city of his e&s;&s;ays, reconciled mankind to the &s;ame licentiou&s;ne&s;s in &s;hort di&s;&s;ertations; and he therefore who wants &s;kill to form a plan or diligence to pur&s;ue it, needs only entitle his performance an e&s;&s;ay, to acquire the right of heaping together the collections of half his life, without order, coherence, or propriety.</P>
<P>IN writing, as in life, faults are endured without di&s;gu&s;t when they are a&s;&s;ociated with tran&s;cendent merit, and may be &s;ometimes recommended to weak judgments by the lu&s;tre which they obtain from their union with ex|cellence; but it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who pre&s;ume to &s;uperintend the ta&s;te or morals of mankind, to &s;eparate illu&s;ive combinations, and di&s;tingui&s;h that which may be prai&s;ed from that which can only be excu&s;ed. As vi|ces never promote happine&s;s, though when overpowered by more active and more nu|merous virtues they cannot totally de&s;troy it; &s;o confu&s;ion and irregularity produce no beau|ty, though they cannot always ob&s;truct the brightne&s;s of genius and learning. To pro|ceed from one truth to another, and connect
<PB N="192" REF="193">
di&s;tant propo&s;itions by regular con&s;equences is the great prerogative of man. Indepen|dent and unconnected &s;entiments fla&s;hing up|on the mind in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion may for a time delight by their novelty, but they differ from &s;y&s;tematical rea&s;oning, as &s;ingle notes from harmony, as glances of lightening from the radiance of the &s;un.</P>
<P>WHEN rules are thus drawn, rather from precedents than rea&s;on, there is danger not only from the faults of an author but from the errors of tho&s;e who critici&s;e his works; &s;ince they may often mi&s;lead their pupils by fal&s;e repre&s;entations as the <HI>Ciceronians</HI> of the &s;ixteenth century were betrayed into bar|bari&s;ms by corrupt copies of their darling writer.</P>
<P>IT is e&s;tabli&s;hed at pre&s;ent, that the proemial lines of a poem, in which the general &s;ubject is propo&s;ed, mu&s;t always be void of glitter and embelli&s;hment. "The fir&s;t lines of <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI>" &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> "are perhaps as plain, &s;imple and unadorned as any of the whole poem, in which particular the author has conformed him&s;elf to the ex|ample

Had <HI>Horace</HI> been con&s;ult|ed, he would have been found to direct only what &s;hould be compri&s;ed in the propo|&s;ition, not how it &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed, and to have commended <HI>Homer</HI> in oppo&s;ition to a meaner poet, not for the gradual elevation of his diction, but the judicious expan&s;ion of his plan, for di&s;pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing impromi&s;ed events, not for producing unexpected elegancies. <Q><L>&mdash;Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> miracula p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">it</L>

<P>IF the exordial lines of <HI>Homer</HI> be compa|red with the re&s;t of the poem, they will not appear remarkable for plainne&s;s or &s;implici|ty, but rather eminently adorned and illumi|nated. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines">

<P>THE imbecillity with which <HI>Verecundulus</HI> complains that the pre&s;ence of a nume|rous a&s;&s;embly freezes his faculties, is particu|larly incident to the &s;tudious part of mankind, who&s;e education nece&s;&s;arily &s;ecludes them in their earlier years from mingled conver&s;e, till at their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from &s;chools and acade|mies they plunge at once into the tumult of the world, and coming forth from the gloom of &s;olitude are overpowered by the blaze of publick life.</P>
<P>IT is perhaps kindly provided by nature that, as the feathers and &s;trength of a bird grow together, and her wings are not com|pleted
<PB N="196" REF="197">
till &s;he is able to fly, &s;o &s;ome propor|tion &s;hould be pre&s;erved in the human kind between judgment and courage; the precipi|tation of inexperience is therefore re&s;trained by &s;hame, and we remain &s;hackled by timi|dity, till we have learned to &s;peak and act with propriety.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE few can review the days of their youth, without recollecting tempta|tions, which &s;hame, rather than virtue, ena|bled them to re&s;i&s;t; and opinions which, however ha&s;tily conceived and negligently examined, however erroneous in their prin|ciples, and dangerous in their con&s;equences, they have a thou&s;and times panted to advance at the hazzard of contempt and hatred, when they found them&s;elves irre&s;i&s;tibly depre&s;&s;ed amid&s;t their eagerne&s;s and confidence, by a languid anxiety which &s;eized them at the mo|ment of utterance, and &s;till gathered &s;trength from their endeavours to re&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P>IT generally happens that a&s;&s;urance keeps an even pace with ability, and the fear of mi&s;carriage, which hinders our fir&s;t attempts, is gradually di&s;&s;ipated as our &s;kill advances
<PB N="197" REF="198">
towards certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. That ba&s;hful|ne&s;s therefore which prevents di&s;grace, that &s;hort and temporary &s;hame which &s;ecures us from the danger of la&s;ting reproach, cannot be properly counted among our misfortunes.</P>
<P>BASHFULNESS, however it may incom|mode for a moment, &s;carcely ever produces evils of long continuance; it may flu&s;h the cheek, flutter in the heart, deject the eyes, and enchain the tongue, but its mi&s;chiefs &s;oon pa&s;s off without remembrance. It may &s;ometimes exclude plea&s;ure, but &s;eldom opens any avenue to &s;orrow or remor&s;e. It is ob|&s;erved &s;omewhere, that <HI>few have repented of having forborn to &s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>TO excite oppo&s;ition and inflame male|volence is the unhappy privilege of courage made arrogant by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;trength. No man finds in him&s;elf any inclination to attack or oppo&s;e him who confe&s;&s;es his &s;upe|riority by blu&s;hing in his pre&s;ence. Quali|ties excited with apparent fearfulne&s;s, re|ceive applau&s;e from every voice, and &s;upport from every hand. Di&s;&s;idence may check re|&s;olution and ob&s;truct performance, but com|pen&s;ates
<PB N="198" REF="199">
its embarra&s;&s;ments by more impor|tant advantages, it conciliates the proud, and &s;oftens the &s;evere, averts envy from excel|lence, and cen&s;ure from mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>IT may indeed happen that knowledge and virtue remain too long congealed by this frigori&s;ick power, as the principles of vegeta|tion are &s;ometimes ob&s;tructed by lingering fro&s;ts. He that enters late into a publick &s;tation, though with all the abilities requi&s;ite to the di&s;charge of his duty, will find his pow|ers at fir&s;t impeded by a timidity which he him&s;elf knows to be vitious, and mu&s;t &s;truggle long again&s;t dejection and reluctance before he obtains the full command of his own attention, and adds the gracefulne&s;s of ea&s;e to the dignity of merit.</P>
<P>FOR this di&s;ea&s;e of the mind, I know not whether any remedies of much efficacy can be found. To advi&s;e a man unaccu&s;tomed to the eyes of multitudes to mount a tribunal without perturbation, to tell him who&s;e life has pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;hades of contemplation, that he mu&s;t not be di&s;concerted or perplexed in receiving and returning the compliments

It is to &s;uppo&s;e cu&s;tom in&s;tantaneou&s;ly controlable by rea&s;on, and to endeavour to communicate by pre|cept that which only time and habit can be|&s;tow.</P>
<P>HE that hopes by philo&s;ophy and contem|plation alone to fortify him&s;elf again&s;t that awe which all at their fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage of life, mu&s;t feel from the &s;pectators, will, at the hour of need, be mocked by his re&s;olution; and I doubt whether the pre&s;er|vatives which <HI>Plato</HI> relates <HI>Alcibiades</HI> to have received from <HI>Socrates,</HI> when he was about to &s;peak in publick, proved &s;ufficient to &s;ecure him from the powerful fa&s;cination.</P>
<P>YET as the effects of time may by art and indu&s;try be accelerated or retarded, it can|not be improper to con&s;ider by what motives to confidence and firmne&s;s this trouble&s;ome in&s;tinct may be oppo&s;ed when it exceeds its ju&s;t proportion, and in&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing pe|tulance

<P>No cau&s;e more frequently produces ba&s;h|fulne&s;s than too high an opinion of our own importance.

He con&s;iders, that what he &s;hall &s;ay or do will never be forgotten; that renown or infamy are &s;u&s;|penced upon every &s;yllable, and that no|thing ought to fall from him which will not bear the te&s;t of time.

<P>THE mo&s;t u&s;eful medicines are often u|plea&s;ing to the ta&s;te.

<P>THIS inconvenience ari&s;es in like man|ner from &s;truggles of the will again&s;t the un|der&s;tanding. It is not often difficult to find a &s;uitable companion if every man would be content with &s;uch as he is qualified to plea&s;e. But if vanity tempts him to for&s;ake his rank and po&s;t him&s;elf among tho&s;e with whom no common intere&s;t or mutual plea|&s;ure can ever unite him, he mu&s;t always live in a &s;tate of un&s;ocial &s;eparation, with|out tenderne&s;s and without tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE are many natures which can ne|ver approach within a certain di&s;tance, and which when any irregular motive impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> them towards contact, &s;eem to &s;tart back from each other by &s;ome invincible repul&s;ion. There are others which immediately cohere whenever they come into the reach of mu|tual attraction, and with very little forma|lity of preparation mingle intimately as &s;oon as they meet. Every man whom either bu|&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity has thrown at large into
<PB N="205" REF="206">
the world, will recollect many in&s;tances of fondne&s;s and di&s;like, which have forced them|&s;elves upon him without the intervention of his Judgment; of di&s;po&s;itions, to court &s;ome and avoid others, when he could a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for the preference, or none ade|quate to the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions; of in|fluence that acted in&s;tantaneou&s;ly upon his mind, and which no arguments or per&s;ua&s;i|ons could ever overcome.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e with whom time and inter|cour&s;e have made us familiar, we feel our affections divided in different proportions without much regard to moral or intellectu|al merit. Every man knows &s;ome whom he cannot induce him&s;elf to tru&s;t, though he has no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they would betray him; tho&s;e to whom he cannot com|plain though he never ob&s;erved them to want compa&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e in who&s;e pre&s;ence he ne|ver can be gay though excited by a thou&s;and invitations to mirth and freedom; and tho&s;e from whom he cannot be content to receive in&s;truction, though they never in&s;ul|ted his ignorance by contempt or o&s;tenta|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
THAT much regard is to be had to tho&s;e in&s;tincts of kindne&s;s and di&s;like, or that rea|&s;on &s;hould blindly follow them, I am far from intending to inculcate. It is very cer|tain that by indulgence we may give them &s;trength which they have not from nature, and almo&s;t every example of ingratitude and treachery proves that by obeying them we may commit our happine&s;s to tho&s;e who are very unworthy of &s;o great a tru&s;t. But it may de&s;erve to be remarked, that &s;ince few contend much with their inclinations, it is generally vain to &s;olicit the good will of tho&s;e whom we perceive thus involuntarily alienated from us; neither knowledge nor virtue will reconcile antipathy, and though officiou&s;ne&s;s may for a time be admitted, and diligence applauded, they will at la&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with coldne&s;s or di&s;couraged by neglect.</P>
<P>SOME have indeed an occult power of &s;tealing upon the affections, of exciting u|niver&s;al benevolence, and di&s;po&s;ing every heart to fondne&s;s and friend&s;hip. But this is a felicity granted only to the favourites of
<PB N="207" REF="208">
nature. The greater part of mankind find a different reception from different di&s;po&s;itions; they &s;ometimes obtain unexpected care&s;&s;es and di&s;tinctions from tho&s;e whom they never flattered with any uncommon regard, and &s;ometimes exhau&s;t all their arts of plea&s;ing without effect. To the&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to look round with vigilance, and attempt every brea&s;t in which they find virtue &s;ufficient for the foundation of friend&s;hip; to enter into the crowd and try whom chance will offer to their notice till they fix on &s;ome temper congenial to their own, as the magnet rolled in the du&s;t collects the fragments of its kindred metal from a thou&s;and particles of other &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>EVERY man mu&s;t have remarked the fa|cility with which the kindne&s;s of others is &s;ometimes gained by tho&s;e to whom he never could have imparted his own. We are by our occupations, education and habits of life divided almo&s;t into different &s;pecies, which regard one another for the mo&s;t part with &s;corn and malignity. Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of the human race has de&s;ires, fears, and conver&s;ation, vexations and merriment peculiar to it&s;elf; cares which another can|not feel; plea&s;ures which he cannot partake;
<PB N="208" REF="209">
and modes of expre&s;&s;ing every &s;en&s;ation which he cannot under&s;tand. That frolick which &s;hakes one man with laughter will convul&s;e another with indignation; the &s;train of jocularity which in one place obtains treats and patronage, would in another be heard with indifference, and in a third with ab|horrence.</P>
<P>TO rai&s;e e&s;teem we mu&s;t benefit others, to procure love we mu&s;t plea&s;e them. <HI>A|ri&s;totle,</HI> that great ma&s;ter of human nature ob&s;erves, that old men do not readily form friend&s;hips, becau&s;e they are not ea&s;ily &s;u&s;|ceptible of plea&s;ure. He that can contribute to the hilarity of the vacant hour, or par|take with equal gu&s;t the favourite amu&s;e|ment, he who&s;e mind is employed on the &s;ame objects, and who therefore never har|ra&s;&s;es the under&s;tanding with unaccu&s;tomed ideas, will be always welcomed with ardour, and left with regret, unle&s;s he de&s;troys tho&s;e advantages by faults with which peace and &s;ecurity cannot con&s;i&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. RAMBLER,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have formerly ob&s;erved that curio|&s;ity often terminates in barren know|ledge, and that the mind is prompted to &s;tu|dy and enquiry rather by the unea&s;ine&s;s of ig|norance, than the hope of profit. Nothing can be of le&s;s importance to any pre&s;ent in|tere&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="211">
than the fortune of tho&s;e who have been long lo&s;t in the grave, and from whom nothing now can be hoped or feared. Yet to rou&s;e the zeal of a true antiquary little more is nece&s;&s;ary than to mention a name which mankind have con&s;pired to forget; he will make his way to remote &s;eenes of action through ob&s;curity and contradiction, as <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ought amid&s;t bu&s;hes and brambles the tomb of <HI>Archimedes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover how it concerns him that gathers the produce or receives the rent of an e&s;tate, to know through what families the land has pa&s;&s;ed, who is regi&s;ter|ed in the conqueror's &s;urvey as its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, how often it has been forfeited by trea&s;on, or how often &s;old by prodigality. The pow|er or wealth of the pre&s;ent inhabitants of a country cannot be much encrea&s;ed by an enquiry after the names of tho&s;e barbarians, who de&s;troyed one another twenty centuries ago, in conte&s;ts for the &s;helter of woods or convenience of pa&s;turage. Yet we &s;ee that no man can be at re&s;t in the enjoyment of a new purcha&s;e till he has learned the hi&s;tory of his grounds from the antient inhabitants
<PB N="211" REF="212">
of the pari&s;h, and that no nation omits to record the actions of their ance&s;tors, howe|ver bloody, &s;avage and rapacious.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition as different opportuni|ties call it forth, di&s;covers it&s;elf in great or in little things. I have always thought it un|worthy of a wi&s;e man to &s;lumber in total inactivity only becau&s;e he happens to have no employment equal to his ambition or genius; it is therefore my cu&s;tom to apply my at|tention to the objects before me, and as I cannot think any place wholly unworthy of notice that affords a habitation to a man of letters, I have collected the hi&s;tory and an|tiquities of the &s;everal garrets in which I have re&s;ided. <Q>Quantulacunque e&s;tis, vos ego magna voco.</Q></P>
<P>MANY of the&s;e narratives my indu&s;try has been able to extend to a con&s;iderable length; but the woman with whom I now lodge has lived only eighteen months in the hou&s;e, and can give no account of its antient revo|lutions; the plai&s;terer having, at her en|trance, obliterated by his white-wa&s;h, all the
<PB N="212" REF="213">
&s;moky memorials which former tenants had left upon the cicling, and perhaps drawn the veil of oblivion over politicians, philo|&s;ophers and poets.</P>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t cheapened my lodgings, the landlady told me, that &s;he hoped I was not an author, for the lodgers on the fir&s;t floor had &s;tipulated that the upper rooms &s;hould not be occupied by a noi&s;y trade. I very readily promi&s;ed to give no di&s;turbance to her family, and &s;oon di&s;patched a bargain on the u&s;ual terms.</P>
<P>I HAD not &s;lept many nights in my new apartment before I began to enquire after my predece&s;&s;ors, and found my landlady, who&s;e imagination is filled chiefly with her own affairs, very ready to give me infor|mation.</P>
<P>CURIOSITY, like all other de&s;ires, pro|duces pain, as well as plea&s;ure. Before &s;he began her narrative, I had heated my head with expectations of adventures and di&s;co|veries, of elegance in di&s;gui&s;e and learning in di&s;tre&s;s, and was &s;omewhat mortified
<PB N="213" REF="214">
when I heard, that the fir&s;t tenant was a taylor, of whom nothing was remembred but that he complained of his room for want of light; and, after having lodged in it a month, and paid only a week's rent, pawned a piece of cloth which he was tru&s;ted to cut out, and was forced to make a precipitate retreat from this quarter of the town.</P>
<P>THE next was a young woman newly ar|rived from the country, who lived for five weeks with great regularity, and became by frequent treats very much the favourite of the family, but at la&s;t received vi&s;its &s;o fre|quently from a cou&s;in in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> that &s;he brought the reputation of the hou&s;e into danger, and was therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with good advice.</P>
<P>THE room then &s;tood empty for a fort|night; my landlady began to think that &s;he had judged hardly, and often wi&s;hed for &s;uch another lodger. At la&s;t an elderly man of a grave a&s;pect, read the bill, and bar|gained for the room, at the very fir&s;t price that was a&s;ked. He lived in clo&s;e retire|ment, &s;eldom went out till evening, and
<PB N="214" REF="215">
then returned early, &s;ometimes chearful, and at other times dejected. It was remarkable, that whatever he purcha&s;ed, he never had &s;mall money in his pocket, and though cool and temperate on other occa&s;ions, was al|ways vehement and &s;tormy till he received his change. He paid his rent with great ex|actne&s;s, and &s;eldom failed once a week to requite my landlady's civility with a &s;upper. At la&s;t, &s;uch is the fate of human felicity, the hou&s;e was alarmed at midnight by the con&s;table, who demanded to &s;earch the gar|rets. My landlady a&s;&s;uring him that he had mi&s;taken the door, conducted him up &s;tairs, where he found the tools of a coiner; but the tenant had crawled along the roof to an empty hou&s;e, and e&s;caped; much to the joy of my landlady, who declares him a very hone&s;t man, and wonders why any bo|dy &s;hould be hanged for making money when &s;uch numbers are in want of it. She howe|ver confe&s;ies that &s;he &s;hall for the future al|ways que&s;tion the character of tho&s;e who take her garret without beating down the price.</P>
<P>THE bill was then placed again in the window, and the poor woman was teazed
<PB N="215" REF="216">
for &s;even weeks by innumerable pa&s;&s;engers, who obliged her to climb with them every hour up five &s;tories, and then di&s;liked the pro&s;pect, hated the noi&s;e of a publick &s;treet, thought the &s;tairs narrow, objected to a low ceiling, required the walls to be hung with fre&s;her paper, a&s;ked que&s;tions about the neighbourhood, could not think of living &s;o far from their acquaintance, wi&s;hed the win|dow had looked to the &s;outh rather than the we&s;t, told how the door and chimney might have been better di&s;po&s;ed, bid her half the price that &s;he a&s;ked, or promi&s;ed to give her earne&s;t the next day, and came no more.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, a &s;hort meagre man, in a tarni&s;h|ed wai&s;tcoat, de&s;ired to &s;ee the garret, and when he had &s;tipulated for two long &s;helves and a larger table, hired it at a low rate. When the affair was compleated, he looked round him with great &s;atisfaction, and re|peated &s;ome words which the woman did not under&s;tand. In two days he brought a great box of books, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his room, and lived very inoffen&s;ively, except that he frequently di&s;turbed the inhabitants of the next floor by un&s;ea&s;onable noi&s;es. He was
<PB N="216" REF="217">
generally in bed at noon, but from evening to midnight he &s;ometimes talked aloud with great vehemence, &s;ometimes &s;tamped as in rage, &s;ometimes threw down his poker, then clattered his chairs, then &s;at down in deep thought, and again bur&s;t out into loud vo|ci&s;erations; &s;ometimes he would &s;igh as op|pre&s;&s;ed with mi&s;ery, and &s;ometimes &s;hake with convul&s;ive laughter. When he encoun|tered any of the family he gave way or bow|ed, but rarely &s;poke, except that as he went up &s;tairs he often repeated, <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 line"></Q> hard words, to which his neighbours li&s;tened &s;o often, that they learned them without un|der&s;tanding them. What was his employ|ment &s;he did not venture to a&s;k him, but at la&s;t heard a printer's boy enquire for the au|thor.</P>
<P>MY landlady was very often advi&s;ed to be|ware of this &s;trange man, who though he was quiet for the pre&s;ent, might perhaps become outrageous in the hot months; but as &s;he was punctually paid, &s;he could not find any &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="217" REF="218">
rea&s;on for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him, till one night he convinced her by &s;etting fire to his curtains, that it was not &s;afe to have an author for her inmate.</P>
<P>SHE had then for &s;ix weeks a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tenants, who left the hou&s;e on Saturday, and in&s;tead of paying their rent, &s;tormed at their landlady. At la&s;t &s;he took in two &s;i&s;ters, one of whom had &s;pent her little fortune in procuring remedies for a lingering di&s;ea&s;e, and was now &s;upported and attended by the other: &s;he climbed with difficulty to the apartment, where &s;he langui&s;hed eight weeks without impatience or lamentation, except for the expence and fatigue which her &s;i&s;ter &s;uffered, and then calmly and con|tentedly expired. The &s;i&s;ter followed her to the grave, paid the few debts which they had contracted, wiped away the tears of u&s;e|le&s;s &s;orrow, and returning to the bu&s;ine&s;s of common life, re&s;igned to me the vacant ha|bitation.</P>
<P>SUCH, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> are the changes which have happened in the narrow &s;pace
<PB N="218" REF="219">
where my pre&s;ent fortune has fixed my re|&s;idence. So true is it that amu&s;ement and in&s;truction are always at hand for tho&s;e who have &s;kill and willingne&s;s to find them; and &s;o ju&s;t is the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> that a &s;ingle hou&s;e will &s;hew whatever is done or &s;uffered in the world.</P>

<P>ONE of the complaints uttered by <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> in the angui&s;h of blind|ne&s;s, is, that he &s;hall pa&s;s his life under the direction of others; that he cannot regulate his conduct by his own knowledge, but mu&s;t lie at the mercy of tho&s;e who undertake to guide him.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;tate more contrary to the dignity of wi&s;dom than perpetual and unli|mited dependence, in which the under&s;tand|ing lies u&s;ele&s;s, and every motion is received from external impul&s;e. Rea&s;on is the great di&s;tinction of human nature, the faculty by which we approach to &s;ome degree of a&s;&s;o|ciation with cele&s;tial intelligences; but as the excellence of every power appears only
<PB N="220" REF="221">
in its operations, not to have rea&s;on, and to have it u&s;ele&s;s and unemployed, is nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>SUCH is the weakne&s;s of man that the e&s;|&s;ence of things is &s;eldom &s;o much regarded as external and accidental appendages. A &s;mall variation of trivial circum&s;tances, a &s;light change of form by an artificial dre&s;s, or a ca&s;ual difference of appearance by a new light and &s;ituation will conciliate affecti|on or excite abhorrence, and determine us to pur&s;ue or to avoid. Every man con&s;i|ders a nece&s;&s;ity of compliance with any will but his own, as the lowe&s;t &s;tate of igno|miny and meanne&s;s; few are &s;o far lo&s;t in cowardice or negligence as not to rou&s;e at the fir&s;t in&s;ult of tyranny, and exert all their force again&s;t him who u&s;urps their property, or invades any priviledge of &s;peech or acti|on. Yet we often &s;ee tho&s;e who never wanted &s;pirit to repel encroachment or op|po&s;e violence, at la&s;t by a gradual relaxation of vigilance, delivering up, without capitu|lation, the fortre&s;s which they defended a|gain&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and laying down unbidden the weapons which they gra&s;ped the harder
<PB N="221" REF="222">
for every attempt to wre&s;t them from their hands. Men eminent for &s;pirit and wi&s;|dom often re&s;ign them&s;elves to voluntary pupillage, and &s;uffer their lives to be mo|delled by officious ignorance, and their choice to be regulated by pre&s;umptuous &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>THIS unre&s;i&s;ting acquie&s;cence in the de|termination of others may be the con&s;e|quence of application to &s;ome &s;tudy remote from the beaten track of life, &s;ome employ|ment which does not allow lei&s;ure for &s;uffi|cient in&s;pection of tho&s;e petty affairs, by which nature has decreed a great part of our duration to be filled. To a mind thus withdrawn from common objects it is more eligible to repo&s;e on the prudence of another than to be expo&s;ed every moment to trivial inter|ruptions. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which &s;uch con|fidence requires is paid without pain, becau&s;e it implies no con&s;e&s;&s;ion of inferiority. The bu&s;ine&s;s from which we withdraw our cog|nizance, is not above our abilities, but be|low our notice. We plea&s;e our pride with the effects of our influence thus weakly ex|erted, and fancy our&s;elves placed in a higher orb, from which we regulate &s;ubordinate
<PB N="222" REF="223">
agents by a &s;light and di&s;tant &s;uperintendence. But, whatever vanity or ab&s;traction may &s;ug|ge&s;t, no man can &s;afely do that by others which might be done by him&s;elf; he that in|dulges negligence will quickly become igno|rant of his own affairs; and he that tru&s;ts without re&s;erve will at la&s;t be deceived.</P>
<P>IT is however impo&s;&s;ible, but that as the attention tends &s;trongly towards one thing it mu&s;t retire from another; and he that omits the care of dome&s;tick bu&s;ine&s;s becau&s;e he is engro&s;&s;ed by enquiries of more impor|tance to mankind, has at lea&s;t the merit of &s;uffering in a good cau&s;e. But there are ma|ny who can plead no &s;uch extenuation of their folly; who &s;hake off the burthen of their &s;tation, not that they may &s;oar with le&s;s encumbrance to the heights of knowledge or virtue, but that they may loiter at ea&s;e and &s;leep in quiet; and who &s;elect for friend|&s;hip and confidence not the faithful and the virtuous, but the &s;oft, the civil, and com|pliant.</P>
<P>THIS openne&s;s to flattery is the common di&s;grace of declining life. When men feel
<PB N="223" REF="224">
weakne&s;s encrea&s;ing on them, they naturally de&s;ire to re&s;t from the &s;truggles of contradic|tion, the fatigue of rea&s;oning, and the anxi|ety of circum&s;pection; when they are hourly tormented with pains and di&s;ea&s;es, they are unable to bear any new di&s;turbance, and con&s;ider all oppo&s;ition as an addition to mi&s;e|ry, of which they feel already more than they can patiently endure. Thus de&s;irous of peace, and thus fearful of pain, the old man &s;eldom enquires after any other qualities in tho&s;e whom he care&s;&s;es, than quickne&s;s in conjecturing his de&s;ires, activity in &s;upplying his wants, dexterity in intercepting com|plaints or remon&s;trances before they approach near enough to di&s;turb him, flexibility to his pre&s;ent humour, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to ha&s;ty petu|lance, and attention to weari&s;ome narrations. By the&s;e arts alone many have been able to defeat the claims of kindred and of merit, and to enrich them&s;elves with pre&s;ents and legacies.</P>
<P><HI>THRASYBULUS</HI> inherited a large fortune from his ance&s;tors, and augmented it by a marriage with an heire&s;s, and the revenues of &s;everal lucrative employments, which he
<PB N="224" REF="225">
di&s;charged with honour and dexterity. He was at la&s;t wi&s;e enough to con&s;ider, that life &s;hould not be devoted wholly to accumula|tion, and therefore re&s;igned his employments, and retiring to his e&s;tate, applied him&s;elf to the education of his children, and the culti|vation of dome&s;tick happine&s;s.</P>
<P>HE pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years in this plea&s;ing a|mu&s;ement, and &s;aw his care amply recompen&s;ed; his daughters were celebrated for mode&s;ty and elegance, and his &s;ons for learning, prudence and &s;pirit. In time the eagerne&s;s, with which the neighbouring gentlemen courted his alli|ance, obliged him to re&s;ign his daughters to other families; the vivacity and curio&s;ity of his &s;ons, hurried them out of rural privacy into the open world, from whence they had not &s;oon an inclination to return. This however was no more than he had always hoped; he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;chemes, and felt no inconvenience from &s;olitude till an apoplexy deprived him of his wife.</P>
<P><HI>THRASYBULUS</HI> had now no compa|nion; and the maladies of encrea&s;ing years
<PB N="225" REF="226">
having taken from him much of the power of procuring amu&s;ement for him&s;elf, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to procure &s;ome inferior friend, who might ea&s;e him of his economical &s;olici|tudes, and divert him by chearful conver&s;a|tion. He &s;oon recollected all the&s;e qualities in <HI>Vafer,</HI> a clerk in one of the offices over which he had formerly pre&s;ided. <HI>Vafer</HI> was invited to vi&s;it his old patron, and being by his &s;tation nece&s;&s;arily acquainted with the pre&s;ent modes of life, and by con&s;tant prac|tice dexterous in bu&s;ine&s;s, entertained him with &s;o many novelties, and &s;o readily di&s;en|tangled his affairs, that his pre&s;ence was thought the principal con&s;tituent of happi|ne&s;s; he was de&s;ired to re&s;ign his clerk&s;hip, and accept a liberal &s;alary in the hou&s;e of <HI>Thra&s;ybulus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VAFER</HI> having always lived in a &s;tate of dependance, was well ver&s;ed in the arts by which favour is obtained, and being long ac|cu&s;tomed to repre&s;s all &s;tarts of re&s;entment and &s;allies of confidence, could without re|pugnance or he&s;itation accommodate him&s;elf to every caprice, adopt every opinion, and echo every a&s;&s;ertion. He never doubted but
<PB N="226" REF="227">
to be convinced, nor attempted oppo&s;ition but to &s;latter <HI>Thra&s;ybulus</HI> with the opinion of a victory. By this practice he found his way quickly into the heart of his patron, and ha|ving fir&s;t made him&s;elf agreeable, &s;oon be|came important. His in&s;idious diligence by which the lazine&s;s of age was gratified, &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed the management of affairs; and his warm profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, petty offices of civility, and occa&s;ional interce&s;&s;ions, per&s;ua|ded the tenants to con&s;ider him as their friend and benefactor, to con&s;ult him in all their &s;chemes, and to entreat his enforcement of their repre&s;entations of hard years, and his countenance to petitions for abatement of rent.</P>
<P><HI>THRASYBULUS</HI> has now banquetted on flattery, till he could no longer bear the har&s;hne&s;s of remon&s;trance or the in&s;ipidity of truth. All contrariety to his own opinion &s;hocked him like a violation of &s;ome natural right, and all recommendation of his affairs to his own in&s;pection was dreaded by him as a &s;ummons to torture. His children were a|larmed by the &s;udden riches of <HI>Vafer,</HI> but their complaints were heard by their father
<PB N="227" REF="228">
with impatience, and their advice rejected with rage, as the re&s;ult of a con&s;piracy again&s;t his quiet, and a de&s;ign to condemn him for their own advantage to groan out his la&s;t hours in perplexity and drudgery. The daughters retired with tears in their eyes, but the &s;on continued his importunities till he found his inheritance hazarded by his ob&s;tinacy. <HI>Vafer</HI> having thus triumphed over all their efforts, and continuing to confirm him&s;elf in autho|rity and encrea&s;e his acqui&s;itions, at the death of his ma&s;ter purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate, and bad defiance to enquiry and ju&s;tice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM one of tho&s;e mortals who have been courted and envied as the favourites of the great. Having often gained the prize of compo&s;ition at the univer&s;ity, I began to hope that I &s;hould obtain the &s;ame di&s;tinction in every other place, and determin'd to for|&s;ake the profe&s;&s;ion to which I was de&s;tined by my parents, and in which the intere&s;t of my family would have procured me a very advantageous &s;ettlement. The pride of wit fluttered in my heart, and when I prepared to leave the college, nothing entered my ima|gination but honours, care&s;&s;es, and rewards, riches without labour, and luxury without expence.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">
I HOWEVER delayed my departure for a time to fini&s;h the performance by which I was to draw the fir&s;t notice of mankind up|on me. When it was compleated I hur|ried to <HI>London,</HI> and con&s;idered every mo|ment that pa&s;&s;ed before its publication, as lo&s;t in a kind of neutral exi&s;tence, and cut off from the golden hours of happine&s;s and fame. The piece was at la&s;t printed and di&s;|&s;eminated by a rapid &s;ale; I wandered from one place of concour&s;e to another, fea&s;ted from morning to night on the repetition of my own prai&s;es, and enjoyed the various conjectures of criticks, the mi&s;taken candour of my friends, and the impotent malice of my enemies. Some had read the manu&s;cript and rectified its inaccuracies; others had &s;een it in a &s;tate &s;o imperfect, that they could not forbear to wonder at its pre&s;ent excellence; &s;ome had conver&s;ed with the author at the coffee-hou&s;e; and others gave hints that they had lent him money.</P>
<P>I KNEW that no performance is &s;o favour|ably read as that of a writer who &s;uppre&s;&s;es his name, and therefore re&s;olved to remain
<PB N="233" REF="234">
concealed till tho&s;e by whom literary reputa|tion is e&s;tabli&s;hed had given their &s;uffrages too publickly to retract them. At length my book&s;eller informed me that <HI>Aurantius</HI> the &s;tanding patron of merit had &s;ent enqui|ries after me, and invited me to his acquain|tance.</P>
<P>THE time, which I had long expected, was now arrived. I went to <HI>Aurantius</HI> with a beating heart, for I looked upon our inter|view as the critical moment of my de&s;tiny. I was received with civilities, which my aca|demick rudene&s;s made me unable to repay, but, when I had recovered from my confu|&s;ion, I pro&s;ecuted the conver&s;ation with &s;uch liveline&s;s and propriety, that I confirmed my new friend in his e&s;teem of my abilities, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t ardour of pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and raptures of fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;oon &s;ummoned to dine with <HI>Au|rantius,</HI> who had a&s;&s;embled the mo&s;t judici|ous of his friends to partake of the entertain|ment. Again I exerted my powers of &s;enti|ment and expre&s;&s;ion, and again found every eye &s;parkling with delight, and every tongue
<PB N="234" REF="235">
&s;ilent with attention. I now became familiar at the table of <HI>Aurantius,</HI> but could never, in his mo&s;t private or jocund hours, obtain more from him than general declarations of e&s;teem or endearments of tenderne&s;s, which included no particular promi&s;e, and therefore conferred no claim. This frigid re&s;erve &s;ome|what di&s;gu&s;ted me, and when he complained of three days ab&s;ence, I took care to inform him with how much importunity of kindne&s;s I had been detained by his rival <HI>Pollio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AURANTIUS</HI> now con&s;idered his ho|nour as endangered by the de&s;ertion of a wit, and le&s;t I &s;hould have an inclination to wan|der, told me that I could never find a friend more con&s;tant or zealous than him&s;elf; that indeed he had made no promi&s;es, becau&s;e he hoped to &s;urpri&s;e me with advancement, but had been &s;ilently promoting my intere&s;t, and &s;hould continue his good offices, unle&s;s he found the kindne&s;s of others more de&s;ired.</P>
<P>IF you, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> have ever ventured your philo&s;ophy within the attraction of great|ne&s;s, you know the force of &s;uch language introduced with a &s;mile of gracious tenderne&s;s,
<PB N="235" REF="236">
and impre&s;&s;ed at the conclu&s;ion with an air of &s;olemn &s;incerity. From that in&s;tant I gave my&s;elf up wholly to <HI>Aurantius,</HI> and, as he immediately re&s;umed his former gaiety, expected every morning a &s;ummons to &s;ome employment of dignity and profit. One month &s;ucceeded another, and in defiance of appearances I &s;till fan&s;ied my&s;elf nearer to my wi&s;hes, and continued to dream of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and wake to di&s;appointment. At la&s;t the failure of my little fortune compelled me to abate the finery which I hitherto thought nece&s;&s;ary to the company with whom I a&s;&s;o|ciated, and the rank to which I &s;hould be rai&s;ed. <HI>Aurantius</HI> from the moment in which he di&s;covered my poverty, con&s;idered me as fully in his power, and afterwards rather per|mitted my attendance than invited it, thought him&s;elf at liberty to refu&s;e my vi&s;its whenever he had other amu&s;ements within reach, and often &s;uffered me to wait without pretending any nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s. When I was admit|ted to his table, if any man of rank equal to his own was pre&s;ent, he took occa&s;ion to mention my writings and commend my in|genuity, by which he intended to apologize for the confu&s;ion of di&s;tinctions, and the im|proper
<PB N="236" REF="237">
a&s;&s;ortment of his company; and often called upon me to entertain his friends with my productions, as a &s;port&s;man delights the &s;quires of his neighbourhood with the cur|vets of his hor&s;e, or the obedience of his &s;paniels.</P>
<P>TO compleat my mortification, it was his practice to impo&s;e ta&s;ks upon me, by requi|ring me to write upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as he thought &s;u&s;ceptible of ornament and illu&s;tra|tion. With the&s;e extorted performances he was little &s;atisfied, becau&s;e he rarely found in them the ideas which his own imagination had &s;ugge&s;ted, and which he therefore thought more natural than mine.</P>
<P>WHEN the pale of ceremony is broken, rude|ne&s;s and in&s;ult &s;oon enter at the breach. He now found that he might &s;afely harra&s;s me with vexation, that he had fixed the &s;hackles of patronage upon me, and that I could nei|ther re&s;i&s;t him nor e&s;cape. At la&s;t, in the eighth year of my &s;ervitude, when the clamour of creditors was vehement, and my nece&s;&s;ity known to be extreme, he offered me a &s;mall office, but hinted his expectations that I
<PB N="237" REF="238">
&s;hould marry a young woman with whom he had been acquainted.</P>
<P>I WAS not &s;o far depre&s;&s;ed by my calami|ties as to comply with his propo&s;al; but knowing that complaints and expo&s;tulations would but gratify his in&s;olence, I turned a|way with that contempt, with which I &s;hall never want &s;pirit to treat the wretch who can outgo the guilt of a robber without the temp|tation of his profit, and who lures the credu|lous and thoughtle&s;s to maintain the &s;how of his Levee, and the mirth of his table, at the expence of honour, happine&s;s, and life.

<P>PRAISE and di&s;tinction are &s;o plea&s;ing to the pride of man, that a great part of the pain and plea&s;ure of life ari&s;es from the
<PB N="238" REF="239">
gratification or di&s;appointment of this in|ce&s;&s;ant wi&s;h for &s;uperiority, from the &s;ucce&s;s or mi&s;carriage of &s;ecret competitions, from victories and defeats of which none are con|&s;cious except our&s;elves.</P>
<P>PROPORTIONATE to the prevalence of this love of prai&s;e is the variety of means by which its attainment is attempted. Every man, however hopele&s;s his preten&s;ions may appear to all but him&s;elf, has &s;ome project by which he hopes to ri&s;e to reputation; &s;ome art by which he imagines that the notice of the world will be attracted; &s;ome quality, good or bad, which di&s;criminates him from the common herd of mortals, and by which others may be per&s;uaded to love, or com|pelled to fear him. The a&s;cents of honour, however &s;teep, never appear inacce&s;&s;ible; he that de&s;pairs to &s;cale the precipices by which valour and learning have conducted their fa|vourites, di&s;covers &s;ome by-path, or ea&s;ier acclivity, which, though it cannot conduct him to the &s;ummit, will yet enable him to overlook tho&s;e with whom he is now con|tending for eminence; and we &s;eldom require more to the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent hour,
<PB N="239" REF="240">
than to &s;urpa&s;s him that &s;tands next before us.</P>
<P>AS the greater part of humankind &s;peak and act wholly by imitation, mo&s;t of tho&s;e who a&s;pire to honour and applau&s;e propo&s;e to them&s;elves &s;ome example which &s;erves as the model of their conduct, and the limit of their hopes. Almo&s;t every man if clo&s;ely examined, will be found to have enli&s;ted him&s;elf under &s;ome leader whom he expects to conduct him to renown; to have &s;ome hero or other, living or dead, perpetually in his view, who&s;e character he endeavours to a&s;&s;ume, and who&s;e performances he labours to equal.</P>
<P>WHEN the original is well cho&s;en and judiciou&s;ly copied, the imitator often arrives at excellence, which he could never have at|tained without direction; for few are formed with abilities to di&s;cover new po&s;&s;ibilities of excellence, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by means never tried before.</P>
<P>BUT it frequently happens that folly and idlene&s;s contrive to gratify pride at a cheaper
<PB N="240" REF="241">
rate; that not the qualities which are mo&s;t illu&s;trious, but tho&s;e which are of ea&s;ie&s;t at|tainment are &s;elected to be copied; and that the honours and rewards which public grati|tude has paid to the benefactors of mankind, are expected by wretches who can only imi|tate them in their vices and defects, or a|dopt &s;ome petty &s;ingularities of which tho&s;e from whom they are borrowed, were &s;ecretly a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>NO man ri&s;es to &s;uch height as to become con&s;picuous, but he is on one &s;ide cen&s;ured by undi&s;cerning malice, which reproaches him for his be&s;t actions and &s;landers his ap|parent and inconte&s;table excellencies; and idolized on the other &s;ide by ignorant admi|ration, which exalts his faults and follies into virtues. It may be ob&s;erved, that he by who&s;e intimacy his acquaintances imagine them&s;elves dignified, generally diffu&s;es a|mong them his mien and his habits; and in|deed without more vigilance than is generally applied to the regulation of the minuter parts of behaviour, it is not ea&s;y when we con|ver&s;e much with one who&s;e general character excites our veneration, to e&s;cape all conta|gion
<PB N="241" REF="242">
of his peculiarities, even when we do not deliberately think them worthy of our notice, and when they would have excited laughter or di&s;gu&s;t had they not been protect|ed by their alliance to nobler qualities, and accidentally con&s;orted with knowledge or with virtue.</P>
<P>THE faults of a man loved or honoured, &s;ometimes &s;teal &s;ecretly and imperceptibly upon the wi&s;e and virtuous, but by injudicious fondne&s;s or thoughtle&s;s vanity are often a|dopted with de&s;ign and boa&s;ted as re&s;emblan|ces of acknowledged merit. There is &s;carce any failing of mind or body, any error of opinion, or depravity of practice, which, in|&s;tead of producing &s;hame and di&s;content, its natural effects, has not at one time or other gladdened vanity with the hopes of prai&s;e, and been di&s;played with oftentatious indu&s;|try, by tho&s;e who &s;ought kindred minds among the wits of heroes, and could prove their re|lation only by &s;imilitude of deformity.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this perver&s;e ambition, every habit which rea&s;on condemns may be indulged and avowed. When a man is re|proached
<PB N="242" REF="243">
for his faults, he may indeed be par|doned though not commended if he endeavours to run for &s;helter to &s;ome celebrated name; but it is not to be &s;uffered that from the retreats to which he fled from infamy, he &s;hould i&s;&s;ue again with the confidence of conque&s;t, and call upon mankind for prai&s;es and rewards. Yet we &s;ee men that wa&s;te their patrimony in luxury, de&s;troy their health with debau|chery, and enervate their minds with idle|ne&s;s, becau&s;e there have been &s;ome whom luxury never could &s;ink into contempt, nor idlene&s;s hinder from the prai&s;e of genius.</P>
<P>THOSE who have &s;o much perplexed their ideas as to claim reputation from vice or, fol|ly, mercly becau&s;e they have been &s;ometimes by uncommon genius or virtue pre&s;erved from contempt, will &s;carcely be reclaimed; but this general inclination of mankind to copy characters in the gro&s;s without di&s;cri|mination, and the force which the recom|mendation of illu&s;trious examples adds to the allurements of vice, ought to be con&s;idered by all who&s;e character excludes them from the &s;hades of &s;ecrecy, as incitements to &s;cru|pulous caution and univer&s;al purity of man|ners.
<PB N="243" REF="244">
No man however en&s;laved to his ap|petites, or hurried by his pa&s;&s;ions, can, while he pre&s;erves his intellects unimpaired, plea&s;e him&s;elf with promoting the corruption of o|thers. He who&s;e merit has enlarged his in|fluence, would &s;urely wi&s;h to exert it for the benefit of mankind. Yet &s;uch will be the effect of his reputation while he &s;uffers him|&s;elf to indulge any favourite fault, that they who have no hope to reach his excellence, will catch at his &s;ailings, and his virtues will be cited to ju&s;tify the copiers of his vices.</P>
<P>IT is particularly the duty of tho&s;e who con&s;ign illu&s;trious names to po&s;terity, to take care le&s;t their readers be mi&s;led by ambiguous examples.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE writers who have undertaken the unpromi&s;ing ta&s;k of moderating de&s;ire, exert all the power of their eloquence, to &s;hew that happine&s;s is not the lot of man, and have by many arguments and examples proved the in&s;tability of every condition by which envy or ambition are excited. They have &s;et before our eyes all the calamities to which we are expo&s;ed from the frailty of nature, the influence of accident, or the &s;tra|tagems of malice; they have terrified great|ne&s;s
<PB N="245" REF="246">
with con&s;piracies, and riches with anxi|eties, wit with critici&s;m, and beauty with di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL the force of rea&s;on and all the charms of language are indeed nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport po&s;itions which every man hears with a wi&s;h to confute them. Truth finds an ea&s;y entrance into the mind when &s;he is introduced by de&s;ire, and attended by plea&s;ure; but when &s;he intrudes uncalled and brings only fear and &s;orrow in her train, the pa&s;&s;es of the intellect are barred again&s;t her by prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion; if &s;he &s;ometimes forces her way by the bat|teries of argument, &s;he &s;eldom long keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her conque&s;t, but is ejected by &s;ome favoured enemy, or at be&s;t obtains only a nominal &s;overeignty without influence and without authority.</P>
<P>THAT life is &s;hort we are all convinced, and yet &s;uffer not that conviction to repre&s;s our projects or limit our expectations; that life is mi&s;erable we all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and yet we believe that the time is near when we &s;hall feel it no longer. But to hope happine&s;s and immorta|lity is equally vain. Our &s;tate may indeed be more or le&s;s imbittered, as our duration
<PB N="246" REF="247">
may be more or le&s;s contracted; yet the ut|mo&s;t felicity which we can ever attain, will be little better than alleviation of mi&s;ery, and we &s;hall always feel more pain from our wants than plea&s;ure from our enjoyments. To de&s;troy the effect of all our &s;ucce&s;s, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that any &s;ignal calamity &s;hould fall upon us, that we &s;hould be harra&s;&s;ed by im|placable per&s;ecution, or excruciated by irreme|diable pains; the brighte&s;t hours of pro&s;perity have their clouds, and the &s;tream of life, if it is not ruffled by ob&s;tructions, will grow putrid by &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>I WAS de&s;cended of an ancient family, but my father re&s;olving not to imitate the folly of his ance&s;tors, who had hitherto left the younger &s;ons as encumbrances on the elde&s;t, de&s;tined me to a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion, and excited my diligence from my earlie&s;t years by repre&s;enta|tions of the penury and meanne&s;s in which I mu&s;t pa&s;s my time, if I did not rai&s;e my&s;elf to independence and plenty by hone&s;t appli|cation. I heard him with reverence, and endeavoured to obey him; and being careful to lo&s;e no opportunity of improvement, was at the u&s;ual time in which young men enter the
<PB N="247" REF="248">
world, well qualified for the exerci&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s which I had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>MY eagerne&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf in pub|lick, and my impatience of the narrow &s;cheme of life to which my indigence confined me, did not &s;uffer me to continue long in the town where I was born, and had always lived, ex|cept when the Univer&s;ity exacted my atten|dance. I went away as from a place of con|finement, with a re&s;olution to return no more, till I &s;hould be able to dazzle with my &s;plen|dor tho&s;e who now looked upon me with contempt, to reward tho&s;e who had paid honours to my dawning merit, and to &s;how all who had &s;uffered me to glide by them un|known and neglected, how much they mi&s;|took their intere&s;t in omitting to propitiate a genius like mine.</P>
<P>SUCH were my intentions when I &s;allied forth into the unknown world in que&s;t of riches and honours, which, with the confi|dence of unexperienced vivacity, I expected to procure in a very &s;hort time; for what could withold them from indu&s;try and knowledge? He that indulges hope will always be di&s;ap|pointed. Reputation indeed I very &s;oon ob|tained,
<PB N="248" REF="249">
but as merit is much more cheaply acknowledged than rewarded, I did not find my&s;elf yet enriched in proportion to my cele|brity. I was therefore &s;oon awakened from my dream of &s;udden affluence, but however was &s;ufficiently encouraged to per&s;everance by the gradual encrea&s;e of profit, and the pro&s;pect which every &s;tep of progre&s;&s;ive fortune opens to new advantages.</P>
<P>I HAD in time &s;urmounted the ob&s;tacles by which envy and competition ob&s;truct the fir&s;t attempts of a new claimant, and &s;aw my opponents and cen&s;urers tacitly confe&s;&s;ing their de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, by courting my friend&s;hip and yielding to my influence. They who once per&s;ued me, were now &s;atisfied to e&s;cape from me; and they who had before thought me pre|&s;umptuous in hoping to overtake them, had now their utmo&s;t wi&s;h, if they were permitted at no great di&s;tance quietly to follow me.</P>
<P>I DID not &s;uffer my &s;ucce&s;s to elate me to in&s;olence, nor made u&s;e of my &s;uperiority to return the injuries which I had &s;uffered only for endeavouring to gain it. I con&s;idered not my&s;elf as exempted from the nece&s;&s;ity of cau|tion; but remembered that, as no man can
<PB N="249" REF="250">
truly think his voyage ended while he is yet floating upon the water, however nearly he may approach the port, &s;o he that is yet at the mercy of the publick can never &s;afely relax his vigilance.</P>
<P>MY wants were not madly multiplied as my acqui&s;itions encrea&s;ed, and the time came at length when I thought my&s;elf enabled to gratify all rea&s;onable de&s;ires, and when, therefore, I re&s;olved no longer to tru&s;t my quiet to chance, but to enjoy that plenty and &s;erenity which I had been hitherto labouring to procure, to enjoy them while I was yet neither cru&s;hed by age into infirmity, nor &s;o habituated to a particular manner of life as to be unqualified for new &s;tudies or entertain|ments.</P>
<P>I NOW quitted my profe&s;&s;ion, and to &s;et my|&s;elf at once free from all importunities to re&s;ume it, changed my re&s;idence, and devoted the remaining part of my time to quiet and amu&s;ement. Amid&s;t innumerable projects of plea&s;ure which re&s;tle&s;s idlene&s;s incited me to form, and of which mo&s;t, when they came to &s;he moment of execution, were rejected for
<PB N="250" REF="251">
others of no longer continuance, &s;ome acci|dent revived in my imagination the plea&s;ing ideas of my native place. It was now in my power to vi&s;it tho&s;e from whom I had been &s;o long ab&s;ent, in &s;uch a manner as was con&s;i&s;tent with my former re&s;olution, and I wondered how it could happen that I had &s;o long delayed my own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>FULL of the admiration which I &s;hould excite, and the homage which I &s;hould receive, I dre&s;&s;ed my &s;ervants in a more oftentatious Livery, purcha&s;ed a mgnificent chariot, and re&s;olved to dazzle the inhabitants of the little town with an unexpected blaze of greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE the preparations that vanity re|quired were made for my departure, which, as workmen will not ea&s;ily be hurried beyond their ordinary rate, I thought very tedious, I &s;olaced my impatience with imaging the va|rious cen&s;ures that my appearance would pro|duce, the hopes which &s;ome would feel from my bounty, the terror which my power would &s;trike on others; the aukward re&s;pect with which I &s;hould be acco&s;ted by timorous offi|ciou&s;ne&s;s; and the di&s;tant reverence with
<PB N="251" REF="252">
which others le&s;s familiar to &s;plendor and dig|nity would be contented to gaze upon me, I deliberated a long time, whether I &s;hould im|mediately de&s;cend to a level with my former acquaintances, or make my conde&s;cen&s;ion more grateful by a gentle tran&s;ition from haughtine&s;s and re&s;erve. At length I deter|mined to forget &s;ome of my companions, till they di&s;covered them&s;elves by &s;ome indubitable token, and to receive the congratulations of others upon my good fortune with indiffe|rence, to &s;how that I always expected what I had now obtained. The acclamations of the populace I purpo&s;ed to reward with &s;ix hog&s;heads of ale, and a roa&s;ted ox, and then recommend to them to return to their work.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t all the trappings of grandeur were fitted, and I began the journey of triumph, which I could have wi&s;hed to have ended in the &s;ame moment, but my hor&s;es felt none of their ma&s;ter's ardour, and I was &s;haken four days upon rugged roads. I then entered the town, and having graciou&s;ly let fall the gla&s;&s;es that my per&s;on might be &s;een, pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly thro' the &s;treet. The noi&s;e of the wheels brought the inhabitants to their doors, but I
<PB N="252" REF="253">
could not perceive that I was known by them. At la&s;t I alighted, and my name I &s;uppo&s;e was told by my &s;ervants, for the barber &s;tept from the oppo&s;ite hou&s;e, and &s;eized me by the hand with hone&s;t joy in his countenance, which according to the rule that I had pre|&s;cribed to my&s;elf I repre&s;&s;ed with a frigid gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s. The fellow in&s;tead of &s;inking into dejection turned away with contempt, and left me to con&s;ider how the &s;econd &s;alutation &s;hould be received. The next friend was better treated, for I &s;oon found that I mu&s;t purcha&s;e by civility that regard which I had expected to enforce by in&s;olence.</P>
<P>THERE was yet no &s;moak of bonfires, no barmony of bells, no &s;hout of crouds, nor riot of joy; the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day went forward as before, and after having ordered a &s;plendid &s;upper which no man came to partake, and which my chagrin hindered me from ta&s;ting, I went to bed, where the vexation of di&s;ap|pointment overpowered the fatigue of my journey, and kept me from &s;leep.</P>
<P>I ROSE &s;o much humbled by tho&s;e morti|fications, as to enquire after the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
<PB N="253" REF="254">
the town, and found that I had been ab&s;ent too long to obtain the triumph which had flat|tered my expectation. Of the friends who&s;e compliments I expected &s;ome had long ago moved to di&s;tant provinces, &s;ome had lo&s;t in the maladies of age all &s;en&s;e of another's pro|&s;perity, and &s;ome had forgotten our former intimacy amid&s;t care and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Of three whom I had re&s;olved to puni&s;h for their former Offences by a longer continuance of neglect, one was, by his own indu&s;try, rai&s;ed above my &s;corn, and two were &s;heltered from it in the grave. All tho&s;e whom I loved, feared, or hated, all who&s;e envy or who&s;e kindne&s;s I had hopes of contemplating with plea&s;ure, were &s;wept away, and their place was filled by a new generation with other views and other competitions: and among many proofs of the impotence of wealth, I found that it conferred upon me very few di&s;tinctions in my native place.</P>

<P>NO complaint has been more frequently repeated in all ages than that of the neglect of merit a&s;&s;ociated with poverty, and the difficulty with which valuable or plea&s;ing qualities force them&s;elves into view, when they are ob&s;cured by indigence. It has been long ob&s;erved that native beauty has little power to charm without the ornaments which fortune be&s;tows, and that to want the favour of others is often &s;ufficient to hinder us from obtaining it.</P>
<P>EVERY day di&s;covers that mankind are not yet convinced of their error, or that their conviction is without power to influence their conduct; for poverty &s;till continues to pro|duce contempt, and &s;till ob&s;tructs the claims of kindred and of virtue. The eye of wealth is elevated towards higher &s;tations, and &s;el|dom de&s;cends to examine the actions of tho&s;e
<PB N="255" REF="256">
who are placed below the level of its notice, and who in di&s;tant regions and lower &s;ituati|ons are &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s, or toiling for bread. Among the multitudes overwhelmed with in&s;uperable calamity, it is common to find tho&s;e whom a very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance would enable to &s;upport them&s;elves with decency, and who yet cannot obtain from near rela|tions what they &s;ee hourly lavi&s;hed in often|tation, luxury, or frolick.</P>
<P>IT is certain that poverty does not ea&s;ily conciliate affection. He that has been con|fined from his infancy to the conver&s;ation of the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of mankind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily want tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which are the u&s;ual means of attracting kindne&s;s; and though truth, fortitude, and probity give an indi&s;putable right to reverence and kindne&s;s, they will not be di&s;tingui&s;hed by common eyes unle&s;s they are brightened by elegance of manners, but are ca&s;t a&s;ide like unpoli&s;hed gems, of which none but the arti&s;t knows the intrin&s;ick value, till their a&s;perities are &s;moothed and their incru&s;tations rubbed a|way.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="257">
THE gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of vulgar habits ob|&s;tructs the efficacy of virtue, as impurity and har&s;hne&s;s of &s;tile impairs the force of rea&s;on, and rugged numbers turn off the mind from artifice of di&s;po&s;ition, and vigour of invention. Few have &s;trength of rea&s;on &s;ufficient to over-rule the perceptions of &s;en&s;e; and yet fewer have &s;o much curio&s;ity or be|nevolence as to &s;truggle long again&s;t the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; he therefore who fails to plea&s;e in his &s;alutation and addre&s;s is commonly rejec|ted without farther trial, and never obtains an opportunity of &s;howing his latent excel|lencies, or e&s;&s;ential qualities.</P>
<P>IT is indeed not ea&s;y to pre&s;cribe a &s;ucce&s;s|&s;ul manner of approach to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or nece&s;&s;itous, who&s;e condition &s;ubjects every kind of behaviour equally to mi&s;carriage. He who&s;e confidence of merit meites him to meet without any apparent &s;en&s;e of in&s;erio|rity the eyes of tho&s;e who flattered them|&s;elves with their own dignity, is con&s;idered as an in&s;olent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, impatient of the ju&s;t prerogatives of rank and wealth, eager to u|&s;urp the &s;tation to when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
<PB N="257" REF="258">
and to confound the &s;ubordinations of &s;ocie|ty; and who would contribute to the exalta|tion of that &s;pirit, which even want and cala|mity are not able to re&s;train from rudene&s;s and rebellion?</P>
<P>BUT no better &s;ucce&s;s will commonly be found to attend &s;ervility and dejection, which often give pride the confidence to treat them with contempt. A reque&s;t made with diffi|dence and timidity is ea&s;ily denied, becau&s;e the petitioner him&s;elf &s;eems to doubt its fit|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>KINDNESS is generally reciprocal; we are de&s;irous of plea&s;ing others becau&s;e we receive plea&s;ure from them; but by what means can the man plea&s;e, who&s;e attention is engro&s;&s;ed by his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and who has no lei&s;ure to be officious; who&s;e will is re&s;trained by his nece&s;&s;ities, and who has no power to confer benefits; who&s;e temper is perhaps vitiated by mi&s;ery, and who&s;e under&s;tanding is impeded by ignorance?</P>
<P>IT is yet a more offen&s;ive di&s;couragement, that the &s;ame actions performed by different
<PB N="258" REF="259">
hands produce different effects, and in&s;tead of rating the man by his performances, we rate too frequently the performance by the man. It &s;ometimes happens in the combina|tions of life, that important &s;ervices are per|formed by inferiors; but though their zeal and activity may be paid by pecuniary re|wards, they &s;eldom excite that flow of grati|tude, or obtain that accumulation of recom|pence with which all think it their duty to acknowledge the favour of tho&s;e who de&s;cend to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a higher elevation. To be obliged, is to be in &s;ome re&s;pect inferior to another; and few willingly in|dulge the memory of an action which rai&s;es one whom they have always been accu&s;tom|ed to think below them, but &s;atisfy them|&s;elves with faint prai&s;e and penurious pay|ment, and then drive it from their own minds and endeavour to conceal it from the knowledge of others.</P>
<P>IT may be always objected to the &s;ervices of tho&s;e who can be &s;uppo&s;ed to want a re|ward, that they were produced not by kind|ne&s;s but intere&s;t; they are therefore, when they are no longer wanted, ea&s;ily di&s;regarded
<PB N="259" REF="260">
as arts of in&s;inuation, or &s;tratagems of &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, which it is ju&s;t and prudent to di&s;|countenance. Benefits which are received as gifts from wealth, are exacted as debts from indigence; and he that in a high &s;tation is celebrated for his genero&s;ity, would in a meaner condition have barely been confe&s;&s;ed to have done his duty.</P>
<P>IT is &s;earcely po&s;&s;ible for the utmo&s;t bene|volence to oblige, when exerted under the di&s;advantages of great inferiority, for by the habitual arrogance of wealth, &s;uch expecta|tions are commonly formed as no zeal or in|du&s;try can &s;atisfy; and what regard can he hope, who has done le&s;s than was demanded from him?</P>
<P>THERE are indeed kindne&s;&s;es conferred which were never purcha&s;ed by precedent fa|vours, and there is an affection not ari&s;ing from gratitude or intere&s;t, by which &s;imilar natures are attracted to each other, without pro&s;pect of any other advantage than the plea&s;ure of exchanging &s;entiments, and the hope of confirming their e&s;teem of them|&s;elves by the approbation of each other.
<PB N="260" REF="261">
But this &s;pontaneous fondne&s;s &s;eldom ri&s;es at the &s;ight of poverty, which every one regards with habitual contempt, and of which the ap|plau&s;e is no more courted by vanity, than the countenance is &s;olicited by ambition. The mo&s;t generous and di&s;intere&s;ted friend|&s;hip mu&s;t be re&s;olved at la&s;t into the love of our&s;elves; he therefore who&s;e reputa|tion or dignity inclines us to con&s;ider his e&s;|teem as a te&s;timonial of de&s;ert, will always find our hearts open to his endearments. We every day &s;ee men of eminence followed with all the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of dependance, and courted with all the blandi&s;hments of flattery, by tho&s;e who want nothing from them but profe&s;&s;ions of regard, and who think them&s;elves liberally rewarded by a bow, a &s;mile, or an embrace.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e prejudices which every mind feels more or le&s;s in favour of riches, ought like other opinions which only cu&s;tom and example have impre&s;&s;ed upon us, to be in time &s;ubjected to rea&s;on. We mu&s;t learn how to &s;eparate the real character from extra|neous adhe&s;ions and ca&s;ual circum&s;tances, to con&s;ider clo&s;ely him whom we are about to
<PB N="261" REF="262">
adopt or to reject; to regard his inclinations as well as his actions; to trace out tho&s;e vir|tues which lie torpid in the heart for want of opportunity, and tho&s;e vices that lurk un|&s;een by the ab&s;ence of temptation; that when we find worth faintly &s;hooting in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity, we may let in light and &s;un|&s;hine upon it, and ripen barren volition into efficacy and power.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not common to envy tho&s;e with whom we cannot ea&s;ily be placed in com|pari&s;on. Every man &s;ees without malevo|lence the progre&s;s of another in the tracks of
<PB N="622" REF="263">
life, which he has him&s;elf no de&s;ire to tread, and hears without inclination to cavils or contradiction the renown of tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;tance will not &s;uffer them to draw the at|tention of mankind from his own merit. The &s;ailor never thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to con|te&s;t the lawyer's abilities; nor would the <HI>Rambler,</HI> however jealous of his reputation, be much di&s;turbed by the &s;ucce&s;s of rival wits at <HI>Agra</HI> or <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></P>
<P>WE do not therefore a&s;cribe to you any &s;uperlative degree of virtue, when we believe that we may inform you of our change of condition without danger of malignant fa&s;ci|nation; and that when you read of the mar|riage of your corre&s;pondents <HI>Hymenaeus</HI> and <HI>Tranquilla,</HI> you will join your wi&s;hes to tho&s;e of their other friends for the happy event of an union in which caprice and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s had &s;o little part.</P>
<P>THERE is at lea&s;t this rea&s;on why we &s;hould be le&s;s deceived in our connubial hopes than many who enter into the &s;ame &s;tate, that we have allowed our&s;elves to form no unrea&s;onable expectations, nor vitiated our
<PB N="263" REF="264">
fancies in the &s;oft hours of court&s;hip, with vi&s;ions of felicity which human power can|not be&s;tow, or of perfection which human virtue can not attain. That impartiality with which we endeavoured to in&s;pect the man|ners of all whom we have known was never &s;o much overpowered by our pa&s;&s;ion, but that we di&s;covered &s;ome faults and weak|ne&s;&s;es in each other; and joined our hands in conviction, that as there are advantages to be enjoyed in marriage, there are inconvenien|cies likewi&s;e to be endured; and that toge|ther with confederate intellects and auxiliar virtues, we mu&s;t find different opinions and oppo&s;ite inclinations.</P>
<P>WE however flatter our&s;elves, for who is not flattered by him&s;elf as well as by others on the day of marriage, that we are emi|nently qualified to give mutual plea&s;ure. Our birth is without any &s;uch remarkable di&s;pari|ty as can give either an opportunity of in|&s;ulting the other with pompous names and &s;plendid alliances, or of calling in upon any dome&s;tick controver&s;y the overbearing a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of powerful relations. Our fortune was equally &s;uitable, &s;o that we meet with|out
<PB N="264" REF="265">
any of tho&s;e obligations which always produce reproach or &s;u&s;picion of reproach, which, though they may be forgotten in the gaieties of the fir&s;t month, no delicacy will always &s;uppre&s;s, or of which the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a new favour, to be repaid by tamene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, till grati|tude takes the place of love, and the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing degenerates by degrees into the fear of offending.</P>
<P>THE &s;ettlements cau&s;ed no delay; for we did not tru&s;t our affairs to the negotiation of wretches who would have paid their court by multiplying &s;tipulations. <HI>Tranquilla</HI> &s;corned to detain any part of her fortune from him into who&s;e hands &s;he delivered up her per|&s;on; and <HI>Hymenaeus</HI> thought no act of ba&s;e|ne&s;s more criminal than his who en&s;laves his wife by her own genero&s;ity, who by marry|ing without a jointure condemns her to all the dangers of accident and caprice, and at la&s;t boa&s;ts his liberality by granting what on|ly the indi&s;cretion of her kindne&s;s enabled him to withhold. He therefore received on the common terms the portion which any other woman might have brought him, and re&s;erved
<PB N="265" REF="266">
all the exuberance of acknowledgment for tho&s;e excellencies which he has yet been able to di&s;cover only in <HI>Tranquilla.</HI></P>
<P>WE did not pa&s;s the weeks of court&s;hip like tho&s;e who con&s;ider them&s;elves as taking the la&s;t draught of plea&s;ure, and re&s;olve not to quit the bowl without a &s;urfeit, or who know them&s;elves about to &s;et happi|ne&s;s to hazard, and endeavour to lo&s;e their &s;en&s;e of danger in the ebriety of perpetual amu&s;ement, and whirl round the gulph be|fore they &s;ink. <HI>Hymenaeus</HI> often repeated a me|dical axiom, that <HI>the &s;uccours of &s;ickne&s;s ought not to be wa&s;ted in health.</HI> We know that however our eyes may yet &s;parkle, and our hearts bound at the pre&s;ence of each other, the time of li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;atiety, of pevi&s;h|ne&s;s and di&s;content mu&s;t come at la&s;t, in which we &s;hall be driven for relief to &s;hews and recreations; that the uniformity of life mu&s;t be &s;ometimes diver&s;ified, and the vacu|ities of conver&s;ation &s;ometimes &s;upplied. We rejoice in the reflection that we have &s;tores of novelty yet unexhau&s;ted, which may be opened when repletion &s;hall call for change, and gratifications yet unta&s;ted, by which life
<PB N="266" REF="267">
when it &s;hall become vapid or bitter may be re&s;tored to its former &s;weetne&s;s and &s;pright|line&s;s, and again irritate the appetite, and again &s;parkle in the cup.</P>
<P>OUR time will probably be le&s;s ta&s;tele&s;s than that of tho&s;e whom the authority and a|varice of parents unites almo&s;t without their con&s;ent in their early years, before they have accumulated any fund of reflection, or col|lected materials for mutual entertainment. Such we have often &s;een ri&s;ing in the morn|ing to cards, and retiring in the afternoon to do&s;e, who&s;e happine&s;s was celebrated by their neighbours, becau&s;e they happened to grow rich by par&s;imony, and to be kept quiet by in|&s;en&s;ibility, and agreed to eat and to &s;leep to|gether.</P>
<P>WE have both mingled with the world, and are therefore no &s;trangers to the faults and virtues, the de&s;igns and competitions, the hopes and fears of our contemporaries. We have both amu&s;ed our lei&s;ure with books, and can therefore recount the events of for|mer times, or cite the dictates of antient wi&s;|dom.
<PB N="267" REF="268">
Every occurrence furni&s;hes us with &s;ome hint which one or the other can im|prove, and if it &s;hould happen that memory or imagination fail us, we can retire to no idle or unimproving &s;olitude.</P>
<P>THO' our characters beheld at a di&s;tance, exhibit this general re&s;emblance, yet a nearer in&s;pection di&s;covers &s;uch a di&s;&s;imilitude of our habitudes and &s;entiments, as leaves each &s;ome peculiar advantages, and affords that <HI>concoraia di&s;cors,</HI> that &s;uitable di&s;agreement which is always nece&s;&s;ary to intellectual har|mony. There may be a total diver&s;ity of ideas which admits no participation of the &s;ame delight, and there may likewi&s;e be &s;uch a con&s;ormity of notions, as leaves neither any thing to add to the deci&s;ions of the other. With &s;uch contrariety there can be no peace, with &s;uch &s;imilarity there can be no plea&s;ure. Our rea&s;onings, though often formed upon different views, terminate generally in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. Our thoughts like rivulets i&s;&s;uing from di&s;tant &s;prings, are each impreg|nated in its cour&s;e with various mixtures, and tinged by infu&s;ions unknown to the other, yet at la&s;t ea&s;ily unite into one &s;tream,
<PB N="268" REF="269">
and purify them&s;elves by the gentle efferve&s;|cence of contrary qualities.</P>
<P>THESE benefits we receive in a greater de|gree as we conver&s;e without re&s;erve, becau&s;e we have nothing to conceal. We have no debts to be paid by imperceptible deductions from avowed expences, no habits to be in|dulged by the private &s;ub&s;erviency of a fa|voured &s;ervant, no private interviews with needy relations, no intelligence with &s;pies placed upon each other. We con&s;idered mar|riage as the mo&s;t &s;olemn league of perpetual friend&s;hip, a &s;tate from which artifice and concealment are to be bani&s;hed for ever, and in which every act of di&s;&s;imulation is a breach of faith.</P>
<P>The impetuous vivacity of youth, and that ardor of de&s;ire, which the fir&s;t &s;ight of plea|&s;ure naturally produces, have long cea&s;ed to hurry us into irregularity and vehemence; and experience has &s;hewn us that few gratifi|cations are too valuable to be &s;acrificed to complai&s;ance. We have thought it conveni|ent to re&s;t from the fatigue of plea&s;ure, and now only continue that cour&s;e of life into

which we had before entered, confirmed in our choice by mutual approbation, &s;upported in our re&s;olution by mutual encouragement, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in our efforts by mutual exhor|tation.</P>

But if all our prudence has been vain, and we are doomed to give one in&s;tance more of the un|certainty of human di&s;cernment, we &s;hall comfort our&s;elves amid&s;t our di&s;appointments, that we were not betrayed but by &s;uch delu|&s;ions as caution could not e&s;cape, &s;ince we &s;ought happine&s;s only in the arms of virtue.

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by <HI>Boileau,</HI> that "a mean or common thought expre&s;&s;ed in pompous diction, generally plea&s;es more than a new or noble &s;entiment delivered in low and vulgar language; becau&s;e the number is greater of tho&s;e whom cu&s;tom has enabled to judge of words, than whom &s;tudy has qualified to examine Things."</P>
<P>THIS &s;olution might &s;atisfy, if &s;uch only were offended with meanne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion as are unable to di&s;tingui&s;h propriety of thought, and to &s;eparate propo&s;itions or images from the vehicles by which they are conveyed to the under&s;tanding. But this kind of di&s;gu&s;t is by no means confined to the ignorant or &s;uper|ficial; it operates uniformly and univer&s;ally upon readers of all cla&s;&s;es; every man, how|ever
<PB N="271" REF="272">
profound or ab&s;tracted, perceives him|&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly alienated by low terms, and they who profe&s;s the mo&s;t zealous adherence to truth are forced to admit that &s;he owes part of her charms to her ornaments, and lo&s;es much of her power over the &s;oul, when &s;he appears di&s;graced by a dre&s;s uncouth or ill-adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>WE are all offended by low terms, but are not plea&s;ed or di&s;gu&s;ted alike by the &s;ame com|po&s;itions, becau&s;e we do not all agree to cen|&s;ure the &s;ame terms as low. No word is naturally or intrin&s;ically meaner than another; our notions therefore of words, as of other things arbitrarily and capriciou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, depend wholly upon accident and cu&s;tom. The cottager thinks tho&s;e apartments &s;plendid and &s;pacious, which an inhabitant of palaces will de&s;pi&s;e for their inelegance; and to him who has pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of his hours with the delicate and polite, many expre&s;&s;ions will &s;eem de&s;picable and fordid, which another, equally acute and judicious may hear without offence; but a mean term never fails to di&s;plea&s;e him to whom it appears mean, as poverty is cer|tainly and invariably de&s;pi&s;ed, though he who
<PB N="272" REF="273">
is poor in the opinion of &s;ome, may by others be envied for his wealth.</P>
<P>WORDS become low by the occa&s;ions to which they are applied, or the general cha|racter of them who u&s;e them; and the di&s;gu&s;t which they produce, ari&s;es from the revival of tho&s;e images with which they are com|monly united. Thus if, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn di&s;cour&s;e, a phra&s;e happens to occur which has been &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in &s;ome ludicrous narrative, the grave&s;t auditor finds it difficult to re&s;rain from laughter, when they who are not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame accidental a&s;&s;ocia|tion are utterly unable to gue&s;s the rea&s;on of his merriment. Words which convey ideas of dignity in one age, are bani&s;hed from elegant writing or conver&s;ation in another, becau&s;e they are in time deba&s;ed by vulgar mouths, and can be no longer heard with|out the involuntary recollection of unplea&s;ing images.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Macbeth</HI> is confirming him&s;elf in his horrid purpo&s;e, he breaks out amid&s;t the violence of his emotions into a wi&s;h natural to a murderer, <Q><PB N="273" REF="274"><L>&mdash;Come, thick night!</L>
<L>And pall thee in the dunne&s;t &s;moke of hell,</L>
<L>That may keen knife &s;ee not the wound it makes;</L>
<L>Nor heav'n peep through the blanket of the dark,</L>
<L>To cry, hold, hold!&mdash;</L></Q> In this pa&s;&s;age is exerted all the force of poetry, that force which calls new powers into being, which embodies &s;entiment, and animates mat|ter; yet prehaps &s;carce any man now peru&s;es it without &s;ome di&s;turbance of his attention from the counteraction of the words to the ideas. What can be more dreadful than to implore the pre&s;ence of night, inve&s;ted not in common ob&s;curity, but in the &s;moke of hell? Yet the efficacy of this invocation is de&s;troyed by the in&s;ertion of an epithet now &s;eldom heard but in the &s;table, and <HI>dun</HI> night may come or go without any other notice than contempt.</P>
<P>IF we &s;tart into raptures when &s;ome hero of the Iliad tells us that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, his lance rages with eagerne&s;s to de&s;troy; if we are
<PB N="274" REF="275">

<L>In &s;ia credebant redituras membra &s;ecures,</L></Q> we cannot &s;urely but &s;ympathi&s;e with the horrors of a wretch about to murder his ma&s;ter, his friend, his benefactor, who &s;u&s;pects that the weapon will refu&s;e its office, and &s;tart back from the brea&s;t which he is preparing to violate. Yet this &s;entiment is weakened by the name of an in&s;trument u&s;ed by butchers and cooks in the meane&s;t employments; we do not immediately conceive that any crime of importance is to be committed with a <HI>knife,</HI> and at la&s;t from the long habit of connecting a knife with &s;ordid offices, feel aver&s;ion ra|ther than terror.</P>
<P><HI>MACKBETH</HI> proceeds to wi&s;h, in the madne&s;s of guilt, that the in&s;pection of heaven may be intercepted, and that he may in the involutions of infernal darkne&s;s e&s;cape the eye of providence. This is the utmo&s;t
<PB N="275" REF="276">
extravagance of determined wickedne&s;s; yet this is &s;o deba&s;ed by two unfortunate words, that while I endeavour to impre&s;s on my reader the energy of the &s;entiment, I can &s;carce cheek my ri&s;ibility, when the expre&s;&s;ion forces it&s;elf upon my mind; for who without &s;ome relaxa|tion of his gravity can hear of the avengers of guilt <HI>peeping through a Blanket?</HI></P>
<P>THESE imperfections of diction are le&s;s obvious to the reader, as he is le&s;s acquainted with the common u&s;ages of the age; they are therefore wholly imperceptible to a foreigner, who learns our language only from books, nor will &s;trike a &s;olitary academick &s;o forcibly as a modi&s;h lady.</P>
<P>AMONG the numerous requi&s;ites that mu&s;t concur to compleat an author, few are of more importance than an early entrance into the living world. The &s;eeds of knowledge may be planted in &s;olitude, but mu&s;t be cultivated in publick. Argumentation may be taught in colleges, and theories formed in retirement, but the artifice of embelli&s;hment, and the powers of attraction can be gained only by general conver&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="277">
AN acquaintance with prevailing cu&s;toms and fa&s;hionable elegance is nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e for other purpo&s;es. The injury that noble &s;entiments &s;uffer from un&s;uitable language, per&s;onal merit may ju&s;tly fear from rudene&s;s and indelicacy. When the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Aeneas</HI> depended on the favour of the queen upon who&s;e coa&s;ts he was driven, his cele&s;tial protectre&s;s thought him not &s;ufficiently &s;ecured again&s;t rejection by his piety or bravery, but decorated him for the interview with preternatural beauty. Whoever de&s;ires, what none can rea&s;onably contemn, the favour of mankind, mu&s;t endeavour to add grace to &s;trength, to make his conver&s;ation agreeable as well as u&s;e|ful, and to accompli&s;h him&s;elf with the petty qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to make the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions in his favour. Many complain of neglect who never u&s;ed any efforts to attract regard. It cannot be expected that the patrons of &s;cience or virtue &s;hould be &s;olicitous to di&s;cover excellencies which they who po&s;&s;e&s;s them never di&s;play. Few have abilities &s;o much needed by the re&s;t of the world as to be care&s;&s;ed on their own terms; and he that will not conde&s;cend to recommend him&s;elf by ex|ternal

<P>NATURAL hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, that what|ever is formed for long duration arrives &s;lowly to its maturity. Thus the firme&s;t timber is of tardy growth, and animals ge|nerally exceed each other in longevity in pro|portion to the time between their conception and their birth.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be extended to the offspring of the mind. Ha&s;ty compo&s;i|tions, however they plea&s;e at fir&s;t by flowery luxuriance, and &s;pread in the &s;un-&s;hine of temporary favour, can &s;eldom endure the change of &s;ea&s;ons, but peri&s;h at the fir&s;t bla&s;t of critici&s;m, or fro&s;t of neglect. When <HI>A|pelles</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="279">
was reproached with the paucity of his productions, and the ince&s;&s;ant attention with which he retouched his pieces, he conde&s;|cended to make no other an&s;wer than that <HI>he painted for perpetuity.</HI></P>
<P>No vanity can more ju&s;tly incur contempt and indignation than that which boa&s;ts of negligence and hurry. For who can bear with patience the writer who claims &s;uch &s;upe|riority to the re&s;t of his &s;pecies, as to ima|gine that mankind are at lei&s;ure for attention to his extemporary &s;allies, and that po&s;terity will repo&s;ite his ca&s;ual effu&s;ions among the trea&s;ures of antient wi&s;dom?</P>
<P>MEN have &s;ometimes appeared of &s;uch tran&s;cendent abilities, that their &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t cur&s;ory performances excel all that la|bour and &s;tudy can enable meaner intellects to compo&s;e, as there are &s;ome regions of which the &s;pontaneous products cannot be e|quailed in other &s;oils by care and culture. But it is no le&s;s dangerous for any man to place him&s;elf in this rank of under&s;tanding, and fancy that he is born to be illu&s;trious without labour, than to omit the cares of hu&s;bandry,
<PB N="279" REF="280">
and expect from his grounds the fruits of <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>THE greater part of tho&s;e who congratulate them&s;elves upon their intellectual dignity, and u&s;urp the privileges of genius, are men whom only them&s;elves would ever have marked out as enriched by uncommon liberalities of na|ture, or entitled to veneration and immorta|lity on ea&s;ier terms than others. This ardor of confidence is u&s;ually &s;ound among men who have not enlarged their notions by books or conver&s;ation; but are per&s;uaded by the partia|lity which we all feel in our own &s;avour, that they have reached the &s;ummit of excel|lence, becau&s;e they di&s;cover none higher than them&s;elve; they acquie&s;ce in the fir&s;t thoughts that occur, becau&s;e the &s;cantine&s;s of their knowledge allows them no choice, and the narrowne&s;s of their views affords them no glimp&s;e of that &s;ublime idea which hu|man indu&s;try has from the fir&s;t ages been vainly toiling to approach. They &s;ee a little, and believe that there is nothing beyond their &s;phere of vi&s;ion, as the <HI>Patuecos</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> who inhabited a &s;mall valley, concerned the &s;urrounding mountains to be the be meanes of the world. In proportion as perfection is
<PB N="280" REF="281">
more di&s;tinctly conceived, the plea&s;ure of contemplating our own performances will be le&s;&s;ened; it may therefore be ob&s;erved, that they who mo&s;t de&s;erve prai&s;e, are often afraid to decide in favour of their own performan|ces; they know how much is &s;till wanting to their completion, and wait with anxiety and terror the determination of the publick. <HI>I plea&s;e every one el&s;e,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tully, but never &s;a|tisfy my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>IT has often been enquired, why, not|with&s;tanding the advances of latter ages in &s;cience, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> fu&s;ion of &s;o many new ideas has given us, we &s;till fall below the ancients in the art of compo&s;i|tion. Some part of their &s;uperiority may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the graces of their language, from which the mo&s;t poli&s;hed of the pre&s;ent <HI>European</HI> tongues, are nothing more than barbarous degenerations. Some advantage they might gain merely by priority, which put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t natural &s;entiments, and left us nothing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> re|petition or forced conceits. But the greater part of their prai&s;e &s;eems to have the ju&s;t re|ward of mode&s;ty and labour. Their &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="281" REF="282">
human weakne&s;s confined them commonly to one &s;tudy, which their knowledge of the extent of every &s;cience engaged them to pro|&s;ecute with indefatigable diligence.</P>
<P>AMONG the writers of antiquity I remem|ber none except <HI>Statius,</HI> who ventures to mention the &s;peedy production of his wri|tings, either as an extenuation of his faults or a proof of his facility. Nor did <HI>Statius,</HI> when he con&s;idered him&s;elf as a candidate for la&s;ting reputation, think a clo&s;er attention unnece&s;&s;ary, but amid&s;t all his pride and in|digence, the two great ha&s;teners of modern poems, employed twelve years upon the <HI>The|baid,</HI> and thinks his claim to renown propor|tionate to his labour. <Q><L>Thebais, multa cruciata lima,</L>
<L>Tentat, audaci fide, Mantuanae</L>
<L>Gaudia famae.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>OVID</HI> indeed apologizes in his bani&s;h|ment for the imperfection of his letters, but mentions his want of lei&s;ure, to poli&s;h them as an addition to his calamities, and was &s;o far from imagining revi&s;als and corrections
<PB N="282" REF="283">
unnece&s;&s;ary, that at his departure from <HI>Rome,</HI> he threw his metamorpho&s;es into the fire, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;graced by a book which he could not hope to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems not often to have happened, that the &s;ame writer a&s;pired to reputation in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, and of tho&s;e few that attempted &s;uch diver&s;ity of excellence, I know not that any one &s;ucceeded. Contrary characters they never imagined a &s;ingle mind able to &s;upport, and therefore, no man is recorded to have undertaken more than one kind of dramatick poetry.</P>
<P>WHAT they had written, they did not venture in their fir&s;t fondne&s;s to thru&s;t into the world; but con&s;idering the impropriety of doing precipitately that which cannot be recalled, deferred the publication, if not nine years, according to the direction of <HI>Horace,</HI> yet till their fancy was cooled after the rap|tures of invention, and the glare of novelty had cea&s;ed to dazzle the judgment.</P>
<P>THERE were in tho&s;e days no weekly or diurnal writers, <HI>multa dies,</HI> &amp; <HI>multa litura,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="284">
much time, and many ra&s;ures, were con&s;i|dered as indi&s;pen&s;ible requi&s;ites; and that no other method of attaining la&s;ting prai&s;e has been yet di&s;covered, may be conjectured from the blotted manu&s;cripts of <HI>Milton</HI> now remain|ing, and the tardy emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Pope</HI>'s compo|&s;itions, delayed more than once till the inci|dents to which they alladed were forgotten, till his enemies were &s;ecure from his &s;atire, and what to an hone&s;t mind mu&s;t be more painful, his friends were deaf to his enco|miums.</P>
<P>TO him, who&s;e eagerne&s;s of prai&s;e hurries his productions &s;oon into the light, many im|perfections are unavoidable even where the mind furni&s;hes the materials, as well as regu|lates their di&s;po&s;ition, and nothing depends upon &s;earch or information. Delay opens new veins of thought, the &s;ubject di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for a time appears with a new train of depen|dant images, the accidents of reading or con|ver&s;ation &s;upply new ornaments or allu&s;ions, or mere intermi&s;&s;ion of the fatigue of think|ing enable, the mind to collect new &s;orce, and make new excur&s;ions. But all tho&s;e be|nefits come too late for him, who when he
<PB N="284" REF="285">
was weary with labour, &s;natched at the re|compence, and gave his performance to his friends and his enemies as &s;oon as impatience and pride per&s;uaded him to conclude it.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t pernicious effects of ha&s;te, is ob&s;curity. He that teems with a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, and perceives how one &s;entiment produces another, ea&s;ily be|lieves that he can clearly expre&s;s what he &s;o &s;trongly comprehends; he &s;eldom &s;u&s;pects his thoughts of embarra&s;ment while he pre&s;erves in his own memory the &s;eries of connection, or his diction of ambiguity while only one &s;en&s;e is pre&s;ent to his mind. Yet if he has been employed on an ab&s;tru&s;e or complicated argument, he will find, when he has a while withdrawn his mind, and returns as a new rea|der to his work, that he has only a conjectural glimp&s;e of his own meaning, and that to ex|plain it to tho&s;e whom he de&s;ires to in&s;truct, he mu&s;t open his &s;entiments, di&s;entangle his method, and alter his arrangement.</P>
<P>AUTHORS and lovers always &s;uffer &s;ome infatuation, from which only ab&s;ence can &s;et them free; and every man ought to re&s;tore

<P>I AM one of tho&s;e beings, from whom many, that melt at the &s;ight of all other mi&s;ery, think it meritorious to withhold re|lief; one whom the rigour of virtuous indig|nation dooms to &s;uffer without complaint, and peri&s;h without regard; and whom I my|&s;elf have formerly in&s;ulted in the pride of re|putation and &s;ecurity of innocence.</P>
<P>I AM of a good family, but my father was burthened with more children than he could decently &s;upport. A wealthy relation, as he
<PB N="286" REF="287">
travelled from <HI>London</HI> to his country &s;eat, conde&s;cending to make him a vi&s;it, was touched with compa&s;&s;ion of his narrow for|tune, and re&s;olved to ea&s;e him of part of his charge by taking the care of a child upon him&s;elf. Di&s;tre&s;s on one &s;ide and ambition on the other, were too powerful for parental fondne&s;s, and the little family pa&s;&s;ed in re|view before him that he might make his choice. I was then ten years old, and without know|ing for what purpo&s;e I was called to my great cou&s;in, endeavoured to recommend my&s;elf by my be&s;t courte&s;y, &s;ung him my prettie&s;t &s;ong, told the la&s;t &s;tory that I had read, and &s;o much endeared my&s;elf by my innocence, that he declared his re&s;olution to adopt me, and to educate me with his own daughters.</P>
<P>MY parents felt the common &s;truggles at the thought of parting, and <HI>&s;ome natural tears they dropp'd, but wip'd them &s;oon.</HI> They con|&s;idered, not without that fal&s;e e&s;timation of the value of wealth which poverty long con|tinued always produces, that I was rai&s;ed to higher rank than they could give me, and to hopes of more ample fortune than they could bequeath. My mother &s;old &s;ome of her or|naments

<P>MY &s;i&s;ters envied my new finery, and &s;eemed not much to regret our &s;eparation; my father conducted me to the &s;tage-coach with a kind of chearful tenderne&s;s; and in a very &s;hort time, I was tran&s;ported to &s;plendid apartments, and a luxurious table, and grew familiar to &s;how, noi&s;e, and gaiety.</P>
<P>IN three years my mother died, having implored a ble&s;&s;ing on her family with her la&s;t breath. I had little opportunity to in|dulge a &s;orrow which there was none to par|take with me, and therefore &s;oon cea&s;ed to reflect much upon my lo&s;s. My father turn|ed all his care upon his other children, whom &s;ome fortunate adventures and unexpected le|gacies enabled him, when he died four years
<PB N="288" REF="289">
after my mother, to leave in a condition a|bove their expectations.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have &s;hared the encrea&s;e of his fortune, and had once a portion a&s;&s;igned me in his will; but my cou&s;in a&s;&s;uring him that all care for me was needle&s;s, &s;ince he had re|&s;olved to place me happily in the world, di|rected him to divide my part among&s;t my &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>THUS I was thrown upon dependance without re&s;ource. Being now at an age in which young women are initiated in com|pany, I was no longer to be &s;upported in my former character but at con&s;iderable ex|pence; &s;o that partly le&s;t I &s;hould wa&s;te mo|ney, and partly le&s;t my appearance might draw too many compliments and a&s;&s;iduities, I was in&s;en&s;ibly degraded from my equality, and enjoyed few privileges above the head &s;ervant, but that of receiving no wages.</P>
<P>I FELT every indignity, but knew that re|&s;entment would precipitate my fall. I there|fore endeavoured to continue my impor|tance by little &s;ervices and active officiou&s;|ne&s;s,
<PB N="289" REF="290">
and for a time pre&s;erved my&s;elf from neglect, by withdrawing all pretences to competition, and &s;tudying to plea&s;e rather than to &s;hine. But my intere&s;t notwith&s;tand|ing this expedient hourly declined, and my cou&s;in's favourite maid began to exchange re|partees with me, and con&s;ult me about the alterations of a ca&s;t gown.</P>
<P>I WAS now completely depre&s;&s;ed, and though I had &s;een mankind enough to know the nece&s;&s;ity of outward chearfulne&s;s, I often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief, or turn my condition in my mind, and exa|mine by what means I might e&s;cape from perpetual mortification. At la&s;t, my &s;chemes and &s;orrows were interrupted by a &s;udden change of my relation's behaviour, who one day took an occa&s;ion when we were left to|gether in a room, to bid me &s;uffer my&s;elf no longer to be in&s;ulted, but a&s;&s;ume the place which he always intended me to hold in the family. He a&s;&s;ured me, that his wife's pre|ference of her own daughters &s;hould never hurt me; and, accompanying his profe&s;&s;ions with a pur&s;e of gold, ordered me to be&s;peak a rich &s;uit at the mercer's, and to apply pri|vately
<PB N="290" REF="291">
to him for money when I wanted it, and infinuate that my other friends &s;upplied me, which he would take care to confirm.</P>
<P>BY this &s;tratagem which I did not then under&s;tand, he filled me with tenderne&s;s and gratitude, compelled me to repo&s;e on him as my only &s;upport, and produced a nece&s;&s;ity of private conver&s;ation. He often appointed in|terviews at the hou&s;e of an acquaintance, and &s;ometimes called on me with a coach and carried me abroad. My &s;en&s;e of his fa|vour, and the de&s;ire of retaining it, di&s;po&s;ed me to unlimited complai&s;ance, and though I &s;aw his kindne&s;s grow every day more fond, I did not &s;uffer any &s;u&s;picion to enter my thoughts. At la&s;t the wretch took advantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which he exact|ed as my benefactor, to complete the ruin of an orphan whom his own promi&s;es had made indigent, whom his indulgence had melted, and his authority &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>I KNOW not why it &s;hould afford &s;ubject of exultation, to overpower on any terms the re&s;olution, or &s;urpri&s;e the caution of a girl;
<PB N="291" REF="292">
but of all the boa&s;ters that deck them&s;elves in the &s;poils of innocence and beauty, they &s;urely have the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to triumph, who &s;ubmit to owe their &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ome ca&s;ual influence. They neither employ the graces of fancy, nor the force of under&s;tanding, in their attempts; they cannot plea&s;e their vanity with the art of their approaches, the delicacy of their adulations, the elegance of their ad|dre&s;s, or the efficacy of their eloquence; nor applaud them&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any qualities, by which affection is attracted. They &s;ur|mount no ob&s;tacles, they defeat no rivals, but attack only tho&s;e who cannot re&s;i&s;t, and are often content to po&s;&s;e&s;s the body without any &s;olicitude to gain the heart.</P>
<P>MANY of the&s;e de&s;picable wretches does my pre&s;ent acquaintance with infamy and wicked|ne&s;s enable me to number among the heroes of debauchery. Reptiles whom their own &s;er|vants would have de&s;pi&s;ed, had they not been their &s;ervants, and with whom beggary would have di&s;dained intercour&s;e, had &s;he not been allured by hopes of relief. Many of the beings which are now rioting in taverns or &s;hivering
<PB N="292" REF="293">
in the &s;treets, have been corrupted not by arts of gallantry which &s;tole gradually upon the affections and laid prudence a&s;leep, but by the fear of lo&s;ing benefits which were never intended, or of incurring re&s;entment which they could not e&s;cape; &s;ome have been frighted by ma&s;ters, and &s;ome awed by guardians into ruin.</P>
<P>OUR crime had its u&s;ual con&s;equence, and he &s;oon perceived that I could not long con|tinue in his family. I was di&s;tracted at the thought of the reproach which I now believed inevitable. He comforted me with hopes of eluding all di&s;covery, and often upbraided me with the anxiety, which perhaps none but him&s;elf &s;aw in my countenance; but at la&s;t mingled his a&s;&s;urances of protection and main|tenance with menaces of total de&s;ertion, if in the moments of perturbation I &s;hould &s;uffer his &s;ecret to e&s;cape, or endeavour to throw on him any part of my infamy.</P>
<P>THUS pa&s;&s;ed the di&s;mal hours till my re|treat could no longer be delayed. It was pre|tended that my relations had &s;ent for me to a

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MISELLA now &s;its down to con|tinue her narrative. I am convinced that nothing would more powerfully pre&s;erve youth from irregularity, or guard inexperience from &s;eduction, than a ju&s;t de&s;cription of the condition into which the wanton plunges her|&s;elf, and therefore hope that my letter may be a &s;ufficient antidote to my example.</P>
<P>AFTER the di&s;traction, he&s;itation and delays which the timidity of guilt naturally produces,
<PB N="294" REF="295">
I was removed to lodgings in a di&s;tant part of the town under one of the characters com|monly a&s;&s;umed upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. Here being by my circum&s;tances condemned to &s;olitude, I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of my hours in bitter|ne&s;s and angui&s;h. The conver&s;ation of the people with whom I was placed, was not at all capable of engaging my attention or di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the reigning ideas. The books which I carried to my retreat were &s;uch as heightened my abhorrence of my&s;elf; for I was not &s;o far abandoned as to &s;ink voluntarily into corruption, or endeavour to conceal from my own mind the enormity of my crime.</P>
<P>MY relation remitted none of his fond|ne&s;s, but vi&s;ited me &s;o often that I was &s;ome|times afraid le&s;t his a&s;&s;iduity &s;hould expo&s;e him to &s;u&s;picion. Whenever he came he found me weeping, and was therefore le&s;s delight|fully entertained than he expected. After fre|quent expo&s;tulations upon the unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of my &s;orrow, and innumerable prote&s;ta|tions of everla&s;ting regard, he at la&s;t found that I was more affected with the lo&s;s of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, than the danger of my fame, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> not be di&s;turbed by my remor&s;e,
<PB N="295" REF="296">
began to lull my con&s;cience with the opiates of irreligion. His arguments were &s;uch as my cour&s;e of life has &s;ince expo&s;ed me often to the nece&s;&s;ity of hearing, vulgar, empty and fallacious; yet they at fir&s;t confounded me by their novelty, filled me with doubt and per|plexity, and interrupted that peace which I began to feel from the &s;incerity of my repen|tance without &s;ub&s;tituting any other &s;upport. I li&s;tened a while to his impious gabble, but its influence was &s;oon over-powered by natural rea&s;on and early education, and the convic|tions which this new attempt gave me of his ba&s;ene&s;s compleated my abhorrence. I have heard of barbarians, who, when tempe&s;ts drive &s;hips upon their coa&s;t, decoy them to the rocks that they may plunder their lading, and have always thought that wretches thus merci|le&s;s in their depredations, ought to be de&s;troyed by a general in&s;urrection of all &s;ocial beings; yet how light is this guilt to the crime of him, who in the agitations of remor&s;e cuts away the anchor of piety, and when he has drawn a&s;ide credulity from the paths of virtue, hides the light of heaven which would direct her to return. I had hitherto con&s;idered him as a man equally betrayed with my&s;elf by the con|currence
<PB N="296" REF="297">
of appetite and opportunity; but I now &s;aw with horror that he was contriving to perpetuate his gratification, and was de&s;irous to fit me to his purpo&s;e by complete and radical corruption.</P>
<P>TO e&s;cape however, was not yet in my power. I could &s;upport the expences of my condition, only by the continuance of his favour. He provided all that was nece&s;&s;ary, and in a few weeks, congratulated me upon my e&s;cape from the danger which we had both expected with &s;o much anxiety. I then began to remind him of his promi&s;e to re&s;tore me with my fame uninjured to the world. He promi&s;ed me in general terms, that nothing &s;hould be wanting which his power could add to my happine&s;s, but forbore to relea&s;e me from from my confinement. I knew how much my reception in the world depended upon my &s;peedy return, and was therefore outragiou&s;ly impatient of his delays, which I now perceived to be only artifices of lewd|ne&s;s. He told me at la&s;t, with an appearance of &s;orrow, that all hopes of re&s;toration to my former &s;tate were for ever precluded; that
<PB N="297" REF="298">
chance had di&s;covered my &s;ecret and malice divulged it, and that nothing now remained, but to &s;eek a retreat more private, where curio&s;ity or hatred could never find us.</P>
<P>THE rage, angui&s;h, and re&s;entment, which I felt at this account, are not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I was in &s;o much dread of reproach and infamy, which he repre&s;ented as pur&s;uing me with full cry, that I yielded my&s;elf implicitly to his di&s;po&s;al, and was removed with a thou&s;and &s;tudied precautions through by-ways and dark pa&s;&s;ages, to another hou&s;e, where I harra&s;&s;ed him with perpetual &s;olicitations for a &s;mall annuity, that might enable me to live in the country with ob&s;curity and innocence.</P>
<P>THIS demand he at fir&s;t evaded with ardent profe&s;&s;ions, but in time appeared offended at my importunity and di&s;tru&s;t; and having one day endeavoured to &s;ooth me with uncommon expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, when he &s;ound my di&s;content immoveable, left me with &s;ome inarticulate murmurs of anger. I was plea&s;ed that he was at la&s;t rou&s;ed to &s;en&s;ibility, and ex|pecting that at his next vi&s;it, he would comply with my reque&s;t, lived with great
<PB N="298" REF="299">
tranquillity upon the money in my hands, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with this pau&s;e of per|&s;ecution, that I did not reflect how much his ab&s;ence had exceeded the u&s;ual intervals, till I was alarmed with the danger of wanting &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I then &s;uddenly contracted my expences, but was unwilling to &s;upplicate for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Nece&s;&s;ity, however, &s;oon over|came my mode&s;ty or my pride, and I applied to him by a letter, but had no an&s;wer. I writ in terms more pre&s;&s;ing, but without effect. I then &s;ent an agent to enquire after him, who informed me, that he had quitted his hou&s;e, and was gone with his family to re&s;ide for &s;ome time upon his e&s;tate in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER &s;hocked at this abrupt departure, I was yet unwilling to believe that he could wholly abandon me, and therefore by the &s;ale of my cloaths I &s;upported my&s;elf, ex|pecting that every po&s;t would bring me relief. Thus I pa&s;&s;ed &s;even months between hope and dejection, in a gradual approach to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, emaciated with di&s;content and bewildered with uncertainty. At la&s;t, my landlady, after many hints of the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="299" REF="300">
of a new lover, took the opportunity of my ab&s;ence to &s;earch my boxes, and mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome of my apparel, &s;eized the remainder for rent, and led me to the door.</P>
<P>TO remon&s;trate again&s;t legal cruelty, was vain; to &s;upplicate obdurate brutality, was hopele&s;s. I went away I knew not whither, and wandered about without any &s;ettled pur|po&s;e, unacquainted with the u&s;ual expedients of mi&s;ery, unqualified for laborious offices, afraid to meet an eye that had &s;een me be|fore, and hopele&s;s of relief from tho&s;e who were &s;trangers to my former condition. Night came on in the mid&s;t of my di&s;traction, and I &s;till continued to wander till the menaces of the watch obliged me to &s;helter my &s;elf in a covered pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>NEXT day, I procured a lodging in the backward garret of a mean hou&s;e, and em|ployed my landlady to enquire for a &s;ervice. My applications were generally rejected for want of a character. At length, I was re|ceived at a draper's; but when it was known to my mi&s;tre&s;s that I had only one gown, and that of &s;ilk, &s;he was of opinion, that I
<PB N="300" REF="301">
looked like a thief, and without warning, hurried me away. I then tried to &s;upport my&s;elf by my needle, and by my landlady's recommendation, obtained a little work from a &s;hop, and for three weeks lived without repining; but when my punctuality had gain|ed me &s;o much reputation, that I was tru&s;ted to make up a head of &s;ome value, one of my fellow lodgers &s;tole the lace, and I was obliged to fly from a pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THUS driven again into the &s;treets, I li|ved upon the lea&s;t that could &s;upport me, and at night accommodated my&s;elf under pent|hou&s;es as well as I could. At length I be|came ab&s;olutely pennyle&s;s; and having &s;trol|led all day without &s;u&s;tenance, was at the clo&s;e of evening acco&s;ted by an elderly man, with an invitation to a tavern. I refu&s;ed him with he&s;itation; he &s;eized me by the hand, and drew me into a neighbouring hou&s;e, where when he &s;aw my face pale with hun|ger, and my eyes &s;welling with tears, he &s;purned me from him, and bad me cant and whine in &s;ome other place; he for his part would take care of his pockets.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="302">
I STILL continued to &s;tand in the way, having &s;carcely &s;trength to walk farther, when another &s;oon addre&s;&s;ed me in the &s;ame man|ner. When he &s;aw the &s;ame tokens of cala|mity, he con&s;idered that I might be obtained at a cheap rate, and therefore quickly made overtures, which I had no longer firmne&s;s to reject. By this man I was maintained four months in penurious wickedne&s;s, and then abandoned to my former condition from which I was delivered by another keeper.</P>
<P>IN this abject &s;tate I have now pa&s;&s;ed four years, the drudge of extortion and the &s;port of drunkenne&s;s; &s;ometimes the property of one man, and &s;ometimes the common prey of ac|cidental lewdne&s;s; at one time tricked up for &s;ale by the mi&s;tre&s;s of a brothel, at ano|ther begging in the &s;treets to be relieved from hunger by wickedne&s;s; without any hope in the day but of finding &s;ome whom folly or exce&s;s may expo&s;e to my allurements, and without any reflections at night, but &s;uch as guilt and terror impre&s;s upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="303">
IF tho&s;e who pa&s;s their days in plenty and &s;ecurity, could vi&s;it for an hour the di&s;mal receptacles to which the pro&s;titute retires from her nocturnal excur&s;ions, and &s;ee the wretches that lie crowded together, mad with intemperance, gha&s;tly with famine, nau&s;eous with filth, and noi&s;ome with di&s;ea&s;e; it would not be ea&s;y for any degree of abhorrence to harden them again&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, or to repre&s;s the de&s;ire which they mu&s;t immediately feel to re&s;cue &s;uch numbers of human beings from a &s;tate &s;o dreadful.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid that in <HI>France</HI> they annually eva|cuate their &s;treets, and &s;hip their pro&s;titutes and vagabonds to their colonies. If the wo|men that infe&s;t this city had the &s;ame oppor|tunity of e&s;caping from their mi&s;eries, I be|lieve very little force would be nece&s;&s;ary; for who among them can dread any change? Many of us indeed are wholly unqualified for any but the mo&s;t &s;ervile employments, and tho&s;e perhaps would require the care of a magi&s;trate to hinder them from following the &s;ame practices in another country; but others are only precluded by infamy from reforma|tion,
<PB N="303" REF="304">
and would gladly be delivered on any terms from the nece&s;&s;ity of guilt and the ty|ranny of chance. No place but a populous city can afford opportunities for open pro&s;ti|tution, and where the eye of ju&s;tice can at|tend to individuals, tho&s;e who cannot be made good may be re&s;trained from mi&s;chief. For my part I &s;hould exult at the privilege of bani&s;h|ment, and think my&s;elf happy in any region that &s;hould re&s;tore me once again to hone&s;ty and peace.</P>

<P>NOTHING has been longer ob&s;erved, than that a change of fortune cau&s;es a change of manners; and that it is difficult to conjecture from the conduct of him whom we &s;ee in a low condition, how he would act, if wealth and power were put into his hands. But it is generally agreed, that few men are made better by affluence or exalta|tion; and that the powers of the mind, when they are unbound and expanded by the &s;un|&s;hine of felicity, more frequently luxuriate into follies, than blo&s;&s;om into goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>MANY ob&s;ervations have concurred to e&s;|tabli&s;h this opinion, and it is not likely &s;oon to become ob&s;olete, for want of new occa&s;ions to revive it. The greater part of mankind are corrupt in every condition, and differ in
<PB N="305" REF="306">
high and in low &s;tations, only as they have more or fewer opportunities of gratifying their de&s;ires, or as they are more or le&s;s re|&s;trained by human cen&s;ures. Many vitiate their principles in the acqui&s;ition of riches; and who can wonder that what is gained by fraud and extortion is enjoyed with tyranny and exce&s;s?</P>
<P>YET I am willing to believe that the de|pravation of the mind by external advanta|ges, though certainly not uncommon, yet approaches not &s;o nearly to univer&s;ality, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;erted in the bitterne&s;s of re&s;ent|ment, or heat of declamation.</P>
<P>WHOEVER ri&s;es above tho&s;e who once plea&s;ed them&s;elves with equality, will have many malevolent gazers at his eminence. To gain &s;ooner than others that which all pur&s;ue with the &s;ame ardour, and to which all imagine them&s;elves entitled, will for ever be a crime. When tho&s;e who &s;tarted with us in the race of life, leave us &s;o far behind, that we have little hope to overtake them, we revenge our di&s;appointment by remarks on the arts of &s;upplantation by which they
<PB N="306" REF="307">
gained the advantage, or on the folly and ar|rogance with which they po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Of them, who&s;e ri&s;e we could not hinder, we &s;olace our&s;elves by progn o&s;ticating the fall.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for human purity not to betray to an eye thus &s;harpened by malignity, &s;ome &s;tains which lay concealed and unre|garded while none thought it their intere&s;t to di&s;cover them; nor can the mo&s;t circum&s;pect attention or &s;teady rectitude, e&s;cape blame from cen&s;ors, who have no inclination to ap|prove. Riches therefore perhaps do not &s;o often produce crimes as incite accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>THE common charge again&s;t tho&s;e who ri&s;e above their original condition, is that of pride. It is certain, that &s;ucce&s;s naturally confirms us in a favourable opinion of our own abilities. Scarce any man is willing to allot to accident, friend&s;hip, and a thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which concur in every event without human contrivance or interpo&s;ition, the part which they may ju&s;tly claim in his advance|ment. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> our&s;elves by our fortune ra|ther than our virtues, and exorbitant claims are quickly produced by imaginary merit. But
<PB N="307" REF="308">
captiou&s;ne&s;s and jealou&s;y are likewi&s;e ea&s;ily offended, and to him who &s;tudiou&s;ly looks for an affront, every mode of behaviour will &s;upply it; freedom will be rudene&s;s, and re|&s;erve fullenne&s;s; mirth will be negligence, and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s formality: when he is recei|ved with ceremony, di&s;tance and re&s;pect are inculcated; if he is treated with familiarity, he concludes him&s;elf in&s;ulted by &s;tudied con|de&s;cen&s;ions.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed that as all &s;udden changes are dangerous, a quick tran&s;ition from proverty to abundance, can &s;eldom be made with &s;afety. He that has long lived within &s;ight of plea&s;ures, which he could not reach, will need more than common moderation, not to lo&s;e his rea&s;on in unbounded riot, when they are fir&s;t put into his power.</P>
<P>EVERY po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is endeared by novelty; every gratification is exaggerated by de&s;ire. It is difficult not to e&s;timate what is lately gained above its real value; it is impo&s;&s;ible not to annex greater happine&s;s to that condi|tion from which we are unwillingly exclu|ded,
<PB N="308" REF="309">
than nature has qualified us to obtain. For this rea&s;on, the remote inheritor of an unexpected fortune, may be generally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from tho&s;e who are enriched in the common cour&s;e of lineal de&s;cent, by his greater ha&s;te to enjoy his wealth, by the finery of his dre&s;s, the pomp of his equipage, the &s;plendor of his furniture, and the luxury of his table.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND things which familiarity di&s;covers to be of little value, have power for a time to &s;eize the imagination. A <HI>Vir|ginian</HI> king, when the <HI>Europeans</HI> had &s;ixed a lock on his door, was &s;o delighted to find his &s;ubjects admitted or excluded with &s;uch faci|lity, that it was from morning to evening his whole employment to turn the key. We among whom locks and keys have been lon|ger in u&s;e, are inclined to laugh at this <HI>Ame|rican</HI> amu&s;ement; yet I doubt whether this paper will have a &s;ingle reader that may not apply the &s;tory to him&s;elf, and recollect &s;ome hours of his life in which he has been equal|ly overpowered by the tran&s;itory charms of trivial novelty.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="310">
SOME indulgence is due to him whom a happy gale of fortune has &s;uddenly tran&s;port|ed into new regions, where unaccu&s;tomed lu&s;tre dazzles his eyes, and unta&s;ted delica|cies &s;olicit his appetite. Let him not be con&s;idered as lo&s;t in hopele&s;s degeneracy, though he for a while forgets the regard due to others, to indulge the contemplation of him&s;elf, and in the extravagance of his fir&s;t raptures expects that his eye &s;hould regulate the motions of all that approach him, and his opinion be received as deci&s;ive and ora|culous. His intoxication will give way to time; the madne&s;s of joy will fume imper|ceptibly away; the &s;en&s;e of his in&s;ufficiency will &s;oon return; he will remember, that the cooperation of others is nece&s;&s;ary to his hap|pine&s;s, and learn to conciliate their regard by reciprocal beneficence.</P>
<P>There is, at lea&s;t, one con&s;ideration which ought to alleviate our cen&s;ures of the power|ful and rich. He that imagines them charge|able with all the guilt and folly of their own actions, is very little acquainted with the world. <Q><PB N="310" REF="311"><L>De l'ab&s;olu pouvoir vous ignorez l' yvre&s;&s;e,</L>
<L>Et du lache flateur la voix enchantere&s;&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>HE from whom much can be hoped or feared, will not find many whom ambition or cowardice will &s;uffer to be &s;incere, or who cultivate his regard with any other purpo&s;e, than to comply with all his practices howe|ver vitious, and with all his &s;entiments how|ever ab&s;urd. While we live upon the level with the re&s;t of mankind, we are reminded of our duty by the admonitions of friends, and reproaches of enemies; but men who &s;tand in the highe&s;t ranks of &s;ociety, &s;eldom hear of their faults; if by any accident an opprobrious clamour reaches their ears, flat|tery is always at hand to pour in her opiates, to quiet conviction and obtund remor&s;e.</P>
<P>FAVOUR is &s;eldom &s;o certainly gained as by conformity in vice. Virtue can &s;tand without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;iders her&s;elf as very little obliged by countenance and appro|bation; but vice, always timorous, eagerly &s;eeks the &s;helter of crouds, and &s;upport of confederacy. The &s;ycophant therefore, thinks
<PB N="311" REF="312">
it not nece&s;&s;ary to adopt the good qualities of his patron, but employs all his art on his weakne&s;&s;es and follies, regales his reigning vanity, or &s;timulates his prevalent de&s;ire.</P>
<P>VIRTUE is &s;ufficiently difficult in any cir|cum&s;tances, but the difficulty is encrea&s;ed when reproof and advice are frighted away. In common life, rea&s;on and con&s;cience have only the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions to encounter, but in higher &s;tations, they mu&s;t oppo&s;e arti|fice and adulation. He therefore, that yields to &s;uch temptations, cannot give tho&s;e who look upon his mi&s;carriage much rea&s;on for exultation, &s;ince few can ju&s;tly pre&s;ume that from the &s;ame &s;nare they &s;hould have been able to e&s;cape.</P>
