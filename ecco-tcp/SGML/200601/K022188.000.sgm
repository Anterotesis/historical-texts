<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 TIM. IV. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thy Youth.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE author of this epi&s;tle, with many better qualities, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a great degree what we at this day call a <HI>knowledge of the world.</HI> He knew, that although age and honours, authority of &s;tation and &s;plendor of appearance, u&s;ually command the veneration of mankind, unle&s;s coun|teracted by &s;ome degrading vice, or egregious impropriety of behaviour; yet, that where the&s;e advantages are want|ing, where no di&s;tinction can be claimed from rank, im|portance from power, or dignity from years; in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, and under the inevitable depre&s;&s;ion of narrow fortunes, to procure and pre&s;erve re&s;pect requires both care and merit. The apo&s;tle al&s;o knew, and in the text taught his beloved convert, that to obtain the re&s;pect of tho&s;e among&s;t whom he exerci&s;ed his mini&s;try, was an object de|&s;erving the ambition of a Chri&s;tian teacher, not indeed for his own &s;ake, but for theirs, there being little rea&s;on to hope that any would profit by his in&s;truction who de&s;pi&s;ed his per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
If <HI>St. Paul</HI> thought an admonition of this &s;ort worthy of a place in his epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> it cannot &s;urely be deemed either be&s;ide or beneath the &s;olemnity of this occa&s;ion, to deliver a few practicable rules of life and behavior, which may recommend you to the e&s;teem of the people, to who&s;e &s;ervice and &s;alvation you are now about to dedicate your lives and labours.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the &s;tations which you are likely, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, to occupy in the church, although not capable of all the means of rendering &s;ervice and challen|ging re&s;pect, which fall within the power of your &s;uperiors, are free from many prejudices that attend upon higher pre|ferments. Interfering intere&s;ts and di&s;puted rights; or where there is no place for di&s;pute, the very claim and re|ception of legal dues, &s;o long as what is received by the mini&s;ter is taken from the pari&s;hioner, form oftentimes an almo&s;t in&s;uperable ob&s;truction to the be&s;t endeavours that can be u&s;ed to conciliate the good will of a neighbourhood. The&s;e difficulties perplex not <HI>you.</HI> In whatever conte&s;ts with his pari&s;hioners the <HI>principal</HI> may be engaged, the <HI>curate</HI> has neither di&s;pute nor demand to &s;tand between him and the affections of his congregation.</P>
<P>Another, and a &s;till more favourable circum&s;tance in your &s;ituation is this; being upon a level with the greate&s;t part of your pari&s;hioners, you gain an acce&s;s to their conver&s;ation and confidence, which is rarely granted to the &s;uperior clergy, without extraordinary addre&s;s and the mo&s;t in&s;inuating
<PB N="5" REF="5">
advances on their parts. And this is a valuable pri|viledge; for it enables you to inform your&s;elves of the mo|ral and religious &s;tate of your flocks, of their wants and weakne&s;&s;es, their habits and opinions, of the vices which prevail, and the principles from which they proceed: in a word, it enables you to &s;tudy the di&s;temper before you apply the remedy; and not only &s;o, but to apply the re|medy in the mo&s;t commodious form, and with the be&s;t ef|fect; by private per&s;ua&s;ion and reproof, by gentle and un|&s;u&s;pected conveyances in the intimacy of friend&s;hip and op|portunities of conver&s;ation. To this mu&s;t be added the many occa&s;ions, which the living in habits of &s;ociety with your pari&s;hioners affords you of reconciling di&s;&s;entions, healing animo&s;ities, admini&s;tring advice to the young and inexperienced, and con&s;olation to age and mi&s;ery. I put you in mind of this advantage, becau&s;e the right u&s;e of it con&s;titutes one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable employments not only of our order, but of human nature: and leaves you, believe me, little to envy in the condition of your &s;uperiors, or to regret in your own. It is true, that this de&s;cription &s;uppo&s;es you to re&s;ide &s;o con&s;tantly, and to continue &s;o long in the &s;ame pari&s;h, as to have formed &s;ome acquaintance with the per&s;ons and characters of your pari&s;hioners; and what &s;cheme of doing good in your profe&s;&s;ion, or even of doing your duty, does not &s;uppo&s;e this?</P>
<P>But whil&s;t I recommend a ju&s;t concern for our reputa|tion, and a proper de&s;ire of public e&s;teem, I would by no means flatter that pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e and popularity, which
<PB N="6" REF="6">
&s;eizes oftentimes the minds of young clergymen, e&s;pecially when their fir&s;t appearance in their profe&s;&s;ion has been re|ceived with more than common approbation. Unfortunate &s;ucce&s;s! if it incite them to &s;eek fame by affectation and hypocri&s;y, or lead, as vanity &s;ometimes does, to enthu&s;ia&s;m and extravagance. This is not the ta&s;te or character I am holding out to your imitation. The popular preacher courts fame for its own &s;ake, or for what he can make of it; the &s;incerely pious mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t mode&s;tly invites e&s;teem, only or principally, that it may lend efficacy to his in&s;truction, and weight to his reproofs; the one &s;eeks to be known and proclaimed abroad, the other is content with the &s;ilent re&s;pect of his neighbourhood, &s;en&s;ible that <HI>that</HI> is the theatre upon which alone his good name can a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the di&s;|charge of his duty.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to caution you again&s;t &s;ome awkward endeavours to lift themselves into importance, which young clergymen not unfrequently fall upon; &s;uch as a conceited way of &s;peaking, new airs and ge&s;tures, af|fected manners, a mimicry of the fa&s;hions, language, and diver&s;ions, or even of the follies and vices of higher life; a hunting after the acquaintance of the great, a cold and di&s;|tant behaviour towards their former equals, and a contemp|tuous neglect of their &s;ociety Nothing was ever gained by the&s;e arts, if they de&s;erve the name of arts, but deri&s;ion and di&s;like&mdash;Po&s;&s;ibly they may not offend again&s;t any rule of moral probity; but if they di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e with whom you are to live, and upon whom the good you do mu&s;t be done,
<PB N="7" REF="7">
they defeat not only their own end, but, in a great mea&s;ure, the very de&s;ign and u&s;e of your vocation.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e few ob&s;ervations, I proceed to de&s;cribe the qualities which principally conduce to the end we have at pre&s;ent in view, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fair and re|&s;pected character.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t virtue (for &s;o I will call it) which appears to me of importance for this purpo&s;e, is <HI>frugality.</HI> If there be a &s;ituation in the world in which profu&s;ion is without excu&s;e, it is in that of a young clergyman who has little be&s;ide his profe&s;&s;ion to depend upon for his &s;upport. It is folly&mdash;it is ruin&mdash;Folly, for whether it aim at luxury, or &s;how, it mu&s;t fall mi&s;erably &s;hort of its de&s;ign. In the&s;e competitions we are outdone by every rival. The provi&s;ion which clergymen meet with upon their entrance into the church is adequate in mo&s;t ca&s;es to the wants and decencies of their &s;ituation, but to nothing more.&mdash;To pretend to more, is to &s;et up our poverty not only as the &s;ubject of con|&s;tant ob&s;ervation, but as a laughing &s;tock to every ob&s;erver. Profu&s;ion is ruin: for it ends, and &s;oon too, in debt, in in|ju&s;tice, and in&s;olvency. You well know how meanly, in the country more e&s;pecially, every man is thought of who cannot pay his credit; in what terms he is &s;poken of&mdash;in what light he is viewed, what a deduction this is from his good qualities, what an aggravation of his bad ones&mdash;what in&s;ults he is expo&s;ed to from his creditors, what con|tempt from all. Nor is this judgement far ami&s;s. Let him
<PB N="8" REF="8">
not &s;peak of hone&s;ty, who is daily practicing deceit; for every man who is not paid is deceived. Let him not talk of liberality, who puts it out of his power to perform one act of it.&mdash;Let him not boa&s;t of &s;pirit, of honour, of in|dependence, who fears the face of his creditors, and who meets a creditor in every &s;treet. There is no meanne&s;s in frugality: the meanne&s;s is in tho&s;e &s;hifts and expedients, to which extravagance is &s;ure to bring men. Profu&s;ion is a very equivocal proof of genero&s;ity. The proper di&s;tinction is not between him who &s;pends and him who &s;aves; for they may be equally &s;elfi&s;h; but between him who &s;pends upon him&s;elf, and him who &s;pends, upon others. When I extol frugality, it is not to prai&s;e that minute par&s;imony which &s;erves for little but to vex our&s;elves and teize tho&s;e about us; but to per&s;uade you to <HI>oeconomy upon a plan,</HI> and that plan deliberately adju&s;ted to your circum&s;tances and expectations. Set out with it, and it is ea&s;y; to retrieve, out of a &s;mall income, is only not impo&s;&s;iible. Frugality in this &s;en&s;e, we preach not only as an article of prudence, but as a le&s;&s;on of virtue. Of this frugality it has been truly &s;aid, that it is the parent of liberty, of independence, of genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>A &s;econd e&s;&s;ential part of a clergyman's character, is <HI>&s;o|briety.</HI> In the &s;cale of human vices there may be &s;ome more criminal than drunkene&s;s, but none &s;o humiliating. A clergyman cannot, without infinite confu&s;ion, produce him&s;elf in the pulpit before tho&s;e who have been witne&s;&s;es to his intemperance. The folly and extravagance, the rage
<PB N="9" REF="9">
and ribaldry, the boa&s;ts and quarrels, the idioti&s;m and bru|tality of that condition, will ri&s;e up in their imaginations in full colours. To di&s;cour&s;e of temperance, to touch in the remote&s;t degree upon the &s;ubject, is but to revive his own &s;hame. For you will &s;oon have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who are the &s;lowe&s;t in taking any part of a &s;ermon to them&s;elves, are &s;urprizingly acute in applying it to the preacher.</P>
<P>Another vice, which there is the &s;ame together with many additional rea&s;ons for guarding you again&s;t, is <HI>di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s.</HI> In my judgement, the crying &s;in and calamity of this country at pre&s;ent, is licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes. It is a vice which hardly admits of argument or di&s;&s;ua&s;ion. It can only be encountered by the cen&s;ures of the good, and the di&s;couragement it receives from the mo&s;t re&s;pected orders of the community. What then &s;hall we &s;ay, when they who ought to cure the malady, propagate the contagion. Upon this &s;ubject bear away one ob&s;ervation, that when you &s;uffer your&s;elves to be engaged in any un|cha&s;te connexion, you not only corrupt an individual by your &s;ollicitations, but debauch a whole neighbourhood by the profligacy of your example.</P>
<P>The habit I will next recommend as the foundation of almo&s;t all other good ones, is retirement. Were I required to comprize my advice to young clergymen in one &s;entence it &s;hould be in this, learn to live alone. Half of your faults originate from the want of this faculty. It is impatience of
<PB N="10" REF="10">
&s;olitude which carries you continually from your pari&s;hes, your home, and your duty; makes you foremo&s;t in every party of plea&s;ure and place of diver&s;ion; di&s;&s;ipates your thoughts, di&s;tracts your &s;tudies, leads you into expence, keeps you in di&s;tre&s;s, puts you out of humour with your profe&s;|&s;ion, cau&s;es you to place your&s;elves at the head of &s;ome low company, or to fa&s;ten your&s;elves as de&s;picable retainers to the hou&s;es and &s;ociety of the rich. Whatever may be the ca&s;e with tho&s;e, who&s;e fortunes and opportunities can command a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of company, in &s;ituations like ours to be able to pa&s;s our time with &s;atisfaction alone, and at home, is not only a pre&s;ervative of character, but the very &s;ecret of happine&s;s. Do what we will, we mu&s;t be much and often by our&s;elves; if this be irk&s;ome, the main portions of life will be unhappy. Be&s;ides which, we are not the le&s;s qualified for &s;ociety, becau&s;e we are able to live without it. Our company will be the more welcome for being never obtruded. It is with this, as with many plea&s;ures, he meets with it the oftene&s;t, and enjoys it the be&s;t, who can mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with the want of it.</P>
<P>But what, you &s;ay, &s;hall I do alone? reading is my pro|per occupation and my plea&s;ure, but books are out of my reach, and beyond my purcha&s;e. They who make this com|plaint are &s;uch as &s;eek nothing from books but amu&s;ement, and find amu&s;ement in none but works of narrative or imagina|tion. This ta&s;te, I allow, cannot be &s;upplied by any mo|derate expence or ordinary opportunities: but apply your|&s;elves to &s;tudy; take in hand any branch of u&s;eful &s;cience,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
e&s;pecially of tho&s;e parts of it which are &s;ub&s;idiary to the knowledge of religion, and a few books will &s;uffice; for in&s;tance, a commentary upon the new te&s;tament read &s;o as to be remembred, will employ a great deal of lei&s;ure, very profitably. There is likewi&s;e another re&s;ource, which you have forgot, I mean the compo&s;ition of &s;ermons. I am far from refu&s;ing you the benefit of other men's la|bours; I only require that they be called in not to flatter lazine&s;s, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t indu&s;try. You find your&s;elf unable to furni&s;h a &s;ermon every week, try to compo&s;e one every month: depend upon it you will con&s;ult your own &s;atsfaction, as well as the edification of your hearers; and that however in&s;erior your compo&s;itions may be to tho&s;e of others in &s;ome re&s;pects, they will be better delivered, and better received; they will compen&s;ate for many defects by a clo&s;er appli|cation to the ways and manners, the actual thoughts, rea&s;on|ing and language, the errors, doubts, prejudices and vices, the habits, characters, and propen&s;ities of your congregation, than can be expected from borrowed di&s;cour&s;es&mdash;at any rate you are pa&s;&s;ing your time virtuou&s;ly and honourably.</P>
<P>With retirement, I connect re&s;erve; by which I mean, in the fir&s;t place, &s;ome degree of delicacy in the choice of your company, and of refinement in your plea&s;ures. Above all things keep out of public hou&s;es&mdash;you have no bu&s;ine&s;s there&mdash;your being &s;een to go in and out of them is di&s;|graceful&mdash;your pre&s;ence in the&s;e places entitles every man who meets you there, to affront you by coar&s;e je&s;ts, by indecent or opprobrious topics of conver&s;ation&mdash;Neither be
<PB N="12" REF="12">
&s;een at drunken fea&s;ts, boi&s;terous &s;ports, late hours, or bar|barous diver&s;ions&mdash;Let your amu&s;ements, like every thing about you, be &s;till and quiet and unoffending. Carry the &s;ame re&s;erve into your corre&s;pondence with your &s;u|periors. Pur&s;ue preferment, if any pro&s;pects of it pre&s;ent them&s;elves, not only by honourable means, but with mo|derate anxiety. It is not e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s, perhaps not very conducive&mdash;were it of greater importance than it is, no more &s;ucce&s;sful rule could be given you, than to do your duty quietly and contentedly, and to let things take their cour&s;e. You may have been brought up with different notions, but be a&s;&s;ured, that for once that preferment is for|feited by mode&s;ty, it is ten times lo&s;t by intru&s;ion and im|portunity&mdash;Every one &s;ympathi&s;es with neglected merit, but who &s;hall lament over repul&s;ed impudence?</P>
<P>The la&s;t expedient I &s;hall mention, and in conjunction with the others a very efficacious one towards engaging re|&s;pect, is &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in your deportment, e&s;pecially in di&s;|charging the offices of your profe&s;&s;ion. Salvation, is &s;o awful a concern, that no human being, one would think, could be plea&s;ed with &s;eeing it, or any thing belonging to it, treated with levity. For a moment, in a certain &s;tate of the &s;pirits, men may divert them&s;elves, or affect to be di|verted, by &s;porting with their mo&s;t &s;acred intere&s;ts; but no one in his heart derides religion long&mdash;what are we&mdash;any of us?&mdash;religion will &s;oon be our only care and friend. Se|riou&s;ne&s;s therefore in a clergyman is agreeable, not only to the &s;erious, but to men of all tempers and de&s;criptions. And
<PB N="13" REF="13">
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is enough: a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance, a melo|dious voice, a graceful delivery, are indeed enviable ac|compli&s;hments; but much we apprehend, may be done without them. The great point is to be thought in ear|ne&s;t. Seem not then to be brought to any part of your duty by con&s;traint, to perform it with reluctance, to go through it in ha&s;te, or to quit it with &s;ymptoms of delight. In reading the &s;ervices of the church, provided you mani|fe&s;t a con&s;cienciou&s;ne&s;s of the meaning and importance of what you are about, and betray no contempt of your duty, or of your congregation, your manner cannot be too plain and &s;imple. Your common method of &s;peaking, if it be not too low, or too rapid, do not alter, or only &s;o much as to be heard di&s;tinctly. I mention this, becau&s;e your elocu|tion is more apt to offend by &s;training and &s;tiffne&s;s, than on the &s;ide of ea&s;e and familiarity. The &s;ame plainne&s;s and &s;implicity which I recommend in the delivery, prefer al&s;o in the &s;tyle and compo&s;ition of your &s;ermons. Ornaments, or even accuracy of language, co&s;t the writer much trouble, and produce &s;mall advantage to the hearer. Let the cha|racter of your &s;ermons be truth and information and <HI>a de|cent particularity</HI>&mdash;Propo&s;e one point in one di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;tick to it; a hearer never carries away more than one im|pre&s;&s;ion&mdash;di&s;dain not the old fa&s;hion of dividing your &s;er|mons into heads&mdash;in the hands of a ma&s;ter, this may be di&s;pen&s;ed with; in yours, a &s;ermon which rejects the&s;e helps to per&s;picuity, will turn out a bewildered rhap&s;ody, without aim or effect, order or conclu&s;ion. In a word, &s;trive to make your di&s;cour&s;es u&s;eful, and they who profit
<PB N="14" REF="14">
by your preaching, will &s;oon learn, and long continue to be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed the enumeration of tho&s;e qualities which are required in the clerical character; and which wherever they meet make even youth venerable, and po|verty re&s;pected; which will &s;ecure e&s;teem under every di&s;|advantage of fortune, per&s;on, and &s;ituation, and notwith|&s;tanding great defects of abilities and attainments. But I mu&s;t not &s;top here: a good name, fragrant and precious as it is, is by us only valued in &s;ub&s;erviency to our duty, in &s;ubordination to a higher reward. If we are more tender of our reputation, if we are more &s;tudious of e&s;teem than others, it is from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that by fir&s;t obtaining the re|&s;pect of our congregation, and next by availing our&s;elves of that re&s;pect, to promote among&s;t them peace and virtue, u&s;eful knowlege and benevolent di&s;po&s;itions, we are pur|cha&s;ing to our&s;elves a rever&s;ion and inheritance valuable above all price, important beyond every other intere&s;t or &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Go then into the vineyard of the go&s;pel, and may the grace of God go with you. The religion you preach is true. Di&s;pen&s;e its ordinances with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, its doctrines with &s;incerity&mdash;urge its precepts, di&s;play its hopes, produce its terrors&mdash;"be &s;ober, be vigilant"&mdash;"have a good re|port"&mdash;confirm the faith of others, te&s;tify and adorn your own, by the virtues of your life and the &s;anctity of your re|putation&mdash;Be peaceable, be courteous; conde&s;cending to
<PB N="15" REF="15">
men of the lowe&s;t condition&mdash;"apt to teach, willing to communicate," &s;o far as the immutable laws of truth and probity will permit, "be every thing unto all men, that ye may gain &s;ome."</P>
<P>The world will requite you with its e&s;teem. The awak|ed &s;inner, the enlightened &s;aint&mdash;the young whom you have trained to virtue, the old whom you have vi&s;ited with the con&s;olations of Chri&s;tianity, &s;hall pur&s;ue you with pre|vailing ble&s;&s;ings, and effectual prayers. You will clo&s;e your lives and mini&s;try with con&s;ciences void of offence, and full of hope.&mdash;To pre&s;ent at the la&s;t day even one recovered &s;oul, reflect how grateful an offering it will be to <HI>him,</HI> who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion was to &s;ave a world&mdash;infinitely, no doubt, but &s;till only in degree, does our office differ from <HI>his</HI>&mdash;him&s;elf the fir&s;t born, it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life, the merit of his death, the council of his father's love, the exerci&s;e and con&s;ummation of his own, "to bring many brethren unto glory."</P>
