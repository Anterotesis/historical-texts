LETTER
TO THE
Writer of a Letter to my Lord <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Occa&s;ion'd
by a Letter to the Publi&s;her of
the pre&s;ent Edition of the <HI>Dunciad Vario|rum.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> has now oblig'd him&s;elf, and is
perfectly happy in beholding his illu&s;trious Brat, the ju&s;t Sem|blance
of his &s;weet temper'd Parent, make his Appearance:
He had long promis'd, or rather threaten'd the Publick with this Edi|tion;
but Nobody would believe, that any Creature could be hardy,
or vain, or wicked enough, to undertake to utter a virulent Lampoon,
with the Names of many worthy Per&s;ons at full Length; but it &s;eems,
the Raneour of his Mind has got the better of his Fears, and the Itch
of Scribling is much &s;uperior to the Dread of Cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>Well then, having (like <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>) written his own Commentaries, and
given him&s;elf various Readings upon him&s;elf, having guarded him&s;elf
on all Sides, and &s;urrounded his Text with <HI>Prolegomena, Te&s;timonia,</HI>
<HI>Arguments, Indexes, Appendix, &amp;c.</HI> and adorn'd him&s;elf with all the
Pomp and Trappings that u&s;ually attend the Dignity of an e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Writer of Antiquity: Behold him &s;trutting into the World, and ex|pecting
to receive the Reverence due to his Quality, <HI>Optat Ephippia Mus,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="7">
and however awkardly they become him, he rejoices in them. Behold
him now proclaiming him&s;elf a Cla&s;&s;ick; behold a Per&s;onage whom he
&s;tiles <HI>William Cleland,</HI> walking gravely before our Poetical Dictator, bare
Headed, with the Fa&s;ces on his Shoulder; and a little behind him, an
ugly Northern Thing, formerly his Colleague in Scandal and Critici&s;m,
an odd Mixture of <HI>Doctor, Poet, Buffoon, Pun&s;ter, Politician, Antiqua|ry,</HI>
and <HI>Cook</HI>; methinks I &s;ee them now marching in &s;olemn Parade,
round the new created Cla&s;&s;ick's Garden at <HI>Twickenham</HI>; I hear them
repeating the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and the neighbouring Shores re&s;ound his Ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Yet has not the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>'s Vanity outrun his Judgment
&s;o many Lengths, to per&s;uade him to &s;et his own Name to this mode&s;t
Performance; therefore has he borrow'd, and very properly, the Name
of <HI>Martinus Scriblerus</HI>; and not content with this, or apprehen&s;ive this
was not a &s;ufficient Protection for him, he has publi&s;h'd a Letter to his
Publi&s;her, and &s;ign'd it <HI>William Cleland.</HI></P>
<P>I have many Rea&s;ons which induce me to believe, that this Friend
of <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s, whom he calls <HI>William Cleland,</HI> is a counterfeit Friend
only, and the Words &s;tand like <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> and <HI>John Doe,</HI> for Form
Sake only, in a Recovery, and to give the Mode&s;t Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
an Opportunity of &s;aying &s;omething pretty in his own Favour. Mr.
<HI>Congreve,</HI> in his <HI>Way of the World,</HI> &s;hews us a Coxcomb, who u&s;ed to
enquire for him&s;elf at a Chocolate-hou&s;e, and not finding him&s;elf there,
would leave Letters for him&s;elf: But our little merry Author goes far|ther;
he prints Letters to him&s;elf, writes Libels, threatens, forgives,
puni&s;hes, and is really the <HI>Drawcan&s;ir</HI> of the Age.</P>
<P>In the Publi&s;her's Preface, (for <HI>our Cla&s;&s;ick</HI> gives us a Publi&s;her's Pre|face,
as well as a Preface to the Publi&s;her) he takes upon him to an|&s;wer
for Po&s;terity, and very mode&s;tly a&s;&s;ures us, that this in&s;ipid Poem
will be read by Po&s;terity: The&s;e are his Words, <HI>In this Monument they mu&s;t
expect to &s;urvive</HI> (<HI>And here &s;urvive they &s;hall,</HI> (Oh dreadful!) <HI>as long as
the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Tongue &s;hall remain &s;uch as it was in the Reigns of Queen</HI> Anne
<HI>and King</HI> George.) If this Pigmy Animal's Wit could come up to his
Malice, what Work would he make with tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;o unhappy
to fall under his Di&s;plea&s;ure! But as it is, if this Monument, as he calls
it, &s;hould la&s;t; let the pre&s;ent Age inform him, and hereby it does in|form
him, that it will &s;tand only as a Monument of his Infamy; and
tho&s;e that come after us will and mu&s;t believe, the Per&s;ons who &s;tood
the Marks of his petulant Malice, to be Worthy and Good Men; and
the Enemies of the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> will be always look'd
upon as the Friends of Virtue; they will &s;ee a little invidious narrow
<PB N="3" REF="8">
Mind in every Line he has written; they will blu&s;h at his indecent
Idaeas, and be &s;hock'd at his Scurrility. Therefore I applaud your De&s;ign,
Sir, of printing your Letter in Quarto, exactly on the &s;ame Size with
that of the <HI>Dunciad Variorum</HI>; let it be bound up with it; let them
cling together through every Age; there the Author of the <HI>Dunciad
&s;hall &s;urvive, and &s;urvive he &s;hall &mdash; As long as the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Tongue
&s;hall remain &s;uch as it was in the Reigns of Queen</HI> Anne, <HI>and King</HI> George.
If this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, What Courage, what Allies, what Stature
mu&s;t future Ages conceive this Giant Warriour to be aided with? They
will imagine him at lea&s;t to be Seven Foot high, beyond the Growth
of his Cotemporaries, both in Stature and Under&s;tanding. Will they
not be &s;urprized, when I a&s;&s;ure them, and I do hereby a&s;&s;ure them, (for
I, Sir, put in my Claim to Immortality too, by being annexed to you)
that this &s;ame Gyant, was but about four Foot and an Half high, of a
Structure a little irregular, and his Genius Low and indecent as his
Form.</P>
<P>But I lo&s;e my Purpo&s;e, which was to &s;hew the Improbability that any
Man &s;hould be &s;o weak or unadvis'd, or hungry after any Sort of Fame
to &s;o mean a Degree, to place, or &s;uffer his Name to be placed before a
leud and infamous Libel; therefore I &s;ay, This &s;ame Author has written
a Letter to him&s;elf in the Name of one <HI>William Cleland,</HI> and made him
to commend and applaud the Author, for what every one knows he
is liable by the Laws of the Land to be puni&s;h'd when he &s;hall
be di&s;covered; and for this Cau&s;e, at the &s;ame Time that he has plac'd
every Gentleman's Name whom he has abu&s;ed at full Length, he has not
dared to &s;ub&s;cribe his own.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual for the Merry Andrew after he has play'd over his arch
Tricks for &s;ome Time, to put on a grave Face, to rectify his Mu&s;cles,
and to harangue his Audience in a more &s;ober Wi&s;e, to prepare them to
receive the Doctor with Re&s;pect; and this is always done in a prefatory
Way, before the Doctor produces his Medals, or his Pacquets, or pro|ceeds
to poi&s;on him&s;elf or the Company. Our Doctor of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
has thought it proper, it &s;eems, that &s;omebody &s;hould for Form &s;ake take
upon him this Character; and if he has not made his &s;uppo&s;ed Friend
to ri&s;e to the Dignity of his <HI>Zany,</HI> he may at lea&s;t be allowed to
be the Vinegar of the Ring, and be qualified to whip the People into
a Circle before the Sports begin. As the Character of this <HI>W. C.</HI>
thus drawn by the Libeller, is of a very uncommon Kind, I will
give it you in &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon this merry Letter of the
Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> in the Name of this <HI>W. C.</HI> to the Publi&s;her
<PB N="4" REF="9">
of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>; that is, to Nobody, it having been never publickly
&s;old when he wrote his Letter: So that here is one <HI>W. C.</HI> whom
Nobody ever heard of, writing to a certain Publi&s;her, whom No|body
knew.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Author &s;ays, in the Name of <HI>W. C.</HI> that it was a
Mark of his Humanity to &s;tay &s;o long before he executed his Vengeance
upon tho&s;e who had offended him: Now, as Nobody knows better
than he, the Strength and Bitterne&s;s of his own Gall, Nobody can
a&s;&s;ure us &s;o well as he, how long Malice will keep alive, fifteen or
twenty Years at lea&s;t it &s;eems; but now as this Humanity of his
(as he is pleas'd to call it) would be a very dangerous Plea at the
<HI>Old Baily</HI> in an Indictment for the de&s;troying a Man's Per&s;on, I
think it &s;hould weigh as little with the Candid, in ju&s;tifying the De|&s;truction
of a Man's Reputation.</P>
<P>But he makes his <HI>William Cleland</HI> a Party to his Crime likewi&s;e,
and declares he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in compo&s;ing the Libel: He makes him
affirm, he was obliged to it in Humanity, for, &s;ays he, very gravely,
<HI>It was an Orphan</HI>; an <HI>Orphan</HI> Libel. Libels are all Orphans, dear
<HI>William Cleland,</HI> a Sort of Children whom their Fathers never care
to own, and though your Humanity may be very great, I think
in this Ca&s;e your Prudence will hardly weight again&s;t it; there are
very good Rea&s;ons why this &s;ame Author does not own his Child;
and if you knew or con&s;ider'd them, &s;ure you would not thru&s;t
your Ears into the Di&s;pute; but I forget that this <HI>W. C.</HI> is only
an <HI>Ens Rationis,</HI> a Man of Straw, &s;et up by the candid Author of
the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to combat for him.</P>
<P>Immediately after this, our Libeller forgot what he ju&s;t before af|firm'd,
and makes this very <HI>W. C.</HI> to &s;ay, He has found out the
Father of the Ba&s;tard; he makes him mo&s;t impudently to declare
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Author: If he means, as I hope he does not,
the Poet of that Name, who has been &s;o much oblig'd by the Pub|lick,
who is, or ought to be by his Education, a Gentleman, whom
Books ought to have taught Humanity, and polite Conver&s;ation and
Letters, Decency and good Manners; what does this infamous Au|thor
de&s;erve for making his <HI>W. C.</HI> abu&s;e him in this Manner. But
the Rea&s;ons he gives why he conceives Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Author, are
equally &s;currilous and ridiculous. <HI>Every one was curious</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>to read
what could be &s;aid to prove Mr.</HI> Pope <HI>a Dunce, and was ready to pay
&s;omething for &s;uch a Di&s;covery.</HI> How came he to imagine every one
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> curious to find this Gentleman a Dunce; if he knows him to be
<PB N="5" REF="10">
the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> every Man of common Sen&s;e may ea&s;ily
judge what he is; but as the Per&s;on who has written that low and in|famous
Satyr, has not yet dared to &s;et his own Name before it, I
think it did not become this &s;ame <HI>W. C.</HI> whoever he is, to do it for
him. If <HI>W. C.</HI> was a real and not a feign'd Per&s;on, I do not doubt
but Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice for this Abu&s;e, and recur to the
Laws for Satisfaction upon him.</P>
<P>But this Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> whoever he is mu&s;t be a plea|&s;ant
Fellow, for he goes on, and makes his Man of Straw, <HI>W. C.</HI>
declare, that when he &s;aw Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> attack'd or written again&s;t, or
an&s;wer'd by tho&s;e who were abu&s;ed (for he will have him to be his
Author &s;till) that he thought it was become a common Cau&s;e; <HI>the
Danger was common to all, and his Concern ought to be &s;o too</HI>; and
he cau&s;es him very &s;eriou&s;ly to deliver it as his Opinion, That tho&s;e
who <HI>attack'd Mr.</HI> Pope, <HI>mu&s;t be Traitors to Church and State, and Wo|men,</HI>
(&s;trange Stuff) a little venemous Wretch, not Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> is la&s;h'd
for his Ribaldry and his ill Nature; and this Author makes one
<HI>W. C.</HI> without any other Proof but his bare Word, to declare,
<HI>That they have in&s;ulted the Fallen, the Friendle&s;s, the Exil'd, and the
Dead.</HI> It is plain, he would in this Place put his <HI>W. C.</HI> upon us for
one not well affected to our pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment. It is very well
there is no &s;uch Per&s;on as this <HI>W. C.</HI> If there &s;hould be &s;uch a
one, and he &s;hould have a Place under the Government, what Cha|&s;ti&s;ement
would not this low Author merit, for putting the&s;e Words
into his Mouth. We do very well know &s;ome People have <HI>fallen</HI>
in the unhappy Divi&s;ions of our Country (as he gently terms the late
unnatural Rebellion) &s;ome <HI>are Friendle&s;s, &s;ome Exil'd,</HI> and <HI>others Dead,</HI>
and therefore, tho&s;e who have written again&s;t the&s;e People, mu&s;t bear
the La&s;h of our Author's Satyr; if it be true that they have in&s;ulted
the&s;e People, let our Author remember, that they fir&s;t in&s;ulted their
Country and its Laws.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Friend of his goes on, and does now di&s;cover &s;ome Fears
that hang about him, lea&s;t he &s;hould be taken for a Fool or a Knave, by
keeping Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Company; though it luckily happens, that his wri|ting
this Letter has determined his Character; yet he very judiciou&s;ly
conceives, it was his Duty to vindicate him in Print from all Calum|ny,
or to be deemed either the One or the Other; &s;o that ac|cording
to this Notion, all the Acquaintance of Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> are oblig'd
to Print in his Vindication, or to be e&s;teemed Fools or Knaves: Here
the Author puts forth his whole Head.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">
This can only be the over-weening Conceit of a Self-&s;ufficient Writer;
an a&s;&s;uming &s;purious Cla&s;&s;ick, a&s;&s;erting his Supremacy, and demanding
Obedience, as you will &s;ee; for immediately after this, he affects the
Regal Stile; he cau&s;es his <HI>W. C.</HI> to proclaim his Royalty, and ac|cordingly
he i&s;&s;ues his Edicts, That all Offenders again&s;t <HI>him &s;hall be
cha&s;ti&s;ed</HI>: He likens <HI>them</HI> to <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins</HI>; he &s;ays, <HI>Poverty &s;hall not be any
Excu&s;e,</HI> nor <HI>to be pleaded before</HI> him, no more than <HI>at the Old Baily,</HI>
neither &s;hall they, &s;ays he, receive <HI>the Benefit of the Clergy.</HI> But
&s;ome Time after this, his Maje&s;ty cools, he is graciou&s;ly pleas'd to
&s;hew Mercy, and he makes his Herald <HI>W. C.</HI> to grant his <HI>Dunces
a little Bread, and a little Fame.</HI> How ridiculous is it, to &s;ee a di|minutive
&s;trutting Thing, erecting him&s;elf into a Mock-Sovereign:
A mode&s;t <HI>Homuncio,</HI> who at the &s;ame Time that he privately a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inates,
calls tho&s;e whom he wounds, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? But let us con&s;ider
this Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> as he really is, a Per&s;on Poetically mad,
jealous of Fame, and envious of every Rival, gra&s;ping at the &s;malle&s;t
Shadow of Reputation, all his Attention fix'd to one Point, raving
after imaginary Honours, and &s;eeking Infamy in Fame, and we &s;hall
incline to Pity rather than Cen&s;ure. This throws into ones Mind the
Situation of the Mad Taylor in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> who called him&s;elf <HI>Alexan|der
the Great,</HI> was gracious, and bountiful, and ju&s;t, and cruel, and victo|rious,
and good, and bad, as tho&s;e Ideas &s;truck his &s;ick Brain.</P>
<P>By this Time, Sir, you may imagine, I am not a little weary of
raking into this Heap of Non&s;en&s;e and Vanity now before me; but as
I now ca&s;t my Eye forward, I can't help ob&s;erving upon this ima|ginary
Letter Writer, where he tells us, <HI>The Author of the</HI> Dunciad
<HI>has a Contempt for the Writings of tho&s;e he has written again&s;t</HI>:
This is not at all unlikely; One very &s;eldom has a good Opinion
of tho&s;e whom one has an ill Opinion of; <HI>but they are Dunces,
and &s;hould be abu&s;ed for pretending to Wit</HI>: If this be the Ca&s;e, nei|ther
the Great <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> nor <HI>W. C.</HI> nor Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> him&s;elf, are exempt
from the La&s;h of Satyr; for Great, Dignify'd, Letter'd, as they
are, &s;omebody may Print and declare them Dunces, and attempt to
di&s;place this Stupendous Magi&s;trate and all his mad Mini&s;try, who
u&s;urp the Throne of Wit. What a very <HI>Scanderberg</HI> of an Author is
this!</P>
<P><HI>W. C.</HI> I mean the Author of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> in his Name, goes on
and compares <HI>Boileau</HI> to him&s;elf: What has the Great <HI>Boileau</HI> done,
to de&s;erve to be compared with an in&s;ignificant Ribald? But as he is
now concluding his elegant Epi&s;tle, he makes <HI>W. C.</HI> as is u&s;ual in the

Royal Words by <HI>W. C. If ever He</HI> (the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>) <HI>&s;hall give
us an Edition of this Poem him&s;elf, I may &s;ee &s;ome of them treated as
gently</HI> (<HI>on their Repentance and better Mind</HI>) <HI>as</HI> Perault <HI>and</HI> Quinault
<HI>were at la&s;t by</HI> Boileau.</P>
<P>This little bouncing mock Emperor concludes in the Name of <HI>W. C.</HI>
with this &s;ingular Ob&s;ervation on Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s Mode&s;ty, <HI>that he never
wrote a Line, that he was ever a&s;ham'd or unwilling to own.</HI> Now, I
think it is impo&s;&s;ible any Per&s;on but Mr. <HI>P.</HI> him&s;elf can be a&s;&s;ur'd of
this, at lea&s;t, nobody but Mr. <HI>P.</HI> can know that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has no manner of
Grace, or Mode&s;ty, or Morals; and he mu&s;t be a very Blunderer of a
Letter-Writer, who could venture to a&s;&s;ure the Publick &s;o, and in the
Name of one, who pretends to be ambitious of being call'd his Friend.</P>
<P>If now, Sir, after all the Rea&s;ons I have given to the contrary, this
<HI>W. C.</HI> &s;hould happen to be an Exi&s;tence &s;eparate from <HI>Scriblerus</HI> it appears
however, very plainly, from his Manner of Thinking, that he is very
like him, and therefore might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for him. In this Ca&s;e,
we can only &s;ay, that the Pa&s;&s;ion of Friend&s;hip has mi&s;led him, and we
mu&s;t forgive the Weakne&s;s of his Head, for the Warmth of his Heart.
This Prai&s;e-worthy Zeal, for maintaining a Cau&s;e, the Goodne&s;s or Bad|ne&s;s
of which, the Advocate is ab&s;olutely ignorant of, reminds me of a
Story, told me by a very merry old Fellow, who was in his Youth
enroll'd as a private Gentleman in the Life-Guards of King <HI>William</HI>:
He was in E&s;teem with the re&s;t of the Troop, as a <HI>Soldier of Let|ters,</HI>
and was call'd by the Gentlemen of the Belt, by Way of Di|&s;tinction,
<HI>The Schollar.</HI> This Character he bore unrival'd for &s;ome
Time, 'till a Brother of the Sword, grew jealous of his Reputation, and
&s;et up again&s;t him. His Rival, who had been Book-keeper to a
Carrier, (and from thence derived his Title to Letters) took every Op|portunity
of oppo&s;ing him, when any Subject, a little out of the Reach
of the re&s;t of the Company, was &s;tarted. One Evening, my Friend,
in the Height of his Argument, threw out a Sentence of <HI>Tully,</HI> and
was immediately taken up by his Antagoni&s;t for <HI>fal&s;e Latin</HI>; the De|bate
ran high, the Troop divided upon the Point, and yet were un|willing
to determine po&s;itively in a Cau&s;e, into the Merits of which,
they could not &s;ee; 'till one, who was the Book-keeper's Comrade,
a very brave, tho' not a learned Man, pull'd him by the Sleeve,
and leading him into a private Room, directed him to lay his Hand
upon his Heart, and inform him, <HI>upon his Honour,</HI> Whether the
<PB N="8" REF="13">
Words &s;poken, <HI>were true or fal&s;e Latin</HI>? And being an&s;wer'd, upon
his <HI>Honour</HI> they were <HI>fal&s;e Latin</HI>; he return'd immediately into the
Circle of the Warriors they had left, and placing his Hand on his Sword,
declar'd with great Intrepidity, That the <HI>Latin</HI> the Gentleman had
&s;poken, was <HI>fal&s;e Latin,</HI> and he would maintain it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE> <DATELINE><DATE>April the 5th, 1729.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TOGETHER, with the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> I am to return your Lord|&s;hip
many Thanks for the Loan of &s;o uncommon a Piece,
which cannot but be highly welcome to all the true Lovers
of Scandal, &s;ince it leaves them no Room to doubt, as to mo&s;t of the
Per&s;ons libell'd in it. You were pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure me, my Lord,
that it was left at your Hou&s;e by an unknown Hand, and that
you were an utter Stranger both to the Author and to the Nature
of his Performance. It is but rea&s;onable therefore, that I &s;hould &s;a|tisfy
<PB N="10" REF="15">
your Lord&s;hip, as to the&s;e two Particulars, in Return for your
Goodne&s;s in lending me this Book, when I had &s;ought for it in vain,
by the Means of all the Book&s;ellers and Publi&s;hers in Town. It may
not be improper at the &s;ame Time to acquaint you, that Copies have
been left at many Peers Hou&s;es, in the &s;ame Manner as your Lord|&s;hip's
was, whil&s;t the Favourites of the Author have had whole Cargoes
&s;ent them to di&s;po&s;e of. Thus has a little in&s;ignificant Lampooner, with
unparallell'd Impudence, made People of the fir&s;t Quality, privy to,
and &s;ome of them innocently Publi&s;hers of his Scandal; for which,
doubtle&s;s he will be cha&s;ti&s;ed as he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>I find at the Head of this <HI>Libel,</HI> a long &s;tupid Letter, which tho' &s;ub|&s;crib'd
by another Name, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s by <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s, or, which is
the &s;ame Thing, the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>'s Encomium upon him|&s;elf.
He has, I know not with what Intent, brought in the Prai&s;es too
of one Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> maliciou&s;ly in&s;inuating, that this Poem was of his
compo&s;ing, which one would fancy it impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be; for
that Writer, after having acquir'd the Dignity of a <HI>Poet,</HI> would &s;urely
never conde&s;cend to accept of the Office of <HI>Scavenger,</HI> and rake into
all the Filth of the Town. I confe&s;s, I at fir&s;t conceiv'd the Name &s;ub|&s;cribed
to this Letter, to be &s;uch an one as <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> but I have
been &s;ince a&s;&s;ured, that it is no fictitious Name, but the real one of
a Per&s;on now living, who is deeply read in the Indexes of Books
and the Secret Hi&s;tories of Families. Whether this be the Letter-|writer's
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Character or not, the World mu&s;t judge; but this
I will venture to affirm, that as the <HI>Real</HI> Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> can add
no Reputation to this <HI>William Cleland,</HI> &s;o this <HI>William Cleland</HI> can add
no Reputation to the Author of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Should there be any
Thing here like the A&s;&s;ociation between the Lion and the Jackcall, I believe
in this Ca&s;e, the <HI>Jackcall</HI> would prove the <HI>greater Bea&s;t</HI> of the Two:
Not that I would be hereby thought to exclude this Per&s;on from any
Title he may have to the other of the&s;e Appellations. I remember to
have been pre&s;ent at a Trial for a Rape, wherein, the Girl, to prove
her former Cha&s;tity, brought in an old Bawd for her Evidence: Doubt|le&s;s
this Story will admit of no Application in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; but
to u&s;e a Scrap of this Man's own Scrap of <HI>Latin, FASTIDITIS
GRATIAM.</HI></P>
<P>Being then oblig'd to pre&s;ume, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s known Veracity and good
Nature would not admit him to be &s;u&s;pected of having wrote &s;uch an Heap
of Lies and Abu&s;e as is contained in the <HI>Dunciad</HI>; I have u&s;ed my ut|mo&s;t
Endeavours to di&s;cover the true Author of that Poem, and having
<PB N="11" REF="16">
&s;ucceeded in my Re&s;earch, I have prefix'd to this Tract his <HI>Effigies,</HI> as
it has been exactly tran&s;crib'd from a <HI>Bu&s;to,</HI> which was return'd
upon a certain ingenious Sculptor's Hand, for re&s;embling, in a mo&s;t
unflattering Manner, the Original. By the <HI>rueful</HI> Features of it, I am
confident your Lord&s;hip will immediately di&s;cover who is the renown'd
Father of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>You will not, I am &s;ure, expect that I &s;hould enter into an Ex|amination
of the Poetical Merit of that Piece; that would &s;ubject
me to a Ta&s;k, for which I am wholly unfit; I mean, the reading it
a &s;econd Time. But I am well inform'd, that the Reception which
the fir&s;t Edition met with from the Town, &s;hewed that the Perfor|mance
was thought as mean as the De&s;ign. In my cur&s;ory View of
it, tho' I met with &s;ome Lines here and there Poetical enough, yet
I thought the Generality of them very Pro&s;aick, the whole Tale loo&s;e
and unconnected, the Tran&s;itions unnatural, the Parodies on the mo&s;t
admir'd Pa&s;&s;ages of the Ancients, were not only too frequent, but
likewi&s;e too faintly and poorly wrought up, either to &s;trike or de|light
the Reader; and be&s;ides, the Na&s;tine&s;s of the <HI>Games,</HI> and of
all the Imagery in the Poem, the very Language often &s;unk into
downright Ribaldry, as when a <HI>Gentlewomans Brea&s;ts</HI> are &s;tiled her
<HI>Fore-Buttocks</HI> or her <HI>Cow-like Udders.</HI> Upon the whole, I judg'd this
<HI>Dunciad</HI> to be below all Critici&s;m, both as to its Stile and Ver&s;ifi|cation.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Morality of it, as well as of the Notes of <HI>Scriblerus</HI>
and <HI>Variorum,</HI> may de&s;erve a much &s;tricter Scrutiny. Felons in the
Condemn'd Hold at <HI>Newgate,</HI> who have no Characters to forfeit, and
but little Enjoyment of Life to lo&s;e, may venture to attack the Re|putations
of other Men, without Fear or Shame; but, unle&s;s under
tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, none but a Madman could be tempted to do it.
How &s;hall I a&s;toni&s;h your Lord&s;hip then, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that no
de&s;perate Raver, but a poor Reptile; who, as he is the mo&s;t helple&s;s,
is likewi&s;e the mo&s;t timid Creature living, has acted this Part. He
is become a voluntary Pri&s;oner to his own Hou&s;e, rather than not
enjoy the pitiful Plea&s;ure of a&s;per&s;ing with Impunity, Per&s;ons, all of
them better Members of the Community than him&s;elf, and many of
them of a much higher Rank in Life than he mu&s;t ever pretend to;
who can only derive a <HI>Mock Title,</HI> not from his Ance&s;tors, but his
Shoulders. In his fir&s;t Edition he had traduc'd certain Characters, for
which every one has always had the utmo&s;t Veneration, and thinks
now, by leaving out the Names of &s;ome, and fal&s;ly filling up the
<PB N="12" REF="17">
Blanks of others, as well as by ab&s;conding for a Time, to e&s;cape the
Stripes that ought to be the ju&s;t Reward of &s;uch Writings. How mon|&s;trous
therefore has it been, to in&s;inuate, that they have reach'd a
Pre&s;ence, where <HI>Good Nature, Truth,</HI> and <HI>Humanity</HI> only can be gra|ciou&s;ly
receiv'd or encourag'd; the Rever&s;e whereof are the <HI>Characte|ri&s;ticks</HI>
of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>?</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that the Retailers in Scandal have always endeavour'd
to pa&s;s upon the World by the laudable Appellation of Satyri&s;ts, and
would take Shelter under the great Names of <HI>Horace, Juvenal,</HI> and
<HI>Boileau.</HI> Not con&s;idering, that the&s;e Precedents will never be to their
Purpo&s;e; tho&s;e generous Correctors of Vice, never attack'd Per&s;ons, but
Errors, nor ever expos'd the private Character, but the publick Ap|pearance
of Men, at the &s;ame Time taking e&s;pecial Care to pay the
&s;tricte&s;t Regard to Truth, even while the Scourge was in their
Hands; and therefore, <HI>Boileau,</HI> in his own Vindication, &s;peaking of
<HI>Chapelain,</HI> who was a bad Poet, &s;ays,
<Q><L>En blamant &s;es ecrits, ai je d'un Style Affreux</L>
<L>Di&s;tille &s;ur &s;a Vie un Venin Dangereux.</L></Q>
I mu&s;t likewi&s;e inform this half-learned Tribe, that the <HI>Codrus</HI> of <HI>Ju|venal,</HI>
which the&s;e abu&s;ive Writers &s;o often quote for their Ju&s;tification,
was no real Per&s;on, but a Name de&s;ign'd in general to &s;ignify any bad
Poet.</P>
<P>True and ju&s;t Satyr will always have its Weight; Scandal will al|ways
be condemn'd: The one is beneficial to Society, the other is detri|mental
to it. When&s;oever a Man has taken upon him&s;elf the Profe&s;|&s;ion
of any Art or Science, by Writing, or otherwi&s;e, he has certainly
&s;ubmitted his Talents therein to the Judgment of the World. A Wri|ter
therefore, who in that Art or Science, con&s;i&s;tent with good Man|ners,
expo&s;es the Defects of his Fellow Writer, be it by Ridicule or
Argument, is guilty of nothing that is blameable, but rather does a
Prai&s;e-worthy Action, by endeavouring to rectify the Judgments of
Men, and prevent Pretenders to Science from impo&s;ing on the Publick.
The cen&s;uring an Author then, only as &s;uch, is what every Man has a
Right to do, from the Moment he appears in Print, <HI>Hanc Veniam peti|mu&s;&abque;
Damu&s;&abque; vici&s;&s;im.</HI> But under this Pretext to attack his private Re|putation,
as a Member of Society, mu&s;t be the Re&s;ult of the &s;ame vil|lainous
Principles, as would lead a Man to be guilty of Robbery or
Murder, had he Courage enough for the Road. The Civil Magi&s;trate
<PB N="13" REF="18">
alone has a Right to enquire into Mens Per&s;onal Characters, and if they
de&s;erve it, to expo&s;e and puni&s;h them: And it &s;eems but ju&s;t, that
this Authority &s;hould be ve&s;ted &s;olely in him, &s;ince no one el&s;e can,
with any Certainty, be inform'd of what pa&s;&s;es in private Life.</P>
<P>The Predece&s;&s;ors of the Writer of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> the elaborate Au|thors
of <HI>Grub&s;treet,</HI> have frequently tran&s;gre&s;s'd this equitable Rule,
and finding too general a Propen&s;ity towards enquiring into the Ble|mi&s;hes
of (otherwi&s;e) Great Characters, have &s;ometimes been pretty
liberal of their Per&s;onal Reflections, in order to render their &s;everal
<HI>Dunciads</HI> the more Saleable: Yet the&s;e Men had at lea&s;t &s;o much Decency,
as to do this under feign'd Names, or by pointing at Per&s;ons only by
their initial Letters, which were lyable to various Readings. Thus,
whil&s;t the Ob&s;curity of their Scandal &s;creen'd them from Puni&s;hment,
their very Proceeding was a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion of the Guilt of &s;uch
Invectives. But it was doubtle&s;s re&s;erv'd for the <HI>Mode&s;t</HI> Author of the
<HI>Dunciad</HI> to invent the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of Scandal, by calling Men, every
Way his Superiors, <HI>Rogues, Blockheads, Drunkards,</HI> and <HI>Liars,</HI> in Print,
with their Names at length, whil&s;t he &s;uppre&s;&s;es his own, that he
may be exempt from the Fear of a very low Puni&s;hment, but to
which his Ears &s;eem to be legally intitled.</P>
<P>As this is my fir&s;t Appearance in Print, I have hitherto e&s;cap'd the
Malice of this Scandalmonger's Pen, and do not now write out of any
Hatred to him, but real Love for Mankind. A Regard to Humanity,
and the Rules of Society, have rais'd in me an Indignation again&s;t a Wri|ter,
who has the In&s;olence to appear in Publick, in Defiance of them
all. I am re&s;olv'd, therefore (tho' &s;uch a Procedure, with Relation to
any hone&s;t Man would be dete&s;table) to mark him to the World; let us
examine a little into the Character of this diminutive Creature, who
makes &s;o free with tho&s;e of other Men.</P>
<P>I find, that upon his fir&s;t coming to Town, out of pure Compa&s;&s;ion
for his exotick Figure, narrow Circum&s;tances, and humble Appearance,
the late Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> admitted him into his Society, and &s;uffer'd him,
notwith&s;tanding his Make, to be his humble admirer at <HI>Will</HI>'s; and af|terwards
finding in him a glimmering of Genius, recommended him
to &s;ome People of Rank, and introduc'd him to the mo&s;t eminent Men
of Letters; which Courte&s;y he &s;oon after repaid with a &s;atyrical Copy
of Ver&s;es on his Benefactor: This put an End to their Corre&s;pondence
&s;ome Time before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> dy'd. His Acquaintance by this
Means being made with Sir <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> they
likewi&s;e, in Compa&s;&s;ion to his unhappy Form, and de&s;titute Condition,
<PB N="14" REF="19">
endeavoured to procure him a Support under both, by &s;etting on Foot
a Sub&s;cription in his Behalf; it was, indeed, for a Work, which (as
has &s;ince appeared) they mu&s;t have known he was not equal to; but
they hoped, with their friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to have &s;upply'd his Defects.
However, his Sub&s;criptions were no &s;ooner full, when the little mi&s;|chievous
Urchin, no longer able to contain his Malice, wrote a Satyr
upon both the&s;e Gentlemen, (as he did afterwards an abu&s;ive Libel on
one of them;) and as many Things which had pa&s;s'd in private Con|ver&s;ation
at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, came to be known by the Lord <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI>
of which Infidelity <HI>Scriblerus</HI> was &s;u&s;pected, he was obliged to ab&s;ent
him&s;elf for &s;ome Years from thence. After this, he li&s;ted openly in the
<HI>Tory</HI> Service, and every Week publi&s;h'd &s;candalous Invectives on tho&s;e
very <HI>Whigs,</HI> who had been his ample&s;t <HI>Sub&s;cribers.</HI> He was in this ho|nourable
Occupation, when the late Queen dy'd; and our Poet &s;oon
changing his Note, found Means to be introduced to &s;ome of the young
Ladies of the Court. Four of the&s;e, who were his be&s;t Friends and
Patrone&s;&s;es, (as they are to any Thing that carries the Face of Wit or
Learning) he abu&s;ed in a Scurvy Ballad, for which any other Man
would have received Correction; but in his Ca&s;e, the&s;e generous Ladies
contented them&s;elves with &s;hewing a Contempt of his Malice, and
bani&s;hing him their Company. This did not hinder him from wri|ting
a &s;econd Lampoon, wherein he &s;pared not the mo&s;t exalted Cha|racters,
though under feigned Names; and adding Treachery to Ill-Nature,
he threw the &s;candalous Imputation of having wrote this
Libel, on a Lady of Quality, who&s;e Wit is equal to her Beauty, and
who&s;e Character might have &s;uffer'd by this impudent Forgery of his.
But I begin to be tired, as I believe your Lord&s;hip is too, with raking
into the dirty Parts of this foul Character. I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s over
the many other low Scenes of his Life, to come to his Ma&s;ter-piece
of Scandal, the <HI>DUNCIAD.</HI> This mi&s;hapen Lump of Malice and
Ill-nature, at the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of all his Friends, who feared his
Abu&s;e more than his Enemies, had for &s;ome Years forborn writing
Lampoons, except it were on a <HI>Curl</HI> or a <HI>Lintot</HI>; when at la&s;t, grown
weary of this Re&s;traint, and unable to live in Peace with Society, he
collected a Li&s;t of Names, yet unabu&s;ed by him, and re&s;olved to throw
them together into one Satyr. To furni&s;h him&s;elf, therefore, with
Matter, he went round all his Cully Book&s;ellers, enquiring for Scandal of
any Kind; and an abu&s;ive Story being told him, of a Par&s;on in Drink,
which the Relater thought could not come within his Scheme of Satyr,
as reflecting upon one that had never appear'd in Print; he told him
<PB N="15" REF="20">
that he was re&s;olved to put it down to <HI>Laurus</HI>; for as to the <HI>Truth</HI>
of it, the Town would never be at the Trouble to enquire into
that.</P>
<P>Thus compiled, and thus compo&s;ed, the <HI>DUNCIAD</HI> made its
Appearance la&s;t Summer, and was &s;o univer&s;ally exploded for its wit|le&s;s
Ill-nature and Fal&s;hood, that the Gentlemen traduced in it, being
only pointed at by their Initial Letters, did not think it worth their
Care to correct the Author, in the Manner he de&s;erv'd. Yet I have
been credibly inform'd, that &s;ome of them re&s;orted to no Place where
<HI>Scriblerus</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly be met with, without the Provi&s;ion of a Rod,
to whip this <HI>Old Boy,</HI> for his untoward Malice. But he ab&s;conding for
above a Month, and the Scandal having hurt no Creature, but the Au|thor
him&s;elf, their Re&s;entment cool'd; and the little Lampooner might
have been at Peace, had he not wantonly reviv'd the Memory of his
former Malice, by reprinting this pitiful Poem on Royal Paper, giving
at full Length the Names of mo&s;t of tho&s;e mention'd in It; together
with a Comment more abu&s;ive than the Text; which he publi&s;hed
under an Appellation very proper to him&s;elf, I mean that of <HI>Scrib|lerus.</HI>
This was &s;uch a con&s;ummate Piece of In&s;olence, as one would
think could admit of no Aggravation; yet he found Means to add one
Degree of Impudence more to it, by pre&s;uming at fir&s;t to make Men
of Rank and Quality, in a Manner, his <HI>Publi&s;hers.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip may wonder, that one, who has conducted him&s;elf
after this Manner, &s;hould not have &s;uffer'd under the due Correction of
&s;ome of tho&s;e, whom he has thus wantonly abu&s;ed. It is mo&s;t certain,
that nothing in the Figure of a Man, could have e&s;caped Puni&s;hment,
for &s;uch repeated In&s;ults, many of them on Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction. But
this Poeta&s;ter having unhappily a Re&s;emblance in his Size and Make, to
the Animal much inferior to Man; it &s;eems he has been univer&s;ally
look'd upon, as beneath the Dignity of Re&s;entment. Upon this Occa|&s;ion,
I cannot but call to Mind a Story (which I have &s;omewhere read)
of an hone&s;t Highlander, who was walking along <HI>Holborn,</HI> when he
heard a Voice cry, <HI>Rogue Scot, Rogue Scot,</HI> his Northern Blood fired at
the In&s;ult, and he drew his broad Sword, looking round him on every
Side, to di&s;cover the Object of his Indignation, when at la&s;t he found
that the Voice came from a Parrot, perch'd on a Balcony within his Reach;
But the <HI>Generous Scot,</HI> di&s;daining to &s;tain his Tru&s;ty Blade with &s;uch
ignoble Blood, put up his Sword again, with a &s;our Smile, &s;aying, <HI>Gin
ye were a Mon, as ye're a Green Geu&s;e, I would &s;plit your Weem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21">
A Sword, indeed, has never been deem'd a Weapon fit for the Cor|rection
of Libellers. <HI>Ther&s;ites,</HI> who, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer,</HI> re&s;embles
our Author, both in Shape and Malice, was cudgell'd by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> for
his faucy Language to his Betters. <HI>Aretin,</HI> the only Author, be&s;ides
that of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> within the&s;e Three Hundred Years, that acquired
a famous Infamy by his Pen, bragg'd of keeping many Kings and Prin|ces
tributary to him, in order to purcha&s;e an Exemption from his Sa|tyrs.
Yet it &s;eems, &s;ome of the Princes of his own Country found out
a better Method of dealing with him; for having been abu&s;ed by him,
they order'd the in&s;olent Creature &s;uch a Ba&s;tinado, as at once put an
End to his Satyrical Vein. And being by this Treatment brought to
him&s;elf, he had &s;uch a true Sen&s;e of his vile Character, that he turned
his Mind wholly toward Devotion: In which Strain he wrote many
Books with &s;uch Succe&s;s, as to obtain at length, the Name of the <HI>Di|vine
Aretin.</HI> Should the like Treatment of the Father of the <HI>Dunciad</HI>
produce the like Effect, what Service might he not be of to Religion,
by compo&s;ing Pious Hymns, for the great Fe&s;tivals of the Year, and
perhaps by a Tran&s;lation of all the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> the fir&s;t of which, it &s;eems,
he has already imitated in a mo&s;t edifying Manner? Were <HI>Scriblerus</HI> to
undertake the whole <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> and perform that Work with the Ju&s;tne&s;s
and Accuracy of his other Tran&s;lations, it might not only eclip&s;e <HI>Stern|hold</HI>
and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> but even vie with that of <HI>Tate</HI> and <HI>Brady</HI>: And
then, what would not the Publick owe to tho&s;e, who, by the <HI>Human</HI>
Means of a Stick, &s;hould have wrought &s;o u&s;eful, as well as <HI>praeter natu|ral</HI>
a <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Aretin</HI> had the Shape of a Man, and might bear a <HI>Beating</HI>;
whereas, our Poet mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity expire under the very fir&s;t Blow;
and he can, by the Structure of his Per&s;on, only be liable to one Sort
of Correction, that of the <HI>Rod</HI>; which &s;ome Years ago Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e
Philips,</HI> being abu&s;ed by him, bought for his U&s;e, and &s;tuck up at
the Bar of <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e; and which he avoided by his u&s;ual
Practice after every Lampoon, of remaining a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner at Home.
The &s;ame Di&s;cipline was prepar'd for him la&s;t Summer, which he
e&s;cap'd in the Manner abovementioned; and I am inform'd, that the
Rods are now ready for his Cha&s;ti&s;ement, as &s;oon as he &s;hall be
found in a proper Place for whipping.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, as all Criminals who fly from Ju&s;tice are exe|cuted
in <HI>Effigie,</HI> his Figure is expo&s;ed, and four In&s;criptions under it,
on the &s;everal Sides of the Pede&s;tal, in <HI>Greek, Latin, Spani&s;h,</HI> and
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> In the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> for having offended tho&s;e Languages,
<PB N="17" REF="22">
by pre&s;uming to tran&s;late or imitate what he did not under&s;tand:
And in his native Tongue, for having made his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mu&s;e, which
ought to be cha&s;te and delicate, to &s;peak the Language of the Stews,
and of <HI>Billing&s;gate.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h In&s;cription</HI> carries in it an In&s;truc|tion
which might have been of u&s;e to him had he read it, before he
became a <HI>Libeller</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>Satyri&s;t.</HI> This curious Image having
been communicated to me, by one of tho&s;e who are abu&s;ed in the
<HI>Dunciad,</HI> in who&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it now is, I thought it proper to take
a Cut from it, which I have prefix'd to this Publication.</P>
<P>When&s;oever it happens, that a worthy Mind is lodg'd in a deform'd
Body, I am per&s;waded that all vertuous Men commi&s;erate the Ca&s;e,
and far from indulging any Reflections on the Figure, would u&s;e
their utmo&s;t Endeavours to make both the Owner and the re&s;t of the
World forget it: But when, as is the &s;ad Fate of the Author of
the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> a crooked Carca&s;s is become the Habitation of a much
more crooked Mind; and when this Creature, far from being hum|bled
by the irregularity of the Form a&s;&s;ign'd him by Providence,
makes the very De&s;picablene&s;s of it a Protection to him, for venting
&s;uch Malice, as he would not dare to utter, were he a po&s;&s;ible Mark for
Indignation to lay hold of. I think, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, Mind and Body,
which &s;eem &s;o well adapted to each other, &s;hould go together, and
be jointly exhibited and expos'd to the Contempt of that Society,
which can have no other Reparations made them, for the Injuries of
&s;uch an untoward Animal.</P>
<P>A vertuous Man has &s;trongly implanted in him a Philanthropy or
innate Humanity, which re&s;trains him from reflecting too &s;everely
on the Frailties of his Fellow Creatures, as remembring, that they are
all of them of one Species. But <HI>Scriblerus</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed indeed, in a
mo&s;t remarkable Manner, by Nature, from the re&s;t of Mankind; has no
Tenderne&s;s or Regard for them, but looks upon him&s;elf as one of a quite
different Race of Beings; nor &s;hall I ever look upon him in another
Light.</P>
<P>Where, indeed, is the Definition of <HI>Man,</HI> to which he can be &s;aid
to an&s;wer? If <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> be the Term, can he have the A&s;&s;urance to pre|tend
to that Characteri&s;tick, who looks with Envy on every Thing
that contributes to the Peace or Benefit of Society, and is never happy,
but when he is creating Feuds and Animo&s;ities even among&s;t the
mo&s;t intimate of his Acquintance? If Man be &s;tiled a <HI>Rational</HI> Crea|ture,
will <HI>Scriblerus</HI> come within that De&s;cription, who knowing how
little able he is to defend either his own Character or Per&s;on, wan|tonly
<PB N="18" REF="23">
begins the Attack on others? <HI>Man</HI> is often defined to be a <HI>Ri|&s;ible
Animal</HI>; were this meant to denote a <HI>Creature that we laugh</HI> at, the
Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> would bid fair to be comprehended; but all
the Grammarians agree, that it &s;ignifies an <HI>Animal &s;u&s;ceptible of Laugh|ter,</HI>
which, <HI>Scriblerus</HI> was never in good Humour enough, with him|&s;elf,
or others, to be, nor has he been ob&s;erv'd, &s;ince the Hour of his
Birth, to have ri&s;en above a broad Grin, common to him with the
Quadrupede, mo&s;t re&s;embling Human Nature. Thus, what&s;oever is the
Definition, He &s;till appears excluded from the Human Species, which
may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure account for, as well as excu&s;e his univer&s;al
ill Will to our Race.</P>
<P>As I find that this la&s;t pompous Edition of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> is in <HI>Quarto,</HI>
I have conform'd my&s;elf to that Size in this Publication, that your
Lord&s;hip may be enabled to bind up this true Account of the <HI>Au|thor</HI>
and his <HI>Effigies</HI> with the Work it &s;elf, &s;ince all of them &s;eem
calculated for one and the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, to make his <HI>Infamy immor|tal,
and his Malice contemptible.</HI></P>
<P>I have the Plea&s;ure to give your Lord&s;hip in Publick, this Te&s;timo|ny
of my Obedience, and of the Re&s;pect with which</P>

&s;urmounted this Difficulty, and call'd

honour'd with the Re&s;idence of a

his Poetical Underlings and Commen|tators.
It is mo&s;t plea&s;antly &s;ituated,
on the Banks of the Great River
<HI>Thames,</HI> and hath been celebrated in
<HI>Lyric</HI> Poetry, by the late Mr. <HI>Thomas
D'Urfey,</HI> who, in his <HI>Richmond Balls,</HI>

<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Adage, <HI>Little and Loud.</HI></P>
<Q><HI>And</HI> Martin Scribler <HI>was his Name.</HI></Q>
<P>He was not like the Generality of
Clerks, content with reading or &s;ing|ing
the Works of other Men, but
likewi&s;e compo&s;ed many of his own.
And perhaps too audaciou&s;ly as well
as too ludicrou&s;ly invaded the Sacred
Province of <HI>King David,</HI> by vying with
him in P&s;almody. Tho' I am told,
that our <HI>Martin</HI> went no farther than
the Fir&s;t P&s;alm, not having met with
any Sort of Encouragement in that
Undertaking.</P>

bears a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Re&s;emblance to a Steeple,
ina&s;much as both are intended for the
Omament of the Church. What
<HI>Church Scribler's Steeple-Crown</HI> now a|dorneth,
is as much a Que&s;tion, as it
was anciently what City might claim
the Birth of <HI>Homer.</HI> However, it
&s;hould &s;eem by the <HI>Crown</HI> being its
&s;elf a <HI>Steeple,</HI> that <HI>Martin</HI>'s <HI>Typical
Head</HI> belonged to &s;ome <HI>Church</HI> that
claimed to <HI>it&s;elf</HI> the Supremacy.</P>
<P><HI>Cricket</HI>'s <HI>Voice.</HI> This is an Animal
famous for the Smallne&s;s of his Voice
and Legs. He is ob&s;erved to creep
into the Chimneys of old Hou&s;es,
where there is much Filth and Na&s;ti|ne&s;s,
and where the Walls are full of
Holes. Hence, Men, who get into
Families only to pick up Scandal, and
find out their Flaws, are often a&s;&s;imi|lated
to <HI>Crickets.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monkey's Brain.</HI> This is not to be

And as Monkeys are
commonly mi&s;chievous Mimicks, we

<P>And this <HI>Reading</HI> they &s;upport from

where Expre&s;&s;ions tantamount
are very frequent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alexandrine</HI> Copy, to which we
&s;hall pay all due Veneration, runs
thus:<Q><L><HI>Did any drop their Evening Cates,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whip, a Lampoon was at their Gates.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This Lection is not likewi&s;e un|&s;upported

<P><HI>The Vicar.</HI> A very inoffen&s;ive Di|vine,
who had never given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Clerk
any Provocation; but he could not
bear any one of a Rank &s;uperior to
his in the Church, and was offended
at the Vicar's pretending to &s;ing in
another Key than He had &s;et the

<P>As to the Term <HI>Beuk-learn'd,</HI> I
find our Scholia&s;t ob&s;erves, that this

<HEAD>A Curious Receipt, wherein is di&s;clo&s;ed,
the Art of writing Poetry with a &s;mall
Genius, taken from <HI>MARTINUS
SCRIBLERUS's</HI> Writings.</HEAD>
<P>READER, be thou Gentle, or be thou otherwi&s;e, I have al|way
thy Profit and Plea&s;ure before mine Eyes, from the
which I &s;hall not readily &s;werve, el&s;e maye&s;t Thou, in all
Probability, ca&s;t me off, as is u&s;ually practic'd with unprofitable
Servants. As I have by my Sagacity di&s;cover'd certain mechanical
Rules, by the Help whereof <HI>Scriblerus</HI> hath obtained unto him&s;elf
the Name of a mighty Poet: I que&s;tion not, but the imparting
the &s;ame unto Thee, will be of Contentment and Delight. It may
furthermore be a Work conducive toward the Strength and Glory of
this my native I&s;land, by multiplying the Number of Poets therein.
The&s;e have hitherto been but few, from a mi&s;taken Opinion, that a Ge|nius,
Learning, and a good Ear, were requi&s;ite to con&s;titute a Poet;
whereas, from the following plain and ea&s;y Rules, it will mo&s;t evi|dently
appear, that Application and Practice only are nece&s;&s;ary. By the
Help of the&s;e, I will undertake, that any indu&s;trious <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> may,
in the Space of one Month, become as great a Ver&s;ificator, as even the
Great <HI>Scriblerus</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let the Man then, who&s;e &s;ublime Pa&s;&s;ion it is to &s;hine in Poe&s;y,
accu&s;tom him&s;elf to <HI>Tautophonys,</HI> or Ingeminations of Sounds. This is
<PB N="2" REF="31">
mo&s;t effectually perform'd, by &s;electing Words, that begin with the &s;ame
Con&s;onant, and the&s;e placed at due Di&s;tances, Two, Three, or more,
in one and the &s;ame Ver&s;e, create a Mu&s;ick in Poetry, in&s;omuch,
as that the Lines &s;o compo&s;ed, may be indifferently, either <HI>&s;ung</HI> or
<HI>&s;aid.</HI> Of a Truth, this is an Art, which &s;eemeth to have e&s;caped
the Knowledge of all the Antients, whether of <HI>Greece</HI> or of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and was hidden from the mo&s;t celebrated even of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poets,
being, like many other ine&s;timable Secrets, wrapt in the dark <HI>Womb</HI> of
Time, to be brought to Light only by the &s;kilfull <HI>Midwifery</HI> of the
Renowned <HI>Scriblerus.</HI> Some Traces, indeed, there are of this Art,
among&s;t &s;ome of the Monki&s;h Writers, from whence our Poet may
have taken the Hint. But the Monks never reduc'd the &s;ame to any
regular Practice (as our modern Cla&s;&s;ick hath done) nor did they
make u&s;e thereof in any but <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es, and tho&s;e chiefly <HI>Technical</HI>
ones, for the Help of Memory: So that the Invention, or at lea&s;t
the Perfection of this <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> is owing to <HI>Martinus.</HI></P>
<P>Conformable to his Rules, were I to mention an Author, who&s;e Pride
could bear no Fame but his own, and that of his &s;ervile Flatterers,
I would make the Ver&s;es run thus,
<Q><L>Poets &s;upport, like Pamper'd Prie&s;ts, their Pride;</L>
<L>Such Stigmatize as Stick not to their Side.</L></Q>
Where the well cho&s;en <HI>P</HI>'s of the fir&s;t Line, and the &s;oft hi&s;&s;ing
<HI>S</HI>'s of the Second, compo&s;e a mo&s;t excellent Harmony. But pa&s;t all
Peradventure, Courteous Reader, for &s;uch doubtle&s;s by this Time
thou art become, thou maye&s;t deem it more for thy In&s;truction to
learn this Poetical Jingle in the Words of <HI>Scriblerus</HI> him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I might give a thou&s;and more In&s;tances of the &s;ame Nature, for in|deed
there are not any two Lines together, in the whole <HI>Dunciad,</HI>
or in any other of the <HI>Writings</HI> of this Author, wherein the &s;ame
<HI>mechanical Trick</HI> is not practi&s;ed: And it is from thence that
He hath acquir'd the Name of <HI>Melodious Martin,</HI> and not, as hath
been fal&s;ely in&s;inuated from his having &s;ung his own P&s;alm in a
certain Lutheran Congregation, the which we e&s;teem of, only as a
fictitious Tale devis'd for Mirth, it being well known, that our Poet
belongeth to a much more ancient <HI>Church.</HI> But to return to our
Subject. Who&s;oever, by an unwearied Exerci&s;e in Vocabularies
and Dictionaries of Rhyme, &s;hall have repleni&s;h'd the Tubes of his
Memory with Similar Sounds, will, in Proportion to his Application
and Labour therein, rival, or even &s;urpa&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, the Merit of
our Great <HI>Martinus.</HI></P>
<P>Any Per&s;on, moderately vers'd in Poetical Works, mu&s;t have re|mark'd,
that Adjectives are mo&s;t commonly foi&s;ted in, not to add to
the Sen&s;e, but in order to fill up the Mea&s;ure of a Ver&s;e. In all
&s;uch Emergencies, it behoveth our Apprentice in Poe&s;y, to make a mo&s;t
fervent Search for an Adjective, that beginneth with the &s;ame Let|ter
as his Sub&s;tantive, even although the Context &s;hould &s;eem to &s;uf|fer
thereby. Thus mu&s;t <HI>Comfort</HI> always be cold, the <HI>Day</HI> at Noon
<HI>Dawning,</HI> the <HI>Fury</HI> even of <HI>Scriblerus Fatal, Garments Gorgeous</HI> though
all tatter'd, <HI>Head Heavy, Limbs Lazy, Mind Muddy, Night Noi&s;y,</HI>
<HI>Plight Plea&s;ing</HI> be it never &s;o &s;ad, <HI>Quail Quivering, Rake Reeling</HI> tho'
&s;ober, <HI>Sot Social,</HI> and <HI>Treat</HI> or <HI>Theobald Ta&s;tele&s;s.</HI> True it is, that
<PB N="4" REF="33">
this ingenious Gentleman hath manife&s;ted as good a Ta&s;te as any of
our Writers what&s;oever; but what hath Truth to do with <HI>Scriblerick</HI>
Poetry? His Name, and <HI>Ta&s;tele&s;s,</HI> both commence with the &s;ame Letter;
and therefore, untill He &s;hall pre&s;ent us with a more convenient Ad|jective,
beginning with a T, He mu&s;t be contented with this abu&s;ive
and unju&s;t one, <HI>Euphoniae Gratia.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Adjectives, or others in their Stead, having been choicely
collected, as has been premis'd, out of the Dictionary, con&s;tant Re|gard
being had to the initial Con&s;onant, they mu&s;t at &s;ometimes immedi|ately
precede or follow their Re&s;pective Sub&s;tantives, and at others
may be &s;ever'd at a due Di&s;tance from the &s;ame, from whence
will re&s;ult a mo&s;t delectable Variety of Harmony. For the fir&s;t Sort,
take this <HI>Example,</HI>
<Q><L>Form'd was his Figure Foul, in Limbs, in Face,</L>
<L>A Perfect Parody on human race.</L></Q>
But, Reader, Thou wilt be much more edify'd with the Words of
<HI>Martinus,</HI> the Father and undi&s;puted Inventor of this Poe&s;y. Hear
then, the Soft Sweet-warbling <HI>Twick'nam</HI> Swan.</P>

Although we have as yet only mention'd <HI>Adjectives,</HI> yet may the
ob&s;erving Reader have &s;een, from the In&s;tances given, that <HI>Verbs</HI>

<L>And as thy Make, &s;o Mon&s;trous is thy Mind.</L></Q>
<P>But without all Doubt, the Reader coveteth Examples from the Mouth
of <HI>Martinus,</HI> as being far more authentic, than any faint Re&s;emblances
of his Art. I &s;hall therefore &s;ubjoin a few.</P>

<P>Thus have I, worthy Reader, explained unto Thee the fir&s;t Secret
in <HI>Scriblerus</HI>'s Poe&s;y, namely, That Divine one of Ingemination; and
as I have &s;et before Thee a great Diver&s;ity of Examples, The&s;e
mu&s;t &s;uffice to give Thee full Light into this My&s;tery; the Re&s;t
mu&s;t be the Re&s;ult of thine own Diligence in putting this Precept
Properly in Practice.</P>
<P>Proceed we then to certain other mechanical Rules, whereby great
and eminent Poets may be produc'd, without the Help of Genius. In
the &s;econd Place therefore the
<Q>&mdash; Hiatus in M. S. valde Deflendus</Q></P>
<P>Although in this Place there be a Gap in our Manu&s;cript, which can
never enough be lamented by the Learned, yet are there pre&s;erv'd
to us many Fragments of the &s;ame, containing mo&s;t curious Secrets;
<PB N="6" REF="35">
but as they are replete with Quotations from <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> I mu&s;t defer
exhibiting them 'till a more convenient Sea&s;on. I think in the long
Winter Nights, in which all well regulated Families a&s;&s;emble round
the Chimney, a Pre&s;ent of this Nature may not be uncomfortable.
At &s;uch a Sea&s;on, &s;hould any one, endued with an even &s;teady Voice,
read the many Excerptions out of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> contain'd in the re|maining
Parts of this Manu&s;cript, what with the genial Warmth of
the Fire, the Lullaby whi&s;tling of the Wind, and the <HI>Monotony,</HI> or
Samene&s;s of Sound in the Ver&s;es, That Slumber might effectually
be procur'd, which is &s;o &s;oporiferou&s;ly de&s;crib'd in the &s;econd Book
of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> Perhaps that good Effect might be produc'd at this
very Hour, without any concurring Helps, were it po&s;&s;ible to find
People, who&s;e Blood in Spring ran &s;luggi&s;h enough to &s;it &s;till and
hear &s;uch a <HI>Work</HI> read to them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great Veneration I have for the Author of the
preceding Manu&s;cript, yet mu&s;t I beg leave to animadvert on one
A&s;&s;ertion therein, which I take to be erroneous; <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Divine
Art of Ingemination of Sounds</HI> in Poe&s;y, was the &s;ole Invention of
<HI>Martinus Scriblerus</HI>; whereas, in Ju&s;tice to the Memory of his Pre|dece&s;&s;or
Mr. <HI>John Grub,</HI> the Great Founder of the Street and Sect,
which &s;till bear his Name, I &s;hall venture to affirm, that he was no
Stranger to this My&s;tery. This will mo&s;t evidently appear by a mo&s;t
curious Fragment of his, which I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin; and which,
perhaps, may be a Pre&s;ent as welcome to the Publick, as tho&s;e many
Books of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> &s;aid to have been lately retriev'd by the Fidelity
of the <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan</HI> Library Keeper, who may well be &s;tyl'd the
<HI>Bentley</HI> of the Ea&s;t. Such is the Beauty of the Allegory, couch'd
in the few Lines of our Fragment, and &s;uch the Harmony of its
Ver&s;ification, as may ju&s;tly entitle it to a Place in the next <HI>Edition</HI>
of the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> The Ver&s;es of Mr. <HI>Grub</HI> are as follow.</P>

&s;uch doubtle&s;s he is, who has been &s;o good as to accompany me
