<HEAD>THE LIFE and OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY, Gent.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I Have begun a new book, on purpo&s;e that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was involved, from the many di&s;cour&s;es and interroga|tions about the &s;iege of <HI>Namur,</HI> where he received his wound.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remind the reader, in ca&s;e he has read the hi&s;tory of King <HI>William</HI>'s
<PB N="2" REF="3">
wars,&mdash;but if he has not,&mdash;I then inform him, that one of the mo&s;t memorable at|tacks in that &s;iege, was that which was made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> upon the point of the advanced counter&s;carp, be|fore the gate of <HI>St. Nicolas,</HI> which inclo|&s;ed the great &s;luice or water-&s;top, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were terribly expo&s;ed to the &s;hot of the counter-guard and demi|ba&s;tion of <HI>St. Roch:</HI> The i&s;&s;ue of which hot di&s;pute, in three words, was this; That the <HI>Dutch</HI> lodged them&s;elves upon the counter-guard,&mdash;and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the covered way before <HI>St. Nicolas</HI>'s gate, notwith|&s;tanding the gallantry of the <HI>French</HI> offi|cers, who expo&s;ed them&s;elves upon the glacis &s;word in hand.</P>
<P>As this was the principal attack of which my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was an eye-witne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="4">
at <HI>Namur,</HI>&mdash;the army of the be&s;iegers being cut off, by the confluence of the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Sambre,</HI> from &s;eeing much of each other's operations,&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was generally more eloquent and parti|cular in his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, aro&s;e out of the almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties he found in telling his &s;tory intelligibly, and giving &s;uch clear ideas of the differ|ences and di&s;tinctions between the &s;carp and counter&s;carp,&mdash;the glacis and co|vered way,&mdash;the half-moon and rave|lin,&mdash;as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.</P>
<P>Writers them&s;elves are too apt to con|found the&s;e terms;&mdash;&s;o that you will the le&s;s wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in oppo&s;ition to ma|ny
<PB N="4" REF="5">
mi&s;conceptions, that my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> did oft times puzzle his vi&s;iters, and &s;ometimes him&s;elf too.</P>
<P>To &s;peak the truth, unle&s;s the compa|ny my father led up &s;tairs were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was in one of his be&s;t explanatory moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the di&s;cour&s;e free from ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> was this,&mdash;that in the attack of the counter&s;carp before the gate of <HI>St. Ni|colas,</HI> extending it&s;elf from the bank of the <HI>Maes,</HI> quite up to the great water|&s;top;&mdash;the ground was cut and cro&s;s-cut with &s;uch a multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and &s;luices, on all &s;ides,&mdash;and he would get &s;o &s;adly bewilder'd and &s;et
<PB N="5" REF="6">
fa&s;t among&s;t them, that frequently he could neither get backwards or for|wards to &s;ave his life; and was oft times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only.</P>
<P>The&s;e perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle <HI>Toby Shandy</HI> more perturbations than you would imagine; and as my father's kindne&s;s to him was continually dragging up fre&s;h friends and fre&s;h in|quirers,&mdash;he had but a very unea&s;y ta&s;k of it.</P>
<P>No doubt my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had great command of him&s;elf,&mdash;and could guard appearances, I believe, as well as mo&s;t men;&mdash;yet any one may imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the ra|velin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered way without
<PB N="6" REF="7">
falling down the counter&s;carp, nor cro&s;s the dyke without danger of &s;lipping into the ditch, but that he mu&s;t have fretted and fumed inwardly:&mdash;He did &s;o;&mdash;and the&s;e little and hourly vexations, which may &s;eem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> yet, whoever has read <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> or Dr. <HI>James Mackenzie,</HI> and has con&s;idered well the effects which the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the mind have upon the di|ge&s;tion,&mdash;(Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?)&mdash;may ea&s;ily conceive what &s;harp paroxi&s;ms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> mu&s;t have undergone upon that &s;core only.</P>
<P>&mdash;My uncle <HI>Toby</HI> could not philo&s;o|phize upon it;&mdash;'twas enough he felt it was &s;o,&mdash;and having &s;u&s;tained the pain and &s;orrows of it for three months toge|ther,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
he was re&s;olved &s;ome way or other to extricate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the angui&s;h and nature of the wound upon his groin &s;uffering him to lye in no other po&s;ition, when a thought came into his head, that if he could purcha&s;e &s;uch a thing, and have it pa&s;ted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortifications of the town and citadel of <HI>Namur,</HI> with its environs, it might be a means of giving him ea&s;e.&mdash;I take notice of his de&s;ire to have the environs along with the town and cita|del, for this rea&s;on,&mdash;becau&s;e my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s wound was got in one of the tra|ver&s;es, about thirty toi&s;es from the re|turning angle of the trench, oppo&s;ite to the &s;alient angle of the demi-ba&s;tion of <HI>St. Roch</HI>;&mdash;&s;o that he was pretty con|fident
<PB N="8" REF="9">
he could &s;tick a pin upon the iden|tical &s;pot of ground where he was &s;tand|ing in when the &s;tone &s;truck him.</P>
<P>All this &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes, and not only freed him from a world of &s;ad explanations, but, in the end, it prov'd the happy means, as you will read, of procuring my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> his HOBBY-HORSE.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing &s;o fooli&s;h, when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind, as to or|der things &s;o badly, as to let your cri|ticks and gentry of refined ta&s;te run it down: Nor is there any thing &s;o likely
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to make them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or, what is full as offen&s;ive, of be&s;towing your attention upon the re&s;t of your gue&s;ts in &s;o parti|cular a way, as if there was no &s;uch thing as a critick (by occupation) at table.</P>
<P>&mdash;I guard again&s;t both; for, in the fir&s;t place, I have left half a dozen places purpo&s;ely open for them;&mdash;and, in the next place, I pay them all court,&mdash;Gentlemen, I ki&s;s your hands,&mdash;I pro|te&s;t no company could give me half the plea&s;ure,&mdash;by my &s;oul I am glad to &s;ee you,&mdash;I beg only you will make no &s;trangers of your&s;elves, but &s;it down without any ceremony, and fall on hear|tily.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
I &s;aid I had left &s;ix places, and I was upon the point of carrying my complai|&s;ance &s;o far, as to have left a &s;eventh open for them,&mdash;and in this very &s;pot I &s;tand on;&mdash;but being told by a critick, (tho' not by occupation,&mdash;but by nature) that I had acquitted my&s;elf well enough, I &s;hall fill it up directly, hoping, in the mean time, that I &s;hall be able to make a great deal of more room next year.</P>
<P>&mdash;How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> who, it &s;eems, was a military man, and whom you have repre&s;ented as no fool,&mdash;be at the &s;ame time &s;uch a confu&s;ed, pudding-headed, muddle-headed fellow, as&mdash;Go look.</P>
<P>So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I &s;corn it.&mdash;'Tis language un|urbane,&mdash;and only befitting the man
<PB N="11" REF="12">
who cannot give clear and &s;atisfactory accounts of things, or dive deep enough into the fir&s;t cau&s;es of human ignorance and confu&s;ion. It is moreover the re|ply valiant,&mdash;and therefore I reject it; for tho' it might have &s;uited my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s character as a &s;oldier excellently well,&mdash;and had he not accu&s;tomed him|&s;elf, in &s;uch attacks, to whi&s;tle the <HI>Lilla|bullero,</HI>&mdash;as he wanted no courage, 'tis the very an&s;wer he would have given; yet it would by no means have done for me. You &s;ee as plain as can be, that I write as a man of erudition;&mdash;that even my &s;imilies, my allu&s;ions, my illu&s;tra|tions, my metaphors, are erudite,&mdash;and that I mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain my character properly, and contra&s;t it properly too,&mdash;el&s;e what would become of me? Why, Sir, I &s;hould be undone;&mdash;at this very mo|ment that I am going here to fill up one
<PB N="12" REF="13">
place again&s;t a critick,&mdash;I &s;hould have made an opening for a couple.</P>
<P>&mdash;Therefore I an&s;wer thus:</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you ever read &s;uch a book as <HI>Locke</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay upon the Human Under&s;tanding?&mdash;Don't an&s;wer me ra&s;hly,&mdash;becau&s;e many, I know, quote the book, who have not read it,&mdash;and many have read it who under&s;tand it not:&mdash;If either of the&s;e is your ca&s;e, as I write to in&s;truct, I will tell you in three words what the book is.&mdash;It is a hi&s;tory.&mdash;A hi&s;tory! of who? what? where? when? Don't hurry your&s;elf.&mdash;It is a hi&s;tory-book, Sir, (which may po&s;&s;ibly recom|mend it to the world) of what pa&s;&s;es in a man's own mind; and if you will &s;ay &s;o much of the book, and no more, believe
<PB N="13" REF="14">
me, you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphy&s;ic circle.</P>
<P>But this by the way.</P>
<P>Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into the bottom of this matter, it will be found that the cau&s;e of ob&s;curity and confu&s;ion, in the mind of man, is threefold.</P>
<P>Dull organs, dear Sir, in the fir&s;t place. Secondly, &s;light and tran&s;ient impre&s;&s;ions made by objects when the &s;aid organs are not dull. And, thirdly, a memory like unto a &s;ieve, not able to retain what it has received.&mdash;Call down <HI>Dolly</HI> your cham|ber-maid, and I will give you my cap and bell along with it, if I make not this matter &s;o plain that <HI>Dolly</HI> her&s;elf &s;hall under&s;tand it as well as <HI>Malbranch.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="15">
When <HI>Dolly</HI> has indited her epi&s;tle to <HI>Robin,</HI> and has thru&s;t her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right-&s;ide;&mdash;take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception, can, by nothing in this world, be &s;o aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which <HI>Dolly</HI>'s hand is in &s;earch of.&mdash;Your organs are not &s;o dull that I &s;hould inform you,&mdash;'tis an inch, Sir, of red &s;eal-wax.</P>
<P>When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if <HI>Dolly</HI> fumbles too long for her thimble, till the wax is over harden'd, it will not receive the mark of her thim|ble from the u&s;ual impul&s;e which was wont to imprint it. Very well: If <HI>Dolly</HI>'s wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper too &s;oft,&mdash;tho' it may re|ceive,&mdash;it will not hold the impre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
how hard &s;oever <HI>Dolly</HI> thru&s;ts again&s;t it; and la&s;t of all, &s;uppo&s;ing the wax good, and eke the thimble, but applied there|to in carele&s;s ha&s;te, as her Mi&s;tre&s;s rings the bell;&mdash;in any one of the&s;e three ca&s;es, the print, left by the thimble, will be as unlike the prototype as a bra&s;s|jack.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t under&s;tand that not one of the&s;e was the true cau&s;e of the confu&s;ion in my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e; and it is for that very rea&s;on I enlarge upon them &s;o long, after the manner of great phy&s;iologi&s;ts,&mdash;to &s;hew the world what it did <HI>not</HI> ari&s;e from.</P>
<P>What it did ari&s;e from, I have hinted above, and a fertile &s;ource of ob&s;curity it is,&mdash;and ever will be,&mdash;and that is the un&s;teady u&s;es of words which have per|plexed
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t exalted un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P>It is ten to one (at <HI>Arthur</HI>'s) whether you have ever read the literary hi&s;tories of pa&s;t ages;&mdash;if you have,&mdash;what ter|rible battles, 'yclept logomachies, have they occa&s;ioned and perpetuated with &s;o much gall and ink-&s;hed,&mdash;that a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>Gentle critick! when thou ha&s;t weigh'd all this, and con&s;ider'd within thy&s;elf how much of thy own knowledge, di&s;cour&s;e, and conver&s;ation has been pe&s;tered and di&s;ordered, at one time or other, by this, and this only:&mdash;What a pudder and racket in COUNCILS about <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">; and in the SCHOOLS of the learned about power and about &s;pirit;&mdash;about
<PB N="17" REF="18">
e&s;&s;ences, and about quinte&s;&s;ences;&mdash;about &s;ub&s;tances, and about &s;pace.&mdash;What confu&s;ion in greater THEATRES from words of little meaning, and as in|determinate a &s;en&s;e;&mdash;when thou con&s;i|ders this, thou wilt not wonder at my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s perplexities,&mdash;thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his &s;carp and his coun|ter&s;carp;&mdash;his glacis and his covered-way;&mdash;his ravelin and his half-moon: 'Twas not by ideas,&mdash;by heaven! his life was put in jeopardy by words.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> got his map of <HI>Namur</HI> to his mind, he began immediately to apply him&s;elf, and with the utmo&s;t diligence, to the &s;tudy of it; for nothing being of more importance
<PB N="18" REF="19">
to him than his recovery, and his reco|very depending, as you have read, up|on the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nice&s;t care to make him&s;elf &s;o far ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject, as to be able to talk upon it without emotion.</P>
<P>In a fortnight's clo&s;e and painful ap|plication, which, by the bye, did my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s wound, upon his groin, no good,&mdash;he was enabled, by the help of &s;ome marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together with <HI>Gobe&s;ius</HI>'s mi|litary architecture and pyroballogy, tran|&s;lated from the <HI>Flemi&s;h,</HI> to form his di&s;|cour&s;e with pa&s;&s;able per&s;picuity; and before he was two full months gone,&mdash;he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not only the attack of the advan|ced
<PB N="19" REF="20">
counter&s;carp with great order;&mdash;but having, by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than what his fir&s;t motive made nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was able to cro&s;s the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Sambre</HI>; make diver&s;ions as far as <HI>Vauban</HI>'s line, the abbey of <HI>Sal&s;ines, &amp;c.</HI> and give his vi&s;iters as di&s;tinct a hi&s;tory of each of their attacks, as of that of the gate of <HI>St. Nicolas,</HI> where he had the honour to receive his wound.</P>
<P>But the de&s;ire of knowledge, like the thir&s;t of riches, increa&s;es ever with the ac|qui&s;ition of it. The more my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> pored over his map, the more he took a liking to it;&mdash;by the &s;ame proce&s;s and electrical a&s;&s;imilation, as I told you, thro' which I ween the &s;ouls of connoi&s;&s;eurs them&s;elves, by long friction and incum|bition, have the happine&s;s, at length, to
<PB N="20" REF="21">
get all be-virtu'd,&mdash;be-pictur'd,&mdash;be-butterflied, and be-fiddled.</P>
<P>The more my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> drank of this &s;weet fountain of &s;cience, the greater was the heat and impatience of his thir&s;t, &s;o that, before the fir&s;t year of his con|finement had well gone round, there was &s;carce a fortified town in <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> of which, by one means or other, he had not procured a plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating there|with the hi&s;tories of their &s;ieges, their de|molitions, their improvements, and new works, all which he would read with that inten&s;e application and delight, that he would forget him&s;elf, his wound, his con|finement, his dinner.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd year my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> pur|cha&s;ed <HI>Ramelli</HI> and <HI>Cataneo,</HI> tran&s;lated
<PB N="21" REF="22">
from the <HI>Italian</HI>;&mdash;likewi&s;e <HI>Stevinus, Marolis,</HI> the Chevalier <HI>de Ville, Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter,</HI> the Count <HI>de Pagan,</HI> the Mar&s;hal <HI>Vauban,</HI> Mon&s;. <HI>Blondel,</HI> with almo&s;t as many more books of military architecture, as Don <HI>Quixote</HI> was found to have of chivalry, when the curate and barber invaded his library.</P>
<P>Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> ninety-nine, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> found it nece&s;&s;ary to un|der&s;tand a little of projectiles:&mdash;And ha|ving judged it be&s;t to draw his know|ledge from the fountain-head, he began with <HI>N. Tartaglia,</HI> who it &s;eems was the fir&s;t man who detected the impo&s;ition of a canon-ball's doing all that mi&s;chief under the notion of a right line.&mdash;This <HI>N. Tartaglia</HI> proved to my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> to be an impo&s;&s;ible thing.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">
&mdash;Endle&s;s is the Search of Truth!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> &s;atisfied which road the cannon-ball did not go, but he was in&s;en&s;ibly led on, and re&s;olved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go: For which purpo&s;e he was obliged to &s;et off afre&s;h with old <HI>Maltus,</HI> and &s;tudied him devout|ly.&mdash;He proceeded next to <HI>Gallileo</HI> and <HI>Torricellius,</HI> wherein, by certain geome|trical rules, infallibly laid down, he found the preci&s;e path to be a PARABOLA,&mdash;or el&s;e an HYPERBOLA,&mdash;and that the pa|rameter, or <HI>latus rectum,</HI> of the conic &s;ec|tion of the &s;aid path, was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct <HI>ratio,</HI> as the whole line to the &s;ine of double the angle of incidence, form'd by the breech upon an horizontal plane;&mdash;and that the &s;emi|parameter,

&mdash;&s;top! my dear uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;&s;top!&mdash;go not one foot further into this thorny and bewilder'd track,&mdash;intricate are the &s;teps! intricate are the ma&s;es of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the pur&s;uit of this bewitch|ing phantom, KNOWLEDGE, will bring upon thee.&mdash;O my uncle! fly&mdash;fly&mdash;fly from it as from a &s;erpent.&mdash;Is it fit, good-natur'd man! thou &s;hould'&s;t fit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchings?&mdash;Alas! 'twill exa&s;perate thy &s;ymptoms,&mdash;check thy per&s;pirations,&mdash;evaporate thy &s;pirits,&mdash;wa&s;te thy animal &s;trength,&mdash;dry up thy radical moi&s;ture,&mdash;bring thee into a co&s;tive habit of body, impair thy health,&mdash;and ha&s;ten all the infirmities of thy old age.&mdash;O my uncle! my uncle <HI>Toby!</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>I Would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does not under&s;tand this,&mdash;That the be&s;t plain narrative in the world, tack'd very clo&s;e to the la&s;t &s;pirited apo&s;trophe to my un|cle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate;&mdash;there|fore I forthwith put an end to the chap|ter,&mdash;though I was in the middle of my &s;tory.</P>
<P>&mdash;Writers of my &s;tamp have one principle in common with painters.&mdash;Where an exact copying makes our pictures le&s;s &s;triking, we choo&s;e the le&s;s evil; deeming it even more pardonable to tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t truth, than beauty.&mdash;This is to be under&s;tood <HI>cum grano &s;alis</HI>;
<PB N="25" REF="26">
but be it as it will,&mdash;as the parallel is made more for the &s;ake of letting the apo&s;trophe cool, than any thing el&s;e,&mdash;'tis not very material whether upon any other &s;core the reader approves of it or not.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the third year, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> perceiving that the parameter and &s;emi-parameter of the conic &s;ection, angered his wound, he left off the &s;tudy of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook him&s;elf to the practical part of fortification only; the plea&s;ure of which, like a &s;pring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.</P>
<P>It was in this year that my uncle be|gan to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean &s;hirt,&mdash;to di&s;mi&s;s his barber un&s;haven,&mdash;and to allow his &s;urgeon
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;carce time &s;ufficient to dre&s;s his wound, concerning him&s;elf &s;o little about it, as not to a&s;k him once in &s;even times dre&s;|&s;ing how it went on: When, lo!&mdash;all of a &s;udden, for the change was as quick as lightening, he began to &s;igh heavily for his recovery,&mdash;complain'd to my father, grew impatient with the &s;urgeon;&mdash;and one morning as he heard his foot com|ing up &s;tairs, he &s;hut up his books, and thru&s;t a&s;ide his in&s;truments, in order to expo&s;tulate with him upon the protrac|tion of his cure, which, he told him, might &s;urely have been accompli&s;hed at lea&s;t by that time:&mdash;He dwelt long upon the mi&s;eries he had undergone, and the &s;orrows of his four years melancholy impri&s;onment;&mdash;adding, that had it not been for the kind looks, and fraternal chearings of the be&s;t of brothers,&mdash;he had long &s;ince &s;unk under his misfor|tunes.

<P>The rea&s;on, or rather the ri&s;e, of this &s;udden demigration, was as follows:</P>

I mu&s;t here inform you, that this &s;er|vant of my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s, who went by the name of <HI>Trim,</HI> had been a Corporal in my uncle's own company,&mdash;his real name was <HI>James Butler,</HI>&mdash;but having got the nick-name of <HI>Trim</HI> in the regi|ment, my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> unle&s;s when he hap|pened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any other name.</P>
<P>The poor fellow had been di&s;abled for the &s;ervice, by a wound on his left knee by a mu&s;ket-bullet, at the battle of <HI>Landen,</HI> which was two years before the affair of <HI>Namur</HI>;&mdash;and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> took him for his &s;ervant, and of ex|cellent u&s;e was he, attending my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> in the camp and in his quarters as valet, groom, barber, cook, &s;emp&s;ter,

<P>IT is about an hour and a half's tole|rable good reading &s;ince my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> rung the bell, when <HI>Obadiah</HI> was order'd to &s;addle a hor&s;e, and go for Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> the man-midwife;&mdash;&s;o that no one can &s;ay, with rea&s;on, that I have not allowed <HI>Obadiah</HI> time enough, poetically &s;peaking, and con&s;idering the emergency too, both to go and come;&mdash;tho', morally and truly &s;peaking, the man, perhaps, has &s;carce had time to get on his boots.</P>

and mea&s;ure the true di&s;tance betwixt the ringing of the bell, and the rap at the door;&mdash;and, after finding it to be no more than two minutes, thirteen &s;econds, and three fifths,&mdash;&s;hould take upon him to in&s;ult over me for &s;uch a breach in the unity, or rather probability, of time;&mdash;I would remind him, that the idea of duration and of its &s;imple modes, is got merely from the train and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of our ideas,&mdash;and is the true &s;cho|la&s;tic pendulum,&mdash;and by which, as a &s;cholar, I will be tried in this matter,&mdash;abjuring and dete&s;ting the juri&s;diction of all other pendulums whatever.</P>

<P>WHEN Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> entered the back-parlour, where my father and my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> were di&s;cour&s;ing upon the na|ture of women,&mdash;it was hard to deter|mine whether Dr. <HI>Slop</HI>'s figure, or Dr. <HI>Slop</HI>'s pre&s;ence, occa&s;ioned more &s;urprize to them; for as the accident happened &s;o near the hou&s;e, as not to make it worth while for <HI>Obadiah</HI> to remou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> him,&mdash;<HI>Obadiah</HI> had led him in as he was, <HI>un|wiped, unappointed, unanealed,</HI> with all his &s;tains and blotches on him.&mdash;He &s;tood like <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s gho&s;t, motionle&s;s and &s;peechle&s;s, for a full minute and a half, at the parlour door (<HI>Obadiah</HI> &s;till hold|ing his hand) with all the maje&s;ty of mud.

<P>Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> to have triumph'd over my father in his turn;&mdash;for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> in that pickle, could have di&s;&s;ented from &s;o much, at lea&s;t, of my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s opinion, "That may-hap his &s;i&s;ter might not care to let &s;uch a Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> come &s;o near her * * * *" But it was the <HI>Argu|mentum ad hominem</HI>; and if my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to u&s;e it.&mdash;No; the rea&s;on was,&mdash;'twas not his na|ture to in&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">
Dr. <HI>Slop</HI>'s pre&s;ence, at that time, was no le&s;s problematical than the mode of it; tho', it is certain, one moment's re|flection in my father might have &s;olved it; for he had apprized Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing &s;ince, 'twas natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to <HI>Shandy-Hall,</HI> as he did, merely to &s;ee how matters went on.</P>
<P>But my father's mind took unfortu|nately a wrong turn in the inve&s;tigation; running, like the hypercritic's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,&mdash;mea&s;uring their di|&s;tance,&mdash;and keeping his mind &s;o intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing el&s;e,&mdash;common-place infirmity of the greate&s;t mathematicians!

<P>AT the end of the la&s;t chapter, my father and my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> were left both &s;tanding, like <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> at the clo&s;e of the &s;cene making up their accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
As my father &s;poke the three la&s;t words,&mdash;he &s;at down;&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order Corporal <HI>Trim,</HI> who was in waiting, to &s;tep home for <HI>Stevinus</HI>;&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s hou&s;e being no further off than the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way.</P>
<P>Some men would have dropp'd the &s;ubject of <HI>Stevinus</HI>;&mdash;but my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had no re&s;entment in his heart, and he went on with the &s;ubject, to &s;hew my father that he had none.</P>
<P>Your &s;udden appearance, Dr. <HI>Slop,</HI> quoth my uncle, re&s;uming the di&s;cour&s;e, in&s;tantly brought <HI>Stevinus</HI> into my head. (My father, you may be &s;ure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon <HI>Ste|vinus</HI>'s head)&mdash;Becau&s;e, continued my
<PB N="87" REF="88">
uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> the celebrated &s;ailing chariot, which belonged to Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and was of &s;uch wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen peo|ple thirty <HI>German</HI> miles, in I don't know how few minutes,&mdash;was invented by <HI>Stevinus,</HI> that great mathematician and engineer.</P>
<P>You might have &s;pared your &s;ervant the trouble, quoth Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> (as the fellow is lame) of going for <HI>Stevinus</HI>'s account of it, becau&s;e, in my return from <HI>Leyden</HI> thro' the <HI>Hague,</HI> I walked as far as <HI>Schev|ling,</HI> which is two long miles, on purpo&s;e to take a view of it.</P>
<P>&mdash;That's nothing, replied my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> to what the learned <HI>Peire&s;kius</HI> did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Schevling,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="89">
and from <HI>Schevling</HI> to <HI>Paris</HI> back again, in order to &s;ee it,&mdash;and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.</P>
<P>The more fool <HI>Peire&s;kius,</HI> replied Dr. <HI>Slop.</HI> But mark, 'twas out of no con|tempt of <HI>Peire&s;kius</HI> at all;&mdash;but that <HI>Peire&s;kius</HI>'s indefatigable labour in trudg|ing &s;o far on foot out of love for the &s;ciences, reduced the exploit of Dr. <HI>Slop,</HI> in that affair, to nothing;&mdash;the more fool <HI>Peire&s;kius,</HI> &s;aid he again:&mdash;Why &s;o?&mdash;replied my father, taking his brother's part, not only to make reparation as fa&s;t as he could for the in&s;ult he had given him, which &s;at &s;till upon my father's mind;&mdash;but partly, that my father began really to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;Why &s;o?&mdash;&s;aid he. Why is <HI>Peire&s;kius,</HI> or any man el&s;e, to be abu&s;ed for an ap|petite
<PB N="89" REF="90">
for that, or any other mor&s;el of &s;ound knowledge? For, notwith&s;tand|ing I know nothing of the chariot in que&s;tion, continued he, the inventor of it mu&s;t have had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot gue&s;s upon what prin|ciples of philo&s;ophy he has atchiev'd it;&mdash;yet certainly his machine has been con&s;tructed upon &s;olid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have an&s;wer'd at the rate my brother mentions.</P>
<P>It an&s;wered, replied my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> as well, if not better; for, as <HI>Peire&s;kius</HI> elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, &s;peaking of the velocity of its motion, <HI>Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus</HI>; which, unle&s;s I have forgot my Latin, is, <HI>that it was as &s;wift as the wind it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
But pray, Dr. <HI>Slop,</HI> quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not with|out begging pardon for it, at the &s;ame time) upon what principles was this &s;elf|&s;ame chariot &s;et a-going?&mdash;Upon very pretty principles to be &s;ure, replied Dr. <HI>Slop</HI>;&mdash;and I have often wondered, continued he, evading the que&s;tion, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this of ours,&mdash;(e&s;pecially they who&s;e wives are not pa&s;t child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon &s;udden calls, to which the &s;ex is &s;ubject,&mdash;if the wind only &s;erved,&mdash;but would be excellent good hu&s;bandry to make u&s;e of the winds, which co&s;t no|thing, and which eat nothing, rather than hor&s;es, which (the devil take 'em) both co&s;t and eat a great deal.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
For that very rea&s;on, replied my fa|ther, "Becau&s;e they co&s;t nothing, and becau&s;e they eat nothing,"&mdash;the &s;cheme is bad;&mdash;it is the con&s;umption of our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade,&mdash;brings in money, and &s;upports the value of our lands;&mdash;and tho', I own, if I was a prince, I would generou&s;ly recompen&s;e the &s;cientific head which brought forth &s;uch contrivances;&mdash;yet I would as peremptorily &s;uppre&s;s the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>My father here had got into his ele|ment,&mdash;and was going on as pro|&s;perou&s;ly with his di&s;&s;ertation upon trade, as my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had before, upon his of fortification;&mdash;but, to the lo&s;s of much &s;ound knowledge, the de&s;tinies in the morning had decreed that no

He &s;tood before them with his body &s;wayed, and bent forwards ju&s;t &s;o far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon;&mdash;which &s;ound orators, to whom I addre&s;s this, know very well, to be the true per|&s;ua&s;ive angle of incidence;&mdash;in any other angle you may talk and preach;&mdash;'tis certain,&mdash;and it is done every day;&mdash;but with what effect,&mdash;I leave the world to judge!</P>

of the line of &s;cience too;&mdash;for con&s;ider, it had one eighth part of his body to bear up;&mdash;&s;o that in this ca&s;e the po&s;i|tion of the leg is determined,&mdash;becau&s;e the foot could be no further advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him mechanically, to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it,&mdash;and to carry it too.</P>

<P>I Have dropp'd the curtain over this &s;cene for a minute,&mdash;to remind you of one thing,&mdash;and to inform you of an|other.</P>
<P>What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due cour&s;e;&mdash;for it &s;hould have been told a hundred and
<PB N="160" REF="161">
fifty pages ago, but that I fore&s;aw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more advantage here than el&s;ewhere.&mdash;Writers had need look before them to keep up the &s;pirit and connection of what they have in hand.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is this;&mdash;that from the &s;pecimens of &s;ingularity in my father's notions in the point of Chri&s;tian-names, and that other point previous thereto,&mdash;you was led, I think, into an opinion, (and I am &s;ure I &s;aid as much) that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd
<PB N="161" REF="162">
and whim&s;ical in fifty other opinions.

<P>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Shandy,</HI> my father, Sir, would &s;ee nothing in the light in which others placed it;&mdash;he placed things in his own light;&mdash;he would weigh nothing in com|mon &s;cales;&mdash;no,&mdash;he was too refined a re&s;earcher to lay open to &s;o gro&s;s an im|po&s;ition.&mdash;To come at the exact weight of things in the &s;cientific &s;teel-yard, the fulcrum, he would &s;ay, &s;hould be almo&s;t invi&s;ible, to avoid all friction from po|pular tenets;&mdash;without this the minutiae
<PB N="162" REF="163">
of philo&s;ophy, which &s;hould always turn the balance, will have no weight at all.&mdash;Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm, was divi&s;ible <HI>in infinitum</HI>;&mdash;that the grains and &s;cruples were as much a part of it, as the gravitation of the whole world.&mdash;In a word, he would &s;ay, error was error,&mdash;no matter where it fell,&mdash;whether in a fraction,&mdash;or a pound,&mdash;'twas alike fatal to truth, and &s;he was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mi&s;take in the du&s;t of a butterfly's wing,&mdash;as in the di&s;k of the &s;un, the moon, and all the &s;tars of heaven put together.</P>
<P>He would often lament that it was for want of con&s;idering this properly, and of applying it &s;kilfully to civil matters, as well as to &s;peculative truths, that &s;o many things in this world were out of joint;&mdash;that the political arch was giving way;&mdash;
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and that the very foundations of our ex|cellent con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, were &s;o &s;app'd as e&s;timators had reported.</P>

<P>'Tis the &s;ame, he would &s;ay, through|out the whole circle of the &s;ciences;&mdash;
<PB N="164" REF="165">
the great, the e&s;tabli&s;hed points of them, are not to be broke in upon.&mdash;The laws of nature will defend them&s;elves;&mdash;but error&mdash;(he would add, looking earne&s;tly at my mother)&mdash;error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute holes, and &s;mall crevices, which human nature leaves unguarded.</P>
<P>This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you of:&mdash;The point you are to be informed of, and which I have re&s;erved for this place, is as follows:</P>
<P>Among&s;t the many and excellent rea|&s;ons, with which my father had urged my mother to accept of Dr. <HI>Slop</HI>'s a&s;|&s;i&s;tance preferably to that of the old wo|man,&mdash;there was one of a very &s;ingular nature; which, when he had done ar|guing the matter with her as a Chri&s;tian, and came to argue it over again with her
<PB N="165" REF="166">
as a philo&s;opher, he had put his whole &s;trength to, depending indeed upon it as his &s;heet anchor.&mdash;It failed him; tho' from no defect in the argument it&s;elf; but that, do what he could, he was not able for his &s;oul to make her comprehend the drift of it.&mdash;Cur&s;ed luck!&mdash;&s;aid he to him&s;elf, one afternoon, as he walk'd out of the room, after he had been &s;ta|ting it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of purpo&s;e;&mdash;cur&s;ed luck! &s;aid he, biting his lip as he &s;hut the door,&mdash;for a man to be ma&s;ter of one of the fine&s;t chains of rea&s;oning in nature,&mdash;and have a wife at the &s;ame time with &s;uch a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a &s;ingle inference within &s;ide of it, to &s;ave his &s;oul from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This argument, tho' it was intirely lo&s;t upon my mother,&mdash;had more weight with
<PB N="166" REF="167">
him, than all his other arguments joined together:&mdash;I will therefore endeavour to do it ju&s;tice,&mdash;and &s;et it forth with all the per&s;picuity I am ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>My father &s;et out upon the &s;trength of the&s;e two following axioms:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a tun of other peoples; and,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> (Which, by the bye, was the ground-work of the fir&s;t axiom,&mdash;tho' it comes la&s;t) That every man's wit mu&s;t come from every man's own &s;oul,&mdash;and no other body's.</P>
<P>Now, as it was plain to my father, that all &s;ouls were by nature equal,&mdash;and that the great difference between the mo&s;t acute and the mo&s;t obtu&s;e under&s;tanding,
<PB N="167" REF="168">
&mdash;was from no original &s;harpne&s;s or bluntne&s;s of one thinking &s;ub&s;tance above or below another,&mdash;but aro&s;e merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the &s;oul princi|pally took up her re&s;idence,&mdash;he had made it the &s;ubject of his enquiry to find out the identical place.</P>
<P>Now, from the be&s;t accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he was &s;atisfied it could not be where <HI>Des Cartes</HI> had fixed it, upon the top of the <HI>pineal</HI> gland of the brain; which, as he philo|&s;ophi&s;ed, formed a cu&s;hion for her about the &s;ize of a marrow pea; tho' to &s;peak the truth, as &s;o many nerves did terminate all in that one place,&mdash;'twas no bad con|jecture;&mdash;and my father had certainly fallen with that great philo&s;opher plumb into the center of the mi&s;take, had it not
<PB N="168" REF="169">
been for my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> who re&s;cued him out of it, by a &s;tory he told him of a <HI>Walloon</HI> officer at the battle of <HI>Landen,</HI> who had one part of his brain &s;hot away by a mu&s;ket-ball,&mdash;and another part of it taken out after by a <HI>French</HI> &s;urgeon; and, after all, recovered, and did his duty very well without it.</P>
<P>If death, &s;aid my father, rea&s;oning with him&s;elf, is nothing but the &s;eparation of the &s;oul from the body;&mdash;and if it is true that people can walk about and do their bu&s;ine&s;s without brains,&mdash;then certes the &s;oul does not inhabit there. Q. E. D.</P>
<P>As for that certain, very thin, &s;ubtle, and very fragrant juice which <HI>Coglioni&s;&s;imo Borri,</HI> the great <HI>Milaneze</HI> phy&s;ician, af|firms, in a letter to <HI>Bartholine,</HI> to have di&s;|covered in the cellulae of the occipital parts
<PB N="169" REF="170">
of the cerebellum, and which he likewi&s;e affirms to be the principal &s;eat of the rea|&s;onable &s;oul (for, you mu&s;t know, in the&s;e latter and more enlightened ages, there are two &s;ouls in every man living,&mdash;the one, according to the great <HI>Metheglingius,</HI> being called the <HI>Animus,</HI> the other the <HI>Anima</HI>);&mdash;as for this opinion, I &s;ay, of <HI>Borri,</HI>&mdash;my father could never &s;ub&s;cribe to it by any means; the very idea of &s;o noble, &s;o refined, &s;o immaterial, and &s;o ex|alted a being as the <HI>Anima,</HI> or even the <HI>Ani|mus,</HI> taking up her re&s;idence, and &s;itting dabbling, like a tad-pole, all day long, both &s;ummer and winter, in a puddle,&mdash;or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or thin &s;oever, he would &s;ay, &s;hock'd his imagination; he would &s;carce give the doctrine a hearing.</P>
<P>What, therefore, &s;eem'd the lea&s;t liable to objections of any, was, that the chief
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;en&s;orium, or head-quarters of the &s;oul, and to which place all intelligences were referred, and from whence all her man|dates were i&s;&s;ued,&mdash;was in, or near, the cerebellum,&mdash;or rather &s;ome-where about the <HI>medulla oblongata,</HI> wherein it was ge|nerally agreed by <HI>Dutch</HI> anatomi&s;ts, that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the &s;even &s;en&s;es concentered, like &s;treets and winding alleys, into a &s;quare.</P>
<P>So far there was nothing &s;ingular in my father's opinion,&mdash;he had the be&s;t of philo&s;ophers, of all ages and climates, to go along with him.&mdash;But here he took a road of his own, &s;etting up another <HI>Shan|dean</HI> hypothe&s;is upon the&s;e corner-&s;tones they had laid for him;&mdash;and which &s;aid hypothe&s;is equally &s;tood its ground; whe|ther the &s;ubtilty and finene&s;s of the &s;oul depended upon the temperature and clear|ne&s;s
<PB N="171" REF="172">
of the &s;aid liquor, or of the finer net-work and texture in the cerebellum it&s;elf; which opinion he favoured.</P>
<P>He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propaga|tion of each individual, which required all the thought in the world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehen&s;ible contexture in which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is u&s;ually meant by the name of good natural parts, do con|&s;i&s;t;&mdash;that next to this and his Chri&s;tian|name, which were the two original and mo&s;t efficacious cau&s;es of all;&mdash;that the third cau&s;e, or rather what logicians call the <HI>Cau&s;a &s;ine qu&acirc; non,</HI> and without which all that was done was of no manner of &s;ignificance,&mdash;was the pre&s;ervation of this delicate and fine-&s;pun web, from the ha|vock which was generally made in it by
<PB N="172" REF="173">
the violent compre&s;&s;ion and cru&s;h which the head was made to undergo, by the non&s;en&s;ical method of bringing us into the world by that part foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>&mdash;This requires explanation.</P>
<P>My father, who dipp'd into all kinds of books, upon looking into <HI>Lithopaedus Senone&s;is de Partu difficili</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author is here twice mi&s;taken;&mdash;for <HI>Lithopaedus</HI> &s;hould be wrote thus, <HI>Lithopaedii Seno|nen&s;is Icon.</HI> The &s;econd mi&s;take is, that this <HI>Li|thopaedus</HI> is not an author, but a drawing of a petrified child.

<PB N="173" REF="174">
<HI>Adrianus Smelvgot,</HI> had found out, That the lax and pliable &s;tate of a child's head in parturition, the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time, was &s;uch,&mdash;that by force of the woman's efforts, which, in &s;trong labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to a weight of 470 pounds averdupoi&s;e acting per|pendicularly upon it;&mdash;it &s;o happened that, in 49 in&s;tances out of 50, the &s;aid head was compre&s;&s;ed and moulded into the &s;hape of an oblong conical piece of dough, &s;uch as a pa&s;try-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of.&mdash;Good God! cried my father, what ha|vock and de&s;truction mu&s;t this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum!&mdash;Or if there is &s;uch a juice as <HI>Borri</HI> pretends,&mdash;is it not enough to make the cleare&s;t liquor in the world both feculent and mothery?</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">
But how great was his apprehen&s;ion, when he further under&s;tood, that this force, acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only injured the brain it&s;elf or cerebrum,&mdash;but that it nece&s;&s;arily &s;queez'd and propell'd the cerebrum to|wards the cerebellum, which was the im|mediate &s;eat of the under&s;tanding.&mdash;Angels and Mini&s;ters of grace defend us! cried my father,&mdash;can any &s;oul with&s;tand this &s;hock?&mdash;No wonder the intellectual web is &s;o rent and tatter'd as we &s;ee it; and that &s;o many of our be&s;t heads are no better than a puzzled &s;kein of &s;ilk,&mdash;all perplexity,&mdash;all confu&s;ion within &s;ide.</P>
<P>But when my father read on, and was let into the &s;ecret, that when a child was turn'd top&s;y-turvy, which was ea&s;y for an operator to do, and was extracted by the feet;&mdash;that in&s;tead of the cerebrum
<PB N="175" REF="176">
being propell'd towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on the contrary, was pro|pell'd &s;imply towards the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurt:&mdash;By heavens! cried he, the world is in a con|&s;piracy to drive out what little wit God has given us,&mdash;and the profe&s;&s;ors of the ob&s;tetric art are li&s;ted into the &s;ame con|&s;piracy.&mdash;What is it to me which end of my &s;on comes foremo&s;t into the world, provided all goes right after, and his ce|rebellum e&s;capes uncru&s;hed?</P>
<P>It is the nature of an hypothe&s;is, when once a man has conceived it, that it a&s;&s;i|milates every thing to it&s;elf as proper nouri&s;hment; and, from the fir&s;t moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the &s;tronger by every thing you &s;ee, hear, read, or under&s;tand. This is of great u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="177">
When my father was gone with this about a month, there was &s;carce a phae|nomenon of &s;tupidity or of genius, which he could not readily &s;olve by it;&mdash;it ac|counted for the elde&s;t &s;on being the great|e&s;t blockhead in the family.&mdash;Poor devil, he would &s;ay,&mdash;he made way for the capa|city of his younger brothers.&mdash;It unriddled the ob&s;ervation of drivellers and mon&s;trous heads,&mdash;&s;hewing, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> it could not be otherwi&s;e,&mdash;unle&s;s * * * * I don't know what. It wonderfully explain'd and ac|counted for the acumen of the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> ge|nius, and that &s;prightlier turn, and a more penetrating intuition of minds, in warmer climates; not from the loo&s;e and common-place &s;olution of a clearer &s;ky, and a more perpetual &s;un-&s;hine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;which, for aught he knew, might as well rarify and dilute the faculties of the &s;oul into nothing, by one extreme,&mdash;as they
<PB N="177" REF="178">
are conden&s;ed in colder climates by the other;&mdash;but he traced the affair up to its &s;pring-head;&mdash;&s;hew'd that, in warmer climates, nature had laid a lighter tax upon the faire&s;t parts of the creation;&mdash;their plea&s;ures more;&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of their pains le&s;s, in&s;omuch that the pre&s;|&s;ure and re&s;i&s;tance upon the vertex was &s;o &s;light, that the whole organization of the cerebellum was pre&s;erved;&mdash;nay, he did not believe, in natural births, that &s;o much as a &s;ingle thread of the net-work was broke or di&s;placed,&mdash;&s;o that the &s;oul might ju&s;t act as &s;he liked.</P>
<P>When my father had got &s;o far,&mdash;what a blaze of light did the accounts of the <HI>Cae&s;arian</HI> &s;ection, and of the towering geniu&s;es who had come &s;afe into the world by it, ca&s;t upon this hypothe&s;is?

<P>This inci&s;ion of the <HI>abdomen</HI> and <HI>ute|rus,</HI> ran for &s;ix weeks together in my fa|ther's head;&mdash;he had read, and was &s;atis|fied, that wounds in the <HI>epiga&s;trium,</HI> and tho&s;e in the <HI>matrix,</HI> were not mortal;&mdash;&s;o that the belly of the mother might be

<P>This was my father Mr. <HI>Shandy</HI>'s hypo|the&s;is; concerning which I have only to add, that my brother <HI>Bobby</HI> did as great honour to it (whatever he did to the fa|mily) as any one of the great heroes we &s;poke of:&mdash;For happening not only to be chri&s;ten'd, as I told you, but to be born too, when my father was at <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI>&mdash;being moreover my mother's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> child,&mdash;coming into the world with his head <HI>foremo&s;t,</HI>&mdash;and turning out afterwards a

<P>This was not to be expected from one of the &s;i&s;terhood, who are not ea&s;ily to be put out of their way,&mdash;and was therefore one of my father's great rea&s;ons in favour of a man of &s;cience, whom he could bet|ter deal with.</P>
<P>Of all men in the world, Dr. <HI>Slop</HI> was the fitte&s;t for my father's purpo&s;e;&mdash;for though his new-invented forceps was the armour he had proved, and what he maintained, to be the &s;afe&s;t in&s;trument of deliverance,&mdash;yet, it &s;eems, he had &s;cat|tered a word or two in his book, in fa|vour of the very thing which ran in my father's fancy;&mdash;tho' not with a view to the &s;oul's good in extracting by the feet,
