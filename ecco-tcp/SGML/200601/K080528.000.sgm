<L>I Come not here your Candour to implore</L>
<L>For Scenes, who&s;e Author is, alas! no more;</L>
<L>He wants no Advocate his Cau&s;e to plead;</L>
<L>You will your&s;elves be Patrons of the Dead.</L>
<L>No Party his Benevolence confin'd</L>
<L>No Sect&mdash;alike it flow'd to all Mankind.</L>
<L>He lov'd his Friends (forgive this gu&s;hing Tear:</L>
<L>Alas! I feel I am no Actor here)</L>
<L>He lov'd his Friends with &s;uch a Warmth of Heart,</L>
<L>So clear of Int're&s;t, &s;o devoid of Art,</L>
<L>Such generous Freedom, &s;uch un&s;haken Zeal,</L>
<L>No Words can &s;peak it, but our Tears may tell.&mdash;</L>
<L>O candid Truth, O Faith without a Stain,</L>
<L>O Manners gently firm, and nobly plain,</L>
<L>O &s;ympathizing Love of others Bli&s;s,</L>
<L>Where will you find another Brea&s;t like His?&mdash;</L>
<L>Such was the Man&mdash;the Poet well you know:</L>
<L>Oft has he touch'd your Hearts with tender Woe:</L>
<L>Oft in this crouded Hou&s;e with ju&s;t Applau&s;e</L>
<L>You heard him teach fair Virtue's pure&s;t Laws;</L>
<L>For his cha&s;te Mu&s;e employ'd her Heav'n-taught Lyre</L>
<L>None but the noble&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions to in&s;pire,</L>
<L>Not one immoral, one corrupted Thought,</L>
<L>One Line, which dying he could wi&s;h to blot.</L>
<L>Oh may To-night your favourable Doom</L>
<L>Another Laurel add to grace his Tomb:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t he, &s;uperior now to Prai&s;e or Blame,</L>
<L>Hears net the feeble Voice of Human Fame.</L>
<L><PB REF="22">
Yet if to tho&s;e whom mo&s;t on Earth he lov'd,</L>
<L>From whom his pious Care is now remov'd,</L>
<L>With whom his liberal Hand, and bounteous Heart</L>
<L>Shar'd all his little Fortune could impart,</L>
<L>If to tho&s;e Friends your kind Regard &s;hall give</L>

<L>Pardon me, TULLUS, if my faithful Bluntne&s;s</L>
<L>Deems you too lib'ral in his Prai&s;e. In Peace,</L>
<L>Such may perhaps do well, when Prating rules</L>
<L>An idle World; but in tempe&s;tuous Times</L>
<L>They are &s;tark naught, the&s;e vi&s;ionary State&s;men,</L>

<L>The <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, who&s;e attentive Caution</L>
<L>Watch'd all our Motions, took at once th' Alarm</L>

<L>With formal Ceremony, to demand</L>
<L>The Cau&s;e of our Approach.&mdash;Had I been Ma&s;ter,</L>
<L>I would have an&s;wer'd at the Gates of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>

<L>His Freedman, TITUS, to be &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI></L>
<L>With our Demands. If the&s;e the Senate grants,</L>
<L>We then are in the Toils of Peace entangled,</L>

Mrs. WOFFINGTON.</STAGE>
<L>WELL! Gentlemen! and are you &s;till &s;o vain</L>
<L>To treat our Sex with arrogant Di&s;dain,</L>
<L>And think, to you alone by partial Heav'n</L>
<L>Superior Sen&s;e and &s;overeign Pow'r are given.</L>
<L>When in the Story told To-night, you find,</L>
<L>With what a boundle&s;s Sway we rule the Mind,</L>
<L>And, by a few &s;oft Words of ours, with Ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Can turn the proude&s;t Hearts ju&s;t where we plea&s;e?</L>
<L>If an old Mother had &s;uch pow'rful Charms,&mdash;</L>
<L>To &s;top a &s;tubborn <HI>Roman</HI>'s conquering Arms,&mdash;</L>
<L>Soldiers and State&s;men of the&s;e Days, with you</L>
<L>What think you wou'd a fair young Mi&s;tre&s;s do?</L>
<L>If with my grave Di&s;cour&s;e, and wrinkled Face,</L>
<L>I thus could bring a Hero to Di&s;grace,</L>
<L>How ab&s;olutely may I hope to reign</L>
<L>Now I am turn'd to my own Shape again !</L>
<L>However, I will u&s;e my Empire well;</L>
<L>And, if I have a certain magic Spell</L>
<L><PB REF="70">
Or in my Tongue, or Wit, or Shape, or Eyes,</L>
<L>Which can &s;ubdue the Strong, and fool the Wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Be not alarm'd: I will not interfere</L>
<L>In State-Affairs, nor undertake to &s;teer,</L>
<L>The Helm of Government,&mdash;as we are told</L>
<L>Tho&s;e Female Politicians did of old:</L>
<L>Such dangerous Heights I never wi&s;h'd to climb&mdash;</L>
<L>Thank Heav'n! I better can employ my Time&mdash;</L>
<L>A&s;k you to what my Pow'r I &s;hall apply?</L>
<L>To make my Subjects ble&s;t, is my Reply.</L>
<L>My Purpo&s;es are gracious all, and kind,</L>
<L>Some may be told&mdash;and &s;ome may be divin'd:</L>
<L>One, which at pre&s;ent I have mo&s;t at Heart,</L>
<L>To you without Re&s;erve I will impart:</L>
<L>It is my Sovereign Will,&mdash;Hear, and obey,&mdash;</L>
<L>That you with Candour treat this <HI>Orphan Play.</HI></L>
