<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ADre&s;&s;es of this nature are but
too often Petitions for Favours
to come. But the Intention
of this is to return thanks to your
Grace for the Favour you did me the
Honour to confer upon me in <HI>Novem|ber</HI>
la&s;t. Your Grace, perhaps, may
inclin'd to believe, that my Ac|knowledgment
comes &s;omewhat of the
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
late&s;t. I therefore being concern'd to
vindicate the Reputation of my Gra|titude,
take the Liberty to a&s;&s;ure your
Grace, that I knew nothing certainly
of the Favour, which by your Order
was conferr'd upon me in <HI>November</HI>
la&s;t, till within this Fortnight. And
as I had heard nothing certain of it,
till &s;o long after your Grace had com|manded
it; for that very Rea&s;on, I had
believ'd nothing of it, when I did hear
of it, if a Gentleman of undoubted
Honour had not a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he
was pre&s;ent, when you were pleas'd to
give Directions about it. As I knew
nothing of it till within this Fortnight,
&s;o all I know of it now, is the a&s;&s;urance
which that Gentleman has given me
that your Grace has ordered it. For,
tho, depending upon that Gentleman's
Honour and his Integrity, I have en|deavour'd
to have Evidence of Sen&s;e
in the Ca&s;e, as much as I could en|deavour
it with any manner of De|cency,
and without &s;ubjecting my &s;elf
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
to be treated, in my Me&s;&s;engers, with
repeated and intolerable In&s;olence, by
that Servant who receiv'd your Grace's
Command, to convey your Favour to
me, I have found to my infinite Sur|prize,
that, at the very time that I
have been, labouring to unmask and
expo&s;e an Hypocritical, Wretch, who
has had the Impudence and the Ingra|titude
publickly to affront your Grace,
as far, as Animals of his Species can
affront you; at that very time one of
your own Dome&s;tick Servants, your
errant Creature, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entirely
by your Bounty, has been diligent
and indu&s;trious, in giving me all the
Di&s;appointment, and all the Di&s;tur|bance,
that, it has been in his, Power
to give me; and con&s;equently all the
Diver&s;ion that he could po&s;&s;ibly give
me in favour of your Grace's declar'd
and mortal Enemy.</P>
<P>But as your Grace's conferring this
Favour con&s;i&s;ted in your ordering it to
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
be done, and not in my receiving
it, I am obliged to return you my
humble Thanks for it, as much as if
I were in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>I am Very &s;orry that upon Addre&s;|&s;ing
my &s;elf twice to your Grace af|ter
this manner, I have been oblig'd
each time, to make a Complaint to
you. But I cannot ab&s;olutely de&s;|pair
of your Pardon for it, when I
con&s;ider that your Grace's Honour has
been more concern'd in each Com|plaint
than any Inrere&s;t of mine. Since
I made the fir&s;t Complaint to you,
I have had the Satisfaction to &s;ee, that
your Grace has retriev'd the Juri&s;di|ction
over our <HI>Theatres,</HI> which is an|nex'd
to your Office, as <HI>Lord Chamber|lain</HI>
of his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Hou&s;hold;</HI> and
have had the Plea&s;ure to hear that
you have mortify'd four In&s;olent Wret|ches,
who had dar'd to u&s;urp it from
you.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="7">
As for the Complaint which I lay
before you at pre&s;ent, I mu&s;t leave it
to be determin'd by your Grace's Wi&s;|dom
and Ju&s;tice, whether the In&s;olence
of the late <HI>Separate Mini&s;try,</HI> whether
the In&s;olence of Sir <HI>John Edgar</HI> him|&s;elf,
was ever &s;o flagrant or &s;o in&s;up|portable,
as that of your Dome&s;tick
and Menial Servant, who has pre&s;um'd
to abu&s;e your Grace's Service in the
mo&s;t Injurious Manner; to treat a Per|&s;on
in&s;olently, whom you had treated
favourably; to intercept and retain
your Favour, and betray the Tru&s;t
repos'd in him, and to controul you
in your very Domain; where becau&s;e
you are mo&s;t independent, you ought
to be mo&s;t uncontroulable.</P>
<P>My Lord, if your Grace &s;hould be
in the lea&s;t &s;urpriz'd at the uncom|mon
Method of conveying this Com|plaint
to you, I am inclin'd to believe
that you will have the Goodne&s;s to
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
con&s;ider, that the &s;ubject Matter of it
is a great deal more &s;trange and more
extraordinary, than the manner of con|veying
it to you. For I appeal to all
tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Condition, who have
been us'd to receive Addre&s;&s;es of this
nature, if they ever knew, or ever
heard of any thing like it, in any of
their Servants before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I had a great deal of Rea|&s;on
to believe, that I had no other
way of approaching your Grace. For
he who has had the A&s;&s;urance for
four Months together, to intercept and
retain your Grace's Favour, would
certainly have ventur'd to intercept
any Letter that &s;hould have come
from me, or to hinder my having any
per&s;onal Acce&s;s to you. But I believe
he dare hardly do that by the little
Book to which this is prefix'd, and
which I have here the Honour to &s;end
you. If his Pre&s;umption &s;hould ex|tend
&s;o far, my Comfort is, that your
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
Grace will hear of the Contents of
this Epi&s;tle from a Hundred of your
Humble Servants.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. TO Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear KNIGHT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SINCE I perceive that there is like
to be a long Commerce of Paper
Civilities between us two, I think
we could not do better, for the mak|ing
the Corre&s;pondence perfectly
ea&s;ie to us both, than to continue, as we have
begun, to throw off all manner of Ceremony,
and to treat each other with that Familiarity,
which is &s;o becoming our long and old Acquain|tance.
This is then one branch of the Cartel
e&s;tabli&s;h'd between us, that thou &s;hould'&s;t &s;eem
not to remember that the King has made me a
Gentleman, and that I &s;hould not fail to forget
that he ever made thee a Knight. So that for
the future I &s;hall be downright <HI>What d'ye call</HI>
with thee; and thou my dear Knight &s;halt be
plain <HI>Jack Edgar</HI> with me. In which branch of
the Cartel, thou ha&s;t by much the Advantage
of me. For my diminutive Honour was e&s;ta|bli&s;hd
by no le&s;s than two Patents, the one
granted by the late Queen, and the other by His
<PB N="2" REF="11">
pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; whereas thine was conferr'd
only by a tran&s;itory Blow given upon Shoulder-blade;
which when &s;ome jeering malicious Per|&s;ons
heard of, they &s;aid, they rejoyc'd that Ho|nour
was got &s;o near as within a Foot of thy
<HI>Pericranium.</HI></P>
<P>But now to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s; how agreea|bly
was I &s;urpriz'd with that notable Di&s;tinction
in the beginning of thy eleventh Paper, which
makes thy Apology for thy going by an <HI>Alias.</HI>
And that is, that when a Man goes by an <HI>alias,</HI> in
order to commit a Robbery, or a Murther, or lye,
with his Neighbour's Wife, why that is not &s;o
well: But when an old Soldier of the Queen
takes up a <HI>nom-de-guerre,</HI> only for the promotion of
Virtue; why that is a laudable Action. Now here
cannot I forbear for my Life u&s;ing the &s;ame ex|pre&s;&s;ion
to you, which was formerly us'd to an|other
old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thra&s;o</HI> in the Eunuch of <HI>Terence.</HI></NOTE> Soldier. <HI>D&icirc; vo&s;tram Fidem! Quanti
e&s;t &s;apere! Nunquam accedo, Quin abs te abeam Do|ctior.</HI>
For my part, I have all along been weak
enough to believe, that to go by an <HI>alias</HI> is a ma|nife&s;t
Cheat, and that every Impo&s;tor means In|tere&s;t
and not Virtue. But this notable Di&s;tin|ction
has almo&s;t convinced me, that if the writer
of a Libel puts but a &s;ham Name to it, he has a
Di&s;pen&s;ation by that <HI>alias</HI> to injure, &s;lander, and
threaten all that is Powerful and Noble in <HI>Great
Britain.</HI> But that if any one pretends to write
ev'n a ju&s;t Satire, upon the vile&s;t Poeta&s;ter
or Politica&s;ter, between <HI>Dover</HI> and the <HI>Orcades</HI>
without putting any Name at all to it; why the
Action is abominable, it cries aloud for the ex|treme&s;t
Vengeance, and de&s;erves Death without
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Mercy. But, hone&s;t <HI>Jack Edgar,</HI> I have one
&s;cruple in my Head. <HI>Boileau</HI> was certainly a
Man of true Judgment, of nice Honour and a
very ju&s;t and admirable Satiri&s;t. His Cen&s;ures
were always ju&s;t, and &s;o were his Prai&s;es, if you
except a very few addre&s;t to his Great Monarch.
Merit and Virtue were always Sacred to him,
and Vice and Folly the objects of his Scorn and
Hatred. Now when he publi&s;h'd a Book of Sa|tires,
which were chiefly levell'd at the <HI>Edgars</HI> and
<HI>Iron&s;ides,</HI> who flouri&s;h'd then at <HI>Paris,</HI> that is, at a
number of Coxcombs who dar'd to appear upon
<HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> without any lawful Summons thither,
or in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> without either Genius or
Judgment, you know very well, <HI>Jack Edgar,</HI> that
he put no name to his Book.</P>
<P>The violence and virulence of the contending
Parties in <HI>England,</HI> have, I am afraid, been one
great cau&s;e, why we have had no ju&s;t Satire in
<HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the Author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> publi&s;h'd
his, which &s;eems to me, to be a very ju&s;t one on
Hypocri&s;y. But you are not to be told, that the
Author of it put no Name to it. We have &s;ince
had Libels which have pa&s;s'd for Satires, as <HI>Ab&s;a|lom</HI>
and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> the <HI>Medal, Mac Fleckno,</HI> and the
<HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary.</HI> They are indeed, if you plea&s;e,
beautiful Libels, but they are every where full
of Flattery or Slander, and a ju&s;t Satire admits
of neither. In the two fir&s;t, how many were
abus'd only for being true to the Religion and
Liberties of their Country? And on the other
&s;ide, &s;ome were extoll'd only for being fal&s;e to
both. The attempt to le&s;&s;en <HI>Shadwell</HI> in <HI>Mack|flecno,</HI>
is every whit as unworthy of Satire. For
<HI>Shadwell</HI> pretended to no Species of Poetry but
the Comick, in which he was certainly very
much &s;uperiour to <HI>Dryden;</HI> as the latter acknow|ledges
<PB N="4" REF="13">
by a very fair implication in his <HI>Preface</HI> to
the <HI>State of Innocence,</HI> which was writ before
the Quarrel between them began. The bu&s;ine&s;s
of Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI> was to ex|po&s;e
much better Physicians than him&s;elf, for no
other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they were not of his Opi|nion
in the affair of the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary.</HI> Now tho'
the&s;e were Libels, and very injurious, yet the
Authors ju&s;tly thought it more creditable to &s;uf|fer
them to be publi&s;h'd without any Name ra|ther
than to make u&s;e of fal&s;e ones.</P>
<P>I am heartily glad, my dear Friend, that I
have pleas'd thee &s;o, by &s;aying that thou ha&s;t
done more harm to the Stage, than any hundred
Men in all <HI>England.</HI> For &s;ay'&s;t thou, the World
is &s;o Wicked, that tis hardly a Di&s;paragement to
be great ev'n in Ill. But I am afraid, hone&s;t <HI>Jack,</HI>
thou mi&s;take&s;t me. For when I accus'd thee of
doing this harm to the Stage, I did not affirm,
that thou did&s;t it altogether through a &s;ini&s;ter De|&s;ign,
or a wicked Motive of Intere&s;t; but that
there was always a mixture with the other two,
of want of Knowledge and Judgment. And
tho' it may be reputable in this wicked World to
be great in Ill, I believe it will hardly ever
be creditable to be great in Folly. I do not &s;ay,
but that there may be a very wi&s;e Man, who
may know nothing of Theatrical matters. But
then this Per&s;on who does not know them, mu&s;t
not pretend to know them, nor to dictate to the
World in an affair which he does not at all un|der&s;tand.
For there is a wi&s;e and a knowing Ig|norance,
an Ignorance that reflects upon its &s;elf,
and re&s;trains him who has it from expo&s;ing or
hurting him&s;elf or others, by undertaking things
which he does not in the lea&s;t under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">
And now, my dear Friend, thou art for mount|ing
that War Hor&s;e a-fre&s;h, from which I &s;hew'd
thee de&s;cending. Methinks I &s;ee thee upon him
in all thy Accoutrements, thy cock'd Hat, thy
broad Sword, thy Shoulder Belt, and thy Jack
Boots, and a hugeous merry Figure thou make&s;t
upon him. But when thou talke&s;t of planting
thy &s;elf behind King <HI>William</HI> the Third, again&s;t
<HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, does not thy Memory fail
thee a little? If thou meane&s;t planting thy &s;elf
behind the Coach of King <HI>William,</HI> I have no|thing
to &s;ay again&s;t that. But I never heard a
great deal of thy attendance on him, when he
got on Hor&s;e-back. He &s;eldom <HI>held</HI> the Honour
of thy Company, to expre&s;s my &s;elf in the quaint
Dialect of thy elder Brother of <HI>Brentford,</HI> either
on the <HI>Boyne</HI> or the <HI>Shannon,</HI> or the <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> or the
<HI>Sambre.</HI> Thou had&s;t that aver&s;ion for the effu|&s;ion
of Chri&s;tian Blood, that rather than go into
the Field with thy broad Sword, and thy dead
doing Hand, to make piteous Slaughter of the
Enemy, thou mad'&s;t it thy choice to &s;tay here at
Home, and make wicked Jokes with thy <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Goo&s;e Quill, upon the Funerals of thy Friends.</P>
<P>But here my dear Friend, thou art in a terri|ble
fu&s;s about going to Law. Thou pretend'&s;t to
be even Mad, that thou art hinder'd from going
to Law; the Law is not open to thee; thou ha&s;t
not the freedom of the Law. But, <HI>Quaere pere|grinum
vicinia rauca reclamat.</HI> For do not we all
know that thou art up to the Ears in Law; that
thou ha&s;t been up to the Ears in Law the&s;e twenty
Years; and wilt be up to the Ears in Law, if thou
&s;hould&s;t live the&s;e hundred Years? Can we for|bear
laughing then, to hear thee cry out, that
thou &s;hould&s;t be the happie&s;t Man in the World,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
if thou could&s;t but go to Law? Ah, my dear
Friend, I could name &s;ome certain Per&s;ons, who if
they were no more re&s;train'd from going to Law
than thou art, would be happy indeed. But
what is it that hinders thee from going to Law?
The Gate of Madam Ju&s;tice, like that of Hell,
is open at all Hours. Free ingre&s;s is denyed to
none that have but Money to pay their Entrance;
Egre&s;s, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is not altogether To ea&s;ie.
What is it then that thou pretende&s;t &s;hould re|&s;train
thee from going to Law? Ha&s;t thou not
Money to pay thy Lawyers? Or art thou &s;uing
&s;ome unaccountable Debtors, who having Mo|ney
to &s;pare for their Liberalities and their Profu|&s;ions,
have that irregular greatne&s;s of Soul, that
they &s;corn to pay a ju&s;t Debt till it comes to Ex|ecution;
and who in&s;tead of di&s;charging, or &s;o
much as owning the Obligation they have to
thee, pretend to keep thee at Arms length, and
bid thee open Defiance? Should that be the Ca&s;e,
I believe I can give thee whol&s;ome Advice.
Know then, that there is a certain notable Ser|jeant
at Law, with a hard Name, who, if thou
repaire&s;t to him, will in&s;truct thee in an admira|ble
Method of dealing with &s;uch Per&s;ons. But
at the &s;ame time I cannot help acquainting my
dear Friend, that he ought to be a&s;ham'd to
have the word Law in his Mouth, as long as he
pretends to undo an Act of the Legi&s;lature, by
an Act of the Executive Power.</P>
<P>We are come now from Law, by a Whirl of
Imagination, to Conjurers and Hoop Petticoats.
But why will you go abroad for Intelligence,
which you may have at home; or go for Coun|&s;el
to the Deputy, when you may be advis'd by
the Principal? For does not every Mortal who
reads your Papers, &s;ay, the Devil in Hell is in
<PB N="7" REF="16">
you? Be&s;ides, how come you &s;o earne&s;t to get
a Patent for the Hoop, which you were &s;o
eager to demoli&s;h in your wonderful Specula|tions?</P>
<P>But, my dear Friend, thou ha&s;t been pleas'd
in this thy eleventh Paper, to return the Title of
Pedant, by which I &s;aluted thee in one of my
former, according to thy u&s;ual Method of giv|ing
what is thy own, to tho&s;e who do not in
the lea&s;t de&s;erve it. Tho' I plainly perceive that
thou art not quite &s;o proud of this Title, as thou
art of that of <HI>Knight;</HI> yet to &s;hew thee that I
&s;aluted thee with proper Greeting, I &s;hall en|deavour
to prove, that however di&s;agreeable
the Sound of Pedant may be to thee, thou art
certainly the Thing; and in order to this, will
endeavour to &s;hew thee what a Pedant, and
Pedantry are, of which in thy Lucubrations and
Speculations thou ha&s;t &s;o often treated
<Q><L>In proper terms, &s;uch as Men &s;matter,</L>
<L>When they throw out and mi&s;s the matter.</L>
<BIBL>Hud.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Pedant then is, literally and originally
&s;peaking, he who has the In&s;truction of Boys;
and the Pedant in the figurative Appellation,
which is now come to be the common one, is
he who in his Conver&s;ations with Men, or in
his Writings to Men, &s;hews the qualities of an
In&s;tructor of Boys. Now Boys not being come
to the u&s;e of their Judgment, nor the force of
their Imagination, are chiefly in&s;tructed by Me|mory.
Their In&s;tructors therefore never argue
with them, but only dictate to them, and make
u&s;e of Authority in&s;tead of Rea&s;on with them.
And to exert their Authority the more, and to
<PB N="8" REF="17">
cau&s;e it to make the &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion, they
dictate with a haughty and imperious Air, which
&s;ometimes is augmented to &s;uch a Degree, by
Weakne&s;s, Ill-Breeding, Pride and Choler, that
it becomes in&s;upportable, even to their deare&s;t
Friends and Relations. And if their Pupils are
backward in receiving their In&s;tructions, or give
them the &s;lighte&s;t Provocation, they treat them
with all tho&s;e Flowers of Rhetorick, with which
tho&s;e Per&s;ons are always in&s;pir'd, who frequent
the &s;onorous Nymphs of the Floud, that haunt the
Banks of the vocal <HI>Thames</HI> between the <HI>Bridge</HI>
and the <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have I &s;hewn, that the Pedant, in the
Acceptation in which the Word is commonly
us'd, has the &s;ame qualities with an In&s;tructor
of Boys; the chief of which qualities are a dog|matizing
Spirit, a pre&s;umptuous Arrogance, and
a &s;oaring In&s;olence.</P>
<P>Now the Man of Sen&s;e, and the Gentleman,
being diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Pedant, mu&s;t
be one, who in his Conver&s;ations and in his Wri|tings,
has the qualities of one who conver&s;es
with or writes to Men. Now he who knows
the World, and conver&s;es with, or writes to
Men, always Argues, and never Dictates; as
well knowing, that rea&s;onable Creatures are to
be convinced by Rea&s;on, and not by Authority.
And as Rea&s;on and Truth are calm and mode&s;t
things, he never a&s;&s;umes the Dictatorian Air, is
never Haughty, never In&s;olent.</P>
<P>But if at any time, he barely a&s;&s;erts, he does
it with Mode&s;ty, if not with Diffidence; as very
well knowing, that, tho' a Man by an in&s;olent
deci&s;ive Air, may pa&s;s upon tho&s;e who are go|vern'd
<PB N="9" REF="18">
by Fancy or Opinion; it never fails to
render him &s;u&s;pected to tho&s;e who are re&s;olv'd
never to &s;ubmit to any Opinion till they be con|vinced
by Rea&s;on; which latter &s;ort only may
be truly &s;aid to be Men. He therefore treats
his Companion or Reader with re&s;pect, and
would look upon it as a &s;candalous Indignity,
the breaking out into tho&s;e Tropes and Figures
which are &s;o much in u&s;e, with tho&s;e who con|ver&s;e
with, or who write to Boys, of what Age,
or Rank, or Condition what&s;oever tho&s;e Boys
are; whether they are in Infancy, or Youth, or
Virility, or Gravity or Decrepitude; whether they
are Ignorant or Learned Boys, of the Lees of the
People, or of Eque&s;trian Dignity.</P>
<P>And now by applying all this to my very wor|thy
Friend, I make no doubt but to make it ap|pear,
not only that thou ha&s;t the Spirit of Pedan|try
in thee, equal to any of thy Contemporaries
or Predece&s;&s;ours; but that thou ha&s;t by Nature
and Genius, what they have acquir'd by Indu|&s;try
and hard Labour; (for thou art certainly an
illiterate Pedant) and art the very Cock Pedant
of all the Ne&s;t of Pedants. For be&s;ides, that in
all thy Writings, whether Papers or Pamphlets,
whether <HI>Lucubrations, Speculations, Guardian, Lo|ver</HI>
or <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> I hardly ever knew thee argue
once; thou ha&s;t carried Authority to a more ri|diculous
Height, than ever Pedant before thee
did. For if the re&s;t of thy Brethren have had
the Extravagance, and the Pre&s;umption, to bear
down Human Rea&s;on, by downright Human Au|thority,
they have &s;till had &s;o much &s;hadow of
Mode&s;ty left, as to attempt it by the Authority

found nothing in that Paper of the Qualities of
the other, but only thy eternal Dogmatizing,
and the haughty and pedantick Air of a School|ma&s;ter.

<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Excellent FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Come now to con&s;ider thy
twelfth Paper, in which thou
pretend&s;t to Draw Pictures;
for which thou art ju&s;t as much
Qualifyed as thou art to Cri|ticize;
for to draw Characters,
and to Criticize, requires the
&s;ame Talent, that is, Judg|ment,
which God and Nature have never vouch|&s;afed
to endow thee with. And therefore, all
who know thee an errant Bungler, that is, all who
do know thee, are very well &s;atisfyed, that they
are no more to expect any more Re&s;emblance
in thy Draughts, than from a Sign Po&s;t Painter,
nay, not the twentieth part &s;o much. For no Sign
Po&s;t Painter was ever yet &s;uch a Blockhead, as
to Draw the Picture of a <HI>Rat,</HI> when he de&s;ign'd
that of an <HI>Elephant;</HI> or to Draw the Figure of
an <HI>Elephant,</HI> when he de&s;ign'd that of a <HI>Rat.</HI> But
now to whom is it not known, that thou ha&s;t gi|ven
us the Picture, of a <HI>Wren,</HI> in&s;tead of that of
<PB N="16" REF="24">
an <HI>Eagle;</HI> and the Picture of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> in&s;tead of
that of a <HI>Wren.</HI> And after thou ha&s;t call'd thy
dead Friend <HI>Wren,</HI> and thy &s;elf <HI>Eagle,</HI> does not
every Body know, that thou ha&s;t not the know|ledge
of <HI>Adam</HI> in thee, nor art qualified to give
Names to Creatures agreeable to their Natures?
But as thou art able to draw no body, no body
can have any occa&s;ion to draw thee. Thy
Name alone is thy Picture, and comprehends as
&s;evere and as entire a Satire in it as <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;ays
that of the <HI>A&s;s</HI> does.</P>
<Q><L>Dont le nom &s;eul en &s;oy comprend une Satire.</L></Q>
<P>Thou can&s;t draw no Picture, but it wants a
Name to di&s;tingui&s;h it; no one who names thee
has occa&s;ion to draw any Picture of thee.</P>
<P>What! art not thou the famous Di&s;tingui&s;her,
the celebrated Knower of the World, and of Me|rit,
who art continually endeavouring to be&s;|patter
and expo&s;e Mini&s;ters of State, of admi|rable
Abilities; and who have done the mo&s;t im|portant
Services for their King, their Country,
and the whole Chri&s;tian World; and among
whom, I have convincing Rea&s;ons to believe,
there are &s;uch, who are as much thy Superiours
in &s;olid Learning, or in Polite Litterature; in
Wit, and graceful Court-like Behaviour, and the
fine Conver&s;ation of Gentlemen; as they are
above thee in Sagacity and Penetration, in the
profoundne&s;s of State Affairs, and the depths of
Politicks? Art thou, I &s;ay, the famous Di&s;tin|gui&s;her,
the celebrated Knower of the World,
and of Merit, who at the &s;ame time that thou
art vainly and impertinently endeavouring to ex|po&s;e
and ridicule the&s;e Illu&s;trious Patriots, art
mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly attempting to make two or
<PB N="17" REF="25">
three paultry Players, pa&s;s upon the World
for Men of Manly, Generous, Elegant, Or|namental
Qualities? After this need any one
care whom 'tis thou Cen&s;ure&s;t, and whom 'tis
thou Commende&s;t? And yet to make thy Judg|ment
manife&s;t &s;till further, at the &s;ame time
that thou art endeavouring to expo&s;e tho&s;e whom
the King mo&s;t confides in, and whom he mo&s;t
values; thou art at every turn printing thy. in&s;i|pid
Madrigals in the Prai&s;e of His Maje&s;ty;
and &s;till the Burthen of thy Song is the &s;ame with
that of an old <HI>Starling,</HI> who is moulting his bor|row'd
Plumes in a Cage, Dick <HI>is a Bird for the
King!</HI> Dick <HI>is a Bird for the King!</HI> But how
much preferable to thine is the Song of the <HI>Star|ling?</HI>
Tho it does not mean what it &s;ays, like
thee; yet it does not like thee, mean &s;omething
contrary to it. The Bird it&s;elf is not &s;uch a Bea&s;t
as not to know, that a Libel upon all a Man's
be&s;t Friends, can never be interpreted a Pane|gyrick
upon the Man. Thus we &s;ee, that thou
never Cen&s;ure&s;t, and never Commende&s;t by
Rea&s;on and by Judgment, becau&s;e Rea&s;on and
Judgment are things which thou never had&s;t.
But thy Di&s;like, or Approbation, proceeds per|petually
from thy Pa&s;&s;ions, thy Malice, and thy
Intere&s;t; but e&s;pecially from the la&s;t, which is
thy great <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to an Error of thy Under&s;tand|ing,
about which I &s;hall u&s;e the more Words,
becau&s;e thou &s;ay&s;t thou ha&s;t &s;o often repeated it;
and that is, <HI>'tis generally for want of Judgment,
that Men &s;et up for the Character of being Judicious.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot for my Soul forbear talk|ing
to thee in the Language of thy Brother of
<HI>Brentford; Thou art mighty Ignorant poor Man, my
dear Friend is very Silly, I gad he is.</HI> For to what
<PB N="18" REF="26">
purpo&s;e can this jingle of Words &s;erve, but to
rattle in the Noddle of a <HI>wrong-headed</HI> Fellow?
For was there ever any Mortal who was not rec|kon'd
a Bea&s;t and an Idiot by his own, Acquain|tance,
but who &s;et up for the Character of being
Judicious in the Profe&s;&s;ion which he had embra|ced?
Does not a <HI>Shoe-maker,</HI> a <HI>Taylor,</HI> a <HI>Ho&s;ier,</HI>
&s;et up for the Character of being Judicious in the
nature and fa&s;hion and make of Shoes and Stoc|kings,
and Coats and Breeches and Cloaks?
Does not a <HI>Mercer</HI> &s;et up for the Character of
being Judicious, in the nature, and fa&s;hion of
Stuffs and Silks, and Brocades? Does not a <HI>Stock|Jobber,</HI>
or an <HI>Exchange Broker</HI> &s;et up for the Cha|racter
of being Judicious, in the Turns, the Ri&s;e
and Fall of the Publick Funds? When ten or
more <HI>Clergy-men</HI> Preach for a vacant Benefice,
does not each of them pretend to be more skil|ful
and Judicious in the ways of Salvation, than
his other Antagoni&s;ts? Would&s;t thou Fee a Law|yer
in an important Cau&s;e, who &s;hould tell thee
&s;eriou&s;ly, that he did not &s;et up for having more
Judgment than his Neighbours in Statute and
Common Law? Would&s;t thou tru&s;t thy Life up|on
a dangerous Cri&s;is, in the Hands of a Phy&s;i|cian,
who &s;hould a&s;&s;ure thee, that he had no
more Judgment in Phy&s;ick than one of his Pa|tients?
But to come to Authors, does not every
one who publi&s;hes a Book in any Art or Science,
pretend to in&s;truct at lea&s;t &s;ome of his Readers?
But which of his Readers can he pretend to In|&s;truct,
but tho&s;e who are more Ignorant than
him&s;elf in the matters of which he treats? But
if he &s;uppo&s;es that &s;ome of his Readers are more
Ignorant than him&s;elf in the matters of which
he treats, does not he &s;et up for the Character
of being more Judicious in tho&s;e matters than
they are?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27">
When <HI>Copernicus</HI> publi&s;h'd his Sy&s;tem of the
World, did not he pretend to a little more Judg|ment
in <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> than &s;ome who had gone be|fore
him, and others who liv'd at the &s;ame time
with him, and who &s;till adher'd to the <HI>Piolemaick</HI>
Sy&s;tem? When <HI>Des Cartes</HI> publi&s;h'd his Sy&s;tem of
Natural Philo&s;ophy, did not he by tho&s;e won|derful
Di&s;coveries of the motion of the Earth,
and others, pretend to a little more Judg|ment
in that Science, and to penetrate fur|ther
into the Secrets of Nature than tho&s;e who
had gone before him? When the Celebrated
<HI>Harvey</HI> gave the World his Treati&s;e of the Circu|lation
of the Blood, could he have oblig'd and
adorn'd the Common-wealth of Learning by that
noble and u&s;eful Di&s;covery, if he had not &s;et up
for the Character of having more Judgment in
<HI>Anatomy,</HI> than either his Predece&s;&s;ours, or his
Contemporaries? And when Sir <HI>I&s;ac Newton,</HI>
who&s;e Merit is above what the Mu&s;es them&s;elves
can Commend, oblig'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd the Learn|ed
World by his Immortal and unparallel'd Trea|ti&s;es;
tho&s;e Treati&s;es which have made him an
Honour to his Country, An Advancer of the no|ble&s;t
Learning, and an Enlarger of the Empire
of the Mind; what, did he pretend to no more
Judgment in <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> than the herd of Ma|thematicians?,</P>
<P>Is it not now mo&s;t apparent, that every one
&s;ets up for the Character of being Judicious in
his own Profe&s;&s;ion, and his own Art? Why then
&s;hould not that be allow'd to a Poet, which is
granted to all the re&s;t? And why &s;hould it be
denyed by thee of all Men; and be denyed in
a Paper, in which you are doing the very &s;ame
thing which you pretend to ridicule in others?
<PB N="20" REF="28">
For are not you pretending to write a Paper
here for the Improvement of-the Stage? And
how doe&s;t thou pretend to Improve it, by en|deavouring

&s;peaking the Truth, and telling the World that
thou art a very Silly Fellow, and an eternal

which are under the &s;ame Elevation of Pole;
Maxims which &s;hew'd thee as blind as <HI>Hector,</HI> or

<P>But the mi&s;chief of it is, that there is this dif|ference
between a four Leg'd Puppy, and a two

but for nine Days, a two Leg'd one does not only
come into the World Blind, but for the mo&s;t part
continues to be Blind, when he comes to be an
old Dog.</P>
<P>To this ble&s;&s;ed Maxim, thou art pleas'd to
&s;ubjoyn the&s;e Words, <HI>Every body of any &s;tanding in
<PB N="21" REF="29">
Town, knows that the dulle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tupid Writers
we have had, have &s;et up for Criticks;</HI> why yes
truly, this has been the Cant for forty Years, to|gether,
among Per&s;ons of thy noble Under|&s;tanding.
The Cry has gone round, that 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for any one who has &s;hewn him&s;elf a
Critick by his Pro&s;e, to &s;hew him&s;elf a good
Poet by his Ver&s;e; which was occa&s;ion'd fir&s;t,
by the late Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s publi&s;hing a very dull
Tragedy of <HI>Edgar,</HI> after he had publi&s;h'd a Book
in Pro&s;e, in which there was a great deal of good
and ju&s;t Critici&s;m. 'Tis true indeed, <HI>Edgar</HI> was
&s;o ab&s;urd a Monarch, that he &s;eem'd to be a fore|running
Type of thy &s;elf, who wert to &s;trut up|on
the Stage in the, &s;ucceeding Century, under
the &s;ame Heroick Name. From this accident,
the Poeta&s;ters of the Age, who believ'd it their
Intere&s;t to fix a Brand upon Critici&s;m, immedi|ately
cryed out, and made all their Di&s;ciples re|peat
after them, that no Critick could be a Poet;
not con&s;idering that one of the greate&s;t of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and, one of the greate&s;t of the
<HI>French,</HI> were Criticks by Profe&s;&s;on, as well as
Poets; <HI>and &s;et up for the Character of being Judicious
in their own Art;</HI> nay, and had the Impudence
to appear publickly out of Humour with &s;ome
Popular Scriblers, who had had Succe&s;s. But
to return to Mr. <HI>Rymer;</HI> whether that Gentle|man's
ill Performance proceeded from his want
of Imagination, without which no Man can
make a Poet, let him have what Judgment he
will; or from his want of Exerci&s;e and Practice,
we &s;hould have been better able to determine,
if that Judicious Gentleman had writ more. If
Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Tragedy is an ill one, neither <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>'s
or <HI>Ben. John&s;on</HI>'s fir&s;t Damatick Poems were
Ma&s;ter-pieces; and neither <HI>Ben</HI> nor <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI>
they had left nothing behind them but the&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="30">
would have pa&s;s'd with Po&s;terity tor great Poets.
But whatever was the Rea&s;on of Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Mi&s;|carriage,
if the&s;e Authors had only infer'd from
it, that a Man may &s;ometimes have the Theory
of an Art, which yet he may not be fully qua|lifyed
to practice with Succe&s;s, nothing could
have been more ju&s;t. But for them to draw not
only a general Inference from a particular Fact,
but an Inference &s;o very ab&s;urd, as that a Man
cannot Practice an Art with Succe&s;s, for no o|ther
rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he has &s;hewn that he
Under&s;tands it, was Be&s;tial and Abominable.
I am afraid, my dear Friend, that it will be found
upon enquiry, that the very contrary of this is
an eternal Truth. He who Practices an Art with
Succe&s;s, which he does not under&s;tand, is mo&s;t
infallibly an ill Arti&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all his
Succe&s;s; and is indebted for that Succe&s;s, to the
gro&s;s Ignorance and Barbarity of tho&s;e whom he
has the Luck to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If ever that A&s;&s;ertion, that the dulle&s;t and
mo&s;t &s;tupid Writers which we have had, have
&s;et up for Criticks is prov'd it mu&s;t be by thy Ex|ample.
For as there is not one Author alive,
who has &s;et up for Critici&s;m &s;o much as thou
ha&s;t, there is not in all <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;o &s;tupid and
&s;o dull a Writer as thou art, when thou art left to
thy &s;elf.</P>
<P>To make good both the Branches of this A&s;|&s;ertion:
when old <HI>Bicker&s;taff</HI> publi&s;h'd his <HI>Tatlers,</HI>
did he &s;et up for a Critick, did he &s;et up for the
Character of being Judicious or not? Let us &s;ee
what he &s;ays him&s;elf in his Dedication to the late
Mr. <HI>Maynwaring.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31">
The general purpo&s;e of this Paper is to expo&s;e
the fal&s;e Arts of Life, and to pull off the Di&s;|gui&s;es
of Cunning, Vanity, and Affectation; and
to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dre&s;s,
our Di&s;cour&s;e, and our Behaviour. No Man
has a better Judgment for the Di&s;covery, or a
nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Impo&s;ture,
than your &s;elf; which Qualities render you the
mo&s;t proper Patron for the Author of the&s;e
E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>Thus far old <HI>Bicker&s;taff.</HI> Now this as I take
it, is &s;etting&punc; up for &s;omething more than the
Character of being barely Judicious; tis &s;etting
up for Sagacity, tis &s;etting up for Penetration,
which are the Accompli&s;hments, and the Per|fections
of Judgment. Now if it be true, that
'tis generally for want of Judgment, that a Man
&s;ets up for the Character of being Judicious;
what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Man who &s;ets up for
the Character of Sagacity, for the Character of
Penetration? For &s;uch a one arrogates a hun|dred
times more to him&s;elf, than one who &s;ets up
for the Character of being barely Judicious in
pa&s;&s;ing his Judgment on the Works of Authors.
To know the Hearts of Men requires infinitely
more Capacity, than barely to know Books. A
Book alas, has but one meaning; whatever it
&s;peaks it thinks. But the Heart of Man has Folds
and Doubles, and Rece&s;&s;es innumerable. Yet
thro' all the&s;e ha&s;t thou pretended to pierce, and
con&s;equently ha&s;t pretended to Critici&s;m, of a
nobler and more difficult Nature, than any Au|thor
living. But though thou did&s;t pretend to do
all this, what thou really did&s;t of it was by the
Sagacity and Penetration of others. And when
thou had&s;t got ingenious Tools to write thee into

<P>The Court&s;hip which Sir <HI>Martin Mar-all</HI> made
to Mrs. <HI>Mille&s;ant,</HI> and that which thou did&s;t
formerly make to Dame <HI>Fortune,</HI> and to Madam
<HI>Fame,</HI> will certainly make a Parallel that will
run upon all Four. Sir <HI>Martin</HI> had a mind to
Mrs. <HI>Mille&s;ant,</HI> but not having Capacity, nor Ad|dre&s;s
to gain her, he prevail'd upon <HI>Warner</HI> to do
that for him, but to do it in &s;uch a way that Sir
<HI>Martin</HI> was to have the Credit and the Benefit of
it. Now the Lady being a Lover of Mu&s;ick,
Sir <HI>Martin</HI> was to give her a Le&s;&s;on upon the
<HI>Theorbo,</HI> and a Song. In order to this Sir <HI>Martin</HI> is
to appear in a Balcony, at a di&s;tance from her,
with a Lute in his Hand, and the Motions of a
Thrummer, and the Grimaces of a Singer, while
<HI>Warner</HI> is to Sing and to Play for him behind the
Curtain. Well! All this was very well concer|ted;
but the Succe&s;s of all was to depend upon
the Signal agreed upon between them, and that
was, that Sir <HI>Martin</HI> &s;hould leave off his Grima|ces,
and his Thrummings upon his dumb Lute, up|on
the Ringing of a Bell. But the fooli&s;h Knight
was &s;o full of his Mi&s;tre&s;s and him&s;elf, that tho'
the Bell rung twice, yet his Hand and Jaws &s;till
went, and expos'd him to the Scorn of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s
and the Chambermaid.</P>
<P>I will leave thee, my dear Friend, to apply all
this to thy &s;elf. But I cannot forbear taking no|tice,
that it was very imprudent in thee not to
leave off upon the Bells ringing twice; that is,
upon the Bell that rung for Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s,
and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Funeral.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="33">
I come now to &s;ome of the pretended Facts of
which thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed to accu&s;e me; and
I will begin with that which relates to Mr. <HI>Con|greve</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> upon whom thou &s;ay&s;t I
have been more &s;evere than upon any other Per|&s;ons.
As for being &s;evere upon Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI>
tis a figure in Speech, which <HI>Jeremy</HI> &s;ays in <HI>Love
for Love,</HI> interlards the greate&s;t part of his Con|ver&s;ation.
As for Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
I did write the <HI>Remarks upon Cato;</HI> but I did not
ba&s;ely flatter and &s;awn upon Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> while
he was living, and then more ba&s;ely in&s;ult him
as &s;oon as he was Dead. I did not while he was
living, write a flattering ful&s;om Dedication to
him, in which I made him a Thou&s;and times
greater than my &s;elf; and then as &s;oon as he was
Dead write a flattering ful&s;om Dedication to my
&s;elf, in which I made my &s;elf a Thou&s;and times
greater than him. A little below there is ano|ther
extraordinary Figure, where thou pretend&s;t
to in&s;inuate that I have been us'd by &s;ome Peo|ple
&s;o as a Man of Honour ought not to be us'd.
Who are tho&s;e People? Thou can&s;t not, thou
dare&s;t not name them. Becau&s;e then the Lye
would appear too gro&s;s and palpable. I'll tell
thee whom I have us'd at that rate, and that is,
thy Friend, thy Prie&s;t, thy Wor&s;hipper, thy
Viceroy. Thou either knowe&s;t or oughte&s;t to
know that I have beat him; and I do not know
but I might have been provok'd to do as much
by his Wooden God, if he had dar'd to offer to
my Face, what he has ba&s;ely writ. Thou &s;ay&s;t
that my Pamphlet is &s;o cruel, that it could be
writ by none but a Coward. I believe I have gi|ven
other &s;ort of Proofs of my Courage, than
one who in the time of a Bloody War, for twen|ty
Years together, took the King's Pay as a Sol|dier
<PB N="26" REF="34">
and never was in any Action; than one
who for twenty Years together fought as he writ,
by Proxy. The Cruelty of a Coward con&s;i&s;ts not
in Words but Actions: Then, then, was the
Cruelty, then was the Cowardice, when upon a
certain Night in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, three villanous
Foot-Pads rob'd a poor defencele&s;s Pa&s;&s;enger of
all that he had, and &s;aid that they did it by a
Deputation from thee. And thou wert afterwards
pleas'd to abet this Action, and call tho&s;e Foot-Pads,
Men of Manly, Elegant, Generous, Or|namental
Qualities. <HI>Hinc illae Lachrymoe.</HI> From
hence aro&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Crocodile</HI> Tears, which thou
ha&s;t &s;hew'd in &s;ome of thy Papers.</P>
<P>Did&s;t thou not &s;new thy Courage in a notable
manner, by giving &s;uch Language in thy <HI>Thea|tres,</HI>
after having declar'd again&s;t &s;ingle Combat
by thy Lucubrations, and again&s;t Siege and Bat|tle
by thy Conduct? Was it not Bravely and He|roically
done to call upon both the Living and the
Dead to revenge thy Cau&s;e upon one of Sixty
Five; and to endeavour to &s;et both the <HI>King</HI>'s
Hor&s;e and Foot Guards upon one of Sixty Five?
For my part, I have always firmly believ'd, that
I have more true Courage than any one, than
whom I have more Under&s;tanding. For if For|titude
is a Virtue, of which I know no Man who
doubts, it mu&s;t depend upon the Rea&s;on and not
upon the Complexion; but if it depends upon
the Rea&s;on, then the &s;tronger the Rea&s;on is, the
&s;tronger mu&s;t be the Virtue. And I have always
thought, that as God and Nature have given to
Man the Dominion over Bea&s;t, they have &s;o far
given to rea&s;onable Men the Dominion over
Blockheads, that they are rather born to &s;corn
them than to fear them. And I appeal to all my
Acquaintance in Town, of whom there are &s;e|veral
<PB N="27" REF="35">
living of 30 and 40 Years &s;tanding, if the&s;e
Sentiments were ever contradicted by any Action
or Accident of my Life.</P>
<P>But if by the continual Fears thou ha&s;t given
me, thou mean&s;t, as thou &s;eem&s;t to in&s;inuate, my
apprehen&s;ions of Per&s;ons to whom I may owe
Money; thou of all Men ha&s;t as little rea&s;on to
upbraid me with the&s;e Fears as the others. For
who was it that lay skulking &s;o many Years, at the
<HI>Tilt-yard Sutlers,</HI> when he was &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with Fear, that he could not think him&s;elf in
&s;afety, unle&s;s he had the Hor&s;e and Foot-Guards
for his Security? When the late facetious <HI>Daniel
Purcel</HI> gave him the name of Major General
<HI>Hide;</HI> and the chief Maxim of his Life &s;eem'd to
be, <HI>Qui latuit bene vixit.</HI> If I had the Misfortune
to be an In&s;olvent Debtor, I &s;hould have this A|pology
to make for my &s;elf, that my In&s;olvency
would not be owing to any Extravagance or
want of taking Pains, but to the hard, not
to &s;ay the unju&s;t U&s;age which I have met with
in the World; and in great part to your Inju&s;tice
and Barbarity, and the Inju&s;tice and Barbarity
of tho&s;e who deriv'd their Power from you. The
being an In&s;olvent Debtor, is rather to be pitied
than condemn'd, when it has not been occa&s;ion'd
either by Profu&s;ene&s;s or Idlene&s;s, but tho being
in Debt is both odious and contemptible in one,
who is at the &s;ame time a Squanderer, a Bank|rupt,
and an Oppre&s;&s;or. But yet to &s;hew you
that I am not in the condition which you ima|gine,
I have for the&s;e la&s;t four Years lodg'd con|tinually
in the Neighbourhood of <HI>White-hall,</HI> and
I appeal to the Honourable Board of Greencloth,
if during that time, &s;o much as one Complaint
as been preferr'd again&s;t me.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="36">
I &s;hould now &s;ay &s;omething of the Fal&s;hoods,

<HEAD>THE
PICTURE
OF
Sir John Edgar.</HEAD>
<P>_SIR <HI>John Edgar,</HI> the County of
&mdash;in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is of a middle Sta|ture,
broad Shoulders, thick Legs,
a Shape like the Picture of <HI>&s;omebody</HI>
over a Farmers Chimney, a &s;hort
Chin, a &s;hort No&s;e, a &s;hort Forehead, a broad
flat Face, and a dusky Countenance. He us'd
to compare him&s;elf to an <HI>Eagle;</HI> and to oblige
the fir&s;t Fool that he met with, to give it under
his Hand that he was &s;o. But neither his No&s;e,
nor his Eyes, nor his Di&s;cernment, nor his
broad flat Face, nor his dusky Countenance
were held to be Aquiline. He was believ'd to
be in all the&s;e more like to another Bird than an
<HI>Eagle.</HI> Yet with &s;uch a Shape, and &s;uch a Face,
he di&s;cover'd at Sixty that, he took him&s;elf for a
Beauty, and appear'd to be more mortify'd upon
his being told he was Ugly, than he was by any
reflection that was ever made upon his Honour
or his Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>He is a Gentleman born, Witne&s;s him&s;elf: of
a very Honourable Family, certainly of a very
Ancient one. For his Ance&s;tours flouri&s;h'd in
<HI>Tipperary</HI> long before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ever &s;et Foot in
<PB N="30" REF="38">
<HI>Ireland.</HI> He has Te&s;timony of this more Authen|tick
than the <HI>Heralds</HI> Office, or than any Human
Te&s;timony; for God has mark'd him more a|bundantly
than he did <HI>Cain,</HI> and &s;tamp'd his Na|tive
Country upon his Face, his Under&s;tanding,
his Writings, his Actions, his Pa&s;&s;ions, and above
all his Vanity. The <HI>Hibernian</HI> Brogue is &s;till up|on
all the&s;e, tho long Habitude and length of
Days have worn it from off his Tongue.</P>
<P>He is the greate&s;t Pretender but one, of the
Age in which he lives; a Pretender both to Un|der&s;tanding
and Virtue, but e&s;pecially to the lat|ter,
But &s;ome malicious People have thought, that
he made con&s;tant Court to that venerable Lady,
not out of any Affection which he had for her
Per&s;on, but becau&s;e he was &s;truck by the Charms
of the Joynture which he believ'd might follow
her. And they were confirm'd in this Opinion,
by ob&s;erving the Quarrels, which he had every
Day with one or other of her four Daughters.
Yet this pretended Pa&s;&s;ion did him great Service.
It was to him <HI>Major Domo, Factotum, Hou&s;ekeeper,
Cook, Butler, Taylor</HI> and <HI>Semp&s;tre&s;s;</HI> becau&s;e we
live in a noble Climate, where Per&s;ons who are
univer&s;ally known to be Cheats and Sharpers,
keep their Coaches by being &s;o.</P>
<P>Yet to one of the Daughters of that venerable
Lady, he paid great re&s;pect in Publick, <HI>vide|licet,</HI>
to Madam <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> And to gain her Favour,
and obtain her Protection, he thought it not be|neath
him, to admit the meane&s;t of her Servants
and Officers into the greate&s;t familiarity with
him. So that there was no re&s;pect of Per&s;ons a|mong
them. But it was <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Tom,</HI> and
<HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Hal,</HI> and <HI>Dick</HI> with them. But he al|ways
combin'd with the&s;e her Servants to injure
and abu&s;e her in Private, and unknown to her
play'd a hundred Pranks with them to the preju|dice
<PB N="31" REF="39">
of her Intere&s;t and Reputation; which were
not long kept &s;o very Private, but the World
took notice that neither he nor the Servants
car'd one Farthing for the Mi&s;tre&s;s they preten|ded
to &s;erve. He would very often do Extrava|gant
things, very &s;eldom Generous ones, and
never by his good will Ju&s;t ones. Yet was he a
great pretender to Genero&s;ity; but Genero&s;ity
with him was &s;quandring away his Money upon
Knaves and Fools who flatter'd him. Thus a
Bubble is a very generous Creature to the <HI>Shark</HI>
who preys upon him; and a Beggar is generous
to the Vermin that feed upon him.</P>
<P>He had that &s;eeming re&s;pect for the Laws of
his Country, and appear'd to be &s;o delighted
with them, that tho' he had the Happine&s;s of
enjoying them as much as the mo&s;t zealous of
his Fellow Subjects, even as tho&s;e to whom one
may &s;ay, the Zeal of the Law hath eaten them
up; yet that he might be &s;ure the Corre&s;pon|dence
between them might be for Life, he had,
thro' a greatne&s;s of Soul peculiar to him, a&s;&s;um'd
a noble Re&s;olution that would never &s;uffer him
to pay any one a Farthing, 'till it came to Exe|cution.
Yet notwith&s;tanding all this he was not
&s;atisfy'd; but was always crying out Law, Law,
more Law, more Law.</P>
<P>He appears to be mighty zealous for the Rights
of the People, and to be terribly afraid of the
return of the old Ari&s;tocracy, by which he has
got the nick Name with &s;ome of <HI>Ari&s;tocracy
Edgar.</HI> No Man had ever &s;o much in his Mouth,
Benevolence and Beneficence to Mankind, as he;
which to his Creditors &s;eems a great Fable: For,
&s;ay they, &s;ince he hates us who have mo&s;t oblig'd
him, to that degree, that he cannot endure to
&s;ee our Faces, how can he po&s;&s;ibly love the re&s;t?
He us'd one while to call him&s;elf the <HI>Chri&s;tian
<PB N="32" REF="40">
Heroe,</HI> till it grew a publick Je&s;t. For the Peo|ple
would not allow him to be a Heroe, becau&s;e,
tho he had been a Soldier &s;o many Years in the
time of a Bloody War, he never had been pre&s;ent
either at Siege or Battle; and he could not po&s;&s;i|bly,
they us'd to &s;ay, be a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e he
us'd con&s;tantly to &s;pend the Mornings in Cur&s;ing
<HI>the Hou&s;hold of Faith,</HI> tho' they came in &s;hoals to
his Levees, out of pure Zeal to exhort him to
do his Duty.</P>
<P>He valued him&s;elf exceedingly, upon being a
great Improver, and a great Reformer, tho' the
truth of the matter is, that he never had half Skill
enough to improve any thing, nor half Virtue
enough to reform any thing. During the time
that he was Governour of the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> the
Diver&s;ions of that place were more Stupid and
Barbarous than ever they were known to be be|fore,
and the wild Bea&s;ts more mi&s;chievous and
untractable. And he was e&s;pecially &s;o far from
Reforming any thing, that it was generally ob|&s;erv'd,
that the greater part of tho&s;e who had
been mo&s;t intimate with him, were very far from
being more Virtuous than their Neighbours;
tho' he never fail'd of doing one thing in order
to the making them &s;o, and that is, entring them
in the School of Adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now as for <HI>Temperance,</HI> another Daughter of
the abovementioned venerable Lady, he care&s;&s;es
and courts her all the live-long Day; and com|pliments
her as the Queen of Morals, and the
Empre&s;s of Life. But as &s;oon as the Night
approaches, then &s;parkling Champaign puts an
end to her Reign.</P>
<P>He judiciou&s;ly believes, that by preaching Ab|&s;tinence
up by Day-light, he has made an ho|nourable
Compo&s;ition for his drinking three
Bottles by Candle-light.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41">
We may &s;ay of his Fortitude, What <HI>Butler</HI> &s;aid
of <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Wit; He may be Ma&s;ter of a very
great deal, but thro' abundance of Mode&s;t'y is
&s;hie of making any Parade of it, but re&s;erves it
for an occa&s;ion which no body can diving. For
he has declar'd again&s;t &s;ingle Combat by his
Writings, and again&s;t Siege and Battle by his
Conduct and Actions, that is, by &s;taying at home
in a time of War, with a Commi&s;&s;ion in a Penny|le&s;s
Pocket, and choo&s;ing rather to run the Risk
of being taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than of
being kill'd by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for <HI>Prudence,</HI> the fourth Daughter, he
has a Magnanimity which teaches him utterly
to de&s;pi&s;e her, and to regard her as an abandon'd
Per&s;on, that pro&s;titutes her &s;elf to the lowe&s;t
Mechanicks. He therefore makes it the bu&s;ine&s;s
of his Life to Affront her, and abu&s;es her in all
his Conver&s;ation, his Writings and his Actions;
of which there can be ho &s;tronger Te&s;timony,
than his mortally di&s;obliging his cordial tho' par|tial
Friends who rais'd him, and going over to
a Party whom he had exa&s;perated beyond any
po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;incere Reconcilement.</P>
<P>He is &s;o great a Friend to Union, that al|mo&s;t
all Orders and Ranks of Men are united in
his Per&s;on. For he has been Poet, Orator, Sol|dier,
Officer, Projector, News-monger, Ca&s;ui&s;t,
Scribe, Politician, Fi&s;h monger, Knight&punc; and
Gold finder; and what is never enough to be ad|mir'd,
he has been all the&s;e, by virtue of other
Mens Capacities. Like a very Patentee, he has
perform'd the Functions of all the&s;e by Proxy,
and by Deputy. As an Author he Writ by Pro|xy;
as a Soldier by proxy he fought; He is &s;o
given to do every thing by Proxy and by De|puty,
that one would &s;wear he lies with his Mi|&s;tre&s;s
by Proxy and by Deputy, as &s;everal hone&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="42">
worthy Gentlemen of his Antiquity are us'd to
lie with theirs.</P>
<P>Tho no Man in <HI>Great Britain</HI> is &s;o fit a Subject
for Satire as him&s;elf, yet has he been always wri|ting
Waggi&s;h Lampoons upon others. And when|ever
he expo&s;es a Lord in one of his Libels, he
has got a trick of affronting him ten times more
by way of begging his Pardon.</P>
<P>He has been always begging &s;omething of the
Government; and tho he has obtain'd ten times
more of it than he de&s;erv'd, yet he grumbling
thinks they have given him nothing, becau&s;e he
has retain'd nothing; and is outragiou&s;ly angry
with &s;ome of the great Officers of the Crown, be|cau&s;e
they have refus'd to wa&s;t the whole time of
their Admini&s;tration in <HI>pouring Water into a Sieve.</HI></P>
<P>He had one while, as I hinted above, obtain'd
a Patent to be Governour of the, <HI>Bear-Garden;</HI> tho
that Patent was invalid and void, by vertue of a
previous Statute. Yet when he thought him&s;elf
e&s;tabli&s;h'd in that Po&s;t, he cho&s;e a <HI>Bear,</HI> a <HI>Baboon,</HI>
and a <HI>Wolf</HI> for his Deputy Governours; but part|ly
growing Lazy, and being partly convinc'd,
that the Deputies were fitter for Government than
the Principal, he abandon'd all to them; who con|ducting
them&s;elves by their Be&s;tial Appetites,
play'd &s;uch Pranks, that both Governours and
Deputies were all remov'd, and the <HI>Bear-Garden</HI>
turn'd into a <HI>Theatre.</HI> Which Conduct of his puts
me in mind of one <HI>Sempronius</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Knight,
who was made Director of the <HI>Ludi Fe&s;cennini,</HI> a
rough &s;ort of <HI>Bear-Garden</HI> Drama, in u&s;e among
the uncultivated <HI>Romans,</HI> before they were po|li&s;h'd
by the <HI>Grecian</HI> Arts; into which Employ|ment
he introduc'd three Wretches as his Depu|ties,
who were the utter ruin of that Diver&s;ion.
For the&s;s four Per&s;ons had not among them all
as much Judgment as a <HI>Ballad maker.</HI> And yet
<PB N="35" REF="43">
upon having this paultry Office conferr'd upon

Actions, all the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, all their
De&s;ires, and all their Inclinations, are the con|&s;tant
Subjects of his Satire.</P>
<Q><L>Quidquid agunt Homines, votum, timor, ira voluptas,</L>
<L>Gaudia, Di&s;cur&s;us, no&s;tri e&s;t farrago Libelli.</L></Q>
<P>Now will any one pretend that the private
Concerns of Life are not included in the&s;e
Ver&s;es?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s the celebrated <HI>French</HI> Satiri&s;t has
been a little more retentive; but yet they mu&s;t
know very little of him, who are to be told that he
&s;ometimes enters, into the private Concerns of
Life; which once more are the ju&s;t and adaequate
Subjects of Satire. But then the Satiri&s;t ought
to take care that the Cen&s;ures are always Ju&s;t,
and that either the Vices Satiriz'd are very Fla|grant,
and of pernicious Example, or the Per|&s;ons
egregious Hypocrites.</P>
