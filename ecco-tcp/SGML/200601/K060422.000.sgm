<P>THE following <HI>POEM</HI> came into my Hands by Accident, if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been &s;pread, may be call'd by &s;o &s;light a Term as Acci|dent. It is this Approbation which makes it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to make any Apology but to the Author: As he cannot but feel &s;ome Satisfaction in having pleas'd &s;o many Readers already, I flatter my&s;elf he will forgive my communicating that Plea&s;ure to many more.</P>

<L>THE <HI>Curfeu</HI> tolls the Knell of parting Day,</L>
<L>The lowing Herd winds &s;lowly o'er the Lea,</L>
<L>The Plow-man homeward plods his weary Way,</L>
<L>And leaves the World to Darkne&s;s, and to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fades the glimmering Land&s;cape on the Sight,</L>
<L>And all the Air a &s;olemn Stillne&s;s holds;</L>
<L>Save where the Beetle wheels his droning Flight,</L>
<L>And drow&s;y Tinklings lull the di&s;tant Folds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Save that from yonder Ivy-mantled Tow'r</L>
<L>The mopeing Owl does to the Moon complain</L>
<L>Of &s;uch, as wand'ring near her &s;acred Bow'r,</L>
<L>Mole&s;t her ancient &s;olitary Reign.</L>

<L>Beneath tho&s;e rugged Elms, that Yew-Tree's Shade,</L>

<L>The Swallow twitt'ring from the Straw-built Shed,</L>

<L>No more &s;hall wake them from their lowly Bed.</L>
</LG>

<L>For them no more the blazing Hearth &s;hall burn,</L>

<L>How bow'd the Woods beneath their &s;turdy Stroke!</L>
