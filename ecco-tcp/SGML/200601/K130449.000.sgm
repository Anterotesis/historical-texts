<P><HI>Jean Brown</HI> died in the 1719, and left three Sons, and one

keep hou&s;e by him&s;elf, married the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">titioner in the 1720&punc;
<PB N="2" REF="2">
with whom he got an annuity of 500 merks, payable out of
&s;ome hou&s;es in the <HI>Cowgate</HI> which &s;he had from&mdash;<HI>Gilchri&s;t</HI>
her former Hu&s;band. But &s;o far was &s;he from bringing the
money alledged with her, that her hou&s;hold-furniture was &s;old
to pay her debt, and was not &s;ufficient; neither could it be,
as her fir&s;t Hu&s;band was bankrupt, and his e&s;tate &s;oon after
brought to &s;ale before your Lord&s;hips, and purcha&s;ed by
Bailie <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> for payment of which he &s;old part of the
lands in <HI>Potterow</HI> which came by his fir&s;t wife. During the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of this marriage, Bailie <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> purchaled &s;ome
hou&s;es, and &s;old others, and carried on an exten&s;ive trade as
a Brewer and Di&s;tiller, which was managed by the Re&s;pon|dent
from 1721 to 1729; when the Petitioner wanting to
have the Re&s;pondent away from his Father's pre&s;ence, and
from any management in his bu&s;ine&s;s, prevailed on the Father
to take a Brewery for him; for which he promi&s;ed to give
him at the rate of 15 bolls of malt for all the years he had &s;erved
in his brewery; part of which he got, but not near to the
quantity promi&s;ed; which was all the &s;tock the Re&s;pondent
had from his Father, and was far from being &s;ufficient to en|able
him to carry on his trade.</P>
<P>But ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the 1732, the Bailie finding his own Brewery|affairs
going into di&s;order under the management of the Peti|tioner,
be &s;olicited the Re&s;pondent to come back again, and
take upon him the management thereof; which he did, un|der
the promi&s;e of ten pound <HI>per annum,</HI> to keep his pocket:
which he never got. So that the Petitioner is in the wrong
to &s;ay, that the Bailie's affairs were brought into di&s;order by
any advancements or cautionry for him. It is true he be|came
bound for <HI>Andrew,</HI> his &s;econd Son, at his &s;etting up a
cloth and &s;ilk &s;hop, to the extent of L. 200; which will fall
to be more particularly noticed afterwards: Ba&s;ides this, the
Bailie gave a portion with his Daughter when &s;he was mar|ried;
but the Re&s;pondent knows not what that was and he
<PB N="3" REF="3">
gave L. 20 to his third &s;on <HI>Adam,</HI> who was bred a Surgeon,
when he went abroad. This is all, &s;o far as the Re&s;pondent
knows, that the Bailie gave to his children of the fir&s;t mar|riage;
which was far from bringing his affairs into any di&s;|order;
for, after that he continued in very good circum&s;tances,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hou&s;es which yielded him L. 176 a-year of rent,
be&s;ides his exten&s;ive trade as Brewer and Di&s;tiller.</P>
<P>The Bailie finding him&s;elf growing old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1738.</NOTE> of this date,
thought it rea&s;onable, to make a Settlement of his e&s;tate a|mong
his children of the fir&s;t and &s;econd marriage; in which
he di&s;poned to the Re&s;pondent his hou&s;es in <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> and
<HI>Potterow,</HI> which yeilded L. 22 of rent; be&s;ides which, he
had formerly, at making the purcha&s;e of the Brewery in the
Gra&s;s-market, and &s;ome other hou&s;es in the Town, &s;ecured
the fee of them to the Re&s;pondent; which made the &s;hare
de&s;igned him by his Father to be about L. 80 a-year; but
this was burthened with the Petitioner's liferent to the extent
of L. 58: 5: 6. He likewi&s;e di&s;poned to <HI>Adam,</HI> his third
Son of the fir&s;t marriage, lands in the We&s;t-port to the ex|tent
of L. 13, and to <HI>John</HI> his elde&s;t Son of the &s;econd mar|riage,
he gave lands about the foot of <HI>Forre&s;ter</HI>'s wynd, and
about the Meal-market and Exchange, which yielded
L. 57: 15 s. of rent; and to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> his &s;econd Son of
the &s;econd marriage, he gave his lands in the <HI>Cannongate</HI> head,
which yeilded L. 12: 10 s. of rent; to <HI>Anne</HI> and <HI>E|lizabeth,</HI>
he gave the lands in <HI>Netherbow</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI> which
yeilded L. 20, 15 s. of rent; to <HI>Jean</HI> and <HI>Helen;</HI> he gave
&s;ome hou&s;es above Smith's Land: but as the&s;e were &s;old by
him&s;elf, he, by an after-deed, burthened his executors with
the payment of L. 100 to each of them; and to <HI>Janet,</HI> he
gave his hou&s;es in <HI>Niddrey</HI>'s wynd, which yielded L. 9, 5 s.
and as the Re&s;pondent's part was &s;o far affected with the Pe|titioner's
li&s;erent, the Bailie burthened <HI>John</HI> with the pay|ment
of 200 merks to him during the continuance of the
<PB N="4" REF="4">
liferent, and with a 100 merks to <HI>Andrew</HI> his &s;econd Son
during his life, to whom he gave no part of his heritance.</P>
<P>Here it will be proper to inform your Lord&s;hips of <HI>An|drew's</HI>
&s;ituation. It has been already ob&s;erved, that the Bai|lie
had become bound with his Son <HI>Andrew,</HI> at his &s;etting up
&s;hop, for L. 200 to <HI>Robert Pringle.</HI> Upon this &s;tock, <HI>Andrew</HI>
carried on bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome time, and dealt with <HI>Snee</HI> and
Company Merchants in London; but his &s;ales not being able
to an&s;wer his credit, and his Father refu&s;ing to become fur|ther
bound for him, his London Creditors refu&s;ed to give
him any more advances, and were threating diligence: to prevent
which, and to bring the Creditors into a compo&s;ition, it was a|greed
that he &s;hould make over, by a&s;&s;ignation, his whole
&s;hop goods, extending to near L. 300 to his Father, who,
about this time. had got right to the debt for which he had
become Cautioner. And the whole goods were put into his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, he was per&s;ua|ded,
by &s;ome very bad advice, to refu&s;e to give the &s;aid En|li&s;h
Creditors, who were the only other Creditors of <HI>Andrew,</HI>
any &s;hare thereof, tho' they were willing to have accepted ten
&s;hillings in the pound. And, for his further &s;ecurity, he ex|ecuted
a &s;ham-poinding of the&s;e goods already in his own
hands; which &s;o irritated the Creditors, that they indor&s;ed
their Bills to Mr <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who brought a proce&s;s again&s;t
the Bailie for payment of their debt, extending to L, 197: 9
: 11; in which the A&s;&s;ignation and Poinding were reduced.
But the Bailie dying before Decreet was pronounced, the pro|ce&s;s
was transferred again&s;t the Petitioner, and all the Chil|dren
of the Bailie of the fir&s;t and &s;econd marriage, and De|creet
was obtained again&s;t them all &s;or that &s;um. This cir|cum&s;tance,
and perhaps &s;ome reflections by <HI>Andrew</HI> that his
Father had not acted according to the agreement with him,
was the rea&s;on why the Bailie, in the Settlement of his af|fair's,
gave him nothing but the liferent-annuity of 100 merks.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
The Bailie, about this time, finding him&s;elf a dying exe|cuted
a Settlement of his moveables to the Petitioner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1743</NOTE> Mr.
<HI>Montgomery,</HI> now Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Cu&s;toms. <HI>William
Wardrobe, John Bell,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Chalmer,</HI> as Tru&s;tees for
his five daughters of the &s;econd marriage, who were autho|ri&s;ed
to turn all his moveables into money, to be &s;tock't out
on annual rent, and to be liferented by the Petitioner for the
aliment and education of her children; and in re&s;pect he had
&s;old the hou&s;es di&s;poned to <HI>Jean</HI> and <HI>Helen</HI> in the Settlement
1738, he ordained them to &s;ecure L. 100 Sterl to each of them,
be&s;ide their &s;hare of the re&s;idue, which they were to draw
with the re&s;t of their Si&s;ters, when the li&s;erent cea&s;ed; But
it is expre&s;sly provided, That, during the Petitioner's life and
continuing unmarried, &s;he was to have the &s;ole management of
the&s;e &s;ubjects, and the management of the other Tru&s;tees
was only to commence when any one of the&s;e events happen|ed:
&s;o that the Petitioner has no rea&s;on to complain that the&s;e
Tru&s;tees refu&s;ed to accept of the tru&s;t, &s;eeing, during her
life, they could have no power to act. In this deed, the
Tru&s;tees are appointed to &s;ell the hou&s;es in Cannongate-head,
which he by the deed 1738 had conveyed to <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who was
then dead, and to pay the price thereof to the Tru&s;tees for
the Creditors of Mr <HI>Mantgomery</HI> of <HI>Wrae,</HI> from whom he had
bought it at a judicial &s;ale.</P>
<P>Bailie <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> having thus &s;ettled his affairs, wherein he
did full ju&s;tice to the Petitioner and her children, died &s;oon
after in opulent circum&s;tances, as was reputed by all that
knew him, both in heritage and moveables, and not above
L. 500 of debt: and after his death, there was a meeting
of &s;ome friends for the Re&s;pondent with the Petitioner; at
which &s;he complained loudly of the Bailie's Settlements, and
alledged his affairs were in di&s;order, and that his effects
would not be able to an&s;wer his debts, and the other purpo|&s;e
therein de&s;igned: upon which an offer was made for the
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Re&s;pondent, that if &s;he would give up her right to the movea|bles,
&s;he &s;hould have &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for L. 500 to her&s;elf
and Children, and be freed of all her hu&s;band's debts. But
this &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and as &s;he had a right to the
moveables, &s;o &s;he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; and &s;he has ac|knowledged
that &s;he likewi&s;e kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and uplifted the
rents of all the hou&s;es belonging to her hu&s;band, except two
or three little hou&s;es which the Re&s;pondent uplifted the rents
of, which afforded him but a &s;crimp maintainence; and the
Petitioner, after keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her Hu&s;band's effects,
and carrying on the Brewing and Di&s;tilling as formerly, from
the month of April, when her Hu&s;band died, to the month
of December, &s;he at la&s;t confirmed her&s;elf executor, but took
care to give up as little in Inventary, as &s;he could with decency
do.</P>
<P>The Re&s;pondent being thus &s;tript of his Father's inheri|tance,
was about rai&s;ing a Proce&s;s for recovering his right,
when a Submi&s;&s;ion was propo&s;ed, which was readily gone into
by him and his Brother <HI>Andrew,</HI> who likewi&s;e thought him|&s;elf
injured, as they had not money to carry on proce&s;&s;es;
and their di&s;putes were accordingly &s;ubmitted to Me&s;&s;.
<HI>George Bo&s;wal</HI> and <HI>Andrew Dechar,</HI> who had &s;everal meetings
with the parties and their Doers; but in all their meetings,
e&s;pecially after the 1745, he perceived an evident partiality
in favours of the Petitioner, who got allowance of every
article claimed by her. But this Submi&s;&s;ion happening to
expire without any Decreet-arbitral being pronounced, the
Re&s;pondent was re&s;olved never to &s;ubmit his affair again to
the&s;e Arbiters, and brought a Proce&s;s again&s;t the Petitioner
before the Sheriff, to account for her intromi&s;&s;ions with her
Hu&s;band's effects, and for freeing him of his Father's mo|veable
debts.</P>
<P>The Petitioner, afraid of being brought to account, and
anxious to have the Submi&s;&s;ion renewed to the &s;ame Arbiters,
fell upon this &s;tratagem. She paid <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s debt, and
<PB N="7" REF="7">
took right to his Decreet and Diligence in the name of <HI>Wil|liam
Richarad&s;on</HI> her Tru&s;tee, which Decreet was again&s;t her
and all the Repre&s;entatives of Bailie <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> and which &s;he,
as &s;ole intromitter with his effects, was obliged to pay; and
upon this diligence a Caption was rai&s;ed, and the Re&s;pondent
was taken, and threatned with being put in pri&s;on, unle&s;s he
would renew the Submi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ame Arbiters; which he
al&s;olutely refu&s;ed; whereupon he was put in pri&s;on on the
14th July 1748, an his Brother <HI>Andrew,</HI> who was then in
a dying condition under a decay, came up in the afternoon
to &s;ee him, and he was likewi&s;e arre&s;ted; but no intreaties,
by his wife and her friends, repre&s;enting the danger he was in
of dying in pri&s;on, could prevail with Mr <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> the Pe|titioner's
Tru&s;tee, and <HI>John Walker,</HI> her Son-in-law and ordi|nary
Doer, to con&s;ent to his liberation, unle&s;s the Re&s;pondent
and his Brother would &s;ign a new Submi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e Arbi|ters:
So they pa&s;t that night in pri&s;on, in which <HI>Andrew</HI> had
almo&s;t died, which, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitations of
<HI>Andrew</HI>'s wife and her Cou&s;in Bailie <HI>Blackwood,</HI> and of <HI>George
Balfour, Andrew</HI>'s Doer, induced the Re&s;pondent next day to
&s;ign this extraordinary Submi&s;&s;ion; but at the &s;ame time he de|clared,
that he would rather have lain in pri&s;on till he rotted,
than have &s;igned the Submi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e Arbiters, had it not
been out of regard to his Brother, and &s;ave his life. And
here its to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e &s;olicitors were all the friends
of <HI>Andrew,</HI> and acting for him, but had no connection with
the Re&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Upon &s;igning of this Submi&s;&s;ion, they were &s;oon after &s;et
at liberty, and not the lea&s;t demand was made upon either of
them for payment of the debt upon which they were laid in
pri&s;on, nor of any corroborative &s;ecurity therefor. They had
obtained the &s;ole purpo&s;e for which they had execute the
Caption; but they took care, that <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> in who&s;e name
the Caption was, &s;hould noit be a party-&s;ubmitter; &s;o that
Diligence was &s;till kept as an aweband over their heads, in ca&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="8">
they &s;hould offer to quarrel the Submi&s;&s;ion on account of its
being extorted from them <HI>metu carceris,</HI> it being in their power
to put it in execution at any time.</P>
<P>Whether the Arbiters had any meetings afterwards before
the &s;igning of the Decreet-arbitral upon the 6th November
following, the Re&s;pondent knows not; but one thing he is
&s;ure of, that he never met with them after, nor did he ever
de&s;ire or impower his Doer <HI>William Garden</HI> to meet with
them, or to give in any papers or Memorials to them; and,
&s;o far as he knows, Mr <HI>Garden</HI> never met with any of them,
nor gave in any Memorials to them; for he had told him
that he was re&s;olved to quarrel the Submi&s;&s;ion whenever he
was in a capacity to do it.</P>
<P>The Decreet-arbitral was no &s;ooner put into the Regi&s;ter,
than a Charge was given to the Re&s;pondent to obtemper the
Decreet-arbitral; and upon his refu&s;ing, a Caption was taken
out, which obliged him to retire to the Abbey, and there he
was narrowly watched for &s;everal years with different Me&s;|&s;engers,
in ca&s;e he &s;hould happen at any time to come out of
the Sanctuary. As he was &s;tript of all his Father's inheri|tance,
and had nothing to live on but the charity of friends,
it was no wonder that he was not able to bring his quarrel of
this Submi&s;&s;ion and Decreet-arbitral &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The Petitioner having got the Decreet-arbitral ab&s;olutely
to her mind, &s;he, for her&s;elf and children, and her &s;on-in-law
<HI>John Walker,</HI> led Adjudications again&s;t the e&s;tate; which
obliged the other Creditors likewi&s;e to adjudge; and a proce&s;s
of Ranking and Sale was carried on in the name of <HI>Richard|&s;on</HI>
the Petitioner's Tru&s;tee, in which a &s;tate of the debts
was made out, where &s;he, her children, and <HI>John Walker</HI>
her &s;on-in-law craved to be ranked for no le&s;s a &s;um than
L. 1405: 3: 10 Sterling; which is more than the proven
value of the e&s;tate, and would have been tanked accordingly,
of the Re&s;pondent had not appeared, and oppo&s;ed the &s;ame;
and this over and above the Pettioner's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> with
<PB N="9" REF="9">
the whole moveables of her Hu&s;band, and the rents of his
e&s;tate for 9 years, when the Re&s;pondent, the father's elde&s;t
Son, and heir to his mother, who brought &s;o large a part of
this &s;ubject with her, is &s;tript of all.</P>
<P>The Re&s;pondent hopes he will be excu&s;ed in giving your
Lord&s;hips &s;o full a detail of pa&s;t tran&s;actions, which he thought
him&s;elf obliged to do, that your Lord&s;hips might have a ju&s;t
and true view of the matter. He &s;hall now proceed to con|&s;ider
the &s;everal arguments in&s;i&s;ted upon for altering the Lord
Ordinary's Interlocutor, twice adhered to by his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, That there is no legal evidence that the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
was &s;igned in pri&s;on. As to which, it is true, that
Mr <HI>Alexander Blackwood</HI> is the only per&s;on who depones to
the preci&s;e fact of the Submi&s;&s;ion being &s;igned in pri&s;on; but
as he was an in&s;trumentary witne&s;s to their &s;igning the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
there, and the only &s;urviving in&s;trumentary witne&s;s, it
is &s;ubmitted to your Lord&s;hips, whether his &s;ingle Depo&s;ition
is not a &s;ufficient proof of the fact, in which he could not be
mi&s;taken nor under any doubt, though he u&s;es the pre|caution,
which every witne&s;s is allowed to do, e&s;pecially when
deponing of facts which happened 12 years before, <Q>That,
to the be&s;t of his remembrance, he carried up a &s;crole
of the propo&s;ed Submi&s;&s;ion to the pri&s;oners, which they
revi&s;ed; and that they having agreed to the &s;crole, he
afterwards carried up the Submi&s;&s;ion extended upon &s;tamp
paper; and that, to the be&s;t of his remembrance, he received
both the &s;crole and principal Submi&s;&s;ion, either from Mr
<HI>Balfour,</HI> or from Mrs <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> the pri&s;oner's wife: and
that, to the be&s;t of his remembrance, he &s;aw both the &s;aid
<HI>James</HI> and <HI>Andrew Thom&s;on</HI>'s &s;ign the &s;aid principal Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
in the pri&s;on; to which, &s;o far as he can recollect,
he is a &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;s; and that the Deponent thinks
they were very &s;oon relea&s;ed after &s;igning the Submi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ays. <Q>That he remembers that both the &s;aid <HI>James</HI>
and <HI>Andrew Thom&s;ons</HI> &s;eemed aver&s;e to enter into the &s;aid
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Submi&s;&s;ion; and that <HI>James</HI> in particular &s;aid, he was
afraid it might hurt him with re&s;pect to &s;ome deeds execute
by his Father in favours of him the &s;aid <HI>James.</HI> He
&s;wears likewi&s;e to <HI>Andrew</HI>'s bad &s;tate of health, and that
his wife was anxious for his liberation, and told him that
their liberation was offered them upon condition of their
&s;igning a Submi&s;&s;ion; and that, at her de&s;ire, he went &s;eve|ral
times up to pri&s;on to per&s;wade him; and that <HI>George
Balfour, Andrew</HI>'s Doer, was with him at &s;ome of the&s;e
times.</Q> This, the Re&s;pondent apprehends, is as full and
&s;atisfying a proof as can be de&s;ired, and as could well be ex|pected,
when the other in&s;trumentary witne&s;s is dead. And
it is confirmed in every other circum&s;tance, except the &s;igning
of the Submi&s;&s;ion in pri&s;on, by <HI>Maney Blackwood,</HI> the widow
of <HI>Andrew Thom&s;on,</HI> who, as being more particularly concerned
in the affair than Bailie <HI>Blackwood,</HI> is more pointed and clear
as to &s;everal circum&s;tances attending that tran&s;action than he
can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time, and in an
affair where he had but an accidental concern. And if this
proof &s;hould not be thought &s;ufficient, the Re&s;pondent could
yet adduce two other witne&s;&s;es, <HI>Alexander Hender&s;on</HI> and <HI>James
Brown,</HI> who came up to them in pri&s;on, after their &s;igning
the Submi&s;&s;ion, and were employed by them to go and &s;eek
money to pay the pri&s;on-dues, in order to their getting out.</P>
<P>It is next &s;aid, That though the fact of &s;igning the Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
in pri&s;on was proven, yet it was not relevant to &s;et
a&s;ide the decreet-arbitral, which is indeavoured to be &s;upport|ed
at great length, and &s;everal ca&s;es are taken notice of con|cerning
tran&s;actions with debtors in pri&s;on for payment of ju&s;t
debts, or for granting additional &s;ecurities therefore. But the
Re&s;pondent apprehends, that the law is quite clear, by the
Civil law the edict of Praetor was the rule, <HI>Quod metus
cau&s;a ge&s;tum erit ratum non babebo.</HI> And in the 22d <HI>l. dig.
Quod metus cau&s;a in carcerem quem detru&s;it ut aliquid ei ex|torqueret,
quid ob banc cau&s;am &s;actum e&s;t, nultius momenti e&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
And Lord <HI>Stair, tit. Reparation, parag.</HI> 8. That, by the Prae|tor's
edict, and the cu&s;tom of this and other nations, &s;uch
deeds and obligations as are by force and fear, are made utter|ly
void; and he cites a deci&s;ion very parallel to the pre&s;ent
ca&s;e, 22d January 1667, <HI>Mair contra Stewart</HI> of <HI>Shambelly,</HI>
where <HI>metus</HI> was &s;u&s;tained to reduce a Bond granted by a par|ty
taken by Caption, becau&s;e he was &s;ick. The Re&s;pondent
apprehends, that there is no compul&s;itor in law to oblige a
per&s;on to enter into a Submi&s;&s;ion: That can only be brought
about by the free and voluntary con&s;ent of parties; and there|fore
the u&s;ing a diligence, which is allowed by law, for re|covering
payment of a debt, for this purpo&s;e, is a perverting
of the law; and the u&s;ing it &s;o again&s;t a per&s;on &s;ick and in
danger of dying, was a glaring and gro&s;s perverting of the
law, which the Petitioner is forced to own will afford a ground
for reducing the&s;e deeds as exported <HI>vi et metu carceris.</HI> The
Re&s;pondent might add, That as the Petitioner had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
her&s;elf of all her Hu&s;band's effects, and &s;he has acknowled|ged
that &s;he had paid that debt, no doubt, out of the
produce of her Hu&s;band's effects, as &s;he had no other funds,
he &s;ubmits it to your Lord&s;hips, how far &s;he could have u&s;ed
that diligence again&s;t the Re&s;pondent for re-payment of it to
her, as &s;he the executrix had already paid it out of the funds
of her Hu&s;band the original debtor; and if &s;he could not, then
all her argument ju&s;tifying the impri&s;onment of the Re&s;pon|dent
and his Brother, falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The Re&s;pondent apprehends, he needs not take up much
time in an&s;wering the &s;everal ca&s;es founded on by the petitioner
in &s;upport of her claim; for in the&s;e the intention of impri|&s;onment
was to get payment or &s;ecurity, and the debtor was
under an obligation to pay the debt, or to grant further &s;e|curity
for it, and if he either paid it in pri&s;on, of granted
new &s;ecurity for it, he did no more than the law obliged him
to do; and therefore the&s;e tran&s;actions may be held good in
law, though done in pri&s;on; and in the&s;e ca&s;es the debtor
gave a full con&s;ent to the tran&s;action; whereas here the Re|&s;pondent
<PB N="12" REF="12">
gave no con&s;ent to the thing, and &s;howed to demon|&s;tration
that he only did it to &s;ave his Brother's life, and pro|cure
per&s;onal liberty to both. But, at the &s;ame time, it is
certain, that if any iniquity was done to per&s;ons in pri&s;on by
the&s;e tran&s;actions, they would be reduced on this head, which
makes a very material difference between the&s;e ca&s;es and the
pre&s;ent one; for here, if the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion be &s;upported, the De|creet-arbitral
following thereon, how iniquous &s;oever, cannot
be reduced, iniquity not being one of the grounds of law for re|ducing
a Decreet-arbitral.</P>
<P>The Petitioner endeavours to ju&s;tify her in&s;i&s;ting on a Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
as a rea&s;onable action for &s;ettling the mutual claims,
which each party had on one another. But here it will be ob|&s;erved,
that the Petitioner had no claim upon the Re&s;pondent,
but to get him to confirm her illegal u&s;urpation of all her
Hu&s;band's e&s;tate. He indeed had a claim again&s;t her, to
re&s;tore to him what part of his Father's inheritance he had left
to him, and to free him of his Father's moveable debts, which
&s;he was obliged to do, as intromitter with his moveable effects.
But, from pa&s;t experience, he had found that he was in no
likelihood to obtain this before the former Arbiters; and
therefore, nothing but to &s;ave his Brother's life, could have
induced him to &s;ubmit his cau&s;e again to the&s;e Gentlemen.
However good their character may be otherwi&s;e, their decern|ing
&s;uch a &s;um to the Petitioner and her children, and, at the
&s;ame time, &s;tripping the Re&s;pondent is &s;ufficient to &s;how the
iniquity of their Decreet-arbitral. But he apprehends his
plea for reducing the Submi&s;&s;ion is good, upon the head of
fear and force.</P>
<P>The Petitioner &s;ays, That the Re&s;pondent did homologate
the Submi&s;&s;ion, when he was at liberty, by his Doer <HI>William
Garden,</HI> giving in Memorials and other papers to the Arbiters
upon the &s;ubject of the Submi&s;&s;ion. This has already been
taken notice of, and denied; and it is but very faintly alled|ged
by the Petitioner; for all &s;he can &s;ay on this head is, that
it appears from Mr. <HI>Garden's</HI> compt-book, where he &s;tates an
<PB N="13" REF="13">
article, in his accompt with the Re&s;pondent, for drawing a
Memorial to be given in to the&s;e Arbiters. How the Peti|tioner
got acce&s;s to Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s compt-books, is not known;
but from her &s;tating it, it does not appear, whether this Me|morial
was to be given in to the Arbiters, during the depen|dence
of the fir&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion, or of the &s;econd. Neither does
it appear whether ever that Memorial was given in to the
Arbiters: But, if it was given in to them, during the &s;econd
Subm&s;&s;ion, he po&s;itively denies that ever he gave Mr <HI>Gar|den</HI>
any warrant or commi&s;&s;ion to give in &s;uch Memorial.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, in &s;upport of his having homologate the Submi&s;|&s;ion,
that he made no challenge of it for &s;ome years, though
he was at his full liberty all the while. Your Lord&s;hips will
have ob&s;erved, from the narrative of the ca&s;e, that he was
far from being at liberty; the Petitioner had no le&s;s than two
Captions again&s;t him, one upon <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s debt, and the o|ther
upon the Decreet-arbitral, and the Me&s;&s;engers hired to
watch him, in ca&s;e he came out of the Abbey. It was, no
doubt, the Re&s;pondent's intere&s;t to have brought his quarrel
&s;ooner; but his want of liberty, and e&s;pecially his want of
money to carry on the proce&s;s, was the occa&s;ion of the delay;
and if he had not got your Lord&s;hips <HI>gratis</HI> warrant, he mu&s;t
have been &s;ilent &s;till; at the &s;ame time, he apprehends, it
would have been competent to him to have brought his action
any time within forty years.</P>
<P>It is an affected pretence in the Petitioner to &s;ay, that &s;he has
lo&s;t the vouchers of her accompts, which &s;he looked upon as
unnece&s;&s;ary to be kept for &s;o long a time, by which &s;he could
have &s;upported the Decreet-arbitral in every point; for your
Lord&s;hips will have ob&s;erved, that the Re&s;pondent, <HI>de recenti,</HI>
refu&s;ed to ratify and fulfil the Decreet-arbitral, and &s;aid he
would quarrel it whenever he had it in his power; whereupon,
&s;he took a Caption again&s;t him; and that being the ca&s;e, it is
not probable that &s;he has lo&s;t any one of her vouchers.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the rea&s;ons of reduction before the Lord Or|dinary,
&s;everal particular iniquities committed by the Arbiters,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
were mentioned, and many more could have been in&s;i&s;t|ed
on; but, as there Were Objections and An&s;wers lying before
his Lord&s;hip, to be advi&s;ed when the Decreet-arbitral &s;hould
be &s;et a&s;ide, there were only a few noticed, which the Peti|tioner
has endeavoured to take off, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary
for the Re&s;pondent to re&s;ume them, though he thinks his re|duction
well founded without them. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was, That
&s;he ought to have &s;hown diligence for &s;etting the hou&s;es, and
for recovering the rents and out&s;tanding debts, which the Ar|biters
had not found her liable to do; upon which it is now
&s;aid that iniquity in Arbiters is no ground for reducing their
Decreet-arbitral; and <HI>2dly,</HI> That it would have been impro|per
for an executor to wa&s;te the funds of the executry in do|ing
diligence for debts, where there was not the &s;malle&s;t pro|&s;pect
of recovery; but, at this rate, every executor might
have it in his power to do what &s;he plea&s;ed with the executry
without being liable to quarrel from any hand; whereas, It
is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule in law, That an executor mu&s;t make up
full inventaries in a cafe, where there is a competition of Clai|mants,
whether creditors or heirs, and is liable to do diligence
for making the executry effectual, and is obliged to find a
cautioner for that effect. No body, to be &s;ure, would in&s;i&s;t
that &s;he &s;hould lay out good money in &s;eeking in de&s;perate
debts; but &s;till it was incumbent upon her to &s;hew what of
the&s;e debts were de&s;perate, which &s;he was not ordained to do
by the Arbiters.</P>
<P>The Petitioner now has acknowledged, that &s;he has re|covered
of the executry to the amount of L. 700 Sterling,
and upwards; the Re&s;pondent believes &s;he has or might have
recovered a great deal mare as it was reputed to be above L. 1600.
But here a que&s;tion naturally occurs, What has &s;he done with
this great &s;um of executry intromitted with by her? The de|funct's
moveable debts ought naturally to have been paid out of
his executry. Has &s;he done that? it is believed &s;he will not an&s;wer
in the affirmative; the debts of her Hu&s;band were in and about
L. 500 Sterling; and it appears from the li&s;t of debts now in
<PB N="15" REF="15">
the Ranking, that they are all &s;till out&s;tanding, and not &s;o
much as the annualrent of any of them paid, though be|&s;ides
this executry intromitted with by her, &s;he had nine years
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;band's heritable e&s;tate of L. 164 <HI>per an|num,</HI>
except the two hou&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Re&s;pondent; not|with&s;tanding
whereof the Arbiters find her a Creditor on the
&s;ubject for L. 101: 19: 11&frac13; Sterling; and L. 95: 6: 6
Sterling.</P>
<P>It was noticed before the Lord Ordinary, that the Arbiters
had committed iniquity in finding the Petitioner intitled to
aliment for her children, which is now &s;aid to be highly ju&s;t,
as their provi&s;ions con&s;i&s;ted in certain heritable &s;ubjects, which
were liferented by their Mother, and that therefore they were
intitled to be alimented with their Father's effects till they came
to enjoy their own provi&s;ions. Here an obvious an&s;wer will
occur, The Father, by his deed in the 1738, di&s;poned to the
Petitioners children, hou&s;es which yielded upwards of L. 90
of rent; and as the Petitioner's two liferents, amounting to
1100 merks, or L. 61: 2: 2 &frac23; Sterling, was laid upon the
Re&s;pondent's part of the heritage to the extent of L. 58: 5: 6
Sterl. it is evident that very little of her children's provi&s;ions
&s;tood affected with their Mother's liferent: So that if &s;he had
managed matters a-right, there was a &s;ufficiency to have aliment|ed
her children out to their own provi&s;ions; and &s;he had be&s;ides
the re&s;idue of the executry over payment of the debts made over
to her by her hu&s;band. But tho' that had not been the ca&s;e,
a que&s;tion would have ari&s;en, in ca&s;e the e&s;tate be bankrupt,
as &s;he pretends, Whether the Creditors would be obliged to
maintain her Children or not, e&s;pecially when &s;he their Mo|ther
was peaceably enjoying two jointures extending to 1100
merks, free of all publick burdens? And another que&s;tion
would have occured, whether the Re&s;pondent, as matters
&s;tood by the deeds of his Father, would have been obliged
to aliment his Brothers and Si&s;ters, &s;uppo&s;ing the e&s;tate had
not been bankrupt?</P>
<P>Another article of complaint again&s;t the Decreet-arbitral
mentioned before the Ordinary was, That the expenses of
<PB N="16" REF="16">
repairs of the hou&s;es which &s;he had in liferent from her la&s;t
Hu&s;band were allowed her, through that was not provided
in the Contract of Marriage, to which it is now &s;aid that the
hu&s;band became bound that the hou&s;es &s;hould yield 600
merks free of all taxations and publick burdens. But repa|ration
of liferented hou&s;es, is a burden upon the li&s;erenter,
and is neither to be accounted a taxation or publick burden.</P>
<P>The Petitioner, in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> place, endeavours to make an
apology for the &s;malne&s;s of the rent accounted for by her for
the five years of her intromi&s;&s;ion preceeding the Decreet|arbitral,
when compared with the five years rents uplifted by
your Lord&s;hips Factor, when the e&s;tate was &s;eque&s;trate, and
&s;ays, that &s;undry of the hou&s;es were wa&s;te and in bad repair,
and that the &s;ums laid out by her in reparing them, made
them &s;et better afterwards. But here it is to be ob&s;erved,
that, after all her repairs, the highe&s;t rent &s;he brings up the
hou&s;es to in the la&s;t year of her intromi&s;&s;ion, is but L. 129
and &s;ome odd &s;hillings, whereas the Factor's rental is L. 164.</P>
<P>And, upon the whole, the Petitioner concludes, that there
is no good exception again&s;t the ju&s;tice of the Decreet-arbi|tral,
and that there is no relevant ground in law for reducing
this Submi&s;&s;ion, and that iniquity is no relevant ground for
reducing the Decreet-arbitral. The Re&s;pondent apprehends,
that he has much better ground to &s;ay, that the Decreet-arbi|tral
is in every particular iniquous, and that whether it was
iniquous or not, he is founded in law to reduce the Submi&s;&s;ion,
the &s;igning of which was elicit from him and his Brother
<HI>metu carceris;</HI> and that the petitioner, by her extraordinary,
illegal and unwarrantable management of her hu&s;band and
childrens affairs, has occa&s;ioned difficulties, and probably lo&s;s,
which may not be ea&s;ily recovered from her, and &s;he in the
mean time is quietly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 1100 merks free of public
burdens, tho' &s;he has only now two of her &s;ix children with
her, while the Re&s;pondent, the heir, has not a farthing of his
Father's effects to live upon, which he hopes will merit the
con&s;ideration of the Court.</P>
