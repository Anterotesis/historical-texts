<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM A Lady in <HI>ENGLAND</HI>; TO A GENTLEMAN at <HI>AVIGNON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO Thee, dear Rover, and thy vanqui&s;h'd Friends,</L>
<L>The Health, &s;he wants, thy gentle <HI>Chloe</HI> &s;ends:</L>
<L>Though much You &s;uffer, think I &s;uffer more,</L>
<L>Wor&s;e than an Exile on my Native Shore.</L>
<L>Companions in your Ma&s;ter's Flight you roame,</L>
<L>Unenvy'd by your haughty Foes at home;</L>
<L>For-ever near the Royal Outlaw's &s;ide</L>
<L>You &s;hare his Fortunes, and his Hopes divide,</L>
<L>On glorious Schemes, and Thoughts of Empire dwell,</L>
<L>And with Imaginary Titles &s;well.</L>

<L>Say (for thou know'&s;t I own his &s;acred Line,</L>
<L>The Pa&s;&s;ive Doctrine, and the Right Divine)</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3">
Say, what new Succours do's the Chief prepare?</L>
<L>The Strength of Armies? Or the Force of Pray'r?</L>
<L>Do's he from Heav'n or Earth his Hopes derive?</L>
<L>From Saints Departed? Or from Prie&s;ts Alive?</L>
<L>Nor Saints nor Prie&s;ts can <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI>'s Troops with&s;tand,</L>
<L>And Beads drop u&s;ele&s;s through the Zealot's Hand;</L>
<L>Heav'n to our Vows may Future Kingdoms owe,</L>
<L>But Skill and Courage win the Crowns below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E're to thy Cau&s;e, and Thee, my Heart inclin'd,</L>
<L>Or Love to Party had &s;educe'd my Mind,</L>
<L>In Female Joys I took a dull Delight,</L>
<L>Slept all the Morn, and Punted half the Night:</L>
<L>But now, with Fears and publick Cares po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>The Church, the Church, for-ever breaks my Re&s;t.</L>
<L>The <HI>Po&s;t-Boy</HI> on my Pillow I explore,</L>
<L>And &s;ift the News of ev'ry foreign Shore,</L>
<L>Studious to find new Friends, and new Allies;</L>
<L>What Armies march from <HI>Sueden</HI> in Di&s;gui&s;e;</L>
<L>How <HI>Spain</HI> prepares her Banners to unfold,</L>
<L>And <HI>Rome</HI> deals out her Ble&s;&s;ings, and her Gold:</L>
<L>Then o'er the Map my Finger, taught to &s;tray,</L>
<L>Cro&s;s many a Region marks the winding Way;</L>
<L>From Sea to Sea, from Realm to Realm I rove,</L>
<L>And grow a mere Geographer by Love.</L>

But &s;till <HI>Avignon,</HI> and the plea&s;ing Coa&s;t</L>
<L>That holds Thee bani&s;h'd, claims my Care the mo&s;t,</L>

<L>Let not our <HI>James,</HI> tho' foil'd in Arms, De&s;pair,</L>

<L>Our well-dre&s;t Rivals grace'd their Sov'raign's Day,</L>

<L>The Land of Love, the <HI>Paphos</HI> of the Town,</L>
<L>Fair Patriots &s;allying oft have put to flight</L>
<L>With all their Poles the Guardians of the Night,</L>
<L>And bore, with Screams of Triumph, to their Side</L>
<L>The Leader's Staff in all its painted Pride.</L>
<L>Nor fears the Hawker in her warbling Note</L>
<L>To vend the di&s;contented State&s;man's Thought.</L>
