<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Ju&s;t Concern for Truth, and the Fir&s;t
Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion,
was the only Motive that engag'd me
in the Examination of your Lord&s;hip's
Docrines in a Former Letter to your Lord&s;hip.
And the &s;ame Motive, I hope, will be thought
a &s;ufficient Apology for my pre&s;uming to give
your Lord&s;hip the Trouble of a Second Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Among&s;t the Vain Contemptible Things,
whereof your Lord&s;hip would create an Abhor|rence
in the Layity, are, the</HI> Trifles <HI>and</HI> Niceties
of Authoritative Benedictions, Ab&s;olutions, Excommu|nications.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ervative, <HI>p.</HI> 98.</NOTE> <HI>Again, you &s;ay, that</HI> to expect the
Grace of God from any Hands, but his own, is to
affront him&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 89.</NOTE>. <HI>And</HI> that all depends upon God
and our &s;elves; That Human Benedictions, Human
Ab&s;olutions, Human Excommunications, have nothing
to do with the Favour of God.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is evident from the&s;e Maxims (for your
Lord&s;hip a&s;&s;erts them as &s;uch) that whatever In|&s;titutions
are ob&s;erved in any Chri&s;tian Society,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
upon this Suppo&s;ition, that thereby Grace is
conferr'd thro' <HI>Human Hands,</HI> or by the Mini&s;try
of the Clergy, &s;uch In&s;titutions ought to be con|demn'd,
and are condemn'd by your Lord&s;hip,
as <HI>trifling, u&s;ele&s;s, and affronting to God.</HI></P>
<P>There is an <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> my Lord, in the <HI>yet</HI> E|&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church of <HI>England,</HI> which we call <HI>Con|firmation:</HI>
It is founded upon the expre&s;s Words
of Scripture, Primitive Ob&s;ervance, and the U|niver&s;al
Practice of all &s;ucceeding Ages in the
Church. The De&s;ign of this In&s;titution is, that
it &s;hould be a Means of conferring Grace, by the
Prayer and Impo&s;ition of the <HI>Bi&s;hop's Hands</HI> on
tho&s;e who have been already Baptized. But yet
again&s;t all this Authority, both Divine and Hu|man,
and the expre&s;s Order of our own Church,
your Lord&s;hip teaches the Layity, <HI>that all Hu|man
Benedictions are u&s;ele&s;s Niceties;</HI> and <HI>that to ex|pect
God's Grace from any Hands but his own, is to
affront him.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;o, my Lord, what &s;hall we &s;ay in De|fence
of the Apo&s;tles? We read (<HI>Acts</HI> 8. 14.)
that when <HI>Philip</HI> the Deacon had baptiz'd the <HI>Sa|maritans,</HI>
the Apo&s;tles &s;ent <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to
them, who having pray'd, and <HI>laid their Hands on
them, they receiv'd the Holy Gho&s;t, who before was
fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in
the Name of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, &s;everal things are here out of Que|&s;tion;
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That &s;omething el&s;e, even in the
Apo&s;tolical Times, was nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides Bap|ti&s;m,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
in order to qualifie Per&s;ons to become com|pleat
Members of the Body, or Partakers of the
Grace of Chri&s;t. They had been baptiz'd, yet
did not receive the Holy Gho&s;t, till the Apo|&s;tles
Hands were laid upon them. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That
God's Graces are not only confer'd by means
of <HI>Human Hands;</HI> but of &s;ome particular Hands,
and not others. 3<HI>dly,</HI> That this Office was &s;o
&s;trictly appropriated to the Apo&s;tles, or Chief
Governours of the Church, that it could not
be perform'd by In&s;pir'd Men, tho' empower'd
to work Miracles, who were of an inferiour
Order; as <HI>Philip</HI> the Deacon. 4<HI>thly,</HI> That the
Power of the Apo&s;tles for the Performance of this
Ordinance, was intirely owing to their &s;upe|riour
Degree in the Mini&s;try; and not to any
extraordinary Gifts they were endow'd with:
For then <HI>Philip</HI> might have perform'd it; who
was not wanting in tho&s;e Gifts, being him&s;elf
an Evangeli&s;t, and Worker of Miracles: Which
is a Demon&s;tration, that his Incapacity aro&s;e
frorn his inferior Degree in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, are all <HI>Human Benedi|ctions
Niceties and Trifles?</HI> Are the Means of God's
Grace in his <HI>own Hands alone?</HI> Is it wicked,
and <HI>affronting to God,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary?
How then comes <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to confer the
Holy Gho&s;t by the Impo&s;ition of their Hands?
How comes it, that they appropriate this Of|fice
to them&s;elves? Is the Di&s;pen&s;ation of
God's Grace in his <HI>own Hands alone?</HI> And yet
can it be di&s;pens'd to us by the Mini&s;try of &s;ome
Per&s;ons, and not by that of others?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Were the Apo&s;tles &s;o wicked, as to di&s;tingui&s;h
them&s;elves by a Pretence to vain Powers, which
God had re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf? And which your
Lord&s;hip &s;uppo&s;es from the Title of your <HI>Pre|&s;ervative,</HI>
that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Common
Sen&s;e,</HI> to imagine that God would, or could have
communicated to Men.</P>
<P>Had any of your Lord&s;hip's well-in&s;tructed
Layity liv'd in the Apo&s;tles Days, with what
Indignation mu&s;t they have rejected this &s;en&s;le&s;s
Chimerical <HI>Claim</HI> of the Apo&s;tles? They mu&s;t
have &s;aid, Why do you, <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> pretend
to this <HI>Bla&s;phemous Power? Whil&s;t we believe
the Go&s;pel, we cannot expect the Grace of God
from any Hands but his own.</HI> You give us the
<HI>Holy Gho&s;t!</HI> You confer the Grace of God! Is
it not impious to think, that <HI>He &s;hould make our
Improvement</HI> in Grace depend upon your Mini|&s;try;
or hang our Salvation on any <HI>particular</HI>
Order of Clergymen? We know, that God is
Ju&s;t, and Good, and True, <HI>and that all</HI> depends
upon Him and our &s;elves, and that <HI>Human Be|nedictions</HI>
are <HI>Tri&s;les.</HI> Therefore whether you
<HI>Peter,</HI> or you <HI>Philip,</HI> or both, or neither of you
lay <HI>your</HI> Hands upon us, we are neither better
nor wor&s;e; but ju&s;t in the <HI>&s;ame State of Grace</HI> as
we were before.</P>
<P>This Repre&s;entation, has not one Syllable in
it, but what is founded in your Lord&s;hip's Do|ctrine,
and perfectly agreeable to it.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
The late mo&s;t Pious and Learned Bi&s;hop
<HI>Beveridge</HI> has the&s;e remarkable Words upon <HI>Con|firmation:</HI>
<Q>How any Bi&s;hops in our Age
dare neglect &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of their
Office, I know not; but fear, they will have
no good Account to give of it, <HI>when they come
to &s;tand before God's Tribunal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Volume of Sermons.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But we may ju&s;tly, and therefore I hope, with
Decency, ask your Lord&s;hip, how you dare per|form
this Part of your Office? For you have
condemn'd it as <HI>Trifling</HI> and <HI>Wicked;</HI> as <HI>Trifling,</HI>
becau&s;e it is an <HI>Human Benediction;</HI> as <HI>Wicked,</HI>
becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es Grace confer'd by the <HI>Hands
of the Bi&s;hop.</HI> If therefore any baptiz'd Per&s;ons
&s;hould come to your Lord&s;hip for Confirmation,
if you are <HI>&s;incere</HI> in what you have deliver'd,
your Lord&s;hip ought, I humbly conceive, to make
them this Declaration.</P>
<Q><P>My Friends, for the &s;ake of <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Or|der,</HI>
I have taken upon me the Epi&s;copal
Character; and, according to Cu&s;tom, which
has long prevaild again&s;t Common Sence,
am now to lay my Hands upon you: But, I
be&s;eech you, as you have any Regard to the
Truth of the Go&s;pel, or to the Honour of
God, not to imagine, there is any Thing in
this Action, more than an u&s;ele&s;s empty Ce|remony:
For if you expect to have any Spi|ritual
Advantage from <HI>Human Benedictions,</HI> or
<PB N="6" REF="8">
to receive Grace from the Impo&s;ition of a Bi|&s;hop's
Hands, you affront God, and in effect,
renounce Chri&s;tianity.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Pray, my Lord con&s;ider that Pa&s;&s;age in the
Scripture, where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of</HI> Leaving
the Principles of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, and going
on unto Perfection; not laying again the Foundation
of Repentance from dead Works, of Faith towards
God, of the Doctrine of Bapti&s;ms, and of Laying on
of Hands, and of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and
of eternal Judgment,(<HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 12.)</P>
<P>My Lord, here it is undeniably plain, that
this Laying on of Hands (which is with us
called <HI>Confirmation</HI>) is &s;o fundamental a Part of
Chri&s;t's Religion, that it is called one of the
Fir&s;t Principles of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t; and
is placed among&s;t &s;uch primary Truths, as the
Re&s;urrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judg|ment.</P>
<P><HI>St.</HI> Cyprian <HI>&s;peaking of this Apo&s;tolical Im|po&s;ition
of Hands, &s;ays,</HI> The &s;ame is now pra|ctis'd
with us; they who have been baptiz'd in the
Church, are brought to the Pre&s;idents of the Church,
that by our Prayer and Impo&s;ition of Hands, they
may receive the Holy Gho&s;t, and be con&s;ummated with
the Lord's Seal.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t we yet believe, that all <HI>Human Be|nedictions</HI>
are Dreams, and the Impo&s;ition of Hu|man
Hands trifling and u&s;ele&s;s; and that to
expect God's Graces from them, is to affront
<PB N="7" REF="9">
him? Tho' the Scriptures expre&s;sly teach us,
that God confers his Grace by means of certain
<HI>particular Human Hands,</HI> and not of others; tho'
they tell us, this <HI>Human Benediction,</HI> this Laying
on of Hands, is one of the fir&s;t Principles of
the Religion of Chri&s;t, and as much a Founda|tion
Doctrine as the Re&s;urrection of the Dead,
and Eternal Judgment; and tho' every Age
&s;ince that of the Apo&s;tles, has &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd it
as &s;uch, and the Authority of our own Church
&s;till requires the Ob&s;ervance of it?</P>
<P>I come now, my Lord, to another Sacred and
Divine In&s;titution of Chri&s;t's Church, which
&s;tands expos'd and condemn'd by your Lord|&s;hip's
Doctrine; and that is, the <HI>Ordination</HI> of
the Chri&s;tian Clergy; where, by means of an
Human Benediction, and the Impo&s;ition of the
Bi&s;hop's Hands, the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
confer'd on Per&s;ons towards con&s;ecrating them
for the Work of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>We find it con&s;tantly taught by the Scriptures,
that all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, and the Graces
whereby the Clergy are qualified and enabl'd to
exerci&s;e their Functions to the Benefit of the
Church, are the Gifts and Graces of the Holy
Spirit. Thus the Apo&s;tle exhorts the Elders <HI>to
take heed unto the Flock, over which the Holy Gho&s;t
hath made them Over&s;eers,</HI> (Eph. 4. 7.) But how,
my Lord, had the Holy Gho&s;t made them Over|&s;eers,
but by the Laying on of the Apo&s;tles
Hands? They were not immediately call'd by
the Holy Gho&s;t; but being con&s;ecrated by <HI>&s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="10">
Human Hands</HI> as had been authorized to that pur|po&s;e,
they were as truly call'd by him, and
&s;anctified with Grace for that Employment, as
if they had receiv'd an immediate or miraculous
Commi&s;&s;ion. So again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> puts <HI>Timothy</HI> in
mind, <HI>to &s;tir up the Gift of God that was in him,
by laying on of his Hands,</HI> (2 Tim. 2. 6.)</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, if <HI>Human Benedictions</HI> be
&s;uch idle <HI>Dreams</HI> arid <HI>Trifles;</HI> if it be <HI>affronting
to God,</HI> to expect his Graces from them, or
through <HI>Human Hands;</HI> do we not plainly want
new Scriptures? Mu&s;t we not give up the Apo|&s;tles
as Furious High-Church Prelates, who a|&s;pir'd
to pre&s;umptuous Claims, and talk'd of
conferring the Graces of God by their own
Hands? Was not this Doctrine as &s;trange and
unaccountable then, as at pre&s;ent? Was it
not as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Attributes and
Sovereignty of God at that time, to have
his Graces pa&s;s through other Hands than his
own, as in any &s;ucceeding Age? Nay, my
Lord, where &s;hall we find any Fathers or Coun|cils,
in the Primitive Church, but who own'd
and a&s;&s;erted the&s;e Powers? They that were &s;o
ready to part with their Lives, rather than do
the lea&s;t Dishonour to God, or the Chiri&s;tian
Name, yet were all guilty of <HI>this horrid Bla&s;phe|my</HI>
in imagining that they were to ble&s;s in
God's Name; and that by the Benediction and
Laying on of the Bi&s;hop's Hands, the Graces of
the Holy Gho&s;t could be confer'd on any
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
Agreeable to the Sence of Scripture and An|tiquity,
our Church u&s;es this Form of Ordina|tion:
<HI>The Bi&s;hop laying his Hands on the Per&s;on's
Head, &s;aith, Receive the Holy Gho&s;t, for the Office
and Work of a Prie&s;t in the Church of God, commit|ted
unto thee, by the Impo&s;ition of our Hands.</HI> From
this Form, it is plain, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that our Church
holds, that the Reception of the Holy Gho&s;t is
nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a Per&s;on a Chri&s;tian
Prie&s;t. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That the Holy Gho&s;t is confer'd
through <HI>Human Hands.</HI> 3<HI>dly,</HI> That it is by the
Hands of a Bi&s;hop that the Holy Gho&s;t is
confer'd.</P>
<P>If therefore your Lord&s;hip is right in your
Doctrine, the Church of <HI>England</HI> is evidently
mo&s;t corrupt. For if it be di&s;honourable and
affronting to God, to expect his Grace from any
Human Hands; it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be di&s;ho|nourable
and affronting to him, for a Bi&s;hop to
pretend to confer it by his Hands. And can
that Church be any ways defended, that has e|&s;tabli&s;h'd
&s;uch an Iniquity by Law, and made
the Form of it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary? How can your
Lord&s;hip an&s;wer it to your Layity, for taking
the Character or Power of a Bi&s;hop from &s;uch
a Form of Words? You tell them, it is affront|ing
to God, to expect his Grace from <HI>Human
Hands;</HI> yet to qualifie your &s;elf for a Bi&s;hoprick,
you let Human Hands be laid on you, after a
manner which directly &s;uppo&s;es you thereby re|ceive
the Holy Gho&s;t! Is it wicked in them to
expect it from <HI>Human Hands?</HI> And is it le&s;s &s;o in
<PB N="10" REF="12">
your Lord&s;hip, to pretend to receive it from Hu|man
Hands? He that believes, it is affronting to
<HI>God,</HI> to expect his Grace from Human Hands,
mu&s;t likewi&s;e believe, that our Form of Ordi|nation,
which promi&s;es the Holy Gho&s;t by the
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s <HI>Hands,</HI> mu&s;t be al&s;o affronting to God.
Certainly, he cannot be &s;aid to be very jealous
of the Honour of God, who will &s;ubmit him|&s;elf
to be made a Bi&s;hop by a Form of Words
derogatory, upon his own Principles, to God's
Honour.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip was to have been
con&s;ecrated to the Office of a Bi&s;hop by the&s;e
Words; <HI>Take thou Power to &s;u&s;tain all things in Be|ing
given thee by my Hands.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, your Lord|&s;hip
would think it intirely Unlawful to &s;ubmit
to the Form of &s;uch an Ordination. But, <HI>my
Lord, receive thou the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. is as impious
a Form, according to your Lord&s;hip's Doctrine,
and equally injurious to the Eternal Power and
Godhead, as the other. For if the Grace of
God can only be had from <HI>his own</HI> Hands, would
it not be as innocent in the Bi&s;hop to &s;ay, <HI>Re|ceive
then Power to &s;u&s;tain all things in Being,</HI> as to
&s;ay, <HI>Receive the Holy Gho&s;t, by the Impo&s;ition of my
Hands?</HI> And would not a Compliance with ei|ther
Form be equally unlawful? According to
your Doctrine, in each of them God's Preroga|tive
is equally invaded; and therefore the Guilt
mu&s;t be the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
It may al&s;o well be wonder'd, how your Lord|&s;hip
can accept of a Character, which is, or
ought to be chiefly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Exerci&s;e
of that Power which you di&s;claim, as in the
Offices of <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>Ordination.</HI> For, my
Lord, where can be the Sincerity of &s;aying,
<HI>Receive the Holy Gho&s;t by the Impo&s;ition of our Hands,</HI>
when you declare it affronting to God, to expect
it from any Hands but his own? Suppo&s;e your
Lord&s;hip had been preaching to the Layity a|gain&s;t
owning any Authority in the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI>
and yet &s;hould acquie&s;ce in the Conditions of
being made a Bi&s;hop in her Name, and by re|cognizing
her Power: Could &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion
be con&s;i&s;tent with Sincerity? Here you forbid
the Layity to expect God's Grace from any
Hands but his; yet not only accept of an Of|fice,
upon Suppo&s;ition of the contrary Doctrine;
but oblige your &s;elf, according to the Sence of
the Church wherein you are ordain'd a Bi&s;hop,
to act frequently in direct Oppo&s;ition to your
own Principles.</P>
<P>So that, I think, it is undeniably plain, that
you have at once, my Lord, by the&s;e Doctrines
condemn'd the Scriptures, the Apo&s;tles, their
martyr'd Succe&s;&s;ors, the Church of <HI>England</HI> and
your own Conduct; and have hereby given us
&s;ome rea&s;on (tho' I wi&s;h, there were no Occa&s;ion
to mention it) to &s;u&s;pect, whether you, who al|low
of no other Church, but what is founded
in Sincerity, are your &s;elf, really a Member of
any Church.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
I &s;hall now proceed to &s;ay &s;omething upon
the Con&s;ecration of the Lord's Supper; which is
as much expos'd as a <HI>Trifle,</HI> by your Lord&s;hip's
Doctrine, as the other In&s;titutions. St. <HI>Paul</HI>
&s;ays. <HI>The Cup of Ble&s;&s;ing which we ble&s;s, is it not
the Communion of the Blood of Chri&s;t?</HI> My Lord,
is not this Cup &s;till to be ble&s;s'd? Mu&s;t there not
therefore be &s;uch a thing as an <HI>Human Benediction?</HI>
And are Human Benedictions to be all de&s;pis'd,
though by them the Bread and Wine become
Means of Grace, and are made the Spiritual
Nouri&s;hment of our Souls? Can any one ble&s;s
this Cup? If not, then there is a Difference be|tween
Human Benedictions: Some are authori|zed
by God, and their Ble&s;&s;ing is effectual;
whil&s;t others, only are vain and pre&s;umptuous. If
the Prayer over the Elements, and the Con&s;e|cration,
be only a Trifle and a Dream; and it
be offen&s;ive to God, to expect they are conver|ted
into Means of Grace by an Human Benedi|ction;
why then did St. <HI>Paul</HI> pretend to ble&s;s
them? Why did he make it the Privilege of the
Church? Or, why do we keep up the &s;ame
Solemnity? But if it be to be ble&s;s'd only by
God's Mini&s;ters, then how can your Lord&s;hip
an&s;wer it to God, for ridiculing and abu&s;ing
Human Benedictions; and telling the World,
that a particular Order of the Clergy are not of
any nece&s;&s;ity, nor can be of any Advantage to
them. For if the Sacrament can only be ble&s;s'd
by God's Mini&s;ters; then &s;uch Mini&s;ters are as
nece&s;&s;ary, as the Sacraments them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, the Cup mu&s;t be ble&s;s'd: If you
&s;ay, any one may ble&s;s it, then, though you
contemn the Benedictions of the Clergy, you
allow of them by every body el&s;e: If every bo|dy
cannot ble&s;s it; then, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, that
the Benedictions of &s;ome Per&s;ons are effectual,
where others are not.</P>
<P>My Lord, the great Sin again&s;t the Holy
Gho&s;t, was the Denial of his Operation in the
Mini&s;try of our Saviour. And how near does
your Lord&s;hip come to it, in denying the Ope|ration
of that &s;ame Spirit, in the Mini&s;ters whom

&s;ame Work that he was. He left his Authority
with them; and promis'd, that the Holy Spirit
&s;hould remain with them to the End of the

Earth, &s;hould be bound in Heaven; and what|&s;oever
they &s;hould loo&s;e on Earth, &s;hould be
loo&s;ed in Heaven; that who&s;oever de&s;pi&s;es them,
de&s;pi&s;es Him, and Him that &s;ent him. And yet
your Lord&s;hip tells us, we need not to trouble
our Heads about any particular Sort of Clergy;
that all is to be tran&s;acted betwixt God and our
&s;elves; that Human Benedictions are infigni&s;i|cant
Trifles.</P>
<P>But pray, what Proof has your Lord&s;hip for
all this? Have you any Scripture for it? Has
God any where declar'd, that no Men on Earth
have any Authority to ble&s;s in his Name? Has
he any where &s;aid, that it is a wicked, pre&s;um|ptuous
<PB N="14" REF="16">
Thing for any one to pretend to it? Has
he any where cold us, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with
his Honour, to be&s;tow his Graces by <HI>Human
Hands?</HI> Has he any where told us, that he has
no Mini&s;ters, no Emba&s;&s;adors on Earth; but
that all his Gifts and Graces are to be receiv'd
immediately from his own Hands? Have you
any Antiquity, Fathers or Councils on your
&s;ide? No: The whole Tenour of Scripture, the
whole Current of Tradition is again&s;t you. Your
Novel Doctrine has only this, to recommend it
to the Libertines of the Age, who univer&s;ally
give into it, that it never was the Opinion of
any Church, or Church-man. It is your Lord|ship's
proper A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>That we offend God in
expecting his Graces from any Hands but his own.</HI></P>
<P>Now it's &s;trange, that God &s;hould be offend|ed
with his own Methods; or that your Lord|&s;hip
&s;hould find us out a Way of plea&s;ing him,
more &s;uitable to his Nature and Attributes, than
what he has taught us in the Scriptures. I call
them his own Methods: For what el&s;e is the

God's Providence; where his Ble&s;&s;ings and Judg|ments

the Chri&s;tian Religion, but a Method of Salva|tion,
where the chief Means of Grace are of|fer'd

<P>We read al&s;o, that <HI>Jo&s;hua was full of the Spirit of

be Per&s;ons whom God has cho&s;en to mini&s;ter

that our Saviour was a greater <HI>Prie&s;t and

therefore they were his true Succe&s;&s;ors: And
&s;ince they did commi&s;&s;ion others to &s;ucceed them
in their Office, by the Impo&s;ition of Hands, as
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> commi&s;&s;ion'd <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to &s;ucceed him; the

as Divine a Call and Commi&s;&s;ion to their Work,
as tho&s;e who were call'd by our Saviour; and are
as truly his Succe&s;&s;ors, as the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves
were.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
From the Places of Scripture above mention|ed,
it is evident; and indeed, from the whole
Tenour of Sacred Writ, that it may con&s;i&s;t with
the Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of God to depute Men
to act in his Name, and be mini&s;terial towards the
Salvation of others; and to lay a Nece&s;&s;ity upon
his Creatures of qualifying them&s;elves for his Fa|vour,
and receiving his Graces by the Hands and
Intervention of mere Men.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, if there be now any Set of
Men upon Earth, that are more peculiarly God's
Mini&s;ters, than others; and thro who&s;e Admini|&s;trations,
Prayers, and Benedictions, God will
accept of returning Sinners, and receive them to
Grace; you have done all you can, to prejudice
People again&s;t them: You have taught the Layi|ty,
that all is to be tran&s;acted between God and
them&s;elves; and that they need not value any
particular &s;ort of Clergy in the World.</P>
<P>I leave it to the Great Judge and Searcher of
Hearts, to judge, from what Principles, or up|on
what Motives your Lord&s;hip has been induc'd
to teach te&s;ethings: But mu&s;t declare, that
for my own part, if I had the greate&s;t Ha|tred
to Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hould think, it could not
be more expre&s;s'd, than by teaching what your
Lord&s;hip has publickly taught. If I could re|joice
in the Mi&s;ery and Ruin of Sinners, I &s;hould
think it &s;ufficient Matter of Triumph, to drive
them from the Mini&s;ters of God, and to put
them upon inventing new Schemes of &s;aving
<PB N="21" REF="23">
them&s;elves, in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to the ordinary
Methods of Salvation appointed by God.</P>
<P>It will not follow from any thing I have &s;aid,
that the Layity have lo&s;t their Chri&s;tian Liber|ty;
or that no body can be &s;av'd, but whom the
Clergy plea&s;e to &s;ave; that they have the arbi|trary
Di&s;po&s;al of Happine&s;s to Mankind. Was
<HI>Abimelech</HI>'s Happine&s;s in the Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>A|braham,</HI>
becau&s;e he was to be receiv'd by means
of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Interce&s;&s;ion? Or could <HI>Job</HI> damn
<HI>Eliphaz,</HI> becau&s;e he was to mediate for him, and
procure his Reconciliation to God.</P>
<P>Neither, my Lord, do the <HI>Chri&s;tian Clergy</HI>
pretend to this de&s;potick Empire over their
Flocks: They don't a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves a Pow|er
to damn the Innocent, or to &s;ave the Guilty:
But they a&s;&s;ert a &s;ober and ju&s;t Right to recon|cile
Men to God; and to act in his Name, in
re&s;toring them to his Favour. They receiv'd
their Commi&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t &s;ent
with full Authority to &s;end others, and with a
Promi&s;e that he would be with them to the End
of the World. From this they conclude, that
they have his Authority; and that in con&s;e|quence
of it, their Admini&s;trations are nece&s;&s;ary,
and effectual to the Salvation of Mankind; and
that none can de&s;pi&s;e Them, but who de&s;pi&s;e
Him that &s;ent them; and are as &s;urely out of the
Covenant of Grace, when they leave &s;uch his
Pa&s;tors, as when they openly de&s;pi&s;e, or omit to
receive his Sacraments.</P>

their Mi&s;&s;ion, or Apo&s;tolical Authority? Did
they teach, that their Natural Infirmities
made them le&s;s the Mini&s;ters of God, or le&s;s
nece&s;&s;ary to the Salvation of Men? Their Per|&s;onal
Defects did not make them depart from the
Claim of tho&s;e Powers they were inve&s;ted with,

Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> this Authority committed to mere

not of Men.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> happens to differ very

to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch In&s;truments to be of any Benefit
to us, is to le&s;&s;en the Sovereignty of God, and in
con&s;equence, his Glory.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip imagines, you have &s;ufficiently
de&s;troy'd the <HI>Sacerdotal Powers,</HI> by &s;hewing, that
the <HI>Clergy</HI> are only Men, and &s;ubject to the
common Frailties of Mankind. My Lord, we
own the Charge; and don't claim any <HI>Sacerdo|tal
Powers</HI> from our Per&s;onal Abilities, or to ac|quire
any Glory to our &s;elves. But, weak as we
are, we are God's Mini&s;ters; and if we are ei|ther
afraid or a&s;ham'd of our Duty, we mu&s;t pe|ri&s;h
<PB N="24" REF="26">
in the Guilt. But is a <HI>Prophet</HI> therefore
proud, becau&s;e he in&s;i&s;ts upon the Authority of
his Mi&s;&s;ion? Can't a Mortal be God's Me&s;&s;en|ger,
and employ'd in his Affairs, but he mu&s;t be
in&s;olent and a&s;&s;uming, for having the Re&s;olution
to own it? If we are to be reprov'd, for preten|ding
to be God's Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e we are but
Men, the Reproach will fall upon Providence;
&s;ince it has plea&s;ed God, chiefly to tran&s;act his
Affairs with Mankind, by the Mini&s;try of their
Brethren.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has not One Word from Scrip|ture
again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Sacerdotal Powers;</HI> no Proof,
that Chri&s;t has not &s;ent Men to be effectual Ad|mini&s;trators
of his Graces: You only a&s;&s;ert, that
there can be no &s;uch Mini&s;ters, becau&s;e they are
mere Men.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ay, that
if the Natural Weakne&s;s of Men makes them in|capable
of being the Instruments of conveying
Grace to their Brethren; if the Clergy can't
be of any U&s;e or Nece&s;&s;ity to their Flocks, for
this Rea&s;on; then it undeniably follows, that
there can be no <HI>po&s;itive In&s;titutions</HI> in the Chri|&s;tian
Religion, that can procure any Spiritual
Advantages to the Members of it; then the Sa|craments
can be no longer any Means of Grace.
For, I hope, no one thinks, that Bread and Wine
have any natural Force or Efficacy, to convey
Grace to the Soul. The Water in Bapti&s;m has the
common Qualities of Water, and is de&s;titute of
any intrin&s;ick Power to clean&s;e the Soul, or
<PB N="25" REF="27">
purifie from Sin. But your Lord&s;hip will not &s;ay,
becau&s;e it has only the common Name of Water,
that therefore it cannot be a Means of Grace.
Why then may not the Clergy tho' they have
the common Nature of Men, be con&s;tituted by
God, to convey his Graces, and to be mini&s;te|rial
to the Salvation of their Brethren? Can God
con&s;ecrate inanimate Things to Spiritual Pur|po&s;es,
and make them the Means of Eternal
Happine&s;s? And is Man the only Creature that
he can't make &s;ub&s;ervient to his De&s;igns? The
only <HI>Being</HI> who is too Weak for an Omnipotent
God to render effectual towards attaining the
Ends of his Grace?</P>
<P>Is it ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, to reject and de&s;pi&s;e
the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Benedictions</HI> of Men, becau&s;e they
are Men like our &s;elves? And is it not as rea&s;o|nable,
to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;prinkling of Water, a
Creature below us, a &s;en&s;ele&s;s and inanimate
Creature?</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip therefore, mu&s;t either find us
&s;ome other Rea&s;on for rejecting the Nece&s;&s;ity of
<HI>Human Admini&s;trations,</HI> than becau&s;e they are
<HI>Human;</HI> or el&s;e give up the Sacraments, and <HI>all</HI>
Po&s;itive In&s;titutions along with them.</P>
<P>Surely, your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t have a mighty O|pinion
of <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Syrian;</HI> who, when the
Prophet bid him go wa&s;h in <HI>Jordan</HI> &s;even times,

of your Argument: If the <HI>Syrian</HI> was right in
de&s;pi&s;ing the Water of <HI>Jordan,</HI> becau&s;e it was
only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; your Lord&s;hip may be right in
de&s;pi&s;ing any particular Order of Clergy; becau&s;e
they are but Men. Your Lord&s;hip is certainly as
right, or as wrong, as he was.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, let the common Sence of
Mankind here judge, whether, if the Clergy are
to be e&s;teem'd as having no Authority, becau&s;e
they are mere Men; it does not plainly follow,
that every thing el&s;e, every In&s;titution that has
not &s;ome <HI>natural</HI> Force and Power to produce
the Effects de&s;igned by it, is not al&s;o to be
rejected as equally Trifling and Ineffectual.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29">
The Sum of the matter is this: It appears
from many expre&s;s Facts, and indeed, from the
whole Series of God's Providence, that it is not
only con&s;i&s;tent with his Attributes; but al&s;o agree|able
to his ordinary Methods of dealing with
Mankind, that he &s;hould &s;ub&s;titute Men to act
in his Name, and be <HI>Authoritatively</HI> employ'd
in conferring his Grace and Favours upon Man|kind.
It appears, that your Lord&s;hip's Argument
again&s;t the Authoritative Admini&s;trations of the
Chri&s;tian Clergy, does not only contradict tho&s;e
Facts, and condemn the ordinary Method of
God's Di&s;pen&s;ations; but likewi&s;e proves the
Sacraments, and every po&s;itive In&s;titution of
Chri&s;tianity to be ineffectual, and as mere <HI>Dreams</HI>
and <HI>Trifles,</HI> as the &s;everal <HI>Offices and Orders</HI> of the
Clergy.</P>
<P>This, I hope, will be e&s;teem'd a &s;ufficient Con|futation
of your Lord&s;hip's Doctrine, by all who
have any true Regard or Zeal for the Chri&s;tian
Religion; and only expect to be &s;av'd by the
Methods of Divine Grace propos'd in the Go&s;|pel.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now in a Word or two &s;et forth the
Sacredne&s;s of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Character, as it is
founded in the New Te&s;tament; with a par|ticular
regard to the Power of conferring Grace,
and the Efficacy of Human Benedictions.]</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
It appears therein, that all Sacerdotal Power
as deriv'd from the Holy Gho&s;t. Our Saviour
him&s;elf took not the <HI>Min&s;try</HI> upon him, till he
had this Con&s;ecration: And during the time of
his Mini&s;try he was under the Guidance and
Direction of the Holy Gho&s;t. Thro' the Holy
Spirit he gave Commandment to the Apo&s;tles
whom he had cho&s;en. When he ordain'd them
to the Work of the Mini&s;try, it was with the&s;e
Words, <HI>Receive the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e whom the
Apo&s;tles ordain'd to the &s;ame Function, it was
by the &s;ame Authority: They laid their Hands
upon the Elders, exhorting them to take care of
she Flock of Chri&s;t, over which the Holy Gho&s;t
had made them Over&s;eers.</P>
<P>Hereby they plainly declar'd, that however this
Office was to de&s;cend from Man to Man through
<HI>Human Hands,</HI> that it was the Holy Gho&s;t which
con&s;ecrated them to that Employment, and gave
them Authority to execute it.</P>
<P>From this it is al&s;o manife&s;t, that the Prie&s;thood
is a Grace of the Holy Gho&s;t; that it is not a
Function founded in the Natural or Civil Rights
of Mankind; but is deriv'd from the Special
Authority of the Holy Gho&s;t; and is as truly a
po&s;itive In&s;titution as the Sacraments. So that
they who have no Authority to alter the Old Sa|craments,
and &s;ub&s;titute New ones, have no Pow|er
to alter the Old Order of the Clergy, or in|troduce
any other Order of them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
For why can we not change the Sacraments?
Is it not, becau&s;e they are only Sacraments, and
operate as they are in&s;tituted by the Holy Gho&s;t?
Becau&s;e they are u&s;ele&s;s ineffectual Rites without
this Authority? And does not the &s;ame Rea&s;on
hold as well for the Order of the Clergy? Does
not the &s;ame Scripture tell us, they are equally
in&s;tituted by the Holy Gho&s;t, and oblige only
by virtue of his Authority? How ab&s;urd is it
therefore, to pretend to aboli&s;h, or depart from
the Settled Order of the Clergy, to make New
Orders, and think any God's Mini&s;ters, unle&s;s
we had his Authority, and could make New
Sacraments, or a New Religion?</P>
<P>My Lord, how comes it, that we cannot alter
the Scriptures? Is it not, becau&s;e they are Di|vinely
in&s;pir'd, and dictated by the Holy Gho&s;t?
And &s;ince it is expre&s;s Scripture, that the <HI>Prie&s;t|hood</HI>
is in&s;tituted and authoriz'd by the &s;ame Ho|ly
Spirit, why is not the Holy Gho&s;t as much to
be regarded in one In&s;titution, as in another?
Why may we not as well make a Go&s;pel, and
&s;ay, it was writ by the Holy Gho&s;t, as make a
New Order of Clergy, and call them His; or e|&s;teem
them as having any relation to him?</P>
<P>From this it likewi&s;e appears, that there is an
ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;trict Succe&s;&s;ion of Au|thoriz'd
Ordainers, from the Apo&s;tolical Times,
in order to con&s;titute a <HI>Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t.</HI> For &s;ince
a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Holy Gho&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary
for the Exerci&s;e of this Office; no one now can
<PB N="30" REF="32">
receive it, but from tho&s;e who have deriv'd their
Authority in a true Succe&s;&s;ion, from the Apo|&s;tles.
We could not, my Lord, call our pre&s;ent
Bibles the <HI>Word of God,</HI> unle&s;s we knew the Co|pies
from which they are taken, were taken from
other true ones, till we come to the Originals
them&s;elves. No more could we call any True
Mini&s;ters, or Authoriz'd by the Holy Gho&s;t, who
have not receiv'd their Commi&s;&s;ion by an unin|terrupted
Succe&s;&s;ion of Lawful Ordainers.</P>
<P>What an Excellent Divine would he be, who
&s;hould tell the World, it was not nece&s;&s;ary that
the &s;everal Copies and Manu&s;cripts, through
which the Scriptures have been tran&s;mitted thro'
different Ages and Languages, &s;hould be all true
ones, and none of them forg'd; that <HI>this was a
thing &s;ubject to &s;o great Uncertainty, that God could
not hang our Salvation on &s;uch Niceties.</HI> Suppo&s;e,
for Proof of this, he &s;hould appeal to the Scrip|tures;
and ask, where any Mention is made of
a&s;certaining the Truth of all the Copies? Would
not this be a Way of Arguing very Theological?
The Application is very ea&s;ie.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has not one Word to prove the
uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of the Clergy a <HI>Tri&s;te</HI>
or <HI>Dream;</HI> but that it is &s;ubject to &s;o great Un|certainty,
and is never mention'd in the Scrip|tures.
And to the Uncertainty of it, it is equally
as uncertain, as whether the Scriptures be <HI>genuine.</HI>
There is ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;ufficient Hi&s;torical Evi|dence
for the Certainty of one, as the other.
As to its not being mention'd in the Scripture,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
the Doctrine upon which it is founded, plainly
made it unnece&s;&s;ary to mention it. Is it need|ful
for the Scriptures to tell us, that if we take
our Bible from any fal&s;e Copy, that it is not the
Word of God? Why then need they tell us, that
if we are Ordain'd by U&s;urping Fal&s;e Pretend|ers
to Ordination, not deriving their Authority
to that end from the Apo&s;tles, that we are no
Prie&s;ts? Does not the thing it &s;elf &s;peak as plain
in one Ca&s;e, as in the other? The Scriptures are
only of u&s;e to us, as they are the Word of God:
We cannot have this Word of God, which was
written &s;o many Years ago, unle&s;s we receive it
from Authentick Copies and Manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>The Clergy have their Commi&s;&s;ion from the
Holy Gho&s;t: The Power of conferring this
Commi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, was left with
the Apo&s;tles: Therefore the pre&s;ent Clergy can|not
have the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, or Call, but from
an Order of Men, who have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively con|vey'd
his Power from the Apo&s;tles to the pre&s;ent
time. So that, my Lord, I &s;hall beg leave to
lay it down, as a plain, undeniable, Chri&s;tian
Truth, that the Order of the Clergy is an Order
of as nece&s;&s;ary Obligation, as the Sacraments;
and as unalterable as the Holy Scriptures; the
&s;ame Holy Gho&s;t being as truly the Author and
Founder of the Prie&s;thood, as the In&s;titutor of
the Sacraments, or the In&s;pirer of tho&s;e Divine
Oracles. And when your Lord&s;hip &s;hall offer
any fre&s;h Arguments to prove, that no particular
&s;ort of Clergy is nece&s;&s;ary; that the Benedicti|ons
and Admini&s;trations of the pre&s;ent Clergy
<PB N="32" REF="34">
of our mo&s;t Excellent Church, are Trifling
Niceties; if I cannot &s;hew, that the &s;ame Argu|ments
will conclude again&s;t the Authority of the
Sacraments and the Scriptures, I faithfully pro|mi&s;e
your Lord&s;hip to become a Convert to your
Doctrine.</P>
<P>What your Lord&s;hip charges upon your Ad|ver&s;aries,
as an Ab&s;urd Doctrine, in pretending
the Nece&s;&s;ity of one regular, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, and
particular Order of the Clergy, is a True Chri|&s;tian
Doctrine; and as certain from Scripture,
as that we are to keep to the In&s;titution of par|ticular
Sacraments; or not to alter tho&s;e parti|cular
Scriptures, which now compo&s;e the Canon
of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>By Authoritative Benediction, we do not
mean any Natural or Intrin&s;ick Authority of
our own: But a Commi&s;&s;ion from God, to be
Effectual Admini&s;trators of his Ordnances, and
to ble&s;s in his Name. Thus, a Per&s;on who is
&s;ent from God to foretel things, of which he had
before no Knowledge or Notion, or to denounce
Judgments, which he has no Natural Power to
execute, may be truly &s;aid to be an <HI>Authoritative
Prophet;</HI> becau&s;e he has the Authority of God for
what he does. Thus, when the Bi&s;hop is &s;aid to
confer Grace in Confirmation; this is properly
an <HI>Authoritative Benediction;</HI> becau&s;e he is then as
truly doing what God has commi&s;&s;ion'd him to
do, as when a Prophet declares upon what Er|rand
he is &s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
'Tis in this Sence, my Lord, that the People
are &s;aid to be <HI>Authoritatively</HI> ble&s;s'd by the Re|gular
Clergy; becau&s;e they are <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Clergy,</HI> and
act by his Commi&s;&s;ion; bacau&s;e by their Hands
the People receive the Graces and Benefits of
God's Ordinances; which they have no more
Rea&s;on to expect from other Mini&s;ters of their
own Election, or if the Word may be us'd in an
abu&s;ive Sence, of their own <HI>Con&s;ecration,</HI> than
to receive Grace from Sacraments of their
own Appointment. The Scriptures teach us,
that the Holy Gho&s;t has in&s;tituted an Order of
Clergy: We &s;ay, a Prie&s;thood &s;o authoriz'd,
can no more be chang'd by us, than we can
change the Scriptures, or make New Sacra|ments,
becau&s;e they are all founded on the
&s;ame Authority, without any Power of a
Di&s;pen&s;ation delegated to us in one Ca&s;e more
than in another. If therefore we have a mind
to continue in the Covenant of Chri&s;t, and
receive the Grace and Benefit of his Ordi|nances,
we mu&s;t receive them through &s;uch
Hands as he has authoriz'd for that Purpo&s;e,
to the end we may be qualify'd to partake the
Ble&s;&s;ings of them. For as a <HI>True</HI> Prie&s;t can|not
benefit us by admini&s;tring a <HI>Fal&s;e</HI> Sacra|ment;
&s;o a <HI>True</HI> Sacrament is nothing, when
it is admini&s;tred by a <HI>Fal&s;e Uncommi&s;&s;ion'd Mi|ni&s;ter.</HI>
Be&s;ides this Benediction which attends
the Ordinances of God, when they are thus
perform'd by authoriz'd Hands; there is a Be|nediction
of Prayer, which we may ju&s;tly think
very effectual, when pronounc'd or di&s;pens'd by
the &s;ame Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">
Thus when the Bi&s;hop or Prie&s;t intercedes for
the Congregation, or pronounces the Apo&s;to|lical
Benediction upon them, we do not con|&s;ider
this barely as an Act of Charity and
Humanity, of one Chri&s;tian praying for ano|ther;
but as the Work of a Per&s;on who is
commi&s;&s;ion'd by God&punc; to <HI>ble&s;s in his Name,</HI> and be
effectually mini&s;terial in the Conveyance of his
Graces; or as the Prayer of one who is left
with us in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, to carry on his
great De&s;ign of &s;aving us; and who&s;e Bene|dictions
are ever ratify'd in Heaven, but when
we render our &s;elves, in one re&s;pect or other,
incapable of them.</P>
<P>Now, my Lord, they are the&s;e <HI>Sacerdotal
Prayers,</HI> the&s;e Authoriz'd Sacraments, the&s;e Com|mi&s;&s;ion'd
Pa&s;tors, whom the Holy Gho&s;t has
made Over&s;eers of the Flock of Chri&s;t, that
your Lord&s;hip encourages the Layity to de|&s;pi&s;e.
You bid them <HI>contemn the vain Words of
Validity or Invalidity of God's Ordinances;</HI> to <HI>heed
no particular &s;ort of Clergy, or the pretended Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of their Admini&s;trations.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip &s;ets up in this Controver&s;ie
for an Advocate for the Layity, again&s;t the
<HI>Arrogant Pretences,</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;e Claims</HI> of the Cler|gy.
My Lord, we are no more contending
for our &s;elves in this Doctrine, than when we
in&s;i&s;t upon any Article in the Creed. Nei|ther
is it any more our particular Cau&s;e, when
we a&s;&s;ert our Mi&s;&s;ion, than when we a&s;&s;ert the
Nece&s;&s;ity of the Sacraments.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
Who is to receive the Benefit of that Com|mi&s;&s;ion
which we a&s;&s;ert, but They? Who is to

this Order, and make what other Orders he
prefers to it? This your Lord&s;hip cannot re&s;olve

That as he had as much Authority from
<PB N="39" REF="41">
Chri&s;t, to Ordain Clergy, as your Lord&s;hip,
he would not depart from his Chri&s;tian Li|berty.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould remon&s;trate to your Lord&s;hip in

only reduce your Lord&s;hip's own Doctrine to

have taught not to regard any particular &s;ort of

are at all nece&s;&s;ary; and that it's as lawful

<P><HI>The next thing to be con&s;ider'd, my Lord, is

Ab&s;olution. An infallible Ab&s;olution cannot belong to
fallible Men. But no Ab&s;olution can be Authoritative,
which is not Infallible. Therefore no Authoritative Ab|&s;olution
can belong to any Man living.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ervative, <HI>p.</HI> 92.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, your Lord&s;hip does not
reject this <HI>Ab&s;olution,</HI> becau&s;e the Claim of it is
not founded in Scripture; but by an Argument
drawn from the nature of the Thing: Becau&s;e
you imagine, &s;uch Ab&s;olution requires Infallibi|lity
for the Execution of it; therefore it can|not
belong to Men. Should this be true, it
would prove, that if our Saviour had really &s;o
intended, he could not have given this Power
to his Mini&s;ters. But, my Lord, who can &s;ee any
Repugnancy in the Rea&s;on of the Thing it &s;elf?
Is it not as ea&s;ie to conceive, that our Lord
&s;hould confer his Grace of Pardon by the Hands
of his Mini&s;ters, as by Means of the Sacra|ments?
And may not &s;uch Ab&s;olution be ju&s;tly
called <HI>Authoritative,</HI> the Power of which is gran|ted,
and executed by his Authority?</P>
<P>Is it impo&s;&s;ible for Men to have this Authori|ty
from God, becau&s;e they may mi&s;take in the
Exerci&s;e of it? This Argument proves too
much; and makes as &s;hort work with every In|&s;titution
of Chri&s;tianity, as with this Power of
Ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>For if it is impo&s;&s;ible, that Men &s;hould have
Authority from God to Ab&s;olve in his Name,
becau&s;e they are not Infallible; this makes them
equally incapable of being entru&s;ted with any
other Means of Grace; and con&s;equently,
&s;uppo&s;es the whole Prie&s;ts Office to imply a di|rect
Impo&s;&s;bility in the very Notion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
Your Lord&s;hip's Argument is this: Chri&s;tians
have their Sins pardon'd upon certain Conditi|ons;
but Fallible Men cannot certainly know
the&s;e Conditions; therefore Fallible Men cannot
have Authority to <HI>Ab&s;olve.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I take occa&s;ion to argue thus:
Per&s;ons are to be admitted to the Sacraments
on certain Conditions; But Fallible Men can|not
tell, whether they come qualified to receive
them according to the&s;e Conditions; Therefore
Fallible Men cannot have Authority to admi|ni&s;ter
the Sacraments.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> This Argument &s;ubverts all Authority
of the Chri&s;tian Religion it &s;elf, and the Rea|&s;on
of every in&s;tituted Means of Grace. For
if nothing can be Authoritative, but what a
Man is infallibly a&s;&s;ured of; then the Chri&s;tian
Religion cannot be an Authoritative Method of
Salvation; &s;ince a Man, by being a Chri&s;tian,
does not become infallibly certain of his Salvati|on:
Nor does Grace infallibly attend the Parti|cipation
of the Sacraments. So that tho' your
Lord&s;hip has form'd this Argument only again&s;t
this Ab&s;olving Power; yet it has as much Force
again&s;t the Sacraments, and the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion
it &s;elf. For if it be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e,
that the Prie&s;t &s;hould ab&s;olve any one, becau&s;e
he cannot be certain that he de&s;erves Ab&s;olution;
does it not imply the &s;ame Ab&s;urdity, to &s;uppo&s;e,
that he &s;hould have the Power of Admini&s;tring
the Sacraments, when he cannot be <HI>infallibly
<PB N="42" REF="44">
rtain,</HI> that tho&s;e who receive them, are duly
qualified? If a Po&s;&s;ibility of Error de&s;troys the
Power in one Ca&s;e, it as certainly de&s;troys it
in the other. Again, if Ab&s;olution cannot be
Authoritative, unle&s;s it be Infallible; then, it is
plain, that the Chri&s;tian Religion is not an
Authoritative Means of Salvation; becau&s;e all
Chri&s;tians are not infallibly &s;av'd: Nor can the
Sacraments be Authoritative Means of Grace;
becau&s;e <HI>all</HI> who partake of them, do not infalli|bly
obtain Grace.</P>

<P>Pray, my Lord, con&s;ider the Nature of Sa|craments.

But is God therefore excluded from any Power

it? Why then, my Lord, mu&s;t that Impo&s;ition

all their Power and Efficacy to his In&s;titution;

My Lord, you take no notice of Scripture;

<P>The Clergy ju&s;tly claim a Power of Recon|ciling

Per&s;ons from the Church of God, they
injure only them&s;elves. But, my Lord, are

<P>Can you prove, my Lord, that they are not
nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e they have not always the

which is only effectual on <HI>certain Con|ditions?</HI>
Is not the Chri&s;tian Religion nece&s;|&s;ary
to Salvation, tho' all Chri&s;tians are not &s;av'd?
Are not the Sacraments nece&s;&s;ary Means of
Grace, tho' the Means of Grace obtain'd there|by
is only Conditional? Is every one nece&s;&s;a|rily
improv'd in Grace, who receives the Sacra|ment?
Or is it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the &s;a|lutary

Is Ab&s;olution nothing, becau&s;e if

be given them in this Text, it cannot be inter|preted,
as having entitled them properly to any

from this Text pretend to the Power of the
Sword, to make People Members of this
Kingdom: Mu&s;t not the An&s;wer be, that he
mi&s;takes the Power, by not con&s;idering, that
they are only the <HI>Keys</HI> of a <HI>Spiritual,</HI> not of a
Temporal Kingdom, which were here deliver'd
to the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>I humbly pre&s;ume, my Lord, that this would
be as good an An&s;wer to your Lord&s;hip's Doctrine,
as to Theirs, who claim the Right of the Sword.
till it can be &s;hewn that <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s, Sight</HI>
and <HI>Limbs,</HI> do not as truly relate to the Things
of this World as the Power of the Sword.</P>
<P>If this Power of the Keys mu&s;t be under&s;tood,
only as a Power of inflicting or curing Di&s;ea&s;es;
then the Words, in the proper Con&s;truction of
them, mu&s;t run thus: <HI>Thou art</HI> Peter, <HI>and upon this
Rock I will build my Church,</HI> i. e. a peculiar Socie|ty
of Healthful People, <HI>and the Gates of Hell &s;hall
never prevail again&s;t it;</HI> i. e. They &s;hall always
be in a State of Health. <HI>I will give unto Thee, the
Keys of this Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> i. e. Thou &s;halt
have the Power of inflicting and curing Di&s;tem|pers;
<HI>and what&s;oever thou &s;halt bind on Earth, &s;hall be
<PB N="56" REF="58">
bound in Heaven,</HI> i.e. on whom&s;oever thou &s;halt inflict
the Lepro&s;ie on Earth. He &s;hall be a Leper in
Heaven; <HI>and what&s;oever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on Earth,
&s;hall be loos'd in Heaven,</HI> i. e. whom&s;oever thou &s;halt
cure of that Di&s;ea&s;e on Earth, &s;hall be perfectly
cur'd of it in Heaven.</P>
<P>This, without putting any Force upon the Words,
is your Lord&s;hip's own Interpretation; which ex|po&s;es
the Honour and Authority of Scriptures as
much as the greate&s;t Enemy to them can wi&s;h. If
our Saviour cou'd mean by the&s;e Words, only a
<HI>Power</HI> of <HI>healing Di&s;tempers;</HI> or if the Apo&s;tles un|der&s;tood
them in that Sence, we may as well be|lieve,
that when He &s;aid, <HI>His Kingdom was not of
this World,</HI> that he meant, it was of this World;
and that the Apo&s;tles &s;o under&s;tood him too.</P>
<P><HI>But however, for the Benefit and Edification
of the Layity, your Lord&s;hip has another Interpre|tation
for them: You &s;ay,</HI> if they <HI>(the Apo&s;tles)</HI>
did apply this Power of remitting Sins to the certain Ab|&s;olution
of particular Per&s;ons, it is plain, they could do
it upon no other Bottom but this; that God's Will, and
good Plea&s;ure, about &s;uch particular Per&s;ons was infal|libly
communicated to them.</P>
<P>Pray my Lord, how, or where is this &s;o plain?
Is it plain, that they never baptiz'd Per&s;ons, till
God had <HI>infallibly communicated his good Plea&s;ure to
them about &s;uch particular Per&s;ons?</HI> Bapti&s;m is an In|&s;titution
equally Sacred with this other, and puts
the Per&s;on baptiz'd in the &s;ame State of Grace,
<HI>that Ab&s;olution</HI> does the Penitent. Bapti&s;m is de|&s;ign'd
<PB N="57" REF="59">
for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin. It is an Ordi|nance
to which Ab&s;olution is con&s;equent, but I
&s;uppo&s;e, Per&s;ons may be baptiz'd without &s;uch
<HI>Infallible Communication</HI> promi&s;ed, as your Lord&s;hip
contends for. If therefore it be not nece&s;&s;ary for
the Exerci&s;e of Ab&s;olution by Bapti&s;m, why mu&s;t
it be nece&s;&s;ary for Ab&s;olution by the Impo&s;ition
of Hands?</P>
<P>Can Pa&s;tors without Infallibility, baptize Hea|thens,
and ab&s;olve, or be the In&s;truments of ab&s;ol|ving
them thereby from their Sins? Are they
not as able to ab&s;ove Chri&s;tian Penitents, or re|&s;tore
tho&s;e who have Apo&s;tatiz'd? If Human
Knowledge, and the common Rules of the Church,
be &s;ufficient to direct the Prie&s;t to whom he
ought to admini&s;ter the Sacraments; they are
al&s;o &s;ufficient for the Exerci&s;e of this other Part
of the Sacerdotal Office.</P>
<P>But your Lord&s;hip proceeds thus: <HI>Not that they</HI>
them&s;elves <HI>Ab&s;olved any.</HI></P>
<P>No, my Lord, no more than Water in Bap|ti&s;m
of <HI>it &s;elf</HI> purifies the Soul from Sin. This
Bapti&s;mal Water, is, notwith&s;tanding nece&s;&s;ary
or the Remi&s;&s;ion of our Sins.</P>
<P>Again you &s;ay, <HI>Not that God was oblig'd to bind
and loo&s;e the Guilt of Aden, according to their De|clarations,
con&s;idered as their own Deci&s;ions, and
their own Determinations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page</NOTE>. No, my Lord; who|ever.
<PB N="58" REF="60">
ever thought &s;o? God is not oblig'd to confer
(race by the <HI>Bapti&s;mal Water,</HI> con&s;ider'd only as
<HI>Water;</HI> but He is, con&s;ider'd as <HI>his own In&s;titution</HI>
for that End and Purpo&s;e. So, if the&s;e Decla|rations
are con&s;ider'd only as <HI>the Declarations of
Men,</HI> God is not obliged by them: But when
they are con&s;ider'd as the Declarations of <HI>Men</HI>
whom he has e&s;pecially Authoriz'd to make
<HI>&s;uch</HI> Declarations in his Name, then they are
as effectual with God, as any other of his In&s;ti|tution's
whatever.</P>
<P>I proceed now to a Paragraph that bears as
hard upon our Saviour, as &s;ome others have done
upon his Apo&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors; where
your Lord&s;hip de&s;igns to prove, that though
Chri&s;t claim'd a Power of remitting Sins Him|&s;elf,
or in his own Per&s;on, yet that he had re|ally
no &s;uch Power.</P>
<P><HI>You go upon the&s;e Words:</HI> If we look back upon
our Saviour him&s;elf, we &s;hall find, that when he de|clares
that the Son of Man had Power upon Earth to
forgive Sins, even He him&s;elf either meant by it, the
Power of a miraculous Relea&s;ing Man from his Affli|ction;
or if it related to another more Spiritual Sence
of the Words, the Power of declaring, that the Man's
Sins were forgiven by God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ervative, <HI>p.</HI> 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">
The Words of our Saviour, which we are to
look back upon, are the&s;e: <HI>Whether is it ea&s;ier to
&s;ay, thy Sins are forgiven thee; or to &s;ay, ari&s;e, take
up thy Bed and walk? But that ye may know, the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins,</HI>
(Mark 2. 9, 10.) As if he had &s;aid, <Q>Is not the
&s;ame Divine Authority and Power requir'd?
Is it not a Work as peculiar to God, to per|form
miraculous Cures, as to forgive Sins?
The Rea&s;on therefore, why I now chu&s;e to
declare my Authority, rather by &s;aying, <HI>Thy
Sins are forgiven thee,</HI> than by &s;aying, <HI>Ari&s;e and
walk,</HI> was, purely to teach you this Truth,
that the Power of the Son of Man is not con|fin'd
to Bodily Cures; but that he has Power
on Earth to forgive Sins.</Q></P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the fir&s;t obvious Sence of
the Words; and therefore I take it to be the
True Sence. But your Lord&s;hip can look back
upon them, till you find, that Chri&s;t has not
this Power, though he claims it expre&s;sly; but
that he only intends a Power of doing <HI>&s;ome|thing
or other,</HI> which no more imports a Power
of forgiving Sins, than of remitting any Tem|poral
Debt or Penalty.</P>
<P>If our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had intended to teach
the World, that he was inve&s;ted with this Power,
I would gladly know, how he mu&s;t have ex|pre&s;s'd
him&s;elf, to have &s;atisfy'd your Lord&s;hip
that he really had it? He mu&s;t have told you,
that he had not this Power; and then po&s;&s;ibly,
<PB N="60" REF="62">
your Lord&s;hip would have taught us, that he had
this Power. For no one can di&s;cover any Rea|&s;on
why you &s;hould deny it him; but becau&s;e
he has in expre&s;s Words claim'd and a&s;&s;erted it.
I hope, your Lord&s;hip has not &s;o low an Opini|on
of our Saviour's Per&s;on, as to think it unrea|&s;onable
in the Nature of the Thing, that He
&s;hould have this Power. Where does it contra|dict
any Principle of Rea&s;on, to &s;ay, that a <HI>King</HI>
&s;hould be able to pardon his Subjects? Since
there is no Ab&s;urdity then in the Thing it &s;elf;
and it is &s;o expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted in Scripture; it is
ju&s;t Matter of Surprize, that your Lord&s;hip &s;hould
carry your Reader from a plain con&s;i&s;tent Sence
of the Words, to <HI>either this or that Something or o|ther,</HI>
the Origin whereof is only to be &s;ought
for in your Lord&s;hip's own Invention; rather
than not exclude Chri&s;t from a Power which he
declar'd he had, and declar'd he had it for this
very Rea&s;on, <HI>that we might know that he had it.</HI>
Our Saviour has told us, that the Way to Hea|ven
is <HI>narrow.</HI> Your Lord&s;hip might as rea&s;ona|bly
prove from hence, that he meant, it was
<HI>broad,</HI> as that he did not mean he could forgive
Sins, when he &s;aid, <HI>that ye may know, that the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has rejected all <HI>Church Authori|ty,</HI>
and de&s;pis'd the pretended <HI>Powers</HI> of the
Clergy, for this rea&s;on; becau&s;e Chri&s;t is the
<HI>&s;ole King, &s;ole Lawgiver, and Judge in his King|dom.</HI>
But, it &s;eems, your Lord&s;hip, notwith|&s;tanding,
thinks it now time to depo&s;e him:
And this <HI>&s;ole King</HI> in <HI>his own Kingdom,</HI> mu&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="63">
not be allow'd to be capable of pardoning his
own Subjects.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, my Lord; is deliver'd, I &s;up|po&s;e,
as your other Doctrines, out of a hearty
Concern and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Zeal for the Privileges
of the Layity; and to &s;hew, that your Lord|&s;hip
is not only able to limit as you plea&s;e,
the Authority of <HI>Temporal Kings;</HI> but al&s;o to
make Chri&s;t him&s;elf <HI>&s;ole King,</HI> and yet <HI>no King,</HI>
in his Spiritual Kingdom. For, my Lord, the
Kingdom of Chri&s;t is a Society, founded in
order to the Reconciliation of Sinners to God.
If therefore Chri&s;t could not pardon Sins, to
what End could he either erect, or how could
he &s;upport his Kingdom, which is only in the
great and la&s;t De&s;ign of it, to con&s;i&s;t of Ab|&s;olv'd
Sinners? He that cannot forgive Sins
in a Kingdom that is erected for the Re|mi&s;&s;ion
of Sins, can no more be <HI>&s;ole King</HI> in
it, than he that has no <HI>Temporal Power,</HI> can
be <HI>&s;ole King</HI> in a <HI>Temporal Kingdom.</HI> Therefore
your Lord&s;hip has been thus mighty &s;erviceable
to the Chri&s;tian Layity, as to teach them, that
Chri&s;t is not only <HI>&s;ole King,</HI> but <HI>no King</HI> in his
Kingdom.</P>
<P>This is not the Fir&s;t Contradiction your
Lord&s;hip has unhappily fallen into, in your At|tempts
upon <HI>Kingly Authority.</HI> Not is it the Ia&s;t;
which I &s;hall pre&s;ume to ob&s;erve to the <HI>Common
Sen&s;e</HI> of your Layity.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">
Again, in this Account of our Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour,
your Lord&s;hip has made no difference
between Him and his Apo&s;tles, as to this
<HI>Ab&s;olving Authority.</HI> For you &s;ay, the <HI>Great
Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> given to them, imply'd either a
Power of Relea&s;ing Men from their Bodily
Afflictions; or of declaring &s;uch to be par|don'd,
whom God had a&s;&s;ur'd them that he
had pardon'd: And this is <HI>all</HI> that you here
allow to Chri&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's calling him &s;o often <HI>King,</HI>
and <HI>&s;ole King, &amp;c.</HI> in his Kingdom, and yet
making him a <HI>Mere Creature</HI> in it, is too
like the In&s;ult, and de&s;ign'd Sarca&s;m of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who, when they had nail'd him to the
Cro&s;s, writ over his Head, <HI>This is the King of
the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed: Your Lord&s;hip proves,
That our Saviour had not the Power of
<HI>forgiving Sins;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>His Way of Expre&s;&s;ion
was. Thy Sins are forgiven thee. This was plainly
to acknowledge, and keep up that True Notion,
that God alone forgiveth Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Let us therefore put this Argument in Form.
Chri&s;t has affirm'd, that he had Power to for|give
Sins: But his Way was, to &s;ay, <HI>Thy Sins
are forgiven thee:</HI> Therefore Chri&s;t had not
Power to forgive Sins. Q. E. D.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">
It is much, your Lord&s;hip did not recommend this
to your Layity as another <HI>Invincible Demon&s;tration.</HI>
For by the help of it, my Lord, they may prove,
that our Saviour could no more <HI>heal Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> than
<HI>forgive Sins.</HI> As thus; Chri&s;t indeed pretends to
a Power of Healing Di&s;ea&s;es; but his u&s;ual way
of &s;peaking to the di&s;eas'd Per&s;on, was, <HI>Thy Faith
hath made Thee whole;</HI> therefore He had not the
Power of <HI>Healing</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es. The Argument has
the &s;ame force again&s;t one Power, as again&s;t the
other. If He did not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> becau&s;e he &s;aid,
<HI>thy Sins are forgiven Thee;</HI> no more did He heal
Di&s;ea&s;es, becau&s;e he &s;aid, <HI>thy Faith hath, made Thee
whole.</HI></P>
<P>I have a Claim of &s;everal Debts upon a Man:
I forgive him them all, in the&s;e Words, <HI>Thy Debts
are remitted Thee.</HI> A Philo&s;ophical Wit &s;tands by,
and pretends to prove, that I had not the
Power, of remitting the&s;e Debts; becau&s;e I
&s;aid, <HI>Thy Debts are remitted Thee.</HI> What can come up
to, or equal &s;uch <HI>profound Philo&s;ophy,</HI> but the
<HI>Divinity,</HI> of one who teaches, our Saviour could
not forgive Sins, becau&s;e He &s;aid, <HI>Thy Sins are
forgiven Thee?</HI></P>
<P>But your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, the Rea&s;on why
our Saviour thus expre&s;&s;ed Him&s;elf, <HI>Thy Sins
are forgiven Thee, was plainly to keep up that true
Notion, that God alone forgiveth Sins.</HI> There|fore,
my Lord, according to this Doctrine,
our Saviour was oblig'd not to claim any
<PB N="64" REF="66">
Power that was <HI>peculiar</HI> or <HI>appropriated</HI> to God,
<HI>alone.</HI> For if this be an Argument, why He
&s;hould not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> it is al&s;o an Argument,
that He ought not to claim any other Pow|er,
any more than this; which is proper to
God, and only belongs to Him. But, my
Lord, if He did expre&s;s him&s;elf thus, that
he might not lay Claim to any thing that
was peculiar to God, how came He in &s;o ma|ny
other Re&s;pects, to lay Claim to &s;uch
things, as are as truly peculiar to God, as
the Forgivene&s;s of Sins? How came He in &s;o
many In&s;tances to make Him&s;elf equal to God?
How came He to &s;ay, <HI>Ye believe in God, be|lieve
al&s;o in me? And that Men &s;hould Wor&s;hip
the Son, even as the Father?</HI> That He was the
Son of God; That he was the Way, the
Truth, and the Life?</P>
<P>Are not Evangelical Faith, Wor&s;hip and
Tru&s;t, Duties that are &s;olely due to God?
Does He not as much invade the Sovereign|ty
of God, who lays claim to the&s;e Duties,
as He that pretends to <HI>forgive Sins?</HI> Did not
Chri&s;t al&s;o give his Di&s;ciples <HI>Power and Au|thority</HI>
over Devils and Unclean Spirits, and
Power to heal all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es?
<PB N="65" REF="67">
Now, if Chri&s;t did not a&s;&s;ume a Power to <HI>forgive
Sins,</HI> becau&s;e God alone could forgive Sins, it is
al&s;o as unaccountable, that He &s;hould exerci&s;e
other <HI>Authorities</HI> and Powers which are as &s;trictly
peculiar to God, as that of forgiving Sins. As if
a Per&s;on &s;hould di&s;own that Chri&s;t is Omni&s;cient,
becau&s;e Omni&s;cience is an <HI>Attribute</HI> of God <HI>Alone;</HI>
and yet confe&s;s his Omnipotence, which is an
Attribute equally <HI>Divine.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, my Lord: Did our Saviour thus
de&s;ignedly expre&s;s him&s;elf, lea&s;t He &s;hould be
thought to a&s;&s;ume any Power which was Di|vine,
then it is certain (according to this Opi|nion)
that if He had a&s;&s;umed any &s;uch Power,
or pretended to do what was peculiar to God,
he had been the Occa&s;ion of mi&s;leading Men in|to
Error. For if this be a plain Rea&s;on, why He
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o as to di&s;own this Power, it
is plain, that if He had own'd it. He had been
condemn'd by this Argument, as teaching fal&s;e
Doctrine.</P>
<P>Now if this would have been interpretatively
fal&s;e Doctrine in Chri&s;t, to take upon Him&s;elf
any thing that was peculiar to God, the Apo&s;tles
were guilty of propagating this fal&s;e Doctrine.
For there is &s;carce any known Attribute or
Power of God, but they a&s;cribe it to our Savi|our.
They declare him Eternal, Omnipotent,
Omni&s;cient, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Is it not a <HI>true Notion,</HI> that
God alone can Create, and is Governour of the
Univer&s;e? Yet the Apo&s;tles expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ure us
of Chri&s;t, that <HI>all things were created by Him,</HI> and
<PB N="66" REF="68">
that <HI>God hath put all things in Subjection under his
Feet.</HI> 'Tis very &s;urpri&s;ing, that your Lord&s;hip
&s;hould exclude Chri&s;t from this Power of <HI>for|giving</HI>
Sins, tho' he has expre&s;ly &s;aid He could
forgive Sins, becau&s;e &s;uch a Power belongs only
to God; when it appears thro' the whole Scri|pture,
that there is &s;carce any Divine Power
which our Saviour him&s;elf has not claim'd, nor
any Attribute of God, but what his Apo&s;tles have
a&s;crib'd to him. They have made Him the <HI>Cre|ator,</HI>
the <HI>Pre&s;erver,</HI> the <HI>Governour</HI> of the Univer&s;e,
the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey
him; and yet your Lord&s;hip tells us, that He did
not pretend to <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> becau&s;e that was a
Power peculiar to God.</P>
<P>Here is then (to &s;peak in your Lord&s;hip's ele|gant
Style) an <HI>immoveable Re&s;ting-Place</HI> for your
Laity to &s;et their Feet upon; here is an <HI>Argu|ment
that will la&s;t them for ever;</HI> They mu&s;t believe
that our Saviour did not forgive Sins, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> this
was a Power that belong'd to God, tho' the Scri|ptures
a&s;&s;ure us that every other Divine Power
belong'd to Chri&s;t. That is, they mu&s;t believe,
that tho' our Saviour claim'd all Divine Powers,
yet not this Divine Power, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it is a Divine
Power. And, my Lord, if they have the com|mon
Sen&s;e to believe this, they may al&s;o believe
that tho' our Saviour took human Nature upon
him, yet that he had not a human Soul, becau&s;e it
is proper to Man. They may believe, that any
Per&s;on who has all Kingly Power, cannot remit
or reprieve a Malefactor, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it is an Act of
Kingly Power to do it; or that a Bi&s;hop cannot
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;u&s;pend any Offender of his Dioce&s;e, becau&s;e it
is an Act of Epi&s;copal Power to do it. All the&s;e
Rea&s;ons are as &s;trong and <HI>Demon&s;trative</HI> as that
Chri&s;t, who claim'd all Divine Powers, could
not forgive Sins, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it was a <HI>Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, In this Argument your Lord&s;hip has
plainly declar'd again&s;t the Divinity of Chri&s;t,
and rank'd him in the Order of Creatures. Your
Lord&s;hip &s;ays, Chri&s;t did not forgive Sins, be|cau&s;e
it is God <HI>alone who can forgive Sins;</HI> as plain
an Argument as can be offer'd, that in your
Lord&s;hip's Opinion, Chri&s;t is not God: For if
you believ'd him, in a true and proper Sen&s;e,
God, how could you exclude him from the
Power of forgiving Sins, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> God alone can
forgive Sins? It is incon&s;i&s;tent with Sen&s;e and
Rea&s;on to deny this Power to Chri&s;t becau&s;e it
is a Divine Power, bat only becau&s;e you believe
him not to be a Divine Per&s;on. If Chri&s;t was
God, then he might forgive Sins, tho' God alone
can forgive Sins: But you &s;ay, Chri&s;t cannot
forgive Sins, becau&s;e God <HI>alone</HI> can forgive Sins;
therefore it is plain, that according to your
Lord&s;hip's Doctrine, Chri&s;t is not truly, or in a
proper Sen&s;e, God.</P>
<P>Here, my Lord, I de&s;ire again to appeal to
the <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> of your Laity; let them judge
betwixt the Scriptures and your Lord&s;hip. The
Scriptures plainly and frequently a&s;cribe all Di|vine
Attributes to Chri&s;t: They make him the
Creatour and Governour of the World; God
over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever. Yet your Lord&s;hip
<PB N="68" REF="70">
makes him a Creature, and denies him <HI>&s;uch</HI> a
Power, becau&s;e it belongs only to God.</P>
<P>You your &s;elf, my Lord, have allow'd him to be
ab&s;olute Ruler over the Con&s;ciences of Men; to
be an arbitrary Di&s;pen&s;er of the Means of Salva|tion
to Mankind; than which Powers, none can
be more Divine: And yet you hold, that he can|not
forgive Sins, becau&s;e Pardon of Sin can only
be the Effect of a Divine Power.</P>
<P>Is it not equally a Divine Power, (even ac|cording
to your Lord&s;hip) to rule over the Con|&s;ciences
of Men, to give Laws of Salvation, and
to act in the&s;e Affairs with an uncontroulable
Power, as <HI>to forgive Sins?</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, let their Common Sen&s;e here di&s;|cover
the Ab&s;urdity (for I mu&s;t call it &s;o) of your
<HI>New Scheme</HI> of Government in Chri&s;t's Kingdom.
Chri&s;t is <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Lord of it, (according to your
&s;elf) and can make or unmake Laws relating to
it; can di&s;pen&s;e or withold Grace as he plea&s;es
in this Spiritual Kingdom, all which Powers are
purely Divine, yet you &s;ay he cannot forgive
Sins, tho' every expre&s;s Power which you have
allow'd him over the Con&s;ciences of Men, be as
truly a <HI>Divine Power</HI> as that of <HI>forgiving Sins.</HI> Has
not Chri&s;t a proper and per&s;onal Power to give
Grace to his Subjects? Is he not Lord over their
Con&s;ciences? And are not the&s;e Powers as truly
appropriated to God? And has not your Lord|&s;hip
often taught them to be &s;o, as that of <HI>For|givene&s;s
of Sins?</HI> Is it not as much the Prerogative
<PB N="69" REF="71">
of God to have any natural intrin&s;ick Power, to
confer Grace, or any Spiritual Benefit to the Souls
of Men, as to forgive Sins? Has not your Lord|&s;hip
de&s;pis'd all the Admini&s;trations of the Cler|gy,
becau&s;e God's Graces can only come from
him&s;elf, and are only to be receiv'd from his own
Hands? The Conclu&s;ion therefore is this, either
Chri&s;t has a Per&s;onal intrin&s;ick Power to confer
Grace in his Kingdom, or he has not; if you &s;ay
he has not, then you are chargable with the
Collu&s;ion of making him a King in a Spiritual
Kingdom, where you allow him no Spiritual
Power: If you &s;ay he has, then you fall into this
Contradiction, that you allow him to have Di|vine
Powers, tho' he cannot have Divine Pow|ers;
that is, you allow him to <HI>give Grace,</HI> tho' it
is a Divine Power, and not to <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> be|cau&s;e
it is a Divine Power. My Lord, I wi&s;h
your Laity (if there be any to whom you can
render it intelligible) much Joy of &s;uch profound
Divinity. Or if there are others who are more
taken with your Lord&s;hip's Sincerity, I de&s;ire
them not to pa&s;s by this following remarkable In|&s;tance
of it: Your Lord&s;hip has here as plainly
declar'd, as Words can con&s;equentially declare
any thing, that you do not believe Chri&s;t to be
God, yet profe&s;s your &s;elf Bi&s;hop of a Church,
whof&s;e Liturgy in &s;o many repeated Te&s;timonies
declares the contrary Doctrine, and which obli|ges
you to expre&s;s your A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent to
&s;uch Doctrine. My Lord, I here call upon your
<HI>Sincerity,</HI> either Declare Chri&s;t to be Perfect God,
and then &s;hew why he could not <HI>forgive Sins,</HI> or
Deny him to be Perfect God, and then &s;hew how
<PB N="70" REF="72">
you can &s;incerely declare your <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent</HI>
to the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This, my Lord, has an Appearance of Preva|rication,
which you cannot, I hope, charge upon
any of your Adver&s;aries; who if they cannot think,
that to be &s;incere is the only thing nece&s;&s;ary to re|commend
Men to the Favour of God, yet may
have as much, or po&s;&s;ibly more Sincerity, than
tho&s;e who do think &s;o.</P>
<P>Before I take leave of your Lord&s;hip, I mu&s;t take
Notice of a <HI>Re&s;ting-Place,</HI> a <HI>&s;trong Retreat a la&s;ting
Foundation,</HI> i. e. <HI>a Demon&s;tration in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of</HI>
the Words, that all <HI>Church-Communion</HI> is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip &s;ets it out in the&s;e Words.</P>
<Q><P>I am not now going to accu&s;e you of a Here&s;ie again&s;t
Charity, but of a Here&s;ie again&s;t the Po&s;&s;ibility and Na|ture
of Things. <HI>As thus,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nel&s;on</HI> (for In&s;tance)
thinks him&s;elf oblig'd in Con&s;cience to Communicate
with &s;ome of our Church. Upon this you declare he
hath no Title to God's Mercy; and you and all the World
allow, that if he communicates with you whil&s;t his Con|&s;cience
tells him it is a Sin, he is &s;elf-condemn'd and out
o&s; God's Favour. That Notion, (viz. <HI>the Nece&s;&s;ity
of Church-Communion</HI>) therefore, which implies
this great invincible Ab&s;urdity, cannot be true.</P></Q>
<P>Pray, my Lord, what is this wond'rous Curi|o&s;ity
of a <HI>Demon&s;tration,</HI> but the common Ca&s;e
of an <HI>erroneous Con&s;cience?</HI> Did the &s;tricte&s;t Con|tenders
for Church-Communion ever teach, <HI>that
<PB N="71" REF="73">
any Terms</HI> are to be comply'd with again&s;t Con|&s;cience?
But its a &s;trange Conclu&s;ion to infer
from thence, that there is no Obligation to
Communion, or that all Things are to be held
indifferent, becau&s;e they are not to be comply'd
with again&s;t one's Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The Truths of the Chri&s;tian Religion have the
&s;ame Nature and Obligation, whatever our Opini|ons
are of them, and tho&s;e that are nece&s;&s;ary
to be believed, continue &s;o, whither we can
per&s;wade our &s;elves to believe them or not. I
&s;uppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip will not &s;ay, that the Ar|ticles
of Faith and nece&s;&s;ary In&s;titutions of the
Chri&s;tian Religion, are no otherways nece&s;&s;ary,
than becau&s;e we believe them to be &s;o, that our
Per&s;wa&s;ion is the only Cau&s;e of the Nece&s;&s;ity; but
if their Nece&s;&s;ity be not owing merely to our
belief of them, then it is certain that our Di&s;|belief
of them, cannot make them le&s;s nece&s;&s;a|ry.
If the Ordinances of Chri&s;t, and the Ar|ticles
of Faith are nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e Chri&s;t has
made them &s;o, that Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t continue the
&s;ame, whether we believe and ob&s;erve them or
not.</P>
<P>So that, my Lord, we may &s;till maintain the
nece&s;&s;ity of Church-Communion, and the &s;trict
ob&s;ervance of Chri&s;t's Ordinances, notwith|&s;tanding
that People have different per&s;wa&s;ions
in the&s;e Matters, pre&s;uming <HI>that our Opinions</HI> can
no more alter the nature or nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's
In&s;titutions, than we can believe <HI>Error</HI> into <HI>Truth,
Good</HI> into <HI>Evil,</HI> or <HI>Light</HI> into <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI> I &s;hall
<PB N="72" REF="74">
think my &s;elf no <HI>Heretick again&s;t the Nature of
Things,</HI> tho' I tell a <HI>Con&s;cientious Socinian,</HI> that the
Divinity of Chri&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary to be believed,
or a <HI>Con&s;cientious Jew,</HI> that it is nece&s;&s;ary to be
a Chri&s;tian in order to be &s;aved. But if your
Lord&s;hips Demon&s;tration was accepted, we
&s;hould be oblig'd to give up the nece&s;&s;ity of
every Doctrine and In&s;titution, to every Di&s;|believer
that pretended Con&s;cience. We mu&s;t
not tell any Party of People, that they are in
any danger for being out of Communion with
us, if they do but follow their own Per&s;wa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's <HI>Invincible Demon&s;tration</HI> pro|ceeds
thus.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not in&s;i&s;t upon the Nece&s;&s;ity of joyning with
any particular Church, becau&s;e then Con&s;cientious Per|&s;ons
will be in Danger either way; for if there be a
Nece&s;&s;ity of it, then there is a Danger if they do not
joyn with it, and if they comply again&s;t their Con&s;ci|ences,
the Danger is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What an inextricable Difficulty is here! How
&s;hall Divinity or Logick be able to relieve us!</P>
<P>Be pleas'd my Lord, to accept of this Solu|tion
in lieu of your Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e the Ca&s;e of a <HI>Con&s;cientious Jew;</HI>
I tell him that Chri&s;tianity is the only covenan|ted
Method of Salvation, and that he can have
no Title to the Favour of God, 'till he profe&s;&s;es
<PB N="73" REF="75">
the Faith of Chri&s;t. What, replies he, would
you direct me to do? If I embrace Chri&s;tianity
again&s;t my Con&s;cience, I am out of God's Fa|vour,
and if I follow my Con&s;cience, and con|tinue
a <HI>Jew,</HI> I am al&s;o out of his Favour. The
An&s;wer is this, my Lord; The <HI>Jew</HI> is to obey
his Con&s;cience, and to be left to the <HI>uncovenan|ted,
unpromi&s;ed</HI> Terms of God's <HI>Mercy,</HI> whil&s;t the
Con&s;cientious Chri&s;tian is entitled to the <HI>expre&s;s
and promi&s;ed favours of</HI> God.</P>
<P>There is &s;till the &s;ame ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of
believing in Chri&s;t, Chri&s;tianity is &s;till the only
Method of Salvation; tho' the &s;incere <HI>Jew</HI> can|not
&s;o per&s;wade him&s;elf; and we ought to de|clare
it to all <HI>Jews</HI> and Unbelievers what&s;oever,
that they can only be &s;av'd by embracing Chri&s;ti|anity.
That a fal&s;e Religion, does not become
a true one; nor a true one fal&s;e, in Con&s;e|quence
of their Opinions; but that if they are
&s;o unhappy, as to refu&s;e the Covenant of Grace,
they mu&s;t be left to &s;uch <HI>Mercy</HI> as is without any
Covenant. And now, my Lord, what is be|come
of this mighty Demon&s;tration? Does it
prove that Chri&s;tianity is not nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e
the Con&s;cientious <HI>Jew</HI> may think it is not &s;o?
It may as well prove, that the Moon is no larger
than a Man's Head, becau&s;e an hone&s;t ignorant
Countryman may think it no larger.</P>
<P>Is there any Per&s;on of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> who
would think it a Demon&s;tration, that he is not
obliged to go to Church, becau&s;e a <HI>Con&s;cienti|ous</HI>
Di&s;&s;enter will not? Could he think it le&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="76">
nece&s;&s;ary to be a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e a <HI>&s;incere Jew</HI>
cannot embrace Chri&s;tianity? Could he take it
to be an indifferent Matter, whether he believed
the Divinity of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e a <HI>Con&s;cientious
Socinian</HI> cannot? Yet this is your Lord&s;hip's <HI>in|vincible
Demon&s;tration,</HI> that we ought not to
in&s;i&s;t upon the nece&s;&s;ity of Church-Commu|nion,
becau&s;e a <HI>Con&s;cientious Disbeliever</HI> cannot
comply with it.</P>
<P>A &s;mall Degree of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> would teach
a Man that true Religion, and the Terms of
Salvation mu&s;t have the &s;ame obligatory Force,
whether we rea&s;on rightly about them or not;
and that they who believe and practice accor|ding
to them, are in expre&s;s Covenant with
God, which entitles them to his Favour; whil&s;t
tho&s;e who are &s;incerely Erronious, have nothing
but the &s;incerity of their Errors to plead, and
are left to &s;uch Mercy of God, as is without any
Promi&s;e. Here, my Lord, is nothing frightful
or ab&s;urd in this Doctrine, they who are in the
Church which Chri&s;t has founded, are upon
Terms which entitles them to God's Favour;
they who are out of it, fall to his Mercy.</P>
<P>But your Lord&s;hip is not content with the
Terms of the Go&s;pel, or a Doctrine that only
&s;aves a particular Sort of People; this is a nar|row
View, not wide enough for your Notions
of <HI>Liberty.</HI> Particular Religions, and particular
Covenants, are <HI>demon&s;trated</HI> to be ab&s;urd, <HI>becau&s;e</HI>
particular Per&s;ons may Di&s;-believe, or not &s;ub|mit
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t have Doctrines that will
&s;ave all People alike, in every way that their
Per&s;wa&s;ion leads them to take: But, my Lord,
there needs be no greater Demon&s;tration again&s;t
your Lord&s;hip's Doctrine, than that it equally fa|vours
every way of Wor&s;hip; for an Argument
which equally proves every Thing, has been ge|nerally
thought to prove nothing; which hap|pens
to be the Ca&s;e of your Lord&s;hip's <HI>Impor|tant
Demon&s;tration.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip indeed only in&s;tances in a par|ticular
Per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Nel&s;on;</HI> but your <HI>Demon&s;trati|on</HI>
is as &s;erviceable to any other Per&s;on who has
left any other Church whatever. The <HI>Con&s;cien|tious
Quaker, Muggletonian, Independant,</HI> or <HI>Socini|an,</HI>
&amp;c. have the &s;ame right to obey Con&s;cience,
and blame any Church that a&s;&s;umes a Power of
cen&s;uring them, as Mr. <HI>Nel&s;on</HI> had; and if they
are cen&s;ur'd by any Church, that Church is

Things,</HI> as that Church which cen&s;ur'd Mr. <HI>Nel|&s;on,</HI>
or any Church that &s;hould pretend to cen|&s;ure
any other Per&s;on whatever.</P>
<P>I am not at all Surpriz'd, that your Lord&s;hip
&s;hould teach this Doctrine, but its &s;omething
&s;trange, that &s;uch an Argument &s;hould be ob|truded
upon the World as an unheard of <HI>De|mon&s;tration,</HI>
and that in an <HI>Appeal to common Sen&s;e.</HI>
Suppo&s;e &s;ome Body or other in defence of your
Lord&s;hip, &s;hould take upon him to demon&s;trate
to the World, that there is no &s;uch Thing as
<PB N="76" REF="78">
Colour, becau&s;e there are &s;ome People that
can't &s;ee it; or Sounds, becau&s;e there are &s;ome
who don't hear them; He would have found out
the only <HI>Demon&s;trations</HI> in the World that could
equal your Lord&s;hips, and would have as much
rea&s;on to call tho&s;e <HI>Hereticks again&s;t the Nature of

upon the reality of Sounds, as your Lord&s;hip has
to call your Adver&s;aries &s;o.</P>
<P>For, is there no nece&s;&s;ity of Church-Commu|nion,
becau&s;e there are &s;ome who don't con|ceive
it? Then there are no Sounds, becau&s;e
there are &s;ome who don't hear them; for it is

<P>Some People have only taught us the <HI>innocency
of Error,</HI> and been content with &s;etting forth its
harmle&s;s Qualities; but your Lord&s;hip has been
a more hearty Advocate, and given it a <HI>Power</HI>
over every Truth and In&s;titution of Chri&s;tiani|ty.
If we have but an <HI>erronious Con&s;cience,</HI> the
whole Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation is cancell'd; all
the Truth and Doctrines in the Bible are <HI>De|mon&s;trated</HI>
to be unnece&s;&s;ary, if we do not be|lieve
them.</P>
<P>How unhappily have the &s;everal Parties of
Chri&s;tians been di&s;puting for many Ages, who
if they could but have found out this <HI>intelligible
Demon&s;tration,</HI> (from the Ca&s;e of an erroneous
Con&s;cience) would have &s;een the ab&s;urdity of
pretending to nece&s;&s;ary Doctrines, and in&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="77" REF="79">
upon <HI>Church-Communion;</HI> but it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
your Lord&s;hip's <HI>new invented Engine</HI> for
the De&s;truction of <HI>Churches;</HI> and it may be expect|ed
the <HI>good Chri&s;tians of no Church</HI> will return your
Lord&s;hip their Thanks for it.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip has thought it a mighty Ob|jection
to &s;ome Doctrines in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
that the Papi&s;ts might make &s;ome Advan|tage
of them: But yet your own Doctrine de|fends
<HI>all</HI> Communions alike, and &s;erves the <HI>Jew</HI>
and <HI>Socinian, &amp;c.</HI> as much as any other &s;ort of
People. Tho' this &s;ufficiently appears, from
what has been already &s;aid, yet that it may be
&s;till more obvious to the <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> of every
one, I &s;hall reduce the&s;e Doctrines to Practice,
and &s;uppo&s;e for once, that your Lord&s;hip intends
to convert a Jew, a Quaker, or Socinian.</P>
<P>Now in order to make a Convert of any of
them, the&s;e Preliminary PROPOSITIONS
are to be fir&s;t laid down according to your Lord|&s;hip's
Doctrine.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> for the Improvement of true
Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> I. That we are neither more or le&s;s
in the Favour of God, for living in any parti|cular
Method or Way of Wor&s;hip, but purely as
we are &s;incere. <HI>Pre&s;erv.</HI> page 90.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> II. That no Church ought to unchurch
another, or declare it out of God's Favour.
<HI>Pre&s;erv.</HI> p. 85.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">
<HI>Propo&s;.</HI> III. That nothing lo&s;es us the Favour
of God, but a wicked In&s;incerity. <HI>Ibid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> IV. That a con&s;cientious Per&s;on can
be in no Danger for being out of any particular
Church. <HI>Pre&s;erv.</HI> page 90.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> V. That there is no &s;uch Thing as any
real Perfection or Excellency in any Religion,
that can <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> our adhering to it, but that all is
founded in our Per&s;onal Per&s;ua&s;ion. Which your
Lord&s;hip thus proves, <HI>When we left the Popi&s;h Do|ctrines,
was it becau&s;e they were</HI> actually <HI>corrupt?</HI>
No; <HI>The Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e we thought them &s;o.</HI>
Therefore if we might leave the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI>
not becau&s;e her Doctrines were corrupt, but be|cau&s;e
we thought them &s;o, then the &s;ame Rea|&s;on
will ju&s;tify any one el&s;e, in leaving any
Church, how true &s;oever its Doctrines are; and
con&s;equently there is no &s;uch Thing, as any <HI>real</HI>
Perfection or Excellency in any Religion con|&s;ider'd
in it &s;elf, but it is <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI> according
to our Per&s;wa&s;ions about it. <HI>Pre&s;erv.</HI> page 85.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> VI. That Chri&s;t is <HI>&s;ole</HI> King and <HI>Law|giver</HI>
in his Kingdom, that no <HI>Men</HI> have any
Power of Legi&s;lation in it; that if we would be
good Members of it, we mu&s;t &s;hew our &s;elves
Subjects of Chri&s;t alone, without any Regard to
Man's Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> VII. That as Chri&s;t's Kingdom is not
of this World, &s;o when Worldly Encouragements
<PB N="79" REF="81">
are annexed to it, the&s;e are &s;o many Divi&s;ions
again&s;t Chri&s;t and his own expre&s;s Word. <HI>Serm.</HI>
page 11.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> VIII. That to pretend to know the
Hearts and Sincerity of Men, is Non&s;en&s;e and
Ab&s;urdity. <HI>Serm.</HI> page 93.</P>
<P><HI>Propo&s;.</HI> IX. That God's Graces are only to be
receiv'd immediately from him&s;elf. <HI>Serm,</HI> p. 89.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my Lord, are your Lord&s;hips own Pro|po&s;itions,
expre&s;&s;ed in your own Terms without
any Exaggeration.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, begin as &s;oon as you
plea&s;e, either with a <HI>Quaker, Socinian,</HI> or <HI>Jew;</HI>
u&s;e any Argument what&s;oever to convert them,
and you &s;hall have a &s;ufficient An&s;wer from your
own Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Will you tell the <HI>Jew</HI> that Chri&s;tianity is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to Salvation? <HI>He will an&s;wer from</HI>
Propo&s;. I. That we are neither more or le&s;as in the Fa|vour
of God, for living in any particular Method or
way of Wor&s;hip, but purely as we are Sincere.</P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip tell him, that the Truth of
Chri&s;tianity is &s;o well a&s;&s;erted, that there is no
Excu&s;e left for Unbelievers? He will an&s;wer
from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> V. <HI>That all Religion is founded in per|&s;onal
Per&s;ua&s;ion; that as your Lord&s;hip does not believe
that Chri&s;t is come, becau&s;e he is actually come, but
<PB N="80" REF="82">
becau&s;e you think he is come; &s;o He does not disbelieve
Chri&s;t becau&s;e he is not actually come, but becau&s;e he
thinks he is not come.</HI> So that here, my Lord, the
<HI>Jew</HI> gives as good a rea&s;on why he is not a Chri|&s;tian,
as your Lord&s;hip does why you are not a
Papi&s;t.</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip &s;hould turn the Di&s;cour&s;e to
a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and offer him any Rea&s;ons for Em|bracing
the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI>
you can't po&s;&s;ibly have any better Succe&s;s;
any one may &s;ee from your <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> that no
Argument can be urg'd but what your Lord&s;hip
has there fully an&s;wered. For &s;ince you allow
nothing to the <HI>Truth</HI> of Doctrines, or the <HI>Ex|cellency</HI>
of any Communion as &s;uch, it is de|mon&s;trable
that no Church or Communion can
have any Advantage above another, which is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to per&s;uade any
&s;en&s;ible Man to exchange any Communion for
another.</P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip tell a <HI>Quaker</HI> that there is
any Danger in that particular Way that he is in?</P>
<P>He can an&s;wer from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> l&s;t, 3d, and 4th.
<HI>That a Con&s;cientious Per&s;on can't be in any Danger for
being out of any particular Church.</HI></P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip tell him that his Religion is
condemned by the Univer&s;al Church?</P>
<P>He can an&s;wer from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> 2d, <HI>That no Church
ought to unchurch another, or declare it out of God's
Favour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
Will you tell him that Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted
Sacraments as <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Means</HI> of Grace, which he
neglects to Ob&s;erve?</P>
<P>He will an&s;wer you from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> IX. <HI>That God's
Graces are only to be received</HI> immediately from him|&s;elf.
And to think that <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> or the
&s;prinkling of Water is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, is
as ab&s;urd, as to think any Order of the Clergy,
is nece&s;&s;ary to recommend us to God.</P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip tell him that he di&s;plea&s;es
God, by not holding &s;everal Articles of Faith,
which Chri&s;t has required us to believe?</P>
<P>He can reply from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> III. <HI>That nothing
lo&s;es us the Favour of God</HI> but a <HI>wicked In&s;incerity.</HI>
And from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> V. That as your Lord&s;hip be|lieves
&s;uch Things, not becau&s;e they are actually
to be believ'd, but becau&s;e you think &s;o; &s;o he
disbelieves them, not becau&s;e they are actually
fal&s;e, but becau&s;e he thinks &s;o.</P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip tell him he is in&s;incere?</P>
<P>He can reply from <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> VI. <HI>That to a&s;&s;ume to

the Nece&s;&s;ity of Church-Communion, or the

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope your Lord&s;hip will not think it Unna|tural
or Impertinent, to offer here a word
or two in an&s;wer to &s;ome Objections again&s;t my
former Letter.</P>
<P>To begin with the Doctrine of the uninter|rupted
Succe&s;&s;ion of the Clergy.</P>
<P>I have, as I think, prov'd that there is a Di|vine
Sommi&s;&s;ion requir'd to qualifie any one to
exerci&s;e the Prie&s;tly Office, and that &s;eeing this
Divine Commi&s;&s;ion can only be had from &s;uch
particular Per&s;ons as God has appointed to give
it, therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be
a continual Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Per&s;ons, in or|der
to keep up a Commi&s;&s;ion'd Order of the
Clergy. For if the Commi&s;&s;ion it &s;elf be to
de&s;cend thro' Ages; and di&s;tingui&s;h the Clergy
from the Laity; it is certain the Per&s;ons who
alone can give this Commi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t de&s;cend
thro' the &s;ame Ages, and Con&s;equently an un|interrupted
Succe&s;&s;ion is as nece&s;&s;ary, as that
the Clergy have a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion. Take
away this Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Clergy may as
well be Ordain'd by one Per&s;on as another; a
Number of Women may as well give them a
Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, as a Congregation of any
Men, they may indeed appoint Per&s;ons to Offi|ciate
in Holy Orders, for the &s;ake of <HI>Decency</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="89">
and <HI>Order;</HI> but then there is no more in it, than
an external <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> they are no more
the Prie&s;ts of <HI>God,</HI> then tho&s;e that pretended
to make them &s;o. If we had lo&s;t the Scrip|tures,
it would be very well to make as good
Books as we could, and come as near them as
po&s;&s;ible; but then it would be not only Folly,
but Pre&s;umption, to call them the Word of
God. But I proceed to the Objections again&s;t
the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is &s;aid, that there is no mention made
of it in Scripture, as having any relation to the
being of a Church.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is &s;ubject to &s;o great Uncer|tainty,
that if it be nece&s;&s;ary, we can't now be
&s;ure we are in the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That it is a Popi&s;h Doctrine, and gives
them great Advantage over us.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>1&s;t</HI> Objection, that there
is no mention made of it in the Scriptures,
which tho' I think 1 have &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd in
this Letter, I &s;hall here farther con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, is it not a true Doctrine, that
<HI>the Scriptures contain all things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation?</HI>
But, my Lord, it is no where expre&s;ly &s;aid, that
<HI>the Scriptures contain all things nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</HI>
It is no where &s;aid, that no other Articles of Faith
need be believed. Where does it appear in Scri|pture,
that the Scriptures were writ by any Di|vine
<PB N="88" REF="90">
Command? Have any of the Go&s;pels or
Epi&s;tles this Authority to recommend them?
Are they nece&s;&s;ary to be believ'd, becau&s;e there
is any Law of Chri&s;t concerning the Nece&s;&s;ity of
believing them?</P>
<P>May I reject this uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion,
becau&s;e it is not mention'd in Scripture? And
may I not as well reject all the Go&s;pels? Pro|duce
your Authority, my Lord, mention your
Texts of Scripture, where Chri&s;t has <HI>hung the
Salvation of Men</HI> upon their believing, that
St. <HI>Matthew</HI> or St. <HI>John</HI> wrote &s;uch a Book &s;even|teen
Hundred Years ago. The&s;e, my Lord, are
<HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles</HI> which are not to be found in
Scripture, and con&s;equently have nothing to do
with the Salvation of Men.</P>
<P>Now if nothing be to be held as nece&s;&s;ary, but
what is expre&s;ly required in &s;o many Words in Scri|pture,
then it can never be prov'd that the Scri|ptures
them&s;elves are a <HI>&s;tanding Rule of Faith in all
Ages,</HI> &s;ince it is no where expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, nor
is it any where &s;aid, that the Scriptures &s;hould
be continued as a Rule of Faith in all Ages. Is
it an Objection again&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity of a perpe|tual
Succe&s;&s;ion of the Clergy, that it is not men|tion'd
in the Scripture? And is it not as good
a one again&s;t the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of making Scripture the
<HI>&s;tanding Rule of Faith in all Ages,</HI> &s;ince it is never
&s;aid, that they were to be continu'd as a &s;tanding
Rule in all Ages? If things are only nece&s;&s;ary
for being &s;aid to be &s;o in Scripture, then all that
are not thus taught are equally unnece&s;&s;ary, and
<PB N="89" REF="91">
con&s;equently it is no more nece&s;&s;ary that the
Scripture &s;hould be a fix'd Rule of Faith in all
Ages, than that there &s;hould be Bi&s;hops to ordain
in all Ages.</P>
<P>Again, where &s;hall we find it in Scripture, that
the Sacraments are to be continued in every Age
of the Church? Where is it &s;aid, that they &s;hall
always be the ordinary Means of Grace nece&s;&s;ary
to be ob&s;erv'd? Is there any Law of Chri&s;t, any
Text of Scripture, that expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that if
we leave the U&s;e of the Sacraments, we are out
of Covenant with God? Is it any where di|rectly
&s;aid, that we mu&s;t never lay them a&s;ide,
or that they will be <HI>perpetually</HI> nece&s;&s;ary? No,
my Lord, this is a <HI>Nicety</HI> and <HI>Trifle</HI> not to be <HI>found
in Scripture: There is no Stre&s;s laid there upon this
Matter,</HI> but upon things <HI>of a quite different: Na|ture.</HI></P>
<P>I now pre&s;ume, my Lord, that every one who
has common Sen&s;e plainly &s;ees, that if this Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the Clergy be to be de&s;pis'd, becau&s;e
it is not expre&s;ly requir'd in Scripture; it unde|niably
follows, that we may reject the Scriptures,
as not being a <HI>&s;tanding Rule of Faith in all Ages;</HI> we
way di&s;u&s;e the Sacraments, as not the <HI>Ordinary
Means of Grace in all Ages;</HI> &s;ince this is no more
mentioned in the Scriptures, or <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> requir'd,
than this uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If it be a good Argument again&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity
of Episcopal Ordainers, that it is never &s;aid in
Scripture, that there &s;hall <HI>always</HI> be &s;uch Ordainers;
<PB N="90" REF="92">
it is certainly as conclu&s;ive again&s;t the U&s;e
of the Sacraments in every Age, that it is no
where &s;aid in Scripture they &s;hall be u&s;ed in
<HI>All Ages.</HI></P>
<P>If no Government or Order of the Clergy be
to be held as nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e no &s;uch Nece&s;|&s;ity
is a&s;&s;erted in Scripture; it is certain this con|cludes
as &s;trongly again&s;t <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>the
Order it &s;elf,</HI> as again&s;t any <HI>Particular</HI> Order. For
it is no more &s;aid in Scripture, that there &s;hall be
an Order of Clergy, than that there &s;hall be any
<HI>particular</HI> Order; therefore if this Silence proves
again&s;t any <HI>particular</HI> Order of Clergy, it proves
as much again&s;t <HI>Order it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Should therefore any of your Lord&s;hip's
Friends have &s;o much Church-Zeal as to con|tend
for the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;ome Order,</HI> tho' of no
particular Order; he mu&s;t fall under your Lord|&s;hip's
Di&s;plea&s;ure, and be prov'd as meer a
<HI>Dreamer</HI> and <HI>Trifler,</HI> as tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the Nece&s;|&s;ity
of Epi&s;copal Ordination. For if it be plain,
that there need be no <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy,</HI> becau&s;e it
is not &s;aid there &s;hall <HI>always</HI> be Epi&s;copal Clergy;
it is undeniably plain, that there need be <HI>no Order</HI>
of the Clergy, &s;ince it is no where &s;aid, there
&s;hall be <HI>an Order</HI> of Clergy: Therefore whoever
&s;hall contend for an Order of Clergy, will be as
much condemn'd by your Lord&s;hip's Doctrine,
as he that declares for the Epi&s;copal Clergy.</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is this, If nothing is
to be e&s;teemed of any Moment, but counted as
<PB N="91" REF="93">
mere <HI>Trifle</HI> and <HI>Nicety</HI> among Chri&s;tians, which
is not <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> requir'd in the Scriptures; then it
is a <HI>Trifle</HI> and <HI>Nicety,</HI> whether we believe the
Scripture to be a <HI>&s;tanding Rule of Faith</HI> in all Ages,
whether we u&s;e the Sacraments in <HI>all Ages,</HI> whe|ther
we have any Clergy at all, whether we ob|&s;erve
the Lord's Day, whether we baptize our
Children, or whether we go to publick Wor&s;hip;
for none of the&s;e things are expre&s;ly required in
&s;o many Words in Scripture. But if your Lord&s;hip,
with the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian World, will take
the&s;e things to be of Moment, and well prov'd,
becau&s;e they are founded in Scripture, tho' not
in <HI>expre&s;s Terms,</HI> or under <HI>plain Commands;</HI> if you
will acknowledge the&s;e Matters to be well a&s;&s;ert|ed,
becau&s;e they may be gather'd from Scripture,
and are confirm'd by the univer&s;al Practice of the
Church in all Ages, (which is all the Proof that
they are capable of) I don't doubt but it will
appear, that this <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive Order of the Clergy</HI> is
founded on the &s;ame Evidence, and &s;upported
by as great Authority, &s;o that it mu&s;t be thought
of the &s;ame Moment with the&s;e things, by all
unprejudic'd Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>For, my Lord, tho' it be not expre&s;ly &s;aid, that
there &s;hall <HI>always</HI> be a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion of Epi&s;copal Clergy,</HI>
yet it is a Truth founded in Scripture it &s;elf, and
a&s;&s;erted by the univer&s;al Voice of Tradition in
the fir&s;t and &s;ucceeding Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>It is thus founded in Scripture: There we are
taught that, the Prie&s;thood is a <HI>Po&s;itive In&s;titution;</HI>
that no Man can take this Office unto him&s;elf;
<PB N="92" REF="94">
that neither our Saviour him&s;elf, nor his Apo&s;tles,
nor any other Per&s;on, however extraordinarily en|dow'd
with Gifts from God, could, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> exer|ci&s;e
the Prie&s;tly Office, till they had God's ex|pre&s;s
Commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. Now how
does it appear, that the Sacraments are Po&s;itive
In&s;titutions, but that they are con&s;ecrated to &s;uch
Ends and Effects, as of them&s;elves they were no
way qualify'd to perform? Now as it appears
from Scripture, that Men, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> however en|dow'd,
were not qualify'd to take this Office up|on
them without God's Appointment; it is de|mon&s;tratively
certain, that Men &s;o call'd are as
much to be e&s;teem'd a <HI>Po&s;itive In&s;titution,</HI> as Ele|ments
&s;o cho&s;en can be call'd a <HI>Po&s;itive In&s;titution.</HI>
All the Per&s;onal Abilities of Men conferring no
more Authority to exerci&s;e the Office of a
Clergy-Man, than the natural Qualities of Water
to make a Sacrament: So that the one In&s;titu|tion
is as truly Po&s;itive as the other.</P>
<P>Again. The Order of the Clergy is not only a
<HI>Po&s;itive</HI> Order in&s;tituted by God, but the diffe|rent
Degrees in this Order is of the &s;ame Nature.
For we find in Scripture, that &s;ome Per&s;ons could
perform &s;ome Offices in the Prie&s;thood, which
neither Deacons nor Prie&s;ts could do, tho' tho&s;e
Deacons and Prie&s;ts were in&s;pir'd Per&s;ons, and
Workers of Miracles. Thus <HI>Timothy</HI> was &s;ent to
ordain Elders, becau&s;e none below his Order,
who was a Bi&s;hop, could perform that Office.
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> laid their Hands on baptiz'd Per|&s;ons,
becau&s;e neither Prie&s;ts nor Deacons, tho'
<PB N="93" REF="95">
Workers of Miracles, could execute that Part of
the Sacerdotal Office.</P>
<P>Now can we imagine that the Apo&s;tles and
Bi&s;hops thus di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves for no|thing?
That there was the &s;ame Power in <HI>Dea|cons</HI>
and <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to execute tho&s;e Offices, tho' they
took them to them&s;elves? No, my Lord; if
three Degrees in the Mini&s;try are in&s;tituted in
Scripture, we are oblig'd to think them as truly
di&s;tinct in their Powers, as we are to think that
the Prie&s;thood it &s;elf contains Powers that are
di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the Laity. It is no more
con&s;i&s;tent with Scripture, to &s;ay that <HI>Deacons</HI> or
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> may ordain, than that the Laity are Prie&s;ts
or Deacons. The &s;ame Divine Institution mak|ing
as truly a Difference betwixt the Clergy, as
it does betwixt Clergy and Laity.</P>
<P>Now if the Order of the Clergy be a <HI>Divine
Po&s;itive</HI> In&s;titution, in which there are different
Degrees of Power, where &s;ome alone can Or|dain,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whil&s;t others can only perform other
parts of the &s;acred Office; if this (as it plainly
appears) be a Doctrine of Scripture, then it is a
Doctrine of Scripture, that there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion of Men as have Power to or|dain.
For do the Scriptures make it nece&s;&s;ary
that <HI>Timothy</HI> (or &s;ome Bi&s;hop) &s;hould be &s;ent to
<HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> to ordain Prie&s;ts, becau&s;e the Prie&s;ts who
were there could not ordain? And do not the
&s;ame Scriptures make it as nece&s;&s;ary, that <HI>Timo|thy</HI>'s
Succe&s;&s;or be the only Ordainer, as well as
He was in his Time? Will not Prie&s;ts in the
<PB N="94" REF="96">
next Age be as de&s;titute of the Power of Ordain|ing,
as when <HI>Timothy</HI> was alive? So that &s;ince
the Scriptures teach, that <HI>Timothy,</HI> or Per&s;ons of
his Order, could <HI>alone</HI> ordain in that Age; they
as plainly teach, that the Succe&s;&s;ors of that Or|der
can <HI>alone</HI> ordain in any Age, and con&s;e|quently
the Scriptures plainly teach a Nece&s;&s;ity
of an <HI>Epi&s;copal Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The Scriptures declare there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of
a Divine Commi&s;&s;ion to execute the Office of a
Prie&s;t; they al&s;o teach, that this Commi&s;&s;ion
can only be had from particular Per&s;ons: There|fore
the Scriptures plainly teach, there is a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Particular Per&s;ons,</HI> in
order to keep up a truly <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion'd Clergy.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e when <HI>Timothy</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> to
ordain Elders, the Church had told him, We
have cho&s;e Elders already, and laid our Hands
upon them: That if he alone was allowed to
exerci&s;e this Power, it might &s;eem as if he
alone had it; or that Ministers were the better
for being ordain'd by his particular Hands; and
that &s;ome Per&s;ons might imagine they could have
no Clergy, except they were ordain'd by him,
or &s;ome of his Order; and that &s;eeing Chri&s;t had
no where made an expre&s;s Law, that &s;uch Per|&s;ons
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to the Ordination of the
Clergy; therefore they rejected this Authority
of <HI>Timothy,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ubject them&s;elves to
<HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">
Will your Lord&s;hip &s;ay, that &s;uch a Practice
would have been allow'd of in the <HI>Ephe&s;ians?</HI>
Or that Mini&s;ters &s;o ordained, would have been
receiv'd as the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t? If not, why
mu&s;t &s;uch Practice or &s;uch Mini&s;ters be allow'd of

again&s;t any of <HI>Timothy's Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> have de|&s;erv'd
the &s;ame Cen&s;ure, as being equally un|lawful.
If therefore the Scripture condemns all
Ordination but what is Epi&s;copal; the Scriptures
make a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Epi&s;copal Ordainers</HI> nece&s;&s;ary.
So that I hope, my Lord, we &s;hall be no more
told that this is a Doctrine not mention'd in
Scripture, or without any Foundation in it.</P>
<P>The great Objection to this Doctrine is, that
this <HI>Epi&s;copal Order of the Clergy,</HI> is only an Apo|&s;tolical
Practice; and &s;eeing <HI>all</HI> Apo&s;tolical Pra|ctices
are not binding to us, &s;ure this need not.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, my Lord, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;hew,
that tho' all Apo&s;tolical Practices are not nece&s;|&s;ary,
yet &s;ome may be nece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
the Divine unalterable Right of Epi&s;copacy is
not founded <HI>merely</HI> on Apo&s;tolical Practice.</P>
<P>To begin with the <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> The Objection runs
thus, <HI>All Apo&s;tolical Practices, are not unalterable or
obligatory to us, therefore no Apo&s;tolical Practices are.</HI>
This, my Lord, is ju&s;t as Theological, as if I
&s;hould &s;ay all Scripture-Truths are not Articles
of Faith, or Fundamentals of Religion, therefore
no Scripture-Truths are: Is not the Argument
<PB N="96" REF="98">
full as ju&s;t and &s;olid in one Ca&s;e as the Other?
May there not be that &s;ame Difference between
&s;ome Practices of the Apo&s;tles and others, that
there is betwixt &s;ome Scripture-Truths and o|thers?
Are all Truths equally important that are
to be found in the Bible? Why mu&s;t all Practices
be of the &s;ame Moment that were Apo&s;tolical?
Now if there be any Way, either divine or hu|mane,
of knowing an Article of Faith, from the
&s;malle&s;t Truth or mo&s;t indifferent Matter in
Scripture, they will equally a&s;&s;i&s;t us in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
what Apo&s;tolical Practices are of perpetual
Obligation, and what are not. But it is a &s;trange
way of Rea&s;oning, that &s;ome People are fallen
into, who &s;eem to know nothing of <HI>Moderation,</HI>
but jump as con&s;tantly out of one Extream into
another, as if there was no &s;uch Thing as a middle
Way, or any &s;uch Virtue as <HI>Moderation.</HI> Thus
either the Church mu&s;t have an <HI>ab&s;olute uncontroul|able
Authority,</HI> or none at all; we mu&s;t either hold
<HI>all</HI> Apo&s;tolical Practices nece&s;&s;ary, or <HI>none at all.</HI></P>
<P>Again, if no Apo&s;tolical <HI>Practices</HI> can be unal|terable,
becau&s;e all are not, then no Apo&s;tolical
<HI>Doctrines</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary to be taught in all Ages,
becau&s;e all Apo&s;tolical <HI>Doctrines</HI> are not; and we
are no more oblig'd to teach the <HI>Death, Sati&s;|faction</HI>
and <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than we
are oblig'd to forbid the <HI>eating of Blood and Things
&s;trangled.</HI> If we mu&s;t thus blindly follow them
in all their Practices, or el&s;e be at liberty to leave
them in all, we mu&s;t for the &s;ame Rea&s;on im|plicitly
teach all their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> or el&s;e have a
Power of receding from them all.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
For if there be any Thing in the Nature of
<HI>Doctrines,</HI> in the <HI>Tenour</HI> of Scripture, or the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI>
of Antiquity, whereby we can know the diffe|rence

nece&s;&s;ary and important in all Ages and Condi|tions

to the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of every Thing which
the Apo&s;tles did, tho' it plainly appears, that it
was done upon <HI>accidental</HI> and <HI>mutable</HI> Rea&s;ons.
Can we not be oblig'd to ob&s;erve the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>
from Apo&s;tolical <HI>Practice,</HI> without being equally
oblig'd to <HI>Lock the Doors</HI> where we are met, be|cau&s;e
in the Apo&s;tles Times they lock'd them for
fear of their Enemies.</P>
<P>My Lord, we are to follow the <HI>Practices</HI> of
the Apo&s;tles, as we ought to follow every Thing
el&s;e, with <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and not run
<PB N="98" REF="100">
headlong into every Thing they did, becau&s;e
they were Apo&s;tles, or yet think that becau&s;e
we need not practi&s;e after them in every Thing,
we need do it in nothing. We be&s;t imitate
them, when we act upon &s;uch Rea&s;ons as they
acted upon, and neither make their <HI>Occa&s;ional</HI>
Practices <HI>perpetual</HI> Laws, nor break thro' &s;uch
General Rules, as will always have the <HI>&s;ame rea|&s;on</HI>
to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>If it be ask'd, how we can know what Pra|ctices
mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, and what may be laid
a&s;ide? I an&s;wer, as we know <HI>Articles</HI> of Faith
from <HI>le&s;&s;er Truths;</HI> as we know <HI>Occa&s;ional</HI> Do|ctrines
from Perpetual Doctrines, that is, from
the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things, from the <HI>Tenour</HI> of
Scripture, and the <HI>Te&s;timony of</HI> Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is not true, that the <HI>Divine unal|terable
Right</HI> of Epi&s;copacy is founded <HI>merely</HI> up|on
Apo&s;tolical Practice.</P>
<P>We do not &s;ay that Epi&s;copacy cannot be
changed, <HI>merely</HI> becau&s;e we have Apo&s;tolical
Practice for it; but becau&s;e &s;uch is the Nature of
the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;thood, that it can only be
continued in that Method, which God has ap|pointed
for its Continuance. Thus, Epi&s;copa|cy
is the <HI>only</HI> in&s;tituted Method of continuing
the Prie&s;thood; therefore Epi&s;copacy is <HI>unchange|able,</HI>
not becau&s;e it is an Apo&s;tolical Practice,
but becau&s;e the Nature of the Thing requires
it: A po&s;itive Institution being only to be con|tinued
<PB N="99" REF="101">
in that Method which God has appointed;
&s;o that it is the Nature of the Prie&s;thood, and
not the Apo&s;tolical Practice alone, that makes
it nece&s;&s;ary to be continued. The Apo&s;tolical
Practice indeed &s;hews, that Epi&s;copacy is the
Order that is appointed, but it is the Nature of
the Prie&s;thood that a&s;&s;ures us that it is <HI>Unaltera|ble:</HI>
And- that becau&s;e an Office which is of no
&s;ignificancy, but as it is of Divine Appoint|ment,
and in&s;tituted by God, can no otherways
be continued, but in that way of Continuance
which God has appointed.</P>
<P>The Argument proceeds thus; The Chri&s;tian
Prie&s;thood is a Divine po&s;itive In&s;titution, which
as it could only begin by the <HI>Divine Appointment,</HI>
&s;o it can only de&s;cend to after Ages in &s;uch a
Method, as God has been-plea&s;ed to appoint.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles (and your Lord&s;hip owns,
Chri&s;t was in <HI>all</HI> that they did)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Snape.</HI></NOTE> in&s;tituted Epi&s;co|pacy
<HI>alone,</HI> therefore this Method of Epi&s;copa|cy
is unalterable, not becau&s;e an <HI>Apo&s;tolical Practice</HI>
cannot be laid a&s;ide, but becau&s;e the Prie&s;thood
can only de&s;cend to after-Ages in &s;uch a Me|thod
as is of Divine Appointment.</P>
<P>So that the Que&s;tion is not fairly &s;tated, when
it is asked, whether Epi&s;copacy, being an Apo&s;to|lical
Practice, may be laid a&s;ide? But it &s;hould
be asked, whether an in&s;tituted particular Me|thod
of continuing the Prie&s;thood be not nece&s;|&s;ary
to be continued? Whether an appointed
<PB N="100" REF="102">
Order of receiving a Commi&s;&s;ion from God be
not nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erv'd, in order to receive
a Commi&s;&s;ion from Him? If the Ca&s;e was thus
&s;tated, as it ought to be fairly &s;tated, any one
would &s;oon perceive, that we can no more lay
a&s;ide Epi&s;copacy, and yet continue the Chri&s;tian
Prie&s;thood, than we can alter the Terms of Sal|vation,
and yet be in Covenant with God.</P>
<P><HI>I come now, my Lord, to the Second Ob|jection,</HI>
That this uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion is &s;ubject
to &s;o great uncertainty, that if it be nece&s;&s;ary, we can
never &s;ay that we are in the Church.</P>
<P>I know no Rea&s;on, my Lord, why it is &s;o
uncertain, but becau&s;e it is founded upon
<HI>Hi&s;torical Evidence.</HI> Let it therefore be con&s;ider|ed,
my Lord, that Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf, is a <HI>Mat|ter
of Fact,</HI> only convey'd to us by <HI>Hi&s;torical Evi|dence.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI> is only made known
to us by <HI>Hi&s;torical Evidence;</HI> that we have no
other way of knowing what Writings are the
word of God; and yet the Truth of our Faith, and
every other Means of Grace depends upon our
Knowledge and Belief of the Scriptures. Mu&s;t
we not declare the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Succe&s;&s;ion
of Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e it can only be prov'd by
<HI>Hi&s;torical Evidence,</HI> and that for &s;uch a long tract
of Time?</P>
<P>Why then do we declare the belief of the
Scriptures, nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation? Is not this
<PB N="101" REF="103">
equally putting the Salvation of Men upon a
<HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> &s;upported only by <HI>Hi&s;torical Evi|dence,</HI>
and making it depend upon Things done
&s;eventeen hundred Years ago? Cannot <HI>Hi&s;torical
Evidence</HI> &s;atisfie us in one Point, as well as in
the other? Is there any Thing in the Nature of
this Succe&s;&s;ion, that it can't be as well a&s;&s;erted
by <HI>Hi&s;torical Evidence,</HI> as the Truth of the Scrip|tures?
Is there not the &s;ame bare po&s;&s;ibility in the
Thing it &s;elf, that the Scriptures may in &s;ome
important Points be corrupted, as that this Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
may be broke? But is this any ju&s;t Rea|&s;on
why we &s;hould believe, or fear, that the Scri|ptures
are corrupted, becau&s;e there is a Phy|&s;ical
Po&s;&s;ibility of it, tho' there is all the Proof
that can be requir'd of the contrary? Why then
mu&s;t we &s;et a&s;ide the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Succe&s;&s;i|on
from a <HI>bare po&s;&s;ibility of</HI> Error, tho' there is all
the Proof that can be requir'd, that it never was
broken, but &s;trictly kept up?</P>
<P>And tho' your Lord&s;hip has told the World
&s;o much of the <HI>Improbability, Non&s;en&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Ab|&s;urdity</HI>
of this Succe&s;&s;ion, yet I prormi&s;e your
Lord&s;hip an An&s;wer when ever you &s;hall think
fit to &s;hew, <HI>when;</HI> or <HI>how,</HI> or <HI>where</HI> this Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
broke, or <HI>&s;eem'd</HI> to break, or was <HI>likely</HI>
to break.</P>
<P>And till then, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with
offering this Rea&s;on to your Lord&s;hip, why it is
<HI>morally impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> it ever &s;hould have broken in
all that Term of Years, from the Apo&s;tles to the
pre&s;ent Times.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">
The Rea&s;on is this; it has been a receiv'd Do|ctrine
in every Age of the Church, that no Or|dination
was valid but that of Bi&s;hops: This Do|ctrine,
my Lord, has been a con&s;tant Guard
upon the <HI>Epi&s;copal Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI> for &s;eeing it was uni|ver&s;ally
believ'd that Bi&s;hops <HI>alone</HI> could Ordain,
it was <HI>morally impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that any Per&s;ons could
be receiv'd as Bi&s;hops, who had not been &s;o
Ordain'd.</P>
<P>Now is it not <HI>morally impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that in our
Church any one &s;hould be made a Bi&s;hop with|out
<HI>Epi&s;copal Ordination?</HI> Is there any po&s;&s;ibility
of forging Orders, or &s;atealing a Bi&s;hoprick by
any other Stratagem? No, it is <HI>morally impo&s;&s;ible,</HI>
becau&s;e it is an acknowledg'd Doctrine among&s;t
us, that a Bi&s;hop can only be ordain'd by Bi|&s;hops?
Now as this Doctrine mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
prevent any one being a Bi&s;hop without <HI>Epi&s;copal
Ordination</HI> in our Age, &s;o it mu&s;t have the &s;ame
effect in every other Age as well as ours; and
con&s;equently it is as rea&s;onable to believe that
the Succe&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hiops was not broke in any
Age &s;ince the Apo&s;tles, as that it was not broke
in our own Kingdom within the&s;e forty Years.
For the &s;ame Doctrine which pre&s;erves it forty
Years, may as well pre&s;erve it forty hundred
Years, if it was equally believ'd in all that
&s;pace of Time. That this has been the con&s;tant
Doctrine of the Church, I pre&s;ume your Lord|&s;hip

that your Lord&s;hip has &s;et &s;incere <HI>Jews, Qua|kers,
Socinians, Muggletonians,</HI> and all <HI>Hereticks</HI> and
<HI>Schi&s;maticks</HI> upon the &s;ame Bottom, as to the Fa|vour
of God, with &s;incere Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Upon this, my Lord, I am called upon to
prove that the&s;e &s;everal Sorts of People can be
<HI>Sincere</HI> in your account of Sincerity. To which,
my Lord, I make this An&s;wer, either there are
&s;ome &s;incere Per&s;ons among&s;t <HI>Jews, Quakers,
Socinians,</HI> or any kind of <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Schi&s;maticks,</HI>
or there are not; if there are, your Lord&s;hip has
given them the &s;ame title to God's Favour, that
you have to the &s;incere&s;t Chri&s;tians, if you will &s;ay,
there are no &s;incere Per&s;ons among&s;t any of them,
then your Lord&s;hip Damns them all in the Gro&s;s,
<PB N="107" REF="109">
for &s;urely Corruptions in Religion, profe&s;s'd
with un&s;incerity, will never &s;ave People.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do to prove the Sincerity
of any of them, if they are Sincere, what I
have &s;aid is true, if you will not allow them to
be Sincere, you condemn them all at once.</P>
<P>Again, I humbly &s;uppos'd a Man might be
&s;incere in his <HI>Religious Opinions,</HI> tho' it might be
owing to <HI>&s;ome ill Habits,</HI> or <HI>&s;omething Criminal</HI> in
Him&s;elf, that he was fallen into &s;uch or &s;uch
a way of Thinking. Bus it &s;eems this is all <HI>Con|tradiction;</HI>
and no Man can be &s;incere, who has
<HI>any Faults,</HI> or who&s;e <HI>Faults</HI> have any <HI>Influence</HI> upon
his way of Thinking.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip tells all the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> that
they may be ea&s;ie, if they are &s;incere; and that it
is the only Ground for Peace and Satisfaction.
But pray, my Lord, if none are to be e&s;teemed
<HI>&s;incere,</HI> but tho&s;e who have no Faults, or who&s;e
Faults have no Influence upon their Per&s;wa&s;ions,
who can be a&s;&s;ur'd that he is <HI>&s;incere,</HI> but he that
has the lea&s;t Pretence to it, the <HI>Proud Phari&s;ee?</HI>
If your Lord&s;hip or your Advocates were de&s;ir'd
to prove your Sincerity, either before God or
Man, it mu&s;t be for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, becau&s;e you
have no ill Pa&s;&s;ions or Habits, no faulty Prejudi|ces,
no pa&s;t or pre&s;ent Vices that can have any
Effect upon your Minds. My Lord, as this is
the only Proof that any of you could give of
your own Sincerity in this Meaning of it, &s;o the
very Pretence to it would prove the Wane of it.</P>
