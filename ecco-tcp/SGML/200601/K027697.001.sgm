<P>NEVER poor Wight of a De|dicator had le&s;s hopes from his Dedication, than I have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom, and in a retired thatch'd hou&s;e, where I live in a con&s;tant endeavour to fence again&s;t the infirmities of ill health, and other evils of li&s;e, by

<P>I humbly beg, Sir, that you will honour this book by taking it&mdash;(not under your Protection,&mdash;it mu&s;t protect it&s;elf, but)&mdash;into the country with you; where, if I am ever told, it has made you &s;mile, or can conceive it has beguiled you of one moment's pain&mdash;I &s;hall think my&s;elf as happy as a mini&s;ter of &s;tate;&mdash;perhaps much happier than any

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I Wi&s;h either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly con&s;ider'd how much depended upon what they were then doing;&mdash;that not only the production of a rational Being was con|cern'd in it, but that po&s;&s;ibly the happy formation and temperature of his body,
<PB N="2" REF="6">
perhaps his genius and the very ca&s;t of his mind;&mdash;and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole hou&s;e might take their turn from the humours and di&s;po&s;itions which were then uppermo&s;t:&mdash;Had they duly weighed and con&s;idered all this, and proceeded accordingly,&mdash;I am verily per&s;uaded I &s;hould have made a quite different figure in the world, from that, in which the reader is likely to &s;ee me.&mdash;Believe me, good folks, this is not &s;o incon&s;iderable a thing as many of you may think it;&mdash;you have all, I dare &s;ay, heard of the animal &s;pirits, as how they are transfu&s;ed from father to &s;on, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and a great deal to that purpo&s;e:&mdash;Well, you may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's &s;en&s;e or his non&s;en&s;e, his &s;ucce&s;&s;es and mi&s;carriages in this world depend upon their motions and ac|tivity,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
and the different tracks and trains you put them into, &s;o that when they are once &s;et a going, whether right or wrong, 'tis not a half penny matter,&mdash;away they go cluttering like hey-go-mad; and by treading the &s;ame &s;teps over and over again, they pre&s;ently make a road of it, as plain and as &s;mooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once u&s;ed to, the Devil him&s;elf &s;ometimes &s;hall not be able to drive them off it.</P>
<P><HI>Pray, my dear,</HI> quoth my mother, <HI>have you not forgot to wind up the clock?</HI>&mdash;<HI>Good G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">!</HI> cried my father, making an exclamation, but taking care to moderate his voice at the &s;ame time,&mdash;<HI>Did ever woman, &s;ince the creation of the world, in|terrupt a man with &s;uch a &s;illy que&s;tion?</HI> Pray, what was your father &s;aying?&mdash;Nothing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;Then, po&s;itively, there is nothing in the que&s;tion, that I can &s;ee, either good or bad.&mdash;Then let me tell you, Sir, it was a very un&s;ea&s;onable que&s;tion at lea&s;t,&mdash;becau&s;e it &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed the animal &s;pirits, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to have e&s;corted and gone hand-in-hand with the <HI>HOMUNCULUS,</HI> and con|ducted him &s;afe to the place de&s;tined for his reception.</P>
<P>The HOMUNCULUS, Sir, in how-ever low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in this age of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice:&mdash;to the eye of rea&s;on in &s;cientifick re&s;earch, he &s;tands confe&s;s'd&mdash;a BEING guarded and circum&s;cribed with rights:&mdash;The minute&s;t philo&s;ophers,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
who, by the bye, have the mo&s;t enlarged under&s;tandings, (their &s;ouls being in|ver&s;ely as their enquiries) &s;hew us incon|te&s;tably, That the HOMUNCULUS is created by the &s;ame hand,&mdash;engender'd in the &s;ame cour&s;e of nature,&mdash;endowed with the &s;ame loco-motive powers and faculties with us:&mdash;That he con&s;i&s;ts, as we do, of &s;kin, hair, fat, fle&s;h, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartileges, bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and articulations;&mdash;is a Be|ing of as much activity,&mdash;and, in all &s;en&s;es of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancel|lor of England.&mdash;He may be benefited, he may be injured,&mdash;he may obtain re|dre&s;s;&mdash;in a word, he has all the claims and rights of humanity, which <HI>Tully, Puffendorff,</HI> or the be&s;t ethick writers
<PB N="6" REF="10">

<P>Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone?&mdash;or that, thro' terror of it, natural to &s;o young a traveller, my little gentleman had got to his journey's end mi&s;erably &s;pent;&mdash;his mu&s;cular &s;trength and virility worn down to a thread;&mdash;his own animal &s;pirits ruffled beyond de|&s;cription,&mdash;and that in this &s;ad di&s;order'd &s;tate of nerves, he had laid down a prey to &s;udden &s;tarts, or a &s;eries of melan|choly dreams and fancies for nine long, long months together.&mdash;I tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thou&s;and weakne&s;&s;es both of body and mind, which no &s;kill of the phy&s;i|cian or the philo&s;opher could ever after|wards have &s;et thoroughly to rights.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>TO my uncle Mr. <HI>Toby Shandy</HI> do I &s;tand indebted for the preceding anecdote, to whom my father, who was an excellent natural philo&s;opher, and much given to clo&s;e rea&s;oning upon the &s;malle&s;t matters, had oft, and heavily, complain'd of the injury; but once more particularly, as my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> well re|member'd, upon his ob&s;erving a mo&s;t unaccountable obliquity, (as he call'd it) in my manner of &s;etting up my top, and ju&s;tifying the principles upon which I had done it,&mdash;the old gentleman &s;hook his head, and in a tone more expre&s;&s;ive by half of &s;orrow than reproach,&mdash;he &s;aid his heart all along foreboded, and he &s;aw it verified in this, and from a thou|&s;and other ob&s;ervations he had made up|on

me, That I &s;hould neither think nor act like any other man's child:&mdash;<HI>But alas!</HI> continued he, &s;haking his head a &s;econd time, and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, <HI>My Tri&s;tram's misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;My mother, who was &s;itting by, look'd up,&mdash;but &s;he knew no more than her back&s;ide what my father meant,&mdash;but my uncle, Mr. <HI>Toby Shandy,</HI> who had been often informed of the affair,&mdash;un|der&s;tood him very well.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>I Know there are readers in the world, as well as many other good people in it, who are no readers at all,&mdash;who
<PB N="9" REF="13">
find them&s;elves ill at ea&s;e, unle&s;s they are let into the whole &s;ecret from fir&s;t to la&s;t, of every thing which concerns you.</P>
<P>It is in pure compliance with this hu|mour of theirs, and from a backwardne&s;s in my nature to di&s;appoint any one &s;oul living, that I have been &s;o very particu|lar already. As my life and opinions are likely to make &s;ome noi&s;e in the world, and, if I conjecture right, will take in all ranks, profe&s;&s;ions, and denominations of men whatever,&mdash;be no le&s;s read than the <HI>Pilgrim's Progre&s;s</HI> it&s;elf&mdash;and, in the end, prove the very thing which <HI>Montaigne</HI> dreaded his e&s;&s;ays &s;hould turn out, that is, a book for a parlour-window;&mdash;I find it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult every one a little in his turn; and therefore mu&s;t beg par|don for going on a little further in the &s;ame way: For which cau&s;e, right glad
<PB N="10" REF="14">
I am, that I have begun the hi&s;tory of my&s;elf in the way I have done; and that I am able to go on tracing every thing in it, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, <HI>ab Ovo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Horace,</HI> I know, does not recommend this fa&s;hion altogether: But that gentle|man is &s;peaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy;&mdash;(I forget which)&mdash;be&s;ides, if it was not &s;o, I &s;hould beg Mr. <HI>Horace</HI>'s pardon;&mdash;for in writing what I have &s;et about, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf neither to his rules, nor to any man's rules that ever lived.</P>
<P>To &s;uch, however, as do not choo&s;e to go &s;o far back into the&s;e things, I can give no better advice, than that they &s;kip over the remaining part of this Chapter; for I declare before hand, 'tis
<PB N="11" REF="15">
wrote only for the curious and inqui&s;i|tive.</P>
<P>&mdash;Shut the door.&mdash;I was begot in the night, betwixt the fir&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> and the fir&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> in the month of <HI>March,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighteen. I am po&s;itive I was.&mdash;But how I came to be &s;o very particular in my account of a thing which happened before I was born, is owing to another &s;mall anecdote known only in our own family, but now made publick for the better clearing up this point.</P>
<P>My father, you mu&s;t know, who was originally a <HI>Turkey</HI> merchant, but had left off bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome years, in order to retire to, and die upon, his paternal e&s;tate in the county of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, was, I believe,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
one of the mo&s;t regular men in every thing he did, whether 'twas matter of bu&s;ine&s;s, or matter of amu&s;ement, that ever lived. As a &s;mall &s;pecimen of this extreme exactne&s;s of his, to which he was in truth a &s;lave,&mdash;he had made it a rule for many years of his life,&mdash;on the fir&s;t <HI>Sunday night</HI> of every month through|out the whole year,&mdash;as certain as ever the <HI>Sunday night</HI> came,&mdash;to wind up a large hou&s;e-clock which we had &s;tanding upon the back-&s;tairs head, with his own hands:&mdash;And being &s;omewhere between fifty and &s;ixty years of age, at the time I have been &s;peaking of,&mdash;he had likewi&s;e gradually brought &s;ome other little fa|mily concernments to the &s;ame period, in order, as he would often &s;ay to my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> to get them all out of the way at one time, and be no more plagued
<PB N="13" REF="17">
and pe&s;ter'd with them the re&s;t of the month.</P>
<P>It was attended but with one misfor|tune, which, in a great mea&s;ure, fell upon my&s;elf, and the effects of which I fear I &s;hall carry with me to my grave; namely, that, from an unhappy a&s;&s;ociation of ideas which have no connection in na|ture, it &s;o fell out at length, that my poor mother could never hear the &s;aid clock wound up,&mdash;but the thoughts of &s;ome other things unavoidably popp'd into her head,&mdash;<HI>&amp; vice ver&s;&acirc;:</HI>&mdash;which &s;trange combination of ideas, the &s;aga|cious <HI>Locke,</HI> who certainly under&s;tood the nature of the&s;e things better than mo&s;t men, affirms to have produced more wry actions than all other &s;ources of prejudice what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But this by the bye.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="18">
Now it appears, by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which now lies upon the table, "That on <HI>Lady-Day,</HI> which was on the 25th of the &s;ame month in which I date my geniture,&mdash;my father &s;et out upon his journey to <HI>London</HI> with my elde&s;t brother <HI>Bobby,</HI> to fix him at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;chool;" and, as it appears from the &s;ame authority, "That he did not get down to his wife and family till the <HI>&s;econd week</HI> in <HI>May</HI> following,"&mdash;it brings the thing almo&s;t to a certainty. However, what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt.</P>
<P>&mdash;But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all <HI>December,</HI>&mdash;<HI>January,</HI> and <HI>February?</HI>&mdash;Why, Madam,&mdash;he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;ame village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt al&s;o a thin, upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who, with the help of a little plain good &s;en&s;e, and &s;ome years full employment in her bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in which &s;he had all along tru&s;ted little to her own efforts, and a great deal to tho&s;e of dame nature,&mdash;had acquired, in her way, no &s;mall degree of reputati|on in the world;&mdash;by which word <HI>world,</HI> need I in this place inform your wor&s;hip,
<PB N="20" REF="24">
that I would be under&s;tood to mean no more of it, than a &s;mall circle de&s;cribed upon the circle of the great world, of four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles diameter, or there|abouts, of which the cottage where the good old woman lived, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the centre.&mdash;She had been left it, &s;eems, a widow in great di&s;tre&s;s, with three or four &s;mall children, in her forty|&s;eventh year; and as &s;he was at that time a per&s;on of decent carriage,&mdash;grave de|portment,&mdash;a woman moreover of few words, and withall an object of compa&s;|&s;ion, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ilence under it call'd out the louder for a friendly lift: the wife of the par&s;on of the pari&s;h was touch'd with pity; and having often la|mented an inconvenience, to which her hu&s;band's flock had for many years been expo&s;ed, ina&s;much, as there was no &s;uch thing as a midwife, of any kind or de|gree
<PB N="21" REF="25">
to be got at, let the ca&s;e have been never &s;o urgent, within le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even long miles riding; which &s;aid &s;even long miles in dark nights and di&s;mal roads, the country thereabouts being no|thing but a deep clay, was almo&s;t equal to fourteen; and that in effect was &s;ometimes next to having no midwife at all; it came into her head, that it would be doing as &s;ea&s;onable a kindne&s;s to the whole pari&s;h, as to the poor creature her&s;elf, to get her a little in&s;tructed in &s;ome of the plain principles of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to &s;et her up in it. As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan &s;he had formed than her&s;elf, the Gentle|woman very charitably undertook it; and having great influence over the female part of the pari&s;h, &s;he found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmo&s;t of her wi&s;hes. In truth, the par&s;on join'd his intere&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="26">
with his wife's in the whole affair; and in order to do things as they &s;hould be, and give the poor &s;oul as good a title by law to practi&s;e, as his wife had given by in&s;titution,&mdash;he chearfully paid the fees for the ordinaries licence him&s;elf, amounting, in the whole, to the &s;um of eighteen &s;hillings and fourpence; &s;o that, betwixt them both, the good woman was fully inve&s;ted in the real and corpo|ral po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her office, together with all its <HI>rights, members, and appurtenances what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words, you mu&s;t know, were not according to the old form in which &s;uch licences, faculties, and powers u&s;ually ran, which in like ca&s;es had here|tofore been granted to the &s;i&s;terhood.

<PB N="23" REF="27">
a particular turn for taking to pieces, and new framing over again, all kind of in&s;truments in that way, not only hit upon this dainty amendment, but coax'd many of the old licen&s;ed matrons in the neighbourhood, to open their faculties afre&s;h, in order to have this whim-wham of his in&s;erted.</P>
<P>I own I never could envy <HI>Didius</HI> in the&s;e kinds of fancies of his:&mdash;But every man to his own ta&s;te.&mdash;Did not Dr. <HI>Ku|na&s;trokius,</HI> that great man, at his lei&s;ure hours, take the greate&s;t delight imagina|ble in combing of a&s;&s;es tails, and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth, though he had tweezers always in his pocket?

<P>I Solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was made for no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Poten|tate,&mdash;Duke, Marquis, Earl, Vi&s;count, or Baron of this, or any other Realm in Chri&s;tendom;&mdash;nor has it yet been hawk'd about, or offered publickly or privately, directly or indirectly, to any one per&s;on or per&s;onage, great or &s;mall; but is hone&s;tly a true Virgin-Dedication untried on, upon any &s;oul living.</P>
<P>I labour this point &s;o particularly, merely to remove any offence or objec|tion which might ari&s;e again&s;t it, from the manner in which I propo&s;e to make the mo&s;t of it;&mdash;which is the putting

it up fairly to publick &s;ale; which I now do.</P>
<P>&mdash;Every author has a way of his own, in bringing his points to bear;&mdash;for my own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry&mdash;I re&s;olved within my&s;elf, from the very beginning, to deal &s;quarely and openly with your Great Folks in this af|fair, and try whether I &s;hould not come off the better by it.</P>
<P>If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Vi&s;count, or Baron, in the&s;e his Maje&s;ty's dominions, who &s;tands in need of a tight, genteel dedication, and whom the above will &s;uit, (for by the bye, unle&s;s it &s;uits in &s;ome degree, I will not part with it)&mdash;it is much at his &s;ervice for fifty guineas;&mdash;which

<P>My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a gro&s;s piece of daubing, as &s;ome dedications are.

<P>WHatever degree of &s;mall merit, the act of benignity in favour of the midwife, might ju&s;tly claim, or in whom that claim truly re&s;ted,&mdash;at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems not very material to this hi&s;tory;&mdash;certain however it was, that the gentlewoman, the par&s;on's wife, did run away at that time with the whole of it: And yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the par&s;on him&s;elf,
<PB N="34" REF="38">
tho' he had not the good fortune to hit upon the de&s;ign fir&s;t,&mdash;yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution, had a claim to &s;ome &s;hare of it,&mdash;if not to a full half of whatever honour was due to it.</P>
<P>The world at that time was plea&s;ed to determine the matter otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a probable gue&s;s at the grounds of this procedure.</P>
<P>Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the midwife's licence, of which you have had &s;o cir|cum&s;tantial an account,&mdash;the par&s;on we have to do with, had made him&s;elf a
<PB N="35" REF="39">
country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed again&s;t him&s;elf, his &s;tation, and his office;&mdash;and that was, in never appearing better, or other|wi&s;e mounted, than upon a lean, &s;orry, jack-a&s;s of a hor&s;e, value about one pound fifteen &s;hillings; who, to &s;horten all de&s;cription of him, was full brother to <HI>Ro&s;inante,</HI> as far as &s;imilitude congenial could make him; for he an&s;wered his de&s;cription to a hair-breadth in every thing,&mdash;except that I do not remember 'tis any where &s;aid, that <HI>Ro&s;inante</HI> was broken winded; and that, moreover, <HI>Ro&s;i|nante,</HI> as is the happine&s;s of mo&s;t <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> hor&s;es, fat or lean,&mdash;was undoubtedly a hor&s;e at all points.</P>
<P>I know very well that the HERO'S hor&s;e was a hor&s;e of cha&s;te deportment, which may have given grounds for a
<PB N="36" REF="40">
contrary opinion: But it is as certain at the &s;ame time, that <HI>Ro&s;inante</HI>'s continen|cy (as may be demon&s;trated from the ad|venture of the <HI>Yangue&s;ian</HI> carriers) pro|ceeded from no bodily defect or cau&s;e what&s;oever, but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood.&mdash;And let me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of very good cha&s;tity in the world, in behalf of which you could not &s;ay more for your life.</P>
<P>Let that be as it may, as my purpo&s;e is to do exact ju&s;tice to every creature brought upon the &s;tage of this dramatic work,&mdash;I could not &s;tifle this di&s;tinction in favour of Don <HI>Quixote</HI>'s hor&s;e;&mdash;in all other points the par&s;on's hor&s;e, I &s;ay, was ju&s;t &s;uch another,&mdash;for he was as lean, and as lank, and as &s;orry a jade, as HUMILITY her&s;elf could have be&s;trided.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="41">
In the e&s;timation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was greatly in the par&s;on's power to have helped the figure of this hor&s;e of his,&mdash;for he was ma&s;ter of a very hand&s;ome demi-peak'd &s;addle, quilted on the &s;eat with green plu&s;h, garni&s;hed with a double row of &s;ilver-headed &s;tuds, and a noble pair of &s;hining bra&s;s &s;tirrups, with a hou&s;ing al|together &s;uitable, of grey &s;uperfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, termina|ting in a deep, black, &s;ilk fringe, <HI>poudr&egrave; d'or,</HI>&mdash;all which he had purcha&s;ed in the pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embo&s;&s;ed bridle, ornamented at all points as it &s;hould be.&mdash;But not caring to banter his bea&s;t, he had hung all the&s;e up behind his &s;tudy door;&mdash;and, in lieu of them, had &s;eriou&s;ly befitted him with ju&s;t &s;uch a bridle and &s;uch
<PB N="38" REF="42">
a &s;addle, as the figure and value of &s;uch a &s;teed might well and truly de&s;erve.</P>
<P>In the &s;everal &s;allies about his pari&s;h, and in the neighbouring vi&s;its to the gentry who lived around him,&mdash;you will ea&s;ily comprehend, that the par&s;on, &s;o appointed, would both hear and &s;ee enough to keep his philo&s;ophy from ru&s;ting. To &s;peak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both old and young.&mdash;La|bour &s;tood &s;till as he pa&s;s'd,&mdash;the bucket hung &s;u&s;pended in the middle of the well,&mdash;the &s;pinning-wheel forgot its round,&mdash;even chuck-farthing and &s;huffle-cap them&s;elves &s;tood gaping till he had got out of &s;ight; and as his movement was not of the quicke&s;t, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his ob&s;ervations,&mdash;to hear
<PB N="39" REF="43">
the groans of the &s;erious,&mdash;and the laughter of the light-hearted;&mdash;all which he bore with excellent tranquility.&mdash;His character was,&mdash;he loved a je&s;t in his heart&mdash;and as he &s;aw him&s;elf in the true point of ridicule, he would &s;ay, he could not be angry with others for &s;eeing him in a light, in which he &s;o &s;trongly &s;aw him&s;elf: So that to his friends, who knew his foible was not the love of mo|ney, and who therefore made the le&s;s &s;cruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour,&mdash;in&s;tead of giving the true cau&s;e,&mdash;he cho&s;e rather to join in the laugh again&s;t him&s;elf; and as he never carried one &s;ingle ounce of fle&s;h upon his own bones, being altogether as &s;pare a figure as his bea&s;t,&mdash;he would &s;ometimes in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the hor&s;e was as good as the rider de&s;erved;&mdash;that they were, centaur-like,&mdash;both of a piece. At other
<PB N="40" REF="44">
times, and in other moods, when his &s;pirits were above the temptation of fal&s;e wit,&mdash;he would &s;ay, he found him&s;elf going off fa&s;t in a con&s;umption; and, with great gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the &s;ight of a fat hor&s;e without a dejection of heart, and a &s;en&s;i|ble alteration in his pul&s;e; and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep him&s;elf in coun|tenance, but in &s;pirits.</P>
<P>At different times he would give fifty humourous and oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons for ri|ding a meek-&s;pirited jade of a broken|winded hor&s;e, preferably to one of met|tle;&mdash;for on &s;uch a one he could &s;it me|chanically, and meditate as delightfully <HI>de vanitate mundi et fug&acirc; &s;aeculi,</HI> as with the advantage of a death's head before him;&mdash;that, in all other exercitations, he
<PB N="41" REF="45">
could &s;pend his time, as he rode &s;lowly along,&mdash;to as much account as in his &s;tudy;&mdash;that he could draw up an ar|gument in his &s;ermon,&mdash;or a hole in his breeches, as &s;teadily on the one as in the other;&mdash;that bri&s;k trotting and &s;low ar|gumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible movements.&mdash;But that upon his &s;teed&mdash;he could unite and recon|cile every thing,&mdash;he could compo&s;e his &s;ermon,&mdash;he could compo&s;e his cough,&mdash;and, in ca&s;e nature gave a call that way, he could likewi&s;e compo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;leep.&mdash;In &s;hort, the par&s;on upon &s;uch encounters would a&s;&s;ign any cau&s;e, but the true cau&s;e,&mdash;and he with|held the true one, only out of a nicety of temper, becau&s;e he thought it did ho|nour to him.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46">
But the truth of the &s;tory was as fol|lows: In the fir&s;t years of this gentle|man's life, and about the time when the &s;uperb &s;addle and bridle were purcha&s;ed by him, it had been his manner, or va|nity, or call it what you will,&mdash;to run into the oppo&s;ite extream.&mdash;In the lan|guage of the county where he dwelt, he was &s;aid to have loved a good hor&s;e, and generally had one of the be&s;t in the whole pari&s;h &s;tanding in his &s;table always ready for &s;addling; and as the neare&s;t midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to the village than &s;even miles, and in a vile country,&mdash;it &s;o fell out that the poor gentleman was &s;carce a whole week to|gether without &s;ome piteous application for his bea&s;t; and as he was not an un|kind-hearted man, and every ca&s;e was more pre&s;&s;ing and more di&s;tre&s;sful than the la&s;t,&mdash;as much as he loved his bea&s;t,
<PB N="43" REF="47">
he had never a heart to refu&s;e him; the up&s;hot of which was generally this, that his hor&s;e was either clapp'd, or &s;pavin'd, or greaz'd;&mdash;or he was twitter-bon'd, or broken-winded, or &s;omething, in &s;hort, or other had befallen him which would let him carry no fle&s;h;&mdash;&s;o that he had every nine or ten months a bad hor&s;e to get rid of,&mdash;and a good hor&s;e to purcha&s;e in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>What the lo&s;s in &s;uch a balance might amount to, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> I would leave to a &s;pecial jury of &s;ufferers in the &s;ame traffic, to determine;&mdash;but let it be what it would, the hone&s;t gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to take the thing under con&s;ideration; and upon weighing the whole, and &s;umming it up
<PB N="44" REF="48">
in his mind, he found it not only di&s;pro|portion'd to his other expences, but withall &s;o heavy an article in it&s;elf, as to di&s;able him from any other act of gene|ro&s;ity in his pari&s;h: Be&s;ides this he con&s;idered, that with half the &s;um thus gal|loped away, he could do ten times as much good;&mdash;and what &s;till weighed more with him than all other con&s;idera|tions put together, was this, that it con|fined all his charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the lea&s;t wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his pari&s;h; re&s;erving nothing for the impo|tent,&mdash;nothing for the aged,&mdash;nothing for the many comfortle&s;s &s;cenes he was hourly called forth to vi&s;it, where po|verty, and &s;ickne&s;s, and affliction dwelt together.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="49">
For the&s;e rea&s;ons he re&s;olved to di&s;|continue the expence; and there appear|ed but two po&s;&s;ible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;&mdash;and the&s;e were, either to make it an irrevocable law ne|ver more to lend his &s;teed upon any ap|plication whatever,&mdash;or el&s;e be content to ride the la&s;t poor devil, &s;uch as they had made him, with all his aches and in|firmities, to the very end of the chapter.</P>
<P>As he dreaded his own con&s;tancy in the fir&s;t,&mdash;he very chearfully betook him&s;elf to the &s;econd; and tho' he could very well have explain'd it, as I &s;aid, to his honour,&mdash;yet, for that very rea&s;on, he had a &s;pirit above it; choo&s;ing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a &s;tory, which might &s;eem a panegyric upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50">
I have the highe&s;t idea of the &s;piritual and refined &s;entiments of this reverend gentleman, from this &s;ingle &s;troke in his character, which I think comes up to any of the hone&s;t refinements of the peerle&s;s knight of <HI>La Mancha,</HI> whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would actually have gone further to have paid a vi&s;it to, than the greate&s;t hero of antiquity.</P>
<P>But this is not the moral of my &s;tory: The thing I had in view was to &s;hew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.&mdash;For you mu&s;t know, that &s;o long as this explanation would have done the par&s;on credit,&mdash;the devil a &s;oul could find it out,&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e his enemies would not, and that his friends could not.&mdash;But no &s;ooner did he be&s;tir him&s;elf in behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of
<PB N="47" REF="51">
the ordinary's licence to &s;et her up,&mdash;but the whole &s;ecret came out; every hor&s;e he had lo&s;t, and two hor&s;es more than ever he had lo&s;t, with all the circum|&s;tances of their de&s;truction, were known and di&s;tinctly remembered.&mdash;The &s;tory ran like wild-fire.&mdash;"The par&s;on had a returning fit of pride which had ju&s;t &s;eized him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it was &s;o, 'twas plain as the &s;un at noon-day, he would pocket the ex|pence of the licence, ten times told the very fir&s;t year:&mdash;&s;o that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity."</P>
<P>What were his views in this, and in every other action of his life,&mdash;or rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people concerning it,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
was a thought which too much floated in his own, and too often broke in upon his re&s;t, when he &s;hould have been &s;ound a&s;leep.</P>
<P>About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely ea&s;y upon that &s;core,&mdash;it being ju&s;t &s;o long &s;ince he left his pari&s;h,&mdash;and the whole world at the &s;ame time behind him,&mdash;and &s;tands accountable to a judge of whom he will have no cau&s;e to com|plain.</P>
<P>But there is a fatality attends the ac|tions of &s;ome men: Order them as they will, they pa&s;s thro' a certain medium which &s;o twi&s;ts and refracts them from their true directions&mdash;that, with all the titles to prai&s;e which a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are
<PB N="49" REF="53">
neverthele&s;s forced to live and die with|out it.</P>
<P>Of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful example.&mdash;But to know by what means this came to pa&s;s,&mdash;and to make that knowledge of u&s;e to you, I in&s;i&s;t upon it that you read the two fol|lowing chapters, which contain &s;uch a &s;ketch of his life and conver&s;ation, as will carry its moral along with it.&mdash;When this is done, if nothing &s;tops us in our way, we will go on with the midwife.</P>

<P>YORICK was this par&s;on's name, and, what is very remarkable in it, (as appears from a mo&s;t antient account of the family, wrote upon &s;trong vellum,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
and now in perfect pre&s;ervation) it had been exactly &s;o &s;pelt for near,&mdash;I was within an ace of &s;aying nine hundred years;&mdash;but I would not &s;hake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however indi&s;putable in it&s;elf;&mdash;and therefore I &s;hall content my&s;elf with on|ly &s;aying,&mdash;It had been exactly &s;o &s;pelt, without the lea&s;t variation or tran&s;po&s;i|tion of a &s;ingle letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I would venture to &s;ay of one half of the be&s;t &s;ur|names in the kingdom; which, in a cour&s;e of years, have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their own|ers.&mdash;Has this been owing to the pride, or to the &s;hame of the re&s;pective propri|etors?&mdash;In hone&s;t truth, I think, &s;ome|times to the one, and &s;ometimes to the other, ju&s;t as the temptation has wrought. But a villainous affair it is, and will one

day &s;o blend and confound us all together, that no one &s;hall be able to &s;tand up and &s;wear, "That his own great grand fa|ther was the man who did either this or that."</P>
<P>This evil had been &s;ufficiently fenced again&s;t by the prudent care of the <HI>Yorick</HI>'s family, and their religious pre&s;ervation of the&s;e records I quote, which do fur|ther inform us, That the family was ori|ginally of <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> extraction, and had been tran&s;planted into <HI>England</HI> as early as in the reign of <HI>Horwendillus,</HI> king of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> in who&s;e court it &s;eems, an ance&s;tor of this Mr. <HI>Yorick</HI>'s, and from whom he was lineally de&s;cended, held a con&s;ider|able po&s;t to the day of his death. Of what nature this con&s;iderable po&s;t was, this record &s;aith not;&mdash;it only adds, That, for near two centuries, it had been totally

aboli&s;hed as altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, not only in that court, but in every other court of the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>It has often come into my head, that this po&s;t could be no other than that of the king's chief Je&s;ter;&mdash;and that <HI>Ham|let</HI>'s <HI>Yorick,</HI> in our <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> many of who&s;e plays, you know, are founded up|on authenticated facts,&mdash;was certainly the very man.</P>
<P>I have not the time to look into <HI>Saxo-Grammaticus</HI>'s <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, to know the certainty of this;&mdash;but if you have lei&s;ure, and can ea&s;ily get at the book, you may do it full as well your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t time, in my travels through <HI>Denmark</HI> with Mr. <HI>Noddy</HI>'s elde&s;t &s;on, whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied
<PB N="53" REF="57">
as governor, riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro' mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of which original journey perform'd by us two, a mo&s;t delectable narrative will be given in the progre&s;s of this work. I had ju&s;t time, I &s;ay, and that was all, to prove the truth of an ob&s;ervation made by a long &s;ojourner in that country;&mdash;namely, "That nature was neither very lavi&s;h, nor was &s;he very &s;tingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inha|bitants;&mdash;but, like a di&s;creet parent, was moderately kind to them all; ob&s;erving &s;uch an equal tenor in the di&s;tribution of her favours, as to bring them, in tho&s;e points, pretty near to a level with each other; &s;o that you will meet with few in|&s;tances in that kingdom of refin'd parts; but a great deal of good plain hou&s;hold under&s;tanding among&s;t all ranks of
<PB N="54" REF="58">
people, of which every body has a &s;hare;" which is, I think, very right.</P>
<P>With us, you &s;ee, the ca&s;e is quite different;&mdash;we are all ups and downs in this matter;&mdash;you are a great genius;&mdash;or 'tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great dunce and a blockhead;&mdash;not that there is a total want of intermediate &s;teps,&mdash;no,&mdash;we are not &s;o irregular as that comes to;&mdash;but the two extremes are more common, and in a greater degree in this un&s;ettled i&s;land, where nature, in her gifts and di&s;po&s;itions of this kind, is mo&s;t whim&s;ical and capricious; fortune her|&s;elf not being more &s;o in the beque&s;t of her goods and chattels than &s;he.</P>
<P>This is all that ever &s;tagger'd my faith in regard to <HI>Yorick</HI>'s extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all
<PB N="55" REF="59">
the accounts I could ever get of him, &s;eem'd not to have had one &s;ingle drop of <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> blood in his whole cra&s;is; in nine hundred years, it might po&s;&s;ibly have all run out:&mdash;I will not philo&s;ophize one moment with you about it; for hap|pen how it would, the fact was this:&mdash;That in&s;tead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of &s;en&s;e and humours, you would have look'd for, in one &s;o extract|ed;&mdash;he was, on the contrary, as mer|curial and &s;ublimated a compo&s;ition,&mdash;as heteroclite a creature in all his declen|&s;ions;&mdash;with as much life and whim, and <HI>gait&eacute; de coeur</HI> about him, as the kind|lie&s;t climate could have engendered and put together. With all this &s;ail, poor <HI>Yorick</HI> carried not one ounce of balla&s;t; he was utterly unpracti&s;ed in the world; and, at the age of twenty-&s;ix, knew ju&s;t about as well how to &s;teer his cour&s;e
<PB N="56" REF="60">
in it, as a romping, un&s;u&s;picious girl of thirteen: So that upon his fir&s;t &s;etting out, the bri&s;k gale of his &s;pirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul ten times in a day of &s;ome body's tackling; and as the grave and more &s;low-paced were oftene&s;t in his way,&mdash;you may like|wi&s;e imagine, 'twas with &s;uch he had generally the ill luck to get the mo&s;t en|tangled. For aught I know there might be &s;ome mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of &s;uch <HI>Fracas:</HI>&mdash;For, to &s;peak the truth, <HI>Yorick</HI> had an invincible di&s;|like and oppo&s;ition in his nature to gra|vity;&mdash;not to gravity as &s;uch;&mdash;for where gravity was wanted, he would be the mo&s;t grave or &s;erious of mortal men for days and weeks together;&mdash;but he was an enemy to the affectation of it, and declared open war again&s;t it, only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for
<PB N="57" REF="61">
folly; and then, whenever it fell in his way, however &s;heltered and protected, he &s;eldom gave it much quarter.</P>
<P>Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would &s;ay, That gravity was an errant &s;coundrel; and he would add,&mdash;of the mo&s;t dangerous kind too,&mdash;becau&s;e a fly one; and that, he verily believed, more hone&s;t, well-meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month, than by pocket-picking and &s;hop-lifting in &s;even. In the naked temper which a merry heart di&s;covered, he would &s;ay, There was no danger,&mdash;but to it&s;elf:&mdash;whereas the very e&s;&s;ence of gravity was de&s;ign, and con|&s;equently deceit;&mdash;'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more &s;en&s;e and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its preten&s;ions,&mdash;it was
<PB N="58" REF="62">
no better, but often wor&s;e, than what a <HI>French</HI> wit had long ago defined it,&mdash;<HI>viz. A my&s;terious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind</HI>;&mdash;which definition of gravity, <HI>Yorick,</HI> with great imprudence, would &s;ay, de&s;erved to be wrote in let|ters of gold.</P>
<P>But, in plain truth, he was a man un|hackneyed and unpracti&s;ed in the world, and was altogether as indi&s;creet and fooli&s;h on every other &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e where policy is wont to impre&s;s re&s;traint. <HI>Yorick</HI> had no impre&s;&s;ion but one, and that was what aro&s;e from the nature of the deed &s;poken of; which impre&s;&s;ion he would u&s;ually tran&s;late into plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> without any periphra&s;is,&mdash;and too oft without much di&s;tinction of either per&s;onage, time, or place;&mdash;&s;o that when mention was made of a pitiful or an
<PB N="59" REF="63">
ungenerous proceeding,&mdash;he never gave him&s;elf a moment's time to reflect who was the Hero of the piece,&mdash;what his &s;tation,&mdash;or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter;&mdash;but if it was a dirty action,&mdash;without more ado,&mdash;The man was a dirty fellow,&mdash;and &s;o on:&mdash;And as his comments had u&s;ually the ill fate to be terminated either in a <HI>bon mot,</HI> or to be enliven'd throughout with &s;ome drollery or humour of expre&s;&s;ion, it gave wings to <HI>Yorick</HI>'s indi&s;cretion. In a word, tho' he never &s;ought, yet, at the &s;ame time, as he &s;eldom &s;hun'd occa&s;ions of &s;aying what came uppermo&s;t, and with|out much ceremony;&mdash;he had but too many temptations in life, of &s;cattering his wit and his humour,&mdash;his gibes and his je&s;ts about him.&mdash;They were not lo&s;t for want of gathering.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Mortgager</HI> and <HI>Mortgag&eacute;e</HI> differ the one from the other, not more in length of pur&s;e, than the <HI>Je&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Je&s;t&eacute;e</HI> do, in that of memory. But in this the compari&s;on between them runs, as the &s;cholia&s;ts call it, upon all|four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more, than &s;ome of the be&s;t of <HI>Homer</HI>'s can pretend to;&mdash;namely, That the one rai&s;es a &s;um and the other a laugh at your expence, and think no more about it. Intere&s;t, however, &s;till runs on in both ca&s;es;&mdash;the periodical or accidental payments of it, ju&s;t &s;erving
<PB N="61" REF="65">

<P>As the reader (for I hate your <HI>ifs</HI>) has a thorough knowledge of human nature, I need not &s;ay more to &s;atisfy him, that my Hero could not go on at this rate without &s;ome &s;light experience of the&s;e incidental mementos. To &s;peak the truth, he had wantonly involved him&s;elf in a multitude of &s;mall book-debts of this &s;tamp, which, notwith&s;tanding <HI>Eu|genius</HI>'s frequent advice, he too much di&s;regarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted thro' any malig|nancy;&mdash;but, on the contrary, from an
<PB N="62" REF="66">
hone&s;ty of mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cro&s;s'd out in cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenius</HI> would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an ac|cent of &s;orrowful apprehen&s;ion,&mdash;to the uttermo&s;t mite. To which <HI>Yorick,</HI> with his u&s;ual carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of heart, would as often an&s;wer with a p&s;haw!&mdash;and if the &s;ubject was &s;tarted in the fields,&mdash;with a hop, &s;kip, and a jump, at the end of it; but if clo&s;e pent up in the &s;ocial chimney corner, where the culprit was barrica|do'd in, with a table and a couple of arm chairs, and could not &s;o readily fly off in a tangent,&mdash;<HI>Eugenius</HI> would then go on with his lecture upon di&s;cretion, in
<PB N="63" REF="67">
words to this purpo&s;e, though &s;omewhat better put together.</P>
<P>Tru&s;t me, dear <HI>Yorick,</HI> this unwary plea&s;antry of thine will &s;ooner or later bring thee into &s;crapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can extricate thee out of.&mdash;In the&s;e &s;allies, too oft, I &s;ee, it happens, that a per&s;on laugh'd at, con|&s;iders him&s;elf in the light of a per&s;on in|jured, with all the rights of &s;uch a &s;itua|tion belonging to him; and when thou viewe&s;t him in that light too, and rec|kons up his friends, his family, his kin|dred and allies,&mdash;and mu&s;ters up with them the many recruits which will li&s;t under him from a &s;en&s;e of common dan|ger;&mdash;'tis no extravagant arithmetic to &s;ay, that for every ten jokes,&mdash;thou ha&s;t got a hundred enemies; and till thou ha&s;t gone on, and rai&s;ed a &s;warm of wa&s;ps
<PB N="64" REF="68">
about thy ears, and art half &s;tung to death by them, thou wilt never be con|vinced it is &s;o.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;u&s;pect it in the man whom I e&s;teem, that there is the lea&s;t &s;pur from &s;pleen or malevolence of intent in the&s;e &s;allies.&mdash;I believe and know them to be truly hone&s;t and &s;portive:&mdash;But con|&s;ider, my dear lad, that fools cannot di|&s;tingui&s;h this,&mdash;and that knaves will not; and thou knowe&s;t not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the other,&mdash;whenever they a&s;&s;ociate for mutual defence, depend upon it, they will carry on the war in &s;uch a manner again&s;t thee, my dear friend, as to make thee heartily &s;ick of it, and of thy life too.</P>

<P><PB N="66" REF="70">
<HI>Yorick</HI> &s;carce ever heard this &s;ad va|ticination of his de&s;tiny read over to him, but with a tear &s;tealing from his eye, and a promi&s;&s;ory look attending it, that he was re&s;olved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more &s;obriety.&mdash;But, alas, too late!&mdash;a grand confederacy, with ***** and ***** at the head of it, was form'd before the fir&s;t prediction of it.&mdash;The whole plan of the attack, ju&s;t as <HI>Eugenius</HI> had foreboded, was put in execution all at once,&mdash;with &s;o little mercy on the &s;ide of the allies,&mdash;and &s;o little &s;u&s;picion in <HI>Yorick,</HI> of what was carrying on again&s;t him,&mdash;that when he thought, good ea&s;y man! full &s;urely pre|ferment was o'ripening,&mdash;they had &s;mote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="71">
<HI>Yorick,</HI> however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for &s;ome time; till, over-power'd by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of the war,&mdash;but more &s;o, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on,&mdash;he threw down the &s;word; and though he kept up his &s;pirits in appearance to the la&s;t,&mdash;he died, neverthele&s;s, as was gene|rally thought, quite broken hearted.</P>
<P>What inclined <HI>Eugenius</HI> to the &s;ame opinion, was as follows:</P>
<P>A few hours before <HI>Yorick</HI> breath'd his la&s;t, <HI>Eugenius</HI> &s;tept in with an intent to take his la&s;t &s;ight and la&s;t farewell of him: Upon his drawing <HI>Yorick</HI>'s cur|tain, and a&s;king how he felt him&s;elf, <HI>Yorick,</HI> looking up in his face, took hold of his hand,&mdash;and, after thanking him
<PB N="68" REF="72">
for the many tokens of his friend&s;hip to him, for which, he &s;aid, if it was their fate to meet hereafter,&mdash;he would thank him again and again.&mdash;He told him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the &s;lip for ever.&mdash;I hope not, an&s;wered <HI>Eugenius,</HI> with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tendere&s;t tone that ever man &s;poke,&mdash;I hope not, <HI>Yorick,</HI> &s;aid he.&mdash;<HI>Yorick</HI> replied, with a look up, and a gentle &s;queeze of <HI>Eu|genius</HI>'s hand, and that was all,&mdash;but it cut <HI>Eugenius</HI> to his heart.&mdash;Come,&mdash;come, <HI>Yorick,</HI> quoth <HI>Eugenius,</HI> wiping his eyes, and &s;ummoning up the man within him,&mdash;my dear lad, be comfort|ed,&mdash;let not all thy &s;pirits and fortitude for&s;ake thee at this cri&s;is when thou mo&s;t wants them;&mdash;who knows what re|&s;ources are in &s;tore, and what the power of God may yet do for thee?&mdash;<HI>Yorick</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="73">
laid his hand upon his heart, and gently &s;hook his head;&mdash;for my part, continu|ed <HI>Eugenius,</HI> crying bitterly as he uttered the words,&mdash;I declare I know not, <HI>Yo|rick,</HI> how to part with thee,&mdash;and would gladly flatter my hopes, added <HI>Eugenius,</HI> chearing up his voice, that there is &s;till enough left of thee to make a bi&s;hop,&mdash;and that I may live to &s;ee it.&mdash;I be&s;eech thee, <HI>Eugenius,</HI> quoth <HI>Yorick,</HI> taking off his night-cap as well as he could with his left hand,&mdash;his right being &s;till gra&s;ped clo&s;e in that of <HI>Eugenius,</HI>&mdash;I be&s;eech thee to take a view of my head.&mdash;I &s;ee nothing that ails it, replied <HI>Eugenius.</HI> Then, alas! my friend, &s;aid <HI>Yorick,</HI> let me tell you, that 'tis &s;o brui&s;ed and mi&s;-&s;hapen'd with the blows which ***** and *****, and &s;ome others have &s;o unhand&s;omely given me in the dark, that I might &s;ay

<P><HI>Eugenius</HI> was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend was broke; he &s;queez'd his hand,&mdash;and then walk'd &s;oftly out of the room, weeping as he walk'd. <HI>Yorick</HI> followed <HI>Eugenius</HI> with his eyes to the door,&mdash;he then

<P>I mention this, not only as matter of hypothe&s;is or conjecture upon the pro|gre&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment of my father's many odd opinions,&mdash;but as a warning to the learned reader again&s;t the indi&s;creet reception of &s;uch gue&s;ts, who, after a free and undi&s;turbed enterance, for &s;ome years, into our brains,&mdash;at length claim a kind of &s;ettlement there,&mdash;working &s;ometimes like yea&s;t;&mdash;but more gene|rally after the manner of the gentle pa&s;|&s;ion, beginning in je&s;t,&mdash;but ending in downright earne&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="126">
Whether this was the ca&s;e of the &s;in|gularity of my father's notions,&mdash;or that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of his wit;&mdash;or how far, in many of his notions, he might, tho' odd, be ab&s;olutely right;&mdash;the reader, as he comes at them, &s;hall decide. All that I maintain here, is, that in this one, of the influence of Chri&s;tian names, how|ever it gain'd footing, he was &s;erious;&mdash;he was all uniformity;&mdash;he was &s;y&s;tema|tical, and, like all &s;y&s;tematick rea&s;oners, he would move both heaven and earth, and twi&s;t and torture every thing in na|ture to &s;upport his hypothe&s;is.

<P>This, he would &s;ay, look'd ill;&mdash;and had, moreover, this particular aggrava|tion in it, <HI>viz.</HI> That when once a vile name was wrongfully or injudiciou&s;ly given, 'twas not like the ca&s;e of a man's character, which, when wrong'd, might hereafter be clear'd;&mdash;and, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ometime or other, if not in the man's life, at lea&s;t after his death,&mdash;be, &s;omehow or other, &s;et to rights with the world: But the injury of this, he would &s;ay, could never be undone;&mdash;nay, he doubt|ed even whether an act of parliament could reach it:&mdash;He knew as well as you, that the legi&s;lature a&s;&s;um'd a power over &s;urnames;&mdash;but for very &s;trong rea&s;ons, which he could give, it had ne|ver

<P>It was ob&s;ervable, that tho' my father, in con&s;equence of this opinion, had, as I have told you, the &s;tronge&s;t likings and di&s;likings towards certain names;&mdash;that there were &s;till numbers of names which hung &s;o equally in the balance before him, that they were ab&s;olutely indifferent to him. <HI>Jack, Dick,</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> were of this cla&s;s: The&s;e my father call'd neutral names;&mdash;affirming of them, without a &s;atyr, That there had been as many knaves and fools, at lea&s;t, as wi&s;e and good men, &s;ince the world began, who had indifferently borne them;&mdash;&s;o that, like equal forces acting again&s;t each other in contrary directions, he thought they mutually de&s;troyed each others effects; for which rea&s;on, he would often declare,
<PB N="125" REF="129">
He would not give a cherry-&s;tone to choo&s;e among&s;t them. <HI>Bob,</HI> which was my brother's name, was another of the&s;e neutral kinds of Chri&s;tian names, which operated very little either way; and as my father happen'd to be at <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI> when it was given him,&mdash;he would oft times thank heaven it was no wor&s;e. <HI>Andrew</HI> was &s;omething like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;&mdash;'twas wor&s;e, he &s;aid, than nothing.&mdash;<HI>William</HI> &s;tood pret|ty high:&mdash;<HI>Numps</HI> again was low with him;&mdash;and <HI>Nick,</HI> he &s;aid, was the DEVIL.</P>
<P>But, of all the names in the univer&s;e, he had the mo&s;t unconquerable aver&s;ion for TRISTRAM;&mdash;he had the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the world,&mdash;thinking it could po&s;&s;ibly produce nothing in <HI>rerum natur&acirc;,</HI> but what was extreamly mean and piti|ful:

So that in the mid&s;t of a di&s;pute on the &s;ubject, in which, by the bye, he was frequently involved,&mdash;he would &s;ometimes break off in a &s;udden and &s;pi|rited EPIPHONEMA, or rather EROTESIS, rai&s;ed a third, and &s;ometimes a full fifth, above the key of the di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;and demand it categorically of his antagoni&s;t, Whether he would take upon him to &s;ay, he had ever remember'd,&mdash;whether he had ever read,&mdash;or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, call'd <HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> performing any thing great or worth re|cording?&mdash;No&mdash;, he would &s;ay,&mdash;TRI|STRAM!&mdash;The thing is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<PB N="143" REF="147">
in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I mi&s;take not) mo&s;t fortunately hit upon it.

<P>When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all kind of writings what&s;oever;&mdash;the want of all kind of writing will put an end to all kind of reading;&mdash;and that in time, <HI>As war be|gets poverty, poverty peace,</HI>&mdash;mu&s;t, in

<P>But I forget my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> whom all this while we have left knocking the a&s;hes out of his tobacco pipe.</P>
<P>His humour was of that particular &s;pecies, which does honour to our atmo|&s;phere;
<PB N="146" REF="150">
and I &s;hould have made no &s;cru|ple of ranking him among&s;t one of the fir&s;t-rate productions of it, had not there appear'd too many &s;trong lines in it of a family-likene&s;s, which &s;hewed that he derived the &s;ingularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or water, or any modifications or combina|tions of them whatever: And I have, therefore, oft times wondered, that my father, tho' I believe he had his rea&s;ons for it, upon his ob&s;erving &s;ome tokens of excentricity in my cour&s;e when I was a boy,&mdash;&s;hould never once endeavour to account for them in this way; for all the SHANDY FAMILY were of an original character throughout;&mdash;I mean the males,&mdash;the females had no character at all,&mdash;except, indeed, my great aunt DI|NAH, who, about &s;ixty years ago, was married and got with child by the coach|man, 
<PB N="147" REF="151">
for which my father, according to his hypothe&s;is of Chri&s;tian names, would often &s;ay, She might thank her godfa|thers and godmothers.</P>
<P>It will &s;eem very &s;trange,&mdash;and I would as &s;oon think of dropping a riddle in the reader's way, which is not my in|tere&s;t to do, as &s;et him upon gue&s;&s;ing how it could come to pa&s;s, that an event of this kind, &s;o many years after it had happened, &s;hould be re&s;erved for the in|terruption of the peace and unity, which otherwi&s;e &s;o cordially &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, between my father and my uncle <HI>Toby.</HI> One would have thought, that the whole force of the misfortune &s;hould have &s;pent and wa&s;ted it&s;elf in the family at fir&s;t,&mdash;as is generally the ca&s;e:&mdash;But no|thing ever wrought with our family af|ter the ordinary way. Po&s;&s;ibly at the
<PB N="148" REF="152">
very time this happened, it might have &s;omething el&s;e to afflict it; and as afflic|tions are &s;ent down for our good, and that as this had never done the SHANDY FAMILY any good at all, it might lye waiting till apt times and circum&s;tances &s;hould give it an opportunity to di&s;charge its office.&mdash;Ob&s;erve, I determine nothing upon this.&mdash;My way is ever to point out to the curious, differ|ent tracts of inve&s;tigation, to come at the fir&s;t &s;prings of the events I tell;&mdash;not with a pedantic <HI>Fe&s;cue,</HI>&mdash;or in the deci&s;ive Manner of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who outwits him&s;elf and his reader;&mdash;but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance merely of the inqui&s;itive;&mdash;to them I write,&mdash;and by them I &s;hall be read,&mdash;if any &s;uch reading as this could be &s;uppo&s;ed to hold out &s;o long, to the very end of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="153">
Why this cau&s;e of &s;orrow, therefore, was thus re&s;erved for my father and un|cle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what direction it exerted it&s;elf, &s;o as to become the cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great exactne&s;s, and is as follows:</P>
<P>My uncle TOBY SHANDY, Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues which u&s;ually con&s;titute the character of a man of honour and rectitude,&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed one in a very eminent degree, which is &s;eldom or never put into the catalogue; and that was a mo&s;t extream and unpa|rallel'd mode&s;ty of nature;&mdash;tho' I correct the word nature, for this rea&s;on, that I may not prejudge a point which mu&s;t &s;hortly come to a hearing; and that is, Whether this mode&s;ty of his was na|tural
<PB N="150" REF="154">
or acquir'd.&mdash;Which ever way my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> came by it, 'twas neverthele&s;s mode&s;ty in the true&s;t &s;en&s;e of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was &s;o unhappy as to have very little choice in them,&mdash;but to things;&mdash;and this kind of mode&s;ty &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him, and it aro&s;e to &s;uch a height in him, as almo&s;t to equal, if &s;uch a thing could be, even the mode&s;ty of a woman: That female nicety, Ma|dam, and inward cleanline&s;s of mind and fancy, in your &s;ex, which makes you &s;o much the awe of ours.</P>
<P>You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had contracted all this from this very &s;ource;&mdash;that he had &s;pent a great part of his time in conver&s;e with your &s;ex; and that, from a thorough knowledge of you, and the force of imita|tion
<PB N="151" REF="155">
which &s;uch fair examples render ir|re&s;i&s;table,&mdash;he had acquired this amiable turn of mind.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;ay &s;o,&mdash;for unle&s;s it was with his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, my father's wife and my mother,&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> &s;carce exchanged three words with the &s;ex in as many years;&mdash;no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.&mdash;A blow!&mdash;Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a &s;tone, broke off by a ball from the para|pet of a horn-work at the &s;iege of <HI>Namur,</HI> which &s;truck full upon my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s groin.&mdash;Which way could that effect it? The &s;tory of that, Madam, is long and intere&s;ting;&mdash;but it would be running my hi&s;tory all upon heaps to give it you here.&mdash;'Tis for an epi&s;ode hereafter; and every circum&s;tance relating to it in its proper place, &s;hall be faithfully laid
<PB N="152" REF="156">
before you:&mdash;'Till then, it is not in my power to give further light into this matter, or &s;ay more than what I have &s;aid already,&mdash;That my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was a gentleman of unparallel'd mode&s;ty, which happening to be &s;omewhat &s;ub|tilized and rarified by the con&s;tant heat of a little family-pride,&mdash;they both &s;o wrought together within him, that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt DINAH touch'd upon, but with the greate&s;t emotion.&mdash;The lea&s;t hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face;&mdash;but when my father enlarged upon the &s;tory in mixed companies, which the illu&s;tration of his hypothe&s;is frequently obliged him to do,&mdash;the un|fortunate blight of one of the faire&s;t branches of the family, would &s;et my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s honour and mode&s;ty o'bleed|ing; and he would often take my fa|ther
<PB N="153" REF="157">
a&s;ide, in the greate&s;t concern ima|ginable, to expo&s;tulate and tell him, he would give him any thing in the world, only to let the &s;tory re&s;t.</P>
<P>My father, I believe, had the true&s;t love and tenderne&s;s for my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> that ever one brother bore towards ano|ther, and would have done any thing in nature, which one brother in rea&s;on could have de&s;ir'd of another, to have made my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s heart ea&s;y in this, or any o|ther point. But this lay out of his power.</P>
<P>&mdash;My father, as I told you, was a philo&s;opher in grain,&mdash;&s;peculative,&mdash;&s;y&s;tematical;&mdash;and my aunt <HI>Dinah</HI>'s af|fair was a matter of as much con&s;equence to him, as the retrogradation of the pla|nets to <HI>Copernicus:</HI>&mdash;The back&s;lidings of <HI>Venus</HI> in her orbit fortified the <HI>Copernican</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="158">
&s;y&s;tem, call'd &s;o after his name; and the back&s;lidings of my aunt <HI>Dinah</HI> in her or|bit, did the &s;ame &s;ervice in e&s;tabli&s;hing my father's &s;y&s;tem, which, I tru&s;t, will for ever hereafter be call'd the <HI>Shandean Sy&s;tem,</HI> after his.</P>
<P>In any other family di&s;honour, my fa|ther, I believe, had as nice a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame as any man whatever;&mdash;and neither he, nor, I dare &s;ay, <HI>Copernicus,</HI> would have divulged the affair in either ca&s;e, or have taken the lea&s;t notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.&mdash;<HI>Amicus Plato,</HI> my father would &s;ay, con|&s;truing the words to my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> as he went along, <HI>Amicus Plato</HI>; that is, DINAH was my aunt;&mdash;<HI>&s;ed magis amica veritas</HI>&mdash;but TRUTH is my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="159">
This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the &s;ource of many a fraternal &s;quabble. The one could not bear to hear the tale of family di&s;grace recorded,&mdash;and the other would &s;carce ever let a day pa&s;s to an end without &s;ome hint at it.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> would cry,&mdash;and for my &s;ake, and for all our &s;akes, my dear brother <HI>Shandy,</HI>&mdash;do let this &s;tory of our aunt's and her a&s;hes &s;leep in peace;&mdash;how can you,&mdash;how can you have &s;o little feeling and compa&s;&s;ion for the character of our fa|mily:&mdash;What is the character of a fa|mily to an hypothe&s;is? my father would reply.&mdash;Nay, if you come to that&mdash;what is the life of a family:&mdash;The life of a family!&mdash;my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> would &s;ay, throwing him&s;elf back in his arm-chair,
<PB N="156" REF="160">
and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg.&mdash;Yes the life,&mdash;my father would &s;ay, maintaining his point. How many thou&s;ands of 'em are there every year that comes ca&s;t away, (in all civilized countries at lea&s;t)&mdash;and con|&s;ider'd as nothing but common air, in competition of an hypothe&s;is. In my plain &s;en&s;e of things, my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> would an&s;wer,&mdash;every &s;uch in&s;tance is downright MURDER, let who will commit it.&mdash;There lies your mi&s;take, my father would reply;&mdash;for, in <HI>Foro Scientiae</HI> there is no &s;uch thing as MUR|DER,&mdash;'tis only DEATH, brother.</P>
<P>My uncle <HI>Toby</HI> would never offer to an&s;wer this by any other kind of argu|ment, than that of whi&s;tling half a dozen bars of <HI>Lillabullero.</HI>&mdash;You mu&s;t know
<PB N="157" REF="161">
it was the u&s;ual channel thro' which his pa&s;&s;ions got vent, when any thing &s;hock|ed or &s;urpri&s;ed him;&mdash;but e&s;pecially when any thing, which he deem'd very ab&s;urd, was offered.</P>
<P>AS not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this particular &s;pecies of argument,&mdash;I here take the liberty to do it my&s;elf, for two rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, That, in order to prevent all confu&s;ion in di&s;|putes, it may &s;tand as much di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for ever, from every other &s;pecies of argument,&mdash;as the <HI>Argumentum ad Verecundiam, ex Ab&s;urdo, ex Fortiori,</HI> or any other argument what&s;oever:&mdash;And, &s;econdly, That it may be &s;aid by my chil|dren's children, when my head is laid to re&s;t,&mdash;that their learned grand-father's

head had been bu&s;ied to as much pur|po&s;e once, as other people's:&mdash;That he had invented a name,&mdash;and generou&s;ly thrown it into the TREASURY of the <HI>Ars Logica,</HI> for one of the mo&s;t unan|&s;werable arguments in the whole &s;cience. And if the end of di&s;putation is more to &s;ilence than convince,&mdash;they may add, if they plea&s;e, to one of the be&s;t arguments too.</P>
<P>I do therefore, by the&s;e pre&s;ents, &s;trictly order and command, That it be known and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name and title of the <HI>Argumentum Fi&s;tulatorium,</HI> and no other;&mdash;and that it rank here|after with the <HI>Argumentum Baculinum,</HI> and the <HI>Argumentum ad Crumenam,</HI> and for ever hereafter be treated of in the &s;ame chapter.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="163">
As for the <HI>Argumentum Tripodium,</HI> which is never u&s;ed but by the woman again&s;t the man;&mdash;and the <HI>Argumentum ad Rem,</HI> which, contrarywi&s;e, is made u&s;e of by the man only again&s;t the woman:&mdash;As the&s;e two are enough in con&s;cience for one lecture;&mdash;and, moreover, as the one is the be&s;t an&s;wer to the other,&mdash;let them likewi&s;e be kept apart, and be treated of in a place by them&s;elves.</P>

"That it is an abominable thing for a man to commend him&s;elf;"&mdash;and I real|ly think it is &s;o.</P>
<P>And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a ma&s;terly kind of a fa&s;hion, which thing is not likely to be found out;&mdash;I think it is full as abomi|nable, that a man &s;hould lo&s;e the ho|nour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head.</P>
<P>This is preci&s;ely my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>For in this long digre&s;&s;ion which I was accidentally led into, as in all my digre&s;|&s;ions (one only excepted) there is a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of digre&s;&s;ive &s;kill, the me|rit of which has all along, I fear, been overlooked by my reader,&mdash;not for want of penetration in him,&mdash;but becau&s;e 'tis
<PB N="161" REF="165">
an excellence &s;eldom looked for, or ex|pected indeed, in a digre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;and it is this: That tho' my digre&s;&s;ions are all fair, as you ob&s;erve,&mdash;and that I fly off from what I am about, as far and as of|ten too as any writer in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; yet I con&s;tantly take care to order affairs &s;o, that my main bu&s;ine&s;s does not &s;tand &s;till in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s mo&s;t whim&s;ical character;&mdash;when my aunt <HI>Dinah</HI> and the coachman came a-cro&s;s us, and led us a vagary &s;ome mil|lions of miles into the very heart of the planetary &s;y&s;tem: Notwith&s;tanding all this you perceive that the drawing of my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s character went on gently all the time;&mdash;not the great contours of it,&mdash;that was impo&s;&s;ible,&mdash;but &s;ome fa|miliar
<PB N="162" REF="166">
&s;trokes and faint de&s;ignations of it, were here and there touch'd in, as we went along, &s;o that you are much better acquainted with my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> now than you was before.</P>
<P>By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a &s;pecies by it&s;elf; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled, which were thought to be at variance with each other. In a word, my work is digre&s;&s;ive, and it is progre&s;&s;ive too,&mdash;and at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a very different &s;tory from that of the earth's moving round her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progre&s;s in her elliptick orbit which brings about the year, and con&s;titutes that variety and vici&s;&s;itude of &s;ea&s;ons we enjoy;&mdash;though I own it &s;ugge&s;ted the
<PB N="163" REF="167">
thought,&mdash;as I believe the greate&s;t of our boa&s;ted improvements and di&s;cove|ries have come from &s;ome &s;uch trifling hints.</P>
<P>Digre&s;&s;ions, inconte&s;tably, are the &s;un-&s;hine;&mdash;they are the life, the &s;oul of reading;&mdash;take them out of this book for in&s;tance,&mdash;you might as well take the book along with them;&mdash;one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it; re&s;tore them to the writer;&mdash;he &s;teps forth like a bridegroom,&mdash;bids All hail; brings in variety, and forbids the appe|tite to fail.</P>
<P>All the dexterity is in the good cook|ery and management of them, &s;o as to be not only for the advantage of the reader, but al&s;o of the author, who&s;e di|&s;tre&s;s, in this matter, is truely pitiable:
<PB N="164" REF="168">
For, if he begins a digre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;from that moment, I ob&s;erve, his whole work &s;tands &s;tock-&s;till;&mdash;and if he goes on with his main work,&mdash;then there is an end of his digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&mdash;This is vile work.&mdash;For which rea&s;on, from the beginning of this, you &s;ee, I have con&s;tructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with &s;uch inter&s;ections, and have &s;o complicated and involved the digre&s;&s;ive and proge&s;|&s;ive movements, one wheel within ano|ther, that the whole machine, in general, has been kept a-going;&mdash;and, what's more, it &s;hall be kept a-going the&s;e forty years, if it plea&s;es the fountain of health to ble&s;s me &s;o long with life and good &s;pirits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Have a &s;trong propen&s;ity in me to begin this chapter very non&s;en&s;ically, and I will not balk my fancy.&mdash;Accord|ingly I &s;et off thus.</P>
<P>If the fixure of <HI>Momus</HI>'s gla&s;s, in the human brea&s;t, according to the propo&s;ed emendation of that arch-critick, had ta|ken place,&mdash;fir&s;t, This fooli&s;h con&s;e|quence would certainly have followed,&mdash;That the very wi&s;e&s;t and the very grave&s;t of us all, in one coin or other, mu&s;t have paid window-money every day of our lives.</P>
<P>And, &s;econdly, That had the &s;aid gla&s;s been there &s;et up, nothing more would have been wanting, in order to have ta|ken
<PB N="166" REF="170">
a man's character, but to have ta|ken a chair and gone &s;oftly, as you would to a dioptrical bee-hive, and look'd in,&mdash;view'd the &s;oul &s;tark naked;&mdash;ob&s;erv'd all her motions,&mdash;her machinations;&mdash;traced all her maggots from their fir&s;t engendering to their crawling forth;&mdash;watched her loo&s;e in her fri&s;ks, her gam|bols, her capricios; and ofter &s;ome no|tice of her more &s;olemn deportment, con|&s;equent upon &s;uch fri&s;ks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;then taken your pen and ink and &s;et down nothing but what you had &s;een, and could have &s;worn to:&mdash;But this is an advantage not to be had by the bio|grapher in this planet,&mdash;in the planet <HI>Mercury</HI> (belike) it may be &s;o, if not better, &s;till for him;&mdash;for there the in|ten&s;e heat of the country, which is pro|ved by computators, from its vicinity to the &s;un, to be more than equal to that
<PB N="167" REF="171">
of red hot iron,&mdash;mu&s;t, I think, long ago have vitrified the bodies of the inhabi|tants, (as the efficient cau&s;e) to &s;uit them for the climate (which is the final cau&s;e); &s;o that, betwixt them both, all the tene|ments of their &s;ouls, from top to bot|tom, may be nothing el&s;e, for aught the &s;ounde&s;t philo&s;ophy can &s;hew to the con|trary, but one fine tran&s;parent body of clear gla&s;s (bating the umbilical knot);&mdash;&s;o, that till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of light, in pa&s;&s;ing through them, become &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly refracted,&mdash;or return reflected from their &s;urfaces in &s;uch tran&s;ver&s;e lines to the eye, that a man cannot be &s;een thro';&mdash;his &s;oul might as well, unle&s;s, for more ceremony,&mdash;or the trifling advantage which the umbi|lical point gave her,&mdash;might, upon all
<PB N="168" REF="172">
other accounts, I &s;ay, as well play the fool out o'doors as in her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But this, as I &s;aid above, is not the ca&s;e of the inhabitants of this earth;&mdash;our minds &s;hine not through the body, but are wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncry&s;talized fle&s;h and blood; &s;o that if we would come to the &s;pecifick cha|racters of them, we mu&s;t go &s;ome other way to work.</P>
<P>Many, in good truth, are the ways which human wit has been forced to take to do this thing with exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Some, for in&s;tance, draw all their cha|racters with wind in&s;truments.&mdash;<HI>Virgil</HI> takes notice of that way in the affair of <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI>;&mdash;but it is as fallacious as the breath of fame;&mdash;and, moreover,
<PB N="169" REF="173">
be&s;peaks a narrow genius. I am not ig|norant that the <HI>Italians</HI> pretend to a ma|thematical exactne&s;s in their de&s;ignations of one particular &s;ort of character among them, from the <HI>forte</HI> or <HI>piano</HI> of a cer|tain wind in&s;trument they u&s;e,&mdash;which they &s;ay is infallible.&mdash;I dare not men|tion the name of the in&s;trument in this place;&mdash;'tis &s;ufficient we have it among&s;t us,&mdash;but never think of making a draw|ing by it;&mdash;this is aenigmatical, and in|tended to be &s;o, at lea&s;t, <HI>ad populum:</HI>&mdash;And therefore I beg, Madam, when you come here, that you read on as fa&s;t as you can, and never &s;top to make any in|quiry about it.</P>
<P>There are others again, who will draw a man's character from no other helps in the world, but merely from his evacua|tions;&mdash;but this often gives a very in|correct
<PB N="170" REF="174">
out-line,&mdash;unle&s;s, indeed, you take a &s;ketch of his repletions too; and by correcting one drawing from the other, compound one good figure out of them both.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have no objection to this me|thod, but that I think it mu&s;t &s;mell too &s;trong of the lamp,&mdash;and be render'd &s;till more opero&s;e, by forcing you to have an eye to the re&s;t of his <HI>Non-Naturals.</HI>&mdash;Why the mo&s;t natural actions of a man's life &s;hould be call'd his Non-Naturals,&mdash;is another que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There are others, fourthly, who di&s;|dain every one of the&s;e expedients;&mdash;not from any fertility of his own, but from the various ways of doing it, which they have borrowed from the honourable de|vices
<PB N="171" REF="175">
which the Pentagraphic Brethren <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pentagraph, an in&s;trument to copy prints and pictures mechanichally, and in any proportion.</NOTE> of the bru&s;h have &s;hewn in taking co|pies.&mdash;The&s;e, you mu&s;t know, are your great hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e you will &s;ee drawing a full-length character <HI>again&s;t the light</HI>;&mdash;that's illiberal,&mdash;di&s;hone&s;t,&mdash;and hard upon the character of the man who &s;its.</P>
<P>Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the <HI>Camera</HI>;&mdash;that is mo&s;t unfair of all,&mdash;becau&s;e, <HI>there</HI> you are &s;ure to be repre&s;ented in &s;ome of your mo&s;t ridiculous attitudes.</P>
<P>To avoid all and every one of the&s;e errors, in giving you my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s character, I am determin'd to draw it by
<PB N="172" REF="176">
no mechanical help whatever;&mdash;nor &s;hall my pencil be guided by any one wind in&s;trument which ever was blown upon, either on this, or on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Alps</HI>;&mdash;nor will I con&s;ider either his repletions or his di&s;charges,&mdash;or touch upon his Non-Naturals;&mdash;but, in a word, I will draw my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s character from his HOBBY-HORSE.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>IF I was not morally &s;ure that the reader mu&s;t be out of all patience for my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s character,&mdash;I would here previou&s;ly have convinced him, that there is no in&s;trument &s;o fit to draw &s;uch a thing with, as that which I have pitch'd upon.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="177">
A man and his HOBBY-HORSE, tho' I cannot &s;ay that they act and re-act exactly after the &s;ame manner in which the &s;oul and body do upon each other: Yet doubtle&s;s there is a communication between them of &s;ome kind, and my opinion rather is, that there is &s;omething in it more of the manner of electrified bodies,&mdash;and that by means of the heated parts of the rider, which come immedi|ately into contact with the back of the HOBBY-HORSE.&mdash;By long journies and much friction, it &s;o happens that the bo|dy of the rider is at length fill'd as full of HOBBY-HORSICAL matter as it can hold;&mdash;&s;o that if you are able to give but a clear de&s;cription of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="178">
NOW the HOBBY-HORSE which my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> always rode upon, was, in my opinion, an HOBBY-HORSE well worth giving a de&s;cription of, if it was only upon the &s;core of his great &s;ingularity; for you might have travelled from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI>&mdash;from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Penzance</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and from <HI>Penzance</HI> to <HI>York</HI> back again, and not have &s;een &s;uch another upon the road; or if you had &s;een &s;uch a one, whatever ha&s;te you had been in, you mu&s;t infallibly have &s;topp'd to have taken a view of him. Indeed, the gait and figure of him was &s;o &s;trange, and &s;o utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole &s;pecies, that it was now and then made a matter of di&s;pute,&mdash;whether he was really a HOBBY-HORSE or no: But as the Philo|&s;opher would u&s;e no other argument to the &s;ceptic, who di&s;puted with him again&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="179">
the reality of motion, &s;ave that of ri&s;ing up upon his legs, and walking a cro&s;s the room;&mdash;&s;o would my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> u&s;e no other argument to prove his HOBBY-HORSE was a HOBBY-HORSE indeed, but by getting upon his back and riding him about;&mdash;leaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit.</P>
<P>In good truth, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> mounted him with &s;o much plea&s;ure, and he car|ried my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> &s;o well,&mdash;that he troubled his head very little with what the world either &s;aid or thought about it.</P>
<P>It is now high time, however, that I give you a de&s;cription of him:&mdash;But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you fir&s;t, how my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> came by him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE wound in my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s groin, which he received at the &s;iege of <HI>Namur,</HI> rendering him unfit for the &s;ervice, it was thought expedient he &s;hould return to <HI>England,</HI> in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to be &s;et to rights.</P>
<P>He was four years totally confined,&mdash;part of it to his bed, and all of it to his room; and in the cour&s;e of his cure, which was all that time in hand, &s;uffer'd un&s;peakable mi&s;eries,&mdash;owing to a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of exfoliations from the <HI>o&s;s pubis,</HI> and the outward edge of that part of the <HI>coxendix</HI> called the <HI>o&s;s illeum,</HI>&mdash;both which bones were di&s;mally cru&s;h'd, as much by the irregularity of the &s;tone, which I told you was broke off the pa|rapet,<PB N="177" REF="181">
&mdash;as
by its &s;ize,&mdash;(though it was pretty large) which inclined the &s;urgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it had done my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>'s groin, was more owing to the gravity of the &s;tone it&s;elf, than to the projectile force of it,&mdash;which he would often tell him was a great happine&s;s.</P>
<P>My father at that time was ju&s;t begin|ning bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>London,</HI> and had taken a hou&s;e;&mdash;and as the true&s;t friend&s;hip and cordiality &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two bro|thers,&mdash;and that my father thought my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> could no where be &s;o well nur&s;ed and taken care of as in his own hou&s;e,&mdash;he a&s;&s;ign'd him the very be&s;t apartment in it.&mdash;And what was a much more &s;incere mark of his affection &s;till, he would never &s;uffer a friend or an ac|quaintance to &s;tep into the hou&s;e on any
<PB N="178" REF="182">
occa&s;ion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead him up &s;tairs to &s;ee his brother <HI>Toby,</HI> and chat an hour by his bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a &s;oldier's wound be|guiles the pain of it;&mdash;my uncle's vi&s;it|ers at lea&s;t thought &s;o, and in their daily calls upon him, from the courte&s;y ari&s;ing out of that belief, they would frequently turn the di&s;cour&s;e to that &s;ubject,&mdash;and from that &s;ubject the di&s;cour&s;e would generally roll on to the &s;iege it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e conver&s;ations were infinitely kind; and my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> received great relief from them, and would have recei|ved much more, but that they brought him into &s;ome unfore&s;een perplexities, which, for three months together, re|tarded his cure greatly; and if he had
<PB N="179" REF="183">
not hit upon an expedient to extricate him&s;elf out of them, I verily believe they would have laid him in his grave.</P>
<P>What the&s;e perplexities of my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> were,&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible for you to gue&s;s;&mdash;if you could,&mdash;I &s;hould blu&s;h; not as a relation,&mdash;not as a man,&mdash;nor even as a woman,&mdash;but I &s;hould blu&s;h as an author; ina&s;much as I &s;et no &s;mall &s;tore by my&s;elf upon this very account, that my reader has never yet been able to gue&s;s at any thing. And in this, Sir, I am of &s;o nice and &s;ingular a humour, that if I thought you was able to form the lea&s;t judgment or probable conjecture to your&s;elf, of what was to come in the next page,&mdash;I would tear it out of my book.</P>
