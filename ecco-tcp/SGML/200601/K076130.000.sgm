<P>IT has always appeared to me, that to give to the public &s;ome account of the life of a per&s;on of eminent merit decea&s;ed, is a duty incumbent on &s;ur|vivors. It &s;eldom happens that &s;uch a per&s;on pa&s;&s;es through life, without being the &s;ubject of thoughtle&s;s ca|lumny, or malignant mi&s;repre&s;entation.
<PB N="2" REF="3">
It cannot happen that the public at large &s;hould be on a footing with their intimate acquaintance, and be the ob|&s;erver of tho&s;e virtues which di&s;cover them&s;elves principally in per&s;onal in|tercour&s;e. Every benefactor of man|kind is more or le&s;s influenced by a liberal pa&s;&s;ion for fame; and &s;urvivors only pay a debt due to the&s;e benefac|tors, when they a&s;&s;ert and e&s;tabli&s;h on their part, the honour they loved. The ju&s;tice which is thus done to the illu&s;|trious dead, converts into the faire&s;t &s;ource of animation and encourage|ment to tho&s;e who would follow them in the &s;ame carreer. The human &s;pecies at large is intere&s;ted in this ju&s;tice, as it teaches them to place their re&s;pect and affection, upon tho&s;e qualities which be&s;t de&s;erve to be e&s;teemed and loved. I cannot ea&s;ily
<PB N="3" REF="4">
prevail on my&s;elf to doubt, that the more fully we are pre&s;ented with the picture and &s;tory of &s;uch per&s;ons as the &s;ubject of the following narrative, the more generally &s;hall we feel in our&s;elves an attachment to their fate, and a &s;ympathy in their excellencies. There are not many individuals with who&s;e character the public welfare and improvement are more intimately connected, than the author of A Vindi|cation of the Rights of Woman.</P>
<P>The facts detailed in the following pages, are principally taken from the mouth of the per&s;on to whom they relate; and of the veracity and inge|nuou&s;ne&s;s of her habits, perhaps no one that was ever acquainted with her, entertains a doubt. The writer of this narrative, when he has met with per|&s;ons, that in any degree created to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
them&s;elves an intere&s;t and attachment in his mind, has always felt a curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the &s;cenes through which they had pa&s;&s;ed, and the incidents that had contributed to form their under&s;tandings and charac|ter. Impelled by this &s;entiment, he repeatedly led the conver&s;ation of Mary to topics of this &s;ort; and, once or twice, he made notes in her pre|&s;ence, of a few dates calculated to arrange the circum&s;tances in his mind. To the materials thus collected, he has added an indu&s;trious enquiry among the per&s;ons mo&s;t intimately acquainted with her at the different periods of her life.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>Mary Woll&s;tonecraft was born on the 27th of April 1759. Her father's name was Edward John, and the name
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of her mother Elizabeth, of the family of Dixons of Bally&s;hannon in the king|dom of Ireland: her paternal grand|father was a re&s;pectable manufacturer in Spitalfields, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have left to his &s;on a property of about 10,000l. Three of her brothers and two &s;i&s;ters are &s;till living, their names, Edward, James, Charles, Eliza, and Everina. Of the&s;e, Edward only was older than her&s;elf; he re&s;ides in Lon|don. James is in Paris, and Charles in or near Philadelphia in America. Her &s;i&s;ters have for &s;ome years been engag|ed in the office of governe&s;&s;es in private families, and are both at pre&s;ent in Ireland.</P>
<P>I am doubtful whether the father of Mary was bred to any profe&s;&s;ion; but, about the time of her birth, he re&s;orted, rather perhaps as an amu&s;ement than
<PB N="6" REF="7">
a bu&s;ine&s;s, to the occupation of farm|ing. He was of a very active, and &s;omewhat ver&s;atile di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o frequently changed his abode, as to throw &s;ome ambiguity upon the place of her birth. She told me, that the doubt in her mind in that re&s;pect, lay between London, and a farm upon Epping Fore&s;t, which was the princi|pal &s;cene of the five fir&s;t years of her life.</P>
<P>Mary was di&s;tingui&s;hed in early youth, by &s;ome portion of that exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, &s;oundne&s;s of under&s;tand|ing, and deci&s;ion of character, which were the leading features of her mind through the whole cour&s;e of her life. She experienced in the fir&s;t period of her exi&s;tence, but few of tho&s;e indul|gences and marks of affection, which are principally calculated to &s;ooth the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;ubjection and &s;orrows of our early years She was not the favourite either of her father or mother. Her father was a man of a quick, impetu|ous di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ubject to alternate fits of kindne&s;s and cruelty. In his family he was a de&s;pot, and his wife appears to have been the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive of his &s;ubjects. The mother's partiality was fixed upon the elde&s;t &s;on, and her &s;y&s;tem of government relative to Mary, was characterized by con&s;i|derable rigour. She, at length, became convinced of her mi&s;take, and adopted a different plan with her younger daughters. When, in the Wrongs of Woman, Mary &s;peaks of "the petty cares which ob&s;cured the morning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> her heroine's life; continual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> mo&s;t trivial matters; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to orders, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">

mere child, &s;he &s;oon di&s;covered to be unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent and contradictory; and the being often obliged to fit, in the pre&s;ence of her parents, for three or four hours toge|ther, without daring to utter a word;" &s;he is, I believe, to be con&s;idered as copying the outline of the fir&s;t period of her own exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But it was in vain, that the blighting winds of unkindne&s;s or indifference, &s;eemed de&s;tined to counteract the &s;u|periority of Mary's mind. It &s;ur|mounted every ob&s;tacle; and, by de|grees, from a per&s;on little con&s;idered in the family, &s;he became in &s;ome &s;ort its director and umpire. The de&s;po|ti&s;m of her education co&s;t her many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> heart-ache. She was not formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the contented and unre&s;i&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> de&s;pot; but I have heard her

remark more than once, that, when &s;he felt &s;he had done wrong, the reproof or cha&s;ti&s;ement of her mother, in&s;tead of being a terror to her, &s;he found to be the only thing capable of reconciling her to her&s;elf. The blows of her fa|ther on the contrary, which were the mere ebullitions of a pa&s;&s;ionate tem|per, in&s;tead of humbling her, rou&s;ed her indignation. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;he felt her &s;uperiority, and was apt to betray marks of contempt. The quick|ne&s;s of her father's temper, led him &s;ometimes to threaten &s;imilar violence towards his wife. When that was the ca&s;e, Mary would often throw her&s;elf between the de&s;pot and his victim, with the purpo&s;e to receive upon her own per&s;on the blows that might be directed again&s;t her mother. She has even laid whole nights upon the land|ing-place
<PB N="10" REF="13">
near their chamber-door, when, mi&s;takenly, or with rea&s;on, &s;he apprehended that her father might break out into paroxy&s;ms of violence. The conduct he held towards the mem|bers of his family, was of the &s;ame kind as that he ob&s;erved towards ani|mals. He was for the mo&s;t part extra|vagantly fond of them; but, when he was di&s;plea&s;ed, and this frequently happened, and for very trivial rea|&s;ons, his anger was alarming. Mary was what Dr. John&s;on would have called, "a very good hater." In &s;ome in&s;tance of pa&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by her father to one of his dogs, &s;he was ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;peak of her emotions of abhorrence, as having ri&s;en to agony. In a word, her conduct during her girli&s;h years, was &s;uch, as to extort &s;ome portion of affection from her mo|ther,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
and to hold her father in con&s;i|derable awe.</P>
<P>In one re&s;pect, the &s;y&s;tem of educa|tion of the mother appears to have had merit. All her children were vigo|rous and healthy. This &s;eems very much to depend upon the management of our infant years. It is affirmed by &s;ome per&s;ons of the pre&s;ent day, mo&s;t profoundly &s;killed in the &s;ciences of health and di&s;ea&s;e, that there is no period of human life &s;o little &s;ubject to mortality, as the period of infancy. Yet, from the mi&s;management to which children are expo&s;ed, many of the di&s;ea&s;es of childhood are rendered fatal, and more per&s;ons die in that, than in any other period of human life. Mary had projected a work upon this &s;ubject, which &s;he had carefully con&s;i|dered, and well under&s;tood. She has
<PB N="12" REF="15">
indeed left a &s;pecimen of her &s;kill in this re&s;pect in her elde&s;t daughter, three years and a half old, who is a &s;in|gular example of vigorous con&s;titution and florid health. Mr. Anthony Car|li&s;le, &s;urgeon, of Soho-&s;quare, whom to name is &s;ufficiently to honour, had promi&s;ed to revi&s;e her production. This is but one out of numerous pro|jects of activity and u&s;efulne&s;s, which her untimely death has fatally termi|nated.</P>
<P>The ru&s;tic &s;ituation in which Mary &s;pent her infancy, no doubt contributed to confirm the &s;tamina of her con&s;ti|tution. She &s;ported in the open air, and amid&s;t the picture&s;que and refre&s;h|ing &s;cenes of nature, for which &s;he always retained the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite re|li&s;h. Dolls and the other amu&s;ements u&s;ually appropriated to female chil|dren,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
&s;he held in contempt; and felt a much greater propen&s;ity to join in the active and hardy &s;ports of her brothers, than to confine her&s;elf to tho&s;e of her own &s;ex.</P>
<P>About the time that Mary completed the fifth year of her age, her father removed to a &s;mall di&s;tance from his former habitation, and took a farm near the Whalebone upon Epping Fore&s;t, a little way out of the Chelm&s;|ford road. In Michaelmas 1765, he once more changed his re&s;idence, and occupied a convenient hou&s;e behind the town of Barking in E&s;&s;ex, eight miles from London. In this &s;ituation &s;ome of their neare&s;t neighbours were, Bamber Ga&s;coyne, e&s;quire, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively member of parliament for &s;everal bo|roughs, and his brother, Mr. Jo&s;eph Ga&s;coyne. Bamber Ga&s;coyne re&s;ided
<PB N="14" REF="17">
but little on this &s;pot; but his brother was almo&s;t a con&s;tant inhabitant, and his family in habits of the mo&s;t frequent intercour&s;e with the family of Mary. Here Mr. Woll&s;tonecraft remained for three years. In September 1796, I accompanied my wife in a vi&s;it to this &s;pot. No per&s;on reviewed with greater &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;cenes of her childhood. We found the hou&s;e uninhabited, and the garden in a wild and ruinous &s;tate. She renewed her acquaintance with the market-place, the &s;treets, and the wharf, the latter of which we found crowded with barges, and full of acti|vity.</P>
<P>In Michaelmas 1768, Mr. Woll&s;tone|craft again removed to a farm near Beverley in York&s;hire. Here the fa|mily remained for &s;ix years, and con&s;e|quently, Mary did not quit this re&s;i|dence,
<PB N="15" REF="18">
till &s;he had attained the age of fifteen years and five months. The principal part of her &s;chool-education pa&s;&s;ed during this period; but it was not to any advantage of infant litera|ture, that &s;he was indebted for her &s;ub&s;equent eminence; her education in this re&s;pect was merely &s;uch, as was afforded by the day-&s;chools of the place, in which &s;he re&s;ided. To her recollections Beverley appeared a very hand&s;ome town, &s;urrounded by genteel families, and with a brilliant a&s;&s;embly. She was &s;urprized, when &s;he vi&s;ited it in 1795, upon her voyage to Norway, to find the reality &s;o very much below the picture in her imagination.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Woll&s;tonecraft had been a farmer; but the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition would not &s;uffer him to content him&s;elf with the occupation
<PB N="16" REF="19">
in which for &s;ome years he had been engaged, and the temptation of a com|mercial &s;peculation of &s;ome &s;ort being held out to him, he removed to a hou&s;e in Queen's-Row, in Hoxton near Lon|don, for the purpo&s;e of its execution. Here he remained for a year and a half; but, being fru&s;trated in his expec|tations of profit, he, after that term gave up the project in which he was engaged, and returned to his former pur&s;uits. During this re&s;idence at Hoxton, the writer of the&s;e memoirs inhabited, as a &s;tudent, at the di&s;&s;enting college in that place. It is perhaps a que&s;tion of curious &s;peculation to enquire, what would have been the amount of the difference in the pur|&s;uits and enjoyments of each party, if they had met, and con&s;idered each other with the &s;ame di&s;tingui&s;hing regard in
<PB N="17" REF="20">
1776, as they were afterwards im|pre&s;&s;ed with in the year 1796. The writer had then completed the twen|tieth, and Mary the &s;eventeenth year of her age. Which would have been predominant; the di&s;advantages of ob&s;curity, and the pre&s;&s;ure of a family; or the gratifications and improvement that might have flowed from their in|tercour&s;e?</P>
<P>One of the acquaintances Mary formed at this time was with a Mr. Clare, who inhabited the next hou&s;e to that which was tenanted by her father, and to whom &s;he was pro|bably in &s;ome degree indebted for the early cultivation of her mind. Mr. Clare was a clergyman, and appears to have been a humouri&s;t of a very &s;in|gular ca&s;t. In his per&s;on he was de|formed and delicate; and his figure,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
I am told, bore a re&s;emblance to that of the celebrated Pope. He had a fondne&s;s for poetry, and was not de&s;ti|ture of ta&s;te. His manners were ex|pre&s;&s;ive of a tenderne&s;s and benevo|lence, the demon&s;trations of which appeared to have been &s;omewhat too artificially cultivated. His habits were tho&s;e of a perfect reclu&s;e. He &s;eldom went out of his drawing-room, and he &s;howed to a friend of Mary a pair of &s;hoes, which had &s;erved him, he &s;aid, for fourteen years. Mary frequently &s;pent days and weeks together, at the hou&s;e of Mr. Clare.</P>

<P>BUT a connection more memorable originated about this time, between Mary and a per&s;on of her own &s;ex, for whom &s;he contracted a friend&s;hip &s;o fervent, as for years to have con&s;tituted the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of her mind. The name of this per&s;on was Frances Blood; &s;he was two years older than Mary. Her re&s;idence was at that time at Newington Butts, a village near the
<PB N="20" REF="23">
&s;outhern extremity of the metropolis; and the original in&s;trument for bringing the&s;e two friends acquainted, was Mrs. Clare, wife of the gentleman already mentioned, who was on a footing of con&s;iderable intimacy with both par|ties. The acquaintance of Fanny, like that of Mr. Clare, contributed to ripen the immature talents of Mary.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in which Mary was introduced to her, bore a re&s;emblance to the fir&s;t interview of Werter with Charlotte. She was conducted to the door of a &s;mall hou&s;e, but furni&s;hed with peculiar neatne&s;s and propriety. The fir&s;t object that caught her &s;ight, was a young woman of a &s;lender and elegant form, and eighteen years of age, bu&s;ily employed in feeding and managing &s;ome children, born of the &s;ame parents, but con&s;iderably inferior
<PB N="21" REF="24">
to her in age. The impre&s;&s;ion Mary received from this &s;pectacle was inde|lible; and, before the interview was concluded, &s;he had taken, in her heart, the vows of an eternal friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Fanny was a young woman of extra|ordinary accompli&s;hments. She &s;ung and played with ta&s;te. She drew with exqui&s;ite fidelity and neatne&s;s; and, by the employment of this talent, for &s;ome time maintained her father, mother, and family, but ultimately ruined her health by her extraordinary exer|tions. She read and wrote with con&s;i|derable application; and the &s;ame ideas of minute and delicate propriety fol|lowed her in the&s;e, as in her other occupations.</P>
<P>Mary, a wild, but animated and a&s;piring girl of &s;ixteen, contemplated Fanny, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, with &s;enti|ments
<PB N="22" REF="25">
of inferiority and reverence, Though they were much together, yet, the di&s;tance of their habitation being con&s;iderable, they &s;upplied the want of more frequent interviews by an a&s;&s;i|duous corre&s;pondence. Mary found Fanny's letters better &s;pelt and better indited than her own, and felt her&s;elf aba&s;hed. She had hitherto paid but a &s;uperficial attention to literature. She had read, to gratify the ardour of an inextingui&s;hable thir&s;t of knowledge; but &s;he had not thought of writing as an art. Her ambition to excel was now awakened, and &s;he applied her|&s;elf with pa&s;&s;ion and earne&s;tne&s;s. Fanny undertook to be her in&s;tructor; and, &s;o far as related to accuracy and method, her le&s;&s;ons were given with con&s;ide|rable &s;kill.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">
It has already been mentioned that, in the &s;pring of the year 1776, Mr. Woll&s;tonecraft quitted his &s;ituation at Hoxton, and returned to his former agricultural pur&s;uits. The &s;ituation upon which he now fixed was in Wales, a circum&s;tance that was felt as a &s;evere blow to Mary's darling &s;pirit of friend&s;hip. The principal acquaint|ance of the Woll&s;tonecrafts in this re|tirement, was the family of a Mr. Allen, two of who&s;e daughters are &s;ince married to the two elder &s;ons of the celebrated Engli&s;h potter, Jo&s;iah Wedgwood.</P>
<P>Wales however was Mr. Woll&s;tone|craft's re&s;idence for little more than a year. He returned to the neighbour|hood of London; and Mary, who&s;e &s;pirit of independence was unalterable, had influence enough to determine his
<PB N="24" REF="27">
choice in favour of the village of Wal|worth, that &s;he might be near her cho&s;en friend. It was probably before this, that &s;he has once or twice &s;tarted the idea of quitting her parental roof, and providing for her&s;elf. But &s;he was prevailed upon to re&s;ign this idea, and conditions were &s;tipulated with her, relative to her having an apart|ment in the hou&s;e that &s;hould be ex|clu&s;ively her own, and her commanding the other requi&s;ites of &s;tudy. She did not however think her&s;elf fairly treated in the&s;e in&s;tances, and either the con|ditions abovementioned, or &s;ome others, were not ob&s;erved in the &s;equel, with the fidelity &s;he expected. In one ca&s;e, &s;he had procured an eligible &s;ituation, and every thing was &s;ettled re&s;pecting her removal to it, when the intreaties and tears of her mother led her to &s;ur|render
<PB N="25" REF="28">
her own inclinations, and aban|don the engagement.</P>
<P>The&s;e however were only temporary delays. Her propen&s;ities continued the &s;ame, and the motives by which &s;he was in&s;tigated were unabated. In the year 1778, &s;he being nineteen years of age, a propo&s;al was made to her of living as a companion with a Mrs. Daw&s;on of Bath, a widow lady, with one &s;on already adult. Upon en|quiry &s;he found that Mrs. Daw&s;on was a woman of great peculiarity of tem|per, that &s;he had had a variety of com|panions in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that no one had found it practicable to continue with her. Mary was not di&s;couraged by this information, and accepted the &s;ituation, with a re&s;olution that &s;he would effect in this re&s;pect, what none of her predece&s;&s;ors had been able to
<PB N="26" REF="29">
do. In the &s;equel &s;he had rea&s;on to con&s;ider the account &s;he had received as &s;ufficiently accurate, but &s;he did not relax in her endeavours. By method, con&s;tancy and firmne&s;s, &s;he found the means of making her &s;ituation tole|rable; and Mrs. Daw&s;on would occa|&s;ionally confe&s;s, that Mary was the only per&s;on that had lived with her in that &s;ituation, in her treatment of whom &s;he had felt her&s;elf under any re&s;traint.</P>
<P>With Mrs. Daw&s;on &s;he continued to re&s;ide for two years, and only left her, &s;ummoned by the melancholy circum|&s;tance of her mother's rapidly declining health. True to the calls of humanity, Mary felt in this intelligence an irre|&s;i&s;tible motive, and eagerly returned to the paternal roof, which &s;he had before re&s;olutely quitted. The re&s;idence of her father at this time, was at Enfield
<PB N="27" REF="30">
near London. He had, I believe, given up agriculture from the time of his quitting Wales, it appearing that he now made it le&s;s a &s;ource of profit than lo&s;s, and being thought advi&s;able that he &s;hould rather live upon the intere&s;t of his property already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The illne&s;s of Mrs. Woll&s;tonecraft was lingering, but hopele&s;s. Mary was a&s;&s;iduous in her attendance upon her mother. At fir&s;t, every attention was received with acknowledgments and gratitude; but, as the attentions grew habitual, and the health of the mother more and more wretched, they were rather exacted, than received. Nothing would be taken by the unfor|tunate patient, but from the hands of Mary; re&s;t was denied night or day, and by the time nature was exhau&s;ted
<PB N="28" REF="31">
in the parent, the daughter was quali|fied to a&s;&s;ume her place, and become in turn her&s;elf a patient. The la&s;t words her mother ever uttered were, "A little patience, and all will be over!" and the&s;e words are repeatedly refer|red to by Mary in the cour&s;e of her writings.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Mrs. Woll&s;tone|craft, Mary bid a final adieu to the roof of her father. According to my memorandums, I find her next the in|mate of Fanny at Walham-Green, near the village of Fulham. Upon what plan they now lived together I am un|able to a&s;certain; certainly not that of Mary's becoming in any degree an ad|ditional burthen upon the indu&s;try of her friend. Thus &s;ituated, their inti|macy ripened; they approached more nearly to a footing of equality; and
<PB N="29" REF="32">
their attachment became more rooted and active.</P>
<P>Mary was ever ready at the call of di&s;tre&s;s, and, in particular, during her whole life was eager and active to pro|mote the welfare of every member of her family. In 1780 &s;he attended the death-bed of her mother; in 1782 &s;he was &s;ummoned by a not le&s;s melan|choly occa&s;ion, to attend her &s;i&s;ter Eliza, married to a Mr. Bi&s;hop, who, &s;ub&s;equently to a dangerous lying-in, remained for &s;ome months in a very af|flicting &s;ituation.

<P>MARY was now arrived at the twen|ty-fourth year of her age. Her project, five years before, had been per&s;onal independence; it was now u&s;efulne&s;s. In the &s;olitude of attendance on her &s;i&s;ter's illne&s;s, and during the &s;ub&s;e|quent convale&s;cence, &s;he had had lei|&s;ure to ruminate upon purpo&s;es of this &s;ort. Her expanded mind led her to &s;eek &s;omething more arduous than the mere removal of per&s;onal vexations;
<PB N="31" REF="34">
and the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart would not &s;uffer her to re&s;t in &s;olitary gratifi|cations. The derangement of her fa|ther's affairs daily became more and more glaring; and a &s;mall independent provi&s;ion made for her&s;elf and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ters, appears to have been &s;acrificed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the wreck. For ten years, from 1782 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> 1792, &s;he may be &s;aid to have been, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> a great degree, the victim of a de&s;ire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> promote the benefit of others. She did not fore&s;ee the &s;evere di&s;appoint|ment with which an exclu&s;ive purpo&s;e of this &s;ort is pregnant; &s;he was inex|perienced enough to lay a &s;tre&s;s upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equent gratitude of tho&s;e &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">enefited; and &s;he did not &s;ufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;ider that, in proportion as we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">volve our&s;elves in the intere&s;ts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ociety of others, we acquire a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">xqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of their defects, and are

tormented with their untractablene&s;s and folly.</P>
<P>The project upon which &s;he now determined, was no other than that of a day-&s;chool, to be &s;uperintended by Fanny Blood, her&s;elf, and her two &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>They accordingly opened one in the year 1783, at the village of I&s;lington but in the cour&s;e of a few months re|moved it to Newington Green. Her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mary formed &s;ome acquaintances who influenced the future events of her life. The fir&s;t of the&s;e in her own e&s;timation was Dr. Richard Price, well known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> his political and mathematical calcu|lations, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e who knew him, for the &s;implicit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his manners, and the ardour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> benevolence. The regard conceive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the&s;e two per&s;ons for each other
<PB N="33" REF="36">
was mutual, and partook of a &s;pirit of the pure&s;t attachment. Mary had been bred in the principles of the church of England, but her e&s;teem for this vene|rable preacher led her occa&s;ionally to attend upon his public in&s;tructions. Her religion was, in reality, little allied to any &s;y&s;tem of forms; and, as &s;he has often told me, was founded rather in ta&s;te, than in the niceties of polemical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Her mind con&s;titutionally attached it&s;elf to the &s;ublime and the amiable. She found an inexpre&s;&s;ible delight in the beauties of nature, and in the &s;plendid reveries of the imagi|nation. But nature it&s;elf, &s;he thought, would be no better than a va&s;t blank, if the mind of the ob&s;erver did not &s;upply it with an animating &s;oul. When &s;he walked amid&s;t the wonders of nature, &s;he was accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="37">
with her God. To her mind he was pictured as not le&s;s amiable, generous and kind, than great, wi&s;e and exalted In fact, &s;he had received few le&s;&s;ons of religion in her youth, and her religion was almo&s;t entirely of her own crea|tion. But &s;he was not on that account the le&s;s attached to it, or the le&s;s &s;cru|pulous in di&s;charging what &s;he con&s;i|dered as its duties. She could not recollect the time when &s;he had be|lieved the doctrine of future puni&s;h|ments. The tenets of her &s;y&s;tem were the growth of her own mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ta&s;te, and her religion therefore had always been a gratification, never a terror, to her. She expected a future &s;tate; but &s;he would not allow her ideas of that future &s;tate to be modified, by the notions of judgment and retri|bution. From this &s;ketch, it is &s;uffi|ciently <PB N="35" REF="38">
evident, that the plea&s;ure &s;he took in an occa&s;ional attendance upon the &s;ermons of Dr. Price, was not ac|companied with a &s;uper&s;titious ad|herence to his doctrines. The fact is, that, as far down as the year 1787, &s;he regularly frequented public wor&s;hip, for the mo&s;t part according to the forms of the church of England. After that period her attendance became le&s;s con&s;tant, and in no long time was wholly di&s;continued. I believe it may be admitted as a maxim, that no per|&s;on of a well furni&s;hed mind, that has &s;haken off the implicit &s;ubjection of youth, and is not the zealous partizan of a &s;ect, can bring him&s;elf to conform to the public and regular routine of &s;ermons and prayers.</P>
<P>Another of the friends &s;he acquired at this period, was Mrs. Burgh, widow
<PB N="36" REF="39">
of the author of the Political Di&s;qui&s;i|tions, a woman univer&s;ally well &s;poken of for the warmth and purity of her benevolence. Mary, whenever &s;he had occa&s;ion to allude to her, to the la&s;t period of her life, paid the tribute due to her virtues. The only remaining friend nece&s;&s;ary to be enumerated in this place, is the rev. John Hewlet, now ma&s;ter of a boarding-&s;chool at Shacklewel near Hackney, whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention here|after.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that Fanny's health had been materially injured by her ince&s;&s;ant labours for the mainte|nance of her family. She had al&s;o &s;uf|fered a di&s;appointment, which preyed upon her mind. To the&s;e different &s;ources of ill health &s;he became gradu|ally a victim; and at length di&s;covered
<PB N="37" REF="40">
all the &s;ymptoms of a pulmonary con|&s;umption. By the medical men that attended her, &s;he was advi&s;ed to try the effects of a &s;outhern climate; and, about the beginning of the year 1785, &s;ailed for Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t feeling with which Mary had contemplated her friend, was a &s;entiment of inferiority and reverence; but that, from the operation of a ten years' acquaintance, was con&s;iderably changed. Fanny had originally been far before her in literary attainments; this di&s;parity no longer exi&s;ted. In whatever degree Mary might endea|vour to free her&s;elf from the delu&s;ions of &s;elf-e&s;teem, this period of ob&s;erva|tion upon her own mind and that of her friend, could not pa&s;s, without her perceiving that there were &s;ome e&s;&s;en|tial characteri&s;tics of genius, which &s;he

<PB N="37" REF="42">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="38" REF="43">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and in which her friend was deficient. The principal of the&s;e was a firmne&s;s of mind, an unconquerable greatne&s;s of &s;oul, by which, after a &s;hort internal &s;truggle, &s;he was accu&s;|tomed to ri&s;e above difficulties and &s;uffering. Whatever Mary undertook, &s;he perhaps in all in&s;tances accom|pli&s;hed; and, to her lofty &s;pirit, &s;carcely any thing &s;he de&s;ired, appeared hard to perform. Fanny, on the contrary, was a woman of a timid and irre&s;olute na|ture, accu&s;tomed to yield to difficulties, and probably priding her&s;elf in this morbid &s;oftne&s;s of her temper. One in&s;tance that I have heard Mary relate of this &s;ort, was, that, at a certain time, Fanny, di&s;&s;atisfied with her dome&s;tic &s;ituation, expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to have a home of her own. Mary, who felt nothing more pre&s;&s;ing than to re|lieve
<PB N="39" REF="44">
the inconveniences of her friend, determined to accompli&s;h this object for her. It co&s;t her infinite exertions; but at length &s;he was able to announce to Fanny that a hou&s;e was prepared, and that &s;he was on the &s;pot to receive her. The an&s;wer which Fanny re|turned to the letter of her friend, con|&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t wholly of an enumeration of objections to the quitting her family, which &s;he had not thought of before, but which now appeared to her of con|&s;iderable weight.</P>
<P>The judgment which experience had taught Mary to form of the mind of her friend, determined her in the advice &s;he gave, at the period to which I have brought down the &s;tory. Fanny was recommended to &s;eek a &s;ofter climate, but &s;he had no funds to defray the ex|pence of &s;uch an undertaking. At this
<PB N="40" REF="45">
time Mr. Hugh Skeys of Dublin, but then re&s;ident in the kingdom of Portu|gal, paid his addre&s;&s;es to her. The &s;tate of her health Mary con&s;idered as &s;uch as &s;carcely to afford the &s;hadow of a hope; it was not therefore a time at which it was mo&s;t obvious to think of marriage. She conceived however that nothing &s;hould be omitted, which might alleviate, if it could not cure; and accordingly urged her &s;peedy ac|ceptance of the propo&s;al. Fanny ac|cordingly made the voyage to Li&s;bon; and the marriage took place on the twenty-fourth of February 1785.</P>
<P>The change of climate and &s;ituation was productive of little benefit; and the life of Fanny was only prolonged by a period of pregnancy, which &s;oon de|clared it&s;elf. Mary, in the mean time, was impre&s;&s;ed with the idea that her
<PB N="41" REF="46">
friend would die in this di&s;tant country; and, &s;hocked with the recollection of her &s;eparation from the circle of her friends, determined to pa&s;s over to Li&s;bon to attend her. This re&s;olution was treated by her acquaintance as in the utmo&s;t degree vi&s;ionary; but &s;he was not to be diverted from her point. She had not money to defray her ex|pences: &s;he mu&s;t quit for a long time the &s;chool, the very exi&s;tence of which probably depended upon her exer|tions.</P>
<P>No per&s;on was ever better formed for the bu&s;ine&s;s of education; if it be not a &s;ort of ab&s;urdity to &s;peak of a per&s;on as formed for an inferior object, who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of talents, in the fulle&s;t degree adequate to &s;omething on a more important and comprehen&s;ive &s;cale. Mary had a quickne&s;s of tem|per,
<PB N="42" REF="47">
not apt to take offence with inad|vertencies, but which led her to ima|gine that &s;he &s;aw the mind of the per&s;on with whom &s;he had any tran&s;|action, and to refer the principle of her approbation or di&s;plea&s;ure to the cordiality or inju&s;tice of their &s;enti|ments. She was occa&s;ionally &s;evere and imperious in her re&s;entments; and, when &s;he &s;trongly di&s;approved, was apt to expre&s;s her cen&s;ure in terms that gave a very humiliating &s;en&s;ation to the per&s;on again&s;t whom it was di|rected. Her di&s;plea&s;ure however never a&s;&s;umed its &s;evere&s;t form, but when it was barbed by di&s;appointment. Where &s;he expected little, &s;he was not very rigid in her cen&s;ure of error.</P>
<P>But, to whatever the defects of her temper might amount, they were never exerci&s;ed upon her inferiors in &s;tation
<PB N="43" REF="48">
or age. She &s;corned to make u&s;e of an ungenerous advantage, or to wound the defencele&s;s. To her &s;ervants there never was a mi&s;tre&s;s more con&s;iderate or more kind. With children &s;he was the mirror of patience. Perhaps, in all her exten&s;ive experience upon the &s;ubject of education, &s;he never be|trayed one &s;ymptom of ira&s;cibility. Her heart was the &s;eat of every benevolent feeling; and accordingly, in all her intercour&s;e with children, it was kind|ne&s;s and &s;ympathy alone that prompted her conduct. Sympathy, when it mounts to a certain height, inevitably begets affection in the per&s;on towards whom it is exerci&s;ed; and I have heard her &s;ay, that &s;he never was concerned in the education of one child, who was not per&s;onally attached to her, and earne&s;tly concerned not to incur her
<PB N="44" REF="49">
di&s;plea&s;ure. Another eminent advan|tage &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of education, was that &s;he was little trou|bled with &s;ceptici&s;m and uncertainty. She &s;aw, as it were by intuition, the path which her mind determined to pur&s;ue, and had a firm confidence in her own power to effect what &s;he de|&s;ired. Yet, with all this, &s;he had &s;carcely a tincture of ob&s;tinacy. She carefully watched &s;ymptoms as they ro&s;e, and the &s;ucce&s;s of her experi|ments; and governed her&s;elf accord|ingly. While I thus enumerate her more than maternal qualities, it is im|po&s;&s;ible not to feel a pang at the recol|lection of her orphan children!</P>
<P>Though her friends earne&s;tly di&s;|&s;uaded her from the journey to Li&s;bon, &s;he found among them a willing|ne&s;s
<PB N="45" REF="50">
to facilitate the execution of her project, when it was once fixed. Mrs. Burgh in particular, &s;upplied her with money, which however &s;he always con|ceived came from Dr. Price. This loan, I have rea&s;on to believe, was faithfully repaid.</P>
<P>It was during her re&s;idence at New|ington Green, that &s;he was introduced to the acquaintance of Dr. John&s;on, who was at that time con&s;idered as in &s;ome &s;ort the father of Engli&s;h litera|ture. The doctor treated her with particular kindne&s;s and attention, had a long conver&s;ation with her, and de|&s;ired her to repeat her vi&s;it often. This &s;he firmly purpo&s;ed to do; but the news of his la&s;t illne&s;s, and then of his death, intervened to prevent her mak|ing a &s;econd vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="51">
Her re&s;idence in Li&s;bon was not long. She arrived but a &s;hort time before her friend was prematurely de|livered, and the event was fatal to both mother and child. Frances Blood, hitherto the cho&s;en object of Mary's attachment, died on the twenty-ninth of November 1785.</P>
<P>It is thus that &s;he &s;peaks of her in her Letters from Norway, written ten years after her decea&s;e. "When a warm heart has received &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, they are not to be effaced. Emotions become &s;entiments; and the imagination ren|ders even tran&s;ient &s;en&s;ations perma|nent, by fondly retracing them. I cannot, without a thrill of delight, re|collect views I have &s;een, which are not to be forgotten, nor looks I have felt in every nerve, which I &s;hall never
<PB N="47" REF="52">
more meet. The grave has clo&s;ed over a dear friend, the friend of my youth; &s;till &s;he is pre&s;ent with me, and I hear her &s;oft voice warbling as I &s;tray over the heath."</P>

<P>No doubt the voyage to Li&s;bon tended con&s;iderably to enlarge the under&s;tanding of Mary. She was ad|mitted into the be&s;t company the Engli&s;h factory afforded. She made many profound ob&s;ervations on the character of the natives, and the bale|ful effects of &s;uper&s;tition. The ob|&s;equies of Fanny, which it was nece&s;|&s;ary to perform by &s;tealth and in dark|ne&s;s, <PB N="49" REF="54">
tended to invigorate the&s;e ob&s;er|vations in her mind.</P>
<P>She &s;ailed upon her voyage home about the twentieth of December. On this occa&s;ion a circum&s;tance occurred, that de&s;erves to be record|ed. While they were on their pa&s;|&s;age, they fell in with a French ve&s;|&s;el, in great di&s;tre&s;s, and in daily expec|tation of foundering at &s;ea, at the &s;ame time that it was almo&s;t de&s;titute of provi&s;ions. The Frenchman hailed them, and intreated the Engli&s;h cap|tain, in con&s;ideration of his melancholy &s;ituation, to take him and his crew on board. The Engli&s;hman repre&s;ented in reply, that his &s;tock of provi&s;ions was by no means adequate to &s;uch an additional number of mouths, and ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed compliance. Mary, &s;hocked at his apparent in&s;en&s;ibility, took up the cau&s;e of the &s;ufferers, and
<PB N="50" REF="55">
threatened the captain to have him called to a &s;evere account, when he arrived in England. She finally pre|vailed, and had the &s;atisfaction to re|flect, that the per&s;ons in que&s;tion po&s;&s;ibly owed their lives to her inter|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived in England, &s;he &s;ound that her &s;chool had &s;uffered con|&s;iderably in her ab&s;ence. It can be little reproach to any one, to &s;ay that they were found incapable of &s;upply|ing her place. She not only excelled in the management of the children, but had al&s;o the talent of being attentive and obliging to the parents, without degrading her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The period at which I am now ar|rived is important, as conducting to the fir&s;t &s;tep of her literary carreer. Mr. Hewlet had frequently mentioned
<PB N="51" REF="56">
literature to Mary as a certain &s;ource of pecuniary produce, and had urged her to make trial of the truth of his judgment. At this time &s;he was de|&s;irous of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the father and mother of Fanny in an object they had in view, the tran&s;porting them&s;elves to Ireland; and, as u&s;ual, what &s;he de&s;ired in a pecuniary view, &s;he was ready to take on her&s;elf to effect. For this purpo&s;e &s;he wrote a duodecimo pamphlet of one hundred and &s;ixty pages, entitled, Thoughts on the Education of Daugh|ters. Mr. Hewlet obtained from the book&s;eller, Mr. John&s;on in St. Paul's Church Yard, ten guineas for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">py-right of this manu&s;cript, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> immediately applied to the object for the &s;ake of which the pamphlet was written.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="57">
Every thing urged Mary to put an end to the affair of the &s;chool. She was di&s;&s;atisfied with the different ap|pearance it pre&s;ented upon her return, from the &s;tate in which &s;he left it. Experience impre&s;&s;ed upon her a rooted aver&s;ion to that &s;ort of cohabi|tation with her &s;i&s;ters, which the pro|ject of the &s;chool impo&s;ed. Cohabi|tation is a point of delicate experi|ment, and is, in a majority of in&s;tances, pregnant with ill-humour and unhap|pine&s;s. The activity and ardent &s;pirit of adventure which characterized Mary, were not felt in an equal degree by her &s;i&s;ters, &s;o that a di&s;proportionate &s;hare of every burthen attendant upon the &s;ituation, fell to her lot. On the other hand, they could &s;carcely per|haps be perfectly ea&s;y, in ob&s;erving the &s;uperior degree of deference and court|&s;hip,
<PB N="53" REF="58">
which her merit extorted from almo&s;t every one that knew her. Her kindne&s;s for them was not dimini&s;hed, but &s;he re&s;olved that the mode of its exertion in future &s;hould be different, tending to their benefit, without in|trenching upon her own liberty.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, a propo&s;al was made her, &s;uch as, regarding only the &s;ituations through which &s;he had lately pa&s;&s;ed, is u&s;ually termed advan|tageous. This was, to accept the office of governe&s;s to the daughters of lord vi&s;count King&s;borough, elde&s;t &s;on to the earl of King&s;ton of the kingdom of Ireland. The terms held out to her were &s;uch as &s;he determined to accept, at the &s;ame time re&s;olving to retain the &s;ituation only for a &s;hort time. Inde|pendence was the object after which &s;he thir&s;ted, and &s;he was fixed to try
<PB N="54" REF="59">
whether it might not be found in lite|rary occupation. She was de&s;irous however fir&s;t to accumulate a &s;mall &s;um of money, which &s;hould enable her to con&s;ider at lei&s;ure the different lite|rary engagements that might offer, and provide in &s;ome degree for the even|tual deficiency of her earlie&s;t attempts.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in the family of lord King&s;borough, was offered to her through the medium of the rev. Mr. Prior, at that time one of the under ma&s;ters of Eton &s;chool. She &s;pent &s;ome time at the hou&s;e of this gentle|man, immediately after her giving up the &s;chool at Newington Green. Here &s;he had an opportunity of making an accurate ob&s;ervation upon the man|ners and conduct of that celebrated &s;eminary, and the ideas &s;he retained of it were by no means favourable. By
<PB N="55" REF="60">
all that &s;he &s;aw, &s;he was confirmed in a very favourite opinion of her's, in be|half of day-&s;chools, where, as &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed it, "children have the opportu|nity of conver&s;ing with children, without interfering with dome&s;tic affections, the foundation of virtue."</P>
<P>Though her re&s;idence in the family of lord King&s;borough continued &s;carcely more than twelve months, &s;he left be|hind her, with them and their connec|tions, a very advantageous impre&s;&s;ion. The governe&s;&s;es the young ladies had hitherto had, were only a &s;pecies of upper &s;ervants, controlled in every thing by the mother; Mary in&s;i&s;ted upon the unbounded exerci&s;e of her own di&s;cretion. When the young ladies heard of their governe&s;s coming from England, they heard in imagina|tion of a new enemy, and declared
<PB N="56" REF="61">
their re&s;olution to guard them&s;elves accordingly. Mary however &s;peedily &s;ucceeded in gaining their confidence, and the friend&s;hip that &s;oon grew up between her and Margaret King, now counte&s;s Mount Ca&s;hel, the elde&s;t daughter, was in an uncommon degree cordial and affectionate. Mary always &s;poke of this young lady in terms of the true&s;t applau&s;e, both in relation to the eminence of her intellectual pow|ers, and the ingenuous amiablene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition. Lady King&s;borough, from the be&s;t motives, had impo&s;ed upon her daughters a variety of prohi|bitions, both as to the books they &s;hould read, and in many other re&s;pects. The&s;e prohibitions had their u&s;ual ef|fects; inordinate de&s;ire for the things forbidden, and clande&s;tine indulgence&punc; Mary immediately re&s;tored the chil|dren
<PB N="57" REF="62">
to their liberty, and undertook to govern them by their affections only. The con&s;equence was, that their indul|gences were moderate, and they were unea&s;y under any indulgence that had not the &s;anction of their governe&s;s. The &s;alutary effects of the new &s;y&s;tem of education were &s;peedily vi&s;ible; and lady King&s;borough &s;oon felt no other unea&s;ine&s;s, than le&s;t the children &s;hould love their governe&s;s better than their mother.</P>
<P>Mary made many friends in Ireland, among the per&s;ons who vi&s;ited lord King&s;borough's hou&s;e, for &s;he always appeared there with the air of an equal, and not of a dependent. I have heard her mention the ludicrous di&s;|tre&s;s of a woman of quality, who&s;e name I have forgotten, that, in a large company, &s;ingled out Mary, and en|tered
<PB N="58" REF="63">
into a long conver&s;ation with her. After the conver&s;ation was over, &s;he enquired whom &s;he had been talk|ing with, and found, to her utter morti|fication and di&s;may, that it was Mi&s;s King's governe&s;s.</P>
<P>One of the per&s;ons among her Iri&s;h acquaintance, whom Mary was accu&s;|tomed to &s;peak of with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, was Mr. George Ogle, member of parliament for the county of Wex|ford. She held his talents in very high e&s;timation; &s;he was &s;trongly pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the goodne&s;s of his heart; and &s;he always &s;poke of him as the mo&s;t perfect gentleman &s;he had ever known. She felt the regret of a di&s;appointed friend, at the part he has lately taken in the politics of Ireland.</P>
<P>Lord King&s;borough's family pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer of the year 1787 at Bri&s;tol
<PB N="59" REF="64">
Hot-Wells, and had formed the project of proceeding from thence to the con|tinent, a tour in which Mary purpo&s;ed to accompany them. The plan how|ever was ultimately given up, and Mary in con&s;equence clo&s;ed her con|nection with them, earlier than &s;he otherwi&s;e had purpo&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>At Bri&s;tol Hot-Wells &s;he compo&s;ed the little book which bears the title of Mary, a Fiction. A con&s;iderable part of this &s;tory con&s;i&s;ts, with certain modi|fications, of the incidents of her own friend&s;hip with Fanny. All the events that do not relate to that &s;ubject are fictitious.</P>
<P>This little work, if Mary had never produced any thing el&s;e, would &s;erve, with per&s;ons of true ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibi|lity, to e&s;tabli&s;h the eminence of her genius. The &s;tory is nothing. He

that looks into the book only for inci|dent, will probably lay it down with di&s;gu&s;t. But the feelings are of the true&s;t and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite cla&s;s; every circum&s;tance is adorned with that &s;pecies of imagination, which enli&s;ts it&s;elf under the banners of delicacy and &s;entiment. A work of &s;entiment, as it is called, is too often another name for a work of affectation. He that &s;hould imagine that the &s;entiments of this book are affected, would indeed be entitled to our profounde&s;t commi|&s;eration.</P>

<P>BEING now determined to enter upon her literary plan, Mary came immediately from Bri&s;tol to the metro|polis. Her conduct under this circum|&s;tance was &s;uch as to do credit both to her own heart, and that of Mr. John|&s;on, her publi&s;her, between whom and her&s;elf there now commenced an inti|mate friend&s;hip. She had &s;een him
<PB N="62" REF="67">
upon occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing her Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, and &s;he addre&s;&s;ed two or three letters to him during her re&s;i|dence in Ireland. Upon her arrival in London in Augu&s;t 1787, &s;he went im|mediately to his hou&s;e, and frankly explained to him her purpo&s;e, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance as to its execution. After a &s;hort conver&s;ation, Mr. John&s;on invited her to make his hou&s;e her home, till &s;he &s;hould have &s;uited her&s;elf with a fixed re&s;idence. She accordingly re|&s;ided at this time two or three weeks under his roof. At the &s;ame period &s;he paid a vi&s;it or two of &s;imilar dura|tion to &s;ome friends, at no great di&s;|tance from the metropolis.</P>
<P>At Michaelmas 1787, &s;he entered upon a hou&s;e in George &s;treet, on the
<PB N="63" REF="68">
Surry &s;ide of Black Friar's Bridge, which Mr. John&s;on had provided for her during her excur&s;ion into the country. The three years immediately en&s;uing, may be &s;aid, in the ordinary accep|tation of the term, to have been the mo&s;t active period of her life. She brought with her to this habitation, the novel of Mary, which had not yet been &s;ent to the pre&s;s, and the commence|ment of a &s;ort of oriental tale, entitled, the Cave of Fancy, which &s;he thought proper afterwards to lay a&s;ide unfini&s;h|ed. I am told that at this period &s;he appeared under great dejection of &s;pi|rits, and filled with melancholy regret for the lo&s;s of her youthful friend. A period of two years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of that friend; but it was po&s;&s;ibly the compo&s;ition of the fiction of Mary, that renewed her &s;orrows in
<PB N="64" REF="69">
their original force. Soon after enter|ing upon her new habitation, &s;he pro|duced a little work, entitled, Original Stories from Real Life, intended for the u&s;e of children. At the commence|ment of her literary carreer, &s;he is &s;aid to have conceived a vehement aver&s;ion to the being regarded, by her ordinary acquaintance, in the character of an author, and to have employed &s;ome precautions to prevent its occurrence.</P>
<P>The employment which the book|&s;eller &s;ugge&s;ted to her, as the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t certain &s;ource of pecuniary income, of cour&s;e, was tran&s;lation. With this view &s;he improved her&s;elf in her French, with which &s;he had previ|ou&s;ly but a &s;light acquaintance, and ac|quired the Italian and German lan|guages. The greater part of her lite|rary engagements at this time, were
<PB N="65" REF="70">
&s;uch as were pre&s;ented to her by Mr. John&s;on. She new-modelled and abridged a work, tran&s;lated from the Dutch, entitled, Young Grandi&s;on: &s;he began a tran&s;lation from the French, of a book, called, the New Robin&s;on; but in this undertaking, &s;he was, I believe, anticipated by another tran&s;|lator: and &s;he compiled a &s;eries of ex|tracts in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, upon the model of Dr. Enfield's Speaker, which bears the title of the Female Reader; but which, from a cau&s;e not worth mentioning, has hitherto been printed with a different name in the title-page.</P>
<P>About the middle of the year 1788, Mr. John&s;on in&s;tituted the Analytical Review, in which Mary took a con&s;i|derable &s;hare. She al&s;o tran&s;lated Necker on the Importance of Religious Opi|nions; made an abridgment of Lavater's
<PB N="66" REF="71">
Phy&s;iognomy, from the French, which has never been publi&s;hed; and com|pre&s;&s;ed Salzmann's Elements of Mora|lity, a German production, into a pub|lication in three volumes duodecimo. The tran&s;lation of Salzmann produced a corre&s;pondence between Mary and the author; and he afterwards repaid the obligation to her in kind, by a German tran&s;lation of the Rights of Woman. Such were her principal li|terary occupations, from the autumn of 1787, to the autumn of 1790.</P>
<P>It perhaps de&s;erves to be remarked that this &s;ort of mi&s;cellaneous literary employment, &s;eems, for the time at lea&s;t, rather to damp and contract, than to enlarge and invigorate, the genius. The writer is accu&s;tomed to &s;ee his performances an&s;wer the mere mercantile purpo&s;e of the day, and
<PB N="67" REF="72">
confounded with tho&s;e of per&s;ons to whom he is &s;ecretly con&s;cious of a &s;uperiority. No neighbour mind &s;erves as a mirror to reflect the generous confidence he felt within him&s;elf; and perhaps the man never yet exi&s;ted, who could maintain his enthu&s;ia&s;m to its full vigour, in the mid&s;t of this kind of &s;olitarine&s;s. He is touched with the torpedo of mediocrity. I believe that nothing which Mary produced during this period, is marked with tho&s;e daring flights, which exhibit them&s;elves in the little fiction &s;he com|po&s;ed ju&s;t before its commencement. Among effu&s;ions of a nobler ca&s;t, I find occa&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;ed &s;ome of that homily-language, which, to &s;peak from my own feelings, is calculated to damp the moral courage, it was intended to
<PB N="68" REF="73">
awaken. This is probably to be a&s;|&s;igned to the cau&s;es above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that one of the purpo&s;es which Mary had conceived, a few years before, as nece&s;&s;ary to give a reli&s;h to the otherwi&s;e in&s;ipid, or em|bittered, draught of human life, was u&s;efulne&s;s. On this &s;ide, the period of her exi&s;tence of which I am now treat|ing, is more brilliant, than in a literary view. She determined to apply as great a part as po&s;&s;ible of the produce of her pre&s;ent employments, to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of her friends and of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed; and, for this purpo&s;e, laid down to her&s;elf rules of the mo&s;t rigid economy. She began with endeavour|ing to promote the intere&s;t of her &s;i&s;|ters. She conceived that there was no &s;ituation in which &s;he could place them, at once &s;o re&s;pectable and agree|able,
<PB N="69" REF="74">
as that of governe&s;&s;es in private families. She determined therefore in the fir&s;t place, to endeavour to qualify them for &s;uch an undertaking. Her younger &s;i&s;ter &s;he &s;ent to Paris, where &s;he remained near two years. The elder &s;he placed in a &s;chool near Lon|don, fir&s;t as a parlour-boarder, and af|terwards as a teacher. Her brother James, who had already been at &s;ea, &s;he fir&s;t took into her hou&s;e, and next &s;ent to Woolwich for in&s;truction, to qualify him for a re&s;pectable &s;ituation in the royal navy, where he was &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ly after made a lieutenant. Charles, who was her favourite brother, had been articled to the elde&s;t, an attorney in the Minories; but, not being &s;atis|fied with his &s;ituation, &s;he removed him; and in &s;ome time after, having fir&s;t placed him with a farmer for in|&s;truction,
<PB N="70" REF="75">
&s;he fitted him out for Ame|rica, where his &s;peculations, founded upon the ba&s;is &s;he had provided, are &s;aid to have been extremely pro&s;per|ous. The rea&s;on &s;o much of this pa|rental &s;ort of care fell upon her, was, that her father had by this time con|&s;iderably embarra&s;&s;ed his circum&s;tances. His affairs having grown too complex for him&s;elf to di&s;entangle, he had in|tru&s;ted them to the management of a near relation; but Mary, not being &s;atisfied with the conduct of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, took them into her own hands. The exertions &s;he made, and the &s;trug|gle into which &s;he entered however, in this in&s;tance, were ultimately fruit|le&s;s. To the day of her death her fa|ther was almo&s;t wholly &s;upported by funds which &s;he &s;upplied to him. In addition to her exertions for her own
<PB N="93" REF="76">
family, &s;he took a young girl of about &s;even years of age under her protec|tion and care, the niece of Mrs. John Hunter, and of the pre&s;ent Mrs. Skeys, for who&s;e mother, then lately dead, &s;he had entertained a &s;incere friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>The period, from the end of the year 1787 to the end of the year 1790, though con&s;umed in labours of little eclat, &s;erved &s;till further to e&s;tabli&s;h her in a friendly connec|tion from which &s;he derived many plea&s;ures. Mr. John&s;on, the book&s;eller, contracted a great per&s;onal regard for her, which re&s;embled in many re&s;pects that of a parent. As &s;he frequented his hou&s;e, &s;he of cour&s;e became ac|quainted with his gue&s;ts. Among the&s;e may be mentioned as per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her e&s;teem, Mr. Bonnyca&s;tle,
<PB N="72" REF="77">
the mathematician, the late Mr. George Ander&s;on, accountant to the board of control, Dr. George Fordyce, and Mr. Fu&s;eli, the celebrated painter. Between both of the two latter and her&s;elf, there exi&s;ted &s;entiments of ge|nuine affection and friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>HITHERTO the literary carreer of Mary, had for the mo&s;t part, been &s;ilent; and had been productive of income to her&s;elf, without apparently leading to the wreath of fame. From this time &s;he was de&s;tined to attract the notice of the public, and perhaps no female writer ever obtained &s;o great a degree of celebrity throughout Europe.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted that, while,
<PB N="74" REF="79">
for three years of literary employment, &s;he "held the noi&s;ele&s;s tenor of her way," her mind was in&s;en&s;ibly advanc|ing towards a vigorous maturity. The uninterrupted habit of compo&s;ition gave a freedom and firmne&s;s to the expre&s;|&s;ion of her &s;entiments. The &s;ociety &s;he frequented, nouri&s;hed her under|&s;tanding, and enlarged her mind. The French revolution, while it gave a fun|damental &s;hock to the human intellect through every region of the globe, did not fail to produce a con&s;picuous ef|fect in the progre&s;s of Mary's reflec|tions. The prejudices of her early years &s;uffered a vehement concu&s;|&s;ion. Her re&s;pect for e&s;tabli&s;hments was undermined. At this period oc|curred a mi&s;under&s;tanding upon pub|lic grounds, with one of her early friends, who&s;e attachment to mu&s;ty
<PB N="75" REF="80">
creeds and exploded ab&s;urdities, had been increa&s;ed, by the operation of tho&s;e very circum&s;tances, by which her mind had been rapidly advanced in the race of independence.</P>
<P>The event, immediately introductory to the rank which from this time &s;he held in the li&s;ts of literature, was the publication of Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. This book, after having been long promi&s;ed to the world, finally made its appearance on the fir&s;t of November 1790; and Mary, full of &s;entiments of liberty, and impre&s;&s;ed with a warm intere&s;t in the &s;truggle that was now going on, &s;eiz+ed her pen in the fir&s;t bur&s;t of indig|nation, an emotion of which &s;he was &s;trongly &s;u&s;ceptible. She was in the habit of compo&s;ing with rapidity, and her an&s;wer, which was the fir&s;t of the
<PB N="76" REF="81">
numerous ones that appeared, obtain|ed extraordinary notice. Marked as it is with the vehemence and impetu|ou&s;ne&s;s of its eloquence, it is certainly chargeable with a too contemptuous and intemperate treatment of the great man again&s;t whom its attack is direct|ed. But this circum&s;tance was not injurious to the &s;ucce&s;s of the publi|cation. Burke had been warmly loved by the mo&s;t liberal and enlightened friends of freedom, and they were pro|portionably inflamed and di&s;gu&s;ted by the fury of his a&s;&s;ault, upon what they deemed to be its &s;acred cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Short as was the time in which Mary compo&s;ed her An&s;wer to Burke's Reflections, there was one anecdote &s;he told me concerning it, which &s;eems worth recording in this place. It was &s;ent to the pre&s;s, as is
<PB N="77" REF="82">
the general practice when the early publication of a piece is deemed a matter of importance, before the com|po&s;ition was fini&s;hed. When Mary had arrived at about the middle of her work, &s;he was &s;eized with a tempo|rary fit of torpor and indolence, and began to repent of her undertaking. In this &s;tate of mind, &s;he called, one evening, as &s;he was in the practice of doing, upon her publi&s;her, for the pur|po&s;e of relieving her&s;elf by an hour or two's conver&s;ation. Here, the ha|bitual ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of her nature, led her to de&s;cribe what had ju&s;t pa&s;t in her thoughts. Mr. John&s;on imme|diately, in a kind and friendly way, intreated her not to put any con&s;traint upon her inclination, and to give her|&s;elf no unea&s;ine&s;s about the &s;heets al|ready printed, which he would cheer|fully
<PB N="78" REF="83">
throw a&s;ide, if it would contri|bute to her happine&s;s. Mary had wanted &s;timulus. She had not ex|pected to be encouraged, in what &s;he well knew to be an unrea&s;onable ac|ce&s;s of idlene&s;s. Her friend's &s;o rea|dily falling in with her ill-humour, and &s;eeming to expect that &s;he would lay a&s;ide her undertaking, piqued her pride. She immediately went home; and proceeded to the end of her work, with no other interruptions but what were ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is probable that the applau&s;e which attended her An&s;wer to Burke, elevated the tone of her mind. She had always felt much confidence in her own powers; but it cannot be doubt|ed, that the actual perception of a &s;imilar feeling re&s;pecting us in a mul|titude of others, mu&s;t increa&s;e the
<PB N="79" REF="84">
confidence, and &s;timulate the adven|ture of any human being. Mary ac|cordingly proceeded, in a &s;hort time after, to the compo&s;ition of her mo&s;t celebrated production, the Vindication of the Rights of Woman.</P>
<P>Never did any author enter into a cau&s;e, with a more ardent de&s;ire to be found, not a flouri&s;hing and empty declaimer, but an effectual champion. She con&s;idered her&s;elf as &s;tanding forth in defence of one half of the human &s;pecies, labouring under a yoke which, through all the records of time, had degraded them from the &s;tation of rational beings, and almo&s;t &s;unk them to the level of the brutes. She &s;aw indeed, that they were often attempt|ed to be held in &s;ilken fetters, and bribed into the love of &s;lavery; but the di&s;gui&s;e and the treachery &s;erved
<PB N="78" REF="85">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="79" REF="86">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="80" REF="87">
only the more fully to confirm her op|po&s;ition. She regarded her &s;ex, in the language of Cali&s;ta, as <Q>"In every &s;tate of life the &s;laves of men:"</Q> the rich as alternately under the de&s;po|ti&s;m of a father, a brother, and a hu&s;band; and the middling and the poorer cla&s;&s;es &s;hut out from the acqui|&s;ition of bread with independence, when they are not &s;hut out from the very means of an indu&s;trious &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. Such were the views &s;he en|tertained of the &s;ubject; and &s;uch the feelings with which &s;he warmed her mind.</P>
<P>The work is certainly a very bold and original production. The &s;trength and firmne&s;s with which the author repels the opinions of Rou&s;&s;eau, Dr. Gregory, and Dr. James Fordyce, re|&s;pecting
<PB N="81" REF="88">
the condition of women, cannot but make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon every ingenuous reader. The public at large formed very different opinions re&s;pecting the character of the performance. Many of the &s;en|timents are undoubtedly of a rather ma&s;culine de&s;cription. The &s;pirited and deci&s;ive way in which the author explodes the &s;y&s;tem of gallantry, and the &s;pecies of homage with which the &s;ex is u&s;ually treated, &s;hocked the ma|jority. Novelty produced a &s;entiment in their mind, which they mi&s;took for a &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice. The pretty, &s;oft creatures that are &s;o often to be found in the female &s;ex, and that cla&s;s of men who believe they could not exi&s;t without &s;uch pretty, &s;oft creatures to re&s;ort to, were in arms again&s;t the au|thor of &s;o heretical and bla&s;phemous
<PB N="82" REF="89">
a doctrine. There are al&s;o, it mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;&s;ed, occa&s;ional pa&s;&s;ages of a &s;tern and rugged feature, incompati|ble with the true &s;tamina of the wri|ter's character. But, if they did not belong to her fixed and permanent character, they belonged to her cha|racter <HI>pro tempore</HI>; and what &s;he thought, &s;he &s;corned to qualify.</P>
<P>Yet, along with this rigid, and &s;ome|what amazonian temper, which cha|racteri&s;ed &s;ome parts of the book, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to remark a luxu|riance of imagination, and a trembling delicacy of &s;entiment, which would have done honour to a poet, bur&s;ting with all the vi&s;ions of an Armida and a Dido.</P>
<P>The contradiction, to the public ap|prehen&s;ion, was equally great, as to the per&s;on of the author, as it was when they con&s;idered the temper of
<PB N="83" REF="90">
the book. In the champion of her &s;ex, who was de&s;cribed as endeavour|ing to inve&s;t them with all the rights of man, tho&s;e whom curio&s;ity prompt|ed to &s;eek the occa&s;ion of beholding her, expected to find a &s;turdy, mu&s;cu|lar, raw-boned virago; and they were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, when, in&s;tead of all this, they found a woman, lovely in her per&s;on, and, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t engaging &s;en&s;e, feminine in her man|ners.</P>
<P>The Vindication of the Rights of Woman is undoubtedly a very unequal performance, and eminently deficient in method and arrangement. When tried by the hoary and long-e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of literary compo&s;ition, it can &s;carcely maintain its claim to be placed in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of human pro|ductions. But when we con&s;ider the
<PB N="84" REF="91">
importance of its doctrines, and the eminence of genius it di&s;plays, it &s;eems not very improbable that it will be read as long as the Engli&s;h language endures. The publication of this book forms an epocha in the &s;ubject to which it belongs; and Mary Woll|&s;tonecraft will perhaps hereafter be found to have performed more &s;ub&s;tan|tial &s;ervice for the cau&s;e of her &s;ex, than all the other writers, male or fe|male, that ever felt them&s;elves animat|ed in the behalf of oppre&s;&s;ed and in|jured beauty.</P>
<P>The cen&s;ure of the liberal critic as to the defects of this performance, will be changed into a&s;toni&s;hment, when I tell him, that a work of this in|e&s;timable moment, was begun, carried on, and fini&s;hed in the &s;tate in which
<PB N="85" REF="92">
it now appears, in a period of no more than &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary here that I &s;hould re|&s;ume the &s;ubject of the friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Mary and Mr. Fu|&s;eli, which proved the &s;ource of the mo&s;t memorable events in her &s;ub&s;e|quent hi&s;tory. He is a native of the republic of Switzerland, but has &s;pent the principal part of his life in the i&s;land of Great-Britain. The emi|nence of his genius can &s;carcely be di&s;puted; it has indeed received the te&s;timony which is the lea&s;t to be &s;u&s;|pected, that of &s;ome of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of his contemporary arti&s;ts. He has one of the mo&s;t &s;triking cha|racteri&s;tics of genius, a daring, as well as per&s;evering, &s;pirit of adventure. The work in which he is at pre&s;ent engaged, a &s;eries of pictures for the
<PB N="86" REF="93">
illu&s;tration of Milton, upon a very large &s;cale, and produced &s;olely upon the incitement of his own mind, is a proof of this, if indeed his whole life had not &s;ufficiently proved it.</P>
<P>Mr. Fu&s;eli is one of Mr. John&s;on's olde&s;t friends, and was at this time in the habit of vi&s;iting him two or three times a week. Mary, one of who&s;e &s;tronge&s;t characteri&s;tics was the exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure &s;he felt from the a&s;&s;ociations of vi&s;ible objects, had hitherto never been acquainted, or ne|ver intimately acquainted, with an eminent painter. The being thus in|troduced therefore to the &s;ociety of Mr. Fu&s;eli, was a high gratification to her; while he found in Mary, a per&s;on perhaps more &s;u&s;ceptible of the emo|tions painting is calculated to excite, than any other with whom he ever
<PB N="87" REF="94">
conver&s;ed. Painting, and &s;ubjects clo&s;ely connected with painting, were their al|mo&s;t con&s;tant topics of conver&s;ation; and they found them inexhau&s;tible. It can|not be doubted, but that this was a &s;pe|cies of exerci&s;e very conducive to the improvement of Mary's mind.</P>
<P>Nothing human however is unmix|ed. If Mary derived improvement from Mr. Fu&s;eli, &s;he may al&s;o be &s;u&s;|pected of having caught the infection of &s;ome of his faults. In early life Mr. Fu&s;eli was ardently attached to literature; but the demands of his profe&s;&s;ion have prevented him from keeping up that exten&s;ive and indi&s;|criminate acquaintance with it, that belles-lettres &s;cholars frequently po&s;|&s;e&s;s.

ab&s;tract and depo&s;it of every human perfection. Milton, Shake&s;pear, and Richard&s;on, have al&s;o engaged much of his attention. The neare&s;t rival of Ho|mer, I believe, if Homer can have a ri|val, is Jean Jacques Rou&s;&s;eau. A young man embraces entire the opinions of a favourite writer, and Mr. Fu&s;eli has not had lei&s;ure to bring the opinions of his youth to a revi&s;ion. Smitten with Rou&s;&s;eau's conception of the perfectne&s;s of the &s;avage &s;tate, and the e&s;&s;ential abortivene&s;s of all civili|zation, Mr. Fu&s;eli looks at all our lit|tle attempts at improvement, with a &s;pirit that borders perhaps too much upon contempt and indifference. One of his favourite po&s;itions is the divi|nity of genius. This is a power that comes complete at once from the hands of the Creator of all things, and the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of a man of real
<PB N="89" REF="96">
genius are &s;uch, in all their grand and mo&s;t important features, as no &s;ub&s;e|quent a&s;&s;iduity can amend. Add to this, that Mr. Fu&s;eli is &s;omewhat of a cau&s;tic turn of mind, with much wit, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;earch, in every thing new or modern, for occa&s;ions of cen&s;ure. I believe Mary came &s;ome|thing more a cynic out of the &s;chool of Mr. Fu&s;eli, than &s;he went into it.</P>
<P>But the principal circum&s;tance that relates to the intercour&s;e of Mary, and this celebrated arti&s;t, remains to be told. She &s;aw Mr. Fu&s;eli frequent|ly; he amu&s;ed, delighted and in&s;truct|ed her. As a painter, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble &s;he &s;hould not wi&s;h to &s;ee his works, and con&s;equently to frequent his hou&s;e. She vi&s;ited him; her vi&s;its were returned. Notwith&s;tanding the inequality of their years, Mary was not
<PB N="90" REF="97">
of a temper to live upon terms of &s;o much intimacy with a man of merit and genius, without loving him. The delight &s;he enjoyed in his &s;ociety, &s;he transferred by a&s;&s;ociation to his per&s;on. What &s;he experienced in this re&s;pect, was no doubt heightened, by the &s;tate of celibacy and re&s;traint in which &s;he had hitherto lived, and to which the rules of poli&s;hed &s;ociety condemn an unmarried woman. She conceived a per&s;onal and ardent af|fection for him. Mr. Fu&s;eli was a married man, and his wife the ac|quaintance of Mary. She readily perceived the re&s;trictions which this circum&s;tance &s;eemed to impo&s;e upon her; but &s;he made light of any diffi|culty that might ari&s;e out of them. Not that &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible to the va|lue of dome&s;tic endearments between
<PB N="91" REF="98">
per&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite &s;ex, but that the &s;corned to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he could feel a &s;truggle, in conforming to the laws &s;he &s;hould lay down to her con|duct.</P>
<P>There cannot perhaps be a proper|er place than the pre&s;ent, to &s;tate her principles upon this &s;ubject, &s;uch at lea&s;t as they were when I knew her be&s;t. She &s;et a great value on a mu|tual affection between per&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite &s;ex. She regarded it as the principal &s;olace of human life. It was her maxim, "that the imagination &s;hould awaken the &s;en&s;es, and not the &s;en&s;es the imagination." In other words, that whatever related to the gratification of the &s;en&s;es, ought to ari&s;e, in a human being of a pure mind, only as the con&s;equence of an indivi|dual affection. She regarded the man|ners
<PB N="92" REF="99">
and habits of the majority of our &s;ex in that re&s;pect, with &s;trong di&s;ap|probation. She conceived that true virtue would pre&s;cribe the mo&s;t entire celibacy, exclu&s;ively of affection, and the mo&s;t perfect fidelity to that affec|tion when it exi&s;ted.&mdash;There is no rea|&s;on to doubt that, if Mr. Fu&s;eli had been di&s;engaged at the period of their acquaintance, he would have been the man of her choice. As it was, &s;he conceived it both practicable and eli|gible, to cultivate a di&s;tingui&s;hing af|fection for him, and to fo&s;ter it by the endearments of per&s;onal intercour&s;e and a reciprocation of kindne&s;s, with|out departing in the &s;malle&s;t degree from the rules &s;he pre&s;cribed to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In September 1791, &s;he removed from the hou&s;e &s;he occupied in George-&s;treet, to a large and commodious
<PB N="93" REF="100">
apartment in Store &s;treet, Bedford|&s;quare. She began to think that &s;he had been too rigid, in the laws of fru|gality and &s;elf-denial with which &s;he &s;et out in her literary career; and now added to the neatne&s;s and cleanline&s;s which &s;he had always &s;crupulou&s;ly ob|&s;erved, a certain degree of elegance, and tho&s;e temperate indulgences in furniture and accommodation, from which a &s;ound and uncorrupted ta&s;te never fails to derive plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was in the month of November in the &s;ame year (1791), that the writer of this narrative was fir&s;t in company with the per&s;on to whom it relates. He dined with her at a friend's, together with Mr. Tho|mas Paine and one or two other per&s;ons. The invitation was of his own &s;eeking, his object being to &s;ee
<PB N="94" REF="101">
the author of the Rights of Man, with whom he had never before conver&s;ed</P>
<P>The interview was not fortunate Mary and my&s;elf parted, mutually di&s;plea&s;ed with each other. I had no read her Rights of Woman. I had barely looked into her An&s;wer to Burke and been di&s;plea&s;ed, as literary men are apt to be, with a few offences again&s;t grammar and other minute points of compo&s;ition. I had there|fore little curio&s;ity to &s;ee Mrs. Woll|&s;tonecraft, and a very great curio&s;ity to &s;ee Thomas Paine. Paine, in his ge|neral habits, is no great talker; and, though he threw in occa&s;ionally &s;ome &s;hrewd and &s;triking remarks; the conver&s;ation lay principally between me and Mary. I, of con&s;equence, heard her, very frequently when I wi&s;h|ed to hear Paine.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102">
We touched on a con&s;iderable va|riety of topics, and particularly on the characters and habits of certain eminent men. Mary, as has already been ob&s;erved, had acquired, in a very blameable degree, the practice of &s;ee|ing every thing on the gloomy &s;ide, and be&s;towing cen&s;ure with a plentiful hand, where circum&s;tances were in any re&s;pect doubtful. I, on the con|trary, had a &s;trong propen&s;ity, to fa|vourable con&s;truction, and particularly, where I found unequivocal marks of genius, &s;trongly to incline to the &s;up|po&s;ition of generous and manly virtue. We ventilated in this way the charac|ters of Voltaire and others, who have obtained from &s;ome individuals an ar|dent admiration, while the greater number have treated them with ex|treme moral &s;everity. Mary was at
<PB N="96" REF="103">
la&s;t provoked to tell me, that prai&s;e lavi&s;hed in the way that I lavi&s;hed it could do no credit either to the com|mended or the commender. We di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed &s;ome que&s;tions on the &s;ubject of religion, in which her opinions ap|proached much nearer to the received ones, than mine. As the conver&s;ation proceeded, I became di&s;&s;atisfied with the tone of my own &s;hare in it. We touched upon all topics, without treat|ing forcibly and connectedly upon any. Meanwhile, I did her the ju&s;|tice, in giving an account of the con|ver&s;ation to a party in which I &s;upped, though I was not &s;paring of my blame, to yield her the prai&s;e of a per&s;on of active and independent thinking. On her &s;ide, &s;he did me no part of what perhaps I con&s;idered as ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>We met two or three times in the
<PB N="97" REF="104">
cour&s;e of the following year, but made a very &s;mall degree of progre&s;s towards a cordial acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of the year 1792, Mary went over to France, where &s;he con|tinued to re&s;ide for upwards of two years. One of her principal induce|ments to this &s;tep, related, I believe, to Mr. Fu&s;eli. She had, at fir&s;t, con&s;ider|ed it as rea&s;onable and judicious, to cultivate what I may be permitted to call, a Platonic affection for him; but &s;he did not, in the &s;equel, find all the &s;atisfaction in this plan, which &s;he had originally expected from it. It was in vain that &s;he enjoyed much plea&s;ure in his &s;ociety, and that &s;he enjoyed it frequently. Her ardent imagination was continually conjuring up pictures of the happine&s;s &s;he &s;hould have found, if fortune had favoured their more in|timate
<PB N="98" REF="105">
union. She felt her&s;elf former for dome&s;tic affection, and all tho&s;e tender charities, which men of &s;en&s;ibi|lity have con&s;tantly treated as the dear|e&s;t band of human &s;ociety. Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> conver&s;ation and &s;ociety could not &s;a|tisfy her. She felt her&s;elf alone, as were, in the great ma&s;s of her &s;pecies and &s;he repined when &s;he reflected that the be&s;t years of her life were &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in this comfortle&s;s &s;olitude.

than twelve months, &s;he produced no|thing, except a few articles in the Ana|lytical Review. Her literary medita|tions were chiefly employed upon the Sequel to the Rights of Woman; but &s;he has &s;carcely left behind her a &s;ingle paper, that can, with any certainty, be a&s;&s;igned to have had this de&s;tination.</P>

<P>THE original plan of Mary, re|&s;pecting her re&s;idence in France, had no preci&s;e limits in the article of du|ration; the &s;ingle purpo&s;e &s;he had in view being that of an endeavour to heal her di&s;tempered mind. She did not proceed &s;o far as even to di&s;charge her lodging in London; and, to &s;ome friends who &s;aw her immediately before her departure, &s;he &s;poke merely of an ab|&s;ence of &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="108">
It is not to be wondered at, that her excur&s;ion did not originally &s;eem to produce the effects &s;he had expected from it. She was in a land of &s;trangers; &s;he had no acquaintance; &s;he had even to acquire the power of receiving and communicating ideas with facility in the language of the country. Her fir&s;t re&s;idence was in a &s;pacious man&s;ion to which &s;he had been invited, but the ma&s;ter of which (mon&s;ieur Fillietaz) was ab&s;ent at the time of her arrival. At fir&s;t therefore &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded only with &s;ervants. The gloomine&s;s of her mind communicated its own colour to the objects &s;he &s;aw; and in this temper &s;he began a &s;eries of Letters on the Pre&s;ent Character of the French Nation, one of which &s;he for|warded to her publi&s;her, and which ap|pears in the collection of her po&s;thumous
<PB N="102" REF="109">
works. This performance &s;he &s;oon after di&s;continued; and it is, as &s;he ju&s;tly remarks, tinged with the &s;atur|nine temper which at that time per|vaded her mind.</P>
<P>Mary carried with her introductions to &s;everal agreeable families in Paris. She renewed her acquaintance with Paine. There al&s;o &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a very &s;in|cere friend&s;hip between her and Helen Maria Williams, author of a collection of poems of uncommon merit, who at that time re&s;ided in Paris. Another per&s;on, whom Mary always &s;poke of in terms-of ardent commendation, both for the excellence of his di&s;po&s;ition, and the force of his genius, was a count Slabrendorf, by birth, I believe, a Swede. It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, that &s;he was per&s;onally ac|quainted
<PB N="103" REF="110">
with the majority of the leaders in the French revolution.</P>
<P>But the hou&s;e that, I believe, &s;he principally frequented at this time, was that of Mr. Thomas Chri&s;tie, a per&s;on who&s;e pur&s;uits were mercantile, and who had written a volume on the French revolution. With Mrs. Chri&s;tie her acquaintance was more intimate than with the hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It was about four months after her arrival at Paris in December 1792, that &s;he entered into that &s;pecies of connection, for which her heart &s;ecretly panted, and which had the effect of diffu&s;ing an immediate tranquillity and cheerfulne&s;s over her manners. The per&s;on with whom it was formed (for it would be an idle piece of delicacy, to attempt to &s;uppre&s;s a name, which is known to every one whom the reputa|tion
<PB N="104" REF="111">
of Mary has reached, was Mr. Gil|bert Imlay, native of the United States of North America</P>
<P>The place at which &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw Mr. Imlay was at the hou&s;e of Mr. Chri&s;|tie; and it perhaps de&s;erves to be no|ticed, that the emotions he then excit|ed in her mind, were, I am told, tho&s;e of di&s;like, and that, for &s;ome time, &s;he &s;hunned all occa&s;ions of meeting him. This &s;entiment however &s;peedily gave place to one of greater kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to the partiality &s;he con|ceived for him, &s;he had determined upon a journey to Switzerland, induc|ed chiefly by motives of economy. But &s;he had &s;ome difficulty in procur|ing a pa&s;&s;port; and it was probably the intercour&s;e that now originated be|tween her and Mr. Imlay, that chang|ed her purpo&s;e, and led her to prefer
<PB N="105" REF="112">
a lodging at Neuilly, a village three miles from Paris. Her habitation here was a &s;olitary hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of a garden, with no other inhabitants than her&s;elf and the gardener, an old man, who performed for her many of the offices of a dome&s;tic, and would &s;ometimes contend for the honour of making her bed. The gardener had a great veneration for his gue&s;t, and would &s;et before her, when alone, &s;ome grapes of a particularly fine &s;ort, which &s;he could not without the great|e&s;t difficulty obtain, when &s;he had any per&s;on with her as a vi&s;itor. Here it was that &s;he conceived, and for the mo&s;t part executed, her Hi&s;torical and Moral View of the French Revolution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No part of the propo&s;ed continuation of this work, has been found among the papers of the author.</NOTE>, into which, as &s;he ob&s;erves, are incor|porated mo&s;t of the ob&s;ervations &s;he
<PB N="106" REF="113">
had collected for her Letters, and which was written with more &s;obriety and cheerfulne&s;s than the tone in which they had been commenced. In the evening &s;he was accu&s;tomed to refre&s;h her&s;elf by a walk in a neighbouring wood, from which her old ho&s;t in vain endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her, by re|counting divers horrible robberies and murders that had been committed there.</P>
<P>The commencement of the attach|ment Mary now formed, had neither confident nor advi&s;er. She always con|ceived it to be a gro&s;s breach of deli|cacy to have any confidant in a matter of this &s;acred nature, an affair of the heart. The origin of the connection was about the middle of April 1793, and it was carried on in a private man|ner for four months. At the expira|tion of that period a circum&s;tance oc|curred
<PB N="107" REF="114">
that induced her to declare it. The French convention, exa&s;perated at the conduct of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, particularly in the affair of Tou|lon, formed a decree again&s;t the citi|zens of this country, by one article of which the Engli&s;h, re&s;ident in France, were ordered into pri&s;on till the period of a general peace. Mary had object|ed to a marriage with Mr. Imlay, who, at the time their connection was form|ed, had no property whatever; becau&s;e &s;he would not involve him in certain family embarra&s;&s;ments to which &s;he conceived her&s;elf expo&s;ed, or make him an&s;werable for the pecuniary de|mands that exi&s;ted again&s;t her. She however con&s;idered their engagement as of the mo&s;t &s;acred nature; and they had mutually formed the plan of emi|grating to America, as &s;oon as they
<PB N="108" REF="115">
&s;hould have realized a &s;um, enabling them to do it in the mode they de&s;ired. The decree however that I have ju&s;t mentioned, made it nece&s;&s;ary, not that a marriage &s;hould actually take place, but that Mary &s;hould take the name of Imlay, which, from the nature of their connection, &s;he conceived her&s;elf en|titled to do and obtain a certificate from the American amba&s;&s;ador, as the wife of a native of that country.</P>
<P>Their engagement being thus avow|ed, they thought proper to re&s;ide un|der the &s;ame roof, and for that purpo&s;e removed to Paris.</P>
<P>Mary was now arrived at the &s;itua|tion, which, for two or three preceding years, her rea&s;on had pointed out to her as affording the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial pro&s;pect of happine&s;s. She had been to&s;&s;ed and agitated by the waves of
<PB N="109" REF="116">
misfortune. Her childhood, as &s;he of|ten &s;aid, had known few of the en|dearments, which con&s;titute the princi|pal happine&s;s of childhood. The tem|per of her father had early given to her mind a &s;evere ca&s;t of thought, and &s;ub&s;tituted the inflexibility of re&s;i&s;tance for the confidence of affection. The cheerfulne&s;s of her entrance upon wo|manhood, had been darkened, by an attendance upon the death-bed of her mother, and the &s;till more afflicting calamity of her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. Her exer|tions to create a joint independence for her &s;i&s;ters and her&s;elf, had been at|tended, neither with the &s;ucce&s;s, nor the plea&s;ure, &s;he had hoped from them. Her fir&s;t youthful pa&s;&s;ion, her friend&s;hip for Fanny, had encountered many di&s;|appointments, and, in fine, a melan|choly and premature cata&s;trophe. Soon
<PB N="110" REF="117">
after the&s;e accumulated mortifications, &s;he was engaged in a conte&s;t with a near relation, whom &s;he regarded as unprincipled, re&s;pecting the wreck of her father's fortune. In this affair &s;he &s;uffered the double pain, which ari&s;es from moral indignation, and di&s;appoint|ed benevolence. Her exertions to a&s;&s;i&s;t almo&s;t every member of her family, were great and unremitted. Finally, when &s;he indulged a romantic affection for Mr. Fu&s;eli, and fondly imagined that &s;he &s;hould find in it the &s;olace of her cares, &s;he perceived too late, that, by continually impre&s;&s;ing on her mind fruitle&s;s images of unre&s;erved affection and dome&s;tic felicity, it only &s;erved to give new pungency to the &s;en&s;ibility that was de&s;troying her.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons may be inclined to ob|&s;erve, that the evils here enumerated,
<PB N="111" REF="118">
are not among the heavie&s;t in the cata|logue of human calamities. But evils take their rank, more from the temper of the mind that &s;uffers them, than from their ab&s;tract nature. Upon a man of a hard and in&s;en&s;ible di&s;po&s;i|tion, the &s;hafts of misfortune often fall pointle&s;s and impotent. There are per|&s;ons, by no means hard and in&s;en&s;ible, who, from an ela&s;tic and &s;anguine turn of mind, are continually prompt|ed to look on the fair &s;ide of things, and, having &s;uffered one fall, immedi|ately ri&s;e again, to pur&s;ue their cour&s;e, with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s, the &s;ame hope, and the &s;ame gaiety, as before. On the other hand, we not unfrequent|ly meet with per&s;ons, endowed with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and delicious &s;en&s;i|bility, who&s;e minds &s;eem almo&s;t of too fine a texture to encounter the vici&s;&s;i|tudes
<PB N="112" REF="119">
of human affairs, to whom plea&s;ure is tran&s;port, and di&s;appointment is agony inde&s;cribable. This character is finely pourtrayed by the author of the Sorrows of Werter. Mary was in this re&s;pect a female Werter.</P>
<P>She brought then, in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, a wounded and &s;ick heart, to take refuge in the bo&s;om of a cho&s;en friend. Let it not however be ima|gined, that &s;he brought a heart, que|rulous, and ruined in its ta&s;te for plea|&s;ure. No; her whole character &s;eem|ed to change with a change of fortune. Her &s;orrows, the depre&s;&s;ion of her &s;pirits, were forgotten, and &s;he a&s;&s;umed all the &s;implicity and the vivacity of a youthful mind. She was like a &s;erpent upon a rock, that ca&s;ts its &s;lough, and appears again with the brilliancy, the &s;leekne&s;s, and the ela&s;tic activity of its
<PB N="113" REF="120">
happie&s;t age. She was playful, full of confidence, kindne&s;s and &s;ympathy. Her eyes a&s;&s;umed new lu&s;tre, and her cheeks new colour and &s;moothne&s;s. Her voice became chearful; her temper overflow|ing with univer&s;al kindne&s;s; and that &s;mile of bewitching tenderne&s;s from day to day illuminated her counte|nance, which all who knew her will &s;o well recollect, and which won, both heart and &s;oul, the affection of almo&s;t every one that beheld it.</P>
<P>Mary now repo&s;ed her&s;elf upon a per&s;on, of who&s;e honour and princi|ples &s;he had the mo&s;t exalted idea. She nouri&s;hed an individual affection, which &s;he &s;aw no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubject|ing to re&s;traint; and a heart like her's was not formed to nouri&s;h affection by halves. Her conception of Mr. Im|lay's "tenderne&s;s and worth, had
<PB N="114" REF="121">
twi&s;ted him clo&s;ely round her heart;" and &s;he "indulged the thought, that &s;he had thrown out &s;ome tendrils, to cling to the elm by which &s;he wi&s;hed to be &s;upported." This was "talking a new language to her; but, con|&s;cious that &s;he was not a para&s;ite-plant," &s;he was willing to encourage and fo&s;ter the luxuriancies of affection. Her confidence was entire; her love was unbounded. Now, for the fir&s;t time in her life, &s;he gave a loo&s;e to all the &s;en&s;ibilities of her nature.</P>
<P>Soon after the time I am now &s;peak|ing of, her attachment to Mr. Imlay gained a new link, by finding rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf with child.</P>
<P>Their e&s;tabli&s;hment at Paris, was however broken up almo&s;t as &s;oon as formed, by the circum&s;tance of Mr. Imlay's entering into bu&s;ine&s;s, urged,
<PB N="115" REF="122">
as he &s;aid, by the pro&s;pect of a family, and this being a favourable cri&s;is in French affairs for commercial &s;pecula|tions. The pur&s;uits in which he was engaged, led him in the month of Sep|tember to Havre de Grace, then called Havre Marat, probably to &s;uperintend the &s;hipping of goods, in which he was jointly engaged with &s;ome other per|&s;on or per&s;ons. Mary remained in the capital.</P>
<P>The &s;olitude in which &s;he was now left, proved an unexpected trial. Dome&s;tic affections con&s;tituted the ob|ject upon which her heart was fixed; and &s;he early felt, with an inward grief, that Mr. Imlay "did not attach tho&s;e tender emotions round the idea of home," which, every time they re|curred, dimmed her eyes with moi&s;|ture. She had expected his return
<PB N="116" REF="123">
from week to week, and from month to month; but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;till continued to detain him at Havre. At the &s;ame time the &s;anguinary cha|racter which the government of France began every day more deci&s;ively to a&s;|&s;ume, contributed to bani&s;h tranquil|lity from the fir&s;t months of her preg|nancy. Before &s;he left Neuilly, &s;he happened one day to enter Paris on foot (I believe, by the <HI>Place de Louis Quinze</HI>), when an execution, attended with &s;ome peculiar aggravations, had ju&s;t taken place, and the blood of the guillotine appeared fre&s;h upon the pavement. The emotions of her foul bur&s;t forth in indignant exclamations, while a prudent by&s;tander warned her of her danger, and intreated her to ha&s;ten and hide her di&s;contents. She de&s;cribed to me, more than once, the
<PB N="117" REF="124">
angui&s;h &s;he felt at hearing of the death of Bri&s;&s;ot, Vergniaud, and the twenty deputies, as one of the mo&s;t intolera|ble &s;en&s;ations &s;he had ever experi|enced.</P>
<P>Finding the return of Mr. Imlay continually po&s;tponed, &s;he determined, in January 1794, to join him at Havre. One motive that influenced her, though, I believe, by no means the principal, was the growing cruelties of Robe&s;pierre, and the de&s;ire &s;he felt to be in any other place, rather than the devoted city, in the mid&s;t of which they were perpetrated.</P>
<P>From January to September, Mr. Imlay and Mary lived together, with great harmony, at Havre, where the child, with which &s;he was pregnant, was born, on the fourteenth of May, and named Frances, in remembrance of
<PB N="118" REF="125">
the dear friend of her youth, who&s;e image could never be era&s;ed from her memory.</P>
<P>In September, Mr. Imlay took his departure from Havre for the port of London. As this &s;tep was &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, he endeavoured to prevail upon Mary to quit Havre, and once more take up her abode at Paris. Robe&s;pierre was now no more, and, of con&s;equence, the only objection &s;he had to re&s;iding in the ca|pital, was removed. Mr. Imlay was already in London, before &s;he under|took her journey, and it proved the mo&s;t fatiguing journey &s;he ever made; the carriage, in which &s;he travelled, being overturned no le&s;s than four times between Havre and Paris.</P>
<P>This ab&s;ence, like that of the pre|ceding year in which Mr. Imlay had
<PB N="119" REF="126">
removed to Havre, was repre&s;ented as an ab&s;ence that was to have a &s;hort duration. In two months he was once again to join her at Paris. It proved however the prelude to an eternal &s;e|paration. The agonies of &s;uch a &s;epa|ration, or rather de&s;ertion, great as Mary would have found them upon every &s;uppo&s;ition, were va&s;tly increa&s;ed, by the lingering method in which it was effected, and the ambiguity that, for a long time, hung upon it. This circum&s;tance produced the effect, of holding her mind, by force, as it were, to the mo&s;t painful of all &s;ubjects, and not &s;uffering her to derive the ju&s;t ad|vantage from the energy and ela&s;ticity of her character.</P>
<P>The procra&s;tination of which I am &s;peaking was however productive of one advantage. It put off the evil
<PB N="120" REF="127">
day. She did not &s;u&s;pect the calami|ties that awaited her, till the clo&s;e of the year. She gained an additional three months of comparative happine&s;s. But &s;he purcha&s;ed it at a very dear rate. Perhaps no human creature ever &s;uffer|ed greater mi&s;ery, than dyed the whole year 1795, in the life of this incom|parable woman. It was wa&s;ted in that &s;ort of de&s;pair, to the &s;en&s;e of which the mind is continually awaken|ed, by a glimmering of fondly cheri&s;h|ed, expiring hope.</P>
<P>Why did &s;he thus ob&s;tinately cling to an ill-&s;tarred, unhappy pa&s;&s;ion? Be|cau&s;e it is of the very e&s;&s;ence of affec|tion, to &s;eek to perpetuate it&s;elf. He does not love, who can re&s;ign this che|ri&s;hed &s;entiment, without &s;uffering &s;ome of the &s;harpe&s;t &s;truggles that our nature is capable of enduring. Add

to this, Mary had fixed her heart upon this cho&s;en friend; and one of the la&s;t impre&s;&s;ions a worthy mind can &s;ubmit to receive, is that of the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the per&s;on upon whom it has fixed all its e&s;teem. Mary had &s;truggled to entertain a favourable opinion of hu|man nature; &s;he had unweariedly &s;ought for a kindred mind, in who&s;e integrity and fidelity to take up her re&s;t. Mr. Imlay undertook to prove, in his letters written immediately after their complete &s;eparation, that his conduct towards her was reconcilable to the &s;tricte&s;t rectitude; but undoubt|edly Mary was of a different opinion. Whatever the reader may decide in this re&s;pect, there is one &s;entiment that, I believe, he will unhe&s;itatingly admit: that of pity for the mi&s;take of the man, who, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="122" REF="129">
&s;uch a friend&s;hip and attachment as tho&s;e of Mary, could hold them at a trivial price, and, "like the ba&s;e In|dian, throw a pearl away, richer than all his tribe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A per&s;on, from who&s;e &s;ociety at this time Mary derived particular gratification, was Archibald Ham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lton Rowan, who had lately become a fugi|tive from Ireland, in con&s;equence of a political pro&s;ecution, and in whom &s;he found tho&s;e quali|ties which were always eminently engaging to her, great integrity of di&s;po&s;ition, and great kindne&s;s of heart.</NOTE>"</P>

<P>IN April 1795, Mary returned once more to London, being reque&s;ted to do &s;o by Mr. Imlay, who even &s;ent a &s;er|vant to Paris to wait upon her in the journey, before &s;he could complete the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements for her depar|ture. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e fa|vourable appearances, &s;he came to Eng|land with a heavy heart, not daring, after all the uncertainties and angui&s;h &s;he had endured, to tru&s;t to the &s;ugge&s;|tions of hope.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">
The gloomy forebodings of he mind, were but too faithfully verified Mr. Imlay had already formed another connection; as it is &s;aid, with a young actre&s;s from a &s;trolling company of players. His attentions therefore to Mary were formal and con&s;trained, and &s;he probably had but little of his &s;oci|ety. This alteration could not e&s;cape her penetrating glance. He a&s;cribed it to pre&s;&s;ure of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ome pe|cuniary embarra&s;&s;ments which, at that time, occurred to him; it was of little con&s;equence to Mary what was the cau&s;e. She &s;aw, but too well, though &s;he &s;trove not to &s;ee, that his affections were lo&s;t to her for ever.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine a period of greater pain and mortification than Mary pa&s;&s;ed, for about &s;even weeks, from the &s;ixteenth of April to the
<PB N="125" REF="132">
&s;ixth of June, in a furni&s;hed hou&s;e that Mr. Imlay had provided for her. She had come over to England, a country for which &s;he, at this time, ex|pre&s;&s;ed "a repugnance, that almo&s;t amounted to horror," in &s;earch of hap|pine&s;s. She feared that that happine&s;s had altogether e&s;caped her; but &s;he was encouraged by the eagerne&s;s and impatience which Mr. Imlay at length &s;eemed to manife&s;t for her arrival. When &s;he &s;aw him, all her fears were confirmed. What a picture was &s;he capable of forming to her&s;elf, of the overflowing kindne&s;s of a meeting, after an interval of &s;o much angui&s;h and apprehen&s;ion! A thou&s;and images of this &s;ort were pre&s;ent to her burning imagination. It is in vain, on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, for re&s;erve and reproach to en|deavour to curb in the emotions of an
<PB N="126" REF="133">
affectionate heart. But the hopes &s;he nouri&s;hed were &s;peedily bla&s;ted. He reception by Mr. Imlay, was cold and embarra&s;&s;ed. Di&s;cu&s;&s;ions ("explana|tions" they were called) followed; cruel explanations, that only added to the angui&s;h of a heart already over|whelmed in grief! They had &s;mall pre|ten&s;ions indeed to explicitne&s;s; but they &s;ufficiently told, that the ca&s;e ad|mitted not of remedy.</P>
<P>Mary was incapable of &s;u&s;taining her equanimity in this pre&s;&s;ing emer|gency. "Love, dear, delu&s;ive love! as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to a friend &s;ome time afterwards, rigorous rea|&s;on had forced her to re&s;ign; and now her rational pro&s;pects were bla&s;ted, ju&s;t as &s;he had learned to be contented with rational enjoyments." Thus &s;ituated, life became an intolerable burthen.
<PB N="127" REF="134">
While &s;he was ab&s;ent from Mr. Imlay, &s;he could talk of purpo&s;es of &s;eparation and independence. But, now that they were in the &s;ame hou&s;e, &s;he could not withhold her&s;elf from endeavours to revive their mutual cordiality; and un|&s;ucce&s;sful endeavours continually add|ed fuel to the fire that de&s;troyed her. She formed a de&s;perate purpo&s;e to die.</P>
<P>This part of the &s;tory of Mary is in|volved in con&s;iderable ob&s;curity. I only know, that Mr. Imlay became ac|quainted with her purpo&s;e, at a mo|ment when he was uncertain whether or no it were already executed, and that his feelings were rou&s;ed by the intelli|gence. It was perhaps owing to his activity and repre&s;entations, that her life was, at this time, &s;aved. She de|termined to continue to exi&s;t. Actu|ated by this purpo&s;e, &s;he took a re&s;olu|tion,
<PB N="128" REF="135">
worthy both of the &s;trength and affectionatene&s;s of her mind. Mr. Imlay was involved in a que&s;tion of con&s;ider|able difficulty, re&s;pecting a mercantile adventure in Norway. It &s;eemed to re|quire the pre&s;ence of &s;ome very judici|ous agent, to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s to its de&s;ired termination. Mary deter|mined to make the voyage, and take the bu&s;ine&s;s into her own hands. Such a voyage &s;eemed the mo&s;t de&s;ireable thing to recruit her health, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, her &s;pirits, in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is. It was al&s;o gratifying to her feelings, to be employed in promoting the inte|re&s;t of a man, from whom &s;he had ex|perienced &s;uch &s;evere unkindne&s;s, but to whom &s;he ardently de&s;ired to be re|conciled. The moment of de&s;peration I have mentioned, occurred in the clo&s;e of May, and, in about a week after,
<PB N="129" REF="136">
&s;he &s;et out upon this new expedition.</P>
<P>The narrative of this voyage is before the world, and perhaps a book of tra|vels that &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;eizes on the heart, never, in any other in&s;tance, found its way from the pre&s;s. The occa&s;ional har&s;hne&s;s and ruggedne&s;s of character, that diver&s;ify her Vindication of the Rights of Woman, here totally di&s;appear. If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She &s;peaks of her &s;orrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and di&s;&s;olves us in tenderne&s;s, at the &s;ame time that &s;he di&s;plays a genius which commands all our admiration. Afflic|tion had tempered her heart to a &s;oftne&s;s almo&s;t more than human; and the gentlene&s;s of her &s;pirit &s;eems pre|ci&s;ely
<PB N="130" REF="137">
to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.</P>
<P>Thus &s;oftened and improved, thus fraught with imagination and &s;en&s;ibi|lity, with all, and more than all, "that youthful poets fancy, when they love," &s;he returned to England, and, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, to the arms of her former lover. Her return was ha&s;tened by the ambiguity, to her apprehen&s;ion, of Mr. Imlay's conduct. He had pro|mi&s;ed to meet her upon her return from Norway, probably at Hamburgh; and they were then to pa&s;s &s;ome time in Switzerland. The &s;tyle however of his letters to her during her tour, was not &s;uch as to in&s;pire confidence; and &s;he wrote to him very urgently, to ex|plain him&s;elf, relative to the footing upon which they were hereafter to &s;tand to each other. In his an&s;wer,
<PB N="131" REF="138">
which reached her at Hamburgh, he treated her que&s;tions as "extraordi|nary and unnece&s;&s;ary," and de&s;ired her to be at the pains to decide for her&s;elf. Feeling her&s;elf unable to accept this as an explanation, &s;he in&s;tantly determined to &s;ail for London by the very fir&s;t op|portunity, that &s;he might thus bring to a termination the &s;u&s;pence that prey|ed upon her &s;oul.</P>
<P>It was not long after her arrival in London in the commencement of Oc|tober, that &s;he attained the certainty &s;he &s;ought. Mr. Imlay procured her a lodging. But the neglect &s;he experi|enced from him after &s;he entered it, fla&s;hed conviction upon her, in &s;pite of his a&s;&s;everations. She made further en|quiries, and at length was informed by a &s;ervant, of the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Under the immediate &s;hock which the
<PB N="132" REF="139">
painful certainty gave her, her fir&s;t im|pul&s;e was to repair to him at the ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e he had provided for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> new mi&s;tre&s;s. What was the particu|lar nature of their conference I aM unable to relate. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the wretchedne&s;s of the night which &s;ucceeded this fatal di&s;covery, impre&s;&s;|ed her with the feeling, that &s;he would &s;ooner &s;uffer a thou&s;and deaths, than pa&s;s another of equal mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The agony of her mind determined her; and that determination gave her a &s;ort of de&s;perate &s;erenity. She re|&s;olved to plunge her&s;elf in the Thames; and, not being &s;atisfied with any &s;pot nearer to London, &s;he took a boat, and rowed to Putney. Her fir&s;t thought had led her to Batter&s;ea-bridge, but &s;he found it too public. It was night when &s;he arrived at Putney, and by
<PB N="133" REF="140">
that time had begun to rain with great violence. The rain &s;ugge&s;ted to her the idea of walking up and down the bridge, till her clothes were tho|roughly drenched and heavy with the wet, which &s;he did for half an hour without meeting a human being. She then leaped from the top of the bridge, but &s;till &s;eemed to find a diffi|culty in &s;inking, which &s;he endeavour|ed to counteract by pre&s;&s;ing her clothes clo&s;ely round her. After &s;ome time &s;he became in&s;en&s;ible; but &s;he always &s;poke of the pain &s;he underwent as &s;uch, that, though &s;he could afterwards have determined upon almo&s;t any other &s;pecies of voluntary death, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for her to re&s;olve upon encountering the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations again. I am doubtful, whether this is to be a&s;cribed to the mere nature of &s;uffoca|tion,
<PB N="134" REF="141">
or was not rather owing to the preternatural action of a de&s;perate &s;pirit.</P>
<P>After having been for a con&s;iderable time in&s;en&s;ible, &s;he was recovered by the exertions of tho&s;e by whom the body was found. She had &s;ought, with cool and deliberate firmne&s;s, to put a period to her exi&s;tence, and yet &s;he lived to have every pro&s;pect of a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of enjoyment and happine&s;s. It is perhaps not an unfrequent ca&s;e with &s;uicides, that we find rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, if they had &s;urvived their gloomy purpo&s;e, that they would, at a &s;ub&s;equent period, have been con&s;ider|ably happy. It ari&s;es indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, out of the very nature of a &s;pirit of &s;elf-de&s;truction; which im|plies a degree of angui&s;h, that the con|&s;i&s;tution of the human mind will not
<PB N="135" REF="142">
&s;uffer to remain long undimini&s;hed. This is a &s;erious reflection, Probably no man would de&s;troy him&s;elf from an impatience of pre&s;ent pain, if he felt a moral certainty that there were years of enjoyment &s;till in re&s;erve for him. It is perhaps a futile attempt, to think of rea&s;oning with a man in that &s;tate of mind which precedes &s;uicide. Moral rea&s;oning is nothing but the awaken|ing of certain feelings; and the feel|ing by which he is actuated, is too &s;trong to leave us much chance of im|pre&s;&s;ing him with other feelings, that &s;hould have force enough to counter|balance it. But, if the pro&s;pect of fu|ture tranquillity and plea&s;ure cannot be expected to have much weight with a man under an immediate purpo&s;e of &s;uicide, it is &s;o much the more to be wi&s;hed, that men would impre&s;s their
<PB N="136" REF="143">
minds, in their &s;ober moments, with a conception, which, being rendered ha|bitual, &s;eems to promi&s;e to act as a &s;uc|ce&s;sful antidote in a paroxy&s;m of de&s;|peration.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Mary, of nece&s;&s;ity produced &s;ome further inter|cour&s;e between her and Mr. Imlay. He &s;ent a phy&s;ician to her; and Mrs. Chri&s;tie, at his de&s;ire, prevailed on her to remove to her hou&s;e in Fin&s;bury|&s;quare. In the mean time Mr. Imlay a&s;&s;ured her that his pre&s;ent was merely a ca&s;ual, &s;en&s;ual connection; and, of cour&s;e, fo&s;tered in her mind the idea that it would be once more in her choice to live with him. With what|ever intention the idea was &s;ugge&s;ted, it was certainly calculated to increa&s;e the agitation of her mind. In one re&s;pect however it produced an effect
<PB N="137" REF="144">
unlike that which might mo&s;t obviou&s;ly have been looked for. It rou&s;ed within her the characteri&s;tic energy of mind, which &s;he &s;eemed partially to have for|gotten. She &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of bring|ing the affair to a point, and not &s;uffer|ing months and years to roll on in un|certainty and &s;u&s;pence. This idea in|&s;pired her with an extraordinary re&s;o|lution. The language &s;he employed, was, in effect, as follows: "If we are ever to live together again, it mu&s;t be now. We meet now, or we part for ever. You &s;ay, You cannot abruptly break off the connection you have formed. It is unworthy of my courage and character, to wait the uncertain i&s;&s;ue of that connection. I am de|termined to come to a deci&s;ion. I con&s;ent then, for the pre&s;ent, to live with you, and the woman to whom
<PB N="138" REF="145">
you have a&s;&s;ociated your&s;elf. I think it important that you &s;hould learn ha|bitually to feel for your child the affec|tion of a father. But, if you reject this propo&s;al, here we end. You are now free. We will corre&s;pond no more. We will have no intercour&s;e of any kind. I will be to you as a per&s;on that is dead."</P>
<P>The propo&s;al &s;he made, extraordinary and injudicious as it was, was at fir&s;t accepted; and Mr. Imlay took her accordingly, to look at a hou&s;e he was upon the point of hiring, that &s;he might judge whether it was calculated to plea&s;e her. Upon &s;econd thoughts however he retracted his conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the following month, Mr. Imlay, and the woman with whom he was at pre&s;ent connected, went to Paris, where they remained three months. Mary
<PB N="139" REF="146">
had, previou&s;ly to this, fixed her&s;elf in a lodging in Fin&s;bury-place, where, for &s;ome time, &s;he &s;aw &s;carcely any one but Mrs. Chri&s;tie, for the &s;ake of who&s;e neighbourhood &s;he had cho&s;en this &s;ituation; "exi&s;ting," as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it, "in a living tomb, and her life but an exerci&s;e of fortitude, continually on the &s;tretch."</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, it was unavoid|able for her thoughts to brood upon a pa&s;&s;ion, which all that &s;he had &s;uffered had not yet been able to extingui&s;h. Accordingly, as &s;oon as Mr. Imlay re|turned to England, &s;he could not re|&s;train her&s;elf from making another effort, and de&s;iring to &s;ee him once more. "During his ab&s;ence, affection had led her to make numberle&s;s excu&s;es for his conduct," and &s;he probably wi&s;h|ed to believe that his pre&s;ent connection
<PB N="140" REF="147">
was, as he repre&s;ented it, purely of a ca&s;ual nature. To this application, &s;he ob&s;erves, that "he returned no other an&s;wer, except declaring, with unju&s;ti|fiable pa&s;&s;ion, that he would not &s;ee her."</P>
<P>This an&s;wer, though, at the moment, highly irritating to Mary, was not the ultimate clo&s;e of the affair. Mr. Chri&s;tie was connected in bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Imlay, at the &s;ame time that the hou&s;e of Mr. Chri&s;tie was the only one at which Mary habitually vi&s;ited. The con&s;equence of this was, that, when Mr. Imlay had been already more than a fortnight in town, Mary called at Mr. Chri&s;tie's one evening, at a time when Mr. Imlay was in the parlour. The room was full of company. Mrs. Chri&s;tie heard Mary's voice in the pa&s;|&s;age, and ha&s;tened to her, to intreat her not to make her appearance. Mary
<PB N="141" REF="148">
however was not to be controlled. She thought, as &s;he afterwards told me, that it was not con&s;i&s;tent with con&s;ci|ous rectitude, that &s;he &s;hould &s;hrink, as if aba&s;hed, from the pre&s;ence of one by whom &s;he deemed her&s;elf injured. Her child was with her. She entered; and, in a firm manner, immediately led up the child, now near two years of age, to the knees of its father. He retired with Mary into another apart|ment, and promi&s;ed to dine with her at her lodging, I believe, the next day.</P>
<P>In the interview which took place in con&s;equence of this appointment, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her in friendly terms, and in a manner calculated to &s;ooth her de&s;pair. Though he could conduct him&s;elf, when ab&s;ent from her, in a way which &s;he cen&s;ured as unfeel|ing; this &s;pecies of &s;ternne&s;s con&s;tantly
<PB N="142" REF="149">
expired when he came into her pre|&s;ence. Mary was prepared at this mo|ment to catch at every phantom of happine&s;s; and the gentlene&s;s of his carriage, was to her as a &s;un-beam, awakening the hope of returning day. For an in&s;tant &s;he gave her&s;elf up to delu&s;ive vi&s;ions; and, even after the period of delirium expired, &s;he &s;till dwelt, with an aching eye, upon the air-built and un&s;ub&s;tantial pro&s;pect of a reconciliation.</P>
<P>At his particular reque&s;t, &s;he retained the name of Imlay, which, a &s;hort time before, he had &s;eemed to di&s;pute with her. "It was not," as &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in a letter to a friend, "for the world that &s;he did &s;o&mdash;not in the lea&s;t&mdash;but &s;he was unwilling to cut the Gordian knot, or tear her&s;elf away in appear|ance, when &s;he could not in reality."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150">
The day after this interview, &s;he &s;et out upon a vi&s;it to the country, where &s;he &s;pent nearly the whole of the month of March. It was, I believe, while &s;he was upon this vi&s;it, that &s;ome epi&s;|tolary communication with Mr. Imlay, induced her re&s;olutely to expel from her mind, all remaining doubt as to the i&s;&s;ue of the affair.</P>
<P>Mary was now aware that every demand of forbearance towards him, of duty to her child, and even of in|dulgence to her own deep-rooted pre|dilection, was di&s;charged. She deter|mined to rou&s;e her&s;elf, and ca&s;t off for ever an attachment, which to her had been a &s;pring of inexhau&s;tible bitter|ne&s;s. Her pre&s;ent re&s;idence among the &s;cenes of nature, was favourable to this purpo&s;e. She was at the hou&s;e of an old and intimate friend, a lady of
<PB N="144" REF="151">
the name of Cotton, who&s;e partiality for her was &s;trong and &s;incere. Mrs. Cotton's neare&s;t neighbour was Sir William Ea&s;t, baronet; and, from the joint effect of the kindne&s;s of her friend, and the ho&s;pitable and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing attentions of this re&s;pectable family, &s;he derived con&s;iderable benefit. She had been amu&s;ed and intere&s;ted in her journey to Norway; but with this difference, that, at that time, her mind perpetually returned with trembling anxiety to conjectures re&s;pecting Mr. Imlay's future conduct, whereas now, with a lofty and undaunted &s;pirit, &s;he threw a&s;ide every thought that recurred to him, while &s;he felt her&s;elf called upon to make one more effort for life and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Once after this, to my knowledge, &s;he &s;aw Mr. Imlay; probably, not long
<PB N="145" REF="152">
after her return to town. They met by accident upon the New Road; he alighted from his hor&s;e, and walked with her for &s;ome time; and the ren|counter pa&s;&s;ed, as &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, without producing in her any oppre&s;|&s;ive emotion.</P>
<P>Be it ob&s;erved, by the way, and I may be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to have known the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, &s;he never &s;poke of Mr. Imlay with acrimony, and was di&s;plea&s;ed when any per&s;on, in her hearing, expre&s;&s;ed contempt of him. She was characteri&s;ed by a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of indignation; but her emotions of this &s;ort were &s;hort-lived, and in no long time &s;ub&s;ided into a dignified &s;e|renene&s;s and equanimity.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion of her connection with Mr. Imlay, as we have &s;een, was not completely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, till March
<PB N="146" REF="153">
1796. But it is worthy to be ob|&s;erved, that &s;he did not, like ordi|nary per&s;ons under extreme angui&s;h of mind, &s;uffer her under&s;tanding, in the mean time, to &s;ink into li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and debility. The mo&s;t inapprehen&s;ive reader may conceive what was the mental torture &s;he endured, when he con&s;iders, that &s;he was twice, with an interval of four months, from the end of May to the beginning of October, prompted by it to purpo&s;es of &s;uicide. Yet in this period &s;he wrote her Letters from Norway. Shortly after its expi|ration &s;he prepared them for the pre&s;s, and they were publi&s;hed in the clo&s;e of that year. In January 1796, &s;he fini&s;h|ed the &s;ketch of a comedy, which turns, in the &s;erious &s;cenes, upon the inci|dents of her own &s;tory. It was offered to both the winter-managers, and re|mained
<PB N="147" REF="154">
among her papers at the period of her decea&s;e; but it appeared to me to be in &s;o crude and imperfect a &s;tate, that I judged it mo&s;t re&s;pectful to her memory to commit it to the flames. To under&s;tand this extraordinary de|gree of activity, we mu&s;t recollect how|ever the entire &s;olitude, in which mo&s;t of her hours were at that time con|&s;umed.</P>

<P>I AM now led, by the progre&s;s of the &s;tory, to the la&s;t branch of her hi&s;tory the connection between Mary and my|&s;elf. And this I &s;hall relate with the &s;ame &s;implicity that has pervaded every other part of my narrative. If there ever were any motives of prudence or delicacy, that could impo&s;e a qualifi|cation upon the &s;tory, they are now over. They could have no relation but to factitious rules of decorum.
<PB N="149" REF="156">
There are no circum&s;tances of her life, that, in the judgment of honour and rea&s;on, could brand her with di&s;grace. Never did there exi&s;t a human being, that needed, with le&s;s fear, expo&s;e all their actions, and call upon the uni|ver&s;e to judg&egrave; them. An event of the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ort, has awfully im|po&s;ed &s;ilence upon the gabble of fri|volity.</P>
<P>We renewed our acquaintance in January 1796, but with no particular effect, except &s;o far as &s;ympathy in her angui&s;h, added in my mind to the re&s;pect I had always entertained for her talents. It was in the clo&s;e of that month that I read her Letters from Norway; and the impre&s;&s;ion that book produced upon me has been already related.</P>
<P>It was on the fourteenth of April
<PB N="150" REF="157">
that I fir&s;t &s;aw her after her excur&s;ion into Berk&s;hire. On that day &s;he call|ed upon me in Somers Town, &s;he having, &s;ince her return, taken a lodg|ing in Cumming-&s;treet, Pentonville, at no great di&s;tance from the place of my habitation. From that time our intimacy increa&s;ed, by regular, but al|mo&s;t imperceptible degrees.</P>
<P>The partiality we conceived for each other, was in that mode, which I have always regarded as the pure&s;t and mo&s;t refined &s;tyle of love. It grew with equal advances in the mind of each. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t minute ob&s;erver to have &s;aid who was before, and who was after. One &s;ex did not take the priority which long-e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom has awarded it, nor the other over&s;tep that delicacy which is &s;o &s;everely impo&s;ed.
<PB N="151" REF="158">
I am not con&s;cious that either party can a&s;&s;ume to have been the agent or the patient, the toil-&s;preader or the prey, in the affair. When, in the cour&s;e of things, the di&s;clo&s;ure came, there was nothing, in a manner, for either party to di&s;clo&s;e to the other.</P>
<P>In July 1796 I made an excur&s;ion into the county of Norfolk, which oc|cupied nearly the whole of that month. During this period Mary removed, from Cumming-&s;treet, Pentonville, to Judd place We&s;t, which may be con|&s;idered as the extremity of Somers Town. In the former &s;ituation, &s;he had occupied a furni&s;hed lodging. She had meditated a tour to Italy or Swit|zerland, and knew not how &s;oon &s;he &s;hould &s;et out with that view. Now however &s;he felt her&s;elf reconciled to a longer abode in England, probably
<PB N="152" REF="159">
without exactly knowing why this change had taken place in her mind. She had a quantity of furniture locked up at a broker's ever &s;ince her re&s;idence in Store-&s;treet, and &s;he now found it advi&s;eable to bring it into u&s;e. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned her pre&s;ent removal.</P>
<P>The temporary &s;eparation attendant on my little journey, had its effect on the mind of both parties. It gave a &s;pace for the maturing of inclina|tion. I believe that, during this inter|val, each furni&s;hed to the other the principal topic of &s;olitary and daily contemplation. Ab&s;ence be&s;tows a refined and aerial delicacy upon affec|tion, which it with difficulty acquires in any other way. It &s;eems to re&s;em|ble the communication of &s;pirits, with|out
<PB N="153" REF="160">
the medium, or the impediment, of this earthly frame.</P>
<P>When we met again, we met with new plea&s;ure, and, I may add, with a more deci&s;ive preference for each other. It was however three weeks longer, before the &s;entiment which trembled upon the tongue, bur&s;t from the lips of either. There was, as I have already &s;aid, no period of throes and re&s;olute explanation attendant on the tale. It was friend&s;hip melting into love. Previou&s;ly to our mutual declaration, each felt half-a&s;&s;ured, yet each felt a certain trembling anxiety to have a&s;&s;urance complete.</P>
<P>Mary re&s;ted her head upon the &s;houlder of her lover, hoping to find a heart with which &s;he might &s;afely trea&s;ure her world of affection; fear|ing to commit a mi&s;take, yet, in &s;pite
<PB N="154" REF="161">
of her melancholy experience, fraught with that generous confidence, which, in a great &s;oul, is never extingui&s;hed. I had never loved till now; or, at lea&s;t, had never nouri&s;hed a pa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ame growth, or met with an object &s;o con&s;ummately worthy.</P>
<P>We did not marry. It is difficult to recommend any thing to indi&s;crimi|nate adoption, contrary to the e&s;tab|li&s;hed rules and prejudices of man|kind; but certainly nothing can be &s;o ridiculous upon the face of it, or &s;o contrary to the genuine march of &s;en|timent, as to require the overflowing of the &s;oul to wait upon a ceremo|ny, and that which, wherever delicacy and imagination exi&s;t, is of all things mo&s;t &s;acredly private, to blow a trum|pet before it, and to record the mo|ment
<PB N="155" REF="162">
when it has arrived at its cli|max.</P>
<P>There were however other rea&s;ons why we did not immediately marry. Mary felt an entire conviction of the propriety of her conduct. It would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that, with a heart withered by de&s;ertion, &s;he was not right to give way to the emotions of kindne&s;s which our intimacy produc|ed, and to &s;eek for that &s;upport in friend&s;hip and affection, which could alone give plea&s;ure to her heart, and peace to her meditations. It was only about &s;ix months &s;ince &s;he had re&s;olutely bani&s;hed every thought of Mr. Imlay; but it was at lea&s;t eighteen that he ought to have been bani&s;hed, and would have been bani&s;hed, had it not been for her &s;crupulous pertinacity in determining to leave no mea&s;ure untried
<PB N="156" REF="163">
to regain him. Add to this, that the laws of etiquette ordinarily laid down in the&s;e ca&s;es, are e&s;&s;entially ab&s;urd, and that the &s;entiments of the heart cannot &s;ubmit to be directed by the rule and the &s;quare. But Mary had an extreme aver&s;ion to be made the topic of vulgar di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and, if there be any weakne&s;s in this, the dreadful trials through which &s;he had recently pa&s;&s;ed, may well plead in its excu&s;e. She felt that &s;he had been too much, and too rudely &s;poken of, in the former in|&s;tance; and &s;he could not re&s;olve to do any thing that &s;hould immediately re|vive that painful topic.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, it is certain that I had for many years regarded marriage with &s;o well-grounded an apprehen&s;ion, that, notwith&s;tanding the partiality for Mary that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, I
<PB N="157" REF="164">
&s;hould have felt it very difficult, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our intercour&s;e, to have re&s;olved on &s;uch a mea&s;ure. Thus, partly from &s;imilar, and partly from different motives, we felt alike in this, as we did perhaps in every other circum&s;tance that related to our inter|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I have nothing further that I find it nece&s;&s;ary to record, till the commence|ment of April 1797. We then judged it proper to declare our marriage, which had taken place a little before. The principal motive for complying with this ceremony, was the circum|&s;tance of Mary's being in a &s;tate of pregnancy. She was unwilling, and perhaps with rea&s;on, to incur that ex|clu&s;ion from the &s;ociety of many valu|able and excellent individuals, which cu&s;tom awards in ca&s;es of this &s;ort. I
<PB N="158" REF="165">
&s;hould have felt an extreme repugnance to the having cau&s;ed her &s;uch an in|convenience. And, after the experi|ment of &s;even months of as intimate an intercour&s;e as our re&s;pective modes of living would admit, there was cer|tainly le&s;s hazard to either, in the &s;ub|jecting our&s;elves to tho&s;e con&s;equences which the laws of England annex to the relations of hu&s;band and wife. On the &s;ixth of April we entered into po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e, which had been taken by us in concert.</P>
<P>In this place I have a very curious cir|cum&s;tance to notice, which I am happy to have occa&s;ion to mention, as it tends to expo&s;e certain regulations of poli&s;hed &s;ociety, of which the ab&s;urdity vies with the odiou&s;ne&s;s. Mary had long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the advantage of an acquaintance
<PB N="159" REF="166">
with many per&s;ons of genius, and with others whom the effects of an inter|cour&s;e with elegant &s;ociety, combined with a certain portion of information and good &s;en&s;e, &s;ufficed to render amu&s;|ing companions. She had lately ex|tended the circle of her acquaintance in this re&s;pect; and her mind, trem|bling between the oppo&s;ite impre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;t angui&s;h and renovating tranquil|lity, found ea&s;e in this &s;pecies of recre|ation. Wherever Mary appeared, ad|miration attended upon her. She had always di&s;played talents for conver|&s;ation; but maturity of under&s;tanding, her travels, her long re&s;idence in France, the di&s;cipline of affliction, and the &s;mil|ing, new-born peace which awaked a cor|re&s;ponding &s;mile in her animated coun|tenance, inexpre&s;&s;ibly increa&s;ed them. The way in which the &s;tory of Mr. Im|lay
<PB N="160" REF="167">
was treated in the&s;e polite circles, was probably the re&s;ult of the partiality &s;he excited. The&s;e elegant per&s;onages were divided between their cautious adherence to forms, and the de&s;ire to &s;eek their own gratification. Mary made no &s;ecret of the nature of her connection with Mr. Imlay; and in one in&s;tance, I well know, &s;he put her&s;elf to the trouble of explaining it to a per|&s;on totally indifferent to her, becau&s;e he never failed to publi&s;h every thing he knew, and, &s;he was &s;ure, would re|peat her explanation to his numerous acquaintance. She was of too proud and generous a &s;pirit to &s;toop to hypo|cri&s;y. The&s;e per&s;ons however, in &s;pite of all that could be &s;aid, per&s;i&s;ted in &s;hutting their eyes, and pretending they took her for a married woman.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the con&s;equence of this!
<PB N="161" REF="168">
While &s;he was, and con&s;tantly profe&s;&s;ed to be, an unmarried mother; &s;he was fit &s;ociety for the &s;queami&s;h and the formal. The moment &s;he acknow|ledged her&s;elf a wife, and that by a marriage perhaps unexceptionable, the ca&s;e was altered. Mary and my&s;elf, ignorant as we were of the&s;e elevated refinements, &s;uppo&s;ed that our marriage would place her upon a &s;urer footing in the calendar of poli&s;hed &s;ociety, than ever. But it forced the&s;e people to &s;ee the truth, and to confe&s;s their belief of what they had carefully been told; and this they could not forgive. Be it re|marked, that the date of our marriage had nothing to do with this, that que&s;|tion being never once mentioned dur|ing this period. Mary indeed had, till now, retained the name of Imlay which had fir&s;t been a&s;&s;umed from ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="162" REF="169">
in France; but its being retain|ed thus long, was purely from the auk|wardne&s;s that attends the introduction of a change, and not from an apprehen|&s;ion of con&s;equences of this &s;ort. Her &s;crupulous explicitne&s;s as to the nature of her &s;ituation, &s;urely &s;ufficed to make the name &s;he bore perfectly immaterial.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to relate the particu|lars of &s;uch a &s;tory, but in the language of contempt and ridicule. A &s;erious reflection however upon the whole, ought to awaken emotions of a dif|ferent &s;ort. Mary retained the mo&s;t numerous portion of her acquaintance, and the majority of tho&s;e whom &s;he principally valued. It was only the &s;upporters and the &s;ubjects of the un|principled manners of a court, that &s;he lo&s;t. This however is immaterial. The tendency of the proceeding, &s;trictly
<PB N="163" REF="170">
con&s;idered, and uniformly acted upon, would have been to pro&s;cribe her from all valuable &s;ociety. And who was the per&s;on pro&s;cribed? The firme&s;t champion, and, as I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, the greate&s;t ornament her &s;ex ever had to boa&s;t! A woman, with &s;entiments as pure, as refined, and as delicate, as ever inhabited a human heart! It is fit that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould &s;tand by, that we may have room enough for the dull and in&s;olent dictators, the gamblers and demireps of poli&s;hed &s;ociety!</P>
<P>Two of the per&s;ons, the lo&s;s of who&s;e acquaintance Mary principally regret|ted upon this occa&s;ion, were Mrs. Inch|bald and Mrs. Siddons. Their ac|quaintance, it is perhaps fair to ob|&s;erve, is to be ranked among her recent acqui&s;itions. Mrs. Siddons, I am &s;ure, regretted the nece&s;&s;ity, which &s;he con|ceived
<PB N="164" REF="171">
to be impo&s;ed on her by the peculiarity of her &s;ituation, to conform to the rules I have de&s;cribed. She is endowed with that rich and generous &s;en&s;ibility, which &s;hould be&s;t enable its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or completely to feel the merits of her decea&s;ed friend. She very truly ob&s;erves, in a letter now be|fore me, that the Travels in Norway were read by no one, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of "more reciprocity of feeling, or more deeply impre&s;&s;ed with admira|tion of the writer's extraordinary powers."</P>
<P>Mary felt a tran&s;itory pang, when the conviction reached her of &s;o unex|pected a circum&s;tance, that was rather exqui&s;ite. But &s;he di&s;dained to &s;ink under the inju&s;tice (as this ultimately was) of the &s;upercilious and the fooli&s;h, and pre&s;ently &s;hook off the impre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="165" REF="172">
of the fir&s;t &s;urprize. That once &s;ub|&s;ided, I well know that the event was thought of, with no emotions, but tho&s;e of &s;uperiority to the inju&s;tice &s;he &s;u&s;|tained; and was not of force enough, to dimini&s;h a happine&s;s, which &s;eem|ed hourly to become more vigorous and firm.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to &s;ay, that no two per&s;ons ever found in each other's &s;ociety, a &s;atisfaction more pure and refined. What it was in it&s;elf, can now only be known, in its full extent, to the &s;urvivor. But, I believe, the &s;erenity of her countenance, the in|crea&s;ing &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, and that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of enjoyment that &s;eemed ambitious that every one &s;he &s;aw &s;hould be happy as well as her&s;elf, were matters of general ob&s;ervation to all her acquaintance. She had always
<PB N="166" REF="173">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an unparalleled degree, the art of communicating happine&s;s, and &s;he was now in the con&s;tant and un|limited exerci&s;e of it. She &s;eemed to have attained that &s;ituation, which her di&s;po&s;ition and character imperi|ou&s;ly demanded, but which &s;he had never before attained; and her under|&s;tanding and her heart felt the benefit of it.</P>
<P>While we lived as near neighbours only, and before our la&s;t removal, her mind had attained con&s;iderable tran|quillity, and was vi&s;ited but &s;eldom with tho&s;e emotions of angui&s;h, which had been but too familiar to her. But the improvement in this re&s;pect, which accrued upon our removal and e&s;tab|li&s;hment, was extremely obvious. She was a wor&s;hipper of dome&s;tic life. She loved to ob&s;erve the growth of
<PB N="167" REF="174">
affection between me and her daughter, then three years of age, as well as my anxiety re&s;pecting the child not yet born. Pregnancy it&s;elf, unequal as the decree of nature &s;eems to be in this re|&s;pect, is the &s;ource of a thou&s;and en|dearments. No one knew better than Mary how to extract &s;entiments of ex|qui&s;ite delight, from trifles, which a &s;u&s;picious and formal wi&s;dom would &s;carcely deign to remark. A little ride into the country with my&s;elf and the child, has &s;ometimes produced a &s;ort of opening of the heart, a general expre&s;&s;ion of confidence and affection|ate &s;oul, a &s;ort of infantine, yet dig|nified endearment, which tho&s;e who have felt may under&s;tand, but which I &s;hould in vain attempt to pourtray.</P>
<P>In addition to our dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, I was fortunate enough to introduce her
<PB N="168" REF="175">
to &s;ome of my acquaintance of both &s;exes, to whom &s;he attached her&s;elf with all the ardour of approbation and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Ours was not an idle happine&s;s, a paradi&s;e of &s;elfi&s;h and tran&s;itory plea|&s;ures. It is perhaps &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that, influenced by the ideas I had long entertained upon the &s;ubject of cohabitation, I engaged an apartment, about twenty doors from our hou&s;e in the Polygon, S&ocirc;mers Town, which I de&s;igned for the purpo&s;e of my &s;tudy and literary occupations. Trifles however will be intere&s;ting to &s;ome readers, when they relate to the la&s;t pe|riod of the life of &s;uch a per&s;on as Mary. I will add therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was po&s;&s;ible for two per&s;ons to be too uniformly in each other's &s;ociety. Influenced by
<PB N="169" REF="176">
that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have men|tioned as &s;oon as I ro&s;e, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon, till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, pre|valent in many &s;ituations in life, that a man and his wife cannot vi&s;it in mix|ed &s;ociety, but in company with each other; and we rather &s;ought occa&s;ions of deviating from, than of complying with, this rule. By the&s;e means, though, for the mo&s;t part, we &s;pent the latter half of each day in one another's &s;o|ciety, yet we were in no danger of fatiety. We &s;eemed to combine, in a con&s;iderable degree, the novelty and lively &s;en&s;ation of a vi&s;it, with the more delicious and heart-felt plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>Whatever may be thought, in other
<PB N="170" REF="177">
re&s;pects, of the plan we laid down to our&s;elves, we probably derived a real advantage from it, as to the con&s;tancy and uninterruptedne&s;s of our literary pur&s;uits. Mary had a variety of pro|jects of this &s;ort, for the exerci&s;e of her talents, and the benefit of &s;o|ciety; and, if &s;he had lived, I believe the world would have had very little rea&s;on to complain of any remi&s;&s;ion of her indu&s;try. One of her projects, which has been already mentioned, was of a &s;eries of Letters on the Manage|ment of Infants. Though &s;he had been for &s;ome time dige&s;ting her ideas on this &s;ubject with a view to the pre&s;s, I have found comparatively no|thing that &s;he had committed to paper re&s;pecting it. Another project, of longer &s;tanding, was of a &s;eries of books for the in&s;truction of children.
<PB N="171" REF="178">
A fragment &s;he left in execution of this project, is in&s;erted in her Po&s;t|humous Works.</P>
<P>But the principal work, in which &s;he was engaged for more than twelve months before her decea&s;e, was a novel, entitled, The Wrongs of Woman. I &s;hall not &s;top here to explain the na|ture of the work, as &s;o much of it as was already written, is now given to the public. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that, impre&s;&s;ed, as &s;he could not fail to be, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her talents, &s;he was de&s;irous, in this in&s;tance, that they &s;hould effect what they were capa|ble of effecting. She was &s;en&s;ible how arduous a ta&s;k it is to produce a truly excellent novel; and &s;he rou&s;ed her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers

time fully to expand. But this was written &s;lowly and with mature con&s;i|deration. She began it in &s;everal forms, which &s;he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively rejected, after they were confiderably advanced. She wrote many parts of the work again and again, and, when &s;he had fini&s;hed what &s;he intended for the fir&s;t part, &s;he felt her&s;elf more urgently &s;timulated to revi&s;e and improve what &s;he had written, than to proceed, with con&s;tancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.</P>

<P>I AM now led, by the cour&s;e of my narrative, to the la&s;t fatal &s;cene of her life. She was taken in labour on Wedne&s;day, the thirtieth of Augu&s;t. She had been &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed on the preceding Friday, the con&s;equence, I believe, of a &s;udden alarm. But from that time &s;he was in perfect health. She was &s;o far from being under any apprehen&s;ion as to the difficulties of child-birth, as frequently to ridicule
<PB N="174" REF="181">
the fa&s;hion of ladies in England, who keep their chamber for one full month after delivery. For her&s;elf, &s;he pro|po&s;ed coming down to dinner on the day immediately following. She had already had &s;ome experience on the &s;ubject in the ca&s;e of Fanny; and I cheerfully &s;ubmitted in every point to her judgment and her wi&s;dom. She hired no nur&s;e. Influenced by ideas of decorum, which certainly ought to have no place, at lea&s;t in ca&s;es of dan|ger, &s;he determined to have a woman to attend her in the capacity of mid|wife. She was &s;en&s;ible that the pro|per bu&s;ine&s;s of a midwife, in the in|&s;tance of a natural labour, is to &s;it by and wait for the operations of nature, which &s;eldom, in the&s;e affairs, demand the interpo&s;ition of art.</P>
<P>At five o'clock in the morning of the
<PB N="175" REF="182">
day of delivery, &s;he felt what &s;he con|ceived to be &s;ome notices of the ap|proaching labour. Mrs. Blenkin&s;op, matron and midwife to the We&s;tmin|&s;ter Lying in Ho&s;pital, who had &s;een Mary &s;everal times previous to her de|livery, was &s;oon after &s;ent for, and ar|rived about nine. During the whole day Mary was perfectly cheerful. Her pains came on &s;lowly; and, in the morning, &s;he wrote &s;everal notes, three addre&s;&s;ed to me, who had gone, as u&s;ual, to my apartments, for the purpo&s;e of &s;tudy. About two o'clock in the afternoon, &s;he went up to her chamber,&mdash;never more to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>The child was born at twenty mi|nutes after eleven at night. Mary had reque&s;ted that I would not come into the chamber till all was over, and &s;ig|nified her intention of then perform|ing
<PB N="176" REF="183">
the intere&s;ting office of pre&s;enting the new-born child to its father. I was &s;itting in a parlour; and it was not till after two o'clock on Thur&s;day morn|ing, that I received the alarming intel|ligence, that the placenta was not yet removed, and that the midwife dared not proceed any further, and gave her opinion for calling in a male practitioner. I accordingly went for Dr. Poignand, phy&s;ician and man-midwife to the &s;ame ho&s;pital, who arrived between three and four hours after the birth of the child. He immediately proceeded to the extraction of the placenta, which he brought away in pieces, till he was &s;atisfied that the whole was removed. In that point however it afterward, appeared that he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The period from the birth of the child till about eight o'clock the next
<PB N="177" REF="184">
morning, was a period full of peril and alarm. The lo&s;s of blood was con&s;i|derable, and produced an almo&s;t unin|terrupted &s;eries of fainting fits. I went to the chamber &s;oon after four in the morning, and found her in this &s;tate. She told me &s;ome time on Thur&s;day, "that &s;he &s;hould have died the preced|ing night, but that &s;he was determined not to leave me." She added, with one of tho&s;e &s;miles which &s;o eminently illu|minated her countenance, "that I &s;hould not be like Por&s;on," alluding to the circum&s;tance of that great man hav|ing lo&s;t his wife, after being only a few months married. Speaking of what &s;he had already pa&s;&s;ed through, &s;he de|clared, "that &s;he had never known what bodily pain was before."</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day morning Dr. Poignand repeated his vi&s;it. Mary had ju&s;t be|fore
<PB N="178" REF="185">
expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome inclination to &s;ee Dr. George Fordyce, a man probably of more &s;cience than any other medi|cal profe&s;&s;or in England, and between whom and her&s;elf there had long &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted a mutual friend&s;hip. I mentioned this to Dr. Poignand, but he rather di&s;|countenanced the idea, ob&s;erving that he &s;aw no nece&s;&s;ity for it, and that he &s;uppo&s;ed Dr. Fordyce was not particu|larly conver&s;ant with ob&s;tetrical ca&s;es; but that I would do as I plea&s;ed. After Dr. Poignand was gone, I determined to &s;end for Dr. Fordyce. He accord|ingly &s;aw the patient about three o'clock on Thur&s;day afternoon. He however perceived no particular cau&s;e of alarm; and, on that or the next day, quoted, as I am told, Mary's ca&s;e, in a mixed company, as a corrobation of a favourite idea of his, of the propriety of employ|ing
<PB N="179" REF="186">
females in the capacity of mid|wives. Mary "had had a woman, and was doing extremely well."</P>
<P>What had pa&s;&s;ed however in the night between Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;|day, had &s;o far alarmed me, that I did not quit the hou&s;e, and &s;carcely the chamber, during the following day. But my alarms wore off, as time ad|vanced. Appearances were more fa|vourable, than the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the patient would almo&s;t have permit|ted me to expect. Friday morning therefore I devoted to a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome urgency, which called me to dif|ferent parts of the town, and which, before dinner, I happily completed. On my return, and during the evening, I received the mo&s;t plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tions from the promi&s;ing &s;tate of the patient. I was now perfectly &s;atisfied
<PB N="180" REF="187">
that every thing was &s;afe, and that, if &s;he did not take cold, or &s;uffer from any external accident, her &s;peedy re|covery was certain.</P>
<P>Saturday was a day le&s;s au&s;picious than Friday, but not ab&s;olutely alarm|ing.</P>
<P>Sunday, the third of September, I now regard as the day, that finally de|cided on the fate of the object deare&s;t to my heart that the univer&s;e contain|ed. Encouraged by what I con&s;idered as the progre&s;s of her recovery, I ac|companied a friend in the morning in &s;everal calls, one of them as far as Ken&s;ington, and did not return till dinner-time. On my return I found a degree of anxiety in every face, and was told that &s;he had had a &s;ort of &s;hivering fit, and had expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome anxiety at the length of my ab&s;ence.
<PB N="181" REF="188">
My &s;i&s;ter and a friend of hers, had been engaged to dine below &s;tairs, but a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to put them off, and Mary ordered that the cloth &s;hould not be laid, as u&s;ual, in the room imme|diately under her on the fir&s;t floor, but in the ground-floor parlour. I felt a pang at having been &s;o long and &s;o un|&s;ea&s;onably ab&s;ent, and determined that I would not repeat the fault.</P>
<P>In the evening &s;he had a &s;econd &s;hivering fit, the &s;ymptoms of which were in the highe&s;t degree alarming. Every mu&s;cle of the body trembled, the teeth chattered, and the bed &s;hook under her. This continued probably for five minutes. She told me, after it was over, that it had been a &s;truggle between life and death, and that &s;he had been more than once, in the cour&s;e of it, at the point of expiring. I now

<PB N="182" REF="191">
apprehend the&s;e to have been the &s;ymp|toms of a decided mortification, occa|&s;ioned by the part of the placenta that remained in the womb. At the time however I was far from con&s;idering it in that light. When I went for Dr. Poignand, between two and three o'clock on the morning of Thur&s;day, de&s;pair was in my heart. The fact of the adhe&s;ion of the placenta was &s;tated to me; and, ignorant as I was of ob|&s;tetrical &s;cience, I felt as if the death of Mary was in a manner decided. But hope had re-vi&s;ited my bo&s;om; and her chearings were &s;o delightful, that I hugged her ob&s;tinately to my heart. I was only mortified at what appeared to me a new delay in the recovery I &s;o earne&s;tly longed for. I immediately &s;ent for Dr. Fordyce, who had been with her in the morning, as well as on
<PB N="183" REF="192">
the three preceding days. Dr. Poig|nand had al&s;o called this morning, but declined paying any further vi&s;its, as we had thought proper to call in Dr. Fordyce.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e was now uninterrupted. On Tue&s;day I found it nece&s;&s;ary again to call in Dr. Fordyce in the afternoon, who brought with him Dr. Clarke of New Burlington|&s;treet, under the idea that &s;ome opera|tion might be nece&s;&s;ary. I have already &s;aid, that I pertinaciou&s;ly per&s;i&s;ted in viewing the fair &s;ide of things; and therefore the interval between Sunday and Tue&s;day evening, did not pa&s;s without &s;ome mixture of cheerful|ne&s;s. On Monday, Dr. Fordyce forbad the child's having the brea&s;t, and we therefore procured puppies to draw off the milk. This occa&s;ioned
<PB N="184" REF="193">
&s;ome plea&s;antry of Mary with me and the other attendants. Nothing could exceed the equanimity, the patience and affectionatene&s;s of the poor &s;ufferer. I intreated her to recover; I dwelt with trembling fondne&s;s on every favourable circum&s;tance; and, as far it was po&s;&s;ible in &s;o dreadful a &s;ituation, &s;he, by her &s;miles and kind &s;peeches, rewarded my affection.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day was to me the day of greate&s;t torture in the melancholy &s;eries. It was now decided that the only chance of &s;upporting her through what &s;he had to &s;uffer, was by &s;upplying her rather freely with wine. This ta&s;k was devolved upon me. I began about four o'clock in the afternoon. But for me, totally ignorant of the na|ture of di&s;ea&s;es and of the human frame, thus to play with a life that now
<PB N="185" REF="194">
&s;eemed all that was dear to me in the univer&s;e, was too dreadful a ta&s;k. I knew neither what was too much, nor what was too little. Having begun, I felt compelled, under every di&s;advan|tage, to go on. This la&s;ted for three hours. Towards the end of that time, I happened fooli&s;hly to a&s;k the &s;ervant who came out of the room, "What &s;he thought of her mi&s;tre&s;s?" &s;he re|plied, "that, in her judgment, &s;he was going as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible." There are moments, when any creature that lives, has power to drive one into madne&s;s. I &s;eemed to know the ab&s;urdity of this reply; but that was of no con&s;e|quence. It added to the mea&s;ure of my di&s;traction. A little after &s;even I intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ated a friend to go for Mr. Carli&s;le, and bring him in&s;tantly wherever he was to be found. He had voluntarily
<PB N="186" REF="195">
called on the patient on the preceding Saturday, and two or three times &s;ince. He had &s;een her that morning, and had been earne&s;t in recommending the wine-diet. That day he dined four miles out of town, on the &s;ide of the metropolis, which was furthe&s;t from us. Notwith&s;tanding this, my friend re|turned with him after three-quarters of an hour's ab&s;ence. No one who knows my friend, will wonder either at his eagerne&s;s or &s;ucce&s;s, when I name Mr. Ba&s;il Montagu. The &s;ight of Mr. Car|li&s;le thus unexpectedly, gave me a &s;tronger alleviating &s;en&s;ation, than I thought it po&s;&s;ible to experience.</P>
<P>Mr. Carli&s;le left us no more from Wedne&s;day evening, to the hour of her death. It was impo&s;&s;ible to exceed his kindne&s;s and affectionate attention. It excited in every &s;pectator a &s;enti|ment
<PB N="187" REF="196">
like adoration. His conduct was uniformly tender and anxious, ever upon the watch, ob&s;erving every &s;ymp|tom, and eager to improve every fa|vourable appearance. If &s;kill or atten|tion could have &s;aved her, Mary would &s;till live. In addition to Mr. Carli&s;le's con&s;tant pre&s;ence, &s;he had Dr. Fordyce and Dr. Clarke every day. She had for nur&s;es, or rather for friends, watch|ing every occa&s;ion to &s;erve her, Mrs. Fenwick, author of an excellent novel, entitled Secrecy, another very kind and judicious lady, and a favourite female &s;ervant. I was &s;carcely ever out of the room. Four friends, Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Ba&s;il Montagu, Mr. Mar&s;hal, and Mr. Dy&s;on, &s;at up nearly the whole of the la&s;t week of her exi&s;tence in the hou&s;e, to be di&s;patched, on any errand, to any part of the metropolis, at a moment's warning.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="197">
Mr. Carli&s;le being in the chamber, I retired to bed for a few hours on Wed|ne&s;day night. Towards morning he came into my room with an account that the patient was &s;urpri&s;ingly bet|ter. I went in&s;tantly into the cham|ber. But I now fought to &s;uppre&s;s every idea of hope. The greate&s;t an|gui&s;h I have any conception of, con&s;i&s;ts in that cru&s;hing of a new-born hope which I had already two or three times experienced. If Mary recovered, it was well, and I &s;hould &s;ee it time enough. But it was too mighty a thought to bear being trifled with, and turned out and admitted in this abrupt way.</P>
<P>I had rea&s;on to rejoice in the firmne&s;s of my gloomy thoughts, when, about ten o'clock on Thur&s;day evening, Mr. Carli&s;le told us to prepare our&s;elves, for
<PB N="189" REF="198">
we had rea&s;on to expect the fatal event every moment. To my thinking, &s;he did not appear to be in that &s;tate of total exhau&s;tion, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to precede death; but it is probable that death does not always take place by that gradual proce&s;s I had pictured to my&s;elf; a &s;udden pang may accelerate his arrival. She did not die on Thur&s;|day night.</P>
<P>Till now it does not appear that &s;he had any &s;erious thoughts of dying; but on Friday and Saturday, the two la&s;t days of her life, &s;he occa&s;ionally &s;poke as if &s;he expected it. This was however only at intervals; the thought did not &s;eem to dwell upon her mind. Mr. Carli&s;le rejoiced in this. He ob|&s;erved, and there is great force in the &s;ugge&s;tion, that there is no more piti|able object, than a &s;ick man, that knows
<PB N="188" REF="199">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="189" REF="200">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="190" REF="201">
he is dying. The thought mu&s;t be ex|pected to de&s;troy his courage, to co|operate with the di&s;ea&s;e, and to coun|teract every favourable effort of nature.</P>
<P>On the&s;e two days her faculties were in too decayed a &s;tate, to be able to follow any train of ideas with force or any accuracy of connection. Her re|ligion, as I have already &s;hown, was not calculated to be the torment of a &s;ick bed; and, in fact, during her whole illne&s;s, not one word of a religious ca&s;t fell from her lips.</P>
<P>She was affectionate and compliant to the la&s;t. I ob&s;erved on Friday and Saturday nights, that, whenever her attendants recommended to her to &s;leep, &s;he di&s;covered her willingne&s;s to yield, by breathing, perhaps for the &s;pace of a minute, in the manner of a per&s;on that &s;leeps, though the effort,
<PB N="191" REF="202">
from the &s;tate of her di&s;order, u&s;ually proved ineffectual.</P>
<P>She was not tormented by u&s;ele&s;s contradiction. One night the &s;ervant, from an error in judgment, feazed her with idle expo&s;tulations, but &s;he com|plained of it grievou&s;ly, and it was corrected. "Pray, pray, do not let her rea&s;on with me," was her expre&s;|&s;ion. Death it&s;elf is &s;carcely &s;o dread|ful to the enfeebled frame, as the mo|notonous importunity of nur&s;es ever|la&s;tingly repeated.</P>
<P>Seeing that every hope was extinct, I was very de&s;irous of obtaining from her any directions, that &s;he might wi&s;h to have followed after her decea&s;e. Accordingly, on Saturday morning, I talked to her for a good while of the two children. In conformity to Mr. Carli&s;le's maxim of not impre&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="190" REF="203">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="191" REF="204">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="192" REF="205">
idea of death, I was obliged to manage my expre&s;&s;ions. I therefore affected to proceed wholly upon the ground of her having been very ill, and that it would be &s;ome time before &s;he could expect to be well; wi&s;hing her to tell me any thing that &s;he would choo&s;e to have done re&s;pecting the children, as they would now be principally under my care. After having repeated this idea to her in a great variety of forms, &s;he at length &s;aid, with a &s;ignificant tone of voice, "I know what you are think|ing of," but added, that &s;he had no|thing to communicate to me upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;hivering fits had cea&s;ed entirely for the two la&s;t days. Mr. Carli&s;le ob|&s;erved that her continuance was almo&s;t miraculous, and he was on the watch for favourable appearances, believing
<PB N="193" REF="206">
it highly improper to give up all hope, and remarking, that perhaps one in a million, of per&s;ons in her &s;tate might po&s;&s;ibly recover. I conceive that not one in a million, unites &s;o good a con|&s;titution of body and of mind.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the amu&s;ements of per|&s;ons in the very gulph of de&s;pair. At &s;ix o'clock on Sunday morning, Sep|tember the tenth, Mr. Carli&s;le called me from my bed to which I had re|tired at one, in conformity to my re|que&s;t, that I might not be left to re|ceive all at once the intelligence that &s;he was no more. She expired at twenty minutes before eight.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>Her remains were depo&s;ited, on the fifteenth of September, at ten o'clock in the morning, in the church-yard of
<PB N="194" REF="207">
the pari&s;h church of St. Pancras, Mid|dle&s;ex. A few of the per&s;ons &s;he mo&s;t e&s;teemed, attended the ceremony; and a plain monument is now erecting on the &s;pot, by &s;ome of her friends, with the following in&s;cription:<Q>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT GODWIN, AUTHOR OF A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN. BORN, XXVII APRIL MDCCLIX. DIED, X SEPTEMBER MDCCXCVII.</Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The lo&s;s of the world in this admir|able woman, I leave to other men to collect; my own I well know, nor can it be improper to de&s;cribe it. I do not here allude to the per&s;onal plea&s;ures I
<PB N="195" REF="208">
enjoyed in her conver&s;ation: the&s;e in|crea&s;ed every day, in proportion as we knew each other better, and as our mutual confidence increa&s;ed. They can be mea&s;ured only by the trea&s;ures of her mind, and the virtues of her heart. But this is a &s;ubject for meditation, not for words. What I purpo&s;ed alluding to, was the improvement that I have for ever lo&s;t.</P>
<P>We had cultivated our powers (if I may venture to u&s;e this &s;ort of language) in different directions; I chiefly an at|tempt at logical and metaphy&s;ical di&s;|tinction, &s;he a ta&s;te for the picture&s;que. One of the leading pa&s;&s;ions of my mind has been an anxious de&s;ire not to be deceived. This has led me to view the topics of my reflection on all &s;ides; and to examine and re-examine without end, the que&s;tions that intere&s;t me.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="209">
But it was not merely (to judge at lea&s;t from all the reports of my memory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) the difference of pro|pen&s;ities, that made the difference in our intellectual habits. I have been &s;timulated, as long as I can remember, by an ambition for intellectual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">  but, as long as I can remember, I have been di&s;couraged, when I have undeavoured to ca&s;t the &s;um of my in|tellectual value, by finding that I did not po&s;&s;e&s;s, in the degree of &s;ome other men, an intuitive perception of intel|lectual beauty. I have perhaps a &s;trong and lively &s;en&s;e of the plea&s;ures of the imagination; but I have &s;eldom been right in a&s;&s;igning to them their preportionate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, but by dint of per|&s;evering examination, and the change and correction of my fir&s;t opinions.</P>
<P>What I wanted in this re&s;pect, Mary
<PB N="197" REF="210">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a degree &s;uperior to any other per&s;on I ever knew. The &s;trength of her mind lay in intuition. She was often right, by this means only, in matters of mere &s;peculation. Her religion, her philo&s;ophy, (in both of which the errors were comparatively few, and the &s;train dignified and gene|rous) were, as I have already &s;aid, the pure re&s;ult of feeling and ta&s;te. She adopted one opinion, and rejected an|other, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, by a &s;ort of tact, and the force of a cultivated imagina|tion; and yet, though perhaps, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the term, &s;he rea|&s;oned little, it is &s;urpri&s;ing what a de|gree of &s;oundne&s;s is to be found in her determinations. But, if this quality was of u&s;e to her in topics that &s;eem the proper province of rea&s;oning, it was much more &s;o in matters directly
<PB N="198" REF="211">
appealing to the intellectual ta&s;te. In a robu&s;t and unwavering judgment of this &s;ort, there is a kind of witchcraft; when it decides ju&s;tly, it produces a re&s;pon&s;ive vibration in every ingenuous mind. In this &s;en&s;e, my ofcillation and &s;ceptici&s;m were fixed by her boldne&s;s. When a true opinion emanated in this way from another mind, the conviction produced in my own a&s;&s;umed a &s;imilar character in&s;tantaneous and firm. This &s;pecies of intellect probably differs from the other, chiefly in the relation of eariler and later. What the one per|ceives in&s;tantaneou&s;ly (circum&s;tances having produced in it, either a prema|ture attention to objects of this &s;ort, or a greater boldne&s;s of deci&s;ion) the other receives only by degrees. What it wants, &s;eems to be nothing more than a minute attention to fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="199" REF="212">
and a ju&s;t appreciation of them; habits that are never &s;o effectu|ally generated, as by the daily recur|rence of a &s;triking example.</P>
<P>This light was lent to me for a very &s;hort period, and is now extingui&s;hed for ever!</P>
<P>While I have de&s;cribed the improve|ment I was in the act of receiving, I believe I have put down the leading traits of her intellectual character.</P>
