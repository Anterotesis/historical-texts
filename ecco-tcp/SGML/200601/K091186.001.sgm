<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE purport of the following pages is an endeavour to reduce the facts belonging to ANIMAL LIFE into cla&s;&s;es, orders, genera, and &s;pecies; and, by comparing them with each other, to unravel the theory of di&s;ea&s;es. It happened, perhaps unfortunately for the in|quirers into the knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, that other &s;ciences had re|ceived improvement previous to their own; whence, in&s;tead of com|paring the properties belonging to animated nature with each other, they, idly ingenious, bu&s;ied them&s;elves in attempting to explain the laws of life by tho&s;e of mechani&s;m and chemi&s;try; they con&s;idered the body as an hydraulic machine, and the fluids as pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;eries of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was its e&s;&s;en|tial characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>The great CREATOR of all things has infinitely diver&s;ified the works of his hands, but has at the &s;ame time &s;tamped a certain &s;imilitude on the features of nature, that demon&s;trates to us, that <HI>the whole is one family of one parent.</HI> On this &s;imilitude is founded all rational analogy; which, &s;o long as it is concerned in comparing the e&s;&s;ential properties of bodies, leads us to many and important di&s;co|veries; but when with licentious activity it links together objects, otherwi&s;e di&s;cordant, by &s;ome fanciful &s;imilitude; it may indeed collect ornaments for wit and poetry, but philo&s;ophy and truth recoil from its combinations.</P>
<P>The want of a theory, deduced from &s;uch &s;trict analogy, to con|duct the practice of medicine is lamented by its profe&s;&s;ors; for, as a great number of unconnected facts are difficult to be acquired, and to be rea&s;oned from, the art of medicine is in many in&s;tances le&s;s effica|cious
<PB N="2" REF="8">
under the direction of its wi&s;e&s;t practitioners; and by that bu&s;y crowd, who either boldly wade in darkne&s;s, or are led into endle&s;s error by the glare of fal&s;e theory, it is daily practi&s;ed to the de&s;truc|tion of thou&s;ands; add to this the uncea&s;ing injury which accrues to the public by the perpetual adverti&s;ements of pretended no&s;trums; the minds of the indolent become &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fearful of di&s;ea&s;es, which they do not labour under; and thus become the daily prey of &s;ome crafty empyric.</P>
<P>A theory founded upon nature, that &s;hould bind together the &s;cat|tered facts of medical knowledge, and converge into one point of view the laws of organic life, would thus on many accounts contribute to the intere&s;t of &s;ociety. It would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practi&s;e the art of healing with real advantage to the public; it would enable every one of literary acquirements to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine di&s;ciples of medicine from tho&s;e of boa&s;tful effrontery, or of wily ad|dre&s;s; and would teach mankind in &s;ome important &s;ituations the <HI>knowledge of them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome modern practitioners, who declaim again&s;t medical theory in general, not con&s;idering that to think is to theorize; and that no one can direct a method of cure to a per&s;on labouring under di&s;ea&s;e without thinking, that is, without theorizing; and happy therefore is the patient, who&s;e phy&s;ician po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the be&s;t theory.</P>
<P>The words idea, perception, &s;en&s;ation, recollection, &s;ugge&s;tion, and a&s;&s;ociation, are each of them u&s;ed in this treati&s;e in a more li|mited &s;en&s;e than in the writers of metaphy&s;ic. The author was in doubt, whether he &s;hould rather have &s;ub&s;tituted new words in&s;tead of them; but was at length of opinion, that new definitions of words already in u&s;e would be le&s;s burthen&s;ome to the memory of the reader.</P>
<P>A great part of this work has lain by the writer above twenty years, as &s;ome of his friends can te&s;tify: he had hoped by frequent revi&s;ion to have made it more worthy the acceptance of the public;
<PB N="3" REF="9">
this however his other perpetual occupations have in part prevented, and may continue to prevent, as long as he may be capable of revi&s;|ing it; he therefore begs of the candid reader to accept of it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and to excu&s;e any inaccuracies of expre&s;&s;ion, or of con|clu&s;ion, into which the intricacy of his &s;ubject, the general imper|fection of language, or the frailty he has in common with other men, may have betrayed him; and from which he has not the va|nity to believe this treati&s;e to be exempt.</P>

<HEAD>OF MOTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE WHOLE OF NATURE may be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of two e&s;|&s;ences or &s;ub&s;tances; one of which may be termed &s;pirit, and the other matter. The former of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power to commence or produce motion, and the latter to receive and communicate it. So that motion, con&s;idered as a cau&s;e, immediately precedes every ef|fect; and, con&s;idered as an effect, it immediately &s;ucceeds every cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The MOTIONS OF MATTER may be divided into two kinds, pri|mary and &s;econdary. The &s;econdary motions are tho&s;e, which are given to or received from other matter in motion. Their laws have been &s;ucce&s;sfully inve&s;tigated by philo&s;ophers in their treati&s;es on me|chanic powers. The&s;e motions are di&s;tingui&s;hed by this circum|&s;tance, that the velocity multiplied into the quantity of matter of the body acted upon is equal to the velocity multiplied into the quantity of matter of the acting body.</P>
<P>The primary motions of matter may be divided into three cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e belonging to gravitation, to chemi&s;try, and to life; and each cla&s;s has its peculiar laws. Though the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es include the motions of &s;olid, liquid, and aerial bodies; there is neverthele&s;s a fourth divi&s;ion of motions; I mean tho&s;e of the &s;uppo&s;ed ethereal fluids of magneti&s;m, electricity, heat, and light; who&s;e properties are not &s;o well inve&s;tigated as to be cla&s;&s;ed with &s;ufficient accuracy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="16">
1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The gravitating motions include the annual and diurnal rota|tion of the earth and planets, the flux and reflux of the ocean, the de&s;cent of heavy bodies, and other phaenomena of gravitation The unparalleled &s;agacity of the great NEWTON has deduced the laws of this cla&s;s of motions from the &s;imple principle of the general attrac|tion of matter. The&s;e motions are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their tendency to or from the centers of the &s;un or planets.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> The chemical cla&s;s of motions includes all the various appear|ances of chemi&s;try. Many of the facts, which belong to the&s;e branches of &s;cience, are nicely a&s;certained and elegantly cla&s;&s;ed; but their laws have not yet been developed from &s;uch &s;imple principles as tho&s;e above-mentioned; though it is probable, that they depend on the &s;pe|cific attractions belonging to the particles of bodies, or to the differ|ence of the quantity of attraction belonging to the &s;ides and angles of tho&s;e particles. The chemical motions are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their be|ing generally attended with an evident decompo&s;ition or new combi|nation of the active materials.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> The third cla&s;s includes all the motions of the animal and ve|getable world; as well tho&s;e of the ve&s;&s;els, which circulate their juices, and of the mu&s;cles, which perform their locomotion, as tho&s;e of the organs of &s;en&s;e, which con&s;titute their ideas.</P>
<P>This la&s;t cla&s;s of motion is the &s;ubject of the following pages; which, though con&s;cious of their many imperfections, I hope may give &s;ome plea&s;ure to the patient reader, and contribute &s;omething to the knowledge and to the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER>As &s;ome explanations and definitions will be nece&s;&s;ary in the pro&s;ecution of the work, the reader is troubled with them in this place, and is intreated to keep them in his mind as he proceeds, and to take them for granted, till an apt opportunity occurs to evince their truth; to which I &s;hall pre|mi&s;e a very &s;hort outline of the animal economy.</OPENER>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I.&mdash;1. THE nervous &s;y&s;tem has its origin from the brain, and is di&s;tributed to every part of the body. Tho&s;e nerves, which &s;erve the &s;en&s;es, principally ari&s;e from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the head; and tho&s;e, which &s;erve the purpo&s;es of mu&s;cular motion, principally ari&s;e from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the neck and back, and which is erroneou&s;ly called the &s;pinal marrow. The ultimate fibrils of the&s;e nerves terminate in the immediate or|gans of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cular fibres, and if a ligature be put on any part of their pa&s;&s;age from the head or &s;pine, all motion and perception cea&s;e in the parts beneath the ligature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The longitudinal mu&s;cular fibres compo&s;e the locomotive mu&s;|cles, who&s;e contractions move the bones of the limbs and trunk, to which their extremities are attached. The annular or &s;piral mu&s;cu|lar
<PB N="8" REF="18">
fibres compo&s;e the va&s;cular mu&s;cles, which con&s;titute the inte&s;|tinal canal, the arteries, veins, glands, and ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="3">3. The immediate organs of &s;en&s;e, as the retina of the eye, pro|bably con&s;i&s;t of moving fibrils, with a power of contraction &s;imilar to that of the larger mu&s;cles above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P N="4">4. The cellular membrane con&s;i&s;ts of cells, which re&s;emble tho&s;e of a &s;ponge, communicating with each other, and connecting toge|ther all the other parts of the body.</P>
<P N="5">5. The arterial &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ts of the aortal and the pulmonary ar|tery, which are attended through their whole cour&s;e with their cor|re&s;pondent veins. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right chamber of the heart, and carries it to the minute exten&s;ive ramifications of the lungs, where it is expo&s;ed to the action of the air on a &s;urface equal to that of the whole external &s;kin, through the thin moi&s;t coats of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which are &s;pread on the air-cells, which con&s;titute the minute terminal ramifications of the wind-pipe. Here the blood changes its colour from a dark red to a bright &s;carlet. It is then collected by the branches of the pulmonary vein, and con|veyed to the left chamber of the heart.</P>
<P N="6">6. The aorta is another large artery, which receives the blood from the left chamber of the heart, after it has been thus aerated in the lungs, and conveys it by a&s;cending and de&s;cending branches to every other part of the &s;y&s;tem; the extremities of this artery termi|nate either in glands, as the &s;alivary glands, lacrymal glands, &amp;c. or in capillary ve&s;&s;els, which are probably le&s;s involuted glands; in the&s;e &s;ome fluid, as &s;aliva, tears, per&s;piration, are &s;eparated from the blood; and the remainder of the blood is ab&s;orbed or drank up by branches of veins corre&s;pondent to the branches of the artery; which are furni&s;hed with valves to prevent its return; and is thus carried back, after having again changed its colour to a dark red, to the right chamber of the heart. The circulation of the blood in the liver differs from this general &s;y&s;tem; for the veins which drink up the re|fluent
<PB N="9" REF="19">
blood from tho&s;e arteries, which are &s;pread on the bowels and me&s;entery, unite into a trunk in the liver, and form a kind of ar|tery, which is branched into the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the liver, and is called the vena portarum; and from which the bile is &s;eparated by the numerous hepatic glands, which con&s;titute that vi&s;cus.</P>

Secondly, the glands without convolution, as the ca|pillary ve&s;&s;els, which unite the terminations of the arteries and veins; and &s;eparate both the mucus, which lubricates the cellular membrane, and the per&s;pirable matter, which pre&s;erves the &s;kin moi&s;t and flexible.

<P>The&s;e lacteal and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are furni&s;hed with numerous valves to prevent the return of the fluids, which they ab&s;orb, and terminate in glands, called lymphatic glands, and may hence be con|&s;idered as long necks or mouths belonging to the&s;e glands. To the&s;e they convey the chyle and mucus, with a part of the per&s;pirable mat|ter, and atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture; all which, after having pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e glands, and having &s;uffered &s;ome change in them, are carried forward into the blood, and &s;upply perpetual nouri&s;hment to the &s;y&s;|tem, or replace its hourly wa&s;te.</P>
<P N="8">8. The &s;tomach and inte&s;tinal canal have a con&s;tant vermicular motion, which carries forwards their contents, after the lacteals have drank up the chyle from them; and which is excited into ac|tion by the &s;timulus of the aliment we &s;wallow, but which becomes occa&s;ionally inverted or retrograde, as in vomiting, and in the iliac pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P N="1">II. 1. The word <HI>&s;en&s;orium</HI> in the following pages is de&s;igned to expre&s;s not only the medullary part of the brain, &s;pinal marrow, nerves, organs of &s;en&s;e, and of the mu&s;cles; but al&s;o at the &s;ame time that living principle, or &s;pirit of animation, which re&s;ides throughout the body, without being cognizable to our &s;en&s;es, except by its effects. The changes which occa&s;ionally take place in the &s;en&s;orium, as during the exertions of volition, or the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, are termed <HI>&s;en&s;orial motions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;imilarity of the texture of the brain to that of the pan|creas, and &s;ome other glands of the body, has induced the inquirers into this &s;ubject to believe, that a fluid, perhaps much more &s;ubtile than the electric aura, is &s;eparated from the blood by that organ for the purpo&s;es of motion and &s;en&s;ation. When we recollect, that the electric fluid it&s;elf is actually accumulated and given out voluntarily by the torpedo and the gymnotus electricus, that an electric &s;hock will frequently &s;timulate into motion a paralytic limb, and la&s;tly that it needs no perceptible tubes to convey it, this opinion &s;eems not without probability; and the &s;ingular figure of the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;eems well adapted to di&s;tribute it over every part of the body.</P>
<P>For the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain not only occupies the ca|vities of the head and &s;pine, but pa&s;&s;es along the innumerable ramifi|cations of the nerves to the various mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e. In the&s;e it lays a&s;ide its coverings, and is intermixed with the &s;lender fibres, which con&s;titute tho&s;e mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e. Thus all the&s;e di&s;tant ramifications of the &s;en&s;orium are united at one of their extremities, that is, in the head and &s;pine; and thus the&s;e central parts of the &s;en&s;orium con&s;titute a communication between all the or|gans of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cles.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>nerve</HI> is a continuation of the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain from the head or &s;pine towards the other parts of the body, wrapped in its proper membrane.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>mu&s;cular fibres</HI> are moving organs intermixed with that
<PB N="11" REF="21">
medullary &s;ub&s;tance which is continued along the nerves, as men|tioned above. They are indued with the power of contraction, and are again elongated either by antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles, by circulating fluids, or by ela&s;tic ligaments. So the mu&s;cles on one &s;ide of the fore|arm bend the fingers by means of their tendons, and tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the fore-arm extend them again. The arteries are di&s;|tended by the circulating blood; and in the necks of quadrupeds there is a &s;trong ela&s;tic ligament, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts the mu&s;cles, which elevate the head, to keep it in its horizontal po&s;ition, and to rai&s;e it after it has been depre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>immediate organs of &s;en&s;e</HI> con&s;i&s;t in like manner of moving fibres enveloped in the medullary &s;ub&s;tance above mentioned; and are erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;imply an expan&s;ion of the nervous me|dulla, as the retina of the eye, and the rete muco&s;um of the &s;kin, which are the immediate organs of vi&s;ion, and of touch. Hence when we &s;peak of the contractions of the fibrous parts of the body, we &s;hall mean both the contractions of the mu&s;cles, and tho&s;e of the immediate organs of &s;en&s;e. The&s;e <HI>fibrous motions</HI> are thus di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the <HI>&s;en&s;orial motions</HI> above mentioned.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>external organs</HI> of &s;en&s;e are the coverings of the immediate organs of &s;en&s;e, and are mechanically adapted for the reception or tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of peculiar bodies, or of their qualities, as the cornea and humours of the eye, the tympanum of the ear, the cuticle of the &s;ingers and tongue.</P>
<P N="7">7. The word <HI>idea</HI> has various meanings in the writers of metaphy|&s;ic: it is here u&s;ed &s;imply for tho&s;e notions of external things, which our organs of &s;en&s;e bring us acquainted with originally; and is defined a contraction, or motion, or configuration, of the fibres, which con&s;titute the immediate organ of &s;en&s;e; which will be ex|plained at large in another part of the work. Synonymous with the word idea, we &s;hall &s;ometimes u&s;e the words <HI>&s;en&s;ual motion</HI> in con|tradi&s;tinction to <HI>mu&s;cular motion.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="12" REF="22">
8.

<P N="9">9. The plea&s;ure or pain which nece&s;&s;arily accompanies all tho&s;e perceptions or ideas which we attend to, either gradually &s;ub&s;ides, or is &s;ucceeded by other fibrous motions.

<P N="10">10. The vulgar u&s;e of the word <HI>memory</HI> is too unlimited for our purpo&s;e: tho&s;e ideas which we voluntarily recall are here termed ideas of <HI>recollection,</HI> as when we will to repeat the alphabet back|wards.

<P N="11">11. The word <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> properly &s;ignifies a &s;ociety or convention of things in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;imilar to each other. We never &s;ay in common language, that the effect is a&s;&s;ociated with the cau&s;e, though they nece&s;&s;arily accompany or &s;ucceed each other. Thus the con|tractions of our mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e may be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;ociated together, but cannot with propriety be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;ociated with irri|tations, or with volition, or with &s;en&s;ation; becau&s;e they are cau&s;ed by them, as mentioned in Sect. IV. When fibrous contractions &s;ucceed other fibrous contractions, the connection is termed <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI>; when fibrous contractions &s;ucceed &s;en&s;orial motions, the connection is termed <HI>ca&s;&s;ation</HI>; when fibrous and &s;en&s;orial motions reciprocally in|troduce each other in progre&s;&s;ive trains or tribes, it is termed <HI>catena|tion</HI>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>BEFORE the great variety of animal motions can be duly ar|ranged into natural cla&s;&s;es and orders, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;mooth the way to this yet unconquered field of &s;cience, by removing &s;ome ob|&s;tacles which thwart our pa&s;&s;age. I. To demon&s;trate that the retina and other immediate organs of &s;en&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of motion, and that the&s;e motions con&s;titute our ideas, according to the fifth and &s;eventh of the preceding a&s;&s;ertions, claims our fir&s;t attention.</P>
<P>Animal motions are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the communicated motions,
<PB N="15" REF="25">
mentioned in the fir&s;t &s;ection, as they have no mechanical proportion to their cau&s;e; for the goad of a &s;pur on the &s;kin of a hor&s;e &s;hall induce him to move a load of hay. They differ from the gravitating mo|tions there mentioned as they are exerted with equal facility in all di|rections, and they differ from the chemical cla&s;s of motions, becau&s;e no apparent decompo&s;itions or new combinations are produced in the moving materials.</P>
<P>Hence, when we &s;ay animal motion is excited by irritation, we do not mean that the motion bears any proportion to the mechanical im|pul&s;e of the &s;timulus; nor that it is affected by the general gravitation of the two bodies; nor by their chemical properties, but &s;olely that certain animal fibres are excited into action by &s;omething external to the moving organ.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e the &s;timulus of the blood produces the contractions of the heart; and the &s;ub&s;tances we take into our &s;tomach and bowels irritate them to perform their nece&s;&s;ary functions. The rays of light excite the retina into animal motion by their &s;timulus; at the &s;ame time that tho&s;e rays of light them&s;elves are phy&s;ically converged to a focus by the inactive humours of the eye. The vibrations of the air irritate the auditory nerve into animal action; while it is probable that the tympanum of the ear at the &s;ame time undergoes a mecha|nical vibration.</P>
<P>To render this circum&s;tance more ea&s;y to be comprehended, <HI>mo|tion may be defined to be a variation of figure</HI>; for the whole univer&s;e may be con&s;idered as one thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a certain figure; the mo|tions of any of its parts are a variation of this figure of the whole: this definition of motion will be further explained in Section XIV. 2. 2. on the production of ideas.</P>
<P>Now the motions of an organ of &s;en&s;e are a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of configur|ations of that organ; the&s;e configurations &s;ucceed each other quicker or &s;lower; and whatever configuration of this organ of &s;en&s;e, that is, whatever portion of the motion of it is, or has u&s;ually been, attended
<PB N="16" REF="26">
to, con&s;titutes an idea. Hence the configuration is not to be con&s;i|dered as an effect of the motion of the organ, but rather as a part or temporary termination of it; and that, whether a pau&s;e &s;ucceeds it, or a new configuration immediately takes place. Thus when a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of moving objects are pre&s;ented to our view, the ideas of trumpets, horns, lords and ladies, trains and canopies, are confi|gurations, that is, parts or links of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions of the or|gan of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e motions or configurations of the organs of &s;en&s;e differ from the &s;en&s;orial motions to be de&s;cribed hereafter, as they appear to be &s;imply contractions of the fibrous extremities of tho&s;e organs, and in that re&s;pect exactly re&s;emble the motions or contractions of the larger mu&s;cles, as appears from the following experiment. Place a circular piece of red &s;ilk about an inch in diameter on a &s;heet of white paper in a &s;trong light, as in Plate I.&mdash;look for a minute on this area, or till the eye becomes &s;omewhat fatigued, and then, gently clo&s;ing your eyes, and &s;hading them with your hand, a circular green area of the &s;ame apparent diameter becomes vi&s;ible in the clo&s;ed eye. This green area is the colour rever&s;e to the red area, which had been pre|viou&s;ly in&s;pected, as explained in the experiments on ocular &s;pectra at the end of the work, and in Botanical Garden, P. I. additional note, No. I. Hence it appears, that a part of the retina, which had been fatigued by contraction in one direction, relieves it&s;elf by exert|ing the antagoni&s;t fibres, and producing a contraction in an oppo&s;ite direction, as is common in the exertions of our mu&s;cles. Thus when we are tired with long action of our arms in one direction, as in hold|ing a bridle on a journey, we occa&s;ionally throw them into an oppo|&s;ite po&s;ition to relieve the fatigued mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke has de&s;ined an idea to be "whatever is pre&s;ent to the mind;" but this would include the exertions of volition, and the &s;en|&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain, as well as tho&s;e operations of our &s;y&s;|tem, which acquaint us with external objects; and is therefore too
<PB N="17" REF="27">
unlimited for our purpo&s;e. Mr. Lock &s;eems to have fallen into a further error, by conceiving, that the mind could form a general or ab&s;tract idea by its own operation, which was the copy of no parti|cular perception; as of a triangle in general, that was neither acute, obtu&s;e, nor right angled. The ingenious Dr. Berkley and Mr. Hume have demon&s;trated, that &s;uch general ideas have no exi&s;tence in nature, not even in the mind of their celebrated inventor. We &s;hall therefore take for granted at pre&s;ent, that our recollection or imagination of external objects con&s;i&s;ts of a partial repetition of the perceptions, which were excited by tho&s;e external objects, at the time we became acquainted with them; and that our reflex ideas of the operations of our minds are partial repetitions of tho&s;e opera|tions.</P>

<P>II. The following article evinces that the organ of vi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of a fibrous part as well as of the nervous medulla, like other white mu&s;cles; and hence, as it re&s;embles the mu&s;cular parts of the body in its &s;tructure, we may conclude, that it mu&s;t re&s;emble them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power of being excited into animal motion.&mdash;The &s;ub|&s;equent experiments on the optic nerve, and on the colours remaining in the eye, are copied from a paper on ocular &s;pectra publi&s;hed in the &s;eventy-&s;ixth volume of the Philo&s;. Tran&s;. by Dr. R. Darwin of Shrew&s;bury; which, as I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to refer to, is reprinted in this work, Sect. XL. The retina of an ox's eye was &s;u&s;pended in a gla&s;s of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; the edges of the&s;e parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not con|tract and become &s;mooth like &s;imple mucus, when it is di&s;tended till it breaks; which evinced that it con&s;i&s;ted of fibres. This fibrous con&s;truction became &s;till more di&s;tinct to the &s;ight by adding &s;ome cau&s;tic alcali to the water; as the adhering mucus was fir&s;t eroded, and the hair-like fibres remained floating in the ve&s;&s;el. Nor does the degree of tran&s;parency of the retina invalidate this evidence of its fi|brous

<P>Hence it appears, that as the mu&s;cles con&s;i&s;t of larger fibres inter|mixed with a &s;maller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vi|&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of a greater quantity of nervous medulla intermixed with &s;maller fibres. It is probable that the locomotive mu&s;cles of micro|&s;copic animals may have greater tenuity than the&s;e of the retina; and there is rea&s;on to conclude from analogy, that the other immediate organs of &s;en&s;e, as the portio mollis of the auditory nerve, and the rete muco&s;um of the &s;kin, po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;imilarity of &s;tructure with the retina, and a &s;imilar power of being excited into animal motion.</P>

<P>III. The &s;ub&s;equent articles &s;hew, that neither mechanical im|pre&s;&s;ions, nor chemical combinations of light, but that the animal activity of the retina con&s;titutes vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. Much has been conjectured by philo&s;ophers about the momen|tum of the rays of light; to &s;ubject this to experiment a very light horizontal balance was con&s;tructed by Mr. Michel, with about an inch &s;quare of thin leaf-copper &s;u&s;pended at each end of it, as de|&s;cribed in Dr. Prie&s;tley's Hi&s;tory of Light and Colours. The focus of a very large convex mirror was thrown by Dr. Powel, in his lec|tures on experimental philo&s;ophy, in my pre&s;ence, on one wing of this delicate balance, and it receded from the light; thrown on the other wing, it approached towards the light, and this repeatedly; &s;o that no &s;en&s;ible impul&s;e could be ob&s;erved, but what might well be a&s;cribed to the a&s;cent of heated air.</P>
<P>Whence it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that the light of the day mu&s;t be much too weak in its dilute &s;tate to make any mechanical impre&s;|&s;ion on &s;o tenacious a &s;ub&s;tance as the retina of the eye.&mdash;Add to this, that as the retina is nearly tran&s;parent, it could therefore make le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance to the mechanical impul&s;e of light; which, according to the ob&s;ervations related by Mr. Melvil in the Edinburgh Literary
<PB N="19" REF="29">
E&s;&s;ays, only communicates heat, and &s;hould therefore only commu|nicate momentum, where it is ob&s;tructed, reflected, or refracted.&mdash;From whence al&s;o may be collected the final cau&s;e of this degree of tran&s;parency of the retina, viz. lea&s;t by the focus of &s;tronger lights, heat and pain &s;hould have been produced in the retina, in&s;tead of that &s;timulus which excites it into animal motion.</P>
<P N="2">2. On looking long on an area of &s;carlet &s;ilk of about an inch in diameter laid on white paper, as in Plate I. the &s;carlet colour be|comes fainter, till at length it entirely vani&s;hes, though the eye is kept uniformly and &s;teadily upon it. Now if the change or motion of the retina was a mechanical impre&s;&s;ion, or a chemical tinge of coloured light, the perception would every minute become &s;tronger and &s;tronger,&mdash;whereas in this experiment it becomes every in&s;tant weaker and weaker. The &s;ame circum&s;tance obtains in the conti|nued application of &s;ound, or of &s;apid bodies, or of odorous ones, or of tangible ones, to their adapted organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus when a circular coin, as a &s;hilling, is pre&s;&s;ed on the palm of the hand, the &s;en&s;e of touch is mechanically compre&s;&s;ed; but it is the &s;timulus of this pre&s;&s;ure that excites the organ of touch into ani|mal action, which con&s;titutes the perception of hardne&s;s and of figure: for in &s;ome minutes the perception cea&s;es, though the mechanical pre&s;&s;ure of the object remains.</P>
<P N="3">3. Make with ink on white paper a very black &s;pot about half an inch in diameter, with a tail about an inch in length, &s;o as to re&s;em|ble a tadpole, as in Plate II.; look &s;teadfa&s;tly for a minute on the center of this &s;pot, and, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the tadpole will be &s;een on the white part of the paper; which figure of the tadpole will appear more luminous than the other part of the white paper; which can only be explained by &s;uppo&s;ing that a part of the retina, on which the tadpole was delineated, to have become more &s;en&s;ible to light than the other parts of it, which were expo&s;ed to the

white paper; and not from any idea of mechanical impre&s;&s;ion or che|mical combination of light with the retina.</P>
<P N="4">4. When any one turns round rapidly, till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon the ground, the &s;pectra of the ambient objects continue to pre&s;ent them&s;elves in rotation, and he &s;eems to behold the objects &s;till in motion. Now if the&s;e &s;pectra were impre&s;&s;ions on a pa&s;&s;ive organ, they either mu&s;t continue as they were received la&s;t, or not continue at all.</P>
<P N="5">5. Place a piece of red &s;ilk about an inch in diameter on a &s;heet of white paper in a &s;trong light, as in Plate I.; look &s;teadily upon it from the di&s;tance of about half a yard for a minute; then clo&s;ing your eye-lids, cover them with your hands and handkerchief, and a green &s;pectrum will be &s;een in your eyes re&s;embling in form the piece of red &s;ilk. After &s;ome &s;econds of time the &s;pectrum will di&s;|appear, and in a few more &s;econds will reappear; and thus alter|nately three or four times, if the experiment be well made, till at length it vani&s;hes entirely.</P>

Place a circular piece of white paper, about four inches in di|ameter, in the &s;un&s;hine, cover the center of this with a circular piece of black &s;ilk, about three inches in diameter; and the center of the black &s;ilk with a circle of pink &s;ilk, about two inches in dia|meter; and the center of the pink &s;ilk with a circle of yellow &s;ilk, about one inch in diameter; and the center of this with a circle of blue &s;ilk, about half an inch in diameter; make a &s;mall &s;pot with ink in the center of the blue &s;ilk, as in Plate III. look &s;teadily for a mi|nute on this central &s;pot, and then clo&s;ing your eyes, and applying your hand at about an inch di&s;tance before them, &s;o as to prevent too much or too little light from pa&s;&s;ing through the eye-lids, and you will &s;ee the mo&s;t beautiful circles of colours that imagination can con|ceive; which are mo&s;t re&s;embled by the colours occa&s;ioned by pour|ing a drop or two of oil on a &s;till lake in a bright day.

<P>IV. The &s;ub&s;equent articles &s;hew, that the&s;e animal motions or configurations of our organs of &s;en&s;e con&s;titute our ideas.</P>
<P N="1">1. If any one in the dark pre&s;&s;es the ball of his eye, by applying his finger to the external corner of it, a luminous appearance is ob|&s;erved; and by a &s;mart &s;troke on the eye great fla&s;hes of fire are per|ceived. (Newton's Optics.) So that when the arteries, that are near the auditory nerve, make &s;tronger pul&s;ations than u&s;ual, as in &s;ome fevers, an undulating &s;ound is excited in the ears. Hence it is not the pre&s;ence of the light and &s;ound, but the motions of the organ, that are immediately nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the perception or idea of light and &s;ound.</P>
<P N="2">2. During the time of &s;leep, or in delirium, the ideas of imagina|tion are mi&s;taken for the perceptions of external objects; whence it appears, that the&s;e ideas of imagination are no other than a reiteration of tho&s;e motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, which were originally ex|cited by the &s;timulus of external objects: and in our waking hours
<PB N="22" REF="34">
the &s;imple ideas, that we call up by recollection or by imagination, as the colour of red, or the &s;mell of a ro&s;e, are exact re&s;emblances of the &s;ame &s;imple ideas from perception; and in con&s;equence mu&s;t be a repetition of tho&s;e very motions.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation called the tooth-edge is originally excited by the painful jarring of the teeth in biting the edge of the gla&s;s, or porcelain cup, in which our food was given us in our in|fancy, as is further explained in the Section XVI. 10, on In&s;tinct.&mdash;This di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is afterwards excitable not only by a repe|tition of the &s;ound, that was then produced, but by imagination alone, as I have my&s;elf frequently experienced; in this ca&s;e the idea of bit|ing a china cup, when I imagine it very di&s;tinctly, or when I &s;ee an|other per&s;on bite a cup or gla&s;s, excites an actual pain in the nerves of my teeth. So that this idea and pain &s;eem to be nothing more than the reiterated motions of tho&s;e nerves, that were formerly &s;o di&s;agreeably affected.</P>
<P>Other ideas that are excited by imagination or recollection in many in&s;tances produce &s;imilar effects on the con&s;titution, as our percep|tions had formerly produced, and are therefore undoubtedly a repe|tition of the &s;ame motions. A &s;tory which the celebrated Baron Van Swieton relates of him&s;elf is to this purpo&s;e. He was pre&s;ent when the putrid carca&s;e of a dead dog exploded with prodigious &s;tench; and &s;ome years afterwards, accidentally riding along the &s;ame road, he was thrown into the &s;ame &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting by the idea of the &s;tench, as he had before experienced from the perception of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Where the organ of &s;en&s;e is totally de&s;troyed, the ideas which were received by that organ &s;eem to peri&s;h along with it, as well as the power of perception. Of this a &s;atisfactory in&s;tance has fallen under my ob&s;ervation. A gentleman about &s;ixty years of age had been totally deaf for near thirty years: he appeared to be a man of good under&s;tanding, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with reading, and by con|ver&s;ing either by the u&s;e of the pen, or by &s;igns made with his fin|gers,
<PB N="23" REF="35">
to repre&s;ent letters. I ob&s;erved that he had &s;o far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when he attempted to &s;peak, none of his words had di&s;tinct articulation, though his relations could &s;ometimes under&s;tand his meaning. But, which is much to the point, he a&s;&s;ured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that people conver&s;ed with him by &s;igns or writing, and never that he heard any one &s;peak to him. From hence it appears, that with the perceptions of &s;ounds he has al&s;o lo&s;t the ideas of them; though the organs of &s;peech &s;till retain &s;omewhat of their u&s;ual habits of articu|lation.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation may throw &s;ome light on the medical treatment of deaf people; as it may be learnt from their dreams whether the auditory nerve be paralytic, or their deafne&s;s be owing to &s;ome de|fect of the external organ.</P>
<P>It rarely happens that the immediate organ of vi&s;ion is perfectly de&s;troyed. The mo&s;t frequent cau&s;es of blindne&s;s are occa&s;ioned by defects of the external organ, as in cateracts and obfu&s;cations of the cornea. But I have had the opportunity of conver&s;ing with two men, who had been &s;ome years blind; one of them had a complete gutta &s;erena, and the other had lo&s;t the whole &s;ub&s;tance of his eyes. They both told me that they did not remember to have ever dreamt of vi&s;ible objects, &s;ince the total lo&s;s of their &s;ight.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<P>V. Another method of di&s;covering that our ideas are animal mo|tions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, is from con&s;idering the great analogy they bear to the motions of the larger mu&s;cles of the body. In the following articles it will appear that they are originally excited into action by the irritation of external objects like our mu&s;cles; are a&s;&s;o|ciated together like our mu&s;cular motions; act in &s;imilar time with them; are fatigued by continued exertion like them; and that the organs of &s;en&s;e are &s;ubject to inflammation, numbne&s;s, pal&s;y, con|vul&s;ion, and the defects of old age, in the &s;ame manner as the mu&s;|cular fibres.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="36">
1. All our perceptions or ideas of external objects are univer&s;ally allowed to have been originally excited by the &s;timulus of tho&s;e ex|ternal objects; and it will be &s;hewn in a &s;ucceeding &s;ection, that it is probable that all our mu&s;cular motions, as well tho&s;e that are become voluntary as tho&s;e of the heart and glandular &s;y&s;tem, were originally in like manner excited by the &s;timulus of &s;omething external to the organ of motion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our ideas are al&s;o a&s;&s;ociated together after their production pre|ci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner as our mu&s;cular motions; which will likewi&s;e be fully explained in the &s;ucceeding &s;ection.</P>
<P N="3">3. The time taken up in performing an idea is likewi&s;e much the &s;ame as that taken up in performing a mu&s;cular motion. A mu&s;i|cian can pre&s;s the keys of an harp&s;ichord with his fingers in the or|der of a tune he has been accu&s;tomed to play, in as little time as he can run over tho&s;e notes in his mind. So we many times in an hour cover our eye-balls with our eye-lids without perceiving that we are in the dark; hence the perception or idea of light is not changed for that of darkne&s;s in &s;o &s;mall a time as the twinkling of an eye; &s;o that in this ca&s;e the mu&s;cular motion of the eye-lid is performed quicker than the perception of light can be changed for that of darkne&s;s.&mdash;So if a fire-&s;tick be whirled round in the dark, a luminous circle appears to the ob&s;erver; if it be whirled &s;omewhat &s;lower, this circle be|comes interrupted in one part; and then the time taken up in &s;uch a revolution of the &s;tick is the &s;ame that the ob&s;erver u&s;es in changing his ideas: thus the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of Homer, the long &s;hadow of the flying javelin, is elegantly de&s;igned to give us an idea of its velo|city, and not of its length.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fatigue that follows a continued attention of the mind to one object is relieved by changing the &s;ubject of our thoughts; as the continued movement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its &s;tead. Whereas a due exerci&s;e of the faculties of the mind &s;trengthens and improves tho&s;e faculties, whether of imagination or
<PB N="25" REF="37">
recollection; as the exerci&s;e of our limbs in dancing or fencing in|crea&s;es the &s;trength and agility of the mu&s;cles thus employed.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the mu&s;cles of any limb are inflamed, they do not move without pain; &s;o when the retina is inflamed, its motions al&s;o are painful. Hence light is as intolerable in this kind of ophthalmia, as pre&s;&s;ure is to the finger in the paronychia. In this di&s;ea&s;e the patients frequently dream of having their eyes painfully dazzled; hence the idea of &s;trong light is painful as well as the reality. The fir&s;t of the&s;e facts evinces that our perceptions are motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e; and the latter, that our imaginations are al&s;o motions of the &s;ame organs.</P>
<P N="6">6. The organs of &s;en&s;e, like the moving mu&s;cles, are liable to be|come benumbed, or le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, from compre&s;&s;ion. Thus, if any per&s;on on a light day looks on a white wall, he may perceive the ra|mifications of the optic artery, at every pul&s;ation of it, repre&s;ented by darker branches on the white wall; which is evidently owing to its compre&s;&s;ing the retina during the dia&s;tole of the artery. Savage No&s;olog.</P>
<P N="7">7. The organs of &s;en&s;e and the moving mu&s;cles are alike liable to be affected with pal&s;y, as in the gutta &s;erena, and in &s;ome ca&s;es of deafne&s;s; and one &s;ide of the face has &s;ometimes lo&s;t its power of &s;en|&s;ation, but retained its power of motion; other parts of the body have lo&s;t their motions but retained their &s;en&s;ation, as in the common he|miplagia; and in other in&s;tances both the&s;e powers have peri&s;hed together.</P>
<P N="8">8. In &s;ome convul&s;ive di&s;ea&s;es a delirium or in&s;anity &s;upervenes, and the convul&s;ions cea&s;e; and conver&s;ely the convul&s;ions &s;hall &s;uper|vene, and the delirium cea&s;e. Of this I have been a witne&s;s many times in a day in the paroxy&s;ms of violent epilep&s;ies; which evinces that one kind of delirium is a convul&s;ion of the organs of &s;en&s;e, and that our ideas are the motions of the&s;e organs: the &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es will illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation.</P>

<P N="1">VI. 1. In oppo&s;ition to this doctrine of the production of our ideas, it may be a&s;ked, if &s;ome of our ideas, like other animal motions, are voluntary, why can we not invent new ones, that have not been re|ceived by perception? The an&s;wer will be better under&s;tood after having peru&s;ed the &s;ucceeding &s;ection, where it will be explained, that the mu&s;cular motions likewi&s;e are originally excited by the &s;timulus of bodies external to the moving organ; and that the will has only the power of repeating the motions thus excited.</P>

that excite them; it has generally been believed that they do not; but this &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at large in Sect. XIV.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is another objection that at fir&s;t view would &s;eem le&s;s ea&s;y to &s;urmount. After the amputation of a foot or a finger, it has frequently happened, that an injury being offered to the &s;tump of the amputated limb, whether from cold air, too great pre&s;&s;ure, or other accidents, the patient has complained of a &s;en&s;ation of pain in the foot or finger, that was cut off. Does not this evince that all our ideas are excited in the brain, and not in the organs of &s;en&s;e? This objec|tion is an&s;wered, by ob&s;erving that our ideas of the &s;hape, place, and &s;olidity of our limbs, are acquired by our organs of touch and of &s;ight, which are &s;ituated in our fingers and eyes, and not by any &s;en&s;ations in the limb it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the pain or &s;en&s;ation, which formerly has ari&s;en in the foot or toes, and been propagated along the nerves to the central part of the &s;en&s;orium, was at the &s;ame time accompanied with a vi&s;ible idea of the &s;hape and place, and with a tangible idea of the &s;olidity of the affected limb: now when the&s;e nerves are afterwards affected by any injury done to the remaining &s;tump with a &s;imilar degree or kind of pain, the ideas of the &s;hape, place, or &s;olidity of the lo&s;t limb, return by a&s;&s;ociation; as the&s;e ideas belong to the organs of &s;ight and touch, on which they were fir&s;t excited.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you wonder what organs of &s;en&s;e can be excited into motion, when you call up the ideas of wi&s;dom or benevolence, which Mr. Locke has termed ab&s;tracted ideas; I a&s;k you by what organs of &s;en&s;e you fir&s;t became acquainted with the&s;e ideas? And the an&s;wer will be reciprocal; for it is certain that all our ideas were originally ac|quired by our organs of &s;en&s;e; for whatever excites our perception mu&s;t be external to the organ that perceives it, and we have no other inlets to knowledge but by our perceptions: as will be further explained in Section XIV. and XV. on the Productions and Cla&s;&s;es of Ideas.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;pirit of animation has four different modes of action, or in other words the animal &s;en&s;orium po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es four different faculties, which are occa&s;ionally exerted, and cau&s;e all the contractions of the fibrous parts of the body. The&s;e are the faculty of cau&s;ing fibrous contractions in con&s;equence of the irritations excited by external bodies, in con&s;equence of the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, in con&s;e|quence of volition, and in con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;ociations of fibrous contractions with other fibrous contractions, which precede or accom|pany them.</P>
<P>The&s;e four faculties of the &s;en&s;orium during their inactive &s;tate are termed irritability, &s;en&s;ibility, voluntarity, and a&s;&s;ociability; in their active &s;tate they are termed as above, irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="2">2. IRRITATION is an exertion or change of &s;ome extreme part of the &s;en&s;orium re&s;iding in the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e, in con&s;e|quence of the appul&s;es of external bodies.</P>

<P>VOLITION is an exertion or change of the central parts of the &s;en|&s;orium, or of the whole of it, <HI>terminating</HI> in &s;ome of tho&s;e extreme parts of it, which re&s;ide in the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>I. ALL the fibrous contractions of animal bodies originate from the &s;en&s;orium, and re&s;olve them&s;elves into four cla&s;&s;es, corre&s;pondent with the four powers or motions of the &s;en&s;orium above de&s;cribed, and from which they have their cau&s;ation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The&s;e fibrous contractions were originally cau&s;ed by the irrita|tions excited by objects, which are external to the moving organ. As the pul&s;ations of the heart are owing to the irritations excited by the &s;timulus of the blood; and the ideas of perception are owing to the irritations excited by external bodies.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations frequently accompanied tho&s;e irritations, by habit the&s;e fibrous contractions became cau&s;eable by the &s;en&s;ations, and the irritations cea&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary to their production. As the &s;ecretion of tears in grief is cau&s;ed by the &s;en&s;a|tion of pain; and the ideas of imagination, as in dreams or delirium, are excited by the plea&s;ure or pain, with which they were formerly accompanied.</P>
<P N="3">3. But as the efforts of the will frequently accompanied the&s;e pain|ful or plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ations, by habit the fibrous contractions became cau&s;able by volition; and both the irritations and &s;en&s;ations cea&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary to their production.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. MANY of our mu&s;cular motions are excited by perpetual ir|ritations, as tho&s;e of the heart and arterial &s;y&s;tem by the circumfluent blood. Many other of them are excited by intermitted irritations, as tho&s;e of the &s;tomach and bowels by the aliment we &s;wallow; of the bile-ducts by the bile; of the kidneys, pancreas, and many other glands, by the peculiar fluids they &s;eparate from the blood; and tho&s;e of the lacteal and other ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els by the chyle, lymph, and moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere. The&s;e motions are accelerated or re|tarded, as their corre&s;pondent irritations are increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, without our attention or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, in the &s;ame manner as the various &s;ecretions of fruit, gum, re&s;in, wax, and honey, are pro|duced in the vegetable world, and as the juices of the earth and the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere are ab&s;orbed by their roots and foliage.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="50">
2. Other mu&s;cular motions, that are mo&s;t frequently connected with our &s;en&s;ations, as tho&s;e of the &s;phincters of the bladder and anus, and the mu&s;culi erectores penis, were originally excited into motion by irritation, for young children make water, and have other evacua|tions without attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances; "et primis etiam ab incunabulis tenduntur &s;aepius puerorum penes, amore nondum ex|pergefacto." So the nipples of young women are liable to become turgid by irritation, long before they are in a &s;ituation to be excited by the plea&s;ure of giving milk to the lips of a child.</P>
<P N="3">3. The contractions of the larger mu&s;cles of our bodies, that are mo&s;t frequently connected with volition, were originally excited into action by internal irritations: as appears from the &s;tretching or yawn|ing of all animals after long &s;leep. In the beginning of &s;ome fevers this irritation of the mu&s;cles produces perpetual &s;tretching and yawn|ing; in other periods of fever an univer&s;al re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s ari&s;es from the &s;ame cau&s;e, the patient changing the attitude of his body every mi|nute. The repeated &s;truggles of the foetus in the uterus mu&s;t be owing to this internal irritation: for the foetus can have no other in|ducement to move its limbs but the toedium or irk&s;omene&s;s of a con|tinued po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e evinces, that the motions of &s;tretching the limbs after a continued attitude are not always owing to the power of the will. Mr. Dean, a ma&s;on, of Au&s;try in Leice&s;ter&s;hire had the &s;pine of the third vertebra of the back enlarged; in &s;ome weeks his lower extremities became feeble, and at length quite paralytic: nei|ther the pain of bli&s;ters, the heat of fomentations, nor the utmo&s;t ef|forts of the will could produce the lea&s;t motion in the&s;e limbs; yet twice or thrice a day for many months his feet, legs, and thighs, were affected for many minutes with forceable &s;tretchings, attended with the &s;en&s;ation of fatigue; and he at length recovered the u&s;e of his limbs, though the &s;pine continued protuberant. The &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance is frequently &s;een in a le&s;s degree in the common hemipla|gia;
<PB N="39" REF="51">
and when this happens, I have believed repeated and &s;trong &s;hocks of electricity to have been of great advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. In like manner the various organs of &s;en&s;e are originally excited into motion by various external &s;timuli adapted to this purpo&s;e, which motions are termed perceptions or ideas; and many of the&s;e motions during our waking hours are excited by perpetual irritation, as tho&s;e of the organs of hearing and of touch. The former by the con&s;tant low indi&s;tinct noi&s;es that murmur around us, and the latter by the weight of our bodies on the parts which &s;upport them; and by the uncea&s;ing variations of the heat, moi&s;ture, and pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;|phere; and the&s;e &s;en&s;ual motions, preci&s;ely as the mu&s;cular ones above mentioned, obey their corre&s;pondent irritations without our at|tention or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Other cla&s;&s;es of our ideas are more frequently excited by our &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, and others by volition: but that the&s;e have all been originally excited by &s;timuli from external objects, and only vary in their combinations or &s;eparations, has been fully evinced by Mr. Locke; and are by him termed the ideas of perception in con|tradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e, which he calls the ideas of reflection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">II. 1. The&s;e mu&s;cular motions, that are excited by perpetual irri|tation, are neverthele&s;s occa&s;ionally excitable by the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, or by volition, as appears by the palpitation of the heart from fear, the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of &s;aliva at the &s;ight of agree|able food, and the glow on the &s;kin of tho&s;e who are a&s;hamed. There is an in&s;tance told in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of a man, who could for a time &s;top the motion of his heart when he plea&s;ed; and Mr. D. has often told me, he could &s;o far increa&s;e the peri&s;taltic mo|tion of his bowels by voluntary efforts, as to produce an evacuation by &s;tool at any time in half an hour.</P>
<P N="2">2. In like manner the &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, that are excited by perpetual irritation, are neverthele&s;s occa&s;ionally excitable by &s;en|&s;ation or volition; as in the night, when we li&s;ten under the influ|ence
<PB N="40" REF="52">
of fear, or from voluntary attention, the motions excited in the organ of hearing by the whi&s;pering of the air in our room, the pul|&s;ation of our own arteries, or the faint beating of a di&s;tant watch, become objects of perception.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>III. Innumerable trains or tribes of other motions are a&s;&s;ociated with the&s;e mu&s;cular motions which are excited by irritation; as by the &s;timulus of the blood in the right chamber of the heart, the lungs are induced to expand them&s;elves; and the pectoral and interco&s;tal mu&s;|cles, and the diaphragm, act at the &s;ame time by their a&s;&s;ociations with them. And when the pharinx is irritated by agreeable food, the mu&s;cles of deglutition are brought into action by a&s;&s;ociation. Thus when a greater light falls on the eye, the iris is brought into action without our attention; and the ciliary proce&s;s, when the focus is formed before or behind the retina, by their a&s;&s;ociations with the in|crea&s;ed irritative motions of the organ of vi&s;ion. Many common ac|tions of life are produced in a &s;imilar manner. If a fly &s;ettle on my forehead, whil&s;t I am intent on my pre&s;ent occupation, I di&s;lodge it with my finger, without exciting my attention or breaking the train of my ideas.</P>
<P N="2">2. In like manner the irritative ideas &s;ugge&s;t to us many other trains or tribes of ideas that are a&s;&s;ociated with them. On this kind of connection, language, letters, hieroglyphics, and ever kind of &s;ym|bol, depend. The &s;ymbols them&s;elves produce irritative ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, which we do not attend to; and other ideas, that are &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation, are excited by their a&s;&s;ociation with them. And as the&s;e irritative ideas make up a part of the chain of our wak|ing thoughts, introducing other ideas that engage our attention, though them&s;elves are unattended to, we find it very difficult to in|ve&s;tigate by what &s;teps many of our hourly trains of ideas gain their admittance.</P>
<P>It may appear paradoxical, that ideas can exi&s;t, and not be attended to; but all our perceptions are ideas excited by irritation, and &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="41" REF="53">
by &s;en&s;ation. Now when the&s;e ideas excited by irritation give us neither plea&s;ure nor pain, we cea&s;e to attend to them. Thus whil&s;t I am walking through that grove before my window, I do not run again&s;t the trees or the benches, though my thoughts are strenuou&s;ly exerted on &s;ome other object. This leads us to a di&s;tinct knowledge of irritative ideas, for the idea of the tree or bench, which I avoid, exi&s;ts on my retina, and induces by a&s;&s;ociation the action of certain locomotive mu&s;cles; though neither it&s;elf nor the actions of tho&s;e mu&s;cles engage my attention.</P>
<P>Thus whil&s;t we are conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject, the tone, note, and articulation of every individual word forms its corre&s;pondent irri|tative idea on the organ of hearing; but we only attend to the a&s;&s;oci|ated ideas, that are attached by habit to the&s;e irritative ones, and are &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation; thus when we read the words "PRINTING|PRESS" we do not attend to the &s;hape, &s;ize, or exi&s;tence of the let|ters which compo&s;e the&s;e words, though each of them excites a cor|re&s;pondent irritative motion of our organ of vi&s;ion, but they intro|duce by a&s;&s;ociation our idea of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of modern inventions; the capacious re&s;ervoir of human knowledge, who&s;e branching &s;treams diffu&s;e &s;ciences, arts, and morality, through all nations and all ages.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. Tho&s;e mu&s;cles of the body that are attached to bones, have in general their principal connections with volition, as I move my pen or rai&s;e my body. The&s;e motions were originally excited by ir|ritation, as was explained in the &s;ection on that &s;ubject, afterwards the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, that accompanied the motions thus excited, induced a repetition of them; and at length many of them

<P>The&s;e ideas of recollection, like the mu&s;cular motions above mentioned, were originally excited by the irritation of external bodies, and were termed ideas of perception: afterwards the plea|&s;ure or pain, that accompanied the&s;e motions, induced a repetition of them in the ab&s;ence of the external body, by which they were fir&s;t excited; and then they were termed ideas of imagination.

By frequent repetitions the&s;e motions acquire a&s;&s;ociations, which continue during our lives, and even after the de&s;truction of the greate&s;t part of the &s;en&s;orium; for the heart of a viper or frog will continue to pul&s;ate long after it is taken from the body; and when it has entirely cea&s;ed to move, if any part of it is goaded with a pin, the whole heart will again re|new its pul&s;ations.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">II. 1. By the various efforts of our &s;en&s;ations to acquire or avoid their objects, many mu&s;cles are daily brought into &s;ucce&s;&s;ive or &s;ynchronous actions; the&s;e become a&s;&s;ociated by habit, and are then excited together with great facility, and in many in&s;tances gain in|di&s;&s;oluble connections. So the play of puppies and kittens is a re|pre&s;entation of their mode of fighting or of taking their prey; and the motions of the mu&s;cles nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e purpo&s;es become a&s;&s;ociated by habit, and gain a great adroitne&s;s of action by the&s;e early repetitions: &s;o the motions of the abdominal mu&s;cles, which were originally brought into concurrent action with the protru&s;ive motion of the rectum or bladder by &s;en&s;ation, become &s;o conjoined with them by habit, that they not only ea&s;ily obey the&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of the excrement and urine, but are brought into violent and unre&s;trainable action in the &s;trangury and tene&s;mus.

that are &s;ometimes indi&s;&s;oluble but with life. Hence the idea of an inhuman or di&s;honourable action perpetually calls up before us the idea of the wretch that was guilty of it.

<P N="1">III. 1. In learning any mechanic art, as mu&s;ic, dancing, or the u&s;e of the &s;word, we teach many of our mu&s;cles to act together or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by repeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into tribes or trains of a&s;&s;ociation, and &s;erve all our pur|po&s;es with great facility, and in &s;ome in&s;tances acquire an indi&s;|&s;oluble union. The&s;e motions are gradually formed into a habit of acting together by a multitude of repetitions, whil&s;t they are yet &s;eparately cau&s;able by the will, as is evident from the long time that is taken up by children in learning to walk and to &s;peak; and is experienced by every one, when he fir&s;t attempts to &s;kate upon the ice or to &s;wim: the&s;e we &s;hall term voluntary a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the&s;e mu&s;cular movements, when they are thus a&s;&s;ociated into tribes or trains, become afterwards not only obedient to volition, but to the &s;en&s;ations and irritations; and the &s;ame movement com|po&s;es a part of many different tribes or trains of motion.

<P>The facility, with which each mu&s;cle changes from one a&s;&s;ociated tribe to another, and that either backwards or forwards, is well ob&s;ervable in the mu&s;cles of the arm in moving the windla&s;s of an

<P N="3">3. In learning every kind of &s;cience we voluntarily a&s;&s;ociate many tribes and trains of ideas, which afterwards are ready for all the purpo&s;es either of volition, &s;en&s;ation, or irritation; and in &s;ome in|&s;tances acquire indi&s;&s;oluble habits of acting together, &s;o as to affect our rea&s;oning, and influence our actions. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of a good education.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ociate ideas are gradually formed into habits of acting together by frequent repetition, while they are yet &s;eparately obe|dient to the will; as is evident from the difficulty we experience in gaining &s;o exact an idea of the front of St. Paul's church, as to be able to delineate it with accuracy, or in recollecting a poem of a few pages.</P>
<P>And the&s;e ideas, thus a&s;&s;ociated into tribes, not only make up the parts of the trains of volition, &s;en&s;ation, and irritation; but the &s;ame idea compo&s;es a part of many different tribes and trains of ideas. So the &s;imple idea of whitene&s;s compo&s;es a part of the com|plex idea of &s;now, milk, ivory; and the complex idea of the letter A compo&s;es a part of the &s;everal a&s;&s;ociated trains of ideas that make up the variety of words, in which this letter enters.</P>
<P>The numerous trains of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociated ideas are divided by Mr. Hume into three cla&s;&s;es, which he has termed contiguity, cau&s;a|tion, and re&s;emblance.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Irritation.</HEAD>
<P>I. THE various organs of &s;en&s;e require various kinds of &s;timula|tion to excite them into action; the particles of light penetrate the cornea and humours of the eye, and then irritate the naked retina; &s;apid particles, di&s;&s;olved or diffu&s;ed in water or &s;aliva, and odorous ones, mixed or combined with the air, irritate the extremities of the nerves of ta&s;te and &s;mell; which either penetrate, or are expanded on the membranes of the tongue and no&s;trils; the auditory nerves are &s;timulated by the vibrations of the atmo&s;phere communicated by means of the tympanum and of the fluid, whether of air or of water, behind it; and the nerves of touch by the hardne&s;s of &s;urrounding bodies, though the cuticle is interpo&s;ed between the&s;e bodies and the medulla of the nerve.</P>
<P>As the nerves of the &s;en&s;es have each their appropriated objects, which &s;timulate them into activity; &s;o the mu&s;cular fibres, which are the terminations of other &s;ets of nerves, have their peculiar ob|jects,
<PB N="55" REF="67">
which excite them into action; the longitudinal mu&s;cles are &s;timulated into contraction by exten&s;ion, whence the &s;tretching or pandiculation after a long continued po&s;ture, during which they have been kept in a &s;tate of exten&s;ion; and the hollow mu&s;cles are excited into action by di&s;tention, as tho&s;e of the rectum and bladder are in|duced to protrude their contents from their &s;en&s;e of the di&s;tention rather than of the acrimony of tho&s;e contents.</P>
<P>There are other objects adapted to &s;timulate the nerves, which terminate in variety of membranes, and tho&s;e e&s;pecially which form the terminations of canals; thus the preparations of mercury particu|larly affect the &s;alivary glands, ipecacuhana affects the &s;phincter of the anus, cantharides that of the bladder, and la&s;tly every gland of the body appears to be indued with a kind of ta&s;te, by which it &s;e|lects or forms each its peculiar fluid from the blood; and by which it is irritated into activity.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e external properties of bodies, which &s;timulate our organs of &s;en&s;e, do not &s;eem to effect this by a &s;ingle impul&s;e, but by repeated impul&s;es; as the nerve of the ear is probably not excit|able by a &s;ingle vibration of air, nor the optic nerve by a &s;ingle par|ticle of light; which circum&s;tance produces &s;ome analogy between tho&s;e two &s;en&s;es, at the &s;ame time the &s;olidity of bodies is perceived by a &s;ingle application of a &s;olid body to the nerves of touch, and that even through the cuticle; and we are probably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a pe|culiar &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h the nice degrees of heat and cold.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;es of touch and of hearing acquaint us with the mechani|cal impact and vibration of bodies, tho&s;e of &s;mell and ta&s;te &s;eem to acquaint us with &s;ome of their chemical properties, while the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion and of heat acquaint us with the exi&s;tence of their peculiar fluids.</P>

<HEAD>Sen&s;ation and Volition.</HEAD>
<P>II. Many motions are produced by plea&s;ure or pain, and that even in contradiction to the power of volition, as in laughing, or in the &s;trangury; but as no name has been given to plea&s;ure or pain, at the time it is exerted &s;o as to cau&s;e fibrous motions, we have u&s;ed the term &s;en&s;ation for this purpo&s;e; and mean it to bear the &s;ame analogy to plea&s;ure and pain, that the word volition does to de&s;ire and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was mentioned in the fifth Section, that what we have termed &s;en&s;ation is a motion of the central parts, or of the whole &s;en&s;orium, <HI>beginning</HI> at &s;ome of the extremities of it. This appears fir&s;t, becau&s;e our pains and plea&s;ures are always cau&s;ed by our ideas or mu&s;cular motions, which are the motions of the extremities of the &s;en&s;orium. And, &s;econdly, becau&s;e the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain frequently continues &s;ome time after the ideas or mu&s;cular motions which excited it have cea&s;ed: for we often feel a glow of plea&s;ure from an agreeable reverie, for many minutes after the ideas, that were the &s;ubject of it, have e&s;caped our memory; and frequently experi|ence a dejection of &s;pirits without being able to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of it but by much recollection.</P>
<P>When the &s;en&s;orial faculty of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion is exerted &s;o as to cau&s;e fibrous motions, it is termed volition; which is &s;aid in Sect. V. to be a motion of the central parts, or of the whole &s;en&s;orium, <HI>terminating</HI> in &s;ome of the extremities of it. This appears, fir&s;t, becau&s;e our de&s;ires and aver&s;ions always terminate in recollecting and comparing our ideas, or in exerting our mu&s;cles; which are the mo|tions of the extremities of the &s;en&s;orium. And, &s;econdly, becau&s;e de&s;ire or aver&s;ion begins, and frequently continues for a time in the central parts of the &s;en&s;orium, before it is peculiarly exerted at the
<PB N="57" REF="69">
extremities of it: for we &s;ometimes feel de&s;ire or aver&s;ion without immediately knowing their objects, and in con&s;equence without im|mediately exerting any of our mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual motions to attain them: as in the beginning of the pa&s;&s;ion of love, and perhaps of hun|ger, or in the ennui of indolent people.</P>
<P>Though &s;en&s;ation and volition begin or terminate at the extremities or central parts of the &s;en&s;orium, yet the whole of it is frequently in|fluenced by the exertion of the&s;e faculties, as appears from their ef|fects on the external habit: for the whole &s;kin is reddened by &s;hame, and an univer&s;al trembling is produced by fear: and every mu&s;cle of the body is agitated in angry people by the de&s;ire of revenge.</P>
<P>There is another very curious circum&s;tance, which &s;hews that &s;en|&s;ation and volition are movements of the &s;en&s;orium in contrary di|rections; that is, that volition begins at the central parts of it, and proceeds to the extremities; and that &s;en&s;ation begins at the extre|mities, and proceeds to the central parts: I mean that the&s;e two &s;en|&s;orial faculties cannot be &s;trongly exerted at the &s;ame time; for when we exert our volition &s;trongly, we do not attend to plea&s;ure or pain; and conver&s;ely, when we are &s;trongly affected with the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain, we u&s;e no volition. As will be further explained in Section XVIII. on &s;leep, and Section XXXIV. on volition.</P>
<P N="2">2. All our emotions and pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to ari&s;e out of the exertions of the&s;e two faculties of the animal &s;en&s;orium. Pride, hope, joy, are the names of particular plea&s;ures: &s;hame, de&s;pair, &s;orrow, are the names of peculiar pains: and love, ambition, avarice, of particular de&s;ires: hatred, di&s;gu&s;t, fear, anxiety, of particular aver&s;ions. Whil&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion of anger includes the pain from a recent injury, and the aver&s;ion to the adver&s;ary that occa&s;ioned it. And compa&s;&s;ion is the pain we experience at the &s;ight of mi&s;ery, and the de&s;ire of re|lieving it.</P>
<P>There is another tribe of de&s;ires, which are commonly termed ap|petites, and are the immediate con&s;equences of the ab&s;ence of &s;ome
<PB N="58" REF="70">
irritative motions. Tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from defect of internal irrita|tions, have proper names conferred upon them, as hunger, thir&s;t, lu&s;t, and the de&s;ire of air, when our re&s;piration is impaired by noxi|ous vapours; and of warmth, when we are expo&s;ed to too great a degree of cold. But tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;timuli are external to the body, are named from the objects, which are by nature con&s;tituted to ex|cite them; the&s;e de&s;ires originate from our pa&s;t experience of the plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations they occa&s;ion, as the &s;mell of an hyacinth, or the ta&s;te of a pine-apple.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that our plea&s;ures and pains are at lea&s;t as vari|ous and as numerous as our irritations; and that our de&s;ires and aver|&s;ions mu&s;t be as numerous as our plea&s;ures and pains. And that as &s;en&s;ation is here u&s;ed as a general term for our numerous plea&s;ures and pains, when they produce the contractions of our fibres; &s;o volition is the general name for our de&s;ires and aver&s;ions, when they produce fibrous contractions. Thus when a motion of the central parts, or of the whole &s;en&s;orium, terminates in the exertion of our mu&s;cles, it is generally called voluntary action; when it terminates in the exertion of our ideas, it is termed recollection, rea&s;oning, determining.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain are originally introduced by the irritations of external objects: &s;o our de&s;ires and aver&s;ions are ori|ginally introduced by tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations; for when the objects of our plea&s;ures or pains are at a di&s;tance, and we cannot in&s;tantaneou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;s the one, or avoid the other, then de&s;ire or aver&s;ion is pro|duced, and a voluntary exertion of our ideas or mu&s;cles &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>The pain of hunger excites you to look out for food, the tree, that &s;hades you, pre&s;ents its odoriferous fruit before your eyes, you ap|proach, pluck, and eat.</P>
<P>The various movements of walking to the tree, gathering the fruit, and ma&s;ticating it, are a&s;&s;ociated motions introduced by their connection with &s;en&s;ation; but if from the uncommon height of the tree, the fruit be inacce&s;&s;ible, and you are prevented from quickly
<PB N="59" REF="71">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the intended plea&s;ure, de&s;ire is produced. The con&s;equence of this de&s;ire is, fir&s;t, a deliberation about the means to gain the ob|ject of plea&s;ure in proce&s;s of time, as it cannot be procured immedi|ately; and, &s;econdly, the mu&s;cular action nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You voluntarily call up all your ideas of cau&s;ation, that are related to the effect you de&s;ire, and voluntarily examine and compare them, and at length determine whether to a&s;cend the tree, or to gather &s;tones from the neighbouring brook, is ea&s;ier to practi&s;e, or more promi&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s; and, finally, you gather the &s;tones, and re|peatedly &s;ling them to di&s;lodge the fruit.</P>
<P>Hence then we gain a criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h voluntary acts or thoughts from tho&s;e cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation. As the former are always employed about the <HI>means</HI> to acquire plea&s;urable objects, or the <HI>means</HI> to avoid painful ones; while the latter are employed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, which are already in our power.</P>
<P>Hence the activity of this power of volition produces the great dif|ference between the human and the brute creation. The ideas and the actions of brutes are almo&s;t perpetually employed about their pre|&s;ent plea&s;ures, or their pre&s;ent pains; and, except in the few in&s;tances which are mentioned in Section XVI. on in&s;tinct, they &s;eldom bu&s;y them&s;elves about the means of procuring future bli&s;s, or of avoiding future mi&s;ery; &s;o that the acquiring of languages, the making of tools, and labouring for money, which are all only the means to pro|cure plea&s;ures; and the praying to the Deity, as another means to procure happine&s;s, are characteri&s;tic of human nature.</P>

As there are many di&s;ea&s;es produced by the quantity of the &s;en|&s;ation of pain or plea&s;ure being too great or too little; &s;o are there di&s;ea&s;es produced by the &s;u&s;ceptibility of the con&s;titution to motions cau&s;able by the&s;e &s;en&s;ations being too dull or too vivid. This &s;u&s;cepti|bility of the &s;y&s;tem to &s;en&s;itive motions is termed &s;en&s;ibility, to di&s;|tingui&s;h it from &s;en&s;ation, which is the actual exi&s;tence or exertion of pain or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="72">
Other cla&s;&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es are owing to the exce&s;&s;ive promptitude, or &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of the con&s;titution to voluntary exertions, as well as to the quantity of de&s;ire or of aver&s;ion.

<P>When a child fir&s;t wrote the word man, it was di&s;tingui&s;hed in his mind into three letters, and tho&s;e letters into many parts of letters; but by repeated u&s;e the word man becomes to his hand in writing it, as to his organs of &s;peech in pronouncing it, but one movement without any deliberation, or &s;en&s;ation, or irritation, interpo&s;ed be|tween the parts of it. And as many &s;eparate motions of our mu&s;cles thus become united, and form, as it were, one motion; &s;o each &s;e|parate motion before &s;uch union may be conceived to con&s;i&s;t of many parts or &s;paces moved through; and perhaps even the individual fibres of our mu&s;cles have thus gradually been brought to act in concert, which habits began to be acquired as early as the very formation of the moving organs, long before the nativity of the animal; as ex|plained in the Section XVI. 2. on in&s;tinct.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are many motions of the body, belonging to the irritative cla&s;s, which might by a ha&s;ty ob&s;erver be mi&s;taken for a&s;&s;ociated ones; as the peri&s;taltic motion of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and the contractions of the heart and arteries; might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a&s;&s;oci|ated

So the di&s;tention or elongation of mu&s;cles by objects external to them irritates them into contraction, though the cuticle or other parts may intervene between the &s;timulating body and the contracting mu&s;cle. Thus a hor&s;e voids his excrement when its weight or bulk irritates the rectum or &s;phincter ani. The motion of the&s;e mu&s;cles act from the irritation of di&s;ten|tion, when he excludes his excrement, but the mu&s;cles of the abdo|men and diaphragm are brought into motion by a&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e of the &s;phincter and rectum.</P>

Spirit of life is not electric ether. Galvani's experiments. 2. Contraction of a fibre. 3. Relaxation &s;ucceeds. 4. Succe&s;&s;ive contractions, with intervals. Quick pul&s;e from debility, from paucity of blood. Weak contractions performed in le&s;s time, and with &s;horter intervals. 5. La&s;t &s;ituation of the fibres continues after contraction. 6. Contraction greater than u&s;ual induces plea&s;ure or pain. 7. Mobility of the fibres uniform. Quantity of &s;en&s;orial power fluctuates. Con&s;titutes excitability. II. <HI>Of &s;en&s;orial exertion.</HI> 1. Animal motion includes &s;timulus, &s;en&s;orial power, and contractile fibres. The &s;en&s;orial faculties act &s;eparately or conjointly. Stimulus of four kinds. Strength and weakne&s;s defined. Sen&s;orial power perpetually exhau&s;ted and renewed. Weakne&s;s from defect of &s;timulus. From defect of &s;en&s;orial power, the direct and indirect debility of Dr. Brown. Why we become warm in Buxton bath after a time, and &s;ee well after a time in a darki&s;h room. Fibres may act violently, or with their whole force, and yet feebly. Great exertion in inflammation explained. Great mu&s;cular force of &s;ome in&s;ane people. 2. Occa&s;ional accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in mu&s;cles &s;ubject to con&s;tant &s;timulus. In animals &s;leeping in winter. In eggs, &s;eeds, &s;chirrous tumours, tendons, bones. 3. Great exertion intro|duces plea&s;ure or pain. Inflammation. Libration of the &s;y&s;tem between torpor and activity. Fever-fits. 4. De&s;ire and aver&s;ion introduced. Exce&s;s of vo|lition cures fevers. III. <HI>Of repeated &s;timulus.</HI> 1. A &s;timulus repeated too frequently lo&s;es effect. As opium, wine, grie&s;. Hence old age. Opium and aloes in &s;mall do&s;es. 2. A &s;timulus not repeated too frequently does not lo&s;e

A &s;timulus repeated frequently and uniformly may be withdrawn, and the action of the organ will continue. Hence the bark cures agues, and &s;trengthens weak con&s;titutions. 5. Defect of &s;timulus repeated at certain intervals cau&s;es fever-fits. 6. Stimulus long applied cea&s;es to act a &s;econd time. 7. If a &s;ti|mulus excites &s;en&s;ation in an organ not u&s;ually excited into &s;en&s;ation, inflam|mation is produced. IV. <HI>Of &s;timulus greater than natural.</HI> 1.

In fibres &s;ubject to perpetual &s;timulus only. Quantity of &s;en&s;orial power in|ver&s;ely as the &s;timulus. 3. Induces pain. As of cold, hunger, head-ach. 4. Induces more feeble and frequent contraction. As in low fevers. Which are frequently owing to deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power rather than to deficiency of &s;timulus. 5. Inverts &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains of motion. Inverts ideas. 6. In|duces paraly&s;is and death. VI. <HI>Cure of increa&s;ed exertion.</HI> 1. Natural cure of exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power. 2. Decrea&s;e the irritations. Vene&s;ection. Cold. Ab&s;tinence. 3. Prevent the previous cold fit. Opium. Bark. Warmth. Anger. Surpri&s;e. 4. Excite &s;ome other part of the &s;y&s;tem. Opium and warm bath relieve pains both from defect and from exce&s;s of &s;ti|mulus. 5. Fir&s;t increa&s;e the &s;timulus above, and then decrea&s;e it beneath the natural quantity.

<P N="1">1. IF two particles of iron lie near each other without motion, and afterwards approach each other; it is rea&s;onable to conclude that &s;omething be&s;ides the iron particles is the cau&s;e of their approxima|tion; this invi&s;ible &s;omething is termed magneti&s;m. In the &s;ame manner, if the particles, which compo&s;e an animal mu&s;cle, do not touch each other in the relaxed &s;tate of the mu&s;cle, and are brought into contact during the contraction of the mu&s;cle; it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that &s;ome other agent is the cau&s;e of this new approxima|tion. For nothing can act, where it does not exi&s;t; for to act in|cludes to exi&s;t; and therefore the particles of the mu&s;cular fibre (which in its &s;tate of relaxation are &s;uppo&s;ed not to touch) cannot af|fect each other without the influence of &s;ome intermediate agent; this agent is here termed the &s;pirit of animation, or &s;en&s;orial power, but may with equal propriety be termed the power, which cau&s;es contraction; or may be called by any other name, which the reader may choo&s;e to affix to it.</P>
<P>The contraction of a mu&s;cular fibre may be compared to the follow|ing electric experiment, which is here mentioned not as a philo&s;ophi|cal analogy, but as an illu&s;tration or &s;imile to facilitate the conception of a difficult &s;ubject. Let twenty very &s;mall Leyden phials properly
<PB N="65" REF="79">
coated be hung in a row by fine &s;ilk threads at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other; let the internal charge of one phial be po&s;itive, and of the other negative alternately, if a communication be made from the in|ternal &s;urface of the fir&s;t to the external &s;urface of the la&s;t in the row, they will all of them in&s;tantly approach each other, and thus &s;horten a line that might connect them like a mu&s;cular fibre. See Botanic Garden, p. 1. Canto I. l. 202, note on Gymnotus.</P>
<P>The attractions of electricity or of magneti&s;m do not apply philo|&s;ophically to the illu&s;tration of the contraction of animal fibres, &s;ince the force of tho&s;e attractions increa&s;es in &s;ome proportion inver&s;ely as the di&s;tance, but in mu&s;cular motion there appears no difference in velocity or &s;trength during the beginning or end of the contraction, but what may be clearly a&s;cribed to the varying mechanic advantage in the approximation of one bone to another. Nor can mu&s;cular mo|tion be a&s;&s;imilated with greater plau&s;ibility to the attraction of cohe&s;ion or ela&s;ticity; for in bending a &s;teel &s;pring, as a &s;mall &s;word, a le&s;s force is required to bend it the fir&s;t inch than the &s;econd; and the &s;econd than the third; the particles of &s;teel on the convex &s;ide of the bent &s;pring endeavouring to re&s;tore them&s;elves more powerfully the further they are drawn from each other. See Botanic Garden, P. 1. addit. Note XVIII.</P>
<P>I am aware that this may be explained another way, by &s;uppo&s;ing the ela&s;ticity of the &s;pring to depend more on the compre&s;&s;ion of the particles on the concave &s;ide than on the exten&s;ion of them on the con|vex &s;ide; and by &s;uppo&s;ing the ela&s;ticity of the ela&s;tic gum to depend more on the re&s;i&s;tance to the lateral compre&s;&s;ion of its particles than to the longitudinal exten&s;ion of them. Neverthele&s;s in mu&s;cular contraction, as above ob&s;erved, there appears no difference in the ve|locity or force of it at its commencement or at its termination; from whence we mu&s;t conclude that animal contraction is governed by laws of its own, and not by tho&s;e of mechanics, chemi&s;try, magne|ti&s;m, or electricity.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80">
On the&s;e accounts I do not think the experiments conclu&s;ive, which were lately publi&s;hed by Galvani, Volta, and others, to &s;hew a &s;imilitude between the &s;pirit of animation, which contracts the mu&s;cular fibres, and the electric fluid. Since the electric fluid may act only as a more potent &s;timulus exciting the mu&s;cular fibres into action, and not by &s;upplying them with a new quantity of the &s;pirit of life. Thus in a recent hemiplegia I have frequently ob&s;erved, when the patient yawned and &s;tretched him&s;elf, that the paralytic limbs moved al&s;o, though they were totally di&s;obedient to the will. And when he was electri&s;ied by pa&s;&s;ing &s;hocks from the affected hand to the affected foot, a motion of the paralytic limbs was al&s;o produced. Now as in the act of yawning the mu&s;cles of the paralytic limbs were excited into action by the &s;timulus of the irk&s;omene&s;s of a continued po&s;ture, and not by any additional quantity of the &s;pirit of life; &s;o we may conclude, that the pa&s;&s;age of the electric fluid, which pro|duced a &s;imilar effect, acted only as a &s;timulus, and not by &s;upplying any addition of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P>If neverthele&s;s this theory &s;hould ever become e&s;tabli&s;hed, a &s;timu|lus mu&s;t be called an eductor of vital ether; which &s;timulus may con&s;i&s;t of &s;en&s;ation or volition, as in the electric eel, as well as in the appul&s;es of external bodies; and by drawing off the charges of vital fluid may occa&s;ion the contraction or motions of the mu&s;cular &s;ibres, and organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The immediate effect of the action of the &s;pirit of animation or &s;en&s;orial power on the fibrous parts of the body, whether it acts in the mode of irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation, is a con|traction of the animal fibre, according to the &s;econd law of animal cau&s;ation. Sect. IV. Thus the &s;timulus of the blood induces the contraction of the heart; the agreeable ta&s;te of a &s;trawberry produces the contraction of the mu&s;cles of deglutition; the effort of the will contracts the mu&s;cles, which move the limbs in walking; and by a&s;&s;ociation other mu&s;cles of the trunk are brought into contraction to
<PB N="67" REF="81">
pre&s;erve the balance of the body. The fibrous extremities of the or|gans of &s;en&s;e have been &s;hewn, by the ocular &s;pectra in Sect. III. to &s;uffer &s;imilar contraction by each of the above modes of excitation; and by their configurations to con&s;titute our ideas.</P>
<P N="3">3. After animal fibres have for &s;ome time been excited into contrac|tion, a relaxation &s;ucceeds, even though the exciting cau&s;e continues to act. In re&s;pect to the irritative motions this is exemplified in the peri&s;taltic contractions of the bowels; which cea&s;e and are renewed alternately, though the &s;timulus of the aliment continues to be uni|formly applied; in the &s;en&s;itive motions, as in &s;trangury, tene&s;mus, and parturition, the alternate contractions and relaxations of the mu&s;|cles exi&s;t, though the &s;timulus is perpetual. In our voluntary ex|ertions it is experienced, as no one can hang long by the hands, how|ever vehemently he wills &s;o to do; and in the a&s;&s;ociate motions the con&s;tant change of our attitudes evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of relaxation to tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which have been long in action.</P>
<P>This relaxation of a mu&s;cle after its contraction, even though the &s;timulus continues to be applied, appears to ari&s;e from the expenditure or diminution of the &s;pirit of animation previou&s;ly re&s;ident in the mu&s;|cle, according to the &s;econd law of animal cau&s;ation in Sect. IV. In tho&s;e con&s;titutions, which are termed weak, the &s;pirit of anima|tion becomes &s;ooner exhau&s;ted, and tremulous motions are produced, as in the hands of infirm people, when they lift a cup to their mouths. This quicker exhau&s;tion of the &s;pirit of animation is probably owing to a le&s;s quantity of it re&s;iding in the acting fibres, which therefore more frequently require a &s;upply from the nerves, which belong to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the &s;en&s;orial power continues to act, whether it acts in the mode of irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation, a new con|traction of the animal fibre &s;ucceeds after a certain interval; which interval is of &s;horter continuance in weak people than in &s;trong ones. This is exemplified in the &s;haking of the hands of weak people, when
<PB N="68" REF="82">
they attempt to write. In a manu&s;cript epi&s;tle of one of my cor|re&s;pondents, which is written in a &s;mall hand, I ob&s;erved from four to &s;ix zigzags in the perpendicular &s;troke of every letter, which &s;hews that both the contractions of the fingers, and intervals be|tween them, mu&s;t have been performed in very &s;hort periods of time.</P>
<P>The times of contraction of the mu&s;cles of enfeebled people being le&s;s, and the intervals between tho&s;e contractions being le&s;s al&s;o, ac|counts for the quick pul&s;e in fevers with debility, and in dying ani|mals. The &s;hortne&s;s of the intervals between one contraction and another in weak con&s;titutions, is probably owing to the general defi|ciency of the quantity of the &s;pirit of animation, and that therefore there is a le&s;s quantity of it to be received at each interval of the ac|tivity of the fibres. Hence in repeated motions, as of the fingers in performing on the harp&s;ichord, it would at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, that &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;trength were incompatible; neverthele&s;s the &s;ingle contraction of a mu&s;cle is performed with greater velocity as well as with greater force by vigorous con&s;titutions, as in throwing a javelin.</P>
<P>There is however another circum&s;tance, which may often contri|bute to cau&s;e the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e in nervous fevers, as in ani|mals bleeding to death in the &s;laughter-hou&s;e; which is the deficient quantity of blood; whence the heart is but half di&s;tended, and in con|&s;equence &s;ooner contracts. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 1.</P>
<P>For we mu&s;t not confound frequency of repetition with quickne&s;s of motion, or the number of pul&s;ations with the velocity, with which the fibres, which con&s;titute the coats of the arteries, contract them|&s;elves. For where the frequency of the pul&s;ations is but &s;eventy-five in a minute, as in health; the contracting fibres, which con&s;titute the &s;ides of the arteries, may move through a greater &s;pace in a given time, than where the frequency of pul&s;ation is one hundred and fifty in a minute, as in &s;ome fevers with great debility. For if in tho&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="83">
fevers the arteries do not expand them&s;elves in their dia&s;tole to more than half the u&s;ual diameter of their dia&s;tole in health, the fibres which con&s;titute their coats, will move through a le&s;s &s;pace in a mi|nute than in health, though they make two pul&s;ations for one.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the diameter of the artery during its &s;y&s;tole to be one line, and that the diameter of the &s;ame artery during its dia&s;tole is in health is four lines, and in a fever with great debility only two lines. It fol|lows, that the arterial fibres contract in health from a circle of twelve lines in circumference to a circle of three lines in circumference, that is they move through a &s;pace of nine lines in length. While the ar|terial fibres in the fever with debility would twice contract from a circle of &s;ix lines to a circle of three lines; that is while they move through a &s;pace equal to &s;ix lines. Hence though the frequency of pul&s;ation in fever be greater as two to one, yet the velocity of con|traction in health is greater as nine to &s;ix, or as three to two.</P>
<P>On the contrary in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es with &s;trength, as in the pleuri&s;y, the velocity of the contracting &s;ides of the arteries is much greater than in health, for if we &s;uppo&s;e the number of pul&s;ations in a pleuri&s;y to be half as much more than in health, that is as one hun|dred and twenty to eighty, (which is about what generally happens in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es) and if the diameter of the artery in dia&s;tole be one third greater than in health, which I believe is near the truth, the re&s;ult will be, that the velocity of the contractile &s;ides of the ar|teries will be in a pleuri&s;y as two and a half to one, compared to the velocity of their contraction in a &s;tate of health, for if the circum|ference of the &s;y&s;tole of the artery be three lines, and the dia&s;tole in health be twelve lines in circumference, and in a pleuri&s;y eighteen lines; and &s;econdly, if the artery pul&s;ates thrice in the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate for twice in the healthy one, it follows, that the velocity of contrac|tion in the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate to that in the healthy &s;tate will be forty-five to eighteen, or as two and a half to one.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="84">
From hence it would appear, that if we had a criterion to deter|mine the velocity of the arterial contractions, it would at the &s;ame time give us their &s;trength, and thus be of more &s;ervice in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing di&s;ea&s;es, than the knowledge of their frequency. As &s;uch a cri|terion cannot be had, the frequency of pul&s;ation, the age of the pa|tient being allowed for, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;&s;i&s;t us to di&s;tingui&s;h arterial &s;trength from arterial debility, &s;ince in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es with &s;trength the frequency &s;eldom exceeds one hundred and eighteen or one hundred and twenty pul&s;ations in a minute; unle&s;s under pe|culiar circum&s;tance, as the great additional &s;timuli of wine or of ex|ternal heat.</P>
<P N="5">5. After a mu&s;cle or organ of &s;en&s;e has been excited into contrac|tion, and the &s;en&s;orial power cea&s;es to act, the la&s;t &s;ituation or con|figuration of it continues; unle&s;s it be di&s;turbed by the action of &s;ome antagoni&s;t fibres, or other extraneous power. Thus in weak or lan|guid people, wherever they throw their limbs on their bed or &s;ofa, there they lie, till another exertion changes their attitude; hence one kind of ocular &s;pectra &s;eems to be produced after looking at bright objects; thus when a fire-&s;tick is whirled round in the night, there appears in the eye a complete circle of fire; the action or configuration of one part of the retina not cea&s;ing before the return of the whirling fire.</P>
<P>Thus if any one looks at the &s;etting &s;un for a &s;hort time, and then covers his clo&s;ed eyes with his hand, he will for many &s;econds of time perceive the image of the &s;un on his retina. A &s;imilar image of all other bodies would remain &s;ome time in the eye, but is effaced by the eternal change of the motions of the extremity of this nerve in our attention to other objects. See Sect. XVII. 1. 3. on Sleep. Hence the dark &s;pots, and other ocular &s;pectra, are more frequently attended to, and remain longer in the eyes of weak people, as after violent ex|erci&s;e, intoxication, or want of &s;leep.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="71" REF="85">
6. A contraction of the fibres &s;omewhat greater than u&s;ual intro|duces plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation into the &s;y&s;tem, according to the fourth law of animal cau&s;ation. Hence the plea&s;ure in the beginning of drunkenne&s;s is owing to the increa&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem from the &s;timulus of vinous &s;pirit or of opium.

<P>If any part of the &s;y&s;tem, which is u&s;ed to perpetual activity, as the &s;tomach, or heart, or the fine ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, acts for a time with le&s;s energy, another kind of painful &s;en&s;ation en&s;ues, which is called hunger, or faintne&s;s, or cold. This occurs in a le&s;s degree in the locomotive mu&s;cles, and is called weary&s;omene&s;s. In the two former kinds of &s;en&s;ation there is an expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power, in the&s;e latter there is an accumulation of it.</P>
<P N="7">7. We have u&s;ed the words exertion of &s;en&s;orial power as a general term to expre&s;s either irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation; that is, to expre&s;s the activity or motion of the &s;pirit of animation, at the time it produces the contractions of the fibrous parts of the &s;y&s;tem. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that there may exi&s;t a greater or le&s;s mobility of the fibrous parts of our &s;y&s;tem, or a propen&s;ity to be &s;timulated into contraction by the greater or le&s;s quantity or energy of the &s;pirit of animation; and that hence if the exertion of the &s;en&s;orial power be in its natural &s;tate, and the mobility of the fibres be increa&s;ed, the &s;ame quantity of fibrous contraction will be cau&s;ed, as if the mobility of the fibres continues in its natural &s;tate, and the &s;en&s;orial exertion be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus it may be conceived, that in di&s;ea&s;es accompanied with &s;trength, as in inflammatory fevers with arterial &s;trength, that the cau&s;e of greater fibrous contraction may exi&s;t in the increa&s;ed mobi|lity of the &s;ibres, who&s;e contractions are thence both more forceable and more frequent. And that in di&s;ea&s;es attended with debility, as in nervous fevers, where the fibrous contractions are weaker, and
<PB N="72" REF="86">
more frequent, it may be conceived that the cau&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in a de|crea&s;e of mobility of the fibres; and that tho&s;e weak con&s;titutions, which are attended with cold extremities and large pupils of the eyes, may po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s mobility of the contractile fibres, as well as le&s;s quan|tity of exertion of the &s;pirit of animation.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this mode of rea&s;oning it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the contractile fibres con&s;i&s;t of inert matter, and when the &s;en|&s;orial power is withdrawn, as in death, they po&s;&s;e&s;s no power of mo|tion at all, but remain in their la&s;t &s;tate, whether of contraction or relaxation, and mu&s;t thence derive the whole of this property from the &s;pirit of animation. At the &s;ame time it is not improbable, that the moving fibres of &s;trong people may po&s;&s;e&s;s a capability of receiving or containing a greater quantity of the &s;pirit of animation than tho&s;e of weak people.</P>
<P>In every contraction of a fibre there is an expenditure of the &s;en&s;o|rial power, or &s;pirit of animation; and where the exertion of this &s;en&s;orial power has been for &s;ome time increa&s;ed, and the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e have in con&s;equence acted with greater energy, its propen&s;ity to activity is proportionally le&s;&s;ened; which is to be a&s;crib|ed to the exhau&s;tion or diminution of its quantity. On the contrary, where there has been le&s;s fibrous contraction than u&s;ual for a certain time, the &s;en&s;orial power or &s;pirit of animation becomes accumulated in the inactive part of the &s;y&s;tem. Hence vigour &s;ucceeds re&s;t, and hence the propen&s;ity to action of all our organs of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cles is in a &s;tate of perpetual fluctuation. The irritability for in&s;tance of the retina, that is, its quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, varies every mo|ment according to the brightne&s;s or ob&s;curity of the object la&s;t beheld compared with the pre&s;ent one. The &s;ame occurs to our &s;en&s;e of heat, and to every part of our &s;y&s;tem, which is capable of being ex|cited into action.</P>
<P>When this variation of the exertion of the &s;en&s;orial power becomes much and permanently above or beneath the natural quantity, it be|comes
<PB N="73" REF="87">
a di&s;ea&s;e. If the irritative motions be too great or too little, it &s;hews that the &s;timulus of external things affect this &s;en&s;orial power too violently or too inertly. If the &s;en&s;itive motions be too great or too little, the cau&s;e ari&s;es from the deficient or exuberant quantity of &s;en&s;ation produced in con&s;equence of the motions of the mu&s;cular fibres or organs of &s;en&s;e; if the voluntary actions are di&s;ea&s;ed the cau&s;e is to be looked for in the quantity of volition produced in con|&s;equence of the de&s;ire or aver&s;ion occa&s;ioned by the painful or plea|&s;urable &s;en&s;ations above mentioned. And the di&s;ea&s;es of a&s;&s;ociations probably depend on the greater or le&s;s quantity of the other three &s;en|&s;orial powers by which they were formed.</P>
<P>From whence it appears that the propen&s;ity to action, whether it be called irritability, &s;en&s;ibility, voluntarity, or a&s;&s;ociability, is only another mode of expre&s;&s;ion for the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power re&s;iding in the organ to be excited. And that on the contrary the words in|irritability and in&s;en&s;ibility, together with inaptitude to voluntary and a&s;&s;ociate motions, are &s;ynonymous with deficiency of the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, or of the &s;pirit of animation, re&s;iding in the organs to be excited.</P>

<HEAD>II. Of &s;en&s;orial Exertion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. There are three circum&s;tances to be attended to in the produc|tion of animal motions. 1&s;t. The &s;timulus. 2d. The &s;en&s;orial power. 3d. The contractile fibre. 1&s;t. A &s;timulus, external to the organ, originally induces into action the &s;en&s;orial faculty termed irritation; this produces the contraction of the fibres, which, if it be perceived at all, introduces plea&s;ure or pain; which in their active &s;tate are termed &s;en&s;ation; which is another &s;en&s;orial faculty, and occa&s;ionally pro|duces contraction of the fibres; this plea&s;ure or pain is therefore to be con&s;idered as another &s;timulus, which may either act alone or in con|junction with the former faculty of the &s;en&s;orium termed irritation.
<PB N="74" REF="88">
This new &s;timulus of plea&s;ure or pain either induces into action the &s;en&s;orial faculty termed &s;en&s;ation, which then produces the contrac|tion of the fibres; or it introduces de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, which excite into action another &s;en&s;orial faculty, termed volition, and may there|fore be con&s;idered as another &s;timulus, which either alone or in con|junction with one or both of the two former faculties of the &s;en&s;orium produces the contraction of animal fibres. There is another &s;en&s;orial power, that of a&s;&s;ociation, which perpetually, in conjunction with one or more of the above, and frequently &s;ingly, produces the con|traction of animal fibres, and which is it&s;elf excited into action by the previous motions of contracting fibres.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;en&s;orial power, termed irritation, re&s;iding in any par|ticular fibres, is excited into exertion by the &s;timulus of external bodies acting on tho&s;e fibres; the &s;en&s;orial power, termed &s;en&s;ation, re&s;iding in any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the &s;timulus of plea&s;ure or pain acting on tho&s;e fibres; the &s;en&s;orial power, termed volition, re&s;iding in any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the &s;timulus of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion; and the &s;en&s;orial power, termed a&s;&s;ociation, re&s;iding in any particular fibres, is excited into action by the &s;timulus of other fibrous motions, which had frequently preceded them. The word &s;timulus may therefore be u&s;ed without impro|priety of language, for any of the&s;e four cau&s;es, which excite the four &s;en&s;orial powers into exertion. For though the immediate cau&s;e of volition has generally been termed <HI>a motive</HI>; and that of irritation only has generally obtained the name of <HI>&s;timulus</HI>; yet as the imme|diate cau&s;e, which excites the &s;en&s;orial powers of &s;en&s;ation, or of a&s;|&s;ociation into exertion, have obtained no general name, we &s;hall u&s;e the word &s;timulus for them all.</P>
<P>Hence the quantity of motion produced in any particular part of the animal &s;y&s;tem will be as the quantity of &s;timulus and the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, or &s;pirit of animation, re&s;iding in the contracting fibres. Where both the&s;e quantities are great, <HI>&s;trength</HI> is produced,
<PB N="75" REF="89">
when that word is applied to the motions of animal bodies. Where either of them is deficient, <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> is produced, as applied to the motions of animal bodies.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;en&s;orial power, or &s;pirit of animation, is perpetually exhau&s;ted by the expenditure of it in fibrous contractions, and is per|petually renewed by the &s;ecretion or production of it in the brain and &s;pinal marrow, the quantity of animal &s;trength mu&s;t be in a perpetual &s;tate of fluctuation on this account; and if to this be added the un|cea&s;ing variation of all the four kinds of &s;timulus above de&s;cribed, which produce the exertions of the &s;en&s;orial powers, the cea&s;ele&s;s vi|ci&s;&s;itude of animal &s;trength becomes ea&s;ily comprehended.</P>
<P>If the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power remains the &s;ame, and the quan|tity of &s;timulus be le&s;&s;ened, a weakne&s;s of the fibrous contractions en&s;ues, which may be denominated <HI>debility from defect of &s;timulus.</HI> If the quantity of &s;timulus remains the &s;ame, and the quantity of &s;en|&s;orial power be le&s;&s;ened, another kind of weakne&s;s en&s;ues, which may be termed <HI>debility from defect of &s;en&s;orial power</HI>; the former of the&s;e is called by Dr. Brown, in his Elements of Medicine, direct debility, and the latter indirect debility. The coincidence of &s;ome parts of this work with corre&s;pondent deductions in the Brunonian Elementa Medicina, a work (with &s;ome exceptions) of great genius, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as confirmations of the truth of the theory, as they were probably arrived at by different trains of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Thus in tho&s;e who have been expo&s;ed to cold and hunger there is a deficiency of &s;timulus. While in nervous fever there is a deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power. And in habitual drunkards, in a morning before their u&s;ual potation, there is a deficiency both of &s;timulus and of &s;en|&s;orial power. While, on the other hand, in the beginning of intoxica|tion there is an exce&s;s of &s;timulus; in the hot-ach, after the hands have been immer&s;ed in &s;now, there is a redundancy of &s;en&s;orial power; and in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es with arterial &s;trength, there is an exce&s;s of both.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="90">
Hence if the &s;en&s;orial power be le&s;&s;ened, while the quantity of &s;ti|mulus remains the &s;ame as in nervous fever, the frequency of repetition of the arterial contractions may continue, but their force in re&s;pect to removing ob&s;tacles, as in promoting the circulation of the blood, or the velocity of each contraction, will be dimini&s;hed, that is, the animal &s;trength will be le&s;&s;ened. And &s;econdly, if the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power be le&s;&s;ened, and the &s;timulus be increa&s;ed to a certain degree, as in giving opium in nervous fevers, the arterial contractions may be performed more frequently than natural, yet with le&s;s &s;trength.</P>
<P>And thirdly, if the &s;en&s;orial power continues the &s;ame in re&s;pect to quantity, and the &s;timulus be &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed, as in going into a darki&s;h room, or into a coldi&s;h bath, &s;uppo&s;e of about eighty degrees of heat, as Buxton-bath, a temporary weakne&s;s of the affected fibres is induced, till an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power gradually &s;ucceeds, and counterbalances the deficiency of &s;timulus, and then the bath cea&s;es to feel cold, and the room cea&s;es to appear dark; becau&s;e the fibres of the &s;ubcutaneous ve&s;&s;els, or of the organs of &s;en&s;e, act with their u&s;ual energy.</P>
<P>A &s;et of mu&s;cular fibres may thus be &s;timulated into violent ex|ertion, that is, they may act frequently, and with their whole &s;en|&s;orial power, but may neverthele&s;s not act &s;trongly; becau&s;e the quantity of their &s;en&s;orial power was originally &s;mall, or was previ|ou&s;ly exhau&s;ted. Hence a &s;timulus may be great, and the irritation in con&s;equence act with its full force, as in the hot paroxi&s;ms of nervous fever; but if the &s;en&s;orial power, termed irritation, be &s;mall in quantity, the force of the fibrous contractions, and the times of their continuance in their contracted &s;tate, will be proportionally &s;mall.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner in the hot paroxi&s;m of putrid fevers, which are &s;hewn in Sect. XXXIII. to be inflammatory fevers with arterial debility, the &s;en&s;orial power termed &s;en&s;ation is exerted with great activity, yet the fibrous contractions, which produce the circulation
<PB N="77" REF="91">
of the blood, are performed without &s;trength, becau&s;e the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power then re&s;iding in that part of the &s;y&s;tem is &s;mall.</P>
<P>Thus in irritative fever with arterial &s;trength, that is, with ex|ce&s;s of &s;pirit of animation, the quantity of exertion during the hot part of the paroxi&s;m is to be e&s;timated from the quantity of &s;timulus, and the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power. While in &s;en&s;itive (or inflam|matory) fever with arterial &s;trength, that is, with exce&s;s of &s;pirit of animation, the violent and forcible actions of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem during the hot part of the paroxi&s;m are induced by the exertions of two &s;en&s;orial powers, which are excited by two kinds of &s;timulus. The&s;e are the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation excited by the &s;timulus of bodies external to the moving fibres, and the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en|&s;ation excited by the pain in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed contractions of tho&s;e moving fibres.</P>
<P>And in in&s;ane people in &s;ome ca&s;es the force of their mu&s;cular ac|tions will be in proportion to the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the quantity of the &s;timulus of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, which excites their volition into action. At the &s;ame time in other ca&s;es the &s;timulus of pain or plea&s;ure, and the &s;timulus of external bodies, may excite into action the &s;en&s;orial powers of &s;en&s;ation and irritation, and thus add greater force to their mu&s;cular actions.</P>
<P N="2">2. The application of the &s;timulus, whether that &s;timulus be &s;ome quality of external bodies, or plea&s;ure or pain, or de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, or a link of a&s;&s;ociation, excites the corre&s;pondent &s;en&s;orial power into action, and this cau&s;es the contraction of the fibre. On the contrac|tion of the fibre a part of the &s;pirit of animation becomes expended, and the fibre cea&s;es to contract, though the &s;timulus continues to be applied; till in a certain time the fibre having received a &s;upply of &s;en&s;orial power is ready to contract again, if the &s;timulus continues to be applied. If the &s;timulus on the contrary be withdrawn, the &s;ame quantity of quie&s;cent &s;en&s;orial power becomes re&s;ident in the fibre as before its contraction; as appears from the readine&s;s for ac|tion
<PB N="78" REF="92">
of the large locomotive mu&s;cles of the body in a &s;hort time after common exertion.</P>
<P>But in tho&s;e mu&s;cular fibres, which are &s;ubject to con&s;tant &s;timu|lus, as the arteries, glands, and capillary ve&s;&s;els, another phenomenon occurs, if their accu&s;tomed &s;timulus be withdrawn; which is, that the &s;en&s;orial power becomes accumulated in the contractile fibres, owing to the want of its being perpetually expended, or carried away, by their u&s;ual unremitted contractions. And on this account tho&s;e mu&s;cular fibres become afterwards excitable into their natural actions by a much weaker &s;timulus; or into unnatural violence of action by their accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, as is &s;een in the hot fits of intermittent fevers, which are in con&s;equence of the previous cold ones. Thus the minute ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin are con&s;tantly &s;timulated by the fluid matter of heat; if the quantity of this &s;timulus of heat be a while dimini&s;hed, as in covering the hands with &s;now, the ve&s;&s;els cea&s;e to act, as appears from the palene&s;s of the &s;kin; if this cold application of &s;now be continued but a &s;hort time, the &s;en&s;orial power, which had habitually been &s;upplied to the fibres, becomes now accumulated in them, owing to the want of its being expended by their accu&s;tomed contractions. And thence a le&s;s &s;timulus of heat will now excite them into violent contractions.</P>
<P>If the quie&s;cence of fibres, which had previou&s;ly been &s;ubject to perpetual &s;timulus, continues a longer time; or their accu&s;tomed &s;timulus be more completely withdrawn; the accumulation of &s;en&s;o|rial power becomes &s;till greater, as in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to cold and hun|ger; pain is produced, and the organ gradually dies from the chemical changes, which take place in it; or it is at a great di&s;tance of time re&s;tored to action by &s;timulus applied with great caution in &s;mall quantity, as happens to &s;ome larger animals and to many in&s;ects, which during the winter months lie benumbed with cold, and are &s;aid to &s;leep, and to per&s;ons apparently drowned, or apparently frozen to death. Snails have been &s;aid to revive by throwing them
<PB N="79" REF="93">
into water after having been many years &s;hut up in the cabinets of the curious; and eggs and &s;eeds in general are re&s;tored to life after many months of torpor by the &s;timulus of warmth and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The inflammation of &s;chirrous tumours, which have long exi&s;ted in a &s;tate of inaction, is a proce&s;s of this kind; as well as the &s;en&s;ibi|lity acquired by inflamed tendons and bones, which had at their formation a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ibility, which had &s;o long lain dormant in their uninflamed &s;tate.</P>
<P N="3">3. If after long quie&s;cence from defect of &s;timulus the fibres, which had previou&s;ly been habituated to perpetual &s;timulus, are again expo&s;ed to but their u&s;ual quantity of it; as in tho&s;e who have &s;uf|fered the extremes of cold or hunger; a violent exertion of the af|fected organ commences, owing, as above explained, to the great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power. This violent exertion not only di|mini&s;hes the accumulated &s;pirit of animation, but at the &s;ame time induces plea&s;ure or pain into the &s;y&s;tem, which, whether it be &s;uc|ceeded by inflammation or not, becomes an additional &s;timulus, and acting along with the former one, produces &s;till greater exertions; and thus reduces the &s;en&s;orial power in the contracting fibres beneath its natural quantity.</P>
<P>When the &s;pirit of animation is thus exhau&s;ted by u&s;ele&s;s exer|tions, the organ becomes torpid or unexcitable into action, and a &s;econd fit of quie&s;cence &s;ucceeds that of abundant activity. During this &s;econd fit of quie&s;cence the &s;en&s;orial power becomes again accu|mulated, and another fit of exertion follows in train. The&s;e vici&s;&s;i|tudes of exertion and inertion of the arterial &s;y&s;tem con&s;titute the paroxi&s;ms of remittent fevers; or intermittent ones, when there is an interval of the natural action of the arteries between the exacerba|tions.</P>
<P>In the&s;e paroxi&s;ms of fevers, which con&s;i&s;t of the libration of the arterial &s;y&s;tem between the extremes of exertion and quie&s;cence, either the fits become le&s;s and le&s;s violent from the contractile fibres be|coming
<PB N="80" REF="94">
le&s;s excitable to the &s;timulus by habit, that is, by becoming accu&s;tomed to it, as explained below XII. 3. 1. or the whole &s;en&s;o|rial power becomes exhau&s;ted, and the arteries cea&s;e to beat, and the patient dies in the cold part of the paroxi&s;m. Or &s;econdly, &s;o much pain is introduced into the &s;y&s;tem by the violent contractions of the fibres, that inflammation ari&s;es, which prevents future cold fits by expending a part of the &s;en&s;orial power in the exten&s;ion of old ve&s;&s;els or the production of new ones; and thus preventing the too great ac|cumulation or exertion of it in other parts of the &s;y&s;tem; or which by the great increa&s;e of &s;timulus excites into great action the whole glandular &s;y&s;tem as well as the arterial, and thence a greater quantity of &s;en&s;orial power is produced in the brain, and thus its exhau&s;tion in any peculiar part of the &s;y&s;tem cea&s;es to be affected.</P>
<P N="4">4. Or thirdly, in con&s;equence of the painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tion above mentioned, de&s;ire and aver&s;ion are introduced, and inordinate volition &s;ucceeds; which by its own exertions expends &s;o much of the &s;pirit of animation, that the two other &s;en&s;orial faculties, or irritation and &s;en&s;ation, act &s;o much feebler; that the paroxi&s;ms of fever, or that libration between the extremes of exertion and inactivity of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, gradually &s;ub&s;ides. On this account a temporary in|&s;anity is a favourable &s;ign in fevers, as I have had &s;ome opportunities of ob&s;erving.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>III. Of repeated Stimulus.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When a &s;timulus is repeated more frequently than the expendi|ture of &s;en&s;orial power can be renewed in the acting organ, the effect of the &s;timulus becomes gradually dimini&s;hed. Thus if two grains of opium be &s;wallowed by a per&s;on unu&s;ed to &s;o &s;trong a &s;timulus, all the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems in the body act with greater energy, all the &s;e|cretions and the ab&s;orption from tho&s;e &s;ecreted fluids are increa&s;ed in
<PB N="81" REF="95">
quantity; and plea&s;ure or pain are introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, which adds an additional &s;timulus to that already too great. After &s;ome hours the &s;en&s;orial power becomes dimini&s;hed in quantity, expended by the great activity of the &s;y&s;tem; and thence, when the &s;timulus of the opium is withdrawn, the fibres will not obey their u&s;ual de|gree of natural &s;timulus, and a con&s;equent torpor or quie&s;cence &s;uc|ceeds, as is experienced by drunkards, who on the day after a great exce&s;s of &s;pirituous potation feel indige&s;tion, head-ach, and general debility.</P>
<P>In this fit of torpor or quie&s;cence of a part or of the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power in the affected fibres is formed, and occa&s;ions a &s;econd paroxy&s;m of exertion by the applica|tion only of the natural &s;timulus, and thus a libration of the &s;en&s;orial exertion between one exce&s;s and the other continues for two or three days, where the &s;timulus was violent in degree; and for weeks in &s;ome fevers, from the &s;timulus of contagious matter.</P>
<P>But if a &s;econd do&s;e of opium be exhibited before the fibres have regained their natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, its effect will be much le&s;s than the former, becau&s;e the &s;pirit of animation or &s;en|&s;orial power is in part exhau&s;ted by the previous exce&s;s of exertion. Hence all medicines repeated too frequently gradually lo&s;e their effect, as opium and wine. Many things of di&s;agreeable ta&s;te at fir&s;t cea&s;e to be di&s;agreeable by frequent repetition, as tobacco; grief and pain gradually dimini&s;h, and at length cea&s;e altogether, and hence life it&s;elf becomes tolerable.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the temporary diminution of the &s;pirit of animation or &s;en|&s;orial power, which is naturally &s;tationary or re&s;ident in every living fibre, by a &s;ingle exhibition of a powerful &s;timulus, the contractile fibres them&s;elves, by the perpetual application of a new quantity of &s;timulus, before they have regained their natural quantity of &s;&s;n&s;orial power, appear to &s;uffer in their capability of receiving &s;o much as the natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; and hence a permanent defici|ency
<PB N="82" REF="96">
of &s;pirit of animation takes place, however long the &s;timulus may have been withdrawn. On this cau&s;e depends the permanent debility of tho&s;e, who have been addicted to intoxication, the general weakne&s;s of old age, and the natural debility or inirritability of tho&s;e, who have pale &s;kins and large pupils of their eyes.</P>
<P>There is a curious phenomenon belongs to this place, which has always appeared difficult of &s;olution; and that is, that opium or aloes may be exhibited in &s;mall do&s;es at fir&s;t, and gradually increa&s;ed to very large ones without producing &s;tupor or diarrhoea. In this ca&s;e, though the opium and aloes are given in &s;uch &s;mall do&s;es as not to produce intoxication or cathar&s;is, yet they are exhibited in quantities &s;ufficient in &s;ome degree to exhau&s;t the &s;en&s;orial power, and hence a &s;tronger and a &s;tronger do&s;e is required; otherwi&s;e the medicine would &s;oon cea&s;e to act at all.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if the opium or aloes be exhibited in a large do&s;e at fir&s;t, &s;o as to produce intoxication or diarrhoea; after a few repe|titions the quantity of either of them may be dimini&s;hed, and they will &s;till produce this effect. For the more powerful &s;timulus di&s;|&s;evers the progre&s;&s;ive catenations of animal motions, de&s;cribed in Sect. XVII. and introduces a new link between them; whence every repetition &s;trengthens this new a&s;&s;ociation or catenation, and the &s;ti|mulus may be gradually decrea&s;ed, or be nearly withdrawn, and yet the effect &s;hall continue; becau&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation or catenation being united with the &s;timulus, increa&s;es in energy with every repetition of the catenated circle; and it is by the&s;e means that all the irritative a&s;&s;ociations of motions are originally produced.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a &s;timulus is repeated at &s;uch di&s;tant intervals of time, that the natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power becomes completely re|&s;tored in the acting fibres, it will act with the &s;ame energy as when fir&s;t applied. Hence tho&s;e who have lately accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to large do&s;es of opium by beginning with &s;mall ones, and gradually in|crea&s;ing them, and repeating them frequently, as mentioned in the
<PB N="83" REF="97">
preceding paragraph; if they intermit the u&s;e of it for a few days only, mu&s;t begin again with as &s;mall do&s;es as they took at fir&s;t, other|wi&s;e they will experience the inconveniences of intoxication.</P>
<P>On this circum&s;tance depend the con&s;tant unfailing effects of the various kinds of &s;timulus, which excite into action all the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems in the body; the arterial, venous, ab&s;orbent, and glandular ve&s;&s;els, are brought into perpetual unwearied action by the fluids, which are adapted to &s;timulate them; but the&s;e have the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation added to that of irritation, and even in &s;ome de|gree that of &s;en&s;ation, and even of volition, as will be &s;poken of in their places; and life it&s;elf is thus carried on by the production of &s;en|&s;orial power being equal to its wa&s;te or expenditure in the perpetual movement of the va&s;cular organization.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a &s;timulus is repeated at uniform intervals of time with &s;uch di&s;tances between them, that the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the acting fibres becomes completely renewed, the effect is pro|duced with greater facility or energy. For the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is combined with the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, or, in common language, the acquired habit a&s;&s;i&s;ts the power of the &s;timulus.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance not only obtains in the annual and diurnal cate|nations of animal motions explained in Sect. XXXVI. but in every le&s;s circle of actions or ideas, as in the burthen of a &s;ong, or the ite|rations of a dance; and con&s;titutes the plea&s;ure we receive from re|petition and imitation; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 2.</P>
<P N="4">4. When a &s;timulus has been many times repeated at uniform in|tervals, &s;o as to produce the complete action of the organ, it may then be gradually dimini&s;hed, or totally withdrawn, and the action of the organ will continue. For the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation becomes united with that of irritation, and by frequent repetition be|comes at length of &s;ufficient energy to carry on the new link in
<PB N="84" REF="98">
the circle of actions, without the irritation which at fir&s;t intro|duced it.</P>
<P>Hence, when the bark is given at &s;tated intervals for the cure of intermittent fevers, if &s;ixty grains of it be given every three hours for the twenty-four hours preceding the expected paroxy&s;m, &s;o as to &s;ti|mulate the defective part of the &s;y&s;tem into action, and by that means to prevent the torpor or quie&s;cence of the fibres, which con&s;titutes the cold fit; much le&s;s than half the quantity, given before the time at which another paroxy&s;m of quie&s;cence would have taken place, will be &s;ufficient to prevent it; becau&s;e now the &s;en&s;orial power, termed a&s;&s;ociation, acts in a twofold manner. Fir&s;t, in re&s;pect to the period of the catenation in which the cold fit was produced, which is now di&s;&s;evered by the &s;tronger &s;timulus of the fir&s;t do&s;es of the bark; and, &s;econdly, becau&s;e each do&s;e of bark being repeated at periodical times, has its effect increa&s;ed by the &s;en&s;orial faculty of a&s;&s;ociation being com|bined with that of irritation.</P>
<P>Now, when &s;ixty grains of Peruvian bark are taken twice a day, &s;uppo&s;e at ten o'clock and at &s;ix, for a fortnight, the irritation ex|cited by this additional &s;timulus becomes a part of the diurnal circle of actions, and will at length carry on the increa&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;timulus of the bark. On this theory the bitter medicines, chalybeates, and opiates in appropri|ated do&s;es, exhibited for a fortnight, give permanent &s;trength to pale feeble children, and other weak con&s;titutions.</P>
<P N="5">5. When a defect of &s;timulus, as of heat, recurs at certain diurnal intervals, which induces &s;ome torpor or quie&s;cence of a part of the &s;y&s;tem, the diurnal catenation of actions becomes di&s;ordered, and a new a&s;&s;ociation with this link of torpid action is formed; on the next period the quantity of quie&s;cence will be increa&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame defect of &s;timulus to recur, becau&s;e now the new a&s;&s;ociation con|&s;pires
<PB N="85" REF="99">
with the defective irritation in introducing the torpid action of this part of the diurnal catenation. In this manner many fever|fits commence, where the patient is for &s;ome days indi&s;po&s;ed at cer|tain hours, before the cold paroxi&s;m of fever is completely formed. See Sect. XVII. 3. 3. on Catenation of Animal Motions.</P>
<P N="6">6. If a &s;timulus, which at fir&s;t excited the affected organ into &s;o great exertion as to produce &s;en&s;ation, be continued for a certain time, it will cea&s;e to produce &s;en&s;ation both then and when repeated, though the irritative motions in con&s;equence of it may continue or be re|excited.</P>
<P>Many catenations of irritative motions were at fir&s;t &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation, as the apparent motions of objects when we walk pa&s;t them, and probably the vital motions them&s;elves in the early &s;tate of our ex|i&s;tence. But as tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations were followed by no movements of the &s;y&s;tem in con&s;equence of them, they gradually cea&s;ed to be pro|duced, not being joined to any &s;ucceeding link of catenation. Hence contagious matter, which has for &s;ome weeks &s;timulated the &s;y&s;tem into great and permanent &s;en&s;ation, cea&s;es afterwards to produce gene|ral &s;en&s;ation, or inflammation, though it may &s;till induce topical irri|tations. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 8. XIX. 10.</P>
<P>Our ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem then &s;eems to receive tho&s;e contagious mat|ters, which it has before experienced, in the &s;ame manner as it im|bibes common moi&s;ture or other fluids; that is, without being thrown into &s;o violent action as to produce &s;en&s;ation; the con&s;e|quence of which is an increa&s;e of daily energy or activity, till inflam|mation and its con&s;equences &s;ucceed.</P>
<P N="7">7. If a &s;timulus excites an organ into &s;uch violent contractions as to produce &s;en&s;ation, the motions of which organ had not u&s;ually pro|duced &s;en&s;ation, this new &s;en&s;orial power, added to the irritation oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;timulus, increa&s;es the activity of the organ. And if this activity be catenated with the diurnal circle of actions, and in|crea&s;ing inflammation is produced; as in the evening paroxy&s;ms of
<PB N="86" REF="100">
&s;mall-pox, and other fevers with inflammation. And hence &s;chirrous tumours, tendons and membranes, and probably the arteries them|&s;elves become inflamed, when they are &s;trongly &s;timulated.</P>

<HEAD>IV. Of Stimulus greater than natural.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A quantity of &s;timulus greater than natural, producing an in|crea&s;ed exertion of &s;en&s;orial power, whether that exertion be in the mode of irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation, dimini&s;hes the general quantity of it. This fact is ob&s;ervable in the progre&s;s of in|toxication, as the increa&s;ed quantity or energy of the irritative mo|tions, owing to the &s;timulus of vinous &s;pirit, introduces much plea|&s;urable &s;en&s;ation into the &s;y&s;tem, and much exertion of mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual motions in con&s;equence of this increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation; the volun|tary motions, and even the a&s;&s;ociate ones, become much impaired or dimini&s;hed; and delirium and &s;taggering &s;ucceed. See Sect. XXI. on Drunkenne&s;s. And hence the great pro&s;tration of the &s;trength of the locomotive mu&s;cles in &s;ome fevers, is owing to the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power by the increa&s;ed action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In like manner a &s;timulus greater than natural, applied to a part of the &s;y&s;tem, increa&s;es the exertion of &s;en&s;orial power in that part, and dimini&s;hes it in &s;ome other part. As in the commencement of &s;carlet fever, it is u&s;ual to &s;ee great redne&s;s and heat on the faces and brea&s;ts of children, while at the &s;ame time their &s;eet are colder than natural; partial heats are ob&s;ervable in other fevers with debility, and are ge|nerally attended with torpor or quie&s;cence of &s;ome other part of the &s;y&s;tem. But the&s;e partial exertions of &s;en&s;orial power are &s;ometimes attended with increa&s;ed partial exertions in other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which &s;ympathize with them, as the flu&s;hing of the face after a full meal. Both the&s;e therefore are to be a&s;cribed to &s;ympathetic a&s;&s;oci|ations,
<PB N="87" REF="101">
explained in Sect. XXXV. and not to general exhau&s;tion or accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P N="2">2. A quantity of &s;timulus greater than natural, producing an in|crea&s;ed exertion of &s;en&s;orial power in any particular organ, dimini&s;hes the quantity of it in that organ. This appears from the contractions of animal fibres being not &s;o ea&s;ily excited by a le&s;s &s;timulus after the organ has been &s;ubjected to a greater. Thus after looking at any lu|minous object of a &s;mall &s;ize, as at the &s;etting &s;un, for a &s;hort time, &s;o as not much to fatigue the eye, this part of the retina becomes le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to &s;maller quantities of light; hence when the eyes are turned on other le&s;s luminous parts of the &s;ky, a dark &s;pot is &s;een re&s;embling the &s;hape of the &s;un, or other luminous object which we la&s;t behold. See Sect. XL. No. 2.</P>
<P>Thus we are &s;ome time before we can di&s;tingui&s;h objects in an ob&s;cure room after coming from bright day-light, though the iris pre&s;ently contracts it&s;elf. We are not able to hear weak &s;ounds after loud ones. And the &s;tomachs of tho&s;e who have been much habituated to the &s;tronger &s;timulus of fermented or &s;pirituous liquors, are not excited into due action by weaker ones.</P>
<P N="3">3. A quantity of &s;timulus &s;omething greater than the la&s;t men|tioned, or longer continued, induces the organ into &s;pa&s;modic action, which cea&s;es and recurs alternately. Thus on looking for a time on the &s;etting &s;un, &s;o as not greatly to &s;atigue the &s;ight, a yellow &s;pec|trum is &s;een when the eyes are clo&s;ed and covered, which continues for a time, and then di&s;appears and recurs repeatedly before it entirely vani&s;hes. See Sect. XL. No. 5. Thus the action of vomiting cea&s;es and is renewed by intervals, although the emetic drug is thrown up with the fir&s;t effort. A tene&s;mus continues by intervals &s;ome time after the exclu&s;ion of acrid excrement; and the pul&s;ations of the heart of a viper are &s;aid to continue &s;ome time after it is cleared from its blood.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="102">
In the&s;e ca&s;es the violent contractions of the fibres produce pain according to law 4; and this pain con&s;titutes an additional kind or quantity of excitement, which again induces the fibres into contrac|tion, and which painful excitement is again renewed, and again in|duces contractions of the fibres with gradually dimini&s;hing effect.</P>
<P N="4">4. A quantity of &s;timulus greater than that la&s;t mentioned, or longer continued, induces the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles into &s;pa&s;modic ac|tion. This is beautifully illu&s;trated by the ocular &s;pectra de&s;cribed in Sect. XL. No. 6. to which the reader is referred. From tho&s;e experiments there is rea&s;on to conclude that the fatigued part of the retina throws it&s;elf into a contrary mode of action like o&s;citation or pandiculation, as &s;oon as the &s;timulus, which has fatigued it, is withdrawn; but that it &s;till remains liable to be excited into action by any other colours except the colour with which it has been fa|tigued. Thus the yawning and &s;tretching the limbs after a con|tinued action or attitude &s;eems occa&s;ioned by the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles being &s;timulated by their exten&s;ion during the contractions of tho&s;e in action, or in the &s;ituation in which that action la&s;t left them.</P>
<P N="5">5. A quantity of &s;timulus greater than the la&s;t, or longer conti|nued, induces variety of convul&s;ions or fixed &s;pa&s;ms either of the af|fected organ or of the moving fibres in the other parts of the body. In re&s;pect to the &s;pectra in the eye, this is well illu&s;trated in No. 7 and 8, of Sect. XL. Epilectic convul&s;ions, as the empro&s;thotonos and opi&s;thotonos, with the cramp of the calf of the leg, locked jaw, and other cataleptic fits, appear to originate from pain, as &s;ome of the&s;e patients &s;cream aloud before the convul&s;ion takes place; which &s;eems at fir&s;t to be an effort to relieve painful &s;en&s;ation, and after|wards an effort to prevent it.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the violent contractions of the fibres produce &s;o much pain, as to con&s;titute a perpetual excitement; and that in &s;o great a degree as to allow but &s;mall intervals of relaxation of the con|tracting
<PB N="89" REF="103">
fibres as in convul&s;ions, or no intervals at all as in fixed &s;pa&s;ms.</P>
<P N="6">6. A quantity of &s;timulus greater than the la&s;t, or longer con|tinued, produces a paraly&s;is of the organ. In many ca&s;es this para|ly&s;is is only a temporary effect, as on looking long on a &s;mall area of bright red &s;ilk placed on a &s;heet of white paper on the floor in a &s;trong light, the red &s;ilk gradually becomes paler, and at length di&s;appears; which evinces that a part of the retina, by being violently excited, becomes for a time unaffected by the &s;timulus of that colour. Thus cathartic medicines, opiates, poi&s;ons, contageous matter, cea&s;e to in|fluence our &s;y&s;tem after it has been habituated to the u&s;e of them, except by the exhibition of increa&s;ed quantities of them; our fibres not only become unaffected by &s;timuli, by which they have previ|ou&s;ly been violently irritated, as by the matter of the &s;mall-pox or mea&s;les; but they al&s;o become unaffected by &s;en&s;ation, where the violent exertions, which di&s;abled them, were in con&s;equence of too great quantity of &s;en&s;ation. And la&s;tly the fibres, which become di&s;obedient to volition, are probably di&s;abled by their too violent exertions in con&s;equence of too great a quantity of vo|lition.</P>
<P>After every exertion of our fibres a temporary paraly&s;is &s;ucceeds, whence the intervals of all mu&s;cular contractions, as mentioned in No. 3 and 4 of this Section; the immediate cau&s;e of the&s;e more per|manent kinds of paraly&s;is is probably owing in the &s;ame manner to the too great exhau&s;tion of the &s;pirit of animation in the affected part; &s;o that a &s;tronger &s;timulus is required, or one of a different kind from that, which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e too violent contractions, to again excite the affected organ into activity; and if a &s;tronger &s;timulus could be applied, it mu&s;t again induce paraly&s;is.</P>
<P>For the&s;e powerful &s;timuli excite pain at the &s;ame time, that they produce irritation; and this pain not only excites fibrous motions by its &s;timulus, but it al&s;o produces volition; and thus all the&s;e &s;timuli
<PB N="90" REF="104">
acting at the &s;ame time, and &s;ometimes with the addition of their a&s;|&s;ociations, produce &s;o great exertion as to expend the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power in the affected fibres.</P>

<HEAD>V. Of Stimulus le&s;s than natural.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A quantity of &s;timulus le&s;s than natural, producing a decrea&s;ed exertion of &s;en&s;orial power, occa&s;ions an accumulation of the general quantity of it. This circum&s;tance is ob&s;ervable in the haemiplagia, in which the patients are perpetually moving the mu&s;cles, which are unaffected. On this account we awake with greater vigour after &s;leep, becau&s;e during &s;o many hours, the great u&s;ual expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the performance of voluntary actions, and in the exertions of our organs of &s;en&s;e, in con&s;equence of the irritations oc|ca&s;ioned by external objects had been &s;u&s;pended, and a con&s;equent ac|cumulation had taken place.</P>
<P>In like manner the exertion of the &s;en&s;orial power le&s;s than natural in one part of the &s;y&s;tem, is liable to produce an increa&s;e of the ex|ertion of it in &s;ome other part. Thus by the action of vomiting, in which the natural exertion of the motions of the &s;tomach are de|&s;troyed or dimini&s;hed, an increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the pulmonary and cellular lymphatics is produced, as is known by the increa&s;ed ab&s;orp|tion of the fluid depo&s;ited in them in drop&s;ical ca&s;es. But the&s;e par|tial quie&s;cences of &s;en&s;orial power are al&s;o &s;ometimes attended with other partial quie&s;cences, which &s;ympathize with them, as cold and pale extremities from hunger. The&s;e therefore are to be a&s;cribed to the a&s;&s;ociations of &s;ympathy explained in Sect. XXXV. and not to the general accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P N="2">2. A quantity of &s;timulus le&s;s than natural, applied to fibres pre|viou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to perpetual &s;timulus, is &s;ucceeded by accumula|tion
<PB N="91" REF="105">
of &s;en&s;orial power in the affected organ. The truth of this pro|po&s;ition is evinced, becau&s;e a &s;timulus le&s;s than natural, if it be &s;omewhat greater than that above mentioned, will excite the organ &s;o circum&s;tanced into violent activity. Thus on a fro&s;ty day with wind, the face of a per&s;on expo&s;ed to the wind is at fir&s;t pale and &s;hrunk; but on turning the face from the wind, it becomes &s;oon of a glow with warmth and flu&s;hing. The glow of the Ikin in emerg|ing from the cold-bath is owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power above the natural quantity is acquired by tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are not &s;ub|ject to perpetual &s;timulus, as the locomotive mu&s;cles: the&s;e, after the greate&s;t fatigue, only acquire by re&s;t their u&s;ual aptitude to motion; whereas the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, as the heart and arteries, after a &s;hort quie&s;cence, are thrown into violent action by their natural quantity of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s by this accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the application of decrea&s;ed &s;timulus, and by the exhau&s;tion of it during the action of increa&s;ed &s;timulus, it is wi&s;ely provided, that the ac|tions of the va&s;cular mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e are not much de|ranged by &s;mall variations of &s;timulus; as the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power becomes in &s;ome mea&s;ure inver&s;ely as the quantity of &s;ti|mulus.</P>
<P N="3">3. A quantity of &s;timulus le&s;s than that mentioned above, and continued for &s;ome time, induces pain in the affected organ, as the pain of cold in the hands, when they are immer&s;ed in &s;now, is owing to a deficiency of the &s;timulation of heat. Hunger is a pain from the deficiency of the &s;timulation of food. Pain in the back at the com|mencement of ague-fits, and the head-achs which attend feeble peo|ple, are pains from defect of &s;timulus, and are hence relieved by opi|um, e&s;&s;ential oils, &s;pirit of wine.</P>
<P>As the pains, which originate from defect of &s;timulus, only occur in tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which have been previou&s;y &s;ubjected to
<PB N="92" REF="106">
perpetual &s;timulus; and as an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power is pro|duced in the quie&s;cent organ along with the pain, as in cold or hunger, there is rea&s;on to believe, that the pain is owing to the ac|cumulation of &s;en&s;orial power. For, in the locomotive mu&s;cles, in the retina of the eye, and other organs of &s;en&s;es, no pain occurs from the ab&s;ence of &s;timulus, nor any great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power beyond their natural quantity, &s;ince the&s;e organs have not been u&s;ed to a perpetual &s;upply of it. There is indeed a greater ac|cumulation occurs in the organ of vi&s;ion after its quie&s;cence, becau&s;e it is &s;ubject to more con&s;tant &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="4">4. A certain quantity of &s;timulus le&s;s than natural induces the moving organ into feebler and more frequent contractions, as men|tioned in No. I. 4. of this Section. For each contraction moving through a le&s;s &s;pace, or with le&s;s force, that is, with le&s;s expendi|ture of the &s;pirit of animation, is &s;ooner relaxed, and the &s;pirit of ani|mation derived at each interval into the acting fibres being le&s;s, the&s;e intervals likewi&s;e become &s;horter. Hence the tremours of the hands of people accu&s;tomed to vinous &s;pirit, till they take their u&s;ual &s;timu|lus; hence the quick pul&s;e in fevers attended with debility, which is greater than in fevers attended with &s;trength; in the latter the pul&s;e &s;eldom beats above 120 times in a minute, in the former it fre|quently exceeds 140.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in this and the two following articles the decrea&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem is probably more frequently occa&s;ioned by deficiency in the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, than in the quantity of &s;timulus. Thus tho&s;e feeble con&s;titutions which have large pupils of their eyes, and all who labour under nervous fevers, &s;eem to owe their want of natural quantity of activity in the &s;y&s;tem to the defici|ency of &s;en&s;orial power; &s;ince, as far as can be &s;een, they frequently po&s;&s;e&s;s the natural quantity of &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="5">5. A certain quantity of &s;timulus, le&s;s than that above mentioned, inverts the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fibrous contractions; as in vomiting
<PB N="93" REF="107">
the vermicular motions of the &s;tomach and duodenum are inverted, and their contents ejected, which is probably owing to the exhau&s;tion of the &s;pirit of animation in the acting mu&s;cles by a previous exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, as by the root of ipecacuanha, and the con&s;equent defect of &s;en&s;orial power. The &s;ame retrograde motions affect the whole inte&s;tinal canal in ileus; and the oe&s;ophagus in globus hy&s;tericus. See this further explained in Sect. XXIX. No. 11. on Retrograde Motions.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, al&s;o, that &s;omething &s;imilar happens in the pro|duction of our ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, when they are too weakly excited; when any one is thinking inten&s;ely about one thing, and carele&s;sly conver&s;ing about another, he is liable to u&s;e the word of a contrary meaning to that which he de&s;igned, as cold weather for hot weather, &s;ummer for winter.</P>
<P N="6">6. A certain quantity of &s;timulus, le&s;s than that above mentioned, is &s;ucceeded by paraly&s;is, fir&s;t of the voluntary and &s;en&s;itive motions, and afterwards of tho&s;e of irritation and of a&s;&s;ociation, which con&s;ti|tutes death.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Cure of increa&s;ed Exertion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The cure, which nature has provided for the increa&s;ed exertion of any part of the &s;y&s;tem, con&s;i&s;ts in the con&s;equent expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power. But as a greater torpor follows this exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, as explained in the next paragraph, and a greater ex|ertion &s;ucceeds this torpor, the con&s;titution frequently &s;inks under the&s;e increa&s;ing librations between exertion and quie&s;cence; till at length complete quie&s;cence, that is, death, clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>For, during the great exertion of the &s;y&s;tem in the hot fit of fever, an increa&s;e of &s;timulus is produced from the greater momentum of
<PB N="94" REF="108">
the blood, the greater di&s;tention of the heart and arteries, and the in|crea&s;ed production of heat, by the violent actions of the &s;y&s;tem oc|ca&s;ioned by this augmentation of &s;timulus, the &s;en&s;orial power be|comes dimini&s;hed in a few hours much beneath its natural quantity, the ve&s;&s;els at length cea&s;e to obey even the&s;e great degrees of &s;timulus, as &s;hewn in Sect. XL. 9. 1. and a torpor of the whole or of a part of the &s;y&s;tem en&s;ues.</P>
<P>Now as this &s;econd cold fit commences with a greater deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, it is al&s;o attended with a greater deficiency of &s;timu|lus than in the preceding cold fit, that is, with le&s;s momentum of blood, le&s;s di&s;tention of the heart. On this account the &s;econd cold fit becomes more violent and of longer duration than the fir&s;t; and as a greater accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power mu&s;t be produced before the &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els will again obey the dimini&s;hed &s;timulus, it follows, that the &s;econd hot fit of fever will be more violent than the former one. And that unle&s;s &s;ome other cau&s;es counteract either the violent exertions in the hot fit, or the great torpor in the cold fit, life will at length be extingui&s;hed by the expenditure of the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power. And from hence it appears, that the true means of curing fevers mu&s;t be &s;uch as decrea&s;e the action of the &s;y&s;tem in the hot fit, and increa&s;e it in the cold fit; that is, &s;uch as prevent the too great diminution of &s;en&s;orial power in the hot fit, and the too great accumulation of it in the cold one.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where the exertion of the &s;en&s;orial powers is much increa&s;ed, as in the hot-fits of fever or inflammation, the following are the u&s;ual means of relieving it. Decrea&s;e the irritations by blood-letting, and other evacuations; by cold water taken into the &s;tomach, or injected as an enema, or u&s;ed externally; by cold air breathed into the lungs, and diffu&s;ed over the &s;kin; with food of le&s;s &s;timulus than the patient has been accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P N="3">3. As a cold fit, or paroxy&s;m of inactivity of &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem, generally precedes the hot fit, or paroxy&s;m of exertion, by
<PB N="95" REF="109">
which the &s;en&s;orial power becomes accumulated, this cold paroxy&s;m &s;hould be prevented by &s;timulant medicines and diet, as wine, opium, bark, warmth, cheerfulne&s;s, anger, &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. Excite into greater action &s;ome other part of the &s;y&s;tem, by which means the &s;pirit of animation may be in part expended, and thence the inordinate actions of the di&s;ea&s;ed part may be le&s;&s;ened. Hence when a part of the &s;kin acts violently, as of the face in the eruption of the &s;mall-pox, if the feet be cold they &s;hould be covered. Hence the u&s;e of a bli&s;ter applied near a topical inflammation. Hence opium and warm bath relieve pains both from exce&s;s and defect of &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fir&s;t increa&s;e the general &s;timulation above its natural quantity, which may in &s;ome degree exhau&s;t the &s;pirit of animation, and then decrea&s;e the &s;timulation beneath its natural quantity. Hence after &s;udorific medicines and warm air, the application of refrigerants may have greater effect, if they could be admini&s;tered without danger of producing too great torpor of &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem; as frequently happens to people in health from coming out of a warm room into the cold air, by which a topical inflammation in con&s;equence of torpor of the mucous membrane of the no&s;tril is produced, and is termed a cold in the head.</P>

<HEAD>VII. Cure of decrea&s;ed Exertion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHERE the exertion of the &s;en&s;orial powers is much decrea&s;ed, as in the cold fits of fever, as gradual accumulation of the &s;pirit of animation takes place; as occurs in all ca&s;es where inactivity or tor|por of a part of the &s;y&s;tem exi&s;ts; this accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power increa&s;es, till &s;timuli le&s;s than natural are &s;ufficient to throw it
<PB N="96" REF="110">
into action, then the cold fit cea&s;es; and from the action of the na|tural &s;timuli a hot one &s;ucceeds with increa&s;ed activity of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>So in fainting fits, or &s;yncope, there is a temporary deficiency of &s;en&s;orial exertion, and a con&s;equent quie&s;cence of a great part of the &s;y&s;tem. This quie&s;cence continues, till the &s;en&s;orial power becomes again accumulated in the torpid organs; and then the u&s;ual diurnal &s;timuli excite the revive&s;cent parts again into action; but as this kind of quie&s;cence continues but a &s;hort time compared to the cold parox|y&s;m of an ague, and le&s;s affects the circulatory &s;y&s;tem, a le&s;s &s;uper|abundancy of exertion &s;ucceeds in the organs previou&s;ly torpid, and a le&s;s exce&s;s of arterial activity. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the di&s;ea&s;es occa&s;ioned by a defect of &s;en&s;orial exertion, as in cold fits of ague, hy&s;teric complaint, and nervous fever, the follow|ing means are tho&s;e commonly u&s;ed. 1. Increa&s;e the &s;timulation above its natural quantity for &s;ome weeks, till a new habit of more energetic contraction of the fibres is e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is to be done by wine, opium, bark, &s;teel, given at exact periods, and in appro|priate quantities; for if the&s;e medicines be given in &s;uch quantity, as to induce the lea&s;t degree of intoxication, a debility &s;ucceeds from the u&s;ele&s;s exhau&s;tion of &s;pirit of animation in con&s;equence of too great exertion of the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e. To the&s;e irritative &s;timuli &s;hould be added the &s;en&s;itive ones of cheerful ideas, hope, affection.</P>
<P N="3">3. Change the kinds of &s;timulus. The habits acquired by the con&s;titution depend on &s;uch nice circum&s;tances, that when one kind of &s;timulus cea&s;es to excite the &s;en&s;orial power into the quantity of exertion nece&s;&s;ary to health, it is often &s;ufficient to change the &s;ti|mulus for another apparently &s;imilar in quantity and quality. Thus when wine cea&s;es to &s;timulate the con&s;titution, opium in appropriate do&s;es &s;upplies the defect; and the contrary. This is al&s;o ob&s;erved in
<PB N="97" REF="111">
the effects of cathartic medicines, when one lo&s;es its power, another, apparently le&s;s efficacious, will &s;ucceed. Hence a change of diet, drink, and &s;timulating medicines, is often advantageous in di&s;ea&s;es of debility.</P>
<P N="4">4. Stimulate the organs, who&s;e motions are a&s;&s;ociated with the torpid parts of the &s;y&s;tem. The actions of the minute ve&s;&s;els of the various parts of the external &s;kin are not only a&s;&s;ociated with each other, but are &s;trongly a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of &s;ome of the internal membranes, and particularly of the &s;tomach. Hence when the ex|ertion of the &s;tomach is le&s;s than natural, and indige&s;tion and heart|burn &s;ucceed, nothing &s;o certainly removes the&s;e &s;ymptoms as the &s;timulus of a bli&s;ter on the back. The coldne&s;s of the extremities, as of the no&s;e, ears, or fingers, are hence the be&s;t indication for the &s;ucce&s;sful application of bli&s;ters.</P>
<P N="5">5. Decrea&s;e the &s;timulus for a time. By le&s;&s;ening the quantity of heat for a minute or two by going into the cold bath, a great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power is produced; for not only the minute ve&s;&s;els of the whole external &s;kin for a time become inactive, as appears by their palene&s;s; but the minute ve&s;&s;els of the lungs lo&s;e much of their ac|tivity al&s;o by concert with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, as appears from the dif|ficulty of breathing at fir&s;t going into cold water. On emerging from the bath the &s;en&s;orial power is thrown into great exertion by the &s;timulus of the common degree of the warmth of the atmo|&s;phere, and a great production of animal heat is the con&s;equence. The longer a per&s;on continues in the cold bath the greater mu&s;t be the pre&s;ent inertion of a great part of the &s;y&s;tem, and in con&s;equence a greater accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power. Whence M. Pome r&egrave;|commends &s;ome melancholy patients to be kept from two to &s;ix hours in &s;pring-water, and in baths &s;till colder.</P>
<P N="6">6 Decrea&s;e the &s;timulus for a time below the natural, and then increa&s;e it above natural. The effect of this proce&s;s, improperly u&s;ed, is &s;een in giving much food, or applying much warmth, to tho&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="112">
who have been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to great hunger, or to great cold. The accumulated &s;en&s;orial power is thrown into &s;o violent exertion, that inflammations and mortifications &s;upervene, and death clo&s;es the cata&s;trophe. In many di&s;ea&s;es this method is the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; hence the bark in agues produces more certain effect after the previ|ous exhibition of emetics. In di&s;ea&s;es attended with violent pain, opium has double the effect, if vene&s;ection and a cathartic have been previou&s;ly u&s;ed. On this &s;eems to have been founded the &s;ucce&s;sful practice of Sydenham, who u&s;ed vene&s;ection and a cathartic in chlo|ro&s;is before the exhibition of the bark, &s;teel, and opiates.</P>
<P N="7">7. Prevent any unnece&s;&s;ary expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power. Hence in fevers with debility, a decumbent po&s;ture is preferred, with &s;ilence, little light, and &s;uch a quantity of heat as may prevent any chill &s;en|&s;ation, or any coldne&s;s of the extremities. The pul&s;e of patients in fevers with debility increa&s;es in frequency above ten pul&s;ations in a minute on their ri&s;ing out of bed. For the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power to pre&s;erve an erect po&s;ture of the body adds to the general de|ficiency of it, and thus affects the circulation.</P>
<P N="8">8. The longer in time and the greater in degree the quie&s;cence or inertion of an organ has been, &s;o that it &s;till retains life or excitability, the le&s;s &s;timulus &s;hould at fir&s;t be applied to it. The quantity of &s;ti|mulation is a matter of great nicety to determine, where the torpor or quie&s;cence of the fibres has been experienced in a great degree, or for a con&s;iderable time, as in cold fits of the ague, in continued fevers with great debility, or in people fami&s;hed at &s;ea, or peri&s;hing with cold. In the two la&s;t ca&s;es, very minute quantities of food &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;upplied, and very few additional degrees of heat. In the two former ca&s;es, but little &s;timulus of wine or medicine, above what they had been lately accu&s;tomed to, &s;hould be exhibited, and this at frequent and &s;tated intervals, &s;o that the effect of one quantity may be ob&s;erved before the exhibition of another.</P>
<P>If the&s;e circum&s;tances are not attended to, as the &s;en&s;orial power
<PB N="99" REF="113">
becomes accumulated in the quie&s;cent fibres, an inordinate exertion takes place by the increa&s;e of &s;timulus acting on the accumulated quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, and either the paraly&s;is, or death of the contractile fibres en&s;ues, from the total expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power in the affected organ, owing to this increa&s;e of exertion, like the debility after intoxication. Or, &s;econdly, the violent exertions above mentioned produce painful &s;en&s;ation, which becomes a new &s;timulus, and by thus producing inflammation, and increa&s;ing the activity of the fibres already too great, &s;ooner exhau&s;ts the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power in the acting organ, and mortification, that is, the death of the part, &s;upervenes.</P>
<P>Hence there have been many in&s;tances of people, who&s;e limbs have been long benumbed by expo&s;ure to cold, who have lo&s;t them by mortification on their being too ha&s;tily brought to the fire; and of others, who were nearly fami&s;hed at &s;ea, who have died &s;oon after having taken not more than an u&s;ual meal of food. I have heard of two well-atte&s;ted in&s;tances of patients in the cold fit of ague, who have died from the exhibition of gin and vinegar, by the inflammation which en&s;ued. And in many fevers attended with debility, the un|limited u&s;e of wine, and the wanton application of bli&s;ters, I believe, has de&s;troyed numbers by the debility con&s;equent to too great &s;timu|lation, that is, by the exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power by its in|ordinate exertion.</P>
<P>Wherever the lea&s;t degree of intoxication exi&s;ts, a proportional de|bility is the con&s;equence; but there is a golden rule by which the nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful quantity of &s;timulus in fevers with debility may be a&s;certained. When wine or beer are exhibited either alone or di|luted with water, if the pul&s;e becomes &s;lower the &s;timulus is of a proper quantity; and &s;hould be repeated every two or three hours, or when the pul&s;e again becomes quicker.</P>
<P>In the chronical debility brought on by drinking &s;pirituous or fer|mented liquors, there is another golden rule by which I have &s;ucce&s;s|fully
<PB N="100" REF="114">
directed the quantity of &s;pirit which they may &s;afely le&s;&s;en, for there is no other means by which they can recover their health. It &s;hould be premi&s;ed, that where the power of dige&s;tion in the&s;e pa|tients is totally de&s;troyed, there is not much rea&s;on to expect a return to healthful vigour.</P>
<P>I have directed &s;everal of the&s;e patients to omit one fourth part of the quantity of vinous &s;pirit they have been lately accu&s;tomed to, and if in a fortnight their appetite increa&s;es, they are advi&s;ed to omit another fourth part; but if they perceive that their dige&s;tion becomes impaired from the want of this quantity of &s;pirituous potation, they are advi&s;ed to continue as they are, and rather bear the ills they have, than ri&s;k the encounter of greater. At the &s;ame time fle&s;h-meat with or without &s;pice is recommended, with Peruvian bark and &s;teel in &s;mall quantities between their meals, and half a grain of opium or a grain, with five or eight grains of rhubarb at night.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. THE fibres of the vegetable world, as well as tho&s;e of the animal, are excitable into a variety of motion by the irritations of ex|ternal objects. This appears particularly in the mimo&s;a or &s;en&s;itive plant, who&s;e leaves contract on the &s;lighte&s;t injury; the dionaea mu&s;|cipula, which was lately brought over from the mar&s;hes of America, pre&s;ents us with another curious in&s;tance of vegetable irritability; its leaves are armed with &s;pines on their upper edge, and are &s;pread on the ground around the &s;tem; when an in&s;ect creeps on any of them in its pa&s;&s;age to the flower or &s;eed, the leaf &s;huts up like a &s;teel rat|trap, and de&s;troys its enemy. See Botanic Garden, Part II. note on Silene.</P>
<P>The various &s;ecretions of vegetables, as of odour, fruit, gum, re&s;in, wax, honey, &s;eem brought about in the &s;ame manner as in the glands of animals: the ta&s;tele&s;s moi&s;ture of the earth is converted by the hop-plant into a bitter juice; as by the caterpillar in the nut|&s;hell
<PB N="102" REF="116">
the &s;weet kernel is converted into a bitter powder. While the power of ab&s;orption in the roots and barks of vegetables is excited into action by the fluids applied to their mouths like the lacteals and lymphatics of animals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The individuals of the vegetable world may be con&s;idered as in|ferior or le&s;s perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and in this re&s;pect re&s;embles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries of a multitude of animals. Each of the&s;e buds of a tree has its proper leaves or petals for lungs, produces its viviparous or its oviparous offspring in buds or &s;eeds; has its own roots, which extending down the &s;tem of the tree are interwoven with the roots of the other buds, and form the bark, which is the only living part of the &s;tem, is annually renewed, and is &s;uperinduced upon the former bark, which then dies, and with its &s;tagnated juices gradually hardening into wood forms the concentric circles, which we &s;ee in blocks of timber.</P>
<P>The following circum&s;tances evince the individuality of the buds of trees. Fir&s;t, there are many trees, who&s;e whole internal wood is peri&s;hed, and yet the branches are vegete and healthy. Secondly, the fibres of the barks of trees are chiefly longitudinal, re&s;embling roots, as is beautifully &s;een in tho&s;e prepared barks, that were lately brought from Otaheita. Thirdly, in horizontal wounds of the bark of trees, the fibres of the upper lip are always elongated downwards like roots, but tho&s;e of the lower lip do not approach to meet them. Fourthly, if you wrap wet mo&s;s round any joint of a vine, or cover it with moi&s;t earth, roots will &s;hoot out from it. Fifthly, by the inoculation or engra&s;ting of trees many fruits are produced from one &s;tem. Sixthly, a new tree is produced from a branch plucked from an old one, and &s;et in the ground. Whence it appears that the buds of deciduous trees are &s;o many annual plants, that the bark is a con|texture of the roots of each individual bud; and that the internal wood
<PB N="103" REF="117">
is of no other u&s;e but to &s;upport them in the air, and that thus they re&s;emble the animal world in their individuality.</P>
<P>The irritability of plants, like that of animals, appears liable to be increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed by habit; for tho&s;e trees or &s;hrubs, which are brought from a colder climate to a warmer, put out their leaves and blo&s;&s;oms a fortnight &s;ooner than the indigenous ones.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;or Kalm, in his Travels in New York, ob&s;erves that the apple-trees brought from England blo&s;&s;om a fortnight &s;ooner than the native ones. In our country the &s;hrubs, that are brought a degree or two from the north, are ob&s;erved to flouri&s;h better than tho&s;e, which come from the &s;outh. The Siberian barley and cabbage are &s;aid to grow larger in this climate than the &s;imilar more &s;outhern ve|getables. And our hoards of roots, as of potatoes and onions, ge|minate with le&s;s heat in &s;pring, after they have been accu&s;tomed to the winter's cold, than in autumn after the &s;ummer's heat.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The &s;tamens and pi&s;tils of flowers &s;hew evident marks of &s;en|&s;ibility, not only from many of the &s;tamens and &s;ome pi&s;tils approach|ing towards each other at the &s;ea&s;on of impregnation, but from many of them clo&s;ing their petals and calyxes during the cold parts of the day. For this cannot be a&s;cribed to irritation, becau&s;e cold means a defect of the &s;timulus of heat; but as the want of accu&s;tomed &s;timuli produces pain, as in coldne&s;s, hunger, and thir&s;t of animals, the&s;e motions of vegetables in clo&s;ing up their flowers mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and not to the irritation of cold. Others clo&s;e up their leaves during darkne&s;s, which, like the former, cannot be owing to irritation, as the irritating material is withdrawn.</P>
<P>The approach of the anthers in many flowers to the &s;tigmas, and of the pi&s;tils of &s;ome flowers to the anthers, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the pa&s;&s;ion of love, and hence belongs to &s;en&s;ation, not to irritation.</P>

<P>III. That the vegetable world po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome degree of voluntary powers, appears from their nece&s;&s;ity to &s;leep, which we have &s;hewn in Sect. XVIII. to con&s;i&s;t in the temporary abolition of voluntary

<P>IV. The a&s;&s;ociations of fibrous motions are ob&s;ervable in the ve|getable world, as well as in the animal. The divi&s;ions of the leaves of the &s;en&s;itive plant have been accu&s;tomed to contract at the &s;ame time from the ab&s;ence of light; hence if by any other circum&s;tance, as a &s;light &s;troke or injury, one divi&s;ion is irritated into contraction, the neighbouring ones contract al&s;o, from their motions being a&s;&s;oci|ated with tho&s;e of the irritated part. So the various &s;tamina of the cla&s;s of &s;yngene&s;ia have been accu&s;tomed to contract together in the evening, and thence if you &s;timulate one of them with a pin, accord|ing to the experiment of M. Colvolo, they all contract from their ac|quired a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>To evince that the collap&s;ing of the &s;en&s;itive plant is not owing to any mechanical vibrations propagated along the whole branch, when a &s;ingle leaf is &s;truck with the finger, a leaf of it was &s;lit with &s;harp &s;ci&s;&s;ors, and &s;ome &s;econds of time pa&s;&s;ed before the plant &s;eemed &s;en|&s;ible of the injury; and then the whole branch collap&s;ed as far as the principal &s;tem: this experiment was repeated &s;everal times with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible impul&s;e to the plant.</P>

It is there &s;hewn, that the roots of vegetables re&s;emble the lacteal &s;y&s;tem of animals; the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els in the early &s;pring, before their leaves expand, are analo|gous to the placental ve&s;&s;els of the foetus; that the leaves of land|plants re&s;emble lungs, and tho&s;e of aquatic plants the gills of &s;i&s;h; that there are other &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els re&s;embling the vena portarum of quadrupeds, or the aorta of fi&s;h; that the dige&s;tive power of ve|getables is &s;imiilar to that of animals converting the fluids, which they
<PB N="105" REF="119">
ab&s;orb, into &s;ugar; that their &s;eeds re&s;emble the eggs of animals, and their buds and bulbs their viviparous offspring. And, la&s;tly, that the anthers and &s;tigmas are real animals, attached indeed to their parent tree like polypi or coral in&s;ects, but capable of &s;pontaneous motion; that they are affected with the pa&s;&s;ion of love, and furni&s;hed with powers of reproducing their &s;pecies, and are fed with honey like the moths and butterflies, which plunder their nectaries. See Bota|nic Garden, Part I. add. note XXXIX.</P>
<P>The male flowers of valli&s;neria approach &s;till nearer to apparent animality, as they detach them&s;elves from the parent plant, and float on the &s;urface of the water to the female ones. Botanic Garden, Part II. Art. Valli&s;neria. Other flowers of the cla&s;&s;es of monecia and diecia, and polygamia, di&s;charge the fecundating farina, which float|ing in the air is carried to the &s;tigma of the female flowers, and that at con&s;iderable di&s;tances. Can this be affected by any &s;pecific attrac|tion? or, like the diffu&s;ion of the odorous particles of flowers, is it left to the currents of winds, and the accidental mi&s;carriages of it counteracted by the quantity of its production?</P>
<P N="2">2. This leads us to a curious enquiry, whether vegetables have ideas of external things? As all our ideas are originally received by our &s;en&s;es, the que&s;tion may be changed to, whether vegetables po&s;&s;e&s;s any organs of &s;en&s;e? Certain it is, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;en&s;e of heat and cold, another of moi&s;ture and dryne&s;s, and another of light and darkne&s;s; for they clo&s;e their petals occa&s;ionally from the pre|&s;ence of cold, moi&s;ture, or darkne&s;s. And it has been already &s;hewn, that the&s;e actions cannot be performed &s;imply from irritation, becau&s;e cold and darkne&s;s are negative quantities, and on that ac|count &s;en&s;ation or volition are implied, and in con&s;equence a &s;en&s;o|rium or union of their nerves. So when we go into the light, we contract the iris; not from any &s;timulus of the light on the fine mu&s;cles of the iris, but from its motions being a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;en&s;ation of too much light on the retina: which could not take
<PB N="106" REF="120">
place without a &s;en&s;orium or center of union of the nerves of the iris with tho&s;e of vi&s;ion. See Botanic Garden, Part I. Canto 3. l. 440. note.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e, which di&s;tingui&s;h cold, moi&s;ture, and darkne&s;s, the leaves of mimo&s;a, and of dionaea, and of dro&s;era, and the &s;tamens of many flowers, as of the berbery, and the numerous cla&s;s of &s;yngene&s;ia, are &s;en&s;ible to mechanic impact, that is, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;en&s;e of touch, as well as a common &s;en&s;orium; by the medium of which their mu&s;cles are excited into action. La&s;tly, in many flowers the anthers, when mature, approach the &s;tigma, in others the female organ approaches to the male. In a plant of collin|&s;onia, a branch of which is now before me, the two yellow &s;tamens are about three eights of an inch high, and diverge from each other, at an angle of about fifteen degrees, the purple &s;tyle is half an inch, high, and in &s;ome flowers is now applied to the &s;tamen on the right hand, and in others to that of the left; and will, I &s;uppo&s;e, change place to-morrow in tho&s;e, where the anthers have not yet effu&s;ed their powder.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, by what means are the anthers in many flowers, and &s;tigmas in other flowers, directed to find their paramours? How do either of them know, that the other exi&s;ts in their vicinity? Is this curious kind of &s;torge produced by mechanic attraction, or by the &s;en&s;ation of love? The latter opinion is &s;upported by the &s;tronge&s;t analogy, becau&s;e a reproduction of the &s;pecies is the con&s;equence; and then another organ of &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be wanted to direct the&s;e vegetable amourettes to find each other, one probably analogous to our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell, which in the animal world directs the new-born infant to its &s;ource of nou|ri&s;hment, and they may thus po&s;&s;e&s;s a faculty of perceiving as well as of producing odours.</P>
<P>Thus, be&s;ides a kind of ta&s;te at the extremities of their roots, &s;imi|lar to that of the extremities of our lacteal ve&s;&s;els, for the purpo&s;e of &s;electing their proper food; and be&s;ides different kinds of irritability
<PB N="107" REF="121">
re&s;iding in the various glands, which &s;eparate honey, wax, re&s;in, and other juices from their blood; vegetable life &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s an organ of &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h the variations of heat, another to di&s;tingui&s;h the varying degrees of moi&s;ture, another of light, another of touch, and probably another analogous to our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell. To the&s;e mu&s;t be added the indubitable evidence of their pa&s;&s;ion of love, and I think we may truly conclude, that they are furni&s;hed with a common &s;en|&s;orium belonging to each bud, and that they mu&s;t occa&s;ionally repeat tho&s;e perceptions either in their dreams or waking hours, and con&s;e|quently po&s;&s;e&s;s ideas of &s;o many of the properties of the external world, and of their own exi&s;tence.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. PHILOSOPHERS have been much perplexed to under&s;tand, in what manner we become acquainted with the external world; in&s;o|much that Dr. Berkly even doubted its exi&s;tence, from having ob|&s;erved (as he thought) that none of our ideas re&s;emble their cor|re&s;pondent objects. Mr. Hume a&s;&s;erts, that our belief depends on the greater di&s;tinctne&s;s or energy of our ideas from perception; and Mr. Reid has lately contended, that our belief of external objects is an in|nate principle nece&s;&s;arily joined with our perceptions.</P>
<P>So true is the ob&s;ervation of the famous Malbranch, "that our &s;en&s;es are not given us to di&s;cover the e&s;&s;ences of things, but to ac|quaint us with the means of pre&s;erving our exi&s;tence," (L. I. ch. v.) a melancholy reflection to philo&s;ophers!</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers have divided all created beings into material and
<PB N="109" REF="123">
immaterial: the former including all that part of being, which obeys the mechanic laws of action and reaction, but which can begin no motion of it&s;elf; the other is the cau&s;e of all motion, and is either termed the power of gravity, or of &s;pecific attraction, or the &s;pirit of animation. This immaterial agent is &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in or with matter, but to be quite di&s;tinct from it, and to be equally capable of exi&s;tence, after the matter, which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, is decompo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor is this theory ill &s;upported by analogy, &s;ince heat, electricity, and magneti&s;m, can be given to or taken from a piece of iron; and mu&s;t therefore exi&s;t, whether &s;eparated from the metal, or combined with it. From a parity of rea&s;oning, the &s;pirit of animation would appear to be capable of exi&s;ting as well &s;eparately from the body as with it.</P>
<P>I beg to be under&s;tood, that I do not wi&s;h to di&s;pute about words, and am ready to allow, that the powers of gravity, &s;pecific attraction, electricity, magneti&s;m, and even the &s;pirit of animation, may con&s;i&s;t of matter of a finer kind; and to believe, with St. Paul and Mal|branch, that the ultimate cau&s;e only of all motion is immaterial, that is God. St. Paul &s;ays, "in him we live and move, and have our being;" and, in the 15th chapter to the Corinthians, di&s;tingui&s;hes between the p&s;yche or living &s;pirit, and the pneuma or reviving &s;pirit. By the words &s;pirit of animation or &s;en&s;orial power, I mean only that animal life, which mankind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with brutes, and in &s;ome degree even with vegetables, and leave the con&s;ideration of the immortal part of us, which is the object of religion, to tho&s;e who treat of revelation.</P>

<HEAD>II. 1. Of the Sen&s;e of touch.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ideas we become acquainted with, are tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;e of touch; for the foetus mu&s;t experience &s;ome varieties of agi|tation,
<PB N="110" REF="124">
and exert &s;ome mu&s;cular action, in the womb; and may with great probability be &s;uppo&s;ed thus to gain &s;ome ideas of its own figure, of that of the uterus, and of the tenacity of the fluid, that &s;urrounds it, (as appears from the facts mentioned in the &s;ucceeding Section upon In&s;tinct.)</P>
<P>Many of the organs of &s;en&s;e are confined to a &s;mall part of the body, as the no&s;trils, ear, or eye, whil&s;t the &s;en&s;e of touch is dif|fu&s;ed over the whole &s;kin, but exi&s;ts with a more exqui&s;ite degree of delicacy at the extremities of the fingers and thumbs, and in the lips. The &s;en&s;e of touch is thus very commodiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed for the pur|po&s;e of encompa&s;&s;ing &s;maller bodies, and for adapting it&s;elf to the in|equalities of larger ones. The figure of &s;mall bodies &s;eems to be learnt by children by their lips as much as by their fingers; on which account they put every new object to their mouths, when they are &s;atiated with food, as well as when they are hungry. And puppies &s;eem to learn their ideas of figure principally by the lips in their mode of play.</P>
<P>We acquire our tangible ideas of objects either by the &s;imple pre&s;|&s;ure of this organ of touch again&s;t a &s;olid body, or by moving our organ of touch along the &s;urface of it. In the former ca&s;e we learn the length and breadth of the object by the quantity of our organ of touch, that is impre&s;&s;ed by it: in the latter ca&s;e we learn the length and breadth of objects by the continuance of their pre&s;&s;ure on our moving organ of touch.</P>
<P>It is hence, that we are very &s;low in acquiring our tangible ideas, and very &s;low in recollecting them; for if I now think of the tangible idea of a cube, that is, if I think of its figure, and of the &s;olidity of every part of that figure, I mu&s;t conceive my&s;elf as pa&s;&s;ing my fingers over it, and &s;eem in &s;ome mea&s;ure to feel the idea, as I formerly did the impre&s;&s;ion, at the ends of them, and am thus very &s;low in di&s;|tinctly recollecting it.</P>
<P>When a body compre&s;&s;es any part of our &s;en&s;e of touch, what hap|pens?
<PB N="111" REF="125">
Fir&s;t, this part of our &s;en&s;orium undergoes a mechanical compre&s;&s;ion, which is termed a &s;timulus; &s;econdly, an idea, or con|traction of a part of the organ of &s;en&s;e is excited; thirdly, a motion of the central parts, or of the whole &s;en&s;orium, which is termed &s;en|&s;ation, is produced; and the&s;e three con&s;titute the perception of &s;olidity.</P>

<HEAD>2. Of Figure, Motion, Time, Place, Space, Number.</HEAD>
<P>No one will deny, that the medulla of the brain and nerves has a certain figure; which, as it is diffu&s;ed through nearly the whole of the body, mu&s;t have nearly the figure of that body. Now it follows, that the &s;pirit of animation, or living principle, as it occupies this me|dulla, and no other part, (which is evinced by a great variety of cruel experiments on living animals,) it follows, that this &s;pirit of anima|tion has al&s;o the &s;ame figure as the medulla above de&s;cribed. I ap|peal to common &s;en&s;e! the &s;pirit of animation acts, Where does it act? It acts wherever there is the medulla above mentioned; and that whether the limb is yet joined to a living animal, or whether it be recently detached from it; as the heart of a viper or frog will re|new its contractions, when pricked with a pin, for many minutes of time after its ex&s;ection from the body.&mdash;Does it act any where el&s;e?&mdash;No; then it certainly exi&s;ts in this part of &s;pace, and no where el&s;e; that is, it hath figure; namely, the figure of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which is nearly the figure of the body. When the idea of &s;olidity is excited, as above explained, a part of the exten&s;ive organ of touch is compre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome external body, and this part of the &s;en|&s;orium &s;o compre&s;&s;ed exactly re&s;embles <HI>in figure</HI> the figure of the body that compre&s;&s;ed it. Hence, when we acquire the idea of &s;oli|dity,
<PB N="112" REF="126">
we acquire at the &s;ame time the idea of FIGURE; and this idea of figure, or motion of <HI>a part</HI> of the organ of touch, exactly re&s;em|bles <HI>in its figure</HI> the figure of the body that occa&s;ions it; and thus exactly acquaints us with this property of the external world.</P>
<P>Now, as the whole univer&s;e with all its parts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a certain form or figure, if any part of it moves, that form or figure of the whole is varied: hence, as MOTION is no other than a perpetual vari|ation of figure, our idea of motion is al&s;o a real re&s;emblance of the motion that produced it.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid in objection to this definition of motion, that an ivory globe may revolve on its axis, and that here will be a motion without change of figure. But the figure of the particle <HI>x</HI> on one &s;ide of this globe is not the <HI>&s;ame</HI> figure as the figure of <HI>y</HI> on the other &s;ide, any more than the particles them&s;elves are the &s;ame, though they are <HI>&s;imilar</HI> figures; and hence they cannot change place with each other without di&s;turbing or changing the figure of the whole.</P>
<P>Our idea of TIME is from the &s;ame &s;ource, but is more ab&s;tracted, as it includes only the comparative velocities of the&s;e variations of figure; hence if it be a&s;ked, How long was this book in print|ing? it may be an&s;wered, Whil&s;t the &s;un was pa&s;&s;ing through Aries.</P>
<P>Our idea of PLACE includes only the figure of a group of bodies, not the figures of the bodies them&s;elves. If it be a&s;ked where is Not|tingham&s;hire, the an&s;wer is, it is &s;urrounded by Derby&s;hire, Lincoln|&s;hire, and Leice&s;ter&s;hire; hence place is our idea of the figure of one body &s;urrounded by the figures of other bodies.</P>
<P>The idea of SPACE is a more ab&s;tracted idea of place excluding the group of bodies.</P>
<P>The idea of NUMBER includes only the particular arrangements, or di&s;tributions of a group of bodies, and is therefore only a more ab|&s;tracted
<PB N="113" REF="127">
idea of the parts of the figure of the group of bodies; thus when I &s;ay England is divided into forty counties, I only &s;peak of certain divi&s;ions of its figure.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es the certainty of the mathematical &s;ciences, as they ex|plain the&s;e properties of bodies, which are exactly re&s;embled by our ideas of them, whil&s;t we are obliged to collect almo&s;t all our other knowledge from experiment; that is, by ob&s;erving the effects exerted by one body upon another.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="sub-subsection">
<HEAD>3. Of the Penetrability of Matter.</HEAD>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of two bodies exi&s;ting together in the &s;ame &s;pace cannot be deduced from our idea of &s;olidity, or of figure. As &s;oon as we perceive the motions of objects that &s;urround us, and learn that we po&s;&s;e&s;s a power to move our own bodies, we experience, that tho&s;e objects, which excite in us the idea of &s;olidity and of figure, op|po&s;e this voluntary movement of our own organs; as whil&s;t I endea|vour to compre&s;s between my hands an ivory ball into a &s;pheroid. And we are hence taught by experience, that our own body and tho&s;e, which we touch, cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame part of &s;pace.</P>
<P>But this by no means demon&s;trates, that no two bodies can exi&s;t together in the &s;ame part of &s;pace. Galilaeo in the preface to his works &s;eems to be of opinion, that matter is not impenetrable; Mr. Michel, and Mr. Bo&s;cowich in his Theoria. Philo&s;. Natur. have e&s;pou&s;ed this hypothe&s;is: which has been lately publi&s;hed by Dr. Prie&s;tley, to whom the world is much indebted for &s;o many impor|tant di&s;coveries in &s;cience. (Hi&s;t. of Light and Colours, p. 391.) The uninterrupted pa&s;&s;age of light through tran&s;parent bodies, of the elec|tric aether through metallic and aqueous bodies, and of the magnetic effluvia through all bodies, would &s;eem to give &s;ome probability to this
<PB N="114" REF="128">
opinion. Hence it appears, that beings may exi&s;t without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the property of &s;olidity, as well as they can exi&s;t without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the properties, which excite our &s;mell or ta&s;te, and can thence occupy &s;pace without detruding other bodies from it; but we cannot be|come acquainted with &s;uch beings by our &s;en&s;e of touch, any more than we can with odours or flavours without our &s;en&s;es of &s;mell and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But that any being can exi&s;t without exi&s;ting in &s;pace, is to my ideas utterly incomprehen&s;ible. My appeal is to common &s;en&s;e. <HI>To be</HI> implies a when and a where; the one is comparing it with the mo|tions of other beings, and the other with their &s;ituations.</P>
<P>If there was but one object, as the whole creation may be con&s;ider|ed as one object, then I cannot a&s;k where it exi&s;ts? for there are no other objects to compare its &s;ituation with. Hence if any one denies, that a being exi&s;ts in &s;pace, he denies, that there are any other beings but that one; for to an&s;wer the que&s;tion, "Where does it exi&s;t?" is only to mention the &s;ituation of the objects that &s;ur|round it.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner if it be a&s;ked&mdash;"When does a being exi&s;t?" The an&s;wer only &s;pecifies the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions either of it&s;elf, or of other bodies; hence to &s;ay, a body exi&s;ts not in time, is to &s;ay, that there is, or was, no motion in the world.</P>

<HEAD>4. Of the Spirit of Animation.</HEAD>
<P>But though there may exi&s;t beings in the univer&s;e, that have not the property of &s;olidity; that is, which can po&s;&s;e&s;s any part of &s;pace, at the &s;ame time that it is occupied by other bodies; yet there may be other beings, that can a&s;&s;ume this property of &s;olidity, or di&s;robe them&s;elves of it occa&s;ionally, as we are taught of &s;pirits, and of an|gels;
<PB N="115" REF="129">
and it would &s;eem, that THE SPIRIT OF ANIMATION mu&s;t be endued with this property, otherwi&s;e how could it occa&s;ionally give motion to the limbs of animals?&mdash;or be it&s;elf &s;timulated into motion by the obtru&s;ions of &s;urrounding bodies, as of light, or odour?</P>
<P>If the &s;pirit of animation was always nece&s;&s;arily penetrable, it could not influence or be influenced by the &s;olidity of common matter; they would exi&s;t together, but could not detrude each other from the part of &s;pace, where they exi&s;t; that is, they could not communicate mo|tion to each other. <HI>No two things can influence or affect each other, which have not &s;ome property common to both of them</HI>; for to influence or affect another body is to give or communicate &s;ome property to it, that it had not before; but how can one body give that to another, which it does not po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf?&mdash;The words imply, that they mu&s;t agree in having the power or faculty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome common pro|perty. Thus if one body removes another from the part of &s;pace, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it mu&s;t have the power of occupying that &s;pace it&s;elf: and if one body communicates heat or motion to another, it follows, that they have alike the property of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing heat or motion.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;pirit of animation at the time it communicates or re|ceives motion from &s;olid bodies, mu&s;t it&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome property of &s;olidity. And in con&s;equence at the time it receives other kinds of motion from light, it mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s that property, which light po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, to communicate that kind of motion; and for which no lan|guage has a name, unle&s;s it may be termed Vi&s;ibility. And at the time it is &s;timulated into other kinds of animal motion by the particles of &s;apid and odorous bodies affecting the &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and &s;mell, it mu&s;t re&s;emble the&s;e particles of flavour, and of odour, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;imilar or corre&s;pondent property; and for which language has no name, unle&s;s we may u&s;e the words Saporo&s;ity and Odoro&s;ity for tho&s;e common properties, which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our organs of ta&s;te and &s;mell, and by the particles of &s;apid and odorous bodies; as the

<P>5. Finally, though the figures of bodies are in truth re&s;embled by the figure of the part of the organ of touch, which is &s;timulated into motion; and that organ re&s;embles the &s;olid body, which &s;timulates it, in its property of &s;olidity; and though the &s;en&s;e of hearing re|&s;embles the vibrations of external bodies in its capability of being &s;ti|mulated into motion by tho&s;e vibrations; and though our other organs of &s;en&s;e re&s;emble the bodies, that &s;timulate them, in their ca|pability of being &s;timulated by them; and we hence become ac|quainted with the&s;e properties of the external world; yet as we can repeat all the&s;e motions of our organs of &s;en&s;e by the efforts of voli|tion, or in con&s;equence of the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain, or by their a&s;&s;ociation with other fibrous motions, as happens in our reveries or in &s;leep, there would &s;till appear to be &s;ome difficulty in demon&s;trating the exi&s;tence of any thing external to us.</P>
<P>In our dreams we cannot determine this circum&s;tance, becau&s;e our power of volition is &s;u&s;pended, and the &s;timuli of external objects are excluded; but in our waking hours we can compare our ideas belonging to one &s;en&s;e with tho&s;e belonging to another, and can thus di&s;tingui&s;h the ideas occa&s;ioned by irritation from tho&s;e excited by &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation. Thus if the idea of the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ugar &s;hould be excited in our dreams, the whitene&s;s and hardne&s;s of it occur at the &s;ame time by a&s;&s;ociation; and we believe a material lump of &s;ugar pre&s;ent before us. But if, in our waking hours, the idea of the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ugar occurs to us, the &s;timuli of &s;urround|ing objects, as the edge of the table, on which we pre&s;s, or green colour of the gra&s;s, on which we tread, prevent the other ideas of the hardne&s;s and whitene&s;s of the &s;ugar from being exerted by a&s;&s;oci|ation. Or if they &s;hould occur, we voluntarily compare them with the irritative ideas of the table or gra&s;s above mentioned, and detect
<PB N="117" REF="131">
their fallacy. We can thus di&s;tingui&s;h the ideas cau&s;ed by the &s;timuli of external objects from tho&s;e, which are introduced by a&s;&s;ociation, &s;en&s;ation, or volition; and during our waking hours can thus acquire a knowledge of the external world. Which neverthele&s;s we cannot do in our dreams, becau&s;e we have neither perceptions of external bodies, nor the power of volition to enable us to compare them with the ideas of imagination.</P>

<HEAD>III. Of Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>OUR eyes ob&s;erve a difference of colour, or of &s;hade, in the pro|minences and depre&s;&s;ions of objects, and that tho&s;e &s;hades uniformly vary, when the &s;en&s;e of touch ob&s;erves any variation. Hence when the retina becomes &s;timulated by colours or &s;hades of light in a certain form, as in a circular &s;pot; we know by experience, that this is a &s;ign, that a tangible body is before us; and that its figure is re&s;embled by the miniature figure of the part of the organ of vi&s;ion, that is thus &s;timulated.</P>
<P>Here whil&s;t the &s;timulated part of the retina re&s;embles exactly the vi&s;ible figure of the whole in miniature, the various kinds of &s;timuli from different colours mark the vi&s;ible figures of the minuter parts; and by habit we in&s;tantly recall the tangible figures.</P>
<P>Thus when a tree is the object of &s;ight, a part of the retina re|&s;embling a flat branching figure is &s;timulated by various &s;hades of co|lours; but it is by &s;ugge&s;tion, that the gibbo&s;ity of the tree, and the mo&s;s, that fringes its trunk, appear before us. The&s;e are ideas of &s;ug|ge&s;tion, which we feel or attend to, a&s;&s;ociated with the motions of the retina, or irritative ideas, which we do not attend to.</P>
<P>So that though our vi&s;ible ideas re&s;emble in miniature the outline of the figure of coloured bodies, in other re&s;pects they &s;erve only as
<PB N="118" REF="132">
a language, which by acquired a&s;&s;ociations introduce the tangible ideas of bodies. Hence it is, that this &s;en&s;e is &s;o readily deceived by the art of the painter to our amu&s;ement and in&s;truction. The reader will find much very curious knowledge on this &s;ubject in Bi&s;hop Berk|ley's E&s;&s;ay on Vi&s;ion, a work of great ingenuity.</P>
<P>The immediate object however of the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion is light; this fluid, though its velocity is &s;o great, appears to have no perceptible mechanical impul&s;e, as was mentioned in the third Section, but &s;eems to &s;timulate the retina into animal motion by its tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, through this part of the &s;en&s;orium: for though the eyes of cats or other animals appear luminous in ob&s;cure places; yet it is probable, that none of the light, which falls on the retina, is reflected from it, but adheres to or enters into combination with the choroide coat be|hind it.</P>
<P>The combination of the particles of light with opake bodies, and therefore with the choroide coat of the eye, is evinced from the heat, which is given out, as in other chemical combinations. For the &s;un|beams communicate no heat in their pa&s;&s;age through tran&s;parent bodies, with which they do not combine, as the air continues cool even in the focus of the large&s;t burning-gla&s;&s;es, which in a moment vitrifies a particle of opaque matter.</P>

<HEAD>IV. Of the Organ of Hearing.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally believed, that the tympanum of the ear vibrates mechanically, when expo&s;ed to audible &s;ounds, like the &s;trings of one mu&s;ical in&s;trument, when the &s;ame notes are &s;truck upon another. Nor is this opinion improbable, as the mu&s;cles and cartilages of the larynx are employed in producing variety of tones by mechanical vi|bration: &s;o the mu&s;cles and bones of the ear &s;eem adapted to increa&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="133">
or dimini&s;h the ten&s;ion of the tympanum for the purpo&s;es of &s;imilar mechanical vibrations.</P>
<P>But it appears from di&s;&s;ection, that the tympanum is not the im|mediate organ of hearing, but that like the humours and cornea of the eye, it is only of u&s;e to prepare the object for the immediate organ. For the portio mollis of the auditory nerve is not &s;pread upon the tympanum, but upon the ve&s;tibulum, and cochlea, and &s;emicircular canals of the ear; while between the tympanum and the expan&s;ion of the auditory nerve the cavity is &s;aid by Dr. Cotunnus and Dr. Meckel to be filled with water; as they had frequently ob&s;erved by freezing the heads of dead animals before they di&s;&s;ected them; and water being a more den&s;e fluid than air is much better adapted to the pro|pagation of vibrations. We may add, that even the external opening of the ear is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the perception of &s;ound: for &s;ome people, who from the&s;e defects would have been completely deaf, have di&s;tingui&s;hed acute or grave &s;ounds by the tremours of a &s;tick held between their teeth propagated along the bones of the head, (Haller. Phy&s;. T. V. p. 295.)</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that the immediate organ of hearing is not affected by the particles of the air them&s;elves, but is &s;timulated into animal motion by the vibrations of them. And it is probable from the loo&s;e bones, which are found in the heads of &s;ome fi&s;hes, that the vibra|tions of water are &s;en&s;ible to the inhabitants of that element by a &s;imilar organ.</P>
<P>The motions of the atmo&s;phere, which we become acquainted with by the &s;en&s;e of touch, are combined with its &s;olidity, weight, or vis inertiae; whereas tho&s;e, that are perceived by this organ, depend alone on its ela&s;ticity. But though the vibration of the air is the immediate object of the &s;en&s;e of hearing, yet the ideas, we receive by this &s;en&s;e, like tho&s;e received from light, are only as a language, which by ac|quired a&s;&s;ociations acquaints us with tho&s;e motions of tangible bodies,

<HEAD>VI. Of the Sen&s;e of Heat.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many experiments in chemical writers, that evince the exi&s;tence of heat as a fluid element, which covers and pervades all bodies, and is attracted by the &s;olutions of &s;ome of them, and is de|truded from the combination of others. Thus from the combinations of metals with acids, and from tho&s;e combinations of animal fluids,
<PB N="121" REF="135">
which are termed &s;ecretions, this fluid matter of heat is given out among&s;t the neighbouring bodies; and in the &s;olutions of &s;alts in wa|ter, or of water in air, it is ab&s;orbed from the bodies, that &s;urround them; whil&s;t in its facility in pa&s;&s;ing through metallic bodies, and its difficulty in pervading re&s;ins and gla&s;s, it re&s;embles the properties of the electric aura; and is like that excited by friction, and &s;eems like that to gravitate among&s;t other bodies in its uncombined &s;tate, and to find its equilibrium.</P>
<P>There is no circum&s;tance of more con&s;equence in the animal eco|nomy than a due proportion of this fluid of heat; for the dige&s;tion of our nutriment in the &s;tomach and bowels, and the proper qualities of all our &s;ecreted fluids, as they are produced or prepared partly by animal and partly by chemical proce&s;&s;es, depend much on the quantity of heat; the exce&s;s of which, or its deficiency, alike gives us pain, and induces us to avoid the circum&s;tances that occa&s;ion them. And in this the perception of heat e&s;&s;entially differs from the perceptions of the &s;en&s;e of touch, as we receive pain from too great pre&s;&s;ure of &s;olid bodies, but none from the ab&s;ence of it. It is hence probable, that nature has provided us with a &s;et of nerves for the perception of this fluid, which anatomi&s;ts have not yet attended to.</P>
<P>There may be &s;ome difficulty in the proof of this a&s;&s;ertion; if we look at a hot fire, we experience no pain of the optic nerve, though the heat along with the light mu&s;t be concentrated upon it. Nor does warm water or warm oil poured into the ear give pain to the organ of hearing; and hence as the&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e do not perceive &s;mall exce&s;&s;es or deficiences of heat; and as heat has no greater ana|logy to the &s;olidity or to the figures of bodies, than it has to their colours or vibrations; there &s;eems no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our a&s;crib|ing the perception of heat and cold to the &s;en&s;e of touch; to which it has generally been attributed, either becau&s;e it is diffu&s;ed beneath the whole &s;kin like the &s;en&s;e of touch, or owing to the inaccuracy of our ob&s;ervations, or the de&s;ect of our languages.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="136">
There is another circum&s;tance would induce us to believe, that the perceptions of heat and cold do not belong to the organ of touch; &s;ince the teeth, which are the lea&s;t adapted for the perceptions of &s;o|lidity or figure, are the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to heat or cold; whence we are forewarned from &s;wallowing tho&s;e materials, who&s;e degree of coldne&s;s or of heat would injure our &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>The following is an extract from a letter of Dr. R. W. Darwin, of Shrew&s;bury, when he was a &s;tudent at Edinburgh. "I made an experiment ye&s;terday in our ho&s;pital, which much favours your opi|nion, that the &s;en&s;ation of heat and of touch depend on different &s;ets of nerves. A man who had lately recovered from a fever, and was &s;till weak, was &s;eized with violent cramps in his legs and feet; which were removed by opiates, except that one of his feet remained in&s;en|&s;ible. Mr. Ewart pricked him with a pin in five or &s;ix places, and the patient declared he did not feel it in the lea&s;t, nor was he &s;en&s;ible of a very &s;mart pinch. I then held a red-hot poker at &s;ome di&s;tance, and brought it gradually nearer till it came within three inches, when he a&s;&s;erted that he felt it quite di&s;tinctly. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome violent ir|ritation on the nerves of touch had cau&s;ed the cramps, and had left them paralytic; while the nerves of heat, having &s;uffered no increa&s;ed &s;timulus, retained their irritability."</P>

<HEAD>VII. Of the Sen&s;e of Exten&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE organ of touch is properly the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;&s;ure, but the mu&s;|cular fibres them&s;elves con&s;titute the organ of &s;en&s;e, that feels ex|ten&s;ion. The &s;en&s;e of pre&s;&s;ure is always attended with the ideas of the figure and &s;olidity of the object, neither of which accompany our perception of exten&s;ion. The whole &s;et of mu&s;cles, whether they are hollow ones, as the heart, arteries, and inte&s;tines, or longitudinal
<PB N="123" REF="137">
ones attached to bones, contract them&s;elves, whenever they are &s;ti|mulated by forcible elongation; and it is ob&s;ervable, that the white mu&s;cles, which con&s;titute the arterial &s;y&s;tem, &s;eem to be excited into contraction from no other kinds of &s;timulus, according to the experiments of Haller. And hence the violent pain in &s;ome inflam|mations, as in the paronychia, obtains immediate relief by cutting the membrane, that was &s;tretched by the tumour of the &s;ubjacent parts.</P>
<P>Hence the whole mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem may be con&s;idered as one organ of &s;en&s;e, and the various attitudes of the body, as ideas belonging to this organ, of many of which we are hourly con&s;cious, while many others, like the irritative ideas of the other &s;en&s;es, are performed with|out our attention.</P>
<P>When the mu&s;cles of the heart cea&s;e to act, the refluent blood again di&s;tends or elongates them; and thus irritated they contract as before. The &s;ame happens to the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and I &s;uppo&s;e to the capillaries, inte&s;tines, and various glands of the body.</P>
<P>When the quantity of urine, or of excrement, di&s;tends the bladder, or rectum, tho&s;e parts contract, and exclude their contents, and many other mu&s;cles by a&s;&s;ociation act along with them; but if the&s;e evacuations are not &s;oon complied with, pain is produced by a little further exten&s;ion of the mu&s;cular fibres: a &s;imilar pain is cau&s;ed in the mu&s;cles, when a limb is much extended for the reduction of di&s;|located bones; and in the puni&s;hment of the rack: and in the pain|ful cramps of the calf of the leg, or of other mu&s;cles, for a greater degree of contraction of a mu&s;cle, than the movement of the two bones, to which its ends are affixed, will admit of, mu&s;t give &s;imi|lar pain to that, which is produced by extending it beyond its due length. And the pain from punctures or inci&s;ions ari&s;es from the di&s;|tention of the fibres, as the knife pa&s;&s;es through them; for it nearly cea&s;es as &s;oon as the divi&s;ion is completed.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="138">
All the&s;e motions of the mu&s;cles, that are thus naturally excited by the &s;timulus of di&s;tending bodies, are al&s;o liable to be called into &s;trong action by their catenation, with the irritations or &s;en&s;ations produced by the momentum of the progre&s;&s;ive particles of blood in the arteries, as in inflammatory fevers, or by acrid &s;ub&s;tances on other &s;en&s;ible organs, as in the &s;trangury, or tene&s;mus, or cholera.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this account of the &s;en&s;e of exten&s;ion by ob&s;erv|ing, that the want of its object is attended with a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion, as well as the exce&s;s of it. In tho&s;e hollow mu&s;cles, which have been accu&s;tomed to it, this di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is called faint|ne&s;s, emptine&s;s, and &s;inking; and, when it ari&s;es to a certain degree, is attended with &s;yncope, or a total quie&s;cence of all motions, but the internal irritative ones, as happens from &s;udden lo&s;s of blood, or in the operation of tapping in the drop&s;y.</P>

<P>HUNGER is mo&s;t probably perceived by tho&s;e numerous ramifica|tions of nerves that are &s;een about the upper opening of the &s;tomach; and thir&s;t by the nerves about the fauces, and the top of the gula. The ideas of the&s;e &s;en&s;es are few in the generality of mankind, but are more numerous in tho&s;e, who by di&s;ea&s;e, or indulgence, de&s;ire particular kinds of foods or liquids.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of heat has already been &s;poken of, which may with pro|priety be called an appetite, as we painfully de&s;ire it, when it is de|ficient in quantity.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of exten&s;ion may be ranked among&s;t the&s;e appetites, &s;ince the deficiency of its object gives di&s;agrecable &s;en&s;ation; when this happens in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, it is called faintne&s;s, and &s;eems to
<PB N="125" REF="139">
bear &s;ome analogy to hunger and to cold; which like it are attended with emptine&s;s of a part of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of want of fre&s;h air has not been attended to, but is as di&s;tinct as the others, and the fir&s;t perhaps that we experience after our nativity; from the want of the object of this &s;en&s;e many di&s;ea&s;es are produced, as the jail-fever, plague, and other epidemic maladies. Animal love is another appetite, which occurs later in life, and the females of lactiferous animals have another natural inlet of plea&s;ure or pain from the &s;uckling their offspring. The want of which either owing to the death of their progeny, or to the fa&s;hion of their country, has been fatal to many of the &s;ex. The males have al&s;o pectoral glands, which are frequently turgid with a thin milk at their nativity, and are furni&s;hed with nipples, which erect on titilla|tion like tho&s;e of the female; but which &s;eem now to be of no fur|ther u&s;e, owing perhaps to &s;ome change which the&s;e animals have undergone in the gradual progre&s;&s;ion of the formation of the earth, and of all that it inhabit.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;even la&s;t mentioned &s;en&s;es may properly be termed appetites, as they differ from tho&s;e of touch, &s;ight, hearing, ta&s;te, and &s;mell, in this re&s;pect; that they are affected with pain as well by the defect of their objects as by the exce&s;s of them, which is not &s;o in the latter. Thus cold and hunger give us pain, as well as an exce&s;s of heat or &s;atiety; but it is not &s;o with darkne&s;s and &s;ilence.</P>

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="subsection">
<P>IX. Before we conclude this Section on the organs of &s;en&s;e, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, as far as we know, there are many more &s;en&s;es, than have been here mentioned, as every gland &s;eems to be influenced to &s;eparate from the blood, or to ab&s;orb from the cavities of the body, or from the atmo&s;phere, its appropriated fluid, by the &s;timulus of that fluid on the living gland; and not by mechanical capillary ab|&s;orption, nor by chemical affinity. Hence it appears, that each of
<PB N="126" REF="140">
the&s;e glands mu&s;t have a peculiar organ to perceive the&s;e irritations, but as the&s;e irritations are not &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation, they have not acquired the names of &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>However when the&s;e glands are excited into motions &s;tronger than u&s;ual, either by the acrimony of their fluids, or by their own irrita|bility being much increa&s;ed, then the &s;en&s;ation of pain is produced in them as in all the other &s;en&s;es of the body; and the&s;e pains are all of different kinds, and hence the glands at this time really become each a different organ of &s;en&s;e, though the&s;e different kinds of pain have acquired no names.</P>
<P>Thus a great exce&s;s of light does not give the idea of light but of pain; as in forcibly opening the eye when it is much inflamed. The great exce&s;s of pre&s;&s;ure or di&s;tention, as when the point of a pin is pre&s;&s;ed upon our &s;kin, produces pain, (and when this pain of the &s;en&s;e of touch is &s;lighter, it is termed itching, or tickling,) without any idea of &s;olidity or of figure: an exce&s;s of heat produces &s;marting, of cold another kind of pain; it is probable by this &s;en&s;e of heat the pain produced by cau&s;tic bodies is perceived, and of electricity, as all the&s;e are fluids, that permeate, di&s;tend, or decompo&s;e the parts that feel them.</P>

<P N="1">I. AS the con&s;tituent elements of the material world are only per|ceptible to our organs of &s;en&s;e in a &s;tate of combination; it follows, that the ideas or &s;en&s;ual motions excited by them, are never received &s;ingly, but ever with a greater or le&s;s degree of combination. So the colours of bodies or their hardne&s;&s;es occur with their figures: every &s;mell and ta&s;te has its degree of pungency as well as its peculiar fla|vour: and each note in mu&s;ic is combined with the tone of &s;ome in|&s;trument. It appears from hence, that we can be &s;en&s;ible of a num|ber of ideas at the &s;ame time, &s;uch as the whitene&s;s, hardne&s;s, and coldne&s;s, of a &s;now-ball, and can experience at the &s;ame time many irritative ideas of &s;urrounding bodies, which we do not attend to, as mentioned in Section VII. 3. 2.

Tho&s;e ideas, which we repeat without change of the quantity of that combination, with which we fir&s;t received them, are called complex ideas, as when you recollect We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, or the planet Saturn: but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e complex ideas, thus re-excited by volition, &s;en&s;ation, or a&s;&s;ociation, are &s;eldom per|fect copies of their corre&s;pondent perceptions, except in our dreams, where other external objects do not detract our attention.</P>
<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e ideas, which are more complex than the natural objects that fir&s;t excited them, have been called compounded ideas, as when we think of a &s;phinx, or griffin.</P>
<P N="5">5. And tho&s;e that are le&s;s complex than the corre&s;pondent natural objects, have been termed ab&s;tracted ideas: thus &s;weetne&s;s, and white|ne&s;s, and &s;olidity, are received at the &s;ame time from a lump of &s;ugar, yet I can recollect any of the&s;e qualities without thinking of the others, that were excited along with them.</P>
<P>When ideas are &s;o far ab&s;tracted as in the above example, they have been termed &s;imple by the writers of metaphy&s;ics, and &s;eem indeed to be more complete repetitions of the ideas or &s;en&s;ual motions, originally excited by external objects.</P>
<P>Other cla&s;&s;es of the&s;e ideas, where the ab&s;traction has not been &s;o great, have been termed, by Mr. Locke, modes, &s;ub&s;tances, and re|lations,
<PB N="129" REF="143">
but they &s;eem only to differ in their degree of ab&s;traction from the complex ideas that were at fir&s;t excited; for as the&s;e complex or natural ideas are them&s;elves imperfect copies of their corre&s;pondent perceptions, &s;o the&s;e ab&s;tract or general ideas are only &s;till more im|perfect copies of the &s;ame perceptions. Thus when I have &s;een an object but once, as a rhinoceros, my ab&s;tract idea of this animal is the fame as my complex one. I may think more or le&s;s di&s;tinctly of a rhinoceros, but it is the very rhinoceros that I &s;aw, or &s;ome part or property of him, which recurs to my mind.</P>
<P>But when any cla&s;s of complex objects becomes the &s;ubject of con|ver&s;ation, of which I have &s;een many individuals, as a ca&s;tle or an army, &s;ome property or circum&s;tance belonging to it is peculiarly al|luded to; and then I feel in my own mind, that my ab&s;tract idea of this complex object is only an idea of that part, property, or attitude of it, that employs the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, and varies with every &s;entence that is &s;poken concerning it. So if any one &s;hould &s;ay, "one may &s;it upon a hor&s;e &s;afer than on a camel," my ab&s;tract idea of the two animals includes only an outline of the level back of the one, and the gibbo&s;ity on the back of the other. What noi&s;e is that in the &s;treet?&mdash;Some hor&s;es trotting over the pavement. Here my idea of the hor&s;es includes principally the &s;hape and motion of their legs. So al&s;o the ab&s;tract ideas of goodne&s;s and courage are &s;till more imperfect repre&s;entations of the objects they were received from; for here we ab&s;tract the material parts, and recollect only the qualities.</P>
<P>Thus we ab&s;tract &s;o much from &s;ome of our complex ideas, that at length it becomes difficult to determine of what perception they partake; and in many in&s;tances our idea &s;eems to be no other than of the &s;ound or letters of the word, that &s;tands for the collective tribe, of which we are &s;aid to have an ab&s;tracted idea, as noun, verb, chi|maera, apparition.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="130" REF="144">
6. Ideas have been divided into tho&s;e of perception and tho&s;e of reflection, but as whatever is perceived mu&s;t be external to the organ that perceives it, all our ideas mu&s;t originally be ideas of per|ception.</P>
<P N="7">7. Others have divided our ideas into tho&s;e of memory, and tho&s;e of imagination; they have &s;aid that a recollection of ideas in the order they were received con&s;titutes memory, and without that order ima|gination; but all the ideas of imagination, excepting the few that are termed &s;imple ideas, are parts of trains or tribes in the order they were received: as if I think of a &s;phinx, or a griffin, the fair face, bo&s;om, wings, claws, tail, are all complex ideas in the order they were received: and it behoves the writers, who adhere to this de|finition, to determine, how &s;mall the trains mu&s;t be, that &s;hall be called imagination; and how great tho&s;e, that &s;hall be called memory.</P>
<P>Others have thought that the ideas of memory have a greater viva|city than tho&s;e of imagination: but the ideas of a per&s;on in &s;leep, or in a waking reverie, where the trains connected with &s;en&s;ation are un|interrupted, are more vivid and di&s;tinct than tho&s;e of memory, &s;o that they cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed by this criterion.</P>
<P>The very ingenious author of the Elements of Critici&s;m has de|&s;cribed what he conceives to be a &s;pecies of memory, and calls it ideal pre&s;ence; but the in&s;tances he produces are the reveries of &s;en&s;ation, and are therefore in truth connections of the imagination, though they are recalled in the order they were received.</P>
<P>The ideas connected by a&s;&s;ociation are in common di&s;cour&s;e attri|buted to memory, as we talk of memorandum-rings, and tie a knot on our handkerchiefs to bring &s;omething into our minds at a di&s;tance of time. And a &s;chool-boy, who can repeat a thou&s;and unmeaning lines in Lilly's Grammar, is &s;aid to have a good memory. But the&s;e have been already &s;hewn to belong to the cla&s;s of a&s;&s;ociation; and are termed ideas of &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>

<P>II. La&s;tly, the method already explained of cla&s;&s;ing ideas into tho&s;e excited by irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, or a&s;&s;ociation, we hope will be found more convenient both for explaining the operations of the mind, and for comparing them with tho&s;e of the body; and for the illu&s;tration and the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es of both, and which we &s;hall here recapitulate.</P>
<P N="1">1. Irritative ideas are tho&s;e, which are preceded by irritation, which is excited by objects external to the organs of &s;en&s;e: as the idea of that tree, which either I attend to, or which I &s;hun in walking near it without attention. In the former ca&s;e it is termed perception, in the latter it is termed &s;imply an irritative idea.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sen&s;itive ideas are tho&s;e, which are preceded by the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain; as the ideas, which con&s;titute our dreams or reve|ries, this is called imagination.</P>
<P N="3">3. Voluntary ideas are tho&s;e, which are preceded by voluntary exertion, as when I repeat the alphabet backwards: this is called re|collection.</P>
<P N="4">4. A&s;&s;ociate ideas are tho&s;e, which are preceded by other ideas or mu&s;cular motions, as when we think over or repeat the alphabet by rote in its u&s;ual order; or &s;ing a tune we are accu&s;tomed to; this is called &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">III. 1. Perceptions &s;ignify tho&s;e ideas, which are preceded by ir|ritation and &s;ucceeded by the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain, for what|ever excites our attention intere&s;ts us; that is, it is accompanied with plea&s;ure or pain; however &s;light may be the degree or quantity of either of them.</P>
<P>The word memory includes two cla&s;&s;es of ideas, either tho&s;e which are preceded by voluntary exertion, or tho&s;e which are &s;ugge&s;ted by their a&s;&s;ociations with other ideas.</P>
<P N="2">2. Rea&s;oning is that operation of the &s;en&s;orium, by which we ex|cite two or many tribes of ideas; and then re-excite the ideas, in which they differ, or corre&s;pond. If we determine this difference, it
<PB N="132" REF="146">
is called judgment; if we in vain endeavour to determine it, it is called doubting.</P>
<P>If we re-excited the ideas, in which they differ, it is called di&s;|tingui&s;hing. If we re-excite tho&s;e in which they corre&s;pond, it is called comparing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Invention is an operation of the &s;en&s;orium, by which we volun|tarily continue to excite one train of ideas, &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;ign of rai&s;ing water by a machine; and at the &s;ame time attend to all other ideas, which are connected with this by every kind of catenation; and combine or &s;eparate them voluntarily for the purpo&s;e of obtaining &s;ome end.</P>
<P>For we can create nothing new, we can only combine or &s;eparate the ideas, which we have already received by our perceptions: thus if I wi&s;h to repre&s;ent a mon&s;ter, I call to my mind the ideas of every thing di&s;agreeable and horrible, and combine the na&s;tine&s;s and glut|tony of a hog, the &s;tupidity and ob&s;timacy of an a&s;s, with the fur and awkwardne&s;s of a bear, and call the new combination Caliban. Yet &s;uch a mon&s;ter may exi&s;t in nature, as all his attributes are parts of nature. So when I wi&s;h to repre&s;ent every thing, that is excellent, and amiable; when I combine benevolence with cheerfulne&s;s, wi&s;|dom, knowledge, ta&s;te, wit, beauty of per&s;on, and elegance of manners, and a&s;&s;ociate them in one lady as a pattern to the world, it is called invention; yet &s;uch a per&s;on may exi&s;t,&mdash;&s;uch a per&s;on does exi&s;t!&mdash;It is <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 words">, who is as much a mon&s;ter as Caliban.</P>
<P N="4">4. In re&s;pect to con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, we are only con&s;cious of our ex|i&s;tence, when we think about it; as we only perceive the lap&s;e of time, when we attend to it; when we are bu&s;ied about other objects, neither the lap&s;e of time nor the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own exi&s;tence can occupy our attention. Hence, when we think of our own ex|i&s;tence, we only excite ab&s;tracted or reflex ideas (as they are termed), of our principal plea&s;ures or pains, of our de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, or of the
<PB N="133" REF="147">
figure, &s;olidity, colour, or other properties of our bodies, and call that act of the &s;en&s;orium a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence. Some philo&s;o|phers, I believe it is Des Cartes, has &s;aid, "I think, therefore I exi&s;t." But this is not right rea&s;oning, becau&s;e thinking is a mode of exi&s;tence; and it is thence only &s;aying, "I exi&s;t, therefore I exi&s;t." For there are three modes of exi&s;tence, or in the language of grammarians three kinds of verbs. Fir&s;t, &s;imply I am, or exi&s;t. Secondly, I am acting, or exi&s;t in a &s;tate of activity, as I move. Thirdly, I am &s;uffering, or exi&s;t in a &s;tate of being acted upon, as I am moved. The when, and the where, as applicable to this exi&s;tence, depends on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions of our own or of other bodies; and on their re&s;pective &s;itua|tions, as &s;poken of Sect. XIV. 2. 5.</P>
<P N="5">5. Our identity is known by our acquired habits or catenated trains of ideas and mu&s;cular motions; and perhaps, when we compare in|fancy with old age, in tho&s;e alone can our identity be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t. For what el&s;e is there of &s;imilitude between the fir&s;t &s;peck of living entity and the mature man?&mdash;every deduction of rea&s;oning, every &s;en|timent or pa&s;&s;ion, with every fibre of the corporeal part of our &s;y&s;tem, has been &s;ubject almo&s;t to annual mutation; while &s;ome catenations alone of our ideas and mu&s;cular actions have continued in part un|changed.</P>
<P>By the facility, with which we can in our waking hours voluntarily produce certain &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains of ideas, we know by experience, that we have before reproduced them; that is, we are con&s;cious of a time of our exi&s;tence previous to the pre&s;ent time; that is, of our iden|tity now and heretofore. It is the&s;e habits of action, the&s;e catenations of ideas and mu&s;cular motions, which begin with life, and only ter|minate with it; and which we can in &s;ome mea&s;ure deliver to our po&s;terity; as explained in Sect. XXXIX.</P>
<P N="6">6. When the progre&s;&s;ive motions of external bodies make a part of our pre&s;ent catenation of ideas, we attend to the lap&s;e of time; which appears the longer, the more frequently we thus attend to it; as when
<PB N="134" REF="148">
we expect &s;omething at a certain hour, which much intere&s;ts us, whether it be an agreeable or di&s;agreeable event; or when we count the pa&s;&s;ing &s;econds on a &s;top-watch.</P>
<P>When an idea of our own per&s;on, or a reflex idea of our plea&s;ures and pains, de&s;ires and aver&s;ions, makes a part of this catenation, it is termed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and if this idea of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s makes a part of a catenation, which we excite by recollection, and know by the facility with which we excite it, that we have before experienced it, it is called identity, as explained above.</P>
<P N="7">7. In re&s;pect to freewill, it is certain, that we cannot will to think of a new train of ideas, without previou&s;ly thinking of the fir&s;t link of it; as I cannot will to think of a black &s;wan, without previou&s;ly think|ing of a black &s;wan. But if I now think of a tail, I can voluntarily recollect all animals, which have tails; my will is &s;o far free, that I can pur&s;ue the ideas linked to this idea of tail, as far as my knowledge of the &s;ubject extends; but to will without motive is to will without de&s;ire or aver&s;ion; which is as ab&s;urd as to feel without plea&s;ure or pain; they are both &s;oleci&s;ms in the terms. So far are we governed by the catenations of motions, which affect both the body and the mind of man, and which begin with our irritability, and end with it.</P>

<P>I. ALL tho&s;e internal motions of animal bodies, which contribute to dige&s;t their aliment, produce their &s;ecretions, repair their injuries, or increa&s;e their growth, are performed without our attention or con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="136" REF="150">
They exi&s;t as well in our &s;leep, as in our waking hours, as well in the foetus during the time of ge&s;tation, as in the infant after nativity, and proceed with equal regularity in the vegetable as in the animal &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e motions have been &s;hewn in a former part of this work to depend on the irritations of peculiar fluids, and as they have never been cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the in&s;tinctive actions of animals, are precluded from our pre&s;ent di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>But all tho&s;e actions of men or animals, that are attended with con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eem neither to have been directed by their appetites, taught by their experience, nor deduced from ob&s;ervation or tradition, have been referred to the power of in&s;tinct. And this power has been explained to be a <HI>divine &s;omething,</HI> a kind of in&s;piration; whil&s;t the poor animal, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, has been thought little better than <HI>a machine!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>irk&s;omene&s;s,</HI> that attends a continued attitude of the body, or the <HI>pains,</HI> that we receive from heat, cold, hunger, or other injuri|ous circum&s;tances, excite us to <HI>general locomotion:</HI> and our &s;en&s;es are &s;o formed and con&s;tituted by the hand of nature, that certain objects pre&s;ent us with plea&s;ure, others with pain, and we are induced to ap|proach and embrace the&s;e, to avoid and abhor tho&s;e, as &s;uch &s;en&s;a|tions direct us.</P>
<P>Thus the palates of &s;ome animals are gratefully affected by the ma&s;tication of fruits, others of grains, and others of fle&s;h; and they are thence in&s;tigated to attain, and to con&s;ume tho&s;e materials; and are furni&s;hed with powers of mu&s;cular motion, and of dige&s;tion pro|per for &s;uch purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>&s;en&s;ations</HI> and <HI>de&s;ires</HI> con&s;titute a part of our &s;y&s;tem, as our <HI>mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>bones</HI> con&s;titute another part: and hence they may alike be termed <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>connate</HI>; but neither of them can properly be termed <HI>in&s;tinctive:</HI> as the word in&s;tinct in its u&s;ual acceptation refers only to the <HI>actions</HI> of animals, as above explained: the origin of the&s;e <HI>actions</HI> is the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>

<P>II. We experience &s;ome &s;en&s;ations, and perform &s;ome actions before our nativity; the &s;en&s;ations of cold and warmth, agitation and re&s;t, fulne&s;s and inanition, are in&s;tances of the former; and the repeated &s;truggles of the limbs of the foetus, which begin about the middle of ge&s;tation, and tho&s;e motions by which it frequently wraps the um|bilical chord around its neck or body, and even &s;ometimes ties it on a knot; are in&s;tances of the latter. Smellie's Midwifery, (Vol. I. p. 182).</P>
<P>By a due attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances many of the actions of young animals, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eemed only referable to an inex|plicable in&s;tinct, will appear to have been acquired like all other ani|mal actions, that are attended with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>by the repeated efforts of our mu&s;cles under the conduct of our &s;en&s;ations or de&s;ires.</HI></P>
<P>The chick in the &s;hell begins to move its feet and legs on the &s;ixth day of incubation (Mattreican, p. 138); or on the &s;eventh day, (Langley); afterwards they are &s;een to move them&s;elves gently in the liquid that &s;urrounds them, and to open and &s;hut their mouths, (Harvei, de Generat. p. 62, and 197. Form de Poulet. ii. p. 129). Puppies before the membranes are broken, that involve them, are &s;een to move them&s;elves, to put out their tongues, and to open and &s;hut their mouths, (Harvey, Gip&s;on, Riolan, Haller). And calves lick them&s;elves and &s;wallow many of their hairs before their nativity: which however puppies do not, (Swammerden, p 319. Flemyng Phil. Tran&s;. Ann. 1755. 42). And towards the end of ge&s;tation, the foetus of all animals are proved to drink part of the liquid in which they &s;wim, (Haller. Phy&s;iol. T. 8. 204). The white of egg is found
<PB N="138" REF="152">
in the mouth and gizzard of the chick, and is nearly or quite con|&s;umed before it is hatched, (Harvei de Generat. 58). And the liquor amnii is found in the mouth and &s;tomach of the human foetus, and of calves; and how el&s;e &s;hould that excrement be produced in the in|te&s;tines of all animals, which is voided in great quantity &s;oon after their birth; Gip&s;on, Med. E&s;&s;ays, Edinb. V. i. 13. Halleri Phy&s;iolog. T. 3. p. 318. and T. 8). In the &s;tomach of a calf the quantity of this liquid amounted to about three pints, and the hairs among&s;t it were of the &s;ame colour with tho&s;e on its &s;kin, (Bla&s;ii Anat. Animal, p. m. 122). The&s;e facts are atte&s;ted by many other writers of credit, be&s;ides tho&s;e above mentioned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>III. It has been deemed a &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tance of in&s;tinct, that calves and chickens &s;hould be able to walk by a few efforts almo&s;t immedi|ately after their nativity: whil&s;t the human infant in tho&s;e countries where he is not incumbered with clothes, as in India, is five or &s;ix months, and in our climate almo&s;t a twelvemonth, before he can &s;afely &s;tand upon his feet.</P>
<P>The &s;truggles of all animals in the womb mu&s;t re&s;emble their mode of &s;wimming, as by this kind of motion they can be&s;t change their attitude in water. But the &s;wimming of the calf and chicken re|&s;embles their manner of walking, which they have thus in part ac|quired before their nativity, and hence accompli&s;h it afterwards with very few efforts, whil&s;t the &s;wimming of the human creature re|&s;embles that of the frog, and totally differs from his mode of walking.</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance to be attended to in this affair, that not only the growth of tho&s;e peculiar parts of animals, which are fir&s;t wanted to &s;ecure their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, are in general furthe&s;t advanced before their nativity: but &s;ome animals come into the world more completely formed throughout their whole &s;y&s;tem than others: and are thence much forwarder in all their habits of motion. Thus the colt, and the lamb, are much more perfect animals than the blind
<PB N="139" REF="153">
puppy, and the naked rabbit; and the chick of the phea&s;ant, and the partridge, has more perfect plumage, and more perfect eyes, as well as greater aptitude to locomotion, than the callow ne&s;tlings of the dove, and of the wren. The parents of the former only find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;hew them their food, and to teach them to take it up; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the latter are obliged for many days to obtrude it into their gaping mouths.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<P>IV. From the facts mentioned in No. 2. of this Section, it is evinced that the foetus learns to &s;wallow before its nativity; for it is &s;een to open its mouth, and its &s;tomach is found filled with the liquid that &s;ur|rounds it. It opens its mouth, either in&s;tigated by hunger, or by the irk&s;omene&s;s of a continued attitude of the mu&s;cles of its face; the liquor amnii, in which it &s;wims, is agreeable to its palate, as it con|&s;i&s;ts of a nouri&s;hing material, (Haller Phy&s;. T. 8. p. 204). It is tempted to experience its ta&s;te further in the mouth, and by a few efforts learns to &s;wallow, in the &s;ame manner as we learn all other animal actions, which are attended with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>by the repeated efforts of our mu&s;cles under the conduct of our &s;en&s;ations or volitions.</HI></P>
<P>The in&s;piration of air into the lungs is &s;o totally different from that of &s;wallowing a fluid in which we are immer&s;ed, that it cannot be acquired before our nativity. But at this time, when the circula|tion of the blood is no longer continued through the placenta, that &s;uffocating &s;en&s;ation, which we feel about the precordia, when we are in want of fre&s;h air, di&s;agreeably affects the infant: and all the mu&s;cles of the body are excited into action to relieve this oppre&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e of the brea&s;t, ribs, and diaphragm are found to an&s;wer this pur|po&s;e, and thus re&s;piration is di&s;covered, and is continued throughout our lives, as often as the oppre&s;&s;ion begins to recur. Many infants, both of the human creature, and of quadrupeds, &s;truggle for a minute after they are born before they begin to breathe, (Haller Phy&s;. T. 8. p. 400. ib. pt. 2. p. 1). Mr. Bu&s;fon thinks the action of the dry air upon the nerves of &s;mell of new-born animals, by producing an en|deavour
<PB N="140" REF="154">
to &s;neeze, may contribute to induce this fir&s;t in&s;piration, and that the rarefaction of the air by the warmth of the lungs contributes to induce expiration, Hi&s;t. Nat. Tom. 4. p. 174. Which latter it may effect by producing a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation by its delay, and a con&s;equent effort to relieve it. Many children &s;neeze before they re&s;pire, but not all, as far as I have ob&s;erved, or can learn from others.</P>
<P>At length, by the direction of its &s;en&s;e of &s;mell, or by the officious care of its mother, the young animal approaches the odoriferous rill of its future nouri&s;hment, already experienced to &s;wallow. But in the act of &s;wallowing, it is nece&s;&s;ary nearly to clo&s;e the mouth, whether the creature be immer&s;ed in the fluid it is about to drink, or not: hence, when the child fir&s;t attempts to &s;uck, it does not &s;light|ly compre&s;s the nipple between its lips, and &s;uck as an adult per&s;on would do, by ab&s;orbing the milk; but it takes the whole nipple into its mouth for this purpo&s;e, compre&s;&s;es it between its gums, and thus repeatedly chewing (as it were) the nipple, pre&s;&s;es out the milk; ex|actly in the &s;ame manner as it is drawn from the teats of cows by the hands of the milkmaid. The celebrated Harvey ob&s;erves, that the foetus in the womb mu&s;t have &s;ucked in a part of its nouri&s;hment, becau&s;e it knows how to &s;uck the minute it is born, as any one may experience by putting a finger between its lips, and becau&s;e in a few days it forgets this art of &s;ucking, and cannot without &s;ome difficulty again acquire it, (Exercit. de Gener. Anim. 48). The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion is made by Hippocrates.</P>
<P>A little further experience teaches the young animal to &s;uck by ab|&s;orption, as well as by compre&s;&s;ion; that is, to open the che&s;t as in the beginning of re&s;piration, and thus to rarefy the air in the mouth, that the pre&s;&s;ure of the den&s;er external atmo&s;phere may contribute to force out the milk.</P>
<P>The chick yet in the &s;hell has learnt to drink by &s;wallowing a part of the white of the egg for its food; but not having experienced how
<PB N="141" REF="155">
to take up and &s;wallow &s;olid &s;eeds, or grains, is either taught by the &s;olicitous indu&s;try of its mother; or by many repeated attempts is enabled at length to di&s;tingui&s;h and to &s;wallow this kind of nutri|ment.</P>
<P>And puppies, though they know how to &s;uck like other animals from their previous experience in &s;wallowing, and in re&s;piration; yet are they long in acquiring the art of lapping with their tongues, which from the flaccidity of their cheeks, and length of their mouths, is after|wards a more convenient way for them to take in water.</P>

<P>V. The &s;en&s;es of &s;mell and ta&s;te in many other animals greatly ex|cel tho&s;e of mankind, for in civilized &s;ociety, as our victuals are ge|nerally prepared by others, and are adulterated with &s;alt, &s;pice, oil, and empyreuma, we do not he&s;itate about eating whatever is &s;et before us, and neglect to cultivate the&s;e &s;en&s;es: whereas other animals try every mor&s;el by the &s;mell, before they take it into their mouths, and by the ta&s;te before they &s;wallow it: and are led not only each to his proper nouri&s;hment by this organ of &s;en&s;e, but it al&s;o at a maturer age directs them in the gratification of their appetite of love. Which may be further under&s;tood by con&s;idering the &s;ympathies of the&s;e parts de|&s;cribed in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 7.

The following curious experiment is related by Galen. "On di&s;|&s;ecting a goat great with young I found a bri&s;k embryon, and having detached it from the matrix, and &s;natching it away before it &s;aw its dam, I brought it into a certain room, where there were many ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome filled with wine, others with oil, &s;ome with honey, others with milk, or &s;ome other liquor; and in others were grains and fruits; we fir&s;t ob&s;erved the young animal get upon its feet, and walk; then it &s;hook it&s;elf, and afterwards &s;cratched its &s;ide with one of its feet: then we &s;aw it &s;melling to every one of the&s;e things, that were &s;et in the room; and when it had &s;melt to them all, it drank up the milk."

<P>Parturient quadrupeds, as cats, and bitches, and &s;ows, are led by their &s;en&s;e of &s;mell to eat the placenta as other common food; why then do they not devour their whole progeny, as is repre&s;ented in an antient emblem of TIME? This is &s;aid &s;ometimes to happen in the unnatural &s;tate in which we confine &s;ows; and indeed nature would &s;eem to have endangered her offspring in this nice circum&s;tance! But at this time the &s;timulus of the milk in the tumid teats of the mother excites her to look out for, and to de&s;ire &s;ome unknown circum&s;tance to relieve her. At the &s;ame time the &s;mell of the milk attracts the exertions of the young animals towards its &s;ource, and thus the de|lighted mother di&s;covers a new appetite, as mentioned in Sect.

The extremities of other animals terminate in horns, and hoofs, and claws, very unfit for the &s;en&s;ation of touch; whil&s;t the human hand is finely adapted to encompa&s;s its object with this organ of &s;en&s;e.</P>

The elephant is indeed endued with a fine &s;en&s;e of feeling at the extremity of his probo&s;cis, and hence has acquired much more accu|rate ideas of touch and of &s;ight than mo&s;t other creatures. The two following in&s;tances of the &s;agacity of the&s;e animals may entertain the reader, as they were told me by &s;ome gentlemen of di&s;tinct ob&s;erva|tion, and undoubted veracity, who had been much conver&s;ant with our ea&s;tern &s;ettlements. Fir&s;t, the elephants that are u&s;ed to carry the baggage of our armies, are put each under the care of one of the natives of Indo&s;tan, and whil&s;t him&s;elf and his wife go into the woods to collect leaves and branches of trees for his food, they fix him to the ground by a length of chain, and frequently leave a child yet unable to walk, under his protection: and the intelligent animal not only de|fends it, but as it creeps about, when it arrives near the extremity of his chain, he wraps his trunk gently round its body, and brings it again into the centre of his circle. Secondly, the traitor elephants are taught to walk on a narrow path between two pit-falls, which are covered with turf, and then to go into the woods, and to &s;educe the wild elephants to come that way, who fall into the&s;e wells, whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;es &s;afe between them: and it is univer&s;ally ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e wild elephants that e&s;cape the &s;nare, pur&s;ue the traitor with the ut|mo&s;t vehemence, and if they can overtake him, which &s;ometimes hap|pens, they always beat him to death.</P>
<P>The monkey has a hand well enough adapted for the &s;en&s;e of touch, which contributes to his great facility of imitation; but in taking ob|jects with his hands, as a &s;tick or an apple, he puts his thumb on the &s;ame &s;ide of them with his fingers, in&s;tead of counteracting the pre&s;|&s;ure of his fingers with it: from this neglect he is much &s;lower in ac|quiring the figures of objects, as he is le&s;s able to determine the di&s;|tances or diameters of their parts, or to di&s;tingui&s;h their vis inertiae from their hardne&s;s. Helvetius adds, that the &s;hortne&s;s of his life, his being fugitive before mankind, and his not inhabiting all climates, combine to prevent his improvement. (De PE&s;prit. T. 1. p.) There

is however at this time an old monkey &s;hewn in Exeter Change, London, who having lo&s;t his teeth, when nuts are given him, takes a &s;tone into his hand, and cracks them with it one by one; thus u&s;ing tools to effect his purpo&s;e like mankind.</P>
<P>The beaver is another animal that makes much u&s;e of his hands, and if we may credit the reports of travellers, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of amazing ingenuity. This however, M. Buffon affirms, is only where they exi&s;t in large numbers, and in countries thinly peopled with men; while in France in their &s;olitary &s;tate they &s;hew no uncommon in|genuity.</P>
<P>Indeed all the quadrupeds, that have collar-bones, (claviculae) u&s;e their fore-limbs in &s;ome mea&s;ure as we u&s;e our hands, as the cat, &s;quirrel, tyger, bear and lion; and as they exerci&s;e the &s;en&s;e of touch more univer&s;ally than other animals, &s;o are they more &s;agacious in watching and &s;urpri&s;ing their prey. All tho&s;e birds, that u&s;e their claws for hands, as the hawk, parrot, and cuckoo, appear to be more docile and intelligent; though the gregarious tribes of birds have more acquired knowledge.</P>
<P>Now as the images, that are painted on the retina of the eye, are no other than &s;igns, which recall to our imaginations the objects we had before examined by the organ of touch, as is fully demon&s;trated by Dr. Berkley in his treati&s;e on vi&s;ion; it follows that the human crea|ture has greatly more accurate and di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion than that of any other animal. Whence as he advances to maturity he gradually acquires a &s;en&s;e of female beauty, which at this time directs him to the object of his new pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sentimental love, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the animal pa&s;&s;ion of that name, with which it is frequently accompanied, con&s;i&s;ts in the de&s;ire or &s;en&s;ation of beholding, embracing, and faluting a beautiful object.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic of beauty therefore is that it is the object of love; and though many other objects are in common language called beauti|ful,
<PB N="145" REF="159">
yet they are only called &s;o metaphorically, and ought to be termed agreeable. A Grecian temple may give us the plea&s;urable idea of &s;ublimity, a Gothic temple may give us the plea&s;urable idea of va|riety, and a modern hou&s;e the plea&s;urable idea of utility; mu&s;ic and poetry may in&s;pire our love by a&s;&s;ociation of ideas; but none of the&s;e, except metaphorically, can be termed beautiful, as we have no wi&s;h to embrace or &s;alute them.</P>
<P>Our perception of beauty con&s;i&s;ts in our recognition by the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion of tho&s;e objects, fir&s;t, which have before in&s;pired our love by the plea&s;ure, which they have afforded to many of our &s;en&s;es; as to our &s;en&s;e of warmth, of touch, of &s;mell, of ta&s;te, hunger and thir&s;t; and, &s;econdly, which bear any analogy of form to &s;uch objects.</P>
<P>When the babe, &s;oon after it is born into this cold world, is applied to its mother's bo&s;om; its &s;en&s;e of perceiving warmth is fir&s;t agree|ably affected; next its &s;en&s;e of &s;mell is delighted with the odour of her milk; then its ta&s;te is gratified by the flavour of it; after|wards the appetites of hunger and of thir&s;t afford plea&s;ure by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their objects, and by the &s;ub&s;equent dige&s;tion of the ali|ment; and, la&s;tly, the &s;en&s;e of touch is delighted by the &s;oftne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of the milky fountain, the &s;ource of &s;uch variety of hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>All the&s;e various kinds of plea&s;ure at length become a&s;&s;ociated with the form of the mother's brea&s;t; which the infant embraces with its hands, pre&s;&s;es with its lips, and watches with its eyes; and thus ac|quires more accurate ideas of the form of its mother's bo&s;om, than of the odour and flavour or warmth, which it perceives by its other &s;en&s;es. And hence at our maturer years, when any object of vi&s;ion is pre&s;ented to us, which by its waving or &s;piral lines bears any &s;imili|tude to the form of the female bo&s;om, whether it be found in a land|&s;cape with &s;oft gradations of ri&s;ing and de&s;cending &s;urface, or in the forms of &s;ome antique va&s;es, or in other works of the pencil or the chi&s;&s;el, we feel a general glow of delight, which &s;eems to influence all our &s;en&s;es; and, if the object be not too large, we experience an at|traction
<PB N="146" REF="160">
to embrace it with our arms, and to &s;alute it with our lips, as we did in our early infancy the bo&s;om of our mother. And thus we find, according to the ingenious idea of Hogarth, that the waving lines of beauty were originally taken from the temple of Venus.</P>
<P>This animal attraction is love; which is a &s;en&s;ation, when the ob|ject is pre&s;ent; and a de&s;ire, when it is ab&s;ent. Which con&s;titutes the pure&s;t &s;ource of human felicity, the cordial drop in the otherwi&s;e vapid cup of life, and which overpays mankind for the care and la|bour, which are attached to the pre-eminence of his &s;ituation above other animals.</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been ob&s;erved, that colour as well as form &s;ometimes enters into our idea of a beautiful object, as a good complexion for in|&s;tance, becau&s;e a fine or fair colour is in general a &s;ign of health, and conveys to us an idea of the warmth of the object; and a pale countenance on the contrary gives an idea of its being cold to the touch.</P>
<P>It was before remarked, that young animals u&s;e their lips to di&s;|tingui&s;h the forms of things, as well as their fingers, and hence we learn the origin of our inclination to &s;alute beautiful objects with our lips.</P>

<P>VII. There are two ways by which we become acquainted with the pa&s;&s;ions of others: fir&s;t, by having ob&s;erved the effects of them, as of fear or anger, on our own bodies, we know at &s;ight when others are under the influence of the&s;e affections. So when two cocks are preparing to &s;ight, each feels the feathers ri&s;e round his own neck, and knows from the &s;ame &s;ign the di&s;po&s;ition of his adver&s;ary: and children long before they can &s;peak, or under&s;tand the language of their parents, may be frightened by an angry countenance, or &s;oothed by &s;miles and blandi&s;hments.</P>
<P>Secondly, when we put our&s;elves into the attitude that any pa&s;&s;ion naturally occa&s;ions, we &s;oon in &s;ome degree acquire that pa&s;&s;ion; hence when tho&s;e that &s;cold indulge them&s;elves in loud oaths, and
<PB N="147" REF="161">
violent actions of the arms, they increa&s;e their anger by the mode of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves: and on the contrary the counterfeited &s;mile of plea&s;ure in di&s;agreeable company &s;oon brings along with it a portion of the reality, as is well illu&s;trated by Mr. Burke. (E&s;&s;ay on the Su|blime and Beautiful.)</P>
<P>This latter method of entering into the pa&s;&s;ions of others is ren|dered of very exten&s;ive u&s;e by the plea&s;ure we take in imitation, which is every day pre&s;ented before our eyes, in the actions of chil|dren, and indeed in all the cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of the world. From this our aptitude to imitation, ari&s;es what is generally under&s;tood by the word &s;ympathy &s;o well explained by Dr. Smith of Gla&s;gow. Thus the appearance of a cheerful countenance gives us plea&s;ure, and of a melancholy one makes us &s;orrowful. Yawning and &s;ometimes vomiting are thus propagated by &s;ympathy, and &s;ome people of deli|cate fibres, at the pre&s;ence of a &s;pectacle of mi&s;ery, have felt pain in the &s;ame parts of their own bodies, that were di&s;ea&s;ed or mangled in the other. Among&s;t the writers of antiquity Ari&s;totle thought this aptitude to imitation an e&s;&s;ential property of the human &s;pecies, and calls man an imitative animal.

<P>As &s;oon as the young animal is born, the fir&s;t important &s;en&s;ations, that occur to him, are occa&s;ioned by the oppre&s;&s;ion about his pre|cordia for want of re&s;piration, and by his &s;udden tran&s;ition from ninety|eight degrees of heat into &s;o cold a climate.&mdash;He trembles, that is, he exerts alternately all the mu&s;cles of his body, to enfranchi&s;e him&s;elf from the oppre&s;&s;ion about his bo&s;om, and begins to breathe with fre|quent and &s;hort re&s;pirations; at the &s;ame time the cold contracts his red &s;kin, gradually turning it pale; the contents of the bladder and of the bowels are evacuated: and from the experience of the&s;e fir&s;t di&s;|agreeable &s;en&s;ations the pa&s;&s;ion of fear is excited, which is no other than the expectation of di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations. This early a&s;&s;ociation of motions and &s;en&s;ations per&s;i&s;ts throughout life; the pa&s;&s;ion of fear produces a cold and pale &s;kin, with tremblings, quick re&s;piration, and an evacuation of the bladder and bowels, and thus con&s;titutes the natural or univer&s;al language of this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>2. Of Grief.</HEAD>
<P>That the internal membrane of the no&s;trils may be kept always moi&s;t, for the better perception of odours, there are two canals, that conduct the tears after they have done their office in moi&s;tening and cleaning the ball of the eye into a &s;ack, which is called the lacrymal &s;ack; and from which there is a duct, that opens into the no&s;trils: the aperture of this duct is formed of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and when it is &s;timulated by odorous particles, or by the dryne&s;s or coldne&s;s of the air, the &s;ack contracts it&s;elf, and pours more of its contained moi&s;ture on the organ of &s;mell. By this contrivance the organ is rendered more fit for perceiving &s;uch odours, and is pre&s;erved from being in|jured by tho&s;e that are more &s;trong or corro&s;ive. Many other recep|tacles of peculiar fluids di&s;gorge their contents, when the ends of their ducts are &s;timulated; as the gall bladder, when the contents of the duodenum &s;timulate the extremity of the common bile duct: and the &s;alivary glands, when the termination of their ducts in the mouth are excited by the &s;timulus of the food we ma&s;ticate. Atque ve&s;iculae &s;e|minales &s;uum exprimunt fluidum glande penis fricat&acirc;.</P>
<P>The coldne&s;s and dryne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, compared with the warmth and moi&s;ture, which the new-born infant had ju&s;t before experienced, di&s;agreeably affects the aperture of this lacrymal &s;ack: the tears, that are contained in this &s;ack, are poured into the no&s;trils, and a further &s;upply is &s;ecreted by the lacrymal glands, and diffu&s;ed upon the eye-balls; as is very vi&s;ible in the eyes and no&s;trils of chil|dren &s;oon after their nativity. The &s;ame happens to us at our ma|turer age, for in &s;evere fro&s;ty weather, &s;nivelling and tears are pro|duced by the coldne&s;s and dryne&s;s of the air.</P>
<P>But the lacrymal glands, which &s;eparate the tears from the blood, are &s;ituated on the upper external part of the globes of each eye; and,

when a greater quantity of tears are wanted, we contract the fore|head, and bring down the eye-brows, and u&s;e many other di&s;tortions of the face, to compre&s;s the&s;e glands.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;uffocating &s;en&s;ation, that produces re&s;piration, is re|moved almo&s;t as &s;oon as perceived, and does not recur again: this di&s;agreeable irritation of the lacrymal ducts, as it mu&s;t frequently recur, till the tender organ becomes u&s;ed to variety of odours, is one of the fir&s;t pains that is repeatedly attended to: and hence throughout our infancy, and in many people throughout their lives, all di&s;agree|able &s;en&s;ations are attended with &s;nivelling at the no&s;e, a profu&s;ion of tears, and &s;ome peculiar di&s;tortions of countenance: according to the laws of early a&s;&s;ociation before mentioned, which con&s;titutes the natural or univer&s;al language of grief.</P>
<P>You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of the truth of this ob&s;ervation, if you will attend to what pa&s;&s;es, when you read a di&s;tre&s;sful tale alone; before the tears overflow your eyes, you will invariably feel a titilla|tion at that extremity of the lacrymal duct, which terminates in the no&s;tril, then the compre&s;&s;ion of the eyes &s;ucceeds, and the profu&s;ion of tears.</P>

<HEAD>3. Of Tender Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t mo&s;t lively impre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure, that the infant enjoys after its nativity, is excited by the odour of its mother's milk. The organ of &s;mell is irritated by this perfume, and the lacrymal &s;ack empties it&s;elf into the no&s;trils, as before explained, and an increa&s;e of tears is poured into the eyes. Any one may ob&s;erve this, when very young infants are about to &s;uck; for at tho&s;e early periods of life, the
<PB N="151" REF="165">
&s;en&s;ation affects the organ of &s;mell, much more powerfully, than after the repeated habits of &s;melling has inured it to odours of common &s;trength: and in our adult years, the &s;tronger &s;mells, though they are at the &s;ame time agreeable to us, as of volatile &s;pirits, continue to produce an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of tears.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation of &s;mell is followed by the early affection of the infant to the mother that &s;uckles it, and hence the tender feelings of gratitude and love, as well as of hopele&s;s grief, are ever after joined with the titillation of the extremity of the lacrymal ducts, and a pro|fu&s;ion of tears.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;ingular, that the lacrymal &s;ack &s;hould be influenced by plea&s;ing ideas, as the &s;ight of agreeable food produces the &s;ame effect on the &s;alivary glands. Ac dum vidimus in&s;omniis la&s;civae puellae &s;i|mulacrum tenditur penis.</P>
<P>Lambs &s;hake or wriggle their tails, at the time when they fir&s;t &s;uck, to get free of the hard excrement, which had been long lodged in their bowels. Hence this becomes afterwards a mark of plea&s;ure in them, and in dogs, and other tailed animals. But cats gently extend and contract their paws when they are plea&s;ed, and purr by drawing in their breath, both which re&s;emble their manner of &s;ucking, and thus become their language of plea&s;ure, for the&s;e animals having col|lar-bones u&s;e their paws like hands when they &s;uck, which dogs and &s;heep do not.</P>

<HEAD>4. Of Serene Plea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>In the action of &s;ucking, the lips of the infant are clo&s;ed around the nipple of its mother, till he has filled his &s;tomach, and the plea|&s;ure occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of this grateful food &s;ucceeds. Then the &s;phincter of the mouth, fatigued by the continued action of &s;uck|ing,
<PB N="152" REF="166">
is relaxed; and the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles of the face gently acting, produce the &s;mile of plea&s;ure: as cannot but be &s;een by all who are conver&s;ant with children.</P>
<P>Hence this &s;mile during our lives is a&s;&s;ociated with gentle plea&s;ure; it is vi&s;ible in kittens, and puppies, when they are played with, and tickled; but more particularly marks the human features. For in children this expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure is much encouraged, by their imi|tation of their parents, or friends; who generally addre&s;s them with a &s;miling countenance: and hence &s;ome nations are more remarkable for the gaiety, and others for the gravity of their looks.</P>

<HEAD>5. Of Anger.</HEAD>
<P>The actions that con&s;titute the mode of fighting, are the immediate language of anger in all animals; and a preparation for the&s;e actions is the natural language of threatening. Hence the human creature clenches his fi&s;t, and &s;ternly &s;urveys his adver&s;ary, as if meditating where to make the attack; the ram, and the bull, draws him&s;elf &s;ome &s;teps backwards, and levels his horns; and the hor&s;e, as he fights by &s;triking with his hinder feet, turns his heels to his foe, and bends back his ears, to li&s;ten out the place of his adver&s;ary, that the threatened blow may not be ineffectual.</P>

<HEAD>6. Of Attention.</HEAD>
<P>The eye takes in at once but half our horizon, and that only in the day, and our &s;mell informs us of no very di&s;tant objects, hence we confide principally in the organ of hearing to apprize us of danger:
<PB N="153" REF="167">
when we hear any the &s;malle&s;t &s;ound, that we cannot immediately account for, our fears are alarmed, we &s;u&s;pend our &s;teps, hold every mu&s;cle &s;till, open our mouths a little, erect our ears, and li&s;ten to gain further information: and this by habit becomes the general language of attention to objects of &s;ight, as well as of hearing; and even to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains of our ideas.</P>
<P>The natural language of violent pain, which is expre&s;&s;ed by writh|ing the body, grinning, and &s;creaming; and that of tumultuous plea&s;ure, expre&s;&s;ed in loud laughter; belong to Section XXXIV. on Di&s;ea&s;es from Volition.</P>

<P>IX. It mu&s;t have already appeared to the reader, that all other ani|mals, as well as man, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this natural language of the pa&s;&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;igns or tones; and we &s;hall endeavour to evince, that tho&s;e animals, which have pre&s;erved them&s;elves from being en|&s;laved by mankind, and are a&s;&s;ociated in flocks, are al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome artificial language, and of &s;ome traditional knowledge.</P>
<P>The mother-turkey, when &s;he eyes a kite hovering high in air, has either &s;een her own parents thrown into fear at his pre&s;ence, or has by ob&s;ervation been acquainted with his dangerous de&s;igns upon her young. She becomes agitated with fear, and u&s;es the natural language of that pa&s;&s;ion, her young ones catch the fear by imitation, and in an in&s;tant conceal them&s;elves in the gra&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that &s;he &s;hews her fears by her ge&s;ture and de|portment, &s;he u&s;es a certain exclamation, Koe-ut, Koe-ut, and the young ones afterwards know, when they hear this note, though they do not &s;ee their dam, that the pre&s;ence of their adver&s;ary is denounced, and hide them&s;elves as before.</P>
<P>The wild tribes of birds have very frequent opportunities of know|ing their enemies, by ob&s;erving the de&s;truction they make among their progeny, of which every year but a &s;mall part e&s;capes to maturity: but to our dome&s;tic birds the&s;e opportunities &s;o rarely occur, that their knowledge of their di&s;tant enemies mu&s;t frequently be de|livered
<PB N="154" REF="168">
by tradition in the manner above explained, through many generations.</P>
<P>This note of danger, as well as the other notes of the mother|turkey, when &s;he calls her flock to their flood, or to &s;leep under her wings, appears to be an artificial language, both as expre&s;&s;ed by the mother, and as under&s;tood by the progeny. For a hen teaches this language with equal ea&s;e to the ducklings, &s;he has hatched from &s;up|po&s;itious eggs, and educates as her own offspring: and the wagtails, or hedge-&s;parrows, learn it from the young cuckoo their fo&s;ter nur&s;|ling, and &s;upply him with food long after he can fly about, whenever they hear his cuckooing, which Linneus tells us, is his call of hun|ger, (Sy&s;t. Nat.) And all our dome&s;tic animals are readily taught to come to us for food, when we u&s;e one tone of voice, and to fly from our anger, when we u&s;e another.</P>
<P>Rabbits, as they cannot ea&s;ily articulate &s;ounds, and are formed into &s;ocieties, that live under ground, have a very different method of giving alarm. When danger is threatened, they thump on the ground with one of their hinder feet, and produce a &s;ound, that can be heard a great way by animals near the &s;urface of the earth, which would &s;eem to be an artificial &s;ign both from its &s;ingularity and its aptne&s;s to the &s;ituation of the animal.</P>
<P>The rabbits on the i&s;land of Sor, near Senegal, have white fle&s;h, and are well ta&s;ted, but do not burrow in the earth, &s;o that we may &s;u&s;pect their digging them&s;elves hou&s;es in this cold climate is an ac|quired art, as well as their note of alarm, (Adan&s;on's Voyage to Senegal).</P>
<P>The barking of dogs is another curious note of alarm, and would &s;eem to be an acquired language, rather than a natural &s;ign: for "in the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, the dogs did not attempt to bark, till &s;ome European dogs were put among them, and then they gradually begun to imitate them, but in a &s;trange manner at fir&s;t, as if they were learning a thing that was not natural to them," (Voyage to
<PB N="155" REF="169">
South America by Don G. Juan, and Don Ant. de Ulloa. B. 2. c. 4).</P>
<P>Linnaeus al&s;o ob&s;erves, that the dogs of South America do not bark at &s;trangers, (Sy&s;t. Nat.) And the European dogs, that have been carried to Guinea, are &s;aid in three or four generations to cea&s;e to bark, and only howl, like the dogs that are natives of that coa&s;t, (World Di&s;played, Vol. XVII. p. 26.)</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance not di&s;&s;imilar to this, and equally curious, is men|tioned by Kircherus. de Mu&s;urgia, in his Chapter de Lu&s;ciniis. "That the young nightingales, that are hatched under other birds, never &s;ing till they are in&s;tructed by the company of other nightin|gales." And Jon&s;ton affirms, that the nightingales that vi&s;it Scot|land, have not the &s;ame harmony as tho&s;e of Italy, (Pennant's Zoo|logy, octavo, p. 255); which would lead us to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;ing|ing of birds, like human mu&s;ic, is an artificial language rather than a natural expre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="subsection">
<P>X. Our mu&s;ic like our language, is perhaps entirely con&s;tituted of artificial tones, which by habit &s;ugge&s;t certain agreeable pa&s;&s;ions. For the &s;ame combination of notes and tones do not excite devotion, love, or poetic melancholy in a native of Indo&s;tan and of Europe. And "the Highlander has the &s;ame warlike ideas annexed to the &s;ound of a bagpipe (an in&s;trument which an Engli&s;hman derides), as the Engli&s;hman has to that of a trumpet or fife," (Dr. Brown's Union of Poetry and Mu&s;ic, p. 58.) So "the mu&s;ic of the Turks is very different from the Italian, and the people of Fez and Morocco have again a different kind, which to us appears very rough and hor|rid, but is highly plea&s;ing to them," (L' Arte Armoniaca a Giorgio Antoniotto). Hence we &s;ee why the Italian opera does not delight an untutored Engli&s;hman; and why tho&s;e, who are unaccu&s;tomed to mu&s;ic, are more plea&s;ed with a tune, the &s;econd or third time they hear it, than the fir&s;t. For then the &s;ame melodious train of &s;ounds excites the melancholy, they had learned from the &s;ong; or the &s;ame
<PB N="156" REF="170">
vivid combination of them recalls all the mirthful ideas of the dance and company.</P>
<P>Even the &s;ounds, that were once di&s;agreeable to us, may by habit be a&s;&s;ociated with other ideas, &s;o as to become agreeable. Father Lafitau, in his account of the Iroquois, &s;ays "the mu&s;ic and dance of tho&s;e Americans, have &s;omething in them extremely barbarous, which at fir&s;t di&s;gu&s;ts. We grow reconciled to them by degrees, and in the end partake of them with plea&s;ure, the &s;avages them&s;elves are fond of them to di&s;traction," (Moeurs des Savages, Tom. ii.)</P>
<P>There are indeed a few &s;ounds, that we very generally a&s;&s;ociate with agreeable ideas, as the whi&s;tling of birds, or purring of animals, that are delighted; and &s;ome others, that we as generally a&s;&s;ociate with di&s;agreeable ideas, as the cries of animals in pain, the hi&s;s of &s;ome of them in anger, and the midnight howl of bea&s;ts of prey. Yet we receive no terrible or &s;ublime ideas from the lowing of a cow, or the braying of an a&s;s. Which evinces, that the&s;e emotions are owing to previous a&s;&s;ociations. So if the rumbling of a carriage in the &s;treet be for a moment mi&s;taken for thunder, we receive a &s;ub|lime &s;en&s;ation, which cea&s;es as &s;oon as we know it is the noi&s;e of a coach and &s;ix.</P>
<P>There are other di&s;agreeable &s;ounds, that are &s;aid to &s;et the teeth on edge; which, as they have always been thought a nece&s;&s;ary effect of certain di&s;cordant notes, become a proper &s;ubject of our enquiry. Every one in his childhood has repeatedly bit a part of the gla&s;s or earthen ve&s;&s;el, in which his food has been given him, and has thence had a very di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation in the teeth, which &s;en&s;ation was de|&s;igned by nature to prevent us from exerting them on objects harder than them&s;elves. The jarring &s;ound produced between the cup and the teeth is always attendant on this di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation: and ever after when &s;uch a &s;ound is accidentally produced by the conflict of two hard bodies, we feel by a&s;&s;ociation of ideas the concomitant di&s;|agreeable &s;en&s;ation in our teeth.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="171">
Others have in their infancy frequently held the corner of a &s;ilk handkerchief in their mouth, or the end of the velvet cape of their coat, whil&s;t their companions in play have plucked it from them, and have given another di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation to their teeth, which has afterwards recurred on touching tho&s;e materials. And the &s;ight of a knife drawn along a china plate, though no &s;ound is excited by it, and even the imagination of &s;uch a knife and plate &s;o &s;craped together, I know by repeated experience will produce the &s;ame di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of the teeth.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances indi&s;putably prove, that this &s;en&s;ation of the tooth-edge is owing to a&s;&s;ociated ideas; as it is equally excitable by &s;ight, touch, hearing, or imagination.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the artificial proportions of &s;ound excited by mu&s;ical in&s;truments, tho&s;e, who have early in life a&s;&s;ociated them with agree|able ideas, and have nicely attended to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other, are &s;aid to have a good ear, in that country where &s;uch pro|portions are in fa&s;hion: and not from any &s;uperior perfection in the organ of hearing, or any in&s;tinctive &s;ympathy between certain &s;ounds and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved a child to be exqui&s;itely delighted with mu&s;ic, and who could with great facility learn to &s;ing any tune that he heard di&s;tinctly, and yet who&s;e organ of hearing was &s;o imperfect, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak louder to him in common conver&s;ation than to others.</P>
<P>Our mu&s;ic, like our architecture, &s;eems to have no foundation in nature, they are both arts purely of human creation, as they imitate nothing. And the profe&s;&s;ors of them have only cla&s;&s;ed tho&s;e circum|&s;tances, that are mo&s;t agreeable to the accidental ta&s;te of their age, or country; and have called it Proportion. But this proportion mu&s;t always fluctuate, as it re&s;ts on the caprices, that are introduced into our minds by our various modes of education. And the&s;e fluctuations
<PB N="158" REF="172">
of ta&s;te mu&s;t become more frequent in the pre&s;ent age, where man|kind have enfranchi&s;ed them&s;elves from the blind obedience to the rules of antiquity in perhaps every &s;cience, but that of architecture. See Sect. XII. No. 7. 3.</P>

<P>XI. There are many articles of knowledge, which the animals in cultivated countries &s;eem to learn very early in their lives, either from each other, or from experience, or ob&s;ervation: one of the mo&s;t general of the&s;e is to avoid mankind. There is &s;o great a re&s;emblance in the natural language of the pa&s;&s;ions of all animals, that we gene|rally know, when they are in a pacific, or in a malevolent humour, they have the &s;ame knowledge of us; and hence we can &s;cold them from us by &s;ome tones and ge&s;tures, and could po&s;&s;ibly attract them to us by others, if they were not already apprized of our general ma|levolence towards them. Mr. Gmelin, Profe&s;&s;or at Peter&s;burg, a&s;|&s;ures us, that in his journey into Siberia, undertaken by order of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, he &s;aw foxes, that expre&s;&s;ed no fear of him&s;elf or companions, but permitted him to come quite near them, having never &s;een the human creature before. And Mr. Bongainville relates, that at his arrival at the Malouine, or Falkland's I&s;lands, which were not inhabited by men, all the animals came about him&s;elf and his people; the fowls &s;ettling upon their heads and &s;houlders, and the quadrupeds running about their feet. From the difficulty of acquir|ing the confidence of old animals, and the ea&s;e of taming young ones, it appears that the fear, they all conceive at the &s;ight of mankind, is an acquired article of knowledge.</P>
<P>This knowledge is more nicely under&s;tood by rooks, who are formed into &s;ocieties, and build, as it were, cities over our heads; they evidently di&s;tingui&s;h, that the danger is greater when a man is armed with a gun. Every one has &s;een this, who in the &s;pring of the year has walked under a rookery with a gun in his hand: the in|habitants of the trees ri&s;e on their wings, and &s;cream to the unfledged
<PB N="159" REF="173">
young to &s;hrink into their ne&s;ts from the &s;ight of the enemy. The vulgar ob&s;erving this circum&s;tance &s;o uniformly to occur, a&s;&s;ert that rooks can &s;mell gun-powder.</P>
<P>The fieldfairs, (turdus pilarus) which breed in Norway, and come hither in the cold &s;ea&s;on for our winter berries; as they are a&s;&s;ociated in flocks, and are in a foreign country, have evident marks of keeping a kind of watch, to remark and announce the appearance of danger. On approaching a tree, that is covered with them, they continue fear|le&s;s till one at the extremity of the bu&s;h ri&s;ing on his wings gives a loud and peculiar note of alarm, when they all immediately fly, ex|cept one other, who continues till you approach &s;till nearer, to cer|tify as it were the reality of the danger, and then he al&s;o flies off re|peating the note of alarm.</P>
<P>And in the woods about Senegal there is a bird called uett-uett by the negroes, and &s;quallers by the French, which, as &s;oon as they &s;ee a man, &s;et up a loud &s;cream, and keep flying round him, as if their intent was to warn other birds, which upon hearing the cry im|mediately take wing. The&s;e birds are the bane of &s;port&s;men, and frequently put me into a pa&s;&s;ion, and obliged me to &s;hoot them, (Adan&s;on's Voyage to Senegal, 78). For the &s;ame intent the le&s;&s;er birds of our climate &s;eem to fly after a hawk, cuckoo, or owl, and &s;cream to prevent their companions from being &s;urpri&s;ed by the general enemies of them&s;elves, or of their eggs and pro|geny.</P>
<P>But the lapwing, (charadrius pluvialis Lin.) when her unfledged offspring run about the mar&s;hes, where they were hatched, not only gives the note of alarm at the approach of men or dogs, that her young may conceal them&s;elves; but flying and &s;creaming near the adver&s;ary, &s;he appears more &s;olicitous and impatient, as he recedes from her family, and thus endeavours to mi&s;lead him, and frequently &s;ucceeds in her de&s;ign. The&s;e la&s;t in&s;tances are &s;o appo&s;ite to the &s;itu|ation, rather than to the natures of the creatures, that u&s;e them; and
<PB N="160" REF="174">
are &s;o &s;imilar to the actions of men in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, that we cannot but believe, that they proceed from a &s;imilar principle.</P>
<P>On the northern coa&s;t of Ireland a friend of mine &s;aw above a hundred crows at once preying upon mu&s;cles; each crow took a mu&s;cle up into the air twenty or forty yards high, and let it fall on the &s;tones, and thus by breaking the &s;hell, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ani|mal.&mdash;A certain philo&s;opher (I think it was Anaxagoras) walking along the &s;ea-&s;hore to gather &s;hells, one of the&s;e unlucky birds mi&s;|taking his bald head for a &s;tone, dropped a &s;hell-fi&s;h upon it, and killed at once a philo&s;opher and an oy&s;ter.</P>
<P>Our dome&s;tic animals, that have &s;ome liberty, are al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome peculiar traditional knowledge: dogs and cats have been forced into each other's &s;ociety, though naturally animals of a very different kind, and have hence learned from each other to eat the knot-gra&s;s, when they are &s;ick, to promote vomiting. I have &s;een a cat mi&s;take the blade of barley for this gra&s;s, which evinces it is an acquired know|ledge. They have al&s;o learnt of each other to cover their excrement and urine;&mdash;about a &s;poonful of water was &s;pilt upon my hearth from the tea-kettle, and I ob&s;erved a kitten cover it with a&s;hes. Hence this mu&s;t al&s;o be an acquired art, as the creature mi&s;took the applica|tion of it.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve their fur clean, and e&s;pecially their whi&s;kers, cats wa&s;h their faces, and generally quite behind their ears, every time they eat. As they cannot lick tho&s;e places with their tongues, they fir&s;t wet the in&s;ide of the leg with &s;aliva, and then repeatedly wa&s;h their faces with it, which mu&s;t originally be an effect of rea&s;oning, becau&s;e a means is u&s;ed to produce an effect; and &s;eems afterwards to be taught or acquired by imitation, like the greate&s;t part of human arts.</P>
<P>Mr. Leonard, a very intelligent friend of mine, &s;aw a cat catch a trout by darting upon it in a deep clear water at the mill at Weaford, near Lichfield. The cat belonged to Mr. Stanley, who had often
<PB N="161" REF="175">
&s;een her catch fi&s;h in the &s;ame manner in &s;ummer, when the mill-pool was drawn &s;o low, that the fi&s;h could be &s;een. I have heard of other cats taking fi&s;h in &s;hallow water, as they &s;tood on the bank. This &s;eems a natural art of taking their prey in cats, which their acquired delicacy by dome&s;tication has in general prevented them from u&s;ing, though their de&s;ire of eating fi&s;h continues in its original &s;trength.</P>
<P>Mr. White, in his ingenious Hi&s;tory of Selbourn, was witne&s;s to a cat's &s;uckling a young hare, which followed her about the garden, and came jumping to her call of affection. At Elford, near Lich|field, the Rev. Mr. Sawley had taken the young ones out of a hare, which was &s;hot; they were alive, and the cat, who had ju&s;t lo&s;t her own kittens, carried them away, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to eat them; but it pre&s;ently appeared, that it was affection not hunger which incited her, as &s;he &s;uckled them, and brought them up as their mother.</P>
<P>Other in&s;tances of the mi&s;taken application of what has been termed in&s;tinct may be ob&s;erved in flies in the night, who mi&s;taking a candle for day-light, approach and peri&s;h in the flame. So the pu|trid &s;mell of the &s;tapelia, or carrion-flower, allures the large fle&s;h-fly to depo&s;it its young worms on its beautiful petals, which peri&s;h there for want of nouri&s;hment. This therefore cannot be a nece&s;&s;ary in|&s;tinct, becau&s;e the creature mi&s;takes the application of it.</P>

from their mode of fighting mentioned No. 8. 5. of this Section, as well as by common ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome parts of a hor&s;e, which he cannot conveniently rub, when they itch, as about the &s;houlder, which he can neither bite with his teeth, nor &s;cratch with his hind foot; when this part itches, he goes to another hor&s;e, and gently bites him in the part which he wi&s;hes to be bitten, which is immediately done by his intelligent friend. I once ob&s;erved a young foal thus bite its large mother, who did not choo&s;e to drop the gra&s;s &s;he had in her mouth, and rubbed her no&s;e again&s;t the foal's neck in&s;tead of biting it; which evinces that &s;he knew the de&s;ign of her progeny, and was not governed by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;tinct to bite where &s;he was bitten.</P>
<P>Many of our &s;hrubs, which would otherwi&s;e afford an agreeable food to hor&s;es, are armed with thorns or prickles, which &s;ecure them from tho&s;e animals; as the holly, hawthorn, goo&s;eberry, gor&s;e. In the exten&s;ive moorlands of Stafford&s;hire, the hor&s;es have learnt to &s;tamp upon a gor&s;e-bu&s;h with one of their fore-fect for a minute to|gether, and when the points are broken, they eat it without injury. Which is an art other hor&s;es in the fertile parts of the county do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and prick their mouths till they bleed, if they are induced by hunger or caprice to attempt eating gor&s;e.</P>
<P>Swine have a &s;en&s;e of touch as well as of &s;mell at the end of their no&s;e, which they u&s;e as a hand, both to root up the &s;oil, and to turn over and examine objects of food, &s;omewhat like the probo&s;cis of an elephant. As they require &s;helter from the cold in this climate, they have learnt to collect &s;traw in their mouths to make their ne&s;t, when the wind blows cold; and to call their companions by repeated cries to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the work, and add to their warmth by their numerous bed|fellows. Hence the&s;e animals, which are e&s;teemed &s;o unclean, have al&s;o learned never to befoul their dens, where they have liberty, with their own excrement; an art, which cows and hor&s;es, which have open hovels to run into, have never acquired.

<P>A dog who&s;e natural prey is &s;heep, is taught by mankind, not only to leave them unmole&s;ted, but to guard them; and to hunt, to &s;et, or to de&s;troy other kinds of animals, as birds, or vermin; and in &s;ome countries to catch fi&s;h, in others to find truffles, and to practi&s;e a great variety of tricks; is it more &s;urpri&s;ing that the crows &s;hould teach each other, that the hawk can catch le&s;s birds, by the &s;uperior &s;wiftne&s;s of his wing, and if two of them follow him, till he &s;ucceeds in his de&s;ign, that they can by force &s;hare a part of the capture?

<P>There is one kind of pelican mentioned by Mr. O&s;beck, one of Linnaeus's travelling pupils (the pelicanus aquilus), who&s;e food is fi&s;h; and which it takes from other birds, becau&s;e it is not formed to catch them it&s;elf; hence it is called by the Engli&s;h a Man-of-war-bird, Voyage to China, p. 88. There are many other intere&s;ting anec|dotes of the pelican and cormorant, collected from authors of the be&s;t authority, in a well-managed Natural Hi&s;tory for Children, publi&s;hed by Mr. Galton.

They &s;wim in flocks, and form a large circle, which they contract afterwards, driving the fi&s;h before them with their legs: when they &s;ee the fi&s;h in &s;ufficient number confined in this &s;pace, they plunge their bill wide open into the water, and &s;hut it again with great quickne&s;s.

<P>XII. The knowledge and language of tho&s;e birds, that frequently change their climate with the &s;ea&s;ons, is &s;till more exten&s;ive: as they perform the&s;e migrations in large &s;ocieties, and are le&s;s &s;ubject to the power of man, than the re&s;ident tribes of birds. They are &s;aid to follow a leader during the day, who is occa&s;ionally changed, and to keep a continual cry during the night to keep them&s;elves together. It is probable that the&s;e emigrations were at fir&s;t undertaken as acci|dent directed, by the more adventurous of their &s;pecies, and learned from one another like the di&s;coveries of mankind in navigation. The following circum&s;tances &s;trongly &s;upport this opinion.</P>
<P N="1">1. Nature has provided the&s;e animals, in the climates where they are produced, with another re&s;ource: when the &s;ea&s;on becomes too cold for their con&s;titutions, or the food they were &s;upported with cea&s;es to be &s;upplied, I mean that of &s;leeping. Dormice, &s;nakes, and bats, have not the means of changing their country; the two former from the want of wings, and the latter from his being not able to bear the light of the day. Hence the&s;e animals are obliged to make u&s;e of this re&s;ource, and &s;leep during the winter. And tho&s;e &s;wallows that have been hatched too late in the year to acquire their full &s;trength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident or di&s;ea&s;e, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and even under water in this torpid &s;tate, from which they have been revived by the warmth of a fire. This torpid &s;tate of &s;wal|lows is te&s;tified by innumerable evidences both of antient and modern names. Ari&s;totle &s;peaking of the &s;wallows &s;ays, "They pa&s;s into
<PB N="165" REF="179">
warmer climates in winter, if &s;uch places are at no great di&s;tance; if they are, they bury them&s;elves in the climates where they dwell," (8. Hi&s;t. c. 16. See al&s;o Derham's Phy&s;. Theol. v. ii. p. 177.)</P>
<P>Hence their emigrations cannot depend on a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in&s;tinct, as the emigrations them&s;elves are not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When the weather becomes cold, the &s;wallows in the neigh|bourhood a&s;&s;emble in large flocks; that is, the unexperienced attend tho&s;e that have before experienced the journey they are about to un|dertake: they are then &s;een &s;ome time to hover on the coa&s;t, till there is calm weather, or a wind, that &s;uits the direction of their flight. Other birds of pa&s;&s;age have been drowned by thou&s;ands in the &s;ea, or have &s;ettled on &s;hips quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue. And others, either by mi&s;taking their cour&s;e, or by di&s;tre&s;s of weather, have arrived in countries where they were never &s;een before: and thus are evidently &s;ubject to the &s;ame hazards that the human &s;pecies undergo, in the execution of their artificial purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ame birds are emigrant from &s;ome countries and not &s;o from others: the &s;wallows were &s;een at Goree in January by an in|genious philo&s;opher of my acquaintance, and he was told that they continued there all the year; as the warmth of the climate was at all &s;ea&s;ons &s;ufficient for their own con&s;titutions, and for the production of the flies that &s;upply them with nouri&s;hment. Herodotus &s;ays, that in Libya, about the &s;prings of the Nile, the &s;wallows continue all the year. (L. 2.)</P>
<P>Quails (tetrao corturnix, Lin.) are birds of pa&s;&s;age from the coa&s;t of Barbary to Italy, and have frequently &s;ettled in large &s;hoals on &s;hips fatigued with their flight. (Ray, Wi&s;dom of God, p. 129. Derham Phy&s;ic. Theol. v. ii. p. 178.) Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, in his Hi&s;tory of Aleppo, ob&s;erves that the &s;wallows vi&s;it that country about the end of Febru|ary, and having hatched their young di&s;appear about the end of July; and returning again about the beginning of October, continue about a fortnight, and then again di&s;appear. (P. 70.)</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="180">
When my late friend Dr. Chambres, of Derby, was on the i&s;land of Caprea in the bay of Naples, he was informed that great flights of quails annually &s;ettle on that i&s;land about the beginning of May, in their pa&s;&s;age from Africa to Europe. And that they always come when the &s;outh-ea&s;t wind blows, are fatigued when they re&s;t on this i&s;land, and are taken in &s;uch amazing quantities and &s;old to the Con|tinent, that the inhabitants pay the bi&s;hop his &s;tipend out of the pro|fits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of them.</P>
<P>The flights of the&s;e birds acro&s;s the Mediterranean are recorded near three thou&s;and years ago. "There went forth a wind from the Lord and brought quails from the &s;ea, and let them fall upon the camp, a day's journey round about it, and they were two cubits above the earth," (Numbers, chap. ii. ver. 31.)</P>
<P>In our country, Mr. Pennant informs us, that &s;ome quails migrate, and others only remove from the internal parts of the i&s;land to the coa&s;ts, (Zoology, octavo, 210.) Some of the ringdoves and &s;tares breed here, others migrate, (ibid. 510, 511.) And the &s;lender billed &s;mall birds do not all quit the&s;e kingdoms in the winter, though the difficulty of procuring the worms and in&s;ects, that they feed on, &s;up|plies the &s;ame rea&s;on for migration to them all, (ibid. 511.)</P>
<P>Linnaeus has ob&s;erved, that in Sweden the female chaffinches quit that country in September, migrating into Holland, and leave their mates behind till their return in &s;pring. Hence he has called them Fringilla caelebs, (Amaen. Acad. ii. 42. iv. 595.) Now in our cli|mate both &s;exes of them are perennial birds. And Mr. Pennant ob|&s;erves that the hoopoe, chatterer, hawfinch, and cro&s;sbill, migrate into England &s;o rarely, and at &s;uch uncertain times, as not to de&s;erve to be ranked among our birds of pa&s;&s;age, (ibid. 511.)</P>
<P>The water fowl, as gee&s;e and ducks, are better adapted for long migrations, than the other tribes of birds, as, when the weather is calm, they can not only re&s;t them&s;elves, or &s;leep upon the ocean, but po&s;&s;ibly procure &s;ome kind of food from it.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="181">
Hence in Siberia, as &s;oon as the lakes are frozen, the water &s;owl, which are very numerous, all di&s;appear, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to fly to warmer climates, except the rail, which, from its inability for long flights, probably &s;leeps, like our bat, in their winter. The follow|ing account from the Journey of Profe&s;&s;or Gmelin, may entertain the reader. "In the neighbourhood of Kra&s;noiark, among&s;t many other emigrant water fowls, we ob&s;erved a great number of rails, which when pur&s;ued never took flight, but endeavoured to e&s;cape by run|ning. We enquired how the&s;e birds, that could not fly, could retire into other countries in the winter, and were told, both by the Tar|tars and A&s;&s;anians, that they well knew tho&s;e birds could not alone pa&s;s into other countries: but when the crains (les grues) retire in autumn, each one takes a rail (un rale) upon his back, and carries him to a warmer climate."</P>

<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears that the migrations of birds are not produced by a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tinct, but are accidental improve|ments, like the arts among mankind, taught by their cotemporaries, or delivered by tradition from one generation of them to another.</P>

Their choice of the proper &s;ea&s;on, their contracts of mar|riage, and the regularity with which they con&s;truct their ne&s;ts, have in all ages excited the admiration of naturali&s;ts; and have always been attributed to the power of in&s;tinct, which, like the occult qualities of the antient philo&s;ophers, prevented all further enquiry. We &s;hall con&s;ider them in their order.</P>

<HEAD>Their Choice of the Sea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>Our dome&s;tic birds, that are plentifully &s;upplied throughout the year with their adapted food, and are covered with hou&s;es from the inclemency of the weather, lay their eggs at any &s;ea&s;on: which evinces that the &s;pring of the year is not pointed out to them by a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the wild tribes of birds choo&s;e this time of the year from their acquired knowledge, that the mild temperature of the air is more convenient for hatching their eggs, and is &s;oon likely to &s;upply that kind of nouri&s;hment, that is wanted for their young.</P>
<P>If the genial warmth of the &s;pring produced the pa&s;&s;ion of love, as it expands the foliage of trees, all other animals &s;hould feel its influ|ence as well as birds: but, the viviparous creatures, as they &s;uckle their young, that is, as they previou&s;ly dige&s;t the natural food, that it may better &s;uit the tender &s;tomachs of their offspring, experience the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, as cats and bitches. The graminivorous animals indeed generally produce their young about the time when gra&s;s is &s;upplied in the greate&s;t plenty, but this is without any degree of exactne&s;s, as appears from our cows, &s;heep, and hares, and may be a part of the traditional knowledge, which they learn from the example of their parents.</P>

<HEAD>Their Contracts of Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>Their mutual pa&s;&s;ion, and their acquired knowledge, that their joint labour is nece&s;&s;ary to procure &s;u&s;tenance for their numerous fa|mily, induces the wild birds to enter into a contract of marriage, which does not however take place among the ducks, gee&s;e, and fowls, that are provided with their daily food from our barns.</P>
<P>An ingenious philo&s;opher has lately denied, that animals can enter into contracts, and thinks this an e&s;&s;ential difference between them and the human creature:&mdash;but does not daily ob&s;ervation convince us, that they form contracts of friend&s;hip with each other, and with mankind? When puppies and kittens play together, is there not a tacit contract, that they will not hurt each other? And does not your favorite dog expect you &s;hould give him his daily food, for his &s;ervices and attention to you? And thus barters his love for your protection?

<HEAD>The Con&s;truction of their Ne&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. They &s;eem to be in&s;tructed how to build their ne&s;ts from their ob&s;ervation of that, in which they were educated, and from their knowledge of tho&s;e things, that are mo&s;t agreeable to their touch in re&s;pect to warmth, cleanline&s;s, and &s;tability. They choo&s;e their &s;ituations from their ideas of &s;afety from their enemies, and of &s;helter from the weather. Nor is the colour of their ne&s;ts a circum&s;tance unthought of; the finches, that build in green hedges, cover their habitations with green mo&s;s; the &s;wallow or martin, that builds
<PB N="170" REF="184">
again&s;t rocks and hou&s;es, covers her's with clay, whil&s;t the lark choo&s;es vegetable &s;traw nearly of the colour of the ground &s;he inha|bits: by this contrivance, they are all le&s;s liable to be di&s;covered by their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor are the ne&s;ts of the &s;ame &s;pecies of birds con&s;tructed always of the &s;ame materials, nor in the &s;ame form; which is another cir|cum&s;tance that a&s;certains, that they are led by ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In the trees before Mr. Levet's hou&s;e in Lichfield, there are an|nually ne&s;ts built by &s;parrows, a bird which u&s;ually builds under the tiles of hou&s;es, or the thatch of barns. Not finding &s;uch convenient &s;ituations for their ne&s;ts, they build a covered ne&s;t bigger than a man's head, with an opening like a mouth at the &s;ide, re&s;embling that of a magpie, except that it is built with &s;traw and hay, and lined with feathers, and &s;o nicely managed as to be a defence again&s;t both wind and rain.</P>
<P>So the jackdaw (corvus monedula) generally builds in church|&s;teeples, or under the roofs of high hou&s;es; but at Selbourn, in Southampton&s;hire, where towers and &s;teeples are not &s;ufficiently nu|merous, the&s;e &s;ame birds build in for&s;aken rabbit burrows. See a cu|rious account of the&s;e &s;ubterranean ne&s;ts in White's Hi&s;tory of Sel|bourn, p. 59. Can the &s;kilful change of architecture in the&s;e birds and the &s;parrows above mentioned be governed by in&s;tinct? Then they mu&s;t have two in&s;tincts, one for common, and the other for extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have &s;een green wor&s;ted in a ne&s;t, which no where exi&s;ts in na|ture: and the down of thi&s;tles in tho&s;e ne&s;ts, that were by &s;ome ac|cident con&s;tructed later in the &s;ummer, which material could not be procured for the earlier ne&s;ts: in many different climates they cannot procure the &s;ame materials, that they u&s;e in ours. And it is well known, that the canary birds, that are propagated in this country, and the finches, that are kept tame, will build their ne&s;ts of any flexile
<PB N="171" REF="185">
materials, that are given them. Plutarch, in his Book on Rivers, &s;peaking of the Nile, &s;ays, "that the &s;wallows collect a material, when the waters recede, with which they form ne&s;ts, that are im|pervious to water." And in India there is a &s;wallow that collects a glutinous &s;ub&s;tance for this purpo&s;e, who&s;e ne&s;t is e&s;culent, and e&s;teemed a principal rarity among&s;t epicures, (Lin. Sy&s;t. Nat.) Both the&s;e mu&s;t be con&s;tructed of very different materials from tho&s;e u&s;ed by the &s;wallows of our country.</P>
<P>In India the birds exert more artifice in building their ne&s;ts on ac|count of the monkeys and &s;nakes: &s;ome form their pen&s;ile ne&s;ts in the &s;hape of a pur&s;e, deep and open at top; others with a hole in the &s;ide; and others, &s;till more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their lodge near the &s;ummit. But the taylor-bird will not ever tru&s;t its ne&s;t to the extremity of a tender twig, but makes one more advance to &s;afety by fixing it to the leaf it&s;elf. It picks up a dead leaf, and &s;ews it to the &s;ide of a living one, its &s;lender bill being its needle, and its thread &s;ome fine fibres; the lining con|&s;i&s;ts of feathers, go&s;&s;amer, and down; its eggs are white, the colour of the bird light yellow, its length three inches, its weight three &s;ix|teenths of an ounce; &s;o that the materials of the ne&s;t, and the weight of the bird, are not likely to draw down an habitation &s;o &s;lightly &s;u&s;|pended. A ne&s;t of this bird is pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, (Pen|nant's Indian Zoology). This calls to one's mind the Mo&s;aic ac|count of the origin of mankind, the fir&s;t dawning of art there a&s;cribed to them, is that of &s;ewing leaves together.

<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e birds that are brought up by our care, and have had little communication with others of their own &s;pecies, are very de|fective in this acquired knowledge; they are not only very awkward in the con&s;truction of their ne&s;ts, but generally &s;catter their eggs in various parts of the room or cage, where they are confined, and &s;eldom
<PB N="172" REF="186">
produce young ones, till, by failing in their fir&s;t attempt, they have learnt &s;omething from their own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="4">4. During the time of incubation birds are &s;aid in general to turn their eggs every day; &s;ome cover them, when they leave the ne&s;t, as ducks and gee&s;e; in &s;ome the male is &s;aid to bring food to the female, that &s;he may have le&s;s occa&s;ion of ab&s;ence, in others he is &s;aid to take her place, when &s;he goes in que&s;t of food; and all of them are &s;aid to leave their eggs a &s;horter time in cold weather than in warm. In Se|negal the o&s;trich &s;its on her eggs only during the night, leaving them in the day to the heat of the &s;un; but at the Cape of Good Hope, where the heat is le&s;s, &s;he &s;its on them day and night.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, what induces a bird to &s;it weeks on its fir&s;t eggs uncon&s;cious that a brood of young ones will be the product? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, that it is the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion that induces the hu|man mother to hold her offspring whole nights and days in her fond arms, and pre&s;s it to her bo&s;om, uncon&s;cious of its future growth to &s;en&s;e and manhood, till ob&s;ervation or tradition have informed her.</P>
<P N="5">5. And as many ladies are too refined to nur&s;e their own children, and deliver them to the care and provi&s;ion of others; &s;o is there one in&s;tance of this vice in the feathered world. The cuckoo in &s;ome parts of England, as I am well informed by a very di&s;tinct and ingenious gentleman, hatches and educates her own young; whil&s;t in other parts &s;he builds no ne&s;t, but u&s;es that of &s;ome le&s;&s;er bird, generally either of the wagtail, or hedge &s;parrow, and depo&s;iting one egg in it, takes no further care of her progeny.</P>
<P>As the Rev. Mr. Stafford was walking in Glo&s;op Dale, in the Peak of Derby&s;hire, he &s;aw a cuckoo ri&s;e from its ne&s;t. The ne&s;t was on the &s;tump of a tree, that had been &s;ome time felled, among &s;ome chips that were in part turned grey, &s;o as much to re&s;emble the colour of the bird, in this ne&s;t were two young cuckoos: tying a &s;tring about the leg of one of them, he pegged the other end of it to the ground,
<PB N="173" REF="187">

The remora, when he wi&s;hes to remove his &s;ituation, as he is a very &s;low &s;wimmer, is content to take an out&s;ide place on whatever conveyance is going his way; nor can the cunning animal be tempted to quit his hold of a &s;hip when &s;he is &s;ailing, not even for the lucre of a piece of pork, le&s;t it &s;hould endanger the lo&s;s of his pa&s;&s;age: at other times he is ea&s;ily caught with the hook.</P>
<P N="4">4. The crab-fi&s;h, like many other te&s;taceous animals, annually changes its &s;hell; it is then in a &s;oft &s;tate, covered only with a mucous membrane, and conceals it&s;elf in holes in the &s;and or under weeds; at this place a hard &s;helled crab always &s;tands centinel, to prevent the &s;ea in&s;ects from injuring the other in its defencele&s;s &s;tate; and the fi&s;hermen from his appearance know where to find the &s;oft ones, which they u&s;e for baits in catching other fi&s;h.</P>
<P>And though the hard &s;helled crab, when he is on this duty, ad|vances boldly to meet the foe, and will with difficulty quit the field; yet at other times he &s;hews great timidity, and has a wonderful &s;peed in attempting his e&s;cape; and, if often interrupted, will pretend death like the &s;pider, and watch an opportunity to &s;ink him&s;elf into the &s;and, keeping only his eyes above. My ingenious friend Mr. Burdett, who favoured me with the&s;e accounts at the time he was &s;urveying the coa&s;ts, thinks the commerce between the &s;exes takes place at this time, and in&s;pires the courage of the creature.</P>

fall back many times before they &s;urmount it, and ba&s;kets made of twigs are placed near the edge of the &s;tream to catch them in their fall.</P>

<P>XV. We have a very imperfect acquaintance with the various tribes of in&s;ects: their occupations, manner of life, and even the number of their &s;en&s;es, differ from our own, and from each other; but there is rea&s;on to imagine, that tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="176" REF="190">
touch in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite degree, and who&s;e occupations require the mo&s;t con&s;tant exertion of their powers, are indued with a greater proportion of knowledge and ingenuity.</P>
<P>The &s;piders of this country manufacture nets of various forms, adapted to various &s;ituations, to arre&s;t the flies that are their food; and &s;ome of them have a hou&s;e or lodging-place in the middle of the net, well contrived for warmth, &s;ecurity, or concealment. There is a large &s;pider in South America, who con&s;tructs nets of &s;o &s;trong a texture as to entangle &s;mall birds, particularly the humming bird. And in Jamaica there is another &s;pider, who digs a hole in the earth obliquely downwards, about three inches in length, and one inch in diameter, this cavity &s;he lines with a tough thick web, which when taken out re&s;embles a leathern pur&s;e: but what is mo&s;t curious, this hou&s;e has a door with hinges, like the operculum of &s;ome &s;ea &s;hells; and her&s;elf and family, who tenant this ne&s;t, open and &s;hut the door, whenever they pa&s;s or repa&s;s. This hi&s;tory was told me, and the ne&s;t with its operculum &s;hewn me by the late Dr. Butt of Bath, who was &s;ome years phy&s;ician in Jamaica.</P>
<P>The production of the&s;e nets is indeed a part of the nature or con|formation of the animal, and their natural u&s;e is to &s;upply the place of wings, when &s;he wi&s;hes to remove to another &s;ituation. But when &s;he employs them to entangle her prey, there are marks of evident de&s;ign, for &s;he adapts the form of each net to its &s;ituation, and &s;trengthens tho&s;e lines, that require it, by joining others to the middle of them, and attaching tho&s;e others to di&s;tant objects, with the &s;ame individual art, that is u&s;ed by mankind in &s;upporting the ma&s;ts and extending the &s;ails of &s;hips. This work is executed with more ma|thematical exactne&s;s and ingenuity by the field &s;piders, than by tho&s;e in our hou&s;es, as their con&s;tructions are more &s;ubjected to the injuries of dews and tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ingenuity &s;hewn by the&s;e little creatures in taking their prey, the circum&s;tance of their counterfeiting death, when they are
<PB N="177" REF="191">
put into terror, is truly wonderful; and as &s;oon as the object of terror is removed, they recover and run away. Some beetles are al&s;o &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s this piece of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>The curious webs, or chords, con&s;tructed by &s;ome young cater|pillars to defend them&s;elves from cold, or from in&s;ects of prey; and by &s;ilk-worms and &s;ome other caterpillars, when they tran&s;migrate into aureliae or larvae, have de&s;ervedly excited the admiration of the inqui&s;itive. But our ignorance of their manner of life, and even of the number of their &s;en&s;es, totally precludes us from under&s;tanding the means by which they acquire this knowledge.</P>
<P>The care of the &s;almon in choo&s;ing a proper &s;ituation for her &s;pawn, the &s;tructure of the ne&s;ts of birds, their patient incubation, and the art of the cuckoo in depo&s;iting her egg in her neighbour's nur&s;ery, are in&s;tances of great &s;agacity in tho&s;e creatures: and yet they are much inferior to the arts exerted by many of the in&s;ect tribes on &s;imi|lar occa&s;ions. The hairy excre&s;cences on briars, the oak apples, the bla&s;ted leaves of trees, and the lumps on the backs of cows, are &s;itu|ations that are rather produced than cho&s;en by the mother in&s;ect for the convenience of her offspring. The cells of bees, wa&s;ps, &s;piders, and of the various coralline in&s;ects, equally a&s;toni&s;h us, whether we attend to the materials or to the architecture.</P>
<P>But the conduct of the ant, and of &s;ome &s;pecies of the ichneumon fly in the incubation of their eggs, is equal to any exertion of human &s;cience. The ants many times in a day move their eggs nearer the &s;urface of their habitation, or deeper below it, as the heat of the weather varies; and in colder days lie upon them in heaps for the purpo&s;e of incubation: if their man&s;ion is too dry, they carry them to places where there is moi&s;ture, and you may di&s;tinctly &s;ee the little worms move and &s;uck up the water. When too much moi&s;ture ap|proaches their ne&s;t, they convey their eggs deeper in the earth, or to &s;ome other place of &s;afety. (Swammerd, Epil. ad Hi&s;t. In&s;ects, p. 153. Phil. Tran&s;. No. 23. Lowthrop. V. 2. p. 7.)</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="192">
There is one &s;pecies of ichneumon-fly, that digs a hole in the earth, and carrying into it two or three living caterpillars, depo&s;its her eggs, and nicely clo&s;ing up the ne&s;t leaves them there; partly doubtle&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t the incubation, and partly to &s;upply food to her future young, (Derham. B. 4. c. 13. Ari&s;totle Hi&s;t. Animal, L. 5. c. 20.)</P>
<P>A friend of mine put about fifty large caterpillars collected from cabbages on &s;ome bran and a few leaves into a box, and covered it with gauze to prevent their e&s;cape. After a few days we &s;aw, from more than three fourths of them, about eight or ten little caterpillars of the ichneumon-fly come out of their backs, and &s;pin each a &s;mall cocoon of &s;ilk, and in a few days the large caterpillars died. This &s;mall fly it &s;eems lays its egg in the back of the cabbage caterpillar, which when hatched preys upon the material, which is produced there for the purpo&s;e of making &s;ilk for the future ne&s;t of the cabbage cater|pillar; of which being deprived, the creature wanders about till it dies, and thus our gardens are pre&s;erved by the ingenuity of this cruel fly. This curious property of producing a &s;ilk thread, which is com|mon to &s;ome &s;ea animals, &s;ee Botanic Garden, Part I. Note XXVII. and is de&s;igned for the purpo&s;e of their transformation as in the &s;ilk|worm, is u&s;ed for conveying them&s;elves from higher branches to lower ones of trees by &s;ome caterpillars, and to make them&s;elves temporary ne&s;ts or tents, and by the &s;pider for entangling his prey. Nor is it &s;trange that &s;o much knowledge &s;hould be acquired by &s;uch &s;mall ani|mals; &s;ince there is rea&s;on to imagine, that the&s;e in&s;ects have the &s;en&s;e of touch, either in their probo&s;cis, or their antennae, to a great degree of perfection; and thence may po&s;&s;e&s;s, as far as their &s;phere extends, as accurate knowledge, and as &s;ubtle invention, as the di&s;coverers of human arts.</P>

<P N="1">XVI. 1. If we were better acquainted with the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e in&s;ects that are formed into &s;ocieties, as the bees, wa&s;ps, and ants, I make no doubt but we &s;hould find, that their arts and improvements are not &s;o &s;imilar and uniform as they now appear to us, but that they
<PB N="179" REF="193">
aro&s;e in the &s;ame manner from experience and tradition, as the arts of our own &s;pecies; though their rea&s;oning is from fewer ideas, is bu&s;ied about fewer objects, and is exerted with le&s;s energy.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome kinds of in&s;ects that migrate like the birds before mentioned. The locu&s;t of warmer climates has &s;ometimes come over to England; it is &s;haped like a gra&s;shopper, with very large wings, and a body above an inch in length. It is mentioned as coming into Egypt with an ea&s;t wind, "The Lord brought an ea&s;t wind upon the land all that day and night, and in the morning the ea&s;t wind brought the locu&s;ts, and covered the face of the earth, &s;o that the land was dark," Exod. x. 13. The migrations of the&s;e in&s;ects are mentioned in another part of the &s;cripture, "The locu&s;ts have no king, yet go they forth all of them in bands," Prov. xxx. 27.</P>
<P>The accurate Mr. Adan&s;on, near the river Gambia in Africa, was witne&s;s to the migration of the&s;e in&s;ects. "About eight in the morning, in the month of February, there &s;uddenly aro&s;e over our heads a thick cloud, which darkened the air, and deprived us of the rays of the &s;un. We found it was a cloud of locu&s;ts rai&s;ed about twenty or thirty fathoms from the ground, and covering an extent of &s;everal leagues; at length a &s;hower of the&s;e in&s;ects de&s;cended, and after devouring every green herb, while they re&s;ted, again re&s;umed their flight. This cloud was brought by a &s;trong ea&s;t-wind, and was all the morning in pa&s;&s;ing over the adjacent country." (Voyage to Senegal, 158.)</P>
<P>In this country the gnats are &s;ometimes &s;een to migrate in clouds, like the mu&s;ketoes of warmer climates, and our &s;warms of bees fre|quently travel many miles, and are &s;aid in North America always to fly towards the &s;outh. The prophet I&s;aiah has a beautiful allu&s;ion to the&s;e migrations, "The Lord &s;hall call the fly from the rivers of Egypt, and &s;hall hi&s;s for the bee that is in the land of A&s;&s;yria," I&s;a. vii. 18. which has been lately explained by Mr. Bruce, in his tra|vels to di&s;cover the &s;ource of the Nile.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="180" REF="194">
2. I am well informed that the bees that were carried into Barba|does, and other we&s;tern i&s;lands, cea&s;ed to lay up any honey after the fir&s;t year, as they found it not u&s;eful to them: and are now become very trouble&s;ome to the inhabitants of tho&s;e i&s;lands by infe&s;ting their &s;ugar|hou&s;es; but tho&s;e in Jamaica continue to make honey, as the cold north winds, or rainy &s;ea&s;ons of that i&s;land, confine them at home for &s;everal weeks together. And the bees of Senegal, which differ from tho&s;e of Europe only in &s;ize, make their honey not only &s;uperior to ours in delicacy of flavour, but it has this &s;ingularity, that it never concretes, but remains liquid as &s;yrup, (Adan&s;on). From &s;ome ob&s;ervations of Mr. Wildman, and of other people of veracity, it ap|pears, that during the &s;evere part of the winter &s;ea&s;on for weeks to|gether the bees are quite benumbed and torpid from the cold, and do not con&s;ume any of their provi&s;ion. This &s;tate of &s;leep, like that of &s;wallows and bats, &s;eems to be the natural re&s;ource of tho&s;e creatures in cold climates, and the making of honey to be an artificial improve|ment.</P>
<P>As the death of our hives of bees appears to be owing to their being kept &s;o warm, as to require food when their &s;tock is exhau&s;ted; a very ob&s;erving gentleman at my reque&s;t put two hives for many weeks into a dry cellar, and ob&s;erved, during all that time, they did not con&s;ume any of their provi&s;ion, for their weight did not decrea&s;e, as it had done when they were kept in the open air. The &s;ame ob|&s;ervation is made in the Annual Regi&s;ter for 1768, p. 113. And the Rev. Mr. White, in his Method of pre&s;erving Bees, adds, that tho&s;e on the north &s;ide of his hou&s;e con&s;umed le&s;s honey in the winter than tho&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide.</P>
<P>There is another ob&s;ervation on bees well a&s;certained, that they at various times, when the &s;ea&s;on begins to be cold, by a general mo|tion of their legs as they hang in clu&s;ters produce a degree of warmth, which is ea&s;ily perceptible by the hand. Hence by this ingenious ex|ertion,
<PB N="181" REF="195">
they for a long time prevent the torpid &s;tate they would na|turally fall into.</P>
<P>According to the late ob&s;ervations of Mr. Hunter, it appears that the bee's-wax is not made from the du&s;t of the anthers of flowers, which they bring home on their thighs, but that this makes what is termed bee-bread, and is u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of feeding the bee-mag|gots; in the &s;ame manner butterflies live on honey, but the previous caterpillar lives on vegetable leaves, while the maggots of large flies require fle&s;h for their food, and tho&s;e of the ichneumon fly require in&s;ects for their food. What induces the bee who lives on honey to lay up vegetable powder for its young? What induces the butterfly to lay its eggs on leaves, when it&s;elf feeds on honey? What induces the other flies to &s;eek a food for their progeny different from what they con&s;ume them&s;elves? If the&s;e are not deductions from their own previous experience or ob&s;ervation, all the actions of mankind mu&s;t be re&s;olved into in&s;tinct.</P>
<P N="3">3. The dormou&s;e con&s;umes but little of its food during the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, for they roll them&s;elves up, or &s;leep, or lie torpid the greate&s;t part of the time; but on warm &s;unny days experience a &s;hort revival, and take a little food, and then relap&s;e into their former &s;tate." (Pennant Zoolog. p. 67.) Other animals, that &s;leep in winter without laying up any provender, are ob&s;erved to go into their winter beds fat and &s;trong, but return to day-light in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on very lean and feeble. The common flies &s;leep during the winter without any provi&s;ion for their nouri&s;hment, and are daily revived by the warmth of the &s;un, or of our fires. The&s;e whenever they &s;ee light endeavour to approach it, having ob&s;erved, that by its greater vicinity they get free from the degree of torpor, that the cold produces; and are hence induced perpetually to burn them&s;elves in our candles: de|ceived, like mankind, by the mi&s;application of their knowledge. Whil&s;t many of the &s;ubterraneous in&s;ects, as the common worms, &s;eem to retreat &s;o deep into the earth as not to be enlivened or awak|ened

by the difference of our winter days; and &s;top up their holes with leaves or &s;traws, to prevent the fro&s;ts from injuring them, or the centipes from devouring them. The habits of peace, or the &s;tra|tagems of war, of the&s;e &s;ubterranean nations are covered from our view; but a friend of mine prevailed on a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed worm to enter the hole of another worm on a bowling-green, and he pre&s;ently re|turned much wounded about his head. And I once &s;aw a worm ri&s;e ha&s;tily out of the earth into the &s;un&s;hine, and ob&s;erved a centipes hanging at its tail; the centipes nimbly quitted the tail, and &s;eizing the worm about its middle cut it in half with its forceps, and preyed upon one part, while the other e&s;caped.

The wa&s;p of this country fixes his habitation under ground, that he may not be affected with the various changes of our climate; but in Jamaica he hangs it on the bough of a tree, where the &s;ea&s;ons are le&s;s &s;evere. He weaves a very curious paper of vegetable fibres to cover his ne&s;t, which is con&s;tructed on the &s;ame principle with that of the bee, but with a different material; but as his prey con&s;i&s;ts of fle&s;h, fruits, and in&s;ects, which are peri&s;hable commodities, he can lay up no provender for the winter.</P>
<P>M. de la Loubiere, in his relation of Siam, &s;ays, "That in a part of that kingdom, which lies open to great inundations, all the ants make their &s;ettlements upon trees; no ants' ne&s;ts are to be &s;een any where el&s;e." Whereas in our country the ground is their only &s;itu|ation. From the &s;criptural account of the&s;e in&s;ects, one might be led to &s;u&s;pect, that in &s;ome climates they lay up a provi&s;ion for the winter. Origen affirms the &s;ame, (Cont. Cel&s;. L. 4.) But it is gene|rally believed that in this country they do not, (Prov. vi. 6. xxx. 25.) The white ants of the coa&s;t of Africa make them&s;elves pyramids eight or ten feet high, on a ba&s;e of about the &s;ame width, with a &s;mooth &s;urface of rich clay, exce&s;&s;ively hard and well built, which appear at a di&s;tance like an a&s;&s;emblage of the huts of the negroes, (Adan&s;on).

<HEAD>THE CATENATION OF MOTIONS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>I. 1. Catenations of animal motion. 2. Are produced by irritations, by &s;en&s;ations, by volitions. 3. They continue &s;ome time after they have been excited. Cau&s;e of catenation. 4. We can then exert our attention on other objects. 5. Many catenations of motions go on together. 6. Some links of the catenations of motions may be left out without di&s;uniting the chain. 7. Interrupted circles of motion continue confu&s;edly till they come to the part of the circle, where they were di&s;|turbed. 8. Weaker catenations are di&s;&s;evered by &s;tronger. 9. Then new cate|nations take place. 10. Much effort prevents their reuniting. Impediment of &s;peech. 11. Trains more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;evered than circles. 12. Sleep de&s;troys vo|lition and external &s;timulus. II. In&s;tances of various catenations in a young lady playing on the harp&s;ichord. III. 1. What catenations are the &s;tronge&s;t. 2. Irritations joined with a&s;&s;ociations form &s;tronge&s;t connexions. Vital motions. 3. New links with increa&s;ed force, cold fits of fever produced. 4. New links with decrea&s;ed force. Cold bath. 5. Irritation joined with &s;en&s;ation. Inflam|matory fever. Why children cannot tickle them&s;elves. 6. Volition joined with &s;en&s;ation.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. TO inve&s;tigate with preci&s;ion the catenations of animal mo|tions, it would be well to attend to the manner of their production; but we cannot begin this di&s;qui&s;ition early enough for this purpo&s;e, as the catenations of motion &s;eem to begin with life, and are only ex|tingui&s;hable with it. We have &s;poken of the power of irritation, of &s;en&s;ation, of volition, and of a&s;&s;ociation, as preceding the fibrous
<PB N="186" REF="200">
motions; we now &s;tep forwards, and con&s;ider, that conver&s;ely they are in their turn preceded by tho&s;e motions; and that all the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive trains or circles of our actions are compo&s;ed of this twofold concatenation. Tho&s;e we &s;hall call trains of action, which continue to proceed without any &s;tated repetitions; and tho&s;e circles of action, when the parts of them return at certain periods, though the trains, of which they con&s;i&s;t, are not exactly &s;imilar. The reading an epic poem is a train of actions; the reading a &s;ong with a chorus at equal di&s;tances in the mea&s;ure con&s;titutes &s;o many circles of action.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some catenations of animal motion are produced by reiterated &s;ucce&s;&s;ive irritations, as when we learn to repeat the alphabet in its order by frequently reading the letters of it. Thus the vermicular motions of the bowels were originally produced by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ir|ritations of the pa&s;&s;ing aliment; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of actions of the auricles and ventricles of the heart was originally formed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus of the blood, the&s;e afterwards become part of the diurnal cir|cles of animal actions, as appears by the periodical returns of hunger, and the quickened pul&s;e of weak people in the evening.</P>
<P>Other catenations of animal motion are gradually acquired by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive agreeable &s;en&s;ations, as in learning a favourite &s;ong or dance; others by di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, as in coughing or nictitation; the&s;e become a&s;&s;ociated by frequent repetition, and afterwards compo&s;e parts of greater circles of action like tho&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>Other catenations of motions are gradually acquired by frequent vo|luntary repetitions; as when we deliberately learn to march, read, fence, or any mechanic art, the motions of many of our mu&s;cles be|come gradually linked together in trains, tribes, or circles of action. Thus when any one at fir&s;t begins to u&s;e the tools in turning wood or metals in a lathe, he wills the motions of his hand or fingers, till at length the&s;e actions become &s;o connected with the effect, that he &s;eems only to will the point of the chi&s;&s;el. The&s;e are cau&s;ed by vo|lition,
<PB N="187" REF="201">
connected by a&s;&s;ociation like tho&s;e above de&s;cribed, and after|wards become parts of our diurnal trains or circles of action.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the&s;e catenations of animal motions are liable to proceed &s;ome time after they are excited, unle&s;s they are di&s;turbed or impeded by other irritations, &s;en&s;ations, or volitions; and in many in&s;tances in &s;pite of our endeavours to &s;top them; and this property of animal motions is probably the cau&s;e of their catenation. Thus when a child revolves &s;ome minutes on one foot, the &s;pectra of the ambient objects appear to circulate round him &s;ome time after he falls upon the ground. Thus the palpitation of the heart continues &s;ome time after the object of fear, which occa&s;ioned it, is removed. The blu&s;h of &s;hame, which is an exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, and the glow of anger, which is an exce&s;s of volition, continue &s;ome time, though the affected per|&s;on finds, that tho&s;e emotions were cau&s;ed by mi&s;taken facts, and en|deavours to extingui&s;h their appearance. See Sect. XII. 1. 5.</P>
<P N="4">4. When a circle of motions becomes connected by frequent repe|titions as above, we can exert our attention &s;trongly on other objects, and the concatenated circle of motions will neverthele&s;s proceed in due order; as whil&s;t you are thinking on this &s;ubject, you u&s;e variety of mu&s;cles in walking about your parlour, or in &s;itting at your writ|ing-table.</P>
<P N="5">5. Innumerable catenations of motions may proceed at the &s;ame time, without incommoding each other. Of the&s;e are the motions of the heart and arteries; tho&s;e of dige&s;tion and glandular &s;ecretion; of the ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions; tho&s;e of progre&s;&s;ion, and of &s;peak|ing; the great annual circle of actions &s;o apparent in birds in their times of breeding and moulting; the monthly circles of many female animals; and the diurnal circles of &s;leeping and waking, of fulne&s;s and inanition.</P>
<P N="6">6. Some links of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains or of &s;ynchronous tribes of action may be left out without disjoining the whole. Such are our u&s;ual trains of recollection; after having travelled through an entertaining
<PB N="188" REF="202">
country, and viewed many delightful lawns, rolling rivers, and echo|ing rocks; in the recollection of our journey we leave out the many di&s;tricts, that we cro&s;&s;ed, which were marked with no peculiar plea|&s;ure. Such al&s;o are our complex ideas, they are catenated tribes of ideas, which do not perfectly re&s;emble their corre&s;pondent perceptions, becau&s;e &s;ome of the parts are omitted.</P>
<P N="7">7. If an interrupted circle of actions is not entirely di&s;&s;evered, it will continue to proceed confu&s;edly, till it comes to the part of the circle, where it was interrupted.</P>
<P>The vital motions in a fever from drunkenne&s;s, and in other peri|odical di&s;ea&s;es, are in&s;tances of this circum&s;tance. The accidental in|ebriate does not recover him&s;elf perfectly till about the &s;ame hour on the &s;ucceeding day. The accu&s;tomed drunkard is di&s;ordered, if he has not his u&s;ual potation of fermented liquor. So if a con&s;iderable part of a connected tribe of action be di&s;turbed, that whole tribe goes on with confu&s;ion, till the part of the tribe affected regains its ac|cu&s;tomed catenations. So vertigo produces vomiting, and a great &s;e|cretion of bile, as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, all the&s;e being parts of the tribe of irritative catenations.</P>
<P N="8">8. Weaker catenated trains may be di&s;&s;evered by the &s;udden ex|ertion of the &s;tronger. When a child fir&s;t attempts to walk acro&s;s a room, call to him, and he in&s;tantly falls upon the ground. So while I am thinking over the virtues of my friends, if the tea-kettle &s;purt out &s;ome hot water on my &s;tocking; the &s;udden pain breaks the weaker chain of ideas, and introduces a new group of figures of its own. This circum&s;tance is extended to &s;ome unnatural trains of ac|tion, which have not been confirmed by long habit; as the hiccough, or an ague-fit, which are frequently curable by &s;urpri&s;e. A young lady about eleven years old had for five days had a contraction of one mu&s;cle in her fore arm, and another in her arm, which occurred four or five times every minute; the mu&s;cles were &s;een to leap, but with|out bending the arm. To counteract this new morbid habit, an i&s;&s;ue
<PB N="189" REF="203">
was placed over the convul&s;ed mu&s;cle of her arm, and an adhe&s;ive pla&s;ter wrapped tight like a bandage over the whole fore arm, by which the new motions were immediately de&s;troyed, but the means were continued &s;ome weeks to prevent a return.</P>
<P N="9">9. If any circle of actions is di&s;&s;evered, either by omi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the links, as in &s;leep, or by in&s;ertion of other links, as in &s;urpri&s;e, new catenations take place in a greater or le&s;s degree. The la&s;t link of the broken chain of actions becomes connected with the new mo|tion which has broken it, or with that which was neare&s;t the link omitted; and the&s;e new catenations proceed in&s;tead of the old ones. Hence the periodic returns of ague-fits, and the chimeras of our dreams.</P>
<P N="10">10. If a train of actions is di&s;&s;evered, much effort of volition or &s;en&s;ation will prevent its being re&s;tored. Thus in the common im|pediment of &s;peech, when the a&s;&s;ociation of the motions of the mu&s;|cles of enunciation with the idea of the word to be &s;poken is di&s;or|dered, the great voluntary efforts, which di&s;tort the countenance, prevent the rejoining of the broken a&s;&s;ociations. See No. II. 10. of this Section. It is thus likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable in &s;ome inflammations of the bowels, the too &s;trong efforts made by the mu&s;cles to carry for|wards the offending material fixes it more firmly in its place, and prevents the cure. So in endeavouring to recal to our memory &s;ome particular word of a &s;entence, if we exert our&s;elves too &s;trongly about it, we are le&s;s likely to regain it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Catenated trains or tribes of action are ea&s;ier di&s;&s;evered than catenated circles of action. Hence in epileptic fits the &s;ynchronous connected tribes of action, which keep the body erect, are di&s;&s;evered, but the circle of vital motions continues undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P N="12">12. Sleep de&s;troys the power of volition, and precludes the &s;timuli of external objects, and thence di&s;&s;evers the trains, of which the&s;e are a part; which confirms the other catenations, as tho&s;e of the vital
<PB N="190" REF="204">
motions, &s;ecretions, and ab&s;orptions; and produces the new trains of ideas, which con&s;titute our dreams.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">II. 1. All the preceding circum&s;tances of the catenations of animal motions will be more clearly under&s;tood by the following example of a per&s;on learning mu&s;ic; and when we recollect the variety of me|chanic arts, which are performed by a&s;&s;ociated trains of mu&s;cular ac|tions catenated with the effects they produce, as in knitting, netting, weaving; and the greater variety of a&s;&s;ociated trains of ideas cau&s;ed or catenated by volitions or &s;en&s;ations, as in our hourly modes of rea|&s;oning, or imagining, or recollecting, we &s;hall gain &s;ome idea of the innumerable catenated trains and circles of action, which form the tenor of our lives, and which began, and will only cea&s;e entirely with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a young lady begins to learn mu&s;ic, &s;he voluntarily ap|plies her&s;elf to the characters of her mu&s;ic-book, and by many repe|titions endeavours to catenate them with the proportions of &s;ound, of which they are &s;ymbols. The ideas excited by the mu&s;ical charac|ters are &s;lowly connected with the keys of the harp&s;ichord, and much effort is nece&s;&s;ary to produce every note with the proper finger, and in its due place and time; till at length a train of voluntary exertions becomes catenated with certain irritations. As the various notes by frequent repetitions become connected in the order, in which they are produced, a new catenation of &s;en&s;itive exertions becomes mixed with the voluntary ones above de&s;cribed; and not only the mu&s;ical &s;ymbols of crotchets and quavers, but the auditory notes and tones at the &s;ame time, become &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive or &s;ynchronous links in thi&s; circle of catenated actions.</P>
<P>At length the motions of her &s;ingers become catenated with the mu&s;ical characters; and the&s;e no &s;ooner &s;trike the eye, than the finger pre&s;&s;es down the key without any voluntary attention between them; the activity of the hand being connected with the irritation of the
<PB N="191" REF="205">
figure or place of the mu&s;ical &s;ymbol on the retina; till at length by frequent repetitions of the &s;ame tune the movements of her fingers in playing, and the mu&s;cles of the larynx in &s;inging, become a&s;&s;ociated with each other, and form part of tho&s;e intricate trains and circles of catenated motions, according with the &s;econd article of the preceding propo&s;itions in No. 1. of this Section.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be&s;ides the facility, which by habit attends the execution of this mu&s;ical performance, a curious circum&s;tance occurs, which is, that when our young mu&s;ician has began a tune, &s;he finds her&s;elf in|clined to continue it; and that even when &s;he is carele&s;sly &s;inging alone without attending to her own &s;ong; according with the third preceding article.</P>
<P N="4">4. At the &s;ame time that our young performer continues to play with great exactne&s;s this accu&s;tomed tune, &s;he can bend her mind, and that inten&s;ely, on &s;ome other object, according with the fourth article of the preceding propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The manu&s;cript copy of this work was lent to many of my friends at different times for the purpo&s;e of gaining their opinions and criti|ci&s;ms on many parts of it, and I found the following anecdote writ|ten with a pencil oppo&s;ite to this page, but am not certain by whom. "I remember &s;eeing the pretty young actre&s;s, who &s;ucceeded Mrs. Arne in the performance of the celebrated Padlock, rehear&s;e the mu|&s;ical parts at her harp&s;ichord under the eye of her ma&s;ter with great ta&s;te and accuracy; though I ob&s;erved her countenance full of emo|tion, which I could not account for; at la&s;t &s;he &s;uddenly bur&s;t into tears; for &s;he had all this time been eyeing a beloved canary bird, &s;uffering great agonies, which at that in&s;tant fell dead from its perch."</P>
<P N="5">5. At the &s;ame time many other catenated circles of action are going on in the per&s;on of our fair mu&s;ician, as well as the motions of her fingers, &s;uch as the vital motions, re&s;piration, the movements of
<PB N="192" REF="206">
her eyes and eyelids, and of the intricate mu&s;cles of vocality, accord|ing with the fifth preceding article.</P>
<P N="6">6. If by any &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of our fair mu&s;ician &s;he &s;hould be interrupted for a very incon&s;iderable time, &s;he can &s;till con|tinue her performance, according to the &s;ixth article.</P>
<P N="7">7. If however this interruption be greater, though the chain of ac|tions be not di&s;&s;evered, it proceeds confu&s;edly, and our young per|former continues indeed to play, but in a hurry without accuracy and elegance, till &s;he begins the tune again, according to the &s;eventh of the preceding articles.</P>
<P N="8">8. But if this interruption be &s;till greater, the circle of actions be|comes entirely di&s;&s;evered, and &s;he finds her&s;elf immediately under the nece&s;&s;ity to begin over again to recover the lo&s;t catenation, according to the eighth preceding article.</P>
<P N="9">9. Or in trying to recover it &s;he will &s;ing &s;ome di&s;&s;onant notes, or &s;trike &s;ome improper keys, according to the ninth preceding article.</P>
<P N="10">10. A very remarkable thing attends this breach of catenation, if the performer has forgotten &s;ome word of her &s;ong, the more energy of mind &s;he u&s;es about it, the more di&s;tant is &s;he from regaining it; and artfully employs her mind in part on &s;ome other object, or endea|vours to dull its perceptions, continuing to repeat, as it were incon&s;ci|ou&s;ly, the former part of the &s;ong, that &s;he remembers, in hopes to regain the lo&s;t connexion.</P>
<P>For if the activity of the mind it&s;elf be more energetic, or takes its attention more, than the connecting word, which is wanted; it will not perceive the &s;lighter link of this lo&s;t word; as who li&s;tens to a feeble &s;ound, mu&s;t be very &s;ilent and motionle&s;s; &s;o that in this ca&s;e the very vigour of the mind it&s;elf &s;eems to prevent it from regaining the lo&s;t catenation, as well as the too great exertion in endeavouring to regain it, according to the tenth preceding article.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="207">
We frequently experience, when we are doubtful about the &s;pelling of a word, that the greater voluntary exertion we u&s;e, that is the more inten&s;ely we think about it, the further are we from regaining the lo&s;t a&s;&s;ociation between the letters of it, but which readily recurs when we have become carele&s;s about it. In the &s;ame manner, after having for an hour laboured to recollect the name of &s;ome ab&s;ent per|&s;on, it &s;hall &s;eem, particularly after &s;leep, to come into the mind as it were &s;pontaneou&s;ly; that is, the word we are in &s;earch of, was joined to the preceding one by a&s;&s;ociation; this a&s;&s;ociation being di&s;&s;evered, we endeavour to recover it by volition; this very action of the mind &s;trikes our attention more, than the faint link of a&s;&s;ociation, and we find it impo&s;&s;ible by this means to retrieve the lo&s;t word. After &s;leep, when volition is entirely &s;u&s;pended, the mind becomes capable of per|ceiving the fainter link of a&s;&s;ociation, and the word is regained.</P>
<P>On this circum&s;tance depends the impediment of &s;peech before mentioned; the fir&s;t &s;yllable of a word is cau&s;able by volition, but the remainder of it is in common conver&s;ation introduced by its a&s;&s;ocia|tions with this fir&s;t &s;yllable acquired by long habit. Hence when the mind of the &s;tammerer is vehemently employed on &s;ome idea of am|bition of &s;hining, or fear of not &s;ucceeding, the a&s;&s;ociations of the mo|tions of the mu&s;cles of articulation with each other become di&s;&s;evered by this greater exertion, and he endeavours in vain by voluntary ef|forts to rejoin the broken a&s;&s;ociation. For this purpo&s;e he continues to repeat the fir&s;t &s;yllable, which is cau&s;able by volition, and &s;trives in vain, by various di&s;tortions of countenance, to produce the next links, which are &s;ubject to a&s;&s;ociation. See Cla&s;s IV. 3. 1. 1.</P>
<P N="11">11. After our accompli&s;hed mu&s;ician has acquired great variety of tunes and &s;ongs, &s;o that &s;ome of them begin to cea&s;e to be ea&s;ily re|collected, &s;he finds progre&s;&s;ive trains of mu&s;ical notes more frequently forgotten, than tho&s;e which are compo&s;ed of reiterated circles, ac|cording with the eleventh preceding article.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="194" REF="208">
12. To fini&s;h our example with the preceding articles we mu&s;t at length &s;uppo&s;e, that our fair performer falls a&s;leep over her harp&s;i|chord; and thus by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, and the exclu&s;ion of ex|ternal &s;timuli, &s;he di&s;&s;evers the trains and circles of her mu&s;ical ex|ertions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">III. 1. Many of the&s;e circum&s;tances of catenations of motions re|ceive an ea&s;y explanation from the four following con&s;equences to the &s;eventh law of animal cau&s;ation in Sect. IV. The&s;e are, fir&s;t, that tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ions or combinations of animal motions, whether they were united by cau&s;ation, a&s;&s;ociation, or catenation, which have been mo&s;t frequently repeated, acquire the &s;tronge&s;t connection. Secondly, that of the&s;e, tho&s;e, which have been le&s;s frequently mixed with other trains or tribes of motion, have the &s;tronge&s;t connection. Thirdly, that of the&s;e, tho&s;e, which were fir&s;t formed, have the &s;tronge&s;t connection. Fourthly, that if an animal motion be excited by more than one cau&s;ation, a&s;&s;ociation, or catenation, at the &s;ame time, it will be performed with greater energy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence al&s;o we under&s;tand, why the catenations of irritative mo|tions are more &s;trongly connected than tho&s;e of the other cla&s;&s;es, where the quantity of unmixed repetition has been equal; becau&s;e they were fir&s;t formed. Such are tho&s;e of the &s;ecerning and ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els, where the action of the gland produces a fluid, which &s;timulates the mouths of its corre&s;pondent ab&s;orbents. The a&s;&s;ociated motions &s;eem to be the next mo&s;t &s;trongly united, from their frequent repetition; and where both the&s;e circum&s;tances unite, as in the vital motions, their catenations are indi&s;&s;oluble but by the de&s;truction of the animal.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where a new link has been introduced into a circle of actions by &s;ome accidental defect of &s;timulus; if that defect of &s;timulus be repeated at the &s;ame part of the circle a &s;econd or a third time, the defective motions thus produced, both by the repeated defect of &s;ti|mulus
<PB N="195" REF="209">
and by their catenation with the parts of the circle of actions, will be performed with le&s;s and le&s;s energy. Thus if any per&s;on is expo&s;ed to cold at a certain hour to-day, &s;o long as to render &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem for a time torpid; and is again expo&s;ed to it at the &s;ame hour to-morrow, and the next day; he will be more and more affected by it, till at length a cold fit of fever is completely formed, as happens at the beginning of many of tho&s;e fevers, which are called nervous or low fevers. Where the patient has &s;light periodical &s;hiver|ings and palene&s;s for many days before the febrile paroxi&s;m is com|pletely formed.</P>
<P N="4">4. On the contrary, if the expo&s;ure to cold be for &s;o &s;hort a time, as not to induce any con&s;iderable degree of torpor or quie&s;cence, and is repeated daily as above mentioned, it lo&s;es its effect more and more at every repetition, till the con&s;titution can bear it without inconveni|ence, or indeed without being con&s;cious of it. As in walking into the cold air in for&s;ty weather. The &s;ame rule is applicable to increa&s;ed &s;timulus, as of heat, or of vinous &s;pirit, within certain limits, as is applied in the two la&s;t paragraphs to Deficient Stimulus, as is further explained in Sect.

Where irritation coincides with &s;en&s;ation to produce the &s;ame catenations of motion, as in inflammatory fevers, they are excited with &s;till greater energy than by the irritation alone. So when chil|dren expect to be tickled in play, by a feather lightly pa&s;&s;ed over the lips, or by gently vellicating the &s;oles of their feet, laughter is mo&s;t vehemently excited; though they can &s;timulate the&s;e parts with their own fingers unmoved. Here the plea&s;ureable idea of playfulne&s;s co|incides with the vellication; and there is no voluntary exertion u&s;ed to dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;ation, as there would be, if a child &s;hould endea|vour to tickle him&s;elf. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. And la&s;tly, the motions excited by the junction of voluntary exertion with irritation are performed with more energy, than tho&s;e
<PB N="196" REF="210">
by irritation &s;ingly; as when we li&s;ten to &s;mall noi&s;es, as to the tick|ing of a watch in the night, we perceive the mo&s;t weak &s;ounds, that are at other times unheeded. So when we attend to the irritative ideas of &s;ound in our ears, which are generally not attended to, we can hear them; and can &s;ee the &s;pectra of objects, which remain in the eye, whenever we plea&s;e to exert our voluntary power in aid of tho&s;e weak actions of the retina, or of the auditory nerve.</P>
<P N="7">7. The temporary catenations of ideas, which are cau&s;ed by the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure or pain, are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;evered either by irritations, as when a &s;udden noi&s;e di&s;turbs a day-dream; or by the power of vo|lition, as when we awake from &s;leep. Hence in our waking hours, whenever an idea occurs, which is incongruous to our former expe|rience, we in&s;tantly di&s;&s;ever the train of imagination by the power of volition, and compare the incongruous idea with our previous knowledge of nature, and reject it. This operation of the mind has not yet acquired a &s;pecific name, though it is exerted every minute of our waking hours; unle&s;s it may be termed INTUITIVE ANA|LOGY. It is an act of rea&s;oning of which we are uncon&s;cious except from its effects in pre&s;erving the congruity of our ideas, and bears the &s;ame relation to the &s;en&s;orial power of volition, that irritative ideas, of which we are incon&s;cious except by their effects, do to the &s;en&s;o|rial power of irritation; as the former is produced by volition without our attention to it, and the latter by irritation without our attention to them.</P>
<P>If on the other hand a train of imagination or of voluntary ideas are excited with great energy, and pa&s;&s;ing on with great vivacity, and be|come di&s;&s;evered by &s;ome violent &s;timulus, as the di&s;charge of a pi&s;tol near one's ear, another circum&s;tance takes place, which is termed SURPRISE; which by exciting violent irritation, and violent &s;en&s;ation, employs for a time the whole &s;en&s;orial energy, and thus di&s;&s;evers the pa&s;&s;ing trains of ideas, before the power of volition has time to com|pare
<PB N="197" REF="211">
them with the u&s;ual phenomena of nature. In this ca&s;e fear is generally the companion of &s;urpri&s;e, and adds to our embarra&s;&s;ment, as every one experiences in &s;ome degree when he hears a noi&s;e in the dark, which he cannot in&s;tantly account for. This catenation of fear with &s;urpri&s;e is owing to our perpetual experience of injuries from external bodies in motion, unle&s;s we are upon our guard again&s;t them. See Sect. XVIII. 17. and XIX. 2.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THERE are four &s;ituations of our &s;y&s;tem, which in their mo|derate degrees are not u&s;ually termed di&s;ea&s;es, and yet abound with many very curious and in&s;tructive phenomena; the&s;e are &s;leep, re|verie,
<PB N="199" REF="213">
vertigo, drunkenne&s;s. The&s;e we &s;hall previou&s;ly con&s;ider, before we &s;tep forwards to develop the cau&s;es and cures of di&s;ea&s;es with the modes of the operation of medicines.</P>
<P>As all tho&s;e trains and tribes of animal motion, which are &s;ubjected to volition, were the la&s;t that were cau&s;ed, their connection is weaker than that of the other cla&s;&s;es; and there is a peculiar circum&s;tance at|tending this cau&s;ation, which is, that it is entirely &s;u&s;pended during &s;leep; whil&s;t the other cla&s;&s;es of motion, which are more immediate|ly nece&s;&s;ary to life, as tho&s;e cau&s;ed by internal &s;timuli, for in&s;tance the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries, or tho&s;e catenated with plea|&s;urable &s;en&s;ation, as the powers of dige&s;tion, continue to &s;trengthen their habits without interruption. Thus though man in his &s;leeping &s;tate is a much le&s;s perfect animal, than in his waking hours; and though he con&s;umes more than one third of his life in this his irra|tional &s;ituation; yet is the wi&s;dom of the Author of nature manife&s;t even in this &s;eeming imperfection of his work!</P>
<P>The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion with re&s;pect to the large mu&s;cles of the body, which are concerned in locomotion, is evident; as no one in perfect &s;anity walks about in his &s;leep, or performs any dome&s;tic of|fices: and in re&s;pect to the mind, we never exerci&s;e our rea&s;on or re|collection in dreams; we may &s;ometimes &s;eem di&s;tracted between con|tending pa&s;&s;ions, but we never compare their objects, or deliberate about the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e objects, if our &s;leep is perfect. And though many &s;ynchronous tribes or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains of ideas may re|pre&s;ent the hou&s;es or walks, which have real exi&s;tence, yet are they here introduced by their connection with our &s;en&s;ations, and are in truth ideas of imagination, not of recollection.</P>
<P N="2">2. For our &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure and pain are experienced with great vivacity in our dreams; and hence all that motley group of ideas, which are cau&s;ed by them, called the ideas of imagination, with their various a&s;&s;ociated trains, are in a very vivid manner acted over in the &s;en&s;orium; and the&s;e &s;ometimes call into action the larger mu&s;cles,
<PB N="200" REF="214">
which have been much a&s;&s;ociated with them; as appears from the muttering &s;entences, which &s;ome people utter in their dreams, and from the ob&s;cure barking of &s;leeping dogs, and the motions of their feet and no&s;trils.</P>
<P>This perpetual flow of the trains of ideas, which con&s;titute our dreams, and which are cau&s;ed by painful or plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, might at fir&s;t view be conceived to be an u&s;ele&s;s expenditure of &s;en|&s;orial power. But it has been &s;hewn, that tho&s;e motions, which are perpetually excited, as tho&s;e of the arterial &s;y&s;tem by the &s;timulus of the blood, are attended by a great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, after they have been for a time &s;u&s;pended; as the hot-fit of fever is the con&s;equence of the cold one. Now as the&s;e trains of ideas cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation are perpetually excited during our waking hours, if they were to be &s;u&s;pended in &s;leep like the voluntary motions, (which are exerted only by intervals during our waking hours,) an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power would follow; and on our awaking a delirium would &s;upervene, &s;ince the&s;e ideas cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation would be pro|duced with &s;uch energy, that we &s;hould mi&s;take the trains of ima|gination for ideas excited by irritation; as perpetually happens to people debilitated by fevers on their fir&s;t awaking; for in the&s;e fevers with debility the general quantity of irritation being dimini&s;hed, that of &s;en&s;ation is increa&s;ed. In like manner if the actions of the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and various glands, which are perhaps in part at lea&s;t cau&s;ed by or catenated with agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and which perpetual|ly exi&s;t during our waking hours, were like the voluntary motions &s;u&s;pended in our &s;leep; the great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, which would nece&s;&s;arily follow, would be liable to excite inflamma|tion in them.</P>
<P N="3">3. When by our continued po&s;ture in &s;leep, &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions are produced, we either gradually awake by the exertion of vo|lition, or the mu&s;cles connected by habit with &s;uch &s;en&s;ations alter the po&s;ition of the body; but where the &s;leep is uncommonly pro|found,
<PB N="201" REF="215">
and tho&s;e unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations great, the di&s;ea&s;e called the incu|bus, or nightmare, is produced. Here the de&s;ire of moving the body is painfully exerted, but the power of moving it, or volition, is incapable of action, till we awake. Many le&s;s di&s;agreeable &s;truggles in our dreams, as when we wi&s;h in vain to fly from terrifying objects, con&s;titute a &s;lighter degree of this di&s;ea&s;e. In awaking from the nightmare I have more than once ob&s;erved, that there was no di&s;order in my pul&s;e; nor do I believe the re&s;piration is laborious, as &s;ome have affirmed. It occurs to people who&s;e &s;leep is too profound, and &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ts, which at other times would have awakened them, and have thence prevented the di&s;ea&s;e of nightmare; as after great fatigue or hunger with too large a &s;upper and wine, which occa&s;ion our &s;leep to be uncommonly profound. See No. 14, of this Section.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the larger mu&s;cles of the body are much more frequently excited by volition than by &s;en&s;ation, they are but &s;eldom brought into action in our &s;leep: but the ideas of the mind are by habit much more frequently connected with &s;en&s;ation than with volition; and hence the cea&s;ele&s;s flow of our ideas in dreams. Every one's experi|ence will teach him this truth, for we all daily exert much voluntary mu&s;cular motion: but few of mankind can bear the fatigue of much voluntary thinking.</P>
<P N="5">5. A very curious circum&s;tance attending the&s;e our &s;leeping ima|ginations is, that we &s;eem to receive them by the &s;en&s;es. The mu&s;|cles, which are &s;ub&s;ervient to the external organs of &s;en&s;e, are con|nected with volition, and cea&s;e to act in &s;leep; hence the eyelids are clo&s;ed, and the tympanum of the ear relaxed; and it is probable a &s;imilarity of voluntary exertion may be nece&s;&s;ary for the perceptions of the other nerves of &s;en&s;e; for it is ob&s;erved that the papillae of the tongue can be &s;een to become erected, when we attempt to ta&s;te any thing extremely grateful. Hew&s;on Exper. Enquir. V. 2. 186. Albini Annot. Acad. L. i. c. 15. Add to this, that the immediate organs
<PB N="202" REF="216">
of &s;en&s;e have no objects to excite them in the darkne&s;s and &s;ilence of the night; but their nerves of &s;en&s;e neverthele&s;s continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s their perfect activity &s;ub&s;ervient to all their numerous &s;en&s;itive con|nections. This vivacity of our nerves of &s;en&s;e during the time of &s;leep is evinced by a circum&s;tance, which almo&s;t every one mu&s;t at &s;ome time or other have experienced; that is, if we &s;leep in the day|light, and endeavour to &s;ee &s;ome object in our dream, the light is ex|ceedingly painful to our eyes; and after repeated &s;truggles we lament in our &s;leep, that we cannot &s;ee it. In this ca&s;e I apprehend the eye|lid is in &s;ome degree opened by the vehemence of our &s;en&s;ations; and, the iris being dilated, the optic nerve &s;hews as great or greater &s;en|&s;ibility than in our waking hours. See No. 15. of this Section.</P>
<P>When we are forcibly waked at midnight from profound &s;leep, our eyes are much dazzled with the light of the candle for a minute or two, after there has been &s;ufficient time allowed for the contraction of the iris; which is owing to the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the organ of vi&s;ion during its &s;tate of le&s;s activity. But when we have dreamt much of vi&s;ible objects, this accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the organ of vi&s;ion is le&s;&s;ened or prevented, and we awake in the morning without being dazzled with the light, after the iris has had time to contract it&s;elf. This is a matter of great curio&s;ity, and may be thus tried by any one in the day-light. Clo&s;e your eyes, and cover them with your hat; think for a minute on a tune, which you are accu&s;tomed to, and endeavour to &s;ing it with as little activity of mind as po&s;&s;ible. Suddenly uncover and open your eyes, and in one &s;econd of time the iris will contract it&s;elf, but you will perceive the day more luminous for &s;everal &s;econds, owing to the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the optic nerve.</P>
<P>Then again clo&s;e and cover your eyes, and think inten&s;ely on a cube of ivory two inches diameter, attending fir&s;t to the north and &s;outh &s;ides of it, and then to the other four &s;ides of it; then get a clear image in your mind's eye of all the &s;ides of the &s;ame cube co|loured
<PB N="203" REF="217">
red; and then of it coloured green; and then of it coloured blue; la&s;tly, open your eyes as in the former experiment, and after the fir&s;t &s;econd of time allowed for the contraction of the iris, you will not perceive any increa&s;e of the light of the day, or dazzling; becau&s;e now there is no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the optic nerve; that having been expended by its action in thinking over vi|&s;ible objects.</P>
<P>This experiment is not ea&s;y to be made at fir&s;t, but by a few pa|tient trials the fact appears very certain; and &s;hews clearly, that our ideas of imagination are repetitions of the motions of the nerve, which were originally occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of external bodies; becau&s;e they equally expend the &s;en&s;orial power in the organ of &s;en&s;e. See Sect. III. 4. which is analogous to our being as much fatigued by thinking as by labour.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor is it in our dreams alone, but even in our waking reveries, and in great efforts of invention, &s;o great is the vivacity of our ideas, that we do not for a time di&s;tingui&s;h them from the real pre&s;ence of &s;ub&s;tantial objects; though the external organs of &s;en&s;e are open, and &s;urrounded with their u&s;ual &s;timuli. Thus whil&s;t I am thinking over the beautiful valley, through which I ye&s;terday travelled, I do not perceive the furniture of my room: and there are &s;ome, who&s;e wak|ing imaginations are &s;o apt to run into perfect reverie, that in their common attention to a favourite idea they do not hear the voice of the companion, who acco&s;ts them, unle&s;s it is repeated with unu&s;ual energy.</P>
<P>This perpetual mi&s;take in dreams and reveries, where our ideas of imagination are attended with a belief of the pre&s;ence of external ob|jects, evinces beyond a doubt, that all our ideas are repetitions of the motions of the nerves of &s;en&s;e, by which they were acquired; and that this belief is not, as &s;ome late philo&s;ophers contend, an in&s;tinct nece&s;&s;arily connected only with our perceptions.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="204" REF="218">
7. A curious que&s;tion demands our attention in this place; as we do not di&s;tingui&s;h in our dreams and reveries between our perceptions of external objects, and our ideas of them in their ab&s;ence, how do we di&s;tingui&s;h them at any time? In a dream, if the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ugar occurs to my imagination, the whitene&s;s and hardne&s;s of it, which were ideas u&s;ually connected with the &s;weetne&s;s, immediately follow in the train; and I believe a material lump of &s;ugar pre&s;ent before my &s;en&s;es: but in my waking hours, if the &s;weetne&s;s occurs to my imagination, the &s;timulus of the table to my hand, or of the window to my eye, prevents the other ideas of the hardne&s;s and whitene&s;s of the &s;ugar from &s;ucceeding; and hence I perceive the fallacy, and di&s;believe the exi&s;tence of objects corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e ideas, who&s;e tribes or trains are broken by the &s;timulus of other ob|jects. And further in our waking hours, we frequently exert our volition in comparing prefent appearances with &s;uch, as we have u&s;ually ob&s;erved; and thus correct the errors of one &s;en&s;e by our ge|neral knowledge of nature by intuitive analogy. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7. Whereas in dreams the power of volition is &s;u&s;pended, we can recollect and compare our pre&s;ent ideas with none of our acquired knowledge, and are hence incapable of ob&s;erving any ab&s;urdities in them.</P>
<P>By this criterion we di&s;tingui&s;h our waking from our &s;leeping hours, we can voluntarily recollect our &s;leeping ideas, when we are awake, and compare them with our waking ones; but we cannot in our &s;leep <HI>voluntarily</HI> recollect our waking ideas at all.</P>
<P N="8">8. The va&s;t variety of &s;cenery, novelty of combination, and di&s;|tinctne&s;s of imagery, are other curious circum&s;tances of our &s;leeping imaginations. The variety of &s;cenery &s;eems to ari&s;e from the &s;upe|rior activity and excellence of our &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion; which in an in&s;tant unfolds to the mind exten&s;ive fields of plea&s;urable ideas; while the other &s;en&s;es collect their objects &s;lowly, and with little combination;
<PB N="205" REF="219">
add to this, that the ideas, which this organ pre&s;ents us with, are more frequently connected with our &s;en&s;ation than tho&s;e of any other.</P>
<P N="9">9. The great novelty of combination is owing to another circum|&s;tance; the trains of ideas, which are carried on in our waking thoughts, are in our dreams di&s;&s;evered in a thou&s;and places by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, and the ab&s;ence of irritative ideas, and are hence perpetually falling into new catenations. As explained in Sect. XVI. 1. 9. For the power of volition is perpetually exerted during our waking hours in comparing our pa&s;&s;ing trains of ideas with our acquired knowledge of nature, and thus forms many intermediate links in their catenation. And the irritative ideas excited by the &s;timulus of the objects, with which we are &s;urrounded, are every moment in|truded upon us, and form other links of our uncea&s;ing catenations of ideas.</P>
<P N="10">10. The ab&s;ence of the &s;timuli of external bodies, and of volition, in our dreams renders the organs of &s;en&s;e liable to be more &s;trongly af|fected by the powers of &s;en&s;ation, and of a&s;&s;ociation. For our de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, or the obtru&s;ions of &s;urrounding bodies, di&s;&s;ever the &s;en&s;itive and a&s;&s;ociate tribes of ideas in our waking hours by intro|ducing tho&s;e of irritation and volition among&s;t them. Hence pro|ceeds the &s;uperior di&s;tinctne&s;s of plea&s;ureable or painful imagery in our &s;leep; for we recal the figure and the features of a long lo&s;t friend, whom we loved, in our dreams with much more accuracy and viva|city than in our waking thoughts. This circum&s;tance contributes to prove, that our ideas of imagination are reiterations of tho&s;e motions of our organs of &s;en&s;e, which were excited by external objects; be|cau&s;e while we are expo&s;ed to the &s;timuli of pre&s;ent objects, our ideas of ab&s;ent objects cannot be &s;o di&s;tinctly formed.</P>
<P N="11">11. The rapidity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tran&s;actions in our dreams is almo&s;t inconceivable; in&s;omuch that, when we are accidentally awakened by the jarring of a door, which is opened into our bed|chamber,
<PB N="206" REF="220">
we &s;ometimes dream a whole hi&s;tory of thieves or fire in the very in&s;tant of awaking.</P>
<P>During the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition we cannot compare our other ideas with tho&s;e of the parts of time in which they exi&s;t; that is, we cannot compare the imaginary &s;cene, which is before us, with tho&s;e changes of it, which precede or follow it; becau&s;e this act of com|paring requires recollection or voluntary exertion. Whereas in our waking hours, we are perpetually making this compari&s;on, and by that means our waking ideas are kept con&s;i&s;tent with each other by intuitive analogy; but this compari&s;on retards the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them, by occa&s;ioning their repetition. Add to this, that the tran&s;actions of our dreams con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vi&s;ible ideas, and that a whole hi&s;tory of thieves and fire may be <HI>beheld</HI> in an in&s;tant of time like the figures in a picture.</P>
<P N="12">12. From this incapacity of attending to the parts of time in our dreams, ari&s;es our ignorance of the length of the night; which, but from our con&s;tant experience to the contrary, we &s;hould conclude was but a few minutes, when our &s;leep is perfect. The &s;ame happens in our reveries; thus when we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with vehement joy, grief, or anger, time appears &s;hort, for we exert no volition to compare the pre&s;ent &s;cenery with the pa&s;t or future; but when we are compelled to perform tho&s;e exerci&s;es of mind or body, which are unmixed with pa&s;&s;ion, as in travelling over a dreary country, time appears long; for our de&s;ire to fini&s;h our journey occa&s;ions us more frequently to compare our pre&s;ent &s;ituation with the parts of time or place, which are before and behind us.</P>
<P>So when we are enveloped in deep contemplation of any kind, or in reverie, as in reading a very intere&s;ting play or romance, we mea|&s;ure time very inaccurately; and hence, if a play greatly affects our pa&s;&s;ions, the ab&s;urdities of pa&s;&s;ing over many days or years, and of perpetual changes of place, are not perceived by the audience; as is experienced by every one, who reads or &s;ees &s;ome plays of the im|mortal
<PB N="207" REF="221">
Shake&s;pear; but it is nece&s;&s;ary for inferior authors to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rules of the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> inculcated by Ari&s;totle, becau&s;e their works do not intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ufficiently to produce com|plete reverie.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e works, however, whether a romance or a &s;ermon, which do not intere&s;t us &s;o much as to induce reverie, may neverthele&s;s in|cline us to &s;leep. For tho&s;e plea&s;ureable ideas, which are pre&s;ented to us, and are too gentle to excite laughter, (which is attended with in|terrupted voluntary exertions, as explained Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.) and which are not accompanied with any other emotion, which u&s;ually excites &s;ome voluntary exertion, as anger, or fear, are liable to pro|duce &s;leep; which con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all voluntary power. But if the ideas thus pre&s;ented to us, and intere&s;t our attention, are accompanied with &s;o much plea&s;ureable or painful &s;en&s;ation as to ex|cite our voluntary exertion at the &s;ame time, reverie is the con&s;e|quence. Hence an intere&s;ting play produces reverie, a tedious one produces &s;leep: in the latter we become exhau&s;ted by attention, and are not excited to any voluntary exertion, and therefore &s;leep; in the former we are excited by &s;ome emotion, which prevents by its pain the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, and in as much as it intere&s;ts us, induces reverie, as explained in the next Section.</P>
<P>But when our &s;leep is imperfect, as when we have determined to ri&s;e in half an hour, time appears longer to us than in mo&s;t other &s;itu|ations. Here our &s;olicitude not to over&s;leep the determined time in|duces us in this imperfect &s;leep to compare the quick changes of ima|gined &s;cenery with the parts of time or place, they would have taken up, had they real exi&s;tence; and that more frequently than in our waking hours; and hence the time appears longer to us: and I make no doubt, but the permitted time appears long to a man going to the gallows, as the fear of its quick lap&s;e will make him think frequently about it.</P>

13. As we gain our knowledge of time by comparing the pre&s;ent &s;cenery with the pa&s;t and future, and of place by comparing the &s;itu|ations of objects with each other; &s;o we gain our idea of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s by comparing our&s;elves with the &s;cenery around us; and of identity by comparing our pre&s;ent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s with our pa&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s: as we never think of time or place, but when we make the compa|ri&s;ons above mentioned, &s;o we never think of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, but when we compare our own exi&s;tence with that of other objects; nor of identity, but when we compare our pre&s;ent and our pa&s;t con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s. Hence the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own exi&s;tence, and of our identity, is owing to a voluntary exertion of our minds: and on that account in our complete dreams we neither mea&s;ure time, are &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the &s;udden changes of place, nor attend to our own ex|i&s;tence, or identity; becau&s;e our power of volition is &s;u&s;pended. But all the&s;e circum&s;tances are more or le&s;s ob&s;ervable in our incomplete ones; for then we attend a little to the lap&s;e of time, and the changes of place, and to our own exi&s;tence; and even to our identity of per|&s;on; for a lady &s;eldom dreams, that &s;he is a &s;oldier; nor a man, that he is brought to bed.</P>
<P N="14">14. As long as our &s;en&s;ations only excite their &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, our &s;leep continues &s;ound; but as &s;oon as they excite de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, our &s;leep becomes imperfect; and when that de&s;ire or aver|&s;ion is &s;o &s;trong, as to produce voluntary motions, we begin to awake; the larger mu&s;cles of the body are brought into action to remove that irritation or &s;en&s;ation, which a continued po&s;ture has cau&s;ed; we &s;tretch our limbs, and yawn, and our &s;leep is thus broken by the ac|cumulation of voluntary power.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens, that the act of waking is &s;uddenly pro|duced, and this &s;oon after the commencement of &s;leep; which is oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;en&s;ation &s;o di&s;agreeable, as in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to ex|cite the power of volition; and a temporary action of all the voluntary

motions &s;uddenly &s;ucceeds, and we &s;tart awake. This is &s;ometimes accompanied with loud noi&s;e in the ears, and with &s;ome degree of fear; and when it is in great exce&s;s, &s;o as to produce continued convul&s;ive motions of tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are generally &s;ub&s;ervient to volition, it becomes epilep&s;y: the fits of which in &s;ome patients generally com|mence during &s;leep. This differs from the night-mare de&s;cribed in No. 3. of this Section, becau&s;e in that the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is not &s;o great as to excite the power of volition into action; for as &s;oon as that happens, the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;es.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, which &s;ometimes awakes people &s;oon after the commencement of their &s;leep, is where the voluntary power is al|ready &s;o great in quantity as almo&s;t to prevent them from falling a&s;leep, and then a little accumulation of it &s;oon again awakens them; this happens in ca&s;es of in&s;anity, or where the mind has been lately much agitated by fear or anger. There is another circum&s;tance in which &s;leep is likewi&s;e of &s;hort duration, which ari&s;es from great de|bility, as after great over-fatigue, and in &s;ome fevers, where the &s;trength of the patient is greatly dimini&s;hed, as in the&s;e ca&s;es the pul&s;e intermits or flutters, and the re&s;piration is previou&s;ly affected, it &s;eems to originate from the want of &s;ome voluntary efforts to facilitate re|&s;piration, as when we are awake. And is further treated of in Vol. II. Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 2. on the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Voluntary Power. Art. Som|nus interruptus.</P>
<P N="15">15. We come now to tho&s;e motions which depend on irritation. The motions of the arterial and glandular &s;y&s;tems continue in our &s;leep, proceeding &s;lower indeed, but &s;tronger and more uniformly, than in our waking hours, when they are incommoded by external &s;timuli, or by the movements of volition; the motions of the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to re&s;piration continue to be &s;timulated into action, and the other in|ternal &s;en&s;es of hunger, thir&s;t, and lu&s;t, are not only occa&s;ionally ex|cited in our &s;leep, but their irritative motions are &s;ucceeded by their u&s;ual &s;en&s;ations, and make a part of the farrago of our dreams. The&s;e
<PB N="210" REF="224">
&s;en&s;ations of the want of air, of hunger, thir&s;t, and lu&s;t, in our dreams, contribute to prove, that the nerves of the external &s;en&s;es are al&s;o alive and excitable in our &s;leep; but as the &s;timuli of external objects are either excluded from them by the darkne&s;s and &s;ilence of the night, or their acce&s;s to them is prevented by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of vo|lition, the&s;e nerves of &s;en&s;e fall more readily into their connexions with &s;en&s;ation and with a&s;&s;ociation; becau&s;e much &s;en&s;orial power, which during the day was expended in moving the external organs of &s;en&s;e in con&s;equence of irritation from external &s;timuli, or in con&s;e|quence of volition, becomes now in &s;ome degree accumulated, and renders the internal or immediate organs of &s;en&s;e more ea&s;ily excitable by the other &s;en&s;orial powers. Thus in re&s;pect to the eye, the irrita|tion from external &s;timuli, and the power of volition during our wak|ing hours, elevate the eye-lids, adapt the aperture of the iris to the quantity of light, the focus of the cry&s;talline humour, and the angle of the optic axi&s;es to the di&s;tance of the object, all which perpetual activity during the day expends much &s;en&s;orial power, which is &s;aved during our &s;leep.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that not only tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which are always excited by internal &s;timuli, as the &s;tomach, inte&s;tinal canal, bile-ducts, and the various glands, but the organs of &s;en&s;e al&s;o may be more violently excited into action by the irritation from internal &s;timuli, or by &s;en&s;ation, during our &s;leep than in our waking hours; becau&s;e during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, there is a greater quantity of the &s;pirit of animation to be expended by the other &s;en&s;orial powers. On this account our irritability to internal &s;timuli, and our &s;en&s;ibility to pain or plea&s;ure, is not only greater in &s;leep, but increa&s;es as our &s;leep is prolonged. Whence dige&s;tion and &s;ecretion are performed better in &s;leep, than in our waking hours, and our dreams in the morning have greater variety and vivacity, as our &s;en&s;ibility increa&s;es, than at night when we fir&s;t lie down. And hence epileptic fits, which are always occa&s;ioned by &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, &s;o fre|quently
<PB N="211" REF="225">
attack tho&s;e, who are &s;ubject to them, in their &s;leep; becau&s;e at this time the &s;y&s;tem is more excitable by painful &s;en&s;ation in con|&s;equence of internal &s;timuli; and the power of volition is then &s;ud|denly exerted to relieve this pain, as explained Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.</P>
<P>There is a di&s;ea&s;e, which frequently affects children in the cradle, which is termed ec&s;ta&s;y, and &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in certain exertions to relieve painful &s;en&s;ation, in which the voluntary power is not &s;o far excited as totally to awaken them, and yet is &s;ufficient to remove the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which excites it; in this ca&s;e changing the po&s;ture of the child frequently relieves it.</P>
<P>I have at this time under my care an elegant young man about twenty-two years of age, who &s;eldom &s;leeps more than an hour with|out experiencing a convul&s;ion fit; which cea&s;es in about half a mi|nute without any &s;ub&s;equent &s;tupor. Large do&s;es of opium only prevented the paroxy&s;ms, &s;o long as they prevented him from &s;leeping by the intoxication, which they induced. Other medicines had no effect on him. He was gently awakened every half hour for one night, but without good effect, as he &s;oon &s;lept again, and the fit re|turned at about the &s;ame periods of time, for the accumulated &s;en&s;o|rial power, which occa&s;ioned the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility to pain, was not thus exhau&s;ted. This ca&s;e evinces, that the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem to internal excitation increa&s;es, as our &s;leep is prolonged; till the pain thus occa&s;ioned produces voluntary exertion; which, when it is in its u&s;ual degree, only awakens us; but when it is more violent, it occa&s;ions convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>The cramp in the calf of the leg is another kind of convul&s;ion, which generally commences in &s;leep, occa&s;ioned by the continual in|crea&s;e of irritability from internal &s;timuli, or of &s;en&s;ibility, during that &s;tate of our exi&s;tence. The cramp is a violent exertion to re|lieve pain, generally either of the &s;kin from cold, or of the bowels, as in &s;ome diarrhoeas, or from the mu&s;cles having been previou&s;ly over&s;tretched, as in walking up or down &s;teep hills. But in the&s;e
<PB N="212" REF="226">
convul&s;ions of the mu&s;cles, which form the calf of the leg, the con|traction is &s;o violent as to occa&s;ion another pain in con&s;equence of their own too violent contraction; as &s;oon as the original pain, which cau&s;ed the contraction, is removed. And hence the cramp, or &s;pa&s;m, of the&s;e mu&s;cles is continued without intermi&s;&s;ion by this new pain, unlike the alternate convul&s;ions and remi&s;&s;ions in epileptic fits. The rea&s;on, that the contraction of the&s;e mu&s;cles of the calf of the leg is more violent during their convul&s;ion than that of others, depends on the weakne&s;s of their antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles; for after the&s;e have been contracted in their u&s;ual action, as at every &s;tep in walking, they are again extended, not, as mo&s;t other mu&s;cles are, by their antagoni&s;ts, but by the weight of the whole body on the balls of the toes; and that weight applied to great mechanical advantage on the heel, that is, on the other end of the bone of the foot, which thus acts as a lever.</P>
<P>Another di&s;ea&s;e, the periods of which generally commence during our &s;leep, is the a&s;thma. Whatever may be the remote cau&s;e of pa|roxy&s;ms of a&s;thma, the immediate cau&s;e of the convul&s;ive re&s;piration, whether in the common a&s;thma, or in what is termed the convul&s;ive a&s;thma, which are perhaps only different degrees of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be owing to violent voluntary exertions to relieve pain, as in other convul&s;ions; and the increa&s;e of irritability to internal &s;timuli, or of &s;en&s;ibility, during &s;leep mu&s;t occa&s;ion them to commence at this time.</P>
<P>Debilitated people, who have been unfortunately accu&s;tomed to great ingurgitation of &s;pirituous potation, frequently part with a great quantity of water during the night, but with not more than u&s;ual in the day-time. This is owing to a beginning torpor of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and precedes ana&s;arca, which commences in the day, but is cured in the night by the increa&s;e of the irritability of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem during &s;leep, which thus imbibes from the cellular membrane the fluids, which had been accumulated there during the day; though it is po&s;&s;ible the horizontal po&s;ition of the body may contribute &s;ome|thing to this purpo&s;e, and al&s;o the greater irritability of &s;ome branches
<PB N="213" REF="227">
of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which open their mouths in the cells of the cellular membrane, than that of other branches.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a per&s;on begins to &s;leep, the irritability and &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem begins to increa&s;e, owing to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition and the exclu&s;ion of external &s;timuli. Hence the actions of the ve&s;&s;els in obedience to internal &s;timulation become &s;tronger and more energetic, though le&s;s frequent in re&s;pect to number. And as many of the &s;e|cretions are increa&s;ed, &s;o the heat of the &s;y&s;tem is gradually increa&s;ed, and the extremities of feeble people, which had been cold during the day, become warm. Till towards morning many people become &s;o warm, as to find it nece&s;&s;ary to throw off &s;ome of their bed-clothes, as &s;oon as they awake; and in others &s;weats are &s;o liable to occur to|wards morning during their &s;leep.</P>
<P>Thus tho&s;e, who are not accu&s;tomed to &s;leep in the open air, are very liable to take cold, if they happen to fall a&s;leep on a garden bench, or in a carriage with the window open. For as the &s;y&s;tem is warmer during &s;leep, as above explained, if a current of cold air affects any part of the body, a torpor of that part is more effectually pro|duced, as when a cold bla&s;t of air through a key-hole or ca&s;ement falls upon a per&s;on in a warm room. In tho&s;e ca&s;es the affected part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es le&s;s irritability in re&s;pect to heat from its having previou&s;ly been expo&s;ed to a greater &s;timulus of heat, as in the warm room, or during &s;leep; and hence, when the &s;timulus of heat is dimini&s;hed, a torpor is liable to en&s;ue; that is, we take cold. Hence people who &s;leep in the open air, generally feel chilly both at the approach of &s;leep, and on their awaking; and hence many people are perpetually &s;ubject to catarrhs if they &s;leep in a le&s;s warm head-dre&s;s, than that which they wear in the day.</P>
<P N="16">16. Not only the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and of &s;en&s;ation, but that of a&s;&s;ociation al&s;o appear to act with greater vigour during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition in &s;leep. It will be &s;hewn in another place, that the gout generally fir&s;t attacks the liver, and that afterwards an
<PB N="214" REF="228">
inflammation of the ball of the great toe commences by a&s;&s;ociation, and that of the liver cea&s;es. Now as this change or meta&s;ta&s;is of the activity of the &s;y&s;tem generally commences in &s;leep, it follows, that the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations of motion exi&s;t with greater energy at that time; that is, that the &s;en&s;orial faculty of a&s;&s;ociation, like tho&s;e of irritation and of &s;en&s;ation, becomes in &s;ome mea&s;ure accumulated during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition.</P>
<P>Other a&s;&s;ociate tribes and trains of motions, as well as the irritative and &s;en&s;itive ones, appear to be increa&s;ed in their activity during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition in &s;leep. As tho&s;e which contribute to circu|late the blood, and to perform the various &s;ecretions; as well as the a&s;&s;ociate tribes and trains of ideas, which contribute to furni&s;h the perpetual &s;treams of our dreaming imaginations.</P>
<P>In &s;leep the &s;ecretions have generally been &s;uppo&s;ed to be dimini&s;h|ed, as the expectorated mucus in coughs, the fluids di&s;charged in di|arrhoeas, and in &s;alivation, except indeed the &s;ecretion of &s;weat, which is often vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed. This error &s;eems to have ari&s;en from attention to the excretions rather than to the &s;ecretions. For the &s;e|cretions, except that of &s;weat, are generally received into re&s;ervoirs, as the urine into the bladder, and the mucus of the inte&s;tines and lungs into their re&s;pective cavities; but the&s;e re&s;ervoirs do not ex|clude the&s;e fluids immediately by their &s;timulus, but require at the &s;ame time &s;ome voluntary efforts, and therefore permit them to re|main during &s;leep. And as they thus continue longer in tho&s;e re|ceptacles in our &s;leeping hours, a greater part is ab&s;orbed from them, and the remainder becomes thicker, and &s;ometimes in le&s;s quantity, though at the time it was &s;ecreted the fluid was in greater quantity than in our waking hours. Thus the urine is higher coloured after long &s;leep; which &s;hews, that a greater quantity has been &s;ecreted, and that more of the aqueous and &s;aline part has been reab&s;orbed, and the earthy part left in the bladder; hence thick urine in fevers &s;hews
<PB N="215" REF="229">
only a greater action of the ve&s;&s;els which &s;ecrete it in the kidneys, and of tho&s;e which ab&s;orb it from the bladder.</P>
<P>The &s;ame happens to the mucus expectorated in coughs, which is thus thickened by ab&s;orption of its aqueous and &s;aline parts; and the &s;ame of the feces of the inte&s;tines. From hence it appears, and from what has been &s;aid in No. 15 of this Section concerning the increa&s;e of irritability and of &s;en&s;ibility during &s;leep, that the &s;ecretions are in general rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed during the&s;e hours of our ex|i&s;tence; and it is probable that nutrition is almo&s;t entirely performed in &s;leep; and that young animals grow more at this time than in their waking hours, as young plants have long &s;ince been ob&s;erved to grow more in the night, which is their time of &s;leep.</P>
<P N="17">17. Two other remarkable circum&s;tances of our dreaming ideas are their incon&s;i&s;tency, and the total ab&s;ence of &s;urpri&s;e. Thus we &s;eem to be pre&s;ent at more extraordinary metamorpho&s;es of animals or trees, than are to be met with in the fables of antiquity; and appear to be tran&s;ported from place to place, which &s;eas divide, as quickly as the changes of &s;cenery are performed in a play-hou&s;e; and yet are not &s;en&s;ible of their incon&s;i&s;tency, nor in the lea&s;t degree affected with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider this circum&s;tance more minutely. In our wak|ing trains of ideas, tho&s;e that are incon&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;ual order of nature, &s;o rarely have occurred to us, that their connexion is the &s;lighte&s;t of all others: hence, when a con&s;i&s;tent train of ideas is ex|hau&s;ted, we attend to the external &s;timuli, that u&s;ually &s;urround us, rather than to any incon&s;i&s;tent idea, which might otherwi&s;e pre&s;ent it&s;elf: and if an incon&s;i&s;tent idea &s;hould intrude it&s;elf, we immediately compare it with the preceding one, and voluntarily reject the train it would introduce; this appears further in the Section on Reverie, in which &s;tate of the mind external &s;timuli are not attended to, and yet the &s;treams of ideas are kept con&s;i&s;tent by the efforts of volition. But as our faculty of volition is &s;u&s;pended, and all external &s;timuli are ex|cluded
<PB N="216" REF="230">
in &s;leep, this &s;lighter connexion of ideas takes place; and the train is &s;aid to be incon&s;i&s;tent; that is, di&s;&s;imilar to the u&s;ual order of nature.</P>
<P>But, when any con&s;i&s;tent train of &s;en&s;itive or voluntary ideas is flowing along, if any external &s;timulus affects us &s;o violently, as to in|trude irritative ideas forcibly into the mind, it di&s;unites the former train of ideas, and we are affected with &s;urpri&s;e. The&s;e &s;timuli of unu&s;ual energy or novelty not only di&s;unite our common trains of ideas, but the trains of mu&s;cular motions al&s;o, which have not been long e&s;tabli&s;hed by habit, and di&s;turb tho&s;e that have. Some people become motionle&s;s by great &s;urpri&s;e, the fits of hiccup and of ague have been often removed by it, and it even affects the movements of the heart, and arteries; but in our &s;leep, all external &s;timuli are excluded, and in con&s;equence no &s;urpri&s;e can exi&s;t. See Section XVII. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="18">18. We frequently awake with plea&s;ure from a dream, which has delighted us, without being able to recollect the tran&s;actions of it; unle&s;s perhaps at a di&s;tance of time, &s;ome analogous idea may intro|duce afre&s;h this forgotten train: and in our waking reveries we &s;ome|times in a moment lo&s;e the train of thought, but continue to feel the glow of plea&s;ure, or the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, it occa&s;ioned: whil&s;t at other times we can retrace with ea&s;e the&s;e hi&s;tories of our reveries and dreams.</P>
<P>The above explanation of &s;urpri&s;e throws light upon this &s;ubject. When we are &s;uddenly awaked by any violent &s;timulus, the &s;urpri&s;e totally di&s;unites the trains of our &s;leeping ideas from the&s;e of our wak|ing ones; but if we gradually awake, this does not happen; and we readily unravel the preceding trains of imagination.</P>
<P N="19">19. There are various degrees of &s;urpri&s;e; the more intent we are upon the train of ideas, which we are employed about, the more vio|lent mu&s;t be the &s;timulus that interrupts them, and the greater is the degree of &s;urpri&s;e. I have ob&s;erved dogs, who have &s;lept by the fire,
<PB N="217" REF="231">
and by their ob&s;cure barking and &s;truggling have appeared very intent on their prey, that &s;hewed great &s;urpri&s;e for a few &s;econds after their awaking by looking eagerly around them; which they did not do at other times of waking. And an intelligent friend of mine has re|marked, that his lady, who frequently &s;peaks much and articularly in her &s;leep, could never recollect her dreams in the morning, when this happened to her: but that when &s;he did not &s;peak in her &s;leep, &s;he could always recollect them.</P>
<P>Hence, when our &s;en&s;ations act &s;o &s;trongly in &s;leep as to influence the larger mu&s;cles, as in tho&s;e, who talk or &s;truggle in their dreams; or in tho&s;e, who are affected with complete reverie (as de&s;cribed in the next Section), great &s;urpri&s;e is produced, when they awake; and the&s;e as well as tho&s;e, who are completely drunk or delirious, totally forget afterwards their imaginations at tho&s;e times.</P>
<P N="20">20. As the immediate cau&s;e of &s;leep con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of vo|lition, it follows, that whatever dimini&s;hes the general quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, or derives it from the faculty of volition, will con|&s;titute a remote cau&s;e of &s;leep; &s;uch as fatigue from mu&s;cular or men|tal exertion, which dimini&s;hes the general quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; or an increa&s;e of the &s;en&s;itive motions, as by attending to &s;oft mu&s;ic, which diverts the &s;en&s;orial power from the faculty of volition; or la&s;tly, by increa&s;e of the irritative motions, as by wine, or food, or warmth; which not only by their expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power di|mini&s;h the quantity of volition; but al&s;o by their producing plea&s;ure|able &s;en&s;ations (which occa&s;ion other mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual motions in con&s;equence), doubly decrea&s;e the voluntary power, and thus more forceably produce &s;leep.

<P>Another method of inducing &s;leep is delivered in a very ingenious work lately publi&s;hed by Dr Beddoes. Who, after lamenting that opium frequently occa&s;ions re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, thinks, "that in mo&s;t ca&s;es it would be better to induce &s;leep by the ab&s;traction of &s;timuli, than by exhau&s;ting the excitability;" and adds, "upon this principle we
<PB N="218" REF="232">
could not have a better &s;oporific than an atmo&s;phere with a dimini&s;h|ed proportion of oxygene air, and that common air might be admitted after the patient was a&s;leep." (Ob&s;erv. on Calculus, &amp;c. by Dr. Bed|does. Murray.) If it &s;hould be found to be true, that the excitability of the &s;y&s;tem depends on the quantity of oxygene ab&s;orbed by the lungs in re&s;piration according to the theory of Dr. Beddoes, and of M. Girtanner, this idea of &s;leeping in an atmo&s;phere with le&s;s oxygene in its compo&s;ition might be of great &s;ervice in epileptic ca&s;es, and in cramp, and even in fits of the a&s;thma, where their periods commence from the increa&s;e of irritability during &s;leep.</P>
<P>Sleep is likewi&s;e &s;aid to be induced by mechanic pre&s;&s;ure on the brain in the ca&s;es of &s;pina bifida. Where there has been a de|fect of one of the vertebrae of the back, a tumour is protruded in con|&s;equence; and, whenever this tumour has been compre&s;&s;ed by the hand, &s;leep is &s;aid to be induced, becau&s;e the whole of the brain both within the head and &s;pine becomes compre&s;&s;ed by the retroce&s;&s;ion of the fluid within the tumour. But by what means a compre&s;&s;ion of the brain induces &s;leep has not been explained, but probably by dimini&s;hing the &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power, and then the voluntary motions become &s;u&s;pended previou&s;ly to the irritative ones, as occurs in mo&s;t dying per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Another way of procuring &s;leep mechanically was related to me by Mr. Brindley, the famous canal engineer, who was brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mill-wright; he told me, that he had more than once &s;een the experiment of a man extending him&s;elf acro&s;s the large &s;tone of a corn-mill, and that by gradually letting the &s;tone whirl, the man fell a&s;leep, before the &s;tone had gained its full velocity, and he &s;uppo&s;ed would have died without pain by the continuance or in|crea&s;e of the motion. In this ca&s;e the centrifugal motion of the head and feet mu&s;t accumulate the blood in both tho&s;e extremities of the body, and thus compre&s;s the brain.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we &s;hould mention the application of cold; which, when
<PB N="219" REF="233">
in a le&s;s degree, produces watchfulne&s;s by the pain it occa&s;ions, and the tremulous convul&s;ions of the &s;ubcutaneous mu&s;cles; but when it is applied in great degree, is &s;aid to produce &s;leep. To explain this effect it has been &s;aid, that as the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin and extremities become fir&s;t torpid by the want of the &s;timulus of heat, and as thence le&s;s blood is circulated through them, as appears from their palene&s;s, a greater quantity of blood poured upon the brain produces &s;leep by its compre&s;&s;ion of that organ. But I &s;hould rather imagine, that the &s;en&s;orial power becomes exhau&s;ted by the convul&s;ive actions in con&s;e|quence of the pain of cold, and of the voluntary exerci&s;e previou&s;ly u&s;ed to prevent it, and that the &s;leep is only the beginning to die, as the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of voluntary power in lingering deaths precedes for many hours the extinction of the irritative motions.</P>
<P N="21">21. The following are the characteri&s;tic circum&s;tances attending perfect &s;leep.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The power of volition is totally &s;u&s;pended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The trains of ideas cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation proceed with greater fa|cility and vivacity; but become incon&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;ual order of nature. The mu&s;cular motions cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation continue; as tho&s;e concerned in our evacuations during infancy, and afterwards in dige&s;tion, and in priapi&s;mus.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The irritative mu&s;cular motions continue, as tho&s;e concerned in the circulation, in &s;ecretion, in re&s;piration. But the irritative &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, are not excited; as the immediate organs of &s;en&s;e are not &s;timulated into action by external objects, which are excluded by the external organs of &s;en&s;e; which are not in &s;leep adapted to their reception by the power of volition, as in our waking hours.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The a&s;&s;ociate motions continue; but their fir&s;t link is not ex|cited into action by volition, or by external &s;timuli. In all re&s;pects, except tho&s;e above mentioned, the three la&s;t &s;en&s;orial powers are &s;omewhat increa&s;ed in energy during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, owing to the con&s;equent accumulation of the &s;pirit of animation.</ITEM>

<HEAD>OF REVERIE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>1. Various degrees of reverie. 2. Sleep-walkers. Ca&s;e of a young lady. Great &s;urpri&s;e at awaking. And total forgetfulne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;ed in reverie. 3. No &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition in reverie. 4. Sen&s;itive motions continue, and are con&s;i&s;tent. 5. Irritative motions continue, but are not &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation. 6. Volition nece&s;&s;ary for the perception of feeble impre&s;&s;ions. 7. A&s;&s;ociated motions continue. 8. Nerves of &s;en&s;e are irritable in &s;leep, but not in reverie. 9. Somnambuli are not a&s;leep. Contagion received but once. 10. Definition of reverie.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. WHEN we are employed with great &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure, or with great efforts of volition, in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome intere&s;ting train of ideas, we cea&s;e to be con&s;cious of our exi&s;tence, are inattentive to time and place, and do not di&s;tingui&s;h this train of &s;en&s;itive and vo|luntary ideas from the irritative ones excited by the pre&s;ence of exter|nal objects, though our organs of &s;en&s;e are &s;urrounded with their ac|cu&s;tomed &s;timuli, till at length this intere&s;ting train of ideas becomes exhau&s;ted, or the appul&s;es of external objects are applied with unu&s;ual violence, and we return with &s;urpri&s;e, or with regret, into the com|mon track of life. This is termed reverie or &s;tudium.</P>
<P>In &s;ome con&s;titutions the&s;e reveries continue a con&s;iderable time, and are not to be removed without greater difficulty, but are experi|enced in a le&s;s degree by us all; when we attend earne&s;tly to the ideas excited by volition or &s;en&s;ation, with their a&s;&s;ociated connexions, but are at the &s;ame time con&s;cious at intervals of the &s;timuli of &s;urround|ing bodies. Thus in being pre&s;ent at a play, or in reading a romance,
<PB N="221" REF="235">
&s;ome per&s;ons are &s;o totally ab&s;orbed as to forget their u&s;ual time of &s;leep, and to neglect their meals; while others are &s;aid to have been &s;o involved in voluntary &s;tudy as not to have heard the di&s;charge of artillery; and there is a &s;tory of an Italian politician, who could think &s;o inten&s;ely on other &s;ubjects, as to be in&s;en&s;ible to the torture of the rack.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that the&s;e catenations of ideas and mu&s;cular motions, which form the trains of reverie, are compo&s;ed both of vo|luntary and &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations of them; and that the&s;e ideas differ from tho&s;e of delirium or of &s;leep, as they are kept con&s;i&s;tent by the power of volition; and they differ al&s;o from the trains of ideas belong|ing to in&s;anity, as they are as frequently excited by &s;en&s;ation as by volition. But la&s;tly, that the whole &s;en&s;orial power is &s;o employed on the&s;e trains of complete reverie, that like the violent efforts of vo|lition, as in convul&s;ions or in&s;anity; or like the great activity of the irritative motions in drunkenne&s;s; or of the &s;en&s;itive motions in de|lirium; they preclude all &s;en&s;ation con&s;equent to external &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are &s;aid to walk in their &s;leep, are affected with reverie to &s;o great a degree, that it becomes a formidable di&s;ea&s;e; the e&s;&s;ence of which con&s;i&s;ts in the inaptitude of the mind to attend to external &s;timuli. Many hi&s;tories of this di&s;ea&s;e have been publi&s;hed by medical writers; of which there is a very curious one in the Lau|&s;anne Tran&s;actions. I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin an account of &s;uch a ca&s;e, with its cure, for the better illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A very ingenious and elegant young lady, with light eyes and hair, about the age of &s;eventeen, in other re&s;pects well, was &s;uddenly &s;eized &s;oon after her u&s;ual men&s;truation with this very wonderful ma|lady. The di&s;ea&s;e began with vehement convul&s;ions of almo&s;t every mu&s;cle of her body, with great but vain efforts to vomit, and the mo&s;t violent hiccoughs, that can be conceived: the&s;e were &s;ucceeded in about an hour with a fixed &s;pa&s;m; in which one hand was applied to her head, and the other to &s;upport it: in about half an hour the&s;e
<PB N="222" REF="236">
cea&s;ed, and the reverie began &s;uddenly, and was at fir&s;t manife&s;t by the look of her eyes and countenance, which &s;eemed to expre&s;s at|tention. Then &s;he conver&s;ed aloud with imaginary per&s;ons with her eyes open, and could not for about an hour be brought to attend to the &s;timulus of external objects by any kind of violence, which it was proper to u&s;e: the&s;e &s;ymptoms returned in this order every day for five or &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>The&s;e conver&s;ations were quite con&s;i&s;tent, and we could under|&s;tand, what &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her imaginary companions to an&s;wer, by the continuation of her part of the di&s;cour&s;e. Sometimes &s;he was angry, at other times &s;hewed much wit and vivacity, but was mo&s;t frequently inclined to melancholy. In the&s;e reveries &s;he &s;ometimes &s;ung over &s;ome mu&s;ic with accuracy, and repeated whole pages from the Engli&s;h poets. In repeating &s;ome lines from Mr. Pope's works &s;he had forgot one word, and began again, endeavouring to recollect it; when &s;he came to the forgotten word, it was &s;houted aloud in her ear, and this repeatedly, to no purpo&s;e; but by many trials &s;he at length regained it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e paroxy&s;ms were terminated with the appearance of inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e, and great fear, from which &s;he was &s;ome minutes in recovering her&s;elf, calling on her &s;i&s;ter with great agitation, and very frequently underwent a repetition of convul&s;ions, apparently from the pain of fear. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7.</P>
<P>After having thus returned for about an hour every day for two or three weeks, the reveries &s;eemed to become le&s;s complete, and &s;ome of their circum&s;tances varied; &s;o that &s;he could walk about the room in them without running again&s;t any of the furniture; though the&s;e motions were at fir&s;t very un&s;teady and tottering. And afterwards &s;he once drank a di&s;h of tea, when the whole apparatus of the tea|table was &s;et before her; and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, that a medi|cine was put into it, and once &s;eemed to &s;mell of a tubero&s;e, which was in flower in her chamber, and deliberated aloud about breaking it
<PB N="223" REF="237">
from the &s;tem, &s;aying, "it would make her &s;i&s;ter &s;o charmingly angry." At another time in her melancholy moments &s;he heard the &s;ound of a pa&s;&s;ing bell, "I wi&s;h I was dead," &s;he cried, li&s;tening to the bell, and then taking off one of her &s;hoes, as &s;he &s;at upon the bed, "I love the colour black," &s;ays &s;he, "a little wider, and a little longer, even this might make me a coffin!"&mdash;Yet it is evident, &s;he was not &s;en&s;ible at this time, any more than formerly, of &s;eeing or hearing any per&s;on about her; indeed when great light was thrown upon her by opening the &s;hutters of the window, her trains of ideas &s;eemed le&s;s melancholy; and when I have forcibly held her hands, or covered her eyes, &s;he appeared to grow impatient, and would &s;ay, &s;he could not tell what to do, for &s;he could neither &s;ee nor move. In all the&s;e circum&s;tances her pul&s;e continued unaffected as in health. And when the paroxy&s;m was over, &s;he could never recollect a &s;ingle idea of what had pa&s;&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>This a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;ea&s;e, after the u&s;e of many other medicines and applications in vain, was cured by very large do&s;es of opium given about an hour before the expected returns of the paroxy&s;ms; and after a few relap&s;es, at the intervals of three or four months, entirely di&s;|appeared. But &s;he continued at times to have other &s;ymptoms of epilep&s;y.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hall only here con&s;ider, what happened during the time of her reveries, as that is our pre&s;ent &s;ubject; the fits of convul&s;ion be|long to another part of this treati&s;e. Sect. XXXIV. 44.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to have been no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition during the fits of reverie, becau&s;e &s;he endeavoured to regain the lo&s;t idea in repeating the lines of poetry, and deliberated about breaking the tubero&s;e, and &s;u&s;pected the tea to have been medicated.</P>
<P N="4">4. The ideas and mu&s;cular movements depending on &s;en&s;ation were exerted with their u&s;ual vivacity, and were kept from being incon|&s;i&s;tent by the power of volition, as appeared from her whole conver|&s;ation, and was explained in Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 16.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="224" REF="238">
5. The ideas and motions dependant on irritation during the fir&s;t weeks of her di&s;ea&s;e, whil&s;t the reverie was complete, were never &s;ucceeded by the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain; as &s;he neither &s;aw, heard, nor felt any of the &s;urrounding objects. Nor was it certain that any irritative motions &s;ucceeded the &s;timulus of external objects, till the reverie became le&s;s complete, and then &s;he could walk about the room without running again&s;t the furniture of it. Afterwards, when the reverie became &s;till le&s;s complete from the u&s;e of opium, &s;ome few irritations were at times &s;ucceeded by her attention to them. As when &s;he &s;melt at a tubero&s;e, and drank a di&s;h of tea, but this only when &s;he &s;eemed voluntarily to attend to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. In common life when we li&s;ten to di&s;tant &s;ounds, or wi&s;h to di&s;tingui&s;h objects in the night, we are obliged &s;trongly to exert our volition to di&s;po&s;e the organs of &s;en&s;e to perceive them, and to &s;up|pre&s;s the other trains of ideas, which might interrupt the&s;e feeble &s;en|&s;ations. Hence in the pre&s;ent hi&s;tory the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timuli were not perceived, except when the faculty of volition was exerted on the organ of &s;en&s;e; and then even common &s;timuli were &s;ometimes per|ceived: for her mind was &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly employed in pur&s;uing its own trains of voluntary or &s;en&s;itive ideas, that no common &s;timuli could &s;o far excite her attention as to di&s;unite them; that is, the quantity of volition or of &s;en&s;ation already exi&s;ting was greater than any, which could be produced in con&s;equence of common degrees of &s;timulation. But the few &s;timuli of the tubero&s;e, and of the tea, which &s;he did perceive, were &s;uch, as accidentally coincided with the trains of thought, which were pa&s;&s;ing in her mind; and hence did not di&s;|unite tho&s;e trains, and create &s;urpri&s;e. And their being perceived at all was owing to the power of volition preceding or coinciding with that of irritation.</P>
<P>This explication is countenanced by a fact mentioned concerning a &s;omnambuli&s;t in the Lau&s;anne Tran&s;actions, who &s;ometimes opened his eyes for a &s;hort time to examine, where he was, or where his ink|pot
<PB N="225" REF="239">
&s;tood, and then &s;hut them again, dipping his pen into the pot every now and then, and writing on, but never opening his eyes af|terwards, although he wrote on from line to line regularly, and cor|rected &s;ome errors of the pen, or in &s;pelling: &s;o much ea&s;ier was it to him to refer to his ideas of the po&s;itions of things, than to his per|ceptions of them.</P>
<P N="7">7. The a&s;&s;ociated motions per&s;i&s;ted in their u&s;ual channel, as ap|peared by the combinations of her ideas, and the u&s;e of her mu&s;cles, and the equality of her pul&s;e; for the natural motions of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, though originally excited like other motions by &s;timulus, &s;eem in part to continue by their a&s;&s;ociation with each other. As the heart of a viper pul&s;ates long after it is cut out of the body, and re|moved from the &s;timulus of the blood.</P>
<P N="8">8. In the &s;ection on &s;leep, it was ob&s;erved that the nerves of &s;en&s;e are equally alive and &s;u&s;ceptible to irritation in that &s;tate, as when we are awake; but that they are &s;ecluded from &s;timulating objects, or rendered unfit to receive them: but in complete reverie the rever&s;e happens, the immediate organs of &s;en&s;e are expo&s;ed to their u&s;ual &s;ti|muli; but are either not excited into action at all, or not into &s;o great action, as to produce attention or &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>The total forgetfulne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es in reveries; and the &s;urpri&s;e on recovering from them, are explained in Section XVIII. 19. and in Section XVII. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="9">9. It appears from hence, that reverie is a di&s;ea&s;e of the epileptic or cataleptic kind, &s;ince the paroxy&s;ms of this young lady always be|gan and frequently terminated with convul&s;ions; and though in its greate&s;t degree it has been called &s;omnambulation, or &s;leep-walking, it is totally different from &s;leep; becau&s;e the e&s;&s;ential character of &s;leep con&s;i&s;ts in the total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, which in reverie is not affected; and the e&s;&s;ential character of reverie con&s;i&s;ts not in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e irritative motions of our &s;en&s;es, which are occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of external objects, but in their never being produc|tive
<PB N="226" REF="240">
of &s;en&s;ation. So that during a fit of reverie that &s;trange event happens to the whole &s;y&s;tem of nerves, which occurs only to &s;ome particular branches of them in tho&s;e, who are a &s;econd time expo&s;ed to the action of contagious matter. If the matter of the &s;mall-pox be in&s;erted into the arm of one, who has previou&s;ly had that di&s;ea&s;e, it will &s;timulate the wound, but the general &s;en&s;ation or inflammation of the &s;y&s;tem does not follow, which con&s;titutes the di&s;ea&s;e. See Sect. XII. 7. 6. XXXIII. 2. 8.</P>
<P N="10">10. The following is the definition or character of complete reverie. 1. The irritative motions occa&s;ioned by internal &s;timuli continue, tho&s;e from the &s;timuli of external objects are either not produced at all, or are never &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation or attention, unle&s;s they are at the &s;ame time excited by volition. 2. The &s;en&s;itive motions con|tinue, and are kept con&s;i&s;tent by the power of volition. 3. The vo|luntary motions continue undi&s;turbed. 4. The a&s;&s;ociate motions con|tinue undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Two other ca&s;es of reverie are related in Section XXXIV. 3. which further evince, that reverie is an effort of the mind to relieve &s;ome painful &s;en&s;ation, and is hence allied to convul&s;ion, and to in&s;anity.</P>

Attention of the mind prevents &s;light &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. After a voyage ideas of vibratory motions are &s;till perceived on &s;hore. 6. Ideas continue &s;ome time after they are excited. Circum&s;tances of turning on one foot, &s;tanding on a tower, and walking in the dark explained. 7. Irritative ideas of apparent mo|tions. Irritative ideas of &s;ounds. Batt&egrave;ment of the &s;ound of bells and organ-pipes. Vertiginous noi&s;e in the head. Irritative motions of the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and glands. 8. Symptoms that accompany vertigo. Why vomiting comes on in &s;trokes of the pal&s;y. By the motion of a &s;hip. By injuries on the head. Why motion makes &s;ick people vomit. 9. Why drunken people are vertiginous. Why a &s;tone in the ureter, or bile-duct, produces vomiting. 10. Why after a voyage ideas of vibratory motions are perceived on &s;hore. 11. Kinds of vertigo and their cure. 12. Definition of vertigo.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. IN learning to walk we judge of the di&s;tances of the objects, which we approach, by the eye; and by ob&s;erving their perpendicu|larity determine our own. This circum&s;tance not having been at|tended to by the writers on vi&s;ion, the di&s;ea&s;e called vertigo or dizzi|ne&s;s has been little under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="242">
When any per&s;on lo&s;es the power of mu&s;cular action, whether he is erect or in a &s;itting po&s;ture, he &s;inks down upon the ground; as is &s;een in fainting fits, and other in&s;tances of great debility. Hence it follows, that &s;ome exertion of mu&s;cular power is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve our perpendicular attitude. This is performed by proportionally ex|erting the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles of the trunk, neck, and limbs; and if at any time in our locomotions we find our&s;elves inclining to one &s;ide, we either re&s;tore our equilibrium by the efforts of the mu&s;cles on the other &s;ide, or by moving one of our feet extend the ba&s;e, which we re&s;t upon, to the new center of gravity.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t ea&s;y and habitual manner of determining our want of perpendicularity, is by attending to the apparent motion of the objects within the &s;phere of di&s;tinct vi&s;ion; for this apparent motion of ob|jects, when we incline from our perpendicularity, or begin to fall, is as much greater than the real motion of the eye, as the diameter of the &s;phere of di&s;tinct vi&s;ion is to our perpendicular height.</P>
<P>Hence no one, who is hood-winked, can walk in a &s;traight line for a hundred &s;teps together; for he inclines &s;o greatly, before he is warned of his want of perpendicularity by the &s;en&s;e of touch, not having the apparent motions of ambient objects to mea&s;ure this incli|nation by, that he is nece&s;&s;itated to move one of his feet outwards, to the right or to the left, to &s;upport the new centre of gravity, and thus errs from the line he endeavours to proceed in.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on many people become dizzy, when they look from the &s;ummit of a tower, which is rai&s;ed much above all other ob|jects, as the&s;e objects are out of the &s;phere of di&s;tinct vi&s;ion, and they are obliged to balance their bodies by the le&s;s accurate feelings of their mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>There is another curious phenomenon belonging to this place, if the circumjacent vi&s;ible objects are &s;o &s;mall, that we do not di&s;tingui&s;h their minute parts; or &s;o &s;imilar, that we do not know them from each other; we cannot determine our perpendicularity by them. Thus

in a room hung with a paper, which is coloured over with &s;imilar &s;mall black lozenges or rhomboids, many people become dizzy; for when they begin to fall, the next and the next lozenge &s;ucceeds upon the eye; which they mi&s;take for the fir&s;t, and are not aware, that they have any apparent motion. But if you fix a &s;heet of paper, or draw any other figure, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e lozenges, the charm cea&s;es, and no dizzine&s;s is perceptible.&mdash;The &s;ame occurs, when we ride over a plain covered with &s;now without trees or other eminent objects.</P>
<P N="2">2. But after having compared vi&s;ible objects at re&s;t with the &s;en&s;e of touch, and learnt to di&s;tingui&s;h their &s;hapes and &s;hades, and to mea&s;ure our want of perpendicularity by their apparent motions, we come to con&s;ider them in real motion. Here a new difficulty occurs, and we require &s;ome experience to learn the peculiar mode of motion of any moving objects, before we can make u&s;e of them for the pur|po&s;es of determining our perpendicularity. Thus &s;ome people become dizzy at the &s;ight of a whirling wheel, or by gazing on the fluctua|tions of a river, if no &s;teady objects are at the &s;ame time within the &s;phere of their di&s;tinct vi&s;ion; and when a child fir&s;t can &s;tand erect upon his legs, if you gain his attention to a white handkerchief &s;teadi|ly extended like a &s;ail, and afterwards make it undulate, he in&s;tantly lo&s;es his perpendicularity, and tumbles on the ground.</P>
<P N="3">3. A &s;econd difficulty we have to encounter is to di&s;tingui&s;h our own real movements from the apparent motions of objects. Our daily practice of walking and riding on hor&s;eback &s;oon in&s;tructs us with accuracy to di&s;cern the&s;e modes of motion, and to a&s;cribe the apparent motions of the ambient objects to our&s;elves; but tho&s;e, which we have not acquired by repeated habit, continue to confound us. So as we ride on hor&s;eback the trees and cottages, which occur to us, appear at re&s;t; we can mea&s;ure their di&s;tances with our eye, and regulate our attitude by them; yet if we carele&s;sly attend to di&s;|tant hills or woods through a thin hedge, which is near us, we ob|&s;erve
<PB N="230" REF="244">
the jumping and progre&s;&s;ive motions of them; as this is in|crea&s;ed by the paralax of the&s;e objects; which we have not habituated our&s;elves to attend to. When fir&s;t an European mounts an elephant &s;ixteen feet high, and who&s;e mode of motion he is not accu&s;tomed to, the objects &s;eem to undulate, as he pa&s;&s;es, and he frequently becomes &s;ick and vertiginous, as I am well informed. Any other unu&s;ual move|ment of our bodies has the &s;ame effect, as riding backwards in a coach, &s;winging on a rope, turning round &s;wiftly on one leg, &s;cating on the ice, and a thou&s;and others. So after a patient has been long confined to his bed, when he fir&s;t attempts to walk, he finds him&s;elf verti|ginous, and is obliged by practice to learn again the particular modes of the apparent motions of objects, as he walks by them.</P>
<P N="4">4. A third difficulty, which occurs to us in learning to balance our&s;elves by the eye, is, when both our&s;elves and the circumjacent objects are in real motion. Here it is nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould be habituated to both the&s;e modes of motion in order to pre&s;erve our per|pendicularity. Thus on hor&s;eback we accurately ob&s;erve another per&s;on, whom we meet, trotting towards us, without confounding his jumping and progre&s;&s;ive motion with our own, becau&s;e we have been accu&s;tomed to them both; that is, to undergo the one, and to &s;ee the other at the &s;ame time. But in riding over a broad and fluc|tuating &s;tream, though we are well experienced in the motions of our hor&s;e, we are liable to become dizzy from our inexperience in that of the water. And when fir&s;t we go on &s;hip-board, where the move|ments of our&s;elves, and the movements of the large waves are both new to us, the vertigo is almo&s;t unavoidable with the terrible &s;ickne&s;s, which attends it. And this I have been a&s;&s;ured has happened to &s;e|veral from being removed from a large &s;hip into a &s;mall one; and again from a &s;mall one into a man of war.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the foregoing examples it is evident, that, when we are &s;urrounded with unu&s;ual motions, we lo&s;e our perpendicularity: but there are &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances attending this effect of moving
<PB N="231" REF="245">
objects, which we come now to mention, and &s;hall hope from the re|cital of them to gain &s;ome in&s;ight into the manner of their produc|tion.</P>
<P>When a child moves round quick upon one foot, the circumjacent objects become quite indi&s;tinct, as their di&s;tance increa&s;es their appa|rent motions; and this great velocity confounds both their forms, and their colours, as is &s;een in whirling round a many coloured wheel; he then lo&s;es his u&s;ual method of balancing him&s;elf by vi&s;ion, and be|gins to &s;tagger, and attempts to recover him&s;elf by his mu&s;cular feel|ings. This &s;taggering adds to the in&s;tability of the vi&s;ible objects by giving a vibratory motion be&s;ides their rotatory one. The child then drops upon the ground, and the neighbouring objects &s;eem to con|tinue for &s;ome &s;econds of time to circulate around him, and the earth under him appears to librate like a balance. In &s;ome &s;econds of time the&s;e &s;en&s;ations of a continuation of the motion of objects vani&s;h; but if he continues turning round &s;omewhat longer, before he falls, &s;ick|ne&s;s and vomiting are very liable to &s;ucceed. But none of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances affect tho&s;e who have habituated them&s;elves to this kind of motion, as the dervi&s;es in Turkey, among&s;t whom the&s;e &s;wift gyrations are a ceremony of religion.</P>
<P>In an open boat pa&s;&s;ing from Leith to Kinghorn in Scotland, a &s;ud|den change of the wind &s;hook the undi&s;tended &s;ail, and &s;topt our boat; from this unu&s;ual movement the pa&s;&s;engers all vomited except my|&s;elf. I ob&s;erved, that the undulation of the &s;hip, and the in&s;tability of all vi&s;ible objects, inclined me &s;trongly to be &s;ick; and this conti|nued or increa&s;ed, when I clo&s;ed my eyes, but as often as I bent my attention with energy on the management and mechani&s;m of the ropes and &s;ails, the &s;ickne&s;s cea&s;ed; and recurred again, as often as I re|laxed this attention; and I am a&s;&s;ured by a gentleman of ob&s;ervation and veracity, that he has more than once ob&s;erved, when the ve&s;&s;el has been in immediate danger, that the &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;engers
<PB N="232" REF="246">
has in&s;tantaneou&s;ly cea&s;ed, and recurred again, when the danger was over.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who have been upon the water in a boat or &s;hip &s;o long, that they have acquired the nece&s;&s;ary habits of motion upon that un|&s;table element, at their return on land frequently think in their reve|ries, or between &s;leeping and waking, that they ob&s;erve the room, they &s;it in, or &s;ome of its furniture, to librate like the motion of the ve&s;&s;el. This I have experienced my&s;elf, and have been told, that after long voyages, it is &s;ome time before the&s;e ideas entirely vani&s;h. The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in a le&s;s degree after having travelled &s;ome days in a &s;tage coach, and particularly when we lie down in bed, and compo&s;e our&s;elves to &s;leep; in this ca&s;e it is ob&s;ervable, that the rat|tling noi&s;e of the coach, as well as the undulatory motion, haunts us. The drunken vertigo, and the vulgar cu&s;tom of rocking children, will be con&s;idered in the next Section.</P>
<P N="6">6. The motions, which are produced by the power of volition, may be immediately &s;topped by the exertion of the &s;ame power on the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles; otherwi&s;e the&s;e with all the other cla&s;&s;es of mo|tion continue to go on, &s;ome time after they are excited, as the pal|pitation of the heart continues after the object of fear, which occa&s;ion|ed it, is removed. But this circum&s;tance is in no cla&s;s of motions more remarkable than in tho&s;e dependent on irritation; thus if any one looks at the &s;un, and then covers his eyes with his hand, he will for many &s;econds of time, perceive the image of the &s;un marked on his retina: a &s;imilar image of all other vi&s;ible objects would remain &s;ome time formed on the retina, but is extingui&s;hed by the perpetual change of the motions of this nerve in our attention to other objects. To this mu&s;t be added, that the longer time any movements have continued to be excited without fatigue to the organ, the longer will they continue &s;pontaneou&s;ly, after the excitement is withdrawn: as the ta&s;te of tobacco in the mouth after a per&s;on has been &s;moaking it.
<PB N="233" REF="247">
This ta&s;te remains &s;o &s;trong, that if a per&s;on continues to draw air through a tobacco pipe in the dark, after having been &s;moking &s;ome time, he cannot di&s;tingui&s;h whether his pipe be lighted or not.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two con&s;iderations it appears, that the dizzine&s;s felt in the head, after &s;eeing objects in unu&s;ual motion, is no other than a continuation of the motions of the optic nerve excited by tho&s;e objects, and which engage our attention. Thus on turning round on one foot, the vertigo continues for &s;ome &s;econds of time after the per&s;on is fallen on the ground; and the longer he has continued to revolve, the longer will continue the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions of the parts of the optic nerve.</P>
<P>Any one, who &s;tands alone on the top of a high tower, if he has not been accu&s;tomed to balance him&s;elf by objects placed at &s;uch di&s;|tances and with &s;uch inclinations, begins to &s;tagger, and endeavours to recover him&s;elf by his mu&s;cular feelings. During this time the apparent motion of objects at a di&s;tance below him is very great, and the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e apparent motions continue a little time after he has experienced them; and he is per&s;uaded to incline the contrary way to counteract their effects; and either immediately falls, or ap|plying his hands to the building, u&s;es his mu&s;cular feelings to pre&s;erve his perpendicular attitude, contrary to the erroneous per&s;ua&s;ions of his eyes. Whil&s;t the per&s;on, who walks in the dark, &s;taggers, but with|out dizzine&s;s; for he neither has the &s;en&s;ation of moving objects to take off his attention from his mu&s;cular feelings, nor has he the &s;pec|tra of tho&s;e motions continued on his retina to add to his confu&s;ion. It happens indeed &s;ometimes to one &s;tanding on a tower, that the idea of his not having room to extend his ba&s;e by moving one of his feet outwards, when he begins to incline, &s;uperadds fears to his other inconveniences; which like &s;urpri&s;e, joy, or any great degree of &s;en|&s;ation, enervates him in a moment, by employing the whole &s;en&s;o|rial power, and by thus breaking all the a&s;&s;ociated trains and tribes of motion.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="234" REF="248">
7. The irritative ideas of objects, whil&s;t we are awake, are per|petually pre&s;ent to our &s;en&s;e of &s;ight; as we view the furniture of our rooms, or the ground, we tread upon, throughout the whole day with|out attending to it. And as our bodies are never at perfect re&s;t during our waking hours, the&s;e irritative ideas of objects are attended per|petually with irritative ideas of their apparent motions. The ideas of apparent motions are always irritative ideas, becau&s;e we never attend to them, whether we attend to the objects them&s;elves, or to their real motions, or to neither. Hence the ideas of the apparent motions of objects are a complete circle of irritative ideas, which continue throughout the day.</P>
<P>Al&s;o during all our waking hours, there is a perpetual confu&s;ed &s;ound of various bodies, as of the wind in our rooms, the fire, di&s;|tant conver&s;ations, mechanic bu&s;ine&s;s; this continued buzz, as we are &s;eldom quite motionle&s;s, changes its loudne&s;s perpetually, like the &s;ound of a bell; which ri&s;es and falls as long as it continues, and &s;eems to pul&s;ate on the ear. This any one may experience by turning him&s;elf round near a waterfall; or by &s;triking a gla&s;s bell, and then moving the direction of its mouth towards the ears, or from them, as long as its vibrations continue. Hence this undulation of indi&s;tinct &s;ound makes another concomitant circle of irritative ideas, which con|tinues throughout the day.</P>
<P>We hear this undulating &s;ound, when we are perfectly at re&s;t our|&s;elves, from other &s;onorous bodies be&s;ides bells; as from two organ|pipes, which are nearly but not quite in uni&s;on, when they are &s;ounded together. When a bell is &s;truck, the circular form is changed into an eliptic one; the longe&s;t axis of which, as the vibrations con|tinue, moves round the periphery of the bell; and when either axis of this elip&s;e is pointed towards our ears, the &s;ound is louder; and le&s;s when the intermediate parts of the elip&s;e are oppo&s;ite to us. The vibrations of the two organ-pipes may be compared to Nonius's rule; the &s;ound is louder, when they coincide, and le&s;s at the intermediate
<PB N="235" REF="249">
times. But, as the &s;ound of bells is the mo&s;t familiar of tho&s;e &s;ounds, which have a con&s;iderable battement, the vertiginous patients, who attend to the irritative circles of &s;ounds above de&s;cribed, generally com|pare it to the noi&s;e of bells.</P>
<P>The peri&s;taltic motions of our &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and the &s;ecretions of the various glands, are other circles of irritative motions, &s;ome of them more or le&s;s complete, according to our ab&s;tinence or &s;atiety.</P>
<P>So that the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects, the irritative battements of &s;ounds, and the movements of our bowels and glands compo&s;e a great circle of irritative tribes of motion: and when one con&s;iderable part of this circle of motions becomes interrupted, the whole proceeds in confu&s;ion, as de&s;cribed in Section XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation of Motions.</P>
<P N="8">8. Hence a violent vertigo, from whatever cau&s;e it happens, is ge|nerally attended with undulating noi&s;e in the head, perver&s;ions of the motions of the &s;tomach and duodenum, unu&s;ual excretion of bile and ga&s;tic juice, with much pale urine, &s;ometimes with yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, and a di&s;ordered &s;ecretion of almo&s;t every gland of the body, till at length the arterial &s;y&s;tem is affected, and fever &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>Thus bilious vomitings accompany the vertigo occa&s;ioned by the motion of a &s;hip; and when the brain is rendered vertiginous by a paralytic affection of any part of the body, a vomiting generally en|&s;ues, and a great di&s;charge of bile: and hence great injuries of the head from external violence are &s;ucceeded with bilious vomitings, and &s;ometimes with ab&s;ce&s;&s;es of the liver. And hence, when a pa|tient is inclined to vomit from other cau&s;es, as in &s;ome fevers, any motions of the attendants in his room, or of him&s;elf when he is rai&s;ed or turned in his bed, pre&s;ently induces the vomiting by &s;uperadding a degree of vertigo.</P>
<P N="9">9. And conver&s;ely it is very u&s;ual with tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;tomachs are affected from internal cau&s;es, to be afflicted with vertigo, and noi&s;e
<PB N="236" REF="250">
in the head; &s;uch is the vertigo of drunken people, which continues, when their eyes are clo&s;ed, and them&s;elves in a recumbent po&s;ture, as well as when they are in an erect po&s;ture, and have their eyes open. And thus the irritation of a &s;tone in the bile-duct, or in the ureter, or an inflammation of any of the inte&s;tines, are accompanied with vomitings and vertigo.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the irritative motions of the &s;tomach, which are in general not attended to, become &s;o changed by &s;ome unnatural &s;ti|mulus, as to become unea&s;y, and excite our &s;en&s;ation or attention. And thus the other irritative trains of motions, which are a&s;&s;ociated with it, become di&s;ordered by their &s;ympathy. The &s;ame happens, when a piece of gravel &s;ticks in the ureter, or when &s;ome part of the inte&s;tinal canal becomes inflamed. In the&s;e ca&s;es the irritative mu&s;|cular motions are fir&s;t di&s;turbed by unu&s;ual &s;timulus, and a di&s;ordered action of the &s;en&s;ual motions, or dizzine&s;s en&s;ues. While in &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s the irritative &s;en&s;ual motions, as vertigo, precedes; and the di&s;ordered irritative mu&s;cular motions, as tho&s;e of the &s;tomach in vo|miting, follow.</P>
<P N="10">10. When the&s;e irritative motions are di&s;turbed, if the degree be not very great, the exertion of voluntary attention to any other object, or any &s;udden &s;en&s;ation, will disjoin the&s;e new habits of motion. Thus &s;ome drunken people have become &s;ober immediately, when any accident has &s;trongly excited their attention; and &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s has vani&s;hed, when the &s;hip has been in danger. Hence when our at|tention to other objects is mo&s;t relaxed, as ju&s;t before we fall a&s;leep, or between our reveries when awake, the&s;e irritative ideas of motion and &s;ound are mo&s;t liable to be perceived; as tho&s;e, who have been at &s;ea, or have travelled long in a coach, &s;eem to perceive the vibrations of the &s;hip, or the rattling of the wheels, at the&s;e intervals; which cea&s;e again, as &s;oon as they exert their attention. That is, at tho&s;e intervals they attend to the apparent motions, and to the battement of &s;ounds of the bodies around them, and for a moment mi&s;take them
<PB N="237" REF="251">
for tho&s;e real motions of the &s;hip, and noi&s;e of wheels, which they had lately been accu&s;tomed to: or at the&s;e intervals of reverie, or on the approach of &s;leep, the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed motions or &s;ounds may be produced entirely by imagination.</P>
<P>We may conclude from this account of vertigo, that &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s is not an effort of nature to relieve her&s;elf, but a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;ociations or catenations of animal motions. And may thence infer, that the vomiting, which attends the gravel in the ureter, in|flammations of the bowels, and the commencement of &s;ome fevers, has a &s;imilar origin, and is not always an effort of the vis medicatrix naturae. But where the action of the organ is the immediate con&s;e|quence of the &s;timulating cau&s;e, it is frequently exerted to di&s;lodge that &s;timulus, as in vomiting up an emetic drug; at other times, the action of an organ is a general effort to relieve pain, as in convul|&s;ions of the locomotive mu&s;cles; other actions drink up and carry on the fluids, as in ab&s;orption and &s;ecretion; all which may be termed ef|forts of nature to relieve, or to pre&s;erve her&s;elf.</P>
<P N="11">11. The cure of vertigo will frequently depend on our previou&s;ly inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e of it, which from what has been delivered above may originate from the di&s;order of any part of the great tribes of irritative motions, and of the a&s;&s;ociate motions catenated with them.</P>
<P>Many people, when they arrive at fifty or &s;ixty years of age, are af|fected with &s;light vertigo; which is generally but wrongly a&s;cribed to indige&s;tion, but in reality ari&s;es from a beginning defect of their &s;ight; as about this time they al&s;o find it nece&s;&s;ary to begin to u&s;e &s;pectacles, when they read &s;mall prints, e&s;pecially in winter, or by candle light, but are yet able to read without them during the &s;ummer days, when the light is &s;tronger. The&s;e people do not &s;ee objects &s;o di&s;tinctly as formerly, and by exerting their eyes more than u&s;ual, they perceive the apparent motions of objects, and confound them with the real motions of them; and therefore cannot accurately balance them&s;elves &s;o as ea&s;ily to pre&s;erve their perpendicularity by them.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="252">
That is, the apparent motions of objects, which are at re&s;t, as we move by them, &s;hould only excite irritative ideas: but as the&s;e are now become le&s;s di&s;tinct, owing to the beginning imperfection of our &s;ight, we are induced <HI>voluntarily</HI> to attend to them; and then the&s;e apparent motions become &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation; and thus the other parts of the trains of irritative ideas, or irritative mu&s;cular motions, become di&s;ordered, as explained above. In the&s;e ca&s;es of &s;light vertigo I have always promi&s;ed my patients, that they would get free from it in two or three months, as they &s;hould acquire the habit of ba|lancing their bodies by le&s;s di&s;tinct objects, and have &s;eldom been mi&s;|taken in my progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>There is an auditory vertigo, which is called a noi&s;e in the head, explained in No. 7. of this &s;ection, which al&s;o is very liable to affect people in the advance of life, and is owing to their hearing le&s;s per|fectly than before. This is &s;ometimes called a ringing, and &s;ometimes a &s;inging, or buzzing, in the ears, and is occa&s;ioned by our fir&s;t ex|periencing a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation from our not being able di&s;tinctly to hear the &s;ounds, we u&s;ed formerly to hear di&s;tinctly. And this di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation excites de&s;ire and con&s;equent volition; and when we voluntarily attend to &s;mall indi&s;tinct &s;ounds, even the whi&s;per|ing of the air in a room, and the pul&s;ations of the arteries of the ear are &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation; which minute &s;ounds ought only to have produced irritative &s;en&s;ual motions, or unperceived ideas. See Section XVII. 3. 6. The&s;e patients after a while lo&s;e this auditory vertigo, by acquiring a new habit of not attending voluntarily to the&s;e indi|&s;tinct &s;ounds, but contenting them&s;elves with the le&s;s accuracy of their &s;en&s;e of hearing.</P>
<P>Another kind of vertigo begins with the di&s;ordered action of &s;ome irritative mu&s;cular motions, as tho&s;e of the &s;tomach from intoxication, or from emetics; or tho&s;e of the ureter, from the &s;timulus of a &s;tone lodged in it; and it is probable, that the di&s;ordered motions of &s;ome of the great congeries of glands, as of tho&s;e which form the liver, or of
<PB N="239" REF="253">
the inte&s;tinal canal, may occa&s;ion vertigo in con&s;equence of their mo|tions being a&s;&s;ociated or catenated with the great circles of irritative motions; and from hence it appears, that the means of cure mu&s;t be adapted to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s it is probable, that the habit of &s;winging for a week or two before going on &s;hipboard might be of &s;ervice. For the vertigo from failure of &s;ight, &s;pectacles may be u&s;ed. For the auditory vertigo, aether may be dropt into the ear to &s;timulate the part, or to di&s;&s;olve ear-wax, if &s;uch be a part of the cau&s;e. For the vertigo ari&s;ing from indige&s;tion, the peruvian bark and a bli&s;ter are re|commended. And for that owing to a &s;tone in the ureter, vene&s;ec|tion, cathartics, opiates, &s;al &s;oda aerated.</P>

IN the &s;tate of nature when the &s;en&s;e of hunger is appea&s;ed by the &s;timulus of agreeable food, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is over, and the human &s;avage is at peace with the world, he then exerts little attention to external objects, plea&s;ing reveries of imagination &s;uc|ceed, and at length &s;leep is the re&s;ult: till the nouri&s;hment which he has procured, is carried over every part of the &s;y&s;tem to repair the in|juries of action, and he awakens with fre&s;h vigour, and feels a renewal of his &s;en&s;e of hunger.</P>
<P>The juices of &s;ome bitter vegetables, as of the poppy and the lauro|cera&s;us, and the ardent &s;pirit produced in the fermentation of the &s;ugar found in vegetable juices, are &s;o agreeable to the nerves of the &s;tomach, that, taken in a &s;mall quantity, they in&s;tantly pacify the &s;en&s;e of hunger; and the inattention to external &s;timuli with the re|veries
<PB N="241" REF="255">
of imagination, and &s;leep, &s;ucceeds, in the &s;ame manner as when the &s;tomach is filled with other le&s;s intoxicating food.</P>
<P>This inattention to the irritative motions occa&s;ioned by external &s;ti|muli is a very important circum&s;tance in the approach of &s;leep, and is produced in young children by rocking their cradles: during which all vi&s;ible objects become indi&s;tinct to them. An uniform &s;oft re|peated &s;ound, as the murmurs of a gentle current, or of bees, are &s;aid to produce the &s;ame effect, by pre&s;enting indi&s;tinct ideas of in|con&s;equential &s;ounds, and by thus &s;tealing our attention from other objects, whil&s;t by their continued reiterations they become familiar them&s;elves, and we cea&s;e gradually to attend to any thing, and &s;leep en&s;ues.</P>
<P N="2">2. After great fatigue or inanition, when the &s;tomach is &s;uddenly filled with fle&s;h and vegetable food, the inattention to external &s;ti|muli, and the reveries of imagination, become &s;o con&s;picuous as to amount to a degree of intoxication. The &s;ame is at any time pro|duced by &s;uperadding a little wine or opium to our common meals; or by taking the&s;e &s;eparately in con&s;iderable quantity; and this more efficaciou&s;ly after fatigue or inanition; becau&s;e a le&s;s quantity of any &s;timulating material will excite an organ into energetic action, after it has lately been torpid from defect of &s;timulus; as objects appear more luminous, after we have been in the dark; and becau&s;e the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, which is the immediate cau&s;e of &s;leep, is &s;ooner induced, after a continued voluntary exertion has in part exhau&s;ted the &s;en&s;orial power of volition; in the &s;ame manner as we cannot contract a &s;ingle mu&s;cle long together without intervals of inaction.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the beginning of intoxication we are inclined to &s;leep, as men|tioned above, but by the excitement of external circum&s;tances, as of noi&s;e, light, bu&s;ine&s;s, or by the exertion of volition, we prevent the approaches of it, and continue to take into our &s;tomach greater quan|tities of the inebriating materials. By the&s;e means the irritative movements of the &s;tomach are excited into greater action than is na|tural;
<PB N="242" REF="256">
and in con&s;equence all the irritative tribes and trains of mo|tion, which are catenated with them, become &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;tronger action from their accu&s;tomed &s;timuli; becau&s;e the&s;e motions are ex|cited both by their u&s;ual irritation, and by their a&s;&s;ociation with the increa&s;ed actions of the &s;tomach and lacteals. Hence the &s;kin glows, and the heat of the body is increa&s;ed, by the more energetic action of the whole glandular &s;y&s;tem; and plea&s;ure is introduced in con&s;equence of the&s;e increa&s;ed motions from internal &s;timulus. According to Law, 5. Sect. IV. on Animal Cau&s;ation.</P>
<P>From this great increa&s;e of irritative motions from internal &s;timu|lus, and the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation introduced into the &s;y&s;tem in con&s;e|quence; and &s;econdly, from the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;itive motions in con&s;e|quence of this additional quantity of &s;en&s;ation, &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power is expended, that the voluntary power becomes feebly exerted, and the irritation from the &s;timulus of external objects is le&s;s forcible; the external parts of the eye are not therefore voluntarily adapted to the di&s;tances of objects, whence the apparent motions of tho&s;e objects either are &s;een double, or become too indi&s;tinct for the purpo&s;e of ba|lancing the body, and vertigo is induced.</P>
<P>Hence we become acquainted with that very curious circum&s;tance, why the drunken vertigo is attended with an increa&s;e of plea&s;ure; for the irritative ideas and motions occa&s;ioned by internal &s;timulus, that were not attended to in our &s;ober hours, are now ju&s;t &s;o much in|crea&s;ed as to be &s;ucceeded by plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, in the &s;ame man|ner as the more violent motions of our organs are &s;ucceeded by painful &s;en&s;ation. And hence a greater quantity of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is introduced into the con&s;titution; which is attended in &s;ome people with an increa&s;e of benevolence and good humour.</P>
<P>If the apparent motions of objects is much increa&s;ed, as when we revolve on one foot, or are &s;wung on a rope, the ideas of the&s;e ap|parent motions are al&s;o attended to, and are &s;ucceeded with plea&s;ure|able &s;en&s;ation, till they become familiar to us by frequent u&s;e. Hence
<PB N="243" REF="257">
children are at fir&s;t delighted with the&s;e kinds of exerci&s;e, and with riding, and &s;ailing, and hence rocking young children inclines them to &s;leep. For though in the vertigo from intoxication the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects are indi&s;tinct from their de|crea&s;e of energy: yet in the vertigo occa&s;ioned by rocking or &s;wing|ing the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects are increa&s;ed in energy, and hence they induce plea&s;ure into the &s;y&s;tem, but are equally indi&s;tinct, and in con&s;equence equally unfit to balance our|&s;elves by. This addition of plea&s;ure precludes de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, and in con&s;equence the voluntary power is feebly exerted, and on this ac|count rocking young children inclines them to &s;leep.</P>
<P>In what manner opium and wine act in relieving pain is another article, that well de&s;erves our attention. There are many pains that originate from defect as well as from exce&s;s of &s;timulus; of the&s;e are tho&s;e of the &s;ix appetites of hunger, thir&s;t, lu&s;t, the want of heat, of di&s;tention, and of fre&s;h air. Thus if our cutaneous capillaries cea&s;e to act from the dimini&s;hed &s;timulus of heat, when we are expo&s;ed to cold weather, or our &s;tomach is unea&s;y for want of food; the&s;e are both pains from defect of &s;timulus, and in con&s;equence opium, which &s;timulates all the moving &s;y&s;tem into increa&s;ed action, mu&s;t relieve them. But this is not the ca&s;e in tho&s;e pains, which ari&s;e from exce&s;s of &s;timulus, as in violent inflammations: in the&s;e the exhibition of opium is frequently injurious by increa&s;ing the action of the &s;y&s;tem already too great, as in inflammation of the bowels mortification is often produced by the &s;timulus of opium. Where, however, no &s;uch bad con&s;equences follow; the &s;timulus of opium, by increa&s;ing all the motions of the &s;y&s;tem, expends &s;o much of the &s;en&s;orial power, that the actions of the whole &s;y&s;tem &s;oon become feebler, and in con&s;e|quence tho&s;e which produced the pain and inflammation.</P>
<P N="4">4. When intoxication proceeds a little further, the quantity of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is &s;o far increa&s;ed, that all de&s;ire cea&s;es, for there is no pain in the &s;y&s;tem to excite it. Hence the voluntary exertions
<PB N="244" REF="258">
are dimini&s;hed, &s;taggering and &s;tammering &s;ucceed; and the trains of ideas become more and more incon&s;i&s;tent from this defect of voluntary exertion, as explained in the &s;ections on &s;leep and reverie, whil&s;t tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are unmixed with volition are more vividly felt, and &s;hewn with le&s;s re&s;erve; hence pining love, or &s;uper&s;titious fear, and the maudling tear dropped on the remembrance of the mo&s;t trifling di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. At length all the&s;e circum&s;tances are increa&s;ed; the quantity of plea&s;ure introduced into the &s;y&s;tem by the increa&s;ed irritative mu&s;cu|lar motions of the whole &s;anguiferous, and glandular, and ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tems, becomes &s;o great, that the organs of &s;en&s;e are more forcibly excited into action by this internal plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, than by the irritation from the &s;timulus of external objects. Hence the drunkard cea&s;es to attend to external &s;timuli, and as volition is now al&s;o &s;u&s;pend|ed, the trains of his ideas become totally incon&s;i&s;tent as in dreams, or delirium: and at length a &s;tupor &s;ucceeds from the great exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, which probably does not even admit of dreams, and in which, as in apoplexy, no motions continue but tho&s;e from internal &s;timuli, from &s;en&s;ation, and from a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="6">6. In other people a paroxy&s;m of drunkenne&s;s has another termina|tion; the inebriate, as &s;oon as he begins to be vertiginous, makes pale urine in great quantities and very frequently, and at length becomes &s;ick, vomits repeatedly, or purges, or has profu&s;e &s;weats, and a tem|porary fever en&s;ues with a quick &s;trong pul&s;e. This in &s;ome hours is &s;ucceeded by &s;leep; but the unfortunate bacchanalian does not perfectly recover him&s;elf till about the &s;ame time of the &s;ucceeding day, when his cour&s;e of inebriation began. As &s;hewn in Sect. XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation. The temporary fever with &s;trong pul&s;e is owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e as the glow on the &s;kin mentioned in the third paragraph of this Section: the flow of urine and &s;ickne&s;s ari&s;es from the whole &s;y&s;tem of irritative motions being thrown into confu&s;ion by their a&s;&s;o|ciations with each other; as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, mentioned in Sect. XX. 4.
<PB N="245" REF="259">
on Vertigo; and which is more fully explained in Section XXIX. on Diabetes.</P>
<P N="7">7. In this vertigo from internal cau&s;es we &s;ee objects double, as two candles in&s;tead of one, which is thus explained. Two lines drawn through the axes of our two eyes meet at the object we attend to: this angle of the optic axes increa&s;es or dimini&s;hes with the le&s;s or greater di&s;tances of objects. All objects before or behind the place where this angle is formed, appear double; as any one may ob&s;erve by holding up a pen between his eyes and the candle; when he looks attentively at a &s;pot on the pen, and carele&s;sly at the candle, it will appear double; and the rever&s;e when he looks attentively at the candle and carele&s;sly at the pen; &s;o that in this ca&s;e the mu&s;cles of the eye, like tho&s;e of the limbs, &s;tagger and are di&s;obedient to the expiring ef|forts of volition. Numerous objects are indeed &s;ometimes &s;een by the inebriate, occa&s;ioned by the refractions made by the tears, which &s;tand upon his eye-lids.</P>
<P N="8">8. This vertigo al&s;o continues, when the inebriate lies in his bed, in the dark, or with his eyes clo&s;ed; and this more powerfully than when he is erect, and in the light. For the irritative ideas of the ap|parent motions of objects are now excited by irritation from internal &s;timulus, or by a&s;&s;ociation with other irritative motions; and the in|ebriate, like one in a dream, believes the objects of the&s;e irritative mo|tions to be pre&s;ent, and feels him&s;elf vertiginous. I have ob&s;erved in this &s;ituation, &s;o long as my eyes and mind were intent upon a book, the &s;ickne&s;s and vertigo cea&s;ed, and were renewed again the moment I di&s;continued this attention; as was explained in the preceding ac|count of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. Some drunken people have been known to be|come &s;ober in&s;tantly from &s;ome accident, that has &s;trongly excited their attention, as the pain of a broken bone, or the news of their hou&s;e being on fire.</P>
<P N="9">9. Sometimes the vertigo from internal cau&s;es, as from intoxica|tion, or at the beginning of &s;ome fevers, becomes &s;o univer&s;al, that
<PB N="246" REF="260">
the irritative motions which belong to other organs of &s;en&s;e are &s;uc|ceeded by &s;en&s;ation or attention, as well as tho&s;e of the eye. The vertiginous noi&s;e in the ears has been explained in Section XX. on Vertigo. The ta&s;te of the &s;aliva, which in general is not attended to, becomes perceptible, and the patients complain of a bad ta&s;te in their mouth.</P>
<P>The common &s;mells of the &s;urrounding air &s;ometimes excite the at|tention of the&s;e patients, and bad &s;mells are complained of, which to other people are imperceptible. The irritative motions that belong to the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;&s;ure, or of touch, are attended to, and the patient conceives the bed to librate, and is fearful of falling out of it. The irritative motions belonging to the &s;en&s;es of di&s;tention, and of heat, like tho&s;e above mentioned, become attended to at this time: hence we feel the pul&s;ation of our arteries all over us, and complain of heat, or of cold, in parts of the body where there is no accumulation or di|minution of actual heat. All which are to be explained, as in the la&s;t paragraph, by the irritative ideas belonging to the various &s;en&s;es being now excited by internal &s;timuli, or by their a&s;&s;ociations with other ir|ritative motions. And that the inebriate, like one in a dream, be|lieves the external objects, which u&s;ually cau&s;ed the&s;e irritative ideas, to be now pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="10">10. The di&s;ea&s;es in con&s;equence of frequent inebriety, or of daily taking much vinous &s;pirit without inebriety, con&s;i&s;t in the paraly&s;is, which is liable to &s;ucceed violent &s;timulation. Organs, who&s;e actions are a&s;&s;ociated with others, are frequently more affected than the organ, which is &s;timulated into too violent action. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. Hence in drunken people it generally happens, that the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the liver become fir&s;t paralytic, and a torpor with con&s;equent gall|&s;tones or &s;chirrus of this vi&s;cus is induced with concomitant jaundice; otherwi&s;e it becomes inflamed in con&s;equence of previous torpor, and this inflammation is frequently transferred to a more &s;en&s;ible part, which is a&s;&s;ociated with it, and produces the gout, or the ro&s;y eruption of
<PB N="247" REF="261">
the face, or &s;ome other leprous eruption on the head, or arms, or legs. Sometimes the &s;tomach is fir&s;t affected, and paraly&s;is of the lacteal &s;y&s;tem is induced; whence a total abhorrence from fle&s;h-food, and general emaciation. In others the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem is affected with paraly&s;is, and drop&s;y is the con&s;equence. In &s;ome inebriates the tor|por of the liver produces pain without apparent &s;chirrus, or gall-&s;tones, or inflammation, or con&s;equent gout, and in the&s;e epilep&s;y or in&s;anity are often the con&s;equence. All which will be more fully treated of in the cour&s;e of the work.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that it is a common opinion, that the gout is as frequently owing to gluttony in eating, as to intemperance in drink|ing fermented or &s;pirituous liquors. To this I an&s;wer, that I have &s;een no per&s;on afflicted with the gout, who has not drank freely of fermented liquor, as wine and water, or &s;mall beer; though as the di&s;po&s;ition to all the di&s;ea&s;es, which have originated from intoxication, is in &s;ome degree hereditary, a le&s;s quantity of &s;pirituous potation will induce the gout in tho&s;e, who inherit the di&s;po&s;ition from their pa|rents. To which I mu&s;t add, that in young people the rheumati&s;m is frequently mi&s;taken for the gout.</P>
<P>Spice is &s;eldom taken in &s;uch quantity as to do any material injury to the &s;y&s;tem, fle&s;h-meats as well as vegetables are the natural diet of mankind; with the&s;e a glutton may be crammed up to the throat, and fed fat like a &s;talled ox; but he will not be di&s;ea&s;ed, unle&s;s he adds &s;pirituous or fermented liquor to his food. This is well known in the di&s;tilleries, where the &s;wine, which are fattened by the &s;pirituous &s;e|diments of barrels, acquire di&s;ea&s;ed livers. But mark what happens to a man, who drinks a quart of wine or of ale, if he has not been habituated to it. He lo&s;es the u&s;e both of his limbs and of his under|&s;tanding! He becomes a temporary idiot, and has a temporary &s;troke of the pal&s;y! And though he &s;lowly recovers after &s;ome hours, is it not rea&s;onable to conclude, that a perpetual repetition of &s;o powerful a poi&s;on mu&s;t at length permanently affect him?&mdash;If a per&s;on acciden|tally
<PB N="248" REF="262">
becomes intoxicated by eating a few mu&s;hrooms of a peculiar kind, a general alarm is excited, and he is &s;aid to be poi&s;oned, and emetics are exhibited; but &s;o familiari&s;ed are we to the intoxication from vinous &s;pirit, that it occa&s;ions laughter rather than alarm.</P>
<P>There is however con&s;iderable danger in too ha&s;tily di&s;continuing the u&s;e of &s;o &s;trong a &s;timulus, le&s;t the torpor of the &s;y&s;tem, or para|ly&s;is, &s;hould &s;ooner be induced by the omi&s;&s;ion than by the continu|ance of this habit, when unfortunately acquired. A golden rule for determining the quantity, which may with &s;afety be di&s;continued, is delivered in Sect. XII. 7. 8.</P>

<P>I. 1. IN the hemiplagia, when the limbs on one &s;ide have lo&s;t their power of voluntary motion, the patient is for many days per|petually employed in moving tho&s;e of the other. 2. When the vo|luntary power is &s;u&s;pended during &s;leep, there commences a cea&s;ele&s;s flow of &s;en&s;itive motions, or ideas of imagination, which compo&s;e our dreams. 3.

<P>Be&s;ides the very great quantity of &s;en&s;orial power perpetually pro|duced and expended in moving the arterial, venous, and glandular
<PB N="250" REF="264">
&s;y&s;tems, with the various organs of dige&s;tion, as de&s;cribed in Section XXXII. 3. 2. there is al&s;o a con&s;tant expenditure of it by the ac|tion of our locomotive mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e. Thus the thick|ne&s;s of the optic nerves, where they enter the eye, and the great ex|pan&s;ion of the nerves of touch beneath the whole of the cuticle, evince the great con&s;umption of &s;en&s;orial power by the&s;e &s;en&s;es. And our perpetual mu&s;cular actions in the common offices of life, and in con&s;tantly pre&s;erving the perpendicularity of our bodies during the day, evince a con&s;iderable expenditure of the &s;pirit of animation by our locomotive mu&s;cles. It follows, that if the exertion of the&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cles be for a while intermitted, that &s;ome quantity of &s;en&s;orial power mu&s;t be accumulated, and a propen&s;ity to activity of &s;ome kind en&s;ue from the increa&s;ed excitability of the &s;y&s;tem. Whence proceeds the irk&s;omene&s;s of a continued attitude, and of an indolent life.</P>
<P>However &s;mall this hourly accumulation of the &s;pirit of animation may be, it produces a propen&s;ity to &s;ome kind of action; but it never|thele&s;s requires either de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, either plea&s;ure or pain, or &s;ome external &s;timulus, or a previous link of a&s;&s;ociation, to excite the &s;y&s;tem into activity; thus it frequently happens, when the mind and body are &s;o unemployed as not to po&s;&s;e&s;s any of the three fir&s;t kinds of &s;timuli, that the la&s;t takes place, and con&s;umes the &s;mall but per|petual accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power. Whence &s;ome indolent peo|ple repeat the &s;ame ver&s;e for hours together, or hum the &s;ame tune. Thus the poet:

<P>II. The repetitions of motions may be at fir&s;t produced either by volition, or by &s;en&s;ation, or by irritation, but they &s;oon become ea&s;ier to perform than any other kinds of action, becau&s;e they &s;oon become a&s;&s;ociated together, according to Law the &s;eventh, Section IV. on

Animal Cau&s;ation. And becau&s;e their frequency of repetition, if as much &s;en&s;orial power be produced during every reiteration as is ex|pended, adds to the facility of their production.</P>
<P>If a &s;timulus be repeated at uniform intervals of time, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XII. 3. 3. the action, whether of our mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e, is produced with &s;till greater facility or energy; becau&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, mentioned above, is combined with the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation; that is, in common language, the ac|quired habit a&s;&s;i&s;ts the power of the &s;timulus.</P>
<P>This not only obtains in the annual, lunar, and diurnal catenations of animal motions, as explained in Sect. XXXVI. which are thus performed with great facility and energy; but in every le&s;s circle of actions or ideas, as in the burthen of a &s;ong, or the reiterations of a dance. To the facility and di&s;tinctne&s;s, with which we hear &s;ounds at repeated intervals, we owe the plea&s;ure, which we receive from mu&s;ical time, and from poetic time; as de&s;cribed in Botanic Garden, P. 2. Interlude 3. And to this the plea&s;ure we receive from the rhimes and alliterations of modern ver&s;ification; the &s;ource of which without this key would be difficult to di&s;cover.

<P>There is no variety of notes referable to the gamut in the beating of the drum, yet if it be performed in mu&s;ical time, it is agreeable to our ears; and therefore this plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation mu&s;t be owing to the repetition of the divi&s;ions of the &s;ounds at certain intervals of time, or mu&s;ical bars. Whether the&s;e times or bars are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a pau&s;e, or by an empha&s;is, or accent, certain it is, that this di&s;tinction is perpetually repeated; otherwi&s;e the ear could not determine in&s;tant|ly, whether the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of &s;ound were in common or in triple time. In common time there is a divi&s;ion between every two crotchets, or
<PB N="252" REF="266">
other notes of equivalent time; though the bar in written mu&s;ic is put after every fourth crotchet, or notes equivalent in time; in triple time the divi&s;ion or bar is after every three crotchets, or notes equi|valent; &s;o that in common time the repetition recurs more frequently than in triple time. The grave or heroic ver&s;es of the Greek and Latin poets are written in common time; the French heroic ver&s;es, and Mr. An&s;tie's humorous ver&s;es in his bath guide, are written in the &s;ame time as the Greek and Latin ver&s;es, but are one bar &s;horter. The Engli&s;h grave or heroic ver&s;es are mea&s;ured by triple time, as Mr. Pope's tran&s;lation of Homer.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e little circles of mu&s;ical time, there are the greater returning periods, and the &s;till more di&s;tant choru&s;es, which, like the rhimes at the ends of ver&s;es, owe their beauty to repetition; that is, to the facility and di&s;tinctne&s;s with which we perceive &s;ounds, which we expect to perceive, or have perceived before; or in the language of this work, to the greater ea&s;e and energy with which our organ is excited by the combined &s;en&s;orial powers of a&s;&s;ociation and irritation, than by the latter &s;ingly.</P>
<P>A certain uniformity or repetition of parts enters the very compo|&s;ition of harmony. Thus two octaves neare&s;t to each other in the &s;cale commence their vibrations together after every &s;econd vibration of the higher one. And where the fir&s;t, third, and fifth compo&s;e a chord the vibrations concur or coincide frequently, though le&s;s &s;o than in the two octaves. It is probable that the&s;e chords bear &s;ome analogy to a mixture of three alternate colours in the &s;un's &s;pectrum &s;eparated by a pri&s;m.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure we receive from a melodious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of notes refer|able to the gamut is derived from another &s;ource, viz. to the pandi|culation or counteraction of antagoni&s;t fibres. See Botanic Garden, P. 2. Interlude 3. If to the&s;e be added our early a&s;&s;ociations of agree|able ideas with certain proportions of &s;ound, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the&s;e
<PB N="253" REF="267">
three &s;ources &s;prings all the delight of mu&s;ic, &s;o celebrated by ancient authors, and &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tically cultivated at pre&s;ent. See Sect. XVI. No. 10. on In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>This kind of plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from repetition, that is from the faci|lity and di&s;tinctne&s;s, with which we perceive and under&s;tand repeated &s;en&s;ations, enters into all the agreeable arts; and when it is carried to exce&s;s is termed formality. The art of dancing like that of mu&s;ic de|pends for a great part of the plea&s;ure, it affords, on repetition; ar|chitecture, e&s;pecially the Grecian, con&s;i&s;ts of one part being a repe|tition of another; and hence the beauty of the pyramidal outline in land&s;cape-painting; where one &s;ide of the picture may be &s;aid in &s;ome mea&s;ure to balance the other. So univer&s;ally does repetition contribute to our plea&s;ure in the fine arts, that beauty it&s;elf has been defined by &s;ome writers to con&s;i&s;t in a due combination of uniformity and variety.

<P N="1">III. 1. Man is termed by Ari&s;totle an imitative animal; this pro|pen&s;ity to imitation not only appears in the actions of children, but in all the cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of the world; many thou&s;ands tread in the beaten paths of others, for one who traver&s;es regions of his own di&s;covery. The origin of this propen&s;ity to imitation has not, that I recollect, been deduced from any known principle; when any action pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the view of a child, as of whetting a knife, or thread|ing a needle, the parts of this action in re&s;pect of time, motion, fi|gure, is imitated by a part of the retina of his eye; to perform this action therefore with his hands is ea&s;ier to him than to invent any new action, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in repeating with another &s;et of fibres, viz. with the moving mu&s;cles, what he had ju&s;t performed by &s;ome parts of the retina; ju&s;t as in dancing we transfer the times of mo|tion from the actions of the auditory nerves to the mu&s;cles of the limbs. Imitation therefore con&s;i&s;ts of repetition, which we have &s;hewn above to be the ea&s;ie&s;t kind of animal action, and which we
<PB N="254" REF="268">
perpetually fall into, when we po&s;&s;e&s;s an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, which is not otherwi&s;e called into exertion.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn, that our ideas are configurations of the organs of &s;en&s;e, produced originally in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of exter|nal bodies. And that the&s;e ideas, or configurations of the organs of &s;en&s;e, re&s;emble in &s;ome property a corre&s;pondent property of external matter; as the parts of the &s;en&s;es of &s;ight and of touch, which are excited into action, re&s;emble in figure the figure of the &s;timulating body; and probably al&s;o the colour, and the quantity of den&s;ity, which they perceive. As explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. Hence it ap|pears, that our perceptions them&s;elves are copies, that is, imitations of &s;ome properties of external matter; and the propen&s;ity to imitation is thus interwoven with our exi&s;tence, as it is produced by the &s;timuli of external bodies, and is afterwards repeated by our volitions and &s;en|&s;ations, and thus con&s;titutes all the operations of our minds.</P>
<P N="2">2. Imitations re&s;olve them&s;elves into four kinds, voluntary, &s;en&s;i|tive, irritative, and a&s;&s;ociate. The voluntary imitations are, when we imitate deliberately the actions of others, either by mimicry, as in acting a play, or in delineating a flower; or in the common actions of our lives, as in our dre&s;s, cookery, language, manners, and even in our habits of thinking.</P>
<P>Not only the greate&s;t part of mankind learn all the common arts of life by imitating others, but brute animals &s;eem capable of acquiring knowledge with greater facility by imitating each other, than by any methods by which we can teach them; as dogs and cats, when they are &s;ick, learn of each other to eat gra&s;s; and I &s;uppo&s;e, that by making an artificial dog perform certain tricks, as in dancing on his hinder legs, a living dog might be ea&s;ily induced to imitate them; and that the readie&s;t way of in&s;tructing dumb animals is by practi&s;ing them with others of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which have already learned the arts we wi&s;h to teach them. The important u&s;e of imitation in ac|quiring
<PB N="255" REF="269">
natural language is mentioned in Section XVI. 7. and 8. on In&s;tinct.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;en&s;itive imitations are the immediate con&s;equences of plea|&s;ure or pain, and the&s;e are often produced even contrary to the efforts of the will. Thus many young men on &s;eeing cruel &s;urgical opera|tions become &s;ick, and &s;ome even feel pain in the parts of their own bodies, which they &s;ee tortured or wounded in others; that is, they in &s;ome mea&s;ure imitate by the exertions of their own fibres the vio|lent actions, which they witne&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e of others. In this ca&s;e a double imitation takes place, fir&s;t the ob&s;erver imitates with the ex|tremities of the optic nerve the mangled limbs, which are pre&s;ent be|fore his eyes; then by a &s;econd imitation he excites &s;o violent action of the fibres of his own limbs as to produce pain in tho&s;e parts of his own body, which he &s;aw wounded in another. In the&s;e pains pro|duced by imitation the effect has &s;ome &s;imilarity to the cau&s;e, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from tho&s;e produced by a&s;&s;ociation; as the pains of the teeth, called tooth-edge, which are produced by a&s;&s;ociation with di&s;agreeable &s;ounds, as explained in Sect. XVI. 10.</P>
<P>The effect of this powerful agent, imitation, in the moral world, is mentioned in Sect. XVI. 7. as it is the foundation of all our intel|lectual &s;ympathies with the pains and plea&s;ures of others, and is in con&s;equence the &s;ource of all our virtues. For in what con&s;i&s;ts our &s;ympathy with the mi&s;eries, or with the joys, of our fellow creatures, but in an involuntary excitation of ideas in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;imilar or imitative of tho&s;e, which we believe to exi&s;t in the minds of the per|&s;ons, whom we commi&s;erate or congratulate?</P>
<P>There are certain concurrent or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive actions of &s;ome of the glands, or other parts of the body, which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ation, which become intelligible from this propen&s;ity to imitation. Of the&s;e are the production of matter by the membranes of the fauces, or by the &s;kin, in con&s;equence of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e previou&s;ly affecting
<PB N="256" REF="270">
the parts of generation. Since as no fever is excited, and as neither the blood of &s;uch patients, nor even the matter from ulcers of the throat, or from cutaneous ulcers, will by inoculation produce the ve|nereal di&s;ea&s;e in others, as ob&s;erved by Mr. Hunter, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that no contagious matter is conveyed thither by the blood-ve&s;&s;els, but that a milder matter is formed by the actions of the fine ve&s;&s;els in tho&s;e membranes imitating each other. See Section XXXIII. 2. 9. In this di&s;ea&s;e the actions of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els producing ulcers on the throat and &s;kin are imperfect imitations of tho&s;e pro|ducing chanker, or gonorrhoea; &s;ince the matter produced by them is not infectious, while the imitative actions in the hydrophobia ap|pear to be perfect re&s;emblances, as they produce a material equally in|fectious with the original one, which induced them.</P>
<P>The contagion from the bite of a mad dog differs from other con|tagious materials, from its being communicable from other animals to mankind, and from many animals to each other; the phenomena at|tending the hydrophobia are in &s;ome degree explicable on the fore|going theory. The infectious matter does not appear to enter the circulation, as it cannot be traced along the cour&s;e of the lymphatics from the wound, nor is there any &s;welling of the lymphatic glands, nor does any fever attend, as occurs in the &s;mall-pox, and in many other contagious di&s;ea&s;es; yet by &s;ome unknown proce&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e is communicated from the wound to the throat, and that many months after the injury, &s;o as to produce pain and hydrophobia, with a &s;ecre|tion of infectious &s;aliva of the &s;ame kind, as that of the mad dog, which inflicted the wound.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is very intricate.&mdash;It would appear, that by certain morbid actions of the &s;alivary glands of the mad dog, a peculiar kind of &s;aliva is produced; which being in&s;tilled into a wound of another animal &s;timulates the cutaneous or mucous glands into morbid actions, but which are ineffectual in re&s;pect to the production of a &s;imilar con|tagious
<PB N="257" REF="271">
material; but the &s;alivary glands by irritative &s;ympathy are thrown into &s;imilar action, and produce an infectious &s;aliva &s;imilar to that in&s;tilled into the wound.</P>
<P>Though in many contagious fevers a material &s;imilar to that which produced the di&s;ea&s;e, is thus generated by imitation; yet there are other infectious materials, which do not thus propagate them&s;elves, but which &s;eem to act like &s;low poi&s;ons. Of this kind was the con|tagious matter, which produced the jail-fever at the a&s;&s;izes at Oxford about a century ago. Which, though fatal to &s;o many, was not communicated to their nur&s;es or attendants. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the imi|tations of the fine ve&s;&s;els, as above de&s;cribed, appear to be imperfect, and do not therefore produce a matter &s;imilar to that, which &s;timulates them; in this circum&s;tance re&s;embling the venereal matter in ulcers of the throat or &s;kin, according to the curious di&s;covery of Mr. Hun|ter above related, who found, by repeated inoculations, that it would not infect. Hunter on Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, Part vi. ch. 1.</P>
<P>Another example of morbid imitation is in the production of a great quantity of contagious matter, as in the inoculated &s;mall-pox, from a &s;mall quantity of it in&s;erted into the arm, and probably diffu&s;ed in the blood. The&s;e particles of contagious matter &s;timulate the extremities of the fine arteries of the &s;kin, and cau&s;e them to imitate &s;ome pro|perties of tho&s;e particles of contagious matter, &s;o as to produce a thou|&s;andfold of a &s;imilar material. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 6. Other in|&s;tances are mentioned in the Section on Generation, which &s;hew the probability that the extremities of the &s;eminal glands may imitate cer|tain ideas of the mind, or actions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, and thus oc|ca&s;ion the male or female &s;ex of the embryon. See Sect. XXXIX. 6.</P>
<P N="4">4. We come now to tho&s;e imitations, which are not attended with &s;en&s;ation. Of the&s;e are all the irritative ideas already explained, as when the retina of the eye imitates by its action or configuration the tree or the bench, which I &s;hun in walking pa&s;t without attending to them. Other examples of the&s;e irritative imitations are daily ob|&s;ervable
<PB N="258" REF="272">
in common life: thus one yawning per&s;on &s;hall &s;et a whole company a yawning; and &s;ome have acquired winking of the eyes or impediments of &s;peech by imitating their companions without being con&s;cious of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ides the three &s;pecies of imitations above de&s;cribed there may be &s;ome a&s;&s;ociate motions, which may imitate each other in the kind as well as in the quantity of their action; but it is difficult to di&s;|tingui&s;h them from the a&s;&s;ociations of motions treated of in Section XXXV. Where the actions of other per&s;ons are imitated there can be no doubt, or where we imitate a preconceived idea by exertion of our locomotive mu&s;cles, as in painting a dragon; all the&s;e imitations may aptly be referred to the &s;ources above de&s;cribed of the propen&s;ity to activity, and the facility of repetition; at the &s;ame time I do not af|firm, that all tho&s;e other apparent &s;en&s;itive and irritative imitations may not be re&s;olvable into a&s;&s;ociations of a peculiar kind, in which certain di&s;tant parts of &s;imilar irritability or &s;en&s;ibility, and which have habitually acted together, may affect each other exactly with the &s;ame kinds of motion; as many parts are known to &s;ympathi&s;e in the quan|tity of their motions. And that therefore they may be ultimately re|&s;olvable into a&s;&s;ociations of action, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXV.</P>

<P>I. WE now &s;tep forwards to illu&s;trate &s;ome of the phaenomena of di&s;ea&s;es, and to trace out their mo&s;t efficacious methods of cure; and &s;hall commence this &s;ubject with a &s;hort de&s;cription of the circulatory &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>As the nerves, who&s;e extremities form our various organs of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cles, are all joined, or communicate, by means of the brain, for the convenience perhaps of the di&s;tribution of a &s;ubtile ethereal fluid for the purpo&s;e of motion; &s;o all tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els of the body, which carry the gro&s;&s;er fluids for the purpo&s;es of nutrition, communi|cate with each other by the heart.</P>
<P>The heart and arteries are hollow mu&s;cles, and are therefore in|dued with power of contraction in con&s;equence of &s;timulus, like all other mu&s;cular &s;ibres; but, as they have no antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles, the cavities of the ve&s;&s;els, which they form, would remain for ever
<PB N="260" REF="274">
clo&s;ed, after they have contracted them&s;elves, unle&s;s &s;ome extraneous power be applied to again di&s;tend them. This extraneous power in re&s;pect to the heart is the current of blood, which is perpetually ab|&s;orbed by the veins from the various glands and capillaries, and pu&s;hed into the heart by a power probably very &s;imilar to that, which rai&s;es the &s;ap in vegetables in the &s;pring, which, according to Dr. Hale's experiment on the &s;tump of a vine, exerted a force equal to a column of water above twenty feet high. This force of the current of blood in the veins is partly produced by their ab&s;orbent power, ex|erted at the beginning of every fine ramification; which may be con|ceived to be a mouth ab&s;orbing blood, as the mouths of the lacteals and lymphatics ab&s;orb chyle and lymph. And partly by their inter|mitted compre&s;&s;ion by the pul&s;ations of their generally concomitant ar|teries; by which the blood is perpetually propelled towards the heart, as the valves in many veins, and the ab&s;orbent mouths in them all, will not &s;uffer it to return.</P>
<P>The blood, thus forcibly injected into the chambers of the heart, di&s;tends this combination of hollow mu&s;cles; till by the &s;timulus of di&s;tention they contract them&s;elves; and, pu&s;hing forwards the blood into the arteries, exert &s;ufficient force to overcome in le&s;s than a &s;econd of time the vis inertiae, and perhaps &s;ome ela&s;ticity, of the very exten&s;ive ramifications of the two great &s;y&s;tems of the aortal and pul|monary arteries. The power nece&s;&s;ary to do this in &s;o &s;hort a time mu&s;t be con&s;iderable, and has been variou&s;ly e&s;timated by different phy&s;iologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The mu&s;cular coats of the arterial &s;y&s;tem are then brought into ac|tion by the &s;timulus of di&s;tention, and propel the blood to the mouths, or through the convolutions, which precede the &s;ecretory apertures of the various glands and capillaries.</P>
<P>In the ve&s;&s;els of the liver there is no intervention of the heart; but the vena portarum, which does the office of an artery, is di&s;tended by the blood poured into it from the me&s;enteric veins, and is by this
<PB N="261" REF="275">
di&s;tention &s;timulated to contract it&s;elf, and propel the blood to the mouths of the numerous glands, which compo&s;e that vi&s;cus.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The glandular &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els may be divided into tho&s;e, which take &s;ome fluid from the circulation; and tho&s;e, which give &s;omething to it. Tho&s;e, which take their fluid from the circulation, are the various glands, by which the tears, bile, urine, per&s;piration, and many other &s;ecretions are produced; the&s;e glands probably con&s;i&s;t of a mouth to &s;elect, a belly to dige&s;t, and an excretory aperture to emit their appropriated fluids; the blood is conveyed by the power of the heart and arteries to the mouths of the&s;e glands, it is there taken up by the living power of the gland, and carried forwards to its belly, and excretory aperture, where a part is &s;eparated, and the remainder ab&s;orbed by the veins for further purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e glands are furni&s;hed with long convoluted necks or tubes, as the &s;eminal ones, which are curiou&s;ly &s;een when injected with quick&s;ilver. Others &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t of &s;horter tubes, as that great congeries of glands, which con&s;titute the liver, and tho&s;e of the kidneys. Some have their excretory apertures opening into re&s;ervoirs, as the urinary and gall-bladders. And others on the external body, as tho&s;e which &s;ecret the tears, and per&s;pirable matter.</P>
<P>Another great &s;y&s;tem of glands, which have very &s;hort necks, are the capillary ve&s;&s;els; by which the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is &s;ecreted on the &s;kin; and the mucus of various con&s;i&s;tences, which lubricates the inter&s;tices of the cellular membrane, of the mu&s;cular fibres, and of all the larger cavities of the body. From the want of a long con|volution of ve&s;&s;els &s;ome have doubted, whether the&s;e capillaries &s;hould be con&s;idered as glands, and have been led to conclude, that the per|&s;pirable matter rather exuded than was &s;ecreted. But the fluid of per&s;piration is not &s;imple water, though that part of it which exhales into the air may be &s;uch; for there is another part of it, which in a &s;tate of health is ab&s;orbed again; but which, when the ab&s;orbents are
<PB N="262" REF="276">
di&s;ea&s;ed, remains on the &s;urface of the &s;kin, in the form of &s;curf, or indurated mucus. Another thing, which &s;hews their &s;imilitude to other glands, is their &s;en&s;ibility to certain affections of the mind; as is &s;een in the deeper colour of the &s;kin in the blu&s;h of &s;hame, or the greater palene&s;s of it from fear.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>III. Another &s;eries of glandular ve&s;&s;els is called the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem; the&s;e open their mouths into all the cavities, and upon all tho&s;e &s;urfaces of the body, where the excretory apertures of the other glands pour out their fluids. The mouths of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem drink up a part or the whole of the&s;e fluids, and carry them forwards by their living power to their re&s;pective glands, which are called conglobate glands. There the&s;e fluids undergo &s;ome change, before they pa&s;s on into the circulation; but if they are very acrid, the conglobate gland &s;wells, and &s;ometimes &s;uppurates, as in inocu|lation of the &s;mall-pox, in the plague, and in venereal ab&s;orptions; at other times the fluid may perhaps continue there, till it undergoes &s;ome chemical change, that renders it le&s;s noxious; or, what is more likely, till it is regurgitated by the retrograde motion of the gland in &s;pontaneous &s;weats or diarrhoeas, as di&s;agreeing food is vomited from the &s;tomach.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<P>IV. As all the fluids, that pa&s;s through the&s;e glands, and capillary ve&s;&s;els, undergo a chemical change, acquiring new combinations, the matter of heat is at the &s;ame time given out; this is apparent, &s;ince whatever increa&s;es in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, increa&s;es the heat of the &s;kin; and when the action of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els is much increa&s;ed but for a moment, as in blu&s;hing, a vivid heat on the &s;kin is the immedi|ate con&s;equence. So when great bilious &s;ecretions, or tho&s;e of any other gland, are produced, heat is generated in the part in proportion to the quantity of the &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>The heat produced on the &s;kin by blu&s;hing may be thought by &s;ome too &s;udden to be pronounced a chemical effect, as the fermenta|tions
<PB N="263" REF="277">
or new combinations taking place in a fluid is in general a &s;lower proce&s;s. Yet are there many chemical mixtures in which heat is given out as in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; as in &s;olutions of metals in acids, or in mixtures of e&s;&s;ential oils and acids, as of oil of cloves and acid of nitre. So the brui&s;ed parts of an unripe apple become almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly &s;weet; and if the chemico-animal proce&s;s of dige&s;tion be &s;topped for but a moment, as by fear, or even by voluntary eructa|tion, a great quantity of air is generated, by the fermentation, which in&s;tantly &s;ucceeds the &s;top of dige&s;tion. By the experiments of Dr. Hales it appears, that an apple during fermentation gave up above &s;ix hundred times its bulk of air; and the materials in the &s;tomach are &s;uch, and in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as immediately to run into fermenta|tion, when dige&s;tion is impeded.</P>
<P>As the blood pa&s;&s;es through the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, which connect the pulmonary artery and vein, it undergoes a change of co|lour from a dark to a light red; which may be termed a chemical change, as it is known to be effected by an admixture of oxygene, or vital air; which, according to a di&s;covery of Dr. Prie&s;tley, pa&s;&s;es through the moi&s;t membranes, which con&s;titute the &s;ides of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. As the blood pa&s;&s;es through the capillary ve&s;&s;els, and glands, which connect the aorta and its various branches with their corre|&s;pondent veins in the extremities of the body, it again lo&s;es the bright red colour, and undergoes &s;ome new combinations in the glands or capillaries, in which the matter of heat is given out from the &s;ecreted fluids. This proce&s;s therefore, as well as the proce&s;s of re&s;piration, has &s;ome analogy to combu&s;tion, as the vital air or oxygene &s;eems to become united to &s;ome inflammable ba&s;e, and the matter of heat e&s;capes from the new acid, which is thus produced.</P>

corre&s;ponding with the remifications of the arterial &s;y&s;tem. At the extremity of the fine convolutions of the glands the arterial force cea&s;es; this in re&s;pect to the capillary ve&s;&s;els, which unite the extre|mities of the arteries with the commencement of the veins, is evident to the eye, on viewing the tail of a tadpole by means of a &s;olar, or even by a common micro&s;cope, for globules of blood are &s;een to en|deavour to pa&s;s, and to return again and again, before they become ab&s;orbed by the mouths of the veins; which returning of the&s;e glo|bules evinces, that the arterial force behind them has cea&s;ed. The veins are furni&s;hed with valves like the lymphatic ab&s;orbents; and the great trunks of the veins, and of the lacteals and lymphatic, join together before the ingre&s;s of their fluids into the left chamber of the heart; both which evince, that the blood in the veins, and the lymph and chyle in the lacteals and lymphatics, are carried on by a &s;imilar force; otherwi&s;e the &s;tream, which was propelled with a le&s;s power, could not enter the ve&s;&s;els, which contained the &s;tream propelled with a greater power. From whence it appears, that the veins are a &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els ab&s;orbing blood, as the lacteals and lymphatics are a &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els ab&s;orbing chyle and lymph. See Sect.

<P>VI. The movements of their adapted fluids in the various ve&s;&s;els of the body are carried forwards by the actions of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els in con&s;e|quence of two kinds of &s;timulus, one of which may be compared to a plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation or de&s;ire inducing the ve&s;&s;el to &s;eize, and, as it were, to &s;wallow the particles thus &s;elected from the blood; as is done by the mouths of the various glands, veins, and other ab&s;orbents, which may be called glandular appetency. The other kind of &s;timu|lus may be compared to di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, or aver&s;ion, as when the heart has received the blood, and is &s;timulated by it to pu&s;h it for|wards into the arteries; the &s;ame again &s;timulates the arteries to con|tract, and carry forwards the blood to their extremities, the glands and capillaries. Thus the me&s;enteric veins ab&s;orb the blood from the

<P>It &s;eems probable, that at the beginning of the formation of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els in the embryon, an agreeable &s;en&s;ation was in reality felt by the glands during &s;ecretion, as is now felt in the act of &s;wallowing palatable food; and that a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation was originally felt by the heart from the di&s;tention occa&s;ioned by the blood, or by its che|mical &s;timulus; but that by habit the&s;e are all become irritative mo|tions; that is, &s;uch motions as do not affect the whole &s;y&s;tem, except when the ve&s;&s;els are di&s;ea&s;ed by inflammation.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. THE &s;alival glands drink up a certain fluid from the circumflu|ent blood, and pour it into the mouth. They are &s;ometimes &s;timulated into action by the blood, that &s;urrounds their origin, or by &s;ome part of that heterogeneous fluid: for when mercurial &s;alts, or oxydes, are mixed with the blood, they &s;timulate the&s;e glands into unnatural ex|ertions; and then an unu&s;ual quantity of &s;aliva is &s;eparated.</P>
<P>As the &s;aliva &s;ecreted by the&s;e glands is mo&s;t wanted during the ma&s;tication of our food, it happens, when the terminations of their ducts in the mouth are &s;timulated into action, the &s;alival glands them|&s;elves
<PB N="267" REF="281">
are brought into increa&s;ed action at the &s;ame time by a&s;&s;ociation, and &s;eparate a greater quantity of their juices from the blood; in the &s;ame manner as tears are produced in greater abundance during the &s;timulus of the vapour of onions, or of any other acrid material in the eye.</P>
<P>The &s;aliva is thus naturally poured into the mouth only during the &s;timulus of our food in ma&s;tication; for when there is too great an ex|halation of the mucilaginous &s;ecretion from the membranes, which line the mouth, or too great an ab&s;orption of it, the mouth becomes dry, though there is no deficiency in the quantity of &s;aliva; as in tho&s;e who &s;leep with their mouths open, and in &s;ome fevers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though during the ma&s;tication of our natural food the &s;alival glands are excited into action by the &s;timulus on their excretory ducts, and a due quantity of &s;aliva is &s;eparated from the blood, and poured into the mouth; yet as this ma&s;tication of our food is always attended with a degree of plea&s;ure; and that plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is al&s;o con|nected with our ideas of certain kinds of aliment; it follows, that when the&s;e ideas are reproduced, the plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation ari&s;es along with them, and the &s;alival glands are excited into action, and fill the mouth with &s;aliva from this &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, as is frequent|ly &s;een in dogs, who &s;laver at the &s;ight of food.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have al&s;o a voluntary power over the action of the&s;e &s;alival glands, for we can at any time produce a flow of &s;aliva into our mouth, and &s;pit out, or &s;wallow it at will.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any very acrid material be held in the mouth, as the root of pyrethrum, or the leaves of tobacco, the &s;alival glands are &s;timulated into &s;tronger action than is natural, and thence &s;ecrete a much larger quantity of &s;aliva; which is at the &s;ame time more vi&s;cid than in its natural &s;tate; becau&s;e the lymphatics, that open their mouths into the ducts of the &s;alival glands, and on the membranes, which line the mouth, are likewi&s;e &s;timulated into &s;tronger action, and ab&s;orb the
<PB N="268" REF="282">
more liquid parts of the &s;aliva with greater avidity; and the remainder is left both in greater quantity and more vi&s;cid.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ed ab&s;orption in the mouth by &s;ome &s;timulating &s;ub|&s;tances, which are called a&s;tringents, as crab juice, is evident from the in&s;tant dryne&s;s produced in the mouth by a &s;mall quantity of them.</P>
<P>As the extremities of the glands are of exqui&s;ite tenuity, as appears by their difficulty of injection, it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;ecrete their fluids in a very dilute &s;tate; and, probably for the purpo&s;e of &s;timulating them into action, a quantity of neutral &s;alt is likewi&s;e &s;e|creted or formed by the gland. This aqueous and &s;aline part of all &s;ecreted fluids is again reab&s;orbed into the habit. More than half of &s;ome &s;ecreted fluids is thus imbibed from the re&s;ervoirs, into which they are poured; as in the urinary bladder much more than half of what is &s;ecreted by the kidneys becomes reab&s;orbed by the lymphatics, which are thickly di&s;per&s;ed around the neck of the bladder. This &s;eems to be the purpo&s;e of the urinary bladders of fi&s;h, as otherwi&s;e &s;uch a receptacle for the urine could have been of no u&s;e to an animal immer&s;ed in water.</P>
<P N="5">5. The idea of &s;ub&s;tances di&s;agreeably acrid will al&s;o produce a quantity of &s;aliva in the mouth; as when we &s;mell very putrid va|pours, we are induced to &s;pit out our &s;aliva, as if &s;omething di&s;agree|able was actually upon our palates.</P>
<P N="6">6. When di&s;agreeable food in the &s;tomach produces nau&s;ea, a flow of &s;aliva is excited in the mouth by a&s;&s;ociation; as efforts to vomit are frequently produced by di&s;agreeable drugs in the mouth by the &s;ame kind of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="7">7. A preternatural flow of &s;aliva is likewi&s;e &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned by a di&s;ea&s;e of the voluntary power; for if we think about our &s;aliva, and determine not to &s;wallow it, or not to &s;pit it out, an exertion is produced by the will, and more &s;aliva is &s;eoreted again&s;t our wi&s;h;
<PB N="269" REF="283">
that is, by our aver&s;ion, which bears the &s;ame analogy to de&s;ire, as pain does to plea&s;ure; as they are only modifications of the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;ition of the &s;en&s;orium. See Cla&s;s IV. 3. 2. 1.</P>
<P N="8">8. The quantity of &s;aliva may al&s;o be increa&s;ed beyond what is na|tural, by the catenation of the motions of the&s;e glands with other mo|tions, or &s;en&s;ations, as by an extraneous body in the ear; of which I have known an in&s;tance; or by the application of &s;tizolobium, &s;iliqua hir&s;uta, cowhage, to the &s;eat of the parotis, as &s;ome writers have af|firmed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">II. 1. The lacrymal gland drinks up a certain fluid from the cir|cumfluent blood, and pours it on the ball of the eye, on the upper part of the external corner of the eyelids. Though it may perhaps be &s;timulated into the performance of its natural action by the blood, which &s;urrounds its origin, or by &s;ome part of that heterogeneous fluid; yet as the tears &s;ecreted by this gland are more wanted at &s;ome times than at others, its &s;ecretion is variable, like that of the &s;aliva above mentioned, and is chiefly produced when its excretory duct is &s;timulated; for in our common &s;leep there &s;eems to be little or no &s;e|cretion of tears; though they are occa&s;ionally produced by our &s;en&s;a|tions in dreams.</P>
<P>Thus when any extraneous material on the eye-ball, or the dryne&s;s of the external covering of it, or the coldne&s;s of the air, or the acri|mony of &s;ome vapours, as of onions, &s;timulates the excretory duct of the lacrymal gland, it di&s;charges its contents upon the ball; a quicker &s;ecretion takes place in the gland, and abundant tears &s;ucceed, to moi&s;ten, clean, and lubricate the eye. The&s;e by frequent nictitation are diffu&s;ed over the whole ball, and as the external angle of the eye in winking is clo&s;ed &s;ooner than the internal angle, the tears are gra|dually driven forwards, and downwards from the lacrymal gland to the puncta lacrymalia.</P>
<P N="2">2. The lacrymal &s;ack, with its puncta lacrymalia, and its na&s;al duct, is a complete gland; and is &s;ingular in this re&s;pect, that it nei|ther
<PB N="270" REF="284">
derives its fluid from, nor di&s;gorges it into the circulation. The &s;implicity of the &s;tructure of this gland, and both the extremities of it being on the &s;urface of the body, makes it well worthy our minuter ob&s;ervation; as the actions of more intricate and concealed glands may be better under&s;tood from their analogy to this.</P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;imple gland con&s;i&s;ts of two ab&s;orbing mouths, a belly, and an excretory duct. As the tears are brought to the internal angle of the eye, the&s;e two mouths drink them up, being &s;timulated into ac|tion by this fluid, which they ab&s;orb. The belly of the gland, or lacrymal &s;ack, is thus filled, in which the &s;aline part of the tears is ab&s;orbed, and when the other end of the gland, or na&s;al duct, is &s;ti|mulated by the dryne&s;s, or pained by the coldne&s;s of the air, or af|fected by any acrimonious du&s;t or vapour in the no&s;trils, it is excited into action together with the &s;ack, and the tears are di&s;gorged upon the membrane, which lines the no&s;trils; where they &s;erve a &s;econd purpo&s;e to moi&s;ten, clean, and lubricate, the organ of &s;mell.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the na&s;al duct of this gland is &s;timulated by any very acrid material, as the powder of tobacco, or volatile &s;pirits, it not only di&s;gorges the contents of its belly or receptacle (the lacrymal &s;ack), and ab&s;orbs ha&s;tily all the fluid, that is ready for it in the cor|ner of the eye; but by the a&s;&s;ociation of its motions with tho&s;e of the lacrymal gland, it excites that al&s;o into increa&s;ed action, and a large flow of tears is poured into the eye.</P>
<P N="5">5. This na&s;al duct is likewi&s;e excited into &s;trong action by &s;en&s;itive ideas, as in grief, or joy, and then al&s;o by its a&s;&s;ociations with the la|crymal gland it produces a great flow of tears without any external &s;ti|mulus; as is more fully explained in Sect. XVI. 8. on In&s;tinct.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are &s;ome, famous in the arts of exciting compa&s;&s;ion, who are &s;aid to have acquired a voluntary power of producing a flow of tears in the eye; which, from what has been &s;aid in the &s;ection on In&s;tinct above-mentioned, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, is performed by acquiring a voluntary power over the action of this na&s;al duct.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="271" REF="285">
7. There is another circum&s;tance well worthy our attention, that when by any accident this na&s;al duct is ob&s;tructed, the lacrymal &s;ack, which is the belly or receptacle of this gland, by &s;light pre&s;&s;ure of the finger is enabled to di&s;gorge its contents again into the eye; perhaps the bile in the &s;ame manner, when the biliary ducts are ob&s;tructed, is returned into the blood by the ve&s;&s;els which &s;ecrete it?</P>
<P N="8">8. A very important though minute occurrence mu&s;t here be ob|&s;erved, that though the lacrymal gland is only excited into action, when we weep at a di&s;tre&s;sful tale, by its a&s;&s;ociation with this na&s;al duct, as is more fully explained in Sect. XVI. 8; yet the quantity of tears &s;ecreted at once is more than the puncta lacrymalia can readily ab&s;orb; which &s;hews <HI>that the motions occa&s;ioned by a&s;&s;ociations are fre|quently more energetic than the original motions, by which they were oc|ca&s;ioned.</HI> Which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention hereafter, to il|lu&s;trate, why pains frequently exi&s;t in a part di&s;tant from the cau&s;e of them, as in the other end of the urethra, when a &s;tone &s;timulates the neck of the bladder. And why inflammations frequently ari&s;e in parts di&s;tant from their cau&s;e, as the gutta ro&s;ea of drinking people, from an inflamed liver.</P>
<P>The inflammation of a part is generally preceded by a torpor or quie&s;cence of it; if this exi&s;ts in any large congeries of glands, as in the liver, or any membranous part, as the &s;tomach, pain is produced, and chilline&s;s in con&s;equence of the torpor of the ve&s;&s;els. In this &s;itu|ation &s;ometimes an inflammation of the parts &s;ucceeds the torpor; at other times a di&s;tant more &s;en&s;ible part becomes inflamed; who&s;e ac|tions have previou&s;ly been a&s;&s;ociated with it; and the torpor of the fir&s;t part cea&s;es. This I apprehend happens, when the gout of the foot &s;ucceeds a pain of the biliary duct, or of the &s;tomach. La&s;tly, it &s;ome|times happens, that the pain of torpor exi&s;ts without any con&s;equent inflammation of the affected part, or of any di&s;tant part a&s;&s;ociated with it, as in the membranes about the temple and eye-brows in hemicra|nia, and in tho&s;e pains, which occa&s;ion convul&s;ions; if this happens
<PB N="272" REF="286">
to gouty people, when it affects the liver, I &s;uppo&s;e epileptic fits are produced; and, when it affects the &s;tomach, death is the con&s;equence. In the&s;e ca&s;es the pul&s;e is weak, and the extremities cold, and &s;uch medicines as &s;timulate the quie&s;cent parts into action, or which induce inflammation in them, or in any di&s;tant part, which is a&s;&s;ociated with them, cures the pre&s;ent pain of torpor, and &s;aves the patient.</P>
<P>I have twice &s;een a gouty inflammation of the liver, attended with jaundice; the patients after a few days were both of them affected with cold fits, like ague-fits, and their feet became affected with gout, and the inflammation of their livers cea&s;ed. It is probable, that the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations about the &s;tomach, and indige&s;tion, which precedes gouty paroxy&s;ms, are generally owing to torpor or &s;light inflammation of the liver, and biliary ducts; but where great pain with continued &s;ickne&s;s, with feeble pul&s;e, and &s;en&s;ation of cold, affect the &s;tomach in patients debilitated by the gout, that it is a torpor of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, and de&s;troys the patient from the great connexion of that vi&s;cus with the vital organs.

<P N="1">1. THE throat, &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, may be con&s;idered as one great gland; which, like the lacrymal &s;ack above mentioned, nei|ther begins nor ends in the circulation. Though the act of ma&s;ticat|ing our aliment belongs to the &s;en&s;itive cla&s;s of motions, for the plea|&s;ure of its ta&s;te induces the mu&s;cles of the jaw into action; yet the deglutition of it when ma&s;ticated is generally, if not always, an irrita|tive motion, occa&s;ioned by the application of the food already ma&s;ti|cated to the origin of the pharix; in the &s;ame manner as we often &s;wallow our &s;pittle without attending to it.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="288">
The ruminating cla&s;s of animals have the power to invert the mo|tion of their gullet, and of their fir&s;t &s;tomach, from the &s;timulus of this aliment, when it is a little further prepared; as is their daily practice in chewing the cud; and appears to the eye of any one, who attends to them, whil&s;t they are employed in this &s;econd ma&s;tication of their food.</P>
<P N="2">2. When our natural aliment arrives into the &s;tomach, this organ is &s;timulated into its proper vermicular action; which beginning at the upper orifice of it, and terminating at the lower one, gradually mixes together and pu&s;hes forwards the dige&s;ting materials into the inte&s;tine beneath it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the glands, that &s;upply the ga&s;tric juices, which are nece&s;&s;ary to promote the chemical part of the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, are &s;timulated to di&s;charge their contained fluids, and to &s;eparate a further &s;upply from the blood-ve&s;&s;els: and the lacteals or lymphatics, which open their mouths into the &s;tomach, are &s;timulated into action, and take up &s;ome part of the dige&s;ting materials.</P>
<P N="3">3. The remainder of the&s;e dige&s;ting materials is carried forwards into the upper inte&s;tines, and &s;timulates them into their peri&s;taltic motion &s;imilar to that of the &s;tomach; which continues gradually to mix the changing materials, and pa&s;s them along through the valve of the colon to the excretory end of this great gland, the &s;phincter ani.</P>
<P>The dige&s;ting materials produce a flow of bile, and of pancreatic juice, as they pa&s;s along the duodenum, by &s;timulating the excretory ducts of the liver and pancreas, which terminate in that inte&s;tine: and other branches of the ab&s;orbent or lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, called lacteals, are excited to drink up, as it pa&s;&s;es, tho&s;e parts of the dige&s;ting me|terials, that are proper for their purpo&s;e, by its &s;timulus on their mouths.</P>

liver, and lacteal ve&s;&s;els, are excited into action; but at the &s;ame time the whole tribe of irritative motions are exerted with greater energy, a greater degree of warmth, colour, plumpne&s;s, and moi&s;ture, is given to the &s;kin from the increa&s;ed action of tho&s;e glands called capillary ve&s;&s;els; plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is excited, the voluntary motions are le&s;s ea&s;ily exerted, and at length &s;u&s;pended; and &s;leep &s;ucceeds, un|le&s;s it be prevented by the &s;timulus of &s;urrounding objects, or by vo|luntary exertion, or by an acquired habit, which was originally pro|duced by one or other of the&s;e circum&s;tances, as is explained in Sect. XXI. on Drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>At this time al&s;o, as the blood-ve&s;&s;els become replete with chyle, more urine is &s;eparated into the bladder, and le&s;s of it is reab&s;orbed; more mucus poured into the cellular membranes, and le&s;s of it re|ab&s;orbed; the pul&s;e becomes fuller, and &s;ofter, and in general quicker. The rea&s;on why le&s;s urine and cellular mucus is ab&s;orbed after a full meal with &s;ufficient drink is owing to the blood-ve&s;&s;els being fuller: hence one means to promote ab&s;orption is to decrea&s;e the re&s;i&s;tance by emptying the ve&s;&s;els by vene&s;ection. From this decrea&s;ed ab&s;orption the urine becomes pale as well as copious, and the &s;kin appears plump as well as florid.</P>
<P>By daily repetition of the&s;e movements they all become connected together, and make a diurnal circle of irritative action, and if one of this chain be di&s;turbed, the whole is liable to be put into di&s;order. See Sect. XX. on Vertigo.</P>
<P N="5">5. When the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines receive a quantity of food, who&s;e &s;timulus is greater than u&s;ual, all their motions, and tho&s;e of the glands and lymphatics, are &s;timulated into &s;tronger action than u&s;ual, and perform their offices with greater vigour and in le&s;s time: &s;uch are the effects of certain quantities of &s;pice or of vinous &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="6">6. But if the quantity or duration of the&s;e &s;timuli are &s;till further increa&s;ed, the &s;tomach and throat are &s;timulated into a motion, who&s;e direction is contrary to the natural one above de&s;cribed; and they re|gurgitate
<PB N="276" REF="290">
the materials, which they contain, in&s;tead of carrying them forwards. This retrograde motion of the &s;tomach may be compared to the &s;tretchings of wearied limbs the contrary way, and is well elu|cidated by the following experiment. Look earne&s;tly for a minute or two on an area an inch &s;quare of pink &s;ilk, placed in a &s;trong light, the eye becomes fatigued, the colour becomes faint, and at length vani&s;hes, for the fatigued eye can no longer be &s;timulated into direct motions; then on clo&s;ing the eye a green &s;pectrum will appear in it, which is a colour directly contrary to pink, and which will appear and di&s;appear repeatedly, like the efforts in vomiting. See Section XXIX. 11.</P>
<P>Hence all tho&s;e drugs, which by their bitter or a&s;tringent &s;timulus increa&s;e the action of the &s;tomach, as camomile and white vitriol, if their quantity is increa&s;ed above a certain do&s;e become emetics.</P>
<P>The&s;e inverted motions of the &s;tomach and throat are generally produced from the &s;timulus of unnatural food, and are attended with the &s;en&s;ation of nau&s;ea or &s;ickne&s;s: but as this &s;en&s;ation is again con|nected with an idea of the di&s;ta&s;teful food, which induced it; &s;o an idea of nau&s;eous food will al&s;o &s;ometimes excite the action of nau&s;ea; and that give ri&s;e by a&s;&s;ociation to the inver&s;ion of the motions of the &s;tomach and throat. As &s;ome, who have had hor&s;e-fle&s;h or dogs|fle&s;h given them for beef or mutton, are &s;aid to have vomited many hours afterwards, when they have been told of the impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I have been told of a per&s;on, who had gained a voluntary command over the&s;e inverted motions of the &s;tomach and throat, and &s;upported him&s;elf by exhibiting this curio&s;ity to the public. At the&s;e exhibitions he &s;wallowed a pint of red rough goo&s;eberries, and a pint of white &s;mooth ones, brought them up in &s;mall parcels into his mouth, and re&s;tored them &s;eparately to the &s;pectators, who called for red or white as they plea&s;ed, till the whole were redelivered.</P>
<P N="7">7. At the &s;ame time that the&s;e motions of the &s;tomach and throat are &s;timulated into inver&s;ion, &s;ome of the other irritative motions,
<PB N="277" REF="291">
that had acquired more immediate connexions with the &s;tomach, as tho&s;e of the ga&s;tric glands, are excited into &s;tronger action by this a&s;&s;ociation; and &s;ome other of the&s;e motions, which are more ea&s;ily excited, as tho&s;e of the ga&s;tric lymphatics, are inverted by their a&s;&s;o|ciation with the retrograde motions of the &s;tomach, and regurgitate their contents, and thus a greater quantity of mucus, and of lymph, or chyle, is poured into the &s;tomach, and thrown up along with its contents.</P>
<P N="8">8. The&s;e inver&s;ions of the motion of the &s;tomach in vomiting are performed by intervals, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that many other motions are reciprocally exerted and relaxed; for during the time of exertion the &s;timulus, or &s;en&s;ation, which cau&s;ed this exertion, is not per|ceived; but begins to be perceived again, as &s;oon as the exertion cea&s;es, and is &s;ome time in again producing its effect. As explained in Sect. XXXIV. on Volition, where it is &s;hewn, that the contrac|tions of the fibres, and the &s;en&s;ation of pain, which occa&s;ioned that exertion, cannot exi&s;t at the &s;ame time. The exertion cea&s;es from another cau&s;e al&s;o, which is the exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of the part, and the&s;e two cau&s;es frequently operate together.</P>
<P N="9">9. At the times of the&s;e inverted efforts of the &s;tomach not only the lymphatics, which open their mouths into the &s;tomach, but tho&s;e of the &s;kin al&s;o, are for a time inverted; for &s;weats are &s;ometimes pu&s;hed out during the efforts of vomiting without an increa&s;e of heat.</P>
<P N="10">10. But if by a greater &s;timulus the motions of the &s;tomach are in|verted &s;till more violently or more permanently, the duodenum has its peri&s;taltic motions inverted at the &s;ame time by their a&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; and the bile and pancreatic juice, which it contains, are by the inverted motions brought up into the &s;tomach, and di&s;charged along with its contents; while a greater quantity of bile and pancreatic juice is poured into this inte&s;tine; as the
<PB N="278" REF="292">
glands, that &s;ecrete them, are by their a&s;&s;ociation with the motions of the inte&s;tine excited into &s;tronger action than u&s;ual.</P>
<P N="11">11. The other inte&s;tines are by a&s;&s;ociation excited into more power|ful action, while the lymphatics, that open their mouths into them, &s;uffer an inver&s;ion of their motions corre&s;ponding with the lymphatics of the &s;tomach, and duodenum; which with a part of the abundant &s;ecretion of bile is carried downwards, and contributes both to &s;timu|late the bowels, and to increa&s;e the quantity of the evacuations. This inver&s;ion of the motion of the lymphatics appears from the quantity of chyle, which comes away by &s;tools; which is otherwi&s;e ab&s;orbed as &s;oon as produced, and by the immen&s;e quantity of thin fluid, which is evacuated along with it.</P>
<P N="12">12. But if the &s;timulus, which inverts the &s;tomach, be &s;till more powerful, or more permanent, it &s;ometimes happens, that the motions of the biliary glands, and of their excretory ducts, are at the &s;ame time inverted, and regurgitate their contained bile into the blood-ve&s;|&s;els, as appears by the yellow colour of the &s;kin, and of the urine; and it is probable the pancreatic &s;ecretion may &s;uffer an inver&s;ion at the &s;ame time, though we have yet no mark by which this can be a&s;certained.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> eat two putrid pigeons out of a cold pigeon-pye, and drank about a pint of beer and ale along with them, and immedi|ately rode about five miles. He was then &s;eized with vomiting, which was after a few periods &s;ucceeded by purging; the&s;e con|tinued alternately for two hours; and the purging continued by intervals for &s;ix or eight hours longer. During this time he could not force him&s;elf to drink more than one pint in the whole, this great inability to drink was owing to the nau&s;ea, or inverted motions of the &s;tomach, which the voluntary exertion of &s;wallowing could &s;eldom and with difficulty overcome; yet he di&s;charged in the whole at lea&s;t &s;ix quarts; whence came this
<PB N="279" REF="293">
quantity of liquid? Fir&s;t, the contents of the &s;tomach were emitted, then of the duodenum, gall-bladder, and pancreas, by vomiting. After this the contents of the lower bowels, then the chyle, that was in the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, and in the receptacle of chyle, was regurgitated into the inte&s;tines by a retrograde motion of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. And after|wards the mucus depo&s;ited in the cellular membrane, and on the &s;ur|face of all the other membranes, &s;eems to have been ab&s;orbed; and with the fluid ab&s;orbed from the air to have been carried up their re|&s;pective lymphatic branches by the increa&s;ed energy of their natural motions, and down the vi&s;ceral lymphatics, or lacteals, by the inver|&s;ion of their motions.</P>
<P N="14">14. It may be difficult to invent experiments to demon&s;trate the truth of this inver&s;ion of &s;ome branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of others, but the analogy of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to the inte&s;tinal canal, and the &s;ymptoms of many di&s;ea&s;es, render this opi|nion more probable than many other received opinions of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>In the above in&s;tance, after the yellow excrement was voided, the fluid cea&s;ed to have any &s;mell, and appeared like curdled milk, and then a thinner fluid, and &s;ome mucus, were evacuated: did not the&s;e &s;eem to partake of the chyle, of the mucus fluid from all the cells of the body, and la&s;tly, of the atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture? All the&s;e facts may be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved by any one, who takes a bri&s;k purge.</P>
<P N="15">15. Where the &s;timulus on the &s;tomach, or on &s;ome other part of the inte&s;tinal canal, is &s;till more permanent, not only the lacteal ve&s;|&s;els, but the whole canal it&s;elf, becomes inverted from its a&s;&s;ocia|tions: this is the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, in which all the fluids mentioned above are thrown up by the mouth. At this time the valve in the colon, from the inverted motions of that bowel, and the inverted ac|tion of this living valve, does not prevent the regurgitation of its contents.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="294">
The &s;tructure of this valve may be repre&s;ented by a flexile leathern pipe &s;tanding up from the bottom of a ve&s;&s;el of water: its &s;ides col|lap&s;e by the pre&s;&s;ure of the ambient fluid, as a &s;mall part of that fluid pa&s;&s;es through it; but if it has a living power, and by its inverted ac|tion keeps it&s;elf open, it becomes like a rigid pipe, and will admit the whole liquid to pa&s;s. See Sect. XXIX. 2. 5.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the patient is aver&s;e to drink, from the con&s;tant inver|&s;ion of the motions of the &s;tomach, and yet many quarts are daily ejected from the &s;tomach, which at length &s;mell of excrement, and at la&s;t &s;eem to be only a thin mucilaginous or aqueous liquor.</P>
<P>From whence is it po&s;&s;ible, that this great quantity of fluid for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days can be &s;upplied, after the cells of the body have given up their fluids, but from the atmo&s;phere? When the cutaneous branch of ab&s;orbents acts with unnatural &s;trength, it is probable the inte&s;tinal branch has its motions inverted, and thus a fluid is &s;upplied without entering the arterial &s;y&s;tem. Could oiling or painting the &s;kin give a check to this di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>So when the &s;tomach has its motions inverted, the lymphatics of the &s;tomach, which are mo&s;t &s;trictly a&s;&s;ociated with it, invert their motions at the &s;ame time. But the more di&s;tant branches of lympha|tics, which are le&s;s &s;trictly a&s;&s;ociated with it, act with increa&s;ed ener|gy; as the cutaneous lymphatics in the cholera, or iliac pa&s;&s;ion, above de&s;cribed. And other irritative motions become decrea&s;ed, as the pul&s;ations of the arteries, from the extra-derivation or exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P>Sometimes when &s;tronger vomiting takes place the more di&s;tant branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem invert their motions with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, and loo&s;e &s;tools are produced, and cold &s;weats.</P>
<P>So when the lacteals have their motions inverted, as during the operation of &s;trong purges, the urinary and cutaneous ab&s;orbents have their motions increa&s;ed to &s;upply the want of fluid in the blood, as in great thir&s;t; but after a meal with &s;ufficient potation the urine is pale,
<PB N="281" REF="295">
that is, the urinary ab&s;orbents act weakly, no &s;upply of water being wanted for the blood. And when the inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents act too violently, as when too great quantities of fluid have been drank, the urinary ab&s;orbents invert their motions to carry off the &s;uperfluity, which is a new circum&s;tance of a&s;&s;ociation, and a temporary diabetes &s;upervenes.</P>
<P N="16">16. I have had the opportunity of &s;eeing four patients in the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, where the ejected material &s;melled and looked like excrement. Two of the&s;e were &s;o exhau&s;ted at the time I &s;aw them, that more blood could not be taken from them, and as their pain had cea&s;ed, and they continued to vomit up every thing which they drank, I &s;u&s;pected that a mortification of the bowel had already taken place, and as they were both women advanced in life, and a mortification is produced with le&s;s preceding pain in old and weak people, the&s;e both died. The other two, who were both young men, had &s;till pain and &s;trength &s;ufficient for further vene&s;ection, and they neither of them had any appearance of hernia, both recovered by repeated bleeding, and a &s;cruple of calomel given to one, and half a dram to the other, in very &s;mall pills: the u&s;ual means of cly&s;ters, and purges joined with opiates, had been in vain attempted. I have thought an ounce or two of crude mercury in le&s;s violent di&s;ea&s;es of this kind has been of u&s;e, by contributing to re&s;tore its natural motion to &s;ome part of the inte&s;tinal canal, either by its weight or &s;timulus; and that hence the whole tube recovered its u&s;ual a&s;&s;ociations of progre&s;&s;ive peri&s;taltic motion. I have in three ca&s;es &s;een crude mercury given in &s;mall do&s;es, as one or two ounces twice a day, have great effect in &s;topping pertinaceous vomitings.</P>
<P N="17">17. Be&s;ides the affections above de&s;cribed, the &s;tomach is liable, like many other membranes of the body, to torpor without con&s;equent inflammation: as happens to the membranes about the head in &s;ome ca&s;es of hemicrania, or in general head-ach. This torpor of the &s;to|mach
<PB N="282" REF="296">
is attended with indige&s;tion, and con&s;equent flatulency, and with pain, which is u&s;ually called the cramp of the &s;tomach, and is relievable by aromatics, e&s;&s;ential oils, alcohol, or opium.</P>
<P>The intru&s;ion of a gall-&s;tone into the common bile-duct from the gall-bladder is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for a pain of the &s;tomach, as neither of them are attended with fever; but in the pa&s;&s;age of a gall-&s;tone, the pain is confined to a le&s;s &s;pace, which is exactly where the common bile-duct enters the duodenum, as explained in Section XXX. 3. Whereas in this ga&s;trodynia the pain is diffu&s;ed over the whole &s;tomach; and, like other di&s;ea&s;es from torpor, the pul&s;e is weaker, and the extremities colder, and the ge|neral debility greater, than in the pa&s;&s;age of a gall-&s;tone; for in the former the debility is the con&s;equence of the pain, in the latter it is the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t fits of the gout, I believe, commence with a torpor of the liver; and the ball of the toe becomes inflamed in&s;tead of the membranes of the liver in con&s;equence of this torpor, as a coryza or catarrh frequently &s;ucceeds a long expo&s;ure of the feet to cold, as in &s;now, or on a moi&s;t brick-floor; yet in old or exhau&s;ted con&s;titutions, which have been long habituated to its attacks, it &s;ome|times commences with a torpor of the &s;tomach, and is transferable to every membrane of the body. When the gout begins with torpor of the &s;tomach, a painful &s;en&s;ation of cold occurs, which the patient compares to ice, with weak pul&s;e, cold extremities, and &s;ickne&s;s; this in its &s;lighter degree is relievable by &s;pice, wine, or opium; in its greater degree it is &s;ucceeded by &s;udden death, which is owing to the &s;ympathy of the &s;tomach with the heart, as explained below.</P>
<P>If the &s;tomach; becomes inflamed in con&s;equence of this gouty torpor of it, or in con&s;equence of its &s;ympathy with &s;ome other part, the danger is le&s;s. A &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting continues many
<PB N="283" REF="297">
days, or even weeks, the &s;tomach rejecting every thing &s;timulant, even opium or alcohol, together with much vi&s;cid mucus; till the inflammation at length cea&s;es, as happens when other membranes, as tho&s;e of the joints, are the &s;eat of gouty inflammation; as ob&s;erved in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.</P>
<P>The &s;ympathy, or a&s;&s;ociation of motions, between tho&s;e of the &s;tomach and tho&s;e of the heart, are evinced in many di&s;ea&s;es. Fir&s;t, many people are occa&s;ionally affected with an intermi&s;&s;ion of their pul&s;e for a few days, which then cea&s;es again. In this ca&s;e there is a &s;top of the motion of the heart, and at the &s;ame time a tendency to eructation from the &s;tomach. As &s;oon as the patient feels a tendency to the intermi&s;&s;ion of the motion of his heart, if he voluntarily brings up wind from his &s;tomach, the &s;top of the heart does not occur. From hence I conclude that the &s;top of dige&s;tion is the primary di&s;ea&s;e; and that air is in&s;tantly generated from the aliment, which begins to ferment, if the dige&s;tive pro|ce&s;s is impeded for a moment, (&s;ee Sect. XXIII. 4.); and that the &s;top of the heart is in con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;ociation of the motions of the&s;e vi&s;cera, as explained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 4.; but if the little air, which is in&s;tantly generated during the temporary torpor of the &s;tomach, be evacuated, the dige&s;tion recommences, and the tempo|rary torpor of the heart does not follow. One patient, whom I lately &s;aw, and who had been five or &s;ix days much troubled with this in|termi&s;&s;ion of a pul&s;ation of his heart, and who had hemicrania with &s;ome fever, was immediately relieved from them all by lo&s;ing ten ounces of blood, which had what is termed an inflammatory cru&s;t on it.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this a&s;&s;ociation between the motions of the &s;tomach and heart is evinced by the exhibition of an over do&s;e of foxglove, which induces an ince&s;&s;ant vomiting, which is attended with very &s;low, and &s;ometimes intermitting pul&s;e.&mdash;Which continues
<PB N="284" REF="298">
in &s;pite of the exhibition of wine and opium for two or three days. To the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation mu&s;t be a&s;cribed the weak pul&s;e, which con|&s;tantly attends the exhibition of emetics during their operation. And al&s;o the &s;udden deaths, which have been occa&s;ioned in boxing by a blow on the &s;tomach; and la&s;tly, the &s;udden death of tho&s;e, who have been long debilitated by the gout, from the torpor of the &s;tomach.

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. THE capillary ve&s;&s;els are like all the other glands except the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, ina&s;much as they receive blood from the ar|teries, &s;eparate a fluid from it, and return the remainder by the veins.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;eries of glands is of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;e, as their ex|cretory ducts open on the whole external &s;kin forming its per&s;pirative pores, and on the internal &s;urfaces of every cavity of the body. Their &s;ecretion on the &s;kin is termed in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, which in health is in part reab&s;orbed by the mouths of the lymphatics, and in part evaporated in the air; the &s;ecretion on the membranes, which line the larger cavities of the body, which have external openings, as the mouth and inte&s;tinal canal, is termed mucus, but is not however co|agulable by heat; and the &s;ecretion on the membranes of tho&s;e cavi|ties of the body, which have no external openings, is called lymph or
<PB N="286" REF="300">
water, as in the cavities of the cellular membrane, and of the abdo|men; this lymph however is coagulable by the heat of boiling wa|ter. Some mucus nearly as vi&s;cid as the white of egg, which was di&s;charged by &s;tool, did not coagulate, though I evaporated it to one fourth of the quantity, nor did the aqueous and vitreous humours of a &s;heep's eye coagulate by the like experiment: but the &s;ero&s;ity from an ana&s;arcous leg, and that from the abdomen of a drop&s;ical per&s;on, and the cry&s;talline humour of a &s;heep's eye, coagulated in the &s;ame heat.</P>
<P N="3">3. When any of the&s;e capillary glands are &s;timulated into greater irritative actions, than is natural, they &s;ecrete a more copious mate|rial; and as the mouths of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, which open in their vicinity, are at the &s;ame time &s;timulated into greater action, the thinner and more &s;aline part of the &s;ecreted fluid is taken up again; and the remainder is not only more copious but al&s;o more vi&s;cid than natural. This is more or le&s;s trouble&s;ome or noxious according to the importance of the functions of the part affected: on the &s;kin and bronchiae, where this &s;ecretion ought naturally to evaporate, it be|comes &s;o vi&s;cid as to adhere to the membrane; on the tongue it forms a pellicle, which can with difficulty be &s;craped off; produces the &s;curf on the heads of many people; and the mucus, which is &s;pit up by others in coughing. On the no&s;trils and fauces, when the &s;ecretion of the&s;e capillary glands is increa&s;ed, it is termed &s;imple catarrh; when in the inte&s;tines, a mucous diarrhoea; and in the urethra, or vagina, it has the name of gonorrhoea, or fluor albus.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the&s;e capillary glands become inflamed, a &s;till more vi&s;cid or even cretaceous humour is produced upon the &s;urfaces of the mem|branes, which is the cau&s;e or the effect of rheumati&s;m, gout, lepro&s;y, and of hard tumours of the legs, which are generally termed &s;corbutic; all which will be treated of hereafter.</P>

<P>For however &s;mall we may conceive the diameters of the minute&s;t ve&s;&s;els of the body, which e&s;cape our eyes and gla&s;&s;es, yet the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of coats or &s;ides, which are made up of an unorga|nized material, and which are probably produced from a gluten, which hardens after its production, like the &s;ilk or web of caterpillars and &s;piders. Of this material con&s;i&s;t the membranes, which line the &s;hells of eggs, and the &s;hell it&s;elf, both which are unorganized, and are formed from mucus, which hardens after it is formed, either by the ab&s;orption of its more fluid part, or by its uniting with &s;ome part of the atmo&s;phere. Such is al&s;o the production of the &s;hells of &s;nails, and of &s;hell-fi&s;h, and I &s;uppo&s;e of the enamel of the teeth.</P>
<P N="2">2. But though the membranes, that compo&s;e the &s;ides of the mo&s;t minute ve&s;&s;els, are in truth unorganized materials, yet the larger membranes, which are perceptible to the eye, &s;eem to be com|po&s;ed of an intertexture of the mouths of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and of the excretory ducts of the capillaries, with their concomitant arteries, veins, and nerves: and from this con&s;truction it is evident, that the&s;e membranes mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s great irritability to peculiar &s;ti|muli, though they are incapable of any motions, that are vi&s;ible to the naked eye: and daily experience &s;hews us, that in their inflamed &s;tate they have the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ibility to pain, as in the pleuri&s;y and paronychia.</P>
<P N="3">3. On all the&s;e membranes a mucilaginous or aqueous fluid is &s;ecreted, which moi&s;tens and lubricates their &s;urfaces, as was ex|plained
<PB N="288" REF="302">
in Section XXIII. 2. Some have doubted, whether this mucus is &s;eparated from the blood by an appropriated &s;et of glands, or exudes through the membranes, or is an abra&s;ion or de&s;truc|tion of the &s;urface of the membrane it&s;elf, which is continually repaired on the other &s;ide of it, but the great analogy between the capillary ve&s;&s;els, and the other glands, countenances the former opinion; and evinces, that the&s;e capillaries are the glands, that &s;ecrete it; to which we mu&s;t add, that the blood in pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e capillary ve&s;&s;els undergoes a change in its colour from florid to purple, and gives out a quantity of heat; from whence, as in other glands, we mu&s;t conclude that &s;omething is &s;ecreted from it.</P>

<P>III. The &s;eat of rheumati&s;m is in the membranes, or upon them; but there are three very di&s;tinct di&s;ea&s;es, which commonly are confounded under this name. Fir&s;t, when a membrane becomes affected with torpor, or inactivity of the ve&s;&s;els which compo&s;e it, pain and coldne&s;s &s;ucceed, as in the hemicrania, and other head|achs, which are generally termed nervous rheumati&s;m; they exi&s;t whether the part be at re&s;t or in motion, and are generally attended with other marks of debility.</P>
<P>Another rheumati&s;m is &s;aid to exi&s;t, when inflammation and &s;welling, as well as pain, affect &s;ome of the membranes of the joints, as of the ancles, wri&s;ts, knees, elbows, and &s;ometimes of the ribs. This is accompanied with fever, is analogous to pleu|ri&s;y, and other inflammations, and is termed the acute rheuma|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>A third di&s;ea&s;e is called chronic rheumati&s;m, which is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that fir&s;t mentioned, as in this the pain only affects the patient during the motion of the part, and from the &s;econd kind of rheumati&s;m above de&s;cribed, as it is not attended with quick pul&s;e or inflammation. It is generally believed to &s;ucceed the acute rheu|mati&s;m
<PB N="289" REF="303">
of the &s;ame part, and that &s;ome coagulable lymph, or creta|ceous, or calculous material, has been left on the membrane; which gives pain, when the mu&s;cles move over it, as &s;ome extraneous body would do, which was too in&s;oluble to be ab&s;orbed. Hence there is an analogy between this chronic rheumati&s;m and the di&s;ea&s;es which produce gravel or gout-&s;tones; and it may perhaps receive relief from the &s;ame remedies, &s;uch as aerated &s;al &s;oda.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. AS the imbibing mouths of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem already de|&s;cribed open on the &s;urface, and into the larger cavities of the body, &s;o there is another &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which are not com|monly e&s;teemed &s;uch, I mean the veins, which take up the blood from the various glands and capillaries, after their proper fluids or &s;e|cretions have been &s;eparated from it.</P>
<P>The veins re&s;emble the other ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; as the progre&s;&s;ion of their contents is carried on in the &s;ame manner in both, they alike ab&s;orb their appropriated fluids, and have valves to prevent its regur|gitation by the accidents of mechanical violence. This appears fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is no pul&s;ation in the very beginnings of the veins, as is &s;een by micro&s;copes; which mu&s;t happen, if the blood was carried into them by the action of the arteries. For though the concurrence of various venous &s;treams of blood from different di&s;tances mu&s;t pre|vent any pul&s;ation in the larger branches, yet in the very beginnings of all the&s;e branches a pul&s;ation mu&s;t unavoidably exi&s;t, if the circu|lation
<PB N="291" REF="305">
in them was owing to the intermitted force of the arteries. Secondly, the venous ab&s;orption of blood from the penis, and from the teats of female animals after their erection, is &s;till more &s;imilar to the lymphatic ab&s;orption, as it is previou&s;ly poured into cells, where all arterial impul&s;e mu&s;t cea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is an experiment, which &s;eems to evince this venous ab&s;orp|tion, which con&s;i&s;ts in the external application of a &s;timulus to the lips, as of vinegar, by which they become in&s;tantly pale; that is, the bibulous mouths of the veins by this &s;timulus are excited to ab&s;orb the blood fa&s;ter, than it can be &s;upplied by the u&s;ual arterial exertion. See Sect. XXIII. 5.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of haemorrhages frequent in di&s;ea&s;es, one is where the glandular or capillary action is too powerfully exerted, and propels the blood forwards more ha&s;tily, than the veins can ab&s;orb it; and the other is, where the ab&s;orbent power of the veins is dimini&s;hed, or a branch of them is become totally paralytic.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e ca&s;es is known by the heat of the part, and the general fever or inflammation that accompanies the haemorrhage. An haemorrhage from the no&s;e or from the lungs is &s;ometimes a cri&s;is of inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, as of the hepatitis and gout, and generally cea&s;es &s;pontaneou&s;ly, when the ve&s;&s;els are con&s;iderably emptied. Sometimes the haemorrhage recurs by daily periods accompanying the hot fits of fever, and cea&s;ing in the cold fits, or in the intermi&s;&s;ions; this is to be cured by removing the febrile paroxy&s;ms, which will be treated of in their place. Otherwi&s;e it is cured by vene&s;ection, by the internal or external preparations of lead, or by the application of cold, with an ab&s;temious diet, and diluting liquids, like other inflam|mations. Which by inducing a quie&s;cence on tho&s;e glandular parts, that are affected, prevents a greater quantity of blood from being pro|truded forwards, than the veins are capable of ab&s;orbing.</P>
<P>Mr. B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had an haemorrhage from his kidney, and parted with not le&s;s than a pint of blood a day (by conjecture) along with his

He was then directed to bathe in a cold &s;pring up to the middle of his body only, the upper part being covered, and the haemorrhage dimini&s;hed at the fir&s;t, and cea&s;ed at the &s;econd im|mer&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the external capillaries were rendered quie&s;cent by the coldne&s;s of the water, and thence a le&s;s quantity of blood was cir|culated through them; and the internal capillaries, or other glands, became quie&s;cent from their irritative a&s;&s;ociations with the external ones; and the haemorrhage was &s;topped a &s;ufficient time for the rup|tured ve&s;&s;els to contract their apertures, or for the blood in tho&s;e aper|tures to coagulate.</P>
<P>Mrs. K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had a continued haemorrhage from her no&s;e for &s;ome days; the ruptured ve&s;&s;el was not to be reached by plugs up the no&s;trils, and the &s;en&s;ibility of her fauces was &s;uch that nothing could be borne behind the uvula. After repeated vene&s;ection, and other common applications, &s;he was directed to immer&s;e her whole head into a pail of water, which was made colder by the addi|tion of &s;everal handfuls of &s;alt, and the haemorrhage immediately cea&s;ed, and returned no more; but her pul&s;e continued hard, and &s;he was nece&s;&s;itated to lo&s;e blood from the arm on the &s;ucceed|ing day.</P>
<P>Query, might not the cold bath in&s;tantly &s;top haemorrhages from the lungs in inflammatory ca&s;es?&mdash;for the &s;hortne&s;s of breath of tho&s;e, who go &s;uddenly into cold water, is not owing to the accumulation of blood in the lungs, but to the quie&s;cence of the pulmonary capillaries from a&s;&s;ociation, as explained in Section XXXII. 3. 2.</P>

<P>II. The other kind of haemorrhage is known from its being at|tended with a weak pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of general debility,
<PB N="293" REF="307">
and very frequently occurs in tho&s;e, who have di&s;ea&s;ed livers, owing to intemperance in the u&s;e of fermented liquors. The&s;e con&s;titutions are &s;hewn to be liable to paraly&s;is of the lymphatic ab&s;orbents, pro|ducing the various kinds of drop&s;ies in Section XXIX. 5. Now if any branch of the venous &s;y&s;tem lo&s;es its power of ab&s;orption, the part &s;wells, and at length bur&s;ts and di&s;charges the blood, which the ca|pillaries or other glands circulate through them.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that the large external veins of the legs bur&s;t, and effu&s;e their blood; but this occurs mo&s;t frequently in the veins of the inte&s;tines, as the vena portarum is liable to &s;uffer from a &s;chirrus of the liver oppo&s;ing the progre&s;&s;ion of the blood, which is ab&s;orbed from the inte&s;tines. Hence the piles are a &s;ymptom of he|patic ob&s;truction, and hence the copious di&s;charges downwards or upwards of a black material, which has been called melancholia, or black bile; but is no other than the blood, which is probably di&s;charged from the veins of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>J. F. Meckel, in his Experimenta de Finibus Va&s;orum, publi&s;hed at Berlin, 1772, mentions his di&s;covery of a communication of a lymphatic ve&s;&s;el with the ga&s;tric branch of the vena portarum. It is po&s;&s;ible, that when the motion of the lymphatic becomes retro|grade in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, that blood may obtain a pa&s;&s;age into it, where it ana&s;tomo&s;es with the vein, and thus be poured into the inte&s;tines. A di&s;charge of blood with the urine &s;ometimes attends diabetes, and may have its &s;ource in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>But any other part of the venous &s;y&s;tem may become quie&s;cent or totally paralytic as well as the veins of the inte&s;tines: all which

occur more frequently in tho&s;e who have di&s;ea&s;ed livers, than in any others. Hence trouble&s;ome bleedings of the no&s;e, or from the lungs with a weak pul&s;e; hence haemorrhages from the kidneys, too great men&s;truation; and hence the oozing of blood from every part of the body, and the petechiae in tho&s;e fevers, which are termed putrid, and which is erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed to the thinne&s;s of the blood: for the blood in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es is equally fluid before it coagulates in the cold air.</P>
<P>Is not that hereditary con&s;umption, which occurs chiefly in dark|eyed people about the age of twenty, and commences with &s;light pul|monary haemorrhages without fever, a di&s;ea&s;e of this kind?&mdash;The&s;e haemorrhages frequently begin during &s;leep, when the irritability of the lungs is not &s;ufficient in the&s;e patients to carry on the circula|tion without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of volition; for in our waking hours, the motions of the lungs are in part voluntary, e&s;pecially if any difficulty of breathing renders the efforts of volition nece&s;&s;ary. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 2. and Cla&s;s III. 2. 1. 10. Another &s;pecies of pulmo|nary con&s;umption which &s;eems more certainly of &s;crophulous origin is de&s;cribed in the next Section, No. 2.</P>
<P>I have &s;een two ca&s;es of women, of about forty years of age, both of whom were &s;eized with quick weak pul&s;e, with difficult re&s;piration, and who &s;pit up by coughing much vi&s;cid mucus mixed with dark coloured blood. They had both large vibices on their limbs, and petechiae; in one the feet were in danger of mortifica|tion, in the other the legs were oedematous. To relieve the diffi|cult re&s;piration, about &s;ix ounces of blood were taken from one of them, which to my &s;urpri&s;e was &s;izy, like inflamed blood: they had both palpitations or unequal pul&s;ations of the heart. They con|tinued four or five weeks with pale and bloated countenances, and did not cea&s;e &s;pitting phlegm mixed with black blood, and the pul&s;e &s;eldom &s;lower than 130 or 135 in a minute. This blood, from its
<PB N="295" REF="309">
dark colour, and from the many vibices and petechiae, &s;eems to have been venous blood; the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and the irregularity of the motion of the heart, are to be a&s;cribed to debility of that part of the &s;y&s;tem; as the extrava&s;ation of blood originated from the de|fect of venous ab&s;orption. The approximation of the&s;e two ca&s;es to &s;ea-&s;curvy is peculiar, and may allow them to be called &s;corbutus pul|monalis. Had the&s;e been younger &s;ubjects, and the paraly&s;is of the veins had only affected the lungs, it is probable the di&s;ea&s;e would have been a pulmonary con&s;umption.</P>
<P>La&s;t week I &s;aw a gentleman of Birmingham, who had for ten days laboured under great palpitation of his heart, which was &s;o di&s;|tinctly felt by the hand, as to di&s;countenance the idea of there being a fluid in the pericardium. He frequently &s;pit up mucus &s;tained with dark coloured blood, his pul&s;e very unequal and very weak, with cold hands and no&s;e. He could not lie down at all, and for about ten days pa&s;t could not &s;leep a minute together, but waked perpetually with great unea&s;ine&s;s. Could tho&s;e &s;ymptoms be owing to very ex|ten&s;ive adhe&s;ions of the lungs? or is this a &s;corbutus pulmonalis? After a few days he &s;uddenly got &s;o much better as to be able to &s;leep many hours at a time by the u&s;e of one grain of powder of foxglove twice a day, and a grain of opium at night. After a few days longer, the bark was exhibited, and the opium continued with &s;ome wine; and the palpitations of his heart became much relieved, and he reco|vered his u&s;ual degree of health.</P>
<P>In epileptic fits the patients frequently become black in the face, from the temporary paraly&s;is of the venous &s;y&s;tem of this part.

<P>THE term paraly&s;is has generally been u&s;ed to expre&s;s the lo&s;s of voluntary motion, as in the hemiplagia, but may with equal propriety be applied to expre&s;s the di&s;obediency of the mu&s;cular fibres to the other kinds of &s;timulus; as to tho&s;e of irritation or &s;en|&s;ation.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. There is a &s;pecies of atrophy, which has not been well under|&s;tood; when the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines have been long inured to the &s;timulus of too much &s;pirituous liquor, they at length, either by the too &s;udden omi&s;&s;ion of fermented or &s;pirituous potation, or from the gradual decay of nature, become in a certain degree paralytic; now it is ob&s;erved in the larger mu&s;cles of the body, when one &s;ide is paralytic, the other is more frequently in motion, owing to the le&s;s expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the paralytic limbs; &s;o in this ca&s;e the other part of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem acts with greater force, or with greater per&s;everance, in con&s;equence of the paraly&s;is of the lacteals; and the body becomes greatly emaciated in a &s;mall time.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="312">
I have &s;een &s;everal patients in this di&s;ea&s;e, of which the following are the circum&s;tances. 1. They were men about fifty years of age, and had lived freely in re&s;pect to fermented liquors. 2. They lo&s;t their appetite to animal food. 3. They became &s;uddenly emaciated to a great degree. 4. Their &s;kins were dry and rough. 5. They coughed and expectorated with difficulty a vi&s;cid phlegm. 6. The membrane of the tongue was dry and red, and liable to become ul|cerous.</P>
<P>The inability to dige&s;t animal food, and the con&s;equent di&s;ta&s;te to it, generally precedes the drop&s;y, and other di&s;ea&s;es, which originate from &s;pirituous potation. I &s;uppo&s;e when the &s;tomach becomes in|irritable, that there is at the &s;ame time a deficiency of ga&s;tric acid; hence milk &s;eldom agrees with the&s;e patients, unle&s;s it be previou&s;ly curdled, as they have not &s;ufficient ga&s;tric acid to curdle it; and hence vegetable food, which is it&s;elf ace&s;cent, will agree with their &s;tomachs longer than animal food, which requires more of the ga&s;tric acid for its dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>In this di&s;ea&s;e the &s;kin is dry from the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the cutaneous lymphatics, the fat is ab&s;orbed from the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the cellular lymphatics, the mucus of the lungs is too vi&s;cid to be ea&s;ily &s;pit up by the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the thinner parts of it, the membrana &s;neideriana becomes dry, covered with hardened mucus, and at length becomes inflamed and full of apthae, and either the&s;e &s;loughs, or pulmonary ulcers, terminate the &s;cene.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The immediate cau&s;e of drop&s;y is the paraly&s;is of &s;ome other branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, which are called lymphatics, and which open into the larger cavities of the body, or into the cells of the cellular membrane; whence tho&s;e cavities or cells become di&s;tend|ed with the fluid, which is hourly &s;ecreted into them for the purpo&s;e of lubricating their &s;urfaces. As is more fully explained in No. 5. of the next Section.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="313">
As tho&s;e lymphatic ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;t generally of a long neck or mouth, which drinks up its appropriated fluid, and of a conglobate gland, in which this fluid undergoes &s;ome change, it happens, that &s;ometimes the mouth of the lymphatic, and &s;ometimes the belly or glandular part of it, becomes totally or partially paralytic. In the former ca&s;e, where the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics become torpid or qui|e&s;cent, the fluid &s;ecreted on the &s;kin cea&s;es to be ab&s;orbed, and erodes the &s;kin by its &s;aline acrimony, and produces eruptions termed herpes, the di&s;charge from which is as &s;alt, as the tears, which are &s;ecreted too fa&s;t to be reab&s;orbed, as in grief, or when the puncta la|crymalia are ob&s;tructed, and which running down the cheek redden and inflame the &s;kin.</P>
<P>When the mouths of the lymphatics, which open on the mucous membrane of the no&s;trils, become torpid, as on walking into the air in a fro&s;ty morning; the mucus, which continues to be &s;ecreted, has not its aqueous and &s;aline part reab&s;orbed, which running over the upper lip inflames it, and has a &s;alt ta&s;te, if it falls on the tongue.</P>
<P>When the belly, or glandular part of the&s;e lymphatics, becomes torpid, the fluid ab&s;orbed by its mouth &s;tagnates, and forms a tumour in the gland. This di&s;ea&s;e is called the &s;crophula. If the&s;e glands &s;uppurate externally, they gradually heal, as tho&s;e of the neck; if they &s;uppurate without an opening on the external habit, as the me&s;enteric glands, a hectic fever en&s;ues, which de|&s;troys the patient; if they &s;uppurate in the lungs, a pulmonary con&s;umption en&s;ues, which is believed thus to differ from that de&s;cribed in the preceding Section, in re&s;pect to its &s;eat or proximate cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that matter produced by &s;uppuration will lie concealed in the body many weeks, or even months, without pro|ducing hectic fever; but as &s;oon as the wound is opened, &s;o as to
<PB N="300" REF="314">
admit air to the &s;urface of the ulcer, a hectic fever &s;upervenes, even in very few hours, which is probably owing to the azotic part of the atmo&s;phere rather than to the oxygene; becau&s;e tho&s;e me|dicines, which contain much oxygene, as the calces or oxydes of metals, externally applied, greatly contribute to heal ulcers, of the&s;e are the &s;olutions of lead and mercury, and copper in acids, or their precipitates.</P>
<P>Hence when ulcers are to be healed by the fir&s;t intention, as it is called, it is nece&s;&s;ary carefully to exclude the air from them. Hence we have one cau&s;e, which prevents pulmonary ulcers from healing, which is their being perpetually expo&s;ed to the air.</P>
<P>Both the dark-eyed patients, which are affected with pulmonary ulcers from deficient venous ab&s;orption, as de&s;cribed in Section XXVII. 2. and the light-eyed patients from deficient lymphatic ab|&s;orption, which we are now treating of, have generally large aper|tures of the iris; the&s;e large pupils of the eyes are a common mark of want of irritability; and it generally happens, that an increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility, that is, of motions in con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ation, attends the&s;e con&s;titutions. See Sect. XXXI. 2. Whence inflammations may occur in the&s;e from &s;tagnated fluids more frequently than in tho&s;e con&s;titutions, which po&s;&s;e&s;s more irritability and le&s;s &s;en|&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Great expectations in re&s;pect to the cure of con&s;umptions, as well as of many other di&s;ea&s;es, are produced by the very ingenious exer|tions of DR. BEDDOES; who has e&s;tabli&s;hed an apparatus for breathing various mixtures of airs or ga&s;&s;es, at the hot-wells near Bri&s;tol, which well de&s;erves the attention of the public.</P>
<P>DR. BEDDOES very ingeniou&s;ly concludes, from the florid colour of the blood of con&s;umptive patients, that it abounds in oxygene; and that the redne&s;s of their tongues, and lips, and the &s;ine blu&s;h of their cheeks &s;hew the pre&s;ence of the &s;ame principle, like fle&s;h reddened
<PB N="301" REF="315">
by nitre. And adds, that the circum&s;tance of the con&s;umptions of pregnant women being &s;topped in their progre&s;s during pregnancy, at which time their blood may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in part deprived of its oxygene, by oxygenating the blood of the foetus, is a forceable ar|gument in favour of this theory; which mu&s;t &s;oon be confirmed or confuted by his experiments.

<HEAD>I. Account of the Ab&s;orbent Sy&s;tem.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els in animal bodies con&s;i&s;ts of &s;e|veral branches, differing in re&s;pect to their &s;ituations, and to the fluids, which they ab&s;orb.</P>
<P>The inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents open their mouths on the internal &s;ur|faces of the inte&s;tines; their office is to drink up the chyle and the
<PB N="303" REF="317">
other fluids from the alimentary canal; and they are termed lacteals, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the other ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which have been termed lymphatics.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who&s;e mouths are di&s;per&s;ed on the external &s;kin, imbibe a great quantity of water from the atmo&s;phere, and a part of the per|&s;pirable matter, which does not evaporate, and are termed cutaneous ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the internal &s;urface of the bronchia, and which imbibe moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere, and a part of the bron|chial mucus, are called pulmonary ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, which open their innumerable mouths into the cells of the whole cellular membrane; and who&s;e u&s;e is to take up the fluid, which is poured into tho&s;e cells, after it has done its office there; may be called cellular ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the internal &s;urfaces of the membranes, which line the larger cavities of the body, as the thorax, abdomen, &s;crotum, pericardium, take up the mucus poured into tho&s;e ca|vities; and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of their re&s;pective cavities.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the internal &s;urfaces of the urinary bladder, gall-bladder, &s;alivary ducts, or other receptacles of &s;ecreted fluids, may take their names from tho&s;e fluids; the thinner parts of which it is their office to ab&s;orb: as urinary, bilious, or &s;alivary ab|&s;orbents.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many of the&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, both lacteals and lymphatics, like &s;ome of the veins, are replete with valves: which &s;eem de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of their fluids, or at lea&s;t to prevent their regur|gitation; where they are &s;ubjected to the intermitted pre&s;&s;ure of the mu&s;cular, or arterial actions in their neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The&s;e valves do not however appear to be nece&s;&s;ary to all the ab|&s;orbents, any more than to all the veins; &s;ince they are not found to exi&s;t in the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of fi&s;h; according to the di&s;coveries of the
<PB N="304" REF="318">
ingenious, and much lamented Mr. Hew&s;on. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. v. 59, Enquiries into the Lymph. Sy&s;t. p. 94.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els are al&s;o furni&s;hed with glands, which are called conglobate glands; who&s;e u&s;e is not at pre&s;ent &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated; but it is probable that they re&s;emble the conglomerate glands both in &s;tructure and in u&s;e, except that their ab&s;orbent mouths are for the conveniency of &s;ituation placed at a greater di&s;|tance from the body of the gland. The conglomerate glands open their mouths immediately into the &s;anguiferous ve&s;&s;els, which bring the blood, from whence they ab&s;orb their re&s;pective fluids, quite up to the gland: but the&s;e conglobate glands collect their adapted fluids from very di&s;tant membranes, or cy&s;ts, by means of mouths furni&s;h|ed with long necks for this purpo&s;e; and which are called lacteals, or lymphatics.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fluids, thus collected from various parts of the body, pa&s;s by means of the thoracic duct into the left &s;ubclavian near the ju|gular vein; except indeed that tho&s;e collected from the right &s;ide of the head and neck, and from the right arm, are carried into the right &s;ubclavian vein: and &s;ometimes even the lymphatics from the right &s;ide of the lungs are in&s;erted into the right &s;ubclavian vein; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the left &s;ide of the head open but ju&s;t into the &s;ummit of the thoracic duct.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem there are many ana&s;tomo&s;es of the ve&s;|&s;els, which &s;eem of great con&s;equence to the pre&s;ervation of health. The&s;e ana&s;tomo&s;es are di&s;covered by di&s;&s;ection to be very frequent between the inte&s;tinal and urinary lymphatics, as mentioned by Mr. Hew&s;on, (Phil. Tran&s;. v. 58).</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor do all the inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents &s;eem to terminate in the thoracic duct, as appears from &s;ome curious experiments of D. Monro, who gave madder to &s;ome animals, having previou&s;ly put a ligature on the thoracic duct, and found their bones, and the &s;erum of their blood, coloured red.</P>

<HEAD>II. The Valves of the Ab&s;orbent Sy&s;tem may &s;uffer their Fluids to regurgitate in &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE many valves, which occur in the progre&s;s of the lymphatic and lacteal ve&s;&s;els, would &s;eem in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles to the regurgita|tion of their contents. But as the&s;e valves are placed in ve&s;&s;els, which are indued with life, and are them&s;elves indued with life al&s;o; and are very irritable into tho&s;e natural motions, which ab&s;orb, or propel the fluids they contain; it is po&s;&s;ible, in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, where the&s;e valves or ve&s;&s;els are &s;timulated into unnatural exertions, or are become paralytic, that during the dia&s;tole of the part of the ve&s;&s;el to which the valve is attached, the valve may not &s;o completely clo&s;e, as to prevent the relap&s;e of the lymph or chyle. This is rendered more probable, by the experiments of injecting mercury, or water, or &s;uet, or by blowing air down the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; all which pa&s;s the valves very ea&s;ily, contrary to the natural cour&s;e of their fluids, when the ve&s;&s;els are thus a little forcibly dilated, as mentioned by Dr. Haller, Elem. Phy&s;iol. t. iii. &s;. 4.</P>
<P>"The valves of the thoracic duct are few, &s;ome a&s;&s;ert they are not more than twelve, and that they do not very accurately perform their office, as they do not clo&s;e the whole area of the duct, and thence may permit chyle to repa&s;s them downwards. In living animals, however, though not always, yet more frequently than in the dead, they prevent the chyle from returning. The principal of the&s;e valves is that, which pre&s;ides over the in&s;ertion of the thoracic duct, into the &s;ubclavian vein; many have believed this al&s;o to perform the of|fice of a valve, both to admit the chyle into the vein, and to preclude the blood from entering the duct; but in my opinion it is &s;carcely &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e." Haller, Elem. Phy&s;. t. vii. p. 226.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="306" REF="320">
2. The mouths of the lymphatics &s;eem to admit water to pa&s;s through them after death, the inverted way, ea&s;ier than the natural one; &s;ince an inverted bladder readily lets out the water with which it is filled; whence it may be inferred, that there is no ob&s;tacle at the mouths of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to prevent the regurgitation of their con|tained fluids.</P>
<P>I was induced to repeat this experiment, and having accurately tied the ureters and neck of a fre&s;h ox's bladder, I made an opening at the fundus of it; and then, having turned it in&s;ide outwards, filled it half full with water, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee it empty it&s;elf &s;o ha&s;tily. I thought the experiment more appo&s;ite to my purpo&s;e by &s;u&s;pending the bladder with its neck downwards, as the lymphatics are chiefly &s;pread upon this part of it; as &s;hewn by Dr. Wat&s;on, Philo&s;. Tran&s;. v. 59. p. 392.</P>
<P N="3">3. In &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, as in the diabetes and &s;crophula, it is probable the valves them&s;elves are di&s;ea&s;ed, and are thence incapable of pre|venting the return of the fluids they &s;hould &s;upport. Thus the valves of the aorta it&s;elf have frequently been found &s;chirrous, according to the di&s;&s;ections of Mon&s;. Lieutaud, and have given ri&s;e to an inter|rupted pul&s;e, and laborious palpitations, by &s;uffering a return of part of the blood into the heart. Nor are any parts of the body &s;o liable to &s;chirro&s;ity as the lymphatic glands and ve&s;&s;els, in&s;omuch that their &s;chirro&s;ities have acquired a di&s;tinct name, and been termed &s;chrophula.</P>
<P N="4">4. There are valves in other parts of the body, analogous to tho&s;e of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and which are liable, when di&s;ea&s;ed, to re|gurgitate their contents: thus the upper and lower orifices of the &s;tomach are clo&s;ed by valves, which, when too great quantities of warm water have been drank with a de&s;ign to promote vomiting, have &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ted the utmo&s;t efforts of the abdominal mu&s;cles, and diaphragm: yet, at other times, the upper valve, or cardia, ea&s;ily permits the evacuation of the contents of the &s;tomach; whil&s;t
<PB N="307" REF="321">
the inferior valve, or pylorus, permits the bile, and other contents of the duodenum, to regurgitate into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="5">5. The valve of the colon is well adapted to prevent the retrograde motion of the excrements; yet, as this valve is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a living power, in the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, either from &s;pa&s;m, or other unnatural ex|ertions, it keeps it&s;elf open, and either &s;uffers or promotes the retro|grade movements of the contents of the inte&s;tines below; as in rumi|nating animals the mouth of the fir&s;t &s;tomach &s;eems to be &s;o con|&s;tructed, as to facilitate or a&s;&s;i&s;t the regurgitation of the food; the rings of the oe&s;ophagus afterwards contracting them&s;elves in inverted order. De Haen, by means of a &s;yringe, forced &s;o much water into the rectum inte&s;tinum of a dog, that he vomited it in a full &s;tream from his mouth; and in the iliac pa&s;&s;ion above mentioned, excre|ments and cly&s;ter are often evacuated by the mouth. See Section XXV. 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. The puncta lacrymalia, with the lacrymal &s;ack and na&s;al duct, compo&s;e a complete gland, and much re&s;emble the inte&s;tinal canal the puncta lacrymalia are ab&s;orbent mouths, that take up the tears from the eye, when they have done their office there, and convey them into the no&s;trils; but when the na&s;al duct is ob&s;tructed, and the lacrymal &s;ack di&s;tended with its fluid, on pre&s;&s;ure with the finger the mouths of this gland (puncta lacrymalia) will readily di&s;gorge the fluid, they had previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed, back into the eye.</P>
<P N="7">7. As the capillary ve&s;&s;els receive blood from the arteries, and &s;e|parating the mucus, or per&s;pirable matter from it, convey the re|mainder back by the veins; the&s;e capillary ve&s;&s;els are a &s;et of glands, in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the liver, or other large congeries of glands. The beginnings of the&s;e capillary ve&s;&s;els have frequent ana&s;tomo&s;es into each other, in which circum&s;tance they are re&s;embled by the lacteals; and like the mouths or beginnings of other glands, they are a &s;et of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which drink up the blood which is brought to them by the arteries, as the chyle is drank
<PB N="308" REF="322">
up by the lacteals: for the circulation of the blood through the capil|laries is proved to be independent of arterial impul&s;e; &s;ince in the blu&s;h of &s;hame, and in partial inflammations, their action is increa&s;ed, with|out any increa&s;e of the motion of the heart.</P>
<P N="8">8. Yet not only the mouths, or beginnings of the&s;e ana&s;tomo&s;ing capillaries are frequently &s;een by micro&s;copes, to regurgitate &s;ome par|ticles of blood, during the &s;truggles of the animal; but retrograde motion of the blood, in the veins of tho&s;e animals, from the very heart to the extremity of the limbs, is ob&s;ervable, by intervals, during the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the dying creature. Haller, Elem. Phy&s;iol. t. i. p. 216. Now, as the veins have perhaps all of them a valve &s;ome|where between their extremities and the heart, here is ocular de|mon&s;tration of the fluids in this di&s;ea&s;ed condition of the animal, re|pa&s;&s;ing through venous valves: and it is hence highly probable, from the &s;tricte&s;t analogy, that if the cour&s;e of the fluids, in the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, could be &s;ubjected to micro&s;copic ob&s;ervation, they would al&s;o, in the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the animal, be &s;een to repa&s;s the valves, and the mouths of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which had previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed them, or pro|moted their progre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>III. Communication from the Alimentary Canal to the Bladder, by means of the Ab&s;orbent Ve&s;&s;els.</HEAD>
<P>MANY medical philo&s;ophers, both ancient and modern, have &s;u&s;|pected that there was a nearer communication between the &s;tomach and the urinary bladder, than that of the circulation: they were led into this opinion from the great expedition with which cold water, when drank to exce&s;s, pa&s;&s;es off by the bladder; and from the &s;imila|rity of the urine, when produced in this ha&s;ty manner, with the ma|terial that was drank.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="323">
The former of the&s;e circum&s;tances happens perpetually to tho&s;e who drink abundance of cold water, when they are much heated by exerci&s;e, and to many at the beginning of intoxication.</P>
<P>Of the latter, many in&s;tances are recorded by Etmuller, t. xi. p. 716. where &s;imple water, wine, and wine with &s;ugar, and emul|&s;ions, were returned by urine unchanged.</P>
<P>There are other experiments, that &s;eem to demon&s;trate the exi&s;tence of another pa&s;&s;age to the bladder, be&s;ides that through the kidneys. Thus Dr. Kratzen&s;tein put ligatures on the ureters of a dog, and then emptied the bladder by a catheter; yet in a little time the dog drank greedily, and made a quantity of water, (Di&s;putat. Morbor. Halleri. t. iv. p. 63.) A &s;imilar experiment is related in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, with the &s;ame event, (No. 65, 67, for the year 1670.)</P>
<P>Add to this, that in &s;ome morbid ca&s;es the urine has continued to pa&s;s, after the &s;uppuration or total de&s;truction of the kidneys; of which many in&s;tances are referred to in the Elem. Phy&s;iol. t. vii. p. 379. of Dr. Haller.</P>
<P>From all which it mu&s;t be concluded, that &s;ome fluids have pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;tomach or abdomen, without having gone through the &s;anguiferous circulation: and as the bladder is &s;upplied with many lymphatics, as de&s;cribed by Dr. Wat&s;on, in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;. v. 59. p. 392. and as no other ve&s;&s;els open into it be&s;ides the&s;e and the ure|ters, it &s;eems evident, that the unnatural urine, produced as above de|&s;cribed, when the ureters were tied, or the kidneys obliterated, was carried into the bladder by the retrograde motions of the urinary branch of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The more certainly to a&s;certain the exi&s;tence of another communi|cation between the &s;tomach and bladder, be&s;ides that of the circula|tion, the following experiment was made, to which I mu&s;t beg your patient attention:&mdash;A friend of mine (June 14, 1772) on drinking re|peatedly of cold &s;mall punch, till he began to be intoxicated, made a
<PB N="310" REF="324">
quantity of colourle&s;s urine. He then drank about two drams of nitre di&s;&s;olved in &s;ome of the punch, and eat about twenty &s;talks of boiled a&s;paragus: on continuing to drink more of the punch, the next urine that he made was quite clear, and without &s;mell; but in a little time another quantity was made, which was not quite &s;o colourle&s;s, and had a &s;trong &s;mell of the a&s;paragus: he then lo&s;t about four ounces of blood from the arm.</P>
<P>The &s;mell of a&s;paragus was not at all perceptible in the blood, nei|ther when fre&s;h taken, nor the next morning, as my&s;elf and two others accurately attended to; yet this &s;mell was &s;trongly perceived in the urine, which was made ju&s;t before the blood was taken from his arm.</P>
<P>Some bibulous paper, moi&s;tened in the &s;erum of this blood, and &s;uffered to dry, &s;hewed no &s;igns of nitre by its manner of burning. But &s;ome of the &s;ame paper, moi&s;tened in the urine, and dried, on being ignited, evidently &s;hewed the pre&s;ence of nitre. This blood and the urine &s;tood &s;ome days expo&s;ed to the &s;un in the open air, till they were evaporated to about a fourth of their original quantity, and began to &s;tink: the paper, which was then moi&s;tened with the con|centrated urine, &s;hewed the pre&s;ence of much nitre by its manner of burning; whil&s;t that moi&s;tened with the blood &s;hewed no &s;uch ap|pearance at all.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that certain fluids at the beginning of intoxica|tion, find another pa&s;&s;age to the bladder be&s;ides the long cour&s;e of the arterial circulation; and as the inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents are joined with the urinary lymphatics by frequent ana&s;tomo&s;es, as Hew&s;on has demon|&s;trated; and as there is no other road, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that the&s;e fluids pa&s;s into the bladder by the urinary branch of the lym|phatics, which has its motions inverted during the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the animal.</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had been &s;ome weeks affected with jaundice, and who&s;e urine was in con&s;equence of a very deep yellow, took &s;ome
<PB N="311" REF="325">
cold &s;mall punch, in which was di&s;&s;olved about a dram of nitre; he then took repeated draughts of the punch, and kept him&s;elf in a cool room, till on the approach of &s;light intoxication he made a large quantity of water; this water had a &s;light yellow tinge, as might be expected from a &s;mall admixture of bile &s;ecreted from the kidneys; but if the whole of it had pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;anguiferous ve&s;&s;els, which were now replete with bile (his whole &s;kin being as yellow as gold) would not this urine al&s;o, as well as that he had made for weeks before, have been of a deep yellow? Paper dipped in this water, and dryed, and ignited, &s;hewed evident marks of the pre&s;ence of nitre, when the flame was blown out.</P>

<HEAD>IV. The Phaenomena of the Diabetes explained, and of &s;ome Diarrhoeas.</HEAD>
<P>THE phaenomena of many di&s;ea&s;es are only explicable from the re|trograde motions of &s;ome of the branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem; as the great and immediate flow of pale urine in the beginning of drunk|enne&s;s; in hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms; from being expo&s;ed to cold air; or to the influence of fear or anxiety.</P>
<P>Before we endeavour to illu&s;trate this doctrine, by de&s;cribing the phaenomena of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, we mu&s;t premi&s;e one circum&s;tance; that all the branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem have a certain &s;ympathy with each other, in&s;omuch that when one branch is &s;timulated into unu&s;ual kinds or quantities of motion, &s;ome other branch has its mo|tions either increa&s;ed, or decrea&s;ed, or inverted at the &s;ame time. This kind of &s;ympathy can only be proved by the concurrent te&s;ti|mony of numerous facts, which will be related in the cour&s;e of the work. I &s;hall only add here, that it is probable, that this &s;ympathy does not depend on any communication of nervous filaments, but on
<PB N="312" REF="326">
habit; owing to the various branches of this &s;y&s;tem having frequently been &s;timulated into action at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>There are a thou&s;and in&s;tances of involuntary motions a&s;&s;ociated in this manner; as in the act of vomiting, while the motions of the &s;to|mach and oe&s;ophagus are inverted, the pul&s;ations of the arterial &s;y&s;tem by a certain &s;ympathy become weaker; and when the bowels or kid|neys are &s;timulated by poi&s;on, a &s;tone, or inflammation, into more violent action; the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus by &s;ympathy invert their motions.</P>

When any one drinks a moderate quantity of vinous &s;pirit, the whole &s;y&s;tem acts with more energy by con&s;ent with the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, as is &s;een from the glow on the &s;kin, and the increa&s;e of &s;trength and activity; but when a greater quantity of this inebriating material is drank, at the &s;ame time that the lacteals are excited into greater action to ab&s;orb it; it frequently happens, that the urinary branch of ab&s;orbents, which is connected with the lacteals by many ana&s;tomo&s;es, inverts its motions, and a great quantity of pale unani|malized urine is di&s;charged. By this wi&s;e contrivance too much of an unnece&s;&s;ary fluid is prevented from entering the circulation&mdash;This may be called the drunken diabetes, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other temporary diabetes, which occur in hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;es, and from con|tinued fear or anxiety.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this idle ingurgitation of too much vinous &s;pirit be daily prac|ti&s;ed, the urinary branch of ab&s;orbents at length gains an habit of in|verting its motions, whenever the lacteals are much &s;timulated; and the whole or a great part of the chyle is thus daily carried to the blad|der without entering the circulation, and the body becomes emaci|ated. This is one kind of chronic diabetes, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others by the ta&s;te and appearance of the urine; which is &s;weet, and the colour of whey, and may be termed the chyliferous diabetes.</P>

3. Many children have a &s;imilar depo&s;ition of chyle in their urine, from the irritation of worms in their inte&s;tines, which &s;timulating the mouths of the lacteals into unnatural action, the urinary branch of the ab&s;orbents becomes inverted, and carries part of the chyle to the bladder: part of the chyle al&s;o has been carried to the iliac and lumbar glands, of which in&s;tances are recorded by Haller, t. vii. 225&punc; and which can be explained on no other theory: but the di&s;&s;ections of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem of the human body, which have yet been publi&s;hed, are not &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive for our purpo&s;e; yet if we may rea&s;on from comparative anatomy, this tran&s;lation of chyle to the bladder is much illu&s;trated by the account given of this &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els in a turtle, by Mr. Hew&s;on, who ob&s;erved, "That the lacteals near the root of the me&s;entery ana&s;tomo&s;e, &s;o as to form a net-work, from which &s;everal large branches go into &s;ome con&s;iderable lymphatics ly|ing near the &s;pine; and which can be traced almo&s;t to the anus, and particularly to the kidneys. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. v. 59. p. 199&mdash;Enquiries, p. 74.</P>
<P N="4">4. At the &s;ame time that the urinary branch of ab&s;orbents, in the beginning of diabetes, is excited into inverted action, the cellular branch is excited by the &s;ympathy above mentioned, into more ener|getic action; and the fat, that was before depo&s;ited, is reab&s;orbed and thrown into the blood ve&s;&s;els; where it floats, and was mi&s;taken for chyle, till the late experiments of the ingenious Mr. Hew&s;on demon|&s;trated it to be fat.</P>
<P>This appearance of what was mi&s;taken for chyle in the blood, which was drawn from the&s;e patients, and the ob&s;tructed liver, which very frequently accompanies this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eems to have led Dr. Mead to &s;u&s;pect the diabetes was owing to a defect of &s;anguifica|tion; and that the &s;chirro&s;ity of the liver was the original cau&s;e of it: but as the &s;chirrhus of the liver is mo&s;t frequently owing to the &s;ame cau&s;es, that produce the diabetes and drop&s;ies; namely, the great u&s;e
<PB N="314" REF="328">
of fermented liquors; there is no wonder they &s;hould exi&s;t together, without being the con&s;equence of each other.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the cutaneous branch of ab&s;orbents gains a habit of being ex|cited into &s;tronger action, and imbibes greater quantities of moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere, at the &s;ame time that the urinary branch has its motions inverted, another kind of diabetes is formed, which may be termed the aqueous diabetes. In this diabetes the cutaneous ab|&s;orbents frequently imbibe an amazing quantity of atmo&s;pheric moi&s;|ture; in&s;omuch that there are authentic hi&s;tories, where many gallons a day, for many weeks together, above the quantity that has been drank, have been di&s;charged by urine.</P>
<P>Dr. Keil, in his Medicina Statica, found that he gained eighteen ounces from the moi&s;t air of one night; and Dr. Percival affirms, that one of his hands imbibed, after being well chafed, near an ounce and half of water, in a quarter of an hour. (Tran&s;act. of the College, London, vol. ii. p. 102). Home's Medic. Facts, p. 2. &s;ect. 3.</P>
<P>The pale urine in hy&s;terical women, or which is produced by fear or anxiety, is a temporary complaint of this kind; and it would in re|ality be the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, if it was confirmed by habit.</P>
<P N="6">6. The purging &s;tools, and pale urine, occa&s;ioned by expo&s;ing the naked body to cold air, or &s;prinkling it with cold water, originate from a &s;imilar cau&s;e; for the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics being &s;uddenly expo&s;ed to cold become torpid, and cea&s;e, or nearly cea&s;e, to act; whil&s;t, by the &s;ympathy above de&s;cribed, not only the lymphatics of the bladder and inte&s;tines cea&s;e al&s;o to ab&s;orb the more aqueous and &s;aline part of the fluids &s;ecreted into them; but it is probable that the&s;e lymphatics invert their motions, and return the fluids, which were previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed, into the inte&s;tines and bladder. At the very in&s;tant that the body is expo&s;ed naked to the cold air, an unu&s;ual movement is felt in the bowels; as is experienced by boys going into the cold bath: this could not occur from an ob&s;truction of
<PB N="315" REF="329">
the per&s;pirable matter, &s;ince there is not time for that to be returned to the bowels by the cour&s;e of the circulation.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a chronic aqueous diarrhoea, in which the atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture, drank up by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics, is poured into the inte&s;tines, by the retrograde motions of the lacteals. This di&s;ea&s;e is mo&s;t &s;imilar to the aqueous diabetes, and is frequently exchanged for it: a di&s;tinct in&s;tance of this is recorded by Benninge|rus, Cent. v. Ob&s;. 98. in which an aqueous diarrhoea &s;ucceeded an aqueous diabetes, and de&s;troyed the patient. There is a curious ex|ample of this, de&s;cribed by Symp&s;on (De Re Medica)&mdash;"A young man (&s;ays he) was &s;eized with a fever, upon which a diarrhoea came on, with great &s;tupor; and he refu&s;ed to drink any thing, though he was parched up with exce&s;&s;ive heat: the better to &s;upply him with moi&s;|ture, I directed his feet to be immer&s;ed in cold water; immediately I ob&s;erved a wonderful decrea&s;e of water in the ve&s;&s;el, and then an im|petuous &s;tream of a fluid, &s;carcely coloured, was di&s;charged by &s;tool, like a cataract."</P>
<P N="7">7. There is another kind of diarrhoea, which has been called cae|liaca; in this di&s;ea&s;e the chyle, drank up by the lacteals of the &s;mall inte&s;tines, is probably poured into the large inte&s;tines, by the retro|grade motions of their lacteals: as in the chyliferous diabetes, the chyle is poured into the bladder, by the retrograde motions of the urinary branch of ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>The chyliferous diabetes, like this chyliferous diarrhoea, produces &s;udden atrophy; &s;ince the nouri&s;hment, which ought to &s;upply the hourly wa&s;te of the body, is expelled by the bladder, or rectum: whil&s;t the aqueous diabetes, and the aqueous diarrhoea produce exce&s;|&s;ive thir&s;t; becau&s;e the moi&s;ture, which is obtained from the atmo|&s;phere, is not conveyed to the thoracic receptacle, as it ought to be, but to the bladder, or lower inte&s;tines; whence the chyle, blood, and whole &s;y&s;tem of glands, are robbed of their proportion of hu|midity.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="316" REF="330">
8. There is a third &s;pecies of diabetes, in which the urine is mu|cilaginous, and appears ropy in pouring it from one ve&s;&s;el into another; and will &s;ometimes coagulate over the fire. This di&s;ea&s;e appears by intervals, and cea&s;es again, and &s;eems to be occa&s;ioned by a previous drop&s;y in &s;ome part of the body. When &s;uch a collection is reab|&s;orbed, it is not always returned into the circulation; but the &s;ame irritation that &s;timulates one lymphatic branch to reab&s;orb the depo|&s;ited fluid, inverts the urinary branch, and pours it into the bladder. Hence this mucilaginous diabetes is a cure, or the con&s;equence of a cure, of a wor&s;e di&s;ea&s;e, rather than a di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Cotunnius gave half an ounce of cream of tartar, every morning, to a patient, who had the ana&s;arca; and he voided a great quantity of urine; a part of which, put over the fire, coagulated, on the evaporation of half of it, &s;o as to look like the white of an egg. De I&s;chiade Nervos.</P>
<P>This kind of diabetes frequently precedes a drop&s;y; and has this remarkable circum&s;tance attending it, that it generally happens in the night; as during the recumbent &s;tate of the body, the fluid, that was accumulated in the cellular membrane, or in the lungs, is more rea|dily ab&s;orbed, as it is le&s;s impeded by its gravity. I have &s;een more than one in&s;tance of this di&s;ea&s;e. Mr. D. a man in the decline of life, who had long accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to &s;pirituous liquor, had &s;welled legs, and other &s;ymptoms of approaching ana&s;arca; about once in a week, or ten days, for &s;everal months, he was &s;eized, on going to bed, with great general unea&s;ine&s;s, which his attendants re&s;embled to an hy&s;teric fit; and which terminated in a great di&s;charge of vi&s;cid urine; his legs became le&s;s &s;welled, and he continued in better health for &s;ome days afterwards. I had not the opportunity to try if this urine would coagulate over the fire, when part of it was evaporated, which I imagine would be the criterion of this kind of diabetes; as the mu|cilaginous fluid depo&s;ited in the cells and cy&s;ts of the body, which have no communication with the external air, &s;eems to acquire, by &s;tagna|tion,
<PB N="317" REF="331">
this property of coagulation by heat, which the &s;ecreted mucus of the inte&s;tines and bladder do not appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s; as I have found by experiment: and if any one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this coagulable urine was &s;eparated from the blood by the kidneys, he may recollect, that in the mo&s;t inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, in which the blood is mo&s;t replete, or mo&s;t ready to part with the coagulable lymph, none of this appears in the urine.</P>
<P N="9">9. Different kinds of diabetes require different methods of cure. For the fir&s;t kind, or chyliferous diabetes, after clearing the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, by ipecacuanha and rhubarb, to evacuate any acid ma|terial, which may too powerfully &s;timulate the mouths of the lacteals, repeated and large do&s;es of tincture of cantharides have been much re|commended. The &s;pecific &s;timulus of this medicine, on the neck of the bladder, is likely to excite the numerous ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which are &s;pread on that part, into &s;tronger natural actions, and by that means prevent their retrograde ones; till, by per&s;i&s;ting in the u&s;e of the medicine, their natural habits of motions might again be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. Another indication of cure, requires &s;uch medicines, as by lin|ing the inte&s;tines with mucilaginous &s;ub&s;tances, or with &s;uch as con|&s;i&s;t of &s;mooth particles, or which chemically de&s;troy the acrimony of their contents, may prevent the too great action of the inte&s;tinal ab|&s;orbents. For this purpo&s;e, I have found the earth precipitated from a &s;olution of alum, by means of fixed alcali, given in the do&s;e of half a dram every &s;ix hours, of great advantage, with a few grains of rhu|barb, &s;o as to procure a daily evacuation.</P>
<P>The food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of materials that have the lea&s;t &s;timulus, with calcareous water, as of Bri&s;tol and Matlock; that the mouths of the lactcals may be as little &s;timulated as is nece&s;&s;ary for their proper ab&s;orption; le&s;t with their greater exertions, &s;hould be connected by &s;ympathy, the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method may be employed with equal advantage in the aqueous diabetes, &s;o great is the &s;ympathy between the &s;kin and the
<PB N="318" REF="332">
&s;tomach. To which, however, &s;ome application to the &s;kin might be u&s;efully added; as rubbing the patient all over with oil, to prevent the too great action of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents. I knew an ex|periment of this kind made upon one patient with apparent ad|vantage.</P>
<P>The mucilaginous diabetes will require the &s;ame treatment, which is mo&s;t efficacious in the drop&s;y, and will be de&s;cribed below. I mu&s;t add, that the diet and medicines above mentioned, are &s;trongly re|commended by various authors, as by Morgan, Willis, Harris, and Etmuller; but more hi&s;tories of the &s;ucce&s;sful treatment of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are wanting to fully a&s;certain the mo&s;t efficacious methods of cure.</P>
<P>In a letter from Mr. Charles Darwin, dated April 24, 1778, Edin|burgh, is the &s;ub&s;equent pa&s;&s;age:&mdash;"A man who had long laboured under a diabetes died ye&s;terday in the clinical ward. He had for &s;ome time drank four, and pa&s;&s;ed twelve pounds of fluid daily; each pound of urine contained an ounce of &s;ugar. He took, without con&s;iderable relief, gum kino, &s;anguis draconis melted with alum, tincture of can|tharides, i&s;ingla&s;s, gum arabic, crabs eyes, &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, and eat ten or fifteen oy&s;ters thrice a day. Dr. Home, having read my the&s;is, bled him, and found that neither the fre&s;h blood nor the &s;erum ta&s;ted &s;weet. His body was opened this morning&mdash;every vi&s;cus appeared in a &s;ound and natural &s;tate, except that the left kidney had a very &s;mall pelvis, and that there was a con&s;iderable enlargement of mo&s;t of the me&s;enteric lymphatic glands. I intend to in&s;ert this in my the&s;is, as it coincides with the experiment, where &s;ome a&s;paragus was eaten at the beginning of intoxication, and its &s;mell perceived in the urine, though not in the blood."</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e of chyliferous diabetes is extracted from &s;ome letters of Mr. Hughs, to who&s;e unremitted care the infirmary at Staf|ford for many years was much indebted. Dated October 10, 1778.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="333">
Richard Davis, aged 33, a white&s;mith by trade, had drank hard by intervals; was much troubled with &s;weating of his hands, which incommoded him in his occupation, but which cea&s;ed on his frequent|ly dipping them in lime. About &s;even months ago he began to make large quantities of water; his legs are oedematous, his belly ten&s;e, and he complains of a ri&s;ing in his throat, like the globus hy&s;tericus: he eats twice as much as other people, drinks about fourteen pints of &s;mall beer a day, be&s;ides a pint of ale, &s;ome milk-porridge, and a ba&s;on of broth, and he makes about eighteen pints of water a day.</P>
<P>He tried alum, dragon's blood, &s;teel, blue vitriol, and cantharides in large quantities, and duly repeated, under the care of Dr. Under|hill, but without any effect; except that on the day after he omitted the cantharides, he made but twelve pints of water, but on the next day this good effect cea&s;ed again.</P>
<P>November 21.&mdash;He made eighteen pints of water, and he now, at Dr. Darwin's reque&s;t, took a grain of opium every four hours, and five grains of aloes at night; and had a flannel &s;hirt given him.</P>
<P>22.&mdash;Made &s;ixteen pints. 23.&mdash;Thirteen pints: drinks le&s;s.</P>
<P>24.&mdash;Increa&s;ed the opium to a grain and quarter every four hours: he made twelve pints.</P>
<P>25.&mdash;Increa&s;ed the opium to a grain and half: he now makes ten pints; and drinks eight pints in a day.</P>
<P>The opium was gradually increa&s;ed during the next fortnight, till he took three grains every four hours, but without any further dimu|nition of his water. During the u&s;e of the opium he &s;weat much in the nights, &s;o as to have large drops &s;tand on his face and all over him. The quantity of opium was then gradually decrea&s;ed, but not to|tally omitted, as he continued to take about a grain morning and evening.</P>
<P>January 17.&mdash;He makes fourteen pints of water a day. Dr. Un|derhill now directed him two &s;cruples of common ro&s;in triturated
<PB N="320" REF="334">
with as much &s;ugar, every &s;ix hours; and three grains of opium every night.</P>
<P>19.&mdash;Makes fifteen pints of water: &s;weats at night.</P>
<P>21.&mdash;Makes &s;eventeen pints of water; has twitchings of his limbs in a morning, and pains of his legs: he now takes a dram of ro&s;in for a do&s;e, and continues the opium.</P>
<P>23.&mdash;Water more coloured, and reduced to &s;ixteen pints, and he thinks has a bracki&s;h ta&s;te.</P>
<P>26.&mdash;Water reduced to fourteen pints.</P>
<P>28.&mdash;Water thireen pints: he continues the opium, and takes four &s;cruples of the ro&s;in for a do&s;e.</P>
<P>February 1.&mdash;Water twelve pints.</P>
<P>4.&mdash;Water eleven pints: twitchings le&s;s: takes five &s;cruples for a do&s;e.</P>
<P>8.&mdash;Water ten pints: has had many &s;tools.</P>
<P>12.&mdash;Appetite le&s;s: purges very much.</P>
<P>After this the ro&s;in either purged him, or would not &s;tay on his &s;tomach; and he gradually relap&s;ed nearly to his former condition, and in a few months &s;unk under the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>October 3, Mr. Hughs evaporated two quarts of the water, and obtained from it four ounces and half of a hard and brittle &s;accharine ma&s;s, like treacle which had been &s;ome time boiled. Four ounces of blood, which he took from his arm with de&s;ign to examine it, had the common appearances, except that the &s;erum re&s;embled chee&s;e|whey; and that on the evidence of four per&s;ons, two of whom did not know what it was they ta&s;ted, <HI>the &s;erum had a &s;alti&s;h ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it appears, that the &s;accharine matter, with which the urine of the&s;e patients &s;o much abounds, does not enter the blood|ve&s;&s;els like the nitre and a&s;paragus mentioned above; but that the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion re&s;embles the proce&s;s of the germination of ve|getables, or of making barley into malt; as the va&s;t quantity of &s;ugar
<PB N="321" REF="335">
found in the urine mu&s;t be made from the food which he took (which was double that taken by others), and from the fourteen pints of &s;mall beer which he drank. And, &s;econdly, as the &s;erum of the blood was not &s;weet, the chyle appears to have been conveyed to the bladder without entering the circulation of the blood, &s;ince &s;o large a quantity of &s;ugar, as was found in the urine, namely, twenty ounces a day, could not have previou&s;ly exi&s;ted in the blood without being perceptible to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>November 1. Mr. Hughes di&s;&s;olved two drams of nitre in a pint of a decoction of the roots of a&s;paragus, and added to it two ounces of tincture of rhubarb: the patient took a fourth part of this mixture every five minutes, till he had taken the whole.&mdash;In about half an hour he made eighteen ounces of water, which was very manife&s;tly tinged with the rhubarb; the &s;mell of a&s;paragus was doubtful.</P>
<P>He then lo&s;t four ounces of blood, the &s;erum of which was not &s;o opake as that drawn before, but of a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t, as the &s;erum of the blood u&s;ually appears.</P>
<P>Paper, dipped three or four times in the tinged urine and dried again, did not &s;cintillate when it was &s;et on fire; but when the flame was blown out, the fire ran along the paper for half an inch; which, when the &s;ame paper was unimpregnated, it would not do; nor when the &s;ame paper was dipped in urine made before he took the nitre, and dried in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Paper, dipped in the &s;erum of the blood and dried in the &s;ame manner as in the urine, did not &s;cintillate when the flame was blown out, but burnt exactly in the &s;ame manner as the &s;ame paper dipped in the &s;erum of blood drawn from another per&s;on.</P>
<P>This experiment, which is copied from a letter of Mr. Hughes, as well as the former, &s;eems to evince the exi&s;tence of another pa&s;&s;age from the inte&s;tines to the bladder, in this di&s;ea&s;e, be&s;ides that of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem; and coincides with the curious experiment re|lated in &s;ection the third, except that the &s;mell of the a&s;paragus was
<PB N="322" REF="336">
not here perceived, owing perhaps to the roots having been made u&s;e of in&s;tead of the heads.</P>
<P>The ri&s;ing in the throat of this patient, and the twitchings of his limbs, &s;eem to indicate &s;ome &s;imilarity between the diabetes and the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, be&s;ides the great flow of pale urine, which is common to them both.</P>
<P>Perhaps if the me&s;enteric glands were nicely in&s;pected in the di&s;|&s;ections of the&s;e patients; and if the thoracic duct, and the larger branches of the lacteals, and if the lymphatics, which ari&s;e from the bladder, were well examined by injection, or by the knife, the cau&s;e of diabetes might be more certainly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The opium alone, and the opium with the ro&s;in, &s;eem much to have &s;erved this patient, and might probably have effected a cure, if the di&s;ea&s;e had been &s;lighter, or the medicine had been exhibited, be|fore it had been confirmed by habit during the &s;even months it had continued. The increa&s;e of the quantity of water on beginning the large do&s;es of ro&s;in was probably owing to his omitting the morning do&s;es of opium.</P>

<HEAD>V. The Phaenomena of Drop&s;ies explained.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. SOME inebriates have their paroxy&s;ms of inebriety terminated by much pale urine, or profu&s;e &s;weats, or vomiting, or &s;tools; others have their paroxy&s;ms terminated by &s;tupor, or &s;leep, without the above evacuations.</P>
<P>The former kind of the&s;e inebriates have been ob&s;erved to be more liable to diabetes and drop&s;y; and the latter to gout, gravel, and le|pro&s;y. Evoe! attend ye bacchanalians! &s;tart at this dark train of evils, and, amid your immode&s;t je&s;ts, and idiot laughter, recollect,
<Q><L>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="337">
In tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to diabetes and drop&s;y, the ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els are naturally more irritable than in the latter; and by being fre|quently di&s;turbed or inverted by violent &s;timulus, and by their too great &s;ympathy with each other, they become at length either entire|ly paralytic, or are only &s;u&s;ceptible of motion from the &s;timulus of very acrid materials; as every part of the body, after having been u&s;ed to great irritations, becomes le&s;s affected by &s;maller ones. Thus we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h objects in the night, for &s;ome time after we come out of a &s;trong light, though the iris is pre&s;ently dilated; and the air of a &s;ummer evening appears cold, after we have been expo&s;ed to the heat of the day.</P>
<P>There are no cells in the body, where drop&s;y may not be produced, if the lymphatics cea&s;e to ab&s;orb that mucilaginous fluid, which is perpetually depo&s;ited in them, for the purpo&s;e of lubricating their &s;urfaces.</P>
<P>If the lymphatic branch, which opens into the cellular membrane, either does its office imperfectly, or not at all; the&s;e cells become re|plete with a mucilaginous fluid, which, after it has &s;tagnated &s;ome time in the cells, will coagulate over the fire; and is erroneou&s;ly called water. Wherever the &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e is, (unle&s;s in the lungs or other pendent vi&s;cera) the mucilaginous liquid above mentioned will &s;ub&s;ide to the mo&s;t depending parts of the body, as the feet and legs, when tho&s;e are lower than the head and trunk; for all the&s;e cells have communications with each other.</P>
<P>When the cellular ab&s;orbents are become in&s;en&s;ible to their u&s;ual irritations, it mo&s;t frequently happens, but not always, that the cuta|neous branch of ab&s;orbents, which is &s;trictly a&s;&s;ociated with them, &s;uffers the like inability. And then, as no water is ab&s;orbed from the atmo&s;phere, the urine is not only le&s;s diluted at the time of its &s;ecre|tion, and con&s;equently in le&s;s quantity and higher coloured: but great thir&s;t is at the &s;ame time induced, for as no water is ab&s;orbed from the atmo&s;phere to dilute the chyle and blood, the lacteals and other ab|&s;orbent
<PB N="324" REF="338">
ve&s;&s;els, which have not lo&s;t their powers, are excited into more con&s;tant or more violent action, to &s;upply this deficiency; whence the urine becomes &s;till le&s;s in quantity, and of a deeper colour, and turbid like the yolk of an egg, owing to a greater ab&s;orption of its thinner parts. From this &s;tronger action of tho&s;e ab&s;orbents, which &s;till retain their irritability, the fat is al&s;o ab&s;orbed, and the whole body becomes emaciated. This increa&s;ed exertion of &s;ome branches of the lymphatics, while others are totally or partially pa|ralytic, is re&s;embled by what con&s;tantly occurs in the hemiplagia; when the patient has lo&s;t the u&s;e of the limbs on one &s;ide, he is in|ce&s;&s;antly moving tho&s;e of the other; for the moving power, not hav|ing acce&s;s to the paralytic limbs, becomes redundant in tho&s;e which are not di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The paucity of urine and thir&s;t cannot be explained from a greater quantity of mucilaginous fluid being depo&s;ited in the cellular mem|brane: for though the&s;e &s;ymptoms have continued many weeks, or even months, this collection frequently does not amount to more than very few pints. Hence al&s;o the difficulty of promoting copious &s;weats in ana&s;arca is accounted for, as well as the great thir&s;t, paucity of urine, and lo&s;s of fat; &s;ince, when the cutaneous branch of ab&s;or|bents is paralytic, or nearly &s;o, there is already too &s;mall a quantity of aqueous fluid in the blood: nor can the&s;e torpid cutaneous lympha|tics be readily excited into retrograde motions.</P>
<P>Hence likewi&s;e we under&s;tand, why in the a&s;cites, and &s;ome other drop&s;ies, there is often no thir&s;t, and no paucity of urine; in the&s;e ca&s;es the cutaneous ab&s;orbents continue to do their office.</P>
<P>Some have believed, that drop&s;ies were occa&s;ioned by the inability of the kidneys, from having only ob&s;erved the paucity of urine; and have thence laboured much to obtain diuretic medicines; but it is daily ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who die of a total inability to make water, do not become drop&s;ical in con&s;equence of it: Fernelius mentions one, who laboured under a perfect &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine during twenty days
<PB N="325" REF="339">
before his death, and yet had no &s;ymptoms of drop&s;y. Pathol. 1. vi. c. 8. From the &s;ame idea many phy&s;icians have re&s;trained their pa|tients from drinking, though their thir&s;t has been very urgent; and &s;ome ca&s;es have been publi&s;hed, where this cruel regimen has been thought advantageous: but others of nicer ob&s;ervation are of opinion, that it has always aggravated the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the patient; and though it has abated his &s;wellings, yet by inducing a fever it has ha&s;tened his di&s;&s;olution. See Tran&s;actions of the College, London, vol. ii. p. 235. Ca&s;es of Drop&s;y by Dr. G. Baker.</P>
<P>The cure of ana&s;arca, &s;o far as re&s;pects the evacuation of the accu|mulated fluid, coincides with the idea of the retrograde action of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem. It is well known that vomits, and other drugs, which induce &s;ickne&s;s or nau&s;ea; at the &s;ame time that they evacuate the &s;tomach, produce a great ab&s;orption of the lymph accumulated in the cellular membrane. In the operation of a vomit, not only the motions of the &s;tomach and duodenum become inverted, but al&s;o tho&s;e of the lymphatics and lacteals, which belong to them; whence a great quantity of chyle and lymph is perpetually poured into the &s;to|mach and inte&s;tines, during the operation, and evacuated by the mouth. Now at the &s;ame time, other branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, viz. tho&s;e which open on the cellular membrane, are brought into more energetic action, by the &s;ympathy above mentioned, and an increa&s;e of their ab&s;orption is produced.</P>
<P>Hence repeated vomits, and cupreous &s;alts, and &s;mall do&s;es of &s;quill or foxglove, are &s;o efficacious in this di&s;ea&s;e. And as dra&s;tic purges act al&s;o by inverting the motions of the lacteals; and thence the other branches of lymphatics are induced into more powerful natural action, by &s;ympathy, and drink up the fluids from all the cells of the body; and by their ana&s;tomo&s;es, pour them into the lacteal branches; which, by their inverted actions, return them into the inte&s;tines; and they are thus evacuated from the body:&mdash;the&s;e purges al&s;o are u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in di&s;charging the accumulated fluid in ana&s;arca.</P>

<P N="1">1. A lady, between forty and fifty years of age, had been indi&s;|po&s;ed &s;ome time, was then &s;eized with cough and fever, and after|wards expectorated much dige&s;ted mucus.

<P>The difficulty of breathing was twice con&s;iderably relieved by &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacuanha, which operated upwards and downwards, but recurred in a few days: &s;he was then directed a decoction of foxglove, (digitalis purpurea) prepared by boiling four ounces of the fre&s;h leaves from two pints of water to one pint; to which was added two ounces of vinous &s;pirit: &s;he took three large &s;poonfuls of this mixture every two hours, till &s;he had taken it four times; a continued &s;ickne&s;s &s;u|pervened, with frequent vomiting, and a copious flow of urine: the&s;e evacuations continued at intervals for two or three days, and

In this &s;ituation a phy|&s;ician of eminence directed him to ab&s;tain from all animal food and fermented liquor, during which regimen all his complaints increa&s;ed; he now became emaciated, and totally lo&s;t his appetite; his pul&s;e very irregular both in velocity and &s;trength; with great difficulty of breathing, and &s;ome &s;welling of his legs; yet he could lie down ho|rizontally in his bed, though he got little &s;leep, and pa&s;&s;ed a due

<P>One night he had a mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;weat all over his body and limbs, which quite deluged his bed, and for a day or two &s;omewhat relieved his difficulty of breathing, and his pul&s;e became le&s;s irregular: this copious &s;weat recurred three or four times at the intervals of five or &s;ix days, and repeatedly alleviated his &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>He was directed one large &s;poonful of the above decoction of fox|glove every hour, till it procured &s;ome con&s;iderable evacuation: after he had taken it eleven &s;ucce&s;&s;ive hours he had a few liquid &s;tools, at|tended with a great flow of urine, which la&s;t had a dark tinge, as if mixed with a few drops of blood: he continued &s;ick at intervals for two days, but his breath became quite ea&s;y, and his pul&s;e quite regu|lar, the &s;welling of his legs di&s;appeared, and his appetite and &s;leep returned.</P>
<P>He then took three grains of white vitriol twice a day, with &s;ome bitter medicines, and a grain of opium with five grains of rhubarb every night; was advi&s;ed to eat fle&s;h meat, and &s;pice, as his &s;tomach would bear it, with &s;mall beer, and a few gla&s;&s;es of wine; and had i&s;&s;ues made in his thighs; and has &s;uffered no relap&s;e.</P>

<P>THERE have been hi&s;tories given of chronical immoderate &s;weat|ings, which bear &s;ome analogy to the diabetes. Dr. Willis mentions a lady then living, who&s;e &s;weats were for many years &s;o profu&s;e, that all her bed-clothes were not only moi&s;tened, but deluged with them every night; and that many ounces, and &s;ometimes pints, of this &s;weat, were received in ve&s;&s;els properly placed, as it trickled down her body. He adds, that &s;he had great thir&s;t, had taken many medicines, and &s;ubmitted to various rules of life, and changes of climate, but &s;till continued to have the&s;e immoderate &s;weats.

<P>Dr. Willis has al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the &s;udor anglicanus which ap|peared in England, in 1483, and continued till 1551, was in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;imilar to the diabetes; and as Dr. Caius, who &s;aw this di&s;|ea&s;e, mentions the vi&s;cidity, as well as the quantity of the&s;e &s;weats, and adds, that the extremities were often cold, when the internal parts were burnt up with heat and thir&s;t, with great and &s;peedy emaciation and debility: there is great rea&s;on to believe, that the fluids were ab|&s;orbed from the cells of the body by the cellular and cy&s;tic branches of the lymphatics, and poured on the &s;kin by the retrograde motions of the cutaneous ones.</P>
<P>Sydenham has recorded, in the &s;tationary fever of the year 1685, the vi&s;cid &s;weats flowing from the head, which were probably from the &s;ame &s;ource as tho&s;e in the &s;weating plague above mentioned.</P>
<P>It is very common in drop&s;ies of the che&s;t or lungs to have the difficulty of breathing relieved by copious &s;weats, flowing from the head and neck. Mr. P. about 50 years of age, had for many weeks
<PB N="334" REF="348">
been afflicted with ana&s;arca of his legs and thighs, attended with dif|ficulty of breathing; and had repeatedly been relieved by &s;quill, other bitters, and chalybeates.&mdash;One night the difficulty of breathing became &s;o great, that it was thought he mu&s;t have expired; but &s;o copious a &s;weat came out of his head and neck, that in a few hours &s;ome pints, by e&s;timation, were wiped off from tho&s;e parts, and his breath was for a time relieved. This dy&s;pnoea and the&s;e &s;weats recurred at intervals, and after &s;ome weeks he cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. The &s;kin of his head and neck felt cold to the hand, and appeared pale at the time the&s;e &s;weats flowed &s;o abundantly; which is a proof, that they were produced by an inverted motion of the ab&s;orbents of tho&s;e parts: for &s;weats, which are the con|&s;equence of an increa&s;ed action of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, are always at|tended with a warmth of the &s;kin, greater than is natural, and a more florid colour; as the &s;weats from exerci&s;e, or tho&s;e that &s;ucceed the cold fits of agues. Can any one explain how the&s;e partial &s;weats &s;hould relieve the difficulty of breathing in ana&s;arca, but by &s;uppo&s;ing that the pul|monary branch of ab&s;orbents drank up the fluid in the cavity of the tho|rax, or in the cells of the lungs, and threw it on the &s;kin, by the retro|grade motions of the cutaneous branch? for, if we could &s;uppo&s;e, that the increa&s;ed action of the cutaneous glands or capillaries poured upon the &s;kin this fluid, previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed from the lungs; why is not the whole &s;urface of the body covered with &s;weat? why is not the &s;kin warm?

<HEAD>VII. Tran&s;lations of Matter, of Chyle, of Milk, of Urine. Operation of purging Drugs applied externally.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE tran&s;lations of matter from one part of the body to another, can only receive an explanation from the doctrine of the occa&s;ional re|trograde motions of &s;ome branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem: for how can matter, ab&s;orbed and mixed with the whole ma&s;s of blood, be &s;o ha&s;tily collected again in any one part? and is it not an immutable law, in animal bodies, that each gland can &s;ecrete no other, but its own proper fluid? which is, in part, fabricated in the very gland by an animal proce&s;s, which it there undergoes: of the&s;e purulent tran&s;|lations innumerable and very remarkable in&s;tances are recorded.</P>
<P N="2">2. The chyle, which is &s;een among the materials thrown up by vio|lent
<PB N="336" REF="350">
vomiting, or in purging &s;tools, can only come thither by its having been poured into the bowels by the inverted motions of the lacteals: for our aliment is not converted into chyle in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines by a chemical proce&s;s, but is made in the very mouths of the lacteals; or in the me&s;enteric glands; in the &s;ame manner as other &s;ecreted fluids are made by an animal proce&s;s in their adapted glands.</P>
<P>Here a curious phaenomenon in the exhibition of mercury is worth explaining:&mdash;If a moderate do&s;e of calomel, as &s;ix or ten grains, be &s;wallowed, and within one or two days a cathartic is given, a &s;aliva|tion is prevented: but after three or four days, a &s;alivation having come on, repeated purges every day, for a week or two, are required to eliminate the mercury from the con&s;titution. For this acrid me|tallic preparation, being ab&s;orbed by the mouths of the lacteals, con|tinues, for a time arre&s;ted by the me&s;enteric glands, (as the variolous or venereal poi&s;ons &s;well the &s;ubaxillar or inguinal glands): which, during the operation of a cathartic, is returned into the inte&s;tines by the inverted action of the lacteals, and thus carried out of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Hence we under&s;tand the u&s;e of vomits or purges, to tho&s;e who have &s;wallowed either contagious or poi&s;onous materials, even though exhibited a day or even two days after &s;uch accidents; namely, that by the retrograde motions of the lacteals and lymphatics, the material &s;till arre&s;ted in the me&s;enteric, or other glands, may be eliminated from the body.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many in&s;tances of milk and chyle found in ulcers are given by Haller, El. Phy&s;iol. t. vii. p. 12, 23, which admit of no other expla|nation than by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the chyle, imbibed by one branch of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, was carried to the ulcer, by the inverted motions of another branch of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mrs. P. on the &s;econd day after delivery, was &s;eized with a vio|lent purging, in which, though opiates, mucilages, the bark, and te&s;tacea were profu&s;ely u&s;ed, continued many days, till at length &s;he recovered. During the time of this purging, no milk could be drawn
<PB N="337" REF="351">
from her brea&s;ts; but the &s;tools appeared like the curd of milk broken into &s;mall pieces. In this ca&s;e, was not the milk taken up from the follicles of the pectoral glands, and thrown on the inte&s;tines, by a re|trogre&s;&s;ion of the inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents? for how can we for a moment &s;u&s;pect that the mucous glands of the inte&s;tines could &s;eparate pure milk from the blood? Doctor Smelly has ob&s;erved, that loo&s;e &s;tools, mixed with milk, which is curdled in the inte&s;tines, frequently re|lieves the turge&s;cency of the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who &s;tudiou&s;ly repel their milk. Ca&s;es in Midwifery, 43, No. 2. 1.</P>
<P N="5">5. J. F. Meckel ob&s;erved in a patient, who&s;e urine was in &s;mall quantity and high coloured, that a copious &s;weat under the arm-pits, of a perfectly urinous &s;mell, &s;tained the linen; which cea&s;ed again when the u&s;ual quantity of urine was di&s;charged by the urethra. Here we mu&s;t believe from analogy, that the urine was fir&s;t &s;ecreted in the kidneys, then re-ab&s;orbed by the increa&s;ed action of the urinary lym|phatics, and la&s;tly carried to the axillae by the retrograde motions of the lymphatic branches of tho&s;e parts. As in the jaundice it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that the bile &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;ecreted by the liver, and re-ab|&s;orbed into the circulation, to produce the yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin; as was formerly demon&s;trated by the late Dr. Monro, (Edin. Medical E&s;&s;ays) and if in this patient the urine had been re-ab&s;orbed into the ma&s;s of blood, as the bile in the jaundice, why was it not detected in other parts of the body, as well as in the arm-pits?</P>
<P N="6">6. Cathartic and vermifuge medicines applied externally to the ab|domen, &s;eem to be taken up by the cutaneous branch of lymphatics, and poured on the inte&s;tines by the retrograde motions of the lacteals, without having pa&s;&s;ed the circulation.</P>
<P>For when the dra&s;tic purges are taken by the mouth, they excite the lacteals of the inte&s;tines into retrograde motions, as appears from the chyle, which is found coagulated among the faeces, as was &s;hewn above, (&s;ect 2 and 4.) And as the cutaneous lymphatics are joined with the lacteals of the inte&s;tines, by frequent ana&s;tomo&s;es; it would
<PB N="338" REF="352">
be more extraordinary, when a &s;trong purging drug, ab&s;orbed by the &s;kin, is carried to the ana&s;tomo&s;ing branches of the lacteals unchanged, if it &s;hould not excite them into retrograde action as efficaciou&s;ly, as if it was taken by the mouth, and mixed with the food of the &s;to|mach.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. Circum&s;tances by which the Fluids, that are effu&s;ed by the retro|grade Motions of the ab&s;orbent Ve&s;&s;els, are di&s;tingui&s;hed.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE frequently ob&s;erve an unu&s;ual quantity of mucus or other fluids in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, although the action of the glands, by which tho&s;e fluids are &s;eparated from the blood, is not unu&s;ually increa&s;ed; but when the power of ab&s;orption alone is dimini&s;hed. Thus the ca|tarrhal humour from the no&s;trils of &s;ome, who ride in fro&s;ty weather; and the tears, which run down the cheeks of tho&s;e, who have an ob|&s;truction of the puncta lacrymalia; and the ichor of tho&s;e phagedenic ulcers, which are not attended with inflammation, are all in&s;tances of this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e fluids however are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by their abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic &s;alts; whence they inflame the circumjacent &s;kin: thus in the catarrh the upper lip becomes red and &s;welled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the &s;altne&s;s of its ta&s;te. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corro|&s;ive tears, and the ichor of &s;ome herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the contiguous parts, and is pungently &s;alt to the ta&s;te, as &s;ome pa|tients have informed me.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t, on the contrary, tho&s;e fluids, which are effu&s;ed by the re|trograde action of the lymphatics, are for the mo&s;t part mild and in|nocent; as water, chyle, and the natural mucus: or they take their properties from the materials previou&s;ly ab&s;orbed, as in the coloured
<PB N="339" REF="353">
or vinous urine, or that &s;cented with a&s;paragus, de&s;cribed be|fore.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whenever the &s;ecretion of any fluid is increa&s;ed, there is at the &s;ame time an increa&s;ed heat in the part; for the &s;ecreted fluid, as the bile, did not previou&s;ly exi&s;t in the ma&s;s of blood, but a new combi|nation is produced in the gland. Now as &s;olutions are attended with cold, &s;o combinations are attended with heat; and it is probable the &s;um of the heat given out by all the &s;ecreted fluids of animal bodies may be the cau&s;e of their general heat above that of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Hence the fluids derived from increa&s;ed &s;ecretions are readily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from tho&s;e originating from the retrograde motions of the lymphatics: thus an increa&s;e of heat either in the di&s;ea&s;ed parts, or diffu&s;ed over the whole body, is perceptible, when copious bilious &s;tools are con&s;equent to an inflamed liver; or a copious mucous &s;aliva|tion from the inflammatory angina.</P>
<P N="3">3. When any &s;ecreted fluid is produced in an unu&s;ual quantity, and at the &s;ame time the power of ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed in equal pro|portion, not only the heat of the gland becomes more inten&s;e, but the &s;ecreted fluid becomes thicker and milder, its thinner and &s;aline parts being re-ab&s;orbed: and the&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hable both by their greater con&s;i&s;tence, and by their heat, from the fluids, which are effu&s;ed by the retrograde motions of the lymphatics; as is ob&s;ervable towards the termination of gonorrhoea, catarrh, chincough, and in tho&s;e ulcers, which are &s;aid to abound with laudable pus.</P>
<P N="4">4. When chyle is ob&s;erved in &s;tools, or among the materials eject|ed by vomit, we may be confident it mu&s;t have been brought thither by the retrograde motions of the lacteals; for chyle does not previou&s;ly exi&s;t amid the contents of the inte&s;tines, but is made in the very mouths of the lacteals, as was before explained.</P>
<P N="5">5. When chyle, milk, or other extraneous fluids are found in the urinary bladder, or in any other excretory receptacle of a gland; no one can for a moment believe, that the&s;e have been collected from
<PB N="340" REF="354">
the ma&s;s of blood by a morbid &s;ecretion, as it contradicts all ana|logy.

<HEAD>IX. Retrograde Motions of Vegetable Juices.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are be&s;ides &s;ome motions of the &s;ap in vegetables, which bear analogy to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and as the vegetable tribes are by many philo&s;ophers held to be inferior animals, it may be a matter of curio&s;ity at lea&s;t to ob&s;erve, that their ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els &s;eem evidently, at times, to be capable of a retrograde motion. Mr. Perault cut off a forked branch of a tree, with the leaves on; and inverting one of the forks into a ve&s;&s;el of water, ob&s;erved, that the leaves on the other branch continued green much longer than tho&s;e of a &s;imilar branch, cut off from the &s;ame tree; which &s;hews, that the water from the ve&s;&s;el was carried up one part of the forked branch, by the retrograde motion of its ve&s;&s;els, and &s;upplied nutriment &s;ome time to the other part of the branch, which was out of the water. And the celebrated Dr. Hales found, by numerous very accurate experiments, that the &s;ap of trees ro&s;e upwards during the warmer hours of the day, and in part de&s;cended again during the cooler ones. Vegetable Statics.</P>
<P>It is well known that the branches of willows, and of many other trees, will either take root in the earth or engraft on other trees, &s;o as to have their natural direction inverted, and yet flouri&s;h with vigour.</P>
<P>Dr. Hope has al&s;o made this plea&s;ing experiment, after the manner of Hales&mdash;he has placed a forked branch, cut from one tree, erect be|tween two others; then cutting off a part of the bark from one fork
<PB N="341" REF="355">
applied it to a &s;imilar branch of one of the trees in its vicinity; and the &s;ame of the other fork; &s;o that a tree is &s;een to grow &s;u&s;pended in the air, between two other trees; which &s;upply their fo&s;ter friend with due nouri&s;hment. <Q><L>Miranturque novas frondes, et non &s;ua poma.</L></Q></P>
<P>All the&s;e experiments clearly evince, that the juices of vegetables can occa&s;ionally pa&s;s either upwards or downwards in their ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<HEAD>X. Objections an&s;wered.</HEAD>
<P>THE following experiment, at fir&s;t view, would &s;eem to invalidate this opinion of the retrograde motions of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>About a gallon of milk having been given to an hungry &s;wine, he was &s;uffered to live about an hour, and was then killed by a &s;troke or two on his head with an axe.&mdash;On opening his belly the lacteals were well &s;een filled with chyle; on irritating many of the branches of them with a knife, they did not appear to empty them&s;elves ha&s;tily; but they did however carry forwards their contents in a little time.</P>
<P>I then pa&s;&s;ed a ligature round &s;everal branches of lacteals, and irri|tated them much with a knife beneath the ligature, but could not make them regurgitate their contained fluid into the bowels.</P>
<P>I am not indeed certain, that the nerve was not at the &s;ame time included in the ligature, and thus the lymphatic rendered unirritable or lifele&s;s; but this however is certain, that it is not any quantity of any &s;timulus, which induces the ve&s;&s;els of animal bodies to revert their motions; but a certain quantity of a certain &s;timulus, as appears from wounds in the &s;tomach, which do not produce vomiting; and wounds of the inte&s;tines, which do not produce the cholera morbus.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="356">
At Nottingham, a few years ago, two &s;hoemakers quarrelled, and one of them with a knife, which they u&s;e in their occupation, &s;tabbed his companion about the region of the &s;tomach. On opening the ab|domen of the wounded man after his death the food and medicines he had taken were in part found in the cavity of the belly, on the out&s;ide of the bowels; and there was a wound about half an inch long at the bottom of the &s;tomach; which I &s;uppo&s;e was di&s;tended with liquor and food at the time of the accident; and thence was more li|able to be injured at its bottom: but during the whole time he lived, which was about ten days, he had no efforts to vomit, nor ever even complained of being &s;ick at the &s;tomach! Other ca&s;es &s;imilar to this are mentioned in the philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>Thus, if you vellicate the throat with a feather, nau&s;ea is produced; if you wound it with a penknife, pain is induced, but not &s;ickne&s;s. So if the &s;oles of the feet of children or their armpits are tickled, convul&s;ive laughter is excited, which cea&s;es the moment the hand is applied, &s;o as to rub them more forcibly.</P>
<P>The experiment therefore above related upon the lacteals of a dead pig, which were included in a &s;trict ligature, proves nothing; as it is not the quantity, but the kind of &s;timulus, which excites the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els into retrograde motion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>XI. The Cau&s;es which induce the retrograde Motions of animal Ve&s;&s;els; and the Medicines by which the natural Motions are re&s;tored.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SUCH is the con&s;truction of animal bodies, that all their parts, which are &s;ubjected to le&s;s &s;timuli than nature de&s;igned, perform their functions with le&s;s accuracy: thus, when too watery or too ace&s;cent food is taken into the &s;tomach, indige&s;tion, and flatulency, and heart|burn &s;ucceed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another law of irritation, connate with our exi&s;tence, is, that
<PB N="343" REF="357">
all tho&s;e parts of the body, which have previou&s;ly been expo&s;ed to too great a quantity of &s;uch &s;timuli, as &s;trongly affect them, become for &s;ome time afterwards di&s;obedient to the natural quantity of their adapt|ed &s;timuli.&mdash;Thus the eye is incapable of &s;eeing objects in an ob&s;cure room, though the iris is quite dilated, after having been expo&s;ed to the meridian &s;un.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a third law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies, which have been lately &s;ubjected to le&s;s &s;timulus, than they have been accu&s;tomed to, when they are expo&s;ed to their u&s;ual quantity of &s;ti|mulus, are excited into more energetic motions: thus when we come from a du&s;ky cavern into the glare of daylight, our eyes are dazzled; and after emerging from the cold bath, the &s;kin becomes warm and red.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a fourth law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies, which are &s;ubjected to &s;till &s;tronger &s;timuli for a length of time, become torpid, and refu&s;e to obey even the&s;e &s;tronger &s;timuli; and thence do their offices very imperfectly.&mdash;Thus, if any one looks earne&s;tly for &s;ome minutes on an area, an inch diameter, of red &s;ilk, placed on a &s;heet of white paper, the image of the &s;ilk will gradually become pale, and at length totally vani&s;h.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nor is it the nerves of &s;en&s;e alone, as the optic and auditory nerves, that thus become torpid, when the &s;timulus is withdrawn or their irritability decrea&s;ed; but the motive mu&s;cles, when they are deprived of their natural &s;timuli, or of their irritability, become torpid and paralytic; as is &s;een in the tremulous hand of the drunkard in a morning; and in the awkward &s;tep of age.</P>
<P>The hollow mu&s;cles al&s;o, of which the various ve&s;&s;els of the body are con&s;tructed, when they are deprived of their natural &s;timuli, or of their due degree of irritability, not only become tremulous, as the ar|terial pul&s;ations of dying people; but al&s;o frequently invert their motions, as in vomiting, in hy&s;teric &s;uffocations, and diabetes above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="358">
I mu&s;t beg your patient attention, for a few moments whil&s;t I en|deavour to explain, how the retrograde actions of our hollow mu&s;cles are the con&s;equence of their debility; as the tremulous actions of the &s;olid mu&s;cles are the con&s;equence of their debility. When, through fatigue, a mu&s;cle can act no longer; the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles, either by their inanimate ela&s;ticity, or by their animal action, draw the limb into a contrary direction: in the &s;olid mu&s;cles, as tho&s;e of locomotion, their actions are a&s;&s;ociated in tribes, which have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ynchronous action only; hence when they are fatigued, only a &s;ingle contrary effort takes place; which is either tremulous, when the fa|tigued mu&s;cles are again immediately brought into action; or it is a pandiculation, or &s;tretching, where they are not immediately again brought into action.</P>
<P>Now the motions of the hollow mu&s;cles, as they in general pro|pel a fluid along their cavities, are a&s;&s;ociated in trains, which have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive actions: hence when one ring of &s;uch a mu&s;cle is fatigued from its too great debility, and is brought into retrograde action, the next ring from its a&s;&s;ociation falls &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into retrograde action; and &s;o on throughout the whole canal. See Sect. XXV. 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. But as the retrograde motions of the &s;tomach, oe&s;ophagus, and fauces in vomiting are, as it were, apparent to the eye; we &s;hall con&s;ider this operation more minutely, that the &s;imilar operations in the more recondite parts of our &s;y&s;tem may be ea&s;ier under&s;tood.</P>
<P>From certain nau&s;eous ideas of the mind, from an ungrateful ta&s;te in the mouth, or from foetid &s;mells, vomiting is &s;ometimes in&s;tantly excited; or even from a &s;troke on the head, or from the vibratory motions of a &s;hip; all which originate from a&s;&s;ociation, or &s;ympathy. See Sect. XX. on Vertigo.</P>
<P>But when the &s;tomach is &s;ubjected to a le&s;s &s;timulus than is na|tural, according to the fir&s;t law of irritation mentioned above, its motions become di&s;turbed, as in hunger; fir&s;t pain is p roduced,
<PB N="345" REF="359">
then &s;ickne&s;s, and at length vain efforts to vomit, as many authors inform us.</P>
<P>But when a great quantity of wine, or of opium, is &s;wallowed, the retrograde motions of the &s;tomach do not occur till after &s;everal minutes, or even hours; for when the power of &s;o &s;trong a &s;timulus cea&s;es, according to the &s;econd law of irritation, mentioned above, the peri&s;taltic motions become tremulous, and at length retrograde; as is well known to the drunkard, who on the next morning has &s;ickne&s;s and vomitings.</P>
<P>When a &s;till greater quantity of wine, or of opium, or when nau|&s;eous vegetables, or &s;trong bitters, or metallic &s;alts, are taken into the &s;tomach, they quickly induce vomiting; though all the&s;e in le&s;s do&s;es excite the &s;tomach into more energetic action, and &s;trengthen the dige&s;tion; as the flowers of chamomile, and the vitriol of zinc: for, according to the fourth law of irritation, the &s;tomach will not long be obedient to a &s;timulus &s;o much greater than is natural; but its action becomes fir&s;t tremulous and then retrograde.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the motions of any ve&s;&s;els become retrograde, le&s;s heat of the body is produced; for in paroxy&s;ms of vomiting, of hy&s;teric affections, of diabetes, of a&s;thma, the extremities of the body are cold: hence we may conclude, that the&s;e &s;ymptoms ari&s;e from the debility of the parts in action; for an increa&s;e of mu&s;cular action is always attended with increa&s;e of heat.</P>
<P N="8">8. But as animal debility is owing to defect of &s;timulus, or to defect of irritability, as &s;hewn above, the method of cure is ea&s;ily deduced: when the va&s;cular mu&s;cles are not excited into their due action by the natural &s;timuli, we &s;hould exhibit tho&s;e medicines, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;till greater degree of &s;timulus; among&s;t the&s;e are the foetids, the vo|latiles, aromatics, bitters, metallic &s;alts, opiates, wine, which indeed &s;hould be given in &s;mall do&s;es, and frequently repeated. To the&s;e &s;hould be added con&s;tant, but moderate exerci&s;e, cheerfulne&s;s of mind, and change of country to a warmer climate; and perhaps occa&s;ionally the external &s;timulus of bli&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="360">
It is al&s;o frequently u&s;eful to dimini&s;h the quantity of natural &s;timulus for a &s;hort time, by which afterwards the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem becomes increa&s;ed; according to the third law of irritation above-mentioned, hence the u&s;e of baths &s;omewhat colder than ani|mal heat, and of equitation in the open air.</P>

<P>The catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es owing to the retrograde motions of lymphatics is here omitted, as it will appear in the &s;econd volume of this work. The following is the conclu&s;ion to this the&s;is of Mr. CHARLES DARWIN.</P>
<P>THUS have I endeavoured in a conci&s;e manner to explain the nu|merous di&s;ea&s;es, which deduce their origin from the inverted motions of the hollow mu&s;cles of our bodies: and it is probable, that Saint Vitus's dance, and the &s;tammering of &s;peech, originate from a &s;imilar inverted order of the a&s;&s;ociated motions of &s;ome of the &s;olid mu&s;cles; which, as it is foreign to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I &s;hall not here di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>I beg, illu&s;trious profe&s;&s;ors, and ingenious fellow-&s;tudents, that you will recollect how difficult a ta&s;k I have attempted, to evince the retrograde motions of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, when the ve&s;&s;els them|&s;elves for &s;o many ages e&s;caped the eyes and gla&s;&s;es of philo&s;ophers: and if you are not yet convinced of the truth of this theory, hold, I entreat you, your minds in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, till ANATOMY draws her &s;word with happier omens, cuts a&s;under the knots, which entangle PHY|SIOLOGY; and, like an augur in&s;pecting the immolated victim, an|nounces to mankind the wi&s;dom of HEAVEN.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">1. FROM the ingurgitation of &s;pirituous liquors into the &s;tomach and duodenum, the termination of the common bile-duct in that bowel becomes &s;timulated into unnatural action, and a greater quan|tity of bile is produced from all the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the liver, by the a&s;&s;ociation of their motions with tho&s;e of their excretory ducts; as has been explained in Section XXIV. and XXV. but as all parts of the body, that have been affected with &s;tronger &s;timuli for any length of time, become le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of motion, from their natural weaker &s;timuli, it follows, that the motions of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els, and in con&s;equence the &s;ecretion of bile, is le&s;s than is natural during the intervals of &s;obriety. 2. If this ingurgitation of &s;pirituous liquors has been daily continued in con&s;iderable quantity, and is then &s;ud|denly intermitted, a languor or paraly&s;is of the common bile-duct is induced; the bile is prevented from being poured into the inte&s;tines; and as the bilious ab&s;orbents are &s;timulated into &s;tronger action by its accumulation, and by the acrimony or vi&s;cidity, which it acquires by
<PB N="348" REF="362">
delay, it is ab&s;orbed, and carried to the receptacle of the chyle; or otherwi&s;e the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the liver, by the above-mentioned &s;timulus, invert their motions, and regurgitate their contents into the blood, as &s;ometimes happens to the tears in the lachrymal &s;ack, &s;ee Sect. XXIV. 2. 7. and one kind of jaundice is brought on.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to believe, that the bile is mo&s;t frequently returned into the circulation by the inverted motions of the&s;e hepatic glands, for the bile does not &s;eem liable to be ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics, for it &s;oaks through the gall-ducts, and is frequently found in the cellular membrane. This kind of jaundice is not generally attended with pain, neither at the extremity of the bile-duct, where it enters the duodenum, nor on the region of the gall-bladder.</P>
<P>Mr. S. a gentleman between 40 and 50 years of age, had had the jaundice about &s;ix weeks, without pain, &s;ickne&s;s, or fever; and had taken emetics, cathartics, mercurials, bitters, chalybeates, e&s;&s;ential oil, and ether, without apparent advantage. On a &s;uppo&s;ition that the ob&s;truction of the bile might be owing to the paraly&s;is, or torpid action of the common bile-duct, and the &s;timulants taken into the &s;tomach &s;eeming to have no effect, I directed half a &s;core &s;mart electric &s;hocks from a coated bottle, which held about a quart, to be pa&s;&s;ed through the liver, and along the cour&s;e of the common gall|duct, as near as could be gue&s;&s;ed, and on that very day the &s;tools became yellow; he continued the electric &s;hocks a few days more, and his &s;kin gradually became clear.</P>
<P N="3">3. The bilious vomiting and purging, that affects &s;ome people by intervals of a few weeks, is a le&s;s degree of this di&s;ea&s;e; the bile-duct is le&s;s irritable than natural, and hence the bile becomes accumulated in the gall-bladder, and hepatic ducts, till by its quantity, acrimony or vi&s;cidity, a greater degree of irritation is produced, and it is &s;uddenly evacuated, or la&s;tly from the ab&s;orption of the more liquid parts of the bile, the remainder becomes in&s;pi&s;&s;ated, and chry&s;tallizes into
<PB N="349" REF="363">
ma&s;&s;es too large to pa&s;s, and forms another kind of jaundice, where the bile-duct is not quite paralytic, or has regained its irritability.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is attended with much pain, which at fir&s;t is felt at the pit of the &s;tomach, exactly in the centre of the body, where the bile-duct enters the duodenum; afterwards, when the &s;ize of the bile-&s;tones increa&s;e, it is al&s;o felt on the right &s;ide, where the gall-bladder is &s;ituated. The former pain at the pit of the &s;tomach recurs by in|tervals, as the bile-&s;tone is pu&s;hed again&s;t the neck of the duct; like the paroxy&s;ms of the &s;tone in the urinary bladder, the other is a more dull and con&s;tant pain.</P>
<P>Where the&s;e bile-&s;tones are too large to pa&s;s, and the bile-ducts po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;en&s;ibility, this becomes a very painful and hopele&s;s di&s;ea&s;e. I made the following experiments with a view to their chemical &s;olution.</P>
<P>Some fragments of the &s;ame bile-&s;tone were put into the weak &s;pirit of marine &s;alt, which is &s;old in the &s;hops, and into &s;olution of mild alcali; and into a &s;olution of cau&s;tic alcali; and into oil of tur|pentine; without their being di&s;&s;olved. All the&s;e mixtures were after &s;ome time put into a heat of boiling water, and then the oil of turpentine di&s;&s;olved its fragments of bile-&s;tone, but no alteration was produced upon tho&s;e in the other liquids except &s;ome change of their colour.</P>
<P>Some fragments of the &s;ame bile-&s;tone were put into vitriolic aether, and were quickly di&s;&s;olved without additional heat. Might not aether mixed with yolk of egg or with honey be given advan|tageou&s;ly in bilious concretions?</P>
<P>I have in two in&s;tances &s;een from 30 to 50 bile-&s;tones come away by &s;tool, about the &s;ize of large pea&s;e, after having given &s;ix grains of calomel in the evening, and four ounces of oil of almonds or olives on the &s;ucceeding morning. I have al&s;o given half a pint of good olive or almond oil as an emetic during the painful fit, and
<PB N="350" REF="364">
repeated it in half an hour, if the fir&s;t did not operate, with frequent good effect.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another di&s;ea&s;e of the liver, which I have &s;everal times ob|&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ts in the inability or paraly&s;is of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els. This di&s;ea&s;e has generally the &s;ame cau&s;e as the preceding one, the too frequent potation of &s;pirituous liquors, or the too &s;udden omi&s;&s;ion of them, after the habit is confined; and is greater or le&s;s in propor|tion, as the whole or a part of the liver is affected, and as the inability or paraly&s;is is more or le&s;s complete.</P>
<P>This pal&s;y of the liver is known from the&s;e &s;ymptoms, the pa|tients have generally pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, have drank fer|mented liquors daily, but perhaps not been opprobrious drunkards; they lo&s;e their appetite, then their fle&s;h and &s;trength dimini&s;h in con|&s;equence, there appears no bile in their &s;tools, nor in their urine, nor is any hardne&s;s or &s;welling perceptible on the region of the liver. But what is peculiar to this di&s;ea&s;e, and di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others at the fir&s;t glance of the eye, is the bombycinous colour of the &s;kin, which, like that of full-grown &s;ilkworms, has a degree of tran&s;|parency with a yellow tint not greater than is natural to the &s;erum of the blood.</P>
<P>Mr. C. and Mr. B. both very &s;trong men, between 50 and 60 years of age, who had drank ale at their meals in&s;tead of &s;mall beer, but were not reputed hard-drinkers, &s;uddenly became weak, lo&s;t their appetite, fle&s;h, and &s;trength, with all the &s;ymptoms above enu|merated, and died in about two months from the beginning of their malady. Mr. C. became ana&s;arcous a few days before his death, and Mr. B. had frequent and great haemorrhages from an i&s;&s;ue, and &s;ome parts of his mouth, a few days before his death. In both the&s;e ca&s;es calomel, bitters and chalybeates were repeatedly u&s;ed without effect.</P>
<P>One of the patients de&s;cribed above, Mr. C, was by trade a plumber; both of them could dige&s;t no food, and died apparently for
<PB N="351" REF="365">
want of blood. Might not the transfu&s;ion of blood be u&s;ed in the&s;e ca&s;es with advantage?</P>
<P N="5">5. When the paraly&s;is of the hepatic glands is le&s;s complete, or le&s;s univer&s;al, a &s;chirro&s;ity of &s;ome part of the liver is induced; for the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els retaining &s;ome of their living power take up a fluid from the circulation, without being &s;ufficiently irritable to carry it forwards to their excretory ducts; hence the body, or receptacle of each gland, becomes inflated, and this di&s;ten&s;ion increa&s;es, till by its very great &s;timulus inflammation is produced, or till tho&s;e parts of the vi&s;cus become totally paralytic. This di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hable from the foregoing by the palpable hardne&s;s or largene&s;s of the liver; and as the hepatic glands are not totally paralytic, or the whole liver not affected, &s;ome bile continues to be made. The inflammations of this vi&s;cus, con&s;equent to the &s;chirro&s;ity of it, belong to the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;en&s;itive motions, and will be treated of hereafter.</P>
<P N="6">6. The ancients are &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an art of increa&s;ing the livers of gee&s;e to a &s;ize greater than the remainder of the goo&s;e. Martial. l. 13. epig. 58.&mdash;This is &s;aid to have been done by fat and figs. Horace, l. 2. &s;at. 8.&mdash;Juvenal &s;ets the&s;e large livers before an epicure as a great rarity. Sat. 5. l. 114; and Per&s;ius, &s;at. 6. l. 71. Pliny &s;ays the&s;e large goo&s;e-livers were &s;oaked in mulled milk, that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, milk mixed with honey and wine; and adds, "that it is uncertain whether Scipio Metellus, of con&s;ular dignity, or M. Se&s;tius, a Roman knight, was the great di&s;coverer of this excellent di&s;h." A modern traveller, I believe Mr. Brydone, a&s;&s;erts that the art of enlarging the livers of gee&s;e &s;till exi&s;ts in Sicily; and it is to be lamented that he did not import it into his native country, as &s;ome method of affecting the human liver might perhaps have been col|lected from it; be&s;ides the honour he might have acquired in improv|ing our giblet pies.</P>
<P>Our wi&s;er caupones, I am told, know how to fatten their fowls, as well as their gee&s;e, for the London markets, by mixing gin in&s;tead
<PB N="352" REF="366">
of figs and fat with their food; by which they are &s;aid to become &s;leepy, and to fatten apace, and probably acquire enlarged livers; as the &s;wine are a&s;&s;erted to do, which are fed on the &s;ediments of barrels in the di&s;tilleries; and which &s;o frequently obtains in tho&s;e, who in|gurgitate much ale, or wine, or drams.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The irritative di&s;ea&s;es of the kidneys, pancreas, &s;pleen, and other glands, are analogous to tho&s;e of the liver above de&s;cribed, differing only in the con&s;equences attending their inability to action. For in&s;tance, when the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys become di&s;|obedient to the &s;timulus of the pa&s;&s;ing current of blood, no urine is &s;eparated or produced by them; their excretory mouths become filled with concreted mucus, or calculus matter, and in eight or ten days &s;tupor and death &s;upervenes in con&s;equence of the retention of the feculent part of the blood.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e in a &s;lighter degree, or when only a part of the kidney is affected, is &s;ucceeded by partial inflammation of the kidney in con|&s;equence of previous torpor. In that ca&s;e greater actions of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els occur, and the nucleus of gravel is formed by the in|flamed mucous membranes of the tubuli uriniferi, as farther explained in its place.</P>
<P>This torpor, or paraly&s;is of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys, like that of the liver, owes its origin to their being previou&s;ly habi|bituated to too great &s;timulus; which in this country is generally owing to the alcohol contained in ale or wine; and hence mu&s;t be regi&s;tered among&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es owing to inebriety; though it may be cau&s;ed by whatever occa&s;ionally inflames the kidney; as too violent riding on hor&s;eback, or the cold from a damp bed, or by &s;leeping on the cold ground; or perhaps by drinking in general too little aqueous fluids.</P>

<P>III. I &s;hall conclude this &s;ection on the di&s;ea&s;es of the liver induced by &s;pirituous liquors, with the well-known &s;tory of Prometheus, which &s;eems indeed to have been invented by phy&s;icians in tho&s;e
<PB N="353" REF="367">
ancient times, when all things were clothed in hieroglyphic, or in fable. Prometheus was painted as &s;tealing fire from heaven, which might well repre&s;ent the inflammable &s;pirit produced by fermentation; which may be &s;aid to animate or enliven the man of clay: whence the conque&s;ts of Bacchus, as well as the temporary mirth and noi&s;e of his devotees. But the after puni&s;hment of tho&s;e, who &s;teal this ac|cur&s;ed fire, is a vulture gnawing the liver; and well allegori&s;es the poor inebriate lingering for years under painful hepatic di&s;|ea&s;es. When the expediency of laying a further tax on the di&s;tilla|tion of &s;pirituous liquors from grain was canva&s;&s;ed before the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ome years ago, it was &s;aid of the di&s;tillers, with great truth, "<HI>They take the bread from the people, and convert it into poi&s;on!</HI>" Yet is this manufactory of di&s;ea&s;e permitted to continue, as appears by its paying into the trea&s;ury above 900,000l. near a million of money annually. And thus, under the names of rum, brandy, gin, whi&s;ky, u&s;quebaugh, wine, cyder, beer, and porter, alcohol is become the bane of the Chri&s;tian world, as opium of the Mahometan.</P>

<HEAD>OF TEMPERAMENTS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>I. The temperament of decrea&s;ed irritability known by weak pul&s;e, large pupils of the eyes, cold extremities. Are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be too irritable. Bear pain better than labour. Natives of North-America contra&s;ted with tho&s;e upon the coa&s;t of Africa. Narrow and broad-&s;houldered people. Irritable con&s;titutions bear labour better than pain. II. Temperament of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility. Liable to intoxication, to inflammation, haemontoe, gutta &s;erena, enthu&s;ia&s;m, delirium, reverie. The&s;e con&s;titutions are indolent to voluntary exertions, and dull to irri|tations. The natives of South-America, and brute animals of this temperament. III. Of increa&s;ed voluntarity; the&s;e are &s;ubject to locked jaw, convul&s;ions, epilep&s;y, mania. Are very active, bear cold, hunger, fatigue. Are &s;uited to great exer|tions. This temperament di&s;tingui&s;hes mankind from other animals. IV. Of increa&s;ed a&s;&s;ociation. The&s;e have great memories, are liable to quartan agues, and &s;tronger &s;ympathies of parts with each other. V. Change of temperaments into one another.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ANTIENT writers have &s;poken much of temperaments, but without &s;ufficient preci&s;ion. By temperament of the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be meant a permanent predi&s;po&s;ition to certain cla&s;&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es: without this definition a temporary predi&s;po&s;ition to every di&s;tinct malady might be termed a temperament. There are four kinds of con&s;titution, which permanently deviate from good health, and are perhaps &s;ufficiently marked to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, and con&s;titute the temperaments or predi&s;po&s;itions to the irritative, &s;en&s;i|tive, voluntary, and a&s;&s;ociate cla&s;&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>I. The Temperament of decrea&s;ed Irritability.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es, which are cau&s;ed by irritation, mo&s;t frequently ori|ginate from the defect of it; for tho&s;e, which are immediately owing to the exce&s;s of it, as the hot fits of fever, are generally occa&s;ioned by an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in con&s;equence of a previous defect of irritation, as in the preceding cold fits of fever. Whereas the di&s;ea&s;es, which are cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation and volition, mo&s;t fre|quently originate from the exce&s;s of tho&s;e &s;en&s;orial powers, as will be explained below.</P>
<P>The temperament of decrea&s;ed irritability appears from the follow|ing circum&s;tances, which &s;hew that the mu&s;cular fibres or organs of &s;en&s;e are liable to become torpid or quie&s;cent from le&s;s defect of &s;ti|mulation than is productive of torpor or quie&s;cence in other con|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>1. The fir&s;t is the weak pul&s;e, which in &s;ome con&s;titutions is at the &s;ame time quick. 2. The next mo&s;t marked criterion of this tem|perament is the largene&s;s of the aperture of the iris, or pupil of the eye, which has been reckoned by &s;ome a beautiful feature in the fe|male countenance, as an indication of delicacy, but to an experienced ob&s;erver it is an indication of debility, and is therefore a defect, not an excellence. The third mo&s;t marked circum&s;tance in this con&s;ti|tution is, that the extremities, as the hands and feet, or no&s;e and ears, are liable to become cold and pale in &s;ituations in re&s;pect to warmth, where tho&s;e of greater &s;trength are not affected. Tho&s;e of this temperament are &s;ubject to hy&s;teric affections, nervous fevers, hydrocephalus, &s;crophula, and con&s;umption, and to all other di&s;ea&s;es of debility.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;s this kind of con&s;titution, are popularly &s;up|po&s;ed to be more irritable than is natural, but are in reality le&s;s &s;o.
<PB N="356" REF="370">
This mi&s;take has ari&s;en from their generally having a greater quick|ne&s;s of pul&s;e, as explained in Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 3.; but this fre|quency of pul&s;e is not nece&s;&s;ary to the temperament, like the debility of it.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of this temperament are frequently found among&s;t the &s;ofter &s;ex, and among&s;t narrow-&s;houldered men; who are &s;aid to bear labour wor&s;e, and pain better than others. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is &s;uppo&s;ed to have prevented the natives of North America from hav|ing been made &s;laves of by the Europeans. They are a narrow|&s;houldered race of people, and will rather expire under the la&s;h, than be made to labour. Some nations of A&s;ia have &s;mall hands, as may be &s;een by the handles of their &s;cymetars; which with their narrow &s;houlders &s;hew, that they have not been accu&s;tomed to &s;o great la|bour with their hands and arms, as the European nations in agricul|ture, and tho&s;e on the coa&s;ts of Africa in &s;wimming and rowing. Dr. Maningham, a popular accoucheur in the beginning of this century, ob&s;erves in his aphori&s;ms, that broad-&s;houldered men pro|create broad-&s;houldered children. Now as labour &s;trengthens the mu&s;cles employed, and increa&s;es their bulk, it would &s;eem that a few generations of labour or of indolence may in this re&s;pect change the form and temperament of the body.</P>
<P>On the contrary, tho&s;e who are happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great degree of irritability, bear labour better than pain; and are &s;trong, active, and ingenious. But there is not properly a temperament of in|crea&s;ed irritability tending to di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e an increa&s;ed quantity of irritative motions generally induces an increa&s;e of plea&s;ure or pain, as in intoxication, or inflammation; and then the new motions are the immediate con&s;equences of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation, not of increa&s;ed irritation; which have hence been &s;o perpetually confounded with each other.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="357" REF="371">
<HEAD>II. Temperament of Sen&s;ibility.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not properly a temperament, or predi&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;e, from decrea&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility, &s;ince irritability and not &s;en&s;ibility is im|mediately nece&s;&s;ary to bodily health. Hence it is the exce&s;s of &s;en|&s;ation alone, as it is the defect of irritation, that mo&s;t frequently pro|duces di&s;ea&s;e. This temperament of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility is known from the increa&s;ed activity of all tho&s;e motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e and mu&s;cles, which are exerted in con&s;equence of plea&s;ure or pain, as in the beginning of drunkenne&s;s, and in inflammatory fever. Hence tho&s;e of this con&s;titution are liable to inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, as hepa|titis; and to that kind of con&s;umption which is hereditary, and com|mences with &s;light repeated hoemoptoe. They have high-coloured lips, frequently dark hair and dark eyes with large pupils, and are in that ca&s;e &s;ubject to gutta &s;erena. They are liable to enthu&s;ia&s;m, de|lirium, and reverie. In this la&s;t circum&s;tance they are liable to &s;tart at the clapping of a door; becau&s;e the more intent any one is on the pa&s;&s;ing current of his ideas, the greater &s;urpri&s;e he experiences on their being di&s;&s;evered by &s;ome external violence, as explained in Sect. XIX. on reverie.</P>
<P>As in the&s;e con&s;titutions more than the natural quantities of &s;en|&s;itive motions are produced by the increa&s;ed quantity of &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ting in the habit, it follows, that the irritative motions will be performed in &s;ome degree with le&s;s energy, owing to the great ex|penditure of &s;en&s;orial power on the &s;en&s;itive ones. Hence tho&s;e of this temperament do not attend to &s;light &s;timulations, as explained in Sect. XIX. But when a &s;timulus is &s;o great as to excite &s;en&s;ation, it produces greater &s;en&s;itive actions of the &s;y&s;tem than in others; &s;uch as dehrium or inflammation. Hence they are liable to be ab&s;ent in company; fit or lie long in one po&s;ture; and in winter have the &s;kin
<PB N="358" REF="372">
of their legs burnt into various colours by the fire. Hence al&s;o they are fearful of pain; covet mu&s;ic and &s;leep; and delight in poetry and romance.</P>
<P>As the motions in con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ation are more than natural, it al&s;o happens from the greater expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power on them, that the voluntary motions are le&s;s ea&s;ily exerted. Hence the &s;ubjects of this temperament are indolent in re&s;pect to all voluntary exertions, whether of mind or body.</P>
<P>A race of people of this de&s;cription &s;eems to have been found by the Spaniards in the i&s;lands of America, where they fir&s;t landed, ten of whom are &s;aid not to have con&s;umed more food than one Spaniard, nor to have been capable of more than one tenth of the exertion of a Spaniard.

<HEAD>III. The Temperament of increa&s;ed Voluntarity.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE of this con&s;titution differ from both the la&s;t mentioned in this, that the pain, which gradually &s;ub&s;ides in the fir&s;t, and is pro|ductive of inflammation or delirium in the &s;econd, is in this &s;ucceded by the exertion of the mu&s;cles or ideas, which are mo&s;t frequently connected with volition; and they are thence &s;ubject to locked jaw, convul&s;ions, epilep&s;y, and mania, as explained in Sect. XXXIV. Tho&s;e of this temperament attend to the &s;lighte&s;t irritations or &s;en&s;ations, and immediately exert them&s;elves to obtain or avoid the objects of them; they can at the &s;ame time bear cold and hunger better than others, of which Charles the Twelfth of Sweden was an in&s;tance.

<P>THIS con&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts in the too great facility, with which the fibrous motions acquire habits of a&s;&s;ociation, and by which the&s;e a&s;|&s;ociations become proportionably &s;tronger than in tho&s;e of the other temperaments. Tho&s;e of this temperament are &s;low in voluntary exertions, or in tho&s;e dependent on &s;en&s;ation, or on irritation. Hence great memories have been &s;aid to be attended with le&s;s &s;en&s;e and le&s;s imagination from Ari&s;totle down to the pre&s;ent time; for by the word memory the&s;e writers only under&s;tood the unmeaning repetition of words or numbers in the order they were received, without any vo|luntary efforts of the mind.</P>
<P>In this temperament tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations of motions, which are com|monly termed &s;ympathies, act with greater certainty and energy, as tho&s;e between di&s;turbed vi&s;ion and the inver&s;ion of the motion of the &s;tomach, as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s; and the pains in the &s;houlder from hepatic inflammation. Add to this, that the catenated circles of actions are of greater extent than in the other con&s;titutions. Thus if a &s;trong vo|mit or cathartic be exhibited in this temperament, a &s;maller quantity will produce as great an effect, if it be given &s;ome weeks afterwards; whereas in other temperaments this is only to be expected, if it be exhibited in a few days after the fir&s;t do&s;e. Hence quartan agues are formed in tho&s;e of this temperament, as explained in Section XXXII. on di&s;ea&s;es from irritation, and other intermittents are liable to recur from &s;light cau&s;es many weeks after they have been cured by the bark.</P>

<P>V. The fir&s;t of the&s;e temperaments differs from the &s;tandard of health from defect, and the others from exce&s;s of &s;en&s;orial power; but it &s;ometimes happens that the &s;ame individual, from the changes introduced into his habit by the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, modes or periods of life, or by accidental di&s;ea&s;es, pa&s;&s;es from one of the&s;e temperaments to another. Thus a long u&s;e of too much fermented liquor produces the temperament of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility; great indo|lence and &s;olitude that of decrea&s;ed irritability; and want of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life that of increa&s;ed voluntarity.</P>

<P>I. WHEN the contractile &s;ides of the heart and arteries perform a greater number of pul&s;ations in a given time, and move through a greater area at each pul&s;ation, whether the&s;e motions are occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of the acrimony or quantity of the blood, or by their a&s;&s;ociation with other irritative motions, or by the increa&s;ed irritability

of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, that is, by an increa&s;ed quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, one kind of fever is produced; which may be called Synocha irritativa, or Febris irritativa pul&s;u forti, or irritative fever with &s;trong pul&s;e.</P>
<P>When the contractile &s;ides of the heart and arteries perform a greater number of pul&s;ations in a given time, but move through a much le&s;s area at each pul&s;ation, whether the&s;e motions are occa&s;ioned by defect of their natural &s;timuli, or by the defect of other irritative motions with which they are a&s;&s;ociated, or from the inirritability of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, that is, from a decrea&s;ed quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, another kind of fever ari&s;es; which may be termed, Typhus irritativus, or Febris irritativa pul&s;u debili, or irritative fever with weak pul&s;e. The former of the&s;e fevers is the &s;ynocha of no&s;ologi&s;ts, and the latter the typhus mitior, or nervous fever. In the former there appears to be an increa&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power, in the latter a deficiency of it; which is &s;hewn to be the immediate cau&s;e of &s;trength and weakne&s;s, as defined in Sect. XII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be added, that a temporary quantity of &s;trength or debility may be induced by the defect or exce&s;s of &s;timulus above what is natural; and that in the &s;ame fever <HI>debility always exi&s;ts during the cold fit, though &s;trength does not always exi&s;t during the hot fit.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e fevers are always connected with, and generally induced by, the di&s;ordered irritative motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, or of the in|te&s;tinal canal, or of the glandular &s;y&s;tem, or of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem; and hence are always complicated with &s;ome or many of the&s;e di&s;|ordered motions, which are termed the &s;ymptoms of the fever, and which compo&s;e the great variety in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<PB N="363" REF="377">
<P>II. For the better illu&s;tration of the phenomena of irritative fevers we mu&s;t refer the reader to the circum&s;tances of irritation ex|plained in Sect. XII. and &s;hall commence this intricate &s;ubject by &s;peaking of the quick pul&s;e, and proceed by con&s;idering many of the cau&s;es, which either &s;eparately or in combination mo&s;t frequently produce the cold fits of fevers.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the arteries are dilated but to half their u&s;ual diameters, though they contract twice as frequently in a given time, they will circulate only half their u&s;ual quantity of blood; for as they are cy|linders, the blood which they contain mu&s;t be as the &s;quares of their diameters. Hence when the pul&s;e becomes quicker and &s;maller in the &s;ame proportion, the heart and arteries act with le&s;s energy than in their natural &s;tate. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.</P>
<P>That this quick &s;mall pul&s;e is owing to want of irritability, ap|pears, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it attends other &s;ymptoms of want of irritability; and, &s;econdly, becau&s;e on the application of a &s;timulus greater than u&s;ual, it becomes &s;lower and larger. Thus in cold fits of agues, in hy&s;teric palpitations of the heart, and when the body is much ex|hau&s;ted by haemorrhages, or by fatigue, as well as in nervous fevers, the pul&s;e becomes quick and &s;mall; and &s;econdly, in all tho&s;e ca&s;es if an increa&s;e of &s;timulus be added, by giving a little wine or opium; the quick &s;mall pul&s;e becomes &s;lower and larger, as any one may ea&s;ily experience on him&s;elf, by counting his pul&s;e after drinking one or two gla&s;&s;es of wine, when he is faint from hunger or fatigue.</P>
<P>Now nothing can &s;o &s;trongly evince that this quick &s;mall pul&s;e is owing to defect of irritability, than that an additional &s;timulus, above what is natural, makes it become &s;lower and larger immediately: for what is meant by a defect of irritability, but that the arteries and heart are not excited into their u&s;ual exertions by their u&s;ual quantity of &s;timulus? but if you increa&s;e the quantity of &s;timulus, and they immediately act with their u&s;ual energy, this proves their previous want of their natural degree of irritability. Thus the trembling
<PB N="364" REF="378">
hands of drunkards in a morning become &s;teady, and acquire &s;trength to perform their u&s;ual offices, by the accu&s;tomed &s;timulus of a gla&s;s or two of brandy.</P>
<P N="2">2. In &s;leep and in apoplexy the pul&s;e becomes &s;lower, which is not owing to defect of irritability, for it is at the &s;ame time larger; and thence the quantity of the circulation is rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed. In the&s;e ca&s;es the organs of &s;en&s;e are clo&s;ed, and the voluntary power is &s;u&s;pended, while the motions dependent on internal irritations, as tho&s;e of dige&s;tion and &s;ecretion, are carried on with more than their u&s;ual vigour; which has led &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers to confound the&s;e ca&s;es with tho&s;e ari&s;ing from want of irritability. Thus if you lift up the eyelid of an apoplectic patient, who is not actually dying, the iris will, as u&s;ual, contract it&s;elf, as this motion is a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;timulus of light; but it is not &s;o in the la&s;t &s;tages of nervous fevers, where the pupil of the eye continues expanded in the broad day-light: in the former ca&s;e there is a want of voluntary power, in the latter a want of irritability.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o tho&s;e con&s;titutions which are deficient in quantity of irritability, and which po&s;&s;e&s;s too great &s;en&s;ibility, as during the pain of hunger, of hy&s;teric &s;pa&s;ms, or nervous headachs, are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have too much irritability; and opium, which in its due do&s;e is a mo&s;t powerful &s;timulant, is erroneou&s;ly called a &s;edative; becau&s;e by increa&s;ing the irritative motions it decrea&s;es the pains ari&s;ing from defect of them.</P>
<P>Why the pul&s;e &s;hould become quicker both from an increa&s;e of irritation, as in the &s;ynocha irritativa, or irritative fever with &s;trong pul&s;e; and from the decrea&s;e of it, as in the typhus irritativus, or irri|tative fever with weak pul&s;e; &s;eems paradoxical. The former cir|cum&s;tance needs no illu&s;tration; &s;ince if the &s;timulus of the blood, or the irritability of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem be increa&s;ed, and the &s;trength of the patient not dimini&s;hed, it is plain that the motions mu&s;t be performed quicker and &s;tronger.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="379">
In the latter circum&s;tance the weakne&s;s of the mu&s;cular power of the heart is &s;oon over-balanced by the ela&s;ticity of the coats of the ar|teries, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s be&s;ides a mu&s;cular power of contraction; and hence the arteries are di&s;tended to le&s;s than their u&s;ual diameters. The heart being thus &s;topped when it is but half emptied, begins &s;ooner to dilate again; and the arteries being dilated to le&s;s than their u&s;ual diameters, begin &s;o much &s;ooner to contract them&s;elves; in&s;o|much, that in the la&s;t &s;tages of fevers with weakne&s;s the frequency of pul&s;ation of the heart and arteries becomes doubled; which, however, is never the ca&s;e in fevers with &s;trength, in which they &s;eldom ex|ceed 118 or 120 pul&s;ations in a minute. It mu&s;t be added, that in the&s;e ca&s;es, while the pul&s;e is very &s;mall and very quick, the heart often feels large, and labouring to one's hand; which coincides with the above explanation, &s;hewing that it does not completely empty it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">3. In ca&s;es however of debility from paucity of blood, as in ani|mals which are bleeding to death in the &s;laughter-hou&s;e, the quick pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries may be owing to their not being di&s;tended to more than half their u&s;ual dia&s;tole; and in con&s;equence they mu&s;t contract &s;ooner, or more frequently, in a given time. As weak people are liable to a deficient quantity of blood, this cau&s;e may occa&s;ionally contribute to quicken the pul&s;e in fevers with debility, which may be known by applying one's hand upon the heart as above; but the principal cau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e to con&s;i&s;t in the diminution of &s;en&s;orial power. When a mu&s;cle contains, or is &s;upplied with but little &s;en&s;orial power, its contraction &s;oon cea&s;es, and in con&s;e|quence may &s;oon recur, as is &s;een in the trembling hands of people weakened by age or by drunkenne&s;s. See Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 4.</P>
<P>It may neverthele&s;s frequently happen, that both the deficiency of &s;timulus, as where the quantity of blood is le&s;&s;ened (as de&s;cribed in No. 4. of this &s;ection), and the deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, as in
<PB N="366" REF="380">
tho&s;e of the temperament of inirritability, de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXI. occur at the &s;ame time; which will thus add to the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e and to the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P N="1">III. 1. A certain degree of heat is nece&s;&s;ary to mu&s;cular motion, and is, in con&s;equence, e&s;&s;ential to life. This is ob&s;erved in tho&s;e ani|mals and in&s;ects which pa&s;s the cold &s;ea&s;on in a torpid &s;tate, and which revive on being warmed by the fire. This nece&s;&s;ary &s;timulus of heat has two &s;ources; one from the fluid atmo&s;phere of heat, in which all things are immer&s;ed, and the other from the internal combinations of the particles, which form the various fluids, which are produced in the exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of the glands. When either the external heat, which &s;urrounds us, or the internal production of it, becomes le&s;&s;ened to a certain degree, the pain of cold is perceived.</P>
<P>This pain of cold is experienced mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly by our teeth, when ice is held in the mouth; or by our whole &s;y&s;tem after having been previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to much warmth. It is probable, that this pain does not ari&s;e from the mechanical or chemical effects of a defi|ciency of heat; but that, like the organs of &s;en&s;e by which we per|ceive hunger and thir&s;t, this &s;en&s;e of heat &s;uffers pain, when the &s;timu|lus of its object is wanting to excite the irritative motions of the or|gan; that is, when the &s;en&s;orial power becomes too much accumu|lated in the quie&s;cent fibres. See Sect. XII. 5. 3. For as the pe|ri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach are le&s;&s;ened, when the pain of hunger is great, &s;o the action of the cutaneous capillaries are le&s;&s;ened during the pain of cold; as appears by the palene&s;s of the &s;kin, as explained in Sect. XIV. 6. on the production of ideas.</P>
<P>The pain in the &s;mall of the back and forehead in the cold &s;its of the ague, in nervous hemicrania, and in hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms, when all the irritative motions are much impaired, &s;eems to ari&s;e from this cau&s;e; the ve&s;&s;els of the&s;e membranes or mu&s;cles become torpid by their irritative a&s;&s;ociations with other parts of the body, and thence
<PB N="367" REF="381">
produce le&s;s of their accu&s;tomed &s;ecretions, and in con&s;equence le&s;s heat is evolved, and they experience the pain of cold; which cold|ne&s;s may often be felt by the hand applied upon the affected part.</P>
<P N="2">2. The importance of a greater or le&s;s deduction of heat from the &s;y&s;tem will be more ea&s;y to comprehend, if we fir&s;t con&s;ider the great expen&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power u&s;ed in carrying on the vital motions; that is, which circulates, ab&s;orbs, &s;ecretes, aerates, and elaborates the whole ma&s;s of fluids with uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity. The &s;en&s;orial power, or &s;pirit of animation, u&s;ed in giving perpetual and &s;trong motion to the heart, which overcomes the ela&s;ticity and vis inertiae of the whole arterial &s;y&s;tem; next the expen&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power in moving with great force and velocity the innumerable trunks and ramifications of the arterial &s;y&s;tem; the expen&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power in circulating the whole ma&s;s of blood through the long and intricate intortions of the very fine ve&s;&s;els, which compo&s;e the glands and capillaries; then the expen&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power in the exertions of the ab&s;orbent extremi|ties of all the lacteals, and of all the lymphatics, which open their mouths on the external &s;urface of the &s;kin, and on the internal &s;ur|faces of every cell or inter&s;tice of the body; then the expen&s;e of &s;en|&s;orial power in the venous ab&s;orption, by which the blood is received from the capillary ve&s;&s;els, or glands, where the arterial power cea&s;es, and is drank up, and returned to the heart; next the expen&s;e of &s;en|&s;orial power u&s;ed by the mu&s;cles of re&s;piration in their office of perpetu|ally expanding the bronchia, or air-ve&s;&s;els, of the lungs; and la&s;tly in the uncea&s;ing peri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach and whole &s;y&s;tem of inte&s;tines, and in all the &s;ecretions of bile, ga&s;tric juice, mucus, per|&s;pirable matter, and the various excretions from the &s;y&s;tem. If we con&s;ider the cea&s;ele&s;s expen&s;e of &s;en&s;orial power thus perpetually em|ployed, it will appear to be much greater in a day than all the volun|tary exertions of our mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e con&s;ume in a week; and all this without any &s;en&s;ible fatigue! Now, if but a part of the&s;e vital motions are impeded, or totally &s;topped for but a &s;hort time, we
<PB N="368" REF="382">
gain an idea, that there mu&s;t be a great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power; as its production in the&s;e organs, which are &s;ubject to perpe|tual activity, is continued during their quie&s;cence, and is in con&s;e|quence accumulated.</P>
<P>While, on the contrary, where tho&s;e vital organs act too forcibly by increa&s;e of &s;timulus without a proportionally-increa&s;ed production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain, it is evident, that a great deficiency of action, that is torpor, mu&s;t &s;oon follow, as in fevers; whereas the locomotive mu&s;cles, which act only by intervals, are neither liable to &s;o great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during their times of inacti|vity, nor to &s;o great an exhau&s;tion of it during their times of action.</P>
<P>Thus, on going into a very cold bath, &s;uppo&s;e at 33 degrees of heat on Fahrenheit's &s;cale, the action of the &s;ubcutaneous capillaries, or glands, and of the mouths of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents is dimini&s;hed, or cea&s;es for a time. Hence le&s;s or no blood pa&s;&s;es the&s;e capillaries, and palene&s;s &s;ucceeds. But &s;oon after emerging from the bath, a more florid colour and a greater degree of heat is generated on the &s;kin than was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before immer&s;ion; for the capillary glands, after this quie&s;cent &s;tate, occa&s;ioned by the want of &s;timulus, become more irritable than u&s;ual to their natural &s;timuli, owing to the accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power, and hence a greater quantity of blood is tran&s;mitted through them, and a greater &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable mat|ter; and, in con&s;equence, a greater degree of heat &s;ucceeds. During the continuance in cold water the breath is cold, and the act of re|&s;piration quick and laborious; which have generally been a&s;cribed to the ob&s;truction of the circulating fluid by a &s;pa&s;m of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and by a con&s;equent accumulation of blood in the lungs, oc|ca&s;ioned by the pre&s;&s;ure as well as by the coldne&s;s of the water. This is not a &s;atisfactory account of this curious phaenomenon, &s;ince at this time the whole circulation is le&s;s, as appears from the &s;mallne&s;s of the pul&s;e and coldne&s;s of the breath; which &s;hew that le&s;s blood pa&s;&s;es through the lungs in a given time; the &s;ame laborious breathing
<PB N="369" REF="383">
immediately occurs when the palene&s;s of the &s;kin is produced by fear, where no external cold or pre&s;&s;ure are applied.</P>
<P>The minute ve&s;&s;els of the bronchia, through which the blood pa&s;&s;es from the arterial to the venal &s;y&s;tem, and which corre&s;pond with the cutaneous capillaries, have frequently been expo&s;ed to cold air, and become quie&s;cent along with tho&s;e of the &s;kin; and hence their mo|tions are &s;o a&s;&s;ociated together, that when one is affected either with quie&s;cence or exertion, the other &s;ympathizes with it, according to the laws of irritative a&s;&s;ociation. See Sect. XXVII. 1. on haemor|rhages.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the quie&s;cence of the minute ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, there are many other &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els which become torpid from their irrita|tive a&s;&s;ociations with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, as the ab&s;orbents of the blad|der and inte&s;tines; whence an evacuation of pale urine occurs, when the naked &s;kin is expo&s;ed only to the coldne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere; and &s;prinkling the naked body with cold water is known to remove even pertinacious con&s;tipation of the bowels. From the quie&s;cence of &s;uch exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els as the glands and capillaries of the &s;kin, and the minute ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, with their various ab&s;orb|ent &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els, a great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial powers is occa|&s;ioned; part of which is again expended in the increa&s;ed exertion of all the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, with an univer&s;al glow of heat in con&s;equence of this exertion, and the remainder of it adds vigour to both the vital and voluntary exertions of the whole day.</P>
<P>If the activity of the &s;ubcutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and of tho&s;e with which their actions are a&s;&s;ociated, was too great before cold immer&s;ion, as in the hot days of &s;ummer, and by that means the &s;en&s;orial power was previ|ou&s;ly dimini&s;hed, we &s;ee the cau&s;e why the cold bath gives &s;uch pre&s;ent &s;trength; namely, by &s;topping the unnece&s;&s;ary activity of the &s;ubcu|taneous ve&s;&s;els, and thus preventing the too great exhau&s;tion of &s;en|&s;orial power; which, in metaphorical language, has been called <HI>bracing</HI> the &s;y&s;tem: which is, however, a mechanical term, only applicable
<PB N="370" REF="384">
to drums, or mu&s;ical &s;trings: as on the contrary the word <HI>relaxa|tion,</HI> when applied to living animal bodies, can only mean too &s;mall a quantity of &s;timulus, or too &s;mall a quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; as explained in Sect. XII. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. This experiment of cold bathing pre&s;ents us with a &s;imple fe|ver-fit; for the pul&s;e is weak, &s;mall, and quick during the cold im|mer&s;ion; and becomes &s;trong, full, and quick during the &s;ub&s;equent glow of heat; till in a few minutes the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;ub&s;ide, and the temporary fever cea&s;es.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e con&s;titutions where the degree of inirritability, or of debi|lity, is greater than natural, the coldne&s;s and palene&s;s of the &s;kin with the quick and weak pul&s;e continue a long time after the patient leaves the bath; and the &s;ub&s;equent heat approaches by unequal flu&s;hings, and he feels him&s;elf di&s;ordered for many hours. Hence the bathing in a cold &s;pring of water, where the heat is but forty-eight degrees on Fahrenheit's thermometer, much di&s;agrees with tho&s;e of weak or inirri|table habits of body; who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o little &s;en&s;orial power, that they cannot without injury bear to have it dimini&s;hed even for a &s;hort time; but who can neverthele&s;s bear the more temperate coldne&s;s of Buxton bath, which is about eighty degrees of heat, and which &s;trengthens them, and makes them by habit le&s;s liable to great quie&s;|cence from &s;mall variations of cold, and thence le&s;s liable to be di&s;or|dered by the unavoidable accidents of life. Hence it appears, why people of the&s;e inirritable con&s;titutions, which is another expre&s;&s;ion for &s;en&s;orial deficiency, are often much injured by bathing in a cold &s;pring of water; and why they &s;hould continue but a very &s;hort time in baths, which are colder than their bodies; and &s;hould gradually in|crea&s;e both the degree of coldne&s;s of the water, and the time of their continuance in it, if they would obtain &s;alutary effects from cold im|mer&s;ions. See Sect. XII. 2. 1.</P>
<P>On the other hand in all ca&s;es where the heat of the external &s;ur|face of the body, or of the internal &s;urface of the lungs, is greater than
<PB N="371" REF="385">
natural, the u&s;e of expo&s;ure to cool air may be deduced. In fever|fits attended with &s;trength, that is with great quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, it removes the additional &s;timulus of heat from the &s;urfaces above mentioned, and thus prevents their exce&s;s of u&s;ele&s;s motion; and in fever-fits attended with debility, that is with a deficiency of the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, it prevents the great and dangerous wa&s;te of &s;en&s;orial power expended in the unnece&s;&s;ary increa&s;e of the actions of the glands and capillaries of the &s;kin and lungs.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the &s;ame manner, when any one is long expo&s;ed to very cold air, a quie&s;cence is produced of the cutaneous and pulmonary ca|pillaries and ab&s;orbents, owing to the deficiency of their u&s;ual &s;timu|lus of heat; and this quie&s;cence of &s;o great a quantity of ve&s;&s;els af|fects, by irritative a&s;&s;ociation, the whole ab&s;orbent and glandular &s;y&s;|tem, which becomes in a greater or le&s;s degree quie&s;cent, and a cold fit of fever is produced.</P>
<P>If the deficiency of the &s;timulus of heat is very great, the quie&s;|cence becomes &s;o general as to extingui&s;h life, as in tho&s;e who are fro|zen to death.</P>
<P>If the deficiency of heat be in le&s;s degree, but yet &s;o great as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to di&s;order the &s;y&s;tem, and &s;hould occur the &s;ucceeding day, it will induce a greater degree of quie&s;cence than before, from its acting in concurrence with the period of the diurnal circle of ac|tions, explained in Sect. XXXVI. Hence from a &s;mall beginning a greater and greater degree of quie&s;cence may be induced, till a com|plete fever-fit is formed; and which will continue to recur at the pe|riods by which it was produced. See Sect. XVII. 3. 6.</P>
<P>If the degree of quie&s;cence occa&s;ioned by defect of the &s;timulus of heat be very great, it will recur a &s;econd time by a &s;lighter cau&s;e, than that which fir&s;t induced it. If the cau&s;e, which induces the &s;econd fit of quie&s;cence, recurs the &s;ucceeding day, the quotidian fever is pro|duced; if not till the alternate day, the tertian fever; and if not till after &s;eventy-two hours from the fir&s;t fit of quie&s;cence, the quartan
<PB N="372" REF="386">
fever is formed. This la&s;t kind of fever recurs le&s;s frequently than the other, as it is a di&s;ea&s;e only of tho&s;e of the temperament of a&s;&s;oci|ability, as mentioned in Sect. XXXI.; for in other con&s;titutions the capability of forming a habit cea&s;es, before the new cau&s;e of quie&s;cence is again applied, if that does not occur &s;ooner than in &s;eventy-two hours.</P>
<P>And hence tho&s;e fevers, who&s;e cau&s;e is from cold air of the night or morning, are more liable to ob&s;erve the &s;olar day in their periods; while tho&s;e from other cau&s;es frequently ob&s;erve the lunar day in their periods, their paroxy&s;ms returning near an hour later every day, as explained in Sect. XXXVI.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<P>IV. Another frequent cau&s;e of the cold fits of fever is the defect of the &s;timulus of di&s;tention. The whole arterial &s;y&s;tem would appear, by the experiments of Haller, to be irritable by no other &s;timulus, and the motions of the heart and alimentary canal are certainly in &s;ome mea&s;ure dependant on the &s;ame cau&s;e. See Sect. XIV. 7. Hence there can be no wonder, that the diminution of di&s;tention &s;hould fre|quently induce the quie&s;cence, which con&s;titutes the beginning of fe|ver-fits.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Leiutaud has judiciou&s;ly mentioned the deficiency of the quantity of blood among&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, which he &s;ays is fre|quently evident in di&s;&s;ections: fevers are hence brought on by great haemorrhages, diarrhoeas, or other evacuations; or from the continued u&s;e of diet, which contains but little nouri&s;hment; or from the exhau&s;|tion occa&s;ioned by violent fatigue, or by tho&s;e chronic di&s;ea&s;es in which the dige&s;tion is much impaired; as where the &s;tomach has been long affected with the gout or &s;chirrus; or in the paraly&s;is of the liver, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXX. Hence a paroxy&s;m of gout is liable to recur on bleeding or purging; as the torpor of &s;ome vi&s;cus, which precedes the inflammation of the foot, is thus induced by the want of the &s;timulus of di&s;tention. And hence the extremities of the body, as the no&s;e and fingers, are more liable to become cold,
<PB N="373" REF="387">
when we have long ab&s;tained from food; and hence the pul&s;e is in|crea&s;ed both in &s;trength and velocity above the natural &s;tandard after a full meal by the &s;timulus of di&s;tention.</P>
<P>However, this &s;timulus of di&s;tention, like the &s;timulus of heat above de&s;cribed, though it contributes much to the due action not only of the heart, arteries, and alimentary canal, but &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the proper &s;ecretion of all the various glands; yet perhaps it is not the &s;ole cau&s;e of any of the&s;e numerous motions: for as the lacteals, cu|taneous ab&s;orbents, and the various glands appear to be &s;timulated into action by the peculiar pungency of the fluids they ab&s;orb, &s;o in the inte&s;tinal canal the pungency of the dige&s;ting aliment, or the acri|mony of the faeces, &s;eem to contribute, as well as their bulk, to pro|mote the peri&s;taltic motions; and in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, the mo|mentum of the particles of the circulating blood, and their acrimony, &s;timulate the arteries, as well as the di&s;tention occa&s;ioned by it. Where the pul&s;e is &s;mall this defect of di&s;tention is pre&s;ent, and con|tributes much to produce the febris irritativa pul&s;u debili, or irritative fever with weak pul&s;e, called by modern writers nervous fever, as a predi&s;ponent cau&s;e. See Sect. XII. 1. 4. Might not the transfu&s;ion of blood, &s;uppo&s;e of four ounces daily from a &s;trong man, or other healthful animal, as a &s;heep or an a&s;s, be u&s;ed in the early &s;tate of ner|vous or putrid fevers with great pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="subsection">
<P>V. The defect of the momentum of the particles of the circu|lating blood is another cau&s;e of the quie&s;cence, with which the cold fits of fever commence. This &s;timulus of the momentum of the progre&s;&s;ive particles of the blood does not act over the whole body like tho&s;e of heat and di&s;tention above de&s;cribed, but is confined to the arterial &s;y&s;tem; and differs from the &s;timulus of the di&s;tention of the blood, as much as the vibration of the air does from the currents of it. Thus are the different organs of our bodies &s;timulated by four different mechanic properties of the external world: the &s;en&s;e of touch by the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;olid bodies &s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h their figure;
<PB N="374" REF="388">
the mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem by the di&s;tention, which they occa&s;ion; the in|ternal &s;urface of the arteries, by the momentum of their moving par|ticles; and the auditory nerves, by the vibration of them: and the&s;e four mechanic properties are as different from each other as the vari|ous chemical ones, which are adapted to the numerous glands, and to the other organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The momentum of the progre&s;&s;ive particles of blood is com|pounded of their velocity and their quantity of matter: hence what|ever circum&s;tances dimini&s;h either of the&s;e without proportionally in|crea&s;ing the other, and without &s;uperadding either of the general &s;ti|muli of heat or di&s;tention, will tend to produce a quie&s;cence of the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem, and from thence of all the other irritative motions, which are connected with it.</P>
<P>Hence in all tho&s;e con&s;titutions or di&s;ea&s;es where the blood con|tains a greater proportion of &s;erum, which is the lighte&s;t part of its compo&s;ition, the pul&s;ations of the arteries are weaker, as in nervous fevers, chloro&s;is, and hy&s;teric complaints; for in the&s;e ca&s;es the mo|mentum of the progre&s;&s;ive particles of blood is le&s;s: and hence, where the den&s;er parts of its compo&s;ition abound, as the red part of it, or the coagulable lymph, the arterial pul&s;ations are &s;tronger; as in tho&s;e of robu&s;t health, and in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>That this &s;timulus of the momentum of the particles of the circu|lating fluid is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the arterial action, appears from the experiment of injecting air into the blood ve&s;&s;els, which &s;eems to de&s;troy animal life from the want of this &s;timulus of momentum; for the di&s;tention of the arteries is not dimini&s;hed by it, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no corro&s;ive acrimony, and is le&s;s liable to repa&s;s the valves than the blood it&s;elf; &s;ince air-valves in all machinery require much le&s;s accuracy of con&s;truction than tho&s;e which are oppo&s;ed to water.</P>
<P N="3">3. One method of increa&s;ing the velocity of the blood, and in con|&s;equence the momentum of its particles, is by the exerci&s;e of the body, or by the friction of its &s;urface: &s;o, on the contrary, too great
<PB N="375" REF="389">
indolence contributes to decrea&s;e this &s;timulus of the momentum of the particles of the circulating blood, and thus tends to induce quie&s;|cence; as is &s;een in hy&s;teric ca&s;es, and chloro&s;is, and the other di&s;ea&s;es of &s;edentary people.</P>
<P N="4">4. The velocity of the particles of the blood in certain circum|&s;tances is increa&s;ed by vene&s;ection, which, by removing a part of it, dimini&s;hes the re&s;i&s;tance to the motion of the other part, and hence the momentum of the particles of it is increa&s;ed. This may be ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood by con&s;idering it in the extreme, &s;ince, if the re&s;i&s;tance was greatly increa&s;ed, &s;o as to overcome the propelling power, there could be no velocity, and in con&s;equence no momentum at all. From this circum&s;tance ari&s;es that curious phaenomenon, the truth of which I have been more than once witne&s;s to, that vene&s;ection will often in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly relieve tho&s;e nervous pains, which attend the cold pe|riods of hy&s;teric, a&s;thmatic, or epileptic di&s;ea&s;es; and that even where large do&s;es of opium have been in vain exhibited. In the&s;e ca&s;es the pul&s;e becomes &s;tronger after the bleeding, and the extremities regain their natural warmth; and an opiate then given acts with much more certain effect.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="subsection">
<P>VI. There is another cau&s;e, which &s;eems occa&s;ionally to induce quie&s;cence into &s;ome part of our &s;y&s;tem, I mean the influence of the &s;un and moon; the attraction of the&s;e luminaries, by decrea&s;ing the gravity of the particles of the blood, cannot affect their momentum, as their vis inertiae remains the &s;ame; but it may neverthele&s;s pro|duce &s;ome chemical change in them, becau&s;e whatever affects the ge|neral attractions of the particles of matter may be &s;uppo&s;ed from ana|logy to affect their &s;pecific attractions or affinities: and thus the &s;timu|lus of the particles of blood may be dimini&s;hed, though not their mo|mentum. As the tides of the &s;ea obey the &s;outhing and northing of the moon (allowing for the time nece&s;&s;ary for their motion, and the ob&s;tructions of the &s;hores), it is probable, that there are al&s;o atmo&s;phe|ric tides on both &s;ides of the earth, which to the inhabitants of ano|ther
<PB N="376" REF="390">
planet might &s;o deflect the light as to re&s;emble the ring of Sa|turn. Now as the&s;e tides of water, or of air, are rai&s;ed by the dimi|nution of their gravity, it follows, that their pre&s;&s;ure on the &s;urface of the earth is no greater than the pre&s;&s;ure of the other parts of the ocean, or of the atmo&s;phere, where no &s;uch tides exi&s;t; and there|fore that they cannot affect the mercury in the barometer. In the &s;ame manner, the gravity of all other terre&s;trial bodies is dimini&s;hed at the times of the &s;outhing and northing of the moon, and that in a greater degree when this coincides with the &s;outhing and northing of the &s;un, and this in a &s;till greater degree about the times of the equi|noxes. This decrea&s;e of the gravity of all bodies during the time the moon pa&s;&s;es our zenith or nadir might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;hewn by the &s;lower vibrations of a pendulum, compared with a &s;pring clock, or with a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation. Since a pendulum of a certain length moves &s;lower at the line than near the poles, becau&s;e the gravity be|ing dimini&s;hed and the vis inertiae continuing the &s;ame, the motive power is le&s;s, but the re&s;i&s;tance to be overcome continues the &s;ame. The combined powers of the lunar and &s;olar attraction is e&s;timated by Sir I&s;aac Newton not to exceed one 7,868,850th part of the power of gravitation, which &s;eems indeed but a &s;mall circum&s;tance to produce any con&s;iderable effect on the weight of &s;ublunary bodies, and yet this is &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the tides at the equator above ten feet high; and if it be con&s;idered, what &s;mall impul&s;es of other bodies produce their effects on the organs of &s;en&s;e adapted to the perception of them, as of vibration on the auditory nerves, we &s;hall cea&s;e to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;o minute a diminution in the gravity of the particles of blood &s;hould &s;o far affect their chemical changes, or their &s;timulating quality, as, joined with other cau&s;es, &s;ometimes to produce the beginnings of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if the lunar influence produces a very &s;mall degree of quie&s;cence at fir&s;t, and if that recurs at certain periods even with le&s;s power to produce quie&s;cence than at fir&s;t, yet the quie&s;cence will
<PB N="377" REF="391">
daily increa&s;e by the acquired habit acting at the &s;ame time, till at length &s;o great a degree of quie&s;cence is induced as to produce phren&s;y, canine madne&s;s, epilep&s;y, hy&s;teric pains, or cold fits of fever, in&s;tances of many of which are to be found in Dr. Mead's work on this &s;ubject. The &s;olar influence al&s;o appears daily in &s;everal di&s;|ea&s;es; but as darkne&s;s, &s;ilence, &s;leep, and our periodical meals mark the parts of the &s;olar circle of actions, it is &s;ometimes dubious to which of the&s;e the periodical returns of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are to be a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>As far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, the periods of inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es ob&s;erve the &s;olar day; as the gout and rheumati&s;m have their greate&s;t quie&s;cence about noon and midnight, and their exacerbations &s;ome hours after; as they have more frequently their immediate cau&s;e from cold air, inanition, or fatigue, than from the effects of lunations: whil&s;t the cold fits of hy&s;teric patients, and tho&s;e in nervous fevers, more frequently occur twice a day, later by near half an hour each time, according to the lunar day; whil&s;t &s;ome fits of intermittents, which are undi&s;turbed by medicines, return at regular &s;olar periods, and others at lunar ones; which may, probably, be owing to the dif|ference of the periods of tho&s;e external circum&s;tances of cold, inani|tion, or lunation, which immediately cau&s;ed them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve, that the periods of quie&s;cence and ex|acerbation in di&s;ea&s;es do not always commence at the times of the &s;y|zygies or quadratures of the moon and &s;un, or at the times of their pa&s;&s;ing the zenith or nadir; but as it is probable, that the &s;timulus of the particles of the circumfluent blood is gradually dimini&s;hed from the time of the quadratures to that of the &s;yzygies, the quie&s;cence may commence at any hour, when, co-operating with other cau&s;es of quie&s;cence, it becomes great enough to produce a di&s;ea&s;e: afterwards it will continue to recur at the &s;ame period of the lunar or &s;olar influ|ence; the &s;ame cau&s;e operating conjointly with the acquired habit, that is with the catenation of this new motion with the di&s;&s;evered links of the lunar or &s;olar circles of animal action.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="392">
In this manner the periods of men&s;truation obey the lunar month with great exactne&s;s in healthy patients (and perhaps the vene|real orga&s;m in brute animals does the &s;ame), yet the&s;e periods do not commence either at the &s;yzygies or quadratures of the lunations, but at whatever time of the lunar periods they begin, they ob&s;erve the &s;ame in their returns till &s;ome greater cau&s;e di&s;turbs them.</P>
<P>Hence, though the be&s;t way to calculate the time of the expected returns of the paroxy&s;ms of periodical di&s;ea&s;es is to count the number of hours between the commencement of the two preceding fits, yet the following ob&s;ervations may be worth attending to, when we en|deavour to prevent the returns of maniacal or epileptic di&s;ea&s;es; who&s;e periods (at the beginning of them e&s;pecially) frequently ob&s;erve the &s;yzygies of the moon and &s;un, and particularly about the equinox.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t of the two tides happening in every revolution of the moon, is that when the moon approaches neare&s;t to the zenith or na|dir; for this rea&s;on, while the &s;un is in the northern &s;igns, that is during the vernal and &s;ummer months, the greater of the two diurnal tides in our latitude is that, when the moon is above the horizon; and when the &s;un is in the &s;outhern &s;igns, or during the autumnal and winter months, the greater tide is that, which ari&s;es when the moon is below the horizon: and as the &s;un approaches &s;omewhat nearer the earth in winter than in &s;ummer, the greate&s;t equinoctial tides are ob&s;erved to be a little before the vernal equinox, and a little after the autumnal one.</P>
<P>Do not the cold periods of lunar di&s;ea&s;es commence a few hours be|fore the &s;outhing of the moon during the vernal and &s;ummer months, and before the northing of the moon during the autumnal and winter months? Do not pal&s;ies and apoplexies, which occur about the equi|noxes, happen a few days before the vernal equinoctial lunation, and after the autumnal one? Are not the periods of tho&s;e diurnal di&s;|ea&s;es more ob&s;tinate, that commence many hours before the &s;outhing or northing of the moon, than of tho&s;e which commence at tho&s;e times? Are not tho&s;e pal&s;ies and apoplexies more dangerous which
<PB N="379" REF="393">
commence many days before the &s;yzygies of the moon, than tho&s;e which happen at tho&s;e times? See Sect. XXXVI. on the periods of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="subsection">
<P>VII. Another very frequent cau&s;e of the cold fit of fever is the quie&s;cence of &s;ome of tho&s;e large congeries of glands, which compo&s;e the liver, &s;pleen, or pancreas; one or more of which are frequently &s;o enlarged in the autumnal intermittents as to be perceptible to the touch externally, and are called by the vulgar ague-cakes. As the&s;e glands are &s;timulated into action by the &s;pecific pungency of the fluids, which they ab&s;orb, the general cau&s;e of their quie&s;cence &s;eems to be the too great in&s;ipidity of the fluids of the body, co-operating perhaps at the &s;ame time with other general cau&s;es of quie&s;cence.</P>
<P>Hence, in mar&s;hy countries at cold &s;ea&s;ons, which have &s;ucceeded hot ones, and among&s;t tho&s;e, who have lived on innutritious and un|&s;timulating diet, the&s;e agues are mo&s;t frequent. The enlargement of the&s;e quie&s;cent vi&s;cera, and the &s;welling of the praecordia in many other fevers, is, mo&s;t probably, owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e; which may con&s;i&s;t in a general deficiency of the production of &s;en&s;orial power, as well as in the dimini&s;hed &s;timulation of the fluids; and when the quie&s;cence of &s;o great a number of glands, as con&s;titute one of tho&s;e large vi&s;cera, commences, all the other irritative motions are affected by their connection with it, and the cold fit of fever is produced.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="subsection">
<P>VIII. There are many other cau&s;es, which produce quie&s;cence of &s;ome part of the animal &s;y&s;tem, as fatigue, hunger, thir&s;t, bad diet, di&s;appointed love, unwhole&s;ome air, exhau&s;tion from evacuations, and many others; but the la&s;t cau&s;e, that we &s;hall mention, as frequently productive of cold fits of fever, is fear or anxiety of mind. The pains, which we are fir&s;t and mo&s;t generally acquainted with, have been pro|duced by defect of &s;ome &s;timulus; thus, &s;oon after our nativity we become acquainted with the pain from the coldne&s;s of the air, from the want of re&s;piration, and from the want of food. Now all the&s;e pains occa&s;ioned by defect of &s;timulus are attended with quie&s;cence
<PB N="380" REF="394">
of the organ, and at the &s;ame time with a greater or le&s;s degree of quie&s;cence of other parts of the &s;y&s;tem: thus, if we even endure the pain of hunger &s;o as to mi&s;s one meal in&s;tead of our daily habit of re|pletion, not only the peri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach and bowels are dimini&s;hed, but we are more liable to coldne&s;s of our extremities, as of our no&s;es, and ears, and feet, than at other times.</P>
<P>Now, as fear is originally excited by our having experienced pain, and is it&s;elf a painful affection, the &s;ame quie&s;cence of other fibrous motions accompany it, as have been mo&s;t frequently connected with this kind of pain, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. as the coldne&s;s and palene&s;s of the &s;kin, trembling, difficult re&s;piration, indige&s;tion, and other &s;ymptoms, which contribute to form the cold fit of fevers. Anxiety is fear continued through a longer time, and, by producing chronical torpor of the &s;y&s;tem, extingui&s;hes life &s;lowly, by what is commonly termed a broken heart.</P>

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">IX. 1. We now &s;tep forwards to con&s;ider the other &s;ymptoms in con&s;equence of the quie&s;cence which begins the fits of fever. If by any of the circum&s;tances before de&s;cribed, or by two or more of them acting at the &s;ame time, a great degree of quie&s;cence is in|duced on any con&s;iderable part of the circle of irritative motions, the whole cla&s;s of them is more or le&s;s di&s;turbed by their irritative a&s;&s;ocia|tions. If this torpor be occa&s;ioned by a deficient &s;upply of &s;en&s;orial power, and happens to any of tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which are ac|cu&s;tomed to perpetual activity, as the vital motions, the torpor in|crea&s;es rapidly, becau&s;e of the great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by the ince&s;&s;ant activity of tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as &s;hewn in No. 3. 2. of this Section. Hence a deficiency of all the &s;ecretions &s;ucceeds, and as animal heat is produced in proportion to the quantity of tho&s;e &s;ecre|tions, the coldne&s;s of the &s;kin is the fir&s;t circum&s;tance, which is at|tended to. Dr. Martin a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ome parts of his body were warmer than natural in the cold fit of fever; but it is certain, that tho&s;e, which are uncovered, as the &s;ingers, and no&s;e, and ears, are
<PB N="381" REF="395">
much colder to the touch, and paler in appearance. It is po&s;&s;ible, that his experiments were made at the beginning of the &s;ub&s;equent hot fits; which commence with partial di&s;tributions of heat, owing to &s;ome parts of the body regaining their natural irritability &s;ooner than others.</P>
<P>From the quie&s;cence of the ana&s;tomo&s;ing capillaries a palene&s;s of the &s;kin &s;ucceeds, and a le&s;s &s;ecretion of the per&s;pirable matter; from the quie&s;cence of the pulmonary capillaries a difficulty of re&s;piration ari&s;es; and from the quie&s;cence of the other glands le&s;s bile, le&s;s ga&s;|tric and pancreatic juice, are &s;ecreted into the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, and le&s;s mucus and &s;aliva are poured into the mouth; whence ari&s;es the dry tongue, co&s;tivene&s;s, dry ulcers, and paucity of urine. From the quie&s;cence of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem ari&s;es the great thir&s;t, as le&s;s moi&s;ture is ab&s;orbed from the atmo&s;phere. The ab&s;orption from the atmo&s;phere was ob&s;erved by Dr. Ly&s;ter to amount to eighteen ounces in one night, above what he had at the &s;ame time in&s;en&s;ibly per&s;pired. See Langri&s;h. On the &s;ame account the urine is pale, though in &s;mall quantity, for the thinner part is not ab&s;orbed from it; and when repeated ague-fits continue long, the legs &s;well from the dimini&s;hed ab&s;orption of the cellular ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>From the quie&s;cence of the inte&s;tinal canal a lo&s;s of appetite and flatulencies proceed. From the partial quie&s;cence of the glandular vi&s;cera a &s;welling and ten&s;ion about the praecordia becomes &s;en&s;ible to the touch; which is occa&s;ioned by the delay of the fluids from the defect of venous or lymphatic ab&s;orption. The pain of the forehead, and of the limbs, and of the &s;mall of the back, ari&s;es from the quie&s;|cence of the membranous fa&s;cia, or mu&s;cles of tho&s;e parts, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;kin becomes painful, when the ve&s;&s;els, of which it is compo&s;ed, become quie&s;cent from cold. The trembling in con&s;e|quence of the pain of coldne&s;s, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the yawning, and &s;tretching of the limbs, together with the &s;huddering, or rigours, are
<PB N="382" REF="396">
convul&s;ive motions; and will be explained among&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es of vo|lition, Sect. XXXIV.</P>
<P>Sickne&s;s and vomiting is a frequent &s;ymptom in the beginnings of fever-fits, the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach &s;hare the general torpor and debility of the &s;y&s;tem; their motions become fir&s;t le&s;&s;ened, and then &s;top, and then become retrograde; for the act of vomiting, like the globus hy&s;tericus and the borborigmi of hypocondria&s;is, is always a &s;ymptom of debility, either from want of &s;timulus, as in hunger; or from want of &s;en&s;orial power, as after intoxication; or from &s;ym|pathy with &s;ome other torpid irritative motions, as in the cold fits of ague. See Sect. XII. 5. 5. XXIX. 11. and XXXV. 1. 3. where this act of vomiting is further explained.</P>
<P>The &s;mall pul&s;e, which is &s;aid by &s;ome writers to be &s;low at the commencement of ague-fits, and which is frequently trembling and intermittent, is owing to the quie&s;cence of the heart and arterial &s;y&s;|tem, and to the re&s;i&s;tance oppo&s;ed to the circulating fluid from the inactivity of all the glands and capillaries. The great weakne&s;s and inability to voluntary motions, with the in&s;en&s;ibility of the extremi|ties, are owing to the general quie&s;cence of the whole moving &s;y&s;tem; or, perhaps, &s;imply to the deficient production of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P>If all the&s;e &s;ymptoms are further increa&s;ed, the quie&s;cence of all the mu&s;cles, including the heart and arteries, becomes complete, and death en&s;ues. This is, mo&s;t probably, the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who are &s;tarved to death with cold, and of tho&s;e who are &s;aid to die in Holland from long &s;kaiting on their frozen canals.</P>
<P N="2">2. As &s;oon as this general quie&s;cence of the &s;y&s;tem cea&s;es, either by the diminution of the cau&s;e, or by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, (as in &s;yncope, Sect. XII. 7. 1.) which is the natural con&s;equence of previous quie&s;cence, the hot fit commences. Every gland of the body is now &s;timulated into &s;tronger action than is natural, as its irri|tability is increa&s;ed by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during its late
<PB N="383" REF="397">
quie&s;cence, a &s;uperabundance of all the &s;ecretions is produced, and an increa&s;e of heat in con&s;equence of the increa&s;e of the&s;e &s;ecretions. The &s;kin becomes red, and the per&s;piration great, owing to the in|crea&s;ed action of the capillaries during the hot part of the paroxy&s;m. The &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter is perhaps greater during the hot fit than in the &s;weating fit which follows; but as the ab&s;orption of it al&s;o is greater, it does not &s;tand on the &s;kin in vi&s;ible drops: add to this, that the evaporation of it al&s;o is greater, from the increa&s;ed heat of the &s;kin. But at the decline of the hot fit, as the mouths of the ab|&s;orbents of the &s;kin are expo&s;ed to the cooler air, or bed-clothes, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ooner lo&s;e their increa&s;ed activity, and cea&s;e to ab&s;orb more than their natural quantity: but the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els for &s;ome time longer, being kept warm by the circulating blood, continue to pour out an in|crea&s;ed quantity of per&s;pirable matter, which now &s;tands on the &s;kin in large vi&s;ible drops; the exhalation of it al&s;o being le&s;&s;ened by the greater coolne&s;s of the &s;kin, as well as its ab&s;orption by the dimini&s;hed action of the lymphatics. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 3.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile and of other fluids poured into the inte&s;tines frequently induce a purging at the decline of the hot fit; for as the external ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els have their mouths expo&s;ed to the cold air, as above mentioned, they cea&s;e to be excited into unnatural activity &s;ooner than the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e mouths are expo&s;ed to the warmth of the blood: now, as the internal ab&s;orbents &s;ympa|thize with the external ones, the&s;e al&s;o, which during the hot fit drank up the thinner part of the bile, or of other &s;ecreted fluids, lo&s;e their increa&s;ed activity before the gland lo&s;es its increa&s;ed activity, at the decline of the hot fit; and the loo&s;e dejections are produced from the &s;ame cau&s;e, that the increa&s;ed per&s;piration &s;tands on the &s;ur|face of the &s;kin, from the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption cea&s;ing &s;ooner than the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>The urine during the cold fit is in &s;mall quantity and pale, both from a deficiency of the &s;ecretion and a deficiency of the ab&s;orption.
<PB N="384" REF="398">
During the hot fit it is in its u&s;ual quantity, but very high coloured and turbid, becau&s;e a greater quantity had been &s;ecreted by the in|crea&s;ed action of the kidnies, and al&s;o a greater quantity of its more aqueous part had been ab&s;orbed from it in the bladder by the increa&s;ed action of the ab&s;orbents; and la&s;tly, at the decline of the hot fit it is in large quantity and le&s;s coloured, or turbid, becau&s;e the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the bladder, as ob&s;erved above, lo&s;e their increa&s;ed action by &s;ympathy with the cutaneous ones &s;ooner than the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidnies lo&s;e their increa&s;ed activity. Hence the quantity of the &s;ediment, and the colour of the urine, in fevers, depend much on the quantity &s;ecreted by the kidnies, and the quantity ab&s;orbed from it again in the bladder: the kinds of &s;ediment, as the lateri|tious, purulent, mucous, or bloody &s;ediments, depend on other cau&s;es. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that if the &s;weating be increa&s;ed by the heat of the room, or of the bed-clothes, that a paucity of turbid urine will continue to be produced, as the ab&s;orbents of the bladder will have their activity increa&s;ed by their &s;ympathy with the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the fluid expended in per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e becomes &s;trong and full owing to the increa&s;ed irritabi|lity of the heart and arteries, from the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during their quie&s;cence, and to the quickne&s;s of the return of the blood from the various glands and capillaries. This increa&s;ed ac|tion of all the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els does not occur very &s;uddenly, nor uni|ver&s;ally at the &s;ame time. The heat &s;eems to begin about the center, and to be diffu&s;ed from thence irregularly to the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. This may be owing to the &s;ituation of the parts which fir&s;t became quie&s;cent and cau&s;ed the fever-fit, e&s;pecially when a hardne&s;s or tumour about the praecordia can be felt by the hand; and hence this part, in whatever vi&s;cus it is &s;eated, might be the fir&s;t to regain its natural or increa&s;ed irritability.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="385" REF="399">
3. It mu&s;t be here noted, that, by the increa&s;ed quantity of heat, and of the impul&s;e of the blood at the commencement of the hot &s;it, a great increa&s;e of &s;timulus is induced, and is now added to the in|crea&s;ed irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, which was occa&s;ioned by its previ|ous quie&s;cence. This additional &s;timulus of heat and momentum of the blood augments the violence of the movements of the arterial and glandular &s;y&s;tem in an increa&s;ing ratio. The&s;e violent exertions &s;till producing more heat and greater momentum of the moving fluids, till at length the &s;en&s;orial power becomes wa&s;ted by this great &s;timu|lus beneath its natural quantity, and predi&s;po&s;es the &s;y&s;tem to a &s;e|cond cold fit.</P>
<P>At length all the&s;e unnatural exertions &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;ub&s;ide with the increa&s;ed irritability that produced them; and which was it&s;elf produced by the preceding quie&s;cence, in the &s;ame manner as the eye, on coming from darkne&s;s into day-light, in a little time cea&s;es to be dazzled and pained, and gradually recovers its natural degree of irri|tability.</P>
<P N="4">4. But if the increa&s;e of irritability, and the con&s;equent increa&s;e of the &s;timulus of heat and momentum, produce more violent exer|tions than tho&s;e above de&s;cribed; great pain ari&s;es in &s;ome part of the moving &s;y&s;tem, as in the membranes of the brain, pleura, or joints; and new motions of the ve&s;&s;els are produced in con&s;equence of this pain, which are called inflammation; or delirium or &s;tupor ari&s;es; as explained in Sect. XXI. and XXXIII.: for the immediate effect is the &s;ame, whether the great energy of the moving organs ari&s;es from an increa&s;e of &s;timulus or an increa&s;e of irritability; though in the former ca&s;e the wa&s;te of &s;en&s;orial power leads to debility, and in the latter to health.</P>

<HEAD>Recapitulation.</HEAD>
<P>X. Tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are le&s;s frequently exerted, and who&s;e actions are interrupted by &s;leep, acquire le&s;s accumulation of &s;en&s;o|rial power during their quie&s;cent &s;tate, as the mu&s;cles of locomotion. In the&s;e mu&s;cles after great exertion, that is, after great exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, the pain of fatigue en&s;ues; and during re&s;t there is a renovation of the natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; but where the re&s;t, or quie&s;cence of the mu&s;cle, is long continued, a quantity of &s;en|&s;orial power becomes accumulated beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary; as ap|pears by the unea&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned by want of exerci&s;e; and which in young animals is one cau&s;e exciting them into action, as is &s;een in the play of puppies and kittens.</P>
<P>But when tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are habituated to perpetual action, as tho&s;e of the &s;tomach by the &s;timulus of food, tho&s;e of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin by the &s;timulus of heat, and tho&s;e which con&s;titute the arteries and glands by the &s;timulus of the blood, become for a time quie&s;cent, from the want of their appropriated &s;timuli, or by their a&s;|&s;ociations with other quie&s;cent parts of the &s;y&s;tem; a greater accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power is acquired during their quie&s;cence, and a greater or quicker exhau&s;tion of it is produced during their increa&s;ed action.</P>
<P>This accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power from deficient action, if it happens to the &s;tomach from want of food, occa&s;ions the pain of hun|ger; if it happens to the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin from want of heat, it oc|ca&s;ions the pain of cold; and if to the arterial &s;y&s;tem from the want of its adapted &s;timuli, many di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations are occa&s;ioned, &s;uch as are experienced in the cold &s;its of intermittent fevers, and are
<PB N="387" REF="401">
as various, as there are glands or membranes in the &s;y&s;tem, and are generally termed univer&s;al unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When the quie&s;cence of the arterial &s;y&s;tem is not owing to defect of &s;timulus as above, but to the defective quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, as in the commencement of nervous fever, or irritative fever with weak pul&s;e, a great torpor of this &s;y&s;tem is quickly induced; becau&s;e both the irritation from the &s;timulus of the blood, and the a&s;&s;ociation of the va&s;cular motions with each other, continue to excite the arteries into action, and thence quickly exhau&s;t the ill-&s;upplied va&s;cular mu&s;cles; for to re&s;t is death; and therefore tho&s;e va&s;cular mu&s;cles continue to proceed, though with feebler action, to the extreme of wearine&s;s or faintne&s;s: while nothing &s;imilar to this affects the locomotive mu&s;cles, who&s;e actions are generally cau&s;ed by volition, and not much &s;ubject either to irritation or to other kinds of a&s;&s;ociations be&s;ides the vo|luntary ones, except indeed when they are excited by the la&s;h of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>In the&s;e va&s;cular mu&s;cles, which are &s;ubject to perpetual action, and thence liable to great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during their quie&s;cence from want of &s;timulus, a great increa&s;e of activity occurs, either from the renewal of their accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, or even from much le&s;s quantities of &s;timulus than u&s;ual. This increa&s;e of action con&s;titutes the hot fit of fever, which is attended with various in|crea&s;ed &s;ecretions, with great concomitant heat, and general unea&s;i|ne&s;s. The unea&s;ine&s;s attending this hot paroxy&s;m of fever, or fit of exertion, is very different from that, which attends the previous cold fit, or fit of quie&s;cence, and is frequently the cau&s;e of inflamma|tion, as in pleuri&s;y, which is treated of in the next &s;ection.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar effect occurs after the quie&s;cence of our organs of &s;en&s;e; tho&s;e which are not &s;ubject to perpetual action, as the ta&s;te and &s;mell, are le&s;s liable to an exuberant accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power after their having for a time been inactive; but the eye, which is in per|petual
<PB N="388" REF="402">
action during the day, becomes dazzled, and liable to inflam|mation after a temporary quie&s;cence.</P>
<P>Where the previous quie&s;cence has been owing to a defect of &s;en|&s;orial power, and not to a defect of &s;timulus, as in the irritative fever with weak pul&s;e, a &s;imilar increa&s;e of activity of the arterial &s;y&s;tem &s;ucceeds, either from the u&s;ual &s;timulus of the blood, or from a &s;ti|mulus le&s;s than u&s;ual; but as there is in general in the&s;e ca&s;es of fe|ver with weak pul&s;e a deficiency of the quantity of the blood, the pul&s;e in the hot fit is weaker than in health, though it is &s;tronger than in the cold fit, as explained in No. 2. of this &s;ection. But at the &s;ame time in tho&s;e fevers, where the defect of irritation is owing to the defect of the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, as well as to the defect of &s;timulus, another circum&s;tance occurs; which con&s;i&s;ts in the partial di&s;tribution of it, as appears in partial flu&s;hings, as of the face or bo|&s;om, while the extremities are cold; and in the increa&s;e of particular &s;ecretions, as of bile, &s;aliva, in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, with great heat of the &s;kin, or with partial &s;weats, or diarrhoea.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations attending the&s;e increa&s;ed ac|tions, which, like tho&s;e belonging to the hot fit of fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, are frequently followed by inflammation, as in &s;carlet fever; which inflammation is neverthele&s;s accompanied with a pul&s;e weaker, though quicker, than the pul&s;e during the remi&s;&s;ion or intermi&s;&s;ion of the paroxy&s;ms, though &s;tronger than that of the previous cold fit.</P>
<P>From hence I conclude, that both the cold and hot fits of fever are nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the perpetual and ince&s;&s;ant action of the ar|terial and glandular &s;y&s;tem; &s;ince tho&s;e mu&s;cular fibres and tho&s;e or|gans of &s;en&s;e, which are mo&s;t frequently exerted, become nece&s;&s;arily mo&s;t affected both with defect and accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power: and that hence <HI>fever-fits are not an effort of nature to relieve her&s;elf,</HI> and that therefore they &s;hould always be prevented or dimini&s;hed as much as po&s;&s;ible, by any means which decrea&s;e the general or partial

va&s;cular actions, when they are greater, or by increa&s;ing them when they are le&s;s than in health, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XII. 6. 1.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to explain, and I hope to the &s;atisfaction of the candid and patient reader, the principal &s;ymptoms or circum|&s;tances of fever without the introduction of the &s;upernatural power of &s;pa&s;m. To the arguments in favour of the doctrine of &s;pa&s;m it may be &s;ufficient to reply, that in the evolution of medical as well as of dramatic cata&s;trophe,</P>

<P N="1">I. 1. AS many motions of the body are excited and continued by irritations, &s;o others require, either conjunctly with the&s;e, or &s;epa|rately, the plea&s;urable or painful &s;en&s;ations, for the purpo&s;e of pro|ducing them with due energy. Among&s;t the&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s of di|ge&s;tion &s;upplies us with an in&s;tance: if the food, which we &s;wallow, is not attended with agreeable &s;en&s;ation, it dige&s;ts le&s;s perfectly; and if very di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation accompanies it, &s;uch as a nau&s;eous idea,

or very di&s;gu&s;tful ta&s;te, the dige&s;tion becomes impeded; or retrograde motions of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus &s;ucceed, and the food is ejected.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of generation depends &s;o much on agreeable &s;en&s;ation, that, where the object is di&s;gu&s;tful, neither voluntary exertion nor irri|tation can effect the purpo&s;e; which is al&s;o liable to be interrupted by the pain of fear or ba&s;hfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the plea&s;ure, which attends the irritations produced by the objects of lu&s;t and hunger, there &s;eems to be a &s;um of plea&s;urable af|fection accompanying the various &s;ecretions of the numerous glands, which con&s;titutes the plea&s;ure of life, in contradi&s;tinction to the te|dium vitae. This quantity or &s;um of plea&s;urable affection &s;eems to contribute to the due or energetic performance of the whole move|able &s;y&s;tem, as well that of the heart and arteries, as of dige&s;tion and of ab&s;orption; &s;ince without the due quantity of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tion, flatulency and hypochondriaci&s;m affect the inte&s;tines, and a lan|guor &s;eizes the arterial pul&s;ations and &s;ecretions; as occurs in great and continued anxiety of the mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be&s;ides the febrile motions occa&s;ioned by irritation, de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXII. and termed irritative fever, it frequently happens that pain is excited by the violence of the fibrous contractions; and other new motions are then &s;uperadded, in con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ation, which we &s;hall term febris &s;en&s;itiva, or &s;en&s;itive fever. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t irritative fevers begin with a decrea&s;ed exertion of irritation, owing to defect of &s;timulus; but that on the contrary the &s;en&s;itive fevers, or inflammations, generally begin with the increa&s;ed exertion of &s;en&s;ation, as mentioned in Sect. XXXI. on temperaments: for though the cold fit, which introduces inflammation, commences with decrea&s;ed irritation, yet the inflammation it&s;elf commences in the hot &s;it during the increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ation. Thus a common pu&s;tule, or phlegmon, in a part of little &s;en&s;ibility does not excite an inflamma|tory fever; but if the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, or the tender &s;ub&s;tance
<PB N="392" REF="406">
beneath the nails, be injured, great &s;en&s;ation is produced, and the whole &s;y&s;tem is thrown into that kind of exertion, which con&s;titutes inflammation.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;en&s;itive fevers, like the irritative ones, re&s;olve them&s;elves into tho&s;e with arterial &s;trength, and tho&s;e with arterial debility, that is with exce&s;s or defect of &s;en&s;orial power; the&s;e may be termed the febris &s;en&s;itiva pul&s;u forti, &s;en&s;itive fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, which is the &s;ynocha, or inflammatory fever; and the febris &s;en&s;itiva pul&s;u de|bili, &s;en&s;itive fever with weak pul&s;e, which is the typhus gravior, or putrid fever of &s;ome writers.</P>
<P N="3">3. The inflammatory fevers, which are here termed &s;en&s;itive fe|vers with &s;trong pul&s;e, are generally attended with &s;ome topical in|flammation, as pleuri&s;y, peripneumony, or rheumati&s;m, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes them from irritative fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e. The pul&s;e is &s;trong, quick, and full; for in this fever there is great irri|tation, as well as great &s;en&s;ation, employed in moving the arterial &s;y&s;tem. The &s;ize, or coagulable lymph, which appears on the blood, is probably an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion from the inflamed internal lining of the whole arterial &s;y&s;tem, the thinner part being taken away by the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the inflamed lymphatics.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;itive fevers with weak pul&s;e, which are termed putrid or malignant fevers, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from irritative fevers with weak pul&s;e, called nervous fevers, de&s;cribed in the la&s;t &s;ection, as the for|mer con&s;i&s;t of inflammation joined with debility, and the latter of de|bility alone. Hence there is greater heat and more florid colour of the &s;kin in the former, with petechiae, or purple &s;pots, and aphthae, or &s;loughs in the throat, and generally with previous contagion.</P>
<P>When animal matter dies, as a &s;lough in the throat, or the morti|fied part of a carbuncle, if it be kept moi&s;t and warm, as during its adhe&s;ion to a living body, it will &s;oon putri&s;y. This, and the origin of contagion from putrid animal &s;ub&s;tances, &s;eem to have given ri&s;e to the &s;eptic and anti&s;eptic theory of the&s;e fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="407">
The matter in pu&s;tules and ulcers is thus liable to become putrid, and to produce micro&s;copic animalcula; the urine, if too long re|tained, may al&s;o gain a putre&s;cent &s;mell, as well as the alvine feces; but &s;ome writers have gone &s;o far as to believe, that the blood it&s;elf in the&s;e fevers has &s;melt putrid, when drawn from the arm of the pa|tient: but this &s;eems not well founded; &s;ince a &s;ingle particle of putrid matter taken into the blood can produce fever, how can we conceive that the whole ma&s;s could continue a minute in a putrid &s;tate without de&s;troying life? Add to this, that putrid animal &s;ub&s;tances give up air, as in gangrenes; and that hence if the blood was putrid, air &s;hould be given out, which in the blood-ve&s;&s;els is known to occa&s;ion immediate death.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;en&s;itive fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e (or inflammations) there are two &s;en&s;orial faculties concerned in producing the di&s;ea&s;e, viz. ir|ritation and &s;en&s;ation; and hence, as their combined action is more violent, the general quantity of &s;en&s;orial power becomes further ex|hau&s;ted during the exacerbation, and the &s;y&s;tem more rapidly weak|ened than in irritative fever with &s;trong pul&s;e; where the &s;pirit of animation is weakened by but one mode of its exertion: &s;o that this febris &s;en&s;itiva pul&s;u forti (or inflammatory fever,) may be con&s;idered as the febris irritativa pul&s;u forti, with the addition of inflammation: and the febris &s;en&s;itiva pul&s;u debili (or malignant fever) may be con|&s;idered as the febris irritativa pul&s;u debili (or nervous fever), with the addition of inflammation.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the&s;e putrid or malignant fevers a deficiency of irritability ac|companies the increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility; and by this wa&s;te of &s;en&s;orial power by the exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, which was already too &s;mall, ari&s;es the delirium and &s;tupor which &s;o perpetually attend the&s;e inflamma|tory fevers with arterial debility. In the&s;e ca&s;es the voluntary power fir&s;t cea&s;es to act from deficiency of &s;en&s;orial &s;pirit; and the &s;timuli from external bodies have no effect on the exhau&s;ted &s;en&s;orial power, and a delirium like a dream is the con&s;equence. At length the in|ternal
<PB N="394" REF="408">
&s;timuli cea&s;e to excite &s;ufficient irritation, and the &s;ecretions are either not produced at all, or too par&s;imonious in quantity. Among&s;t the&s;e the &s;ecretion of the brain, or production of the &s;en&s;orial power, becomes deficient, till at la&s;t all &s;en&s;orial power cea&s;es, except what is ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to perform the vital motions, and a &s;tupor &s;ucceeds; which is thus owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e as the preceding delirium ex|erted in a greater degree.</P>
<P>This kind of delirium is owing to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, and to the di&s;obedience of the &s;en&s;es to external &s;timuli, and is always occa|&s;ioned by great debility, or paucity of &s;en&s;orial power; it is therefore a bad &s;ign at the end of inflammatory fevers, which had previous ar|terial &s;trength, as rheumati&s;m, or pleuri&s;y, as it &s;hews the pre&s;ence of great exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power in a &s;y&s;tem, which having lately been expo&s;ed to great excitement, is not &s;o liable to be &s;timulated into its healthy action, either by additional &s;timulus of food and medicines, or by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during its pre&s;ent torpor. In inflammatory fevers with debility, as tho&s;e termed putrid fevers, delirium is &s;ometimes, as well as &s;tupor, rather a favourable &s;ign; as le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power is wa&s;ted during its continuance (&s;ee Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 8.), and the con&s;titution not having been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to exce&s;s of &s;timulation, is more liable to be excited after previous quie&s;cence.</P>
<P>When the &s;um of general plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation becomes too great, another kind of delirium &s;upervenes, and the ideas thus excited are mi&s;taken for the irritations of external objects: &s;uch a delirium is pro|duced for a time by intoxicating drugs, as fermented liquors, or opium: a permanent delirium of this kind is &s;ometimes induced by the plea&s;ures of inordinate vanity, or by the enthu&s;ia&s;tic hopes of heaven. In the&s;e ca&s;es the power of volition is incapable of exertion, and in a great degree the external &s;en&s;es become incapable of perceiv|ing their adapted &s;timuli, becau&s;e the whole &s;en&s;orial power is em|ployed or expended on the ideas excited by plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="409">
This kind of delirium is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that which attends the fevers above mentioned from its not being accompanied with general debility, but &s;imply with exce&s;s of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation; and is therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure allied to madne&s;s or to reverie; it differs from the delirium of dreams, as in this the power of volition is not totally &s;u&s;pended, nor are the &s;en&s;es precluded from external &s;timula|tion; there is therefore a degree of con&s;i&s;tency, in this kind of deli|rium, and a degree of attention to external objects, neither of which exi&s;t in the delirium of fevers or in dreams.</P>
<P N="5">5. It would appear, that the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem of other animals are le&s;s liable to be put into action by their general &s;um of plea&s;ureable or painful &s;en&s;ation; and that the trains of their ideas, and the mu&s;cular motions u&s;ually a&s;&s;ociated with them, are le&s;s powerfully connected than in the human &s;y&s;tem. For other animals neither weep, nor &s;mile, nor laugh; and are hence &s;eldom &s;ubject to delirium, as treated of in Sect. XVI. on In&s;tinct. Now as our epidemic and contagious di&s;ea&s;es are probably produced by di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and not &s;imply by irritation; there appears a rea&s;on, why brute animals are le&s;s liable to epidemic or contagious di&s;ea&s;es; and &s;econdly, why none of our contagions, as the &s;mall-pox or mea&s;les, can be communicated to them, though one of theirs, viz. the hydrophobia, as well as many of their poi&s;ons, as tho&s;e of &s;nakes and of in&s;ects, communicate their deleterious or painful effects to mankind.</P>
<P>Where the quantity of general painful &s;en&s;ation is too great in the &s;y&s;tem, inordinate voluntary exertions are produced either of our ideas, as in melancholy and madne&s;s, or of our mu&s;cles, as in con|vul&s;ion. From the&s;e maladies al&s;o brute animals are much more ex|empt than mankind, owing to their greater inaptitude to voluntary exertion, as mentioned in Sect. XVI. on In&s;tinct.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">II. 1. When any moving organ is excited into &s;uch violent mo|tions, that a quantity of plea&s;ureable or painful &s;en&s;ation is produced, it frequently happens (but not always) that new motions of the af|fected
<PB N="396" REF="410">
organ are generated in con&s;equence of the pain or plea&s;ure, which are termed inflammation.</P>
<P>The&s;e new motions are of a peculiar kind, tending to di&s;tend the old, and to produce new fibres, and thence to elongate the &s;traight mu&s;cles, which &s;erve locomotion, and to form new ve&s;&s;els at the ex|tremities or &s;ides of the va&s;cular mu&s;cles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thus the plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ations produce an enlargement of the nipples of nur&s;es, of the papillae of the tongue, of the penis, and probably produce the growth of the body from its embryon &s;tate to its maturity; whil&s;t the new motions in con&s;equence of painful &s;en&s;a|tion, with the growth of the fibres or ve&s;&s;els, which they occa&s;ion, are termed inflammation.</P>
<P>Hence when the &s;traight mu&s;cles are inflamed, part of their ten|dons at each extremity gain new life and &s;en&s;ibility, and thus the mu&s;cle is for a time elongated; and inflamed bones become &s;oft, va&s;|cular, and &s;en&s;ible. Thus new ve&s;&s;els &s;hoot over the cornea of in|flamed eyes, and into &s;chirrous tumours, when they become inflamed; and hence all inflamed parts grow together by intermixture, and in|o&s;culation of the new and old ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The heat is occa&s;ioned from the increa&s;ed &s;ecretions either of mu|cus, or of the fibres, which produce or elongate the ve&s;&s;els. The red colour is owing to the pellucidity of the newly formed ve&s;&s;els, and as the arterial parts of them are probably formed before their corre|&s;pondent venous parts.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e new motions are excited either from the increa&s;ed quan|tity of &s;en&s;ation in con&s;equence of greater fibrous contractions, or from increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility, that is, from the increa&s;ed quantity of &s;en|&s;orial power in the moving organ. Hence they are induced by great external &s;timuli, as by wounds, broken bones; and by acrid or in|&s;ectious materials; or by common &s;timuli on tho&s;e organs, which have been &s;ome time quie&s;cent; as the u&s;ual light of the day inflames the eyes of tho&s;e, who have been con&s;ined in dungeons; and the
<PB N="397" REF="411">
warmth of a common fire inflames tho&s;e, who have been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to much cold.</P>
<P>But the&s;e new motions are never generated by that pain, which ari&s;es from defect of &s;timulus, as from hunger, thir&s;t, cold, or in|anition, with all tho&s;e pains, which are termed nervous. Where the&s;e pains exi&s;t, the motions of the affected part are le&s;&s;ened; and if inflammation &s;ucceeds, it is in &s;ome di&s;tant parts; as coughs are cau&s;ed by coldne&s;s and moi&s;ture being long applied to the feet; or it is in con&s;equence of the renewal of the &s;timulus, as of heat or food, which excites our organs into &s;tronger action after their temporary quie&s;cence; as kibed heels after walking in &s;now.</P>
<P N="4">4. But when the&s;e new motions of the va&s;cular mu&s;cles are ex|erted with greater violence, and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are either elongated too much or too ha&s;tily, a new material is &s;ecreted from their extremi|ties, which is of various kinds according to the peculiar animal mo|tions of this new kind of gland, which &s;ecretes it; &s;uch is the pus laudabile or common matter, the variolous matter, vencreal matter, catarrhous matter, and many others.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e matters are the product of an animal proce&s;s; they are &s;ecreted or produced from the blood by certain di&s;ea&s;ed motions of the extremities of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, and are on that account all of them contagious; for if a portion of any of the&s;e matters is tran&s;mitted into the circulation, or perhaps only in&s;erted into the &s;kin, or beneath the cuticle of an healthy per&s;on, its &s;timulus in a certain time produces the &s;ame kind of morbid motions, by which it&s;elf was produced; and hence a &s;imilar matter is generated. See Sect. XXXIX. 6. 1.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is remarkable, that many of the&s;e contagious matters are capable of producing a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e but once; as the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les; and I &s;uppo&s;e this is true of all tho&s;e contagious di&s;ea&s;es, which are &s;pontaneou&s;ly cured by nature in a certain time; for if the body was capable of receiving the di&s;ea&s;e a &s;econd time, the patient mu&s;t perpetually infect him&s;elf by the very matter, which he has
<PB N="398" REF="412">
him&s;elf produced, and is lodged about him; and hence he could never become free from the di&s;ea&s;e. Something &s;imilar to this is &s;een in the &s;econdary fever of the confluent &s;mall-pox; there is a great ab&s;orption of variolous matter, a very minute part of which would give the genuine &s;mall-pox to another per&s;on; but here it only &s;timulates the &s;y&s;tem into common fever; like that which common pus, or any other acrid material might occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the pulmonary con&s;umption, where common matter is daily ab&s;orbed, an irritative fever only, not an inflammatory one, is produced; which is terminated like other irritative fevers by &s;weats, or loo&s;e &s;tools. Hence it does not appear, that this ab&s;orbed matter always acts as a contagious material producing fre&s;h inflammation or new ab&s;ce&s;&s;es. Though there is rea&s;on to believe, that the fir&s;t time any common matter is ab&s;orbed, it has this effect, but not the &s;econd time, like the variolous matter above mentioned.</P>
<P>This accounts for the opinion, that the pulmonary con&s;umption is &s;ometimes infectious, which opinion was held by the ancients, and continues in Italy at pre&s;ent; and I have my&s;elf &s;een three or four in&s;tances, where a hu&s;band and wife, who have &s;lept together, and have thus much received each other's breath, who have infected each other, and both died in con&s;equence of the original taint of only one of them. This al&s;o accounts for the ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in various parts of the body, that are &s;ometimes produced after the inoculated &s;mall-pox is terminated; for this &s;econd ab&s;orption of variolous matter acts like common matter, and produces only irritative fever in tho&s;e children, who&s;e con&s;titutions have already experienced the ab&s;orption of com|mon matter; and inflammation with a tendency to produce new ab|&s;ce&s;&s;es in tho&s;e, who&s;e con&s;titutions have not experienced the ab&s;orp|tions of common matter.</P>
<P>It is probable, that more certain proofs might have been found to &s;hew, that common matter is infectious the fir&s;t time it is ab&s;orbed,
<PB N="399" REF="413">
tending to produce &s;imilar ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, but not the &s;econd time of its ab&s;orption, if this &s;ubject had been attended to.</P>
<P N="8">8. The&s;e contagious di&s;ea&s;es are very numerous, as the plague, &s;mall-pox, chicken-pox, mea&s;les, &s;carlet-fever, pemphigus, catarrh, chincough, venereal di&s;ea&s;e, itch, trichoma, tinea. The infectious material does not &s;eem to be di&s;&s;olved by the air, but only mixed with it perhaps in fine powder, which &s;oon &s;ub&s;ides; &s;ince many of the&s;e contagions can only be received by actual contact; and others of them only at &s;mall di&s;tances from the infected per&s;on; as is evident from many per&s;ons having been near patients of the &s;mall-pox with|out acquiring the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on, why many of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are received but once, and others repeatedly, is not well under&s;tood; it appears to me, that the con&s;titution becomes &s;o accu&s;tomed to the &s;timuli of the&s;e infec|tious materials, by having once experienced them, that though irri|tative motions, as hectic fevers, may again be produced by them, yet no &s;en&s;ation, and in con&s;equence no general inflammation &s;ucceeds; as di&s;agreeable &s;mells or ta&s;tes by habit cea&s;e to be perceived; they continue indeed to excite irritative ideas on the organs of &s;en&s;e, but the&s;e are not &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>There are many irritative motions, which were at fir&s;t &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation, but which by frequent repetition cea&s;e to excite &s;en&s;a|tion, as explained in Sect. XX. on Vertigo. And, that this circum|&s;tance exi&s;ts in re&s;pect to infectious matter appears from a known fact; that nur&s;es, who have had the &s;mall-pox, are liable to experi|ence &s;mall ulcers on their arms by the contact of variolous matter in li&s;ting their patients; and that when patients, who have formerly had the &s;mall-pox have been inoculated in the arm, a phlegmon, or inflamed &s;ore, has &s;ucceeded, but no &s;ub&s;equent fever. Which &s;hews, that the contagious matter of the &s;mall-pox has not lo&s;t its power of &s;timulating the part it is applied to, but that the general
<PB N="400" REF="414">
&s;y&s;tem is not affected in con&s;equence. See Section XII. 7. 6. XIX. 10.</P>
<P N="9">9. From the accounts of the plague, virulent catarrh, and putrid dy&s;entery, it &s;eems uncertain, whether the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are experienced more than once; but the venereal di&s;ea&s;e and itch are doubtle&s;s re|peatedly infectious; and as the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are never cured &s;pontaneou&s;ly, but require medicines, which act without apparent operation, &s;ome have &s;u&s;pected, that the contagious material produces &s;imilar matter rather by a chemical change of the fluids, than by an animal proce&s;s; and that the &s;pecific medicines de&s;troy their virus by chemically com|bining with it. This opinion is &s;ucce&s;sfully combated by Mr. Hun|ter, in his Treati&s;e on Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, Part I. c. i.</P>
<P>But this opinion wants the &s;upport of analogy, as there is no known proce&s;s in animal bodies, which is purely chemical, not even dige&s;tion; nor can any of the&s;e matters be produced by chemical pro|ce&s;&s;es. Add to this, that it is probable, that the in&s;ects, ob&s;erved in the pu&s;tules of the itch, and in the &s;tools of dy&s;enteric patients, are the con&s;equences, and not the cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. And that the &s;pecific medicines, which cure the itch and lues venerea, as brim&s;tone and mercury, act only by increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption of the matter in the ulcu&s;cles of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, and thence di&s;po&s;ing them to heal; which would otherwi&s;e continue to &s;pread.</P>
<P>Why the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, and itch, and tenia, or &s;cald head, are repeatedly contagious, while tho&s;e contagions attended with fever can be received but once, &s;eems to depend on their being rather local di&s;|ea&s;es than univer&s;al ones, and are hence not attended with fever, ex|cept the purulent fever in their la&s;t &s;tages, when the patient is de&s;troy|ed by them. On this account the whole of the &s;y&s;tem does not be|come habituated to the&s;e morbid actions, &s;o as to cea&s;e to be affected with &s;en&s;ation by a repetition of the contagion. Thus the contagious matter of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, and of the tenia, affects the lymphatic
<PB N="401" REF="415">
glands, as the inquinal glands, and tho&s;e about the roots of the hair and neck, where it is arre&s;ted, but does not &s;eem to affect the blood|ve&s;&s;els, &s;ince no fever en&s;ues.</P>
<P>Hence it would appear, that the&s;e kinds of contagion are propa|gated not by means of the circulation, but by &s;ympathy of di&s;tant parts with each other; &s;ince if a di&s;tant part, as the palate, &s;hould be excited by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation into the &s;ame kind of motions, as the parts originally affected by the contact of infectious matter; that di&s;tant part will produce the &s;ame kind of infectious matter; for every &s;ecretion from the blood is formed from it by the peculiar motions of the &s;ine extremities of the gland, which &s;ecretes it; the various &s;e|creted fluids, as the bile, &s;aliva, ga&s;tric juice, not previou&s;ly exi&s;ting, as &s;uch, in the blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>And this peculiar &s;ympathy between the genitals and the throat, owing to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, appears not only in the production of venereal ulcers in the throat, but in variety of other in&s;tances, as in the mumps, in the hydrophobia, &s;ome coughs, &s;trangulation, the production of the beard, change of voice at puberty. Which are fur|ther de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 7.</P>
<P>To evince that the production of &s;uch large quantities of contagi|ous matter, as are &s;een in &s;ome variolous patients, &s;o as to cover the whole &s;kin almo&s;t with pu&s;tules, does not ari&s;e from any chemical fer|mentation in the blood, but that it is owing to morbid motions of the fine extremities of the capillaries, or glands, whether the&s;e be rup|tured or not, appears from the quantity of this matter always cor|re&s;ponding with the quantity of the fever; that is, with the violent exertions of tho&s;e glands and capillaries, which are the terminations of the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The truth of this theory is evinced further by a circum&s;tance ob|&s;erved by Mr. J. Hunter, in his Treati&s;e on Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e; that in a patient, who was inoculated for the &s;mall-pox, and who appear|ed afterwards to have been previou&s;ly infected with the mea&s;les,
<PB N="402" REF="416">
the progre&s;s of the &s;mall-pox was delayed till the mea&s;les had run their cour&s;e, and that then the &s;mall-pox went through its u&s;ual periods.</P>
<P>Two &s;imilar ca&s;es fell under my care, which I &s;hall here relate, as it confirms that of Mr. Hunter, and contributes to illu&s;trate this part of the theory of contagious di&s;ea&s;es. I have tran&s;cribed the particu|lars from a letter of Mr. Lightwood of Yoxal, the &s;urgeon who daily attended them, and at my reque&s;t, after I had &s;een them, kept a kind of journal of their ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s H. and Mi&s;s L. two &s;i&s;ters, the one about four and the other about three years old, were inoculated Feb. 7, 1791. On the 10th there was a redne&s;s on both arms di&s;cernible by a gla&s;s. On the 11th their arms were &s;o much inflamed as to leave no doubt of the infection having taken place. On the 12th le&s;s appearance of in|flammation on their arms. In the evening Mi&s;s L. had an eruption, which re&s;embled the mea&s;les. On the 13th the eruption on Mi&s;s L. was very full on the face and brea&s;t, like the mea&s;les, with con&s;ider|able fever. It was now known, that the mea&s;les were in a farm hou&s;e in the neighbourhood. Mi&s;s H.'s arm le&s;s inflamed than ye&s;terday. On the 14th Mi&s;s L.'s fever great, and the eruption univer&s;al. The arm appears to be healed. Mi&s;s H.'s arm &s;omewhat redder. They were now put into &s;eparate rooms. On the 15th Mi&s;s L.'s arms as ye&s;terday. Eruption continues. Mi&s;s H.'s arms have varied but little. 16th, the eruptions on Mi&s;s L. are dying away, her fever gone. Be|gins to have a little redne&s;s in one arm at the place of inoculation. Mi&s;s H.'s arms get redder, but &s;he has no appearance of complaint. 20th, Mi&s;s L.'s arms have advanced &s;lowly till this day, and now a few pu&s;tules appear. Mi&s;s H.'s arm has made little progre&s;s from the 16th to this day, and now &s;he has &s;ome fever. 21&s;t, Mi&s;s L. as ye&s;terday. Mi&s;s H. has much inflammation, and an increa&s;e of the red circle on one arm to the &s;ize of half a crown, and had much fever at night, with fetid breath. 22d, Mi&s;s L.'s pu&s;tules continue advanc|ing.
<PB N="403" REF="417">
Mi&s;s H.'s inflammation of her arm and red circle increa&s;es. A few red &s;pots appear in different parts with &s;ome degree of fever this morning. 23d Mi&s;s L. has a larger crop of pu&s;tules. Mi&s;s H. has &s;mall pu&s;tules and great inflammation of her arms, with but one pu&s;tule likely to &s;uppurate. After this day they gradually got well, and the pu&s;tules di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e ca&s;es the mea&s;les went through their common cour&s;e with milder &s;ymptoms than u&s;ual, and in the other the mea&s;ly conta|gion &s;eemed ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;top the progre&s;s of variolous contagion, but without it&s;elf throwing the con&s;titution into any di&s;order. At the &s;ame time both the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox &s;eem to have been rendered milder. Does not this give an idea, that if they were both inoculated at the &s;ame time, that neither of them might affect the patient?</P>
<P>From the&s;e ca&s;es I contend, that the contagious matter of the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es does not affect the con&s;titution by a fermentation, or chemical change of the blood, becau&s;e then they mu&s;t have proceeded together, and have produced a third &s;omething, not exactly &s;imilar to either of them: but that they produce new motions of the cutaneous termina|tions of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, which for a time proceed daily with increa&s;|ing activity, like &s;ome paroxy&s;ms of fever, till they at length &s;ecrete or form a &s;imilar poi&s;on by the&s;e unnatural actions.</P>
<P>Now as in the mea&s;les one kind of unnatural motion takes place, and in the &s;mall-pox another kind, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the&s;e different kinds of morbid motions cannot exi&s;t together; and there|fore, that that which has fir&s;t begun will continue till the &s;y&s;tem be|comes habituated to the &s;timulus which occa&s;ions it, and has cea&s;ed to be thrown into action by it; and then the other kind of &s;timulus will in its turn produce fever, and new kinds of motions peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="10">10. On further con&s;idering the action of contagious matter, &s;ince the former part of this work was &s;ent to the pre&s;s; where I have a&s;|&s;erted, in Sect. XII. 3. 6. that it is probable, that the variolous matter is di&s;fu&s;ed through the blood; I prevailed on my friend Mr. Power,
<PB N="404" REF="418">
&s;urgeon at Bo&s;worth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire to try, whether the &s;mall-pox could be inoculated by u&s;ing the blood of a variolous patient in&s;tead of the matter from the pu&s;tules; as I thought &s;uch an experiment migh throw &s;ome light at lea&s;t on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The fol|lowing is an extract from his letter:&mdash;</P>
<P>"March 11, 1793. I inoculated two children, who had not had the &s;mall-pox, with blood; which was taken from a patient on the &s;econd day after the eruption commenced, and before it was com|pleted. And at the &s;ame time I inoculated my&s;elf with blood from the &s;ame per&s;on, in order to compare the appearances, which might ari&s;e in a per&s;on liable to receive the infection, and in one not liable to receive it. On the &s;ame day I inoculated four other children liable to receive the infection with blood taken from another per&s;on on the fourth day after the commencement of the eruption. The patients from whom the blood was taken had the di&s;ea&s;e mildly, but had the mo&s;t pu&s;tules of any I could &s;elect from twenty inoculated patients; and as much of the blood was in&s;inuated under the cuticle as I could introduce by elevating the &s;kin without drawing blood; and three or four &s;uch punctures were made in each of their arms, and the blood was u&s;ed in its fluid &s;tate.</P>
<P>"As the appearances in all the&s;e patients, as well as in my&s;elf, were &s;imilar, I &s;hall only mention them in general terms. March 13. A &s;light &s;ubcuticular di&s;coloration, with rather a livid appearance, without &s;orene&s;s or pain, was vi&s;ible in them all, as well as in my own hand. 15. The di&s;coloration &s;omewhat le&s;s, without pain or &s;orene&s;s. Some patients inoculated on the &s;ame day with variolous matter have con&s;iderable inflammation. 17. The di&s;coloration is quite gone in them all, and from my own hand, a dry mark only re|maining. And they were all inoculated on the 18th, with variolous matter, which produced the di&s;ea&s;e in them all."</P>
<P>Mr. Power afterwards ob&s;erves, that, as the patients from whom the blood was taken had the di&s;ea&s;e mildly, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that
<PB N="405" REF="419">
though the contagious matter might be mixed with the blood, it might &s;till be in too dilute a &s;tate to convey the infection; but adds at the &s;ame time, that he has diluted recent matter with at lea&s;t five times its quantity of water, and which has &s;till given the infection; though he has &s;ometimes diluted it &s;o far as to fail.</P>
<P>The following experiments were in&s;tituted at my reque&s;t by my friend Mr. Hadley, &s;urgeon in Derby, to a&s;certain whether the blood of a per&s;on in the &s;mall-pox be capable of communicating the di&s;ea&s;e. "Experiment 1&s;t. October 18th, 1793. I took &s;ome blood from a vein in the arm of a per&s;on, who had the &s;mall-pox on the &s;econd day of the eruption, and introduced a &s;mall quantity of it immedi|ately with the point of a lancet between the &s;carf and true &s;kin of the right arm of a boy nine years old in two or three different places; the other arm was inoculated with variolous matter at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>"19th. The punctured parts of the right arm were &s;urrounded with &s;ome degree of &s;ubcuticular inflammation. 20th. The inflam|mation more con&s;iderable, with a &s;light degree of itching, but no pain upon pre&s;&s;ure. 21&s;t. Upon examining the arm this day with a lens I found the inflammation le&s;s exten&s;ive, and the redne&s;s changing to a deep yellow or orange-colour. 22d. Inflammation nearly gone. 23d. Nothing remained, except a &s;light di&s;coloration and a little &s;curfy appearance on the punctures. At the &s;ame time the inflammation of the arm inoculated with variolous matter was increa&s;ing fa&s;t, and he had the di&s;ea&s;e mildly at the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>"Experiment 2d. I inoculated another child at the &s;ame time and in the &s;ame manner, with blood taken on the fir&s;t day of the erup|tion; but as the appearance and effects were &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the preceding experiment, I &s;hall not relate them minutely.</P>
<P>Experiment 3d. October 20th. Blood was taken from a per&s;on who had the &s;mall-pox, on the third day of the eruption, and on the &s;ixth from the commencement of the eruptive fever. I introduced &s;ome of it in its fluid &s;tate into both arms of a boy &s;even years old.
<PB N="406" REF="420">
21&s;t. There appeared to be &s;ome inflammation under the cuticle, where the punctures were made. 22d. Inflammation more con|&s;iderable. 23d. On this day the inflammation was &s;omewhat greater, and the cuticle rather elevated.</P>
<P>24th. Inflammation much le&s;s, and only a brown or orange-colour remained. 25th. Scarcely any di&s;coloration left. On this day he was inoculated with variolous matter, the progre&s;s of the infection went on in the u&s;ual way, and he had the &s;mall-pox very favour|ably.</P>
<P>"At this time I was reque&s;ted to inoculate a young per&s;on, who was thought to have had the &s;mall-pox, but his parents were not quite certain; in one arm I introduced variolous matter, and in the other blood, taken as in experiment 3d. On the &s;econd day after the ope|ration, the punctured parts were inflamed, though I think the arm in which I had in&s;erted variolous matter was rather more &s;o than the other. On the third the inflammation was increa&s;ed, and looked much the &s;ame as in the preceding experiment. 4th. The inflam|mation was much dimini&s;hed, and on the 5th almo&s;t gone. He was expo&s;ed at the &s;ame time to the natural infection, but has continued perfectly well.</P>
<P>"I have frequently ob&s;erved (and believe mo&s;t practitioners have done the &s;ame), that if variolous matter be in&s;erted in the arm of a per&s;on who has previou&s;ly had the &s;mall-pox, that the inflammation on the &s;econd or third days is much greater, than if they had not had the di&s;ea&s;e, but on the fourth or fifth it di&s;appears.</P>
<P>"On the 23d I introduced blood into the arms of three more chil|dren, taken on the third and fourth days of the eruption. The ap|pearances were much the &s;ame as mentioned in experiments fir&s;t and third. They were afterwards inoculated with variolous matter, and had the di&s;ea&s;e in the regular way.</P>
<P>"The above experiments were made with blood taken from a &s;mall vein in the hand or foot of three or four different patients,
<PB N="407" REF="421">
whom I had at that time under inoculation. They were &s;elected from 160, as having the greate&s;t number of pu&s;tules. The part was wa&s;hed with warm water before the blood was taken, to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of any matter being mixed with it from the &s;urface."</P>
<P>Shall we conclude from hence, that the variolous matter never en|ters the blood-ve&s;&s;els? but that the morbid motions of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin around the in&s;ertion of it continue to increa&s;e in a larger and larger circle for &s;ix or &s;even days; that then their quantity of morbid action becomes great enough to produce a fever-fit, and to affect the &s;tomach by a&s;&s;ociation of motions? and finally, that a &s;econd a&s;&s;ocia|tion of motions is produced between the &s;tomach and the other parts of the &s;kin, inducing them into morbid actions &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the circle round the in&s;ertion of the variolous matter? Many more ex|periments and ob&s;ervations are required before this important que&s;tion can be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered.</P>
<P>It may be adduced, that as the matter in&s;erted into the &s;kin of the arm frequently &s;wells the lymphatic in the axilla, that in that cir|cum&s;tance it &s;eems to be there arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s, and cannot be imagined to enter the blood by that lymphatic gland till the &s;welling of it &s;ub&s;ides. Some other phaenomena of the di&s;ea&s;e are more ea&s;ily reconcileable to this theory of &s;ympathetic motions than to that of ab&s;orption; as the time taken up between the in&s;ertion of the matter, and the operation of it on the &s;y&s;tem, as mentioned above. For the circle around the in&s;ertion is &s;een to increa&s;e, and to inflame; and I believe, undergoes a kind of diurnal paroxy&s;m of torpor and palene&s;s with a &s;ucceeding increa&s;e of action and colour, like a topical fever|fit. Whereas if the matter is conceived to circulate for &s;ix or &s;even days with the blood, without producing di&s;order, it ought to be ren|dered milder, or the blood-ve&s;&s;els more familiarized to its acrimony.</P>
<P>It is much ea&s;ier to conceive from this doctrine of a&s;&s;ociated or &s;ympathetic motions of di&s;tant parts of the &s;y&s;tem, how it happens, that the variolous in&s;ection can be received but once, as before ex|plained;
<PB N="408" REF="422">
than by &s;uppo&s;ing, that a change is effected in the ma&s;s of blood by any kind of fermentative proce&s;s.</P>
<P>The curious circum&s;tance of the two contagions of &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les not acting at the &s;ame time, but one of them re&s;ting or &s;u&s;|pending its action till that of the other cea&s;es, may be much ea&s;ier explained from &s;ympathetic or a&s;&s;ociated actions of the infected part with other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, than it can from &s;uppo&s;ing the two contagions to enter the circulation.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of the face is &s;ubject to more frequent vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, from its expo&s;ure to the open air, and is in con&s;equence more liable to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation with the &s;tomach than any other part of the &s;urface of the body, becau&s;e their actions have been more fre|quently thus a&s;&s;ociated. Thus in a &s;urfeit from drinking cold water, when a per&s;on is very hot and fatigued, an eruption is liable to appear on the face in con&s;equence of this &s;ympathy. In the &s;ame manner the ro&s;y eruption on the faces of drunkards more probably ari&s;es from the &s;ympathy of the face with the &s;tomach, rather than between the face and the liver, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This &s;ympathy between the &s;tomach and the &s;kin of the face is ap|parent in the eruption of the &s;mall-pox; &s;ince, where the di&s;ea&s;e is in con&s;iderable quantity, the eruption on the face fir&s;t &s;ucceeds the &s;ick|ne&s;s of the &s;tomach. In the natural di&s;ea&s;e the &s;tomach &s;eems to be frequently primarily affected, either alone or along with the ton&s;ils, as the matter &s;eems to be only diffu&s;ed in the air, and by being mixed with the &s;aliva, or mucus of the ton&s;ils, to be &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>After &s;ome days the irritative circles of motions become di&s;ordered by this new &s;timulus, which acts upon the mucous lining of the &s;to|mach; and &s;ickne&s;s, vertigo, and a diurnal fever &s;ucceed. The&s;e di&s;ordered irritative motions become daily increa&s;ed for two or three days, and then by their increa&s;ed action certain &s;en&s;itive motions, or inflammation, is produced&punc; and at the next cold &s;it of fever, when
<PB N="409" REF="423">
the &s;tomach recovers from its torpor, an inflammation of the exter|nal &s;kin is formed in points (which afterwards &s;uppurate), by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, in the &s;ame manner as a cough is produced in con&s;equence of expo&s;ing the feet to cold, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXV. 1. 1. and Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 4. If the inoculated &s;kin of the arm, as far as it ap|pears inflamed, was to be cut out, or de&s;troyed by cau&s;tic, before the fever commenced, as &s;uppo&s;e on the fourth day after inoculation, would this prevent the di&s;ea&s;e? as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent the hy|drophobia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">III. 1. Where the new ve&s;&s;els, and enlarged old ones, which con&s;titute inflammation, are not &s;o ha&s;tily di&s;tended as to bur&s;t, and form a new kind of gland for the &s;ecretion of matter, as above men|tioned; if &s;uch circum&s;tances happen as dimini&s;h the painful &s;en&s;a|tion, the tendency to growth cea&s;es, and by and by an ab&s;orption commences, not only of the &s;uperabundant quantity of fluids depo|&s;ited in the inflamed part, but of the &s;olids likewi&s;e, and this even of the harde&s;t kind.</P>
<P>Thus during the growth of the &s;econd &s;et of teeth in children, the roots of the fir&s;t &s;et are totally ab&s;orbed, till at length nothing of them remains but the crown; though a few weeks before, if they are drawn immaturely, their roots are found complete. Similar to this Mr. Hunter has ob&s;erved, that where a dead piece of bone is to exfo|liate, or to &s;eparate from a living one, that the dead part does not pu|trify, but remains perfectly &s;ound, while the &s;urface of the living part of the bone, which is in contact with the dead part, becomes ab&s;orbed, and thus effects its &s;eparation. Med. Comment. Edinb. V. 1. 425. In the &s;ame manner the calcareous matter of gouty concre|tions, the coagulable lymph depo&s;ited on inflamed membranes in rheu|mati&s;m and extrava&s;ated blood become ab&s;orbed; which are all as &s;o|lid and as indi&s;&s;oluble materials as the new ve&s;&s;els produced in inflam|mation.</P>
<P>This ab&s;orption of the new ve&s;&s;els and depo&s;ited fluids of inflamed
<PB N="410" REF="424">
parts is called re&s;olution: it is produced by fir&s;t u&s;ing &s;uch internal means as decrea&s;e the pain of the part, and in con&s;equence its new motions, as repeated bleeding, cathartics, diluent potations, and warm bath.</P>
<P>After the ve&s;&s;els are thus emptied, and the ab&s;orption of the new ve&s;&s;els and depo&s;ited fluids is evidently begun, it is much promoted by &s;timulating the part externally by &s;olutions of lead, or other me|tals, and internally by the bark, and &s;mall do&s;es of opium. Hence when an ophthalmy begins to become paler, any acrid eye-water, as a &s;olution of &s;ix grains of white vitriol in an ounce of water, ha&s;tens the ab&s;orption, and clears the eye in a very &s;hort time. But the &s;ame application u&s;ed a few days &s;ooner would have increa&s;ed the inflam|mation. Hence after evacuation opium in &s;mall do&s;es may contri|bute to promote the ab&s;orption of fluids depo&s;ited on the brain, as ob|&s;erved by Mr. Bromfield in his treati&s;e of &s;urgery.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where an ab&s;ce&s;s is formed by the rupture of the&s;e new ve&s;&s;els, the violence of inflammation cea&s;es, and a new gland &s;eparates a ma|terial called pus: at the &s;ame time a le&s;s degree of inflammation pro|duces new ve&s;&s;els called vulgarly proud fle&s;h; which, if no bandage confines its growth, nor any other circum&s;tance promotes ab&s;orption in the wound, would ri&s;e to a great height above the u&s;ual &s;ize of the part.</P>
<P>Hence the art of healing ulcers con&s;i&s;ts in producing a tendency to ab&s;orption in the wound greater than the depo&s;ition. Thus when an ill-conditioned ulcer &s;eparates a copious and thin di&s;charge, by the u&s;e of any &s;timulus, as of &s;alts of lead, or mercury, or copper exter|nally applied, the di&s;charge becomes dimini&s;hed in quantity, and be|comes thicker, as the thinner parts are fir&s;t ab&s;orbed.</P>
<P>But nothing &s;o much contributes to increa&s;e the ab&s;orption in a wound as covering the whole limb above the &s;ore with a bandage, which &s;hould be &s;pread with &s;ome pla&s;ter, as with empla&s;trum de minio, to prevent it from &s;lipping. By this artificial tight|ne&s;s
<PB N="411" REF="425">
of the &s;kin, the arterial pul&s;ations act with double their u&s;ual power in promoting the a&s;cending current of the fluid in the val|vular lymphatics.</P>
<P>Internally the ab&s;orption from ulcers &s;hould be promoted fir&s;t by evacuation, then by opium, bark, mercury, &s;teel.</P>
<P N="3">3. Where the inflammation proceeds with greater violence or ra|pidity, that is, when by the painful &s;en&s;ation a more inordinate ac|tivity of the organ is produced, and by this great activity an additional quantity of painful &s;en&s;ation follows in an increa&s;ing ratio, till the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power, or &s;pirit of animation, in the part be|comes exhau&s;ted, a mortification en&s;ues, as in a carbuncle, in in|flammations of the bowels, in the extremities of old people, or in the limbs of tho&s;e who are brought near a fire after having been much benumbed with cold. And from hence it appears, why weak people are more &s;ubject to mortification than &s;trong ones, and why in weak per&s;ons le&s;s pain will produce mortification, namely, becau&s;e the &s;en|&s;orial power is &s;ooner exhau&s;ted by any exce&s;s of activity. I remem|ber &s;eeing a gentleman who had the preceding day travelled two &s;tages in a chai&s;e with what he termed a bearable pain in his bowels; which when I &s;aw him had cea&s;ed rather &s;uddenly, and without a pa&s;&s;age through him; his pul&s;e was then weak, though not very quick; but as nothing which he &s;wallowed would continue in his &s;tomach many minutes, I concluded that the bowel was mortified; he died on the next day. It is u&s;ual for patients &s;inking under the &s;mall-pox with mortified pu&s;tules, and with purple &s;pots intermixed, to complain of no pain, but to &s;ay they are pretty well to the la&s;t moment.</P>

<HEAD>Recapitulation.</HEAD>
<P>IV. When the motions of any part of the &s;y&s;tem, in con&s;equence of previous torpor, are performed with more energy than in the irri|tative fevers, a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is produced, and new actions of &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem commence in con&s;equence of this &s;en&s;ation conjointly with the irritation; which motions con&s;titute inflamma|tion. If the fever be attended with a &s;trong pul&s;e, as in pleuri&s;y, or rheumati&s;m, it is termed &s;ynocha &s;en&s;itiva, or &s;en&s;itive fever with &s;trong pul&s;e; which is u&s;ually termed inflammatory fever. If it be attended with weak pul&s;e, it is termed typhus &s;en&s;itivus, or &s;en&s;itive fever with weak pul&s;e, or typhus gravior, or putrid malignant fever.</P>
<P>The &s;ynocha &s;en&s;itiva, or &s;en&s;itive fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, is ge|nerally attended with &s;ome topical inflammation, as in peripneumony, hepatitis, and is accompanied with much coagulable lymph, or &s;ize; which ri&s;es to the &s;urface of the blood, when taken into a ba&s;on, as it cools; and which is believed to be the increa&s;ed mucous &s;ecretion from the coats of the arteries, in&s;pi&s;&s;ated by a greater ab&s;orption of its aqueous and &s;aline part, and perhaps changed by its delay in the circulation.</P>
<P>The typhus &s;en&s;itivus, or &s;en&s;itive fever with weak pul&s;e, is fre|quently attended with delirium, which is cau&s;ed by the deficiency of the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, and with variety of cutaneous eruptions.</P>
<P>Inflammation is cau&s;ed by the pains occa&s;ioned by exce&s;s of action, and not by tho&s;e pains which are occa&s;ioned by defect of action. The&s;e morbid actions, which are thus produced by two &s;en&s;orial powers, viz. by irritation and &s;en&s;ation, &s;ecrete new living &s;ibres,
<PB N="413" REF="427">
which elongate the old ve&s;&s;els, or form new ones, and at the &s;ame time much heat is evolved from the&s;e combinations. By the rupture of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or by a new con&s;truction of their apertures, purulent matters are &s;ecreted of various kinds; which are infectious the fir&s;t time they are applied to the &s;kin beneath the cuticle, or &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva into the &s;tomach. This contagion acts not by its be|ing ab&s;orbed into the circulation, but by the &s;ympathies, or a&s;&s;ociated actions, between the part fir&s;t &s;timulated by the contagious matter and the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. Thus in the natural &s;mall-pox the contagion is &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, and by its &s;timulus inflames the &s;tomach; this variolous inflammation of the &s;tomach increa&s;es every day, like the circle round the puncture of an inoculated arm, till it becomes great enough to di&s;order the circles of irritative and &s;en&s;itive motions, and thus produces fever fits, with &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting. La&s;tly, after the cold paroxy&s;m, or fit of torpor, of the &s;tomach has increa&s;ed for two or three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, an inflammation of the &s;kin commences in points; which generally fir&s;t appear upon the face, as the a&s;&s;ociated actions between the &s;kin of the face and that of the &s;to|mach have been more frequently exerted together than tho&s;e of any other parts of the external &s;urface.</P>
<P>Contagious matters, as tho&s;e of the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox, do not act upon the &s;y&s;tem at the &s;ame time; but the progre&s;s of that which was la&s;t received is delayed, till the action of the former infection cea&s;es. All kinds of matter, even that from common ulcers, are pro|bably contagious the fir&s;t time they are in&s;erted beneath the cuticle or &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach; that is, as they were formed by certain morbid actions of the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els, they have the power to excite &s;imilar morbid actions in the extremities of other ve&s;&s;els, to which they are applied; and the&s;e by &s;ympathy, or a&s;&s;ociations of motion, excite &s;imilar morbid actions in di&s;tant parts of the &s;y&s;tem, without entering the circulation; and hence the blood of a patient in the &s;mall-pox will not give that di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation to others.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="428">
When the new fibres or ve&s;&s;els become again ab&s;orbed into the cir|culation, the inflammation cea&s;es; which is promoted, after &s;ufficient evacuations, by external &s;timulants and bandages: but where the ac|tion of the ve&s;&s;els is very great, a mortification of the part is liable to en&s;ue, owing to the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power; which however occurs in weak people without much pain, and without very violent previous inflammation; and, like partial paraly&s;is, may be e&s;teemed one mode of natural death of old people, a part dying before the whole.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. BEFORE we commence this Section on Di&s;ea&s;ed Voluntary Motions, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that the word volition is not u&s;ed in this work exactly in its common acceptation. Volition is &s;aid in Section V. to bear the &s;ame analogy to de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, which &s;en&s;ation does to plea&s;ure and pain. And hence that, when de&s;ire or aver&s;ion produces any action of the mu&s;cular fibres, or of the organs of &s;en&s;e, they are termed volition; and the actions produced in con&s;equence are termed voluntary actions. Whence it appears, that motions of our mu&s;cles or ideas may be produced in con&s;equence of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion without our having the power to prevent them, and yet the&s;e motions may be termed voluntary, according to our definition of the word; though in common language they would be called involuntary.</P>
<P>The objects of de&s;ire and aver&s;ion are generally at a di&s;tance, where|as tho&s;e of plea&s;ure and pain are immediately acting upon our organs. Hence, before de&s;ire or aver&s;ion are exerted, &s;o as to cau&s;e any ac|tions, there is generally time for deliberation; which con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;|covering the means to obtain the object of de&s;ire, or to avoid the ob|ject of aver&s;ion; or in examining the good or bad con&s;equences, which may re&s;ult from them. In this ca&s;e it is evident, that we have a power to delay the propo&s;ed action, or to perform it; and this power of choo&s;ing, whether we &s;hall act or not, is in common language ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the word volition, or will. Whereas in this work the word volition means &s;imply the active &s;tate of the &s;en&s;orial faculty in producing motion in con&s;equence of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion; whether we have the power of re&s;training that action, or not; that is, whether we exert any actions in con&s;equence of oppo&s;ite de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, or not.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="431">
For if the objects of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion are pre&s;ent, there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ity to inve&s;tigate or compare the <HI>means</HI> of obtaining them, nor do we always deliberate about their con&s;equences; that is, no delibera|tion nece&s;&s;arily intervenes, and in con&s;equence the power of choo&s;ing to act or not is not exerted. It is probable, that this twofold u&s;e of the word volition in all languages has confounded the metaphy&s;icians, who have di&s;puted about free will and nece&s;&s;ity. Whereas from the above analy&s;is it would appear, that during our &s;leep, we u&s;e no vo|luntary exertions at all; and in our waking hours, that they are the con&s;equence of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>To will is to act in con&s;equence of de&s;ire; but to de&s;ire means to de&s;ire &s;omething, even if that &s;omething be only to become free from the pain, which cau&s;es the de&s;ire; for to de&s;ire nothing is not to de|&s;ire; the word de&s;ire, therefore, includes both the action and the ob|ject or motive; for the object and motive of de&s;ire are the &s;ame thing. Hence to de&s;ire without an object, that is, without a motive, is a &s;oleci&s;m in language. As if one &s;hould a&s;k, if you could eat without food, or breathe without air.</P>
<P>From this account of volition it appears, that convul&s;ions of the mu&s;cles, as in epileptic fits, may in the common &s;en&s;e of that word be termed involuntary; becau&s;e no deliberation is interpo&s;ed between the de&s;ire or aver&s;ion and the con&s;equent action; but in the &s;en&s;e of the word, as above defined, they belong to the cla&s;s of voluntary mo|tions, as delivered in Vol. II. Cla&s;s III. If this u&s;e of the word be di&s;cordant to the ear of the reader, the term morbid voluntary mo|tions, or motions in con&s;equence of aver&s;ion, may be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on has a de&s;ire to be cured of the ague, and has at the &s;ame time an aver&s;ion (or contrary de&s;ire) to &s;wallowing an ounce of Pe|ruvian bark; he balances de&s;ire again&s;t de&s;ire, or aver&s;ion again&s;t aver&s;ion; and thus he acquires the power of choo&s;ing, which is the common acceptation of the word <HI>willing.</HI> But in the cold fit of ague,
<PB N="418" REF="432">
after having di&s;covered that the act of &s;huddering, or exerting the &s;ub|cutaneous mu&s;cles, relieves the pain of cold; he immediately exerts this act of volition, and &s;hudders, as &s;oon as the pain and con&s;equent aver&s;ion return, without any deliberation intervening; yet is this act, as well as that of &s;wallowing an ounce of the bark, cau&s;ed by voli|tion; and that even though he endeavours in vain to prevent it by a weaker contrary volition. This recalls to our minds the &s;tory of the hungry a&s;s between two hay-&s;tacks, where the two de&s;ires are &s;up|po&s;ed &s;o exactly to counteract each other, that he goes to neither of the &s;tacks, but peri&s;hes by want. Now as two equal and oppo&s;ite de|&s;ires are thus &s;uppo&s;ed to balance each other, and prevent all action, it follows, that if one of the&s;e hay&s;tacks was &s;uddenly removed, that the a&s;s would irre&s;i&s;tibly be hurried to the other, which in the com|mon u&s;e of the word might be called an involuntary act; but which, in our acceptation of it, would be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t voluntary actions, as above explained.</P>
<P>Hence to deliberate is to compare oppo&s;ing de&s;ires or aver&s;ions, and that which is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting at length prevails, and produces ac|tion. Similar to this, where two pains oppo&s;e each other, the &s;tronger or more intere&s;ting one produces action; as in pleuri&s;y the pain from &s;uffocation would produce expan&s;ion of the lungs, but the pain occa|&s;ioned by extending the inflamed membrane, which lines the che&s;t, oppo&s;es this expan&s;ion, and one or the other alternately prevails.</P>
<P>When any one moves his hand quickly near another per&s;on's eyes, the eye-lids in&s;tantly clo&s;e; this act in common language is termed involuntary, as we have not time to deliberate or to exert any con|trary de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, but in this work it would be termed a volun|tary act, becau&s;e it is cau&s;ed by the faculty of volition, and after a few trials the nictitation can be prevented by a contrary or oppo&s;ing volition.</P>
<P>The power of oppo&s;ing volitions is be&s;t exemplified in the &s;tory of Mutius Scaevola, who is &s;aid to have thru&s;t his hand into the fire be|fore
<PB N="419" REF="433">
Porcenna, and to have &s;uffered it to be con&s;umed for having failed him in his attempt on the life of that general. Here the aver|&s;ion for the lo&s;s of fame, or the un&s;atisfied de&s;ire to &s;erve his country, the two prevalent enthu&s;ia&s;ms at that time, were more powerful than the de&s;ire of withdrawing his hand, which mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by the pain of combu&s;tion; of the&s;e oppo&s;ing volitions <Q><L>Vincit amor patriae, laudumque immen&s;a cupido.</L></Q></P>
<P>If any one is told not to &s;wallow his &s;aliva for a minute, he &s;oon &s;wallows it contrary to his will, in the common &s;en&s;e of that word; but this al&s;o is a voluntary action, as it is performed by the faculty of volition, and is thus to be under&s;tood. When the power of volition is exerted on any of our &s;en&s;es, they become more acute, as in our attempts to hear &s;mall noi&s;es in the night. As explained in Section XIX. 6. Hence by our attention to the fauces from our de&s;ire not to &s;wallow our &s;aliva; the fauces become more &s;en&s;ible; and the &s;timu|lus of the &s;aliva is followed by greater &s;en&s;ation, and con&s;equent de|&s;ire of &s;wallowing it. So that the de&s;ire or volition in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation of the &s;aliva is more powerful, than the previ|ous de&s;ire not to &s;wallow it. See Vol. II. Deglutitio invita. In the &s;ame manner if a mode&s;t man wi&s;hes not to want to make water, when he is confined with ladies in a coach or an a&s;&s;embly-room; that very act of volition induces the circum&s;tance, which he wi&s;hes to avoid, as above explained; in&s;omuch that I once &s;aw a partial in&s;a|nity, which might be called a voluntary diabetes, which was occa|&s;ioned by the fear (and con&s;equent aver&s;ion) of not being able to make water at all.</P>
<P>It is further nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, to prevent any confu&s;ion of voluntary, with &s;en&s;itive, or a&s;&s;ociate motions, that in all the in&s;tances of violent efforts to relieve pain, tho&s;e efforts are at fir&s;t voluntary exertions; but after they have been frequently repeated for the pur|po&s;e
<PB N="420" REF="434">
of relieving certain pains, they become a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e pains, and cea&s;e at tho&s;e times to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the will; as in coughing, &s;neezing, and &s;trangury. Of the&s;e motions tho&s;e which contribute to remove or di&s;lodge the offending cau&s;e, as the actions of the abdominal mu&s;cles in parturition or in vomiting, though they were originally excited by volition, are in this work termed &s;en&s;itive motions; but tho&s;e actions of the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e, which do not contribute to remove the offending cau&s;e, as in general convul|&s;ions or in madne&s;s, are in this work termed voluntary motions, or motions in con&s;equence of aver&s;ion, though in common language they are called involuntary ones. Tho&s;e &s;en&s;itive unre&s;trainable actions, which contribute to remove the cau&s;e of pain are uniformly and inva|riably exerted, as in coughing or &s;neezing; but tho&s;e motions which are exerted in con&s;equence of aver&s;ion without contributing to remove the painful cau&s;e, but only to prevent the &s;en&s;ation of it, as in epi|leptic, or cataleptic fits, are not uniformly and invariably exerted, but change from one &s;et of mu&s;cles to another, as will be further ex|plained; and may by this criterion al&s;o be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the former.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time tho&s;e motions, which are excited by perpetual &s;timulus, or by a&s;&s;ociation with each other, or immediately by plea|&s;ureable or painful &s;en&s;ation, may properly be termed involuntary mo|tions, as tho&s;e of the heart and arteries; as the faculty of volition &s;el|dom affects tho&s;e, except when it exi&s;ts in unnatural quantity, as in maniacal people.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was ob&s;erved in Section XIV. on the Production of Ideas, that tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which are u&s;ually termed the organs of &s;en&s;e, are liable to be excited into pain by the exce&s;s of the &s;timu|lus of tho&s;e objects, which are by nature adapted to affect them; as of too great light, &s;ound, or pre&s;&s;ure. But that the&s;e organs receive no pain from the defect or ab&s;ence of the&s;e &s;timuli, as in darkne&s;s or &s;ilence. But that our other organs of perception, which have gene|rally
<PB N="421" REF="435">
been called appetites, as of hunger, thir&s;t, want of heat, want of fre&s;h air, are liable to be affected with pain by the defect, as well as by the exce&s;s of their appropriated &s;timuli.</P>
<P>This exce&s;s or defect of &s;timulus is however to be con&s;idered only as the remote cau&s;e of the pain, the immediate cau&s;e being the exce&s;s or defect of the natural action of the affected part, according to Sect. IV. 5. Hence all the pains of the body may be divided into tho&s;e from exce&s;s of motion, and tho&s;e from defect of motion; which di&s;tinction is of great importance in the knowledge and the cure of many di&s;ea&s;es. For as the pains from exce&s;s of motion either gradually &s;ub&s;ide, or are in general &s;ucceeded by inflammation; &s;o tho&s;e from defect of motion either gradually &s;ub&s;ide, or are in general &s;ucceeded by convul&s;ion, or madne&s;s. The&s;e pains are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other by this circum&s;tance, that the former are attended with heat of the pain|ed part, or of the whole body; whereas the latter exi&s;ts without in|crea&s;e of heat in the pained part, and is generally attended with cold|ne&s;s of the extremities of the body; which is the true criterion of what have been called nervous pains.</P>
<P>Thus when any acrid material, as &s;nuff or lime, falls into the eye, pain and inflammation and heat are produced from the exce&s;s of &s;ti|mulus; but violent hunger, hemicrania, or the clavus hy&s;tericus, are attended with coldne&s;s of the extremities, and defect of circula|tion. When we are expo&s;ed to great cold, the pain we experience from the deficiency of heat is attended with a quie&s;cence of the mo|tions of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem; &s;o that no inflammation is produced, but a great de&s;ire of heat, and a tremulous motion of the &s;ubcutaneous mu&s;cles, which is properly a convul&s;ion in con&s;equence of this pain from defect of the &s;timulus of heat.</P>
<P>It was before mentioned, that as &s;en&s;ation con&s;i&s;ts in certain move|ments of the &s;en&s;orium, beginning at &s;ome of the extremities of it, and propagated to the central parts of it; &s;o volition con&s;i&s;ts of cer|tain other movements of the &s;en&s;orium, commencing in the central
<PB N="422" REF="436">
parts of it, and propagated to &s;ome of its extremities. This idea of the&s;e two great powers of motion in the animal machine is confirmed from ob&s;erving, that they never exi&s;t in a great degree or univer&s;ally at the &s;ame time; for while we &s;trongly exert our voluntary motions, we cea&s;e to &s;eel the pains or unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, which occa&s;ioned us to exert them.</P>
<P>Hence during the time of fighting with fi&s;ts or &s;words no pain is felt by the combatants, till they cea&s;e to exert them&s;elves. Thus in the beginning of ague-fits the painful &s;en&s;ation of cold is dimini&s;hed, while the patient exerts him&s;elf in the &s;hivering and gna&s;hing of his teeth. He then cea&s;es to exert him&s;elf, and the pain of cold returns; and he is thus perpetually induced to reiterate the&s;e exertions, from which he experiences a temporary relief. The &s;ame occurs in labour|pains, the exertion of the parturient woman relieves the violence of the pains for a time, which recur again &s;oon after &s;he has cea&s;ed to u&s;e tho&s;e exertions. The &s;ame is true in many other painful di&s;ea&s;es, as in the &s;trangury, tene&s;mus, and the efforts of vomiting; all the&s;e di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations are dimini&s;hed or removed for a time by the various exertions they occa&s;ion, and recur alternately with tho&s;e ex|ertions.</P>
<P>The re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in &s;ome fevers is an almo&s;t perpetual exertion of this kind, excited to relieve &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations; the recipro|cal oppo&s;ite exertions of a wounded worm, the alternate empro&s;tho|tonos and opi&s;thotonos of &s;ome &s;pa&s;modic di&s;ea&s;es, and the intervals of all convul&s;ions, from whatever cau&s;e, &s;eem to be owing to this cir|cum&s;tance of the laws of animation; that great or univer&s;al exertion cannot exi&s;t at the &s;ame time with great or univer&s;al &s;en&s;ation, though they can exi&s;t reciprocally; which is probably re&s;olvable into the more general law, that the whole &s;en&s;orial power being expanded in one mode of exertion, there is none to &s;pare for any other. Whence &s;yncope, or temporary apoplexy, &s;ucceeds to epileptic convul|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="423" REF="437">
3. Hence when any violent pain afflicts us, of which we can nei|ther avoid nor remove the cau&s;e, we &s;oon learn to endeavour to alle|viate it, by exerting &s;ome violent voluntary effort, as mentioned above; and are naturally induced to u&s;e tho&s;e mu&s;cles for this pur|po&s;e, which have been in the early periods of our lives mo&s;t frequent|ly or mo&s;t powerfully exerted.</P>
<P>Now the fir&s;t mu&s;cles, which infants u&s;e mo&s;t frequently, are tho&s;e of re&s;piration; and on this account we gain a habit of holding our breath, at the &s;ame time that we u&s;e great efforts to exclude it, for this purpo&s;e of alleviating unavoidable pain; or we pre&s;s out our breath through a &s;mall aperture of the larinx, and &s;cream violently, when the pain is greater than is relievable by the former mode of ex|ertion. Thus children &s;cream to relieve any pain either of body or mind, as from anger, or fear of being beaten.</P>
<P>Hence it is curious to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e animals, who have more frequently exerted their mu&s;cles of re&s;piration violently, as in talking, barking, or grunting, as children, dogs, hogs, &s;cream much more, when they are in pain, than tho&s;e other animals, who u&s;e little or no language in their common modes of life; as hor&s;es, &s;heep, and cows.</P>
<P>The next mo&s;t frequent or mo&s;t powerful efforts, which infants are fir&s;t tempted to produce, are tho&s;e with the mu&s;cles in biting hard &s;ub&s;tances: indeed the exertion of the&s;e mu&s;cles is very powerful in common ma&s;tication, as appears from the pain we receive, if a bit of bone is unexpectedly found among&s;t our &s;ofter food; and further ap|pears from their acting to &s;o great mechanical di&s;advantage, particu|larly when we bite with the inci&s;ores, or canine teeth; which are fir&s;t formed, and thence are fir&s;t u&s;ed to violent exertion.</P>
<P>Hence when a per&s;on is in great pain, the cau&s;e of which he can|not remove, he &s;ets his teeth firmly together, or bites &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance between them with great vehemence, as another mode of violent ex|ertion to produce a temporary relief. Thus we have a proverb where
<PB N="424" REF="438">
no help can be had in pain, "to grin and abide;" and the tortures of hell are &s;aid to be attended with "gna&s;hing of teeth."</P>
<P>Hence in violent &s;pa&s;modic pains I have &s;een people bite not only their tongues, but their arms or fingers, or tho&s;e of the attendants, or any object which was near them; and al&s;o &s;trike, pinch, or tear, others or them&s;elves, particularly the part of their own body, which is painful at the time. Soldiers, who die of painful wounds in battle, are &s;aid by Homer to bite the ground. Thus al&s;o in the bellon, or colica &s;aturnina, the patients are &s;aid to bite their own fle&s;h, and dogs in this di&s;ea&s;e to bite up the ground they lie upon. It is pro|bable that the great endeavours to bite in mad dogs, and the violence of other mad animals, is owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the efforts of our voluntary motions are exerted with &s;till greater energy for the relief of &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, convul|&s;ions are produced; as the various kinds of epilep&s;y, and in &s;ome hy&s;|teric paroxi&s;ms. In all the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es a pain or di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is produced, frequently by worms, or acidity in the bowels, or by a di&s;ea&s;ed nerve in the &s;ide, or head, or by the pain of a di&s;ea&s;ed liver.</P>
<P>In &s;ome con&s;titutions a more intolerable degree of pain is produced in &s;ome part at a di&s;tance from the cau&s;e by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, as before explained; the&s;e pains in &s;uch con&s;titutions ari&s;e to &s;o great a degree, that I verily believe no artificial tortures could equal &s;ome, which I have witne&s;&s;ed; and am confident life would not have long been pre&s;erved, unle&s;s they had been &s;oon dimini&s;hed or removed by the univer&s;al convul&s;ion of the voluntary motions, or by temporary madne&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the unfortunate patients I have ob&s;erved, the pain has ri&s;en to an inexpre&s;&s;ible degree, as above de&s;cribed, before the con|vul&s;ions have &s;upervened; and which were preceded by &s;creaming, and grinning; in others, as in the common epilep&s;y, the convul&s;ion has immediately &s;ucceeded the commencement of the di&s;agreeable
<PB N="425" REF="439">
&s;en&s;ations; and as a &s;tupor frequently &s;ucceeds the convul&s;ions, they only &s;eemed to remember that a pain at the &s;tomach preceded the fit, or &s;ome other unea&s;y feel; or more frequently retained no memory at all of the immediate cau&s;e of the paroxy&s;m. But even in this kind of epilep&s;y, where the patient does not recollect any preceding pain, the paroxi&s;ms generally are preceded by a quivering motion of the under jaw, with a biting of the tongue; the teeth afterwards become pre&s;&s;ed together with vehemence, and the eyes are then convul&s;ed, before the commencement of the univer&s;al convul&s;ion; which are all efforts to relieve pain.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the&s;e convul&s;ive motions are alternately exerted and remitted was mentioned above, and in Sect. XII. 1. 3. when the exertions are &s;uch as give a temporary relief to the pain, which ex|cites them, they cea&s;e for a time, till the pain is again perceived; and then new exertions are produced for its relief. We &s;ee daily examples of this in the loud reiterated laughter of &s;ome people; the plea&s;ure|able &s;en&s;ation, which excites this laughter, ari&s;es for a time &s;o high as to change its name and become painful: the convul&s;ive motions of the re&s;piratory mu&s;cles relieve the pain for a time; we are, however, unwilling to lo&s;e the plea&s;ure, and pre&s;ently put a &s;top to this ex|ertion, and immediately the plea&s;ure recurs, and again as in&s;tantly ri&s;es into pain. All of us have felt the pain of immoderate laughter; children have been tickled into convul&s;ions of the whole body; and others have died in the act of laughing; probably from a paraly&s;is &s;ucceeding the long continued actions of the mu&s;cles of re&s;pira|tion.</P>
<P>Hence we learn the rea&s;on, why children, who are &s;o ea&s;ily ex|cited to laugh by the tickling of other people's fingers, cannot tickle them&s;elves into laughter. The exertion of their hands in the en|deavour to tickle them&s;elves prevents the nece&s;&s;ity of any exertion of the re&s;piratory mu&s;cles to relieve the exce&s;s of plea&s;ureable affection. See Sect. XVII. 3. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="440">
Chry&s;ippus is recorded to have died laughing, when an a&s;s was in|vited to &s;up with him. The &s;ame is related of one of the popes, who, when he was ill, &s;aw a tame monkey at his bed&s;ide put on the holy thiara. Hall. Phy&s;. T. III. p. 306.</P>
<P>There are in&s;tances of epilep&s;y being produced by laughing recorded by Van Swieton, T. III. 402 and 308. And it is well known, that many people have died in&s;tantaneou&s;ly from the painful exce&s;s of joy, which probably might have been prevented by the exertions of laughter.</P>
<P>Every combination of ideas, which we attend to, occa&s;ions pain or plea&s;ure; tho&s;e which occa&s;ion plea&s;ure, furni&s;h either &s;ocial or &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ure, either malicious or friendly, or la&s;civious, or &s;ublime plea|&s;ure; that is, they give us plea&s;ure mixed with other emotions, or they give us unmixed plea&s;ure, without occa&s;ioning any other emo|tions or exertions at the &s;ame time. This unmixed plea&s;ure, if it be great, becomes painful, like all other animal motions from &s;timuli of every kind; and if no other exertions are occa&s;ioned at the &s;ame time, we u&s;e the exertion of laughter to relieve this pain. Hence laughter is occa&s;ioned by &s;uch wit as excites &s;imple plea&s;ure without any other emotion, &s;uch as pity, love, reverence. For &s;ublime ideas are mixed with admiration, beautiful ones with love, new ones with &s;urpri&s;e; and the&s;e exertions of our ideas prevent the action of laugh|ter from being nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the painful plea&s;ure above de&s;cribed. Whence laughable wit con&s;i&s;ts of &s;rivolous ideas, without connections of any con&s;equence, &s;uch as puns on words, or on phra&s;es, incon|gruous junctions of ideas; on which account laughter is &s;o frequent in children.</P>
<P>Unmixed plea&s;ure le&s;s than that, which cau&s;es laughter, cau&s;es &s;leep, as in &s;inging children to &s;leep, or in &s;light intoxication from wine or food. See Sect. XVIII. 12.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the pains, or di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, above de&s;cribed do not obtain a temporary relief from the&s;e convul&s;ive exertions of the mu&s;|cles,
<PB N="427" REF="441">
tho&s;e convul&s;ive exertions continue without remi&s;&s;ion, and one kind of catalep&s;y is produced. Thus when a nerve or tendon pro|duces great pain by its being inflamed or wounded, the patient &s;ets his teeth firmly together, and grins violently, to dimini&s;h the pain; and if the pain is not relieved by this exertion, no relaxation of the maxillary mu&s;cles takes place, as in the convul&s;ions above de&s;cribed, but the jaws remain firmly fixed together. This locked jaw is the mo&s;t frequent in&s;tance of cataleptic &s;pa&s;m, becau&s;e we are more in|clined to exert the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to ma&s;tication from their early obedience to violent efforts of volition.</P>
<P>But in the ca&s;e related in Sect. XIX. on Reverie, the cataleptic lady had pain in her upper teeth; and pre&s;&s;ing one of her hands ve|hemently again&s;t her cheek-bone to dimini&s;h this pain, it remained in that attitude for about half an hour twice a day, till the painful pa|roxy&s;m was over.</P>
<P>I have this very day &s;een a young lady in this di&s;ea&s;e, (with which &s;he has frequently been afflicted,) &s;he began to-day with violent pain &s;hooting from one &s;ide of the forehead to the occiput, and after various &s;truggles lay on the bed with her fingers and wri&s;ts bent and &s;tiff for about two hours; in other re&s;pects &s;he &s;eemed in a &s;yncope with a natural pul&s;e. She then had intervals of pain and of &s;pa&s;m, and took three grains of opium every hour till &s;he had taken nine grains, before the pains and &s;pa&s;m cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is, however, another &s;pecies of fixed &s;pa&s;m, which differs from the former, as the pain exi&s;ts in the contracted mu&s;cle, and would &s;eem rather to be the con&s;equence than the cau&s;e of the con|traction, as in the cramp in the calf of the leg, and in many other parts of the body.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;pa&s;ms it &s;hould &s;eem, that the mu&s;cle it&s;elf is fir&s;t thrown into contraction by &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, as of cold; and that then the violent pain is produced by the great contraction of the mu&s;|cular
<PB N="428" REF="442">
fibres extending its own tendons, which are &s;aid to be &s;en&s;ible to exten&s;ion only; and is further explained in Sect. XVIII. 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. Many in&s;tances have been given in this work, where after vio|lent motions excited by irritation, the organ has become quie&s;cent to le&s;s, and even to the great irritation, which induced it into violent motion; as after looking long at the &s;un or any bright colour, they cea&s;e to be &s;een; and after removing from bright day-light into a gloomy room, the eye cannot at fir&s;t perceive the objects, which &s;ti|mulate it le&s;s. Similar to this is the &s;yncope, which &s;ucceeds after the violent exertions of our voluntary motions, as after epileptic fits, for the power of volition acts in this ca&s;e as the &s;timulus in the other. This &s;yncope is a temporary pal&s;y, or apoplexy, which cea&s;es after a time, the mu&s;cles recovering their power of being excited into action by the efforts of volition; as the eye in the circum&s;tance above men|tioned recovers in a little time its power of &s;eeing objects in a gloomy room; which were invi&s;ible immediately after coming out of a &s;tronger light. This is owing to an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the inaction of tho&s;e fibres, which were before accu&s;tomed to per|petual exertions, as explained in Sect. XII. 7. 1. A &s;lighter degree of this di&s;ea&s;e is experienced by every one after great fatigue, when the mu&s;cles gain &s;uch inability to further action, that we are obliged to re&s;t them for a while, or to &s;ummon a greater power of volition to continue their motions.</P>
<P>In all the &s;yncopes, which I have &s;een induced after convul&s;ive fits, the pul&s;e has continued natural, though the organs of &s;en&s;e as well as the locomotive mu&s;cles, have cea&s;ed to perform their functions; for it is nece&s;&s;ary for the perception of objects, that the external organs of &s;en&s;e &s;hould be properly excited by the voluntary power, as the eye-lids mu&s;t be open, and perhaps the mu&s;cles of the eye put into action to di&s;tend, and thence give greater pellucidity to the cornea, which in &s;yncope, as in death, appears flat and le&s;s tran&s;parent.
<PB N="429" REF="443">
The tympanum of the ear al&s;o &s;eems to require a voluntary exertion of its mu&s;cles, to gain its due ten&s;ion, and it is probable the other external organs of &s;en&s;e require a &s;imilar voluntary exertion to adapt them to the di&s;tinct perception of objects. Hence in &s;yncope as in &s;leep, as the power of volition is &s;u&s;pended, no external objects are perceived. See Sect. XVIII. 5. During the time which the patient lies in a fainting fit, the &s;pirit of animation becomes accumulated; and hence the mu&s;cles in a while become irritable by their u&s;ual &s;ti|mulation, and the fainting fit cea&s;es. See Sect. XII. 7. 1.</P>
<P N="7">7. If the exertion of the voluntary motions has been &s;till more energetic, the quie&s;cence, which &s;ucceeds, is &s;o complete, that they cannot again be excited into action by the efforts of the will. In this manner the pal&s;y, and apoplexy (which is an univer&s;al pal&s;y) are fre|quently produced after convul&s;ions, or other violent exertions; of this I &s;hall add a few in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Platernus mentions &s;ome, who have died apoplectic from violent exertions in dancing; and Dr. Mead, in his E&s;&s;ay on Poi&s;ons, records a patient in the hydrophobia, who at one effort broke the cords which bound him, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant expired. And it is pro|bable, that tho&s;e, who have expired from immoderate laughter, have died from this paraly&s;is con&s;equent to violent exertion. Mrs. Scott of Stafford was walking in her garden in perfect health with her neigh|bour Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; the latter accidentally fell into a muddy rivulet, and tried in vain to di&s;engage her&s;elf by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mrs. Scott's hand. Mrs. Scott exerted her utmo&s;t power for many minutes, fir&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t her friend, and next to prevent her&s;elf from being pulled into the mora&s;s, as her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed companion would not di&s;engage her hand. After other a&s;&s;i&s;tance was procured by their united &s;creams, Mrs. Scott walked to a chair about twenty yards from the brook, and was &s;eized with an apoplectic &s;troke; which continued many days, and terminated in a total lo&s;s of her right arm, and her &s;peech; neither of which &s;he ever after perfectly recovered.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="444">
It is &s;aid, that many people in Holland have died after &s;kating too long or too violently on their frozen canals; it is probable the death of the&s;e, and of others, who have died &s;uddenly in &s;wimming, has been owing to this great quie&s;cence or paraly&s;is; which has &s;ucceeded very violent exertions, added to the concomitant cold, which has had greater effect after the &s;ufferers had been heated and exhau&s;ted by pre|vious exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>I remember a young man of the name of Nairne at Cambridge, who walking on the edge of a barge fell into the river. His cou&s;in and fellow-&s;tudent of the &s;ame name, knowing the other could not &s;wim, plunged into the water after him, caught him by his clothes, and approaching the bank by a vehement exertion propelled him &s;afe to the land, but that in&s;tant, &s;eized, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the cramp, or paraly&s;is, &s;unk to ri&s;e no more. The rea&s;on why the cramp of the mu&s;cles, which compo&s;e the calf of the leg, is &s;o liable to affect &s;wimmers, is, becau&s;e the&s;e mu&s;cles have very weak antagoni&s;ts, and are in walking generally elongated again after their contraction by the weight of the body on the ball of the toe, which is very much greater than the re&s;i&s;tance of the water in &s;wimming. See Section XVIII. 15.</P>
<P>It does not follow that every apoplectic or paralytic attack is im|mediately preceded by vehement exertion; the quie&s;cence, which &s;ucceeds exertion, and which is not &s;o great as to be termed paraly&s;is, frequently recurs afterwards at certain periods; and by other cau&s;es of quie&s;cence, occurring with tho&s;e periods, as was explained in treat|ing of the paroxy&s;ms of intermitting fevers; the quie&s;cence at length becomes &s;o great as to be incapable of again being removed by the efforts of volition, and complete paraly&s;is is formed. See Section XXXII. 3. 2.</P>
<P>Many of the paralytic patients, whom I have &s;een, have evidently had di&s;ea&s;ed livers from the too frequent potation of &s;pirituous liquors; &s;ome of them have had the gutta ro&s;ea on their faces and brea&s;ts;
<PB N="431" REF="445">
which has in &s;ome degree receded either &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or by the u&s;e of external remedies, and the paralytic &s;troke has &s;ucceeded; and as in &s;everal per&s;ons, who have drank much vinous &s;pirits, I have ob|&s;erved epileptic fits to commence at about forty or fifty years of age, without any hereditary taint, from the &s;timulus, as I believed, of a di&s;ea&s;ed liver; I was induced to a&s;cribe many paralytic ca&s;es to the &s;ame &s;ource; which were not evidently the effect of age, or of un|acquired debility. And the account given before of drop&s;ies, which very frequently are owing to a paraly&s;is of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and are generally attendant on free drinkers of &s;pirituous liquors, con|firmed me in this opinion.</P>
<P>The di&s;agreeable irritation of a di&s;ea&s;ed liver produces exertions and con&s;equent quie&s;cence; the&s;e by the accidental concurrence of other cau&s;es of quie&s;cence, as cold, &s;olar or lunar periods, inanition, the want of their u&s;ual portion of &s;pirit of wine, at length produces pa|raly&s;is.</P>
<P>This is further confirmed by ob&s;erving, that the mu&s;cles, we mo&s;t frequently, or mo&s;t powerfully exert, are mo&s;t liable to pal&s;y; as tho&s;e of the voice and of articulation, and of tho&s;e paralytics which I have &s;een, a much greater proportion have lo&s;t the u&s;e of their right arm; which is &s;o much more generally exerted than the left.</P>
<P>I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without ob&s;erving, that after a para|lytic &s;troke, if the vital powers are not much injured, that the pa|tient has all the movements of the affected limb to learn over again, ju&s;t as in early infancy; the limb is fir&s;t moved by the irritation of its mu&s;cles, as in &s;tretching, (of which a ca&s;e was related in Section VII. 1. 3.) or by the electric concu&s;&s;ion; afterwards it becomes obedient to &s;en&s;ation, as in violent danger or fear; and la&s;tly, the mu&s;cles become again a&s;&s;ociated with volition, and gradually acquire their u&s;ual habits of acting together.</P>
<P>Another phaenomenon in pal&s;ies is, that when the limbs of one &s;ide
<PB N="432" REF="446">
are di&s;abled, tho&s;e of the other are in perpetual motion. This can only be explained from conceiving that the power of motion, what|ever it is, or wherever it re&s;ides, and which is capable of being ex|hau&s;ted by fatigue, and accumulated in re&s;t, is now le&s;s expended, whil&s;t one half of the body is incapable of receiving its u&s;ual propor|tion of it, and is hence derived with greater ea&s;e or in greater abundance into the limbs, which remain unaffected.</P>

<P N="1">II. 1. The exce&s;s or defect of voluntary exertion produces &s;imilar effects upon the &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas of the mind, as tho&s;e al|ready mentioned upon the mu&s;cular fibres. Thus when any violent pain, ari&s;ing from the defect of &s;ome peculiar &s;timulus, exi&s;ts either in the mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual &s;y&s;tems of fibres, and which cannot be removed by acquiring the defective &s;timulus; as in &s;ome con&s;titutions convul&s;ions of the mu&s;cles are produced to procure a temporary relief, &s;o in other con&s;titutions vehement voluntary exertions of the ideas of the mind are produced for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; for during this exertion, like that of the mu&s;cles, the pain either vani&s;hes or is dimini&s;hed: this violent exertion con&s;titutes madne&s;s; and in many ca&s;es I have &s;een the madne&s;s take place, and the convul&s;ions cea&s;e, and recipro|cally the madne&s;s cea&s;e, and the convul&s;ions &s;upervene. See Section III. 5. 8.</P>
<P N="2">2. Madne&s;s is di&s;tingui&s;hable from delirium, as in the latter the patient knows not the place where he re&s;ides, nor the per&s;ons of his friends or attendants, nor is con&s;cious of any external objects, except when &s;poken to with a louder voice, or &s;timulated with unu&s;ual force, and even then he &s;oon relap&s;es into a &s;tate of inattention to every thing about him. Whil&s;t in the former he is perfectly &s;en&s;ible to every thing external, but has the voluntary powers of his mind in|ten&s;ely exerted on &s;ome particular object of his de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, he harbours in his thoughts a &s;u&s;picion of all mankind, le&s;t they &s;hould counteract his de&s;igns; and while he keeps his intentions, and the
<PB N="433" REF="447">
motives of his actions profoundly &s;ecret; he is perpetually &s;tudying the means of acquiring the object of his wi&s;h, or of preventing or re|venging the injuries he &s;u&s;pects.</P>
<P N="3">3. A late French philo&s;opher, Mr. Helvetius, has deduced almo&s;t all our actions from this principle of their relieving us from the ennui or taedium vitae; and true it is, that our de&s;ires or aver&s;ions are the motives of all our voluntary actions; and human nature &s;eems to ex|cel other animals in the more facil u&s;e of this voluntary power, and on that account is more liable to in&s;anity than other animals. But in mania this violent exertion of volition is expended on mi&s;taken ob|jects, and would not be relieved, though we were to gain or e&s;cape the objects, that excite it. Thus I have &s;een two in&s;tances of mad|men, who conceived that they had the itch, and &s;everal have believed they had the venereal infection, without in reality having a &s;ymptom of either of them. They have been perpetually thinking upon this &s;ubject, and &s;ome of them were in vain &s;alivated with de&s;ign of con|vincing them to the contrary.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the minds of mad people tho&s;e volitions alone exi&s;t, which are unmixed with &s;en&s;ation; immoderate &s;u&s;picion is generally the fir&s;t &s;ymptom, and want of &s;hame, and want of delicacy about clean|line&s;s. Su&s;picion is a voluntary exertion of the mind ari&s;ing from the pain of fear, which it is exerted to relieve: &s;hame is the name of a peculiar di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, &s;ee Fable of the Bees, and delicacy about cleanline&s;s ari&s;es from another di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation. And therefore are not found in the minds of maniacs, which are employed &s;olely in voluntary exertions. Hence the mo&s;t mode&s;t women in this di&s;ea&s;e walk naked among&s;t men without any kind of concern, u&s;e ob&s;cene di&s;cour&s;e, and have no delicacy about their natural eva|cuations.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nor are maniacal people more attentive to their natural appe|tites, or to the irritations which &s;urround them, except as far as may re&s;pect their &s;u&s;picions or de&s;igns; for the violent and perpetual ex|ertions
<PB N="434" REF="448">
of their voluntary powers of mind prevents their perception of almo&s;t every other object, either of irritation or of &s;en&s;ation. Hence it is that they bear cold, hunger, and fatigue, with much greater pertinacity than in their &s;ober hours, and are le&s;s injured by them in re&s;pect to their general health. Thus it is a&s;&s;erted by hi&s;torians, that Charles the Twelfth of Sweden &s;lept on the &s;now, wrapped only in his cloak, at the &s;iege of Frederick&s;tad, and bore extremes of cold, and hunger, and fatigue, under which numbers of his &s;oldiers peri&s;h|ed; becau&s;e the king was in&s;ane with ambition, but the &s;oldier had no &s;uch powerful &s;timulus to pre&s;erve his &s;y&s;tem from debility and death.</P>
<P N="6">6. Be&s;ides the in&s;anities ari&s;ing from exertions in con&s;equence of pain, there is al&s;o a plea&s;ureable in&s;anity, as well as a plea&s;ureable delirium; as the in&s;anity of per&s;onal vanity, and that of religious fa|natici&s;m. When agreeable ideas excite into motion the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, and this again cau&s;es other trains of agreeable ideas, a con&s;tant &s;tream of plea&s;ureable ideas &s;ucceeds, and produces plea&s;ureable delirium. So when the &s;en&s;orial power of volition ex|cites agreeable ideas, and the plea&s;ure thus produced excites more vo|lition in its turn, a con&s;tant flow of agreeable voluntary ideas &s;uc|ceeds; which when thus exerted in the extreme con&s;titutes in|&s;anity.</P>
<P>Thus when our mu&s;cular actions are excited by our &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, it is termed play; when they are excited by our volition, it is termed work; and the former of the&s;e is attended with le&s;s fa|tigue, becau&s;e the mu&s;cular actions in play produce in their turn more plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation; which again has the property of pro|ducing more mu&s;cular action. An agreeable in&s;tance of this I &s;aw this morning. A little boy, who was tired with walking, begged of his papa to carry him. "Here," &s;ays the reverend doctor, "ride upon my gold-headed cane;" and the plea&s;ed child, putting it be|tween his legs, gallopped away with delight, and complained no
<PB N="435" REF="449">
more of his fatigue. Here the aid of another &s;en&s;orial power, that of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, &s;uperadded vigour to the exertion of exhau&s;ted volition. Which could otherwi&s;e only have been excited by additional pain, as by the la&s;h of &s;lavery. On this account where the whole &s;en&s;orial power has been exerted on the contemplation of the promi&s;ed joys of heaven, the &s;aints of all per&s;ecuted religions have borne the tortures of martyrdom with otherwi&s;e unaccountable firmne&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. There are &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, which obtain at lea&s;t a temporary relief from the exertions of in&s;anity; many in&s;tances of drop&s;ies being thus for a time cured are recorded. An elderly woman labouring with a&s;cites I twice &s;aw relieved for &s;ome weeks by in&s;anity, the drop&s;y cea&s;ed for &s;everal weeks, and recurred again alternating with the in|&s;anity. A man afflicted with difficult re&s;piration on lying down, with very irregular pul&s;e, and oedematous legs, whom I &s;aw this day, has for above a week been much relieved in re&s;pect to all tho&s;e &s;ymptoms by the acce&s;&s;ion of in&s;anity, which is &s;hewn by inordinate &s;u&s;picion, and great anger.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of common temporary anger the increa&s;ed action of the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem is &s;een by the red &s;kin, and increa&s;ed pul&s;e, with the immediate increa&s;e of mu&s;cular activity. A friend of mine, when he was painfully fatigued by riding on hor&s;eback, was accu&s;tomed to call up ideas into his mind, which u&s;ed to excite his anger or indignation, and thus for a time at lea&s;t relieved the pain of fatigue. By this tempo|rary in&s;anity, the effect of the voluntary power upon the whole of his &s;y&s;tem was increa&s;ed; as in the ca&s;es of drop&s;y above mentioned, it would appear, that the increa&s;ed action of the voluntary faculty of the &s;en&s;orium affected the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, as well as the &s;ecerning one.</P>
<P N="8">8. In re&s;pect to relieving inflammatory pains, and removing fever, I have &s;een many in&s;tances, as mentioned in Sect. XII. 2. 4. One lady, whom I attended, had twice at &s;ome years interval a locked
<PB N="436" REF="450">
jaw, which relieved a pain on her &s;ternum with peripneumony. Two other ladies I &s;aw, who towards the end of violent peripneumony, in which they frequently lo&s;t blood, were at length cured by in&s;anity &s;upervening. In the former the increa&s;ed voluntary exertion of the mu&s;cles of the jaw, in the latter that of the organs of &s;en&s;e, removed the di&s;ea&s;e; that is, the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which had produced the inflammation, now excited the voluntary power, and the&s;e new voluntary exertions employed or expended the &s;uperabundant &s;en&s;orial power, which had previou&s;ly been exerted on the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and cau&s;ed inflammation.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e, which I think worth relating, was of a young man about twenty; he had laboured under an irritative fever with debility for three or four weeks, with very quick and very feeble pul&s;e, and other u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of that &s;pecies of typhus, but at this time com|plained much and frequently of pain of his legs and feet. When tho&s;e who attended him were nearly in de&s;pair of his recovery, I ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure an in&s;anity of mind &s;upervene: which was totally dif|ferent from delirium, as he knew his friends, calling them by their names, and the room in which he lay, but became violently &s;u&s;pici|ous of his attendants, and calumniated with vehement oaths his ten|der mother, who &s;at weeping by his bed. On this his pul&s;e became flower and &s;irmer, but the quickne&s;s did not for &s;ome time intirely cea&s;e, and he gradually recovered. In this ca&s;e the introduction of an increa&s;ed quantity of the power of volition gave vigour to tho&s;e move|ments of the &s;y&s;tem, which are generally only actuated by the power of irritation, and of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e I recollect of a young man, about twenty-five, who had the fcarlet-fever, with very quick pul&s;e, and an univer&s;al erup|tion on his &s;kin, and was not without rea&s;on e&s;teemed to be in great danger of his life. After a few days an in&s;anity &s;upervened, which his friends mi&s;took for delirium, and he gradually recovered, and the
<PB N="437" REF="451">
cuticle peeled off. From the&s;e and a few other ca&s;es I have always e&s;teemed in&s;anity to be a favourable &s;ign in fevers, and have cautiou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed it from delirium.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>III. Another mode of mental exertion to relieve pain, is by pro|ducing a train of ideas not only by the efforts of volition, as in in&s;a|nity; but by tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ation likewi&s;e, as in delirium and &s;leep. This mental effort is termed reverie, or &s;omnambulation, and is de|&s;cribed more at large in Sect. XIX. on that &s;ubject. But I &s;hall here relate another ca&s;e of that wonderful di&s;ea&s;e, which fell ye&s;terday under my eye, and to which I have &s;een many analogous alienations of mind, though not exactly &s;imilar in all circum&s;tances. But as all of them either began or terminated with pain or convul&s;ion, there can be no doubt but that they are of epileptic origin, and con&s;titute another mode of mental exertion to relieve &s;ome painful &s;en|&s;ation.</P>
<P N="1">1. Ma&s;ter A. about nine years old, had been &s;eized at &s;even every morning for ten days with uncommon fits, and had had &s;light re|turns in the afternoon. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to originate from worms, and had been in vain attempted to be removed by vermi|fuge purges. As his fit was expected at &s;even ye&s;terday morning, I &s;aw him before that hour; he was a&s;leep, &s;eemed free from pain, and his pul&s;e natural. About &s;even he began to complain of pain about his navel, or more to the left &s;ide, and in a few minutes had exertions of his arms and legs like &s;wimming. He then for half an hour hunted a pack of hounds; as appeared by his hallooing, and calling the dogs by their names, and di&s;cour&s;ing with the at|tendants of the cha&s;e, de&s;cribing exactly a day of hunting, which (I was informed) he had witne&s;&s;ed a year before, going through all the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances of it; calling to people, who were then pre&s;ent, and lamenting the ab&s;ence of others, who were then al&s;o ab&s;ent. After this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> he imitated, as he lay in bed,
<PB N="438" REF="452">
&s;ome of the plays of boys, as &s;wimming and jumping. He then &s;ung an Engli&s;h and then an Italian &s;ong; part of which with his eyes open, and part with them clo&s;ed, but could not be awakened or excited by any violence, which it was proper to u&s;e.</P>
<P>After about an hour he came &s;uddenly to him&s;elf with ap|parent &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;eemed quite ignorant of any part of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and after being apparently well for half an hour, he &s;uddenly fell into a great &s;tupor, with &s;lower pul&s;e than natural, and a &s;low moaning re&s;piration, in which he continued about another half hour, and then recovered.</P>
<P>The &s;equel of this di&s;ea&s;e was favourable; he was directed one grain of opium at &s;ix every morning, and then to ri&s;e out of bed; at half pa&s;t &s;ix he was directed fifteen drops of laudanum in a gla&s;s of wine and water. The fir&s;t day the paroxy&s;m became &s;horter, and le&s;s violent. The do&s;e of opium was increa&s;ed to one|half more, and in three or four days the fits left him. The bark and filings of iron were al&s;o exhibited twice a day; and I believe the com|plaint returned no more.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this paroxy&s;m it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that he began with pain, and ended with &s;tupor, in both circum&s;tances re&s;embling a fit of epilep&s;y. And that therefore the exertions both of mind and body, both the vo|luntary ones, and tho&s;e immediately excited by plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, were exertions to relieve pain.</P>
<P>The hunting &s;cene appeared to be rather an act of memory than of imagination, and was therefore rather a voluntary exer|tion, though attended with the plea&s;ureable eagerne&s;s, which was the con&s;equence of tho&s;e ideas recalled by recollection, and not the cau&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas thus voluntarily recollected were &s;ucceeded by &s;en|&s;ations of plea&s;ure, though his &s;en&s;es were unaffected by the &s;ti|muli
<PB N="439" REF="453">
of vi&s;ible or audible objects; or &s;o weakly excited by them as not to produce &s;en&s;ation or attention. And the plea&s;ure thus ex|cited by volition produced other ideas and other motions in con|&s;equence of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation. Whence the mixed catenations of voluntary and &s;en&s;itive ideas and mu&s;cular motions in reverie; which, like every other kind of vehement exertion, contribute to relieve pain, by expending a large quantity of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fits generally commence during &s;leep, from whence I &s;up|po&s;e they have been thought to have &s;ome connection with &s;leep, and have thence been termed Somnambali&s;m; but their commence|ment during &s;leep is owing to our increa&s;ed excitability by internal &s;en&s;ations at that time, as explained in Sect. XVIII. 14 and 15, and not to any &s;imilitude between reverie and &s;leep.</P>
<P N="3">3. I was once concerned for a very elegant and ingenious young lady, who had a reverie on alternate days, which continued nearly the whole day; and as in her days of di&s;ea&s;e &s;he took up the &s;ame kind of ideas, which &s;he had conver&s;ed about on the alternate day before, and could recollect nothing of them on her well-day; &s;he appeared to her friends to po&s;&s;e&s;s two minds. This ca&s;e al&s;o was of epileptic kind, and was cured, with &s;ome relap&s;es, by opium admi|ni&s;tered before the commencement of the paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P N="4">4 Whence it appears, that the methods of relieving inflammatory pains, is by removing all &s;timulus, as by vene&s;ection, cool air, mu|cilaginous diet, aqueous potation, &s;ilence, darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The methods of relieving pains from defect of &s;timulus is by &s;up|plying the peculiar &s;timulus required, as of food, or warmth.</P>
<P>And the general method of relieving pain is by exciting into action &s;ome great part of the &s;y&s;tem for the purpo&s;e of expending a part of the &s;en&s;orial power. This is done either by exertion of the vo|luntary ideas and mu&s;cles, as in in&s;anity and convul&s;ion; or by
<PB N="440" REF="454">
exerting both voluntary and &s;en&s;itive motions, as in reverie; or by exciting the irritative motions by wine or opium internally, and by the warm bath or bli&s;ters externally; or la&s;tly, by exciting the &s;en&s;itive ideas by good news, affecting &s;tories, or agreeable pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">I. 1. MANY &s;ynchronous and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions of our mu&s;cular fibres, and of our organs of &s;en&s;e, or ideas, become a&s;&s;ociated &s;o as to form indi&s;&s;oluble tribes or trains of action, as &s;hewn in Section X. on A&s;&s;ociate Motions. Some con&s;titutions more ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e a&s;|&s;ociations, whether by voluntary, &s;en&s;itive, or irritative repetitions, and &s;ome more ea&s;ily lo&s;e them again, as &s;hewn in Section XXXI. on Temperaments.</P>
<P>When the beginning of &s;uch a train of actions becomes by any means di&s;ordered, the &s;ucceeding part is liable to become di&s;turbed
<PB N="442" REF="456">
in con&s;equence, and this is commonly termed &s;ympathy or con&s;ent of parts by the writers of medicine. For the more clear under&s;tanding of the&s;e &s;ympathies we mu&s;t con&s;ider a tribe or train of actions as di|vided into two parts, and call one of them the primary or original motions, and the other the &s;econdary or &s;ympathetic ones.</P>
<P>The primary and &s;econdary parts of a train of irritative actions may reciprocally affect each other in four different manners. 1. They may both be exerted with greater energy than natural. 2. The former may act with greater, and the latter with le&s;s energy. 3. The former may act with le&s;s, and the latter with greater energy. 4. They may both act with le&s;s energy than natural. I &s;hall now give an example of each kind of the&s;e modes of action, and endeavour to &s;hew, that though the primary and &s;econdary parts of the&s;e trains or tribes of motion are connected by irritative a&s;&s;ociation, or their previous habits of acting together, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XX. on Ver|tigo. Yet that their acting with &s;imilar or di&s;&s;imilar degrees of ener|gy, depends on the greater or le&s;s quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, which the primary part of the train expends in its exertions.</P>
<P>The actions of the &s;tomach con&s;titute &s;o important a part of the a&s;&s;ociations of both irritative and &s;en&s;itive motions, that it is &s;aid to &s;ympathize with almo&s;t every part of the body; the fir&s;t example, which I &s;hall adduce to &s;hew that both the primary and &s;econdary parts of a train of irritative a&s;&s;ociations of motion act with increa&s;ed energy, is taken from the con&s;ent of the &s;kin with this organ. When the action of the fibres of the &s;tomach is increa&s;ed, as by the &s;timulus of a full meal, the exertions of the cutaneous arteries of the face be|come increa&s;ed by their irritative a&s;&s;ociations with tho&s;e of the &s;to|mach, and a glow or flu&s;hing of the face &s;ucceeds. For the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin of the face having been more accu&s;tomed to the va|rieties of action, from their frequent expo&s;ure to various degrees of cold and heat become more ea&s;ily excited into increa&s;ed action, than tho&s;e of the covered parts of our bodies, and thus act with more
<PB N="443" REF="457">
energy from their irritative or &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations with the &s;tomach. On this account in &s;mall-pox the eruption in con&s;equence of the pre|vious affection of the &s;tomach breaks out a day &s;ooner on the face than on the hands, and two days &s;ooner than on the trunk, and recedes in &s;imilar times after maturation.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, in weaker con&s;titutions, that is, in tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power, &s;o much of it is expended in the increa&s;ed actions of the fibres of the &s;tomach excited by the &s;timulus of a meal, that a &s;en&s;e of chilne&s;s &s;ucceeds in&s;tead of the univer&s;al glow above mentioned; and thus the &s;econdary part of the a&s;&s;ociated train of mo|tions is dimini&s;hed in energy, in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed activity of the primary part of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another in&s;tance of a &s;imilar kind, where the &s;econdary part of the train acts with le&s;s energy in con&s;equence of the greater exertions of the primary part, is the vertigo attending intoxication; in this circum&s;tance &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power is expended on the &s;tomach, and on its neare&s;t or more &s;trongly a&s;&s;ociated motions, as tho&s;e of the &s;ubcutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and probably of the membranes of &s;ome inter|nal vi&s;cera, that the irritative motions of the retina become imper|fectly exerted from deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, as explained in Sect. XX. and XXI. on Vertigo and on Drunkenne&s;s, and hence the &s;taggering inebriate cannot completely balance him&s;elf by &s;uch in|di&s;tinct vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. An in&s;tance of the third circum&s;tance, where the primary part of a train of irritative motions acts with le&s;s, and the &s;econdary part with greater energy, may be ob&s;erved by making the following ex|periment. If a per&s;on lies with his arms and &s;houlders out of bed, till they become cold, a temporary coryza or catarrh is produced; &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age of the no&s;trils becomes totally ob&s;tructed; at lea&s;t this happens to many people; and then on covering the arms and &s;houlders, till they become warm, the pa&s;&s;age of the no&s;trils cea&s;es
<PB N="444" REF="458">
again to be ob&s;tructed, and a quantity of mucus is di&s;charged from them. In this ca&s;e the quie&s;cence of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin of the arms and &s;houlders, occa&s;ioned by expo&s;ure to cold air, produces by irritative a&s;&s;ociation an increa&s;ed action of the ve&s;&s;els of the membrane of the no&s;trils; and the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the torpor of the arms and &s;houlders is thus expended in producing a temporary coryza or catarrh.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance may be adduced from the &s;ympathy or con&s;ent of the motions of the &s;tomach with other more di&s;tant links of the very exten&s;ive tribes or trains of irritative motions a&s;&s;ociated with them, de&s;cribed in Sect. XX. on Vertigo. When the actions of the fibres of the &s;tomach are dimini&s;hed or inverted, the actions of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which take up the mucus from the lungs, pericardium, and other cells of the body, become increa&s;ed, and ab&s;orb the fluids accu|mulated in them with greater avidity, as appears from the exhibition of foxglove, antimony, or other emetics in ca&s;es of ana&s;arca, attend|ed with unequal pul&s;e and difficult re&s;piration.</P>
<P>That the act of nau&s;ea and vomiting is a decrea&s;ed exertion of the fibres of the &s;tomach may be thus deduced; when an emetic medi|cine is admini&s;tered, it produces the pain of &s;ickne&s;s, as a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in the mouth produces the pain of nau&s;ea; the&s;e pains, like that of hunger, or of cold, or like tho&s;e, which are u&s;ually termed ner|vous, as the head-ach or hemicrania, do not excite the organ into greater action; but in this ca&s;e I imagine the pains of &s;ickne&s;s or of nau&s;ea counteract or de&s;troy the plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to dige&s;tion, as &s;hewn in Sect. XXXIII. 1. 1. The peri|&s;taltic motions of the fibres of the &s;tomach become enfeebled by the want of this &s;timulus of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, and in con&s;equence &s;top for a time, and then become inverted; for they cannot become inverted without being previou&s;ly &s;topped. Now that this inver&s;ion of the trains of motion of the fibres of the &s;tomach is owing to the de|ficiency
<PB N="445" REF="459">
of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is evinced from this circum&s;tance, that a nau&s;eous idea excited by words will produce vomiting as effec|tually as a nau&s;eous drug.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that the act of nau&s;ea or vomiting expends le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power than the u&s;ual peri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach in the dige&s;tion of our aliment; and that hence there is a greater quan|tity of &s;en&s;orial power becomes accumulated in the fibres of the &s;to|mach, and more of it in con&s;equence to &s;pare for the action of tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which are thus a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;tomach, as of the whole ab&s;orbent &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els, and which are at the &s;ame time excited by their u&s;ual &s;timuli.</P>
<P>From this we can under&s;tand, how after the operation of an emetic the &s;tomach becomes more irritable and &s;en&s;ible to the &s;timulus, and the plea&s;ure of food; &s;ince as the &s;en&s;orial power becomes accumu|lated during the nau&s;ea and vomiting, the dige&s;tive power is after|wards exerted more forceably for a time. It &s;hould, however, be here remarked, that though vomiting is in general produced by the defect of this &s;timulus of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, as when a nau&s;eous drug is admini&s;tered; yet in long continued vomiting, as in &s;ea-&s;ick|ne&s;s, or from habitual dram-drinking, it ari&s;es from deficiency of &s;en|&s;orial power, which in the former ca&s;e is exhau&s;ted by the increa&s;ed exertion of the irritative ideas of vi&s;ion, and in the latter by the fre|quent application of an unnatural &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="4">4. An example of the fourth circum&s;tance above mentioned, where both the primary and &s;econdary parts of a train of motions proceed with energy le&s;s than natural, may be ob&s;erved in the dy&s;pnoea, which occurs in going into a very cold bath, and which has been de|&s;cribed and explained in Sect. XXXII. 3. 2.</P>
<P>And by the increa&s;ed debility of the pul&s;ations of the heart and ar|teries during the operation of an emetic. Secondly, from the &s;low|ne&s;s and intermi&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;ations of the heart from the ince&s;&s;ant efforts to vomit occa&s;ioned by an overdo&s;e of digitalis. And thirdly,
<PB N="446" REF="460">
from the total &s;toppage of the motions of the heart, or death, in con|&s;equence of the torpor of the &s;tomach, when affected with the com|mencement or cold paroxy&s;m of the gout. See Sect. XXV. 17.</P>

In both the&s;e ca&s;es the part, which is affected &s;econdarily, is believed to be much more &s;en&s;ible than the part primarily affected, as de&s;cribed in the catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es, Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 10. and IV. 2. 1. 1. and IV. 2. 1. 2.</P>
<P>The hemicrania, or nervous headach, as it is called, when it ori|ginates from a decaying tooth, is another di&s;ea&s;e of this kind; as the pain of the carious tooth always cea&s;es, when the pain over one eye and temple commences. And it is probable, that the violent pains, which induce convul&s;ions in painful epilep&s;ies, are produced in the &s;ame manner, from a more &s;en&s;ible part &s;ympathizing with a di&s;ea&s;ed one of le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility.

of that &s;ide. The la&s;t tooth of the under-jaw is al&s;o liable to produce a &s;imilar hemicrania, when it begins to decay.

<P>Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, about 30 years of age, was &s;eized with great pain about the middle of the right parietal bone, which had continued a whole day before I &s;aw her, and was &s;o violent as to threaten to oc|ca&s;ion convul&s;ions. Not being able to detect a decaying tooth, or a tender one, by examination with my eye, or by &s;triking them with a tea-&s;poon, and fearing bad con&s;equences from her tendency to con|vul&s;ion, I advi&s;ed her to extract the la&s;t tooth of the under-jaw on the affected &s;ide; which was done without any good effect. She was then directed to lo&s;e blood, and to take a bri&s;k cathartic; and after that had operated, about 60 drops of laudanum were given her, with large do&s;es of bark; by which the pain was removed. In about a fortnight &s;he took a cathartic medicine by ill advice, and the pain re|turned with greater violence in the &s;ame place; and, before I could arrive, as &s;he lived 30 miles from me, &s;he &s;uffered a paralytic &s;troke; which affected her limbs and her face on one &s;ide, and relieved the pain of her head.</P>
<P>About a year afterwards I was again called to her on account of a pain as violent as before exactly on the &s;ame part of the other parietal bone. On examining her mouth I found the &s;econd molaris of the under-jaw on the &s;ide before affected was now decayed, and con|cluded, that this tooth had occa&s;ioned the &s;troke of the pal&s;y by the pain and con&s;equent exertion it had cau&s;ed. On this account I ear|ne&s;tly
<PB N="448" REF="462">
entreated her to allow the &s;ound molaris of the &s;ame jaw op|po&s;ite to the decayed one to be extracted; which was forthwith done, and the pain of her head immediately cea&s;ed, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of her attendants.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;es above related of the pain exi&s;ting in a part di&s;tant from the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pain is owing to defect of the u&s;ual mo|tions of the painful part. This appears from the coldne&s;s, palene&s;s, and emptine&s;s of the affected ve&s;&s;els, or of the extremities of the body in general, and from there being no tendency to inflammation. The increa&s;ed action of the primary part of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociated motions, as of the hepatic termination of the bile-duct from the &s;timulus of a gall|&s;tone, or of the interior termination of the urethra from the &s;timulus of a &s;tone in the bladder, or la&s;tly, of a decaying tooth in hemicrania, deprives the &s;econdary part of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociated motions, namely, the exterior terminations of the bile-duct or urethra, or the pained mem|branes of the head in hemicrania, of their natural &s;hare of &s;en&s;orial power: and hence the &s;econdary parts of the&s;e &s;en&s;itive trains of a&s;&s;o|ciation become pained from the deficiency of their u&s;ual motions, which is accompanied with deficiency of &s;ecretions and of heat. See Sect. IV. 5. XII. 5. 3. XXXIV. 1.</P>
<P>Why does the pain of the primary part of the a&s;&s;ociation cea&s;e, when that of the &s;econdary part commences? This is a que&s;tion of intricacy, but perhaps not inexplicable. The pain of the primary part of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociated trains of motion was owing to too great &s;timu|lus, as of the &s;tone at the neck of the bladder, and was con&s;equently cau&s;ed by too great action of the pained part. This greater action than natural of the primary part of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociated motions, by em|ploying or expending the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation belonging to the whole a&s;&s;ociated train of motions, occa&s;ioned torpor, and con&s;equent pain, in the &s;econdary part of the a&s;&s;ociated train; which was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater &s;en&s;ibility than the primary part of it. Now the great pain of the &s;econdary part of the train, as &s;oon as it commences,
<PB N="449" REF="463">
employs or expends the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation belonging to the whole a&s;&s;ociated train of motions; and in con&s;equence the motions of the primary part, though increa&s;ed by the &s;timulus of an extrane|ous body, cea&s;e to be accompanied with pain or &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>If this mode of rea&s;oning be ju&s;t it explains a curious fact, why when two parts of the body are &s;trongly &s;timulated, the pain is felt only in one of them, though it is po&s;&s;ible by voluntary attention it may be alternately perceived in them both. In the &s;ame manner, when two new ideas are pre&s;ented to us from the &s;timulus of external bodies, we attend to but one of them at a time. In other words, when one &s;et of fibres, whether of the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e, contract &s;o &s;trongly as to excite much &s;en&s;ation; another &s;et of fibres contracting more weakly do not excite &s;en&s;ation at all, becau&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is pre-occupied by the fir&s;t &s;et of fibres. So we cannot will more then one effect at once, though by a&s;&s;ocia|tions previou&s;ly formed we can move many fibres in combination.</P>
<P>Thus in the in&s;tances above related, the termination of the bile duct in the duodenum, and the exterior extremity of the urethra, are more &s;en&s;ible than their other terminations. When the&s;e parts are deprived of their u&s;ual motions by deficiency of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, they become painful according to law the fifth in Section IV. and the le&s;s pain originally excited by the &s;timulus of concreted bile, or of a &s;tone at their other extremities cea&s;es to be perceived. Afterwards, however, when the concretions of bile, or the &s;tone on the urinary bladder, become more numerous or larger, the pain from their increa&s;ed &s;timulus becomes greater than the a&s;&s;ociated pain; and is then felt at the neck of the gall bladder or urinary bladder; and the pain of the glans penis, or at the pit of the &s;tomach, cea&s;es to be perceived.</P>
<P N="2">2. Examples of the &s;econd mode, where the increa&s;ed action of the primary part of a train of &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation cea&s;es, when that of the &s;econdary part commences, are al&s;o not unfrequent; as this is
<PB N="450" REF="464">
the u&s;ual manner of the tran&s;lation of inflammations from internal to external parts of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;uch as when an inflammation of the liver or &s;tomach is tran&s;lated to the membranes of the foot, and forms the gout; or to the &s;kin of the face, and forms the ro&s;y drop, or when an inflammation of the membranes of the kidneys is tran&s;|lated to the &s;kin of the loins, and forms one kind of herpes, called &s;hingles; in the&s;e ca&s;es by whatever cau&s;e the original inflammation may have been produced, as the &s;econdary part of the train of &s;en&s;i|tive a&s;&s;ociation is more &s;en&s;ible, it becomes exerted with greater vio|lence than the fir&s;t part of it; and by both its increa&s;ed pain, and the increa&s;ed motion of its fibres, &s;o far dimini&s;hes or exhau&s;ts the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation; that the primary part of the train being le&s;s &s;en&s;ible cea&s;es both to feel pain, and to act with unnatural energy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Examples of the third mode, where the primary part of a train of &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation of motions may experience increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation, and the &s;econdary part increa&s;ed action, are likewi&s;e not unfrequent; as it is in this manner that mo&s;t inflammations commence. Thus, after &s;tanding &s;ome time in &s;now, the feet become affected with the pain of cold, and a common coryza, or inflammation of the mem|brane of the no&s;trils, &s;ucceeds. It is probable that the internal in|flammations, as pleuri&s;ies, or hepatitis, which are produced after the cold paroxy&s;m of fever, originate in the &s;ame manner from the &s;ym|pathy of tho&s;e parts with &s;ome others, which were previou&s;ly pained from quie&s;cence; as happens to various parts of the &s;y&s;tem during the cold fits of fevers. In the&s;e ca&s;es it would &s;eem, that the &s;en|&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation becomes accumulated during the pain of cold, as the torpor of the ve&s;&s;els occa&s;ioned by the defect of heat con|tributes to the increa&s;e or accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, and that both the&s;e become exerted on &s;ome internal part, which was not rendered torpid by the cold which affected the external
<PB N="451" REF="465">
parts, nor by its a&s;&s;ociation with them; or which &s;ooner recovered its &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P N="4">4. An example of the fourth mode, or where the primary part of a &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation of motions may have increa&s;ed action, and the &s;econdary part increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation, may be taken from the pain of the &s;houlder, which attends inflammation of the membranes of the liver, &s;ee Hepatitis, Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 6. in this circum&s;tance &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power &s;eems to be expended in the violent actions and &s;en&s;ations of the inflamed membranes of the liver, that the membranes a&s;&s;ociated with them become quie&s;cent to their u&s;ual &s;timuli, and painful in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>There may be other modes in which the primary and &s;econdary parts of the trains of a&s;&s;ociated &s;en&s;itive motions may reciprocally affect each other, as may be &s;een by looking over Cla&s;s IV. in the catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es; all which may probably be re&s;olved into the plus and minus of &s;en&s;orial power, but we have not yet had &s;ufficient ob&s;ervations made upon them with a view to this doctrine.</P>

Mu&s;cles &s;ubjected to le&s;s &s;timulus have their &s;en&s;orial power accumulated. Hence the periods of &s;ome fevers. Want of irritability after intoxication. II. 1.

Lunar periods in the &s;mall pox.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. IF any of our mu&s;cles be made to contract violently by the power of volition, as tho&s;e of the fingers, when any one hangs by his hands on a &s;wing, fatigue &s;oon en&s;ues; and the mu&s;cles cea&s;e to act owing to the temporary exhau&s;tion of the &s;pirit of animation; as &s;oon as this is again accumulated in the mu&s;cles, they are ready to contract again by the efforts of volition.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e violent mu&s;cular actions induced by pain become in the &s;ame manner intermitted and recurrent; as in labour-pains, vomit|ing, tene&s;mus, &s;trangury; owing likewi&s;e to the temporary exhau&s;|tion of the &s;pirit of animation, as above mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="467">
When any &s;timulus continues long to act with unnatural violence, &s;o as to produce too energetic action of any of our moving organs, tho&s;e motions &s;oon cea&s;e, though the &s;timulus continues to act; as in looking long on a bright object, as on an inch-&s;quare of red &s;ilk laid on white paper in the &s;un&s;hine. See Plate I. in Sect. III. 1.</P>
<P>On the contrary, where le&s;s of the &s;timulus of volition, &s;en&s;ation, or irritation, have been applied to a mu&s;cle than u&s;ual; there ap|pears to be an accumulation of the &s;pirit of animation in the moving organ; by which it is liable to act with greater energy from le&s;s quantity of &s;timulus, than was previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to excite it into &s;o great action; as after having been immer&s;ed in &s;now the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els of our hands are excited into &s;tronger action by the &s;timulus of a le&s;s degree of heat, than would previou&s;ly have produced that effect.</P>
<P>From hence the periods of &s;ome fever-fits may take their origin, either &s;imply, or by their accidental coincidence with lunar and &s;olar periods, or with the diurnal periods of heat and cold, to be treated of below; for during the cold fit at the commencement of a fever, from whatever cau&s;e that cold fit may have been induced, it follows, 1. That the &s;pirit of animation mu&s;t become accumulated in the parts, which exert during this cold fit le&s;s than their natural quan|tity of action. 2. If the cau&s;e producing the cold fit does not in|crea&s;e, or becomes dimini&s;hed; the parts before benumbed or in|active become now excitable by &s;maller &s;timulus, and are thence thrown into more violent action than is natural; that is a hot fit &s;uc|ceeds the cold one. 3. By the energetic action of the &s;y&s;tem during the hot fit, if it continues long, an exhau&s;tion of the &s;pirit of ani|mation takes place; and another cold fit is liable to &s;ucceed, from the moving &s;y&s;tem not being excitable into action from its u&s;ual &s;timulus. This inirritability of the &s;y&s;tem from a too great previous &s;timulus, and con&s;equent exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, is the cau&s;e of the general debility, and &s;ickne&s;s, and head-ach, &s;ome hours after in|toxication.
<PB N="454" REF="468">
And hence we &s;ee one of the cau&s;es of the periods of fever-fits; which however are frequently combined with the periods of our diurnal habits, or of heat and cold, or of &s;olar or lunar periods.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">II. 1. The following are natural animal actions, which are fre|quently catenated with our daily habits of life, as well as excited by their natural irritations. The periods of hunger and thir&s;t become catenated with certain portions of time, or degrees of exhau&s;tion, or other diurnal habits of life. And if the pain of hunger be not re|lieved by taking food at the u&s;ual time, it is liable to cea&s;e till the next period of time or other habits recur; this is not only true in re&s;pect to our general de&s;ire of food, but the kinds of it al&s;o are governed by this periodical habit; in&s;omuch that beer taken to break|fa&s;t will di&s;turb the dige&s;tion of tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to tea; and tea taken at dinner will di&s;agree with tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to beer. Whence it happens, that tho&s;e, who have weak &s;tomachs, will be able to dige&s;t more food, if they take their meals at regular hours; becau&s;e they have both the &s;timulus of the aliment they take, and the periodical habit, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their dige&s;|tion.</P>
<P>The periods of emptying the bladder are not only dependent on the acrimony or di&s;tention of the water in it, but are frequently
<PB N="455" REF="469">
catenated with external cold applied to the &s;kin, as in cold bathing, or wa&s;hing the hands; or with other habits of life, as many are ac|cu&s;tomed to empty the bladder before going to bed, or into the hou&s;e after a journey, and this whether it be full or not.</P>
<P>Our times of re&s;piration are not only governed by the &s;timulus of the blood in the lungs, or our de&s;ire of fre&s;h air, but al&s;o by our attention to the hourly objects before us. Hence when a per&s;on is earne&s;tly contemplating an idea of grief, he forgets to breathe, till the &s;en&s;ation in his lungs becomes very urgent; and then a &s;igh &s;uc|ceeds for the purpo&s;e of more forceably pu&s;hing forwards the blood, which is accumulated in the lungs.</P>
<P>Our times of re&s;piration are al&s;o frequently governed in part by our want of a &s;teady &s;upport for the actions of our arms, and hands, as in threading a needle, or hewing wood, or in &s;wimming; when we are intent upon the&s;e objects, we breathe at the intervals of the exertion of the pectoral mu&s;cles.</P>
<P N="2">2. The following natural animal actions are influenced by &s;olar periods. The periods of &s;leep and of waking depends much on the &s;olar period, for we are inclined to &s;leep at a certain hour, and to awake at a certain hour, whether we have had more or le&s;s fatigue during the day, if within certain limits; and are liable to wake at a certain hour, whether we went to bed earlier or later within certain limits. Hence it appears, that tho&s;e who complain of want of &s;leep, will be liable to &s;leep better or longer, if they accu&s;tom them&s;elves to go to re&s;t, and to ri&s;e, at certain hours.</P>
<P>The periods of evacuating the bowels are generally connected with &s;ome part of the &s;olar day, as well as with the acrimony or di&s;ten|tion occa&s;ioned by the feces. Hence one method of correcting co&s;|tivene&s;s is by endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h a habit of evacuation at a cer|tain hour of the day, as recommended by Mr. Locke, which may be accompli&s;hed by u&s;ing daily voluntary efforts at tho&s;e times, joined with the u&s;ual &s;timulus of the material to be evacuated.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="456" REF="470">
3. The following natural animal actions are connected with lunar periods. 1. The periods of female men&s;truation are connected with lunar periods to great exactne&s;s, in &s;ome in&s;tances even to a few hours. The&s;e do not commence or terminate at the full or change, or at any other particular part of the lunation, but after they have commenced at any part of it, they continue to recur at that part with great regularity, unle&s;s di&s;turbed by &s;ome violent circum&s;tance, as explained in Sect. XXXII. No. 6. their return is immediately cau&s;ed by deficient venous ab&s;orption, which is owing to the want of the &s;timulus, de&s;igned by nature, of amatorial copulation, or of the growing fetus. When the catamenia returns &s;ooner than the period of lunation, it &s;hews a tendency of the con&s;titution to inirritabi|lity; that is to debility, or deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, and is to be relieved by &s;mall do&s;es of &s;teel and opium.</P>
<P>The venereal orga&s;m of birds and quadrupeds &s;eems to commence, or return about the mo&s;t powerful lunations at the vernal or autumnal equinoxes; but if it be di&s;appointed of its object, it is &s;aid to recur at monthly periods; in this re&s;pect re&s;embling the female catamenia. Whence it is believed, that women are more liable to become preg|nant at or about the time of their catamenia, than at the intermediate times; and on this account they are &s;eldom much mi&s;taken in their reckoning of nine lunar periods from the la&s;t men&s;truation; the in|attention to this may &s;ometimes have been the cau&s;e of &s;uppo&s;ed bar|renne&s;s, and is therefore worth the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to have children.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P>III. We now come to the periods of di&s;ea&s;ed animal actions. The periods of fever-fits, which depend on the &s;tated returns of noc|turnal cold, are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in Sect. XXXII. 3. Tho&s;e, which origi|nate or recur at &s;olar or lunar periods, are al&s;o explained in Section XXXII. 6. The&s;e we &s;hall here enumerate; ob&s;erving, however, that it is not more &s;urpri&s;ing, that the influence of the varying attractions of the &s;un and moon, &s;hould rai&s;e the ocean into mountains, than
<PB N="457" REF="471">
that it &s;hould affect the nice &s;en&s;ibilities of animal bodies; though the manner of its operation on them is difficult to be under&s;tood. It is probable however, that as this influence gradually le&s;&s;ens during the cour&s;e of the day, or of the lunation, or of the year, &s;ome actions of our &s;y&s;tem become le&s;s and le&s;s; till at length a total quie&s;cence of &s;ome part is induced; which is the commencement of the pa|roxy&s;ms of fever, of men&s;truation, of pain with decrea&s;ed action of the affected organ, and of con&s;equent convul&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. A diurnal fever in &s;ome weak people is di&s;tinctly ob&s;erved to come on towards evening, and to cea&s;e with a moi&s;t &s;kin early in the morning, obeying the &s;olar periods. Per&s;ons of weak con&s;titutions are liable to get into better &s;pirits at the acce&s;s of the hot fit of this evening fever; and are thence inclined to fit up late; which by fur|ther enfeebling them increa&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e; whence they lo&s;e their &s;trength and their colour.</P>
<P N="2">2. The periods of hectic fever, &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from ab&s;orption of matter, obeys the diurnal periods like the above, having the exacer|be&s;cence towards evening, and its remi&s;&s;ion early in the morning, with &s;weats, or diarrhoea, or urine with white &s;ediment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The periods of quotidian fever are either catenated with &s;olar time, and return at the intervals of twenty-four hours; or with lunar time, recurring at the intervals of about twenty-five hours. There is great u&s;e in knowing with what circum&s;tances the periodical return of new morbid motions are conjoined, as the mo&s;t effectual times of exhibiting the proper medicines are thus determined. So if the tor|por, which u&s;hers in an ague fit, is catenated with the lunar day: it is know, when the bark or opium mu&s;t be given, &s;o as to exert its principal effect about the time of the expected return. Solid opium &s;hould be given about an hour before the expected cold fit; liquid opium and wine about half an hour; the bark repeatedly for &s;ix or eight hours previous to the expected return.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="458" REF="472">
4. The periods of tertian fevers, reckoned from the commence|ment of one cold fit to the commencement of the next cold fit, recur with &s;olar intervals of forty-eight hours, or with lunar ones of about fifty hours. When the&s;e times of recurrence begin one or two hours earlier than the &s;olar period, it &s;hews, that the torpor or cold fit is produced by le&s;s external influence; and therefore that it is more li|able to degenerate into a fever with only remi&s;&s;ions; &s;o when men|&s;truation recurs &s;ooner than the period of lunation, it &s;hews a ten|dency of the habit to torpor or inirritability.</P>
<P N="5">5. The periods of quartan fevers return at &s;olar intervals of &s;eventy|two hours, or at lunar ones of about &s;eventy-four hours and an half. This kind of ague appears mo&s;t in moi&s;t cold autumns, and in cold countries replete with mar&s;hes. It is attended with greater debility, and its cold acce&s;s more difficult to prevent. For where there is pre|viou&s;ly a deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, the con&s;titution is liable to run into greater torpor from any further diminution of it; two ounces of bark and &s;ome &s;teel &s;hould be given on the day before the return of the cold paroxy&s;m, and a pint of wine by degrees a few hours before its return, and thirty drops of laudanum one hour before the expected cold fit.</P>
<P N="6">6. The periods of the gout generally commence about an hour be|fore &s;un-ri&s;e, which is u&s;ually the colde&s;t part of the twenty-four hours. The greater periods of the gout &s;eem al&s;o to ob&s;erve the &s;olar influence, returning about the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P N="7">7. The periods of the pleuri&s;y recur with exacerbation of the pain and fever about &s;un-&s;et, at which time vene&s;ection is of mo&s;t &s;ervice.

<P>IV. The critical days, in which fevers are &s;uppo&s;ed to terminate, have employed the attention of medical philo&s;ophers from the days of Hippocrates to the pre&s;ent time. In whatever part of a lunation a fever commences, which owes either its whole cau&s;e to &s;olar and lu|nar influence, or to this in conjunction with other cau&s;es; it would &s;eem, that the effect would be the greate&s;t at the full and new moon, as the tides ri&s;e highe&s;t at tho&s;e times, and would be the lea&s;t at the quadratures; thus if a fever-fit &s;hould commence at the new or full moon, occa&s;ioned by the &s;olar and lunar attraction dimini&s;hing &s;ome chemical affinity of the particles of blood, and thence decrea&s;ing their &s;timulus on our &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, as mentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. this effect will daily decrea&s;e for the fir&s;t &s;even days, and will then increa&s;e till about the fourteenth day, and will again decrea&s;e till about the twenty-fir&s;t day, and increa&s;e again till the end of the lunation. If a fever-fit from the above cau&s;e &s;hould commence on the &s;eventh day after either lunation, the rever&s;e of the above circum&s;tances would happen. Now it is probable, that tho&s;e fevers, who&s;e cri&s;is or ter|minations are influenced by lunations, may begin at one or other of the above times, namely at the changes or quadratures; though &s;uf|ficient ob&s;ervations have not been made to a&s;certain this circum&s;tance. Hence I conclude, that the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les have their critical days, not governed by the times required for certain chemical changes in the blood, which affect or alter the &s;timulus of the contagious matter, but from the daily increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing effect of this lunar
<PB N="461" REF="475">
link of catenation, as explained in Section XVII. 3. 3. And as other fevers terminate mo&s;t frequently about the &s;eventh, fourteenth, twenty-fir&s;t, or about the end of four weeks, when no medical a&s;|&s;i&s;tance has di&s;turbed their periods, I conclude, that the&s;e cri&s;es, or terminations, are governed by periods of the lunations, though we are &s;till ignorant of their manner of operation.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox the ve&s;tiges of lunation are very apparent, after inoculation a quarter of a lunation precedes the commencement of the fever, another quarter terminates with the complete eruption, another quarter with the complete maturation, and another quarter terminates the complete ab&s;orption of a material now rendered inoffen|&s;ive to the con&s;titution.</P>

<P>I. THE larger cry&s;tals of &s;aline bodies may be conceived to ari&s;e from the combination of &s;maller cry&s;tals of the &s;ame form, owing to the greater attractions of their &s;ides than of their angles. Thus if four cubes were floating in a fluid, who&s;e friction or re&s;i&s;tance is no|thing, it is certain the &s;ides of the&s;e cubes would attract each other &s;tronger than their angles; and hence that the&s;e four &s;maller cubes would &s;o arrange them&s;elves as to produce one larger one.</P>

and la&s;tly, by the agglutination of a third &s;ub&s;tance penetrating the pores of the other two, as in the agglutination of wood by means of animal gluten.

<P>II. When the pain of hunger requires relief, certain parts of the material world, which &s;urround us, when applied to our palates, ex|cite into action the mu&s;cles of deglutition; and the material is &s;wal|lowed into the &s;tomach. Here the new aliment becomes mixed with certain animal fluids, and undergoes a chemical proce&s;s, termed di|ge&s;tion; which however chemi&s;try has not yet learnt to imitate out of the bodies of living animals or vegetables. This proce&s;s &s;eems very &s;imilar to the &s;accharine proce&s;s in the lobes of farinaceous &s;eeds, as of barley, when it begins to germinate; except that, along with the &s;ugar, oil and mucilage are al&s;o produced; which form the chyle of animals, which is very &s;imilar to their milk.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on, I imagine, why this chyle-making, or &s;accharine pro|ce&s;s, has not yet been imitated by chemical operations, is owing to the materials being in &s;uch a &s;ituation in re&s;pect to warmth, moi&s;ture, and motion; that they will immediately change into the vinous or acetous fermentation; except the new &s;ugar be ab&s;orbed by the nu|merous lacteal or lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, as &s;oon as it is produced; which is not ea&s;y to imitate in the laboratory.</P>
<P>The&s;e lacteal ve&s;&s;els have mouths, which are irritated into action by the &s;timulus of the fluid, which &s;urrounds them; and by animal &s;election, or appetency, they ab&s;orb &s;uch part of the fluid as is agree|able to their palate; tho&s;e parts, for in&s;tance, which are already con|verted into chyle, before they have time to undergo another change by a vinous or acetous fermentation.

<P>III. The arteries con&s;titute another re&s;ervoir of a changeful fluid; from which, after its recent oxygenation in the lungs, a further ani|mal &s;election of various fluids is ab&s;orbed by the numerous glands; the&s;e &s;elect their re&s;pective fluids from the blood, which is perpetu|ally undergoing a chemical change; but the &s;election by the&s;e glands, like that of the lacteals, which open their mouths into the dige&s;ting aliment in the &s;tomach, is from animal appetency, not from chemical affinity; &s;ecretion cannot therefore be imitated in the laboratory, as it con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;election of part of a fluid during the chemical change of that fluid.</P>
<P>The mouths of the lacteals, and lymphatics, and the ultimate ter|minations of the glands, are finer than can ea&s;ily be conceived; yet it is probable, that the pores, or inter&s;tices of the parts, or coats, which con&s;titute the&s;e ultimate ve&s;&s;els, may &s;till have greater tenuity; and that the&s;e pores from the above analogy mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;imilar power of irritability, and ab&s;orb by their living energy the particles of fluid adapted to their purpo&s;es, whether to replace the parts abraded or di&s;&s;olved, or to elongate and enlarge them&s;elves. Not only every kind of gland is thus endued with its peculiar appetency, and &s;elects the material agreeable to its ta&s;te from the blood, but every individual pore acquires by animal &s;election the material, which it wants; and thus nutrition &s;eems to be performed in a manner &s;o &s;imilar to &s;ecre|tion; that they only differ in the one retaining, and the other parting again with the particles, which they have &s;elected from the blood.</P>
<P>This way of accounting for nutrition from &s;timulus, and the con|&s;equent animal &s;election of particles, is much more analogous to other phenomena of the animal microco&s;m, than by having recour&s;e to the micro&s;copic animalcula, or organic particles of Buffon and Needham;
<PB N="465" REF="479">
which being already compounded mu&s;t them&s;elves require nutritive particles to continue their own exi&s;tence.

<P>The whole animal &s;y&s;tem may be con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;ting of the extremities of the nerves, or of having been produced from them; if we except perhaps the medullary part of the brain re&s;iding in the head and &s;pine, and in the trunks of the nerves. The&s;e extremities of the nerves are either of tho&s;e of locomotion, which are termed mu&s;cular fibres; or of tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ation, which con&s;titute the im|mediate organs of &s;en&s;e, and which have al&s;o their peculiar motions. Now as the fibres, which con&s;titute the bones and membranes, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed originally &s;en&s;ation and motion; and are liable again to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, when they become inflamed; it follows, that tho&s;e were, when fir&s;t formed, appendages to the nerves of &s;en&s;ation or locomo|tion, or were formed from them. And that hence all the&s;e &s;olid parts of the body, as they have originally con&s;i&s;ted of extremities of nerves, require an appo&s;ition of nutritive particles of a &s;imilar kind, contrary to the opinion of Buffon and Needham above recited.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as all the&s;e filaments have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or do po&s;&s;e&s;s, the power of contraction, and of con&s;equent inertion or elongation; it &s;eems probable, that the nutritive particles are applied during their times of elongation; when their original con&s;tituent particles are re|moved to a greater di&s;tance from each other. For each mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual fibre may be con&s;idered as a row or &s;tring of beads; which approach, when in contraction, and recede during its re&s;t or elonga|tion; and our daily experience &s;hews us, that great action emaciates the &s;y&s;tem, and that it is repaired during re&s;t.</P>

Something like this is &s;een out of the body; for if a hair, or a &s;ingle untwi&s;ted fibre of flax or &s;ilk, be &s;oaked in water; it becomes longer and thicker by the water, which is ab&s;orbed into its pores. Now if a hair could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be thus immer&s;ed in a &s;olution of particles &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which compo&s;e it; one may imagine, that it might be thus increa&s;ed in weight and magnitude; as the particles of oak-bark increa&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance of the hides of bea&s;ts in the proce&s;s of making leather. I mention the&s;e not as philo&s;ophic analogies, but as &s;imiles to facilitate our ideas, how an accretion of parts may be ef|fected by animal appetences, or &s;elections, in a manner &s;omewhat &s;imilar to mechanical or chemical attractions.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e new particles of matter, previou&s;ly prepared by dige&s;tion and &s;anguification, only &s;upply the places of tho&s;e, which have been abraded by the actions of the &s;y&s;tem, it is properly termed nutrition. If they are applied to the extremities of the nervous fibrils, or in &s;uch quantity as to increa&s;e the length or cra&s;&s;itude of them, the body be|comes at the &s;ame time enlarged, and its growth is increa&s;ed, as well as its deficiences repaired.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t ca&s;e &s;omething more than a &s;imple appo&s;ition or &s;elec|tion of particles &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary; as many parts of the &s;y&s;tem during its growth are cau&s;ed to recede from tho&s;e, with which they were before in contact; as the ends of the bones, or cartilages, recede from each other, as their growth advances: this proce&s;s re&s;embles inflammation, as appears in ophthalmy, or in the production of new fle&s;h in ulcers, where old ve&s;&s;els are enlarged, and new ones pro|duced; and like that is attended with &s;en&s;ation. In this &s;ituation the ve&s;&s;els become di&s;tended with blood, and acquire greater &s;en&s;ibility, and may thus be compared to the erection of the penis, or of the nipples of the brea&s;ts of women; while new particles become added at the &s;ame time; as in the proce&s;s of nurition above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>When only the natural growth of the various parts of the body are produced, a plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation attends it, as in youth, and

<P>On con&s;idering this &s;ubject one &s;hould have imagined at fir&s;t view, that it might have been ea&s;ier for nature to have &s;upported her pro|geny for ever in health and life, than to have perpetually reproduced them by the wonderful and my&s;terious proce&s;s of generation. But it &s;eems our bodies by long habit cea&s;e to obey the &s;timulus of the aliment, which &s;hould &s;upport us. After we have acquired our height and &s;olidity we make no more new parts, and the &s;y&s;tem obeys the irritations, &s;en&s;ations, volitions, and a&s;&s;ociations, with le&s;s and le&s;s energy, till the whole &s;inks into inaction.</P>
<P>Three cau&s;es may con&s;pire to render our nerves le&s;s excitable, which have been already mentioned. 1. If a &s;timulus be greater than natural, it produces too great an exertion of the &s;timulated organ, and in con&s;equence exhau&s;ts the &s;pirit of animation; and the moving organ cea&s;es to act, even though the &s;timulus be con|tinued. And though re&s;t will recruit this exhau&s;tion, yet &s;ome de|gree of permanent injury remains, as is evident after expo&s;ing the eyes long to too &s;trong a light. 2. If excitations weaker than na|tural be applied, &s;o as not to excite the organ into action, (as when &s;mall do&s;es of aloe or rhubarb are exhibited,) they may be gradually increa&s;ed, without exciting the organ into action; which will thus acquire a habit of di&s;obedience to the &s;timulus; thus by increa&s;ing the
<PB N="468" REF="482">
do&s;e by degrees, great quantities of opium or wine may be taken without intoxication. See Sect. XII. 3. 1.</P>
<P>3. Another mode, by which life is gradually undermined, is when irritative motions continue to be produced in con&s;equence of &s;timulus, but are not &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation; hence the &s;timulus of contagious matter is not capable of producing fever a &s;econd time, becau&s;e it is not &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation. See Sect. XII. 3. 6. And hence, owing to the want of the general plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation, which ought to at|tend dige&s;tion and glandular &s;ecretion, an irk&s;omene&s;s of life en&s;ues&punc; and, where this is in greater exce&s;s, the melancholy of old age oc|curs, with torpor or debility.</P>
<P>From hence I conclude, that it is probable that the fibrillae, or moving filaments at the extremities of the nerves of &s;en&s;e, and the fibres which con&s;titute the mu&s;cles (which are perhaps the only parts of the &s;y&s;tem that are endued with contractile life) are not changed, as we advance in years, like the other parts of the body; but only enlarged or elongated with our growth; and in con&s;equence they be|come le&s;s and le&s;s excitable into action. Whence, in&s;tead of gradu|ally changing the old animal, the generation of a totally new one becomes nece&s;&s;ary with undimini&s;hed excitability; which many years will continue to acquire new parts, or new &s;olidity, and then lo&s;ing its excitability in time, peri&s;h like its parent.</P>

<P>I. FROM the recent di&s;coveries of many ingenious philo&s;ophers it appears, that during re&s;piration the blood imbibes the vital part of the air, called oxygene, through the membranes of the lungs; and that hence re&s;piration may be aptly compared to a &s;low combu&s;tion. As in combu&s;tion the oxygene of the atmo&s;phere unites with &s;ome phlo|gi&s;tic or inflammable body, and forms an acid (as in the production of vitriolic acid from &s;ulphur, or carbonic acid from charcoal,) giving out at the &s;ame time a quantity of the matter of heat; &s;o in re&s;pira|tion the oxygene of the air unites with the phlogi&s;tic part of the blood, and probably produces pho&s;phoric or animal acid, changing the colour
<PB N="471" REF="485">
of the blood from a dark to a bright red; and probably &s;ome of the matter of heat is at the &s;ame time given out according to the theory of Dr. Crawford. But as the evolution of heat attends almo&s;t all che|mical combinations, it is probable, that it al&s;o attends the &s;ecretions of the various fluids from the blood; and that the con&s;tant combina|tions or productions of new fluids by means of the glands con&s;titute the more general &s;ource of animal heat; this &s;eems evinced by the univer&s;al evolution of the matter of heat in the blu&s;h of &s;hame or of anger; in which at the &s;ame time an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of the per|&s;pirable matter occurs; and the partial evolution of it from topical in|flammations, as in gout or rheumati&s;m, in which there is a &s;ecretion of new blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Some medical philo&s;ophers have a&s;cribed the heat of animal bodies to the friction of the particles of the blood again&s;t the &s;ides of the ve&s;|&s;els. But no perceptible heat has ever been produced by the agitation of water, or oil, or quick&s;ilver, or other fluids; except tho&s;e fluids have undergone at the &s;ame time &s;ome chemical change, as in agitat|ing milk or wine, till they become &s;our.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;uppo&s;ed production of pho&s;phoric acid, and change of colour of the blood, and the production of carbonic acid, there would appear to be &s;omething of a more &s;ubtile nature perpetually acquired from the atmo&s;phere; which is too fine to be long contained in ani|mal ve&s;&s;els, and therefore requires perpetual renovation; and without which life cannot continue longer than a minute or two; this ethe|real fluid is probably &s;ecreted from the blood by the brain, and perpetually di&s;&s;ipated in the actions of the mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>That the blood acquires &s;omething from the air, which is imme|diately nece&s;&s;ary to life, appears from an experiment of Dr. Hare (Philo&s;.

<P>II. Sir Edward Hul&s;e, a phy&s;ician of reputation at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, was of opinion, that the placenta was a re&s;pira|tory organ, like the gills of fi&s;h; and not an organ to &s;upply nutri|ment to the foetus; as mentioned in Derham's Phy&s;ico-theology. Many other phy&s;icians &s;eem to have e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ame opinion, as noticed by Haller. Elem. Phy&s;iologiae, T. 1. Dr. Gip&s;on publi&s;hed a defence of this theory in the Medical E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh, Vol. I. and II. which doctrine is there controverted at large by the late Alex|ander Monro; and &s;ince that time the general opinion has been, that the placenta is an organ of nutrition only, owing perhaps rather to the authority of &s;o great a name, than to the validity of the arguments adduced in its &s;upport. The &s;ubject has lately been re&s;umed by Dr. James Jeffray, and by Dr. Fore&s;ter French, in their inaugural di&s;&s;er|tations at Edinburgh and at Cambridge; who have defended the con|trary opinion in an able and ingenious manner; and from who&s;e The&s;es I have extracted many of the following remarks.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by the late di&s;coveries of Dr. Prie&s;tley, M. Lavoi&s;ier, and other philo&s;ophers, it appears, that the ba&s;is of atmo&s;pherical air, called oxygene, is received by the blood through the membranes of the lungs; and that by this addition the colour of the blood is changed from a dark to a light red. Secondly, that water po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es oxygene al&s;o as a part of its compo&s;ition, and contains air likewi&s;e in its pores; whence the blood of fi&s;h receives oxygene from the water, or from the air it contains, by means of their gills, in the &s;ame manner as the blood is oxygenated in the lungs of air-breathing animals; it changes its colour at the &s;ame time from a dark to a light red in the ve&s;&s;els of their gills, which con&s;titute a pulmonary organ adapted to the me|dium in which they live. Thirdly, that the placenta con&s;i&s;ts of ar|teries
<PB N="473" REF="487">
carrying the blood to its extremities, and a vein bringing it back, re&s;embling exactly in &s;tructure the lungs and gills above men|tioned; and that the blood changes its colour from a dark to a light red in pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>This analogy between the lungs and gills of animals, and the pla|centa of the fetus, extends through a great variety of other circum|&s;tances; thus air-breathing creatures and fi&s;h can live but a few mi|nutes without air or water; or when they are confined in &s;uch air or water, as has been &s;poiled by their own re&s;piration; the &s;ame hap|pens to the fetus, which, as &s;oon as the placenta is &s;eparated from the uterus, mu&s;t either expand its lungs, and receive air, or die. Hence from the &s;tructure, as well as the u&s;e of the placenta, it appears to be a re&s;piratory organ, like the gills of fi&s;h, by which the blood in the fetus becomes oxygenated.</P>
<P>From the terminations of the placental ve&s;&s;els not being ob&s;erved to bleed after being torn from the uterus, while tho&s;e of the uterus effu&s;e a great quantity of florid arterial blood, the terminations of the placental ve&s;&s;els would &s;eem to be in&s;erted into the arterial ones of the mother; and to receive oxygenation from the pa&s;&s;ing currents of her blood through their coats or membranes; which oxygenation is proved by the change of the colour of the blood from dark to light red in its pa&s;&s;age from the placental arteries to the placental vein.</P>
<P>The curious &s;tructure of the cavities or lacunae of the placenta, demon&s;trated by Mr. J. Hunter, explain this circum&s;tance. That in|genious philo&s;opher has &s;hewn, that there are numerous cavities or lacunae formed on that &s;ide of the placenta, which is in contact with the uterus; tho&s;e cavities or cells are filled with blood from the ma|ternal arteries, which open into them; which blood is again taken up by the maternal veins, and is thus perpetually changed. While the terminations of the placental arteries and veins are &s;pread in fine reti|culation on the &s;ides of the&s;e cells. And thus, as the growing fetus
<PB N="474" REF="488">
requires greater oxygenation, an apparatus is produced re&s;embling exactly the air-cells of the lungs.</P>
<P>In cows, and other ruminating animals, the internal &s;urface of the uterus is unequal like hollow cups, which have been called coty|ledons; and into the&s;e cavities the prominencies of the numerous pla|centas, with which the fetus of tho&s;e animals is furni&s;hed, are in|&s;erted, and &s;trictly adhere; though they may be extracted without effu&s;ion of blood. The&s;e inequalities of the uterus, and the nu|merous placentas in con&s;equence, &s;eem to be de&s;igned for the purpo&s;e of expanding a greater &s;urface for the terminations of the placental ve&s;&s;els for the purpo&s;e of receiving oxygenation from the uterine ones; as the progeny of this cla&s;s of animals are more completely formed before their nativity, than that of the carnivorous cla&s;&s;es, and mu&s;t thence in the latter weeks of pregnancy require greater oxygenation. Thus calves and lambs can walk about in a few minutes after their birth; while puppies and kittens remain many days without opening their eyes. And though on the &s;eparation of the cotyledons of ru|minating animals no blood is effu&s;ed, yet this is owing clearly to the greater power of contraction of their uterine lacunae or alveoli. See Medical E&s;&s;ays, Vol. V. page 144. And from the &s;ame cau&s;e they are not liable to a &s;anguiferous men&s;truation.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of the oxygenation of the blood in the fetus is farther illu&s;trated by the analogy of the chick in the egg; which appears to have its blood oxygenated at the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els &s;urround|ing the yolk; which are &s;pread on the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, and may ab&s;orb oxygene through that moi&s;t membrane from the air con&s;ined behind it; and which is &s;hewn by experiments in the ex|hau&s;ted receiver to be changeable through the &s;hell.</P>
<P>This analogy may even be extended to the growing &s;eeds of vege|tables; which were &s;hewn by Mr. Scheele to require a renovation of the air over the water, in which they were confined. Many vege|table
<PB N="475" REF="489">
&s;eeds are &s;urrounded with air in their pods or receptacles, as peas, the fruit of &s;taphylea, and lichnis ve&s;icaria; but it is probable, that tho&s;e &s;eeds, after they are &s;hed, as well as the &s;pawn of fi&s;h, by the &s;ituation of the former on or near the moi&s;t and aerated &s;urface of the earth, and of the latter in the ever-changing and ventilated water, may not be in need of an apparatus for the oxygenation of their fir&s;t blood, before the leaves of one, and the gills of the other, are produced for this purpo&s;e.</P>

<P N="1">III. 1. There are many arguments, be&s;ides the &s;trict analogy be|tween the liquor amnii and the albumen ovi, which &s;hew the former to be a nutritive fluid; and that the fetus in the latter months of pregnancy takes it into its &s;tomach; and that in con&s;equence the pla|centa is produced for &s;ome other important purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the liquor amnii is not an excrementitious fluid is evinced, becau&s;e it is found in greater quantity, when the fetus is young, decrea&s;ing after a certain period till birth. Haller a&s;&s;erts, "that in &s;ome animals but a &s;mall quantity of this fluid remains at the birth. In the eggs of hens it is con&s;umed on the eighteenth day, &s;o that at the exclu&s;ion of the chick &s;carcely any remains. In rabbits before birth there is none." Elem. Phy&s;iol. Had this been an ex|crementitious fluid, the contrary would probably have occurred. Secondly, the &s;kin of the fetus is covered with a whiti&s;h cru&s;t or pel|licle, which would &s;eem to preclude any idea of the liquor amnii being produced by any ex&s;udation of per&s;pirable matter. And it can|not con&s;i&s;t of urine, becau&s;e in brute animals the urachus pa&s;&s;es from the bladder to the alantois for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of carrying off that fluid; which however in the human fetus &s;eems to be retained in the di&s;tended bladder, as the feces are accumulated in the bowels of all animals.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nutritious quality of the liquid, which &s;urrounds the fetus, appears from the following con&s;iderations. 1. It is coagulable by heat, by nitrous acid, and by &s;pirit of wine, like milk, &s;erum of blood, and
<PB N="476" REF="490">
other fluids, which daily experience evinces to be nutritious. 2. It has a &s;alti&s;h ta&s;te, according to the accurate Baron Haller, not unlike the whey of milk, which it even re&s;embles in &s;mell. 3. The white of the egg which con&s;titutes the food of the chick, is &s;hewn to be nu|tritious by our daily experience; be&s;ides the experiment of its nutri|tious effects mentioned by Dr. Fordyce in his late Treati&s;e on Dige&s;|tion, p. 178; who adds, that it much re&s;embles the e&s;&s;ential parts of the &s;erum of blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. A fluid &s;imilar to the fluid, with which the fetus is &s;urrounded, except what little change may be produced by a beginning dige&s;tion, is found in the &s;tomach of the fetus; and the white of the egg is found in the &s;ame manner in the &s;tomach of the chick.</P>
<P>Numerous hairs, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of its &s;kin, are perpetually found among the contents of the &s;tomach in new-born calves; which mu&s;t therefore have licked them&s;elves before their nativity. Bla&s;ii Anatom. See Sect. XVI. 2. on In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The chick in the egg is &s;een gently to move in its &s;urrounding fluid, and to open and &s;hut its mouth alternately. The &s;ame has been ob|&s;erved in puppies. Haller's El. Phy&s;. I. 8. p. 201.</P>
<P>A column of ice has been &s;een to reach down the oe&s;ophagus from the mouth to the &s;tomach in a frozen fetus; and this ice was the liquor amnii frozen.</P>
<P>The meconium, or fir&s;t faeces, in the bowels of new-born infants evince, that &s;omething has been dige&s;ted; and what could this be but the liquor amnii together with the recrements of the ga&s;tric juice and gall, which were nece&s;&s;ary for its dige&s;tion?</P>
<P>There have been recorded &s;ome mon&s;trous births of animals with|out heads, and con&s;equently without mouths, which &s;eem to have been delivered on doubtful authority, or from inaccurate ob&s;ervation. There are two of &s;uch mon&s;trous productions however better atte&s;ted; one of a human fetus, mentioned by Gip&s;on in the Scots Medical E&s;&s;ays; which having the gula impervious was furni&s;hed with an aperture into
<PB N="477" REF="491">
the wind-pipe, which communicated below into the gullet; by means of which the liquor amnii might be taken into the &s;tomach before na|tivity without danger of &s;uffocation, while the fetus had no occa&s;ion to breathe. The other mon&s;trous fetus is de&s;cribed by Vander Wiel, who a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;aw a mon&s;trous lamb, which had no mouth; but in&s;tead of it was furni&s;hed with an opening in the lower part of the neck into the &s;tomach. Both the&s;e in&s;tances evidently favour the doc|trine of the fetus being nouri&s;hed by the mouth; as otherwi&s;e there had been no nece&s;&s;ity for new or unnatural apertures into the &s;tomach, when the natural ones were deficient?</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts and ob&s;ervations we may &s;afely infer, that the fetus in the womb is nouri&s;hed by the fluid which &s;urrounds it; which during the fir&s;t period of ge&s;tation is ab&s;orbed by the naked lacteals; and is afterwards &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach and bowels, when the&s;e organs are perfected; and la&s;tly that the placenta is an organ for the purpo&s;e of giving due oxygenation to the blood of the fetus; which is more nece&s;&s;ary, or at lea&s;t more frequently nece&s;&s;ary, than even the &s;upply of food.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion of the great Harvey becomes thus ea&s;ily an&s;wered. "Why is not the fetus in the womb &s;uffocated for want of air, when it remains there even to the tenth month without re&s;piration: yet if it be born in the &s;eventh or eighth month, and has once re&s;pired, it becomes immediately &s;uffocated for want of air, if its re&s;piration be ob&s;tructed?"</P>
<P>For further information on this &s;ubject, the reader is referred to the Tentamen Medicum of Dr. Jeffray, printed at Edinburgh in 1786. And it is hoped that Dr. French will &s;ome time give his the&s;es on this &s;ubject to the public.</P>

<P>I. Habits of acting and feeling of individuals attend the &s;oul into a future life, and at|tend the new embryon at the time of its production. The new &s;peck of entity ab|&s;orbs nutriment, and receives oxygene. Spreads the terminations of its ve&s;&s;els on cells, which communicate with the arteries of the uterus; &s;ometimes with tho&s;e of the peritoneum. Afterwards it &s;wallows the liquor amnii, which it produces by its irritation from the uterus, or peritoneum. Like in&s;ects in the heads of calves and &s;heep. Why the white of egg is of two con&s;i&s;tencies. Why nothing is found in quadrupeds &s;imilar to the yolk, nor in mo&s;t vegetable &s;eeds. II. 1. Eggs of frogs and fi&s;h impregnated out of their bodies. Eggs of fowls which are not fecun|dated, contain only the nutriment for the embryon. The embryon is produced by the male, and the nutriment by the female. Animalcula in &s;emine. Profu&s;ion of nature's births. 2. Vegetables viviparous. Buds and bulbs have each a father but no mother. Ve&s;&s;els of the leaf and bud ino&s;culate. The paternal offspring ex|actly re&s;embles the parent. 3. In&s;ects impregnated for &s;ix generations. Polypus branches like buds. Creeping roots. Viviparous flowers. Taenia, volvox. Eve from Adam's rib. Semen not a &s;timulus to the egg. III. 1. Embryons not ori|ginally created within other embryons. Organized matter is not &s;o minute. 2. All the parts of the embryon are not formed in the male parent. Crabs pro|duce their legs, worms produce their heads and tails. In wens, cancers, and in|flammations, new ve&s;&s;els are formed. Mules partake of the forms of both parents. Hair and nails grow by elongation, not by di&s;tention. 3. Organic particles of Buffon. IV. 1. Rudiment of the embryon a &s;imple living filament, becomes a living ring, and then a living tube. 2. It acquires new irritabilities, and &s;en&s;ibili|ties
<PB N="479" REF="493">
with new organizations, as in wounded &s;nails, polypi, moths, gnats, tadpoles. Hence new parts are acquired by addition not by di&s;tention. 3. All parts of the body grow if not confined. 4. Fetu&s;es deficient at their extremities, or have a du|plicature of parts. Mon&s;trous births. Double parts of vegetables. 5. Mules cannot be formed by di&s;tention of the &s;eminal ens. 6. Families of animals from a mixture of their orders. Mules imperfect. 7. Animal appetency like chemical affinity. Vis fabricatrix and medicatrix of nature. 8. The changes of animals before and after nativity. Similarity of their &s;tructure. Changes in them from lu&s;t, hunger, and danger. All warm-blooded animals derived from one living filament. Cold-blooded animals, in&s;ects, worms, vegetables, derived al&s;o from one living filament. Male animals have teats. Male pidgeon gives milk. The world it&s;elf generated. The cau&s;e of cau&s;es. A &s;tate of probation and re&s;pon&s;i|bility. V. 1. Efficient cau&s;e of the colours of birds eggs, and of hair and fea|thers, which become white in &s;nowy countries. Imagination of the female colours the egg. Ideas or motions of the retina imitated by the extremities of the nerves of touch, or rete muco&s;um. 2. Nutriment &s;upplied by the female of three kinds. Her imagination can only affect the fir&s;t kind. Mules how produced, and mulat|toes. Organs of reproduction why deficient in mules. Eggs with double yolks. VI. 1. Various &s;ecretions produced by the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els, as in the glands. Contageous matter. Many glands affected by plea&s;urable ideas, as tho&s;e which &s;ecrete the &s;emen. 2. Snails and worms are hermaphrodite, yet cannot im|pregnate them&s;elves. Final cau&s;e of this. 3. The imagination of the male forms the &s;ex. Ideas, or motions of the nerves of vi&s;ion or of touch, are imitated by the ultimate extremities of the glands of the te&s;tes, which mark the &s;ex. This effect of the imagination belongs only to the male. The &s;ex of the embryon is not owing to accident. 4. Cau&s;es of the changes in animals from imagination as in mon&s;ters. From the male. From the female. 5. Mi&s;carriages from fear. 6. Power of the imagination of the male over the colour, form, and &s;ex of the progeny. An in|&s;tance of. 7. Act of generation accompanied with ideas of the male or female form. Art of begetting beautiful children of either &s;ex. VII. Recapitulation. VIII. Conclu&s;ion. Of cau&s;e and effect.

<P>I. THE ingenious Dr. Hartley in his work on man, and &s;ome other philo&s;ophers, have been of opinion, that our immortal part ac|quires during this life certain habits of action or of &s;entiment, which become for ever indi&s;&s;oluble, continuing after death in a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence; and add, that if the&s;e habits are of the malevolent kind, they mu&s;t render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mi&s;erable even in heaven. I would apply this ingenious idea to the generation or production of the em|bryon, or new animal, which partakes &s;o much of the form and pro|pen&s;ities of the parent.</P>
<P>Owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed a <HI>new</HI> animal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent; &s;ince a part of the embryon-animal is, or was, a part of the parent; and therefore in &s;trict language it cannot be &s;aid to be entirely <HI>new</HI> at the time of its production; and therefore it may retain &s;ome of the habits of the parent-&s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>At the earlie&s;t period of its exi&s;tence the embryon, as &s;ecreted from the blood of the male, would &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t of a living filament with certain capabilities of irritation, &s;en&s;ation, volition, and a&s;&s;ociation; and al&s;o with &s;ome acquired habits or propen&s;ities peculiar to the pa|rent: the former of the&s;e are in common with other animals; the latter &s;eem to di&s;tingui&s;h or produce the kind of animal, whether man or quadruped, with the &s;imilarity of feature or form to the pa|rent. It is difficult to be conceived, that a living entity can be &s;epa|rated or produced from the blood by the action of a gland; and which &s;hall afterwards become an animal &s;imilar to that in who&s;e ve&s;&s;els it is formed; even though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e with &s;ome modern theo|ri&s;ts, that the blood is alive; yet every other hypothe&s;is concerning generation re&s;ts on principles &s;till more difficult to our comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the time of procreation this &s;peck of entity is received into an appropriated nidus, in which it mu&s;t acquire two circum&s;tances ne|ce&s;&s;ary to its life and growth; one of the&s;e is food or &s;u&s;tenance, which is to be received by the ab&s;orbent mouths of its ve&s;&s;els; and
<PB N="481" REF="495">
the other is that part of atmo&s;pherical air, or of water, which by the new chemi&s;try is termed oxygene, and which affects the blood by pa&s;&s;ing through the coats of the ve&s;&s;els which contain it. The fluid &s;urrounding the embryon in its new habitation, which is called liquor amnii, &s;upplies it with nouri&s;hment; and as &s;ome air cannot but be in|troduced into the uterus along with the new embryon, it would &s;eem that this &s;ame fluid would for a &s;hort time, &s;uppo&s;e for a few hours, &s;upply likewi&s;e a &s;ufficient quantity of the oxygene for its immediate exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>On this account the vegetable impregnation of aquatic plants is performed in the air; and it is probable that the honey-cup or nectary of vegetables requires to be open to the air, that the anthers and &s;tigmas of the flower may have food of a more oxygenated kind than the common vegetable &s;ap-juice.</P>
<P>On the introduction of this primordium of entity into the uterus the irritation of the liquor amnii, which &s;urrounds it, excites the ab|&s;orbent mouths of the new ve&s;&s;els into action; they drink up a part of it, and a plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation accompanies this new action; at the &s;ame time the chemical affinity of the oxygene acts through the ve&s;|&s;els of the rube&s;cent blood; and a previous want, or di&s;agreeable &s;en|&s;ation, is relieved by this proce&s;s.</P>
<P>As the want of this oxygenation of the blood is perpetual, (as ap|pears from the ince&s;&s;ant nece&s;&s;ity of breathing by lungs or gills,) the ve&s;&s;els become extended by the efforts of pain or de&s;ire to &s;eek this nece&s;&s;ary object of oxygenation, and to remove the di&s;agreeable &s;en|&s;ation, which that want occa&s;ions. At the &s;ame time new particles of matter are ab&s;orbed, or applied to the&s;e extended ve&s;&s;els, and they become permanently elongated, as the fluid in contact with them &s;oon loo&s;es the oxygenous part, which it at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which was ow|ing to the introduction of air along with the embryon. The&s;e new blood-ve&s;&s;els approach the &s;ides of the uterus, and penetrate with their fine terminations into the ve&s;&s;els of the mother; or adhere to them,
<PB N="482" REF="496">
acquiring oxygene through their coats from the pa&s;&s;ing currents of the arterial blood of the mother. See Sect. XXXVIII. 2.</P>
<P>This attachment of the placental ve&s;&s;els to the internal &s;ide of the uterus by their own proper efforts appears further illu&s;trated by the many in&s;tances of extra-uterine fetu&s;es, which have thus attached or in&s;erted their ve&s;&s;els into the peritoneum; or on the vi&s;cera, exactly in the &s;ame manner as they naturally in&s;ert or attach them to the uterus.</P>
<P>The ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the embryon continue to drink up nou|ri&s;hment from the fluid in which they &s;wim, or liquor amnii; and which at fir&s;t needs no previous dige&s;tive preparation; but which, when the whole apparatus of dige&s;tion becomes complete, is &s;wal|lowed by the mouth into the &s;tomach, and being mixed with &s;aliva, ga&s;tric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and mucus of the inte&s;tines, be|comes dige&s;ted, and leaves a recrement, which produces the fir&s;t feces of the infant, called meconium.</P>
<P>The liquor amnii is &s;ecreted into the uterus, as the fetus requires it, and may probably be produced by the irritation of the fetus as an extraneous body; &s;ince a &s;imilar fluid is acquired from the peritoneum in ca&s;es of extra-uterine ge&s;tation. The young caterpillars of the gadfly placed in the &s;kins of cows, and the young of the ichneumon-fly placed in the backs of the caterpillars on cabbages, &s;eem to pro|duce their nouri&s;hment by their irritating the &s;ides of their nidus. A vegetable &s;ecretion and concretion is thus produced on oak-leaves by the gall-in&s;ect, and by the cynips in the bedeguar of the ro&s;e; and by the young gra&s;shopper on many plants, by which the animal &s;ur|rounds it&s;elf with froth. But in no circum&s;tance is extra-uterine ge&s;|tation &s;o exactly re&s;embled as by the eggs of a fly, which are de|po&s;ited in the frontal &s;inus of &s;heep and calves. The&s;e eggs float in &s;ome ounces of fluid collected in a thin pellicle or hydatide. This bag of fluid compre&s;&s;es the optic nerve on one &s;ide, by which the vi&s;ion being le&s;s di&s;tinct in that eye, the animal turns in perpetual
<PB N="483" REF="497">
circles towards the &s;ide affected, in order to get a more accurate view of objects; for the &s;ame rea&s;on as in &s;quinting the affected eye is turned away from the object contemplated. Sheep in the warm months keep their no&s;es clo&s;e to the ground to prevent this fly from &s;o readily getting into their no&s;trils.</P>
<P>The liquor amnii is &s;ecreted into the womb as it is required, not only in re&s;pect to quantity, but, as the dige&s;tive powers of the fetus become formed, this fluid becomes of a different con&s;i&s;tence and qua|lity, till it is exchanged for milk after nativity. Haller. Phy&s;iol. V. 1. In the egg the white part, which is analogous to the liquor amnii of quadrupeds, con&s;i&s;ts of two di&s;tinct parts; one of which is more vi&s;cid, and probably more difficult of dige&s;tion, and more nutritive than the other; and this latter is u&s;ed in the la&s;t week of incubation. The yolk of the egg is a &s;till &s;tronger or more nutritive fluid, which is drawn up into the bowels of the chick ju&s;t at its exclu&s;ion from the &s;hell, and &s;erves it for nouri&s;hment for a day or two, till it is able to dige&s;t, and has learnt to chu&s;e the harder &s;eeds or grains, which are to afford it &s;u&s;tenance. Nothing analogous to this yolk is found in the fetus of lactiferous animals, as the milk is another nutritive fluid ready prepared for the young progeny.</P>
<P>The yolk therefore is not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;pawn of fi&s;h, the eggs of in&s;ects, or for the &s;eeds of vegetables; as their embryons have probably their food pre&s;ented to them as &s;oon as they are excluded from their &s;hells, or have extended their roots. Whence it happens that &s;ome in&s;ects produce a living progeny in the &s;pring and &s;ummer, and eggs in the autumn; and &s;ome vegetables have living roots or buds produced in the place of &s;eeds, as the polygonum viviparum, and magical onions. See Botanic Garden, p. ii. art. anthoxanthum.</P>
<P>There &s;eems however to be a re&s;ervoir of nutriment prepared for &s;ome &s;eeds be&s;ides their cotyledons or &s;eed-leaves, which may be &s;up|po&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure analogous to the yolk of the egg. Such are the &s;accharine juices of apples, grapes and other fruits, which &s;upply nu|trition

to the &s;eeds after they fall on the ground. And &s;uch is the milky juice in the centre of the coco-nut, and part of the kernel of it; the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e of all other monocotyledon &s;eeds, as of the palms, gra&s;&s;es, and lilies.</P>

<P N="1">II. 1. The proce&s;s of generation is &s;till involved in impenetrable ob&s;curity, conjectures may neverthele&s;s be formed concerning &s;ome of its circum&s;tances. Fir&s;t, the eggs of fi&s;h and frogs are impregnated, after they leave the body of the female; becau&s;e they are depo&s;ited in a fluid, and are not therefore covered with a hard &s;hell. It is how|ever remarkable, that neither frogs nor fi&s;h will part with their &s;pawn without the pre&s;ence of the male; on which account female carp and gold-fi&s;h in &s;mall ponds, where there are no males, frequently die from the di&s;tention of their growing &s;pawn. 2. The eggs of fowls, which are laid without being impregnated, are &s;een to contain only the yolk and white, which are evidently the food or &s;u&s;tenance for the future chick. 3. As the cicatricula of the&s;e eggs is given by the cock, and is evidently the rudiment of the new animal; we may con|clude, that the embryon is produced by the male, and the proper food and nidus by the female. For if the female be &s;uppo&s;ed to form an equal part of the embryon, why &s;hould &s;he form the whole of the apparatus for nutriment and for oxygenation? the male in many ani|mals is larger, &s;tronger, and dige&s;ts more food than the female, and therefore &s;hould contribute as much or more towards the reproduc|tion of the &s;pecies; but if he contributes only half the embryon, and none of the apparatus for &s;u&s;tenance and oxygenation, the divi&s;ion is unequal; the &s;trength of the male, and his con&s;umption of food are too great for the effect, compared with that of the female, which is contrary to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>In objection to this theory of generation it may be &s;aid, if the ani|malcula in &s;emine, as &s;een by the micro&s;cope, be all of them rudi|ments of homunculi, when but one of them can find a nidus, what a wa&s;te nature has made of her productions? I do not a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="485" REF="499">
that the&s;e moving particles, vi&s;ible by the micro&s;cope, are homun|ciones; perhaps they may be the creatures of &s;tagnation or putridity, or perhaps no creatures at all; but if they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be rudi|ments of homunculi, or embryons, &s;uch a profu&s;ion of them corre&s;|ponds with the general efforts of nature to provide for the continu|ance of her &s;pecies of animals. Every individual tree produces innu|merable &s;eeds, and every individual fi&s;h innumerable &s;pawn, in &s;uch inconceivable abundance as would in a &s;hort &s;pace of time crowd the earth and ocean with inhabitants; and the&s;e are much more per|fect animals than the animalcula in &s;emine can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, and peri&s;h in uncounted millions. This argument only &s;hews, that the productions of nature are governed by general laws; and that by a wi&s;e &s;uperfluity of provi&s;ion &s;he has en&s;ured their continuance.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the embryon is &s;ecreted or produced by the male, and not by the conjunction of fluids from both male and female, appears from the analogy of vegetable &s;eeds. In the large flowers, as the tulip, there is no &s;imilarity of apparatus between the anthers and the &s;tigma: the &s;eed is produced according to the ob&s;ervations of Spallanzani long before the flowers open, and in con&s;equence long before it can be im|pregnated, like the egg in the pullet. And after the prolific du&s;t is &s;hed on the &s;tigma, the &s;eed becomes coagulated in one point fir&s;t, like the cicatricula of the impregnated egg. See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note 38. Now in the&s;e &s;imple products of nature, if the female contributed to produce the new embryon equally with the male, there would probably have been &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;imilarity of parts for this purpo&s;e, be&s;ides tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for the nidus and &s;u&s;tenance of the new progeny. Be&s;ides in many flowers the males are more numerous than the females, or than the &s;eparate uterine cells in their germs, which would &s;hew, that the office of the male was at lea&s;t as impor|tant as that of the female; whereas if the female, be&s;ides producing the egg or &s;eed, was to produce an equal part of the embryon, the of|fice of reproduction would be unequally divided between them.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="500">
Add to this, that in the mo&s;t &s;imple kind of vegetable reproduction, I mean the buds of trees, which are their viviparous offspring, the leaf is evidently the parent of the bud, which ri&s;es in its bo&s;om, ac|cording to the ob&s;ervation of Linnaeus. This leaf con&s;i&s;ts of ab&s;or|bent ve&s;&s;els, and pulmonary ones, to obtain its nutriment, and to im|pregnate it with oxygene. This &s;imple piece of living organization is al&s;o furni&s;hed with a power of reproduction; and as the new offspring is thus &s;upported adhering to its father, it needs no mother to &s;upply it with a nidus, and nutriment, and oxygenation; and hence no fe|male leaf has exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I conceive that the ve&s;&s;els between the bud and the leaf communi|cate or ino&s;culate; and that the bud is thus &s;erved with vegetable blood, that is, with both nutriment and oxygenation, till the death of the parent-leaf in autumn. And in this re&s;pect it differs from the fetus of viviparous animals. Secondly, that then the bark-ve&s;&s;els belonging to the dead-leaf, and in which I &s;uppo&s;e a kind of manna to have been depo&s;ited, become now the placental ve&s;&s;els, if they may be &s;o called, of the new bud. From the vernal &s;ap thus produced of one &s;ugar-maple-tree in New-York and in Penn&s;ylvania, five or &s;ix pounds of good &s;ugar may be made annually without de&s;troying the tree. Account of maple-&s;ugar by B. Ru&s;h. London, Phillips. (See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note on vegetable placentation.)</P>
<P>The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, when the warmth of the vernal &s;un hatches the young bud, &s;erve it with a &s;accharine nutriment, till it acquires leaves of its own, and &s;hoots a new &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbents down the bark and root of the tree, ju&s;t as the farinaceous or oily matter in &s;eeds, and the &s;accharine matter in fruits, &s;erve their embryons with nutri|ment, till they acquire leaves and roots. This analogy is as force|able in &s;o ob&s;cure a &s;ubject, as it is curious, and may in large buds, as of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut, be almo&s;t &s;een by the naked eye; if with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the la&s;t year's leaf, and of the new bud in its bo&s;om, be cut away &s;lice by &s;lice. The &s;even ribs of
<PB N="487" REF="501">
the la&s;t year's leaf will be &s;een to have ari&s;en from the pith in &s;even di&s;tinct points making a curve; and the new bud to have been pro|duced in their centre, and to have pierced the alburnum and cortex, and grown without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a mother. A &s;imilar proce&s;s may be &s;een on di&s;&s;ecting a tulip-root in winter; the leaves, which inclo&s;ed the la&s;t year's flower-&s;talk, were not nece&s;&s;ary for the flower; but each of the&s;e was the father of a new bud, which may be now found at its ba&s;e; and which, as it adheres to the parent, required no mother.</P>
<P>This paternal offspring of vegetables, I mean their buds and bulbs, is attended with a very curious circum&s;tance; and that is, that they exactly re&s;emble their parents, as is ob&s;ervable in grafting fruit-trees, and in propagating flower-roots; whereas the &s;eminal offspring of plants, being &s;upplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to per|petual variation. Thus al&s;o in the vegetable cla&s;s dioicia, where the male flowers are produced on one tree, and the female ones on ano|ther; the buds of the male trees uniformly produce either male flow|ers, or other buds &s;imilar to them&s;elves; and the buds of the female trees produce either female flowers, or other buds &s;imilar to them|&s;elves; whereas the &s;eeds of the&s;e trees produce either male or fe|male plants. From this analogy of the production of vegetable buds without a mother, I contend that the mother does not contribute to the formation of the living ens in animal generation, but is nece&s;&s;ary only for &s;upplying its nutriment and oxygenation.</P>
<P>There is another vegetable fact publi&s;hed by M. Koelreuter, which he calls "a complete metamorpho&s;is of one natural &s;pecies of plants into another," which &s;hews, that in &s;eeds as well as in buds, the em|bryon proceeds from the male parent, though the form of the &s;ub&s;e|quent mature plant is in part dependant on the female. M. Koelreuter impregnated a &s;tigma of the nicotiana ru&s;tica with the farina of the ni|cotiana paniculata, and obtained prolific &s;eeds from it. With the plants which &s;prung from the&s;e &s;eeds, he repeated the experiment,
<PB N="488" REF="502">
impregnating them with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata. As the mule plants which he thus produced were prolific, he continued to impregnate them for many generations with the farina of the ni|cotiana paniculata, and they became more and more like the male pa|rent, till he at length obtained &s;ix plants in every re&s;pect perfectly &s;i|milar to the nicotiana paniculata; and in no re&s;pect re&s;embling their female parent the nicotiana ru&s;tica. <HI>Blumenbach</HI> on Generation.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is probable that the in&s;ects, which are &s;aid to require but one impregnation for &s;ix generations, as the aphis (&s;ee Amenit. Academ.) produce their progeny in the manner above de&s;cribed, that is, without a mother, and not without a father; and thus experience a lucina &s;ine concubitu. Tho&s;e who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which is found in the &s;tagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that the young ones branch out from the &s;ide of the parent like the buds of trees, and after a time &s;eparate them&s;elves from them. This is &s;o analogous to the manner in which the buds of trees appear to be produced, that the&s;e polypi may be con&s;idered as all male animals, pro|ducing embryons, which require no mother to &s;upply them with a nidus, or with nutriment, and oxygenation.</P>
<P>This lateral or lineal generation of plants, not only obtains in the buds of trees, which continue to adhere to them, but is beautifully &s;een in the wires of knot-gra&s;s, polygonum aviculare, and in tho&s;e of &s;trawberries, fragaria ve&s;ca. In the&s;e an elongated creeping bud is protruded, and, where it touches the ground, takes root, and pro|duces a new plant derived from its father, from which it acquires both nutriment and oxygenation; and in con&s;equence needs no maternal apparatus for the&s;e purpo&s;es. In viviparous flowers, as tho&s;e of al|lium magicum, and polygonum viviparum, the anthers and the &s;tig|mas become effete and peri&s;h; and the lateral or paternal offspring &s;ucceeds in&s;tead of &s;eeds, which adhere till they are &s;ufficiently ma|ture, and then fall upon the ground, and take root like other bulbs.</P>
<P>The lateral production of plants by wires, while each new plant is
<PB N="489" REF="503">
thus chained to its parent, and continues to put forth another and ano|ther, as the wire creeps onward on the ground, is exactly re&s;embled by the tape-worm, or taenia, &s;o often found in the bowels, &s;tretch|ing it&s;elf in a chain quite from the &s;tomach to the rectum. Linnaeus a&s;&s;erts, "that it grows old at one extremity, while it continues to ge|nerate young ones at the other, proceeding ad infinitum, like a root of gra&s;s. The &s;eparate joints are called gourd-worms, and propagate new joints like the parent without end, each joint being furni&s;hed with its proper mouth, and organs of dige&s;tion." Sy&s;tema naturae. Vermes tenia. In this animal there evidently appears a power of re|production without any maternal apparatus for the purpo&s;e of &s;upply|ing nutriment and oxygenation to the embryon, as it remains at|tached to its father till its maturity. The volvox globator, which is a tran&s;parent animal, is &s;aid by Linnaeus to bear within it &s;ons and grand-&s;ons to the fifth generation. The&s;e are probably living fetu&s;es, produced by the father, of different degrees of maturity, to be de|truded at different periods of time, like the unimpregnated eggs of various &s;izes, which are found in poultry; and as they are produced without any known copulation, contribute to evince, that the living embryon in other orders of animals is formed by the male-parent, and not by the mother, as one parent has the power to produce it.</P>
<P>This idea of the reproduction of animals from a &s;ingle living fila|ment of their fathers, appears to have been &s;hadowed or allegorized in the curious account in &s;acred writ of the formation of Eve from a rib of Adam.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e analogies I conclude, that the embryon is produced &s;olely by the male, and that the female &s;upplies it with a proper nidus, with &s;u&s;tenance, and with oxygenation; and that the idea of the &s;e|men of the male con&s;tituting only a &s;timulus to the egg of the fe|male, exciting it into life, (as held by &s;ome philo&s;ophers) has no &s;up|port from experiment or analogy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">III. 1. Many ingenious philo&s;ophers have found &s;o great difficulty
<PB N="490" REF="504">
in conceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals, that they have &s;uppo&s;ed all the numerous progeny to have exi&s;ted in miniature in the animal originally created; and that the&s;e infinitely minute forms are only evolved or di&s;tended, as the embryon increa&s;es in the womb. This idea, be&s;ides its being un&s;upported by any analogy we are ac|quainted with, a&s;cribes a greater tenuity to organized matter, than we can readily admit; as the&s;e included embryons are &s;uppo&s;ed each of them to con&s;i&s;t of the various and complicate parts of animal bodies: they mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a much greater degree of minutene&s;s, than that which was a&s;cribed to the devils that tempted St. Anthony; of whom 20,000 were &s;aid to have been able to dance a &s;araband on the point of the fine&s;t needle without incommoding each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. Others have &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the parts of the embryon are formed in the male, previous to its being depo&s;ited in the egg or ute|rus; and that it is then only to have its parts evolved or di&s;tended as mentioned above; but this is only to get rid of one difficulty by pro|po&s;ing another equally incomprehen&s;ible: they found it difficult to conceive, how the embryon could be formed in the uterus or egg, and therefore wi&s;hed it to be formed before it came thither. In an&s;wer to both the&s;e doctrines it may be ob&s;erved, 1&s;t, that &s;ome ani|mals, as the crab-fi&s;h, can reproduce a whole limb, as a leg which has been broken off; others, as worms and &s;nails, can reproduce a head, or a tail, when either of them has been cut away; and that hence in the&s;e animals at lea&s;t a part can be formed anew, which can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have exi&s;ted previou&s;ly in miniature.</P>
<P>Secondly, there are new parts or new ve&s;&s;els produced in many di&s;|ca&s;es, as on the cornea of the eye in ophthalmy, in wens and cancers, which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a prototype or original minia|ture in the embryon.</P>
<P>Thirdly, how could mule-animals be produced, which partake of the forms of both the parents, if the original embryon was a minia|ture exi&s;ting in the &s;emen of the male parent? if an embryon of the
<PB N="491" REF="505">
male a&s;s was only expanded, no re&s;emblance to the mare could exi&s;t in the mule.</P>
<P>This mi&s;taken idea of the exten&s;ion of parts &s;eems to have had its ri&s;e from the mature man re&s;embling the general form of the fetus; and from thence it was believed, that the parts of the fetus were di&s;tended into the man; whereas they have increa&s;ed 100 times in weight, as well as 100 times in &s;ize; now no one will call the ad|ditional 99 parts a di&s;tention of the original one part in re&s;pect to weight. Thus the uterus during pregnancy is greatly enlarged in thickne&s;s and &s;olidity as well as in capacity, and hence mu&s;t have ac|quired this additional &s;ize by accretion of new parts, not by an ex|ten&s;ion of the old ones; the familiar act of blowing up the bladder of an animal recently &s;laughtered has led our imaginations to apply this idea of di&s;tention to the increa&s;e of &s;ize from natural growth; which however mu&s;t be owing to the appo&s;ition of new parts; as it is evinc|ed from the increa&s;e of weight along with the increa&s;e of dimen&s;ion; and is even vi&s;ible to our eyes in the elongation of our hair from the colour of its ends; or when it has been dyed on the head; and in the growth of our nails from the &s;pecks &s;ometimes ob&s;ervable on them; and in the increa&s;e of the white cre&s;cent at their roots, and in the growth of new fle&s;h in wounds, which con&s;i&s;ts of new nerves as well as of new blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="3">3. La&s;tly, Mr. Buffon has with great ingenuity imagined the ex|i&s;tence of certain organic particles, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be partly alive, and partly mechanic &s;prings. The latter of the&s;e were di&s;co|vered by Mr. Needham in the milt or male organ of a &s;pecies of cuttle fi&s;h, called calmar; the former, or living animalcula, are found in both male and female &s;ecretions, in the infu&s;ions of &s;eeds, as of pep|per, in the jelly of roa&s;ted veal, and in all other animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e organic particles he &s;uppo&s;es to exi&s;t in the &s;per|matic fluids of both &s;exes, and that they are derived thither from every part of the body, and mu&s;t therefore re&s;emble, as he &s;uppo&s;es,
<PB N="492" REF="506">
the parts from whence they are derived. The&s;e organic particles he believes to be in con&s;tant activity, till they become mixed in the womb, and then they in&s;tantly join and produce an embryon or fetus &s;imilar to the two parents.</P>
<P>Many objections might be adduced to this fanciful theory, I &s;hall only mention two. Fir&s;t, that it is analogous to no known animal laws. And &s;econdly, that as the&s;e fluids, replete with organic par|ticles derived both from the male and female organs, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;imilar; there is no rea&s;on why the mother &s;hould not produce a female embryon without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the male, and realize the lucina &s;ine concubitu.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1">IV. 1. I conceive the primordium, or rudiment of the embryon, as &s;ecreted from the blood of the parent, to con&s;i&s;t of a &s;imple living filament as a mu&s;cular fibre; which I &s;uppo&s;e to be an extremity of a nerve of loco-motion, as a fibre of the retina is an extremity of a nerve of &s;en&s;ation; as for in&s;tance one of the fibrils, which compo&s;e the mouth of an ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;el; I &s;uppo&s;e this living filament, of whatever form it may be, whether &s;phere, cube, or cylinder, to be endued with the capability of being excited into action by certain kinds of &s;timulus. By the &s;timulus of the &s;urrounding fluid, in which it is received from the male, it may bend into a ring; and thus form the beginning of a tube. Such moving filaments, and &s;uch rings, are de&s;cribed by tho&s;e, who have attended to micro&s;copic animalcula. This living ring may now embrace or ab&s;orb a nutritive particle of the fluid, in which it &s;wims; and by drawing it into its pores, or joining it by compre&s;&s;ion to its extremities, may increa&s;e its own length or cra&s;&s;itude; and by degrees the living ring may become a living tube.</P>
<P N="2">2. With this new organization, or accretion of parts, new kinds of irritability may commence; for &s;o long as there was but one living organ, it could only be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s irritability; &s;ince &s;en&s;ibility may be conceived to be an exten&s;ion of the effect of irritability over
<PB N="493" REF="507">
the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e new kinds of irritability and of &s;en&s;i|bility in con&s;equence of new organization, appear from variety of facts in the more mature animal; thus the formation of the te&s;tes, and con&s;equent &s;ecretion of the &s;emen, occa&s;ion the pa&s;&s;ion of lu&s;t; the lungs mu&s;t be previou&s;ly formed before their exertions to obtain fre&s;h air can exi&s;t; the throat or oe&s;ophagus mu&s;t be formed previous to the &s;en&s;ation or appetites of hunger and thir&s;t; one of which &s;eems to re&s;ide at the upper end, and the other at the lower end of that canal.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o the glans penis, when it is di&s;tended with blood, ac|quires a new &s;en&s;ibility, and a new appetency. The &s;ame occurs to the nipples of the brea&s;ts of female animals, when they are di&s;tended with blood, they acquire the new appetency of giving milk. So in|flamed tendons and membranes, and even bones, acquire new &s;en&s;a|tions; and the parts of mutilated animals, as of wounded &s;nails, and polypi, and crabs, are reproduced; and at the &s;ame time acquire &s;en|&s;ations adapted to their &s;ituations. Thus when the head of a &s;nail is reproduced after decollation with a &s;harp ra&s;or, tho&s;e curious tele&s;co|pic eyes are al&s;o reproduced, and acquire their &s;en&s;ibility to light, as well as their adapted mu&s;cles for retraction on the approach of injury.</P>
<P>With every new change, therefore, of organic form, or addition of organic parts, I &s;uppo&s;e a new kind of irritability or of &s;en&s;ibility to be produced; &s;uch varieties of irritability or of &s;en&s;ibility exi&s;t in our adult &s;tate in the glands; every one of which is furni&s;hed with an irritability, or a ta&s;te, or appetency, and a con&s;equent mode of action peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this manner I conceive the ve&s;&s;els of the jaws to produce tho&s;e of the teeth, tho&s;e of the fingers to produce the nails, tho&s;e of the &s;kin to produce the hair; in the &s;ame manner as afterwards about the age of puberty the beard and other great changes in the form of the body, and di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, are produced in con&s;equence of the
<PB N="494" REF="508">
new &s;ecretion of &s;emen; for if the animal is deprived of this &s;ecretion tho&s;e changes do not take place. The&s;e changes I conceive to be formed not by elongation or di&s;tention of primeval &s;tamina, but by appo&s;ition of parts; as the mature crab-fi&s;h, when deprived of a limb, in a certain &s;pace of time has power to regenerate it; and the tadpole puts forth its feet long after its exclu&s;ion from the &s;pawn; and the caterpillar in changing into a butterfly acquires a new form, with new powers, new &s;en&s;ations, and new de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The natural hi&s;tory of butterflies, and moths, and beetles, and gnats, is full of curio&s;ity; &s;ome of them pa&s;s many months, and others even years, in their caterpillar or grub &s;tate; they then re&s;t many weeks without food, &s;u&s;pended in the air, buried in the earth, or &s;ubmer&s;ed in water; and change them&s;elves during this time into an animal apparently of a different nature; the &s;tomachs of &s;ome of them, which before dige&s;ted vegetable leaves or roots, now only di|ge&s;t honey; they have acquired wings for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeking this new food, and a long probo&s;cis to collect it from flowers, and I &s;up|po&s;e a &s;en&s;e of &s;mell to detect the &s;ecret places in flowers, where it is formed. The moths, which fly by night, have a much longer pro|bo&s;cis rolled up under their chins like a watch &s;pring; which they extend to collect the honey from flowers in their &s;leeping &s;tate; when they are clo&s;ed, and the nectaries in con&s;equence more difficult to be plundered. The beetle kind are furni&s;hed with an external covering of a hard material to their wings, that they may occa&s;ionally again make holes in the earth, in which they pa&s;&s;ed the former &s;tate of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But what mo&s;t of all di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e new animals is, that they are new furni&s;hed with the powers of reproduction; and that they now differ from each other in &s;ex, which does not appear in their caterpillar or grub &s;tate. In &s;ome of them the change from a cater|pillar into a butterfly or moth &s;eems to be accompli&s;hed for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of their propagation; &s;ince they immediately die after this is
<PB N="495" REF="509">
fini&s;hed, and take no food in the interim, as the &s;ilk-worm in this climate; though it is po&s;&s;ible, it might take honey as food, if it was pre&s;ented to it. For in general it would &s;eem, that food of a more &s;timulating kind, the honey of vegetables in&s;tead of their leaves, was nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of the &s;eminal reproduction of the&s;e animals, exactly &s;imilar to what happens in vegetables; in the&s;e the juices of the earth are &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e of reproduction by buds or bulbs; in which the new plant &s;eems to be formed by irritative mo|tions, like the growth of their other parts, as their leaves or roots; but for the purpo&s;e of &s;eminal or amatorial reproduction, where &s;en&s;a|tion is required, a more &s;timulating food becomes nece&s;&s;ary for the anther, and &s;tigma; and this food is honey; as explained in Sect. XIII. on Vegetable Animation.</P>
<P>The gnat and the tadpole re&s;emble each other in their change from natant animals with gills into aerial animals with lungs; and in their change of the element in which they live; and probably of the food, with which they are &s;upported; and la&s;tly, with their acquiring in their new &s;tate the difference of &s;ex, and the organs of &s;eminal or ama|torial reproduction. While the polypus, who is their companion in their former &s;tate of life, not being allowed to change his form and element, can only propagate like vegetable buds by the &s;ame kind of irritative motions, which produces the growth of his own body, with|out the &s;eminal or amatorial propagation, which requires &s;en&s;ation; and which in gnats and tadpoles &s;eems to require a change both of food and of re&s;piration.</P>
<P>From hence I conclude, that with the acqui&s;ition of new parts, new &s;en&s;ations, and new de&s;ires, as well as new powers, are pro|duced; and this by accretion to the old ones, and not by di&s;tention of them. And finally, that the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as the brain for the purpo&s;e of di&s;tributing the power of life, and the placenta for the purpo&s;e of oxygenating the blood, and the additional ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els for the purpo&s;e of acquiring aliment, are fir&s;t formed
<PB N="496" REF="510">
by the irritations above mentioned, and by the plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ations attending tho&s;e irritations, and by the exertions in con&s;equence of painful &s;en&s;ations, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of hunger and &s;uffocation. After the&s;e an apparatus of limbs for future u&s;es, or for the purpo&s;e of moving the body in its pre&s;ent natant &s;tate, and of lungs for future re&s;piration, and of te&s;tes for future reproduction, are formed by the irritations and &s;en&s;ations, and con&s;equent exertions of the parts pre|viou&s;ly exi&s;ting, and to which the new parts are to be attached.</P>
<P N="3">3. In confirmation of the&s;e ideas it may be ob&s;erved, that all the parts of the body endeavour to grow, or to make additional parts to them&s;elves throughout our lives; but are re&s;trained by the parts im|mediately containing them; thus, if the &s;kin be taken away, the fle&s;hy parts beneath &s;oon &s;hoot out new granulations, called by the vulgar proud fle&s;h. If the perio&s;teum be removed, a &s;imilar growth commences from the bone. Now in the ca&s;e of the imperfect embryon, the containing or confining parts are not yet &s;uppo&s;ed to be formed, and hence there is nothing to re&s;train its growth.</P>
<P N="4">4. By the parts of the embryon being thus produced by new ap|po&s;itions, many phenomena both of animal and vegetable productions receive an ea&s;ier explanation; &s;uch as that many fetu&s;es are deficient at the extremities, as in a finger or a toe, or in the end of the tongue, or in what is called a hare-lip with deficiency of the palate. For if there &s;hould be a deficiency in the quantity of the fir&s;t nutritive par|ticles laid up in the egg for the reception of the fir&s;t living filament, the extreme parts, as being la&s;t formed, mu&s;t &s;hew this deficiency by their being imperfect.</P>
<P>This idea of the growth of the embryon accords al&s;o with the pro|duction of &s;ome mon&s;trous births, which con&s;i&s;t of a duplicature of the limbs, as chickens with four legs; which could not occur, if the fetus was formed by the di&s;tention of an original &s;tamen, or minia|ture. For if there &s;hould be a &s;uperfluity of the fir&s;t nutritive par|ticles laid up in the egg for the fir&s;t living filament; it is ea&s;y to con|ceive,
<PB N="497" REF="511">
that a duplicature of &s;ome parts may be formed. And that &s;uch &s;uperfluous nouri&s;hment &s;ometimes exi&s;ts, is evinced by the double yolks in &s;ome eggs, which I &s;uppo&s;e were thus formed previ|ous to their impregnation by the exuberant nutriment of the hen.</P>
<P>This idea is confirmed by the analogy of the mon&s;ters in the ve|getable world al&s;o; in which a duplicate or triplicate production of various parts of the flower is ob&s;ervable, as a triple nectary in &s;ome columbines, and a triple petal in &s;ome primro&s;es; and which are &s;up|po&s;ed to be produced by abundant nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the embryon be received into a fluid, who&s;e &s;timulus is dif|ferent in &s;ome degree from the natural, as in the production of mule|animals, the new irritabilities or &s;en&s;ibilities acquired by the increa&s;ing or growing organized parts may differ, and thence produce parts not &s;imilar to the father, but of a kind belonging in part to the mother; and thus, though the original &s;tamen or living ens was derived totally from the father, yet new irritabilities or &s;en&s;ibilities being excited, a change of form corre&s;ponding with them will be produced. Nor could the production of mules exi&s;t, if the &s;tamen or miniature of all the parts of the embryon is previou&s;ly formed in the male &s;emen, and is only di&s;tended by nouri&s;hment in the female uterus. Whereas this difficulty cea&s;es, if the embryon be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of a living fila|ment, which acquires or makes new parts with new irritabilities, as it advances in its growth.</P>
<P>The form, &s;olidity, and colour, of the particles of nutriment laid up for the reception of the fir&s;t living filament, as well as their pecu|liar kind of &s;timulus, may contribute to produce a difference in the form, &s;olidity, and colour of the fetus, &s;o as to re&s;emble the mother, as it advances in life. This al&s;o may e&s;pecially happen during the fir&s;t &s;tate of the exi&s;tence of the embryon, before it has acquired or|gans, which can change the&s;e fir&s;t nutritive particles, as explained in No. 5. 2. of this Section. And as the&s;e nutritive particles are &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="498" REF="512">
to be &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which are formed for her own nutrition, it follows that the fetus &s;hould &s;o far re&s;emble the mother.</P>
<P>This explains, why hereditary di&s;ea&s;es may be derived either from the male or female parent, as well as the peculiar form of either of their bodies. Some of the&s;e hereditary di&s;ea&s;es are &s;imply owing to a deficient activity of a part of the &s;y&s;tem, as of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which open into the cells or cavities of the body, and thus occa&s;ion drop&s;ies. Others are at the &s;ame time owing to an increa&s;e of &s;en&s;a|tion, as in &s;crophula and con&s;umption; in the&s;e the ob&s;truction of the fluids is fir&s;t cau&s;ed by the inirritability of the ve&s;&s;els, and the inflam|mation and ulcers which &s;ucceed, are cau&s;ed by the con&s;equent in|crea&s;e of &s;en&s;ation in the ob&s;tructed part. Other hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, as the epilep&s;y, and other convul&s;ions, con&s;i&s;t in too great voluntary exertions in con&s;equence of di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation in &s;ome particular di&s;ea&s;ed part. Now as the pains, which occa&s;ion the&s;e convul&s;ions, are owing to defect of the action of the di&s;ea&s;ed part, as &s;hewn in Sect. XXXIV. it is plain, that all the&s;e hereditary di&s;ea&s;es may have their origin either from defective irritability derived from the father, or from deficiency of the &s;timulus of the nutriment derived from the mother. In either ca&s;e the effect would be &s;imilar; as a &s;crophulous race is frequently produced among the poor from the deficient &s;timu|lus of bad diet, or of hunger; and among the rich, by a deficient ir|ritability from their having been long accu&s;tomed to too great &s;timulus, as of vinous &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="6">6. From this account of reproduction it appears, that all animals have a &s;imilar origin, viz. from a &s;ingle living filament; and that the difference of their forms and qualities has ari&s;en only from the dif|ferent irritabilities and &s;en&s;ibilities, or voluntarities, or a&s;&s;ociabilities, of this original living filament; and perhaps in &s;ome degree from the different forms of the particles of the fluids, by which it has been at fir&s;t &s;timulated into activity. And that from hence, as Linnaeus has
<PB N="499" REF="513">
conjectured in re&s;pect to the vegetable world, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but the great variety of &s;pecies of animals, which now tenant the earth, may have had their origin from the mixture of a few natural orders. And that tho&s;e animal and vegetable mules, which could continue their &s;pecies, have done &s;o, and con&s;titute the numerous families of animals and vegetables which now exi&s;t; and that tho&s;e mules, which were produced with imperfect organs of generation, peri&s;hed without reproduction, according to the ob&s;ervation of Ari|&s;totle; and are the animals, which we now call mules. See Botanic Garden, Part II. Note on Dianthus.</P>
<P>Such a promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e of animals is &s;aid to exi&s;t at this day in New South Wales by Captain Hunter. And that not only among&s;t the quadrupeds and birds of different kinds, but even among&s;t the fi&s;h, and, as he believes, among&s;t the vegetables. He &s;peaks of an animal between the opo&s;&s;um and the kangaroo, from the &s;ize of a &s;heep to that of a rat. Many fi&s;h &s;eemed to partake of the &s;hark; &s;ome with a &s;kait's head and &s;houlders, and the hind part of a &s;hark; others with a &s;hark's head and the body of a mullet; and &s;ome with a &s;hark's head and the flat body of a &s;ting-ray. Many birds partake of the parrot; &s;ome have the head, neck, and bill of a parrot, with long &s;traight feet and legs; others with legs and feet of a parrot, with head and neck of a &s;ea-gull. Voyage to South Wales by Captain John Hunter, p. 68.</P>
<P N="7">7. All animals therefore, I contend, have a &s;imilar cau&s;e of their organization, originating from a &s;ingle living filament, endued indeed with different kinds of irritabilities and &s;en&s;ibilities, or of animal ap|petencies; which exi&s;t in every gland, and in every moving organ of the body, and are as e&s;&s;ential to living organization as chemical affini|ties are to certain combinations of inanimate matter.</P>
<P>If I might be indulged to make a &s;imile in a philo&s;ophical work, I &s;hould &s;ay, that the animal appetencies are not only perhaps le&s;s nu|merous originally than the chemical affinities; but that like the&s;e lat|ter,
<PB N="500" REF="514">
they change with every new combination; thus vital air and azote, when combined, produce nitrous acid; which now acquires the property of di&s;&s;olving &s;ilver; &s;o with every new additional part to the embryon, as of the throat or lungs, I &s;uppo&s;e a new animal ap|petency to be produced.</P>
<P>In this early formation of the embryon from the irritabilities, &s;en|&s;ibilities, and a&s;&s;ociabilities, and con&s;equent appetencies, the faculty of volition can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had its birth. For about what can the fetus deliberate, when it has no choice of objects? But in the more advanced &s;tate of the fetus, it evidently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es volition; as it frequently changes its attitude, though it &s;eems to &s;leep the greate&s;t part of its time; and afterwards the power of volition con|tributes to change or alter many parts of the body during its growth to manhood, by our early modes of exertion in the various depart|ments of life. All the&s;e faculties then con&s;titute the vis fabricatrix, and the vis con&s;ervatrix, as well as the vis medicatrix of nature, &s;o much &s;poken of, but &s;o little under&s;tood by philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P N="8">8. When we revolve in our minds, fir&s;t, the great changes, which we &s;ee naturally produced in animals after their nativity, as in the production of the butterfly with painted wings from the crawling ca|terpillar; or of the re&s;piring frog from the &s;ubnatant tadpole; from the feminine boy to the bearded man, and from the infant girl to the lacte&s;cent woman; both which changes may be prevented by certain mutilations of the glands nece&s;&s;ary to reproduction.</P>
<P>Secondly, when we think over the great changes introduced into various animals by artificial or accidental cultivation, as in hor&s;es, which we have exerci&s;ed for the different purpo&s;es of &s;trength or &s;wiftne&s;s, in carrying burthens or in running races; or in dogs, which have been cultivated for &s;trength and courage, as the bull-dog; or for acutene&s;s of his &s;en&s;e of &s;mell, as the hound and &s;paniel; or for the &s;wiftne&s;s of his foot, as the greyhound; or for his &s;wimming in the water, or for drawing &s;now-&s;ledges, as the rough-haired dogs of
<PB N="501" REF="515">
the north; or la&s;tly, as a play-dog for children, as the lap-dog; with the changes of the forms of the cattle, which have been dome&s;ticated from the greate&s;t antiquity, as camels, and &s;heep; which have un|dergone &s;o total a transformation, that we are now ignorant from what &s;pecies of wild animals they had their origin. Add to the&s;e the great changes of &s;hape and colour, which we daily &s;ee produced in &s;maller animals from our dome&s;tication of them, as rabbits, or pid|geons; or from the difference of climates and even of &s;ea&s;ons; thus the &s;heep of warm climates are covered with hair in&s;tead of wool; and the hares and partridges of the latitudes, which are long buried in &s;now, become white during the winter months; add to the&s;e the various changes produced in the forms of mankind, by their early modes of exertion; or by the di&s;ea&s;es occa&s;ioned by their habits of life; both of which became hereditary, and that through many ge|nerations. Tho&s;e who labour at the anvil, the oar, or the loom, as well as tho&s;e who carry &s;edan-chairs, or who have been educated to dance upon the rope, are di&s;tingui&s;hable by the &s;hape of their limbs; and the di&s;ea&s;es occa&s;ioned by intoxication deform the countenance with leprous eruptions, or the body with tumid vi&s;cera, or the joints with knots and di&s;tortions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the &s;pecies of animals before their nativity; the&s;e are &s;uch as re&s;emble the form or colour of their parents, which have been altered by the cultivation or accidents above related, and are thus continued to their po&s;terity. Or they are changes produced by the mixture of &s;pecies as in mules; or changes produced probably by the exuberance of nou|ri&s;hment &s;upplied to the fetus, as in mon&s;trous births with additional limbs; many of the&s;e enormities of &s;hape are propagated, and conti|nued as a variety at lea&s;t, if not as a new &s;pecies of animal. I have &s;een a breed of cats with an additional claw on every foot; of poultry al&s;o with an additional claw, and with wings to their feet; and of others without rumps. Mr. Buffon mentions a breed of dogs without
<PB N="502" REF="516">
tails, which are common at Rome and at Naples, which he &s;uppo&s;es to have been produced by a cu&s;tom long e&s;tabli&s;hed of cutting their tails clo&s;e off. There are many kinds of pidgeons, admired for their peculiarities, which are mon&s;ters thus produced and propagated. And to the&s;e mu&s;t be added, the changes produced by the imagination of the male parent, as will be treated of more at large in No. VI. of this Section.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider all the&s;e changes of animal form, and innumer|able others, which may be collected from the books of natural hi&s;tory; we cannot but be convinced, that the fetus or embryon is formed by appo&s;ition of new parts, and not by the di&s;tention of a primordial ne&s;t of germs, included one within another, like the cups of a conjurer.</P>
<P>Fourthly, when we revolve in our minds the great &s;imilarity of &s;tructure, which obtains in all the warm-blooded animals, as well quadrupeds, birds, and amphibious animals, as in mankind; from the mou&s;e and bat to the elephant and whale; one is led to conclude, that they have alike been produced from a &s;imilar living filament. In &s;ome this filament in its advance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers, with a fine &s;en&s;e of touch, as in mankind. In others it has acquired claws or talons, as in tygers and eagles. In others, toes with an intervening web, or membrane, as in &s;eals and gee&s;e. In others it has acquired cloven hoofs, as in cows and &s;wine; and whole hoofs in others, as in the hor&s;e. While in the bird kind this original living filament has put forth wings in&s;tead of arms or legs, and feathers in&s;tead of hair. In &s;ome it has protruded horns on the forehead in&s;tead of teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw; in others tu&s;hes in&s;tead of horns; and in others beaks in&s;tead of either. And all this exactly as is daily &s;een in the tran&s;mutations of the tadpole, which acquires legs and lungs, when he wants them; and lo&s;es his tail, when it is no longer of &s;er|vice to him.</P>
<P>Fifthly, from their fir&s;t rudiment, or primordium, to the termi|nation of their lives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations;
<PB N="503" REF="517">
which are in part produced by their own exertions in con&s;equence of their de&s;ires and aver&s;ions, of their plea&s;ures and their pains, or of ir|ritations, or of a&s;&s;ociations; and many of the&s;e acquired forms or pro|pen&s;ities are tran&s;mitted to their po&s;terity. See Sect. XXXI. 1.</P>
<P>As air and water are &s;upplied to animals in &s;ufficient profu&s;ion, the three great objects of de&s;ire, which have changed the forms of many animals by their exertions to gratify them, are tho&s;e of lu&s;t, hunger, and &s;ecurity. A great want of one part of the animal world has con|&s;i&s;ted in the de&s;ire of the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the females; and the&s;e have acquired weapons to combat each other for this purpo&s;e, as the very thick, &s;hield-like, horny &s;kin on the &s;houlder of the boar is a de|fence only again&s;t animals of his own &s;pecies, who &s;trike obliquely upwards, nor are his tu&s;hes for other purpo&s;es, except to defend him|&s;elf, as he is not naturally a carnivorous animal. So the horns of the &s;tag are &s;harp to offend his adver&s;ary, but are branched for the pur|po&s;e of parrying or receiving the thru&s;ts of horns &s;imilar to his own, and have therefore been formed for the purpo&s;e of combating other &s;tags for the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the females; who are ob&s;erved, like the ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car of the victor.</P>
<P>The birds, which do not carry food to their young, and do not therefore marry, are armed with &s;purs for the purpo&s;e of fighting for the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the females, as cocks and quails. It is cer|tain that the&s;e weapons are not provided for their defence again&s;t other adver&s;aries, becau&s;e the females of the&s;e &s;pecies are without this ar|mour. The final cau&s;e of this conte&s;t among&s;t the males &s;eems to be, that the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active animal &s;hould propagate the &s;pecies, which &s;hould thence become improved.</P>
<P>Another great want con&s;i&s;ts in the means of procuring food, which has diver&s;ified the forms of all &s;pecies of animals. Thus the no&s;e of the &s;wine has become hard for the purpo&s;e of turning up the &s;oil in
<PB N="504" REF="518">
&s;earch of in&s;ects and of roots. The trunk of the elephant is an elonga|tion of the no&s;e for the purpo&s;e of pulling down the branches of trees for his food, and for taking up water without bending his knees. Bea&s;ts of prey have acquired &s;trong jaws or talons. Cattle have ac|quired a rough tongue and a rough palate to pull off the blades of gra&s;s, as cows and &s;heep. Some birds have acquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquired beaks adapted to break the harder &s;eeds, as &s;parrows. Others for the &s;ofter &s;eeds of flowers, or the buds of trees, as the finches. Other birds have acquired long beaks to penetrate the moi&s;ter &s;oils in &s;earch of in&s;ects or roots, as woodcocks; and others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes, and to retain aquatic in&s;ects. All which &s;eem to have been gradually pro|duced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of the crea|tures to &s;upply the want of food, and to have been delivered to their po&s;terity with con&s;tant improvement of them for the purpo&s;es re|quired.</P>
<P>The third great want among&s;t animals is that of &s;ecurity, which &s;eems much to have diver&s;ified the forms of their bodies and the colour of them; the&s;e con&s;i&s;t in the means of e&s;caping other animals more powerful than them&s;elves. Hence &s;ome animals have acquired wings in&s;tead of legs, as the &s;maller birds, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;cape. Others great length of fin, or of membrane, as the flying fi&s;h, and the bat. Others great &s;wiftne&s;s of foot, as the hare. Others have acquired hard or armed &s;hells, as the tortoi&s;e and the echinus marinus.</P>
<P>The contrivances for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecurity extend even to ve|getables, as is &s;een in the wonderful and various means of their con|cealing or defending their honey from in&s;ects, and their &s;eeds from birds. On the other hand &s;wiftne&s;s of wing has been acquired by hawks and &s;wallows to pur&s;ue their prey; and a probo&s;cis of admirable &s;tructure has been acquired by the bee, the moth, and the humming bird, for the purpo&s;e of plundering the nectaries of flowers. All
<PB N="505" REF="519">
which &s;eem to have been formed by the original living filament, ex|cited into action by the nece&s;&s;ities of the creatures, which po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and on which their exi&s;tence depends.</P>
<P>From thus meditating on the great &s;imilarity of the &s;tructure of the warm-blooded animals, and at the &s;ame time of the great changes they undergo both before and after their nativity; and by con&s;idering in how minute a portion of time many of the changes of animals above de&s;cribed have been produced; would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, &s;ince the earth began to exi&s;t, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the hi&s;tory of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have ari&s;en from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, at|tended with new propen&s;ities, directed by irritations, &s;en&s;ations, vo|litions, and a&s;&s;ociations; and thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down tho&s;e improvements by generation to its po&s;terity, world without end!</P>
<P>Sixthly, The cold-blooded animals, as the fi&s;h-tribes, which are furni&s;hed with but one ventricle of the heart, and with gills in&s;tead of lungs, and with fins in&s;tead of feet or wings, bear a great &s;imila|rity to each other; but they differ, neverthele&s;s, &s;o much in their general &s;tructure from the warm-blooded animals, that it may not &s;eem probable at fir&s;t view, that the &s;ame living filament could have given origin to this kingdom of animals, as to the former. Yet are there &s;ome creatures, which unite or partake of both the&s;e orders of animation, as the whales and &s;eals; and more particularly the frog, who changes from an aquatic animal furni&s;hed with gills to an aerial one furni&s;hed with lungs.</P>
<P>The numerous tribes of in&s;ects without wings, from the &s;pider to the &s;corpion, from the flea to the lob&s;ter; or with wings, from the gnat and the ant to the wa&s;p and the dragon-fly, differ &s;o totally from
<PB N="506" REF="520">
each other, and from the red-blooded cla&s;&s;es above de&s;cribed, both in the forms of their bodies, and their modes of life; be&s;ides the organ of &s;en&s;e, which they &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s in their antennae or horns, to which it has been thought by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, that other creatures have nothing &s;imilar; that it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that this na|tion of animals could have been produced by the &s;ame kind of living filament, as the red-blooded cla&s;&s;es above mentioned. And yet the changes which many of them undergo in their early &s;tate to that of their maturity, are as different, as one animal can be from another. As tho&s;e of the gnat, which pa&s;&s;es his early &s;tate in water, and then &s;tretching out his new wings, and expanding his new lungs, ri&s;es in the air; as of the caterpillar, and bee-nymph, which feed on ve|getable leaves or farina, and at length bur&s;ting from their &s;elf-formed graves, become beautiful winged inhabitants of the &s;kies, journey|ing from flower to flower, and nouri&s;hed by the ambro&s;ial food of honey.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another cla&s;s of animals, which are termed vermes by Linnaeus, which are without feet, or brain, and are hermaphro|dites, as worms, leeches, &s;nails, &s;hell-fi&s;h, coralline in&s;ects, and &s;ponges; which po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;imple&s;t &s;tructure of all animals, and ap|pear totally different from tho&s;e already de&s;cribed. The &s;implicity of their &s;tructure, however, can afford no argument again&s;t their having been produced from a living filament as above contended.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all the various tribes of vegetables are to be enumerated among&s;t the inferior orders of animals. Of the&s;e the anthers and &s;tigmas have already been &s;hewn to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome organs of &s;en&s;e, to be nouri&s;hed by honey, and to have the power of generation like in&s;ects, and have thence been announced among&s;t the animal kingdom in Sect. XIII. and to the&s;e mu&s;t be added the buds and bulbs which con|&s;titute the viviparous offspring of vegetation. The former I &s;uppo&s;e to be beholden to a &s;ingle living filament for their &s;eminal or amato|rial procreation; and the latter to the &s;ame cau&s;e for their lateral or
<PB N="507" REF="521">
branching generation, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with the poly|pus, taenia, and volvox; and the &s;implicity of which is an argument in favour of the &s;imilarity of its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Linnaeus &s;uppo&s;es, in the Introduction to his Natural Orders, that very few vegetables were at fir&s;t created, and that their numbers were increa&s;ed by their intermarriages, and adds, &s;uadent haec Crea|toris leges a &s;implicibus ad compo&s;ita. Many other changes &s;eem to have ari&s;en in them by their perpetual conte&s;t for light and air above ground, and for food or moi&s;ture beneath the &s;oil. As noted in Bo|tanic Garden, Part II. Note on Cu&s;cuta. Other changes of vege|tables from climate, or other cau&s;es, are remarked in the Note on Curcuma in the &s;ame work. From the&s;e one might be led to ima|gine, that each plant at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ingle bulb or flower to each root, as the gentianella and dai&s;y; and that in the conte&s;t for air and light new buds grew on the old decaying flower &s;tem, &s;hooting down their elongated roots to the ground, and that in proce&s;s of ages tall trees were thus formed, and an individual bulb became a &s;warm of vegetables. Other plants, which in this conte&s;t for light and air were too &s;lender to ri&s;e by their own &s;trength, learned by degrees to adhere to their neighbours, either by putting forth roots like the ivy, or by tendrils like the vine, or by &s;piral contortions like the honey|&s;uckle; or by growing upon them like the mi&s;leto, and taking nou|ri&s;hment from their barks; or by only lodging or adhering on them, and deriving nouri&s;hment from the air, as tilland&s;ia.</P>
<P>Shall we then &s;ay that the vegetable living filament was originally different from that of each tribe of animals above de&s;cribed? And that the productive living filament of each of tho&s;e tribes was different ori|ginally from the other? Or, as the earth and ocean were probably peopled with vegetable productions long before the exi&s;tence of ani|mals; and many families of the&s;e animals long before other families of them, &s;hall we conjecture, that one and the &s;ame kind of living filaments is and has been the cau&s;e of all organic life?</P>

This idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world accords with the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers, who have &s;uppo&s;ed that the continent of America has been rai&s;ed out of the ocean at a later period of time than the other three quarters of the globe, which they deduce from the greater comparative heights of its mountains, and the con&s;equent greater coldne&s;s of its re&s;pective climates, and from the le&s;s &s;ize and &s;trength of its animals, as the tygers and allegators compared with tho&s;e of A&s;ia or Africa.

<P>This idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world &s;eems not to have been unknown to the ancient philo&s;ophers. Plato having probably ob&s;erved the reciprocal generation of inferior animals, as &s;nails and worms, was of opinion, that mankind with all other animals were originally hermaphrodites during the infancy of the world, and were in proce&s;s of time &s;eparated into male and female. The brea&s;ts and teats of all male quadrupeds, to which no u&s;e can be now a&s;&s;igned, adds perhaps &s;ome &s;hadow of probability to this opi|nion. Linnaeus excepts the hor&s;e from the male quadrupeds, who have teats; which might have &s;hewn the earlier origin of his ex|i&s;tence; but Mr. T. Hunter a&s;&s;erts, that he has di&s;covered the ve&s;|tiges of them on his &s;heath, and has at the &s;ame time enriched natural hi&s;tory with a very curious fact concerning the male pidgeon; at the time of hatching the eggs both the male and female pidgeon undergo a great change in their crops; which thicken and become corrugated, and &s;ecrete a kind of milky fluid, which coagulates, and with which alone they for a few days feed their young, and afterwards feed them with this coagulated fluid mixed with other food. How this re&s;em|bles the brea&s;ts of female quadrupeds after the production of their young! and how extraordinary, that the male &s;hould at this time give milk as well as the female! See Botanic Garden, Part II. Note on Curcuma.</P>

The late Mr. David Hume, in his po&s;thumous works, places the powers of generation much above tho&s;e of our boa&s;ted rea&s;on; and adds, that rea&s;on can only make a machine, as a clock or a &s;hip, but the power of generation makes the maker of the machine; and pro|bably from having ob&s;erved, that the greate&s;t part of the earth has been formed out of organic recrements; as the immen&s;e beds of lime|&s;tone, chalk, marble, from the &s;hells of fi&s;h; and the exten&s;ive pro|vinces of clay, &s;and&s;tone, iron&s;tone, coals, from decompo&s;ed ve|getables; all which have been fir&s;t produced by generation, or by the &s;ecretions of organic life; he concludes, that the world it&s;elf might have been generated, rather than created; that is, it might have been gradually produced from very &s;mall beginnings, increa&s;ing by the ac|tivity of its inherent principles, rather than by a &s;udden evolution of the whole by the Almighty &s;iat.&mdash;What a magnificent idea of the in|finite power of THE GREAT ARCHITECT!

<P N="1">V. 1. The efficient cau&s;e of the various colours of the eggs of birds, and of the hair and feathers of animals, is a &s;ubject &s;o curious, that I &s;hall beg to introduce it in this place. The colours of many animals &s;eem adapted to their purpo&s;es of concealing them&s;elves either to avoid danger, or to &s;pring upon their prey. Thus the &s;nake and wild cat, and leopard, are &s;o coloured as to re&s;emble dark leaves and their lighter inter&s;tices; birds re&s;emble the colour of the brown
<PB N="510" REF="524">
ground, or the green hedges, which they frequent; and moths and butterflies are coloured like the flowers which they rob of their honey. Many in&s;tances are mentioned of this kind in Botanic Garden, p. 2. Note on Rubia.</P>
<P>The&s;e colours have, however, in &s;ome in&s;tances another u&s;e, as the black diverging area from the eyes of the &s;wan; which, as his eyes are placed le&s;s prominent than tho&s;e of other birds, for the con|venience of putting down his head under water, prevents the rays of light from being reflected into his eye, and thus dazzling his &s;ight, both in air and beneath the water; which mu&s;t have happened, if that &s;urface had been white like the re&s;t of his feathers.</P>
<P>There is a &s;till more wonderful thing concerning the&s;e colours adapted to the purpo&s;e of concealment; which is, that the eggs of birds are &s;o coloured as to re&s;emble the colour of the adjacent objects and their inter&s;tices. The eggs of hedge-birds are greeni&s;h with dark &s;pots; tho&s;e of crows and magpies, which are &s;een from beneath through wicker ne&s;ts, are white with dark &s;pots; and tho&s;e of larks and partridges are ru&s;&s;et or brown, like their ne&s;ts or &s;ituations.</P>
<P>A thing &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing is, that many animals in countries covered with &s;now become white in winter, and are &s;aid to change their colour again in the warmer months, as bears, hares, and par|tridges. Our dome&s;ticated animals lo&s;e their natural colours, and break into great variety, as hor&s;es, dogs, pidgeons. The final cau&s;e of the&s;e colours is ea&s;ily under&s;tood, as they &s;erve &s;ome purpo&s;es of the animal, but the efficient cau&s;e would &s;eem almo&s;t beyond con|jecture.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the choroid coat of the eye, on which the &s;emitran&s;parent retina is expanded, is of different colour in different animals; in tho&s;e which feed on gra&s;s it is green; from hence there would appear &s;ome connexion between the colour of the choroid coat and of that con|&s;tantly painted on the retina by the green gra&s;s. Now, when the ground becomes covered with &s;now, it would &s;eem, that that action
<PB N="511" REF="525">
of the retina, which is called whitene&s;s, being con&s;tantly excited in the eye, may be gradually imitated by the extremities of the nerves of touch, or rete muco&s;um of the &s;kin. And if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the action of the retina in producing the perception of any colour con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;o di&s;po&s;ing its own fibres or &s;urface, as to reflect tho&s;e colour|ed rays only, and tran&s;mit the others like &s;oap-bubbles; then that part of the retina, which gives us the perception of &s;now, mu&s;t at that time be white; and that which gives us the perception of gra&s;s, mu&s;t be green.</P>
<P>Then if by the laws of imitation, as explained in Section XII. 33. and XXXIX. 6. the extremities of the nerves of touch in the rete muco&s;um be induced into &s;imilar action, the &s;kin or feathers, or hair, may in like manner &s;o di&s;po&s;e their extreme fibres, as to reflect white; for it is evident, that all the&s;e parts were originally obedient to irrita|tive motions during their growth, and probably continue to be &s;o; that tho&s;e irritative motions are not liable in a healthy &s;tate to be &s;uc|ceeded by &s;en&s;ation; which however is no uncommon thing in their di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, or in their infant &s;tate, as in plica polonica, and in very young pen-feathers, which are &s;till full of blood.</P>
<P>It was &s;hewn in Section XV. on the Production of Ideas, that the moving organ of &s;en&s;e in &s;ome circum&s;tances re&s;embled the object which produced that motion. Hence it may be conceived, that the rete muco&s;um, which is the extremity of the nerves of touch, may by imitating the motions of the retina become coloured. And thus, like the fable of the camelion, all animals may po&s;&s;e&s;s a tendency to be coloured &s;omewhat like the colours they mo&s;t frequently in&s;pect, and finally, that colours may be thus given to the egg-&s;hell by the imagination of the female parent; which &s;hell is previou&s;ly a mucous membrane, indued with irritability, without which it could not cir|culate its fluids, and increa&s;e in its bulk. Nor is this more wonder|ful than that a &s;ingle idea of imagination &s;hould in an in&s;tant colour the whole &s;urface of the body of a bright &s;carlet, as in the blu&s;h of
<PB N="512" REF="526">
&s;hame, though by a very different proce&s;s. In this intricate &s;ubject nothing but loo&s;e analogical conjectures can be had, which may how|ever lead to future di&s;coveries; but certain it is that both the change of the colour of animals to white in the winters of &s;nowy coun|tries, and the &s;pots on birds eggs, mu&s;t have &s;ome efficient cau&s;e; &s;ince the uniformity of their production &s;hews it cannot ari&s;e from a fortuitous concurrence of circum&s;tances; and how is this efficient cau&s;e to be detected, or explained, but from its analogy to other ani|mal facts?</P>
<P N="2">2. The nutriment &s;upplied by the female parent in viviparous ani|mals to their young progeny may be divided into three kinds, corre|&s;ponding with the age of the new creature. 1. The nutriment con|tained in the ovum as previou&s;ly prepared for the embryon in the ovary. 2. The liquor amnii prepared for the fetus in the uterus, and in which it &s;wims; and la&s;tly, the milk prepared in the pectoral glands for the new-born child. There is rea&s;on to conclude that variety of changes may be produced in the new animal from all the&s;e &s;ources of nutriment, but particularly from the fir&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The organs of dige&s;tion and of &s;anguification in adults, and after|wards tho&s;e of &s;ecretion, prepare or &s;eparate the particles proper for nouri&s;hment from other combinations of matter, or recombine them into new kinds of matter, proper to excite into action the filaments, which ab&s;orb or attract them by animal appetency. In this proce&s;s we mu&s;t attend not only to the action of the living filament which receives a nutritive particle to its bo&s;om, but al&s;o to the kind of par|ticle, in re&s;pect to form, or &s;ize, or colour, or hardne&s;s, which is thus previou&s;ly prepared for it by dige&s;tion, &s;anguification, and &s;ecre|tion. Now as the fir&s;t filament of entity cannot be furni&s;hed with the preparative organs above mentioned, the nutritive particles, which are at fir&s;t to be received by it, are prepared by the mother; and de|po&s;ited in the ovum ready for its reception. The&s;e nutritive particles mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to differ in &s;ome re&s;pects, when thus prepared by different animals. They may differ in &s;ize, &s;olidity, colour, and form;
<PB N="513" REF="527">
and yet may be &s;ufficiently congenial to the living filament, to which they are applied, as to excite its activity by their &s;timulus, and its ani|mal appetency to receive them, and to combine them with it&s;elf into organization.</P>
<P>By this fir&s;t nutriment thus prepared for the embryon is not meant the liquor amnii, which is produced afterwards, nor the larger exte|rior parts of the white of the egg; but the fluid prepared, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the ovary of viviparous animals, and that which immediately &s;ur|rounds the cicatricula of an impregnated egg, and is vi&s;ible to the eye in a boiled one.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e ultimate particles of animal matter prepared by the glands of the mother may be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;emble the &s;imilar ultimate particles, which were prepared for her own nouri&s;hment; that is, to the ultimate particles of which her own organization con&s;i&s;ts. And that hence when the&s;e become combined with a new embryon, which in its early &s;tate is not furni&s;hed with &s;tomach, or glands, to alter them; that new embryon will bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to the mother.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the origin of the compound forms of mules, which evidently partake of both parents, but principally of the male parent. In this production of chimeras the antients &s;eem to have indulged their fancies, whence the &s;phinxes, griffins, dragons, centaurs, and minotaurs, which are vani&s;hed from modern cre|dulity.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem, that in the&s;e unnatural conjunctions, when the nutriment depo&s;ited by the female was &s;o ill adapted to &s;timulate the living filament derived from the male into action, and to be received, or embraced by it, and combined with it into organization, as not to produce the organs nece&s;&s;ary to life, as the brain, or heart, or &s;to|mach, that no mule was produced. Where all the parts nece&s;&s;ary to life in the&s;e compound animals were formed &s;ufficiently perfect, ex|cept
<PB N="514" REF="528">
the parts of generation, tho&s;e animals were produced, which are now called mules.</P>
<P>The formation of the organs of &s;exual generation, in contradi&s;tinc|tion to that by lateral buds, in vegetables, and in &s;ome animals, as the polypus, the taenia, and the volvox, &s;eems the chef d'oeuvre, the ma&s;ter-piece of nature; as appears from many flying in&s;ects, as in moths and butterflies, who &s;eem to undergo a general change of their forms &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of &s;exual reproduction, and in all other animals this organ is not complete till the maturity of the creature. Whence it happens that, in the copulation of animals of different &s;pecies, the parts nece&s;&s;ary to life are frequently completely formed; but tho&s;e for the purpo&s;e of generation are defective, as requiring a nicer organization; or more exact coincidence of the particles of nu|triment to the irritabilities or appetencies of the original living fila|ment. Whereas tho&s;e mules, where all the parts could be perfectly formed, may have been produced in early periods of time, and may have added to the numbers of our various &s;pecies of animals, as before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>As this production of mules is a con&s;tant effect from the conjunc|tion of different &s;pecies of animals, tho&s;e between the hor&s;e and the female a&s;s always re&s;embling the hor&s;e more than the a&s;s; and tho&s;e, on the contrary, between the male a&s;s and the mare, always re&s;em|bling the a&s;s more than the mare; it cannot be a&s;cribed to the ima|gination of the male animal which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to operate &s;o uniformly; but to the form of the fir&s;t nutritive particles, and to their peculiar &s;timulus exciting the living filament to &s;elect and com|bine them with it&s;elf. There is a &s;imilar uniformity of effect in re|&s;pect to the colour of the progeny produced between a white man, and a black woman, which, if I am well informed, is always of the mulatto kind, or a mixture of the two; which may perhaps be im|puted to the peculiar form of the particles of nutriment &s;upplied to the embryon by the mother at the early period of its exi&s;tence, and their
<PB N="515" REF="529">
peculiar &s;timulus; as this effect, like that of the mule progeny above treated of, is uniform and con&s;i&s;tent, and cannot therefore be a&s;cribed to the imagination of either of the parents.</P>
<P>When the embryon has produced a placenta, and furni&s;hed it&s;elf with ve&s;&s;els for &s;election of nutritious particles, and for oxygenation of them, no great change in its form or colour is likely to be pro|duced by the particles of &s;u&s;tenance it now takes from the fluid, in which it is immer&s;ed; becau&s;e it has now acquired organs to alter or new combine them. Hence it continues to grow, whether this fluid, in which it &s;wims, be formed by the uterus or by any other cavity of the body, as in extra-uterine ge&s;tation; and which would &s;eem to be produced by the &s;timulus of the fetus on the &s;ides of the cavity, where it is found, as mentioned before. And thirdly, there is &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to expect any unnatural change to happen to the child after its birth from the difference of the milk it now takes; becau&s;e it has acquired a &s;tomach, and lungs, and glands, of &s;ufficient power to decompo&s;e and recombine the milk; and thus to prepare from it the various kinds of nutritious particles, which the appetencies of the va|rious fibrils or nerves may require.</P>
<P>From all this rea&s;oning I would conclude, that though the imagi|nation of the female may be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the embryon by pro|ducing a difference in its early nutriment; yet that no &s;uch power can effect it after it has obtained a placenta, and other organs; which may &s;elect or change the food, which is pre&s;ented to it either in the liquor amnii, or in the milk. Now as the eggs in pullets, like the &s;eeds in vegetables, are produced gradually, long before they are im|pregnated, it does not appear how any &s;udden effect of imagination of the mother at the time of impregnation can produce any con&s;iderable change in the nutriment already thus laid up for the expected or de|&s;ired embryon. And that hence any changes of the embryon, except tho&s;e uniform ones in the production of mules and mulattoes, more probably depend on the imagination of the male parent. At the &s;ame
<PB N="516" REF="530">
time it &s;eems manife&s;t, that tho&s;e mon&s;trous births, which con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome deficiencies only, or &s;ome redundancies of parts, originate from the deficiency or redundance of the fir&s;t nutriment prepared in the ovary, or in the part of the egg immediately &s;urrounding the cicatri|cula, as de&s;cribed above; and which continues &s;ome time to excite the fir&s;t living filament into action, after the &s;imple animal is completed; or cea&s;es to excite it, before the complete form is accompli&s;hed. The former of the&s;e circum&s;tances is evinced by the eggs with double yolks, which frequently happen to our dome&s;ticated poultry, and which, I believe, are &s;o formed before impregnation, but which would be well worth attending to, both before and after impregnation; as it is probable, &s;omething valuable on this &s;ubject might be learnt from them. The latter circum&s;tance, or that of deficiency of original nu|triment, may be deduced from rever&s;e analogy.</P>
<P>There are, however, other kinds of mon&s;trous births, which neither depend on deficiency of parts, nor &s;upernumerary ones; nor are owing to the conjunction of animals of different &s;pecies; but which appear to be new conformations, or new di&s;po&s;itions of parts in re&s;pect to each other, and which, like the variation of colours and forms of our dome&s;ticated animals, and probably the &s;exual parts of all animals, may depend on the imagination of the male parent, which we now come to con&s;ider.</P>

<P N="1">VI. 1. The nice actions of the extremities of our various glands are exhibited in their various productions, which are believed to be made by the gland, and not previou&s;ly to exi&s;t as &s;uch in the blood. Thus the glands, which con&s;titute the liver, make bile; tho&s;e of the &s;tomach make ga&s;tric acid; tho&s;e beneath the jaw, &s;aliva; tho&s;e of the ears, ear-wax; and the like. Every kind of gland mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a peculiar irritability, and probably a &s;en&s;ibility, at the early &s;tate of its exi&s;tence; and mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with a nerve of &s;en&s;e, or of motion, to perceive, and to &s;elect, and to combine the particles, which com|po&s;e the fluid it &s;ecretes.

<P>But in nothing is this nice action of the extremities of the blood|ve&s;&s;els &s;o wonderful, as in the production of contagious matter. A &s;mall drop of variolous contagion diffu&s;ed in the blood, or perhaps only by being in&s;erted beneath the cuticle, after a time, (as about a quar|ter of a lunation,) excites the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin into certain motions, which produce a &s;imilar contagious material, filling with it a thou&s;and pu&s;tules. So that by irritation, or by &s;en&s;ation in con&s;e|quence of irritation, or by a&s;&s;ociation of motions, a material is formed by the extremities of certain cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, exactly &s;imilar to the &s;timulating material, which cau&s;ed the irritation, or con&s;equent &s;en|&s;ation, or a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>Many glands of the body have their motions, and in con&s;equence their &s;ecreted fluids, affected by plea&s;urable or painful ideas, &s;ince they are in many in&s;tances influenced by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations, as well as by the irritations of the particles of the pa&s;&s;ing blood. Thus the idea of meat, excited in the minds of hungry dogs, by their &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion, or of &s;mell, increa&s;es the di&s;charge of &s;aliva, both in quantity and vi&s;|cidity; as is &s;een in its hanging down in threads from their mouths, as they &s;tand round a dinner-table. The &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, or of pain, of peculiar kinds, excite in the &s;ame manner a great di&s;charge of tears; which appear al&s;o to be more &s;aline at the time of their &s;ecre|tion, from their inflaming the eyes and eye-lids. The palene&s;s from fear, and the blu&s;h of &s;hame, and of joy, are other in&s;tances of the effects of painful, or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations, on the extremities of the arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation excited in the &s;tomach by food, as well as its irritation, contributes to excite into action the ga&s;tric glands, and to produce a greater &s;ecretion of their fluids. The &s;ame probably occurs in the &s;ecretion of bile; that is, that the plea&s;ur|able
<PB N="518" REF="532">
&s;en&s;ation excited in the &s;tomach, affects this &s;ecretion by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, as well as by irritative a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly it would &s;eem, that all the glands in the body have their &s;ecreted fluids affected, in quantity and quality, by the plea&s;urable or painful &s;en&s;ations, which produce or accompany tho&s;e &s;ecretions. And that the plea&s;urable &s;entations ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;ecretions may con&s;titute the unnamed plea&s;ure of exi&s;tence, which is contrary to what is meant by taedium vitae, or ennui; and by which we &s;ome|times feel our&s;elves happy, without being able to a&s;cribe it to any mental cau&s;e, as after an agreeable meal, or in the beginning of in|toxication.</P>
<P>Now it would appear, that no &s;ecretion or excretion of fluid is at|tended with &s;o much agreeable &s;en&s;ation, as that of the &s;emen; and it would thence follow, that the glands, which perform this &s;ecretion, are more likely to be much affected by their catenations with plea&s;ur|able &s;en&s;ations. This circum&s;tance is certain, that much more of this fluid is produced in a given time, when the object of its exclu&s;ion is agreeable to the mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. A forceable argument, which &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation to copulation, is, that the act cannot be performed without it; it is ea&s;ily interrupted by the pain of fear or ba&s;hfulne&s;s; and no efforts of volition or of irritation can effect this proce&s;s, except &s;uch as induce plea&s;urable ideas or &s;en&s;ations. See Sect. XXXIII. 1. 1.</P>
<P>A curious analogical circum&s;tance attending hermaphrodite in&s;ects, as &s;nails and worms, &s;till further illu&s;trates this theory; if the &s;nail or worm could have impregnated it&s;elf, there might have been a &s;aving of a large male apparatus; but as this is not &s;o ordered by nature, but each &s;nail and worm reciprocally receives and gives impregnation, it appears, that a plea&s;urable excitation &s;eems al&s;o to have been required.</P>
<P>This wonderful circum&s;tance of many in&s;ects being hermaphro|dites, and at the &s;ame time not having power to impregnate them|&s;elves, is attended to by Dr. Li&s;ter, in his Exercitationes Anatom. de
<PB N="519" REF="533">
Limacibus, p. 145; who, among&s;t many other final cau&s;es, which he adduces to account for it, adds, ut tam tri&s;tibus et frigidis animalibus majori cum voluptate per&s;iciatur venus.</P>
<P>There is, however, another final cau&s;e, to which this circum&s;tance may be imputed: it was ob&s;erved above, that vegetable buds and bulbs, which are produced without a mother, are always exact re|&s;emblances of their parent; as appears in grafting fruit-trees, and in the flower-buds of the dioiceous plants, which are always of the &s;ame &s;ex on the &s;ame tree; hence tho&s;e hermaphrodite in&s;ects, if they could have produced young without a mother, would not have been capable of that change or improvement, which is &s;een in all other animals, and in tho&s;e vegetables, which are procreated by the male embryon received and nouri&s;hed by the female. And it is hence pro|bable, that if vegetables could only have been produced by buds and bulbs, and not by &s;exual generation, that there would not at this time have exi&s;ted one thou&s;andth part of their pre&s;ent number of &s;pecies; which have probably been originally mule-productions; nor could any kind of improvement or change have happened to them, except by the difference of &s;oil or climate.</P>
<P N="3">3. I conclude, that the imagination of the male at the time of co|pulation, or at the time of the &s;ecretion of the &s;emen, may &s;o affect this &s;ecretion by irritative or &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, as de&s;cribed in No. 5. 1. of this &s;ection, as to cau&s;e the production of &s;imilarity of form and of features, with the di&s;tinction of &s;ex; as the motions of the chi&s;|fel of the turner imitate or corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the ideas of the arti&s;t. It is not here to be under&s;tood, that the fir&s;t living fibre, which is to form an animal, is produced with any &s;imilarity of form to the future animal; but with propen&s;ities, or appetencies, which &s;hall produce by accretion of parts the &s;imilarity of form, feature, or &s;ex, corre&s;ponding to the imagination of the father.</P>
<P>Our ideas are movements of the nerves of &s;en&s;e, as of the optic nerve in recollecting vi&s;ible ideas, &s;uppo&s;e of a triangular piece of
<PB N="520" REF="534">
ivory. The fine moving fibres of the retina act in a manner to which I give the name of white; and this action is confined to a de&s;ined part of it; to which figure I give the name of triangle. And it is a pre|ceding plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ting in my mind, which occa&s;ions me to produce this particular motion of the retina, when no triangle is pre&s;ent. Now it is probable, that the acting fibres of the ultimate terminations of the &s;ecreting apertures of the ve&s;&s;els of the te&s;tes, are as fine as tho&s;e of the retina; and that they are liable to be thrown into that peculiar action, which marks the &s;ex of the &s;ecreted em|bryon, by &s;ympathy with the plea&s;urable motions of the nerves of vi&s;ion, or of touch; that is, with certain ideas of imagination. From hence it would appear, that the world has long been mi&s;taken in a&s;cribing great power to the imagination of the female, whereas from this account of it, the real power of imagination, in the act of gene|ration, belongs &s;olely to the male. See Sect. XII. 3. 3.</P>
<P>It may be objected to this theory, that a man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have in his mind, the idea of the form and features of the female, rather than his own, and therefore there &s;hould be a greater number of female births. On the contrary, the general idea of our own form occurs to every one almo&s;t perpetually, and is termed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our exi&s;tence, and thus may effect, that the number of males &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of females. See Sect. XV. 3. 4. and XVIII. 13. And what further confirms this idea is, that the male children mo&s;t frequently re&s;emble the father in form, or feature, as well as in &s;ex; and the fe|male mo&s;t frequently re&s;emble the mother, in feature, and form, as well as in &s;ex.</P>
<P>It may again be objected, if a female child &s;ometimes re&s;embles the father, and a male child the mother, the ideas of the father, at the time of procreation, mu&s;t &s;uddenly change from him&s;elf to the mo|ther, at the very in&s;tant, when the embryon is &s;ecreted or formed. This difficulty cea&s;es when we con&s;ider, that it is as ea&s;y to form an idea of feminine features with male organs of reproduction, or of male
<PB N="521" REF="535">
features with female ones, as the contrary; as we conceive the idea of a &s;phinx or mermaid, as ea&s;ily and as di&s;tinctly as of a woman. Add to this, that at the time of procreation the idea of the male or|gans, and of the female features, are often both excited at the &s;ame time, by contact, or by vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, in my turn, is the &s;ex of the embryon produced by accident? Certainly whatever is produced has a cau&s;e; but when this cau&s;e is too minute for our comprehen&s;ion, the effect is &s;aid in common lan|guage to happen by chance, as in throwing a certain number on dice. Now that cau&s;e can occa&s;ionally produce the male or female charac|ter of the embryon, but the peculiar actions of tho&s;e glands, which form the embryon? And what can influence or govern the&s;e actions of the gland, but its a&s;&s;ociations or catenations with other &s;en&s;itive motions? Nor is this more extraordinary, than that the catenations of irritative motions with the apparent vibrations of objects at &s;ea &s;hould produce &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach; or that a nau&s;eous &s;tory &s;hould occa&s;ion vomiting.</P>
<P N="4">4. An argument, which evinces the effect of imagination on the fir&s;t rudiment of the embryon, may be deduced from the production of &s;ome peculiar mon&s;ters. Such, for in&s;tance, as tho&s;e which have two heads joined to one body, and tho&s;e which have two bodies joined to one head; of which frequent examples occur among&s;t our dome&s;ti|cated quadrupeds, and poultry. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch forms could exi&s;t in primordial germs, as explained in No. IV. 4. of this &s;ection. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch deformities could be pro|duced by the growth of two embryons, or living filaments; which &s;hould afterwards adhere together; as the head and tail part of differ|ent polypi are &s;aid to do (Blumenbach on generation, Cadel, Lon|don); &s;ince in that ca&s;e one embryon, or living &s;ilament, mu&s;t have begun to form one part fir&s;t, and the other another part fir&s;t. But &s;uch mon&s;trous conformations become le&s;s difficult to comprehend, when they are con&s;idered as an effect of the imagination, as before
<PB N="522" REF="536">
explained, on the living filament at the time of its &s;ecretion; and that &s;uch duplicature of limbs were produced by accretion of new parts, in con&s;equence of propen&s;ities, or animal appetencies thus acquired from the male parent.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, I can conceive, if a turkey-cock &s;hould behold a rab|bit, or a frog, at the time of procreation, that it might happen, that a forcible or even a plea&s;urable idea of the form of a quadruped might &s;o occupy his imagination, as to cau&s;e a tendency in the na&s;cent fila|ment to re&s;emble &s;uch a form, by the appo&s;ition of a duplicature of limbs. Experiments on the production of mules and mon&s;ters would be worthy the attention of a Spallanzani, and might throw much light upon this &s;ubject, which at pre&s;ent mu&s;t be explained by con|jectural analogies.</P>
<P>The wonderful effect of imagination, both in the male and female parent, is &s;hewn in the production of a kind of milk in the crops both of the male and female pigeons after the birth of their young, as ob&s;erved by Mr. Hunter, and mentioned before. To this &s;hould be added, that there are &s;ome in&s;tances of men having had milk &s;e|creted in their brea&s;ts, and who have given &s;uck to children, as re|corded by Mr. Buffon. This effect of imagination, of both the male and female parent, &s;eems to have been attended to in very early times; Jacob is &s;aid not only to have placed rods of trees, in part &s;tripped of their bark, &s;o as to appear &s;potted, but al&s;o to have placed &s;potted lambs before the flocks, at the time of their copulation. Gene&s;is, chap. xxx. ver&s;e 40.</P>
<P N="5">5. In re&s;pect to the imagination of the mother, it is difficult to comprehend, how this can produce any alteration in the fetus, ex|cept by a&s;&s;ecting the nutriment laid up for its fir&s;t reception, as de|&s;cribed in No. V. 2. of this &s;ection, or by affecting the nouri&s;hment or oxygenation with which &s;he &s;upplies it afterwards. Perpetual anxiety may probably affect the &s;ecretion of the liquor amnii into the uterus, as it enfeebles the whole &s;y&s;tem; and &s;udden &s;ear is a frequent
<PB N="523" REF="537">
cau&s;e of mi&s;carriage; for fear, contrary to joy, decrea&s;es for a time the action of the extremities of the arterial &s;y&s;tem; hence &s;udden palene&s;s &s;ucceeds, and a &s;hrinking or contraction of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, and other membranes. By this circum&s;tance, I imagine, the terminations of the placental ve&s;&s;els are detached from their adhe&s;ions, or in&s;ertions, into the membrane of the uterus; and the death of the child &s;ucceeds, and con&s;equent mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>Of this I recollect a remarkable in&s;tance, which could be a&s;cribed to no other cau&s;e, and which I &s;hall therefore relate in few words. A healthy young woman, about twenty years of age, had been about five months pregnant, and going down into her cellar to draw &s;ome beer, was frighted by a &s;ervant-boy &s;tarting up from behind the bar|rel, where he had concealed him&s;elf with de&s;ign to alarm the maid|&s;ervant, for whom he mi&s;took his mi&s;tre&s;s. She came with difficulty up &s;tairs, began to flood immediately, and mi&s;carried in a few hours. She has &s;ince borne &s;everal children, nor ever had any tendency to mi&s;carry of any of them.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the power of the imagination of the male over the form, colour, and &s;ex of the progeny, the following in&s;tances have fallen under my ob&s;ervation, and may perhaps be found not very un|frequent, if they were more attended to. I am acquainted with a gentleman, who has one child with dark hair and eyes, though his lady and him&s;elf have light hair and eyes; and their other four children are like their parents. On ob&s;erving this di&s;&s;imilarity of one child to the others he a&s;&s;ured me, that he believed it was his own imagination, that produced the difference; and related to me the following &s;tory. He &s;aid, that when his lady lay in of her third child, he became attached to a daughter of one of his inferior tenants, and offered her a bribe for her favours in vain; and afterwards a greater bribe, and was equally un&s;ucce&s;sful; that the form of this girl dwelt much in his mind for &s;ome weeks, and that the next child, which was the dark-ey'd young
<PB N="524" REF="538">
lady above mentioned, was exceedingly like, in both features and colour, to the young woman who refu&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>To this in&s;tance I mu&s;t add, that I have known two families, in which, on account of an intailed e&s;tate in expectation, a male heir was mo&s;t eagerly de&s;ired by the father; and on the contrary, girls were produced to the &s;eventh in one, and to the ninth in another; and then they had each of them a &s;on. I conclude, that the great de&s;ire of a male heir by the father produced rather a di&s;agreeable than an agreeable &s;en&s;ation; and that his ideas dwelt more on the fear of ge|nerating a female, than on the plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations or ideas of his own male form or organs at the time of copulation, or of the &s;ecretion of the &s;emen; and that hence the idea of the female character was more pre&s;ent to his mind than that of the male one; till at length in de&s;pair of generating a male the&s;e ideas cea&s;ed, and tho&s;e of the male character pre&s;ided at the genial hour.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence I conclude, that the act of generation cannot exi&s;t with|out being accompanied with ideas, and that a man mu&s;t have at that time either a general idea of his own male form, or of the form of his male organs; or an idea of the female form, or of her organs; and that this marks the &s;ex, and the peculiar re&s;emblances of the child to either parent. From whence it would appear, that the phalli, which were hung round the necks of the Roman ladies, or worn in their hair, might have effect in producing a greater proportion of male children; and that the calipaedia, or art of begetting beautiful children, and of procreating either males or females, may be taught by affecting the imagination of the male-parent; that is, by the fine extremities of the &s;eminal glands imitating the actions of the organs of &s;en&s;e either of &s;ight or touch. But the manner of accompli&s;hing this cannot be unfolded with &s;ufficient delicacy for the public eye; but may be worth the attention of tho&s;e, who are &s;eriou&s;ly intere&s;ted in the procreation of a male or female child.</P>

<HEAD>Recapitulation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">VII. 1. A certain quantity of nutritive particles are produced by the female parent before impregnation, which require no further di|ge&s;tion, &s;ecretion, or oxygenation. Such are &s;een in the unimpreg|nated eggs of birds, and in the unimpregnated &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els of vege|tables.</P>
<P N="2">2. A living filament is produced by the male, which being in&s;erted amid&s;t the&s;e fir&s;t nutritive particles, is &s;timulated into action by them; and in con&s;equence of this action, &s;ome of the nutritive particles are embraced, and added to the original living filament; in the &s;ame manner as common nutrition is performed in the adult animal.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then this new organization, or additional part, becomes &s;timu|lated by the nutritive particles in its vicinity, and &s;en&s;ation is now &s;uperadded to irritation; and other particles are in con&s;equence em|braced, and added to the living filament; as is &s;een in the new gra|nulations of fle&s;h in ulcers.</P>
<P>By the power of a&s;&s;ociation, or by irritation, the parts already produced continue their motions, and new ones are added by &s;en&s;a|tion, as above mentioned; and la&s;tly by volition, which la&s;t &s;en&s;orial power is proved to exi&s;t in the fetus in its maturer age, becau&s;e it has evidently periods of activity and of &s;leeping; which la&s;t is another word for a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition.</P>
<P>The original living filament may be conceived to po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of repul&s;ing the particles applied to certain parts of it, as well as of embracing others, which &s;timulate other parts of it; as the&s;e powers exi&s;t in different parts of the mature animal; thus the mouth of every gland embraces the particles of fluid, which &s;uits its appetency; and its excretory duct repul&s;es tho&s;e particles, which are di&s;agreeable to it.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="526" REF="540">
4. Thus the outline or miniature of the new animal is produced gradually, but in no great length of time; becau&s;e the original nu|tritive particles require no previous preparation by dige&s;tion, &s;ecre|tion, and oxygenation: but require &s;imply the &s;election and appo&s;i|tion, which is performed by the living filament. Mr. Blumenbach &s;ays, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a human fetus of only five weeks old, which is the &s;ize of a common bee, and has all the features of the face, every finger, and every toe, complete; and in which the organs of generation are di&s;tinctly &s;een. P. 76. In another fetus, who&s;e head was not larger than a pea, the whole of the ba&s;is of the &s;kull with all its depre&s;&s;ions, apertures, and proce&s;&s;es, were marked in the mo&s;t &s;harp and di&s;tinct manner, though without any o&s;&s;ification. Ib.</P>
<P N="5">5. In &s;ome ca&s;es by the nutriment originally depo&s;ited by the mo|ther the filament acquires parts not exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the fa|ther, as in the production of mules and mulattoes. In other ca&s;es, the deficiency of this original nutriment cau&s;es deficiencies of the ex|treme parts of the fetus, which are la&s;t formed, as the fingers, toes, lips. In other ca&s;es, a duplicature of limbs are cau&s;ed by the &s;uper|abundance of this original nutritive fluid, as in the double yolks of eggs, and the chickens from them with four legs and four wings. But the production of other mon&s;ters, as tho&s;e with two heads, or with parts placed in wrong &s;ituations, &s;eems to ari&s;e from the ima|gination of the father being in &s;ome manner imitated by the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the &s;eminal glands; as the colours of the &s;pots on eggs, and the change of the colour of the hair and feathers of animals by do|me&s;tication, may be cau&s;ed in the &s;ame manner by the imagination of the mother.</P>
<P N="6">6. The living filament is a part of the father, and has therefore certain propen&s;ities, or appetencies, which belong to him; which may have been gradually acquired during a million of generations, even from the infancy of the habitable earth; and which now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch properties, as would render, by the appo&s;ition of nutritious
<PB N="527" REF="541">
particles, the new fetus exactly &s;imilar to the father; as oc|curs in the buds and bulbs of vegetables, and in the polypus, and taenia or tape-worm. But as the fir&s;t nutriment is &s;upplied by the mother, and therefore re&s;embles &s;uch nutritive particles, as have been u&s;ed for her own nutriment or growth, the progeny takes in part the likene&s;s of the mother.</P>
<P>Other &s;imilarity of the excitability, or of the form of the male parent, &s;uch as the broad or narrow &s;houlders, or &s;uch as con&s;titute certain hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, as &s;crophula, epilep&s;y, in&s;anity, have their origin produced in one or perhaps two generations; as in the progeny of tho&s;e who drink much vinous &s;pirits; and tho&s;e heredi|tary propen&s;ities cea&s;e again, as I have ob&s;erved, if one or two &s;ober generations &s;ucceed; otherwi&s;e the family becomes extinct.</P>
<P>This living filament from the father is al&s;o liable to have its pro|pen&s;ities, or appetencies, altered at the time of its production by the imagination of the male parent; the extremities of the &s;eminal glands imitating the motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e; and thus the &s;ex of the embryon is produced; which may be thus made a male or a female by affecting the imagination of the father at the time of impregnation. See Sect. XXXIX. 6. 3. and 7.</P>
<P N="7">7. After the fetus is thus completely formed together with its um|bilical ve&s;&s;els and placenta, it is now &s;upplied with a different kind of food, as appears by the difference of con&s;i&s;tency of the different parts of the white of the egg, and of the liquor amnii, for it has now acquired organs for dige&s;tion or &s;ecretion, and for oxygenation, though they are as yet feeble; which can in &s;ome degree change, as well as &s;elect, the nutritive particles, which are now pre&s;ented to it. But may yet be affected by the deficiency of the quantity of nutri|tion &s;upplied by the mother, or by the degree of oxygenation &s;upplied to its placenta by the maternal blood.</P>
<P>The augmentation of the complete fetus by additional particles of nutriment is not accompli&s;hed by di&s;tention only, but by appo&s;ition
<PB N="528" REF="542">
to every part both external and internal; each of which acquires by animal appetencies the new addition of the particles which it wants. And hence the enlarged parts are kept &s;imilar to their prototypes, and may be &s;aid to be extended; but their exten&s;ion mu&s;t be conceived only as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the enlargement of all their parts by appo&s;ition of new particles.</P>
<P>Hence the new appo&s;ition of parts is not produced by capillary at|traction, becau&s;e the whole is extended; whereas capillary attraction would rather tend to bring the &s;ides of flexible tubes together, and not to di&s;tend them. Nor is it produced by chemical affinities, for then a &s;olution of continuity would &s;ucceed, as when &s;ugar is di&s;|&s;olved in water; but it is produced by an animal proce&s;s, which is the con&s;equence of irritation, or &s;en&s;ation; and which may be termed animal appetency.</P>
<P>This is further evinced from experiments, which have been in&s;ti|tuted to &s;hew, that a living mu&s;cle of an animal body requires greater force to break it, than a &s;imilar mu&s;cle of a dead body. Which evinces, that be&s;ides the attraction of cohe&s;ion, which all matter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and be&s;ides the chemical attractions of affinities, which hold many bodies together, there is an animal adhe&s;ion, which adds vigour to the&s;e common laws of the inanimate world.</P>
<P N="8">8. At the nativity of the child it depo&s;its the placenta or gills, and by expanding its lungs acquires more plentiful oxygenation from the currents of air, which it mu&s;t now continue perpetually to re|&s;pire to the end of its life; as it now quits the liquid element, in which it was produced, and like the tadpole, when it changes into a frog, becomes an aerial animal.</P>

<P N="1">VIII. 1. CAUSE AND EFFECT may be con&s;idered as the pro|gre&s;&s;ion, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motions, of the parts of the great &s;y&s;tem of Nature. The &s;tate of things at this moment is the effect of the &s;tate of things, which exi&s;ted in the preceding moment; and the cau&s;e of the &s;tate of things, which &s;hall exi&s;t in the next moment.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es and effects may be more ea&s;ily comprehended, if mo|tion be con&s;idered as a change of the figure of a group of bodies, as propo&s;ed in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. ina&s;much as our ideas of vi&s;ible or tan|gible objects are more di&s;tinct, than our ab&s;tracted ideas of their mo|tions. Now the change of the configuration of the &s;y&s;tem of nature at this moment mu&s;t be an effect of the preceding configuration, for a change of configuration cannot exi&s;t without a previous configuration; and the proximate cau&s;e of every effect mu&s;t immediately precede that effect. For example, a moving ivory ball could not proceed onwards, unle&s;s it had previou&s;ly began to proceed; or unle&s;s an impul&s;e had been previou&s;ly given it; which previous motion or impul&s;e con&s;titutes a part of the la&s;t &s;ituation of things.</P>
<P>As the effects produced in this moment of time become cau&s;es in the next, we may con&s;ider the progre&s;&s;ive motions of objects as a
<PB N="530" REF="544">
chain of cau&s;es only; who&s;e fir&s;t link proceeded from the great Cre|ator, and which have exi&s;ted from the beginning of the created uni|ver&s;e, and are perpetually proceeding.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e cau&s;es may be conveniently divided into two kinds, ef|ficient and inert cau&s;es, according with the two kinds of entity &s;up|po&s;ed to exi&s;t in the natural world, which may be termed matter and &s;pirit, as propo&s;ed in Sect. I. and further treated of in Sect. XIV. The efficient cau&s;es of motion, or new configuration, con&s;i&s;t either of the principle of general gravitation, which actuates the &s;un and planets; or of the principle of particular gravitation, as in electricity, magneti&s;m, heat; or of the principle of chemical affinity, as in com|bu&s;tion, fermentation, combination; or of the principle of organic life, as in the contraction of vegetable and animal fibres. The inert cau&s;es of motion, or new configuration, con&s;i&s;t of the parts of mat|ter, which are introduced within the &s;pheres of activity of the prin|ciples above de&s;cribed. Thus, when an apple falls on the ground, the principle of gravitation is the efficient cau&s;e, and the matter of the apple the inert cau&s;e. If a bar of iron be approximated to a mag|net, it may be termed the inert cau&s;e of the motion, which brings the&s;e two bodies into contact; while the magnetic principle may be termed the efficient cau&s;e. In the &s;ame manner the fibres, which con&s;titute the retina may be called the inert cau&s;e of the motions of that organ in vi&s;ion, while the &s;en&s;orial power may be termed the ef|ficient cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another more common di&s;tribution of the perpetual chain of cau&s;es and effects, which con&s;titute the motions, or changing con|figurations, of the natural world, is into active and pa&s;&s;ive. Thus, if a ball in motion impinges again&s;t another ball at re&s;t, and commu|nicates its motion to it, the former ball is &s;aid to act, and the latter to be acted upon. In this &s;en&s;e of the words a magnet is &s;aid to at|tract iron; and the prick of a &s;pur to &s;timulate a hor&s;e into exertion; &s;o that in this view of the works of nature all things may be &s;aid ei|ther
<PB N="531" REF="545">
&s;imply to exi&s;t, or to exi&s;t as cau&s;es, or to exi&s;t as effects; that is, to exi&s;t either in an active or pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate.</P>
<P>This di&s;tribution of objects, and their motions, or changes of po|&s;ition, has been found &s;o convenient for the purpo&s;es of common life, that on this foundation re&s;ts the whole con&s;truction or theory of lan|guage. The names of the things them&s;elves are termed by gram|marians Nouns, and their modes of exi&s;tence are termed Verbs. The nouns are divided into &s;ub&s;tantives, which denote the principal things &s;poken of; and into adjectives, which denote &s;ome circum&s;tances, or le&s;s kinds of things, belonging to the former. The verbs are divided into three kinds, &s;uch as denote the exi&s;tence of things &s;imply, as, to be; or their exi&s;tence in an active &s;tate, as, to eat; or their ex|i&s;tence in a pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate, as, to be eaten. Whence it appears, that all languages con&s;i&s;t only of nouns and verbs, with their abbreviations for the greater expedition of communicating our thoughts; as explained in the ingenious work of Mr. Horne Tooke, who has unfolded by a &s;ingle fla&s;h of light the whole theory of lan|guage, which had &s;o long lain buried beneath the learned lumber of the &s;chools. Diver&s;ions of Purley. John&s;on. London.</P>
<P N="4">4. A third divi&s;ion of cau&s;es has been into proximate and remote; the&s;e have been much &s;poken of by the writers on medical &s;ubjects, but without &s;ufficient preci&s;ion. If to proximate and remote cau&s;es we add proximate and remote effects, we &s;hall include four links of the perpetual chain of cau&s;ation; which will be more convenient for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of many philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Thus if a particle of chyle be applied to the mouth of a lacteal ve&s;|&s;el, it may be termed the remote cau&s;e of the motions of the fibres, which compo&s;e the mouth of that lacteal ve&s;&s;el; the &s;en&s;orial power is the proximate cau&s;e; the contraction of the fibres of the mouth of the ve&s;&s;el is the proximate effect; and their embracing the particle of chyle is the remote effect; and the&s;e four links of cau&s;ation con&s;titute ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>Thus when we attend to the ri&s;ing &s;un, fir&s;t the yellow rays of
<PB N="532" REF="546">
light &s;timulate the &s;en&s;orial power re&s;iding in the extremities of the optic nerve, this is the remote cau&s;e. 2. The &s;en&s;orial power is excited into a &s;tate of activity, this is the proximate cau&s;e. 3. The fibrous extremities of the optic nerve are contracted, this is the prox|imate effect. 4. A plea&s;ureable or painful &s;en&s;ation is produced in con&s;equence of the contraction of the&s;e fibres of the optic nerve, this is the remote effect; and the&s;e four links of the chain of cau&s;ation con&s;titute the &s;en&s;itive idea, or what is commonly termed the &s;en&s;a|tion of the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P N="5">5. Other cau&s;es have been announced by medical writers under the names of cau&s;a procatarctica, and cau&s;a proegumina, and cau&s;a &s;ine qu&acirc; non. All which are links more or le&s;s di&s;tant of the chain of re|mote cau&s;es.</P>
<P>To the&s;e mu&s;t be added the final cau&s;e, &s;o called by many authors, which means the motive, for the accompli&s;hment of which the pre|ceding chain of cau&s;es was put into action. The idea of a final cau&s;e, therefore, includes that of a rational mind, which employs means to effect its purpo&s;es; thus the de&s;ire of pre&s;erving him&s;elf from the pain of cold, which he has frequently experienced, induces the &s;avage to con&s;truct his hut; the fixing &s;takes into the ground for walls, branches of trees for rafters, and turf for a cover, are a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vo|luntary exertions; which are &s;o many means to produce a certain ef|fect. This effect of pre&s;erving him&s;elf from cold, is termed the final cau&s;e; the con&s;truction of the hut is the remote effect; the action of the mu&s;cular fibres of the man, is the proximate effect; the volition, or activity of de&s;ire to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from cold, is the proximate cau&s;e; and the pain of cold, which excited that de&s;ire, is the remote cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. This perpetual chain of cau&s;es and effects, who&s;e fir&s;t link is rivetted to the throne of GOD, divides it&s;elf into innumerable diverg|ing branches, which, like the nerves ari&s;ing from the brain, permeate the mo&s;t minute and mo&s;t remote extremities of the &s;y&s;tem, diffu&s;ing
<PB N="533" REF="547">
motion and &s;en&s;ation to the whole. As every cau&s;e is &s;uperior in power to the effect, which it has produced, &s;o our idea of the power of the Almighty Creator becomes more elevated and &s;ublime, as we trace the operations of nature from cau&s;e to cau&s;e, climbing up the links of the&s;e chains of being, till we a&s;cend to the Great Source of all things.</P>
<P>Hence the modern di&s;coveries in chemi&s;try and in geology, by having traced the cau&s;es of the combinations of bodies to remoter ori|gins, as well as tho&s;e in a&s;tronomy, which dignify the pre&s;ent age, contribute to enlarge and amplify our ideas of the power of the Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e. And had tho&s;e ancient philo&s;ophers, who contended that the world was formed from atoms, a&s;cribed their combinations to cer|tain immutable properties received from the hand of the Creator, &s;uch as general gravitation, chemical affinity, or animal appetency, in&s;tead of a&s;cribing them to a blind chance; the doctrine of atoms, as con&s;ti|tuting or compo&s;ing the material world by the variety of their com|binations, &s;o far from leading the mind to athei&s;m, would &s;trengthen the demon&s;tration of the exi&s;tence of a Deity, as the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things; becau&s;e the analogy re&s;ulting from our perpetual experience of cau&s;e and effect would have thus been exemplified through univer&s;al nature.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN any one has long and attentively looked at a bright ob|ject, as at the &s;etting &s;un, on clo&s;ing his eyes, or removing them, an image, which re&s;embles in form the object he was attending to, con|tinues &s;ome time to be vi&s;ible: this appearance in the eye we &s;hall call the ocular &s;pectrum of that object.</P>
<P>The&s;e ocular &s;pectra are of four kinds: 1&s;t, Such as are owing to a le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility of a defined part of the retina; or <HI>&s;pectra from defect of &s;en&s;ibility.</HI> 2d, Such as are owing to a greater &s;en&s;ibility of a defined part of the retina; or <HI>&s;pectra from exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility.</HI> 3d, Such as re&s;emble their object in its colour as well as form; which may be
<PB N="535" REF="549">
termed <HI>direct ocular &s;pectra.</HI> 4th, Such as are of a colour contrary to that of their object; which may be termed <HI>rever&s;e ocular &s;pectra.</HI></P>
<P>The laws of light have been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully explained by the great Newton, and the perception of vi&s;ible objects has been ably in|ve&s;tigated by the ingenious Dr. Berkeley and M. Malebranche; but the&s;e minute phaenomena of vi&s;ion have yet been thought reducible to no theory, though many philo&s;ophers have employed a con&s;iderable degree of attention upon them: among the&s;e are Dr. Jurin, at the end of Dr. Smith's Optics; M. Aepinus, in the Nov. Com. Petropol. V. 10.; M. Beguelin, in the Berlin Memoires, V. II. 1771; M. d'Arcy, in the Hi&s;toire de l'Acad. des Scienc. 1765; M. de la Hire; and, la&s;tly, the celebrated M. de Buffon, in the Memoires de l'Acad. des Scien. who has termed them accidental colours, as if &s;ubjected to no e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, Ac. Par. 1743. M. p. 215.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here apprize the reader, that it is very difficult for different people to give the &s;ame names to various &s;hades of colours; whence, in the following pages, &s;omething mu&s;t be allowed, if on repeating the experiments the colours here mentioned &s;hould not accurately cor|re&s;pond with his own names of them.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>I. Activity of the Retina in Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the &s;ub&s;equent experiments it appears, that the retina is in an active not in a pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate during the exi&s;tence of the&s;e ocular &s;pectra; and it is thence to be concluded, that all vi&s;ion is owing to the activity of this organ.</P>
<P N="1">1. Place a piece of red &s;ilk, about an inch in diameter, as in plate 1, at Sect. III. 1, on a &s;heet of white paper, in a &s;trong light; look &s;teadily upon it from about the di&s;tance of half a yard for a minute; then clo&s;ing your eyelids cover them with your hands, and a green
<PB N="536" REF="550">
&s;pectrum will be &s;een in your eyes, re&s;embling in form the piece of red &s;ilk: after &s;ome time, this &s;pectrum will di&s;appear and &s;hortly re|appear; and this alternately three or four times, if the experiment is well made, till at length it vani&s;hes entirely.</P>
<P N="2">2. Place on a &s;heet of white paper a circular piece of blue &s;ilk, about four inches in diameter, in the &s;un&s;hine; cover the center of this with a circular piece of yellow &s;ilk, about three inches in dia|meter; and the center of the yellow &s;ilk with a circle of pink &s;ilk, about two inches in diameter; and the center of the pink &s;ilk with a circle of green &s;ilk, about one inch in diameter; and the centre of this with a circle of indigo, about half an inch in diameter; make a &s;mall &s;peck with ink in the very center of the whole, as in plate 3, at Sect. III. 3. 6.; look &s;teadily for a minute on this central &s;pot, and then clo&s;ing your eyes, and applying your hand at about an inch di&s;|tance before them, &s;o as to prevent too much or too little light from pa&s;&s;ing through the eyelids, you will &s;ee the mo&s;t beautiful circles of colours that imagination can conceive, which are mo&s;t re&s;embled by the colours occa&s;ioned by pouring a drop or two of oil on a &s;till lake in a bright day; but the&s;e circular iri&s;es of colours are not only different from the colours of the &s;ilks above mentioned, but are at the &s;ame time perpetually changing as long as they exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. When any one in the dark pre&s;&s;es either corner of his eye with his finger, and turns his eye away from his finger, he will &s;ee a circle of colours like tho&s;e in a peacock's tail: and a &s;udden fla&s;h of light is excited in the eye by a &s;troke on it. (Newton's Opt. Q. 16.)</P>
<P N="4">4. When any one turns round rapidly on one foot, till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon the ground, the &s;pectra of the ambient objects continue to pre&s;ent them&s;elves in rotation, or appear to librate, and he &s;eems to behold them for &s;ome time &s;till in motion.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e experiments it appears, that the &s;pectra in the eye are not owing to the mechanical impul&s;e of light impre&s;&s;ed on the retina, nor to its chemical combination with that organ, nor to the
<PB N="537" REF="551">
ab&s;orption and emi&s;&s;ion of light, as is ob&s;erved in many bodies; for in all the&s;e ca&s;es the &s;pectra mu&s;t either remain uniformly, or gra|dually dimini&s;h; and neither their alternate pre&s;ence and evane&s;cence as in the fir&s;t experiment, nor the perpetual changes of their colours as in the &s;econd, nor the fla&s;h of light or colours in the pre&s;&s;ed eye as in the third, nor the rotation or libration of the &s;pectra as in the fourth, could exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not ab&s;urd to conceive, that the retina may be &s;timulated into motion, as well as the red and white mu&s;cles which form our limbs and ve&s;&s;els; &s;ince it con&s;i&s;ts of fibres, like tho&s;e, intermixed with its medullary &s;ub&s;tance. To evince this &s;tructure, the retina of an ox's eye was &s;u&s;pended in a gla&s;s of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; the edges of the&s;e parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> contract, and become &s;mooth like &s;imple mucus, when it is di&s;tended till it breaks; which &s;hews that it con&s;i&s;ts of fibres; and this its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;truction became &s;till more di&s;tinct to the &s;ight, by adding &s;ome cau&s;tic alkali to the water, as the adhering mucus was fir&s;t eroded, and the hair-like fibres remained floating in the ve&s;&s;el. Nor does the degree of tran&s;parency of the retina invalidate the evi|dence of its fibrous &s;tructure, &s;ince Leeuwenhoek has &s;hewn that the cry&s;talline humour it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts of fibres. (Arcana Naturae, V. 1. p. 70.)</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that as the mu&s;cles have larger fibres intermixed with a &s;maller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vi&s;ion has a greater quantity of nervous medulla intermixed with &s;maller fibres; and it is probable that the locomotive mu&s;cles, as well as the va&s;cular ones, of micro&s;copic animals have much greater tenuity than the&s;e of the retina.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides the &s;imilar laws, which will be &s;hewn in this paper to govern alike the actions of the retina and of the mu&s;cles, there are many other analogies which exi&s;t between them. They are both ori|ginally excited into action by irritations, both act nearly in the &s;ame
<PB N="538" REF="552">
quantity of time, are alike &s;trengthened or fatigued by exertion, are alike painful if excited into action when they are in an inflamed &s;tate, are alike liable to paraly&s;is, and to the torpor of old age.</P>

<HEAD>II. OF SPECTRA FROM DEFECT OF SENSIBILITY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The retina is not &s;o ea&s;ily excited into action by le&s;s irritation after having been lately &s;ubjected to greater.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN any one pa&s;&s;es from the bright daylight into a darkened room, the iri&s;es of his eyes expand them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t extent in a few &s;econds of time; but it is very long before the optic nerve, after having been &s;timulated by the greater light of the day, becomes &s;en&s;ible of the le&s;s degree of it in the room; and, if the room is not too ob&s;cure, the iri&s;es will again contract them&s;elves in &s;ome de|gree, as the &s;en&s;ibility of the retina returns.</P>
<P N="2">2. Place about half an inch &s;quare of white paper on a black hat, and looking &s;teadily on the center of it for a minute, remove your eyes to a &s;heet of white paper; and after a &s;econd or two a dark &s;quare will be &s;een on the white paper, which will continue &s;ome time. A &s;imilar dark &s;quare will be &s;een in the clo&s;ed eye, if light be admitted through the eyelids.</P>
<P>So after looking at any luminous object of a &s;mall &s;ize, as at the &s;un, for a &s;hort time, &s;o as not much to fatigue the eyes, this part of the retina becomes le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to &s;maller quantities of light; hence, when the eyes are turned on other le&s;s luminous parts of the &s;ky, a dark &s;pot is &s;een re&s;embling the &s;hape of the &s;un, or other luminous object which we la&s;t beheld. This is the &s;ource of one kind of the dark-coloured <HI>mu&s;cae volitantes.</HI> If this dark &s;pot lies above the center of the eye, we turn our eyes that way, expecting to bring it into
<PB N="539" REF="553">
the center of the eye, that we may view it more di&s;tinctly; and in this ca&s;e the dark &s;pectrum &s;eems to move upwards. If the dark &s;pectrum is found beneath the centre of the eye, we pur&s;ue it from the &s;ame motive, and it &s;eems to move downwards. This has given ri&s;e to various conjectures of &s;omething floating in the aqueous hu|mours of the eyes; but whoever, in attending to the&s;e &s;pots, keeps his eyes unmoved by looking &s;teadily at the corner of a cloud, at the &s;ame time that he ob&s;erves the dark &s;pectra, will be thoroughly con|vinced, that they have no motion but what is given to them by the movement of our eyes in pur&s;uit of them. Sometimes the form of the &s;pectrum, when it has been received from a circular luminous body, will become oblong; and &s;ometimes it will be divided into two circular &s;pectra, which is not owing to our changing the angle made by the two optic axi&s;es, according to the di&s;tance of the clouds or other bodies to which the &s;pectrum is &s;uppo&s;ed to be contiguous, but to other cau&s;es mentioned in No. X. 3. of this &s;ection. The apparent &s;ize of it will al&s;o be variable according to its &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;pectra are more ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable when our eyes are a little weakened by fatigue, it has frequently happened, that people of delicate con&s;titutions have been much alarmed at them, fearing a be|ginning decay of their &s;ight, and have thence fallen into the hands of ignorant oculi&s;ts; but I believe they never are a prelude to any other di&s;ea&s;e of the eye, and that it is from habit alone, and our want of at|tention to them, that we do not &s;ee them on all objects every hour of our lives. But as the nerves of very weak people lo&s;e their &s;en&s;ibility, in the &s;ame manner as their mu&s;cles lo&s;e their activity, by a &s;mall time of exertion, it frequently happens, that &s;ick people in the ex|treme debility of fevers are perpetually employed in picking &s;omething from the bed-clothes, occa&s;ioned by their mi&s;taking the appearance of the&s;e <HI>mu&s;cae volitantes</HI> in their eyes. Benvenuto Celini, an Italian arti&s;t, a man of &s;trong abilities, relates, that having pa&s;&s;ed the whole night on a di&s;tant mountain with &s;ome companions and a conjurer,

and performed many ceremonies to rai&s;e the devil, on their return in the morning to Rome, and looking up when the &s;un began to ri&s;e, they &s;aw numerous devils run on the tops of the hou&s;es, as they pa&s;&s;ed along; &s;o much were the &s;pectra of their weakened eyes magnified by fear, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of fraud or &s;uper&s;tition.

Place a &s;quare inch of white paper on a large piece of &s;traw|coloured &s;ilk; look &s;teadily &s;ome time on the white paper, and then move the center of your eyes on the &s;ilk, and a &s;pectrum of the form of the paper will appear on the &s;ilk, of a deeper yellow than the other part of it: for the central part of the retina, having been &s;ome time expo&s;ed to the &s;timulus of a greater quantity of white light, is become le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to a &s;maller quantity of it, and therefore &s;ees only the yellow rays in that part of the &s;traw-coloured &s;ilk.</P>
<P>Facts &s;imilar to the&s;e are ob&s;ervable in other parts of our &s;y&s;tem: thus, if one hand be made warm, and the other expo&s;ed to the cold, and then both of them immer&s;ed in &s;ubtepid water, the water is per|ceived warm to one hand, and cold to the other; and we are not able to hear weak &s;ounds for &s;ome time after we have been expo&s;ed to loud ones; and we feel a chilline&s;s on coming into an atmo&s;phere of tem|perate warmth, after having been &s;ome time confined in a very warm room: and hence the &s;tomach, and other organs of dige&s;tion, of tho&s;e who have been habituated to the greater &s;timulus of &s;pirituous liquor, are not excited into their due action by the le&s;s &s;timulus of common food alone; of which the immediate con&s;equence is indige&s;tion and hypochondriaci&s;m.</P>

<HEAD>III. OF SPECTRA FROM EXCESS OF SENSIBILITY.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The retina is more ea&s;ily excited into action by greater irritation after having been lately &s;ubjected to le&s;s.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IF the eyes are clo&s;ed, and covered perfectly with a hat, for a minute or two, in a bright day; on removing the hat a red or crim&s;on light is &s;een through the eyelids. In this experiment the retina, after being &s;ome time kept in the dark, becomes &s;o &s;en&s;ible to a &s;mall quan|tity of light, as to perceive di&s;tinctly the greater quantity of red rays than of others which pa&s;s through the eyelids. A &s;imilar coloured light is &s;een to pa&s;s through the edges of the fingers, when the open hand is oppo&s;ed to the flame of a candle.</P>
<P N="2">2. If you look for &s;ome minutes &s;teadily on a window in the be|ginning of the evening twilight, or in a dark day, and then move your eyes a little, &s;o that tho&s;e parts of the retina, on which the dark frame-work of the window was delineated, may now fall on the gla&s;s part of it, many luminous lines, repre&s;enting the frame-work, will appear to lie acro&s;s the gla&s;s panes: for tho&s;e parts of the retina, which were before lea&s;t &s;timulated by the dark frame-work, are now more &s;en&s;ible to light than the other parts of the retina which were expo&s;ed to the more luminous parts of the window.</P>
<P N="3">3. Make with ink on white paper a very black &s;pot, about half an inch in diameter, with a tail about an inch in length, &s;o as to repre|&s;ent a tadpole, as in plate 2, at Sect. III. 8. 3.; look &s;teadily for a minute on this &s;pot, and, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the tadpole will be &s;een on the white part of the paper, which figure of the tadpole will appear whiter or more luminous than the other parts of the white paper; for the part of the retina on which the tad|pole was delineated, is now more &s;en&s;ible to light than the other parts
<PB N="542" REF="556">
of it, which were expo&s;ed to the white paper. This experiment is mentioned by Dr. Irwin, but is not by him a&s;cribed to the true cau&s;e, namely, the greater &s;en&s;ibility of that part of the retina which has been expo&s;ed to the black &s;pot, than of the other parts which had received the white field of paper, which is put beyond a doubt by the next experiment.</P>
<P N="4">4. On clo&s;ing the eyes after viewing the black &s;pot on the white paper, as in the foregoing experiment, a red &s;pot is &s;een of the form of the black &s;pot: for that part of the retina, on which the black &s;pot was delineated, being now more &s;en&s;ible to light than the other parts of it, which were expo&s;ed to the white paper, is capable of per|ceiving the red rays which penetrate the eyelids. If this experiment be made by the light of a tallow candle, the &s;pot will be yellow in|&s;tead of red; for tallow candles abound much with yellow light, which pa&s;&s;es in greater quantity and force through the eyelids than blue light; hence the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;hing blue and green by this kind of candle light. The colour of the &s;pectrum may po&s;&s;ibly vary in the daylight, according to the different colour of the meri|dian or the morning or evening light.</P>
<P>M. Beguelin, in the Berlin Memoires, V. II. 1771, ob&s;erves, that, when he held a book &s;o that the &s;un &s;hone upon his half-clo&s;ed eye|lids, the black letters, which he had long in&s;pected, became red, which mu&s;t have been thus occa&s;ioned. Tho&s;e parts of the retina which had received for &s;ome time the black letters, were &s;o much more &s;en&s;ible than tho&s;e parts which had been oppo&s;ed to the white paper, that to the former the red light, which pa&s;&s;ed through the eyelids, was perceptible. There is a &s;imilar &s;tory told, I think, in M. de Voltaire's Hi&s;torical Works, of a Duke of Tu&s;cany, who was playing at dice with the general of a foreign army, and, believing he &s;aw bloody &s;pots upon the dice, portended dreadful events, and retired in confu&s;ion. The ob&s;erver, after looking for a minute on the black
<PB N="543" REF="557">
&s;pots of a die, and carele&s;sly clo&s;ing his eyes, on a bright day, would &s;ee the image of a die with red &s;pots upon it, as above explained.</P>
<P N="5">5. On emerging from a dark cavern, where we have long conti|nued, the light of a bright day becomes intolerable to the eye for a con&s;iderable time, owing to the exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility exi&s;ting in the eye, after having been long expo&s;ed to little or no &s;timulus. This occa&s;ions us immediately to contract the iris to its &s;malle&s;t aperture, which becomes again gradually dilated, as the retina becomes accu&s;|tomed to the greater &s;timulus of the daylight.</P>
<P>The twinkling of a bright &s;tar, or of a di&s;tant candle in the night, is perhaps owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e. While we continue to look upon the&s;e luminous objects, their central parts gradually appear paler, owing to the decrea&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility of the part of the retina expo&s;ed to their light; whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, by the un&s;teadine&s;s of the eye, the edges of them are perpetually falling on parts of the retina that were ju&s;t before expo&s;ed to the darkne&s;s of the night, and therefore tenfold more &s;en&s;ible to light than the part on which the &s;tar or candle had been for &s;ome time delineated. This pains the eye in a &s;imilar manner as when we come &s;uddenly from a dark room into bright daylight, and gives the appearance of bright &s;cintillations. Hence the &s;tars twinkle mo&s;t when the night is darke&s;t, and do not twinkle through tele&s;copes, as ob&s;erved by Mu&s;&s;chenbroeck; and it will after|wards be &s;een why this twinkling is &s;ometimes of different colours when the object is very bright, as Mr. Melvill ob&s;erved in looking at Sirius. For the opinions of others on this &s;ubject, &s;ee Dr. Prie&s;tley's valuable Hi&s;tory of Light and Colours, p. 494.</P>
<P>Many facts ob&s;ervable in the animal &s;y&s;tem are &s;imilar to the&s;e; as the hot glow occa&s;ioned by the u&s;ual warmth of the air, or our clothes, on coming out of a cold bath; the pain of the fingers on ap|proaching the fire after having handled &s;now; and the inflamed heels from walking in &s;now. Hence tho&s;e who have been expo&s;ed to much cold have died on being brought to a fire, or their limbs have become
<PB N="544" REF="558">
&s;o much inflamed as to mortify. Hence much food or wine given &s;uddenly to tho&s;e who have almo&s;t peri&s;hed by hunger has de&s;troyed them; for all the organs of the fami&s;hed body are now become &s;o much more irritable to the &s;timulus of food and wine, which they have long been deprived of, that inflammation is excited, which ter|minates in gangrene or fever.</P>

<HEAD>IV. OF DIRECT OCULAR SPECTRA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A quantity of &s;timulus &s;omewhat greater than natural excites the retina into &s;pa&s;modic action, which cea&s;es in a few &s;econds.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN duration and energy of the &s;timulus of light and colours excites the perfect action of the retina in vi&s;ion; for very quick mo|tions are imperceptible to us, as well as very &s;low ones, as the whirling of a top, or the &s;hadow on a &s;un-dial. So perfect darkne&s;s does not affect the eye at all; and exce&s;s of light produces pain, not vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. When a fire-coal is whirled round in the dark, a lucid circle remains a con&s;iderable time in the eye; and that with &s;o much vivacity of light, that it is mi&s;taken for a continuance of the irritation of the object. In the &s;ame manner, when a &s;iery meteor &s;hoots acro&s;s the night, it appears to leave a long lucid train behind it, part of which, and perhaps &s;ometimes the whole, is owing to the continuance of the action of the retina after having been thus vividly excited. This is beautifully illu&s;trated by the following experiment: fix a paper &s;ail, three or four inches in diameter, and made like that of a &s;moke jack, in a tube of pa&s;teboard; on looking through the tube at a di&s;tant pro|&s;pect, &s;ome disjointed parts of it will be &s;een through the narrow inter|vals between the &s;ails; but as the fly begins to revolve, the&s;e intervals
<PB N="545" REF="559">
appear larger; and when it revolves quicker, the whole pro&s;pect is &s;een quite as di&s;tinct as if nothing intervened, though le&s;s luminous.</P>
<P N="2">2. Look through a dark tube, about half a yard long, at the area of a yellow circle of half an inch diameter, lying upon a blue area of double that diameter, for half a minute; and on clo&s;ing your eyes the colours of the &s;pectrum will appear &s;imilar to the two areas, as in fig. 3.; but if the eye is kept too long upon them, the colours of the &s;pectrum will be the rever&s;e of tho&s;e upon the paper, that is, the in|ternal circle will become blue, and the external area yellow; hence &s;ome attention is required in making this experiment.</P>
<P N="3">3. Place the bright flame of a &s;permaceti candle before a black ob|ject in the night; look &s;teadily at it for a &s;hort time, till it is ob&s;erved to become &s;omewhat paler; and on clo&s;ing the eyes, and covering them carefully, but not &s;o as to compre&s;s them, the image of the blazing candle will continue di&s;tinctly to be vi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="4">4. Look &s;teadily, for a &s;hort time, at a window in a dark day, as in Exp. 2. Sect. III. and then clo&s;ing your eyes, and covering them with your hands, an exact delineation of the window remains for &s;ome time vi&s;ible in the eye. This experiment requires a little practice to make it &s;ucceed well; &s;ince, if the eyes are fatigued by looking too long on the window, or the day be too bright, the luminous parts of the win|dow will appear dark in the &s;pectrum, and the dark parts of the frame-work will appear luminous, as in Exp. 2. Sect. III. And it is even difficult for many, who fir&s;t try this experiment, to perceive the &s;pectrum at all; for any hurry of mind, or even too great attention to the &s;pectrum it&s;elf, will di&s;appoint them, till they have had a little experience in attending to &s;uch &s;mall &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The &s;pectra de&s;cribed in this &s;ection, termed direct ocular &s;pectra, are produced without much fatigue of the eye; the irritation of the luminous object being &s;oon withdrawn, or its quantity of light being not &s;o great as to produce any degree of unea&s;ine&s;s in the organ of vi&s;ion; which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the next cla&s;s of ocular &s;pectra,
<PB N="546" REF="560">
which are the con&s;equence of fatigue. The&s;e direct &s;pectra are be&s;t ob&s;erved in &s;uch circum&s;tances that no light, but what comes from the object, can fall upon the eye; as in looking through a tube, of half a yard long, and an inch wide, at a yellow paper on the &s;ide of a room, the direct &s;pectrum was ea&s;ily produced on clo&s;ing the eye with|out taking it from the tube: but if the lateral light is admitted through the eyelids, or by throwing the &s;pectrum on white paper, it becomes a rever&s;e &s;pectrum, as will be explained below.</P>
<P>The other &s;en&s;es al&s;o retain for a time the impre&s;&s;ions that have been made upon them, or the actions they have been excited into. So if a hard body is pre&s;&s;ed upon the palm of the hand, as is practi&s;ed in tricks of legerdemain, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h for a few &s;econds whether it remains or is removed; and ta&s;tes continue long to exi&s;t vividly in the mouth, as the &s;moke of tobacco, or the ta&s;te of gentian, after the &s;apid material is withdrawn.</P>

<P N="1">1. ON looking for a time on the &s;etting &s;un, &s;o as not greatly to fatigue the &s;ight, a yellow &s;pectrum is &s;een when the eyes are clo&s;ed and covered, which continues for a time, and then di&s;appears and re|curs repeatedly before it entirely vani&s;hes. This yellow &s;pectrum of the &s;un when the eyelids are opened becomes blue; and if it is made to fall on the green gra&s;s, or on other coloured objects, it varies its own colour by an intermixture of theirs, as will be explained in ano|ther place.</P>

<HEAD>The retina after having been excited into action by a &s;timulus &s;omewhat greater than the la&s;t mentioned falls into oppo&s;ite &s;pa&s;modic action.</HEAD>
<P>THE actions of every part of animal bodies may be advantageou&s;ly compared with each other. This &s;trict analogy contributes much to the inve&s;tigation of truth; while tho&s;e loo&s;er analogies, which com|pare the phenomena of animal life with tho&s;e of chemi&s;try or me|chanics, only &s;erve to mi&s;lead our inquiries.</P>
<P>When any of our larger mu&s;cles have been in long or in violent action, and their antagoni&s;ts have been at the &s;ame time extended, as &s;oon as the action of the former cea&s;es, the limb is &s;tretched the con|trary way for our ea&s;e, and a pandiculation or yawning takes place.</P>
<P>By the following ob&s;ervations it appears, that a &s;imilar circum&s;tance obtains in the organ of vi&s;ion; after it has been fatigued by one kind of action, it &s;pontaneou&s;ly falls into the oppo&s;ite kind.</P>
<P N="1">1.

A &s;pectrum nearly
<PB N="548" REF="562">

</LIST>
<P>That in the&s;e experiments the colours of the &s;pectra are the rever&s;e of the colours which occa&s;ioned them, may be &s;een by examining the third figure in Sir I&s;aac Newton's Optics, L. II. p. 1, where tho&s;e thin laminae of air, which reflected yellow, tran&s;mitted violet; tho&s;e which reflected red, tran&s;mitted a blue-green; and &s;o of the re&s;t, agreeing with the experiments above related.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e rever&s;e &s;pectra are &s;imilar to a colour, formed by a com|bination of all the primary colours except that with which the eye has been fatigued in making the experiment: thus the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of red mu&s;t be &s;uch a green as would be produced by a com|bination of all the other pri&s;matic colours. To evince this fact the following &s;atisfactory experiment was made. The pri&s;matic colours were laid on a circular pa&s;teboard wheel, about four inches in dia|meter, in the proportions de&s;cribed in Dr. Prie&s;tley's Hi&s;tory of Light and Colours, pl. 12. fig. 83. except that the red compartment was entirely left out, and the others proportionably extended &s;o as to com|plete the circle. Then, as the orange is a mixture of red and yellow, and as the violet is a mixture of red and indigo, it became nece&s;&s;ary to put yellow on the wheel in&s;tead of orange, and indigo in&s;tead of violet, that the experiment might more exactly quadrate with the theory it was de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h or confute; becau&s;e in gaining a green &s;pectrum from a red object, the eye is &s;uppo&s;ed to have become in&s;en&s;ible to red light. This wheel, by means of an axis, was made
<PB N="549" REF="563">
to whirl like a top; and on its being put in motion, a green colour was produced, corre&s;ponding with great exactne&s;s to the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of red.</P>
<P N="3">3. In contemplating any one of the&s;e rever&s;e &s;pectra in the clo&s;ed and covered eye, it di&s;appears and re-appears &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till at length it entirely vani&s;hes, like the direct &s;pectra in Sect. V.; but with this additional circum&s;tance, that when the &s;pectrum be|comes faint or evane&s;cent, it is in&s;tantly revived by removing the hand from before the eyelids, &s;o as to admit more light: becau&s;e then not only the fatigued part of the retina is inclined &s;pontaneou&s;ly to fall into motions of a contrary direction, but being &s;till &s;en&s;ible to all other rays of light, except that with which it was lately fatigued, is by the&s;e rays at the &s;ame time &s;timulated into tho&s;e motions which form the rever&s;e &s;pectrum.</P>
<P>From the&s;e experiments there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the fa|tigued part of the retina throws it&s;elf into a contrary mode of action, like o&s;citation or pandiculation, as &s;oon as the &s;timulus which has fa|tigued it is withdrawn; and that it &s;till remains &s;en&s;ible, that is, liable to be excited into action by any other colours at the &s;ame time, ex|cept the colour with which it has been fatigued.</P>

The &s;pectra then both di&s;appeared; and then the internal &s;pectrum was blue; and then, after a &s;econd di&s;appearance, became yellow, and la&s;tly pink, whil&s;t the &s;pectrum of the field va|ried into red and green.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of different coloured &s;pectra were not exactly the &s;ame in the different experiments, though ob&s;erved, as near as could be, with the &s;ame quantity of light, and other &s;imilar circum&s;tances; owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to trying too many experiments at a time; &s;o that the eye was not quite free from the &s;pectra of the colours which were previou&s;ly attended to.</P>

<P>1. AFTER having looked long at the meridian &s;un, in making &s;ome of the preceding experiments, till the di&s;ks faded into a pale blue, I frequently ob&s;erved a bright blue &s;pectrum of the &s;un on other objects all the next and the &s;ucceeding day, which con&s;tantly occurred when I attended to it, and frequently when I did not previou&s;ly attend to it. When I clo&s;ed and covered my eyes, this appeared of a dull yellow; and at other times mixed with the colours of other objects on which it was thrown. It may be imagined, that this part of the retina was become in&s;en&s;ible to white light, and thence a blui&s;h &s;pectrum became vi&s;ible on all luminous objects; but as a yellowi&s;h &s;pectrum was al&s;o &s;een in the clo&s;ed and covered eye, there can remain no doubt of this being the &s;pectrum of the &s;un.

<HEAD>X. MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE were &s;ome circum&s;tances occurred in making the&s;e experi|ments, which were liable to alter the re&s;ults of them, and which I &s;hall here mention for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, who may wi&s;h to re|peat them.</P>

<P N="a"><HI>a.</HI> When an area, about &s;ix inches &s;quare, of bright pink Indian paper, had been viewed on an area, about a foot &s;quare, of white writing paper, the internal &s;pectrum in the clo&s;ed eye was green, being the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the pink paper; and the external &s;pec|trum was pink, being the direct &s;pectrum of the pink paper. The

&s;ame circum&s;tance happened when the internal area was white, and external one pink; that is, the internal &s;pectrum was pink, and the external one green. All the &s;ame appearances occurred when the pink paper was laid on a black hat.</P>
<P N="b"><HI>b.</HI> When &s;ix inches &s;quare of deep violet poli&s;hed paper was viewed on a foot &s;quare of white writing paper, the internal &s;pectrum was yellow, being the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the violet paper, and the external one was violet, being the direct &s;pectrum of the violet paper.</P>
<P N="c"><HI>c.</HI> When &s;ix inches &s;quare of pink paper was viewed on a foot &s;quare of blue paper, the internal &s;pectrum was blue, and the exter|nal &s;pectrum was pink; that is, the internal one was the direct &s;pec|trum of the external object, and the external one was the direct &s;pec|trum of the internal object, in&s;tead of their being each the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the objects they belonged to.</P>
<P N="d"><HI>d.</HI> When &s;ix inches &s;quare of blue paper were viewed on a foot &s;quare of yellow paper, the interior &s;pectrum became a brilliant yel|low, and the exterior one a brilliant blue. The vivacity of the &s;pectra was owing to their being excited both by the &s;timulus of the interior and exterior objects; &s;o that the interior yellow &s;pectrum was both the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the blue paper, and the direct one of the yellow paper; and the exterior blue &s;pectrum was both the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the yellow paper, and the direct one of the blue paper.</P>
<P N="e"><HI>e.</HI> When the internal area was only a &s;quare half-inch of red paper, laid on a &s;quare foot of dark violet paper, the internal &s;pectrum was green, with a reddi&s;h-blue halo. When the red internal paper was two inches &s;quare, the internal &s;pectrum was a deeper green, and the external one redder. When the internal paper was &s;ix inches &s;quare, the &s;pectrum of it became blue, and the &s;pectrum of the external paper was red.</P>
<P N="f"><PB N="554" REF="568">
<HI>f.</HI> When a &s;quare half-inch of blue paper was laid on a &s;ix-inch &s;quare of yellow paper, the &s;pectrum of the central paper in the clo&s;ed eye was yellow, incircled with a blue halo. On looking long on the meridian &s;un, the di&s;k fades into a pale blue &s;urrounded with a whiti&s;h halo.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, though they very much perplexed the ex|periments till they were inve&s;tigated, admit of a &s;atisfactory explana|tion; for while the rays from the bright internal object in exp. <HI>a.</HI> fall with their full force on the center of the retina, and, by fatiguing that part of it, indude the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, many &s;cattered rays, from the &s;ame internal pink paper, fall on the more external parts of the retina, but not in &s;uch quantity as to occa&s;ion much fatigue, and hence induce the direct &s;pectrum of the pink colour in tho&s;e parts of the eye. The &s;ame rever&s;e and direct &s;pectra occur from the violet paper in exp. <HI>b.:</HI> and in exp. <HI>c.</HI> the &s;cattered rays from the central pink paper produce a direct &s;pectrum of this colour on the external parts of the eye, while the &s;cattered rays from the external blue paper produce a direct &s;pectrum of that colour on the central part of the eye, in&s;tead of the&s;e parts of the retina falling reciprocally into their rever&s;e &s;pectra. In exp. <HI>d.</HI> the colours being the rever&s;e of each other, the &s;cattered rays from the exterior object falling on the cen|tral parts of the eye, and there exciting their direct &s;pectrum, at the &s;ame time that the retina was excited into a rever&s;e &s;pectrum by the central object, and this direct and rever&s;e &s;pectrum being of &s;imilar colour, the &s;uperior brilliancy of this &s;pectrum was produced. In exp. <HI>e.</HI> the effect of various quantities of &s;timulus on the retina, from the different re&s;pective &s;izes of the internal and external areas, induced a &s;pectrum of the internal area in the center of the eye, combined of the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of that internal area and the direct one of the ex|ternal area, in various &s;hades of colour, from a pale green to a deep blue, with &s;imilar changes in the &s;pectrum of the external area. For
<PB N="555" REF="569">
the &s;ame rea&s;ons, when an internal bright object was &s;mall, as in exp. <HI>f.</HI> in&s;tead of the whole of the &s;pectrum of the external object being rever&s;e to the colour of the internal object, only a kind of halo, or radiation of colour, &s;imilar to that of the internal object, was &s;pread a little way on the external &s;pectrum. For this internal blue area being &s;o &s;mall, the &s;cattered rays from it extended but a lit|tle way on the image of the external area of yellow paper, and could therefore produce only a blue halo round the yellow &s;pectrum in the center.</P>
<P>If any one &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that the &s;cattered rays from the exterior coloured object do not intermix with the rays from the interior co|loured object, and thus affect the central part of the eye, let him look through an opake tube, about two feet in length, and an inch in di|ameter, at a coloured wall of a room with one eye, and with the other eye naked; and he will find, that by &s;hutting out the lateral light, the area of the wall &s;een through a tube appears as if illumi|nated by the &s;un&s;hine, compared with the other parts of it; from whence ari&s;es the advantage of looking through a dark tube at di&s;tant paintings.</P>
<P>Hence we may &s;afely deduce the following rules to determine be|fore-hand the colours of all &s;pectra. 1. The direct &s;pectrum without any lateral light is an evane&s;cent repre&s;entation of its object in the un|fatigued eye. 2. With &s;ome lateral light it becomes of a colour com|bined of the direct &s;pectrum of the central object, and of the circum|jacent objects, in proportion to their re&s;pective quantity and brilli|ancy. 3. The rever&s;e &s;pectrum without lateral light is a repre&s;enta|tion in the fatigued eye of the form of its objects, with &s;uch a colour as would be produced by all the primary colours, except that of the object. 4. With lateral light the colour is compounded of the re|ver&s;e &s;pectrum of the central object, and the direct &s;pectrum of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to their re&s;pective quantity and brilliancy.</P>

<HEAD>2. Variation and vivacity of the &s;pectra occa&s;ioned by extraneous light.</HEAD>
<P>The rever&s;e &s;pectrum, as has been before explained, is &s;imilar to a colour, formed by a combination of all the primary colours, except that with which the eye has been fatigued in making the experiment: &s;o the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of red is &s;uch a green as would be produced by a combination of all the other pri&s;matic colours. Now it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this rever&s;e &s;pectrum of red is therefore the direct &s;pec|trum of a combination of all the other pri&s;matic colours, except the red; whence, on removing the eye from a piece of red &s;ilk to a &s;heet of white paper, the green &s;pectrum, which is perceived, may either be called the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the red &s;ilk, or the direct &s;pectrum of all the rays from the white paper, except the red; for in truth it is both. Hence we &s;ee the rea&s;on why it is not ea&s;y to gain a direct &s;pectrum of any coloured object in the day-time, where there is much lateral light, except of very bright objects, as of the &s;etting &s;un, or by looking through an opake tube; becau&s;e the lateral external light falling al&s;o on the central part of the retina, contributes to induce the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, which is at the &s;ame time the direct &s;pectrum of that lateral light, deducting only the colour of the central object which we have been viewing. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is difficult to gain the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, where there is no lateral light to contri|bute to its formation. Thus, in looking through an opake tube on a yellow wall, and clo&s;ing my eye, without admitting any lateral light, the &s;pectra were all at fir&s;t yellow; but at length changed into blue. And on looking in the &s;ame manner on red paper, I did at length get a green &s;pectrum; but they were all at fir&s;t red ones: and the &s;ame after looking at a candle in the night.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e &s;pectrum was formed with greater facility when the
<PB N="557" REF="571">
eye was thrown from the object on a &s;heet of white paper, or when light was admitted through the clo&s;ed eyelids; becau&s;e not only the fatigued part of the retina was inclined &s;pontaneou&s;ly to fall into mo|tions of a contrary direction; but being &s;till &s;en&s;ible to all other rays of light except that with which it was lately fatigued, was by the&s;e rays &s;timulated at the &s;ame time into tho&s;e motions which form the rever&s;e &s;pectrum. Hence, when the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of any colour became faint, it was wonderfully revived by admitting more light through the eyelids, by removing the hand from before them: and hence, on covering the clo&s;ed eyelids, the &s;pectrum would often cea&s;e for a time, till the retina became &s;en&s;ible to the &s;timulus of the &s;maller quantity of light, and then it recurred. Nor was the &s;pectrum only changed in vivacity, or in degree, by this admi&s;&s;ion of light through the eye|lids; but it frequently happened, after having viewed bright objects, that the &s;pectrum in the clo&s;ed and covered eye was changed into a third &s;pectrum, when light was admitted through the eyelids: which third &s;pectrum was compo&s;ed of &s;uch colours as could pa&s;s through the eyelids, except tho&s;e of the object. Thus, when an area of half an inch diameter of pink paper was viewed on a &s;heet of white paper in the &s;un&s;hine, the &s;pectrum with clo&s;ed and covered eyes was green; but on removing the hands from before the clo&s;ed eyelids, the &s;pec|trum became yellow, and returned in&s;tantly again to green, as often as the hands were applied to cover the eyelids, or removed from them: for the retina being now in&s;en&s;ible to red light, the yellow rays pa&s;&s;|ing through the eyelids in greater quantity than the other colours, induced a yellow &s;pectrum; whereas if the &s;pectrum was thrown on white paper, with the eyes open, it became only a lighter green.</P>
<P>Though a certain quantity of light facilitates the formation of the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, a greater quantity prevents its formation, as the more powerful &s;timulus excites even the fatigued parts of the eye into action; otherwi&s;e we &s;hould &s;ee the &s;pectrum of the la&s;t viewed object as often as we turn our eyes. Hence the rever&s;e &s;pectra are be&s;t &s;een
<PB N="558" REF="572">
by gradually approaching the hand near the clo&s;ed eyelids to a certain di&s;tance only, which mu&s;t be varied with the brightne&s;s of the day, or the energy of the &s;pectrum. Add to this, that all dark &s;pectra, as black, blue, or green, if light be admitted through the eyelids, after they have been &s;ome time covered, give reddi&s;h &s;pectra, for the rea|&s;ons given in Sect. III. Exp. 1.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances of the extraneous light coinciding with the &s;pontaneous efforts of the fatigued retina to produce a rever&s;e &s;pec|trum, as was ob&s;erved before, it is not ea&s;y to gain a direct &s;pectrum, except of objects brighter than the ambient light; &s;uch as a candle in the night, the &s;etting &s;un, or viewing a bright object through an opake tube; and then the rever&s;e &s;pectrum is in&s;tantaneou&s;ly produced by the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome external light; and is as in&s;tantly converted again to the direct &s;pectrum by the exclu&s;ion of it. Thus, on look|ing at the &s;etting &s;un, on clo&s;ing the eyes, and covering them, a yel|low &s;pectrum is &s;een, which is the direct &s;pectrum of the &s;etting &s;un; but on opening the eyes on the &s;ky, the yellow &s;pectrum is immedi|ately changed into a blue one, which is the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of the yellow &s;un, or the direct &s;pectrum of the blue &s;ky, or a combination of both. And this is again transformed into a yellow one on clo&s;ing the eyes, and &s;o reciprocally, as quick as the motions of the opening and clo&s;ing eyelids. Hence, when Mr. Melvill ob&s;erved the &s;cintilla|tions of the &s;tar Sirius to be &s;ometimes coloured, the&s;e were probably the direct &s;pectrum of the blue &s;ky on the parts of the retina fa|tigued by the white light of the &s;tar. (E&s;&s;ays Phy&s;ical and Literary, p. 81. V. 2.)</P>
<P>When a direct &s;pectrum is thrown on colours darker than it&s;elf, it mixes with them; as the yellow &s;pectrum of the &s;etting &s;un, thrown on the green gra&s;s, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct &s;pectrum is thrown on colours brighter than it&s;elf, it becomes in&s;tant|ly changed into the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, which mixes with tho&s;e brighter colours. So the yellow &s;pectrum of the setting &s;un thrown on the
<PB N="559" REF="573">
luminous &s;ky becomes blue, and changes with the colour or bright|ne&s;s of the clouds on which it appears. But the rever&s;e &s;pectrum mixes with every kind of colour on which it is thrown, whether brighter than it&s;elf or not: thus the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, obtained by viewing a piece of yellow &s;ilk, when thrown on white paper, was a lucid blue green; when thrown on black Turkey leather, becomes a deep violet. And the &s;pectrum of blue &s;ilk, thrown on white paper, was a light yellow; on black &s;ilk was an ob&s;cure orange; and the blue &s;pectrum, obtained from orange-coloured &s;ilk, thrown on yellow, became a green.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the retina is thrown into activity or &s;en&s;ation by the &s;timulus of external colours, at the &s;ame time that it continues the activity or &s;en&s;ation which forms the &s;pectra; in the &s;ame manner as the pri&s;matic colours, painted on a whirling top, are &s;een to mix to|gether. When the&s;e colours of external objects are brighter than the direct &s;pectrum which is thrown upon them, they change it into the rever&s;e &s;pectrum, like the admi&s;&s;ion of external light on a direct &s;pec|trum, as explained above. When they are darker than the direct &s;pec|trum, they mix with it, their weaker &s;timulus being in&s;ufficient to induce the rever&s;e &s;pectrum.</P>

<HEAD>3. Variation of &s;pectra in re&s;pect to number, and figure, and remi&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>When we look long and attentively at any object, the eye cannot always be kept entirely motionle&s;s; hence, on in&s;pecting a circular area of red &s;ilk placed on white paper, a lucid cre&s;cent or edge is &s;een to librate on one &s;ide or other of the red circle: for the exterior parts of the retina &s;ometimes falling on the edge of the central &s;ilk, and &s;ometimes on the white paper, are le&s;s fatigued with red light than the central part of the retina, which is con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to it; and
<PB N="560" REF="574">
therefore, when they fall on the edge of the red &s;ilk, they perceive it more vividly. Afterwards, when the eye becomes fatigued, a green &s;pectrum in the form of a cre&s;cent is &s;een to librate on one &s;ide or other of the central circle, as by the un&s;teadine&s;s of the eye a part of the fatigued retina falls on the white paper; and as by the increa&s;ing fatigue of the eye the central part of the &s;ilk appears paler, the edge on which the unfatigued part of the retina occa&s;ionally falls will appear of a deeper red than the original &s;ilk, becau&s;e it is compared with the pale internal part of it. M. de Buffon in making this experiment ob|&s;erved, that the red edge of the &s;ilk was not only deeper coloured than the original &s;ilk; but, on his retreating a little from it, it became ob|long, and at length divided into two, which mu&s;t have been owing to his ob&s;erving it either before or behind the point of inter&s;ection of the two optic axi&s;es. Thus, if a pen is held up before a di&s;tant candle, when we look inten&s;ely at the pen two candles are &s;een behind it; when we look inten&s;ely at the candle two pens are &s;een. If the &s;ight be un|&s;teady at the time of beholding the &s;un, even though one eye only be u&s;ed, many images of the &s;un will appear, or luminous lines, when the eye is clo&s;ed. And as &s;ome parts of the&s;e will be more vivid than others, and &s;ome parts of them will be produced nearer the center of the eye than others, the&s;e will di&s;appear &s;ooner than the others; and hence the number and &s;hape of the&s;e &s;pectra of the &s;un will continually vary, as long as they exi&s;t. The cau&s;e of &s;ome being more vivid than others, is the un&s;teadine&s;s of the eye of the beholder, &s;o that &s;ome parts of the retina have been longer expo&s;ed to the &s;unbeams. That &s;ome parts of a complicated &s;pectrum fade and return before other parts of it, the following experiment evinces. Draw three concentric cir|cles; the external one an inch and a half in diameter, the middle one an inch, and the internal one half an inch; colour the external and internal areas blue, and the remaining one yellow, as in Fig. 4.; after having looked about a minute on the center of the&s;e circles, in a bright light, the &s;pectrum of the external area appears fir&s;t in the clo&s;ed eye,
<PB N="561" REF="575">
then the middle area, and la&s;tly the central one; and then the central one di&s;appears, and the others in inverted order. If concentric circles of more colours are added, it produces the beautiful ever changing &s;pectrum in Sect. I. Exp. 2.</P>
<P>From hence it would &s;eem, that the center of the eye produces quicker remi&s;&s;ions of &s;pectra, owing perhaps to its greater &s;en&s;ibility; that is, to its more energetic exertions. The&s;e remi&s;&s;ions of &s;pectra bear &s;ome analogy to the tremors of the hands, and palpitations of the heart, of weak people: and perhaps a criterion of the &s;trength of any mu&s;cle or nerve may be taken from the time it can be continued in exertion.</P>

<HEAD>4. Variation of &s;pectra in re&s;pect to brilliancy; the vi&s;ibility of the circu|lation of the blood in the eye.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The meridian or evening light makes a difference in the colours of &s;ome &s;pectra; for as the &s;un de&s;cends, the red rays, which are le&s;s refrangible by the convex atmo&s;phere, abound in great quantity. Whence the &s;pectrum of the light parts of a window at this time, or early in the morning, is red; and becomes blue either a little later or earlier; and white in the meridian day; and is al&s;o variable from the colour of the clouds or &s;ky which are oppo&s;ed to the window.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the&s;e experiments are liable to be confounded, if they are made too &s;oon after each other, as the remaining &s;pectrum will mix with the new ones. This is a very trouble&s;ome circum&s;tance to painters, who are obliged to look long upon the &s;ame colour; and in particular to tho&s;e who&s;e eyes, from natural debility, cannot long continue the &s;ame kind of exertion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, in making the&s;e experiments, the re&s;ult becomes much varied if the eyes, after viewing any object, are removed on other objects for but an in&s;tant of time, before we clo&s;e them to view the &s;pectrum; for the light from
<PB N="562" REF="576">
the object, of which we had only a tran&s;ient view, in the very time of clo&s;ing our eyes acts as a &s;timulus on the fatigued retina; and for a time prevents the de&s;ired &s;pectrum from appearing, or mixes its own &s;pectrum with it. Whence, after the eyelids are clo&s;ed, either a dark field, or &s;ome unexpected colours, are beheld for a few &s;econds, before the de&s;ired &s;pectrum becomes di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="3">3. The length of time taken up in viewing an object, of which we are to ob&s;erve the &s;pectrum, makes a great difference in the appearance of the &s;pectrum, not only in its vivacity, but in its colour; as the direct &s;pectrum of the central object, or of the circumjacent ones, and al&s;o the rever&s;e &s;pectra of both, with their various combinations, as well as the time of their duration in the eye, and of their remi&s;&s;ions or alternations, depend upon the degree of fatigue the retina is &s;ubject|ed to. The Chevalier d'Arcy con&s;tructed a machine by which a coal of fire was whirled round in the dark, and found, that when a lu|minous body made a revolution in eight thirds of time, it pre&s;ented to the eye a complete circle of fire; from whence he concludes, that the impre&s;&s;ion continues on the organ about the &s;eventh part of a &s;econd. (M&eacute;m. de l'Acad. des Sc. 1765.) This, however, is only to be con|&s;idered as the &s;horte&s;t time of the duration of the&s;e direct &s;pectra; &s;ince in the fatigued eye both the direct and rever&s;e &s;pectra, with their in|termi&s;&s;ions, appear to take up many &s;econds of time, and &s;eem very variable in proportion to the circum&s;tances of fatigue or energy.</P>
<P N="4">4. It &s;ometimes happens, if the eyeballs have been rubbed hard with the fingers, that lucid &s;parks are &s;een in quick motion amid&s;t the &s;pectrum we are attending to. This is &s;imilar to the fla&s;hes of fire from a &s;troke on the eye in fighting, and is re&s;embled by the warmth and glow, which appears upon the &s;kin after friction, and is probably owing to an acceleration of the arterial blood into the ve&s;&s;els emptied by the previous pre&s;&s;ure. By being accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve &s;uch &s;mall &s;en&s;ations in the eye, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee the circulation of the blood in this organ. I have attended to this frequently, when I have ob&s;erved
<PB N="563" REF="577">
my eyes more than commonly &s;en&s;ible to other &s;pectra. The circu|lation may be &s;een either in both eyes at a time, or only in one of them; for as a certain quantity of light is nece&s;&s;ary to produce this curious phenomenon, if one hand be brought nearer the clo&s;ed eyelids than the other, the circulation in that eye will for a time di&s;appear. For the ea&s;ier viewing the circulation, it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to rub the eyes with a certain degree of force after they are clo&s;ed, and to hold the breath rather longer than is agreeable, which, by accu|mulating more blood in the eye, facilitates the experiment; but in general it may be &s;een di&s;tinctly after having examined other &s;pectra with your back to the light, till the eyes become weary; then having covered your clo&s;ed eyelids for half a minute, till the &s;pectrum is faded away which you were examining, turn your face to the light, and removing your hands from the eyelids, by and by again &s;hade them a little, and the circulation becomes curiou&s;ly di&s;tinct. The &s;treams of blood are however generally &s;een to unite, which &s;hews it to be the venous circulation, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the greater opacity of the colour of the blood in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; for this venous circulation is al&s;o much more ea&s;ily &s;een by the micro&s;cope in the tail of a tadpole.</P>

<HEAD>5. Variation of &s;pectra in re&s;pect to di&s;tinctne&s;s and &s;ize; with a new way of magnifying objects.</HEAD>
<P>1. It was before ob&s;erved, that when the two colours viewed to|gether were oppo&s;ite to each other, as yellow and blue, red and green, &amp;c. according to the table of reflections and tran&s;mi&s;&s;ions of light in Sir I&s;aac Newton's Optics, B. II. Fig. 3. the &s;pectra of tho&s;e colours were of all others the mo&s;t brilliant, and be&s;t defined; becau&s;e they were combined of the rever&s;e &s;pectrum of one colour, and of the direct &s;pectrum of the other. Hence, in books printed with &s;mall types, or in the minute graduation of thermometers, or of clock-faces, which
<PB N="564" REF="578">
are to be &s;een at a di&s;tance, if the letters or figures are coloured with orange, and the ground with indigo; or the letters with red, and the ground with green; or any other lucid colour is u&s;ed for the letters, the &s;pectrum of which is &s;imilar to the colour of the ground; &s;uch let|ters will be &s;een much more di&s;tinctly, and with le&s;s confu&s;ion, than in black or white: for as the &s;pectrum of the letter is the &s;ame colour with the ground on which they are &s;een, the un&s;teadine&s;s of the eye in long attending to them will not produce coloured lines by the edges of the letters, which is the principal cau&s;e of their confu&s;ion. The beauty of colours lying in vicinity to each other, who&s;e &s;pectra are thus reciprocally &s;imilar to each colour, is owing to this greater ea&s;e that the eye experiences in beholding them di&s;tinctly; and it is pro|bable, in the organ of hearing, a &s;imilar circum&s;tance may con&s;titute the plea&s;ure of melody. Sir I&s;aac Newton ob&s;erves, that gold and indigo were agreeable when viewed together; and thinks there may be &s;ome analogy between the &s;en&s;ations of light and &s;ound. (Optics, Qu. 14.)</P>
<P>In viewing the &s;pectra of bright objects, as of an area of red &s;ilk of half an inch diameter on white paper, it is ea&s;y to magnify it to ten|fold its &s;ize: for if, when the &s;pectrum is formed, you &s;till keep your eye fixed on the &s;ilk area, and remove it a few inches further from you, a green circle is &s;een round the red &s;ilk: for the angle now &s;ub|tended by the &s;ilk is le&s;s than it was when the &s;pectrum was formed, but that of the &s;pectrum continues the &s;ame, and our imagination places them at the &s;ame di&s;tance. Thus when you view a &s;pectrum on a &s;heet of white paper, if you approach the paper to the eye, you may dimini&s;h it to a point; and if the paper is made to recede from the eye, the &s;pectrum will appear magnified in proportion to the di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and agreeably amu&s;ed, with the following experi|ment. I covered a paper about four inches &s;quare with yellow, and with a pen filled with a blue colour wrote upon the middle of it the
<PB N="565" REF="579">
word BANKS in capitals, as in Fig. 5, and &s;itting with my back to the &s;un, fixed my eyes for a minute exactly on the center of the let|ter N in the middle of the word; after clo&s;ing my eyes, and &s;hading them &s;omewhat with my hand, the word was di&s;tinctly &s;een in the &s;pectrum in yellow letters on a blue field; and then, on opening my eyes on a yellowi&s;h wall at twenty feet di&s;tance, the magnified name of BANKS appeared written on the wall in golden characters.</P>

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved by the learned M. Sauvages (No&s;ol. Method. Cl. VIII. Ord. 1.) that the pul&s;ations of the optic artery might be per|ceived by looking attentively on a white wall well illuminated. A kind of net-work, darker than the other parts of the wall, appears and vani&s;hes alternately with every pul&s;ation. This change of the colour of the wall he well a&s;cribes to the compre&s;&s;ion of the retina by the di|a&s;tole of the artery. The various colours produced in the eye by the pre&s;&s;ure of the finger, or by a &s;troke on it, as mentioned by Sir I&s;aac Newton, &s;eem likewi&s;e to originate from the unequal pre&s;&s;ure on va|rious parts of the retina. Now as Sir I&s;aac Newton has &s;hewn, that all the different colours are reflected or tran&s;mitted by the laminae of &s;oap bubbles, or of air, according to their different thickne&s;s or thin|ne&s;s, is it not probable, that the effect of the activity of the retina may be to alter its thickne&s;s or thinne&s;s, &s;o as better to adapt it to reflect or tran&s;mit the colours which &s;timulate it into action? May not mu&s;|cular fibres exi&s;t in the retina for this purpo&s;e, which may be le&s;s mi|nute than the locomotive mu&s;cles of micro&s;copic animals? May not the&s;e mu&s;cular actions of the retina con&s;titute the &s;en&s;ation of light and colours; and the voluntary repetitions of them, when the object
<PB N="566" REF="580">
is withdrawn, con&s;titute our memory of them? And la&s;tly, may not the laws of the &s;en&s;ations of light, here inve&s;tigated, be applicable to all our other &s;en&s;es, and much contribute to elucidate many phenomena of animal bodies both in their healthy and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate; and thus ren|der this inve&s;tigation well worthy the attention of the phy&s;ician, the metaphy&s;ician, and the natural philo&s;opher?</P>

<P>FROM the experiments above mentioned of Galvani, Volta, Fow|ler, and others, it appears, that a plate of zinc and a plate of &s;ilver have greater effect than lead and &s;ilver. If one edge of a plate of &s;ilver about the &s;ize of half a crown-piece be placed upon the tongue, and one edge of a plate of zinc about the &s;ame &s;ize beneath the tongue, and if their oppo&s;ite edges are then brought into contact before the point of the tongue, a ta&s;te is perceived at the moment of their coming into contact; &s;econdly, if one of the above plates be put between the upper lip and the gum of the fore-teeth, and the other be placed under the tongue, and their exterior edges be then brought into contact in a darki&s;h room, a fla&s;h of light is perceived in the eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects I imagine only &s;hew the &s;en&s;ibility of our nerves of &s;en&s;e to very &s;mall quantities of the electric fluid, as it pa&s;&s;es through them; for I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are occa&s;ioned by &s;light electric &s;hocks produced in the following manner. By the experiments pub|li&s;hed by Mr. Bennet, with his ingenious doubler of electricity, which is the greate&s;t di&s;covery made in that &s;cience &s;ince the coated jar, and the education of lightning from the &s;kies, it appears, that zinc was
<PB N="568" REF="582">
always found minus, and &s;ilver was always found plus, when both of them were in their &s;eparate &s;tate. Hence, when they are placed in the manner above de&s;cribed, as &s;oon as their exterior edges come nearly into contact, &s;o near as to have an extremely thin plate of air between them, that plate of air becomes charged in the &s;ame manner as a plate of coated gla&s;s; and is at the &s;ame in&s;tant di&s;charged through the nerves of ta&s;te or of &s;ight, and gives the &s;en&s;ations, as above de&s;cribed, of light or of &s;aporocity; and only &s;hews the great &s;en&s;ibility of the&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e to the &s;timulus of the electric fluid in &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;ing through them.</P>

<P>The&s;e animals &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething like an additional &s;en&s;e by means of their whi&s;kers; which have perhaps &s;ome analogy to the antennae of moths and butterflies. The whi&s;kers of cats con&s;i&s;t not only of the long hairs on their upper lips, but they have al&s;o four or five long hairs &s;tanding up from each eyebrow, and al&s;o two or three on each cheek; all which, when the animal erects them, make with their points &s;o many parts of the periphery of a circle, of an extent at lea&s;t equal to the circumference of any part of their own bodies. With this in&s;trument, I conceive, by a little experience, they can at once determine, whether any aperture among&s;t hedges or &s;hrubs, in which animals of this genus live in their wild &s;tate, is large enough to admit their bodies; which to them is a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, whether pur&s;uing or pur&s;ued. They have likewi&s;e a power of erect|ing and bringing forward the whi&s;kers on their lips; which probably is for the purpo&s;e of feeling, whether a dark hole be further per|meable.</P>

<P>Dr. Thunberg ob&s;erves, in his Journey to the Cape of Good Hope, that there are &s;ome families, which have de&s;cended from blacks in the female line for three generations. The fir&s;t generation proceeding from an European, who married a tawny &s;lave, remains tawny, but approaches to a white complexion; but the children of the third generation, mixed with Europeans, become quite white, and are often remarkably beautiful.

<HEAD>Additional Ob&s;ervations on VERTIGO, which ought to have been in&s;erted in Sect. XX. 6. after the Words "optic nerve," at the End of the &s;econd Paragraph.</HEAD>
<P>After revolving with your eyes open till you become vertiginous, as &s;oon as you cea&s;e to revolve, not only the circum-ambient objects appear to circulate round you in a direction contrary to that, in which you have been turning, but you are liable to roll your eyes forwards and backwards; as is well ob&s;erved, and ingeniou&s;ly demon&s;trated by Dr. Wells in a late publication on vi&s;ion. The &s;ame occurs, if you revolve with your eyes clo&s;ed, and open them immediately at the time of your cea&s;ing to turn; and even during the whole time of re|volving, as may be felt by your hand pre&s;&s;ed lightly on your clo&s;ed
<PB N="570" REF="584">
eyelids. To the&s;e movements of the eyes, of which he &s;uppo&s;es the ob&s;erver to be incon&s;cious, Dr. Wells a&s;cribes the apparent circum|gyration of objects on cea&s;ing to revolve.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of thus turning our eyes forwards, and then back again, after our body is at re&s;t, depends, I imagine, on the &s;ame circum|&s;tance, which induces us to follow the indi&s;tinct &s;pectra, which are formed on one &s;ide of the center of the retina, when we ob&s;erve them apparently on clouds, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XL. 2. 2.; and then not being able to gain a more di&s;tinct vi&s;ion of them, we turn our eyes back, and again and again pur&s;ue the flying &s;hade.</P>
<P>But this rolling of the eyes, after revolving till we become verti|ginous, cannot cau&s;e the apparent circumgyration of objects, in a di|rection contrary to that in which we have been revolving, for the following rea&s;ons. 1. Becau&s;e in pur&s;uing a &s;pectrum in the &s;ky, or on the ground, as above mentioned, we perceive no retrograde mo|tions of objects. 2. Becau&s;e the apparent retrograde motions of ob|jects, when we have revolved till we are vertiginous, continues much longer than the rolling of the eyes above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>3. When we have revolved from right to left, the apparent motion of objects, when we &s;top, is from left to right; and when we have revolved from left to right, the apparent circulation of objects is from right to left; yet in both the&s;e ca&s;es the eyes of the revolver are &s;een equally to roll forwards and backwards.</P>
<P>4. Becau&s;e this rolling of the eyes backwards and forwards takes place during our revolving, as may be perceived by the hand lightly pre&s;&s;ed on the clo&s;ed eyelids, and therefore exi&s;ts before the effect a&s;cribed to it.</P>
<P>And fifthly, I now come to relate an experiment, in which the rolling of the eyes does not take place at all after revolving, and yet the vertigo is more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than in the &s;ituations above mentioned. If any one looks &s;teadily at a &s;pot in the ceiling over his head, or in|deed at his own finger held up high over his head, and in that &s;itu|ation
<PB N="571" REF="585">
turns round till he becomes giddy; and then &s;tops, and looks horizontally; he now finds, that the apparent rotation of objects is from above downwards, or from below upwards; that is, that the apparent circulation of objects is now vertical in&s;tead of horizontal, making part of a circle round the axis of his eye; and this without any rolling of his eyeballs. The rea&s;on of there being no rolling of the eyeballs perceived after this experiment, is, becau&s;e the images of objects are formed in rotation round the axis of the eye, and not from one &s;ide to the other of the axis of it; &s;o that, as the eyeball has not power to turn in its &s;ocket round its own axis, it cannot follow the apparent motions of the&s;e evane&s;cent &s;pectra, either before or after the body is at re&s;t. From all which arguments it is manife&s;t, that the&s;e apparent retrograde gyrations of objects are not cau&s;ed by the rolling of the eyeballs; fir&s;t, becau&s;e no apparent retrogre&s;&s;ion of ob|jects is ob&s;erved in other rollings of the eyes: &s;econdly, becau&s;e the apparent retrogre&s;&s;ion of objects continues many &s;econds after the rolling of the eyeballs cea&s;es. Thirdly, becau&s;e the apparent retro|gre&s;&s;ion of objects is &s;ometimes one way, and &s;ometimes another, yet the rolling of the eyeballs is the &s;ame. Fourthly, becau&s;e the rolling of the eyeballs exi&s;ts before the apparent retrograde motions of objects is ob&s;erved; that is, before the revolving per&s;on &s;tops. And fifthly, becau&s;e the apparent retrograde gyration of objects is produced, when there is no rolling of the eyeballs at all.</P>
<P>Doctor Wells imagines, that no &s;pectra can be gained in the eye, if a per&s;on revolves with his eyelids clo&s;ed, and thinks this a &s;ufficient argument again&s;t the opinion, that the apparent progre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pectra of light or colours in the eye can cau&s;e the apparent retro|gre&s;&s;ion of objects in the vertigo above de&s;cribed; but it is certain, when any per&s;on revolves in a light room with his eyes clo&s;ed, that he neverthele&s;s perceives differences of light both in quantity and co|lour through his eyelids, as he turns round; and readily gains &s;pectra of tho&s;e differences. And the&s;e &s;pectra are not very different except
<PB N="572" REF="586">
in vivacity from tho&s;e, which he acquires, when he revolves with unclo&s;ed eyes, &s;ince if he then revolves very rapidly the colours and forms of &s;urrounding objects are as it were mixed together in his eye; as when the pri&s;matic colours are painted on a wheel, they appear white as they revolve. The truth of this is evinced by the &s;taggering or vertigo of men perfectly blind, when they turn round; which is not attended with apparent circulation of objects, but is a vertiginous di&s;order of the &s;en&s;e of touch. Blind men balance them&s;elves by their &s;en&s;e of touch; which, being le&s;s adapted for perceiving &s;mall devi|ations from their perpendicular, occa&s;ions them to carry them&s;elves more erect in walking. This method of balancing them&s;elves by the direction of their pre&s;&s;ure again&s;t the floor, becomes di&s;ordered by the unu&s;ual mode of action in turning round, and they begin to lo&s;e their perpendicularity, that is, they become vertiginous; but without any apparent circular motions of vi&s;ible objects.</P>
<P>It will appear from the following experiments, that the apparent progre&s;&s;ion of the ocular &s;pectra of light or colours is the cau&s;e of the apparent retrogre&s;&s;ion of objects, after a per&s;on has revolved, till he is vertiginous.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when a per&s;on turns round in a light room with his eyes open, but clo&s;es them before he &s;tops, he will &s;eem to be carried for|wards in the direction he was turning for a &s;hort time after he &s;tops. But if he opens his eyes again, the objects before him in&s;tantly appear to move in a retrograde direction, and he lo&s;es the &s;en&s;ation of being carried forwards. The &s;ame occurs if a per&s;on revolves in a light room with his eyes clo&s;ed; when he &s;tops, he &s;eems to be for a time car|ried forwards, if his eyes are &s;till clo&s;ed; but the in&s;tant he opens them, the &s;urrounding objects appear to move in retrograde gyration. From hence it may be concluded, that it is the &s;en&s;ation or imagina|tion of our continuing to go forwards in the direction in which we were turning, that cau&s;es the apparent retrograde circulation of ob|jects.</P>
<P><PB N="573" REF="587">
Secondly, though there is an audible vertigo, as is known by the batt&egrave;ment, or undulations of &s;ound in the ears, which many verti|ginous people experience; and though there is al&s;o a tangible vertigo, as when a blind per&s;on turns round, as mentioned above; yet as this circumgyration of objects is an hallucination or deception of the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, we are to look for the cau&s;e of our appearing to move for|ward, when we &s;top with our eyes clo&s;ed after gyration, to &s;ome af|fection of this &s;en&s;e. Now, thirdly, if the &s;pectra formed in the eye during our rotation, continue to change, when we &s;tand &s;till, like the &s;pectra de&s;cribed in Sect. III. 3. 6. &s;uch changes mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to us the idea or &s;en&s;ation of our &s;till continuing to turn round; as is the ca&s;e, when we revolve in a light room, and clo&s;e our eyes before we &s;top. And la&s;tly, on opening our eyes in the &s;ituation above de|&s;cribed, the objects we chance to view amid the&s;e changing &s;pectra in the eye, mu&s;t &s;eem to move in a contrary direction; as the moon &s;ometimes appears to move retrograde, when &s;wift-gliding clouds are pa&s;&s;ing forwards &s;o much nearer the eye of the beholder.</P>
<P>To make ob&s;ervations on faint ocular &s;pectra requires &s;ome degree of habit, and compo&s;ure of mind, and even patience; &s;ome of tho&s;e de&s;cribed in Sect. XL. were found difficult to &s;ee, by many, who tried them; now it happens, that the mind, during the confu&s;ion of vertigo, when all the other irritative tribes of motion, as well as tho&s;e of vi&s;ion, are in &s;ome degree di&s;turbed, together with the fear of fall|ing, is in a very unfit &s;tate for the contemplation of &s;uch weak &s;en&s;a|tions, as are occa&s;ioned by faint ocular &s;pectra. Yet after frequently revolving, both with my eyes clo&s;ed, and with them open, and at|tending to the &s;pectra remaining in them, by &s;hading the light from my eyelids more or le&s;s with my hand, I at length cea&s;ed to have the idea of going forward, after I &s;topped with my eyes clo&s;ed; and &s;aw changing &s;pectra in my eyes, which &s;eemed to move, as it were, over the fiold of vi&s;ion; till at length, by repeated trials on &s;unny days, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, on opening my eyes, after revolving &s;ome
<PB N="574" REF="588">
time, on a &s;helf of gilded books in my library, that I could perceive the &s;pectra in my eyes move forwards over one or two of the books, like the vapours in the air of a &s;ummer's day; and could &s;o far unde|ceive my&s;elf, as to perceive the books to &s;tand &s;till. After more trials I &s;ometimes brought my&s;elf to believe, that I &s;aw changing &s;pectra of lights and &s;hades moving in my eyes, after turning round for &s;ome time, but did not imagine either the &s;pectra or the objects to be in a &s;tate of gyration. I &s;peak, however, with diffidence of the&s;e facts, as I could not always make the experiments &s;ucceed, when there was not a &s;trong light in my room, or when my eyes were not in the mo&s;t proper &s;tate for &s;uch ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The ingenious and learned M. Savage has mentioned other theories to account for the apparent circumgyration of objects in vertiginous people. As the retrograde motions of the particles of blood in the op|tic arteries, by &s;pa&s;m, or by fear, as is &s;een in the tails of tadpoles, and membranes between the fingers of frogs. Another cau&s;e he thinks may be from the librations to one &s;ide, and to the other, of the cry&s;|talline lens in the eye, by means of involuntary actions of the mu&s;cles, which con&s;titute the ciliary proce&s;s. Both the&s;e theories lie under the &s;ame objection as that of Dr. Wells before mentioned; namely, that the apparent motions of objects, after the ob&s;erver has revolved for &s;ome time, &s;hould appear to vibrate this way and that; and not to circulate uniformly in a direction contrary to that, in which the ob&s;erver had revolved.</P>
<P>M. Savage has, la&s;tly, mentioned the theory of colours left in the eye, which he has termed impre&s;&s;ions on the retina. He &s;ays, "Ex|perience teaches us, that impre&s;&s;ions made on the retina by a vi&s;ible object remain &s;ome &s;econds after the object is removed; as appears from the circle of fire which we &s;ee, when a fire-&s;tick is whirled round in the dark; therefore when we are carried round our own axis in a circle, we undergo a temporary vertigo, when we &s;top; becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ions of the circumjacent objects remain for a time after|wards
<PB N="575" REF="589">
on the retina." No&s;olog. Method. Cla&s;. VIII. 1. 1. We have before ob&s;erved, that the changes of the&s;e colours remaining in the eye, evinces them to be motions of the fine terminations of the retina, and not impre&s;&s;ions on it; as impre&s;&s;ions on a pa&s;&s;ive &s;ub&s;tance mu&s;t either remain, or cea&s;e intirely.</P>
