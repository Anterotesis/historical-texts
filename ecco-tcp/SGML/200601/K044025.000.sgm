<P>_AS &s;oon as I had re&s;olved to addre&s;s the follow|ing Treati&s;e to one of the Gentlemen who was abu&s;ed, together with my&s;elf, in the late infamous Libel, more than one Motive induced me to
<PB REF="3">
make Choice of You: For as no one was &s;o flagrantly in|jur'd as Your&s;elf, the infa|mous A&s;per&s;ion was &s;o open and &s;o manife&s;t, that there remained not the lea&s;t Doubt who was the Per&s;on meant by it. An In&s;inuation equally ba&s;e and groundle&s;s, which could have enter'd into the Head of no one who had either Sen&s;e, Honour, or Na|ture in him; into the Head of no one, but one who&s;e Mind was equally out of Na|ture, and equally crooked and deformed with his Body. This ba&s;e In&s;inuation was not only contrary to Truth and Ju&s;tice, but even contrary to common Fame; for You are known
<PB REF="4">
to have that Re&s;pect, E&s;teem, and Affection for the mo&s;t beautiful Part of the Creation, which God and Nature de|&s;ign'd we &s;hould have: But You have Qualities to re|commend You to them, which have not been given to all, as Truth, Faith, Honour, Ju&s;tice, and a Conver&s;ation, at the &s;ame time, entertaining, and in&s;tructing: The&s;e are Quali|ties which have recommended You to a very fine Lady, to whom You have been married many Years, and by whom You have had Eight Chil|dren, who are now living: And the&s;e are Qualities, which, as they have gain'd You the Affections of the Fair Sex,
<PB REF="5">
have equally recommended You to the E&s;teem and Re|&s;pect of Ours; and more par|ticularly of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was towards the latter End of the Reign of Queen ANNE that I wrote Remarks upon the fir&s;t hundred Lines of the late Tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Homer,</HI> upon the <HI>Wind&s;or Fore&s;t,</HI> upon the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> and upon the infamous <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> provok'd and urg'd to it by the Folly, the Pride, and the Petulancy of that little Gentleman <HI>A. P-E</HI>; Qualities which at that Time made me fore&s;ee and foretell, that there was no Per&s;on what|ever whom he apprehended to be above him, whether by Station, Power, or Merit, but he would come impudently one Day to fly in his Face, if timely Care were not taken to cha&s;ti&s;e and correct his &s;oaring In&s;olence.</P>
<P>It was in the Beginning of the Reign of the late KING that I order'd three of the fore|mention'd Treati&s;es to be publi&s;h'd, <HI>viz. Remarks</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
on the <HI>Tran&s;lation of Homer,</HI> on <HI>Wind|&s;or Fore&s;t,</HI> and on the <HI>Temple of Fame</HI>; which was done with a De&s;ign to hold a faithful Gla&s;s to this little Gentleman, and to cure him of his vain and his wretched Conceited|ne&s;s, by giving him a View of his Ignorance, his Folly, and his natural Impotence, the un|doubled Cau&s;es of &s;o many Errors and &s;o ma|ny Imperfections.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame Time that I order'd three of them to be publi&s;h'd, I took care to keep back the en&s;uing Treati&s;e purpo&s;ely <HI>in Terro|rem</HI>; which had &s;o good an Effect, that he endeavour'd for a time to counterfeit Humility and a &s;incere Repentance: And about that Time I receiv'd a Letter from him, which I have &s;till by me, in which he acknowledg'd his Offences pa&s;t, and expre&s;s'd an hypocritical Sorrow for them.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner did he believe that Time had caus'd the&s;e Things to be forgot, than he re|laps'd into ten times the Folly and the Mad|ne&s;s that ever he had &s;hewn before. He not only attack'd &s;everal Per&s;ons of far greater Me|rit than him&s;elf, but, like a mad <HI>Indian</HI> that runs a muck, &s;truck at every Thing that came in his Way, without Di&s;tinction of Friend or Foe, Acquaintance or Stranger, Merit or Un|worthine&s;s, Wi&s;dom or Folly, Vice or Virtue; like a blind Beetle, that in its blundering Flight brui&s;es it&s;elf again&s;t every Object it meets, and
<PB N="v" REF="8">
does not fail to knock it&s;elf down by the im|potent Blows which it gives to others.</P>
<P>He has not only &s;truck at very different Per&s;ons, without any manner of Di&s;tinction, but has thrown his rhetorical Flowers, of Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoundrel, promi&s;cuou&s;ly at them all; as if he wi&s;ely thought, that he was the only foul-mouth'd Fellow in <HI>England,</HI> or had &s;o much of the Fool, Blockhead, Dunce, Scoundrel within him, that they have the &s;ame Effect on his Mind that Jaundice would have upon his Eyes, and make every Thing without him be to him in Appearance, what in Reality is within him.</P>
<P>Nothing is more ea&s;y than to give foul Lan|guage, which a Fool is more capable of giving to a wi&s;e Man, than a wi&s;e Man to a Fool; becau&s;e nothing incapacitates a Man &s;o much for it as good Sen&s;e, good Nature, good Breed|ing, and common Di&s;cretion; and nothing qualifies a Man more for it, than his being a Clown, a Fool, a Barbarian, and a Brute. The calling a Man Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, Scoun|drel, if it does not find him &s;o, it does by no means make him &s;o. But if it does not find him &s;o, it gives him who calls him &s;o, an un|que&s;tionable Title to tho&s;e Terms him&s;elf. As this is the Language of the Rabble of Mankind, the more any one brings him&s;elf to u&s;e it, the more he &s;ets him&s;elf upon an infamous Le|vel with the Scum and Off-&s;couring of Things.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="9">
Before I take my leave of this Subject, I cannot help reminding this little Gentlemen, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> that tho' his Adver&s;aries were as many Fools, Blockheads, Dunces, as he is pleas'd, in Hononr to them, to call them; yet is he mo&s;t unju&s;t, and mo&s;t ungrateful, to reflect upon any Per&s;ons for their Want of Capacity: &s;ince 'tis to People who want Under&s;tanding that he owes mo&s;t of his little Fortune and all his little Reputation. For I will venture to affirm, that Mr. <HI>A. P-E</HI> has no Admirers among tho&s;e who have Capacity to di&s;cern, to di&s;tingui&s;h, and judge; and I will venture to foretell, that Time will make this Affirmation good.</P>
<P>Not but that I am oblig'd in Ju&s;tice to own, that there are &s;everal Per&s;ons of very great Merit who &s;ub&s;crib'd to his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Ho|mer</HI>; but then they were Per&s;ons mo&s;t of them who were induc'd to expect a very different Performance to what they found: And &s;ome were importun'd and teaz'd into that Sub&s;crip|tion, &s;ome were drawn in by their Complai|&s;ance to their Friends, and others &s;acrific'd their Judgment to their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The calling a Man of the be&s;t Under&s;tand|ing Fool, Dunce, Blockhead, is the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World (as we ob&s;erv'd above) to him who is really all this him&s;elf: But for &s;uch a one to prove what he &s;ays, is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. Therefore in the Remarks above|mention'd, upon the Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
upon <HI>Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t,</HI> upon the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> I have given none of the&s;e Appellations to the little facetious Gentleman at whom tho&s;e Pieces were levelled; but then I have prov'd in them, by convincing Rea&s;on and by undeniable Fact, that he has a greater Right to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Property of them than any other Per&s;on in <HI>Great Britain</HI> whatever. I have &s;hewn that he was equally a Stranger to the Character, the Language, and the Meaning of <HI>Homer</HI>; that nothing qualify'd him to en|ter the Li&s;ts again&s;t Sir <HI>John Denham,</HI> but Im|pudence and Stupidity; and that the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> will, as long as 'tis remember'd, be to <HI>A. P-E</HI> the <HI>Temple of Infamy.</HI></P>
<P>I propo&s;e to do the &s;ame Thing in the &s;ub|&s;equent Remarks. I &s;hall call him neither Fool, nor Dunce, nor Blockhead; but I &s;hall prove that he is all the&s;e in a mo&s;t egregious man|ner. 'Tis ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd by the Duke of <HI>Roch|foucault,</HI> <Q>That a Man may be a very great Fool notwith&s;tanding his <HI>Wit</HI>; but that he never can be &s;o if he has <HI>Judgment</HI>: For <HI>Imagination</HI> is common to Man with Bea&s;ts, but he enjoys <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> in com|mon with God and Angels.</Q> The impartial Reader, who knows the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> and who will read the following <HI>Remarks,</HI> will be able to determine whether <HI>A. P-E</HI> has &s;hewn one Dram of Judgment, either in the Choice of this trifling <HI>Subject,</HI> or of his more &s;en&s;ele&s;s <HI>Machinery,</HI> or in the <HI>Manners</HI> and
<PB N="viii" REF="11">
<HI>Behaviour</HI> of his fine Lady, who is &s;o very rampant, and &s;o very a Termagant, that a La|dy in the Hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI> would be &s;e|verely cha&s;tis'd, if &s;he had the Impudence in &s;ome Company to imitate her in &s;ome of her Actions. The impartial Reader is to determine whether the <HI>Sentiments</HI> are not often exceeding poor, and mean, and &s;ometimes ridiculous; and whe|ther the <HI>Diction</HI> is not often impure and un|grammatical.</P>
<P>But if the Author has not &s;hewn one Dram of Judgment in the Piece that has been &s;o much applauded by Readers more light than the Subject, what &s;hall we &s;ay of the in&s;ipid <HI>Profund?</HI> What &s;hall we &s;ay of the ful&s;ome <HI>Dunciad?</HI> Were they not writ in perfect Spight to good Sen&s;e, to Decency, to Ju&s;tice, to Gratitude, to Friend&s;hip, to Mode&s;ty? And can &s;uch a Creature as this be de&s;erving of the noble Name of a POET, the Name and the Function which he has &s;o much bla&s;phem'd? Nay, can he de&s;erve even the Name of a Ver&s;ifyer, who&s;e Ear is as injudicious and un|di&s;tingui&s;hing as the re&s;t of his Head? The Commendation which <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> &s;o ju&s;tly and &s;o judiciou&s;ly gives to <HI>Lucretius,</HI> is, <HI>Nobili&s;&s;imo Ver&s;ificatore,</HI> a <HI>mo&s;t noble Ver&s;ifyer:</HI> For <HI>Lu|cretius</HI> knew all the Variety, the Force, and the Power of Numbers; &s;o that his Harmony in &s;ome Parts of him has never been &s;urpa&s;s'd, not even by <HI>Virgil</HI> him&s;elf. But <HI>A. P-E</HI> has none of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Talents, nor
<PB N="ix" REF="12">
Variety, nor Force, nor Power of Numbers, but an eternal Monotony. His <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> is no|thing but a batter'd <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Jade, that neither ambles, nor paces, nor trots, nor runs, but is always upon the <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and as he ne|ver mends, never &s;lackens his Pace, but when he &s;tumbles or falls. So that having neither Judgment nor Numbers, he is neither Poet nor Ver&s;ifyer, but only an eternal Rhimer, a little conceited incorrigible Creature, that like the Frog in the Fable, &s;wells and is angry be|cau&s;e he is not allow'd to be as great as the Ox.</P>
<P>But if Judgment, Rea&s;on, and Numbers are wanting to his Rhimes, if we take a View of his pro&s;aick Rhap&s;odies, 'tis there a thou|&s;and times wor&s;e: Not only Judgment and Rea&s;on are wanting there; but Veracity, Inte|grity, Honour, and Faith are wanting. <HI>A. P-E</HI> &s;ets up for a Knight of the Po&s;t, a frank Affi|davit-Man of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> fal&s;ifies Matter of Fact at Plea&s;ure, and invents the ba&s;e&s;t Calumnies, to expo&s;e Men of Sen&s;e to Fools. In the Height of his Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip for Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> he could not bear the Succe&s;s of <HI>Cato,</HI> but prevails upon <HI>B. L.</HI> to engage me to write and publi&s;h Remarks upon that Trage|dy: Which after I had done, <HI>A. P-E,</HI> the better to conceal him&s;elf from Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and his Friends, writes and publi&s;hes a &s;canda|lous Pamphlet, equally fooli&s;h and villainous, in which he pretends that I was in the Hands
<PB N="x" REF="13">
of a Quack who cures mad Men. So weak is the Capacity of this little Gentleman, that he did not know that he had done an odious Thing; an Action dete&s;ted even by tho&s;e whom he fondly de&s;ign'd to oblige by it. For Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was &s;o far from approving of it, that he engag'd Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> to write to me, and to a&s;&s;ure me that he knew nothing of that Pamphlet till he &s;aw it in Print, that he was very &s;orry to &s;ee it, and that whenever he &s;hould think fit to an&s;wer my Remarks on his Tragedy, he would do it in a manner to which I &s;hould have no ju&s;t Exception. Thus Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> acted like a Man of Honour, and like one who fore&s;aw what he him&s;elf had to expect from a Wretch who was capable of &s;o much Ba&s;ene&s;s. What he fore&s;aw and expected happen'd: <HI>A. P-E</HI> libell'd him in Manu|&s;cript while he liv'd, and in Print after he died.</P>
<P>'Tis a &s;ure Sign that we live in a poor, un|di&s;cerning, degenerate World, when one who has writ and acted as this little Gentleman has done, has been able to delude it &s;o long. But as he got &s;uch Favours by ungenerous Arts, he has work'd him&s;elf out of it, by his Weak|ne&s;s and his Ba&s;ene&s;s, by which he has made, by a mode&s;t Computation, a <HI>Hundred Thou|&s;and</HI> Enemies, and rais'd Indignation and Di&s;|dain in the Brea&s;t of every generous and &s;en|&s;ible Reader. He has not only attack'd &s;uch Numbers of People at one Time as no one
<PB N="xi" REF="14">
before him ever did in any Nation or any Age, but has gro&s;ly abus'd &s;everal very inge|nious Men; and &s;ome of them for no other Rea&s;on but becau&s;e they had &s;hewn an Under|&s;tanding, and Di&s;cernment, and a Sagacity greatly &s;uperior to his own: Among whom I am oblig'd, in Ju&s;tice, to name Mr. <HI>Theobald,</HI> who by delivering <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> from the Injuries of Time, and of lazy, or ignorant and &s;tupid Editors, has oblig'd all who are concern'd for the Reputation of &s;o great a Genius, or for the Honour of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It was for no other Rea&s;on that he has libell'd Mr. <HI>Theobald,</HI> Mr. <HI>Phillips,</HI> and &s;everal others, than that they have &s;urpa&s;s'd him. He has been &s;o far from making that Di&s;tinction which he ought to have done, that his Malice has been levell'd mo&s;t at tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Merit; which is a certain Proof, that this little envious Creature knows nothing of the Nature of Sa|tire, which can never exi&s;t where the Cen&s;ures are not ju&s;t. In that ca&s;e the Ver&s;ifyer, in|&s;tead of a Satiri&s;t, is a Lampooner, an infa|mous Libeller. None of the antient Satiri&s;ts, neither <HI>Horace,</HI> nor <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> nor <HI>Juvenal,</HI> ever attack'd Merit: And <HI>Boileau</HI> declares, <Q>That Merit is always precious to him; and that he has a greater E&s;teem for <HI>Patru</HI> in the mid&s;t of Indigence, than for one who has ama&s;s'd the greate&s;t Trea&s;ure by ba&s;e and unju&s;tifiable Means.</Q> He did not only &s;ay this, but &s;hew'd, by a very generous Action, that it was his real
<PB N="xii" REF="15">
Sentiment. <HI>Patru</HI> had a very noble Library, con&s;i&s;ting of a great Number of Volumes, and all of them very well cho&s;en. He was reduc'd by his Circum&s;tances to part with this Library, in order to &s;atisfy his Creditors. <HI>Boileau</HI> hearing of this, came and paid down the full Price for it, and never remov'd a Volume, but gave <HI>Patru</HI> the Enjoyment of the whole during the Remainder of his Life.</P>
<P>But the little Gentleman, who wrote the <HI>Dunciad</HI> and the <HI>Profund,</HI> does not only, with infinite Ba&s;ene&s;s, reproach Authors with Pover|ty, who have de&s;erv'd a thou&s;and times better both of their Country and the Commonwealth of Learning, to both which he is an open and a mortal Enemy; but he has the Impudence to infer their Want of Merit from their Want of Fortune. At this rate, <HI>Spencer,</HI> the renowned Lord <HI>Bacon, Butler,</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> were Dunces; and <HI>A. P-E,</HI> and <HI>Ned Howard,</HI> and two or three rich and noble Lords, are Poets and great Wits. At this rate <HI>Horace</HI> too was a Dunce, becau&s;e he was not only poor, before <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter ca&s;t a favour|able Eye upon him, but his Poverty made him a Poet. Such is the Account that he gives of him&s;elf in the &s;econd <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> of <HI>Book</HI> II.</P>
<Q><L>Quem dimi&s;&ecirc;re Philippi</L>
<L>Deci&s;is humilem pennis, inop&eacute;mque paterni</L>
<L>Et laris &amp; fundi; paupertas impulit audax,</L>
<L>Ut ver&s;us facerem.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="16">
If <HI>Horace</HI> was poor, <HI>Virgil</HI> was not rich, before the &s;ame magnanimous Prince, and his wi&s;e and di&s;cerning Mini&s;ter, took him into their Protection. Yet he was &s;o far from contemning Poverty, that he rather had a Con|tempt for Riches: Witne&s;s what he makes <HI>Evander</HI> &s;ay to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> in the 8th <HI>Aeneid,</HI> when he introduces him into the homely Pa|lace where <HI>Hercules</HI> had lain before.</P>
<Q><L>Ut ventum ad &s;edes; haec, inquit, limina victor</L>
<L>Alcides &s;ubiit; haec illum regia cepit.</L>
<L>Aude, ho&s;pes, contemnere opes, &amp; te quoque dignum</L>
<L>Finge Deo, rebu&s;que veni non a&s;per egenis.</L></Q>
<P>And in his Prai&s;e of a Country-Life, at the latter End of the &s;econd <HI>Georgic,</HI> he &s;eems to make Poverty the Foundation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Greatne&s;s.</P>
<Q><L>Agricola incurvo terram dimovit aratro;</L>
<L>Hinc anni labor; hinc patriam, parvo&s;que ne|potes</L>
<L>Su&s;tinet; hinc armenta boum, merito&s;que ju|vencos.</L></Q>
<P>Now what follows a little after this?</P>
<Q><L>Hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini,</L>
<L>Hanc Remus &amp; frater; &s;ic fortis Etruria crevit,</L>
<L>Scilicet &amp; rerum facta e&s;t pulcherrima Roma.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="17">
Which his Friend <HI>Horace</HI> &s;eems to have done before him, in the Ode to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> Lib. I.</P>
<Q><L>Regulum &amp; Scauros, animaeque magnae</L>
<L>Prodigum paulum, &s;uperante poena,</L>
<L>Dicam &amp; in&s;igni referem Camoena,</L>
<L>Fabriciumque.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Hunc &amp; incomptis curium capillis</L>
<L>Utilem bello tulit, &amp; Camillum</L>
<L>Saeva paupertas, &amp; avitus apto</L>
<L>Cum cure fundus.</L></Q>
<P>This I will venture to &s;ay, that there never was a great Poet in the World but he had a Contempt for Riches. Of which Opinion likewi&s;e is <HI>Horace:</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Vatis avarus</L>
<L>Non temere e&s;t animus, ver&s;us amat, hoc &s;tu|det unum.</L></Q>
<P>And there never was a little Poeta&s;ter, but he lov'd them, valu'd him&s;elf upon the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and did ba&s;e Things to acquire and to augment them.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;hew any one more weak or more ba&s;e, than to prefer Fortune to Merit, or vainly and vilely to endeavour to extol Fortune and to decry Merit. God has given extraordi|nary Merit to few, but he has &s;ubjected all to the Vici&s;&s;itudes of human Affairs, as well as to Di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="xv" REF="18">
and Death. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t power|ful of Monarchs are not exempted from the Power of Fortune, that is, from the unchange|able and irre&s;i&s;tible Decrees of Providence: Nay, the greater and more powerful any one is, the more deplorable Misfortunes is he &s;ubjected to. And therefore the Calamities of the Great ge|nerally &s;upply the fitte&s;t Subjects for &s;o noble a Poem as Tragedy.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the Vici&s;&s;itude of human Affairs, Men of the greate&s;t Fortune and Power ought not to value them&s;elves upon either: But for this little Gentleman to &s;trut and be conceited upon his having a Hundred a Year, to pretend to look down upon tho&s;e whom he never had Capacity to look up to; to call their good Sen&s;e and their Rea&s;oning Railing, becau&s;e nei|ther of them are his Talent; to &s;ay he will an&s;wer what they urge again&s;t him when he is as much <HI>in Debt</HI> as they are, at the &s;ame time that he owes his little Sub&s;tance to a <HI>vile Tran&s;|lation</HI> of a <HI>poor</HI> but <HI>excellent</HI> Poet, who if he was not <HI>in Debt,</HI> it was becau&s;e no Body would tru&s;t him: To do all this, entertains the Publick with the mo&s;t ridiculous Farce in the World. Notwith&s;tanding this, as long as he writes &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly as he has lately done, in &s;o degenerate an Age he will not be without Readers: For all Fools are fond of Scandal, becau&s;e all Fools are Levellers. But for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that he has their Approbation, he is contemn'd by Men of &s;ound Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="19">
And now I appeal to every impartial &s;en&s;ible Reader, who &s;hall have read this, and the fol|lowing Remarks, and who has formerly read tho&s;e upon <HI>Homer, Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> if I have not prov'd, both by convincing Rea&s;on and by undeniable Fact, That <HI>A.

<P>_I SHALL now, according to my Promi&s;e, &s;end you &s;ome <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions</HI> upon the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> which is one of the la&s;t Imitations of the little mimicking Bard, and one of the mo&s;t impertinent; to &s;o high a Degree impertinent, that I am afraid of being
<PB N="2" REF="21">
accus'd of writing a <HI>Satire</HI> upon <HI>Nothing,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> wrote a <HI>Panegyrick.</HI></P>
<P>The Faults of this ridiculous Poem begin at the Title-Page. I will not in&s;i&s;t upon the fanta&s;tical Compo&s;ition of the Word <HI>Heroi|Comical</HI>; but I de&s;ire Leave to dwell a little upon the Thing. What can this Author mean by creating in his Readers an Expectation of Plea&s;antry, when there is not &s;o much as one Je&s;t in his Book? Of all Blockheads he is the mo&s;t emphatically Dull, who, to an in&s;ipid tedious Tale, prefixes this impertinent Pre|lude; <HI>Now, Gentlemen, expect a very good Je&s;t! Now, my Ma&s;ters, prepare to laugh!</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>Heroi-Comical,</HI> it &s;hould have been <HI>Heroi Tragical,</HI> &s;ince it &s;eems there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for a fanta&s;tical Word: For there is a great deal of <HI>Tragedy</HI> in this Poem, but not one Jot of <HI>Comedy.</HI> But at the &s;ame Time there is nothing &s;o <HI>Tragical</HI> in it, as what the Author <HI>de&s;igns</HI> for <HI>Comedy:</HI> For when|ever he aims at a <HI>Je&s;t,</HI> 'tis &s;uch &s;ad deplora|ble Stuff, that he never fails to move <HI>Compa&s;|&s;ion</HI> by it.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, to pa&s;s from the <HI>Title-Page</HI> to the <HI>Dedication</HI>; he need not have been at the Trouble of acquainting his fair Patrone&s;s, that he publi&s;h'd what he calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> be|fore he had thought of what he calls his <HI>Ma|chinery:</HI> For the Book would have told her that, without the Epi&s;tle. For what he calls
<PB N="3" REF="22">
his <HI>Machinery</HI> has no Manner of Influence upon what he calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> not in the lea&s;t promoting, or preventing, or retarding the Action of it; as we &s;hall &s;hew more plainly when we come to treat of the <HI>Machines.</HI> He has taken his <HI>Machines,</HI> he tells us, from the <HI>Ro&s;ycrucians</HI>; and 'tis with them, he tells his fair Patrone&s;s, that he mu&s;t bring her ac|quainted. And how bring her acquainted? Why, he mu&s;t tell her what the Count <HI>de Ga|balis</HI> &s;ays of them, who has given, it &s;eems, the be&s;t Account that he knows of them. If he had not too much Pride, the natural ne|ce&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of his Capacity, to be in|&s;tructed; (for my Lord <HI>Ro&s;comon</HI> is certainly in the Right, when he tells us, that</P>
<Q><L>Pride, of all others, the mo&s;t dang'rous Fault,</L>
<L>Proceeds from Want of Sen&s;e, or Want of Thought:)</L></Q>
<P>I would direct him to a better Account of them, which is to be found in a Writer of our own, who is infinitely a better Judge both of Per&s;ons and Things, than the fanta&s;tick Count <HI>de Gabalis:</HI> and That is the mo&s;t ingenious and mo&s;t judicious Author of <HI>Hudibras,</HI> who has given this &s;hort Account of the <HI>Ro&s;ycrucians,</HI> in his Comment upon two Lines which are to be found in the Character of <HI>Ralpho,</HI> the facetious Squire of <HI>Hudibras, Canto</HI> I. <HI>Part</HI> 1.
<PB N="4" REF="23">
and which two I have cho&s;en for the Motto to the&s;e <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<Q><L>In <HI>Ro&s;ycrucian</HI> Lore as learned</L>
<L>As he that <HI>ver&egrave; Adeptus</HI> earned.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;hort Comment upon which is this:</P>
<Q>The Fraternity of the <HI>Ro&s;ycrucians</HI> is very like the Sect of the antient <HI>Gno&s;tici</HI>; who called them&s;elves &s;o from the excellent Learn|ing they pretended to, although they were really the mo&s;t ridiculous Sots of all Mankind.</Q>
<P>And then upon the Words <HI>Ver&egrave; Adeptus,</HI> &s;ays he,</P>
<Q><HI>Ver&egrave; Adeptus</HI> is one who has commenc'd in their Phanatick Extravagance.</Q>
<P>Thus, if we will believe <HI>Butler,</HI> who, as we &s;aid before, is an admirable Judge both of Books and of Mankind, this judicious Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has taken what he calls his <HI>Ma|chinery,</HI> from the <HI>Phanatick Extravagance</HI> of the mo&s;t ridiculous of all modern Sots; as their Predece&s;&s;ors the <HI>Gno&s;tici</HI> were the mo&s;t con|temptible ones of all the Antient; a Sect that is as becoming of this <HI>merry little Gentleman,</HI> as it was of the facetious Squire of <HI>Hudibras.</HI> And now tell me in good Earne&s;t, Sir, is not the <HI>Fair Lady</HI> infinitely oblig'd to him for her new Acquaintance?
<PB N="5" REF="24">
an Acquaintance very <HI>unbecoming Her,</HI> tho' very <HI>becoming</HI> of <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I done with the <HI>Title-Page</HI> and the <HI>Epi&s;tle.</HI> I &s;hall proceed to Morrow upon the Body of the Book. In the mean time I will a&s;&s;ure you for your Comfort, that you &s;hall never have a Letter of above a Sheet of Paper at a Time upon this <HI>impertinent Sub|ject.</HI> I am, Sir,</P>

<P>I HOPE mine of the fir&s;t of this Month came to your Hands, which contain'd &s;ome Reflections upon the <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Title|Page</HI> of the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI>; which latter creates an Expectation of <HI>Plea&s;antry</HI> in us, when there is not &s;o much as one <HI>Je&s;t</HI> in the Book.</P>
<Q><L>Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inept&egrave;?</L></Q>
<P><PB N="6" REF="25">
How much more judiciou&s;ly does <HI>Boileau</HI> ap|pear in the <HI>Title-Page</HI> of his <HI>Lutrin?</HI> In a &s;otti&s;h Emulation of which, <HI>this</HI> and &s;eve|ral late <HI>fanta&s;tick Poems</HI> appear both to you and me to have been writ. <HI>Boileau</HI> calls his <HI>Lutrin</HI> an <HI>Heroick Poem,</HI> and he is &s;o far from rai&s;ing an <HI>Expectation</HI> of Laughter, either in the <HI>Title,</HI> or in the <HI>Beginning of the Poem,</HI> that he tells Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lamoignon,</HI> to whom he addre&s;&s;es it, that 'tis a <HI>grave Subject,</HI> and mu&s;t be read with a <HI>grave Countenance.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Garde toy de rire en ce grave &s;ujet.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Butler</HI> mode&s;tly calls his <HI>Poem,</HI> by the Name of his Hero, <HI>Hudibras</HI>; and without endeavouring to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s his Reader, leaves the <HI>Poem</HI> it&s;elf to work its natural Effect upon him.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, &s;ince I have &s;aid that the <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> &s;eems to be writ in Imita|tion of the <HI>Lutrin,</HI> (I mean &s;o far in Imitation, that the Author had a Mind to get Reputa|tion by writing a great many Ver&s;es upon an <HI>incon&s;iderable Subject,</HI> as <HI>Boileau</HI> appears to have done before him;) I believe it will not be di&s;agreeable to you, if I &s;hew the Difference between the <HI>Lutrin</HI> and this <HI>fanta&s;tick Poem.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rape of the Lock</HI> is a very <HI>empty Trifle,</HI> without any <HI>Solidity</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ible Mean|ing</HI>; whereas the <HI>Lutrin</HI> is only a <HI>Trifle</HI> in
<PB N="7" REF="26">
<HI>Appearance,</HI> but under that Appearance car|ries a very grave and very important In&s;truc|tion: For if that <HI>Poem</HI> were only what it ap|pears to be, <HI>Boileau</HI> would run counter to the <HI>fam'd Rule</HI> which he has pre&s;crib'd to others.</P>
<Q><L>Auteurs, pr&ecirc;tez l' oreille &agrave; mes in&s;tructions,</L>
<L>Voulez vous faire aimer vos riches fictions?</L>
<L>Qu' en &s;&ccedil;avantes le&ccedil;ons votre mu&s;e fertile,</L>
<L>Par tout joigne au plai&s;ant le &s;olide &amp; l' utile?</L>
<L>Un lecteur &s;age fuit un vain amu&s;ement,</L>
<L>Et veut mettre &agrave; profit &s;on diverti&s;&s;ement.</L></Q>
<P>And which <HI>Horace</HI> has given before him.</P>
<Q><L>Centuriae &s;eniorum agitant expertia frugis:</L>
<L>Cel&s;i praetereunt au&s;tera poemata Ramnes.</L>
<L>Omne tulit punctum qui mi&s;cuit utile dulci,</L>
<L>Lectorem delectando, pariterque monendo.</L></Q>
<P>And the Rule which my Lord <HI>Ro&s;comon</HI> has given for <HI>Tran&s;lations,</HI> is certainly more &s;trong for <HI>Originals.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Take then a Subject proper to expound,</L>
<L>But moral, great, and worth a Poet's Voice,</L>
<L>For Men of Sen&s;e de&s;pi&s;e a trivial Choice,</L>
<L>And &s;uch Applau&s;e it mu&s;t expect to meet,</L>
<L>As would &s;ome Painter bu&s;y'd in a Street</L>
<L>To copy Bulls, and Bears, and every Sign,</L>
<L>That calls the &s;taring Sots to na&s;ty Wine.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="27">
Now &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o judicious an Author as <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;hould run counter to his own, and to the In&s;tructions of his Ma&s;ter <HI>Horace,</HI> the <HI>Lutrin</HI> at the Bottom cannot be an <HI>empty Trifle.</HI> 'Tis indeed a noble and im|portant &s;atirical Poem, upon the Luxury, the Pride, the Divi&s;ions, and Animo&s;ities of the Popi&s;h Clergy. 'Tis true indeed the <HI>admirable Addre&s;s</HI> of the Poet has made it in Appear|ance a <HI>Trifle</HI>; for otherwi&s;e it would not have been &s;uffer'd in a bigotted Popi&s;h Country. But yet <HI>Boileau</HI> in &s;ome Places &s;eems to have given broad Hints at what was his real Mean|ing; as in the following Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<Q><L>La Dee&s;&s;e en entrant, qui voit la nappe mi&s;e,</L>
<L>Admire un &s;i bel ordre, &amp; reconnoit l'egli&s;e.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And this other Pa&s;&s;age is &s;till more bold.</P>
<Q><L>Pour &s;outenir tes droits, que le ciel autori&s;e,</L>
<L>Abime tout plut&ocirc;t, c' e&s;t l' e&s;prit de l'egli&s;e.</L>
<BIBL>Lutrin, Chant. I.</BIBL></Q>
<P>As <HI>the Rape of the Lock</HI> is an <HI>empty Trifle,</HI> it can have no <HI>Fable</HI> nor any <HI>Moral</HI>; whereas the <HI>Lutrin</HI> has both <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI> 'Tis true, indeed, the <HI>Allegory</HI> under which that <HI>Moral</HI> is conceal'd, is not &s;o per&s;picuous as <HI>Boileau</HI> would have made it, if it had not been for the Apprehen&s;ion of provoking the
<PB N="9" REF="28">
Clergy. But, on the other Side, 'tis not &s;o ob&s;cure, but that a penetrating Reader may &s;ee through it. The Moral is, <HI>That when Chri|&s;tians, and e&s;pecially the Clergy, run into great Heats about religious Trifles, their Animo&s;ity proceeds from the Want of that Religion which is the Pretence of their Quarrel.</HI> The Fable is this; <Q>Two Per&s;ons being de&s;erted by true Piety, are embroil'd about a religious Trifle, to the Perplexity and Confu&s;ion of them and theirs: Upon the Return of Piety, they agree to &s;et a&s;ide the Trifle about which they dif|fer'd, and are reconcil'd, to the Quiet and Satisfaction both of them&s;elves and their Partizans.</Q></P>
<P>If you will be plea&s;ed to compare the Be|ginning of the Sixth <HI>Canto</HI> with the re&s;t of the Poem, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee that this Ac|count which I have given of the <HI>Lutrin</HI> is not without Foundation. But you know very well, Sir, that there is not the lea&s;t Shadow of a Mo|ral or Fable in the <HI>Rape.</HI></P>
<P>As nothing could be more ridiculous than the writing a full, an exact, and a regular Cri|tici&s;m upon &s;o empty a Bu&s;ine&s;s as this trifling Poem; I will &s;ay but a Word or two con|cerning the <HI>Incidents,</HI> and &s;o have done with what relates immediately to the <HI>De&s;ign.</HI> The Intention of the Author in writing this Poem, as we find in the Title-Page, is to rai&s;e the Mirth of the Reader; and we find by the Ef|fects which <HI>Hudibras</HI> and the <HI>Lutrin</HI> produce
<PB N="10" REF="29">
in us, that <HI>Butler</HI> and <HI>Boileau</HI> wrote with the &s;ame Intention. Now you know very well, Sir, that in a Poem which is built upon an Action, Mirth is chiefly to be rais'd by the <HI>Incidents.</HI> For Laughter in <HI>Comedy</HI> is chiefly to be excited, like Terror and Compa&s;&s;ion in Tragedy, by Surprize, when Things &s;pring from one another again&s;t our Expectation. Now whereas there are <HI>&s;everal</HI> ridiculous In|cidents in the <HI>Lutrin,</HI> as, The Owl in the Pul|pit frighting the nocturnal Champions; The Prelate's giving his Benediction to his Adver&s;a|ry, by way of Revenge and In&s;ult; The Bat|tle in the Book&s;eller's Shop, &amp;c. And where|as there are a thou&s;and &s;uch in <HI>Hudibras</HI>; There is not &s;o much as <HI>one,</HI> nor the <HI>Shadow of one,</HI> in the <HI>Rape of the Lock:</HI> Unle&s;s the Au|thor's Friends will object here, That his <HI>perpe|tual Gravity,</HI> after the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of his Title, makes the whole Poem one continued <HI>Je&s;t.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>May 8. 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I COME now to the <HI>Characters</HI> and the <HI>Machines.</HI> The Characters in the <HI>Lutrin</HI> are well mark'd. They are the true Re&s;em|blances of Men, of active Men, who pur&s;ue earne&s;tly what they are about. But there is no &s;uch Thing as a Character in the <HI>Rape of the Lock. Belinda,</HI> who appears mo&s;t in it, is a Chimera, and not a Character. She is repre|&s;ented by the Author perfectly <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>well-bred, mode&s;t</HI> and <HI>virtuous.</HI> Let us now &s;ee how he &s;u&s;tains the&s;e Qualities in her, and then we &s;hall di&s;cover what Ta&s;te he has of <HI>Nature</HI> and of <HI>Decorum.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then he repre&s;ents her perfectly <HI>beau|tiful:</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Sol</HI> thro' white Curtains did his Beams di&s;play,</L>
<L>And op'd tho&s;e Eyes which brighter &s;hone than they.</L></Q>
<P>And thus in the next Page the Sylphs ac|co&s;t her:
<PB N="12" REF="31"></P>
<Q><L>Faire&s;t of Mortals, thou di&s;tingui&s;h'd Care</L>
<L>Of thou&s;and bright Inhabitants of Air.</L></Q>
<P>And yet in the latter End of this very <HI>Canto</HI> he makes her owe the greater Part of her Beau|ty to her Toilette:</P>
<Q><L>Unnumber'd Trea&s;ures ope at once, and here</L>
<L>The various Offerings of the World appear;</L>
<L>From each &s;he nicely culls with curious Toil,</L>
<L>And decks the Godde&s;s with the glitt'ring Spoil,</L>
<L>This Casket <HI>India</HI>'s glowing Gems unlocks,</L>
<L>And all <HI>Arabia</HI> breathes from yonder Box.</L>
<L>Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms,</L>
<L>The Fair each Moment ri&s;es in her Charms,</L>
<L>Repairs her Smiles, awakens every Grace,</L>
<L>And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face,</L>
<L>Sees by Degrees a purer Blu&s;h ari&s;e,</L>
<L>And keener Lightnings quicken in her Eyes.</L></Q>
<P>Nay, the very <HI>favourite Lock,</HI> which is made the Subject for &s;o many Ver&s;es, is not &s;hewn &s;o de&s;irable for its native Beauty, as for the con|&s;tant Artifice employ'd about it. Witne&s;s what <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Belinda</HI> ju&s;t after &s;he had lo&s;t it:</P>
<Q><L>Was it for this you took &s;uch con&s;tant Care</L>
<L>The Bodkin, Comb, and E&s;&s;ence to prepare?</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="32">
For this your Locks in Paper Durance bound,</L>
<L>For this with torturing Irons wreath'd around?</L>
<L>For this with Fillets &s;train'd your tender Head,</L>
<L>And bravely bore the double Loads of Lead?</L></Q>
<P>Such Artifice mu&s;t deface the Lu&s;tre of Locks which were naturally lovely; and the Toilette mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity detract from perfect Beauty. The Toilette indeed may add to &s;ome who are call'd Beauties, or to &s;ome who would be thought &s;uch. A decay'd &s;uperannuated Beau|ty may receive Advantage from her Toilette, may <HI>ri&s;e</HI> in her Charms, and by the Help of <HI>Spani&s;h Red,</HI> a <HI>purer Blu&s;h may ari&s;e.</HI> But her <HI>counterfeit Charms</HI> can plea&s;e none who have a Ta&s;te of <HI>Nature</HI>; according to that of <HI>Ti|bullus:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Heu &s;er&ograve; revocatur amor, &s;er&ograve;que juventa,</L>
<L>Cum vetus infecit cana &s;enecta caput.</L>
<L>Tum &s;tudium formae e&s;t, coma t&ugrave;m mutatur ut annos</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;imulet, viridis cortice tincta nucis.</L></Q>
<P>But for her who has Youth and Beauty;</P>
<Q><L>Illa placet quamvis, inculto venerit ore,</L>
<L>Nec nitidum tard&acirc; comp&s;erit arte caput.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="14" REF="33">
Such a one wants neither <HI>Flounce</HI> nor <HI>Furbe|low,</HI> nor <HI>torturing Irons,</HI> nor <HI>Paper Durance.</HI> When God and Nature de&s;ign a Face to plea&s;e, the Fair-one, on whom they be&s;tow it, can ne|ver add to Workman&s;hip Divine. She may &s;poil it indeed by Indu&s;try, but can never im|prove it. They, who made it, alone know the certain Ways of going to the Heart of Man, and alone can give it tho&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s inimitable Graces which Indu&s;try does but &s;poil, and which Artifice does but hide.</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> was as fond of his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hair as any modern Lover can be: Witne&s;s what he &s;ays to <HI>Maecenas</HI> in the twelfth Ode of the &s;e|cond Book;</P>
<Q><L>Num tu, quae tenuit dives Achaemenes,</L>
<L>Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes</L>
<L>Permutare velis crine Licymniae,</L>
<L>Plenas aut Arabum Domos?</L></Q>
<P>And yet as he and the re&s;t of the antient Poets had an admirable Ta&s;te of Nature, they had quite another Ta&s;te of Beauty than what this Author di&s;covers; and believ'd that the brighte&s;t Ornament, either of the Hair or Face, was Simplicity and a becoming Negligence.</P>
<Q><L>Cui flavam religas comam</L>
<L>Simplex munditiis?</L></Q>
<P>Says <HI>Horace</HI> to <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> Ode V. Lib. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="34">
And in the eleventh Ode of <HI>Lib.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q><L>Quis Devium &s;cortum eliciet domo</L>
<L>Lyden? Eburna dic age cum lyr&acirc;</L>
<L>Maturet, incomptam Lacenae</L>
<L>More comam religata nodum.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Terence,</HI> who every where &s;o exactly imi|tates Nature, takes a quite different Cour&s;e from this Author to &s;hew a touching Beauty. The Pa&s;&s;age is in the fir&s;t Act of his <HI>Phormio:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Virgo pulchra! &amp; quo magis diceres,</L>
<L>Nil ad erat adjumenti ad pulchritudinem:</L>
<L>Capillus pa&s;&s;us, nudus pes, ip&s;a horrida:</L>
<L>Lacrymae, ve&s;titus turpis, ut ni vis boni</L>
<L>In ip&s;a ine&s;&s;et form&acirc;, haec formam extin|guerent.</L></Q>
<P>Here was no Care, neither of Hair, nor Face, nor Shape, and yet how much more charming does this <HI>Terentian</HI> Virgin appear, ev'n in Rags and Mi&s;ery, than <HI>Belinda</HI> does at her Toilette? I mean to tho&s;e who have a Ta&s;te of Nature. For &s;he, who ev'n in this mi&s;erable Plight mov'd all Beholders with Plea&s;ure, and <HI>Anti|pho</HI> with Love, what might &s;he not ju&s;tly be &s;uppos'd to do, adorn'd with a cleanly Negli|gence and Simplicity? I &s;ay, <HI>adorn'd</HI> with them; for it may truly be &s;aid of every ac|compli&s;h'd Beauty, what <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> &s;ays of one of his:
<PB N="16" REF="35"></P>
<Q><L>Di natura, d' amor, del cielo amici,</L>
<L>Le negligenze &s;ue &s;ono artifici.</L></Q>
<P>And our Ladies who &s;pend &s;o much Time at their Toilettes would do well to con&s;ider, that, after all the Pains which they take in adorning them&s;elves, they who are mo&s;t charm'd with their Per&s;ons, endeavour to retrieve their natu|ral Beauty in Imagination at lea&s;t, by dive&s;ting them of their borrow'd Ornaments, and cloathing them in the Simplicity of the rural Habit, when in their Sonnets they transform them to Shepherde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the Author has not only &s;hewn <HI>Belinda</HI> an accompli&s;h'd <HI>Beauty</HI>; he repre&s;ents her likewi&s;e a fine, mode&s;t, <HI>well-bred</HI> Lady:</P>
<Q><L>Favours to none, to all &s;he Smiles extends.</L>
<BIBL>Canto II.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And a little below,</P>
<Q><L>With graceful Ea&s;e and Sweetne&s;s, void of Pride.</L></Q>
<P>And yet in the very next <HI>Canto</HI> &s;he appears an arrant Ramp and a Tomrigg;</P>
<Q><L>The Nymph exulting fills with Shouts the Sky;</L>
<L>The Walls, the Woods, and long Canals reply.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="17" REF="36">
Mu&s;t not this be the legitimate Offspring of <HI>Stentor,</HI> to make &s;uch a Noi&s;e as that? The Nymph was within Doors, and &s;he mu&s;t &s;et up her Throat at a helli&s;h Rate, to make the Woods (where, by the by, there are none) and the Canals reply to it. Let us turn to the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI> and we &s;hall &s;ee her there as loud with Anger, as &s;he is now with Joy:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Re&s;tore the Lock,</HI> &s;he cries, and all around</L>

<L>Not fierce <HI>Othello</HI> in &s;o loud a Strain</L>
<L>Roar'd for the Handkerchief that caus'd his Pain.</L></Q>
<P>Well, but his Friends will object here, that this is an <HI>Hyperbole</HI>; and an Hyperbole is de|&s;ign'd to carry us beyond the Truth, only that it may make us enter more ju&s;tly into it: and that when <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Camilla,</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>May 9. 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the Promi&s;e made in my la&s;t, I am now to treat of the <HI>Machines</HI>; in the doing which I &s;hall lie under a great Di&s;|advantage: For before I come to tho&s;e of the <HI>Rape,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Ma|chines</HI> in general, of the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of introdu|cing them, of the <HI>Method</HI> us'd by the antient Poets in employing them, and of the <HI>Prac|tice</HI> of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of the Moderns.
<PB N="20" REF="39">
'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething to all the&s;e, in order to &s;hew the Ab&s;urdity of our Author's <HI>Machines,</HI> and his utter Ignorance of the Art he pretends to. But to treat of all the&s;e in as ample a Manner as the Subject de&s;erves, would require a Volume: And on the other Side, it would be extravagant to &s;pend a great deal of Time to &s;o in&s;ignificant an End. But when I con&s;ider that I write to a Gentleman who is perfectly well vers'd in the&s;e Matters, and who con&s;equently will comprehend a great deal by a little, I find to my Comfort that it will be ea&s;y to avoid both tho&s;e Inconveniences, of &s;aying a great deal, and of &s;aying no|thing.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons, that fir&s;t oblig'd tho&s;e Poets which are call'd Heroic to introduce <HI>Machines</HI> into their <HI>Poems,</HI> were,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To make their <HI>Fable</HI> and their <HI>Action</HI> more in&s;tructive: For, &s;ays <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> <Q>Lor&s;que les poetes &s;ont devenus philo&s;ophes moraux, ils n' ont pas ce&s;&s;&eacute; d'etre theologiens. Au con|traire, la morale quils traitent, les oblige indi&s;pen&s;ablement, de m&eacute;ler la divinit&eacute; dans leurs Ouvrages; parceque la conoi&s;&s;ance, la crainte, &amp; l' amour de Dieu, en un mot, la piete, &amp; la religion &s;ont les premiers, &amp; les plus &s;olides fondements, des autres vertus, &amp; de tout la morale.</Q></P>
<P>By introducing Machines into their Fables, the Epic Poets &s;hew'd two Things, 1. That the great Revolutions in human Affairs are influenc'd
<PB N="21" REF="40">
by a particular Providence. 2. That the Deity him&s;elf promotes the Succe&s;s of an Action form'd by Virtue, and conducted by Prudence. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Heroic Poets introduc'd <HI>Ma|chines</HI> into their Fables in order to make tho&s;e Fables more <HI>delightful:</HI> For the employing <HI>Machines</HI> made the Actions of tho&s;e Poems <HI>wonderful</HI>; now every Thing that is <HI>wonder|ful</HI> is of cour&s;e <HI>delightful.</HI> Let us &s;ee what one of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters among the Mo|derns &s;ays to this:</P>
<Q><L>Qu' Aenee &amp; &s;es vai&s;&s;eaux par les ventes ecartez,</L>
<L>Soient aux bords Affricains d'un orage em|portez,</L>
<L>Ce n' e&s;t qu' une avanture ordinaire &amp; com|mune,</L>
<L>Qu' un coup peu &s;urprenant, des traits de la fortune.</L>
<L>Mais que Junon con&s;tante en &s;on aver&s;ion,</L>

<L>Que Neptune en couroux, s'elevant &s;ur la mer,</L>
<L>D'un mot calme les flots, mette la paix dans l' air,</L>
<L>Deliure les vai&s;&s;eaux, des Syrtes les arrache,</L>
<L>C' e&s;t la ce qui &s;urprend, frappe, &s;ai&s;it, at|tache,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="41">
Sans tous ces ornamens le vers tombe en lan|gueur</L>
<L>La po&euml;&s;ie e&s;t morte, ou rampe &s;ans vigueur;</L>
<L>Le poete n'e&s;t plus, qu'un orateur timide</L>
<L>Qu' un froid hi&s;torien d'un fable in&s;ipide.</L></Q>
<P>This &s;ays the mo&s;t judicious M. <HI>De&s;preaux</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>; and the four la&s;t Lines remind me here of what I have at large di&s;cours'd upon other Occa&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the Epic Poets by their <HI>Machines</HI> made the <HI>Actions</HI> of their Fables more <HI>wonderful</HI> and more <HI>delightful,</HI> as well as more <HI>in&s;tructive</HI>; they likewi&s;e made the <HI>poetical Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> more <HI>wonderful</HI> and more <HI>delightful,</HI> &s;ince 'tis from them that they chiefly derive that Greatne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion which renders their Works &s;o Divine.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now come to the Practice of the an|tient Poets, and the Method which they made u&s;e of in introducing their <HI>Machines,</HI> in order to render their Poems more <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> and more <HI>delightful.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They took their <HI>Machines</HI> from the Re|ligion of their Country, upon which Account the&s;e <HI>Machines</HI> made the &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion, and made their Fables, and the Actions of them, <HI>probable</HI> as well as <HI>wonderful</HI>; for no|thing was more natural than for tho&s;e antient Heathens to believe that the Powers which they ador'd were wont to intermeddle in human
<PB N="23" REF="42">
Affairs, and to promote the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e De&s;igns which they favour'd; and nothing could be more natural for them, than to be|lieve that that De&s;ign mu&s;t pro&s;per which was e&s;pous'd by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But this was not all; for the <HI>Machines,</HI> by making the Actions of their Poems <HI>probable,</HI> made them <HI>wonderful</HI> to Men of Sen&s;e, who never can admire any Thing in Humanity which <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> will not let them believe. But,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The antient Poets made their <HI>Machines</HI> allegorical, as well as their human Per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They oppos'd them to one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They &s;hew'd a ju&s;t Subordination among them, and a ju&s;t Proportion between their Functions. While one was employ'd about the greate&s;t and the &s;ublime&s;t Things, ano|ther was not bu&s;ied about the mo&s;t trifling and mo&s;t contemptible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They always made their <HI>Machines</HI> in|fluence the Actions of their Poems; and &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Machines</HI> endeavour'd to <HI>advance</HI> the Action of their re&s;pective Poem, and others of them endeavour'd to <HI>retard</HI> it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. They made them infinitely more power|ful than the human Per&s;ons.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But, Secondly, The Practice of the greate&s;t modern Heroic Poets is conformable to that of the antient.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="24" REF="43">
<ITEM>1. They take their <HI>Machines</HI> from the Re|ligion of their Country; witne&s;s <HI>Milton, Cow|ley, Ta&s;&s;o.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They make them Allegorical.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They oppo&s;e them to one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They &s;hew a ju&s;t Subordination among them, and a ju&s;t Proportion between their Functions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has run counter to this Practice both of the Antients and Moderns. He has not taken his <HI>Machines</HI> from the Religion of his Country, not from any Religion, nor from Morality. His Machines contradict the Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, contradict all &s;ound Morality; there is no allegorical nor &s;en&s;ible Meaning in them; and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons they give no In&s;truction, make no Impre&s;&s;ion at all upon the Mind of a &s;en&s;ible Reader. In&s;tead of making the Ac|tion wonderful and delightful, they render it extravagant, ab&s;urd, and incredible. They do not in the lea&s;t influence that Action; they neither prevent the Danger of <HI>Belinda,</HI> nor promote it, nor retard it, unle&s;s, perhaps, it may be &s;aid, for one Moment, which is ridi|culous. And if here it be objected, that the Author de&s;ign'd only to <HI>entertain</HI> and <HI>amu&s;e</HI>; To that I an&s;wer, That for that very Rea&s;on he ought to have taken the utmo&s;t Care to
<PB N="25" REF="44">
make his Poem <HI>probable,</HI> according to the im|portant Precept of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ficta voluptatis cau&s;&acirc; &s;int proxima veris.</L></Q>
<P>And that we may be &s;atisfy'd that this Rule is founded in <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> we find by con&s;tant Experience, that any thing that &s;hocks <HI>Probability</HI> is mo&s;t in&s;ufferable in Comedy.</P>
<P>There is no Oppo&s;ition of the <HI>Machines</HI> to one another in this <HI>Rape of the Lock. Um|briel</HI> the <HI>Gnome</HI> is not introduc'd till the Action is over, and till <HI>Ariel</HI> and the Spirits under him, have quitted <HI>Belinda.</HI></P>
<P>There is no ju&s;t <HI>Subordination</HI> among the&s;e <HI>Machines,</HI> nor any ju&s;t <HI>Proportion</HI> between their <HI>Functions. Ariel</HI> &s;ummons them together, and talks to them as if he were their Em|peror.</P>
<Q><L>Ye <HI>Sylphs</HI> and <HI>Sylphids,</HI> to your Chief give ear,</L>
<L><HI>Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves,</HI> and <HI>Daemons,</HI> hear;</L>
<L>Ye know the Spheres and various Tasks a&s;|&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>By Laws eternal, to th' aerial Kind.</L>
<L>Some in the Fields of pure&s;t <HI>Aether</HI> play,</L>
<L>And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Day.</L>
<L>Some guide the Cour&s;e of wandring Orbs on high,</L>
<L>Or roll the Planets thro' the boundle&s;s Sky&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="45">
Or brew fierce Tempe&s;ts on the watry Main,</L>
<L>Or o'er the Glebe di&s;til the kindly Rain.</L>
<L>Others on Earth o'er human Race pre&s;ide,</L>
<L>Watch all their Ways, and all their Actions guide:</L>
<L>Of the&s;e the Chief the Care of Nations own,</L>
<L>And guard with Arms Divine the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, give me leave to ask you one Que&s;tion: Did you ever hear before that the Planets were roll'd by the aerial Kind? We have heard indeed of Angels and Intelli|gences who have perform'd the&s;e Functions: But they are va&s;t glorious Beings, of <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Kind, and <HI>Machines</HI> of another Sy&s;tem. Pray which of the <HI>aerial</HI> Kind have the&s;e <HI>&s;ublime</HI> Employments? For nothing can be more ri|diculous, or more contemptible, than the Em|ployments of tho&s;e whom he harangues</P>
<Q><L>To &s;ave the Powder from too rude a Gale,</L>
<L>Nor let th' impri&s;on'd E&s;&s;ences exhale.</L></Q>
<P>There is a Difference almo&s;t infinite between the&s;e vile Functions and the former &s;ublime ones, and therefore they can never belong to Beings of the &s;ame Species. Which of the aerial Kinds are the Movers of Orbs on high, or the Guardians of Empires below; when he who calls him&s;elf their Chief, is only the Keeper of a vile <HI>I&s;eland Cur,</HI> and has not &s;o
<PB N="27" REF="46">
much as the Intendance of the Lady's <HI>Favourite Lock,</HI> which is the Subject of the Poem? But that is entru&s;ted to an inferior Spirit, con|trary to all manner of Judgment and De|corum.</P>
<P>The <HI>Machines</HI> that appear in this Poem are infinitely le&s;s con&s;iderable than the <HI>human Per|&s;ons,</HI> which is without Precedent. Nothing can be &s;o contemptible as the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> or &s;o fooli&s;h as the <HI>Under&s;tandings</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Hob|goblins. Ariel</HI>'s Speech, for the fir&s;t thirty Lines, is one continu'd Impertinence: For, if what he &s;ays is true, he tells them nothing but what they knew as well as him&s;elf before. And when he comes at length to the <HI>Point,</HI> he is full as impertinent as he was in his <HI>Ramble</HI> before; for after he has talk'd to them of <HI>black Omens</HI> and <HI>dire Di&s;a&s;ters</HI> that threa|ten his Heroine, the&s;e Bugbears dwindle to the breaking a Piece of <HI>China,</HI> the &s;taining a <HI>Pet|ticoat,</HI> the lo&s;ing a <HI>Necklace,</HI> a <HI>Fan,</HI> or a Bot|tle of <HI>Sal Volatile.</HI> But we &s;hall con&s;ider this Pa&s;&s;age further when we come to examine the <HI>Sentiments</HI>; and then we &s;hall &s;ee, that <HI>Sawny</HI> takes the Change here, and 'tis <HI>He,</HI> a little <HI>Lump of Fle&s;h,</HI> that talks; in&s;tead of a little <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>That which makes this Speech more ridicu|lous, is the Place where it is &s;poken, and that is upon the Sails and Cordage of <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Barge; which is certainly taken from the two Kings of <HI>Brentford</HI> de&s;cending in Clouds, and
<PB N="28" REF="47">
&s;inging in the Style of our modern Spirits.</P>
<Q><L N="1"><HI>1 King.</HI> O &s;tay, for you need not as yet go a&s;tray,</L>
<L>The Tide, like a Friend, has brought Ships in our Way,</L>
<L>And on their high Ropes we will play.</L></Q>
<P>But now, Sir, for the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of the&s;e Sylphs and Sylphids, you &s;ee what Ideas the Threats of <HI>Ariel</HI> give us of them, when he threatens them, that for their Neglect they &s;hall</P>
<Q><L>Be &s;topt in Viols, or transfix'd with Pins,</L>
<L>Or plung'd in Lakes of bitter Wa&s;hes lie,</L>
<L>Or wedg'd whole Ages in a Bodkin's Eye.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Di&s;cord</HI> is de&s;crib'd by <HI>Homer</HI> with her Feet upon the Earth, and Head in the Skies: Upon which <HI>Longinus</HI> cries out, That this is not &s;o much the Mea&s;ure of <HI>Di&s;cord,</HI> as of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Capacity,</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of <HI>Genius.</HI> Ev'n &s;o the&s;e <HI>diminutive Beings</HI> of the intellectual World, may be &s;aid to be the <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Elevation</HI> of Genius. They are, indeed, Beings &s;o <HI>diminutive,</HI> that they bear the &s;ame Proportion to the re&s;t of the intellectual, that Eels in Vinegar do to the re&s;t of the material World. The latter are only to be &s;een thro' <HI>Micro&s;copes,</HI> and the former only thro' the fal&s;e Optics of a <HI>Ro&s;ycrucian</HI> Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="48">
I &s;hall mention but one or two more of the numerous Defects which are to be found in the <HI>Machines</HI> of this Poem; the one is, The Spirits, which he intends for <HI>benign</HI> ones, are <HI>malignant,</HI> and tho&s;e, which he de&s;igns for <HI>malignant,</HI> are <HI>beneficent</HI> to Mankind. The <HI>Gnomes</HI> he intends for <HI>malignant,</HI> and the <HI>Sylphs</HI> for <HI>beneficent</HI> Spirits. Now the <HI>Sylphs</HI> in this Poem promote that <HI>Female Vanity</HI> which the <HI>Gnomes</HI> mortify. And Vanity is not only a great Defect in Human Nature, but the Mother of a thou&s;and Errors, and a thou|&s;and Crimes, and the Cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the Misfortunes which are incident to Huma|nity.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Defect that I &s;hall take notice of, is, That the <HI>Machines</HI> in this Poem are not ta|ken from <HI>one Sy&s;tem,</HI> but are <HI>double,</HI> nay <HI>tre|ble</HI> or <HI>quadruple.</HI> In the fir&s;t <HI>Canto</HI> we hear of nothing but <HI>Sylphs,</HI> and <HI>Gnomes,</HI> and <HI>Sa|lamanders,</HI> which are <HI>Ro&s;ycrucian</HI> Vi&s;ions. In the &s;econd we meet with <HI>Fairies, Genii,</HI> and <HI>Daemons,</HI> Beings which are unknown to tho&s;e Fanatick Sophi&s;ters. In the fourth, <HI>Spleen</HI> and the <HI>Phantoms</HI> about, are deriv'd from the Powers of <HI>Nature,</HI> and are of a &s;eparate Sy&s;tem. And <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Jove,</HI> which we find in the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI> belong to the Heathen Re|ligion.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, in treating of the&s;e Matters, I have, before I perceiv'd it, tran&s;gre&s;s'd the
<PB N="30" REF="49">
Bounds which I pre&s;crib'd to my &s;elf, which I de&s;ire that you would excu&s;e.</P>

<P>I HAVE now &s;hewn that there is no &s;uch Thing as a <HI>Fable</HI> or <HI>Characters</HI> in the Poem of the <HI>Rape,</HI> and that what he calls his <HI>Machinery</HI> is mo&s;t extravagantly cho&s;en. I now come to the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> which are more ab&s;urd than the re&s;t, and of &s;uch an odd Com|po&s;ition, that they are at one and the &s;ame Time both <HI>trivial</HI> and <HI>extravagant.</HI></P>
<P>The Ab&s;urdity of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> begins with the Book, and the Author &s;tumbles at the Thre&s;hold.</P>
<Q><L>What dire Offence from amorous Cau&s;es &s;prings,</L>

<P><PB N="31" REF="50">
Where in three Lines there are no le&s;s than two Errors in the <HI>Sentiments.</HI> For, in the fir&s;t Place, tho' the Author has neither <HI>Fable</HI> nor <HI>general Action,</HI> yet he propo&s;es to &s;ing &s;omething <HI>general,</HI> rather than that <HI>particular Action</HI> which is the <HI>Subject</HI> of his Poem, and he begins as if he de&s;ign'd to make the Rea|der expect a <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> of Love-Quarrels; which Proceeding is ju&s;t contrary to the Practice of <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and to the Dictates of <HI>right Rea&s;on. Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> had <HI>ac|compli&s;h'd Fables,</HI> and their <HI>Actions</HI> at the Bottom were <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and <HI>allegorical:</HI> Yet they each of them propos'd to &s;ing the&s;e <HI>Actions,</HI> as they had <HI>particulariz'd</HI> them by the Impo&s;ition of Names. <HI>Homer</HI> begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Mu&s;e, &s;ing the baleful Fury of <HI>Achilles.</HI></L></Q>
<P>And <HI>Virgil</HI> thus:</P>
<Q><L>Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris</L>
<L>Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit</L>
<L>Littora.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>In the third Line he does not invoke the Mu&s;e to &s;ing, but propo&s;es to do it him&s;elf: And tho' he names the Mu&s;e immediately af|terwards, he does it, for&s;ooth, to acquaint her, that 'tis not &s;he, but <HI>Belinda,</HI> that is to in|&s;pire him:</P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="51">
<L>&mdash;This Ver&s;e to <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Mu&s;e is due,</L>

<L>Slight is the Subject, but not &s;o the Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>If &s;he in&s;pire, and He approve my Lays.</L></Q>
<P>So that he has de&s;ir'd no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Mu&s;e,</HI> and none &s;he has afforded him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> indeed could not po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this Ca&s;e. The <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> is a Machine like <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Jove,</HI> belonging originally to the <HI>Ethnic</HI> Sy&s;tem, and transferr'd &s;ometimes to the Chri&s;tian Religion only allegorically; and the <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> cannot be &s;uppos'd to bring him acquainted with <HI>Ro&s;ycrucian</HI> Spirits, which would de&s;troy her own Divinity, either as Heathen or Chri&s;tian, &s;ince they are Beings utterly unknown, either to the <HI>Ethnic</HI> Sy&s;tem, or to the Chri&s;tian Religion: So that 'tis <HI>Be|linda,</HI> and not the <HI>Mu&s;e,</HI> that is to in&s;pire him. He introduces <HI>her</HI> into the Acquaintance of the <HI>Sylphs</HI> and <HI>Sylphids</HI> in his Epi&s;tle, and &s;he is to bring <HI>him</HI> acquainted with them in the Body of the Book. And now, Sir, is not this very <HI>ingeniou&s;ly,</HI> and very <HI>judiciou&s;ly</HI> contriv'd? He has de&s;ir'd no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Mu&s;e,</HI> and, as I &s;aid before, none he has had from her. The whole Poem &s;eems to have been infus'd by a <HI>Coquette,</HI> and not in&s;pir'd by a <HI>Mu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I have already acquainted you, Sir, that I would not in the <HI>Examen</HI> of this Poem confine my &s;elf to an exact and regular Method: For neither is the Subject worth the while, nor
<PB N="33" REF="52">
ought a Letter to a Friend to be writ with any Re&s;traint. I &s;hall therefore take the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of this Poem as they come in my way, without pretending to rank them under their re&s;pective Cla&s;&s;es, excepting perhaps the <HI>Puns,</HI> which are numerous, and by which the Author fre|quently &s;hocks not only the Dictates of <HI>Good Sen&s;e,</HI> and the Rules of <HI>true Plea&s;antry,</HI> but tho&s;e of <HI>Grammar</HI> and <HI>common Engli&s;h.</HI> But tho&s;e we &s;hall omit till we have done with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There is in this fir&s;t <HI>Canto, pag.</HI> 4. a very unlucky Imitation of a Pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Quae gratia curr&ucirc;m</L>
<L>Armorumque fuit vivis, quae cura nitentes</L>
<L>Pa&s;cere equos; eadem &s;equitur tellure repo&s;tos.</L></Q>
<P>Which the Author of the <HI>Rape</HI> has thus imi|tated:</P>
<Q><L>Think not, when Woman's tran&s;ient Breath is fled,</L>
<L>That all her Vanities at once are dead,</L>
<L>Succeeding Vanities &s;he &s;till regards,</L>
<L>And tho' &s;he plays no more o'erlooks the Cards:</L>
<L>Her Joy in gilded Chariots when alive,</L>
<L>And Love of Ombre, after Death &s;urvive.</L></Q>
<P>Now there is this remarkable Difference be|tween the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages, that what <HI>Virgil</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="53">
&s;ays of the Souls in the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields, that they were pleas'd with the &s;ame Diver&s;ions after Death, of which they were fond in their Life-times, does by no means contradict any Doctrine of that Religion which the <HI>Romans</HI> deriv'd from the <HI>Grecians</HI>; but the Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Rape</HI> &s;hocks the fundamental Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and is therefore a mo&s;t ab&s;urd Imitation.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn, in &s;peaking of the <HI>Characters,</HI> how injudicious all that Pa&s;&s;age is, in the 8th and 9th Pages, which relates to the Toilette: And as I do not pretend to &s;hew all his Errors, but only &s;ome few which are very gro&s;s ones, I &s;hall now pa&s;s to the &s;econd <HI>Canto</HI>; in which <HI>Canto,</HI> pag. 11. there is a Remark that cannot but be the Effect of ve|ry <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and very <HI>deep</HI> Ob&s;ervation:</P>
<Q><L>With hairy Springes we the Birds betray,</L>
<L>Slight Lines of Hair &s;urprize the finny Prey,</L>
<L>Fair Tre&s;&s;es Man's impertal Race in&s;nare,</L>
<L>And Beauty draws us with a &s;ingle Hair.</L></Q>
<P>That is to &s;ay, <HI>Birds</HI> are caught by the <HI>Heels,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> by the <HI>Jaws,</HI> with <HI>Hor&s;e-Hair</HI>; and <HI>Men</HI> are hamper'd by the <HI>Souls</HI> with <HI>Wo|man's Hair.</HI> Tell me truly, Sir, is not this the Effect of very <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and very <HI>deep</HI> Ob&s;er|vation? I have been &s;o taken with the&s;e four Ver&s;es, that I could not forbear making the four following in Imitation of them.</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="54">
<L>With jingling Bells Night-Fowlers Birds betray,</L>
<L>With the&s;e Night-Anglers catch the finny Prey:</L>
<L>Small Poets hamper Fools by jingling Rhimes,</L>
<L>And Non&s;en&s;e draws them by its &s;en&s;ele&s;s Chimes.</L></Q>
<P>In this &s;econd <HI>Canto, pag.</HI> 12. we have ano|ther Imitation of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and one ten times more unhappy than the former in the fir&s;t <HI>Canto.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Virgil</HI> is in the &s;econd Book of the <HI>Aeneis:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Dolus, an virtus, quis in ho&s;te requirit?</L></Q>
<P>That is to &s;ay, If a Captain obtains a Victory, few enquire whether he ow'd it to Stratagem or open Force.</P>
<P>The Imitation is included in the following Lines:</P>
<Q><L>Th' adventurous Baron the bright Lock admir'd,</L>
<L>He &s;aw, he wi&s;h'd, and to the Prize a&s;pir'd;</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to win, he meditates the Way</L>
<L>By Force to ravi&s;h, or by Fraud betray:</L>
<L>For when Succe&s;s a Lover's Toil attends,</L>
<L>Few ask, if Fraud or Force attain'd his Ends.</L></Q>
<P>Now the Mi&s;chief of it is, that if a Lover ob|tains his Ends by <HI>Force,</HI> the whole Country makes a very &s;evere Enquiry into it, by their
<PB N="36" REF="55">
Repre&s;entative, a <HI>petty Jury</HI>; and if he hap|pens to be convicted of it, in that Ca&s;e poor Culprit pa&s;&s;es his Time but &s;curvily.</P>
<P>In the Letter, which I lately &s;ent you con|cerning the <HI>Characters,</HI> I mention'd &s;everal of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> which are to be found in <HI>Ariel</HI>'s Speech: But I know not how I omitted that which follows:</P>
<Q><L>To fifty cho&s;en Sylphs of &s;pecial Note</L>
<L>We tru&s;t, th' important Charge, the Petticoat:</L>
<L>Oft have we known that &s;evenfold Fence to fail,</L>
<L>Though &s;tiff with Hoops, and arm'd with Ribs of Whale.</L></Q>
<P>Where, Sir, 'tis ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that as 'tis <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Petticoat of which he commits the important Charge to the Sylphs; 'tis the Pet|ticoat of the &s;ame <HI>Belinda,</HI> according to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Meaning, and all true grammatical Con&s;truction, that he has known &s;o often to fail in &s;pight of the Hoops of Whalebone. And now I leave you to judge if there was not Rea&s;on for telling Mrs. <HI>Arabella,</HI> in the Epi&s;tle, that Madam <HI>Belinda</HI> was not like her.</P>
<P>There &s;eems indeed to be a <HI>terrible Shock</HI> made upon the &s;ame Petticoat, in the Begin|ning of the fifth <HI>Canto,</HI><HI> pag.</HI> 42.</P>
<Q><L>All &s;ide in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</L>
<L>Fans clap, Silks rattle, and tough Whale-bones crack.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="37" REF="56">
By <HI>tough Whalebones</HI> he cannot mean tho&s;e of the <HI>Fans,</HI> for they are <HI>limber</HI> enough. Be|&s;ides, <HI>Fans</HI> were mention'd in the Beginning of this la&s;t Ver&s;e. The <HI>tough Whale-bones</HI> then, at he latter End of it, are tho&s;e of the <HI>Petticoat,</HI> and could not po&s;&s;ibly be heard to <HI>crack,</HI> unle&s;s a <HI>violent Attack</HI> had been made upon it.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of <HI>Pag.</HI> 15. <HI>Canto</HI> III. there is a very notable Thought:</P>
<Q><L>Coffee, which makes the Politician wi&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;ee through all Things with his half-&s;hut Eyes,</L>
<L>Sent up in Vapours to the Baron's Brain</L>
<L>New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain.</L></Q>
<P>Now what was this <HI>new Stratagem,</HI> or the&s;e <HI>new Stratagems?</HI> Why, the Baron comes <HI>be|hind Belinda</HI> as &s;he was drinking her Coffee, and, &s;nap, off goes the <HI>Lock.</HI> Now if this was the <HI>new Stratagem,</HI> what in the Name of <HI>Impertinence</HI> could be the <HI>old one?</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>profounde&s;t</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> Reflections of all, are at the End of this third <HI>Canto.</HI></P>
<Q><L>What Time would &s;pare, from Steel receives its Date,</L>
<L>And Monuments, like Men, &s;ubmit to Fate:</L>
<L>Steel did the Labour of the Gods de&s;troy,</L>
<L>And &s;trike to Du&s;t th' imperial Tow'rs of <HI>Troy</HI>&punc;</L>

Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound,</L>
<L>And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground.</L>
<L>What Wonder then, fair Nymph, thy Hair &s;hould feel</L>
<L>The conquering Force of unre&s;i&s;ting Steel?</L></Q>
<P>Why, who the Devil, be&s;ides this Bard, ever made a Wonder of it? What! before <HI>Troy</HI> Town, and triumphal Arches were built, was the cutting off a Lock of Hair a <HI>miraculous</HI> Thing?

<Q><L>What Time would &s;pare, from <HI>Fire</HI> receives its Date,</L>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Complaint which you make of my long Silence, and the Interruption of this <HI>weighty</HI> Affair, &s;eems to be a Return to that Compliment which I de&s;ign'd to make you, by di&s;continuing my Ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e arrant <HI>Bawbles.</HI> It was in Complai&s;ance to you that I began to make them; and it was out of Re&s;pect to your Judgment that I left them off. They began to run into Length, and I thought I might as rea&s;onably entertain you with voluminous Remarks upon <HI>Mites</HI> in <HI>Chee&s;e,</HI> or upon <HI>Eels</HI> in <HI>Vinegar,</HI> as with te|dious Ob&s;ervations on Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Poems.</P>
<P>But &s;ince 'tis your De&s;ire that I &s;hould make an end of what I have begun. I am re&s;olv'd to comply with it, as far as my Indi&s;po&s;ition, and my Affairs, and the Satiety which I have con|tracted in &s;aying &s;o much already, will permit me. For the Difficulty here does not lie in <HI>making Remarks,</HI> but in <HI>Reading.</HI> The Faults are &s;o gro&s;s and &s;o numerous, that there is no more Plea&s;ure in finding them, than there is in hunting in a Hare-Warren.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="59">
I am now come to the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> which are to be found in the fourth and fifth <HI>Cantos</HI> of this notable Poem. I &s;hall only take no|tice of a very few, by which you and your Friends may judge of the whole.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I &s;hall take notice of, is the impertinent Journey of <HI>Umbriel</HI> the <HI>Gnome,</HI> who</P>
<Q><L>Down to the central Earth, his proper Scene,</L>
<L>Repairs to &s;earch the gloomy Cave of Spleen.</L>
<BIBL>Pag. 3.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Now to what Purpo&s;e does this fanta&s;tick Being take this Journey? Why, to give <HI>Be|linda</HI> the Spleen. In order to which, <HI>Spleen</HI> equips him with a <HI>Bottle</HI> and a <HI>Bag,</HI> as a Country Dame does her <HI>Plough-Jobber,</HI> to equip him for his Day's Work.</P>
<Q><L>A wondrous Bag with both her Hands &s;he binds,</L>
<L>Like that where once <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> held the Winds;</L>
<L>There &s;he collects the Force of female Lungs,</L>
<L>Sighs, Sobs, and Pa&s;&s;ions, and the War of Tongues.</L>
<L>A Viol next &s;he fills with fainting Fears,</L>
<L>Soft Sorrows, melting Griefs, and flowing Tears.</L></Q>
<P>Now what could be more impertinent than this Journey of <HI>Umbriel,</HI> or more vain and
<PB N="41" REF="60">
u&s;ele&s;s than this Gift of <HI>Spleen,</HI> whether we look upon the <HI>Bag</HI> or the <HI>Bottle?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Umbriel</HI> de&s;cends to the <HI>central Earth</HI> to give <HI>Belinda</HI> the <HI>Spleen.</HI> Now 'tis plain, that before his De&s;cent he leaves her <HI>mad,</HI> and up|on his Return, finds her in a <HI>Fit of the Mother.</HI></P>
<P>That before his Journey he leaves her <HI>mad,</HI> is I think pretty plain, from <HI>pag.</HI> 28.</P>
<Q><L>Then fla&s;h'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</L>
<L>And <HI>Screams</HI> of <HI>Horror</HI> rend th' <HI>affrighted</HI> Skies.</L>
<L>Not <HI>louder Shrieks</HI> by Dames to Heaven are ca&s;t&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>That upon his Return he finds her in a <HI>Fit of the Mother,</HI> is manife&s;t from <HI>p.</HI> 35.</P>
<Q><L>Sunk in <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI>' Arms the Nymph he found,</L>
<L>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</L></Q>
<P>How ab&s;urd was it then for this <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> to take a Journey down to the <HI>central Earth,</HI> for no other Purpo&s;e than to give her the <HI>Spleen,</HI> whom he left and found in the Height of it? And why does this impertinent Devil, who <HI>&s;ees</HI> this, give him&s;elf the Trouble which he takes in the following Lines:</P>
<Q><PB N="42" REF="61">
<L>Full o'er their Heads the &s;welling Bag he rent,</L>
<L>And all the Furies i&s;&s;u'd at the Vent,</L>
<L><HI>Belinda</HI> burns with more than mortal Ire. <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Now, pray, what were the <HI>Furies</HI> enclos'd in this Bag? Why we were told what they were a little higher, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Force</HI> of <HI>female Lungs,</HI> and <HI>Bedlam Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and the <HI>War</HI> of <HI>Tongues.</HI> Now could <HI>Belinda</HI> have more of tho&s;e than &s;he had before the <HI>Gnome</HI> took his Journey?</P>
<Q><L>Then fla&s;h'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes,</L>
<L>And Screams of Horror rend th' affrighted Skies.</L></Q>
<P>And as for the <HI>Bottle,</HI> that &s;eems like <HI>Trinca. lo</HI>'s, rather to <HI>comfort</HI> her, than to <HI>ferment</HI> her more. For let us but con&s;ider the Condi|tion in which <HI>Umbriel</HI> found her upon his Return;</P>
<Q><L>Sunk in <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI>' Arms the Nymph he found,</L>
<L>Her Eyes dejected, and her Hair unbound.</L></Q>
<P>That is to &s;ay, &s;he was <HI>&s;tark mad.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us compare this Condition with that in which &s;he appears after &s;he has a <HI>Dram</HI> of the <HI>Bottle?</HI></P>
<Q><L>But <HI>Umbriel,</HI> hateful Gnome, forbears not &s;o,</L>
<L>He breaks the Viol whence the Sorrows flow.</L></Q>
<P>Now, pray, what is the Con&s;equence? Why <HI>Be|linda</HI> of a &s;udden comes to her&s;elf, holds up
<PB N="43" REF="62">
her Head, and is calm enough to make Re|flections.</P>
<P>The next Thing I &s;hall take notice of, is the <HI>Equipage</HI> of <HI>Spleen,</HI> and this Author's giving her <HI>two Handmaids,</HI> the one of which ought rather to be her <HI>Mother</HI> than her <HI>Maid,</HI> and the other can have nothing at all to do with her.</P>
<Q><L>Two Handmaids wait the Throne, alike in Place,</L>
<L>But diff'ring far in Figure and in Face.</L>
<L>Here &s;tood Ill-Nature, <HI>like an</HI> antient <HI>Maid</HI>&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Here the Author, with a great deal of Judg|ment makes a <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> &s;ubordinate to a <HI>Par|ticular. Ill-Nature</HI> may with &s;ome Colour be &s;aid to be the <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Spleen,</HI> but &s;he can never be call'd her <HI>Maid,</HI> without &s;hocking common Sen&s;e. The <HI>Nature</HI> of a Man mu&s;t be <HI>coeval</HI> to the <HI>Man,</HI> and mu&s;t far <HI>precede</HI> any Thing that the World calls <HI>Spleen</HI> in him. But let us take a View of her other Hand|maid, <HI>pag.</HI> 32.</P>
<Q><L>There <HI>Affectation</HI> with a &s;ickly Mien,</L>
<L>Shews in her Cheeks the Ro&s;es of eighteen.</L></Q>
<P>Now <HI>Affectation</HI> can never have any Thing to do with <HI>Spleen. Spleen</HI> is the <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which is <HI>Nature</HI>; <HI>Affectation</HI> is the <HI>Child</HI> of <HI>Tranquillity,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part is nothing but <HI>counterfeit Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now he, who has violent Pa&s;&s;ions of his <HI>own,</HI> is hardly
<PB N="44" REF="63">
at lei&s;ure to counterfeit tho&s;e which are <HI>foreign</HI> to him; and therefore it has been often &s;een, that when too much <HI>Felicity</HI> has made a Fop <HI>affected, Spleen</HI> and <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> have brought him back to <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>I will not take notice of the various Er|rors in the De&s;cription of what he calls the <HI>Palace of Spleen.</HI> I &s;hall content my&s;elf with the Mention of one of them, which may not improperly be call'd the <HI>impo&s;&s;ible Transfor|mation.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Unnumber'd Throngs on ev'ry Side are &s;een</L>
<L>Of Bodies chang'd to various Forms by Spleen;</L>
<L>Here living Tea-pots &s;tand, one Arm held out,</L>
<L>One bent; the Handle this, and that the Spout.</L>
<L>A Pipkin there, like <HI>Homer</HI>'s Tripod walks,</L>
<L>Here &s;ighs a Jar, and there a Goo&s;e-pie talks:</L>
<L>Men prove with Child, as pow'rful Fancy works,</L>
<L>And Maids, turn'd Bottles, call aloud for Corks.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, I appeal to you and your Friends, if ever there was &s;uch execrable Stuff, &s;uch la|mentable, &s;uch deplorable Plea&s;antry! What &s;ays <HI>Horace?</HI></P>
<Q><L>Scribendi rect&egrave; &s;apere e&s;t &amp; principium &amp; &s;ons.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Good Sen&s;e is the &s;ole Foundation of good Wri|ting.</HI> And, according to him, <HI>Boileau</HI>;</P>
<Q>


<L>Quelque &s;ujet qu' on traite, ou plai&s;ant, ou &s;ub|lime,</L>
<L>Que toujours le bon &s;ens s'accorde avec le rime.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="45" REF="64">
<HI>Good Sen&s;e is the only Foundation both of Plea&s;antry and Sublimity:</HI> But that which is out of <HI>Truth,</HI> is certainly out of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Good Sen&s;e.</HI> Now was ever any Thing more out of <HI>Truth</HI> than the foregoing De&s;cription? In&s;tead of giving <HI>Spleen</HI> a Power to bring <HI>me|lancholy Delu&s;ions</HI> upon Mortals, and to cheat them with <HI>fal&s;e Appearances,</HI> this Author gives her the Power really to <HI>transform Bodies,</HI> and makes <HI>Umbriel</HI> the <HI>Gnome,</HI> who, as a Spi|rit, is &s;uppos'd to &s;ee Things as they are, <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>really</HI> to behold that <HI>extravagant Tran&s;|formation.</HI> But &s;o much for the Sentiments of the fourth <HI>Canto.</HI></P>
<P>As the fifth is very &s;hort, and very in&s;ipid, and as your humble Servant is very much tir'd, I &s;hall make but two Ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of it there is a <HI>rampant Scuffle,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e our Author took from the <HI>Rankne&s;s</HI> of a <HI>Buttock-Ball,</HI> &s;o little is it becoming of Per&s;ons of Condition.</P>
<Q><L>All &s;ide in Parties, and begin th' Attack,</L>
<L>Fans clap, Silks ru&s;tle, and tough Whale-bones crack,</L>
<L>Heroes and Heroines Shouts confus'dly ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And ba&s;s and treble Voices &s;trike the Skies:</L>
<L>No common Weapons in their Hands are found,</L>
<L>Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal Wound.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="46" REF="65">
The latter Part is &s;omething odd in the Mouth of the Tran&s;lator of <HI>Homer,</HI> who ought to know, that both <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> had been wounded by <HI>Diomedes.</HI> But if no <HI>common Weapons</HI> are found in the Hands of the&s;e Combatants, pray what Weapons are they which make the <HI>Silks to ru&s;tle,</HI> and the <HI>Whale|bones to crack?</HI> But let us con&s;ider what follows:</P>
<Q><L>So when bold <HI>Homer</HI> makes the Gods engage,</L>
<L>And heavenly Brea&s;ts with human Pa&s;&s;ions rage,</L>
<L>'<HI>Gain&s;t</HI> Pallas, Mars, Latona, Hermes <HI>arms,</HI></L>
<L>And all <HI>Olympus</HI> rings with loud Alarms:</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI>'s Thunder roars, Heav'n trembles all around,</L>
<L>Blue <HI>Neptune</HI> &s;torms, the bellowing Deeps re&s;ound,</L>
<L>Earth &s;hakes her nodding Tow'rs, the Ground gives way,</L>
<L>And the pale Gho&s;ts &s;tart at the Fla&s;h of Day.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Sir, who &s;ays that this Pa&s;&s;age is not very ju&s;tly applied to a <HI>Catterwauling?</HI> But the latter Part of it is not taken from <HI>Homer,</HI> but from his mo&s;t impertinent Imitator Mon|&s;ieur <HI>De la Motte,</HI> and neither the one nor the other Trifler &s;eem to have known any thing in this Pa&s;&s;age, of the Solemnity, and the dreadful Maje&s;ty of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>In the Beginning of the next Page the fol|lowing Lines are full of mi&s;erable Plea&s;antry:</P>
<Q><PB N="47" REF="66">
<L>While thro' the Pre&s;s enrag'd <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> flies,</L>
<L>And &s;catters Death around from both her Eyes,</L>
<L>A Beau and Witling peri&s;h'd in the Throng,</L>
<L>One died in Metaphor, and one in Song.</L>
<L>O cruel Nymph! a living Death I bear,</L>
<L>Cry'd <HI>Dapperwit,</HI> and &s;unk beneath his Chair.</L>
<L>A mournful Glance, Sir <HI>Fopling</HI> upwards ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e Eyes are made &s;o killing!&mdash;was his la&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>So that here we have a <HI>real Combat</HI> and a <HI>metaphorical dying.</HI> Now is not that, Sir, very ludicrous? What, did he fight, or make Love, as Profe&s;&s;ors read, or as Popes fulmi|nate <HI>ex Cathedr&acirc;?</HI> I cannot imagine how he could do that, unle&s;s he had got <HI>Belinda</HI> or <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> upon his Lap.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I gone thro' &s;everal of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> upon the <HI>Rape,</HI> which are either <HI>trifling,</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> But there are a great many Lines, which have <HI>no Sentiment</HI> at all in them, that is, no <HI>rea&s;onable Meaning.</HI> Such are the <HI>Puns</HI> which are every where &s;pread throughout it. <HI>Puns</HI> bear the &s;ame Propor|tion to <HI>Thought,</HI> that <HI>Bubbles</HI> hold to <HI>Bodies,</HI> and may ju&s;tly be compared to tho&s;e gaudy Bladders which Children make with Soap; which, tho' they plea&s;e their weak Capacities with a momentary Glittering, yet are but ju&s;t beheld, and vani&s;h into Air. Of this Nature is that Pun in the 5<HI>th Canto, p.</HI> 44.</P>

<L>See fierce <HI>Belinda</HI> on the Baron flies,</L>
<L>With more than u&s;ual Lightning in her Eyes,</L>

<P>That is to &s;ay, <HI>He wi&s;h'd for nothing more than to fight with her, becau&s;e he de&s;ired no|thing more than to lie with her.</HI> Now what &s;en&s;ible Meaning can this have, unle&s;s he takes her for a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian,</HI> who is to grow pa&s;|&s;ionately fond of him by the extraordinary Gallantry of a lu&s;ty Ba&s;tinado?

<Q><L>Boa&s;t not my Fall, (he cry'd) In&s;ulting Foe,</L>
<L>Thou by &s;ome others &s;halt be laid as low.</L></Q>
<P>Now we heard nothing before of the Baron's lying low. All that we heard is, that by a dextrous To&s;s of this <HI>mode&s;t Virgin,</HI> his No|&s;trils were fill'd with Snuff. So that he &s;eems here to &s;ay the &s;ame thing to her, that <HI>Nykin</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Cocky</HI> in the <HI>Old Batchelor</HI>; <HI>I have it in my Head, but you will have it in another Place.</HI> What follows &s;eems to be very ex|traordinary:</P>
<Q><L>Nor think to die dejects my lofty Mind,</L>
<L>All that I dread is leaving you behind:</L>
<L>Rather than &s;o, ah! let me &s;till &s;urvive,</L>

Now, Sir, who ever heard of a dead Man that burnt in <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Flames?</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame Nature are tho&s;e numerous Banters in Rhyme, which are to be found throughout this Poem, which are &s;o uniform, and &s;o much of a piece, that one would &s;wear the Author were giving a Receipt for dry Joking: For by placing &s;omething important in the Beginning of a Period, and making &s;omething very trifling follow it, he &s;eems to take pains to bring <HI>&s;omething</HI> into a Conjun|ction Copulative with <HI>nothing,</HI> in order to be|get <HI>nothing.</HI> Of this there are divers In&s;tances in <HI>Ariel</HI>'s Speech in the 2<HI>d Canto</HI>;</P>

<L>Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that <HI>Shock</HI> mu&s;t fall.</L></Q>
<P>Which, by the way, I &s;uppo&s;e is de&s;ign'd as a bitter Bob for the <HI>Prede&s;tinarians.</HI> Raillery apart, we pretend not to deny, that the very minute&s;t Events are foredoom'd by eternal Pre|&s;cience; but that Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould give notice of the Death of a vile Dog, by what he calls black Omens, is a great deal too &s;trong.

very Top of the human Creation, and the Fore|mo&s;t Man of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, give me leave to ask you one Que&s;tion: Is <HI>Ariel</HI> in Je&s;t or in Earne&s;t, in haranguing the Spirits at this rate? Is he in Earne&s;t? Why then even <HI>Robin Goodfellow</HI> him&s;elf is not a more &s;en&s;ele&s;s in&s;ignificant Hobgoblin. Is he in Je&s;t?

<P>Of the &s;ame Stamp and the &s;ame Contri|vance are the&s;e Lines in the Beginning of the 3<HI>d Canto</HI>:</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I am heartily tired with what I have already &s;ent you, and am really a&s;hamed of having pa&s;s'd a Week in thinking on &s;uch an empty jingling Trifle as the <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> a wretched Rhap&s;ody, writ for the Amu&s;ement of Boys, and Men like Boys; and tho' I am both very much indi&s;po&s;ed at pre&s;ent, and very bu&s;y, yet &s;ince I have re|ceived your Commands to &s;end you &s;ome Re|marks upon the <HI>Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> in that Bawble, in order to compleat the Conver&s;ion of Mrs. <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>; I will, in Obedience to tho&s;e Com|mands, do my&s;elf a little more Violence, and will do it in as &s;hort a Time, and as &s;mall a Compa&s;s as I can; for I will confine my&s;elf to the fir&s;t twelve Lines, that by the numerous Faults which will be &s;een in them, any one to whom you may happen to &s;hew this Letter, may be able to judge of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This Rhap&s;ody begins with Ab&s;urdity;</P>
<Q><L>What dire Offence from amorous Cau&s;es &s;prings,</L>
<L>What mighty Conte&s;ts ri&s;e from trivial things,</L>
<L>I &s;ing&mdash;This Ver&s;e to <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> Mu&s;e is due,</L>
<L>This ev'n <HI>Belinda</HI> may vouch&s;afe to view:</L>
<L>Slight is the Subject, but not &s;o the Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>If &s;he in&s;pire, and he approve my Lays.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="36" REF="71">
The two fir&s;t of the&s;e Lines, and the Begin|ning of the third, are out of all Grammatical Con&s;truction: For here the Verb Active <HI>&s;ing</HI> has no Accu&s;ative Ca&s;e depending on it; as the Nominative Ca&s;e is without a Verb in the Be|ginning of the Prologue to <HI>Cato,</HI> which Pro|logue was writ by the &s;ame little whim&s;ical Gentleman.</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Mu&s;e</HI> is a mere Expletive, and can have nothing to do here, &s;ince 'tis <HI>Belinda</HI> only that is to in&s;pire him.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than &s;ix Faults in the &s;ix Lines which he calls his Invocation:</P>
<Q><L>Say, what &s;trange Motive, Godde&s;s, cou'd compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t' a&s;&s;ault a gentle Belle?</L>
<L>O &s;ay, what &s;tranger Cau&s;e, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord.</L>
<L>And dwells &s;uch Rage in &s;ofte&s;t Bo&s;oms then?</L>
<L>And dwells &s;uch daring Souls in little Men?</L></Q>
<P>Now all this, if it were not for the Rhyme, would appear, even to Fools as well as to Men of Sen&s;e, the poore&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible Stuff that ever laid the gentle Reader a&s;leep. I would fain know what the Word <HI>Godde&s;s</HI> in the fir&s;t Line <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the Mu&s;e, or <HI>Belinda. Godde&s;s,</HI> by the u&s;ual Signification of the Word, relates to <HI>Mu&s;e,</HI> but according to Grammar and Con&s;truction, it relates to <HI>Belinda,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was mention'd la&s;t, and &s;he is the in&s;piring Per&s;on. The Word <HI>compel</HI> in the fir&s;t Line likewi&s;e is a Botch for the &s;ake of the Rhyme, the Word that &s;hould naturally have been u&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="72">
was either <HI>induce</HI> or <HI>provoke.</HI> The Word <HI>com|pel</HI> &s;uppo&s;es the Baron to be a Bea&s;t, and not a free Agent. Now, Sir, what a pretty Sen&s;e the&s;e two fir&s;t Lines make:</P>
<Q><L>Say, what &s;trange Motive, Godde&s;s, cou'd compel</L>
<L>A well-bred Lord t' a&s;&s;ault a gentle Belle?</L></Q>
<P>That is, what could <HI>force</HI> a <HI>well-bred</HI> Man to be damnably rude, and to &s;hew him&s;elf an er|rant Clown and a Brute? As for the Terms <HI>gentle Belle,</HI> they are too affected, too weak, and too low, and by no means come up to what is &s;aid to <HI>Belinda</HI> in the very next Page by <HI>Ariel</HI> the Sylph:</P>
<Q><L>Faire&s;t of Mortals, thou di&s;tingui&s;h'd Care</L>
<L>Of thou&s;and bright Inhabitants of Air.</L></Q>
<P>For <HI>Belle</HI> and <HI>Beau,</HI> as we have made them, as it were, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub&s;tantives, do not &s;ignify &s;o much as Beautiful, tho' as they are <HI>French</HI> Adjectives they have that Signification. No Man when he calls another <HI>Beau,</HI> means, that that other is hand&s;ome, but only that he takes a great deal of Poppi&s;h Care about his Dre&s;s, and gives him&s;elf a great many fanta&s;tick Airs, in order to plea&s;e &s;uperficial People, and ren|der him&s;elf ridiculous to Men of Sen&s;e. <HI>Belle</HI> has much the &s;ame Signification, and accord|ing to the pre&s;ent U&s;e and Acceptation of the Word, no more &s;ignifies a beautiful Woman than <HI>Coquette</HI> does, but only one that takes a great deal of fruitle&s;s Pains to make her&s;elf
<PB N="38" REF="73">
more agreeable than God and Nature have made her. But let us go on to the next Couplet:</P>
<Q><L>Oh &s;ay, what &s;tranger Cau&s;e, yet unexplor'd,</L>
<L>Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?</L></Q>
<P>The Cau&s;e was, becau&s;e &s;he did not like him; a &s;trange Cau&s;e indeed, and which required a great deal of Sagacity to find it out. But to what Purpo&s;e is the Word <HI>reject? Belinda</HI> granted him every thing that he ask'd of her. He de&s;ired to wait upon her to <HI>Hampton|Court,</HI> and &s;he granted it. He de&s;ired her to make one at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and &s;he complied with that Reque&s;t likewi&s;e. If &s;he granted no more, it was becau&s;e he ask'd no more: For, if we may believe her&s;elf, by what &s;he &s;ays at the Beginning of the <HI>fourth Canto,</HI> &s;he would have refu&s;ed him nothing unle&s;s it was her <HI>favou|rite Lock:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Oh had&s;t thou, cruel, been content to &s;eize</L>
<L>Hairs le&s;s in Sight, or any Hairs but the&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>For &s;he, who &s;eems inclin'd to &s;acrifice her Mo|de&s;ty to her Vanity, would, in all likelihood, have &s;acrificed it to her Plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, the Baron is &s;o far from making Love in this Rhap&s;ody, that he plainly &s;hews, by the rude Affront which he puts upon <HI>Belinda,</HI> that he expected no particular Favour from her. And indeed this Party of Plea&s;ure at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> &s;eems to me to look more like Catterwauling, than the Behaviour of Per&s;ons who went thither
<PB N="39" REF="74">
with any amorous De&s;ign. But let us proceed to the next Couplet:</P>
<Q><L>And dwells &s;uch Rage in &s;ofte&s;t Bo&s;oms then?</L></Q>
<P>Yes, mo&s;t certainly does it; and if this little Gentleman had not had a Head more &s;oft than <HI>Belinda</HI>'s Bo&s;om, he could never have been ca|pable of asking &s;o &s;imple a Que&s;tion. The &s;ofter Sex are much more &s;ubject to violent Pa&s;&s;ions than Men. <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;hewed a Softne&s;s in <HI>Dido,</HI> which this little Gentleman is utterly incapable of comprehending; a Softne&s;s which obliged a Sovereign Queen, who&s;e Under&s;tand|ing was equal to her Supreme Power, or to her Greatne&s;s of Mind, to grant the la&s;t Favour to the <HI>Trojan</HI> Hero, and yet that Softne&s;s was immediately &s;ucceeded by a Rage, to who&s;e Force, and who&s;e noble Enthu&s;ia&s;m, this little Creature, who is as diminutive an Author as he is an Animal, is as utterly incapable of rai|&s;ing him&s;elf, as an earthly Vapour is of a&s;cend|ing to Heaven. But tho' nothing is more plain than that <HI>Rage</HI> may dwell in <HI>&s;ofte&s;t Bo&s;oms,</HI> yet had it no more to do here than <HI>reject,</HI> and indeed had the le&s;s to do here becau&s;e of <HI>reject:</HI> For cannot a Lady deny a Gentleman who makes a civil Reque&s;t to her, but &s;he mu&s;t &s;all immediately into as raving a Fit, as &s;he could have done, if he had extorted the Favour from her. <HI>Reject</HI> &s;hews <HI>Contempt</HI> rather than <HI>Rage:</HI> It &s;hews that &s;he did not e&s;teem the Baron enough to be at all angry with him. But let us come to the &s;econd Line of the Couplet:</P>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="75">
<L>And dwells &s;uch daring Souls in little Men?</L></Q>
<P>Yes certainly, <HI>daring Souls</HI> dwell often in <HI>little Men,</HI> and for that very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are <HI>little Men.</HI> Did he never hear of what <HI>Statius</HI> &s;ays of little <HI>Tydeus:</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;toto&s;que infu&s;a per artus</L>
<L>Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus.</L></Q>
<P>I my&s;elf know a little Mon&s;ter, who, I dare venture to prophe&s;y, will one Day &s;hew as <HI>daring</HI> a Soul as a mad <HI>Indian</HI> who runs a muck. But what Occa&s;ion is there for <HI>daring Souls</HI> here? The Baron &s;hews a good deal of <HI>Bru|tality,</HI> and a good deal of <HI>Perfidy,</HI> but no <HI>Daring.</HI> He &s;hew'd a great deal of <HI>Courage</HI> indeed, in coming treacherou&s;ly behind a Lady and cutting off her favourite Lock!</P>
<P>But all this Piece, is, like <HI>Wind&s;or Fore&s;t,</HI> or the <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> below Critici&s;m; and there|fore I take my Leave of you. It would be un|rea&s;onable to expect that you &s;hould read Re|marks with Plea&s;ure which I write with Pain; Remarks which may be made by the mo&s;t ordi|nary Reader, without any Penetration or any Sagacity. Be&s;ides, I have given a &s;ufficient Sample to enable Mrs. <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> to judge of the re&s;t. For as a Lion is known by his Claws, an A&s;s is known by his Ears.</P>
