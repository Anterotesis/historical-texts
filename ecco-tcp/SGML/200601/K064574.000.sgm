<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN the following
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> was fini&s;h'd
and ready for the
<HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> I con&s;ider'd to
what <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> the <HI>Dedi|cation</HI>
of it would be mo&s;t accep|table;
(for I am re&s;olv'd that none
but <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> as yet &s;hall have the
Honour of my <HI>Dedications</HI>;) and
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
I had not long ponder'd upon the
Matter, before I hit upon your
<HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> who mu&s;t needs be pleas'd
with this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e of the
Advantage, that you, as well as
my&s;elf, in the End, will reap by it.</P>
<P>By Virtue of your <HI>Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip</HI>
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> you, <HI>My Lord,</HI> are a
<HI>Moderator</HI> at theological Di&s;puta|tions,
as I am here: And whether
the Execution of your Office be
as trouble&s;ome as mine is, I know
not: But if the De&s;ign of this
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> take Place, we &s;hall find
that modern Controver&s;ies about
Religion are all vain; and there|upon
be <HI>both</HI> of us &s;oon eas'd of
the Trouble of our <HI>Moderations</HI> at
them.</P>
<P>It may be, <HI>my Lord,</HI> you are not
&s;o weary of your <HI>Moderator&s;hip,</HI>
as I am: Be&s;ides, that you are
better paid for your Pains, your
Di&s;putants are more amicable, and
in the mid&s;t of their Di&s;putes more
<PB N="v" REF="4">
tractable: Tho they may warmly
contend, at the pre&s;ent, for and
again&s;t the Point in Debate; yet
like <HI>Lawyers</HI> who are no le&s;s zea|lous
for their <HI>Clients</HI> in the Day,
they commonly agree to drink a
Bottle together at Night, and go
to Bed, good Friends. And this
is very well done of them.</P>
<P>But my Di&s;putants, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
call'd <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> at who&s;e
Controver&s;y I have the Trouble,
by the Appointment of the Fathers,
to pre&s;ide, are more &s;tubborn, tur|bulent
and refractory. What ill
Treatment they would give each
other, if it was in their Power, I
know not: But my <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> &s;ince
they can't be aveng'd on their
Adver&s;arys, are full of Re&s;entment
again&s;t their <HI>Moderator,</HI> becau&s;e I
am not altogether partial to their
&s;ide; and how I &s;hall e&s;cape their
Indignation, God alone knows.</P>

<P>If your <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> upon reading

<HEAD>A SIXTH
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
<HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_HERE goes my &s;ixth and
la&s;t <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>Mi|racles</HI>;
the Subject whereof
is the literal Story of his
own Re&s;urrection; which,
according to the Propo&s;ition
in hand, I am to &s;how to con&s;i&s;t of Ab|&s;urditys,
Improbabilitys and Incredibilitys.
And I hope our <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> will quietly per|mit
the Publication of this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> e&s;|pecially
<PB N="2" REF="11">
if I a&s;&s;ure them, that I mean no|thing
wor&s;e by it, than to make way for
the Under&s;tanding, what the Fathers write
of, the my&s;tical Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> out
of the Grave of the Letter of the Law
and the Prophets;, of which my&s;tical Re|&s;urrection
of our <HI>&s;piritual Je&s;us,</HI> the
Evangelical Story of the Re&s;urrection of a
<HI>carnal Chri&s;t</HI> is but mere Type and Sha|dow.</P>
<P>I am &s;o far from de&s;igning any Service
to Infidelity by this <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> that I aim
at the Accompli&s;hment of &s;ome of St.
<HI>John</HI>'s Apocalyptical Vi&s;ions. The Fa|thers
&s;ay that a <HI>Church,</HI> built on the
Letter of the Scriptures, particularly on
the Letter of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles, is <HI>Babylon</HI>;
and that antiliteral Arguments and my&s;|tical
Interpretations will be the downfal
of her. Whether there is any Truth in
this Opinion of the Fathers, I am minded
to make the Experiment; and tho I &s;hould
bring the old Hou&s;e of the Church over
my Head, and be cru&s;h'd to Pieces in its
Ruins, I can't forbear it: But however,
I would advi&s;e the <HI>Clergy</HI> to make ha&s;te
and <HI>come out of Babylon,</HI> for fear of the
wor&s;t; or they, who upon the Authority
of the Fathers are <HI>the Merchants of Ba|bylon,</HI>
will <HI>weep</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Revelations Ch. xviii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>and mourn</HI> upon her
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Fall, becau&s;e <HI>none will buy their Mer|chandize</HI>
of the Letter <HI>any more.</HI> Dear
<HI>Je&s;u,</HI> that &s;uch a <HI>Student,</HI> as I am, in the
<HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> and an Inter|preter
of them too upon the Authority of
the Fathers &s;hould be charg'd with Bla&s;|phemy
and Infidelity!</P>
<P>So to Work I went; and I had not
been long mu&s;ing by my&s;elf, how to &s;ap
this Foundation of the Church, before I
was &s;en&s;ible of my own In&s;ufficiency for
it. Whereupon I &s;ent to my old Friend,
the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbi,</HI> for his Thoughts on this
grand Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection,
which he gave me &s;ome Promi&s;e of But
I de&s;ired him to forbear all Ludicrou&s;|ne&s;s,
Satire and Banter for fear of Offence:
For tho our <HI>Clergy</HI> liked Volumes of Je&s;ts
and Facetiou&s;ne&s;s, if they were di&s;charg'd
again&s;t <HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI>; yet
when they were levell'd at <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of
the <HI>Letter</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;e was alter'd,</HI> as quoth
<HI>Plowden,</HI> and they were not to be born
with. Therefore he was to remember
that decency, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and calmne&s;s of
Argument, required by the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
 <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">In his Pa&s;toral Letter, p. 35.</NOTE> or I dur&s;t not print it.</P>
<P>In Compliance with my De&s;ires he &s;ent
me the following Letter, which, having
<PB N="4" REF="13">
purg'd it of a few <HI>Puns</HI> and <HI>Cunundrums,</HI>
becau&s;e all Appearance of <HI>Wit,</HI> as of <HI>Evil,</HI>

and it runs thus.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your Reque&s;t, I here
&s;end you my Thoughts on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Re&s;urrection, in which I &s;hall be &s;horter
than I would be, becau&s;e of the cu&s;tomary
Bounds of your <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Controver&s;y between us <HI>Jews</HI> and
you <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> about the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> has hi|therto
been of a diffu&s;ive Nature: But
as the &s;ubject of <HI>this</HI> is the Re&s;urrection
of your <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; &s;o by my Con&s;ent, we'll
now reduce the Controver&s;y to a narrow
Compa&s;s, and let it turn entirely on this
grand Miracle and Article of your Faith.
If your <HI>Divines</HI> can prove <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;ur|rection
again&s;t the following Objections,
then I will acknowledge him to be the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iab,</HI> and will turn Chti&s;tian, other|wi&s;e
he mu&s;t &s;till pa&s;s with us for an
Impo&s;tor and fal&s;e Prophet.</P>
<P>I have often lamented the Lo&s;s of &s;uch
Writings, which our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> unquestio|nably
di&s;pers'd again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e of
the cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ar fight they would give us, into
the Cheat and Impo&s;ture of his Religion.
<PB N="5" REF="14">
But I rejoice and thank God, there is lit|tle
or no want of them, to the Point in
Hand. For I had not long meditated on
the Story of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, as your
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> have related it, but I plainly
di&s;cern'd it to be the mo&s;t notorious and
mon&s;trous Impo&s;ture, that ever was put
upon Mankind. And if you plea&s;e to at|tend
to my following Arguments, which
require no depth of Judgment and Capa|city
to apprehend, I am per&s;uaded that you
and every one di&s;intere&s;ted, will be of the
&s;ame Mind too.</P>
<P>To overthrow and confute the Story of
this mon&s;trous and incredible Miracle, I was
thinking once to premi&s;e an Argument of the
Ju&s;tice of the Sentence denounc'd again&s;t
and executed upon <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who was &s;o far
from being the innocent Per&s;on, you Chri&s;|tians
would make of him, that, as may ea|&s;ily
be proved, he was &s;o grand a <HI>Deceiver,</HI>
<HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Malefactor,</HI> as no Puni&s;h|ment
could be too great for him. But
this Argument (which I re&s;erve again&s;t
a Day of perfect Liberty, to publi&s;h by
it&s;elf in Defence of the Honour and Ju&s;|tice
of our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI>) would be too long
for the Compa&s;s of this Letter; and
therefore I pa&s;s it by, tho it would give
Force to my following Objections; it be|ing
hard and even impo&s;&s;ible to imagine,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
that God would vouch&s;afe the Favour of
a miraculous Re&s;urrection to one, who for
his Crimes de&s;ervedly &s;uffer'd and under|went
Death.</P>
<P>But waveing, I &s;ay, that Argument for
the pre&s;ent, which of it&s;elf would be
enough to prejudice a rea&s;onable Man
again&s;t the Belief of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection;
I will allow <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to have been a much
better Man, than I believe him to have
been; or as good a one in Morals as your
Divines do &s;uppo&s;e him; and will only
con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances of the Evange|lical
Story of his Re&s;urrection; from
which, if I don't prove it to have been the
mo&s;t bare-fac'd Impo&s;ture that ever was
put upon the World, I de&s;erve for the Va|nity
of this Attempt a much wor&s;e Pu|ni&s;hment
than he for his Frauds endu|red.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes wonder'd, con&s;idering
the Nature and Heinou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Faults, for which he dy'd, that our <HI>Chief
Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> had any regard to his
Prediction (which was &s;o like a Bambou|zlement
of the Populace) that he was to ri&s;e
again the <HI>third Day</HI> after his Crucifixion.
There's no other Nation in the World,
which would not have &s;lighted &s;uch a vain
Progno&s;tication of a known Impo&s;tor.
Let him foretel with ever &s;o much Con|fidence
<PB N="7" REF="16">
his &s;peedy return to Life, I dare
&s;ay, any other Magi&s;trates of ordinary Pru|dence
would have de&s;pi&s;ed him for a pre|&s;umptuous
<HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI>: But, when I reflec|ted
on the Impo&s;ture of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;ur|rection,
and of what pernicious Con&s;e|quence
it had like to have proved to the
Peace and Welfare of our Nation, if it
had not been happily di&s;cover'd, my
Wonder here ceas'd; and I as much ad|mire
now the Wi&s;dom, Caution and
Circum&s;pection of our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> again&s;t
all po&s;&s;ible Fraud and Deceit in the fore|told
Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Tho <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
him&s;elf, the Head of the Confederacy, and
prime Projector of the de&s;ign'd Cheat in
the Ca&s;e of <HI>Lazarus</HI> was cut off, yet his
A&s;&s;ociates were &s;till numerous; and it was
not impo&s;&s;ible, but they might concert a
Project of a counterfeited Re&s;urrection of
him, in Accompli&s;hment of his Prophecy,
that might be of more fatal Con&s;equence,
and tend to &s;uch Confu&s;ions and Di&s;trac|tions
among the People, as would not be
&s;oon quell'd and quieted. Whereupon our
<HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> very prudently con&s;ider of
Precautions again&s;t Cheat here, and wi&s;ely
make Application to <HI>Pilat</HI> the <HI>Governor,</HI>
that proper and effectual Mea&s;ures may be
taken again&s;t a fal&s;e and feign'd Re&s;urrec|tion,
for Fear of the ill Effects of it.
<PB N="8" REF="17">
And one of them, as the <HI>Spoke&s;man</HI> of
their Company, &s;eems, according to <HI>Mat|thew,</HI>
Ch. xxvii. to have made the Speech
following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> We remember that this De|ceiver
and Impo&s;tor <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who was
ye&s;terday crucified and ju&s;tly &s;uffer'd
Death for his Bla&s;phemy and many De|lu&s;ions
of the People (that were of bad
Con&s;equence, and might have been of
much wor&s;e, if he had not been timely
brought to condign Puni&s;hment) &s;aid
repeatedly before, that notwith&s;tanding
the Death he was to undergo, he &s;hould
ri&s;e again to Life the <HI>third Day</HI> after.
It is not that we are at all apprehen&s;ive
of &s;uch a wonderful and miraculous
Event, which knowing him to have
been a fal&s;e Prophet as well as a de|ceitful
Juggler, we have no Fears nor
Belief of. But as it is not long &s;ince,
that the Inhabitants in and about <HI>Be|thany</HI>
had like to have been fatally de|luded
and impo&s;ed on by him, in the
pretended Re&s;u&s;citation of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> one
of his Di&s;ciples and Confederates in Ini|quity;
&s;o it is not altogether impo&s;&s;ible
nor improbable bat his Di&s;ciples and
Accomplices, who are many, may pro|ject
a feign'd Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> (in
<PB N="9" REF="18">
Accompli&s;hment of his Prediction) by
&s;tealing his Body away, and pretend|ing
he is ri&s;en from the dead. Should
&s;uch a Sham-Miracle be contrived a|mong&s;t
them and cunningly executed it
would be <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word"> (<HI>not an Error but</HI>) an
Impo&s;ture of wor&s;e Con&s;equence to our
Nation and Religion, than the former
in <HI>Lazarus</HI> could have been, if it had
never been detected: We crave there|fore
the Favour of your <HI>Excellency,</HI> to
give Command for the making his Se|pulchre
&s;ure, till the <HI>third Day</HI> is pa&s;t,
that neither his <HI>dead</HI> Body may be ta|ken
away, and a Re&s;urrection pretend|ed;
nor a <HI>living</HI> one &s;lipt into its Place,
and a Miracle counterfeited on that Day,
when we will be pre&s;ent at the opening
of the Sepulchre, and give Satisfaction
to the People of his being a fal&s;e Pro|phet.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Whether <HI>Pilat</HI> was at all intent on the
Prevention of Fraud in this Ca&s;e, or would
not willingly have connived at it, to in|crea&s;e
the Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions of our
then unhappy Nation, may be que&s;tion'd:
But the Reque&s;t of our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> was
&s;o rea&s;onable, and their Importunitys &s;o
urgent, that he could not re&s;i&s;t them; and
therefore order'd them a <HI>Watch</HI> for the
<PB N="10" REF="19">
Sepulchre, which they might make as
&s;ure, as they could, again&s;t Fraud and
Impo&s;ture, till the <HI>third Day.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> deliberate,
what mea&s;ures were fitte&s;t to be taken to
this Purpo&s;e. And as I can't, and don't
believe any Man el&s;e can, devi&s;e any bet|ter
for the &s;ecurity of the Sepulchre a|gain&s;t
Fraud, than what they took; &s;o I
admire and applaud their Prudence, Cir|cum&s;pection,
and Precaution in the Ca&s;e.
They <HI>&s;eal'd the Stone</HI> at the mouth of the
Sepulchre, and placed a Guard of Sol|diers
about it; which were <HI>Two</HI> &s;uch cer|tain
means for the Prevention or Detec|tion
of Cheat in a Re&s;urrection, as are
not to be equall'd by any other.</P>
<P>They <HI>&s;eal'd the Stone</HI> of the Sepulchre,
which, tho it was no Security at all a|gain&s;t
Violence, yet was an ab&s;olute one
again&s;t Fraud. How the <HI>Stone</HI> which fit|ted
the Mouth of the Sepulchre, as a Door
do's the Entrance into a Room, was &s;eal'd,
I need not de&s;cribe. The u&s;e and man|ner
of &s;ealing of Doors of Clo&s;ets, of
Che&s;ts, and of Papers is common; and
as it is an obvious Expedient, for the
Satisfaction of the Signators, again&s;t De|ceit;
&s;o it has been an antient as well as
a modern Practice. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Daniel. Cap. vi. 17.</NOTE>
<PB N="11" REF="20">
&s;eal'd the Door of the Den of Lions
wherein <HI>Daniel</HI> was ca&s;t, with his own
Signet: And wherefore did He &s;o? For
the Satisfaction of him&s;elf and of his Cour|tiers,
when he came again to open and
compare the Signature with his Signet,
that no Art nor Artifice hid been u&s;ed for
the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Daniel.</HI> So our <HI>Chief
Prie&s;ts</HI> &s;eal'd the Stone of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Sepul|chre,
which they de&s;ign'd to be pre&s;ent at
the opening of, on the <HI>third Day,</HI> the
Time appointed by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for his Re&s;ur|rection,
and then give ample Satisfaction
to the People, that there was a real or
could be no Re&s;urrection of his Body.
Wherefore el&s;e did they <HI>&s;eal</HI> the Stone of
his Sepulchre?</P>
<P>Your <HI>Grotius</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Adducor ut credam Pilati Annulo et hunc Lapi|dem &s;ignatum. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE> thinks, that <HI>Pilat</HI>'s
Seal was affix'd to the Stone of the Sepul|chre;
but, as I believe, <HI>Pilat</HI> little con|cern'd
him&s;elf about the Prevention of De|ceit
here; &s;o I much que&s;tion it. It is
more rea&s;onable to think that the <HI>Chief
Prie&s;ts</HI> and other Civil Magi&s;trates of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI>
with their &s;everal Seals, which
could not be open'd but by them&s;elves
without &s;u&s;picion of Fraud, &s;ign'd the
<PB N="12" REF="21">
Stone, and intended to be pre&s;ent, on the
Day appointed, at the opening of the
Sepulchre; not doubting, what no body
could que&s;tion, but <HI>Je&s;us</HI> would wait their
coming, and ari&s;e to Life if he could, in
the &s;ight of them&s;elves, and of a va&s;t Con|cour&s;e
of People, that were &s;ure to at|tend
on them to behold the Miracle. Such
a Re&s;urrection would have been of Sati&s;|faction
to the whole Nation; and &s;uch a
Re&s;urrection, rea&s;onably &s;peaking, <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
would, if he could, have vouch&s;afed in
Accommodation to the <HI>&s;ealing</HI> of the
<HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this Precaution,
in &s;ealing of the Stone, the be&s;t that could
be taken again&s;t Fraud, <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Body
was privately &s;lipt off, early in the Morn|ing
of the Day before, and a Re&s;urrection
pretended by his Di&s;ciples; and you
would have us and our Ance&s;tors to be|lieve,
there was no Deceit in the Ca&s;e;
tho confe&s;&s;edly none of the <HI>Sealers</HI> of
the Sepulchre were pre&s;ent: Who can
believe it? Was or can there be any
Impo&s;ture more again&s;t: Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on
palm'd upon the Under&s;tandings of Man|kind?
If there had been a real Re&s;urrecti|on,
the <HI>Sealers</HI> of the <HI>Stone</HI> would have
<PB N="13" REF="22">
been the <HI>Openers</HI> of the Sepulchre; where|fore
el&s;e was the <HI>Stone &s;eal'd</HI>?</P>
<P>A Que&s;tion, that here ari&s;es, is, On
what Day and what Time of the Day,
did our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts,</HI> the Sealers of the
Stone, expect, what they could not think
would ever come to pa&s;s, <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;ur|rection?
Or what was the Extent of the
Time meant by <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> when he &s;aid that
after <HI>three Days,</HI> or on the <HI>third Day</HI> after
his Pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould ri&s;e again? if any
Impo&s;tor or Prophet like <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould in
this Age &s;o predict his Re&s;urrection, and
be executed on a <HI>Fryday,</HI> the Day for his
Re&s;urrection would be pre&s;umed to be
<HI>Monday,</HI> and not <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning before
Day. And I humbly conceive former
Ages and Nations, and our Nation in
particular did compute after this Fa&s;hion.
Accordingly on <HI>Monday</HI> our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts,</HI>
I don't doubt, intended to be pre&s;ent at
the opening of the Seals of the Sepulchre,
and to behold the Miracle: But <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Body was clande&s;tinely moved off early
on <HI>Sunday,</HI> (the Day before <HI>that</HI> &s;ignified
and predicted for his Re&s;urrection) to the
Laughter more than to the &s;urprize of our
Ance&s;tors, at the Notoriety of the Fraud
committed, and at the Vanity of a Re|&s;urrection
pretended upon it. And I may
<PB N="14" REF="23">
appeal, even to your <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> of the
Church, whether here's not another Note
of Cheat and Impo&s;ture; and whether
the Di&s;ciples were not afraid to tru&s;t <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>'s
Body, it's full time, in the Grave;
becau&s;e of the greater Difficulty to carry
it off afterwards, and pretend a Re&s;ur|rection
upon it.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e your <HI>Divines</HI> (who have
&s;ingular Knacks at making two Nights and
a full Day, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was buried, to be
<HI>three Days</HI> and <HI>three Nights</HI>; and who&s;e
various Ways of Computation I always &s;mile
at) do a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Sunday</HI> was the <HI>third Day,</HI>
on which, in Accompli&s;hment of <HI>Jonah</HI>'s
Prophecy, and of his own Prediction, he
was to ri&s;e again; I will &s;uppo&s;e &s;o with
them, and will, if they plea&s;e, grant that
our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Sealers</HI> of the Sepul|chre,
expected his Re&s;urrection on that Day,
and intended, for the opening of the Seals,
to be pre&s;ent at it.</P>
<P>But at what Time of Day were they
to come or could be expected at the Se|pulchre?
Not long before Noon. But
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Body was gone betimes in the
Morning, before our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> could
be out of their Beds; and a barefaced In|fringment
of the Seals of the Sepulchre was
made again&s;t the Laws of Honour and
<PB N="15" REF="24">
Hone&s;ty, and a Re&s;urrection confidently
talk'd of by the Di&s;ciples; and yet your
Chri&s;tian Prie&s;thood at this Day would
have us to believe, there was no Fraud
and Deceit in all this! O mo&s;t mon|&s;trous!</P>
<P>If our <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI> had tre&s;pa&s;s'd upon
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Patience, and would not attend at
the Sepulchre for the opening of the Seals,
on the Day and Time appointed; if they
hid been for confining him longer in the
Grave than was meet, according to Pro|phecy,
then his Re&s;urrection, without their
Pre&s;ence, had been excu&s;able and ju&s;tifiable.
But this his pretended Ri&s;ing to Life,
not only a Day before the Chief Prie&s;ts
could imagine he would, or earlier in the
Morning than he &s;hould, for the Sake of
their requi&s;ite Pre&s;ence, is, together with
the Fracture of the Seals again&s;t the Law
of Security, &s;uch a manife&s;t and indi&s;pu|table
Mark and Indication of Fraud, as is
not to be equall'd in all or any of the
Impo&s;tures, that ever were attempted to be
put upon the World.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by the Sealing of the Stone
of the Sepulchre we are to under&s;tand
nothing le&s;s than a Covenant enterd into,
between our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI>
by which <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Veracity, Power and
<PB N="16" REF="25">
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI> was to be try'd. Tho we read
not of the Apo&s;tles giving their Con&s;ent to
the Covenant, yet it was rea&s;onably pre|&s;um'd
and could not have been refus'd, if
ask'd. The Condition of the &s;eal'd Cove|nant
was, that if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> aro&s;e from the dead
in the Pre&s;ence of our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> upon
their opening the Seals of the Sepulchre,
at the Time appointed; then was he to be
acknowledg'd to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>: But if he
continued in a corrupt and putrified &s;tate
of Mortality, then was he to be granted
to be an <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI>: Very wi&s;ely and right|ly
agreed! And if the Apo&s;tles had &s;tood
to this Covenant, Chri&s;tianity had been
nipt in its Bud, and &s;uppre&s;s'd in its Birth.
But they had other Views and another
Game to play at all Adventures. The
Body was to be removed and a Re&s;ur|rection
pretended to the Delu&s;ion, it po&s;|&s;ibe,
of all Mankind, in which they have
been more &s;ucce&s;sful than could be imagin'd
upon a Project that had &s;o little Sen&s;e or
Rea&s;on, &s;o little Colour of Truth or Arti|fice
in the Contrivance and Execution of
it. Our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> were apprehen&s;ive
at fir&s;t of their &s;tealing the Body away,
and pretending a Re&s;urrection: Bat af|ter
the <HI>&s;ealing</HI> of the <HI>Stone,</HI> tho&s;e fears
vani&s;h'd; becau&s;e upon the &s;tealing the
<PB N="17" REF="26">
Body, away again&s;t &s;uch &s;ecurity and Pre|caution,
the Fraud would be felf evident,
and want no Demon&s;tration and Proof of
it. Bur, for all this Precaution, I &s;ay, the
Body was in a barefaced Manner taken
away, a Re&s;urrection talk'd of, and to the
Amazement of every one, who can think
freely, has been beleived thro' all Ages
of the Church &s;ince. Upon the whole
then, I think, you may as well &s;ay, when
a &s;eal'd Clo&s;et is broken open, and the
Trea&s;ure gone without the Privity of the
Signators, that there's no wrong done; as
that in the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> there
was no Fraud. The Ca&s;es are equal and
parallel. What then can your Chri&s;tian,
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> &s;ay to this demon&s;trative Argu|ment
of a manife&s;t and bare-faced Cheat
in <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection? I have been
thinking, what they will or can &s;ay;
and upon the mature&s;t Consideration I
don't find they can make any other than
one or more of the&s;e &s;huffling An&s;wers to
it, <HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Di&s;|ciples
to Steal the Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> away,
becau&s;e of the Watchfulne&s;s of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Re&s;urrec|tion,
tho the <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI>
of Sepulchre were not pre&s;ent at it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="18" REF="27">2. That tho the <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Seal|ers</HI>
of the &s;tone of the Sepulchre were
not pre&s;enr, as I &s;ay they ought to
have been, to behold the Miracle; yet
his Re&s;urrection was afterwards made as
manife&s;t to them, as if they had been
there pre&s;ent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did not really ari&s;e
from the dead, the Beleif of his Re&s;ur|rection
could never have been &s;o propaga|ted
at fir&s;t, nor would have been retain'd
in the World for &s;o many Ages &s;ince.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I can think of no other An&s;wers, and
believe it impo&s;&s;ible for your Chri&s;tian
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to form any other, to the fore|&s;aid
Argument of Fraud in <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re|&s;urrection:
But how weak, frivolous and
in&s;ufficient they all and every one are,
will appear upon a little Examination in|to
them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, again&s;t the fore&s;aid demon|&s;trative
Argument of Fraud, it may be
pretended, <HI>That it was impo&s;&s;ible for the
Di&s;ciples to &s;teal the Body of</HI> Je&s;us <HI>away,
becau&s;e of the Watchfulne&s;s of the Guards;
and therefore there was a real Re&s;urrec|tion,
tho the</HI> Cheif Prie&s;ts, <HI>the</HI> Sealers <HI>of
the Sepulchre were not pre&s;ent at it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="28">
To which I reply, and confe&s;s, that if
it was impo&s;&s;ible to evade the Guards of
the Sepulchre, then there was a real Re&s;ur|rection;
but if there was but a bare Po&s;|&s;ibility
of evading them, then this An&s;wer
is of no Force. And I am of Opinion,
that the Thing was not only po&s;&s;ible,
but ea&s;y, fea&s;&s;ible, and practicable. Tho
the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers were of as much Fi|delity
and Integrity as any of their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion;
yet it is well known, that &s;uch
Creatures are &s;ubject to Bribery and Cor|ruption,
if the Di&s;ciples had any Money
to tempt them with: Or if their Faith|fulne&s;s
to their Tru&s;t was untainted;
yet it is not improbable, but their Offi|cers,
at the Direction of <HI>Pilat,</HI> who found
his Account in the Di&s;tractions of our
Nation, might give them the Hint to wink
hard, at the Commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Fraud.
But not to in&s;i&s;t on either of the&s;e Ways
to evade the <HI>Watch</HI>; our Ance&s;tors &s;aid,
what your <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> has recorded, that
the Di&s;ciples, taking the opportunity
of the &s;leep of the Guards, carry'd the
Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> off; which was a thing
both po&s;&s;ible and probable.</P>
<P>Of what Number the <HI>Watch</HI> did con&s;i&s;t
is uncertain. Your <HI>Whitly</HI> <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Upon the Place in <HI>Matthew.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays they
<PB N="20" REF="29">
were <HI>&s;ixty</HI>; but he has no Rea&s;on nor Au|thority
to think, they were &s;o many. If
they had been to be a Guard again&s;t Vio|lence,
I &s;hould ea&s;ily have believed they
were more; but in as much as they were
only a <HI>Watch</HI> again&s;t Fraud, and again&s;t any
ca&s;ual defaceing of the <HI>Seals</HI> on the Stone,
before the <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> came to open the
Sepulchre, <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Soldiers were
&s;ufficient, and I don't think, there were
any more &s;et to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not then at all improbable, that &s;o
few Soldiers &s;hould be fa&s;t a&s;leep at that
time of Night, or &s;o early in the Morn|ing,
when the clande&s;tine Work was done;
e&s;pecially after keeping &s;uch a <HI>Gaudy day,</HI>
as was the Fea&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;over, which,
like the Fe&s;tivals of other Nations, was
celebrated with Exce&s;s. Foot Soldiers
then, you may be &s;ure, upon the Bounty
of one or other did no more want, than
they would &s;cruple to take their <HI>Fill,</HI>
which like an Opiat lock'd up their Sen&s;es
for that Night, when the Di&s;ciples, be|ing
aware of the lucky opportunity, car|ry'd
the Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> off &s;afely.</P>
<P>And where's the Ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e,
that the Di&s;ciples them&s;elves might con|trive
the Intoxication of the Guards?
<HI>Herodotus</HI> tells us a Story of a dead-Body's
<PB N="21" REF="30">
being &s;tolen away by &s;uch an
Artifice. And I don't think the Di&s;ci|ples
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> either &s;o fooli&s;h or con|&s;cientious
as not to take the Hint and
enterpri&s;e the like Fraud. <HI>Peter,</HI> who
upon occa&s;ion, could <HI>&s;wear</HI> and <HI>cur&s;e</HI>
like a <HI>Trooper,</HI> would hardly &s;cruple to
fuddle a few <HI>Foot-Soldiers.</HI> But which
way &s;oever it came to pa&s;s, the
Watch were a&s;leep, which is neither hard
to conceive nor believe; and then the
Di&s;ciples executed <HI>that</HI> Fraud, which has
been the Delu&s;ion of Nations and Ages
&s;ince.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> would hint that the
<HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> gave Money to the Soldiers
to &s;ay, they were a&s;leep, when the Di&s;|ciples
&s;tole the Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> away,
as if they were brib'd to a fal&s;e Te&s;ti|mony;
but there neither was nor could
be any &s;uch Thing. If there had been a
real Re&s;urrection to their A&s;toni&s;hment
and Amazement, as it is repre&s;ented in
your Go&s;pels, no Money could &s;o &s;oon
have corrupted them to a fal&s;e Witne&s;s,
being under &s;uch Fears of God and of
<HI>Je&s;us.</HI> I don't doubt but our <HI>Cheif
Prie&s;ts</HI> might reward the Soldiers for &s;peak|ing
the Truth, and exhort them to per|&s;i&s;t
in it, with a Promi&s;e to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> them
<PB N="22" REF="31">
again&s;t the Anger of <HI>Pilat</HI> for their &s;leep|ing
and neglect of their Duty.</P>
<P>Here then is no <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the fore&s;aid
Argument or Objection again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Re&s;urrection. It was not at all impo&s;&s;ible
for the Di&s;ciples, who &s;tole the Body
away, to avoid the Guards, who were
and may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be
lull'd a&s;leep, when the Di&s;ciples did it.
Neither is there any more Force in the</P>
<P N="2">2. Second An&s;wer to it, <HI>viz. That
tho the Cheif Prie&s;ts, the &s;ealers of the
Stone of ths Sepulchre, were not pre&s;ent,
opening the Seals and beholding the Mi|racle;
yet his Re&s;urrection was after|wards
as manife&s;t to them, as if they
had been there pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, this is &s;omewhat like an An&s;wer, if
there be any Truth in it. A Manife&s;tation
of <HI>Chri&s;t ri&s;en</HI> afterwards to our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI>
would have been equivalent to their Pre|&s;ence
at, and &s;ight of the Miracle. But
how was his Re&s;urrection manife&s;ted to
them? did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ever afterwards appear
per&s;onally to them, to their &s;atisfaction,
that he was the &s;ame Per&s;on, whom they
crucified and put to Death for a Deceiver
and fal&s;e Prophet? No; this is not once
a&s;&s;erted by your <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> or ever in&s;i|nuated
by any antient or modern Writer.
How then was <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection made
<PB N="23" REF="32">
manife&s;t to our Cheif Prie&s;ts? Why; your
<HI>Divines</HI> &s;ay, what is all that can be &s;aid
here, that the Words of the Di&s;ciples, who,
being Men of Hone&s;ty, Simplicity and In|tegrity,
would not Lye, are to be taken
for it. Very fine indeed! our Cheif Prie&s;ts
are to take the Words of the Di&s;ciples for
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, and look upon them
as Men of Veracity, when they knew and
experienc'd them to be grand Cheats, not
only in Stealing the Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> away,
but in the <HI>known Impo&s;ture</HI> of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s
Re&s;urrection, or your <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> had never
implicitly called it &s;o. When therefore
Deceivers will not be <HI>Lyers</HI>; nor Theives,
<HI>Di&s;&s;emblers</HI> of the Fact, they are accu&s;ed of,
I will own <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection to have
been manife&s;t enough to our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts.</HI>
There's no Need of more Argument here;
He that be&s;tows more Words on it, lo&s;es
Time.</P>
<P>It has been a Con&s;tant Objection of us
<HI>Jews</HI> again&s;t the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
that he appear'd not per&s;onally afterwards
to our <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts,</HI> to <HI>Pilat</HI> and to others
his Crucifiers and In&s;ultors, to upbraid
them with their Infidelity and ill Treat|ment
of him. Whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> would not
have done &s;o, if he really aro&s;e from the
dead; and whether he ought not in Rea|&s;on,
for the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of
<PB N="24" REF="33">
Unbeleivers, to have done &s;o, with me is
no Que&s;tion. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> of old <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Si Je&s;us volebat revera declarare &s;uam divinam Potentiam, debuerat &s;uis In&s;ultatoribus, ip&s;i&abque; Prae&s;idi qui capitalem &s;ententiam contra &s;e tulerat, denique cae|teris omnibus &s;e o&s;tendere. <HI>In Orig.

owns to be a con&s;iderable one, to the
Meditation of your modern Advocates for
Chri&s;tianity; and when they can prove,
that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> after his Re&s;urrection did per|&s;onally
appear to his Crucifiers, the <HI>Cheif</HI>

their Confutation; or that, according

have appeared to them, then I will turn
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and grant that in the Argu|ment
above, which proves plain Fraud
in the Re&s;urrection, there's no Force nor
Truth. In the mean time <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Non-Appearance
to the <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> is a Con|firmation,
that he did not ari&s;e from the
Dead, bat that his Body was &s;tolen away,
or he would have waited in the Grave,
the coming of the Sealers of the Stone,
and their regular opening of the Sepul|chre,

<P N="3">3. A third An&s;wer to the fore&s;aid Ar|gument

Here's as little Rea&s;on in this An&s;wer
as in either of the two former. Who

common Things among Chri&s;tians; and as
the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is their grand
and fundamental one, &s;o it is not at all
difficult to account for the Ri&s;e, Propa|gation
and Continuance of the Belief of
it.</P>
<P>Why it has been believed thro' the&s;e
latter Ages of the Church, is no Wonder
at all. The Prie&s;ts had their Intere&s;t in
it; the ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious had
their Comfort in it; and the wi&s;e and

not enquire into the Grounds of it.</P>
<P>The only difficulty here is to know,
upon what Principle, the Project and
Story of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection was at fir&s;t
devi&s;ed. And whether it was Ambition
or Revenge upon our ancient and phari|&s;aical
Prie&s;thood, that prompted the Apo|&s;tles
to it, is all one to me. Such bad
<PB N="27" REF="36">
Principles too often put Men upon de&s;|perate
Attempts. But however, an Im|po&s;ture
it was, for the Argument above.
To &s;ay, the Apo&s;tles and Confederates
in the Fraud would not have &s;tood to it,
and have dy'd for it, if the Re&s;urrec|tion
had not been real Fact, &s;ignifies
nothing. Many Cheats and Criminals,
be&s;ides them, have a&s;&s;erted their Inno|cency,
and deny'd their Guilt in the ut|mo&s;t
exrremity of Death, without the like
Views of Honour and Fame. The only
Thing, that's &s;urpri&s;ing and a&s;toni&s;hing
in this Sham-Miracle, is that, tho it
was the mo&s;t manife&s;t, the mo&s;t bare|faced,
and the mo&s;t &s;elf evident Impo&s;ture
that ever was put upon the World; yet
it has been the mo&s;t fortunate and &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
having pa&s;t thro' many Ages and
Nations with Reputation and Renown;
and might have continued for as many
Generations to come, but for the Argu|ment
above, that perfectly and clearly o|verthrows
its Credit.</P>
<P>But, &s;ome may &s;ay here, where was
the Wi&s;dom and Providence of God, all
this while, to &s;uffer &s;o many Ages and
Nations to labour under &s;uch a Delu|&s;ion?
Why, I'll tell you; The Provi|dence
of God in it was, "To humble

I am not at all obliged to refute
them. If the&s;e Appearances had been
more frequent, better circum&s;tanced, and
more &s;olemnly averr'd, they would have
wanted no Confutation. There's no doubt

<P>I have not here Room to make any Re|marks

<P>In the mean time I depend on the
foregoing &s;ingle, &s;ober and &s;edate Argu|ment
of Fraud in this grand Miracle,
which I found on the Nature and De|&s;ign
of &s;ealing the Sepulchre; and for
Confirmation of my Opinion and Proof
of Fraud in it, will conclude this Letter
with a parallel Ca&s;e and Story, Not
many Years &s;ince, one Dr. <HI>Emms,</HI> of the
Society of the French Prophets, who in
their In&s;pirations were, like <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his
Di&s;ciples of old, Declaimers again&s;t the
Phari&s;aical Prie&s;thood of this Age, did by
him&s;elf, or &s;ome of his Fraternity did for
him, predict his Re&s;urrection on a certain
Day, when there was a Concour&s;e of Peo|ple
about his Grave in vain to behold
the Miracle, as there would have been a|bout
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Sepulchre, if he had lain
in it, his full Time. But &s;uppo&s;ing in
this Ca&s;e, that the Magi&s;trates and Prie&s;t|hood
of this City, to prevent a Cheat and
Delu&s;ion of the People, had interred the
<PB N="33" REF="42">
<HI>Doctor</HI> in a Chnrch-Vault, and &s;eal'd the
Door of it again&s;t the Day appointed for
his Re&s;urrection, commanding a <HI>Night-Watch</HI>
to look to the Vault the no Vio|lence
or Deceit be u&s;ed: This would
have been a wi&s;e Precaution again&s;t Fraud,
as was in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> But what
if his Fraternity, having a Mind, like <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>'s
Di&s;ciples to bambouzle the People
and Prie&s;thood, had, &s;ome of them drawn
the Watch a&s;ide to a <HI>Gin-&s;hop,</HI> whil&s;t o|thers
carry'd the Body off, pretending a
Re&s;urrection? What would all rea&s;onable
Men have &s;aid here? That it was an
impudent and bare-faced Impo&s;ture. But
to carry on the Farce; &s;uppo&s;ing, the
<HI>Doctor</HI>'s Fraternity had afterwards averr'd
that they had &s;een and convers'd with him
alive, &s;everal Times, as before his Death;
and had told particular Storys of their
Conver&s;ation with him; as <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of all,
how he appear'd to &s;ome of their Women
(who were admoni&s;h'd of the Certainty of
his Re&s;urrection by a Youth or an An|gel
or two, they could not tell whether,
but they were as like to Angels, which
they never &s;aw before in their Lives, as
Youths could be) who knew him, not by
his Countenance, for <HI>their Eyes were holden,</HI>
as by his Talk on Scripture-Prophecy,
which was his u&s;ual Cant before his
<PB N="34" REF="43">
Death. And at another Time he appear'd
to his old Acquaintance, who knew him,
not by the Features of his Face, but by
an habitual Motion and Action of his
Hand in <HI>breaking of Bread.</HI> And at ano|ther
Time he was corporally pre&s;ent, but
<HI>they thought, they &s;aw a Spirit.</HI> About
<HI>eight Days after that,</HI> he appear'd among
more of his old Friends, but for all their
former Intimacy with him, &s;ome of them
<HI>doubted</HI> whether it was the <HI>Doctor</HI> or
not. At another Time he came to them
in <HI>another Form</HI> and Shape, unlike to his
pri&s;tin one, but they were &s;ure it was <HI>He</HI>
by his Expo&s;ition of the Scripture. At
another Time, when they were a&s;&s;embled
together and the Doors were lock'd <HI>for
fear of the Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> &s;lipt unex|pectedly
into their Company, either from
behind a Curtain, or miraculou&s;ly en|ter'd
at the Key-hold. And the la&s;t Time
he appear'd, there was one of his intimate
Friends had not known him, but by a
<HI>Sore</HI> in his Brea&s;t, which the Power of
God in his Re&s;urrection did not heal:
After which, they &s;aid, he <HI>vani&s;h'd away,</HI>
<HI>was taken up into Heaven,</HI> and they &s;aw
him no more. Suppo&s;ing, I &s;ay, the
<HI>French</HI> Prophets had told &s;uch like Sto|rys
of <HI>Doctor Emms</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, and
of his Appearances to them; what would
<PB N="35" REF="44">
your Prie&s;ts and all other wi&s;e Men have
&s;aid to it? Why, that it was all idle
Tales, manife&s;t Lyes, Sham, and lmpo&s;|ture;
and that if the <HI>Doctor,</HI> in Confu|tation
of the Errors of your Prie&s;ts, had
ri&s;en to Life, God would have kept him
in his Sepulchre, his full time, and have
rais'd him in the Pre&s;enee of Prie&s;ts,
Magi&s;trates and People; and that he
would have walk'd afterwards publickly
in the Streets without Danger, to the
Satisfaction of all, who knew him, that
he was the &s;ame <HI>Emms</HI> who died and
was bury'd: <HI>Without Danger,</HI> I &s;ay, from
the Populace, who would have been &s;o
far from affronting him, that they would
have almo&s;t adored him for the miracu|lous
Favour, God had done him in his
Re&s;urrection from the dead; and that
he would never have skulk'd about and
ab&s;conded him&s;elf for <HI>forty Days</HI> toge|ther,
before he was pretendedly tran&s;lated;
and therefore there was nothing but no|torious
Deceit and Impo&s;ture in all the&s;e
Pretences.</P>
<P>I need not make the Application of this
Ca&s;e and Story, which your <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> know
how to do for me. To &s;ay here, that
there's none would be &s;o de&s;perate to en|gage
in &s;uch a Fraud, as is the &s;uppo&s;ed
Ca&s;e of Dr. <HI>Emms</HI> above, is a mi&s;take.

and Ludicrou&s;ne&s;s of if. And whether
the weight and nature of his Argument
again&s;t <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection will at all
&s;tartle and &s;urpri&s;e them, I know not;
but I profe&s;s for my &s;elf, that I might
have &s;tudy'd long enough for &s;uch an
Argument again&s;t it, as this <HI>Rabbi,</HI> with
his great gray Beard, has pre&s;ently hit off.
He told me beforehand, that his Thoughts
on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection &s;hould be out of
the common Road of thinking; and I
mu&s;t needs &s;ay, he has been as good as
his Word, or no Man ever kept his Pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>There are two Things very remark|able
in his Argument: The <HI>One</HI> is, the
U&s;e and De&s;ign of &s;ealing the Stone of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Sepulchre, which he lays great
&s;tre&s;s on, to the Proof of Fraud in his
Re&s;urrection; and the <HI>other</HI> is, his Appli|cation
of the&s;e Words, <HI>the la&s;t Error</HI> (or
<PB N="42" REF="51">
as he reads Deceit or Impo&s;ture) <HI>will be
wor&s;t than the fir&s;t</HI> or former, in which
he makes the <HI>Cheif Prie&s;ts</HI> in their Speech
to <HI>Pilat,</HI> to refer to <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrec|rection
as the former known Impo&s;ture.
If his Application be ju&s;t and true, the
Con&s;equence is that the Re&s;urrections of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> are both Impo&s;tures.
It grieves me to the Heart to think of
this Con&s;equence, which our <HI>Divines</HI> are
to &s;ee to, and evade, if they can. No
&s;ooner did I read his Application of the
fore&s;aid Words, but I run to our <HI>Commen|tators</HI>
for another and better Expo&s;ition of
them: But alas! to my Sorrow, they
made nothing of them, but a &s;ort of a
<HI>proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> which the <HI>Cheif
Prie&s;ts</HI> mu&s;t have &s;poil'd and knock'd out
of Joint. Being then under great Trou|ble
for the Truth of Chri&s;tianity and the
Certainty of the&s;e two grand Miracles,
I refer the matter to our Learned <HI>Clergy,</HI>
de&s;iring them to be as &s;peedy as they
can in another and more proper Inter|pretation
of the fore&s;aid Words, or <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Infidels</HI> will run away with them
in the <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s Sen&s;e, to the Confutation
of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider'd lately, tint <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> drew
nigh, when it was u&s;ual for our <HI>Divines</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="52">

<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Re&s;urrection; and therefore I

of the Sepulchre, and of <HI>the la&s;t Error</HI> or

treat on. He that produces a Sermon or

<P>III. To con&s;ider, what <HI>Je&s;us</HI> means,
when he appeals to his Works and Miracles,
<PB N="51" REF="60">
as to a Te&s;timony and witne&s;s of his Au|thority;
and to &s;how that he did not pro|perly
and ultimately refer to tho&s;e done in
the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but to tho&s;e my&s;tical ones he would
do in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> of which tho&s;e done in
the Fle&s;h are but mere Types and Sha|dows.</P>
<P>And on this Head I &s;hall be &s;hort, there
being no Occa&s;ion of many Words on it.
The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;toral Letter, p. 25.</NOTE> has collected,
many Sayings of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> wherein he &s;eems
to appeal to the Works he then did and had
done in Fle&s;h, as to a witne&s;s of him. But
why might not <HI>Je&s;us</HI> then Prophe&s;y, and
mean the &s;piritual Works which <HI>He-in-us</HI>
would do? It is the known Way of the
Prophets to &s;peak of Things to come, as if
they were already pa&s;t, becau&s;e &s;uch Pro|phecys
are not to be under&s;tood, till their
Accompli&s;hment: Even &s;o did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> Pro|phe&s;y,
when he appeal'd to his Works as
I could prove from the Nature and Man|ner
of his Expre&s;&s;ions, but that the Argu|ment
would be dry and tedious; And there|fore
I refer the Matter entirely to the Fa|thers,
who a&s;&s;erted that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> prophe&s;ied
in his <HI>Miracles</HI> as well as in his <HI>Parables,</HI>
and that the Works, he then did in the Fle&s;h
were but Types of his my&s;terious Operati|ons,
<PB N="52" REF="61">
that would be the Demon&s;tration of
his Authority and Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip. Hence it
is that <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Adventus quidem Chri&s;ti unus in Humilitate com|pletus e&s;t, alius vero Speratur in Gloria. Et hic primus Adventus in Carne, my&s;tico quodam Sermone in Scripturis Sanctis Umbra ejus appellatur. <HI>In Je&s;u Nave Homil.</HI> viii.</NOTE> &s;ays that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s fir&s;t

Spiritual Advent; and that his <NOTE N="26" PLACE="foot">Vera Chri&s;ti Miracula &amp; Sanatio Infirmorum e&s;t &s;piritalis. <HI>In Matt. C.</HI> xxv.</NOTE> true Miracles, by which his Authority is to be

<HI>Hilary</HI> repeatedly &s;ays <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Haec licet in pra&s;ens ge&s;ta &s;unt, quid tamen in futurum &s;ignificent, contuendum e&s;t. <HI>In Matt. C.</HI> x. <HI>S.</HI> 1.

Works were &s;ignificative and predictive of
my&s;terious Operations, which we were e&s;|pecially
to look to. And Hence it is that
all the other Fathers interpreted the Mira|cles
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in a my&s;tical and allegorical
Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion then is, to what Miracles
did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> truly and properly appeal, in
the Opinion of the Fathers, for his Autho|rity
and Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip? Was it to his Typi|cal
or Antitypal Works? was it to the <HI>&s;ha|dow</HI>
or to the <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;tance</HI> of his Operations?
<PB N="53" REF="62">
To his &s;ub&s;tantial Operations, to be &s;ure,
which are and will be his &s;piritual ones

will be a proper Proof of his divine Power.

How great a Miracle it was thus to cure

<HI>decently</HI> and <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> to admire the Wi&s;|dom

<PB N="58" REF="67">
&s;pent all &s;he had upon Phy&s;icians to no

is of the Office of the true Me&s;&s;iah, to
give <HI>abundance of Peace</HI> to Mankind, to
<HI>make the Lion to lye down with the Lamb</HI>;

that there has been nothing but
wrangling and jangling and &s;colding and
fighting about him ever &s;ince. I wonder
the want of the Accompli&s;hment of the

occa&s;ion'd the Rejection of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Me&s;&s;iah|&s;hip,

<P>Bi&s;hop <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> admires <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of <HI>Naza|reth</HI>
for <HI>his cur&s;ing the Figtree</HI>; <HI>for not
bearing Fruit out of Sea&s;on</HI>: Shame on
that Miracle, according to the Letter, and
on all Admirers of it! But I am for the
&s;piritual <HI>Je&s;us</HI> who at his Coming to the
Figtree of his Church will make its <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI>
unfruitful State to <HI>wither away,</HI> and
<PB N="61" REF="70">
cau&s;e it to produce the Fruits of the Spi|rit,

pray and &s;ay too, Ble&s;&s;ed are all tho&s;e who

<P>After this Fa&s;hion could I go thro' the
other Miracles, I have treated on in the&s;e
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI>; and Upon the Compari&s;on &s;et
plainly before the Eyes of my <HI>Readers</HI> the

Stupendou&s;ne&s;s, U&s;e and Excellency: But,
what I have here done in the &s;even In&s;tances
above, is enough to induce us to believe,
with the Fathers, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s fir&s;t Coming
in the <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> was but Type and Shadow of
his &s;econd Advent in the <HI>Spirit</HI>; and that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> of old when he appeal'd to his
Works then done, as to a Witne&s;s of his
Authority, did only Prophe&s;y, and re er|ultimately
to his my&s;tical Operations, that
are alone the Proof of his Godlike and
divine Power. Bi&s;hop <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> &s;ays <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;toral Letter, p. 3.</NOTE>
of me, that <HI>pretending to rai&s;e the Ac|tions
and Miracles of our Saviour to a
more exalted and &s;piritual Meaning, I</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="71"><HI>have labour'd to take away the Reality
of them, and by that to de&s;troy one of the
principal Evidences of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> But
I pre&s;ume now, he'll be &s;en&s;ible of the
Ra&s;hne&s;s and Incogitancy of that Accu|&s;ation.

in Ca&s;e he write any more for <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
<HI>litteral</HI> Miracles in Oppo&s;ition to his
<HI>allegorical</HI> ones, that he's like the Dog
in the Fable (the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> will excu&s;e the
Coar&s;ne&s;s of the Compari&s;on) that let go
the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of his Mutton, and catch'd
at the Shadow, and &s;o, like a fooli&s;h
<HI>Cur</HI> as he was, lo&s;t both.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the <HI>Three</HI>
general Heads at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to be hand|led
in the&s;e <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> Now whether
I am, upon the whole, an <HI>Infidel</HI> or <HI>Be|leiver</HI>
of Chri&s;tianity, the World is to
judge. I'll make no more &s;olemn Decla|rations
of my Belief of it, much le&s;s at
this Juncture of Time, when I am under
Pro&s;ecution for Infidelity; becau&s;e it
would be a &s;neaking, tame and cowardly
Act in me, and &s;uch an Argument of
that meanne&s;s of Spirit, as I abhor and
dete&s;t. My <HI>Works</HI> &s;hall &s;peak for me, in
which being, con&s;cious of the Innocency
of my Intentions, and of the U&s;efulne&s;s
of my De&s;ign, I mean to proceed; not
doubting but &s;ome of our <HI>Clergy,</HI> upon
<PB N="63" REF="72">
two or three more <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> again&s;t the
Letter of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> will find
me out, what I am, and whether I am
not a true Profe&s;&s;or of the Religion of the
&s;piritual and holy <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, I'll not compound
the Difference depending between Bi&s;hop
<HI>Gib&s;on</HI> and my&s;elf, upon any other Terms,
than his making me ample Satisfaction
for the Injurys done to my Reputation
and low Fortunes. Tho he may thir&s;t
after my Life, or at lea&s;t, my Liberty;
yet under the Providence of God I fear
not the Lo&s;s of either. God be prais'd,
this Kingdom is ble&s;s'd with &s;uch a
Civil Admini&s;tration for Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice

from them.</P>
<P>There is &s;omewhat <HI>popular</HI> indeed, tho
nothing true nor rational, in the Clamour

Bi&s;hop <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> would in&s;inuate <NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;toral Letter, p. 35.</NOTE> that
my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> on <HI>Miracles</HI> &s;trike <HI>at the
Foundation of civil Society</HI>; but by an un|natural
<PB N="64" REF="73">
Con&s;equence of his own making.
I confe&s;s, it is an heinous Crime to write
any Thing, that tends to the Subver&s;ion or
Prejudice of the civil Society: But how
will the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> make me guilty of it? If
the <HI>Clergy</HI> will not be Di&s;turbers of the
Peace of the publick upon my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI>;
it's certain, that the Quiet of the World,
which I wi&s;h and aim at, will be inviolably
kept and pre&s;erv'd for all me. My Fol|lowers
indeed, when I walk the Streets of
this <HI>City,</HI> are <HI>numerous</HI>; and if any of them
&s;hould break the Peace, what &s;erves my
<HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s Power for, but to cha&s;ti&s;e
them for it? As for my &s;elf and my Adhe|rents
at home which as yet are <HI>without
Number,</HI> we are all <HI>Quieti&s;ts</HI> and &s;hould act
again&s;t our Con&s;ciences and Religion, if we
&s;hould injure any Man in his Per&s;on and
Property. But I &s;mile to &s;ee a <HI>Clergyman</HI>
all on a &s;udden, like the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> &s;o tender
of the Welfare of the Publick, when <HI>Eccle|&s;ia&s;ticks,</HI>
in all Ages pa&s;t, have been the
<HI>Bane</HI> of Society and the <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> of Mankind,
as appears from the Wars and Per&s;ecu|tions,
they have rais'd in the World; and
from that Strife, Variance and Di&s;cords,
they have occa&s;ion'd in Citys and Familys.
And with Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> who
I hope will not be angry for my &s;aying
it, I am &s;ure, the <HI>Clergy</HI> at this Juncture,
<PB N="65" REF="74">
even darken'd and ob&s;cured the &s;eemingly
native &s;implicity of the Story of the Life
of Je&s;us. So leaving you to chew upon this,
I turn</P>
<P>My Addre&s;s to <HI>Infidels,</HI> particularly to
the two mo&s;t renown'd Writers of the
Party, Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and Mr. <HI>Scheme.</HI> I
&s;hould, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> by Right &s;alute you
with the Title of <HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI> a proper
Name for your Philo&s;ophical Sect, who
are for the free Exerci&s;e of your Rea&s;on
about divine and &s;peculative Points in
Theology. And I had di&s;tingui&s;h'd you
by this Title from your Apo&s;tatical Ad|ver&s;arys,
but that I had a Mind to ob|lige
my old Friends the <HI>Clergy</HI> in giving
you a no more honourable Title than I
do them. And I tru&s;t you will not be
offended at the Title of <HI>Infidels,</HI> &s;ince not
only your Writings &s;eem to have a Ten|dency
to Infidelity; but, if there be any
Fault in your Principles, you know how
to charge it on your Adver&s;arys, the pre|tended
Advocates for Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e
Ab&s;urditys, fal&s;e Rea&s;onings. Incon&s;i&s;ten|cys,
and fooli&s;h Glo&s;&s;es on the Scriptures
have occa&s;ion'd your departure from the
Faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I thank Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> for the noble Pre|&s;ent
of his Book, which I received and
read with Plea&s;ure. But in&s;tead of one,
<PB N="66" REF="75">
he &s;hould have &s;ent me a <HI>Dozen</HI> for the
U&s;e of Friends and Borrowers, who are
very curious and importunate for the Per|u&s;al
of it. For what Rea&s;on He envys
the <HI>Book&s;ellers</HI> the publick Sale of his Work,
chu&s;ing rather to give it away <HI>gratis,</HI> than
that they &s;hould reap any Profit by it,
I know not. Surely it is not to bring
an <HI>Odium</HI> on the <HI>Clergy</HI> for Per&s;ecutors,
as if &s;uch an u&s;eful and philo&s;ophical
Piece might not appear publickly without
danger from them: If &s;o, I hope the
<HI>Clergy</HI> will re&s;ent the Indignity, and invite
him to a Publication of his Book, with
a Promi&s;e of Impunity, which would
wipe off the Reproach, which this clan|de&s;tine
Method of di&s;po&s;ing of it has ca&s;t
on them.</P>
<P>I once almo&s;t de&s;pair'd, <HI>Sirs,</HI> of &s;eeing
&s;uch another Piece from your Quarter. I
was afraid the Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Moderator</HI>
would have deterr'd you from the Pre&s;s,
whereby our excellent Controver&s;y on Foot
mu&s;t have been drop't: But the &s;udden and
unexpected appearance of Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has
revived me, and rejoiced the Cockles of my
Heart. Go on then, <HI>Great Sirs,</HI> in this
Controver&s;y, which Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> happily
commenc'd, and if you are deny'd the Li|berty
of the Pre&s;s, and publick Sale of your
Books, I hope you'll, for all that, as occa&s;i|on
<PB N="67" REF="76">
offers it &s;elf, oblige the Learned and Cu|rious
with &s;ome more of your bright Lucu|brations,
tho' you Print them, and di&s;po&s;e
of them in this clancular and &s;ubtile Me|thod.</P>
<P>It is not that I wi&s;h well to your Cau&s;e
of Infidelity, that I thus encourage you.
You have more Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on than to
&s;u&s;pect me tainted with unbelieving Prin|ciples.
Chri&s;tianity will &s;tand its Ground
again&s;t your battering Armour; and the
Church of Chri&s;t will be the more firmly
e&s;tabli&s;h'd on a Rock of Wi&s;dom, for that
Oppo&s;ition you make to it. Tho' you will
entirely vanqui&s;h the litteral <HI>Schemi&s;ts,</HI>
and ride in Triumph over them; yet o|ther
Defenders of the Faith, call'd <HI>Allego|ri&s;ts,</HI>
will ari&s;e to your Confutation and
final overthrow.</P>
<P>If I am not mi&s;taken, <HI>Sirs,</HI> your Ad|ver&s;arys,
the litteral <HI>Schemi&s;ts,</HI> whom I
call <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> are about making a Retreat,
and yeilding the Field of Battle to you.
The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> the greate&s;t Ge|neral
on their Side, will not only find it
hard to levy any more Forces in Defence
of his <HI>twelve</HI> litteral Prophecys; but he
knows, that, if he draw his Sword any
more again&s;t you, he mu&s;t attack too the
Authority of the Fathers for the allego|rical
Interpretation of &s;ome of tho&s;e Pro|phecys,
<PB N="68" REF="77">
already urg'd in my <HI>Supplements</HI> to
the <HI>Moderator</HI>; or, if the Fathers are
neglected by him; they and I, keeping out
of the Reach of his <HI>Bug-Pear,</HI> will treat
him with &s;uch familiar Language, as never
was given to one of his Order.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> &s;eems to promi&s;e us a Di&s;|cour&s;e
on the Miracles in the Scriptures,
I hope he'll be as good as his Word, and
'ere long publi&s;h it. This Di&s;cour&s;e of
mine can't po&s;&s;ibly &s;uper&s;ede his. As I
que&s;tion not, but his Thoughts and Re|marks

&s;o I &s;hall be a little impatient till
I &s;ee them. But be his Di&s;cour&s;e on Mi|racles
of what Kind &s;oever, I believe it
will hardly be an Ob&s;truction to my Un|dertaking
