<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>SO various and complicated are the
&s;cenes of this life, that &s;even years
have elap&s;ed &s;ince the following pages
were written, a period, perhaps, more
favourable for publi&s;hing than the
pre&s;ent; but timidity, or other hinder|ances
have repeatedly prevented their
appearing before the public; during
which time the author hoped &s;ome more
able advocate would have taken up the
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
cau&s;e, to do ju&s;tice to a &s;ubject of &s;uch
importance to &s;ociety at large, and par|ticularly
a much injured part thereof.
For, alas! it is too well known, that
female education, in general, is con|fined
within very narrow limits, and
&s;eldom permitted to extend to cla&s;&s;ical
accompli&s;hments. The writer of this
volume being a female, with only a
female's education, is &s;ufficiently aware
of her inadequacy to the undertaking,
but tru&s;ts the importance of the &s;ubject
will claim &s;ome attention ; at the &s;ame
time, repo&s;ing a full confidence in the
candour and unbounded goodne&s;s of
&s;ome part of her readers at lea&s;t, &s;he
is once more encouraged to re&s;ume the
pen, to add, or amend &s;uch remarks as
the nature of the times and circum|&s;tanccs
require, and, at length, has &s;o far
&s;urmounted her timidity, as to &s;ubmit
the following &s;heets, with all their im|perfections,
<PB N="v" REF="6">
perfections, to the in&s;pection of a ge|nerous
public, who are more ready to
appreciate the works of individuals
from the rectitude of intention, than
the beauty of compo&s;ition. The at|tempt,
&s;he mu&s;t acknowledge, has co&s;t
her many a painful emotion ; for a fir&s;t
attempt, &s;urrounded by all the di&s;ad|vantages
peculiar to the &s;ex, &s;eems, to
her, to require no &s;mall &s;hare of cou|rage,
and which, indeed, nothing but
the importance of the &s;ubject &s;hould
have induced her to encounter.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the following pages
is an attempt to delineate the &s;itua|tion
of tho&s;e poor, helple&s;s, females
who&s;e &s;ufferings, from a variety of
cau&s;es, are too grievous to be borne;
the &s;ources and dire con&s;equences of
which the exalted in life cannot form
the lea&s;t conception, unle&s;s they con|de&s;cend
to examine for them&s;elves,
when, it is to be hoped, their griev|ances
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
will be &s;ought into and redre&s;&s;ed.
The munificence of the people of Great
Britain, which is ever ready and adequate
to the &s;upport, aid, and comfort, of the
afflicted, when their troubles are fully in|ve&s;tigated;
and the great number of un|fortunate
women, who, doubtle&s;s, would
rejoice to become virtuous and u&s;eful
members of &s;ociety, in &s;ome lawful em|ployment,
have encouraged the author
to offer this feeble repre&s;entation. Nor
can &s;he de&s;pair of eventual &s;ucce&s;s to
the cau&s;e &s;he has engaged in, if &s;he is
but &s;o happy as to excite the attention
of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ouls are enlarged with
the exalted ideas of Chri&s;tian charity.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is a work which, as a duty
to our fellow creatures, &s;he has long,
very long, wi&s;hed to &s;ee executed by a
more able pen; but the &s;ilence of others,
the liberality of a generous public, and
a mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h to &s;ee mi&s;cry allevi|ated,
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
and virtuous indu&s;try crowned
with abundant &s;ucce&s;s, have been the
principal motives to her engaging in &s;o
arduous an undertaking. Con&s;cious,
however, that whatever good may be
the re&s;ult, the prai&s;e alone is due to
the benevolent principles of humanity.</P>
<P>The author, at the &s;ame time, wi&s;hes
it to be under&s;tood, that &s;he has not
been &s;timulated, from vain and ambi|tious
views, to appear in print, but ra|ther
from the pure philanthropic mo|tive
of throwing in her humble mite
towards the much-wi&s;hed-for relief of
the&s;e mo&s;t pitiable objects of di&s;tre&s;s;
numbers of whom, from the want of a
fair repre&s;entation of their ca&s;e, &s;he
greatly fears, are unable to obtain &s;hel|ter
under the au&s;picious &s;hade of Chri&s;|tian
charity; and, con&s;equently, are
compelled to &s;hare the fate of the
mo&s;t wretched of human beings. She
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
wi&s;hes to repre&s;ent the ca&s;e of tho&s;e
who would be indu&s;trious, if they might,
but are held down by the mo&s;t power|ful
influence of cu&s;tom and mi&s;repre|&s;entation;
and, con&s;equently, are in|capable,
without the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
humanity, to find redre&s;s, or even again
to tread the paths of virtue. But, alas!
finding her&s;elf &s;o feeble an advocate, &s;he
can only hold the pen of Truth, whil&s;t
Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice plead their cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>" Say, &s;ir&s;t of God above, or man below,</L>
<L>" What can we rea&s;on from, but what we know?"</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LET not the fair fame of this country be
tarni&s;hed with an unnoticed appeal; in par|ticular,
an appeal of &s;uch magnitude as to
involve, at once, the peace, the happine&s;s,
and the welfare of every individual. The
author's de&s;ign is by no means to contend
for power, but protection for this oppre&s;&s;ed
people; imagining that to be the &s;irme&s;t ba&s;is
on which to e&s;tabli&s;h the happine&s;s of both
&s;exes.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, however, when cu&s;tom
has given permanency to any practice, how|ever
evil in its tendency, it is next to impo&s;&s;i|ble
to effect its removal, or to &s;ucceed in any
rea&s;onable claim; therefore I contend not
<PB N="x" REF="11">
with the lords of the creation, for any other
privilege than that protection, which they
them&s;elves avow to be the <HI>real rights of
women.</HI> I would not have it under&s;tood,
that the generality of women, any more than
men, are incapable of acquiring the &s;ame
degree of knowledge and improvement in
literature; and happy am I to learn, that
this &s;tate of prohibition is not general; and
that a cla&s;&s;ical education, in &s;ome parts, is
not confined to men alone; for, if the author
is not mi&s;informed, it is upwards of &s;even
years &s;ince there was an e&s;tabli&s;hment formed
in Philadelphia, where youth and innocence
find protection from the guardian genius, In|&s;truction,
who&s;e emblematical trophy may
very well be formed of Knowledge gaining
the victory over Ignorance.</P>
<P>But the&s;e advantages, in Britain, being mo|nopolized
by the male &s;ex, permit me to a&s;k,
if it is not their duty, at lea&s;t, to afford pro|tection
in their &s;lead; for, &s;urely, if they re|fu&s;e
to protect, they have no right whatever
to govern.</P>
<Q><PB N="xi" REF="12">
<L>"Britons, attend! be worth like this approv'd,</L>
<L>"And &s;hew you have the virtue to be mov'd."</L></Q>
<P>Therefore I am led to keep firmly to the a&s;|&s;ertion,
that it is not power, but protection,
which is required; for the generality of wo|men,
<HI>natives of this country,</HI> are &s;o perfectly
tamed, either through cu&s;tom or compul&s;ive
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that, let but the lenient hand of
protection be &s;tretched out to their aid, and,
doubtle&s;s, content and happine&s;s will re&s;ume
their &s;eat, and cheerfulne&s;s form the leading
feature, to be&s;peak the tranquillity of tho&s;e
&s;ouls, which have been &s;o long depre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All women po&s;&s;e&s;s not the Amazonian &s;pirit
of a Wol&s;tonecraft. But, indeed, unremit|ted
oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;ometimes a &s;ufficient apo|logy
for their throwing off the gentle garb of
a female, and a&s;&s;uming &s;ome more ma&s;culine
appearance; yet, when the curtain of mi&s;re|pre&s;entation
is once withdrawn, it is to be
hoped, (not donbted) that the cau&s;e of com|plaint
will quickly be removed,</P>
<P>It &s;eems, however, very nece&s;&s;ary to call
in &s;ome able a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and con&s;equently I
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
make my appeal to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and truth,
which, in checking the &s;pirit of malevolence,
&s;hould it rear its hydra head to the prejudice of
the cau&s;e, will al&s;o be the means of &s;hielding
the writer from the common cen&s;ure which the
narrow-minded, in general, be&s;tow on a fir&s;t
production.</P>
<P>A &s;erious &s;tatement of facts, it is to be
hoped, will be productive of good to great
numbers, who would be happy to relieve
their fellow-creatures, but who&s;e exalted &s;itu|ations
in life too generally preclude them the
opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of the
real wants of the wretched, or the cau&s;es of
their &s;ufferings; by exhibiting, though feebly,
a complicated picture of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that
having made my remarks chiefly on real, and
not imaginary grievances, &s;hould any thing in
the&s;e pages do violence to the critical abilities
of any of my readers, who&s;e &s;uperior educa|tion
exalts them above the level of the interior
ranks of &s;ociety, it is the writer's reque&s;t, that
the intention may be kept in remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="14">
Still, methinks, I hear the voice of rea&s;on
reproaching me, after the many acknowledged
di&s;advantages, for attempting to write on a
&s;ubject of &s;uch weighty importance. Indeed,
con&s;idering the great number of eminent
writers that are daily di&s;playing their erudi|tion
in a variety of &s;ubjects, and in &s;tyles &s;o
very far &s;uperior to my poor abilities, the un|dertaking
were pre&s;umption it&s;elf. But,
amid&s;t the abundant &s;hew of publications
which are daily u&s;hered into the world, I have
not &s;een one on a &s;ubject &s;imilar to this.
This alone is the exciting cau&s;e to my under|taking,
in which it will be my utmo&s;t am|bition
to be the humble means of directing
the tender eye of benevolence to worthy ob|jects
of commi&s;eration; or, inducing &s;ome
more able advocate to take up the cau&s;e of a
much-injured and oppre&s;&s;ed part of the com|munity.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, in their journey through life, a
number of my fellow travellers have made the
same ob&s;ervations with my&s;elf, though they
have not made them public; yet, willing to
&s;uppo&s;e <HI>that</HI> &s;ilence did not proceed from a
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
want of tho&s;e philanthropic di&s;po&s;itions which
have, at all times, di&s;tingui&s;hed Britons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
will &s;uppo&s;e this great omi&s;&s;ion, for undoubt
edly great it will appear, when properly in
ve&s;tigated, cannot po&s;&s;ibly have been occa|&s;ioned
from any other cau&s;e than the force o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
cu&s;tom, by which the greate&s;t part of the com|munity
have been &s;o long hoodwinked; and
tho&s;e grievances pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence, of which
I am about to &s;peak. Many excellent chari|ties
this country &s;upports, and many worthy
individuals &s;eem to exult in &s;tepping forward
to the aid of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ; nor is it to be
doubted, that many more would as cheerfully
contribute in &s;upport of the &s;till unfortunate
and oppre&s;&s;ed, were they made acquainted with
the real objects: but, alas! when keen adver|&s;ity
&s;trikes its pointed dart into the bo&s;om of
the afflicted, the pain is too great to admit of
an explanation ; and when pa&s;t, their only en|deavour
is to bury its remembrance in obli|vion:
therefore, unle&s;s &s;ome friendly hand take
up the pen, how can tho&s;e, who are enabled by
fortune and prompted by compa&s;&s;ion, &s;tretch
forth the hand of clemency to di&s;tre&s;&s;es, of which
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
they never heard; or, like the good Samari|tan,
pour oil into wounds which they never
&s;aw. In the mean time, then, let mine be the
painful, though voluntary, ta&s;k; and even,
&s;hould the de&s;ign not immediately meet with
the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, no doubt, but in a &s;hort
time it may, by the kindly interference of the
great, powerful, and humane inve&s;tigators of
human calamities, to the emancipation of this
oppre&s;&s;ed part of the human kind.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the Magdalen
charity, it is true, an objection was &s;tarted,
which was founded upon this candid que&s;tion:
"What will you do with &s;uch poor creatures,
when you have them?" But the difficulty
was as &s;oon &s;olved by Robert Dingley, E&s;q.
the fir&s;t humane propo&s;er of the charity. Nor
is there a doubt, were a &s;imilar enquiry to
take place, it would as &s;oon be &s;olved; for
what undertaking is too bold for man to at|tempt,
when a re&s;toration of happine&s;s to his
fellow creatures is the object. I &s;hall, then,
cheerfully proceed to offer the following ge|neral
hints, which, it is hoped, will be im|proved
upon to the good of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>THE
FEMALE ADVOCATE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART FIRST. THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF MEN
TRADERS ENGROSSING WOMEN'S
OCCUPATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>TO detail human mi&s;ery in all its various
&s;hapes is not in the power of any individual:
&s;o complicated and numerous are the ills of
this life, and &s;o various its misfortunes, that
we need not have recour&s;e to the airy regions
of fiction or romance, to find out objects of
di&s;tre&s;s, to pourtray the woes of our fellow
creatures; yet, from motives of delicacy,
<PB N="18" REF="18">
beg leave to withhold names, le&s;t the &s;uf|fering
objects &s;hould feel hurt at the me|lancholy
recital of their tale of woe; and
&s;hall therefore only &s;elect a few in&s;tances, and
leave the candid morali&s;t to take a compara|tive
view of the re&s;t, through all the wonder|ful
mazes and wide tracts, to which a part of
our fellow mortals have been condemned.&mdash;And
by what? not by divine law, which is,
or ought to be, the &s;tanding rule of all our
action, but by an evil precedent, which hap|pens
to fall with all its force upon that part of
the community, who&s;e feeble powers of re|&s;i&s;tance,
joined to an habitual pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
are the lea&s;t able to defend them. Con|&s;equently
it has never yet been thought a
bu&s;ine&s;s worth inve&s;tigation, although &s;o many
others, of much le&s;s moment, have been
&s;ought out, and redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When we look around us, nothing is more
con&s;picuous in the eyes of the world, than
the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of women. I do not &s;ay tho&s;e
whom a kind Providence hath placed under
the immediate care of a tender father, or an
affectionate and kind hu&s;band; or, <HI>by chance,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
a friend, or brother. But the&s;e, alas! com|pri&s;e
only one part of the community. Not|with&s;tanding
all are of the &s;ame nature, and
were formed by the &s;ame Divine Power, yet
their comforts differ very widely indeed. Still,
as women &s;eem formed by nature to &s;eek pro|tection
from man, why, in the name of ju&s;|tice,
refu&s;e the boon? Does it not become
highly worthy the attention of men in general,
to con&s;ider in what manner to redre&s;s the
grievances <HI>already within their notice?</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, and very ju&s;tly,
that, con&s;idering human frailty, there is
among&s;t women, as well as men, a va&s;t num|ber
of vicious and unde&s;erving. Granted;
&s;till, is it not better to pa&s;s over a hundred
guilty, than let puni&s;hment fall upon one
innocent per&s;on?&mdash;Be&s;ides, IS THERE NOT
A POSSIBILITY OF FORMING A PLAN OF
DISCRIMINATION, FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE ONLY WHO MERIT SUCH HUMANE
AND FRIENDLY INTERFERENCE?</P>
<P>Some years ago, who would have been
made believe, &s;o many per&s;ons could be re|&s;tored
to life, as the Royal Humane Society,
<PB N="20" REF="20">
for the recovering of drowned per&s;ons, has
effected? Yet &s;o it is; which proves to a de|mon&s;tration,
the practicability of this de|&s;ign.
But before I proceed with my Hint for
e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ecting any e&s;tabli&s;hed plan, for the re&s;tora|tion
of peace and happine&s;s to the, perhaps,
once happy, but now mo&s;t mi&s;erable of be|ings,
I cannot help making a remark, that,
in order to lay a good foundation, every
builder mu&s;t find it nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t, to remove
the rubbi&s;h out of his way&mdash;So let us proceed
to the ground-work of the de&s;ign; and. be|fore
any further &s;leps are taken, a&s;k, What
can be &s;aid in favour of men-milliners, men-manu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a-makers,
and men &s;tay-makers? be|&s;ides
all the numerous train of other pro&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
&s;uch as hair-dre&s;&s;ers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all of
which occupations are much more calculated
for women than men. But, thanks to the fa|&s;hions
of the times, for once, which have near|ly
exploded that di&s;graceful cu&s;tom of men
dre&s;&s;ing ladies' hair, by the introduction of
all the brutu&s;es and chignons, of every deno|mination,
which have found their way to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">lets of all de&s;criptions of females.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">
Where is there a Stevens now? was there
ever a wider field for the di&s;play of his ta|lents?
Yet, if perukes are the fa&s;hion of the
day, what is to prevent a woman from di&s;play|ing
her ta&s;te upon a lady's head as well as a
man, who &s;eems much better calculated for a
more ma&s;culine employment.</P>
<P>"Look," &s;ays an ob&s;erver, "to the &s;hops

twenty fellows, &s;ix feet high, may be counted
in each, to the utter exclu&s;ion of poor females,
who could &s;ell a tooth-pick, or a few ribbons,
ju&s;t as well."</P>
<P>A tax upon the&s;e fellows would be very &s;a|lutary,
&s;o &s;ay I ; yet, for a poor female indi|vidual
to attack &s;o numerous a body of men,
however in&s;ignificant by cu&s;tom, is a bold
&s;troke, no doubt; yet, having thrown the&s;e &s;en|timents

without exceptions, &s;o in this ca&s;e more than
one mu&s;t be granted, which &s;hall be treated
of in a &s;ub&s;equent part of the&s;e pages. To
cla&s;s the innocent with the guilty would be
doing inju&s;tice to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, where are the&s;e fa|thers,
hu&s;bands, brothers, and profe&s;&s;ed friends
to virtue and happine&s;s, who &s;tep not forward
in the bu&s;ine&s;s? No doubt but there are many
men of great probity and humanity, and yet,
through the progre&s;&s;ive cour&s;e of cu&s;tom,
have not adverted <HI>either</HI> to the cau&s;e or its
fatal con&s;equences; or, in fine, are not aware
of the real di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow-creatures;
from which idea it is &s;o frequently wi&s;hed a
reference to facts may take place, &s;ince neither
the &s;ufferings of the&s;e poor women, nor the
cau&s;e of their &s;ufferings can po&s;&s;ibly be known,
but by inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed but all, in &s;ome de|gree,
&s;hare the: common misfortunes in life;

<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
But, in the ca&s;e of the&s;e poor women, where
is there a &s;tate nearly equal to theirs? borne
down by fate's afflicting hand, they are not
able to act, or &s;eck redre&s;s; and this, by the
unfeeling part of the world, we have too great
rea&s;on to fear, is termed idlene&s;s and profli|gacy.</P>
<P>What a littlene&s;s of mind ! what an un|feeling

dark moments of di&s;tre&s;s, when the &s;en&s;es are
all alive to the fine feelings of nature, that
every nerve is relaxed and ready to receive
the fatal dart.</P>
<P>Then indeed it is, that &s;he &s;tands expo&s;ed in

of the ca&s;e at fir&s;t view; but when once

I can never force my&s;elf to a belief, that

darts from the &s;ons of her bo&s;om, as her only
reward for all that maternal affection and
kindne&s;s which the helple&s;s &s;tate of infancy
and childhood render &s;o nece&s;&s;ary: inde|pendently,
does it not &s;eem a &s;ocial intere&s;t
in nature, to give aid and &s;uccour to one an|other?</P>
<P>No: it was never intended that women
&s;hould be left de&s;titute in the world, without
the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, which they
<PB N="27" REF="27">
&s;o frequently experience, even without any
lawful or reputable means of acquiring
them, through the vile practice of men fill|ing
&s;uch &s;ituations as &s;eem calculated, not
only to give bread to poor females, but
thereby to enable them to tread the paths of
virtue, and render them u&s;eful members, in
&s;ome lawful employment, as well as ornaments
to their profe&s;&s;ions and &s;ex. This lovely ap|pearance,
alas! is but too often thrown a&s;ide,
and, frequently, <HI>not</HI> from vicious inclinations,
but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of bartering their
virtue for bread.</P>
<P>Then, is it not highly worthy the attention
of men, men who profe&s;s moral virtue and the
&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of <HI>honour,</HI> to con&s;ider in what
mode to redre&s;s the&s;e grievances! for wo|men
were ultimately de&s;igned for &s;omething
better, though they have &s;o long fared other|ways.</P>
<P>That there &s;hould he a mixture of characters
in the world is, beyond a doubt, for wi&s;e and
good rea&s;ons, which we poor &s;hort-&s;ighted mor|tals
know not, more than that it is a principle
in which all reflecting per&s;ons have agreed,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
that our pre&s;ent &s;tate, on this &s;ide the grave
is certainly de&s;igned for improvement, in or|der
to fit us for a better. This being admit|ted,
where can the well-di&s;po&s;ed find a better
opportunity, than by de&s;ending the innocent
and unprotected, &s;electing them from the
noxious part of mankind, with whom they are,
through keen adver&s;ity, obliged to a&s;&s;ociate;
and placing them in &s;uch &s;ituations, as will
enable them, to pur&s;ue the paths of virtue, by

<P>But to accompli&s;h &s;o laudable a de&s;ign
re&s;ts both with the humane and the opu|lent,
by who&s;e inve&s;tigation, there is not a
doubt, but it will be found a work of the ut|mo&s;t
importance, not only in the pre&s;ent &s;tate
of things but in looking forward to a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion.
For in times like the pre&s;ent, is not the
aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men required in the mi|litary
and naval departments? And in more
peaceable times, which we have to look for|ward
to, are not, or ought not, the manufac|tories
of the country to be the fir&s;t object con|&s;idered?
In either of the&s;e ca&s;es, it evidently
<PB N="29" REF="29">
appears, that men may be much better employ|ed
than in filling women's occupations. For, in
the words of St. Luke, the&s;e poor females
may very ju&s;tly &s;ay, "to dig I cannot, to beg
I am a&s;hamed." From this evil precedent,
there is no other alternative for the&s;e poor
women, but beggary or vice !</P>
<P>Let us then, if you plea&s;e, &s;elect one of
the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed females, out of the prodigious
multitude, and pur&s;ue her through the humi|liating
&s;cene of beggary: I believe it is grant|ed,
that pride is well known to be the pre|dominant
pa&s;&s;ion of the human brea&s;t, and
con&s;equently any comments on that head are
needle&s;s; but certain it mu&s;t be, that after,
perhaps, a life of ea&s;e and affluence, to be
compelled to &s;uch a mortifying &s;ituation, re|quires
more than a common &s;hare of forti|tude
to &s;upport. Still this prevailing pa&s;&s;ion,
with all its train of attendants, mu&s;t be &s;ub|dued,
in the dreadful &s;ituation of beggary
which cannot fail to bring down the &s;pi|rits
of the&s;e unhappy victims, with more
oppre&s;&s;ive force than it is in the power of
words to expre&s;s, or pen to paint, and can
<PB N="30" REF="30">
only be conceived, <HI>in part,</HI> by the &s;ilent
&s;en&s;ations of tho&s;e who can adopt another's
woes, and trace the pa&s;&s;ions of the human
mind. For what mu&s;t not be the perturba|tion
of a mind like this, when dire nece&s;&s;ity
compels the poor, neglected victim to pur&s;ue
&s;uch degrading &s;teps, in order to &s;upport a

limbs, which are &s;carcely able to &s;upport her
load of wretchedne&s;s, whil&s;t &s;he a&s;ks an alms
from the ca&s;ual pa&s;&s;enger. She who, perhaps,
a &s;hort time &s;ince, charmed her acquaintance
with her &s;prightly conver&s;ation and vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tuous
example, by one adver&s;e &s;troke, is neverthe|le&s;s
&s;o &s;oon become the contempt, the &s;corn,
and the outca&s;t of mortals! Nor is this
wretched doom confined to youth alone; but,
by the cruel hand of fate, the poor, dejected
mother, as well as daughter, is condemned to
&s;hare the &s;ame direful misfortunes, and be re|duced
to the &s;ame low &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s,
from which their characters are &s;tigmatized
with infamy, and to which they unavoidably
fall a &s;acrifice. In this mi&s;erable &s;tate
<PB N="31" REF="31">
they mu&s;t for ever remain, until the &s;pirit
of oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;taken prejudice is
eradicated, and the heavy cloud of mi&s;re|pre&s;entation
cleared away, through a proper
inve&s;tigation of the cau&s;e, which, doubtle&s;s,
will lead to a conviction; that the di&s;tre&s;s
and wretchedne&s;s of the&s;e poor, abandon|ed
creatures originate chiefly from the ava|ricious
and mercenary views of that &s;et of
beings, who are "Eating the bread of the
hungry, and drinking the drink of the thir&s;ty."
Nor are the&s;e poor women allowed "to pick
up the crumbs," which will appear in the &s;e|quel.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let us, if you plea&s;e, take
another view of this poor mother and her mi|&s;erable
daughter, in this forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
&s;tate of beggary, and there &s;ee what relief they
obtain, from their piercing accents and bro|ken
&s;ighs&mdash;little more, it is to be feared, than
contempt or in&s;ults. Even the hand of cha|rity,
accu&s;tomed to be&s;tow on the needy, no
&s;ooner ob&s;erves the appearance of youth, or
a capability of indu&s;try, than it is in&s;tantly
<PB N="32" REF="32">
withdrawn, and kept in re&s;erve (as it is
thought) for &s;ome more proper object.</P>
<P>Good heavens, what a &s;cene of woe! when
the poor mother and her helple&s;s daughter
are turned adri&s;t, to the mercy of an unfeeling
world ; which neither their genteel education,
or delicate con&s;titutions, broken down by po|verty
and hard&s;hips, can prevent. O! what
di&s;tre&s;s, in a &s;ituation like this! The mo|ther,
the fond mother, in the full bitterne&s;s
of maternal affection, takes another, and ano|ther
view of her darling child; perhaps the
only remaining pledge of a late kind partner!
&s;ees her &s;till laden with the fruits of a
pious education at lea&s;t; views her with un|utterable
fondne&s;s, "whil&s;t all the &s;oft pa&s;|&s;ions
of her tender &s;oul throb through her
brea&s;t with unavailing grief," at the near ap|proach
of their de&s;truction! In vain do they
&s;upplicate their former friends, for the voice
of cen&s;ure has pointed them out as infamous!
Good God ! what grief can equal this? Aban|doned
by friends, and left to the reproach,
contempt, and cen&s;ure of a cruel world,
<PB N="33" REF="33">
without a provi&s;ion, or any probable means of
gaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or even the &s;malle&s;t
glimp&s;e of di&s;tant hope.</P>
<P>And, though &s;hocking to relate, yet &s;uch is
the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of thou&s;ands of de|&s;encele&s;s
women.</P>
<P>Nor let the unfeeling and cen&s;orious part of
mankind refute the a&s;&s;ertion, until provi&s;ion
is made for the relief of all tho&s;e who would
be both indu&s;trious and virtuous, had they the
means. After which, the remaining few
may ju&s;tly be reckoned in the cla&s;s of incorri|gible
&s;inners, and be a &s;ufficient mode of form|ing
a di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>But until that provi&s;ion is made, it is in|human,
ba&s;e, and cruel, and beneath the dig|nity
of a Chri&s;tian, to load with infamy the
poor, neglected female, who &s;uffers through
misfortunes, and the continuation of an evil
precedent; and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ive virtue is, per|haps,
at the very in&s;tant of calumny, offering

her&s;elf and beloved child, according to the
<PB N="34" REF="34">
advice of the wi&s;e man, who &s;ays, "Ha&s;
thou children, in&s;truct them from their youth."
She remon&s;trates with the child of her bo&s;om
not with &s;tanding &s;he is her partner in wretched|ne&s;s,

in a dark pri&s;on, there to be obliged to hear
all the opprobrious language of the very low|e&s;t

<P>How many unhappy young men have fallen

<P>It is &s;aid, the city of London alone pays

<P>That political and private happine&s;s are in|variably
connected, is beyond a doubt; and
that the morals of this nation are very cor|rupt,
is but too vi&s;ible, from the va&s;t numbers
of di&s;graceful women who infe&s;t the face of
the country. As for the number of the&s;e mi|&s;erable
<PB N="48" REF="48">
&s;erable beings, it cannot be an ea&s;y matter to
a&s;certain : but &s;uppo&s;e, from the prodigious
numbers, that are &s;een &s;cattered about, like
&s;heep having no &s;hepherd, that in London, for
example, there are five or &s;ix thou&s;and: Nay;
I have either read, or heard it &s;aid, ten thou|&s;and!
but how that calculation can be made,
I &s;hall not take upon me to &s;ay ; yet, &s;up|po&s;e
we call it half that number; are not five
thou&s;and de&s;titute females too many to &s;uffer
through &s;o poor a cau&s;e, and will not a much
le&s;s number &s;uffice to contaminate the morals
of more than half the youths in town, and
prove a &s;ource of de&s;tructive oppre&s;&s;ion to a
va&s;t number of inhabitants? for, without mo|rals,
how can we expect happine&s;s, or what is
to &s;upport the public good?</P>
<P>Then, what &s;ort of beings are they, who
can, with impunity, oppre&s;s the&s;e unfortunate
women, to the entire de&s;truction of all happi|ne&s;s,
both national and dome&s;tic? Or where
is the brea&s;t, truly warm in the cau&s;e of virtue
and a country's good, who will &s;uffer the con|tinuance
of a precedent &s;o de&s;tructively op|pre&s;&s;ive,
without exerting them&s;elves in the

cau&s;e? for granting it is a great part of the

as far as we are empowered. To neglect an
inve&s;tigation of the&s;e grievances admits no
excu&s;e, when once the clouds of ob&s;curity
are di&s;per&s;ed; for enquiry is the great &s;ource
of knowledge.</P>
<P>From the holy &s;criptures we learn, that
"Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified in all her children;"
and from what but wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice is de|rived
the &s;upport of our common weal, by
inve&s;tigating which, will not the judicious
quickly di&s;cover a numerous train of oppre&s;|&s;ive
grievances not yet told. Let him but en|quire
the cau&s;e of &s;uch va&s;t numbers of con|victs
having been &s;ent abroad, to the great
expence of the nation; and &s;ee if their
connection with the&s;e nece&s;&s;itous women
has not been a great means of their mis|fortunes:
for, alas! young men, upon their
fir&s;t entrance into the world, are too often in|ebriated
with the plea&s;ing, but baneful, draught
of plea&s;ures, till their &s;en&s;es are &s;o much in|toxicated,
that they run they know not where,
and at length find them&s;elves en&s;nared in
<PB N="50" REF="50">
the net, which the&s;e poor abandoned women,
or rather the in&s;tigators of their mi&s;ery, have
&s;o artfully &s;et to entrap the unwary.</P>
<P>Yet, a &s;erious con&s;ideration, no doubt, will
prompt an enquiry, and a per&s;everance in the
pur&s;uit; and &s;urely we may hope, an under|taking,
founded on &s;uch a ba&s;is as the laws of
humanity, and a general good, can never fail
of &s;ucce&s;s. Nor will the more generous part
of men-traders, &s;uch as are before de&s;cribed,
delay to re&s;ign a privilege, maintained upon
&s;uch unju&s;t principles; for far, very far, be it
from me to &s;uppo&s;e, or entertain a with to
in&s;inuate a &s;uppo&s;ition, that all effeminate
trade&s;men are equally guilty of a known vio|lation.
Nor is any individual accu&s;ed for in|voluntary
crimes: yet, does it not behove
every member of &s;ociety to inform them&s;elves,
e&s;pecially when the object of enquiry is of
&s;uch great magnitude, as to extend beyond
the intere&s;t of individuals, and affect a whole
community?</P>
<P>It is beyond a doubt, that many men,
through the force of cu&s;tom, are ignorant of
the injury they are doing their neighbour,
<PB N="51" REF="51">
and mankind in general, the details of which
I have very &s;crupulou&s;ly collected, and may
&s;ay with Shake&s;peare, I have "nothing exte|nuated,
nor &s;et down aught in malice."</P>
<P>Indeed, I have not a wi&s;h to accu&s;e, or call in
que&s;tion, the conduct or motive of any indivi|dual.
No: &s;uffice it that Pappeal to their own
feelings, to humanity, and the go&s;pel truths;
after which, let the inward monitor of the
guilty &s;ay,
<Q>Thou art the man.</Q>
But permit me to infer, this &s;elf accu&s;ation
only extends to one part of the oppre&s;&s;ive
body; yet, what is to be &s;aid for the re|mainder,
who &s;hall &s;till per&s;evere in perfecut|ing
the&s;e poor helple&s;s women, to the &s;ubver|&s;ion

by the in&s;pired writer, "It is not the will of
our Father, which is in heaven, that one of
the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h." Then, in
compliance with our threefold obligation, are
we not &s;trictly enjoined to exhort our bre|thren
to turn from their evil ways. What

<P>That great numbers would be happy in

appear to be objects of di&s;tre&s;s, is beyond a
doubt: but, alas! for helple&s;s, injured females!
the heavy clouds of prejudice and mi&s;repre|&s;entation
have thrown &s;o dark a veil between
them and the pity of the world, that they are
de&s;pi&s;ed by all. Yet, when the curtain is once
withdrawn, and the tragic &s;cene expo&s;ed to
open view, leading the&s;e poor creatures from
ob&s;curity into open light, then will be the
cri&s;is, when every good Chri&s;tian may be

found enough to do in &s;pinning, knitting, and

the father of a family was glad to di&s;po&s;e of

fir&s;t pre&s;ented, that his &s;on might be empowered

for a wife which, in primitive times, he was
obliged to endow.</P>
<P>Alas! how much unlike our modern days,
when women endow their hu&s;bands, and, with

not every one allow, &s;o &s;mall a recompence, in

and much le&s;s to &s;upport a family. Still, in
tho&s;e days, it was found a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion,

the rea&s;on is evident; every article of provi|&s;ion
at that time bore a very inferior price to
what it does now. Wheat, for example,

enforces a conviction, that through time all
things alter. Therefore, to come to the point
in view, whil&s;t all things cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ge according to

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART SECOND. Continuation of the foregoing.
Which demon&s;trates that the Frailty of Female Virtue
more frequently originates from embarra&s;&s;ed Cir|cum&s;tances,
than from a depravity of
Di&s;po&s;ition.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given a &s;aint &s;ketch of the grand
cau&s;e which precludes women from partaking
in the comforts of life, let us next proceed to
the avenue which leads to &s;o much mi&s;ery.
Doubtle&s;s, through the vici&s;&s;itudes of human
affairs, neither great riches nor great happine&s;s
<PB N="78" REF="78">
are always permanent; the dark and crooked
paths of fate are, by the unerring hand of Di|vine
Providence, hid from mortal eyes: nor
can we &s;ee into futurity. "To-day we are here,
and to-morrow in the grave;" or, according
to the Proverbs, chap. xxvii. v. 1. "Who
knoweth what a day may bring forth?" For
how often does death, in&s;atiable death, unex|pectedly
&s;natch, in a moment, the indulgent
parent from the beloved child, who is at once
left at large in the wide world, perhaps in the
morning of her days, and in all the &s;implicity
of artle&s;s youth, without a provi&s;ion, or any
means of obtaining one. Pitiable object!
thy fate &s;eems hard indeed: yet &s;o it but too
frequently happens to hundreds, be&s;ides thy|&s;elf.
Where wilt thou go, to &s;ecure thee
from real want? A pari&s;h workhou&s;e is but a
poor con&s;olation for &s;o great a lo&s;s, at a period
when neither rea&s;on nor religion is ripened
into maturity, to moderate the grievance. But,
if, perhaps, a friend &s;tep forward, the A&s;ylum
for the protection of Orphan Girls may re|ceive
the poor fugitive; in which ble&s;&s;ed and
happy in&s;titution, through time, the memory
<PB N="79" REF="79">
of her woeful lo&s;s, in parents and provi&s;ion,
may, in &s;ome degree, be wiped away in the
benevolence of her new protectors, who not
only provide for her temporal, but al&s;o for her
&s;piritual concerns, in in&s;tructing her as a good
Chri&s;tian and a u&s;eful member. But, alas!
&s;mall is the number which this in&s;titution
can admit, when compared with the va&s;t num|bers
left in &s;imilar &s;ituations. And for tho&s;e,
who are more advanced in age, to what &s;tand|ard
can they repair? It is true, nece&s;&s;ity will
teach people to exert them&s;elves, who have no|thing
but their own indu&s;try to depend upon,
and con&s;equently they &s;eek for a female occu|pation.
But how great their &s;urpri&s;e, and inex|pre&s;&s;ible
their grief, to find, like the re&s;t, that
they are repul&s;ed in every pur&s;uit of indu&s;try,
whereby they might expect a maintenance!</P>
<P>Good Heavens! what cour&s;e can a poor,
young creature pur&s;ue, when, from the quick
tran&s;ition from good to evil, at that early pe|riod
of life, when di&s;cernment has not made its
way to a knowledge of the world, &s;he is at
once on the verge of the precipice, where &s;o
many have unhappily been lo&s;t? Without a
<PB N="80" REF="80">
pilot, &s;he finds her&s;elf launched out into the
ocean of the world, where &s;he floats about &s;o
awhile, until &s;he perceives her danger, and
would gladly retreat; but neither meeting pro+tection
nor aid, nece&s;&s;ity drives her back, and &s;he
&s;hortly engages in the di&s;&s;ipation of the
age, and at once becomes the object of &s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and contempt, and the real food for &s;candal
in which deplorable &s;tate &s;he finds her&s;elf in+volved,
even before &s;he is aware of her dan+ger,
which no &s;ooner pre&s;ents it&s;elf to he
view, but &s;he endeavours to retreat and clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
away the black vapour; but, alas! though
&s;hort-lived the experiment, it is now too late
for the mi&s;ty cloud of obloquy has di&s;coloure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
her reputation, and &s;he is now doubly di&s;tan
from a friend to defend her, or point out
mode of redre&s;s; for the unfeeling part of the
world exclaims, in the words of a much ad|mired
writer,
<Q><L>"How &s;hall I then your helple&s;s fame defend?</L>
<L>"'Twill then be infamy to &s;eem your friend."</L>
<BIBL>POPE</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>No: her &s;upplication is not noticed, not
<PB N="81" REF="81">
with&s;tanding "God hath given to every one
the charge of his neighbour."</P>
<P>This excellent charge being &s;o very &s;eldom
put in practice, &s;uperadded to her youth and
inexperience, &s;he not being &s;ufficiently armed
with that fortitude, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in
her time of trial, and &s;eeing the frowns of the
world again&s;t her, &s;he naturally per&s;everes,
and even launches out &s;till farther in the
&s;tream of tho&s;e fal&s;e and mi&s;taken plea&s;ures,
which cannot fail to terminate in her de&s;truc|tion;
and, perhaps, at length, &s;he triumphs
in obtaining (what &s;he thinks) protection from
tho&s;e who&s;e acknowledged right it is to guard
the weaker &s;ex.</P>
<P>But here, alas! under the &s;pecious name of
friend&s;hip, &s;he too &s;oon &s;ees her mi&s;take, and
finds her&s;elf the real object of di&s;tre&s;s, aban|doned
by the world, and left to her own bit|ter
reflections; until the kind hand of Provi|dence
once more takes her under protection,
and admits her a member of that humane
charity, the Magdalen; where, in a &s;mall de|gree,
&s;he is once more permitted to ta&s;te a
portion of comfort, by the cheering rays of
<PB N="82" REF="82">
Chri&s;tian charity; and her oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits
are &s;omewhat enlivened by the following &s;weet
and comfortable di&s;cour&s;e from the Matron,
on her admi&s;&s;ion into that mo&s;t excellent cha|rity.</P>
<P>"You cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the kindne&s;s
of providence in bringing you hither; the
wretched &s;ituation you are reduced to &s;eems
to offer you no other relief. Your intere&s;t
and ours is the &s;ame; we mean to do you
all the good we can, and you to have good
done to you; we mean to render you happy
in this world, and what is of much greater
moment, in the next al&s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rules and Regulations of the Magdalen Cha|rity.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>How can charity be better employed than
in taking care of the &s;oul as well as the body?
This is, perhaps, the mo&s;t comfortable di&s;|cour&s;e
&s;he has heard &s;ince death clo&s;ed the lips
of her dear parents. Yet how much greater
would be the charity for protecting the inno|cent,
than in reclaiming the guilty? Preven|tion
mu&s;t certainly be better than cure; and
<PB N="83" REF="83">
were there a capacious e&s;tabli&s;hment for indu&s;|try,
built upon &s;uch a ba&s;is as would form a
di&s;crimination between the well-bred female,
who is reduced by the un&s;een hand of fate, and
the very poor and abject, who&s;e birth has de|prived
them of the knowledge of re&s;inement or
delicacy; what crouds of unprovided women
would &s;lock to the &s;tandard!</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, it cannot fail to af|ford
infinite &s;atisfaction to the humane con|tributors,
by enabling the poor penitent to re|peat
the following hymn of admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Ri&s;e, O my &s;oul! the hours review,</L>
<L>"When aw'd by guilt and fear,</L>
<L>"Thou dur&s;t not heaven for mercy &s;ue,</L>
<L>"Nor hope for pity here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Dried are thy tears, thy griefs are fled,</L>
<L>"Di&s;pell'd each bitter care;</L>
<L>"See, heaven it&s;elf has lent its aid,</L>
<L>"To rai&s;e thee from de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Here then, O God! thy work fulfil,</L>
<L>"And from thy mercy's throne,</L>
<L>"Vouch&s;afe me &s;trength to do thy will,</L>
<L>"And to re&s;i&s;t my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="84" REF="84">
<L>"So &s;hall my &s;oul each power employ,</L>
<L>"Thy mercies to adore,</L>
<L>"Whil&s;t heav'n it&s;elf proclaims with joy,</L>
<L>"One pardon'd &s;inner more."</L>
</LG>
<P>How nearly do the humane contributors to
this excellent charity imitate the compa&s;&s;ion|ate
&s;entence of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, when he
bade the offending woman "Go, and &s;in no
more?" For there is &s;carcely a period in
life, when the mo&s;t irregular characters may
not be reclaimed. It is through misfortunes
and a want of employment, that &s;uch as
the&s;e poor, helple&s;s, young creatures have
brought &s;o great an additional load of heavy
misfortunes upon their guilty heads; yet, we
are told, there is joy in heaven at the repen|tance
of a &s;inner:&mdash;What a ble&s;&s;ed in&s;titution,
then, to provide a means for that purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>Human nature is undoubtedly liable to
corruption, yet it is impregnated with the
&s;eeds of virtue; and when the mind is proper|ly
cultivated, they will quickly grow up and
ripen into good works. It mu&s;t afford a mo&s;t
lively and plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation to the humane
and &s;ympathi&s;ing brea&s;t, in contributing their
<PB N="85" REF="85">
endeavours, to let the memory of former
woes be lo&s;t in the enjoyment of pre&s;ent ble&s;|&s;ings.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion is a heaven-born virtue, and
not only con&s;oles the innocent, but is the fir&s;t
&s;tep to reclaim the guilty: a kind and gentle
treatment mu&s;t ever be efficacious, when har&s;h
proceedings, in general, drive to de&s;peration.
For the truth of this, we need but &s;crutinize
our own hearts, (the golden rule is a mo&s;t
excellent guide) and there &s;ee, on a &s;erious
inve&s;tigation, if any one of us is not more
ready to comply, in any ca&s;e whatever, by le|nient
means, than from the force of peremp|tory
methods.</P>
<P>Yes: the mo&s;t obdurate &s;inner, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of one &s;ingle &s;park of grace, on the repeated
calm admonitions of a good Chri&s;tian, cannot
&s;uppre&s;s that &s;park from kindling into a flame
of gratitude, at lea&s;t, and mu&s;t blu&s;h at their
perfidy; whereas the hardened wretch, by
con&s;tant upbraidings and &s;evere treatment, be|comes
callous to every thing.</P>
<P>Therefore, the&s;e poor young women, who
have, through extreme nece&s;&s;ity, been driven
<PB N="86" REF="86">
to criminal and unlawful pur&s;uits, are not to
be de&s;pi&s;ed or &s;unk beneath our care, but
cheri&s;hed and &s;upported, in order to reclaim
their wicked cour&s;e of life. What &s;ays the
oracle of truth?&mdash;Whil&s;t we have time, let
us do good, for the night cometh, when no
man can work.</P>
<P>For the opulent, and tho&s;e in power, to
&s;uppo&s;e they have done their part, in help|ing
to relieve their &s;piritual wants only, is a
mi&s;take; &s;o long as the &s;oul and body act
in uni&s;on, provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made for their
temporal nece&s;&s;ities al&s;o. What &s;ays St.
James, chap. ii. v. 15 and 16. "If a bro|ther
or &s;i&s;ter be naked, and de&s;titute of daily
food, and one of you &s;ay unto them, depart
in peace, be you warmed and filled, notwith|&s;tanding
you give them not tho&s;e things which
are needful to the body, what doth it profit?"</P>
<P>But in the humane charity of the Mag|dalen,
as well as in others, the wants of the
needful are plentifully &s;upplied, both as to
&s;oul and body, and as many de&s;titute objects
received as the foundation of the in&s;titution
will admit; and, in general, &s;uch as the&s;e it
<PB N="87" REF="87">
is of whom we have been di&s;cour&s;ing (if in
London) who reap the benefit. Their ages
of admi&s;&s;ion being from &s;ixteen to twenty-&s;ix
years, between which periods they, in general,
find their fatal mi&s;take, and are happy to find
an a&s;ylum under &s;o beneficent an in&s;titution.
Or if, unhappily, their &s;ituations in life are
too far di&s;tant, or other ca&s;ual accidents pre|vent
them from obtaining the benefit, they
mu&s;t inevitably fall a victim to their misfor|tunes
and vice, and the world's contempt.
Which brings to my remembrance a poem,
entitled The Country Church Yard.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the misfortunes of &s;uch
poor young creatures are truly pitiable, others
there are who&s;e ca&s;e is &s;till more lamentable.
But to conduct my readers to the various ave|nues
which lead to the de&s;truction and mi&s;ery
of the female part of the creation, would
&s;well this volume to a greater bulk than is in|tended;
therefore &s;hall content my&s;elf with
ju&s;t touching upon a few characters, who have
been plunged into this dreadful pit of de&s;truc|tion,
by the known mi&s;conduct of connections,
or the mi&s;hap of human events. From &s;uch
as the&s;e it is we mu&s;t gather our information.
Doubtle&s;s, imagination might lead to a num|ber
<PB N="89" REF="89">
of vi&s;ionary flights, but, by engaging with
per&s;onalities, the faculties are confined, and
external appearances mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the ob|jects.</P>
<P>Let us then commence with a gentleman of
&s;mall, independent fortune; for, as it is the
general maxim through life, that every one
&s;hould endeavour to outvie his neighbour, the
gentleman al&s;o mu&s;t keep up appearances for
the benefit of his family (as he is plea&s;ed to
term it;) and, in the pre&s;ent day, where do
we &s;ee the father or mother of a family, with
an independent fortune, be it ever &s;o &s;mall,
who would not be &s;hocked at the bare idea of
placing their daughter in the world in &s;uch
&s;ituations as would enable them to ri&s;e, through
their own indu&s;try and merit, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">it them for
becoming wives to &s;ome hone&s;t and indu&s;trious
trade&s;man?&mdash;No: that would be a degrada|tion
which mu&s;t not take place. It is the eti|quette
of the times for the daughters to be bred
fine ladies, although it be without a fortune,
either dependent or independent, to &s;upport it.
As for trade, that is out of the que&s;tion. The
&s;ons indeed are differently provided: the el|de&s;t,
<PB N="90" REF="90">
in cour&s;e, inherits the paternal e&s;tate
and the younger ones are placed in the church
the army, the navy, or at the bar; and others
again are genteelly &s;ituated in the mercantile
world: the whole of which are fit profe&s;&s;ions
for a gentleman, and by which, if they have
merit and &s;ucce&s;s, they may acquire a com|petency.</P>
<P>But for the female part of the family, what
appears in their favour? what pro&s;pects have
they in life?&mdash;The parents die, and leave
them, without a provi&s;ion, a burden upon
their connections; which forms the fir&s;t &s;tep
to deprive them of friends as well as &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.
A mi&s;erable inheritance, to be their
be&s;t and only portion! What can be &s;aid in
behalf of &s;uch parents? can their ea&s;y compli|ance
with the fa&s;hion of the times form any
apology for &s;uch a mi&s;taken conduct?&mdash;This
&s;urely cannot be called true paternal affection,
to entail upon the&s;e helple&s;s young crea|tures
&s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mi&s;ery as mu&s;t even|tually
en&s;ue. Is not this a &s;ufficient definition
of the &s;econd divine commandment, that
"the &s;ins of the father &s;hall de&s;cend to their
<PB N="91" REF="91">
children, to the third and fourth generation."
Which under &s;uch circum&s;tances is ju&s;tly ve|rified;
for, what le&s;s than a miracle can
de&s;troy the entail of mi&s;ery brought upon
helple&s;s innocence, by the &s;ins of their pa|rents?
which, however har&s;h the term, is
wor&s;e than Herod's cruelty; that could only
affect the body, but by a compliance with this
mi&s;taken folly of the day, there is a great
chance of its affecting the &s;oul al&s;o.</P>
<P>What was it brought ruin upon the fir&s;t di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
female, who was admitted into the
Magdalen Charity; and what but a miracle
led her to ta&s;te comfort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a book, entitled The Magdalen, or a Hi&s;tory of the Fir&s;t Penitents received into that charitable A&s;ylum.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>What numbers of helple&s;s and de&s;titute
young women there are, who, &s;eeing them|&s;elves
neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed by their connec|tions,
notwith&s;tanding all the refined and de|licate
ideas which their education and mode of
bringing up have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them with, would
gladly endeavour, through nece&s;&s;ity, to make
up the deficiency of their parents' neglect, by
<PB N="92" REF="92">
putting them&s;elves forward in the world, in
order to obtain a &s;upport. But, alas! to their
&s;orrow, they quickly &s;ee it is not in their
power; for, under their pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces,
"the world is not their friend, nor the
world's laws;" and what was not effected by
their parents, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be obtained by
an inexperienced young woman.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is frequently &s;aid, the female part
of the creation are by far the mo&s;t ready in
cen&s;uring their own &s;ex. But permit me to
a&s;k, would it not be highly reprehen&s;ible in
any lady to countenance even the appearance
of a guilty conduct? By &s;o doing, it is not
only the means of encouraging vice, but mu&s;t
unavoidably incur cen&s;ure upon her&s;elf,
which, above all other misfortunes in life, is
the mo&s;t to be dreaded, &s;ince a female charac|ter,
once lo&s;t, is for ever irretrievable. But, in
ju&s;tice to my own &s;ex, I would gladly hope,
there is not a female, who really con&s;iders the
many horrid mi&s;chiefs which are the attend|ants
upon cen&s;ure, who will ever &s;uffer the
&s;malle&s;t intimation thereof to e&s;cape the
<PB N="93" REF="93">
bounds of her own brea&s;t, unle&s;s through the
mo&s;t flagrant proofs of guilt.</P>
<P>Out of the many, &s;ome there are, no doubt'
who, to colour their own vicious lives, are
ever ready to murder the character of any one,
without taking the &s;malle&s;t thought or concern
as to the con&s;equences, nor even &s;paring the
innocent with any greater degree of lenity than
they would the guilty. But of this cla&s;s we
hope there are but few; for, why &s;hould it
be &s;uppo&s;ed that female objects in di&s;tre&s;s,
particularly tho&s;e who have youth and beauty
on their &s;ide, mu&s;t unavoidably be objects of
contempt rather than pity? From what motive
can this certain part of the &s;ex continue to
load the &s;ufferings of the&s;e poor, helple&s;s wo|men
with reviling and contempt? None other,
mu&s;t repeat it, but to draw a veil over their
own vicious lives; for neither religion nor vir|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ue
ever countenanced &s;o much inju&s;tice. To
cad the poor &s;ufferer with calumny, is cruel
indeed; &s;uffice it, &s;he has to &s;truggle with
the hard&s;hips of penury!</P>
<P>Let them be traced along from the moment
that fate's afflicting hand is &s;tretched out again&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="94">
them: trace them through every &s;tage of life
and then &s;ee if they are not the mo&s;t pitiab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of all mortals! Then, how can the time of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
opulent part of the &s;ex be better employed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
in &s;earching into the &s;ource of their &s;orrow
and endeavouring to obtain redre&s;s? To in
ve&s;tigate the cau&s;e will be &s;peak a remedy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
at hand. But for a continuation of the va|rious
di&s;tre&s;&s;es which poor females are &s;ubject
to, we need but take a general review, an
repre&s;ent the ca&s;e as it evidently is, which
will &s;ave the unplea&s;ant ta&s;k of u&s;ing names:
for, it is to be feared, few there are who have
any knowledge of life, but can rea&s;on upon
this &s;ubject, if not through fatal &s;elf-expe|rience,
yet through experimental ob&s;ervations
on others. For example: how often do we
&s;ee whole families entirely ruined by the im|proper
conduct of a hu&s;band or father, who,
through giving way to &s;ome predominant vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">,
at once overwhelms the whole of his family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
ruin and di&s;tre&s;s, or, at lea&s;t, the female <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
of it, who, not being able to defend them&s;elves,
or &s;eek redre&s;s, are liable to every misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">
How far the wife was intended to be the
&s;lave to her hu&s;band, I know not, but certain
we are, &s;he was de&s;igned to be his friend, his
companion, and united part; or, according
to the gentlemen's phra&s;e, his <HI>better part;</HI>
and yet how often do we &s;ee her &s;inking un|der
the burden of a hou&s;ehold load, whil&s;t the
unfeeling hu&s;band is lavi&s;hing away the &s;ub|&s;tance
which ought to be for the comfort and
&s;upport of a family? Yet &s;uch unnatural be|ings
there are, who, by giving way to &s;ome
unlawful pa&s;&s;ion, can, without &s;cruple or re|mor&s;e,
trample under foot all laws, divine
and human, and with impunity bring wretch|edne&s;s
upon tho&s;e he is bound to &s;upport:
notwith&s;tanding St. Paul tells us, "if any one
provide not for his own, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e
of his own hou&s;e, he hath denied the faith,
and is wor&s;e than an infidel."</P>
<P>Let us but look at the many unhappy
females, who come to ruin through merce|nary
marriages. How many are the in&s;tances
of young women, who have been brought up
in affluence, and reared with all the tender
care and attention, which are in the power

of maternal affection to be&s;tow; yet, perhaps,
through her youthful follies and credulity, &s;he
is led away by the artifice and fal&s;e preten&s;ions
of one of the&s;e mercenary men, on whom &s;he
cheerfully be&s;tows her patrimony, whether
acquired by inheritance, or the &s;miles of for|tune
upon the hone&s;t indu&s;try of her decea&s;ed
parents, avails not, for her expected happi|ne&s;s
is vani&s;hed in empty air, and &s;he is quick|ly

<P>As leading to a further explanation, let us
repre&s;ent a ca&s;e which very frequently hap|pens.
A gentleman's daughter, one of the&s;e
well-bred young ladies, which was &s;poken of at
the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e; or be it a
trade&s;man's daughter, it matters not, they be|ing
equally trained up in the &s;ame liberal plan
of female education, married to a re&s;pectable
and worthy trade&s;man, who, we will &s;ay, ac|cording
to the common run of the times, has
<PB N="97" REF="97">
made choice of a very proper partner for &s;u|perintending
the dome&s;tic concerns of his
hou&s;ehold, and conducting a table with ta&s;te;
which, according to the beau monde, mu&s;t un|doubtedly
be complied with, &s;ince his credit
in trade &s;o greatly depends upon appearances;
and however great may be his di&s;like to the
practice, yet <HI>he</HI> it is that is ab&s;olutely obliged
to comply with the cu&s;tom of the times, and
make a figure in life, in order to &s;upport the
credit of his trade; a precedent big with every
evil con&s;equence, yet he mu&s;t comply, and act
like his neighbour, if he expects to receive
neighbour's fare. Therefore, before we cen|&s;ure
or condemn &s;uch conduct in any one
individual, let us, if you plea&s;e, place choice
and nece&s;&s;ity in the &s;cales of ju&s;tice, and &s;ee
which will preponderate.</P>
<P>I recollect an ob&s;ervation upon this &s;ubject
&s;ome time ago, made by a noble and very
learned man, the Earl of&mdash;. Says his lord|&s;hip,
"it is the trade&s;man and mechanic who
are under the nece&s;&s;ity of making a figure in
life, in order to catch notice and obtain credit
in their line of bu&s;ine&s;s." But, continued his
<PB N="98" REF="98">
lord&s;hip, "for &s;uch as me there is no oc|ca&s;ion,
and con&s;equently we can &s;ave whil&s;t
they are obliged to &s;pend: we can live as we
plea&s;e, dre&s;s as we plea&s;e, and, in fine, act as
we plea&s;e; for our independence and ance&s;try
will always command re&s;pect, and enable us
to do as we like."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I thought it was a hard ca&s;e,
that &s;o many &s;en&s;ible, clever men, of an infe|rior
cla&s;s, with regard to pecuniary matters,
&s;hould ab&s;olutely be held down for what was
not a fault; but, after a moment's con&s;idera|tion,
I could not help joining in the validity
of his lord&s;hip's opinion. Although I knew,
at the &s;ame time, his lord&s;hip was frequently
ridiculed for the meanne&s;s of his table and
dre&s;s; yet, it occurred to me, that <HI>did not</HI>
era&s;e any names from his lord&s;hip's rent-roll;
though the &s;ame conduct might occa&s;ion a
great deficiency in a trade&s;man's ledger.</P>
<P>In fine, need we advance any further than
Change-alley for a confirmation, that it is in
compliance with evil cu&s;toms, and a confor|mity
to de&s;tructive precedent, that bring on
&s;uch a train of misfortunes, with the greate&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="99">
force, which is &s;ure to fall where there is the
lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance? How frequent and &s;udden
are the fluctuations in the &s;tocks, owing to the
artifices of &s;tock-jobbers, under &s;ome fal&s;e
pretence or other: notwith&s;tanding it is a
practice &s;o highly dete&s;ted, both by govern|ment
and the generality of the parties con|cerned,
yet appearances take the lead; &s;o that,
however wrong the practice, &s;ince the trade&s;|man
finds the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of acting like
his neighbour, no doubt but a generous public
will either point out an expedient, or ab&s;olve
<HI>him,</HI> at lea&s;t, from cen&s;ure, let the con&s;e|quence
prove how it may. Pope &s;ays.</P>
<Q><L>"True con&s;ciencious honour is to feel no &s;in,</L>
<L>"He's arm'd without that's innocent within:"</L></Q>
<P>and very ju&s;tly &s;o, <HI>with regard</HI> to men; but
for poor women, the weight of all the&s;e griev|ances
mu&s;t unavoidably re&s;t upon them, as the
weake&s;t &s;ex; who, having &s;truggled through
the labyrinth of misfortunes, no &s;ooner arrive
at the gate of indu&s;try, viz. <HI>female occupa|tions,</HI>
than they find it &s;hut, and men, &s;o much
&s;tronger, and in power, the porters at the door.
<PB N="100" REF="100">
So, begging pardon for the digre&s;&s;ion, we will
leave the&s;e poor unfortunate women at the gate,
and peeping through the wicket to no effect,
till we proceed with our young couple, who
journey on a few years through this maze of
life, a life that &s;eems calculated for felicity,
happy in each other, and ble&s;&s;ed with a ri&s;ing
progeny, which, in cour&s;e becomes the mo|ther's
care, whil&s;t the father, attentive to the
intere&s;t of his family, endeavours to extend
his trade for the mutual advantage of all; and
thus tied with the &s;ilken bands of unity, they
pa&s;s their days in one continued round of
bli&s;s, actuated by the amiable endearments of
the affectionate father, the fond hu&s;band, and
the generous friend. But, alas! how fre|quently
does the malice of fate un&s;een, pur|&s;ue,
and often bla&s;t, the happine&s;s of human
enjoyments.</P>
<Q><L>"Ah gentle pair! ye little think how nigh</L>

<P>Next, let us &s;uppo&s;e, which &s;uppo&s;ition too
is frequently realized, that the father of this
happy family. whom we have ju&s;t left in the
&s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, and in the full enjoy|ment
of conjugal and paternal bli&s;s, is &s;natch|ed
away by the hand of death, and leaves his
di&s;con&s;olate widow, in the meridian of her
days, &s;urrounded by her innocent offspring, who
mu&s;t now look up to her alone for protection,
which even her&s;elf may &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>How keen, how poignant mu&s;t be her grief
at &s;uch a &s;eparation, when, at once, &s;he is
robbed of a tender hu&s;band, and her children
of an indulgent father! Yet, like a true
Chri&s;tian, &s;he endeavours to arm her&s;elf with
&s;uch fortitude as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport her in
the time of trial; and by the help of rea&s;on
and religion, &s;he begins to revive, and &s;latters
her&s;elf with new hopes, in the many comforts
&s;he is to receive from her darling children.</P>
<P>Short-fighted mortal! &s;he now begins to
take new courage, from having &s;ubdued her
&s;tubborn heart to &s;ubmit, as &s;he thinks, to her
greate&s;t affliction; which, alas! is no more
than a prelude to her future misfortunes: for
<PB N="102" REF="102">
her late hu&s;band's concerns come next to be ad|ju&s;ted,
when it is found there is a very &s;mall
provi&s;ion, if any, left for her&s;elf and helple&s;s
children: for the decea&s;ed hu&s;band, having
been under the nece&s;&s;ity of deceiving the
world by the vile pretext of appearances, has
now involved his family in the unavoidable
nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeing the world had deceived
him; the dreadful con&s;equences of which they
are now left to &s;truggle with. The&s;e are real
trials: yet how frequently do they happen!
and now, at once, are all her expectations of
future happine&s;s bla&s;ted; an intervening cloud
has darkened the &s;cene, and that maternal
triumph which u&s;ed to gladden the face of the
fond mother, is now done away by the dark
gloom of adver&s;ity; and her &s;orrows are like
the impetuous torrent. A family, brought up
and educated with the idea of being gentlemen
and ladies, who have ju&s;t been figuring away
in the gaieties of life, to find them&s;elves en|tangled
in a wilderne&s;s of mi&s;ery, without
money, and con&s;equently without friends, or
any means of &s;upport, requires more than hu|man
&s;trength to combat; for, in &s;uch a me|lancholy
<PB N="103" REF="103">
&s;ituation, independent of real want,
the &s;truggles of reluctant nature are not ea&s;y
to &s;uppre&s;s. The parent, the virtuous and
tender mother, &s;ees her darling offspring, with
all their innocence about them, upon the
verge of de&s;truction, ye&s;terday, in the full en|joyment
of all the happine&s;s this world can
be&s;tow, and to-day turned ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t into the wide
world, attended with all tho&s;e fine and delicate
feelings which nature, education, and a pious
example could be&s;tow. Yet, all cannot &s;ave
them from the cruel hand of fate, the die is
ca&s;t, and they mu&s;t now bid adieu to the com|forts
of life, and plunge forward in an ocean
of mi&s;ery; for&punc; by this time, their &s;mall fund
being nearly, if not quite, exhau&s;ted, the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
mother finds the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of
making her unhappy &s;ituation known to &s;ome
relation, or former acquaintance, which &s;he
had u&s;ed to call friend. But, alas! &s;he has
yet to learn, the world in general takes but
little concern for the fate of individuals, and
too oft, will &s;ooner upbraid than relieve di&s;|tre&s;s;
and &s;o precarious is the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
friend&s;hip, that, <HI>in general,</HI> on the approach of
<PB N="104" REF="104">
di&s;tre&s;s, it di&s;&s;olves like &s;now under the rays of
the &s;un, or evaporates, like ether, at the ap|proach

there are, who, in pro&s;perity, u&s;ed to extol her
conduct; and are, perhaps, at the very moment
decking out them&s;elves, table, and family after
her example, and yet can be the fir&s;t to brand
her name with obloquy.</P>
<P>O, cruel cen&s;ure, are not the pangs of di&s;|tre&s;s
and poverty enough to bear! is this
Chri&s;tian charity! is this acting the part of the
good Samaritan! Yet, yet, it is pa&s;t di&s;pute,
that &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s does afflicted poverty expe|rience,
although the cordial of friend&s;hip, and
the benevolent &s;ympathy of fellow mortals
would &s;o very much alleviate: however, by
woeful experience, beginning to &s;ee the world
in its true colours, &s;he fees her only re&s;ource
is in the con&s;olation of religion, and in an hum|ble
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Divine Will; and with
this &s;hield, &s;he endeavours to guard her&s;elf
and innocent &s;uffering offspring from the
impending, &s;torm which appears ready to
bur&s;t upon their unfortunate heads. Still
their pious and laudable endeavours will
<PB N="105" REF="105">
not alone &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ity of extreme
want; they are mortal, and con&s;equently both
nature and duty pre&s;s hard upon the un|happy
mother, to look into the world for a
means of &s;upport; for now every pro&s;pect of
happine&s;s to her future days is blackened
by anxious care, and, perhaps, at a period
which might have been expected the happie&s;t
of her life: but &s;ince adver&s;ity has taught
her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;he finds &s;he has to climb
up the &s;leep of difficulty, with her children
dragging after her like &s;o many clogs at her
feet, to retard her progre&s;s, her fir&s;t &s;tep is to
look out for &s;ituations for her &s;ons, to whom
Providence having denied an education, &s;o as
to command &s;uch &s;ituations in life as the ge|nerality
of men are enabled to look up to, and
without the aid of connections, or friends, to
lead them out into the world; if the poor mo|ther
can obtain for them a &s;ituation at the
back of a counter, it is the highe&s;t &s;tep in life
which &s;he can &s;ue for, <HI>or expect; and &s;uch as
the&s;e,</HI> indeed, are an exception as to filling
women's occupations; for, if nothing el&s;e pre|&s;ents,
what are they to do? But for the poor
<PB N="106" REF="106">
mother, who perhaps has not yet attained
her thirty-fifth year, and her &s;till unfortunate
daughters, what is there in their favour? with|out
money, friends, character, or means of in|du&s;try,
they are unavoidably doomed to wretch|edne&s;s,
if any thing on earth can be wretch|ed,
notwith&s;tanding her utmo&s;t exertions, as
well as her pious and exemplary conduct to
her children, who not in&s;en&s;ible to her merit,
endeavour to &s;oothe her &s;orrows by their ten|der
regard and fond affections.</P>
<P>Alas! what can they do, they all &s;eem to
look up to the poor mother for aid, who I as
it not in her power even to help her&s;elf. She
now takes a &s;erious retro&s;pect of her pa&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ie,

to make way for a &s;et of beings who are much

Panton-&s;treet we were acco&s;ted by an unfortu|nate
woman, who fir&s;t &s;olicited our charity in
Engli&s;h; but overhearing us, in our progre&s;s
&s;peak French, &s;he renewed her &s;uit in that
language, probably thinking we might be fo|reigners,
and therefore did not under&s;tand the
nature of her fir&s;t application. You will own,
it is by no means a&s;toni&s;hing, that hearing an
Engli&s;h mendicant, <HI>e&s;pecially a female,</HI> beg in
different languages &s;hould excite our admira|tion,
particularly as &s;he &s;poke both fluently and
elegantly, the evident re&s;ult of a liberal educa|tion.</P>
<P>Under this idea, we li&s;tened to her petition
delivered in French, which, being now &s;o
common an acqui&s;ition, made us de&s;irous of
knowing whether her learning was confined to
that tongue only; my friend, therefore, re|plied
to her in Italian, and we were not a lit|tle
&s;urpri&s;ed to find her not only mi&s;tre&s;s of
that language, but al&s;o well ver&s;ed in Latin.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114">
Shocked to di&s;cover &s;uch exten&s;ive learn|ing

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and conceiving her an object of the
greate&s;t pity, probably abandoned by unfeel|ing,
&s;ordid relations, we delayed not in&s;tantly
affording her &s;ome temporary relief; but in
the moment of &s;o doing, I was &s;o unfortunate
as to be recognized by my parents, who were
returning from a friend's hou&s;e, where they
had &s;upped. In &s;uch a place, at &s;uch an hour,
and with a female, what could be thought?
We were immediately adjudged criminal;
and, upon our joining them, were accordingly
reproached, as if their &s;u&s;picions had been
true. Such is the power of prejudice, that
it was in vain we prote&s;ted our innocence, in
vain we informed them of the nature of our
conver&s;ation with this woman; the&s;e availed
us nothing: we were not only cen&s;ured for the
immorality of the affair it&s;elf, but al&s;o de&s;pi&s;ed
for the meanne&s;s and vulgarity of our ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, what tends to confirm
them in this their premature opinion, is the

<P>Suppo&s;ing, or even admitting, this poor
unfortunate woman to be one of the wretched
tribe, of whom we have been &s;peaking. is it
not evident, her education was not calculated
either for beggary or vice? Nor can it be
&s;uppo&s;ed, from the di&s;tre&s;s which always
&s;eems attendant upon this abject &s;tate of beg|gary
alone, that it can be by choice preferred
to &s;ome laudable and reputable employment.
No: it is not in nature.</P>
<P>Then, in the name of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and
truth, permit me to a&s;k, from whence origi|nates,
and what is it that countenances, the
cau&s;e of all the&s;e evils? Are they incurable?
Are not women, by nature, of a more gentle
and delicate compo&s;ition than men, and le&s;s
able to bear the hard&s;hips which &s;o frequent|ly
are forced upon them? Has it not, in
all ages, been the ta&s;k, or rather the avowed
choice, of the male part of the creation, to
protect and defend the weaker &s;ex? and is not
the male part of the creation better able to
<PB N="117" REF="117">
bear cold, hunger, fatigue, and hard&s;hips than
women are? Poor helple&s;s women! who no
&s;ooner meet the heavy fate of indigence, than,
from their appearance, they are bound to &s;up|port
a load of infamous cen&s;ure along with it.</P>
<P>Although, at the &s;ame time, permit me to
infer, there is not the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for men to
undergo the &s;malle&s;t part of the&s;e hand&s;hips,
even bad they relinqui&s;hed their claim to wo|men's
occupations, &s;ince there is &s;uch a num|ber
of branches in trade, be&s;ide arts and &s;ci|ences,
which are only calculated for men.
Surely, then, women ought to be permitted to
occupy the remaining few, nor any longer
&s;uffered to be bound down by the&s;e oppre&s;|&s;ive
chains; for, does not generous Pity de|mand
a hearing in their behalf? Does not
common decency forbid they &s;hould be in&s;ult|ed
in the manner they are? Is it manly, is it
noble, is it generous, or humane? Would
not one think, from &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ions, that
men had determined to exert them&s;elves for
the mi&s;ery and torture of their fellow-crea|tures.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118">

reply: I do not pre&s;ume to in&s;truct the learn|ed,
but &s;imply to communicate my ideas; for,
a complicated bu&s;ine&s;s like this, which has
taken &s;o deep root, requires a greater know|ledge
in human affairs to di&s;cu&s;s than the

of the cau&s;es which facilitate or ob|&s;truct

requi&s;ite, which di&s;covers the many
convincing rea&s;ons why a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much
con&s;equence &s;hould be properly inve&s;tigated;
and, upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, as all things,
whether great or &s;mall, mu&s;t have a beginning,
I have taken &s;ome pains to be informed as to
the nature of the &s;ubject. But as it is not ex|pected
a female can have much knowledge in
judicature, I go upon the grounds of common
&s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, and not actuated by any
other motive than a wi&s;h to &s;ee happine&s;s pre|vail,
I &s;hall accordingly beg leave to proceed
to the following con&s;iderations; for, as in the
e&s;timation and choice of things, it is always
granted we are to prefer better to wor&s;e, and
<PB N="120" REF="120">
&s;uch things as are grounded in rea&s;on, to
others that hold no compari&s;on therewith:
we will, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e the very wor&s;t &s;up|po&s;ition
on which the argument can be found|ed,
which is, What are this body of men to
do, or how are they to be di&s;po&s;ed of, if de|prived
of their pre&s;ent employment? Which
may be briefly an&s;wered:</P>
<P>That although there may be &s;ome men, like
women, of a timorous di&s;po&s;ition, and thereby
may experience &s;ome inconveniencies, yet it is
not po&s;&s;ible the whole body of them can &s;uf|fer,
by rea&s;on that, as I before ob&s;erved, men
can turn them&s;elves &s;o many ways in the
world, which, were a woman to attempt, &s;he
would be pointed at as ridiculous and frantic:
independent of which, after having &s;tated the
heavy grievances under which, not only the female
part of the creation are oppre&s;&s;ed, but the
community in general, it may ju&s;tly be replied,
that no man, or body of men can, in rea&s;on,
lay claim to a privilege that is ab&s;olutely re|pugnant
to all civil &s;ociety: after which, will
not all other rea&s;ons appear to have little
weight? In other ca&s;es, has it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ad any weight
<PB N="121" REF="121">
with the police of the country? How many
repeated in&s;tances have we &s;een of men, and
even bodies of men, who, by certain obliga|tions,
have been obliged to give up public or
private property, when a general good could
not be otherwi&s;e obtained?</P>
<P>Then, why is there any di&s;tinction to be
made between relinqui&s;hing property and pri|vilege,
when the public good requires it,
which in all exigencies mu&s;t confe&s;&s;edly be
ju&s;t? for, if change of circum&s;tances were to
have no weight with the legi&s;lature in direct|ing
human affairs, what would the intercour&s;e
of mankind end in, but contention between
private intere&s;t and public good? But &s;o long
as we are ble&s;&s;ed with a happy con&s;titution,
and rulers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing humanity united with
wi&s;dom, what have we to fear?</P>
<P>Were the de&s;ire of procuring liberty or hap|pine&s;s
for this, or any other &s;et of people, at
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">azard of injuring the community, or any
part of it, the reque&s;t would not only be un|rea&s;onable
but unju&s;t: but after &s;umming up,
under each re&s;pective head, all the evidences
I have collected, with a very gentle hint at the
<PB N="122" REF="122">
enormous expence, as well as danger, and
other inconveniencies attending a continuance
of this precedent, and con&s;idering the many
great advantages which would accrue, not only
to the community, but to them&s;elves, by en|gaging
in more manly employments, I &s;hall
leave the impartial reader to draw the conclu|&s;ion,
and re&s;t the ba&s;is of my ob&s;ervatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
with tho&s;e in power, for there are few, if any,
precedents of arbitrary commitments, except
the one in que&s;tion, which have not come un|der
the watchful eye of the legi&s;lature, who&s;e
vigilance and impartiality have, at all times,
been a &s;trong barrier and &s;hield again&s;t any in|fringements
upon the rights and privileges of
the Briti&s;h nation; and, I pre&s;ume, an inve&s;ti|gation
into the grievances of the&s;e poor &s;uf|fering
females will quickly be a means of
doing away the precedent of encouraging, or
countenancing, effeminate trade&s;men, which, it
is evident, are not only the origin of &s;uch un|heard
of di&s;tre&s;&s;es to poor helple&s;s females,
and preventing parents, who may be de&s;irous
of breaking through the fa&s;hions of the
times, from placing their daughters to trades,
<PB N="123" REF="123">
but is ab&s;olutely leading to the di&s;&s;olution of
all good government.</P>
<P>Nor is there the &s;malle&s;t danger, when once
the bu&s;ine&s;s is commenced, that the deep pe|netration
and humanity of the guardians of the
common weal will ever be baffled in &s;o lauda|ble
a pur&s;uit. For, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ub|tlety
of the enemy of mankind may invent a
number of fal&s;e and artful rea&s;onings, yet
what will all that avail, when the curtain is
drawn a&s;ide, for then the &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and
retribution is to be no longer appea&s;ed by
&s;uch artifice; for neither law nor equity will
admit of mending their fortunes by fraud or
violence. And, although &s;ome of the offen|&s;ive
body may endeavour, by little artful chi|can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ry,
to glo&s;s over their crimes, and endea|vour
to palliate them with idle excu&s;es, yet
the only real plea the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive traders can
make, being that of private intere&s;t, as I be|fore
ob&s;erved, it has at all times been judici|ou&s;ly
ordered to be given up for a public good.</P>
<P>What can po&s;&s;ibly be deemed a more effi|cacious
good, than to relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed,
and pre&s;erve &s;o many poor mi&s;erable &s;ouls
<PB N="124" REF="124">
from perdition. Yet it is greatly to be feared
the&s;e con&s;iderations to men, who are grown
torpid by cu&s;tom, or blind by ignorance, will
give but little room for reflection.</P>
<P>Have we not every rea&s;on to believe, to the
di&s;grace of &s;uch part of the community as
call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, that there are &s;ome,
though we will hope but a &s;mall part, who&s;e
hearts are too much contracted and bound
down by avarice, to admit of any humane &s;en|&s;ations,
which, in a quarter of the globe,
where the refinements of the age are cried up
by all nations, is unaccountably &s;trange; for,
in a &s;crupulous &s;earch for facts, which con|firms
the writer's opinion on this &s;ubject, cer|tain
it is, there is not a &s;ingle page in the New
Te&s;tament which does not explicitly, or on
the faire&s;t inference, condemn &s;uch conduct,
either by the example or precepts of Chri&s;t
and his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ince the&s;e men have become apo&s;tates
from Chri&s;tianity, why any longer &s;uffer their
arbitrary power to be a &s;ubterfuge for fraud
and oppre&s;&s;ion? Let the falutary laws of
Great Britain provide means for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="125" REF="125">
a precedent, which, through time and unfore|&s;een
events, has become productive of &s;o
much mi&s;chief. Or let them appear and
&s;hew cau&s;e, why they are entitled to oppre&s;s
the&s;e poor women, in order to enjoy indo|lence
and ea&s;e. And let their claims to the
flagrant violation of the rights of our fair
countrywomen be developed.</P>
<P>Although, at the &s;ame time, permit me to
infer, I cannot flatter my&s;elf the&s;e modes of
proceeding are expected entirely to eradicate
the &s;in again&s;t the &s;eventh commandment.
But, from the prodigious numbers, which are
by compul&s;ion driven to the paths of wicked|ne&s;s,
will it not be a means of &s;aving thou|&s;ands
of mi&s;erable creatures from &s;in and &s;or|row,
and enable magi&s;trates, and men in pow|er,
to exerci&s;e ju&s;tice and authority over the
wicked, without fear of puni&s;hing the innocent
with the guilty? for, believe me, it is not the
incorrigible &s;inner I take upon me to commi|&s;erate,
but the encouraged, or rather the com|pelled,
&s;inner; and &s;till more tho&s;e who &s;uffer
in innocence, which is the haple&s;s, wretched
fate of thou&s;ands. And although I cannot recal
<PB N="126" REF="126">
to my memory the trifling ob&s;ervations I have
made on this occa&s;ion, I am con&s;cious they are
my real &s;entiments; and flatter my&s;elf, however
bad the compo&s;ition, the de&s;ign will be adopt|ed
by the generous and humane; when there is
not a doubt, but the heavy burden, which the&s;e
children of mi&s;ery have &s;o long &s;upported,
will quickly be thrown off, and the &s;tumbling
block to virtue and happine&s;s be rolled away.</P>
<P>Have we not had &s;ufficient proofs, that the
happine&s;s and welfare of mortals have at all
times been thought worthy the attention of
a Briton. Witne&s;s the poor &s;laves; wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
exertions have not been u&s;ed by the humane
friends of liberty in their behalf? Yet le&s;s,
much le&s;s, are their &s;ufferings to be lamented
than the poor females I &s;peak of, who have
been bred up and educated in the &s;chool of
Chri&s;tianity, and fo&s;tered by the tender hand
of Care.</P>
<P>The &s;lave is little acquainted with the &s;e|vere
pangs a virtuous mind labours under,
when driven to the extreme nece&s;&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or|feiting

who has received a refined, if not a
cla&s;&s;ical, education, and is capable of the fine&s;t
feelings the human heart is &s;u&s;ceptible of. A
&s;lave, through want of education, has little
more refinement than cattle in the field; nor
can they know the want of what they never
enjoyed, or were taught to expect; but a poor
female, who has received the be&s;t in&s;truction,
and is endowed with a good under&s;tanding,
what mu&s;t not &s;he feel in mind, independent
of her corporeal wants, after the adver&s;ity of

the cen&s;ure, and contempt of the world?
Her feelings cannot be de&s;cribed, nor her &s;uf|ferings

<P>"There is," &s;aid the honourable gentle|man,
"no &s;tate in human nature but had its
compen&s;ations. What was a &s;lave? a happy
&s;lave was a degraded man; his happine&s;s con|&s;i&s;ted
in having no thought of the pa&s;t, or the

<P>A very &s;triking and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, with

I cannot but differ in opinion, when it is &s;aid,
that all mankind are capable of a compen&s;a|tion.
For, admitting the &s;ame mode of rea|&s;oning
to &s;tand good, if the oppre&s;&s;ions of one
part of the creation are moderated through
their ignorance, how much mu&s;t the other be
heightened by their &s;en&s;ibility and the refine|ments

<P>Then, if an inve&s;tigation into the bu&s;ine&s;s of

to patronize the poor, unfortunate women of
our own nation, who labour under the very
wor&s;t kind of &s;lavery, and mu&s;t continue to
langui&s;h under the fetters of a painful bondage,
till death, or the kindly hand of interference,
has &s;evered the chain?</P>

him, a genteel po&s;t under government.
My mother died when I was but twelve years
<PB N="132" REF="132">
old, and my father, who was exce&s;&s;ively fond
of me, determined to be him&s;elf my preceptor,
and to take care that my natural genius, which
his partiality made him think above the com|mon
rank, &s;hould not want the improvements
of a liberal education.</P>
<P>He was a man of &s;en&s;e, with a tolerable
&s;hare of learning. In his youth he had been
a free liver, and, perhaps, for that rea&s;on took
&s;ome pains to become a free thinker. But
whatever fa&s;hionable frailties he might former|ly
have allowed in him&s;elf, he was now in ad|vanced
life, and had, at lea&s;t, worldly wi&s;dom
enough to know, that it was nece&s;&s;ary his
daughter &s;hould be re&s;trained from tho&s;e liber|ties,
which he had looked upon as trifling
errors in his own conduct. He therefore la|boured
with great application to inculcate in
me the love of order, the beauty of moral recti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ule,
and the happine&s;s and &s;elf-reward of
virtue; but, at the &s;ame time, profe&s;&s;ed it his
de&s;ign to free my mind from vulgar prejudices
and &s;uper&s;tition, for &s;o he called revealed re|ligion.
As I was urged to chu&s;e virtue and
reject vice, from motives which had no nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="133" REF="133">
connection with immortality. I was not
led to con&s;ider a future &s;tate either with hope
or fear. My father, indeed, when I urged
him upon that &s;ubject, always intimated that
the doctrine of immortality, whether true or
fal&s;e, ought not at all to influence my con|duct,
or interrupt my peace, becau&s;e the vir|tue
which &s;ecured happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate, would al&s;o &s;ecure it in a future &s;tate: a
future &s;tate, therefore, I wholly di&s;regarded,
and, to confe&s;s the truth, di&s;believed: for I
thought I could plainly di&s;cover, that it was
di&s;believed by my father, though he had not
thought fit explicitly to declare his &s;entiments.
As I had no very turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, a ductile
and good di&s;po&s;ition, and the highe&s;t reverence
for his under&s;tanding, as well as the tendere&s;t
affection for him, he found it an ea&s;y talk to
make me adopt every &s;entiment and opinion
which he propo&s;ed to me, as his own, e&s;pe|cially
as he took care to &s;upport his principles
by the authority and arguments of the be&s;t
writers again&s;t Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty, I was called upon to
make u&s;e of all the philo&s;ophy I had been
<PB N="134" REF="134">
taught, by his death; which not only deprived
me of a parent I mo&s;t ardently loved, but
with him of all the ea&s;e and affluence to
which I had been accu&s;tomed. His income
was only for life, and he had rather lived be|yond
than within it; con&s;equently, there was
nothing left for me, but the pride and help|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
of genteel life, a ta&s;te for every thing
elegant, and a delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility that has
doubled my &s;ufferings. In this di&s;tre&s;s, a
brother of my mother's, who was grown rich
in trade, received me into his hou&s;e, and de|clared
he would take the &s;ame care of me as if
I had been his own. When the fir&s;t tran&s;ports
of my grief were abated, I found my&s;elf in an
ea&s;y &s;ituation, and from the natural cheerful|ne&s;s
of my temper, I was beginning once
more to ta&s;te of happine&s;s. My uncle, who
was a man of narrow under&s;tanding and illibe|ral
education, was a little di&s;gu&s;ted with me
for employing &s;o much of my time in read|ing;
but &s;till more &s;o, when happening to
examine my books, he found, by the titles,
that &s;ome of them were what he called bla&s;|phemy,
and tended, as he imagined, to make me
<PB N="135" REF="135">
me an athei&s;t. I endeavoured to explain my
principles, which I thought beneath the dig|nity
of virtue to di&s;gui&s;e or di&s;avow; but
as I never could make him conceive any dif|ference
between a dei&s;t and an athei&s;t, my ar|guments
only &s;erved to confirm him in the
opinion, that I was a wicked wretch, who, in
his own phra&s;e, believed neither God nor de|vil,
As he was really a good man, and hear|tily
zealous for the e&s;tabli&s;hed faith, though
more from habit and prejudice than rea&s;on,
my errors gave him great affliction. I per|ceived
it with the utmo&s;t concern; I perceiv|ed
too, that he looked upon me with a degree
of abhorrence mixed with pity, and that I was
wholly indebted to his good nature for that
protection, which I had flattered my&s;elf I
&s;hould owe to his love. I comforted my&s;elf,
however, with my own integrity, and even
felt a con&s;cious pride, in &s;uffering this per&s;e|cution
from ignorance and folly, only becau&s;e
I was &s;uperior to vulgar errors and popular
&s;uper&s;tition. And that Chri&s;tianity de&s;erved
the&s;e appellations, I was not more convinced
by my father's arguments, than my uncle's
<PB N="136" REF="136">
conduct, who, as his zeal was not according
to knowledge, was by no means qualified to
"adorn the doctrine which he profe&s;&s;ed to be|lieve."</P>
<P>I had lived a few months under the painful
&s;en&s;ibility of receiving continual benefits from
a per&s;on who&s;e e&s;teem and affection I had lo&s;t,
when my uncle one day come into my cham|ber,
and after preparing me for &s;ome unex|pected
good fortune, told me, he had ju&s;t had
a propo&s;al of marriage for me, from a man to
whom I could not po&s;&s;ibly have any objec|tion.
He then named a merchant with whom
I had often been in company at his table. As
the man was neither old nor ugly, had a large
fortune, and a fair character, my uncle
thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently authori&s;ed to pro|nounce
as he did, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly
have any objection to him. An objection,
however, I had, which I told my uncle was
to me in&s;uperable; it was, that the per&s;on
whom he propo&s;ed to me as the companion,
the guide, and director of my whole life, to
whom I was to vow, not only obedience, but
love, had nothing in him that could ever en|gage
<PB N="137" REF="137">
my affection: his under&s;tanding was low,
his &s;entiments mean and indelicate, and his
manner unpolite and unplea&s;ing. "What
&s;tuff is all this?" interrupted my uncle, "&s;en|timents
indelicate, unpolite, his under&s;tand|ing
for&s;ooth, not equal to your own! Ah!
child, if you had le&s;s romance, conceit, and
arrogance, and more true di&s;cretion and pru|dence,
it would do you more good than all the
fine books you have confounded your poor
head with, and, what is wor&s;e, perhaps, ruin|ed
your poor &s;oul. I own it went a little
again&s;t my con&s;cience to accept my hone&s;t
friend's kind offer, and give him &s;uch a pagan
for a wife. But I know not, whether the
believing hu&s;band may not convert the unbe|lieving
wife? As to your &s;lighty objections,
they are &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, that I wonder you
can &s;uppo&s;e me fool enough to be deceived
by them. No, child, wife as you are, you
cannot impo&s;e upon a man who has lived as
many years in the world as I have. I &s;ee your
motive; you have &s;ome in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">idel libertine rake in
your eye, with whom you would go headlong
to perdition. But I &s;hall take care to have
<PB N="138" REF="138">
your &s;oul to an&s;wer for, as well as your per|&s;on.
Either I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of you to an hone&s;t
man that may convert you, or you &s;hall di&s;po&s;e
of your&s;elf how you plea&s;e for me; for I di&s;|claim
all farther care or trouble about you.
So I leave you to con&s;ider, whether or no the
kindne&s;s I have &s;hewn you, entitles me to
&s;ome little influence over you, and whether
you chu&s;e to &s;eek protection where you can
find it, or accept of the happy lot Providence
has cut out for you."</P>
<P>He left me at the clo&s;e of this fine harangue,
and I &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et my&s;elf to con&s;ider, as he
bade me, which of the two &s;tates he had &s;et
before me, I ought to chu&s;e.&mdash;To &s;ubmit to
a legal &s;ort of pro&s;titution, with the additional
weight of perjury on my con&s;cience, or to
expo&s;e my&s;elf to all the di&s;tre&s;s of friendle&s;s
poverty and unprotected youth. After &s;ome
hours of deliberation, I determined on the
latter, and that more from principle than in|clination;
for, though my delicacy would
have &s;uffered extremely in accepting a hu&s;|band,
at lea&s;t indifferent to me, yet as my
heart was perfectly di&s;engaged, and my tem|per
<PB N="139" REF="139">
naturally ea&s;y, I thought I could have
been le&s;s unhappy in following my uncle's
advice than I might probably be by rejecting
it. But then I mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted to an ac|tion
I could not think ju&s;tifiable, in order to
avoid mere external di&s;tre&s;&s;es. This would
not have been philo&s;ophical. I had always
been taught, that virtue was of it&s;elf &s;ufficient
to happine&s;s; and that tho&s;e things which are
generally e&s;teemed evils, could have no power
to di&s;turb the felicity of a mind governed by
the eternal rule of right, and truly enamour|ed
of the charms of moral beauty, I re&s;olved,
therefore, to run all ri&s;ques, rather than depart
from this glorious principle. I felt my&s;elf
rai&s;ed by the trial, and exulted in the oppor|tunity
of &s;hewing my contempt of the &s;miles
or frowns of fortune, and of proving the
power of virtue to &s;u&s;tain the &s;oul under all
accidental circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I communicated my re&s;olution to my uncle,
a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time of my everla&s;t|ing
gratitude and re&s;pect, and that nothing
&s;hould have induced me to offend or di&s;obey
him, but his requiring me to do what my rea&s;on
<PB N="140" REF="140">
and con&s;cience di&s;approved; that &s;uppo&s;ing
the advantages of riches to be really as great as
he believed, yet &s;till tho&s;e of virtue were great|er,
and I could not re&s;love to purcha&s;e the one
by a violation of the other; that a fal&s;e vow was
certainly criminal; and that it would be doing
an act of the highe&s;t inju&s;tice, to enter into &s;o
&s;olemn an engagement without the power of
fulfilling it; that my affections did not de|pend
on my own will; and that no man &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s my per&s;on, who could not obtain the
fir&s;t place in my heart.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed that my uncle's impatience
had permitted me to go on thus far; but look|ing
in his face, I perceived that pa&s;&s;ion had kept
him &s;ilent. At length the gathering &s;torm
bur&s;t over my head in a torrent of reproaches;
my rea&s;ons were condemned as romantic ab|&s;urdities,
which I could not my&s;elf believe.
I was accu&s;ed of de&s;igning to deceive, and to
throw my&s;elf away on &s;ome worthle&s;s fellow,
who&s;e principles were as bad as my own. It
was in vain for me to a&s;&s;ert, that I had no &s;uch
de&s;ign, nor any inclination to marry at all. My
uncle could &s;ooner have believed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
<PB N="141" REF="141">
contradiction, than that a young woman could
&s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly refu&s;e one man, without being
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of another. As I
thought my&s;elf injured by his accu&s;ations and
tyranny, I gave over the attempt to mitigate
his anger. He appealed to Heaven for the
ju&s;tice of his re&s;entment, and again&s;t my in|gratitude
and rebellion; and then giving me
a note of fifty pounds, which he &s;aid would
keep me from immediate indigence, he bade
me leave his hou&s;e, and &s;ee his face no more.
I bowed in &s;ign of obedience, and collecting
all my dignity and re&s;olution, I aro&s;e, thanked
him for his pa&s;t benefits, and, with a low
curt&s;ey, left the room.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an hour, I departed, with my
little wardrobe, to the hou&s;e of a per&s;on who
had formerly been my father's &s;ervant, and
who now kept a &s;hop and let lodgings. From
thence I went the next day to vi&s;it my father's
nephew, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family
e&s;tate, and had lately married a lady of great
fortune. He was a young gentleman of good
parts, his principles the &s;ame as my father's,
though his practice had not been quite
<PB N="142" REF="142">
agreeable to the &s;trict rules of morality. How|ever,
&s;etting a&s;ide a few of tho&s;e vices which
are looked upon as genteel accompli&s;hments
in young fellows of fortune, I thought him a
good &s;ort of man; and, as we had always liv|ed
in great kindne&s;s, I doubted not that I
&s;hould find him my friend, and meet with ap|probation
and encouragement, at lea&s;t, if not
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from him. I told him my &s;tory,
and the rea&s;ons that had determined me to the
refu&s;al that had incurred my uncle's di&s;plea|&s;ure;
but how was I di&s;appointed, when, in|&s;tead
of the applau&s;e I expected for my heroic
virtue and unmerited per&s;ecutions, I perceiv|ed
a &s;mile of contempt on his face, when he
interrupted me in the following manner:</P>
<P>"And what in the devil's name, my dear
cou&s;in, could make a woman of your &s;en&s;e
behave &s;o like an ideot? What! forfeit all
your hopes from your uncle, refu&s;e an excel|lent
match, and reduce your&s;elf to beggary
becau&s;e, truly, you were not in love? Surely
one might have expected better from you even
at fifteen. Who is it, pray, that marries the
per&s;on of their choice? For my own part, who
<PB N="143" REF="143">
have rather a better title to plea&s;e my&s;elf,
with a good fifteen hundred a year, than you
who have not a &s;hilling, I found it would not
do; and that there was &s;omething more to be
&s;ought after in a wife, than a pretty face or a
genius. Do you think I cared three farthings
for the woman I married?&mdash;No, faith; but
her thirty thou&s;and pounds were worth hav|ing;
with that I can purcha&s;e a &s;eraglio of
beauties, and indulge my ta&s;te in every kind
of plea&s;ure. And, pray, what is it to me,
whether my wife has beauty, or wit, or ele|gance,
when her money will &s;upply me with
all that in others? You, cou&s;in, had an op|portunity
of being as happy as I am. The
men, believe me, would not like you a bit
the wor&s;e for being married; on the contrary,
you would find, that for one who took notice
of you as a &s;ingle woman, twenty would be
your admirers and humble &s;ervants, when
there was no danger of being taken in: thus
you might have gratified all your pa&s;&s;ions,
made an elegant figure in life, and have cho|&s;en
out &s;ome gentle &s;wain, as romantic and
poetical as you plea&s;ed, for your ceci&s;beo.
<PB N="144" REF="144">
The good John Trot hu&s;band would have
been ea&s;ily managed."</P>
<P>My indignation could be contained no lon|ger,
and I was leaving the room in di&s;dain,
when he caught me by the hand. "Nay,
prithee, my dear cou&s;in, none of the&s;e violent
airs: I thought you and I had known one ano|ther
better. Let the poor &s;ouls who are taught
by the prie&s;ts and their nur&s;es to be afraid of
hell-fire, and to think they &s;hall go to the de|vil
for following nature, and making life agree|able,
be as outrageou&s;ly virtuous as they
plea&s;e, you have too much &s;en&s;e to be fright|ened
at bugbears. You know that the term
of our exi&s;tence is but &s;hort, and it is highly
rea&s;onable to make it as plea&s;ant as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>I was too angry to attempt confu&s;ing his ar|guments;
but, bur&s;ting from his hold, told
him, I would take care not to give him a &s;e|cond
opportunity of in&s;ulting my di&s;tre&s;s, and
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ronting my under&s;tanding; and &s;o left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
hou&s;e with a re&s;olution never to enter it again.</P>
<P>I went home mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ified and di&s;ippointed;
my &s;pirits &s;unk into a dejection which took
from me, for many days, all inclination to
<PB N="145" REF="145">
&s;tir out of my lodging, or to &s;ee a human
face. At length I re&s;olved to try whether in|digence
and friend&s;hip were really incompati|ble,
and whether I &s;hould meet with the &s;ame
treatment from a female friend, who&s;e affec|tion
had been the principal plea&s;ure of my
youth. Surely, thought I, the gentle Aman|da,
who&s;e heart &s;eems capable of every tender
and generous &s;entiment, will do ju&s;tice to the
innocence and integrity of her unfortunate
friend; her tenderne&s;s will encourage my vir|tue,
and animate my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> her prai&s;es
and endearments will compen&s;ate all my hard|&s;hips.
Amanda was a &s;ingle woman, of a
moderate independent fortune, which I heard
&s;he was going to be&s;tow on a young officer,
who had little or nothing be&s;ides his commi&s;|&s;ion.
I had no doubt of her approbation of
my refu&s;ing a mercenary match, &s;ince &s;he her|&s;elf
had cho&s;en from motives &s;o oppo&s;ite to
tho&s;e which are called prudent. She had been
in the country &s;ome months, &s;o that my mi&s;|fortunes
had not reached her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, till I my&s;elf
related them to her.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="146">
She heard me with great attention, and an|&s;wered
with politene&s;s enough, but with a
coldne&s;s that chilled my very heart.</P>
<P>"You are &s;en&s;ible, my dear Fidelia," &s;aid
&s;he, "that I never pretended to &s;et my under|&s;tanding
in competition with yours. I know
my own inferiority, and though many of your
notions and opinions appeared to me very
&s;trange and particular, I never attempted to
di&s;pute them with you. To be &s;ure, you
know be&s;t: but it &s;eems to me a very odd con|duct,
for one in your &s;ituation to give offence
to &s;o good an uncle; fir&s;t, by maintaining
doctrines which may be very true for ought I
know, but which are very contrary to the re|ceived
opinions we are brought up in, and
therefore are apt to &s;hock a common under|&s;tanding;
and &s;econdly, to renounce his pro|tection,
and throw your&s;elf into the wide
world, rather than marry the man he cho&s;e
for you; to whom, after all, I do not find you
had any real objection, nor any antipathy for
his per&s;on."</P>
<P>"Antipathy, my dear," &s;aid I, "are there
not many degrees between loving and honour|ing
<PB N="147" REF="147">
a man preferably to all others, and behold|ing
him with abhorrence and aver&s;ion. The
fir&s;t is, in my opinion, the duty of a wife, a
duty voluntarily taken upon her&s;elf, and en|gaged
in under the mo&s;t &s;olemn contract. As
to the difficulties that may attend my friend|le&s;s,
unprovided &s;tate, &s;ince they are the con&s;e|quences
of a virtuous action, they cannot real|ly
be evils, nor can they di&s;turb that happine&s;s
which is the gift of virtue."&mdash;"I am heartily
glad," an&s;wered &s;he, "that you have found out
the art of making your&s;elf happy by the force
of imagination. I wi&s;h your enthu&s;ia&s;m may
continue, and that you may &s;till be farther
convinced, by your own experience, of the
folly of mankind, in &s;uppo&s;ing poverty and
di&s;grace to be evils."</P>
<P>I was cut to the &s;oul by the unkind manner
which accompanied this &s;arca&s;m, and was go|ing
to remon&s;trate again&s;t her unfriendly treat|ment,
when her lover came in, with another
gentleman, who, in &s;pite of my full heart,
engaged my attention, and, for a while, made
me forget the &s;tings of unkindne&s;s. The
beauty and gracefulne&s;s of his per&s;on caught
<PB N="148" REF="148">
my eye, and the politene&s;s of his addre&s;s, and
the elegance of his compliments, &s;oon preju|diced
me in favour of his under&s;tanding. He
was introduced by the captain to Amanda as his
mo&s;t intimate friend, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to
give credit to his friend's judgment, by making
him&s;elf as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. He &s;ucceed|ed
&s;o well, that Amanda was wholly engro&s;&s;ed
by the plea&s;ure of his conver&s;ation, and the
care of entertaining her lover and her new
gue&s;t. Her face brightened and her good hu|mour
returned. When I aro&s;e to leave her,
&s;he pre&s;&s;ed me &s;o earne&s;tly to &s;tay dinner, that
I could not, without di&s;covering how much I
re&s;ented her behaviour, refu&s;e. This, how|ever,
I &s;hould probably have done, as I was
naturally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew every &s;entiment of
my heart, had not a &s;ecret wi&s;h ari&s;en there to
know a little more of this agreeable &s;tranger.
This inclined me to think it prudent to con|ceal
my re&s;entment, and to accept the civili|ties
of Amanda. The conver&s;ation grew more
and more plea&s;ing; I took my &s;hare in it; and
had more than my &s;hare of the charming
&s;tranger's notice and attention. As we all grew
<PB N="149" REF="149">
more and more unre&s;erved, Amanda dropped
hints in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation relating
to my &s;tory, my &s;entiments, and unhappy &s;itu|ation.
Sir George Freelove, for that was the
young gentleman's name, li&s;tened greedily to
all that was &s;aid of me, and &s;eemed to eye me
with an earne&s;t curio&s;ity, as well as admiration.
We did not part till it was late; and Sir
George in&s;i&s;ted on attending me to my lodg|ings.
I &s;trongly refu&s;ed it, not without a &s;en|&s;ation,
which more properly belonged to the
female than the philo&s;opher, and which I con|demned
in my&s;elf, as ari&s;ing from di&s;hone&s;t
pride.</P>
<P>I could not, without pain, &s;uffer the polite
Sir George, upon &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance,
to di&s;cover the meanne&s;s of my abode. To
avoid this, I &s;ent for a chair, but was confu&s;|ed
to find that Sir George and his &s;ervants
prepared to attend it on foot, by way of guard.
It was in vain to di&s;pute: he him&s;elf walked
before, and his &s;ervants followed it. I was
covered with blu&s;hes, when, after all this pa|rade,
he handed me in at the little &s;hop door,
and took leave with as profound re&s;pect, as if
<PB N="150" REF="150">
he had guarded me into a palace. A thou&s;and
different thoughts kept me from clo&s;ing my
eyes that night. The behaviour of Amanda
wounded me to the &s;oul: I found that I mu&s;t
look on her as no more than a common ac|quaintance,
and that the world did not con|tain
one per&s;on whom I could call my friend.
My heart felt de&s;olate and forlorn. I knew
not what cour&s;e to take for my future &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence.
The pain which my pride had ju&s;t
given me, convinced me that I was far from
having conquered the pa&s;&s;ions of humanity,
and that I &s;hould feel too &s;en&s;ibly all the mor|tifications
which attend on poverty. I deter|mined,
however, to &s;ubdue this pride, and call
to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance the example of ancient &s;ages
and philo&s;ophers, who de&s;pi&s;ed riches and ho|nours,
and felt no inconveniencies from the
malice of fortune. I had almo&s;t rea&s;oned my|&s;elf
into a contempt for the world, and fan|cied
my&s;elf &s;uperior to its &s;miles or frowns,
when the idea of Sir George Freelove ru&s;hed
upon my mind, and de&s;troyed, at once, the
whole force of my rea&s;oning. I found that,
however I might di&s;regard the re&s;t of the
<PB N="151" REF="151">
world, I could not be indiffernt to his opi|nion;
and the thought of being de&s;pi&s;ed by
him was in&s;upportable. I recollected that my
condition was extremely different from that of
an old philo&s;opher, who&s;e rags, perhaps, were
the means of gratifying his pride, by attracting
the notice and re&s;pect of mankind: at lea&s;t,
the philo&s;opher's &s;chemes and wi&s;hes were ve|ry
different from tho&s;e which, at that time,
were taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart. The
looks and behaviour of Sir George, left me
no doubt, that I had made as deep an impre&s;|&s;ion
in his favour as he had done in mine. I
could not bear to lo&s;e the ground I had gained,
and to throw my&s;elf into a &s;tate below his no|tice.
I &s;corned the thought of impo&s;ing on
him with regard to my circum&s;tances, in ca&s;e
he &s;hould really have had favourable intentions
for me; yet to di&s;grace my&s;elf for ever in his
eye, by &s;ubmitting to &s;ervitude, or any low
way of &s;upporting my&s;elf, was what I could
not bring my&s;elf to re&s;olve on.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections. I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
the next morning, by a vi&s;it from Sir
George. He made re&s;pectful apologies for
<PB N="152" REF="152">
the liberty he took; told me he had learned
from my friend, that the unkindne&s;s and ty|ranny
of an uncle had ca&s;t me into unea&s;y cir|cum&s;tances;
and that he could not know that
&s;o much beauty and merit were &s;o unworthily
treated by fortune, without earne&s;tly wi&s;hing
to be the in&s;trument of doing me more ju&s;tice.
He entreated me to add dignity and value to
his life, by making it conducive to the happi|ne&s;s
of mine; and was going on with the mo&s;t
fervent offers of &s;ervice, when I interrupted
him, by &s;aying that there was nothing in his
power that I could with honour accept, by
which my life could be made happier, but that
re&s;pect which was due to me as a woman and
a gentlewoman, and which ought to have pre|vented
&s;uch offers of &s;ervice from a &s;tranger,
as could only be ju&s;tified by a long-experi|enced
friend&s;hip; that I was not in a &s;ituation
to receive vi&s;its, and mu&s;t decline his ac|quaintance,
which, neverthele&s;s, in a happier
part of my life would have given me plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He now had recour&s;e to all the arts of his
&s;ex, imputing his too great freedom to the force
of his pa&s;&s;ion, prote&s;ting the mo&s;t inviolable
<PB N="153" REF="153">
re&s;pect, and imploring on his knees, and even
with tears, that I would not puni&s;h him &s;o &s;e|verely,
as to deny him the liberty of &s;eeing
me, and making him&s;elf more and more wor|thy
of my e&s;teem. My weak heart was but
too much touched by his artifices, and I had
only ju&s;t fortitude enough to per&s;evere in re|fu&s;ing
his vi&s;its, and to in&s;i&s;t on his leaving
me, which at la&s;t he did; but with &s;uch a
profu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, prayers, and prote&s;ta|tions,
that it was &s;ome time before I could
recal my rea&s;on enough to reflect on the
whole of his behaviour, and on my own &s;itu|ation,
which compared, left me but little doubt
of his di&s;honourable views.</P>
<P>I determined never more to admit him to
my pre&s;ence, and accordingly gave orders to
be denied, if he came again. My rea&s;on ap|plauded,
but my heart reproached me, and
heavily repined at the rigid determination of
prudence. I knew that I acted rightly, and I
expected that that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s would make
me happy; but I found it otherwi&s;e, I was
wretched beyond what I had ever felt, or
formed any idea of. I di&s;covered that my
<PB N="154" REF="154">
heart was entangled in a pa&s;&s;ion which mu&s;t
for ever be combated, or indulged at the ex|pence
of virtue. I now con&s;idered riches as
truly de&s;irable, &s;ince they would have placed
me above di&s;graceful attempts, and given me
rea&s;onable hopes of becoming the wife of Sir
George Freelove. I was di&s;contented and un|happy,
but &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;appointed to find
my&s;elf &s;o, &s;ince hitherto I had no one crimi|nal
action to reproach my&s;elf with; on the
contrary, my difficulties were all owing to my
regard for virtue.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved, however, to try &s;till farther the
power of virtue to confer happine&s;s, to go on
in my obedience to her laws, and patient|ly
wait the good effects of it. But I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
&s;tronger difficulties to go through than any I
had yet experienced: Sir George was too
much practi&s;ed in the arts of &s;eduction to be
di&s;couraged by a fir&s;t repul&s;e, every day pro|duced
either &s;ome new attempt to &s;ee me, or
a letter full of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate prote&s;ta|tions
and entreaties for pardon and favour: it
was in vain I gave orders that no more letters
&s;hould be taken in from him: he had &s;o many
<PB N="155" REF="155">
different contrivances to convey them, and
directed them in hands &s;o unlike, that I was
&s;urpri&s;ed into reading them, contrary to my
intentions. Every time I &s;tirred out, he was
&s;ure to be in my way, and to employ the mo&s;t
artful tongue that ever en&s;nared the heart of
woman, in blinding my rea&s;on and awakening
my pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>My virtue, however, did not yet give way,
but my peace of mind was utterly de&s;troyed.
Whenever I was with him, I &s;ummoned all
my fortitude, and con&s;tantly repeated my
commands, that he &s;hould avoid me: his di&s;|obedience
called for my re&s;entment, and, in
&s;pite of my melting heart, I armed my eyes
with anger, and treated him with as much
di&s;dain as I thought his unworthy de&s;igns
de&s;erved. But the moment he left me, all
my re&s;olution for&s;ook me, I repined at my
fate, I even murmured again&s;t the Sove|reign
Ruler of all things, for making me
&s;ubject to pa&s;&s;ions I could not &s;ubdue, yet
mu&s;t not indulge. I compared my own &s;itu|ation
with that of my libertine cou&s;in, who&s;e
pernicious arguments I had heard with horror
<PB N="156" REF="156">
and dete&s;tation; who gave the reins to every
de&s;ire; who&s;e hou&s;e was the &s;eat of plenty,
mirth, and delight; who&s;e face was ever cover|ed
with &s;miles; and who&s;e heart &s;eemed free
from &s;orrow and care. Is not this man, &s;aid I,
happier than I am? and if &s;o, where is the
worth of virtue? Have I not &s;acrificed to her
my fortune and my friends? Do I not daily
&s;acrifice to her my darling inclination; yet,
what is the compen&s;ation &s;he offers me?
What are my pro&s;pects in this world but
poverty, mortification, di&s;appointment, and
grief? Every wi&s;h of my heart denied, every
pa&s;&s;ion of humanity combated and hurt, though
never conquered! Are the&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings
with which Heaven di&s;tingui&s;hes it favourites?
Can the King of Heaven want power or
will to di&s;tingui&s;h them? or does he leave
his wretched creatures the &s;port of chance,
the prey of wickedne&s;s and malice? Surely
no. Yet is not the condition of the virtuous
often more mi&s;erable than that of the vicious?
I my&s;elf have experienced that it is. I am
very unhappy, and &s;ee no likelihood of my
being otherwi&s;e in this world&mdash;and all beyond
<PB N="157" REF="157">
the grave is eternal darkne&s;s. Yet why do I
&s;ay that I have no pro&s;pect of happine&s;s? does
not the mo&s;t engaging of men offer me all the
joys that love and fortune can be&s;tow? Will
not he protect me from every in&s;ult of the
proud world that &s;coffs at indigence? Will
not his liberal hand pour forth the means of
every plea&s;ure, even of that highe&s;t and true&s;t
of all plea&s;ure, the power of relieving the
&s;ufferings of my fellow-creatures, of changing
the tears of di&s;tre&s;s into tears of joy and grati|tude,
of communicating my own happine&s;s to
all around me? Is not this a &s;tate far prefer|able
to that in which virtue has placed me?
But what is virtue? Is not happine&s;s the laud|able
pur&s;uit of rea&s;on? Is it not then laudable
to pur&s;ue it by the mo&s;t probable means?
Have I not been accu&s;ing Providence of un|kindne&s;s,
whil&s;t I my&s;elf only am in fault for
rejecting its offered favours? Surely, I have
mi&s;taken the path of virtue: it mu&s;t be that
which leads to happine&s;s. The path which I
am in is full of thorns and briars, and termi|nates
in impenetrable darkne&s;s; but I &s;ee an|other
that is &s;trewed with flowers, and bright
<PB N="158" REF="158">
with the &s;un &s;hine of pro&s;perity: this, &s;urely,
is the path of virtue and the road to happine&s;s.
Hither then let me turn my weary &s;teps, nor
let vain and idle prejudices fright me from fe|licity.
It is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould
offend God, by yielding to a temptation which
he has given me no motive to re&s;i&s;t. He has
allotted me a &s;hort and precarious exi&s;tence,
and has placed before me good and evil. What
is good but plea&s;ure? What is evil but pain?
Rea&s;on and nature direct me to chu&s;e the fir&s;t,
and avoid the la&s;t. I &s;ought for happine&s;s in
what is called virtue, but I found it not: &s;hall
I not try the other experiment, &s;ince I think
I can hardly be more unhappy by following
inclination, than I am by denying it?</P>
<P>Thus had my frail thoughts wandered into
a wilderne&s;s of error, and thus had I almo&s;t
rea&s;oned my&s;elf out of every principle of mo|rality,
by pur&s;uing, through all their con&s;e|quences,
the doctrines which had been taught
me as rules of life and pre&s;criptions for felici|ty,
the tali&s;inans of truth, by which I &s;hould be
&s;ecured in the &s;torms of adver&s;ity, and li&s;ten
without danger to the &s;yrens of temptation;
<PB N="159" REF="159">
when, in the fatal hour of my pre&s;umption,
&s;itting alone in my chamber, collecting argu|ments
on the &s;ide of pa&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t di&s;tracted
with doubts, and plunging deeper and deeper
into fal&s;ehood, I &s;aw Sir George Freelove at
my feet, who had gained admittance, contrary
to my orders, by corrupting my landlady. It
is not nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe to you his arts, or
the weak effects of that virtue which had been
graciou&s;ly implanted in my heart, but which I
had taken impious means to undermine by fal&s;e
rea&s;oning, and which now tottered from the
foundation: &s;u&s;&s;ice it that I &s;ubmitted to the hu|miliation
I have &s;o well de&s;erved, and tell you,
that, in the pride of human rea&s;on I dared to
condemn, as the effect of weakne&s;s and pre|judice,
the &s;till voice of con&s;cience, which
would yet have warned me from ruin; that my
innocence, my honour was the &s;acrifice to
pa&s;&s;ion and &s;ophi&s;try; that my boa&s;ted philo|&s;ophy,
and too much &s;lattered under&s;tanding,
pre&s;erved me not from the lowe&s;t depth of in|&s;amy,
which the weake&s;t of my &s;ex with hu|mility
and religion would have avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">
I now experienced a new kind of wretch|edne&s;s:
my vile &s;educer tried in vain to re|concile
me to the &s;hameful life to which he
had reduced me, by loading me with finery,
and lavi&s;hing his fortune in procuring me plea|&s;ures
which I could not ta&s;te, and pomp which
&s;eemed an in&s;ult on my di&s;grace. In vain did
I recollect the arguments which had convinc|ed
me of the lawfulne&s;s of accepting offered
plea&s;ures, and following the dictates of incli|nation.
The light of my under&s;tanding was
darkened, but the &s;en&s;e of guilt was not lo&s;t:
my pride and my delicacy, if, criminal as I
was, I may dare to call it &s;o, &s;uffered the mo&s;t
intolerable mortification and di&s;gu&s;t every time
I reflected on my infamous &s;ituation. Every
eye &s;eemed to upbraid me, even that of my
triumphant &s;educer. O depth of mi&s;ery! to
be con&s;cious of de&s;erving the contempt of him
I loved, and for who&s;e &s;ake I was become
contemptible to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of my mind during a
year which I pa&s;&s;ed in Sir George's hou&s;e:
his fondne&s;s was unabated for eight months of
the time; and as I had no other object to
<PB N="161" REF="161">
&s;hare my attention, neither friend nor relation
to call off any part of my tenderne&s;s, all the
love of a heart naturally affectionate centered
in him. The fir&s;t dawnings of unkindne&s;s were
but too vi&s;ible to my watchful eyes. I had
now all the torments of jealou&s;y to endure,
till a cruel certainty put an end to them; I
learnt, at length, that my fal&s;e lover was on
the brink of marriage with a lady of great for|tune.
I immediately re&s;olved to leave him,
but could not do it without fir&s;t venting my
full heart in complaints and reproaches. This
provoked his rage, and drew on me in&s;olence,
which, though I had de&s;erved, I had not
learnt to bear. I returned with &s;corn, which
no longer became me, all the wages of my &s;in,
and the trappings of my &s;hame, and left his
hou&s;e in the bittere&s;t angui&s;h of re&s;entment
and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>I returned to my old lodgings; but unable to
bear a &s;cene which recalled every circum&s;tance
of my undoing, a&s;hamed to look in the fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
of any creature who had &s;een me innocent,
wretched in my&s;elf, and hoping from change
of place &s;ome abatement of my mi&s;ery, I p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
<PB N="162" REF="162">
my&s;elf into a po&s;t-chai&s;e at two in the morn|ing,
with orders to the driver to carry me as
far from town as he could before the return of
night, leaving it to him to chu&s;e the road.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on and my &s;en&s;es &s;eemed benumbed
and &s;tupified during my journey. I made no
reflections on what I was about, nor formed
any de&s;ign for my future life. When night
came, my conductor would have &s;topped at a
large town, but I bid him go on to the next
village: there I alighted at a paltry inn, and
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my vehicle, without once con&s;ider|ing
what I was to do with my&s;elf, or why I
cho&s;e that place for my abode. To &s;ay truth,
I can give no account of my thoughts at this
period of time: they were all confu&s;ed and
di&s;tracted. A &s;hort frenzy mu&s;t have filled up
tho&s;e hours, of which my memory retains &s;uch
imperfect traces. I remember only, that with|out
having pulled off my clothes, I left the
inn as &s;oon as I &s;aw the day, and wandered
out of the village.</P>
<P>My unguided feet carried me to a range of
willows by a river's &s;ide, where, after having
walked &s;ome time, the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air re|vived
<PB N="163" REF="163">
my &s;en&s;es, and awakened my rea&s;on.
My rea&s;on, my memory, my angui&s;h, and de|&s;pair
returned together. Every circum&s;tance
of my pa&s;t life was pre&s;ent to my mind; but
mo&s;t the idea of my faithle&s;s lover, and my
criminal love tortured my imagination and
rent my bleeding heart, which, in &s;pite of all its
guilt and all its wrongs, retained the tendere&s;t
and mo&s;t ardent affection for its undo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r. This
unguarded affection, which was the effect of a
gentle and kind nature, heightened the angui&s;h
of re&s;entment, and compleated my mi&s;ery.
In vain did I call off my thoughts from this
gloomy retro&s;pect, and hope to find a gleam of
comfort in my future pro&s;pects. They were
&s;till more dreadful: poverty, attended by in|famy,
and want groaning under the cruel hand
of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the taunts of in&s;olence were
before my eyes. I, who had once been the
darling and the pride of indulgent parents,
who had once been beloved, re&s;pected, and
admired, was now the outca&s;t of human na|ture;
de&s;pi&s;ed and avoided by all who had
ever loved me, by all whom I had mo&s;t loved!
<PB N="164" REF="164">
hateful to my&s;elf, belonging to no one, ex|po&s;ed
to wrongs and in&s;ults from all.</P>
<P>I tried to find out the cau&s;e of this di&s;mal
change, and how far I was my&s;elf the occa&s;ion
of it. My conduct, with regard to Sir George,
though I &s;pontaneou&s;ly condemned, yet, upon
recollection, I thought the arguments which
produced it would ju&s;tify. But as my prin|ciples
could not pre&s;erve me from vice, nei|ther
could they &s;u&s;tain me in adver&s;ity: con|&s;cience
was not to be perverted by the &s;ophi&s;|try
which had beclouded my rea&s;on. And if
any, by imputing my conduct to error, &s;hould
acquit me of guilt, let them remember, it is yet
true, that in this uttermo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, I was nei|ther
&s;u&s;tained by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inno|cence,
the exultation of virtue, nor the hope of
reward: whether I looked backward or for|ward,
all was confu&s;ion and angui&s;h, di&s;traction
and de&s;pair. I accu&s;ed the Supreme Being
of cruelty and inju&s;tice, who, though he gave
me not &s;ufficient encouragement to re&s;i&s;t de|&s;ire,
yet puni&s;hes me with the con&s;equences
of indulgence. If there is a God, cried I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="165" REF="165">
he mu&s;t be either tyrannical and cruel, or re|gardle&s;s
of her creatures. I will no longer
endure a being which is unde&s;ervedly mi&s;er|able,
either from chance or de&s;ign, but fly to
that annihilation in which all my pro&s;pects
terminate. Take back, &s;aid I, li&s;ting my eyes
to Heaven, the hateful gift of exi&s;tence, and
let my du&s;t no more be animated to &s;uffering,
and exalted to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I ran to the brink of the river,
and was going to plunge in, when the cry of
&s;ome per&s;on very near me made me turn my
eyes to &s;ee whence it came. I was ac|co&s;ted
by an elderly gentleman, who, with
looks of terror, pity, and benevolence, a&s;ked
what I was about to do? At fir&s;t I was &s;ullen,
and refu&s;ed to an&s;wer him: but by degrees the
compa&s;&s;ion he &s;hewed, and the tenderne&s;s
with which he treated me, &s;oftened my heart,
and gave vent to my tears.</P>
<P>"O, Madam!" &s;aid he, "the&s;e are gracious
&s;igns, and unlike tho&s;e which fir&s;t drew my
attention, and made me watch you unob&s;erv|ed,
fearing &s;ome fatal purpo&s;e in your mind.
What mu&s;t be the thoughts which could make
<PB N="166" REF="166">
a face like yours appear the picture of horror?
I was taking my morning walk, and have &s;een
you a con&s;iderable time: &s;ometimes &s;topping
and wringing your hands, &s;ometimes quicken|ing
your pace, and &s;ometimes walking &s;low,
with your eyes fixed on the ground, till you
rai&s;ed them to Heaven, with looks not of &s;up|plication
and piety, but rather of accu&s;ation
and defiance. For pity tell me, how it is that
you have quarrelled with your&s;elf, with life,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ay even with Heaven? Recal your rea&s;on
and your hope, and let this &s;ea&s;onable preven|tion
of your fatal purpo&s;e be an earne&s;t to you
of good things to come, of God's mercy not
yet alienated from you, and &s;tooping from his
throne to &s;ave your &s;oul from perdition?"</P>
<P>The tears which flowed in rivers from my
eyes while he talked, gave me &s;o much relief,
that I found my&s;elf able to &s;peak, and de&s;irous
to expre&s;s my gratitude for the good man's
concern for me. It was &s;o long &s;ince I had
known the joys of confidence, that I felt &s;ur|pri&s;ing
plea&s;ure and comfort from unbur|dening
my heart, and telling my kind deli|verer
every circum&s;tance of my &s;tory, and
<PB N="167" REF="167">
every thought of my di&s;tracted mind. He
&s;huddered to hear me upbraid the Divine Pro|vidence,
and &s;topping me &s;hort, told me he
would lead me to one who &s;hould preach pa|tience
to me whil&s;t &s;he gave me the example
of it.</P>
<P>As we talked he lead me to his own hou&s;e,
and there introduced me to his wife, a middle|aged
woman, pale and emaciated, but of a
cheerful placid countenance, who received
me with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s and humanity.
She &s;aw I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and her compa&s;&s;ion
was before hand with my complaints. Her
tears &s;tood ready to accompany mine; her
looks and her voice expre&s;&s;ed the kinde&s;t con|cern;
and her a&s;&s;iduous cares demon&s;trated that
true politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality, which is not
the effect of art but of inward benevolence.
While &s;he obliged me to take &s;ome refre&s;h|ment,
her hu&s;band gave her a &s;hort account of
my &s;tory, and of the &s;tate in which he found
me. "This poor lady," &s;aid he, "from the
fault of her education and principles, &s;ees
every thing through a gloomy medium. She
accu&s;es Providence, and hates her exi&s;tence

for tho&s;e evils which are the common lot of
mankind in this &s;hort &s;tate of trial. You, my

her faulty impatience, and to convince her, by
your own example, that this world is not the
place in which virtue is to find its reward.
She thinks no one &s;o unhappy as her&s;elf; but

&s;he would &s;urely be &s;en&s;ible, that if you are

<P>"Indeed, my dear madam!" &s;aid &s;he,
"that is the only advantage that I have over
you; but that indeed out weighs every thing
el&s;e. It is now but ten days &s;ince I followed
to the grave my only &s;on, the &s;urvivor of eight

and &s;aw him &s;uffer the mo&s;t amazing
pains. Nor was poverty, that dreaded evil, to
which you could not &s;ubmit, wanting to my
<PB N="169" REF="169">
trials: though my hu&s;band is, by his profe&s;|&s;ion,
a gentleman, his income is &s;o &s;mall, that
I and my children have often wanted nece&s;&s;a|ries:
and though I had always a weakly con|&s;titution,
I have helped to &s;upport my family
by the labour of my own hands At this time
I am con&s;uming, by daily tortures, with a can|cer,
which mu&s;t &s;hortly be my death. My
pains, perhaps, might be mitigated by proper
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though nothing could pre&s;erve my
life; but I have not the means to obtain that
a&s;&s;i&s;tance." O, hold! interrupted I, my &s;oul
is &s;hocked at the enumeration of &s;uch intoler|able
&s;ufferings: how is it that you &s;upport
them? Why do I not &s;ee you, in de&s;pair like
mine, renounce your exi&s;tence, and put your|&s;elf
out of the reach of torment? But, above
all, tell me how it is po&s;&s;ible for you to pre|&s;erve,
amid&s;t &s;uch complicated mi&s;ery, that
appearance of cheerfulne&s;s and &s;erene com|placency
which &s;hines &s;o remarkably in your
countenance, and animates every look and
motion.</P>
<P>"That cheerfulne&s;s and complacency," an|&s;wered
the good woman, "I feel in my heart.
<PB N="70" REF="170">
My mind is not only &s;erene, but often experi|ences
the highe&s;t emotions of joy and exulta|tion,
that the brighte&s;t hopes can give." And
whence, &s;aid I, do you derive this a&s;toni&s;hing
art of extracting joy from mi&s;ery, and of &s;mil|ing
amid&s;t all the terrors of pain, &s;orrow, po|verty,
and death? She was &s;ilent for a moment,
then &s;tepping to her clo&s;et, reached a Bible,
which &s;he put into my hands: "See there,"
&s;aid &s;he, "the volume in which I have learnt
this art. Here I am taught, that everla&s;ting
glory is in &s;tore for all who will accept it
upon the terms which Infinite Perfection has
pre&s;cribed; here I am promi&s;ed con&s;olation,
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;upport from the Lord of Life;
and here I am a&s;&s;ured, that my tran&s;ient af|flictions
are only meant to fit me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> eternal
and un&s;peakable happine&s;s. This happine&s;s is
at hand. The &s;hort remainder of my life
&s;eems but a point, beyond which opens the
glorious pro&s;pect of immortality: thus encou|raged,
how &s;hould I be dejected? Thus &s;up|ported,
how &s;hould I &s;ink? With &s;uch pro|&s;pects,
&s;uch a&s;&s;ured hopes, how can I be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ther|ways
than happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="171">
While &s;he &s;poke, her eyes &s;parkled, and her
whole face &s;eemed animated with joy. I was
&s;truck with her manner, as well as her words.
Every &s;yllable &s;he uttered &s;eemed to &s;ink into
my &s;oul, &s;o that I never can forget it. I
re&s;olved to examine a religion, which was
capable of producing &s;uch effects as I could
not attribute either to chance or error. The
good couple pre&s;&s;ed me, with &s;o much unaf|fected
kindne&s;s, to make their little par&s;onage
my a&s;ylum till I could better di&s;po&s;e of my|&s;elf,
that I accepted their offer. Here, with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the clergyman, who is a plain,
&s;en&s;ible, and truly pious man, I have &s;tudied
the Holy Scriptures, and the evidences of
their authority. But after reading them with
candour and attention, I found all the intrin|&s;ic
arguments of their truth &s;uperfluous: the
excellency of their precepts, the con&s;i&s;tency
of their doctrines, and the glorious motives
and encouragements to virtue which they pro|po&s;e;
together with the &s;triking example I
had before my eyes of their &s;alutary effects,
left me no doubt of their divine authority.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="172">
During the time of my abode here, I have
been witne&s;s to the more than heroic, the joy|ful,
the triumphant death of the dear good wo|man.
With as much &s;oftne&s;s and tenderne&s;s as
I ever &s;aw in a female character, &s;he &s;hewed
more dauntle&s;s intrepidity than the &s;terne&s;t
philo&s;opher, or the proude&s;t hero. No tor|ment
could &s;hake the con&s;tancy of her &s;oul,
or length of pain wear out the &s;trength of her
patience. Death was to her an object not of
horror but of hope. When I heard her pour
forth her la&s;t breath in thank&s;giving, and &s;aw
the &s;mile of exta&s;y remain on her pale face
when life was fled, I could not help crying
out in the beautiful language I had lately
learnt from the Sacred Writings, "O Death!
where is thy &s;ting? O Grave! where is thy
victory?"</P>
<P>I am now preparing to leave my excellent
benefactor, and get my bread in a &s;ervice, to
which he has recommended me in a neigh|bouring
family. A &s;tate of &s;ervitude, to
which once I could not re&s;olve to yield, ap|pears
no longer dreadful to me; that pride,
which would have made it galling, Chri&s;tianity
<PB N="173" REF="173">
has &s;ubdued, though philo&s;ophy attempted it in
vain. As a penitent, I &s;hould gratefully &s;ub|mit
to mortification; but as a Chri&s;tian, I find
my&s;elf &s;uperior to every mortification, except
the &s;en&s;e of guilt. This has humbled me to
the du&s;t: but the a&s;&s;urances that are given me
by the Saviour of the world of the divine
pardon and favour, upon &s;incere repentance,
have calmed my troubled &s;pirit, and filled
my mind with peace and joy, which the world
can neither give nor take away. Thus, with|out
any change for the better in my outward
circum&s;tances, I find my&s;elf changed from a
di&s;tracted, poor, de&s;pairing wretch, to a con|tented,
happy, grateful being; thankful for,
and plea&s;ed with my pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence;
yet exulting in the hope of quitting it for end|le&s;s
glory and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>O! Sir, tell the unthinking mortals, who
will not take the pains of enquiring into tho&s;e
truths which mo&s;t concern them, and who are
led by fa&s;hion, and the pride of human rea&s;on,
into a contempt for the &s;acred oracles of God,
tell them this truth, which experience hath
taught me, that though vice is con&s;tantly at|tended
<PB N="174" REF="174">
by mi&s;ery, virtue it&s;elf cannot confer
happine&s;s in this world, except it is animated
with the hopes of eternal bli&s;s in the world to
come.</P>
