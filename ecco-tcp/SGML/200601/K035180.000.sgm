<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ADDRESSED TO MAGISTRATES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Preten&s;ions and Di&s;cour&s;e of Men, throughout the&s;e Kingdoms, would, at fir&s;t View, lead one to think the Inhabitants were all Politici|ans; and yet, perhaps, poli|tical Wi&s;dom hath in no Age, or Country, been more talked of, and le&s;s under&s;tood.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Licence is taken for the End of Govern|ment, and popular Humour for its Origine. No Reverence for the Laws, no Attach|ment to the Con&s;titution, little Attention to Matters of Con&s;equence, and great Alterca|tion upon Trifles, &s;uch idle Projects about Religion and Government, as if the Public had both to chu&s;e, a general Contempt of all Authority, Divine and Humane, an In|difference about the prevailing Opinions, whether they tend to produce Order, or Di&s;order, to promote the Empire of God or the Devil: The&s;e are the Symptoms that &s;trongly mark the pre&s;ent Age; and this, could never have been the Ca&s;e, if a Ne|glect of Religion had not made Way for it.</P>
<P>WHEN the jews accu&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> upon reli|gious Matters, and Points of their Law, be|fore <HI>Gallio,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Magi&s;trate; it is &s;aid, that GALLIO <HI>cared for none of tho&s;e Things.</HI> And it is to be feared, there are not a few Magi&s;trates, in this Chri&s;tian Country, who think with the &s;ame Indiffe|rence on the Subject of Religion. Herein, neverthele&s;s, they judge ami&s;s, and are much wanting to their Duty. For, al|though it be admitted, that the Magi&s;trate's peculiar Object, is the temporal Welfare of the State; yet, this will by no Means ex|clude a proper Care about the prevailing Notions and Opinions of Religion, which
<PB N="5" REF="4">
influence the Lives and Actions of Men, and have therefore a mighty Effect on the Public. Men's Behaviour is the Con&s;e|quence of their Principles. Hence it fol|lows, that in order to make a State thrive and flouri&s;h, Care mu&s;t be taken, that good Principles be propagated in the Minds of tho&s;e who compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>IT would be vain, to depend on the out|ward Form, the Con&s;titution, and Structure of a State; while the Majority are ever governed by their inward Ways of think|ing, which at Times will break out and &s;hew them&s;elves paramount to all Laws and In&s;titutions what&s;oever. It mu&s;t be great Folly therefore, to overlook Notions, as Matters of &s;mall Moment to the State; while Experience &s;heweth there is nothing more important; and that a prevailing Di&s;order in the Principles and Opinions of its Members, is ever dangerous to Society, and capable of producing the greate&s;t Pub|lic Evils.</P>
<P>MAN is an Animal, formidable both from his Pa&s;&s;ions, and his Rea&s;on; his Pa&s;&s;ions often urging him to great Evils, and his Rea&s;on furni&s;hing Means to atchieve them. To tame this Animal, and make him a|menable to Order, to inure him with a Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tice and Virtue, to with-hold him from ill Cour&s;es by Fear, and encou|rage
<PB N="6" REF="5">
him in his Duty by Hopes; in &s;hort, to fa&s;hion and model him for Society, hath been the Aim of civil and religious In&s;titu|tions; and in all Times, the Endeavour of good and wi&s;e Men. The apte&s;t Method for attaining this End, hath been always judged a proper Education.</P>
<P>IF Men's Actions are an Effect of their Principles; that is, of their Notions, their Belief, their Per&s;ua&s;ions; it mu&s;t be admit|ted, that Principles early &s;own in the Mind, are the Seeds which produce Fruit and Har|ve&s;t in the ripe State of Manhood. How lightly &s;oever &s;ome Men may &s;peak of No|tions; yet, &s;o long as the Soul governs the Body, Mens Notions mu&s;t influence their Actions, more or le&s;s, as they are &s;tronger or weaker; and to good or evil, as they are better or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>OUR Notions and Opinions, are a con|&s;tant Check on our Appetites, and Balance to our Pa&s;&s;ions; and, although they may not in every In&s;tance controll and rule, yet they will never fail, &s;trongly to affect both the one, and the other. What is it that bridles the impetuous De&s;ires of Men? That re&s;trains them when they are driven by the mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ions? In a Word, what is it that renders this World habitable, but the prevailing Notions of Order, Virtue, and Duty? Some, perhaps, may imagine, that
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the Eye of the Magi&s;trate alone, is &s;uffici|ent to keep Mankind in Awe. But, if every Man's Heart was &s;et to do all the Mi&s;chief his Appetite &s;hould prompt him to, as oft as Opportunity and Secrecy pre&s;ented them|&s;elves, there could be no Living in the World.</P>
<P>AND although too many of tho&s;e intru&s;t|ed with Civil Power, in the&s;e our Days, may be &s;aid with GALLIO, to <HI>Care for none of tho&s;e Things</HI>; and many more who would pa&s;s for Men of Judgment and Knowledge, may look on Notions early imbibed, before their Grounds and Rea&s;ons are apprehended or under&s;tood, to be but mere Prejudices; yet this will detract nothing from their Truth and U&s;efulne&s;s. To place this Mat|ter in a due Light, I propo&s;e to &s;hew, that a Sy&s;tem of Salutary Notions, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of every Civil Con|&s;titution. I &s;hall enforce this Point, by the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e who are e&s;teemed the wi&s;e&s;t Men; and, I &s;hall make &s;ome Re|marks on the modern prevailing Spirit, and the Tendency of the Maxims of our Times.</P>
<P>ORDER is nece&s;&s;ary, not only to the Well-Being, but to the very Being of a State. Now, Order and Regularity in the Actions of Men, is not an Effect of Appe|tite or Pa&s;&s;ion, but of Judgment: And the Judgment is governed by Notions or Opini|ons.
<PB N="8" REF="7">
There mu&s;t therefore, of Nece&s;&s;ity, in a well-ordered State, be a certain Sy&s;tem of Salutary Notions, a prevailing Set of O|pinions, acquired either by private Rea|&s;on and Reflection, or taught and in&s;tilled by the general Rea&s;on of the Public; that is, by the Law of the Land. True it is, that where Men either cannot, or will not, u&s;e their own Rea&s;on, think and examine for them&s;elves; in &s;uch Ca&s;e, the Notions taught or in&s;tilled into their Minds, are em|braced rather by the Memory, than the Judgment. Nor will it be any Objection to &s;ay, that the&s;e are Prejudices; ina&s;much, as they are therefore, neither the le&s;s u&s;e|ful, nor the le&s;s true, although their Proofs may not be under&s;tood by all Men.</P>
<P>PREJUDICES are Notions, or Opinions, which the Mind entertains without knowing the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of them, and which are a&s;&s;ented to without Examination. The fir&s;t Notions which take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Minds of Men, with regard to Duties &s;ocial, moral, and civil, may therefore be ju&s;tly &s;tyled Prejudices. The Mind of a young Creature cannot remain empty. If you do not put into it that which is good, it will be &s;ure to receive that which is bad.</P>
<P>DO what you can, there will &s;till be a Bias from Education; and if &s;o, is it not better this Bias &s;hould lie towards Things
<PB N="9" REF="8">
laudable and u&s;eful to Society? This Bias &s;till operates, although it may not always prevail. The Notions fir&s;t in&s;tilled, have the earlie&s;t Influence, take the deepe&s;t Root, and generally are found to give a Colour and Complexion to the &s;ub&s;equent Lives of Men, ina&s;much as they are in Truth the great Source of humane Actions. It is not Gold, or Honour, or Power, that move Men to act, but the Opinions they entertain of tho&s;e Things. Hence it follows, that if a Magi&s;trate &s;hould &s;ay, or think, no Mat|ter what Notions Men embrace, I will take Heed to their Actions; therein he &s;heweth his Weakne&s;s, for &s;uch as are Men's No|tions, &s;uch will be their Deeds.</P>
<P>FOR a Man to do, as he would be done by; to love his Neighbour as him&s;elf; to honour his Superiors; to believe that God &s;cans all his Actions, and will reward or puni&s;h them; and to think, that he who is guilty of Fal&s;hood, or Inju&s;tice, hurts him&s;elf more than any one el&s;e: Are not the&s;e &s;uch Notions, and Principles, as every wi&s;e Go|vernor, or Legi&s;lator, would covet above all Things to have firmly rooted in the Mind of every Individual under his Care. This is allowed, even by the Enemies of Religion, who would fain have it thought the Off-&s;pring of State Policy, honouring its U&s;efulne&s;s at the &s;ame Time that they di&s;parage its Truth. What therefore can|not
<PB N="10" REF="9">
be acquired by every Man's Rea&s;oning, mu&s;t be introduced by Precept, and riveted by Cu&s;tom; that is to &s;ay, the Bulk of Mankind mu&s;t in all civilized Societies, have their Minds by timely In&s;truction well &s;ea&s;oned and furni&s;hed with proper Notions, which, although the Grounds or Proofs thereof be unknown to them, will neverthe|le&s;s influence their Conduct, and &s;o far ren|der them u&s;eful Members of the State. But if you &s;trip Men of the&s;e their Notions, or if you will Prejudices, with Regard to Mo|de&s;ty, Decency, Ju&s;tice, Charity, and the like; you will &s;oon find them &s;o many Mon&s;ters, utterly unfit for humane Society.</P>
<P>I DESIRE it may be con&s;idered, that mo&s;t Men want Lei&s;ure, Opportunity, or Facul|ties, to derive Conclu&s;ions from their Prin|ciples, and e&s;tabli&s;h Morality on a Founda|tion of humane Science. True it is, (as St. <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves) that <HI>The invi&s;ible Things of God from the Creation of the World, are clearly &s;een.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ROM. Ch. i. Ver. 20.</BIBL></NOTE> And from thence the Duties of natural Religion may be di&s;covered. But the&s;e Things are &s;een and di&s;covered by tho&s;e alone who open their Eyes, and look narrowly for them. Now, if you look throughout the World, you &s;hall find but few of the&s;e narrow In&s;pectors and Inquirers, very few who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to ana|ly&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Opinions, and pur&s;ue them to their ra|tional Source, to examine whence Truths &s;pring, and how they are inferred. In &s;hort, you &s;hall find all Men full of Opini|ons, but Knowledge only in a few.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature and Cir|cum&s;tances of humane Kind, that the Mul|titude &s;hould be Philo&s;ophers, or that they &s;hould know Things in their Cau&s;es. We &s;ee every Day, that the Rules, or Conclu|&s;ions alone, are &s;ufficient for the Shop-keeper to &s;tate his Account, the Sailor to navigate his Ship, or the Carpenter to mea&s;ure his Timber; none of which under&s;tand the Theory; that is to &s;ay, the Grounds and Rea&s;ons either of Arithmetic or Geometry. Even &s;o in moral, political, and religious Matters, it is manife&s;t that the Rules and Opinions early imbibed at the fir&s;t Dawn of Under&s;tanding, and without the lea&s;t Glimp&s;e of Science, may yet produce ex|cellent Effects, and be very u&s;eful to the World: And that in Fact they are &s;o, will be very vi&s;ible to every one who &s;hall ob|&s;erve what pa&s;&s;eth round about him. It may not be ami&s;s to inculcate, that the Dif|ference between Prejudices and other Opi|nions doth not con&s;i&s;t in this; that the for|mer are fal&s;e, and the latter true; but in this, that the former are taken upon Tru&s;t, and the latter acquired by Rea&s;oning. He who hath been taught to believe the Im|mortality
<PB N="12" REF="11">
of the Soul, may be as right in his Notion, as he who hath rea&s;oned him|&s;elf into that Opinion. It will then by no Means follow, that becau&s;e this or that No|tion is a Prejudice, it mu&s;t be therefore fal&s;e. The not di&s;tingui&s;hing between Prejudices and Errors, is a prevailing Over&s;ight among our modern Free-Thinkers.</P>
<P>THERE may be indeed certain mere Pre|judices or Opinions, which, having no Rea|&s;ons either a&s;&s;igned or a&s;&s;ignable to &s;upport them, are neverthele&s;s entertained by the Mind, becau&s;e they intruded betimes into it. Such may be &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;e, not becau&s;e they were early learned, or learned without their Rea&s;ons; but becau&s;e there are in Truth no Rea&s;ons to be given for them.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, if a Notion may be con|cluded fal&s;e, becau&s;e it was early imbibed, or becau&s;e it is with mo&s;t Men an Object of Belief rather than of Knowledge, one may by the &s;ame Rea&s;oning conclude &s;everal Propo&s;itions of <HI>Euclid</HI> to be fal&s;e. A &s;im|ple Apprehen&s;ion of Conclu&s;ions as taken in them&s;elves, without the Deductions of Sci|ence, is what falls to the Share of Mankind in general. Religious Awe, the Precepts of Parents and Ma&s;ters, the Wi&s;dom of Legi|&s;lators, and the accumulated Experience of Ages, &s;upply the Place of Proofs and Rea|&s;onings with the Vulgar of all Ranks: I would &s;ay, that Di&s;cipline, national Con|&s;titution,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
and Laws Humane or Divine, are &s;o many plain Land-Marks which guide them into the Paths wherein it is pre&s;umed they ought to tread.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been premi&s;ed, it plain|ly appears, that in the Bulk of Mankind there are, and mu&s;t be Prejudices; that is, Opinions taken upon Tru&s;t; or in other Words, that there are Points of Faith a|mong all Men what&s;oever, as well as a|mong Chri&s;tians. And as it is evident, that the unthinking Part of every Age, Sex, and Condition among us, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re|ceive Notions with the Submi&s;&s;ion of Faith, &s;o it is very rea&s;onable that they &s;hould &s;ub|mit their Faith to the greate&s;t Authorities Humane and Divine, the Law and the Go&s;|pel. But if once all Reverence for the&s;e be de&s;troyed, our Pretenders to moral Know|ledge will have no Authority to imbue the Multitude with &s;uch Notions as may con|troll their Appetites. From all which it follows, that the modern Schemes of our Free-Thinkers, who pretend to &s;eparate Morality from Religion, how rational &s;o|ever they may &s;eem to their Admirers, are in Truth and Effect mo&s;t irrational and per|nicious to civil Society.</P>
<P>LET any one, who thinks at all, con&s;ider the Savage State of undi&s;ciplined Men, who&s;e Minds are nurtured to no Doctrine, broke by no In&s;truction, governed by no
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Principle. Let him at the &s;ame Time re|flect on a Society of Per&s;ons educated in the Principles of our Church, formed betimes to fear God, to reverence their Superiors, to be grateful to their Benefactors, forgiv|ing to their Enemies, ju&s;t and charitable to all Men; and he will then be able to judge of the Merits of tho&s;e who are &s;o active to weed out the Prejudices of Education.</P>
<P>AMONG the many wild Notions broached in the&s;e giddy Times, it mu&s;t be owned that &s;ome of our Declaimers again&s;t Prejudice, have wrought them&s;elves into a Sort of E|&s;teem for Savages, as a virtuous and unpre|judiced People. In Proof of which, they alledge their being free from many Vices practi&s;ed in civilized Nations. To which I an&s;wer, that it is very true, among Savages there are few In&s;tances to be found of Lux|ury, Avarice, or Ambition; not that the contrary Virtues take Place, but becau&s;e the Opportunities and Faculties for &s;uch Vices, are wanting. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, you do not &s;ee them in Brutes.</P>
<P>WHAT they e&s;teem and admire in tho&s;e Creatures is not Innocence, but Ignorance; it is not Virtue, but Nece&s;&s;ity. Give them but the Means of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing, and they know no Bounds. For Example: Supply the Water-drinking Savage with &s;trong Li|quor, and he &s;hall be drunk for &s;everal Days and Nights together. Again; we
<PB N="15" REF="14">
admit an uneducated Savage knows not how to &s;upplant a Rival with the refined Trea|chery of a Courtier; yet, if you put his Foe once in his Power, you &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee what a horrible Reli&s;h and Delight the Mon&s;ter hath in Cruelty.</P>
<P>ABOVE all others, religious Notions, or if you will, Prejudices, (&s;ince this, as hath been already ob&s;erved, detracts nothing from their Truth and U&s;efulne&s;s) have the mo&s;t Influence, they are the &s;tronge&s;t Curb from Vice, and the mo&s;t effectual Spur to worthy Conduct. And indeed, whether we con&s;ider the Rea&s;on of Things, or the Prac|tice of Men in all Times, we &s;hall be &s;ati&s;|fied, that nothing truly great, and good, can enter into the Heart of one attached to no Principles of Religion, who believes no Providence, who neither fears Hell, nor hopes for Heaven.</P>
<P>PUNISHMENTS and Rewards have always had, and always will have the greate&s;t Weight with Men; and as the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable of both Kinds are propo&s;ed by Re|ligion, the Duties whereof fall in with the Views of the civil Magi&s;trate; it undenia|bly follows, that nothing can add more Strength to a good and righteous Govern|ment, than Religion. Therefore it mainly concerns Governors to keep an attentive Eye on the Religion of their Subjects. And indeed, it is one Le&s;&s;on to Magi&s;trate and
<PB N="16" REF="15">
People, Prince and Subject: <HI>Keep my Com|mandments and live, and my Law as the Ap|ple of thine Eye.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>PROV. Ch. vii. Ver. 3.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is no Con&s;equence from what hath been &s;aid, that Men &s;hould be debarred the free U&s;e of Rea&s;on and Inqui|ry; yet, &s;urely it will follow, that without good Rea&s;on, a Man &s;hould not reject tho&s;e Notions which have been in&s;tilled by the Laws and Education of his Country. And even they who think they have &s;uch Rea&s;on, have neverthele&s;s no Right of dic|tating to others. It is true, a Commi&s;&s;ion from Heaven is &s;uperior to all humane Pre|judices, In&s;titutions, and Regards what&s;o|ever. And it is wi&s;e, although at the Ri&s;que of Liberty, or Life, to obey God rather than Man. But our modern Refor|mers of Prejudice, have nothing to plead of that Kind.</P>
<P>THERE is no Magi&s;trate &s;o ignorant as not to know that Power, phy&s;ical Power, re&s;ides in the People; but Authority is from Opinion, which Authority is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train and direct the People's Power, and therefore Religion is the great Stay and Support of a State. Every Religion that inculcates Virtue, and di&s;courageth Vice, is &s;o far of publick Benefit. The Chri&s;tian Religion doth not only do this, but further
<PB N="17" REF="16">
makes every legal Con&s;titution &s;acred by commanding our Submi&s;&s;ion thereto. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the higher Powers,</HI> &s;aith St. PAUL, <HI>for the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>ROM. Ch. xiii. Ver. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> And in Effect for &s;eve|veral Years pa&s;t, while the Reverence for our Church and Religion, hath been decaying and wearing off from the Minds of Men, it may be ob&s;erved, that Loyalty hath in Proportion lo&s;t Ground; and now the very Word &s;eems quite forgotten. Submi&s;&s;ion for Con&s;cience, as well as for Wrath, was once reckoned an u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on; but now, with other good Le&s;&s;ons is laid a&s;ide as an ob&s;olete Prejudice.</P>
<P>THAT Prince or Magi&s;trate, however great or powerful, who thinks his own Au|thority &s;ufficient to make him re&s;pected and obeyed, lies under a woful Mi&s;take, and never &s;ails to feel it &s;ooner or later. O|bedience to all civil Power is rooted in the religious Fear of God: It is propagated, pre&s;erved, and nouri&s;hed by Religion. This makes Men obey, not with Eye-Service, but in Sincerity of Heart. Humane Re|gards may re&s;train Men from open and pe|nal Offences; but the Fear of God is a Re|&s;traint from all Degrees of all Crimes how|ever circum&s;tanced. Take away this Stay and Prop of Duty, this Root of civil Au|thority;
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and all that grew from it &s;hall &s;oon langui&s;h. The Authority, the very Being of the Magi&s;trate, will prove a poor and precarious Thing.</P>
<P>AN inward Sen&s;e of the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of the King of Kings, is the only Thing that can beget and pre&s;erve a true Re&s;pect for &s;ubordinate Maje&s;ty in all the Degrees of Power, the fir&s;t Link of Authority being fixed at the Throne of God. But in the&s;e our Days, that <HI>Maje&s;tas imperii,</HI> that Sa|credne&s;s of Character, which rooted in a religious Principle, was the great Guard and Security of the State, is through Want thereof become the publick Scorn. And indeed, what Hold can the Prince or Ma|gi&s;trate have on the Con&s;cience of tho&s;e who have no Con&s;cience? How can he build on the Principles of &s;uch as have no Principles? Or how can he hope for Re&s;|pect where God him&s;elf is neglected?</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, that no Prince upon Earth can hope to govern well, or even to live ea&s;y and &s;ecure, much le&s;s re&s;pected by his People, if he do not contribute by his Ex|ample and Authority, to keep up in their Minds an awful Sen&s;e of Religion. As for a moral Sen&s;e, and moral Fitne&s;s, or eternal Relations, how in&s;ufficient tho&s;e Things are for e&s;tabli&s;hing general and ju&s;t Notions of Morality, or for keeping Men within due Bounds, is &s;o evident from Fact
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and Experience, that I need not now enter into a particular Di&s;qui&s;ition about them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>ALCIPHRON, Dial. III. and Dial. VI.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, that the Claws of Rapine and Violence, may in &s;ome Degree be pared and blunted by the outward Po|lity of a State. But &s;hould we not rather try, if po&s;&s;ible, to pull them quite out? The Evil Effects of Wickedne&s;s may be of|ten redre&s;&s;ed by publick Ju&s;tice. But would it not be better to heal the Source; and by an inward Principle extirpate Wickedne&s;s from the Heart, rather than depend altoge|ther on humane Laws for preventing or re|dre&s;&s;ing the bad Effects thereof? <Q>I might (&s;aid the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Doctor <HI>Confucius</HI>) hear and decide Controver&s;ies as well as another: But what I would have is, that Men &s;hould be brought to ab&s;tain from Controver&s;ies, out of an inward Love and Regard for each other.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Scientia SIN.

<P>Too many in this Age of free Remarks, and Projects, are delighted with Republi|can Schemes, and imagine they might re|medy whatever was ami&s;s, and render a People great and happy, merely by a new Plan or Form of Government. This dan|gerous Way of thinking and talking, is grown familiar, through the fooli&s;h Free|dom
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of the Times. But alas! Tho&s;e Men do not &s;eem to have touched either the true Cau&s;e or Cure of publick Evils: Be the Plan ever &s;o excellent, or the Architects e|ver &s;o able, yet no Man in his Wits would undertake to build a Palace with mere Mud or Dirt of the Streets. There mu&s;t be fit Materials; and without a religious Princi|ple, Men can never be fit Materials for any Society, much le&s;s for a Republique. Re|ligion is the Centre which unites, and the Cement which connects the &s;everal Parts or Members of the political Body.

<P>BUT many among us, who would pa&s;s for A&s;&s;erters of Truth and Liberty, are ac|cu&s;tomed to rail at this, and all other e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Opinions, as Prejudices which People are taught whether they will or no, and be|fore they are able to di&s;tingui&s;h whether they are right or wrong. The&s;e Lovers of Truth would do well to con&s;ider, that in political, moral, and religious Matters, the Opinions of the Vulgar, whether they go in Coaches, or walk on Foot, are for the mo&s;t Part Prejudices; and are &s;o like to be, whatever Side of the Que&s;tion they em|brace; whether they follow the old Max|ims of the Religion of their Country, or the modern In&s;tructions of their new Ma&s;ters. I have already ob&s;erved, that a Point being u&s;eful, and inculcated betimes, can be no Argument of its Fal&s;hood, even although it &s;hould be a Prejudice; far otherwi&s;e, U|tility and Truth are not to be divided; the general Good of Mankind, being the Rule or Mea&s;ure of moral Truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>ALCIPHRON, Dial.

<P>I SHALL now add, that it is to be appre|hended, many of tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t forward to bani&s;h Prejudices, would be the fir&s;t to feel the Want of them. It is even pitiful to think, what would become of cer|tain modern Declaimers on that Article, were Prejudice really &s;et a&s;ide, and were all Men to be weighed in the exact Scale of Merit, and con&s;idered in Proportion only to their intrin&s;ic Worth. Some Prejudices
<PB N="23" REF="22">
are grounded in Truth, Rea&s;on, and Nature. Such are the Re&s;pects which are paid to Knowledge, Learning, Age, Hone&s;ty, and Courage in all civilized Countries. Others are purely the Effect of particular Con&s;titutions, &s;uch as the Re&s;pects, Rights, and Prehe|minencies a&s;cribed to &s;ome Men by their Fellow-Subjects, on Account of their Birth and Quality; which in the great Empires of <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> pa&s;s for nothing; and will pa&s;s for nothing el&s;ewhere, as &s;oon as Men have got rid of their Prejudices, and learned to de&s;pi&s;e the Con&s;titutions of their Country. It may behove tho&s;e who are concerned, to reflect on this betimes.</P>
<P>GOD, comprehending within him&s;elf, the Beginning, End, and Middle of all Things and Times, exerts his Energy throughout the whole Creation. He never cea&s;eth to influence by In&s;tinct, by the Light of Nature, by his declared Will. And it is the Duty of Magi&s;trates and Law-givers, to cultivate and encourage tho&s;e divine Im|pre&s;&s;ions in the Minds of all Men under their Care. We are not to think, it is the Work of God, and therefore not to be &s;e|conded by humane Care. Far otherwi&s;e, for that very Rea&s;on it claims our utmo&s;t Care and Diligence, it being the indi&s;pen&s;i|ble Duty of all good Men, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives, to co-operate with the De&s;igns of Providence.

<P>AND if Religion in all Governments be nece&s;&s;ary, yet it &s;eemeth to be &s;o more e&s;|pecially in Monarchies: Fora&s;much as the frugal Manners, and more equal Fortunes in Republiques, do not &s;o much inflame Men's Appetites, or afford &s;uch Power or Temptation to Mi&s;chief, as the high E&s;tate and great Wealth of Nobles under a King. Therefore, although the Magi&s;trate, (as was already ob&s;erved) hath for his peculiar Object, the temporal Well-being of the State;
<PB N="25" REF="24">
yet this will by no Means exempt him from a due Concern for the Religion of his Country.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Sen&s;e of our Ance&s;tors on this Point, appears throughout the whole Con&s;titution of the&s;e Kingdoms; and in or|der to ju&s;tify this Con&s;titution, and the Wi&s;|dom of tho&s;e who framed it, I &s;hall crave Leave to make U&s;e of &s;ome un&s;u&s;pected Te&s;timonies ancient and modern, which will &s;hew, that the publick Care of a nati|onal Religion, hath been always a mo&s;t principal Point in the E&s;teem of wi&s;e Men, however run down by the prevailing Licence of our Times.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Te&s;timony I &s;hall produce, is that of <HI>Zaleucus,</HI> the famous Law-giver of the <HI>Locrians</HI>; who in the Preamble to his Laws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>STOBAEUS de leg. &amp; con&s;uet.

<P>AND here, by the Bye, I &s;hall take No|tice that &s;ome may imagine, the various Forms and In&s;titutions of Religion ought to un&s;ettle Men's Minds, with regard to the Truth and Certainty of any. But this Mat|ter rightly con&s;idered, will, I think, pro|duce a contrary Effect. It &s;heweth, indeed, that Men groping out their Way, by the dim Twylight of Nature did only approach, &s;ome nearer, &s;ome farther off, although all were &s;hort of the Truth. But then it &s;hew|eth likewi&s;e upon the Whole, and in Gene|ral, that Religion is &s;o natural to our Minds, &s;o u&s;eful to Society, and of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary Im|portance to the World, as might well prove its Truth, and render it worthy of the Di|vine Care to propagate by Prophecies, Mi|racles, and the Mi&s;&s;ion of the Son of God.</P>

I will an&s;wer this Que&s;tion, by asking when were our Neighbours known to abound to that Degree in Highwaymen, Murderers, Hou&s;e-breakers, Incendiaries? When did &s;uch Numbers lay violent Hands on them|&s;elves? When was there &s;uch a general and indecent Contempt of whatever is e&s;teemed Sacred, in the State as well as the Church? When were there known among them &s;uch publick Frauds, &s;uch open Confederacies in Villainy, as the pre&s;ent Age hath produced? When were they lower in the E&s;teem of Mankind, more divided at home, or more in&s;ulted abroad?</P>
<P>WE of this Land have a fatal Tendency to overlook the good Qualities, and imitate whatever is ami&s;s in tho&s;e whom we re&s;pect. This leads me to make &s;ome Remarks on the modern Spirit of Reformation, that works &s;o &s;trongly in both the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>FREEDOM of Thought is the general Plea and Cry of the Age; and we all grant, that thinking is the Way to know; and the
<PB N="31" REF="30">
more real Knowledge there is in the Land, the more likely it will be to thrive. We are not therefore again&s;t Freedom of Thought, but we are again&s;t tho&s;e unthink|ing overbearing People, who, in the&s;e odd Times, under that Pretence, &s;et up for Re|formers, and new Moulders of the Con&s;ti|tution. We declare again&s;t tho&s;e, who would &s;educe ignorant and unexperienced Per&s;ons from the Reverence they owe to the Laws and Religion of their Country; and under the Notion of extirpating Preju|dices, would era&s;e from their Minds all Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Piety and Virtue, in order to introduce Prejudices of another Kind, de|&s;tructive of Society.</P>

<P>IT may be pre&s;umed, that the Science of finding Fault, which above all others is ea|&s;ie&s;t to learn, &s;uits be&s;t with a modern Edu|cation. Too many there are of better For|tunes than Under&s;tandings, who have made the Inquiry after Truth, a very &s;mall Part of their Care: The&s;e &s;ee &s;omewhat, but not enough. It were to be wi&s;hed, they knew either le&s;s or more. One Thing it is evident they do not know; to wit; that while they rail at Prejudice, they are undo|ing them&s;elves: They do not comprehend, (what hath been before hinted) that their whole Figure, their political Exi&s;tence, is owing to certain vulgar Prejudices, in Fa|vour of Birth, Title, or Fortune, which add nothing of real Worth either to Mind
<PB N="33" REF="32">
or Body; and yet, cau&s;e the mo&s;t worth|le&s;s Per&s;on to be re&s;pected.</P>
<P>FREEDOM of Thought is the Prerogative of humane Kind: It is a Quality inherent in the very Nature of a thinking Being. Nothing is more evident, than that every one can think his own Way, in &s;pite of any outward Force or Power what&s;oever. It is therefore ridiculous for any Man to declaim in Defence of a Privilege, which, if he holds his Tongue, cannot be denied or taken from him: But this will not infer a boundle&s;s Freedom of Speech, an open Contempt of Laws, and a &s;etting up of private Judgment again&s;t public Authority, Things never born in any well-ordered State; and which make the crying Di&s;temper of our Times.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;titution of the&s;e Kingdoms, hath been one while over-heated by the in|di&s;creet Zeal of one Set of Men: Again, it hath been cold and lifele&s;s, through the In|difference of another. We have alternately felt the furious Effects of Super&s;tition and Fanatici&s;m; and our pre&s;ent impending Danger, is from the &s;etting up of private Judgment, or an inward Light, in Oppo&s;i|tion to humane and divine Laws. Such an inward &s;elfi&s;h Principle, always at work, and proceeding gradually and &s;teadily, may be &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve any humane Fabric of Polity or civil Government. To pretend
<PB N="34" REF="33">
to be wi&s;er than the Laws, hath never been &s;uffered in any wi&s;e State, &s;aith <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rhet. Lib. I.

Who can &s;ay to &s;uch a Spirit, <HI>Thus far &s;halt thou come, and no farther?</HI></P>
<P>THE Magi&s;trate, perhaps, may not be &s;ufficiently aware, that tho&s;e earne&s;t Con|tenders for private Light, and free Thought, are in reality &s;editious Men, who &s;et up them&s;elves again&s;t national Laws and Con|&s;titutions. And yet, one would think, all Mankind might &s;ee, that the Spirit which prevails again&s;t the Church and Religion, proceeds from an Oppo&s;ition rather to the Laws of the Land, than to the Go&s;pel. Men quarrel not &s;o vehemently again&s;t Ar|ticles of Faith them&s;elves, as again&s;t the e|&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;uch Matters; which is the &s;ole Effect of Law and the &s;upreme Power. It clearly follows, the Freedom pleaded for is not &s;o much Freedom of Thought again&s;t the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, as Freedom of Speech and Action again&s;t the Laws of the Land. It is &s;trange, that tho&s;e who are not blind in other Matters, &s;hould yet not &s;ee this; or, that &s;eeing it, they &s;hould not di&s;cern the Con&s;equences thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
I AM &s;en&s;ible, that whatever looks like a Re&s;traint on Freedom of Inquiry, mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable to all rea&s;oning and inqui|&s;itive Men. But again&s;t this, I have &s;aid nothing. On the contrary, I will freely own, a judicious and impartial Search after Truth, is the mo&s;t valuable Employment of the Mind. Tho&s;e who have the Talents, and will be at the Pains, cannot do better than engage in that noble Pur&s;uit: But tho&s;e who are not qualified by Age or Edu|cation; tho&s;e who have neither Di&s;po&s;ition nor Lei&s;ure, nor Faculties to dig in the Mine of Truth them&s;elves, mu&s;t take it as retailed out by others. I &s;ee no Remedy. GOD who knows the Opportunities of every Man, requires Impo&s;&s;ibilities from no Man. And where there is a &s;incere Love of Truth and Virtue; the Grace of God can ea&s;ily &s;upply the Defect of humane Means.</P>
<P>IT hath been before ob&s;erved, and &s;hew|ed at large, that the Bulk of Mankind mu&s;t have their Minds betimes imbued with good and whole&s;ome Notions or Principles by their Parents, Pa&s;tors, and Tutors, or el&s;e bad Notions, hurtful to them&s;elves and o|thers, will undoubtedly take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there|of. Such bad Notions have, for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, been propagated with uncom|mon Indu&s;try in the&s;e Kingdoms: They now bring forth Fruit every Day more and
<PB N="36" REF="35">
more abundant. It is to be feared, that what hath been long ripening, is now near ripe. Many are the Signs and Tokens. He that runs, may read.</P>
<P>BUT there cannot be a higher, or more flagrant Symptom of the Madne&s;s of our Times, than that execrable Fraternity of Bla&s;phemers, lately &s;et up within this City of <HI>Dublin.</HI> Bla&s;phemy again&s;t GOD, is a great Crime again&s;t the State. But that a Set of Men &s;hould, in open Contempt of the Laws, make this very Crime their Profe&s;&s;ion, di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by a peculiar Name,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bla&s;ters.</NOTE> and form a di&s;tinct Society, whereof the proper and avowed Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be, to &s;hock all &s;erious Chri&s;tians by the mo&s;t im|pious and horrid Bla&s;phemies, uttered in the mo&s;t publick Manner. This &s;urely mu&s;t alarm all thinking Men. It is a new Thing under the Sun re&s;erved for our worthy Times and Country.</P>
<P>IT is no common Bla&s;phemy I &s;peak of: It is not &s;imple Cur&s;ing and Swearing: It is not the Effect either of Habit or Surprize; but a Train of &s;tudied deliberate Indignities again&s;t the Divine Maje&s;ty; and tho&s;e, of &s;o black and helli&s;h a Kind, as the Tongues alone which uttered them, can duly charac|terize

and expre&s;s. This is no &s;peculative Here&s;y, no remote or doubtful Inference from an Author's Tenets. It is a direct and open Attack on GOD him&s;elf. It is &s;uch a calm premeditated In&s;ult upon Religion, Law, and the very Light of Nature, that there is no Sect or Nation of Men, whether Chri&s;tians, Jews, Mahometans, or even ci|vilized Heathens, that would not be &s;truck with Horror and Amazement at the Thought of it, and that would not animadvert on its Authors with the utmo&s;t Severity.</P>
<P>DELIBERATE, athei&s;tical Bla&s;phemy, is of all Crimes mo&s;t dangerous to the Public, ina&s;much as it opens the Door to all other Crimes, and virtually contains them all. A religious Awe and Fear of GOD, being (as we have already ob&s;erved) the Centre that unites, and the Cement that connects all hu|mane Society, He, who makes it his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, to le&s;&s;en or root out from the Minds of Men this Principle, doth in Effect, en|deavour to fill his Country with Highway|men, Hou&s;e-breakers, Murderers, fraudu|lent Dealers, perjured Witne&s;&s;es, and every other Pe&s;t of Society. Therefore, it would be the greate&s;t Cruelty to our Children, Neighbours, and Country, to connive at &s;uch a Crime; a Crime! which has no na|tural Pa&s;&s;ion or Temptation to plead for it, but is the pure Effect of an abandoned Im|pudence
<PB N="38" REF="37">
in Wickedne&s;s; and, perhaps, of a mi&s;taken Hope, that the Laws and Magi|&s;trates are a&s;leep.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion is not now, whether Reli|gion &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law: The Thing is already done, (and done with good Rea&s;on, as appeareth from the Premi&s;&s;es) but whether a Reverence for the Laws &s;hall be pre&s;erved. Religion con&s;idered as a Sy&s;|tem of &s;aving Truths, hath its Sanction from Heaven; its Rewards and Penalties are Di|vine. But Religion, as u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;a|ry to Society, hath been wi&s;ely e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law; and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, and wrought into the very Frame and Principles of our Government, is become a main Part of the civil Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>OUR Laws, are the Laws of a Chri&s;tian Country: Our Government hath been con|&s;tituted and modelled by Chri&s;tians; and is &s;till admini&s;tred and maintained by Men profe&s;&s;ing Belief in CHRIST. Can it then be &s;uppo&s;ed, that impious Men &s;hall with Im|punity, invent and publickly utter the mo&s;t horrid Bla&s;phemies; and at the &s;ame Time, the whole Con&s;titution not be endangered? Or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Magi&s;trates, or Men inve&s;ted with Power, &s;hould look on, and &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;acred Part of our Con&s;ti|tution trampled under Foot, and yet ima|gine
<PB N="39" REF="38">
their own Dignity and Authority to be &s;ecure, which re&s;t intirely thereupon?</P>
<P>I WILL venture to &s;ay, that whoever is a wi&s;e Man, and a Lover of his Country, will not only be &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve the Honour of GOD &s;acred and intire; he will even di&s;courage that prevailing Prejudice a|gain&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ers of GOD's Word, the Teachers of tho&s;e Salutary Doctrines, with|out which the Public cannot thrive or &s;ub|&s;i&s;t. He will be no Contemner, not even of tho&s;e Rites and Ordinances enjoined by Law, as nece&s;&s;ary to imprint and retain a Sen&s;e of Religion in the Minds of Men. He will extend his Care to the Outworks, as know|ing that when the&s;e are gone, it may be difficult to pre&s;erve the re&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the vain A&s;&s;ertion of tho&s;e Men, who would ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent, by &s;aying <HI>all Times are alike,</HI> it is mo&s;t evi|dent, that the Magi&s;trates, the Laws, the very Con&s;titution of the&s;e Realms, have lo&s;t no &s;mall Share of their Authority and Re|verence, &s;ince this great Growth and &s;pread|ing of impious Principles. What&s;oever be the Cau&s;e, the Effect is apparent. Whe|ther we a&s;cribe it to the natural Cour&s;e of Things, or to a ju&s;t Judgment upon tho&s;e who, having been carele&s;s to pre&s;erve a due Sen&s;e of the divine Authority, have &s;een and &s;hall &s;ee their own de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>

<HI>DARIUS,</HI> a Heathen Prince, made a Decree, that in every Dominion of his King|dom, Men &s;hould tremble and fear before GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>DAN. Ch. VI.

Now, a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of disfavour from Men in Authority, would prove a mo&s;t effectual Check to all &s;uch Mi&s;creants. When there|fore they are public and bold in their Bla&s;|phemies, this is no &s;mall Reflection on tho&s;e who might check them if they would.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;o much the Execution of the Laws, as the Countenance of tho&s;e in Au|thority, that is wanting to the Maintenance of Religion. If Men of Rank and Power, who have a Share in di&s;tributing Ju&s;tice, and a Voice in the publick Councils, &s;hall be ob&s;erved to neglect divine Wor&s;hip
<PB N="41" REF="40">
them&s;elves, it mu&s;t needs be a great Temp|tation for others to do the &s;ame. But if they, and their Families, &s;hould &s;et a good Example, it may be pre&s;umed, that Men of le&s;s Figure would be di&s;po&s;ed to follow it. Fa&s;hions are always ob&s;erved to de|&s;cend, and People are generally fond of being in the Fa&s;hion, whence one would be apt to &s;u&s;pect, the prevailing Contempt of GOD's Word, and e&s;trangement from his Hou&s;e, to a Degree that was never known in any Chri&s;tian Country, mu&s;t take its Ri&s;e from the Irreligion and bad Example of tho&s;e who are &s;tyled <HI>the better Sort.</HI></P>
<P>OFFENCES mu&s;t come, but Woe be to him, by whom the Offence cometh. A Man who is entru&s;ted with Power and In|fluence in his Country, hath much to an|&s;wer for, if Religion and Virtue &s;uffer through Want of his Authority and Coun|tenance. But in Ca&s;e he &s;hould, by the Vanity of his Di&s;cour&s;e, his Favour to wicked Men, or his own apparent Ne|glect of all religious Duties, countenance what he ought to condemn, and authorize by his own Example, what he ought to puni&s;h; &s;uch a one, whatever he may pre|tend, is in Fact a bad Patriot, a bad Citi|zen, and a bad Subject, as well as a bad Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>OUR Pro&s;pect is very terrible, and the
<PB N="42" REF="41">
Symptoms grow &s;tronger every Day. The Morals of a People are in this like their Fortunes; when they feel a national Shock, the wor&s;t doth not &s;hew it&s;elf immediately. Things make a Shift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for a Time, on the Credit of old Notions and dying O|pinions. But the Youth born and brought up in wicked Times, without any Byas to good from early Principle, or in&s;tilled O|pinion, when they grow ripe mu&s;t be Mon|&s;ters indeed. And it is to be feared that Age of Mon&s;ters is not far off.</P>
<P>WHENCE this Impiety &s;prings, by what Means it gains Ground among us, and how it may be remedied, are Matters that de|&s;erve the Attention of all tho&s;e who have Power and Will to &s;erve their Country. And although many Things look like a Prelude to &s;ome general Ruin; although it is much to be apprehended, we &s;hall be wor&s;e be|fore we are better; yet who knows what may en&s;ue, if all Per&s;ons in Power, from the &s;upreme Executor of the Law, down to a petty Con&s;table, would, in their &s;eve|ral Stations beheave them&s;elves like Men, truly con&s;cious and mindful, that the Au|thority they are cloathed with, is but a de|rivative Ray from the &s;upreme Authority of Heaven? This may not a little con|tribute to &s;tem that Torrent, which from &s;mall Beginnings, and under &s;pecious Pre|tences,
