<P>_WELL, <HI>Cloris,</HI> this is a mad Frolick. I am horridly frighted at the Thoughts of throwing my &s;elf into the Power of a young Fellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is natural to us to be frighted at fir&s;t: I was in a little Terror my &s;elf on my Wedding-Day, but it went all off before the next Morning; a Husband, like other Bugbears, lo&s;es all his Horror when we once know him thoroughly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he &s;hould not prove a good Husband&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you mu&s;t not prove a good Wife&mdash;If he keeps a Mi&s;tre&s;s, do you keep a Gallant; if he

&s;tay out with his Friends at a Tavern, do you be merry with your Friends at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You give fine Advice indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, it was &s;uch as I fol|lowed my &s;elf. I had a Rogue of a Husband that robbed me of all I had, and kept a Mi&s;tre&s;s under my No&s;e: but I was even with him: for it hath been ever my Opinion that a Husband, like a Courtier, who is above doing the Duties of his Office, &s;hould keep a Deputy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e you had been in Love with your Husband?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o I was, Madam, as long as he de&s;erved it: but Love, like Fire, naturally goes out when it hath nothing to feed on.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it be po&s;&s;ible to be a&s;&s;ured of a Lover's Sincerity, I think I may be a&s;&s;ured of <HI>Con&s;tant:</HI> at lea&s;t it is advi&s;eable to per&s;uade my &s;elf of his Truth whom I &s;hould Love, tho' he wanted it:&mdash;Ah, <HI>Cloris!</HI> you may as ea&s;ily remove a Rock as a Woman's Pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet it is very often built on a &s;andy Foun|dation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love is the &s;ame, whatever be its Object: We as often like Men for imaginary as real Perfections; we all look through a Pri&s;matick Gla&s;s in Love, and whatever Beauties we have once fancied, we never lo&s;e the Opinion of&mdash;our Amorous Faith is as implicit as our Religious.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clo.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have any Judgment in Mankind, and I am &s;ure I have had &s;ome Experince in them, your Pa&s;&s;ion could have been no where better fixed: Capt. <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> hath all the Qualities any Woman can de&s;ire.

<P>Well&mdash;But now let me have the Hi&s;tory&mdash;Where did your Amour begin&mdash;at Church, I warrant you: more Amours begin at Church than end there.&mdash;Or perhaps, you went to &s;ee the Man of War&mdash;Going to &s;ee Sights hath ruined many a Wo|man.

<P>Well, and was the Amour managed by Let|ter, or by word of Mouth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Letter, Sir. I believe he writ two Quires of Paper to me before I would &s;end him an An&s;wer, I returned him &s;everal un-opened, and then &s;everal o|thers opened&mdash;But at la&s;t&mdash;he obtained an An|&s;wer.</P>

<P>Well, and after your An&s;wer, what followed then?</P>

</SP>

<P>Ay, I have always ob&s;erved in my Amours, that when I received an An&s;wer, I never failed of the Woman; a Woman follows her Letter infallibly: well, and what did he &s;ay in the &s;econd Letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! he &s;wore a thou&s;and fond things, that his Love &s;hould la&s;t as long as his Life. That his whole Happine&s;s depended on me&mdash;and a va&s;t deal of that Nature.</P>

I in the greate&s;t Agony of Rage repelled him with my utmo&s;t Force; he redoubled his Attacks, I &s;lackened my Re&s;i&s;tance; he entreated, I raved; he &s;ighed, I cry'd; he pre&s;&s;ed, I &s;wooned; he&mdash;</P>

<P>SURE, never Child inherited le&s;s of a Father's Di&s;po&s;ition than mine; her Mother certainly played me foul in the begetting her: I, who have been my whole Life noted for Sobriety, could ne|ver have given Being to &s;o wild a Creature: I begin to recollect having &s;een a tall Half-pay Officer at my Hou&s;e formerly: Nor do I think the Girl unlike him. I am &s;ure &s;he hath been ever wild enough, to have had any Officer in the Kingdom for her Father. Nature hath been kind to the Male of all Creatures but Man: The Bull, the Hor&s;e, the Dog are not encumbered even with their own Off-&s;pring; that Care falls only to the Females: But Man, when once a gabling Prie&s;t hath chattered a few mi&s;chievous Words over him, is bound to have and to hold from that Day forward all the Brats his Wife is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on him. Yet I mu&s;t own the Girl hath been ever dutiful to me, till &s;he became acquainted with this cur&s;ed Fellow in a Red Coat. Why &s;hould Red have &s;uch Charms in the Eyes of a Woman? The <HI>Roman</HI> Senate kept their Armies abroad to prevent their &s;haring in their Lands at home, we &s;hould do the &s;ame to prevent their &s;ha|ring in our Wives.
