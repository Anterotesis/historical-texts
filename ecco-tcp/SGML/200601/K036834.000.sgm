<BIBL>EPHESIANS, IV. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q>AND HE GAVE SOME, APOSTLES; AND SOME, PROPHETS; AND SOME, EVANGELISTS; AND SOME, PASTORS AND TEACHERS; FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS, FOR THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY, FOR THE EDIFY|ING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN our rea&s;oning and di&s;cour&s;es upon the rules and nature of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, there is no di&s;tinction which ought to be pre&s;erved with greater care, than that, which exi&s;ts between the in&s;titution, as it addre&s;&s;es the con&s;cience and regulates the duty of particular Chri&s;tians, and as it regards the di&s;cipline and government of the Chri&s;tian church. It was our Saviour's de&s;ign and the fir&s;t object of his mini&s;try, to afford to a lo&s;t and ignorant world &s;uch di&s;coveries of their Creator's will, of their own intere&s;t, and future de&s;tination; &s;uch a&s;&s;ured principles of faith, and rules of practice; &s;uch new motives, terms, and means of obedience, as might enable all, and engage many, to enter upon a cour&s;e of life, which by rendering the per&s;on who
<PB N="6" REF="3">
pur&s;ued it acceptable to God, would conduct him to happi|ne&s;s, in another &s;tage of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IT was a &s;econd intention of the founder of Chri&s;tianity, but &s;ub&s;ervient to the former, to a&s;&s;ociate tho&s;e who con|&s;ented to take upon them the profe&s;&s;ion of his faith and &s;ervice, into a &s;eparate community, for the purpo&s;e of united wor&s;hip and mutual edification, for the better tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion and manife&s;tation of the faith that was delivered to them, but principally, to promote the exerci&s;e of that fra|ternal di&s;po&s;ition which their new relation to each other, which the vi&s;ible participation of the &s;ame name and hope and calling, was calculated to excite.</P>
<P>FROM a view of the&s;e di&s;tinct parts of the evangelic di&s;pen&s;ation, we are led to place a real difference, between the religion of particular Chri&s;tians, and the polity of Chri&s;t's church. The one is per&s;onal and individual&mdash;acknowledges no &s;ubjection to human authority&mdash;is tran&s;acted in the heart&mdash;is an account between God and our own con&s;ciences alone: the other, appertaining to &s;ociety (like every thing which relates to the joint intere&s;t and requires the co-ope|ration of many per&s;ons) is vi&s;ible and external&mdash;pre&s;cribes rules of common order, for the ob&s;ervation of which, we are re&s;pon&s;ible not only to God, but to the &s;ociety of which we are members, or what is the &s;ame thing, to tho&s;e with whom the public authority of the &s;ociety is depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>BUT the difference which I am principally concerned to e&s;tabli&s;h con&s;i&s;ts in this, that whil&s;t the precepts of Chri&s;tian morality and the fundamental articles of its faith are, for
<PB N="7" REF="4">
the mo&s;t part, preci&s;e and ab&s;olute, are of perpetual, uni|ver&s;al, and unalterable obligation; the laws which re&s;pect the di&s;cipline, in&s;truction, and government of the commu|nity, are delivered in terms &s;o general and indefinite as to admit of an application adapted to the mutable condition and varying exigencies of the Chri&s;tian church. "As my Father hath &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you." "Let every thing be done decently and in order." "Lay hands &s;uddenly on no man." "Let him that ruleth do it with diligence." "The things which thou ha&s;t heard of me, the &s;ame commit thou to faithful men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o." "For this cau&s;e left I thee that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;et in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city."</P>
<P>THESE are all general directions, &s;uppo&s;ing indeed the exi&s;tence of a regular mini&s;try in the church, but de&s;cribing no &s;pecific order of pre-eminence or di&s;tribution of office and authority. If any other in&s;tances can be adduced more circum&s;tantial than the&s;e, they will be found like the ap|pointment of the &s;even deacons, the collections for the &s;aints, the laying by in &s;tore upon the fir&s;t day of the week, to be rules of the &s;ociety rather than laws of the religion&mdash;recommendations and expedients fitted to the &s;tate of the &s;everal churches by tho&s;e who then admini&s;tered the affairs of them, rather than precepts delivered with a &s;olemn de&s;ign of fixing a con&s;titution for &s;ucceeding ages. The ju&s;t ends of religious as of civil union are eternally the &s;ame; but the means, by which the&s;e ends may be be&s;t promoted and &s;ecured, will vary with the vici&s;&s;itudes of time and occa&s;ion, will differ according to the local circum&s;tances, the peculiar
<PB N="8" REF="5">
&s;ituation, the improvement, character, or even the preju|dices and pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;everal communities upon who&s;e conduct and edification they are intended to operate.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tolic directions, which are pre&s;erved in the writings of the New Te&s;tament, &s;eem to exclude no eccle|&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution which the experience and more in|&s;tructed judgment of future ages might find it expedient to adopt. And this re&s;erve, if we may &s;o call it, in the legi&s;|lature of the Chri&s;tian church, was wi&s;ely &s;uited to its primitive condition compared with its expected progre&s;s and extent. The circum&s;tances of Chri&s;tianity in the early period of its propagation were nece&s;&s;arily very unlike tho&s;e, which would take place when it became the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of great nations. The rudiments indeed of the future plant were involved within the grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, but &s;till a different treatment was required for its &s;u&s;tentation when the birds of the air lodged among&s;t its branches. A &s;mall &s;elect &s;ociety under the guidance of in&s;pired teachers, without temporal rights and without property, founded in the mid&s;t of enemies and living in &s;ubjection to unbelieving rulers, divided from the re&s;t of the world by many &s;ingularities of conduct and per&s;ua&s;ion, and adver&s;e to the idolatry which public authority every where &s;upported, differed &s;o much from the Chri&s;tian church after Chri&s;tianity prevailed as the religion of the &s;tate; when its oeconomy became gradually interwoven with the civil government of the country; when the purity and propagation of its faith were left to the ordinary expe|dients of human in&s;truction and an authentic &s;cripture; when per&s;ecution and indigence were to be &s;ucceeded by
<PB N="9" REF="6">
legal &s;ecurity and public provi&s;ion&mdash;clande&s;tine and preca|rious opportunities of hearing the word and communicating in the rites of Chri&s;tianity, by &s;tationary pa&s;tors and appro|priated &s;ea&s;ons, as well as places, of religious wor&s;hip and re&s;ort: I &s;ay, the &s;ituation of the Chri&s;tian community was &s;o different in the infant and adult &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity, that the highe&s;t inconvenience would have followed from e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a preci&s;e con&s;titution which was to be obligatory upon both; the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of affairs which was mo&s;t commodious and conducive to edification in the one, be|coming probably impracticable under the circum&s;tances, or altogether inadequate to the wants, of the other.</P>
<P>WHAT farther recommends the forbearance ob&s;ervable in this part of the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, is the con&s;ideration, that as Chri&s;tianity &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion into every country in the world, it cautiou&s;ly refrained from interfering with the municipal regulations or civil condition of any. Negli|gent of every view, but what related to the deliverance of mankind from &s;piritual perdition, the Saviour of the world advanced no preten&s;ions, which by di&s;turbing the arrange|ments of human polity, might pre&s;ent an ob&s;tacle to the reception of his faith. We may a&s;cribe it to this de&s;ign, that he left the laws of his church &s;o open and indeterminate, that whil&s;t the ends of religious communion were &s;ufficiently declared, the form of the &s;ociety might be a&s;&s;imilated to the civil con&s;titution of each country, to which it &s;hould always communicate &s;trength and &s;upport in return for the pro|tection it received. If there be any truth in the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions, they lead to this temperate and charitable conclu&s;ion,
<PB N="10" REF="7">
"that Chri&s;tianity may be profe&s;&s;ed under any form of church government."</P>
<P>BUT though all things are lawful, all things are not ex|pedient&mdash;If we concede to other churches the Chri&s;tian legality of their con&s;titution, &s;o long as Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip and in&s;truction are competently provided for, we may be allowed to maintain the advantage of our own, upon prin|ciples which all parties acknowledge&mdash;con&s;iderations of public utility. We may be allowed to contend, that whil&s;t we imitate, &s;o far as a great di&s;parity of circum&s;tances permits, the example, and what we apprehend to be the order of the apo&s;tolic age, our church and mini&s;try are inferior to none in the great object of their in&s;titution, their &s;uitablene&s;s to promote and uphold the profe&s;&s;ion, knowledge, and influence of pure Chri&s;tianity. The &s;epa|ration of a particular order of men for the work of the mini&s;try&mdash;the re&s;erving to the&s;e, exclu&s;ively, the conduct of public wor&s;hip and the preaching of the word&mdash;the di&s;tribution of the country into di&s;tricts, and the a&s;&s;igning of each di&s;trict to the care and charge of its proper pa&s;tor&mdash;la&s;tly, the appointment to the clergy of a maintenance independent of the caprice of their congregation, are mea|&s;ures of eccle&s;ia&s;tical policy which have been adopted by every national e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity in the world. Concerning the&s;e points there exi&s;ts no controver&s;y. The chief article of regulation, upon which the judgment of &s;ome prote&s;tant churches di&s;&s;ents from ours, is, that whil&s;t they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a perfect parity among&s;t their clergy, we prefer a di&s;tinction of orders in the church, not only as recommended by the u&s;age of the pure&s;t times, but as
<PB N="11" REF="8">
better calculated to promote, what all churches mu&s;t de&s;ire, the credit and efficacy of the &s;acerdotal office.</P>
<P>THE force and truth of this la&s;t con&s;ideration I will endeavour to evince.</P>
<P>FIRST. The body of the clergy, in common with every regular &s;ociety, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contain &s;ome internal provi&s;ion for the government and correction of its members. Where a di&s;tinction of orders is not acknowledged, this government can only be admini&s;tered by &s;ynods and a&s;&s;em|blies, becau&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ition of equality forbids the dele|gation of authority to &s;ingle per&s;ons. Now although it may be requi&s;ite to con&s;ult and collect the opinions of a community, in the momentous deliberations which ought to precede the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e public laws by which it is to be bound; yet in every &s;ociety the execution of the&s;e laws, the current and ordinary affairs of its govern|ment, are better managed by fewer hands. To commit per&s;onal que&s;tions to public debate&mdash;to refer every ca&s;e and character, which requires animadver&s;ion, to the &s;uffrages and examination of a numerous a&s;&s;embly&mdash;what is it, but to feed and to perpetuate contention, to &s;upply materials for endle&s;s altercation, and opportunities for the indulgence of concealed enmity and private prejudices? The complaint of ages te&s;tifies, with how much inflammation, and how little equity, eccle&s;ia&s;tical conventions have conducted their proceedings; how apt intrigue has ever been to pervert enquiry, and clamour to confound di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Whatever may be the other benefits of equality, peace is be&s;t &s;ecured by &s;ubordination. And if this be a con&s;ideration of moment
<PB N="12" REF="9">
in every &s;ociety, it is of peculiar importance to the clergy. Preachers of peace, mini&s;ters of charity and of reconcilia|tion to the world, that con&s;titution &s;urely ill befits their office and character, which has a tendency to engage them in conte&s;ts and di&s;putes with one another.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The appointment of various orders in the church may be con&s;idered as the &s;tationing of mini&s;ters of religion in the various ranks of civil life. The di&s;tinctions of the clergy ought in &s;ome mea&s;ure to corre&s;pond with the di&s;tinctions of lay-&s;ociety, in order to &s;upply each cla&s;s of the people with a clergy of their own level and de&s;cription, with whom they may live and a&s;&s;ociate upon terms of equality. This rea&s;on is not imaginary nor in&s;ignificant. The u&s;efulne&s;s of a virtuous and well-informed clergy con&s;i&s;ts neither wholly nor principally in their public preaching, or the &s;tated functions of their order. It is from the example and in the &s;ociety of &s;uch per&s;ons that the requi&s;ites which prepare the mind for the reception of virtue and knowledge, a ta&s;te for &s;erious reflection and di&s;cour&s;e, habits of thought and rea&s;oning, a veneration for the laws and awful truths of Chri&s;tianity, a di&s;po&s;ition to enquire and a &s;olicitude to learn, are be&s;t gained; at lea&s;t, the decency of deportment, the &s;obriety of manners and conver&s;ation, the learning, the gravity, which u&s;ually accompany the clerical character in&s;en&s;ibly diffu&s;e their in|fluence over every company into which they are admitted. Is it of no importance to provide friends and companions of this character for the &s;uperior as well as for the middle orders of the community? Is it flattery, to &s;ay, that the manners and &s;ociety of higher life would &s;uffer &s;ome depravation,
<PB N="13" REF="10">
from the lo&s;s of &s;o many men of liberal habits and education, as at pre&s;ent, by occupying elevated &s;tations in the church are entitled to be received into its number? This intercour&s;e would cea&s;e, if the clergy were reduced to a level with one another, and of con&s;equence, with the inferior part of the community. The&s;e di&s;tinctions whil&s;t they prevail mu&s;t be complied with. How much &s;o ever the Morali&s;t may de&s;pi&s;e, or the Divine overlook the di&s;|criminations of rank, which the rules or prejudices of modern life have introduced into &s;ociety, when we have the world to in&s;truct and to deal with, we mu&s;t take and treat it as it is, not as the wi&s;hes or the &s;peculations of phi|lo&s;ophy would repre&s;ent it to our view. When we de&s;cribe the public as peculiarly intere&s;ted in every thing which affects, though but remotely, the character of the great and powerful, it is not that the &s;oul of the rich man is more precious than the &s;alvation of the poor, but becau&s;e his virtues and his vices have a more con&s;iderable and exten|&s;ive effect.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. They who behold the privileges and emolu|ments of the &s;uperior clergy with the mo&s;t unfriendly inclina|tion, profe&s;s neverthele&s;s to wi&s;h, that the order it&s;elf &s;hould be re&s;pected&mdash;But how is this re&s;pect to be procured?&mdash;It is equally impo&s;&s;ible, to inve&s;t every clergyman with the decorations of affluence and rank, and to maintain the credit and reputation of an order which is altogether de&s;ti|tute of the&s;e di&s;tinctions. Individuals by the &s;ingularity of their virtue or their talents, may &s;urmount all di&s;advan|tages; but the order will be contemned. At pre&s;ent, every member of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment communicates in
<PB N="14" REF="11">
the dignity which is conferred upon a few&mdash;every clergy|man &s;hares in the re&s;pect which is paid to his &s;uperiors&mdash;the mini&s;try is honoured in the per&s;ons of its prelates. Nor is this oeconomy peculiar to <HI>our</HI> order. The profe&s;&s;ion of arms and of the law derive their lu&s;tre and e&s;teem, not merely from their utility (which is a rea&s;on only to the few) but from the exalted place in the &s;cale of civil life, which hath been wi&s;ely a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e, who fill &s;tations of power and eminence in the&s;e great departments. And if this di&s;po&s;ition of honors be approved in other kinds of public employment, why &s;hould not the credit and liberality of ours be upheld by the &s;ame expedient?</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. Rich and &s;plendid &s;ituations in the church, have been ju&s;tly regarded as prizes, held out to invite per&s;ons of good hopes and ingenuous attainments to enter into its &s;ervice. The value of the pro&s;pect may be the &s;ame, but the allurement is much greater, where opulent &s;hares are re&s;erved to reward the &s;ucce&s;s of a few, than where by a more equal partition of the fund all indeed are competently provided for, but no one can rai&s;e even his hopes beyond a penurious mediocrity of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ituation. It is cer|tainly of con&s;equence that young men of promi&s;ing a bilities be encouraged to engage in the mini&s;try of the church&mdash;otherwi&s;e, our profe&s;&s;ion will be compo&s;ed of the refu&s;e of every other. None will be found content to &s;take the for|tune of their lives in this calling, but they whom &s;low parts, per&s;onal defects, or a depre&s;&s;ed condition of birth and edu|cation preclude from advancement in any other. The voca|tion in time comes to be thought mean and uncreditable&mdash;&s;tudy langui&s;hes&mdash;&s;acred erudition declines&mdash;not only the
<PB N="15" REF="12">
order is di&s;graced, but religion it&s;elf di&s;paraged in &s;uch hands. Some of the mo&s;t judicious and moderate of the pre&s;byterian clergy have been known to lament this defect in their con|&s;titution. They &s;ee and deplore the backwardne&s;s in youth of active and well cultivated faculties, to enter into the church, and their frequent re&s;olutions to quit it. Again, if a gradation of orders be nece&s;&s;ary to invite candidates into the profe&s;&s;ion, it is &s;till more &s;o to excite diligence and emu|lation, to promote an attention to character and public opinion when they are in it; e&s;pecially, to guard again&s;t that &s;loth and negligence, into which men are apt to fall, who are arrived too &s;oon at the limit of their expectations. We will not &s;ay, that the race is always to the &s;wift, or the prize to the de&s;erving, but we have never known that age of the church in which the advantage was not on the &s;ide of learning and decency.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons appear to me to be well founded, and they have this in their favour, that they do not &s;uppo&s;e too much, they &s;uppo&s;e not any impracticable preci&s;ion in the reward of merit, or any greater degree of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, circum&s;pection, and propriety in the be&s;towing of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal preferment than what actually takes place. They are, however, much &s;trengthened, and our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titu|tion defended with yet greater &s;ucce&s;s, when men of con|&s;picuous and acknowledged merit are called to its &s;uperior &s;tations&mdash;"when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth." When pious labours and exemplary virtue, when di&s;tingui&s;hed learning, or eminent utility, when long or arduous &s;ervices are repaid with affluence and dignity, when a life of &s;evere and well-directed application to the
<PB N="16" REF="13">
&s;tudies of religion, when wa&s;ted &s;pirits and declining health are &s;uffered to repo&s;e in honorable lei&s;ure, the good and wi&s;e applaud a con&s;titution, which has provided &s;uch things for &s;uch men.</P>
<P>FINALLY, let us reflect that the&s;e, after all, are but &s;econdary objects. Chri&s;t came not to found an empire upon earth, or to inve&s;t his church with temporal immunities. He came "to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t"&mdash;to purify to him&s;elf from amid&s;t the pollutions of a corrupt world, "a peculiar people, zealous of good works." As far as our e&s;tabli&s;hment conduces to forward and facilitate the&s;e ends, &s;o far we are &s;ure it falls in with his de&s;ign, and is &s;anctified by his authority.&mdash;And whil&s;t they who are en|tru&s;ted with its government employ their cares, and the influence of their &s;tations, in judicious and unremitting en|deavours to enlarge the dominion of virtue and of Chri&s;tianity over the hearts and affections of mankind&mdash;whil&s;t "by purene&s;s, by knowledge," by the aids of learning, by the piety of their example, they labour to inform the con&s;ciences and improve the morals of the people committed to their charge, they &s;ecure to them&s;elves and to the church in which they pre&s;ide, peace and permanency, reverence and &s;upport&mdash;what is infinitely more, they "&s;ave their own &s;ouls"&mdash;they prepare for the approach of that tremendous day, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall return again to the world and to his church, at once the gracious rewarder of the toils, and patience, and fidelity of his &s;ervants, and the &s;trict avenger of abu&s;ed power and neglected duty.</P>
