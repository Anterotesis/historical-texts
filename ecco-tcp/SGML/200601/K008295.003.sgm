<P>MANY words and &s;entences are &s;o frequently heard in the mouths of men, that a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver is inclined to believe, that they mu&s;t contain &s;ome primary principle, &s;ome great rule of action or maxim of prudence, which it is proper al|ways to have pre&s;ent to the attention, and by which the u&s;e of every hour is to be adju&s;ted. Yet, if we con&s;ider the conduct of tho&s;e &s;en|tentious philo&s;ophers, it will often be found, that they repeat the&s;e aphori&s;ms, merely be|cau&s;e they have &s;omewhere heard them, be|cau&s;e they have nothing el&s;e to &s;ay, or be|cau&s;e they conceive that &s;ome veneration is gained by &s;uch appearances of wi&s;dom, but that no ideas are annexed to the words, and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
that, according to the old blunder of the fol|lowers of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> their &s;ouls are mere pipes or organs, which tran&s;mit &s;ounds, but do not under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>OF this kind is that well known and well atte&s;ted po&s;ition, that <HI>life is &s;hort,</HI> which may be heard among mankind by an attentive au|ditor, many times a day, but which never yet within my reach of ob&s;ervation left any im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the mind; and perhaps if my readers will turn their thoughts back upon their old friends, they will find it difficult to call a &s;ingle man to remembrance, who ap|peared to know that life was &s;hort till he was about to lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that <HI>Horace,</HI> in his ac|count of the characters of men, as they are diver&s;ified by the various influence of time, remarks, that the old man is <HI>dilator, &s;pe longus,</HI> given to procra&s;tination, and inclined to ex|tend his hopes to a great di&s;tance. So far are we, generally, from thinking what we often &s;ay of the &s;hortne&s;s of life, that at the time when it is nece&s;&s;arily &s;horte&s;t, we form pro|jects which we delay to execute, indulge &s;uch
<PB N="3" REF="4">
expectations as nothing but a long train of events can gratify, and &s;uffer tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions to gain upon us, which are only excu&s;able in the prime of life.</P>
<P>THESE reflections were lately excited in my mind, by an evening's conver&s;ation with my friend <HI>Pro&s;pero,</HI> who at the age of fifty|five, has bought an e&s;tate, and is now con|triving to di&s;po&s;e and cultivate it with uncom|mon elegance. His great plea&s;ure is to walk among &s;tately trees, and lye mu&s;ing in the heat of noon under their &s;hade; he is there|fore maturely con&s;idering how he &s;hall di&s;po&s;e his walks and his groves, and has at la&s;t deter|mined to &s;end for the be&s;t plans from <HI>Italy,</HI> and forbear planting till the next &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THUS is life trifled away in preparations to do what never can be done, if it be left unattempted till all the requi&s;ites which ima|gination can &s;ugge&s;t are gathered together. Where our de&s;ign terminates only in our own &s;atisfaction, the mi&s;take is of no great im|portance; for the plea&s;ure of expecting en|joyment, is often greater than that of obtain|ing it, and the completion of almo&s;t every
<PB N="4" REF="5">
wi&s;h is found a di&s;appointment; but when many others are intere&s;ted in an undertaking, when any de&s;ign is formed, in which the improvement or &s;ecurity of mankind is in|volved, nothing is more unworthy either of wi&s;dom or benevolence, than to delay it from time to time, or to forget how much every day that pa&s;&s;es over us, take away from our power, and how &s;oon an idle purpo&s;e to do an action, &s;inks into a mournful wi&s;h that it had once been done.</P>
<P>WE are frequently importuned, by the bac|chanalian writers, to lay hold on the pre&s;ent hour, to catch the plea&s;ures which are now within our reach, and remember that futurity is not at our command. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>BUT &s;urely the&s;e exhortations may, with equal propriety, be applied to better purpo&s;es; it may be at lea&s;t inculcated, that plea&s;ures are more &s;afely po&s;tponed than virtues, and that greater lo&s;s is &s;uffered by mi&s;&s;ing an opportu|nity
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of doing good, than an hour of giddy frolick and noi&s;y merriment.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Baxter</HI> had lo&s;t a thou&s;and pounds, which he had laid up for the erection of a &s;chool, he u&s;ed frequently to mention the misfortune, as an incitement to be charitable while God gives the power of be&s;towing, and con&s;idered him&s;elf as culpable in &s;ome degree, for having left a good action in the hands of chance, and &s;uffered his benevolence to be defeated for want of quickne&s;s and diligence.</P>
<P>IT is lamented by <HI>Hearne,</HI> the learned an|tiquary of <HI>Oxford,</HI> that this general forgetful|ne&s;s of the fragility of life, has remarkably infected the &s;tudents of monuments and re|cords; as their employment con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t in collecting and afterwards in arranging, or ab&s;lracting what libraries afford them, they ought to ama&s;s no more than they can dige&s;t; but when they have undertaken a work, they go on &s;earching and tran&s;cribing, call for new &s;upplies, when they are already over-bur|dened, and at la&s;t leave their work un|fini&s;hed. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the bu&s;ine&s;s of a good antiquary, as of a good man, to have mortality always before him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
THUS, not only in the &s;lumber of &s;loth, but in the di&s;&s;ipation of ill directed indu&s;try, is the &s;hortne&s;s of life generally forgotten. As &s;ome men lo&s;e their hours in lazine&s;s, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e, that there is time enough for the reparation of their negligence; others bu&s;y them&s;elves in providing that no length of life may want employment; and it often hap|pens, that &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s and activity are equal|ly &s;urpri&s;ed by the la&s;t &s;ummons, and peri&s;h not more differently from each other, than the fowl that receives the &s;hot in her flight, from her that is killed upon the bu&s;h.</P>
<P>AMONG the many improvements, made by the la&s;t centuries in human knowledge, may be numbered the exact calculations of the value of life; but whatever may be their u&s;e in traffick, they &s;eem very little to have advanced morality. They have hitherto been rather applied to the acqui&s;ition of money, than of wi&s;dom; the computer refers none of his calculations to his own tenure, but per|&s;i&s;ts, in contempt of probability, to foretel long life to him&s;elf, and believes that he is marked out to reach the utmo&s;t verge of hu|man
<PB N="7" REF="8">
exi&s;tence, and &s;ee thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands fall into the grave.</P>
<P>SO deeply is this &s;allacy rooted in the heart, and &s;o &s;trongly guarded by hope and fear again&s;t the approach of rea&s;on, that neither &s;cience nor experience can &s;hake it, and we act as if life were without end, though we &s;ee and confe&s;s its uncertainty and &s;hortne&s;s.</P>
<P>DIVINES have, with great &s;trength and ardour, &s;hewn the ab&s;urdity of delaying refor|mation and repentance; a degree of folly in|deed, which &s;ets eternity to hazard. It is the &s;ame weakne&s;s, in proportion to the impor|tance of the neglect, to transfer any care, which now claims our attention, to a future time: we &s;ometimes &s;ubject our&s;elves to need|le&s;s dangers from accidents which early dili|gence would have obviated, and &s;ometimes perplex our minds by vain precautions, and make provi&s;ion for the execution of de&s;igns, for which the opportunity once mi&s;&s;ed never will return.</P>
<P>AS he that lives longe&s;t lives but a little while, every man may be certain that he has no
<PB N="8" REF="9">
time to wa&s;te. The duties of life are commen|&s;urate to its duration, and every day brings its ta&s;k, which if neglected, is doubled on the morrow. But he that has already trifled away tho&s;e months and years, in which he &s;hould have laboured, mu&s;t remember, that of what he has now only a part, the whole is little; and that &s;ince the few moments remaining are to be con&s;idered as the la&s;t tru&s;t of hea|ven, not one is to be lo&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOSE who exalt them&s;elves into the chair of in&s;truction, and venture upon the pre&s;umptuous office of teaching others, very often without enquiring whether any will &s;ubmit to their authority, have, I think, not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered how much of hu|man life pa&s;&s;es in little incidents, cur&s;ory con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;light bu&s;ine&s;s, and ca&s;ual amu&s;e|ments; and therefore they have endeavour|ed only to exhibit and inculcate the &s;everer, more difficult, and more awful virtues, with|out conde&s;cending to regard tho&s;e petty af|fections, or &s;econdary qualities, which grow important only by their frequency, and which, though they are overlooked by the &s;peculati&s;t becau&s;e they produce no &s;ingle acts of hero|i&s;m, nor a&s;toni&s;h us by great events, yet are every moment exerting their influence upon us, and make the draught of life &s;weet or bitter by imperceptible in&s;tillations. They operate un&s;een and unregarded, as change of air makes us &s;ick or healthy, though we breathe it without attention, and only know the particles that impregnate it by their &s;alu|tary or malignant effects.</P>
<P>YOU have indeed &s;hewn your&s;elf not igno|rant of the value and power of tho&s;e &s;ubaltern endowments, yet you have hitherto forgotten or neglected to recommend good humour to the world, though a little reflection will &s;hew you that it may be properly termed the <HI>balm of being,</HI> the quality to which all that adorns or elevates mankind mu&s;t owe its power of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
plea&s;ing. Without good humour, learning and bravery can to feeble minds be only for|midable: It confers that &s;uperiority which &s;wells the heart of the lion in the de&s;art, where he roars without reply, and ravages without re&s;i&s;tance. Without good humour, virtue may indeed awe by its dignity, and amaze by its brightne&s;s; but mu&s;t always be viewed at a di&s;tance, and will &s;carcely gain a friend or at|tract an imitator.</P>
<P>GOOD humour may be defined a habit of being plea&s;ed, a con&s;tant and perennial &s;oft|ne&s;s of manner, ea&s;ine&s;s of approach, and &s;uavity of di&s;po&s;ition; like that which every man perceives in him&s;elf, when the fir&s;t tran|&s;ports of new felicity have &s;ub&s;ided, and his thoughts are only kept in motion by a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;oft impul&s;es. Good humour is a &s;tate between gayety and unconcern; the act or emanation of a mind at lei&s;ure to re|gard the gratification of another.</P>
<P>IT is imagined by many, that whenever they a&s;pire to plea&s;e, they are required to be merry, to &s;hew the gladne&s;s of their &s;ouls by &s;lights of plea&s;antry, and bur&s;ts of laughter, and to lo&s;e all re&s;erve and reflection in over|flowing
<PB N="11" REF="12">
jollity. But, though the&s;e Men may be courted for a time, and heard with applau&s;e and admiration, they &s;eldom delight us long. We enjoy them a little, and then retire to ea&s;ine&s;s and good humour, as the eye gazes a while on eminences glittering with the &s;un, but &s;oon turns aching away to verdure and to flowers.</P>
<P>GAYETY is to good humour as animal per&s;umes to vegetable fragrance; the one overpowers weak &s;pirits, and the other recre|ates and revives them. Gayety &s;eldom fails to give &s;ome pain; the hearers either &s;train their faculties to accompany its towerings, or are left behind in envy and de&s;pair. Good humour boa&s;ts no faculties which every one does not believe in his own power, and plea&s;es principally by not offending.</P>
<P>IT is well known that the mo&s;t certain way to give any man plea&s;ure, is to per&s;uade him that you receive plea&s;ure from him, to encou|rage him to freedom and confidence, and to avoid any &s;uch appearance of &s;uperiority as may overbear and depre&s;s him. We &s;ee many that by this art only, &s;pend their days in the mid&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="13">
of care&s;&s;es, invitations, and civilities; and with|out any great qualities or extraordinary attain|ments, are the univer&s;al favourites of both &s;exes, and certainly find a friend in every place, becau&s;e they heighten every man's opinion of him&s;elf. The darlings of the world will, in|deed, be generally found &s;uch as excite neither jealou&s;y nor fear, and are not con&s;idered as can|didates for any eminent degree of reputation, but content them&s;elves with common accom|pli&s;hments, and endeavour rather to &s;olicit kindne&s;s than to rai&s;e e&s;teem; therefore in a&s;|&s;emblies and places of re&s;ort it &s;eldom fails to happen, that though at the entrance of &s;ome particular per&s;on every face brightens with glad|ne&s;s, and every hand is extended in &s;alutation, yet if you per&s;ue him beyond the fir&s;t exchange of civilities, you will find him of very &s;mall importance, and only welcome to the com|pany, as one by whom all conceive them|&s;elves admired, and with whom any one is at liberty to amu&s;e him&s;elf when he can find no other auditor or companion, as one with whom all are at ea&s;e, who will hear a je&s;t without critici&s;m, and a narrative without contradiction, who laughs with every wit, and yields to every di&s;puter.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
THERE are many who&s;e vanity always inclines them to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e from whom they have no rea&s;on to fear mortifica|tion; and there are times in which the wi&s;e and the knowing are willing to receive prai&s;e without the labour of de&s;erving it, in which the mo&s;t elevated mind is willing to de&s;cend, and the mo&s;t active to be at re&s;t. All there|fore are at &s;ome hour or another fond of com|panions whom they can entertain upon ea&s;y terms, and who will relieve them from &s;oli|tude, without condemning them to vigilance and caution. We are mo&s;t inclined to love when we have nothing to fear, and he that always indulges us in our pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition, and encourages us to plea&s;e our&s;elves, will not be long without preference in our affec|tion to tho&s;e who&s;e learning holds us at the di&s;tance of pupils, or who&s;e wit calls all at|tention from us, and leaves us without im|portance and without regard,</P>
<P>IT is remarked by prince <HI>Henry,</HI> when he &s;ees <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> lying on the ground, that <HI>he could have better &s;pared a better man.</HI> He was well acquainted with the vices and follies of him whom he lamented, but while his con|viction
<PB N="14" REF="15">
compelled him to do ju&s;tice to &s;uperior qualities, his tenderne&s;s &s;till broke out at the remembrance of <HI>Fal&s;taff,</HI> of the chearful companion, the loud buffoon, with whom he had pa&s;&s;ed his time in all the luxury of idlene&s;s, who had gladded him with unen|vied merriment, and whom he could at once enjoy and de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>YOU may perhaps think this account of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their good humour, not very con&s;i&s;tent with the prai&s;es which I have be&s;towed upon it. But &s;urely nothing can more evidently &s;hew the value of this quality, than that it recommends tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of all other excellencies, and procures regard to the trifling, friend&s;hip to the worthle&s;s, and affection to the dull.</P>
<P>GOOD humour is indeed generally de|graded by the characters in which it is found; for being con&s;idered as a cheap and vulgar quality, we find it often neglected by tho&s;e that having excellencies of higher reputa|tion and brighter &s;plendor, perhaps ima|gine that they have &s;ome right to gratify them&s;elves at the expence of others, and are
<PB N="15" REF="16">
to demand compliance, rather than to prac|ti&s;e it. It is by &s;ome unfortunate mi&s;take that almo&s;t all tho&s;e who have any claim to e&s;teem or love, pre&s;s their preten&s;ions with too little con&s;ideration of others. This mi|&s;take my own intere&s;t as well as my zeal for general happine&s;s makes me de&s;irous to rec|tify, for I have a friend, who, becau&s;e he knows his own fidelity, knowledge, and u&s;efulne&s;s, is never willing to &s;ink into a companion, but is always grave, and &s;olemn, and moro&s;e. I have a wife who&s;e beauty fir&s;t &s;ubdued me, and who&s;e wit af|terwards confirmed her conque&s;t, but who&s;e beauty &s;erves no other purpo&s;e &s;ince our marriage, than to entitle her, in her own opinion, to tyranny, and who&s;e wit is only u&s;ed to ju&s;tify perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>SURELY nothing can be more unrea|&s;onable than to lo&s;e the will to plea&s;e, when we are con&s;cious of the power, or &s;how more tyranny of di&s;po&s;ition, than to chu&s;e any kind of influence before that of kindne&s;s. He that regards the welfare of others, &s;hould endeavour to make his vir|tue
<PB N="16" REF="17">
approachable, that it may be loved and copied; and he that con&s;iders his own hap|pine&s;s, and the wants which every man feels, or will feel of external a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will rather wi&s;h to be &s;urrounded by tho&s;e that love him, than by tho&s;e that admire his excellencies, or &s;ollicit his favours; for ad|miration cea&s;es with novelty, and intere&s;t gains its end and retires. A man who&s;e great qualities want the ornament of &s;uper|ficial attractions, is like a naked moun|tain with mines of gold, which will be frequented only till the trea&s;ure is ex|hau&s;ted.</P>

<P>IF you feel any of that Compa&s;&s;ion, which you recommend to others, you will not di&s;regard a repre&s;entation of a ca&s;e which I have rea&s;on from ob&s;ervation, to believe very common, and which I know by experience to be very mi&s;erable.

I write not merely to vent the &s;welling of my heart, but to en|quire by what means I may recover my tran|quillity, and &s;hall endeavour at brevity in my narrative, having long known that complaint quickly tires, however elegant, or however ju&s;t.</P>

I WAS born in a remote county, of an an|tient family that boa&s;ts of alliances with the greate&s;t names of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, and ex|tends its claims of affinity to the <HI>Tudors</HI> and <HI>Plantagenets.</HI> My ance&s;tors had, by little and little, wa&s;ted their patrimony, till my father had not enough left for the &s;upport o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a family, without de&s;cending to the cultiva|tion of his own grounds, being condemned to pay three &s;i&s;ters the fortunes allotted them by my grandfather, who is &s;u&s;pected to have made his will when he was incapable of ad|ju&s;ting the claims of his children in due pro|portion, and who, perhaps, without de&s;ign, enriched his daughters by beggaring his &s;on. My aunts being at the death of their father, neither young nor beautiful, nor ve|ry eminent for &s;oftne&s;s of behaviour, bene|volence of temper, or extent of knowledge, were &s;uffered, by the neighbours, to live un|&s;olicited, and, by the accumulation of the intere&s;t of their portions, grew every day richer and prouder. My father plea&s;ed him|&s;elf with fore&s;eeing that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e ladies mu&s;t revert at la&s;t to the hereditary e&s;tate, and, that his family might lo&s;e none of its dignity, re&s;olved to keep me untainted

with any profe&s;&s;ion or lucrative employment; whenever therefore I di&s;covered any inclina|tion to the improvement of my condition, my mother never failed to put me in mind of my birth, and charged me to do nothing with which I might be reproached, when I &s;hould come to my aunts e&s;tate.</P>
<P>IN all the perplexities or vexations which want of money brought upon us, it was our con&s;tant practice to have recour&s;e to futurity. If any of our neighbours &s;urpa&s;&s;ed us in ap|pearance, we went home and contrived an equipage, with which the death of my aunts was to &s;upply us. If any pur&s;e-proud up&s;tart was deficient in re&s;pect, vengeance was re|ferred to the time in which our e&s;tate was to be repaired. We regi&s;tered every act of civility and rudene&s;s, enquired the number of di&s;hes at every fea&s;t, and minuted the furni|ture of every hou&s;e, that we might, when the hour of affluence &s;hould come, be able to eclip&s;e all their &s;plendor, and &s;urpa&s;s all their magnificence.</P>
<P>UPON plans of elegance and &s;chemes of plea&s;ure the day ro&s;e and &s;et, and the year

This was all the amu&s;ement of our lei&s;ure, and all the &s;olace of our exigencies; we met toge|ther only to contrive how our approaching fortune &s;hould be enjoyed; for in this our con|ver&s;ation always ended, on whatever &s;ubject it began. We had none of the collateral in|tere&s;ts which diver&s;ify the life of others with joys and hopes, but had turned our whole attention on one event, which we could nei|ther ha&s;ten nor retard, and had no other ob|ject of curio&s;ity, than the health or &s;ickne&s;s of my aunts, of which we were careful to procure very exact and early intelligence.</P>
<P>THIS vi&s;ionary opulence for a while &s;oothed our imagination, but afterwards fired our wi&s;hes, and exa&s;perated our nece&s;&s;ities, and my father could not always re&s;train him|&s;elf from exclaiming, that <HI>no creature had &s;o many lives as a cat and an old maid.</HI> At la&s;t upon the recovery of his &s;i&s;ter from an age, which &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have caught by &s;paring fire, he began to lo&s;e his &s;tomach,

<P>MY mother who loved her hu&s;band, &s;ur|vived him but a little while, and left me the &s;ole heir of their lands, their pro&s;pects, their fchemes, and their wi&s;hes, As I had not en|larged my conceptions either by books or conver&s;ation, I differed only from my father by the fre&s;hne&s;s of my cheeks, and the vigour of my &s;tep; and, like him, gave way to no thoughts but of enjoying the wealth which my aunts were hoarding.</P>
<P>AT length the elde&s;t fell ill. I paid the civilities and compliments which &s;ickne&s;s re|quires with the utmo&s;t punctuality. I dream|ed every night of e&s;cutcheons and white gloves, and enquired every morning at an early hour, whether there were any news of my dear aunt. At la&s;t a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to inform me that I mu&s;t come to her with|out the delay of a moment. I went and heard her la&s;t advice, but opening her will found that &s;he had left her fortune to her &s;econd &s;i&s;ter,</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">
I HUNG my head; the younger &s;i&s;ter threatened to be married, and every thing was di&s;appointment and di&s;content. I was in danger of lo&s;ing irreparably one third of my hopes, and was condemned &s;till to wait for an acce&s;&s;ion to my fortune. Of part of my terror I was &s;oon ea&s;ed; for the youth, whom his relations would have compelled to marry the old lady, after innumerable &s;tipulations, articles, and &s;ettlements, ran away with the daughter of his father's groom; and my aunt, upon this conviction of the perfidy of man, re&s;olved never to li&s;ten more to amorous ad|dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>TEN years longer I dragged the &s;hackles of expectation, without ever &s;uffering a day to pa&s;s, in which I did not compute how much my chance was improved of being rich to-morrow. At la&s;t the &s;econd lady died, af|ter a &s;hort illne&s;s, which yet was long enough to afford her time for the di&s;po&s;al of her e&s;tate, which &s;he gave to me after the death of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I WAS now relieved from part of my mi|&s;ery; a larger fortune, though not in my
<PB N="23" REF="24">
power, was certain and unalienable; nor was there any longer danger, that I might at la&s;t be fru&s;trated of my hopes by a fit of dot|age, the flatteries of a chambermaid, the whi&s;pers of a tale-bearer, or the officiou&s;ne&s;s of a nur&s;e. But my fortune was yet in re|ver&s;ion, my aunt was to be buried before I could emerge to grandeur and to plea&s;ure; and there were yet, according to my father's ob&s;ervation, nine lives between me and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>I HOWEVER lived on, without any cla|mours of di&s;content, and comforted my&s;elf with con&s;idering, that all are mortal, and they who are continually decaying, mu&s;t at la&s;t be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>BUT let no man from this time &s;uffer his felicity to depend on the death of his aunt. The good gentlewoman was very regular in her hours, and &s;imple in her diet, and in walk|ing or &s;itting &s;till, waking or &s;leeping, had always in view the pre&s;ervation of her health. She was not &s;ubject to any di&s;order but hypo|chondriac dejection; by which, without any intention, &s;he encrea&s;ed my mi&s;eries, for
<PB N="24" REF="25">
whenever the weather was cloudy, &s;he would take to her bed and &s;end me notice that her time was come. I went with all the ha&s;te of eagerne&s;s, and &s;ometimes received pa&s;&s;ionate injunctions to be kind to her maid, and direc|tions how the la&s;t offices &s;hould be performed; but if before my arrival the &s;un happened to break out, or the wind to change, I met her at the door, or found her in the garden, bu&s;tling and vigilant, with all the tokens of long life.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES however &s;he fell into di&s;tem|pers, and was thrice given over by the doc|tor, yet &s;he found means of &s;lipping through the gripe of death, and after having tortured me three months at each time with violent alternations of hope and fear, came out of her chamber without any other hurt than the lo&s;s of fle&s;h, which in a few weeks &s;he reco|vered by broths and jellies.</P>
<P>AS mo&s;t have &s;agacity &s;ufficient to gue&s;s at the de&s;ires of an heir, it was the con&s;tant prac|tice of tho&s;e who were hoping at &s;econd hand, and endeavoured to &s;ecure my favour again&s;t the time when I &s;hould be rich, to pay their court, by informing me that my aunt began
<PB N="25" REF="26">
to droop, that &s;he had lately a bad night, that &s;he coughed feebly, and that &s;he could never climb <HI>May</HI> hill; or at lea&s;t, that the autumn would carry her off. Thus was I flattered in the winter with the piercing Winds of <HI>March,</HI> and in &s;ummer, with the Fogs of <HI>September.</HI> But &s;he lived through &s;pring and fall, and &s;et heat and cold at defiance, till after near half a century, I buried her the fourteenth of la&s;t <HI>June,</HI> aged ninety-three years, five months, and &s;ix days.</P>
<P>FOR two months after her death I was rich, and was plea&s;ed with that ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and reverence which wealth in&s;tantaneou&s;ly procures. But this joy is now pa&s;t, and I have returned again to my old habit of wi&s;h|ing. Being accu&s;tomed to give the future full power over my mind, and to &s;tart away from the &s;cene before me to &s;ome expected enjoy|ment, I deliver up my&s;elf to the tyranny of every de&s;ire which fancy &s;ugge&s;ts, and long for a thou&s;and things which I am unable to procure. Money has much le&s;s power, than is a&s;cribed to it by tho&s;e that want it. I had formed &s;chemes which I cannot execute, I had &s;uppo&s;ed events which do not come to pa&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
and the re&s;t of my life mu&s;t pa&s;s in craving &s;olicitude, unle&s;s you can find &s;ome remedy for a mind, corrupted with an inveterate di&s;|ea&s;e of wi&s;hing, and unable to think on any thing but wants, which rea&s;on tells me will never be &s;upplied.</P>

<P>MEN are &s;eldom able to give plea&s;ure, where they are not plea&s;ed them&s;elves; it is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to cultivate an habi|tual alacrity and chearfulne&s;s of mind, for man|kind are chiefly influenced by their affections, and in whatever &s;tate we may be placed by providence, whether we are appointed to con|fer or receive benefits, to implore or to af|ford protection, we can pro&s;ecute our pur|po&s;es with &s;ucce&s;s, only by &s;ecuring the love of tho&s;e with whom we tran&s;act. For though it
<PB N="27" REF="28">
is generally imagined, that he who grants fa|vours, may &s;pare any farther attention to his behaviour, and that u&s;efulne&s;s will procure friends; yet it has been found that there is an art of granting reque&s;ts, an art very difficult of attainment; and that officiou&s;ne&s;s and libera|lity may be &s;o adulterated, as to lo&s;e the greater part of their effect; compliance may provoke, relief may harra&s;s, and liberality di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e of the mind can more fatally di&s;|able it from that intercour&s;e of benevolence, which is one of the chief duties of &s;ocial be|ings, than ill humour or peevi&s;hne&s;s; for tho' it breaks not out in paroxy&s;ms of outrage, nor bur&s;ts into clamour, and turbulence, and blood&s;hed, it yet &s;upplies the deficiency of vi|olence by its frequency, and wears out hap|pine&s;s by &s;low corro&s;ion, and &s;mall injuries in|ce&s;&s;antly repeated. It may be con&s;idered as the canker of life, that de&s;troys its vigour, and checks its improvement, that creeps on with hourly depredations, and taints and vitiates what it cannot con&s;ume.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
PEEVISHNESS, when it has been &s;o far indulged, as to out-run the motions of the will, and di&s;cover it&s;elf without premeditation, is a &s;pecies of depravity in the highe&s;t degree di&s;gu&s;ting and offen&s;ive, becau&s;e no caution or regularity, no rectitude of intention, nor &s;oft|ne&s;s of addre&s;s, can en&s;ure a moment's ex|emption from affront and indignity. While we are courting the favour of a peevi&s;h man, while we are making the warme&s;t offers of &s;ervice, or exerting our&s;elves in the mo&s;t di|ligent civility, an unlucky &s;yllable di&s;plea&s;es, an unheeded circum&s;tance ruffles and exa&s;pe|rates; and in the moment when we congra|tulate our&s;elves upon having gained a friend, we have the mortification of finding all our endeavours fru&s;trated in a moment, and all our a&s;&s;iduity forgotten in the ca&s;ual tumult of &s;ome trifling irritation.</P>
<P>THIS trouble&s;ome impatience is &s;ometimes nothing more than the &s;ymptom of &s;ome deeper malady. He that is angry without daring to confe&s;s his re&s;entment, or &s;orrowful without the liberty of telling his grief, is too fre|quently inclined to give vent to the fermen|tations of his mind at the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages that
<PB N="29" REF="30">
are opened, and to let his pa&s;&s;ions boil over upon tho&s;e whom accident throws in his way. A painful and tedious cour&s;e of &s;ick|ne&s;s frequently produces &s;uch a quick &s;en&s;ibi|lity, &s;uch an alarming apprehen&s;ion of any increa&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, as keeps the &s;oul per|petually on the watch, to prevent or repel any thing from which inconvenience is felt or feared, &s;uch a re&s;tle&s;s and ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitude, as no care, no tenderne&s;s can appea&s;e, and can only be pacified by the cure of the di|&s;temper, and the removal of that pain by which it is excited.</P>
<P>NEARLY approaching to this weakne&s;s, is the captiou&s;ne&s;s of old age: when the &s;trength is cru&s;hed, the &s;en&s;es dulled, and the common plea&s;ures of life become in&s;ipid by repetition, we are willing to impute the unea&s;ine&s;s of our condition to cau&s;es not wholly out of our pow|er, and plea&s;e our&s;elves with fancying that we &s;uffer by neglect, or unkindne&s;s, or want of &s;kill, or any evil which admits a remedy, ra|ther than by the decays of nature which can|not be prevented, delayed, or repaired. We therefore revenge our pains upon tho&s;e on whom we re&s;olve to charge them; and too of|ten
<PB N="30" REF="31">
drive mankind away at the time we have the greate&s;t need of kindne&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT though peevi&s;hne&s;s may &s;ometimes claim our compa&s;&s;ion, as the con&s;equence or concomitant of mi&s;ery, it is very often &s;ound, where nothing can ju&s;tify or excu&s;e its admi&s;|&s;ion. It is often one of the attendants on pro&s;perity, employed by in&s;olence in exacting homage, and by tyranny in harra&s;&s;ing &s;ub|jection. It is frequently the offspring of idle|ne&s;s and pride; of idlene&s;s anxious for trifles; and pride unwilling to endure the lea&s;t ob|&s;truction of her wi&s;hes. Tho&s;e who have long lived in &s;olitude, indeed, naturally con|tract this un&s;ocial quality; becau&s;e, having long had only them&s;elves to plea&s;e, they do not readily depart from their own inclinations; their &s;ingularities therefore are only blameable, when they have imprudently or moro&s;ely with|drawn them&s;elves from the world; but there are others, who have, without any nece&s;&s;ity, nur&s;ed up this habit in their minds, by making implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s, the condition of their favour, and &s;uffering none to approach them, but tho&s;e who watch their eyes, and ob&s;erve
<PB N="31" REF="32">
their nods; who never &s;peak but to applaud, or move but to obey.</P>
<P>HE that gives him&s;elf up to his own fan|cy, and conver&s;es with none but &s;uch as he hires to lull him in the down of ab&s;olute au|thority, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> him with ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and regale him with flattery, &s;oon grows too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">ful for the labour of conte&s;t, too tender for the a&s;perity of contradiction, and too de|licate for the coar&s;ene&s;s of truth. A little oppo&s;ition offends, a little re&s;traint enrages, and a little difficulty perplexes him: for a man, who has been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee every thing give way to his humour and his choice, &s;oon forgets his own littlene&s;s, and expects to find the world rolling at his beck, and all mankind employed to accommodate and de|light him.</P>
<P>TETRICA had a very large fortune be|queathed to her by the &s;ondne&s;s of an aunt, which made her very early independent of her parents, and placed her in a &s;tate of &s;uperi|ority to all about her. She had naturally no &s;uperfluity of under&s;tanding, and therefore was &s;oon intoxicated by the flatteries of her maid,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
who informed her that ladies, &s;uch as &s;he, had nothing to do but take plea&s;ure their own way; that &s;he wanted nothing from others, and had therefore no rea&s;on to value their opinion; that money was every thing; and that they who thought them&s;elves ill-treated, &s;hould look for better u&s;age among their e|quals.</P>
<P>WARM with the&s;e generous &s;entiments, <HI>Tetrica</HI> came forth into the world, in which &s;he endeavoured to di&s;tingui&s;h her&s;elf by an overbearing haughtine&s;s of mien and contemp|tuous vehemence of language; but having neither birth, nor beauty, nor wit in any uncommon degree, the frequent mortifications which &s;he underwent from tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves at liberty to return her in&s;ults, re|duced her turbulence to more cool and &s;ecret malignity, and taught her to con&s;ine her arts of vexation, to tho&s;e whom &s;he might hope to harra&s;s without controul. She conti|nued from her twentieth to her fiftyfifth year to torment all her inferiors with &s;o much di|ligence, that &s;he has contracted a &s;ettled prin|ciple of di&s;approbation, and finds in every
<PB N="33" REF="34">
place &s;omething to grate her mind, and di|&s;turb her quiet.</P>
<P>IF &s;he takes the air, &s;he is always of|fended with the heat or cold, the glare of the &s;un, or the gloom of the clouds; if &s;he makes a vi&s;it, the room in which &s;he is to be received, is too light, or too dark, or furni&s;hed with &s;omething which &s;he cannot &s;ee without aver&s;ion. Her tea is never of the right &s;ort; the figures on the <HI>China</HI> give her di&s;gu&s;t. Where there are children &s;he hates the gabble of brats; where there are none &s;he cannot bear a place without &s;ome chearfulne&s;s and rattle. If many &s;ervants are kept in a hou&s;e, &s;he never fails to tell how lord <HI>Lavi&s;h</HI> was ruined by a numerous reti|nue; if few, &s;he relates the &s;tory of a mi&s;er that made his company wait on them&s;elves. She quarrelled with one family, becau&s;e &s;he had an unplea&s;ant view from their windows; with another, becau&s;e the &s;quirrel leaped with|in two yards of her; and with a third, be|cau&s;e &s;he could not bear the noi&s;e of the par|rot.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
OF milliners and mantua-makers &s;he is the proverbial torment. She compels them to alter their work, then to unmake it, and contrive it after another fa&s;hion, then changes her mind, and likes it better as it was at fir&s;t, then will have a &s;mall improvement. Thus &s;he proceeds till no profit can recom|pen&s;e the vexation; they at la&s;t leave the work at her hou&s;e, and refu&s;e to &s;erve her at any price. Her maid, who is the only being that can endure her tyranny, profe&s;&s;es to take her own cour&s;e, and hear her mi&s;tre&s;s talk. Such is the con&s;equence of peevi&s;hne&s;s; it can be born only when it is de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that too clo&s;e an attention to minute exactne&s;s, or too rigo|rous habits of examining every thing by the &s;tandard of perfection, vitiates the temper, rather than improves the under&s;tanding, and teaches the mind to di&s;cern faults with un|happy penetration. It is incident likewi&s;e to men of vigorous imagination to plea&s;e them|&s;elves too much with &s;uturities, and to fret becau&s;e tho&s;e expectations are di&s;appointed, which ought never to have been formed. Knowledge and genius are often enemies to
<PB N="35" REF="36">
quiet, by &s;ugge&s;ting ideas of excellence, which men and the performances of men cannot at|tain: But let no man ra&s;hly determine, that his unwillingne&s;s to be plea&s;ed, is a proof of under&s;tanding, unle&s;s his &s;uperiority appears from le&s;s doubtful evidence; for though pee|vi&s;hne&s;s may &s;ometimes ju&s;tly boa&s;t its de|&s;cent from learning or from wit, it is much oftener of ba&s;e extraction, the child of vanity, and nur&s;ling of ignorance.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE diligence with which you endea|vour to cultivate the knowledge of na|ture, manners, and life, will perhaps incline you to pay &s;ome regard to the ob&s;ervations of one who has been taught to know man|kind
<PB N="36" REF="37">
by unwelcome information, and who&s;e opinions are the re&s;ult, not of &s;olitary con|jectures, but of practice and experience.</P>
<P>I WAS born to a large fortune, and bred to the knowledge of tho&s;e arts which are &s;up|po&s;ed to accompli&s;h the mind, and adorn the per&s;on of a woman. To the&s;e attainments which cu&s;tom and education almo&s;t forced upon me, I added &s;ome voluntary acqui&s;itions by the u&s;e of books, and the conver&s;ation of that &s;pecies of men whom the ladies ge|nerally mention with horror and aver&s;ion by the name of &s;cholars, but whom I have found, for the mo&s;t part, a harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive order of beings, not &s;o much wi&s;er than our&s;elves, but that they may receive as well as communicate knowledge, and more in|clined to degrade their own character by cowardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than to overbear or op|pre&s;s us with their learning or their wit.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e men, however, if they are by kind treatment encouraged to talk, &s;ome|thing may be gained, which embelli&s;hed with elegance, and &s;oftened by mode&s;ty, will al|ways add dignity and value to female conver|&s;ation;
<PB N="37" REF="38">
and from my acquaintance with the booki&s;h part of the world I derived many principles of judgment and maxims of pru|dence, by which I was enabled to excel all my competitors, and draw upon my&s;elf the general regard in every place of concour&s;e or plea&s;ure. My opinion was the great rule of approbation, my remarks were remembred by tho&s;e who de&s;ired the &s;econd degree of fame, my mien was &s;tudied, my dre&s;s was imitated, my letters were handed from one family to another, and read by tho&s;e who copied them as &s;ent to them&s;elves, my vi&s;its were &s;olici|ted as honours, and multitudes boa&s;ted of an intimacy with <HI>Meli&s;&s;a,</HI> who had only &s;een me by accident, and who&s;e familiarity had never proceeded beyond the exchange of a compliment, or return of a courte&s;y.</P>
<P>I SHALL make no &s;cruple of confe&s;&s;ing that I was plea&s;ed with this univer&s;al venera|tion, becau&s;e I always con&s;idered it as paid to my intrin&s;ic qualities and in&s;eparable me|rit, and very ea&s;ily per&s;waded my&s;elf, that fortune had no part in my &s;uperiority. When I looked upon my gla&s;s I &s;aw youth and beauty, with health that might give me rea|&s;on
<PB N="38" REF="39">
to hope their continuance: when I ex|amined my mind, I found &s;ome &s;trength of judgment, and fertility of fancy; and was told that every action was grace, and that every accent was per&s;wa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN this manner my life pa&s;&s;ed like a con|tinual triumph amid&s;t acclamations, and en|vy, and court&s;hip, and care&s;&s;es: to plea&s;e <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> was the general ambition, and every &s;tratagem of artful flattery was practi&s;ed upon me. To be flattered is grateful, even when we know that our prai&s;es are not believed by tho&s;e who pronounce them; for they prove, at lea&s;t, our general power, and &s;hew that our favour is valued, &s;ince it is purcha|&s;ed by the meanne&s;s of fal&s;hood. But, per|haps, the flatterer is not often detected, for an hone&s;t mind is not apt to &s;u&s;pect, and no one exerts the powers of di&s;cernment with much vigour when &s;elf-love favours the deceit.</P>
<P>THE number of adorers, and the perpe|tual di&s;traction of my thoughts by new &s;chemes of plea&s;ure, prevented me from li&s;tening to any of tho&s;e who croud in multitudes to give
<PB N="39" REF="40">
girls advice, and kept me unmarried and un|engaged to my twenty-&s;eventh year, when, as I was towering in all the pride of unconte&s;t|ed excellency, with a face yet little impaired, and a mind hourly improving, the failure of a fund, in which my money was placed, reduced me to a frugal competency, which allowed little beyond neatne&s;s and indepen|dence.</P>
<P>I BORE the diminution of my riches without any outrages of &s;orrow, or pu&s;ilani|mity of dejection. Indeed I did not know how much I had lo&s;t, for, having always heard and thought more of my wit and beau|ty, than of my fortune, it did not &s;uddenly enter my imagination, that <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> could &s;ink beneath her e&s;tabli&s;hed rank, while her form and her mind continued the &s;ame; that &s;he could cea&s;e to rai&s;e admiration but by cea&s;ing to de&s;erve it, or feel any &s;troke but from the hand of time.</P>
<P>IT was in my power to have concealed the lo&s;s, and to have married, by continu|ing the &s;ame appearance, with all the cre|dit of my original fortune, but I was not
<PB N="40" REF="41">
&s;o far &s;unk in my own e&s;teem, as to &s;ub|mit to the ba&s;ene&s;s of fraud, or to de&s;ire any other recommendation than &s;en&s;e and virtue. I therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my equipage, &s;old tho&s;e ornaments which were become un|&s;uitable to my new condition, and appeared among tho&s;e with whom I u&s;ed to conver&s;e with le&s;s glitter, but with equal &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I FOUND my&s;elf received at every vi&s;it, with an appearance of &s;orrow beyond what is naturally felt for calamities in which we have no part, and was entertained with con|dolence and con&s;olation &s;o long continued, and &s;o frequently repeated, that my friends plainly con&s;ulted, rather their own gratifica|tion, than my relief. Some from that time refu&s;ed my acquaintance, and forebore, with|out any provocation, to repay my vi&s;its; &s;ome vi&s;ited me, but after a longer interval than u&s;ual, and every return was &s;till with more delay; nor did any of my female ac|quaintances fail to introduce the mention of my misfortunes, to compare my pre&s;ent and former condition, to tell me how much it mu&s;t trouble me to want the &s;plendor which I became &s;o well, to look at plea&s;ures, which

<P>MY endle&s;s train of lovers immediately withdrew, without rai&s;ing any emotions. The greater part had indeed always profe&s;&s;ed to court, as it is termed, upon the &s;quare, had
<PB N="42" REF="43">
enquired my fortune, and offered &s;ettlements; and the&s;e had undoubtedly a right to retire without cen&s;ure, &s;ince they had openly treated for money, as nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, and who can tell how little they wanted any other portion? I have always thought the clamours of women unrea&s;onable, who ima|gine them&s;elves injured becau&s;e the men who followed them upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a greater fortune, reject them when they are di&s;covered to have le&s;s. I have never known any lady, who did not think wealth a title to &s;ome &s;tipulations in her favour; and &s;urely what is claimed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of money is ju&s;tly forfeited by its lo&s;s. She that has once demanded a &s;ettlement has allowed the importance of fortune; and when &s;he can|not &s;hew pecuniary merit, why &s;hould &s;he think her cheapener obliged to purcha&s;e?</P>
<P>MY lovers were not all contented with &s;i|lent de&s;ertion. Some of them revenged the neglect which they had formerly endured by wanton and &s;uperfluous in&s;ults, and endea|voured to mortify me by paying in my pre&s;ence tho&s;e civilities to other ladies, which were once devoted only to me. But, as it
<PB N="43" REF="44">
had been my rule to treat men according to the rank of their intellect, I had never &s;uf|fered any one to wa&s;te his life in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, who could have employed it to better pur|po&s;e, and had therefore no enemies but cox|combs, who&s;e re&s;entment and re&s;pect were equally below my con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE only pain which I have felt from degradation, is the lo&s;s of that influence which I had always exerted on the &s;ide of virtue, in the defence of innocence, and the a&s;&s;ertion of truth. I now find my opinions &s;lighted, my &s;entiments critici&s;ed, and my arguments oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e that u&s;ed to li&s;ten to me without reply, and &s;truggle to be fir&s;t in ex|pre&s;&s;ing their conviction. The female di&s;pu|tants have wholly thrown off my authority, and if I endeavour to enforce my rea&s;ons by an appeal to the &s;cholars that happen to be pre&s;ent, the wretches are certain to pay their court by &s;acrificing me and my &s;y&s;tem to a &s;iner gown, and I am every hour in&s;ulted with contradiction by cowards, who could never find till lately that <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> was liable to error.</P>

THERE are two per&s;ons only whom I cannot charge with having changed their con|duct with my change of fortune.

<P>IT is always very ea&s;y for every man, whatever may be his character with others, to find rea&s;ons for e&s;teeming him&s;elf, and therefore cen&s;ure, contempt, or the indubita|ble conviction of crimes, &s;eldom deprive him of his own favour. Tho&s;e, indeed, who can &s;ee only external facts and appearances, may look upon him with abhorrence, but when he calls him&s;elf to his own tribunal, he finds every fault, if not ab&s;olutely effaced by the goodne&s;s of the intention, and the cogen|cy of the motive, yet &s;o much palliated by
<PB N="46" REF="47">
concomittant circum&s;tances, that very little guilt or turpitude remains; and when he takes a &s;ur|vey of the whole complication of his charac|ter, he di&s;covers &s;o many latent excellencies, &s;o many virtues, that want but an opportunity to exert them&s;elves in act, and &s;o many kind wi&s;hes for general happine&s;s, that he cannot but look on him&s;elf as &s;uffering unju&s;tly un|der the infamy of &s;ingle failings, while the general temper of his mind is unknown or unregarded.</P>
<P>IT is natural to mean well, when only ge|neral ideas of virtue are propo&s;ed to the mind, and when no particular pa&s;&s;ion or in|tere&s;t turns us a&s;ide from rectitude; and &s;o willing is every man to flatter him&s;elf, that the difference between approving laws, and obeying them, is frequently forgotten; he that acknowledges the obligations of morality, and plea&s;es his vanity with enforcing them to others, concludes him&s;elf zealous in the cau&s;e of virtue, though he has no longer any regard to her precepts, than they con|form to his own de&s;ires; and counts him&s;elf among her warme&s;t lovers, becau&s;e he prai&s;es her beauty, though every rival &s;teals away his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">
THERE are, however, great numbers who have little recour&s;e to the refinements of &s;pe|culation, but who yet live at peace with them|&s;elves, by means which require le&s;s under|&s;tanding, or le&s;s attention. When they find their hearts burthened with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a crime, in&s;tead of &s;eeking for &s;ome remedy with|in them&s;elves, they look round upon the re&s;t of mankind, to find others tainted with the &s;ame guilt, and oppre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame igno|miny: they plea&s;e them&s;elves with ob&s;erving, that they have numbers on their &s;ide; that they do not bear any peculiar marks of de|pravity; and that though they are hunted out from the &s;ociety of good men, they are not likely to be condemned to &s;olitude.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, perhaps without ex|ception, that none are &s;o indu&s;trious to detect wickedne&s;s, or &s;o ready to impute it, as they who&s;e crimes are apparent and confe&s;&s;ed. They envy the happine&s;s of an unblemi&s;hed reputa|tion, and what they envy they are bu&s;y to de&s;troy: they are unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves meaner, and more corrupt than others, and therefore would willingly pull down from their elevations tho&s;e with whom they cannot
<PB N="48" REF="49">
ri&s;e to an equality. No man yet was wicked without &s;ecret di&s;content, and according to the different degrees of remaining virtue, or unex|tingui&s;hed rea&s;on, he either endeavours to re|form him&s;elf, or corrupt others; either to regain the &s;tation which he has quitted, or prevail on others to imitate his defection.</P>
<P>IT has been always con&s;idered as an alle|viation of mi&s;ery not to &s;uffer alone, even when union and &s;ociety can contribute no|thing to re&s;i&s;tance or e&s;cape; &s;ome comfort of the &s;ame kind &s;eems to incite wickedne&s;s to &s;eek a&s;&s;ociates, though indeed another rea|&s;on may be given, for as guilt is propagated the power of reproach is at lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, and among numbers equally dete&s;table every individual may be &s;heltered from &s;hame, though not from con&s;cience.</P>
<P>ANOTHER lenitive by which the throbs of the brea&s;t are &s;ometimes a&s;&s;uaged, is, the con|templation, not of the &s;ame, but of different crimes. He that cannot ju&s;tify him&s;elf by his re&s;emblance to others, is ready to try &s;ome other expedient, and to enquire what will ri&s;e to his advantage from oppo&s;ition and di&s;&s;imilitude. He ea&s;ily finds &s;ome fault or other in every human
<PB N="49" REF="50">
being, and when he weighs them again&s;t his own, ea&s;ily makes them preponderate while he keeps the balance in his own hand, and throws in or takes out at his plea&s;ure circum|&s;tances that make them heavier or lighter. He then triumphs in his comparative purity, and &s;ets him&s;elf at ea&s;e, not becau&s;e he can refute the charges that are advanced again&s;t him, but becau&s;e he can cen&s;ure his accu&s;ers with equal ju&s;tice, and no longer fears the arrows of re|proach, when he has &s;tored his magazine of malice with weapons equally &s;harp and equal|ly envenomed.</P>
<P>THIS practice, though never rea&s;onable, or ju&s;t, is yet &s;pecious and artful, when the cen&s;ure is directed again&s;t deviations to the contrary extreme. The man who is branded with cowardice, may, with &s;ome appearance of propriety, turn all his force of argument again&s;t a &s;tupid contempt of Life, and ra&s;h precipitation into unnece&s;&s;ary danger. Every rece&s;&s;ion from temerity is an approach towards cowardice, and though it be confe&s;&s;ed that bravery, like other virtues, &s;tands between faults on either hand, yet the place of the middle point may always be di&s;puted; he may therefore often impo&s;e upon carele&s;s
<PB N="50" REF="51">
under&s;tandings, by turning the attention whol|ly from him&s;elf, and keeping it fixed invaria|bly on the oppo&s;ite fault; by &s;hewing how many evils are avoided by his behaviour, he may conceal for a time tho&s;e which are incurred.</P>
<P>BUT vice has not always opportunities or addre&s;s for &s;uch artful &s;ubter&s;uges; and we often find men extenuating their own guilt, only by vague and general charges upon o|thers, or endeavouring to gain re&s;t to them|&s;elves, by pointing &s;ome other prey to the pur&s;uit of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>EVERY whi&s;per of infamy is indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly circulated, every hint of &s;u&s;picion ea|gerly improved, and every failure of con|duct joyfully publi&s;hed, by tho&s;e who&s;e inte|re&s;t it is, that the eye and voice of the pub|lick &s;hould be employed on any rather than on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e artifices, and a thou&s;and others equally vain and equally de&s;picable, are incit|ed by that conviction from which none can &s;et him&s;elf free, by a view of the deformity of wickedne&s;s, and by an ab&s;urd de&s;ire to &s;epa|rate
<PB N="51" REF="52">
the cau&s;e from the effects, and to enjoy the profit of crimes without &s;uffering the &s;hame. Men are willing to try all methods of reconciling guilt and quiet, and when their under&s;tandings are &s;tubborn and uncomplying, rai&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t them, and hope to overpower their own knowledge.</P>
<P>IT is generally not &s;o much the de&s;ire of men, oppre&s;&s;ed with crimes, to deceive the world as them&s;elves, for when no particular circum&s;tances make them dependant on the kindne&s;s or favour of others, infamy will not much di&s;turb them but as it revives their remor&s;e, and is echoed to them from their own hearts. The &s;entence which they mo&s;t dread, is that of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, which they would engage on their &s;ide at any price but the labours of duty, and the &s;orrows of repentance. For this purpo&s;e e|very &s;educement and fallacy is &s;ought, till life is too often at an end while the hopes re&s;t upon &s;ome new experiment, and the la&s;t hour &s;teals on unperceived, while the facul|ties are engaged in counteracting providence, re&s;i&s;ting the voice of rea&s;on, and repre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e of the divine di&s;approbation.</P>

<P>AMONG tho&s;e, who&s;e hopes of ad|vancement, di&s;tinction, or riches, a|ri&s;e from an opinion of their intellectual attainments, it has been, from age to age, an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom to complain of the neglect of learning, of the ingratitude of mankind to their in&s;tructors, and the di&s;cou|ragement which men of genius and &s;tudy &s;uffer from the avarice of the wealthy, the ignorance of the great, the prevalence of fal&s;e ta&s;te, and the encroachment of bar|barity.</P>
<P>MEN are mo&s;t powerfully affected by tho&s;e evils which them&s;elves feel, or which appear before their own eyes; and as there has never been a time of &s;uch general feli|city,
<PB N="53" REF="54">
but that many have mi&s;carried in their hopes, and failed to obtain the rewards to which they had, in their own judgment, a ju&s;t claim, &s;ome offended writer has always declaim'd, in the rage of dliappointment, again&s;t the age, or nation, into which his fate has thrown him; nor is there one who has not fallen upon times more unfavoura|ble to learning than any former century, or who does not wi&s;h, that he had been re&s;erved in the in&s;en&s;ibility of non-exi&s;tence to &s;ome happier hour, when the &s;ons of &s;cience &s;hall regain their antient honours, when literary merit &s;hall no longer be de|&s;pis'd, and all the gifts and care&s;&s;es of man|kind &s;hall recompence the toils of &s;tudy, and add lu&s;tre to the charms of wit.</P>
<P>MANY of the&s;e clamours are undoubte to be con&s;idered only as the bur&s;ts of pride never to be &s;atisfied, as the prattle of affec|tation mimicking di&s;tre&s;&s;es which are not felt, or as the common places of vanity &s;olicitous for &s;plendour of &s;entences and acutene&s;s of remark. Yet it cannot be denied that uni|ver&s;al di&s;content mu&s;t proceed from univer|&s;al hard&s;hips, and though it is evident, that
<PB N="54" REF="55">
not more than one age or people can de&s;erve the cen&s;ure of being more aver&s;e from learn|ing than any other, yet at all times knowledge has encountered impediments, and wit been mortified with contempt, or harra&s;&s;ed with per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary, however, to join im|mediately in the general outcry, or to con|demn mankind as plea&s;ed with ignorance, or always envious of &s;uperior abilities. The mi&s;eries of the learned have been related by them&s;elves, and &s;ince they have not been hitherto found exempted by their knowledge from that partiality with which men gene|rally look upon their own actions and &s;uffer|ings, we may conclude that they have not forgotten to deck their cau&s;e with their brighte&s;t ornaments, and &s;tronge&s;t colours. The logician has doubtle&s;s collected all his &s;ubtilties when they are to be employed in his own defence; and the ma&s;ter of rheto|ric exerted again&s;t his adver&s;ary all the arts by which hatred is embittered. and indigna|tion inflamed.</P>
<P>TO believe no man in his own cau&s;e, is the &s;tanding and perpetual rule of di&s;tribu|tive
<PB N="55" REF="56">
ju&s;tice; and, therefore, &s;ince, in the controver&s;y between the learned and their enemies, we have only the pleas of one party, of the party more able to delude our under&s;tandings by fal&s;e repre&s;entations, and engage our pa&s;&s;ions by plea&s;ing narratives, pathetic lamentations, and &s;oft addre&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t determine our opinion by facts which remain unconte&s;ted, and evidences which are, on each &s;ide allowed to be genuine.</P>
<P>BY this procedure, which mu&s;t be ac|knowledged unexceptionably ju&s;t, I know not whether the learned will find their cau&s;e promoted, or the compa&s;&s;ion which they &s;eem to expect much increa&s;ed: for when their conduct is impartially &s;urveyed, when they are allowed no longer to direct attention at their plea&s;ure, by expatiating on their own de&s;erts, when neither the dignity of know|ledge overawes the judgment, nor the graces of elegance &s;educe it, it will, perhaps, be found, that they have not been able to produce claims to kinder treatment, but have provoked the calamities which they &s;uffered, and &s;eldom wanted friends, but when they wanted virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
THAT few men, celebrated for theore|tic wi&s;dom, live with conformity to their precepts, mu&s;t be readily confe&s;&s;ed; and we cannot wonder that the indignation of mankind ri&s;es with great vehemence again&s;t tho&s;e, who neglect duties which they appear to know, with &s;o &s;trong conviction, the nece&s;&s;ity of performing. Yet &s;ince no man has the power of acting equal to that of thinking, I know not whether the &s;peculati&s;t may not &s;ome|times incur cen&s;ures too &s;evere, and by tho&s;e, who form their ideas of his life from their knowledge of his books, be con&s;idered as wor&s;e than others, only becau&s;e he was ex|pected to be better.</P>
<P>HE, by who&s;e writings the heart is recti|fied, the appetites counteracted, and the pa&s;|&s;ions repre&s;&s;ed, may be con&s;idered as not unprofitable to the great republick of huma|nity, even though his behaviour &s;hould not always exemplify his rules. His in&s;tructions may diffu&s;e their influence to regions, in which it will not be enquired, whether the author be <HI>albus an ater,</HI> good or bad; to times, when all his faults and all his follies &s;hall be lo&s;t in forgetfulne&s;s, among things

of no concern or importance to the world; and he may kindle in thou&s;ands and ten thou|&s;ands that flame which burnt but dimly in him&s;elf, through the fumes of pa&s;&s;ion, or the damps of cowardice. The vicious mo|rali&s;t may be con&s;idered as a taper, by which we are lighted through the labyrinth of com|plicated pa&s;&s;ions, he extends his radiance far|ther than his heat, and guides all that are within view, but burns only tho&s;e who make too near approaches.</P>
<P>YET, &s;ince good or harm mu&s;t be re|ceived, for the mo&s;t part, from tho&s;e to whom we are familiarly known, he who&s;e vices overpower his virtues, in the compa&s;s to which his vices can extend, has &s;urely no rea&s;on to complain that he meets not with affection or veneration, among tho&s;e who are more corrupted by his practice than enlightened by his ideas; that admiration be|gins where acquaintance cea&s;es; and that his favourers are di&s;tant, but his enemies at hand.</P>
<P>BUT many have dared to boa&s;t of neglect|ed merit, and to challenge their age or coun|try
<PB N="58" REF="59">
for cruelty and folly, of whom it can|not be alleged that they have endeavoured to increa&s;e the wi&s;dom or virtue of their readers. They have often been at once profligate in their lives, and licentious in their compo&s;itions; have not only for&s;aken the paths of virtue, but have attempted to lure others after them. They have &s;moothed the road of perdition, covered with flowers the thorns of guilt, and taught temptation &s;weeter notes, &s;ofter blandi&s;hments, and &s;tronger allurements.</P>
<P>IT has been apparently the &s;ettled pur|po&s;e of many writers who&s;e powers, in|du&s;try, and acqui&s;itions, place them high in the ranks of literature, to &s;et fa&s;hion on the &s;ide of wickedne&s;s; to recommend de|bauchery, and lewdne&s;s, by a&s;&s;ociating them with tho&s;e qualities, which are mo&s;t likely to dazzle the di&s;cernment, and attract the affections; and to &s;how innocence and good|ne&s;s with &s;uch attendant weakne&s;&s;es and fol|lies, as nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e them to contempt and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
SUCH men naturally found intimates and companions among the corrupt, the thought|le&s;s, and the intemperate; pa&s;&s;ed their lives amid&s;t the gay levities of &s;portive idlene&s;s, or the warm profe&s;&s;ions of drunken friend|&s;hip; and fed their hopes with the promi|&s;es of wretches, whom them&s;elves had taught to &s;coff at truth. But when fools had laugh|ed away their &s;prightline&s;s, and the lan|guors of exce&s;s could no longer be relieved, they &s;aw their favourers hourly drop away, and wondered and &s;tormed to find them&s;elves abandoned. Whether their companions per|&s;i&s;ted in wickedne&s;s, or returned to virtue, they were equally without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for de|bauchery is &s;elfi&s;h and negligent, and from virtue the virtuous only can expect regard.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid by <HI>Florus</HI> of <HI>Catiline,</HI> who died in the mid&s;t of &s;laughtered enemies, that <HI>his death had been illu&s;trious, had it been &s;uf|fered for his country.</HI> Of the wits, who have langui&s;hed away life under the pre&s;&s;ures of poverty, or in the re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, who have been care&s;&s;ed and rejected, flat|tered and de&s;pi&s;ed, as they were of more or le&s;s u&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;tiled them&s;elves their patrons, it might be ob&s;erved, that

<P>THE wickedne&s;s of a profane or libidi|nous writer is more atrocious and dete&s;table than that of the giddy libertine, or drunken ravi&s;her, not only becau&s;e it extends its ef|fects wider; as a pe&s;tilence that taints the air is more de&s;tructive than poi&s;on infu&s;ed in a draught, but becau&s;e it is committed with cool deliberation. By the in&s;tantane|ous violence of de&s;ire, a good man may &s;ometimes be &s;urpri&s;ed before reflection can come to his re&s;cue; and when the appetites have &s;trengthened their influence by habit they are not ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;ted or &s;uppre&s;s'd; But for the frigid villainy of &s;tudious lewd|ne&s;s, for the calm and mediated malignity of laboured impiety, what plea can be in|vented? What puni&s;hment can be adequate to the crime of him who retires to &s;oli|tudes for the refinement of debauchery, who tortures his fancy, and ran&s;acks his memory, only that he may leave the world le&s;s vir|tuous than he found it, that he may inter|cept the hopes of the ri&s;ing generation, and

<P>CORPORAL &s;en&s;ation is known to depend &s;o much upon novelty, that cu&s;tom takes away from many things their power of giving plea&s;ure or pain. Thus a new dre&s;s becomes ea&s;y by wearing it, and the Palate is reconciled by degrees to di&s;hes which at fir&s;t di&s;gu&s;ted it. That by long ha|bit of carrying a burden we lo&s;e, at lea&s;t in a great part, our &s;en&s;ibility of its weight, any man may be convinced by putting on, for an hour, the armour of our ance&s;tors; for he will &s;carcely believe that men would have had much inclination to marches and battles, en|cumbered
<PB N="63" REF="64">
and oppre&s;&s;ed, as he will find him|&s;elf with the ancient panoply. Yet the heroes that over-run regions, and &s;tormed towns in iron accoutrements, he knows not to have been bigger, and has no rea&s;on to imagine them &s;tronger than the pre&s;ent race of men; he therefore mu&s;t conclude, that their pe|culiar powers were conferred only by pecu|liar habits, and that their familiarity with the dre&s;s of war enabled them to move in it with ea&s;e, vigour and agility.</P>
<P>YET it &s;eems to be the condition of our pre|&s;ent &s;tate, that pain &s;hould be more fixed and permanent than plea&s;ure. Unea&s;ine&s;s gives way by &s;low degrees, and is long before it quits its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;ory; but all our gratifica|tions are volatile, vagrant, and ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipat|ed. The fragrance of the je&s;&s;amine bower is lo&s;t after the enjoyment of a few moments, and the <HI>Indian</HI> wanders among his native odours without any &s;en&s;e of their exhalations. It is, indeed, not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew by many in&s;tances what every change of place is &s;uffi|cient to prove, and what all mankind confe&s;s, by an ince&s;&s;ant call for variety, and a re&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="64" REF="65">
pur&s;uit of enjoyments, which they value only becau&s;e unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>SOMETHING &s;imilar, or analogous, may be ob&s;erved in tho&s;e effects which are pro|duced immediately upon the mind; nothing can &s;trongly &s;trike or affect us, but what is rare or &s;udden; the mo&s;t important events, when they become familiar, are no longer con&s;idered with wonder or &s;olicitude, and that which at fir&s;t filled up our whole attention, and left no place for any other thought, is &s;oon thru&s;t a&s;ide into &s;ome remote repo&s;itory of the Mind, and lies among other lumber of the memory, over-looked and neglected.</P>
<P>THE manner in which external force acts upon the body is very little &s;ubject to the re|gulation of the will; no man can at plea&s;ure obtund, or invigorate his &s;en&s;es, prolong the agency of any impul&s;e, or continue the pre|&s;ence of any image traced upon the eye, or any &s;ound infu&s;ed into the ear. But our ideas are more &s;ubjected to choice, we can call them before us, and command their &s;tay, we can facilitate and promote their recurrence, we can either repre&s;s their intru&s;ion, or
<PB N="65" REF="66">
ha&s;ten their retreat. It is therefore the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of wi&s;dom and virtue, to &s;elect among the numberle&s;s objects which are every mo|ment &s;triving for our notice, &s;uch as may afford u&s;eful employment to the mind, by en|abling us to exalt our rea&s;on, extend our views, and &s;ecure our happine&s;s. But this choice is to be made with very little regard to rarene&s;s or frequency; for nothing is valuable merely becau&s;e it is either rare or common, but becau&s;e it is adapted to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e, and enables us to &s;upply &s;ome deficiency of our nature.</P>
<P>MILTON has very judiciou&s;ly repre&s;ented the father of mankind &s;eized with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight of death, exhibited to him on the mount of vi&s;ion. For &s;urely, nothing can &s;o much di&s;turb the pa&s;&s;ions, or perplex the intellects of man, as the di&s;ruption of his union with vi&s;ible nature; a &s;eparation from all that has hitherto delighted or engaged him; a change, not only of the place, but the manner of his being; an entrance into a &s;late, not &s;imply which he knows not, but which perhaps he has not faculties to know; an immediate and perceptible communication
<PB N="66" REF="67">
with the &s;upreme being, and, what is above all di&s;tre&s;sful and alarming, the final &s;en|tence, and unalterable allotment.</P>
<P>YET we to whom the &s;hortne&s;s of life has given frequent occa&s;ions of contemplat|ing mortality, can, without emotion, &s;ee generations of men pa&s;s away, and are at lei&s;ure to e&s;tabli&s;h modes of &s;orrow, and adju&s;t the ceremonial of death. We can look upon funereal pomp as a common &s;pec|tacle in which we have no concern, and turn away from it to trifles and amu&s;ements, without dejection of look, or inquietude of heart.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, apparent from the con&s;ti|tution of the world, that there mu&s;t be a time for other thoughts; and a perpetual me|ditation upon the la&s;t hour, however it may become the &s;olitude of a mona&s;tery, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with many duties of common life. But &s;urely the remembrance of death ought to predominate in our minds, as an habi|tual and &s;ettled principle, always operating, though not always perceived; and our at|tention &s;hould &s;eldom wander &s;o far from
<PB N="67" REF="68">
our own condition, as not to be recalled and fixed by &s;ight of an event, which mu&s;t &s;oon, we know not how &s;oon, happen likewi&s;e to our&s;elves, and of which, tho' we cannot appoint the time, we may &s;ecure the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>YET, though every in&s;tance of death may ju&s;tly awaken our fears, and quicken our vigilance, it &s;eldom happens that we are much alarmed, unle&s;s &s;ome clo&s;e connexion is broken, &s;ome &s;cheme fru&s;trated, or &s;ome hope defeated. Many therefore &s;eem to pa&s;s on from youth to decrepitude without any reflection on the end of life, becau&s;e they are wholly involved within them&s;elves, and look on others only as inhabitants of the common earth, without any expectation of receiving good, or intention of be&s;tow|ing it.</P>
<P>IT is indeed impo&s;&s;ible, without &s;ome mor|tification of that de&s;ire which every man feels of being remembered and lamented, to remark how little concern is cau&s;ed by the eternal de|parture even of tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed their lives with publick honours, and been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by &s;uperior qualities, or extraordinary
<PB N="68" REF="69">
performances. It is not po&s;&s;ible to be regard|ed with tenderne&s;s except by a few. That merit which gives greatne&s;s and renown, dif|fu&s;es its influence to a wide compa&s;s, but acts weakly on every &s;ingle brea&s;t; it is placed at a di&s;tance from common &s;pectators, and &s;hines like one of the remote &s;tars, of which the light reaches us, but not the heat. The wit, the hero, the philo&s;opher, whom either their tempers or their fortunes have hindered from intimate relations and tender intercour&s;es, die often without any other effect than that of adding a new Topic to the conver&s;ation of the day. They impre&s;s none with any fre&s;h conviction of the fragility of our nature, be|cau&s;e none had any particular intere&s;t in their lives, or was united to them by a reciprocation of benefits and endearments.</P>
<P>THUS we find it often happens, that tho&s;e who in their lives have excited applau&s;e and admiration, are laid at la&s;t in the ground with|out the common honour of a &s;tone; becau&s;e by tho&s;e excellencies with which many have been delighted, none have been obliged, and, though they had many to celebrate, they had none to love them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
CUSTOM &s;o far regulates the &s;entiments at lea&s;t of common minds, that I believe men may be generally ob&s;erved to grow le&s;s tender as they advance in age. He, who, when life was new, melted at the lo&s;s of every compa|nion, can look in time without concern, upon the grave into which his la&s;t friend was thrown, and into which him&s;elf is ready to fall; not that he is more willing to die than formerly, but that he is more familiar to the death of o|thers, and therefore is not alarmed &s;o far as to con&s;ider how much nearer he approaches to his end. But this is to &s;ubmit tamely to the tyranny of accident, and to &s;uffer our rea&s;on to lie u&s;ele&s;s. Every funeral may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a &s;ummons to prepare for that &s;tate, into which it &s;hews us that we mu&s;t &s;ometime enter; and the &s;ummons is more loud and piercing, as the event of which it warns us is at le&s;s di&s;tance. To neglect at any time preparation for death, is to &s;leep on our po&s;t at a &s;iege, but to omit it in old age, is to &s;leep at an attack.</P>
<P>IT has always appeared to me one of the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages in the vi&s;ions of <HI>Quevedo,</HI> which &s;tigmati&s;es tho&s;e as fools who complain
<PB N="70" REF="71">
that they failed of happine&s;s by &s;udden death. "How, &s;ays he, can death be &s;udden to a be|ing who always knew that he mu&s;t die, and that the time of his death was uncertain?"</P>
<P>SINCE bu&s;ine&s;s and gaiety are always drawing our attention away from a future &s;tate, &s;ome admonition is frequently nece&s;&s;ary to recall it to our minds, and what can more properly renew the impre&s;&s;ion than the exam|ples of mortality which every day &s;upplies? The great incentive to virtue is the reflection that we mu&s;t die, it will therefore be u&s;eful to accu&s;tom our&s;elves, whenever we &s;ee a fu|neral, to con&s;ider how &s;oon we may be add|ed to the number of tho&s;e who&s;e probation is pa&s;t, and who&s;e happine&s;s or mi&s;ery &s;hall en|dure for ever.</P>

<P>SUSPICION, however nece&s;&s;ary it may be to our &s;afe pa&s;&s;age through ways be&s;et on all &s;ides by fraud and malice, has been always con&s;idered, when it exceeds the common mea&s;ures of prudent caution, as a token of depravity and corruption; and an old <HI>Greek</HI> writer of &s;ententious precepts has laid down as a &s;tanding maxim, that <HI>he who believes not another on his oath, knows him&s;elf to be perjured.</HI></P>
<P>WE can form our opinions of that which we know not, only by placing it in com|pari&s;on with &s;omething that we know: whoever therefore is over-run with &s;u&s;picion, and detects artifice and &s;tratagem in every propo&s;al, mu&s;t either have learned by expe|rience the wickedne&s;s of mankind, and been taught to avoid fraud by having often been deceived; or he mu&s;t derive his judgment
<PB N="72" REF="73">
from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own di&s;po&s;ition, and impute to others the &s;ame inclinations which he feels predominant in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>TO learn caution by turning our eyes upon life, and ob&s;erving the arts by which negligence is &s;urpri&s;ed, timidity overborn, and credulity amu&s;ed, requires either great latitude of conver&s;e and long acquaintance with bu&s;ine&s;s, or uncommon activity of vigilance, and acutene&s;s of penetration. When therefore a young man, not di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by &s;uperior vigour of intellect, comes into the world full of &s;cruples apd diffidence; makes a bargain with many provi&s;ional li|mitations; he&s;itates in his an&s;wer to a com|mon que&s;tion, le&s;t more &s;hould be intended than he can immediately di&s;cover; has a long reach in detecting the projects of his acquaintance; con&s;iders every care&s;s as an act of hypocri&s;y, and feels neither gratitude nor affection from the tenderne&s;s of his friends, becau&s;e he believes no one to have any real tenderne&s;s but for him&s;elf; what|ever expectations this early &s;agacity may rai&s;e of his future eminence or riches, I can &s;eldom forbear to con&s;ider him as a wretch incapable of genero&s;ity or bene|volence,
<PB N="73" REF="74">
as a villain early completed beyond the need of common opportunities and gra|dual temptations.</P>
<P>UPON men of this cla&s;s in&s;truction and admonition are generally thrown away, be|cau&s;e they con&s;ider artifice and deceit as proofs of under&s;tanding; they are mi&s;led at the &s;ame time by the two great &s;educers of the world, vanity and intere&s;t, and not only look upon tho&s;e, who act with openne&s;s and confidence, as condemned by their princi|ples to ob&s;curity and want, but as con|temptible for narrowne&s;s of comprehen&s;ion, &s;hortne&s;s of views, and &s;lowne&s;s of con|trivance.</P>
<P>THE world has been long amu&s;ed with the mention of policy in publick tran&s;actions, and of art in private affairs; they have been con&s;idered as the effects of great qualities, and as unattainable by men of the com|mon level: yet I have not found many performances either of art, or policy, that required &s;uch &s;tupendous efforts of intellect,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
or might not have been effected by fal&s;hood and impudence, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other powers. To profe&s;s what he does not mean, to promi&s;e what he cannot per|form, to flatter ambition with pro&s;pects of promotion, and mi&s;ery with hopes of relief, to &s;ooth pride with appearances of &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, and appea&s;e enmity by blandi&s;hments and bribes, can &s;urely imply nothing more or greater than a mind devoted wholly to its own purpo&s;es, a face that cannot blu&s;h, and a heart that cannot feel.</P>
<P>THESE practices are &s;o mean and ba&s;e, that he who finds in him&s;elf no tendency to u&s;e them, cannot ea&s;ily believe that they are con&s;idered by others with le&s;s dete&s;ta|tion; he therefore &s;uffers him&s;elf to &s;lumber in fal&s;e &s;ecurity, and becomes a prey to tho&s;e who applaud their own &s;ubtilty be|cau&s;e they know how to &s;teal upon his &s;leep, and exult in the &s;ucce&s;s which they could never have obtained had they not at|tempted a man better than them&s;elves, who
<PB N="75" REF="76">
was hindered from obviating their &s;tratagems, not by folly, but by innocence.</P>
<P>SUSPICION is, indeed, a temper &s;o un|ea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, that it is very ju&s;tly ap|pointed the concomitant of guilt. It is &s;aid, that no torture is equal to the inhibition of &s;leep long continued; a pain, to which the &s;tate of that man bears a very exact analogy, who dares never give re&s;t to his vigilance and circum&s;pection, but con&s;iders him&s;elf as &s;ur|rounded by &s;ecret foes, and fears to entru&s;t his children, or his friend, the &s;ecret that throbs in his brea&s;t, and the anxieties that break into his face. To avoid, at this ex|pence, tho&s;e evils to which ea&s;ine&s;s and friend|&s;hip might have expo&s;ed him, is &s;urely to buy &s;afety at too dear a rate, to die le&s;t he &s;hould be killed, and, in the language of the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;atiri&s;t, to &s;ave life by lo&s;ing all for which a wi&s;e man would live.</P>
<P>IN the diet of the <HI>German</HI> empire, as we are told by <HI>Camerarius,</HI> the princes were once di&s;playing their riches and felicity, and each boa&s;ting the particular advantages of his own
<PB N="76" REF="77">
dominions. One of them who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a country not remarkable for the grandeur of its cities, or the fertility of its &s;oil, ro&s;e in his turn to &s;peak: the re&s;t li&s;tened between pity and contempt, till he declared, in honour of his territories, that he could travel through them without a guard, and if he was weary, &s;leep in &s;afety upon the lap of the fir&s;t man whom he &s;hould meet; a commendation which would have been ill exchanged for the boa&s;t of palaces, pa&s;tures, or &s;treams.</P>
<P>SUSPICION is not le&s;s an enemy to virtue than to happine&s;s: he that is already corrupt is naturally &s;u&s;picious, and he that becomes &s;u&s;picious will quickly be corrupt. It is too common for men to learn the frauds by which them&s;elves have &s;uffered, and when they are once per&s;uaded that deceit will be employed again&s;t them, they &s;ometimes think the &s;ame arts ju&s;tified by the nece&s;&s;ity of defence. Even they who&s;e virtue is too well e&s;tabli&s;hed to give way to example, or be &s;haken by &s;ophi|&s;try, mu&s;t yet find their love of mankind di|mini&s;hed with their e&s;teem, and will grow le&s;s zealous for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of
<PB N="77" REF="78">
tho&s;e by whom they &s;u&s;pect their own &s;afety or happine&s;s endangered.</P>
<P>THUS we find old age, upon which &s;u&s;|picion has for the mo&s;t part been &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed by long intercour&s;e with the world, inflexible and &s;evere, not ea&s;ily &s;oftened by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, melted by complaint, or &s;ubdued by &s;upplication. Frequent experience of counterfeited mi&s;eries, and di&s;&s;embled virtue, have in time overcome that di&s;po&s;ition to ten|derne&s;s and &s;ympathy, which is &s;o powerful in our younger years, and they that happen to petition late for compa&s;&s;ion or a&s;&s;i&s;tance are doomed to langui&s;h without regard, and &s;uffer for the crimes of men who have formerly been found unde&s;erving or ungrateful.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS are certainly chargeable with the depravation of mankind, when they relate without cen&s;ure tho&s;e &s;tratagems of war by which the virtues of an enemy are engaged to his de&s;truction. A &s;hip comes be|fore a port, weather-beaten and &s;hattered, and the crew implore the liberty of repairing
<PB N="78" REF="79">
their breaches, &s;upplying them&s;elves with ne|ce&s;&s;aries, or burying their dead. The huma|nity of the inhabitants inclines them to con|&s;ent, the &s;trangers enter the town with weapons concealed, fall &s;uddenly upon their benefactors, de&s;troy tho&s;e that make re&s;i&s;tance, and become ma&s;ters of the place; they return home rich with plunder, and their &s;ucce&s;s is recorded to encourage imitation.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely war has its laws, and ought to be conducted with &s;ome regard to the uni|ver&s;al intere&s;t of Man. Tho&s;e may ju&s;tly be pur&s;ued as enemies to the general community of the world, who &s;uffer ho&s;tility to vacate the eternal and unalterable laws of right, and pur&s;ue their private advantages by means, which, if once e&s;tabli&s;hed and allowed, mu&s;t de&s;troy all benevolence, cut off from every man all hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from another, and fill the world with implacable ho&s;tility. What|ever is thus gained ought to be re&s;tored, and tho&s;e who have conquered by &s;uch treachery may be ju&s;tly denied the protection of their native country.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
WHOEVER commits a fraud is guilty not only of the particular injury to him whom he deceives, but of the diminution of that confidence which con&s;titutes not only the ea&s;e but the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. He that &s;uffers by impo&s;ture has too often his virtue more impaired than his fortune; but as it is nece&s;&s;ary not to invite robbery by &s;upinene&s;s, &s;o it is our duty not to &s;uppre&s;s ten|derne&s;s by &s;u&s;picion; it is better to &s;uffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be &s;ometimes cheated than not to tru&s;t.</P>

<P>AS providence has made the human &s;oul an active being, always impatient for novelty, and &s;truggling for &s;omething yet un|enjoyed with re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire and unwearied progre&s;&s;ion, the world &s;eems to have been eminently adapted to this di&s;po&s;ition of the mind: it is formed to rai&s;e new expectations by con&s;tant vici&s;&s;itudes, and to obviate &s;atie|ty by perpetual change.</P>
<P>WHEREVER we turn our eyes, we find &s;omething to revive our curio&s;ity, and engage our attention. In the du&s;k of the morning we watch the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, and &s;ee the day diver&s;ify the clouds, and open new pro|&s;pects in its gradual advance. After a few hours, we &s;ee the &s;hades lengthen, and the light decline, till the &s;ky is re&s;igned to a mul|titude

<P>THE poets have numbered among the fe|licities of the golden age, an exemption from the change of &s;ea&s;ons, and a perpetuity of &s;pring; but I am not certain that in this &s;tate of imaginary happine&s;s they have made &s;ufficient provi&s;ion for that in&s;atiable demand of new gratifications, which &s;eems particular|ly to characterize the nature of man. Our &s;en&s;e of delight is in a great mea&s;ure compa|rative, and ari&s;es at once from the &s;en&s;ations which we feel, and tho&s;e which we remember: Thus ea&s;e after torment is plea&s;ure for a time, and we are very agreeably recreated, when the body, chilled with the weather, is gradual|ly recovering its natural tepidity; but the joy cea&s;es when we have forgot the cold, we mu&s;t fall below ea&s;e again, if we de&s;ire to ri&s;e above it, and purcha&s;e new &s;elicity by vo|luntary

pain. It is therefore not unlikely that however the fancy may be amu&s;ed with the de&s;cription of regions in which no wind is heard but the gentle zephir, and no &s;cenes are di&s;played, but vallies enamelled with unfading flowers, and woods waving their perennial verdure, we &s;hould &s;oon grow weary of uni|formity, find our thoughts langui&s;h for want of other objects and employment, call on hea|ven for our wonted round of &s;ea&s;on, and think our&s;elves liberally recompen&s;ed for the inconveniencies of &s;ummer and winter, by new perceptions of the calmne&s;s and mildne&s;s of the intermediate variations.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;ea&s;on has its particular power of &s;triking the mind. The nakedne&s;s and a&s;pe|rity of the wintry world always fills the be|holder with pen&s;ive and profound a&s;toni&s;h|ment; as the variety of the &s;cene is le&s;&s;ened, its grandeur is increa&s;ed; and the mind is &s;welled at once by the mingled ideas of the pre&s;ent and the pa&s;t, of the beauties which have vani&s;hed from the eyes, and the wa&s;te and de&s;olation that are now before them.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">
IT is ob&s;erved by <HI>Milton,</HI> that he who neg|lects to vi&s;it the country in &s;pring, and rejects the plea&s;ures that are then in their fir&s;t bloom and fragrance, is guilty of <HI>&s;ullenne&s;s again&s;t na|ture.</HI> If we allot different duties to different &s;ea&s;ons, he may be charged with equal di&s;obe|dience to the voice of nature, who looks on the bleak hills and leafle&s;s woods, without &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s and awe. Spring is the &s;ea&s;on of gaie|ty, and winter of terror; in &s;pring the heart of tranquillity dances to the melody of the groves, and the eye of benevolence &s;parkles at the &s;ight of happine&s;s and plenty: In the win|ter, compa&s;&s;ion melts at univer&s;al calamity, and the tear of &s;oftne&s;s &s;tarts at the wailings of hunger, and the cries of the creation in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed in mo&s;t minds very lit|tle inclination to indulge heavine&s;s and &s;orrow, nor do I recommend them beyond the degree nece&s;&s;ary to maintain in its full vigour that habitual &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s, which, in a world of &s;o much mi&s;ery, is nece&s;&s;ary to the ready di&s;charge of our mo&s;t important du|ties. The winter therefore is generally cele|brated
<PB N="84" REF="85">
as the proper &s;ea&s;on for dome&s;tick mer|riment and gaiety. We are &s;eldom invited by the votaries of plea&s;ure to look abroad for any other purpo&s;e, than that we may &s;hrink back with more &s;atisfaction to our coverts, and when we have heard the howl of the tempe&s;t, and felt the gripe of the fro&s;t, con|gratulate each other with more gladne&s;s upon a clo&s;e room, an ea&s;y chair, a high piled fire, and a &s;moaking dinner.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed now natural incite|ments to jollity and conver&s;ation. Differ|ences, we know, are never &s;o effectually laid a&s;leep, as by &s;ome common calamity; an enemy unites all to whom he threatens dan|ger. The rigour of winter brings generally to the &s;ame fire-&s;ide tho&s;e, who, by the op|po&s;ition of their inclinations, or the diffe|rence of their employments, moved in various directions through the other parts of the year; and when they have met, and find it their mu|tual intere&s;t to remain together, they endear each other by mutual compliances, and often wi&s;h for the continuance of the &s;ocial &s;ea&s;on with all its bleakne&s;s and all its &s;everities.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
TO the men of &s;tudy and imagination the winter is generally the chief time of labour. Gloom and &s;ilence produce compo&s;ure of mind, and concentration of ideas; and the privation of external plea&s;ure naturally cau&s;es an effort to find entertainment within. This is the time in which tho&s;e, whom literature enables to find amu&s;ements for them&s;elves, have more than common con|victions of their own happine&s;s, When they are condemned by the elements to retirement, and debarred from mo&s;t of the diver&s;ions which are called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t the flight of time, they can always find new &s;ubjects of enquiry, engage their pa&s;&s;ions in new pur&s;uits, and pre|&s;erve them&s;elves from that wearine&s;s which hangs always flagging upon the vacant mind.</P>
<P>IT cannot indeed be expected of all to be poets and philo&s;ophers, deeply ver&s;ed in &s;ci|ences, or much engaged in re&s;earches in|to pa&s;t or di&s;tant tran&s;actions; it is nece&s;&s;ary that the greater part of mankind &s;hould be employed in the trivial bu&s;ine&s;s of common life; trivial, indeed, not with re&s;pect to its influence upon our happine&s;s, but of the abi|lities
<PB N="86" REF="87">
requi&s;ite to conduct it. The&s;e mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be more dependent on accident for the means of &s;pending agreeably tho&s;e hours which their occupations leave unengaged, or which the imbecillity of nature obliges them to allow to relaxation and diver&s;ion. Yet even on the&s;e I would willingly impre&s;s &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the value of time, as may incline them to find out for their mo&s;t carele&s;s hours &s;ome amu&s;ement of more u&s;e and dignity than the common games, which not only weary the mind without im|proving it, but &s;trengthen the pa&s;&s;ions of en|vy and avarice, and often lead to fraud and to profu&s;ion, to corruption and to ruin. It is unworthy of a rea&s;onble being to &s;pend any of the little time allotted us, without &s;ome tendency, either direct or oblique, to the end of our exi&s;tence. And though every moment cannot be laid out on the formal and regular improvement of our knowledge, or in the &s;ta|ted practice of a moral or religious duty, yet none &s;hould be &s;o &s;pent as to exclude wi&s;dom or virtue, or pa&s;s without po&s;&s;ibility of quali|fying us more or le&s;s for the better employ|ment of tho&s;e which are to come.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
IT is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s an hour in ho|ne&s;t conver&s;ation, without being able when we ri&s;e from it, to plea&s;e our&s;elves with hav|ing given or received &s;ome advantages; but a man may &s;huffle cards, or rattle dice, from noon to midnight, without tracing any new idea in his mind, or being able to recollect the day by any other token than his gain or lo&s;s, and a confu&s;ed remembrance of agitated pa&s;&s;ions, and clamorous altercations.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as experience is always of more weight than precept, any of my readers, who are contriving how to &s;pend the dreary months before them, may con&s;ider which of their pa&s;t amu&s;ements fill them now with greate&s;t &s;atisfaction, and re&s;olve to repeat tho&s;e gratifications of which the plea&s;ure is mo&s;t durable.</P>

<P>AMONG que&s;tions which have been long di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the world, without any approach to deci&s;ion, may be numbered the precedency or &s;uperior exeellence of one virtue to another, which has long furni&s;hed a &s;ubject of debate to men who&s;e lei&s;ure &s;ent them out into the intellectual world in &s;earch of employment, and who have, perhaps, been &s;ometimes with-held from attending to the practice of their favourite duty, by their zeal for its advancement, and diligence in its celebration.</P>
<P>THE intricacy of this di&s;pute may be al|ledged as a proof of that tenderne&s;s for man|kind which providence has, I think, univer|&s;ally di&s;played, by making attainments ea&s;y in proportion as they are nece&s;ary. That all the duties of morality ought to be practi&s;ed, is without difficulty di&s;coverable, becau&s;e igno|rance or uncertainty would immediately in|volve the world in confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s; but
<PB N="89" REF="90">
which duty ought to be mo&s;t e&s;teemed or prai&s;ed, we may continue to debate, without much inconvenience, &s;o all be diligently per|formed as there is opportunity or need: for upon practice, not upon opinion, depends the happine&s;s of mankind; and controver|&s;ies, merely &s;peculative, are of &s;mall impor|tance in them&s;elves, however they may have &s;ometimes heated a di&s;putant, or provoked a faction.</P>
<P>OF the divine author of our religion it is impo&s;&s;ible to peru&s;e the evangelical hi&s;to|ries, without ob&s;erving how little he fa|voured the vanity of inqui&s;itivene&s;s; how much more rarely he conde&s;cended to &s;atisfy curio&s;ity, than to relieve di&s;tre&s;s; and how much he de&s;ired that his followers &s;hould ra|ther excel in goodne&s;s than in knowledge. His precepts tend immediately to the rectifica|tion of the moral principles, and the direction of daily conduct, without o&s;tentation, with|out art, at once irrefragable and plain, &s;uch as well-meaning &s;implicity may readily con|ceive, and of which we cannot mi&s;take the meaning, but when we are afraid to find it.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
THE mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice pre&s;cribed to us, in our tran&s;actions with others, is remarka|bly clear and comprehen&s;ive: <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, even &s;o do unto them.</HI> A law by which every claim of right may be immediately adju&s;ted, as far as the private con&s;cience requires to be inform|ed; a law, of which every man may find the expo&s;ition in his own brea&s;t, and which may always be ob&s;erved without any other qualifi|cations than hone&s;ty of intention, and purity of will.</P>
<P>OVER this Law, indeed, &s;ome &s;ons of &s;o|phi&s;try have been &s;ubtile enough to throw mi&s;ts, which have darkened their own eyes. To find means of perplexing that univer&s;al principle upon which every que&s;tion of ju|&s;tice, between one man and another, is to be decided, they have enquired whether a man, con&s;cious to him&s;elf of unrea&s;onable wi&s;hes, be bound to gratify them in another. But &s;urely there needed no long delibera|tion to conclude, that the de&s;ires, which are to be con&s;idered by us as the mea&s;ure of right,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
mu&s;t be &s;uch as we approve, and that we ought to pay no regard to tho&s;e expectations in others which we condemn in our&s;elves, and which, however they may intrude upon our imagination, we know it our duty to re|&s;i&s;t and &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t celebrated ca&s;es which have been produced as requiring &s;ome &s;kill in the direction of con&s;cience to adapt them to this great rule, is that of a criminal a&s;king mercy of his judge, who cannot but know that if he was in the &s;tate of the &s;upplicant, he &s;hould de&s;ire that pardon which he now denies. The difficulty of this &s;ophi&s;m will vani&s;h, if we remember that the parties are in reality on one &s;ide criminal, and on the o|ther the community of which the magi&s;trate is only the mini&s;ter, and by which he is in|tru&s;ted with the publick &s;afety. The magi|&s;trate therefore in pardoning a man unwor|thy of pardon, betrays the tru&s;t with which he is inve&s;ted, gives away what is not his own, and, apparently, does to others what he would not that others &s;hould do to him. Even the community, who&s;e right is &s;till great|er to arbitrary grants of mercy, is bound
<PB N="92" REF="93">
by tho&s;e laws which regard the great republick of mankind, and cannot ju&s;tify &s;uch forbear|ance as may promote wickedne&s;s, and le&s;&s;en the general confidence and &s;ecurity in which all have an equal intere&s;t, and which all are therefore bound to maintain. For this rea|&s;on the &s;tate has not a right to erect a gene|ral &s;anctuary for fugitives, or give protec|tion to &s;uch as have forfeited their lives by crimes again&s;t the laws of common morality equally acknowledged by all nations, becau&s;e no people can, without infraction of the uni|ver&s;al league of &s;ocial beings, incite, by pro&s;pects of impunity and &s;afety, tho&s;e practi|ces in another dominion, which they would them&s;elves puni&s;h in their own.</P>
<P>ONE occa&s;ion of uncertainty and he&s;ita|tion, in tho&s;e by whom this great rule has been commented and dilated, is the confu&s;ion of what the ca&s;ui&s;ts are careful to di&s;tingui&s;h, <HI>debts of ju&s;tice and debts of charity.</HI> The im|mediate and primary intention of this pre|cept, is to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule of ju&s;tice for the tribunal of con&s;cience; and I know not whether invention, or &s;ophi&s;try, can &s;tart a &s;ingle difficulty to retard its application, when
<PB N="93" REF="94">
it is thus expre&s;&s;ed and explained, <HI>let every man allow the claim of right in another which he &s;hould think him&s;elf entitled to make in the like circum&s;tances.</HI></P>
<P>THE di&s;charge of the <HI>debts of charity,</HI> or duties which we owe to others not merely as required by ju&s;tice, but as dictated by benevo|lence, admits in its own nature greater com|plication of circum&s;tances and greater latitude of choice. Ju&s;tice is indi&s;pen&s;ably and uni|ver&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, and what is nece&s;&s;ary mu&s;t always be limited, uniform, and di&s;tinct. But beneficence though in general equally en|joined by our religion, and equally needful to the conciliation of the divine favour, is yet, for the mo&s;t part, with regard to its &s;in|gle acts, elective and voluntary. We may cer|tainly, without injury to our fellow beings, allow in the di&s;tribution of kindne&s;s &s;ome|thing to our affections, and change the mea|&s;ure of our liberality according to our opini|ons and pro&s;pects, our hopes and fears. This rule therefore is not equally determinate and ab&s;olute with re&s;pect to offices of kindne&s;s, and acts of liberality, becau&s;e liberality and kindne&s;s, ab&s;olutely determined, would lo&s;e their nature; for how could we be called ten|der,
<PB N="94" REF="95">
or charitable, for giving that which we are po&s;itively forbidden to withhold.</P>
<P>YET even in adju&s;ting the extent of our beneficence no other mea&s;ure can be taken than this precept affords us, for we can only know what others &s;uffer or want, by con|&s;idering how we &s;hould be affected in the &s;ame &s;tate; nor can we proportion our a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance by any other rule than that of doing what we &s;hould then expect from others. It indeed generally happens that the giver and receiver differ in their opinions of genero&s;ity; the &s;ame partiality to his own intere&s;t inclines one to large expectations, and the other to &s;paring di&s;tributions. Perhaps the infirmity of hu|man nature will &s;carcely &s;uffer a man groan|ing under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s, to judge rightly of the kindne&s;s of his friends, or to think they have done enough till his deliver|ance is compleated; it is therefore apparent that not what we might wi&s;h, but what we could demand from others, we are obliged to grant, &s;ince, though we can ea&s;ily know how much we might claim, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|termine what we &s;hould hope.</P>
<P>BUT in all enquiries concerning the prac|tice of voluntary and occa&s;ional virtues, it is
<PB N="95" REF="96">
&s;afe&s;t for minds not oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uper&s;ti|tious fears to determine again&s;t their own in|clinations, and &s;ecure them&s;elves from defici|ency by being more than they believe &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary. For of this every man may be certain that, if he were to exchange condi|tions with his dependent, he &s;hould expect more than, with the utmo&s;t exertion of his ardour, he now will prevail upon him&s;elf to perform; and when our rea&s;on has no &s;ettled rule, and our pa&s;&s;ions are &s;triving to mi&s;lead us, it is &s;urely the part of a wi&s;e man to err on the &s;ide of &s;afety.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SUPPOSE it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;olicit your good will by any formal preface or apology, when I have informed you, that I have long been known in the world of learning, as the mo&s;t laborious and zealous virtuo&s;o that the pre&s;ent age has had the honour of producing, and that the in|conveniencies which I now &s;uffer, have been been brought upon me by an unex|tingui&s;hable ardour of curio&s;ity, and an un|&s;haken per&s;everance in the acqui&s;ition of all the productions of art and nature.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved, from my entrance into the world, that I had &s;omething uncommon in my di&s;po&s;ition, and that there appeared in me very early tokens of genius, &s;uperior to the bulk of mankind. I was always an ene|my
<PB N="97" REF="98">
to trifles; the play things which my mo|ther be&s;towed upon me I immediately broke that I might di&s;cover the method of their &s;tructure, and the cau&s;es of their motions; of all the toys with which children are de|llghted I valued only my coral, and as &s;oon as I could &s;peak, a&s;ked, like <HI>Peire&s;c,</HI> innu|merable que&s;tions which the maids about me could not re&s;olve. As I grew older I was more thoughtful and &s;erious, and in&s;tead of amu&s;ing my&s;elf with puerile diver&s;ions, made collections of natural rarities, and never walked into the fields without bringing home &s;tones of remarkable forms, or in&s;ects of &s;ome uncommon &s;pecies. I never entered an old hou&s;e, from which I did not take away the painted gla&s;s, and often lamented that I was not one of that happy generation who demoli&s;hed the convents and mona&s;teries, and broke windows by law.</P>
<P>BEING thus early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a ta&s;te for folid knowledge, I pa&s;&s;ed my youth with very little di&s;turbance from pa&s;&s;ions and ap|petites, and having no plea&s;ure in the com|pany of boys and girls, who talked of plays,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
politicks, fa&s;hions, or love, I carried on my enquiries with ince&s;&s;ant diligence, and had ama&s;&s;ed more &s;tones, mo&s;&s;es, and &s;hells, than are to be found in many celebrated collec|tions, at an age in which the greate&s;t part of young men arc &s;tudying under tutors, or endeavouring to recommend them&s;elves to notice by their dre&s;s, their air, and their levities.</P>
<P>WHEN I was two and twenty years old, I became, by the death of my father, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall e&s;tate in land, with a very large &s;um of money in the public funds, and mu&s;t confe&s;s that I did not much lament him, for he was a man of mean parts, bent rather upon growing rich than wi&s;e. He once fretted at the expence of only ten &s;hil|lings, which he happened to overhear me of|fering for the &s;ting of a hornet, though it was a cold moi&s;t &s;ummer, in which very few hornets had been &s;een. He often recom|mended to me the &s;tudy of phy&s;ick, in which, &s;aid he, you may at once gratify your curio|&s;ity after natural hi&s;tory, and encrea&s;e your fortune by benefiting mankind. I heard him, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> with pity, and as there
<PB N="99" REF="100">
was no pro&s;pect of elevating a mind formed to grovel, &s;uffered him to plea&s;e him&s;elf with hoping that I &s;hould &s;ometime follow his ad|vice. For you know that there are men, with whom, when they have once &s;ettled a notion in their heads, it is to very little pur|po&s;e to di&s;pute.</P>
<P>BEING now left wholly to my own in|clinations, I very &s;oon enlarged the bounds of my curio&s;ity, and contented my&s;elf no longer with &s;uch rarities as required only judgment and indu&s;try, and when once found, might be had for nothing. I now turned my thoughts to <HI>Exoticks</HI> and <HI>Antiques,</HI> and became &s;o well known for my generous patronage of ingenious men, that my levee was crowded with vi&s;itants, &s;ome to &s;ee my mu&s;eum, and others to encrea&s;e its trea&s;ures, by &s;elling me whatever they had brought from other countries.</P>
<P>I HAD always a contempt of that narrow|ne&s;s of conception, which contents it&s;elf with cultivating &s;ome &s;ingle corner of the field of &s;cience; I took the whole region into my view, and wi&s;hed it of yet greater extent. But no man's power can be equal to his will.
<PB N="100" REF="101">
I was forced to proceed by &s;low degrees, and to purcha&s;e what chance, or kindne&s;s hap|pened to pre&s;ent. I did not, however, pro|ceed without &s;ome de&s;ign, or imitate the in|di&s;cretion of tho&s;e, who begin a thou&s;and col|lections, and fini&s;h none. Having been al|ways a lover of geography, I determined to collect the maps drawn in the rude and bar|barous times, before any regular &s;urveys, or ju&s;t ob&s;ervations; and have, at a great ex|pence, brought together a volume, in which, perhaps, not a &s;ingle country is laid down according to its true &s;ituation, and by which, he that de&s;ires to know the errors of the an|tient geographers, may be amply informed.</P>
<P>I DID not &s;uffer my&s;elf, however, to neglect the products of our own country; but as <HI>Alfred</HI> received the tribute of the <HI>Welch</HI> in Wolves heads, I allowed my tenants to pay their rents in butterflies, till I had exhau&s;ted the papilionaceous tribe. I then directed them to the pur&s;uit of other animals, and obtained, by this ea&s;y method, mo&s;t of the grubs and in&s;ects, which land, air, or water can &s;upply.
<PB N="101" REF="102">
I have three &s;pecies of earthworms not known to the naturali&s;ts, have di&s;covered a new ephe|mera, and can &s;hew four wa&s;ps that were taken torpid in their winter quarters. I have, from my own ground, the longe&s;t blade of gra&s;s upon record, and once accepted, as a half year's rent for a field of wheat, an ear containing more grains than had been &s;een before upon a &s;ingle &s;tem.</P>
<P>ONE of my tenants &s;o much neglected his own intere&s;t, as to &s;upply me, in a whole &s;ummer, with only two hor&s;e-flies, and tho&s;e of little more than the common &s;ize; and I was upon the brink of &s;eizing for arrears, when his good fortune threw a white mole in his way, for which he was not only for|given, but rewarded.</P>
<P>THESE, however, were petty acqui&s;itions and made at &s;mall expence, nor &s;hould I have ventured to rank my&s;elf among the virtuo&s;i without better claims. I have &s;uffered no|thing worthy the regard of a wi&s;e man to e&s;cape my notice: I have ran&s;acked the old
<PB N="102" REF="103">
and the new world, and been equally atten|tive to pa&s;t ages and the pre&s;ent. For the illu&s;tration of antient hi&s;tory, I can &s;hew a marble, of which the in&s;cription, though it is not now legible, appears from &s;ome broken remains of the letters, to have been <HI>Tu&s;|can,</HI> and therefore probably engraved be|fore the foundation of <HI>Rome.</HI> I have two pieces of porphyry found among the ruins of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and three letters broken off by a learned traveller from the monuments at <HI>Per|&s;epolis</HI>; a piece of &s;tone which paved the <HI>Areo|pagus</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> and a plate without figures or characters, which was found at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and which I therefore believe to be that metal, which was once valued before gold. I have &s;and gathered out of the <HI>Granicus</HI>; a fragment of <HI>Trajan</HI>'s bridge over the <HI>Danube</HI>; &s;ome of the mortar which cemented the water|cour&s;e of <HI>Tarquin</HI>; a hor&s;e &s;hoe broken on the <HI>Flaminian</HI> way; and a turf with five dai&s;ies dug from the field of <HI>Phar&s;alia.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not wi&s;h to rai&s;e the envy of un&s;uc|ce&s;sful collectors, by too pompous a di&s;play
<PB N="103" REF="104">

I flatter my&s;elf that I am writing to a man who will rejoice at the honour which my labours have procured to my country, and therefore, I &s;hall tell you that <HI>Britain</HI> can by my care boa&s;t of a &s;nail that has crawled upon the wall of <HI>China</HI>; a humming bird which an <HI>American</HI> prince&s;s wore in her ear; the tooth of an elephant who carried the queen of <HI>Siam</HI>; the &s;kin of an ape that was kept in the palace of the great mogul; a ribbon that adorned one of the maids of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> &s;ultana; and a &s;ymeter once wielded by a &s;oldier of <HI>Alas</HI> the great.</P>

IN collecting antiquities of every country, I have been careful to chu&s;e only by intrin&s;ick worth, and real u&s;efulne&s;s without regard to party or opinions.

<P>THE publication of the letter in my la&s;t paper has naturally led me to the con|&s;ideration
<PB N="106" REF="107">
of that thir&s;t after curio&s;ities, which often draws contempt and ridicule upon it&s;elf, but which is perhaps no otherwi&s;e blameable, than as it wants tho&s;e circum&s;tantial recom|mendations which have long been ob&s;erved to add lu&s;tre even to moral excellencies, and are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the grace and beauty of indifferent actions.</P>
<P>LEARNING confers &s;o much &s;uperiority on tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, that they might pro|bably have e&s;caped all cen&s;ure, had they been able to agree among them&s;elves: but as envy and competition have divided the republick of letters into factions, they have neglected the common intere&s;t; each has called in foreign aid, and endeavoured to &s;trengthen his own cau&s;e by the frown of power, the hi&s;s of ig|norance, and the clamour of popularity. They have all been &s;o much engaged in de&s;truction, that they have neglected defence, till by mu|tual ho&s;tilities they demoli&s;hed tho&s;e outworks which veneration had rai&s;ed for their &s;ecurity, and laid them&s;elves open to invaders, by whom every region of &s;cience is equally laid wa&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">
THERE pa&s;&s;es between men of different &s;tudies and profe&s;&s;ions a con&s;tant reciproca|tion of reproaches. The collector of &s;hells and &s;tones, wonders at the folly of him who pa&s;tes leaves and flowers upon paper, plea&s;es him&s;elf with colours that are perpetually fad|ing, and ama&s;&s;es with care what cannot be pre&s;erved. The hunter of in&s;ects &s;tands a|mazed that any man can wa&s;te much of his &s;hort time upon lifele&s;s matter, while many tribes of animals are yet neglected. Every one is inclined not only to promote his own &s;tudy, but to exclude all others from regard, and having heated his imagination with &s;ome favourite pur&s;uit, wonders that the re&s;t of mankind are not &s;eized with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, many &s;ubjects of &s;tudy which &s;eem but remotely allied to u&s;e|ful knowledge, and are of little importance to happine&s;s or virtue; nor is it ea&s;y to for|bear &s;ome &s;allies of merriment, or expre&s;|&s;ions of pity, when we &s;ee a man wrinkled with attention, and emaciated with &s;olici|tude in the inve&s;tigation of que&s;tions never to be re&s;olved, and of which, without any
<PB N="108" REF="109">
vi&s;ible harm, the world may expire in ig|norance. Yet it is dangerous to di&s;courage any well intended labours, or &s;uppre&s;s any innocent curio&s;ity; for he who is employ|ed in &s;earches, which by any deduction of con&s;equences tend to the benefit of life, is &s;urely laudable, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e who &s;pend their time in counteracting happine&s;s, and filling the world with wrong and dan|ger, confu&s;ion and remor&s;e. No man can perform &s;o little, as not to have rea&s;on to congratulate him&s;elf on his merits, when he beholds the multitudes that live in total idlene&s;s, and have never yet endeavoured to be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to determine the limits of any enquiry, or to fore&s;ee what con&s;equen|ces a new di&s;covery may produce. He who &s;uffers not his faculties to lie torpid, has a chance, whatever be his employment, of doing good to his fellow-creatures. There are probably in every part of nature pow|ers and qualities yet undi&s;covered, which might be applied to the advantage of man|kind, but which can never be known with|out the labour of experiment. He who fir&s;t ranged the woods in &s;earch of medicinal &s;prings, or climbed the mountains for &s;alu|tary
<PB N="109" REF="110">
plants, has undoubtedly merited the gratitude of po&s;terity, how much &s;oever his frequent mi&s;carriages might excite the &s;corn of his contemporaries. If what appears lit|tle be univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, nothing greater can be attained, for whatever is great was at fir&s;t little, and ro&s;e to its pre&s;ent bulk by gradual acce&s;&s;ions, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive improvements, and accumulated labours.</P>
<P>THOSE who lay out their time or their money in a&s;&s;embling matter for contempla|tion, and forming repo&s;itories of natural or ar|tificial rarities, are &s;urely entitled to &s;ome de|gree of re&s;pect, though in a flight of gaiety it be ea&s;y to ridicule their trea&s;ure, or in a fit of fullenne&s;s to de&s;pi&s;e it. A man goes not a|way much illuminated by having enjoyed the privilege of handling the tooth of a &s;hark, or the paw of a white bear; yet though &s;ome particular curio&s;ities may be rated by their owners beyond their value, there is nothing more worthy of admiration to a philo&s;ophical eye than the &s;tructure of ani|mals, by which they are qualified to &s;up|port life in the particular elements or cli|mates to which they are appropriated; and
<PB N="110" REF="111">
of all natural productions it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that they exhibit evidences of infi|nite wi&s;dom, bear their te&s;timony to the &s;upreme rea&s;on, and excite in the mind new raptures of admiration, and new incentives to piety.</P>
<P>TO collect the productions of art and ex|amples of mechanical &s;cience or manual a|bility is unque&s;tionably u&s;eful, even when the things them&s;elves are of &s;mall impor|tance, becau&s;e it is always advantageous to know how far the human powers have pro|ceeded, and how much experience has &s;hewn to be within the reach of diligence. It is natural for idlene&s;s and timidity to de&s;pair without being overcome, and to forbear attempts for fear of being defeated; and we may promote the invigoration of faint en|deavours, by being able to prove what has been already performed; for though it may &s;ometimes happen that the greate&s;t in&s;tances of ingenuity have been exerted in trifles, yet the &s;ame principles and the &s;ame expedients may be applied to more important purpo&s;es, and the movements which put into action machines of no other u&s;e but to rai&s;e the
<PB N="111" REF="112">
wonder of ignorance, may be employed to drain fens, or manufacture metals, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the architect, or pre&s;erve the &s;ailor.</P>
<P>FOR the uten&s;ils, arms, or dre&s;&s;es of foreign nations, which make the greate&s;t part of many collections, I have no great regard when they are valuable only becau&s;e they are foreign, and can &s;ugge&s;t no im|provement of our own practice. Yet they are not all equally u&s;ele&s;s, nor can it be always &s;afely determined, which &s;hould be rejected or retained, for they may &s;ometimes unex|pectedly contribute to the illu&s;tration of hi|&s;tory, to the knowledge of the natural com|modities of the country, or of the genius and cu&s;toms of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>THERE IS one &s;ort of rarities of a yet lower rank, which owe their value merely to accident, and which can convey no in|formation, nor &s;atisfy any rational de&s;ire. Such are many fragments of antiquity, as urns and pieces of pavement; and things which are held in veneration only for hav|ing been once the property of &s;ome eminent per&s;on, as the armour of king <HI>Henry</HI>; or for having been u&s;ed on &s;ome remarkable oc|ca&s;ion,
<PB N="112" REF="113">
as the lanthorn of <HI>Guy Faux.</HI> The lo&s;s or pre&s;ervation of the&s;e &s;eems to be a thing indifferent, nor can I perceive why the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them &s;hould be coveted. Yet, perhaps, even this curio&s;ity is implanted by nature; and when I find <HI>Tully</HI> confe&s;&s;ing of him&s;elf, that he could not forbear at <HI>Athens</HI> to vi&s;it the walks and hou&s;es which the old philo&s;ophers had frequented or inhabited, and recollect the reverence which every nation, civil and barbarous, has paid to the ground where merit has been buried, I am afraid to declare again&s;t the general voice of mankind, and am inclined to believe, that this regard, which we involuntarily pay to the meane&s;t relique of a man great and illu&s;trious, is in|tended as an incitement to labour, and an encouragement to expect the &s;ame renown, if it be &s;ought by the &s;ame virtues.</P>
<P>THE virtuo&s;o therefore cannot be cen&s;ured, as contributing nothing to the encrea&s;e of knowledge, but perhaps he may be &s;ometimes ju&s;tly culpable for con&s;ining him&s;elf to bu&s;i|ne&s;s below his genius, for lo&s;ing in trifling amu&s;ements and petty &s;peculations, tho&s;e hours which he might have &s;pent in nobler &s;tudies, and in which he might have given
<PB N="113" REF="114">
new light to the intellectual world. It is in|deed never without grief, that I find a man capable of ratiocination or invention enli&s;t|ing him&s;elf in this &s;econdary cla&s;s of learning; for when he has once di&s;covered a method of gratifying his de&s;ire of eminence by expence rather than by labour, and known the &s;weets of a life ble&s;t at once with the ea&s;e of idlene&s;s, and the reputation of knowledge, he will not ea&s;ily be brought to undergo again the toil of thinking, or leave his toys and his trinkets for arguments and ideas, arguments which re|quire circum&s;pection and vigilance, and ideas which cannot be obtained but by the drudgery of meditation. He will gladly &s;hut him&s;elf up forever with his &s;hells and medals, like the companions of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who having ta&s;ted the fruit of <HI>Lotos,</HI> would not even by the hope of &s;eeing their own country, be tempt|ed again to the dangers of the &s;ea. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>COLLECTIONS of this kind are of u&s;e to the learned, as heaps of &s;tone and piles of timber are nece&s;&s;ary to the architect. But to dig the quarry or to &s;earch the field, requires
<PB N="114" REF="115">
not much of any quality, beyond &s;tubborn per|&s;everance; and though genius mu&s;t often lye inactive without this humble and neglected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet this can claim little prai&s;e be|cau&s;e every man can afford it.</P>
<P>TO mean under&s;tandings, it is indeed &s;uf|ficient honour to be numbered among&s;t the lowe&s;t labourers of learning; but &s;urely dif|ferent abilities mu&s;t find different ta&s;ks. To hew &s;tone would have been unworthy of <HI>Pal|ladio,</HI> and to have rambled in &s;earch of &s;hells and flowers, had but ill &s;uited with the capa|city of <HI>Newton.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;eem in all your papers to be an enemy to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and to look with indifference and impar|tiality upon the world; I &s;hall therefore lay my ca&s;e before you with great confidence, and hope by your deci&s;ion to be &s;et free from the unrea&s;onable re&s;traints which I now &s;uffer, and enabled to ju&s;tify my&s;elf again&s;t the ac|cu&s;ations which &s;pite and peevi&s;hne&s;s produce again&s;t me.</P>
<P>AT the age of five years I lo&s;t my mother, and my father being a man in public employ|ment,
<PB N="116" REF="117">
and neither by his &s;ituation or temper very well qualified to &s;uperintend the educa|tion of a girl, committed me to the care of his &s;i&s;ter, a woman of virtue and di&s;cretion, who in&s;tructed me with the authority, and, not to deny her what &s;he may ju&s;tly claim, with the affection of a parent. She had not in|deed very elevated &s;entiments or exten&s;ive views, but her principles were good, and her intentions pure, and though &s;ome may prac|ti&s;e more virtues, &s;carce any commit fewer faults.</P>
<P>UNDER this good lady I learned all the common rules of decent behaviour, and all the &s;tanding maxims of dome&s;tick prudence; and might have grown up by degrees to a country gentlewoman, without any thoughts of ranging beyond the neighbourhood, had not <HI>Flavia</HI> come down, la&s;t &s;ummer, to vi&s;it her relations in the next village. I was taken, of cour&s;e, to compliment the &s;tranger, and was, at the fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;urprized at the un|concern with which &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf gazed at by company whom &s;he had never known be|fore; at the carele&s;ne&s;s with which &s;he receiv|ed
<PB N="117" REF="118">
compliments, and the readine&s;s with which &s;he returned them. I found &s;he had &s;ome|thing which I perceived my&s;elf to want, and could not but wi&s;h to be like her, at once ea&s;y and officious, attentive and unembarra&s;|&s;ed. I went home, and for four days could think and talk of nothing but mi&s;s <HI>Flavia</HI>; though my aunt told me, that &s;he was a forward flirt, and thought her&s;elf wi&s;e before her time.</P>
<P>IN a little time &s;he repaid my vi&s;it, and rai&s;ed im my heart a new confu&s;ion of love, e&s;teem, and admiration. I &s;oon &s;aw her again, and &s;till found new charms in her air, beha|viour, and conver&s;ation. You who have known the world may, perhaps, have ob&s;erved, that formality &s;oon cea&s;es between young per|&s;ons. I know not, indeed, how others are affected on &s;uch occa&s;ions, but I found my|&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly allured to friend&s;hip and inti|macy, by the familiar complai&s;ance and airy gaiety of <HI>Flavia,</HI> &s;o that in a few weeks I became her favourite, and all the time was pa&s;&s;ed with me, that &s;he could gain from ceremony and cards.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119">
AS &s;he came often to me, &s;he nece&s;&s;arily &s;pent &s;ome hours with my aunt, to whom &s;he paid great re&s;pect, by low courte&s;ies, &s;ub|mi&s;ive compliance, and &s;oft acquie&s;cence; but as I became gradually more accu&s;tomed to her manners, I di&s;covered that her civility was general; that there was a certain degree of deference &s;hewn by her to circum&s;tances and appearances; that many went away flat|tered by her humility, whom &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed in her heart; that the influence of far the great|e&s;t part of tho&s;e with whom &s;he conver&s;ed, cea&s;ed with their pre&s;ence; and that &s;ome|times &s;he did not remember the names of them whom, without any intentional in&s;inceri|ty or fal&s;e commendation, her habitual civility had &s;ent away with very high thoughts of their own importance.</P>
<P>IT was not long before I perceived, that my aunt's opinion was not of much weight in <HI>Flavia</HI>'s deliberations, and that &s;he was looked upon by her as a woman of nar|row &s;entiments, without knowledge of books, or ob&s;ervations on mankind. I had hitherto con&s;idered my aunt, as entitled by her wi&s;|dom and experience to the highe&s;t reverence, and could not forbear to wonder that any one
<PB N="119" REF="120">
&s;o much younger &s;hould venture to &s;u&s;pect her of error, or of ignorance; but my &s;ur|prize was without unea&s;ine&s;s, and being now accu&s;tomed to think <HI>Flavia</HI> always in the right, I very readily learned from her to tru&s;t my own rea&s;on, to con&s;ider every que|&s;tion for my&s;elf, and to believe it po&s;&s;ible, that they who had lived longer might be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>FLAVIA had read much, and u&s;ed &s;o often to conver&s;e on &s;ubjects of learning, that &s;he put all the men in the county to flight, except the old par&s;on, who declared him&s;elf much delighted with her company, becau&s;e &s;he gave him opportunity to recollect the &s;tudies of his younger years, and had made him rub the du&s;t off his <HI>Homer</HI> which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ain unregarded in his clo&s;et. With <HI>Homer</HI> and a thou&s;and other names familiar to <HI>Flavia,</HI> I had no acquaintance, but be|gan by comparing her accompli&s;hments with my own, to repine at my education, and wi&s;h that I had not been &s;o long confined to the company of tho&s;e from whom nothing but hou&s;ewifery was to be learned. I then
<PB N="118" REF="121">
&s;et my&s;elf to peru&s;e &s;uch books as <HI>Flavia</HI> re|commended, and heard her opinion of their beauties and defects. I &s;aw new worlds hourly bur&s;ting upon my mind, and was en|raptured at the pro&s;pect of diver&s;ifying life with endle&s;s entertainment.</P>
<P>THE old lady finding that a large &s;creen, which I had undertaken to adorn with tur|key-work again&s;t winter, made very &s;low advances and that I had added in two months but three leaves to a flowered apron then in the frame, &s;oon took the alarm, and with all the zeal of hone&s;t folly exclaimed again&s;t my new acquaintance, who had filled me with idle notions, and turned my head with books. But &s;he had now lo&s;t her authority, for I began to find innumerable mi&s;takes in her opinions, and improprieties in her lan|guage; and therefore thought my&s;elf no longer bound to pay much regard to one who knew little beyond her needle and her dairy, and who profe&s;&s;ed to think that nothing more is required of a woman than to &s;ee that the hou&s;e is clean, and that the maids go to bed and ri&s;e at a certain hour.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">
SHE &s;eemed however to look upon <HI>Flavia</HI> as &s;educing me, and to imagine that when her influence was withdrawn, I &s;hould re|turn to my allegiance; &s;he therefore content|ed her&s;elf with remote hints, and gentle ad|monitions, intermixed with &s;age hi&s;tories of the mi&s;carriages of wit, and di&s;appointments of pride. But &s;ince &s;he has found, that, tho' <HI>Flavia</HI> is departed, I &s;till per&s;i&s;t in my new &s;cheme, &s;he has at length lo&s;t her patience; &s;he &s;natches my book out of my hand, tears my paper if &s;he finds me writing, burns <HI>Fla|via</HI>'s letters before my face if &s;he can &s;eize them, and threatens to lock me up, and to complain to my father of my perver&s;ene&s;s. If women, &s;he &s;ays, would but know their du|ty and their intere&s;t, they would be careful to acquaint them&s;elves with family affairs, and many a penny might be &s;aved; for while the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e is &s;cribbling and reading, &s;ervants are junketing, and linnen is wear|ing out. She then takes me round the rooms, &s;hews me the worked hangings, and chairs of tent-&s;tich, and a&s;ks whether all this was done with a pen and a book.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="123">
I CANNOT deny that I &s;ometimes laugh, and &s;ometimes am &s;ullen, but &s;he has not delicacy enough to be much moved either with my mirth or my gloom, if &s;he did not think the intere&s;t of the family endangered by this change of my manners. She had for &s;ome years marked out young Mr. <HI>Surly,</HI> an heir in the neighbourhood, remarkable for his love of fighting-cocks, as an advanta|geous match, and was extremely plea&s;ed with the civilities which he u&s;ed to pay me, till under <HI>Flavia</HI>'s tuition I learned to talk of &s;ubjects which he could not under&s;tand. This, &s;he &s;ays, is the con&s;equence of female &s;tudy; girls grow too wi&s;e to be advi&s;ed, and too &s;tubborn to be commanded; but &s;he is re|&s;olved to try who &s;hall govern, and will thwart my humour till &s;he breaks my &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THESE menaces, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> &s;ome|times make me quite angry; for I have been &s;ixteen, the&s;e ten weeks, and think my&s;elf exempted from the dominion of a governe&s;s, who has no preten&s;ions to more &s;en&s;e or knowledge than my&s;elf: I am re&s;olved, &s;ince I am as tall and as wi&s;e as other women, to be no longer treated like a girl. Mi&s;s <HI>Flavia</HI> has often told me, that ladies of my age go
<PB N="123" REF="124">

<P>MY aunt often tells me of the advantages of experience, and of the deference due to &s;eniority; and both &s;he and all the antiquated part of the world talk of the unre&s;erved obe|dience which they paid to the commands of their parents, and the undoubting confidence with which they li&s;tened to their precepts; of the terrors which they felt at a frown, and the humility with which they &s;upplicated for|givene&s;s whenever they had offended. I can|not but fancy that this boa&s;t is too general to be true, and that the young and the old were always at variance. I have, however, told my aunt that I will mend whatever &s;he will prove to be wrong; but &s;he replies that &s;he has rea&s;ons of her own, and that &s;he is &s;orry

<P>MANY writers of eminence in phy|&s;ick have laid out their diligence up|on the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e di&s;tempers to which men are more remarkably expo&s;ed by particular &s;tates of life, and very learned treati&s;es have been produced upon the mala|dies of the camp, the &s;ea, and the mines. There is, indeed, &s;carcely any employment which a man accu&s;tomed to anatomical en|quiries, and medical refinements, would not find rea&s;ons for declining as dangerous to health, did not his learning or experience in|form him, that almo&s;t every occupation, however inconvenient or formidable, is hap|pier and &s;afer than a life of &s;loth.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of action is not only de|mon&s;trable from the fabrick of the body, but evident from ob&s;ervation of the univer&s;al practice of mankind, who for the pre&s;erva|tion
<PB N="126" REF="127">
of health, in tho&s;e who&s;e rank or wealth exempts them from the nece&s;&s;ity of lucrative labour, have invented &s;ports and diver&s;ions, though not of equal u&s;e to the world with manual trades, yet of equal fa|tigue to tho&s;e that practi&s;e them, and differ|ing only from the drudgery of the hu&s;band|man or manufacturer, as they are acts of choice, and therefore performed without the painful &s;en&s;e of compul&s;ion. The hunt&s;man ri&s;es early, per&s;ues his game through all the dangers and ob&s;tructions of the cha&s;e, &s;wims rivers, and &s;cales precipices, till he returns home no le&s;s harra&s;&s;ed than the &s;oldier, and has, perhaps, &s;ometimes incurred as great hazard of wounds or death: Yet he has no motive to incite his ardour; he is neither &s;ubject to the commands of a general, nor dreads any penalties for neglect and di&s;obe|dience; he has neither profit or honour to expect from his perils and his conque&s;ts, but toils without the hope either of mutal or civick garlands, and mu&s;t content him&s;elf with the prai&s;e of his tenants and compa|nions.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch indeed is the con&s;titution of man, that labour may be with great ju&s;tice
<PB N="127" REF="128">
&s;tiled its own reward; nor will any external incitements be requi&s;ite, if it be con&s;idered how much happine&s;s is gained, and how much mi&s;ery e&s;caped by frequent and violent agita|tion of the body.</P>
<P>EASE is the utmo&s;t that can be hoped from a &s;edentary and unactive habit; ea&s;e a neutral &s;tate between pain and plea&s;ure. The dance of &s;pirits, the bound of vigour, readine&s;s of enterprize, and defiance of fatigue, are re&s;erved for him that braces his nerves, and hardens his fibres, that keeps his limbs pliant with motion, and by frequent expo&s;ure fortifies his frame again&s;t the com|mon accidents of cold and heat.</P>
<P>WITH ea&s;e, however, if it could be &s;e|cured, many would be content; but nothing terre&s;trial can be kept at a &s;tand. Ea&s;e, if it is not ri&s;ing into plea&s;ure, will be falling to|wards pain, and whatever hope the dreams of &s;peculation may &s;ugge&s;t of ob&s;erving the proportion between nutriment and labour, and keeping the body in a healthy &s;tate by &s;upplies exactly equal to its wa&s;te, we know that, in effect, the vital powers unexcited by motion, grow gradually languid; that as
<PB N="128" REF="129">
their vigour fails ob&s;tructions are generated; and that from ob&s;tructions proceed mo&s;t of tho&s;e pains which wear us away &s;lowly with periodical tortures, and which though they &s;ometimes &s;uffer life to be long, condemn it to be u&s;ele&s;s, chain us down on the couch of mi&s;ery, and mock us with the hopes of death.</P>
<P>EXERCISE, indeed, cannot &s;ecure us from that di&s;&s;olution to which we are de|creed; but while the &s;oul and body conti|nue united, it can make the a&s;&s;ociation plea|&s;ing, and can give probable hopes that they &s;hall be disjoined by an ea&s;y &s;eparation. It was a principle among the ancients, that acute di&s;ea&s;es are from heaven, and chronical from our&s;elves; the dart of death indeed falls from heaven, but we poi&s;on it by our own mi&s;conduct; to dye is the fate of man, but to dye with lingering angui&s;h is generally his folly.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to that perfection of which our pre&s;ent &s;tate is capable, that the mind and body &s;hould both be kept in action; that neither the faculties of the one nor of the other be &s;uffered to grow lax or torpid
<PB N="129" REF="130">
for want of u&s;e; that neither health be pur|cha&s;ed by voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to ignorance, nor knowledge cultivated at the expence of that health, which mu&s;t enable it either to give plea&s;ure to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to others. It is too frequently the pride of &s;tudents to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e amu&s;ements and re|creations which give to the re&s;t of mankind &s;trength of limbs and cheerfulne&s;s of heart. Solitude and contemplation are indeed &s;eldom con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch &s;kill in common exerci&s;es or &s;ports as is nece&s;&s;ary to make them practi|&s;ed with delight, and no man is willing to do that of which the nece&s;&s;ity is not pre&s;|&s;ing and immediate, when he knows that his aukwardne&s;s mu&s;t make him ridiculous. <Q><L>Ludere qui ne&s;cit, campe&s;tribus ab&s;tinet armis,</L>

<P>THUS the man of learning is often re|&s;igned, almo&s;t by his own con&s;ent, to lan|guor and to pain; and while in the pro&s;e|cution of his &s;tudies he &s;uffers the wearine&s;s of labour, is &s;ubject by his cour&s;e of life to the maladies of idlene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
IT was, perhaps, from the ob&s;ervation of this mi&s;chievous omi&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e who are employed about intellectual objects, that <HI>Locke</HI> has, in his <HI>Sy&s;tem of Education,</HI> &s;o warmly urged the nece&s;&s;ity of a manual trade to men of all ranks and profe&s;&s;ions, that when the mind is weary with its proper ta&s;k, it may be relaxed by a &s;lighter attention to &s;ome mechanical operation; and that while the vital functions are re&s;u&s;citated and awa|kened by vigorous motion, the under&s;tanding may be re&s;trained from that vagrance and di&s;&s;ipation by which it too often relieves it|&s;elf after a long inten&s;ene&s;s of thought, un|le&s;s &s;ome allurement be pre&s;ented that may engage application without anxiety.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;o little rea&s;on for expecting any frequent conformity to <HI>Locke</HI>'s precept, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to enquire whether the practice of manual arts might not give occa|&s;ion to petty emulation, and trivial ambition; and whether, if our divines and phy&s;icians were taught the lathe and the chizzel, they would not think more of their tools than their books; as <HI>Nero</HI> neglected the care of his empire for his chariot and his fiddle. It is certainly dangerous to be too much plea&s;ed
<PB N="131" REF="132">
with little things; but what is there which may not be perverted? let us, remember how much wor&s;e employment might have been found for tho&s;e hours, which a manual occupation appears to engro&s;s; let us com|pute the profit with the lo&s;s, and when we reflect how often a genius is allured from his &s;tudies, con&s;ider likewi&s;e that perhaps by the &s;ame attractions he is &s;ometimes withheld from debauchery, or recalled from malice, from ambition, from envy, and from lu&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE always admired the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e by whom our female education was in|&s;tituted, for having contrived, that every woman of whatever condition &s;hould be taught &s;ome arts of manufacture, by which the vacuities of reclu&s;e and dome&s;tick lei&s;ure may always be filled up. The&s;e arts are more nece&s;&s;ary as the weakne&s;s of their &s;ex and the general &s;y&s;tem of life debar ladies from many employments which by diver&s;ifying the circum&s;tances of men, pre&s;erve them from being cankered by the ru&s;t of their own thoughts. I know not how much of the virtue and happine&s;s of the world may be the con&s;equence of this judicious regulation. Perhaps, the mo&s;t powerful fancy might be
<PB N="132" REF="133">
unable to figure the confu&s;ion and &s;laughter that would be produced by &s;o many piercing eyes and vivid under&s;tandings, turned loo&s;e at once upon mankind, with no other bu&s;i|ne&s;s than to &s;parkle and intrigue, to perplex and to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>FOR my part, whenever chance brings within my ob&s;ervation a knot of mi&s;&s;es bu&s;y at their needles, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as in the &s;chool of virtue; and though I have no ex|traordinary &s;kill in plain work or embroide|ry, look upon their operations with, at lea&s;t, as much &s;atisfaction as their governe&s;s, be|cau&s;e I regard them as providing a &s;ecurity again&s;t the mo&s;t dangerous en&s;narers of the &s;oul, by enabling them&s;elves to exclude idle|ne&s;s from their &s;olitary moments, and with idlene&s;s her attendant train of pa&s;&s;ions, fan|cies, and chimeras, fears, &s;orrows and de|&s;ires. <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Cervantes</HI> will inform them that love has no power but over tho&s;e whom he catches unemployed; and <HI>Hector,</HI> in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> when he &s;ees <HI>Andromache</HI> overwhelmed with terrors, &s;ends her for con&s;olation to the loom and the di&s;taff.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">
IT is certain that any wild wi&s;h or vain imagination never takes &s;uch firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, as when it is found empty and unoccupied; for the old peripatetick princi|ple, that <HI>Nature abhors a Vacuum,</HI> may be properly applied to the intellect, which will embrace any thing however ab&s;urd or crimi|nal rather than be wholly without an object. Perhaps every man may date the predomi|nance of tho&s;e de&s;ires that di&s;turb his life and contaminate his con&s;cience, from &s;ome un|happy hour when too much lei&s;ure expo&s;ed him to their incur&s;ions; for he has lived with little ob&s;ervation either on him&s;elf or others, who does not know that to be idle is to be vicious.</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by one of the an|cients, that the burthen of government is encrea&s;ed upon princes by the virtues of their immediate predece&s;&s;ors. It is, indeed, always dangerous to be placed in a &s;tate of unavoidable compari&s;on with excellence, and the danger is &s;till greater when that excellence is con&s;ecrated by death, when envy and in|tere&s;t cea&s;e to act again&s;t it, and tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions by which it was at fir&s;t vilified and op|po&s;ed, now &s;tand in its defence, and turn their vehemence again&s;t hone&s;t emulation.</P>
<P>HE that &s;ucceeds a celebrated writer, has the &s;ame difficulties to encounter; he &s;tands under the &s;hade of exalted merit, and is hindered from ri&s;ing to his natural height, by the interception of tho&s;e beams which &s;hould invigorate and quicken him. He ap|plies to that attention which is already en|gaged,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
and unwilling to be drawn off from certain &s;atisfaction; or perhaps to an attention already wearied, and not to be recalled to the &s;ame object. One of the old poets congratu|lates him&s;elf that he has the untrodden regi|ons of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> before him, and that his garland will be gathered from plantations which no writer had yet culled. But the imi|tator treads a beaten walk, and with all his diligence can only hope to find a few flow|ers or branches untouched by his predece&s;&s;or, the refu&s;e of contempt, or the omi&s;&s;ions of negligence. The <HI>Macedonian</HI> conqueror, when he was once invited to hear a man that &s;ung like a nightingale, replied with con|tempt, "that he had heard the nightingale her&s;elf;" and the &s;ame treatment mu&s;t every man expect, who&s;e prai&s;e is, that he imitates another.</P>
<P>YET, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;couraging reflections, I am about to offer to my reader &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and hope, that however I may fall below the illu|&s;trious writer who &s;o long dictated to the commonwealth of learning, my attempt may not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s. There are in every
<PB N="136" REF="137">
age, new errors to be rectify'd, and new pre|judices to be oppo&s;ed. Fal&s;e ta&s;te is always bu&s;y to mi&s;lead tho&s;e that are entering upon the regions of learning; and the traveller, uncertain of his way, and for&s;aken by the &s;un, will be plea&s;ed to &s;ee a fainter orb ari&s;e on the horizon, that may re&s;cue him from total darkne&s;s, though with weak and bor|rowed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>ADDISON, though he has con&s;idered this poem under mo&s;t of the general topicks of critici&s;m, has barely touched upon the ver|&s;ification; not probably becau&s;e he thought the art of numbers unworthy of his notice, for he knew with how minute attention the ancient criticks con&s;idered the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;yllables, and had him&s;elf given hopes of &s;ome metrical ob&s;ervations upon that great <HI>Roman</HI> poet; but being the fir&s;t who under|took to di&s;play the beauties, and point out the defects of <HI>Milton,</HI> he had many objects at once before him, and pa&s;&s;ed willingly over tho&s;e which were mo&s;t barren of ideas, and required labour, rather than genius.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="138">
YET ver&s;ification, or the art of modulat|ing his Numbers, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to a poet. Every other power by which the at|tention is fixed, the under&s;tanding enlighten|ed, or the imagination enchanted, may be exerci&s;ed in pro&s;e. But the poet has this pe|culiar &s;uperiority, that to all the powers which the perfection of every other compo&s;ition can require, he adds the faculty of joining mu&s;ick with rea&s;on, and of acting at once upon the &s;en&s;es and the pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;uppo&s;e there are few who do not feel them&s;elves touched by poetical melody, and who will not confe&s;s that they are more or le&s;s moved by the &s;ame thoughts, as they are conveyed by dif|ferent &s;ounds, and more affected by the &s;ame words in one order, than in another. The perception of harmony is indeed con&s;erred upon men in degrees very unequal, but there are none who do not perceive it, or to whom a regular &s;eries of proportionate &s;ounds can|not give delight.</P>
<P>IN treating on the ver&s;ification of <HI>Mil|ton</HI> I am de&s;irous to be generally under&s;tood, and &s;hall therefore &s;tudiou&s;ly decline the dia|lect of grammarians; though, indeed, it is
<PB N="138" REF="139">
always difficult and &s;ometimes &s;carcely po&s;&s;i|ble to deliver the precepts of an art without the terms by which the peculiar ideas of that art are expre&s;&s;ed, and which had not been invented but becau&s;e the language already in u&s;e, was in&s;ufficient. If therefore I &s;hall &s;ometimes &s;eem ob&s;cure, may it be imputed to this voluntary interdiction, and to a de|&s;ire of avoiding that offence which is always given by unu&s;ual words.</P>
<P>THE heroic mea&s;ure of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage may be properly con&s;idered as pure or mixed. It is pure when the accent re&s;ts up|on every &s;econd &s;yllable through the whole line. <Q><L>Courage uncertain dangers may abate,</L>
<L>But wh&oacute; can be&aacute;r th' appr&oacute;ach of c&eacute;rtain f&aacute;te.</L>
 <BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>

<Q><L>Here love his golden &s;hafts employs, here lights</L>
<L>His c&oacute;n&s;tant l&aacute;mp, and w&aacute;ves his p&uacute;rple wings,</L>
<L>Reigns here, and revels; not in the bought &s;mile</L>
<L>Of h&aacute;rlots, l&oacute;vele&s;s, j&oacute;yle&s;s, &uacute;nend&eacute;ar'd.</L>
 <BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q> <PB N="139" REF="140">
The accent may be ob&s;erved in the &s;econd line of <HI>Dryden,</HI> and the &s;econd and fourth of <HI>Mil|ton,</HI> to repo&s;e upon every &s;econd &s;yllable.</P>
<P>THE repetition of this &s;ound or percu&s;|&s;ion at equal times is the mo&s;t complete har|mony of which a &s;ingle ver&s;e is capable, and &s;hould therefore be exactly kept in di|&s;tichs, and generally in the la&s;t line of a paragraph, that the ear may re&s;t without any &s;en&s;e of imperfection.</P>
<P>BUT, to pre&s;erve the &s;eries of &s;ounds un|tran&s;po&s;ed in a long compo&s;ition, is not only very difficult but tire&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting; for we are &s;oon wearied with the perpetual re|currence of the &s;ame cadence. Nece&s;&s;ity has therefore enforced the mixed mea&s;ure, in which &s;ome variation of the accents is allow|ed; this, though it always injures the har|mony of the line con&s;idered by it&s;elf, yet compen&s;ates the lo&s;s by relieving us from the continual tyranny of the &s;ame &s;ound, and makes us more &s;en&s;ible of the harmony of the pure mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e mixed numbers every poet affords us innumerable in&s;tances, and <HI>Milton</HI> &s;eldom
<PB N="140" REF="141">
has two pure lines together, as will appear if any of his paragraphs be read with attention merely to the mu&s;ick. <Q><L>Thus at their &s;hady lodge arriv'd both &s;tood,</L>
<L>Both turn'd and under open &s;ky adorn'd</L>
<L>The God that made both &s;ky, air, earth, and heav'n,</L>
<L>Which they beheld; the moon's re&s;plendent globe,</L>
<L><HI>And &s;tarry pole: thou al&s;o mad'&s;t the night,</HI></L>
<L>Maker omnipotent! and thou the day,</L>
<L>Which we in our appointed work employ'd</L>
<L>Have fini&s;h'd, happy in our mutual help,</L>
<L><HI>And mutual love, the crown of all our bli&s;s</HI></L>
<L>Ordain'd by thee; and this delicious place,</L>
<L>For us too large; where thy abundance wants</L>
<L>Partakers, and uncrop'd falls to the ground,</L>
<L>But thou ha&s;t promis'd from us two a race</L>
<L>To fill the earth, who &s;hall with us extol</L>
<L>Thy goodne&s;s infinite, both when we awake,</L>
<L>And when we &s;eek, as now, thy gift of &s;leep.</L></Q>In this pa&s;&s;age it will be at fir&s;t ob&s;erved, that all the lines are not equally harmonious, and upon a nearer examination it will be found that only the fifth and ninth lines are regular, and the re&s;t are more or le&s;s licentious with
<PB N="141" REF="142">
re&s;pect to the accent. In &s;ome the accent is equally upon two &s;yllables together, and in both &s;trong. As <Q><L>Thus at their &s;hady lodge arriv'd, <HI>both &s;tood,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Both turn'd,</HI> and under open &s;ky ador'd</L>
<L>The God that made both &s;ky, <HI>air, earth,</HI> and heav'n.</L></Q> In others the accent is equally upon two &s;yllables, but upon both weak. <Q><L>&mdash;a race</L>
<L>To fill the earth, who &s;hall with us extol</L>
<L>Thy goodne&s;s in<HI>finite,</HI> both when we wake,</L>
<L><HI>And when</HI> we &s;eek, as now, thy gift of &s;leep.</L></Q> In the fir&s;t pair of &s;yllables the accent may deviate from the rigour of exactne&s;s without any unplea&s;ing diminution of harmony, as may be ob&s;erved in the lines already cited, and more remarkably in this <Q><L>&mdash;Thou al&s;o mad'&s;t the night,</L>
<L><HI>Maker</HI> omnipotent! and thou the day.</L></Q> But, excepting in the fir&s;t pair of &s;yllables, which may be con&s;idered as arbitrary, a poet who, not having the invention or knowledge of <HI>Milton,</HI> has more need to allure his audi|ence by mu&s;ical cadences, &s;hould &s;eldom &s;uf|fer more than one aberration from the rule in any &s;ingle ver&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">
THERE are two lines in this pa&s;&s;age more remarkably unharmonious. <Q><L>&mdash;This delicious place,</L>
<L>For us too large; <HI>where thy</HI> abundance wants</L>
<L>Partakers, and uncrop'd <HI>falls to</HI> the ground.</L></Q>  Here the third pair of &s;yllables in the fir&s;t, and fourth pair in the &s;econd ver&s;e, have their accents retrograde or inverted; the fir&s;t &s;yl|lable being &s;trong or acute, and the &s;econd weak. The detriment which the mea&s;ure &s;uffers by this inver&s;ion of the accents is &s;ometimes le&s;s perceptible, when the ver&s;es are carried one into another, but is remarkably &s;triking in this place, where the vicious ver&s;e concludes a period; and is yet more offen|&s;ive in rhyme, when we regularly attend to the flow of every &s;ingle line. This will ap|pear by reading a couplet in which <HI>Cowley,</HI> an author not &s;ufficiently &s;tudious of harmony, has committed the &s;ame fault. <Q><L>&mdash;His harmle&s;s life</L>
<L>Does with &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;edne&s;s abound,</L>
<L>And the &s;oft wings of peace <HI>cover</HI> him round.</L></Q> In the&s;e the law of metre is very gro&s;sly vio|lated by mingling combinations of &s;ound di|rectly oppo&s;ite to each other, as <HI>Milton</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es it in his &s;onnet, by <HI>committing &s;hort</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="144">
<HI>and long,</HI> and &s;etting one part of the mea&s;ure as variance with the re&s;t. The ancients, who had a language more capable of variety than ours, had two kinds of ver&s;e, the <HI>lam|bick,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hort and long &s;yllables al|ternately, from which our heroick mea&s;ure is derived, and the <HI>Trochaick,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in a like alternation of long and &s;hort. The&s;e were con&s;idered as oppo&s;ites, and conveyed the contrary images of &s;peed and &s;lowne&s;s; to confound them, therefore, as in the&s;e lines, is to deviate from the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice.

<P>THAT few things are &s;o liberally be|&s;towed, or &s;quandered with &s;o little effect, as good advice, has been generally ob&s;erved; and many &s;age po&s;itions have been advanced concerning the rea&s;ons of this com|plaint, and the means of removing it. It is, indeed, an important and noble enquiry, for little would be wanting to the happine&s;s of life, if every man could conform to the right as &s;oon as he was &s;hown it.</P>
<P>THIS perver&s;e neglect of the mo&s;t &s;alutary precepts, and &s;tubborn re&s;i&s;tance of the mo&s;t pathetic per&s;ua&s;ion, is u&s;ually imputed to him by whom the coun&s;el is received, and we therefore often hear it mentioned as a &s;ign of hopele&s;s and abandoned depravity, that tho' good advice was given, it has wrought no re|formation.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">
OTHERS who imagine them&s;elves to have quicker &s;agacity and deeper penetration, have found out, that the inefficacy of advice is u|&s;ually the fault of the coun&s;ellor, and rules have therefore been laid down, by which this important duty may be &s;ucce&s;sfully per|formed: We are directed by what tokens to di&s;cover the favourable moment at which the heart is di&s;po&s;ed for the operation of truth and rea&s;on, with what addre&s;s to admini&s;ter and with what vehicles to di&s;gui&s;e <HI>the catharticks of the &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding this &s;pecious ex|pedient, we find the world yet in the &s;ame &s;tate; advice is &s;till given, but &s;till received with di&s;gu&s;t; nor has it appeared that the bitterne&s;s of the medicine has been yet abated, or its power encrea&s;ed by any methods of preparing it.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the manner in which tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume the office of directing the con|duct of others execute their undertaking, it will not be very wonderful that their labours, however zealous or affectionate, are fre|quently u&s;ele&s;s. For what is the advice that is commonly given? A few general max|ims,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
enforced with vehemence and inculcated with importunity, but failing for want of particular reference, and immediate appli|cation.</P>
<P>IT is not often that any man can have &s;o much knowledge of another, as is nece&s;&s;ary to make in&s;truction u&s;eful. We are &s;ome|times not our&s;elves con&s;cious of the original motives of our actions, and when we know them, our fir&s;t care is to hide them from the &s;ight of others, and often from tho&s;e mo&s;t di|ligently, who&s;e &s;uperiority either of power or under&s;tanding may intitle them to in|&s;pect our lives; it is therefore very probable that he who endeavours the cure of our intel|lectual maladies, mi&s;takes their cau&s;e; and that his pre&s;criptions avail nothing, becau&s;e he knows not which of the pa&s;&s;ions or de&s;ires is vitiated.</P>
<P>ADVICE, as it always gives a temporary appearance of &s;uperiority, can never be very grateful, even when it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary or mo&s;t judicious. But for the &s;ame rea&s;on every one is eager to in&s;truct his neighbours. To be wi&s;e or to be virtuous, is to buy dignity
<PB N="147" REF="148">
and importance at a high price; but when nothing is nece&s;&s;ary to elevation but detec|tion of the follies or the faults of others, no man is &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to the voice of fame as to linger on the ground. <Q><L>&mdash;Tentanda via e&s;t qua me quoque po&s;&s;im</L>
<L>Tollere humo, victorque vir&ucirc;m valitare per ora.</L></Q></P>
<P>VANITY is &s;o frequently the apparent motive of advice, that we, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ummon our powers to oppo&s;e it with|out any very accurate enquiry whether it is right. It is &s;ufficient that another is grow|ing great in his own eyes at our expence, and that he a&s;&s;umes an authority over us without our permi&s;&s;ion; for many would be content|ed to &s;uffer the con&s;equences of their own mi&s;takes, rather than the in&s;olence of him who triumphs as their deliverer.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, &s;eldom found that any ad|vantages are enjoyed with that moderation which the uncertainty of all human good &s;o powerfully enforces; and therefore the ad|vi&s;er may ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect, that he has inflamed
<PB N="148" REF="149">
the oppo&s;ition which he laments by arrogance and &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, though, indeed, he can rarely be certain, that the &s;ofte&s;t language or mo&s;t humble diffidence would have e&s;caped re&s;entment; for &s;carcely any degree of cir|cum&s;pection can prevent or obviate the rage with which the &s;lothful, the impotent, and the un&s;ucce&s;sful, vent their di&s;content upon tho&s;e that excel them, endeavour to eclip&s;e the beauties which they cannot out&s;hine, and to retard the &s;peed which they cannot over|take. Mode&s;ty it&s;elf, if it is prai&s;ed, will be envied; and there are minds &s;o impatient of inferiority, that their gratitude is a &s;pecies of revenge, and they return benefits, not be|cau&s;e recompence is a plea&s;ure, but becau&s;e obligation is a pain.</P>
<P>THE number of tho&s;e whom the love of them&s;elves has thus far corrupted, is perhaps not great; but there are few &s;o free from vanity as not to dictate to tho&s;e who will hear their in&s;tructions with a vi&s;ible &s;en&s;e of their own beneficence; and few to whom it is not un|plea&s;ing to receive documents, however ten|derly and cautiou&s;ly delivered, or who are
<PB N="149" REF="150">
not willing to rai&s;e them&s;elves from pupillage, by di&s;puting the propo&s;itions of their teacher.</P>
<P>IT was the maxim, I think, of <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> that <HI>dead coun&s;ellors are &s;afe&s;t.</HI> The grave puts an end to flattery and arti|fice, and the information that we receive from books is pure from intere&s;t, fear, or am|bition. Dead coun&s;ellors are likewi&s;e mo&s;t in&s;tructive; becau&s;e they are heard with pa|tience and with reverence. We are not un|willing to believe that man wi&s;er than our|&s;elves, from who&s;e abilities we may receive advantage, without any danger of rivalry or oppo&s;ition, and who affords us the light of his experience, without hurting our eyes by fla&s;hes of in&s;olence,</P>
<P>BY the con&s;ultation of books, whether of dead or living authors, many temptations to petulance and oppo&s;ition, which occur in oral conferences, are avoided. An author can|not obtrude his advice una&s;ked, nor can be often &s;u&s;pected of any malignant intention to in&s;ult his readers with his knowledge or his wit. Yet &s;o prevalent is the habit of com|paring
<PB N="150" REF="151">
our&s;elves with others, while they re|main within the reach of our pa&s;&s;ions, that books are &s;eldom read with complete impar|tiality, but by tho&s;e from whom the writer is placed at &s;uch a di&s;tance that his life or death is indifferent.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee that volumes may be peru&s;ed, and peru&s;ed with attention, to little effect; and that maxims of prudence, or principles of vir|tue, may be trea&s;ured in the memory without influencing the conduct. Of the numbers that pa&s;s their lives among books, very few read to be made wi&s;er or better, apply any ge|neral reproof of vice to them&s;elves, or try their own manners by axioms of ju&s;tice. They pur|po&s;e either to con&s;ume tho&s;e hours for which they can find no other amu&s;ement; to gain or pre&s;erve that re&s;pect which the learned have always obtained; or to gratify their curio&s;ity with knowledge, which, like trea&s;ure buried and forgotten, is of no u&s;e to others or them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>"THE preacher, (&s;ays a <HI>French</HI> author) may &s;pend an hour in explaining and en|forcing a precept of religion, without feel|ing
<PB N="151" REF="152">
any impre&s;&s;ion from his own perform|ance, becau&s;e he may have no further de|&s;ign than to fill up his hour." A &s;tudent may ea&s;ily exhau&s;t his life in comparing di|vines and morali&s;ts, without any practical regard to morality or religion; he may be learning not to live but to rea&s;on; he may regard only the elegance of &s;tile, ju&s;tne&s;s of argument, and accuracy of method; and may enable him&s;elf to critici&s;e with judgment, and di&s;pute with &s;ubtilty, while the chief u&s;e of his volumes is unthought of, his mind is unaf|fected, and his life is unreformed.</P>
<P>BUT though truth and virtue are thus frequently defeated by pride, ob&s;tinacy, or folly, we are not allowed to de&s;ert them, for whoever can furni&s;h arms which they have not hitherto employed, may enable them to gain &s;ome hearts which would have re&s;i&s;ted any other method of attack. Every man of genius has &s;ome arts of fixing the at|tention peculiar to him&s;elf, by which, hone&s;t|ly exerted, he may benefit mankind; for the arguments for purity of life fail of their due influence, not becau&s;e they have been con&s;i|dered and confuted, but becau&s;e they have
<PB N="152" REF="153">
been pa&s;&s;ed over without con&s;ideration. To the po&s;ition of <HI>Tully,</HI> that if Virtue could be &s;een &s;he mu&s;t be loved, may be added, that if Truth could be heard, &s;he mu&s;t be obeyed.</P>

<Q>"THERE is no reputation for genius, &s;ays <HI>Qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tillian,</HI> to be gained by writing on things, which, however nece&s;|&s;ary, have little &s;plendor or &s;hew. The height of a building attracts the eye, but the foundations lie without regard. Yet &s;ince there is not any way to the top of &s;cience, but from the lowe&s;t parts, I &s;hall think nothing unconnected with the art of oratory, which he that wants cannot be an orator"</Q>
<P><PB REF="154">
CONFIRMED and animated by this illu|&s;trious precedent, I &s;hall continue my inquiries into <HI>Milton</HI>'s art of ver&s;ification. Since, how|ever minute and trivial the employment may appear, of analy&s;ing lines into &s;yllables, and whatever ridicule may be incurred by a &s;o|lemn deliberation upon accents and pau&s;es, it is certain that without this petty knowledge no man can be a poet; and that from the pro|per di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ingle &s;ounds re&s;ults that harmony that adds force to rea&s;on, and gives grace to &s;ublimity; that &s;hackles attention, and governs pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THAT ver&s;e may be melodious and plea&s;|ing, it is nece&s;&s;ary, not only that the words be &s;o ranged as that the accent may fall on its proper place, but that the &s;yllables them&s;elves be &s;o cho&s;en as to flow &s;moothly into one an|other. This is to be effected by a propor|tionate mixture of vowels and con&s;onants, and by tempering the mute con&s;onants with liquids and &s;emivowels. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> grammarians have ob&s;erv'd, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to pronounce two con&s;onants without the intervention of a vowel, or without &s;ome emi&s;&s;ion of the breath between one and the other; this is longer and more perceptible, as the &s;ounds of the
<PB N="154" REF="155">
con&s;onants are le&s;s harmonically conjoined, and, by con&s;equence, the flow of the ver&s;e is longer interrupted.</P>
<P>IT is pronounced by <HI>Dryden,</HI> that a line of mono&s;yllables is almo&s;t always har&s;h. This, with regard to our language, is evi|dently true, not becau&s;e mono&s;yllables cannot compo&s;e harmony, but becau&s;e our mono&s;yl|lables being of <HI>Teutonic</HI> original, or formed by contraction, commonly begin and end with con&s;onants, as, <Q><L>&mdash;Every lower faculty</L>
<L><HI>Of &s;en&s;e, whereby they hear, &s;ee, &s;mell, touch, ta&s;te.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE difference of harmony ari&s;ing princi|pally from the collocation of vowels and con|&s;onants, will be &s;ufficiently conceived by at|tending to the following pa&s;&s;ages. <Q><L>Immortal <HI>Amarant</HI>&mdash;there grows</L>

<P><HI>MILTON,</HI> who&s;e ear had been accu|&s;tomed, not only to the mu&s;ick of the antient tongues, which, however vitiated by our pronunciation, excel all that are now in u&s;e, but to the &s;oftne&s;s of the <HI>Italian,</HI> the mo&s;t mellifluous of all modern poetry, &s;eems fully convinced of the unfitne&s;s of our language for &s;mooth ver&s;ification, and is therefore
<PB N="156" REF="157">
plea&s;ed with an opportunity of calling in a &s;ofter word to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for this rea&s;on, and I believe for this only, he &s;ometimes in|dulges him&s;elf in a long &s;eries of proper names, and introduces them where they add little but mu&s;ick to his poem. <Q><LG>

<P>HE has indeed, been more attentive to his &s;yllables than to his accents, and does not of|ten offend by colli&s;ions of con&s;onants, or openings of vowels upon each other, at lea&s;t not more often than other writers who have had le&s;s important or complicated &s;ubjects to take off their care ftom the cadence of their lines.</P>
<P>THE great peculiarity of <HI>Milton</HI>'s ver&s;ifi|cation, compared with that of later poets, is
<PB N="157" REF="158">
the eli&s;ion of one vowel before another, or the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t &s;yllable of a word ending with a vowel, when a vowel begins the following word. As <Q><L>Knowledge&mdash;</L>
<L>Oppre&s;&s;es el&s;e with &s;urfeit, and &s;oon turns</L>
<L>Wi&s;dom to folly, as nouri&s;hment to wind.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS licence, though now di&s;u&s;ed in <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> poetry, is yet allowed in many other languages antient and modern, and therefore the critics on <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> have, without much deliberation, commended <HI>Milton</HI> for continuing it. But one language cannot communicate its rules to another. We have already tried and rejected the hexameter of the antients, the double clo&s;e of the <HI>Italians,</HI> and the Alex|andrine of the <HI>French</HI>; and therefore the eli&s;ion of vowels, however graceful it may &s;eem to other nations, is not con&s;equently &s;uitable to the genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, rea&s;on to believe that we have negligently lo&s;t part of our vowels, and that the &s;ilent <HI>e</HI> which our ance&s;tors added to mo&s;t of our mono&s;yllables, was once vocal. By this detruncation of our &s;yllables, our
<PB N="158" REF="159">
language is over-&s;tocked with con&s;onants, and it is more nece&s;&s;ary to add vowels to the be|ginning of words, than to cut them off from the end.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI> therefore &s;eems to have &s;ome|what mi&s;taken the nature of our language, of which the chief defect is ruggedne&s;s and a&s;perity, and has left our har&s;h cadences yet har&s;her. But his eli&s;ions are not all equally to be cen&s;ured; in &s;ome &s;yllables they may be allowed, and perhaps in a few days may be &s;afely imitated. The ab&s;ci&s;ion of a vowel is undoubtedly vicious when it is &s;trongly &s;ounded, and makes, with its a&s;&s;ociate con&s;o|nant, a full and audible &s;yllable. <Q><LG>

<P>I BELIEVE every reader will agree that in all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, though not equally in all, the mu&s;ic is injured, and in &s;ome the meaning ob&s;cured. There are other lines in which the vowel is cut off, but it is &s;o faintly pronounced in common &s;peech, that the lo&s;s of it in poetry is &s;carcely perceived; and therefore &s;uch com|pliance with the mea&s;ure may be allowed. <Q><LG>

<P>THERE is nothing more fatal to a man who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to think, than to have learned the art of regaling his mind with tho&s;e airy gratifications. Other vices or follies are re|&s;trained by fear, reformed by admonition, or rejected by the conviction which the compa|ri&s;on of our conduct with that of others, may in time produce. But this invi&s;ible riot of the mind, this &s;ecret prodigality of being is &s;ecure from detection, and fearle&s;s of reproach. The dreamer retires to his apartments, &s;huts out the cares and interruptions of mankind, and abandons him&s;elf to his own fancy; new worlds ri&s;e up before him, one image is fol|lowed by another, and a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of delights dances round him. He is at la&s;t called back to life by nature, or by cu&s;tom, and enters peevi&s;h into &s;ociety, becau&s;e he
<PB N="164" REF="165">
cannot model it to his own will. He returns from his idle excur&s;ions with the a&s;perity, tho' not with the knowledge, of a &s;tudent, and ha&s;tens again to the &s;ame felicity with the eagerne&s;s of a man bent upon the advance|ment of &s;ome favourite &s;cience. The in&s;atu|ation &s;trengthens by degrees, and, like the poi&s;on of opiates, weakens his powers with|out any external &s;ymptom of malignity.</P>
<P>IT happens, indeed, that the&s;e hypocrites of learning are in time detected, and con|vinced by di&s;grace and di&s;appointment of the difference between the labour of thought, and the &s;port of mu&s;ing. But this di&s;covery is of|ten not made till it is too late to recover the time that has been fooled away. A thou|&s;and accidents may, indeed, awaken drones to a more early &s;en&s;e of their danger and their &s;hame. But they who are con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking from this habitual drow&s;ine&s;s, too often relap&s;e in &s;pite of their re&s;olution; for the&s;e ideal &s;educers are always near, and neither any particularity of time nor place is nece&s;&s;ary to their influ|ence; they invade the &s;oul without warning, and have often charmed down re&s;i&s;tance be|fore their approach is perceived or &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
THIS captivity, however, it is nece&s;&s;ary for every man to break, who has any de&s;ire to be wi&s;e or u&s;eful, to pa&s;s his life with the e&s;teem of others, or to look back with &s;atis|faction from his old age upon his earlier years. In order to regain liberty, he mu&s;t find the means of flying from him&s;elf; he mu&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Stoick</HI> precept, teach his de&s;ires to fix upon external things; he mu&s;t adopt the joys and the pains of others, and excite in his mind the want of &s;ocial plea&s;ures and amicable communi|cation.</P>
<P>IT is perhaps, not impo&s;&s;ible to promote the cure of this mental malady, by clo&s;e ap|plication to &s;ome new &s;tudy, which may pour in fre&s;h ideas, and keep curio&s;ity in per|petual motion. But &s;tudy requires &s;olitude, and &s;olitude is a &s;tate dangerous to tho&s;e who are too much accu&s;tomed to &s;ink into them&s;elves. Active employment, or publick plea&s;ure, is generally a nece&s;&s;ary part of this intellectual regimen, without which, though &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion may be ob|tained, a compleat cure will &s;carcely be effected.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
THIS is a formidable and ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;e of the intellect, of which, when it has once become radicated by time, the remedy is one of the harde&s;t ta&s;ks of rea&s;on and of virtue. Its &s;lighte&s;t attacks, therefore, &s;hould be watchfully oppo&s;ed; and he that finds the frigid and narcotick infection beginning to &s;eize him, &s;hould turn his whole attention again&s;t it, and check it at the fir&s;t di&s;covery by proper counteraction.</P>
<P>THE great re&s;olution to be formed, when happine&s;s and virtue are thus formidably in|vaded, is, that no part of life be &s;pent in a &s;tate of neutrality or indifference; but that &s;ome plea&s;ure be found for every moment that is not devoted to labour; and that, when|ever the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of life grows irk|&s;ome, or di&s;gu&s;ting, an immediate tran&s;ition be made to diver&s;ion and gaiety.</P>
<P>AFTER the exerci&s;es which the health of the body requires, and which have them&s;elves a natural tendency to actuate and invigorate the mind, the mo&s;t eligible amu&s;ement of a rational being &s;eems to be that interchange of thoughts which is practi&s;ed in free and
<PB N="167" REF="168">
ea&s;y conver&s;ation; where &s;u&s;picion is bani&s;h|ed by experience, and emulation by benevo|lence; where every man &s;peaks with no other re&s;traint than unwillingne&s;s to offend, and hears with no other di&s;po&s;ition than de&s;ire to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE mu&s;t be a time in which every man trifles; and the only choice that nature offers us, is, to trifle in company or alone. To join profit with plea&s;ure, has been an old precept among men who have had very dif|ferent conceptions of profit. All have agreed that our amu&s;ements &s;hould not terminate whol|ly in the pre&s;ent moment, but contribute more or le&s;s to future advantage. He that amu&s;es him&s;elf among well cho&s;en companions, can &s;carcely fail to receive, from the mo&s;t carele&s;s and ob&s;treperous merriment which virtue can allow &s;ome u&s;eful hints; nor can conver&s;e on the mo&s;t familiar topics, without &s;ome ca&s;ual information. The loo&s;e &s;parkles of thought|le&s;s wit may give new light to the mind, and the gay contention for paradoxical po&s;itions rectify the opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">
THIS is the time in which tho&s;e friend|&s;hips that give happine&s;s or con&s;olation, re|lief or &s;ecurity, are generally formed. A wi&s;e and good man is never &s;o amiable as in his unbended and familiar intervals. Heroic genero&s;ity, or philo&s;ophical di&s;coveries may compel veneration and re&s;pect, but love al|ways implies &s;ome kind of natural or volun|tary equality, and is only to be excited by that levity and chearfulne&s;s which di&s;encum|bers all minds from awe and &s;olicitude, invites the mode&s;t to freedom, and exalts the timo|rous to confidence. This ea&s;e and frankne&s;s is certain to plea&s;e, whatever be the character of him that exerts it; if our &s;uperiors de&s;cend from their elevation, we love them for le&s;&s;en|ing the di&s;tance at which we are placed below them; and inferiors, from whom we can re|ceive no la&s;ting advantage, will always keep our affections while their &s;prightline&s;s and mirth contributes to our plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>EVERY man finds him&s;elf differently af|fected by the &s;ight of fortre&s;&s;es of war, and palaces of plea&s;ure; we look on the height and &s;trength of the bulwarks with a kind of

gloomy &s;atisfaction, for we cannot think of defence without admitting images of danger; but we range delighted and jocund through the gay apartments of the palace, becau&s;e nothing is impre&s;&s;ed by them on the mind but joy and fe&s;tivity.

<P>IT is very difficult to write on the minuter parts of literature without failing either to plea&s;e or in&s;truct. Too much nicety of detail di&s;gu&s;ts the greate&s;t part of readers, and to throw a multitude of particulars under ge|neral heads, and lay down rules of exten&s;ive comprehen&s;ion, is to common under&s;tandings of little u&s;e. They who undertake the&s;e &s;ub|jects are therefore always in danger, as one or other inconvenience ari&s;es to their imagi|nation, of frighting us with rugged &s;cience, or amu&s;ing us with empty &s;ound.</P>
<P>IN critici&s;ing the work of <HI>Milton,</HI> there is, indeed, opportunity to inter&s;per&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that can hardly fail to relieve the langours of attention; and &s;ince, in examining the va|riety and choice of the pau&s;es with which he has diver&s;ified his numbers, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to exhibit the lines in which they are to be found, perhaps the remarks may be well
<PB N="171" REF="172">
compen&s;ated by the examples, and the irk|&s;omene&s;s of grammatical di&s;qui&s;itions &s;ome|what alleviated.</P>
<P>MILTON formed his &s;cheme of ver&s;ifica|tion by the poets of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> whom he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf for his models &s;o far as the difference of his language from theirs would permit the imitation. There are in|deed many inconveniencies in&s;eparable from our heroick mea&s;ure compared with that of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI>; inconveniencies, which, it is no reproach to <HI>Milton</HI> not to have overcome, becau&s;e they are in their own nature in&s;uperable; but again&s;t which he has &s;truggled with &s;o much art and diligence, that he may at lea&s;t be &s;aid to have de&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE hexameter of the ancients may be con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen &s;yllables, &s;o melodiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, that, as every one knows who has examined the poetical au|thors, very plea&s;ing and &s;onorous lyrick mea|&s;ures are formed from the fragments of the heroick. It is, indeed, &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to break them in &s;uch a manner but that <HI>in|venias</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="173">
<HI>etiam disjecti membra poetae,</HI> &s;ome har|mony will &s;till remain, and the due propor|tions of &s;ound will always be di&s;covered. This mea&s;ure therefore allowed great variety of pau&s;es, and great liberties of connecting one ver&s;e with another, becau&s;e wherever the line was interrupted, either part &s;ingly was mu&s;ical. But the ancients &s;eem to have con|fined this privilege to hexameters; for in their other mea&s;ures, though frequently longer than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> heroick, tho&s;e who wrote after the refinements of ver&s;ification venture &s;o &s;eldom to change their pau&s;es, that every variation may be &s;uppo&s;ed rather a compliance with nece&s;&s;ity than the choice of judgment.</P>
<P>MILTON, was con&s;trained within the nar|row limits of a mea&s;ure not very harmonious in the utmo&s;t perfection; the &s;ingle parts, therefore, into which it was to be &s;ometime; broken by pau&s;es, were in danger of lo&s;ing the very form of ver&s;e. This has, perhaps, notwith&s;tanding all his care, &s;ometimes hap|pened.</P>
<P>AS harmony is the end of poetical mea|&s;ures, no part of a ver&s;e ought to be &s;o &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t as not to remain &s;till
<PB N="173" REF="174">
more harmonious than pro&s;e, or to &s;hew, by the di&s;po&s;ition of the tones, that it is part of a ver&s;e. This rule in the old hexameter might be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, but in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will very frequently be in danger of violation; for the order and regularity of accents cannot well be perceived in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fewer than three &s;yllables, which will confine the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poet to only five pau&s;es; it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that, when he connects one line with another, he &s;hould never make a full pau&s;e at le&s;s di&s;tance than that of three &s;yl|lables from the beginning or end of a ver&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT this rule &s;hould be univer&s;ally and indi&s;pen&s;ably e&s;tabli&s;hed, perhaps cannot be granted; &s;omething may be allowed to variety, and &s;omething to the adaptation of the numbers to the &s;ubject; but it will be found generally nece&s;&s;ary, and the ear will &s;eldom fail to &s;uffer by its neglect.</P>
<P>THUS when a &s;ingle &s;yllable is cut off from the re&s;t, it mu&s;t either be united to the line with which the &s;en&s;e connects it, or be &s;ounded alone. If it be united to the other line, it corrupts its harmony; if disjoined,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
it mu&s;t, with regard to mu&s;ick, be &s;uper|fluous; for there is no harmony in a &s;ingle &s;ound, becau&s;e it has no proportion to an|other. <Q><L>Hypocrites au&s;terely talk</L>
<L>Defaming as impure what God declares</L>
<L><HI>Pure</HI>; and commands to &s;ome, leaves free to all.</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEN two &s;yllables likewi&s;e are ab&s;cind|ed from the re&s;t, they evidently want &s;ome a&s;&s;ociate &s;ounds to make them harmonious. <Q><LG>

<L>Shedding &s;weet influence.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ame defect is perceived in the fol|lowing lines where the pau&s;e is at the &s;e|cond &s;yllable from the beginning. <Q><L>The race</L>
<L>Of that wild rout that tore the <HI>Thracian</HI> bard</L>

<L>Both harp and voice; nor could the mu&s;e defend</L>
<L><HI>Her &s;on.</HI> So fail not thou, who thee implores.</L></Q></P>
<P>WHEN the pau&s;e falls upon the third &s;yl|lable or the &s;eventh, the harmony is better pre&s;erved, but as the third and &s;eventh are weak &s;yllables, the period leaves the ear un|&s;atisfied, and in expectation of the remaining part of the ver&s;e. <Q><PB N="176" REF="177"><LG>
<L>He, with his horrid crew,</L>
<L>Lay vanqui&s;h'd, rolling in the fiery gulph,</L>
<L>Confounded though immor<HI>tal.</HI> But his doom</L>
<L>Re&s;erv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>IT may be, I think, e&s;tabli&s;hed as a rule, that a pau&s;e which concludes a period &s;hould be made for the mo&s;t part upon a &s;trong &s;yllable, as the fourth and &s;ixth; but tho&s;e pau&s;es which only &s;u&s;pend the Sen&s;e may be placed upon the weaker. Thus the re&s;t in the third line of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age &s;atisfies the ear better than in the fourth, and the clo&s;e of the &s;econd quotation better than of the third. <Q><LG>

<P>THE re&s;t in the fifth place has the &s;ame inconvenience as in the &s;eventh and third, that the &s;yllable is weak. <Q><L>Bea&s;t now with bea&s;t 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,</L>

<P>THE noble&s;t and mo&s;t maje&s;tic pau&s;es which our ver&s;ification admits, are upon the fourth and &s;ixth &s;yllables, which are both &s;trongly &s;ounded in a pure and regular ver&s;e, and at either of which the line is &s;o divid|ed, that both members participate of har|mony. <Q><L>But now at la&s;t the &s;acred influence</L>

<P>THE SCIENCES having long &s;een their votaries labouring for the benefit of man|kind without reward, put up their petition to <HI>Jupiter</HI> for a more equitable di&s;tribution of riches and honours. <HI>Jupiter</HI> was moved at their complaints, and touched with the ap|proaching mi&s;eries of Men, whom the SCIEN|CES, wearied with perpetual ingratitude, were now threatening to for&s;ake, and who would have been reduced by their departure to feed in dens upon the ma&s;t of trees, to hunt their prey in de&s;arts, and to peri&s;h under the paws of animals &s;tronger and fiercer than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A SYNOD of the cele&s;tials was therefore convened, in which it was re&s;olved, that PA|TRONAGE &s;hould de&s;cend to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the SCIENCES. PATRONAGE was the Daughter of ASTREA, by a mortal father, and had been educated in the &s;chool of TRUTH, by the Godde&s;&s;es, whom &s;he was now appointed to protect. She had from her
<PB N="182" REF="183">
mother that dignity of a&s;pect, which &s;truck terror into fal&s;e merit, and from her mi&s;tre&s;s that re&s;erve, which made her only acce&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e whom the SCIENCES brought into her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>SHE came down, with the general acclama|tion of all the powers that favour learning. HOPE danced before her, and LIBERALI|TY &s;tood at her &s;ide, ready to &s;catter by her direction the gifts which FORTUNE, who fol|lowed her, was commanded to &s;upply. As &s;he advanced towards <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> the cloud which had long hung over it, was immediately di&s;pelled. The &s;hades, before withered with drought, &s;pread their original verdure, and the flowers that had langui&s;hed with chilne&s;s brightened their colours, and invigorated their &s;cents; the Mu&s;es tuned their harps and ex|erted their voices; and all the conceit of nature welcomed her arrival.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> &s;he fixed her re&s;idence, in a palace rai&s;ed by the SCIENCES, and adorned with whatever could delight the eye, elevate the imagination, or enlarge the under&s;tand|ing. Here &s;he di&s;per&s;ed the gifts of FOR|TUNE, with the impartiality of JUSTICE,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
and the di&s;cernment of TRUTH. Her gate &s;tood always open, and HOPE &s;at at the portal, inviting to entrance all whom the SCIENCES numbered in their train. The court was therefore thronged with innumera|ble multitudes, of whom, though many returned di&s;appointed, &s;eldom any had confidence to complain; for PATRONAGE was univer&s;ally known to neglect few, but for want of the due claims to her regard. Tho&s;e, therefore, who had &s;olicited her favour without &s;ucce&s;s, generally withdrew from publick notice, and either diverted their attention to meaner em|ployments, or endeavoured to &s;upply their deficiencies by clo&s;er application.</P>
<P>IN time, however, the number of tho&s;e who had mi&s;carried in their preten&s;ions grew &s;o great, that they became le&s;s a&s;hamed of their repul&s;es; and in&s;tead of hiding their di&s;grace in retirement, began to be|&s;iege the gates of the palace, and ob&s;truct the entrance of &s;uch as they thought likely to be more &s;ucce&s;sful. The deci&s;ions of PA|TRONAGE, who was but half a Godde&s;s, had been &s;ometimes erroneous; and though &s;he always made ha&s;te to rectify her mi&s;takes, a few in&s;tances of her fallibility encouraged
<PB N="184" REF="185">
every one to appeal from her judgment to his own and that of his companions, who were always ready to clamour in the common cau&s;e, and elate each other with reciprocal applau&s;e.</P>
<P>HOPE was a &s;teady friend to the di&s;ap|pointed, and IMPUDENCE incited them to accept a &s;econd invitation, and lay their claim again before PATRONAGE. They were again, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ent back with igno|miny, but found HOPE not alienated, and IMPUDENCE more re&s;olutely zealous; they therefore, contrived new expedients, and hoped at la&s;t to prevail by their multitudes which were always encrea&s;ing, and their per|&s;everance which HOPE and IMPUDENCE forbad them to relax.</P>
<P>PATRONAGE having been long a &s;tranger to the heavenly a&s;&s;emblies, began to degene|rate towards terre&s;trial nature, and forget the precepts of JUSTICE and TRUTH. In&s;tead of confining her friend&s;hip to the SCI|ENCES, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf, by little and lit|tle, to contract an acquaintance with PRIDE, the &s;on of FALSEHOOD, by who&s;e embraces &s;he had two daughters, FLATTERY and CAPRICE. FLATTERY was nur&s;ed by LI|BERALITY, and CAPRICE by FORTUNE,
<PB N="185" REF="186">
without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the le&s;&s;ons of the SCIENCES.</P>
<P>PATRONAGE began openly to adopt the &s;entiments and imitate the manners of her hu&s;band, by who&s;e opinion &s;he now directed her deci&s;ions with very little heed to the precepts of TRUTH; and, as her daughters continually gained upon her affections, the SCIENCES lo&s;t their influence, till none found much rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their reception, but tho&s;e whom CAPRICE or FLATTERY conducted to her throne.</P>
<P>THE throngs who had &s;o long waited, and &s;o often been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for want of recommen|dation from the SCIENCES, were delighted to &s;ee the power of tho&s;e rigorous Godde&s;&s;es, tending to its extinction. Their patrone&s;&s;es now renewed their encouragements. HOPE &s;miled at the approach of CAPRICE, and IMPUDENCE was always at hand to intro|duce her clients to FLATTERY.</P>
<P>PATRONAGE had now learned to pro|cure her&s;elf reverence by ceremonies and formalities, and in&s;tead of admitting her pe|titioners to an immediate audience, ordered

the antichamber to be erected, called among mortals, the <HI>Hall of Expectation.</HI> Into this hall the entrance was ea&s;y to tho&s;e whom IM|PUDENCE had con&s;igned to FLATTERY, and it was therefore crouded with a promi&s;|cuous throng, a&s;&s;embled from every corner of the earth, pre&s;&s;ing forward with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s of de&s;ire, and agitated with all the anxieties of competition.</P>
<P>THEY entered this general receptacle with ardour and alacrity, and made no doubt of &s;peedy acce&s;s under the conduct of FLAT|TERY to the pre&s;ence of PATRONAGE. But it generally happened that they were here left to their de&s;tiny, for the inner doors were committed to CAPRICE, who opened and &s;hut them, as it &s;eemed, by chance, and rejected or admitted without any &s;ettled rule of di&s;tinction. In the mean time, the mi&s;e|rable attendants, were left to wear out their lives in alternate exultation and dejection, delivered up to the &s;port of SUSPICION who was always whi&s;pering into their ear de&s;igns again&s;t them which were never formed, and of ENVY who diligently pointed out the good fortune of one or other of their competitors.
<PB N="187" REF="190">
INFAMY flew round the hall, and &s;cat|tered mildews from her wings, with which every one was &s;tained; REFUTATION fol|lowed her with &s;lower flight, and endea|voured to hide the blemi&s;hes with paint, which was immediately bru&s;hed away, or &s;eparated of it&s;elf, and left the &s;tains more vi&s;ible; nor were the &s;pots of INFAMY ever effaced, but with limpid water effu&s;ed by the hand of TIME from the well of TRUTH.</P>
<P>IT frequently happened that SCIENCE, unwilling to lo&s;e the antient prerogative of recommending to PATRONAGE, would lead her followers into the <HI>Hall of Expecta|tion</HI>; but they were &s;oon di&s;couraged from attending, for not only ENVY and SUS|PICION ince&s;&s;antly tormented them, but IM|PUDENCE con&s;idered them as intruders, and incited INFAMY to blacken them. They therefore quickly retired, but &s;eldom without &s;ome &s;pots which they could never wa&s;h away, and which &s;hewed that they had once waited in the <HI>Hall of Expectation.</HI></P>
<P>THE re&s;t continued to expect the happy moment, at which CAPRICE &s;hould beckon them to approach; and endeavoured to pro|pitiate

her not with <HI>Homerical</HI> harmony, the repre&s;entation of great actions, or the recital of noble &s;entiments, but with &s;oft and volup|tuous melody, intermingled with the prai&s;es of PATRONAGE and PRIDE, by whom they were heard at once with plea&s;ure and contempt.</P>
<P>SOME were indeed admitted by CAPRICE, when they lea&s;t expected it, and heaped by PATRONAGE with the gifts of FORTUNE, but they were from that time chained to her foot-&s;tool, end condemned to regulate their lives by her glances and her nods; they &s;eemed proud of their manacles, and &s;eldom com|plained of any drudgery, however &s;ervile, or any affront, however contemptuous; yet they were often, notwith&s;tanding their obedience, &s;eized on a &s;udden by CAPRICE, dive&s;ted of their ornaments, and thru&s;t back into the <HI>Hall of Expectation.</HI></P>
<P>HERE they mingled again with the tumult, and all, except a few whom experience had taught to &s;eek happine&s;s in the regions of li|berty, continued to &s;pend hours, and days, and years, courting the &s;mile of CAPRICE with the arts of FLATTERY; till at length

new crouds pre&s;&s;ed in upon them, and drove them forth at different outlets into the habita|tions of DISEASE, and SHAME, and PO|VERTY, and DESPAIR, where they pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of their lives in narratives of promi&s;es and breaches of faith, of joys and &s;orrows, of hopes and di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>THE SCIENCES, after a thou&s;and indigni|ties, retired from the palace of PATRONAGE, and having long wandered over the world in grief and di&s;tre&s;s, were led at la&s;t to the cot|tage of INDEPENDANCE, the daughter of FORTITUDE; where they were taught by PRUDENCE and PARSIMONY to &s;upport them&s;elves in dignity and quiet.</P>

<P>IT has been long ob&s;erved that the idea of beauty is vague and undefined, different in different minds, and diver&s;ified by time or place. It has been a term hitherto u&s;ed to &s;ignify that which plea&s;es us we know not why, and in our approbation of which we can ju&s;tify our&s;elves only by the concurrence of numbers, without much power of enforc|ing our opinion upon others by any argu|ment, but example and authority. It is, in|deed, &s;o little &s;ubject to the examinations of rea&s;on, that <HI>Pa&s;chal</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it to end where demon&s;tration begins, and maintains that without incongruity and ab&s;urdity we cannot &s;peak of <HI>geometrical beauty</HI></P>
<P>TO trace all the &s;ources of that various plea&s;ure which we a&s;cribe to the agency of beauty, or to di&s;entangle all the perceptions involved in its idea, would, perhaps, require
<PB N="191" REF="194">
a very great part of the life of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> or <HI>Plato.</HI> It is, however, in many ca&s;es, ap|parent that this quality is merely relative and comparative; that we pronounce things beau|tiful, becau&s;e they have &s;omething which we agree, for whatever rea&s;on, to call beauty, in a greater degree than we have been accu&s;|tomed to find it in other things of the &s;ame kind; and that we transfer the epithet as our knowledge encrea&s;es, and appropriate it to higher excellence, when higher excellence comes within our view.</P>
<P>MUCH of the beauty of writing is of this kind; and therefore <HI>Boileau</HI> ju&s;tly remarks, that the books which have &s;tood the te&s;t of time, and been admired through all the changes which the mind of man has &s;uffered from the various revolutions of knowledge, and the prevalence of contrary cu&s;toms, have a better claim to our regard than any modern can boa&s;t, becau&s;e the long continuance of their reputation proves that they are adequate to our faculties, and agreeable to nature.</P>
<P>IT is, however, the ta&s;k of critici&s;m to e&s;tabli&s;h principles; to improve opinion into
<PB N="192" REF="195">
knowledge; and to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e means of plea&s;ing which depend upon known cau&s;es and rational deduction, from the namele&s;s and inexplicable elegancies which appeal wholly to the fancy, from which we feel delight but know not how they produce it, and which may well be termed the enchan|tre&s;&s;es of the &s;oul. Critici&s;m reduces tho&s;e regions of literature under the dominion of &s;cience, which have hitherto known only the anarchy of ignorance, the caprices of fancy, and the tyranny of pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in the art of ver&s;ifying &s;o much expo&s;ed to the power of imagination as the accommodation of the &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e, or the repre&s;entation of particular images, by the flow of the ver&s;e in which they are expre&s;&s;ed. Every &s;tudent has innu|merable pa&s;&s;ages, in which he, and perhaps he alone, di&s;covers &s;uch re&s;emblances; and &s;ince the attention of the pre&s;ent race of poetical readers &s;eems particularly turned up|on this &s;pecies of elegance, I &s;hall endeavour to examine how much the&s;e in conformity have been ob&s;erved by the poets, or directed by the criticks, how far they can be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon
<PB N="193" REF="196">
nature and rea&s;on, and on what occa&s;ions they have been practi&s;ed by <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOMER,</HI> the father of all poetical beauty, has been particularly celebrated by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us,</HI> as <HI>he that, of all the poets, exhi|bited the greate&s;t variety of &s;ound; for there are,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>innumerable pa&s;&s;ages, in which length of time, bulk of body, extremity of pa&s;|&s;ion, and &s;tillne&s;s of repo&s;e; or, in which, on the contrary, brevity, &s;peed, and eagerne&s;s, are evidently marked out by the &s;ound of the &s;yllables. Thus the angui&s;h and &s;low pace with which the blind</HI> Polypheme <HI>groped out with his hands the entrance of his cave, are perceived in the ca|dence of the ver&s;es which de&s;cribe it.</HI> <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>THUS the efforts of <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;truggling in his armour again&s;t the current of a river, &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ting and &s;ometimes yielding, may be perceived in the eli&s;ions of the &s;ylla|bles, the &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the feet, and the &s;trength of the con&s;onants. <Q><PB N="194" REF="197"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 lines"></Q></P>
<P>WHEN he de&s;cribes the cru&s;h of men da&s;hed again&s;t a rock, he collects the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing and har&s;h &s;ounds. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>And when he would place before the eyes &s;omething dreadful and a&s;toni&s;hing, he makes choice of the &s;tronge&s;t vowels, and the letters of mo&s;t difficult utterance. <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>MANY other examples <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> produces, but the&s;e will &s;ufficiently &s;hew that either he was fanciful, or we have lo&s;t the genuine pro|nunciation; for I know not whether in any one of the&s;e in&s;tances &s;uch &s;imilitude can be di&s;covered. It &s;eems, indeed, probable, that the veneration with which <HI>Homer</HI> was read, produced many &s;uppo&s;itious beauties; for though it is certain, that the &s;ound of many of his ver&s;es very ju&s;tly corre&s;ponds with the
<PB N="195" REF="198">
things expre&s;&s;ed, yet when the force of his imagination, which gave him full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every object, is con&s;idered together with the flexibility of his language, of which the &s;yl|lables might be often contracted or dilated at plea&s;ure, it will &s;eem unlikely that &s;uch con|formity &s;hould happen le&s;s frequently even without de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IT is not however to be doubted, that <HI>Virgil</HI> who wrote amid&s;t the light of critici&s;m, and who owed &s;o much of his &s;ucce&s;s to art and labour, endeavoured among other excel|lencies to exhibit this &s;imilitude; nor has he been le&s;s happy in this than in the other graces of ver&s;ification. This felicity of his numbers was at the revival of learning di&s;played with great elegance by <HI>Vida</HI> in his art of poetry. <Q><L>Haud &s;atis e&s;t illis utcunque claudere ver&s;um.&mdash;</L>

<PB N="200" REF="203">
mo&s;t diligent endeavours after this imagery of &s;ound. The ver&s;e intended to repre&s;ent the whi&s;per of the vernal breeze, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed not much to excel in &s;oftne&s;s or volubility; and the &s;mooth &s;tream, runs with a perpetual cla&s;h of jarring con&s;onants.

The &s;wiftne&s;s of <HI>Camilla</HI> is rather contra&s;ted than exemplified; why the ver&s;e &s;hould be lengthened to expre&s;s &s;peed, will not ea&s;ily be di&s;covered. In the dactyls u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e by the ancients, two &s;hort &s;yl|lables were pronounced with &s;uch rapidity, as to be equal only to one long; they, therefore, naturally exhibit the act of pa&s;&s;ing through a long &s;pace in a &s;hort time.

<P>THERE are few books on which more time is &s;pent by young &s;tudents, than on treati&s;es which deliver the characters of au|thors; nor any which oftener deceive the ex|pectation of the reader, or fill his mind with more opinions which the progre&s;s of his &s;tudies and the encrea&s;e of his knowledge oblige him to re&s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>BAILLET</HI> has introduced his collec|tion of the deci&s;ions of the learned, by an enumeration of the prejudices which mi&s;lead the critick, and rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions in rebellion again&s;t the judgment. His catalogue, though large, is imperfect; and who can hope to complete it? The beauties of writing have been ob&s;erved to be often &s;uch as cannot in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human knowledge be evinced by evidence, or drawn out into demon|&s;trations; they are therefore wholly &s;ubject to the imagination, and do not force their ef|fects
<PB N="203" REF="206">
upon a mind preoccupied by unfavour|able &s;entiments, nor overcome the counter|action of a fal&s;e principle or of &s;tubborn par|tiality.</P>
<P>TO convince any man again&s;t his will is hard, but to plea&s;e him again&s;t his will is ju&s;tly pronounced by <HI>Dryden</HI> to be above the reach of human abilities. Intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion will hold out long again&s;t the clo&s;e&s;t &s;iege of diagrams and &s;yllogi&s;ms, but they are ab&s;o|lutely impregnable to imagery and &s;entiment; and will for ever bid defiance to the mo&s;t powerful &s;trains of <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Homer,</HI> though they may give way in time to the batteries of <HI>Euclid</HI> or <HI>Archimedes.</HI></P>
<P>IN tru&s;ting therefore to the &s;entence of a critick, we are in danger not only from that vanity which exalts writers too often to the dignity of teaching what they are yet to learn, from that negligence which &s;ometimes &s;teals upon the mo&s;t vigilant caution, and that fal|libility to which the condition of nature has &s;ubjected every human under&s;tanding; but from a thou&s;and extrin&s;ick and accidental cau&s;es, from every thing which can excite kindne&s;s or malevolence, veneration or con|tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207">
MANY of tho&s;e who have determined with great boldne&s;s, upon the various degrees of literary merit, may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence, as <HI>Seneca</HI> remarks of <HI>Claudius,</HI> <Q><L>Una tantum Parte audita,</L>
<L>Saepe et nulla,</L></Q> without much knowledge of the cau&s;e before them; for it will not ea&s;ily be imagined of <HI>Langbaine, Borrichitus</HI> or <HI>Rapin,</HI> that they had very accurately peru&s;ed all the books which they prai&s;e or cen&s;ure; or that, even if nature and learning had qualified them for judges, they could read for ever with the at|tention nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;t critici&s;m. Such per|formances, however, are not wholly without their u&s;e; for they are commonly ju&s;t echoes to the voice of fame, and tran&s;mit the general &s;uffrage of mankind when they have no par|ticular motives to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>CRITICKS, like all the re&s;t of mankind, are very frequently mi&s;led by intere&s;t. The bigotry with which editors regard the authors whom they illu&s;trate or correct, has been generally remarked. <HI>Dryden</HI> was known to have writ|ten
<PB N="205" REF="208">
mo&s;t of his critical di&s;&s;ertations only to recommend the works, upon which he then happened to be employed; and <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> is &s;u&s;pected to have denied the expediency of poetical ju&s;tice, becau&s;e his own <HI>Cata</HI> was condemned to peri&s;h in a good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are prejudices which authors, not otherwi&s;e weak or corrupt, have indulged without &s;cruple; and perhaps &s;ome of them are &s;o complicated with our natural affections, that they cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;intangled from the heart. Scarce any can hear with impar|tiality a compari&s;on between the writers of his own and another country; and though it cannot, I think, be charged equally on all nations, that they are blinded with this li|terary patrioti&s;m, yet there are none that do not look upon their authors with the fondne&s;s of affinity, and e&s;teem them as well for the place of their birth, as for their know|ledge or their wit. There is, therefore, &s;el|dom much re&s;pect due to comparative criti|ci&s;m, when the competitors are of different countries, unle&s;s the judge is of a nation equally indifferent to both. The <HI>Italians</HI> could not for a long time believe, that there was any learning beyond the mountains; and
<PB N="206" REF="209">
the <HI>French</HI> &s;eem generally per&s;uaded, that there are no wits or rea&s;oners equal to their own. I can &s;carcely believe that if <HI>Scaliger</HI> had not con&s;idered him&s;elf as allied to <HI>Virgil,</HI> by being born in the &s;ame country, he would have found his works &s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of <HI>Homer,</HI> or have thought the contro|ver&s;y worthy of &s;o much zeal, vehemence, and acrimony.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, one prejudice, and only one, by which it may be doubted whe|ther it is any di&s;honour to be &s;ometimes mi&s;|guided. Critici&s;m has &s;o often given occa|&s;ion to the envious and ill-natured of gratify|ing their malignity, that &s;ome have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to recommend the virtue of can|dour without limits or re&s;triction, and to pre|clude all future ages from the liberty of cen|&s;ure. Writers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this opinion are continually enforcing the duties of civility and decency, recommending to criticks the proper diffidence of them&s;elves, and inculcat|ing the veneration due to celebrated names.</P>
<P>I AM not of opinion that the&s;e profe&s;&s;ed enemies of arrogance and &s;everity, have much
<PB N="207" REF="210">
more benevolence or mode&s;ty than the re&s;t of mankind; or that they feel in their own hearts, any other intention than to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy. Some are mode&s;t becau&s;e they are timorous, and &s;ome are lavi&s;h of prai&s;e becau&s;e they hope to be repaid.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed &s;ome tenderne&s;s due to living writers, when they attack none of tho&s;e truths which are of importance to the happi|ne&s;s of mankind, and have committed no other offence than that of betraying their own igno|rance or dulne&s;s. I &s;hould think it cruelty to cru&s;h an in&s;ect who had provoked me only by buzzing in my ear; and would not willingly interrupt the dream of harmle&s;s &s;tupidity, or de&s;troy the je&s;t which makes its author laugh. Yet I am far from thinking this tenderne&s;s univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary; for he that writes may be con&s;idered as a kind of general challenger, whom every one has a right to attack; &s;ince he quits the common rank of life, &s;teps for|ward beyond the li&s;ts, and offers his merit to the publick judgment. To commence au|thor is to claim prai&s;e, and no man can ju&s;tly
<PB N="208" REF="211">
a&s;pire to honour, but at the hazard of di&s;|grace.</P>
<P>BUT whatever be decided concerning con|temporaries, whom he that knows the trea|chery of the human heart, and con&s;iders how often we gratify our own pride or envy under the appearance of contending for elegance and propriety, will find him&s;elf not much in|clined to di&s;turb; there can &s;urely be no ex|emptions pleaded to &s;ecure them from criti|ci&s;m, who can no longer &s;uffer by reproach, and of whom nothing now remains but their writings and their names. Upon the&s;e au|thors the critick is, undoubtedly, at full li|berty to exerci&s;e the &s;tricte&s;t &s;everity, &s;ince he endangers only his own fame, and, like <HI>Aeneas</HI> when he drew his &s;word in the infernal re|gions, encounters phantoms which cannot be wounded. He may indeed pay &s;ome regard to e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation; but he can by that &s;hew of reverence con&s;ult only his own &s;ecu|rity, for all other motives are now at an end.</P>
<P>THE faults of a writer of acknowledged excellence are more dangerous, becau&s;e the influence of his example is more exten&s;ive;
<PB N="209" REF="212">
and the intere&s;t of learning requires that they &s;hould be di&s;covered and &s;tigmatized, before they have the &s;anction of antiquity conferred upon them, and become precedents of indi&s;|putable authority.</P>
<P>IT has, indeed, been advanced by <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> as one of the characteri&s;ticks of a true critick, that he points out beauties rather than faults. But it is rather natural to a man of learning and genius, to apply him&s;elf chiefly to the &s;tudy of writers who have more beauties than faults to be di&s;played; for the duty of criti|ci&s;m is neither to depreciate, nor dignify by partial repre&s;entations; but to hold out the light of rea&s;on, whatever it may di&s;cover; and to promulgate the determinations of truth, whatever &s;he &s;hall dictate.</P>

<P>THE re&s;emblance of poetick numbers to the &s;ubject which they mention or de&s;cribe, may be con&s;idered as general or par|ticular; as con&s;i&s;ting in the flow and &s;tructure of a whole pa&s;&s;age taken together, or as com|pri&s;ed in the &s;ound of &s;ome emphatical and de|&s;criptive words, or in the cadence and harmo|ny of &s;ingle ver&s;es.</P>
<P>THE general re&s;emblance of the &s;ound to the &s;en&s;e is to be found in every language which admits of poetry, in every author who&s;e force of fancy enables him to impre&s;s images &s;trongly on his own mind, and who&s;e choice and variety of language readily &s;up|plies him with ju&s;t repre&s;entations. To &s;uch a writer it is natural to change his mea&s;ures with his &s;ubject, even without any effort of
<PB N="211" REF="214">
the under&s;tanding, or intervention of the judgment. To revolve jollity and mirth ne|ce&s;&s;arily tunes the voice of a poet to gay and &s;prightly notes, as it fires his eye with vi|vacity; and reflection on gloomy &s;ituations and di&s;a&s;trous events, will &s;adden his num|bers, as it will cloud his countenance. But in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages there is only the &s;imilitude of plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure, and of grief to grief, without any immediate application to parti|cular images. The &s;ame flow of joyous ver|&s;ification will celebrate the jollity of marriage, and the exultation of triumph; and the &s;ame languor of melody will &s;uit the complaints of an ab&s;ent lover, as of a conquered king.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely to be doubted, that on many occa&s;ions we make the mu&s;ick which we ima|gine our&s;elves to hear; that we modulate the poem by our own di&s;po&s;ition, and a|&s;cribe to the numbers the effects of the &s;en&s;e. We may ob&s;erve in life, that it is not ea&s;y to deliver a plea&s;ing me&s;&s;age in an un|plea&s;ing manner, and that we readily a&s;&s;o|ciate beauty and deformity with tho&s;e whom for any rea&s;on we love or hate. Yet it would be too daring to declare that all the celebrat|ed
<PB N="212" REF="215">
adaptations of harmony are chimerical; that <HI>Homer</HI> had no extraordinary attention to the melody of his ver&s;e when he de&s;cribed a nuptial fe&s;tivity; <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q> that <HI>Vida</HI> was merely fanciful, when he &s;up|po&s;ed <HI>Virgil</HI> endeavouring to repre&s;ent by un|common &s;weetne&s;s of numbers the adventi|tious beauty of <HI>Aeneas</HI>; <Q><L>Os, humero&s;que Deo &s;imilis: namque ip&s;a decoram</L>

<P><PB N="213" REF="216">
THAT <HI>Milton</HI> under&s;tood the force of &s;ounds well adju&s;ted, and knew the compa&s;s and variety of the ancient mea&s;ures, cannot be doubted, &s;ince he was both a mu&s;ician and a critick; but he &s;eems to have con&s;idered the&s;e conformities of cadence, as either not often attainable in our language, or as petty excellencies unworthy of his ambition; for it will not be found that he has always a&s;|&s;igned the &s;ame ca&s;t of numbers to the &s;ame &s;ubjects. He has given in two pa&s;&s;ages very minute de&s;criptions of angelick beauty; but though the images are nearly the &s;ame, the numbers will be found upon compari&s;on very different. <Q><L>And now a &s;tripling cherub he appears,</L>

Some of the lines of this de&s;cription are re|markably defective in harmony, and therefore by no means corre&s;pondent with that &s;ym|metrical elegance and ea&s;y grace which they are intended to exhibit.

THE adumbration of particular and di&s;tinct images by an exact and perceptible re&s;em|blance of &s;ound, is &s;ometimes &s;tudied, and &s;ometimes ca&s;ual. Every language has many words formed in imitation of the noi&s;es which they &s;ignify. Such are <HI>Stridor, Balo,</HI> and <HI>Boatus,</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI>; and in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to <HI>growl,</HI> to <HI>buzz,</HI> to <HI>hi&s;s,</HI> and to <HI>jarr.</HI> Words of this kind give to a ver&s;e the proper &s;imi|litude of &s;ound without much labour of the writer, and &s;uch happine&s;s is therefore to be attributed rather to fortune than &s;kill; yet they are &s;ometimes combined with great pro|priety, and undeniably contribute to enforce the impre&s;&s;ion of the idea. We hear the pa&s;&s;ing arrow in this line of <HI>Virgil</HI>; <Q>Et fugit <HI>horrendum &s;tridens</HI> elap&s;a &s;agitta;</Q> and the creaking of hell gates, in the de|&s;cription by <HI>Milton</HI>; <Q><L>Open fly</L>

<L>Th' infernal doors; and on their hinges grate</L>
<L>Har&s;h thunder.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="219">
BUT many beauties of this kind, which the moderns, and perhaps the ancients have ob&s;erved, &s;eem to be the product of blind reverence acting upon fancy. <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> him|&s;elf tells us, that the &s;ound of <HI>Homer</HI>'s ver&s;es &s;ometimes exhibits the idea of corporeal bulk: is not this a di&s;covery nearly approaching to that of the blind man, who after long en|quiry into the nature of the &s;carlet colour, found that it repre&s;ented nothing &s;o much as the clangor of a trumpet? the repre&s;entative power of poetick harmony con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ound and mea&s;ure; of the force of the &s;yllables &s;ingly con&s;idered, and of the time in which they are pronounced. Sound can re&s;emble nothing but &s;ound, and time can mea&s;ure no|thing but motion and duration.</P>
<P>THE criticks, however, have &s;truck out other &s;imilitudes; nor is there any irregu|larity of numbers which credulous admira|tion cannot di&s;cover to be eminently beautiful. Thus the propriety of each of the&s;e lines has been celebrated by writers who&s;e opinion the world has rea&s;on to regard, <Q><L>Vertitur interea coelum, &amp; ruit oceano nox.&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="220">
Sternitur, exanimi&s;que tremens procumbit humi bos.&mdash;</L>
<L>Parturiunt, montes, na&s;cetur ridiculus mus.&mdash;</L></Q> If all the&s;e ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, there mu&s;t be &s;ome remarkable conformity between the &s;ud|den &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of night to day, the fall of an ox under a blow, and the birth of a mou&s;e from a mountain; &s;ince we are told of all the&s;e images, that they are very &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame form and termination of the ver&s;e.</P>
<P>WE may, however, without giving way to enthu&s;ia&s;m, admit that &s;ome beauties of this kind may be produced. A &s;udden &s;top at an unu&s;ual &s;yllable may image the ce&s;&s;ation of action, or the pau&s;e of di&s;cour&s;e; and <HI>Milton</HI> has very happily imitated the repeti|tions of an echo, <Q><L>I fled, and cried out <HI>death</HI>;</L>
<L>Hell trembled at the hideous name, and &s;igh'd</L>
<L>From all her caves, and back re&s;ounded <HI>death.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="221">
THE mea&s;ure or time of pronouncing may be varied &s;o as very &s;trongly to repre|&s;ent, not only the modes of external motion, but the quick or &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind. This at lea&s;t was the power of the &s;pondaick and dactylick harmony, but our language can reach no eminent diver&s;ities of &s;ound. We can indeed &s;ometimes, by encumbering and retarding the line, &s;hew the difficulty of a progre&s;s made by &s;trong efforts and with frequent interruptions, or mark a &s;low and heavy motion. Thus <HI>Milton</HI> has imaged the toil of <HI>Satan</HI> &s;truggling through chaos, <Q><L>So he with difficulty and labour hard</L>
<L>Mov'd on: with difficulty and labour he&mdash;</L></Q> thus he has de&s;cribed the leviathans or whales. <Q>Wallowing, unweildy, enormous in their gait.</Q> But he has at other times neglected &s;uch re|pre&s;entations, as may be ob&s;erved in the vo|lubility and levity of the&s;e lines, which ex|pre&s;s an action tardy and reluctant. <Q><PB N="219" REF="222"><L>De&s;cent and fall</L>
<L>To us is adver&s;e. Who but felt of late,</L>
<L>When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear</L>
<L>In&s;ulting, and pur&s;u'd us through the deep,</L>
<L>With what confu&s;ion and laborious flight</L>
<L>We &s;unk thus low? Th' a&s;cent is ea&s;y then.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN another place, he de&s;cribes the gentle glide of ebbing waters in a line remarkably rough and halting. <Q><L>Tripping ebb; that &s;tole</L>
<L>With &s;oft foot tow'rds the deep who now had &s;topp'd</L>
<L>His &s;luices.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is not indeed to be expected, that the &s;ound &s;hould always a&s;&s;i&s;t the meaning, but it ought never to counteract it; and therefore <HI>Milton</HI> has here certainly committed a fault like that of the player, who looked on the earth when he implored the heavens, and to the heavens when he addre&s;&s;ed the earth.</P>
<P>THOSE who are determined to find in <HI>Milton</HI> an a&s;&s;emblage of all the excellencies
<PB N="220" REF="223">
which have enobled all other poets, will perhaps be offended that I do not celebrate his ver&s;ification in higher terms; for there are readers who di&s;cover that in this pa&s;&s;age, <Q>So &s;tretch'd out huge in length the arch|fiend lay,</Q> a <HI>long</HI> form is de&s;cribed in a <HI>long</HI> line; but the truth is, that length of body is only men|tioned in a <HI>&s;low</HI> line, to which it has only the re&s;emblance of time to &s;pace, of an hour to a maypole.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame turn of ingenuity might per|form wonders upon the de&s;cription of the ark; <Q><L>Then from the mountains hewing tim|ber tall</L>
<L>Began to build a ve&s;&s;el of huge bulk;</L>
<L>Mea&s;ur'd by cubit, length, breadth, and height.</L></Q> In the&s;e lines the poet apparently de&s;igns to fix the attention upon bulk; but this is effect|ed by the enumeration, not by the mea&s;ure; for what analogy can there be between modu|lations of &s;ound, and corporeal dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="224">
MILTON, indeed, &s;eems only to have re|garded this &s;pecies of embelli&s;hment &s;o far as not to reject it when it came un&s;ought; which would often happen to a mind &s;o vigo|rous, employed upon a &s;ubject &s;o various and exten&s;ive. He had, indeed, a greater and a nobler work to perform; a &s;ingle &s;entiment of moral or religious truth, a &s;ingle image of life or nature, would have been cheaply lo&s;t for a thou&s;and echoes of the cadence to the &s;en&s;e; and he who had undertaken to <HI>vindi|cate the ways of God to man,</HI> might have been accu&s;ed of neglecting his cau&s;e, had he lavi&s;h|ed much of his attention upon &s;yllables and &s;ounds.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many di&s;ea&s;es both of the body and mind, which it is far ea&s;ier to prevent than to cure, and therefore I hope you will think me employed in an office not u&s;ele&s;s either to learning or virtue, if I de&s;cribe the &s;ymptoms of an intellectual malady, which, though at fir&s;t it &s;eizes only the pa&s;|&s;ions, will, if not &s;peedily remedied, infect the rea&s;on, and, from bla&s;ting the blo&s;&s;oms of knowledge, proceed in time to canker the root.</P>
<P>I WAS born in the hou&s;e of di&s;cord. My parents were of un&s;uitable ages, con|rary
<PB N="223" REF="226">
tempers, and different religions, and therefore employed the &s;pirit and acutene&s;s which nature had very liberally be&s;towed upon both, in hourly di&s;putes, and ince&s;&s;ant con|trivances to detect each other in the wrong; &s;o that from the fir&s;t exertions of rea&s;on I was bred a di&s;putant, trained up in all the arts of dome&s;tick &s;ophi&s;try, initiated in a thou|&s;and low &s;tratagems, nimble &s;hifts, and &s;ly concealments; ver&s;ed in all the turns of al|tercation, and acquainted with the whole di|&s;cipline of <HI>fending</HI> and <HI>proving.</HI></P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;arily my care to pre&s;erve the kindne&s;s of both the controverti&s;ts, and there|fore I had very early formed the habit of &s;u|&s;pending my judgment, of hearing arguments with indifference, inclining as occa&s;ion re|quired to either &s;ide, and of holding my&s;elf undetermined between them till I knew for what opinion I might conveniently declare.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I acquired very early the &s;kill of di&s;putation, and, as we naturally love the arts in which we believe our&s;elves to excel, I did not let my abilities lie u&s;ele&s;s, nor &s;uffer my dexterity to be lo&s;t for want of practice.
<PB N="224" REF="227">
I engaged in perpetual wrangles with my &s;chool-fellows, and was never to be convinced or repre&s;&s;ed by any other arguments than blows, by which my antagoni&s;ts commonly determined the controver&s;y, as I was, like the <HI>Roman</HI> orator, much more eminent for elo|quence than courage.</P>
<P>AT the univer&s;ity I found my predominant ambition completely gratified by the &s;tudy of logick. I empre&s;&s;ed upon my memory a thou&s;and axioms, and ten thou&s;and di&s;tinc|tions, practi&s;ed every form of &s;yllogi&s;m, pa&s;&s;ed all my Days in the &s;chools of di&s;putation, and &s;lept every night with <HI>Smiglecius</HI> on my pillow.</P>
<P>YOU will not doubt but &s;uch a genius was &s;oon rai&s;ed to eminence by &s;uch applica|tion: I was celebrated in my third year for the mo&s;t artful opponent that the univer&s;ity could boa&s;t, and became the terror and the envy of all the candidates for philo&s;ophical re|putation.</P>
<P>MY renown, indeed, was not purcha&s;ed but at the price of all my time and all my

&s;tudies. I never &s;poke but to contradict, nor declaimed but in defence of a po&s;ition univer&s;ally acknowledged to be fal&s;e, and therefore worthy, in my opinion, to be|adorned with all the colours of fal&s;e repre|&s;entation, and &s;trengthened with all the arts of fallacious &s;ubtilty.</P>
<P>MY father, who had no other wi&s;h than to &s;ee his &s;on richer than him&s;elf, ea&s;ily con|cluded that I &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf among the profe&s;&s;ors of the law; and therefore, when I had with great honour taken my fir&s;t degree, di&s;patched me to the <HI>temple</HI> with a pa|ternal admonition, that I &s;hould never &s;uffer my&s;elf to feel &s;hame, for nothing but mo|de&s;ty could retard my fortune.</P>
<P>VITIATED, ignorant, and heady as I was I had not yet lo&s;t my reverence for virtue, and therefore could not receive &s;uch dictates without horror; but however was plea&s;ed with his determination of my cour&s;e of life, becau&s;e he placed me in the way that leads &s;oone&s;t from the pre&s;cribed walks of di&s;cipline and education, to the open fields of liberty and choice.</P>

I WAS now in the place where every one catches the contagion of vanity, and &s;oon be|gan to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf by &s;ophi&s;ms and pa|radoxes.

<P>I APPLIED my&s;elf chiefly to tho&s;e parts of learning which have filled the world with doubt and perplexity, and could readily pro|duce all the arguments relating to matter and motion, time and &s;pace, identity and infinity.</P>
<P>I WAS equally able and equally willing to maintain the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Newton</HI> or <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> and favoured occa&s;ionally the hypothe&s;is of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> or that of <HI>Copernicus.</HI> I &s;ometimes exalted vegetables to &s;en&s;e, and &s;ometimes de|graded animals to mechani&s;m.</P>
<P>NOR was I le&s;s inclined to weaken the credit of hi&s;tory, or perplex the doctrines of
<PB N="227" REF="230">
polity. I was always of the party which I heard the company condemn.</P>
<P>AMONG the zealots of liberty, I could harangue with great copiou&s;ne&s;s upon the advantages of ab&s;olute monarchy, the &s;ecre&s;y of its coun&s;els, and the expedition of its mea|&s;ures; and often celebrated the ble&s;&s;ings pro|duced by the extinction of parties, and pre|clu&s;ion of debates.</P>
<P>AMONG the a&s;&s;ertors of regal authority, I never failed to declaim with republican warmth upon the original charter of univer&s;al liberty, the corruption of courts, and the folly of voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e whom nature has levelled with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I KNEW the defects of every &s;cheme of government, and the inconveniencies of every law. I &s;ometimes &s;hewed how much the condition of mankind would be improved by breaking the world into petty &s;overeignties, and &s;ometimes di&s;played the felicity and peace which univer&s;al monarchy would diffu&s;e over the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="231">
TO every acknowledged fact I found innu|merable objections; for it was my rule to judge of hi&s;tory only by rea&s;on, and therefore I made no &s;cruple of bidding defiance to te&s;ti|mony. I have more than once que&s;tioned the exi&s;tence of <HI>Alexander the Great</HI>; and having demon&s;trated the folly of erecting edi|fices like the pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> I frequently hinted my &s;u&s;picion that the world had been long deceived, and that they were to be found only in the narratives of travellers.</P>
<P>IT had been happy for me could I have confined my &s;ceptici&s;m to hi&s;torical contro|ver&s;ies, and philo&s;ophical di&s;qui&s;itions, but hav|ing now violated my rea&s;on, and accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to enquire not after proofs, but objec|tions, I had perplexed truth with fal&s;ehood till my ideas were confu&s;ed, my judgment embarra&s;&s;ed, and my intellects di&s;torted. The habit of con&s;idering every propo&s;ition as alike uncertain, left me no te&s;t by which any tenet could be tried; every opinion pre&s;ented both &s;ides with equal evidence, and my fallacies began to operate upon my own mind in more important enquiries. It was at la&s;t the &s;port of my vanity to weaken the obligations of mo|ral duty, and efface the di&s;tinctions of good
<PB N="229" REF="232">
and evil, till I had deadened the &s;en&s;e of con|viction, and abandoned my heart to the fluc|tuations of uncertainty, without anchor and without compa&s;s, without &s;atisfaction of cu|rio&s;ity or peace of con&s;cience without prin|ciples of rea&s;on or motives of action.</P>
<P>SUCH is the hazard of repre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t perceptions of truth, of &s;preading for diver|&s;ion the &s;nares of &s;ophi&s;try, and engaging rea|&s;on again&s;t its own determinations.</P>
<P>THE di&s;proportions of ab&s;urdity grow le&s;s and le&s;s vi&s;ible, as we are reconciled by de|grees to the deformity of a mi&s;tre&s;s; and fal&s;ehood, by long u&s;e, is a&s;&s;imilated to the mind, as poi&s;on to the body.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;oon the mortification of &s;eeing my conver&s;ation courted only by the igno|rant or wicked, by either boys who were enchanted by novelty, or wretches who hav|ing long di&s;obeyed virtue and rea&s;on, were now de&s;irous of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to dethrone them.</P>
<P>THUS alarmed, I &s;huddered at my own corruption, and that pride by which I had
<PB N="230" REF="233">
been &s;educed, contributed to reclaim me. I was weary of continual irre&s;olution, and a perpetual equipoi&s;e of the mind; and a&s;hamed of being the favourite of tho&s;e who were &s;corned and &s;hunned by the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE retired from all temp|tations to di&s;pute, pre&s;cribed a new regi|men to my under&s;tanding, and re&s;olved, in|&s;tead of rejecting all e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions which I could not prove, to admit all which I could not confute. I forbore to heat my imagina|tion with needle&s;s controver&s;ies, to di&s;cu&s;s que&s;tions confe&s;&s;edly uncertain, and refrained &s;teadily from gratifying my vanity by the &s;up|port of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>BY this method I am at length recovered from my argumental delirium, and find my|&s;elf in the &s;tate of one awakened from the confu&s;ion and tumult of a feveri&s;h dream. I rejoice in the new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of evidence and reality, and &s;tep on from truth to truth with confidence and quiet.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Quod &s;i <HI>Platonis</HI> mu&s;a per&s;onat verum,</L>
<L>Quod qui&s;que di&s;cit, immemor recordatur.</L> </Q>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is reported of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> by an an|cient writer that the &s;um of their education con&s;i&s;ted in teaching youth <HI>to ride, to &s;hoot with the bow, and to &s;peak truth.</HI></P>
<P>THE bow and the hor&s;e were ea&s;ily ma|&s;tered, but it would have been happy if we had been informed by what arts veracity was cultivated, and by what pre&s;ervatives a <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> mind was &s;ecured again&s;t the temptations to fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, in the pre&s;ent cor|ruption of mankind, many incitements to for&s;ake truth; the need of palliating our own faults, and the convenience of impo&s;ing on the ignorance or credulty of others &s;o fre|quently occur, &s;o many immediate evils are to be avoided, and &s;o many pre&s;ent gratifica|tions obtained by craft and delu&s;ion, that very
<PB N="232" REF="235">
few of tho&s;e who are much entangled in life, have &s;pirit and con&s;tancy &s;ufficient to &s;up|port them in the &s;teady practice of open veracity.</P>
<P>IN order that all men may be taught to &s;peak truth, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all likewi&s;e &s;hould learn to hear it; for no &s;pecies of fal&s;e|hood is more frequent than flattery, to which the coward is betrayed by fear, the dependent by intere&s;t, and the friend by tenderne&s;s: Tho&s;e who are neither &s;ervile nor timorous, are yet de&s;irous to be&s;tow plea&s;ure; and while unju&s;t demands of prai&s;e continue to be made, there will always be &s;ome whom hope, fear or kindne&s;s will di&s;po&s;e to pay them.</P>
<P>THE guilt of fal&s;ehood is very widely ex|tended, and many whom their con&s;cience can &s;carcely charge with &s;tooping to a lye, have vitiated the morals of others by their vanity, and patronized the vice which they believe them&s;elves to abhor.</P>
<P>TRUTH is, indeed, not often welcome for its own &s;ake; it is generally unplea&s;ing becau&s;e contrary to our wi&s;hes and oppo&s;ite to our practice; and as our attention naturally
<PB N="233" REF="236">
follows our intere&s;t, we very unwillingly hear what we are afraid to know, and very &s;oon forget what we have no inclination to impre&s;s upon our memories.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on many arts of in&s;truction have been invented, by which the reluctance again&s;t Truth may be overcome, and as phy|&s;ick is given to children in confections, pre|cepts have been hidden under a thou&s;and ap|pearances, that mankind may be bribed by plea&s;ure to e&s;cape de&s;truction.</P>
<P>WHILE the world was yet in its infancy TRUTH came among mortals from above, and FALSEHOOD from below. TRUTH was the daughter of JUPITER and WISDOM; FALSEHOOD was the progeny of FOLLY impregnated by the wind. They advanced with equal confidence to &s;eize the dominion of the new creation, and as their enmity and their force were well known to the cele&s;tials, all the eyes of heaven were turned upon the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>TRUTH &s;eemed con&s;cious of &s;uperior power and ju&s;ter claim, and therefore came on towering and maje&s;tick, una&s;&s;i&s;ted and
<PB N="234" REF="237">
alone; REASON indeed always attended her, but appeared her follower, rather than com|panion. Her march was &s;low and &s;tately, but her motion was perpetually progre&s;&s;ive, and when once &s;he had grounded her foot, neither gods nor men could force her to retire.</P>
<P>FALSEHOOD always endeavoured to copy the mien and attitudes of TRUTH, and was very &s;ucce&s;sful in the arts of mimickry. She was &s;urrounded, animated, and &s;upported by innumerable legions of appetites and pa&s;|&s;ions, but, like other &s;eeble commanders, was obliged often to receive law from her allies. Her motions were &s;udden, irregular, and violent; for &s;he had no &s;teadine&s;s nor con|&s;tancy. She often gained conque&s;ts by ha&s;ty incur&s;ions, which &s;he never hoped to keep by her own &s;trength, but maintained by the help of the pa&s;&s;ions, whom &s;he generally found re&s;olute and faithful.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happened that the antagoni&s;ts met in full oppo&s;ition. In the&s;e encounters, FALSEHOOD always inve&s;ted her head with clouds, and commanded FRAUD to place ambu&s;hes about her. In her left hand &s;he
<PB N="235" REF="238">
bore the &s;hield of IMPUDENCE, and the quiver of SOPHISTRY rattled on her &s;houl|der. All the pa&s;&s;ions attended at her call; VA|NITY clapped her wings before, and OB|STINACY &s;upported her behind. Thus guarded and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;he &s;ometimes advanced again&s;t TRUTH, and &s;ometimes waited the attack; but always endeavoured to &s;kirmi&s;h at a di&s;tance, perpetually &s;hifted her ground, and let fly her arrows in different directions; for &s;he certainly found that her &s;trength fail|ed, whenever the eye of TRUTH darted full upon her.</P>
<P>TRUTH had the awful a&s;pect though not the thunder of her father, and when the long continuance of the conte&s;t brought them near to one another, FALSEHOOD let the arms of SOPHISTRY fall from her gra&s;p, and, hold|ing up the &s;hield of IMPUDENCE with both her hands, &s;heltered her&s;elf among&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>TRUTH, though &s;he was often wounded, always recovered in a &s;hort time; but it was common for the &s;lighte&s;t hurt, received by FALSEHOOD, to &s;pread its malignity to the
<PB N="236" REF="239">
neighbouring parts, and to bur&s;t open again when it &s;eemed to have been cured.</P>
<P>FALSEHOOD, in a &s;hort time, found by experience that her &s;uperiority con&s;i&s;ted only in the celerity of her cour&s;e, and the changes of her po&s;ture. She therefore ordered SUSPI|CION to beat the ground before her, and a|voided with great care to cro&s;s the way of TRUTH, who, as &s;he never varied her point, but moved con&s;tantly upon the &s;ame line, was ea&s;ily e&s;caped by the oblique and de&s;ultory movements, the quick retreats and active doubles which FALSEHOOD always practi&s;ed, when the enemy began to rai&s;e terror by her approach.</P>
<P>BY this procedure FALSEHOOD every hour encroached upon the world, and extend|ed her empire through all climes and regions. Wherever &s;he carried her victories &s;he left the PASSIONS in full authority behind her; who were &s;o well plea&s;ed with command, that they held out with great ob&s;tinacy when TRUTH came to &s;eize their po&s;ts, and ne|ver failed to retard her progre&s;s though they could not always &s;top it: They yielded at
<PB N="237" REF="240">
la&s;t with great reluctance, frequent rallies, and &s;ullen &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and always inclined to revolt when TRUTH cea&s;ed to awe them by her immediate pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>TRUTH who, when &s;he fir&s;t de&s;cended from the heavenly palaces, expected to have been received by univer&s;al acclamation, che|ri&s;hed with kindne&s;s, heard with obedience, and invited to &s;pread her influence from pro|vince to province, now found that, wherever &s;he came, &s;he mu&s;t force her pa&s;&s;age. Every intellect was precluded by PREJUDICE, and every heart preoccupied by PASSION. She indeed advanced, but &s;he advanced &s;lowly, and often lo&s;t the conque&s;ts which &s;he left behind her, by &s;udden in&s;urrections of the appetites, that &s;hook off their allegiance, and ranged them&s;elves again under the banner of her enemy.</P>
<P>TRUTH, however, did not grow weaker by the &s;truggle, for her vigour was uncon|querable, yet &s;he was provoked to &s;ee her&s;elf thus baffled and impeded by an enemy, whom &s;he looked on with contempt, and who had no advantage but &s;uch as &s;he owed to incon|&s;tancy,
<PB N="238" REF="241">
weakne&s;s, and artifice. She there|fore, in the anger of di&s;appointment, called upon her father JUPITER to re-e&s;tabli&s;h her in the &s;kies, and leave mankind to the di&s;or|der and mi&s;ery which they de&s;erved by &s;ub|mitting willingly to the u&s;urpation of FALSE|HOOD.</P>
<P>JUPITER compa&s;&s;ionated the world too much to grant her reque&s;t, yet was willing to ea&s;e her labours and mitigate her vexation. He commanded her to con&s;ult the mu&s;es by what methods &s;he might obtain an ea&s;ier re|ception, and reign without the toil of ince&s;|&s;ant war. It was then di&s;covered, that &s;he ob&s;tructed her own progre&s;s by the &s;everity of her a&s;pect, and the &s;olemnity of her dic|tates; and that men would never willingly admit her, till they cea&s;ed to fear her, &s;ince by giving them&s;elves up to FALSEHOOD they &s;eldom made any &s;acrifice of their ea&s;e or plea&s;ure, becau&s;e &s;he took the &s;hape that was mo&s;t engaging, and always &s;uffered her|&s;elf to be dre&s;&s;ed and painted by DESIRE. The mu&s;es wove in the loom of <HI>Pallas,</HI> a loo&s;e and changeable robe, like that in which FALSEHOOD captivated her admirers; with this they inve&s;ted TRUTH, and named her
<PB N="239" REF="242">
FICTION. She now went out again to conquer with more &s;ucce&s;s; for when &s;he de|manded entrance of the PASSIONS, they of|ten mi&s;took her for FALSEHOOD, and deli|vered up their charge; but when &s;he had once taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he was &s;oon di&s;robed by REASON, and &s;hone out, in her original form, with native effulgence and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s dignity.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the SPECTATOR was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in &s;ingle papers, it gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure, that it is one of the fa|vourite amu&s;ements of my age to recollect it; and when I reflect on the &s;oibles of tho&s;e times as de&s;cribed in that u&s;eful work, and compare them with the vices now reigning among us, I cannot but wi&s;h that you would oftener take
<PB N="241" REF="244">
cognizance of the manners of the better half of the human &s;pecies, that if your precepts and ob&s;ervations be carried down to po&s;terity, the SPECTATORS may &s;hew to the ri&s;ing generation what were the fa&s;hionable follies of their grandmothers, the RAMBLER of their mothers, and that from both they may draw in&s;truction and warning.</P>
<P>WHEN I read tho&s;e SPECTATORS which took notice of the mi&s;behaviour of young women at church by which they vainly hope to attract admirers, I u&s;ed to pronounce &s;uch forward young women SEEKERS, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h them by a mark of infamy from tho&s;e who had patience and decency to &s;tay till they were &s;ought.</P>
<P>BUT I have lived to &s;ee &s;uch a change in the manners of women, that I would now be willing to compound with them for that name, although I then thought it di&s;graceful enough, if they would de&s;erve no wor&s;e; &s;ince now they are too generally given up to negligence of dome&s;tick bu&s;ine&s;s, to idle amu&s;ements, and to wicked rackets, without any &s;ettled view at all but of &s;quandering time.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="245">
IN the time of the SPECTATOR, except|ing &s;ometimes an appearance in the ring, &s;ometimes at a good and cho&s;en play, &s;ome|times on a vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of a grave rela|tion, the young ladies contented them&s;elves to be found employed in dome&s;tick duties; for then routs, drums, balls, a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;uch like markets for women were not known.</P>
<P>MODESTY and diffidence, gentlene&s;s and meekne&s;s, were looked upon as the appro|priate virtues and characteri&s;tick graces of the &s;ex. And if a forward &s;pirit pu&s;hed it&s;elf into notice, it was expo&s;ed in print as it de|&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE churches were almo&s;t the only places where &s;ingle women were to be &s;een by &s;tran|gers. Men went thither expecting to &s;ee them; and perhaps too much for that only purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome good often re&s;ulted, however improper was their motive. Both &s;exes were in the way of their duty. The man mu&s;t be abandoned indeed, who loves not goodne&s;s in another; nor were the young fellows of
<PB N="243" REF="246">
that age &s;o wholly lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of right, as pride and conceit has &s;ince made them affect to be. When therefore they &s;aw a fair-one who&s;e decent behaviour and chearful piety &s;hewed her earne&s;t in her fir&s;t duties, they had the le&s;s doubt, judging politically only, that &s;he would have a con&s;cientious regard to her &s;econd.</P>
<P>WITH what ardor have I &s;een watched for, the ri&s;ing of a kneeling beauty? and what additional charms has devotion given to her recommunicated features?</P>
<P>THE men were often the better for what they heard. Even a <HI>Saul</HI> was once found prophe&s;ying among the prophets whom he had &s;et out to de&s;troy. To a man thus put into good humour by a plea&s;ing object, religion it&s;elf looked more amiably. The MEN SEEKERS of the SPECTATOR'S time loved the holy place for the object's &s;ake, and loved the object for her &s;uitable behaviour in it.</P>
<P>REVERENCE mingled with their love, and they thought that a young lady of &s;uch good principles mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed only by the man, who at lea&s;t made a &s;hew of good
<PB N="244" REF="247">
principles, whether his heart was yet quite right or not.</P>
<P>NOR did the young lady's behaviour, at any time of the &s;ervice, le&s;&s;en this reverence. Her eyes were her own, her ears the preach|er's. Women are always mo&s;t ob&s;erved, when they &s;eem them&s;elves lea&s;t to ob&s;erve, or to lay out for ob&s;ervation. The eye of a re&s;pectful lover loves rather to receive confi|dence from the withdrawn eye of the fair|one, than to find it&s;elf obliged to retreat.</P>
<P>WHEN a young gentleman's affection was thus laudably engaged, he pur&s;ued its natural dictates; keeping then was a rare, at lea&s;t a &s;ecret and &s;candalous vice, and a wife was the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes. Rejection was now dreaded, and pre-engagement ap|prehended. A woman whom he loved, he was ready to think mu&s;t be admired by all the world. His fears, his uncertainties, in|crea&s;ed his love.</P>
<P>EVERY enquiry he made into the lady's dome&s;tick excellence, which, when a wife is to be cho&s;en, will &s;urely not be neglected, confirmed him in his choice. He opens his
<PB N="245" REF="248">
heart to a common friend, and hone&s;tly di&s;|covers the &s;tate of his fortune. His friend applies to tho&s;e of the young lady, who&s;e parents, if they approve his propo&s;als, di&s;|clo&s;e them to their daughter.</P>
<P>SHE perhaps is not an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ion of the young gentleman. His eyes, his a&s;&s;iduities, his con&s;tant attendance at a church, whither till of late, he u&s;ed &s;eldom to come, and a thou&s;and little ob&s;ervances that he paid her, had very probably fir&s;t forced her to regard, and then inclined her to favour him.</P>
<P>THAT a young lady &s;hould be in love, and the love of the young gentleman unde|clared, is an heterodoxy which prudence, and even policy, mu&s;t not allow. But thus applied to, &s;he is all re&s;ignation to her pa|rents. Charming re&s;ignation, which inclina|tion oppo&s;es not.</P>
<P>HER relations applaud her for her duty; friends meet; points are adju&s;ted; delight|ful perturbations, and hopes, and a few lover's fears, fill up the tedious &s;pace, till an
<PB N="246" REF="249">
interview is granted; for the young lady had not made her cheap at publick places.</P>
<P>THE time of interview arrives. She is mode&s;tly re&s;erved; he is not confident. He declares his pa&s;&s;ion; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own worth, and his application to her parents, take from her any doubt of his &s;incerity; and &s;he owns her&s;elf obliged to him for his good opinion. The enquiries of her friends into his character, have taught her that his good opinion de&s;erves to be valued.</P>
<P>SHE tacitly allows of his future vi&s;its; he renews them; the regard of each for the other is confirmed; and when he pre&s;&s;es for the favour of her hand, he receives a declara|tion of an entire acquie&s;cence with her duty, and a mode&s;t acknowledgement of e&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>HE applies to her parents therefore for a near day; and thinks him&s;elf under obligation to them for the chearful and affectionate man|ner with which they receive his agreeable ap|plication.</P>
<P>WITH this pro&s;pect of future happine&s;s, the marriage is celebrated. Gratulations pour
<PB N="247" REF="250">
in from every quarter. Parents and relations on both &s;ides, brought acquainted in the cour&s;e of the court&s;hip, can receive the hap|py couple with countenances illumined, and joyful hearts.</P>
<P>THE brothers, the &s;i&s;ters, the friends of one family, are the brothers the &s;i&s;ters, the friends of the other. Their two families thus made one, are the world to the young couple.</P>
<P>THEIR home is the place of their prin|cipal delight, nor do they ever occa&s;ionally quit it but they find the plea&s;ure of return|ing to it augmented in proportion to the time of their ab&s;ence from it.</P>
<P>OH Mr. RAMBLER! forgive the talka|tivene&s;s of an old man! when I courted and married my <HI>Laetitia,</HI> than a blooming beauty, every thing pa&s;&s;ed ju&s;t &s;o! But how is the ca&s;e now? The ladies, maidens, wives and wi|dows are engro&s;&s;ed by places of open re&s;ort, and general entertainment which fill every quarter of the metropolis, and being con&s;tant|ly frequented, make home irk&s;ome. Break|fa&s;ting-places,
<PB N="248" REF="251">
dining-places; routs, drums, concerts, balls, plays, operas, ma&s;querades for the evening, and even for all night, and lately, publick &s;ales of the goods of broken hou&s;ekeepers, which the general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners has contributed to make very fre|quent, come in as another &s;ea&s;onable relief to the&s;e modern time-killers.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer there are in every country town a&s;&s;emblies; <HI>Tunbridge, Bath, Chelten|ham, Scarborough!</HI> What expence of dre&s;s and equipage is required to qualify the fre|quenters for &s;uch emulous appearance?</P>
<P>BY the natural infection of example, the lowe&s;t people have places of &s;ix-penny re&s;ort, and gaming tables for pence. Thus &s;ervants are now induced to fraud and di&s;hone&s;ty, to &s;upport extravagance, and &s;upply their lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>AS to the ladies who frequent tho&s;e publick places, they are not a&s;hamed to &s;hew their faces wherever men dare go, nor blu&s;h to try who &s;hall &s;tare mo&s;t impudently, or who &s;hall laugh loude&s;t on the publick walks.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="252">
THE men who would make good hu&s;|bands, if they vi&s;it tho&s;e places, are frighted at wedlock, and re&s;olve to live &s;ingle, except they are bought at a very high price. They can be &s;pectators of all that pa&s;&s;es, and, if they plea&s;e, more than &s;pectators, at the ex|pence of others. The companion of an even|ing, and the companion for life, require very different qualifications.</P>
<P>TWO thou&s;and pounds in the la&s;t age, with a dome&s;tick wife, would go farther than ten thou&s;and in this. Yet &s;ettlements are expected, that often, to a mercantile man e&s;pecially, &s;ink a fortune into u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s; and pin-money is &s;tipulated for, which makes a wife independent, and de&s;troys love, by put|ting it out of a man's power to lay any obli|gation upon her, that might engage gratitude, and kindle affection: When to all this the card-tables are added, how can a prudent man think of marrying?</P>
<P>AND when the worthy men know not where to find wives, mu&s;t not the &s;ex be left to the foplings, the coxcombs, the libertines of the age, whom they help to make &s;uch?
<PB N="250" REF="253">
And need even the&s;e wretches marry to enjoy the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who render their company &s;o cheap?</P>
<P>AND what, after all, is the benefit which the gay coquet obtains by her flutters? As &s;he is approachable by every man without re|quiring, I will not &s;ay incen&s;e or adoration, but even common complai&s;ance, every fop treats her as upon the level, looks upon her light airs as invitations, and is on the watch to take the advantage: &s;he has companions indeed, but no lovers; for love is re&s;pectful, and timorous; and where among all her fol|lowers will &s;he find a hu&s;band?</P>
<P>SET, dear Sir, before the youthful, the gay, the incon&s;iderate, the contempt as well as the danger to which they are expo&s;ed. At one time or other, women, not utterly thoughtle&s;s, will be convinced of the ju&s;tice of your cen&s;ure, and the charity of your in|&s;truction.</P>

<HEAD>To the AUTHOR of the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have often endeavoured to impre&s;s upon your readers an ob&s;ervation of more truth than novelty, that life pa&s;&s;es, for the mo&s;t part, in petty tran&s;actions; that our hours glide away in trifling amu&s;ements and &s;light gratifications; and that there very &s;el|dom emerges any occa&s;ion that can call forth great virtue or great abilities.</P>
<P>IT very commonly hapens that &s;peculation has no influence on conduct. Ju&s;t conclu|&s;ions, and cogent arguments, formed by la|borious &s;tudy, and diligent enquiry, are of|ten repo&s;ited in the trea&s;uries of memory, as
<PB N="253" REF="256">
gold in the mi&s;er's che&s;t u&s;ele&s;s alike to others and him&s;elf. As &s;ome are not richer for the extent of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, others are not wi&s;er for the multitude of their ideas.</P>
<P>YOU have very truly de&s;cribed the &s;tate of human beings, but it may be doubted whe|ther you have &s;ufficiently accommodated your precepts to your de&s;cription; whether you have not generally con&s;idered your readers as influenced wholly by the more violent and tra|gick pa&s;&s;ions, engaged always in deep de&s;igns and important pur&s;uits, and &s;u&s;ceptible of pain or plea&s;ure only from powerful agents and from great events.</P>
<P>TO an author who writes not for the elu|cidation or improvement of any &s;ingle art, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any controverted doc|trine, or the promotion of any particular purpo&s;e, but equally intends the advantage, and equally courts the peru&s;al of all the cla&s;&s;es of mankind, nothing can ju&s;tly &s;eem unworthy of regard, by which the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ation may be increa&s;ed, and the daily &s;atisfactions of familiar life &s;ecured from interruption and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="257">
FOR this rea&s;on you would not have in|jured your reputation, if you had &s;ometimes de&s;cended to the minuter duties of &s;ocial be|ings, and enforced the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e little civilities and ceremonious delicacies, which, incon&s;iderable as they may appear to the man of &s;cience, and difficult as they may prove to be detailed with the dignity of a phi|lo&s;opher, yet contribute to the regulation of the world, by facilitating the intercour&s;e be|tween one man and another, and of which the <HI>French</HI> have &s;ufficiently te&s;tified their e&s;teem by terming the knowledge and practice of them <HI>S&ccedil;avoir vivre, the art of living.</HI></P>
<P>POLITENESS is one of tho&s;e advantages which we never e&s;timate rightly but by the inconvenience of its lo&s;s. Its influence upon the manners is con&s;tant and uniform, &s;o that, like an equal motion, it e&s;capes perception. The circum&s;tances of every action are &s;o ad|ju&s;ted to each other, that we do not &s;ee where any error could have been committed, and ra|ther acquiefce in its propriety, than admire its exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT as &s;ickne&s;s &s;hews us the value of ea&s;e, a little familiarity with tho&s;e who were ne|ver
<PB N="255" REF="258">
taught to endeavour the gratification of others, but regulate their behaviour merely by their own will, will &s;oon evince the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hed modes and formalities to the happine&s;s and quiet of common life.</P>
<P>WISDOM and virtue are by no means &s;ufficient without the &s;upplemental laws of good-breeding to &s;ecure freedom from dege|nerating to rudene&s;s, or &s;elf-e&s;teem from &s;welling into in&s;olence; and a thou&s;and of|fences may be committed, and a thou&s;and offices neglected without any remor&s;e of con|&s;cience, or reproach from rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE true effect of genuine politene&s;s &s;eems to be rather ea&s;e than plea&s;ure. The pow|er of delighting mu&s;t be conferred by na|ture, and cannot be delivered by precept, or obtained by imitation; but though it be the privilege of a very &s;mall number to ravi&s;h and to charm, every man may hope by rules and caution not to give pain, and may, there|fore, by the help of good-breeding enjoy the kindne&s;s of mankind, though he &s;hould have no claim to higher di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="259">
THE univer&s;al axiom in which all com|plai&s;ance is included, and from which flow all the formalities which cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in civili&s;ed nations, is, <HI>That no man &s;hould give any preference to him&s;elf.</HI> A rule &s;o com|prehen&s;ive and certain, that, perhaps, it is not ea&s;y for the mind to image an incivility, without &s;uppo&s;ing it to be broken.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, in every place &s;ome particular modes of the ceremonial part of good-breeding, which, being arbitrary and accidental, can be learned only by habitude and conver&s;ation; &s;uch are the forms of &s;alu|tation, the different gradations of reverence, and all the adju&s;tments of place and prece|dence. The&s;e, however, may be often violat|ed without offence, if it be be &s;ufficiently evi|dent, that neither malice nor pride contri|buted to the failure, but will not atone, however rigidly ob&s;erved, for the tumour of in&s;olence, or petulance of contempt.</P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, not found among any part of mankind, le&s;s real and rational com|plai&s;ance, than among tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed their time in paying and receiving vi&s;its, in
<PB N="257" REF="260">
frequenting publick entertainments, in &s;tudy|ing the exact mea&s;ures of ceremony, and in watching all the variations of fa&s;hionable courte&s;y.</P>
<P>THEY know, indeed, at what hour they may beat the door of an acquaintance, how many &s;teps they mu&s;t attend him towards the gate, and what interval &s;hould pa&s;s before his vi&s;it is returned, but &s;eldom extend their care beyond the exterior and une&s;&s;ential parts of civility, nor refu&s;e their own vanity any gratification, however expen&s;ive to the quiet of another.</P>
<P><HI>TRYPHERUS</HI> is a man remarkable for elegance and expence; a man, that having been originally placed by his fortune and rank in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the community, has ac|quired that air of dignity, and that readine&s;s in the exchange of compliments which courts balls and levees ea&s;ily confer.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Trypherus,</HI> without any &s;ettled pur|po&s;es of malignity, partly by his ignorance of human nature, and partly by the habit of contemplating with great &s;atisfaction his own
<PB N="258" REF="261">
grandeur and riches, is hourly giving di&s;gu&s;t to tho&s;e whom chance or expectation &s;ubject to his vanity.</P>
<P>TO a man who&s;e fortune confines him to a &s;mall hou&s;e, he declaims upon the plea&s;ure of &s;pacious apartments, and the convenience of changing his lodging room in different parts of the year; tells him that he hates confine|ment; and concludes, that if his chamber was le&s;s, he &s;hould never wake without think|ing of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>TO <HI>Eucrates,</HI> a man of birth equal to him|&s;elf, but of much le&s;s e&s;tate, he &s;hewed his &s;ervices of plate, and remarked that &s;uch things were, indeed, nothing better than co&s;t|ly trifles, but that no man mu&s;t pretend to the rank of a gentleman without them; and that for his part, if his e&s;tate was &s;maller, he &s;hould not think of enjoying but encrea&s;ing it, and would enquire out a trade for his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>HE has, in imitation of &s;ome more acute ob&s;erver than him&s;elf, collected a great many &s;hifts and artifices by which poverty is concealed, and among ladies of &s;mall
<PB N="259" REF="262">
fortune, never fails to talk of frippery and &s;light &s;ilks, and the convenience of a general mourning.</P>
<P>I HAVE been in&s;ulted a thou&s;and times with a catalogue of his pictures, his jewels, and his rarities, which, though he knows the humble neatne&s;s of my habitation, he &s;el|dom fails to conclude by a declaration, that wherever he &s;ees a hou&s;e meanly furni&s;hed, he de&s;pi&s;es the owner's ta&s;te or pities his po|verty.</P>
<P>THIS, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> is the practice of <HI>Trypherus,</HI> by which he is become the terror of all who are le&s;s wealthy than him&s;elf, and has rai&s;ed innumerable enemies without rivalry, and without malevolence.</P>
<P>YET though all are not equally culpa|ble with <HI>Trypherus,</HI> it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to find any man who does not frequently, like him, indulge his own pride by forcing others into a compari&s;on with him&s;elf, when he knows the advantage is on his &s;ide, without con&s;idering that unnece&s;&s;arily to obtrude un|plea&s;ing ideas is a &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion, and that it is little more criminal to deprive
<PB N="260" REF="263">
another of &s;ome real advantage, than to in|terrupt that forgetfulne&s;s of its ab&s;ence which is the next happine&s;s to actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>IT has been ordained by providence, for the con&s;ervation of order in the im|men&s;e variety of created nature, and for the regular propagation of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of life with which the elements are peopled, that every creature &s;hould be drawn by &s;ome &s;ecret attraction to tho&s;e of his own kind; and that not only the gentle and dome&s;tick animals which naturally unite into companies or cohabit by pairs, &s;hould continue faithful to their &s;pecies, but even tho&s;e ravenous and ferocious &s;avages which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves never to be gregarious, &s;hould range moun|tains and de&s;arts in &s;earch of one another, rather than pollute the world with a mon|&s;trous birth.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="265">
As the perpetuity and di&s;tinction of the lower tribes of the creation require that they &s;hould be determined to proper mates by &s;ome uniform motive of choice, or &s;ome co|gent principle of in&s;tinct; it is nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e, that man who&s;e wider capacity de|mands more gratifications, and who feels in him&s;elf innumerable wants, which a life of &s;olitude cannot &s;upply, and innumerable pow|ers to which it cannot give employment, &s;hould be led to &s;uitable companions by particular in|fluence; that among many beings of the &s;ame nature with him&s;elf, he may &s;elect &s;ome for intimacy and tenderne&s;s, and improve the condition of his exi&s;tence, by &s;uperadding friend&s;hip to humanity, and the love of indi|viduals to that of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>OTHER animals are &s;o formed, that they &s;eem to contribute very little to the happi|ne&s;s of each other, and know neither joy, nor grief, nor love, nor hatred, but as they are urged by &s;ome de&s;ire immediately &s;ub|&s;ervient either to the &s;upport of their own lives, or to the continuation of their race; they therefore &s;eldom appear to regard any of the minuter di&s;criminations which di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="263" REF="266">
creatures of the &s;ame kind from one ano|ther.</P>
<P>BUT if man were to feel no incentives to kindne&s;s, more than his general tendency to congenial nature, <HI>Babylon</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> with all their multitudes, would have to him the de&s;olation of a wilderne&s;s; his affections, not compre&s;&s;ed into a narrower compa&s;s, would vani&s;h like elemental fire, in boundle&s;s eva|poration, he would langui&s;h in perpetual in|&s;en&s;ibility, &s;u&s;pended between different im|pul&s;es; and though he might, perhaps, in the fir&s;t vigour of youth, amu&s;e him&s;elf with the fre&s;h enjoyments of life, yet, when cu|rio&s;ity &s;hould cea&s;e, and alacrity &s;ub&s;ide, he would abandon him&s;elf to the fluctuations of chance, without expecting help again&s;t any calamity, or feeling any wi&s;h for the happine&s;s of others.</P>
<P>TO love all men is our duty, &s;o far as it includes a general habit of benevolence, and readine&s;s of occa&s;ional kindne&s;s; but to love all equally is impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t impo&s;&s;ible without the extinction of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which now produce all our pains and all our plea|&s;ures, without the di&s;u&s;e, if not the aboli|tion
<PB N="264" REF="267">
of &s;ome of our faculties, and the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of all our hopes and fears in apathy and indifference.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ities of our condition require a thou&s;and offices of tenderne&s;s, which mere regard for the &s;pecies will never dictate. E|very man has frequent grievances which only the &s;olicitude of friend&s;hip will di&s;cover and remedy, and which would remain for ever unheeded in the mighty heap of human cala|mity, were it only &s;urveyed by the eye of ge|neral benevolence equally attentive to every mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE great community of mankind is therefore, nece&s;&s;arily broken into &s;maller in|dependent &s;ocieties; the&s;e form di&s;tinct inte|re&s;ts, which are too frequently oppo&s;ed to each other, and which they who have entered into the league of particular governments fal&s;ely think it virtue to promote, however de&s;tructive to the happine&s;s of the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>SUCH unions are again &s;eparated into &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es and combinations, and &s;o|cial
<PB N="265" REF="268">
life is perpetually branched out into mi|nuter &s;ubdivi&s;ions, till it terminates in the la&s;t ramifications of private friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THAT friend&s;hip may at once be fond and la&s;ting, it has been already ob&s;erved in the&s;e papers, that a conformity of inclinations is nece&s;&s;ary. No man can have much kind|ne&s;s for him by whom he does not believe him&s;elf e&s;teemed, and nothing &s;o evidently proves e&s;teem as imitation.</P>
<P>THAT benevolence is always &s;tronge&s;t which ari&s;es from participation of the &s;ame plea&s;ures, &s;ince we are naturally mo&s;t willing to revive in our minds the memory of per&s;ons, with whom the idea of enjoyment is con|nected.</P>
<P>IT is commonly, therefore, to little pur|po&s;e that any one endeavours to ingratiate him&s;elf with &s;uch as he cannot accompany in their amu&s;ements and diver&s;ions. Men have been known to ri&s;e to favour and to fortune, only by being &s;kilful in the &s;ports with which their patron happened to be de|lighted, by concurring with his ta&s;te for &s;ome particular &s;pecies of curio&s;ities, by reli&s;h|ing
<PB N="266" REF="269">
the &s;ame wine, or applauding the &s;ame cookery.</P>
<P>EVEN tho&s;e whom their wi&s;dom or their virtue have placed above regard to &s;uch petty recommendations, mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be gained by &s;imilitude of manners. The highe&s;t and noble&s;t enjoyment of familiar life, the com|munication of knowledge and reciprocation of &s;entiments, mu&s;t always pre&s;uppo&s;e a di&s;|po&s;ition to the &s;ame inquiry, and delight in the &s;ame di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>WITH what &s;atisfaction could the politi|cian lay his &s;chemes for the reformation of laws, or his compari&s;ons of different forms of government, before the chemi&s;t, who has never accu&s;tomed his thoughts to any other object than &s;alt and &s;ulphur; or how could the a&s;tronomer, in explaining his calculations and conjectures, endure the coldne&s;s of a grammarian, who would lo&s;e &s;ight of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and all his <HI>&s;atellites,</HI> for a happy etymology of an ob&s;cure word, or a better explication of a controverted line.</P>
<P>EVERY man loves merit of the &s;ame kind with his own, when it is not likely to hin|der
<PB N="267" REF="270">
his advancement or his reputation; for he not only be&s;t under&s;tands the worth of tho&s;e qualities which he labours to cultivate, or the u&s;efulne&s;s of the art which he practi&s;es with &s;ucce&s;s, but always feels a reflected plea|&s;ure from the prai&s;es, which, though given to another, belong equally to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed no need of re&s;earch and refinement to di&s;cover that men mu&s;t generally &s;elect their companions from their own &s;tate of life, &s;ince there are not many minds furni&s;hed for great variety of conver&s;ation, or adapted to multiplicity of intellectual entertainments.</P>
<P>THE &s;ailor, the academick, the lawyer, the mechanick, and the courtier, have all a ca&s;t of talk peculiar to their own fraternity, have fixed their attention upon the &s;ame events, have been engaged in affairs of the &s;ame &s;ort, and make u&s;e of allu&s;ions and illu&s;trations which them&s;elves only can under&s;tand.</P>
<P>TO be infected with the jargon of a particu|lar profe&s;&s;ion, and to know only the language of a &s;ingle rank of mortals, is indeed &s;uffi|ciently de&s;picable. But as limits mu&s;t be always &s;et to the excur&s;ions of the human
<PB N="268" REF="271">
mind, there will be &s;ome &s;tudy which every man more zealou&s;ly pro&s;ecutes, &s;ome darling &s;ubject on which he is principally plea&s;ed to conver&s;e, and he that can mo&s;t inform or be&s;t under&s;tand him, will certainly be wel|comed with particular regard.</P>
<P>SUCH partiality is not wholly to be avoided, nor is it culpable unle&s;s &s;uffered &s;o far to pre|dominate as to produce aver&s;ion from every other kind of excellence, and to &s;hade the lu&s;tre of di&s;&s;imilar virtues. Tho&s;e, therefore, whom the lot of life has conjoined, &s;hould endeavour con&s;tantly to approach towards the inclination of each other, invigorate every motion of concurrent de&s;ire, and fan every &s;park of kindred curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that di&s;cord generally operates in little things; it is in|flamed to its utmo&s;t vehemence by contra|riety of ta&s;te, oftener than of principles; and might therefore commonly be avoided by in|nocent conformity, which, if it was not at fir&s;t the motive, ought always to be the con|&s;equence of indi&s;&s;oluble union.</P>

<P>AS very many well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons by the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of their af|fairs, are &s;o unfortunate as to be totally bu|ried in the country, where they labour under the mo&s;t deplorable ignorance of what is tran&s;acting among the polite part of man|kind, I cannot help thinking, that, as a pub|lick writer, you &s;hould take the ca&s;e of the&s;e truly compa&s;&s;ionable objects under your con|&s;ideration.</P>

<P>IT is inconceivable how much the welfare of all the country towns in the kingdom might be promoted, if you would u&s;e your charitable endeavours to rai&s;e in them a noble emulation of the manners and cu&s;toms of higher life.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e you &s;hould give a very clear and ample de&s;cription of the whole &s;et of polite acquirements; a compleat hi&s;tory of forms, fa&s;hions, frolicks, of routs, drums, hurricanes, balls, a&s;&s;emblies, ridottos, ma&s;|querades, auctions, plays, operas, puppet|&s;hows, and bear-gardens: of all tho&s;e delights which profitably engage the attention of the mo&s;t &s;ublime characters, and by which they have brought to &s;uch amazing perfection the whole art and my&s;tery of pa&s;&s;ing day after day, week after week, and year after year, without the heavy a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any one thing that formal creatures are plea&s;ed to call u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

you may add &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible argu|ments in its favour, as mu&s;t convince num|bers, who in other in&s;tances do not &s;eem to want natural under&s;tanding, of the unaccount|able error of &s;uppo&s;ing they were &s;ent into the world for any other purpo&s;e but to flutter, &s;port, and &s;hine.

<P>It is time enough &s;urely to think of con|&s;equences when they come; and as for the antiquated notions of duty, they are not to be met with in any <HI>French</HI> novel, or any book one ever looks into, but derived almo&s;t wholly from the writings of authors, who lived a va&s;t many ages ago, and who, as they totally without any idea of tho&s;e accompil&s;h|ments
<PB N="272" REF="275">
which now characteri&s;e people of di&s;tinction, have been for &s;ome time &s;ink|ing apace into utter contempt. It does not appear that even their mo&s;t zealous ad|mirers, for &s;ome parti&s;ans of his own &s;ort every writer will have, can pretend to &s;ay they were ever at one ridotto.</P>
<P>IN the important article of diver&s;ions, the ceremonial of vi&s;its, the extatick delight of unfriendly intimacies and unmeaning civilities, they are ab&s;olutely &s;ilent. Blunt truth, and downright hone&s;ty, plain clothes, &s;taying at home, hard work, few words, and tho&s;e unenlivened with cen&s;ure or double meaning, are what they recommend as the ornaments and plea&s;ures of life. Little oaths, polite di&s;&s;imulation, tea-table &s;candal, de|lightful indolence, the glitter of finery, the triumph of precedence, the enchantments of flattery, they &s;eem to have had no notion of, and I cannot but laugh to think what a figure they would have made in a draw|ing-room, and how frighted they would have looked at a gaming-table.</P>
<P>THE noble zeal of patrioti&s;m that di&s;|dains authority, and tramples on laws for
<PB N="273" REF="276">
&s;port, was ab&s;olutely the aver&s;ion of the&s;e tame wretches.</P>
<P>INDEED one cannot but di&s;cover any one thing they pretend to teach people, but to be wi&s;e, and good; acquirements infinite|ly below the con&s;ideration of per&s;ons of ta&s;te and &s;pirit, who know how to &s;pend their time to &s;o much better purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AMONG other admirable improvements, pray, Mr. <HI>Rambier,</HI> do not forget to enlarge on the very exten&s;ive benefit of playing at cards on Sundays, a practice of &s;uch infinite u&s;e, that we may mode&s;tly expect to &s;ee it prevail univer&s;ally in all parts of this king|dom.</P>
<P>TO per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, the advantage is obvious, becau&s;e as for &s;ome &s;trange rea&s;on or other, which no fine gentleman or fine lady has yet been able to penetrate, there is nei|ther play, nor ma&s;querade, nor bottled con|juror, nor any other thing worth living for, to be had on a Sunday, if it were not for the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of whi&s;t or bragg, the genteel part of mankind mu&s;t one day in &s;e|ven,
<PB N="274" REF="277">
nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer a total extinction of being.</P>
<P>NOR are the per&s;ons of high rank the only gainers by &s;o &s;alutary a cu&s;tom, which extends its good influence, in &s;ome degree, to the lower orders of people; but were it quite general how much better and happier would the world be than it is even now!</P>
<P>'TIS hard upon poor creatures, be they e|ver &s;o mean, to deny them tho&s;e enjoyments and liberties which are equally open for all. Yet if &s;ervants were taught to go to church on this day, &s;pend &s;ome part of it in reading or receiving in&s;truction in a family way, and the re&s;t in mere friendly conver&s;ation, the poor wretches would infallibly take it into their heads, that they were obliged to be &s;ober, mo|de&s;t, diligent, and faithful to their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>NOW &s;urely no one of common prudence or humanity would wi&s;h their dome&s;ticks infect|ed with &s;uch &s;trange and primitive notions, or laid under &s;uch unmerciful re&s;traints: All which may, in a great mea&s;ure, be prevented
<PB N="275" REF="278">
by the prevalence of the good-humoured fa&s;hion that I would have you recommend, For when the lower kind of people &s;ee their betters with a truly laudable &s;pirit, in&s;ulting and flying in the face of tho&s;e rude, ill-bred dictators, piety and the laws, they are there|by excited and admoni&s;hed, as far as actions can admoni&s;h and excite, and taught that they too have an equal right of &s;etting them at de|fiance in &s;uch in&s;tances as their particular ne|ce&s;&s;ities and inclinations may require; and thus is the liberty of the whole human &s;pecies mightily improved and enlarged.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> by a faithful repre|&s;entation of the numberle&s;s benefits of a mo|di&s;h life, you will have done your part in pro|moting what every body &s;eems to confe&s;s the true purpo&s;e of human exi&s;tence, perpetual di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>BY encouraging people to employ their whole attention on trifles, and make amu&s;e|ment their &s;ole &s;tudy, you will teach them how to avoid many very unea&s;y reflections.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;oft feelings of humanity, the &s;ym|pathies of friend&s;hip, all natural temptations
<PB N="276" REF="279">
to the care of a family, and &s;olicitude about the good or ill of others, with the whole train of dome&s;tick and &s;ocial affections, which create &s;uch daily anxieties and em|barra&s;ments, will be happily &s;tifled and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed in a round of perpetual delights; and all &s;erious thoughts, but particularly that of <HI>hereafter,</HI> be bani&s;hed out of the world; a mo&s;t perplexing apprehen&s;ion, but luckily a mo&s;t groundle&s;s one too, as it is &s;o very clear a ca&s;e, that nobody ever dies.</P>
