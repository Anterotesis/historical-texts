<L>Pleas'd, have I wander'd thro' your rough Domains;</L>
<L>Trod the pure, virgin, Snows, my &s;elf as pure:</L>

<L><PB N="2" REF="6">
Or &s;een the deep, fermenting, Tempe&s;t brew'd,</L>
<L>In the red, evening, Sky.&mdash;Thus pa&s;s'd the Time,</L>
<L>Till, thro' the opening Chambers of the South,</L>
<L>Look'd out the joyous <HI>Spring,</HI> look'd out, and &s;mil'd.</L>

<L>THEE too, In&s;pirer of the toiling Swain!</L>
<L>Fair AUTUMN, yellow rob'd! I'll &s;ing of thee,</L>

<L>When all the golden <HI>Hours</HI> are on the Wing,</L>

<L>Slow-rolling, onward to the Southern Sky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEHOLD! the well-pois'd <HI>Hornet,</HI> hovering, hangs,</L>
<L>With quivering Pinions, in the genial Blaze;</L>
<L>Flys off, in airy Circles: then returns,</L>
<L>And hums, and dances to the beating Ray.</L>
<L>Nor &s;hall the Man, that, mu&s;ing, walks alone,</L>
<L>And, heedle&s;s, &s;trays within his radiant Li&s;ts,</L>
<L>Go uncha&s;tis'd away.&mdash;Sometimes, a Fleece</L>

<L>Nipt by the drizzly Night, and Sallow-hu'd,</L>

<L>To the rough Stubble, and the ru&s;hy Fen.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Woodcocks,</HI> o'er the fluctuating Main,</L>
<L>That glimmers to the Glimp&s;es of the Moon,</L>
<L>Stretch their long Voyage to the woodland Glade:</L>
<L>Where, wheeling with uncertain Flight, they mock</L>
<L>The nimble <HI>Fowler</HI>'s Aim.&mdash;Now <HI>Nature</HI> droops;</L>
<L>Langui&s;h the living Herbs, with pale Decay:</L>
<L>And all the <HI>various Family</HI> of Flowers</L>
<L>Their &s;unny Robes re&s;ign. The falling Fruits,</L>
