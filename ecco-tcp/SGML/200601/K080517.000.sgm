<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SINCE I have ventur'd to write a Poem on a Gentle|man who is univer&s;ally acknowledg'd to be the Honour of our Country as a <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> prompted by the &s;ame Ambition, I addre&s;s it to her mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious <HI>Patriot.</HI></P>
<P>Tho', by the wi&s;e Choice of the be&s;t of <HI>Kings,</HI> you are engag'd in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t active Scenes of Life, balancing the Power of <HI>Europe,</HI> watch|ing over our common Welfare, infor|ming the whole Body of Society and Commerce, and even like Heaven di&s;|pen&s;ing Happine&s;s to the Di&s;contented
<PB REF="3">
and Ungrateful; tho' thus gloriou&s;ly employ'd, yet are you not le&s;s atten|tive, in the Hour of Lei&s;ure, to the Variety, Beauty, and Magnificence of Nature, nor le&s;s delighted, and a&s;to|ni&s;h'd at the Di&s;coveries of the incom|parable <HI>Newton.</HI> The &s;ame compre|hen&s;ive Genius which Way &s;oever it looks mu&s;t have a &s;teady, clear, and unbounded Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>But not to encroach any further on your important Moments all devoted to the Good of Mankind, I once more plead the Dignity of my Subject for my Excu&s;e in this Approach, and beg Leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf, with the &s;incere&s;t Veneration,</P>

<L>_SHALL the great Soul of NEWTON quit this Earth,</L>
<L>To mingle with his Stars, and every Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>A&s;toni&s;h'd into Silence, &s;hun the Weight</L>
<L>Of Honours due to his illu&s;trious Name!</L>
<L>But what can Man?&mdash;Even now the Sons of Light,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
In Strains &s;uch as delight the Ear of GOD,</L>
<L>Hail his Arrival on the Coa&s;ts of Bli&s;s.</L>

<L>And &s;ung to Harps of Angels; for with you,</L>

<LG>
<L>AND what new Wonders can ye &s;how your Gue&s;t!</L>
<L>Who, while on this dim Spot where Mortals toil</L>
<L>Clouded in Du&s;t, from <HI>Motion</HI>'s &s;imple Laws</L>
<L>Could trace the boundle&s;s Hand of Providence,</L>
<L>Wide-working thro' this univer&s;al Frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAVE ye not li&s;ten'd while he bound the <HI>Suns,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Planets</HI> to their Spheres! Th' unequal Task</L>
<L>Of Humankind till then. Oft had they roll'd</L>
<L>O'er erring Man the Year, and oft di&s;grac'd</L>
<L>The Pride of Schools, before their Cour&s;e was known</L>
<L>Full in its Cau&s;es and Effects to Him,</L>
<L>All-piercing Sage! Who &s;at not down and dreamt</L>
<L>Romantic Schemes, defended by the Din</L>
<L>Of &s;pecious Words, and Tyranny of Names,</L>
<L>But bidding his amazing Mind attend,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
And with heroick Patience Years on Years</L>
<L>Deep-&s;earching, &s;aw at la&s;t the Sy&s;tem dawn,</L>
<L>And &s;hine, of all his Race, on him alone.</L>
</LG>

<L>WHAT were his Raptures then! how pure! how &s;trong!</L>
<L>And what the Triumphs of old <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI></L>

<L>Stood all &s;ubdu'd by him, and open laid</L>
<L>Her every latent Glory to his View.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND fir&s;t our <HI>&s;olar Sy&s;tem</HI> he &s;urvey'd</L>
<L>With accurate Ken, and by the mingling Power</L>
<L>Of <HI>Gravitation</HI> and <HI>Projection</HI> &s;aw</L>
<L>The whole in &s;ilent Harmony revolve.</L>
<L>Drawn to his lengthen'd Eye th' attending <HI>Moons,</HI></L>

Or waxing broad with her pale &s;hadowy Light</L>
