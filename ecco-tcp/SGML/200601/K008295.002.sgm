<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have hitherto delayed the per|formance of the promi&s;e, by which you gave us rea&s;on to hope for ano|ther paper upon matrimony, I imagine you de&s;irous of collecting more materials than your own experience, or ob&s;ervation, can &s;upply; and I &s;hall therefore lay candidly before you an account of my own entrance into the con|jugal &s;tate.</P>
<P>I WAS about eight and twenty years old, when, having tried the diver&s;ions of the town till I began to be weary, and being awakened into &s;ome attention to more &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
by the failure of an attorney to whom I had implicitly tru&s;ted the conduct of my fortune, I re&s;olved to take my e&s;tate into my own care, and methodi&s;e my whole life according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of oeconomical prudence.</P>
<P>IN per&s;uance of this &s;cheme, I took leave of my acquaintance, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with numberle&s;s je&s;ts upon my new &s;y&s;tem; but fir&s;t endeavoured to divert me from a de&s;ign &s;o lit|tle worthy of a man of wit, by ridiculous ac|counts of the ignorance and ru&s;ticity into which many had &s;unk in their retirement, af|ter having di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for &s;ome years in taverns and play-hou&s;es, and given hopes of ri&s;ing to uncommon eminence among the gay part of mankind.</P>
<P>WHEN I came fir&s;t into the country, which, by a neglect not uncommon among young heirs, I had never &s;een &s;ince the death of my father, I found every thing in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that, being utterly without practice in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, I had great difficulties to encounter in di&s;entangling the perplexity of my circum&s;tan|ces; they however, at la&s;t, gave way to dili|gent application, and I &s;oon perceived that the advantage of keeping my own accounts
<PB N="3" REF="4">
would very much over-balance the time which they could require.</P>
<P>I HAD now vi&s;ited all my tenants, &s;urveyed all my land, and repaired the old hou&s;e, which, for &s;ome years, had been running to decay. The&s;e proofs of pecuniary wi&s;dom began to re|commend me, as a &s;ober, judicious, thriving gentleman, to all my graver neighbours of the country, who never failed to celebrate my management in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Thriftle&s;s</HI> and <HI>Latterwit,</HI> two &s;mart fellows, who had e&s;tates in the &s;ame part of the kingdom, which they vi&s;ited now and then in a frolick, to take up their rents beforehand, debauch a milk-maid, make a fea&s;t for the village, and tell &s;tories of their own intrigues, and then rode po&s;t back to town to &s;pend their money.</P>
<P>IT was doubtful, however, for &s;ome time, whether I &s;hould be able to hold my re&s;oluti|on; but a &s;hort per&s;everance removed all &s;u&s;|picions. I ro&s;e every day in reputation, by the decency of my conver&s;ation, and the regu|larity of my conduct, and was mentioned with great regard at the a&s;&s;izes, as a man very fit to be put in commi&s;&s;ion for the peace.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
DURING the confu&s;ion of my affairs, and the daily nece&s;&s;ity of vi&s;iting farms, adju&s;ting contracts, letting lea&s;es, and &s;uper-intending repairs, together with the civilities, which were at my fir&s;t arrival to be paid or returned, I found very little vacuity in my life, and therefore had not many thoughts of marriage; but, in a little while, the tumult of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ub&s;ided, and the exact method which I had e&s;tabli&s;hed, enabled me to di&s;patch my ac|counts with great facility; I had, therefore, now upon my hands, the ta&s;k of finding means to &s;pend my time, without falling back into the poor amu&s;ements which I had hither|to indulged, or changing them for the &s;ports of the field, which I &s;aw per&s;ued with &s;o much eagerne&s;s by the gentlemen of the country, that they were indeed the only plea&s;ures in which I could promi&s;e my&s;elf any partaker.</P>
<P>THE inconvenience of this &s;ituation natu|rally di&s;po&s;ed me to wi&s;h for a companion, and the known value of my e&s;tate, with my reputation for frugality and prudence, ea&s;ily gained me admi&s;&s;ion into every family; for I &s;oon &s;ound that no enquiry was made after any other virtue, nor any te&s;timonial nece&s;&s;a|ry,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
but, of my freedom from incumbrances, and my care of what they termed the <HI>main chance.</HI> I confe&s;s I could not &s;ee, without &s;ome indignation, the eagerne&s;s with which the daughters, wherever I came, were &s;et out to &s;how; nor could I con&s;ider them in a &s;tate much different from pro&s;titution, when I found them ordered to play their airs before me, and to exhibit, by &s;ome &s;eeming chance, &s;peci|mens of their mu&s;ick, their work, or their hou&s;ewifery. No &s;ooner was I placed at table, than the young lady was called upon to pay me &s;ome civility or other; nor could I find means of e&s;caping, from either father or mo|ther, &s;ome account of their daughter's excel|lencies, with a declaration, that they were now leaving the world, and had no bu&s;ine&s;s on this &s;ide the grave, but to &s;ee their children happily di&s;po&s;ed of; that &s;he whom I had been plea&s;|ed to compliment at table, was indeed the chief plea&s;ure of their age, &s;o good, &s;o dutiful, &s;o great a relief to her mamma in the care of the hou&s;e, and &s;o much her pappa's favourite for her chearfulne&s;s and wit, that it would be with the la&s;t reluctance that they &s;hould part; but to a worthy gentleman in the neighbour|hood, whom they might often vi&s;it, they would not &s;o far con&s;ult their own gratification,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
as to refu&s;e her; and their tenderne&s;s &s;hould be &s;hewn in her fortune, when ever a &s;uitable &s;ettlement was propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS I knew the&s;e overtures not to proceed from any preference of me before another e|qually rich, I could not but look with pity on young per&s;ons condemned to be &s;et to auction, and made cheap by injudicious com|mendations; for how could they know them|&s;elves offered and rejected a hundred times, without &s;ome lo&s;s of that &s;oft elevation, and maiden dignity, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of female excellence?</P>
<P>I SHALL not trouble you with a hi&s;tory of the &s;tratagems practi&s;ed upon my judgment, or the allurements tried upon my heart, which, if you have, in any part of your life, been ac|quainted with rural politicks, you will ea&s;ily conceive. Their arts have no great variety, they think nothing worth their care but mo|ney, and &s;uppo&s;ing its influence the &s;ame upon all the world, &s;eldom endeavour to deceive by any other means than fal&s;e computations.</P>
<P>I WILL not deny that, by hearing my&s;elf loudly commended for my di&s;cretion, I began
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to &s;et &s;ome value upon my character, and was unwilling to lo&s;e my credit by marrying for love. I therefore re&s;olved to know the for|tune of the lady whom I &s;hould addre&s;s, before I enquired after her wit, delicacy, or beauty.</P>
<P>THIS determination led me to Miti&s;&s;a, the daughter of Chry&s;ophilus, who&s;e per&s;on was at lea&s;t without deformity, and who&s;e manners were free from reproach, as &s;he had been bred up at a di&s;tance from all common temptations. To Miti&s;&s;a, therefore, I obtained leave from her parents to pay my court, and was referred by her again to her father, who&s;e direction &s;he was re&s;olved to follow. The que&s;tion then was, only, what &s;hould be &s;ettled. The old gentleman made an enormous demand, with which I refu&s;ed to comply. Miti&s;&s;a was or|dered to exert her power; &s;he told me, that if I could refu&s;e her papa, I had no love for her; that &s;he was an unhappy creature, and that I was a perfidious man: then &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and fell into fits. All this, as I was no pa&s;&s;ionate lover, had little effect. She next refu&s;ed to &s;ee me, and becau&s;e I thought my|&s;elf obliged to write in terms of di&s;tre&s;s, they had once hopes of &s;tarving me into mea&s;ures; but finding me inflexible, the father complied;
<PB N="8" REF="9">
with my propo&s;al, and told me he liked me the more for being &s;o good at a bargain.</P>
<P>I WAS now married to Miti&s;&s;a, and was to experience the happine&s;s of a match made without pa&s;&s;ion. Miti&s;&s;a &s;oon di&s;covered, that &s;he was equally prudent with my&s;elf, and had taken a hu&s;band only to be at her own command, and to have a chariot at her own call. She brought with her an old maid re|commended by her mother, who taught her all the arts of dome&s;tick management, and was, on every occa&s;ion, her chief agent and directre&s;s. They &s;oon invented one rea&s;on or other, to quarrel with all my &s;ervants, and either prevailed on me to turn them away, or treated them &s;o ill, they left me of them&s;elves, and always &s;upplied their places with &s;ome brought from her own relations. Thus they e&s;tabli&s;hed a family, over which I had no au|thority, and which was in a perpetual con&s;pi|racy again&s;t me; for Miti&s;&s;a con&s;idered her&s;elf as having a &s;eparate intere&s;t, and thought no|thing her own, but what &s;he laid up without my knowledge. For this rea&s;on &s;he brought me fal&s;e accounts of the expences of the hou&s;e, joined with my tenants in complaints of hard times, and by means of a &s;teward of
<PB N="9" REF="10">
her own, took rewards for &s;oliciting abate|ments of the rent. Her great hope is to out|live me, that &s;he may enjoy what &s;he has thus accumulated, and therefore &s;he is always con|triving &s;ome improvements of her jointure land, and once tried to procure an injunction to hinder me from felling timber upon it for repairs. Her father and mother a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her projects, and are frequently hinting that &s;he is ill u&s;ed, and reproaching me with the pre&s;ents that other ladies receive from their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>SUCH, Sir, was my &s;ituation for &s;even years, till at la&s;t my patience was exhau&s;ted, and ha|ving one day invited her father to my hou&s;e, I laid the &s;tate of my affairs before him, detect|ed my wife in &s;everal of her frauds, turned out her &s;teward, charged a con&s;table with her maid, took my bu&s;ine&s;s in my own hands, re|duced her to a &s;ettled allowance, and now write this account to warn others again&s;t mar|rying tho&s;e whom they have no rea&s;on to e&s;teem.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carcely any &s;pecies of poetry, that has allured more readers, or exci|ted more writers, than the pa&s;toral. It is ge|nerally plea&s;ing, becau&s;e it entertains the mind with repre&s;entations of &s;cenes familiar to al|mo&s;t every imagination, and of which all can equally judge whether they are well de&s;cribed. It exhibits a life, to which we have been al|ways accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ociate peace, and lei&s;ure, and innocence: and therefore we readily &s;et open the heart, for the admi&s;&s;ion of its images, which contribute to drive away cares and per|turbations, and &s;uffer our&s;elves, without re|&s;i&s;tance, to be tran&s;ported to ely&s;ian regions, where we are to meet with nothing but joy, and plenty, and contentment; where every gale whi&s;pers plea&s;ure, and every &s;hade promi|&s;es repo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT has been maintained by &s;ome, who love to talk of what they do not know, that pa&s;to|ral
<PB N="11" REF="12">
is the mo&s;t antient poetry; and, indeed, &s;ince it is probable, that poetry is nearly of the &s;ame antiquity with rational nature, and &s;ince the life of the fir&s;t men was certainly rural, we may rea&s;onably conjecture, that, as their ideas would nece&s;&s;arily be borrowed from tho&s;e objects with which they were acquainted, their compo&s;ures, being filled chiefly with &s;uch thoughts on the vi&s;ible creation as mu&s;t occur to the fir&s;t ob&s;ervers, were pa&s;toral hymns, like tho&s;e which <HI>Milton</HI> introduces the original pair &s;inging, in the day of innocence, to the prai&s;e of their maker.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on that pa&s;toral poetry was the fir&s;t employment of the human imagi|nation, it is generally the fir&s;t literary amu&s;e|ment of our minds. We have &s;een fields, and meadows, and groves from the time that our eyes opened upon life; and are plea&s;ed with birds, and brooks, and breezes, much earlier than we engage among the actions and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind. We are therefore delighted with rural pictures, becau&s;e we know the original at an age when our curio&s;ity can be very little awakened, by de&s;criptions of courts which we never beheld, or repre&s;entati|ons of pa&s;&s;ion which we never felt.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
THE &s;atisfaction received from this kind of writing not only begins early, but la&s;ts long; we do not throw it away among other childi&s;h amu&s;ements and pa&s;times as we advance into the intellectual world, but willingly return to it in any hour of indolence and relaxation. The images of true pa&s;toral have always the power of exciting delight, becau&s;e the works of nature, from which they are drawn, have always the &s;ame order and beauty, and conti|nue to force them&s;elves upon our thoughts, being at once obvious to the mo&s;t carele&s;s re|gard, and more than adequate to the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on, and &s;evere&s;t contemplation. Our in|clination to &s;tillne&s;s and tranquillity is &s;eldom much le&s;&s;ened by long knowledge of the bu&s;y and tumultuary part of the world. In child|hood we turn our thoughts to the country, as to the region of plea&s;ure, we recur to it in old age as a port of re&s;t, and perhaps with that &s;econdary and adventitious gladne&s;s, which every man feels on reviewing tho&s;e places, or recollecting tho&s;e occurrences, that contribut|ed to his youthful enjoyments, and bring him back to the prime of life, when the world was gay with the bloom of novelty, when
<PB N="13" REF="14">
mirth wantoned at his &s;ide, and hope &s;parkled before him.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of this univer&s;al plea&s;ure has in|vited numbers without number to try their &s;kill in pa&s;toral performances, in which they have generally &s;ucceeded after the manner of other imitators, tran&s;mitting the &s;ame images in the &s;ame combination from one to another, till he that reads the title of a poem, may gue&s;s at the whole &s;eries of the compo&s;ition; nor will a man, after the peru&s;al of thou&s;ands of the&s;e performances, find his knowledge enlarged with a &s;ingle view of nature not produced be|fore, or his imagination amu&s;ed with any new application of tho&s;e views to moral purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE range of pa&s;toral is indeed narrow, for though nature it&s;elf, philo&s;ophically con&s;i|dered, be inexhau&s;tible, yet its general effects on the eye and on the ear are uniform, and incapable of much variety of de&s;cription. Poetry cannot dwell upon the minuter di&s;tinc|tions, by which one &s;pecies differs from ano|ther, without departing from that &s;implicity of grandeur which fills the imagination; nor diffect the latent qualities of things, without
<PB N="14" REF="15">
lo&s;ing its general power of gratifying every mind by recalling its conceptions. However, as each age makes &s;ome di&s;coveries, and tho&s;e di&s;coveries are by degrees generally known, as new plants or modes of culture are introdu|ced, and by little and little become common, pa&s;toral might receive, from time to time, &s;mall augmentations, and exhibit once in a century a &s;cene &s;omewhat varied.</P>
<P>BUT pa&s;toral &s;ubjects have been often, like others, taken into the hands of tho&s;e that were not qualified to adorn them, men to whom the face of nature was &s;o little known, that they have drawn it only after their own imagination, and changed or di&s;torted her fea|tures, that their portraits might appear &s;ome|thing more than &s;ervile copies from their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>NOT only the images of rural life, but the occa&s;ions on which they can be properly pro|duced, are few and general. The &s;tate of a man confined to the employments and plea|&s;ures of the country, is &s;o little diver&s;ified, and expo&s;ed to &s;o few of tho&s;e accidents which produce perplexities, terrors and &s;urpri&s;es, in more complicated tran&s;actions, that he can be
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;hewn but &s;eldom in &s;uch circum&s;tances as at|tract curio&s;ity. His ambition is without poli|cy, and his love without intrigue. He has no complaints to make of his rival, but that he is richer than him&s;elf; nor any di&s;a&s;ters to la|ment, but a cruel mi&s;tre&s;s, or a bad harve&s;t.</P>
<P>THE conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome new &s;ource of plea&s;ure induced <HI>Sannazarius</HI> to &s;ub&s;titute fi&s;hermen for &s;hepherds, to re|move the &s;cene from the fields to the &s;ea, and derive his &s;entiments from the pi&s;catory life; for which he has been cen&s;ured by &s;ucceeding criticks, becau&s;e the &s;ea is an object of terrour, and by no means proper to amu&s;e the mind, and lay the pa&s;&s;ions a&s;leep. Again&s;t this ob|jection he might be defended by the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that the poet has a right to &s;elect his images, and is no more obliged to &s;hew the &s;ea in a &s;torm, than the land under an inun|dation; but may di&s;play all the plea&s;ures, and conceal the dangers, of the water, as he may lay his &s;hepherd under a &s;hady beech, without giving him an ague, or letting a wild bea&s;t loo&s;e upon him.</P>
<P>THERE are however two defects in the pi&s;|catory eclogue, which perhaps cannot be &s;up|plied.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
The &s;ea, though in hot countries it is con&s;idered by tho&s;e who live, like <HI>Sannazari|us,</HI> upon the coa&s;t, as a place of plea&s;ure and diver&s;ion, has notwith&s;tanding much le&s;s va|riety than the land, and therefore will be &s;oon|er exhau&s;ted by a de&s;criptive writer. When he has once &s;hewn the &s;un ri&s;ing or &s;etting upon it, curled its waters with the vernal breeze, rolled the waves in gentle &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the &s;hore, and enumerated the fi&s;h &s;porting in the &s;hallows, he has nothing remaining but what is common to all other poetry, the complaint of a nymph for a drowned lover, or the indignation of a fi&s;her that his oy&s;ters are refu&s;ed, and Mycon's accepted.</P>
<P>ANOTHER ob&s;tacle to the general reception of this kind of poetry, is the ignorance of maritime plea&s;ures, in which the greater part of mankind mu&s;t always live. To all the in|land inhabitants of every region, the &s;ea is only known as an immen&s;e diffu&s;ion of wa|ters, over which men pa&s;s from one country to another, and in which life is frequently lo&s;t. They have, therefore, no opportunity of tracing, in their own thoughts, the de&s;criptions of winding &s;hores, and calm bays, nor can look on the poem in which they are mentio|ned,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
with other &s;en&s;ations, than on a &s;ea-chart, or the metrical geography of <HI>Diony&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>THIS defect <HI>Sannazarius</HI> was hindered from perceiving, by writing in a learned lan|guage to readers generally acquainted with the works of nature; but if he had made his attempt in any vulgar tongue, he would &s;oon have di&s;covered how vainly he had endeavour|ed to make that loved, which was not un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>I AM afraid it will not be found ea&s;y to im|prove the pa&s;torals of antiquity, by any great additions or diver&s;ifications. Our de&s;criptions may indeed differ from tho&s;e of Virgil, as an Engli&s;h from an Italian &s;ummer, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as modern from antient life; but as nature is in both countries nearly the &s;ame, and as poetry has to do rather with the pa&s;&s;ions of men, which are uniform, than their cu&s;|toms, which are changeable, the varieties, which time or place can furni&s;h, will be in|con&s;iderable: and I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, in the next paper, how little the latter ages have contributed to the improvement of the ru&s;tick mu&s;e.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN writing or judging of pa&s;toral poetry, neither the authors nor criticks of latter times &s;eem to have paid &s;ufficient regard to the originals left us by antiquity, but have en|tangled them&s;elves with unnece&s;&s;ary difficul|ties, by advancing principles, which, having no foundation in the nature of things, are wholly to be rejected from a &s;pecies of compo|&s;ition in which, above all others, mere nature is to be regarded.</P>
<P>IT is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to enquire af|ter &s;ome more di&s;tinct and exact idea of this kind of writing. This may, I think, be ea&s;i|ly found in the pa&s;torals of Virgil, from who&s;e opinion it will not appear very &s;afe to depart, if we con&s;ider that every advantage of nature, and of fortune, concurred to complete his pro|ductions; that he was born with great accura|cy and &s;everity of judgment, enlightened
<PB N="19" REF="20">
with all the learning of one of the brighte&s;t a|ges, and embelli&s;hed with the elegance of the Roman court; that he employed his powers rather in improving, than inventing, and therefore mu&s;t have endeavoured to recom|pen&s;e the want of novelty by exactne&s;s; that taking Theocritus for his original, he found pa&s;toral far advanced towards perfection, and that having &s;o great a rival, he mu&s;t have pro|ceeded with uncommon caution.</P>
<P>IF we &s;earch the writings of Virgil, for the true definition of a pa&s;toral, it will be found <HI>a poem in which any action or pa&s;&s;ion is repre&s;ent|ed by its effects upon a country life.</HI> What&s;oe|ver therefore may, according to the common cour&s;e of things, happen in the country, may afford a &s;ubject for a pa&s;toral poet.</P>
<P>IN this definition, it will immediately occur to tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the writings of the modern criticks, that there is no mention of the golden age. I cannot indeed ea&s;ily di&s;co|ver why it is thought nece&s;&s;ary to refer de&s;crip|tions of a rural &s;tate to remote times, nor can I perceive that any writer has con&s;i&s;tently pre|&s;erved the Arcadian manners and &s;entiments. The only rea&s;on, that I have read, on which

this rule has been &s;ounded, is, that, according to the cu&s;toms of modern life, it is improba|ble that &s;hepherds &s;hould be capable of harmo|nious numbers, or delicate &s;entiments; and therefore the reader mu&s;t exalt his ideas of the pa&s;toral character, by carrying his thoughts back to the age in which the care of herds and flocks was the employment of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t men.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;oners &s;eem to have been led in|to their hypothe&s;is, by con&s;idering pa&s;toral, not in general, as a repre&s;entation of rural na|ture, and con&s;equently as exhibiting the ideas and &s;entiments of tho&s;e, whoever they are, to whom the country affords, plea&s;ure or em|ployment, but &s;imply as a dialogue, or narra|tive of men actually tending &s;heep, and bu&s;ied in the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t laborious offices; from whence they very readily concluded, &s;ince characters mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be pre&s;erved, that either the &s;entiments mu&s;t &s;ink to the level of the &s;peakers, or the &s;peakers mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to the height of the &s;entiments.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e original errors, a thou&s;and precepts have been given, which have only contributed to perplex and to con|found.
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Some have thought it nece&s;&s;ary that the imaginary manners of the golden age &s;hould be univer&s;ally pre&s;erved, and have there|fore believed, that nothing more could be ad|mitted in pa&s;toral, than lilies and ro&s;es, and rocks and &s;treams, among which are heard the gentle whi&s;pers of cha&s;te fondne&s;s, or the &s;oft complaints of amorous impatience. In pa&s;toral, as in other writings, cha&s;tity of &s;en|timent ought doubtle&s;s to be ob&s;erved, and purity of manners to be repre&s;ented; not be|cau&s;e the poet is confined to the images of the golden age, but becau&s;e, having the &s;ubject in his own choice, he ought always to con&s;ult the intere&s;t of virtue.</P>
<P>THESE advocates for the golden age lay down other principles, not very con&s;i&s;tent with their general plan; for they tell us, that, to &s;upport the character of the &s;hepherd, it is proper that all refinement &s;hould be avoided, and that &s;ome &s;light in&s;tances of ignorance &s;hould be inter&s;per&s;ed. Thus the &s;hepherd in Virgil is &s;uppo&s;ed to have forgot the name of Anaximander, and in Pope the term Zodiack is too hard for a ru&s;tick apprehen&s;ion. But if we place our &s;hepherds in their primitive condition, we may give them learning among
<PB N="22" REF="23">
their other qualifications; and if we &s;uffer them to allude at all to things of later exi&s;t|ence, which, perhaps, cannot with any great propriety be allowed, there can be no danger of making them &s;peak with too much accu|racy, &s;ince they conver&s;ed with divinities, and tran&s;mitted to &s;ucceeding ages the arts of life.</P>
<P>OTHER writers, having the mean and de|&s;picable condition of a &s;hepherd always before them, conceive it nece&s;&s;ary to degrade the lan|guage of pa&s;toral, by ob&s;olete terms and ru&s;|tick words, which they very learnedly call Dorick, without reflecting, that they thus be|come authors of a mingled dialect, which no human being ever could have &s;poken, that they may as well refine the &s;peech as the &s;en|timents of their per&s;onages, and that none of the incon&s;i&s;tencies which they endeavour to avoid, is greater than that of joining elegance of thought with coar&s;ene&s;s of diction. Spen&s;er begins one of his pa&s;torals with &s;tudied bar|barity; <Q><L><HI>Diggon Davie,</HI> I bid her good-day:</L>
<L>Or, <HI>Diggon</HI> her is, or I mi&s;&s;ay.</L>
<L><HI>Dig.</HI> Her was her while it was day-light,</L>
<L>But now her is a mo&s;t wretched wight.</L></Q><PB N="23" REF="24">
What will the reader imagine to be the &s;ub|ject on which &s;peakers like the&s;e exerci&s;e their eloquence? Will he not be &s;omewhat di&s;ap|pointed, when he finds them met together to condemn the corruptions of the church of Rome? Surely, at the &s;ame time that a &s;hep|herd learns theology, he may gain &s;ome ac|quaintance with his native language.</P>
<P>PASTORAL admits of all ranks of per&s;ons, becau&s;e per&s;ons of all ranks inhabit the coun|try. It excludes not, therefore, on account of the characters nece&s;&s;ary to be introduced, any elevation or delicacy of &s;entiment; tho&s;e ideas only are improper, which, not owing their original to rural objects, are not pa&s;toral. Such is the exclamation in Virgil. <Q><L>Nunc &s;cio quid &s;it Amor, duris in cautibus illum</L>

<L>Nec generis no&s;tri puerum nec &s;anguinis, edunt;</L></Q> which Pope endeavouring to copy, was car|ried to &s;till greater impropriety. <Q><L>I know thee, Love, wild as the raging main,</L>
<L>More fierce than tigers on the Libyan plain;</L>

in nature, are indeed of little value in any poem, but in pa&s;toral they are particularly li|able to cen&s;ure, becau&s;e they want that exalta|tion above common life, which in tragick or heroick writings often reconciles us to bold flights and daring figures.</P>
<P>PASTORAL being the <HI>repre&s;entation of an action or pa&s;&s;ion, by its effects upon a country life,</HI> has nothing peculiar but its confinement to rural imagery, without which it cea&s;es to be pa&s;toral. This is its true characteri&s;tick, and this it cannot lo&s;e by any dignity of &s;enti|ment, or beauty of diction. The Pollio of Virgil, with all its elevation, is a compo&s;ition truly bucolic, though rejected by the criticks; for all the images are either taken from the country, or from the religion of the age com|mon to all parts of the empire.</P>
<P>The Silenus is indeed of a more di&s;putable kind, becau&s;e though the &s;cene lies in the country, the &s;ong being religious and hi&s;tori|cal, had been no le&s;s adapted to any other au|dience or place.

<P>IT &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, to the perfection of this poem, that the occa&s;ion which is &s;uppo&s;ed to produce it, be at lea&s;t not incon&s;i&s;tent with a country life, or le&s;s likely to intere&s;t tho&s;e who have retired into places of &s;olitude and quiet, than the more bu&s;y part of mankind. It is therefore improper to give the title of a pa&s;toral to ver&s;es, in which the &s;peakers, af|ter the &s;light mention of their flocks, fall to complaints of errors in the church, and cor|ruptions in the government, or to lamentati|ons of the death of &s;ome illu&s;trious per&s;on, whom when once the poet has called a &s;hep|herd, he has no longer any labour upon his hands, but can make the clouds weep, and lilies wither, and the &s;heep hang their heads, without art or learning, genius or &s;tudy.</P>
<P>IT is part of Claudian's character of his ru&s;|tick, that he computes his time not by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of con&s;uls, but of harve&s;ts.

THE facility of treating actions or events in the pa&s;toral &s;tile has incited many writers, from whom more judgment might have been expected, to put the &s;orrow or the joy which the occa&s;ion required into the mouth of Daphne or of Thyr&s;is, and as one ab&s;urdity mu&s;t natu|rally be expected to make way for another, they have written with an utter di&s;regard both of life and nature, and filled their productions with mythological allu&s;ions, with incredible fictions, and with &s;entiments which neither pa&s;&s;ion nor rea&s;on could have dictated, &s;ince the change which religion has made in the whole &s;y&s;tem of the world.</P>

<P>THUS the maxim of Cleobulus the Lindi|an, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Mediocrity is be&s;t,</HI> has been long con&s;idered as an univer&s;al principle, ex|tended through the whole compa&s;s of life and nature.

<P>EVEN the gifts of nature, which may truly be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;olid and durable of all terre&s;trial advantages, are &s;ound, when they exceed the middle point, to be no very certain cau&s;es of felicity, but to draw the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or into many calamities, ea&s;ily avoided by others that have been le&s;s bountifully enriched or adorned. We &s;ee every day women pe|ri&s;hing with in&s;amy, by having been too will|ing

to &s;et their beauty to &s;how, and others, though not with equal guilt or mi&s;ery, yet with very &s;harp remor&s;e, langui&s;hing in decay, neglect, and ob&s;curity, for having rated their youthful charms at too high a price. And, indeed, if the opinion of Bacon be thought to de&s;erve much regard, very few &s;ighs would be vented for eminent and &s;uperlative elegance of form; "for beautiful women," &s;ays he, "are &s;eldom of any great accompli&s;hments, becau&s;e they, for the mo&s;t part, &s;tudy be|haviour rather than virtue."</P>
<P>HEALTH and vigour, and a happy con&s;ti|tution of the corporeal frame, are, to a com|mon degree, of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to the en|joyment of the comforts, and to the perfor|mance of the duties of life, and requi&s;ite in yet a greater mea&s;ure to the accompli&s;hment of any thing illu&s;trious or di&s;tingui&s;hed; yet even the&s;e, if we can judge by their apparent con&s;e|quences, are &s;ometimes not very beneficial to tho&s;e on whom they are mo&s;t liberally be&s;tow|ed. They that frequent the chambers of the &s;ick, will generally find the &s;harpe&s;t pains, and mo&s;t &s;tubborn maladies among them whom confidence of the force of nature for|merly betrayed to negligence and irregularity;
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and that &s;uperfluity of &s;trength, which was at once their boa&s;t and their &s;nare, has often, in the latter part of life, no other effect than that it continues them long in impotence and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>THESE gifts of nature are, however, al|ways ble&s;&s;ings in them&s;elves, and to be ac|knowledged with gratitude to him that gives them; &s;ince they are, in their regular and le|gitimate effects, productive of happine&s;s, and prove pernicious only by voluntary corruption, or idle negligence. And as there is little dan|ger of per&s;uing them with too much ardour or anxiety, becau&s;e no &s;kill or diligence can hope to procure them, the uncertainty of their influence upon our lives is mentioned, not to depreciate their real value, but to re|pre&s;s the di&s;content and envy to which the want of them often gives occa&s;ion in tho&s;e who do not enough &s;u&s;pect their own frailty, nor con&s;ider how much le&s;s is the calamity of not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great powers, than of not u&s;ing them aright.</P>
<P>OF all tho&s;e things that make us &s;uperior to others, there is none &s;o much within the reach of our endeavours as riches, nor any
<PB N="30" REF="31">
thing more eagerly or con&s;tantly de&s;ired. Poverty is an evil always in our view, an e|vil complicated with &s;o many circum&s;tances of unea&s;ine&s;s and vexation, that every man is &s;tudious to avoid it. Some degree of riches is therefore required, that we may be exempt from the gripe of nece&s;&s;ity; when this pur|po&s;e is once attained, we naturally wi&s;h for more, that the evil which is regarded with &s;o much horror may be yet at a greater di&s;tance from us; as he that has once felt or dreaded the paw of a &s;avage, will not be at re&s;t till they are parted by &s;ome barrier, which may take away all po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;econd attack.</P>
<P>TO this point, if fear be not unrea&s;onably indulged, Cleobulus would, perhaps, not re|fu&s;e to extend his mediocrity. But it almo&s;t always happens, that the man who grows rich changes his notions of poverty, &s;tates his wants by &s;ome new mea&s;ure, and from flying the enemy that per&s;ued him, bends his endea|vours to overtake tho&s;e whom he &s;ees before him. The power of gratifying his appetites encrea&s;es their demands; a thou&s;and wi&s;hes croud in upon him importunate to be &s;atisfied, and vanity and ambition open pro&s;pects to de|&s;ire,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
which &s;till grow wider, as they are more contemplated.</P>
<P>THUS in time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> enlarged without bounds; an eagerne&s;s for increa&s;e of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions deluges the &s;oul, and we &s;ink into the gulphs of in&s;atiability, only becau&s;e we do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider, that all real need is very &s;oon &s;upplied, and all real danger of its inva&s;ion ea&s;ily precluded; that the claims of vanity, being without limits, mu&s;t be denied at la&s;t; and that, perhaps, the pain of repre&s;|&s;ing them is le&s;s pungent before they have been long accu&s;tomed to comphance.</P>
<P>WHOSOEVER &s;hall look heedfully upon tho&s;e who are eminent for their riches, will not think their condition &s;uch as that he &s;hould hazard his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and much le&s;s his virtue to obtain it. For all that great wealth generally gives above a moderate fortune, is more room for the freaks of caprice, and more privilege for ignorance and vice, a quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of flatteries, and a larger circle of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is one rea&s;on &s;eldom remarked which makes riches le&s;s de&s;irable. Too much

wealth is very frequently the occa&s;ion of po|verty.

<P>WHEN the plains of India were burnt up by a long continuance of drought, Hamet and Ra&s;chid, two neighbouring &s;hepherds, faint with thir&s;t, &s;tood at the common boundary of their grounds, with their flocks and herds panting round them, and in extremity of di&s;|tre&s;s prayed for water. On a &s;udden the air was becalmed, the birds cea&s;ed to chirp, and the flocks to bleat. They turned their eyes every way, and &s;aw a being of mighty &s;tature advancing through the valley, whom they know upon his nearer approach to be the Ge|nius of di&s;tribution. In one hand he held the &s;heaves of plenty, and in the other the &s;abre of de&s;truction. The &s;hepherds &s;tood trem|bling,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
and would have retired before him; but he called to them with a voice gentle as the breeze that plays in the evening among the &s;pices of Sabaea; "Fly not from your bene|factor, children of the du&s;t! I am come to offer you gifts, which only your own folly can make vain. You here pray for water, and water I will be&s;tow; let me know with how much you will be &s;atisfied: &s;peak not ra&s;hly; con&s;ider, that of whatever can be enjoyed by the body, exce&s;s is no le&s;s dangerous than &s;carcity. When you re|member the pain of thir&s;t, do not forget the danger of &s;uffocation. Now, Hamet, tell me your reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"O BEING, kind and beneficent," &s;ays Hamet, "let thine eye pardon my confu&s;ion. I entreat a little brook, which in &s;ummer &s;hall never be dry, and in winter never overflow." "It is granted," replies the Genius; and immediately he opened the ground with his &s;abre, and a fountain bub|bling up under their feet &s;cattered its rills over the meadows; the flowers renewed their fragrance, the trees &s;pread a greener foliage, and the flocks and herds quenched their thir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
THEN turning to Ra&s;chid, the Genius in|vited him likewi&s;e to offer his petition. "I reque&s;t, &s;ays Ra&s;chid, that thou wilt turn the Ganges through my grounds, with all his waters, and all their inhabitants." Ha|met was &s;truck with the greatne&s;s of his neigh|bour's &s;entiments, and &s;ecretly repined in his heart, that he had not made the &s;ame petition before him; when the Genius &s;poke, "Ra&s;h man, be not in&s;atiable! remember, to thee that is nothing which thou can&s;t not u&s;e; and how are thy wants greater than the wants of Hamet?" Ra&s;chid repeated his de&s;ire, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the mean ap|pearance that Hamet would make in the pre|&s;ence of the proprietor of the Ganges. The Genius then retired towards the river, and the two &s;hepherds &s;tood waiting the event. As Ra&s;|chid was looking with contempt upon his neighbour, on a &s;udden was heard the roar of torrents, and they found by the mighty &s;tream that the mounds of the Ganges were broken. The flood rolled forward into the lands of Ra&s;chid, his plantations were torn up, his flocks overwhelmed, he was &s;wept away be|fore it, and a crocodile devoured him.</P>

<P>THE condition of the female &s;ex has been frequently the &s;ubject of compa&s;&s;ion to medical writers, becau&s;e their con&s;titution of body is &s;uch, that every &s;tate of life brings its peculiar di&s;ea&s;es: they are placed, according to the proverb, between Scylla and Charybdis, with no other choice than of dangers equally formidable; and whether they embrace mar|riage, or determine upon a &s;ingle life, are ex|po&s;ed, in con&s;equence of their choice, to &s;ick|ne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and death.</P>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed that &s;o great a degree of natural infelicity might not be increa&s;ed by adventitious and artificial mi&s;eries; and that beings who&s;e beauty we cannot behold with|out admiration, and who&s;e delicacy we can|not contemplate without tenderne&s;s, might be &s;uffered to enjoy every alleviation of their &s;or|rows. But, however it has happened, the cu&s;tom of the world &s;eems to have been formed ed in a kind of a con&s;piracy again&s;t them, tho
<PB N="36" REF="37">
it does not appear but they had them&s;elves an equal &s;hare in its e&s;tabli&s;hment; and pre&s;crip|tions which, by whom&s;oever they were be|gun, are now of very long continuance, and by con&s;equence of great authority, &s;eem to have almo&s;t excluded them from content, in what&s;oever condition they &s;hall pa&s;s their lives.</P>
<P>IF they refu&s;e the &s;ociety of men, and con|tinue in that &s;tate which is rea&s;onably &s;uppo|&s;ed to place happine&s;s mo&s;t in their own pow|er, they &s;eldom give tho&s;e that ob&s;erve their conduct, or frequent their conver&s;ation, any exalted notions of the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty; for, whether it be that they are angry to &s;ee with what incon&s;iderate eagerne&s;s the re&s;t of their &s;ex ru&s;hes into &s;lavery, or with what ab&s;urd va|nity the married ladies boa&s;t the change of their condition, and condemn the heroines who endeavour by their example to a&s;&s;ert the natural dignity of their &s;ex; whether they are con&s;cious that like barren countries they are free, only becau&s;e they were never thought to de&s;erve the trouble of a conque&s;t; or imagine that their &s;incerity is not always un&s;u&s;pected, when they declare their contempt for men; it is certain that they generally appear to have
<PB N="37" REF="38">
&s;ome great and ince&s;&s;ant cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, and that many of them have at la&s;t been per|&s;uaded, by powerful rhetoricians, to try the life which they had &s;o long contemned, and put on the bridal ornaments at a time when they lea&s;t became them.</P>
<P>WHAT are the real cau&s;es of the di&s;content and impatience which the ladies always di&s;co|ver in a virgin &s;tate, I &s;hall perhaps take &s;ome other occa&s;ion to examine. That it is by no means to be envied for its happine&s;s, appears from the &s;olicitude with which it is generally avoided; from the opinion univer&s;ally preva|lent among the &s;ex, that no woman continues long in it but becau&s;e &s;he is not invited to for|&s;ake it, and the di&s;po&s;ition which they always &s;hew to treat old maids as the refu&s;e of the world; and from the willingne&s;s with which it is often quitted at la&s;t, by tho&s;e who&s;e expe|rience has enabled them to judge at lei&s;ure, and decide with authority.</P>
<P>YET &s;uch is the condition of life, that whatever is propo&s;ed, it is much ea&s;ier to find rea&s;ons for avoiding than embracing. Mar|riage, though a certain &s;ecurity from the re|proach and &s;olitude of antiquated virginity,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
has yet, as it is u&s;ually conducted, many di&s;|advantages, which take away much from the plea&s;ure which &s;ociety promi&s;es, and which it might afford, if plea&s;ures and pains were ho|ne&s;tly &s;hared, and mutual confidence inviola|bly pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;eries, indeed, which many ladies &s;uffer under conjugal vexations, are to be con&s;idered with great pity, becau&s;e their hu&s;|bands are often not taken by them as objects of affection, but forced upon them by authori|ty and violence, or by per&s;ua&s;ion and impor|tunity, equally re&s;i&s;tle&s;s when urged by tho&s;e whom they have been always accu&s;tomed to reverence and obey; and it very &s;eldom ap|pears, that tho&s;e who are thus de&s;potick in the di&s;po&s;al of their children, pay any regard to their dome&s;tick and per&s;onal felicity, or think it &s;o much to be enquired whether they will be happy, as whether they will be rich.</P>
<P>IT may be urged, however, in extenuation of this crime, which parents, not in any other re&s;pect to be numbered with robbers and a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins, frequently commit, that, in their e&s;ti|mation, riches and happine&s;s are equivalent terms, and that having pa&s;&s;ed their lives with
<PB N="39" REF="40">
no other wi&s;h than that of adding acre to acre, and filling one bag after another, they imagine them&s;elves to have &s;ufficiently con&s;i|dered the advantage of a daughter, when they have &s;ecured her a large jointure, and given her rea&s;onable expectations of living in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e &s;atisfactions, with which &s;he had &s;een her father and mother &s;olacing their age.</P>
<P>THERE is an oeconomical oracle received among the prudential and grave part of the world, which advi&s;es fathers <HI>to marry their daughters le&s;t they &s;hould marry them&s;elves</HI>; by which I &s;uppo&s;e it is implied, that women left to their own conduct, generally unite them&s;elves with &s;uch partners as can contri|bute very little to their felicity.

<P>MELANTHIA came to town upon the death of her father, with a very large fortune, and with the reputation of a much larger: &s;he was therefore followed and care&s;&s;ed by many men of rank, and by &s;ome of under&s;tanding; but having an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of plea&s;ure, &s;he
<PB N="41" REF="42">
was not at lei&s;ure, from the park, the gar|dens, the theatres, vi&s;its, a&s;&s;emblies, and ma&s;querades, to attend &s;eriou&s;ly to any pro|po&s;al, but was &s;till impatient for a new flatter|er, and neglected marriage as always in her power; till in time her admirers fell away, &s;ome wearied with treating, others di&s;gu&s;ted with her folly, and others offended by her in|con&s;tancy; &s;he heard of concerts to which &s;he was not invited, and was more than once for|ced to &s;it &s;till at an a&s;&s;embly, for want of a partner. In this di&s;tre&s;s, chance threw in her way Philotryphus, a man vain, glittering, and thoughtle&s;s as her&s;elf, who had &s;pent a &s;mall fortune in equipage and dre&s;s, and was &s;hining in the la&s;t &s;uit for which his taylor would give him credit. He had been long endeavouring to retrieve his extravagance by marriage, and therefore &s;oon paid his court to Melanthia, who after &s;ome weeks of in&s;en&s;ibility at la&s;t &s;aw him at a ball, and was wholly overcome by his performance in a minuet. They mar|ried; but a man cannot always dance, and Philotryphus had no other method of plea&s;ing: however, as neither was in any great degree vitious, they live together with no greater un|happine&s;s, than vacuity of mind, and that ta&s;tele&s;&s;ne&s;s of life, which proceeds from a &s;a|tiety

of juvenile plea&s;ures, and an utter inabi|lity to fill their place by nobler and more &s;uita|ble employments.

<P>Argyris, after having refu&s;ed a thou&s;and of|fers from men equal in rank and fortune, at la&s;t con&s;ented to marry Cotylus, the younger brother of a duke, a man without elegance of mien, beauty of per&s;on, or force of under|&s;tanding; who, while he courted her, could not always forbear allu&s;ions to her birth, and hints how cheaply &s;he would purcha&s;e an al|liance to &s;o illu&s;trious a family. His conduct from the hour of his marriage has been in&s;uf|ferably tyrannical, nor has he any other regard to her than what ari&s;es from his de&s;ire that her appearance may not di&s;grace him. Upon this principle, however, he always orders that &s;he &s;hould be gaily dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;plendidly at|tended; and &s;he has, among all her mortifica|tions, the happine&s;s, which &s;he always de&s;i|red, of taking place of her elder &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>IT has been very frequently remarked, that authors are <HI>genus irritabile,</HI> a <HI>generation very ea&s;ily put out of temper,</HI> and that they &s;el|dom fail of giving proofs of their ira&s;cibility, upon the &s;lighte&s;t attack of critici&s;m, or the mo&s;t gentle or mode&s;t offer of advice and in|formation.</P>
<P>AS writers have generally been mo&s;t ac|quainted with one another, they have repre|&s;ented this character as chiefly prevailing among men of literature, which a more ex|ten&s;ive view of the world would have &s;hewn them to be diffu&s;ed through all human nature, to mingle it&s;elf with every &s;pecies of ambition, and de&s;ire of prai&s;e, and to di&s;cover its effects with greater or le&s;s re&s;traint, and under di&s;|gui&s;es more or le&s;s artful, in every place and in every condition.</P>

THE quarrels of writers, indeed, are more ob&s;erved, becau&s;e they nece&s;&s;arily appeal to the deci&s;ion of the publick. Their enmities are incited by applau&s;es from their parties, and prolonged by treacherous encouragement for general diver&s;ion; and when the conte&s;t hap|pens to ri&s;e high between men of genius and learning, its memory is continued for the &s;ame rea&s;on as its vehemence was at fir&s;t pro|moted, becau&s;e it gratifies the malevolence or curio&s;ity of readers, and relieves the vacan|cies of life with amu&s;ement and laughter. The per&s;onal di&s;putes, therefore, of rivals in wit are &s;ometimes tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, when the grudges and heart-burnings of men le&s;s con&s;picuous, though carried on with equal bitterne&s;s, and productive of greater evils, are expo&s;ed to the knowledge of tho&s;e only whom they nearly affect, and &s;uffered to pa&s;s off and be forgotten among common and ca&s;ual tran&s;|actions.</P>
<P>THE re&s;entment which the di&s;covery of a fault or folly produces, mu&s;t bear a certain proportion to our pride, and will regularly be more acrimonious as pride is more immedi|ately the principle of action. In whatever
<PB N="45" REF="46">
therefore we wi&s;h or imagine our&s;elves to ex|cel, we &s;hall always be di&s;plea&s;ed to have our claims to reputation di&s;puted, and generally more di&s;plea&s;ed, if the accompli&s;hment be &s;uch as can expect reputation only for its re|ward. For this rea&s;on it is common to find men break out into rage at any in&s;inuations to the di&s;advantage of their wit, who have born with great patience reflections on their morals; and of women it has been always known, that no cen&s;ure wounds &s;o deeply, or rankles &s;o long, as that which charges them with want of beauty.</P>
<P>AS men frequently fill their imaginations with trifling per&s;uits, and plea&s;e them&s;elves mo&s;t with things of &s;mall importance, I have often known very &s;evere and la&s;ting ma|levolence excited by unlucky cen&s;ures, which would have fallen without any effect, had they not happened to wound a part remarkably tender. Gu&s;tulus, who valued him&s;elf upon the nicety of his palate, di&s;inherited his elde&s;t &s;on for telling him that the wine, which he was then commending, was the &s;ame which he had &s;ent away the day before as not fit to be drunk. Proculus withdrew his kindne&s;s from a nephew, whom he had always con&s;idered as
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the mo&s;t promi&s;ing genius of the age, for hap|pening to prai&s;e in his pre&s;ence the graceful hor&s;eman&s;hip of Marius. And Fortunio, when he was privy coun&s;ellor, procured a clerk to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from one of the publick offices, in which he was eminent for his &s;kill and a&s;&s;idu|ity, becau&s;e he had been heard to &s;ay over a bottle, that there was another man in the kingdom, on who&s;e &s;kill at billiards he would lay his money again&s;t Fortunio's.</P>
<P>FELICIA and Floretta had been bred up in one hou&s;e, and &s;hared all the plea&s;ures and en|dearments of infancy together. They enter|ed upon life at the &s;ame time, and continued their confidence and friend&s;hip; con&s;ulted each other in every change of their dre&s;s, and every admi&s;&s;ion of a new lover; thought every di|ver&s;ion more entertaining whenever it hap|pened that both were pre&s;ent, and when &s;epa|rate ju&s;tified the conduct, and celebrated the excellencies of one another. Such was their intimacy, and &s;uch their fidelity; till a birth|night approached, when Floretta took one morning an opportunity, as they were con&s;ul|ting upon new cloaths, to advi&s;e her friend not to dance at the ball, and informed her that her performance the year before had not
<PB N="47" REF="48">
an&s;wered the expectation which her other ac|compli&s;hments had rai&s;ed. Felicia commend|ed her &s;incerity, and thanked her for the cau|tion; but told her that &s;he danced to plea&s;e her&s;elf, and was in very little concern what the men might take the liberty of &s;aying, but that if her appearance gave her dear Floretta any unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he would &s;tay away. Floretta had now nothing left but to make new pro|te&s;tations of &s;incerity and affection, with which Felicia was &s;o well &s;atisfied, that they parted with more than u&s;ual fondne&s;s. They &s;till continued to vi&s;it, with this only difference, that Felicia was more punctual than before, and often declared how high a value &s;he put upon &s;incerity, how much &s;he thought that goodne&s;s to be e&s;teemed which would venture to admoni&s;h a friend of an error, and with what gratitude advice was to be received, even when it might happen to proceed from mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IN a few months Felicia, with great &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, told Floretta, that though her beauty was &s;uch as gave charms to whatever &s;he did, and her qualifications &s;o exten&s;ive, that &s;he could not fail of excellence in any attempt, yet &s;he thought her&s;elf obliged by the duties of
<PB N="48" REF="49">
friend&s;hip to inform her, that if ever &s;he be|trayed want of judgment, it was by too fre|quent compliance with &s;olicitations to &s;ing, for that her manner was &s;omewhat ungraceful, and her voice had no great compa&s;s. It is true, &s;ays Floretta, when I &s;ung three nights ago at lady Sprightly's, I was hoar&s;e with a cold; but I &s;ing for my own &s;atisfaction, and am not in the lea&s;t pain whether I am liked. However, my dear Felicia's kindne&s;s is not the le&s;s, and I &s;hall always think my&s;elf hap|py in &s;o true a friend.</P>
<P>FROM this time, they never &s;aw each other without mutual profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem, and declarations of confidence, but went &s;oon af|ter into the country to vi&s;it their relations. When they came back, they were prevailed on, by the importunity of new acquaintance, to take lodgings in different parts of the town, and had frequent occa&s;ion when they met, to bewail the di&s;tance at which they were placed, and the uncertainty which each experienced of finding the other at home.</P>
<P>THUS are the fonde&s;t and firme&s;t friend|&s;hips di&s;&s;olved, by &s;uch openne&s;s, and &s;ince|rity, as interrupt our enjoyment of our own
<PB N="49" REF="50">
approbation, or recalls us to the remembrance of tho&s;e failings, which we are more willing to indulge than to correct.</P>
<P>IT is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to imagine, that he who is offended at advice, was igno|rant of the fault, and re&s;ents the admonition as a fal&s;e charge; for perhaps it is mo&s;t natu|ral to be enraged, when there is the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of our own guilt. While we can ea&s;ily defend our character, we are no more di&s;turbed at an accu&s;ation, than we are alarm|ed by an enemy whom we are &s;ure to conquer; and who&s;e attack, therefore, will bring us honour without danger. But when a man feels the reprehen&s;ion of a friend &s;econded by his own heart, he is ea&s;ily heated into re&s;ent|ment and revenge, either becau&s;e he hoped, that the fault of which he was con&s;cious had e&s;caped the notice of others; or that his friend had looked upon it with tenderne&s;s and exte|nuation, and excu&s;ed it for the &s;ake of his o|ther virtues; or had con&s;idered him as too wi&s;e to need advice, or too delicate to be &s;hocked with reproach: or, becau&s;e we can|not feel without pain tho&s;e reflections rou&s;ed, which we have been endeavouring to lay a|&s;leep; and when pain has produced anger,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
who would not willingly believe, that it ought to be di&s;charged on others, rather than on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE re&s;entment produced by &s;incerity, whatever be its immediate cau&s;e, is &s;o certain, and generally &s;o keen, that very few have magnanimity &s;ufficient for the practice of a duty, which, above mo&s;t others, expo&s;es its votaries to hard&s;hips and per&s;ecutions; yet friend&s;hip without it is of a very little value, &s;ince the great u&s;e of &s;o clo&s;e an intimacy is that our virtues may be guarded and encour|aged, and our vices repre&s;&s;ed in their fir&s;t ap|pearance by timely detection, and &s;alutary re|mon&s;trances.</P>
<P>IT is decreed by providence, that nothing truly valuable &s;hall be obtained in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, but with difficulty and danger. He that hopes for that plea&s;ure which is to be gained by an unre&s;trained communication of &s;enti|ments, mu&s;t dare to hazard, by unplea&s;ing truths, that regard which he a&s;pires to merit. The chief rule to be ob&s;erved in the exerci&s;e of this dangerous office, is to pre&s;erve it pure from all mixture of intere&s;t or vanity; to for|bear admonition or reproof, when our con|&s;ciences
<PB N="51" REF="52">
tell us that they are incited not by the hopes of reforming faults, but the de&s;ire of &s;hewing our di&s;cernment, or gratifying our own pride by the mortification of another. It is not indeed certain that the mo&s;t refined caution will find a proper time, for bringing a man to the knowledge of his own failings, or the mo&s;t zealous benevolence reconcile him to that judgment, by which they are detected; but he who endeavours only the happine&s;s of him whom he reproves, will always have either the &s;atisfaction of obtaining or de&s;erving kind|ne&s;s; if he &s;ucceeds, he benefits his friend, and if he fails, he has at lea&s;t the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he &s;uffers for only doing well.</P>

<P>SO few of the hours of life are filled up with objects adequate to the mind of man, and &s;o frequently are we in want of pre|&s;ent

plea&s;ure or employment, that we are for|ced to have recour&s;e every moment to the pa&s;t and future for &s;upplemental &s;atisfactions, and relieve the vacuities of our being, by recol|lection of former pa&s;&s;ages, or anticipation of events to come.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but con&s;ider this nece&s;&s;ity of &s;earching on every &s;ide for matter on which the attention may be employed, as a &s;trong proof of the &s;uperior and cele&s;tial nature of the &s;oul of man. We have no rea&s;on to believe that other creatures have higher faculties, or more exten&s;ive capacities, than the pre&s;ervati|on of them&s;elves, or of their &s;pecies, requires; they &s;eem always to be fully employed, or to be completely at ea&s;e without employ|ment, to feel few intellectual mi&s;eries or plea|&s;ures, and to have no exuberance of under|&s;tanding to lay out upon curio&s;ity or caprice, but to have their minds exactly adapted to their bodies, with few other ideas than &s;uch as corporal pain or plea&s;ure impre&s;s upon them.</P>
<P>OF memory, which makes &s;o large a part of the excellence of the human &s;oul, and which has &s;o much influence upon all its other
<PB N="53" REF="54">
powers, but a &s;mall portion has been allotted to the animal world. We do not find the grief, with which the dams lament the lo&s;s of their young, proportionate to the tenderne&s;s with which they care&s;s, the a&s;&s;iduity with which they feed, or the vehemence with which they defend them. Their regard for their offspring, when it is before their eyes, is not, in appearance, le&s;s than that of a hu|man parent; but when it is taken away, it is very &s;oon forgotten, and, after a &s;hort ab&s;ence, if brought again, wholly di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>THAT they have very little remembrance of any thing once out of the reach of their &s;en&s;es, and &s;earce any power of comparing the pre&s;ent with the pa&s;t, and regulating their conclu&s;ions from experience, may be gathered from this, that their intellects are produced in their full perfection. The &s;parrow that was hatched la&s;t &s;pring makes her fir&s;t ne&s;t the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, of the &s;ame materials, and with the &s;ame art, as in any following year; and the hen conducts and &s;helters her fir&s;t brood of chickens with all the prudence that &s;he ever attains.</P>
<P>IT has been a&s;ked by men who love to per|plex
<PB N="54" REF="55">
any thing that is plain to common under|&s;tandings, how rea&s;on differs from in&s;tinct; and Prior has with no great propriety made Solomon him&s;elf declare, that, to di&s;tingui&s;h them is <HI>the fool's ignorance, and the pedant's pride.</HI> To give an accurate an&s;wer to a que&s;|tion, of which the terms are not compleatly under&s;tood, is impo&s;&s;ible; we do not know in what either rea&s;on or in&s;tinct con&s;i&s;t, and therefore cannot tell with exactne&s;s how they differ; but &s;urely he that contemplates a &s;hip and a bird's ne&s;t, will not be long without finding out, that the idea of the one was im|pre&s;&s;ed at once, and continued through all the progre&s;&s;ive de&s;cents of the &s;pecies, without va|riation or improvement; and that the other is the re&s;ult of experiments compared with ex|periments, has grown, by accumulated ob&s;er|vations, from le&s;s to greater excellence, and exhibits the collective knowledge of different ages, and various profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>MEMORY is the purveyor of rea&s;on, the power which places tho&s;e images before the mind upon which the judgment is to be exer|ci&s;ed, and which trea&s;ures up the determinati|on, that are once pa&s;&s;ed, as the rules of future action, or grounds of &s;ub&s;equent conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
IT is, indeed, the faculty of remembrance, which may be &s;aid to place us in the cla&s;s of moral agents. If we were to act only in con|&s;equence of &s;ome immediate impul&s;e, and re|ceive no direction from internal motives of choice, we &s;hould be pu&s;hed forward by an invincible fatality, without power or rea&s;on for the mo&s;t part to prefer one thing to ano|ther, becau&s;e we could make no compari&s;on but of objects which might both happen to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>WE owe to memory not only the increa&s;e of our knowledge, and our progre&s;s in ratio|nal enquiries, but many other intellectual plea|&s;ures. Indeed, almo&s;t all that we can be &s;aid to enjoy is pa&s;t or future; the pre&s;ent is in perpetual motion, leaves us as &s;oon as it ar|rives, cea&s;es to be pre&s;ent before its pre&s;ence is well perceived, and is only known to have ex|i&s;ted by the effects which it leaves behind. The greate&s;t part of our ideas ari&s;es, there|fore, from the view before or behind us, and we are happy or mi&s;erable, according as we are affected by the &s;urvey of our life, or our pro&s;pect of future exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
WITH regard to futurity, when events are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, that we cannot take the whole concatenation into our view, we have generally power enough over our ima|gination to turn it upon plea&s;ing &s;cenes, and can promi&s;e our&s;elves riches, honours, and delights, without intermingling tho&s;e vexati|ons and anxieties, with which all human en|joyments are polluted. If fear breaks in on one &s;ide, and alarms us with dangers and di&s;appointments, we can call in hope on the other, to &s;olace us with rewards, and e&s;capes, and victories; &s;o that we are &s;eldom without means of palliating remote evils, and can ge|nerally &s;ooth our&s;elves to tranquillity, when|ever any trouble&s;ome pre&s;age happens to at|tack us.</P>
<P>IT is therefore, I believe, much more com|mon for the &s;olitary and thoughtful, to amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;chemes of the future, than reviews of the pa&s;t. For the future is pliant and ductile, and will be ea&s;ily moulded by a &s;trong fancy into any form. But the images which memory pre&s;ents are of a &s;tubborn and untractable nature, the objects of remem|brance have already exi&s;ted, and left their &s;ig|nature
<PB N="57" REF="58">
behind them impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind, &s;o as to defy all attempts of ra&s;ure, or of change.</P>
<P>AS the &s;atisfactions, therefore, ari&s;ing from memory are le&s;s arbitrary, they are more &s;o|lid, and are, indeed, the only joys which we can call our own. Whatever we have once repo&s;ited, as Dryden expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>in the &s;acred trea&s;ure of the pa&s;t,</HI> is out of the reach of ac|cident, or violence, nor can be lo&s;t either by our own weakne&s;s, or another's malice: <Q><L>&mdash;Non tamen irritum</L>

<L>Diffinget, infectumque reddet,</L>
<L>Quod &s;ugiens &s;emel hora vexit.</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE is certainly no greater happine&s;s, than to be able to look back on a life u&s;efully and virtuou&s;ly employed, to trace our own progre&s;s in exi&s;tence, by &s;uch tokens as excite neither &s;hame nor &s;orrow. Life, in which nothing has been done or &s;uffered to di&s;tin|gui&s;h one day from another, is to him that has pa&s;&s;ed it, as if it had never been, except that he is con&s;cious how ill he has hu&s;banded the great depo&s;it of his creator. Life, made me|morable by crimes, and diver&s;ified thro' its
<PB N="58" REF="59">
&s;everal periods by wickedne&s;s, is indeed ea&s;ily reviewed, but reviewed only with horror and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>THE great con&s;ideration which ought to in|fluence us in the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent moment, is to ari&s;e from the effect, which, as well or ill applied, it mu&s;t have upon the time to come; for though its actual exi&s;tence be in|conceivably &s;hort, yet its effects are unlimited, and there is not the &s;malle&s;t point of time but may extend its con&s;equences, either to our hurt or our advantage, through all eternity, and give us rea&s;on to remember it for ever, with angui&s;h or exultation.</P>
<P>THE time of life, in which memory &s;eems particularly to claim predominance over the other faculties of the mind, is our declining age. It has been remarked by former writers, that old men are generally narrative, and fall ea&s;ily into recitals of pa&s;t tran&s;actions, and accounts of per&s;ons known to them in their youth. When we approach the verge of the grave it is more eminently true; <Q>Vitae &s;umma brevis &s;pem nos vetat incloare longam.</Q>  We have no longer any po&s;&s;ibility of great vi|ci&s;&s;itudes
<PB N="59" REF="60">
in our favour; the changes which are to happen in the world will come too late for our accommodation; and tho&s;e who have no hope before them, and to whom their pre|&s;ent &s;tate is painful and irk&s;ome, mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity turn their thoughts back to try what retro&s;pect will afford. It ought, therefore, to be the care of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pa&s;s the la&s;t hours with comfort, to lay up &s;uch a trea&s;ure of plea&s;ing ideas, as &s;hall &s;upport the expen&s;es of that time, which is to depend wholly upon the fund already acquired. <Q><L>&mdash;Petite hine juvene&s;que &s;ene&s;que</L>

<P>IN youth, however unhappy, we &s;olace our&s;elves with the hope of better fortune, and, however vicious, appea&s;e our con&s;ciences with intentions of repentance; but the time comes at la&s;t, in which life has no more to promi&s;e, in which happine&s;s can be drawn only from recollection, and virtue will be all that we can recollect with plea&s;ure.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM no great admirer of grave writings, and therefore very frequently lay your papers a&s;ide before I have read them through; yet I cannot but confe&s;s that, by &s;low degrees, you have rai&s;ed my opinion of your under|&s;tanding, and, that, though I believe it will be long before I can be prevailed upon to re|gard you with much kindne&s;s, you have, how|ever, more of my e&s;teem than tho&s;e whom I &s;ometimes make happy with opportunities to fill my tea-pot, or pick up my fan. I &s;hall therefore chu&s;e you for the confident of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and a&s;k your coun&s;el with regard to the means of conquering or e&s;caping them, though I never expect from you any of that &s;oftne&s;s and pliancy, which con&s;titutes the perfection of a companion for the ladies: as in the place where I now am, I have recour&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="62">
to the ma&s;tiff for protection, though I have no intention of making him a lap-dog.</P>
<P>MY mamma is a very fine lady, who has more numerous, and more frequent a&s;&s;emblies at her hou&s;e, than any other per&s;on in the &s;ame quarter of the town. I was bred from my earlie&s;t infancy in a perpetual tumult of plea&s;ure, and remember to have heard of little el&s;e than me&s;&s;ages, vi&s;its, play-hou&s;es, and balls, of the aukwardne&s;s of one woman, and the coquetry of another, the charming con|venience of &s;ome ri&s;ing fa&s;hion, the difficulty of playing a new game, the incidents of a ma&s;querade, and the dre&s;&s;es of a court night. I knew before I was ten years old all the rules of paying and receiving vi&s;its, and to how much civility every one of my acquaintance was entitled; and was able to return, with the proper degree of re&s;erve, or of vivacity, the &s;tated and e&s;tabli&s;hed an&s;wer to every compliment; &s;o that I was very &s;oon celebra|ted as a wit, and a beauty, and had heard be|fore I was thirteen all that is ever &s;aid to a young lady. My mother was generous to &s;o uncommon a degree as to be plea&s;ed with my advance into life, and allowed me, without envy or reproof, to enjoy the &s;ame happine&s;s
<PB N="62" REF="63">
with her&s;elf; though mo&s;t women about her own age were very angry to &s;ee young girls &s;o forward, and many fine gentlemen told her how cruel it was to throw new chains upon mankind, and to tyrannize over them at the &s;ame time with her own charms, and tho&s;e of her daughter.</P>
<P>I HAVE now lived two and twenty years, and have pa&s;&s;ed of each year nine months in town, and three at Richmond; &s;o that my time has been &s;pent uniformly in the &s;ame company, and the &s;ame amu&s;ements, except as fa&s;hion has introduced new diver&s;ions, or the revolutions of the gay world have afford|ed new &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of wits and beaus. How|ever my mother is &s;o good an oeconomi&s;t of plea&s;ure, that I have no &s;pare hours upon my hands; for every morning brings &s;ome new appointment, and every night is hurried away by the nece&s;&s;ity of making our appearance at different places, and of being with one lady at the opera, and with another at the card table.</P>
<P>WHEN the time came of &s;ettling our &s;cheme of felicity for the &s;ummer, it was de|temined that I &s;hould pay a vi&s;it to a rich aunt
<PB N="63" REF="64">
in a remote county. As you know the chief conver&s;ation of all tea tables, in the &s;pring, a|ri&s;es from a communication of the manner in which time is to be pa&s;&s;ed till winter, it was a great relief to the barrenne&s;s of our topics, to relate the plea&s;ures that were in &s;tore for me, to de&s;cribe my uncle's &s;eat, with the park and gardens, the charming walks, and beautiful waterfalls; and every one told me how much &s;he envied me, and what &s;atisfacti|on &s;he had once enjoyed in a &s;ituation of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>AS we are all credulous in our own favour, and willing to imagine &s;ome latent &s;atisfaction in any thing which we have not experienced, I will confe&s;s to you, without re&s;traint, that I had &s;uffered my head to be filled with expectations of &s;ome namele&s;s plea&s;ure in a rural life, and that I hoped for the happy hour that &s;hould &s;et me free from noi&s;e, and flutter, and ceremony, di&s;mi&s;s me to the peaceful &s;hade, and lull me in content and tranquillity. To &s;olace my&s;elf under the mi&s;ery of delay, I &s;ometimes heard a &s;tudious lady of my ac|quaintance read pa&s;torals, I was delighted with &s;carce any talk but of leaving the town,
<PB N="64" REF="65">
and never went to bed without dreaming of groves, and meadows, and fri&s;king lambs.</P>
<P>AT length I had all my cloaths in a trunk, and &s;aw the coach at the door; I &s;prung in with ec&s;tacy, quarrelled with my maid for be|ing too long in taking leave of the other &s;er|vants, and rejoiced as the ground grew le&s;s which lay between me and the completion of my wi&s;hes. A few days brought me to a large old hou&s;e, encompa&s;&s;ed on three &s;ides with woody hills, and looking from the front on a gentle river, the &s;ight of which renew|ed all my expectations of plea&s;ure, and gave me &s;ome regret for having lived &s;o long with|out the enjoyment which the&s;e delightful &s;cenes were now to afford me. My aunt came out to receive me, but in a dre&s;s &s;o far removed from the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion, that I could &s;carcely look upon her without laughter, which would have been no kind requital for the trouble which &s;he had taken to make her|&s;elf fine again&s;t my arrival. The night and the next morning were driven along with en|quiries about our family; my aunt then ex|plained our pedigree, and told me &s;tories of my great grandfather's bravery in the civil
<PB N="65" REF="66">
wars, nor was it le&s;s than three days before I could per&s;uade her to leave me to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t oeconomy prevailed, &s;he went in the u&s;ual manner about her own affairs, and I was at liberty to range in the wilderne&s;s, and &s;it by the ca&s;cade. The novelty of the objects about me plea&s;ed me for a while, but after a few days they were new no longer, and I &s;oon began to perceive that the country was not my element; that &s;hades, and flowers, and lawns, and waters, had very &s;oon exhau&s;t|ed all their power of plea&s;ing, and that I had not in my&s;elf any fund of &s;atisfaction with which I could &s;upply the lo&s;s of my cu&s;tomary amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>I UNHAPPILY told my aunt, in the fir&s;t warmth of our embraces, that I had leave to &s;tay with her ten weeks. Six only are yet gone, and how &s;hall I live through the re|maining four? I go out and return; I pluck a flower, and throw it away; I catch an in|&s;ect, and when I have examined its colours, &s;et it at liberty; I fling a pebble into the wa|ter and &s;ee one circle &s;pread after another. When it chances to rain, I walk in the great hall, and watch the minute-hand upon the dial
<PB N="66" REF="67">
or play with a litter of kittens, which the cat happens to have brought in a lucky time.</P>
<P>MY aunt is afraid I &s;hall grow melancholy, and therefore encourages the neighbouring gentry to vi&s;it us. They came at fir&s;t with great eagerne&s;s to &s;ee the fine lady from Lon|don, but when we meet, we had no common to pick on which we could conver&s;e; they had no curio&s;ity after plays, operas, or mu&s;ick: and I find as little &s;atisfaction from their ac|counts of the quarrels, or alliances of families, who&s;e names, when once I can e&s;cape, I &s;hall never hear. The women have now &s;een me, know how my gown is made, and are &s;atisfi|ed; the men are generally afraid of me, and &s;ay little becau&s;e they think them&s;elves not at liberty to talk rudely.</P>
<P>THUS am I condemned to &s;olitude; the day moves &s;lowly forward, and I &s;ee the dawn with unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e I con&s;ider the night is at a great di&s;tance. I have tried to &s;leep by a brook, but find its murmurs ineffectual; &s;o that I am forced to be awake at lea&s;t twelve hours, without vi&s;its, without cards, without laughter, and without flattery. I walk be|cau&s;e I am di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;itting &s;till, and &s;it
<PB N="67" REF="68">
down becau&s;e I am weary with walking. I have no motive to action, nor any object of love, or hate, or fear, or inclination. I can|not dre&s;s with &s;pirit, for I have neither rival nor admirer. I cannot dance without a part|ner, nor be kind, or cruel, without a lover.</P>
<P>SUCH is the life of Euphelia, and &s;uch it is likely to continue for a month to come. I have not yet declared again&s;t exi&s;tence, nor called upon the de&s;tinies to cut my thread; but I have &s;incerely re&s;olved not to condemn my&s;elf to &s;uch another &s;ummer, nor too ha&s;|tily to flatter my&s;elf with happine&s;s. Yet I have heard, Mr Rambler, of tho&s;e who never thought them&s;elves &s;o much at ea&s;e as in &s;o|litude, and cannot but &s;u&s;pect it to be &s;ome way or other my own fault, that, without great pain, either of mind or body, I am thus weary of my&s;elf: that the current of youth &s;tagnates, and that I am langui&s;hing in a dead calm, for want of &s;ome external im|pul&s;e. I &s;hall therefore think you a benefac|tor to our &s;ex, if you will teach me the art of living alone; for I am confident that a thou|&s;and and a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and ladies, who affect to talk with ec&s;tacies of the plea&s;ures of the country, are in reality, like me, longing
<PB N="68" REF="69">
for the winter, and wi&s;hing to be delivered from them&s;elves by company and diver&s;ion.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who have written on the con&s;titution of the human body, and the original of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es by which it is afflicted, that every man comes into the world morbid, that there is no temperature &s;o exactly regulated but that &s;ome humour is fatally pre|dominant, and that we are generally impreg|nated, in our fir&s;t entrance upon life, with the &s;eeds of that malady, which, in time, &s;hall bring us to the grave.</P>
<P>THIS remark has been extended by others to the intellectual faculties. Some that ima|gine them&s;elves to have looked with more than common penetration into human nature, have
<PB N="69" REF="70">
endeavoured to per&s;uade us, that each man is born with a mind formed peculiarly for certain purpo&s;es, and with de&s;ires unalterably deter|mined to particular objects, from which the attention cannot be long diverted, and which alone, as they are well or ill per&s;ued, mu&s;t produce the prai&s;e or blame, the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, of his future life.</P>
<P>THIS po&s;ition has not, indeed, been hither|to proved with &s;trength proportionate to the a&s;&s;urance with which it has been advan|ced, and, perhaps, will never gain much prevalence by a clo&s;e examination.</P>
<P>IF the doctrine of innate ideas be it&s;elf di&s;|putable, there &s;eems to be little hope of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing an opinion, which &s;uppo&s;es that even complications of ideas have been given us at our birth, and that we are made by nature ambitious, or covetous, before we know the meaning of either power or money.</P>
<P>YET as every &s;tep in the progre&s;&s;ion of ex|i&s;tence changes our po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the things about us, &s;o as to lay us open to new a&s;&s;aults and particular dangers, and &s;ubjects us to inconveniences from which any other &s;itu|ation
<PB N="70" REF="71">
is exempt; as a publick or a private life, youth and age, wealth and poverty, have all &s;ome evil clo&s;ely adherent, which can|not wholly be e&s;caped but by quitting the &s;tate to which it is annexed, and &s;ubmitting to the incumbrances of &s;ome other condition: &s;o it cannot be denied that every difference in the &s;tructure of the mind has its advantages and its wants; and that failures and defects being in&s;eparable from humanity, however the pow|ers of under&s;tanding be extended or contract|ed, there will on one &s;ide or the other always be an avenue to error and mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>There &s;eem to be &s;ome &s;ouls &s;uited to great, and others to little employments; &s;ome for|med to &s;oar aloft, and take in wide views, and others to grovel on the ground, and con|fine their regard to a narrow &s;phere. Of the&s;e the one is always in danger of becoming u&s;e|le&s;s by a daring negligence, the other by a &s;crupulous &s;olicitude; the one collects many ideas, but confu&s;ed and indi&s;tinct; the other is bu&s;ied in minute accuracy, but without compa&s;s and without dignity.</P>
<P>THE general error of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s powerful and elevated under&s;tandings, is, that
<PB N="71" REF="72">
they form &s;chemes of too great extent, and flatter them&s;elves too ha&s;tily with &s;ucce&s;s; they feel their own force to be great, and, by the complacency with which every man &s;ur|veys him&s;elf, imagine it &s;till greater: they therefore look out for undertakings worthy of their abilities, and engage in them with very little precaution, for they imagine that every ob&s;truction will give way, and that, without any premeditated mea&s;ures, they &s;hall be able to find expedients in all difficulties. They are naturally apt to con&s;ider all prudential max|ims as below their regard, to treat with con|tempt tho&s;e &s;ecurities and re&s;ources which o|thers know them&s;elves obliged to provide, and di&s;dain to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es by e&s;ta|bli&s;hed means, and common gradations.</P>
<P>THIS precipitation, which is incited by the pride of intellectual &s;uperiority, is very often fatal to great de&s;igns. The &s;trength and re&s;o|lution of the combat are &s;eldom equal to the vehemence of the charge. He that meets with an oppo&s;it on which he did not expect, very quickly lo&s;es his courage, and too &s;oon con|&s;iders the enterpri&s;e as de&s;perate, only becau&s;e he had before concluded it ea&s;y. The vio|lence of his fir&s;t on&s;et is &s;ucceeded by a
<PB N="72" REF="73">
la&s;ting and unconquerable languor; the mi&s;|carriage &s;eizes his faculties; his conviction of the unrea&s;onable confidence, with which he had flattered his own de&s;ires, makes him fear|ful of giving way to new hopes; the contem|plation of an attempt, in which he has &s;o far fallen below the expectations which he had in|dulged, is always painful and vexatious; he therefore naturally turns his attention to more plea&s;ing objects, and habituates his imaginati|on to other entertainments, till, by &s;low de|grees, he quits his fir&s;t per&s;uit, and &s;uffers &s;ome other project to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his thoughts, in which the &s;ame ardour of mind promi&s;es him again certain &s;ucce&s;s, and which di&s;appointments of the &s;ame kind compel him to abandon.</P>
<P>THUS too much vigour in the beginning of an undertaking, often intercepts and prevents the &s;teadine&s;s and per&s;everance always nece&s;&s;a|ry in the conduct of any complicated &s;cheme, where many intere&s;ts are to be connected, ma|ny movements to be adju&s;ted, and the joint effort of di&s;tinct and independent powers to be directed to a &s;ingle point. In all important events which have been &s;uddenly brought to pa&s;s, chance has been the agent rather than
<PB N="73" REF="74">
rea&s;on; and, therefore, however tho&s;e, who &s;eemed to pre&s;ide in the tran&s;action, may have been celebrated by &s;uch as loved or feared them, &s;ucceeding times have commonly con&s;idered them as fortunate rather than prudent. Every de&s;ign in which the connexion is regularly traced from the fir&s;t motion to the la&s;t, mu&s;t be formed and executed by calm intrepidity, and requires not only courage which danger cannot turn a&s;ide, but con&s;tancy which fa|tigues cannot weary, and contrivance which impediments cannot exhau&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL the performances of human art, at which we look with prai&s;e or wonder, are in|&s;tances of the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force of per&s;everance: it is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid, and that di&s;tant countries are united with ca|nals. If a man was to compare the effect of a &s;ingle &s;troke of the pick-ax, or of one im|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pade, with the general de&s;ign and la&s;t con&s;equence, he would be overwhelm|ed by the &s;en&s;e of their di&s;proportion; yet tho&s;e petty operations, ince&s;&s;antly continued, in time &s;urmount the greate&s;t difficulties, and mountains are levelled, and oceans bounded, by the &s;lender force of human beings.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="75">
IT is therefore of the utmo&s;t importance that tho&s;e who have any intention of deviating from the beaten roads of life, and acquiring a reputation &s;uperior to the common names which are hourly &s;inking into oblivion, and &s;wept away by time among the refu&s;e of fame, &s;hould add to their rea&s;on, and their &s;pirit, the power of per&s;i&s;ting in their purpo&s;es; acquire the art of &s;apping what they cannot batter, and the habit of vanqui&s;hing ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance by ob&s;tinate attacks.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudent who would build his know|ledge on &s;olid foundations, and proceed by ju&s;t degrees to the pinacles of truth, is directed by the great philo&s;opher of France to begin by doubting of his own exi&s;tence. In like manner, whoever would complete any ardu|ous and intricate enterpri&s;e &s;hould, as &s;oon as his imagination can cool after the fir&s;t blaze of hope, place before his own eyes every po&s;&s;ible embarra&s;ment that may retard or defeat him. He &s;hould fir&s;t que&s;tion the probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and then endeavour to remove the ob|jections that he has rai&s;ed. It is proper, &s;ays old Markham, to exerci&s;e your hor&s;e on the more inconvenient &s;ide of the cour&s;e, that if
<PB N="75" REF="76">
he &s;hould, in the race, be forced upon it, he may not be di&s;couraged; and Horace advi&s;es his poetical friend to con&s;ider every day as the la&s;t which he &s;hall enjoy, becau&s;e that will al|ways give plea&s;ure which we receive beyond our hopes. If we alarm our&s;elves beforehand with more difficulties than we really find, we &s;hall be animated by unexpected facility with double &s;pirit; and if we find our cautions and fears ju&s;tified by the con&s;equence, there will however happen nothing again&s;t which provi|&s;ion has not been made, no &s;udden &s;hock will be received, nor will the main &s;cheme be di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, &s;ome danger le&s;t he that too &s;crupulou&s;ly balances probabilities, and too per&s;picaciou&s;ly fore&s;ees ob&s;tacles, &s;hould remain always in a &s;tate of inaction, without venturing upon attempts on which he will think it not unlikely that he may &s;pend his la|bour without advantage. But previous de|&s;pondence is not the fault of tho&s;e for whom this e&s;&s;ay is de&s;igned; they who require to be warned again&s;t precipitation, will not &s;uffer more fear to intrude into their contemplations than is nece&s;&s;ary to allay the efferve&s;cence of an agitated fancy. As <HI>Des Cartes</HI> has kindly
<PB N="76" REF="77">
&s;hewn how a manmay prove to him&s;elf his own exi&s;tence, if once he can be prevailed upon to que&s;tion it, &s;o the ardent and adventurous will not be long without finding &s;ome plau&s;ible extenuation of the greate&s;t difficulties; and, indeed, &s;uch is the uncertainty of all human affairs, that &s;ecurity and de&s;pair are equal fol|lies, and as it is pre&s;umption and arrogance to anticipate triumphs, it is weakne&s;s and cow|ardice to progno&s;ticate mi&s;carriages. The numbers that have been &s;topped in their ca|reer of happine&s;s are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the uncertainty of human fore&s;ight; but there are not wanting contrary in&s;tances of &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s obtained again&s;t all appearances, as may warrant the bolde&s;t flights of genius, if they are &s;upported by un&s;haken per&s;eve|rance.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had lately a very remarkable dream, which made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I remember it every word; and if you are not better employed, you may read the relation of it as follows.</P>
<P>METHOUGHT I was in the mid&s;t of a very entertaining &s;et of company, and extremely delighted in attending to a lively conver&s;ation, when on a &s;udden I perceived one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking figures imagination can frame, ad|vancing towards me. She was dre&s;t in black, her &s;kin was contracted into a thou&s;and wrin|kles, her eyes deep &s;unk in her head, and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death. Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting &s;everity, and her hands armed with whips and &s;corpions. As &s;oon as &s;he came near, with a horrid frown, and a voice that chilled my very blood, &s;he bid me follow
<PB N="78" REF="79">
her. I obeyed, and &s;he led me through rug|ged paths, be&s;et with briars and thorns, into a deep &s;olitary valley. Wherever &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the fading verdure withered beneath her &s;teps; her pe&s;tilential breath infected the air with malignant vapours, ob&s;cured the lu&s;tre of the &s;un, and involved the fair face of heaven in univer&s;al gloom. Di&s;mal howlings re&s;ounded through the fore&s;t, from every baleful tree the night-raven uttered his dreadful note, and the pro&s;pect was filled with de&s;olation and horror. In the mid&s;t of this tremendous &s;cene my ex|ecrable guide addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner.</P>
<P>"RETIRE with me, O ra&s;h unthinking mortal, from the vain allurements of a de|ceitful world, and learn that plea&s;ure was not de&s;igned the portion of human life. Man was born to mourn and to be wretch|ed; this is the condition of all below the &s;tars, and whoever endeavours to oppo&s;e it acts in contradiction to the will of heaven. Fly then from the fatal enchantments of youth and &s;ocial delight, and here con&s;e|crate thy &s;olitary hours to lamentation and woe. Mi&s;ery is the duty of all &s;ublunary beings, and every enjoyment is an offence
<PB N="79" REF="80">
to the deity, who is to be wor&s;hipped only by the mortification of every &s;en&s;e of plea|&s;ure, and the everla&s;ting exerci&s;e of &s;ighs and tears."</P>
<P>THIS melancholy picture of life quite &s;unk my &s;pirits, and &s;eemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me. I threw my&s;elf beneath a bla&s;ted yeugh, where the winds blew cold and di&s;mal round my head, and dreadful apprehen&s;ions chilled my heart. Here I re&s;ol|ved to lie till the hand of death, which I im|patiently invoked, &s;hould put an end to the mi&s;eries of a life &s;o deplorably wretched. In this &s;ad &s;ituation I &s;pied on one hand of me a deep muddy river, who&s;e heavy waves rolled on in flow &s;ullen murmurs. Here I determin|ed to plunge, and was ju&s;t upon the brink, when I found my&s;elf &s;uddenly drawn back. I turned about, and was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of the lovelie&s;t object I had ever beheld. The mo&s;t engaging charms of youth and beauty appeared in all her form; effulgent glories &s;parkled in her eyes, and their awful &s;plen|dours were &s;oftened by the gentle&s;t looks of compa&s;&s;ion and peace. At her approach, the frightful &s;pectre, who had before tormented me, vani&s;hed away, and with her all the hor|rors
<PB N="80" REF="81">
&s;he had cau&s;ed. The gloomy clouds brightened into chearful &s;un-&s;hine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of Eden. I was quite tran&s;ported at this unex|pected change, and reviving plea&s;ure began to glad my thoughts, when, with a look of inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s, my beauteous deliverer thus uttered her divine in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>"My name is RELIGION. I am the off|&s;pring of TRUTH and LOVE, and the pa|rent of BENEVOLENCE, HOPE and JOY. That mon&s;ter from who&s;e power I have freed you is called SUPERSTITION, &s;he is the child of DISCONTENT, and her follow|ers are FEAR and SORROW. Thus different as we are, &s;he has often the in&s;olence to a&s;|&s;ume my name and character, and &s;educes unhappy mortals to think us the &s;ame, till &s;he, at length, drives them to the borders of DESPAIR, that dreadful aby&s;s into which you were ju&s;t going to &s;ink."</P>
<P>"LOOK round and &s;urvey the various beauties of this globe, which heaven has de&s;tined for the &s;eat of human race, and con&s;ider whether a world thus exqui&s;itely
<PB N="81" REF="82">
framed could be meant for the abode of mi&s;ery and pain. For what end has the lavi&s;h hand of providence diffu&s;ed &s;uch in|numerable objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the privilege of exi&s;tence, and be filled with gratitude to the beneficent author of it? Thus to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings he has &s;ent, is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merely as means of plea|&s;ure, is pitiable ignorance, or ab&s;urd per|ver&s;ene&s;s. Infinite goodne&s;s is the &s;ource of created exi&s;tence; the proper tendency of every rational being, from the highe&s;t order of raptured &s;eraphs, to the meane&s;t rank of men, is to ri&s;e ince&s;&s;antly from lower degrees of happine&s;s to higher. They have each faculties a&s;&s;igned them for vari|ous orders of delights."</P>
<P>"WHAT, cried I, is this the language of RELIGION? Does &s;he lead her votaries through flowery paths, and bid them pa&s;s an unlaborious life? Where are the painful toils of virtue, the mortifications of peni|tents, the &s;elf-denying exerci&s;es of &s;aints and heroes?"</P>
<P>"THE true enjoyments of a rea&s;onable

being," an&s;wered &s;he mildly, "do not con&s;i&s;t in unbounded indulgence, or luxu|rious ea&s;e, in the tumult of pa&s;&s;ions, the languor of indolence, or the flutter of light amu&s;ements. Yielding to immoral plea|&s;ure corrupts the mind, living to animal and trifling ones deba&s;es it; both in their degree di&s;qualify it for its genuine good, and con&s;ign it over to wretchedne&s;s. Whoever would be really happy mu&s;t make the diligent and regular exerci&s;e of his &s;u|perior powers his chief attention, adoring the perfections of his maker, expre&s;&s;ing good-will to his fellow creatures, cultiva|ting inward rectitude. To his lower fa|culties he mu&s;t allow &s;uch gratifications as will, by refre&s;hing him, invigorate his no|bler per&s;uits. In the regions inhabited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity for e|ver blooms, joy flows there with a perpetu|al and abundant &s;tream, nor needs there any mound to check its cour&s;e. Beings con&s;cious of a frame of mind originally di&s;|ea&s;ed, as all the human race has cau&s;e to be, mu&s;t u&s;e the regimen of a &s;tricter &s;elf-government. Whoever has been guilty of voluntary exce&s;&s;es mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit both to the painful workings of nature,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
and needful &s;everities of medicine in order to his cure. Still he is intitled to a mode|rate &s;hare of whatever alleviating accom|modations this fair man&s;ion of his merci|ful parent affords, con&s;i&s;tent with his reco|very. And in proportion as this recovery advances, the livelie&s;t joy will &s;pring from his &s;ecret &s;en&s;e of an amended and improving heart.&mdash;So far from the horrors of de&s;pair is the condition even of the guilty.&mdash;Shudder, poor mortal, at the thought of that gulph in|to which thou wa&s;t but now going to plunge."</P>
<P>"WHILE the mo&s;t faulty have every en|couragement to amend, the more innocent &s;oul will be &s;upported with &s;till &s;weeter con&s;olations under all its experience of hu|man infirmities; &s;upported by the gladden|ing a&s;&s;urances that every &s;incere endeavour to out-grow them, &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, accept|ed and rewarded. To &s;uch a one the low|lie&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement is but a deep-laid foun|dation for the mo&s;t elevated hopes; &s;ince they who faithfully examine and acknow|ledge what they are, &s;hall be enabled under my conduct to become what they de&s;ire. The chri&s;tian and the heroe are in&s;eparable; and to the a&s;pirings of una&s;&s;uming tru&s;t,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
and filial confidence, are &s;et no bounds. To him who is animated with a view of obtain|ing approbation from the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, no difficulty is in&s;urmountable. Secure in this per&s;uit of every needful aid, his conflict with the &s;evere&s;t pains and tri|als, is little more than the vigorous exerci|&s;es of a mind in health. His patient de|pendence on that providence which looks through all eternity, his &s;ilent re&s;ignation, his ready accommodation of his thoughts and behaviour to its in&s;crutable ways, is at once the mo&s;t excellent &s;ort of &s;elf-denial, and a &s;ource of the mo&s;t exalted tran&s;ports. Society is the true &s;phere of human virtue. In &s;ocial, active, life, difficulties will per|petually be met with; re&s;traints of many kinds will be nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;tudying to behave right in re&s;pect of the&s;e is a di&s;cipline of the human heart, u&s;eful to others, and improving to it&s;elf. Suffering is no duty but where it is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid guilt, or to do good; nor plea&s;ure a crime, but where it &s;trengthens the influence of bad inclinati|ons, or le&s;&s;ens the generous activity of vir|tue. The happine&s;s allotted to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, is indeed faint and low, compared with his immortal pro&s;pects, and
<PB N="85" REF="86">
noble capacities; but yet whatever portion of it the di&s;tributing hand of heaven offers to each individual, is a needful &s;upport and refre&s;hment for the pre&s;ent moment, &s;o far as it may not hinder the attaining his final de&s;tination."</P>
<P>"RETURN then with me from continual mi&s;ery to moderate enjoyment, and grate|ful alacrity. Return from the contracted views of &s;olitude to the proper duties of a relative and dependent being. Religion is not confined to cells and clo&s;ets, nor re|&s;trained to &s;ullen retirement. The&s;e are the gloomy doctrines of SUPERSTITION, by which &s;he endeavours to break tho&s;e chains of benevolence and &s;ocial affection, that link the welfare of every particular with that of the whole. Remember that the greate&s;t honour you can pay to the au|thor of your being is by &s;uch a chearful be|haviour, as di&s;covers a mind &s;atisfied with his di&s;pen&s;ations."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH, in the di&s;&s;ertations which you have given us on marriage, very ju&s;t cautions are laid down again&s;t the com|mon cau&s;es of infelicity, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having, in that important choice, the fir&s;t re|gard to virtue is carefully inculcated; yet I cannot think the &s;ubject &s;o much exhau&s;ted, but that a little reflection would pre&s;ent to the mind many que&s;tions in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which great numbers are intere&s;ted, and many pre|cepts which de&s;erve to be more particularly and forcibly impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
YOU &s;eem, like mo&s;t of the writers that have gone before you, to have allowed, as an uncon|te&s;ted principle, that <HI>Marriage is generally un|happy</HI>: but I know not whether a man who profe&s;&s;es to think for him&s;elf, and draws his opinions from his own ob&s;ervations, does not depart from his character when he follows the croud thus implicitly, and receives maxims without recalling them to a new examination, e&s;pecially when they compri&s;e &s;o wide a cir|cuit of life, and include &s;uch variety of cir|cum&s;tances. As I have an equal right with others to give my opinion of the objects about me, and a better title to determine concerning that &s;tate which I have tried, than many who talk of it without experience, I am unwilling to be re&s;trained by mere authority from ad|vancing, what, I believe, an accurate view of the world will confirm, that marriage is not commonly unhappy, otherwi&s;e than as life is unhappy; and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who complain of connubial mi&s;eries, have as much &s;atisfaction as their nature would have admitted, or their conduct procured in any other condition.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, common to hear both &s;exes
<PB N="88" REF="89">
repine at their condition, relate the happine&s;s of their earlier years, blame the folly and ra&s;hne&s;s of their own choice, and warn tho&s;e whom they &s;ee coming into the world again&s;t the &s;ame precipitance and infatuation. But it is to be remembred, that the days which they &s;o much wi&s;h to call back, are the days not only of celibacy but of youth, the days of novelty and improvement, of ardour and of hope, of health and vigour of body, of gaye|ty and lightne&s;s of heart. It is not ea&s;y to unite life with any circum&s;tances in which youth will not be delightful; and I am afraid that whe|ther married or unmarried, we &s;hall find the ve&s;ture of terre&s;trial exi&s;tence more heavy and cumbrous, the longer it is worn.</P>
<P>THAT both cen&s;ure them&s;elves for the indi&s;cretion of their choice, is not a &s;ufficient proof that they have cho&s;en ill, &s;ince we &s;ee the &s;ame di&s;content at every other part of life which we cannot change. Conver&s;e with almo&s;t any man, grown old in a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and you will find him regretting that he did not enter into &s;ome different cour&s;e, to which he too late finds his genius better adapted, or in which he di&s;covers that wealth and honour are more ea&s;ily attained.
<PB N="89" REF="90">
The merchant, &s;ays Horace, envies the &s;oldier, and the &s;oldier recounts the felicity of the merchant; the lawyer when his clients harra&s;s him, calls out for the quiet of the country|man; and the countryman, when bu&s;ine&s;s calls him to town, proclaims that there is no happine&s;s but amid&s;t opulence and crouds. Every man recounts the inconveniencies of his own &s;tation, and always thinks tho&s;e of any other le&s;s, becau&s;e he has not felt them. Thus the married prai&s;e the ea&s;e and freedom of a &s;ingle &s;tate, and the &s;ingle fly to marriage from the wearine&s;s of &s;olitude. From all our ob&s;ervations we may collect with certainty, that mi&s;ery is the lot of man, but cannot di&s;|cover in what particular condition it will find mo&s;t alleviations; or whether all external ap|pendages are not, as we u&s;e them well or ill, the cau&s;es either of pain or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHOEVER feels great pain naturally hopes for ea&s;e from change of po&s;ture; he changes it, and finds him&s;elf equally tormented: and of the &s;ame kind are the expedients by which we endeavour to obviate or elude tho&s;e unea|&s;ine&s;&s;es, to which mortality will always be &s;ubject. It is not likely that the married &s;tate is eminently mi&s;erable, &s;ince we &s;ee &s;uch
<PB N="90" REF="91">
numbers, whom the death of their partners has &s;et free from it, entering it again.</P>
<P>WIVES and hu&s;bands are, indeed, ince&s;|&s;antly complaining of each other; and there would be rea&s;on for imagining that almo&s;t every hou&s;e was infe&s;ted with perver&s;ene&s;s or oppre&s;&s;ion beyond human &s;ufferance, did we not know upon how &s;mall occa&s;ions &s;ome minds bur&s;t out into lamentations and re|proaches, and how naturally every animal re|venges his pain upon tho&s;e who happen to be near, without any nice examination of its cau&s;e. We are always willing to fancy our|&s;elves within a little of happine&s;s, and when, with repeated efforts, we cannot reach it, per&s;uade our&s;elves that it is intercepted by an ill-paired mate, &s;ince, if we could find any other ob&s;tacle, it would be our own fault that it was not removed.</P>
<P>ANATOMISTS have often remarked, that though our di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ufficiently numerous and &s;evere, yet when we enquire into the &s;truc|ture of the body, the tenderne&s;s of &s;ome parts, the minutene&s;s of others, and the im|men&s;e multiplicity of animal functions that mu&s;t concur to the healthful and vigorous ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="91" REF="92">
of all our powers, there appears rea&s;on to wonder rather that we are pre&s;erved &s;o long, than that we peri&s;h &s;o &s;oon, and that our frame &s;ub&s;i&s;ts for a &s;ingle day, or hour, without di&s;|order, rather than that it &s;hould be broken or ob&s;tructed by violence of accidents, or length of time.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame reflection ari&s;es in my mind, upon ob&s;ervation of the manner in which marriage is frequently contracted. When I &s;ee the avaricious and crafty taking compani|ons to their tables, and their beds, without any enquiry, but after farms and money; or the giddy and thoughtle&s;s uniting them&s;elves for life to tho&s;e whom they have only &s;een by the light of tapers at a ball; when parents make articles for their children, without en|quiring after their con&s;ent; when &s;ome mar|ry for heirs to di&s;appoint their brothers, and others throw them&s;elves into the arms of tho&s;e whom they do not love, becau&s;e they have found them&s;elves rejected where they were more &s;olicitous to plea&s;e; when &s;ome marry becau&s;e their &s;ervants cheat them, &s;ome be|cau&s;e they &s;quander their own money, &s;ome becau&s;e their hou&s;es are pe&s;tered with compa|ny, &s;ome becau&s;e they will live like other peo|ple,
<PB N="92" REF="93">
and &s;ome only becau&s;e they are &s;ick of them|&s;elves, I am not &s;o much inclined to wonder that marriage is &s;ometimes unhappy, as that it appears generally &s;o little loaded with cala|mity; and cannot but conclude that &s;ociety has &s;omething in it&s;elf eminently agreable to human nature, when I find its plea&s;ures &s;o great that even the ill choice of a companion can hardly over-balance them.</P>
<P>BY the antient cu&s;tom of the Mu&s;covites the men and women never &s;aw each other till they were joined beyond the power of parting. It may be &s;u&s;pected that by this method many un&s;uitable matches were produced, and many tempers a&s;&s;ociated that were very little qualifi|ed to give plea&s;ure to each other. Yet, per|haps, among a people &s;o little delicate, where the paucity of gratifications, and the unifor|mity of life gave no opportunity for imagina|tion to interpo&s;e its objections, there was not much danger of capricious di&s;like, and while they felt neither cold nor hunger they might live quietly together, without any thought of the defects of one another.</P>
<P>AMONGST us, whom knowledge has made Mice, and affluence wanton, there are, indeed,
<PB N="93" REF="94">
more cautions requi&s;ite to &s;ecure tranquillity; and yet if we ob&s;erve the manner in which tho&s;e conver&s;e, who have &s;ingled out each o|ther for marriage, we &s;hall, perhaps, not think that the Ru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t much by their re&s;traint. For the whole endeavour of both parties, dur|ing the time of court&s;hip, is to hinder them|&s;elves from being known, and to di&s;gui&s;e their natural temper, and real de&s;ires, in hypo|critical imitation, &s;tudied compliance, and continued affection. From the time that their love is avowed, neither &s;ees the other but in a ma&s;k, and the cheat is managed often on both &s;ides with &s;o much art, and di&s;co|vered afterwards with &s;o much abruptne&s;s, that each has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome tran&s;|formation has happened on the wedding-night, and that by a &s;trange impo&s;ture one has been courted, and another married.</P>
<P>I DESIRE you, therefore, Mr RAMBLER, to que&s;tion all who &s;hall hereafter come to you with matrimonial complaints, concerning their behaviour in the time of court&s;hip, and inform them that they are neither to wonder nor repine, when a contract begun with fraud has ended in di&s;appointment.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I find that you have paid &s;o much regard to my complaints, as to publi&s;h them, I am inclined by vanity, or gratitude, to continue our corre&s;pondence; and, indeed, without either of the&s;e motives, I am, at pre|&s;ent, glad of an opportunity to write, for I am not much accu&s;tomed to keep in any thing that &s;wells my heart, and have here none with whom I can very freely conver&s;e; and while I am thus employed, &s;ome of tho&s;e tedious hours, which I have condemned my|&s;elf to pa&s;s in this place, will &s;lip away. When I return to my u&s;ual amu&s;ement of watching the clock, I &s;hall find that I have di&s;burdened my&s;elf of part of the day, and that the time of my return from exile is le&s;s remote.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
YOU perceive that I do not pretend to claim any great merit from my regard to your performances, or to write with much con&s;i|deration of any thing but my own conveni|ence; and, not to conceal from you my real &s;entiments, the little time which I have here &s;pent, again&s;t my will, in &s;olitary meditation, has not much contributed to my veneration for authors. I have now &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that, with all your &s;plendid profe&s;&s;ions of wi&s;dom, and &s;eeming regard for truth and virtue, you have very little &s;incerity; that you either write what you do not think, and willingly impo&s;e upon mankind, or that you take no care to think right, but while you &s;et up your&s;elf as a guide in the labyrinth of life, mi&s;lead your followers by credulity, or neg|ligence; that you take the liberty of produ|cing to the publick whatever notions you can &s;peciou&s;ly maintain, or elegantly expre&s;s, without enquiring whether they are ju&s;t; and that you are apt to think your&s;elf qualified by books to treat on &s;ubjects which are on|ly to be under&s;tood by ob&s;ervation and expe|rience, and tran&s;cribe hereditary fal&s;hoods from old authors, perhaps as ignorant and carele&s;s as your&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">
YOU may, perhaps, wonder that I expre&s;s my&s;elf with &s;o much acrimony on a que&s;tion in which women are &s;uppo&s;ed to have very lit|tle intere&s;t; and you are likely enough, for I have &s;een many in&s;tances of the &s;aucine&s;s of &s;cholars, to tell me that I am more properly employed in playing with my kittens, than in giving my&s;elf airs of critici&s;m, and cen&s;ur|ing the learned. But you are mi&s;taken if you imagine that I am to be intimidated by your contempt, or &s;ilenced by your reproofs. As I read, I have a right to judge, as I am injured, I have a right to complain; and the&s;e privile|ges, which I have purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a rate. I &s;hall not ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>TO read has, indeed, never been my bu|&s;ine&s;s; but as there are hours of lei&s;ure in the mo&s;t active life, I have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperfluities of time, which the diver&s;ions of the town left upon my hands, in turning over a large collection of tragedies and romances, which chance threw early in my way, where, a|mong&s;t other &s;entiments, common to all au|thors of this cla&s;s, I have found almo&s;t every page filled with the charms and happine&s;s of a country life; that life to which every &s;tate&s;man
<PB N="97" REF="98">
in the highe&s;televation of his pro&s;perity is con|triving to retire; that life to which every tragick heroine in &s;ome &s;cene or other wi&s;hes to have been born, and which is always re|pre&s;ented as a certain refuge from folly and anxiety, from pa&s;&s;ion, and from guilt.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible to read &s;o many pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations, and &s;oothing de&s;criptions, without feeling &s;ome de&s;ire to enjoy the &s;tate in which all this felicity was to be enjoyed; and there|fore I received with raptures the invitation of my good aunt, and expected that by &s;ome unknown influence I &s;hould find all hopes and fears, all jealou&s;ies and competitions va|ni&s;h from my heart upon my fir&s;t arrival at the &s;eats of innocence and tranquillity; that I &s;hould &s;leep in halcyon bowers, and wander in ely&s;ian gardens, where I &s;hould meet with nothing but the &s;oftne&s;s of benevolence, the candour of &s;implicity, and the chearfulne&s;s of content; where I &s;hould &s;ee rea&s;on exerting her &s;overeignty over life, without any inter|ruption from envy, avarice, or ambition, and every day pa&s;&s;ing in &s;uch a manner as the &s;e|vere&s;t wi&s;dom &s;hould approve.</P>
<P>THIS, Mr RAMBLER, I tell you I expect|ed,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and this I had by an hundred authors been taught to expect. By this expectation I was led hither, and here I live in a &s;tate of perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s, without any other com|fort than that of hoping to return to London. Having, &s;ince I wrote my former letter, been driven, by the mere nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;caping from ab&s;olute inactivity, to make my&s;elf more ac|quainted with the affairs and inhabitants of this place, I am now no longer an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to rural conver&s;ation and employ|ments, but am very far from di&s;covering in them more innocence or wi&s;dom, than in the &s;entiments or conduct of tho&s;e with whom I have pa&s;&s;ed more chearful and more fa&s;hiona|ble hours.</P>
<P>IT is common to reproach the tea-table, and the park, with giving opportunities and en|couragement to &s;candal. I cannot, indeed, wholly clear them from the charge; but mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve in favour of the modi&s;h prattlers, that, if not by principle, we are at lea&s;t by accident le&s;s guilty of defamation than the country ladies. For having greater num|bers to ob&s;erve and cen&s;ure, we are common|ly content to charge them only with their own faults or follies, and &s;eldom give way to ma|levolence,
<PB N="99" REF="100">
but &s;uch as ari&s;es from &s;ome injury or affront, real or imaginary, offered to our|&s;elves. But in the&s;e di&s;tant provinces, where the &s;ame families inhabit the &s;ame hou&s;es from age to age, they tran&s;mit and recount the faults of a whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I have been in|formed how every e&s;tate in the neighbourhood was originally got, and find, if I may credit the accounts given me, that there is not a &s;in|gle acre in the hands of the right owner. I have been told of intrigues between beaus and toa&s;ts that have been now three centuries in their quiet graves, and am often entertained with traditionary &s;candal on per&s;ons of who&s;e names there would have been no remem|brance, had they not committed &s;omewhat that might di&s;grace their de&s;cendents.</P>
<P>IN one of my vi&s;its I happened to commend the air and dignity of a young lady, who had ju&s;t left the company; upon which two grave matrons looked with great &s;line&s;s at each other, and then the older of them a&s;ked whether I had ever &s;een the picture of Henry the eighth. You may imagine that I did not immediately perceive the propriety of the que&s;tion, but af|ter having waited a while for information, I was told that the lady's grandmother had a

<P>IF once there happens a quarrel between the principal per&s;ons of two families, the ma|lignity is continued without end, and it is common for two old maids to fall out about &s;ome election, in which their grandfathers were competitors; the heart-burnings of the civil war are not yet extingui&s;hed; there are two families in the neighbourhood who have de&s;troyed each others game from the time of Philip and Mary; and when an account came of an inundation, which had injured the plan|tations of a worthy gentleman, one of the hearers remarked, with exultation, that he might now have &s;ome notion of the ravages committed by his ance&s;tors in their retreat from Bo&s;worth.</P>

<P>OF the pa&s;&s;ions with which the mind of man is agitated, it may be ob&s;erved, that they naturally ha&s;ten towards their own extinction by inciting and quickening the at|tainment of their objects. Thus fear urges our flight, and de&s;ire animates our progre&s;s; and if there are &s;ome which perhaps may be indulged till they out-grow the good appro|priated to their &s;atisfaction, as is frequently ob&s;erved of avarice and ambition, yet their immediate tendency is to &s;ome means of hap|pine&s;s really exi&s;ting, and generally within the pro&s;pect. The mi&s;er always imagines that
<PB N="103" REF="104">
there is a cer ain &s;um that will fill his heart to the brim; and the ambitious man, like king Pyrrhus, has an acqui&s;ition in his thoughts that is to terminate his labours, after which he &s;hall pa&s;s the re&s;t of his life in ea&s;e or gay|ety, in repo&s;e or devotion.</P>
<P>SORROW is perhaps the only affection of the brea&s;t that can be excepted from this gene|ral remark, and it therefore de&s;erves the parti|cular attention of tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;umed the arduous province of pre&s;erving the balance of our mental con&s;titution, and of admini&s;tering phy&s;ick to the &s;oul. The other pa&s;&s;ions are di&s;ea&s;es indeed, but they nece&s;&s;arily direct us to their proper cure. A man at once feels the pain, and knows the medicine, to which he is carried with greater ha&s;te, as the evil which requires it is more excruciating, and cures him&s;elf by unerring in&s;tinct, as the wounded &s;tags of Crete are related by Aelian to have re|cour&s;e to vulnerary herbs. But for &s;orrow there is no remedy provided by nature, it is often occa&s;ioned by accidents irreparable, and dwells upon objects that have lo&s;t or changed their exi&s;tence; it requires what it cannot hope, that the laws of nature &s;hould be re|pealed,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
that the dead &s;hould return, or the pa&s;t &s;hould be recalled.</P>
<P>SORROW is not that regret for negligence or error which may animate us to future care or activity, or that repentance of crimes for which, however irrevocable, our creator has promi&s;ed to accept it as an attonement; the pain which ari&s;es from the&s;e cau&s;es has very &s;alutary effects, and is every hour extenuating it&s;elf by the reparation of tho&s;e mi&s;carriages that produce it. Sorrow is properly that &s;tate of the mind in which our de&s;ires are fixed upon the pa&s;t, without looking forward to the fu|ture, an ince&s;&s;ant wi&s;h that &s;omething were otherwi&s;e than it has been, a tormenting and hara&s;&s;ing want of &s;ome enjoyment or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on which we have lo&s;t, and which no endea|vours can po&s;&s;ibly regain. Into &s;uch angui&s;h many have &s;unk upon &s;ome &s;udden diminuti|on of their fortune, an unexpected bla&s;t of their reputation, or the lo&s;s of children or friends. They have &s;uffered all &s;en&s;ibility of plea&s;ure to be de&s;troyed by a &s;ingle blow, have given up for ever the hopes of &s;ub&s;tituting any other object in the room of that which they lament, have re&s;igned the remaining part of their lives to gloom and &s;olitude, com|plaints
<PB N="105" REF="106">
and de&s;pondency, worn them&s;elves out in unavailing mi&s;ery, and &s;unk down at la&s;t under their burthen.</P>
<P>YET &s;o much is this pa&s;&s;ion the natural con&s;equence of tenderne&s;s and endearment, that, however painful and however u&s;ele&s;s, it is ju&s;tly reproachful not to feel it on &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions; and &s;o widely and con&s;tantly has it always prevailed, that the laws of &s;ome na|tions, and the cu&s;toms of others, have limited a time for the external appearances of grief cau&s;ed by the di&s;&s;olution of clo&s;e alliances, and the breach of dome&s;tic union.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems determined, by the general &s;uffrage of mankind, that &s;orrow is to a certain point laudable, as the offspring of love, or at lea&s;t pardonable as the effect of weakne&s;s; but that it ought not to be &s;uffered to increa&s;e by in|dulgence, but mu&s;t give way, after a &s;tated time, to &s;ocial duties, and the common avo|cations of life. It is at fir&s;t unavoidable, and therefore mu&s;t be allowed, whether with or without our choice; it may afterwards be ad|mitted as a decent and affectionate te&s;timony of kindne&s;s and e&s;teem; &s;omething will be extorted by nature, and &s;omething may be giv|en
<PB N="106" REF="107">
to the world. But all beyond the bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, or the forms of &s;olemnity, is not only u&s;ele&s;s, but culpable; for we have no righ to &s;acrifice, to the vain longings of affection, that time which providence allows us for the ta&s;k of our &s;tation.</P>
<P>YET it too often happens that &s;orrow, thus lawfully entering, gains &s;uch a firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, that it is not afterwards to be ejected; the mournful ideas, fir&s;t violently im|pre&s;&s;ed, and afterwards willingly received, &s;o much engro&s;s the attention, as to predominate in every meditation, to intrude uncalled, to darken gayety, and perplex ratiocination. An habitual &s;adne&s;s then &s;eizes upon the &s;oul, and the faculties are chained to a &s;ingle object, which can never be contemplated but with hopele&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This is a &s;tate of dejection from which it is often very difficult to ri&s;e to chearfulne&s;s and alacrity, and therefore many who have laid down &s;peculative rules of mental health, think pre&s;ervatives ea&s;ier than remedies, and teach us not to tru&s;t our&s;elves with favourite enjoyments, not to indulge the luxury of fond|ne&s;s,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
but to keep our minds always &s;u&s;pended in &s;uch a &s;tate of indifference, that we may change any of the objects about us without in|convenience or emotion.</P>
<P>AN exact compliance with this rule might, perhaps, contribute to tranquillity, but &s;urely it would never produce happine&s;s. He that regards none &s;o much as to be afraid of lo&s;ing them, mu&s;t live for ever without the gentle plea&s;ures of &s;ympathy and confidence; he mu&s;t feel no melting fondne&s;s, no warmth of benevolence, nor any of tho&s;e hone&s;t joys which nature annexes to the power of plea|&s;ing. And as no man can ju&s;tly claim more tenderne&s;s than he pays, he mu&s;t forfeit his &s;hare in all that officious and watchful kindne&s;s which love only can dictate, and all tho&s;e le|nient endearments by which love only can &s;oft|en life. He may ju&s;tly be overlooked and ne|glected by &s;uch as have more warmth in their heart; for who would be the friend of him, whom, with whatever a&s;&s;iduity he may be courted, and with whatever &s;ervices obliged, his principles will not &s;uffer to make equal re|turns, and who, when you have exhau&s;ted all the in&s;tances of good will, can only be prevail|ed on not to be an enemy?</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">
AN attempt to pre&s;erve life in a &s;tate of neutrality and indifference, is unrea&s;onable and vain. If by excluding joy we could &s;hut out grief, the &s;cheme would de&s;erve very &s;e|rious attention; but &s;ince, however we may debar our&s;elves from happine&s;s, mi&s;ery will find its way at many inlets, and the a&s;&s;aults of pain will force our regards, though we may withhold it from the invitations of plea|&s;ure, we may &s;urely endeavour to rai&s;e life a|bove the middle point of apathy at one time, &s;ince it will nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink below it at another.</P>
<P>BUT though it cannot be rea&s;onable not to gain happine&s;s for fear of lo&s;ing it, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in proportion to the plea&s;ure of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, will be for &s;ome time our &s;orrow for the lo&s;s; but it is the province of the morali&s;t to enquire whether &s;uch pains may not quickly give way to mitigation. Some have thought, that the mo&s;t certain way to clear the heart from its embarra&s;&s;ment is to drag it by force into &s;cenes of merriment. Others imagine, that &s;uch a tran&s;ition is too violent, and recommend rather to &s;ooth it in|to tranquillity, by making it acquainted with mi&s;eries more dreadful and afflictive, and di|verting to the calamities of others the regard
<PB N="109" REF="110">
which we are inclined to fix too clo&s;ely upon our own misfortunes.</P>
<P>IT may be doubted whether either of tho&s;e remedies will be &s;ufficiently powerful. The efficacy of mirth it is not always ea&s;y to try, and the indulgence of melancholy may be &s;u&s;pected to be one of tho&s;e medicines, which will de&s;troy, if it happens not to cure.</P>
<P>THE &s;afe and general antidote again&s;t &s;or|row, is employment. It is commonly ob&s;er|ved, that among &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, though there is much kindne&s;s, there is little grief; they &s;ee their friend fall without any of that lamentation which is indulged in &s;ecurity and idlene&s;s, becau&s;e they have no lei&s;ure to &s;pare from the care of them&s;elves; and whoever &s;hall keep his thoughts equally bu&s;y, will find him|&s;elf equally unaffected with irretrievable lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>TIME is ob&s;erved generally to wear out &s;or|row, and its effects might doubtle&s;s be accele|rated by quickening the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and enlarg|ing the variety of objects. <Q><L>Si tempore longo</L>

<P>AMONG the innumerable follies, by which we lay up in our youth repen|tance and remor&s;e for the &s;ucceeding part of our lives, there is &s;carce any thing again&s;t which warnings are of le&s;s efficacy, than the neglect of health. When the &s;prings of mo|tion are in their full &s;trength, when the heart bounds with vigour, and the eye &s;parkles with &s;pirit, it is with difficulty, that we are taught to conceive the imbecillity and tenderne&s;s that every hour is bringing upon us, or to ima|gine, that the nerves which are now braced with &s;o much &s;trength, and the limbs which play with &s;o much activity, will lo&s;e all their power under the gripe of time, relax with numbne&s;s, and totter with debility.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="112">
AMONG the arguments which have been u&s;ed again&s;t complaints under the mi&s;eries of life, the philo&s;ophers have, I think, forgot to mention the incredulity of tho&s;e to whom we tell our &s;ufferings. But if the purpo&s;e of lamentation be to excite pity, and if pity mu&s;t pre&s;uppo&s;e &s;ympathy, it is &s;urely &s;uperflu|ous for age and weakne&s;s to tell their plaintive &s;tories; for a little attention will &s;hew them, that tho&s;e who do not feel pain, &s;eldom think that it is felt; and a &s;hort recollection will in|form almo&s;t every man, that he is only repaid the in&s;ult which he has given, &s;ince he may remember how often he has treated infirmity with contempt, mocked its cautions, and cen&s;ured its impatience.</P>
<P>THE valetudinarian race have made the care of health ridiculous by &s;uffering it to pre|vail over all other con&s;iderations, as the mi&s;er has brought frugality into contempt, by per|mitting the love of money not to &s;hare but to engro&s;s his mind: they both err alike, by confounding the means with the end; they gra&s;p at health only to be well, as at money only to be rich; and forget that every ter|re&s;trial advantage is chiefly valuable, as it fur|ni&s;hes abilities for the exerci&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">
HEALTH is, indeed, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all the duties, as well as plea&s;ures of life, that the crime of &s;quandering it is equal to the folly; and he that for the &s;ake of a few &s;hort gratifi|cations brings weakne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;es upon him&s;elf, and for the plea&s;ure of a few years pa&s;&s;ed in riot and noi&s;e, in the tumults of di|ver&s;ion, and clamours of merriment, con|demns the maturer and more experienced part of his life to the chamber and the couch, may be ju&s;tly reproached, not only as a &s;pendthrift of his own happine&s;s, but as a robber of the publick; as a wretch that has voluntarily di&s;|qualified him&s;elf for the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;tation, and refu&s;ed that part which providence a&s;&s;igns him in the general ta&s;k of human nature.</P>
<P>THERE are perhaps very few conditions more to be pitied than that of an active and elevated mind, labouring under the weight of a di&s;tempered body; the time of &s;uch a man is always &s;pent in forming &s;chemes, which a change of wind hinders him from executing, his powers fume away in projects and in hope, and the day of action never arrives. He lies down delighted with the thoughts of
<PB N="113" REF="114">
to-morrow, plea&s;es his ambition with the &s;ame he &s;hall acquire, or his benevolence with the good he &s;hall confer. But in the night the &s;kies are overca&s;t, the temper of the air is changed, he wakes in languor, impatience, and di&s;traction, and has no longer any wi&s;h but for ea&s;e, nor any attention but to mi&s;ery. It may be &s;aid that di&s;ea&s;e generally begins that equality which death completes; the di&s;tincti|ons which &s;et one man &s;o much above another are very little perceived in the gloom of a &s;ick chamber, where it will be in vain to expect entertainment from the gay, or in&s;truction from the wi&s;e, where all human glory is obli|terated, where the wit is clouded, the rea&s;on|ner embarra&s;&s;ed, and the hero &s;ubdued; where the highe&s;t and brighte&s;t of mortal beings finds nothing left him but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of in|nocence.</P>
<P>THERE is among the fragments of the Greek poets a &s;hort hymn to Health, in which her power of exalting the happine&s;s of life, of heightening the gifts of fortune, and ad|ding enjoyment to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is inculcated with &s;o much force and beauty, that no one, at lea&s;t no one who has ever langui&s;hed under the di&s;comforts and infirmities of a lingering
<PB N="114" REF="115">
di&s;ea&s;e, can read it without feeling the images dance in his heart, and adding from his own experience new vigour to the wi&s;h, and from his own imagination new colours to the pic|ure. The particular occa&s;ion of this little com|po&s;ition is not known, but it is probable that the author had been &s;ick, and in the fir&s;t rap|tures of returning vigour addre&s;&s;ed Health in the following manner: <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="13 lines"></Q>
<Q>HEALTH, mo&s;t venerable of the powers of heaven! with thee may the remaining part of my life be pa&s;&s;ed, nor do thou refu&s;e to ble&s;s me with thy re&s;idence. For whatever there is of beauty or of plea&s;ure in wealth, in de&s;cendants, or in &s;overeign command the highe&s;t &s;ummit of hu|man enjoyment, or in tho&s;e objects of de&s;ire which
<PB N="115" REF="116">
we endeavour to cha&s;e into the toils of love; whatever delight, or whatever &s;olace is granted by the cele&s;tials to &s;often our fatigues, in thy pre|&s;ence, thou parent of happine&s;s, all tho&s;e joys &s;pread out and flouri&s;h; in thy pre&s;ence blooms the &s;pring of plea&s;ure, and without thee there is no gladne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH is the power of health, that with|out its cooperation every other comfort is tor|pid and lifele&s;s, as the powers of vegetation without the &s;un. And yet this bli&s;s is com|monly thrown away in thoughtle&s;s negligence, or in fooli&s;h experiments on our own &s;trength; we let it peri&s;h without remembring its value, or wa&s;te it to &s;hew how much we have to &s;pare; it is &s;ometimes given up to the ma|nagement of levity and chance, and &s;ome|times &s;old for the applau&s;e of jollity and de|bauchery.</P>
<P>HEALTH is equally neglected, and with equal impropriety, by the votaries of bu&s;ine&s;s and the followers of plea&s;ure. Some men ru|in the fabrick of their bodies by ince&s;&s;ant re|vels, and others by intemperate &s;tudies; &s;ome batter it by exce&s;s, and others &s;ap it by inacti|vity. To the noi&s;y rout of bacch analian rio|ters it will be to little purpo&s;e that advice is
<PB N="116" REF="117">
offered, though it requires no great abilities to prove, that he lo&s;es plea&s;ure who lo&s;es health; their clamours are too loud for the whi&s;pers of caution, and they run the cour&s;e of life with too much precipitance to &s;top at the call of wi&s;dom. Nor perhaps will they that are bu&s;ied in adding thou&s;ands to thou&s;ands, pay much regard to him that &s;hall direct them to ha&s;ten more &s;lowly to their wi&s;hes. Yet &s;ince lovers of money are generally cool, deliberate and thoughtful, they might &s;urely con&s;ider, that the greater good ought not to be &s;acrifi|ced to the le&s;s. Health is certainly more va|luable than money, becau&s;e it is by health that money is procured; but thou&s;ands and mil|lions are of &s;mall avail to alleviate the pro|tracted tortures of the gout, to repair the bro|ken organs of &s;en&s;e, or re&s;u&s;citate the powers of dige&s;tion. Poverty is, indeed, an evil from which we naturally fly; but let us not run from one enemy to another, nor take &s;helter in the arms of &s;ickne&s;s. <Q><L>&mdash;Projecere animam! qu&agrave;m vellent aethere in alto</L>

they profe&s;s argument and reflection, they ought to know that the body is not forced be|yond its &s;trength, but with the lo&s;s of more vigour than is proportionate to the effect pro|duced; and that whoever takes up life before|hand, by depriving him&s;elf of re&s;t and refre&s;h|ment, mu&s;t not only pay back the hours, but pay them back with u&s;ury; and for the gain of a few months but half enjoyed, mu&s;t give up years to the li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of languor, and the implacability of pain; they who&s;e endeavour is mental excellence, will learn at la&s;t, perhaps too late, how much it is endangered by di&s;|ea&s;es of the body, and find that knowledge may ea&s;ily be lo&s;t in the &s;tarts of melancholy, the flights of impatience, and the peevi&s;hne&s;s of decrepitude.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="119">
of the earth. Immediately after our birth, thir&s;t and hunger incline us to the brea&s;t, whch we draw by in&s;tinct, like other young creatures, and, when we are &s;atisfied, we expre&s;s our unea&s;ine&s;s by importunate and ince&s;&s;ant cries, till we have obtained a place or po&s;ture proper for repo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE next call that rou&s;es us from a &s;tate of inactivity, is that of our pa&s;&s;ions; we quick|ly begin to be &s;en&s;ible of hope and fear, love and hatred, de&s;ire and aver&s;ion; the&s;e ari&s;ing from the power of compari&s;on and reflection extend their range wider, as our rea&s;on &s;trengthens, and our knowledge enlarges. At fir&s;t we have no thought of pain, but when we actually feel it; we afterwards begin to fear it, yet not before it approaches us very near|ly; but by degrees we di&s;cover it at a greater di&s;tance, and find it lurking in remote con&s;e|quences. Our terror in time improves into caution, and we learn to look round with vi|gilance and &s;olicitude, to &s;top all the avenues at which mi&s;ery can enter, and to perform or endure many things in them&s;elves toil&s;ome and unplea&s;ing, becau&s;e we know by rea&s;on, or by experience, that our labour will be over-balanced by the reward, that it will either

For this rea&s;on now de|&s;ires and artificial pa&s;&s;ions are by degrees pro|duced; and, from having wi&s;hes only in con|&s;equence of our wants, we begin to feel wants in con&s;equence of our wi&s;hes; we per&s;uade our&s;elves to &s;et a value upon things which are of no u&s;e, but becau&s;e we have agreed to va|lue them; things which can neither &s;atisfy hunger, nor mitigate pain, nor &s;ecure us from any real calamity, and which, therefore, we find of no e&s;teem among tho&s;e nations who&s;e artle&s;s and barbarous manners keep them al|ways anxious for the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>THIS is the original of avarice, vanity, ambition, and generally of all tho&s;e de&s;ires
<PB N="120" REF="121">
which ari&s;e from the compari&s;on of our con|dition with that of others. He that thinks him&s;elf poor, becau&s;e his neighbour is richer; he that like Cae&s;ar would rather be the fir&s;t man of a village than the &s;econd in the capital of the world, has apparently kindled in him|&s;elf de&s;ires which he never received from na|ture, and acts upon principles e&s;tabli&s;hed only by the authority of cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>OF tho&s;e ad&s;cititious pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome, as a|varice and envy, are univer&s;ally condemned; &s;ome, as friend&s;hip and curio&s;ity, generally prai&s;ed; but there are others about which the &s;uffrages of the wi&s;e are divided, and of which it is doubted, whether they tend mo&s;t to pro|mote the happine&s;s, or increa&s;e the mi&s;eries of mankind.</P>
<P>OF this ambiguous and di&s;putable kind is the love of fame, a de&s;ire of filling the minds of others with admiration, and of being cele|brated by generations to come with prai&s;es which we &s;hall not hear. This ardour has been con&s;idered by &s;ome, as nothing better than &s;plendid madne&s;s, as a flame kindled by pride, and fanned by folly; for what, &s;ay they, can be more remote from wi&s;dom, than to di|rect
<PB N="121" REF="122">
all our actions by the hope of that which is not to exi&s;t till we our&s;elves are in the grave? To pant after that which can never be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and of which the value thus wild|ly put upon it, ari&s;es from this particular con|dition, that, during life, it is not to be obtain|ed? To gain the favour, and hear the applau&s;es of our contemporaries, is indeed equally de&s;ir|able with any other prerogative of &s;uperiori|ty, becau&s;e fame may be of u&s;e to &s;mooth the paths of life, to terrify oppo&s;ition, and fortify tranquillity; but to what end &s;hall we be the darlings of mankind, when we can no longer receive any benefits from their favour? It is more rea&s;onable to wi&s;h for reputation while it may be yet enjoyed, as Anacreon calls upon his companions to give him for pre&s;ent u&s;e the wine and garlands which they purpo&s;e to be|&s;tow upon his tomb.</P>
<P>THE advocates for the love of fame allege in its vindication, that it is a pa&s;&s;ion natural and univer&s;al; a flame lighted by heaven, and always burning with greate&s;t vigour in the mo&s;t enlarged and elevated minds. That the de&s;ire of being prai&s;ed by po&s;terity implies a re&s;olution to de&s;erve their prai&s;es, and that the folly charged upon it, is only a noble and
<PB N="122" REF="123">
di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity, which is not felt, and therefore not under&s;tood by tho&s;e who have been always accu&s;tomed to refer every thing to them&s;elves, and who&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s has con|tracted their under&s;tandings. That the &s;oul of man, formed for eternal life, naturally &s;prings forward beyond the limits of corporeal exi&s;tence, and rejoices to con&s;ider her&s;elf as cooperating with future ages, and as coex|tended with endle&s;s duration. That the cen|&s;ure urged with &s;o much petulance, the re|proach of labouring for what cannot be en|joyed, is founded on an opinion which may with great probability be que&s;tioned; for &s;ince we &s;uppo&s;e the powers of the &s;oul to be en|larged by its &s;eparation, why &s;hould we con|clude that its knowledge of &s;ublunary tran&s;ac|tions is contracted or extingui&s;hed?</P>
<P>UPON an attentive and impartial review of the argument, it will appear that the love of fame is to be regulated, rather than extingui&s;h|ed; and that men &s;hould be taught not to be wholly carele&s;s about their memory, but to endeavour that they may be remembered chiefly for their virtues, &s;ince no other repu|tation will be able to tran&s;mit any plea&s;ure be|yond the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
IT is evident that fame, con&s;idered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> as the immortality of a name, is not le&s;s like|ly to be the reward of bad actions than of good; and that therefore he has no certain principle for the regulation of his conduct, who&s;e &s;ingle aim is not to be forgotten; and hi&s;|tory will inform us, that this blind and undi&s;|tingui&s;hing appetite of renown has always been uncertain in its effects, and directed by acci|dent or opportunity, indifferently to the be|nefit or deva&s;tation of the world. When The|mi&s;tocles complained that the trophies of Mil|tiades hindered him from &s;leep, he was ani|mated by them to perform the &s;ame &s;ervices in the &s;ame cau&s;e. But Cae&s;ar, when he wept at the &s;ight of Alexander's picture, having no hone&s;t opportunities of action, let his ambiti|on break out to the ruin of his country.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, the love of &s;ame is &s;o far in|dulged by the mind as to become independent and predominant, it is dangerous and irregular; but it may be u&s;efully employed as an inferior and &s;econdary motive, and will &s;erve &s;ome|times to revive our activity when we begin to langui&s;h and lo&s;e &s;ight of that more certain, more valuable, and more durable reward, which ought always to be our fir&s;t hope and
<PB N="124" REF="125">
our la&s;t. But it mu&s;t be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds, that virtue is not to be per|&s;ued as one of the means to fame, but fame to be accepted as the only recompence which mortals can be&s;tow on virtue; to be accepted with complacence, but not &s;ought with eager|ne&s;s. Simply to be remembered is no advan|tage; it is a privilege which &s;atire as well as panegyric can confer, and is not more enjoy|ed by Titus or Con&s;tantine, than by Timocre|on of Rhodes, of whom we only know from his epitaph, <HI>that he had eaten many a meal, drank many a flaggon, and uttered many a re|proach.</HI> <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 lines"></Q></P>
<P>THE true &s;atisfaction which is to be drawn from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we &s;hall &s;hare the attention of future times, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the hope, that, with our name, our virtues will be propagated; and that tho&s;e whom we can|not benefit in our lives, may receive in&s;tructi|on from our examples, and incitement from our renown.</P>

<P>I HAVE always thought it the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who turn their &s;peculations upon the living world, to admire and commend the virtues, as well as to expo&s;e and cen&s;ure the faults of their contemporaries, and to confute a fal&s;e as well as to &s;upport a ju&s;t accu&s;ation; not only becau&s;e it is peculiarly the bu&s;ine&s;s of a monitor to keep his own reputation with|out taint, le&s;t tho&s;e who can once charge him with partiality, &s;hould indulge them&s;elves afterwards in di&s;believing him at plea&s;ure; but becau&s;e he may find real crimes &s;ufficient to give full employment to caution or repen|tance, without di&s;tracting the mind by need|le&s;s &s;cruples and vain &s;olicitudes.</P>
<P>THERE are certain fixed and &s;tated reproach|es that one part of mankind has in all ages
<PB N="126" REF="127">
thrown upon another, which are regularly tran&s;mitted through continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, and which he that has once &s;uffered them is cer|tain to u&s;e with the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hing ve|hemence, when he has changed his &s;tation, and gained the pre&s;criptive right of impo&s;ing on others, what he had formerly endured him&s;elf.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e hereditary imputations, of which no man &s;ees the ju&s;tice, till it becomes his in|tere&s;t to &s;ee it, very little regard is to be &s;hewn; &s;ince it does not appear that they are produced by ratiocination or enquiry, but re|ceived implicitly, or caught by a kind of in|&s;tantaneous contagion, and &s;upported rather by willingne&s;s to credit, than ability to prove them.</P>
<P>IT has been, in all ages of the world, the practice of tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to believe them&s;elves made venerable by length of time, to cen&s;ure the new comers into life, for want of re&s;pect to grey hairs and &s;age experience, for heady con&s;idence in their own under&s;tand|ings, for ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions upon partial views, for a contemptuous di&s;regard of tho&s;e &s;alutary coun&s;els, which their fathers and grand&s;ires
<PB N="127" REF="128">
are always ready to afford them, and a rebelli|ous impatience of that &s;ubordination to which youth is condemned by nature, as nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;ecurity from tho&s;e evils into which it would be otherwi&s;e inevitably precipitated, by the ra&s;hne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, and the blindne&s;s of ignorance.</P>
<P>EVERY old man complains of the growing depravity of the world, of the petulance and in&s;olence of the ri&s;ing generation. He re|counts the decency and regularity of former times, and celebrates the di&s;cipline and &s;obriety of the age in which his youth was pa&s;&s;ed; a happy age which is now no more to be ex|pected, &s;ince confu&s;ion has broke in upon the world, and thrown down all the boundaries of civility, reverence, and obedience.</P>
<P>IT is not always &s;ufficiently con&s;idered how much he a&s;&s;umes, who dares to claim the pri|vilege of complaining: for as every man has in his own opinion a full &s;hare of the mi&s;e|ries of life, he is inclined to con&s;ider all cla|morous unea&s;ine&s;s, as a proof of impatience rather than of affliction, and to a&s;k, What me|rit has this man to &s;how, by which he has ac|quired a right to repine at the di&s;tributions of
<PB N="128" REF="129">
nature? Or why does he imagine that exemp|tions &s;hould be granted him from the general condition of man? We find our&s;elves excited rather to captiou&s;ne&s;s than pity, and in&s;tead of being in ha&s;te to &s;ooth his complaints by &s;ym|pathy and tenderne&s;s, we enquire, whether the pain be proportionate to the lamentation, and whether, &s;uppo&s;ing his afflictions real, they are not the effect of vice and folly, rather than of calamity.</P>
<P>THE querulou&s;ne&s;s and indignation which is ob&s;erved &s;o often to disfigure the la&s;t &s;cene of life, naturally leads us to enquiries like the&s;e. For &s;urely it will be thought at the fir&s;t view of things, that if age be thus con|temned and ridiculed, in&s;ulted and neglected, the crime mu&s;t at lea&s;t be equal on either part; &s;ince they who have had &s;o many opportuni|ties of e&s;tabli&s;hing their authority over minds ductile and unre&s;i&s;ting, they who have been the protectors of helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the in&s;truct|ors of ignorance, and who yet retain in their own hands the power of wealth, and the dig|nity of command, mu&s;t defeat their influence by their own mi&s;conduct, and make u&s;e of all the&s;e advantages with very little &s;kill, if they can|not &s;ecure to them&s;elves an appearance of re|&s;pect,
<PB N="129" REF="130">
and ward off open mockery, and declar|ed contempt.</P>
<P>THE general &s;tory of mankind will evince, that lawful and &s;ettled authority is very &s;eldom re&s;i&s;ted when it is well employed, and that gro&s;s corruption, or evident imbecillity is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the conque&s;t of that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with which the majority of mankind look upon their governors, on tho&s;e whom they &s;ee &s;ur|rounded by &s;plendor, and fortified by power: for tho' men are drawn by their pa&s;&s;ions into forgetfulne&s;s of invi&s;ible rewards and puni&s;h|ments, yet they are ea&s;ily kept obedient to tho&s;e who have temporal dominion in their hands, till their veneration is di&s;&s;ipated by &s;uch wickedne&s;s and folly as can neither be de|fended, palliated nor concealed.</P>
<P>IT may, therefore, very rea&s;onably be &s;u&s;|pected that the old draw upon them&s;elves the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e in&s;ults, which they &s;o much lament, and that age is rarely de&s;pi&s;ed but when it is contemptible. If men imagine that exce&s;s or debauchery can be made reve|rend by time, that knowledge is the con&s;e|quence of long life however idly and thought|le&s;ly employed, that priority of birth will &s;up|ply
<PB N="130" REF="131">
the want of &s;teadine&s;s or hone&s;ty, and that the regard will be paid to wrinkles, which is due only to wi&s;dom, can it rai&s;e much won|der that their hopes are di&s;appointed, and that they &s;ee their po&s;terity rather willing to tru&s;t their own eyes in their progre&s;s into life, than enli&s;t them&s;elves under guides who have lo&s;t their way?</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, many truths which time nece&s;&s;arily and certainly teaches, and which might, by tho&s;e who have learned them from experience, be communicated to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors at a cheaper rate: but dictates, though liberally enough be&s;towed, are gene|rally without effect, becau&s;e they are &s;eldom re|commended by &s;ufficient authority; the teach|er gains few pro&s;elytes by in&s;truction which his own behaviour contradicts; young men mi&s;s the benefit of coun&s;el, becau&s;e they want the more powerful attraction of exam|ple, and are not very ready to believe that tho&s;e who fall below them in practice, can much excel them in theory. Thus the pro|gre&s;s of mankind in knowledge is retarded, the world is kept long in the &s;ame &s;tate, and every new race is to gain the prudence of their
<PB N="131" REF="132">
predece&s;&s;ors by commiting and redre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame mi&s;carriages.</P>
<P>TO &s;ecure to the old that influence which they are willing to claim, and which might &s;o much contribute to the improvement of the arts of life, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they give them&s;elves up to the duties of declining years; and contentedly re&s;ign to youth its le|vity, its plea&s;ures, its frolicks, and its &s;oppe|ries. It is a lifele&s;s endeavour to unite the con|trarieties of &s;pring and winter, and unju&s;t to claim the privileges of age, and retain the play-things of childhood. Young men al|ways form magnificent ideas of the wi&s;dom and gravity of tho&s;e, whom they con&s;ider as pla|ed at a di&s;tance from them in the ranks of ex|i&s;tence, and naturally look on tho&s;e whom they find tri&s;&s;ing with long beards, and luxurious and vain on the brink of the grave, with contempt and indignation, like that which women feel at the effeminacy of men. If dotards will contend with boys in tho&s;e performances in which boys mu&s;t always excel them; if they will dre&s;s crippled limbs in embroidery, and endeavour at gayety with faltering voices; if they will drag infirmity to the ball, and darken a&s;&s;emblies of plea&s;ure with the gha&s;tli|ne&s;s
<PB N="132" REF="133">
of di&s;ea&s;e, they may well expect that tho&s;e who find their diver&s;ions ob&s;tructed will hoot them away; and that if they de&s;cend to competition with youth, they mu&s;t bear the in&s;olence of &s;ucce&s;sful rivals. <Q><L>Lu&s;i&s;ti &s;atis, edi&s;ti &s;atis atque bibi&s;ti:</L>

<P>ANOTHER vice of age, by which the ri&s;ing generation may be alienated from it, is &s;everi|ty and cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s; a di&s;po&s;ition of mind that gives no allowance to the failings of early life, that expects artfulne&s;s from childhood, and con&s;tancy from youth, that is peremptory in every command, and inexorable to every failure. There are many who live merely to hinder happine&s;s, and who&s;e de&s;cendants can only tell of long life, that it produces &s;u&s;pi|cion, malignity, peevi&s;hne&s;s and per&s;ecution: and yet even they can talk of the ingratitude of the age, cur&s;e their heirs for impatience, and wonder that young men cannot take plea|&s;ure in their fathers' company.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have allowed a place in your pa|per to Euphelia's letters from the country, and appear to think no form of hu|man life unworthy of your attention, I have re&s;olved, after many &s;truggles with idlene&s;s and diffidence, to give you &s;ome account of my entertainment in this &s;ober &s;ea&s;on of univer&s;al retreat, and to de&s;cribe to you the employ|ments of tho&s;e who look with contempt on the plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions of polite life, and em|ploy all their powers of cen&s;ure and invective
<PB N="134" REF="135">
upon the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s, vanity, and folly of dre&s;s, vi&s;its, and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>WHEN a tire&s;ome and vexatious journey of four days had brought me to the hou&s;e, where an invitation, regularly &s;ent for &s;even years to|gether, had at la&s;t induced me to pa&s;s the &s;ummer, I was &s;urpri&s;ed, after the civilities of my fir&s;t reception, to find, in&s;tead of the lei&s;ure and tranquillity, which a rural life al|ways promi&s;es, and, if well conducted, might always afford, a confu&s;ed wildne&s;s of care, and a tumultuous hurry of diligence, by which every face was clouded, and every motion agitated. The old lady, who is my father's relation, was, indeed, very full of the happi|ne&s;s which &s;he received from my vi&s;it, and, according to the forms of ob&s;olete breeding, in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould recompen&s;e the long de|lay of my company with a promi&s;e not to leave her till winter. But, amid&s;t all her kindne&s;s and care&s;&s;es, &s;he very frequently turned her head a&s;ide, and whi&s;pered, with an|xious earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;ome order to her daughters which never failed to &s;end them out with unpo|lite precipitation. Sometimes her impatience would not &s;uffer her to &s;tay behind; &s;he beg|ged my pardon, &s;he mu&s;t leave me for a mo|ment;
<PB N="135" REF="136">
&s;he went, and returned and &s;at down again, but was again di&s;turbed by &s;ome new care, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her daughters with the &s;ame trepidation, and followed them with the &s;ame countenance of bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>HOWEVER I was alarmed at this &s;how of eagerne&s;s and di&s;turbance, and however my curio&s;ity was excited by &s;uch bu&s;y preparations as naturally promi&s;ed &s;ome great event, I was yet too much a &s;tranger to gratify my&s;elf with enquiries; but finding none of the family in mourning, I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with imagining that I &s;hould rather &s;ee a wedding than a funeral.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t we &s;at down to &s;upper, when I was informed that one of the young ladies, after whom I thought my&s;elf obliged to enquire, was under a nece&s;&s;ity of attending &s;ome affair that could not be neglected: &s;oon after my re|lation began to talk of the regularity of her family, and the inconvenience of London hours; and at la&s;t let me know that they had purpo&s;ed that night to go to bed &s;ooner than was u&s;ual, becau&s;e they were to ri&s;e early in the morning to make chee&s;ecakes. This hint &s;ent me to my chamber, to which I was accompa|nied
<PB N="136" REF="137">
by all the ladies, who begged me to ex|cu&s;e &s;ome large &s;ieves of leaves and flowers that covered two thirds of the floor, for they intended to di&s;til them when they were dry, and they had no other room that &s;o conveni|ently received the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>THE &s;cent of the plants hindered me from re&s;t, and therefore I ro&s;e early in the morning with a re&s;olution to explore my new habitati|on. I &s;tole unperceived by my bu&s;y cou&s;ins into the garden, where I found nothing either more great or elegant, than in the &s;ame num|ber of acres cultivated for the market. Of the gardener I &s;oon learned that his lady was the greate&s;t manager in that part of the coun|try, and that I was come hither at the time in which I might learn to make more pickles and con&s;erves, than could be &s;een at any other hou&s;e a hundred miles round.</P>
<P>IT was not long before her lady&s;hip gave me &s;ufficient opportunities of knowing her cha|racter, for &s;he was too much plea&s;ed with her own accompli&s;hments to conceal them, and took occa&s;ion, from &s;ome &s;weetmeats which &s;he &s;et next day upon the table, to di&s;cour&s;e for two long hours upon robs and gellies;
<PB N="137" REF="138">
laid down the be&s;t methods of con&s;erving, re|&s;erving, and pre&s;erving all &s;orts of fruit; told us with great contempt of the London lady in the neighbourhood, by whom the&s;e terms were very often confounded; and hinted how much &s;he &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;et before com|pany, at her own hou&s;e, &s;weetmeats of &s;o dark a colour as &s;he had often &s;een at mi&s;tre&s;s Sprightly's.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of her life, to watch the &s;killet on the fire, to &s;ee it &s;immer with the due degree of heat, and to &s;natch it off at the moment of projection; and the employments to which &s;he has bred her daughters, are to turn ro&s;e-leaves in the &s;hade, to pick out the &s;eeds of currants with a quill, to gather fruit without brui&s;ing it, and to ex|tract bean-flower water for the &s;kin. Such are the ta&s;ks with which every day, &s;ince I came hither, has begun and ended, to which the early hours of life are &s;acrificed, and in which that time is pa&s;&s;ing away which never &s;hall return.</P>
<P>BUT to rea&s;on or expo&s;tulate are hopele&s;s attempts. The lady has &s;ettled her opinions, and maintains the dignity of her own perfor|mances
<PB N="138" REF="139">
with all the firmne&s;s of &s;tupidity ac|cu&s;tomed to be flattered. Her daughters hav|ing never &s;een any hou&s;e but their own, be|lieve their mother's excellence on her own word. Her hu&s;band is a mere &s;port&s;man, who is plea&s;ed to &s;ee his table well furni&s;hed, and thinks the day &s;ufficiently &s;ucce&s;sful, in which he brings home a lea&s;h of hares to be potted by his wife.</P>
<P>AFTER a few days I pretended to want books, but my lady &s;oon told me that none of her books would &s;uit my ta&s;te; for her part &s;he never loved to &s;ee young women give their minds to &s;uch follies, by which they would only learn to u&s;e hard words; &s;he bred up her daughters to under&s;tand a hou&s;e, and who|ever &s;hould marry them, if they knew any thing of good cookery, would never repent it.</P>
<P>THERE are, however, &s;ome things in the culinary &s;cience too &s;ublime for youthful in|tellects, my&s;teries into which they mu&s;t not be initiated till the years of &s;erious maturity, and which are referred to the day of marriage, as the &s;upreme qualification for connubial life. She makes an orange pudding, which is the envy of all the neighbourhood, and
<PB N="139" REF="140">
which &s;he has hitherto found means of mix|ing and baking with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that the in|gredient to which it owes its flavour has ne|ver been di&s;covered. She, indeed, conducts this great affair with all the caution that hu|man policy can &s;ugge&s;t. It is never known beforehand when this pudding will be pro|duced; &s;he takes the ingredients privately into her own clo&s;et, employs her maids and daugh|ters in different parts of the hou&s;e, orders the oven to be heated for a pye, and places the pudding in it with her own hands, the mouth of the oven is then &s;topped, and all enquiries are vain.</P>
<P>THE compo&s;ition of the pudding &s;he has, however, promi&s;ed Clarinda, that if &s;he plea&s;|es her in marriage, &s;he &s;hall be told without re&s;erve. But the art of making Engli&s;h capers &s;he has not yet per&s;uaded her&s;elf to di&s;cover, but &s;eems re&s;olved that &s;ecret &s;hall peri&s;h with her, as &s;ome alchymi&s;ts have ob&s;tinately &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the art of tran&s;muting metals.</P>
<P>I ONCE ventured to lay my fingers on her book of receipts, which &s;he left upon the table, having intelligence that a ve&s;&s;el of goo&s;eberry wine had bur&s;t the hoops. But though the
<PB N="140" REF="141">
importance of the event &s;ufficiently engro&s;&s;ed her care, to prevent any recollection of the danger to which her &s;ecrets were expo&s;ed, I was not able to make u&s;e of the golden mo|ments; for this trea&s;ure of hereditary know|ledge was &s;o well concealed by the manner of &s;pelling u&s;ed by her grandmother, her mother, and her&s;elf, that I was totally unable to under|&s;tand it, and lo&s;t the opportunity of con&s;ul|ting the oracle, for want of knowing the lan|guage in which its an&s;wers were returned.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, nece&s;&s;ary, if I have any re|gard to her lady&s;hip's e&s;teem, that I &s;hould apply my&s;elf to &s;ome of the&s;e oeconomical ac|compli&s;hments; for I overheard her, two days ago, warning her daughters, by my mournful example, again&s;t negligence of pa&s;|try, and ignorance in carving: for you &s;aw, &s;aid &s;he, that, with all her preten&s;ions to knowledge, &s;he turned the partridge the wrong way when &s;he attempted to cut it, and, I believe, &s;carcely knows the difference between pa&s;te rai&s;ed, and pa&s;te in a di&s;h.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, Mr Rambler, why I have laid Lady Bu&s;tle's character before you, is a de&s;ire to be informed whether, in your opini|on,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
it is worthy of imitation, and whether I &s;hall throw away the books which I have hi|therto thought it my duty to read, for <HI>the la|dy's clo&s;et opened, the compleat &s;ervant-maid,</HI> and <HI>the court cook,</HI> and re&s;ign all curio&s;ity after right and wrong, for the art of &s;calding da|ma&s;cenes without bur&s;ting them, and pre&s;er|ving the whitene&s;s of pickled mu&s;hrooms.</P>
<P>LADY Bu&s;tle has, indeed, by this ince&s;&s;ant application to fruits and flowers, contracted her cares into a narrow &s;pace, and &s;et her&s;elf free from many perplexities with which other minds are di&s;turbed. She has no curio&s;ity af|ter the events of a war, or the fate of heroes in di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he can hear, without the lea&s;t e|motion, the ravage of a fire, or deva&s;tations of a &s;torm; her neighbours grow rich or poor, come into the world or go out of it, without regard, while &s;he is pre&s;&s;ing the gelly-bag, or airing the &s;tore-room; but I cannot perceive that &s;he is more free from di&s;quiets than tho&s;e who&s;e under&s;tandings take a wider range. Her marigolds when they are almo&s;t cured, are often &s;cattered by the wind, the rain &s;ome|times falls upon fruit when it ought to be ga|thered dry. While her artificial wines are fermenting, her &s;pirits are di&s;turbed with the
<PB N="142" REF="143">
utmo&s;t re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of anxiety. Her &s;weet-meats are not always bright, and the maid &s;ometimes forgets the ju&s;t proportions of &s;alt and pepper, when veni&s;on is to be baked. Her con&s;erves mould, her wines &s;our, and pickles mother; and, like all the re&s;t of mankind, &s;he is every day mortified with the defeat of her &s;chemes, and the di&s;appointment of her hopes.</P>
<P>WITH regard to vice and virtue &s;he &s;eems a kind of neutral being. She has no crime but luxury, nor any virtue but cha&s;tity; &s;he has no de&s;ire to be prai&s;ed but for her cookery, nor wi&s;hes any ill to the re&s;t of mankind, but that whenever they a&s;pire to a fea&s;t, their cu&s;|tards may be wheyi&s;h, and their pye-cru&s;ts tough.</P>
<P>I AM now very impatient to know whether I am to look on the&s;e ladies as the great pat|terns of our &s;ex, and to con&s;ider con&s;erves and pickles as the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life; whe|ther the cen&s;ures which I now &s;uffer be ju&s;t, and whether the brewers of wines, and the di&s;tillers of wa&s;hes, have a right to look with in&s;olence on the weakne&s;s of</P>

<P>AMONG the various methods of con&s;o|lation, to which the mi&s;eries in&s;epa|rable from our pre&s;ent &s;tate have given occa&s;i|on, it has been, as I have already remark|ed, recommended by &s;ome writers to put the &s;ufferer in mind of heavier pre&s;&s;ures, and more excruciating calamities, than tho&s;e of which he has him&s;elf rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>THIS has, in all ages, been directed and practi&s;ed; and, in conformity to this cu&s;tom, Lip&s;ius, the great modern ma&s;ter of the Stoic philo&s;ophy, has, in his celebrated treati&s;e on <HI>&s;teadine&s;s of mind,</HI> endeavoured to fortify the brea&s;t again&s;t too much &s;en&s;ibility of misfor|tune, by enumerating the great evils which have in former ages fallen upon the world, the deva&s;tation of wide-extended regions, the &s;ack of cities, and the ma&s;&s;acre of nations.
<PB N="144" REF="145">
And the common voice of the multitude un|in&s;tructed by precept, and unprejudiced by authority, which, in que&s;tions that relate to the heart of man, is, in my opinion, more deci&s;ive than the learning of Lip&s;ius, &s;eems to ju&s;tify the efficacy of this procedure; for one of the fir&s;t comforts which one neighbour ad|mini&s;ters to another, is a relation of the like infelicity, combined with circum&s;tances of greater bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT this medicine of the mind is like ma|ny remedies applied to the body, of which, though we &s;ee the effects, mo&s;t are unac|quainted with the manner of operation, and of which, therefore, &s;ome, who are unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e any thing out of the reach of their own &s;agacity, have been inclined to doubt whether they have really tho&s;e virtues for which they are celebrated, and whether their reputation is not the mere gift of fancy, pre|judice and credulity.</P>
<P>CONSOLATION, or comfort, are words which, in their proper acceptation, &s;ignify &s;ome alleviation of that pain to which it is not in our power to afford the proper and ad|equate remedy; they imply rather an aug|mentation
<PB N="145" REF="146">
of the power of bearing, than a diminution of the burthen. A pri&s;oner is re|lieved by him that &s;ets him at liberty, but re|ceives comfort from &s;uch as &s;ugge&s;ts con&s;ider|ations by which he is enabled to be more pa|tient under the inconvenience of confinement. To that grief which ari&s;es from a great lo&s;s he only brings the true remedy, who makes his friend's condition the &s;ame as before; but he may be properly termed a comforter, who by his coun&s;el and per&s;ua&s;ions extenuates the pain of poverty, and &s;hews, in the &s;tyle of <HI>He|&s;iod,</HI> that <HI>half is more than the whole.</HI></P>
<P>IT is, perhaps, not immediately obvious, how it can lull the memory of misfortune, or appea&s;e the throbbings of angui&s;h, to hear that others are more mi&s;erable; others, per|haps, unknown or wholly indifferent, who&s;e pro&s;perity rai&s;es no envy, and who&s;e fall can gratify no re&s;entment. Some topics of com|fort ari&s;ing, like that which gave hope and &s;pirit to the captive of Se&s;o&s;tris, from the perpetual vici&s;&s;itudes of life, and mutability of human affairs, may as properly rai&s;e the dejected as depre&s;s the proud, and have an im|mediate and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to exhilarate and revive. But how can it avail the man
<PB N="146" REF="147">
who langui&s;hes in the gloom of &s;orrow, with|out pro&s;pect of emerging into the &s;un&s;hine of chearfulne&s;s, to hear that others are &s;unk yet deeper in the dungeon of mi&s;ery, &s;hackled with heavier chains, and &s;urrounded with darker de&s;peration?</P>
<P>THE &s;olace ari&s;ing from this con&s;ideration &s;eems, indeed, the weake&s;t of all others, and is, perhaps, never properly applied, but in ca&s;es where there is no place for reflexions of more &s;peedy and plea&s;ing efficacy. But even from &s;uch calamities life is by no means free; a thou&s;and ills incurable, a thou&s;and lo&s;&s;es ir|reparable, a thou&s;and difficulties in&s;urmount|able, are known, or will be known, by all the &s;ons of men. Native deformity cannot be rectified, a dead friend cannot return, and the hours of youth trifled away in folly, or lo&s;t in &s;ickne&s;s, cannot be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>UNDER the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch melancholy it has been found u&s;eful to take a &s;urvey of the world, to contemplate the various &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s in which mankind are &s;truggling round us, and acquaint our&s;elves with the <HI>terribiles vi&s;u formae,</HI> the various &s;hapes of mi&s;ery, which make havock of terre&s;trial happine&s;s,
<PB N="147" REF="148">
range all corners almo&s;t without re&s;traint, trample down our hopes at the hour of harve&s;t, and when we have built our &s;chemes to the top, ruin their foundations.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t effect of this meditation is, that it furni&s;hes a new employment for the mind, and engages the pa&s;&s;ions to remoter objects; as kings have &s;ometimes freed them&s;elves from the turbulence of a &s;ubject too haughty to be governed, and too powerful to be cru&s;hed, by po&s;ting him in a di&s;tant province, till his popularity has &s;ub&s;ided, or his pride been re|pre&s;&s;ed. The attention is di&s;&s;ipated by variety, and acts more weakly upon any &s;ingle part, as that torrent may be drawn off to different channels, which, pouring down in one collect+ed body, cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. This &s;pecies of comfort is, therefore, u&s;ele&s;s in &s;evere pa|roxy&s;ms of corporal pain, when the mind is every in&s;tant called back to mi&s;ery, and in the fir&s;t &s;hock of any &s;udden evil; but will cer|tainly be of u&s;e again&s;t encroaching melan|choly, and a &s;ettled habit of gloomy thoughts.</P>
<P>IT is further advantageous as it &s;upplies us with opportunities of making compari&s;ons in our own favour. We know that very little
<PB N="148" REF="149">
of the pain, or plea&s;ure, which does not be|gin and end in our &s;en&s;es, is otherwi&s;e than relative; we are rich or poor, great or little, in proportion to the number that excel us, or fall beneath us, in any of the&s;e re&s;pects; and therefore, a man, who&s;e unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from reflection on any misfortune that throws him below tho&s;e with whom he was once equal, is comforted by finding that he is not yet lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT there is another kind of compari&s;on, le&s;s tending towards the vice of envy, very well illu&s;trated by an old poet, who&s;e &s;y&s;tem will not afford many rea&s;onable motives to content. 'It is,' &s;ays he, 'plea&s;ing to look from &s;hore upon the tumults of a &s;torm, and to &s;ee a &s;hip &s;truggling with the billows; it is plea&s;ing, not becau&s;e the pain of ano|ther can give us delight, but becau&s;e we have a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion of the happine&s;s of &s;afety.' Thus when we look abroad, and behold the multitudes that are groaning under evils heavier than tho&s;e which we have expe|rienced, we &s;hrink back to our own &s;tate, and in&s;tead of repining that &s;o much mu&s;t be felt, learn to rejoice that we have not more to feel.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
BY this ob&s;ervation of the mi&s;eries of others, fortitude is &s;trengthened, and the mind brought to a more exten&s;ive knowledge of her own powers. As the heroes of action catch the flame from one another, &s;o they to whom providence has allotted the harder ta&s;k of &s;uf|fering with calmne&s;s and dignity, may animate them&s;elves by the remembrance of tho&s;e evils which have been laid on others, perhaps natu|rally as weak as them&s;elves, and bear up with vigour and re&s;olution again&s;t their own op|pre&s;&s;ions, when they &s;ee it yet po&s;&s;ible that more &s;evere afflictions may be born.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;till another rea&s;on why, to many minds, the relation of other mens' infe|licity may give a la&s;ting and continual relief. Some, not well in&s;tructed in the mea&s;ures by which providence di&s;tributes happine&s;s, are per|haps mi&s;led by divines, who, as Bellarmine makes temporal pro&s;perity one of the charac|ters of the true church, have repre&s;ented wealth and ea&s;e as the certain concomitants of virtue, and the unfailing re&s;ult of the divine approbation. Such &s;ufferers are dejected in their misfortunes, not &s;o much for what they feel, as for what they dread; not becau&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="151">
they cannot &s;upport the &s;orrows, or endure the wants, of their pre&s;ent condition, but becau&s;e they con&s;ider them as only the begin|nings of more &s;harp and more la&s;ting pains. To the&s;e mourners it is an act of the highe&s;t charity to repre&s;ent the calamities which not only virtue has &s;uffered, but virtue has incur|red; to inform them that one evidence of a future &s;tate is the uncertainty of any pre&s;ent reward for goodne&s;s; and to remind them, from the highe&s;t authority, of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and penury of men <HI>of whom the world was not worthy.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is &s;carcely, among tho&s;e evils to which human life is expo&s;ed, any &s;o generally dreaded as poverty. Every other &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, tho&s;e, who are not much accu&s;tomed to di&s;turb the pre&s;ent moment with reflexion, can ea&s;ily forget, becau&s;e it is not always forced upon their regard: but it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s a day or an hour in the con|fluxes
<PB N="151" REF="152">
of men, without &s;eeing how much in|digence is expo&s;ed to contumely, neglect and in&s;ult; and, in its lowe&s;t &s;tate, to hunger and nakedne&s;s; to injuries again&s;t which every pa&s;&s;ion is in arms, and to wants which nature cannot &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>AGAINST other evils the heart is often hardened by true or by fal&s;e notions of digni|ty and reputation: thus we &s;ee dangers of eve|ry kind faced with willingne&s;s becau&s;e bravery, in a good or bad cau&s;e, is never without its encomia&s;ts and admirers. But in the pro&s;pect of poverty there is nothing but gloom and me|lancholy; the mind and body &s;uffer together; its mi&s;eries bring no alleviations; it is a &s;tate in which every virtue is ob&s;cured, and in which no conduct can avoid reproach; a &s;tate in which chearfulne&s;s is in&s;en&s;ibility, and de|jection &s;ullenne&s;s, of which the hard&s;hips are without honour, and the labours without re|ward.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e calamities there &s;eems not to be wanting a general conviction; we hear on every &s;ide the noi&s;e of trade, and &s;ee the &s;treets thronged with numberle&s;s multitudes, who&s;e faces are clouded with anxiety, and who&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="153">
&s;teps are hurried by precipitation, from no other motive than the hope of gain; and the whole world is put in motion, by the de&s;ire of that wealth, which is chiefly to be valued, as it &s;ecures us from poverty; for it is more u&s;e|ful for defence than acqui&s;ition, and is not &s;o much able to procure good as to exclude evil.</P>
<P>YET there are always &s;ome who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions or follies lead them to a conduct oppo&s;ite to the general maxims and practice of mankind; &s;ome who &s;eem to ru&s;h upon poverty, with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s with which others avoid it, who &s;ee their revenues hourly le&s;&s;ened, and the e&s;tates which they inherit from their ance&s;tors mouldering away, without re&s;olu|tion to change their cour&s;e of life; and per&s;e|vere again&s;t all remon&s;trances, and go for|ward with full career, though they &s;ee before them the precipice of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT is not my purpo&s;e, in this paper, to ex|po&s;tulate with &s;uch as ruin their fortunes by expen&s;ive &s;chemes of buildings and gardens, which they carry on with the &s;ame vanity that prompted them to begin, chu&s;ing, as it hap|pens in a thou&s;and other ca&s;es, the remote evil before the lighter, and deferring the
<PB N="153" REF="154">
&s;hame of repentance till they incur the mi&s;e|ries of di&s;tre&s;s. Tho&s;e for whom I intend my pre&s;ent admonitions, are the thoughtle&s;s, the negligent, and the di&s;&s;olute; who having, by the viciou&s;ne&s;s of their own inclinations, or the &s;educements of alluring companions, been engaged in habits of expence, and ac|cu&s;tomed to move in a certain round of plea|&s;ures di&s;proportioned to their condition, are without power to extricate them&s;elves from the enchantments of cu&s;tom, avoid thought becau&s;e they know it will be painful, and continue, from day to day, and from month to month, to anticipate their revenues, and &s;ink every hour deeper into the gulphs of u&s;u|ry and extortion.</P>
<P>THIS folly has le&s;s claim to pity, becau&s;e it cannot be imputed to the vehemence of &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion; nor can the mi&s;chief which it produces be extenuated as the effect of any &s;ingle act, which rage, or de&s;ire, might exe|cute before there could be time for an appeal to rea&s;on. The&s;e men are advancing towards mi&s;ery by &s;oft approaches, and de&s;troying them&s;elves, not by the violence of a blow, which, when once given, can never be re|called,
<PB N="154" REF="155">
but by a &s;low poi&s;on, hourly repeated, and ob&s;tinately continued.</P>
<P>THIS conduct is &s;o ab&s;urd when it is exa|mined by the unprejudiced eye of rational judgment, that nothing but experience could evince its po&s;&s;ibility; yet ab&s;urd as it is, the &s;udden fall of &s;ome families, and the &s;udden ri&s;e of others, prove it to be common; and every year &s;ees many wretches reduced to contempt and want, by their co&s;tly &s;acrifices to plea&s;ure and vanity.</P>
<P>IT is the fate of almo&s;t every pa&s;&s;ion, when it has pa&s;&s;ed the bounds which nature pre|&s;cribes, to counteract its own purpo&s;e. Too much rage hinders the warrior from circum|&s;pection, too much eagerne&s;s of profit hurts the credit of the trader, too much ardor takes away from the lover that ea&s;ine&s;s of ad|dre&s;s with which ladies are delighted. Thus extravagance, though dictated by vanity, and incited by voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;eldom procures ultimately either applau&s;e or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IF prai&s;e be ju&s;tly e&s;timated by the charac|ter of tho&s;e from whom it is received, little &s;atisfaction will be given to the &s;pendthrift by
<PB N="155" REF="156">
the encomiums which he purcha&s;es. For who are they that animate him in his per&s;uits, but young men, thoughtle&s;s and abandoned like him&s;elf, unacquainted with all on which the wi&s;dom of nations has impre&s;&s;ed the &s;tamp of excellence, and devoid alike of knowledge and of virtue? By whom in his profu&s;ion prai&s;ed, but by wretches who con&s;ider him as &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es, Sirens that entice him to &s;hipwreck, and Cyclops that are gaping to devour him?</P>
<P>EVERY man who&s;e knowledge, or who&s;e virtue, can give value to his opinion, looks with &s;corn, or pity, neither of which can af|ford much gratification to pride, on him whom the pandars of luxury have drawn into the circle of their influence, and whom he &s;ees parcelled out among the different mini&s;|ters of folly, and about to be torn to pieces by taylors and jockeys, vintners and attor|neys, by whom he is at once robbed and ri|diculed, and who are &s;ecretly triumphing over his weakne&s;s, when they pre&s;ent new incite|ments to his appetite, and heighten his de|&s;ire by counterfeited applau&s;e.</P>
<P>SUCH is the prai&s;e that is purcha&s;ed by pro|digality;
<PB N="156" REF="157">
even when it is yet not di&s;covered to be fal&s;e, it is the prai&s;e only of tho&s;e whom it is reproachful to plea&s;e, and who&s;e &s;incerity is corrupted by their intere&s;t, men who live by the riots which they encourage, and who know that when ever their pupil grows wi&s;e, they &s;hall lo&s;e their power. Yet with &s;uch flatteries, if they could la&s;t, might the cravings of vanity, which is &s;eldom very delicate, be &s;atisfied; but the time is always ha&s;tening forward when this triumph, poor as it is, &s;hall vani&s;h, and when tho&s;e who now &s;ur|round him with ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and compli|ments, fawn among his equipage, and ani|mate his rio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, &s;hall turn upon him with in&s;o|lence, and reproach him with the vices pro|moted by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AND as little preten&s;ions has the man, who &s;quanders his e&s;tate by vain or vicious expen|ces, to greater degrees of plea&s;ure than are ob|tained by others. To make any happine&s;s &s;incere, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we believe it to be la&s;ting: &s;ince whatever we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in danger of lo&s;ing, mu&s;t be enjoyed with &s;oli|citude and unea&s;ine&s;s, and the more value we &s;et upon it, the more mu&s;t the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion be imbittered. How can he then be en|vied

for his felicity, who knows that its con|tinuance cannot be expected, and who is con|&s;cious that a very &s;hort time will give him up to the gripe of poverty, which will be harder to be born, as he has given way to more ex|ce&s;&s;es, wantoned in greater abundance, and indulged his appetites with more profu&s;ene&s;s?</P>
<P>IT appears evident that frugality is nece&s;&s;ary even to complete the plea&s;ure of expence; for it may be generally remarked of tho&s;e who &s;quander what they know their fortune not &s;ufficient to allow, that in their mo&s;t jovial expence, there always breaks out &s;ome proof of di&s;content and impatience; they either &s;catter with a kind of wild de&s;peration, and affected lavi&s;hne&s;s, as criminals brave the gallows when they can|not e&s;cape it, or pay their money with a pee|vi&s;h anxiety, and endeavour at once to &s;pend idly, and to &s;ave meanly, having neither firmne&s;s to deny their pa&s;&s;ions, nor courage to gratify them, but murmuring at their own enjoyments, and poi&s;oning the bowl of plea|&s;ure by reflexion on the co&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE lately been called, from a ming|led life of bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement, to at|tend
<PB N="159" REF="160">
the la&s;t hours of an old friend; an office which has filled me, if not with melancholy, at lea&s;t with &s;erious reflexions, and turned my thoughts towards the contemplation of tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which, though of the utmo&s;t importance, and of indubitable certainty, are generally &s;ecluded from our regard, by the jollity of health, the hurry of employment, and even by the calmer diver&s;ions of &s;tudy and &s;peculation; or if they become accidental to|pics of conver&s;ation and argument, yet rare|ly &s;ink deep into the heart, but give occa&s;ion only to &s;ome &s;ubtilties of rea&s;oning, or &s;ome elegancies of declamation, which are heard, applauded, and forgotten.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, not hard to conceive how a man accu&s;tomed to extend his views through a long concatenation of cau&s;es and effects, to trace things from their origin to their period, and compare means with ends, may di&s;cover the weakne&s;s of human &s;chemes; detect the fallacies by which we are deluded; &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of wealth, honours, and power, to real happine&s;s; and plea&s;e him&s;elf, and his auditors with learned lectures on the vanity of life.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
BUT though the &s;peculati&s;t may &s;ee and &s;hew the folly of terre&s;trial hopes, fears, and de&s;ires, every hour will give proofs that he never felt it. Trace him through the paths of life, and you will find him acting upon principles which he has in common with un|enlightened mortals, angry and plea&s;ed like the lowe&s;t of the vulgar, per&s;uing, with the &s;ame ardor, the &s;ame de&s;igns, gra&s;ping, with all the eagerne&s;s of tran&s;port, tho&s;e riches which he knows he cannot keep, and &s;welling with the applau&s;e which he has gained by Proving that applau&s;e is of no value.</P>
<P>THE only conviction which ru&s;hes upon the &s;oul, and takes away from our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions the power of re&s;i&s;tance, is to be found, where I have received it, at the bed of a dying friend. To enter the &s;chool of wi&s;dom is not the peculiar privilege of geo|metricians; the mo&s;t &s;ublime and important precepts require no uncommon opportunities, nor laborious preparations, they are enforced without the aid of eloquence, and under&s;tood without &s;kill in analytic &s;cience. Every tongue can utter them, and every under&s;tand|ing can conceive them. He that wi&s;hes in
<PB N="161" REF="162">
earne&s;t to obtain ju&s;t &s;entiments concerning his condition, he that would be intimately ac|quainted with the world, may find in&s;truc|tions on every &s;ide; he that de&s;ires to enter behind the &s;cene, which every art has been employed to decorate, and every pa&s;&s;ion la|bours to illuminate, and to &s;ee life &s;tripped of tho&s;e ornaments which make it glitter on the &s;tage, and expo&s;ed in its natural meanne&s;s, impotence, and nakedne&s;s, may find all the delu&s;ion laid open in the chamber of di&s;ea&s;e; he will there find vanity dive&s;ted of her robes, power deprived of her &s;ceptre, and hypocri&s;y without her ma&s;k.</P>
<P>THE friend whom I have lo&s;t was a man eminent for genius, and, like others of the &s;ame cla&s;s, &s;ufficiently plea&s;ed with acceptance and applau&s;e. Being care&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who have preferments and riches in their di&s;po&s;al, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as in the direct road of advancement, and had caught the flame of ambition by approaches to its object. But in the mid&s;t of his hopes, his projects, and his gayeties, he was &s;eized by a lingering di&s;ea&s;e, which, from its fir&s;t &s;tage, he knew to be in|curable. Here was an end of all his vi&s;ions of greatne&s;s and happine&s;s; from the fir&s;t
<PB N="162" REF="163">
hour that his health declined, all his former plea&s;ures grew ta&s;tele&s;s. His friends expected to plea&s;e him by tho&s;e accounts of the growth of his reputation, which were formerly certain of being well received; but they &s;oon found how little he was now affected by compli|ments, and how vainly they attempted, by flattery, to exhilarate the languor of weakne&s;s, and relieve the &s;olicitude of approaching death. Whoever would know how much piety and virtue &s;urpa&s;s all external goods, might here have &s;een them weighed again&s;t each other, where all that gives motion to the active, and elevation to the eminent, all that &s;parkles in the eye of hope, and pants in the bo&s;om of &s;u&s;picion, at once became du&s;t in the balance, without weight and without regard. Riches, authority, and prai&s;e, lo&s;e all their influence when they are con&s;idered as riches which to|morrow &s;hall be be&s;tow'd upon another, au|thority which &s;hall this night expire for ever, and prai&s;e which, however merited, or how|ever &s;incere, &s;hall, after a few moments, be heard no more.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e hours of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and wi&s;dom, nothing appeared to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, or glad|den his heart, but the recollection of acts of
<PB N="163" REF="164">
goodne&s;s, nor to excite his attention but &s;ome opportunity for the exerci&s;e of the duties of religion. Every thing that terminated on this &s;ide of the grave was received with coldne&s;s and indifference, and regarded rather in con|&s;equence of the habit of valuing it, than from any opinion that it de&s;erved value; it had lit|tle more prevalence over his mind than a bub|ble that was now broken, a dream from which he was awake. His whole powers were engro&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ideration of another &s;tate, and all conver&s;ation was tedious, that had not &s;ome tendency to di&s;engage him from human affairs, and open his pro&s;pects into e|ternity.</P>
<P>IT is now pa&s;t, we have clo&s;ed his eyes, and heard him breathe the groan of expiration. At the &s;ight of this la&s;t conflict, I felt a &s;en&s;a|tion never known to me before; a confu&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ions, an awful &s;tilne&s;s of &s;orrow, a gloo|my terrour without a name. The thoughts that entered my &s;oul were too &s;trong to be di|verted, and too piercing to be endured; but &s;uch violence cannot be la&s;ting, the &s;torm &s;ub|&s;ided in a &s;hort time, I wept, retired, and grew calm.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
I have from that time frequently revolved in my mind, the effects which the ob&s;ervation of death produces, in tho&s;e who are not whol|ly without the power and u&s;e of reflexion; for by far the greater part it &s;eems to be whol|ly unregarded. Their friends and their ene|mies &s;ink into the grave without rai&s;ing any uncommon emotion, or reminding them that they are them&s;elves on the edge of the preci|pice, and that they mu&s;t &s;oon plunge into the gulph of eternity.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to me remarkable that death in|crea&s;es our veneration for the good, and exte|nuates our hatred of the bad. Tho&s;e virtues which once we envied, as Horace ob&s;erves, becau&s;e they eclip&s;ed our own, can now no longer ob&s;truct our reputation, and we have therefore no intere&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s their prai&s;e. That wickedne&s;s, which we feared for its ma|lignity, is now become impotent, and the man who&s;e name filled us with alarm, and rage, and indignation, can at la&s;t be con&s;idered only with pity, or contempt.</P>
<P>WHEN a friend is carried to his grave, we at once find excu&s;es for every weakne&s;s, and pal|liations
<PB N="165" REF="166">
of every fault; we recollect a thou|&s;and endearments, which before glided off our minds without impre&s;&s;ion, a thou&s;and favours unrepaid, a thou&s;and duties unperformed, and wi&s;h, vainly wi&s;h for his return, not &s;o much that we may receive, as that we may be&s;tow happine&s;s, and recompen&s;e that kindne&s;s which before we never under&s;tood.</P>
<P>THERE is not, perhaps, to a mind well in|&s;tructed, a more painful occurrence, than the death of one whom we have injured without reparation. Our crime &s;eems now irretrievea|ble, it is indelibly recorded, and the &s;tamp of fate is fixed upon it. We con&s;ider, with the mo&s;t afflictive angui&s;h, the pain which we have given, and now cannot alleviate, and the lo&s;&s;es which we have cau&s;ed, and now cannot compen&s;ate.</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame kind are the emotions which the death of an emulator or competitor pro|duces. Whoever had qualities to alarm our jealou&s;y, had excellence to de&s;erve our fond|ne&s;s, and to whatever ardor oppo&s;ition of inter|e&s;t may enflame us, no man ever outlived an enemy, whom he did not then wi&s;h to have made a friend. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in li|terary
<PB N="166" REF="167">
hi&s;tory know that the elder Scaliger was the redoubted antagoni&s;t of Cardan and Era&s;|mus; yet at the death of each of his great ri|vals he relented, and complained that they were &s;natched away from him before their re|conciliation was completed. <Q><L>Tu-ne etiam moreris? Ah! quid me linquis, Era&s;me,</L>
<L>Ante meus quam &s;it conciliatus amor?</L></Q></P>
<P>SUCH are the &s;entiments with which we at la&s;t review the effects of pa&s;&s;ion, but which we &s;ometimes delay till we can no longer rec|tify our errors. Let us therefore make ha&s;te to do what we &s;hall certainly at la&s;t wi&s;h to have done; let us return the care&s;&s;es of our friends, and endeavour by mutual endearments to heighten that tenderne&s;s which is the balm of life. Let us be quick to repent of injuries while repentance may not be a barren angui&s;h, and let us open our eyes to every rival excel|lence, and pay early and willingly tho&s;e ho|nours which ju&s;tice will compel us to pay at la&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have been but a little time conver&s;ant in the world, yet I have already had frequent opportunities of ob&s;er|ving the little efficacy of remon&s;trance and complaint, which, however extorted by oppre&s;|&s;ion, or &s;upported by rea&s;on, are dete&s;ted by one part of the world as rebellion, cen&s;ured by another as peevi&s;hne&s;s, by another heard with an appearance of compa&s;&s;ion, only to betray any of tho&s;e &s;allies of vehemence and re&s;ent|ment, which are apt to break out upon en|couragement, and by others pa&s;&s;ed over with indifference and neglect, as matters in which they have no concern, and which, if they &s;hould endeavour to examine or regulate, they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;chief upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="169">
YET &s;ince it is no le&s;s natural for tho&s;e who think them&s;elves injured to complain, than for others to neglect their complaints, I &s;hall venture to lay my ca&s;e before you, in hopes that you will enforce my opinion, if you think it ju&s;t, or endeavour to rectify my &s;en|timents, if I am mi&s;taken. I expect, at lea&s;t, that you will dive&s;t your&s;elf of partiality, and that whatever your age or &s;olemnity may be, you will not, with the dotard's in&s;olence, pronounce me ignorant and fooli&s;h, perver&s;e and refractory, only becau&s;e you perceive that I am young.</P>
<P>MY father dying when I was but ten years old, left me, and a brother two years younger than my&s;elf, to the care of my mother, a wo|man of birth and education, who&s;e prudence or virtue he had no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t. She felt, for &s;ome time, all the &s;orrow which na|ture calls forth, upon the final &s;eparation of per&s;ons dear to one another; and as her grief was exhau&s;ted by its own violence, it &s;ub&s;ided into tenderne&s;s for me and my brother, and the year of mourning was &s;pent in care&s;&s;es, con&s;olations, and in&s;truction, in celebration of my father's virtues, in profe&s;&s;ions of per|petual regard to his memory, and hourly in|&s;tances
<PB N="169" REF="170">
of &s;uch fondne&s;s as gratitude will not ea&s;ily &s;uffer me to forget.</P>
<P>BUT when the term of this mournful felici|ty was expired, and my mother appeared again without the en&s;igns of &s;orrow, the ladies of her acquaintance began to tell her, upon what|ever motives, that it was time to live like the re&s;t of the world; a powerful argument which is &s;eldom u&s;ed to a woman without ef|fect. Lady Giddy was ince&s;&s;antly relating the occurrences of the town, and Mrs Gravely told her privately, with great tenderne&s;s, that it began to be publickly ob&s;erved how much &s;he over-acted her part, and that mo&s;t of her acquaintance &s;u&s;pected her hope of procuring another hu&s;band to be the true ground of all that appearance of tenderne&s;s and piety.</P>
<P>ALL the officiou&s;ne&s;s of kindne&s;s and folly was bu&s;ied to change her conduct. She was at one time alarmed with cen&s;ure, and at an|other fired with prai&s;e. She was told of balls, where others &s;hone only becau&s;e &s;he was ab|&s;ent; of new comedies to which all the town was crouding; and of many ingenious ironies, by which dome&s;tick diligence was made con|temptibie.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="171">
IT is difficult for virtue to &s;tand alone again&s;t fear on one &s;ide, and plea&s;ure on the other; e&s;pecially when no actual crime is propo&s;ed, and prudence it&s;elf can &s;ugge&s;t many rea&s;ons for relaxation and indulgence. My mamma was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to accompany Mi&s;s Giddy to a play. She was received with a boundle&s;s profu&s;ion of compliment, and attended home by a very fine gentleman. Next day &s;he was with le&s;s difficulty prevailed on to play at Mrs Gravely's, and came home gay and lively; for the di&s;tinctions that had been paid her a|wakened her vanity, and good luck had kept her principles of frugality from giving her di&s;tur|bance. She now made her &s;econd entrance into the world, and her friends were &s;uffici|ently indu&s;trious to prevent any return to her former life; every morning brought me&s;&s;ages of invitation, and every evening was pa&s;&s;ed in places of diver&s;ion, from which &s;he for &s;ome time complained that &s;he had rather be ab&s;ent. In a &s;hort time &s;he began to feel the happine&s;s of acting without controul, of be|ing unaccountable for her hours, her expences, and her company; and learned, by degrees, to drop an expre&s;&s;ion of contempt, or pity, at the mention of ladies who&s;e hu&s;bands were &s;u&s;pected of re&s;training their plea&s;ures, or
<PB N="147" REF="172">
their play, and confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he loved to go and come as &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;till favoured with &s;ome incidental precepts and tran&s;ient endearments, and was now and then fondly ki&s;&s;ed for &s;miling like my papa: but mo&s;t part of her morning was &s;pent in comparing the opinion of her maid and milliner, contriving &s;ome variation in her dre&s;s, vi&s;iting &s;hops, and &s;ending conpliments; and the re&s;t of the day was too &s;hort for vi&s;its, cards, plays, and concerts.</P>
<P>SHE now began to di&s;cover that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to educate children properly at home. Parents could not have them always in their &s;ight; the &s;ociety of &s;ervants was contagious; company produced boldne&s;s and &s;pirit; emula|tion excited indu&s;try; and a large &s;chool was naturally the fir&s;t &s;tep into the open world. A thou&s;and other rea&s;ons &s;he alleged, &s;ome of lit|tle force in them&s;elves, but &s;o well &s;econded by plea&s;ure, vanity, and idlene&s;s, that they &s;oon overcame all the remaining principles of kind|ne&s;s and piety, and both I and my brother were di&s;patched to boarding &s;chools.</P>
<P>HOW my mamma &s;pent her time when &s;he
<PB N="172" REF="173">
was thus di&s;burthened I am not able to inform you, but I have rea&s;on to believe that trifles and amu&s;ements took &s;till fa&s;ter hold of her heart. At fir&s;t, &s;he vi&s;ited me at &s;chool, and afterwards wrote to me; but in a &s;hort time, both her vi&s;its and her letters were at an end, and no other notice was taken of me than to remit money for my &s;upport.</P>
<P>WHEN I came home, at the vacation, I found my&s;elf coldly received, with an ob&s;er|vation, "that this girl will pre&s;ently be a woman." I was, after the u&s;ual &s;tay, &s;ent to &s;chool again, and overheard my mother &s;ay, as I was a going, "Well, now I &s;hall recover."</P>
<P>IN fix months more I came again, and, with the u&s;ual childi&s;h alacrity, was running to my mother's embrace, when &s;he &s;topped me with exclamations at the &s;uddenne&s;s and enormity of my growth, having, &s;he &s;aid, never &s;een any body &s;hoot up &s;o much at my age. She was &s;ure no other girls &s;pread at that rate, and &s;he hated to have children look like women before their time. I was di&s;concerted, and retired without hearing any thing more than, "Nay if you are angry, madam Steeple, you may walk off."</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
WHEN once the forms of civility are viola|ted, there remains little hope of return to kind|ne&s;s or decency. My mamma made this ap|pearance of re&s;entment a rea&s;on for continu|ing her malignity, and poor Mi&s;s Maypole, for that was my appellation, was never men|tioned or &s;poken to but with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of anger or di&s;like.</P>
<P>SHE had yet the plea&s;ure of dre&s;&s;ing me like a child, and I know not when I &s;hould have been thought fit to change my habit, had I not been re&s;cued by a maiden &s;i&s;ter of my father, who could not bear to &s;ee women in hanging &s;leeves, and therefore pre&s;ented me with brocade for a gown, for which I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf under great obligations, had &s;he not ac|companied her favour with &s;ome hints that my mamma might now con&s;ider her age, and give me her ear-rings, which &s;he had &s;hewn long enough in publick places.</P>
<P>I NOW left the &s;chool and came to live with my mamma, who con&s;idered me as an u&s;urper that had &s;eized the rights of a woman without a ju&s;t claim, and was pu&s;hing her down the precipice of age that I might reign without
<PB N="174" REF="175">
a &s;uperior. While I am thus beheld with jea|lou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion, you will readily believe that it is difficult to plea&s;e. Every word and look is an offence. I never &s;peak, but I pre|tend to &s;ome qualities and excellences, which it is criminal to po&s;&s;e&s;s; if I am gay, &s;he thinks it early enough to coquette; if I am grave, &s;he hates a prude in bibs; if I venture into com|pany, I am in ha&s;te for a hu&s;band; if I retire to my chamber, &s;uch matron-like ladies are lovers of contemplation. I am on one pre|tence or other generally excluded from her a&s;|&s;emblies, nor am I ever &s;uffered to vi&s;it at the &s;ame place with my mamma. Every one won|ders why &s;he does not bring Mi&s;s more into the world, and when &s;he comes home in va|pours I am certain that &s;he has heard either of my beauty or my wit, and expect nothing for the en&s;uing week, but taunts and menaces, contradiction and reproaches.</P>
<P>THUS I live in a &s;tate of continual per&s;e|cution, only becau&s;e I was born ten years too &s;oon, and cannot &s;top the cour&s;e of nature or of time, but am unhappily a woman before my mother can willingly cea&s;e to be a girl. I believe you would contribute to the hap|pine&s;s of many families, if, by any arguments
<PB N="175" REF="176">
or per&s;ua&s;ions, you could make mothers a&s;ham|ed of rivalling their children; if you could &s;hew them, that though they may refu&s;e to grow wi&s;e, they mu&s;t inevitably grow old; and that the proper &s;olaces of age are not mu&s;ick and compliments, but wi&s;dom and devotion; that tho&s;e who are &s;o unwilling to quit the world will &s;oon be driven from it; and that it is therefore their intere&s;t to retire while there yet remain a few hours for nobler employ|ments.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more unplea&s;ing than to find that others have received offence when none was intended, and that pain has been given to tho&s;e who were not guilty of any provocation.

<P>NOR is it nece&s;&s;ary, that, to feel this unca|&s;ine&s;s, the mind &s;hould be extended to any great diffu&s;ion of genero&s;ity, or melted by any un|common warmth of benevolence; for that prudence which ri&s;es from ob&s;ervation of the world, and a quick &s;en&s;ibility of private inter|e&s;t, will ea&s;ily direct us to &s;hun needle&s;s enmi|ties; &s;ince there is no man who&s;e kindne&s;s we may not &s;ome time want, or by who&s;e ma|lice we may not &s;ome time &s;uffer.</P>
<P>I HAVE therefore frequently looked with re|aentment and wonder, and now and then with pity, at the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and folly with which &s;ome alienate from them&s;elves the affections of all whom chance, or bu&s;ine&s;s, or inclina|tion brings in their way. When we &s;ee a man pur&s;uing &s;ome darling intere&s;t, without much regard to the opinion of the world, though we may ju&s;tly con&s;ider him as corrupt and dangerous, we are not long in di&s;cover|ing

his motives; we &s;ee him actuated by pa&s;|&s;ions which are hard to be re&s;i&s;ted, and delu|ded by appearances which have dazzled &s;tron|ger eyes. But the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who &s;et mankind at defiance by hourly irritation, and who live but to infu&s;e malignity, and multiply enemies, have no hopes to fo&s;ter, no de&s;igns to promote, nor any expectations of attaining power by in&s;olence, or of climb|ing to greatne&s;s by trampling on others. They give up all the &s;weets of private kindne&s;s, and all the &s;atisfaction of general regard, for the &s;ake of peevi&s;hne&s;s, petulance, or gloom; by neglect of the common forms of civility, and breach of the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>EVERY one mu&s;t, in the walks of life, have met with men of whom all &s;peak with cen&s;ure, though they are not chargeable with any crime, and whom none can be per&s;waded to love, though no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why they &s;hould be hated; and who, if their good qualities and actions &s;ometimes force a com|mendation, have their panegyrick always concluded with confe&s;&s;ions of di&s;gu&s;t; "he is a good man, but I cannot like him." Surely &s;uch per&s;ons have &s;old the e&s;teem of the world at too low a price, &s;ince they have lo&s;t
<PB N="178" REF="179">
one of the rewards of virtue, without gaining the profits of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS ill economy of fame is &s;ometimes the effect of &s;tupidity. Men who&s;e perceptions are languid and &s;luggi&s;h, who lament nothing but lo&s;&s;es, and feel nothing but a blow, are of|ten at a difficulty to gue&s;s by what means they have encompa&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with enemies, though they lived in total neglect of all tho&s;e arts by which men are endeared to one ano|ther. They comfort them&s;elves that they have lived irreproachably; that none can charge them with having endangered his life, or dimini&s;hed his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and therefore conclude that they &s;uffer by &s;ome invincible fatality, or impute the malice of their neigh|bours to ignorance or envy. They wrap them&s;elves up in their innocence, and enjoy the congratulations of their own hearts, with|out knowing or &s;u&s;pecting that they are every day de&s;ervedly incurring re&s;entments, by withholding from tho&s;e with whom they con|ver&s;e, that regard, or appearance of regard, to which every one is entitled by the cu&s;toms of the world.</P>
<P>THERE are many injuries, which almo&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="180">
very man feels, though he does not complain and which, upon tho&s;e whom virtue, ele|gance, or vanity have made delicate and ten|der, fix deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions; as there are many arts of graciou&s;ne&s;s and conciliation, which are to be practi&s;ed without expence, and by which tho&s;e may be made our friends, who have never received from us any real be|nefit. Such arts, when they include neither guilt nor meanne&s;s, it is &s;urely rea&s;onable to learn; for who would want that love which is &s;o ea&s;ily to be gained? And &s;uch injuries are to be avoided; for who would be hated without profit?</P>
<P>SOME, indeed, there are, for whom the excu&s;e of ignorance or negligence cannot be alleged, becau&s;e it is apparent that they are not only carele&s;s of plea&s;ing but &s;tudious to offend; that they contrive to make all ap|proaches to them difficult and vexatious, and imagine that they aggrandize them&s;elves by wa&s;ting the time of others in u&s;ele&s;s atten|dance, by mortifying them with &s;lights, and teazing them with affronts.</P>
<P>Men of this kind, are generally to be found among tho&s;e that have not mingled much with
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the general ma&s;s of the community, but &s;pent their lives amid&s;t the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of depen|dants, and the flattery of para&s;ites; and have by long con&s;ulting only their own inclination, forgotten that others have an equal claim to the &s;ame deference.</P>
<P>TYRANNY thus avowed, is indeed an ex|uberance of pride, by which all mankind is &s;o much enraged, that it is never quietly en|dured, except in tho&s;e who can reward the patience which they exact; and in&s;olence is generally &s;urrounded only by &s;uch who&s;e ba&s;e|ne&s;s inclines them to think nothing in&s;upport|able that produces gain, and who can laugh at &s;currility and rudene&s;s with a luxurious ta|ble and an open pur&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT though all wanton provocations and contemptuous in&s;olence are to be diligently avoided, there is no le&s;s danger in timid com|pliance and tame re&s;ignation. It is common, for &s;oft and fearful tempers, to give them&s;elve; up implicitly to the direction of the bold, the turbulent, and the overbearing; of tho&s;e whom they do not believe wi&s;er or better than them|&s;elves; to recede from the be&s;t de&s;igns where
<PB N="181" REF="182">
oppo&s;ition mu&s;t be encountered, and to fall off from virtue for fear of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>SOME firmne&s;s and re&s;olution is nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;charge of duty; but it is a very un|happy &s;tate of life in which the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch &s;truggles frequently occurs; for no man is defeated without &s;ome re&s;entment, which will be continued with ob&s;tinacy while he be|lieves him&s;elf in the right, and exerted with bitterne&s;s if even to his own conviction he is detected in the wrong; and, though no regard were to be had to the con&s;equences of contra|riety and di&s;pute, it mu&s;t always be painful to a worthy mind to put others in pain, and there will be &s;ome danger le&s;t the kinde&s;t na|ture may be vitiated by too long a cu&s;tom of debate and conte&s;t.</P>
<P>I KNOW not whether I may not be taxed with in&s;en&s;ibility by many of my corre&s;pon|dents, who believe their contributions unju&s;t|ly neglected. And indeed when I &s;it before a pile of papers, of which each is the production of laborious &s;tudy, and the offspring of a fond parent, I, who know the pa&s;&s;ions of an au|thor, cannot remember how long they have lain in my boxes unregarded, without imagining
<PB N="182" REF="183">
to my&s;elf the various changes of &s;orrow, im|patience, and re&s;entment, which the writers mu&s;t have felt in this tedious interval.</P>
<P>THESE reflexions are &s;till more awakened, when, upon peru&s;al, I find &s;ome of them call|ing for a place in the next paper, a place which they have never yet obtained; others writing in a &s;tyle of &s;uperiority and haughti|ne&s;s, as &s;ecure of deference, and above all fear of critici&s;m; others humbly offering their weak a&s;&s;i&s;tance with &s;oftne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which they believe impo&s;&s;ible to be re&s;i&s;ted; &s;ome introducing their compo&s;itions with a menace of the contempt, which he that re|fu&s;es them will incur; others applying pri|vately to the book&s;ellers for their intere&s;t and &s;olicitation; every one by different ways en|deavouring to &s;ecure the bli&s;s of publication. I cannot but con&s;ider my&s;elf, as placed in a very incommodious &s;ituation, where I am for|ced to repre&s;s confidence, which it is plea&s;ing to indulge, to repay civilities with appearances of neglect, and &s;o frequently to offend tho&s;e by whom I never was offended.</P>
<P>I KNOW well how rarely an author, fired with the beauties of his new compo&s;ition,

contains his raptures in his own bo&s;om, and how naturally he imparts to his friends his ex|pectations of renown; and as I can ea&s;ily con|ceive the eagerne&s;s with which a new paper is &s;natched up, by one who expects to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it filled with his own production, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> perhaps has called his companions to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> plea&s;ure of a &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> grieve for the di&s;appointment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> at the fatal in&s;pection. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> however do not yet for&s;ake him; he is certain of giving lu&s;tre to the next day.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM always plea&s;ed when I &s;ee literature made u&s;eful, and &s;cholars de&s;cending from that elevation, which, as it rai&s;es them above common life, mu&s;t likewi&s;e hinder them from beholding the ways of men otherwi&s;e than in a cloud of bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion. Having lived a life of bu&s;ine&s;s, and remarked how &s;eldom any occurrences emerge for which great qualities are required, I have learned the nece&s;&s;ity of regarding little things, and though I do not pretend to give laws to the legi&s;lators
<PB N="185" REF="186">
of mankind, or to limit the range of tho&s;e powerful minds that carry light and heat through all the regions of knowledge, yet I have long thought, that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who lo&s;e them&s;elves in &s;tudies, by which I have not found that they grow much wi&s;er, might, with more advantage both to the pub|lick and them&s;elves, apply their under&s;tandings to dome&s;tick arts, and &s;tore their minds with axioms of humble prudence, and private eco|nomy.</P>
<P>YOUR late paper on frugality was very ele|gant and plea&s;ing, but, in my opinion, not &s;ufficiently adapted to common readers, who pay little regard to the mu&s;ick of periods, the artifice of connection, or the arrangement of the flowers of rhetoric; but require a few plain and cogent in&s;tructions, which may &s;ink into the mind by their own weight.</P>
<P>FRUGALITY is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of the world, &s;o beneficial in its various forms to every rank of men, from the highe&s;t of human potentates, to the lowe&s;t labourer or artificer; and the mi&s;eries which the ne|glect of it produces are &s;o numerous and &s;o grievous, that it ought to be recommended
<PB N="186" REF="187">
with every variation of addre&s;s, and adapted to every cla&s;s of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>WHETHER tho&s;e who treat morals as a &s;ci|ence will allow frugality to be numbered a|mong the virtues, I have not thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enquire. For I, who draw my opinions from a careful ob&s;ervation of the world, am &s;atisfied with knowing, what is a|bundantly &s;ufficient for practice, that if it be not a virtue, it is, at lea&s;t, a quality which can &s;eldom exi&s;t without &s;ome virtues, and without which few virtues can exi&s;t. Fruga|lity may be termed the daughter of prudence, the &s;i&s;ter of temperance, and the parent of li|berty. He that is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce depen|dence, and invite corruption; it will almo&s;t always produce a pa&s;&s;ive compliance with the wickedne&s;s of others; and there are few who do not learn by degrees to practi&s;e tho&s;e crimes which they cea&s;e to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>IF there are any who do not dread poverty as dangerous to virtue, yet mankind &s;eem una|nimous enough in abhorring it as de&s;tructive to happine&s;s; and all to whom want is ter|rible, upon whatever principle, ought to
<PB N="187" REF="188">
think them&s;elves obliged to learn the &s;age maxims of our par&s;imonious ance&s;tors, and attain the &s;alutary arts of contracting expence; for without frugality none can be rich, and with it very few would be poor.</P>
<P>TO mo&s;t other acts of virtue or exertions of wi&s;dom, a concurrence of many circum|&s;tances is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome previous knowledge mu&s;t be attained, &s;ome uncommon gifts of na|ture po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or &s;ome opportunity produced by an extraordinary combination of things; but the mere power of &s;aving what is already in our hands, mu&s;t be ea&s;y of acqui&s;ition to every mind; and as the example of Bacon may &s;hew, that the highe&s;t intellect cannot &s;afely neglect it, a thou&s;and in&s;tances will e|very day prove, that the meane&s;t may prac|ti&s;e it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>RICHES cannot be within the reach of great numbers, becau&s;e to be rich is to po&s;&s;e&s;s more than is commonly placed in a &s;ingle hand; and, if many could obtain the &s;um which now makes a man wealthy, the name of wealth mu&s;t then be transferred to &s;till greater accu|mulations. But I am not certain that it is equally impo&s;&s;ible to exempt the lower cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="188" REF="189">
of mankind from poverty; becau&s;e, though whatever be the wealth of the community, &s;ome will always have lea&s;t, and he that has le&s;s than any other is comparatively poor; yet I do not &s;ee any coactive nece&s;&s;ity that many &s;hould be without the indi&s;pen&s;able conveni|encies of life; but am &s;ometimes inclined to imagine, that, ca&s;ual calamities excepted, there might, by univer&s;al prudence, be pro|cured an univer&s;al exemption from want; and that he who &s;hould happen to have lea&s;t, might notwith&s;tanding have enough.</P>
<P>BUT without entering too far into &s;pecula|tions which I do not remember that any poli|tical calculator has attempted, and in which the mo&s;t per&s;picacious rea&s;oner may be ea&s;ily bewildered, it is certain that they to whom providence has allotted no other care but of their own fortune and their own virtue, which make far the greater part of mankind, have &s;ufficient incitements to per&s;onal frugality; &s;ince, whatever might be its general effect up|on provinces or nations, by which it is never likely to be tried, it is certain that there is &s;carcely any individual entering the world, who, by prudent par&s;imony, may not rea&s;ona|bly
<PB N="189" REF="190">
promi&s;e him&s;elf a chearful competence in the decline of life.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;pect of penury in age is &s;o gloo|my and terrifying, that every man who looks before him mu&s;t re&s;olve to avoid it; and it mu&s;t be avoided generally by the &s;cience of &s;paring. For, though in every age there are &s;ome, who by bold adventures, or by favour|able accidents ri&s;e &s;uddenly to riches, yet it is dangerous to indulge hopes of &s;uch rare e|vents: And the bulk of mankind mu&s;t owe their affluence to finall and gradual profits, be|low which their expence mu&s;t be re&s;olutely reduced.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not therefore think me &s;inking below the dignity of a practical philo&s;opher, when I recommend to the con&s;ideration of your readers, from the &s;tate&s;man to the appren|tice, a po&s;ition replete with mercantile wi&s;|dom, <HI>A penny &s;aved is two-pence got</HI>; which may, I think, be accommodated to all condi|tions, by ob&s;erving that not only they who pur&s;ue any lucrative employment will &s;ave time when they forbear expence, and that the time may be employed to the encrea&s;e of pro|&s;it; but they who are above &s;uch minute con|&s;iderations,
<PB N="190" REF="191">
will find, by every victory over appetite or pa&s;&s;ion, new &s;trength added to the mind, will gain the power of refu&s;ing tho&s;e &s;oli|citations by which the young and vivacious are hourly a&s;&s;aulted, and in time &s;et them&s;elves above the reach of extravagance and &s;olly.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be enquired by tho&s;e who are willing rather to cavil than to learn, what is the ju&s;t mea&s;ure of frugality? and when ex|pence, not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, degenerates into profu&s;ion? To &s;uch que&s;tions no gene|ral an&s;wer can be returned; &s;ince the liberty of &s;pending, or nece&s;&s;ity of par&s;imony, may be varied without end by different circum|&s;tances. It may, however, be laid down as a rule never to be broken, that <HI>a man's vo|luntary expence &s;hould not exceed his revenue.</HI> A maxim &s;o obvious and incontrovertible, that the civil law ranks the prodigal with the mad-man, and debars them equally from the con|duct of their own affairs. Another precept ari&s;ing from the former, and indeed included in it, is yet nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;tinctly impre&s;|&s;ed upon the warm, the fanciful, and the brave; <HI>Let no man anticipate uncertain profits.</HI> Let no man pre&s;ume to &s;pend upon hopes, to tru&s;t upon his own abilities for means of
<PB N="191" REF="192">
deliverance from penury, to give a loo&s;e to his pre&s;ent de&s;ires, and leave the reckoning to fortune or to virtue.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e cautions which, I &s;uppo&s;e, are, at lea&s;t among the graver part of mankind, un|di&s;puted, I will add another, <HI>Let no man &s;quan|der again&s;t his inclination.</HI> With this precept it may be, perhaps, imagined ea&s;y to comply; yet, if tho&s;e whom profu&s;ion has buried in pri&s;ons, or driven into bani&s;hment, were ex|amined, it would be found that very few were ruined by their own choice, or purcha&s;ed plea&s;ure with the lo&s;s of their e&s;tates; but that they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be born away by the violence of tho&s;e with whom they con|ver&s;ed, and yielded reluctantly to a thou&s;and prodigalities, either from a trivial emulation of wealth and &s;pirit, or a mean fear of con|tempt and ridicule; an emulation for the prize of folly, or the dread of the laugh of fools.</P>

<P>AS the love of money has been, in all ages, one of the pa&s;&s;ions that have gi|ven great di&s;turbance to the tranquillity of the world, there is no topick more copiou&s;ly treat|ed by the antient morali&s;ts than the folly of devoting the heart to the accumulation of riches; they who are acquainted with the&s;e au|thors need not be told how riches incite pity, contempt, or reproach, whenever they are mentioned; with what numbers of examples the danger of large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is illu&s;trated; and how all the powers of rea&s;on and elo|quence have been exhau&s;ted in a fruitle&s;s en|deavour to eradicate a de&s;ire, which &s;eems to have intrenched it&s;elf too &s;trongly in the mind to be driven out by argument or ridicule, and which, perhaps, had not lo&s;t its power, even over tho&s;e who declaimed mo&s;t vehemently again&s;t it, but would have broken out in the poet or the &s;age, if it had been excited by op|portunity,
<PB N="193" REF="194">
and invigorated by the approxima|tion of its proper object.</P>
<P>THEIR arguments have been, indeed, &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, that I know not whether it can be &s;hown, that by all the wit and rea&s;on which this favourite cau&s;e has called forth, a &s;ingle convert was ever made; that even one man has refu&s;ed to be rich, when to be rich was in his power, from the conviction of the greater happine&s;s of a narrow fortune; or di&s;burthened him&s;elf of wealth, when he had tried its inquietudes, merely to enjoy the peace, and lei&s;ure, and &s;ecurity, of a mean and unenvied &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT is true, indeed, that many have neglect|ed opportunities of rai&s;ing them&s;elves to ho|nours and to wealth, and rejected the kind|e&s;t offers of fortune: but, however their mo|deration may be boa&s;ted by them&s;elves, or ad|mired by &s;uch as only view them at a di&s;tance, it will be, perhaps, &s;eldom found that they value riches le&s;s, but that they dread labour, or danger, more than others; they are unable to rou&s;e them&s;elves to action, to &s;train in the race of competition, or to &s;tand the &s;hock of conte&s;t; but though they, therefore, decline
<PB N="194" REF="195">
the toil of climbing, they, neverthele&s;s, wi&s;h them&s;elves aloft, and would willingly enjoy what they dare not &s;eize.</P>
<P>OTHERS have retired from high &s;tations, and voluntarily condemned them&s;elves to pri|vacy and ob&s;curity; but, even the&s;e will not afford many occa&s;ions of triumph to the phi|lo&s;opher; for they have commonly either quit|ted that only which they thought them&s;elves unable to hold, and prevented di&s;grace by re|&s;ignation; or they have been induced to try new mea&s;ures by general incon&s;tancy, which always dreams of happine&s;s in novelty, or by a gloomy di&s;po&s;ition, which is di&s;gu&s;ted in the &s;ame degree with every &s;tate, and wi&s;hes every &s;cene of life to change as &s;oon as it is beheld; &s;uch men found high and low &s;tations equal|ly unable to &s;atisfy the wi&s;hes of a di&s;tem|pered mind, and were unable to &s;helter them|&s;elves in the clo&s;e&s;t retreat from di&s;appoint|ment, &s;olicitude, and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Yet though the&s;e admonitions have been thus neglected by tho&s;e, who either enjoyed riches, or were able to procure them, it is not ra&s;hly to be determined that they are alto|gether without u&s;e; for &s;ince far the greate&s;t

WEALTH is nothing in it&s;elf, it is not u&s;e|ful but when it departs from us, its value is found only in that which it can purcha&s;e, which, if we &s;uppo&s;e it put to its be&s;t u&s;e by tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s it, &s;eems not much to de&s;erve the de&s;ire or envy of a wi&s;e man.

Di&s;ea&s;e and infirmity &s;till continue to torture and enfeeble, perhaps exa&s;perated by luxury, or promoted by &s;oftne&s;s. With re|&s;pect to the mind, it has rarely been ob&s;erved, that wealth contributes much to quicken the di&s;cernment, enlarge the capacity, or elevate the imagination; but may, by hiring flattery, or laying diligence a&s;leep, confirm error, and harden &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>WEALTH cannot confer greatne&s;s, for no|nothing can make that great, which the de|cree of nature has ordained to be little. The bramble may be placed in a hot-bed, but can never become an oak. Even royalty it&s;elf is not able to give that dignity which it happens not to find, but oppre&s;&s;es feeble minds, though it may elevate the &s;trong. The world has

<P>IT is common to di&s;tingui&s;h men by the names of animals which they are &s;uppo|&s;ed to re&s;emble. Thus a hero is frequently termed a lion, and a &s;tate&s;man a fox, an ex|tortioner gains the appellation of vultur, and a fop the title of monkey. There is al&s;o a|mong the various anomalies of character, which a &s;urvey of the world exhibits, a &s;pe|cies of beings in human form, which may be properly marked out as the &s;creech-owls of mankind.</P>
<P>THESE &s;creech-owls &s;eem to be &s;ettled in an opinion that the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life is to complain, and that they were born for no o|ther purpo&s;e than to di&s;turb the happine&s;s of others, to le&s;&s;en the little comforts, and &s;hor|ten

the &s;hort plea&s;ures of our condition, by painful remembrances of the pa&s;t, or melan|choly progno&s;ticks of the future; their only care is to cru&s;h the ri&s;ing hope, to damp the kindling tran&s;port, and allay the golden hours of gayety with the hateful dro&s;s of grief and &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>TO tho&s;e, who&s;e weakne&s;s of &s;pirits, or ti|midity of temper, &s;ubjects them to impre&s;&s;ions from others, and who are apt to &s;uffer by fa&s;|cination, and catch the contagion of mi&s;ery, it is extremely unhappy to live within the compa&s;s of a &s;creech-owl's voice; for it will often fill their ears in the hour of dejection, terrify them with apprehen&s;ions, which their own thoughts would never have produced, and &s;adden, by intruded &s;orrows, the day which might have been pa&s;&s;ed in amu&s;ements, or in bu&s;ine&s;s; it will fill the heart with unne|ce&s;&s;ary di&s;contents, and weaken for a time that love of life which is nece&s;&s;ary to the vigo|rous pro&s;ecution of any undertaking.</P>
<P>THOUGH I have, like the re&s;t of mankind, many failings and weakne&s;&s;es, I have never yet, by either friends or enemies, been charg|ed with &s;uper&s;tition; I never count the com|pany
<PB N="202" REF="203">
which I enter, and I look at the new moon indifferently over either &s;houlder. I have, like mo&s;t other philo&s;ophers, often heard the cuckoo without money in my pocket, and have been &s;ometimes reproached as fool-hardy, for not turning down my eyes when a raven flew over my head. I never go home abruptly becau&s;e a &s;nake cro&s;&s;es my way, nor have any particular dread of a cli|macterical year; yet I confe&s;s that, with all my &s;corn of old women, and their tales, I con&s;ider it as an unhappy day when I happen to be greeted, in the morning, by Su&s;pirius the &s;creech owl.</P>
<P>I HAVE now known Su&s;pirius fifty eight years and four months, and have never yet pa&s;&s;ed an hour with him in which he has not made &s;ome attack upon my quiet. When we were fir&s;t acquainted, his great topick was the mi&s;ery of youth without riches, and when|ever we walked out together he &s;olaced me with a long enumeration of plea&s;ures, which, as they were beyond the reach of my fortune, were without the verge of my de&s;ires, and which I &s;hould never have con&s;idered as the objects of a wi&s;h, had not his un&s;ea&s;onable repre&s;entations placed them in my &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
ANOTHER of his topicks is the neglect of merit, with which he never fails to amu&s;e every man whom he &s;ees not eminently for|tunate. If he meets with a young officer, he always, informs him of gentlemen who&s;e per|&s;onal courage is unque&s;tioned, and who&s;e mi|litary &s;kill qualifies them to command armies, that have, notwith&s;tanding all their merit, grown old with &s;ubaltern commi&s;&s;ions. For a genius in the church, he is always provided with a curacy for life. The lawyer he in|forms of many men of great parts and deep &s;tudy, who have never had an opportunity to &s;peak in the courts: And meeting Serenus the phy&s;ician, "Ah doctor, &s;ays he, what a-foot &s;till, when &s;o many blockheads are rattling their chariots? I told you &s;even years ago that you would never meet with encouragement, and I hope you will now take more notice, when I tell you, that your <HI>Greek,</HI> and your diligence, and your hone&s;ty, will never enable you to live like yonder apothecary, who pre&s;cribes to his own &s;hop, and laughs at the phy&s;ician."</P>

<P>WHENEVER my evil &s;tars bring us toge|ther, he never fails to repre&s;ent to me the folly of my per&s;uits, and informs me that we are much older than when we began our acquain|tance, that the infirmities of decrepitude are coming fa&s;t upon me, that whatever I now get I &s;hall enjoy but a little time, that fame is to a man tottering on the edge of the grave of very little importance, and that the time is now at hand when I ought to look for no other plea&s;ures than a good dinner and an ea|&s;y chair.</P>

<P>ALL joy or &s;orrow for the happine&s;s or calamities of others is produced by an act of the imagination, that reali&s;es the event however fictitious, or approximates it however remote, by placing us, for a time, in the con|dition of him who&s;e fortune we contemplate; &s;o that we feel, while the deception la&s;ts' whatever motions would be excited by the &s;ame good or evil happening to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>OUR pa&s;&s;ions are therefore more &s;trongly moved, in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or plea&s;ure propo&s;ed to our minds, by recogni&s;ing them as once our own, or con&s;idering them as naturally incident to our &s;tate of life. It is not ea&s;y for the mo&s;t
<PB N="208" REF="209">
artful writer to give us an intere&s;t in happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery, which we think our&s;elves ne|ver likely to feel, and with which we have never yet been made acquainted. Hi&s;tories of the downfall of kingdoms, and revolutions of empires are read with great tranquilly; it the imperial tragedy plea&s;es common audi|tors only by its pomp of ornament, and gran|deur of ideas; and the man who&s;e faculties have been engro&s;&s;ed by bu&s;ine&s;s, and who&s;e heart never fluttered but at the ri&s;e or fall of &s;tocks, wonders how the attention can be &s;eized, or the affection agitated by a tale of love.</P>
<P>THOSE parallel circum&s;tances, and kindred images, to which we readily conform our minds, are, above all other writings, to be found in narratives of the lives of particular per&s;ons; and therefore no &s;pecies of writing &s;eems more worthy of cultivation than bio|graphy, &s;ince none can be more delightful or more u&s;eful, none can more certainly enchain the heart by irre&s;i&s;tible intere&s;t, or more wide|ly diffu&s;e in&s;truction to every diver&s;ity of con|dition.</P>
<P>THE general and rapid narratives of hi&s;to|ry,
<PB N="209" REF="210">
which involve a thou&s;and fortunes in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a day, and complicate innumerable incidents in one great tran&s;action, afford few le&s;&s;ons applicable to private life, which derives its comforts and its wretchedne&s;s from the right or wrong management of things which nothing but their frequency makes con&s;ider|able, <HI>Parva &s;i non fiant quotidie,</HI> &s;ays Pliny, and which can have no place in tho&s;e relations which never de&s;cend below the con&s;ultation of &s;enates, the motions of armies, and the &s;chemes of con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>I HAVE often thought that there has rarely pa&s;&s;ed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be u&s;eful. For, not only every man has, in the mighty ma&s;s of the world, great numbers in the &s;ame condition with him&s;elf, to whom his mi&s;takes and mi&s;|carriages, e&s;capes and expedients, would be of immediate and apparent u&s;e; but there is &s;uch an uniformity in the &s;tate of man, if it be con|&s;idered apart from adventitious and &s;eparable decorations and di&s;gui&s;es, that there is &s;carce any po&s;&s;ibility of good or ill, but is common to humankind. A great part of the time of tho&s;e who are placed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance by fortune, or by temper, mu&s;t unavoidably
<PB N="210" REF="211">
pa&s;s in the &s;ame manner; and though, when the claims of nature are &s;atisfied, caprice, and vanity, and accident, begin to produce di&s;|criminations and peculiarities, yet the eye is not very heedful, or quick, which cannot di&s;|cover the &s;ame cau&s;es &s;till terminating their influence in the &s;ame effects, though &s;ome|times accelerated, &s;ometimes retarded, or per|plexed by multiplied combinations. We are all prompted by the &s;ame motives, all deceived by the &s;ame fallacies, all animated by hope, ob&s;tructed by danger, entangled by de&s;ire, and &s;educed by plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT is frequently objected to relations of particular lives, that they are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any &s;triking or wonderful vici&s;&s;itudes. The &s;cholar who pa&s;&s;es his life among his books, the merchant who conducted only his own affairs, the prie&s;t who&s;e &s;phere of action was not extended beyond that of his duty, are con&s;idered as no proper objects of publick re|gard, however they might have excelled in their &s;everal &s;tations, whatever might have been their learning, integrity, and piety. But this notion ari&s;es from fal&s;e mea&s;ures of excel|lence and dignity, and mu&s;t be eradicated by con&s;idering, that, in the e&s;teem of uncorrupt|ed
<PB N="211" REF="212">
rea&s;on, what is of mo&s;t u&s;e is of mo&s;t va|lue.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, not improper to take hone&s;t advantages of prejudice, and to gain attenti|on by a celebrated name; but the bu&s;ine&s;s of the biographer is often to pa&s;s &s;lightly over tho&s;e performances and incidents, which pro|duce vulgar greatne&s;s, to lead the thoughts into dome&s;tick privacies, and di&s;play the mi|nute details of daily life, where exterior appen|dages are ca&s;t a&s;ide, and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue. The ac|count of Thuanus is, with great propriety, &s;aid by its author to have been written, that it might lay open to po&s;terity the private and familiar character of that man, <HI>cujus ingenium et candorem ex ip&s;ius &s;criptis &s;unt olim &s;emper miraturi,</HI> who&s;e candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings pre&s;erved in admiration.</P>
<P>THERE are many invi&s;ible circum&s;tances which, whether we read as enquiries after na|tural or moral knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our &s;cience, or increa&s;e our virtue, are more important than publick occurrences. Thus Salu&s;t, the great ma&s;ter, has not forgot,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
in his account of Catiline, to remark that <HI>his walk was now quick, and again &s;low,</HI> as indi|cations of a mind revolving &s;omething with violent commotion. Thus the &s;tory of Melanc|thon affords a &s;triking lecture on the value of time, by informing us that when he made an appointment, he expected not only the hour, but the minute to be fixed, that the day might not run out in the idlene&s;s of &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and all the plans and enterprizes of De Wit are now of le&s;s importance to the world, than that part of his per&s;onal character which repre&s;ents him as careful of his health, and negligent of his life.</P>
<P>BUT biography has often been allotted to writers who &s;eem very little acquainted with the nature of their ta&s;k, or very negligent a|bout the performance. They rarely afford a|ny other account than might be collected from publick papers, but imagine them&s;elves wri|ting a life when they exhibit a chronological &s;eries of actions or preferments, and &s;o little regard the manners or behaviour of their he|roes, that more knowledge may be gained of a man's real character, by a &s;hort conver&s;ation with one of his &s;ervants, than from a formal
<PB N="213" REF="214">
and &s;tudied narrative, begun with his pedi|gree, and ended with his funeral.</P>
<P>IF now and then they conde&s;cend to inform the world of particular facts, they are not al|ways &s;o happy as to &s;elect tho&s;e which are mo&s;t important. I know not well what advantage po&s;terity can receive from the only circum|&s;tance by which Tickell has di&s;tingui&s;hed Ad|di&s;on from the re&s;t of mankind, the irregula|rity of his pul&s;e: nor can I think my&s;elf o|verpaid for the time &s;pent in reading the life of Malherb, by being enabled to relate, after the learned biographer, that Malherb had two predominant opinions; one, that the loo&s;e|ne&s;s of a &s;ingle woman might de&s;troy all her boa&s;t of ancient de&s;cent; the other, that the French beggars made u&s;e very improperly and barbarou&s;ly of the phra&s;e <HI>noble Gentlemen,</HI> be|cau&s;e either word included the &s;en&s;e of both.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, &s;ome natural rea&s;ons why the&s;e narratives are often written by &s;uch as were not likely to give much in&s;truction or delight, and why mo&s;t accounts of particular per&s;ons are barren and u&s;ele&s;s. If a life be de|layed till intere&s;t and envy are at an end, and all motives to calumny or flattery are &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed,
<PB N="214" REF="215">
we may hope for impartiality, but mu&s;t ex|pect little intelligence; for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evane&s;cent kind, &s;uch as &s;oon e&s;cape the memory, and are rarely tran&s;mitted by traditi|on. We know how few can portray a living acquaintance, except by his mo&s;t prominent and ob&s;ervable particularities, and the gro&s;&s;er features of his mind; and it may be ea&s;ily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lo&s;t in imparting it, and how &s;oon a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of copies will lo&s;e all re&s;emblance of the original.</P>
<P>IF the biographer writes from per&s;onal knowledge, and makes ha&s;te to gratify the publick curio&s;ity, there is danger le&s;t his in|tere&s;t, his fear, his gratitude, or his tender|ne&s;s, overpower his fidelity, and tempt him to conceal, if not to invent. There are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or &s;ailings of their friends, even when they can no longer &s;uffer by their detection; we therefore &s;ee whole ranks of characters adorn|ed with uniform panegyrick, and not to be known from one another, but by extrin&s;ick and ca&s;ual circum&s;tances. "Let me remem|ber, &s;ays Hale, when I find my&s;elf incli|ned
<PB N="215" REF="216">
to pity a criminal, that there is like|wi&s;e a pity due to the country." If there is a regard due to the memory of the dead, there is yet more re&s;pect to be paid to know|ledge, to virtue, and to truth.</P>

<P>IT is extremely vexatious to a man of eager and thir&s;ty curio&s;ity to be placed at a great di&s;tance from the fountain of intelligence, and not only never to receive the current of report till it has &s;atiated the greate&s;t part of the nation, but at la&s;t to find it mudded in its cour&s;e, and corrupted with &s;ome taints or mixtures from every channel through which it &s;lowed.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief plea&s;ures of my life is to hear what pa&s;&s;es in the world, to know what
<PB N="216" REF="217">
are the &s;chemes of the politick, the aims of the bu&s;y, and the hopes of the ambitious; what changes of publick mea&s;ures are ap|proaching; who is likely to be cru&s;hed in the colli&s;ion of parties; who is climbing to the top of power, and who is tottering on the preci|pice of di&s;grace. But as it is very common for us to de&s;ire mo&s;t what we are lea&s;t qualifi|ed to obtain, I have &s;uffered this appetite of news to outgrow all the gratifications which my pre&s;ent &s;ituation can afford it; for being placed in a remote country, I am condemned always to confound the future with the pa&s;t, to form progno&s;tications of events no longer doubtful, and to con&s;ider the expediency of &s;chemes already executed or defeated. I am perplexed with a perpetual deception in my pro&s;pects, like a man pointing his tele&s;cope at a remote &s;tar, which before the light reaches his eye has for&s;aken the place from which it was emitted.</P>
<P>THE mortification of being thus always be|hind the active world in my reflexions and di&s;|coveries, is exceedingly aggravated by the pe|tulance of tho&s;e who&s;e health, or bu&s;ine&s;s, or plea&s;ure brings them hither from London.
<PB N="217" REF="218">
For, without con&s;idering the in&s;uperable di&s;|advantages of my condition, and the unavoid|able ignorance which ab&s;ence mu&s;t produce, they often treat me with the utmo&s;t &s;upercili|ou&s;ne&s;s of contempt, for not knowing what no human &s;agacity can di&s;cover; and &s;ome|times &s;eem to con&s;ider me as a wretch &s;carce|ly worthy of human conver&s;e, when I happen to talk of the fortune of a bankrupt, or pro|po&s;e the healths of the dead, when I warn them of mi&s;chiefs already incurred, or wi&s;h for mea&s;ures that have been lately taken. They &s;eem to attribute to the &s;uperiority of their intellects what they only owe to the ac|cident of their condition, and think them|&s;elves indi&s;putably entitled to airs of in&s;olence and authority, when they find another igno|rant of facts, which becau&s;e they echoed in the &s;treets of London, they &s;uppo&s;e equally publick in all other places, and known where they could neither be &s;een, related, nor con|jectured.</P>
<P>TO this haughtine&s;s they are, indeed, too much encouraged by the re&s;pect which they receive among&s;t us, for no other rea&s;on than that they come from London. For no &s;ooner is the arrival of one of the&s;e di&s;&s;eminators of
<PB N="218" REF="219">
knowledge known in the country, than we croud about him from every quarter, and by innumerable enquiries flatter him into an opi|nion of his own importance. He &s;ees him|&s;elf &s;urrounded by multitudes, who propo&s;e their doubts, and refer their controver&s;ies to him, as to a being de&s;cended from &s;ome nobler region, and he grows on a &s;udden oraculous and infallible, &s;olves all difficulties, and &s;ets all objections at defiance.</P>
<P>THERE is, in my opinion, great rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pecting, that they &s;ometimes take advan|tage of this reverential mode&s;ty, and impo&s;e upon ru&s;tick under&s;tandings with a fal&s;e &s;how of univer&s;al intelligence; for I do not find that they are willing to own them&s;elves igno|rant of any thing, or that they di&s;mi&s;s any enquirer with a po&s;itive and deci&s;ive an&s;wer. The court, the city, the park, and exchange, are to tho&s;e men of unbounded ob&s;ervation equally familiar, and they are alike ready to tell the hour at which &s;tocks will ri&s;e, or the mini&s;try be changed.</P>
<P>A SHORT re&s;idence at London entitles a man to knowledge, to wit, to politene&s;s, and to a de&s;potick and dictatorial power of pre|&s;cribing
<PB N="219" REF="220">
to the rude multitude, whom he con|de&s;cends to honour with a biennial vi&s;it; yet, I know not well upon what motives I have lately found my&s;elf inclined to cavil at this pre&s;cription, and to doubt whether it be not, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, proper to withold our ve|neration, till we are more authentically con|vinced of the merits of the claimant.</P>
<P>IT is well remember'd here, that, about &s;even years ago, one Frolick, a tall boy, with lank hair, remarkable for &s;tealing eggs, and &s;ucking them, was taken from the &s;chool in this pari&s;h, and &s;ent up to London to &s;tudy the law. As he had given among&s;t us no proofs of a genius, de&s;igned by nature for extraor|dinary performances, he was, from the time of his departure totally forgotten, nor was there any talk of his vices or virtues, his good or his ill fortune, till la&s;t &s;ummer a report bur&s;t upon us, that Mr Frolick was come down in the fir&s;t po&s;t-chai&s;e which this village had &s;een, having travelled with &s;uch rapidity that one of his po&s;tilions had broke his leg, and another narrowly e&s;caped &s;uffocation in a quick&s;and. But that Mr Frolick &s;eemed totally unconcerned, for &s;uch things were ne|ver heeded at London.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
Mr FROLICK next day appeared among the gentlemen at their weekly meeting on the bowling-green, and now were &s;een the effects of a London education. His dre&s;s, his lan|guage, his ideas, were all new, and he did not much endeavour to conceal his contempt of every thing that differed from the opinions, or practice, of the modi&s;h world. He &s;hew|ed us the deformity of our &s;kirts and &s;leeves, informed us where hats of the proper &s;ize were to be &s;old, and recommended to us the reformation of a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities in our cloaths, our cookery, and our conver&s;ation. When any of his phra&s;es were unintelligible, he could not &s;uppre&s;s the joy of confe&s;&s;ed &s;u|periority, but frequently delayed the explana|tion that he might enjoy his triumph over our barbarity.</P>
<P>WHEN he is plea&s;ed to entertain us with a &s;tory, he takes care to croud into it names of &s;treets, &s;quares and buildings, with which he knows we are unacquainted. The favourite topicks of his di&s;cour&s;e are the pranks of runkards, and the tricks put upon country gentlemen by porters and link-boys. When he is with ladies he tells them of the innumer|able
<PB N="221" REF="222">
plea&s;ures to which he can introduce them; but never fails to hint, how much they will be deficient, at their fir&s;t arrival, in the know|ledge of the town. What it is <HI>to know the town</HI> he has not indeed hitherto informed us, tho' there is no phra&s;e &s;o frequent in his mouth, nor any &s;cience which he appears to think of &s;o great value, or &s;o difficult attainment.</P>
<P>BUT my curio&s;ity has been mo&s;t engaged by the recital of his own adventures and atchieve|ments. I have heard of the union of various characters in &s;ingle per&s;ons, but never met with &s;uch a con&s;tellation of great qualities as this man's narrative affords. Whatever has di&s;tingui&s;hed the hero; whatever has elevated the wit; whatever has indeared the lover, are all concentered in Mr Frolick, who&s;e life has, for &s;even years, been a regular inter|change of intrigues, dangers, and waggeries, and who has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in every cha|racter that can be feared, envied, or admired.</P>
<P>I QUESTION whether all the officers of the royal navy can bring together, from all their journals, a collection of &s;o many wonderful e&s;capes as this man has known upon the Thames, on which he has been a thou&s;and
<PB N="222" REF="223">
and a thou&s;and times on the point of peri&s;hing, &s;ometimes by the terrors of fooli&s;h women in the &s;ame boat, &s;ometimes by his own ac|knowledged imprudence in pa&s;&s;ing the river in the dark, and &s;ometimes by &s;hooting the bridge, under which he has rencountered mountainous waves, and dreadful cataracts.</P>
<P>NOR le&s;s has been his temerity by land, nor fewer his hazards. He has reeled with giddi|ne&s;s on the top of the monument; he has cro&s;|&s;ed the &s;treet amid&s;t the ru&s;h of coaches; he has been &s;urrounded by robbers with out num|ber; he has headed parties at the play-hou&s;e, he has &s;caled the windows of every toa&s;t of whatever condition; he has been hunted for whole winters by his rivals; he has &s;lept upon bulk,, he has cut chairs, he has bilked coach|men; he has re&s;cued his friends from the bai|liffs, has knocked down the con&s;table, has bul|lied the ju&s;tice, and performed many other exploits, that have filled the town with won|der and with merriment.</P>
<P>BUT yet greater is the fame of his under|&s;tanding than his bravery; for he informs us, that he is, at London, the e&s;tabli&s;hed arbitra|tor of all points of honour, and the deci&s;ive
<PB N="223" REF="224">
judge of all performance of genius; that no mu&s;ical performer is in reputation till the opi|nion of Frolick has ratified his preten&s;ions; that the theatres &s;u&s;pend their &s;entence till he begins the clap or hi&s;s, in which all are proud to concur; that no publick entertainment has failed or &s;ucceeded, but becau&s;e he oppo&s;ed or favoured it; that all controver&s;ies at the gam|ing-table are referred to his determination; that he adju&s;ts the ceremonial at every a&s;&s;em|bly, and pre&s;cribes every fa&s;hion of plea&s;ure or of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH every man who&s;e name occurs in the papers of the day, he is intimately ac|quainted; and there are very few po&s;ts, either in the &s;tate or army, of which he has not more or le&s;s influenced the di&s;po&s;al. He has been very frequently con&s;ulted both upon war and peace; but the time is not yet come when the nation &s;hall know how much it is indebted to the genius of Frolick.</P>
<P>YET, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e declarati|ons, I cannot hitherto per&s;uade my&s;elf to &s;ee that Mr Frolick has more wit, or knowledge, or courage, than the re&s;t of mankind, or that any uncommon enlargement of his faculties
<PB N="224" REF="225">
has happened in the time of his ab&s;ence. For when he talks on &s;ubjects known to the re&s;t of the company, he has no advantage over us, but by catches of interruption, bri&s;kne&s;s of interrogation, and pertne&s;s of contempt; and therefore if he has &s;tunned the world with his name, and gained a place in the fir&s;t ranks of humanity, I cannot but conclude, that ei|ther a little under&s;tanding confers eminence at London, or that Mr Frolick thinks us un|worthy of the exertion of his powers, or that his faculties are benumbed by rural &s;tupidity, as the magnetick needle lo&s;es its animation in the polar climes.</P>
<P>I WOULD not, however, like many ha&s;ty philo&s;ophers, &s;earch after the cau&s;e till I am certain of the effect; and, therefore, I de&s;ire to be informed, whether you have yet heard the great name of Mr Frolick. If he is cele|brated by other tongues than his own, I &s;hall willingly propagate his prai&s;e; but if he has &s;welled among us with empty boa&s;ts, and honours conferred only by him&s;elf, I &s;hall treat him with ru&s;tick &s;incerity, and drive him as an impo&s;tor from this part of the kingdom to &s;ome region of more credulity.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a young woman of a very large for|tune, which, if my parents would have been per&s;uaded to comply with the rules and cu&s;toms of the polite part of mankind, might long &s;ince have rai&s;ed me to the highe&s;t ho|nours of the female world; but &s;o &s;trangely have they hitherto contrived to wa&s;te my life, that I am now on the borders of twenty, without having ever danced but at our month|ly a&s;&s;embly, or been toa&s;ted but among a few gentlemen of the neighbourhood, or &s;een any company in which it was worth a wi&s;h to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227">
MY father having impaired his patrimony in &s;oliciting a place at court, at la&s;t grew wi&s;e enough to cea&s;e his per&s;uit, and, to re|pair the con&s;equences of expen&s;ive attendance and negligence of his affairs, married a lady much older than him&s;elf, who had lived in the fa&s;hionable world till &s;he was con&s;idered as an encumbrance upon parties of plea&s;ure, and, as I can collect from incidental informa|tions, retired from gay a&s;&s;emblies ju&s;t time enough to e&s;cape the mortification of univer|&s;al neglect.</P>
<P>SHE was, however, &s;till rich, and not yet wrinkled; my father was too di&s;tresfully em|barra&s;&s;ed by the difficulty of his circum&s;tances to think much on any thing but the means of extrication, and though it is not likely that he wanted the delicacy which polite conver&s;ation will always produce in under&s;tandings not re|markably defective, yet he was contented with a match, by which he might be &s;et free from inconveniencies, that would have de&s;troyed all the plea&s;ures of imagination, and taken from &s;oftne&s;s and beauty the power of delighting.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228">
AS they were both &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ted with their treatment in the world, and mar|ried, though without any di&s;like of each o|ther, yet principally for the &s;ake of &s;etting them&s;elves free from dependance on caprice or fa&s;hion, they &s;oon retired into the country, and devoted their lives to rural bu&s;ine&s;s and diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>THEY had, indeed, not much rea&s;on to regret the change of their &s;ituation; for their vanity, which had &s;o long been tormented by neglect and di&s;appointment, was here gratifi|ed with every honour that could with proprie|ty be paid them. Their long familiarity with publick life made them the oracles of all tho&s;e who a&s;pired to intelligence, or politene&s;s. My father dictated politicks, my mother pre|&s;cribed the mode, and it was &s;ufficient to enti|tle any family to &s;ome con&s;ideration, that they were known to vi&s;it at Mrs Courtly's.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate they were, to &s;peak in the &s;tyle of novelli&s;ts, made happy by the &s;tile of novel|li&s;ts, made happy by the birth of your corre|&s;pondent. My parents had no other child, I was therefore not brow-beaten by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">cy bro|ther, or lo&s;t in a multitude of coheire&s;&s;es,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
who&s;e fortunes being equal would probably have conferred equal merit, and procured equal regard; and as my mother was now too old to dread a rival in her daughter, my under|&s;tanding, and my per&s;on, had fair play, my enquiries were not check'd, my advances to|wards importance were not repre&s;&s;ed, and I was &s;oon &s;uffered to tell my own opinions, and early accu&s;tomed to hear my own prai&s;es.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e accidental advantages I was &s;o much exalted above the young ladies with whom I conver&s;ed, and was treated by them with &s;o much deference, that I had all the gratifi|cations which pride can demand. I &s;aw none who did not &s;eem to confe&s;s my &s;uperiority, and to be held in awe by the &s;plendour of my appearance; for the fondne&s;s of my father made him&s;elf plea&s;ed to &s;ee me dre&s;&s;ed, and my mother had no vanity nor expences to hin|der her from concurring with his inclinations.</P>
<P>THUS, Mr Rambler, I lived without much de&s;ire after any thing beyond the circle of our vi&s;its; and here I &s;hould have quietly continu|ed to portion out my time among my books, and my needle, and my company, had not my curio&s;ity been every moment excited by
<PB N="229" REF="230">
the conver&s;ation of my parents, who whenever they &s;it down to familiar prattle, and endea|vour the entertainment of each other, imme|diately tran&s;port them&s;elves to London, and relate &s;ome adventure in a hackney coach, &s;ome frolick at a ma&s;querade, &s;ome conver&s;ati|on in the park, or &s;ome quarrel at an a&s;&s;em|bly, di&s;play the magnificence of a birth-night, relate the conque&s;ts of maids of honour, or give a hi&s;tory of diver&s;ions, &s;hows, and enter|tainments, which I had never known but from their accounts.</P>
<P>I AM &s;o well ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of the gay world, that I can relate, with great punctu|ality, the lives of all the la&s;t race of wits and beauties; can enumerate, with exact chrono|logy, the whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of celebrated &s;ing|ers, mu&s;icians, tragedians, comedians, and harlequins; can tell to the la&s;t twenty years all the changes of fa&s;hions; and am, indeed, a complete antiquary with re&s;pect to hea-ddre&s;|&s;es, dances, and operas.</P>
<P>YOU will ea&s;ily imagine, Mr Rambler, that I could not hear the&s;e narratives, for &s;ixteen years together, without &s;uffering &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ion, and wi&s;hing my&s;elf nearer to tho&s;e &s;cenes
<PB N="230" REF="231">
of perpetual novelty, to places where every hour brings &s;ome new plea&s;ure, and life is diver&s;ified with an unexhau&s;ted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of felicity.</P>
<P>I INDEED often a&s;ked my mother why &s;he left a place which &s;he recollected with &s;o much delight, and why &s;he did not vi&s;it Lon|don once a year, like &s;ome other ladies, and initiate me in the world by &s;howing me it amu&s;ements, its grandeur, and its variety. But &s;he always told me that the days which &s;he had &s;een were &s;uch as will never come again, that all diver&s;ion is now degenerated, that the conver&s;ation of the pre&s;ent age is in|&s;ipid, that their fa&s;hions are unbecoming, their cu&s;toms ab&s;urd, and their morals corrupt; that there is no ray left of the genius which enlightened the times that &s;he remembers; that no one who had &s;een, or heard, the ancient performers, would be able to bear the bunglers of this de&s;picable age, and that there is now neither politene&s;s, nor plea|&s;ure, nor virtue, in the world. She therefore a&s;&s;ures me that &s;he con&s;ults my happine&s;s by keeping me at home, for I &s;hould now find nothing but vexation and di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;he
<PB N="231" REF="232">
&s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;ee me plea&s;ed with &s;uch fopperies and trifles, as take up the thoughts of the pre&s;ent &s;et of young people.</P>
<P>WITH this an&s;wer I was kept quiet for &s;everal years, and thought it no great incon|venience to be confined to the country, till la&s;t &s;ummer a young gentleman and his &s;i&s;ter came down to pa&s;s a few months with one of our neighbours. They had generally no great re|gard for the country ladies, but di&s;tingui&s;hed me by particular complai&s;ance, and, as we grew intimate, gave me &s;uch a detail of the elegance, the &s;plendour, the mirth, the hap|pine&s;s of the town, that I am re&s;olved to be no longer buried in ignorance and ob&s;curity, but to &s;hare with other wits the joy of being admired, and divide with other beauties the empire of the world.</P>
<P>I DO not find, Mr Rambler, upon a delibe|rate and impartial compari&s;on, that I am excel|led by Belinda in beauty, in wit, in judge|ment, in knowledge, or in any thing, but a kind of gay, lively familiarity, by which &s;he mingles with &s;trangers as with per&s;ons long acquainted, and which enables her to di&s;play her powers without any ob&s;truction, he&s;itati|on,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
or confu&s;ion. Yet &s;he can relate a thou|&s;and civilities paid to her in publick, can pro|duce, from a hundred lovers, letters filled with prai&s;es, prote&s;tations, exta&s;ies and de|&s;pair; has been handed by dukes to her chair; has been the occa&s;ion of innumerable quarrels; has paid twenty vi&s;its in an afternoon; been invited to &s;ixballs in an evening, and been for|ced to retire to lodgings in the country from the importunity of court&s;hip, and the fatigue of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I TELL you, Mr Rambler, I will &s;tay here no longer. I have at la&s;t prevailed upon my mother to &s;end me to town, and &s;hall &s;et out in three weeks on the grand expedition. I in|tend to live in publick, and to croud into the winter every plea&s;ure which money can pur|cha&s;e, and every honour which beauty can obtain.</P>
<P>BUT this tedious interval how &s;hall I en|dure? Cannot you alleviate the mi&s;ery of delay by &s;ome plea&s;ing de&s;cription of the entertain|ments of the town? I can read, I can talk, I can think of nothing el&s;e; and if you will not &s;ooth my impatience, heighten my ideas, and animate my hopes, you may write for tho&s;e
<PB N="233" REF="234">
who have more lei&s;ure, but are not to expect any longer the honour of being read by tho&s;e eyes which are now intent only on conque&s;t and de&s;truction.</P>

<P>IT has been remarked, perhaps, by every writer, who has le&s;t behind him ob&s;erva|tions upon life, that no man is plea&s;ed with his pre&s;ent &s;tate, which proves equally un&s;ati&s;|factory, &s;ays Horace, whether fallen upon by chance, or cho&s;en with deliberation; we are always di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;ome circum&s;tance or other of our &s;ituation, and imagine the condition of others more abundant in ble&s;&s;ings, or le&s;s expo&s;ed to calamities.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
THIS univer&s;al di&s;content has been generally mentioned with great &s;everity of cen&s;ure, as unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf, &s;ince of two, equally envious of each other, both cannot have the larger &s;hare of happine&s;s, and as tending to darken life with unnatural and unnece&s;&s;ary gloom, by withdrawing our minds from the contemplation and enjoyment of that happi|ne&s;s which our &s;tate affords us, and fixing our attention upon foreign objects, which we only behold to depre&s;s our&s;elves, and in|crea&s;e our mi&s;ery by injurious compari&s;ons.</P>
<P>WHEN this opinion of the happine&s;s of others predominates in the heart, &s;o as to ex|cite re&s;olutions of obtaining, at whatever price, the condition to which &s;uch tran&s;cendent pri|vileges are &s;uppo&s;ed to be annexed; when it bur&s;ts into action and produces fraud, violence, and inju&s;tice, it is, without doubt, to be per&s;ued wiih all the rigour of legal puni&s;h|ments. But while it only operates upon the thoughts, and di&s;turbs none but him who has happened to admit it, and, however it may interrupt content, makes no attack on piety or virtue, I cannot think it &s;o far criminal
<PB N="235" REF="236">
or ridiculous, but that it may de&s;erve &s;ome pity, and admit &s;ome excu&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT all are equally happy, or mi&s;erable I &s;uppo&s;e none is &s;ufficiently enthu&s;ia&s;tical to maintain; becau&s;e, though, as it has been often objected, we cannot judge of the con|dition of others, yet every man has found frequent vici&s;&s;itudes in his own &s;tate, and mu&s;t therefore be convinced that life is &s;u&s;ceptible of more or le&s;s felicity. What then &s;hall forbid us to endeavour the alteration of that which we find capable of being improved, and to gra&s;p at augmentations of good, when we know it po&s;&s;ible to be increa&s;ed, and believe that any particular change of &s;ituation will increa&s;e it?</P>
<P>IF he that finds him&s;elf unea&s;y may rea|&s;onably make efforts to rid him&s;elf from vex|ation, all mankind have a &s;ufficient plea for &s;ome degree of re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, and the fault &s;eems to be little more than too much temerity of conclu&s;ion, in favour of &s;omething not yet experienced, and too much readine&s;s to believe' that the mi&s;ery which our own pa&s;&s;ions and appetites produce, is brought upon us by ac|cidental cau&s;es, and external efficients.</P>

IT is, indeed, frequently di&s;covered by us, that we have complained too ha&s;tily of peculiar hard&s;hips, and have imagined our&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hed by embarra&s;&s;ments, with which other cla&s;&s;es of men are equally entangled. We often change a lighter for a greater evil, and wi&s;h our&s;elves re&s;tored again to the &s;tate from which we thought it de&s;irable to be delivered. But this knowledge, though it is ea&s;ily gained by the trial, is not always attainable any other way, and that error cannot ju&s;tly be reproach|ed, which rea&s;on could not obviate, nor prudence avoid.</P>
<P>TO take a view at once di&s;tinct and com|prehen&s;ive of human life, with all its intricacies of combination, and varieties of connexion, is beyond the power of mortal intelligences. Of the &s;tate with which practice has not ac|quainted us, we &s;natch a glimp&s;e, we di&s;cern a point, and regulate the re&s;t by pa&s;&s;ion, and by fancy. In this enquiry every favourite prejudice, every innate de&s;ire, is bu&s;y to deceive us. We are unhappy, at lea&s;t le&s;s happy than our nature &s;eems to admit; we nece&s;&s;arily de&s;ire the melioration of our lot; what we de&s;ire, we very rea&s;onably &s;eek, and
<PB N="237" REF="238">
what we &s;eeck we are naturally eager to believe that we have &s;ound. Our confidence is, in|deed, often di&s;appointed, but our rea&s;on is not convinced, and there is no man who does not hope for &s;omething which he has not, though, perhaps his wi&s;hes lie unactive, be|cau&s;e he fore&s;ees the difficulty of attainment. As among the numerous &s;tudents of Hermetick philo&s;ophy, not one appears to have de&s;i&s;ted from the ta&s;k of tran&s;mutation, from convic|tion of its impo&s;&s;ibility, but from wearine&s;s of toil, or impatience of delay, a broken body, or exhau&s;ted fortune.</P>
<P>IRRESOLUTION and mutability are often the faults of men, who&s;e views are wide, and who&s;e imagination is vigorous and excur&s;ive, becau&s;e they cannot confine their thoughts within their own boundaries of action, but are continually ranging over all the &s;eenes of human exi&s;tence, and, con&s;equently, are often apt to conceive that they fall upon new regions of plea&s;ure, and &s;tart new po&s;&s;ibilities of hap|pine&s;s. Thus they are too often bu&s;ied with a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;chemes, and pa&s;s their lives in alternate elation and &s;orrow, for want of that calm and immovable acquie&s;cence in their condition, by which men of flower

under&s;tandings are fixed for ever to a certain point, or led on in the plain beaten track, which their fathers, and grand&s;ires, have trod before them.</P>
<P>OF two conditions of life equally inviting to the pro&s;pect, that will always have the di&s;|advantage which we have already tried; be|cau&s;e the evils which we have felt we cannot extenuate; and though we have, perhaps from nature, the power as well of aggravating the calamity which we fear, as of heightening the ble&s;&s;ing we expect, yet in tho&s;e meditations which we indulge by choice, and which are not forced upon the mind by nece&s;&s;ity, we have always the art of fixing our regard upon the more plea&s;ing images, and &s;uffer hope to di&s;po&s;e the lights by which we look upon fu|turity.</P>
<P>THE good and ill of different modes of life are &s;ometimes &s;o equally oppo&s;ed, that, per|haps no man ever yet made his choice between them upon a full conviction, and adequate knowledge; and therefore fluctuation of will is not more wonderful, when they are propo|&s;ed to the election, than o&s;cillations of a beam charged with equal weights. The mind no
<PB N="239" REF="240">
&s;ooner imagines it&s;elf determined by &s;ome pre|valent advantage, than &s;ome convenience of equal weight is di&s;covered on the other &s;ide, and the re&s;olutions which are &s;ugge&s;ted by the nice&s;t examination, are often repented as &s;oon as they are taken.</P>
<P>EUMENES, a young man of great abilities, inherited a very large e&s;tate from a father, who had been long eminent in the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous employments. His father, harra&s;&s;ed with frequent competitions, and perplexed with multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, very earne&s;tly re|commended to him the quiet and &s;ecurity of a private &s;tation, and impre&s;&s;ed his per&s;ua&s;ions with &s;o much force, that Eumenes for &s;ome years re&s;i&s;ted every motion of ambitious wi&s;hes; but being once provoked by the &s;ight of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, which he could not redre&s;s, he began to think it the duty of an hone&s;t man to enable him&s;elf to protect others, and gradually felt a de&s;ire of greatne&s;s, ex|cited by a thou&s;and projects of advantage to his country. His fortune immediately placed him in the &s;enate, his knowledge and eloquence &s;oon advanced him at court, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that authority and influence which he had re|&s;olved to exert for the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="241">
HE now became acquainted with the em|barra&s;&s;ments of greatne&s;s, and was in a &s;hort time convinced, that in proportion as the power of doing well was enlarged, the temp|tations to do ill were multiplied and enforced. He felt him&s;elf every moment in danger of being either &s;educed or driven from his hone&s;t purpo&s;es. Sometimes a friend was to be gratified, and &s;ometimes a rival to be cru&s;hed, by means which his con&s;cience could not ap|prove. Sometimes he was forced to comply with the prejudices of the publick, and &s;ome|times with the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try. He was by degrees wearied with perpetual &s;trug|gles to unite policy and virtue, and went back to retirement as the &s;helter of innocence, per|&s;uaded that he could only hope to benefit mankind by a blamele&s;s example of private virtue. Here he &s;pent &s;ome years in tran|quillity and beneficence; but finding that corruption increa&s;ed, and fal&s;e opinions in government prevailed, he thought him&s;elf again &s;ummoned to po&s;ts of publick tru&s;t, from which new evidence of his own weak|ne&s;s again determined him to retire.</P>
<P>THUS men may be made incon&s;tant by

virtue and by vice, by too much or too little thought; yet incon&s;tancy, however dignified by its motives, is always to be avoided, be|cau&s;e life allows us but a &s;mall time for en|quiry and experiment, and he that &s;teadily en|deavours at excellence, in whatever employ|ment, will more benefit mankind than he that he&s;itates in choo&s;ing his part till he is called to the performance.

<P>WHEN Socrates was building him&s;elf a hou&s;e at Athens, being a&s;ked by one that ob&s;erved the littlene&s;s of the de&s;ign, why a man &s;o eminent would not have an abode more &s;uitable to his dignity? he replied, that he &s;hould think him&s;elf &s;ufficiently accommo|dated,
<PB N="428" REF="243">
if he could &s;ee that narrow habitation filled with real friends. Such was the opinion of this great ma&s;ter of human life, concern|ing the infrequency of &s;uch an union of minds as might de&s;erve the name of friend|&s;hip, that, among the multitudes whom vani|ty or curio&s;ity, civility or veneration, crouded about him, he did not expect, that very &s;pa|cious apartments would be nece&s;&s;ary to contain all that &s;hould regard him with &s;incere kind|ne&s;s, or adhere to him with &s;teady fidelity.</P>
<P>SO many qualities are indeed requi&s;ite to the po&s;&s;ibility of friend&s;hip, and &s;o many accidents mu&s;t concur to its ri&s;e and its continuance, that no wonder can be excited by ob&s;erving, that the greate&s;t part of mankind content them&s;elves without it, and &s;upply its place as they can, with intere&s;t and dependance.</P>
<P>MULTITUDES are unqualified for a con|&s;tant and warm reciprocation of benevolence, as they are incapacitated for any other elevated excellence, by a perpetual attention to their intere&s;t, and an unre&s;i&s;ting &s;ubjection to their pa&s;&s;ions. An inability may be &s;uperinduced by long habits of denying any de&s;ire, or of re|pre&s;&s;ing, by &s;uperior motives, the importuni|ties
<PB N="243" REF="244">
of any immediate gratification, and an inveterate &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will imagine all advanta|ges dimini&s;hed in proportion as they are com|municated.</P>
<P>BUT not only this hateful and confirmed corruption, but many varieties of di&s;po&s;ition, not incon&s;i&s;tent with common degrees of vir|tue, may exclude friend&s;hip from the heart. Some ardent enough in their benevolence, and defective neither in officiou&s;ne&s;s, nor li|berality, are mutable and uncertain, &s;oon at|tracted by new objects, di&s;gu&s;ted without of|fence, and alienated without enmity. Others are &s;oft and flexible, ea&s;ily influenced by re|ports or whi&s;pers, ready to catch alarms from every dubious circum&s;tance, and to li&s;ten to every &s;u&s;picion which envy and flattery &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, to follow the opinion of every con|fident advi&s;er, and move by the impul&s;e of the la&s;t breath. Some are impatient of con|tradiction, more willing to go wrong by their own judgment, than to be indebted for a better or a &s;afer way to the &s;agacity of another, inclined to con&s;ider coun&s;el as in&s;ult, and en|quiry as want of confidence, and to confer their regard on no other terms than unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and implicit compliance. Some
<PB N="244" REF="245">
are dark and involved, equally careful to con|ceal good and bad purpo&s;es, and plea&s;ed with producing effects by invi&s;ible means, and &s;hew|ing their de&s;ign only in its execution. Others are univer&s;ally communicative, alike open to every eye, and equally profu&s;e of their own &s;ecrets and tho&s;e of others, without the nece&s;|&s;ary vigilance of caution, or the hone&s;t arts of prudent integrity; ready to accu&s;e without malice, and to betray without treachery. Any of the&s;e may be u&s;eful to the community, and pa&s;s through the world with the reputati|on of good purpo&s;es and uncorrupted morals, but they are unfit for clo&s;e and tender intima|cies. He cannot properly be cho&s;en for a friend, who&s;e kindne&s;s is exhaled by its own warmth, or frozen by the fir&s;t bla&s;t of &s;lan|der; he cannot be a u&s;eful coun&s;ellor, who will hear no opinion but his own; he will not much invite confidence who&s;e principal max|im is to &s;u&s;pect; nor can the candour and frankne&s;s of that man be much e&s;teemed, who &s;preads his arms to human kind, and makes every man, without di&s;tinction, a denizon of his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>THAT friend&s;hip may be at once fond and la&s;ting, there mu&s;t not only be equal virtue on
<PB N="245" REF="246">
each part, but virtue of the &s;ame kind; not only the &s;ame end mu&s;t be propo&s;ed, but the &s;ame means mu&s;t be approved by both. We are often, by &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments and accidental endearments, induced to love tho&s;e whom we cannot e&s;teem; we are &s;ometimes, by great abilities and inconte&s;table evidences of virtue, compelled to e&s;teem tho&s;e whom we cannot love. But friend&s;hip, compounded of e&s;teem and love, derives from one its ten|derne&s;s and its permanence from the other; and therefore requires not only that its candi|didates &s;hould gain the judgment, but that they &s;hould attract the affections; that they &s;hould not only be firm in the day of di&s;tre&s;s, but gay in the hour of jollity; not only u&s;eful in exigences, but plea&s;ing in familiar life; their pre&s;ence &s;hould give chearfulne&s;s as well as courage, and di&s;pel alike the gloom of fear and of melancholy.</P>
<P>TO this mutual complacency is generally re|qui&s;ite an uniformity of opinions, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e active and con&s;picuous principles which di&s;criminate parties in government, and &s;ects in religion, and which every day operate more or le&s;s on the common bu&s;ine&s;s of life. For though great tenderne&s;s has, perhaps, been
<PB N="246" REF="247">
&s;ometimes known to continue between men eminent in contrary factions; yet &s;uch friends are to be &s;hewn rather as prodigies than exam|ples, and it is no more proper to regulate our conduct by &s;uch in&s;tances, than to leap a precipice, becau&s;e &s;ome have fallen from it and e&s;caped with life.</P>
<P>IT cannot but be extremely difficult to pre|&s;erve private kindne&s;s in the mid&s;t of publick oppo&s;ition, in which will nece&s;&s;arily be in|volved a thou&s;and incidents, extending their influence to conver&s;ation and privacy. Men engaged, by moral or religious motives, in contrary parties, will generally look with dif|ferent eyes upon every man, and decide almo&s;t every que&s;tion upon different principles. When &s;uch occa&s;ions of di&s;pute happen, to comply is to betray our cau&s;e, and to maintain friend&s;hip by cea&s;ing to de&s;erve it; to be &s;ilent, is to lo&s;e the happine&s;s and dignity of inde|pendence, to live in perpetual con&s;traint, and to de&s;ert, if not to betray: and who &s;hall de|termine which of two friends &s;hall yield, where neither believes him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and both confe&s;s the importance of the que&s;tion? What then remains but contradiction and de|bate?
<PB N="247" REF="248">
and from tho&s;e what can be expected, but acrimony and vehemence, the in&s;olence of triumph, the vexation of defeat, and, in time, a wearine&s;s of conte&s;t, and an extincti|on of benevolence? Exchange of endearments and intercour&s;e of civility may continue, in|deed, as boughs may for a while be verdant, when the root is wounded; but the poi&s;on of di&s;cord is infu&s;ed, and though the counte|nance may pre&s;erve its &s;mile, the heart is har|dening and contracting.</P>
<P>THAT man will not be long agreeable, whom we &s;ee only in times of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;everity; and therefore, to maintain the &s;oft|ne&s;s and &s;erenity of benevolence, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that friends partake each others plea&s;ures as well as cares, and be led to the &s;ame diver|&s;ions by &s;imilitude of ta&s;te. This is, howe|ver, not to be con&s;idered as equally indi&s;pen|&s;able with conformity of principles, becau&s;e any man may hone&s;tly, according to the pre|cepts of Horace, re&s;ign the gratifications of ta&s;te to the humour of another, and friend&s;hip may well de&s;erve the &s;acrifice of plea&s;ure, though not of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>IT was once ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed to me,
<PB N="248" REF="249">
by a painter, that no profe&s;&s;or of his art ever loved another. This declaration is &s;o far ju&s;ti|fied by the knowledge of life, as to damp the hopes of warm and con&s;tant friend&s;hip, be|tween men whom their &s;tudies have made competitors, and whom every favourer and every cen&s;urer are hourly inciting again&s;t each other. The utmo&s;t expectation that experi|ence can warrant, is, that they &s;hould forbear open ho&s;tilities and &s;ecret machinations, and when the whole fraternity is attacked, be able to unite again&s;t a common &s;oe. Some how|ever, though few, may perhaps be found, in whom emulation has not been able to over|power genero&s;ity, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed from lower beings by nobler motives than the love of fame, and can pre&s;erve the &s;acred flame of friend&s;hip from the gu&s;ts of pride, and the rubbi&s;h of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>FRIENDSHIP is &s;eldom la&s;ting but between equals, or where the &s;uperiority on one &s;ide is reduced by &s;ome equivalent advantage on the other. Benefits which cannot be repaid, and obligations which cannot be di&s;charged, are not commonly &s;ound to increa&s;e affection; they excite gratitude indeed, and heighten vencrati|on,
<PB N="249" REF="250">
but commonly take away that ea&s;y free|dom, and familiarity of intercour&s;e, without which, though there may be fidelity, and zeal, and admiration, there cannot be friend&s;hip. Thus imperfect are all earthly ble&s;&s;ings; the great effect of friend&s;hip is beneficence, yet by the fir&s;t act of uncommon kindne&s;s it is en|dangered, like plants that bear their fruit and die. Yet this con&s;ideration ought not to re|&s;train bounty, or repre&s;s compa&s;&s;ion; for du|ty is to be preferred before convenience, and he that lo&s;es part of the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip by his genero&s;ity, gains in its place the gratulation of his con&s;cience.</P>

<P>OBIDA, the &s;on of Aben&s;ina, left the caravan&s;era early in the morning, and per&s;ued his journey through the plains of Indo&s;tan. He was fre&s;h and vigorous with re&s;t; he was animated with hope; he was in|cited by de&s;ire; he walked &s;wiftly forward
<PB N="250" REF="251">
over the vallies, and &s;aw the hills gradually ri&s;ing before him. As he pa&s;&s;ed along, his ears were delighted with the morning &s;ong of the bird of paradi&s;e, he was fanned by the la&s;t flutters of the &s;inking breeze, and &s;prink|led with dew by groves of &s;pices; he &s;ometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and &s;ometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primro&s;e, elde&s;t daughter of the &s;pring: all his &s;en&s;es were gratified, and all care was bani&s;hed from his heart.</P>
<P>THUS he went on till the &s;un approached his meridian, and the increa&s;ing heat preyed upon his &s;trength; he then looked round about him for &s;ome more commodious path. He &s;aw, on his right hand, a grove that &s;eemed to wave its &s;hades as a &s;ign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolne&s;s and verdure irre&s;i&s;tibly plea&s;ant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling, but found a narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the &s;ame direction with the main road, and was plea&s;ed that, by this hap|py experiment, he had found means to unite plea&s;ure with bu&s;ine&s;s, and to gain the re|wards of diligence without &s;uffering its fa|tigues.
<PB N="251" REF="252">
He, therefore, &s;till continued to walk for a time, without the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his ardour, except that he was &s;ometimes tempted to &s;top by the mu&s;ick of the birds, whom the heat had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hade; and &s;ome|times amu&s;ed him&s;elf with plucking the flow|ers that covered the banks on either &s;ide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At la&s;t the green path began to decline from its fir&s;t tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and mur|muring with water-falls. Here Obidah pau&s;|ed for a time, and began to con&s;ider whether it were longer &s;afe to for&s;ake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greate&s;t violence, and that the plain was du&s;ty and uneven, he re|&s;olved to per&s;ue the new path, which he &s;up|po&s;ed only to make a few meanders, in com|pliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at la&s;t in the common road.</P>
<P>HAVING thus calmed his &s;olicitude, he re|newed his pace, though he &s;u&s;pected that he was not gaining ground. This unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every &s;en&s;ation that might &s;ooth or divert him. He li&s;tened
<PB N="252" REF="253">
to every echo, he mounted every hill for a fre&s;h pro&s;pect, he turned a&s;ide to every ca&s;|cade, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with tracing the cour&s;e of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innu|merable circumvolutions. In the&s;e amu&s;e|ments the hours pa&s;&s;ed away uncounted, his deviations had perplexed his memory, and he knew not towards what point to travel. He &s;tood pen&s;ive and confu&s;ed, afraid to go for|ward le&s;t he &s;hould go wrong, yet con&s;cious that the time of loitering was now pa&s;t. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the &s;ky was over-&s;pread with clouds, the day vani&s;hed from before him, and a &s;udden tem|pe&s;t gathered round his head. He was now rou&s;ed by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly, he now &s;aw how happine&s;s is lo&s;t when ea&s;e is con&s;ulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompt|ed him to &s;eek &s;helter in the grove, and de&s;pi|&s;ed the petty curio&s;ity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>HE now re&s;olved to do what remained yet in his power, to tread back the ground which
<PB N="253" REF="254">
he had pa&s;&s;ed, and try to find &s;ome i&s;&s;ue where the wood might open into the plain. He pro|&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and commend|ed his life to the lord of nature. He ro&s;e with confidence and tranquillity, and pre&s;&s;ed on with his &s;abre in his hand, for the bea&s;ts of the de&s;art were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage, and expiration; all the horrors of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude &s;urround|ed him; the winds roared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled from the hills, <Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 lines"></Q></P>
<P>THUS forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whteher he was every mo|ment drawing nearer to &s;afety or to de&s;truction. At length not fear but labour began to over|come him; his breath grew &s;hort, and his knees crembled, and he was on the point of lying down in re&s;ignation to his fate, when he beheld through the brambles the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door,
<PB N="254" REF="255">
and obtained admi&s;&s;ion. The old man &s;et before him &s;uch provi&s;ions as he had collected for him&s;elf, on which Obidah fed with eager|ne&s;s and gratitude.</P>
<P>WHEN the repa&s;t was over, "Tell me, &s;aid the hermit, by what chance thou ha&s;t been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilder|ne&s;s, in which I never &s;aw a man before." Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or pallia|tion.</P>
<P>"SON, &s;aid the hermit, let the errors and follies, the dangers and e&s;cape of this day, &s;ink deep into thy heart. Remember, my &s;on, that human life is the journey of a day. We ri&s;e in the morning of youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we &s;et forward with &s;pirit and hope, with gaie|ty and with diligence, and travel on a while in the &s;treight road of piety towards the man&s;ions of re&s;t. In a &s;hort time we remit our fervor, and endeavour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of obtaining the &s;ame end.
<PB N="255" REF="256">
We then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a di|&s;tance, but rely upon our own con&s;tancy, and venture to approach what we re&s;olve never to touch. We thus enter the bow|ers of ea&s;e, and repo&s;e in the &s;hades of &s;e|curity. Here the heart &s;oftens, and vigi|lance &s;ub&s;ides; we are then willing to en|quire whether another advance cannot be made, and whether we may not, at lea&s;t, turn our eyes upon the gardens of plea&s;ure. We approach them with &s;cruple and he&s;i|tation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pa&s;s through them without lo&s;ing the road of virtue, which we, for a while, keep in our &s;ight, and to which we purpo&s;e to re|turn. But temptation &s;ucceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for ano|ther; we in time lo&s;e the happine&s;s of in|nocence, and &s;olace our di&s;quiet with &s;en|&s;ual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of ratio|nal de&s;ire. We entangle our&s;elves in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, immerge our&s;elves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of incon&s;tancy till the darkne&s;s of old age begins to in|vade
<PB N="256" REF="257">
us, and di&s;ea&s;e and anxiety ob&s;truct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with &s;orrow, with re|pentance; and wi&s;h, but too often vainly wi&s;h, that we had not for&s;aken the ways of virtue. Happy are they, my &s;on, who &s;hall learn from thy example not to de|&s;pair, but &s;hall remember, that though the day is pa&s;t, and their &s;trength is wa&s;ted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that reformation is never hopele&s;s, nor &s;incere endeavours ever una&s;&s;i&s;ted, that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors, and that he who implores &s;trength and courage from above, &s;hall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my &s;on, to thy repo&s;e, commit thy|&s;elf to the care of omnipotence, and when the morning calls again to toil, begin a new thy journey and thy life."</P>

<P>THE folly of human wi&s;hes and per&s;uits has always been a &s;tanding &s;ubject of mirth and declamation, and has been ridicul|ed and lamented from age to age; till perhaps the fruitle&s;s repetition of complaints and cen|&s;ures may be ju&s;tly numbered among the &s;ub|jects of cen&s;ure and complaint.</P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e in&s;tructors of mankind have not contented them&s;elves with checking the overflows of pa&s;&s;ion, and lopping the exube|rance of de&s;ire, but have attempted to de|&s;troy the root as well as the branches; and not only to confine the mind within bounds, but to &s;mooth it forever by a dead calm. They have employed their rea&s;on and their eloquence to per&s;uade us, that nothing is worth the wi&s;h of a wi&s;e man, have repre&s;ented all earthly good and evil as indifferent, and counted among vulgar errors the dread of pain, and the love of life.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">
IT is almo&s;t always the unhappine&s;s of a vic|torious di&s;putant, to de&s;troy his own authori|ty by claiming too many con&s;equences, or diffu&s;ing his propo&s;ition to an indefen&s;ible ex|tent. When we have heated our zeal in a cau&s;e, and elated our confidence with &s;ucce&s;s, we are naturally inclined to per&s;ue the &s;ame train of rea&s;oning, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome collateral truth, to remove &s;ome adjacent difficulty, and to take in the whole comprehen&s;ion of our &s;y&s;tem. As a prince in the ardour of acqui|&s;ition, is willing to &s;ecure his fir&s;t conque&s;t by the addition of another, add fortre&s;s to fortre&s;s, and city to city, till de&s;pair and op|portunity turn his enemies upon him, and he lo&s;es in a moment the glory of a reign.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;ophers having found an ea&s;y victory over tho&s;e de&s;ires which we produce in our&s;elves, and which terminate in &s;ome imaginary &s;tate of happine&s;s unknown and unattainable, proceeded to make further inroads upon the heart, and attacked at la&s;t our &s;en|&s;es and our in&s;tincts. They continued to war upon nature with arms, by which only folly could be conquered; they therefore lo&s;t the trophies of their former combats, and were
<PB N="259" REF="260">
con&s;idered no longer with reverence or re|gard.</P>
<P>YET it cannot be with ju&s;tice denied, that the&s;e men have been very u&s;eful monitors, and have left many proofs of &s;trong rea|&s;on, deep penetration, and accurate attention to the affairs of life, which it is now our bu|&s;ine&s;s to &s;eparate from the foam of a boiling imagination, and to apply judiciou&s;ly to our own u&s;e. They have &s;hewn that mo&s;t of the conditions of life, which rai&s;e the envy of the timorous, and rou&s;e the ambition of the daring, are empty &s;hows of felicity, which, when they become familiar, lo&s;e their power of de|lighting; and that the mo&s;t pro&s;perous and exalted have very few advantages over a meaner and more ob&s;cure fortune, when their dangers and &s;olicitudes are balanced again&s;t their equi|page, their banquets, and their palaces.</P>
<P>IT is natural for every man, unin&s;tructed and unenlightened, to murmur at his condition, becau&s;e, in the general infelicity of life, he feels his own mi&s;eries, without knowing that they are common to all the re&s;t of the &s;pecies; and therefore though he will not be le&s;s &s;en&s;i|ble of pain by being told that others are equal|ly
<PB N="260" REF="261">
tormented, he will at lea&s;t be freed from the temptation of &s;eeking by perpetual chan|ges that ea&s;e which is no where to be found, and though his di&s;ea&s;e &s;till continues, he e|&s;capes the hazard of exa&s;perating it by remedies.</P>
<P>THE gratifications which affluence of wealth, extent of power, and eminence of reputation confer, mu&s;t be always, by their own nature, confined to a very &s;mall number; and the life of the greater part of mankind mu&s;t be lo&s;t in empty wi&s;hes and painful com|pari&s;ons, were not the balm of philo&s;ophy &s;hed upon us, and our di&s;content at the ap|pearances of unequal di&s;tribution &s;oothed and appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT &s;eemed, perhaps, below the dignity of the great ma&s;ters of moral learning, to de|&s;cend to familiar life, and caution mankind again&s;t that petty ambition, which is known among us by the name of vanity; which yet had been an undertaking not unworthy of the longe&s;t beard, and mo&s;t &s;olemn au&s;terity. For though the pa&s;&s;ions of little minds, act|ing in low &s;tations, do not fill the world with blood&s;hed and deva&s;tations, or mark, by great events, the periods of time, yet they torture
<PB N="261" REF="262">
the brea&s;t which they happen to &s;eize, infe&s;t tho&s;e that are placed within the reach of their influence, de&s;troy private quiet and private vir|tue, and undermine, in&s;en&s;ibly, the happine&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire of excellence is laudable, but is very frequently ill directed. We fall, by chance, into &s;ome cla&s;s of mankind, and, with|out con&s;ulting nature or wi&s;dom, re&s;olve to gain their regard by tho&s;e qualities which they happen to e&s;teem. I once knew a man remarkably dim&s;ighted, who, by conver&s;ing much with country gentlemen, found him&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly determined to &s;ylvan honours, and was very de&s;irous to be thought a &s;kilful &s;port&s;man. His great ambition was to &s;hoot flying, and he therefore &s;pent whole days in the woods per&s;uing game; which, before he was near enough to &s;ee them, his approach al|ways frighted away.</P>
<P>WHEN it happens that the de&s;ire tends to ob|jects which produce no competition, it may be overlooked with &s;ome indulgence, becau&s;e, however fruitle&s;s or ab&s;urd, it cannot have ill effects upon the morals. But mo&s;t of our en|joyments owe their value to the peculiarity of
<PB N="262" REF="263">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and when they are rated at too high a value, give occa&s;ion to &s;tratagems of malig|nity, and incite oppo&s;ition, hatred, and defa|mation. The conte&s;t of two rural beauties for preference and di&s;tinction, is often &s;uffi|ciently keen and rancorous to fill their brea&s;ts with all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which are gene|rally thought the cur&s;e only of &s;enates, of armies, and of courts; and the rival dancers of an ob&s;cure a&s;&s;embly have their parti&s;ans and abettors, often not le&s;s exa&s;perated again&s;t each other, than tho&s;e who are promot|ing the intere&s;ts of rival monarchs.</P>
<P>IT is common to con&s;ider tho&s;e whom we find infected with an unrea&s;onable regard for trifling accompli&s;hments, as ju&s;tly chargeable with all the con&s;equences of their folly, and as the authors of their own unhappine&s;s: but, perhaps, tho&s;e whom we thus &s;corn or dete&s;t, have more claim to tenderne&s;s than has been yet allowed them. Before we permit our &s;e|verity to break loo&s;e upon any fault or error, we ought &s;urely to con&s;ider how much we have countenanced or promoted it. We &s;ee multitudes bu&s;y in the per&s;uit of riches, at the expence of wi&s;dom and of virtue; but we &s;ee the re&s;t of mankind approving their conduct,
<PB N="263" REF="264">
and inciting their eagerne&s;s, by paying that re|gard and deference to wealth, which wi&s;dom and virtue only can de&s;erve. We &s;ee women univer&s;ally jealous of the reputation of their beauty, and frequently look with contempt on the care with which they &s;tudy their com|plexions, endeavour to pre&s;erve or to &s;upply the bloom of youth, regulate every ornament, twi&s;t their hair into curls, and &s;hade their fa|ces from the weather. We often recommend to them the care of their nobler part, and tell them how little addition is made by all their arts to the graces of the mind. But when was it known that female virtue or knowledge was able to attract that officiou&s;ne&s;s, or in&s;pire that ardour which beauty produces whenever it ap|pears? And with what hope can we endeavour to per&s;uade the ladies, that the time &s;pent at the toilet is lo&s;t in vanity, when they have every moment &s;ome new conviction, that their intere&s;t is more effectually promoted by a rib|band well di&s;po&s;ed, than by the brighte&s;t act of heroick virtue?</P>
<P>IN every in&s;tance of vanity it will be found, that the blame ought to be &s;hared among more than it generally reaches; all who exalt trifles by immoderate prai&s;e, or in&s;tigate needle&s;s
<PB N="264" REF="265">
emulation by invidious incitements, are to be con&s;idered as perverters of rea&s;on, and cor|rupters of the world: and &s;ince every man is obliged to promote happine&s;s and virtue, he &s;hould be careful not to mi&s;lead unwary minds, by appearing to &s;et too high a value upon things by which no real excellence is conferred.</P>

<P>THERE is no temper &s;o univer&s;ally in|dulged as hope: other pa&s;&s;ions ope|rate by &s;tarts on particular occa&s;ions, or in certain parts of life; but hope begins with the fir&s;t power of comparing our actual with our po&s;&s;ible &s;tate, and attends us through every &s;tage and period of our lives, always urging us forward to new acqui&s;itions, and holding out &s;ome di&s;tant ble&s;&s;ing to our view, promi&s;|ing us either relief from pain, or increa&s;e of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>HOPE is nece&s;&s;ary in every condition. The mi&s;eries of poverty, of &s;ickne&s;s, of cap|tivity,
<PB N="265" REF="266">
would, without this comfort, be in&s;up|portable; nor does it appear that the happie&s;t lot of terre&s;trial exi&s;tence can &s;et us above the want of this general ble&s;&s;ing, or that life, when the gifts of nature and of fortune are accumulated upon it, would not &s;till be wretched, were it not elevated and delighted by the expectation of &s;ome new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of &s;ome enjoyment yet behind, by which the wi&s;h &s;hall be at la&s;t &s;atisfied, and the heart filled up to its utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>HOPE is, indeed, very fallacious, and promi&s;es what it &s;eldom gives; but its pro|mi&s;es are more valuable than the gifts of for|tune, and it &s;eldom fru&s;trates us without a&s;&s;u|ring us of recompen&s;ing the delay by a greater bounty.</P>
<P>I WAS mu&s;ing on this &s;trange inclination which every man feels to deceive him&s;elf, and con&s;idering the advantages and dangers pro|ceeding from this gay pro&s;pect of futurity, when, falling a&s;leep, on a &s;udden I found my&s;elf placed in a garden, of which my &s;ight could de&s;cry no limits. Every &s;cene about me was gay and glad&s;ome, light with &s;un|&s;hine, and fragrant with perfumes; the ground
<PB N="266" REF="267">
was painted with all the variety of &s;pring, and all the choir of nature was &s;inging in the groves. When I had recovered from the fir&s;t raptures, with which the confu&s;ion of plea&s;ure had for a time entranced me, I began to take a particular and deliberate view of this delight|ful region. I then perceived that I had yet higher gratifications to expect, and that, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from me, there were brighter flowers, clearer fountains, and more lo&s;ty groves, where the birds, which I yet heard but faintly, were exerting all the power of melody. The trees about me were beautiful with verdure, and fragrant with blo&s;&s;oms; but I was tempted to leave them by the &s;ight of ripe fruits, which &s;eemed to hang only to be plucked. I therefore walked ha&s;tily forwards, but found, as I proceeded, that the colours of the field faded at my approach, the fruit fell before I reached it, the birds flew &s;till &s;inging before me, and though I pre&s;&s;ed onward with great celerity, I was &s;till in &s;ight of plea&s;ures of which I could not yet gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and which &s;eemed to mock my diligence, and to retire as I advanced.</P>
<P>THOUGH I was confounded with &s;o many alternations of joy and grief, I yet per&s;i&s;ted to
<PB N="267" REF="268">
go forward, in hopes that the&s;e fugitive de|lights would in time be overtaken. At length I &s;aw an innumerable multitude of every age and &s;ex, who &s;eemed all to partake of &s;ome ge|neral felicity; for every cheek was flu&s;hed with confidence, and every eye &s;parkled with eagerne&s;s: yet each appeared to have &s;ome particular and &s;ecret plea&s;ure, and very few were willing to communicate their intentions, or extend their concern beyond them&s;elves. Mo&s;t of them &s;eemed, by the rapidity of their motion, too bu&s;y to gratify the curio&s;ity of a &s;tranger, and therefore I was content for a while to gaze upon them, without interrupting them with trouble&s;ome enquiries. At la&s;t I ob&s;erved one man worn with time, and unable to &s;truggle in the croud; and, therefore, &s;up|po&s;ing him more at lei&s;ure, I began to acco&s;t him: but he turned from me with anger, and told me he mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed, for the great hour of projection was now come, when Mercury &s;hould lo&s;e his wings, and &s;lave|ry &s;hould no longer dig the mine for gold.</P>
<P>I LEFT hin, and attempted another, who&s;e &s;oftne&s;s of mien, and ea&s;y movement, gave me rea&s;on to hope for a more agreeable re|ception: but he told me, with a low bow,
<PB N="268" REF="269">
that nothing would make him more happy than an opportunity of &s;erving me, which he could not now want, for a place which he had been twenty years &s;oliciting would be &s;oon va|cant. From him I had recour&s;e to the next, who was departing in ha&s;te to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate of an uncle, who by the cour&s;e of nature could not live long. He that follow|ed was preparing to dive for trea&s;ure in a new-invented bell; and another was on the point of di&s;covering the longitude.</P>
<P>BEING thus rejected where&s;oever I applied my&s;elf for information, I began to imagine it be&s;t to de&s;i&s;t from enquiry, and try what my own ob&s;ervation would di&s;cover: but &s;eeing a young man, gay and thoughtle&s;s, I re&s;olved upon one more experiment, and was informed that I was in the garden of HOPE, the daughter of DESIRE, and that all tho&s;e whom I &s;aw thus tumultuou&s;ly bu&s;tling round me, were incited by the promi&s;es of HOPE, and ha&s;tening to &s;eize the gifts which &s;he held in her hand.</P>
<P>I TURNED my &s;ight upward, and &s;aw a godde&s;s in the bloom of youth, &s;itting on a throne: around her lay all the gifts of fortune,
<PB N="269" REF="270">
and all the ble&s;&s;ings of life were &s;pread abroad to view; &s;he had a perpetual gayety of a&s;pect, and every one imagined that her &s;mile, which was impartial and general, was directed to him&s;elf, and triumphed in his own &s;uperiority to others, who had conceived the &s;ame confi|dence from the &s;ame mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I THEN mounted an eminence, from which I had a more exten&s;ive view of the whole place, and could with le&s;s perplexity con&s;ider the different conduct of the crouds that filled it. From this &s;tation I ob&s;erved, that the en|trance into the garden of HOPE was by two gates, one of which was kept by REASON, and the other by FANCY. REASON was &s;ur|ly and &s;crupulous, and &s;eldom turned the key without many interrogatories, and long he&s;i|tation; but FANCY was a kind and gentle por|tre&s;s, &s;he held her gate wide open, and wel|comed all equally to the di&s;trict under her &s;uperintendency; &s;o that the pa&s;&s;age was crouded by all tho&s;e who either feared the ex|amination of REASON, or had been rejected by her.</P>
<P>FROM the gate of REASON there was a way to the throne of HOPE, by a craggy
<PB N="270" REF="271">
&s;lippery, and winding path, called the <HI>Streight of Difficulty,</HI> which tho&s;e who entered with the permi&s;&s;ion of the guard endeavoured to climb. But tho' they &s;urveyed the way very chearful|ly before they began to ri&s;e, and marked out the &s;everal &s;tages of their progre&s;s, they com|monly found unexpected ob&s;tacles, and were obliged frequently to &s;top on the &s;udden, where they imagined the way plain and even. A thou&s;and intricacies embarra&s;&s;ed them, a thou&s;and &s;lips threw them back, and a thou|&s;and pitfals impeded their advance. So for|midable were the dangers, and &s;o frequent the mi&s;carriages, that many returned from the fir&s;t attempt, and many fainted in the mid&s;t of the way, and only a very &s;mall number were led up to the &s;ummit of HOPE, by the hand of FORTITUDE. Of the&s;e few the greater part, when they had obtained the gift which HOPE had promi&s;ed them, regretted the labour which it co&s;t, and felt in their &s;uc|ce&s;s the regret of di&s;appointment; the re&s;t re|tired with their prize, and were led by WIS|DOM to the bowers of CONTENT.</P>
<P>TURNING then towards the gate of FAN|CY, I could find no way to the &s;eat of HOPE: but though &s;he &s;at full in view, and held out
<PB N="271" REF="272">
her gifts with an air of invitation, which fill|ed every heart with rapture, the mountain was, on that &s;ide, inacce&s;&s;ibly &s;teep, but &s;o channelled and &s;haded, that none perceived the impo&s;&s;ibility of a&s;cending it, but each ima|gined him&s;elf to have di&s;covered a way to which the re&s;t were &s;trangers. Many expe|dients were indeed tried by this indu&s;trious tribe, of whom &s;ome were making them&s;elves wings, which others were contriving to actu|ate by the perpetual motion. But, with all their labour, and all their artifices, they never ro&s;e above the ground, or quickly fell back, nor ever approached the throne of HOPE, but continued &s;till to gaze at a di&s;tance, and laughed at the &s;low progre&s;s of tho&s;e whom they &s;aw toiling in the <HI>Streight of Difficulty.</HI></P>
<P>PART of the favourites of FANCY, when they had entered the garden, without mak|ing, like the re&s;t, any attempt to climb the mountain, turned immediately to the vale of IDLENESS, a calm and undi&s;turbed retirement, from whence they could always have HOPE in pro&s;pect, and to which they plea&s;ed them|&s;elves with believing that &s;he intended &s;peedily to de&s;cend. The&s;e were indeed &s;corned by all the re&s;t, but they &s;eemed very little affect|ed
<PB N="272" REF="273">
by contempt, advice, or reproof, but were re&s;olved to expect at ea&s;e the favour of the godde&s;s.</P>
<P>AMONG this gay race I was wandering, and found them ready to an&s;wer all my que&s;ti|ons, and willing to communicate their mirth: but turning round I &s;aw two dreadful mon&s;ters entring the vale, one of whom I knew to be AGE, and the other WANT. Sport and re|velling were now at an end, and an univer&s;al &s;hrick of affright and di&s;tre&s;s bur&s;t out and awaked me.</P>

<P>THE younger Pliny has very ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved, that of actions which de&s;erve our attention, the mo&s;t &s;plendid are not al|ways the greate&s;t. Fame, and wonder, and
<PB N="273" REF="274">
applau&s;e, are not excited but by external and adventitious circum&s;tances, often di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from virtue and heroi&s;m. Eminence of &s;tation, greatne&s;s of effect, and all the favours of fortune, mu&s;t concur to place ex|cellence in publick view; but fortitude, and diligence, and patience, dive&s;ted of their &s;how, glide unob&s;erved through the croud of life, and &s;uffer and act, though with the &s;ame vigour and con&s;tancy, yet without pity and without prai&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS remark may be extended to all parts of life. Nothing is to be e&s;timated by its effect upon common eyes and common ears. A thou&s;and mi&s;eries make &s;ilent and invi&s;ible inroads on mankind, and the heart feels innu|merable throbs, which never break into com|plaint. Perhaps, likewi&s;e, our plea&s;ures are for the mo&s;t part equally &s;ecret, and mo&s;t are born up by &s;ome private &s;atisfaction, &s;ome in|ternal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ome latent hope, &s;ome peculiar pro&s;pect, which they never commu|nicate, but re&s;erve for &s;olitary hours, and clan|de&s;tine meditation.</P>
<P>THE main of life is, indeed, compo&s;ed of &s;mall incidents, and petty occurrences; of
<PB N="274" REF="275">
wi&s;hes for objects not remote, and grief for di&s;appointments of no fatal con&s;equence; of in&s;ect vexations which &s;ting us and fly away, impertinences which buzz a while about us, and are heard no more; of meteorous plea|&s;ures which dance before us and are di&s;&s;ipated, of compliments which glide off the &s;oul like other mu&s;ick, and are forgotten by him that gave and him that received them.</P>
<P>SUCH is the general heap out of which e|very man is to cull his own condition: for, as the chymi&s;ts tell us, that all bodies are re|&s;olvable into the &s;ame elements, and that the bound le&s;s variety of things ari&s;es from the dif|ferent proportions of very few ingredients; &s;o a few pains, and a few plea&s;ures are all the materials of human life, and of the&s;e the pro|portions are partly allotted by providence, and partly left to the arrangement of rea&s;on and of choice.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e are well or ill di&s;po&s;ed, man is for the mo&s;t part happy or mi&s;erable. For very few are involved in great events, or have their thread of life entwi&s;ted with the chain of cau&s;es on which armies or nations are &s;u&s;|pended; and even tho&s;e who &s;eem wholly

bu&s;ied in publick affairs, and elevated above low cares, or trivial plea&s;ures, pa&s;s the chief part of their time in familiar and dome&s;tick &s;cenes; from the&s;e they came into publick life, to the&s;e they are every hour recalled by pa&s;&s;ions not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; in the&s;e they have the reward of their toils, and to the&s;e at la&s;t they retire.</P>
<P>THE great end of prudence is to give chearfulne&s;s to tho&s;e hours, which &s;plendour cannot gild, and acclamation cannot exhila|rate; tho&s;e &s;oft intervals of unbended amu&s;e|ment, in which a man &s;hrinks to his own natural dimen&s;ions, and throws a&s;ide the or|naments or di&s;gui&s;es, which he feels in priva|cy to be u&s;ele&s;s incumbrances, and to lo&s;e all effect when they become familiar. To be happy at home is the ultimate re&s;ult of all ambition, the end to which every enterpri&s;e and labour tends, and of which every de&s;ire prompts the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>IT is, indeed, at home that every man mu&s;t be known, by tho&s;e who would make a ju&s;t e&s;timate either of his virtue or felicity; for &s;miles and embroidery are alike occa&s;ional,
<PB N="276" REF="277">
and the mind is often dre&s;&s;ed for &s;how in painted honour, and fictitious benevolence.</P>
<P>EVERY man mu&s;t have found &s;ome who&s;e lives, in every hou&s;e but their own, was a continual &s;eries of hypocri&s;y, and who con|cealed under fair appearances bad qualities, which, whenever they thought them&s;elves out of the reach of cen&s;ure, broke out from their re&s;traint, like winds impri&s;oned in their ca|verns, and whom every one had rea&s;on to love, but they who&s;e love a wi&s;e man is chiefly &s;olicitous to procure. And there are others who, without any &s;how of general goodne&s;s, and without the attractions, by which popu|larity is conciliated, are received among their own families as be&s;towers of happine&s;s, and reverenced as in&s;tructors, guardians, and be|nefactors.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t authentick witne&s;&s;es of any man's character are tho&s;e who know him in his own family, and &s;ee him without any re|&s;traint, or rule of conduct, but &s;uch as he voluntarily pre&s;cribes to him&s;elf. If a man carries virtue with him into his private apart|ments, and takes no advantage of unlimited power, or probable &s;ecre&s;y; if we trace him
<PB N="277" REF="278">
through the round of his time, and find that his character, with tho&s;e allowances which mortal frailty mu&s;t always want, is uniform and regular, we have all the evidence of his &s;incerity, that one man can have with regard to another; and, indeed, as hypocri&s;y cannot be its own reward, we may, without he&s;ita|tion, determine that his heart is pure.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t panegyrick, therefore, that private virtue can receive, is the prai&s;e of &s;er|vants. For, however vanity or in&s;olence may look down with contempt on the &s;uffrage of men, undignified by wealth, and unenlight|ened by education, it very &s;eldom happens that they commend or blame without ju&s;tice. Vice and virtue are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. Op|pre&s;&s;ion, according to Harrington's aphori&s;m, will be felt by tho&s;e that cannot &s;ee it; and, perhaps, it falls out very often that, in moral que&s;tions, the philo&s;ophers in the gown, and in the livery, differ not &s;o much in their &s;en|timents, as in their language, and have equal power of di&s;cerning right, though they can|not point it out to others with equal addre&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE are very few faults to be commit|ted in &s;olitude, or without &s;ome agents, part|ners,
<PB N="278" REF="279">
confederates, or witne&s;&s;es; and, there|fore, the &s;ervant mu&s;t commonly know the &s;ecrets of a ma&s;ter, who has any &s;ecrets to en|tru&s;t; and failings, merely per&s;onal, are &s;o frequently expo&s;ed by that &s;ecurity which pride and folly generally produce, and &s;o in|qui&s;itively watched by that de&s;ire of reducing the inequalities of condition, which the low|er orders of the world will always feel, that the te&s;timony of a menial dome&s;tick can &s;el|dom be con&s;idered as defective for want of knowledge. And though its impartiality may be &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected, it is at lea&s;t as credible as that of equals, where rivalry in&s;tigates cen|&s;ure, or friend&s;hip dictates palliations.</P>
<P>THE danger of betraying our weakne&s;s to our &s;ervants, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of conceal|ing it from them, may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as one motive to a regular and irreproachable life. For no condition is more hateful or de&s;pica|ble, than his who has put him&s;elf in the pow|er of his &s;ervant; in the power of him whom, perhaps, he has fir&s;t corrupted by making him &s;ub&s;ervient to his vices, and who&s;e fidelity he therefore cannot enforce by any precepts of hone&s;ty or rea&s;on. It is &s;eldom known that authority, thus acquired, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without
<PB N="279" REF="280">
in&s;olence, or that the ma&s;ter is not forced to confe&s;s, by his tamene&s;s or forbearance, that he has en&s;laved him&s;elf by &s;ome fooli&s;h confi|dence. And his crime is equally puni&s;hed, whatever part he takes of the choice to which he is reduced; and he is, from that fatal hour, in which he &s;acrificed his dignity to his pa&s;&s;ions, in perpetual dread of in&s;olence or defamation; of a controuler at home, or an accu&s;er abroad. He is condemned to purcha&s;e, by continual bribes, that &s;ecre&s;y which bribes never &s;ecured, and which, after a long cour&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, promi&s;es, and anxieties, he will find violated in a fit of rage, or in a fro|lick of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>TO dread no eye, and to &s;u&s;pect no tongue, is the great prerogative of innocence; an ex|emption granted only to invariable virtue. But guilt has always its horrors and &s;olicitudes; and, to make it yet more &s;hameful and de|te&s;table, is doomed often to &s;tand in awe of tho&s;e, to whom nothing could give influence or weight, but their power of betraying.</P>

<P>AN old Greek epigrammati&s;t, intending to &s;hew the mi&s;eries that attend the la&s;t &s;tage of man, imprecates upon tho&s;e who are &s;o fooli&s;h as to wi&s;h for long life, the calamity of continuing to grow old from century to century. He thought that no adventitious or foreign pain was requi&s;ite, that decrepitude it&s;elf was an epitome of all that is dreadful, and that nothing could be added to the cur&s;e of age, but that it &s;hould be extended beyond its natural limits.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t indifferent or negligent &s;pecta|tor can indeed &s;carcely retire, without heavi|ne&s;s of heart, from a view of the la&s;t &s;cenes of the tragedy of life, in which he finds tho&s;e who in the former parts of the drama were
<PB N="281" REF="282">
di&s;tingui&s;hed by oppo&s;ition of conduct, con|trariety of de&s;igns, and di&s;&s;imilitude of per&s;o|nal qualities, all involved in one common di&s;|tre&s;s, and all &s;truggling with affliction which they cannot hope to overcome.</P>
<P>ALL the other mi&s;eries, which way-lay our pa&s;&s;age through the world, wi&s;dom may e&s;cape, and fortitude may conquer: by caution and circum&s;pection we may &s;teal along with very little to ob&s;truct or incommode us; by &s;pirit and vigour we may force a way, and reward the vexation of conte&s;t by the plea&s;ures of vic|tory. But a time mu&s;t come when all our policy and our bravery &s;hall be equally u&s;ele&s;s; when we &s;hall all &s;ink into helple&s;ne&s;s and &s;adne&s;s, without any power of receiving &s;o|lace from the plea&s;ures that have formerly de|lighted us, or any pro&s;pect of emerging into a &s;econd po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ings that we have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THE indu&s;try of man has, indeed, not been wanting in endeavours to procure com|forts for the&s;e hours of dejection and melan|choly, and to gild the dreadful gloom with artificial light. The mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;upport of old age is wealth. He who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are
<PB N="282" REF="283">
large, and who&s;e che&s;ts are full, imagines him&s;elf always fortified again&s;t inva&s;ions on his authority, and &s;ecure, at lea&s;t from open in&s;ult, and apparent contempt. If he has lo&s;t all other means of government, if his &s;trength and his rea&s;on fail him, he can at lea&s;t alter his will; and therefore all that have hopes mu&s;t likewi&s;e have fears, and he may &s;till continue to give laws to &s;uch as have not cea&s;ed to regard their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS is, indeed, too frequently the citadel of the dotard, the la&s;t fortre&s;s to which age retires, and in which he makes the &s;tand again&s;t the up&s;tart race, that is perpetually &s;eiz|ing his domains, di&s;puting his commands, and cancelling his pre&s;criptions. But here, though there may be &s;afety, there is no plea&s;ure; and what remains is but a proof that more was once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;eems to have been more uni|ver&s;ally dreaded by the ancients than orbity, or want of children; and indeed, to a man who has &s;urvived all the companions of his youth, all who have participated his plea&s;ures and his cares, have been engaged in the &s;ame events, and filled their minds with the &s;ame
<PB N="283" REF="284">
conceptions, this full peopled world is a di&s;|mal &s;olitude. He &s;tands forlorn and &s;ilent, neglected or in&s;ulted, in the mid&s;t of mul|titudes, animated with hopes which he can|not &s;hare, and employed in bu&s;ine&s;s which he is no longer able to forward or retard; nor can he find any to whom his life or his death are of importance, unle&s;s he has &s;ecured &s;ome dome&s;tic gratifications, &s;ome tender employ|ments, and endeared him&s;elf to &s;ome who&s;e intere&s;t and gratitude may unite them to him.</P>
<P>SO different are the colours of life, as we look forward to the future, or backward to the pa&s;t; and &s;o different the opinions and &s;enti|ments which this contrariety of appearance naturally produces, that the conver&s;ation of the old and young ends generally with con|tempt or pity on either &s;ide. To a young man entering the world, with fulne&s;s of hope, and ardor of per&s;uit, nothing is &s;o unplea&s;ing as the cold caution, the &s;aint expectations, the &s;crupulous diffidence which experience and di&s;appointments certainly infu&s;e; and the old man wonders in his turn that the world never can grow wi&s;er, that neither precepts, nor te&s;timonies, can cure boys of their credulity and &s;ufficiency; and that not one can be con|vinced
<PB N="284" REF="285">
that &s;nares are laid for him, till he finds him&s;elf entangled.</P>
<P>THUS one generation is always the &s;corn and wonder of the other, and the notions of the old and young are like liquors of different gravity and texture which never can unite. The &s;pirits of youth, &s;ublimed by health, and volatili&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ion, &s;oon leave behind them the phlegmatic &s;ediment of warine&s;s and deli|beration, and bur&s;t out in temerity and enter|pri&s;e. The tenderne&s;s therefore which nature infu&s;es, and which long habits of beneficence confirm, is nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion; and an old man mu&s;t be a father to bear with patience tho&s;e follies and ab&s;urdities, which he will perpetually imagine him&s;elf to find in the &s;chemes and expectations, the plea|&s;ures and the &s;orrows, of tho&s;e who have not yet been hardened by time, and chilled by fru&s;tration.</P>
<P>YET it may be doubted, whether the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing children ripening into &s;trength and importance, be not overbalanced by the pain of &s;eeing &s;ome fall in the blo&s;&s;om, and others bla&s;ted in their growth; &s;ome &s;haken down by &s;torms, &s;ome tainted with cankers,
<PB N="285" REF="286">
and &s;ome &s;hrivelled in the &s;hade; and whe|ther he that extends his care beyond him&s;elf, does not multiply his anxieties more than his plea&s;ure, and weary him&s;elf to no purpo&s;e by &s;uperintending what he cannot regulate.</P>
<P>BUT though age be to every order of human being &s;ufficiently terrible, it is particularly to be dreaded by fine ladies, who have had no other end or ambition, than to fill up the day and the night, with dre&s;s, diver&s;ions and flat|tery, and who having made no acquaintance with knowledge, or with bu&s;ine&s;s, have con|&s;tantly caught all their ideas from the current prattle of the hour, and been indebted for all their happine&s;s to compliments and treats. With the&s;e ladies, age begins early, and very often la&s;ts long; it begins when their beauty fades, when their mirth lo&s;es its &s;prightline&s;s, and their motion its ca&s;e. From that time all that gave them joy vani&s;hes from about them; they hear the prai&s;es be&s;towed on others, which u&s;ed to &s;well their bo&s;oms with exultation. They vi&s;it the &s;eats of &s;elicity, and endeavour to continue the habit of being delighted. But plea&s;ure is only received when we believe that we give it in return; and neglect and petulance &s;oon inform them that their power
<PB N="286" REF="287">
and their value are pa&s;t; and what then re|mains but a tedious and comfortle&s;s uniformity of time, without any motion of the heart, or exerci&s;e of the rea&s;on?</P>
<P>YET, however age may di&s;courage us by its appearance from con&s;idering it in pro&s;pect, we &s;hall all by degrees certainly be old; and therefore we ought to enquire, what provi&s;ion can be made again&s;t that time of di&s;tre&s;s? what happine&s;s can be &s;tored up again&s;t the winter of life? and how we may pa&s;s our latter years with &s;erenity and chearfulne&s;s?</P>
<P>IF it has been found by the experience of mankind, that no &s;ea&s;on of life is able to &s;up|ply it&s;elf with &s;ufficient gratifications, with|out anticipating uncertain felicities, it cannot &s;urely be &s;uppo&s;ed, that old age, worn with labours, harra&s;&s;ed with anxieties, and tortured with di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hould have any gladne&s;s of its own, or feel any &s;atisfaction from the con|templation of the pre&s;ent. All the comfort that can now be expected mu&s;t be recalled from the pa&s;t, or borrowed from the future; the pa&s;t is too often very &s;oon exhau&s;ted, all the events or actions of which the memory can afford plea&s;ure are quickly recollected; and
<PB N="287" REF="288">
the future lies beyond the grave, where it can be reached only by virtue and devotion.</P>
<P>PIETY, then, is the only proper and ade|quate relief of decaying man, &s;ince this world can give him no further pro&s;pects. He, there|fore, that grows old without religious hopes, as he declines into imbecillity, and feels pains and &s;orrows ince&s;&s;antly crowding upon him, falls into a gulph of bottomle&s;s mi&s;ery, in which every reflection mu&s;t plunge him deep|er, and where he finds only new gradations of angui&s;h, and precipices of horrour.</P>

<P>HESIOD, in his celebrated di&s;tribution of mankind, divides them into three orders of intellect. "The fir&s;t place, &s;ays he, belongs to him that can by his own powers di&s;cern what is right and fit, and penetrate to the remoter motives of action. The &s;econd is claimed by him that is willing
<PB N="288" REF="289">
to hear in&s;truction, and can perceive right and wrong when they are &s;hewn him by another; but he that has neither acutene&s;s nor docility, who can neither find the way by him&s;elf, nor will be led by others, is a wretch without u&s;e or value."</P>
<P>IF we &s;urvey the moral world, it will be found, that the &s;ame divi&s;ion may be made of men, with regard to their virtue. There are &s;ome who&s;e principles are &s;o firmly fixed, who&s;e conviction is &s;o con&s;tantly pre&s;ent to their minds, and who have rai&s;ed in them|&s;elves &s;uch ardent wi&s;hes for the approbation of God, and the happine&s;s with which he has promi&s;ed to reward obedience and per&s;eve|rance, that they ri&s;e above all other cares and con&s;iderations, and uniformly examine every action and every de&s;ire, by comparing it with the divine commands. There are others in a kind of equipoi&s;e between good and ill; who are moved on one part by riches or plea&s;ure, by the gratifications of pa&s;&s;ion, and the de|lights of &s;en&s;e; and, on the other, by laws of which they own the obligation, and rewards of which they believe the reality, and whom a very &s;mall addition of weight turns either way. The third cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of beings im|mer&s;ed
<PB N="289" REF="290">
in plea&s;ure, or abandoned to pa&s;&s;ion, without any de&s;ire of higher good, or any effort to extend their thoughts beyond imme|diate and gro&s;s &s;atisfactions.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd cla&s;s is &s;o much more numerous than the fir&s;t and la&s;t, that it may be con&s;i|dered as compri&s;ing the whole body of man|kind. Tho&s;e of the la&s;t are not very many, and of the fir&s;t are very few; and neither the one nor the other fall much under the con&s;i|deration of the morali&s;t, who&s;e precepts are intended chiefly for tho&s;e who are endeavour|ing to go forward up the &s;teeps of virtue, not for tho&s;e who have already reached the &s;um|mit, or tho&s;e who are re&s;olved to &s;tay for ever in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>TO a man not ver&s;ed in the living world, but accu&s;tomed to judge of every thing only by &s;peculative rea&s;on, it is &s;carcely credible that any one &s;hould be in this &s;tate of indif|ference, or &s;tand undetermined and unenga|ged, ready to follow the fir&s;t call to either &s;ide. It &s;eems certain, that a man either mu&s;t believe that virtue will make him happy, and re&s;olve therefore to be virtuous, or think that he may be happy without virtue, and there|fore
<PB N="290" REF="291">
ca&s;t off all care but for his pre&s;ent inter|e&s;t. It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that conviction &s;hould be on one &s;ide, and practice on the other; and that he who has &s;een the right way, &s;hould voluntarily &s;hut his eyes, that he may quit it with more tranquillity. Yet all the&s;e ab&s;urdities are every hour to be found; the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men deviate from known and acknowledged duties, by inadvertency or &s;ur|pri&s;e; and mo&s;t are good no longer than while temptation is away, than while their pa&s;&s;ions are without excitements, and their opinions are free from the counteraction of any other motive.</P>
<P>AMONG the &s;entiments which almo&s;t every man changes as he advances into years, is the expectation of uniformity of character. He that without acquaintance with the power of de&s;ire, the cogency of di&s;tre&s;s, the complica|tions of affairs, or the force of particular in|fluence, has filled his mind with the excel|lence of virtue; he who having never tried his re&s;olution in any encounters with hope or fear, believes it able to &s;tand firm whatever &s;hall oppo&s;e it, will be always clamorous a|gain&s;t the &s;malle&s;t failure, ready to exact the utmo&s;t punctualities of right, and to con&s;ider
<PB N="291" REF="292">
every man that fails in any part of his duty, as without con&s;cience and without merit; un|worthy of tru&s;t, or love, or pity, or regard; as an enemy whom all &s;hould join to drive out of &s;ociety, as a pe&s;t which all &s;hould avoid, or as a weed which all &s;hould trample.</P>
<P>IT is not but by experience, that we are taught the po&s;&s;ibility of retaining &s;ome vir|tues, and rejecting others, or of being good or bad to a particular degree. For it is very ea&s;y to the &s;olitary rea&s;oner to prove that the &s;ame arguments by which the mind is fortifi|ed again&s;t one crime are of equal force again&s;t all, and the con&s;equence very naturally fol|lows, that he whom they fail to move on any occa&s;ion, has either never con&s;idered them, or has by &s;ome fallacy taught him&s;elf to evade their validity; and that, therefore, when a man is known to be guilty of one crime, no farther evidence is needful of his depravity and corruption.</P>
<P>YET &s;uch is the &s;tate of all mortal virtue, that it is always uncertain and variable, &s;ome|times extending to the whole compa&s;s of du|ty, and &s;ometimes &s;hrinking into a narrow &s;pace, and fortifying only a few avenues of
<PB N="292" REF="293">
the heart, while all the re&s;t is left open to the incur&s;ions of appetite, or given up to the do|minion of wickedne&s;s. Nothing therefore is more unju&s;t than to judge of man by too &s;hort an acquintance, and too &s;light in&s;pection; for it often happens, that in the loo&s;e, and thoughtle&s;s, and di&s;&s;ipated, there is a &s;ecret ra|dical worth, which may &s;hoot out by proper cultivation; that the &s;park of heaven, though dimmed and ob&s;tructed, is yet not extingui&s;hed, but may by the breath of coun&s;el and exhorta|tion be kindled into flame.</P>
<P>TO imagine that every one who is not com|pletely good is irrecoverably abandoned, is to &s;uppo&s;e that all are capable of the &s;ame degrees of excellence; it is indeed to exact, from all, that prefection which none ever can attain. And &s;ince the pure&s;t virtue is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome vice, and the virtue of the greate&s;t number with almo&s;t an equal proportion of contrary qualities, let none too ha&s;tily con|clude that all goodne&s;s is lo&s;t, though it may for a time be clouded and overwhelmed; for mo&s;t minds are the &s;laves of external cir|cum&s;tances, and conform to any hand that undertakes to mould them, roll down any torrent of cu&s;tom in which they happen to
<PB N="293" REF="294">
be caught, or bend to any importunity that bears hard again&s;t them.</P>
<P>IT may be particularly ob&s;erved of women, that they are for the mo&s;t part good or bad, as they fall among tho&s;e who practice vice or virtue; and that neither education nor rea&s;on gives them much &s;ecurity again&s;t the influence of example. Whether it be that thay have le&s;s courage to &s;tand again&s;t oppo&s;ition, or that their de&s;ire of admiration makes them &s;acrifice their principles to the poor plea&s;ure of worthle&s;s prai&s;e, it is certain, whatever be the cau&s;e, that female goodne&s;s &s;eldom keeps its ground again&s;t laughter, flattery, or fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on, every one &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf as entru&s;ted, not only with his own conduct, but with that of others; and as ac|countable, not only for the duties which he neglects, or the crimes that he commits, but for that negligence and irregularity which he may encourage or inculcate. Every man, in whatever &s;tation, has, or endeavours to have his followers, admirers, and imitators; has therefore the influence of his example to watch with care; he ought to avoid not only crimes but the appearance of crimes, and not
<PB N="294" REF="295">
only to practi&s;e virtue, but to applaud, coun|tenance, and &s;upport it. For it is po&s;&s;ible that for want of attention we may teach others faults from which our&s;elves are free, or by a heedle&s;s negligence or cowardly de&s;ertion of a good cau&s;e, which we our&s;elves approve, may alienate tho&s;e who fix their eyes upon us, and who, having no certain rule of their own to guide their cour&s;e in the ocean of the world, are ea&s;ily confounded by the aberrations of that example which they chu&s;e for their direc|tion.</P>
