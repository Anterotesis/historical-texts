<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
SOUTH-SEA
TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>A NEW Trade being now to be &s;et on
Foot, and in a New Manner, with a
Capital Stock, and by the Encourage|ment
of the Government, it has been
long expected when &s;ome Able Pen would have
undertaken to guide the People of this un&s;ettled
Age how to think about it.</P>
<P>There has not been in our Memory an Under|taking
of &s;uch Con&s;equence, and &s;o generally to
be engaged in; nor has there been an Undertaking,
about which the People, even tho&s;e who are to
be concern'd have been &s;o unea&s;ie, their Opini|ons
of it &s;o confu&s;ed, and their Knowledge of the
Manner and Circum&s;tances of it &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>There has not been an Undertaking in this Age
introduced in &s;uch a Method, again&s;t which &s;o
many People, upon &s;o differing Foundations, are
<PB N="6" REF="4">
plea&s;ed (perhaps &s;ome of them hardly knowing
why) to oppo&s;e them&s;elves: Before it was form|ed
it had the general Suffrage of all Mankind,
every Man talk'd of it as a Thing fit to be under|taken,
worthy of the Encouragement of Parlia|ment,
Government, Queen and Nation: The o|mitting
it was tax'd in Print as a Token of Na|tional
Blindne&s;s, and a Want of Judgment in
the Mini&s;try or Managers of all the pa&s;t Years of
this War. The Advantages the <HI>French</HI> made of it
were look't upon as the great Supports of the War
to them, and what encouraged them to carry it on;
and we were reckon'd unaccountably Negligent, in
that we either did not make tho&s;e Advantages our|&s;elves,
or prevent the Enemy from making u&s;e
of them again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Several Publick Printed Pamphlets di&s;po&s;ed to
ridicule the carrying on a War in <HI>Spain,</HI> have
laid down this as the main Point, which the fir&s;t
Contrivers of that War &s;hould have attempted in
the &s;tead of it, and have made a Je&s;t of their Po|liticks
for the Defect; and when the great Quan|tities
of Silver which the <HI>French</HI> Squadrons, and
Private Merchant Ships, have brought Home
from the <HI>South-Seas</HI> have been &s;poken of, it has
been frequently accompanied with Reflections,
and a general Regret, that tho&s;e happy Advan|tages
&s;hould pa&s;s by us&punc; alledging, that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Nation, who are &s;o much better qualified
every Way, both by their Manufactures to Trade
<HI>with,</HI> I&s;lands to Trade <HI>from,</HI> and Naval Strength
to manage and protect that Trade, &s;hould &s;o
long lye &s;till, and leave unattempted, a Trade,
which in the Enemies Hand is &s;o fatal to us, and
which in our Hands might be &s;o fatal to them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">
Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;uch is the evil
Genius of our Times, that now &s;uch an Under|taking
is &s;et on Foot, either it is &s;o ill dige&s;ted,
or the Per&s;ons u&s;hering it into the World are
thought &s;o Di&s;agreeable, or Unskilful, or the Thing
it&s;elf &s;o ill placed in our View, that no Under|taking
of the Kind has met with &s;uch a Fate as
this; and if it mu&s;t go on, it &s;eems throng'd with
Difficulties, calculated to de&s;troy it in its In|fancy.</P>
<P>It is needful therefore with the utmo&s;t Impar|tiality
to enquire into the Ca&s;e, and &s;ee where
the Objections lye; for again&s;t the Trade it&s;elf,
<HI>qua&s;i a Trade to the South-Seas,</HI> no Body will,
or can, rai&s;e any Objection; the Objection mu&s;t
be founded either on
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Method.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Per&s;ons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Time of its Introduction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or again&s;t &s;ome Part of the propo&s;ed Scheme
of carrying on this Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To enquire out this, to weigh duly the Sub|&s;tance
of the Objections, and &s;et the whole in
a true Light, that we may determine whether
this Trade is to be carried on, or no, is the De&s;ign
of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament, which gives the Power
and Limits the Extent of this New Trade, has
given it Birth, and a Name, but has not in the
lea&s;t directed in what Po&s;ture the Per&s;ons to be
concern'd &s;hall put them&s;elves, in what Manner
they &s;hall carry it on, how they &s;hall proceed,
or where they &s;hall begin; nor was it nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="8" REF="6">
that this &s;hould be made any Part of the Founda|tion,
which principally belongs to the Super|&s;tructer:
The Power of an Act of Parliament
was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a Company, to give
them Exclu&s;ive Priviledges, to limit and re&s;train
the&s;e Priviledges, and &s;ettle Bounds between
them and other Trades; but how this Trade is
to be begun, how carried on, where they &s;hall
fix their Footing, from whence to go on pro|gre&s;&s;ively
to the End de&s;ign'd, this is left entirely
to the di&s;po&s;e of the Body, to whom the Power
and Priviledge of &s;uch Trade is deputed.</P>
<P>Now, tho' in the Order of Things we &s;ee no|thing
can be objected again&s;t the Regularity of
this Proceeding, yet this &s;eeming on one Hand
to leave the World in the Dark, as to the Man|ner
of carrying on this Trade, has on the other
Hand filled us with the Crude and Indige&s;ted, or
Ill-dige&s;ted Notions, and Gue&s;&s;es of the Town;
every Man giving his own Opinion in &s;uch a
Manner, that from the Variety of Propo&s;als,
which every one makes, from the Difficulties rai&s;|ed,
and from the Objections brought up again&s;t
the Manner of carrying on this Trade, we are
now brought, by Unhappy Degrees, to all Manner
of Confu&s;ion of Thoughts about it, and from every
Body laying down a Way how to carry it on,
to every Body crowding in their Su&s;picions, their
Sugge&s;tions of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> being Impracticable,
and the <HI>other</HI> too Hazardous; one Way <HI>not</HI> Safe,
another <HI>not</HI> Ju&s;t, a Third <HI>not</HI> Fea&s;ible <HI>and the
like,</HI> as if becau&s;e ye are not at a Certainty
which Way it &s;hall be done, or which is the be&s;t
Way to do it, that therefore it cannot be done
at all.</P>
<P>Whether it be the real Opinion of the&s;e Ob|jectors
<PB N="9" REF="7">
that the Thing is impracticable in it&s;elf,
or whether &s;ome Men, for Rea&s;ons wor&s;e
grounded, think it convenient, if po&s;&s;ible to have
it appear &s;o, is not the pre&s;ent Debate; if the Mi&s;t
may be taken off by cool Rea&s;oning, and People
brought to &s;ee by a clear Light, they will be the
le&s;s influenced by the De&s;ign of any, who may
find it convenient for other Purpo&s;es, that this
Ca&s;e &s;hould be as much perplex'd as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To this End this &s;hort Tract is made Publick,
in which, if the Ca&s;e may be &s;tated clearly, the
fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es, Mi&s;ts and Shadows, with which
this Age is amu&s;ed, taken away, and the Preju|dices
of People on either Hand removed, per|haps
we may come to a right Under&s;tanding of
the Ca&s;e: Having premi&s;ed this by Way of In|troduction,
it &s;eems naturally to lead the Reader
to a View of the Doubts, now &s;tarted among us
about this Trade.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether this Trade to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> can
be carried on, or no?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether the Manner of propo&s;ing this
Trade be Rational and Ju&s;t?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It &s;eems indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to enquire into
the&s;e Things fir&s;t, before we meddle with the
Manner how it is to be carried on, &s;ince the Ob|jections
that &s;eem mo&s;t to perplex the Town
now, <HI>whether by De&s;ign or no,</HI> are laid again&s;t the
Thing in general, that it will come to Nothing
that it is a Chimera, a Sham, has Nothing, in it, is
Impracticable, will be Dropt again, was taken
up to &s;erve a Turn, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>The Allegations to &s;u&s;tain this are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">
1. They &s;ay the Scheme is Impracticable; that
you propo&s;e a Thing not to be done; impo&s;&s;ible
in the general Notions of Trade; that this was
not a Sea&s;on for it; that the Countries you pro|po&s;e
to Trade with are in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> our declar'd Enemies;
that 'tis Time enough to talk of Trading thither
when you have &s;ome of the Country in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on;
that Conquering Nations is a Work which
do's not belong to Merchants and Companies,
who&s;e Stock will be exhau&s;ted by any Attempt of
that Kind; that to talk of Trade before Conque&s;t,
and Conque&s;t before any Attempt made, are
equally ridiculous.</P>
<P>2. That when any Part of this Country may
be taken from the Enemy and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, it ought
to be proved that the Enemy &s;hall not be in any
Manner able to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s you again, to attack or
mole&s;t you; in which Ca&s;e Commerce and Trade
will not only be interrupted, but entirely di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>3. That neither of the Nations who po&s;&s;e&s;s
<HI>South America, viz.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> will
ever Capitulate with you, or upon any Terms,
whether in Peace or War, con&s;ent to a Free Trade,
and therefore it cannot be expected that the Scheme
as it is propo&s;ed can an&s;wer the Ends of Trade.</P>
<P>4. That it's evident the Affair of Trade was
not the main End of the Propo&s;al, but other Aims
are couch'd under this Pretence, which other
Aims are not plea&s;ing to the Parties concern'd,
and therefore were glo&s;&s;ed over with this pretend|ed
Advantage, to make them pa&s;s the more ea&s;ily
and undi&s;covered with the People; but that the
Pretence being equally liable to Objection, as
the Thing de&s;ign'd, &s;o both together render the
<PB N="11" REF="9">
Minds of the People more unea&s;ie than they were
before.</P>
<P>The Second Que&s;tion lies again&s;t the Manner
of propo&s;ing this Trade, which they &s;ay is violent
and unu&s;ual, a <HI>Force</HI> upon the People again&s;t
their Will, incon&s;i&s;tent with their Liberty, and
that therefore it is entred upon with a general
Di&s;&s;atisfaction, curs'd by them that are to go in|to
it, hated by tho&s;e that refu&s;e it, and ridicul'd
by all; that it is a meer Project of a Party, a Con|trivance
to &s;erve the Turn they are carrying on
by it, and to put a Face of Payment upon a Debt
which they know not what to do with, and which
made them unea&s;ie; and all this without a Reality,
that they might &s;tifle the Clamour of tho&s;e who&s;e
ju&s;t Demands upon the Government could no o|therwi&s;e
be an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>If the Objectors have not full Scope given them
here in relating their Objections, it is only becau&s;e
the Reproaches and Reflections which they &s;tudy
to &s;et them off with, and which they very plen|tifully
be&s;tow upon the Government, and upon
the Per&s;ons who they think are the In&s;truments of
it, are left out, as Things which &s;eem not to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
at all, either to make their Argument more
forcible, or add to the Number of Rea&s;ons; and
this Omi&s;&s;ion 'tis hoped they will excu&s;e in an Au|thor
who is not writing to reproach any Side, but
to calm and quiet the Minds of every Side, and
bring Things, if po&s;&s;ible, to a clear and right Un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The
Reader will pardon the Breach of Order, if
in &s;peaking to the Objections the latter come fir&s;t
in Cour&s;e; becau&s;e, as they lye rather again&s;t the
Part already acted Introductory to the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, rather than again&s;t the Part that &s;hall after|wards
<PB N="12" REF="10">
be acted, they &s;eem to demand to be fir&s;t
&s;poken to.</P>
<P>In Order to this it may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary a little Hi|&s;torically
to enter into the Steps taken on every
Hand to introduce this Affair into the World, and
this without excu&s;ing or accu&s;ing one Side or other,
may be &s;ufficient to give a right View of the Thing,
and re&s;tore People to their Temper in judging
about it.</P>
<P>In the Con&s;ultations which of Cour&s;e employ
the Heads of the Mini&s;ters of State every Year
about the Time of the Sitting of the Parliament,
the&s;e Three Things generally are the chief.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How and Where to carry on the War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How to pay Debts and &s;upport Credit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. How to rai&s;e Money.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>When the&s;e Things in their Ordinary Cour&s;e
came to be debated the la&s;t Parliament, Two
Things with a more than ordinary Weight &s;eem'd
to pre&s;s upon the Publick.</P>
<P>1. A Va&s;t Debt, which, whether by the Mi&s;conduct
of the former Managers, or by the Nece&s;&s;ity of the
Publick Affairs, is not to the Purpo&s;e here, was lying
upon the Nation in the &s;everal Offices of the Navy,
Victualling, Ordnance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with other
Deficiencies, amounting to &s;everal Millions, which
as Ju&s;tice on one Hand called loudly upon them
to make good, &s;o on the other Hand the Publick
Credit was touch'd by it; and if &s;ome Provi&s;ion
was not made for it, there was Rea&s;on to fear
Parliamentary Credit would receive a Blow which
would not be ea&s;ie to recover; and which might
be fatal to all the Schemes and Propo&s;als for
Funds and Loans which might follow, &s;ince the
<PB N="13" REF="11">
People who had tru&s;ted the Government with &s;uch
Great Sums of Money would too much influence
the future Lending and Lenders of Money, if
no Care was taken to make Payment to them,
who&s;e Debts were &s;o Ju&s;t as well as &s;o Great.</P>
<P>2. The Second Weight was, the long omitted
Article of attacking the Enemy in that mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
Part, from whence they deriv'd &s;o eminently
their Chief Support, and from whence the Si|news
of War (<HI>viz.</HI> Their Money) were con&s;tantly
Supplied to them, I mean their Colonies in <HI>America;</HI>
the Omi&s;&s;ion of which &s;eem'd a mo&s;t unaccounta|ble
Neglect in former Times, and Per&s;ons, and the
Attempting which &s;eem'd &s;o inviting at this Time
on Two Accounts. Fir&s;t, as it would interrupt
the Advantageous Commerce of the Enemy: And
Secondly, As it would open a Door of Trade to
our People, which they never yet had Opportuni|ty
to meddle with, and this Occa&s;ion being lo&s;t
we were not to hope for another.</P>
<P><HI>Note, <HI>This la&s;t Notion is founded on the Trea|ty
of the General Confederacy, call'd more com|monly
the Grand Alliance, wherein by the 6th
Article it is &s;tipulated,&mdash;That,</HI></HI> It &s;hall be
Lawful for His Royal Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI>
and the Lords, the States-General,
by Common Advice, and for the Benefit and
Enlargement of the Davigation and Com|merce
of their Subjects, to &s;eize by their
Forces what Land and Cities they can be|longing
to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion in the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
and what&s;oever they &s;hall &s;o take, &s;hall
be their own. <HI>Vid. <HI>the Treaty of the Grand Al|liance,
p.</HI></HI> 68.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> This is the Occa&s;ion, which, as above, it is
humbly pre&s;umed may never happen again, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">herefore was not now to be Omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">
The&s;e Two material Articles coming into Con|&s;ideration
at the &s;ame Time, it came into the
Heads of &s;ome, who&s;e Thoughts were more e&s;pe|cially
Intent upon applying proper Remedies to
both the&s;e Maladies,&mdash;That perhaps &s;ome
Method might be found out to Cure them both
with One Plai&s;ter, or as we &s;ay more vulgarly,
Kill both the&s;e Birds with One Stone. To ex|explain
it more fully.&mdash;A Scheme is formed,
wherein it is &s;ugge&s;ted, that bringing both Ca&s;es
together, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Debt which was to be paid,
and the attacking the Enemy in <HI>America,</HI> which
was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, One might be &s;o
made a&s;&s;i&s;ting and concurring to and with the O|ther,
that Both might be with the more Ea&s;e
effected and brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>In examining nicely the State of the&s;e &s;eve|ral
Ca&s;es, it appear'd, they were naturally to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
divided into Two Heads of Propo&s;als, contain'd
in the following Abridgement.</P>
<P>1. The Payment of the Debt,&mdash;and this re|quir'd

2. The Planting our own People in tho&s;e Rich
Climates, where, by laying a Foundation of Trade
which was never yet ingaged in, Our Subjects
might come to be enric'd, and made full amends
for the Lo&s;s of their <HI>Spani&s;h Trade;</HI> and al&s;o the
Channel of Silver which has hitherto flowed
with &s;o full a Stream into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to
the Support of our Enemies, might be turn'd,
and might with the &s;ame Fullne&s;s and Freedom
empty it&s;elf among our Merchants; and farther,
the Settlements to be made there might be &s;o ma|ny
Magazines of Wealth to us and our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>It is Unhappy that a De&s;ign big with &s;o many
Advantages has met with this Misfortune, that
the joining together the&s;e Two, tho' great and
ju&s;t Pro&s;pects, has been ca&s;ually and eventually
the Ruin of both; not that we grant them yet
ruined, but that the Difficulties &s;tarted, and the
Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es among us rais'd at the Beginning, are
the Cau&s;es of ruinous Quarrels, Breaches and Cla|mours
about it, which it is mo&s;t ea&s;ie to prove are
founded upon the want of a right Under&s;tanding
and Di&s;tingui&s;hing the Ca&s;e; by which al&s;o if
perhaps in the contriving and joining the&s;e great
Events together any Mi&s;take has been made, it
might with Ea&s;e come to be rectified, without
gratifying tho&s;e who &s;eem glad of private Mi|&s;takes,
in order to pu&s;h on the greater Mi&s;take,
<HI>viz.</HI> The De&s;ign of rendring the Whole abortive
and ineffectual.</P>
<P>To Di&s;tingui&s;h therefore rightly of this Mat|ter,
and thereby come to a Clear Under&s;tanding
in it, we ought to debate it Two Ways.</P>
<P>1. In its &s;eparate pre-exi&s;tent State, as a Debt,
and as a Trade re&s;pectively.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">
2. In the <HI>now</HI> Conjoined Circum&s;tance, as blend|ed
together, whereby the Debt and the Trade is
call'd, tho' wrong and erroneou&s;ly, One <HI>South-Sea
Stock.</HI></P>
<P>In its Separate or Pre-exi&s;tent State, we find,
as before, Two Things upon the Wheel; or to
&s;peak more plain, the Mini&s;try had Two Things
upon their Hands, either of them nece&s;&s;ary to be
done, and both having their re&s;pective Difficulties
in the Management.</P>
<P>1. The Debt of the Navy, Ordnance, Victual|ling,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is no Part of this Work to enquire
how the Government came to be embarra&s;s'd
with &s;o great a Debt unprovided for; whether
the concealing it from the Nation &s;o long, or the
very being a Debt, may be laid to any Man's Door,
or no, is not the Ca&s;e here: Perhaps the Wri|ter
of the&s;e Sheets differs &s;omething from every
Side in his Opinion, and may re&s;erve that Opi|nion
to defend tho&s;e who may be defended, and
charge tho&s;e who may be charged, at another
Time; at pre&s;ent it is of no Signification to the
Point in Hand, and is therefore much better let
alone than meddled with.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of the Debt is evident; the Act for
making Provi&s;ion for it has &s;et it forth at large;
there remain'd due and owing great Sums, for
which there &s;eem'd to be no Parliamentary Provi|&s;ion
made, other than the Credit of the Publick;
and which there &s;eem'd to be an ab&s;olute Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
to make &s;ome pre&s;ent Provi&s;ion for, both
as it re&s;pected the People concern'd, who were
in Di&s;tre&s;s for their Money, and as it re&s;pected
the Publick Credit, which began to &s;uffer by the
high Di&s;counts allow'd on Sale of the&s;e Debts.</P>

<P>Not reckoning into this Account the Principal

Whole Sum from the 25th of <HI>March</HI> to the 25th
of <HI>December,</HI> 1711, being Nine Months, both
which Sums amount to One Million Seven Hun|dred
Fifty-&s;even Thou&s;and Seven Hundred Fifty-three
Pound Nine Shillings One Peny more.</P>
<P>This is the Account as by the Act of Parlia|ment
for &s;ettling this Matter it is ca&s;t up; a va&s;t
Debt.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">
A Va&s;t Debt to be clear'd in One Se&s;&s;ion of Par|liament,
and that in a Se&s;&s;ion too, in which &s;o
great a Sum for the ordinary Service of the com|ing
Year was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be given,
and was given accordingly, amounting to
above Six Millions Sterling, &s;o that Inclu|&s;ive
of the Sum above Voted to be provided for,
this Parliament were oblig'd to rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum as
never was heard of in the World, and &s;uch a Sum
as when talk'd of in Foreign Countries in the Dia|lect
of their Finances will make &s;uch a Sound as
mu&s;t amaze the World, and make them conclude,
That a Nation which can rai&s;e &s;uch Sums can ne|ver
be &s;ubdued for Want of Money; let any Man
but think of Fourteen Millions Sterling to be
rais'd in One Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, making in
<HI>Spain</HI> Seven and Forty Millions of Pieces of
Eight, or in <HI>French</HI> Livres, or <HI>German</HI> Florins,
above One Hundred and Sixty-four Millions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things are not hinted to enlarge the
Sound of Words; but the Sum being really thus
great, which was of Nece&s;&s;ity to be rais'd &s;eems
to argue very &s;trongly with tho&s;e Gentlemen,
who being Creditors to the Government in the
Articles above, &s;eem to quarrel the Manner of their

they ought to have been paid in Money, tho'
with Time; that they &s;hould have been left
to Payments in Cour&s;e, and that they had Inte|re&s;t
running on their Bills, and were better be|fore
than now.</P>
<P>Where I an utter Enemy to the very Name and
Per&s;ons of the Pre&s;ent Managers of Publick Affairs;
were I bent to quarrel at all they did, becau&s;e they
did it; were I to &s;et apart a Pen dipt in Gall to a|&s;per&s;e
and reproach every Action of their Mini&s;try,
<PB N="19" REF="17">
and re&s;olv'd as far as in me lay to be a general
Evil Genius, to bla&s;t and &s;candalize Things for the
Sake of Men, Men for the Sake of Parties,
and Parties for the Sake of Prejudice, a Practice
too much the Mode among us for &s;ome Years
pa&s;t; were this Paper, I &s;ay, directed by &s;uch a
Spirit as this, yet I could not find any Room in
this Part of the Affair to rai&s;e the lea&s;t Objection;
for I cannot &s;ee, &s;peaking with the utmo&s;t Impar|tiality,
that in the Circum&s;tances of Publick Af|fairs
as they then &s;tood, the Parliament could
do any Thing <HI>Le&s;s</HI> or <HI>More</HI> than they did.</P>
<P>1. They could not do <HI>Le&s;s</HI> than take &s;ome
Care to bring the Debt to &s;ome Point of Certainty.</P>
<P>The Demand was Great and Loud; the Sum
was branch'd out into Multitudes of Hands, and
tho&s;e Hands &s;uch as being the Trading Sort of
People, could not <HI>the be&s;t of any</HI> be without their
Money; this was attended with &s;everal intolera|ble
Evils.</P>
<P>1. It cau&s;ed the Poor People to run to the Stock-jobbers,
to the Man-eating Di&s;counters, and Money-lending
Extortioners, either to pledge or &s;ell their
Bills; and the Payments in Cour&s;e appearing
every Day more and more Remote and Uncer|tain,
tho&s;e <HI>Cannibals,</HI> for in &s;ome Sence they are
&s;uch, made every Day their Advantage of it to
prey upon the Nece&s;&s;itous and Indigent People,
till the Di&s;count of the&s;e Bills came to near 40
<HI>per Cent.</HI> and the Tickets of Poor Sailors to a|bove
50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Di&s;count, if Sold; and Loans
upon them were wor&s;e, they being not to be had
under 10 to 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, which in a
few Years would &s;wallow up the whole Debt,
Principal and Intere&s;t, as is plain without putting
<PB N="20" REF="18">
the Reader to the Trouble to run over Tables of
Calculation.</P>
<P>2. This every Day &s;unk the Credit of the Na|vy,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that the Rates of every thing ri&s;ing in
Proportion to the Di&s;count of their Bills, would
&s;oon have brought the Queen's Affairs to the &s;ame
or a wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Po&s;ture than his late Maje&s;ty King
<HI>William</HI> &s;truggled with when the Sum given by
Parliament, thro' the Extravagance of Di&s;count,
Prices of Goods, and Deficiences of Funds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were generally to be accounted in real Aid of the
Publick Service to be not above One Third of
what they were called in the Votes of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being before them, it is left to
any one to con&s;ider, whether the Parliament only
giving Money for the ordinary Service of the
Navy, Victualling, Ordnance, Tran&s;port&punc; <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
every Year, and &s;o leaving Payments to be made
in Cour&s;e, had been either Prudent or Practicable,
&s;ince every Year the ordinary Service brought us in
Debt farther than the Sums demanded by Acci|dents
unfore&s;een, and impo&s;&s;ible to be provided for.</P>
<P>There might be much more &s;aid, but it is left
to the mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied rational Man in the Na|tion
to &s;ay, whether to have left the Ca&s;e to Pay|ments
in Cour&s;e, as above, had been any Thing el&s;e
than ju&s;t a putting off the Evil Day, and leaving
the Debt as a growing Di&s;ea&s;e, which may at pre|&s;ent
be borne with, but will at la&s;t infallibly prove
mortal, bring a &s;low, but certain, Death upon the
Body&punc; encrea&s;ing every Day till at la&s;t it &s;hould
have been &s;o great, that they could never have
paid it at all. This I take to be the True, Im|partial
State of the Ca&s;e at that Time, and there|fore
I &s;ay the Parliament could not have done <HI>Le&s;s</HI>
than they did, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to bring the Debt to a Point:
<PB N="21" REF="19">
fix the Sum; e&s;tabli&s;h a Fund of Intere&s;t for the
Payment and Annual Di&s;charge of the Increa&s;e, that
they might know what they were in Debt, and
might hereafter take a convenient Occa&s;ion, as the
Publick Affairs would permit, to di&s;charge the
Whole.</P>
<P>To ha' paid neither Principal nor Intere&s;t
mu&s;t at la&s;t have made the Debt intolerably
Great, reduc'd the Creditor to un&s;ufferable
Hard&s;hips, and in Time the Di&s;count of tho&s;e
Bills would have run at 70 and 80 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and
the Offices would ha' been able to have bought
no Stores or Provi&s;ions at all, but what they mu&s;t
have advanc'd ready Money for, which ready
Money either they would not have to pay, or the
Payments in Cour&s;e mu&s;t entirely &s;top.</P>
<P>Let any Man judge this with Impartiality, and
cen&s;ure it if they can; I mu&s;t own I do not &s;ee
what the Parliament could do <HI>Le&s;s</HI> than they did
in the Ca&s;e of the Debt, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to put it upon a
Fund for the Payment of the Intere&s;t, till Provi&s;i|on
may be made for the Principal, which Principal
it is evident they were not in a Condition to make
a pre&s;ent Provi&s;ion for; and this leads me to the
Second Head, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>2. That I do not &s;ee what they could do <HI>More.</HI>
There are but Two Articles in the Ca&s;e of a Debt.
1. Payment of Principal. 2. Payment of Inte|re&s;t.&mdash;If
the fir&s;t cannot be done, the la&s;t mu&s;t;
this is only a Con&s;ideration for the Party's &s;tay|ing
till the other can be done. No Man tho' he
cannot pay a Debt can be call'd a Bankrupt, if he
offers Security, and pay the Intere&s;t; it is no
Reproach to the Nation or the Government to &s;ay
they cannot pay this Great Principal Debt, at lea&s;t
Now; but you are offer'd in the Nation's Behalf
<PB N="22" REF="20">
the Payment of Intere&s;t, and that Intere&s;t conti|nued
till the Principal be paid: So that in the
Common Cour&s;e and the Nature of Things the Na|tion
is no Way to be term'd Bankrupt; the Debt
is &s;ecured, and were there not &s;omething el&s;e
in it, this Payment would have been allowed to
be very good; for why &s;hould we tread on one a|nother's
Heels to purcha&s;e Annuities of Intere&s;t
at but Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> and pay our ready Money
with &s;uch Eagerne&s;s for them; and yet refu&s;e the
&s;ame Intere&s;t for a Debt which we would before
have &s;old for 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Di&s;count, or perhaps
had bought with that Allowance. This is a mo&s;t
unaccountable Paradox, and to con&s;ider the Debt
in its &s;eparate Capacity it is really &s;omething My|&s;terious
on other Accounts, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I might add here al&s;o to encrea&s;e the Wonder
that the Settlement allows the pa&s;t Intere&s;t to be
ca&s;t up, and to be added to the Principal, and
the running Intere&s;t for the Future to be paid
upon the Whole; &s;o that the Creditor turns U&s;u|rer
upon the Government, and receives Intere&s;t
upon Intere&s;t, which he had no Title to before;
and which I mention, becau&s;e it will occur again
to be &s;poken of, as being a full Equivalent to all
that Advance, which can be recalled out of his
Hands for the Stock of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company,
of which by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>(2.) This brings us to the Con&s;ideration of
this Affair in its Complex Po&s;ture, in its Con|join'd
Circum&s;tances; (<HI>viz.</HI>) as the Payment of
this Debt is blended together with a Thing Fo|reign,
<HI>&s;ay &s;ome,</HI> in its Nature Exotic, and remote to
the Notions and Under&s;tandings of the Generality
of the People particularly concern'd in this
Debt; out of their Way, foreign to their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="23" REF="21">
and con&s;equently Di&s;agreeable and Un&s;a|tisfying.</P>
<P>The
Mini&s;try, <HI>if I may venture to &s;ay &s;o,</HI> I be|lieve
had quite other Notions of this Part of the
Ca&s;e, and annexed this Article to the other as an
Additional Con&s;ideration to the Debt afore&s;aid,
expecting no doubt that the Exclu&s;ive Pri|viledge
of a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> &s;hould be
receiv'd with a particular Satisfaction, &s;hould be
valued at &s;omething in the Rate of their Debt, and
&s;hould have made the Sub&s;cription more worth to
tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;cribed; that it was given in as an
Encouragement to all People who &s;hould hereaf|ter
Tru&s;t the Government; that in Con&s;ideration
of their having been kept out of their Money,
the&s;e Things were thrown in, both to gratifie and
oblige them. (1.) The turning their pa&s;t Intere&s;t
into Principal, and, (2.) The giving them an Exclu|&s;ive
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> a Trade &s;o improved
in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;o capable to
be improved in ours.</P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, &s;peaking without the lea&s;t
Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, the Projectors who contri|ved,
the Government or Mini&s;try who managed,
nay, the very Parliament who granted this Act,
under&s;tood this Ca&s;e in &s;ome Mea&s;ure as I have
put it, and the Rea&s;ons are the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. Becau&s;e really in the Nature of the Thing,
ab&s;tracted from Prejudice and Party, it &s;eems that it
is certainly &s;o. How infinitely then does the Plague
of Parties influence all our Affairs! And how
does it change the very Nature and Con&s;equence
of Things!</P>
<P>2. Becau&s;e, had they not conceived thus of
it, they would never have tack'd it to a
<PB N="24" REF="22">
Thing of this Value and Con&s;equence, &s;ince I
believe it will be readily granted, that either of
the&s;e Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the &s;ettling a Fund of Inte|re&s;t
for the Debt, and the erecting a Publick
Company for a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> would
have been leap'd at apart by every one concern'd in
the fir&s;t, or capable of venturing in the la&s;t; and
I think I do not &s;peak without Book in either
of the&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire, why that, which in a
&s;eperate Con&s;ideration is &s;o clear, and without
exception, &s;hould fall under &s;uch a general Di&s;|like
when brought together; that there are &s;ome
Rea&s;ons to be a&s;&s;ign'd, which are Invidious,
Per&s;onal, and which the Author of this cares not
to mention, is a Thing rather to be &s;igh'd for than
di&s;puted; but &s;ome Rea&s;ons other than the&s;e may
be hinted at.</P>
<P>1. The &s;eeming Force there is in the Act, to
make the&s;e the Company, and none el&s;e, and
to oblige the&s;e to be the People.</P>
<P>2. The unhappy &s;orting of the People, in the
Con&s;equence of the Act, putting them up|on
the Trade, who are neither qualified by Cir|cum&s;tances
or Genius to it, and who by their
Ignorance have brought them&s;elves to di&s;like
it, even becau&s;e they do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e I take to be Misfortunes to the Pro|po&s;ers
of this Affair; and yet both are Things,
which, 1. They could not ea&s;ily fore&s;ee. And,
2. Fore&s;eeing they could not ea&s;ily prevent,
without putting all upon a Hazard.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="23">
1. They could not ea&s;ily <HI>fore&s;ee</HI> it; for who
could have imagin'd that a Thing &s;o generally
applauded before, which we had been blam'd &s;o
often and &s;o publickly for neglecting, which our
Enemies the <HI>French</HI> have made &s;uch Infinite Ad|vantage
of, &s;hould not be e&s;teem'd an Advantage
to us? <HI>Or that,</HI> to oblige them all to an equal
and proportion'd Sub&s;cription would be taken as
an Impo&s;ition? I mu&s;t own I'm again&s;t all
Manner of Force, and think it had been better
here left more to Choice; <HI>But how better?</HI> I do
not mean better for the <HI>People,</HI> but better for
the <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> that their Work had been ea&s;ier,
and the Popular Clamour le&s;s without it; for
the Advantage propo&s;ed is to the People, not to
the Mini&s;try; and the Force then is no more than
as you would have forc'd a Child or a Lunatick
out of a Hou&s;e that was on Fire; and I ra|ther
put it thus upon a Suppo&s;ition, that there
is &s;ome Con&s;traint, than argue, tho' the Ca&s;e
might hear it, &s;trictly &s;peaking, that really here
is no Force at all.</P>
<P>2. But &s;uppo&s;e the Mini&s;try had fore&s;een that
the Notion of a Force, how much &s;oever to our
Advantage, is &s;o Irk&s;ome a Thing, that it would
hazard the bringing the Propo&s;al into a general
Di&s;like. Since Liberty is &s;o Nice a Thing that
it &s;hould not be touch'd upon, tho' it was never
&s;o much to the Advantage of the Per&s;on;
yet I own I do not &s;ee how they could go
forward (<HI>viz.</HI>) in joining the Two Propo&s;als,
and leave the Thing more to Choice, than they
have done.</P>
<P>Liberty is an Invaluable Priviledge, and no
Man can in his right Under&s;tanding be ea&s;ily a|ble
to be too careful of it.&mdash;I remember a Story
<PB N="26" REF="24">
of Two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers in <HI>Catalonia</HI> this very
War.&mdash;The General finding that the Liberty our
People took in eating Grapes, and other Lu&s;cious
Fruits in tho&s;e hot Countries, was very de&s;tructive
to the Health of the Men, that it threw them into
Fluxes and Fevers, and de&s;troyed great Numbers
of them, made an Order that none of the Men
under great Penalty &s;hould eat any Grapes.&mdash;Two
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers had tran&s;gre&s;s'd the Order,
and carried the Puni&s;hment along with the Crime,
for they fell into a Flux, and were dangerou&s;ly
III.&mdash;The Officer order'd them to be brought
before him, in Order to puni&s;h them: One of
the Men an&s;wer'd, <Q REND="inline">'The General may e'en let us
alone, for we &s;hall not trouble him long. How|ever,
Sick as they were, Orders in the Army
mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, and they were brought before
him, <HI>for go they could not.</HI> The Officer ask'd
them how they dur&s;t eat Grapes when they knew
the Order&punc; the Fellow boldly told him, <HI>That in
all his Orders as to the Service they had obeyed
punctually, and never tran&s;gre&s;t; but in this, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
what concern'd them&s;elves only, they were</HI> Engli&s;h
men <HI>and</HI> Freemen, <HI>and thought they ought to be at</HI>
LIBERTY <HI>to Kill them&s;elves whenever they
had a Mind to it.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Indeed upon the&s;e Nice Principles of Liberty
here may be &s;ome Force alledged, but in the main
it cannot be &s;o properly called <HI>Force;</HI> becau&s;e e|very
Man that does not think fit to come in may
remain in the State he was before; nor do I think
that State is or can be made <HI>Wor&s;e</HI> than before
becau&s;e other Provi&s;ion than a Parliamentary
Fund of Intere&s;t could never be made, or be ex|pected
to be made; and if I judge right of the
Additional Article, which they call the <HI>South-Sea
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Stock,</HI> which is reckon'd an Incumbrance, it &s;tands
upon this Foot, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it takes nothing from
the Sub&s;cription which it does not fir&s;t add to it;
becau&s;e the Intere&s;t which is paid by this Sub|&s;cription
upon the Arrear of Intere&s;t allowed to
be added to the Principal, amounts in Time to
much more than the 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which is to be
called in by the Company to form the Stock for
Carrying on the Trade.</P>
<P>Perhaps this has not been much thought of by
tho&s;e who complain of the Hard&s;hips that this
Trade is to them; and this may be farther improved
by &s;uch who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to defend the Propo&s;al
in General: The&s;e Sheets are not prepared to defend
one Side again&s;t another, but as far as is po&s;&s;ible
to &s;et the Matter in a clear Light between both,
that they may &s;ee for them&s;elves what it is pro|per
to do or &s;ay in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems very unhappy to this Nation that &s;uch
Unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;uch Strife, and Clamour, and
Party-making, &s;hould be among us, about not
the Things them&s;elves, but the meer joining them
together, &s;ince, as it is noted before, take them
a&s;under, and I make no Doubt but we &s;hould be
very ready to embrace them both: I explain my
&s;elf thus.</P>
<P>I cannot think but that all the Per&s;ons
concern'd in the Debt upon the Navy, Tran&s;port,
Victualling, Ordnance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who&s;e Debt was in
the Po&s;ture and Condition as was before ob&s;er|ved,
would have been very well contented and
&s;atisfied with an Act of Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hing a
Fund of Perpetual Intere&s;t at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their
Debt till the Principal &s;hall be paid, and would
have taken it as a very great Advantage to have
the Arrear of Intere&s;t added to the Principal
<PB N="28" REF="26">
Debt; had the Act gone no farther than this, I
firmly believe every one had been fully &s;atisfied
and thankful: My Rea&s;ons for it are the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Why &s;hould we not think &s;o</HI> when we reflect
on the precarious Condition of tho&s;e Debts be|fore?
(1.) How impo&s;&s;ible to be paid in ma|ny
Ages by the Cour&s;e of the Navy? (2.) How
certain to encrea&s;e every Year by the &s;ame Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
that brought 'em to the Height they were
at.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Why &s;hould we not think &s;o</HI> when we reflect
how well content People were with the like Me|thod?
Tho' with but 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t in for|mer
Ca&s;es, as in that of the Orphans Debts in

&s;oliciting for the &s;ame Grace, in either of which
Ca&s;es the Debt was not le&s;s Ju&s;t, or more unlike|ly
to be &s;ome Time or other paid than this: But
if the&s;e are thought remote In&s;tances, there are
other nearer our View which I need not name&punc;
Let &s;uch as que&s;tion this look back to our Old

this, &s;o eagerly purcha&s;ed with ready Money, &s;o
ea&s;ily filled before the very Signing of the Act,
and bought afterwards at the Advance of a Year's
and a Year and half's Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons why I think
had this Fund of Intere&s;t &s;tood by it&s;elf as a Se|curity
for the Payment of this Debt, adding the
Arrear of Intere&s;t to the Principal Debt, and turn|ing
the Whole into an Annuity of 32 Years at
6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> with the Principal Money to be then
repaid, nay, tho' the Principal Money had been
then to &s;ink, it would gladly have been accepted.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;ee the Misfortune of our Divi&s;i|ons
and Breaches among our&s;elves which occa&s;i|ons
all this Murmur.&mdash;The Annexing to this
Fund of Intere&s;t, the Priviledge of this Trade to
the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> to be carried on by a Stock
to be rai&s;ed upon 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> only of this
Debt; and even this 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> obtain'd in the
Sub&s;cription over and above the Debt by giving
an Intere&s;t upon the Arrear of Intere&s;t in the
Debt. This is the Fly in the Sweet Ointment of
the Apothecary, which cau&s;es it, however heal|ing
in it&s;elf, to &s;end forth a &s;tinking Savour.</P>
<P>Now it would be enquired here why this was
added by the Government? Was it for &s;ome Gain
the Mini&s;try were to make of it? Or, Was it
given in as a &s;uppo&s;ed Advantage to the Sub&s;cri|bers,
to encourage them, and to make amends, for
the Lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain'd by being out of their Mo|ney.</P>
<P>As
to any Advantage to the Government by
granting the Priviledge of a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI>
and erecting a Company for that Purpo&s;e,
<PB N="30" REF="28">
I &s;hall give full Space for any one that can to
&s;et tho&s;e Advantages down: I profe&s;s my&s;elf ig|norant
of any real Advantage made by it, no, not
One Farthing to the Government, or to the Mi|ni&s;try,
either Publick or Private:&mdash;If there is
any &s;uppo&s;ed Advantage in the putting that Part
of the Stock which remains in the Trea&s;ury in|to
a Form, &s;o as it may be pa&s;&s;ed in
Payment, <HI>&amp;c. as it now is;</HI> I an&s;wer, this is
no Advantage at all, becau&s;e the &s;ame
would have been made in the Annuities or
Funds of Intere&s;t without it, and perhaps more
to the Satisfaction of the Receiver, as well as
to the Credit of the Payer; and therefore this
cannot be placed to the Account of the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, or brought as a Rea&s;on why the Govern|ment
joined it to the Intere&s;t of the Debt: Nor
indeed upon the &s;tricte&s;t Examination can I find
that ever any Advantage was pretended either by
the Mini&s;try in propo&s;ing it, or charg'd upon them
by the Objectors to it; but that truly and <HI>bona
fide</HI> the Mini&s;try propo&s;ed this meerly as an
Advantage to the Sub&s;cribers; as an Encourage|ment
to the People concern'd, and as a Means
to promote a Trade which might be in the End
&s;o glorious to the Nation, &s;o profitable to the
Parties concern'd, and &s;o manife&s;t a Foundation
of the Increa&s;e of Wealth and Commerce to the
Whole. If there are any other Clau&s;es of Advan|tage
to the Government than the&s;e, I mu&s;t own
they are laid out of my Sight; nor I believe can
the greate&s;t Enemies of the pre&s;ent Project find
them out, at lea&s;t I have never heard them a&s;|&s;ign'd,
and &s;hall &s;ay more to it when I do.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">
<HI>On the other Hand,</HI> had the Mini&s;try propo&s;ed
&s;uch a Trade by it&s;elf; had Books been laid open
in the City for a Voluntary Sub&s;cription of a
Stock to carry it on; had the Adventure been
propo&s;ed with the Favour, and under the Pro|tection,
of the Government, with all its Hazards,
with all its &s;uppo&s;ed Impracticable Parts; had
the Priviledges and Limitations of the pre&s;ent
Act been offered, What think you, <HI>Gentlemen
Objectors?</HI> Will you &s;peak your Thoughts Im|partially,
without Party Prejudice, under this
Mini&s;try, or any Mini&s;try? Would it ha' been
rejected? Would not any Sum ha' been &s;ub&s;cri|bed?
Would Adventurers ha' been found, or no?
I am per&s;waded no Man will &s;ay it would ha'
failed; no Man can doubt it, if they will con&s;i|der
the forward Humour of the Age in New Ad|ventures;
or the long Interruption of Trade by
the War, which has left the Merchants of this
City and Nation le&s;s Room to extend their Com|merce
than formerly; if they con&s;ider the Flu&s;h
Stocks which our Trading People are furni&s;hed
with, and their Readine&s;s to launch out, where
there are probable Advantages: The&s;e Things
con&s;idered, there can be no doubt but &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al
&s;tanding by it&s;elf had been very well re|li&s;hed
by the Generality of our People; nay, I
will not &s;ay but they would have purcha&s;ed the
Priviledges and Protection, now &s;lighted, with
the Advance of Money, as was done in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Trade, and has been offered in others.
Nor am I alone, I believe, in my Opinion.</P>
<P>But have we not &s;omething then Peculiar in
the Fate of this Nation, which an indifferent
<PB N="32" REF="30">
Man mu&s;t needs lament, that the Surface of Af|fairs
can &s;o much alter our Temper, and that our
Judgments are &s;o over rul'd by our Prejudices,
that we cannot approve of that join'd together,
which we would &s;o freely embrace if offered a|part?
I am not writing Satyrs here, nor plead|ing
for a Party, if I were I &s;hould take &s;ome
Freedom on both Sides; I &s;hould perhaps re|proach
tho&s;e People who will reject Publick Ad|vantages
for the Sake of Private Prejudices; and
becau&s;e they cannot go along with the Publick in
all their Proceedings, will not therefore go along
with them in tho&s;e wherein the general Good
is evidently carried on.&mdash;I &s;hould, on the other
Hand, perhaps &s;ay, that the joining the&s;e Two
Unhappy Happy Thoughts together was no To|ken
of making a right Judgment of the Temper
of our Times, and the only Cau&s;e of the
Di&s;order that has happened among us upon this
Head.</P>
<P>Unhappy Conjunction! That Two Good
Things &s;hould make One Bad One; Two Things
equally Happy a&s;under, Advantageous, Plea&s;ing
and Profitable, apart, but put together plea&s;es every
Body the le&s;s, and hardly and Body &s;o well as
they would do a&s;under.</P>
<P>If any Man enquires why this is &s;o? Why
that, which in it&s;elf is Agreeable, U&s;eful, and
Profitable, &s;hould not be &s;o when join'd with ano|ther
Thing equally &s;o? An&s;wer might be given
&s;everal Ways, in Brief thus.</P>
<P>1. The Thing is Party-cur&s;t, it is attack'd by
a Variety of Cla&s;hing, Quarrelling People; &s;ome
<PB N="33" REF="31">
cry it &s;o much up beyond its real Merit, and o|thers
run it down &s;o far below, that the Strife
has rendred it a Bone of Contention.</P>
<P>2. Some find fault with it, becau&s;e they do
not under&s;tand it, and &s;ome becau&s;e <HI>they think</HI>
they do;&mdash;and the Multitude of Inquirers on
one Hand, and Expo&s;itors on the other; &s;ome
asking what it is, who know well enough before;
others pretending to tell them what it is, while
they know nothing of it them&s;elves; by this the
Text is rendred Intricate, which in it&s;elf was
plain enough, and we amu&s;e our&s;elves with Dif|ficulties
where there are none.</P>
<P>3. The Project and the People are unhappily
ill &s;orted, by putting the Trade as an Appendix
to the Debt; had the Debt been &s;ettled on a
Fund, as above; had Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> been allowed
for Intere&s;t till the Principal had been paid; or
had they added One <HI>per Cent.</HI> more, and &s;unk
the Principal, the People had gone away well &s;ati&s;|fied,
and they had &s;old for the full Value; if the
Government had had any re&s;erved Stock of them
they would ha' been as Current as <HI>Chequer</HI> Bills,
and might ha' been i&s;&s;ued out on any Account
what&s;oever; but clogg'd with this <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, like Two Men in the Water, who are
but Young Swimmers, alone they might make
&s;hift to get out well enough, and People at Hand
would help them; but cla&s;ping together they
&s;ink out of reach, and drown one another.</P>
<P>So of the Trade, it falls among People unac|quainted
with Trade, that have no Occa&s;ion to
venture to Sea, under&s;tand nothing of Merchan|dizing,
<PB N="34" REF="32">
and therefore they cannot think of it with
any Temper. Butchers, Gra&s;iers, Chee&s;emongers,
Ship chandlers, Carpenters. Smiths, (and other
Handicrafts,) Brewers, Bakers, Coopers, and the
like, and an infinite Number of the&s;e; to talk
to the&s;e of a <HI>South Sea</HI> Trade is to talk <HI>Hebrew</HI>
and <HI>Arabic:</HI> Like <HI>E&s;op</HI>'s Cock, they &s;purn the
Diamond with Contempt, and will &s;ell Two
of them for an Handful of Barley.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Grounds and Rea&s;ons
of the Contempt of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade: The
An&s;wers and Remedies I re&s;erve to &s;peak of in
its Cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Particular Article of the
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> and &s;ince it is to no Pur|po&s;e
to Object again&s;t the Conjunction, let us
enquire into them complexly.</P>
<P>1. Is the Annuity the wor&s;e for the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Stock?</P>
<P>2. Is the Stock the wor&s;e for the Annuity?</P>
<P>The Annuity is the wor&s;e for the Stock thus far&punc;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that 10 <HI>per Cent</HI> upon the Original Stock
is liable to be call'd for, to be &s;et apart as a Stock
for carrying on a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> &s;o
far you may &s;ay the Annuity is the wor&s;e.&mdash;But
then this is al&s;o upon a Suppo&s;ition that this
<HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade &s;hall entirely mi&s;carry. And the&s;e
Objections lye again&s;t that Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>1. If it does mi&s;carry it does not follow that
they mu&s;t run out all their Stock; there are In|&s;tances
<PB N="35" REF="33">
of many Undertakings in Trade, where the
Parties finding a Stop to the Pro&s;pect, or an Im|probability
of Succe&s;s, have laid it down with lit|tle
Lo&s;s, perhaps. One Quarter lo&s;t, or more; and
is all this Clamour worth while for the Hazard of 2
and 1/2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould im&s;carry; for it
does not follow they mu&s;t wind off all the Bot|tom;
it is very probable the Company will &s;ee
whether they are likely to &s;tand or no, get or
lo&s;e, hold or fail, before they have run out One
Quarter Part of &s;o great a Stock as is propo&s;ed to
be adventured here.</P>
<P>2. If it &s;hould not mi&s;carry, but the Trade be
e&s;tabli&s;hed and thrive, all this Argument is then
at an End; then happy would be the Day that
the Stock was Sub&s;crib'd, happy the Thought
that laid the Scheme; and he that cries it mu&s;t
down, now flatters us then &s;oone&s;t with his good
Opinion of it, and pretends he thought &s;o from
the Beginning; nor can the Trade be then the
wor&s;e for the Annuity.</P>
<P>But how can this be, <HI>&s;ay the Objectors?</HI> Suc|ceed!
It cannot &s;ucceed! the Thing is not Practi|cable,
the Door is not Open for a Trade; to &s;et
People to trade now, is as if the Government
wanted more Confederates, and were to incorpo|rate
a Body of Men to make War, not to Trade;
that the New Company &s;hall join in the Grand
Alliance; and, like a little Republick, help to carry
on the War; that we mu&s;t fight our Way thro',
and trade <HI>au coup de Canon.</HI> A Trade! <HI>&s;ays One,</HI>
It mu&s;t be a Trade in Blood, we &s;ee no other
Trade in view; for let which Party &s;oever pre|vail
the Trade mu&s;t be carried on by Force; nei|ther
King <HI>Philip,</HI> nor King <HI>Charles,</HI> will let their
<PB N="36" REF="34">
Subjects Trade with you but by Force, on Pain of the
Gallows, and with all po&s;&s;ible Difficulty and
Hazard. It is therfore but an Amu&s;ement of
Trade, &s;ay they without any Reality; and this
being &s;o vi&s;ible a Collu&s;ion, they tell us, makes
all the re&s;t be &s;u&s;pected, and is a great Argu|ment
of the General Di&s;like.</P>
<P>And thus I am brought to enquire, as <HI>in the
Title,</HI> Whether this Trade is to be carried on,
<HI>yea,</HI> or <HI>No?</HI> Whether in Reality &s;uch a Trade
is Probable or Fea&s;ible? Or, Whether it is Im|practicable,
and not to be attempted but with a
Folly next to Lunacy, which is &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>To come at this Que&s;tion in a Po&s;ture that
may render the An&s;wer intelligible, it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;tate the Thing it&s;elf que&s;tion'd about,
and to lay down in as clear Terms as po&s;&s;ible
what this Thing call'd the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade is;
what it means as it is now vulgarly accepted;
and what we are to under&s;tand by it.</P>
<P>By the Trade to the <HI>South Seas</HI> we are to un|der&s;tand
One of the&s;e Three Things.</P>
<P>1. An Open, Free Commerce of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Na|tion
to and in the &s;everal Ports and Places of <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI>
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> either &s;uch as are, or
&s;hall be, Reduced by us, or by King <HI>Charles</HI> III.
with Liberty to carry our Manufactures and Mer|chandizes,
Ships and Factor, thither directly, with|out
Stop in <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and to lade, return and
bring back from thence &s;uch Goods as &s;hall be
purcha&s;ed there; and in &s;hort, to Trade thither
as the <HI>French</HI> do now with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under
King <HI>Philip,</HI> or as we do to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="35">
And in this Sen&s;e I think it can be no Offence to
&s;ay this Trade can never be Carried on.</P>
<P>2. Or, <HI>We are to under&s;tand</HI> a Settling in &s;ome
Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> whe|ther
by Way of Conque&s;t, Factory, or otherwi&s;e,
as by the 6th Article of the Grand Alliance (quo|ted
before) we are allowed to do; and keeping
the &s;aid Settlement as our own, erect there a Free
Market for our <HI>European</HI> Goods; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
having Free Acce&s;s to come thither to Buy, and
we having Liberty from thence to trade to their
Dominions above.&mdash;And in this Sen&s;e it is as
Impracticable to carry on this Trade as in the
other.</P>
<P>3. Or, by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> we are
to under&s;tand our Seizing &s;ome &s;uch Part or Place
in <HI>America,</HI> whether already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, or not po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd,
as we &s;hall think proper, and taking it as
our own, by Virtue of the Treaty above noted, to
&s;ettle, plant and inhabit the &s;ame as a Colony,
erecting there &s;uch Trade with the Adjacent
Countries, whether <HI>Spaniards</HI> or others, and im|proving
the Native Fruitfulne&s;s of the Place as
much as po&s;&s;ible, taking at the &s;ame Time all
Opportunities to open a Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
as much as Circum&s;tances will admit, and which
there is no Que&s;tion will be con&s;iderable.&mdash;And
this is the Way a Trade may be carried on.&mdash;This
I am of the Opinion is the Way of
Trade the Government propo&s;es, and what they
mean by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> and this is
&s;o far from being little or incon&s;iderable, howe|ver
it may be le&s;s than the Golden Mountains &s;ome
People have form'd Notions of in their Imagi|nation,
<PB N="38" REF="36">
that this Trade is not only probable to
be Great, but capable of being the Greate&s;t, mo&s;t
Valuable, mo&s;t Profitable, and mo&s;t Encrea&s;ing
Branch of Trade in our whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce,
well worth all the Hazard, Adventure, Expence,
and Pains of the Undertaking; &s;ufficient to encou|rage
us in the Pro&s;pect, and reward us in the Exe|cution;
a Trade, which had it been offer'd to the
Merchandizing Part of Mankind, who under&s;tood
Trade, who were employ'd in Commerce, and
accu&s;tom'd to Adventures, and not unhappily
join'd in and tied down to a Rabble of ca&s;ual
Sub&s;cribers, neither inclin'd to, capable of, or in
the lea&s;t having a Genius to trade, it would no
doubt have met with another kind of Reception
than now it has.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;ht that in order to &s;et Things
right among us, People would give them&s;elves
leave to di&s;tingui&s;h a little between what <HI>is,</HI>
and what <HI>is not,</HI> the De&s;ign in this Thing, cal|led
the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade, and between what <HI>may
be done,</HI> and <HI>may not be done,</HI> that we may not
pre&s;ently argue our&s;elves out of all the Trade
becau&s;e we have not the Gates of <HI>Mexico</HI> opened
to us. This is no Part of the Thing, the very
Word <HI>South-Seas</HI> in the Act of Parliament de|notes
otherwi&s;e, the Words <HI>find out</HI> and <HI>di&s;cover</HI>
mention'd in the Act tell us otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>We are to find out or di&s;cover &s;ome Place or
Places in <HI>America,</HI> where we may fix and &s;ettle
a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colony, which by the Treaty is to be
our own; and is not this enough? Will not Trade
fall in? Will not the Country produce to us as well
as to the <HI>Spaniards?</HI> Are we le&s;s indu&s;trious
<PB N="39" REF="37">
than they; if we fix in a barren Spot that's our
Fault, but why not &s;omewhere among the Gold,
the Silver, the Drugs, the Indico, Cocoa, Coche|neal,
and the like, as well as they; and being &s;i|tuated
here, fixt, and &s;ettled, can we want a
Trade? Did any Man think all we were to do
was only to carry Goods to <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Pana|ma,</HI>
and bring home Money? This bears no Pro|portion
to the De&s;ign, nor is of a Duration worth
our depending upon; for it would be every
Day in the Power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to put an end
to it, and prohibit it again. But our Bu&s;ine&s;s is
to &s;eize and po&s;&s;e&s;s, <HI>mark the Word in the Article
of the Grand Alliance,</HI> and to keep it for our own.</P>
<P>This is then what we are to under&s;tand by a
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that we &s;hall,
under the Protection, in the Name, and by the
Power of Her Maje&s;ty, <HI>Seize, Take&punc;</HI> and <HI>Po&s;|&s;e&s;s,</HI>
&s;uch Port or Place, or Places, Land, Ter|ritory,
Country or Dominion, <HI>call it what you
plea&s;e,</HI> as we &s;ee fit in <HI>America,</HI> and <HI>Keep it for
our own, Keeping it</HI> implies Planting, Settling,
Inhabiting, Spreading, and all that is u&s;ual in
&s;uch Ca&s;es: And <HI>when this is done,</HI> what are we
to do with it? <HI>Why,</HI> we are to Trade <HI>to</HI> it, and
<HI>from</HI> it; <HI>Whither?</HI> Where-ever we can with
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> or any Body that will Trade with us;
and it is not &s;aying we &s;hall have no Trade with
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when we &s;ay they will not &s;uffer
their People freely to Trade with us; but let the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> get a good Footing on the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> and let them and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
alone for Trading with one another, let the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> prevent it if he can.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="38">
This is what I am willing to have called the
True De&s;ign of this <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and I
am the rather &s;o, becau&s;e I have &s;een no Scheme,
nor can I form any Scheme in my Thoughts upon
any other Foundation that is Fea&s;ible in its Nature,
or Practicable in any of its Parts.</P>
<P>The Contrivers of this Undertaking know too
well the Temper, Con&s;titution, and State of
Affairs, of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to have pro|mis'd
to them&s;elves, that by any Treaty, Capitu|lation,
or Stipulation, either in <HI>New Spain</HI> or
<HI>Old,</HI> they will ever be brought to lay open the
Trade of their <HI>Indies</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or indeed to
any Nation of the World.</P>
<P>Perhaps they might be brought to admit a
Trade to particular Places for Provi&s;ions, Fi&s;h,
Corn, or &s;uch Things as they may more particu|larly
want in tho&s;e Places for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of
their People: Or, they may be brought to treat
with you for an A&s;&s;ento or Permi&s;&s;ion to bring
Negroes to them; a Thing more proper for the
<HI>African</HI> Company than any other; and the Rea|&s;on
for that may be only becau&s;e they know not
where el&s;e to have them. But that they will per|mit
you to a Free Importation among them of your
<HI>European</HI> Manufactures, and Exportation of
Bullion from them, is &s;o contrary to the Nature of
their Trade, &s;o de&s;tructive to their own Intere&s;t,
and would be &s;o fatal to the very Life and Be|ing
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> I mean
as to Commerce, that unle&s;s the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to
be dive&s;ted of common Sen&s;e, Infatuate, and given
up, abandoning their own Commerce, throwing a|way
<PB N="41" REF="39">
the only Valuable Stake they have left in
the World, and in &s;hort, bent to their own Ruin,
we cannot &s;ugge&s;t that they will ever on any

Valuable, indeed &s;o Ine&s;timable a Jewel, as the
Exclu&s;ive Power of Trade to their own Plantati|ons

<P>The Mi&s;taking of this I believe to be another
Rea&s;on, and perhaps One of the Chief too, of the

<PB N="42" REF="40">
and then Banter them with the Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity
of putting them in Execution.</P>
<P>This is &s;o much the wor&s;e too in this Ca&s;e
by how much there was no Manner of Rea&s;on
or Occa&s;ion for this Mi&s;take; and that the De|&s;ign
of Planting, Settling, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, as is
above noted on the Continent of <HI>America</HI> or <HI>South-Seas,</HI>
is every Way &s;ufficient to all the Ends, and
to all the Rea&s;onable Wi&s;hes, of the Government
in the Fir&s;t Propo&s;al: Fruitful of all Manner of
Improvement, capable of as many, and indeed
many more, Advantages than the &s;uppo&s;ed Free
Trade with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions, which are
already planted; and this, if it were duly con|&s;idered,
would &s;et us right in our Thoughts
about it, I mean as to the Propo&s;al of &s;uch a
Trade being Advantageous to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Subjects of this Project been Mer|chants,
bred to Bu&s;ine&s;s, acquainted with Trade,
and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is as well to under&s;tand
as to &s;eek out New Adventures, it had been
embraced with all imaginable Eagerne&s;s and
Satisfaction, far from being run down and blown
up in this Manner by the Town; the Di&s;a&s;ter
lyes in this, as before noted, that the Debt and
the Trade going together is ill &s;orted with the
People it falls upon; they that are qualified to
claim the Debt, being &s;ome of them the wor&s;t
qualified to embark in the Trade of any People in
the Town, and con&s;equently the be&s;t qualified
to find Fault with, and make a Noi&s;e about it.</P>
<P>No Men are &s;o apt to di&s;like and complain of
a Thing, e&s;pecially of this Nature, as tho&s;e who
<PB N="43" REF="41">
do not under&s;tand it; and as they are forwarde&s;t
to complain, &s;o are they harde&s;t to be an&s;wered
and &s;atisfied by Rea&s;on; and this perhaps is not
the lea&s;t Di&s;after which at pre&s;ent attends this
Project, which perhaps will never recover the
Bla&s;t of Reproach, thus ca&s;t upon it, but by
length of Time, the Remedy which Cures many
Di&s;tempers of the State be&s;ides this.</P>
<P>I know there is another Popular Rea&s;on given
us for the general Di&s;like of this Thing, and that
is, the obliging all the People to &s;ub&s;cribe whe|ther
they will or no; and much is &s;aid on this
Article, calling it a Force, an Inva&s;ion of Pro|perty,
and a Breach of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty.</P>
<P>Now, tho' the Act of Parliament may be
pleaded in Bar of this Charge; becau&s;e, what is
done in Parliament is every Man's Act and Deed,
and a Voluntary Conce&s;&s;ion can be no Force; al|&s;o
it is no kind of a Force that the Law defends,
and the Nature of the Thing obliges to; yet is
here no real Force in the literal Sen&s;e, nor does
it &s;ay, that tho&s;e who will not comply to &s;ub|&s;cribe
his Debt &s;hall never be paid; it does in|deed
exclude them from the pre&s;ent Benefit, but
it takes away none of their Claim to both the
Principal and Intere&s;t from the Government, as
before. However, this is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here,
the Parliament no que&s;tion will defend the Ju|&s;tice
of their own Acts.</P>
<P>My Bu&s;ine&s;s now is to enquire how this lat|ter
Trade, upon the Foot of a Colony or Planta|tion,
can be carried on; for having Advanc'd, and,
I think, with good Rea&s;on, that it can be done no
<PB N="44" REF="42">
other Way; if I do not &s;hew you that it may ef|fectually
be done this Way, I &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed
writing a Satyr upon the Undertaking, which I
a&s;&s;ure you I am not.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Part of <HI>America,</HI> I
think a Project worthy the Nation, and worthy
the Parliament; and that this War has been the
only Juncture for it that has happened the&s;e
Fifty Years, and the like whereof may never
happen again; I &s;ee no Misfortune in it, but its
being tack'd to the Debt above-mentioned; and
con&s;equently, a Set of People, adapted to the
Concern, who are every Way un&s;uitable to it,
and uncapable of under&s;tanding it, better quali|fied
to rail at it, than embark in it; this, I &s;ay,
I count the Misfortune of the Nation in it, and
nothing but an Exqui&s;ite Management can prevent
the Evil Effects of this Misfortune; nor had this
Di&s;a&s;ter happened to it, but from the earne&s;t De|&s;ire
the Propo&s;ers had to make the People &s;ome
amends, over and above, for the &s;cop of Payment
they had met with in their Publick Debts; and in
any Age but ours perhaps it would ha' pa&s;t for
an Amends, and for an Advantage, nay, in ours
it would ha' p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t &s;o, had it not fallen upon &s;uch
a Promi&s;cuous Multitude of People, not in Cir|cum&s;tances
to receive the Advantages, to under|&s;tand
the Thing, or put any Hand to help for|ward
the Succe&s;s of it.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things have join'd in with the Pub|lick
Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Times, to render the Pro|ject,
as it now &s;tands, unacceptable, I cannot
think that this does yet in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en the
Value of a <HI>South-Sea</HI> Undertaking in general, as
<PB N="45" REF="43">
&s;uch and as it is; a taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Part of
<HI>America,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, and erect
a Trade thither from <HI>England,</HI> as afore&s;aid, again&s;t
which, (ab&s;tracted from the Mini&s;try, the Publick
Credit, Parties and Factions, among us, with
which, in this Argument, I have nothing to do)
again&s;t this; I &s;ay, I believe no Man will rai&s;e
One Objection, but all unanimou&s;ly agree&punc; that
we wi&s;h to &s;ee it put in Execution, as a Foundati|on,
upon which may be Built an Immen&s;e Trade,
a New, and very much Wanted Vent, for our
Manufactures of <HI>Britain,</HI> a New, and as
much Wanted, Vent for the Provi&s;ions, and Cat|tle,
the Produce of our Colonies on the <HI>North</HI>
of <HI>America;</HI> and a wonderful Encrea&s;e of our
Navigation, Strength, and People.</P>
<P>It is Impo&s;&s;ible for the Author of this to fini&s;h what
he had re&s;olv'd to do here towards de&s;cribing the
Nature of, and &s;ub&s;equent Mea&s;ures for, pur&s;uing
this De&s;ign. If this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay appears acceptable,
I may in a Second Part go forward with it, and
therein di&s;tingui&s;h more plainly between carrying
on this Affair as an Improvement of Trade&punc; and
carrying it on as a National Intere&s;t. I know
the Endeavours u&s;ed to make it appear a Te&s;t
of Parties, and a Trial of Skill between Sides;
of this I &s;hall take no Cognizance; but if a Se|cond
Part of this Work comes to be Publi&s;h'd,
I &s;hall endeavour rather to &s;hew what you may
do, than what I fear you will not do.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h the Conque&s;t of that Part we
may plant in, and the planting it&s;elf; or, in
&s;hort, between the Queen's Part and the Mer|chants;
and &s;hew you how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it
<PB N="46" REF="44">
is that they be kept a&s;under. That the Trade mu&s;t
be entirely unincumbered with War; that it is
the Governments Part, not only to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on,
but to keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion when taken; that
Protection mu&s;t be effectually provided for, or
el&s;e no Attempt can be Succe&s;sful. I &s;hall endea|vour
to explain what this Protection will be, a|gain&s;t
whom, in what Manner needful, what
probable Oppo&s;ition may be expected, and from
who.</P>
<P>2. I may give you an E&s;&s;ay at the Great Que|&s;tion
<HI>Where</HI> this Settlement may, or can, or mu&s;t,
be made; and in doing this I may make Publick
&s;ome of the Schemes which I had the Honour to lay
were laid before his late Maje&s;ty in the Beginning
of this War, and which were &s;o approved of both
by him&s;elf, and &s;everal of tho&s;e whom his Maje&s;ty
was plea&s;ed to communicate them to, that nothing
but the unhappy Death of that Glorious Prince
prevented that this Attempt, (in&s;tead of that which
has proved &s;o fatal at <HI>Barcelona,</HI>) had taken up the
la&s;t Seven Years&punc; with the Blood and Trea&s;ure
of this Nation, which in all Probability e'er now
would have brought back as many Millions as the
other has carried out.</P>
<P>3. I &s;hall in &s;uch an E&s;&s;ay give convincing
Proofs, that if &s;uch an Attempt may be made,
and in due Manner carried on, &s;uch a Trade may
be rai&s;ed from it as &s;hall &s;ufficiently recompence
the Long, Tedious and Expen&s;ive Fatigues of
the Whole War.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45">
I &s;hall conclude this with what I heartily wi&s;h&punc;</P>
<P>1. That tho&s;e Two likely and encouraging
Pro&s;pects of the Publick Good had not been
thus unhappily join'd.</P>
<P>2. That the Parliament may, if it plea&s;es
God &s;o far to enlighten them, yet &s;eparate
them, or rather re&s;tore them to their Inde|pendent
Exi&s;tence, which I doubt not would e|qually
&s;atisfie the People concern'd, the Fir&s;t
Propo&s;er, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>And what the Advantage of both to the Nati|on
might be in &s;uch a Re&s;tored, Separated E&s;tate,
&s;hall be the Subject of farther Con&s;ideration.</P>
