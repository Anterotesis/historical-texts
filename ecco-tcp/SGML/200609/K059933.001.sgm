<OPENER><DATELINE>Switzerland, <DATE>September 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;o long a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of our corre&s;pondence, after a &s;ilence like that of death, and a &s;eparation which for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;eemed as final as if we had been divided by the limits of <Q REND="inline">that country from who&s;e bourn no travel|ler returns,</Q> with what grateful plea|&s;ure did I recognize your hand-writing, with what eagerne&s;s did I break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;eal of your welcome letter, and with what &s;oothing emotions receive the tidings of
<PB N="2" REF="4">
your welfare, and the a&s;&s;urance of your affection! Your letter was a tali&s;man that &s;erved to conjure up a thou&s;and images of &s;orrows and of joys that are pa&s;t, and which were obliterated by the turbulent &s;en&s;ations of di&s;may and horror.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will not be unintere&s;ting to you to receive from me a &s;ketch of the &s;cenes which have pa&s;&s;ed in Paris &s;ince the &s;econd of June, an epocha to be for ever deplored by the friends of liberty, which &s;eated a vulgar and &s;anguinary de&s;pot on the ruins of a throne, till the memorable 28th of July 1794, when Liberty, bleed|ing with a thou&s;and wounds, revived once more. If the picture I &s;end you of tho&s;e extraordinary events be not well drawn, it is at lea&s;t marked with the characters of truth, &s;ince I have been the witne&s;s of the &s;cenes I de&s;cribe, and have known per&s;onally all the principal actors. Tho&s;e &s;cenes, connected in my mind with all the detail of dome&s;tic &s;orrow, with the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
feelings of private &s;ympathy, with the tears of mourning friend&s;hip, are im|pre&s;&s;ed upon my memory in characters that are indelible. They ri&s;e in &s;ad &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion like the &s;hades of Banquo's line, and pa&s;s along my &s;huddering recollec|tion.</P>
<P>After having &s;o long &s;uffered without daring to utter a complaint, it will relieve my oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, to give you an ac|count of our late &s;ituation; and, in &s;o do|ing, I &s;hall feel the &s;ame &s;ort of melan|choly plea&s;ure as the mariner who paints the horrors of the tempe&s;t when he has reached the harbour, and &s;heds a tender tear over his lo&s;t companions who have peri&s;hed in the wreck&mdash;Ah! my dear friend, that overwhelming recollection fills my heart with angui&s;h which only they who have &s;uffered can conceive. Tho&s;e per&s;ons in who&s;e &s;ociety I mo&s;t delighted, in who&s;e cultivated minds and enlight|ened conver&s;ation I found the &s;ole com|pen&s;ation
<PB N="4" REF="6">
for what I had lo&s;t in leaving my country and my friends&mdash;to &s;ee them torn from me for ever, to know the pre|ci&s;e moment in which they were dragged to execution, to feel&mdash;but let me turn a while from images of horror which I have con&s;idered but too deeply, and which have ca&s;t a &s;adne&s;s over my mind that can never, never be di&s;pelled. Whenever they recur, a funereal veil &s;eems to me to be &s;pread over nature; and neither the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ent, nor the a&s;&s;urance of future &s;afety, neither the charms of &s;ociety, nor all the graces, nor all the wonders of the &s;cenes I am now contem|plating, can di&s;&s;ipate the gloom.</P>
<P>Not long after the reign of Robe&s;pierre began, all pa&s;&s;ports to leave the country were refu&s;ed, and the arre&s;tation of the Engli&s;h re&s;iding in France was decreed by the national convention; but the very next day the decree was repealed on the repre&s;entations of &s;ome French mer|chants,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
who &s;hewed its impolicy. We therefore concluded that we had no &s;uch mea&s;ures to fear in future; and we heard from what we believed to be good autho|rity, that if any decree pa&s;&s;ed with re|&s;pect to the Engli&s;h, it would be that of their being ordered to leave the republic. The political clouds in the mean time gathered thick around the hemi&s;phere: we heard rumours of &s;everity and terror, which &s;eemed like tho&s;e hollow noi&s;es that roll in the dark gulph of the volcano, and portend its dangerous eruptions: but no one could calculate how far the threatened mi&s;chief would extend, and how wide a wa&s;te of ruin would de&s;olate the land. Already con&s;iderable num|bers were impri&s;oned as &s;u&s;pected&mdash;<HI>&s;u&s;|pected!</HI> that indefinite word, which was tortured into every meaning of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, and became what the French call the <HI>mot de ralliement,</HI> the ini|tiative term of captivity and death.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
One evening when Bernardin St. Pierre, the author of the charming little novel of Paul and Virginia, was drinking tea with me, and while I was li&s;tening to a de&s;crip|tion he gave me of a &s;mall hou&s;e which he had lately built in the centre of a beau|tiful i&s;land of the river that flows by E&s;&s;onne, which he was employed in de|corating, and where he meant to reali&s;e &s;ome of the lovely &s;cenes which his fine imagination has pictured in the Mauritius, I was &s;uddenly called away from this fairy land by the appearance of a friend, who ru&s;hed into the room, and with great agi|tation told us that a decree had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in the national convention, ordering all the Engli&s;h in France to be put into ar|re&s;tation in the &s;pace of four-and-twenty hours, and their property to be con&s;i&s;|cated. We pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, and the following day in anxiety and perturbation not to be de&s;cribed, ex|pecting every moment the commi&s;&s;aries
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of the revolutionary committee and their guards, to put in force the mandates of the convention. As the day advanced, our terror increa&s;ed: in the evening we received information that mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h acquaintances were conducted to pri&s;on. At length night came; and no commi&s;&s;aries appearing, we began to flat|ter our&s;elves that, being a family of wo|men, it was intended that we &s;hould be &s;pared, for the time was only now ar|rived when neither &s;ex nor age gave any claim to compa&s;&s;ion. Overcome with fa|tigue and emotion, we went to bed with &s;ome faint hopes of exemption from the general calamity of our countrymen. The&s;e hopes were however but of &s;hort duration. At two in the morning we were awakened by a loud knocking at the gate of the hotel, which we well knew to be the fatal &s;ignal of our approaching captivity; and a few minutes after, the bell of our apartments was rung with violence. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf hurried
<PB N="8" REF="10">
on our clothes and went with trembling &s;teps to the anti-chamber, when we found two commi&s;&s;aries of the revolutionary committee of our &s;ection, accompanied by a guard, two of whom were placed at the outer door with their &s;words drawn, while the re&s;t entered the room. One of the&s;e con&s;tituted authorities held a paper in his hand, which was a copy of the decree of the convention, and which he offered to read to us; but we declined hearing it, and told him we were ready to obey the law. Seeing us pale and trembling, he and his colleague endeavoured to comfort us; they begged us to compo&s;e our|&s;elves; they repeated that our arre&s;tation was only part of a general political mea|&s;ure, and that innocence had nothing to fear.&mdash;Alas! innocence was no longer any plea for &s;afety. They took a proc&egrave;s|verbal of our names, ages, the country where we were born, the length of time we had lived in France; and when this regi&s;ter was fini&s;hed, we were told that
<PB N="9" REF="11">
we mu&s;t prepare to depart. We were each of us allowed to take as much clean linen as we could tie up in a handker|chief, and which was all the property which we could now call our own; the re&s;t, in con&s;equence of the decree, being &s;eized by the nation. Sometimes, under the pre&s;&s;ure of a great calamity, the mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ations are excited by little circum|&s;tances which form a part of the whole, and &s;erve in the retro&s;pect of memory, like certain points in a land&s;cape, to call up the &s;urrounding &s;cenery: &s;uch is the feeling with which I recall the moments when, having got out of our apartments, we &s;tood upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e &s;urrounded with guards, while the commi&s;&s;aries placed the &s;eals on our doors. The con|tra&s;t between the pri&s;on where we were going to be led, and that home which was now clo&s;ed again&s;t us, perhaps for years, filled my heart with a pang for which language has no utterance. Some of the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
guards were di&s;po&s;ed to treat us with rudene&s;s; which the commi&s;&s;aries &s;ternly repre&s;&s;ed, and, ordering them to keep at &s;ome di&s;tance, made us lean on their arms, for they &s;aw we &s;tood in need of &s;upport, in our way to the committee-room. We found this place crowded with commi&s;|&s;aries and &s;oldiers, &s;ome &s;leeping, &s;ome writing, and others amu&s;ing them&s;elves with plea&s;antries of a revolutionary na|ture, to which we li&s;tened trembling. Every half-hour a guard entered, con|ducting Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, among whom were no women but our&s;elves. Here we pa&s;&s;ed the long night; and at eight in the morning our countrymen were taken to the pri&s;on of the Madelonettes, while we were &s;till detained at the committee. We di&s;covered afterwards that this was owing to the humanity of the commi&s;&s;aries who arre&s;ted us, and who &s;ent to the munici|pality to know if we might not be taken to the Luxembourg, where we &s;hould
<PB N="11" REF="13">
find good accommodations, while at the Madelonettes' &s;carcely a bed could be procured. All that compa&s;&s;ion could dictate, all the lenity which it was in the power of the&s;e commi&s;&s;aries to di&s;play without incurring ten years impri&s;onment, the penalty annexed to leaving us at li|berty, we experienced. Humanity from members of a revolutionary committee! You will perhaps exclaim in the language of the Jews, <Q REND="inline">Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</Q> It is certain, how|ever, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, that our two commi&s;&s;aries behaved towards us as if they remembered that we were defencele&s;s women in a land of &s;trangers; that we were accu&s;ed of no crime except that of being born on the &s;oil of England; and that, if we were puni&s;hed, we had only de&s;erved it by tru&s;ting with too ea&s;y a belief in that national faith which was now violated. By the way, when I tell you that we experienced compa&s;&s;ion from
<PB N="12" REF="14">
revolutionary committees, you will not &s;uppo&s;e I mean to a&s;&s;ert that compa&s;&s;ion|ate men formed the majority of their com|mittees. The greater part of mankind in all ages, even when accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t elevated rank, have abu&s;ed power: how then could it be hoped that un|limited power would not be abu&s;ed, which was confided to men who were for the mo&s;t part ignorant and unenlightened; men who, till that period, confined to their &s;hops and their manual occupations, were &s;uddenly tran&s;ported into &s;plendid hotels, with authority to unlock cabinets blazing with jewels, to &s;eize upon heaps of un|counted gold, and with a &s;troke of their pens to di&s;per&s;e as many warrants for im|pri&s;onment, as caprice, envy, or mi&s;taken zeal might prompt; who were made ar|biters of the liberty, property, and even lives of their fellow-citizens; and who were incited, nay even compelled, to acts of violence under the penalty of being
<PB N="13" REF="15">
branded with the guilt of <HI>moderanti&s;m?</HI> When &s;uch was the new-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, when it required the mo&s;t daring courage to be humane, and when to be cruel was to be &s;afe, can you wonder, that among the revolutionary committees in general there was not <Q REND="inline">as much pity to be found as would fill the eye of a wren?</Q> Af|ter pa&s;&s;ing the whole day, as we had done the night, in the committee-room, orders arrived from the municipality to &s;end us to the former palace, now the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg, where we were attended by two guards within each coach, while two walked on each &s;ide. What &s;trange &s;en&s;ations I felt as I pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of Paris, and a&s;cended the &s;teps of the Luxembourg, a &s;ad &s;pectacle to the crowd! We were conducted to the range of apartments above the former rooms of &s;tate, where we were received with the utmo&s;t civility by the keeper of the pri|&s;on, Benoit, a name which many a wretch
<PB N="14" REF="16">
has ble&s;&s;ed, for many a &s;orrow his com|pa&s;&s;ion and gentlene&s;s have &s;oftened. His heart was indeed but ill &s;uited to his office; and often he incurred the di&s;|plea&s;ure of tho&s;e &s;avages by whom he was employed, and who wi&s;hed their victims to feel the full extent of their calamity, unmitigated by any detail of kindne&s;s, any attention to tho&s;e little wants which this benevolent per&s;on was anxious to re|move, or tho&s;e few comforts which he had the power to be&s;tow. The barbarians thought it not enough to load their vic|tims with iron, unle&s;s <Q REND="inline">it entered into their &s;ouls.</Q> But Benoit was not to be intimidated into cruelty. Without de|viating from his duty, he pur&s;ued his &s;teady cour&s;e of humanity; and may the grateful benedictions of the unhappy have a&s;cended for him to heaven!</P>
<P>We had a good apartment allotted us, which a few weeks before had been inha|bited by Valaz&eacute;, one of the deputies of
<PB N="15" REF="17">
the convention, who was now transferred to the pri&s;on of the Conciergerie. Our apartment, with &s;everal adjoining, had &s;oon after the event of the 31&s;t of May been prepared for the impri&s;onment of the deputies of the <HI>cot&eacute; droit</HI>; and for that purpo&s;e the windows which commanded a fine view of the Luxembourg-gardens had been blocked up to the upper panes, which were barred with iron. Mattra&s;&s;es were provided for us in this gloomy chamber, the door of which was locked by one of our jailors; and we had &s;uffered too much fatigue of body, as well as di&s;|turbance of mind, not to find a refuge from &s;orrow in &s;ome hours of profound &s;leep.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning the &s;un aro&s;e with unu&s;ual brightne&s;s; and with the aid of a table on which I mounted, I &s;aw through our grated windows the beau|tiful gardens of the Luxembourg. Its tall maje&s;tic trees had not yet lo&s;t their foliage; and though they were fallen, like our fortunes, "into the &s;ear, the yellow leaf," they &s;till pre&s;ented tho&s;e rich gra|dations of colouring which belong to au|tumn. The &s;un gilded the gothic &s;pires of the &s;urrounding convents, which lifted up their tall points above the venerable groves; while on the back-ground of the &s;cenery aro&s;e the hills of Meudon. It &s;eemed to me as if the declining &s;ea&s;on had &s;hed its la&s;t intere&s;ting graces over the land&s;cape to &s;ooth my afflicted &s;pirit;
<PB N="17" REF="19">
and &s;uch was the effect it produced. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to contemplate the beauties of nature without that enthu|&s;ia&s;tic plea&s;ure which &s;wells into devo|tion; and when &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions are excited in the mind, re&s;ignation to &s;uffer|ings, which in the &s;acred words of &s;cripture "are but for a moment," be|comes a le&s;s difficult duty.</P>
<P>The Luxembourg had lately been fitted up to receive the crowd of new inhabi|tants, with which it was going to be peopled, and every apartment obtained a particular appellation, which was in|&s;cribed on the out&s;ide of the door. We were lodged in the chamber of Cincin|natus: Brutus, I think, was our next-door neighbour; and Socrates had pitch|ed his tent at the di&s;tance of a few paces. The chamber of <HI>Indivi&s;ibility</HI> was allotted to &s;ome per&s;ons accu&s;ed of <HI>federali&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> was written in broad characters over the door of a pri&s;oner who was <HI>au</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<HI>&s;ecret</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In clo&s;e confinement.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to great names, it has been ob&s;erved in Paris, that almo&s;t all the illu&s;trious characters of Greece and Rome have been led to the Guillo|tine&mdash;for in&s;tance, Brutus, who often, while we were in pri&s;on, came from the municipality with orders from Anaxa|goras, was &s;oon after doomed to an equal fate,
<Q><L>Alike in fortune, as alike in fame!</L></Q>
together with Anachar&s;is, Agricola, Ari|&s;tides, Phocion, Sempronius Gracchus, Epaminondas, Cato the elder and the younger, and many other no le&s;s cele|brated worthies, who fell in &s;ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion under the &s;word of Maximilian<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The chri&s;tian name of Robe&s;pierre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our pri&s;on was filled with a multi|tude of per&s;ons of different conditions, characters, opinions and countries, and
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;eemed an epitome of the whole world. The mornings were devoted to bu&s;ine&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ed in little occupations, of which the pri&s;oners &s;ometimes complained, but for which perhaps they had rea&s;on to be thankful, &s;ince le&s;s lei&s;ure was left them to brood over their misfortunes. Every one had an appointed ta&s;k: in each chamber the pri&s;oners, by turns, lighted the fires, &s;wept the rooms, arranged the beds; and tho&s;e who could not afford to have dinner from a tavern, or, as the rich were yet permitted, from their own hou&s;es, prepared them&s;elves their meals. Every chamber formed a &s;ociety &s;ubject to certain regulations: a new pre&s;ident was cho&s;en every day, or every week, who enforced its laws and maintained good order. In &s;ome chambers no per|&s;on was allowed to &s;ing after ten, in others, after eleven at night. This re|&s;triction would, perhaps, have been &s;u|perfluous in England in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion;
<PB N="20" REF="22">
but it was highly nece&s;&s;ary here, &s;ince it prevented &s;uch of the pri&s;oners as were more light-hearted than the re&s;t from &s;inging all night long, to the an|noyance of others of their neighbours who might think the mu&s;ic which re|&s;ounded through the pri&s;on during the day fully &s;ufficient. The &s;y&s;tem of equality, whatever oppo&s;ition it met with in the world, was in its full extent prac|ti&s;ed in the pri&s;on. United by the &s;trong tie of common calamity, the pri&s;oners con&s;idered them&s;elves as bound to &s;often the general evil by mutual kind of|fices; and &s;trangers meeting in &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;oon became friends. The poor lived not upon the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table, but &s;hared the comforts of the repa&s;t; and here was found a community of the &s;mall &s;tock of goods, which belonged to the whole without the nece&s;&s;ity of a requi&s;ition. One broom,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
which was the property of a counte&s;s, was u&s;ed by twenty delicate hands to &s;weep the re&s;pective apartments; and a tea-kettle with which a friend furni&s;hed my mother was literally, as Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved of his own, "never allowed time to cool," but was employed from morning till night in furni&s;hing the Engli&s;h with tea.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the pri&s;oners met in an anti-chamber, which commanded a view of the gardens. Here they formed them&s;elves into groups: &s;ome conver&s;ed, others walked up and down the room; others gazed from the windows on the walks below, where, perhaps, they re|cognized a relation or a friend, who, being denied the privilege of vi&s;iting the pri&s;on, had come to &s;ooth them by a look or tear of &s;ympathy. During the fir&s;t days of our confinement, the pri|&s;oners were permitted to &s;ee their friends; and many a &s;triking contra&s;t of gaiety
<PB N="22" REF="24">
and &s;orrow did the anti-chamber then exhibit. In one part of the room, lively young people were amu&s;ing their vi&s;itors by a thou&s;and little plea&s;antries on their own &s;ituation; in another, a hu&s;band who was a pri&s;oner was taking leave of his wife who had come to &s;ee him, and &s;hed|ding tears over his child who was cling|ing to his knees, or had thrown its arms around his neck and refu&s;ed to be torn from its father. As the number of pri|&s;oners increa&s;ed, which they did &s;o ra|pidly, that in le&s;s than a week they were augmented from an hundred to a thou|&s;and, the rules of the pri&s;on became more &s;evere, and the admini&s;trators of the po|lice gave &s;trict orders, that no per&s;on whatever &s;hould be admitted. After this period the wives of &s;ome of the pri|&s;oners came regularly every day, bring|ing their children with them to the ter|race of the gardens. You often &s;aw the mother weeping, and the children &s;tretch|ing
<PB N="23" REF="25" MS="y">
out their little hands and pointing to their fathers, who &s;tood with their eyes fixed upon the objects of their affection: but &s;ometimes a &s;urly &s;entinel repre&s;&s;ed the&s;e melancholy effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, by calling to the per&s;ons in the walk to keep off, and make no &s;igns to the pri|&s;oners.&mdash;In the mean time, among the crowd that filled the public room were fine gentlemen and fine ladies, who had held the highe&s;t rank at court, &s;ome flirting together, others making appoint|ments for card parties or mu&s;ic in their own apartments in the evening, and others relating to us in pathetic language all they had &s;uffered, and all they had lo&s;t by the revolution. It was impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;ympathize in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;ome, or avoid wondering at the folly of others, in whom the &s;trong &s;en&s;e of dan|ger could not overcome the feelings of vanity; and who, although the tremen|dous decree had ju&s;t gone forth, making
<PB N="24" REF="26">
"terror the order of the day," and know|ing that the fatal pre-eminence of rank was the &s;ure&s;t pa&s;&s;port to the guillotine, could not re&s;i&s;t u&s;ing the pro&s;cribed no|menclature of "Madame la duche&s;&s;e," "Mon&s;ieur le comte," &amp;c. which &s;eem|ed to i&s;&s;ue from their lips like natural melodies to which the ear has long been accu&s;tomed, and which the voice invo|luntarily repeats. There were, however, among the captive nobility many per&s;ons who had too much good &s;en&s;e not to ob&s;erve a different conduct, who had proved them&s;elves real friends to liberty, had made important &s;acrifices in its cau&s;e, and who had been led to pri&s;on by revolutionary committees on pre|tences the mo&s;t trivial, and &s;ometimes from mi&s;takes the mo&s;t ludicrous. Such was the fate of the former count and counte&s;s of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who had di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the begin|ning of the revolution by the ardour
<PB N="25" REF="27">
of their patrioti&s;m and the largene&s;s of their civic donations. They had hither|to lived undi&s;turbed in their &s;plendid hotel, and there they might probably have continued to live a little longer, had not the Counte&s;s, in an evil hour, &s;ent down to her chateau a fine marble hearth, which by &s;ome accident was broken on the way. The &s;teward &s;ent a letter, in which, among other things, he men|tioned that the "foyer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foyer</HI> is the French name for hearth, and al&s;o for the central point of a &s;y&s;tem.</NOTE> mu&s;t be repaired at Paris." The letter was intercepted and read by the revolutionary committee. They &s;wore, they raged at the dark de&s;igns of ari&s;tocracy. "Here," &s;aid they, "is a daring plot indeed! a <HI>foyer</HI> of counter-revolution, and to be repaired at Paris! We mu&s;t in&s;tantly &s;eize the authors and the accomplices." In vain the Counte&s;s related the &s;tory of the

hearth, and a&s;&s;erted that no con&s;piracy lurked beneath the marble: both her&s;elf and her hu&s;band were conducted to the mai&s;on d'arr&ecirc;t of their &s;ection, from which we &s;aw them arrive at the Lux|embourg with about &s;ixty other per&s;ons at the hour of midnight, after having been led through the &s;treets in proce&s;|&s;ion by the light of an immen&s;e num|ber of flambeaux, and guarded by a whole battalion. The&s;e pri&s;oners had at lea&s;t the con&s;olation of finding them|&s;elves in the &s;ociety of many of their friends and acquaintances, for all the po|lite part of the fauxbourg St. Germain might be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;embled at the Luxembourg in ma&s;s. Impri&s;onment here was, however, no longer the ex|clu&s;ive di&s;tinction of former nobility, but was extended to great numbers of the former third e&s;tate. We had prie&s;ts, phy&s;icians, merchants, &s;hop-keepers, ac|tors and actre&s;&s;es, French valets and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
Engli&s;h waiting-women, all a&s;&s;embled to|gether in the public room; but in the private apartments Benoit's benevolent heart taught him the mo&s;t delicate &s;pe|cies of politene&s;s, by placing tho&s;e per|&s;ons together who were mo&s;t likely to find &s;atisfaction in each others' &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t many an eloquent tale of cha|teaux levelled with the ground, and palaces where, to borrow an image of de|&s;olation from O&s;&s;ian, "the fox might be &s;een looking out at the window," we &s;ometimes heard the complaints of &s;im|ple &s;orrow unallied to greatne&s;s; but, like the notes of the &s;tarling, "&s;o true in time to nature were they chanted," that they &s;eized irre&s;i&s;tibly on the heart. Of this kind was a &s;cene which pa&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes between a poor Engli&s;h woman and her dog, which &s;he had brought to keep her company in her captivity. She had been hou&s;e-keeper in a French family, and, &s;ome months before &s;he was impri&s;oned,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
had &s;ent her daughter, who was her only child, to her friends in England. The poor woman often exclaimed, while her face was bathed in tears, "Oh, Charlotte, Charlotte, I &s;hall never &s;ee you again!" Whenever the dog heard the name of Charlotte, he began to howl in &s;o me|lancholy a note that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;ympathi&s;e in his lamentation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t frightful circum&s;tance which attended our arre&s;tation were the vi&s;its of Henriot, the commandant of the mili|tary force of Paris. This wretch had been one of the executioners on the &s;e|cond of September, and was appointed by the commune of Paris on the 31&s;t of May to take the command of the na|tional guard, to point the cannon again&s;t the convention, to violate the repre&s;en|tation of the people, and to act the pre|lude of that dark drama of which France has been the de&s;olated &s;cene, and Europe the affrighted &s;pectator. Henriot per|formed
<PB N="29" REF="31">
his part &s;o much to the &s;atisfac|tion of his employers, that he was con|tinued in his command; and it was a part of his office to vi&s;it the pri&s;ons, and take ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e that they were properly guard|ed. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw him was the day after our confinement. He en|tered on a &s;udden our apartment, bran|di&s;hing his &s;word, and accompanied by twelve of his officers. There was &s;ome|thing in his look which did not give you &s;imply the idea of the ferocity which is &s;ometimes to be found among civilized Europeans: his fiercene&s;s &s;eemed to be of that kind which belongs to a cannibal of New Zealand; and he looked not merely as if he longed to plunge his &s;abre in our bo&s;oms, but to drink a libation of our blood. He poured forth a volley of oaths and imprecations, called out to know how many guillotines mu&s;t be erected for the Engli&s;h, and did not leave our chamber till one per&s;on who
<PB N="30" REF="32">
was pre&s;ent had fainted with terror. In this manner he vi&s;ited every apartment, &s;preading con&s;ternation and di&s;may; and the&s;e vi&s;its were repeated three or four times in a week. Whenever the tram|pling of his hor&s;e's feet was heard in the court-yard, the fir&s;t pri&s;oner who di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the well-known &s;ound gave the alarm, and in one moment the public room was cleared; every per&s;on flying with the precipitation of fear to his own apartment. Every noi&s;e was in&s;tantly hu&s;hed; a &s;tillne&s;s like that of death per|vaded the whole dwelling; and we re|mained crouching in our cells, like the Greeks in the cave of Polyphemus, till the mon&s;ter di&s;appeared. The vi&s;its of the admini&s;trators of police, though not &s;o terrific as tho&s;e of Henriot, were no|thing le&s;s than &s;oothing. Brutality, as well as terror, was the order of the day; and tho&s;e public functionaries, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s it was not only to &s;ee that the po|lice
<PB N="31" REF="33">
of the pri&s;on was well regulated, but al&s;o to hear if the pri&s;oners had any &s;ub|ject of complaint, u&s;ed to make the en|quiry in a tone of &s;uch ferocity, that, whatever oppre&s;&s;ions might hang on the heart, the lips lo&s;t the power of giving them utterance. The vi&s;its of the po|lice generally produced &s;ome additional rigour to our confinement; and in a &s;hort time all acce&s;s to us whatever was for|bidden except by letters, which were &s;ent open, and delivered to us after being ex|amined by the &s;entinels. There was &s;ometimes room for deep meditation on the &s;trange caprice and vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune. We found the ex-mini&s;ter Ame|lot a pri&s;oner in the Luxembourg; he, who during his admini&s;tration had di&s;tri|buted lettres de cachet with &s;o much liberality. Tyranny had now changed its in&s;truments, and he was become him|&s;elf the victim of de&s;poti&s;m with new
<PB N="32" REF="34" MS="y">
in&s;ignia: the <HI>blue ribband</HI> had given place to the <HI>red cap,</HI> and "de par le roi" was transformed into "par me&s;ure de &s;uret&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale." By his order La Tude, who&s;e hi&s;tory is &s;o well known, had been con|fined thirty years in the Ba&s;tille. He was now enjoying the &s;weets of liberty; and, before the pri&s;on-doors were &s;hut again&s;t &s;trangers, came frequently to vi&s;it &s;ome of his friends in the very room where the mini&s;ter was impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>Amelot, in a comfortable apartment and &s;urrounded by &s;ociety, did not bear his confinement with the &s;ame firmne&s;s as La Tude had borne the &s;olitude of his dungeon, cheered only by the plaintive &s;ounds of his flute of reeds. He was in a &s;hort time bereft of his rea&s;on; and, among the wanderings of his imagina|tion, u&s;ed to addre&s;s letters to all the kings of Europe and all the emigrant princes, inviting them to &s;umptuous re|pa&s;ts,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
to which he &s;ometimes propo&s;ed admitting the national convention, to &s;hew that he was above bearing malice.</P>
<P>Whenever any new pri&s;oners arrived, the re&s;t crowded around them, and ha&s;|tened to calm their minds by the mo&s;t &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy. Not &s;uch were the emotions excited by the appearance of Maillard, who was one of the murderers on the &s;econd of Septem|ber, and who had lately been appointed to a command in the revolutionary army; from which, for &s;ome malver&s;ations, he was now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;ent to pri&s;on, and or|dered into clo&s;e confinement. He had taken a very active part in the late tran&s;actions, and had, a few days before his own arre&s;t, conducted to pri&s;on two fine boys, who were the &s;ons of the ex-mini&s;ter La Tour du Pin, together with their governor, who was a prie&s;t. They were &s;tepping into a carriage, which was to convey them to &s;chool, when they were &s;eized upon
<PB N="34" REF="36">
by Maillard, who taking the younge&s;t, a child of eleven years of age, by the &s;houlder, &s;aid to him in a &s;tern accent, "Il faut dire la verit&eacute;, toute la verit&eacute;, et rien que la verit&eacute;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">You mu&s;t &s;peak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</NOTE>." No &s;ooner was Maillard brought into the anti-cham|ber, while his room was preparing, than the little boy recognized his acquaint|ance, and running up to him cried, "Bon jour, citoyen Maillard&mdash;il faut dire la verit&eacute;, toute la verit&eacute;, et rien que la ve|rit&eacute;."</P>
<P>Nothing could be more painful than the &s;en&s;ations excited by reading the evening papers, which the pri&s;oners were at this time permitted to receive, and which were expected with that trembling anxiety with which, under pre&s;ent evils, we long to look into the promi&s;es of fu|turity. The evening paper &s;eemed to
<PB N="35" REF="37">
us the book of our de&s;tiny; but there we could trace no &s;oothing characters of hope, or mercy. Every line was &s;tamped with con&s;piracy, vengeance, de&s;olation, and death; and the reading the events of the day left impre&s;&s;ions on our minds which often deprived us of &s;leep. We &s;ometimes quitted the crowd in the pub|lic room, and, &s;hutting our&s;elves up in our own apartment, endeavoured, amid&s;t the evils of this world, like Sterne's monk, to look beyond it. If &s;uch meditation was calculated to wipe away our tears, it &s;ometimes made them flow&mdash;"Let the &s;ighing of the pri&s;oner come before Thee: according to the greatne&s;s of Thy power, pre&s;erve Thou tho&s;e that are ap|pointed to die!"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE days of my captivity are often brought back to my remembrance, by circum&s;tances which &s;eem &s;ufficiently re|mote from &s;orrows; by that connexion of the pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, which Aken|&s;ide de&s;cribes &s;o beautifully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plea&s;ures of Imagination, book iii.</NOTE>: and you will perhaps think that my imagination is &s;omewhat di&s;ordered, when I tell you that the lake, from the luxuriant banks of which I &s;end you this letter, recalls to my mind our apartment in the pri&s;on. The walls of that apartment were hung with tape&s;try which de&s;cribed a land&s;cape of romantic beauty. On that land&s;cape I often gazed till I almo&s;t per&s;uaded my|&s;elf that the &s;cenery was alive around me,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
&s;o much did I delight in the plea&s;ing il|lu&s;ion. How often, while my eyes were fixed on that canva&s;s which led my wound|ed &s;pirit from the cruelty of man to the benignity of God&mdash;how often did I wi&s;h "for the wings of a dove, that I might flee away and be at re&s;t!" To be &s;eated at the foot of tho&s;e &s;heltering hills which embo&s;omed &s;ome mimic habitations, or beneath a mighty elm which ro&s;e ma|je&s;tically in the fore-ground of the piece, and &s;pread its thick foliage over a green &s;lope, appeared to me the &s;ummit of earthly felicity. Tho&s;e hills, the torrent|&s;tream which rolled down their &s;teep &s;ides, the &s;hady elm, and all the objects on the tape&s;try, are indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on my memory; and often when I am wander|ing through the charming &s;cenes of Swit|zerland, a country which nature &s;eems to have created more for ornament than u&s;e, where &s;he has &s;pread over every land&s;cape tho&s;e lavi&s;h graces which in

other regions belong only to a few fa|voured &s;pots, I have felt my eyes bathed in tears, while, amid&s;t views of overwhelm|ing greatne&s;s, &s;ome minute object un|ob&s;erved by others has led <HI>my</HI> imagination to the tape&s;try and the pri&s;on. A few days &s;ince I pa&s;&s;ed along the falls of the Te&s;&s;ino, rolling through narrow clif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s un|der rocks of the mo&s;t terrific form, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of torrents, &s;weeping after each other down the abrupt de&s;cent, and brok|en in their cour&s;e by enormous fragments torn from the cliffs; &s;ometimes rai&s;ing their &s;cattered &s;urges into thin air, and &s;ometimes di&s;playing the pri&s;matic co|lours on the foam. While I was &s;tand|ing on one of tho&s;e daring bridges that are thrown acro&s;s the gulph, and that tradition calls the work of &s;upernatural agency, after the fir&s;t tran&s;port of admira|tion, in which the mind lo&s;es all traces of the pa&s;t, or thought of the future, had &s;ub&s;ided, the torrent-rill which

<P>I have yet only given you a general outline of our pri&s;on; but there was one &s;cene of calamity which my&s;elf and my family were alone doomed to witne&s;s, and of which our fellow captives had no &s;hare. Our apartment, with two others adjoin|ing, was &s;eparated from the public room by a little pa&s;&s;age, and a door which the hui&s;&s;iers carefully locked at night. It
<PB N="40" REF="42">
happened that the&s;e apartments were then occupied by two per&s;ons in who&s;e &s;ociety we had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t agreeable hours of our re&s;idence in France. The&s;e per&s;ons were Sillery and La Source, two of the members of the convention, who had been long in clo&s;e confinement, and who were now on the point of appearing before th t &s;anguinary tribunal whence, after the mo&s;t &s;hocking mockery of ju&s;|tice, they were inhumanly dragged to the &s;caffold. Sillery, on account of his in|firmities, had with much difficulty ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion from the police for his &s;ervant to be admitted into the pri&s;on dur|ing the day, together with an old female friend, who, on the plea of his illne&s;s, had implored leave to attend him as his nur&s;e, with that eloquence which belongs to affliction, and which &s;ometimes even the mo&s;t hardened hearts are unable to re&s;i&s;t. While men a&s;&s;ume over our &s;ex &s;o many claims to &s;uperiority, let them
<PB N="41" REF="43">
at lea&s;t be&s;tow on us the palm of con|&s;tancy, and allow that in the fidelity of our attachments we have the right of pre-eminence. Tho&s;e pri&s;ons from which men &s;hrunk back with terror, and where they often left their friends abandoned left they &s;hould be involved in their fate&mdash;women, in whom the force of &s;en&s;ibility overcame the fears of female weakne&s;s, demanded and &s;ome|times obtained permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it, in de|fiance of all the dangers that &s;urrounded their gloomy walls. Sillery's friend and his &s;ervant being allowed to go in and out of his apartment, the door was not kept con&s;tantly locked, although he and La Source were clo&s;ely confined, and not permitted to have any communication with the other pri&s;oners. The &s;econd night of our abode in the Luxembourg, when the pri&s;oners had retired to their re|&s;pective chambers, and the keeper had locked the outer door which enclo&s;ed our three apartments, La Source entered our
<PB N="42" REF="44">
room. Oh! how different was this in|terview from tho&s;e meetings of &s;ocial en|joyment that were embelli&s;hed by the charms of his conver&s;ation, always di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a flow of eloquence, and animated by that enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour which peculiarly belonged to his charac|ter! La Source was a native of Langue|doc, and united with very &s;uperior ta|lents, that vivid warmth of imagination for which the &s;outhern provinces of France have been renowned &s;ince the period when, awakened by the genial in|fluence of tho&s;e luxuriant regions, the &s;ong of the Troubadours bur&s;t from the gloom of gothic barbari&s;m. Liberty in the &s;oul of La Source was le&s;s a princi|ple than a pa&s;&s;ion, for his bo&s;om beat high with philanthropy; and in his former &s;ituation as a prote&s;tant mini&s;ter he had felt in a peculiar manner the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the antient &s;y&s;tem. His &s;en&s;i|bility was acute, and his dete&s;tation of the crimes by which the revolution had
<PB N="43" REF="45">
been &s;ullied, was in proportion to his de|voted attachment to its cau&s;e. La Source was polite and amiable in his manners: he had a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, and a powerful voice; and &s;ung, as he conver&s;ed, with all the energy of feeling. After the day had pa&s;&s;ed in the fatigue of public debates, he was glad to lay a&s;ide the tumult of poli|tics in the evening, for the conver&s;ation of &s;ome literary men whom he met occa|&s;ionally at our tea-table. Ah, how little did we then fore&s;ee the horrors of that period when we &s;hould meet him in the gloom of a pri&s;on, a pro&s;cribed victim, with whom this melancholy interview was be&s;et with danger!</P>
<P>We were obliged to conver&s;e in whi&s;|pers, while we kept watch &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at the outer door, that if any &s;tep ap|proached he might in&s;tantly fly to his chamber. He had much to a&s;k, having been three months a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, and knowing little of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the
<PB N="44" REF="46">
world; and though he &s;eemed to forget all the horrors of his &s;ituation in the con|&s;olation he derived from the&s;e moments of confidential conver&s;ation, yet he fre|quently lamented, that this la&s;t gleam of plea&s;ure which was &s;hed over his ex|i&s;tence was purcha&s;ed at the price of our captivity. In the &s;olitude of his pri&s;on, no voice of friend&s;hip, no accents of pity had reached his ear; and after our ar|rival, he u&s;ed through the lonely day to count the hours till the pri&s;on-gates were clo&s;ed, till all was &s;till within its walls, and no &s;ound was heard without, except at intervals the hoar&s;e cry of the &s;enti|nels, when he ha&s;tened to our apartment. The di&s;covery of the&s;e vi&s;its would in|deed have expo&s;ed us to the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences; but our &s;ympathy pre|vailed over our fears; nor could we, what|ever might be the event, refu&s;e our de|voted friend this la&s;t melancholy &s;atisfac|tion. La Source at his &s;econd vi&s;it was
<PB N="45" REF="47">
accompanied by Sillery, the hu&s;band of Madame de Sillery who&s;e writings are &s;o well known in England. Sillery was about &s;ixty years of age; had lived freely, like mo&s;t men of his former rank in France; and from this di&s;&s;ipated life had more the appearance of age than belong|ed to his years. His manners retained the elegance, by which that cla&s;s was di&s;tingui&s;hed which Mr. Burke has de|nominated "the Corinthian capital of poli&s;hed &s;ociety." Sillery had a fine ta&s;te for drawing, and during his confinement di&s;played the powers of his pencil by tracing beautiful land&s;capes. He al&s;o amu&s;ed him&s;elf by reading hi&s;tory; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing con&s;iderable talents for litera|ture, had recorded with a rich warmth of colouring the events of the revolution, in which he had been a di&s;tingui&s;hed actor, and of which he had trea&s;ured up details precious for hi&s;tory. With keen regret he told me that he had committed
<PB N="46" REF="48">
&s;everal volumes of manu&s;cript to the flames, a &s;ad &s;acrifice to the Omars of the day.</P>
<P>The mind of Sillery was &s;omewhat le&s;s fortified again&s;t his approaching fate than that of La Source. The old man often turned back on the pa&s;t and wept, and &s;ometimes enquired with an anxious look, if we believed there was any chance of his deliverance. Alas! I have no words to paint the &s;en&s;ations of tho&s;e mo|ments!&mdash;To know that the days of our fellow captives were numbered&mdash;that they were doomed to peri&s;h&mdash;that the bloody tribunal before which they were going to appear, was but the path-way to the &s;caffold&mdash;to have the painful ta&s;k of &s;tifling our feelings, while we endea|voured to &s;ooth the weakne&s;s of humanity by hopes which we knew were fallacious, was a &s;pecies of mi&s;ery almo&s;t in&s;upport|able. There were moments indeed, when the ta&s;k became too painful to be en|dured;
<PB N="47" REF="49">
There were moments when, &s;hock|ed by &s;ome new incident of terror, this cruel re&s;traint gave way to uncontrolable emotion; when the tears, the &s;obbings of convul&s;ive angui&s;h would no longer be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and our unfortunate friends were obliged to give in&s;tead of receiving con&s;olation.</P>
<P>They had in their calamity that &s;up|port which is of all others the mo&s;t effec|tual under misfortune. Religion was in La Source a habit of the mind. Im|pre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas of the Supreme Being, although the ways of heaven never appeared more dark and intricate than in this triumph of guilt over innocence, he repo&s;ed with un|bounded confidence in that Providence in who&s;e hand are the i&s;&s;ues of life and death. Sillery, who had a feeling heart, found devotion the mo&s;t &s;oothing refuge of affliction. He and La Source com|po&s;ed together a little hymn adapted to a &s;weet &s;olemn air, which they called
<PB N="48" REF="50">
their evening &s;ervice. Every night be|fore we parted they &s;ung this &s;imple dirge in a low tone to prevent their being heard in the other apartments, which made it &s;eem more plaintive. Tho&s;e mournful founds, the knell of my departing friends, yet thrill upon my heart!</P>

<P>La Source often &s;poke of his wife with tender regret. He had been married only a week, when he was cho&s;en a member of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, and was obliged to ha&s;ten to Paris, while his wife remained in Languedoc to take care of an aged mother. When the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved, La Source was immediately elected a mem|ber of the national convention, and could find no interval in which to vi&s;it his native &s;pot, or his wife, whom he &s;aw
<PB N="51" REF="53">
no more. In his meditations on the chain of political events, he mentioned one little incident which &s;eemed to hang on his mind with a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious feeling. A few days after the 10th of Augu&s;t he dined in the fauxbourg of St. Antoine with &s;everal members of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, who were the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for their talents and patrioti&s;m. They were exulting in the birth of the new republic, and the glorious part they were to act as its founders, when a citi|zen of the fauxbourg, who had been in|vited to partake of the repa&s;t, ob&s;erved, that he feared a different de&s;tiny awaited them. "As you have been the founders of the republic," &s;aid he, "you will al&s;o be its victims. In a &s;hort time you will be obliged to impo&s;e re&s;traints and duties on the people, to whom your ene|mies and theirs will repre&s;ent you as hav|ing overthrown regal power only to e&s;|tabli&s;h your own. You will be accu&s;ed
<PB N="52" REF="54">
of ari&s;tocracy; and I fore&s;ee," he added with much perturbation, "that you will all peri&s;h on the &s;caffold." The com|pany &s;miled at his &s;ingular prediction: but during the en&s;uing winter, when the &s;torm was gathering over the political horizon, La Source recalled the pro|phecy, and &s;ometimes reminded Verg|niaud of the man of the fauxbourg St. Antoine. Vergniaud had little heeded the augur; but a few days previous to the 31&s;t of May, when the convention was for the fir&s;t time be&s;ieged, La Source &s;aid again to Vergniaud, "Well, what think you of the prophet of the faux|bourg?" "The prophet of the faux|bourg," an&s;wered Vergniaud, "was in the right."</P>
<P>The morning now arrived when La Source and Sillery, together with nineteen other members of the convention, were led before the revolutionary tribunal. When the guards who were to conduct them
<PB N="53" REF="55">
arrived, the other pri&s;oners crowded to the public room to &s;ee them pa&s;s, and we &s;hut our&s;elves up in our own apart|ment. They returned about five in the evening; &s;oon after which their coun&s;el arrived, and we had no opportunity of &s;eeing them till midnight, when they re|lated to us what had pa&s;&s;ed. The conduct of the judges and the a&s;pect of the jury were calculated to bani&s;h every gleam of hope from the bo&s;oms of the pri&s;oners; the former permitted with reluctance any thing to be urged in their defence, and the latter li&s;tened with impatience, ca&s;t|ing upon their victims looks of atrocity in which they might ea&s;ily read their fate: yet in &s;pite of the&s;e unhappy omens our friends returned from the tribunal with their minds much elevated. La Source de&s;cribed in his eloquent language the noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty, the ar|dent love of their country, the heroical contempt of death which animated his
<PB N="54" REF="56">
colleagues, whom he had not &s;een for &s;ome time, &s;ince they had been transferred to the Conciergerie, while him&s;elf and Sil|lery had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to remain at the Luxembourg upon the certificates of their phy&s;icians, that they were too ill to be removed without danger. La Source declared that ancient hi&s;tory of|fered no model of public virtue beyond that which was exhibited by his friends at the tribunal, and who in their pri&s;on, blending with the fortitude of Romans the gaiety of Frenchmen, and being confined in one apartment, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hort interval of life which was left in conver&s;ation, and cheerful repa&s;ts which were u&s;ually concluded with patriotic &s;ongs. "You," &s;aid Vergniaud to La Source when they met at the tribunal, "you perhaps will find &s;omething to re|gret in the lo&s;s of life. You have a glimp&s;e of the gardens of the Luxem|bourg, which may remind you that there
<PB N="55" REF="57">
is &s;omething beautiful in nature: but we who live in human &s;hambles, who every day &s;ee fre&s;h victims dragged to execu|tion, we are become &s;o familiarized with death, that we look on it with uncon|cern."</P>
<P>A few days before this &s;anguinary trial ended, the admini&s;tration of the police &s;ent orders that the Engli&s;h-women con|fined in the Luxembourg &s;hould be re+moved the next day to a convent in the fauxbourg St. Antoine. With what keen regret La Source and Sillery received this intelligence! A thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times they thanked us for the dangers we had ri&s;qued in receiving them, and for the &s;ympathy which had &s;oothed the la&s;t hours of their exi&s;tence&mdash;a thou&s;and times they declared, that if it were yet po&s;&s;ible their lives might be pre|&s;erved, they &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves for ever bound to us by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties of gratitude and friend&s;hip: but they
<PB N="56" REF="58">
felt, alas! how &s;mall was the chance that we &s;hould meet again in this world. Sillery cut off a lock of his white hairs, which he begged I would pre&s;erve for his &s;ake, and La Source gave me the &s;ame relick. They embraced us with much emotion. They prayed that the ble&s;&s;ing of God might be upon us: we mingled our tears together, and parted to meet no more!&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me, before I conduct you to our new pri&s;on, give you a &s;hort ac|count of the political events and their cau&s;es, which, after bringing tho&s;e mem|bers of the convention to the &s;caffold who were mo&s;t fitted by their talents to defend liberty, and by their moral qua|lities to make it beloved, ended in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of cruelty and crimes, that it can be only by a long per&s;everance in public virtue that France can make re|paration to humanity, or retrieve her character among the nations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE republican party of the legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;embly had, it is well known, very early projected many alterations in the new con&s;titution. They had ob&s;erved with great inquietude the changes which had taken place at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;embly, when its labours un|derwent a revi&s;ion previou&s;ly to the ac|ceptance of the con&s;titution by the ex|ecutive power, and when they found that tho&s;e who had hitherto been the mo&s;t &s;trenuous opponents of the court &s;uddenly became its mo&s;t zealous advocates and friends.</P>
<P>Though this party formed the minority of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, its influence by means of the popular &s;ocieties was very exten&s;ive. But when the &s;truggle took place between the court and the republi|can
<PB N="58" REF="60">
party, both of which were at length agreed in the overthrow of the new con|&s;titution, with which each was for dif|ferent rea&s;ons equally di&s;&s;atisfied, the party was joined by many who in this de&s;truction of the regal authority had no other end in view than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their own.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety of the Jacobins, which had been for a long time the rival and at length the conqueror of the throne, was de&s;erted immediately after the victory by almo&s;t all tho&s;e who had contributed to gain it. They imagined that every dome&s;tic enemy was annihilated when the fir&s;t decree of the convention changed the monarchy into a republic; and though &s;ymptoms of di&s;content di&s;covered them&s;elves among &s;ome who thought that the change had been too ha&s;tily decided on, and &s;ymp|toms of a more dangerous and fatal tendency to the welfare of the govern|ment had already appeared among others, yet tho&s;e to whom the people had given
<PB N="59" REF="61">
their confidence were not &s;ufficiently aware of the in&s;tability of popular favour, and the precarious tenure by which they held it. The commune of Paris claimed an equal right to &s;hare with the Jacobins the honours of the triumph over royalty; but di&s;&s;atisfied with the little credit given to the &s;ervices it had rendered during the &s;truggle, it took advantage of the imbeci|lity of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly then ex|piring, and had already erected it&s;elf into a rival power before the convention had opened its fir&s;t debates. The pretence of making extraordinary exertions to op|po&s;e the march of the enemy towards Paris had led the commune, amid&s;t a multiplicity of other acts of rebellion, to arrogate the functions of the repre&s;enta|tives of the people; and having at the fatal period of the ma&s;&s;acre of September humbled the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly to the du&s;t, they thought that the &s;ame daring conduct would give them the &s;ame &s;upe|riority
<PB N="60" REF="62">
over the national convention. But in this calculation they were deceived. Robe&s;pierre and his adherents, who had hitherto directed their coun&s;els, now a&s;|pired to higher de&s;tinies; and, though &s;olicitous to make the commune an auxi|liary in their de&s;igns, were unwilling that it &s;hould become their rival. In the new election of repre&s;entatives, all tho&s;e were excluded who had been influenced by the court, or who had oppo&s;ed from purer motives the republican party. Al|though this party gained a con&s;iderable reinforcement by the new election, yet the dread of returning royalty, with all the &s;everity of the old &s;y&s;tem, had ope|rated &s;o powerfully on the minds of the people of the departments, that many de|puties were cho&s;en who&s;e preten&s;ions to this tru&s;t aro&s;e more from the &s;trength of their lungs than of their talents, and who&s;e harangues made up in noi&s;e what they wanted in argument; while the &s;till
<PB N="61" REF="63">
greater dread of the return of tho&s;e hor|rors which the commune had ju&s;t been exerci&s;ing had &s;o intimidated the citizens of Paris, that a part of their deputation to the convention, at the head of which was Robe&s;pierre, triumphing over the fears they had excited, took their &s;eats rather as the conquerors than the repre&s;entatives of the people. The conduct of the officers of the municipality, however, called aloud for puni&s;hment. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the convention to &s;uffer the crimes they had committed, and the &s;till greater atro|cities which they had meditated, to pa&s;s unnoticed. The council-general of the commune were called to the bar, but e&s;|caped ju&s;tice by di&s;&s;embled profe&s;&s;ions of repentance, and the promi&s;e of delivering up tho&s;e who had led them to the com|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch enormities. Had the con|vention, while its rival was thus &s;ub|dued, proceeded to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e who had been the chiefs of the con|&s;piracy
<PB N="62" REF="64">
and tho&s;e who had been the dupes of their impo&s;ture, they would have done a great act of national ju&s;tice, and would have cru&s;hed any farther attempts again&s;t the national honour. But as this humi|liation of the commune was a contrivance to e&s;cape examination, of which the con|&s;pirators who directed its operations, and who had been cho&s;en &s;ince to the con|vention, were afraid; the a&s;&s;embly, de|ceived by this artifice, had no &s;ooner granted the pardon they implored, than the faction, emboldened by impunity, perceived that with audacity and per&s;e|verance they might yet attain the end to which they a&s;pired. While Robe&s;pierre &s;at in the commune, his object was pro|bably to frame a government of munici|palities, of which Paris was to be the chief, and him&s;elf the dictator: but this enter|pri&s;e being encompa&s;&s;ed with difficulty, &s;ince the people had determined to have a national convention, he afterwards
<PB N="63" REF="65">
changed his mea&s;ures, and began to me|ditate a plan of making the convention it&s;elf, of which he was now a member, &s;erve as the in&s;trument of his u&s;urpa|tion.</P>
<P>With this view, he and his di&s;organiz|ing faction in the convention a&s;&s;umed the direction of the municipality; and as the &s;ociety of the Jacobins was de&s;erted by the republicans, who thought its &s;ervices no longer nece&s;&s;ary, the name and the place were &s;eized on by the con&s;pirators, and filled with intriguing and ambitious men, who&s;e hopes of &s;haring in the plun|der or the power induced them to be|come accomplices in the guilt.</P>
<P>While the municipality laboured to win over the &s;ections of Paris, the Jaco|bins made pro&s;elytes to their &s;y&s;tem of anarchy by their affiliations and corre|&s;pondence in the departments; and before the exi&s;ting government was fully aware of the extent of the con&s;piracy, or could
<PB N="64" REF="66">
collect &s;ufficient energy to counteract it, the faction had gained a mo&s;t alarming a&s;cendency; and although they formed a very &s;mall minority in the convention, their influence both in the executive part of the government and among&s;t the con|&s;tituted authorities was &s;ufficient to out|weigh that of the repre&s;entation it&s;elf. Every conce&s;&s;ion made to the con&s;pirators &s;erved only to increa&s;e the in&s;olence of their demands; and although the mo&s;t eloquent members of the convention, Guadet, Vergniaud, Pethion, Louvet, Bri&s;&s;ot and La Source gave ince&s;&s;ant warnings of the progre&s;s of the anarchi&s;ts towards the di&s;&s;olution of all order in the &s;tate, yet like Ca&s;&s;andra they were believed only when the prophecies were fulfilled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Yes," &s;ays La Source, "there exi&s;ts a faction, which &s;eeks to cru&s;h the convention and rai&s;e the dictator&s;hip on its ruins. This is the faction which has i&s;&s;ued its arbitrary mandates, which has ordered the arre&s;t of eight of my colleagues who &s;at in the le|gi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, which has paid robbers to plunder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder, and which has had the au|dacity to lay to the charge of the people the crimes which it&s;elf has perpetrated. Were I in going from this place to fall under the poniards of the&s;e traitors, I &s;hould die &s;atisfied in having lifted up the veil which conceals them: a little longer and I will unma&s;k them altogether." Guadet often detailed the con&s;pi|racy of the Jacobins and the municipality, and, with bur&s;ts of hone&s;t indignation again&s;t the&s;e &s;hamele&s;s traitors, implored the convention to &s;ave the republic by di&s;&s;olving the &s;ociety and re-electing the commune. Vergniaud with more than u&s;ual eloquence pour|trayed the con&s;pirators. Louvet gave a clear and admirable detail of their attempts to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the convention in the con&s;piracy of the 10th of March; and Bri&s;&s;ot unveiled their trea&s;on not only in the convention and in his journal, but in different pub|lications, of which his addre&s;s to his con&s;tituents pub|li&s;hed in May 1793 will furni&s;h intere&s;ting matter for hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">

<PB N="66" REF="68">
regrets we feel for tho&s;e virtuous friends of liberty who fell the victims of their rage, the hi&s;torian, more impartial than the friend, will not fail to animadvert on the negligence of which in &s;ome in&s;tances they were guilty, and above all in care|le&s;sly throwing a&s;ide, by the de&s;ertion of the Jacobin &s;ociety, the means which they had obtained of informing the public mind and directing its will.</P>
<P>But before we carry our cen&s;ures too far, we mu&s;t recollect that they had to con|tend again&s;t men hardened in crimes and inacce&s;&s;ible to &s;hame, who found refuge from the detection of their guilt in the protection of their party, and who re|turned the thunder of the patriots in the convention by their noi&s;y vociferations at the Jacobins and the commune.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt made on the national repre&s;entation by the commune of Paris and the Jacobins, ought to have been puni&s;hed as an act of rebellion again&s;t the
<PB N="67" REF="69">
&s;overeignty of the people. But an ill|judged application of the principles of individual liberty, a too delicate regard for the rights of per&s;ons, led on the ma|jority of the convention to the permi&s;|&s;ion of offences, of which they took no mea&s;ures to &s;top the progre&s;s, till the con|&s;piracy had acquired &s;uch &s;trength as made every exertion again&s;t it ineffectual.</P>
<P>The trea&s;on of Dumourier had furni&s;h|ed the faction with new re&s;ources for ca|lumny again&s;t the republican party, with &s;ome of whom he had formerly been con|nected: for, as the faction was in the con|&s;tant habit of denouncing indi&s;criminate|ly every agent of the republic, the com|pletion of one prophecy gave an air of credit to the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The con&s;pirators accu&s;ed the republicans of be|ing accomplices in Dumourier's trea&s;on: the repub|licans have retorted the charge on &s;ome of their ad|ver&s;aries with the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable evidence. But we need not here recur to con&s;piracies either of Jacobins or Girondi&s;ts to di&s;cern the motives of Du|mourier's conduct. He has endeavoured to ex|plain it him&s;elf in his memoirs; to which if any cre|dit ought to be given, the Girondi&s;ts will be ab|&s;olved from all &s;hare in his trea&s;on. But their inno|cence in this re&s;pect, as well as their political inte|grity in every other, is now e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the reach of calumny and detraction.</NOTE>. Although the con|&s;pirators
<PB N="68" REF="70">
had acquired con&s;iderable in|fluence from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance given them by the commune and the Jacobins, they perceived that the object which they had in view, would never fully be attained till they had gained &s;o ab&s;olute a controul over the convention, as to make it, like the ancient parliaments, the regi&s;terers of their imperial edicts. To this end all their efforts were directed: but while tho&s;e men &s;till &s;at within its walls who&s;e virtue and eloquence had hitherto warded off the blow which menaced their coun|try, there was little hope of &s;ucce&s;s. The prize &s;et before the&s;e traitors was too great
<PB N="69" REF="71">
to &s;uffer them to he&s;itate about the means of &s;eizing it; and having thrown a&s;ide all regard to the laws, all re&s;pect for in|dividual or political liberty, they con|ceived the project of violating the na|tional repre&s;entation it&s;elf, and tearing from it the mo&s;t eloquent and intrepid defenders of its rights. To carry their plot into execution, it was nece&s;&s;ary to cover it with the veil of the wi&s;h of the people, of whom a few hired de&s;peradoes and other ignorant and &s;educed per&s;ons be|came the repre&s;entatives, bearing peti|tions written by the con&s;pirators them|&s;elves, praying the convention to drive from their &s;eats a certain number whom they marked as unworthy of their confi|dence or that of the nation. The indig|nation of the convention being rou&s;ed at the&s;e attempts, they in&s;tituted a com|mi&s;&s;ion of enquiry to &s;earch into the cau&s;es of this con&s;piracy. This com|mi&s;&s;ion, in pur&s;uance of the powers it had
<PB N="70" REF="72">
received, after mature examination, ar|re&s;ted Hebert, one of the municipal chiefs, and gave notice to the convention that they were prepared to make their report. The con&s;pirators &s;eeing that their crimes were on the point of being brought to light, the di&s;covery of which would an|nihilate their project, threw off the ma&s;k, and brought forward the commune of Paris to demand not only the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the commi&s;&s;ion which the convention had created, but the arre&s;tation of the members who compo&s;ed it, together with the twenty-two deputies of the conven|tion the mo&s;t eminent for their virtue and talents. The convention for &s;eve|ral days with&s;tood every effort that was made to &s;hake its firmne&s;s. The pre&s;i|dent I&s;nard, with all the warmth of ho|ne&s;t indignation, threatened in the name of the republic the liberticide factioners of the commune, that if they dared to proceed to the execution of tho&s;e de&s;igns
<PB N="71" REF="73">
which their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures indicated, if the national repre&s;entation &s;hould be violated by any of tho&s;e con&s;piracies of which they had been the accomplices, that Paris &s;hould be blotted out from the re&s;t of its cities, and that the traveller &s;hould wander on the banks of the Seine enquiring where it once &s;tood.</P>
<P>The chiefs of the con&s;piracy had pro|ceeded too far to be &s;topped in their ca|reer by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e; but they found more intrepidity and firmne&s;s in the convention than they expected, and therefore determined to employ their la&s;t expedient. The ringing of the toc&s;in and the firing of alarm guns had excited the attention of the citizens of Paris for two days, when on the third the beating to arms informed them that they were going to be put into in&s;urrec|tion. The national guard being thus put into in&s;urrection, the cau&s;e of which was unknown, the whole body were con|ducted
<PB N="72" REF="74">
to the hall of the convention, where Henriot the commander of the military force, who had been created by the con&s;pirators for that purpo&s;e, had ordered them to a&s;&s;emble. The conven|tion was &s;urrounded till nearly midnight by the military force, nor was any mem|ber permitted to leave the hall; but although be&s;ieged the a&s;&s;embly was not yet conquered. The day pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t frightful tumult, and Rabaut de St. Etienne in vain &s;tood at the tribune, holding in his hand the report of the commi&s;&s;ion of twelve upon the con&s;pi|racy of the commune, together with the proofs of its authenticity. His voice was lo&s;t in the horrible vociferations of the tribunes, and the murmurs of the faction within the hall. At length, find|ing all his efforts ineffectual, he left the a&s;&s;embly in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ault of the convention on the 31&s;t of May, though it had produced
<PB N="73" REF="75">
the mo&s;t horrible di&s;order, had not forced from the a&s;&s;embly the decree of arre&s;ta|tion. But Robe&s;pierre with his com|mune, his Jacobins, and his body guard of revolutionary women, who were in the van of the attack, and &s;tood in the pa&s;&s;ages of the convention armed with poniards, which they pointed at the bo&s;oms of &s;uch of the deputies as at|tempted to leave the hall, had gone too far to recede. The fir&s;t of June they employed in preparations for a fre&s;h at|tack; and on the &s;econd again the toc&s;in rung, again the whole city was under arms, and the convention was again in|ve&s;ted by &s;ixty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>It does not appear that all the adhe|rents of the con&s;pirators, or rather the different factions in league with them, were acquainted with all the means which Robe&s;pierre, Marat, and the mu|nicipality, the original authors of the plot, meant to employ. La Croix, a
<PB N="74" REF="76">
member of the mountain, who had been repul&s;ed in endeavouring to go out of the hall, prote&s;ted with vehemence again&s;t this violation of their liberties; and when Henriot, in receiving orders from the pre&s;ident to draw off his troops, re|plied, that as &s;oon as he had executed the orders of the people he would obey tho&s;e of the convention, and threatened that if they refu&s;ed to deliver up to ju&s;|tice the twenty-two deputies whom he called traitors, he would order the can|non to be fired on the hall; Danton with great indignation imprecated vengeance on the head of the ruffian, which &s;ome months after, at the period of his own fall, was in the act of accu&s;ation alleged again&s;t him as a crime. In vain did the convention, partaking Danton's indigna|tion, hope to obtain their liberty by de|creeing that the officers of the po&s;t next the entrance of the hall &s;hould be called to the bar. Two of them had received
<PB N="75" REF="77">
no orders, and a third informed them that he was him&s;elf con&s;igned by a few &s;trangers who did not appear to him ac|quainted even with military forms. The&s;e &s;trangers were ordered to the bar; but they refu&s;ed to attend: and thus this a&s;|&s;embly, which talked of nothing le&s;s than bringing princes and kings in chains to their feet, were made pri&s;oners in their very &s;anctuary by a few hirelings, of whom no other de&s;cription was given than that they were &s;trangers and wore mu&s;taches. This was an indignity not to be borne. The pre&s;ident, therefore, propo&s;ed that the a&s;&s;embly in a body &s;hould go out of the hall: this was decreed, and the &s;en|tinels &s;eeing them&s;elves likely to be over|powered gave way. The deputies pa|raded in the garden, expecting every mo|ment to be ma&s;&s;acred; but the con&s;pira|tors who directed their motions led them back again to the hall, ob&s;erving that the convention, after &s;o &s;triking a proof,

<P>Previou&s;ly to this mock parade, Bar|rere, who had been weighing the proba|bilities of &s;ucce&s;s on either &s;ide, and ex|amining which party would have the a&s;cendency, at length invited the pro|&s;cribed deputies, for the &s;ake of peace and for the good of the &s;tate, to &s;ubmit, and devote them&s;elves to their country. To this admonition three of them ac|ceded; but Barbaroux a&s;&s;erted, that he had no right to give in his dimi&s;&s;ion, nor could he obey any other mandate than that of the people, who having inve&s;ted him with the power had alone the right to take it from him. With more ve|hemence Lanjuinais exclaimed, that he would remain at his po&s;t to his late&s;t breath, or till he was torn from it by force. His intrepidity provoked the con&s;pirators to rage and tumult. "Ci|tizens," &s;aid he, "we have beheld in
<PB N="77" REF="79">
barbarous countries the people leading human victims to the altar, after crown|ing them with flowers; but we never heard, that the prie&s;ts who were about to &s;acrifice them treated them with in|&s;ult. I repeat, that I have no right to lay a&s;ide the augu&s;t character with which the people have honoured me; therefore, expect from me neither &s;elf-dimi&s;&s;ion, nor voluntary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion for a moment." This courageous reply to their fury ap|palled the tyrants; and had Vergniaud, Rabaut, Bri&s;&s;ot, and others who&s;e names were in the con&s;pirators' li&s;t, been then at their po&s;t, had they &s;econded their pro|&s;cribed colleagues at this critical moment with the thunder of their eloquence, the project of the con&s;pirators might ea&s;ily have been defeated, and they might have &s;aved both them&s;elves and the re|public. While the con&s;pirators were perpetrating this abominable deed, they were deliberating in the hou&s;e of Guadet
<PB N="78" REF="80">
about the means that &s;hould be taken to avoid it, and deceived by a report which a friend unhappily ill-informed conveyed to them, that the blood of their col|leagues was flowing; and believing it to be too late to make any farther &s;truggle, they &s;uffered the decree of arre&s;tation to be carried without oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Louvet relates the following &s;ingular anecdote: "We began to breathe again, when a man of Bourdeaux, who had been made pri&s;oner at the bat|tle of Nerwinden, and afterwards exchanged, related to Guadet, his friend, that having had an oppor|tunity of forming an intimate acquaintance with one of the officers of the imperial army, he had learned from him that Cobourg's &s;taff-officers flat|tered them&s;elves that in a &s;hort &s;pace of time <HI>twenty-two heads</HI> would fall in the convention. Guadet related to me this anecdote, with which we amu&s;ed our&s;elves; but judge of our &s;urpri&s;e, and the re|flections to which it gave ri&s;e, when &s;ome time after M.

<P>The tidings of the in&s;urrection in Pa|ris
<PB N="85" REF="87">
occa&s;ioned much fermentation in the departments, who were expected to have demanded of the Pari&s;ians, in a manner more &s;erious than by addre&s;s or remon|&s;trance, why the repre&s;entatives whom they had committed to their re&s;pect and protection were retained as pri&s;oners and regarded as traitors. The Pari&s;ians, who had been altogether pa&s;&s;ive during this &s;truggle, were not much moved by the&s;e menaces. They had beheld with indif|ference the progre&s;s of the conte&s;t. Find|ing them&s;elves delivered from the oppre&s;|&s;ion of the former government; conclud|ing that no tyrant exi&s;ted except &s;uch as bore the name of king; and per&s;uaded that that &s;y&s;tem could never return, they were carele&s;s whether the plain or the mountain, the c&ocirc;t&eacute; droit or c&ocirc;t&eacute; gauche held the reins of government. This fatal error has been the &s;ource of almo&s;t all the evils that have de&s;olated the repub|lic; for had the Pari&s;ians attended to the
<PB N="86" REF="88">
political duties that were required of them in exchange for their enjoyment of political rights, they would never have &s;een their fellow-citizens dragged daily through their &s;treets to the &s;caffold, at the nod of tyrants whom they ought early to have cru&s;hed.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this con&s;piracy, the a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;ections where the citizens met to deliberate on public af|fairs, were either filled by the agents of the con&s;pirators, or governed by the con&s;pirators them&s;elves; and where nei|ther of them had weight &s;ufficient to mi&s;|lead the citizens, they took advantage of their departure to propo&s;e and carry re&s;o|lutions among them&s;elves, which they proclaimed as the voice of the &s;ection. Though the&s;e practices were denounced in the convention, and though &s;ometimes the &s;ection of to-day came to di&s;claim what the &s;ame &s;ection of ye&s;terday had &s;aid, yet the di&s;covery of the fraud had
<PB N="87" REF="89">
no tendency to awaken the citizens to greater vigilance. Had they known to what end all the artifices of the con&s;pira|tors tended, they would undoubtedly have been on their guard; but as they were made to &s;erve the views of the trai|tors in demanding the expul&s;ion of their re|pre&s;entatives, without believing that they had committed any crime; &s;o they were al&s;o made the in&s;truments of con&s;ummat|ing the trea&s;on by a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the violation of the repre&s;entation it&s;elf in the arbi|trary arre&s;t of the deputies, without knowing for what rea&s;on they were armed and a&s;&s;embled. A long and mournful experience has at length &s;hewn them, that it is not &s;ufficient to feel the love of li|berty without making continual efforts to pre&s;erve it; that &s;o many and various are the enemies which it has to combat before its reign can be permanently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, that as much vigilance is requir|ed to guard it from the inroads of the
<PB N="88" REF="90">
a&s;piring demagogue, as courage to &s;hake off the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m; and that when the &s;acred code of freedom is violated in one point it leads to the de&s;truction of the whole. When the nobles whom the law had confounded in the cla&s;s of citi|zens were per&s;ecuted as a <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> when men of &s;uperior abilities became pro&s;cribed for "ari&s;tocracy of talents," tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for neither deceived them&s;elves in believing they were &s;afe.</P>
<P>Although the citizens remained un|moved at the&s;e violations, a con&s;iderable number of the departments felt the in|dignity, and prepared to avenge the na|tional honour. Some made eloquent remon&s;trances at the bar of the conven|tion; &s;ome deliberated on the convocation of the primary a&s;&s;emblies; &s;ome propo&s;|ed &s;ending no farther contributions to Paris, while others took arms to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion of the commune again&s;t the republic. For &s;ome time the arrival
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of the departmental force was expected; but the con&s;pirators, who fore&s;aw this formidable oppo&s;ition to the accompli&s;h|ment of their de&s;igns, had the prudence to provide again&s;t it by &s;ending previ|ou&s;ly into the departments as many of their emi&s;&s;aries as they could &s;pare with|out weakening their force at home, taken partly from among their accomplices in the convention, who carried with them the importance of repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators had al&s;o the advan|tage of being inve&s;ted with the authority of government, as they had &s;eized on the machine. They had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the convention, who were compelled to fol|low the impul&s;e already given them; they were proprietors of the national wealth, and had the armies at their command. The departments, on the contrary, had no central point of union except the com|mon indignation which the conduct of
<PB N="90" REF="92">
the con&s;pirators had excited. They had no trea&s;ure at their di&s;po&s;al but what aro&s;e from voluntary contributions; and while they were deliberating what &s;teps they &s;hould pur&s;ue, the con&s;pirators, clothed with the national power which they had u&s;urped, reduced the depart|ments to the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ubjection as they had the convention and Paris. In the we&s;tern departments, where &s;ome of the deputies who were accu&s;ed had fled, and around whom the people had crowd|ed partaking their indignation, the ar|mies that had ha&s;tily a&s;&s;embled as &s;ud|denly di&s;appeared; and the whole of the republic except the city of Lyons &s;ub|mitted to the yoke. The cau&s;es of this defection, which have hitherto been in|volved in ob&s;curity, it being the intere&s;t of the con&s;pirators to keep them conceal|ed from the world, have lately been de|veloped by one of the principal actors in tho&s;e memorable &s;cenes, Louvet, de|puty
<PB N="91" REF="93">
of the department of the Loiret, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early in the con|vention by his accu&s;ation of Robe&s;pierre, who unma&s;ked the con&s;piracy of the 10th of March, and who on the 31&s;t of May was honourably pro&s;cribed, but is now re&s;tored to his friends and his coun|try. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe his own words.</P>
<P>"Guadet and my&s;elf reached Caen on the 26th of June. On the 5th of the &s;ame month eight departments, namely, five of the former province of Brittany and three of Normandy, had entered into a common league. They had ju&s;t &s;ent their commi&s;&s;aries to Caen, and their troops were at the point of arriving. Wimpfen, the general of the whole force, had hitherto confined all his exploits to travelling about and talking, and under the mo&s;t frivolous pretences delayed every kind of organi&s;ation. As &s;oon as I &s;aw him I was convinced that he was a deter|mined royali&s;t, for he took no pains to
<PB N="92" REF="94">
conceal it. I a&s;ked Barbaroux and Bu|zot what they could expect from &s;uch a man, for the &s;upport of our cau&s;e. One of them an&s;wered me, that Wimpfen was a man of honour, and incapable of break|ing his engagements, and the other was altogether captivated by his agreeable manners. Guadet and Pethion, who had ju&s;t arrived, did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> my apprehen|&s;ions. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at my readi|ne&s;s in &s;u&s;pecting every one that was not as much a republican as my&s;elf. From that time I &s;aw that every thing was go|ing the &s;ame way at Caen as it had done at Paris. Wimpfen was beloved by the Normans; he had a con&s;iderable party among the admini&s;trators of Calvados, and had gained the confidence of the Bretons. In order to take the command from him, it was nece&s;&s;ary to unite and make u&s;e of all our exertions; but I found my&s;elf altogether un&s;upported. Every thing therefore was likely to fail on the &s;ide of
<PB N="93" REF="95">
the republic. Be&s;ides, many Normans, who &s;hewed the mo&s;t favourable di&s;po&s;i|tions towards us, becau&s;e in the credit of the news-papers they believed us to be royali&s;ts, changed their conduct in the mo&s;t pointed manner when by our con|ver&s;ation, and particularly by our actions, they came to know us better. My fir&s;t hopes were directed therefore towards the &s;outh. If my wife had been at Caen, we &s;hould have gone aboard &s;ome ve&s;&s;el at Honfleur bound to Bourdeaux; and as it would have been very ea&s;y for us to have &s;een whether things went no bet|ter there than el&s;ewhere, we &s;hould have taken our pa&s;&s;age aboard the fir&s;t Ame|rican ve&s;&s;el, and have been at this time &s;afe in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>"Three weeks elap&s;ed, while Wimp|fen did nothing but lead to Evreux the two thou&s;and men who had come up from the different departments. In the mean time report had &s;o &s;welled this little
<PB N="94" REF="96">
troop, that it was &s;aid at Paris to be thirty thou&s;and &s;trong. At this period, the patriots there had recovered from their fears, &s;poke their opinions pub|licly, and were preparing to overthrow the terrible municipality. Many &s;ec|tions had already &s;ent their commi&s;&s;aries to Evreux, who had carried back to Paris different publications explanatory of our true &s;entiments, and particularly a piece which they called, but I know not for what rea&s;on, Wimpfen's Mani|fe&s;to, and which was a declaration of the commi&s;&s;aries of the united departments; a declaration which I had compo&s;ed with great labour, which breathed only peace, fraternity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Pari&s;ians, but open war and exemplary puni&s;h|ment to &s;ome of the mountain, to the municipality and the cordeliers; and this ju&s;t di&s;tinction had produced the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible effect in Paris. The com|mi&s;&s;aries be&s;ides had &s;een and borne
<PB N="95" REF="97">
their te&s;timonies again&s;t the ba&s;e calum|nies which had been uttered again&s;t this departmental army, when it was accu&s;ed of having worn the white cockade, and expre&s;&s;ed its wi&s;h for royalty. Every thing in &s;hort was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that if, at this moment, our arms had met but with the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, the revolution would have been effected in Paris, without the interpo&s;ition of the departmental army; but it was not in this kind of &s;ucce&s;s that Wimpfen was intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>"The mountain under great apprehen|&s;ions had at length rai&s;ed in Paris 1800 foot &s;oldiers, the better half of which were praying for our &s;ucce&s;s, and al&s;o &s;even or eight hundred ruffians as cow|ardly as they were thievi&s;h: this collec|tion had ju&s;t entered Vernon. Then it was that Wimpfen talked of attacking this town; and here &s;uddenly a Mr. Puy|&s;ey, of whom we had never heard, was in|troduced to us by the general, as an of|ficer
<PB N="96" REF="98">
full of republicani&s;m and know|ledge. He it was whom Wimpfen or|dered to attack Vernon, and certainly he very well obeyed his &s;ecret in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>"In order to &s;urpri&s;e the enemy, he went out in open day with drums beating. He marched during the ex|treme heat, and then made his &s;ol|diers, who had no tents, and who for the greater part had never been in a camp, pa&s;s the night in the open air. He lo&s;t the whole of the following day in attacking a &s;mall ca&s;tle, which he had the honour of taking. The enemy having by this time been well and duly informed of all his manoeuvres, he, in order to give them &s;till greater advantage, made his troops halt at the entrance of a wood a league di&s;tant from Vernon; placed his cannon one piece behind the other along a wall; left all his little army in the greate&s;t di&s;order; did not even place &s;entinels; and went to &s;leep
<PB N="97" REF="99">
at a cottage at half a league from the place. An hour after, a few hundred men &s;uddenly made their appearance, who &s;urpri&s;ed our men and fired three rounds of grape &s;hot; but the guns in all pro|bability were charged only with powder, for there is no doubt that it was but a farce well arranged. However that may be, a rout took place immediately among the &s;oldiers, who did not know with what numbers they had to engage, who could &s;carcely find their arms, and who were looking about in vain for their commander. This was &s;o expeditious a retreat, that, had it not been for the brave &s;oldiers of the department of the I&s;le and Vilaine, who &s;tood their ground for &s;ome little time, not a &s;ingle field piece would have been &s;aved. In &s;hort, not a man received the &s;lighte&s;t wound: the enemy did not advance thirty &s;teps to follow up their ea&s;y victory. This adventure did not hinder Mr. Puy&s;ay, whom the
<PB N="98" REF="100">
admini&s;tration of the department of the Eure entreated not to abandon them, from declaring that Evreux was not tenable; and in reality the next day he withdrew him&s;elf &s;ixteen leagues, without &s;triking a blow, and abandoned a whole depart|ment to the enemy.</P>
<P>"On the arrival of the courier who brought us the&s;e &s;ad tidings, Wimpfen did not appear at all di&s;concerted. He more|over a&s;&s;ured us that there was nothing unfortunate in this event: he talked of fortifying Caen, of declaring the city in a &s;tate of defence, of organizing an army &s;omewhat &s;tronger, and of making pa|per-money which &s;hould be current throughout the &s;even united depart|ments.</P>
<P>"The&s;e ob&s;ervations afforded room for deep reflection. Salles and my&s;elf, after having a long time conver&s;ed on the &s;ub+ject, were convinced that the general, &s;o far from wi&s;hing to march to Paris,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
intended to keep us &s;hut up with him in the city, where his party was prevalent, to e&s;tabli&s;h a communication with En|gland, and to commit us with that power if it were po&s;&s;ible; in fine, to make u&s;e of us according to circum&s;tances, either to make his peace with the mountain if the coalition of the &s;outhern departments &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, or make his peace with the republicans if they &s;hould overthrow the mountain. Our colleagues, to whom we communicated our &s;u&s;picions, thought us vi&s;ionaries, and nothing le&s;s was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to convince them than what hap|pened &s;oon after.</P>
<P>"The general reque&s;ted to have a con|ference with all of us who were deputies, on an affair of the greate&s;t con&s;equence. He began by de&s;cribing to us our &s;itua|tion as very critical, unle&s;s we took &s;ome vigorous re&s;olution. He was going to Li&s;ieux to organi&s;e his army, and to form his camp in &s;uch a manner as to make
<PB N="100" REF="102">
at lea&s;t for &s;ome time a proper defence. The future, however, required &s;ome|thing more permanent. He returned back to his projects re&s;pecting (aen, to his propo&s;als about the creation of paper money, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and as he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his rea&s;oning by terror, though he ought to have known that &s;uch a mode of proceeding would have little influence on men accu&s;tomed to brave daily the fury and the mur|derers of the mountain, an officer, who undoubtedly had been in&s;tructed, &s;ud|denly entered, and with a frightened look informed the general that there was a riot; that the people had arre&s;ted the convoys going to the army; and that they were making violent motions again&s;t the deputies. Wimpfen affected to be angry at the precipitation with which he told him this alarming news. It is no|thing, &s;aid he to the officer; go and talk calmly to the people, make them ea&s;y;
<PB N="101" REF="103">
give them a little money, if it be nece&s;|&s;ary. When this man left us, the gene|ral thought he might venture to make the great propo&s;ition. Reflect maturely on all that I have &s;aid, re&s;umed he: in order to execute great projects we mu&s;t employ great means. But &s;tay, I am going to &s;peak plainly: I &s;ee only one po&s;&s;ible mode of providing our&s;elves with men, arms, ammunition, money, and help of every kind; <HI>that is, to negotiate with England; and my&s;elf have the means provided, but I mu&s;t have your authority, your engagem nt.</HI></P>
<P>"The reader may be a&s;&s;ured that I have a perfect recollection of the lines I have written in Italics, and I can al&s;o a&s;&s;ure him that I have &s;tated truly the &s;cene of the preceding pa&s;&s;age.

con&s;ultation ro&s;e up. The conference was in&s;tantly interrupted, though the general tried every means of renewing it.</P>
<P>"Wimpfen, &s;omewhat di&s;concerted, left us without &s;eeming to feel any re&s;ent|ment. He only repeated to us that he was going to Li&s;ieux, and infinuated, that in order to re&s;train &s;ome malevolent people who were endeavouring in Caen to render us unpopular, we &s;hould all do better to remain in that place. I think that every per&s;on mu&s;t perceive the infa|mous &s;nare into which this worthy ally of the mountain wi&s;hed to draw us. Had fear or the de&s;ire of vengeance prompted us to accede to this propo&s;i|tion, the republic would have been lo&s;t as well as our honour. The mountain would have had victorious proofs again&s;t us. It would have been they who were republicans, we that were royali&s;ts; and all the republicans per&s;ecuted for being royali&s;ts, would have been arre&s;ted,
<PB N="103" REF="105">
impri&s;oned and guillotined. Our con|&s;piracy, they would have &s;aid, extended to the &s;outh. It would have been we, and not them&s;elves, who delivered Tou|lon to the Engli&s;h. I know, indeed, that after their terrible triumphs they did not fail to make &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions; but they found no hone&s;t or enlightened man who gave them credit. They were, therefore, driven to their accu&s;ation of federali&s;m; an accu&s;ation not le&s;s ab&s;urd and calumnious.</P>
<P>"The next day Barbaroux and my&s;elf went to Li&s;ieux. The general was &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us, but he did not receive us with le&s;s courte&s;y. We learn|ed, what he him&s;elf took care not to in|form us, that he had ju&s;t had a &s;ecret conference with one of the agents of the chiefs of the mountain, who for three weeks pa&s;t were throwing away hand|fuls of a&s;&s;ignats at Evreux, and every where on their pa&s;&s;age; and who, &s;oon
<PB N="104" REF="106">
after, probably &s;ure of powerful &s;up|port, came with the intention of con|tinuing the &s;ame plan of corruption at Caen, even under our eyes. We found at Li&s;ieux many people in arms, but no &s;oldiers, no organization, no di&s;cipline, and the rage of making motions. A &s;ecret hand in a &s;ingle day di&s;organized even the <HI>Breton</HI> battalions which had hitherto been firmly united. The gene|ral was at pains to make us ob&s;erve this di&s;order, and to lead us to conclude from thence that he could not maintain his po&s;ition there, but that he mu&s;t march back with all his troops to Caen, and make this city the central point of re&s;i&s;t|ance. &amp;c. He neverthele&s;s avoided repeat|ing to us his Engli&s;h propo&s;itions. Ac|cordingly the retreat took place the fol|lowing day: all my friends then acknow|ledged that our affairs were ruined in the we&s;tern departments. In vain did the general, after having gone back to Caen,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
where he was always de&s;irous of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing him&s;elf, &s;hew di&s;po&s;itions for a &s;erious defence. In vain did he create &s;taff officers, arrange his troops, em|ploy him&s;elf in &s;earching for a conve|nient &s;ituation for encampment, e&s;tabli&s;h batteries of eighteen-pounders: all this parade no longer impo&s;ed on our col|leagues.</P>
<P>"It appears clear that Wimpfen, the evening before, had given notice by one of the couriers of the committee of pub|lic &s;afety, to the mountain; and I hope that I am under&s;tood, when I &s;ay the mountain, that it is not of the whole body, nor even all its leaders, that I &s;peak, but the principal <HI>cordeliers</HI> of the mountain, &s;uch as La Croix, Fabre d'Eglantine, and, who were equally deceiving and &s;hifting between the republicans, Pethi|on, Guadet, &amp;c. and the dictator Ro|be&s;pierre&mdash;that Wimpfen had given in|formation of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his En|gli&s;h
<PB N="106" REF="108">
overtures, and that it was u&s;ele&s;s to renew the propo&s;ition. It al&s;o ap|pears that the mountain then determined to di&s;per&s;e our little band, but without neglecting to throw on our party that colouring of royali&s;m which was &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to effect our ruin; and it was without doubt at this period only that they determined to deliver, at lea&s;t to all appearance, Toulon to the Engli&s;h. What I am now &s;aying will po&s;&s;ibly a&s;|toni&s;h every one who is not well informed as to this bu&s;ine&s;s; but when the proper time &s;hall come, I will explain my&s;elf fully with re&s;pect to this terrible farce of Toulon.</P>
<P>"It is thought that Wimpfen had a &s;afe-conduct from the mountain, and a ready opportunity of going into England; but I know not what became of Mr. Puy&s;ay, who &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;o com|plai&s;antly beaten at Vernon. The admi|ni&s;trators of Calvados had given notice
<PB N="107" REF="109">
to the admini&s;tration of their &s;hameful defection. They had &s;ecretly made their peace with the mountain, without giving us any information. The third day only they made it known to us; and the method they took was to &s;end and po&s;t up at the gate of the <HI>intendance,</HI> where we lodged, the mountain placard, in which was the decree of our being out of the law."</P>
<P>The counterpart of the &s;cene acted at Paris, between the con&s;pirators and the convention, was attempted at Lyons, and the &s;ame day was appointed in both cities for the accompli&s;hment of their purpo&s;e. At the head of this provincial con&s;pi|racy was a man named Chalier, a Pied|montais by birth (for mo&s;t of the agents of the con&s;pirators were foreigners) and a &s;harper by profe&s;&s;ion, having fled his own country on account of having com|mitted fraudulent bankruptcies. He was &s;ent to Lyons by the commune of Paris, after the ma&s;&s;acre of September, and opened his mi&s;&s;ion by the murder of
<PB N="108" REF="110">
nine per&s;ons who had been committed to pri&s;on by the municipality of Lyons for &s;light offences. Agreeably to the in|&s;tructions he had received, and in con|formity to the general plan which the commune of Paris and the con&s;pirators had formed, their apo&s;tle laboured in|ce&s;&s;antly to propagate the doctrines of robbery, rebellion and murder. Seeing that the&s;e exhortations had been attend|ed with their due effects in Paris, "the needy villain's general home," where the promi&s;e of riches without labour had al|lured all the idle and profligate to the &s;tandard of the con&s;pirators, he was di&s;|appointed that more pro&s;elytes to this &s;educing &s;y&s;tem had not honoured his emba&s;&s;y at Lyons, where &s;ociety was le&s;s di&s;united, and where indu&s;try had e&s;|tabli&s;hed a &s;uper&s;titious regard to proper|ty, altogether incompatible with Chalier's &s;y&s;tem of reform. A few, however, he found who li&s;tened to his projects, and to tho&s;e he communicated his plan of regenera|tion,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
which con&s;i&s;ted in placing a guil|lotine the following day on one of the bridges, where all the capital merchants, who were nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;tocrats, were to be executed, and their bodies thrown in|to the Rhone. Though this &s;ecret was imparted under the &s;olemnity of an oath, yet there were &s;ome who touched with remor&s;e gave private notice of it to the citizens, who took mea&s;ures to prevent its execution.</P>
<P>Chalier, who ought in&s;tantly to have been put to death by the ju&s;t indignation of the people, was &s;uffered to continue his revolutionary projects, to the great an|noyance of the wealthy citizens, again&s;t whom his attacks were continually di|rected. By per&s;everance he had at length formed a &s;et out of the profligate which are to be found in all large communities, and with their aid he was encouraged to attempt once more the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
He had been appointed procureur of the commune; and as the municipality were compo&s;ed of Jacobins, and of others as weak as tho&s;e were wicked, Chalier, &s;upported by the faction of Paris, be|came its principal director. Knowing the progre&s;s of the con&s;piracy in that city, he prepared his friends for the &s;ame events at Lyons, by declaring openly in the popular &s;ociety on the 27th of May, that the pre&s;idents and &s;ecretaries of the &s;ections, together with the rich <HI>egoti&s;ts,</HI> &s;hould be beheaded on the following day. The municipality on the 26th, in|fluenced by Chalier, had levied a revo|lutionary tax of &s;ix millions of livres on the rich, to be paid in twenty-four hours. This municipal levy excited murmurs, as was expected, and gave the anarchi&s;ts pretences for rai&s;ing tumults. The rich were de&s;tined to be the victims, and Chalier's band prepared them&s;elves to be the executioners. But the Lyonnais
<PB N="111" REF="113">
might have cru&s;hed this in&s;urrection in its birth, had not the narrow &s;pirit of traffic, which &s;ees nothing beneficial in &s;ociety except the accumulation of wealth, made them feel that their country was but a &s;econdary object, and fitted only to employ the attention of tho&s;e who&s;e time was of le&s;s mercantile profit than their own.</P>
<P>Appri&s;ed of the intentions of the con|&s;pirators, who had made out the li&s;t of the pro&s;criptions, and arranged the plan of the ma&s;&s;acre, the citizens flew to arms, and &s;eized on the ar&s;enal. The con&s;pi|rators kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town-hall, and both parties prepared for action; for Lyons now con&s;i&s;ted only of tho&s;e who intended to murder, and tho&s;e who did not like to be murdered. The com|bat was vigorou&s;ly &s;upported on both &s;ides; for the con&s;pirators were aided by a party of military whom they had pre|viou&s;ly engaged in their intere&s;ts. Vic|tory
<PB N="112" REF="114">
remained doubtful for a long time, as the battle was fought in the &s;treets of the city, one quarter being in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the con&s;pirators, while the re|publicans were ma&s;ters of the other. It was not till midnight that the citizens took the town-hall, which was the head quarters of Chalier's party. This event decided the conte&s;t, which had been &s;e|vere and bloody. The con&s;pirators were impri&s;oned, and their chief, after a long and formal trial, was condemned by the tribunal to death. Had the &s;ame re&s;i&s;t|ance been made to oppre&s;&s;ion in other communes, that of Paris would have been compelled to &s;ubmit to the general will; but as the departments had declined the conte&s;t, Lyons was left to with&s;tand alone all the re&s;entment of the con&s;pi|rators, and was be&s;ieged a few weeks after this period.</P>

<P>THE chief point of accu&s;ation again&s;t the deputies who were arre&s;ted on the &s;econd of June, was the continued op|po&s;ition which they were accu&s;ed of hav|ing made to the formation of a republi|can con&s;titution. This calumny was con|tradicted by the fact; the pro&s;cribed de|puties having, after the labour of &s;ome months, pre&s;ented a plan of con&s;titution to the convention, which had been pub|li&s;hed by its order; but of which it was a part of the con&s;pirators' plan to in|terrupt and prevent the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As many believed that a con&s;titution was the remedy for every evil, moral and political, and even phy&s;ical, that af|flicted the &s;tate; and that, when once prepared and admini&s;tered, all its mala|dies
<PB N="114" REF="116">
would be cured; &s;ome of the de|partments were appea&s;ed by the a&s;&s;urance that their pre&s;ent rulers would give them in a fortnight what they were made to believe their predece&s;&s;ors had &s;o long withheld.</P>
<P>The appearance of this con&s;titution within the appointed time tended greatly to allay the di&s;contents, and gave an air of popularity to the proceedings of the con&s;pirators; for, as long as the people obtained the ble&s;&s;ing, they were indiffer|ent from what hand they received it. They were little aware of the purpo&s;es of their tyrants, who only giving them one &s;hort glimp&s;e of this wi&s;hed-for con|&s;titution, and having obtained their &s;anc|tion of it, threw it a&s;ide, locked up this hallowed book of the law, &s;hrowded with a dark veil the tables of the rights of man, and boldly proclaimed a new-in|vented &s;pecies of tyranny, under the de|nomination of revolutionary government.
<PB N="115" REF="117">
That epithet has &s;ince ju&s;tified every enormity, warranted the violation of every principle: and theft and pillage, noyades and fu&s;ilades have all received the common appellation of revolutionary mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>What contributed al&s;o to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;torm that was going to be poured on Paris, was the dread which the depart|ments them&s;elves had of extending the civil war, which then raged in the coun|try &s;outh of the Loire, when there was a po&s;&s;ibility of attaining by milder means the objects they had in view, the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of their repre&s;entatives, and confining the extravagant power of the commune of Paris within its ju&s;t bounds. What al&s;o mi&s;led them was, the &s;ubjec|tion to which Paris it&s;elf was reduced, and which, deceived by addre&s;&s;es from the convention and the commune, they mi&s;took for the enjoyment of tranquillity; and what fini&s;hed the conte&s;t was the thunder of the con&s;pirators hurled again&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="118">
the departments which had &s;hewn mo&s;t zeal in favour of the impri&s;oned deputies, the con&s;tituted powers of which were di&s;&s;olved by the convention, and its members declared guilty of acts of re|bellion. It was fortunate for the u&s;urpers, that this almo&s;t general and &s;peedy ac|quie&s;cence took place; as, independently of the coale&s;ced powers, they had a mo&s;t formidable enemy to contend with in the royali&s;ts of the Vend&eacute;e, who, while the&s;e &s;truggles for power convul&s;ed Paris, were organizing a force that, but for the invin|cible &s;pirit of liberty that in&s;pired the im|men&s;e majority of the republic, was cal|culated to overwhelm every contending party, and bring back the antient de&s;poti&s;m with all the avenging terrors of &s;acerdotal and ari&s;tocratical rage.</P>
<P>The country which was the &s;cene of this in&s;urrection in favour of prie&s;thood and royal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y, is &s;ituated between the Loire and the Charente, &s;tretching along the
<PB N="117" REF="119">
coa&s;ts between the two rivers, and mak|ing part of the territory which was call|ed, under the ancient government, the province of Poitou. It is a country fer|tile both in corn and pa&s;ture; and from its rich abundance di&s;tributed plenty to mo&s;t of the neighbouring departments, and furni&s;hed even to the centre of France a con&s;iderable part of its &s;upplies. Where nature had done &s;o much to make this region the &s;eat of plenty, the inhabi|tant was not &s;olicitous to increa&s;e his riches by foreign traffic; &s;o that com|merce contributed but little to his opu|lence, and manufacturers were almo&s;t un|known. However innocent and pa&s;toral the life of the &s;hepherd and the hu&s;band|man has been repre&s;ented, and however productive of tho&s;e vices that corrupt and enervate mankind the commercial intercour&s;e between nations may have been found; this communication brings with it an interchange of knowledge and
<PB N="118" REF="120">
manners which improves and embelli&s;hes &s;ociety, while the permanent habitudes of the former &s;erve to retain him in a &s;tate which adds nothing to the common &s;tock of knowledge, and contributes no|thing to the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the world. The negative merit of ex|emption from vices to which we have never been tempted, may be granted to this intellectual darkne&s;s, where it is placed beyond the reach of endangering more enlightened &s;ociety; but when ig|norance becomes the &s;port of fanatici&s;m, and ambitious men make it the in&s;tru|ment of their guilty de&s;igns, it becomes a calamity the mo&s;t terrible in the li&s;t of human evils.</P>
<P>The department of the Vend&eacute;e, from its local &s;ituation, had little other inter|cour&s;e with the re&s;t of the republic than what aro&s;e from the export of the &s;uper|fluity of its produce; and while the great and immortal principles which directed
<PB N="119" REF="121">
the revolution awakened in the bo&s;om of every mechanic and pea&s;ant through|out France the noble &s;entiment that no man was &s;uperior to him in his rights, the Vend&eacute;an, who had only heard of the&s;e things through the organ of the noble and the prie&s;t, remained the implicit be|liever and obedient va&s;&s;al, while his fel|low-citizens were rejoicing in their eman|cipation.</P>
<P>In this in&s;ulated department the feodal &s;y&s;tem had been maintained in all its rigour. The provincial laws of Brittany, which, from the minutene&s;s and &s;ingu|larity of their oppre&s;&s;ion, would be rather &s;ubjects of ridicule than abhorrence, had they not contributed &s;o much to the de|gradation of the human character in the tyrant who inflicted and the &s;lave who &s;uffered them, were incorporated with other laws equally barbarous, and peculiar to the country.</P>
<P>As this part of the republic, from its
<PB N="120" REF="122">
geographical and moral &s;ituation, had received but a few faint rays of the light of that liberty which had bur&s;t forth in France; and as already the &s;eeds of di&s;|cord had been plentifully &s;cattered among the inhabitants by the fanatical clergy, it was fitted to become the retreat of all who were aver&s;e to the new order of pub|lic affairs. Accordingly the nobles and the prie&s;ts, who, in the fir&s;t meetings of the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, di&s;covered, that by the removal of tho&s;e factitious bar|riers by which they had hitherto been &s;eparated from the other cla&s;&s;es of the people, they were now to mingle in the common ma&s;s, found refuge in the&s;e de|partments, where they tru&s;ted that tho&s;e di&s;tinctions might &s;till be re&s;pected which had el&s;ewhere &s;unk into contempt. Their influence was exten&s;ive; and as their zeal was quickened by implacable re&s;entment, tho&s;e laws of which they could not hin|der the promulgation, and particularly
<PB N="121" REF="123">
tho&s;e which re&s;pected their own orders, were but imperfectly executed, or appa|rently obeyed. Having found that that enthu&s;ia&s;m which led the con&s;tituent a&s;|&s;embly to overthrow the&s;e gigantic pri|vileges, had con&s;iderably evaporated to|wards its clo&s;e; and &s;eeing al&s;o that the court, in &s;truggling to regain its lo&s;t power, &s;ought their alliance; they grew bolder in their preten&s;ions, and became more active in their hatred towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new government. At fir&s;t an air of general di&s;content over|&s;pread this part of the country&mdash;partial fermentations next &s;ucceeded, and the &s;pi|rit of in&s;urrection at length became &s;o general, that the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly was compelled to take mea&s;ures to &s;top its alarming progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The means employed by the legi&s;lature were calculated rather to increa&s;e than prevent the evil; for, in&s;tead of &s;ending commi&s;&s;aries from their own body to
<PB N="122" REF="124">
examine into its cau&s;es; in&s;tead of en|lightening the people, and unma&s;king and puni&s;hing tho&s;e who had prompted them to rebellion; they entru&s;ted the court with the execution of their decrees, and, as it might have been expected, the in|&s;urrection obtained additional force, and even a &s;ort of royal &s;anction.</P>
<P>The authority of the next a&s;&s;embly was in&s;ufficient to repre&s;s &s;o alarming an evil. Too much divided by the &s;pirit of party, and too much occupied in &s;truggles again&s;t the court, the legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;embly for a long time applied only palliatives to the di&s;ea&s;e; nor, till it wore an a&s;pect dangerous to the exi&s;t|ence of the revolution, was the a&s;&s;embly rou&s;ed to the application of any effective remedy. The mea&s;ure they fir&s;t propo&s;ed was the bani&s;hment of the prie&s;ts who had refu&s;ed adherence to the new con&s;ti|tution; but this mea&s;ure appeared &s;o alarming to the court, and &s;o de&s;tructive
<PB N="123" REF="125">
of the &s;y&s;tem it had adopted to regain its lo&s;t influence, that the king was advi&s;ed to make u&s;e of the repre&s;&s;ive power which the con&s;titution gave him, and to refu&s;e his royal &s;anction. Though this refu&s;al ha&s;tened the de&s;truction of the court, already tottering, it gave new courage to the di&s;contented, who, find|ing them&s;elves &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;upported, bur&s;t into open re&s;i&s;tance in the Vend&eacute;e and the neighbouring departments, which it required all the exertion of the depart|mental force to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fall of the court &s;u&s;pended for a time the progre&s;s of this in&s;urrection; but the unhappy au&s;pices under which the convention met in&s;pired fre&s;h ardour, and led the in&s;urgents to new exertions. In hopes of re&s;toring the monarchy, a va&s;t plan of in&s;urrection was formed, which not only comprehended the Ven|d&eacute;e and the adjoining departments, but extended it&s;elf through a great part of
<PB N="124" REF="126">
Brittany. The convention was too much occupied in re&s;i&s;ting the con&s;pirators at Paris to attend to the progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts, who were &s;uffered to take un|interrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Vend&eacute;e and the neighbouring departments. Before the end of March they had organized an army of 40,000 men, con&s;i&s;ting chief|ly of pea&s;ants, &s;ervants of the former no|bility, &s;mugglers, poachers and game-keepers, men well accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of arms, and had begun their march towards Paris before the convention were formally advi&s;ed that any in&s;urrection had taken place. Their army was com|manded by experienced chiefs who had &s;erved under the antient government: but what gave the rebellion its fierce&s;t rage was the fanatici&s;m which the prie&s;t in&s;pired, who marching at the head of their columns, bearing the crucifix in his hand, pointed out to his followers the road to victory or heaven. The pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="127">
which the royali&s;ts had made be|fore any force was oppo&s;ed to them was &s;o alarming, and at the period when the Jacobins had &s;eized upon the govern|ment at Paris, the portion of the coun|try which the Vend&eacute;ens had &s;ubdued was &s;o exten&s;ive, that it &s;eemed doubt|ful of which party France was de&s;tined to be the prey. The royali&s;ts had en|tire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Loire almo&s;t as far as Paris, and menaced Rochelle on the one &s;ide while they be&s;ieged Nantes on the other, and opened a pa&s;&s;age into the departments which made part of the for|mer province of Brittany.</P>
<P>The faction at Paris did not fail to improve the events of the Vend&eacute;e to their own advantage. Pethion, Buzot, Rabaud St. Etienne, I&s;nard, Lanjui|nais, Barbaroux, Guadet, Louvet and others of the pro&s;cribed deputies having made their e&s;cape, the con&s;pirators de|clared, in an addre&s;s to the departments,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
that the project of the deputies who were &s;till in arre&s;tation was evidently the &s;ame as that of their colleagues, who were gone to facilitate the march of the rebels, and aid them in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the royal power. This calumny, which was re|futed by every addre&s;s received from the departments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. II.</NOTE>, formed the ba&s;is of the accu&s;ation which was framed again&s;t the Gironde; and the founders and mo&s;t &s;trenuous &s;upporters of the republic were &s;oon after dragged to the &s;caffold as the advocates and protectors of royalty.</P>
<P>In proportion as the departments re|laxed in their energy, the ferocity of the con&s;pirators increa&s;ed. An event al&s;o happened at this period, which, from the calumnies to which it gave ri&s;e, and the con&s;equences it produced, proved fatal to the arre&s;ted deputies. This was the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination of Marat. In the fir&s;t dawn

of the con&s;piracy Marat became a prin|cipal in&s;trument in the hands of the trai|tors, who found him well fitted for their purpo&s;es; and being &s;aved from the pu|ni&s;hment which u&s;ually follows per&s;onal in&s;ult by the contempt which the defor|mity and diminutivene&s;s of his per&s;on ex|cited, he became the habitual retailer of all the fal&s;ehoods and calumnies which were invented by his party again&s;t every man of influence or reputation. He was the Ther&s;ites of the convention, whom no one would deign to cha&s;ti&s;e; for his extravagance made his employers often di&s;claim him as a fool, while the general &s;entiment he excited was the &s;ort of an|tipathy we feel for a loath&s;ome reptile. His political &s;entiments often varied; for he &s;ometimes exhorted the choice of a chief, and &s;ometimes made declamations in favour of a limited monarchy; but what rendered him u&s;eful to the con&s;pi|rators was his readine&s;s to publi&s;h every
<PB N="128" REF="130">
&s;lander which they framed, and to ex|hort to every horror which they medi|tated.&mdash;His rage for denunciation was &s;o great that he became the dupe of the idle; and his daily paper contains the names of great criminals who exi&s;ted only in the imagination of tho&s;e who im|po&s;ed on his credulous malignity.</P>
<P>After this fir&s;t preacher of blood had performed the part allotted to him in the plan of evil, he was confined to his cham|ber by a lingering di&s;ea&s;e to which he was &s;ubject, and of which he would proba|bly &s;oon have died. But he was a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated in his bath by a young woman who had travelled with this intention from Caen in Normandy. Charlotte Anne Marie Corday was a native of St. Saturnin in the department of the Orne. She appears to have lived in a &s;tate of literary retirement with her father, and by the &s;tudy of antient and modern hi&s;|torians to have imbibed a &s;trong attach|ment
<PB N="129" REF="131">
to liberty. She had been accu&s;|tomed to a&s;&s;imilate certain periods of antient hi&s;tory with the events that were pa&s;&s;ing before her, and was probably excited by the examples of antiquity to the commi&s;&s;ion of a deed, which &s;he be|lieved with fond enthu&s;ia&s;m would de|liver and &s;ave her country.</P>
<P>Being at Caen when the citizens of the department were enrolling them&s;elves to march to the relief of the convention, the animation with which &s;he &s;aw them devoting their lives to their country, led her to execute, without delay, the pro|ject &s;he had formed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Louvet &s;peaks of this extraordinary woman in the following terms:&mdash;"A young per&s;on came to &s;peak to Barbaroux at the Intendance where we all lodged. She was tall and well &s;haped, of the mo&s;t graceful manners and mode&s;t demeanour: there was in her countenance, which was beautiful and engag|ing, and in all her movements, a mixture of &s;oftne&s;s and dignity, which were evident indications of a heavenly mind. She came always attended by a &s;ervant, and waited for Barbaroux in an apartment through which we pa&s;&s;ed frequently. Since this young woman has fixed on her&s;elf the attention of the world, we have each of us recollected the cir|cum&s;tances of her vi&s;its, of which it is now clear that &s;ome favour &s;olicited for a friend was only a pretence. Her true motive undoubtedly was to be|come acquainted with &s;ome of the founders of the republic, for which &s;he was going to devote her&s;elf; and perhaps &s;he was de&s;irous that at &s;ome future day her features &s;hould be brought to their recol|lection.</P>
<P>"I declare and &s;olemnly atte&s;t, that &s;he never communicated to us a word of her de&s;ign; and if &s;uch actions could be directed, and &s;he had con&s;ult|ed us, would it have been again&s;t Marat that we &s;hould have pointed her &s;troke? Did we not know that he was then langui&s;hing under a fatal di&s;ea&s;e, and had but a few days to live?"</P></NOTE>. Under pretence
<PB N="130" REF="132">
of going home, &s;he came to Paris, and the third day after her arrival obtained admi&s;&s;ion to Marat. She had invented a &s;tory to deceive him; and when he promi&s;ed her that all the promoters of
<PB N="131" REF="133">
the in&s;urrection in the departments &s;hould be &s;ent to the guillotine, &s;he drew out a knife which &s;he had purcha&s;ed for the occa&s;ion, and plunged it into his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>She was immediately apprehended, and conducted to the Abbaye pri&s;on, from which &s;he was transferred to the Concier|gerie, and brought before the revolution|ary tribunal.</P>
<P>She acknowledged the deed, and ju&s;|tified it by a&s;&s;erting that it was a duty &s;he owed her country and mankind to rid the world of a mon&s;ter who&s;e &s;anguinary doctrines were framed to in|volve the country in anarchy and civil war, and a&s;&s;erted her right to put Ma|rat to death as a convict already con|demned by the public opinion. She tru&s;ted that her example would in&s;pire the people with that energy which had been at all times the di&s;tingui&s;hed cha|racteri&s;tic of republicans; and which &s;he defined to be that devotedne&s;s to our
<PB N="132" REF="134">
country which renders life of little com|parative e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Her deportment during the trial was mode&s;t and dignified. There was &s;o engaging a &s;oftne&s;s in her countenance, that it was difficult to conceive how &s;he could have armed her&s;elf with &s;ufficient intrepidity to execute the deed. Her an|&s;wers to the interrogatories of the court were full of point and energy. She &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed the audience by her wit, and excited their admiration by her eloquence. Her face &s;ometimes beamed with &s;ublimity, and was &s;ometimes co|vered with &s;miles. At the clo&s;e of her trial &s;he took three letters from her bo|&s;om, and pre&s;ented them to the judges, and reque&s;ted they might be forwarded to the per&s;ons to whom they were ad|dre&s;&s;ed. Two were written to Barba|roux, in which with great ea&s;e and &s;pi|rit &s;he relates her adventures from her leaving Caen to the morning of her trial.
<PB N="133" REF="135">
The other was an affectionate and &s;o|lemn adieu to her father. She retired while the jury deliberated on their ver|dict; and when &s;he again entered the tri|bunal there was a maje&s;tic &s;olemnity in her demeanour which perfectly became her &s;ituation. She heard her &s;entence with attention and compo&s;ure; and after conver&s;ing for a few minutes with her coun&s;el and a friend of mine who had &s;at near her during the trial, and whom &s;he reque&s;ted to di&s;charge &s;ome trifling debts &s;he had incurred in the pri&s;on, &s;he left the court with the &s;ame &s;erenity, and prepared her&s;elf for the la&s;t &s;cene.</P>
<P>She had concluded her letter to her father with this ver&s;e of Corneille,
<Q><L>C'e&s;t le crime qui fait la honte, et non pas l'&eacute;|chafaud,</L></Q>
and it is difficult to conceive the kind of heroi&s;m which &s;he di&s;played in the way to execution. The women who were
<PB N="134" REF="136">
called furies of the guillotine, and who had a&s;&s;embled to in&s;ult her on leaving the pri&s;on, were awed into &s;ilence by her demeanour, while &s;ome of the &s;pectators uncovered their heads before her, and others gave loud tokens of applau&s;e. There was &s;uch an air of cha&s;tened exul|tation thrown over her countenance, that &s;he in&s;pired &s;entiments of love rather than &s;en&s;ations of pity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She excited in this intere&s;ting &s;ituation a very &s;trong and &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ion in a young man of the name of Adam Lux, a commi&s;&s;ary from Mayence. He accidentally cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing in her way to execution, and became in&s;tantly ena|moured not of her only, but, what was more extra|ordinary, of the guillotine. He publi&s;hed a few days after a pamphlet, in which he propo&s;ed rai&s;ing a &s;tatue to her honour, and in&s;cribing on the pede&s;tal "<HI>Greater than Bruius,</HI>" and invoked her &s;hade wandering through Ely&s;ium with tho&s;e glorious per&s;onages who had devoted them&s;elves for their country. He was &s;ent to the pri&s;on of the Force, where a friend of mine often &s;aw him, and where he talked of nothing to him but of Charlotte Cor|day and the guillotine; which, &s;ince &s;he had peri&s;h|ed, appeared to him transformed into an altar, on which he would con&s;ider it as a privilege to be &s;acri|ficed, and was only &s;olicitous to receive the &s;troke of death from the identical in&s;trument by which &s;he had &s;uffered. A few weeks after his impri&s;onment he was executed as a counter-revolutioni&s;t.</NOTE>. She a&s;cended
<PB N="135" REF="137">
the &s;caffold with undaunted firmne&s;s, and, knowing that &s;he had only to die, was re&s;olved to die with dignity. She had learned from her jailor the mode of puni&s;hment, but was not in&s;tructed in the detail; and when the executioner at|tempted to tie her feet to the plank, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, from an apprehen&s;ion that he had been ordered to in&s;ult her; but on his explaining him&s;elf &s;he &s;ubmitted with a &s;mile. When he took off her handker|chief, the moment before &s;he bent under the fatal &s;troke, &s;he blu&s;hed deeply; and her head, which was held up to the mul|titude the moment after, exhibited this la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of offended mode&s;ty.</P>

The leaders of the faction, who thought every mea&s;ure good that could be made &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;e, found this event too replete with favourable cir|cum&s;tances to be neglected. Marat, whom they had thrown a&s;ide to die at lei&s;ure, unle&s;s perchance he &s;hould have lived to &s;hare the fate to which they afterwards condemned their other agents, was now re&s;tored to more than his an|tient honours, was proclaimed a martyr, and his death ordered to be lamented as an irreparable lo&s;s to the republic. The con&s;pirators declared that no farther doubt of the federali&s;m of the depart|ments remained. The death of Marat was the point of conviction. Every member of the mountain was to be a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inated in his turn, and the traitors of the departments had their accomplices in Paris who had whetted their poniards to involve the city in de&s;truction. Though the Pari&s;ians were not &s;ufficiently credu|lous
<PB N="137" REF="139">
to believe the&s;e calumnies, the fac|tion made them the pretence to proceed to the farther commi&s;&s;ion of crimes; and while they endeavoured to amu&s;e the people with what they called the inaugu|ration of Marat and of Chalier, they were meditating the murder of the depu|ties whom they had driven from the le|gi&s;lature.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate with|out indignation and de&s;pair that glorious revolution, which had opened to man|kind the brighte&s;t pro&s;pects of happi|ne&s;s, and which had promi&s;ed the mo&s;t beneficial effects to the world, become the &s;port of the cruel, and the prey of the rapacious; to &s;ee a people who were called to liberty, bending their necks, like the votaries of the &s;toried a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the mountain, at the nod of their tyrant; to &s;ee a nation which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Rou&s;|&s;eau, Mably and Voltaire, pro&s;trate in frantic enthu&s;ia&s;m before the &s;hrine of

Marat, like the idolaters of Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tapama, who&s;e devotion ro&s;e in proportion to the hideou&s;ne&s;s of their gods.</P>
<P>Every day &s;ome pretended plot was di&s;covered, &s;ome dark con&s;piracy, at|tributed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to nobles, prie&s;ts, bankers and foreigners, was dragged to light; but the &s;pecimens produced of the&s;e counter-revolutionary projects were often &s;uch as did little honour to the in|vention of tho&s;e by whom they were ex|hibited. Sometimes letters were found from agents of the coale&s;ced powers; but they were generally &s;o ill fabricated that they only deceived tho&s;e who could not read them.</P>
<P>The departments having &s;ubmitted to the u&s;urpers, they now began their mea|&s;ures of &s;everity again&s;t tho&s;e who had re&s;i&s;ted their authority. The general denomination for di&s;affection to their principles was that of being &s;u&s;pected; and accordingly a decree was i&s;&s;ued to
<PB N="139" REF="141">
arre&s;t all tho&s;e who came under this title. The revolutionary tribunal not having all the energy nece&s;&s;ary to carry into execution the plans that were medi|tating, was denounced for its <HI>moderanti&s;m,</HI> and the members of which it was com|po&s;ed, renewed.</P>
<P>A certain cla&s;s of the women of Paris, whogave them&s;elves the title of revolution|ary women, had been &s;erviceable auxilia|ries to the con&s;pirators, and had taken place of the poi&s;&s;ards, who not having all the energy which the pre&s;ent exigencies required, had yielded the palm to their revolutionary &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The&s;e female politicians held deliberative a&s;&s;emblies, and afterwards pre&s;ented their views to the convention, while they influenced its debates by their vociferations in the tribunes, which they now exclu&s;ively oc|cupied. On the days of tumult which preceded the 31&s;t of May they had mounted guard in per&s;on at the con|vention,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
and prevented the execution of certain orders which they di&s;liked. They now pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the bar of the a&s;&s;embly, and demanded the exclu|&s;ion of the former nobles from every function civil or military, the renewal of all the admini&s;trations throughout the republic, the examination of the con|duct of the mini&s;ters, the arre&s;t of every &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, the rai&s;ing of the whole nation in ma&s;s, and obliging the women to wear red caps. The convention hav|ing &s;hewn &s;ome di&s;inclination to comply with the&s;e mode&s;t requi&s;itions, the&s;e fe|male politicians in&s;ulted &s;ome of the members, and the &s;ociety was di&s;&s;olved by a decree.</P>
<P>In the mean time the royali&s;ts had pro|ceeded almo&s;t as far as Tours on their way to Paris. Lyons was in a &s;tate of formidable re&s;i&s;tance. The Mar&s;eillois were at Avignon. Mentz &s;urrendered to the Pru&s;&s;ians. The province of Al&s;ace
<PB N="141" REF="143">
was over-run by the Au&s;trians. Valen|ciennes was taken after a formidable &s;iege, and Cambray was &s;ummoned to &s;urrender. The Piedmonte&s;e had invaded the department of Montblanc, formerly Savoy, the Spaniards had inve&s;ted Per|pignan, and the Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters of Toulon.</P>
<P>More efficient mea&s;ures became nece&s;|&s;ary than had hitherto been employed, and that which was now adopted was put|ting into requi&s;ition every individual that could be made u&s;eful to his country in any &s;ituation in which his &s;ervices were claimed. That part of the community which was de&s;tined to the mo&s;t active &s;ervice were the young men from 18 to 25 years of age, who under the name of the fir&s;t requi&s;ition were immediately in|ve&s;ted with the title of the defenders of their country, and, as &s;oon as arms were procured, &s;ent to the frontiers.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">
Whatever may be the difference of po|litical opinion re&s;pecting the events of the French revolution, there can be no di&s;|&s;enting voice again&s;t the tribute of ho|nour and applau&s;e which belongs to the armies of the republic. Amid&s;t all the internal commotions of contending chiefs, regardle&s;s of plain or mountain, of <HI>c&ocirc;t&eacute; droit</HI> or <HI>c&ocirc;t&eacute; gauche,</HI> they &s;aw their coun|try invaded, and bravely repul&s;ed the at|tack, leaving the arrangement of the in|ternal concerns of the &s;tate to the indivi|duals who were left behind. They were not of that cla&s;s which compo&s;es the u&s;ual ma&s;s of armies, the idle and the profligate who &s;eek a refuge from indu&s;try or want in the vocation of a &s;oldier; and they were of that age when the love of mili|tary glory and the pa&s;&s;ion for liberty are felt with the greate&s;t ardour. This pa&s;&s;ion was nouri&s;hed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that their &s;ections, their communes, the con|vention,
<PB N="143" REF="145">
and their country were looking on them with fond and anxious expecta|tion, and the decrees which declared that they de&s;erved well of the republic ani|mated them with a more ardent de&s;ire to merit the eulogium.</P>
<P>One of the great &s;prings which me|chanically in&s;pired courage and re&s;o|lution, was the patriotic &s;ongs and hymns which were continually re&s;ound|ing through their camps. But the great moral motive that urged them to valor|ous deeds, was that contempt of death which men in all ages, who combat for liberty and their country, have felt, and this was a motive which their antagoni&s;ts could not feel. The &s;oldier was con&s;ci|ous that, if he &s;urvived, he &s;hould partake of the honour he had laboured to acquire; and if he died, that his country would enroll his name among&s;t tho&s;e of its de|liverers, and that his fate would in&s;pire that &s;entiment which our animated poet
<PB N="144" REF="146">
has &s;o beautifully de&s;cribed in his ode on the glorious dead.<Q><L>How &s;leep the brave, who &s;ink to re&s;t</L>

<L>There Honour comes a pilgrim grey</L>
<L>To ble&s;s the turf that wraps their clay,</L>
<L>And Freedom &s;hall a while repair</L>
<L>To dwell a weeping hermit there.</L></Q></P>
<P>"But the life of a modern &s;oldier," Dr. John&s;on has ob&s;erved, "is ill repre|&s;ented by heroic fiction. War has means of de&s;truction more formidable than the cannon and the &s;word. Of the thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands that peri&s;hed in our late conte&s;t with France and Spain, a very &s;mall part ever felt the &s;troke of an ene|my. The re&s;t langui&s;hed in tents and &s;hips, amid&s;t damps and putrefaction,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
pale, torpid, &s;piritle&s;s and helple&s;s, ga&s;p|ing and groaning, unpitied among men made obdurate by long continuance of helple&s;s mi&s;ery, and were at la&s;t whelm|ed in pits or heaved into the ocean with|out notice and without remembrance. By incommodious encampments and un|whole&s;ome &s;tations, where courage is u&s;e|le&s;s and enterpri&s;e impracticable, fleets are &s;ilently di&s;peopled, and armies &s;luggi&s;hly melted away."</P>
<P>From this deva&s;tation of di&s;ea&s;e the French have been exempted; for the evils which Dr. John&s;on enumerates mo&s;t commonly proceed from the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e conveniences which money can procure. But a great part of the fir&s;t requi&s;ition, which was taken from the cla&s;s of the rich as well as of the poor, were enabled, by the attention of their friends, and the expenditure of their own income, to procure not only the means

<P>THE u&s;urpers &s;aw that tho&s;e young citizens who had obeyed with alacrity the call of the convention again&s;t the com|mon enemy were not fitted to be the in|&s;truments of the&s;e revolutionary projects. Revolutionary committees had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in every commune of the depart|ments, and in every &s;ection of Paris; but though the la&s;t were in general compo&s;ed of the creatures of the faction, they were not &s;o &s;ecure of what they called the <HI>energy</HI> of the committees in the country. For this rea&s;on, a certain number of what was term|ed the mo&s;t &s;an&s;culottide and revolution|ary citizens of each &s;ection of Paris were cho&s;en by their re&s;pective committees to compo&s;e a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, which was called the revolutionary army,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
and which, accompanied by a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A travelling guillotine.</NOTE> guillotine ambulante, was to i&s;&s;ue forth from Paris into the departments, to invite the people to rai&s;e them&s;elves to the height of the revolution.</P>
<P>In the mean while the u&s;urpers framed an act of accu&s;ation again&s;t the deputies whom they had driven from the conven|tion on the 31&s;t of May, and arre&s;ted the &s;eventy-three members who had prote&s;ted again&s;t that mea&s;ure. At this period al&s;o the vague report of a &s;py, that Beauvais a deputy of the convention had been put to death by the Engli&s;h at Toulon, &s;erved as a pretext to the u&s;urpers for in|flicting twenty years impri&s;onment on whoever &s;hould introduce Engli&s;h mer|chandize into the republic, and for throw|ing into pri&s;on and confi&s;cating the pro|perty of all tho&s;e who had been born in the Briti&s;h dominions, except &s;uch as
<PB N="149" REF="151">
were employed in manufactures. This impolitic and &s;avage decree, in open vio|lation of the rights of nations, and breach of that ho&s;pitality under the protection of which but a few months before they had invited the Engli&s;h then in France to re|main among them, was put into execu|tion; and though it met with univer&s;al reprobation, yet as terror was the order of the day, no one felt him&s;elf &s;ufficiently bold to demand its repeal; and as bu&s;ine&s;s of more importance lay before the con|&s;pirators than the con&s;ideration of the ca&s;es of individuals, tho&s;e who had the cre|dulity to tru&s;t to their protection were left to ruminate on their inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep taken by the con&s;pira|tors was that of throwing a&s;ide the incum|brance of the con&s;titution. A report was accordingly prepared, &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of conducting the machine of the revolution without the u&s;e of ex|traordinary mea&s;ures, and the convention
<PB N="150" REF="152">
voted without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that the con&s;ti|tution &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, and that the government &s;hould become revolution|ary. The &s;uperiority of a monarchical over a republican government has been &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the unity of its action, particularly in ca&s;es of danger. The Romans in time of great public calamity were accu&s;tomed to throw a veil over the tables of the laws, and place in the hands of one of their fellow-citizens, whom they called a Dictator, the whole energy of the government, as long as the danger which threatened the &s;tate &s;hould exi&s;t. Rou&s;&s;eau admires this policy, and recom|mends it in &s;imilar ca&s;es to all free go|vernments. Of whatever advantage the temporary ab&s;ence of liberty might have been, had the people of France, like the Romans, cho&s;en tho&s;e to rule the &s;torm who had the greate&s;t &s;kill or the mo&s;t acknowledged virtue; tho&s;e &s;anguinary and ferocious characters who now &s;eized
<PB N="151" REF="153">
on the power, in&s;tead of making this tem|porary de&s;poti&s;m a means of &s;aving the country, like the malevolent genii who pre&s;ide over evil, filled it with horror, de&s;olation, and death.</P>
<P>To reconcile the nation to the a&s;&s;ump|tion of their new power, the con&s;pirators thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew their di&s;tin|gui&s;hing attachment to what they called the people by the exerci&s;e of every kind of per&s;ecution again&s;t what they called ari&s;tocracy, an appellation by no means confined to the adherents of the former court or the nobility. To the "ari&s;to|cracy of talents" &s;ucceeded the "ari&s;|tocracy of commerce," which &s;ignified that he who enriched him&s;elf while he enriched his country by the &s;upply of its wants, was an object of &s;u&s;picion, or a counter-revolutioni&s;t. They therefore conceived the project of reducing every article of merchandize and &s;ubli&s;tence to what they called the <HI>maximum,</HI> and ob|liged
<PB N="152" REF="154">
light every merchant and &s;hop-keeper to &s;ell his goods to the public at the pre|&s;cribed rate, whatever might have been the fir&s;t co&s;t. Though it was evident to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure mu&s;t be eventually de&s;tructive of commerce, and productive of the evil it was intended to prevent; yet, as it was an evil that but remotely affected the con|&s;umer, it was calculated to plea&s;e the lower cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>The faction, armed with the ab&s;olute power they had u&s;urped, fancied they could controll all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances; and though they could not but perceive that the manufacturer mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;e his labour when the new materials exceeded the &s;tated price of the goods he expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and that the merchant could no longer go on with his com|merce, when the cargo which he had pur|cha&s;ed abroad was &s;truck with the revo|lutionary <HI>maximum</HI> on its entrance into
<PB N="153" REF="155">
port; though they could not but &s;ee that it was a law fraught with every evil, yet as it was a blow at the ari&s;tocracy of commerce, and a revolutionary mea&s;ure, it was propo&s;ed and adopted.</P>
<P>While they were thus per&s;uading the people what intere&s;t they took in their welfare by the introduction of plenty, in the extinction of monopolies, and the re|duction of the price of merchandize, they were equally &s;olicitous to &s;hew their re|gard for the public &s;afety by the puni&s;h|ment of traitors and con&s;pirators. For a long time the Jacobins had demanded the trial of Marie Antoinette, who&s;e exi&s;tence they declared endangered that of the re|public. She was accordingly arraigned for having committed a &s;eries of crimes, which in the language of the indictment comprehended not merely counter-revolu|tion ary projects, but all the enormities of the Me&s;&s;alinas, Brunehauts, Fredegondes, and Medicis. A curious account of the
<PB N="154" REF="156">
evidence in &s;upport of the&s;e charges, and the effect which her behaviour produced upon Robe&s;pierre, is given by Vilate, a young man of the revolutionary tribunal. The &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed during the trial, at a tavern near the Tuilleries, where he was invited to dine with Robe&s;pierre, Barrere, and St. Ju&s;t. "Seated around the table," he &s;ays, "in a clo&s;e and retired room, they a&s;ked me to give them &s;ome leading fea|tures of the evidence on the trial of the Au&s;trian. I did not forget that expo&s;tu|lation of in&s;ulted nature when, Hebert accu&s;ing Antoinette of having committed the mo&s;t &s;hocking crime, &s;he turned with dignity towards the audience, and &s;aid, "I appeal to the con&s;cience and feelings of every mother pre&s;ent, to declare if there be one among&s;t them who does not &s;hudder at the idea of &s;uch hor|rors." Robe&s;pierre, &s;truck with this an|&s;wer as by an electrical &s;troke, broke his plate with his fork. "That blockhead
<PB N="155" REF="157">
Hebert!" cried he, "as if it were not enough that &s;he was really a Me&s;&s;alina, he mu&s;t make her an Agrippina al&s;o, and furni&s;h her with the triumph of exciting the &s;ympathy of the public in her la&s;t moments."</P>
<P>Marie Antoinette made no defence, and called no witne&s;&s;es, alleging that no po&s;itive fact had been produced again&s;t her. She had pre&s;erved an uniform be|haviour during the whole of her trial, ex|cept when a &s;tarting tear accompanied her an&s;wer to Hebert. She was con|demned about four in the morning, and heard her &s;entence with compo&s;ure. But her firmne&s;s for&s;ook her in the way from the court to her dungeon&mdash;&s;he bur&s;t into tears; when, as if a&s;hamed of this weakne&s;s, &s;he ob&s;erved to her guards, that though &s;he wept at that moment, they &s;hould &s;ee her go to the &s;caffold without &s;hedding a tear.</P>
<P>In her way to execution, where &s;he
<PB N="156" REF="158">
was taken after the accu&s;tomed manner in a cart, with her hands tied behind her, &s;he paid little attention to the prie&s;t who attended her, and &s;till le&s;s to the &s;ur|rounding multitude. Her eyes, though bent on vacancy, did not conceal the emotion that was labouring at her heart&mdash;her cheeks were &s;ometimes in a &s;ingu|lar manner &s;treaked with red, and &s;ome|times over&s;pread with deadly palene&s;s; but her general look was that of indig|nant &s;orrow. She reached the place of execution about noon; and when &s;he turned her eyes towards the gardens and the palace, &s;he became vi&s;ibly agitated. She a&s;cended the &s;caffold with precipita|tion, and her head was in a moment held up to the people by the executioner.</P>
<P>The trial of Marie Antoinette was followed by that of the accu&s;ed deputies. Although tho&s;e guardians of the public weal, the Jacobins, had repeatedly urged the convention to bring forward their
<PB N="157" REF="159">
trial, it had been long delayed from the difficulty of finding any proofs that wore the appearance of probability; and it remained long undecided what &s;hould be the charges, and who &s;hould be the vic|tims. The &s;ub&s;tance of the accu&s;ation was at length founded on a &s;ort of &s;por|tive party romance written by Camille De&s;moulins on Bri&s;&s;ot and the Bri&s;&s;otins; and what was meant by the author mere|ly to excite a laugh, was di&s;torted to &s;erve this horrible purpo&s;e. Camille, it is &s;aid, remon&s;trated loudly on this perver&s;ion of his intentions, and di&s;claimed any parti|cipation in the guilt. He declared that the charges were only extravagancies of his own imagination, and that he could not &s;upport any of them by evidence. This remon&s;trance was ineffectual, and the romance formed part of the indict|ment, which was filled up with charges of royali&s;m and federali&s;m; which being pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;embly for their &s;anc|tion,
<PB N="158" REF="160">
the decree of accu&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed with|out a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es in &s;upport of the charges con&s;i&s;ted principally of the chiefs of the municipality of Paris, who were the ori|ginal accu&s;ers. But the defence which the pri&s;oners made was &s;o entirely de|&s;tructive of the accu&s;ation, that though the judges and the jury had bound up their nature to this execrable deed; though the audience, like the tribunes of the Jacobins and the convention, were hired to applaud this crime, the eloquence of the accu&s;ed drew iron tears down their cheeks, and convinced the whole tribu|nal of the infamy and fal&s;ehood of the charges. Imagine the remor&s;e with which the minds of the jury mu&s;t have been wrung when their employment compell|ed them to dre&s;s out matter for condem|nation from the ab&s;urd and lying fables of the con&s;pirators, who were called as witne&s;&s;es to the indictment; while, to the
<PB N="159" REF="161">
demon&s;tration even of the mo&s;t perver&s;e and ignorant, the pri&s;oners refuted every charge with triumph on their accu&s;ers; and if any &s;u&s;picion had exi&s;ted with re|&s;pect to their patrioti&s;m or love of the republic, the pro&s;ecution would have &s;erved to di&s;pel it.</P>
<P>The judges, as well as the jury, al|though determined to execute their a|trocious commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aw that the defence of the pri&s;oners would carry conviction to the minds of the audience, who, not|with&s;tanding their being hired by the ac|cu&s;ers, began to &s;hew &s;igns of compa&s;&s;ion. The court, therefore, wrote to the con|vention to inform them, that if the trials were permitted to proceed, the formali|ties of the law would reduce them to ex|treme difficulties; and ob&s;erved, that in a revolutionary proce&s;s it was not nece&s;|&s;ary to be incumbered with trouble&s;ome witne&s;&s;es, or a long defence. This hu|mane epi&s;tle was &s;upported by a deputa|tion
<PB N="160" REF="162">
of the Jacobins, who &s;poke a &s;till plainer language, by demanding a decree, that the accu&s;ed &s;hould be condemned whenever the jury &s;hould feel them&s;elves "&s;ufficiently in&s;tructed," without attend|ing to the whole of the charge, or hear|ing what the pri&s;oners might have to al|lege in their defence. To this mea&s;ure the &s;ociety was urged by the municipal witne&s;&s;es, who were &s;tung with &s;hame at &s;eeing their perjuries unveiled.</P>
<P>The decree, empowering the jury to &s;top the pro&s;ecution at whatever period they thought proper, was virtually pro|nouncing the &s;entence of death: and the tribunal, relea&s;ing them&s;elves from the torture they were compelled to &s;uffer, while their con&s;ciences were every hour more and more loaded with the convic|tion of the innocence of the victims who&s;e judicial murder they were bound to perpetrate, lo&s;t no time in declaring that they were &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">
Alas! in what were "they &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed?" That the men they were go|ing to condemn, were tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for talents, and mo&s;t devoted to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the re|public, of which they were the founders. Were not this &s;anguinary jury &s;ufficient|ly in&s;tructed, that it was for their virtues, and not their crimes, that the&s;e victims had been dragged before them? and yet, with all this conviction on their minds, they coolly commanded the murder.</P>
<P>This atrocious condemnation was re|mon&s;trated again&s;t by the pri&s;oners in vain. In vain they alleged, that again&s;t &s;ome of them no evidence whatever had been heard; that their names had &s;carcely been mentioned at the tribunal; and that, whatever pretence the jury might have for calling them&s;elves &s;ufficiently in|&s;tructed re&s;pecting the re&s;t, they could not be informed of the crimes of tho&s;e again&s;t whom no witne&s;&s;es had appeared.
<PB N="162" REF="164">
The court, &s;heltering them&s;elves under the &s;anction of a decree, were little in|clined to give the rea&s;ons of their con|viction; and therefore replied to the arguments of the pri&s;oners, by ordering the military force to take them from the tribunal. Valaz&eacute;, in a tran&s;port of in|dignation, &s;tabbed him&s;elf before the court. Bri&s;&s;ot, Vergniaud, Gen&s;onn&eacute;, La Source, Fonfrede, Sillery, Ducos, Carra, Duperret, Gardien, Duprat, Fau|cher, Beauvais, Ducha&s;tel, Mainvielle, La Caze, Le Hardy, Boileau, Anteboul, and Vig&eacute;e, were led to execution on the following day. Vergniaud, having a pre|&s;age of his impending fate, had early provided him&s;elf with poi&s;on; but find|ing that his young friends Fonfrede and Ducos, who he had &s;ome hope would be &s;pared, were companions of his misfor|tune, he gave the phial to the officer of the guard, re&s;olving to wait the appoint|ed moment, and to peri&s;h with them.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165">
They met their &s;ate with all the calm of innocence, and breathed their la&s;t vows for the &s;afety and liberty of the re|public. Tho&s;e who were the melancholy witne&s;&s;es of their la&s;t hours in pri&s;on, love to relate how they &s;poke, and felt, and acted. I have been told by one who was their fellow pri&s;oner and friend, that their minds were in &s;uch a &s;tate of eleva|tion, that no one could approach them with the common-place and ordinary topics of con&s;olation. Bri&s;&s;ot was &s;erious and thoughtful, and at times an air of di&s;content clouded his brow; but it was evident that he mourned over the fate of his country and not his own. Gen&s;onn&eacute;, firm and &s;elf-collected, &s;eemed fearful of &s;ullying his lips by mentioning the names of his murderers. He did not utter a word re&s;pecting his own &s;ituation, but made many ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of the republic, and expre&s;&s;ed his ardent wi&s;hes for its happine&s;s. Vergniaud was
<PB N="164" REF="166">
&s;ometimes &s;erious, and &s;ometimes gay. He amu&s;ed his fellow-pri&s;oners at times with the recital of poetry which he re|tained in his memory, and &s;ometimes in|dulged them with the la&s;t touches of that &s;ublime eloquence which was now for ever lo&s;t to the world. Fonfrede and Ducos relieved the &s;ombre of the piece by the habitual liveline&s;s of their charac|ters, although each lamented the fate of his brother to their re&s;pective friends, and &s;ometimes &s;hed tears over the di&s;tre&s;s and ruin of their wives and children; for both had young families and immen&s;e fortunes. Their courage was the more exemplary, as their fate was altogether unexpected.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to the impri&s;onment of the deputies, while they were yet under ar|re&s;t in their own hou&s;es, I frequently vi&s;ited tho&s;e who were in the number of our friends. Vergniaud had long told me that he &s;aw no ju&s;t foundation for
<PB N="165" REF="167">
hope, and that he would rather die, than live a witne&s;s of his country's &s;hame. Fonfrede and Ducos had the full enjoy|ment of their liberty till the act of accu|&s;ation appeared, in which they had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that they &s;hould be in|cluded. The day previous to the read|ing of this murderous pro&s;cription in the convention, Fonfrede had accompanied us to Montmorenci, about four leagues from Paris, where we had wandered till evening, amid&s;t that enchanting &s;cenery which Rou&s;&s;eau once inhabited, and which he had &s;o luxuriantly de&s;cribed. Alas! while the charms of nature had &s;oothed our imaginations, and made us forget awhile the &s;cenes of moral defor|mity exhibited in the polluted city we had left; while every thing around us breathed delight, and the land&s;cape was a hymn to the Almighty; the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were at their bloody work, and plotting the murder of our friends. The next
<PB N="166" REF="168">
day Fonfrede was &s;ent to the Conciergerie, and we &s;aw him no more. A week after we were our&s;elves arre&s;ted. He conveyed to us, from his dungeon, his &s;ympathy in our misfortunes, and, after his con|demnation, wrote to bid us a la&s;t fare|well; but the letter was carried to the committee of general &s;afety, and never reached us.</P>
<P>They were condemned at midnight. When they returned to their pri&s;on, they gave the appointed &s;ignal of their fate to their fellow-pri&s;oners, who&s;e &s;eclu&s;ion afforded them no other means of know|ing it, by &s;inging a parody of the chorus of the Mar&s;eillois hymn&mdash;

<P>After &s;pending the few hours of life that remained, in conver&s;ation, now and then enlivened by the &s;allies of the young and gay among&s;t them, they bade adieu
<PB N="167" REF="169">
to their fellow-pri&s;oners, who&s;e minds were &s;o rai&s;ed by the heroi&s;m which the&s;e patriots di&s;played, that it was &s;ome time before they became &s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The dungeon which they inhabited was &s;hewn with profound veneration to every pri&s;oner who afterwards arrived at this preparatory &s;cene of murder. A &s;u|per&s;titious re&s;pect was paid to the mi&s;er|able matra&s;s of Vergniaud; and tho&s;e who felt neither the force of their pa|trioti&s;m, nor &s;hared in their love for their country, were taught to pronounce with religious awe the names of the&s;e martyrs of liberty.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e lamented patriots known all the foulne&s;s of the crimes which the con|&s;pirators were meditating again&s;t them, it would have been ea&s;y to have withdrawn them&s;elves from their vengeance, as many of their pro&s;cribed colleagues did.

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my la&s;t letter was written, I have left Switzerland, and returned to Paris, and have had the un&s;peakable joy of embracing my family again. I have not yet mentioned to you (for till the Jacobins were de&s;troyed it was too &s;oon to relate) that I for&s;ook home to return no more while Robe&s;pierre ex|i&s;ted; and Robe&s;pierre was then in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hed dominion, the &s;pirit of liberty had &s;o bowed it&s;elf be|neath the axe of the guillotine, from the pa&s;toral hills of Normandy to the orange|groves of Nice, from the en&s;anguined banks of the Loire to the mourning waters of Vauclu&s;e, that when my mo|ther, while &s;he gave me her la&s;t embrace at parting, told me &s;he &s;hould &s;ee me
<PB N="170" REF="172">
no more, my de&s;ponding heart a&s;&s;ented to the &s;ad prediction. Upon the fall of the deputies who were pro&s;cribed the 31&s;t of May, and who were well known to have honoured us with their friend|&s;hip, we became a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at the committee of public &s;afety, and a mandat d'arr&ecirc;t would certainly have been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t us if we had not al|ready been impri&s;oned in con&s;equence of the law again&s;t the Engli&s;h. By &s;haring the general misfortune of our country|men in France, we were &s;heltered from any particular mark of vengeance. We afterwards obtained our liberty by means of the municipality, to whom we were unknown; and when the murderers had &s;atiated their vengeance in the blood of our friends, my family had no longer any peculiar danger to fear. But my &s;ituation was far different, During the &s;pring preceding the fatal 31&s;t of May, when the deputies of the Gironde, and
<PB N="171" REF="173">
Barrere, pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of their evenings at our hou&s;e, I had not concealed that I was employed in writing &s;ome letters which have &s;ince been publi&s;hed in England, in which I had drawn the por|trait of the tyrant in tho&s;e dark &s;hades of colouring that belonged to his hideous nature; and Barrere, in who&s;e power my life was placed, was now the lacquey of Robe&s;pierre, and the great inqui&s;itor of the Engli&s;h at Paris. He had now &s;eared his con&s;cience with crimes, and bathed his hands in the blood of the innocent. What &s;till increa&s;ed my danger was, that Barrere could not but recollect, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his pre&s;ent vilene&s;s in our eyes, the political &s;entiments which he had expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e hours of &s;ocial confidence, when had he been told that he &s;hould become the accomplice of un|recorded horrors, he would have an&s;wer|ed with the feelings of Hazael, "Is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this
<PB N="172" REF="174">
thing?" He could not but recollect that on the third of June, the day after the in&s;urrection, he came to our hou&s;e with looks di&s;ordered and haggard, with eyes filled with tears, and a mind that &s;eemed bur&s;ting with indignant &s;orrow; repeatedly declaring that, &s;ince the na|tional repre&s;entation was violated, liberty was lo&s;t; deploring the fate of the Gi|ronde, above all of Vergniaud, and ex|ecrating the Jacobins, and the commune of Paris. A thou&s;and times he wi&s;hed that he could tran&s;port him&s;elf to the foot of his native mountains, the Pyre|n&eacute;es, bid adieu for ever to the polluted city of Paris, and wander for the re&s;t of his life amid&s;t that &s;ublime &s;cenery which he de&s;cribed with melancholy en|thu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>It was not a little dangerous to have heard &s;uch &s;entiments from the lips of one who afterwards &s;aid boa&s;tingly in the convention, "ll n'y a que les morts
<PB N="173" REF="175">
qui ne reviennent pas;"&mdash;of one who became the leader of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; and who, mounting the tribune with the light &s;tep of gaiety, dre&s;&s;ed up with point and epigram tho&s;e atrocious edicts of the committee to which his bleeding coun|try an&s;wered with her groans. Barrere al&s;o knew that there was no danger of my declaring the&s;e things at the revolu|tionary tribunal, &s;ince tho&s;e who were tried were not permitted to &s;peak: and he had no longer any ties of acquaint|ance with us which might have re&s;train|ed him from &s;uch conduct; &s;ince very &s;oon after the 31&s;t of May, upon our re|fu&s;ing to receive &s;ome deputies of the mountain whom he a&s;ked leave to intro|duce to us, he abandoned us altogether.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h new&s;|papers came regularly to the committee of public &s;afety, in which pa&s;&s;ages from my letters were frequently tran&s;cribed, and the work mentioned as mine; and
<PB N="174" REF="176">
tho&s;e papers were con&s;tantly tran&s;lated into French for the members of the com|mittee. Two copies of the work had al&s;o reached Paris; and although one was at my reque&s;t de&s;troyed, the other might, by means of tho&s;e domiciliary vi&s;its which were &s;o often repeated, have been thrown into the hands of revolutionary commi&s;|&s;aries.</P>
<P>Thus I pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Paris, with the knife of the guillotine &s;u&s;pended over me by a frail thread, when a &s;ingu|lar opportunity of e&s;cape pre&s;ented it|&s;elf, and I fled to Switzerland, with a heart almo&s;t broken by the crimes I had witne&s;&s;ed, and the calamities I had &s;hared. I for&s;ook tho&s;e who were mo&s;t dear to me on earth, with no other con&s;olation than that I left them expo&s;ed only to the com|mon danger of every individual in the country, and relieved from the cruel ap|prehen&s;ions they had felt on my account.</P>
<P>I proceeded on my journey haunted
<PB N="175" REF="177">
by the images of gens d'armes, who I fancied were pur&s;uing me, and with a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious per&s;ua&s;ion that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould e&s;cape. I felt as if &s;ome magical &s;pell would chain my feet at the frontier of France, which &s;eemed to me a boundary that was impa&s;&s;able. As I approached the frontier the agita|tion of my &s;pirits increa&s;ed, and when I reached Bourg-Libre, the la&s;t French po&s;t where commi&s;&s;aries were appointed to examine the pa&s;&s;ports and tho&s;e who pre&s;ented them; my heart &s;unk within me, and I tried to re&s;ign my&s;elf to a fate which &s;eemed to my di&s;ordered mind inevitable. But I found that I had di&s;|quieted my&s;elf in vain: revolutionary government had relaxed its iron nerve at this di&s;tance from the &s;eat of tyranny; and the commi&s;&s;aries on the frontiers, after having performed their office with the milde&s;t urbanity, &s;uffered us to pro|ceed

to Ba&s;il, which is only half a league farther.</P>
<P>Some tall &s;takes driven into the earth at certain di&s;tances mark the limits of France and Switzerland. We drove ra|pidly pa&s;t them, and were then beyond the reach of revolutionary government, and the axe of the guillotine.</P>
<P>At Ba&s;il, now almo&s;t the only &s;ocial &s;peck on Europe's wide &s;urface, where men meet for any other purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of mutual de&s;truction, I was in &s;afety: but I was an exile from my fa|mily&mdash;from the only friends I had left&mdash;my friends in England, to whom I had written immediately on my arrival, in the fulne&s;s of my heart and with the fond per&s;ua&s;ion that they had trembled for my &s;afety and would rejoice in my deliverance, having (with few excep|tions indeed!) returned no an&s;wers to my letters. With what overwhelming
<PB N="177" REF="179">
&s;en&s;ations did I receive the tidings of the fall of Robe&s;pierre, which was to change the colour of my life, and give peace and con&s;olation to &s;o many millions of my fellow-creatures! After waiting till the &s;truggle maintained by the Jacobins again&s;t the national repre&s;entation had hap|pily ended, I returned to Paris. On enter|ing again that polluted city, a thou&s;and fatal recollections ru&s;hed upon my mind, a thou&s;and local &s;en&s;ations overwhelmed my &s;pirit.

That part of the convent

which the municipality had allotted for our pri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting only of bare walls, we were each of us permitted to return to our re&s;pective hou&s;es, in order to pro|vide our&s;elves with beds, and what fur|niture and clothes we thought proper. We were attended thither by an in&s;pector of the police and guards, together with one of the commi&s;&s;aries of our own &s;ection, who had put the &s;eals on our apartments, and who on removing them examined our pa|pers, con&s;i&s;ting now only of a few poeti|cal &s;craps which had e&s;caped the flames. Odes, elegies, and &s;onnets were in&s;tantly bundled up and &s;ent to the municipality, notwith&s;tanding my a&s;&s;urances that the mu&s;es to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, far

from being accomplices in any con&s;pi|racy again&s;t liberty, had in all ages been its warme&s;t auxiliaries. With what melan|choly &s;en&s;ations did we re-vi&s;it that home from which we were again to be torn in a few hours! How often did my eyes wander over every object in our apart|ment! The chairs and tables, which we found in the &s;ame po&s;ition as we had left them on our fir&s;t impri&s;onment, &s;eemed like mute friends whom it was angui&s;h to leave, and who&s;e well-known atti|tudes recalled the comforts of the pa&s;t. With aching hearts we were once more led through the &s;treets of Paris to our new pri&s;on. This convent, called Les Anglai&s;es, was &s;till inhabited by twenty-three Engli&s;h nuns, and, as it was their own property, had not &s;hared the gene|ral fate of the mona&s;tic edifices. While the French monks and nuns had for more than a year before this period been driven from their retreats, the religious
<PB N="183" REF="185">
hou&s;es both of men and women, which belonged to the Engli&s;h, had been re|&s;pected, and their inhabitants left un|di&s;turbed. The Engli&s;h or rather Iri&s;h monks had, however, long &s;ince thrown off their habits, and conformed as well as they were able to the new &s;y&s;tem of opinions. But this was not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e religious &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic attachment to the external &s;igns of their profe&s;&s;ion was greater, and their worldly wi&s;dom le&s;s. The inhabitants of the fauxbourg St. Antoine where they re&s;ided, accu&s;tomed from infancy to revere them, to have the wants of the poor &s;upplied at the gate of the convent, and, while under the former government they were treated with neglect or di&s;dain by others, to be there received with evangelical hu|mility, felt that their e&s;teem and vene|ration for the nuns had &s;urvived their own &s;uper&s;titious belief. The conquer|ors of the Ba&s;tile, the terror of ari&s;to|cracy,
<PB N="184" REF="186">
and the vanguard of revolutions, laying a&s;ide their bloody pikes and bayo|nets, humbled them&s;elves before the&s;e holy &s;i&s;ters, whom a &s;ort of vi&s;ible &s;anctity &s;eemed to encompa&s;s, and whom they &s;uffered, notwith&s;tanding the general re|gulation, to wear the cheri&s;hed &s;ymbols of their order, the veil and the cro&s;s, and &s;even times a day to ring the bell for prayers. When we had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entinels who guarded the convent, the gate was unlocked for our admi&s;&s;ion by a nun in her habit. She embraced us with affectionate warmth, and, addre&s;&s;ing us in Engli&s;h, begged we would be com|forted, &s;ince &s;he and the other nuns who were to have the charge of us were our countrywomen and our &s;i&s;ters. This &s;oothing &s;ympathy, expre&s;&s;ed in our native language, formed &s;uch a contra&s;t to the rude accents of in&s;pectors of po|lice, that it &s;eemed as if &s;ome pitying angel had leaned from heaven to com|fort

us. The kindne&s;s with which we were received by our amiable country|women, contributed to reconcile us to our chamber, which might more pro|perly be called a pa&s;&s;age to other rooms, where the glowing tape&s;try of the Luxembourg was exchanged for plai&s;|tered walls, and where we had to &s;uffer phy&s;ical as well as moral evils, the weather being inten&s;ely cold, and our wretched gallery having neither &s;tove nor chimney. One circum&s;tance tended to make our &s;ituation tolerable, which was that true &s;pirit of fraternity that pre|vailed in our community, con&s;i&s;ting of about forty female pri&s;oners be&s;ides the nuns. Into how happy a region would the world be transformed, if that mutual forbearance and amity were to be found in it which had power to cheer even the gloom of a pri&s;on!</P>
<P>In addition to the tie of common ca|lamity was the tie of a common coun|try;
<PB N="186" REF="188">
and in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation this bond of union appeared &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;eem|ed, as Dr. John&s;on &s;aid of family rela|tions, that we were born each others friends. It was the general &s;tudy of the whole community to prevent each others wi&s;hes. There were no rich among&s;t us. The rich had made them&s;elves wings, and vani&s;hed away before the promul|gation of the law again&s;t the Engli&s;h; but tho&s;e who had &s;till any re&s;ources left, &s;hared all their little luxuries and indulgencies with tho&s;e that had none. The young &s;uccoured the old, the ac|tive &s;erved the infirm, and the gay cheered the dejected. There were in|deed among us a few per&s;ons, who born of French parents, having pa&s;&s;ed their whole lives in France, and not &s;peaking one word of our native lan|guage, &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed to find by their impri&s;onment that they were En|gli&s;h women. They had no trace or
<PB N="187" REF="189">
recollection of that country which in evil hour chanced to give them birth, and did not ea&s;ily reconcile them&s;elves to the grated convent, while their French &s;i&s;ters were enjoying perfect liberty.</P>
<P>When &s;uch of the former nobility who were our fellow-pri&s;oners at the Luxem|bourg heard that we were going to be transferred to the fauxbourg St. Antoine, they gathered round us to expre&s;s their fears for our &s;afety in that frightful quar|ter of the city. I was per&s;uaded, on the contrary, that we had much more to fear while &s;hut up in this &s;tate pri&s;on with them&s;elves, than in the fauxbourg St. Antoine, the inhabitants of which were chiefly compo&s;ed of workmen and me|chanics, who in the cour&s;e of the revo|lution had acted too much in union to be led to perpetrate any partial mi&s;chief; &s;ince tho&s;e immen&s;e numbers which had power to overthrow government could not be bribed to commit ma&s;&s;acres.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
The admini&s;trators of the police, when they ordered preparations to be made for our reception, announced us to the &s;ec|tion as being all the wives and daughters of milords anglois. This was no au&s;|picious introduction: accordingly our fir&s;t care was to lay a&s;ide the honours and dignities conferred upon us by the of|ficers of the police, and which certainly would not have been confirmed by the herald's office. The only di&s;tinction we now envied was that of belonging to the privileged cla&s;s who gained their bread by the labour of their hands, and who alone were exempted from the penalties of the law. We would thankfully have con&s;ented to purcha&s;e at the price of toil the &s;weets of liberty, when bereaved of which the &s;ickening &s;oul grows weary of exi&s;tence. In vain we tried to twine the flowers of &s;ocial plea&s;ure around the bars of our pri&s;on; in vain we "took the viol and the harp, or endeavoured to re|joice
<PB N="189" REF="191">
at the &s;ound of the organ." That good which alone gives value to every other, was wanting; and mu&s;ic was di&s;|cordant, and conver&s;ation joyle&s;s.</P>
<P>Having repelled the calumnious report of our nobility, the revolutionary com|mittee of our &s;ection, under who&s;e in|&s;pection we were placed, and who vi&s;ited us in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion every day, began to look upon us with a more propitious eye; and le&s;t our health &s;hould be impaired by confinement, they unlocked the garden gate, of the key of which &s;ince our ar|rival they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to pre|vent any attempts to &s;cale the walls, and permitted us to walk two hours every day accompanied by them&s;elves. Dur|ing the&s;e walks we found means to con|vince them that we had been guilty of no other offence again&s;t the &s;tate, than that of being born in England; and the common principles of ju&s;tice taught the&s;e unlettered patriots to lament the &s;everity of
<PB N="190" REF="192">
our fate, which they endeavoured to &s;often by every mark of hone&s;t kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The vi&s;its of the admini&s;tration of po|lice were far le&s;s agreeable than tho&s;e of our good commi&s;&s;aries. The fir&s;t time they came, Brutus, one of their &s;ecre|taries, fired with uncontrollable rage at the &s;ight of the nun who unlocked the gate for his admi&s;&s;ion, rudely &s;eized her veil, which he was with difficulty pre|vented from tearing off her face. This ferocious pagan threw down the cro&s;s which was erected in the garden, and trampled it under foot; and having pour|ed forth a volley of imprecations again&s;t the great bell, which &s;till hung at the &s;teeple in&s;tead of being transformed into a cannon, he left the di&s;mayed nuns trembling with horror, and ha&s;tened to denounce the veils, the cro&s;&s;es, and the great bell at the municipality. The next morning Pache, the mayor of Paris, &s;ent orders for the bell to be taken down, the
<PB N="191" REF="193">
cro&s;&s;es to be removed, and the nuns to throw off their habits immediately. No|thing could exceed their de&s;pair upon receiving this municipal mandate. The convent re&s;ounded with lamentations, and the veils which were now to be ca&s;t off were bathed with tears.</P>
<P>There was, however, little time to be allowed to the indulgence of unavailing &s;orrow. Brutus might return, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to action. Accord|ingly, a council of caps was called in the room of the &s;uperior; and after a deli|beration, &s;ometimes interrupted by &s;ighs and &s;ometimes by plea&s;antry, we all went to work, and in a few hours &s;weeping trains were converted into gowns, and flowing veils into bonnets. One charm|ing young nun, who was a pen&s;ive en|thu&s;ia&s;t, begged that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, her bonnet might &s;hroud her face al|together; while another, who&s;e regards were not entirely turned away from this
<PB N="192" REF="194">
world, hinted that &s;he &s;hould have no ob|jection to the decoration of a bow.</P>
<P>My chief con&s;olation during my con|finement aro&s;e from the &s;ociety of &s;i&s;ter There&s;a, that amiable nun who &s;o much wi&s;hed to hide a face which nature had formed to excite love and admiration. It was impo&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e with her with|out feeling that the revolution was a ble&s;&s;|ing, if it was only for having prohibited vows which robbed &s;ociety of tho&s;e who were formed to be its delight and orna|ment. I never met with a human crea|ture who &s;eemed to approach nearer to the ideas we form of angelic purity, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more corrected &s;pirit, or a more tender heart. Devotion was her fir&s;t delight, her unfailing &s;ource of hap|pine&s;s; and &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of regret|ting her fate, I envied her feelings, and was tempted to exclaim with Pope,<Q><L>How happy is the blamele&s;s ve&s;tal's lot,</L>
<L>The world forgetting, by the world forgot!</L>
<L><PB N="193" REF="195">

<P>We were allowed the melancholy in|dulgence of &s;eeing our friends through an iron grate; and there were &s;till among the French &s;ome per&s;ons who&s;e courageous friend&s;hip, undi&s;mayed by all the frowns of power, and the increa&s;ing terrors of revolutionary mea&s;ures, did not abandon us in our pri&s;on. The greater part of the Engli&s;h who were yet in France, hav|ing been e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country for years, had acquired &s;ome friends who la|mented their misfortunes, and who ri&s;qued their own per&s;onal &s;afety by making un|wearied efforts for their deliverance. The dre&s;s of our vi&s;itors was indeed not a little grote&s;que, the period being now arrived when the vi&s;ible &s;igns of patrioti&s;m were dirty linen, pantaloons, uncombed hair,
<PB N="194" REF="196">
red caps, or black wigs, and all, as Ro&s;a|lind &s;ays, "denoting a carele&s;s di&s;order." The ob&s;olete term of <HI>mu&s;cadin,</HI> which means a &s;cented fop, was revived; and every man who had the boldne&s;s to ap|pear in a clean &s;hirt was branded with that appellation, and every woman who wore a hat was a <HI>mu&s;cadine</HI>; for the pe|riod was &s;till remembered when a round cap was the badge of roture, nor were the ari&s;tocratical preten&s;ions of the hat yet buried in oblivion. It is remarkable enough, that at this period Robe&s;pierre always appeared not only dre&s;&s;ed with neatne&s;s, but with &s;ome degree of ele|gance, and, while he called him&s;elf the leader of the &s;ans-culottes, never adopted the co&s;tume of his band. His hideous countenance, far from being involved in a black wig, was decorated with hair care|fully arranged, and nicely powdered; while he endeavoured to hide tho&s;e emo|tions of his inhuman &s;oul which his eyes
<PB N="195" REF="197">
might &s;ometimes have betrayed, beneath a large pair of green &s;pectacles, though he had no defect in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>At this period one of the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed women that France has pro|duced peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold. This lady was Madame Roland, the wife of the late mini&s;ter. On the 31&s;t of May he had fled from his per&s;ecutors, and his wife who remained was carried to pri&s;on. The wits ob&s;erved on this occa|&s;ion, that the body of Roland was mi&s;|&s;ing, but that he had left his &s;oul be|hind. Madame Roland was indeed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, and a mind highly cultivated by the &s;tudy of literature. I had been acquainted with her &s;ince I fir&s;t came to France, and had always ob&s;erved in her conver&s;ation the mo&s;t ardent attachment to liberty, and the mo&s;t enlarged &s;entiments of philanthropy; &s;entiments which &s;he developed with an eloquence peculiar to her&s;elf, with a flow
<PB N="196" REF="198">
and power of expre&s;&s;ion which gave new graces and new energy to the French language. With the&s;e extraordinary en|dowments of mind &s;he united all the warmth of a feeling heart, and all the charms of the mo&s;t elegant manners. She was tall and well &s;haped, her air was dignified, and although more than thirty-five years of age &s;he was &s;till hand&s;ome. Her countenance had an expre&s;&s;ion of un|common &s;weetne&s;s, and her full dark eyes beamed with the brighte&s;t rays of intelli|gence. I vi&s;ited her in the pri&s;on of St. Pelagie, where her &s;oul, &s;uperior to cir|cum&s;tances, retained its accu&s;tomed &s;e|renity, and &s;he conver&s;ed with the &s;ame animated cheerfulne&s;s in her little cell as &s;he u&s;ed to do in the hotel of the mini&s;ter. She had provided her&s;elf with a few books, and I found her reading Plutarch. She told me &s;he expected to die; and the look of placid re&s;ignation with which &s;he &s;poke of it, convinced me that &s;he was
<PB N="197" REF="199">
prepared to meet death with a firmne&s;s worthy of her exalted character. When I enquired after her daughter, an only child of thirteen years of age, &s;he bur&s;t into tears; and at the overwhelming recol|lection of her hu&s;band and her child, the courage of the victim of liberty was lo&s;t in the feelings of the wife and the mo|ther.</P>
<P>Immediately after the murder of the Gironde &s;he was &s;ent to the Conciergerie, like them to undergo the mockery of a trial, and like them to peri&s;h. When brought before the revolutionary tribunal &s;he pre&s;erved the mo&s;t heroical firmne&s;s, though &s;he was treated with &s;uch barba|rity, and in&s;ulted by que&s;tions &s;o injurious to her honour, that &s;ometimes the tears of indignation &s;tarted from her eyes. This celebrated woman, who at the bar of the national convention had by the commanding graces of her eloquence forced even from her enemies the tribute
<PB N="198" REF="200">
of applau&s;e and admiration, was now in the hands of vulgar wretches, by whom her fine talents, far from being appreciated, were not even under&s;tood. I &s;hall tran|&s;cribe a copy of her defence taken from her own manu&s;cript<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. III.</NOTE>. With keen regret I mu&s;t add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, that &s;ome papers in her ju&s;|tification, which &s;he &s;ent me from her pri|&s;on, perhaps with a view that at &s;ome happier period, when the voice of inno|cence might be heard, I &s;hould make them public, I was compelled to de&s;troy, the night on which I was my&s;elf arre&s;ted; &s;ince, had they been found in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they would inevitably have involved me in her fate. Before I took this re&s;olution, which co&s;t me a cruel effort, I employed every means in my power to pre&s;erve tho&s;e precious memorials, in vain; for I could find no per&s;on who would venture to keep them amid&s;t the terrors of domiciliary vi&s;its, and the certainty, if they were found,
<PB N="199" REF="201">
of being put to death as an accomplice of the writer. But her fair fame &s;tands in no need of &s;uch te&s;timonials: her memory is embalmed in the minds of the wi&s;e and good, as one of tho&s;e glorious martyrs who have &s;ealed with their blood the li|berties of their country. After hearing her &s;entence, &s;he &s;aid, "Vous me jugez digne de partager le &s;ort des grands hom|mes que vous avez a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in&eacute;s.

<P>On the day of her trial &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf in white: her long dark hair flowed loo&s;ely to her wai&s;t, and her figure would have &s;oftened any hearts le&s;s ferocious than tho&s;e of her judges. On her way to the &s;caffold &s;he was not only compo&s;ed, but &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umed an air of gaiety,

To be the fir&s;t victim was there|fore con&s;idered as a privilege, and had been allowed to Madame Roland as a woman. But when &s;he ob&s;erved the di&s;|may of her companion, &s;he &s;aid to him, "Allez le premier: que je vous &eacute;par|gne au moins la douleur de voir couler mon &s;ang<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Go fir&s;t: let me at lea&s;t &s;pare you the pain of &s;eeing my blood &s;hed."</NOTE>." She then turned to the executioner, and begged that this &s;ad in|dulgence might be granted to her fellow &s;ufferer. The executioner told her that
<PB N="201" REF="203">
he had received orders that &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h fir&s;t. "But you cannot, I am &s;ure," &s;aid &s;he with a &s;mile, "refu&s;e the la&s;t reque&s;t of a lady." The execu|tioner complied with her demand. When &s;he mounted the &s;caffold, and was tied to the fatal plank, &s;he lifted up her eyes to the &s;tatue of Liberty, near which the guil|lotine was placed, and exclaimed, "Ah Libert&eacute;, comme on t'a jou&eacute;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Ah Liberty! how ha&s;t thou been &s;ported with!"</NOTE>!" The next moment &s;he peri&s;hed. But her name will be recorded in the annals of hi&s;tory, as one of tho&s;e illu&s;trious women who&s;e &s;uperior attainments &s;eem fitted to exalt her &s;ex in the &s;cale of being.</P>
<P>She had predicted that her hu&s;band would not &s;urvive her lo&s;s, and her pre|diction was fulfilled. Roland, who had concealed him&s;elf till this period, no &s;ooner heard the fate of his wife, who&s;e

influence over his mind had often been a &s;ubject of reproach among&s;t his ene|mies, than, feeling that life was no longer worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, he put an end to his exi&s;tence. His body was found in a wood near the high-road between Paris and Rouen: the papers which were in his pocket-book were &s;ent to the com|mittee of general &s;afety, and have never &s;een the light. His unhappy daughter found an a&s;ylum with an old friend of her pro&s;cribed parents, who had the courage to receive her at a period when it was imminently dangerous to afford her protection. But the time probably now draws near when this child will be adopt|ed by her country, and an honourable provi&s;ion will be made for her, as a te&s;|timony of national gratitude towards tho&s;e who gave her birth.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the extraordinary changes which were pa&s;&s;ing in France, the con|vention now changed time it&s;elf, and decreed the new calendar. A report was
<PB N="203" REF="205">
made on it, &s;o philo&s;ophical and &s;o plea|&s;ing to the imagination, that, amid&s;t the &s;anguinary mea&s;ures of tho&s;e days, it &s;eemed to the oppre&s;&s;ed heart what a &s;o|litary &s;pot of fre&s;h verdure appears to the eye amid&s;t the craggine&s;s of louring rocks, or the gloom of &s;avage de&s;erts. Love of change is natural to &s;orrow; and for my own part I felt my&s;elf &s;o little obliged to the months of my for|mer acquaintance, which as they pa&s;&s;ed over my head had generally brought &s;ucce&s;&s;ive evils in their train, or &s;erved as the anniver&s;aries of &s;ome melancholy epocha, that I was not much di&s;plea&s;ed to part with them for months with ap|pellations that bring to the mind images of nature, which in every a&s;pect has &s;ome power of giving plea&s;ure, from Nivo&s;e the month of &s;nows, to Floreal the month of flowers. I therefore &s;oon learnt to count the days of my captivity by the new calendar; which was highly nece&s;|&s;ary

Deeply affected by this &s;pecta|cle, he flew to Paris with the re&s;olution of obtaining our liberty, or of &s;haring our pri&s;on.

<P>With what delicious emotions did we return to our own habitation! After pa&s;&s;ing two months in pri&s;on at &s;uch a period, we felt the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of home in its full extent.

<P>A FEW weeks after our relea&s;e from pri&s;on, Rabaut de St. Etienne was put to death. He was one of the mo&s;t en|lightened and virtuous men whom the revolution had called forth, and had ac|quired general e&s;teem by his conduct as a legi&s;lator, and con&s;iderable reputation by his talents as a writer. He was the pre&s;ident of the famous committee of twelve, which was appointed by the convention, previou&s;ly to the 31&s;t of May, to examine into the con&s;piracies which threatened its exi&s;tence, and which, as I have already related, ha&s;tened its par|tial di&s;&s;olution. Rabaut, as often as he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to make the report, was compelled by the interruptions of the con&s;pirators and their agents to re|tire
<PB N="209" REF="211">
from the tribune, until that moment arrived, when he, together with the members of the commi&s;&s;ion, and the deputies of the Gironde, were expelled, or torn from the convention! I &s;aw him on this memorable day (for he took &s;helter for a few hours at our hou&s;e) filled with de&s;pair, not &s;o much for the lo&s;s of his own life, which he then con|&s;idered as inevitable, as for that of the liberty of his country, now falling un|der the vile&s;t de&s;poti&s;m. He e&s;caped arre&s;t on the 2d of June, from not hav|ing been pre&s;ent at the convention when the con&s;pirators con&s;ummated their crime by means of the military force of Paris, and concealed him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of a friend, with his brother, one of the &s;e|venty-three deputies who had &s;igned the prote&s;t.</P>
<P>They enclo&s;ed part of a room for their place of &s;helter, and built up the wall with their own hands, placing a book|ca&s;e
<PB N="210" REF="212">
before the entrance, &s;o that there was not the lea&s;t appearance of conceal|ment. They employed a carpenter, in whom they had great confidence, to make the door, and the wretch betrayed them. Rabaut de St. Etienne was immediately brought before the revolutionary tribu|nal to have his per&s;on identified, for he was now outlawed, which in France is the &s;entence of death. He was led to execution; and his wife, a mo&s;t amia|ble woman, unable to &s;upport the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band whom &s;he tenderly loved, put an end to her exi&s;tence. His brother was taken to the Conciergerie, where he lan|gui&s;hed with three other victims, for many months, in a &s;ubterraneous dun|geon; and there being only one bed al|lotted for four per&s;ons, he lay upon the damp floor, and contracted &s;uch violent di&s;orders, that his life was long de&s;paired of. He has now taken his &s;eat in the convention. The generous friend and
<PB N="211" REF="213" MS="y">
his wife, who had given the brothers an a&s;ylum, were al&s;o dragged to pri&s;on; and &s;ome time after were condemned, for this noble act of friend&s;hip, to peri&s;h on the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>If France, during the unrelenting ty|ranny of Robe&s;pierre, exhibited unex|ampled crimes, it was al&s;o the &s;cene of extraordinary virtue; of the mo&s;t af|fecting in&s;tances of magnanimity and kind|ne&s;s. Of this nature was the conduct of a young man, who being a pri&s;oner with his brother, happened to be pre&s;ent when the names of the victims were called over, who were &s;ummoned to appear the next day before the &s;anguinary tribunal. The young man found the name of his bro|ther, who at that moment was ab&s;ent, upon the fatal li&s;t. He pau&s;ed only an in&s;tant to reflect, that the life of the fa|ther of a large family was of more va|lue than his own: he an&s;wered the call, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the officer, and
<PB N="212" REF="214">
was executed in his brother's &s;tead. A father made the &s;ame &s;acrifice for his &s;on; for the tribunal was &s;o negligent of forms, that it was not difficult to de|ceive its vigilance.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing horrors which every day produced, had at length the effect of extingui&s;hing in every heart the love of life, that &s;entiment which clings &s;o fa&s;t to our nature. To die, and get be|yond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion, appeared a privilege; and perhaps nothing ap|palled the &s;ouls of the tyrants &s;o much as that &s;erenity with which their vic|tims went to execution. The page of hi&s;tory has held up to the admiration of &s;ucceeding ages, tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who have met death with fortitude. But had they been led among the victims of Robe&s;pierre to execution, they would have found them&s;elves, in this re&s;pect, undi&s;tingui&s;hed from the crowd. They would have &s;een per&s;ons of each &s;ex,
<PB N="213" REF="215">
of all ages, and all conditions, look|ing upon death with a contempt equal to their own. Socrates expiring &s;ur|rounded by his friends, or Seneca and Lucan &s;inking gently into death, have perhaps le&s;s claim to admiration than tho&s;e blooming beauties, who in all the fir&s;t fre&s;hne&s;s of youth, in the very &s;pring of life, &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of the executioner with placid &s;miles on their countenances, and looked like angels in their flight to heaven.</P>
<P>Among the victims of the tyrants, the women have been peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for their admirable firmne&s;s in death. Perhaps this aro&s;e from the &s;uperior &s;en|&s;ibility which belongs to the female mind, and which made it feel that it was le&s;s terrible to die, than to &s;urvive the objects of its tenderne&s;s. When the general who commanded at Longwy on its &s;urrender to the Pru&s;&s;ians was con|demned to die, his wife, a beautiful
<PB N="214" REF="216">
young woman of four-and-twenty years of age, who heard the &s;entence pro|nounced, cried out in a tone of de&s;pair, "Vive le roi!" The inhuman tribunal, in&s;tead of attributing her conduct to di&s;|traction, condemned her to die. Her hu&s;band, when he was placed in the cart, was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment and angui&s;h when he &s;aw his beloved wife led towards it. The people, &s;hocked at the &s;pectacle, followed her to the &s;caffold, crying, "Elle n'a pas m&eacute;rit&eacute; la mort." "Mes amis," &s;aid &s;he, "c'e&s;t ma faute; j'ai voulu p&eacute;rir avec mon mari<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"She did not de&s;erve death."&mdash;"My friends, it is my own fault; I was re&s;olved to peri&s;h with my hu&s;band."</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The fury of the&s;e implacable mon&s;ters &s;eemed directed with peculiar virulence again&s;t that &s;ex, who&s;e weakne&s;s man was de&s;tined by nature to &s;upport. The &s;caffold was every day bathed with the
<PB N="215" REF="217">
blood of women. Some who had been condemned to die, but had been re|&s;pited on account of their pregnancy, were dragged to death immediately after their delivery, in that &s;tate of weakne&s;s which &s;avages would have re&s;pected. One unfortunate woman, the wife of a pea&s;ant, had been brought to Paris, with nineteen other women of the &s;ame cla&s;s, and condemned to die with her com|panions. She heard her &s;entence without emotion; but when they came to carry her to execution, and take away the infant who was hanging at her brea&s;t, and receiving that nouri&s;hment of which death was &s;o &s;oon to dry up the &s;ource, &s;he rent the air with her cries, with the &s;trong &s;hriek of in&s;tinctive affection, the piercing throes of maternal tender|ne&s;s&mdash;But in vain! the infant was torn from the bo&s;om that cheri&s;hed it, and the agonies of the unfortunate mother found re&s;pite in death.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218">
Fourteen young girls of Verdun, who had danced at a ball given by the Pru&s;|&s;ians, were led to the &s;caffold together, and looked like nymphs adorned for a fe&s;tival. Sometimes whole generations were &s;wept away at one moment; and the tribunal exhibited many a family|piece, which has almo&s;t broken the heart of humanity. Male&s;herbes, the coun&s;el of Louis XVI, was condemned to die, at eighty years of age, with his daughter, and &s;on-in-law, his grand|daughter and grand-&s;on.</P>
<P>His daughter &s;eemed to have lo&s;t &s;ight of every earthly object but her venera|ble parent: &s;he embraced him a thou|&s;and times on the way to execution; bathed his face with her tears; and when the mini&s;ter of death dragged her from him, forgetting that the next moment put an end to her own, &s;he exclaimed, "Wretch, are you going to murder my father?"</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219">
The&s;e pro&s;cribed families &s;eemed to find the &s;weete&s;t &s;ource of con&s;olation in dying together, and to con&s;ider the momentary pa&s;&s;age which they were going to make, as &s;o much the le&s;s painful, &s;ince they &s;hould undergo no &s;eparation, but enter at the &s;ame in|&s;tant into another &s;tate of exi&s;tence. A young lady, the former marchione&s;s of Bois-Berenger, was impri&s;oned in the Luxembourg with her whole family. When her father, mother, and younger &s;i&s;ter received their act of accu&s;ation, and &s;he found her&s;elf alone exempted, &s;he &s;hed a flood of tears, her heart was over|whelmed with angui&s;h. "You will die without me," &s;he cried; "I am con|demned to &s;urvive you; we &s;hall not pe|ri&s;h together!" While &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to de&s;pair, her act of accu&s;ation arrived: a ray of tran&s;port was in&s;tantly diffu&s;ed over her countenance, &s;he flew into the arms of her parents, and em|braced them. "My dear mother," &s;he
<PB N="218" REF="220">
exclaimed, "we &s;hall die together!" When the family was transferred to the Conciergerie, &s;he never left her mother a moment, but watched over her with un|wearied tenderne&s;s; and while &s;he tried to &s;ooth her &s;ufferings by her filial en|dearments, &s;he endeavoured to in&s;pire her with courage by the example of her own heroic fortitude. It was the pic|ture of a &s;ort of Roman charity. The unfortunate mother was mute, and her whole &s;oul &s;eemed petrified with horror. She &s;eemed another Niobe. Her admirable daughter died with the mo&s;t noble re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle Male&s;i, her younger &s;i&s;|ter, when condemned to die, &s;aid to her father with na&iuml;vet&eacute;, "Je me &s;errerai tant contre vous, mon bon pere, vous qui &ecirc;tes &s;i honn&ecirc;te homme, que Dieu me lai&s;&s;era pa&s;&s;er malgr&eacute; mes p&ecirc;ch&eacute;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I will cling &s;o fa&s;t to you, my dear father, you, who are &s;o good, that God will &s;uffer me to pa&s;s in &s;pite of my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions."</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
In the pri&s;on of the Force, the men were allowed to breathe the air in a court|yard &s;eparated by a wall from the habi|tation of the women. A common-&s;ewer was the only means of communication. At that &s;pot, an unhappy &s;on pre&s;ented him&s;elf every morning and every night, to enquire after his mother, who was condemned to die, but reprieved be|cau&s;e &s;he was pregnant, and after her delivery executed. That pious child, in his early age already the victim of mi&s;|fortune, knelt down before the infec|tious &s;ewer, and, with his mouth placed upon the hole, poured forth the feelings of his filial tenderne&s;s. His younger bro|ther, a lovely child of three years of age, and who was &s;uffered to remain with his mother till her la&s;t moments, was often placed at the oppo&s;ite end of the &s;ewer, and an&s;wered for his mother when &s;he was too ill to undertake that ta&s;k her&s;elf. A per&s;on of my acquaintance
<PB N="220" REF="222">
heard him &s;ay, "Mama a moins pleur&eacute; cette nuit&mdash;un peu repo&s;&eacute;e, et te &s;ou|haite le bon jour; c'e&s;t Lolo, qui t'aime bien, qui te dit cela<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Mamma has not cried &s;o much to-night&mdash;She has &s;lept a little, and wi&s;hes you a good morning: it is Lolo who &s;peaks to you, who loves you very much."</NOTE>." At length this unfortunate mother, when going to execu|tion, tran&s;mitted to her &s;on, by the &s;ewer, her long and graceful tre&s;&s;es, as the only inheritance &s;he had to give. She then bade her infant a la&s;t farewell, and was led to the &s;caffold, where her hu&s;|band had peri&s;hed &s;ome months before.</P>
<P>One of the per&s;ons mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by their noble contempt of death was Girey Dupr&eacute;, with whom I was well acquainted. He was the writer of a paper called the Patriote Fran&ccedil;ois, in conjunction with Bri&s;&s;ot: he had acquired a high degree of literary reputation, and maintained his mother, a widow, by the labours of his
<PB N="221" REF="223">
pen. He was twenty-four years of age, and his countenance was one of the mo&s;t agreeable I ever &s;aw. To the&s;e per&s;onal advantages he united the mo&s;t frank and plea&s;ing manners, and di&s;tingui&s;hed pow|ers of conver&s;ation. He had defended the deputies of the Gironde with too much energy not to be involved in their fate, and he was al&s;o connected by the ties of friend&s;hip with Bri&s;&s;ot. Dupr&eacute; was forced to &s;ly from his per&s;ecutors, and &s;eek refuge at Bordeaux, where he was &s;eized and brought back in irons to Paris. Far fr m being depre&s;&s;ed by his approaching fate, the natural gaiety of his di&s;po&s;ition never for&s;ook him a &s;ingle moment. When interrogated at the tri|bunal with re&s;pect to his connection with Bri&s;&s;ot, he an&s;wered only in the&s;e words <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I knew Bri&s;&s;ot; I atte&s;t that he lived like Ari|&s;tides, and died like Sydney the martyr of liberty."</NOTE>, "J'ai connu Bri&s;&s;ot; j'atte&s;te qu'il a v&eacute;cu comme Ari&s;tide, et qu'il e&s;t mort comme

Sydney martyr de la libert&eacute;." He pre|&s;ented him&s;elf at the tribunal with his hair cut off, the collar of his &s;hirt thrown open, and already prepared for the &s;troke of the executioner. On his way to the &s;caffold he &s;aw Robe&s;pierre's mi&s;tre&s;s at the window of his lodging, with her &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ome of their ferocious accomplices, "A bas les tyrans et les dictateurs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Down with tyrants and dictators!"</NOTE>!" cried Dupr&eacute;, repeating this prophetic ex|clamation till he lo&s;t &s;ight of the hou&s;e. While going to execution, he &s;ung in a triumphant tone a very popular patriotic &s;ong which he had him&s;elf compo&s;ed, and of which the chorus was "Plut&ocirc;t la mort que l'e&s;clavage<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Rather death than &s;lavery!"</NOTE>." That cheri&s;hed &s;entiment he fondly repeated even to his la&s;t moment, and death left the half|fini&s;hed &s;entence on his lips.</P>

"The&s;e are a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins," &s;aid he to a fellow pri&s;oner; "I will &s;natch my&s;elf from their rage." He then repeated the&s;e lines of Voltaire,

<L>Les mortels g&eacute;n&eacute;reux di&s;po&s;ent de lour fort:</L></Q>
and after deliberating with his companion upon the mo&s;t effectual manner of &s;trik|ing him&s;elf &s;o that the dagger might reach his heart, he retired to his cell, where he was found a few minutes after breathing his la&s;t &s;igh. Madame Cla|viere, upon receiving the tidings of his death, &s;wallowed poi&s;on, after having em|braced her children, and regulated her af|fairs. Notwith&s;tanding his &s;uicide, the property of Claviere was confi&s;cated, as if he had been regularly condemned. A law had lately been pa&s;&s;ed to con&s;true an act of &s;uicide into a counter-revolution|ary
<PB N="224" REF="226">
project, when the father of a family who knew that his life was devoted, had voluntarily put an end to his exi&s;tence in the hope of pre&s;erving his children from want. Robe&s;pierre and his financial agents found nothing more pre&s;&s;ing than to baffle tho&s;e con&s;piracies again&s;t the re|venues of their government; for confi&s;ca|tion was &s;o evidently the leading motive for the great ma&s;s of their judicial a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nations, that the guillotine, among&s;t other numerous titles, was mo&s;t generally called the "mini&s;ter of finance." The tribunal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> began, to u&s;e the language of the orator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Sheridan's eloquent &s;peech on Mr. Ha&s;tings's trial.</NOTE>, "to look into their ca&s;h account for delinquency, and found the offenders guilty of &s;o many hundred thou&s;and pounds worth of trea&s;on.

<P>On &s;ome occa&s;ions the genuine feelings of nature bur&s;t forth amid&s;t the &s;tupefied terror that had frozen every heart. A law had lately pa&s;&s;ed, obliging every mer|chant to in&s;cribe on his door the &s;tock of merchandize in his warehou&s;e, under the penalty of death. A wine-merchant, who&s;e affairs had called him ha&s;tily into the country, entru&s;ted the bu&s;ine&s;s of the in&s;cription to his &s;on, who from igno|rance or regligence, for it was clearly prov|ed that there exi&s;ted no intention of fraud, had omitted to affix the declaration in the preci&s;e words of the law. The con&s;cien|tious jury of the revolutionary tribunal condemned him to death, pre&s;uming on the counter-revolutionary intention in this ca&s;e from the act, though they were in general accu&s;tomed, for want of other evidence, to find the act by gue&s;&s;ing at the intention. The innocent pri&s;oner had prepared him&s;elf for death, when the mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="226" REF="228">
of ju&s;tice, informed of the ca&s;e, wrote to the convention, demanding a re&s;pite. His letter had not been half read before the hall re&s;ounded with the cry of "reprieve, reprieve!" and fearing that the act of pardon would arrive too late, the convention, di&s;pen&s;ing with the u&s;ual formalities, not only &s;ent its officers and part of the military force, but great numbers of the deputies ru&s;hed out to &s;top the execution. The officer who re|ceived the order fir&s;t, with which he flew towards the place of the revolution, told me that on his coming out of the con|vention he &s;aw the &s;caffold reared and the crowd a&s;&s;embled. He had &s;carcely reached the fir&s;t tree of the vi&s;ta when he &s;aw the fatal knife de&s;cend; he redoubled his &s;peed, but before he got to the end of the walk another head had fallen: a third per&s;on had mounted the &s;caffold, but the voice of the me&s;&s;enger was too weak, from the efforts he had made to reach the &s;pot,
<PB N="227" REF="229">
to be noticed by the multitude. The fourth had a&s;cended when he gained the place, ru&s;hed through the crowd, called to the executioner, and leaped on the &s;caf|fold. The pri&s;oner had been &s;tripped, his &s;houlders were bare, and he was already tied to the plank; when the cry of "re|prieve" bur&s;t forth. The officer enquired his name, which the young man told him. "Alas! you are not the per&s;on," he re|plied. The pri&s;oner &s;ubmitted calmly to his fate.</P>
<P>The bearer of the reprieve, who is a per&s;on of a very benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, declared that he never felt &s;o acute a pang as when he was compelled to turn away from this unfortunate victim. He ha&s;t|ened, however, to the pri&s;on, where he found the per&s;on who was reprieved await|ing the return of the cart and the execu|tioner, his hair cut and his hands tied, to be led to death at another part of the city where his hou&s;e &s;tood. A wife and nine

<P>That cla&s;s of men who were peculiarly the object of the tyrant's rage were men of letters, with re&s;pect to whom the jealou&s;y of the rival mingled with the fury of the oppre&s;&s;or, and again&s;t whom his hatred was le&s;s implacable for having oppo&s;ed his tyranny, than for having eclip&s;ed his eloquence. It is a curious con&s;ideration, that the unexampled crimes of this &s;an|guinary u&s;urper, and the con&s;equent mi&s;e|ries which have de&s;olated the fine&s;t coun|try of Europe, may perhaps, if traced to their &s;ource, be found to ari&s;e from the re&s;entment of a di&s;appointed wit. Ro|be&s;pierre, for the misfortune of humani|ty,
<PB N="229" REF="231" MS="y">
was per&s;ecuted by the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s de+&s;ire of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf as an orator, and nature had denied him the power. He and his brother were born at Arras, and left orphans at an early age. The bi|&s;hop of Arras had be&s;towed on them the ad|vantages of a liberal education. Robe&s;pierre di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his application to his fir&s;t &s;tudies, and obtained many literary prizes. At the age of &s;ixteen, elated by the applau&s;e he had received, he fan|cied him&s;elf endowed with &s;uch rare power of genius as would enable him to act a &s;plendid part on the theatre of the world, and his friends indulged the &s;ame fond expectation. He applied to the &s;tudy of the law, and already in imagination con|templated him&s;elf di&s;puting with the fir&s;t orators of the age the palm of eloquence. Experience, however, convinced his friends, and at length him&s;elf, that they had indulged a vain illu&s;ion. He di&s;|covered no ta&s;te or aptitude for the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="230" REF="232" MS="y">
for which he was de&s;igned, became weary of &s;tudy, was checked by the &s;lighte&s;t difficulties; and being found de|&s;titute of tho&s;e talents which were nece&s;|&s;ary to his &s;ucce&s;s as a public &s;peaker, his benefactor, after a trial of &s;ufficient length, refu&s;ed to &s;upport him any longer at a con&s;iderable and fruitle&s;s expence at Paris, but ordered him to return to Arras, where in an humble &s;phere, better &s;uited to the mediocrity of his abilities, he might pur&s;ue his profe&s;&s;ion as a lawyer. Robe&s;pierre was compelled to return to Arras; which, after the &s;plendid dreams he had indulged of fame and honours in the capital, was an humiliation he felt keenly, but which he brooded over in &s;ilence: for he never on any occa|&s;ion di&s;played his &s;en&s;ibility to mortifica|tions, which was in proportion to his ex+ce&s;&s;ive vanity, but concentred within his vindictive &s;oul his di&s;grace, his re&s;ent|ment, and his projects of vengeance. From
<PB N="231" REF="233" MS="y">
the period of his return to Arras may be dated his abhorrence of men of talents. From that moment, in&s;tead of admiring genius, he repined at its exi&s;tence. The &s;ame feelings clung to his ba&s;e and envi|ous &s;pirit when he had u&s;urped his dic|tatorial power. He made it pain of death to be the author of what he called &s;editious publications, by which means it was ea&s;y for him to involve men of letters in a general pro&s;cription. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every dramatic piece in which there were any allu&s;ions he di&s;liked, or wherein the picture or hi&s;tory held up to view any feature of his own character. And it was his plan to aboli&s;h theatrical entertain|ments altogether; for he con&s;idered the applau&s;e be&s;towed on fine poetry as &s;ome|thing of which his harangues were de|frauded. He held up men of letters to the people as per&s;ons ho&s;tile to the cau&s;e of liberty, and incapable of rai&s;ing them|&s;elves to the height of the revolution; and to make them &s;till greater objects of mi&s;|tru&s;t

<P>One of the objects of Robe&s;pierre's re|&s;entment was M. Bitauby, a Pru&s;&s;ian, well known in the literary world by his ele|gant tran&s;lation of Homer into French. He was a member of the academy at Ber|lin, from which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia or|dered his name to be &s;truck out, and the pen&s;ion with which the great Frederic had rewarded his merit to be di&s;conti|nued,
<PB N="235" REF="237">
on account of his avowed attach|ment to the principles of the revolution. M. Bitauby had fixed his re&s;idence at Paris &s;everal years previous to that event. I have been acquainted with him and his lady &s;ince my fir&s;t arrival in France, and have never met with per&s;ons who blend|ed with the wi&s;dom and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of age, &s;o much of all that is amiable in youth. M. Bitauby, in the fir&s;t days of the revolution, had been per&s;onally ac|quainted with Robe&s;pierre, who fre|quently dined at his hou&s;e; but he was not long in di&s;covering the &s;anguinary and fanatical ideas of liberty which filled the &s;oul of the tyrant, and which &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted him that he gave up his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre did not forget the affront, which he had now the power to avenge. M. Bitauby and his wife were dragged to pri&s;on in the beginning of the winter, where they langui&s;hed ten months; and depriv|ed
<PB N="236" REF="238">
of tho&s;e cares which their age and their infirmities required, they had almo&s;t &s;unk beneath their weight. Madame Bitauby's indi&s;po&s;itions required medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;o many formalities were nece&s;&s;ary before a phy&s;ician could be admitted into the pri&s;on, that, if the di&s;order was not of a lingering nature, the patient ex|pired while the police were arranging the ceremonials previous to his relief. Dur|ing the la&s;t months of Robe&s;pierre's u&s;ur|pation, the pri&s;oners were refu&s;ed the con|&s;olation of being attended by their own phy&s;icians. Profe&s;&s;ional men were ap|pointed by the police; and as &s;elections were made among tho&s;e who were able to give clearer proofs of their Jacobin principles than of their medical &s;kill, the&s;e revolutionary doctors &s;ometimes robbed the revolutionary jury of their prey. A few however of the&s;e "officers of health" po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the negative merit which Dr. Franklin a&s;cribed to old and
<PB N="237" REF="239">
experienced phy&s;icians, "<HI>they let</HI> their patients die," for the remedies they ad|mini&s;tered were of too harmle&s;s a nature to be capable of doing mi&s;chief. The phy&s;ician of the Conciergerie had as &s;trong a predilection for ti&s;anne as Dr. Sangrado for hot water. Ti&s;anne was the vivifying draught which was de&s;tined to &s;ooth all pains, and heal all maladies. One day the doctor, after having felt a patient's pul&s;e, &s;aid to the jailor, "He is better this morning." "Yes," an&s;wer|ed the jailor, "<HI>he</HI> is better, but the per|&s;on who lay in this bed ye&s;terday is dead." "Eh bien," re&s;umed the doctor coolly, qu'on donne toujours la ti&s;anne."</P>
<P>M. and Madame Bitauby had an advo|cate in their di&s;tre&s;s whom it was difficult indeed to re&s;i&s;t. This was an old &s;ervant of eighty years of age. His figure was &s;o intere&s;ting that Sterne's pencil only could &s;ketch it well; and had Sterne &s;een him, he would not have failed to draw
<PB N="238" REF="240">
his portrait. He pleaded the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter with &s;uch pathetic eloquence, that at the revolutionary committee he &s;ometimes "drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek." But the old man was eloquent in vain, and was &s;inking with de&s;pair into the grave when the revolution of the 9th of Thermidor re&s;tored his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to liberty.</P>
<P>The fate of Boucheu, author of a poem called "The Months," excited particular &s;ympathy. He pa&s;&s;ed his time in pri&s;on, in educating one of his children, and this employment &s;eem|ed to charm away his cares. The day he received his act of accu&s;ation, know|ing well the fate that awaited him, he &s;ent his &s;on home, giving him his por|trait, which a painter who was his fellow|pri&s;oner had drawn, and which he or|dered the child to give his mother. Be|low the picture he had written the follow|ing lines:<Q><PB N="239" REF="241">

<P>La Voi&s;ier, the celebrated chemi&s;t, was put to death with the other farmers ge|neral. He reque&s;ted a fortnight's re&s;|pite to enable him to complete a phi|lo&s;ophical experiment. The Vandals had no time to pau&s;e in their career of blood, for the pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophy, and &s;ent him away, ob&s;erving that the republic had no longer any need of che|mi&s;ts.

&s;ight by a voluntary death. La Harpe was thrown into pri&s;on, and was de&s;tined to peri&s;h on the &s;caffold. The author of the Travels of the younger Anachar|&s;is, notwith&s;tanding his advanced age, was the object of continual per&s;ecution. Flo|rian, who was him&s;elf impri&s;oned, and con|demned to &s;ee his deare&s;t friends peri&s;h, had not &s;ufficient fortitude to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch trials. His charming pen had di&s;|played the mo&s;t &s;oothing images of hap|pine&s;s and virtue; and when he beheld around him only mi&s;ery and crimes, his di&s;ordered imagination ha&s;tened his death. Vicq d'Azyr died of a broken heart. Bailly, the fir&s;t mayor of Paris, who&s;e a&s;tronomical re&s;earches have placed him in the highe&s;t rank of &s;cience, was mur|dered with circum&s;tances of particular aggravation. He was to have been ex|ecuted in the Champ de Mars; but from the caprice of the &s;anguinary mob, he was compelled to wait two or three hours
<PB N="241" REF="243">
at the place of execution, while the &s;caffold was removed to a field adjoin|ing, where he &s;tood drenched in rain, in the mid&s;t of winter, and, which was more difficult to bear than the "pelting of the pitile&s;s &s;torm," expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and injuries of an execrable &s;et of wretches who u&s;ually attended the&s;e horrid &s;pectacles. The red flag was burned before his eyes, and he was compelled to &s;et fire to the pile that con&s;umed it, while the ruffians plunged his head into the &s;moke for their farther amu&s;ement. He &s;ubmitted to all that was inflicted on him with the &s;erenity of a philo&s;opher, and only reque&s;ted with mildne&s;s, that his &s;ufferings might be terminated.

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the particular objects of Ro|be&s;pierre's rage was general Miranda, a native of Peru, well known in Europe by that philanthropic &s;pirit of adventure which led him to pa&s;s many years in travelling through various parts of the globe, with the view of being u&s;eful to his own country; which, &s;ince the pe|riod of the &s;anguinary Spani&s;h conque&s;ts, has groaned beneath the yoke of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. If this philo&s;ophi|cal enthu&s;ia&s;t &s;hould not accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e for which he undertook his cru|&s;ade of patrioti&s;m, it has at lea&s;t enabled him to furni&s;h his mind with &s;uch acqui|&s;itions of knowledge, &s;uch &s;tores of ob|&s;ervation, and &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed ta&s;te for the fine arts, as render his &s;ociety in
<PB N="244" REF="246">
the highe&s;t degree in&s;tructive and delight|ful; while with an under&s;tanding of the fir&s;t order he unites that perfect &s;impli|city of manners which u&s;ually belongs to great minds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dumourier, in his Memoirs, while he does ju&s;|tice to Miranda's talents, complains of his "<HI>haughti|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>hardne&s;s</HI> of character." Miranda has cer|tainly more of the &s;edate dignity of a Spaniard, than the bri&s;k air of a Frenchman; and if that ele|vation of &s;oul which &s;corns to make any compo&s;ition with principles be <HI>haughtine&s;s,</HI> and that inflexibi|lity which &s;tedfa&s;tly pur&s;ues the &s;traight path of integrity and honour be <HI>hardne&s;s of character,</HI> Dumourier is in the right.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Pru&s;&s;ians were on their march towards Paris, Miranda accepted a command in the army of Dumourier, who was then retreating before them. After the defeat of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and on the entrance of the republican army into the Low Countries, Miranda added to the high reputation he had already acquired through Europe, by the gallant
<PB N="245" REF="247">
manner in which he executed that part of the conque&s;t of tho&s;e countries which was allotted him. When Dumourier came to Paris, the command of the whole army devolved on Miranda; and when the campaign began, and Dumourier was invading Holland, the attack of Mae&s;|tricht, and the army on the Meu&s;e, were committed to his care. The &s;ucce&s;sful march of the Au&s;trians on Aix-la-Cha|pelle obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and he was joined &s;oon after by Dumourier, who had left his conque&s;t in Holland to repair the misfortunes of the army com|manded by Valence. The ill humour which Dumourier had brought with him from Paris, where the Jacobins had al|ready begun their &s;y&s;tem of mi&s;rule and anarchy, was not le&s;&s;ened by ill &s;ucce&s;s; and goaded by the pang of indignation and of di&s;appointed ambition, he formed the criminal de&s;ign of betraying the re|public. This &s;pirit of rebellion found
<PB N="246" REF="248">
the mo&s;t inflexible oppo&s;ition from Mi|randa, who&s;e per&s;onal friend&s;hip for Du|mourier did not lead him to forget that his fir&s;t duty was towards that country which had entru&s;ted him with its defence. The event of the battle of Nerwinden, fought again&s;t the repeated advice of Miranda, and in which this general lo&s;t a con&s;iderable part of the troops he com|manded, having been forced to &s;u&s;tain the whole &s;hock of the enemy, afforded Dumourier the means of getting rid of an opponent &s;o ho&s;tile to his de&s;igns; and Miranda was &s;ent by the commi&s;|&s;aries La Croix and Danton, without be|ing previou&s;ly heard by them, to give an account of his conduct at the bar of the convention. He underwent the mo&s;t &s;trict xamination before the committees of war and general &s;afety, who declared, that not the &s;lighte&s;t doubt remained of his military conduct, or his fidelity to the republic. But this report was &s;tifled by
<PB N="247" REF="249">
the intrigues of La Croix, Danton, and others of their party; and he was &s;ent, in defiance of all decency, to the revo|lutionary tribunal.</P>
<P>His trial took place in the beginning of May, before ju&s;tice had for ever fled from that &s;anguinary court. The hour of carnage was not yet arrived: the tri|bunal, though from its in&s;titution terrible, and cruel in its forms, which placed the life of the accu&s;ed upon a ca&s;ting voice, had not yet become a &s;hrine con&s;ecrated to infernal deities, and reeking with the daily &s;acrifice of human victims. The voice of innocence was not yet &s;tifled by the &s;avage vociferations of mon&s;ters thir&s;ting for its blood; and Miranda pleaded his cau&s;e with &s;uch &s;ublime energy, as proved that his powers as an orator were not inferior to his talents as a general. He covered him&s;elf with glory, and his enemies with confu&s;ion; and over&s;tepping the u&s;ual forms, the
<PB N="248" REF="250">
jury made their verdict the vehicle of eulogium upon his conduct.</P>
<P>After his trial he retired to a &s;mall di&s;tance from Paris, where he lived in literary lei&s;ure, amid&s;t his books and paintings, and where I vi&s;ited him fre|quently. His repo&s;e was however of &s;hort duration. He was too di&s;tingui&s;hed a character to e&s;cape the tyranny which the con&s;piracy of the 31&s;t of May had e&s;tabli&s;hed; and after having been per&s;e|cuted by domiciliary vi&s;its on various pretences, he was again thrown into pri|&s;on, charged with being the chief de|fender and abettor of the Gironde and Girondi&s;m. The real cau&s;e of Robe&s;|pierre's animo&s;ity towards him is not well known, but may be re&s;olved into that general hatred which he bore to|wards all men of talents; and as he knew that the eminent abilities of Miranda were improved by advantages which had fallen to the lot of few, he might na|turally
<PB N="249" REF="251">
think that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a man was dangerous to his own.</P>
<P>Twice, in the zenith of his tyranny, he accu&s;ed Miranda to his &s;ubjects the Jacobins; and when we heard that the name of Miranda had i&s;&s;ued from tho&s;e pe&s;tilential lips, we con&s;idered his mur|der as inevitable. One ob&s;tacle was found &s;ufficient to &s;hield him from the tyrant's vengeance; and this was a feel|ing of &s;hame which lurked in the mind of the public accu&s;er, who, covered as he was with blood, did not dare to meet the look of Miranda, and bring forward a &s;econd accu&s;ation, after having once joined the general voice of applau&s;e up|on his acquittal. This &s;entiment led Fouquier Tainville to put off the &s;econd trial required by Robe&s;pierre, till the tyrant would hear of delay and ex|cu&s;es no more; and him&s;elf in&s;cribed Miranda's name on the fatal li&s;t for the twelfth of Thermidor. The revo|lution
<PB N="250" REF="252">
of the tenth re&s;tored him to li|berty.</P>
<P>Miranda &s;ubmitted to an impri&s;on|ment of eighteen months, under the con|tinual expectation of death, with that philo&s;ophical &s;trength of mind which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a mo&s;t eminent degree. He had indeed determined not to be dragged to the guillotine, and had therefore pro|vided him&s;elf with poi&s;on. Thus armed, he &s;ent for a con&s;iderable number of books from his library, and placed them in his little chamber, of which he found means to keep the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Here he told me, that he endeavoured to for|get his pre&s;ent &s;ituation in the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory and &s;cience. He tried to con&s;i|der him&s;elf as a pa&s;&s;enger on a long voy|age, who had to fill up the vacuity of time with the re&s;earches of knowledge, and was alike prepared to peri&s;h or to reach the &s;hore. During his long con|finement, the only per&s;on with whom
<PB N="251" REF="253">
he a&s;&s;ociated was the former marquis Achille du Chatelet, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the accompli&s;hments of literature, and whom the tyrants had dragged to pri&s;on while the wounds were yet unhealed which he had received in defending his country. He and Miranda u&s;ed to meet every evening, take their tea together, and talk over the books they had read during the day, avoiding as much as po&s;&s;ible the &s;ubject of politics, which affected them too deeply, nor could Du Chatelet bear to pronounce the names of the decemvirs. Tidings, however, of the horrible &s;cenes which were pa&s;&s;ing in Paris reached him in the gloom of his pri&s;on; and the emotions of his mind, together with the irritation of his wound, produced a fever. Miranda attended him night and day alternately with an|other pri&s;oner; and he was recovering from this di&s;order, when he heard that &s;ome of his deare&s;t friends had peri&s;hed
<PB N="252" REF="254">
on the &s;caffold. The next morning, when Miranda went to his room to re|lieve a fellow-pri&s;oner who had watched him during the night, he ob&s;erved that his whole face was violently inflamed. He enquired eagerly what was the mat|ter. Du Chatelet pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and bade him farewell. This unfortunate young man, unable to &s;upport the &s;hock occa&s;ioned by the murder of his friends, and grown weary of exi&s;tence, re&s;olved not to wait till the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins called him to the &s;caffold, but had recour&s;e to poi|&s;on, with which he had provided him|&s;elf. A phy&s;ician had furni&s;hed Verg|niaud, Du Chatelet, and &s;everal other martyrs to their country, with this le|thean remedy, which they called <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pill of liberty.</NOTE> la pillule de la libert&eacute;. A note was found in Du Chatelet's chamber, in which he declared that he had &s;old his books and all that belonged to him in the pri&s;on,
<PB N="253" REF="255">
to Miranda. This was the only mode in which he could leave his effects to his friend, or prevent their being &s;eized by the nation.</P>
<P>Miranda found a memorial among his papers, which he has put into my hands, where he traces the hi&s;tory of his poli|tical life. It contains an honourable li&s;t of the &s;acrifices he had made, the labours he had achieved, and the perils he had encountered in the public cau&s;e, from the period when in 1789 he contributed in the baillage of Perronne to the union of the nobles with the third e&s;tate, till the middle of the year 1793; when, al|though his wounds were not clo&s;ed, he de&s;ired leave to return to the army, and obtained the command of the di&s;trict of Aire. But he &s;oon found that his in|firmities did not permit him to fulfil the duties of his &s;tation:&mdash;he was obliged to return; and though his fortune was now lo&s;t, he refu&s;ed to accept his pay as a
<PB N="254" REF="256">
general officer, &s;ince he was no longer able to &s;erve his country. At the very moment when he was preparing to return home, he was arre&s;ted by the revolu|tionary committee at Aire, as a mea&s;ure of "<HI>general &s;afety,</HI>" and conducted with guards to the committee of general &s;afety of the convention, who, with the &s;ame tender regard for public &s;ecurity, in&s;tead of declaring that this gallant young of|ficer had merited well of his country, &s;ent him to the pri&s;on of the Force, and refu&s;ed to let his &s;ervant enter for a few minutes in the day to dre&s;s his wound. His pri&s;on &s;ix months after be|came his grave, and he was placed be|yond the reach of tyranny. Miranda was then left to ab&s;olute &s;olitude; but he had &s;till the courage to live, and at length the hour of deliverance arrived.</P>
<P>You will perhaps think, dear &s;ir, that the &s;ketch which I have given you of public and private calamity is &s;ufficiently
<PB N="255" REF="257">
gloomy. But, alas! the &s;cene blackens as we advance, and wears a deeper hor|ror. We have now arrived at that pe|riod when the tyrant, grown bolder by &s;ucce&s;s, intoxicated with power, and throwing a&s;ide all regard even to forms, reached the climax of his crimes, and accelerated the moment of his fall. You will view him and the agents of his ini|quity no longer &s;atisfied with victims in detail: they now murder in <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> and, in the words of Racine,
<Q><L>Lavent dans le fang leurs bras en&s;anglant&eacute;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall in the cour&s;e of a fortnight &s;end you a hi&s;tory of the la&s;t &s;cenes of this foul tragedy, and give you &s;uch a detail, as can only be learnt on the &s;pot, of the events which produced the revolu|tion of the 9th of Thermidor, and of the incidents which on that memorable night determined the fate of the French republic.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="258">
In the mean time, you will not ex|claim as the Roman poet did with re|&s;pect to religion, "Of &s;o many evils could Liberty have been the cau&s;e!" It is, alas! the condition of our unin&s;tructed nature, that nations like individuals &s;hould acquire wi&s;dom only in the &s;chool of ex|perience; and though the page of hi&s;tory, which according to Lord Bolingbroke is "philo&s;ophy teaching by example," be open before us, we are too pre&s;umptuous, or too carele&s;s, to heed or apply the le&s;|&s;on. I need not make u&s;e of any rea&s;on|ing to convince you that Liberty is inno|cent of the outrages committed under its borrowed &s;anction; for though we might from &s;ome momentary impul&s;e bla&s;pheme its name, as Lucretius did that of religion, we mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that neither religion nor liberty is chargeable with the crimes committed by tyranny or &s;uper&s;tition. As no weeds are more pernicious than tho&s;e which ari&s;e in that &s;oil from which good
<PB N="257" REF="259">
fruit alone &s;hould have &s;prung, &s;o no crimes have exceeded tho&s;e which the ty|rant and the fanatic have committed in the name of Freedom, the guardian an|gel of the happine&s;s of mankind, and in that of the Being "who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude without inform|ing you, that the dark picture which you have been contemplating is relieved by a bright and &s;oothing per&s;pective. The pa&s;t &s;eems like one of tho&s;e frightful dreams which pre&s;ents to the di&s;turbed &s;pirit phantoms of unde&s;cribable horror, and "deeds without a name;" awakened from which, we hail with rapture the cheering beams of the morning, and an|ticipate the meridian lu&s;tre of the day. The 9th of Thermidor has e&s;tabli&s;hed the republic; and nothing now remains but to arrange its forms. Its internal &s;itua|tion will no more offer a hideous con|tra&s;t to its external victories. The guil|ty
<PB N="258" REF="260">
commune of Paris exi&s;ts no longer; the den of the Jacobins is clo&s;ed; and the whole nation, rou&s;ed into a &s;en&s;e of its danger by the terrible le&s;&s;on it has been taught, can be oppre&s;&s;ed no more. There &s;carcely exi&s;ts a family, or an in|dividual in France, that has not been be|reaved by tyranny of &s;ome dear relation, &s;ome cho&s;en friend, who &s;eems from the grave to call upon them with a warning voice to watch over the liberties of their country. The love of public virtue in the people of France is now blended with all the &s;ympathies and affections of their natures: it is heard in the &s;ighs of general mourning; it &s;peaks in the tears of the widow and the orphan; and is not only imprinted by every argument that can render it &s;acred and durable on the under&s;tanding, but clings to every feeling of the heart.</P>

<P>THE repre&s;entatives of the French people under&s;igned, con&s;idering that, amid&s;t events which excite the indig|nation of the whole republic, they can|not remain &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the at|tempts committed again&s;t the national repre&s;entation, without feeling them&s;elves chargeable with the mo&s;t &s;hameful pu&s;il|lanimity, or with becoming &s;till more guilty &s;harers in the crime:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the &s;ame con&s;pira|tors, who, from the very period in which the republic was proclaimed, had never di&s;continued their attacks on the national repre&s;entation, have at length filled up
<PB N="260" REF="262">
the mea&s;ure of their crimes, in violating the maje&s;ty of the people in the per&s;ons of their repre&s;entatives, by driving &s;ome to &s;eek their &s;afety in &s;light, by impri&s;oning others, and forcing the re&s;t to bend their necks under the yoke of the mo&s;t in&s;ult|ing tyranny:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the heads of this fac|tion, emboldened by long impunity, growing &s;trong through exce&s;s of impu|dence, and relying on the number of their accomplices, have &s;eized on all the branches of the executive government, on the trea&s;ury, on the means of defence and the re&s;ources of the nation, which they di&s;po&s;e of at their plea&s;ure, and which they are employing to effect its ruin:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that they have at their command the chiefs of the military force, and the con&s;tituted authorities of Paris; that the majority of the inhabi|tants of this city, intimidated by the ex|ce&s;&s;es of a faction which the law is un|able
<PB N="261" REF="263">
to reach, affrighted by pro&s;crip|tions with which they are continually threatened, find them&s;elves not only incapable of de&s;troying the machinations of the con&s;pirators, but often, through re&s;pect to the law, which enjoins obedi|ence to the con&s;tituted authorities, com|pelled even to become as it were accom|plices in their crimes:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that &s;o great is the oppre&s;|&s;ion under which the national convention labours, that not one of its decrees can be executed, unle&s;s it be approved or dic|tated by the heads of this faction; that the con&s;pirators have in fact &s;et them|&s;elves up as the only organ of the public will, and that they have reduced the re&s;t of the national repre&s;entation to be the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of their plea&s;ure:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the national conven|tion, after having been forced to inve&s;t with unlimited powers tho&s;e commi&s;&s;aries who have been &s;ent into the departments
<PB N="262" REF="264">
and to the armies, and who have been cho&s;en exclu&s;ively by this faction, has been unable to check the arbitrary acts which they have committed, or even to prote&s;t again&s;t the incendiary and di&s;or|ganizing principles which the majority among&s;t them have propagated:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that not only has the na|tional convention been rendered incapable of pro&s;ecuting the de&s;poilers of the public wealth, or the wretches who have given orders for murder and pillage; but even the&s;e &s;ame con&s;pirators, after having fail|ed in their de&s;igns on the night of the 10th and the 11th of March, have ac|compli&s;hed them with more &s;ucce&s;s on the 20th, 21&s;t, 27th, and 31&s;t of May, and on the 2d of June la&s;t pa&s;t:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that at this la&s;t epocha they beat to arms, rung the toc&s;in, and fired the alarm guns; that the barriers of the city were &s;hut, all communication cut off, the &s;ecrecy of letters violated, the
<PB N="263" REF="265">
hall of the convention blockaded by an armed force of more than 60,000 men; that a formidable artillery was &s;tationed at every avenue of the national palace; that furnaces were fixed to &s;erve the guns with red hot balls, and that every preparation was made for an attack; that the battalions enrolled for the Vend&eacute;e, but detained for this purpo&s;e in the neigh|bourhood of Paris, were among&s;t the number of the be&s;iegers; that ruffians in the pay of the con&s;pirators, and fitted for the execution of their bloody pro|jects, occupied the mo&s;t important po&s;ts and the pa&s;&s;ages of the hall; that they were openly rewarded for their zeal by di&s;tributions of provi&s;ions and money; that at the moment when the national convention pre&s;ented it&s;elf in full a&s;&s;em|bly at the avenue of the national palace to enjoin the military to withdraw, the commander, inve&s;ted by the con&s;pirators with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute dictator&s;hip, had

audacity to in&s;i&s;t that the pro&s;cribed de|puties &s;hould be delivered up to the ven|geance of the people; and that on the re|fu&s;al of the convention he had the im|pudence to call to arms, and put in dan|ger the lives of the repre&s;entatives of the French people:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering, finally, that it is by ma|chinations &s;uch as the&s;e that they have forced from the convention, or rather from a &s;ixth part of the members who com|po&s;e it, a decree which pronounced the arbitrary &s;eizure and deprived of their functions, without accu&s;ation, without evidence, in contempt of all forms, and through the mo&s;t criminal violation of the rights of man and the national &s;ove|reignty, thirty-two repre&s;entatives marked out and pro&s;cribed by the con&s;pirators them&s;elves:</P>

<P>REPUBLICANS, you are acquainted with the dangers which threaten the pub|lic weal. They are &s;o great that we mu&s;t either take arms and die in the field of honour, or &s;ubmit to the &s;troke of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in our homes. We mu&s;t &s;ave the republic, or peri&s;h with it: we mu&s;t crouch to anarchy, or de&s;troy it. We mu&s;t re&s;ume our rank among the nations, or yield the precedence to the &s;lave of the A&s;iatic de&s;pot, or the uncivilized Tartarian horde.</P>
<P>When the national repre&s;entation, by lo&s;ing its unity, becomes virtually di&s;|&s;olved; when the departments, who&s;e deputies are &s;hamefully arre&s;ted, con&s;ider them&s;elves in reality as no longer repre|&s;ented; when the maje&s;ty of the people is violated by the attempts committed again&s;t its mandatories; when the faction which is longing for the return of royalty in|&s;olently
<PB N="267" REF="269">
domineers over that corrupted city by which we are menaced, there is no longer any room for he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Shame and &s;lavery, or let us fly to Pa|ris! You wa&s;te the precious moments which are yet left to apply the remedy, in deliberating on the di&s;ea&s;e. Your country, your liberties, your honour as Frenchmen, your&s;elves, your wives, and children, are lo&s;t. Neither public nor private fortunes any longer exi&s;t: you lo&s;e four year of toil, of care, of labour, of watchings, of battles, and torrents of blood &s;hed in defence of the mo&s;t glo|rious of cau&s;es. The&s;e will be inevita|bly lo&s;t, and it is but a vile handful of factious traitors who are deciding on the liberty of twenty-five millions of men.</P>
<P>In this critical and de&s;perate &s;ituation one general voice is heard from the cen|tre to the confines of the republic. It proclaims that the nation is rou&s;ed, to conquer or die. The nation is rou&s;ed;
<PB N="268" REF="270">
let us march! Mar&s;eilles calls on you; Mar&s;eilles which has unque&s;tionably &s;o much right to your confidence, and &s;o deep a concern in the &s;upport of this re|volution, of which &s;he has given &s;o noble an example. This appeal is the la&s;t u&s;e which &s;he wi&s;hes to make of the liberty of &s;peech in order to promulgate the great re&s;olutions &s;he has adopted, and the deci&s;ive mea&s;ures &s;he has taken. Far from a warlike people, far from a nation of &s;oldiers, who wait only the &s;ignal for battle, be the vain tin&s;el of words! To dare, and to act, is all we have to do.</P>
<P>Let us &s;trike; and let Frenchmen, &s;o long characteri&s;ed as frivolous, &s;hew the world, that if they de&s;erved the imputa|tion while under the controul of kings, they have now re&s;umed their antient ha|bitudes, and are become independent and formidable like the Gauls and the Franks, from whom they glory in being de&s;cended.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="271">
Republicans, who pant for liberty and dete&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s, who abhor royalty, and de&s;ire the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the re|public united and undivided, league your|&s;elves with the Mar&s;eillois, who breathe the &s;ame vows already made by a con&s;i|derable number of departments. They declare that the pre&s;ent political &s;tate of Paris is equivalent to a declaration of civil war again&s;t the whole republic.</P>
<P>They accu&s;e, and pre&s;ent to you as guilty of all the di&s;orders that afflict France, Philip d'Orleans and his fac|tion; the frantic mon&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marat.</NOTE> who&s;e ve|nal howlings are his purcha&s;e, and who&s;e name would &s;ully this declaration; the den of the Jacobins of Paris; the &s;edi|tious and factious men who are &s;preading them&s;elves throughout the republic, and exciting it to commotion. Mar&s;eilles points them out as common enemies,
<PB N="270" REF="272">
who have been wi&s;hing to lead us to the brink of the precipice, to adulterate their mon&s;trous but mea&s;ured &s;y&s;tem of anar|chy with a king of their own creating: and this king would have been the mo&s;t di&s;honoured being in exi&s;tence; a man overwhelmed with debt, rich in di&s;grace, debauchery, and ba&s;ene&s;s; a man whom no virtuous citizen would admit among his &s;ervants, and who would be driven by them&s;elves from their &s;ociety; a man, in &s;hort, who is impri&s;oned within our walls, and of who&s;e &s;peedy and &s;evere puni&s;hment we are equally de&s;irous.</P>
<P>We invite you to &s;ign with us this ju&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;able covenant which we pro|po&s;e for the public &s;afety, and to wipe off the &s;tain of &s;o many injuries.</P>
<P>Mar&s;eilles, therefore, declares, that it is in a legal &s;tate of re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;|&s;ion, and that it is authori&s;ed by the law to make war again&s;t the &s;editious:</P>
<P N="2">2. That it can no longer acknowledge
<PB N="271" REF="273">
a convention who&s;e unity is violated, to be the national repre&s;entation; and that at that period only, when the deputies of the people &s;hall be fully and freely rein&s;tated in their functions, the nation will obey its orders with confidence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P N="3">3. That the throne of anarchy has been rai&s;ed on the wrecks of the throne you have overturned, and that tyranny is dete&s;table in proportion to the corrup|tion of tho&s;e who are prompted to exer|ci&s;e it:</P>
<P N="4">4. That the con&s;pirators have already proceeded to di&s;&s;olve the national con|vention by reducing and di&s;organizing it, and exciting it to acts of folly, ra&s;hne&s;s, and di&s;order; and that the French nation can con&s;ider tho&s;e acts which are pro|mulgated by a portion of its repre&s;enta|tives who yet keep their &s;eats, only as evidences of the tyranny exerci&s;ed over
<PB N="272" REF="274">
&s;ome by the perfidy and wickedne&s;s of others:</P>
<P N="5">5. That the impri&s;onment of a great number of deputies of the convention is an attempt made in the delirium of guilt, an act which po&s;terity will &s;carcely be|lieve, if its authenticity were not proved by the record of the ju&s;t vengeance we have &s;worn to take, and which you will aid us in inflicting:</P>
<P N="6">6. That the good citizens who &s;till inhabit Paris are invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as much as lies in their power, the united efforts which we are going to make for the pub|lic welfare, and to let the whole weight of the re&s;pon&s;ibility re&s;t on the heads of the con&s;pirators, which we declare are forfeited by their crimes:</P>
<P N="7">7. That the domineering faction at Paris has compelled the departments to lead into that city, &s;o long the prey and &s;port of ambitious men, the military force which is the la&s;t re&s;ource of the &s;o|vereign
<PB N="273" REF="275">
people; declaring at the &s;ame time that the united force under the di|rection of the departments, and in con|formity to their wi&s;hes, is de&s;tined to ex|tirpate tho&s;e who&s;e criminal hands have been employed in effecting the ruin of their country:</P>
<P N="8">8. That every man capable of bearing arms is &s;ummoned, in the name of the law, in that of his own and the public intere&s;t, and in the name of humanity, to join his efforts in &s;trengthening the dyke which we are oppo&s;ing to this de|&s;olating torrent; that he may avoid be+ing &s;wept away into that aby&s;s which the anarchi&s;ts and infamous plunderers have opened before us:</P>
<P N="9">9. That by decreeing a levy of a &s;tated number of men ready to join in ma&s;s to de&s;troy utterly every faction in its &s;trong|hold, the Mar&s;eillois, who are &s;olicitous to fini&s;h a revolution which they began, and make the example which they have ju&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="276">
given an object of imitation, call upon every citizen to join them who is anxi|ous to de&s;erve well of mankind.</P>
<P>They have taken this preliminary &s;tep only in con&s;ideration of the urgency of the mea&s;ures to be adopted, &s;ubmitting them to the examination and the appro|bation of the whole &s;overeign body, with|out pretending to &s;et bounds to the zeal of the generous defenders of their coun|try, who &s;hall voluntarily come forward to &s;trengthen the phalanx of liberty. They hope that it will increa&s;e in its march, and that every citizen anxious for the public weal will bear a part:</P>
<P N="10">10. That in the colours of this army the &s;oldiers of the country &s;hall read in|&s;cribed the accompli&s;hment of every good law: "The republic united and undi|vided, re&s;pect for per&s;ons and property;" words of con&s;olation already graven on every heart:</P>
<P N="11">11. That we appeal to God, and to
<PB N="275" REF="277">
our arms, again&s;t the attempts that have been made on the unity of the national repre&s;entation, again&s;t the violence which has been exerci&s;ed on the per&s;onal liberty of our &s;pecial deputies, again&s;t the con|&s;piracies de&s;tructive of liberty, from which the &s;uperintendance of Providence has delivered us, of which Mar&s;eilles is pur&s;uing the accomplices who undertook to execute the mo&s;t horrible deeds within its walls. A popular tribunal, the guar|dian of e&s;tabli&s;hed and well regulated order, is carrying on the pro&s;ecution of the con&s;pirators, notwith&s;tanding the ob|&s;tacles with which it is &s;urrounded. In|ve&s;ted with the confidence of the people, and by them &s;upported, the mo&s;t impe|rious law, that of circum&s;tances, deter|mines the activity of its operations; and the people of Mar&s;eilles, far from de&s;erv|ing to be con&s;idered as di&s;obedient to the law, in making u&s;e of the &s;word to pu|ni&s;h the guilty, fulfil the fir&s;t of &s;ocial
<PB N="276" REF="278">
duties, which con&s;i&s;ts in the di&s;tribution of the mo&s;t exemplary ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is thus that the city of Mar&s;eilles, in addition to the motives ari&s;ing from the general danger of the republic, joins the detail of the particular grievances which affect its tranquillity, and explains the nece&s;&s;ity it is under of &s;ilencing its calumniators, who, in de&s;pair at not hav|ing &s;ucceeded in kindling the torch of di&s;cord among us, have dared to pre&s;ent it to the convention as the light of truth.</P>
<P>Republicans, the &s;ignal is given. The moments are precious, and the mea&s;ures are deci&s;ive. Let us march, let the law enter with us into Paris! and if you are unacquainted with the way, follow the traces of the blood of your brethren, which will lead you to the feet of its walls, from whence have i&s;&s;ued forth tho&s;e murderous &s;courges, tho&s;e &s;anguinary con&s;piracies, and that con&s;uming traffic of finance, the &s;ource of all our mi&s;ery.</P>

<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE accu&s;ation again&s;t me is founded wholly on the &s;uppo&s;ition of my being an accomplice with men called con&s;pira|tors. My friend&s;hip for a few of tho&s;e per|&s;ons is prior to the political circum&s;tances which form the charge again&s;t them. The corre&s;pondence I held with them by an intermediate channel, at the time of their departure from Paris, is altogether fo|reign to &s;tate affairs. I have had in truth no political corre&s;pondence; and in this re&s;pect I might ab&s;olutely deny the charge; yet, although I cannot be call|ed upon to give an account of my pri|vate affections, I may glory in them, as I do in the whole of my conduct, and I have nothing to conceal from the world.</P>
<P>I declare then, that I have received te&s;timonies of regret on account of my impri&s;onment, and was informed that
<PB N="279" REF="281">
Duperret had two letters for me; but whether written before or after my friends had left Paris, whether from one or two of them, I am altogether ignorant, &s;ince the&s;e letters have never reached me. At another time, I was earne&s;tly conjured to e&s;cape from my pri&s;on, and received offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the attempt, and to convey me to whatever place I &s;hould think proper. I was deterred from ac|cepting the&s;e offers, from con&s;iderations both of duty and honour; of duty, be|cau&s;e I would not injure tho&s;e to who&s;e care I was committed; of honour, &s;ince in all ca&s;es I &s;hould prefer expo&s;ing my|&s;elf to the con&s;equences of every po&s;&s;ible vexation, rather than incur the appear|ances of guilt, by a flight unworthy of my character. I &s;hould not have been &s;o carele&s;s with regard to my &s;afety on the 31&s;t of May, had I had an in|tention of effecting my e&s;cape at a later period. This is the extent of my con|nections
<PB N="280" REF="282">
with my friends who fled. Un|doubtedly if the communication had not been interrupted between us, or if I had not been re&s;trained by my impri&s;onment, I &s;hould have endeavoured to procure information concerning them, for I knew of no law that forbids it. Alas! in what age, or among&s;t what people were tho&s;e &s;entiments of e&s;teem and fidelity which bind men to each other, ever ac|counted a crime? I do not pretend to decide upon the mea&s;ures taken by tho&s;e who were pro&s;cribed: but I never will believe that tho&s;e men have intended ill, who&s;e integrity, patrioti&s;m, and generous devotion to their country I have &s;een &s;o clearly di&s;played. If they have erred, their errors are tho&s;e of virtue; they are overcome without being degraded; they are unfortunate in my eyes, without be|ing guilty. If I am criminal in offer|ing vows for their &s;afety, I declare my|&s;elf &s;o to the whole world. I am under
<PB N="281" REF="283">
no concern for their glory, and I wil|lingly &s;hare in the honour of being op|pre&s;&s;ed by their enemies. I have known the&s;e generous men who are accu&s;ed of having con&s;pired again&s;t their country. They were firm but humane republicans; they were per&s;uaded that good laws were nece&s;&s;ary to make the republic beloved by tho&s;e who had no confidence in its &s;tability: but this was indeed a more difficult ta&s;k than to murder them. The hi&s;tory of all ages has proyed that great talents are nece&s;&s;ary to lead men to vir|tue by good laws, while violence alone has been &s;ufficient to re&s;train them by terror, or annihilate them by death. I have heard my friends maintain that plenty, like happine&s;s, could only re&s;ult from an equitable government; that the omnipotence of bayonets might produce fear, but not bread. I have &s;een them animated by the warme&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m for the happine&s;s of the people, di&s;daining to
<PB N="282" REF="284">
flatter them, determined to fall rather the victims of their blindne&s;s, than de|ceive them. I own that the&s;e princi|ples and this conduct have appeared to me altogether different from tho&s;e of ty|rants and ambitious men, who amu&s;e the people only to en&s;lave them. It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons that I am filled with e&s;teem for the&s;e generous men. This error, if it be one, will go with me to the grave, and I &s;hall glory in following tho&s;e whom I could not accompany thither.</P>
<P>My defence, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, is more nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who are de&s;i|rous of being informed, than it is to my&s;elf. Con&s;cious of having fulfilled my duties, I look to the future with &s;ecu|rity and confidence. My ta&s;te for &s;tudy and my habits of retirement have kept me at a di&s;tance both from the follies of di&s;&s;ipation, and from the bu&s;tle of in|trigue. Enamoured of liberty, the va|lue of which I learnt from reflection,
<PB N="283" REF="285">
I viewed the revolution with tran&s;port, per&s;uaded that it was the epocha of the &s;ubver&s;ion of de&s;poti&s;m, which I dete&s;t; of the reformation of abu&s;es, under which I had often &s;ighed, while the fate of the unhappy and oppre&s;&s;ed hung upon my heart. I have followed the progre&s;s of the revolution with &s;olicitude. I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf on the &s;ubject with warmth; but I have never overpa&s;&s;ed the limits pre&s;cribed me by my &s;ex. Some ta|lents perhaps, a little philo&s;ophy, a greater degree of courage, and which in times of danger did not weaken that of my hu&s;|band, are probably what tho&s;e who knew me have imprudently a&s;cribed to me, and which may have contributed to make me enemies among&s;t tho&s;e by whom I was not known. Roland &s;ometimes em|ployed me as his &s;ecretary; and the ce|lebrated letter to the king, for in&s;tance, was copied wholly by me. This would be a good paper enough to frame part
<PB N="284" REF="286">
of my indictment, if the Au&s;trians were my pro&s;ecutors, and thought proper to extend the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the mini&s;ter to his wife. But Roland had long &s;ince di&s;played his &s;entiments, and his love of great principles. The evidence of this exi&s;ts in the numerous books which he has publi&s;hed during the&s;e fifteen years pa&s;t. His knowledge and his integrity are eminently his own; and he had no need of a wife to become a wi&s;e and faithful mini&s;ter. Neither conferences nor cabals have ever been held at his hou&s;e. His friends, his colleagues, who|ever they were, and his acquaintances met at his table once a week, where in very public conver&s;ation they di&s;cour&s;ed openly on tho&s;e topics in which every one was intere&s;ted. On the whole, the writ|ings of this mini&s;ter breathe throughout the love of order and peace, explaining in the mo&s;t affecting manner the be&s;t principles of morality and policy. They
<PB N="285" REF="287">
will for ever bear witne&s;s to his wi&s;dom, as the accounts he has given in bear wit|ne&s;s to his integrity.</P>
<P>I return to the crime imputed to me. I ob&s;erve that I had no intimate ac|quaintance with Duperret. I had &s;ome|times &s;een him, while my hu&s;band was mini&s;ter, but he had not vi&s;ited me dur|ing the &s;ix months that have elap&s;ed &s;ince Roland quitted the admini&s;tration: and I might make the &s;ame remark re|&s;pecting the other deputies who were our friends; which certainly does not tally with the accu&s;ation of con&s;piracy and &s;ecret under&s;tanding imputed to us. It is clear from my fir&s;t letter to Duperret, that I wrote to this deputy, only becau&s;e I found it difficult to write to any other, with the idea that he would be inclined to render me &s;ervice. My corre&s;pond|ence with him, therefore, was not a thing projected; it was not the &s;equel of any preceding connections; and it had no
<PB N="286" REF="288">
political view. It furni&s;hed me with an opportunity of receiving intelligence of tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent, and with whom I was in habits of friend&s;hip, altogether independent of political con&s;iderations. Such con&s;iderations formed no part of the corre&s;pondence which I held with them in the fir&s;t moments of their ab|&s;ence. No memorial to this effect is brought in evidence again&s;t me. Tho&s;e which are produced, only intimate that I &s;hare in the opinions of tho&s;e who are called con&s;pirators. This induction is founded, I own it to the world, and I glory in this conformity of &s;entiment; but I have never publi&s;hed the&s;e &s;enti|ments in any manner that can be im|puted to me as a crime. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h the being an accomplice in any project, it mu&s;t be proved that advice has been given, and means furni&s;hed. I have done neither; I am therefore not guilty in the eyes of the law; there is
<PB N="287" REF="289">
none which can condemn me; there exi&s;ts no fact for the application of any.</P>
<P>I know that in revolutions, law as well as ju&s;tice is often forgotten; and the evidence of this is, that I am at this bar. I am indebted for this pro&s;ecution only to tho&s;e prejudices and that violent hatred which bur&s;t forth amid&s;t great convul&s;ions, and which, in general, fix upon tho&s;e who are placed in con&s;picu|ous &s;ituations, or who are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s energy of character. It would have been ea&s;y for me to have avoided this trial which I fore&s;aw; but I thought it more becoming to meet it: I thought that I owed this example to my country: I thought that if I &s;hould be condemned, I &s;hould leave to my tyrants the odium of &s;acrificing a woman who had no other crime than perhaps &s;ome talents of which &s;he &s;eldom availed her&s;elf, great zeal for the intere&s;ts of mankind, courage to adhere to her unfortunate friends, and to
<PB N="288" REF="290">
render homage to truth at the hazard of her life. Tho&s;e who have true greatne&s;s of &s;oul throw away &s;elfi&s;h feelings, re|member that they belong only to the &s;pecies, and look to futurity for their reward. I belong to the virtuous and per&s;ecuted Roland. I was in habits of friend&s;hip with men whom ignorance and the jealous hatred of low, vulgar minds have pro&s;cribed, and murdered. I am to peri&s;h al&s;o, becau&s;e it is con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of tyranny to &s;acrifice tho&s;e whom it has cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed, and annihilate even every witne&s;s of its crimes. Under both the&s;e titles you ought to condemn me to die, and I await my &s;en|tence. When innocence mounts the &s;caf|fold to which it is condemned by error or wickedne&s;s, it reaches the goal of triumph. May I be the la&s;t victim that &s;hall be &s;acrificed! I &s;hall leave with joy this unhappy land, which is de&s;troying the good, and drinking in the blood of
<PB N="289" REF="291">
the ju&s;t. O truth, my country, friend|&s;hip, &s;acred objects, &s;entiments dear to my heart, receive my la&s;t offering! My life was devoted to you, and ye alone &s;pread a &s;oftne&s;s and grace over my la&s;t moments! God of heaven! enlighten this unhappy people, for who&s;e liberty I breathe my warme&s;t vows.&mdash;Liberty!&mdash;to tho&s;e great &s;ouls it eminently belongs who de&s;pi&s;e death, and who can meet it with courage: but it was not formed for weak minds, who compound with crime, while they conceal their &s;elf-love and their cowardice under the name of prudence. It was not formed for tho&s;e profligate men, who, ri&s;ing from their beds of debauchery, or creeping forth from a &s;ink of wretchedne&s;s, run and bathe them|&s;elves in the blood that &s;treams from the &s;caffolds. But it is the guardian of a wi&s;e and humane people who practi&s;e ju&s;tice, de&s;pi&s;e flatterers, know their true friends, and revere truth. As long as
<PB N="290" REF="292">
you &s;hall not form &s;uch a people, O my fellow-citizens! you will talk in vain of liberty; you will live only in a &s;tate of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, of which each of you will fall the victim in your turn; you will a&s;k for bread, but you will find only mangled carca&s;&s;es, and you will end in being &s;laves.</P>
<P>I have concealed neither my &s;entiments, or opinions. I know that a Roman lady was &s;ent to execution under Tiberius, for having lamented her &s;on. I know that in times of blindne&s;s and party-&s;pirit, who|ever dares to avow him&s;elf the friend of condemned or pro&s;cribed men, expo&s;es him&s;elf to &s;hare their fate: but I de|&s;pi&s;e death. I have never feared any thing but guilt; and I would not pur|cha&s;e my life at the price of meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Unhappy times, unhappy people, when the obligation of rendering ju&s;tice to injured virtue is be&s;et with danger; but too happy are tho&s;e who have cou|rage
<PB N="291" REF="293">
to brave it.&mdash;It is now for you to examine if it be compatible with your intere&s;ts to condemn in defect of evi|dence, for &s;imple opinions only, and without the &s;upport of any law.</P>
