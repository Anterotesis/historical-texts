<HEAD>THE
PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1711, <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the Prophet, who
formrrly Prophe&s;ied and Foretold you &s;o many Remarkable
Things, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1707; all which, as is well known, are
mo&s;t exactly come to pa&s;s; and having by my Knowledge and
Acquaintance for above One Hundred Years with the Stars, and
with utmo&s;t diligence applied my &s;elf to know by the A&s;pects of
Heavenly Bodies and other Methods; al&s;o what &s;hall happen on
the Earth. I &s;ay, that I the afore&s;aid <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
am moved, as well by A&s;trological Vi&s;ion, as the e&s;pecial <HI>Genius</HI>
of tho&s;e Powers which influences human Bodies, to make known
to the World what &s;hall come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>By this Prophetick Skill, I once among&s;t other well known E|vents
Predicted and Foretold you, That <HI>John Partridge</HI> the
Almanack-maker &s;hould Die, and be Buried on, or before &s;uch a
day of the Month, which, as you all know, came to pa&s;s to a
Moment.</P>
<P>Having therefore obtained &s;uch an undoubted Skill and Judg|ment
in the&s;e mo&s;t u&s;eful and advantageous Things: I can no
longer refrain from letting my Country-men of this Nation, know
the great Revolutions of Kingdoms and States, and the dread|ful
Things that &s;hall &s;uddenly come to pa&s;s in the Earth. I am
al&s;o the more earne&s;tly moved to this great and wonderful Vnder|taking,
becau&s;e it is revealed to me by the &s;ame wonderful Pro|phetick
Skill, that &s;uch great and terrible Things, &s;uch &s;urpri|zing
Events, and &s;uch De&s;&s;olations, are preparing in the World,
and &s;hall come to pa&s;s this en&s;uing Year, as were never &s;een by
the Eyes of any Living, or would enter into the Conceptions of
any Man to foretell, had they not by an extraordinary acquired
Skill in knowing and determining &s;uch Things, been fore&s;een by
me <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Sen</HI></P>
<P>And thus, hone&s;t Reader, being nothing doubting of thy dili|gent
Attention to what I &s;hall Prophe&s;ie, I bid thee Farewell.</P>

Twelve Prophe&s;ies for the Year, 1711.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY I.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall begin my Years of Wonders as the Cour&s;e of
Nature begins it; Councils and Confederacies act
all the Courts and Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the time of
Year is only for &s;uch Things; but as here the Seeds
of Blood are &s;own, the plentiful Crop that is to follow,
derives from and is produced by the Private Combina|tions
of Men and Devils to di&s;turb the World.</P>
<P>Three Scenes of Council &s;hall this Month di&s;cover them|&s;elves
in the World, what the Production or Effects &s;hall
be of either of them, I &s;hall farther lay open in my next;
the&s;e are Councils in this Nation, Councils of <HI>France,</HI>
Councils of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The Councils of this Nation &s;hall produce great Strife,
Faction and Malecontent &s;tirs, with Heat and Animo&s;i|ties
among the &s;everal Parties that are among us, to the
great Encouragement of our Enemies, and to the great
Di&s;couragement of good Men; yet the Calmne&s;s and Pru|dence
of &s;ome &s;hall le&s;&s;en, or at lea&s;t protract the Danger
for a while; Di&s;putes of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Affairs &s;hall em|broil
this I&s;land, and tho&s;e People who regard neither
God nor Devil, &s;hall make the greate&s;t &s;tir about Reli|gion,
every Church (however &s;afe) cries out they are
in danger, and the Debauchees of the Nation learn to
play the Phari&s;ee, and &s;ay to their Neighbour, <HI>Stand off,
I am holier than thou.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Europe</HI> tremble at what is contriving now in the
Cabinets of Princes, which, like the Seeds of Di&s;tem|pers
<PB N="5" REF="4">
in the Body, will quickly break out in Feavors,
Fluxes, Cankers, Calentures, and all the Symbals of
the Bodily Di&s;tempers of Men in the Politicks of Na|tions.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> con&s;ults now how to &s;upport <HI>Spain,</HI> embroil
the Emperor, bring home the <HI>Swede,</HI> re&s;tore <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
doze <HI>Savoy,</HI> fright the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and divide the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
and he will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure accompli&s;h them all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turk</HI> con&s;ults how to humble the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> &s;ub|ject
the <HI>Pole,</HI> and keep fa&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>; but
the <HI>Swede</HI> will make a Cats Foot of the <HI>Turk.</HI> play him a
&s;lipery Trick, get out of his hands, and leave him to
fight with the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> where the War
&s;hall be bloody, cruel, &s;ucce&s;sful to neither &s;ide, and only
u&s;eful to &s;hew God's Judgments on both.</P>

<HEAD>PROPHECY II.</HEAD>
<P>After Con&s;ultations comes Preparation, this takes up
all <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Return of the Spring, every Na|tion
Struggles with them&s;elves to make their Preparati|ons
for War formidable, and with one another to be
fir&s;t ready for the Bloody Work they are about.</P>
<P>The Confederates attempt vigorou&s;ly to &s;uccour King
<HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> but, <HI>O the Succe&s;s!</HI>&mdash;<HI>Spain</HI> not yet
ripe for Deliverance re&s;i&s;ts her Friends, embraces her
Enemies, and &s;truggles hard again&s;t what &s;he believes &s;he
mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>But this is not the Generation that mu&s;t enjoy the
Fruit of this Strife, the Chiefs fight for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
neither part obtain it, both take their long Journey be|fore
the War is over, and the Game at Che&s;s is left to
Po&s;terity to play it out. <HI>Philip</HI> goes fir&s;t, I <HI>I&s;aac Bicker|&s;taff,</HI>
Elder, having the Second &s;ight, &s;ee the famous Mau|&s;oleum
for the young Hero of <HI>Bourbon</HI> in the E&s;curial at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and there lies the hope of a Crown, yet the
<HI>French</HI> Monarch with the &s;ame Ob&s;tinacy &s;upports the
War, maintains the Breach, and prompts the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;till to defend them&s;elves again&s;t their own Happine&s;s.
<HI>Philip</HI> before he dies fights three Battles with the Confede|rates,
and is Victor in two of them, but dies in <HI>May,</HI> and
leaves the War to be carried on with le&s;s Succe&s;s than be|fore;
&s;hould it be left to the Merits of the Per&s;ons, <HI>Phi|lip</HI>
de&s;erves the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> far better than <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s,</HI> as
he appears active, valiant, brave, and unwearied in the
Face of his Enemies, however he dies King, and Sleeps
in Peace, tho' he never Reigned &s;o.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Swedes</HI> prepare to break out of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> and
it appears that <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Swedes</HI> are in a &s;trict Con|federacy,
and they &s;hall be more fatal to <HI>Europe</HI> than the
League with the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;ending Forces from <HI>Stockholm</HI> carry the
Plague into <HI>Pomerania,</HI> from whence it &s;preads to the ut|mo&s;t
Corners of <HI>Europe</HI>; Kings and Emperors, &s;hall flye
from this dreadful Enemy, but find no Rece&s;s; Plague finds
them out, and as War &s;preads, Pe&s;tilence goes hand in
hand, and both &s;hall con&s;ume and de&s;troy without Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> is all bu&s;ie in fitting out their Armies, the Drums
beat in every Kingdom for Soldiers, not a Prince or State
in this whole part of the World, but &s;hall be embark'd
in the Quarrels of <HI>Europe,</HI> and be engag'd in War either
as Principal or as Auxilary.</P>
<P>The Armies of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are in the Field fir&s;t,
and much Blood &s;hall be &s;hed in <HI>Spain</HI> before the end of
<HI>February.</HI> The Confederates Struggle hard, but Things
do not an&s;wer the Expence.</P>

<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY III.</HEAD>
<P>The Preparations for War are fini&s;h'd, now the Troops
on all &s;ides appear in the Field; a third Battle in <HI>Spain</HI>&mdash;<HI>Philip</HI>'s
Forces flie in their Turn, tho' no great advan|tage
made of the Victory. In <HI>March</HI> the <HI>French</HI> make two
great Efforts upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> one to join the <HI>Swede,</HI> who
Marches towards the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> towards <HI>Saxony</HI>;
the other towards <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the <HI>Germans</HI> in no readi|ne&s;s
to receive them, &s;uffer all manner of Mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
The Dauphin of <HI>France</HI> dies; the Pope &s;ickens and is
very weak; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> relap&s;es; but the King of
<HI>France</HI> more vigorous than ever, pu&s;hes all before him
the beginning of Summer.</P>
<P>A great Prodigy appears in the Ea&s;t; two Kings &s;trug|gling
to make it appear which was the better Chri&s;tian,
he that changed his Religion to gain a Crown, or he that
flies to <HI>Mahomet</HI> to recover his Crown. The <HI>Turks</HI> ad|vance
now in three great Armies, and one Battle is fought
before the end of <HI>March,</HI> in which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
gains &s;ome ground, but is wounded in the Action, and
makes no Advantage of the Battle.</P>
<P>Now the mi&s;erable Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> approaches, the
War begins in <HI>Poland, Mu&s;covy, Hungary,</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
and in <HI>Spain.</HI> In <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> they cannot be ready
&s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>A great Battle on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in which
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> do as they u&s;e to do, <HI>viz.</HI> run away; the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> ravage <HI>Portugal,</HI> ruin three Provinces; if the&s;e
were not <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had not had the Victory;
and if the&s;e were not <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> would be
no more a Kingdom, but the &s;loth of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;aves
<HI>Portugal</HI> till <HI>England</HI> relieve her.</P>
<P>A great Mini&s;ter of State dies in the Month of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England</HI> feels great want of Trade, great want of Mo|ney,
and great lo&s;s of Credit, which puts her to many
Inconveniencies; but let her prepare for wor&s;e Things

<P>Note, <HI>In this place in the Original Manu&s;cript, the following
Paragraph was In&s;erted, which the Printer in the</HI> North <HI>de|clin'd
to put in, for fear of giving Offence.</HI></P>
<P>The Words are the&s;e,<Q>The Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> feels a Blow this Month,
which Changes the Mea&s;ures of <HI>Europe</HI>; The
Emperor re&s;igns to Fate; and the Choi&s;e both of
a new Emperor, and new King of <HI>Spain,</HI> takes up
the Con&s;ultations of all the Courts in Chri&s;ten|dom.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
The Empire feels hard Things, be&s;et on every &s;ide, and
weak in Arms, as well as confu&s;ed in Council, the
<HI>Swedes</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> invade <HI>Bavaria</HI>; the <HI>Hungarians</HI>
&s;upported by the <HI>Turks</HI> recover all they have lo&s;t in <HI>Hun|gary</HI>;
the <HI>French</HI> make a terrible Eruption over the
<HI>Rhine</HI>; the Circles of <HI>Swabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> &s;uffer incre|dible
Evils, and Blood, Famine, and Pe&s;tilence, rages
over the Empire.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> re&s;tored to his Dominions by the
<HI>French,</HI> dies of the Plague in <HI>April,</HI> and the Affairs of that
Electorate come to &s;ome Settlement by the &s;ucceeding of
his Son, who has other Things to mind than War. The
Elector of <HI>Cologn,</HI> Brother to the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> goes to &s;ee
his Brother rein&s;tated, but lives not to return to his own
Principality.</P>
<P>The Emperor retreats from <HI>Vienna</HI> for fear of the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and goes to <HI>Prague,</HI> but the Plague
gets into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and &s;eparates the Imperial Court:
&s;ome great Princes die of that Di&s;temper al&s;o.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>April</HI> a great City in <HI>Flanders</HI> be&s;ieged
by the <HI>French,</HI> but the Confederates coming on, they
rai&s;e their Siege; they are made amends by &s;urprizing
another &s;trong Town in the middle of the Day. A Bloody
Action in <HI>Flanders</HI> between part of the Armies, in which
the <HI>French</HI> &s;eem to have the Advantage, but decline com|ing
to a deci&s;ive Battle, and draw off from the Field.
Death in this Battle puts an end to the Ambition of two
or three great Men on either &s;ide. <HI>Bou&s;&s;lers</HI> lies now in
the Bed of Honour, and his Grace <GAP DESC="blank"> &s;hall bear
him Company into the other World, &s;o he that was en|vied
before &s;hall be pitied now for want of a Rival.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame <HI>April</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Forces Bombard <HI>Barcelo|na,</HI>
but Relief comes to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and in his turn he
cha&s;es them; now the Face of Things change in <HI>Spain,</HI>
and <HI>Philip</HI>'s Fate approaches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> now prepare to invade <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">nen,</HI> and make
another fruitle&s;s Attempt upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Countries, from whence they are again beaten, and bring
<PB N="9" REF="8">
back Poverty and the Plague, which not only vi&s;its their
Capital City, but makes &s;ad havock in their Court, not
excepting the Royal Family.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> demits his Crown in favour of

<P>Now <HI>Europe</HI> begins to Tremble, the People find an

Work enough to Bury their Dead.</P>
<P>By the end of <HI>May</HI> the various kinds of this new
Plague has Touch'd mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> as
before bring it to <HI>Pomeren,</HI> thence they carry it to <HI>Saxony
(Via Brandenburgh)</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> give it to the <HI>Bohemians,</HI>
the <HI>Bohemians</HI> to the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> they to the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> and

<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> bring it another way from <HI>Poland,</HI>

<P>Innumerable Numbers of People &s;hall peri&s;h by this

Heaven did not, or could not, de&s;troy them fa&s;t enough,
&s;till make War, and the Kings of the Earth apply them|&s;elves
to their ruinous De&s;igns, with as much fury as ever.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> now appears in his own Colours,
and &s;hall in the Month of <HI>May</HI> be in full march to enter
<HI>Poland,</HI> if not <HI>Germany</HI>; but his Army con&s;i&s;ting of many

much Fighting and he may &s;ee that Heaven does
not ble&s;s his Ambitious De&s;igns with &s;ucce&s;s an&s;werable

and in whom was his chief Confidence, die of the

<P>The Month of <HI>May</HI> lays King <HI>Philip</HI> low in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Charles</HI> Triumphs over his Enemy a third time, but his
Joy, like all Temporal things, is but of a &s;mall duration.
The War in <HI>Spain</HI> co&s;ts much Money, much Blood, much

Blood might have been better &s;pent.</P>
<P>Another Bloody Action between the Armies on the

in <HI>Germany, Sile&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> yet hopes and promi&s;es
&s;upport them, and they di&s;pair not yet.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> lies &s;till; now the Sun keeps the Peace there, the
exce&s;&s;ive heats give a rece&s;s from Action, and gives time
to our ungovernable Soldiers to kill them&s;elves with Eat|ing
ripe Grapes, Drinking new Wine, and gorging them|&s;elves
with the Lu&s;cious Fruits of a Luxurious Climate. A
new General and new Councils produce new effects there,
but the Army &s;uffers much by Di&s;ea&s;es, for which we &s;up|ply
the Grave with new Recruits for the <HI>Antum</HI> Campaign.</P>
<P>A rich plentiful Harve&s;t in <HI>Britain</HI> makes the Hearts of
the Country glad, and <HI>Britain</HI> proves this Year the Grana|ry
of <HI>Europe</HI>; a great increa&s;e, and a good Market, re|vives

<P>Another terrible battle in the Northern Countries;
