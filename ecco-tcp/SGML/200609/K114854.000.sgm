<P>IT is an acknowledg'd Truth, that nothing is &s;o dear to an hone&s;t Man as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the ju&s;t Vindication of his Character, when it is in|juriou&s;ly attack'd by any Man. The Per&s;on I have at pre&s;ent Cau&s;e to complain of, is indeed in very melancholy Circum&s;tances, it having pleas'd God to deprive him of his Sen&s;es, which may extenuate the Crime in Him. But I &s;hould be wanting in my Duty, not only to my &s;elf, but al&s;o to my Fellow-Creatures, to whom my
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Talents may prove of benefit, &s;hou'd I &s;uffer my Profe&s;&s;ion or Hone&s;ty to be unde&s;ervedly a&s;|pers'd. I have therefore re&s;olv'd to give the Publick an account of all that has pa&s;t between that unhappy Gentleman and my &s;elf.</P>
<P>On the 20<HI>th</HI> in&s;tant, while I was in my Clo&s;et pondering the Ca&s;e of one of my Patients, I heard a Knocking at my Door, upon opening of which enter'd an old Woman with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that without my A&s;|&s;i&s;tance her Ma&s;ter would be utterly ruin'd. I was forc'd to interrupt her Sorrow by enquiring her Ma&s;ter's Name and Place of Abode. She told me he was one Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">is</HI> an Officer of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, who was taken ill of a violent Frenzy la&s;t <HI>April,</HI> and had continu'd in tho&s;e melancholy Circum&s;tances, with few or no In|tervals. Upon this I ask'd her &s;ome Que&s;tions relating to his Humour and Extravagancies, that I might the better know under what Regi|men to put him, when the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;tem|per was found out. Alas, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, this Day fortnight in the Morning a poor &s;imple Child came to him from the Printer's; the Boy had no &s;ooner enter'd the Room, but he cry'd out, <HI>the Devil was come.</HI> He often &s;tares gha&s;t|fully, raves aloud, and mutters between his Teeth the Word <HI>Cator,</HI> or <HI>Cato,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch thing. Now, Doctor, this <HI>Cator</HI> is certainly a <HI>Witch,</HI> and my poor Ma&s;ter is under an evil Tongue: for I have heard him &s;ay <HI>Cator</HI> has be|witch'd the whole Nation. It pitied my very Heart, to think that a Man of my Ma&s;ter's Un|der&s;tanding and great Scholar&s;hip, (who, as the
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Child told me, had a Book of his own in Print,) &s;hould talk &s;o outragiou&s;ly. Upon this I went and laid out a Groat for a Hor&s;hoe, which is at this time nail'd on the Thre&s;hold of his Door; but I don't find my Ma&s;ter is at all the better for it; he prepetually &s;tarts and runs to the Win|dow when any one knocks, crying out, <HI>S' death! a Me&s;&s;enger from the French King! I &s;hall die in the</HI> Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, the Old Woman pre&s;ented me with a Viol of his Urine; upon Examination of which I preceiv'd the whole Temperament of his Body to be exceeding <HI>hot.</HI> I therefore in|&s;tantly took my Cane and my Beaver, and re|pair'd to the Place where he dwelt.</P>
<P>When I came to his Lodgings near <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> up <HI>three Pair</HI> of Stairs, (which I &s;hould not have publi&s;h'd in this manner, but that this Lunatick <HI>conceals</HI> the Place of his Re&s;idence on purpo&s;e to prevent the good Offices of tho&s;e charitable <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> who might attempt his Cure) when I came into the Room, I found this unfortunate Gentleman &s;eated on his Bed, with Mr. <HI>Bernard Lintott,</HI> Book&s;eller, on the one &s;ide of him, and a grave elderly Gen|tleman on the other, who, as I have &s;ince learnt, calls him&s;elf a <HI>Grammarian;</HI> the Latitude of who&s;e Countenance was not a little eclips'd by the Fullne&s;s of his Peruke. As I am a black lean Man, of a pale Vi&s;age, and hang my Clothes on &s;omewhat &s;lovenly, I no &s;ooner went in but he frown'd upon me, and cry'd out with vio|lence, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>S'Death,</HI> a <HI>Frenchman!</HI> I am betray'd to the Tyrant! who cou'd have thought the
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Queen would have deliver'd me up to <HI>France</HI> in this Treaty, and lea&s;t of all that you, my Friends, wou'd have been in a Con&s;piracy again&s;t me?'</Q>&mdash;Sir, &s;aid I, here is neither Plot nor Con&s;piracy, but for your advantage. The Recovery of your Sen&s;es requires my At|tendance, and your Friends &s;ent for me on no other account. I then took a particular Survey of his Per&s;on, and the Furniture and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Apartment. His A&s;pect was furious, his Eyes were rather fiery than lively, which he roll'd about in an uncommon manner. He often o|pen'd his Mouth, as if he wou'd have utter'd &s;ome Matter of Importance, but the Sound &s;eem'd lo&s;t inwardly. His Beard was grown, which they told me he would not &s;uffer to be &s;hav'd, believing the modern Dramatick Poets had corrupted all the Barbers in the Town to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of cutting his Throat. His Eye-brows were grey, long, and grown to|gether, which he knit with Indignation when any thing was &s;poken, in&s;omuch that he &s;eem'd not to have &s;mooth'd his Forehead for many Years. His Flannel Night Cap, which was ex|ceedingly begrim'd with Sweat and Dirt, hung upon his Left Ear; the Flap of his Breeches dangled between his Legs, and the Rolls of his Stockings fell down to his Ankles.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd his Room was hung with <HI>old Tape|&s;try,</HI> which had &s;everal Holes in it, caus'd, as the Old Woman inform'd me, by his having cut out of it the Heads of divers <HI>Tyrants,</HI> the Fierce|ne&s;s of who&s;e Vi&s;ages had much provoked him. On all &s;ides of his Room were pinned a great
<PB N="9" REF="9">
many Sheets of a Tragedy called <HI>Cato,</HI> with Notes on the Margin with his own Hand. The Words <HI>Ab&s;urd, Mon&s;trous, Execrable,</HI> were every where written in &s;uch large Characters, that I could read them without my Spectacles. By the Fre-&s;ide lay Three-farthings-worth of Small-coal in a <HI>Spectator,</HI> and behind the Door huge Heaps of Papers of the &s;ame Title, which his Nur&s;e inform'd me &s;he had convey'd thither out of his &s;ight, believing they were Books of the Black Art; for her Ma&s;ter never read in them, but he was either quite <HI>mop'd,</HI> or in <HI>raving Fits;</HI> There was nothing neat in the whole Room, except &s;ome Books on his Shelves very well bound and gilded, who&s;e Names I had ne|ver before heard of, nor I believe are any where el&s;e to be found; &s;uch as <HI>Gibraltar, a Comedy; Remarks on Prince Arthur; the Grounds of Critici&s;m in Poetry; an E&s;&s;ay on publick Spirit.</HI> The only one I had any Knowledge of was a <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> interleav'd. The whole Floor was cover'd with Manu&s;cripts, as thick as a Pa&s;t|ry Cook's Shop on a Chri&s;tmas Eve. On his Table were &s;ome Ends of Ver&s;e and of Candles; a Gallipot of Ink with a yellow Pen in it, and a Pot of half-dead Ale cover'd with a <HI>Longinus.</HI></P>
<P>As I was ca&s;ting my Eyes round on all this odd Furniture with &s;ome Earne&s;tne&s;s and A&s;to|ni&s;hment, and in a profound Silence, I was on a &s;udden &s;urpriz'd to hear the Man &s;peak in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Beware, Doctor, that it fare not with you as with your Predece&s;&s;or the famous <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> whom the mi&s;taken Citizens of <HI>Abdera</HI> &s;ent
<PB N="10" REF="10">
for in this very manner to cure the Philo&s;o|pher <HI>Democritus;</HI> he return'd full of Admi|ration at the Wi&s;dom of that Per&s;on whom he had &s;uppos'd a Lunatic. Behold, Doctor, it was thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf and all the great Antients &s;pent their Days and Nights, wrapt up in Critici&s;m, and be&s;et all around with their own Writings. As for me, whom you &s;ee in the &s;ame manner, be a&s;&s;ur'd I have none other Di&s;ea&s;e than a Swelling in my Legs, whereof I &s;ay no more, &s;ince your Art may further cer|tify you."</Q></P>
<P>I began now to be in hopes that his Ca&s;e had been mi&s;repre&s;ented, and that he was not &s;o far gone, but &s;ome timely Medicines might recover him. I therefore proceeded to the proper Que|ries, which with the An&s;wers made to me, I &s;hall &s;et down in Form of Dialogue, in the very Words they were &s;poken, becau&s;e I would not omit the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance in this Narrative; and I call my Con&s;cience to witne&s;s, as if upon Oath, that I &s;hall tell the Truth without addi|tion or diminution.</P>

<P>I took Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> home with me, in order to have our Wounds dre&s;t, and laid hold of that Opportunity of entering into Di&s;cour&s;e with him about the Madne&s;s of this Per&s;on, of whom he gave me the following remarkable Relation:</P>

of Poetical Ju&s;tice, and ca&s;t it into the Street.

<Q><L>Some have at fir&s;t for Wits, then Poets pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Turn'd Ctiticks next, and prov'd plain Fools at la&s;t.</L></Q>
He flung down the Book in a terrible Fury, and cried out, <HI>By G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d he means Me.</HI></P>
<P>That being in his Company on a certain Time, when <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was mention'd as of a contrary Opinion to Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> he &s;wore the &s;aid <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> was a <HI>Ra&s;cal,</HI> with other defamatory Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, which gave Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> a very ill Opi|nion of the &s;aid <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>
<P>That about two Months &s;ince, he came again into the Shop, and ca&s;t &s;everal &s;u&s;picious Looks on a Gentleman that &s;tood by him, after which he de&s;ired &s;ome Information concerning that Per|&s;on. He was no &s;ooner acquainted that the Gen|tleman was a new Author, and that his fir&s;t Piece was to be publi&s;h'd in a few Days, but he drew his Sword upon him, and had not my Servant luckily catch'd him by the Sleeve, I might have lo&s;t one Author upon the &s;pot, and another the next Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Upon recollecting all the&s;e Circum&s;tances, Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> was entirely of Opinion, that he had been mad for &s;ome Time; and I doubt not but this whole Narrative mu&s;t &s;ufficiently con|vince

<P>Fourthly, Knowing that I had much Practice in the City, he reported at the <HI>Royal Exchange, Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> and other Places adjacent, that I was a foreign Spy, employ'd by the <HI>French</HI> King to convey him into <HI>France;</HI> that I bound him Hand and Foot; and that, if his Friend had not bur&s;t from his Confinement to his Relief, he had been at this Hour in the <HI>Ba&s;tile.</HI></P>

<P>Every Body knows that the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th In&s;tant, publi&s;h'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <HI>Court Poems,</HI> in the Preface whereof they were attributed to a Lady of Quality, Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Gay;</HI> by which indi&s;|creet Method though he had e&s;cap'd one Revenge, there were &s;till two behind in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Now on the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> en&s;uing, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven, Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> a neigh|b'ring Book&s;eller, de&s;ired a Conference with Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> about &s;ettling a <HI>Title-Page,</HI> inviting him at the &s;ame Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> (who is not the only In&s;tance how Per|&s;ons of bright Parts may be carry'd away by the In&s;tigation of the Devil) found Means to con|vey him&s;elf into the &s;ame Room, under Pretence of Bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> who it &s;eems is the Printer of his <HI>Homer.</HI> This Gentleman with a &s;eeming Coolne&s;s, reprimanded Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> for wrongfully a&s;cribing to him the afore&s;aid Poems: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf by declaring that one of his Authors (Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> by Name) gave the Copies to the Pre&s;s, and wrote the <HI>Pre|face.</HI> Upon this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (being to all appea|rance reconcil'd) very civily drank a Gla&s;s of Sack to Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> which he as civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Ta&s;te diffe|red not from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer felt &s;oon after, that &s;ome poi&s;onous Drug had been &s;ecretly in|fu&s;ed therein.</P>

About eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife ob&s;erving his Colour chang'd, &s;aid, <HI>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Bloody Sick;</HI> and incontinently fell a vomiting and &s;training in an uncommon and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as green as Gra&s;s.

<P>Here Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> interrupted. Why not find <HI>another Book&s;eller, Brother Curll?</HI> and then took Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> a&s;ide and whi&s;per'd him: <HI>Sir, As &s;oon as</HI> Curll <HI>is dead, I &s;hall be glad to talk with you over a Pint at the</HI> Devil.</P>

<P>After he had &s;aid this, he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He de&s;ir'd his Wife to &s;tep into the Shop for a <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> and read it by the Help of a Candle with|out He&s;itation.

<P>The poor Man continued for &s;ome Hours with all his di&s;con&s;olate Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Di&s;&s;olution; when of a &s;udden he was &s;urprizingly relieved by a plen|tiful foetid Stool, which obliged them all to re|tire out of the Room.

<P>AVARICE (as Sir <HI>Richard</HI> in the Third Page of his E&s;&s;ays hath elegantly ob&s;erv'd) <HI>is an inordinate Impul&s;e of the Soul towards the ama&s;&s;ing or heaping together a Superfluity of Wealth without the lea&s;t Regard of applying it to its proper U&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>And how the Mind of Man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this Vice, may be &s;een every Day both in the City and Suburbs thereof. It has been always e&s;teemed by <HI>Plato, Puffendorf</HI> and <HI>Socrates,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="41">
as the darling Vice of old Age: But now our young Men are turn'd U&s;urers and Stock-job|bers; and, in&s;tead of lu&s;ting after the real Wives and Daughters of our rich Citizens, they covet nothing but their Money and E&s;tates. Strange Change of Vice! when the Concupi|&s;cence of Youth is converted into the Covetou&s;|ne&s;s of Age, and tho&s;e Appetites are now be|come VENAL which &s;hould be VENEREAL.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, let us &s;hew you how many of the ancient Worthies and Heroes of Anti|quity have been undone and ruin'd by this Deadly Sin of Avarice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the Liberty to begin with <HI>Brutus,</HI> that noble <HI>Roman.</HI> Does not <HI>Aetian</HI> inform us that he received Fifty Broad Pieces for the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of that renowned Emperor <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who fell a Sacrifice to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as Sir <HI>Edmund Bury Godfrey</HI> did to the <HI>Pa|pi&s;ts?</HI></P>
<P>Did not <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> let in the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into <HI>Carthage</HI> for a Sum of Money, where they barbarou&s;ly put out the other Eye of the famous <HI>Hannibal?</HI> As <HI>Herodotus</HI> hath it in his ninth Book upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Medals.</P>
<P>Even the great <HI>Cato</HI> (as the late Mr. <HI>Addi|&s;on</HI> hath very well ob&s;erv'd) though otherwi&s;e a Gentleman of good Sen&s;e, was not un&s;ully'd by this pecuniary Contagion: For he &s;old <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Artaxerxes Longimanus</HI> for a hundred <HI>Rix-Dollars,</HI> which in our Money will amount to two <HI>Talents</HI> and thirty <HI>Se&s;tertii,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Demoiver</HI>'s Calculation. <HI>See</HI> He&s;iod <HI>in his</HI> 7<HI>th Chapter of</HI> Fea&s;ts <HI>and</HI> Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="42">
Actuated by the &s;ame Diabolical Spirit of Gain, <HI>Scylla</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;ul &s;hot <HI>Alcibiades</HI> the Senator with a Pi&s;tol, and robb'd him of &s;everal <HI>Bank Bills</HI> and <HI>Chequer Notes</HI> to an immen&s;e Value; for which he came to an un|timely End, and was deny'd <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Burial. Hence comes the Proverb <HI>incidat in Scyllam.</HI></P>
<P>To come near to our own Times, and give you one modern In&s;tance (tho' well known and often quoted by Hi&s;torians, <HI>viz. Echard, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus, Virgil, Horace,</HI> and others) 'Tis that, I mean, of the famous <HI>God|frey</HI> of <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> one of the great Heroes of the Holy War, who robb'd <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queen of <HI>Egypt</HI> of a Diamond Necklace, Ear-Rings, and a <HI>Tompion</HI>'s Gold Watch (which was given her by <HI>Mark Antony</HI>) all the&s;e things were found in <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s Breeches Pocket, when he was kill'd at the Seige of <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></P>
<P>Who then can wonder after &s;o many great and illu&s;trious Examples that Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll</HI> the Stationer, &s;hould renounce the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> for the <HI>Mammon</HI> of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and barter his precious Faith for the filthy Pro&s;|pect of Lucre in the pre&s;ent Fluctuation of <HI>Stocks.</HI></P>
<P>It having been ob&s;erved to Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> by &s;ome of his ingenious Authors, (who I fear are not over-charg'd with any Religion) what im|men&s;e Sums the <HI>Jews</HI> had got by <HI>Bubbles,</HI> &amp;c. he immediately turned his Mind from the Bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was educated, but thriv'd little, and re&s;olv'd to quit his Shop, for <HI>Change Alley.</HI> Whereupon falling into Com|pany

with the <HI>Jews</HI> at their Club at the Sign of the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> they began to tamper with him upon the mo&s;t important Points of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> which he for &s;ome time zealou&s;ly, and <HI>like a good Chri&s;tian ob&s;tinately</HI> defended. They promi&s;ed him <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and many other Advantages <HI>here|after,</HI> but he artfully in&s;inuated that he was more inclinable to li&s;ten to <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Gain. They took the Hint, and promis'd him that immedi|ately upon his Conver&s;ion to their Per&s;ua&s;ion he &s;hould become as rich as a <HI>Jew.</HI></P>
<P>They made u&s;e likewi&s;e of &s;everal other Ar|guments, to wit,</P>
<P>That the wi&s;e&s;t Man that ever was, and in|a&s;much the riche&s;t, beyond all peradventure, was a <HI>Jew,</HI> videlicet <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>David</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, was a <HI>Jew</HI> al&s;o. And mo&s;t of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> are &s;u&s;pected for holding the &s;ame Doctrine.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> at fir&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly deny'd, for indeed he thought them <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and &s;o far was he from giving way to their Temptations, that to convince them of his <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> he call'd for a <HI>Pork Grisking.</HI></P>
<P>They now promis'd if he would poi&s;on his Wife and give up his <HI>Grisking,</HI> that he &s;hould marry the rich <HI>Ben Meymon</HI>'s only Daughter. This made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on him.</P>
<P>They then talk'd to him in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue, which he not under&s;tanding, it was ob&s;erv'd had very great Weight with him.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44" MS="y">
They, now perceiving that his <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> was only <HI>Gain,</HI> de&s;i&s;ted from all other Arguments, and attack'd him on his weak &s;ide, namely that of <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which <HI>John Mendez</HI> offer'd him an Eighth of an advantagious Bargain for the <HI>A|po&s;tles Creed,</HI> which he readily and wickedly renounced.</P>
<P>He then &s;old the <HI>Nine and thirty Articles</HI> for a <HI>Bull;</HI> but in&s;i&s;ted hard upon <HI>Black-Pud|dings,</HI> being a great Lover thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;hua Parrara</HI> engag'd to let him &s;hare with him in his <HI>Bottomrye,</HI> upon this he was per&s;uaded out of his <HI>Chri&s;tian Name;</HI> but he &s;till adher'd to <HI>Black-Puddings.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Gideon Lopez</HI> tempted him with <HI>Forty Pound</HI> Sub&s;cription in <HI>Ram</HI>'s <HI>Bubble;</HI> for which he was content to give up the <HI>Four Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> and he was now compleated a perfect <HI>Jew,</HI> all but <HI>Black-Pudding</HI> and <HI>Cir|cumci&s;ion;</HI> for both of which he would have been glad to have had a Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>But on the 17th of <HI>March,</HI> Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> (un|known to his Wife) came to the Tavern a&s;ore|&s;aid. At his Entrance into the Room he per|ceived a meagre Man with a &s;allow Counte|nance, a black forky Beard, and long Ve&s;tment. In his Right Hand he held a large Pair of Sheers, and in his Left a red hot Searing-Iron. At Sight of this, Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Heart trembled within him, and feign would he retire; but he was prevented by &s;ix Jews, who laid Hands upon him, and unbuttoning his Breeches
<PB N="45" REF="45">
threw him upon the Table, a pale pitiful Spectacle.</P>
<P>He now intreated them in the mo&s;t moving Tone of Voice to di&s;pen&s;e with that <HI>unmanly</HI> Ceremonial, which if they would con&s;ent to, he faithfully promis'd that he would eat a Quarter of <HI>Pa&s;chal Lamb</HI> with them the next <HI>Sunday</HI> following.</P>

<HEAD>THE WONDERFUL WONDER of WONDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a certain Per&s;on lately arrived at this City, whom it is very proper the World &s;hould be informed of. His Character may, perhaps, be thought very Incon&s;i&s;tent, Improbable, and Unnatural; however I in|tend to draw it with the utmo&s;t Regard to Truth. This I am the better qualified to do, becau&s;e he is a &s;ort of <HI>Dependant</HI> upon our Family, and <HI>almo&s;t</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Age;</HI> tho' I cannot directly &s;ay, I have ever <HI>&s;ecn</HI> him. He is a Native of this Country, and hath lived long among us, but what appears wonderful, and hardly credible, was never &s;een <HI>before,</HI> by any Mortal.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, he always chu&s;es the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> Place in Company, and contrives it &s;o, to keep <HI>out of Sight.</HI> It is reported, however, that in his younger Days he was frequently <HI>expo&s;ed</HI> to <HI>View,</HI> but always again&s;t his Will, and was &s;ure to <HI>&s;mart</HI> for it.</P>
<P>As to his Family, he came into the World a Younger Brother, being of <HI>&s;ix</HI> Children, the
<PB N="52" REF="52">
<HI>fourth</HI> in order of (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N1">1</REF>) Birth; of which the elde&s;t is now <HI>Head</HI> of the Hou&s;e, the &s;econd and third carry <HI>Arms:</HI> but the two Younge&s;t are only <HI>Footmen:</HI> Some indeed, add, that he hath like|wi&s;e a Twin-Brother, who lives <HI>over-again&s;t</HI> him, and keeps a (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N2">2</REF>) <HI>Victualling-Hou&s;e:</HI> He has the Reputation to be a <HI>clo&s;e, griping, &s;queezing</HI> Fellow; and that when his Bags are <HI>full,</HI> he is often <HI>Needy;</HI> yet, when the Fit takes him, as fa&s;t as he gets, he <HI>lets it fly.</HI></P>
<P>When in <HI>Office,</HI> no one <HI>di&s;chargeth</HI> him&s;elf, or <HI>does his Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> better. He hath &s;ome|times <HI>&s;trained hard</HI> for an Hone&s;t Livelihood, and never got a <HI>Bit,</HI> till every Body el&s;e had <HI>done.</HI></P>
<P>One Practice appears very blameable in him, that every Morning he privately frequents <HI>unclean Hou&s;es,</HI> where any mode&s;t Per&s;on would blu&s;h to be &s;een. And altho' this be generally known, yet the World, as Cen&s;orious as it is, is &s;o kind to overlook this Infirmity in him. To deal Im|partially, it mu&s;t be granted, that he is too great a Lover of him&s;elf, and very often con&s;ults his own <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> at the Expence of his be&s;t Friends. But this is one of his <HI>blind-Sides;</HI> and the be&s;t of Men I fear are not without <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>He hath been con&s;tituted by the <HI>higher</HI> Pow|ers in the Station of <HI>Receiver-General,</HI> in which Employment &s;ome have cen&s;ured him for play|ing <HI>fa&s;t</HI> and <HI>loo&s;e.</HI> He is likewi&s;e <HI>Over&s;eer</HI> of the <HI>Golden Mines,</HI> which he daily in&s;pects when his Health will permit him.</P>
<P>He was long bred under a (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P52N3">3</REF>) <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts,</HI> who in&s;tilled good <HI>Principles</HI> in him, but the&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="53">
were &s;oon <HI>Corrupted.</HI> I know not whether this de&s;erves mention, that he is &s;o very Capricious, as to take it for an equal Affront to talk either of <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> or <HI>kicking</HI> him, which hath occa&s;ion'd a Thou&s;and Quarrels: However no body was ever &s;o great a Sufferer for Faults which he nei|ther was, nor po&s;&s;ibly could be guilty of.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Religion</HI> he has thus much of the Qua|ker, that he &s;tands <HI>always covered,</HI> even in the Pre&s;ence of the King; in mo&s;t other Points, a perfect (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P53N4">4</REF>) <HI>Idolater,</HI> altho' he endeavours to <HI>conceal</HI> it; for he is known to offer daily Sacri|fices to certain <HI>Subterraneous Nymphs,</HI> whom he wor&s;hips in an <HI>humble Po&s;ture, prone on his Face,</HI> and <HI>&s;tript &s;tark Naked,</HI> and &s;o leaves his <HI>Offerings behind him,</HI> which the (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P53N5">5</REF>) <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> of tho&s;e Godde&s;&s;es are careful enough to remove upon certain Sea&s;ons, with the utmo&s;t Privacy at <HI>Midnight,</HI> and from thence maintain'd them|&s;elves and Families. In all <HI>urgent Nece&s;&s;ities</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;&s;ures</HI> he applies him&s;elf to the&s;e Deities, and &s;ometimes even in the <HI>Streets</HI> and <HI>High-ways,</HI> from an <HI>Opinion</HI> that tho&s;e Powers have an In|fluence in all Places, altho' their peculiar Re&s;i|dence is in Caverns under Ground. Upon the&s;e <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> the faire&s;t Ladies will not refu&s;e to <HI>lend</HI> their <HI>Hands</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: For, altho' they are a&s;ham'd to have him <HI>&s;een</HI> in their Company, or even &s;o much as to hear him <HI>Named;</HI> yet it is well known, that he is one of their <HI>con&s;tant Followers.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Politicks,</HI> he always &s;ubmits to what is <HI>uppermo&s;t,</HI> but he peru&s;es Pamphlets <HI>on both</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="54">
<HI>Sides</HI> with great Impartiality, tho' &s;eldom till <HI>every Body el&s;e have done with them.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Learning</HI> is of a mixed kind, and he may properly be called a <HI>Helluo librorum,</HI> or another <HI>Jacobus de Voragine:</HI> tho' his Studies are chiefly confined to <HI>School-men, Commentators,</HI> and <HI>Ger|man Divines,</HI> together with <HI>Modern Poetry</HI> and <HI>Criticks:</HI> And he is an <HI>Atomick</HI> Philo&s;opher, &s;trongly maintaining a <HI>Void</HI> in <HI>Nature,</HI> which he &s;eems to have fairly proved by many <HI>Ex|periments.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to de&s;cribe &s;ome peculiar Qualities, which in &s;everal In&s;tances &s;eem to di&s;tingui&s;h this Per&s;on from the common Race of other Mortals.</P>
<P>His <HI>Grandfather</HI> was a Member of the <HI>Rump</HI> Parliament, as the <HI>Grand&s;on</HI> is of the <HI>Pre&s;ent,</HI> where he often <HI>ri&s;es,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>grumbles</HI> but never <HI>&s;peaks.</HI> However, he lets nothing pa&s;s <HI>willingly,</HI> but what is <HI>well dige&s;ted.</HI> His Cou|rage is indi&s;putable, for he will take the bolde&s;t Man alive <HI>by the No&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He is generally the <HI>fir&s;t a Bed</HI> in the Family, and the <HI>la&s;t up,</HI> which is to be lamented, becau&s;e when he happens to <HI>ri&s;e before</HI> the re&s;t, it hath been thought to forebode &s;ome <HI>good Fortune to his Superiors.</HI></P>
<P>As Wi&s;dom is acquired by Age, &s;o by every new (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P54N6">6</REF>) <HI>Wrinkle</HI> in his <HI>Face,</HI> he is reported to gain &s;ome <HI>new Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>In him we may ob&s;erve the true Effects and Con&s;equences of <HI>Tyranny</HI> in a State: For, as he is a great <HI>Oppre&s;&s;or</HI> of all <HI>below</HI> him, &s;o there is no Body more <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> by tho&s;e <HI>above</HI> him:

Yet in this Time, he hath been &s;o highly in Favour, that many <HI>Illu&s;trious Per&s;ons</HI> have been entirely indebted to <HI>him</HI> for their <HI>Prefer|ments.</HI></P>
<P>He hath di&s;covered from his own Experience the true <HI>Point</HI> wherein all human Actions, Pro|jects, and De&s;igns do chiefly <HI>terminate;</HI> and how <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>&s;ordid</HI> they are <HI>at the Bottom.</HI></P>
<P>It behoves the Publick to keep him <HI>quiet,</HI> for his <HI>frequent Murmurs</HI> are a certain Sign of <HI>inte&s;tine</HI> Tumults.</P>
<P>No Philo&s;opher ever lamented more the Lu|xury, for which the&s;e Nations are &s;o ju&s;tly taxed; it hath been known to co&s;t him (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P55N7">7</REF>) <HI>Tears of Blood:</HI> For in his own Nature he is far from being <HI>Profu&s;e,</HI> tho' indeed, he never &s;tays a Night at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e without <HI>leaving &s;omething behind him.</HI></P>
<P>He receives with g eat Submi&s;&s;ion whatever his Patrons think fit to give him; and when they lay <HI>heavy Burthens</HI> upon him, which is fre|quently enough, he gets rid of them as &s;oon as he can; but not without <HI>&s;ome Labour</HI> and <HI>much Grumbling.</HI></P>
<P>He is a perpetual <HI>Hanger-on;</HI> yet no Body knows how to be <HI>without him.</HI> He patiently fuffers him&s;elf to be <HI>kept under,</HI> but loves to be well u&s;ed, and in that Ca&s;e will &s;acrifice his <HI>Vitals</HI> to give you <HI>Ea&s;e;</HI> and he has hardly one Aquaintance for whom he hath not been <HI>Bound;</HI> yet, as far as we can find, was never known to <HI>lo&s;e</HI> any thing by it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="56">
He is ob&s;erv'd to be very (<REF TARGET="CT148130.P56N8">8</REF>) <HI>unquiet</HI> in the Company of a <HI>Frenchman</HI> in <HI>New Cloaths,</HI> or a young <HI>Coquett.</HI></P>

<P>He lets any Gentleman charge a Blunderbu&s;s, with the &s;ame Gunpowder, and twelve Leaden Bullets, which Blunderbu&s;s the &s;aid Arti&s;t di&s;|charges full in the Face of the &s;aid Company, without the lea&s;t hurt, the Bullets &s;ticking in the Wall behind them.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60">
He takes any Gentleman's own Sword, and runs it through the &s;aid Gentleman's Body, &s;o that the Point appears bloody at the back, to all the Spectators; then he takes out the Sword, wipes it clean, and returns it to the owner, who receives no manner of hurt.</P>
<P>He takes a Pot of Scalding Oyl, and throws it by great Ladles full directly at the Ladies, without &s;poiling their Cloaths or burning their Skins.</P>
<P>He takes any Per&s;on of Quality's Child from two Years Old to &s;ix, and lets the Child's own Father or Mother take a Pike in their Hands; then the Arti&s;t takes the Child in his Arms and to&s;&s;es it upon the Point of the Pike, where it &s;ticks to the great Satisfaction of all Spectators; and is then taken off without &s;o much as a hole in his Coat.</P>
<P>He mounts upon a Scaffold ju&s;t over the Spe|ctators, and from thence throws down a great Quantity of large Tiles and Stones, which fall like &s;o many Pillows, without &s;o much as di&s;|compo&s;ing either Perukes or Head-dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He takes any Per&s;on of Quality up to the &s;aid Scaffold, which Per&s;on pulls off his Shoes, and leaps nine Foot directly down on a Board prepar'd on Purpo&s;e full of &s;harp Spikes &s;ix Inches long, without hurting his Feet or Damaging his Stockings.</P>
<P>He places the &s;aid Board on a Chair, upon which a Lady &s;its down with another Lady in her Lap, while the Spikes in&s;tead of entring into the under Lady's fle&s;h, will feel like a Velvet Cu&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61">
He takes any Per&s;on of Quality's Footman, tyes a Rope about his bare Neck, and draws him up by Pullies to the Cieling, and the&s;e keeps him hanging as long as his Ma&s;ter or the Com|pany plea&s;es, the &s;aid Footman to the Wonder and Delight of all Beholders, with a Pot of Ale in one Hand and a Pipe in the other; and when he is let down, there will not appear the lea&s;t Mark of the Cord about his Neck.</P>
<P>He bids a Lady's Maid put her finger into a Cup of clear Liquor like Water, upon which her Face and both her Hands are immediately wither'd, like an Old Woman of four&s;core, her Belly &s;wells as if &s;he were in a Week of her Time, and her Legs are as thick as Mill-Po&s;ts; but upon putting her finger into another Cup, &s;he becomes as Young and Hand&s;ome as &s;he was before.</P>
<P>He gives any Gentleman leave to drive forty Twelve-penny Nails up to the Head in a Por|ter's back&s;ide, and then places the &s;aid Porter on a Load&s;tone Chair, which draws out every Nail, and the Porter feels no Pain.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e draws the Teeth of half a Dozen Gentlemen, mixes and jumbles them in a Hat, gives any Per&s;on leave to blindfold him, and raturns each their own, and fixes them as well as ever.</P>
<P>With his Fore-finger and Thumb he thru&s;ts &s;everal Gentlemen's and Lady's Eyes out of their Heads, without the lea&s;t Pain, at which time they &s;ee an un&s;peakable Number of beauti|ful Colours, and after they are entertain'd to the
<PB N="62" REF="62">
full, he places them again in their proper Sockets, without any Damage to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>He lets any Gentleman drink a Quart of hot melted Lead, and by a Draught of prepared Liquor, of which he takes part him&s;elf, he makes the &s;aid Lead pa&s;s through the &s;aid Gen|tleman before all the Spectators, without any Damage: After which it is produced in a Cake to the Company.</P>
<P>With many other Wonderful Performances of Art, too tedious here to mention.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Arti&s;t has perform'd before mo&s;t Kings and Princes in <HI>Europe</HI> with great Ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>He Performs every Day (except <HI>Sundays</HI>) from Ten of the Clock to One in the Forenoon; and from Four till Seven in the Evening, at the New Inn in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Seat a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, the &s;econd a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Half-Crown, and the lowe&s;t a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Shilling.</P>

<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THAT whereas certain <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> Di&s;affe|cted to the Government, and to the Trade and Pro&s;perity of this Kingdom, taking upon them the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS, have pre|&s;umed, by Gathering, Breaking, Folding, and Bundling-up the <HI>Sun-Beams,</HI> by the help of cer|tain <HI>Gla&s;&s;es,</HI> to Make, Produce, and Kindle up &s;everal New <HI>Focus</HI>'s or Fires within the&s;e His Maje&s;ty's Dominions, and thereby to Boil, Bake, Stew, Fry and Dre&s;s all &s;orts of Victuals and Provi&s;ions, to Brew, Di&s;til Spirits, Smelt Oar, and in general, to perform all the Offices of Cu|linary Fires; and are endeavouring to procure

to them&s;elves the Monopoly of this their &s;aid Invention. We beg leave humbly to repre&s;ent to your Honours.</P>
<P>That &s;uch Grant or Patent will utterly Ruin and reduce to Beggery your Petitioners, their Wives, Children, Servants, and Trades on them depending; there being nothing left to them, after the &s;aid Invention, but Warming of Cellars and Dre&s;&s;ing of Suppers in the Win|ter-time. That the aboli&s;hing &s;o con&s;iderable a Branch of the Coa&s;ting Trade as that of the Colliers, will de&s;troy the <HI>Navigation</HI> of this Kingdom. That whereas the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> talk of making u&s;e of the <HI>Moon</HI> by Night, as of the <HI>Sun</HI> by Day, they will utterly ruin the numerous Body of <HI>Tallow-Chandlers,</HI> and impair a very con&s;iderable branch of the <HI>Revenue</HI> which ari&s;es from the <HI>Tax</HI> upon Tal|low and Candles.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> do pro|fane the Emanations of that Glorious Luminary the <HI>Sun,</HI> which is appointed to <HI>Rule the Day,</HI> and not to <HI>Roa&s;t Mutton.</HI> And we humbly conceive, it will be found contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom, to Confine, Fore&s;tall, and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun.

<P>That the Diver&s;ity of Expo&s;ition of the &s;everal Kitchens in this great City, whereby

<P>That it is known by Experience, That Meat Roa&s;ted with Sun-Beams is extreamly unwhole|&s;ome; witne&s;s &s;everal that have dy'd &s;uddenly after eating the Provi&s;ions of the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers;</HI> fora&s;much as the Sun-Beams taken

<P>That Sun-beams taken <HI>inwardly,</HI> &s;hed a Ma|lignant Influence upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> by their na|tural Tendency towards the <HI>Moon;</HI> and produce Madne&s;s and Di&s;traction at the time of the Full Moon.

<P>That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other Parts of Plants, the&s;e being impregna|ted with the Sun-Beams, may <HI>vegetate</HI> and <HI>grow</HI> in the Bowels, a Thing of more dangerous Con|&s;equence to human Bodies than Breeding of Worms; and this will fall heavie&s;t upon the Poor, who live upon Roots; and the Weak and Sickly, who live upon Barley and Rice-Gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which we are ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Phy&s;icians, That the Ta&s;te and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the wor&s;e by the &s;aid <HI>Solar Coo|kery,</HI> the Frica&s;&s;es being depriv'd of the <HI>Haut Gout</HI> they acquire by being dre&s;s'd over Char|coal.</P>

<HEAD>REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company exerci&s;ing the Trade and Mi&s;tery of UPHOL|DERS, again&s;t Part of the BILL, <HI>For the better Viewing, Searching and Examining Drugs, Medicines,</HI> &amp;c. 1724.</HEAD>
<P>BEING call'd upon by &s;everal Retailers and Di&s;pen&s;ers of <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Medicines</HI> about Town, to u&s;e our Endeavours a|gain&s;t the Bill now depending, <HI>for Viewing,</HI> &amp;c. In regard of our common Intere&s;t, and in Gra|titude to the &s;aid Retailers and Di&s;pen&s;ers of Medicines (which we have always found to be very effectual) we pre&s;ume to lay the following Rea&s;ons before the Publick, again&s;t the &s;aid Bill.</P>
<P>That the Company of Upholders <HI>are far from being aver&s;e to the giving of Drugs and Me|dicines in general,</HI> provided they may be of &s;uch Qualities as we require, and admini&s;ter'd by
<PB N="69" REF="69">
&s;uch Per&s;ons in whom our Company ju&s;tly repo&s;e the greate&s;t Confidence: And provided they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and the Con|&s;umption of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that <HI>there hath been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gentry and Citizens whom we have attended.</HI> Our Practice, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in outward Applications, having been always &s;o effectual, that none of our Patients have been oblig'd to undergo a &s;e|cond Operation. Excepting one Gentlewoman; who, after her fir&s;t Burial, having burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of po&s;thumous Chil|dren, her &s;econd Funeral was by us perform'd without any farther Charges to the &s;aid Husband of the deceas'd. And we humbly hope, that one &s;ingle In&s;tance of this Kind (a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be imputed to any Want of Skill, or Care, in our Company.</P>
<P>We humbly conceive, that the <HI>Power by this Bill lodged in the Cen&s;ors of the College of Phy&s;i|cians,</HI> to re&s;train any of His Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects from di&s;pen&s;ing, and well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons from taking what Medicines they plea&s;e, <HI>is a manife&s;t Encroachment on the Liberty and Proper|ty of the Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>As the Company exerci&s;ing the Trade and Mi&s;tery of Upholders, have an undi&s;puted Right in and upon the <HI>Bodies</HI> of all and every the Sub|jects of the Kingdom; we conceive the pa&s;&s;ing of this Bill, though not ab&s;olutely depriving them of their &s;aid Right, might keep them <HI>out</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="70">
<HI>of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> by unrea&s;onable <HI>Delays,</HI> to the great Detriment of our Company and their numerous Families.</P>
<P>We hope it will be con&s;ider'd that there are Multitudes of nece&s;&s;itous Heirs and penurious Parents, Per&s;ons in pinching Circum&s;tances, with numerous Families of Children, Wives that have lived long, many robu&s;t aged Women with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad Under&s;tandings, &s;ingle Heirs of great E&s;tates, whereby the Collateral Line are for ever ex|cluded, Rever&s;ionary Patents, and Rever&s;ionary Promi&s;es of Preferments, Lea&s;es upon Single Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and that the Per&s;ons &s;o aggrieved have no Hope of being &s;peedily relieved any other Way, than by the di&s;pen&s;ing of <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Medicines</HI> in the Manner they <HI>now are;</HI> Burying <HI>alive</HI> being judg'd re|pugnant to the known Laws of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>That there are many of the Decea&s;ed, who by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are carried about Town, who would have been put into our Hands long before this Time by any other well-order'd Government; By want of a due <HI>Police</HI> in this Particular, our Company have been great Sufferers.</P>
<P>That <HI>frequent Funerals</HI> contribute to pre&s;erve the Genealogies of Families and the Honours conferred by the Crown, (which are no where &s;o well illu&s;trated as on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion;) to maintain <HI>nece&s;&s;itous Clergy,</HI> to enable the <HI>Clerks</HI> to appear in decent Habits to officiate on <HI>Sundays,</HI> to feed the great Retinue of <HI>&s;ober</HI> and <HI>melancholy Men</HI> who appear at the &s;aid Funerals, and who
<PB N="71" REF="71">
mu&s;t &s;tarve without con&s;tant and regular Em|ployment. Moreover we de&s;ire it may be re|member'd that by the pa&s;&s;ing of this Bill the No|bility and Gentry will have their <HI>old Coaches</HI> lie upon their Hands, which are now employed by our Company.</P>
<P>And we further hope that frequent Funerals will not be di&s;couraged (as is by this Bill pro|po&s;ed) it being the only Method left of <HI>carrying</HI> &s;ome People to <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>We are afraid that by the Hard&s;hips of this Bill our Company will be reduced to leave their Bu&s;ine&s;s here, and <HI>practi&s;e at</HI> York <HI>and</HI> Bri&s;tol, <HI>where the free U&s;e of bad Medicines will be &s;till allowed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is therefore hoped that no &s;pecious Pretence what&s;oever will be thought &s;ufficient to introduce an Arbitrary and Unlimited Power for Peope to live</HI> (in Defiance of <HI>Art</HI>) as long as they can by the Cour&s;e of <HI>Nature,</HI> to the Prejudice of our Com|pany, and the Decay of Trade.</P>
<P>That as our Company are like to &s;uffer in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the Power given to Phy&s;i|cians to di&s;&s;ect the Bodies of Malefactors, we humbly hope that the Manufacture of Ca&s;es for Skeletons will be re&s;erved &s;olely to the Coffin|makers.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e humbly pre&s;ume that the Inte|re&s;ts of the &s;everal Trades and Pro&s;e&s;&s;ions which depend upon ours, may be regarded; &s;uch as that of Hear&s;es, Coaches, Coffins, Epitaphs, and Bell-ropes, Stone-cutters, Feather-men and Bell|ringers; and e&s;pecially the Manu&s;acturers of Crapes; and the Makers <HI>of Snuff,</HI> who u&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="72">
great Quantities of old Coffins, and who, con|&s;ider'd in the Con&s;umption of their Drugs, em|ploy by far the greate&s;t Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the Kingdom.</P>

<P>I SUPPOSE every Body is &s;ufficiently ap|priz'd of, and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the 29th of this In&s;tant <HI>December,</HI> 1722, foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity, under the Name of the <HI>Annus Mirabilis,</HI> or the <HI>Metamorpho&s;tical</HI> Con|junction; a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes, (the Effect of that Configuration of the Cele&s;tial Bodies) the human Males being to be turn'd into Females, and the human Females into Males.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74">
The <HI>Egyptians</HI> have repre&s;ented this great Transformation by &s;everal &s;ignificant Hierogly|phicks, particularly one very remarkable. There are carv'd upon an Obelisk, a <HI>Barber</HI> and a <HI>Midwife;</HI> the Barber delivers his <HI>Ra|zor</HI> to the Midwife, and &s;he her <HI>Swadling Cloaths</HI> to the Barber. Accordingly <HI>Thales Mile&s;ius</HI> (who, like the re&s;t of his Countrymen, borrow'd his Learning from the <HI>Egyptians</HI>) af|ter having computed the Time of this famous Conjunction, <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall Men and Wo|men mutually exchange the Pangs of</HI> Shaving <HI>and</HI> Child-bearing.</P>
<P><HI>Anaximander</HI> mode&s;tly de&s;cribes this Meta|morpho&s;is in mathematical Terms: <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall the negative Quantity of the Women be turn'd into po&s;itive, their <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> into</HI> &cross;; (i. e.) their <HI>Minus</HI> into <HI>Plus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> not only &s;peaks of this great Change, but de&s;cribes all the Preparations towards it. <Q REND="inline">"Long before the bodily Transformation (&s;ays he) Nature &s;hall begin the mo&s;t difficult Part of her Work, by changing the <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Inclinations</HI> of the two Sexes: Men &s;hall turn effeminate, and Women manly; Wives &s;hall domineer, and Husbands obey; Ladies &s;hall <HI>ride a Hor&s;eback,</HI> dre&s;s'd like <HI>Cavaliers;</HI> Princes and Nobles appear in <HI>Night-rails</HI> and <HI>Petticoats;</HI> Men &s;hall <HI>&s;queak</HI> upon Theatres with <HI>Female</HI> Voices, and Women <HI>corrupt Virgins;</HI> Men &s;hall <HI>knot</HI> and <HI>cut Paper;</HI> and even the <HI>Northern</HI> People, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">: A Phra&s;e (which for Mode&s;ty's Sake
<PB N="75" REF="75">
I forbear to tran&s;late) which denotes a Vice too frequent among&s;t us."</Q> So far <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>That the Mini&s;try fore&s;aw this great Change, is plain from the Callico-Act; whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Women all over <HI>England,</HI> to convert their u&s;ele&s;s Female Habits into Beds, Window-Curtains, Chairs, and Joint-&s;tools; <HI>undre&s;&s;ing</HI> them&s;elves (as it were) <HI>before their Transformation.</HI></P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophy of this Transformation will not &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing to People, who &s;earch into the <HI>Bottom</HI> of Things. Madam <HI>Bourignon,</HI> a devout <HI>French</HI> Lady, has &s;hewn us, how Man was at fir&s;t created Male and Female in one In|dividual, having the Faculty of Propagation with|in him&s;elf: A Circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to the State of Innocence, wherein a Man's Happine&s;s was not to depend upon the Caprice of another. It was not till after he had made a <HI>&s;aux pas,</HI> that he had his Female Mate. Many &s;uch Trans|formations of Individuals have been well atte&s;ted; particularly one by <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and another by the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> From all which it appears, that this Sy&s;tem of Male and Female has already undergone, and may hereafter &s;uffer &s;everal Alterations. Every Smatterer in Anato|my knows, that a Woman is but an introverted Man; a new Fu&s;ion and <HI>Flatus</HI> will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity; but I forbear, (for the Sake of my <HI>Mode&s;t Men Rea|ders,</HI> who are in a few Days to be Virgins.)</P>
<P>In &s;ome Subjects, the &s;malle&s;t Alterations will do: &s;ome Men are &s;ufficiently &s;pread about the Hips, and contriv'd with that Female Softne&s;s,
<PB N="76" REF="76">
that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxom Wenches; and there are Women who are, as it were, already the <HI>Ebauche</HI> of a good &s;turdy Man. If Nature cou'd be puz|zl'd, it will be how to be&s;tow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now ap|pear about Town, or how to roll out the &s;hort dapper Fellows into well-&s;iz'd Women.</P>
<P>This great Conjunction will begin to operate on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 29th In&s;tant. Accordingly, a|bout Eight at Night, as <HI>Senezino</HI> &s;hall begin at the Opera, <HI>Si videte, Did you but &s;ee?</HI> He &s;hall be ob&s;erved to make an <HI>unu&s;ual Motion;</HI> upon which the Audience will be affected with a <HI>red Suffu&s;ion</HI> over their Countenance: And becau&s;e a &s;trong Succe&s;&s;ion of the Mu&s;cles of the Belly is nece&s;&s;ary towards performing this great Ope|ration, both Sexes will be thrown into a <HI>profu&s;e involuntary Laughter;</HI> Then (to u&s;e the mode&s;t Terms of <HI>Anaximander</HI>) <HI>&s;hall negative Quantity be turn'd into po&s;itive,</HI> &amp;c. Time never beheld, nor will it ever a&s;&s;emble, &s;uch a Number of <HI>un|touch'd Virgins</HI> within tho&s;e Walls! but alas! &s;uch will be the Impatience and Curio&s;ity of People to act in their new Capacity, that many of them will go to pot that <HI>very Night.</HI> To prevent the Di&s;orders that may happen upon this Occa&s;ion, is the chief De&s;ign of this Paper.</P>
<P>Gentlemen have begun already to make u&s;e of this Conjunction to Compa&s;s their filthy Pur|po&s;es. They tell the Ladies for&s;ooth, that it is only parting with a peri&s;hable Commodity; hard|ly of &s;o much Value as a Callico Under-petti|coat,
<PB N="77" REF="77">
&s;ince, like its Mi&s;tre&s;s, it will be u&s;ele&s;s in the Form it is now in. If the Ladies have no Regard to the Di&s;honour and Immorality of the Action, I de&s;ire they will con&s;ider that Nature, who never de&s;troys her own Productions, will exempt big-belly'd Women till the time of their Lying-in; &s;o that not to be transform'd, will be the &s;ame as to be pregnant. If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortre&s;s that is to be demoli&s;h'd in a few Days, let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing Nine Months hence, to be brought to Bed of a Ba&s;tard; a po&s;thumous Ba&s;tard as it were, to which the <HI>Quondam</HI> Father can be no more than a <HI>dry Nur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This wonderful Transformation is the In&s;tru|ment of Nature, to balance Matters between the Sexes. The Cruelty of &s;cornful Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;hall be return'd; The &s;lighted Maid &s;hall grow into an imperious Gallant, and reward her Undoer with a big Belly, and a Ba&s;tard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occa&s;ion over the Face of the Earth. I long impatiently to &s;ee the Proceedings of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the Title of Succe&s;&s;ion to their Crown; this be|ing a Ca&s;e not provided for by the <HI>Salique</HI> Law. There will be no preventing Di&s;orders among&s;t Friars and Monks; for certainly Vows of Cha|&s;tity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made. The &s;ame will hold good with Mar|riages, tho' I think it will be a Scandal among&s;t Prote&s;tants for Husbands and Wives to part, &s;ince there remains &s;till a po&s;&s;ibility to perform the <HI>De|bitum</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="78">

<P>The Pope mu&s;t undergo a new groping; but the fal&s;e Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> has contriv'd Matters well for his Succe&s;&s;ors; for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women, he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;urprizing Scenes, but I beg leave to affirm, that the &s;olemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation, not of Ridicule; there|fore I make it my earne&s;t Reque&s;t to the merry Fellows, and giggling Girls about Town, that they would not put them&s;elves in a high Twitter, when they go to vi&s;it a <HI>General</HI> Lying in of his fir&s;t Child; his <HI>Officers</HI> &s;erving as Midwifes, Nur|&s;es and Rockers di&s;pen&s;ing Caudle; or if they be|hold the <HI>Reverend Prelates</HI> dre&s;&s;ing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court, I beg they will re|member that the&s;e Offices mu&s;t be fill'd with Peo|ple of the greate&s;t Regularity, and be&s;t Characters.

<P>I cannot but congratulate human Nature, up|on this happy Transformation; the only Expedi|ent left to re&s;tore the Liberties and Tranquility of Mankind; which is &s;o evident, that it is al|mo&s;t an Affront to common Sen&s;e to in&s;i&s;t upon the Proof of it. If there can be any &s;uch &s;tupid Creature who doubts it, I de&s;ire he will make but the following obvious Reflection: There are in <HI>Europe</HI> alone, at pre&s;ent, about a Million of &s;turdy Fellows, under the Denomination of <HI>&s;tan|ding Forces,</HI> with Arms in their Hands: That tho&s;e are Ma&s;ters of the Lives, Liberties and For|tunes of all the re&s;t, I believe no body will deny. It is no le&s;s true in Fact, that Reams of Paper, and above a &s;quare Mile of Skins of Vel|lum have been employ'd to no Purpo&s;e, to &s;ettle Peace among&s;t tho&s;e Sons of Violence. Pray, who is he that will &s;ay unto them, <HI>Go and di&s;|band your &s;elves?</HI> But lo! by this Transformation it is done at once, and the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Days of pub|lick Tranquility return. For neither the Military Temper nor Dicipline can taint the &s;oft Sex for a

whole Age to come. <HI>Bellaque matribus invi&s;a' Wars odious now to Mothers,</HI> will not grow immediately palatable in their <HI>Paternal</HI> State.</P>
<P>Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be le&s;s in <HI>Family</HI>-Tranquility, than it is in <HI>Natio|nal.</HI> Great Faults will be amended, and Frailties forgiven, on both Sides. A Wife who has been di&s;turb'd with late Hours, and choak'd with the Haugo&ucirc;t of a Sot, will remember her Sufferings, and avoid the Temptation; and will, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, indulge her Mate in his Female Capacity in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;he is &s;en&s;ible from Expe|rience are natural to the Sex.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY Of the Learned MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS, Concerning the ORIGINE of SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written to the mo&s;t Learned <HI>Dr.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> F. R. S. from the <HI>De&s;erts</HI> of <HI>NUBIA.D</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the Enquiries which have been pur&s;u'd by the Curious and In|qui&s;itive, there is none more worthy the &s;earch of a Learned Head, than the Source from whence we derive tho&s;e Arts and Sciences which rai&s;e us &s;o far above the Vulgar, the Countries in which they ro&s;e, and the Channels by which they have been convey'd. As they who fir&s;t brought them among&s;t us travell'd into the remo|te&s;t Parts of the Earth to attain them, I may

boa&s;t of &s;ome advantages by the &s;ame means; &s;ince I write this from the De&s;erts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> from tho&s;e Plains of Sand which have buried the Pride of Invading Armies, with my Foot perhaps at this in&s;tant ten Fathom over the Grave of <HI>Camby&s;es,</HI> a Solitude to which neither <HI>Pythagoras</HI> nor <HI>Apollonius</HI> ever penetrated.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally agreed, that Arts and Sciences took their Ri&s;e among the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> but from whom <HI>they</HI> fir&s;t receiv'd them, is yet a Secret. The highe&s;t Period of Time to which the Learned attempt to trace them, is from the be|ginning of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian Monarchy,</HI> when their In|ventors were wor&s;hip'd as Gods. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to go backward into Times even more remote, and to gain &s;ome knowledge of their Hi|&s;tory, from whatever dark and broken Hints may any way be found in ancient Authors con|cerning them.</P>
<P>Nor <HI>Troy</HI> nor <HI>Thebes</HI> were the fir&s;t of Empires; we have mention, tho' not Hi&s;tories, of an earlier warlike People call'd the <HI>Pygmaeans.</HI> I cannot but per&s;wade my &s;elf, from tho&s;e Accounts of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Il.</HI> 3. Hom.</NOTE> <HI>Ho|mer, Ari&s;totle</HI> and others, that their Hi&s;tory, Wars, and Revolutions were then a part of the Study of the Learned, from the very Air in which tho&s;e Authors &s;peak of them, as of things univer&s;ally known. And tho' all we directly hear is of their Military Atchievements, in the brave defence of their Country from the annual Inva&s;ions of a Powerful Enemy, yet I cannot
<PB N="85" REF="85">
doubt but that they excell'd as much in the Arts of peaceful Government, tho' there remain no Traces of their Civil In&s;titutions. Empires as great have been &s;wallow'd up in the wreck of Time, and &s;uch certain Periods have been put to them, as occa&s;ion a Total Ignorance of their Story. And if I &s;hould conjecture that the like happen'd to this Nation, from a general extirpa|tion of the People by tho&s;e Flocks of Mon&s;trous Birds, wherewith Antiquity agrees they were con|tinually infe&s;ted; it ought not to &s;eem more in|credible, than that one of the <HI>Baleares</HI> was wa&s;ted by Rabbits, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;tathius in Hom. <HI>II.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Smynthe</HI> by Mice, and of late <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Speede, in <HI>Bermudas.</HI></NOTE><HI>Ber|mudas</HI> almo&s;t depopulated by Rats. Nothing is more natural to imagine, than that the few &s;ur|vivers of that Empire retired into the depths of their De&s;erts, where they liv'd undi&s;turb'd, 'till they were found out by <HI>O&s;yris</HI> in his Travels to in&s;truct Mankind.</P>
<P>He met, &s;ays <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">L. 1. ch. 18. Diod.</NOTE><HI>Diodorus,</HI> in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>little Satyrs,</HI> who were <HI>hairy one half of their Body,</HI> and who&s;e leader <HI>Pan</HI> accompany'd him in his Expedition for the civilizing of Mankind. Now of this great Per&s;onage <HI>Pan,</HI> we have a very particular De&s;cription in the ancient Writers, who unanimou&s;ly agree to repre&s;ent him, <HI>&s;haggy Bearded, Hairy all over, half a Man,</HI> and <HI>half a Bea&s;t,</HI> and walking <HI>erect,</HI> with a <HI>Staff,</HI> (the Po&s;ture in which his race are to this Day &s;hown among us). And &s;ince the chief thing to which he apply'd him&s;elf was the <HI>civilizing of Mankind,</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem that the fir&s;t Principles of Science

<P>If from <HI>Aegypt</HI> we proceed to take a View of <HI>India,</HI> we &s;hall find that their knowledge al&s;o de|riv'd it&s;elf from the &s;ame Source. To that Coun|try did the&s;e Noble Creatures accompany <HI>Bac|chus</HI> in his Expedition, under the Conduct of <HI>Si|lenus,</HI> who is al&s;o de&s;crib'd to us with the very &s;ame Marks and Qualifications.

They are &s;aid to <HI>dwell in the thicke&s;t Woods,</HI> to <HI>go na|ked,</HI> to &s;uffer their Bodies to be <HI>over-run with Hair,</HI> and their <HI>Nails</HI> to grow to a <HI>prodigious length.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his fir&s;t Orat. on <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Fortune.</NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, they eat what they could

<P>Hence we &s;ee that the two Nations which contend for the Origine of Learning, are the &s;ame that have ever mo&s;t abounded with this in|genious Race. Tho' they have conte&s;ted which was fir&s;t ble&s;t with the ri&s;e of Science, yet have they con&s;pir'd in being grateful to their common Ma&s;ters. <HI>Aegypt</HI> is well known to have wor|&s;hipp'd them of old in their <HI>own Images:</HI> and <HI>India</HI> may be credibly &s;uppos'd to have done the &s;ame, from that adoration which they paid in latter times to the <HI>Tooth</HI> of one of the&s;e hairy Philo&s;ophers, as it &s;hould &s;eem in ju&s;t Gratitude to the <HI>Mouth</HI> from which they receiv'd their Knowledge.</P>
<P>Pa&s;s we now over into <HI>Greece,</HI> where we find <HI>Orpheus</HI> returning out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> with the &s;ame intent as <HI>O&s;yris</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> made their Expedi|tions. From this period it was, that <HI>Greece</HI> fir&s;t heard the Name of <HI>Satyrs,</HI> or own'd them for <HI>Semi-dei.</HI> And hence it is &s;urely rea&s;onable to conclude, that he brought &s;ome of this wonderful Species along with him, who al&s;o had a leader of the line of <HI>Pan,</HI> of the &s;ame Name, and expre&s;sly call'd <HI>King</HI> by <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, Theo. Id. 1<HI>&s;t.</HI></NOTE><HI>Theocritus.</HI> If thus much be al|low'd, we ea&s;ily account for two of the &s;trange&s;t reports in all Antiquity. One, that the Tradi|tion of <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> following the Mu&s;ick of <HI>Orpheus</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="88">
(which has been interpreted of his taming Savage Tempers) will thus have a <HI>literal Application.</HI> The other, which we mo&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon, is, that the Love which the&s;e Sages bear to the Females of our Kind affords a Solution of all tho&s;e Fables of the <HI>Gods compre&s;&s;ing Women</HI> in Woods under <HI>be|&s;tial appearances.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible it may be obje|cted, that they are &s;aid to have been compre&s;s'd in the Shape of different Animals; but to this we an&s;wer, that Women under &s;uch apprehen|&s;ions hardly know what &s;hape they have to deal with.</P>
<P>From what has been la&s;t &s;aid, 'tis highly cre|dible that to this ancient and generous Race the World is indebted, if not for the <HI>Heroes,</HI> at lea&s;t for the acute&s;t <HI>Wits</HI> of Antiquity. One of the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tances, is that great mimick Genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vit. Ae&s;op. initio.</NOTE><HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> for who&s;e extraction from the&s;e <HI>Sylve&s;tres Homines</HI> we may gather an Argument from <HI>Planudes,</HI> who &s;ays, that <HI>Ae&s;op</HI> &s;ignifies the &s;ame thing as <HI>Aethiop,</HI> the Original Nation of our People. For a &s;econd Argument we may offer the de&s;cription of his Per&s;on, which was <HI>&s;hort, deform'd,</HI> and almo&s;t <HI>Savage,</HI> in&s;omuch that he might have liv'd in the Woods, had not the benevolence of his Temper made him rather adapt him&s;elf to our Manners, and come to Court in wearing Apparel. The third Proof is his a|cute and &s;atyrical Wit; and la&s;tly, his great Knowledge in the <HI>Nature of Bea&s;ts,</HI> together with the natural Plea&s;ure he took to &s;peak of them upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="89">
The next in&s;tance I &s;hall produce is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Xenophon.</HI></NOTE><HI>Socrates.</HI> Fir&s;t, it was a Tradition that he was of an un|common Birth from the re&s;t of Men; Secondly, he had a Countenance confe&s;&s;ing the Line he &s;prung from, being <HI>bald, flat-nos'd,</HI> with <HI>promi|nent Eyes,</HI> and a <HI>downward look:</HI> Thirdly, he turn'd certain Fables of Ae&s;op into Ver&s;e, proba|bly out of his re&s;pect to Bea&s;ts in general, and love to his Family in particular.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, the Women, with whom the&s;e Sylvans would have lovingly cohabited, were either taught by Mankind, or induc'd by an abhorrence of their Shapes, to &s;hun their em|braces; &s;o that our Sages were nece&s;&s;itated to mix with Bea&s;ts; This by degrees occa&s;ion'd the Hair of their Po&s;terity to grow higher than their Mid|dles; It aro&s;e in one Generation to their Arms, in the Second it invaded their Necks, in the Third it gain'd the a&s;cendant of their Heads, 'till the degenerate Appearance in which the Species is now immers'd, became compleated. Tho' we mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that there were a few who fell not under the common Calamity, there being &s;ome unprejudic'd Women in every Age, by vir|tue of whom a Total extinction of the Original Race was prevented: And it is remarkable al&s;o, that even where they were mix'd, the Defection from their Nature was not intire; there &s;till ap|pear'd marvellous Qualities among them, as was mani&s;e&s;t in tho&s;e who follow'd <HI>Alexander</HI> in <HI>In|dia.</HI> How did they attend his Army and &s;urvey his Order!

<P>To proceed to <HI>Italy:</HI> At the fir&s;t Appearance of the&s;e wild Philo&s;ophers, there were &s;ome of the lea&s;t mix'd, who vouch&s;afed to conver&s;e with Mankind; which is evident from the Name of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy.</NOTE><HI>Fauns,</HI> a <HI>fando,</HI> or <HI>&s;peaking.</HI> Such was he who coming out of the Woods, in hatred to Tyran|ny, encourag'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Army to proceed a|gain&s;t the <HI>Hetru&s;cans</HI> who would have re&s;tor'd <HI>Tarquin.</HI> But here, as in all the We&s;tern Parts of the World, there was a great and memorable <HI>Aera</HI> in which they began to be <HI>Silent.</HI> This we may place &s;omething near the time of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> when the Number, Vanity and Folly of Human Philo&s;ophers encreas'd, by which Men's Heads became too much puzzled to receive the Wi&s;dom of the&s;e ancient Sylvans; the Que&s;tions of that Academy were too numerous to be con&s;i&s;tent with their ea&s;e to an&s;wer; and too intricate, ex|travagant, idle, or pernicious, to be any other than a deri&s;ion and &s;corn unto them. From this Period, if ever we hear of their giving An&s;wers, it is only when <HI>caught, bound,</HI> and <HI>con&s;train'd,</HI> in like manner as was that Ancient <HI>Grecian</HI> Pro|phet, <HI>Proteus.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly we read in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plutarch in Vit. Sylla.</NOTE><HI>Sylla</HI>'s Time, of &s;uch a Philo&s;opher taken near <HI>Dyrrachium,</HI> who wou'd not be per&s;uaded to give them a Lecture by all

they cou'd &s;ay to him, and only &s;hew'd his Pow|er in <HI>Sounds</HI> by Neighing like a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>But a more &s;ucce&s;sful attempt was made in <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>'s reign by the Inqui&s;itive Genius of the great <HI>Virgil,</HI> whom, together with <HI>Varus,</HI> the Commentators &s;uppo&s;e to have been the true Per|&s;ons, who are related in the 6th Bucolick to have caught a Philo&s;opher, and doubtle&s;s a genuine one, of the Race of the old <HI>Silenus.</HI> To prevail upon him to be communicative (of the impor|tance of which <HI>Virgil</HI> was well aware) they not only ty'd him fa&s;t, but allur'd him likewi&s;e by making him a pre&s;ent of a comely Maiden call'd <HI>Aegle,</HI> which made him &s;ing both merrily and in|&s;tructively. In this Song we have their <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Creation,</HI> the &s;ame in all probability as was taught &s;o many Ages before in the great <HI>Pyg|maean</HI> Empire, and &s;everal Hieroglyphical Fables under which they couch'd or embelli&s;h'd their Morals. For which rea&s;on I look upon this Bu|colick as an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure of the mo&s;t an|cient Science.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> we hear of ano|ther, taken in a Net, and brought to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> round whom the People flock'd to hear his Wi&s;|dom; but as <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> reporteth, he prov'd a dumb Philo&s;opher, and only in&s;tructed by <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t we &s;hall &s;peak of who &s;eemeth to be of the true Race, is &s;aid by St. <HI>Jerome</HI> to have met St. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vit. St. Ant.</NOTE> <HI>Anthony</HI> in a De&s;ert, who enquir|ing the Way of him, he &s;hew'd his under|&s;tanding,

and Courte&s;y by pointing, but wou'd not an&s;wer, for he was a dumb Philo&s;opher al&s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the Notices which I am at pre|&s;ent able to gather of the appearance of &s;o great and learned a People in <HI>your &s;ide</HI> of the World. But if we return to their ancient native Seats, <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> we &s;hall there find even in mo|dern times, the Traces of their Original Conduct and Valour.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa</HI> (as we read among the indefatigable Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI>'s Collections) a Body of them who&s;e Leader was inflam'd with Love for a Woman, by martial Powers and Stratagem won a Fort from the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t leave all others at pre&s;ent to cele|brate the Prai&s;e of two of their unparallel'd Mo|narchs in <HI>India.</HI> The one was <HI>Perimal the Mag|nificent,</HI> a Prince mo&s;t Learned and Communica|tive, to whom in <HI>Malabar</HI> their exce&s;s of Zeal dedicated a Temple, rais'd on Seven hundred Pil|lars, not inferior in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maff. l. 1.</NOTE><HI>Maffaeus</HI>'s Opinion to tho&s;e of <HI>Agrippa</HI> in the <HI>Pantheon.</HI> The other <HI>Ha|nimant the Marvellous</HI> his Relation and Succe&s;&s;or, who&s;e Knowledge was &s;o great, as made his fol|lowers doubt if even that Wi&s;e Species cou'd ar|rive at &s;uch Perfection; and therefore they ra|ther imagin'd him and his Race a &s;ort of <HI>Gods</HI> form'd into <HI>Apes.</HI> His was the <HI>Tooth</HI> which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> took in <HI>Bi&s;nagar</HI> 1559, for which the <HI>Indians</HI> offer'd, according to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lin&s;chot. ch. 44.</NOTE><HI>Lin&s;chotten,</HI> the immen&s;e Sum of Seven hundred thou&s;and Ducats.

with all due re&s;pect <HI>Oran Outang</HI> the Great, the la&s;t of this Line: who&s;e unhappy Chance it was to fall into the Hands of <HI>Europeans.

<P>We mu&s;t now de&s;cend to con&s;ider this People, as &s;unk into the <HI>bruta Natura,</HI> by their continu|al Commerce with Bea&s;ts. Yet even at this time, what Experiments do they not afford us of relieving &s;ome from the Spleen, and others from Impo&s;thumes, by occa&s;ioning Laughter at pro|per Sea&s;ons? With what readine&s;s do they enter into the imitation of whatever is remarkable in Human Life? and what &s;urpri&s;ing Relations have <HI>Le Comte</HI> and others given of their Appe|tites, Actions, Conceptions, Affections, Varie|ties of Imaginations, and Abilities capable of pur|&s;uing them? If under their pre&s;ent low circum|&s;tances of <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Breeding,</HI> and in &s;o &s;hort a Term of Life as is now allotted them, they &s;o far exceed all Bea&s;ts, and equal many Men; what Prodigies may we not conceive of tho&s;e, who were <HI>Nati melioribus annis,</HI> tho&s;e Primitive <HI>Lon|gaeval</HI> and <HI>Antideluvian Man-Tegers,</HI> who fir&s;t taught Sciences to the World?</P>
<P>This Account, which is entirely my own, I am proud to imagine has traced Knowledge from a Fountain corre&s;pondent to &s;everal Opinions of the Ancients, tho' hitherto undi&s;cover'd, both

by them and the Moderns. And now what &s;hall I &s;ay to Mankind in the Thought of this great Di&s;covery? What, but that they &s;hould abate of their Pride, and con&s;ider that the Authors of our Knowledge are among <HI>Bea&s;ts:</HI> That the&s;e, who were our elder Brothers by a Day in the Crea|tion, who&s;e Kingdom was like the Scheme of <HI>Plato</HI> govern'd by Philo&s;ophers, who flouri&s;h'd with Learning in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> are now un|di&s;tingui&s;h'd from, and known only by the &s;ame Appellation, as the <HI>Man-Teger,</HI> and the <HI>Monkey!</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Speech,</HI> I make no que&s;tion that there are Remains of the Fir&s;t and le&s;s corrupted Race, in their Native De&s;erts, who yet have the Power of it. But the vulgar Rea&s;on given by the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that they will not &s;peak for fear of be|ing &s;et to Work,"</Q> is alone a &s;ufficient one, con&s;idering how exceedingly all other Learned Per&s;ons affect their <HI>Ea&s;e.</HI> A Second is, That the&s;e ob&s;ervant Creatures having been Eye-Wit|ne&s;&s;es of the <HI>Cruelty</HI> with which that Nation trea|ted their Brother <HI>Indians,</HI> find it nece&s;&s;ary not to &s;how them&s;elves to be <HI>Men,</HI> that they may be protected not only from Work, but from Cruel|ty al&s;o. Thirdly, They cou'd at be&s;t take no delight to conver&s;e with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who&s;e <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>&s;ullen</HI> Temper is &s;o aver&s;e to that na|tural and open <HI>Chearfulne&s;s,</HI> which is generally ob&s;erv'd to accompany all true Knowledge.</P>
<P>But now were it po&s;&s;ible, that any way cou'd be found out to draw forth their Latent Qualities, I cannot but think it wou'd be highly &s;erviceable to the Learned World, both in re&s;pect of reco|vering pa&s;t Knowledge, and promoting the Fu|ture.

<P>The Pope is now going to <HI>Benevento:</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having broke their Treaty; the Em|peror Trades to <HI>China;</HI> and <HI>Lilly,</HI> were he alive, mu&s;t be convinced, that it was not the Empre&s;s <HI>Fau&s;tina</HI> that was meant in the Pro|phecy.</P>
<P>It is evident by &s;everal Tokens about this wild Gentleman, that he had a Father and Mo|ther like one of us; but there being no Regi&s;ter of his Chri&s;tening, his Age is only to be gue&s;&s;ed at by his Stature and Countenance, and appeareth to be about Twelve or Thirteen. His being &s;o young was the Occa&s;ion of the great Di&s;appoint|ment of the Ladies, who came to the Drawing Room in full Expectation of &s;ome Attempt upon their Cha&s;tity: So far is true, that he endeavour'd to Ki&s;s the young Lady <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">le,</HI> who for that rea|&s;on is become the Envy of the Circle; this being a Declaration of Nature, in favour of her &s;upe|rior Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;aith, That Man is the mo&s;t Mimick of all Animals; which Opinion of that great Philo&s;opher is &s;trongly confirm'd by the Beha|viour of this wild Gentleman, who is endow'd with that Quality to an extream Degree. He receiv'd his fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions at Court: His
<PB N="108" REF="108">
Maners are, fir&s;t to lick People's Hands, and then turn his Breech upon them; to thur&s;t his Hand into every body's <HI>Pocket;</HI> to climb over People's <HI>Heads;</HI> and even to make u&s;e of the <HI>Royal Hand,</HI> to <HI>take</HI> what he has a mind to. At his fir&s;t Appearance he &s;eiz'd on the Lord Cham|berlain's Staff, and put on his Hat before the King; from whence &s;ome have conjectur'd, that he is either de&s;cended from a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Earls of <HI>King&s;ale</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> However, the&s;e are manife&s;t Tokens of his innate Ambi|tion; he is extreamly tenacious of his own Pro|perty, and ready to invade that of other People. By this mimick Quality he di&s;cover'd what wild Bea&s;t had nurs'd him: Ob&s;erving Children to ask Ble&s;&s;ing of their Mothers, one Day he fell down upon his Knees to a Sow, and mutter'd &s;ome Sounds in that humble Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>It has been commonly thought, that he is <HI>Ulrick</HI>'s natural Brother, becau&s;e of &s;ome re&s;em|blance of Manners, and the officious Care of <HI>Ul|rick</HI> about him; but the Superiority of the Parts and Genius in <HI>Peter,</HI> demon&s;trates this to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Though he is ignorant both of ancient and mo|dern Languages, (that Care being left to the inge|nious Phy&s;ician, who is entru&s;ted with his Educa|tion) yet he di&s;tingui&s;hes Objects by certain Sounds fram'd to him&s;elf, which Mr. <HI>Rotenberg,</HI> who brought him over, under&s;tands perfectly. Behold|ing one day the Shambles with great Fear and A&s;toni&s;hment, ever &s;ince he calls Man by the &s;ame Sound which expre&s;&s;eth Wolf. A young Lady is a Peacock, old Women Mag-pyes and Owls; a
<PB N="109" REF="109">
Beau with a <HI>Toupee,</HI> a Monkey; Gla&s;s, Ice; Blue, Red, and Green Ribbons, he calls Rainbows; an Heap of Gold a Turd. The fir&s;t Ship he &s;aw, he took to be a great Bea&s;t &s;wimming on her Back, and her Feet tied above her: The Men that came out of the Hold he took to be her Cubs, and won|der'd they were &s;o unlike their Dam. He under|&s;tands perfectly the Language of all Bea&s;ts and Birds, and is not, like them, confin'd to that of one Species. He can bring any Bea&s;t what he calls for, and no doubt is much mi&s;s'd now in his Na|tive Woods, where he us'd to do good Offices among his Fellow Citizens, and &s;erv'd as a Medi|ator to reconcile their Differences. One Day he warn'd a Flock of Sheep that were driving to the Shambles, of their Danger, and upon uttering &s;ome Sounds, they all fled. He takes va&s;t Plea&s;ure in Conver&s;ation with Hor&s;es; and going to the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> to conver&s;e with two of his intimate Ac|quaintances in the King's Stable, as he pa&s;s'd by, he Neighed to the hor&s;e at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> being as it were &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him &s;o high, he &s;eem'd to take it ill that the Hor&s;e did not an&s;wer him; but I think no body can undervalue his Under|&s;tanding for not being skill'd in Statuary.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;eth his Joy mo&s;t commonly by Neighing; and whatever the Philo&s;ophers may talk of their Ri&s;ibility, Neighing is a more No|ble Expre&s;&s;ion of that Pa&s;&s;ion than Laughing, which &s;eems to me to have &s;omething Silly in it; and be&s;ides, is often attended with Tears. Other Animals are &s;en&s;ible they deba&s;e them&s;elves, by mimicking Laughter; and I take it to be a general Ob&s;ervation, that the top Felicity of Mankind is
<PB N="110" REF="110">
to imitate Monkeys, and Birds: Witne&s;s <HI>Harte|quins, Scaramouches</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;querades;</HI> on the other Hand, Monkeys, when they would look extreamly &s;illy, endeavour to bring them&s;elves down to Mankind. Love he expre&s;&s;eth by the Cooing of a Dove, and Anger by the Croaking of a Raven, and it is not doubted but that he will &s;erve in Time as an Interpreter between us and other Animals.</P>
<P>Great In&s;truction is to be had from this wild Youth in the knowledge of Simples; and I am of Opinion, that he ought always to attend the Cen&s;ors of the College in their Vi&s;itation of Apo|thecaries Shops.</P>
<P>I am told that the new <HI>Sect</HI> of <HI>Herb-eaters</HI> in|tend to follow him into the Fields, or to beg him for a Clerk of their Kitchen: And that there are many of them now thinking of turning their Chil|dren into Woods to Graze with the Cattle, in hopes to rai&s;e a healthy and moral Race, refin'd from the Corruptions of this Luxurious World.</P>
<P>He &s;ings naturally &s;everal pretty Tunes of his own Compo&s;ing, and with equal Facility, in the <HI>Chromatick, Inharmonick,</HI> and <HI>Diatonick</HI> Stile, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be of infinite U&s;e to the Academy, in judging of the Merits of their Com|po&s;ers, and is the only Per&s;on that ought to decide betwixt <HI>Cuzzoni</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tina.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot omit his fir&s;t Notion of Cloaths, which he took to be the natural Skins of the Crea|tures that wore them, and &s;eem'd to be in great Pain for the pulling off a Stocking, thinking the poor Man was a Fleaing.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that there are di&s;affected Peo|ple,
<PB N="111" REF="111">
who &s;ay he is a <HI>Pretender,</HI> and no genuine wild Man. This Calumny proceeds from the fal&s;e Notions they have of wild Men, which they frame from &s;uch as they &s;ee about the Town, who&s;e Actions are rather ab&s;urd than wild; therefore it will be incumbent on all young Gentlemen, who are ambitious to excel in this Character, to Copy this true Original of Nature.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;es of this wild Man are va&s;tly more acute than tho&s;e of a tame One; he can follow the Track of a Man, or any other Bea&s;t of Prey. A Dog is an A&s;s to him for finding Troufles; his Hearing is more perfect, becau&s;e his Ears not ha|ving been confin'd by Bandages, he can move them like a Drill, and turn them towards the So|norous Object.</P>
<P>Let us pray the Creator of all Beings, Wild and Tame, that as this wild Youth, by being brought to Court, has been made a Chri&s;tian; &s;o &s;uch as are at Court, and are no Chri&s;tians, may lay a&s;ide their Savage and Rapacious Nature, and return to the Meekne&s;s of the Go&s;pel.</P>

<HEAD>An INFALIBLE SCHEME To Pay the PUBLICK DEBT OF IRELAND in Six Months.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Di&s;tre&s;s of this unhappy <HI>Country,</HI> is too vi&s;ible to all, except tho&s;e who have Power to redre&s;s it.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve thro' the whole Nation one univer&s;al Complaint of the Decay of Trade, the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Landlords, and the Deficiency of Money; and yet I cannot find among all the Schemes propo&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the&s;e Evils, any one in particular, which &s;eems likely to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>But, what is &s;till an Addition to this me|lancholy Pro&s;pect of Affairs, is the unbounded <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Extravagance,</HI> both in Apparel and
<PB N="113" REF="113">
Entertaiments, which Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Degrees run into at pre&s;ent, tho' in general we labour under &s;uch Hard&s;hips and Poverty.</P>
<P>We are affected in a quite different Manner from all the Nations upon Earth; for, with others, <HI>Wealth</HI> is the Mother of <HI>Luxury,</HI> but with us <HI>Poverty</HI> has the very &s;ame Effect: With others, <HI>Scarcity</HI> is the Parent of Indu&s;try, but with us it is the Nur&s;e of <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Vice.</HI></P>
<P>We labour to imitate our neighbouring King|doms in nothing but their Extravagance, with|out having the &s;ame plentiful Aids of <HI>Commerce,</HI> or applying our&s;elves to the Study of <HI>Fair-deal|ing</HI> to maintain it. So that, in &s;hort, by our own ill Management, we are brought to &s;o low an Ebb of Wealth and Credit, that our Condi|tion &s;eems incapable of any Relief.</P>
<P>But as I have the Intere&s;t of this mi&s;guided People very much at Heart, I do not intend this E&s;&s;ay as a Detection of their pre&s;ent Grievan|ces, but as a Remedy again&s;t them. And for that Purpo&s;e I have labour'd to find out &s;uch a <HI>Scheme</HI> as will di&s;charge our publick Debt with all po&s;&s;ible Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure to the Subject, and in &s;o &s;hort a Time, that we may neither com|plain of being oppre&s;&s;ed with long continued Taxes, (as &s;ome unrea&s;onable People often pre|&s;ume to do) nor quite de&s;pair of being once more in a thriving Condition.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider what tho&s;e <HI>Vices</HI> are, which at pre&s;ent prevail mo&s;t among us; and I believe, upon Enquiry, they will be found <HI>Perjury, For|nication, Drunkenne&s;s, Swearing, Slander, Infi|delity, Fraud, Bla&s;phemy,</HI> and many others.
<PB N="114" REF="114">
Would it not then be worthy of our Con&s;iderati|on whether a moderate Tax upon every parti|cular <HI>Vice,</HI> in&s;tead of laying an additional Duty upon <HI>Wine, Hops,</HI> and other Commodities, wou'd not &s;upply us with a &s;ufficient Sum in a very &s;hort Time? Such a Tax mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity yield a va&s;t Revenue, and prove the mo&s;t infallible, and indeed the only Scheme for our Pro&s;peri|ty, if it &s;hall be thought proper to be conti|nued.</P>
<P>But, before I proceed to Particulars, it may not be ami&s;s to premi&s;e, that this Tax is not de&s;igned for any one County or Province in this Kingdom, but to extend it&s;elf univer&s;ally over the whole Nation; becau&s;e different Vices may flouri&s;h in different Counties, as different Plants in their different Soils; as <HI>Perjury</HI> in one, <HI>Theft</HI> in another, <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation</HI> and <HI>Flattery</HI> in an|other, <HI>Rapine</HI> in another, and &s;o of the re&s;t: However, I take <HI>Theft</HI> to be our peculiar <HI>&s;taple Vice.</HI></P>
<P>And lea&s;t any Di&s;putes may hereafter ari&s;e about the Nature of <HI>Perjury,</HI> the Intention of the <HI>Act</HI> in this particular, or what Per&s;ons are to be &s;ubject to this Tax, I mu&s;t here al&s;o pre|mi&s;e, that every <HI>Lie</HI> confirmed by an Oath, is undoubtedly <HI>Perjury,</HI> whether before a <HI>Ma|gi&s;trate,</HI> or behind a <HI>Counter.</HI> And, therefore, we do not doubt, but the Trading Part of our People, will be great Benefactors to the Pub|lick, in this particular Article, as well as many others.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Things being premis'd, let us
<PB N="115" REF="115">
&s;uppo&s;e that in this large Country, 5000 Per|&s;ons are guilty of this Infirmity each Day-Which Computation mu&s;t be allow'd very mo|derate, if we recollect that this Number is not above a four-hundredth Part of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom, who are generally computed to amount to <HI>Two Millions.</HI> And if we further con&s;ider what &s;trong Inducements our Natives have to practi&s;e it, from its being often &s;o ex|ceeding beneficial; if we con&s;ider the great U&s;e made of it in all Sorts of <HI>Traffick;</HI> the great Demands for it in <HI>Law-&s;uits;</HI> the great Advan|tage of it in <HI>Elections,</HI> and the undeniable Profit of it in all <HI>Pro&s;ecutions,</HI> we &s;hall think the Num|ber of 5000 &s;till more rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;uppo&s;e every one of this Number to be perjur'd, only once every Day, (which is a very favourable Suppo&s;ition) and &s;ubject only to a Tax of Sixpence for each Offence; for which Sum, perhaps, he may procure either the Death of an Enemy, an E&s;tate for his Friend, or a Fortune for him&s;elf, (all which are e&s;teem'd very de&s;irable) the Tax will be too incon&s;idera|ble to make any one murmur, and yet will yield the Sum of 125<HI>l. per Day,</HI> towards di&s;charging our National Debt.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this Tax, tho' very low, may in Reality be very profitable for Mankind; for <HI>At|tornies, Sollicitors, U&s;urers, Butchers,</HI> and other hone&s;t Traders, will &s;carce think it an&s;werable to the Expence of Time, to for&s;wear them&s;elves for any Profit from One Penny to Six Pence in|clu&s;ive, (as now cu&s;tomary) but will at lea&s;t,
<PB N="116" REF="116">
for every Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, expect to gain &s;ufficient to defray the Tax.</P>
<P>However, I would have all &s;worn <HI>Con&s;tables,</HI> and all <HI>Collectors</HI> of this and many other Taxes, entirely exempted from any Penalty as priviledg'd Per&s;ons; becau&s;e by that Means they will be enabled to be very &s;erviceable in their &s;everal Stations.</P>
<P>Fornication, as the World is at pre&s;ent, would furni&s;h the Publick with a large Sum, even at a very moderate Tax; for it is now made an e&s;&s;ential Part of the polite Gentleman's Chara|cter, and he that has prevail'd on the greate&s;t Number, proportionably ri&s;es in Reputation.</P>
<P>Let us then compute that in the &s;everal Parts of this Nation, 5000 <HI>per</HI> Day, were liable to be taxed for this general Vice, only at two Shillings: The Sum ari&s;ing from this to the publick Good, will amount to 500<HI>l. per</HI> Day, and in Six Months to almo&s;t one Third of our National Debt.</P>
<P>I know it may be here objected, that I have computed upon too &s;mall a Number, and that I might ju&s;tly account rather upon Twenty or Thirty Thou&s;and <HI>per</HI> Day, in the &s;everal Coun|ties of this Kingdom: But, tho' I own this Ob|jection to be very &s;trong, if we were to con&s;ider the Opportunities of <HI>Wakes, Patron-Days, Hay|making</HI> Sea&s;ons, <HI>May-Days, Religious Pilgrima|ges to Holy Wells, Balls</HI> publick and private, and many other commodious Scenes for that kind of Entertainment; yet I would rather chu&s;e to err on the right Side in too &s;mall, than too great a Computation.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="117">
I know the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Clergy will make &s;trong Remon&s;trances again&s;t this Tax; and plead, that it is de&s;ign'd to oppre&s;s them; that all Nations of the Earth allow them a <HI>Toleration</HI> in this particular Point, as they are <HI>frail</HI> Mortals, and &s;worn to <HI>Celibacy;</HI> and what is &s;till wor&s;e, that &s;uch a Tax would be the mo&s;t effectual Means to drain them of their whole Revenues; but as I would not have &s;uch pious Per&s;ons ju&s;tly complain of the lea&s;t Rigour, I &s;hall readily agree to their being exempted.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s I would only Tax at Six Pence, becau&s;e it might be prejudicial to <HI>His Maje&s;ty's Revenue,</HI> to di&s;courage it, and con&s;equently &s;ub|ject the Propo&s;er to Penalties.</P>
<P>Let us then compute, that only Twenty Thou&s;and Per&s;ons, (which is but one hundredth Part of the People in this Kingdom) were daily liable to be tax'd, the Amount would be 500<HI>l. per</HI> Day. And how extreamly moderate this Computation is, may appear to any one who con&s;iders, that be&s;ides the u&s;ual Opportunities of <HI>Taverns,</HI> and <HI>private Hou&s;es,</HI> there are <HI>Ele|ctions, Fairs, Mayor</HI>'s <HI>Fea&s;ts, Univer&s;ity Treats, Corporation Dinners, Chri&s;tmas Regales, Wed|dings</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tnings,</HI> both in Town and Coun|try, and many other irre&s;i&s;tible Inducements to this manly Vice, which would, perhaps, if nice|ly calculated, daily furni&s;h us with two Thirds more than our computed Number, and by that Means greatly conduce to the Publick Good.</P>
<P>But, however, I would by all Means exempt all Country <HI>Ju&s;tices of the Peace,</HI> whether
<PB N="118" REF="118">
<HI>Squires</HI> or <HI>Par&s;ons:</HI> becau&s;e it would be un&s;eem|ly to &s;ee &s;uch honourable and reverend Per&s;ona|ges in&s;ulted by meaner Officers, as often as they might be di&s;cover'd in &s;uch a Condition.</P>
<P>Swearing would be a mo&s;t univer&s;al Benefit in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e, at pre&s;ent, it &s;erves to &s;ea&s;on the Di&s;cour&s;e of all Ranks and Degrees of Men. It is the principal Ingredient and Decoration of all modern <HI>Jokes, Gibes, Quarrels, Love-Speeches, Di&s;putes, Threats</HI> and <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> and con&s;equently capable of affording an incredible Revenue.</P>
<P>However, let us &s;uppo&s;e 40000 Per&s;ons <HI>per</HI> Day, liable to the Tax of Six Pence only for each Offence of this Kind; which, con&s;idering the great Number of <HI>Markets, Coffee-Hou&s;es, Shambles, Barracks,</HI> and <HI>Gaming-Hou&s;es</HI> in this Kingdom, is a very incon&s;iderable Number; yet even this Article will furni&s;h us with 1000<HI>l. per</HI> Day, which would amount to near two Thirds of the publick Debt.</P>
<P>Our Laws have amerced each Offence in this way at One Shilling, ordering one half to the Informer, and the other to the Poor, which, in my humble Opinion, was very ill concerted; for if the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> did really intend that this Law &s;hould be punctually enforced, they ought to have divided the whole <HI>Mulct</HI> between the <HI>In|former</HI> and the <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> without any regard to the Poor, and then, they might be a&s;&s;ured, it would be vigorou&s;ly executed.</P>
<P>I am already apprehen&s;ive, that all military Per&s;ons will expect an Exemption from Taxes on this Account; becau&s;e they may plead Pre|cedents
<PB N="119" REF="119">
for many Generations, may alledge the Power of Cu&s;tom, the Decency and Comline&s;s of it, when properly mingled with other Di&s;|cour&s;e, or that the cen&s;orious World would per|haps &s;u&s;pect they knew nothing of <HI>God</HI> at all, if they did not &s;ometimes mention his Name; and many other Rea&s;ons of equal Weight: But though the&s;e Remon&s;trances are very ju&s;t, yet as this is the only Means by which, &s;ome think a Standing Army can conduce to the national Good, it will be hard to exempt them.</P>
<P>However, as the military Power would infal|libly be liable to this Tax in all its Branches, by which Means they might be utterly impove|ri&s;h'd, I believe it may not be improper to al|low all <HI>Foot-Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> all young <HI>En&s;igns,</HI> &s;pruce <HI>Cornets,</HI> naval <HI>Captains, Cabin-Boys</HI> and <HI>Quarter-Ma&s;ters,</HI> forty or fifty Oaths a Day, entirely free from any Tax or Pe|nalty.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Slander,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing only twenty thou|&s;and <HI>per</HI> Day, taxed at Six Pence for every Of|fence, this Article would daily afford the Publick (at the lowe&s;t rea&s;onable Computation) five hun|dred Pounds.</P>
<P>And, as this is a favourite Talent, we might have ventur'd to tax it much higher; but I would not &s;eem to di&s;courage &s;o charitable a Di&s;|po&s;ition, e&s;pecially where it may promote the Intere&s;t of my Country.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> I have been always too great an Admirer of theirs, to de&s;ire any Re|&s;triction &s;hould be laid on their Plea&s;ure, either private or publick; and therefore I would have
<PB N="120" REF="120">
them tax'd only half as much as the Men for every little Error of this Kind; becau&s;e <HI>Slan|der,</HI> in Men, is a Talent unnatural and acquired, and generally practi&s;ed to ingratiate them&s;elves with the oppo&s;ite Sex; whereas this genteel Fail|ing in <HI>Females,</HI> is innate, and impo&s;&s;ible to be re&s;train'd; which is a Ca&s;e that demands our ut|mo&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I think all <HI>Drawing-Rooms, A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and all Places of publick Re&s;ort for Ladies, ought to be exempt from any Penalty, becau&s;e it is &s;o ma|terial a Part of the Di&s;cour&s;e and Amu&s;ement of tho&s;e Places, that to tax them for each Offence, would be in Effect, to enjoin them perpetual Si|lence; which, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would be too great a Misfortune, both to them&s;elves and the World, to be exacted from them.</P>
<P>Infidelity and <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI> would furni&s;h us with a con&s;iderable Sum; and as they are not originally of our own Growth, but annually imported from neighbouring Kingdoms, they ought to be &s;ubject to &s;ome Duty, which in few Years would probably be a va&s;t Addition to the publick Revenue. Yet as this Traffick is prin|cipally carried on by young <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and <HI>tra|velling Squires,</HI> any Attempt to tax it would certainly meet with too vigorous an Oppo&s;ition. But on condition it might pa&s;s into a Law, I would gladly exempt both <HI>Lawyers</HI> of all Ages, <HI>Subaltern,</HI> and <HI>Field-Officers, young Heirs, Dan|cing-Ma&s;ters, Pick-Pockets,</HI> and <HI>Players,</HI></P>

<P>But, left by the univer&s;al Poverty of our People, which is much to be fear'd, or by their growing more virtuous, which never can be rea&s;onably ap|prehended, this daily Income &s;hould fall &s;hort of what we have computed, I mu&s;t humbly beg Leave to offer &s;ome other Improvements of this Scheme, which will undoubtedly an&s;wer all Defi|ciencies.</P>
<P>And for this Purpo&s;e, what if a &s;evere Tax was laid on all manner of Per&s;ons who pre&s;um'd to marry 'till they were full Forty Years old? If any &s;hould prove Fool-hardy enough to tran&s;gre&s;s a Law &s;o calculated for the Happine&s;s of Men, each Offence would be of &s;ignal Benefit to the Publick; and if providentially it &s;hould prove an effectual
<PB N="122" REF="122">
Re&s;traint, there mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be fewer Chil|dren in each Family, and of Con&s;equence the Number of Beggars and Wretches in this King|dom mu&s;t proportionably decrea&s;e. And what would &s;till be more material, perhaps, in one Age, if this beneficial Act &s;hould be continued, the greate&s;t part of this Country would require to be new peopled from <HI>E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d;</HI> a Circum&s;tance greatly to be wi&s;h'd; becau&s;e &s;uch an Accident would probably cure that Nation of its inveterate Antipathy to the Inhabitants of this, at lea&s;t for &s;ome Generations.</P>
<P>As for the Scheme to tax Batchelors, which has lately been propos'd to the Hou&s;e by one of its Honourable Members, I mu&s;t beg leave to think it highly improper; becau&s;e batchelors, of all Ranks and Degrees, are real Benefactors to the Publick, by not furni&s;hing it either with <HI>Beggars,</HI> or <HI>Oppre&s;|&s;ors of Beggars,</HI> one of which mu&s;t infallibly be the Con&s;equence of Marriage in this Country.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;t, that all young <HI>Clergymen,</HI> who, with more Pa&s;&s;ion than Pru|dence, &s;hall dare to marry before they are bene|fic'd, may be liable to a mo&s;t &s;evere Tax, equal to a Prohibition; becau&s;e &s;uch Offenders mu&s;t inevitably multiply <HI>Beggars,</HI> live in <HI>Contempt,</HI> and die in <HI>Poverty.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other Expedients, might ea|&s;ily be found upon any Emergency to furni&s;h con|&s;iderable Sums for the National Debt.</P>
<P>But as there will remain about 177,750<HI>l.</HI> over and above our publick Debt, I will allow One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds of it for Sallaries, to
<PB N="123" REF="123">
&s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hall be appointed Collectors, and I hope this will be a rea&s;onable Provi&s;ion, tho' ge|nerally above one half of every Tax is expended in paying proper Officers to collect it. The Overplus may be depo&s;ited in the Trea&s;ury for any other pious U&s;e.</P>
<P>And if this Scheme &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to &s;ucceed, as I have no Rea&s;on to doubt from the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of the H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, all tho&s;e Noblemen who &s;hall be appointed Commi&s;&s;i|oners, will have excellent Opportunities of pro|moting their <HI>Nephews, Cou&s;ins, Footmen, Fo&s;ter|ers, Valets,</HI> and other valuable Dependants, to good Incomes, and Places of Tru&s;t and Credit. But I would, by all Means, have none but <HI>En|gli&s;hmen</HI> nominated to be Tax Gatherers; becau&s;e we may rationally &s;uppo&s;e, that they will be en|tirely free from Prejudice, in Favour of the Na|tives of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus would a moderate Tax upon our <HI>Vices</HI> ap|parently contribute to &s;ave this Nation from utter Ruin. Many Per&s;ons who have not the lea&s;t Ex|cu&s;e for their Irregularities at pre&s;ent, (except the commendable Publick-&s;pirited Contempt for Reli|gion) might then plead in their own Defence, that their Immoralities had pre&s;erved their Coun|try.

<HEAD>A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR Preventing the Children of poor people in <HI>Ireland,</HI> from being a Burden to their Parents or Coun|try, and for making them Bene|ficial to the Publick.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a melancholy Object to tho&s;e, who walk through this great Town or travel in the Coun|try, when they &s;ee the <HI>Streets,</HI> the <HI>Roads</HI> and <HI>Cabbin-doors</HI> crowded with <HI>Beggars</HI> of the Female Sex, followed by three, four, or &s;ix Children, <HI>all in Rags,</HI> and importuning every Pa&s;&s;enger for an Alms. The&s;e <HI>Mothers</HI> in&s;tead of being able to work for their hone&s;t livelyhood, are forced to employ all their time in Stroling to beg Su&s;tenance for their <HI>helple&s;s Infants,</HI> who, as they grow up, either turn <HI>Thieves</HI> for want of Work, or leave their <HI>dear Native Country, to fight for the Pretender in</HI> Spain, or &s;ell them&s;elves to the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="126">
I think it is agreed by all Parties, that this pro|digious number of Children in the Arms, or on the Backs, or at the <HI>Heels</HI> of their <HI>Mothers,</HI> and fre|quently of their <HI>Fathers,</HI> is <HI>in the pre&s;ent deplora|ble &s;tate of the Kingdom,</HI> a very great additional Grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and ea&s;y method of making the&s;e Children &s;ound and u&s;eful Members of the Com|mon-wealth, would de&s;erve &s;o well of the Publick, as to have his Statue &s;et up for a Pre&s;erver of the Nation.</P>
<P>But my Intention is very far from being confi|ned to provide only for the Children of <HI>profe&s;&s;ed Beggars,</HI> it is of a much greater Extent, and &s;hall take in the whole Number of Infants at a certain Age, who are born of Parents in effect as little able to &s;upport them, as tho&s;e who demand our Chari|ty in the Streets.</P>
<P>As to my own Part, having turned my Thoughts, for many Years, upon this important Subject, and maturely weighed the &s;everal <HI>Schemes for no Projectors,</HI> I have always found them gro&s;s|ly mi&s;taken in their Computation. It is true, a Child <HI>ju&s;t dropt from its Dam,</HI> may be &s;upported by her Milk, for a Solar Year with little other Nou|ri&s;hment, at mo&s;t not above the Value of two Shil|lings, which the Mother may certainly get, or the Value in <HI>Scraps,</HI> by her lawful Occupation of Begging; and it is exactly at one Year Old that I propo&s;e to provide for them in &s;uch a Manner, as, in&s;tead of being a Charge upon their <HI>Parents,</HI> or the <HI>Pari&s;h,</HI> or <HI>wanting Food and Raiment</HI> for the re&s;t of their Lives, they &s;hall, on the Contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the

Cloathing of many Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another great Advantage in my Scheme, that it will prevent tho&s;e <HI>voluntary Abortions,</HI> and that horrid Practice of <HI>Women murdering their Ba&s;tard Children,</HI> alas! too fre|quent among us, Sacrificing the <HI>poor innocent Babes,</HI> I doubt, more to avoid the Expence than the Shame, which would move Tears and Pity in the mo&s;t &s;avage and inhuman Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The number of Souls in this Kingdom being u&s;ually reckoned one Million and a half. Of the&s;e I calculate there may be about two hundred thou|&s;and Couple who&s;e Wives are Breeders; from which number I &s;ub&s;tract thirty Thou&s;and Cou|ples, who are able to maintain their own Children, although I apprehend there cannot be &s;o many, under <HI>the pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Kingdom;</HI> but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and &s;eventy Thou&s;and Breeders. I again &s;ub&s;tract fifty Thou&s;and, for tho&s;e Women who mi&s;carry, or who&s;e Children die by accident, or di&s;ea&s;e within the Year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thou&s;and Children of poor Parents an|nually born: The que&s;tion therefore is, How this number &s;hall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already &s;aid, under the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs, is utterly impo&s;&s;ible by all the Methods hitherto propo&s;ed; for we can <HI>neither employ them in Handicraft</HI> or <HI>Agriculture;</HI> we neither build Hou&s;es, (I mean in the Country) nor cul|tivate Land: They can very &s;eldom pick up a Livelihood <HI>by Stealing</HI> 'till they arrive at &s;ix years old; except where they are of towardly parts; although, I confe&s;s, they learn the Rudiments
<PB N="128" REF="128">
much earlier; during which time they can how|ever be properly looked upon only as <HI>Probationers;</HI> as I have been informed by a principal Gentleman in the County of <HI>Cavan,</HI> who prote&s;ted to me, that he never knew above one or two In&s;tances under the Age of &s;ix, even in a part of the King|dom <HI>&s;o renowned for the quicke&s;t Proficiency in that Art.</HI></P>
<P>I am a&s;&s;ured by our Merchants, that a Boy or a Girl before twelve years old, is no &s;aleable Commodity, and even when they come to this Age, they will not yield above three Pounds, or three Pounds and half a Crown at mo&s;t, on the Exchange; which cannot turn to Account either to the Parents or Kingdom, the Charge of Nutriment and Rags having been at lea&s;t four times that Value.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now therefore humbly propo&s;e my own Thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the lea&s;t Objection.</P>
<P>I have been a&s;&s;ured by a very knowing <HI>Ame|rican</HI> of my Acquaintance in <HI>London,</HI> that a young healthy Child well Nur&s;ed, is, at a Year old, a mo&s;t delicious nouri&s;hing and whole&s;ome Food, whether <HI>Stewed, Roa&s;ted, Baked,</HI> or <HI>Boiled,</HI> and I make no doubt that it will equally &s;erve in a <HI>Frica&s;ie,</HI> or a <HI>Ragou&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I do therefore humbly offer it to <HI>publick Con|&s;ideration,</HI> that of the Hundred and twenty thou&s;and Children, already computed, twenty thou&s;and may be re&s;erved for Breed, whereof only one fourth Part to be Males; which is more than we allow to <HI>Sheep, black Cattle,</HI> or <HI>Swine,</HI> and my Rea&s;on is, that the&s;e Children are &s;eldom the Fruits of Marriage, <HI>a Circum&s;tance not much</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="129">
<HI>regarded by our Savages,</HI> therefore, <HI>one Male</HI> will be &s;ufficient to &s;erve four Females. That the remaining Hundred thou&s;and may at a Year old, be offered in Sale to the Per&s;ons of <HI>Qua|lity</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> through the Kingdom, al|ways advi&s;ing the Mother to let them Suck plen|tifully in the la&s;t Month, &s;o as to render them Plump, and Fat for a good Table. A Child will make two Di&s;hes at an Entertainment for Friends, and when the Family dines alone, the fore or hind Quarter will make a rea&s;onable Di&s;h, and &s;ea&s;oned with a little Pepper or Salt will be very good Boiled on the fourth Day, e&s;pecially in <HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>I have reckoned upon a Medium, that a Child ju&s;t born will weigh 12 Pounds, and in a &s;olar Year, if tolerably nur&s;ed, encrea&s;eth to 28 Pounds.</P>
<P>I grant this food will be &s;omewhat dear, and therefore very <HI>proper for Landlords,</HI> who, as they have already devoured mo&s;t of the Parents, &s;eem to have the be&s;t Title to the Children.</P>
<P>Infant's fle&s;h will be in Sea&s;on throughout the Year, but more plentiful in <HI>March,</HI> and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave Au|thor, an eminent <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;ician, that <HI>Fi&s;h being a prolifick Dyet,</HI> there are more Children born in <HI>Roman Catholick Countries</HI> about nine Months after <HI>Lent,</HI> than at any other Sea&s;on; therefore reckoning a Year after <HI>Lent,</HI> the Mar|kets will be more glutted than u&s;ual, becau&s;e the Number of <HI>Popi&s;h Infants,</HI> is at lea&s;t three to one in this Kingdom, and therefore it will have one other Collateral Advantage, by le&s;&s;ening the Number of <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> among us.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="130">
I have already computed the Charge of nur|&s;ing a Beggar's Child (in which Li&s;t I reckon all <HI>Cottagers, Labourers,</HI> and four-fifths of the <HI>Far|mers</HI>) to be about two Shillings <HI>per Annum,</HI> Rags included; and I believe no Gentleman would repine to give Ten Shillings for the <HI>Carca&s;s of a good fat Child,</HI> which, as I have &s;aid, will make four Di&s;hes of excellent Nutritive Meat, when he hath only &s;ome particular Friend, or his own Family to dine with him. Thus the Squire will learn to be a good Landlord, and grow popular among his Tenants, the Mother will have Eight Shillings neat Profit, and be fit for Work 'till &s;he produces another Child.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are more thrifty <HI>(as I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Times require)</HI> may flea the Carca&s;s; the Skin of which, Artificially dre&s;&s;ed, will make admirable <HI>Gloves, for Ladies,</HI> and <HI>Summer Boots</HI> for <HI>fine Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>As to our City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> Shambles may be appointed for this purpo&s;e, in the mo&s;t conve|nient Parts of it, and Butchers we may be a&s;&s;u|red will not be wanting; although I rather re|commend buying the Children alive, and dre&s;&s;ing them hot from the Knife, as we do <HI>roa&s;ting Pigs.</HI></P>
<P>A very worthy Per&s;on, <HI>a true Lover of his Country,</HI> and who&s;e Virtues I highly e&s;teem, was lately plea&s;ed, in di&s;cour&s;ing on this Matter, to offer a Refinement upon my Scheme. He &s;aid, that many Gentlemen of this Kingdom, having of late de&s;troyed their Deer, he conceived that the Want of Veni&s;on might be well &s;upply'd by the Bodies of young Lads and Maidens, not ex|ceeding
<PB N="131" REF="131">
fourteen Years of Age, nor under twelve; &s;o great a Number of both Sexes in every Coun|try being now ready to &s;tarve for want of Work and Service: And the&s;e to be di&s;po&s;ed of by their Parents if alive, or otherwi&s;e by their neare&s;t Re|lations. But with due deference to &s;o excellent a Friend, and &s;o de&s;erving a Patriot, I cannot be altogether in his Sentiments; for as to the Males, my <HI>American</HI> Acquaintance a&s;&s;ured me from frequent Experience, that their Fle&s;h was generally Tough and Lean, like that of our School-boys, by continual Exerci&s;e, and their Ta&s;te di&s;agreeable, and to fatten them would not an&s;wer the Charge. Then as to the Females, it would, I think, with humble Submi&s;&s;ion, <HI>be a Lo&s;s to the Publick,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;oon would become Breeders them&s;elves: And be&s;ides, it is not improbable that &s;ome &s;crupulous People might be apt to Cen&s;ure &s;uch a Practice, (although in|deed very unju&s;tly) as a little bordering upon Cruelty, which, I confe&s;s, hath always been with me the &s;tronge&s;t Objection again&s;t any Pro|ject, how well &s;oever intended.</P>
<P>But in order to ju&s;tify my Friend, he confe&s;|&s;ed, that this Expedient was put into his Head by the famous <HI>Sallmanaazor,</HI> a Native of the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> who came from thence to <HI>London,</HI> above twenty Years ago, and in Conver&s;ation told my Friend, that in his Country, when any young Per&s;on happened to be put to Death, the Executioner &s;old the Carca&s;s to <HI>Per&s;ons of Qua|lity,</HI> as a prime Dainty, and that, in his Time, the Body of a plump Girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an Attempt to poi&s;on the Emperor,
<PB N="132" REF="132">
was &s;old to his Imperial <HI>Maje&s;ty's prime Mini&s;ter of State,</HI> and other great <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Court, <HI>in Joints from the Gibbet,</HI> at four hundred Crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the &s;ame U&s;e were made of &s;everal plump young Girls in this Town, who without one &s;ingle Groat to their Fortunes, cannot &s;tir abroad without a Chair, and appear at a <HI>Play-hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> in fo|reign Fineries, which they never will pay for; the Kingdom would not be the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons of a de&s;ponding Spirit are in great Concern about that va&s;t Number of poor People, who are Aged, Di&s;ea&s;ed, or Maimed, and I have been de&s;ired to employ my Thoughts what Cour&s;e may be taken, to ea&s;e the Nation of &s;o grievous an Incumbrance. But I am not in the lea&s;t Pain upon that Matter, becau&s;e it is very well known, that they are every Day <HI>dy|ing,</HI> and <HI>rotting,</HI> by <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Famine,</HI> and <HI>Filth,</HI> and <HI>Vermin,</HI> as fa&s;t as can be rea&s;onably expect|ed. And as to the young Labourers, they are now in almo&s;t as hopeful a Condition. They cannot get Work, and con&s;equently pine away for want of Nouri&s;hment, to a degree, that if at any Time they are accidentally hired to com|mon Labour, they have not Strength to perform it, and thus the Country and them&s;elves are hap|pily delivered from the Evils to come.</P>
<P>I have too long digre&s;&s;ed, and therefore &s;hall return to my Subject, I think the Advantages by the Propo&s;al which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the highe&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as I have already ob&s;erved, it would

greatly le&s;&s;en <HI>the Number of Papi&s;ts,</HI> with whom we are Yearly over-run, being the principal Bree|ders of the Nation, as well as our mo&s;t dangerous Enemies, and who &s;tay at home on purpo&s;e with a De&s;ign <HI>to deliver the Kingdom to the Pretender,</HI> hoping to take their Advantage by the Ab&s;ence <HI>of &s;o many good Prote&s;tants,</HI> who have cho&s;en rather to leave their Country, than &s;tay at home, and pay Tithes again&s;t their Con&s;cience, to an <HI>Epi&s;|copal Curate.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whereas the Maintainance of an hun|dred thou&s;and Children, from two Years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at le&s;s than Ten Shillings a piece <HI>per Annum,</HI> the Nation's Stock will be thereby encrea&s;ed fifty thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> be&s;ides the Profit of a new Di&s;h, in|troduced to the Tables of all <HI>Gentlemen of Fortune</HI> in the Kingdom, who have any Refinement in Ta&s;te, and the Money will circulate among our Selves, the Goods being entirely of our own Growth and Manufacture.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The con&s;tant Breeders, be&s;ides the Gain of eight Shillings <HI>Sterling per Annum,</HI> by the Sale of their Children, will be rid of the Charge of maintaining them after the fir&s;t Year.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="134">
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> This Food would likewi&s;e bring great <HI>Cu&s;tom to Taverns,</HI> where the Vintners will cer|tainly be &s;o prudent as to procure the be&s;t Receipts for dre&s;&s;ing it to Perfection; and con&s;equently have their Hou&s;es frequented by all the fine <HI>Gen|tlemen,</HI> who ju&s;tly value them&s;elves upon their Knowledge in good Eating; and a skilful Cook, who under&s;tands how to oblige his Gue&s;ts, will contrive to make it as expen&s;ive as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> This would be a great Inducement to Marriage, which all wi&s;e Nations have either en|couraged by Rewards, or enforced by Laws and Penalties. It would encrea&s;e the Care and Tender|ne&s;s of Mothers towards their Children, when they were &s;ure of a Settlement for Life, to the poor Babes, provided in &s;ome Sort by the Publick, to their annual Profit in&s;tead of Expence; we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee an hone&s;t Emulation among the married Women, <HI>which of them could bring the fat|te&s;t Child to the Market.</HI> Men would become as <HI>fond</HI> of their Wives, during the Time of their Pregnancy, as they are now of their <HI>Mares</HI> in Foal, their <HI>Cows</HI> in Calf, or <HI>Sows</HI> when they are ready to farrow, nor offer to beat or kick them (as is too <HI>frequent</HI> a Practice) for fear of a Mi&s;car|riage.</P>
<P>Many other advantages might be enumerated. For In&s;tance, the Addition of &s;ome thou&s;and Car|ca&s;&s;es in our exportation of Barrel'd Beef: The Pro|pagation of <HI>Swines Fle&s;h,</HI> and Improvement in the Art of making good <HI>Bacon,</HI> &s;o much wanted among us by the great De&s;truction of <HI>Pigs,</HI> too frequent at our Tables, which are no way comparable in
<PB N="135" REF="135">
Ta&s;te, or Magnificence to a well grown, fat Yearly Child, which roa&s;ted whole will make a con&s;iderable Figure at a <HI>Lord Mayor's Fea&s;t,</HI> or any other Publick Entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being &s;tudious of Brevity.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that one thou&s;and Families in this City, would be con&s;tant Cu&s;tomers for Infants Fle&s;h, be&s;ides others who might have it at <HI>merry Meetings,</HI> particularly at <HI>Weddings</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;ten|ings,</HI> I compute that <HI>Dublin</HI> would take off Annu|ally about twenty thou&s;and Carca&s;&s;es and the re&s;t of the Kingdom (where probably they will be &s;old &s;omewhat cheaper) the remaining eighty Thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>I can think of no one Objection, that will po&s;|&s;ibly be rai&s;ed again&s;t this Propo&s;al, unle&s;s it &s;hould be urged, that the Number of People will be thereby much le&s;&s;ened in the Kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas indeed one principal De|&s;ign in offering it to the World. I de&s;ire the Reader will ob&s;erve, that I calculate my Remedy <HI>for this one individual Kingdom of</HI> IRELAND, <HI>and for no Other that ever was, is, or, I think, ever can be upon Earth.</HI> Therefore let no Man talk to me of other Expedients: <HI>Of taxing our Ab&s;entees at five Shillings a Pound: Of u&s;ing neither Cloaths, nor Hou&s;hold Furniture, except what is of our own Growth and Manufacture: Of utterly re|jecting the Materials and In&s;truments that promote Foreign Luxury: Of curing the Expen&s;ivene&s;s of Pride, Vanity, Idlene&s;s, and Gameing in our Wo|men: Of introducing a Vein of Parcimony, Prudence and Temperance: Of learning to love our Country, wherein we differ even from</HI> LAPLANDERS,
<PB N="136" REF="136">
<HI>and the Inhabitants of</HI> TOPINAMBOO: <HI>Of quitting our Animo&s;ities, and Factions, nor act any longer like the</HI> Jews, <HI>who were murdering one an|other at the very moment their City was taken: Of being a little cautious not to &s;ell our Country and Con|&s;ciences for nothing: Of teaching Landlords to have at lea&s;t one Degree of Mercy towards their Tenants,</HI> La&s;tly, <HI>Of putting a Spirit of Hone&s;ty, Indu&s;try, and Skill into our Shop-keepers, who, if a Re&s;olution, could now be taken to buy only our Native Goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the Price, the Mea&s;ure, and the Goodne&s;s, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair Propo&s;al of ju&s;t Dealing, though often and earne&s;tly invited to it.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore I repeat, let no Man talk to me of the&s;e and the like Expedients, 'till he hath at lea&s;t &s;ome Glimp&s;e of Hope, that there will ever be &s;ome hearty and &s;incere Attempt to put <HI>them in Practice.</HI></P>
<P>But, as to my &s;elf, having been wearied out for many Years with offering vain, idle, vi&s;ionary Thoughts, and at length utterly de&s;paring of Suc|ce&s;s, I fortunately fell upon this Propo&s;al, which, as it is wholly new, &s;o it hath &s;omething Solid and Real, of no Expence and little Trouble, full in our own Power, and whereby we can incur no Danger in <HI>di&s;obliging</HI> ENGLAND. For this kind of Commodity will not bear Exportation, the Fle&s;h being of too tender a Con&s;i&s;tence, to admit a long Continuance in Salt, <HI>although perhaps I could name a Country, which would be glad to eat up our whole Nation without it.</HI></P>
<P>After all, I am not &s;o violently bent upon my
<PB N="137" REF="137">
own Opinion, as to reject any Offer, propo&s;ed by wi&s;e Men, which &s;hall be found equally innocent, cheap, ea&s;y, and effectual. But before &s;omething of that Kind &s;hall be advanced in Contradiction to my Scheme, and offering a better, I de&s;ire the Author or Authors, will be plea&s;ed maturely to con&s;ider two Points. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As things now &s;tand, how they will be able to find Food and Raiment for a hundred Thou&s;and u&s;ele&s;s Mouths and Backs. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> There being a round Million of Crea|tures in Humane Figure, throughout this King|dom, who&s;e whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence put into a common Stock, would leave them in Debt two Millions of Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> adding tho&s;e, who are Beggars by Profe&s;&s;ion, to the Bulk of Farmers, Cottagers and Labourers, with their Wives and Children, who are Beggars in effect; I de&s;ire tho&s;e Politi|cians, who di&s;like my Overture, and may perhaps be &s;o bold to attempt an An&s;wer, that they will fir&s;t ask the Parents of the&s;e Mortals, Whether they would not at this Day think it a great Happine&s;s to have been &s;old for Food at a Year old, in the man|ner I pre&s;cribe, and thereby have avoided &s;uch a perpetual Scene of Misfortunes, as they have &s;ince gone through, by the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion of Landlords,</HI> the Impo&s;&s;ibility of paying Rent without Money or Trade, the Want of common Su&s;tenance, with neither Hou&s;e nor Cloaths to cover them from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and the mo&s;t ine|vitable Pro&s;pect of intailing the like, or greater Mi&s;eries upon their Breed for ever.</P>
<P>I pro&s;e&s;s in the Sincerity of my Heart, that I have not the lea&s;t Per&s;onal Intere&s;t in endeavouring to promote this nece&s;&s;ary Work, having no other
<PB N="138" REF="138">
Motive than the <HI>Publick Good of my Country, by ad|vancing our Trade, providing for Infants, relieving the Poor, and giving &s;ome plea&s;ure to the Rich.</HI> I have no Children, by which I can propo&s;e to get a &s;ingle Penny; the younge&s;t being nine Years Old, and my Wife pa&s;t Child-boaring.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> THE Lord <HI>CARTERET,</HI> From the CHARGE of favouring <HI>Tories, High-Church-Men,</HI> and <HI>Jacobites.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN order to treat this important Subject with the greate&s;t Fairne&s;s and Impartiality, perhaps it may be convenient to give &s;ome Account of his Excellency, in who&s;e Life and Character there are certain Particulars which might &s;ugge&s;t a very ju&s;t Su&s;picion of &s;ome Truth in the Accu&s;ation he lies under.</P>
<P>He is de&s;cended from two noble, ancient, and mo&s;t loyal Families, the <HI>Carterets</HI> and the <HI>Gran|villes,</HI> too much di&s;tingui&s;hed, I confe&s;s, for
<PB N="140" REF="140">
what they acted, and what they &s;uffered in de|fending the former Con&s;titution in Church and State, under King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr; I mean that very Prince, on Account of who&s;e Martyr|dom <HI>a Form of Prayer with Fa&s;ting was enjoin'd by Act of Parliament, to be u&s;ed on the Thirtieth Day of</HI> January <HI>every Year, to implore the Mercies of God, that the Guilt of that &s;acred and innocent Blood,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>might not be vi&s;ited on us or our Po&s;te|rity,</HI> as we may read at large in our <HI>Common-Prayer-Books,</HI> which Day hath been &s;olemnly kept, even within the Memory of many Men now alive.</P>
<P>His Excellency the pre&s;ent Lord, was educa|ted in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford;</HI> from thence, with a Singularity &s;carce to be ju&s;tified, he carri|ed away more <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and Philo&s;ophy, than properly became a Per&s;on of his Rank; in|deed, much more of each, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are forc'd to live by their Learning, will be at the unnece&s;&s;ary Pains to load their Heads with.</P>
<P>This was the Rock he &s;plit on upon his fir&s;t Appearance in the World, ju&s;t got clear of his Guardians. For as &s;oon as he came to Town, &s;ome Bi&s;hops and Clergymen, and other Per&s;ons mo&s;t eminent for Learning and Parts, got him among them, from whom, though he were fortunately dragg'd by a Lady and the Court, yet he could never wipe off the Stain, nor wa&s;h out the Tincture of his Univer&s;ity Acquirements and Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>To this another Mi&s;sortune was added, That it plea&s;ed God to endow him with great natural
<PB N="141" REF="141">
Talents, Memory, Judgment, Comprehen&s;ion, Eloquence, and Wit; and to fini&s;h the Work, all the&s;e were fortify'd, even in his Youth, with the advantages received by &s;uch Employments, as are be&s;t fitted, both to exerci&s;e and poli&s;h the Gifts of Nature and Education, having been Amba&s;&s;ador in &s;everal Courts, when his Age would hardly allow him to take a Degree, and made Principal Secretary of State at a Period, when, according to Cu&s;tom, he ought to have been bu&s;ied in losing his Money at a Chocolate|hou&s;e, or in other Amu&s;ements, equally laudable and epidemick among Per&s;ons of Honour.</P>
<P>I cannot omit another weak Side in his Excel|lency, for it is known, and can be proved upon him, that <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Books might be found every Day in his Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, if it were care|fully &s;earched; and there is Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;ome of the &s;aid Books have been privately convey'd to him by <HI>Tory</HI> Hands. I am likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured, that he hath been taken in the very Fact of reading the &s;aid Books, even in the mid&s;t of a Se&s;&s;ion, to the great Neglect of publick Affairs.</P>
<P>I own, there may be &s;ome Grounds for this Charge, becau&s;e I have it from good Hands, that when his Excellency is at Dinner with one or two Scholars at his Elbows, he grows a mo&s;t in&s;upport|able and unintelligible Companion to all the &s;ine Gentlemen round the table.</P>
<P>I cannot deny, that his Excellency lies under another great Di&s;advantage; for be&s;ides all the Accompli&s;hments abovementioned, having that of a mo&s;t comely and graceful Per&s;on, he hath, du|ring the Prime of Youth, Spirits and Vigour, in
<PB N="142" REF="142">
a mo&s;t exemplary Manner led a regular, dome|&s;tick Life, di&s;cover'd a great E&s;teem, Friend&s;hip and Love for his Lady, as well as a true Affection for his Children: And when he is di&s;pos'd to ad|mit an entertaining Evening Companion, he doth not always enough reflect whether the Per&s;on may po&s;&s;ibly in former Days have lain under the Impu|tation of a <HI>Tory?</HI> Nor at &s;uch Times do the natu|ral or affected Fears of <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender</HI> make any Part of the Conver&s;ation: I pre&s;ume, becau&s;e neither <HI>Homer, Plato, Ari&s;totle,</HI> nor <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> have made any mention of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e I freely acknowledge to be his Excellen|cy's Failings; yet, I think, it is agreed by Phi|lo&s;ophers and Divines, that &s;ome Allowance ought to be given to human Infirmity, and the Prejudices of a wrong Education.</P>
<P>I am well aware how much my Sentiments differ from the orthodox Opinion of one or two principal Patriots; for the&s;e have decided the Matter directly again&s;t me, by declaring, that no Per&s;on, who was ever known to lie under the Su&s;|picion of one &s;ingle <HI>Tory</HI> Principle, or who had been once &s;een at a great Man's Levee in the <HI>wor&s;t of Times,</HI> &s;hould be allow'd to come within the Verge of the Ca&s;tle; much le&s;s to bow in the Anti-Chamber, appear at the <HI>A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> or dance at a Birth-Night. However, I dare a&s;&s;ert, that this Maxim hath been often controul'd, and that, on the contrary, a con&s;iderable Number of <HI>early Penitents</HI> have been received into Grace, who are now an <HI>Ornament, Happine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Sup|port</HI> to the Nation.</P>
<P>Neither do I find any Murmuring on &s;ome
<PB N="143" REF="143">
other Points of greater Importance, where this favourite Maxim is not &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>To in&s;tance only in one. I have not heard that any Care hath hitherto been taken to di&s;cover whether <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A famous Rope-dancer.</NOTE>Madam <HI>Violante</HI> be a <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory</HI> in her Principles, or even that &s;he hath ever been <HI>offer'd the Oaths to the Governmem t;</HI> on the con|trary, I am told, that &s;he openly profe&s;&s;eth her|&s;elf to be a <HI>High-Flyer;</HI> and it is not improbable, but by her <HI>Outlandi&s;h</HI> Name &s;he may al&s;o be a <HI>Pa|pi&s;t</HI> in her Heart. Yet we &s;ee this illu &s;trious and dangerous Female openly care&s;s'd by principal Per|&s;ons of both Parties, who contribute to &s;upport her in a &s;plendid Manner, without the lea&s;t Ap|prehen&s;ions from a <HI>Grand Jury.</HI> And as <HI>Hobbs</HI> wi&s;e|ly ob&s;erves, <HI>&s;o much Money</HI> being equivalent to <HI>&s;o much Power,</HI> it may de&s;erve con&s;idering with what Safety &s;uch an In&s;trument of <HI>Power</HI> ought to be tru&s;ted in the Hands of an <HI>Alien,</HI> who hath not given any legal Security for her good Affection to the Government.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s there is one Evil, which I could wi&s;h our Friends would think proper to redre&s;s. There are many <HI>Whigs</HI> in this Kingdom of the <HI>old|fa&s;hion'd Stamp,</HI> of whom we might make very good U&s;e; they bear the &s;ame Loyalty with us. to the <HI>Hanoverian</HI> Family, in the Per&s;on of King <HI>George</HI> the Second; the &s;ame Abhorrence of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> with the Con&s;equents of <HI>Popery</HI> and Slavery; and the &s;ame Indulgence to <HI>tender Con|&s;ciences;</HI> but having nothing to ask for them|&s;elves, and con&s;equently the more Lei&s;ure to think for the Publick; they are often apt to en|tertain
<PB N="144" REF="144">
Fears and melancholy Pro&s;pects concer|ning the State of their Country, the Decay of Trade, the Want of Money, the mi&s;erable Con|dition of the People, with other Topicks of like Nature, all which do equally concern both <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> who, if they have any Thing to lo&s;e, mu&s;t be equally Sufferers. Perhaps one or two of the&s;e melanchly Gentlemen will &s;ometimes ven|ture to publi&s;h their Thoughts in Print: Now, I can by no Means approve our u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of cur&s;ing and railing at this Species of Thinkers, un|der the Names of <HI>Tories, Jacobites, Papi&s;ts, Li|bellers, Rebels,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>This was the utter Ruin of that poor, angry, bu&s;tling, well-meaning Mortal <HI>Pi&s;torides,</HI> who lies equally under the Contempt of both Parties, with no other Difference than a Mixture of <HI>Pity</HI> on one Side and of <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>How hath he been pelted, pe&s;ter'd and pounded by one &s;ingle Wag, who promi&s;eth never to for|&s;ake him living or dead.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with the Humour of a <HI>Sur|geon</HI> in this Town, who, having in his own Ap|prehen&s;ions received &s;ome great Inju&s;tice from the Earl of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and de&s;paring of Revenge, as well as Relief, declared to all his Friends, that he had &s;et apart a hundred Guineas to purcha&s;e the Earl's Carca&s;s from the Sexton, whenever I T &s;hould die, to make a Skeleton of the Bones, &s;tuff the Hide, and &s;hew them for three Pence; and thus get Vengeance for the Injuries he had &s;uffer'd by the owner.</P>
<P>Of the like Spirit too often is that implacable Race of Wits, again&s;t whom there is no Defence
<PB N="145" REF="145">
but Innocence and Philo&s;ophy, neither of which is likely to be at Hand, and therefore the Wound|ed have no where to fly for a Cure, but to down|right Stupidity, a crazed Head, or a profligate Contempt of Guilt and Shame.</P>
<P>I am therefore &s;orry for that other mi&s;erable Creature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d V<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t</HI> A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n, who &s;poke again&s;t the Libel in the Privy Council, and likewi&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE><HI>Traulus,</HI> who altho' of &s;omewhat a dif|ferent Species, yet &s;eems very far to out-do even the Genius of <HI>Pi&s;torides</HI> in that mi&s;carrying Talent of Railing without Con&s;i&s;tency or Di&s;cretion, again&s;t the mo&s;t innocent Per&s;ons, according to the pre&s;ent Situation of his Gall and Spleen.

<P>In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, what a Scene would be laid open? And to drop my Metaphor, what a Cha|racter of our mi&s;taken Friend might an angry Enemy draw and expo&s;e? Particularizing that unnatural Conjunction of Vices and Follies &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent with each other in the &s;ame Brea&s;t: Furious and fawning, &s;currilous and flattering, cowardly and provoking, in&s;olent and abject; mo&s;t profligately &s;al&s;e, with the &s;tronge&s;t Profe&s;|&s;ions of Sincerity; po&s;itive and variable, tyran|nical and &s;lavi&s;h.</P>

<P>But it may be objected, that there is an Argu|ment of much more Force to excu&s;e the Over|flowings of that zeal which our <HI>Friend</HI> &s;hews or means for our Cau&s;e.

<P>It is u&s;ual for Ma&s;ters to make their Boys de|claim on both Sides of an Argument; and as &s;ome kinds of A&s;&s;emblies are called the <HI>Schools of Principles,</HI> I confe&s;s nothing can better improve political School-Boys, than the Art of making plau&s;ible or implau&s;ible Harangues again&s;t the very Opinion for which they re&s;olve to determine.</P>

Here is a Per&s;on &s;ent to govern <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e unfortunate weak Side it happens to be, for &s;e|veral Rea&s;ons abovemention'd, that he hath en|couraged the Attendance of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> Gentle|men di&s;tingui&s;hed for their Ta&s;te, their Wit, and their Learning; who have taken the Oaths to his Maje&s;ty, and pray heartily for him; yet, becau&s;e they may perhaps be &s;tigmatized as <HI>quondam</HI> Tories by <HI>Pi&s;torides</HI> and his Gang, his Excellency mu&s;t be forced to bani&s;h them under the Pain and Peril of di&s;plea&s;ing the Zea|lots of his own Party, and thereby, be put into a wor&s;e Condition than every common Good|fellow; who may be a &s;incere <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and a loyal Subject; and yet rather chu&s;e to drink fine Ale at the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Head,</HI> than muddy at the <HI>King</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Let me then return to my Suppo&s;ition. It is certain, the High-flown Loyali&s;ts in the <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word, have their Thoughts, and Studies, and Tongues, &s;o entirely diverted by political Schemes, that the Zeal of their <HI>Principles</HI> hath <HI>eaten up</HI> their Under&s;tandings; neither have they Time from their Employ|ments, their Hopes, and their hourly Labours, for acquiring new Additions of Merit; to amu&s;e them&s;elves with philological Conver&s;e, or Specu|lations which are utterly ruinous to all Schemes of ri&s;ing in the World: What mu&s;t then a Great Man do, who&s;e ill Stars have fatally per|verted him to a Love, and Ta&s;te, and Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion

Our thorough-&s;ped Republick of <HI>Whigs,</HI> which contains the Bulk of all <HI>Hopers, Pretenders, Expectors</HI> and <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,</HI> are, beyond all Doubt, mo&s;t <HI>highly u&s;eful</HI> to Princes, to Govenours, to great Mini&s;ters, and to their Country; but at the &s;ame Time, and by nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, the mo&s;t di&s;agreable Companions to all who have that unfortunate Turn of Mind peculiar to his Excellency, and perhaps to five or &s;ix more in a Nation.</P>
<P>I do not deny it po&s;&s;ible, that an Original or Pro&s;elyte Favourer of the Times might have been born to the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s Talents, which in for|mer Ages qualified a Man to be a Poet, or a Philo&s;opher. All I contend for is, that where the true Genius of Party once enters, it <HI>&s;weeps the Hou&s;e clean,</HI> and leaves Room for many <HI>other Spirits,</HI> to take joint Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion 'till the <HI>la&s;t State of that Man is exceedingly better than the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I allow it a great Error in his Excellency, that he adheres &s;o ob&s;tinately to his old unfa|&s;hionable academick Education: Yet &s;o per|ver&s;e is human Nature, that the u&s;ual Reme|dies for this Evil in others, have produced a contrary Effect in him; to a Degree that I am credibly informed, he will, as I have already hinted, in the Middle of a Se&s;&s;ion, quote Pa&s;|&s;ages out of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Pindar</HI> at his own Ta|ble to &s;ome <HI>Book-learn'd</HI> Companion without Blu&s;hing, even when Per&s;ons of <HI>great Stations</HI> are by.</P>
<P>I will venture one Step farther, which is, freely to confe&s;s, that this mi&s;taken Method of
<PB N="150" REF="150">
educating Youth in the Knowledge of ancient Learning and Language, is too apt to &s;poil their <HI>Politicks</HI> and <HI>Principles?</HI> becau&s;e, the Doctrine and Examples of the Books they read, teach them Le&s;&s;ons <HI>directly contrary in every Point</HI> to the <HI>pre&s;ent Practice</HI> of the World: And ac|cordingly, <HI>Hobbes</HI> mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that the Writings of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> made young Men imbibe Opinions again&s;t <HI>ab|&s;olute Power</HI> in a <HI>Prince,</HI> or even in a fir&s;t <HI>Mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> and to embrace Notions of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been therefore a great Felicity to the&s;e Kingdoms, that the Heirs to Titles and large E&s;tates have a Weakne&s;s in their Eyes, and a Tenderne&s;s in their Con&s;titutions, are not able to bear the Pain and Indignity of Whip|ping, and, as the Mother rightly expre&s;&s;es it, could never take to their Books; yet are well enough qualified to &s;ign a Receipt for half a Year's Rent, to put their Name <HI>(rightly &s;pelt)</HI> to a Warrant, and to read Pamphlets again&s;t <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>High-Flying;</HI> whereby they fill their Niches, and carry them&s;elves through the World with that Dignity which be&s;t becomes a Senator, and a <HI>Squire.</HI></P>
<P>I could heartily wi&s;h his Excellency would be more conde&s;cending to the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Kingdom he Governs, to the Condition of the Times, and to the Nature of the Station he &s;ills. Yet if it be true, what I have read in old <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Story-Books, that one <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> (no Matter to the Bulk of my Readers whether I &s;pell the Name right or wrong) was caught by the <HI>Par&s;on</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="151">
<HI>of the Pari&s;h,</HI> riding on a Hobby-Hor&s;e with his Children; that <HI>Socrates</HI> a <HI>Heathen</HI> Philo&s;opher was found dancing by him&s;elf at Four&s;core; that a King called <HI>Cae&s;ar Augu&s;tus</HI> (or &s;ome &s;uch Name) u&s;ed to play with Boys, whereof &s;ome might po&s;&s;ibly be Sons of <HI>Tories;</HI> and two great Men called <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius</HI> (I forget their <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Names, and whether they were Poets or Generals,) often play'd at Duck and Drake with &s;mooth Stones on a River: Now, I &s;ay, if the&s;e Facts be true, (and the Book where I found them is in Print) I cannot ima|gine why our mo&s;t zealous Patriots may not a little indulge his Excellency, in an Infirmity which is not mortally Evil, provided he gives no publick Scandal (which is by all Means to be avoided:) I &s;ay, why he may not be indulged twice a Week to conver&s;e with one or two par|ticular Per&s;ons, and let him and them conn over their old <HI>exploded</HI> Readings together, after Mornings &s;pent in hearing and pre&s;cribing Ways and Means from and to his <HI>mo&s;t obedient</HI> Politicians for the Welfare of the Kingdom; although the &s;aid particular Per&s;on or Per&s;ons may not have made &s;o publick a Declaration of their political Faith in all its Parts, as the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Nation requires; &s;till &s;ubmitting my Opinion to that <HI>happy Majority,</HI> which I am confident is <HI>always in the right;</HI> by whom the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Subject hath been &s;o frequently, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully a&s;&s;erted; who by their wi&s;e Councils have made <HI>Commerce</HI> to flouri&s;h, <HI>Money</HI> to abound, <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to in|crea&s;e,

<P>But in order to clear his Excellency more fully from this Accu&s;ation of &s;hewing his Fa|vours to <HI>High-flyers, Tories</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to come to Particulars.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Per&s;on of a <HI>Tory</HI> Denomination, to whom his Excellency gave any Marks of his Fa|vour, was Doctor <HI>Thomas Sheridan.</HI> It is to be ob&s;erved, that this happened &s;o early in his Exellency's Government, as it may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed he had not been informed of that Gentleman's Character upon &s;o <HI>dangerous</HI> an Article. The Doctor being well known and di|&s;tingui&s;h'd for his Skill and Succe&s;s in the Edu|cation of Youth, beyond mo&s;t of his Profe&s;&s;ion for many Years pa&s;t; was recommended to his Excellency on the Score of his Learning, and particularly for his Knowledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, whereof it &s;eems his Excellency is a great Admirer, although for what Rea&s;ons I could never imagine. However it is agreed on all Hands, that his Lord&s;hip was too ea&s;ily pre|vail'd on by the Doctor's Reque&s;t, or indeed rather from the Bia&s;s of his own Nature, to hear a Tragedy acted in that <HI>unknown</HI> Lan|guage by the Doctor's Lads, which was written by &s;ome <HI>Heathen</HI> Author; but whether it con|tained any <HI>Tory</HI> or <HI>High-Church</HI> Principles, mu&s;t be left to the Con&s;ciences of the <HI>Boys,</HI> the <HI>Doctor,</HI> and his Excellency; the only Witne&s;&s;es in this Ca&s;e who&s;e Te&s;timonies can be depended upon.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="153">
It &s;eems, his Excellency (a Thing never to be &s;ufficiently wonder'd at) was &s;o pleas'd with his entertainment, that &s;ome Time after he gave the Doctor a Church Living, to the Value al|mo&s;t of one Hundred Pounds a Year, and made him one of his Chaplains, from an <HI>antiquated</HI> Notion, that good Schoolma&s;ters ought to be encouraged in every Nation profe&s;&s;ing Civility and Religion. Yet his Excellency did not ven|ture to make this bold Step without &s;trong Re|commendations from Per&s;ons of undoubted Principles <HI>fitted to the Times;</HI> who thought them&s;elves bound in Ju&s;tice, Honour and Gra|titude, to do the Doctor a good Office in Re|turn for the Care he had taken of their Chil|dren, or tho&s;e of their Friends. Yet the Ca|ta&s;trophe was terrible; for the Doctor in the Height of his Felicity and Gratitude, going down to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Pari&s;h, and fur|ni&s;hed with a few led Sermons, whereof, as it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Number was very &s;mall, having never &s;erved a Cure in the Church; he &s;topp'd at <HI>Cork</HI> to attend on his Bi&s;hop, and going to Church on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, was, according to the u&s;ual Civility of Country Cler|gymen, invited by the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h to &s;upply the Pulpit. It happened to be the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> happened that Year to light upon a <HI>Sunday:</HI> And it hap|pened, that the Doctor's Text was in the&s;e Words; <HI>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> And la&s;tly, it happened, that &s;ome one Per&s;on of the Congregation, who&s;e Loyalty
<PB N="154" REF="154">
made him watchful upon every Appearance of Danger to his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Govern|ment, when Service was over, gave the Alarm. Notice was immediately &s;ent up to Town, and by the Zeal of one Man, of no large Di|men&s;ions of Body or Mind, &s;uch a clamour was rai&s;ed, that we in <HI>Dublin</HI> could apprehend no le&s;s than an Inva&s;ion by the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who mu&s;t be landed in the South. The Re&s;ult was, that the Doctor mu&s;t be &s;truck out of the Chaplains Li&s;t, and appear no more at the Ca&s;tle. Yet, whether he were then, or be at this Day a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory,</HI> I think is a Secret; only it is manife&s;t, that he is a zealous <HI>Hanoverian,</HI> at lea&s;t in Poetry, and a great Adorer of the pre|&s;ent Royal Family thro' all its Branches; his Friends likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ert, that he had preached this &s;ame Sermon often, under the &s;ame Text; that not having ob&s;erved the Words 'till he was in the Pulpit, and had opened his Notes, as he is a Per&s;on a little ab&s;tracted, he wanted Pre|&s;ence of Mind to change them: And that in the whole Sermon there was not a Syllable relating to Government or Party, or to the Subject of the Day.</P>
<P>In this Incident there &s;eems to have been an Union of Events that will probably never hap|pen again to the End of the World, or at lea&s;t, like the grand Conjunction in the Heavens, which, I think, they &s;ay can arrive but once in twenty Thou&s;and Years.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Gentleman (if I am right in my Chronology) who under the Su&s;picion of a <HI>Tory</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="155">
received &s;ome Favour from his Excellency, is Mr. <HI>James Stopford,</HI> very &s;trongly recommend|ed by the mo&s;t eminent <HI>Whig</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> on the Account of his Learning and Virtue, and other Accompli&s;hments: He had pa&s;s'd the greate&s;t Part of his Youth in clo&s;e Study, or in travelling; and was either not at Home or not at Lei&s;ure to trouble his Thoughts about Party, which I allow to be a great Omi&s;&s;ion; tho' I cannot hone&s;tly place him in the Li&s;t of <HI>Tories,</HI> and therefore think his Excellency may be fair|ly acquitted for making him Vicar of <HI>Fingla&s;s,</HI> worth about one Hundred and fifty Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>The third is Doctor <HI>Patrick Delany;</HI> this Divine lies under &s;ome Di&s;advantage, having in his Youth received many Civilities from a certain Per&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Con&s;tantine Phipps,</HI> Lord Chancellor of Ire|land when Queen <HI>Anne</HI> died.</NOTE> then in a very high Station here, for which Rea&s;on I doubt the Doctor ne|ver <HI>drunk his Confu&s;ion</HI> &s;ince; and what makes the Matter de&s;perate, it is now too late; un|le&s;s our Inqui&s;itors will be content with drinking <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> to his <HI>Memory.</HI> The afore&s;aid emi|nent Per&s;on who was a Judge of all Merit but <HI>Party,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed the Doctor among other Juniors in our Univer&s;ity, for his Learning, Virtue, Di&s;cretion, and good Sen&s;e; but the Doctor was then in too good a Situation at his College to hope or endeavour at a better E&s;ta|bli&s;hment from one who had no Power to give it him.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="156">
Upon the pre&s;ent Lord Lieutenant's coming over, the Doctor was named to his Exdellency by a Friend, among other Clergymen of Di|&s;tinction, as Per&s;ons who&s;e Characters it was proper his Excellency &s;hould know: And by the Truth of which the Giver would be content to &s;tand or fall in his Excellency's Opinion; &s;ince not one of tho&s;e Per&s;ons were in particular Friend&s;hip with the Gentlemen who gave in their Names: By this and &s;ome other Incidents, particularly the Recommendation of the late Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Doctor became known to his Excellency, who&s;e fatal Turn of Mind towards <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> and <HI>outlandi&s;h</HI> Books and Languages, finding, as I conceive, a like Di&s;po&s;ition in the Doctor, was the Cau&s;e of his becoming &s;o dome&s;tick as we are told he is, at the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>Three or four Years ago, the Doctor, grown weary of an Academick Life, for &s;ome Rea|&s;ons be&s;t known to the Managers of the Di&s;ci|pline in that learned Society (which it may not be for their Honour to mention) re&s;olved to leave it, although by the Benefit of his Pupils, and his Senior-fellow&s;hip with all its Perqui&s;ites, he received every Year between nine Hundred and a Thou&s;and Pounds. And a &s;mall Nor|thern Living, in the Univer&s;ity's Donation, of &s;omewhat better than a hundred Pounds a Year, falling at the &s;ame Time with the Chancellor|&s;hip of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> to about equal Value, in the Gi&s;t of his Excellency, the Doctor ventured into the World in a very &s;canty Condition, ha|ving
<PB N="157" REF="157">
&s;quander'd away all his annual Income in a manner, which although perhaps proper enough for a Clergyman without a Family, will not be for the Advantage of his Character to di&s;cover either on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> or at a Bank|er's Shop.</P>
<P>About two Months ago, his Excellency gave the Doctor a Prebend in St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cathe|dral, which being of near the &s;ame Value with either of the two former will add a third Part to his Revenues, after he &s;hall have paid the great Incumbrances upon it; &s;o that he may now be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s of Church Pre&s;erments, in &s;cattered Tythes, three hundred Pounds a Year, in&s;tead of the like Sum of infallible Rents from a &s;enior Fellow&s;hip with the Offices annexed; be&s;ides the Advantage of a free Lodging, and &s;ome other Ea&s;ements. But &s;ince the Doctor hath not in any of his Writings, his Sermons, his Actions, his Di&s;cour&s;e, or his Company, di&s;covered one &s;ingle Principle of either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and that the Lord Lieu|tenant &s;till continues to admit him, I &s;hall bold|ly pronounce him <HI>one of us;</HI> but like a new <HI>Free-Ma&s;on,</HI> who hath not yet learned all the Dialect of the My&s;tery. Neither can he ju&s;tly be accu&s;ed of any <HI>Tory</HI> Doctrines, except per|haps &s;ome among tho&s;e few, with which that <HI>wicked Party</HI> was charged during the Height of their Power, but have been &s;ince transferred for the mo&s;t <HI>&s;olid Rea&s;ons</HI> to the <HI>whole Body</HI> of our firme&s;t Friends. I have now done with the Clergy, and upon the &s;tricte&s;t Examination,
<PB N="158" REF="158">
have not been able to find above one of that Order, again&s;t whom any <HI>Party</HI> Su&s;picion can lie, which is the unfortunate Gentleman Dr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> who by mere Chance-medly &s;hot his own Fortune dead with a &s;ingle Text.</P>
<P>As to the Laity, I can hear of but one Per|&s;on of the <HI>Tory</HI> Stamp, who &s;ince the Beginning of his Excellency's Government, did ever re|ceive any &s;olid Mark of his Favour, I mean Sir <HI>Arthur Ache&s;on,</HI> reported to be an acknow|ledged <HI>Tory,</HI> and, what is almo&s;t as bad, a <HI>Scholar</HI> into the Bargain.

<P>Thus, if Sir <HI>Arthur Ache&s;on</HI> &s;hall have the good Fortune to obtain a Grant of this Barrack, he will receive neat Profit annually from the Crown Eleven Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> to help him in entertaining the Officers, and making Provi&s;ion for his younger Children.</P>

<P><PB N="160" REF="160">

Value of the Favours done by his Excellency to the <HI>true Friends</HI> of their King and Country, and of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be remembered, that although his Excellency cannot be properly &s;aid to be&s;tow Bi&s;hopricks, Commands in the Army, the Place of a Judge, or Commi&s;&s;ioner in the Re|venue, and &s;ome others; yet they are, for the mo&s;t Part, di&s;po&s;ed upon his Recommendation, except where the Per&s;ons are immediately &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> by their Intere&s;t at Court, for which I have allowed large Defalcations in the following Accounts. And it is remarkable that the <HI>only</HI> con&s;iderable Station conferred on a re|puted <HI>Tory</HI> &s;ince his pre&s;ent Excellency's Go|vernment was of this <HI>latter</HI> Kind.</P>
<P>And indeed it is but too remarkable, that in a neighbouring Nation (where that dangerous Denomination of Men is incomparably more numerous, more powerful, and of Con&s;equence more formidable) <HI>real Tories</HI> can often with much le&s;s Difficulty obtain very high Favours from the Government, than their <HI>reputed</HI> Bre|thren can arrive to the lowe&s;t in ours.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE Fates of CLERGYMEN.</HEAD>
<P>THere is no <HI>Talent</HI> &s;o u&s;eful towards ri&s;ing in the World, or which puts Men more out of the Reach of Fortune, than that Quality ge|nerally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the dulle&s;t Sort of People, and is in common Speech called <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> a Species of lower Prudence, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of which, People of the meane&s;t Intellectuals, without any other Qualification, pa&s;s through the World in great Tranquility, and with uni|ver&s;al good Treatment, neither giving nor ta|king Offence. <HI>Courts</HI> are &s;eldom unprovided of Per&s;ons under this Character, on whom, if they happen to be of great Quality, mo&s;t Employ|ments, even the Greate&s;t naturally fall, when Competitors will not agree; and in &s;uch Promo|tions, no Body rejoices or grieves. The Truth of this I could prove by &s;everal In&s;tances, with|in my own Memory (for I &s;ay nothing of the pre&s;ent Times.)</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="165">
And indeed, as Regularity and Forms are of great U&s;e in carrying on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World, &s;o it is very convenient, that Per&s;ons en|dued with this Kind of Di&s;cretion, &s;hould have that Share which is proper to their Talents in the Conduct of Affairs, but by no means to meddle in Matters which require <HI>Genius, Learning, &s;trong Comprehen&s;ion, Quickne&s;s of Conception, Magnanimity, Genero&s;ity, Sagacity,</HI> or any other &s;uperior Gift of human Minds. Becau&s;e this &s;ort of <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> is u&s;ually attend|ed with a &s;trong De&s;ire of Money, and few Scruples about the Way of obtaining it, with &s;ervile Flattery and Submi&s;&s;ion, with a Want of all publick Spirit or Principle, with a perpe|tual wrong Judgment when the Owners come into Power and high Place, how to di&s;po&s;e of Favour and Preferment; having no Mea&s;ure for Merit and Virtue in others, but tho&s;e very Steps by which them&s;elves a&s;cended; nor the lea&s;t Intention of doing Good or Hurt to the Publick, farther than either one or t'other, is likely to be &s;ub&s;ervient to their own Security or Intere&s;t. Thus being void of all Friend&s;hip and Enmity, they never complain nor find Fault with the Times, and indeed never have Rea&s;on to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Men of eminent Parts and Abilities, as well as Virtues, do &s;ometimes ri&s;e in the <HI>Courts,</HI> &s;ometimes in the <HI>Law,</HI> and &s;ometimes, even in the <HI>Church.</HI> Such were the Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and others in our own Times, whom I &s;hall not name; but the&s;e, and
<PB N="166" REF="166">
many more, under different Princes, and in dif|ferent Kingdoms, were <HI>Di&s;graced</HI> or <HI>Bani&s;hed</HI> or <HI>&s;uffered Death,</HI> merely in Envy to their Vir|tues and &s;uperior <HI>Genius,</HI> which emboldened them in great Exigencies and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of State (wanting a rea&s;onable Infu&s;ion of this Aldermanly Di&s;cretion) to attempt the Service of their Prince and Country out of the common Forms.</P>
<P>This evil Fortune, which generally attends extraordinary Men in the Management of great Affairs, hath been imputed to divers Cau&s;es, that need not be here &s;et down, when &s;o obvious an One occurs; if what a certain Writer ob|&s;erves, be true, that <HI>when a great Genius appears in the World, the Dunces are all in Confederacy again&s;t him.</HI> And thus although he employs his <HI>Talents</HI> wholly in his Clo&s;et, without interfering with any Man's Ambition or Avarice; what mu&s;t he expect when he ventures out to &s;eek for Preferment in a Court, but univer&s;al Oppo&s;ition when he is mounting the Ladder, and every Hand ready to turn him off, when he is at the Top? And in this Point Fortune generally acts directly contrary to Nature; for in Nature we find, that Bodies full of Life and Spirits mount ea&s;ily, and are hard to fall, whereas heavy Bodies are hard to ri&s;e, and come down with greater Velocity, in Proportion to their Weight; but we find Fortune every day acting ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of this.</P>
<P>This Talent of <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> as I have de&s;cribed it in its &s;everal Adjuncts and Circum&s;tances, is no where &s;o &s;erviceable as to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> to who&s;e Pre&s;erment nothing is &s;o fatal as the
<PB N="167" REF="167">
Character of Wit, Politene&s;s in Reading, or Manners, or that Kind of Behaviour which we contract by having too much conver&s;ed with Per&s;ons of high Stations and Eminency; the&s;e Qualifications being reckoned by the <HI>Vulgar</HI> of <HI>all Ranks,</HI> to be Marks of <HI>Levity,</HI> which is the la&s;t Crime the World will pardon in a <HI>Cler|gyman:</HI> To this I may add a free Manner of Speaking in mixt Company, and too frequent an Appearance in Places of much Re&s;ort, which are equally noxious, to &s;piritual Promotions.</P>
<P>I have known indeed a few Exceptions to &s;ome Parts of the&s;e Regulations. I have &s;een &s;ome of the dulle&s;t Men alive aiming at Wit, and others with as little Preten&s;ions affecting Politene&s;s in Manners and Di&s;cour&s;e; but never being able to per&s;uade the World of their Guilt, they grew into con&s;iderable Stations, upon the firm A&s;&s;urance which all People had of their <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> becau&s;e they were a Size too low to deceive the World to their own Di&s;advantage. But this I confe&s;s is a Tryal too dangerous often to engage in.</P>
<P>There is a known Story of a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> who was recommended for a Preferment by &s;ome great Men at Court, to an Archbi&s;hop. His Grace, &s;aid he had heard that the <HI>Clergyman</HI> u&s;ed to play at Whisk and Swobbers; that as to playing now and then a &s;ober Game at Whisk for Pa&s;time, it might be pardoned, but he could not dige&s;t tho&s;e wicked Swobbers, and it was with &s;ome Pains that my Lord <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs</HI> could undeceive him. I ask, by what Talents we may &s;uppo&s;e that great Prelate a&s;cend &s;o
<PB N="168" REF="168">
high, or what &s;ort of Qualifications he would expect in tho&s;e whom he took into his Patron|age, or would probably recommend to Court for the Government of <HI>Di&s;tant Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Two <HI>Clergymen</HI> in my Memory &s;tood Candi|dates for a &s;mall <HI>Free-School</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">Shire,</HI> where a Gentleman of Quality and Intere&s;t in the Country, who happened to have a better Un|der&s;tanding than his Neighbours, procured the Place for him who was the better Scholar, and more gentlemanly Per&s;on of the two, very much to the Regret of all the Pari&s;h; the other being di&s;appointed came up to <HI>London,</HI> where he became the greate&s;t Pattern of this lower <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> that I have known, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with as heavy Intellectuals; which toge|ther with the Coldne&s;s of his Temper, and Gravity of his Deportment, carried him &s;afe through many Difficulties, and he lived and died in a great Station, while his Competitor is too ob&s;cure for Fame to tell us what become of him.</P>
<P>This Species of <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> which I &s;o much celebrate, and do mo&s;t heartily recommend, hath one Advantage not yet mentioned, that it will carry a Man &s;afe through all the Malice and Variety of Parties, &s;o far, that whatever Faction happens to be uppermo&s;t, his Claim is u&s;ually allowed for a Share of what is going. And the Thing &s;eems to me highly rea&s;onable: For in all great Changes, the prevailing Side is u&s;ually &s;o tempe&s;tuous, that it wants the Balla&s;t of tho&s;e, whom the World calls <HI>Moderate Men,</HI> and I call <HI>Men of Di&s;cretion,</HI> whom People in
<PB N="169" REF="169">
Power may with little Ceremony load as heavy as they plea&s;e, drive them through the harde&s;t and deepe&s;t Roads without Danger of found'|ring, or breaking their Backs, and will be &s;ure to find them neither ru&s;ty nor vicious.</P>
<P>I will here give the Reader a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of two <HI>Clergymen</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the Characters of each, and the Progre&s;s of their Fortunes in the World; by which the Force of worldly Di&s;cretion, and the bad Con&s;equences from the Want of that Virtue will &s;trongly appear.</P>
<P><HI>Coru&s;odes,</HI> an <HI>Oxford</HI> Student, and a Farmer's Son, was never ab&s;ent from Prayers or Lecture, nor once out of his <HI>College</HI> after <HI>Tom</HI> had toll'd. He &s;pent every Day ten Hours in his Clo&s;et, in reading his Cour&s;es, Dozing, clipping Papers, or darning his Stockings, which la&s;t he per|formed to Admiration. He could be &s;oberly drunk at the Expence of others, with <HI>College</HI> Ale, and at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons was always mo&s;t de|vout. He wore the &s;ame Gown five Years, without dragling or tearing. He never once look'd into a Play-book or a Poem. He read <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ramus</HI> in the &s;ame Cadence, but with a very different Ta&s;te. He never un|der&s;tood a Je&s;t, or had the lea&s;t Conception of Wit.</P>
<P>For one Saying he &s;tands in Renown to this Day. Being with &s;ome other Students over a Pot of Ale, one of the Company &s;aid &s;o many plea&s;ant Things, that the re&s;t were much di|verted, only <HI>Coru&s;odes</HI> was &s;ilent and unmoved. When they parted, he called this merry Com|panion
<PB N="170" REF="170">
a&s;ide, and &s;aid, <HI>Sir, I preceive by your often &s;peaking, and our Friends Laughing, that you &s;poke many Je&s;ts, and you could not but ob&s;erve my Silence. But, Sir, this is my Ho|mour, I never make a Je&s;t my&s;elf, nor ever laugh at another Man's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coru&s;odes</HI> thus endowed got into Holy Orders, having by the mo&s;t extreme Par&s;imony &s;aved thirty four Pounds out of a very beggarly Fel|low&s;hip, went up to <HI>London,</HI> where his Si&s;ter was waiting Woman to a Lady, and &s;o good a Sollicitor, that by her Means he was admitted to read Prayers in the Family twice a Day, at fourteen Shillings a Month. He had now ac|quired a low, ob&s;equious, awkward Bow, and a Talent of gro&s;s Flattery, both in and out of Sea&s;on; he would &s;hake the Butler by the Hand; he taught the Page his <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> and was &s;ometimes admitted to dine at the Stew|ard's Table. In &s;hort, he got the good Word of the whole Family, and was recommended by my Lady for Chaplain to &s;ome other Noble Hou&s;e, by which his Revenue (be&s;ide Vales) amounted to about thirty Pounds a Year; his Si&s;ter procured him a Scarf from my Lord (who had a &s;mall De&s;ign of Gallantry upon her;) and by his Lord&s;hip's Sollicitation he got a Lecture&s;hip in Town of &s;ixty Pounds a Year; where he preached con&s;tantly in Per&s;on, in a grave Manner, with an audible Voice, a Style Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, and the Matter (&s;uch as it was) well &s;uited to the Intellectuals of his Hearers. Some time after a Country Living fell in my Lord's Di&s;po&s;al, and his Lord&s;hip, who had
<PB N="171" REF="171">
now &s;ome Encouragement given him of Succe&s;s in his Amour, be&s;tow'd the Living on <HI>Coru|&s;odes,</HI> who &s;till kept his Lecture&s;hip and Re&s;i|dence in Town, where he was a con&s;tant At|tendant at all Meetings relating to Charity, without ever contributing further than his fre|quent pious Exhortations. If any Women of better Fa&s;hion in the Pari&s;h happened to be ab&s;ent from Church, they were &s;ure of a Vi&s;it from him in a Day or two, to chide and to dine with them.</P>
<P>He had a &s;elect Number of Poor, con&s;tantly attending at the Street Door of his Lodgings, for whom he was a common Sollicitor to his for|mer Patrone&s;s, dropping in his own Half-Crown among the Collections, and taking it out when he di&s;po&s;ed of the Money. At a Per&s;on of Quality's Hou&s;e, he would never &s;it down 'till he was thrice bid, and then upon the Corner of the mo&s;t di&s;tant Chair. His whole Demeanor was formal and &s;tarched, which adhered &s;o clo&s;e, that he could never Shake it off in his highe&s;t Promotion.</P>
<P>His Lord was now in high Employment at Court, and attended by him with the mo&s;t ab|ject A&s;&s;iduity, and his Si&s;ter being gone off with Child to a private Lodging, my Lord continued his Graces to <HI>Coru&s;odes,</HI> got him to be a Chap|lain in Ordinary, and in due Time a Pari&s;h in Town, and a <HI>Dignity in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>He paid his <HI>Curates</HI> punctually, at the lowe&s;t Sallary, and partly out of the Communion-Money; but gave them good Advice in Abun|dance. He married a Citizen's Widow, who
<PB N="172" REF="172">
taught him to put out &s;mall Sums at <HI>Ten per Cent.</HI> and brought him acquainted with Jobbers in <HI>Change-Alley.</HI> By her Dexterity, he &s;old the Clark&s;hip of his Pari&s;h, when it became vacant.</P>
<P>He kept a mi&s;erable Hou&s;e, but the Blame was laid wholly upon <HI>Madam;</HI> for the good Doctor was always at his <HI>Books,</HI> or vi&s;iting the Sick, or doing other Offices of Charity and Pi|ety in his Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>He treated all his Inferiors of the Clergy with a mo&s;t &s;anctified Pride; was rigorou&s;ly and univer&s;ally cen&s;orious upon all his Brethren of the Gown, on their fir&s;t Appearance in the World, or while they continued meanly pre|ferred; but gave large Allowance to the Laiety of high Rank, or great Riches, u&s;ing neither Eyes nor Ears for their Faults: He was never &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t Corruption in <HI>Courts, Par|liaments</HI> or <HI>Mini&s;tries,</HI> but made the mo&s;t fa|vourable Con&s;tructions of all publick Proceed|ings; and Power, in whatever Hands, or what|ever Party, was always &s;ecure of his mo&s;t cha|ritable Opinion. He had many whole&s;ome Maxims ready to excu&s;e all Mi&s;carriages of State; <HI>Men are but Men; Erunt vitia donee homines;</HI> and <HI>Quod &s;upra nos, nil ad nos;</HI> with &s;everal others of equal Weight.</P>
<P>It would lengthen my Paper beyond Mea&s;ure to trace out the whole Sy&s;tem of his Conduct; his dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Popery;</HI> his great Moderation towards Di&s;&s;enters of all De|nominations; with hearty Wi&s;hes, that by yielding &s;omewhat on both Sides, there might
<PB N="173" REF="173">
be a general Union among Prote&s;tants; his &s;hort, inoffen&s;ive Sermons in his Turns at Court, and the Matter exactly &s;uited to the pre&s;ent Juncture of prevailing Opinions. The Arts he u&s;ed to obtain a Mitre, by writing again&s;t Epi&s;|copacy, and the Proofs he gave of his Loyalty, by palliating or defending the Murder of a mar|tyr'd Prince.</P>
<P>Endowed with all the&s;e Accompli&s;hments, we leave him in the full Career of Succe&s;s, mounting fa&s;t towards the Top of the Ladder Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, which he hath a fair Probability to reach, without the Merit of one &s;ingle Vir|tue, moderately &s;tocked with the lea&s;t valuable Parts of Erudition, utterly devoid of all <HI>Ta&s;te, Judgment,</HI> or <HI>Genius,</HI> and in his Grandeur na|turally chu&s;ing to hawl up others after him, who&s;e Accompli&s;hments mo&s;t re&s;emble his own, except his beloved Sons, Nephews, or other Kindred, be not in Competition; or la&s;tly, ex|cept his Inclinations be diverted by tho&s;e who have Power to mortify or further advance him.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio</HI> &s;et out from the &s;ame Univer&s;ity, and about the &s;ame Time with <HI>Coru&s;odes;</HI> he had the Reputation of an arch Lad at School, and was unfortunately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a <HI>Talent</HI> for <HI>Poetry,</HI> on which Account he received many chiding Letters from his Father, and grave Ad|vice from his Tutor. He did not neglect his College Learning, but his chief Study was the Authors of Antiquity, with a perfect Know|ledge in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman Tongues.</HI> He could never procure him&s;elf to be cho&s;en Fel|low; for it was objected again&s;t him, that he 
<PB N="174" REF="174">
had written Ver&s;es, and particularly &s;ome, wherein he glanced at a certain Reverend Doc|tor, famous for Dulne&s;s; That he had been &s;een bowing to Ladies as he met them in the Streets; and it was proved, that once he had been found dancing in a private Family with half a dozen of both Sexes.</P>
<P>He was the younger Son to a Gentleman of a good Birth, but &s;mall Fortune, and his Father dying, he was driven to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;eek his Fortune: He got into Orders, and became Reader in a Pari&s;h-Church at twenty Pounds a Year, was carried by an <HI>Oxford</HI> Friend to <HI>Will</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> frequented in tho&s;e Days by Men of Wit, where, in &s;ome Time, he had the bad Luck to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. His &s;canty Sal|lery compelled him to run deep in Debt for a new Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock, and now and then forced him to write &s;ome Paper of Wit or Humour, or preach a Sermon for ten Shillings, to &s;upply his Nece&s;&s;ities. He was a thou&s;and Times r&eacute;com|mended by his Poetical Friends to great Per&s;ons, as a young Man of excellent Parts, who de&s;erved Encouragement, and received a thou&s;and Pro|mi&s;es; but his Mode&s;ty, and a generous Spirit, which di&s;dained the Slavery of continual Ap|plication and Attendance, always di&s;appointed him, making room for vigilant Dunces, who were &s;ure to be never out of Sight.</P>
<P>He had an excellent Faculty in preaching, if he were not &s;ometimes a little too refined, and apt to tru&s;t too much to his own Way of think|ing and rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="175">
When upon the Vacancy of Preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon &s;ome promi|&s;ing Lord, he received the u&s;ual An&s;wer, that he came too late, for it had been given to ano|ther the very Day before. And he had only this Comfort left, that every Body &s;aid, it was a thou&s;and Pities, &s;omething could not be done for poor Mr. <HI>Eugenio.</HI></P>
<P>The Remainder of his Story will be di&s;|patched in a few Words: Wearied with weak Hopes, and weaker Pur&s;uits, he accepted a Cu|racy in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> of thirty Pounds a Year, and when he was five and forty, had the great Felicity to be prefered by a Friend of his Fa|ther's, to a Vicaridge worth annually &s;ixty Pound, in the mo&s;t de&s;ert Parts of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where, his Spirit quite &s;unk with tho&s;e Reflections that Solitude and Di&s;appointments bring, he married a Farmer's Widow, and is &s;till alive, utterly un|di&s;tingui&s;hed and forgotten, only &s;ome of the Neighbours have accidentally heard, <HI>that he had been a notable Man in his Youth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON <HI>Modern Education.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FROM frequently reflecting upon the Cour&s;e and Method of educating Youth in this and a neighbouring Kingdom, with the ge|neral Succe&s;s and Con&s;equence thereof, I am come to this Determination, That Education is always the <HI>wor&s;e</HI> in Proportion to the <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Grandeur</HI> of the Parents; nor do I doubt in the lea&s;t, that if the whole World were now under the Dominion of <HI>one Monarch</HI> (provided I might be allowed to chu&s;e <HI>where</HI> he &s;hould fix the Seat of his Empire) the only Son and Heir of that Monarch, would be the wor&s;t edu|cated Mortal, that ever was born &s;ince the Crea|tion; and I doubt, the &s;ame Proportion will hold through all Degrees and Titles, from an Emperor downwards, to the common Gentry.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that this hath been always the Ca&s;e; for in better Times it was directly other|wi&s;e, and a Scholar may fill half his <HI>Greek</HI> and
<PB N="177" REF="177">
<HI>Roman</HI> Shelves with Authors of the noble&s;t Birth, as well as highe&s;t Virtue: Nor, do I tax all Nations at pre&s;ent with this Defect, for I know there are &s;ome to be excepted, and parti|cularly <HI>Scotland,</HI> under all the Di&s;advantages of its Climate and Soil, if that Happine&s;s be not rather owing even to tho&s;e very Di&s;advan|tages. What is then to be done, if this Re|flection mu&s;t fix on two Countries, which will be mo&s;t ready to take Offence, and which of all others it will be lea&s;t prudent or &s;afe to offend?</P>
<P>But there is one Circum&s;tance yet more dan|gerous and lamentable: For if, according to the <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> already laid down, the highe&s;t Qua|lity any Youth is of, he is in greater Likely|hood to be wor&s;e educated; it behoves me to dread, and keep far from the Verge of <HI>Scan|dalum Magnatum.</HI></P>
<P>Retracting therefore that hazardous <HI>Po&s;tula|tum,</HI> I &s;hall venture no further at pre&s;ent than to &s;ay, that perhaps &s;ome additional Care in educating the Sons of Nobility and principal Gentry, might not be ill employed. If this be not delivered with Softne&s;s enough, I mu&s;t for the future be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, let me ask only two Que|&s;tions, which relate to <HI>England.</HI> I ask fir&s;t, how it comes about, that for above &s;ixty Years pa&s;t, the chief Conduct of Affairs hath been generally placed in the Hands of <HI>New-men,</HI> with very few Exceptions? The Noble&s;t Blood of <HI>England</HI> having been &s;hed in the grand Re|bellion, many great Families became extinct, or &s;upported only by Minors. When the King
<PB N="178" REF="178">
was re&s;tored, very few of tho&s;e Lords remained, who began, or at lea&s;t had improved their Edu|cation, under the happy Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> or King <HI>Charles</HI> I. of which Lords the two principal were the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> The Minors have, or had, during the Rebellion and U&s;urpation, either received too much Tincture of bad Prin|ciples from tho&s;e fanatick Times, or coming to Age at the Re&s;toration, fell into the Vices of that di&s;&s;olute Reign.</P>
<P>I date from this Aera, the corrupt Method of Education among us, and the Con&s;equence thereof, in the Nece&s;&s;ity the Crown lay under of introducing <HI>New-men</HI> into the chief Conduct of publick Affairs, or to the Office of what we now call Prime Mini&s;ters, Men of Art, Know|ledge, Application and In&s;inuation, merely for Want of a Supply among the Nobility. They were generally (though not always) of good Birth, &s;ometimes younger Brothers, at other Times &s;uch, who, although inheriting good E&s;tates, yet happened to be well educated, and provided with Learning; &s;uch under that King, were <HI>Hyde, Bridgeman, Clifford, Osborn, Go|dolphin, A&s;hley-Cooper:</HI> Few or none under the &s;hort Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. Under King <HI>William; Sommers, Mountague, Churchil, Vernon, Boyle,</HI> and many others: Under the Queen; <HI>Harley, St. John, Harcourt, Tre|vor,</HI> who indeed were Per&s;ons of the be&s;t pri|vate Families, but unadorn'd with Titles. So in the following Reign, Mr. <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> was for many Years Prime Mini&s;ter, in which

Po&s;t he &s;till happily continues: His Brother <HI>Horace</HI> is Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary to <HI>France.</HI> Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> without the lea&s;t Allowance to &s;upport them, have been Secre|taries of State.</P>
<P>If the Facts have been thus for above &s;ixty Years pa&s;t (whereof I could with a little fur|ther Recollection produce many more In&s;tances) I would ask again, how it hath happened, that in a Nation plentifully abounding with Nobility, &s;o great Share in the mo&s;t competent Parts of publick Management, hath been for &s;o long a Period chiefly entru&s;ted to Commoners, unle&s;s &s;ome Omi&s;&s;ions or Defects of the highe&s;t Im|port, may be charged upon tho&s;e, to whom the Care of educating our Noble Youth had been committed? For, if there be any Diffe|rence between human Creatures in the Point of natural Parts, as we u&s;ually call them, it &s;hould &s;eem, that the Advantage lies on the Side of Children, born from noble and wealthy Parents; the &s;ame traditional Sloth and Luxury which render their Body weak and effeminate, per|haps refining and giving a freer Motion to the Spirits, beyond what can be expected from the gro&s;s, robu&s;t I&s;&s;ue of meaner Mortals. Add to this, the peculiar Advantages, which all young Noblemen po&s;&s;e&s;s, by the Privileges of their Birth. Such as a free Acce&s;s to Courts, and a univer&s;al deference paid to their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> chargeth it for a Fault on Princes, that they are impatient to compa&s;s <HI>Ends,</HI> without giving them&s;elves the Trouble of con&s;ulting or executing the <HI>Means:</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="180">
So, perhaps, it may be the Di&s;po&s;ition of young Nobles, either from the Indulgence of Parents, Tutors and Governors, or their own Inactivity, that they expect the <HI>Accompli&s;hments</HI> of a good Education, without the lea&s;t Expence of <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Study,</HI> to acquire them.</P>
<P>What I &s;aid la&s;t, I am ready to retract; for the Ca&s;e is infinitely wor&s;e; and the very Max|ims &s;et up to direct modern Education, are enough to de&s;troy all the Seeds of Knowledge, Honour, Wi&s;dom and Virtue among us. The current Opinion prevails, that the Study of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> is Lo&s;s of Time; that publick Schools, by mingling the Sons of Noblemen with tho&s;e of the Vulgar, engage the former in bad Company; that Whipping breaks the Spirits of Lads well born; that Univer&s;ities make young Men Pedants; that to dance, fence, &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> and know how to behave your|&s;elf among great Per&s;ons of both Sexes, com|prehends <HI>the whole Duty of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but think this wi&s;e Sy&s;tem of Edu|cation, hath been much cultivated among us by tho&s;e Worthies of the Army, who during the la&s;t War, returning from <HI>Flanders</HI> at the Clo&s;e of each Campaign, became the Dictators of Behaviour, Dre&s;s, and Politene&s;s, to all tho&s;e Young&s;ters, who frequent Chocolate-Coffee-Gaming-Hou&s;es, Drawing-Rooms, Opera's, Levees and A&s;&s;emblies; where a Colonel by his Pay, Perqui&s;ites and Plunder, was qualified to out&s;hine many Peers of the Realm; and by the Influence of an <HI>exotick</HI> Habit and Demea|nor, added to other foreign Accompli&s;hments,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
gave the Law to the whole Town, and was co|pyed as the Standard-Pattern of whatever was refined in Dre&s;s, Equipage, Conver&s;ation, or Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>I remember in tho&s;e Times, an admired Original of that Vocation, &s;itting in a Coffee|hou&s;e near two Gentlemen, whereof one was of the Clergy, who were engaged in &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e that &s;avoured of Learning; this Officer thought fit to interpo&s;e, and profe&s;&s;ing to deli|ver the Sentiments of his Fraternity, as well as his own (and probably did &s;o of too many among them) turning to the Clergy-Man, &s;poke in the following Manner, <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n me, Doctor, &s;ay what you will, the Army is the only School for Gentlemen.

After which he proceeded with a Volley of Military Terms, le&s;s &s;ignificant, &s;ounding wor&s;e, and harder to be under&s;tood than any that were ever coined by the Commentators upon <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> I would not here be thought to charge the Soldiery with Ignorance and Contempt of Learning, without allowing Exceptions, of which I have known many; but however, the wor&s;e Example, e&s;pe|cially in a great Majority, will certainly prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="182">
I have heard, that the late Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the Time of his Mini&s;try, never pa&s;s'd by <HI>White</HI>'s <HI>Chocolate-Hou&s;e</HI> (the common Rendez|vous of infamous Sharpers, and Noble Cullies) without be&s;towing a Cur&s;e upon that famous Academy, as the Bane of half the <HI>Engli&s;h No|bility.</HI> I have likewi&s;e been told another Pa&s;|&s;age concerning that great Mini&s;ter, which, be|cau&s;e it gives a humorous Idea of one principal Ingredient in modern Education, take as fol|loweth. <HI>Le Sack,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> Dancing|ma&s;ter, in great Admiration, asked a Friend, whether it were true, that Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was made an Earl and Lord Trea&s;urer? And finding it confirmed, &s;aid; <HI>Well, I wonder what the De|vil the Queen could &s;ee in him; for I attended him two Years, and he was the greate&s;t Dunce that ever I taught.</HI></P>
<P>Another Hindrance to good Education, and I think the greate&s;t of any, is that pernicious Cu|&s;tom in rich and noble Families, of entertaining <HI>French</HI> Tutors in their Hou&s;es. The&s;e wretch|ed <HI>Pedagogues</HI> are enjoyned by the Father, to take &s;pecial Care that the Boy &s;hall be perfect in his <HI>French;</HI> by the Mother, that <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> mu&s;t not walk 'till he is hot, nor be &s;uffered to play with other Boys, nor be wet in his Feet, nor daub his Cloaths, and to &s;ee the Dancing|ma&s;ter attends con&s;tantly, and does his Duty; &s;he further in&s;i&s;ts, that the Child be not kept too long poring on his Book, becau&s;e he is &s;ub|ject to &s;ore eyes, and of a weakly Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Methods, the young Gentleman is in every Article as fully accompli&s;hed at eight
<PB N="183" REF="183">
Years old as at eight and twenty, Age adding only to the Growth of his Per&s;on and his Vice; &s;o that if you &s;hould look at him in his Boy|hood through the magnifying End of a Per&s;pec|tive, and in his Manhood through the other, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;py any Difference; the &s;ame Airs, the &s;ame Strutt, the &s;ame Cock of his Hat, and Po&s;ture of his Sword, (as far as the Change of Fa&s;hions will allow) the &s;ame Under&s;tanding, the &s;ame Compa&s;s of Know|ledge, with the very &s;ame Ab&s;urdity, Impudence and Impertinence of Tongue.</P>
<P>He is taught from the Nur&s;ery, that he mu&s;t inherit a great E&s;tate, and hath no need to mind his Book, which is a Le&s;&s;on he never forgets to the End of his Life. His chief So|lace is to &s;teal down and play at Span-farthing with the Page, or young Black-a-moor, or little favourite Foot-Boy, one of which is his prin|cipal Confident and Bo&s;om-Friend.</P>
<P>There is one young Lord in this Town, who, by an unexampled Piece of good Fortune, was miraculou&s;ly &s;natched out of the Gulph of Ig|norance, confined to a publick School for a due Term of Years, well whipped when he de&s;erved it, clad no better than his Comrades, and al|ways their Play-Fellow on the &s;ame Foot, had no Precedence in the School, but what was given him by his Merit, and lo&s;t it whenever he was negligent. It is well known how many Mu|tinies were bred at this unprecedented Treat|ment, what Complaints among his <HI>Relations,</HI> and other <HI>Great Ones</HI> of both Sexes; that his Stockings with &s;ilver Clocks were ravi&s;h'd from
<PB N="184" REF="184">
him; that he wore his own Hair; that his Dre&s;s was undi&s;tingui&s;hed; that he was not fit to appear at a Ball or A&s;&s;embly, nor &s;uffered to go to either: And it was with the utmo&s;t Diffi|culty, that he became qualified for his pre&s;ent Removal, where he may probably be farther per&s;ecuted, and po&s;&s;ibly with Succe&s;s, if the Firmne&s;s of a very worthy Governor, and his own good Di&s;po&s;itions will not pre&s;erve him. I confe&s;s, I cannot but wi&s;h he may go on in the Way he began, becau&s;e I have a Curio&s;ity to know by &s;o &s;ingular an Experiment, whether Truth, Honour, Ju&s;tice, Temperance, Cou|rage, and good Sen&s;e, acquired by a <HI>School</HI> and <HI>College</HI> Education, may not produce a very tolerable Lad, although he &s;hould happen to fail in one or two of tho&s;e Accompli&s;hments, which in the general Vogue are held &s;o impor|tant to the fini&s;hing of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>It is true, I have known an Academical Edu|cation to have been exploded in publick A&s;|&s;emblies; and have heard more than one or two Per&s;ons of high Rank declare, they could learn nothing more at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> than to drink Ale and &s;moke Tobacco; where|in I firmly believed them, and could have ad|ded &s;ome hundred Examples from my own Ob|&s;ervation in one of tho&s;e Univer&s;ities; but they all were of young Heirs &s;ent thither, only for Form; either from Schools, where they were not &s;uffered by their careful Parents to &s;tay a|bove three Months in the Year; or from under the Management of <HI>French</HI> Family-Tutors, who yet often attended them to their <HI>College,</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="185">
to prevent all Po&s;&s;ibility of their Improvement: But, I never yet knew any one Per&s;on of Quali|ty, who followed his Studies at the Univer&s;ity, and carried away his ju&s;t Proportion of Learn|ing, that was not ready upon all Occa&s;ions to celebrate and defend that Cour&s;e of Education, and to prove a Patron of learned Men.</P>
<P>There is one Circum&s;tance in a learned Edu|cation, which ought to have much Weight, even with tho&s;e who have no Learning at all. The Books read at <HI>School</HI> and <HI>Colleges,</HI> are full of Incitements to Virtue, and Di&s;couragements from Vice, drawn from the wi&s;e&s;t Rea&s;ons, the &s;tronge&s;t Motives, and the mo&s;t influencing Ex|amples. Thus, young Minds are filled early with an Inclination to Good, and an Abhorrence of Evil, both which encrea&s;e in them, accord|ing to the Advances they make in Literature; and, although they may be, and too often are, drawn by the Temptations of Youth, and the Opportunities of a large Fortune, into &s;ome Ir|regularities, when they come forward into the great World, it is ever with Reluctance and Compunction of Mind, becau&s;e their Bya&s;s to Virtue &s;till continues. They may &s;tray &s;ome|times out of Infirmity or Compliance, but they will &s;oon return to the right Road, and keep it always in View. I &s;peak only of tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es, which are too much the Attendants of Youth and warmer Blood; for, as to the Points of Ho|nour, Truth, Ju&s;tice, and other noble Gifts of the Mind, wherein the Temperature of the Body hath no Concern, they are &s;eldom or ever known to be mild.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="186">
I have engaged my &s;elf very unwarily in too copious a Subject for &s;o &s;hort a Paper. The pre|&s;ent Scope I would aim at is to prove, that &s;ome Proportion of human Knowledge appears re|qui&s;ite to tho&s;e, who, by their Birth or Fortune, are called to the making of Laws, and in a &s;ub|ordinate Way to the Execution of them; and that &s;uch Knowledge is not to be obtained without a Miracle, under the frequent, corrupt, and &s;otti&s;h Methods, of educating tho&s;e, who are born to Wealth or Titles. For, I would have it remembered, that I do by no Means confine the&s;e Remarks to young Per&s;ons of Noble Birth; the &s;ame Errors running through all Families, where there is Wealth enough to afford, that their Sons (at lea&s;t the Elde&s;t) may be good for nothing. Why &s;hould my Son be a Scholar, when it is not intended that he &s;hould live by his Learning? By this Rule, if what is commonly &s;aid be true, that Money an|&s;wereth all Things, why &s;hould my Son be ho|ne&s;t, temperate, ju&s;t, or charitable, &s;ince he hath no Intention to depend upon any of the&s;e Qualities for a Maintenance?</P>
<P>When all is done, perhaps, upon the Whole, the Matter is not &s;o bad as I would make it; and God, who worketh Good out of Evil, act|ing only by the ordinary Cau&s;e and Rule of Na|ture, permits this continual Circulation of hu|man Things for his own un&s;earchable Ends. The Father grows rich by Avarice, Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion; he is a Tyrant in the Neighbour|hood over Slaves and Beggars, whom he calls his Tenants. Why &s;hould he de&s;ire to have
<PB N="187" REF="187">
Qualities infu&s;ed into his Son, which him&s;elf never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or knew, or found the Want of in the Acqui&s;ition of his Wealth? The Son bred in Sloth and Idlene&s;s, becomes a Spend|thrift, a Cully, a Profligate, and goes out of the World a Beggar, as his Father came in: Thus the former is puni&s;hed for his own Sins, as well as for tho&s;e of the latter. The Dung|hill having rai&s;ed a huge Mu&s;hroom of &s;hort Duration, is now &s;pread to enrich other Mens Lands. It is indeed of wor&s;e Con&s;equence, where noble Families are gone to Decay; be|cau&s;e their Titles and Privileges outlive their E&s;tates: And, Politicians tell us, that nothing is more dangerous to the Publick, than a nume|rous Nobility without Merit or Fortune. But even here, God hath likewi&s;e pre&s;cribed &s;ome Remedy in the Order of Nature, &s;o many great Families coming to an End by the Sloth, Luxury, and abandoned Lu&s;ts, which enervated their Breed through every Succe&s;&s;ion, produ|cing gradually a more effeminate Race, wholly unfit for Propagation.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE INTELLIGENCER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may appear to you perhaps a Thing very unnatural to receive a Complaint from a <HI>Son</HI> again&s;t his <HI>Father;</HI> but the Treatment, which I meet with from mine, is of &s;uch a Na|ture, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me not to com|plain.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know there are three Brethren of us, <HI>George, Patrick,</HI> and <HI>Andrew;</HI> I am the &s;econd, but the la&s;t in Affection with my <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> for which I call Heaven and Earth to Wit|ne&s;s, I never committed any Fault to incur his Di&s;plea&s;ure, or to de&s;erve his Neglect. But &s;o it is, that the be&s;t of Men have often Times been mi&s;led in the Choice of their Minions, and very undi&s;cerning in conferring their Fa|vours where they ought.</P>
<P>If Parents could but once bring them&s;elves to be impartial, it would, beyond all doubt, pro|duce
<PB N="189" REF="189">
a delighful Union in their Children, and be the mo&s;t binding Cement, that could be thought of, to pre&s;erve their Affections; be|cau&s;e an equal Di&s;pen&s;ation of Favours would entirely remove all Cau&s;e of Murmuring, Re|pining, or Envy; and, what is of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence, would &s;ecure the Love and E&s;teem of their Children; whereas a partial Behaviour in Parents mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce the contrary.</P>
<P>But to &s;tate my Ca&s;e, in the be&s;t Manner I can, and with an unbia&s;&s;ed Regard to Truth, I think it fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to give you our Cha|racters, with an Account of my <HI>Father</HI>'s Be|haviour, that you may be the better able to give me your <HI>Advice.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, to begin with my Brother <HI>George.</HI> He was ever a great Lover of his Belly, and formerly u&s;ed to cram him&s;elf with <HI>Beef, Pud|ding,</HI> and <HI>White-Pot;</HI> but for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, he has taken more Delight in new fangled <HI>To&s;s|ups,</HI> and <HI>French Keck-Shaws.</HI> This high Feeding does naturally di&s;po&s;e him to be haugh|ty, &s;tubborn, cholerick and rebellious, in&s;o|much, that be&s;ides his In&s;ults towards others, he is ready upon all Occa&s;ions to fly in his owm <HI>Fa|ther</HI>'s Face, and apt to de&s;pi&s;e every Body but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He is &s;o various in his Opinions, that he is of as many <HI>Religions,</HI> as there are and have been <HI>Sects,</HI> &s;ince the Beginning of <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> but the <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Reformed Church as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> is what he chiefly frequents. He was once a great Admirer of ancient Learning, but he has long &s;ince quitted this, for the
<PB N="190" REF="190">
Reading of <HI>News-Papers, Pamphlets,</HI> and <HI>Modern Languages.</HI> In his younger Years, he was fond of manly Exerci&s;es, &s;uch as <HI>Fencing, Leaping, Boxing, pitching the Bar, Wre&s;tling, Hurling, Foot-ball, Hunting,</HI> &amp;c. but of late he has fallen into a &s;trange and unaccountable Effeminacy, and &s;eems to take Delight in no|thing but <HI>Ma&s;querades, Plays,</HI> and <HI>Italian Opera</HI>'s. He is very fond of <HI>Italian</HI> magnifi|cent Buildings, although entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with our Climate, extravagant in the highe&s;t Degree in purcha&s;ing fine Paintings and Statues, and no le&s;s expen&s;ive in va&s;t exten&s;ive Parks and Gardens, by which Means he has almo&s;t run out all his Fortune.</P>
<P>My younger Brother, <HI>Andrew,</HI> who has Cun|ning enough to outwit the <HI>Devil,</HI> joined with Brother <HI>George</HI> &s;ome Years ago, and they ma|nage &s;o dextrou&s;ly together, that whatever they &s;ay, is a <HI>Law</HI> with my <HI>Father;</HI> however, they are not without their Quarrels now and then; but Brother <HI>Andrew</HI> &s;till comes by the wor&s;t, although he is cautious enough to go always armed, for Brother <HI>George</HI> wears a longer Sword. Brother <HI>Andrew</HI> is not very nice in his Food, but loves fine Cloaths. This I &s;up|po&s;e he has learned abroad; for he is a great Traveller. His chief Studies are <HI>Mathema|ticks</HI> and the <HI>Civil-Law,</HI> in both which he has made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s. As for his <HI>Re|ligion,</HI> although he openly profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a mo&s;t rigid <HI>Fanatick of the Kirk,</HI> yet he is &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected to have a Hankering after <HI>Popery.</HI> He has one eminent bad Quality,
<PB N="191" REF="191">
which is, that he cannot ea&s;ily forgive and for|get. I remember I was once &s;o unfortunate, as to tell a fair <HI>Lady,</HI> (a <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of mine) be|fore his Face, that I would &s;tand by her again&s;t him and all her other Adver&s;aries, which he took heinou&s;ly ill, and has not forgiven me to this Hour, but lies upon the Watch to do me all the ill Offices he can.</P>
<P>I come now to my own Character, in which I &s;hall not conceal nor glo&s;s over my Vices, Er|rors, or Failings, but at the &s;ame Time, I &s;hall not think it incon&s;i&s;tent with Mode&s;ty, to tell you my Virtues.</P>
<P>I have but a &s;mall Fortune, can hardly keep Soul and Body together, yet out of a Regard to my Family, which is very Ancient, I love to make what they call a Figure, upon extraordi|nary Occa&s;ions. And now and then I furni&s;h my Table with Victuals and Liquors of the be&s;t Kinds, which makes my <HI>Father</HI> and Brother <HI>George</HI> think I have got the World in a String. I am kind and ho&s;pitable to Strangers, although they frequently rob my Hou&s;e, and turn my Children to lye in the Barn.</P>
<P>I am &s;o fond of Learning, that I put them to the be&s;t School in the Kingdom, and I plain|ly &s;ee, they will be only the Wi&s;er, but never the Richer for it; becau&s;e my <HI>Father</HI> u&s;es all his Intere&s;t for Brother <HI>George</HI>'s Sons, and the greate&s;t <HI>Dunce</HI> among them &s;hall be better provided for, than the mo&s;t Ingenious of mine. And, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I have &s;ome who are equal in Learning to the be&s;t of his. I had a De&s;ign once, to follow <HI>Merchandi&s;e,</HI> that I might the
<PB N="192" REF="192">
better be able to provide for my poor Children; but Brother <HI>George</HI> having a Mind to make a <HI>Monopoly,</HI> prevailed upon my <HI>Father</HI> to join again&s;t me; and &s;o at la&s;t they contrived it, that I &s;hould &s;ell nothing but a few of my <HI>Cattle,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Linnen-Cloth,</HI> which is all the Support I have; whereas Brother <HI>George</HI> can &s;ell every Thing he has, all the World over; and &s;o cruel is he to me, that he will not let me have even a Bit of his Dirt, if he thinks it will be of any Advantage to me. My <HI>Religion</HI> is of three Sorts, the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hed, Popi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> but I have a greater Share of the fir&s;t in me: I think it is be&s;t, becau&s;e it encourages Obedience to my <HI>Father,</HI> more than either of the other two. It is not long, &s;ince Brother <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> were in a Confederacy again&s;t my <HI>Father,</HI> with an Intent to turn him out of his Hou&s;e, and give another the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; at which critical Juncture, I mu&s;tered up a great Number of my Sons and Servants, to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, for ought I know, &s;aved both his Life and Fortune.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I had like to have been ru|ined by a Project; for one of my Brother <HI>George</HI>'s Family endeavoured to per&s;uade my <HI>Father,</HI> that <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> were of no U&s;e to me, and de&s;ired Leave to furni&s;h me with a few <HI>Counters,</HI> in Lieu thereof; and I fear, I &s;hould have been &s;o weak, as to accept of them, had it not been for the &s;ea&s;onable Remon|&s;trances made by &s;ome of my own <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the many Hard&s;hips I have &s;uffered; notwith&s;tanding all which, I am
<PB N="193" REF="193">
willing to continue in <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> to my dear <HI>Father;</HI> for I have Rea&s;on to be|lieve, that his Unkindne&s;s to me, is owing to ill Advi&s;ers, who have prejudiced him again&s;t me and my Children; but I hope before long he will be able to di&s;tingui&s;h his mo&s;t faithful Son. In the mean Time, I do humbly entreat the Favour of you to write a Letter to my <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> which he may &s;ee in Print, for I fear all my Letters to him hitherto have been inter|cepted.</P>

<P>YOU have not told me your <HI>Father</HI>'s Name, nor his Quality, and therefore I am at a Lo&s;s in what Manner I &s;hould addre&s;s him. But in common Humanity (becau&s;e I think your Ca&s;e deplorable) I will give you what Comfort I am able, together with my be&s;t Advice.</P>
<P>You are not the only In&s;tance of <HI>&s;uffering Innocence,</HI> and therefore it ought not &s;urprze you, that <HI>Providence</HI> (for Rea&s;ons unaccountable to us) has laid two great Tryals in your Way, <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> from your <HI>Brethren,</HI> and <HI>Unkind|ne&s;s</HI> from your <HI>Father,</HI> this too without any Fault on your Side.

State your Ca&s;e and expo&s;tulate with him concerning your own and your Childrens Sufferings. When he hears your Story, and beholds your Sincerity, you may be &s;ure of his Compa&s;&s;ion and a Redre&s;s; for there is no Heart &s;o hard as not to &s;ympa|thize with Real Woe, no Advocate &s;o power|ful as Innocence. In the mean Time, let me con|jure you not to turn a&s;ide to the Right or to the Left, from that indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, which the expre&s;s Laws of God enjoin you, for let me a&s;&s;ure you that Ingratitude to a Parent is, no le&s;s than Rebellion, like the Sin of Witchcraft.</P>
<P>I commit you to his Care and Direction, who is be&s;t able to govern the unruly Af|fections of Men, to turn the Hearts of the Malicious, and to relieve and &s;upport tho&s;e who &s;uffer for the Sake of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Intelligencer,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately, with great Candour and Impartiality, peru&s;ed &s;ome of your <HI>Pa|pers</HI> upon the Di&s;tre&s;s and Poverty of this <HI>I&s;land,</HI> which you take Care to de&s;cribe in the mo&s;t pathetick Manner, you mu&s;t forgive me if I differ from you, and think it one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and wealthy Kingdoms in the whole World. And to &s;upport my Opinion, I will venture to affirm, that there never was &s;uch Affluence in ready Ca&s;h as at this pre&s;ent Juncture: For have we not more <HI>Bankers</HI> than ever were known among us? And whether the
<PB N="196" REF="196">
<HI>Money</HI> circulates in <HI>Specie</HI> or <HI>Paper,</HI> it is the &s;ame Thing to us, &s;ince tho&s;e who would ra|ther have <HI>Ca&s;h</HI> than <HI>Paper,</HI> can (as is well known) have their Choice, whenever they plea&s;e. It is to be pre&s;um'd that no <HI>Banker</HI> gives a NOTE before the <HI>Money</HI> is fir&s;t laid down on his <HI>Counter;</HI> then of Con&s;equence there is as much <HI>Money</HI> as there is <HI>Paper;</HI> and that we have a great deal of <HI>Paper</HI> is mo&s;t certain, therefore a great deal of <HI>Money.</HI> But I will proceed farther, and prove that we have much more <HI>Money</HI> than <HI>Paper,</HI> becau&s;e there are Multitudes who keep their own <HI>Mo|ney.</HI> This appears from the great Number of <HI>Iron Che&s;ts</HI> imported from <HI>Holland</HI> within the&s;e la&s;t <HI>&s;even Years;</HI> for what U&s;e can they be of, but to lodge <HI>Money?</HI> They are at lea&s;t two hundred. We will &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e, one with another, may contain <HI>two thou&s;and Pounds</HI> a piece, then the Sum total amounts to <HI>four hundred thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> which is &s;o much &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary <HI>Ca&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>If this <HI>I&s;land</HI> were not very wealthy, it is &s;trongly to be pre&s;umed, that &s;o many <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>able</HI> Heads, Men of great Learning and &s;uperior Talents, who&s;e Reputations reach'd us from di&s;tant Regions long before they came among us, &s;o well di&s;tingui&s;hed in their own <HI>Coun|tries</HI> for their great Knowledge in their &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, and here more e&s;pecially remarka|ble for their &s;peaking in publick, and their profound Skill in Religion, Politicks and Law: I &s;ay that Men of &s;uch Accompli&s;hments would never quit their own Native Soil, where &s;o
<PB N="197" REF="197">
many E&s;tates are daily made, if they were not &s;ure that this <HI>I&s;land</HI> mu&s;t, on account of its greater Wealth, afford them Opportunities of making larger Acqui&s;itions than they could at home.</P>
<P>Have not almo&s;t all the Gentlemen thro' this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, <HI>declined</HI> all <HI>profitable Employments,</HI> and left them to be filled by others? Can there be a &s;tronger Argument of their Wealth, than their chu&s;ing to live at their <HI>Ea&s;e, out of Office,</HI> rather than be at the &s;mall Trouble which attends the Di&s;|charge of a beneficial Employment?</P>
<P>Could &s;o many e&s;tated Gentlemen thro' the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> afford to keep &s;o much of their <HI>Lands wa&s;te</HI> and <HI>untenanted,</HI> if they had not <HI>Money</HI> enough by them to live without Tenants; and would not the Tenants likewi&s;e be glad to take this wa&s;te Land to plow and &s;ow, but that they have ready Money enough to buy <HI>Bread Corn</HI> and other Nece&s;&s;aries from all the World be&s;ide?</P>
<P>As another &s;ignal Mark of our Riches, there is &s;carce a Gentleman who does not educate his Sons at our UNIVERSITY (<HI>which as the World &s;ees, wants not its due Encourage|ment</HI>) where they live at va&s;t Expences, take Degrees, return to their Fathers, who, with|out ever troubling <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> maintain them afterwards at <HI>Home,</HI> like <HI>Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Do not many of our Nobility through Wan|tonne&s;s and Superfluity, re&s;ide con&s;tantly in <HI>ano|ther Kingdom,</HI> where it is well known they make a better Figure, as to <HI>Hou&s;es, Coaches,</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="198">
and <HI>Equipages,</HI> than their Neighbours? And do not our young <HI>Peers,</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> who go thither <HI>to &s;ee the World, Game, Race, Drink,</HI> &amp;c. beyond any in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> of the &s;ame Age and Quality? Which they could not po&s;|&s;ibly do, if their Agents here had not an <HI>un|drainable Fund to &s;upply them.</HI> For as the <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Nemo dat quod non habet:</HI> Or as the <HI>Juglar</HI> very elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Where nothing is, there nothing can come out.</HI></P>
<P>If it be true, (I know it is confidently report|ed) that a great Number of <HI>Engli&s;h Robbers</HI> are come over; that likewi&s;e is a very &s;trong Argument of our Wealth; for they would never quit the <HI>Engli&s;h Streets</HI> and <HI>Roads</HI> for ours, unle&s;s they were &s;ure to find an Advantage by the Change. It is mo&s;t certain we never had &s;uch a Number of <HI>Robbers</HI> as at this very Juncture; from whence we may conclude, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly multiply thus, if they did not find Hou&s;es and People enough to rob, for all Profe&s;&s;ions and Trades encrea&s;e accord|ing to the Encouragement they meet with.</P>
<P>Are not whole Streets adding every Day to our <HI>Metropolis,</HI> when one would think it large enough already? Some entire Streets and many Hou&s;es, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are wa&s;te and uninha|bited. But does not this &s;hew the Wealth and Wantonne&s;s of the Inhabitants, who, not content with their pre&s;ent Dwellings, change them for others more co&s;tly and expen&s;ive?</P>
<P>Do not great Numbers of our Inhabitants, daily go off to <HI>America?</HI> will any Man &s;ay, this can be done with empty Pockets? Can any
<PB N="199" REF="199">
Man think otherwi&s;e, but that it mu&s;t be the Effect of va&s;t Superfluity, when People wan|tonly take &s;uch long Voyages, and Journeys, to go where they have no Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Argument I &s;hall offer for the Wealth of this Kingdom, is the great Number of <HI>Beggars</HI> in which it abounds; for it is a com|mon Ob&s;ervation, that Riches are the Parent of Idlene&s;s, Sloth, and Luxury; and are not the&s;e naturally productive of Want and Beg|gary?</P>
<P>I could offer many more Arguments, but that I hope you and your Countrymen are &s;ufficiently convinced, by what I have &s;aid, that <HI>Ireland</HI> is a Place of great Wealth, Afflu|ence, and Plenty. Therefore let me advi&s;e you, the next Time you put Pen to Paper, not to dre&s;s up <HI>Hibernia</HI> in Rags and Dirt, but cloath her in <HI>Scarlet</HI> and <HI>fine Linnen;</HI> for &s;he can very well afford them. Draw the <HI>God</HI> of Riches, hovering over your <HI>I&s;land,</HI> &s;haking ten Thou&s;and of Golden Feathers from his Wings, much more than the Inhabitants can gather. And thus will your Countrymen who have retrenched upon your la&s;t groundle&s;s Alarm, return to their former Ho&s;pitality, and we &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Halcyon,</HI> that is <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> Days once more.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> began by acquainting us, that (contrary to his Adverti&s;ement) he thought himfelf in duty and con&s;cience, oblig'd to change the &s;ubject Matter of his intended di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;Here he paus'd, and &s;eem'd for a &s;hort &s;pace as it were lo&s;t in Devotion and mental Prayer; after which, with great earne&s;tne&s;s and vehe|mence he &s;pake as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Friends and Fellow Citizens, all &s;peculative Science is at an end; the Period of all things is at Hand; on <HI>Friday</HI> next this World &s;hall be no more. Put not your confidence in me Brethren, for to morrow Morning five
<PB N="202" REF="202">
Minutes after five the Truth will be Evi|dent; in that in&s;tant the Comet &s;hall appear, of which I have heretofore warn'd you. As ye have heard, believe. Go hence, and prepare your Wives, your Families and Friends, for the univer&s;al Change."</Q></P>
<P>At this &s;olemn and dreadful Prediction, the whole Society appear'd in the utmo&s;t A&s;toni&s;h|ment: but it would be unju&s;t not to remember that Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> him&s;elf was in &s;o calm a Temper, as to return a Shilling a piece to the Youths who had been di&s;appointed of their Lec|ture, which I thought from a Man of his In|tegrity a convincing Proof of his own Faith in the Prediction.</P>
<P>As we thought it a Duty, in Charity to warn all Men; in two or three Hours the News had &s;pread through the City. At fir&s;t indeed, our report met with but little Credit, it being by our greate&s;t dealers in Stocks, thought only a Court-Artifice to &s;ink them, that &s;ome choice Favourites might purcha&s;e at a lower Rate; for the <HI>South Sea,</HI> that very Evening fell five <HI>per Cent.</HI> the <HI>India,</HI> eleven; and all the other Funds in Proportion. But at the Court-end of the Town, our Atte&s;tations were intirely disbe|liev'd or turn'd into ridicule; yet neverthele&s;s the News &s;pread every where, and was the &s;ub|ject matter of all Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>That very Night, (as I was credibly in|form'd) Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> was &s;ent for to a great Lady, who is very curious in the Learned Sciences, and addicted to all the Speculative Doubts of the mo&s;t able Philo&s;ophers; but he
<PB N="203" REF="203">
was not now to be found: and &s;ince at other times, he has been known not to decline that Honour, I make no doubt he conceal'd him&s;elf to attend the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Soul: But whether it was the Lady's Faith, or Inqui&s;itive|ne&s;s, that oca&s;ion'd her to &s;end, is a Point I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine. As for his being &s;ent for to the Secretary's Office by a Me&s;&s;enger, it is now known to be a Matter notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, and indeed at fir&s;t it had little credit with me, that &s;o Zealous and Ho|ne&s;t a Man &s;hould be <HI>ordered into Cu&s;tody,</HI> as a <HI>Seditious Preacher,</HI> who is known to be &s;o well affected to the <HI>pre&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas now I reflected with exceeding trouble and &s;orrow, that I had di&s;us'd Family Prayers for above five Years, and (though it hath been a Cu&s;tom of late intirely neglected by Men of any Bu&s;ine&s;s or Station) I determin'd within my&s;elf no longer to omit &s;o rea&s;onable and reli|gious a Duty. I acquainted my Wife with my Intentions: But two or three Neighbours hav|ing been engaged to Sup with us that Night, and many Hours being unwarily &s;pent at Cards, I was prevail'd upon by her, to put it off till the next Day; &s;he rea&s;oning, that it would be time enough to take off the Servants from their Bu&s;ine&s;s (which this practice mu&s;t infallibly oc|ca&s;ion for an Hour or two every Day) after the <HI>Comet</HI> had made its appearance.</P>
<P><HI>Zachary Bowen,</HI> a Quaker, and my next Neighbour, had no &s;ooner heard of the Pro|phecy but he made me a Vi&s;it. I informed
<PB N="204" REF="204">
him of every thing I had heard, but found him quite ob&s;tinate in his unbelieve; for, &s;aid he, be comforted, Friend, thy tidings are Impo&s;&s;ibili|ties, for were the&s;e things to happen, they mu&s;t have been fore&s;een by &s;ome of our Bre|thren. This indeed (as in all other &s;piritual Ca&s;es with this Sett of People) was his only rea|&s;on again&s;t believing me; and, as he was fully per&s;uaded that the Prediction was erroneous, he in a very neighbourly Manner admoni&s;hed me again&s;t <HI>&s;elling my Stock,</HI> at the pre&s;ent low Price; which, he &s;aid, beyond di&s;pute mu&s;t have a Ri&s;e before <HI>Monday,</HI> when this unrea&s;o|nable Con&s;ternation &s;hould be over.</P>
<P>But on WEDNESDAY Morning (I believe to the exact Calculation of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>) the <HI>Comet</HI> appear'd: For at three Minutes aster five by my own Watch, I &s;aw it. He indeed, foretold that it would be &s;een at five Minutes after Five, but as the be&s;t Watches may be a Minute or two too &s;low, I am apt to think his Calculation ju&s;t to a Minute.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a quarter of an Hour, all <HI>Cheap|&s;ide</HI> was crouded with a va&s;t concour&s;e of Peo|ple, and notwith&s;tanding it was &s;o early, 'tis thought that through all that part of the Town, there was not Man, Woman or Child, except the Sick, or Infirm, left in their Beds. From my own Balcony, I am con&s;ident, I &s;aw &s;everal Thou&s;ands in the Street, and counted at lea&s;t &s;eventeen who were upon their Knees, and &s;eem'd in actual Devotion. Eleven of them indeed appear'd to be old Women of about Four&s;core; The Six others, were Men in an
<PB N="205" REF="205">
advanc'd Life, but (as I could gue&s;s) two of them might be under Seventy.</P>
<P>It is highly probable, that an event of this Nature, may be pa&s;s'd over by the greater Hi&s;torians of our Times, as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep Schemes of Politicians and My&s;teries of State; for which rea&s;on, I thought it might not be unacceptable to record the Facts, which in the Space of three Days came to my Knowledge, either as an Eye-witne&s;s, or from unque&s;tionable Authorities; nor can I think this Narrative will be intirely without its U&s;e, as it may enable us to form a more ju&s;t Idea of our Countrymen in general, particularly in regard to their Faith, Religion, Morals and Politicks.</P>
<P>Before WEDNESDAY Noon, the Belief was univer&s;al that the Day of Judgment was at Hand, in&s;omuch, that a Waterman of my accquaintance told me he counted no le&s;s than one hundred and twenty three Clergymen, who had been ferry'd over to <HI>Lambeth</HI> before twelve a-Clock: the&s;e, 'tis &s;aid, went thither, to Petition, that a <HI>&s;hort Prayer</HI> might be <HI>Penn'd</HI> and <HI>Order'd,</HI> there being none in the Service upon that occa&s;ion. But as in things of this Nature, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Council</HI> be con&s;ulted, their reque&s;t was not immediately comply'd with; and this I affirm to be the true and only Rea&s;on that the Churches were not that Morning &s;o well attended; and is in no ways to be imputed to the Fears and Con|&s;ternation of the Clergy, with which the Free|thinkers
<PB N="206" REF="206">
have &s;ince very unju&s;tly reproach'd them.</P>
<P>My Wife and I went to Church (where we had not been for many Years on a Week-day) and, with a very large Congregation, were di&s;|appointed of the Service. But (what will be &s;carce credible) by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of a 'Prentice, in our ab&s;ence, we had a Piece of fine <HI>Cambric</HI> carried off by a Shop-lifter, &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion was yet made on the minds of tho&s;e wicked Women!</P>
<P>I cannot omit the care of a particular <HI>Direc|tor of the Bank;</HI> I hope the worthy and wealthy Knight will forgive me that I endeavour to do him Ju&s;tice; for it was unque&s;tionably owing to Sir <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> H</HI><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s &s;agacity that all the <HI>Fire-Offices</HI> were requir'd to have a particular Eye upon the <HI>Bank of England.</HI> Let it be recorded to his Prai&s;e that in the general hurry, this &s;truck him as his neare&s;t and tendere&s;t concern; but the next day in the Evening, after having taken due care of all his Books, Bills and Bonds, I was inform'd, his mind was wholly turn'd upon Spiritual Matters; yet, ever and anon, he could not help expre&s;&s;ing his re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> to whom he imputed that &s;udden <HI>Run upon the Bank</HI> which happen'd on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Great Man (whom at this time it may not be prudent to name) employ'd all the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, to make up &s;uch an Account as might appear fair, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be call'd upon to produce it on the <HI>Friday;</HI> but was forced to de&s;i&s;t, after having
<PB N="207" REF="207">
for &s;everal Hours together attempted it, not be|ing able to bring him&s;elf to a re&s;olution to tru&s;t the many hundred Articles of his &s;ecret Tran&s;a|ctions upon Paper.</P>
<P>Another &s;eem'd to be very melancholy, which his flatterers imputed to his dread of lo&s;ing his Power in a Day or two; but I rather take it, that his chief concern was, the Terror of be|ing try'd in a Court that could not be influenc'd and where a Majority of Voices could avail him nothing. It was ob&s;erv'd too, that he had few Vi&s;itors that Day; this added &s;o much to his Mortification, that he read thro' the fir&s;t Chap|ter of the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and wept over it bitterly; in &s;hort, he &s;eem'd a true Penitent in every thing but in Charity to his Neighbour. No bu&s;ine&s;s was that Day done in his <HI>Compting-Hou&s;e;</HI> 'tis &s;aid too, that he was advis'd to Re&s;titution, but I never heard that he comply'd with it any farther than in giving half a Crown a piece to &s;everal craz'd, and &s;tarving Creditors, who attended in the outward Room.</P>
<P>Three of the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> &s;ent to coun|termand their Birth-day Cloaths; two of them burnt all their Collections of Novels and Ro|mances, and &s;ent to a Book&s;eller's <HI>in Pall-mall</HI> to buy each of them a Bible, and <HI>Taylor</HI>'s <HI>Holy Living and Dying.</HI> But I mu&s;t do all of them the Ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that they &s;hew'd a very decent Behaviour in the drawing Room, and re&s;train'd them&s;elves from tho&s;e innocent Freedoms and little Levities &s;o commonly inci|dent to young Ladies of their Profe&s;&s;ion. So ma|ny Birth-day Suits were countermanded the next
<PB N="208" REF="208">
Day, that mo&s;t of the Taylors and Mantua|makers di&s;charg'd all their Journeymen and Women. A grave elderly Lady of great Eru|dition and Mode&s;ty who vi&s;its the&s;e young Ladies, &s;eem'd to be extreamly &s;hock'd, by the Apprehen&s;ions that She was to appear naked before the whole World; and no le&s;s &s;o, that all Mankind was to appear naked before Her; which might &s;o much divert her Thoughts, as to incapacitate her to give Ready and apt An|&s;wers to the Interrogatories that might be made her. The Maids of Honour who had both Mode&s;ty and Curio&s;ity, could not imagine the Sight &s;o di&s;agreeable as was repre&s;ented; nay, one of them went &s;o far as to &s;ay, &s;he perfectly long'd to &s;ee it; for it could not be &s;o indecent, when every body was to be alike; and they had a Day or two to prepare them|&s;elves, to be &s;een in that condition. Upon this reflection, each of them order'd a Bathing-Tub to be got ready that Evening, and a Looking-Gla&s;s to be &s;et by it. So much are the&s;e young Ladies both by Nature and Cu&s;tom addicted to cleanly appearance.</P>
<P>A We&s;t-Country Gentleman told me, he got a Church-Lea&s;e fill'd up that Morning for the &s;ame Sum which had been refus'd for three Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. I mu&s;t impute this meerly to accident; for I cannot imagine that any Divine could take the advantage of his Tenant, in &s;o unhand&s;ome a Manner; or that the &s;hort|ne&s;s of the Life was in the lea&s;t his Con&s;idera|tion; though I have heard the &s;ame worthy
<PB N="209" REF="209">
Prelate a&s;pers'd and malign'd &s;ince upon this very Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Term</HI> being &s;o near, the alarm among the LAWYERS was inexpre&s;&s;ible, though &s;ome of them, I was told, were &s;o vain as to promi&s;e them&s;elves &s;ome advantages in making their de|fence, by being vers'd in the Practice of our earthly Courts. It is &s;aid too, that &s;ome of the chief Pleaders were heard to expre&s;s great &s;atis|faction, that there had been but &s;ew <HI>State-Tryals</HI> of late Years. Several Attornies de|manded the <HI>return of Fees</HI> that had been given the Lawyers: but it was an&s;wered the Fee was undoubtedly charg'd to their Client, and that they could not connive at &s;uch Inju&s;tice, as to &s;uffer it to be &s;unk in the Attorney's Pockets. Our &s;age and learned <HI>Judges</HI> had great con&s;ola|tion, in&s;omuch as they had not pleaded at the Bar for &s;everal Years; the <HI>Barri&s;ters</HI> rejoyced in that they were not <HI>Attornies,</HI> and the Attor|nies felt no le&s;s &s;atisfaction that they were not <HI>Petti-foggers, Scriveners,</HI> and other meaner Officers of the Law.</P>
<P>As to the ARMY, far be it from me to con|ceal the Truth. Every Soldier's behaviour was as undi&s;mayed, and undaunted, as if nothing was to happen: I impute not this to their want of Faith, but to their martial Di&s;po&s;ition; though I cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more <HI>Oaths</HI> than are requi&s;ite, of which there was no re|markable diminution this Morning on the Pa|rade in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park. But po&s;&s;ibly it was by choice, and on con&s;ideration, that they
<PB N="210" REF="210">
continued this way of Expre&s;&s;ion, not to intimi|date the common Soldiers, or give occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect that even the Fear of Damnation could make any impre&s;&s;ion upon their Superior Offi|cers. A <HI>Duel</HI> was fought the &s;ame Morning between two Colonels, not occa&s;ion'd, (as was reported) becau&s;e the one was put over the other's Head; that being a Point which might at &s;uch a Juncture have been accommodated by the Mediation of Friends; but as this was upon the account of a Lady, 'twas judg'd it could not be put off at this time, above all others, but demanded immediate Satisfaction. I am apt to believe that a young Officer who de&s;ir'd his Surgeon to defer putting him into a Salivation till <HI>Saturday,</HI> might make this reque&s;t out of &s;ome Opinion he had of the truth of the Pro|phecy; for the apprehen&s;ions of any danger in the Operation could not be his Motive, the Surgeon him&s;elf having a&s;&s;ured me that he had before undergone three &s;evere Operations of the like Nature, with great re&s;ignation and for|titude.</P>
<P>There was an Order i&s;&s;ued, that the <HI>Chap|lains</HI> of the &s;everal <HI>Regiments</HI> &s;hould attend their Duty; but as they were di&s;pers'd about in &s;everal parts of <HI>England,</HI> it was believ'd, that mo&s;t of them could not be found, or &s;o much as heard of, till the great Day was over.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable PHYSICIANS by their outward demeanor &s;eem'd to be Unbelie|vers; but at the &s;ame time, they every where in&s;inuated, that there might be a <HI>Pe&s;tilential Malignancy</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Co|met,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="211">
which might be arm'd again&s;t by proper and timely Medicines. This caution had but little effect; for as the time approach'd, the Chri&s;tian Re&s;ignation of the People encreas'd, and mo&s;t of them (which was never before known) had their Souls more at Heart, than their Bodies.</P>
<P>If the Reverend CLERGY &s;how'd more Concern than others, I charitably impute it to their great <HI>charge of Souls;</HI> and what confirm'd me in this Opinion was, that the <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Apprehen&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Terror</HI> could be di&s;tingui&s;h'd to be greater or le&s;s, according to their <HI>Ranks</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> in the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>The like might be ob&s;erv'd in all &s;orts of Mini&s;ters, though not of the Church of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> the higher their Rank, the more was their Fear.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of the COURT, for fear of of|fence; and I forbear In&s;erting the <HI>Names</HI> of particular Per&s;ons, to avoid the imputation of Slander, &s;o that the Reader will allow this Narrative mu&s;t be deficient, and is therefore de&s;ir'd to accept hereof rather as a Sketch, than a regular circum&s;tantial Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I was not inform'd of any Per&s;ons who &s;hew'd the lea&s;t Joy, except three Malefactors who were to be executed the <HI>Monday</HI> following, and one Old Man, a con&s;tant Church-goer, who being at the point of Death, expre&s;t &s;ome &s;atis|faction at the News.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning there was little or nothing tran&s;acted in <HI>Change-Alley;</HI> there were a Multitude of Sellers, but &s;o few Buyers,
<PB N="212" REF="212">
that one cannot affirm the Stocks bore any cer|tain Price except among the <HI>Jews;</HI> who this Day, reap'd great Profit by their Infidelity. There were many who call'd them&s;elves <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> who offer'd to buy <HI>for time,</HI> but as the&s;e were People of <HI>great Di&s;tinction,</HI> I chu&s;e not to mention them, becau&s;e in effect it would &s;eem to accu&s;e them both of Avarice, and In|fidelity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Run</HI> upon the <HI>Bank</HI> is too well known to need a particular Relation; for it never can be forgotten that no one Per&s;on whatever (ex|cept the <HI>Directors</HI> them&s;elves, and &s;ome of their particular Friends and A&s;&s;ociates) could convert a <HI>Bill</HI> all that Day into <HI>Specie;</HI> all hands being imploy'd to &s;erve <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;everal Churches of the City and Suburbs, there were &s;even Thou&s;and two Hun|dred and Forty Five, who publickly and &s;o|lemnly declar'd before the Congregation, that they took to Wife their &s;everal <HI>kept Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> which was allow'd as valid Marriage, the Prie&s;ts not having time to pronounce the Ceremony in Form.</P>
<P>At St. <HI>Bride</HI>'s Church in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wool&s;ton</HI> (who writ again&s;t the Miracles of our Saviour) in the utmo&s;t Terrors of Con&s;cience, made a publick Recantation. Dr. <HI>Mandevil;</HI> (who had been groundle&s;sly reported formerly to have done the &s;ame) did it now in good earne&s;t at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Gate; as did al&s;o at the <HI>Tem|ple</HI> Church &s;everal Gentlemen, who frequent <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;es</HI> near the Bar. So great was the Faith and Fear of two of them, that they
<PB N="213" REF="213">
dropt Dead on the Spot; but I will not record their Names, le&s;t I &s;hould be thought invidi|ou&s;ly to lay an Odium on their Families and Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Players</HI> who had very little Faith before, were now de&s;irous of having as much as they cou'd, and therefore embrac'd the <HI>Roman Catholick Religion;</HI> the &s;ame thing was ob&s;erv'd of &s;ome <HI>Bawds,</HI> and <HI>Ladies of Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman out of pure Friend&s;hip came to make me a Vi&s;it, and advis'd me to <HI>hire a Boat</HI> for the en&s;uing Day, and told me, that unle&s;s I gave earne&s;t for one immediately, he fear'd it might be too late; for his Country|men had &s;ecured almo&s;t every Boat upon the River, as judging that, in the <HI>general Conflagra|tion</HI> to be upon the <HI>Water</HI> would be the <HI>&s;afe&s;t Place.</HI></P>
<P>There were <HI>two Lords,</HI> and <HI>three Commoners,</HI> who, out of a &s;cruple of Con&s;cience, very ha|&s;tily threw up their Pen&s;ions, as imagining a Pen|&s;ion was only an annual <HI>retaining Bribe.</HI> All the other great Pen&s;ioners, I was told, had their Scruples quieted by a <HI>Clergyman</HI> or two of di&s;tin|ction, whom they happily con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>It was remarkable that &s;everal of our very riche&s;t <HI>Trade&s;men</HI> of the City, in common Cha|rity, gave away Shillings and Six-pences to the Beggars, who ply'd about the Church Doors; and at a particular Church in the City, a Weal|thy <HI>Church-warden</HI> with his own Hands di&s;tri|buted Fifty twelve-penny Loaves to the Poor by way of Re&s;titution for the many great and
<PB N="214" REF="214">
co&s;tly Fea&s;ts, which he had eaten of at their ex|pence.</P>
<P>Three great Ladies, a <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> two Lords, a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer, five Half|pay Captains, and a Baronet, (all noted <HI>Game|&s;ters</HI>) came publickly into a Church at <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> and depo&s;ited a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money in the Mini&s;ter's Hands; the Parties whom they had defrauded, being either out of Town, or not to be found. But &s;o great is the Hardne&s;s of Heart of this Fraternity, that a|mong either the Noble, or Vulgar Game&s;ters, (though the Profe&s;&s;ion is &s;o general) I did not hear of any other re&s;titution of this Sort. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that (in compari|&s;on of the&s;e) through all parts of the Town, the Ju&s;tice and Penitence of the <HI>Highway-Men, Hou&s;e-breakers,</HI> and common <HI>Pick-Pockets</HI> was very remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Directors</HI> of our <HI>Publick Companies</HI> were in &s;uch dreadful apprehen&s;ions, that one would have thought a <HI>Parliamentary Enquiry</HI> was at hand; yet &s;o great was their pre&s;ence of Mind, that all the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning was taken up in <HI>private Transfers,</HI> which by malicious People was thought to be done with de&s;ign to conceal their Effects.</P>
<P>I forbear mentioning the private Confe&s;&s;ions of particular <HI>Ladies</HI> to their <HI>Husbands;</HI> for as their Children were born in Wedlock, and of con&s;e|quence are Legitimate, it would be an invidious Task to record them as Ba&s;tards; and particu|larly after their &s;everal Husbands have &s;o chari|tably forgiven them.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="215">
The Evening and Night, through the whole Town, were &s;pent in Devotions both Publick and Private; the Churches for this one Day, were &s;o crowded by the Nobility and Gentry, that Thou&s;ands of common People were &s;een praying in the publick Streets. In &s;hort, one would have thought the whole Town had been really and &s;eriou&s;ly religious. But what was very remarkable, all the different Per&s;ua&s;ions kept by them&s;elves, for as each thought the other would be damned, not one would join in Prayer with the other.</P>
<P>At length FRIDAY came, and the People cover'd all the Streets; Expecting, Watching and Praying. But as the Day wore away, their Fears fir&s;t began to abate, then le&s;&s;en'd every hour, at Night they were almo&s;t extinct, till the total Darkne&s;s, that hitherto us'd to terrify, now comforted every <HI>Free-thinker</HI> and <HI>Athei&s;t.</HI> Great numbers went together to the <HI>Taverns,</HI> be&s;poke <HI>Suppers,</HI> and broke up whole <HI>Hogs|heads</HI> for joy. The &s;ubject of all Wit and Conver&s;ation was to ridicule the Prophecy, and railly each other. All the Quality and Gentry were <HI>perfectly a&s;ham'd,</HI> nay, &s;ome utterly di&s;|own'd that they had manife&s;ted any Signs of Religion.</P>
<P>But the next Day, even the Common People, as well as their Betters, appear'd in their u&s;ual &s;tate of Indifference. They Drank, they Whor'd, they Swore, they Ly'd, they Cheated, they Plunder'd, they Gam'd, they Quarrell'd, they Murder'd. In &s;hort, the World went on in the old Channel.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="216">
I need not give any In&s;tances of what will &s;o ea&s;ily be credited, but I cannot omit relating, that Mr. <HI>Wool&s;ton</HI> advertis'd, in that very <HI>Satur|day</HI>'s <HI>Evening-Po&s;t,</HI> a new <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Miracles</HI> of our Saviour; and that the few, who had given up their Pen&s;ions the Day before, &s;o|licited to have them continued; which, as they had not been thrown up upon any Mini&s;terial Point, I am inform'd was readily granted.</P>

<L>Yes; you call'd my Ma&s;ter a Knave: Fie Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> 'tis a Shame</L>
<L>For a Par&s;on, who &s;hou'd know better Things, to come out with &s;uch a Name.</L>
<L>Knave in your Teeth, Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> 'tis both a Shame and a Sin,</L>
<L>And the Dean my Ma&s;ter is an hone&s;ter Man than you and all your kin:</L>
<L>He has more goodne&s;s in his little Finger, than you have in your whole Body,</L>
