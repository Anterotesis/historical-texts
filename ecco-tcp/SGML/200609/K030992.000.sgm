<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX</HI>
TO THE
HISTORY
OF THE
Crown-Inn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, that had I not,
thro' the great Hopes and Ex|pectation
of &s;eeing you e're
this, omitted &s;omething in my
la&s;t which I thought proper
to communicate to you, and
would have done it Per&s;onally if our good
Stars had &s;o directed, I &s;hould have had no
farther Occa&s;ion of adding to all my former,
being of them&s;elves &s;ufficiently long and
tire&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
As in the greate&s;t Variety we are always
put to the harde&s;t difficulty in fixing our
Choice; &s;o in the va&s;t Field, the numerous
Subjects for Di&s;cour&s;e, one is at greater lo&s;s
to put one's Thoughts into any Method: for
in all In&s;tances, we find, there is no &s;urer
Evidence of a good <HI>Genius</HI> than that which
is &s;hewn in the Effect of Choice.</P>
<P>I have very great rea&s;on to believe, that
every thing is well receiv'd by you; not
thro' any Motive, but your &s;incere Friend|&s;hip,
nor any Merit but the Subject; both
I know are particular, but one much more
worthy your Attention.</P>
<P>One wou'd believe by their Actions, that a
Set of People here are really infected in their
Brains, and that they lie under the &s;ame In|fluence
with Creatures of another Species
which have lately been vi&s;ited with a very
odd Di&s;temper: There is &s;ome kind of cor|re&s;pondency
in their Maladies; only that
which affects the Two-legg'd Creatures
&s;eems to be of the mo&s;t fearful and
tremendous Con&s;equence, and to threa|ten
the Country in the mo&s;t dear and
tender Part: But thank God the Di&s;tem|per
is not Epidemical; tho' it &s;eems the
Nature of tho&s;e infected, to endeavour all
they can to &s;pread it about, and to make
<PB N="5" REF="4">
others in the &s;ame pickle with them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Symptoms they are &s;eiz'd with, are a
kind of Splenatick Mad Fits, not much un|like
Madne&s;s; they foam at the Mouth,
roll their Eyes, and utter &s;trange incoherent
Speeches, and in this manner go raving up
and down the Town. The direct Cure for
this we know were a Dark Room, and
Clean Straw, with &s;ome Manual Exerci&s;e,
&s;lender Diet, and other proper Methods to
correct the Fumes of the Di&s;temper: But at
the rate they go on, I de&s;pair of any Cure
for them; and were it not for the Honour of
living in a Free Country, where LIBERTY
has been always the Peoples Right, they are
&s;uch as ought rather to be &s;hut up in <HI>Pe&s;t|hou&s;es</HI>
to prevent a Contagion, than to
breath in the open Air among Men of free
and generous Principles.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Creatures appear in <HI>Furr'd
Gowns, Tufted Garments,</HI> and fit in the <HI>High
Places,</HI> but are indeed Men of the mo&s;t &s;hal|low
and humble Under&s;tandings; and you
will find very few among them that act with
a Spirit of Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, or are not at|tached
to the Per&s;on of young <HI>Shute.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;carce Patience to Preface any lon|ger,
when I think what degenerate Fellows
<PB N="6" REF="5">
I treat on. Good G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d, what is become of
that ancient Spirit that u&s;ed to reign in this
Kingdom! or for which of our Sins was this
&s;tubborn Generation &s;own among us, which
have &s;prung up like the <HI>Tares</HI> that almo&s;t
choaked the <HI>good Corn!</HI></P>
<P>Wou'd they produce an In&s;tance of that
Time when they have not been Tumultuous
and Trouble&s;ome, I would &s;pare their Shame;
unle&s;s it were like the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">l, <HI>who is good
when he is plea&s;ed.</HI> They had &s;et their Hearts
&s;o upon Rule, in the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Reign, when
they carry'd their Point as far, and &s;at with as
much Security, as the memory of any known
Time ever afforded them, (the Days of
<HI>Sir JACOB</HI> excepted) that 'tis no very
great wonder they are &s;o Impatient under
their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. They had
really under Her procured a pretty Te|nantable
Lea&s;e, few <HI>COPY-HOLDS</HI> were
firmer; and they were endeavouring to get
a Grant of the <HI>Inheritance</HI> in <HI>Fee-&s;imple</HI>;
when, alas, the <HI>Lea&s;e</HI> it &s;elf depending on
one &s;ingle Life ca&s;ually expired.</P>
<P>Considering the Mi&s;chief they might do,
by the Influence of their former Power, and
how likely the De&s;peratene&s;s of their Ca&s;e
was to put them upon it; what a Happine&s;s
mu&s;t we acknowledge their Stupidity to be,
in fancying they had Preten&s;ions to Renew it
<PB N="7" REF="6">
under Mr. WRIGHT? And how ju&s;tly may
we impute our Safety to their mi&s;erably de|ceived
Expectations; and regret the le&s;s,
that it is the deplorable Occa&s;ion of their
pre&s;ent Inveteracy, Rage, and Fury.</P>
<P>I told you the State they &s;tood in at prefer|ring
the <HI>Old Servants</HI> again, and the grievous
Clamours they rai&s;ed again&s;t it; tho' their
ju&s;tifying the &s;ame thing in the <HI>Widow,</HI> had
made it a very remarkable Precedent; which,
of all Men, they ought to be the la&s;t to Cen|&s;ure:
But Nature is predominant. 'Tis true,
one Inconveniency &s;eems to ari&s;e from their
being di&s;placed, which is, that they are too
much at leizure to Plot and Cabal with the
<HI>Friends</HI> of young <HI>Shute,</HI> who by that En|couragement
and Addition to their <HI>Party,</HI>
begin to gather Life again, and to rouze
them&s;elves from a De&s;pair that the late Al|teration
had thrown them into. Their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
is now to act in concert together, and
not unlikely as Propperties to each other;
the <HI>Family of the Bulls,</HI> by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
to introduce them&s;elves into Power again;
and the other, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, to advance
the Intere&s;t of young <HI>Sir Jacob.</HI> One
thing in this is certain, that they have uni|ted
their Forces again; and the daily Cla|mours
and Di&s;turbances we hear of in the
Country, are the true Effects of it. 'Tis
&s;trange, that the <HI>BULLS FAMILY,</HI> who
<PB N="8" REF="7">
have always been the Tools to <HI>Sir JACOB</HI>
and his <HI>I&s;&s;ue,</HI> &s;hould not once endeavour to
honour them&s;elves, by di&s;claiming &s;o &s;can|dalous
a Corre&s;pondence. But Reproofs are
vain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow,</HI> poor Woman, began &s;everely
to feel the Effect of Patronizing them &s;o
long; and 'tis pity a Life of &s;uch Con&s;e|quence
&s;hould be &s;ullied with their <HI>MIS|CARRIAGES.</HI>
I can hardly mention with|out
Tears, the Advantage it may give Po&s;te|rity
of treating her Memory with Contempt,
and ob&s;curing a Hi&s;tory that would el&s;e
have appeared as bright as the Element her
own Vertues &s;hone in, and could have been
liable to no Contradiction from the mo&s;t
partial <HI>Pen.</HI></P>
<P>But we will forgive them this; forgive
the &s;ad Occa&s;ion of her Death: But &s;hall we
forgive their going on in the &s;ame Road, their
repetition of Practices that have always been
pernicious to the Intere&s;t of their Country.
'Tis well known, they were her Aver&s;ion;
the lea&s;t of her Care or Concern for Nine
Years; which they &s;ufficiently revenged,
by teazing her out of her Life in le&s;s
than half the time; and heaping on her
anxious Head as great a weight of
Trouble and Perplexity, as their Pre|dece&s;&s;ors
the <HI>OLD SERVANTS</HI> had
<PB N="9" REF="8">
loaded with accumulated Glory and Ad|vantages.</P>
<P>But I will have done with this Repetition;
you know the Truth of it too well already:
Do but revolve the Pa&s;&s;ages and Incidents
of their la&s;t &s;hort Reign, (for you mu&s;t un|der&s;tand
they have been in Power in other
pa&s;t Times to as good a Purpo&s;e) and you
will find, that not one &s;ingle Action or Con|&s;equence
went well from the very footing of
their Admini&s;tration: Unle&s;s you will be|lieve
that idle Story trumpt up by them at
that time, of their beginning with Saving
the <HI>Church</HI>; which in reality never flouri&s;hed
with greater Tranquillity than during the
<HI>Widow</HI>'s time: And I believe they will them|&s;elves
acknowledge, when they have not
a mind to be merry with us, that it was the
highe&s;t In&s;olence and Affront to impute the
contrary to Her.</P>
<P>Now I am &s;peaking of this, I cannot but
acquaint you with an odd Accident that
happen'd here t'other Day: An innocent
Country Vicar Preaching in Town, was
In&s;alted and very rudely Treated by the
Pari&s;hioners of the BULLIAN PARTY.
The Offence he was guilty of, was, <HI>ble&s;&s;ing
Heaven for the happy Situation of Affairs, and
the imminent Danger we were lately re&s;cued
from.</HI> But that is not the Occa&s;ion I men|tion
<PB N="10" REF="9">
it on. I cannot but &s;mile to think,
that the fir&s;t In&s;ult or Indignity literally
offered to the <HI>Church</HI> &s;ince the time of
<HI>Sir JACOB,</HI> &s;hould be by the <HI>Family of the
Bulls</HI> them&s;elves, who have always expre&s;&s;ed
&s;uch Reverence and Veneration to the Place
and ju&s;tified the Dignity of its Prie&s;ts even
to Rage and Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Had the other Party done as much, good
Heaven, what Clamours wou'd have been
rai&s;ed! It could not have e&s;caped the Cen&s;ure
and Con&s;truction of their going to pull the
<HI>Church</HI> down, if no wor&s;e. I hope they
will not forget it, together with their pulling
down of <HI>Conventicles,</HI> if there &s;hould be Oc|ca&s;ion
for the future to mention it to them
by way of Alternative.</P>
<P>Poor Men, they have really been unfor|tunate,
for the mo&s;t part, in rai&s;ing up Pre|cedents
again&s;t them&s;elves; tho' they are the
lea&s;t inclinable to be judged by their own
Laws of any Men breathing. Had they
fore&s;een the Con&s;equence of ju&s;tifying the
<HI>Wid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI>'s Proceeding in Di&s;placing her <HI>Old Ser|vants,</HI>
and that the Splutter they made about
her Right to do it, which they termed the
highe&s;t In&s;olence in any one to que&s;tion,
wou'd &s;o &s;oon have reverted upon them|&s;elves,
they wou'd not probably have been
&s;o violent in maintaining the Legality and
