<HEAD>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS GRAY, the &s;ubject of this narrative, was the fifth &s;on of Mr. Philip Gray, who&s;e father was a con|&s;iderable merchant, and who him&s;elf was engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A money-&s;crlvener.</NOTE>, though not to the pecuniary advantage of his family, for being of a &s;hy and indolent temper he &s;uffered tho&s;e opportunities of improving his fortune to e&s;cape him which others would have eagerly em|braced. His &s;on Thomas was born Dec. 26th 1716, in Cornhill London, and &s;ent early to Eton &s;chool under the tuition of Mr. Antrobus his maternal uncle. This gentleman, being both a good &s;cholar and a man of ta&s;te, was a&s;&s;iduous in directing the attention of his nephew to tho&s;e &s;ources of improvement which he afterwards applied to with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. During the time of Mr. Gray's continuance in this abode of the Mu&s;es he contracted the &s;tricte&s;t intimacy with two of their votaries, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions in many re|&s;pects were congenial with his own. One of the&s;e was the Honourable Horace Walpole, who hath been &s;o long con&s;picuous for his &s;kill in the fine arts and his love of letters; the other Richard We&s;t E&s;q. &s;on to a late lord chancellor of Ireland, and grand&s;on by his mother to the celebrated Bi&s;hop Burnet. As the ac|cident of his uncle's being an a&s;&s;i&s;tant at Eton was the
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
cau&s;e of his going thither for his cla&s;&s;ical learning, &s;o to this gentleman's being Fellow of Peterhou&s;e in Cambridge it was owing that he was &s;ent to the &s;ame univer&s;ity, and admitted in the year 1734 a Pen&s;ioner of the &s;ame college.</P>
<P>The reli&s;h Mr. Gray had contracted for polite li|terature before his removal to Cambridge rendered the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;tudies which then almo&s;t wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed, and at pre&s;ent too much occupy, the attention of young men altogether ta&s;tele&s;s and irkfome: &s;till
<Q>"Song was his favourite and fir&s;t pur&s;uit;"</Q>
and tho' his thoughts were directed towards the law as a profe&s;&s;ion for life, yet like Garrick in the picture between Tragedy and Comedy, he hung back with fond reluctance on the Mu&s;e. Nor was this bias of his inclination a little influenced by the con&s;tant exhor|tations of his two friends, particularly Mr. We&s;t, who was now removed to Chri&s;t's Church Oxford, and who&s;e propen&s;ity to poetry and di&s;like to the law ap|pear to have even exceeded his own. After having pa&s;&s;ed four years in college Mr. Gray returned to his father in Town, where he remained till the following &s;pring, at which time Mr. Walpole being about to travel invited his friend to go along with him. The invita|tion was accepted, and they accordingly &s;et out for Italy together, but &s;ome di&s;agreement ari&s;ing between them (occa&s;ioned, as Mr. Walpole ingenuou&s;ly con|fe&s;&s;es, le&s;s by his companion's conduct than his own)
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
they parted at Rheggio, from whence, after having made a &s;hort &s;tay at Venice, Mr. Gray returned. The time however devoted to this excur&s;ion was by no means lo&s;t: nothing that our poet &s;aw was &s;uffered to e&s;cape him. From no relation, though purpo&s;ely de&s;igned for the publick eye, can &s;o much informa|tion be drawn as from his ca&s;ual letters. During this interval of his friend's ab&s;ence Mr. We&s;t, finding that his aver&s;ion to the profe&s;&s;ion for which he had de&s;ti|ned him&s;elf (and with a view to which he had re&s;ided &s;ome time in the Temple) became almo&s;t in&s;uperable, wrote to Mr. Gray on the &s;ubject, expre&s;&s;ing in the &s;tronge&s;t manner the <HI>ennui</HI> that almo&s;t overwhelmed him. To this letter an an&s;wer was returned which pre&s;ents the fine&s;t picture of the writer's mind, and abounds with a ju&s;tne&s;s of thinking far beyond his years. Gray was now at Florence, where he had &s;pent in all eleven months, amu&s;ing him&s;elf at intervals with poetical compo&s;itions. It was here that he con|ceived the de&s;ign, and produced the fir&s;t book, of a di|dactick poem in Latin entitled <HI>De Principiis Cogitandi,</HI> and addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. We&s;t, a work which he unfor|tunately never completed. From Florence proceed|ing to Venice he returned to England, deviating but little from the route he had gone, but particularly ta|king once more in his way the Grand Chartreu&s;e, where in this vi&s;it he wrote on the album of that mo|na&s;tery the following Alcaick ode:<Q><PB N="viii" REF="8"><LG>

<P>On the 1&s;t of September 1741 he arrived in Lon|don; where he had not been much more than two months before his father was carried off by the gout, a malady from which he had long and &s;everely &s;uffered. As the inactivity and ill health of the elder Mr. Gray had prevented him from accumulating the fortune he might have acquired with ea&s;e, &s;o his imprudence had induced him to &s;quander no incon&s;iderable part of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The &s;on therefore finding his pa|trimony inadequate to the profe&s;&s;ion he had intended to follow without dimini&s;hing the income of his mother
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
and his aunt, re&s;olved for this rea&s;on to relinqui&s;h it; yet to &s;ilence their importunities on the &s;ubject he propo&s;ed only to change the line of it, and accord|ingly went to Cambridge in the year 1742 to take his Bachelor's degree. But the inconveniencies incident to a &s;canty fortune were not the only evils he had now to combat. Poor We&s;t, the friend of his heart, was overborne by a con&s;umption and family di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and the&s;e, alas! were burthens which friend&s;hip could not remove. After langui&s;hing a con&s;iderable time under their united oppre&s;&s;ion this amiable youth fell a victim to both on the 1&s;t of June 1742 at Pope's, and was interred in the chancel of Hatfield church, beneath a &s;tone bearing the epitaph below<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Here lieth the body of Richard We&s;t E&s;q. only &s;on to the Right Hon.

and nothing can more pathetically

di&s;play the feelings of a heart wounded by &s;uch a lo&s;s than that apo&s;trophe and the &s;onnet in which he gave them vent:</P>

<L>And redd'ning Phoebus lifts his golden fire,</L>
<L>The birds in vain their am'rous de&s;cant join,</L>

<L>The&s;e ears, alas! for other notes repine,</L>
<L>A diff'rent object do the&s;e eyes require;</L>
<L>My lonely angui&s;h melts no heart but mine,</L>
<L>And in my brea&s;t th' imperfect joys expire:</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="11">
Yet morning &s;miles the bu&s;y race to cheer,</L>
<L>And newborn plea&s;ure brings to happier men,</L>
<L>The fields to all their wonted tribute bear,</L>
<L>To warm their little loves the birds complain;</L>
<L>I fruitle&s;s mourn to him that cannot hear,</L>
<L>And weep the more becau&s;e I weep in vain.</L></Q>
<P>The Ode to Spring was written early in June at Stoke, whither he had gone to vi&s;it his mother, and &s;ent to Mr. We&s;t before Mr. Gray had heard of his death: how he employed his pen when this ode was returned to him with the melancholy news we have already &s;een. Impre&s;&s;ions of grief on the generality of mankind, like characters marked on the &s;and of the &s;ea, are &s;peedily effaced by the influx of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, but the traces of them on the heart of Gray were too deeply in&s;cribed to be &s;oon obliterated; we &s;hall not therefore wonder at the &s;ubjects he has cho|&s;en, nor at the &s;olemnity with which he hath treated them. His Ode on the Pro&s;pect of Eton College, as well as the Hymn to Adver&s;ity, were both written in the following Augu&s;t, and it is highly probable that the Elegy in the Country Church yard was begun al&s;o about this time.</P>
<P>Having made a vi&s;it of &s;ome length at Stoke to his mother and aunt our poet returned to Cambridge, which from this period became his principal home. The conveniencies re&s;ulting from that &s;ituation, to a per&s;on of circum&s;cribed fortune and a &s;tudious temper, were in his e&s;timation more than a counterbalance for the di&s;like which, on &s;everal accounts, he bore to
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
the place. Le&s;s plea&s;ed with exerting his own powers than in contemplating the exertions of others, he al|mo&s;t wholly devoted him&s;elf to the be&s;t writers of Greece; and &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly did he apply to the &s;tudy of their works as in the cour&s;e of &s;ix years to have read with critical exactne&s;s almo&s;t every author of note in that language. During this interval however he was not &s;o entirely occupied with his &s;tated em|ployment as to have no time for expre&s;&s;ing his aver|&s;ion to the ignorance and dulne&s;s which appeared to &s;urround him; but of what he intended on this &s;ub|ject a &s;hort fragment only remains.</P>
<P>In the year 1744 he appears to have given up en|tirely his didactick poem, and to have relinqui&s;hed, for &s;ometime at lea&s;t, any further &s;olicitations of the Mu&s;e. Mr. Walpole, notwith&s;tanding, being de&s;i|rous to pre&s;erve what he had already written, and to perpetuate the merit of their decea&s;ed friend, impor|tuned Mr. Gray to publi&s;h his own poems together with tho&s;e of Mr. We&s;t; but this Mr. Gray declined, from the apprehen&s;ion that the joint &s;tock of both would hardly fill a &s;mall volume&punc; A favourite cat be|longing to Mr. Walpole happening about this time (1747) to be drowned, Mr. Gray amu&s;ed him&s;elf with writing on the occa&s;ion an elegant little ode, in which he hath happily united both humour and in|&s;truction. But the following year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a far more important effort of his Mu&s;e; the Fragment on Education and Government, which is
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
&s;uperiour to every thing in the &s;ame &s;tyle of writing that our own language can boa&s;t of, and perhaps any other.</P>

How much it is to be wi&s;hed that Gray, in&s;tead of compiling chronological tables, had completed what he thus admirably begun! In the year 1750 he put his la&s;t hand to the Elegy in the Country Church|yard, which when fini&s;hed was communicated fir&s;t to Mr. Walpole, and by him to &s;everal per&s;ons of di|&s;tinction. I his brought Mr. Gray acquainted with Lady Cobham, and furni&s;hed an occa&s;ion for his Long Story, a compo&s;ition in which the different colours of wit and humour are peculiarly and not le&s;s intimate|ly blended than the &s;hifting hues on the faces of a diamond. The elegy having been for &s;ome time pri|vately tran&s;mitted from onehand to another, at length found its way into publick through The Magazine of Magazines. This di&s;graceful mode of appearance &s;ubjected the Author to the nece&s;&s;ity of exhibiting it under a le&s;s di&s;advantageous form; and Mr. Bentley &s;oon after wi&s;hing to &s;upply every ornament that his pencil could contribute, drew, not only for it but al&s;o for the re&s;t of Mr. Gray's productions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The headpiece to the Long Story, exhibiting a view of Stoke-Pogeis church and man&s;ion, was copied from a &s;ketch by Mr. Gray. The Churchyard was the &s;ubject of his elegy.</NOTE>, a &s;et of de|&s;igns, which were hand&s;omely repaid by &s;ome very beautiful &s;tanzas, of which unfortunately no perfect copy remains. In the March of 1753 Mr. Gray &s;u|&s;tained a lo&s;s which he long &s;everely felt: his mo|ther, to whom his conduct was exemplary for the di&s;charge of every filial duty, and who merited all
<PB N="xvii" REF="17">
the tenderne&s;s and attention &s;he received, was taken from him by death. The lines in which Mr. Pope hath expre&s;&s;ed his piety, beautiful as they are, and much as they de&s;erve to be prai&s;ed, appear notwith|&s;tanding to excite le&s;s of &s;ympathy than a &s;ingle &s;troke in the epitaph on Mrs. Gray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Here &s;leep the remains of <LB><HI>Dorothy Gray,</HI> <LB>widow, the careful tender mother <LB>of many children, one of whom alone <LB>had the misfortune to &s;urvive her.</P></Q></NOTE>, or a pa&s;&s;age in a let|ter to Mr. Ma&s;on, written the following Decem|ber, on the deaths of his father and friend: <Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een the &s;cene you de&s;cribe, and know how dread|ful it is; I know too I am the better for it. We are all idle and thoughtle&s;s things, and have no &s;en&s;e, no u&s;e in the world, any longer than that &s;ad im|pre&s;&s;ion la&s;ts: <HI>the deeper it is engraved the better.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Gray, as is evident by a letter to Dr. Wharton, had fini&s;hed his Ode on the Progre&s;s of Poetry early in 1755; his Bard al&s;o was begun about this time, and in the year following the beautiful fragment on the Plea&s;ures of Vici&s;&s;itude. From the loo&s;e hints in his commonplace-book he appears to have planned a fourth ode on the connexion between genius and grandeur, but it cannot now be a&s;certained if any part of it was actually written. A vacancy in the of|fice of Poet-Laureate was occa&s;ioned in 1757 by the death of Colley Cibber. The Duke of Devon&s;hire,
<PB N="xviii" REF="18">
being at that time Chamberlain, made a polite offer of it to Mr. Gray through the hands of Lord John Cavendi&s;h his brother; but the di&s;grace brought upon that office by the profligacy and inability of &s;ome who had filled it probably induced Mr. Gray to decline the appointment. This part of our poet's life was chiefly devoted to literary pur&s;uits and the cultiva|tion of friend&s;hip. It is obvious from the te&s;timony of his letters that he was indefatigable in the former, and that he was always ready to perform kind offices in the latter. Sir William Williams, an accompli&s;hed and gallant young officer, having been killed at Belli&s;le, his friend Mr. Fred. Montagu propo&s;ed to erect a mo|nument over him, and with this view reque&s;ted Mr. Gray to furni&s;h the epitaph. His &s;light acquaintance with Sir William would have been a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for declining the ta&s;k, but the friendline&s;s of Mr. Montagu's di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;incerity of affliction with which he was affected, wrought &s;o powerfully upon Mr. Gray that he could not refu&s;e him, though he was by no means able to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with the ver&s;es he wrote. The profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of modern lan|guages and hi&s;tory in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge becoming vacant in 1762 through the death of Mr. Turner, Mr. Gray was &s;pirited up by &s;ome of his friends to a&s;k of Lord Bute the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. His ap|plication however failed, the office having been pro|mi&s;ed to Lady Lowther for the tutor of Sir James, from a motive which reflected more honour on her
<PB N="xix" REF="19">
Lady&s;hip than on the gentleman who &s;ucceeded. In 1765 Mr. Gray, ever attached to the beauties of Na|ture as well as to the love of antiquities, undertook a journey to Scotland for the purpo&s;e of gratifying his curio&s;ity and ta&s;te. During his &s;tay in this country Dr. Beattie (though not the fir&s;t of philo&s;ophers yet a poet inferiour to none &s;ince the death of his friend, and whom he in many re&s;pects re&s;embled) found the means of engaging his notice and friend&s;hip. Through the intervention of this gentleman the Ma|ri&s;ehal College of Aberdeen had reque&s;ted to know if the degree of Doctor of Laws would be acceptable to Gray; but this mark of their attention he civilly de|clined. In December 1767 Dr. Beattie, &s;till de&s;irous that his country &s;hould afford &s;ome te&s;timony of its regard to the merit of our poet, &s;olicited his permi&s;|&s;ion to print at the Univer&s;ity pre&s;s of Gla&s;gow an elegant edition of his Works. Dod&s;ley had before a&s;ked the like favour, and Mr. Gray, unwilling to re|fu&s;e, gratified both with a copy containing a few notes and the imitations of the old Norwegian poe|try, intended to &s;upplant the Long Story, which was printed at fir&s;t only to illu&s;trate Mr. Bentley's de&s;igns. The death of Mr. Brocket in the July fol|lowing left another opening to the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip which he had before un&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;ought. Lord Bute however was not in office, and the Duke of Grafton, to preclude a reque&s;t, within two days of the vacancy appointed Mr. Gray. Cambridge before
<PB N="xx" REF="20">
had been his re&s;idence from choice, it now became &s;o from obligation, and the greater part of his time there was filled up by his old engagements or diverted to new ones. It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that he once embra|ced the project of republi&s;hing Strabo, and there are rea&s;ons to believe that he meant it, as the many geo|graphical di&s;qui&s;itions he left behind him appear to have been too minute for the gratification of general inquiry. The like ob&s;ervation may be transferred to Plato and the Greek Anthologia, as he had taken un|common pains with both, and has left a m&s;. of the latter fit for the pre&s;s. His de&s;ign of favouring the publick with the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h poetry may be &s;poken of with more certainty, as in this he had not only engaged with Mr. Ma&s;on as a colleague, but actually paraphra&s;ed the Nor&s;e and Wel&s;h poems in&s;erted in his Works for &s;pecimens of the wild &s;pirit which animated the bards of ancient days. The exten|&s;ive compa&s;s however of the &s;ubject, and the knowledge that it was al&s;o in the hands of Mr. Warton, induced him to relinqui&s;h what he had thus &s;ucce&s;sfully begun. Nor did his love for the antiquities of his country con|fine his re&s;earches to its poetry alone: the &s;tructures of our ance&s;tors and their various improvements particu|larly engaged his attention. Hitherto there hath no|thing &s;o authentick and accurate on the &s;ubject of Go|thick architecture appeared as the ob&s;ervations upon it drawn up by Mr. Gray, and in&s;erted by Mr. Bentham in his Hi&s;t. of Ely. Of heraldry, its correlative &s;cience,
<PB N="xxi" REF="21">
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the entire knowledge. But of the various pur&s;uits which employed his &s;tudies for the la&s;t ten years of his life none were &s;o acceptable as tho&s;e which explained the economy of Nature. For botany he ac|quired a ta&s;te of his uncle when young; and the ex|erci&s;e which for the &s;ake of improvement in this branch of the &s;cience he induced him&s;elf to take con|tributed not a little to the pre&s;ervation of his health. How con&s;iderable his improvements in it were tho&s;e only can tell who have &s;een his additions to Hud&s;on, and his notes on Linnaeus. While confined to zoology he &s;ucce&s;sfully applied his di&s;coveries to illu&s;trate Ari|&s;totle and others of the Ancients. From engagements of this kind Mr. Gray's attention was neither often nor long diverted. Excepting the time he gave up to experiments on flowers, for the purpo&s;e of inve&s;tiga|ting the proce&s;s of vegetation, (which can &s;carcely be called a relaxation from his &s;tated occupations) his on|ly amu&s;ement was mu&s;ick; nor was his acquaintance with this art le&s;s than with others of much more im|portance. His &s;kill was acquired from the produc|tions of the be&s;t compo&s;ers, out of who&s;e works when in Italy he had made a &s;election. Vocal mu&s;ick he chiefly preferred. The harp&s;ichord was his favourite in&s;trument, but though far from remarkable for a fi|ni&s;hed execution, yet he accommodated his voice &s;o judiciou&s;ly to his playing as to give an auditor con|&s;iderable plea&s;ure. His judgment in &s;tatuary and painting was exqui&s;ite, and formed from an almo&s;t
<PB N="xxii" REF="22">
in&s;tinctive perception of tho&s;e graces beyond the reach of art in which the divine works of the great ma&s;ters abound. As it was through the un&s;olicited favour of the Duke of Grafton that Mr. Gray was en|abled to follow the bent of his own inclination in the choice of his &s;tudies, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find, from a letter to Dr. Beattie, that gratitude prompted him to offer his fir&s;tling:<Q><L>O Meliboee, Deus nobis haec otia fecit</L>
<L>Nanque erit ille mihi &s;emper Deus: illius aram</L>
<L>Saepe tener no&s;tris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.</L>
<L>Ille meas errare boves ut cernis, et ip&s;um</L>
<L>Ludere quae vellem, calamo permi&s;it agre&s;ti.</L></Q> Accordingly on his Grace's being elected Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity Mr. Gray, una&s;ked, took upon him to write tho&s;e ver&s;es which are u&s;ually &s;et to mu&s;ick on this occa&s;ion; and whatever the &s;arca&s;tick Junius (notwith&s;tanding his hand&s;ome compliment to the poet) might pretend, this was the offering of no ve|nal Mu&s;e. The ode in its &s;tructure is dramatick, and it contains nothing of the complimentary kind which is not entirely &s;uited to the characters employed. Not long after the bu&s;tle of the in&s;tallation was over Mr. Gray made an excur&s;ion to the &s;eque&s;tered lakes of We&s;tmoreland and Cumberland. The impre&s;&s;ions he there received from the wonderful &s;cenery that every where &s;urrounded him he tran&s;mitted to his friend Dr. Wharton in epi&s;tolary journals, with all the wild|ne&s;s of Salvator and the &s;oftne&s;s of Claude. Writing in May 1771 to the &s;ame friend, he complains of a
<PB N="xxiii" REF="23">
violent cough which had troubled him for three months, and which he called incurable, adding, that till this year he never knew what (mechancial) low &s;pirits were. One circum&s;tance that without doubt contributed to the latter complaint was the anxiety he felt from holding as a &s;inecure an office the du|ties of which he thought him&s;elf bound to perform. The object of his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip being twofold, and the patent allowing him to effect one of its de&s;igns by de|puty, it is under&s;tood that he liberally rewarded for that purpo&s;e the teachers in the Univer&s;ity of Italian and French. The other part he him&s;elf prepared to execute; but tho' the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip was in&s;tituted in 1724, none of his predece&s;&s;ors had furni&s;hed a plan. Embara&s;&s;ed by this and other difficulties, and re|tarded by ill health, the undertaking at length be|came &s;o irk&s;ome that he &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed to relin|qui&s;h the chair. Towards the clo&s;e of May he remo|ved from Cambridge to Town, after having &s;uffered from flying attacks of an hereditary gout, to which he had long been &s;ubject, and from which a life of &s;ingular temperance could not protect him. In Lon|don his indi&s;po&s;ition having increa&s;ed, the phy&s;ician advi&s;ed him to change his lodgings in Jermyn&s;treet for others at Ken&s;ington. This change was of &s;o much benefit that he was &s;oon enabled to return to Cam|bridge, from whence he meditated a journey to his friend Dr. Wharton, which he hoped might ree&s;tabli&s;h his health; but his intentions and hopes were delu&s;ive.
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24">
On the 24th of July 1771 a violent &s;ickne&s;s came on him while at dinner in the College-hall; the gout had fixed on his &s;tomach, and re&s;i&s;ted all the powers of medicine. On the 29th he was &s;eized by a &s;trong convul&s;ion, which the next day returned with addi|tional force, and the evening after he expired. At the fir&s;t &s;eizure he was aware of his danger, and tho' &s;en&s;ible at intervals almo&s;t to the la&s;t, he betrayed no dread of the terrours of death.</P>
<P>To delineate his portrait in this place would be needle&s;s. The reader will acquire the be&s;t idea of his character if after peru&s;ing his life and his writings he will u&s;e his own memory a sa cylindrick mirror, and collect into one a&s;&s;emblage the &s;cattered features. Of Mr Gray's religious opinions but little is known; there are however &s;ufficient traces left to &s;hew him a believer. To Lord Bolingbroke's athei&s;m he hath written an an&s;wer. His &s;entiments of Lord Safte&s;bury cannot be mi&s;taken; and both Voltaire and Hume he cen&s;ures with freedom. In private life he was mo&s;t re&s;pected by tho&s;e who be&s;t knew him: his heart was benevolent and his hand liberal.</P>
<P>On his poems it will be needle&s;s to be&s;tow prai&s;es, or to repel the attacks of envy and rancour. If Mr. Gray was not a poet of the fir&s;t order there is no poe|try exi&s;ting; and if his bold expre&s;&s;ions be non&s;en&s;e, &s;o are the be&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of Shake&s;peare and Milton, and the &s;ublime&s;t figures of divine in&s;piration.</P>

<P>IN the name of God. <HI>Amen.</HI> I Thomas Gray of Pem|broke-hall in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, being of &s;ound mind and in good health of body, yet ignorant how long the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings may be indulged me, do make this my La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament in manner and form following.

<P>THE Author once had thoughts (in concert with a friend) of giving a hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h poetry: in the introduction to it be meant to have produced &s;ome &s;pecimens of the &s;tyle that reigned in ancient times among the neighbouring na|tions, or tho&s;e who had &s;ubdued the greater part of this i&s;land, and were our progenitors: the following three imitations made a part of them. He afterwards dropped his de&s;ign; e&s;pecially after he had heard that it was al|ready in the hands of a per&s;on well qualified to do it ju|&s;tice both by his ta&s;te and his re&s;earches into antiquity.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the 11th century Sigurd, Earl of the Orkney-I&s;lands, went with a fleet of &s;hips and a con&s;iderable body of troops into Ireland to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Sigtryg with the &s;ilken beard,</HI> who was then making war on his father-in-law, Brian King of Dublin. The earl and all his forces were cut to pieces, and Sigtryg was in danger of a total defeat, but the enemy had a greater lo&s;s by the death of Brian their king, who fell in the action. On Chri&s;tma&s;day (the day of the battle) a native of Caithne&s;s in Scotland &s;aw, at a di&s;tance, a number of per&s;ons on hor&s;eback ri|ding full &s;peed towards a hill, and &s;eeming to enter into it. Curio&s;ity led him to follow them, till looking through an opening in the rocks be &s;aw twelve gigantick figures re&s;embling women: they were all employed about a loom, and as they wove they &s;ung the following dreadful &s;ong, which when they had fini&s;hed they tore the web into twelve pieces, and each taking her portion galloped &s;ix to the north, and as many to the &s;outh.</P>

<P>MR. GRAY's Flegy, previous to its publication, was handed about in m&s;. and had among&s;t other admirers the Lady Cobham, who re&s;ided in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e at Stoke-Pogeis.

Mr. Gray, &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a compliment, returned the vi&s;it; and as the beginning of this intercour&s;e bore &s;ome appearance of romance, he gave the humorous and lively account of it which the Long Story contains.</P>
