<L>_O YOU the Monarch's Bli&s;s, the Mu&s;e's Friend!</L>
<L>Accept the tribute Duty bids me &s;end:</L>
<L>'Tis what the Bard &s;hou'd long before have paid,</L>
<L>But fearful to a&s;pire, has long delay'd.</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> alone can <HI>Phoebus</HI>' Chariot guide,</L>
<L>The Youth who dar'd to drive it, daring dy'd.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">
My humble Mu&s;e can humble Subjects treat,</L>
<L>But trembles to attempt a Theme &s;o Great!</L>
<L>Yet warm with Gratitude, wou'd fain di&s;play</L>
<L>Her Zeal to you, on this au&s;picious Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To you! who&s;e gracious Goodne&s;s plumes her Wings,</L>
<L>By whom &s;he lives, by whom in&s;pir'd &s;he &s;ings;</L>
<L>Long may &s;he Celebrate your Sacred BIRTH;</L>
<L>Long may you &s;tay from Heav'n to ble&s;s the Earth:</L>
<L>To Chear the Royal Sov'reign of our ISLE;</L>
<L>Increa&s;e his Joys, or &s;often all his Toil,</L>
<L>Who now, while Death in purple Triumph reigns,</L>
<L>And &s;anguine Floods pollute the di&s;tant Plains,</L>
<L>Watchful o'er <HI>Britain</HI>'s Fate employs his Car,</L>
<L>Or wi&s;ely to avert, or bravely meet the War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Glorious QUEEN! by Nature form'd to bring</L>
<L>The &s;weete&s;t Comfort to the Ju&s;te&s;t KING:</L>
<L>Let proud Oppre&s;&s;ors, who abu&s;e their Pow'r,</L>
<L>Hear groaning Subjects cur&s;e their natal Hour.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5">
You, on that happy Hour, may ju&s;tly fea&s;t</L>
<L>Your Soul with Thoughts of making Thou&s;ands ble&s;s'd;</L>
<L>Who&s;e godlike Bounties, to the Wretched, &s;how,</L>
<L>You're only Pow'rful to relieve their Woe.</L>
</LG>

<L>What tho' the Mu&s;e old Annals &s;hould explore,</L>
<L>Mark all our Queens, and trace their Virtues o'er?</L>
<L>Where cou'd &s;he find &s;o much exalted Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>Nobly employ'd like your's, in Truth's Defence?</L>
<L>You &s;trive to make the Seeds of Virtue grow,</L>
<L>To &s;pread the Light which Heav'n reveal'd below:</L>
<L>Yet, free from &s;uper&s;titious Zeal, incline</L>
<L>To make the Rays of moral Goodne&s;s &s;hine,</L>
<L>Supporting tho&s;e, who firm to Truth, defend</L>
<L>That fir&s;t fix'd Law, on which all Laws depend.</L>

<L>Beneath your Influence, Art and Science rear</L>
<L>Their &s;acred Heads, and flouri&s;h by your Care;</L>

Lately your Bard &s;urvey'd the graceful Scene,</L>
<L>Ri&s;ing with Bounties of a Gen'rous QUEEN.</L>
<L>O! had the Mu&s;e there fledg'd her Infant Wing,</L>
<L>And early ta&s;ted of that learned Spring;</L>
<L>She then had &s;oar'd in more Heroic lays,</L>
<L>In more maje&s;tic Numbers &s;ung your Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>But fearful now, mu&s;t quit the glorious Theme,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t leave the Architect to &s;peak your Fame,</L>
