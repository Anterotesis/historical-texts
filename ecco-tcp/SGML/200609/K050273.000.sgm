<HEAD>THE
CASE of the War in <HI>ITALY</HI>
STATED: <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Eyes of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eem at
this time to be turn'd wholly
upon the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s New
Undertaking again&s;t the Em|peror.
The Rea&s;ons of his
making this Attempt, his Catholick Maje|&s;ty
has publi&s;hed by his Mini&s;ters, and the
Memorials, or Letters, which they have
given in to the &s;everal Courts of the Princes
where they re&s;ide, fully expre&s;s the Preten|&s;ion
of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Rea&s;ons
why he takes this Occa&s;ion to break with
the Emperor.</P>
<P>The&s;e Memorials, or Letters, are fir&s;t,
The Letter of Seignior <HI>Grimaldi,</HI> Secretary
of State to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> directed to
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, or Re&s;idents at
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Foreign Courts; Secondly, The Memorial
of the Marquis <HI>Beretti Landi,</HI> Mini&s;ter for
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to the States General,
and the Memorial of the Prince <HI>de Cellamere</HI>
at <HI>Paris,</HI> to the Regent of <HI>France,</HI> all on the
&s;ame Subject, and all tending to ju&s;tify the
Conduct of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in this Affair,
be&s;ides the declaration by word of Mouth
from the Marquis <HI>de Monteleone,</HI> the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
of <HI>Spain,</HI> to his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje|&s;ty.</P>
<P>The &s;um of all the&s;e Memorials, for they
are too long to repeat here, may be drawn
up and abridg'd in the following Heads,
<HI>viz.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That the Emperor does not acknow|ledge
King <HI>Philip</HI> to be King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but
gives him only the Title of Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI>
a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the stile and Dignity
of King of <HI>Spain, Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, like|wi&s;e
all the Titles attending the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; that He (the
Emperor) whom the King of <HI>Spain</HI> there|fore
calls only <HI>Arch Duke,</HI> has Erected a
Council at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which he calls the Coun|cil
of <HI>Spain</HI>; That he Confers Titles and
Honours, &s;uch as Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> as if
he was really King of <HI>Spain</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and the like.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> That the&s;e things are Evedences of
his re&s;olving to attack King <HI>Philip,</HI> and
Chace him out of <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf if he was able,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
or when he &s;hall be &s;o; and in the mean
time, takes all Occa&s;ions to &s;hew him&s;elf a
mortal Enemy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<HI>dly,</HI> That the Emperor Broke the Terms
of Peace and Neutrality, even as &s;oon as
they were made, <HI>viz.</HI> That when (his Im|perial
Maje&s;ty) con&s;ented by Treaty to quit
<HI>Catalonia,</HI> where in a few Days more he
mu&s;t have been overcome, and been redu|ced
to the nece&s;&s;ity of having fallen into the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Hands; yet he did not quit
the Towns and Strengths, as he ought to
have done, by Con&s;igning them into the
King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Hands, to whom they were
to be &s;urrendred, but gave them over to the
Rebels the <HI>Catalans,</HI> encouraging them to
hold out again&s;t his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, by pro|mi&s;ing
to return and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, which occa|&s;ion'd
the &s;hedding of much Blood, and the
Expen&s;e of an Infinite ma&s;s of Trea&s;ure, to
reduce tho&s;e Places to Obedience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4<HI>thly,</HI> That he not only encourag'd the
Rebel <HI>Majorkins</HI> in their Rebellion again&s;t
his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, but actually &s;ent them
Ships, Men, Money, Arms, Provi&s;ions,
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;upport them in their
Rebellion again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI>; Ex|horting
them al&s;o to maintain their Rebelli|on,
in hopes of farther A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5<HI>thly,</HI> That the Imperial Governor of
the <HI>Milane&s;e,</HI> has, by order from the Em|peror,
Arre&s;ted, and put in Pri&s;on, the
Abbot <HI>Molinez,</HI> a Per&s;on Sacred by his Cha|racter
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of Grand Inqui&s;itor, Reverend by his
Age, and who ought to have been &s;o by the
Pa&s;ports which were given him at <HI>Rome</HI> from
the Pope, with Approbation of Count <HI>Gallas</HI>
the Imperial Mini&s;ter there; and la&s;tly,
who having given no Offence in Per&s;on to
the Emperor, is vi&s;ibly Arre&s;ted, as an Af|front
to his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, and an In&s;ult
upon his Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6<HI>thly,</HI> That his Imperial Maje&s;ty has him|&s;elf
broken the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> by ex|torting
Immen&s;e Sums of Money from the
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> on pretence of its being
their ju&s;t Due to pay towards the carrying on
His War again&s;t the <HI>Turks.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>And <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That this being a particular
Conjuncture for the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Purpo&s;e,
favourable for his De&s;igns, and the like, his
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty thinks he cannot let &s;lip &s;o
fair an Occa&s;ion, as well re&s;pecting the
Troubles in <HI>Hungary,</HI> as the general Di&s;con|tent
of the People of <HI>Italy,</HI> and their readi|ne&s;s
to enter into Mea&s;ures, for the effectu|al
delivering them&s;elves out of the Hands of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are the General Heads of the
Charge, as may be &s;een by the &s;aid Memo|rials
or Manife&s;toes of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters,
to which I refer, they having all been made
publick in the common Printed Papers of the
Town, as to the pretence of the Emperor
u&s;ing Artifices to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="5" REF="6">
to the E&s;tates of the Grand Duke of
<HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> That I look upon as Trifling and
without Foundation, and therefore not
worth naming among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire here,
whether the&s;e Objections are ju&s;t, and whe|ther
what is Alledged can be made good in
Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Emperor has done &s;o
and &s;o, as above: Nor is it the pre&s;ent
Que&s;tion, whether if the&s;e Allegations are
ju&s;t, they are a &s;ufficient Argument for the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> to take up Arms, and begin
a War in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But the De&s;ign of this Tract, is to En|quire
how the&s;e things re&s;pect the other
Powers of Chri&s;tendom; and what Part it
is probable they may take in the Quarrel;
and by other Powers here, I am to be under|&s;tood,
to mean in particular the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> the King of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> and the Cantons of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI>
what &s;hare they are like to have in the
Quarrel, and whether they are bound by
the Treaty of Neutrality to Concern them|&s;elves
in a War for the keeping the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of <HI>Italy</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> yea,
or no.</P>
<P>I begin with the King of <HI>Sicily.</HI> To make
&s;hort with his Story, I &s;hall look on him
as one of the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> for &s;uch he
<PB N="6" REF="7">
is: We &s;ee his Maje&s;ty acting a very
&s;ubtle Part, as indeed it &s;tands him in &s;tead
at this time to do. It is true, the <HI>Im|periali&s;ts</HI>
threaten him, and notwith&s;tand|ing
all his Prote&s;tations of being re&s;olved
to pur&s;ue the Neutrality, they mi&s;tru&s;t
him, and &s;eem as re&s;olv'd to fall on him in
their Way; nay, &s;ome &s;ay, they re&s;olve to
begin with him. No Man will be &s;o weak
as to ask what is his <HI>Sicilian</HI> Maje&s;ty's Bu|&s;ine&s;s
if he is attack'd; but the Que&s;tion
with him &s;eems to be, whether his Maje&s;ty
having now a very great Army on Foot, in
a Readine&s;s for Action, and apprehending
the Imperiali&s;ts will certainly attack him,
ought not, by way of Prevention, to begin
fir&s;t, having &s;o clear an Advantage, and an
Opportunity, which it is very probable,
may not be offer'd again, I mean, as that
of joyning with <HI>Spain?</HI></P>
<P>This is the Que&s;tion which the Politicians
who con&s;ider not what is right, or what is
wrong, but what is fitte&s;t to be done, re&s;pe|cting
the Intere&s;t of the Party; I &s;hall in
brief &s;tate what I think will be the
Ca&s;e here, and as therein I give only one
Opinion, let others judge as they &s;ee Cau&s;e,
and let the Event determine. In a Word,
I &s;ay, I think it &s;eems unavoidable, and the
King of <HI>Sicily</HI> cannot be unconcern'd in a
War, if it follows, and that his Maje&s;ty
will not fail to oyn his Arms with the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
K. of <HI>Spain</HI>; only that this cannot be expected
till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have landed a con&s;iderable
Body of Men on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> either
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> or perhaps high|er
up, towards the King of <HI>Sicily</HI>'s own
Country, which is more than probable, by
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General's demanding Pa&s;&s;age
of the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> for an Army into
the <HI>Parme&s;an.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore being &s;o near a Deci&s;ion,
and at pre&s;ent, repre&s;enting it &s;elf to our
View as unavoidable, I lay it down as a
thing mo&s;t certain, either voluntarily of
him&s;elf, or forced by the Imperiali&s;ts them|&s;elves,
will certainly joyn with <HI>Spain</HI> in this
new Enterprize; and I mu&s;t tell the Impe|rial
Mini&s;ters, who talk &s;o loudly of the
Certainty of the King of <HI>Sicily</HI>'s Ruin in
&s;uch a Ca&s;e, and let the Event be what it
will, there is great Rea&s;on to believe, ma|ny,
if not all the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;eem to
re&s;olve to run the Venture of it, if the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
give them but a little more Encourage|ment.
What their Dependence and Encou|ragement
are, Time will not fail to di&s;co|ver.</P>
<P>I
will not &s;ay, but the&s;e Princes may have
their &s;everal Grievances, and may have ju&s;t
Rea&s;ons to complain of the Violences and
Oppre&s;&s;ions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> I am
willing in Compliment to their Integrity, to
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;uppo&s;e, tho' not to grant, the Imperial
Governours have perhaps exceeded their
Commi&s;&s;ions, or that even their Commi&s;|&s;ions
have been in &s;ome things inva&s;ive of
the Right of the &s;everal Powers complain|ing,
contrary to Ju&s;tice, and to a Treaty of
Neutrality; and I will give the&s;e Complaints
their full Weight, when I come to examine
the grand Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether for
this they ought to take up Arms, and de|&s;troy
the Neutrality, in which the pre&s;er|ving
their Rights is not the only Que&s;tion;
but by which the Ballance of Power in
<HI>Europe</HI> is pre&s;erv'd: In which Ballance of
Power, mo&s;t, if not all the other Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> are concern'd, at lea&s;t tho&s;e Powers
are, of whom I am more particularly to
&s;peak.</P>
<P>In this Circum&s;tance then I lay down the
State of things in <HI>Italy,</HI> at this time, <HI>viz.</HI>
That the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> are in a pre&s;ent
Di&s;po&s;ition to Revolt, and that the King of
<HI>Sicily</HI> is in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, and that they on|ly
want a powerful Protection of &s;ome other
Potentate to &s;upport them, and that there|fore
we may expect, if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> ap|pears
thus able to protect them, they will
certainly joyn with him whenever a pow|erful
Army appears.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Preten&s;ions then, and
the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> being thus &s;tated, the
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Plot among them &s;eems to be di&s;cover'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> on the Foun|dation
of his own Grievances only, &s;hall be|gin
the War, and according to the Succe&s;s
his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty meets with, the other
Princes &s;hall declare them&s;elves; &s;o that if
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould not be able to car|ry
on the De&s;ign, they may all retreat to
their Solemn Prote&s;tations of not being con|cern'd
in the Quarrel of <HI>Spain,</HI> and may
make &s;mooth Water with the Emperour,
when they find them&s;elves unable to rai&s;e a
Storm: But on the contrary, if the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> can force his Way into <HI>Italy,</HI> and di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s
the Imperiali&s;ts, &s;o as to protect them,
then they will declare them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot I &s;hall treat the Affair
in general; if I do any Wrong to the
Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> it will be time to acknow|ledge
it when the Wrong appears.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the Hi&s;tory of Fact:
The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> according to this Scheme,
has begun the War, and &s;erving him&s;elf, of
the Emperor's being perfectly de&s;titute of a|ny
Marine Power, and of the unhappy Con|juncture
of a furious War with the <HI>Turks,</HI>
he invades the Dominions of his Imperial
Maje&s;ty, in particular, the I&s;land of <HI>Sardig|nia,</HI>
which the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having a power|ful
Fleet, and the Imperial Government not
<PB N="10" REF="11">
three Men of War, could no ways be re|liev'd.</P>
<P>Here
we &s;top a while, and make a Tran|&s;ition
at once to the Courts of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and the <HI>Hague.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were not &s;o
ignorant, as not to know, or &s;o dull, as not
to think of it; That the Powers or Courts
above mentioned, who had all &s;everally &s;o
great a Share in making the Capitulation, or
Treaty for the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> would
intere&s;t them&s;elves in this Affair, as having
charg'd them&s;elves with the Guarantee of
that Neutrality, and therefore his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty caus'd, not only the Letters and
Memorials mentioned above, to be pre|&s;ented
in the Nature of Manife&s;to's to the
&s;aid Courts, but made often a repeated Pro|po&s;al
of &s;topping their Proceedings, till time
might be given to the pacifick Princes and
Powers, who he thus appply'd to by &s;uch
Methods as they thought mo&s;t proper to
bring his Imperial Maje&s;ty to li&s;ten to Rea|&s;on,
and to do Ju&s;tice to his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty's
Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e Propo&s;als being taken <HI>Ad Referen|dum,</HI>
did indeed entitle the &s;aid Princes and
Powers to make the needful Repre&s;entations
to the Emperor, and to make u&s;e of all the
good Offices they found for their Purpo&s;e,
to induce the Emperor to refer likewi&s;e the
Matters in Di&s;pute to their Mediation, as
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> likewi&s;e offer'd to do.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
By the way, I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve as I
go, in order to make every thing clear to
the Reader of this Enquiry. 1. That the&s;e
Powers were more or le&s;s, all of them en|gag'd
before as Guarantees of the Treaty of
Neutrality in <HI>Italy.</HI> 2. That tho' their be|ing
&s;o Guarantees qualified them the better
to be Mediators; yet this Mediation, if they
had accepted it, does not by any Means
tye up their Hands from, or le&s;&s;en the
Right they have to act as Guarantees of the
Neutrality of <HI>Italy.</HI> 3. That we do not find
in the Propo&s;al, any Conditions made with
them, that this Offer &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t on|ly
in ca&s;e they declar'd them&s;elves accepting
the &s;aid Mediation. 4. We do not find that
the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> their High Migh|tine&s;&s;es
the States General, and the Regent
of <HI>France,</HI> did actually engage in any &s;uch
Mediation. But 5. that being willing to do
all good Offices, for the pre&s;erving the
Peace and Tranquility of <HI>Europe,</HI> they have
concerned them&s;elves, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t
Manner to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, in what the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> demands, and to induce him
to accept of the Propo&s;als of his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty, in Order to a Treaty.</P>
<P>But while this is depending, and before
they have been able to obtain any An&s;wer,
or enter into any Negociation on the Pro|po&s;al,
we find <HI>Spain</HI> entirely regardle&s;s of
the offer'd Su&s;pen&s;ion of her Conque&s;ts, and
<PB N="12" REF="13">
taking no Notice of the Engagements &s;he
had enter'd into with his <HI>Britanncik</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
and other Powers, as above? I &s;ay,
we find <HI>Spain</HI> vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hing on her
Advantages, making Preparations for new
Enterprizes, and even by her Amba&s;&s;ador,
the Prince <HI>de Cellamare,</HI> at the Court of
<HI>France,</HI> declaring publickly, that &s;he in|tends
to do &s;o; this la&s;t Declaration being
indeed &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e mentioned
above, de&s;erves to be remark'd as follows;
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE loo&s;e Rumours, and the &s;ur|prizing
News, which have been
current &s;ome time &s;ince at this Court, as
well as in the other Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that
the King my Ma&s;ter, de&s;igned for &s;ome
&s;ecret Enterprize, the Ships and Troops
which he had a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to|gether
with the In&s;tances, continual Re|pre&s;entations,
and extraordinary Applica|cations
made at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> by the
<HI>German</HI> Mini&s;ters and their Friends, who
were alarm'd upon the fir&s;t Advice of &s;uch
an Enterprize, out of a Remor&s;e of their
own Con&s;cience, have kept me to this
time under an Unea&s;ine&s;s, which your
Excellency, who knows &s;ufficiently my
Zeal for the Glory of the King my Ma&s;ter,
and how devoted I am to his Service, may
ea&s;ily imagine, as well as the extreme A|gitation
tho&s;e Rumours have produc'd in
<PB N="13" REF="14">
me; but that Trouble was throughly
calmed, by a Letter which I received
from Mon&s;ieur the Marquis <HI>Grimaldo,</HI>
whereof I have annexed a Copy to this
Memorial, which I have the Honour to
deliver to your Excellency.</P>
<P>I have the Satisfaction to &s;ee therein
the Rea&s;ons that have induced the King
my Ma&s;ter, to undertake to recover <HI>Sar|dignia</HI>
by Force of Arms, &s;et forth in &s;uch
a manner, as ought to per&s;wade all the
World of the Ju&s;tice of this Expedition.
My Penetration, tho' not very exten&s;ive,
had already afforded me a Glym&s;pe of the
Solidity of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, which are groun|ded
on the Infractions made by the Court
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> of the &s;olemn Treaties for the
Evacuation of <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Majorca,</HI> and
the Non-performance of the Conditions
on which the Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Arms in
<HI>Italy</HI> had been concluded. Such Contra|ventions
can never be forgotten!</P>
<P>I put therefore into the Hands of your
Excellency, a Copy of the Letter of M.
the Marquis <HI>Grimaldo,</HI> that you may be
entirely and fully por&s;waded of the Ju|&s;tice
of the Arms of his Catholick Ma|je&s;ty,
and be able more exactly to acquaint
the Regency therewith. I cannot add any
thing to that Letter, but a Reflection, <HI>viz.</HI>
That as the King my Ma&s;ter, has forbore
hitherto to attack the Arch-Duke in the
Dominions he has u&s;urp'd from him, up|on
<PB N="14" REF="15">
two Motives, equally wi&s;e and impor|tant;
&s;o he does not do it at pre&s;ent but
at the utmo&s;t Extremity, and after the
Archduke has violated all the Regards due
to Crowned Heads, and after he has put
upon him the Affront of &s;eizing with Vio|lence
the Great Inqui&s;itor of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Motive is, that the King my
Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Courage and Greatne&s;s of
Soul are worthy of his Birth and his Throne,
re&s;ents much more what wounds his Dig|nity
than the Enterprizes that are made
chiefly again&s;t his Intere&s;t, of which I am
an unexceptionable Witne&s;s, having &s;een
to what a degree his generous Courage was
provoked, when he heard the unju&s;t Vio|lence
and odious U&s;age &s;uffer'd &s;ince the
lo&s;s of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the
Pri&s;ons of <HI>Milan,</HI> on the Part of the <HI>Ger|mans,</HI>
by the Viceroy the Marquis de <HI>Vil|lena,</HI>
and the other General Officers, who
&s;erv'd under him, among&s;t whom I have
the ine&s;timable Glory to have been di|&s;tingui&s;hed
by a particular Attention of the
Enemies of the King my Ma&s;ter, to abu&s;e
me.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will immediately per|ceive

to come, and that it will be a great many
years before we can po&s;&s;ibly give &s;uch Ea&s;e
to the poor People, as to bring their living,
and keeping their Families, to be as Cheap
to them as before, and yet their Provi&s;ions
are even dearer than in time of War: That
all neighbouring Countries are reducing
their Expence and le&s;&s;ening their Debts,
and in a fair way to be out of Debt before
us, even tho' no new War &s;hould be Com|menced:
But that every year brings with it
&s;ome new load upon <HI>Britain</HI> to keep her low,
as for Example, the Rebellion for one Year,
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Affair for another, and if now
we Engage in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> we are in

<P>To all the&s;e things, they add the &s;uppo&s;i|tion

of it to our Commerce, which after a
long Decay, and &s;uffering infinite Convul|&s;ions
in the la&s;t War, began to revive again
in all parts of the World; but will imme|diately
be overwhelm'd in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
parts of it, &s;uch as the Trade to <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf,
the A&s;&s;iento Contract, the Trade to <HI>Italy,</HI>

This is a long Detail of plau&s;ibles, which

the Nation wants a rece&s;s of Taxes; it is

the Effects of our Merchants are Great

<P>I'll add to this, That we have Rea&s;on to
believe from the Wi&s;dom, and the pacifick
Di&s;po&s;ition of His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, from
the Prudence and Moderation of his Coun|cils,
from the ju&s;t De&s;ire the King mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily

<P>But again&s;t all the&s;e Things, doubtle&s;s
there are other matters that weigh &s;ome|thing
in the Scale of this Que&s;tion, and
which merit to be con&s;idered by them&s;elves;
I &s;hall fetch nothing remote to make good

even at fir&s;t &s;ight, if we go back Hi&s;to|rically
but a little way into things pa&s;t,
and compare them with the vi&s;ible pro|&s;pects
of things to come.</P>
<P>The Great, and indeed the true Rea&s;on,
which was always alleg'd for the pu&s;hing
on the late War at &s;o va&s;t an Expence, and
the continuing it thro' &s;o many Difficulties,
as at fir&s;t for many years ob&s;tructed the Suc|ce&s;s
of it, was the fixing the Ballance of
Power in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this, That &s;o many Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> Confederated to reduce the Exorbi|tant
Power of <HI>France,</HI> by who&s;e Conque&s;ts
and Ambitious De&s;igns that Ballance was
de&s;troyed, and the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> in
Danger of &s;ubmitting at la&s;t to an Univer|&s;al
Tyranny in the Conqueror.</P>
<P>It was for this that the Glorious King <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
fix'd the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty, as the boun|dary
of his Demands from <HI>France</HI>; and de|clar'd,
if <HI>Spain</HI> went beyond tho&s;e limits, he
would be then as much a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> as he
was then a <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this that &s;uch long Struggles
were made to prevent the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy
falling into the Hands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bour|bon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="24">
It was for this we Complain'd &s;o warmly
of the Mea&s;ures in the la&s;t Reign, and of the
Conditions of the late Peace, as betraying
the Confederacy, and de&s;troying the Great
End of the War, by giving up <HI>Spain</HI> to King
<HI>Philip,</HI> who at that time was entirely in the
Intere&s;t of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>It was for this all the Renunciations of the
Treaty of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> were entred into, and the
weight of the Argument acknowledg'd, even
in tho&s;e very things which were &s;aid Eventu|ally
to betray it, and by tho&s;e very People
who have been &s;o openly Charg'd with lea|ving
it unprovided for, or not &s;ufficiently &s;e|cur'd.</P>
<P>It
was on the Pretence of this being &s;uf|ficiently
&s;ecur'd, that the People who made
the Peace of <HI>&V;trecht</HI> ju&s;tify them&s;elves, and
tell us that it was a good Peace, and that it
fully an&s;wered the end of the War.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t then follow, that even tho&s;e very
People ought to be the fir&s;t to declare, that
what ever Prince breaks in upon that Bal|lance,
De&s;troys the Efficacy of the Peace,
and brings us into the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of re|newing
a War, that there was at that time
for Beginning and Carrying it on.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="25">
As the Ballance of Power was the Rea&s;on
of the War, &s;o it is the only Ba&s;is of the
Peace; whatever Prince makes an attempt
upon that Ballance, declares War again&s;t all
the re&s;t, as they are naturally Guarantees of
the whole; or el&s;e they tacitly declare that
there was no ju&s;t Rea&s;on at fir&s;t, from the
Interruption of that Ballance, to begin the
former War, much le&s;s to carry it on as they
did, which would Arraign all the Princes of
the Confederacy, and Charge them with
Ambition, Unju&s;t Inva&s;ion, and Blood.</P>
<P>The&s;e Points carry their own Evidence
with them, and admit &s;o little di&s;pute, that
it would &s;eem a meer &s;pinning out our Di&s;|cour&s;e,
to go about proving, or farther ex|plaining
any part of them; all the publick
Tran&s;actions, Declarations of War, Memo|rials
and Treaties, which were &s;everally di|&s;pers'd
thro' <HI>Europe</HI> in the Time when the&s;e
things were done, are full of it, and may be all
call'd up as Evidences to this one Great Prin|ciple
of the Policies of <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> That
Pre&s;erving the Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI>
was the Rea&s;on of the War, and the Grand
Preliminary of the Peace.</P>
<P>This then being laid down as a Funda|mental
to argue from, it follows to enquire
in few Words, Is the di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> of their Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="26">
reuniting tho&s;e Dominions to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Monarchy, a Breach of this Ballance of
Power, or is it not?</P>
<P>I need go no further for Arguments to &s;et
forth the Importance of tho&s;e <HI>Italian</HI> Domi|nions,
than tho&s;e made u&s;e of by the Gen|tlemen,
who magnified them as mo&s;t mighty
Additions to the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Greatne&s;s, when
they would have per&s;waded us, that giving
tho&s;e Parts to the Emperor, would make
him too great for the re&s;t of the World, and
overthrow that Ballance they were given
to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>If then tho&s;e Dominions, who&s;e Depen|dencies
and Influencies are indeed equal to
their Power, were &s;carce thought &s;afe to be
given to the Emperor, and were not thought
&s;afe to remain to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e
of the Ballance, which would thereby be
in Danger; How then can it con&s;i&s;t with
the Ballance, to have them &s;natch'd out of
the Emperor's Hands again, and return
back to the &s;ame Hand from whence they
were taken?</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration alone, obliges not
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> only, but even the whole
Confederacy, as one Man, to Declare again&s;t
this Inva&s;ion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to
oblige him to put a Stop to his Attempts,
<PB N="32" REF="27">
or make War upon him; otherwi&s;e, the End
of the late War is defeated, and the Effect
of the late Peace is de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, the Emperor
had tho&s;e Dominions conquer'd for him,
and put into his Hands, and he ought to
take Care to maintain his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for, if
the Emperor is, by any Incident of War,
<HI>as the pre&s;ent War with the</HI> Turks, <HI>for Ex|ample,</HI>
expos'd to the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Surprize,
it would &s;hew a very ill Concern for the
general Good of <HI>Europe,</HI> to let his Domini|ons,
which we thought our &s;elves &s;o much
concern'd to get for him, be lo&s;t again, be|cau&s;e
he (the Emperor) may not be able to
prevent it.</P>
<P>It was for our own Sakes, and for the
Publick Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> in which the whole
Confederacy were concern'd, that the War
was carried on; it was not to aggrandize
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that the&s;e Dominions
were conquer'd, but to weaken the oppo|&s;ing
Enemies, who&s;e Power was too great;
and they were allotted to the Emperor, not
becau&s;e his Arms had Conquer'd them, for
without the Help of the Confederates, he
neither did conquer them, nor could have
Conquer'd them; but becau&s;e it was meet,
in Order to pre&s;erve this great Article of the
Ballance, I &s;ay, it was meet for the Good
<PB N="25" REF="28">
of all <HI>Europe</HI> that the Emperor &s;hould have
them.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e &s;peaking of the pre&s;ent Con|juncture,
it is not meerly in Compliment to
the Emperor, who&s;e immediate Intere&s;t or
Family, we have no Concern in, that we
are intere&s;ted in this Affair; but it is the
common Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> the &s;ame which &s;o
many Years War was carried on for, and the
&s;ame which the Peace was; or ought to have
been made for: For this common Intere&s;t
it is meet that the&s;e Places, the&s;e Domini|ons
in <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;hould remain to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI>; and they mu&s;t remain to that
Hou&s;e, or that Ballance be &s;o far de&s;troy'd,
and the Ends of the Confederates are not
an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>It remains then to judge, whether <HI>Great
Britain</HI> can quietly and unconcernedly look
on, and &s;ee the great Ends for which they
laid out their Blood and Trea&s;ure with &s;o
much Chearfulne&s;s, and for &s;o many Years,
de&s;troy'd at once, and a Foundation laid
for the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity of Blood and Trea|&s;ure
to be laid out again? Can we &s;it &s;till,
and &s;ee Mea&s;ures taken, which have in
them&s;elves a direct Tendency to renew the
War? Tho&s;e pacifick Gentlemen who plead
&s;o earne&s;tly in Behalf of Peace, &s;hould tell
us the Meaning of the ancient well known
<PB N="26" REF="29">
Maxim, <HI>Pax quaeretur Bello,</HI> and whether
a timely Exerting the Strength which is
now in our Hands, may not be the only Way
to e&s;tabli&s;h Peace, and prevent War?</P>
<P>It is much ea&s;ier to keep things in the
Po&s;ture they are in, than to re&s;tore them
again after the Blow is given; <HI>Italy</HI> is a
large Country, a Conjuncture offers to the
ambitious Views of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which
perhaps may be in it &s;elf tempting enough;
the delicious Mor&s;el, &s;eems, as it were,
dropping into his Mouth; the Di&s;contents
of the People there are repre&s;ented as very
great, and perhaps they are &s;o; it may be,
the <HI>Germans</HI> have not treated them very
kindly, they have oppre&s;s'd them with
heavy Taxes, preferr'd Foreigners to the
Places and Preferments which the Natives
have claim'd a Right to, carried away their
Native Troops to &s;erve the Emperor in
his Wars in <HI>Hungary,</HI> Extorted great Sums
of Money and the like: What can we &s;ay
to this, had they applied to any Foreign
Princes to have interceeded for them to
his Imperial Maje&s;ty, none of the Con|federates
would have refus'd their good
<HI>Offices,</HI> as far as the Cu&s;tom of Nations
would admit one Prince to concern him&s;elf
in the Government of another: But that
the&s;e Grievances &s;hould entitle them to Re|volt,
and to go back to a Prince from whom
<PB N="27" REF="30">
the whole Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> was concern'd
to &s;eparate them; This quite alters the
Ca&s;e: And to &s;ay we mu&s;t &s;it &s;till, and per|mit
and &s;uffer it, as we have acted in the
&s;ame kind our &s;elves, and from the Princi|ples
of Liberty we in&s;i&s;t upon for our &s;elves,
this is &s;aying nothing to the purpo&s;e, for
our Views are in this the Liberties of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
and not the Liberties of <HI>Italy</HI>; the
fir&s;t we are Nationally concern'd in, not the
la&s;t: Nay, if they were together in one
bottom, we &s;hould no otherwi&s;e be con|cern'd
in the Liberties of <HI>Italy,</HI> than as they
were on one bottom with tho&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI>;
but when they are oppo&s;ite to one another,
the Ca&s;e is quite alter'd. The particular
Rights of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes or People are
quite out of the que&s;tion; the thing be|fore
the Confederates is, the pre&s;erving that
Ballance, which is the Foundation of the
Liberties of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can we &s;ay in this Ca&s;e that the Con|federacy
is Di&s;&s;olv'd, and the Affair is now
no more a Common Concern: The Com|mon
Intere&s;t is the &s;ame, and the Princes,
as I &s;aid, even Natural Guarrantees for
the pre&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid here for the Nature
of this War, the Inju&s;tice of the manner,
as well as that of the pretences for it: But
<PB N="28" REF="31">
it is true, the&s;e regard the Emperor rather

Some of them are to be found in the Pope's
Letter to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> where his
Holine&s;s expo&s;tulates warmly, and even
almo&s;t calls it perfidious Treatment, <HI>viz.</HI>
1. That his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty promi&s;es and
engages his Royal Word, to him the Pope,
that he would not offer any Di&s;turbance to
his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Dominions in <HI>Italy,</HI>
during his being thus engag'd in a War
with the <HI>Turks.</HI> 2. That his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
engaged to his Holine&s;s, to &s;end a
powerful Fleet into the <HI>Levant,</HI> in Aid of
the Chri&s;tian Princes again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI>
which Fleet was to joyn the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and
act in Conjunction with the other Auxili|aries;
whereas, on the contrary, this Fleet
was not only not &s;ent to the <HI>Levant</HI> again&s;t
the <HI>Turks,</HI> but has been employ'd again&s;t
the Chri&s;tian Emperor, at the &s;ame time
when his Imperial Maje&s;ty had employ'd
his whole Force to re&s;i&s;t the Enemy of the
Chri&s;tian Name, and not only has been
thus employ'd; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> have been
thereby abandon'd, and left to &s;truggle with
the &s;uperior Force of their Enemies, to
<PB N="29" REF="32">
their great and un&s;peakable Lo&s;s and Di&s;ap|pointment,
and to the great Hazard of Chri|&s;tendom;
and the <HI>Turks</HI> being hereby left
Ma&s;ters of the Seas, after two bloody En|gagements;
which had the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet
been joyn'd, would either not have been
fought, or if they had, the Chri&s;tans might
have obtain'd a mo&s;t glorious Victory, or
at lea&s;t, the Triumphs of the Infidels had
been prevented, and the Effu&s;ion of the
Chri&s;tian Blood been &s;aved. 3. That in
order to this Equipment for the Service of
Chri&s;tendom, his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty demand|ed
of his Holine&s;s, a Brief for the rai&s;ing
a great Sum of Money from the Clergy
of <HI>Spain,</HI> which his Holine&s;s granted.
Likewi&s;e, a Hat was in&s;i&s;ted for the Ab|bot,

the like here; wherein his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
offers, or promi&s;es to &s;top his Prepa|rations,
and proceed no farther than the
Conque&s;t of <HI>Sardignia,</HI> but leave the Mat|ters
in Di&s;pute with the Emperor, to the
Mediation of his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty, and
their High Mightine&s;&s;es the States Gene|ral,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet, as all Advices now
&s;ay, and even the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Mi|ni&s;ter
in <HI>France</HI> acknowledges, his <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty re&s;olves to pu&s;h his Advan|tages
to the utmo&s;t, in Pur&s;uit of his
Quarrel with the Emperor.</P>
<P>I am loth to make indecent Reflections
upon Per&s;ons exalted to the Dignity of
Sovereign Princes, and always retain a
Reverence to the Maje&s;ty of Crown'd
Heads; and therefore, forbear all tho&s;e
Reflections which &s;ome People make upon
his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, as a Branch of the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> &s;ugge&s;ting that &s;uch
things as the&s;e &s;eem to be Copying after
the Pattern of <HI>France.</HI> I wi&s;h his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty would adhere to the Maxims of
<PB N="31" REF="34">
Honour, &s;o &s;trictly adher'd to, and &s;o no|bly
practis'd by &s;ome of his glorious An|ce&s;tors
on the Throne of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy,
rather than &s;end us back to his
particular Progenitors, or to a Court,
where &s;uch things have formerly been too
much practis'd; and which I mention with
the more Caution, as the World &s;eems to
acknowledge, the Court of <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf
is acted now by other Principles, and
may be expected, in a few Years, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
other Maxims, as well of Policy as
of Honour, differing from tho&s;e which
brought it &s;o eminently to the Gate of
De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;ee nothing can be &s;aid then why the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould be &s;uffer'd unoppo&s;ed,
to pu&s;h on his pre&s;ent De&s;igns, which are
founded on &s;uch Trifling pretences, and on
&s;uch Di&s;honourable Mea&s;ures, unle&s;s we
can &s;ay, that we have no Concern in the
General G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">od of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that we are not
as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oncern'd to keep any new Power
from Growing too Formidable and Exorbi|tant
in <HI>Europe,</HI> as we &s;hall be afterwards to
pull it down; and if it will be our Con|cern,
as mo&s;t certainly it mu&s;t, to reduce
every Exorbitance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI>
and pre&s;erve the Ballance on which the
Tranquility of <HI>Europe</HI> Depends, it mu&s;t be
our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rudence to prevent the fir&s;t ri&s;e of &s;uch
Exorbitance.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35">
As to the di&s;advantages to our Commerce
Abroad, our inability to Engage in the Ex|pence
at Home, our being in Debt, and
oppre&s;s'd with Taxes, and the like, they are
all Granted, and I make no doubt, that as
it is natural to infer from thence, that we
&s;hould by no Means Engage in any New
Expence if it be po&s;&s;ible to avoid it; &s;o I
believe, as is &s;aid above, That His Maje&s;ty
will not be prevail'd on to u&s;e Force in this
Ca&s;e, if all po&s;&s;ible Good Offices between
the Parties can prevent it, and if Rea&s;on
will take place; in a Word, that His Ma|je&s;ty
will not bring us into a War without an
ab&s;olute and apparent Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But let us not Depreciate our Country &s;o
much, or lay our &s;elves &s;o low neither, as
to &s;ugge&s;t that we cannot do, what we
cannot in Honour and Ju&s;tice avoid; that
would be to &s;ay, We are &s;o weakned by the
late War, that we are not able even to re|&s;i&s;t
an Enemy, if we are Attack'd.</P>
<P>If our Power is Contemn'd if the Ho|nour
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown is &s;lighted, if
Princes come to think &s;o meanly of <HI>Britain,</HI>
as not to think it worth while to keep their
Words with us, it is indeed attacking us:
They that will break their Promi&s;es with
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> How long do we think they
would be before they would break the Peace
<PB N="33" REF="36">
with his Maje&s;ty, if they found it for their
advantage to do it?</P>
<P>To be Treated thus, is to be attack'd in
the wor&s;t manner, and Great Princes have
always re&s;ented the breach of Faith with
them, as the wor&s;t Affront that could be
put upon them; and I hope, none will &s;ug|ge&s;t
in this Ca&s;e, that a Breach of Faith
with the King, is not a Breach of Faith
with the Kingdom, and that in a manner
more particularly provoking.</P>
<P>As to our Trade, perhaps it may be true,
that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> may take &s;ome ad|vantages
again&s;t our Merchants; but let
&s;uch People who are frighted at tho&s;e ap|pearances,
remember what infinite Advan|tages
our &s;uperiority at Sea gives our Sub|jects
in War with <HI>Spain</HI>; let them remem|ber
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the
whole Nation was vi&s;ibly enrich'd by a War
with <HI>Spain</HI>; and to this, let me add, &s;hould
we now heartily &s;et about a War with <HI>Spain,</HI>
<HI>Spain</HI> giving the Occa&s;ion, it is no hard
matter to &s;hew how infinite Advantages
may be made of it in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
Capable to make full Reparation for all the
Damages our Trade can &s;uffer: But of that
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">
<HI>La&s;lty,</HI> Let it be ob&s;erv'd, that this Di&s;|cour&s;e
does not tend to an immediate De|claring
War again&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI>;
it takes it for granted, that Nece&s;&s;ity ob|liges
&s;ome Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> to joyn to pre|&s;erve
the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> and as has
been hinted to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to act again&s;t
tho&s;e that would break that Neutrality; if
this leads us to act again&s;t the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> it is not <HI>Britain,</HI> but the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> that leads us to it; and if in doing
this, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> takes if for a Breach
of the Peace, it is his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty that
begins the War, and not the King of <HI>Bri|tain,</HI>
and the Con&s;equences mu&s;t lye at
their Door, and not at ours.</P>
