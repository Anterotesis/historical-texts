<SPEAKER>Freeman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Country boy! ha, ha, ha! How long has this &s;cheme
been in your head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some time.&mdash; I am now convinced of what you have
often been hinting to me, that I am confoundedly cheated by
my &s;ervants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, are you &s;atisfied at la&s;t, Mr. Lovel? I always told
you, that there is not a wor&s;e &s;et of &s;ervants in the pari&s;h of
St. James's than in your kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis with &s;ome difficulty I believe it now, Mr. Free|man;
though, I mu&s;t own, my expences often make me
&s;tare.&mdash; Phillip, I am &s;ure&punc; is an hone&s;t fellow; and I will
&s;wear for my blacks&mdash; If there is a rogue among my folks, it
is that &s;urly dog Tom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mi&s;taken in every one. Phillip is an hypro|critical
ra&s;cal; Tom has a good deal of &s;urly hone&s;ty about
him; and for your blacks, they are as bad as your whites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Freeman, how came you to be &s;o well ac|quainted
with my people? None of the wenches are hand&s;ome
enough to move the affections of a middle-aged gentleman as
you are&mdash;ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a young man, Mr. Lovel, and take a pride
in a number of idle unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ervants, who are the plague
and reproach of this kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles you are an old-fa&s;hion'd fellow. Servants a
plague and reproach! ha, ha, ha! I would have forty more, if
my hou&s;e would hold them.&mdash;Why, man, in Jamaica, before I
was ten years old, I had a hundred blacks ki&s;&s;ing my feet eve|ry
day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gentry of the we&s;tern i&s;les are high-metled ones,
and love pomp and parade. I have &s;een it delight your &s;oul,
when the people in the &s;treet have &s;tared at your equipage;
e&s;pecially if they wi&s;pered loud enough to be heard, "That
is &s;quire Lovel, the great We&s;t-Indian"&mdash;ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry if we were &s;plenetic as you northern
i&s;landers, who are devoured with melancholy and fog&mdash;ha, ha,

the bounteous favour which our noble parent is plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow
on us.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h you had more of your noble parent's regularity,

</SP>

<P>But in that fifty we live two hundred, my dear; mark
that&mdash;But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I am re&s;olved upon my frolic&mdash;I
will know whether my &s;ervants are rogues or not. If they

for my impertinence. Pray tell me, is not your Robert ac|quainted
with my people? Perhaps he may give a little light
into the thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the truth, Mr. Lovel, your &s;ervants are
&s;o abandoned, that I have forbid him your hou&s;e. However,
if you have a mind to a&s;k him any que&s;tion, he &s;hall be forth|coming.</P>

<P>Let us have him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lov.</SPEAKER>
<P>My plan is this&mdash;I gave it out that I was going to my
