<LG>
<L>_MOST bounteous QUEEN, my grateful
Thanks I pay,</L>
<L>Which &s;carcely for the Dre&s;s of Words will
&s;tay:</L>
<L>Your ROYAL MAJESTY a Muck-worm took</L>
<L>From Labour, pleas'd with his mean trifling Book:</L>
<L>And now the Reptile at your Foot-&s;tool lays</L>
<L>In humble Strains, to &s;ing your worthy Prai&s;e.</L>
<L>The Wits prophane may court <HI>Urania</HI>'s Aid,</L>
<L>And make Addre&s;&s;es to a fictious Shade.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">
But I need no &s;uch Phantoms to in&s;pire;</L>
<L>Your Royal Bounty &s;ets my Soul on fire;</L>
<L>And what I lov'd before, I now admire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As on our Parents Labour was intail'd,</L>
<L>I work'd, and fallen State of Man bewail'd:</L>
<L>I pray'd for Ea&s;e, from Sorrow, Want and Pain,</L>
<L>And labour'd, my poor Offspring to maintain.</L>
<L>Without ambitious Thoughts, or Wi&s;hes vain,</L>
<L>I found my Ea&s;e in only Re&s;t from Pain;</L>
<L>And ble&s;s'd the Giver, when I thra&s;h'd the Grain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET Want &s;ometimes would &s;tare me in the Face,</L>
<L>And &s;carce my Labour wou'd &s;upply my Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Heav'n, in pity to my poor E&s;tate,</L>
<L>Brought me in Favour with the Wi&s;e and Great:</L>
<L>And heaping Bounty upon Bounty more,</L>
<L>Rais'd me to Plenty from a Thre&s;hing-floor.</L>
<L>Your Royal Goodne&s;s o're my Cottage &s;hone,</L>
<L>With brighter Beams, than did the ri&s;ing Sun:</L>
<L>And from a Barn Companion to the Mice,</L>
<L>Plac'd me at Ea&s;e, and in a Paradice.</L>
<L>Under great Heaven, my QUEEN I mu&s;t adore,</L>
<L>Who&s;e bounteous Soul no Captive needs implore.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Phoebus,</HI> in his Glory, all She &s;ees,</L>
<L>And ble&s;&s;es all in various Degrees.</L>
<L>May Heav'n pre&s;erve all who &s;urround her Throne,</L>
<L>And may her Line ne'er want a ROYAL SON.</L>

Now, as I've lei&s;ure Fancy to di&s;play,</L>
<L>My Pen &s;hall ever grateful Homage pay:</L>
<L>For &s;ure no Wretch can e're &s;o &s;tupid prove,</L>
<L>As to be blind to &s;uch abundant Love.</L>
<L>What am I&mdash;What I was&mdash;From whence I came,</L>
<L>Are Thoughts can't leave me long without a Theme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN e're I view the Grain in Barn or Field,</L>
<L>Or &s;ee a Farm that does GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing veild;</L>
<L>The Pro&s;pect will &s;uch Contemplation rai&s;e,</L>
<L>As mu&s;t begin in Joy, and end in Prai&s;e.</L>
<L>No Meadow green, or Stack or Cock of Hay,</L>
<L>But where I view will furni&s;h an E&s;&s;ay:</L>
<L>And then the Objects of my Prai&s;e will be,</L>
<L>The mighty Lord, and her great Maje&s;ty.</L>
<L>Our GOD, the Author of Benevolence,</L>
<L>Who does, by &s;econd Cau&s;es, Gifts di&s;pen&s;e;</L>
<L>In Goodne&s;s as in Greatne&s;s infinite,</L>
<L>His Children to good Actions does excite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE &s;aw her Maje&s;ty made up of Love,</L>
<L>And often heard her Orri&s;ons above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To know his Will, and knowing it to do</L>
<L>His Work, is all She aims at here below.</L>
<L>Th'Almighty &s;eeing &s;o much Chri&s;tian Grace,</L>
<L>And how, on Earth, &s;he ran the heavenly Race;</L>
<L>Has con&s;tituted ROYAL <HI>CAROLINE</HI></L>
<L>His Agent here, to make his Glory &s;hine.</L>

The Noble, Great and Powerful, humbly kneel;</L>
<L>Submi&s;&s;ive, full of Loyalty and Zeal:</L>
<L>And ask but to obey to all Commands,</L>
<L>Sign'd by &s;uch ju&s;t and mutal Royal Hands.</L>
<L>The poor anticipated have no more,</L>
<L>Than but to have it barely known they're Poor.</L>
<L>Nay, &s;ome have &s;trove their Poverty to hide,</L>
<L>Through Shame, or what &s;hould &s;hame, remaining Pride.</L>
<L>But &s;uch our Royal QUEEN in &s;ecret found,</L>
<L>And brought them out of Mire to ble&s;&s;ed Ground.</L>
<L>And this contriving and performing Good,</L>

<L>COULD Mortals ta&s;te of heavenly Bli&s;s and
Joy,</L>

<L>I, who have labour'd in a Thre&s;hing-floor,</L>
<L>Was once contented in my State, tho' poor:</L>
<L>Yet, like all Mortals, &s;till I pray'd for Ea&s;e,</L>
<L>But labour'd &s;till, like the indu&s;trious Bees;</L>
<L>Knowing the Winter comes, when Food is dear,</L>
<L>And Nature wants Supplies of whole&s;ome Cheer.</L>
<L>Ju&s;tly to think is Happine&s;s on Earth,</L>
<L>And cheerful Thoughts at Labour is &s;ound Mirth.</L>
<L>I, who have labour'd for a trifling Sum,</L>
<L>Was pleas'd, to think the time of Pay was come.</L>
<L>One Shilling goes for this, and one for that,</L>
<L>And &s;till the Flail went patt and patt a-patt.</L>

<L>Behold the Order of the Univer&s;e,</L>
