<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Clifford, accompanied by Julia, and Chartres, arrived in London &s;oon after Chri&s;tmas, where a &s;pacious and elegant hou&s;e, at the we&s;t end of the town, was prepared for their reception.</P>
<P>Frederick Seymour had taken a hou&s;e for him&s;elf in the neighbourhood, and he and Charlotte were &s;ettled in town a few days before Mr. Clifford arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
Julia, &s;ince the period of Seymour's marriage, had endeavoured, by every effort in her power, to bani&s;h his idea from her mind. She carefully avoided thinking of him, becau&s;e &s;he now felt her&s;elf inclined to pity, while &s;he blamed his unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ince he had fulfilled his engagements, at the price of peace, and had renounced all chance of happine&s;s, to comply with the de|mands of honor. But Julia was con|&s;cious, that though this conduct gave him &s;ome claim to her e&s;teem, e&s;teem was a &s;entiment which it was dangerous to cheri&s;h, and that, on this &s;ubject, re|flection was at cruel variance with re|po&s;e; &s;ince, whenever the idea of Sey|mour recurred to her mind, &s;he was imperceptibly led into a compari&s;on be|tween him and others; and the deci&s;ion which her heart involuntarily made, was by no means conducive to its tranquil|lity. But, though &s;he had not the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
merit of in&s;en&s;ibility, the purity of her mind corrected the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart. Rectitude &s;tood in the place of indiffe|rence; and, &s;ince &s;he could not entirely controul her feelings, &s;he di&s;regarded them altogether, and only &s;tudied, with a &s;ervent de&s;ire of acting right, to re|gulate her conduct by the &s;tricte&s;t pro|priety.</P>
<P>It was at her &s;olicitation that Mr. Clifford remained in the country till after Chri&s;tmas. He was impatient to &s;ee his daughter, but Julia always found &s;ome rea&s;on for delay, and pro|cra&s;tinated the journey to town, till no farther pretence could be urged, with|out incurring &s;u&s;picion. She attended him to town, prepared to act a part which &s;he felt would be difficult, but which &s;he &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;olved &s;hould be free from &s;elf-reproach.</P>
<P>The day before her departure from the country, &s;he vi&s;ited alone the an|cient
<PB N="4" REF="5">
chapel, where the remains of her father, and grandfather, were depo&s;ited. Here &s;he continued kneeling a con&s;ider|able time at the tomb, wrapt in medita|tion, and finding it every moment more difficult to tear her&s;elf from the &s;pot. At length &s;he aro&s;e, and, cla&s;ping her hands together, while &s;he continued gazing on the tomb, "Oh my father," &s;he cried, "thou can&s;t no longer guide and direct thy child, but may &s;he never forget thy precepts! And thou ever be|loved and venerable old man! who&s;e ho|nored image &s;till lives in my heart, oh, may thy &s;acred remembrance be the &s;ure&s;t guard of my conduct! If I am ever tempted to deviate from the path of rectitude, may I but think of thee, and &s;urely my heart will return to its duty: oh, never, never can I mediate on <HI>thee</HI> and per&s;evere in what is wrong!&mdash;Deare&s;t old man! though the grave hides thee from my view, the recollec|tion
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of thy goodne&s;s, thy &s;anctity, &s;hall be as a &s;hield to thy offspring; and may thy exemplary piety have entailed a ble&s;&s;ing on thy de&s;cendants! Oh, may I live&mdash;and may I die, like thee!"</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford, when near London, &s;ent a &s;ervant forward to inform his daughter of his coming. Frederick Seymour was not at home, but Char|lotte ha&s;tened to her father's hou&s;e, where &s;he had &s;oon the plea&s;ure of re|ceiving him. When their fir&s;t emo|tions at meeting had &s;ub&s;ided, Char|lotte intreated her father and Julia to go home with her, and &s;pend the day at her hou&s;e. They were preparing to &s;et out, in Charlotte's carriage, when Ju|lia's maid came into the room and beg|ged to &s;peak to her. Julia went out, and the maid &s;aid to her, "Indeed Ma'am, I could not help calling you out, for I went into the hall ju&s;t now to look after &s;ome of the boxes, and
<PB N="6" REF="7">
there's a poor old man &s;tanding at the foot of the &s;teps, that &s;ays, Ma'am, he knows you, and begged me, for the love of God, to &s;upplicate you to &s;ee him; and indeed, Ma'am, I had not the heart to refu&s;e the poor old creature, he look|ed &s;o pitiful."</P>
<P>Julia de&s;ired &s;he would tell him to come into the hall. The old man a&s;|cended the &s;teps with great difficulty, leaning on a &s;tick with one hand, and holding by the pali&s;ades with the other. His face was pale, and deeply furrowed with wrinkles, and his features, which were &s;trong, had a marked expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ettled &s;orrow. A con&s;iderable quantity of white hair, which was parted in the middle of his forehead, hung down his cheeks: his coat, which frequent patch|ing had rendered of many colours, did not appear dirty; and his linen was perfectly clean. His figure, though much bent by age and infirmity, &s;till
<PB N="7" REF="8">
retained &s;omething of a military air; and, though he tottered as he walked, his &s;tep was not that of a clown.</P>
<P>Julia recollected him in&s;tantly: he was an old &s;oldier, who had &s;erved in her grandfather's company, had fought the &s;ame battles, and &s;hared the &s;ame dangers. After nineteen years &s;ervice, he obtained his di&s;charge on account of ill health, but was not entitled to the benefit of Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital. His &s;on, however, who was a carpenter, main|tained him by his labour. Julia remem|bered, from her infancy, this old man, who u&s;ed to make frequent vi&s;its to her father's hou&s;e, where he was always re|ceived with kindne&s;s. She had often flown with eagerne&s;s, when a child, to announce his arrival to her grandfather, by whom &s;he had been early taught,
<Q><L>To pre&s;s the ba&s;hful &s;tranger to his food,</L>
<L>And learn the luxury of doing good!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
Julia was &s;hocked at &s;eeing the old man &s;o much altered, and emaciated. He told her, that his &s;on had died four months ago, of a fever, and that, &s;ince that period, he had &s;uffered extreme di&s;|tre&s;s. "I have been forced, Madam," &s;aid the old man, "to part with every bit of furniture that was in our room, to pay the rent, and keep body and &s;oul together. I have nothing left but the bed I lie on&mdash;but all won't do, Madam, and I mu&s;t go to the pari&s;h at la&s;t! Oh, wherefore," &s;aid the old man, bur&s;t|ing into tears, "wherefore is light given to him that is in mi&s;ery, and life unto the bitter in &s;oul; which look for death, but it cometh not, and &s;eek for it more than for hid trea&s;ures? But I heard, Madam, two days ago, that you would be here, &s;o I thought I would &s;ee you once more before I die. I knew you would have compa&s;&s;ion for me."</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed," &s;aid Julia, with ea|gerne&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
"my good old friend, you &s;hall never want while I can relieve you: think no more of going to the pari&s;h, we will provide for you."</P>
<P>The poor old man could not &s;peak, but he wept bitterly. Julia led him her&s;elf into a parlour. A porter, who had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting to carry in the bag|gage, and pa&s;&s;ed through the hall while &s;he was carefully leading the old man, with the tears &s;tanding in her eyes, &s;aid to one of the &s;ervants, "Aye, &s;he may die when &s;he likes, for (&s;wearing a ter|rible oath) &s;he's &s;ure enough of going to heaven." Julia ordered wine for the old man; and, when he was revived by it, left him, to tell her uncle what had pa&s;&s;ed. She returned with Mr. Clifford and Charlotte, who li&s;tened with the utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion to the old man, while he repeated his tale of &s;or|row, and dwelt on the virtues of his &s;on. When he had ea&s;ed his heart by this re|cital,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
he talked of his old ma&s;ter, and of Captain Clifford, fought over his pa&s;t battles, and lamented Captain Clifford's untimely death with a &s;im|plicity of hone&s;t &s;orrow, which drew tears from all his auditors. Julia was &s;o much affected, that her uncle and Charlotte hurried her away; but not till the old man had received a liberal do|nation, together with the a&s;&s;urance of a comfortable provi&s;ion for the remainder of his life. While he, putting his fee|ble hands together, implored that the "ble&s;&s;ing of him who was ready to pe|ri&s;h, might be upon them."</P>
<P>In the way to Frederick Seymour's hou&s;e, Julia dried her tears, and endea|voured to compo&s;e her mind, that &s;he might meet him with the calmne&s;s &s;he wi&s;hed; but the figure of the old &s;ol|dier pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her imagination, and the words he had uttered concern|ing her father re&s;ted upon her heart.
<PB N="11" REF="12">
She felt the deepe&s;t depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits; but when the carriage &s;topt at Sey|mour's door, and &s;he &s;aw him ha&s;tening through the hall to receive them, &s;he &s;ummoned all her &s;pirit, and a&s;&s;umed an appearance of &s;erenity. Seymour was far from being &s;o collected: his embarra&s;&s;ment was but too evident to Julia. He u&s;ed, again and again, the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure, and repeated the &s;ame enquiries, till he was at length checked by Chartres, who gravely declared, that the que&s;tion which Mr. Seymour then a&s;ked him, he had an&s;wered three times already. Had Charlotte been le&s;s un&s;u&s;pecting, or Mr. Clifford more penetrating, they could not have failed to ob&s;erve the &s;trange and di&s;tracted manner in which Seymour performed the honours of his table. When the &s;ervants had with|drawn, "Come," &s;aid Mr. Clifford, "my dear children, let us drink a
<PB N="12" REF="13">
bumper to the happine&s;s of our new-married pair. Julia, my love, come, fill your gla&s;s to the brim, and pledge me to your cou&s;in's happine&s;s!" Julia filled her gla&s;s, wi&s;hed Charlotte all happine&s;s, bowed to Seymour, and, after &s;wallowing a few drops, put down her gla&s;s. "Fie, Julia," &s;aid Mr. Clif|ford, "you ought to have emptied your gla&s;s to this toa&s;t." Julia changed colour, and again took up her gla&s;s. "Why, really, Julia," re&s;umed Mr. Clifford, "you drink <HI>my</HI> toa&s;t, as if it were a very &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s." "Indeed, my dear," &s;aid Charlotte, "you've per|formed your part with as much &s;ad &s;o|lemnity as if you had a pre&s;age that we were <HI>not</HI> to be happy." This remark, in Julia's pre&s;ent &s;tate of agitation, was more than &s;he could bear: her emo|tion was too great to be controuled, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. "My deare&s;t Charlotte," &s;aid &s;he, taking her cou|&s;in's
<PB N="13" REF="14">
hand, "be but as happy as <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h you, and you will be ble&s;t indeed." "My dear friend," &s;aid Charlotte, "I know all your affec|tion; but why indulge this &s;adne&s;s? I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hall find happine&s;s a very di&s;mal thing, unle&s;s you will con|&s;ent to be happy too." "This old &s;oldier has affected you," &s;aid Mr. Clifford; "but you mu&s;t not indulge low &s;pirits, my love; you mu&s;t be chear|ful for my &s;ake: you know you are my only child, now Charlotte has for|&s;aken me, and I can't live without you." "I am grateful," &s;aid Julia, in a broken voice, "indeed I am." Seymour, during this &s;cene, &s;at fixed like a &s;tatue: his eyes were riveted on Julia, his lips &s;ometimes moved, but he did not utter a word. Julia, reco|vering her&s;elf a little, ca&s;t a glance at Seymour, perceived his &s;ituation, and feared that Charlotte would ob&s;erve it.
<PB N="14" REF="15">
"Will you give me a gla&s;s of water, Mr. Seymour?" &s;aid &s;he, in order to rouze him from his &s;tupor. He &s;tarted as from a dream, and poured &s;ome wa|ter into a gla&s;s. "I am quite a&s;hamed of my&s;elf," &s;aid Julia: "few have &s;o much rea&s;on to be happy as I have; but the old &s;oldier has &s;unk my &s;pi|rits. However," added &s;he, with a &s;mile, "I promi&s;e never to behave &s;o ill again, and this once you mu&s;t all forgive me." Charlotte and Julia, &s;oon after, left the room.</P>
<P>When they were gone, Mr. Clifford filled his gla&s;s; "Come," &s;aid he, "Seymour, let us drink your cou&s;in's health." "With all my heart," &s;aid Seymour, filling his gla&s;s ha&s;tily. "Really," &s;aid Chartres, "Mi&s;s Clif|ford &s;eems va&s;tly ill: I never &s;aw her look &s;o pale," added he, turning to Seymour, "except the day <HI>you</HI> were married." "Yes&mdash;I recollect&mdash;I
<PB N="15" REF="16">
mean I remember&mdash;" replied Seymour, &s;peaking with difficulty, "&s;he was af|fected at parting with her friend." "I do not wonder &s;he is ill," &s;aid Mr. Clifford:" the old &s;oldier talked of my poor father and brother, till I could &s;carcely bear it my&s;elf." "But," re|joined Chartres, "Mi&s;s Clifford was certainly ill before the old &s;oldier ar|rived. I fancy the air of London di&s;|agrees with her, and &s;he &s;eemed to feel it at &s;ome miles di&s;tance; for I ob|&s;erved that, during the la&s;t &s;tage, her colour went and came every minute." Seymour li&s;tened in agony to the&s;e ob|&s;ervations, which, however, made no impre&s;&s;ion on Mr. Clifford; who, when Chartres had fini&s;hed his &s;peech, &s;aid, with warmth, that Julia was a charming creature, and that he loved her like his own child. "Indeed," added he, "&s;he is one of tho&s;e women whom it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love."
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Impo&s;&s;ible indeed! thought Seymour. "Her di&s;po&s;ition is very amiable," he replied. "So amiable," &s;aid Mr. Clifford, "and her per&s;on &s;o lovely, that I wonder any young man can &s;ee her with indifference." Ah, thought Seymour, who <HI>can</HI> &s;ee her with indif|ference! "She is a charming young woman," he rejoined. "I hope," &s;aid Mr. Clifford, "to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her happily &s;ettled this winter. Her countenance and figure, tacked to ten thou&s;and pounds, I think, bid fair for a good marriage; and, when &s;he is &s;ettled, I &s;hall have nothing to do but to die." Seymour li&s;tened to this ma|trimonial project with the feelings of a criminal who hears his own condemna|tion. His &s;oul recoiled at this plan of felicity; and he longed to per&s;uade Mr. Clifford that happine&s;s and ma|trimony had formed no in&s;epara|ble alliance, but, on the contrary,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
were often quite e&s;tranged from each other. He had, however, the prudence not to tru&s;t his feelings on this &s;ubject, and remained &s;ilent; while his unea&s;i|ne&s;s was entirely unob&s;erved by Mr. Clifford.</P>
<P>When Seymour reflected on what had pa&s;t, he was not much di&s;plea&s;ed at the recollection of the cau&s;e of Julia's emotion at dinner; nor was he con|cerned at the information that &s;he look|ed pale on the day of his marriage, and that her colour went and came during the la&s;t &s;tage. Such is the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, the incon&s;i&s;tency of pa&s;&s;ion, that Sey|mour, though he would chearfully have &s;acrificed his life to &s;ave Julia the &s;lighte&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, would yet willingly have excited in her mind tho&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions which overwhelmed his own with angui&s;h, and have been &s;oothed by ac|quiring an influence over her heart, which, he well knew, would never, in
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the &s;malle&s;t degree, affect her conduct; and which, indeed, his own principles of honor, and a re&s;pect for her cha|racter, which amounted almo&s;t to ido|latry, prevented him even from wi&s;hing it &s;hould. He might, therefore, have reflected, that any &s;en&s;ibility to his pa&s;|&s;ion, could only &s;erve to involve her in a degree of mi&s;ery, which was almo&s;t in&s;upportable to him&s;elf. But, the re|gion of pa&s;&s;ion is a land of de&s;poti&s;m, where rea&s;on exerci&s;es but a mock ju|ri&s;diction; and is continually forced to &s;ubmit to an arbitrary tyrant, who, re|jecting her fixed and temperate laws, is guided only by the dangerous im|pul&s;e of his own violent and uncon|troulable wi&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Charles Seymour lo&s;t not a moment in paying his re&s;pects to Julia, upon her arrival in town; ex|pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ure at &s;eeing her; expatiated on the encrea&s;ed bloom of her complexion; &s;poke in his lowe&s;t tone, and a&s;&s;umed his mo&s;t fini&s;hed mode of addre&s;s. Julia, at length, quite fa|tigued with &s;oftne&s;s, and oppre&s;&s;ed with panegyric, told him, "that &s;he was obliged to go out;" finding that, like mo&s;t other dull people, he was &s;ubject to the error of making long vi&s;its; and was, at pre&s;ent, too much engro&s;&s;ed by the care of acting his part gracefully, to remark her extreme wearine&s;s of his perform|ance.
<PB N="20" REF="21">
He intreated to have the honor of attending her where &s;he was going; and they walked to her milliner's, where caps and ribbons &s;eemed to &s;harpen his wit, and furni&s;h him with new modes of compliment; and where he waited with great re&s;ignation, while &s;he pur|cha&s;ed &s;everal articles of dre&s;s. No &s;et of people are &s;o patient as the intere&s;ted. They drudge on indefatigably in the &s;ame circle, and with one uniform pace, as quietly as a hor&s;e in a mill, contentedly expecting the end of their labours. Ju|lia could at la&s;t only get rid of Mr. Charles Seymour's attendance, by call|ing on Charlotte, at who&s;e door he took his leave; filled with &s;elf-complacency at the progre&s;s he was convinced he had that morning made in her favor; but at the &s;ame time recollecting, that the ex|traordinary trouble he was now obliged to take, was owing to his former entire ne|glect of the lady; and marking it, as
<PB N="21" REF="22">
one of his future maxims, that a young woman, who has a rich uncle in the Ea&s;t Indies, although &s;he has no fortune her|&s;elf, is to be treated with gallantry. In the mean time, he reconciled him&s;elf to his pa&s;t conduct, by reflecting, that there are &s;ome events, which no prudence can fore&s;ee; and &s;ome errors, which expe|rience only can correct.</P>
<P>Charlotte was going to call on Mr. Chartres's mother, where Julia accom|panied her. They were received with infinite delight by Chartres, who had returned to his mother's hou&s;e, where he found nothing that could atone for the lo&s;s of their &s;ociety: and Mrs. Char|tres was al&s;o glad to &s;ee them, not &s;ole|ly on account of their kindne&s;s to her &s;on, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e &s;he thought &s;o &s;plendid an equipage as Charlotte's, did honor to her door, and reflected &s;ome of the lu&s;tre of its &s;ilver trappings on her&s;elf. It is nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;ketch of this Lady's character.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">
Mrs. Chartres was one of tho&s;e per|&s;ons to whom time is a burden, which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cards, would be in&s;upportable. She con&s;idered whi&s;t as the fir&s;t end of exi&s;tence, and the &s;ole plea&s;ure of &s;ociety; for &s;he thought con|ver&s;ation the dulle&s;t occupation in the world; and, although &s;he knew there was &s;uch a term as friend&s;hip, her feel|ings did not convey much force to its meaning. Yet, &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible of &s;ome preference towards tho&s;e who gave her the be&s;t dinners. A pre&s;ent of a brace of woodcocks, of which &s;he was remarkably fond, would al&s;o &s;ecure her partial regard, and a young hare never failed to win her heart. With too little &s;en&s;ibility to feel her own deficiencies, and too little di&s;cernment to perceive when &s;he was treated with contempt, Mrs. Chartres could bear neglect with|out mortification, and deri&s;ion without re&s;entment. She was perfectly &s;atisfied
<PB N="23" REF="24">
with being admitted into company, as one who helped to make up the ne|ce&s;&s;ary number at a whi&s;t table, and to act a part, which an automaton, with a very little farther improvement in me|chani&s;m, could have performed as well. It was fortunate for Mrs. Chartres, that &s;he was not difficult in her choice of &s;ociety, or rigorous in her demands of attention and re&s;pect; for &s;he found &s;o|litude the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of all evils. Her mind re&s;embled an empty mirror, which has no character, no images of its own, borrows every impre&s;&s;ion from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ing object, and, if left to it&s;elf, would for ever remain vacant.</P>
<P>Mrs. Chartres delighted in new ac|quaintances; for, in proportion as &s;he was known, &s;he generally found people's civilities decline. But this never gave her any unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he con|trived, with great ea&s;e, to provide her|&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new vi&s;itors.
<PB N="24" REF="25">
She kept a pack of vi&s;iting tickets in her pocket-book, and, wherever &s;he went, di&s;tributed them liberally to any &s;tran|gers who were near her, or with whom &s;he happened to play at cards. By the&s;e means her acquaintance was numerous, though not very &s;elect; but &s;he compre|hended &s;o little the difference between one per&s;on and another, if they were equally well dre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he would only have been puzzled and perplexed by a greater power of choice.</P>
<P>Whenever Mrs. Chartres was di&s;en|gaged, &s;he was &s;ick, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in bed; but, when &s;he was fa&s;hionably dre&s;&s;ed, quite &s;ecure of a good dinner, and an evening party at cards, &s;he felt the charm of exi&s;tence, could think of the evils of her own lot with re&s;ignation, and of the evils of others with the mo&s;t perfect equanimity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Chartres had a habit of laughing whenever &s;he &s;poke. Having therefore laughed at a &s;torm of &s;now, been no
<PB N="25" REF="26">
le&s;s merry at the bad roads, and found her &s;on's awkwardne&s;s an equally good joke, &s;he told Charlotte and Julia, with a titter, that &s;he would &s;end them cards of invitation the next morning, to meet a party at her hou&s;e that day fortnight; adding, that &s;he was &s;ure they could yet have no engagements, as they were but ju&s;t come to town, and that they would for ever oblige her by coming. In vain the&s;e ladies a&s;&s;ured her, that they &s;hould prefer coming when &s;he had no other vi|&s;itors; and, that they liked conver&s;ation better than cards. Mrs. Chartres would no more <HI>hear</HI> a rea&s;on, than &s;he would have <HI>given</HI> one, "on compul&s;ion;" and, without paying the &s;malle&s;t attention to what they &s;aid, continued to urge her reque&s;t with &s;uch vehemence of entrea|ty, that, at length, they yielded to her importunity, and promi&s;ed to come.</P>
<P>As the morning was fine, Julia got out of the carriage at Charlotte's door,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
and walked home. In her way, &s;he &s;aw a young bird that was unable to fly, hop|ping on the pavement. A boy &s;eized it, whom &s;he bribed with a &s;hilling to re|linqui&s;h his prize, which &s;he was taking home, when it e&s;caped from her hand, and fell down the area of a hou&s;e. She de&s;ired the &s;ervant, who attended her, to knock at the door; and a &s;earch was made for the little fugitive, but it could no where be found. Julia wrote the following lines on this incident.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Honourable Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s waited on Julia a few days after her arrival in town; profu&s;e in profe&s;|&s;ions of regard, and eager to know if &s;he meant to give many concerts and balls, in the cour&s;e of the winter. Julia felt as much contempt for their pre&s;ent civilities, as for their former neglect; and received them with a degree of coldne&s;s, by which they found that a plan of tender and romantic friend&s;hip, intended to commence that very morn|ing, was not likely to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The&s;e ladies talked much to Julia of the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements, mingling, with great addre&s;s, in&s;truction with entertain|ment; and, while they informed her what
<PB N="31" REF="32">
every body of a certain fortune <HI>did,</HI> ob|liquely hinted what &s;he ought to <HI>do.</HI> Julia forced her&s;elf to hearken to their remarks; but, the moment the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s left the room, &s;he forgot their exi&s;tence; nor did &s;he recollect that there was any &s;uch thing as gaiety in the world&mdash;her whole thoughts being ab|&s;orbed by the ob&s;ervations &s;he had made on Frederick Seymour's behaviour &s;ince her arrival in town. She &s;aw him &s;trug|gling with ill-concealed wretchedne&s;s: &s;he bitterly reproached her&s;elf for her weakne&s;s on the fir&s;t day of their meet|ing; and endeavoured to atone for it, to her own mind, by avoiding all particular conver&s;ation with him mo&s;t carefully. She perceived that he now no longer ex|erted that re&s;olution which had formerly led him to &s;hun her &s;ociety; but that, on the contrary, he always attended his wife when &s;he vi&s;ited her father; and was always at home when Julia was expect|ed.
<PB N="32" REF="33">
He &s;eemed unable to refu&s;e him|&s;elf the indulgence of &s;eeing her; and when they parted, he was only occupied by the con&s;ideration when they &s;hould meet again; for he found that the charms of her conver&s;ation &s;oothed his unhappine&s;s, and that the tumult of his feelings was often calmed in her pre|&s;ence. His di&s;turbed mind re&s;embled a tempe&s;tuous flood, who&s;e waves ari&s;e dark and turbulent, except where the &s;un-beam throws a line of trembling radiance acro&s;s their agitated &s;urface.</P>
<P>When the evening arrived, on which Mrs. Chartres's card-a&s;&s;embly was to take place, Charlotte called upon Julia, and the two ladies went together. Mrs. Chartres's room could not hold four card-tables without &s;ome inconvenience to the company; but, unluckily, the point of her ambition was <HI>five.</HI> Her a&s;|piring mind preferred grandeur to ea&s;e. She felt a noble contempt of difficulties,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
when her aim was glory; and, as &s;he thought that five card-tables, filled with well-dre&s;&s;ed per&s;ons, was a very &s;ublime <HI>coup d'oeil,</HI> &s;he contrived to place them with &s;uch ma&s;terly arrangement, that not one inch of ground was lo&s;t. There was al&s;o a loo-table, in an adjoining room, or rather clo&s;et, round which the company had ju&s;t &s;ufficient &s;pace to &s;it, with their chairs clo&s;e to the wain&s;cot. One of the card-tables in the large room was &s;o near the door, that the candle placed next to it blew out every time the door was &s;hut or opened. Mrs. Chartres regretted that the wind was high: but then her five card-tables had a fine effect; "and it is &s;o ea&s;y," thought &s;he, "to light a candle, and be&s;ides, who knows but the wind may fall?"</P>
<P>Charlotte and Julia arrived before Mrs. Chartres had adju&s;ted all her card-tables, and gained admittance with
<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;ome difficulty. Mrs. Chartres pu&s;hed through the crowd to receive them; and, having a very &s;mall &s;pace to move in, by a &s;wing of her arms, which &s;he thought fa&s;hionable, &s;he overturned a candle|&s;tick which &s;tood on a card-table in her way, and &s;et fire to her gauze apron. Many &s;creams, and much confu&s;ion, en|&s;ued: but the flame was &s;oon happily extingui&s;hed; and, after lamenting for &s;ome time the depredations of fire on gauze aprons, &s;he left that fierce ele|ment to it&s;elf, and returned to the du|ties of the evening. She told Charlotte and Julia, "That &s;he would not a&s;k them to &s;it down till the card-tables were fixed, when they would obtain a good &s;eat." They &s;tood for a con&s;idera|ble time; but at length, (perceiving there was little chance of the ceremonies being adju&s;ted, and finding them&s;elves much incommoded by the &s;udden and frequent movements of Mrs. Chartres,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
and her &s;on, whom &s;he repeatedly order|ed to be alert, and who often met her in mid-way, and ran again&s;t her in all di|rections,) Charlotte and Julia procured a &s;eat for them&s;elves; and had lei&s;ure to contemplate the &s;cene before them. It &s;eemed as if the art of receiving com|pany con&s;i&s;ted in perpetual motion. Mrs. Chartres flew from one part of the room to the other, without intermi&s;&s;ion; enquired, in the hurry of her ta&s;k, if tho&s;e gue&s;ts were cold, who&s;e faces were &s;corched by being placed too clo&s;e to a large fire; and hoped Julia found the room warm, who was &s;eated with her back again&s;t a door, which was perpe|tually opening, while &s;he was almo&s;t frozen by a bla&s;t which i&s;&s;ued from it. Neither enquiry on the part of Mrs. Chartres, or complaint on that of Julia, could &s;erve any purpo&s;e. The company were packed for the evening, and no per&s;on could move without cau&s;ing a general di&s;turbance.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
One card-table was &s;till vacant, and the ta&s;k of making up another whi&s;t|party remained yet unperformed. The attack was begun on a Mrs. Sanford, who at fir&s;t ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to play; but at length, overcome by the &s;teady per&s;everance of Mrs. Chartres, &s;he gave her reluctant con&s;ent.</P>
<P>After lavi&s;hing much eloquence, Mrs. Chartres prevailed on three other per&s;ons to make up the party, who had before refu&s;ed to play. Some time was &s;pent in &s;ettling the price; and when this was done, Mrs. Sanford, who had retired to a corner of the room, was told the party waited for her. But Mrs. Sanford, who had by this time gained &s;ufficient fortitude to &s;u&s;tain another &s;iege, re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to play. The at|tack, however, was renewed with fre&s;h vigour, and poor Mrs. Sanford at la&s;t yielded to its violence. The party was &s;ettled, and Mrs. Chartres, relieved
<PB N="37" REF="38">
from this load of anxiety, found lei&s;ure for a little conver&s;ation with &s;uch of the company as would not be enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of the card-table; though &s;he felt much indignation at their refractory conduct. She now rejoiced that one lady had e&s;caped cold&mdash;hoped her neighbour on the right had e&s;caped too&mdash;and regret|ted that her on the left was &s;till hoar&s;e. Then &s;he enumerated all her own com|plaints&mdash;expatiated on her weak nerves&mdash;and afterwards, by a very ea&s;y tran&s;i|tion, pa&s;&s;ed from bodily to mental evils; lamenting that &s;he had had nothing but ill-luck the whole winter, and that &s;he had lo&s;t three crowns a night; and de|claring that her be&s;t fortune was never more than five &s;mall trumps, without one king or queen. Mrs. Chartres expected to awaken general &s;ympathy in her lo&s;&s;es; but &s;he forgot that there is more di&s;tre&s;s in the world than pity, and that the world cannot afford to wa&s;te any of its little
<PB N="38" REF="39">
&s;tock upon five &s;mall trumps. She then complained how much company had di&s;appointed her, and told Charlotte &s;he had received twenty apologies that morning. A little while after, &s;he related to another lady the &s;ame circum&s;tance, with the addition of ten more excu&s;es; and, when Frederick Seymour arrived, complained to him how ill her acquaint|ances had behaved; "For no le&s;s than forty cards of apology," &s;aid &s;he, "have I received this morning." "The men in buckram will &s;oon be here," &s;aid Charlotte. "I cannot help thinking," rejoined Seymour, in a low voice, "that the&s;e forty excu&s;es were well-timed; un|le&s;s Mrs. Chartres could adopt Milton's plan with the evil &s;pirits, and, by &s;ome commodious transformation, &s;uit the dimen&s;ions of her company to tho&s;e of her apartment."</P>
<P>Mrs. Chartres &s;oon after told Julia, in the confidence of friend&s;hip, that her
<PB N="39" REF="40">
old uncle was dead. "But I only re|ceived the account la&s;t night," &s;aid &s;he, "and it would have been &s;o much trouble to forbid all the company, that I thought I would let them come, and keep it a &s;ecret;&mdash;don't tell!"</P>
<P>Tea was brought by Thomas, a young countryman, who had enli&s;ted in one of the new-rai&s;ed regiments; but hav|ing been in a &s;hort time di&s;charged, be|cau&s;e his &s;ize was below the military &s;tandard, he had entered into the &s;er|vice of Mrs. Chartres. His figure was &s;quat; his &s;houlders broad and high; and his livery &s;omewhat old-fa&s;hioned, with a profu&s;ion of buttons, and long wai&s;tcoat pockets; and, upon the whole, he bore a very &s;triking re&s;emblance to Mr. Par|&s;ons, in the entertainment of High Life above Stairs. It was ea&s;y to perceive that Thomas had been accu&s;tomed to march by beat of drum; and though, in the exerci&s;e of his pre&s;ent peaceable pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
he wore no defiance in his a&s;|pect, but, on the contrary, hung down his head, and looked meek as a lamb, yet his military &s;tep &s;till rendered him for|midable. He pre&s;ented the tea-cups in the &s;ame abrupt manner in which he had been taught to pre&s;ent his firelock; and, Julia being unprepared for the&s;e martial movements, a cup of tea was &s;pilt on her gown. Thomas's face be|came like &s;carlet at this accident. Mrs. Chartres &s;colded loudly, and declared &s;he believed it would be impo&s;&s;ible to cure him of his awkward ways. "Then," &s;aid &s;he, "he blunders for ever; I never knew him once do right; he brings me into &s;uch &s;crapes!&mdash;I or|dered him, a month ago, to leave two tickets at Mrs. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, and Mrs. N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, which he thought proper to forget; and now Mrs. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> is gone to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and Mrs. N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> is dead:&mdash;how provoking! Mrs. Char|tres's
<PB N="41" REF="42">
di&s;cour&s;e did not proceed without interruption; for, whenever a knock was heard at the &s;treet-door, &s;he in&s;tantly &s;tarted from her &s;eat, obliged the com|pany to make way, and &s;tationed her|&s;elf at the door of the apartment, where &s;he paid her compliments to her vi&s;itors, before &s;he &s;uffered them to pa&s;s the thre|&s;hold; and where, for the mo&s;t part, &s;he &s;tood a con&s;iderable time in expec|tation; Thomas being &s;o unwilling to leave the company above, to admit tho&s;e who were waiting in their car|riages below, that his mi&s;tre&s;s was, more than once, compelled to remind him of his duty by a pu&s;h on the &s;houlder.</P>
<P>The rubber being now fini&s;hed, at the table where Mrs. Sanford had been compelled to &s;it down, &s;he came to Mrs. Chartres, to know who was to cut in. "I know of nobody," &s;aid Mrs. Chartres, with great compo&s;ure, "you mu&s;t play on." At this moment, Fre|derick
<PB N="42" REF="43">
Seymour, who had been called away, returned, fortunately for Mrs. Sanford, who in&s;tantly quitted the ta|ble. Seymour had little inclination to play. He however came prepared to do penance; and, being convinced, like other votaries of mortification, that his merit would be great, in proportion as his &s;en&s;ations were di&s;agreeable, he quietly &s;eated him&s;elf at whi&s;t.</P>
<P>A young man now entered the room foppi&s;hly dre&s;&s;ed; and, ca&s;ting a look of &s;elf-importance around the company, he advanced with a &s;auntering &s;tep to Mrs. Chartres, and apologized for his &s;i&s;ter's not coming, who, he &s;aid, was detained by two friends, that had ju&s;t arrived from the country. "La," &s;aid Mrs. Chartres, "I wi&s;h &s;he had come, and brought her two friends with her, they would have helped to fill up the room." "You are very good Ma'am," replied Mr. Burton; "upon my word we never
<PB N="43" REF="44">
thought of that." He then turned to &s;peak to an acquaintance, and Mrs. Chartres took that opportunity of in|forming Julia, that &s;he had a&s;ked Mr. Burton on purpo&s;e to meet her; for, "I know," &s;aid &s;he, "you are a great read|er; &s;o I thought you would like him; for, I do a&s;&s;ure you, he's va&s;tly clever, and knows all about Cicero, and Hume's Hi&s;tory of England." By this time the connoi&s;&s;eur in Cicero, having fini&s;hed his compliments, returned to Mrs. Chartres's circle, and, placing him&s;elf next to Julia, a&s;ked her if &s;he had &s;een the new play?" She &s;aid &s;he had not. "I'm &s;urprized at that Ma'am," rejoin|ed Mr. Burton, "I a&s;&s;ure you every body likes it." "Well, I really long to go," &s;aid Mrs. Chartres, with her u&s;ual laugh; "but Mrs. Smith has been &s;o much engaged, that &s;he could not take me, and I have no notion of going to the play in a hack, and coming into
<PB N="44" REF="45">
the boxes with the &s;traw about one's petticoats, as if one had ju&s;t e&s;caped from Bedlam. To be &s;ure, I might have gone a fortnight ago to the new play, but they would only give us a &s;econd row, and, at the other hou&s;e, they gave us a fir&s;t; &s;o I thought the difference of the play didn't &s;ignify much." "And pray what was the play you &s;aw, Ma'am?" enquired Mr. Burton. "Mac|beth," replied Mrs. Chartres: "I de|clare I was quite di&s;appointed, for I had never &s;een it before, and I had a notion Lady Macbeth was a good &s;ort of woman; and there is &s;uch wickedne&s;s going on, and &s;o many extravagant fancies!" Mrs. Chartres concluded, as &s;he had begun, with a laugh, and then made her way to another part of the room.</P>
<P>Meantime Mr. Burton intreated Ju|lia to join the party at loo, declaring that he was &s;ure &s;he would win, and he
<PB N="45" REF="46">
would bet any &s;um upon her cards. When he found &s;he was inflexible in her determination not to play, he endea|voured to entertain her, while he di&s;|played his own knowledge of fa&s;hion|able life, by talking of the public places, particularly the theatre; and by di&s;cu&s;&s;ing at large the merits of the dif|ferent actors and actre&s;&s;es; only inter|rupting his critici&s;m to give her a &s;ig|nificant wink at the manner in which Thomas pre&s;ented the lemonade. Ju|lia, quite di&s;gu&s;ted with his vulgar and impertinent familiarity, ro&s;e to change her &s;eat, which was a matter of &s;ome difficulty. Placing her&s;elf near three young ladies, who were dre&s;&s;ed in the utmo&s;t extreme of the fa&s;hion, &s;he en|deavoured to avoid Mr. Burton's a&s;&s;i|duity, who followed her with officious gallantry, by entering into conver&s;ation with the&s;e ladies; but &s;he found her&s;elf wholly unqualified for the ta&s;k. Their
<PB N="46" REF="47">
conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ted entirely of anec|dotes of the nobility, and minute details of all that had lately pa&s;t in the great world. In vain, however, did the&s;e ladies attempt to dazzle and awe each other, by the rank and importance of their re&s;pec|tive friends; for, if one mentioned an in|cident, which had happened to her friend, Lady &s;uch a one, the other young la|dies immediately recollected &s;ome cir|cum&s;tance, as well worth relating, of a friend of equal rank.</P>
<P>Frederick Seymour now left the card|table, where he had been &s;colded, the whole time he played, by his partner, a little fat woman, above forty, with a pert countenance, and a manner &s;till more pert than her phy&s;iognomy, who kept her&s;elf in pocket-money by cards, and was eagle-eyed to the &s;malle&s;t devia|tion from what &s;he thought the rules of the game. She and Seymour gained the fir&s;t rubber. One of their opponents
<PB N="47" REF="48">
happened to have no &s;ilver, and, while &s;he was trying to get change, the other laid down a crown to Seymour, which his partner in&s;tantly &s;natched up, &s;aying that the other lady &s;hould pay Mr. Sey|mour, for &s;he her&s;elf was &s;o apt to forget! After cutting for partners, &s;he was again Seymour's lot; and they &s;oon lo&s;t double the &s;um they had gained. When Seymour left the table, Mrs. Chartres enquiring if he had won, he &s;aid, "he had no &s;ubject of &s;atisfac|tion, but the &s;ucce&s;s of others." His di&s;agreeable partner now joined their circle, affected to talk of her ill|luck with indifference, and began &s;ym|pathizing with Mrs. Chartres, who again brought forward her own bad for|tune. "I ob&s;erve," &s;aid Seymour to Julia, "that people are at as much pains to di&s;play their feelings, on occa&s;ions when they feel nothing, as to hide them at cards, when they are lo&s;ing their mo|ney,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
and really feel a great deal." Mrs. Chartres watched her opportunity, and, while &s;he fancied her&s;elf unob&s;erved, could not re&s;i&s;t moving towards the card-table which Seymour had quit|ted, and gently lifting the candle&s;tick, to &s;ee if the card-money had been duly remembered. Being &s;atisfied of this, &s;he came up to Julia, and complained of her not calling upon her in a morning. "I &s;eldom pay morning vi&s;its," &s;aid Julia. "Oh, I know you're always reading," &s;aid Mrs. Chartres; "I &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hut your&s;elf up at home: aren't you charm'd with the Pangs of Sen&s;ibility?" "Is that the title of a book?" &s;aid Ju|lia. "La, why, is it po&s;&s;ible you haven't read the new novel, the Pangs of Sen&s;ibility?" "No indeed I have not," an&s;wered Julia, "Well, I'm &s;o &s;ur|prized! Nor you, Mrs. Seymour, not read the Pangs of Sen&s;ibility?" "No." "Nor have you never heard of it,
<PB N="49" REF="50">
Mr. Seymour?" "I mu&s;t acknow|ledge my ignorance of the book," &s;aid Seymour, "whatever imputation it may be upon my ta&s;te." "Oh, pray do buy it," re&s;umed Mrs. Chartres; "it will only co&s;t you &s;ix &s;hillings, and its &s;o exce&s;&s;ively pretty; but the end's very di&s;mal." "Well," &s;aid Seymour, "I &s;hall be prepared for the wor&s;t; and you may depend upon it we will have &s;ix &s;hillings-worth of &s;en&s;ibility to-mo|row morning."</P>
<P>Thomas now announced Mrs. Sey|mour's carriage, not by coming for|ward, and telling her the agreeable tidings in a low voice, as is u&s;ual; but, having collected all his courage in com|ing up &s;tairs, he opened the door, and, with a firm countenance, called out, as loud as he could, Mrs. Seymour's car|riage <HI>ready!</HI> which la&s;t word he pro|nounced &s;o &s;hort and quick, and in &s;uch an elevated tone, that it had the effect
<PB N="50" REF="51">
of an electrical &s;hock, and no per&s;on of weak nerves could hear it without &s;tarting. Charlotte ro&s;e in&s;tantly, and was ha&s;tening away with great alacrity; but &s;he found this a more difficult en|terprize than &s;he imagined. Mrs. Chartres &s;eized both her hands, de|clared &s;he mu&s;t not go &s;o &s;oon, a&s;&s;ured her it was very early a hundred times in a breath, and, gathering fre&s;h cou|rage as &s;he proceeded, at length, in a mo&s;t authoritative tone, in&s;i&s;ted upon her &s;taying. Although unprepared for &s;o violent an attack, Charlotte, when &s;he had recovered her &s;urprize, a&s;&s;igned a rea&s;on for going, which &s;he thought unan&s;werable: &s;he told Mrs. Chartres, "that &s;he made it a rule not to keep her &s;ervants and hor&s;es in waiting in bad weather." "La," &s;aid Mrs. Char|tres, "why, your &s;ervants can come into the hou&s;e, and as for the hor&s;es, you told me two of your's were &s;ick,

and you had job hor&s;es; &s;o why need you care about their waiting, &s;ince they are not your own?" Charlotte an|&s;wered, "that, indeed, <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on had never occurred to her; but though the hor&s;es are <HI>not</HI> my own," &s;aid &s;he, with &s;ome empha&s;is, "I mu&s;t be gone this moment:" and &s;he was again ha&s;tening away, when Mrs. Chartres &s;uddenly placed her&s;elf between her and the door; declared that &s;he had prepared a &s;upper below for a &s;mall &s;elect party; expatiated on the cruelty of refu&s;ing to &s;tay this once, when her &s;upper was prepared; and then petitioned, im|plored, and per&s;ecuted, till &s;he wrung from the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Charlotte her &s;low con&s;ent to &s;end away the carriage for an hour.</P>
<P>The cho&s;en party which Mrs. Char|tres di&s;tingui&s;hed by an invitation to &s;upper, waited a con&s;iderable time after the re&s;t of the company were di&s;per&s;ed,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
before the repa&s;t was announced. Mrs. Chartres had not proportioned the num|ber of her gue&s;ts to the &s;ize of her ta|ble, which was &s;o crouded, that the company were obliged to &s;it &s;ideways, and, whenever a plate was changed, or a di&s;h removed, to give way by general con&s;ent. But the&s;e inconveniences Mrs. Chartres perceived with perfect indif|ference, and only lamented, that &s;he could not prevail on more of her friends to &s;tay. She heard, with equal com|po&s;ure, the vain applications which were made to Thomas for plates, knives, and forks. Thomas, when cal|led upon, an&s;wered, "Yes," with great alertne&s;s; but, as nothing can come of nothing, it was entirely out of his power to &s;upply the demands of the company. All that wi&s;dom could &s;ugge&s;t, or promptitude atchieve, Thomas per|formed. When de&s;ired to bring de|&s;ert &s;poons, of which there were none
<PB N="53" REF="54">
in the hou&s;e, he pre&s;ented tea-&s;poons; and when called upon for oil (an arti|cle which, in the hurry of preparation, had been forgotten) he produced vine|gar, by way of &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>Mr. Burton had taken care to place him&s;elf next Julia, to whom he devoted his whole attention, and begged to have the honour of helping her to &s;ome chicken, enquiring what part &s;he cho&s;e. She de&s;ired a wing. "Well, I declare," &s;aid Mr. Burton, "that &s;urprizes me; I think a leg &s;o much better. I believe I have a &s;trange ta&s;te; but I like the legs of all fowls better than the wings; I even prefer the drum&s;tick of a tur|key." Julia made him no an&s;wer, as it was a point &s;he felt not the lea&s;t incli|nation to di&s;cu&s;s. After &s;upper there was much loud merriment; for the company in general &s;eemed to be of opinion, that mirth and noi&s;e were &s;y|nonymous terms, and gaiety merely a
<PB N="54" REF="55">
counterfeit, unle&s;s it was powerful enough to di&s;turb the neighbourhood. When the party became a little fa|tigued with this vociferous convivia|lity, Mr. Burton, in order, as he de|clared, "to keep it up," volunteered a &s;ong in the Italian manner; but in a voice that &s;corned all tune, and with &s;o many &s;trange cadences, that Char|lotte, who was in good &s;pirits, found it extremely difficult to avoid laugh|ing. Mr. Burton, however, was &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied with his own per|formance, that, when the &s;ong was fini&s;hed, he looked round to collect the applau&s;e of his audience. He then propo&s;ed &s;entimental toa&s;ts, which, he &s;aid, he liked of all things, among cle|ver people: but Charlotte's carriage was now announced, who, impatient to be gone, ha&s;tened away with too quick a pace to be again &s;topped. Julia followed as fa&s;t as &s;he could, happy to
<PB N="55" REF="56">
leave the ladies who were in friend&s;hip with the nobility, and e&s;corted to the carriage by the gentleman who knew &s;o much about Cicero, and had &s;uch a ta&s;te for the drum&s;ticks of turkies. Frederick Seymour ha&s;tened after the ladies; but they could &s;carcely be con|vinced they had e&s;caped, till they were out of the hou&s;e; for Mrs. Chartres pur&s;ued them along the pa&s;&s;age, with repeated wi&s;hes that they might not get cold, repeated thanks for their com|pany, and a thou&s;and "good-nights," till they were quite out of hearing.</P>
<P>In their way home, Charlotte laugh|ed heartily at the recollection of all that had pa&s;&s;ed; while Julia declared, &s;he thought the evening the longe&s;t &s;he had ever &s;pent. Seymour expre&s;&s;ed his in|dignation at the horrible penance he had undergone; and all of them agreed never to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice of time again.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
Mrs. Chartres, on the contrary, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed her gue&s;ts with much &s;elf-com|placency. She had given a card-a&s;&s;em|bly, and a <HI>petit-&s;ouper</HI>; and had not &s;ufficient penetration to di&s;cern that her &s;ketch of elegance was a wretched daub; and, though it was copied from what &s;he had heard of high-life, had as little re&s;emblance to its model, as the picture of King William on a &s;ign-po&s;t, to the real features of the hero it repre&s;ents. When the company departed, Mrs. Chartres told her &s;on, with an air of triumph, that the evening had <HI>gone off</HI> remarkably well. Chartres was by no means of opinion that the evening had gone off <HI>well:</HI> but that it was gone at la&s;t, was to him a mo&s;t comfortable re|flection; to whom it had produced no|thing but confu&s;ion, per&s;piration, and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Melbourne, and Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, who had been &s;ome weeks at Bath, arrived in town; and &s;oon after Mrs. Melbourne took an opportunity to repeat, what &s;he had already more than once in&s;inuated to Mr. Clifford, that Julia was incapable of the management of his family, and that he ought to watch her narrowly, and limit her expences. It may &s;eem &s;trange, that Mrs. Melbourne took the trouble to intere&s;t her&s;elf in Mr. Clif|ford's family affairs: but &s;he had no le&s;s than two motives for this conduct. Since Julia was the age of &s;eventeen, this lady had had a &s;tanding quarrel
<PB N="58" REF="59">
with her, on account of her beauty; and, though &s;he had patched up a reconcili|ation on Mrs. Seymour's marriage, her former animo&s;ity revived, when &s;he &s;aw Julia mi&s;tre&s;s of her uncle's hou&s;e, and living in greater &s;plendor than her own daughter. But, independently of this parental jealou&s;y, Mrs. Melbourne was a per&s;on who often intermeddled in the concerns of other people, merely as an exerci&s;e for the activity of her own mind. She had the highe&s;t opinion of her own penetration, was fond of com|mand, wi&s;hed to be the directing &s;tar of all her acquaintances, and di&s;tributed coun&s;el, admonition, and reproof, with infinite liberality. There is, however, a remarkable difference in the value placed upon advice, by tho&s;e who give, and tho&s;e who receive it; and Mrs. Melbourne's tutelar care of Mr. Clif|ford's hou&s;ehold, met with &s;o cold a re|ception from that gentleman, that &s;he
<PB N="59" REF="60">
determined to deprive him of the bene|fit of her in&s;tructions in future.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seymour &s;oon invited Julia to a party at her hou&s;e, where her chief amu&s;ement aro&s;e from the ob&s;ervations &s;he made on Charles Seymour's beha|viour. She could gue&s;s the rank or fortune of the per&s;ons with whom he conver&s;ed, with as much preci&s;ion as if &s;he had read their names in the Court Calendar, or had learnt from their bro|ker the &s;tate of their funds: for, had the title, or wealth, of each of his acquaint|ances been weighed in one &s;cale, and the degree of his attention in another, the counterpoi&s;e would have been found exactly even, without one grain of courte&s;y, one atom of kindne&s;s being wa&s;ted, or mi&s;placed. If the rule of his conduct had been &s;omewhat more no|ble, nothing could have been more prai&s;e-worthy than his diligent adher|ence to it; which was uniform, and un|deviating;
<PB N="60" REF="61">
neither relaxed by tender|ne&s;s, or moved by admiration. Polite|ne&s;s, in him, was the offspring, not of benevolence, but of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and though he laboured to conceal its here|ditary likene&s;s, under the ma&s;k of o&s;ten|tatious urbanity, and &s;tudied candor, yet &s;ome lurking meanne&s;s, or in&s;olent neglect, occa&s;ionally betrayed, to per|&s;ons of penetration, its ignoble origin.</P>
<P>He devoted half an hour, in the cour&s;e of the evening, to Julia; which was certainly half an hour lo&s;t, both to her and to him&s;elf; though he was gay and tender, witty and pathetic, by turns; muttered, &s;ighed, and &s;miled, and re|peated tho&s;e flattering things, to which he was well convinced no woman could li&s;ten with indifference, when they pro|ceeded from his lips. When he thought Julia had heard enough to be almo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly in love with the &s;peaker, to prevent that mi&s;chief, he &s;auntered to
<PB N="61" REF="62">
the younge&s;t Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who was &s;it|ting at &s;ome di&s;tance with a very grave countenance; but, when &s;he &s;aw him approaching, her features became more gay every &s;tep he advanced, and &s;he was &s;o &s;prightly by the time he drew near, that &s;he received him with an encou|raging titter, which &s;he honoured his wit by renewing at proper intervals.</P>
<P>Meantime, Frederick Seymour, whol|ly ab&s;orbed by Julia, played at whi&s;t without knowing a card in his hand, and followed her with his eye wherever &s;he moved. He &s;aw her conver&s;ing with Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">; ob&s;erved that &s;he &s;eemed to have plea&s;ure in the conver&s;ation; and that &s;he &s;miled upon him with great &s;weetne&s;s: and, while he meditated with horror on the &s;atisfaction expre&s;&s;ed in her countenance, he fini&s;hed the rubber very expeditiou&s;ly, by making &s;ome ca|pital mi&s;takes. He paid his lo&s;&s;es with great alacrity, and ha&s;tened to Mr.
<PB N="62" REF="63">
F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, whom he engaged in conver&s;a|tion; but he had no power to detain Julia, and &s;he left her &s;eat in a few mi|nutes. Seymour did not dare to follow; and, while he was employed in watching her movements, entirely forgot that he was conver&s;ing with Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, till that gentleman left him and ha&s;tened to the party of ladies whom Julia had join|ed. Frederick Seymour now perceived, that in quitting the whi&s;t-table, he had only procured for him&s;elf a change of mi&s;ery: again Mr. F. &s;poke, and again Julia li&s;tened. In vain Seymour en|deavoured to witne&s;s this &s;econd con|ver&s;ation-&s;cene with compo&s;ure;&mdash;in vain he &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s his &s;en&s;a|tions;&mdash;it was a thing impo&s;&s;ible! "Ah! who can hold a fire in his hand, by thinking of the fro&s;ty Cauca&s;us?" Seymour, in a fit of de&s;pair, went to Charlotte, told her he was going to pay a vi&s;it, and ha&s;tened away. But, by the
<PB N="63" REF="64">
time he reached the &s;treet door, he hear|tily repented having left the room. He fancied he &s;aw Julia rejoicing in his ab|&s;ence; and Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> happy in her &s;miles. He wi&s;hed to find &s;ome excu&s;e for returning: but the pre&s;ent agitation of his mind was not favourable to in|vention; and he was at la&s;t reduced to hope, that his hor&s;es feet might &s;lip, his carriage break down, and that &s;ome kind di&s;a&s;ter might furni&s;h him with a pretence to go back. But while the&s;e things were pa&s;&s;ing in his mind, his coachman conducted him in perfect fafety to his own door. He ha&s;tened to his &s;tudy, but with no intention to read; walked up and down the room, then flung him&s;elf into a chair; then walked again; li&s;tened to every carriage that pa&s;&s;ed; thought Charlotte would never return; reflected how much time Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had had for conver&s;ation; and was little comforted when Charlotte appeared,
<PB N="64" REF="65">
and told him &s;he had left her father and Julia behind, as his carriage was not come. Seymour was &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Clifford cho&s;e to &s;tay &s;o late, wondered Charlotte did not offer to &s;et him down, and de&s;ired to know what company &s;he left behind. Charlotte mentioned &s;eve|ral names, but omitted Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and Seymour was obliged to a&s;k if he was gone when &s;he came away? "Oh, no," &s;aid Charlotte, "I beg Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s pardon, I declare I quite forgot him, and I wonder at that, for I left him talking to Julia." Seymour ro&s;e ha&s;tily from his &s;eat, and walked two or three times acro&s;s the room. He then en|quired at what hour Mrs. Seymour's parties generally broke up; and gained no information. Meantime Charlotte grew &s;omewhat tired of her hu&s;band's interrogatories: "Yet," thought &s;he, "it is ea&s;y to repeat a few names, and an&s;wer a few que&s;tions; and though
<PB N="65" REF="66">
I find them a little dull, becau&s;e I am &s;leepy, I am glad he is amu&s;ed."</P>
<P>At length, however, when Seymour again renewed the &s;ubject of Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, "Do, my dear Mr. Seymour," &s;aid Charlotte, "let me bid that worthy gentleman good night; and we'll have him &s;erved up at breakfa&s;t to-morrow morning." Charlotte went to &s;leep, as uncon&s;cious of the pain &s;he had inflict|ed, by her intelligence re&s;pecting Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, as a child who &s;ports with ima|ges of death, and prattles about the tall feathers of the hear&s;e, to the afflicted mourner, who feels every &s;yllable a wound.</P>
<P>Julia, though &s;he had conver&s;ed with Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> with apparent cheerfulne&s;s, felt no &s;uch &s;en&s;ation at her heart. She had perceived Frederick Seymour's jea|lou&s;y and perturbation, and trembled le&s;t his unhappy pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be di&s;|covered, and &s;pread a wider circle of
<PB N="66" REF="67">
mi&s;ery. She found &s;ome relief, after he was gone, in conver&s;ing with Mr. Sey|mour, who &s;aw &s;he was in bad &s;pirits, and exerted his brilliant talents for her entertainment. He had a high place in her e&s;teem. She re&s;pected his abilities, was charmed with his conver&s;ation, and &s;ometimes &s;ecretly lamented, that he was not united to a woman more capa|ble of conferring dome&s;tic happine&s;s. But an incident happened, which total|ly altered her opinion of his character.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford hired a hou&s;ekeeper, on the recommendation of an old friend of his, to whom &s;he had been long known. This per&s;on had only been a few days in Mr. Clifford's family, when &s;he acknowledged to Julia, that &s;he had lived many years with Mr. Seymour's mother, and that &s;he had only left Mr. Seymour's &s;ervice one year. Julia enquired into the rea&s;on of her quitting it. "Ah, Ma'am," &s;aid &s;he, "it
<PB N="67" REF="68">
was becau&s;e I was too hone&s;t, and loved that poor dear young lady, Mrs. Mey|nell, too well." "Who is Mrs. Mey|nell?" enquired Julia. "Have you never heard of her, Ma'am?" "No, never." She then related to Julia, that Mrs. Meynell's mother, who was the daughter of a Scotch Lord, married her father's chaplain, a Mr. Forbes. Her fa|mily renounced her; and her brother, who &s;oon after &s;ucceeded to the title, would never hear her name. Her hu&s;|band died &s;ome years after their mar|riage, and Mrs. Forbes was &s;o much afflicted at his death, that &s;he fell into a con&s;umption, and &s;oon followed him to the grave; leaving one daughter. Several years before Mrs. Forbes's marriage, her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter had married Mr. Seymour, an Engli&s;h gentleman, who was the father of the pre&s;ent Mr. Seymour. Upon the death of Mrs. Forbes, Mrs. Seymour, who was then
<PB N="68" REF="69">
a widow, took her orphan child under her own protection. "She was ju&s;t &s;e|ven years old, Ma'am," &s;aid the hou&s;e-keeper to Julia, "when &s;he came to my mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he had &s;o many en|gaging ways, Ma'am, that &s;he &s;oon won all our hearts. Pretty creature! &s;he would &s;it and talk of her poor mama, by the hour together. "To be &s;ure, (&s;he would &s;ay) my aunt is very good to me, but I &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs. Evans, an aunt never loves one like a mama." "My dear," &s;ays I, "your aunt will be a mama to you now." "Yes," &s;ays &s;he, "my aunt &s;aid &s;o ye&s;terday, and told me I might call her mama, if I plea&s;ed, and &s;o I &s;hall: but for all that, &s;he's not my own true mama that was put into the coffin." "Poor little &s;oul! I remem|ber very well going into the room one day, and the child was &s;tanding at the window, crying: &s;o, &s;ays I, What are you crying for, my dear? &s;ays I."
<PB N="69" REF="70">
"Nothing, Mrs. Evans, only," (and &s;he &s;obbed,) "only that black coach, that went by, put me in mind of my mama; I was thinking how &s;he ki&s;&s;ed me, the la&s;t time, before &s;he died; and I remember every word mama &s;aid. She took me in her arms, and held me <HI>&s;o</HI> fa&s;t! and &s;aid, My poor child!&mdash;my &s;weet darling!&mdash;mu&s;t I leave you?&mdash;God Almighty ble&s;s you, my poor or|phan! and then &s;he &s;aid &s;omething more about the fatherle&s;s&mdash;and then my ma|ma <HI>cried</HI> &s;o, Mrs. Evans!&mdash;and I cried very much indeed.&mdash;Pray, Mrs. Evans, what made my mama call me poor child? I'm not <HI>poor,</HI> you know; I have frocks enough, and a new black &s;a&s;h; and yet every body that comes to &s;ee my aunt ki&s;&s;es me, and &s;ays, Poor little thing! But <HI>I</HI> can gue&s;s why they call <HI>me poor</HI>; it's becau&s;e I have no mama, and other little girls have a papa and mama too." "I could not
<PB N="70" REF="71">
bear to hear her innocent prattle, Ma'am, it went to my very heart. "Heavens ble&s;s you, my love," &s;aid I, "and keep you from all evil!" "And pray, Mrs. Evans," &s;aid &s;he, "what is evil?" "I wi&s;h you may never know," &s;aid I. "But come, my dear," &s;ays I, "come into my room, and I'll give you a great peach." "No, I thank you, Mrs. Evans," &s;ays &s;he, "keep it for me till to-morrow, if you plea&s;e; I &s;hall like the peach be&s;t when I'm not thinking of my mama."</P>
<P>"Well, Ma'am, &s;he grew up, as one may &s;ay, like a fine plant, tall, and &s;traight, and a very lovely creature &s;he is: &s;he has &s;omething, Ma'am, of your mild look. And &s;o, Ma'am, as I was &s;aying, my mi&s;tre&s;s could not help being fond of her, and gave her fine cloaths, and took her every where a vi&s;iting with her."</P>
<P>Mrs. Evans then informed Julia,
<PB N="71" REF="72">
that at the death of Mrs. Seymour, which happened when Mi&s;s Forbes was two and twenty, &s;he was left entirely de&s;titute; as Mrs. Seymour had no|thing but her jointure, and it was not in her power to provide for her niece. The young lady, upon her aunt's death, determined to go out in the world, how|ever unfit &s;he felt her&s;elf to &s;truggle with its difficulties. But this mea&s;ure Mr. Seymour &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, in|forming her, that he was going to be married, in a few months, to Mi&s;s Mel|bourne, and intreating that &s;he would &s;till con&s;ider his hou&s;e as her home. He a&s;&s;ured her of his utmo&s;t endeavours to make her &s;ituation happy; and propo&s;|ed that, till his marriage took place, &s;he &s;hould board with a family of which he had &s;ome knowledge.</P>
<P>"So, Ma'am," continued Mrs. Evans, "&s;he hardly knew what to do. So,
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Ma'am, I advi&s;ed her to go, till &s;he could look about her: &s;o &s;he went, and, as &s;oon as ever Mr. Seymour was married, he invited her to his hou&s;e; but &s;he &s;aid to me, the night &s;he came, "&s;ays &s;he, Mrs. Evans," &s;ays &s;he, "I am come here for a few weeks, becau&s;e Mr. Sey|mour urged it with &s;o much kindne&s;s that I could not well refu&s;e. But I am determined not to live in a &s;tate of de|pendance, and &s;hall only &s;tay till I can provide my&s;elf with a proper &s;ituation." "Well, Ma'am, Mrs. Seymour was pro|digious civil to her at fir&s;t; but &s;he &s;oon behaved &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful, and &s;o &s;piteful, you can't think. I believe in my con|&s;cience it was all <HI>pure</HI> envy, becau&s;e Mi&s;s Forbes was hand&s;omer than her|&s;elf; for, Ma'am, Mi&s;s Forbes looks like a queen when &s;he's dre&s;&s;ed: Mrs. Sey|mour isn't fit to hold the candle to her. So, poor thing, &s;he u&s;ed to complain, Ma'am, of ill health, and never would
<PB N="73" REF="74">
appear when there was company, or go out with Mrs. Seymour; &s;o Mrs. Sey|mour kept it a &s;ecret &s;he was in the hou&s;e." "And where is &s;he now?" &s;aid Julia, with eagerne&s;s. "Why you &s;hall hear, Ma'am. She was re&s;olved to go out in the world, but &s;he couldn't hear of a &s;ituation directly; &s;o Mr. Sey|mour told her &s;he would make him mi&s;erable if &s;he thought of it; but, if &s;he di&s;liked his family, &s;he &s;hould go and board where &s;he was before; &s;o, Ma'am, &s;he went, till &s;he could hear of a place. Well, Ma'am, then he came every day to vi&s;it her, on pretence, to be &s;ure, that &s;he was his cou&s;in; but at la&s;t, Ma'am, he had the a&s;&s;urance to make downright love to her. So &s;he &s;ent for me, all of a hurry, and cried bitterly, and told me of it; for, Ma'am, though I &s;hould not &s;ay it my&s;elf, I had always done my du|ty by her, and &s;he knew how I loved her, and &s;o &s;he treated me like a friend. So, Ma'am, there was a captain on half|pay,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
a Captain Meynell, that vi&s;ited where &s;he was, and had made propo&s;als of marriage to her; and, it was &s;aid, he had a good deal of money in the &s;tocks; and &s;o the be&s;t advice I could give her was, to take him for better for wor&s;e, though, to be &s;ure, he was a little rough, and ugly enough, God knows. Well, Ma'am, &s;he was half di&s;tracted, and at la&s;t &s;he con&s;ented to marry the Captain, in de&s;pair, as one may &s;ay. So, Ma'am, Mr. Seymour gave me leave to go and dre&s;s her wedding dinner, and be with her; and plague enough I had with their awkward &s;ervants, to be &s;ure. There was a pretty di&s;h of green pea&s;e overboiled, that co&s;t Mr. Seymour a gui|nea; for he &s;ent them, though &s;he wou'dn't &s;ee him, and a very hand&s;ome di&s;h it was, to give the devil his due. There was a very good dinner to be &s;ure, for the mat|ter of that; I remember all the di&s;hes. I'm &s;ure I had vexation enough: the
<PB N="75" REF="76">
ducklings were over-roa&s;ted, and that &s;weet creature cried &s;o; many a &s;alt tear I &s;hed with her. I was &s;o vexed about the ducklings, I never met with &s;uch an accident before; and many a pair have I &s;ent up in my time, roa&s;ted to a turn; but then I had all my things proper about me. Moreover, Ma'am," &s;ays I, "what does it argufy," &s;ays I, "taking on &s;o now, when the deed's done; but, poor &s;oul! &s;he only cried the more for that. She was dre&s;&s;ed all in white, Ma'am, and as plain as could be, but &s;he looked charmingly for all that. Well, Ma'am, &s;he wanted to go directly and live in the country, to hide her&s;elf from the world, as &s;he called it; but do you know, Ma'am, that mon&s;ter my ma&s;ter (for a mon&s;ter he is to be &s;ure) per&s;uaded her hu&s;band, who is but thick-headed, to &s;tay in London, and he would get him &s;ome place or another; but all he wanted was to keep
<PB N="76" REF="77">
her here for his own vile ends. And now, Ma'am, he's always going there, on pretence of &s;eeing Captain Meynell; but &s;he takes on &s;o, I believe &s;he'll fret her&s;elf to death &s;oon." "Where does &s;he live?" &s;aid Julia; "Why, Ma'am, in a little mi&s;erable &s;ort of a lodging in Charles-&s;treet, We&s;t|min&s;ter. I'm &s;ure I little thought for to &s;ee her come to that; and, I believe, &s;he often goes without her dinner: for it turned out, that Captain Meynell had no money at all, and only married her in hopes that her great friends would provide for him; and, I believe, Ma'am, Mr. Seymour knew well enough he was poor when &s;he married him; but he wanted to get her more into his own clutches. Well, Ma'am, and Mrs. Seymour goes &s;ometimes to &s;ee her, but its only to vaunt over her. Oh, Ma'am, it &s;ets my blood up &s;o when I think of it. So one day I gave
<PB N="77" REF="78">
it to Mr. Seymour pretty roundly, for all his doings; and told him a piece of my mind. And "Sir," &s;ays I, "I &s;hould expect a cur&s;e, Sir," &s;ays I, "would come upon me, if I eat your bread any longer; and I de&s;ired to be paid my wages, and went off that very night." Julia was now called away, but Mrs. Evans's narrative had made a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on her mind. She determined to get acquainted with Mrs. Meynell, and felt a generous impatience to foften her misfortunes, by admini&s;tering all the comfort which her unhappy &s;ituation would admit. With re&s;pect to Mr. Seymour, &s;he felt that &s;evere di&s;ap|pointment which is experienced by an ardent and ingenuous mind, when it is forced to exchange the fervent glow of e&s;teem and confidence, for di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion; and when, finding it&s;elf gro&s;s|ly deceived in its opinions of another, it is led with painful regret to lower its general &s;tandard of human excellence.
<PB N="78" REF="79">
She lamented that Mr. Seymour's character, which appeared open, libe|ral, and elevated, &s;hould &s;o ill bear a clo&s;e in&s;pection; and that his mind re|&s;embled one of tho&s;e pictures which mu&s;t be viewed by the dim light of a taper; &s;ince their coar&s;e and glaring co|lours, which attract the eye in the de|ceitful medium, &s;hrink from the full and clear &s;un&s;hine of truth.</P>
<P>But, while Julia's heart throbbed with indignation at the oppre&s;&s;or, and melted with compa&s;&s;ion for the oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw the arm of indignant Hea|ven tearing the veil by which iniquity was concealed, and making manife&s;t the &s;ufferings of innocence. And, while &s;he hoped to act as the agent of Provi|dence, in protecting afflicted virtue, &s;he exulted in the &s;trengthened conviction, that evil, like a baleful meteor, has its appointed cour&s;e, and then mu&s;t &s;et in darkne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<P>JULIA felt all the eagerne&s;s of ar|dent benevolence to become ac|quainted with Mrs. Meynell, and to en|deavour, by every effort in her power, to alleviate her misfortunes. She de|termined to wait upon her immediate|ly, but had too much re&s;pect for her unhappy &s;ituation to vi&s;it her without the cu&s;tomary forms of introduction.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tened to Charlotte, impatient to be informed if &s;he had any knowledge of Mrs. Meynell, and anxious to &s;olve a mo&s;t painful doubt which aro&s;e in her mind, left Frederick Seymour &s;hould be capable of de&s;erting his amiable rela|tion becau&s;e &s;he was unfortunate. A doubt of tho&s;e in who&s;e integrity we
<PB N="80" REF="81">
have confided, in who&s;e virtue we are intere&s;ted, is a &s;ituation of mind the mo&s;t gloomy and comfortle&s;s. Su&s;|picion is like a mi&s;t, which renders the object it &s;hades &s;o uncertain, that the figure mu&s;t be fini&s;hed by imagination; and, when di&s;tru&s;t takes the pencil, the &s;trokes are generally &s;o dark, that the di&s;appointed heart &s;ickens at the pic|ture.</P>
<P>Julia related to Charlotte the cir|cum&s;tances which Mrs. Evans had told her concerning Mrs. Meynell, conceal|ing, however, her account of Mr. Sey|mour's criminal de&s;igns, which &s;he thought it was improper to communi|cate to any one. Charlotte told her, that &s;he had frequently heard Frederick Seymour &s;peak of Mrs. Meynell with the mo&s;t affectionate concern. "We have &s;carcely had a moment's <HI>t&eacute;te-&agrave;|t&eacute;te,</HI>" &s;aid Charlotte, "&s;ince you came to town, or I &s;hould certainly have
<PB N="81" REF="82">
mentioned to you what I had heard of her. Mr. Seymour has often told me how much he was &s;hocked, at his re|turn from the continent, to find her married to &s;uch a man as Captain Meynell; and he has vi&s;ited her three or four times &s;ince we came to town, but &s;he will not allow him to bring me to wait upon her. He &s;ays, he is &s;ure that Mrs. Seymour has been in&s;olent to her, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he ap|prehends the &s;ame treatment from me: I cannot intrude upon her again&s;t her con&s;ent, but I hope &s;he will be per|&s;uaded to &s;ee me in time." "But, my dear Charlotte," rejoined Julia, "we will not wait the&s;e &s;low determinations. She has not forbidden <HI>me</HI> to come, and I will go directly to Mrs. Seymour, ob|lige her to introduce me to Mrs. Mey|nell, and then bring you together at my uncle's." Julia, earne&s;t in her pro|ject, without farther deliberation, called
<PB N="82" REF="83">
upon Mrs. Seymour, and enquired if &s;he had an hour of lei&s;ure that morn|ing. Mrs. Seymour a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he was quite di&s;engaged, and va&s;tly happy to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Since the period of Mr. Clifford's re|turn from the Ea&s;t, Mrs. Seymour had behaved to Julia with the utmo&s;t cordi|ality, as &s;he now thought her acquaint|ance eligible; though &s;he could feel no friend&s;hip for a woman &s;o hand&s;ome: for Mrs. Seymour was not like the world in general, attracted by "a &s;et of features, or the tincture of a &s;kin;" but, on the contrary, felt a generous affec|tion for deformity. She was &s;en&s;ible, however, that her ta&s;te was &s;ingular, and &s;he therefore concealed it carefully. After many expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s on the part of Mrs. Seymour, and &s;ome general conver&s;ation, Julia led to the &s;ubject of her vi&s;it, by mentioning that Mrs. Evans was now Mr. Clifford's
<PB N="83" REF="84">
hou&s;ekeeper. Mrs. Seymour changed colour at this intelligence: "That's &s;trange enough," &s;aid &s;he; "pray, who recommended her?"&mdash;"An old friend of Mr. Clifford's."&mdash;"Well, I am &s;ure," added Mrs. Seymour, with affected carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, "you will not keep her long. She is a mo&s;t forward imperti|nent creature, and had been &s;o &s;poilt by Mr. Seymour's mother, that I found my&s;elf obliged to part with her." "There is <HI>one</HI> circum&s;tance, however," &s;aid Julia, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at Mrs. Seymour, "which gives me a favour|able opinion of her; her &s;trong at|tachment to Mrs. Meynell." "O yes," replied Mrs. Seymour, in mani|fe&s;t confu&s;ion, "&s;he's a poor relation of Mr. Seymour's." "I wonder I never heard you mention her name," rejoined Julia. "Why, really," &s;aid Mrs. Sey|mour, "I thought it very unnece&s;&s;ary to teaze you with a long hi&s;tory of Mr.
<PB N="84" REF="85">
Seymour's relations." "But I think Mrs. Meynell's &s;tory &s;o intere&s;ting, and the accounts I have heard of her from Evans have prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me &s;o &s;trongly in her favour, that I feel a great de&s;ire for her acquaintance; and the purpo&s;e of my vi&s;it, this morning, is to a&s;k you to come with me, and introduce me to her." "Ble&s;s me, my dear Mi&s;s Clif|ford," &s;aid Mrs. Seymour, with apparent chagrin, "what a &s;trange whim!&mdash;what in the world can you have to do with Mrs. Meynell?" "I have no other rea&s;on," &s;aid Julia, calmly, "for de&s;iring her ac|quaintance, than that her character and &s;ituation intere&s;t me. But come, why &s;hould we wa&s;te time in talking of our vi&s;it? Mr. Clifford's carriage is at the door: I &s;uppo&s;e you often call on Mrs. Meynell, and there will be nothing very &s;ingular in taking me with you." "Oh, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Seymour, "you don't know what confu&s;ion the &s;ight of
<PB N="85" REF="86">
a new carriage will create. It will &s;hake Mrs. Meynell's nerves for a fortnight; &s;he'll be flying into her bed-room to tie on a clean apron, and come to us in &s;uch a tremble!" "<HI>That</HI> will give me pain indeed," &s;aid Julia. "I a&s;&s;ure you," rejoined Mrs. Seymour, "going there is the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thing in the world. I was made &s;o ill la&s;t time I went, by an unlucky circum&s;tance.&mdash;You mu&s;t know &s;he lodges at a taylor's, and the men work in the garret: &s;o the la&s;t time I called, her little girl of a &s;ervant was out of the way, and a &s;our ill-looking fellow opened the door, and, when my &s;ervant enquired if Mrs. Mey|nell was at home, an&s;wered "Yes," and walked away. So I got out of the car|riage and was going up &s;tairs, for I knew it was in vain to wait for any body to announce me; and ju&s;t as I reached the fir&s;t landing-place, I met five or &s;ix men coming with a &s;hocking noi&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="87">
down &s;tairs. It really &s;truck me that they were a gang of thieves, who had plundered the hou&s;e, and were making off. I believe I gave a &s;ort of &s;cream, but they &s;topped, and made way for me very re&s;pectfully; and, who &s;hould the&s;e people be but the men who work in the garret, coming down to dinner. However, when I reached Mrs. Mey|nell, I was &s;o ill with the fright, that I was forced to call for a gla&s;s of water. I waited a great while for it, for &s;he was obliged to get it her&s;elf, and when I told her the rea&s;on of my being in|di&s;po&s;ed, &s;he was &s;o &s;ullen that &s;he would &s;carcely &s;peak while I &s;tayed. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he very good-naturedly thought there was &s;omething of affecta|tion in my fright. Becau&s;e &s;he is u&s;ed to this formidable troop her&s;elf, &s;he fan|cied that there was nothing in it to alarm <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Julia, "I am not at
<PB N="87" REF="88">
all deterred, by your rencounter, from wi&s;hing to vi&s;it Mrs. Meynell; and feel more di&s;po&s;ed to pity than blame her &s;ullenne&s;s on the occa&s;ion you men|tion." "If you <HI>will</HI> go," &s;aid Mrs. Seymour, with &s;ome a&s;perity, "you <HI>mu&s;t</HI>; and if you find the acquaintance trouble&s;ome, remember its your own fault." She then rung the bell for her maid, ordered, with much ill-humour, her cloak and gloves, and &s;et off with Julia in Mr. Clifford's carriage. Mrs. Seymour was extremely &s;ullen the whole way; and, when Julia &s;poke to her, only an&s;wered by mono&s;yllables, till they drew near the door; when &s;he ad|vi&s;ed Julia to take care to hold up her gown while &s;he went up &s;tairs, or &s;he would probably have her train toler|ably dirtied from the feet of the work|men.</P>
<P>Julia found, that though Mrs. Mey|nell's lodgings were mean, and &s;uch as
<PB N="88" REF="89">
be&s;poke extreme penury, the dirt and confu&s;ion, of which Mrs. Seymour com|plained, were violently exaggerated; but, notwith&s;tanding this, the habitation appeared utterly unfit for the inhabit|ant. She &s;eemed like a finely propor|tioned &s;tatue; the exqui&s;ite workman|&s;hip of Grecian hands, which tho&s;e ma&s;ters of art would have deemed wor|thy to inhabit a temple, and decorate a &s;hrine; but which Gothic barbarity had placed in a rude and &s;ordid hut, where it lay neglected, by tho&s;e who were ig|norant of its value. Mrs. Meynell was about twenty-four years of age; her fi|gure was tall, graceful, and elegant; her countenance, with a con&s;iderable degree of beauty, had a &s;trong expre&s;|&s;ion of melancholy; and there was a dignity in her manner which command|ed re&s;pect, even from tho&s;e who were unfeeling enough to refu&s;e it to her &s;itu|ation. She had heard much of Julia's
<PB N="89" REF="90">
goodne&s;s from the old hou&s;ekeeper, who had been to vi&s;it her &s;ince her re|&s;idence in Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e; and, though Mrs. Meynell was unable to account for Julia's vi&s;it, &s;he was charm|ed with the &s;weetne&s;s of her manner, and conver&s;ed with her with evident plea&s;ure. When Mrs. Seymour ro&s;e to take leave, Julia gave Mrs. Meynell a card with her direction, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee her, in a manner which &s;hewed how much &s;he wi&s;hed it. Mrs. Mey|nell promi&s;ed to wait upon her, and the ladies departed.</P>
<P>Captain Meynell did not appear dur|ing their vi&s;it; but we will give a &s;hort &s;ketch of his character. He was about the middle &s;ize, thin, and rather genteel in his figure; but his manners were di&s;gu&s;ting, and his per&s;on u&s;ually dirty. His mind was a &s;trange compound of pride and meanne&s;s. He was continu+ally boa&s;ting of his wife's family, and
<PB N="90" REF="91">
was not a little proud of his own, which was al&s;o re&s;pectable, but which he him|&s;elf di&s;graced. He behaved with the mo&s;t abject meanne&s;s, to all tho&s;e who he thought could &s;erve him; yet, at times, when he fancied him&s;elf neglect|ed or ill u&s;ed, his brutality &s;uddenly bur&s;t forth, and by a reproof, which had more of rudene&s;s than &s;atire, he defeat|ed the &s;ervile practices of years, and was generally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with di&s;grace. His &s;ullenne&s;s, which was extreme, no|thing could conquer, but his in&s;atiable curio&s;ity, which led him to make the mo&s;t minute enquiries into the private hi&s;tory of his acquaintances. Such anecdotes he retailed with the greate&s;t avidity, and often occa&s;ioned much mi&s;|chief by &s;o doing. He had as &s;trong an affection for Mrs. Meynell as he was capable of feeling. He had married her merely with a view to &s;ecure Mr. Sey|mour's good offices, who had been la|vi&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="92">
in his promi&s;es of &s;ervice, being earne&s;t, from the wor&s;t motives, to pro|mote this ill-a&s;&s;orted union. But though Captain Meynell had no views in mar|rying, but tho&s;e of intere&s;t, his wife's &s;weetne&s;s of temper, exemplary re&s;igna|tion, and uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, had awakened every &s;park of tenderne&s;s in his bo&s;om, and led him to feel a &s;in|cere wi&s;h to make her happy: yet, his &s;ordid meanne&s;s, vulgarity, and ill-hu|mour, continually fru&s;trated that de|&s;ire. His ferocious nature was &s;oftened, but not &s;ubdued; and his varying hu|mours only produced, to his unhappy wife, "variety of wretchedne&s;s." She was either wearied with his mirth, di&s;|gu&s;ted by his fondne&s;s, &s;hocked by his meanne&s;s, or wounded by his bruta|lity.</P>
<P>In her way from Mrs. Meynell's, Julia expre&s;&s;ed, in the warme&s;t terms, her admiration of that lady; to who&s;e
<PB N="92" REF="93">
prai&s;es Mrs. Seymour reluctantly a&s;|&s;ented. Julia returned home, exulting in plans of future benevolence. She found Mr. Clifford at home, and Fre|derick Seymour with him. She told them, that Mrs. Seymour had intro|duced her to Mrs. Meynell, and de|clared how much &s;he was plea&s;ed with that lady's conver&s;ation and manners. While they were conver&s;ing on this &s;ub|ject, Mr. Clifford was called out of the room; and Frederick Seymour, who had li&s;tened to the hi&s;tory of her vi&s;it, with delighted attention, exclaimed with warmth, "I am not ignorant, Mi&s;s Clifford, of the generous motives which have prompted you to make this vi&s;it; for I have ju&s;t had a conference with my old friend Mrs. Evans, who told me &s;he had made you acquainted with Mrs. Meynell's misfortunes." "She is in|finitely to be pitied," replied Julia. "But &s;he will henceforth be le&s;s unhap|py,"
<PB N="93" REF="94">
rejoined Seymour, "for &s;he will po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>your</HI> &s;ympathy, &s;he will be ble&s;&s;|ed with <HI>your</HI> friend&s;hip, and the evils, which are &s;oothed by &s;uch con&s;olation, are more to be envied than deplored." "It is later than I imagined," &s;aid Julia, looking at her watch, "I mu&s;t go and dre&s;s for dinner." "Ah Mi&s;s Clifford," re&s;umed he pa&s;&s;ionately, "mu&s;t then the indulgence of conver&s;ing with you for a moment, be for ever denied me? What have I &s;aid, of what have I been guilty, to merit this &s;everity?&mdash;Alas, Madam, far from daring to utter a &s;en|timent unfit for you to hear, I have been lamenting the mi&s;eries of another, at the very moment when the acute &s;en&s;ation of my own wretchedne&s;s al|mo&s;t deadens every feeling of &s;ympa|thy: in vain I have &s;truggled to &s;ub|due that ob&s;tinate wretchedne&s;s"&mdash;"Why, Sir," &s;aid Julia, interrupt|ing him, "will you force me to fly from you, by u&s;ing a language, which
<PB N="94" REF="95">
I cannot hear without indignation?" While &s;he was ha&s;tening out of the room, he exclaimed, "But one mo|ment!" "No Sir, not a moment." She then left him, and when &s;he reached her own apartment, forgot her inten|tion to dre&s;s, and only thought of that look of de&s;pondency, with which Sey|mour &s;aw her depart. Soon, however, rouzing her&s;elf from this dangerous meditation, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed, and ha&s;tened into company, determined to allow her|&s;elf not a moment more for the indul|gence of reflection, which &s;he was con|&s;cious, in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind, was but another name for the indulgence of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Seymour remained, for &s;ome time af|ter Julia had left the room, in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery not to be de&s;cribed. Pa&s;&s;ionately as he loved her, he had no de&s;ire but that of &s;eeing, of conver&s;ing with her, of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a place in her e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. He had the highe&s;t re&s;pect
<PB N="95" REF="96">
for her character, nor ever &s;uffered him|&s;elf to harbour a wi&s;h incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity of her heart, and the recti|tude of her principles. He was, there|fore, filled with remor&s;e and angui&s;h, when he reflected that, by the weak indulgence of complaints in her pre|&s;ence, he had ju&s;tly incurred her re|&s;entment; and, perhaps, by wounding her delicacy, robbed him&s;elf of that &s;hare of her pity and regard, which was the &s;ole alleviation of his mi&s;ery. He left Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e in the utmo&s;t perturbation of mind, and returned home di&s;con&s;olate and wretched. Sey|mour, in vain, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, and was placed in a &s;ituation which opened a &s;plendid and honour|able career for his abilities. Ab&s;orbed by his unfortunate feelings, tho&s;e ta|lents were u&s;ele&s;s, and tho&s;e advantages were lo&s;t. His mind re&s;embled a fine|toned in&s;trument, who&s;e exten&s;ive com|pa&s;s
<PB N="96" REF="97">
was capable of producing the mo&s;t &s;ublime and elevating &s;ounds; but a fatal pre&s;&s;ure relaxed the &s;trings, and &s;unk its powerful harmony.</P>
<P>The ardent, enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of this young man was &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions. How carefully, therefore, &s;hould he have guarded again&s;t the weak indulgence of that imperious pa&s;&s;ion, which, on &s;uch a temper, produces the mo&s;t fatal ef|fects, and &s;ubdues all energy of &s;oul! In vain would that &s;park of divinity within us, pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of ambi|tion, the ardor of enterprize, the re|&s;earches of knowledge, or the contem|plations of philo&s;ophy. Tho&s;e noble, tho&s;e exalted privileges of our nature, become a painful exerci&s;e to faculties which are chained to one idea, and to a heart which flutters round one object, and can as little change that object as the magnetic needle its direction; which,

<P>MRS. Meynell wi&s;hed much to return Julia's vi&s;it, but was for &s;everal days prevented by the bad|ne&s;s of the weather; and her finances did not admit of the expence of a hackney-coach. For Captain Meynell, who was to the la&s;t degree mean and par&s;imonious in his di&s;po&s;ition, denied her even the little indulgences his nar|row income could afford; &s;eldom al|lowed her to have a &s;hilling in her pocket; and when he did, it was on the &s;ame condition upon which the vicar of Wakefield be&s;towed a guinea upon his daughters; viz. with a &s;trict in|junction not to change it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t fair day, however, Mrs.
<PB N="99" REF="100">
Meynell, in &s;pite of dirty &s;treets, &s;et out for Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e, which was in Berkley-&s;quare. She picked her way, with difficulty, through the dirt, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t her cloaths &s;hould be &s;pla&s;hed, which, &s;he knew, would pre|vent her gaining admittance; the &s;er|vants in wealthy families being, in ge|neral, very nice ob&s;ervers of etiquette, and proportioning their civilities, with great preci&s;ion, to the dre&s;s and appear|ance of the vi&s;itor. In cro&s;&s;ing over Piccadilly, Mrs. Meynell was &s;topped by a carriage, and, looking up, &s;aw Mrs. Seymour, with her mother and Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, in the carriage. The ladies bowed to her &s;omewhat &s;uperciliou&s;ly as they pa&s;&s;ed, and Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> looked after her till &s;he could &s;ee her no longer. Mrs. Meynell conjectured that they were going to Mr. Clifford's, and, mor|tified at the thoughts of meeting them, and fatigued and di&s;pirited by her toil|&s;ome
<PB N="100" REF="101">
walk, &s;he felt a &s;trong inclination to return home immediately: but, re|collecting that &s;he might, very proba|bly, have the &s;ame di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances to encounter another time, &s;he determined to proceed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seymour and her party were, as Mrs. Meynell apprehended, going to Mr. Clifford's, where they were admitted. After the u&s;ual com|pliments, Mrs. Seymour enquired of Julia, if Mrs. Meynell had returned her vi&s;it? Julia an&s;wered that &s;he had not. "Oh, then &s;he will be here pre|&s;ently," rejoined Mrs. Seymour, "for we have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed her in Piccadilly." "I'm &s;ure," &s;aid Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, "Mrs. Meynell takes a great deal of trouble to wait on you, Mi&s;s Clifford, for we met her wading through the dirt, poor woman." "I &s;hall place a particular value on her vi&s;it," replied Julia, "if that will be any compen&s;ation for her

di&s;agreeable walk." "She is certainly very much to be pitied," &s;aid Mrs. Sey|mour, in a pathetic tone; "I'm &s;ure my feelings have been deeply wounded by her &s;ituation. I mu&s;t own I'm very &s;orry &s;he's coming here this morning, and I almo&s;t wi&s;h you would be denied to her; my &s;pirits are already &s;o low, about my poor little dog. I'm afraid I &s;hall lo&s;e him, after all my nur&s;ing: he &s;eemed quite well ye&s;terday, but this morning he has had a relap&s;e." Ju|lia, without once lamenting that Bijoux was &s;ubject to relap&s;es, coolly &s;aid, that "&s;he could not think of refu&s;ing ad|mittance to Mrs. Meynell, as &s;he was very de&s;irous to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her." "I believe &s;he's a de&s;erv|ing young woman," &s;aid Mrs. Mel|bourne, and I &s;hould a&s;k her oftener than I do to dine with me, (for I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aving a dinner at home is &s;ome object in her circum&s;tances,) but her melancholy looks are as di&s;a|greeable
<PB N="102" REF="103">
as the face of a creditor to a man in debt; a &s;ort of demand upon one's pity, that's very trouble&s;ome. Her clothes too are grown &s;o &s;habby, that I can only a&s;k her when I'm alone, and really my &s;pirits are too weak to bear &s;uch a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> frequently." "One cannot much wonder," replied Julia, "that a woman of Mrs. Mey|nell's &s;en&s;ibility is unhappy, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as her's." "For my part," re|joined Mrs. Melbourne, "I cannot un|der&s;tand what right people have to the indulgence of &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, who are in poverty. People in affluence may indulge the delicacy of their feelings; and mine, I own, are &s;o affected by the company of unfortunate per&s;ons, that I am obliged, in regard to my health, to avoid them carefully. And I really blame Mrs. Meynell quite as much as I pity her. She has enough to eat and drink, and clothes &s;ufficient to keep her

warm and comfortable; but &s;he mu&s;t be hurt, for&s;ooth, becau&s;e her appear|ance is &s;habby. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he wants to be dre&s;&s;ed like Mrs. Seymour, which is ab&s;urd enough." "Then," &s;aid Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, "one's obliged to be &s;o upon one's guard in her company, for the lea&s;t hint about her &s;ituation brings a fit of tears directly. I recollect, la&s;t time I met her at your hou&s;e, you happened to &s;ay that you wondered, when people were poor, they didn't prefer &s;ome hone&s;t employment to living in poverty: I very innocently an&s;wered, that I &s;up|po&s;ed they found idlene&s;s ea&s;y enough; upon which &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and left the room in heroics, &s;aying, "If &s;uch a &s;ituation <HI>were</HI> ea&s;y, Madam, I &s;hould not be affected as I now am." "Really the&s;e airs are intolerable." "I own," &s;aid Julia, "what &s;trikes <HI>me</HI> as <HI>intolerable,</HI> was your hint about idle|ne&s;s; for I &s;ee nothing, but what is na|tural,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
in a woman of family and educa|tion re&s;enting di&s;re&s;pect." "Family!" interrupted Mrs. Melbourne, "the be&s;t thing, Mi&s;s Clifford, that people in po|verty can do, is to forget their preten|&s;ions to family, if any &s;uch they have; and this only requires the effort of a good under&s;tanding. Poverty, and high birth, are &s;uch an inconvenient alliance, that, if Mrs. Meynell cannot get rid of the fir&s;t, I would advi&s;e her by all means to bani&s;h the recollection of the latter. When &s;he comes into my draw|ing-room in an old gown, with the dig|nity of a Counte&s;s in her own right, and expects di&s;tinction on account of her family, &s;he really &s;trikes me as a very ridiculous figure." "Ridiculous indeed!" exclaimed Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, with a laugh: "it puts me in mind of my green parrot, when his feathers have moulted.

with all the exultation po&s;&s;ible, though they are as bare as a picked fowl." "I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid Julia, colour|ing with indignation, "Mrs. Meynell as deficient in under&s;tanding as your green parrot, Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, before I can believe &s;he would expect attention from <HI>you,</HI> when &s;he was not in <HI>full</HI> feather: I am &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t long ago have di&s;covered your partiality for fine plumage." Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was a little aba&s;hed by this &s;peech, and before &s;he had recovered her&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently for the "reproof valiant," Mrs. Meynell was announced; whom Julia received with di&s;tingui&s;hed politene&s;s, while Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> bit her lips, and was ready to exclaim, "Why &s;hould the poor be flattered?"

<PB N="106" REF="107">
civilities to Mrs. Meynell as an extra|vagant profu&s;ion of an article, which, if properly applied, might be turned to &s;ome account.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Seymour and her party ro&s;e to take leave, after wi&s;hing Julia good morning, &s;he turned to Mrs. Meynell, and &s;aid, "Shall I &s;et you down?&mdash;but I mu&s;t explain that it's not in my power to take you to your own door; your lodging is &s;o out of the world, and I have a great circuit to make to my mother's, and Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, and very little time this morning." "It's quite unnece&s;&s;ary to make any apology to me," replied Mrs. Meynell, coldly. "Well, but do give me leave to take you <HI>part</HI> of the way," rejoined Mrs. Seymour: "I'll &s;et you down at the top of the Hay|market, wherever the &s;treet looks toler|ably clean; and then at lea&s;t you'll be within a &s;hilling fare of home."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">
"I &s;hall certainly put you to no in|convenience on my account," &s;aid Mrs. Meynell: "be&s;ides, I mean to &s;tay a little longer with Mi&s;s Clifford." Up|on this, Mrs. Seymour made her a &s;light curte&s;y, and departed.</P>
<P>When the&s;e ladies were gone, Mrs. Meynell and Julia enjoyed a conver&s;a|tion which rendered them more and more plea&s;ed with each other; and, after con&s;enting to dine at Mr. Clifford's, the following day, and Julia having ap|pointed an hour at which &s;he would call for her in the carriage, Mrs. Meynell departed, &s;oothed and gratified by her vi&s;it. Julia's attentive kindne&s;s &s;eemed to her de&s;olate heart like a &s;olitary flower, that di&s;pen&s;es its reviving &s;weet|ne&s;s amid&s;t &s;urrounding thorns. But the plea&s;ure &s;he derived from her vi&s;it, was embittered by &s;ome farther circum|&s;tances of mortification: for, when &s;he reached Mr. Clifford's &s;treet-door, the
<PB N="108" REF="109">
&s;ervant who opened it informed her that it rained a little; and a&s;ked if &s;he cho&s;e to have a coach. Mrs. Meynell, who was con&s;cious that &s;he had but a &s;ingle &s;hilling in her pocket, which was in&s;ufficient to pay her coach-hire home, and which, if &s;pent, would expo&s;e her to much brutality from her hu&s;band, told the &s;ervant that the rain was &s;o trifling, it was of no con&s;equence; and went away, walking very fa&s;t till &s;he got out of &s;ight of the hou&s;e. When &s;he reach|ed Piccadilly, &s;he met Capt. Meynell, and the &s;hower increa&s;ing, they were obliged to take &s;helter under the porch of a door. In a few minutes, Mrs. Seymour, who had &s;et down her mother in Hanover-&s;quare, and had &s;ince been at &s;ome &s;hops in Bond-&s;treet, pa&s;&s;ed in her carriage, with Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. The rain was now &s;o violent, that Mrs. Sey|mour felt it was impo&s;&s;ible not to offer to take Mrs. Meynell home. She there|fore
<PB N="109" REF="110">
&s;topped the carriage, and begged they would come in. Mrs. Meynell, much mortified at being obliged to ac|cept this offer, entered the carriage with regret, and her hu&s;band followed.</P>
<P>"My dear Mrs. Meynell," &s;aid Mrs. Seymour, as the carriage drove on, "I wonder you venture out &s;uch days as the&s;e: what would you have done if we had not happened to pa&s;s?" "Why," replied Mrs. Meynell, waited quietly till the &s;hower was over." "But," rejoined Mrs. Seymour, in a tone of affected &s;ympathy, "I'm really &s;urpri&s;ed you don't catch your death of cold, walking in &s;uch weather as this." "Why, you know, Mrs. Seymour," &s;aid Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, "there's a great deal in habit: I &s;uppo&s;e it would kill either you or me, but Mrs. Meynell is u&s;ed to it." "Ah," thought Mrs. Meynell, "Is it the fault of poverty, Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, if its path is rugged, and be&s;et with
<PB N="110" REF="111">
thorns, that you find &s;atisfaction in pointing their edge, and making the feet of the weary traveller bleed on his pilgrimage? Is it a crime in penury, if its bo&s;om is defencele&s;s, that you love to poi&s;on the arrows which pierce it?" Capt. Meynell, who had &s;en&s;e enough to comprehend the in&s;olence of Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s ob&s;ervation on the force of habit, an&s;wered, in his u&s;ual blunt tone, "Why, faith, Ma'am, Mrs. Meynell, till lately, was as little <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to walk in wet weather as your&s;elf; and if we go to her ance&s;tors, I believe, we &s;hall find they have been u&s;ed to a coach longer than any of the forefathers of this pre|&s;ent company:&mdash;for in&s;tance, Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, I read in the new&s;papers, that your family was made noble about five years ago, and Mrs. Meynell's has been noble about five hundred."

<PB N="111" REF="112">
ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence the re&s;t of the way.</P>
<P>Mrs. Meynell returned home, &s;carcely finding, in the recollection of Julia's &s;weetne&s;s, a compen&s;ation for the mor|tifications which had attended her vi&s;it. Capt. Meynell was in ill-humour at &s;eeing his wife treated with di&s;re&s;pect. But, though he &s;aw the tears of vexa|tion fill her eyes, he comforted him&s;elf with the reflection, that her regret would pa&s;s away, and that, in the mean time, he had &s;aved coach-hire to the amount of eighteen-pence. He had no conception of the keenne&s;s of his wife's &s;en&s;ations, and was entirely ignorant, that though, when a blow is levelled at the <HI>body,</HI> the degree of its force is known, it is impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s what pain may be inflicted by a blow which is aimed at the <HI>mind.</HI> But Capt.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>JULIA, offended at the expre&s;&s;ions which Frederick Seymour had u&s;ed at their late interview, carefully &s;hunned all particular conver&s;ation with him; though this was accompli&s;hed with great difficulty, for &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed without their meeting. Mr. Clifford was never happy but in his daughter's &s;ociety. Their parties were generally the &s;ame, their vi&s;its were of|ten made together, and Frederick Sey|mour u&s;ually placed him&s;elf next Julia, except when by &s;ome contrivance &s;he put it out of his power. Charlotte, who had not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the real &s;tate of her hu&s;band's mind, was
<PB N="114" REF="115">
plea&s;ed to &s;ee him renew his former at|tention to her friend; till &s;ome circum|&s;tances, which we mu&s;t now relate, brought the fatal &s;ecret of his pa&s;&s;ion to the knowledge of the unhappy Char|lotte.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour's plan for the accom|pli&s;hment of his ba&s;e de&s;igns on Mrs. Meynell, was &s;uch as &s;uited a mind har|dened in the practice of vice. He meant to reduce her to extreme di&s;tre&s;s; and per&s;uaded Captain Meynell, over whom he had acquired great influence, by promi&s;es of a place, or pen&s;ion, to remain in London. The&s;e promi&s;es, Mr. Seymour never meant to fulfil, till Mrs. Meynell, reduced to ab&s;olute want, and &s;inking in de&s;pair, might be driven to accept his a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the only terms on which he was determined to be&s;tow it.</P>
<P>It has before been mentioned, that Mr. Seymour entertained but a con|temptible
<PB N="115" REF="116">
opinion of the &s;trength of fe|male virtue: he had, therefore, formed his machinations, as he imagined, with the mo&s;t artful &s;kill, and entertained no doubt of his final &s;ucce&s;s. Meanwhile, he per&s;ecuted this unhappy lady with his vi&s;its; expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathy in her &s;ituation, and endea|voured to &s;ooth her with offers of &s;er|vice. But he was not a little alarmed, when he heard that Mrs. Evans was hou&s;ekeeper at Mr. Clifford's; being convinced, from what he knew of her character, that &s;he would betray his de|&s;igns to Julia. He al&s;o fancied he perceived a change in her manner to|wards him: but what gave him far greater vexation was, the progre&s;s of that young lady's friend&s;hip for Mrs. Meynell; for he &s;aw that at the very mo|ment when he was ready to &s;eize upon his prey, Julia's friend&s;hip would re&s;cue her from his gra&s;p. He was now fre|quently
<PB N="116" REF="117">
deprived of &s;eeing Mrs. Mey|nell, who &s;pent much of her time at Mr. Clifford's; and when &s;he was at home, he was often debarred any particular conver&s;ation with her, by finding Julia of the party. Two months were pa&s;&s;ed by him in this unea&s;y &s;tate of mind, when he accidentally heard, that Mr. Clifford was making intere&s;t to obtain a very profitable appointment for Capt. Meynell, in the Ea&s;t Indies. Mr. Sey|mour well knew, that Mr. Clifford's influence would render the &s;ucce&s;s of his application certain. Enraged be|yond all bounds at this di&s;covery, which at once fru&s;trated all his deep|laid &s;chemes, and would place the ob|ject of his pur&s;uit entirely out of his power, he returned to his own hou&s;e with his whole &s;oul boiling with indig|nation again&s;t Julia, whom he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the chief mover in this application of Mr. Clifford's.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
Mr. Seymour was ha&s;tening to con|ceal his emotion in his library, when, meeting Mrs. Seymour on the &s;tairs, &s;he a&s;ked him to come into her dre&s;&s;|ing-room, &s;aying &s;he had &s;omething to tell him. When they reached the dre&s;&s;|ing-room, "O, Mr. Seymour," &s;aid &s;he, "I have &s;uch a &s;trange piece of intelligence for you; and I want to know your opinion of it. I have this moment heard, from a per&s;on who&s;e pe|netration may be well tru&s;ted, that your brother Frederick is de&s;perately in love with Julia Clifford, and &s;he with him, and that they were &s;o before his mar|riage." Mr. Seymour, who&s;e prudence would have led him, in a calmer mo|ment, to contradict a report which might produce the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quences, being now entirely thrown off his guard by pa&s;&s;ion, di&s;appointment, and indignation, ha&s;tily an&s;wered, that "if Mrs. Seymour had had much
<PB N="118" REF="119">
penetration, &s;he might have found out that circum&s;tance her&s;elf." "Is it re|ally true?" &s;aid Mrs. Seymour. "I can't talk of it at pre&s;ent," he replied, impa|tiently, "for I have an appointment, and mu&s;t be gone." He then went ha&s;tily out of the hou&s;e; for he found him&s;elf unable to &s;upport either Mrs. Seymour's company, or the &s;olitude of his library. His impetuous pa&s;&s;ions had met with the rude&s;t &s;hock: the machinations of years were in a mo|ment defeated. Stung almo&s;t to mad|ne&s;s by the failure of his de&s;igns, he found no relief in tho&s;e projects of am|bition, which u&s;ually occupied his a&s;pir|ing mind. Every object on earth ap|peared indifferent to him but that which was lo&s;t, and he gave way to un|controuled rage, frenzy and de&s;pair. If the guilty, even in &s;ucce&s;s, are unhappy, how complete is their mi&s;ery in di&s;ap|pointment! It is the natural tendency
<PB N="119" REF="120">
of vice to depre&s;s the mind, which, when loaded with the additional weight of &s;orrow, &s;inks into a deep aby&s;s of de&s;pondency; while the buoyant &s;pirit of virtue re&s;i&s;ts the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity, and floats upon the &s;tormy ocean of life, un&s;ubdued by the tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>When the violent agitation of Mr. Seymour's mind had a little &s;ub&s;ided, he reflected on the imprudence into which re&s;entment had led him, in a&s;|&s;enting to a report which might in|volve his brother in &s;o much mi&s;ery. He therefore ha&s;tened home, in or|der to enquire from whom his wife had received her intelligence, and to charge her never to repeat it to any per|&s;on whatever. But he reached home too late. Mrs. Seymour was gone out; and, as he had long perceived her envy of Julia's beauty, and was well acquainted with her di&s;po&s;ition, he &s;u&s;pected &s;he would be &s;ufficiently ready to repeat any thing to her di&s;advantage. As &s;oon
<PB N="120" REF="121">
as Mrs. Seymour returned, he de&s;ired to know from whom &s;he had received the information &s;he had given him, re|&s;pecting Frederick and Julia. Mrs. Seymour, after &s;ome he&s;itation, being again urged by her hu&s;band to declare the author of this intelligence, at length mentioned Mi&s;s Tomkins. Mr. Sey|mour flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion; &s;wore that the circum&s;tance gave him a diabo|lical idea of Mi&s;s Tomkins; and that he was convinced, &s;he had mentioned her &s;u&s;picions from &s;ome &s;ecret malig|nity towards Julia, who, he added, was too beautiful to e&s;cape the per&s;ecution of the women. He then enquired if Mrs. Seymour had repeated to any per&s;on what &s;he had heard? She acknowledged that &s;he had called upon Mrs. Chartres; that they had talked of Frederick Sey|mour; and that her &s;on, who was at home, had mentioned &s;o many &s;trange circum&s;tances in Seymour's behaviour, both before and &s;ince his marriage, that
<PB N="121" REF="122">
&s;he was convinced he had di&s;covered the &s;ecret: &s;he had therefore ventured to remark, that it was a little unfortu|nate for poor Frederick, that his wife's cou&s;in was hand&s;omer than her&s;elf. "But," added Mrs. Seymour, "I real|ly repented exceedingly what I had &s;aid, when I found, that though Chartres repeated a thou&s;and circum&s;tances which would have brought conviction to any per&s;on of le&s;s &s;implicity than him&s;elf, he had remarked the effects, without ever conjecturing the cau&s;e. I am really va&s;tly &s;orry for what is pa&s;t, but I am certain that neither Chartres or his mo|ther will ever mention this affair." Mr. Seymour, however, was much di&s;turbed at this recital, and appeared far le&s;s cer|tain than his wife, of Mrs. Chartres's capacity for keeping a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary to explain the mo|tives which influenced Mi&s;s Tomkins, in communicating the above-mentioned intelligence to Mrs. Seymour. Mi&s;s
<PB N="122" REF="123">
Tomkins had, in the cour&s;e of the win|ter, frequently been of the &s;ame parties with Julia, at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s, at Mr. Seymour's, Mr. Clifford's, and other places. Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was always of the&s;e parties, and his attention was uniform|ly devoted to Julia. In vain Mi&s;s Tomkins hoped that Julia's indifference would at length conquer his pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ince farther acquaintance with that young lady did but add to his admira|tion of her beauty the mo&s;t confirmed e&s;teem for her character. Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had penetration enough to perceive that Mi&s;s Tomkins re&s;ented his prefer|ence of Julia; but he was not of a tem|per to be compelled to pay any atten|tion, to which he was not prompted by inclination. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that fini&s;hed politene&s;s, which levels all the di&s;tinctions of the heart, and ca&s;ts an impenetrable veil over its feelings. Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, on the contrary, acted from the
<PB N="123" REF="124">
impul&s;es of his own mind, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that independent frankne&s;s of &s;pirit which openly avows its prefer|ences, and is at no pains to conceal di&s;|like.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Tomkins, who had flattered her&s;elf, during the &s;pace of &s;ome months, with delu&s;ive expectations of detaching Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> from Julia, returned home one evening from a party, where &s;he had &s;uffered &s;o much mortification from that gentleman's neglect of her&s;elf, and attention to her rival, that, &s;tung by en|vy, re&s;entment, and de&s;pair, &s;he deter|mined to go the next morning, and re|late what &s;he had ob&s;erved, of Frederick Seymour and Julia's mutual attach|ment, to Mrs. Seymour; through whom &s;he hoped the report would &s;pread wide enough at lea&s;t to reach Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s ear; and Mi&s;s Tomkins believed, that if the high opinion which he entertained of Julia's character was le&s;&s;ened, his admiration of her beauty would prove
<PB N="124" REF="125">
a tran&s;ient &s;entiment, and might &s;oon change its object. Mi&s;s Tomkins ac|cordingly went to Mrs. Seymour the next morning, related her &s;u&s;picions, and had ju&s;t left the hou&s;e when Mr. Seymour returned home.</P>
<P>His apprehen&s;ions, with re&s;pect to Mrs. Chartres, were too well found|ed. The moment Mrs. Seymour de|parted, big with the &s;ecret, full of anger again&s;t Julia, and pity for Char|lotte, (who was her favourite on ac|count of a pre&s;ent of potted hare, and a long Indian &s;hawl) Mrs. Char|tres ha&s;tened to Frederick Seymour's hou&s;e, found Charlotte alone, and, with|out much circumlocution, began by lamenting the caprice and incon&s;tan|cy of men; and, after &s;ome general abu&s;e of the &s;ex, fini&s;hed her harangue by informing Charlotte of the report &s;he had heard.&mdash;Charlotte was too much &s;truck by the intelligence to have the power of making any reply.
<PB N="125" REF="126">
She only, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome mo|ments, told Mrs. Chartres, in a faint voice, that &s;he felt her&s;elf not very well, that &s;he wi&s;hed to go to her own room, and begged &s;he would excu&s;e her.&mdash;Mrs. Chartres, after &s;ome very common|place expre&s;&s;ions of condolence, took her leave, quite uncon&s;cious of the degree of mi&s;ery &s;he had occa&s;ion|ed.</P>
<P>Charlotte immediately retired to her room, in a &s;ituation of which no words can convey an adequate idea. Every fa|culty of her &s;oul &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended; &s;he felt a &s;en&s;ation as if a heavy weight had been laid upon her heart; &s;he could not &s;hed a tear; her memory retained every image confu&s;edly; her brain was a chaos of perplexity and di&s;order; and &s;he found that to think, was di&s;traction. When &s;he had recovered the fir&s;t numbing &s;troke of &s;urprize, and horror, which &s;eemed almo&s;t to annihilate her mind, the re|collection of her pa&s;t happine&s;s called
<PB N="126" REF="127">
forth her tears, and &s;he wept for a con|&s;iderable time with great violence. Her reflections now threw a gleam of fatal light on the pa&s;t. A thou&s;and circum|&s;tances, which had hitherto appeared whim&s;ical or capricious in Seymour, were now too plainly accounted for, and the horrible &s;u&s;picion became every mo|ment more confirmed to her di&s;tracted mind.</P>
<P>Alas! in the &s;ad catalogue of hu|man evils, what calamity is &s;o difficult to bear, as the di&s;covery of indiffer|ence in that object to whom we have given our affections, and intru&s;ted our happine&s;s!&mdash;when we find that heart alienated, who&s;e tenderne&s;s &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence; when we read coldne&s;s in that eye, on who&s;e look our peace depends!&mdash;How &s;evere are tho&s;e pangs, for which we mu&s;t not a&s;k for &s;ympathy, that angui&s;h, which mu&s;t be nouri&s;hed in &s;ecret, and endured without complaint!&mdash;while memory recalls the
<PB N="127" REF="128">
images of the pa&s;t, traces with cruel exactne&s;s the &s;cenes which &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ionate mark of fondne&s;s, &s;ome proof of former attachment have endeared for ever!&mdash;repeats tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of ten|derne&s;s which are recorded in the heart; reminds us even of the tone in which they were uttered, and gives additional bitter|ne&s;s to our pains!&mdash;In vain we &s;ummon fortitude to our aid. The efforts of rea&s;on are in&s;ufficient to &s;tifle the ago|nies of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ilence the voice of de&s;pair!&mdash;Time may at length bid the&s;e violent emotions &s;ub&s;ide: mi&s;ery will become habitual, and the mind may, in &s;ome degree, accommodate it|&s;elf to its &s;ituation: but it mu&s;t pa&s;s through many a &s;evere extreme, it mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain many a terrible conflict before it is thus made familiar with &s;orrow, or finds a refuge from it in the grave!</P>
<P>Sometimes, in the bitterne&s;s of her grief, Charlotte felt an impul&s;e to fly to
<PB N="128" REF="129">
Julia, and repo&s;e her angui&s;h on the bo|&s;om of her friend. But &s;he &s;uddenly re|collected, with increa&s;ed affliction, that this con&s;olation was denied to her &s;or|rows. Friend&s;hip, and love, &s;eemed lo&s;t together, and her whole &s;y&s;tem of happi|ne&s;s was wrecked at once.&mdash;Thus the af|frighted &s;hepherd on the plains of Sicily, when the de&s;olating fires of the volcano have de&s;troyed his beloved cottage, and con&s;umed his little trea&s;ure, longs to fly to the &s;helter of &s;ome holy temple, where his tutelar &s;aints may protect him from farther calamity; but perceiving with horror the &s;acred fabric totter, the &s;ainted &s;hrines tremble: every ray of hope at once for&s;akes his di&s;tracted &s;pi|rit.</P>

<P>THE unhappy Charlotte wiped away her tears before the re|turn of her hu&s;band; for her good &s;en&s;e taught her, that repining, or complaint, would only &s;erve to tear a&s;under the la&s;t weak cords of affection, and alto|gether detach a heart, which &s;he was now &s;en&s;ible &s;he held only by the ties of pity. Love is a plant of delicate texture, and, when it droops, will never be revived by the tears of reproach; which, like petrifying drops, harden, in&s;tead of cheri&s;hing, the &s;pot where they fall.</P>
<P>Charlotte did not &s;ee Julia till two days after this fatal di&s;covery, when they met at a concert at Mrs. Seymour's.
<PB N="130" REF="131">
Though but little di&s;po&s;ed for mu&s;ic or company, Charlotte felt that it would be an ea&s;ier ta&s;k to go out, than to evade the anxious enquiries her fa|ther would make into the cau&s;e of her remaining at home. And, what per|haps weighed more with her than this con&s;ideration, was a con&s;cious dread which hung upon her mind of betray|ing her feelings to Julia, whom &s;he therefore wi&s;hed fir&s;t to meet in the bu&s;tle of a croud.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford cho&s;e to go early, and he and Julia came before any other company. They found Mrs. Seymour with Bijoux in her lap; when &s;he rung the bell for her maid to come and take charge of him, before any more com|pany arrived. The maid advanced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively towards him, patted his head very gently, and told her mi&s;tre&s;s how happy &s;he was to &s;ee him in &s;uch good &s;pirits; and &s;he was &s;ure his
<PB N="131" REF="132">
chicken had done him good. After more comments of the &s;ame kind, re|peated in the tone and manner in which &s;he would have addre&s;&s;ed a young &s;on and heir, and accompanied with many re&s;pectful endearments, Bijoux, who was more remarkable for beauty than good temper, &s;narling at being di&s;|turbed, was tenderly care&s;&s;ed by his mi&s;tre&s;s, and at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Charlotte came alone. Her father and Julia ha&s;tened to &s;peak to her, and Mr. Clifford took notice that &s;he look|ed pale. But Charlotte declared &s;he was perfectly well, and forced her&s;elf to chat in her u&s;ual gay and ea&s;y manner, till her heart &s;unk at the exertion, and &s;he contrived to place her&s;elf between two ladies who were &s;trangers to her, and with whom no conver&s;ation was nece&s;&s;ary. However, &s;he &s;oon repented of this mea&s;ure; for, in the beginning of the fir&s;t act of the concert, Frederick
<PB N="132" REF="133">
Seymour entered the room, &s;poke for a few moments to his wife as he pa&s;&s;ed, then ha&s;tened to the other end of the room, on pretence of paying his com|pliments to Mrs. Seymour, and, after a very &s;hort conver&s;ation with that lady, placed him&s;elf on a &s;eat behind Julia, and talked to her earne&s;tly. She an|&s;wered but &s;eldom, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h to li&s;ten to the mu&s;ic; but Charlotte &s;aw that Seymour con&s;tantly renewed the conver&s;ation. The heart of Char|lotte was &s;tung by &s;en&s;ations, which &s;he had never felt before: jealou&s;y had now taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her bo&s;om; its &s;harp-edged "iron had entered into her &s;oul!" The ladies, who were &s;eated next her, had endeavoured to engage her in di&s;cour&s;e, and her natural di&s;po|&s;ition to oblige &s;o far conquered her re|luctance to &s;peak, that &s;he an&s;wered them with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s. But, upon Seymour's placing him&s;elf by
<PB N="133" REF="134">
Julia, Charlotte's eyes wandered after him, her voice changed, and, though her companions &s;till continued to talk, &s;he no longer knew what they &s;aid, or what &s;he her&s;elf replied. Her mind was in a &s;tate of uncontroulable agita|tion; and, though mu&s;ic has power to &s;ooth a gentle, or even a deep and &s;et|tled melancholy, the torments of jea|lou&s;y, the agonies of &s;u&s;pence, rai&s;e a tempe&s;t in the &s;oul, which no harmony can lull to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She thought <HI>that</HI> act of the concert would never fini&s;h, and, the moment it was over, moved her &s;eat, on pretence of &s;peaking to Julia about an engage|ment the following day. She had &s;carcely &s;eated her&s;elf by Julia, when Frederick Seymour ro&s;e, and went to &s;peak to &s;ome gentlemen at another part of the room. Charlotte was &s;o much hurt at his changing his place the moment &s;he approached, which in a calmer &s;tate of
<PB N="134" REF="135">
mind &s;he would not even have ob&s;erved, that &s;he could &s;carcely re&s;train her tears. But her agitation was concealed by the approach of Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who came with great eagerne&s;s, to declare how much the company had been mi&s;taken in their admiration of a &s;ong, which had been ju&s;t &s;ung by a young lady; and which, it was the general opinion, had been executed with the mo&s;t pathe|tic &s;weetne&s;s and &s;implicity. Other performances of the evening had been applauded, with the u&s;ual exclamations of "Very fine! Charming! Wonderful execution! &amp;c.;" but, when this &s;ong was fini&s;hed, the cant terms of admira|tion were forgotten, while every eye gli&s;tened with plea&s;ure, and every heart &s;eemed affected. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> alone was quite a&s;toni&s;hed that the &s;ong was &s;o liked. "For her part," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;he thought it extremely in&s;ipid; and &s;he knew that Mrs. Seymour, who was &s;o
<PB N="135" REF="136">
good a judge of mu&s;ic, admired that lady's &s;tyle of &s;inging quite as little as her&s;elf." "Ah," thought Julia, "when will Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> or Mrs. Seymour ad|mire excellence?" Julia's reflection was founded on a ju&s;t knowledge of the character of the&s;e ladies. The lu&s;|tre of excellence is as painful to envy, as the rays of the &s;un to the bird of night, who loves to pour his &s;hrill cry when the birds of &s;weete&s;t note are ab|&s;ent, and to flap his &s;able wings when they cannot be contra&s;ted with the ma|je&s;tic plumage of the &s;wan, or the beau|tiful feathers of the peacock.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> did not encroach on her &s;i&s;ter's department of critici&s;ing the &s;ong, but undertook her|&s;elf to critici&s;e the &s;inger, whom Charles Seymour having pronounced to be beau|tiful, &s;he in&s;tantly exclaimed, "Well, I wonder you can think her hand&s;ome; her &s;kin's &s;o coar&s;e, and her colour &s;o

<P>Before the &s;econd act of the concert began, Charlotte, who was &s;tanding near the harp&s;ichord, with a little cir|cle of acquaintances, with whom &s;he had no inclination to conver&s;e, turned over &s;ome leaves of a mu&s;ic-book, which lay upon the in&s;trument, and found the &s;ong, the &s;imple melody of which had been applauded.

Julia had gone, a &s;hort time before, to the card-room with &s;ome ladies. Char|lotte, when &s;he reached the &s;eat, looked round for her hu&s;band, but he was not in the concert-room, and &s;he concluded he had followed Julia. The performers were now preparing to begin the &s;econd act; and Charlotte, who knew that the &s;ound of the mu&s;ic would immediately draw Julia to the concert-room, longed as impatiently for the beginning of the &s;e|cond act, as &s;he had wi&s;hed for the con|clu&s;ion of the fir&s;t; thought &s;he had never known people &s;o tedious in tuning in&s;truments, and began to fear tho&s;e ob&s;tinate violins would never be in uni|&s;on.

beat in uni&s;on to plea&s;ure or tranquillity. In a few minutes the mu&s;ic began, and the company returned to the concert|room.

<P>CHARLOTTE did not long &s;uc|ceed in concealing her affliction from Julia, who &s;oon ob&s;erved that her gaiety was a&s;&s;umed, and that &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e of &s;orrow hung upon her &s;pirits. The &s;ource of her mi&s;ery &s;he could not di&s;cover; for, though &s;he had often wondered that Charlotte had never di&s;|cerned any traces of Seymour's unfor|tunate attachment, yet, &s;ince it had re|mained &s;o long concealed, and &s;ince no particular circum&s;tance had lately ari&s;en to awaken &s;u&s;picion, Julia concluded that his wife was &s;till as ignorant of it as ever. In &s;pite of all her efforts, Charlotte &s;ometimes appeared ab&s;ent
<PB N="144" REF="145">
and thoughtful; but, when accu&s;ed of gravity by Julia, &s;he would &s;tart, as from a dream, and endeavour to &s;mile at being &s;u&s;pected of low &s;pirits; yet Julia's penetration di&s;cerned, that the &s;mile was artificial, and the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s real. She went in vain the round of conjecture on this &s;ubject. Sometimes a &s;u&s;picion came acro&s;s her mind, that Seymour's attachment to her&s;elf was betrayed; but &s;he felt &s;uch horror at the idea, that &s;he in&s;tantly endeavoured to bani&s;h it from her imagination.</P>
<P>The time drew near when Mr. Char|tres was to embark for the Ea&s;t Indies. He was convinced that his going to India was a thing fit and right, and an expedition he owed his country, on ac|count of his projected improvements in philo&s;ophy, at his return: but, notwith|&s;tanding he had the welfare of philo&s;o|phy much at heart, when the hour of his departure approached, he felt that the
<PB N="145" REF="146">
thoughts of &s;eparation from tho&s;e he loved, excited a &s;en&s;ation of unea&s;ine&s;s, which the pro&s;pect of future advantage to &s;cience had no power to remove; and that there was a chilling principle in &s;orrow, which damped the ardor of philo&s;ophical re&s;earch, to a degree he had till now thought impo&s;&s;ible. Char|tres, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an affectionate and grateful heart, felt him&s;elf bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of obligation to Mr. Clifford, and would have &s;acrificed his life to render him the &s;malle&s;t &s;ervice. He had the mo&s;t &s;incere e&s;teem for Char|lotte, but Julia's &s;oftne&s;s had won his &s;oul. She was his friend, his confidant, his coun&s;ellor; and he would certainly have been in love with her, if he had not fore&s;een how inconvenient he &s;hould find &s;uch a turbulent &s;en&s;ation at the di&s;tance of Bengal. He determin|ed therefore to confine his tenderne&s;s within the peaceful limits of friend&s;hip;
<PB N="146" REF="147">
for he had heard, and gave &s;ome credit to the information, that when the heart ventured to &s;tray beyond that tranquil boundary, the path, if &s;ometimes cover|ed with ro&s;es, was oftener tangled with briars; and the &s;ky, if occa&s;ionally gilded by the rainbow, was more fre|quently ob&s;cured by the tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Chartres came the day before his de|parture to bid Julia farewel. The tear &s;tood in his eye, his heart &s;eemed deeply depre&s;&s;ed, and he repeatedly declar|ed, that he looked forward to no other happine&s;s at his return than that of en|joying her &s;ociety; for in the&s;e mo|ments his philo&s;ophical improvements were forgotten. He told her he had ju&s;t taken leave of Charlotte, whom he found alone, and in great dejection, her eyes were red, and &s;he appeared to have been crying over &s;ome papers which were lying on the table. "I &s;aw mark|ed upon the back of one of them,"
<PB N="147" REF="148">
added Chartres, "Sonnet to Peace, written by Julia." "When, at part|ing," re&s;umed he, "Iwi&s;hed her every happine&s;s, &s;he bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears, &s;hook her head, and de&s;ired me not to talk of happine&s;s. I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he thought I was acquainted with that fal&s;e report which my mother was &s;o impru|dent as to repeat to her. I &s;ee it has made her unhappy, and &s;he has never been in good &s;pirits &s;ince." "What report?" &s;aid Julia, in a faint voice. Chartres then repeated the intelligence which Mrs. Seymour had given his mo|ther. Julia leaned back on her chair, and in a few moments bur&s;t into an agony of tears. "I wi&s;h I had not mentioned this affair," &s;aid Chartres, "if it makes you unea&s;y; but you have philo&s;ophy enough to de&s;pi&s;e it. I con|vinced Mrs. Seymour of its fal&s;ehood, not merely by vague a&s;&s;ertion, but by facts which had come under my own ob&s;ervation. I told her, that, far from
<PB N="148" REF="149">
having any liking to you, I had re|marked that he was never le&s;s agreeable than in your company; and was at &s;o little pains to entertain you, that I had frequently known him, while &s;peaking to you, forget what he was going to &s;ay; that whenever any body mentioned you, he &s;eemed to find the &s;ubject di&s;|agreeable, and always a&s;&s;ented to your prai&s;e as coldly as if he thought you did not de&s;erve it."</P>
<P>Chartres was proceeding to relate the farther proofs he had given of Seymour's indifference, for his audi|tor had no power to interrupt him; but at this moment Mr. Clifford knock|ed at the door, and Julia, with a great effort, &s;ummoned &s;ufficient &s;trength to implore Chartres not to repeat to her uncle a report which would give him &s;o much unhappine&s;s. Before Mr. Clifford reached the room, Chartres promi&s;ed, not only that he never would repeat it him&s;elf, but that he would
<PB N="149" REF="150">
al&s;o bind his mother in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner never to mention it again.</P>
<P>When Mr. Clifford appeared, Julia took leave of Chartres, and with &s;ome difficulty reached her own apartment, &s;hut the door, and flung her&s;elf on a chair, covering her face with her hands, in an agony of mind almo&s;t in&s;upport|able. "At length," thought &s;he, "the &s;torm which has &s;o long threatened me bur&s;ts upon my head:&mdash;Charlotte! Oh, Charlotte! mu&s;t I be the wretched cau&s;e of your mi&s;ery? Mu&s;t I embitter all the fair pro&s;pects of your life, and overwhelm that affectionate heart with intolerable angui&s;h? Why do I live to fill with de&s;pair that bo&s;om which has &s;upported and cheri&s;hed me?&mdash;Oh, my father, my ever beloved father! would that the &s;ame grave which holds thee, had covered thy unfortunate child!&mdash;Why did my uncle receive me beneath
<PB N="150" REF="151">
his roof? Oh, far happier had it been for me to have been ca&s;t out a de&s;erted or|phan, than thus to &s;pread de&s;olation and horror in his family; to reward his be|nevolence by inflicting the &s;harpe&s;t ca|lamity, by wounding him in the per&s;on of his child.&mdash;Yes, wretch that I am! by planting a dagger in the heart of Charlotte, I &s;hall bring her father with &s;orrow to the grave. Perhaps his la&s;t breath will cur&s;e me!&mdash;no, he will pity and forgive me!&mdash;but will not his pity, his forgivene&s;s, be more piercing than reproach, more terrible than his cur&s;e?"</P>
<P>Julia's mind was long ab&s;orbed by the&s;e de&s;ponding reflections. She gave way to uncontrouled affliction; &s;ent Mr. Clifford word, that &s;he was not well; and kept her room the remainder of the day. When her thoughts had recovered their fir&s;t confu&s;ion and ter|ror, &s;he deliberated on her future con|duct; but knew not on what to deter|mine.

At one moment &s;he thought of flying to Charlotte, of unbo&s;oming her di&s;tre&s;s, and then for&s;aking her uncle's hou&s;e for ever: at another moment &s;he wi&s;hed to find a refuge with Mrs. Mey|nell. But farther reflection convinced her that any of the&s;e mea&s;ures would accele|rate the mi&s;chiefs &s;he &s;o much dreaded, by revealing the fatal &s;ecret to her uncle, without mitigating, in the lea&s;t degree, the wretchedne&s;s of Charlotte. Julia, therefore, re&s;olved to bear her &s;uffer|ings in &s;ilence, to devote her&s;elf to her uncle's happine&s;s, and to &s;hun Frede|rick Seymour more carefully than ever.</P>
<P>Mean time Mrs. Seymour, &s;ome|what a&s;hamed of her conduct to Mrs. Meynell on the rainy morning, deter|mined to pay her a vi&s;it in her way to a party at no great di&s;tance; and, about eight o'clock in the evening, drove, with Mrs. Melbourne, to Charles|&s;treet.
<PB N="152" REF="153">
Mrs. Meynell had already drank tea, and, having devoted the day to mantua-making, had given orders not to be at home. But her &s;ervant had gone out, unknown to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and the woman of the hou&s;e came up, al|mo&s;t out of breath, &s;aying, "There were &s;ome ladies waiting in a carriage to know if &s;he would &s;ee them." "Where is my &s;ervant?" &s;aid Mrs. Meynell, in great di&s;tre&s;s, "Have you &s;aid I was at home?" "Yes, Ma'am; but I told them I did not know whether you would chu&s;e to &s;ee company." "Then I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee them," &s;aid Mrs. Meynell; who, though mortified at their intru&s;ion, threw off her embarra&s;&s;|ment, and received them with that ea&s;e and dignity which commanded re&s;pect. Mrs. Seymour &s;aid, &s;he was come to wait upon her to tea; but on this hint, Mrs. Meynell remained quite pa&s;&s;ive, being &s;en&s;ible that it was needle&s;s to ring the
<PB N="153" REF="154">
bell, &s;ince there was no per&s;on to an|&s;wer it. The children in the room above were crying in a mo&s;t terrible manner, and the mother, in order to quiet the younge&s;t, having put it into the cradle, began rocking with a degree of violence that &s;hook Mrs. Seymour's nerves exceedingly; who expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urprize at Mrs. Meynell's remaining in &s;uch a lodging. At length the &s;er|vant returned, and at length tea was procured; the cradle cea&s;ed to be rocked; and Mrs. Seymour's nerves cea&s;ed to be &s;haken.</P>
<P>Mrs. Meynell's conver&s;ation was that of an elegant and cultivated mind; and Mrs. Seymour, who hap|pened to be in good-humour, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ta&s;te and under&s;tanding, though &s;he &s;trangely perverted both, grew in&s;en&s;ibly plea&s;ed with Mrs. Mey|nell's di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;pite of her lodgings. As there were no gentlemen pre&s;ent, &s;he threw a&s;ide the graces of affecta|tion;
<PB N="154" REF="155">
and, without having the &s;malle&s;t intention to be agreeable, was really much more &s;o than u&s;ual: for &s;he was too apt to di&s;po&s;e the flowers of fancy with the formality of a trim parterre, when &s;he wi&s;hed to plea&s;e; and it was only in a carele&s;s moment that &s;he &s;uf|fered them to bloom with the graceful negligence of nature.</P>
<P>Charlotte and Julia now felt a mu|tual con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which embittered all their interviews; tho&s;e feelings of ten|der confidence which formerly made every moment of &s;eparation painful, being lo&s;t for ever. Julia &s;aw Char|lotte pining with &s;ecret grief, into which &s;he dur&s;t not enquire, and for which &s;he knew there was no remedy; and Charlotte felt a degree of re&s;traint in Julia's pre&s;ence, and often a pang of jealou&s;y, which made her avoid the &s;o|ciety of her cou&s;in, whenever &s;he could find a pretext for &s;o doing without ex|citing &s;u&s;picion in her father. But
<PB N="155" REF="156">
though &s;he &s;kilfully concealed her feel|ings from him, &s;he did not &s;ucceed in eluding the penetration of her hu&s;band. Frederick Seymour perceived, with in|quietude and di&s;appointment, that Ju|lia was le&s;s frequently at his hou&s;e than formerly; and, though accidental cir|cum&s;tances &s;eemed to prevent it, he was convinced, from &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions he had made on his wife's be|haviour, that Julia's ab&s;ence was no|thing le&s;s than accidental. The idea that his wife was unhappy, and un|happy from the di&s;covery of his at|tachment to another, filled him with the deepe&s;t concern; and he endea|voured, by every mark of attention and kindne&s;s, to cha&s;e from her mind tho&s;e gloomy &s;u&s;picions which he feared &s;he harboured. But this conduct could no longer confer happine&s;s on Charlotte: &s;he no longer mi&s;took attention for ten|derne&s;s, and kindne&s;s for love. Sey|mour
<PB N="156" REF="157">
was a bad di&s;&s;embler, and often &s;trove in vain to &s;uppre&s;s his feelings. When Charlotte cho&s;e to &s;tay at home, he frequently gave up his engagements to remain with her; but &s;till it ap|peared to Charlotte a matter of duty, and not of inclination. His talents were no longer exerted for her enter|tainment, no longer made the hours pa&s;s almo&s;t imperceptibly away. Char|lotte &s;ometimes talked to him on &s;ub|jects of ta&s;te and literature, of which he was fond, and on which he u&s;ed to give her his opinions with eagerne&s;s and animation; but he now an&s;wered her enquiries in a cold indifferent manner, which &s;hewed that he con&s;idered it as a ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he endeavoured to for|get her wretchedne&s;s, and tried to divert him by tho&s;e &s;prightly &s;allies with which he u&s;ed to be amu&s;ed; or indulged the fondne&s;s of her heart by
<PB N="157" REF="158">
an expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s; but &s;he &s;aw, or fancied &s;he &s;aw, that her gaiety, or her tenderne&s;s, were alike trouble|&s;ome, and received with a degree of coldne&s;s and gravity that petrified her &s;oul. On the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he conceal|ed her emotion till he left the room, and then gave way to the tears which &s;he had with difficulty &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Yet Seymour meant to give every proof of attachment, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to make her happy. But when tho&s;e at|tentions which belong to affection are prompted only by a &s;en&s;e of duty, there is often &s;ome failure in the execution, even with the greatect rectitude of in|tention. Such &s;ervices, when weighed in the &s;cale of rea&s;on, may prove rigo|rou&s;ly ju&s;t, but, in the balance of love, they will be found wanting. The head may under&s;tand the general theory of kindne&s;s, but the heart only can prac|ti&s;e the detail; as the &s;culptor can

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about the middle of June, and Mrs. Melbourne invited a par|ty to dine at her villa, near town. Charlotte was not well enough for this excur&s;ion. She expected in a &s;hort time to become a mother; and with delight had anticipated that period, when Sey|mour would have an additional rea&s;on for loving her; when the &s;miles of her infant would endear its mother, and convey, to the brea&s;t of both its parents, an emotion, which, though &s;he had not yet felt, her heart told her would be exqui&s;ite. But the&s;e dreams of happi|ne&s;s were no more: &s;he now only thought of the con&s;olation &s;he &s;hould
<PB N="161" REF="162">
find in bathing her uncon&s;cious infant with tears &s;hed in &s;ecret. When Char|lotte declined joining the party, Frede|rick Seymour declared he would re|main at home; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on his going. Julia took an opportunity of intreating Charlotte to allow her to &s;tay with her on the day of the party; but the offer was rejected with a degree of coldne&s;s, which &s;hocked Julia &s;o much, that &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the matter no farther.</P>
<P>The party, on their arrival at the villa, propo&s;ed to take a walk on the banks of the Thames. The villa was &s;ituated at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the village where Julia had formerly lived; and near Mrs. Melbourn's gate &s;he met with a poor woman, who&s;e hu&s;band, a labourer, u&s;ed to work in Captain Clif|ford's garden. Julia &s;topped, and beg|ged the company would walk on, while &s;he &s;poke to her old acquaintance. They gave the woman &s;ome money, and went
<PB N="162" REF="163">
towards the river. At the &s;ight of Ju|lia, the poor woman bur&s;t into tears. "Oh Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "I've been in a power of troubles &s;ince you left the country. I've lo&s;t my hu&s;band, Ma|dam, and a good &s;oul he was to be &s;ure, as ever broke bread. He never hit me a &s;troke in his life: we would have a <HI>word</HI> or <HI>two</HI> now and then, to be &s;ure, but that was nothing to nobody." She then related the hard&s;hips &s;he had undergone &s;ince her hu&s;band's death, which were confirmed by her meagre looks and thread-bare garment. Julia, who knew &s;he was a de&s;erving object, gave her &s;ome pre&s;ent relief, and promi&s;ed to allow her a weekly donation, which &s;he &s;hould receive from the per&s;on who took care of Mrs. Melbourn's country hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Without &s;topping, to hear the thanks and ble&s;&s;ings of her pen&s;ioner, Julia then ha&s;tened to join the party, which &s;he &s;aw walking at &s;ome di&s;tance on
<PB N="163" REF="164">
the banks of the river; but at this moment, pa&s;&s;ing a little cop&s;e, &s;he per|ceived Frederick Seymour coming through it to meet her. He came up to her in a few minutes. "Why did you leave the company, Mr. Sey|mour?" &s;aid Julia, in a tone of di&s;|plea&s;ure&mdash;"Becau&s;e I could not bear to remain with them, when you were ab&s;ent, and told them I would wait for you: you know my abhorrence of the whole group of females I have left be|hind." Julia made no reply, for &s;he was &s;o much vexed and agitated at his having left the party, for the declared purpo&s;e of waiting for her, that &s;he had no power to rally her oppre&s;&s;ed &s; pirits. "How," continued Seymour, "can any man who has the &s;malle&s;t ta&s;te for &s;im|plicity and nature, have plea&s;ure in the &s;ociety of &s;uch women as Mrs. Sey|mour and the Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s?&mdash;but <HI>this</HI> day, above all others, I find their
<PB N="164" REF="165">
company dete&s;table; and determined to &s;hake off the re&s;traint, at lea&s;t for a few ble&s;&s;ed moments." "I do not per|fectly under&s;tand," &s;aid Julia coldly, "why their &s;ociety &s;hould be &s;o much more oppre&s;&s;ive on this day, than any other." "Need I name the rea&s;on?" cried he pa&s;&s;ionately: "Oh it is a day to me the mo&s;t deci&s;ive of my life! it was on this very day I fir&s;t &s;aw you!&mdash;Yes, Julia, deare&s;t, mo&s;t perfect of women, &s;ince <HI>that</HI> hour"&mdash;"Is it generous, Mr. Seymour," interrupted Julia, "thus to per&s;ecute me? to re|duce me to the cruel alternative of for|&s;aking my uncle's hou&s;e, or being &s;ubject to di&s;cour&s;e which it &s;hocks, which it degrades me to hear." Her voice faltered, and tears fell down her cheeks&mdash;"Oh," exclaimed Seymour, "what have I done? if you could &s;ee the contrition of my &s;oul; if you could form an idea of my mi&s;ery&mdash;" "Speak
<PB N="165" REF="166">
to me no more, Sir," &s;aid Julia, "for Heaven's &s;ake let me endeavour to com|po&s;e my thoughts." "Try then to forgive me, or, if I am unworthy of pardon, think at lea&s;t of my wretched|ne&s;s with &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion!" Julia was &s;ilent, and Seymour, who &s;aw her turn very pale, feared to increa&s;e her agita|tion; and dur&s;t not tru&s;t him&s;elf to &s;peak. He bitterly lamented his indi&s;|cretion, only becau&s;e he &s;aw it had oc|ca&s;ioned &s;uch di&s;turbance to the mind of Julia; for, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, he was carele&s;s what comments might be made on his conduct. The heart of this unfortunate young man had reached that fatal paroxy&s;m of pa&s;&s;ion, when the opinions of the world become wholly indifferent; when the mind che|ri&s;hes its unhappy feelings; when it lives not to it&s;elf, but to another; when every object, but one, &s;inks into in&s;ig|nificance; when all amu&s;ement be|comes
<PB N="166" REF="167">
painful; all &s;ociety irk&s;ome; and the di&s;ea&s;ed heart can only endure the gloom of &s;olitude, in the ab&s;ence of that object to whom it was devoted; while every e&s;&s;ential good, every important con&s;ideration, all that &s;hould be dear and valuable, is &s;acrificed to a pa&s;&s;ion, the remor&s;ele&s;s tyranny of which has bla&s;ted in youth every blo&s;&s;om of hope, &s;ubdued every principle of fortitude, and conquered every effort of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>When Frederick Seymour and Julia joined the company, Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ex|claimed, "You look very grave, Mi&s;s Clifford, I &s;uppo&s;e your poor woman has told you a mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;tory." "Why yes," an&s;wered Julia, "it was a melan|choly narrative of feeblene&s;s and want." "That's the wor&s;t part of attending to the&s;e poor creatures," &s;aid Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">; "they always in&s;i&s;t upon telling one a &s;tory of hard&s;hips of a mile long. Its no great trouble to take a few &s;hillings out
<PB N="167" REF="168">
of one's pur&s;e, but a true and faithful account of their whole hi&s;tory, is a mon&s;trous <HI>bore</HI> to be &s;ure." Seymour gave her a look of indignation, and Ju|lia made no reply.</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed at Mrs. Melbourne's villa &s;omewhat heavily; which generally happens, when people &s;et out on what is called a party of plea&s;ure. There &s;eems to be &s;uch a perver&s;e &s;pirit in plea&s;ure, that, whenever we &s;end that capricious nymph a particular invita|tion, &s;he refu&s;es to &s;it down at the ban|quet. The form of preparation frightens her from the vacant &s;eat, and &s;he fan|cies "the table's full."</P>
<P>As it rained violently the greate&s;t part of the afternoon, the company looked at the country from the windows, walked from one room to another, and &s;eemed at a great lo&s;s how to get rid of the hours which remained before the carriages were ordered. Mr. Seymour, who per|formed
<PB N="168" REF="169">
the honours of the hou&s;e, &s;aw that he was expected to be gay and agreeable; but he was in no humour for either gaiety or agreeablene&s;s. He had not yet conquered the di&s;appointment of his hopes; and, though he pur&s;ued his &s;chemes of avarice and ambition as in|defatigably as ever, Mrs. Meynell's image &s;till floated in his imagination, and the certainty, that on the departure of her hu&s;band &s;he would immediately bani&s;h him from her &s;ight, di&s;turbed his repo&s;e. Incapable of real tenderne&s;s, his pa&s;&s;ion, which had only impelled him to the de&s;truction of its object, made him now &s;icken at the pro&s;pect of her happine&s;s; nor could his mind fur|ni&s;h him with any &s;oothing reflections to repel the force of di&s;appointment. He could recall no acts of benevolence or genero&s;ity; no feelings of philanthropy or friend&s;hip; none of tho&s;e kind and gentle offices, which, to a liberal and
<PB N="169" REF="170">
open heart are the deare&s;t occupations of life. Mr. Seymour was con&s;cious that his talents had never been employed for the benefit of any human creature, exclu&s;ively of his neare&s;t relations; and that his fortune had promoted no man's enjoyments but his own. He was con&s;cious of having intirely re|ver&s;ed that pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, which declares "that no man liveth to him|&s;elf," for he had lived to him&s;elf only. But it &s;eems to be the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that, when its crafty wi&s;|dom has over-reached the un&s;u&s;picious part of mankind, and its &s;chemes are &s;ucce&s;sful, it does but enjoy a tri|umph, which an hone&s;t and ingenuous mind would think far too dearly pur|cha&s;ed at the price of tho&s;e exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations which ari&s;e from the benevo|lent affections. And, when the views of the &s;elfi&s;h are di&s;appointed, they can|not fly for refuge to the bo&s;om of
<PB N="170" REF="171">
friend&s;hip. They have been too much occupied by every other intere&s;t, to cul|tivate an intere&s;t in any human heart; and are condemned to brood over &s;oli|tary &s;orrow. Mr. Seymour had indeed an affection for his brothers, which had led him to promote their advancement in life to the utmo&s;t of his ability: but even this &s;entiment was, in his brea&s;t, &s;trongly tinctured with ambition, with the idea of aggrandizing his own family, and had &s;omething extremely &s;elfi&s;h in its compo&s;ition. When an enlarged, and comprehen&s;ive mind, &s;uch as Mr. Seymour po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, capable of every no|ble exertion, and every liberal &s;enti|ment, employs its talents only to the narrow purpo&s;es of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, how in|adequate, how unworthy is the end to the means u&s;ed for its attainment!&mdash;It &s;eems as ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous, as that &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, which imagined the &s;un, the moon, and all tho&s;e in|numerable
<PB N="171" REF="172">
worlds which fill the im|men&s;ity of nature, were formed only to revolve round this little &s;peck in crea|tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour, di&s;contented with him|&s;elf, di&s;gu&s;ted with others, angry at be|ing obliged to appear plea&s;ed when he was in ill-humour, and to talk when he cho&s;e to remain &s;ilent, felt as if this everla&s;ting evening would never clo&s;e. His impatience was perceived by Mrs. Seymour, who, being in very good humour her&s;elf, Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> having &s;aid &s;ome agreeable things to her during dinner, kindly &s;aved her hu&s;band the ta&s;k of &s;upporting conver&s;ation any longer, by taking out her pocket-book, which was &s;tored with enigmas and charards. When the faculties of the company had been &s;ufficiently exer|ci&s;ed, Mrs. Seymour produced a &s;onnet, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he found on the carpet of her drawing-room, one evening the

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERICK Seymour, Charlotte, and Julia, &s;eemed by mutual con&s;ent to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of cheerfulne&s;s in Mr. Clifford's pre&s;ence. They all trembled at the idea of di&s;|turbing his peace, and extending the mi&s;ery which preyed upon their own minds, to the bo&s;om of their generous benefactor. Mr. Clifford was not apt to di&s;cern what others wi&s;hed to con|ceal: he therefore mi&s;took this imita|tion of happine&s;s for the reality, and exulted in having been the in&s;trument of di&s;pen&s;ing felicity to the objects of his deare&s;t affection, feeling it the mo&s;t precious u&s;e of fortune. He pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="178" REF="179">
his time in the exerci&s;e of piety and be|nevolence, and in the &s;ociety of his friends; enjoyed a rubber at whi&s;t every evening; and had no &s;ubject of anxiety except the affairs of the &s;tate. He felt, indeed, the mo&s;t watchful &s;olicitude to pre&s;erve the balance of power in Eu|rope, and was &s;ometimes in low &s;pirits on account of the national debt.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had lately been left the addition of ten thou&s;and pounds to her fortune, by the death of a rich old aunt, with whom &s;he was a favourite; and, a few weeks after &s;he came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her legacy, was married to Mr. Charles Seymour. This young man had begun the winter campaign by paying his addre&s;&s;es, in very rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to the daughters of a certain lord, a rich baronet, a na|bob, and two bankers in the city; but was repul&s;ed by the parents of tho&s;e young women, on account of not being
<PB N="179" REF="180">
able to make &s;ettlements adequate to their fortunes. Upon receiving the intelligence of Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s legacy, he determined, though a little tired of acting the part of a lover, to perform that character once more. Accord|ingly he paid his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, was favourably received, and in a &s;hort time married. This union was formed on the wi&s;e&s;t motives, con&s;idering the characters of both parties, notwith&s;tanding he di&s;liked his wife at the time of their marriage; and the feelings of the lady towads her hu&s;band, though they did not amount to di&s;like, calmly re&s;ted in indifference. But he knew that her fortune would be u&s;eful, and that her connections were honorable; and &s;he, with no le&s;s pene|tration, di&s;cerned that his income, join|ed to her own, would &s;upport her with elegance. She &s;aw that his conver&s;a|tion, and his &s;hoe-buckles, his man|ners, and his toupee, were all perfectly
<PB N="180" REF="181">
<HI>toni&s;h</HI>; gems of the fir&s;t water, in the regalia of fa&s;hion; and thought that, upon the whole, he was a hu&s;band that would do her credit. Be&s;ides, &s;he was now twenty-&s;even years of age, and had, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t ten years of her life, &s;uffered many di&s;appointments from being very apt to con&s;true the &s;lighte&s;t attention from any of the other &s;ex, into an oblique declaration of love. If a gentleman was gay in her compa|ny, it was with a wicked de&s;ign to win her heart; if he was grave, it was ow|ing to the embarra&s;&s;ment of pa&s;&s;ion. Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> fancied her&s;elf &s;killed in all the &s;ymptoms of love, and often en|tru&s;ted the &s;ecret of her conque&s;ts to her confidential friends, &s;omewhat pre|maturely; till at length, tired of mi&s;in|terpretation, &s;he determined to prevent &s;uch di&s;agreeable mi&s;takes in future, by marrying Mr. Charles Seymour, with|out farther lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">
With the&s;e &s;entiments of mutual convenience, encumbered with no feel|ings of reciprocal affection, confidence, or e&s;teem, Mr. Charles Seymour and Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> were united. Nor were their expectations deceived. They cer|tainly enjoyed no dome&s;tic &s;atisfaction, but thought <HI>that</HI> might well be di&s;pen&s;|ed with, as, in the crowd of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive engagements, it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible to find any time to be happy at home, even if they had felt the inclina|tion; and when &s;o many amu&s;ements courted their acceptance abroad, they had the moderation to think, that one &s;mall article of enjoyment ought not to be regretted. This congenial pair lived much apart; were very civil when they met; crouded a number of vi&s;its into each day; and partook of all the plea|&s;ure which di&s;&s;ipation can confer upon its votaries. It certainly was not a &s;pe|cies of plea&s;ure which an enlarged mind
<PB N="182" REF="183">
would pur&s;ue, or a feeling heart would reli&s;h; and occa&s;ionally it became &s;o very tire&s;ome, that, from the languor of their countenances, an uninformed &s;pectator might have mi&s;taken gaiety for pe|nance. They &s;ought for happine&s;s as laboriou&s;ly as an alchymi&s;t for the phi|lo&s;opher's &s;tone; but found, that, like that undi&s;covered trea&s;ure, happine&s;s was a hidden property, which mocked all the re&s;earches of the di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>Julia's perplexities and &s;orrows did not make her negligent of Mrs. Mey|nell's affairs; and, though &s;ome of the evils under which &s;he laboured were &s;uch as admitted of no remedy, Julia determined at lea&s;t to remove the mi|&s;eries of penury: a &s;ituation which ex|po&s;es a delicate mind to tho&s;e mortifi|cations, of which, however galling, it were abject to complain, and unavail|ing to demand &s;ympathy; &s;ince, though the world is liberal of its alms to po|verty,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
wealth has monopolized its re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford had, at Julia's &s;olicita|tion, procured for Capt. Meynell a profitable appointment in India; and, the moment the affair was &s;ettled, &s;he flew to Mrs. Meynell, and inform|ed her of the &s;ucce&s;s of the application. Mrs. Meynell attempted to &s;peak, but her voice faltered, and &s;he was unable to proceed. As the eye is oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;udden light after darkne&s;s, &s;o her heart was overpowered by &s;en&s;ations to which it had long been a &s;tranger, and &s;he bur&s;t into a violent fit of tears: but, how delicious are &s;uch feelings! Alas, the &s;ources of mi&s;ery, that give ri&s;e to tears, are many and various; but how &s;eldom do they proceed from the over|flowing tide of happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Julia acquainted Mrs. Meynell, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for Capt. Meynell to go to India in a few months, and
<PB N="184" REF="185">
invited her, in Mr. Clifford's name, to take up her re&s;idence in his family dur|ing the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band. Mrs. Meynell received the invitation with rapture. "To find an a&s;ylum," cried &s;he, in a voice frequently interrupted by tears, "to find an a&s;ylum beneath your roof, to enjoy your &s;ociety, is to me, of all plans, the mo&s;t &s;oothing. Oh, after having &s;o long contended with the world, after being &s;hocked by neglect, or obliged to combat with in|&s;olence, how will your gentlene&s;s heal every wound of my heart!&mdash;Is there indeed &s;uch happine&s;s re&s;erved for me? Can the period be near when my days &s;hall pa&s;s in tranquillity?&mdash;Alas, I ne|ver hoped to be at peace again!&mdash;I ex|pected to bear the load of mi&s;ery till I could no longer &s;upport its weight, and death came to my relief."&mdash;"Per|haps," added &s;he, "I have been cri|minal in the indulgence of de&s;ponden|cy;
<PB N="185" REF="186">
but I own to you, that I have long felt life a burden. I have been tempted to &s;ay to my&s;elf  "In the morning, Would to God it were evening! and in the evening, Would to God it were morning!"&mdash;but I &s;hall be happy again, and, what will endear that happi|ne&s;s, I &s;hall owe it to you!"</P>
<P>After an effu&s;ion of gratitude, which Julia in vain endeavoured to interrupt, Mrs. Meynell, in the fulne&s;s of her heart, mentioned the treatment &s;he had received from Mrs. Seymour. "While Mr. Seymour," &s;aid &s;he, "was paying his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Melbourne, &s;he courted my acquaintance, becau&s;e her intimacy with me brought them more frequently together. Yes, Mi&s;s Clif|ford, when I &s;tood in no need of her friend&s;hip, &s;he and Mrs. Melbourne were both profu&s;e of kindne&s;s, and lavi&s;h in profe&s;&s;ion. But as &s;oon as the period arrived, in which their friend&s;hip would
<PB N="186" REF="187">
have been u&s;eful; as &s;oon as they di&s;co|vered that I was left without &s;upport, and in a manner thrown upon their mercy for protection, they in&s;tantly changed the tone of their behaviour. To their friends my de&s;titute &s;ituation was recounted with an o&s;tentatious pa|rade of pity; and when left alone with them, I met with tho&s;e &s;light indigni|ties, tho&s;e petty in&s;ults, which are per|haps more difficult to bear than any other &s;pecies of mi&s;ery. They do not in|deed rend the heart &s;o deeply as &s;evere misfortunes, but tear and gnaw its &s;ur|face. Perhaps tho&s;e, who can thus heap wrongs on the unhappy, de&s;erve no|thing but contempt: yet, even while we de&s;pi&s;e the hand which inflicts the wound, we cannot avoid feeling pain from its &s;mart. Had Frederick Sey|mour been in England," added Mrs. Meynell, "I &s;hould have been &s;pared half the wretchedne&s;s I have &s;uffered.

He has a mind the mo&s;t noble, and ele|vared; he has a heart the mo&s;t gene|rous, and affectionate!"&mdash;"I believe &s;o," &s;aid Julia, faintly. "You an&s;wer but coldly," rejoined Mrs. Meynell; "&s;urely you know him well enough to have di&s;covered his merit. But I will hazard a re&s;lection to you, which I can &s;carcely bear to indulge. He appears to me not perfectly happy: there is &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e of depre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome lurking &s;orrow, that &s;eems to hang upon his mind, and affect his &s;pirits&mdash;Ah, Mi&s;s Clifford, you change colour! what do you know of this? is he not happy with your cou&s;in?" "Indeed you mi&s;|take," &s;aid Julia; "you&mdash;I believe&mdash;I mean, I am &s;ure Charlotte makes the be&s;t of wives. "I have no doubt of it," replied Mrs. Meynell, much a&s;toni&s;hed at Julia's embarra&s;&s;ment. "Her &s;weet|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;" &s;aid Julia, en|deavouring to &s;peak with compo&s;ure;
<PB N="188" REF="189">
but her voice faltered, and Mrs. Mey|nell, after waiting &s;ome time for the conclu&s;ion of the &s;entence, finding &s;he was unable to proceed, an&s;wered, with|out &s;eeming to ob&s;erve her confu&s;ion, "Yes, indeed, her di&s;po&s;ition &s;eems formed to con&s;titute dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and perhaps my anxiety for him has led me into an error."</P>
<P>At this moment Frederick Seymour entered the room. "I am come," &s;aid he, with eagerne&s;s, "from Mr. Clifford, to give you joy of Captain Meynell's appointment." "You are very good," an&s;wered Mrs. Meynell, "Mi&s;s Clif|ford has ju&s;t brought me tho&s;e happy tidings." "It was an office," rejoined Seymour, with warmth, "which &s;uits her perfectly." "Yes," replied Mrs. Meynell, "and I owe, not only the communication, but the event it&s;elf, to her goodne&s;s." "My dear Mrs. Mey|nell," &s;aid Julia, ri&s;ing, "how very
<PB N="189" REF="190">
&s;mall mu&s;t be the merit of any &s;ervices, which are attended with the plea&s;ure I feel at this moment!" She then de|parted, leaving Mrs. Meynell a &s;ubject of conjecture and alarm, in the confu|&s;ion &s;he had betrayed in their conver&s;a|tion re&s;pecting Seymour, which greatly di&s;turbed her mind, even amid&s;t the agreeable pro&s;pects which were ju&s;t opened to her&s;elf. Julia, however, &s;oon recovered the agitation &s;he felt from Seymour's &s;udden appearance, and left Mrs. Meynell's, exulting in the felicity &s;he had been enabled to confer. Bene|volence was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of Julia's &s;oul. To &s;acrifice her own gratifications to tho&s;e of others, to alleviate di&s;tre&s;s, and to diffu&s;e happine&s;s, were the mo&s;t delightful occupations of her mind: and &s;he had felt the &s;ame ardor of be|neficence in her former confined cir|cum&s;tances, though it could not pro|duce the &s;ame effects as in her pre&s;ent
<PB N="190" REF="191">
&s;tate of affluence. Charity re&s;embles the Spring, who&s;e benign influence, in a &s;canty &s;oil, can only wake a few &s;cat|tered blo&s;&s;oms; but in a more favoura|ble &s;ituation, &s;preads a profu&s;ion of beauty, and rejoices the heart of na|ture.</P>

<P>THAT unhappy pa&s;&s;ion which Frederick Seymour cheri&s;hed, gained every day a more fatal a&s;cend|ancy over his mind. To him every hour &s;eemed lo&s;t that was not &s;pent in Julia's &s;ociety; for life, in his e&s;timation, had no other value. The only ideas of plea&s;ure and pain in his mind, were her pre&s;ence, or her ab&s;ence: for when he &s;aw and conver&s;ed with her, he de&s;ired nothing more on earth; and when &s;he was ab&s;ent, he no longer felt any di&s;|tinction or choice of amu&s;ement or &s;o|ciety. All other objects were to him alike indifferent; and the mo&s;t agree|able company had as little power to
<PB N="192" REF="193">
give him entertainment, as the mo&s;t in|&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Mean time, Charlotte had too high an opinion of Julia's graces and accom|pli&s;hments, and thought too meanly of her own, to believe &s;he could ever regain the heart of Seymour. Every gleam of hope for&s;ook her bo&s;om: but &s;he had &s;ufficient command over her feelings to appear tranquil. She &s;huddered at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> thoughts of betraying, by her looks, that acute angui&s;h which had &s;unk into her &s;oul; nor did her countenance di&s;|cover tho&s;e marks of agitation which a lighter affliction would naturally have impre&s;&s;ed upon it. When a &s;torm fir&s;t ari&s;es, it throws de p lines of darkne&s;s amid&s;t the &s;truggling &s;un-beams; but when the gathered tempe&s;t has blotted out every ray, there is no longer any appearance of &s;hadow.</P>
<P>Charlotte had &s;ufficient fortitude to bear her mi&s;ery without complaint; but
<PB N="193" REF="194">
&s;he could not conquer her feelings, though &s;he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s them. She &s;ometimes received Julia with great coldne&s;s, and &s;ometimes, from an impul&s;e of jealou&s;y, was at pains to prevent her from being placed near Seymour. This he perceived with re&s;entment; and Julia, though &s;he thankfully &s;econded Charlotte's inten|tions, di&s;cerned them with angui&s;h.</P>
<P>One evening, when Charlotte had company, Julia, who&s;e &s;pirits were deeply depre&s;&s;ed, appeared uncommon|ly grave. Seymour thought &s;he looked ill, and wanted to place him&s;elf next her; but &s;he was &s;urrounded by ladies, and he could not accompli&s;h his de&s;ign; upon which he became impatient and tired, and when tea was over, went up to a young lady who was &s;itting next Julia, and, after much &s;olicitation, prevailed on her to play a le&s;&s;on on the piano forte. Charlotte well knew that Seymour had
<PB N="194" REF="195">
no fondne&s;s for any but &s;imple mu&s;ic; and that, when young ladies were called upon to exhibit their power of perform|ing what was difficult, he was ever rea|dy to exclaim, with Doctor John&s;on, "Would it had been impo&s;&s;ible!" Charlotte, therefore, could give little credit to this &s;udden change of ta&s;te; for her heart told her, that he only wanted a pretence to place him&s;elf next Julia, and her jealou&s;y prompted her, while he was attending the lady to the piano forte, to go and fill her vacant &s;eat. Alas, it is the peculiar cur&s;e of jealou&s;y, that its watchful &s;pirit is never lulled to repo&s;e! And the rea&s;on why "trifles, light as air, are, to the jealous, confirmation &s;trong as proofs of Holy Writ," is, that love in&s;tructs the heart to di&s;cern tho&s;e minute &s;hades of conduct which pa&s;s intirely unnoticed by others. It is often wounded by indifference. It is often &s;tung by unkindne&s;s, while they lurk
<PB N="195" REF="196">
under the u&s;ual forms of behaviour, and are altogether hidden from common ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Seymour, in a few moments, looked round, and &s;aw that the young lady's chair was occupied by Charlotte; who a&s;ked Julia &s;ome indifferent que&s;tions, in which &s;he clearly perceived that Charlotte's mind was not at all con|cerned, and di&s;covered that the move|ment &s;he had made was merely the effect of jealou&s;y. When the le&s;&s;on was fini&s;h|ed, the young lady &s;at down in another part of the room; and, Charlotte being obliged to move on the entrance of more company, Seymour placed him&s;elf by Julia, who determined to leave him the moment &s;he could do it without the ap|pearance of rudene&s;s. In the mean time, a gentleman was explaining to a circle at a little di&s;tance, a curious piece of me|chani&s;m he had ju&s;t &s;een; in doing which he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf particularly to Char|lotte,
<PB N="169" REF="197">
who &s;eemed attentive to what he &s;aid, but, in reality, knew not one &s;yllable of what was pa&s;&s;ing. She was li&s;tening at|tentively to Seymour, and heard a few indi&s;tinct words, which heightened her chagrin, as &s;he &s;aw that Seymour's &s;oul was ab&s;orbed in the conver&s;ation, and fancied that Julia heard him with plea|&s;ure. A gentleman who was placed next to Charlotte, afterwards tried to engage her in conver&s;ation; but though &s;he was obliged to li&s;ten, &s;he commanded her attention with infinite difficulty, her eyes often wandering involuntarily to that part of the room were Seymour and Julia were &s;itting. She tried indeed to &s;mile at &s;uch parts of the conver&s;ation in which &s;he was engaged, as &s;eemed to require it, while her heart was over|whelmed with de&s;pair. Her ab&s;ence of mind, however, was not remarked by this gentleman, who was a &s;olemn &s;ort of per&s;on, that &s;tudied his phra&s;es; came
<PB N="197" REF="198">
into company prepared to &s;ay what were called, by courte&s;y, <HI>good things,</HI> which he always accompanied with &s;ome action that di&s;played his large dia|mond ring; and had no conception that human attention could be diverted to any other object while he was &s;peak|ing.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of Seymour's conver&s;a|tion with Julia was, the de&s;cription of a &s;cene he had been contemplating in his ride that morning. This he de&s;cribed &s;trongly; and Julia, who delighted in every view of nature, could not hear him on &s;uch a &s;ubject with di&s;plea&s;ure; &s;eeing, however, Charlotte's eyes wan|dering towards them, the moment he cea&s;ed &s;peaking, &s;he ro&s;e and joined her party. Charlotte &s;poke to her very drily; and Julia was &s;o much hurt by this coldne&s;s, that tears &s;tarted into her eyes; and, as &s;oon as the carriage was an|nounced, &s;he hurried out of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="198" REF="199">
ready to exclaim, in the words of Shake&s;peare,<Q><L>Is all the coun&s;el that we two have &s;har'd,</L>
<L>The &s;i&s;ters vows, the hours that we have &s;pent,</L>
<L>When we have chid the ha&s;ty-footed time</L>
<L>For parting us&mdash;O, and is all forgot?</L></Q></P>
<P>More than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed and wretched, it was &s;ome hours that night, after Julia went to bed, before &s;he could compo&s;e her&s;elf to re&s;t; and, when at length &s;he fell a&s;leep, her imagination was di&s;turbed by dreams of horror. Sometimes &s;he fancied her&s;elf wander|ing among fearful precipices, that over|hung a deep aby&s;s of waters, which roll|ed black and turbulent beneath; while on the edge of the highe&s;t cliff &s;tood Charlotte, with her bo&s;om uncovered, and her hair di&s;hevelled by the winds! Her face had lo&s;t all its &s;weetne&s;s; her eyes had a look of frenzy; and darting a
<PB N="199" REF="200">
furious glance on Julia, &s;he accu&s;ed her of having brought her to di&s;trac|tion! Julia was going to reply, but &s;he &s;obbed violently, and the agitation of her mind awaked her. She fell a&s;leep again; and fancied &s;he &s;aw Seymour &s;tretched upon the floor; his eyes clo&s;ed, and his features di&s;torted by death. She called to Charlotte for help.&mdash;Charlotte appeared&mdash;her face was pale, her eyes were languid, and &s;he tottered as &s;he walked. When &s;he came near &s;he gazed on the lifele&s;s figure at her feet, with her hands cla&s;ped. In an agony of grief, &s;he knelt by the dead body, and ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and times: then turning mournfully to Julia, &s;he cried, "This is your doing, but I for|give you!" Julia &s;prang forward to embrace her, and awoke. She deter|mined to avoid a repetition of the&s;e gloomy vi&s;ions, and aro&s;e earlier than u&s;ual.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="201">
Mr. Clifford went out as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, and Julia, who was much indi&s;po&s;ed, gave orders to admit no company; but when her uncle re|turned, Frederick Seymour, whom he had met in the &s;treet, was with him. "I have bought &s;ome drawings for you, Julia," &s;aid Mr. Clifford, as he en|tered; "do, Seymour, &s;hew them to her, while I &s;peak to the per&s;on who is waiting in the hall; I &s;hall be back im|mediately." He then left the room. Julia turned pale at being left alone with Seymour. She was overwhelmed with the &s;en&s;ations of the pa&s;t evening, and the impre&s;&s;ion which the gloomy vi&s;ions of the night had left on her ima|gination: but &s;he endeavoured to a&s;|&s;ume, though not with much &s;ucce&s;s, an appearance of tranquillity; and forced her&s;elf to talk of the drawings. Her re|marks, however, were not very acute; and Seymour, though a connoi&s;&s;eur in
<PB N="201" REF="202">
drawing, di&s;played but a &s;mall &s;hare of critical judgment on this occa&s;ion. One of the drawings was Thom&s;on's Lavinia. Julia made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the picture; but Seymour now pre|&s;erved a gloomy &s;ilence, which &s;he dreaded would end in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation, and therefore continued &s;peaking, though &s;he found it no ea&s;y ta&s;k either to collect her ideas, or to ar|ticulate her words. "Thom&s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "is, of all poets, to me the mo&s;t &s;oothing; and when I feel any vexation, a few pages of the Sea&s;ons &s;erve to calm my mind immediately." "Poetry has no &s;uch effect on me," replied Sey|mour: "it only renders me more &s;u&s;|ceptible of mi&s;ery. Happy is the man who can imitate the wi&s;dom of Chartres, who &s;eeks for &s;olace in mathematics in&s;tead of belles lettres, and employs his under&s;tanding, while his feelings are at re&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
One of the engravings was the picture of Charlotte at Werter's tomb. Julia, on &s;eeing it, laid it ha&s;tily a&s;ide, and was go|ing to examine another print: "Do let me look at the tomb of Werter," &s;aid Seymour. "I think it is ill executed," replied Julia. "You will at lea&s;t allow that the &s;ubject is intere&s;ting," he re|joined. Julia was &s;ilent. "Are you of a different opinion?" &s;aid Seymour. "I think there can be but one opinion of that book," replied Julia: "every one mu&s;t acknowledge that it is well written, but few will ju&s;tify its princi|ples." "I am one of tho&s;e few," re|plied Seymour. "I am &s;orry for it," an&s;wered Julia; "but we will talk no more about it, for I do not wi&s;h to like it better." "But <HI>one</HI> word," &s;aid Sey|mour, "and I have done. People talk of the bad tendency of this book, and blame the author for blending virtue and vice in the &s;ame character, becau&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="204">
the example is dangerous. Does any per&s;on, when plea&s;ed with a book, im|mediately determine to imitate the hero of it in every particular? and has not the Author of our being blended virtue and vice in the great book of na|ture? Why does Werter intere&s;t us? Becau&s;e he is not a phoenix of romance, but has the feelings and infirmities of man. He is &s;ubject to the power of pa&s;|&s;ion&mdash;let tho&s;e who never felt its influ|ence, condemn him; tho&s;e who <HI>have</HI> felt its influence, too well know that it is ab&s;olute, that it is unconquerable. The heart that is bleeding with an incur|able wound, needs not the cold coun|&s;els of rea&s;on, to be informed that &s;uch feelings are painful, and ought to be &s;ubdued. It is already but too &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e truths; but it is al&s;o &s;en&s;ible, that its mi&s;ery is irretrieveable, that it mocks the vain efforts of pru|dence; and that, if peace depends upon indifference, it is a good which is unat|tainable,
<PB N="204" REF="205">
which can never"&mdash;"I mu&s;t interrupt you," &s;aid Julia, in a falter|ing voice, "for I cannot &s;tay any lon|ger." He did not attempt to detain her, but ro&s;e in great agitation to open the door, and &s;he hurried away. She met Mr. Clifford in the hall. "You have &s;tayed a long time, Sir," &s;he &s;aid, with &s;ome difficulty. "I could not di&s;|patch my bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ooner," he replied: "but you look very pale, Julia, are you well?" "Very well," &s;aid &s;he, in a voice &s;carcely audible, and then ha&s;tened to her room. "How cruel," thought &s;he, "is my &s;ituation! I make every effort to avoid him, yet am I continu|ally thrown in his way, and have no power to prevent it, without di&s;cover|ing to my uncle that fatal &s;ecret, which would for ever rob him of peace. What will become of me?&mdash;how &s;hall I act?&mdash;where &s;hall I fly?&mdash;alas, I &s;ee no end of my conflicts but in death! would

<P>Julia dined that day at Frederick Sey|mour's, with a large company, Mr. Clif|ford being engaged with a party of gen|tlemen. After dinner, Julia found her|&s;elf &s;o ill, that when the ladies return|ed to the drawing-room, &s;he told Char|lotte that &s;he had a bad head-ach, and begged &s;he would allow her to go home. Charlotte no longer felt any wi&s;h to detain her; for, though they were &s;till obliged to pa&s;s much of their time in each other's &s;ociety, re&s;traint, perplexity, and unea&s;ine&s;s, had taken place of the tender intercour&s;e of affec|tion.
<PB N="206" REF="207">
The&s;e fair friends were like two ro&s;es, which had once grown on the &s;ame &s;talk, but which &s;ome rude hand had torn a&s;under; and though their leaves were &s;till mixed together in <HI>one</HI> no&s;egay, the tie, that formerly united their &s;tems, was broken for ever.</P>
<P>Julia was anxious to depart before the gentlemen returned to the drawing-room, and &s;ent immediately for a chair; but, at the moment a &s;ervant came to tell her a chair was ready, the gentle|men entered the room. Seymour, with a degree of perturbation which he could ill conceal, came up to her, and enquir|ed where &s;he was going: "I have the head-ach," &s;he replied, "and am going home." "Let me hand you to your chair," &s;aid Seymour, following her out of the room. A few minutes after, a violent noi&s;e and confu&s;ion were heard in the hall. Charlotte rang the bell, but it was not an&s;wered, and, the noi&s;e
<PB N="207" REF="208">
&s;till increa&s;ing, &s;he went to the door, where &s;he heard a number of voices, and a great tumult. She ha&s;tened down &s;tairs, accompanied by &s;everal gentle|men, and found that one of Julia's chairmen had fallen near Frederick Sey|mour's door: the chair was broken, and the gla&s;&s;es were &s;hivered. When Char|lotte reached the hall, Seymour and the &s;ervants were taking Julia out of the chair: her forehead was cut with the broken gla&s;s, and bled violently. Char|lotte, as &s;he came towards her, ca&s;t a glance at Seymour, and, from the de|&s;pair vi&s;ible in his countenance, con|cluded that Julia was dying. She flew eagerly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while Seymour, in a voice of horror, uttered words the mo&s;t incoherent, and &s;eemed deprived of his rea&s;on: but, in the general alarm and confu&s;ion, the agonies of his mind were unob&s;erved by all but Charlotte; who, though much affected her&s;elf by Julia's
<PB N="208" REF="209">
&s;ituation, could not perceive Seymour's violent agitation without an emotion the mo&s;t painful. A &s;urgeon was &s;ent for, who &s;topped the bleeding, and found that the wound was but a &s;light one. Charlotte intreated her cou&s;in to remain all night at her hou&s;e; but Julia a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was well enough to re|turn home. Charlotte's carriage was immediately ordered, and, when it was ready, Frederick Seymour in&s;i&s;ted upon attending Julia home: in vain &s;he de|clared, that &s;he was quite recovered, and that his going was intirely unnece&s;&s;ary. Seymour per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, which Charlotte felt her&s;elf obliged to &s;econd; though that look of di&s;traction, and that voice of de&s;pair, to which the ac|cident gave ri&s;e, were &s;till pre&s;ent to her mind.</P>
<P>Julia, in the way home, remarked to Seymour, "that it was fortunate his &s;ervants &s;aw the accident, and came &s;o
<PB N="209" REF="210">
immediately to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance." "The only per&s;on who &s;aw the accident," re|plied Seymour, "was my&s;elf. I was looking after your chair, and when I &s;aw it fall, flew to the &s;pot, and called to the &s;ervants to follow." Julia, after this information, thought it prudent to &s;ay no more on the &s;ubject. Seymour was &s;till in too great perturbation of mind to tru&s;t him&s;elf to &s;peak; and they reached Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e without uttering another word.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of many worldly &s;chemes, which it would have required a length of years to accompli&s;h, Mrs. Melbourne was &s;eized with a dangerous di&s;order. Mrs. Seymour paid her a vi&s;it of half an hour every day; but the re|mainder of the day was &s;pent in &s;oli|tude, which afforded no very comforta|ble reflections to her mind, the oppor|tunities of doing good which &s;he had neglected, being the &s;ubjects of her fre|quent meditation. How different is the opinion which we cheri&s;h of our|&s;elves in the days of health, and when we feel the approaches of death! At the appearance of that king of terrors, the
<PB N="211" REF="212">
delu&s;ive mi&s;t which &s;elf-love throws around our vices and our weakne&s;&s;es, "melts into thin air," and the naked heart &s;hrinks from its own ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne now became &s;en&s;i|ble, that &s;he had not de&s;erved the ble&s;&s;|ings of friend&s;hip, and &s;he found her&s;elf left to die without its con&s;olations. De|&s;erted by every body, formal me&s;&s;ages to enquire how &s;he did, were all the marks of &s;ympathy &s;he received; for &s;he had no friend to pay her tho&s;e tender offices, tho&s;e minute attentions, which &s;mooth the bed of death, and which money cannot purcha&s;e of tho&s;e who are paid for their attendance on the dying. Her &s;ervants were more occupied by their own affairs than her &s;ufferings; and, being no longer able to exerci&s;e authority, &s;he was left entirely to their mercy. The per&s;on to whom &s;he was mo&s;t obliged was Julia, who, when &s;he
<PB N="212" REF="213">
found her de&s;olate and unhappy, vi&s;ited her every day, and admini&s;tered all the comfort her feeling heart could give.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melbourne left her daughter a con&s;iderable addition of fortune; and Mr. Seymour, who had long been weary of tho&s;e civilities which decency obliged him to pay to the mother of his wife, and who was eager to &s;eize on her property, heartily rejoiced in her death. Be&s;ides, it was one of his opi|nions, that no woman ought to &s;urvive the age of fifty; and he had often &s;e|cretly blamed Mrs. Melbourne for be|ing guilty of &s;o great an impropriety.</P>
<P>Charlotte's apprehen&s;ions that the heart of Seymour was wholly devoted to another, had received the mo&s;t cruel confirmation from his behaviour while he thought Julia's life in danger. Thrown entirely off his guard, by the &s;urprize and horror which the accident occa&s;ioned, he had di&s;played in tho&s;e
<PB N="213" REF="214">
moments, to the watchful eyes of Char|lotte, the uncontrouled agonies of af|flicted tenderne&s;s, the di&s;tracted &s;olici|tude of apprehen&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion. His voice, his look, his frantic movements, being all trea&s;ured in Charlotte's remem|brance, her coldne&s;s and re&s;traint to|wards Julia daily increa&s;ed, and gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the peace of that unfortunate young lady. To know &s;he was the cau&s;e of Charlotte's wretched|ne&s;s, to &s;ee her heart alienated, to read reproach and angui&s;h in her looks, which u&s;ed to beam with affection and delight, was a &s;pecies of mi&s;ery which the &s;en&s;ibility of Julia was unable to &s;u&s;tain. Her frame was naturally deli|cate; and the unea&s;ine&s;s of her mind at length produced &s;o great an alteration in her, that &s;he grew pale and thin, lo&s;t her appetite, and her health &s;en&s;ibly declined.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215">
Charlotte's heart was too hone&s;t, and affectionate, to ob&s;erve the&s;e &s;ymptoms of decay with unconcern. Julia never made the lea&s;t complaint, but Charlotte now di&s;cerned in her countenance the &s;adne&s;s of her mind. She was con|&s;cious &s;he had of late treated Julia with har&s;hne&s;s; and revolving in her mind every circum&s;tance of Julia's conduct, &s;he felt that &s;he had not merited this unkindne&s;s. She fancied &s;he &s;aw her &s;inking into the grave without complaint, and &s;truggling to conceal from every eye the angui&s;h that preyed upon her heart. The warm and generous bo&s;om of Charlotte was unable to &s;upport the&s;e reflections: her jealou&s;y was &s;of|tened; her &s;u&s;picions vani&s;hed: &s;he thought only of Julia's virtues, and &s;he felt that nothing was dearer to her than Julia's friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford and Julia coming to dine at Frederick Seymour's, Charlotte
<PB N="215" REF="216">
received her cou&s;in with the tenderne&s;s of former days. At dinner Julia &s;ent away her plate when &s;he had &s;carcely eaten a mor&s;el. Charlotte, who was watchful of her, and ob&s;erved it, tried to per&s;uade her to eat &s;omething more, which Julia declined. When the &s;ervants had left the room, "Indeed," &s;aid Charlotte, with eagerne&s;s, "I can bear this no longer&mdash;I am &s;ure Julia is very ill, though &s;he does not complain. Yes, my deare&s;t Julia," added &s;he, bur&s;t|ing into tears and &s;obbing, "my fir&s;t, my beloved friend, yes, you are ill, and I am mi&s;erable!" Julia, equally a&s;toni&s;hed and affected at this effu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s, had no power to make any reply. She pre&s;&s;ed Charlotte's hand in her's; while Mr. Clifford in&s;i&s;ted that a phy&s;ician might be &s;ent for immedi|ately. Julia made all the oppo&s;ition &s;he could, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inability of medicine "to mini&s;ter to a
<PB N="216" REF="217">
mind di&s;ea&s;ed;" but Mr. Clifford's fears were awakened, and he was not to be moved from his purpo&s;e. The phy|&s;ician was &s;ent for; but Julia found, in the returning tenderne&s;s of Charlotte, a cordial of more powerful efficacy than any which the art of medicine could ad|mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Seymour felt Charlotte endeared to him by the &s;olicitude &s;he di&s;played for Julia. He &s;aw his wife's excellence&mdash;was charmed with her generous affection, and endeavoured, by the mo&s;t tender and unremitting attention, to convince her how highly he e&s;teemed her virtues. Charlotte's open and ingenuous heart was &s;oothed by this conduct. She per|ceived that Seymour had the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to make her happy; and &s;he felt her former tenderne&s;s for Julia awaken|ed by the dread of lo&s;ing her. She could not endure the tormenting idea that her neglect or har&s;hne&s;s would
<PB N="217" REF="218">
perhaps &s;horten the life of Julia; of the dear companion of her childhood, the beloved friend of her youth, the con|&s;tant a&s;&s;ociate of her joys and &s;orrows. She behaved to her with her former kindne&s;s: Seymour carefully re&s;trained his feelings; Julia grew better, and they lived for &s;ome weeks in great cordiality and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> called at Mr. Clifford's one evening, and finding Charlotte and Julia &s;itting at work, he de&s;ired their permi&s;&s;ion to read to them a poem, written by a friend lately arrived from France, and who, for &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed of|fence again&s;t the &s;tate, had been immur|ed &s;everal years in the Ba&s;tille, but was at length liberated by the interference of a per&s;on in power.

<P>WHEN Charlotte's hour of dan|ger approached, &s;he intreated Julia to come and &s;tay at her hou&s;e during her confinement. Julia was gra|tified by this mark of confidence, but excu&s;ed her&s;elf from &s;taying in the hou&s;e; promi&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, to &s;pend with Charlotte the greate&s;t part of every day.</P>
<P>Charlotte being delivered of a &s;on, Seymour beheld his child with tran&s;port, and Mr. Clifford felt the birth of this infant a renewal of his own exi&s;tence. A few days after her lying-in, Charlotte was &s;eized with &s;ome degree of fever; and Julia, terrified at her danger, no
<PB N="225" REF="226">
longer he&s;itated to remain at the hou&s;e; where &s;he &s;carcely quitted her bed-&s;ide for a moment, and attended her with un|remitting care. In a few days the di&s;|order abated; and Julia was &s;itting in Charlotte's room, &s;oothed with the hope of her recovery, when &s;he received a me&s;&s;age, that a per&s;on below wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her. She went into the parlour, where &s;he found Frederick Seymour alone. He told her, that he had had, for &s;ome days pa&s;t, a very oppre&s;&s;ive pain in his head, and that he had that morn|ing felt him&s;elf &s;o much di&s;ordered, that he had made Charlotte's phy&s;ician feel his pul&s;e. "He &s;ays," added Sey|mour, "that I have a con&s;iderable de|gree of fever, and has ordered me to go to bed immediately. I am terrified at the thoughts of alarming Charlotte; but I find my&s;elf &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that I mu&s;t obey the doctor's direc|tions." Julia promi&s;ed &s;he would en|deavour
<PB N="226" REF="227">
to conceal his illne&s;s from Charlotte, at lea&s;t for that day, and then, in much anxiety, left the room.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician vi&s;ited Seymour again that evening, and found he was wor&s;e. The next day Julia, who could no longer evade Charlotte's enquiries, or find any pretext for his ab&s;ence, was obliged to inform her of his illne&s;s, which &s;he did in the mo&s;t cautious manner. Charlotte lamented her own confinement, and implored Julia to at|tend him, and &s;ee that no care was ne|glected. For &s;ome days his fever in|crea&s;ed. He believed him&s;elf in danger, and intreated Julia not to enter his room, telling her that he knew his di&s;|order was infectious, and that he trem|bled le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer from her attendance on him." Julia replied, "that &s;he was not afraid of the con&s;e|quences, and that her duty to Char|lotte"&mdash;

her heart grew full, and &s;he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next morning the phy&s;ician de|clared that his patient was better. Julia flew to give this joyful intelligence to Charlotte; who in&s;i&s;ted upon being car|ried into his room, notwith&s;tanding Ju|lia's repre&s;entations of the danger at|tending it, in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of weak|ne&s;s; but Charlotte would not be di&s;|&s;uaded, and was &s;upported into his room by her attendants. She threw her arms round his neck, and wept vio|lently. He was affected by her tender|ne&s;s, and p&egrave;rhaps not le&s;s &s;o from ob|&s;erving that Julia wept too. "We &s;hall be happy yet, my deare&s;t hu&s;band," &s;aid Charlotte, "and how &s;hall we ever be grateful enough to Julia, for her care of us both?" "She has been our guar|dian angel," replied Seymour, with emotion.&mdash;"Indeed," &s;aid Julia, "I mu&s;t now u&s;e my authority as head-nur&s;e,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
and in&s;i&s;t upon Charlotte's returning to her room; for I am convinced, this &s;cene has already been too long for either of my patients." Charlotte &s;till clung to Seymour in an agony of ten|derne&s;s, and was with difficulty prevail|ed on to return to her own apartment; which &s;he at length did, attended by Julia.</P>
<P>As the phy&s;ician had pronounced Seymour &s;o much better, Julia did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to vi&s;it him again until the evening. Perhaps, if &s;he had followed the dictates of her heart, &s;he would have gone &s;ooner; but &s;he was too virtuous to do more on this occa|&s;ion than duty required. When &s;he went to his bed-&s;ide in the evening, and enquired how he did, &s;he was &s;hocked by a remarkable change in the tone of his voice. His articulation was thick, and confu&s;ed, and he &s;poke with a quickne&s;s quite different from his u&s;ual
<PB N="229" REF="230">
manner. He told her that he was much better, but Julia doubted it from the way in which he told her &s;o. She waited anxiou&s;ly, when the phy&s;ician came, till he left his patient's room. "How is Mr. Seymour?" &s;aid &s;he, eagerly. "I am concerned," an&s;wered the phy&s;ician, "to tell you, that he is wor&s;e." "Good God!" &s;aid Julia, &s;tart|ing, "I apprehended this&mdash;his voice is changed." "It is" &s;aid the phy&s;ician, "and the fever has increa&s;ed mo&s;t rapid|ly&mdash;You look very pale, Mi&s;s Clifford, let me lead you to a chair." She bur&s;t into tears&mdash;"Oh, how &s;hall I tell Charlotte?" &s;he exclaimed. "I intreat you will not tell her, at pre&s;ent," &s;aid the phy&s;ician: "he mu&s;t be kept per|fectly quiet: this night will probably determine the i&s;&s;ue of his di&s;order." "This night!" &s;aid Julia, cla&s;ping her hands. "Do not tell Mrs. Seymour of this change in his di&s;order, till to|morrow."&mdash;
<PB N="230" REF="231">
"But if he &s;hould die to-night?"&mdash;"That is not probable," &s;aid the phy&s;ician. Mr. Clifford en|tered the room, and the phy&s;ician, after informing him of the unfavourable change in Seymour's di&s;order, advi&s;ed him earne&s;tly to conceal it from Char|lotte, at lea&s;t for &s;ome days, &s;ince, in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of weakne&s;s, it might produce the wor&s;t con&s;equences to her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Julia returned to Seymour's apartment, &s;he found him delirious. "Oh, you are come again!" exclaimed he with quickne&s;s&mdash;"I thought you were gone for ever&mdash;I dreamt you had for&s;aken me&mdash;left me to die alone!&mdash;I had a horrible dream!&mdash;my head burns while I think of it&mdash;Charlotte looked fiercely on me!&mdash;Charlotte will never pardon&mdash;&s;he was gentle once, but <HI>now!</HI>"&mdash;he gave a deep &s;igh&mdash;"Do not &s;peak, my
<PB N="231" REF="232">
dear Mr. Seymour;" &s;aid Julia, faint|ly.&mdash;"Dear!"&mdash;he repeated, in a low muttering tone&mdash;"Oh Julia! Ju|lia!&mdash;if I am dear&mdash;I charge you mark the &s;pot where I am buried!&mdash;mark where they lay me&mdash;never, never forget it!&mdash;and let it be your grave&mdash;it will be no crime, Julia!&mdash;Tell me if it will be a crime."&mdash;Julia left his bed-&s;ide to wipe away her tears.&mdash;"Where is &s;he? where is &s;he?" &s;aid Seymour, in a hurried manner, to the nur&s;e.&mdash;"Do you want Mi&s;s Clif|ford, Sir?" &s;he enquired.&mdash;"Mi&s;s Clifford," he repeated.&mdash;"She will be here, Sir, directly."&mdash;"Oh ble&s;s her! Merciful Heaven, ble&s;s her!&mdash;If I could pray, my la&s;t prayer &s;hould&mdash;But don't tell Charlotte&mdash;poor Char|lotte! no, no&mdash;I dare not pray for Charlotte!"</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford and Julia &s;at by his bed-&s;ide all night. He continued talking
<PB N="232" REF="233">
at intervals with the wilde&s;t incohe|rence; &s;ometimes raving of Julia, then fancying he was kneeling to Charlotte for pardon, and calling to his infant to plead for him. Mr. Clifford con&s;idered all he &s;aid as the inexplicable wander|ings of frenzy; but Julia, who well under&s;tood their force, li&s;tened to them with unutterable agony.</P>
<P>The next morning his pul&s;e grew much weaker, and a few hours before his death the delirium cea&s;ed. He call|ed Mr. Clifford to his bed-&s;ide, took hold of his hand, which he affectionate|ly pre&s;&s;ed, and thanked him fervently for all his pa&s;t goodne&s;s to him&mdash;He then enquired if Charlotte was inform|ed of his danger.&mdash;Mr. Clifford told him that the phy&s;ician had declared it would be ri&s;quing her life, to acquaint her with his &s;ituation. "Oh, no!" cried Seymour, "let her be &s;pared a &s;cene of parting&mdash;but tell her&mdash;&s;ince I
<PB N="233" REF="234">
&s;hall never &s;ee my wife and child again!&mdash;tell her, that my affection, my e&s;teem for her virtues."&mdash;His voice faltered, and he was unable to proceed. Mr. Clifford, in great emotion, left the room; and Seymour de&s;ired the nur&s;e to let Mi&s;s Clifford know he wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>When Julia came into the room, he begged &s;he would order the attendants to leave it. He then &s;aid, in a faint voice, "I have &s;olicited this la&s;t inter|view, my dear Mi&s;s Clifford, that I may obtain your forgivene&s;s, and may die in peace. Oh, Julia, forgive me all that is pa&s;t&mdash;pardon the unea&s;ine&s;s my conduct has given you&mdash;Oh, tell me, while I yet live to hear it, that you for|give me!&mdash;the atonement of my errors will &s;oon be made!&mdash;a few hours." His voice became choaked by his ri&s;ing emo|tion; and her hand, which he held in his, was bathed with his tears. She mixed her tears with his&mdash;&s;he a&s;&s;ured him, in
<PB N="234" REF="235">
broken accents, that her heart would ever cheri&s;h his memory with e&s;teem and regret. He then directed her where to find the key of his &s;crutore, telling her it contained &s;ome things which he wi&s;hed to re&s;tore to her&s;elf, that her feelings might not be wound|ed by tho&s;e memorials being expo&s;ed to other eyes. Julia unlocked his &s;cru|tore, and found her lo&s;t glove, toge|ther with &s;ome ver&s;es and notes, in her own hand-writing, which he had pre|&s;erved on that account. He de&s;ired to &s;ee tho&s;e trea&s;ures once more. He took them eagerly from her, pre&s;&s;ed them to his bo&s;om, his lips, and de|clared he would only have parted with them in death. Then growing fainter from the&s;e exertions, and &s;eeing her violently affected, he &s;aid, with much emotion, "Let not this &s;cene, I con|jure you, make too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on your feeling heart. Oh, if my re|membrance
<PB N="235" REF="236">
will embitter your peace, think of me no more!&mdash;Have I de&s;ired you to think of me no more?&mdash;alas, Julia, my heart a&s;&s;ents not to that re|que&s;t! Oh, no! my heart refu&s;es to be forgotten by you&mdash;let me be &s;ometimes recalled to your mind, and when the grave &s;hall hide me for ever from your &s;ight, think not of me with re&s;ent|ment." "Alas," &s;aid Julia, in a fal|tering voice, "is not the angui&s;h with which I am overwhelmed at this mo|ment, a proof that my re&s;entment is pa&s;t, and that all that remains is the bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow?" "I hope," &s;aid Seymour, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome mi|nutes, "I hope Charlotte will find comfort in your friend&s;hip. Poor Charlotte! I fear &s;he has of late been unhappy; <HI>&s;he,</HI> who is &s;o de&s;erving of felicity&mdash;Oh, it is fit I &s;hould die, who only lived to embitter the lives of tho&s;e to whom my &s;oul is mo&s;t de|voted&mdash;
<PB N="236" REF="237">
Comfort my poor Charlotte, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Clifford, and a&s;&s;ure her that my affection for her was active even in death." He now became &s;till fainter. "Oh," cried he, in a low in|di&s;tinct voice, "how often have I wi&s;hed to die in your pre&s;ence!&mdash;how often have I de&s;ired that you might be near me when I yielded my la&s;t breath; that your regret might &s;often my late&s;t moments&mdash;that you might be the la&s;t object my eyes beheld!&mdash;Oh, &s;peak to me, Julia, &s;peak, and let me hear your voice once more!" She tried to &s;peak, but &s;he had lo&s;t the power of ut|terance. She gave him her hand&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips&mdash;&s;he lifted up her eyes, and perceived he had fainted. She ro&s;e with &s;ome difficulty, and rang the bell for the attendants: he reco|vered from the fainting, but &s;oon after became &s;peechle&s;s. Mr. Clifford and Julia knelt by his bed-&s;ide, and he held
<PB N="237" REF="238">
her hand gra&s;ped in his.&mdash;Oh, is there any &s;orrow like that which we feel, when hanging over the bed of our dy|ing friend?&mdash;when we know there is no hope; when we are certain that a few minutes mu&s;t tear them from us for ever!&mdash;when we bathe their &s;tiffening hands with unavailing tears, and &s;ee them &s;uffering pains beyond the reach of human aid; and when, at la&s;t, we lift our eyes to Heaven, not in the ble&s;&s;ed hope of their recovery, but only to implore that the late&s;t &s;truggles may be alleviated, that their pangs may be &s;hort.</P>
<P>When Seymour's eyes were clo&s;ed, he &s;till continued to gra&s;p Julia's hand, and in a &s;hort time expired.</P>
<P>Such was the fate of this unfortunate young man, who fell the victim of that fatal pa&s;&s;ion, which he at fir&s;t unhap|pily indulged, and which he was at length unable to &s;ubdue. The conflicts
<PB N="238" REF="239">
of his mind, by in&s;en&s;ibly weakening his frame, gave greater power to his di&s;order, and thus probably &s;hortened the life they had embittered.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the talents, or the virtues, by which he was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, avoid &s;imilar wretchedne&s;s, by guarding their minds again&s;t the influ|ence of pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ince, if it be once &s;uf|fered to acquire an undue a&s;cendency over rea&s;on, we &s;hall in vain attempt to controul its power: we might as &s;oon arre&s;t the winds in their violence, or &s;top the torrent in its cour&s;e. It is too late to rear the mounds of defence when the impetuous flood rages in its &s;trength, and overthrows all oppo&s;ition. With a frame labouring under di&s;ea&s;e, we may recall, with regret, the bli&s;sful hours of health; but have no power to new &s;tring the nerves, or &s;hake off the malady that loads the &s;prings of life. Alas! the di&s;tempered heart, when it
<PB N="239" REF="240">
has &s;uffered the di&s;orders of pa&s;&s;ion to gain &s;trength, can find no bal&s;am in nature to heal their malignancy; no remedy but death. In vain we may la|ment the lo&s;s of our tranquillity; for peace, like the wandering dove, has for|&s;aken its habitation in the bo&s;om, and will return no more.</P>
<P>Julia, &s;o far as &s;he had indulged any &s;en&s;ibility to Seymour's attachment, was proportionably wretched. Women have even greater rea&s;on than men to fortify their hearts again&s;t tho&s;e &s;trong affections, which, when not regulated by di&s;cretion, plunge in aggravated mi|&s;ery that &s;ex, who, to u&s;e the words of an elegant and amiable writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. Gregory's Legacy to his Daugh|ters.</NOTE>, "can|not plunge into bu&s;ine&s;s, or di&s;&s;ipate them&s;elves in plea&s;ure and riot, as men too often do, when under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortunes; but mu&s;t bear their &s;or|rows
<PB N="240" REF="241">
in &s;ilence, unknown and unpitied; mu&s;t often put on a face of &s;erenity and chearfulne&s;s, when their hearts are torn with angui&s;h, or &s;inking in de&s;pair." Though a woman with rectitude of principle, will re&s;olutely combat tho&s;e feelings which her rea&s;on condemns; yet, if they have been &s;uffered to ac|quire force, the &s;truggle often proves too &s;evere for the delicacy of the fe|male frame; and, though rea&s;on, vir|tue, and piety, may &s;u&s;tain the con|flict with the heart, life is frequently the atonement of its weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Julia, when &s;he &s;aw that Seymour was dead, fixed her eyes on his corp&s;e: &s;he &s;huddered, &s;he groaned deeply, but uttered not a word. From this dread|ful &s;tupor &s;he was rou&s;ed by a me&s;&s;age from Charlotte, who &s;u&s;pected, from the anxiety vi&s;ible in the countenances of her attendants, that Seymour was wor&s;e; and Julia's looks confirmed all her appre|hen&s;ions.
<PB N="241" REF="242">
She enquired eagerly for her hu&s;band: Julia &s;poke, but her words were incoherent, and only half-pronounced. Charlotte, every moment more alarmed, became &s;o po&s;itive in her determination to be again carried into his apartment, that Julia was ob|liged to acknowledge that his fever was increa&s;ed; and when this only made Charlotte more earne&s;t in her de&s;ire to &s;ee him, Mr. Clifford was forced to give her the fatal information that Seymour was no more.</P>
<P>Charlotte lamented him with all the violence of unre&s;trained affliction, and a thou&s;and times reproached her fa|ther and Julia for having concealed his danger, and denied her the melancholy con&s;olation of attending him in his la&s;t moments. The &s;hock &s;he had &s;u&s;|tained long retarded her recovery; but at length &s;he regained her health, and found comfort in her infant, whom &s;he
<PB N="242" REF="243">
nur&s;ed her&s;elf, and in whom &s;he cen|tered all her hopes and affections. Af|ter &s;ome time, &s;he returned to her fa|ther's hou&s;e, where &s;he and Julia lived in the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mrs. Meynell, on the departure of her hu&s;band for India, was received in|to Mr. Clifford's family, where &s;he was treated with every mark of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s. Captain Meynell, a few years after, died in India; and the fortune he had acquired was tran&s;mitted to his wife, who &s;till continued to live in Mr. Clifford's family.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour, di&s;appointed in his de&s;igns on Mrs. Meynell, pur&s;ued other objects of plea&s;ure, and formed new &s;chemes of ambition; but neither am|bition, nor plea&s;ure, could confer feli|city on a mind which was harra&s;&s;ed by impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, and un&s;upported by con&s;cious integrity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seymour perceiving, in a few
<PB N="243" REF="244">
years, that the bloom of youth was fled, endeavoured to &s;upply the deficiency with an additional quantity of rouge; devoting more hours than formerly to the duties of the toilet, and pathetical|ly lamenting, in &s;ecret &s;oliloquies, the inhuman ravages of time.</P>
<P>Mr. Chartres, by his own diligence, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of powerful friends, was &s;oon enabled to &s;end con&s;iderable remittances to his mother; who re|moved to a hou&s;e, where the drawing|room held her card-tables with more convenience, and di&s;charged Thomas for a fa&s;hionable dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;pent mo&s;t of his time at Mr. Clifford's hou&s;e, remaining un|married, and preferring Julia's friend|&s;hip to an union with Mi&s;s Tomkins; who al&s;o continued &s;ingle, and &s;uffered the mo&s;t &s;evere mortification from the failure of her &s;chemes on Mr. F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. Still, however, &s;he continued to impo&s;e
<PB N="244" REF="245">
an artificial character upon the world; uniting, with the mi&s;erable triumphs of deceit, the comfortle&s;s &s;en&s;ations of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Charles Seymour lived together on the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable terms; too carele&s;s to regard decorum, and too indifferent to feel jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Mi&s;s C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> remained &s;in|gle, and, whenever &s;he heard of a &s;plen|did marriage, longed to forbid the banns.</P>
<P>The dying image of Seymour was long pre&s;ent to Julia's imagination, and the parting words he had uttered were engraven on her heart. When the all|&s;ubduing influence of time had &s;oothed her &s;orrows into greater tranquillity, &s;he found con&s;olation in the duties of religion, the exerci&s;e of benevolence, and the &s;ociety of per&s;ons of under|&s;tanding and merit. To &s;uch people her acquaintance was highly valuable,
<PB N="245" REF="246">
and &s;he lived admired, re&s;pected, and beloved. She refu&s;ed many honourable offers of marriage, and devoted much of her time to the improvement of Sey|mour's child, whom &s;he loved with the mo&s;t partial fondne&s;s. But the idea of its father &s;till continued, at times, to em|bitter the &s;atisfaction of her life; which, but for that one unconquered weakne&s;s, would have been, above the common lot, fortunate and happy.</P>
