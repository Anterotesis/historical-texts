<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
Treaty of Commerce
WITH
FRANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is in vain to make Complaints of
the Iniquity of the Times; and
make a long Introduction to blame
the People for the Humour that at
pre&s;ent, like a Contagion, infects the
Nation, and &s;preads it &s;elf Univer&s;ally
into all Conver&s;ation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of finding
Fault with, and Condemning every pub|lick
Tran&s;action, before they Weigh or
Con&s;ider the Rea&s;on and Nature of the
thing. It is enough to &s;it down and
look on it with regret, and with a ju&s;t
Pity for the Di&s;tempers of our Native
Country, apply &s;uitable Remedies for
the u&s;e of &s;uch as are not Incurable, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">
for the opening the Eyes of tho&s;e who
are not wilfully and re&s;olutely blind;
leaving the re&s;t, as the Pari&s;hes u&s;ed to
do Hou&s;es &s;hut up with the Plague, to
their own Fate, with <HI>Lord ha' Mercy and
a Cro&s;s</HI> &s;et upon the Door.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Commerce made with
<HI>France,</HI> is the pre&s;ent Subject of every
Man's Di&s;cour&s;e, and it were to be wi&s;h|ed
People came to the Reading it with
le&s;s re&s;olution to Di&s;like it beforehand
than they do, or at lea&s;t with a ju&s;t re&s;o|lution
to Read and Con&s;ider it, before
they pa&s;&s;ed their judgment for or again&s;t;
but &s;ince that cannot be hoped for in this
Age, it may not be a u&s;ele&s;s endeavour
to open the Eyes of &s;ome mi&s;guided mi&s;|taken
People, about &s;uch things in the
&s;aid Treaty, which they may either on
one &s;ide or other Cau&s;ele&s;ly Condemn,
or too ea&s;ily approve. That things being
&s;et in a true light, every Man may Rea|&s;on
with him&s;elf calmly of this matter;
for certainly a thing of this Con&s;equence
ought to be Duly weigh'd, and Cooly
Debated, before we come to make &s;uch
Conclu&s;ions as are to Determine our judg|ments,
both of the Treaty made, and of
tho&s;e that made it.</P>
<P>To Do this as it ought to be done, it
&s;eems needful to enquire a little into the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;tate of our Commerce with <HI>France</HI> be|fore
the War began, that People may a
little know upon what Foundation things
formerly &s;tood, and may accordingly
judge whether we are better or wor&s;e
than we were before.</P>
<P>We are told in the Treaty of a General
TARIF, that is, an Act of Trade
made in the Year 1664, by the <HI>French</HI>;
by this, &s;ome People under&s;tand a Treaty
of Commerce formerly made between
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> which is a general
mi&s;take, and which mi&s;take ought to be
&s;et right, the Words them&s;elves explain
it, <HI>a Tarif made in</HI> France, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the
Treaty) by which is to be under&s;tood,
a Table or Decree of the &s;everal Impo|&s;itions
and Prohibitions, made by the
King of <HI>France,</HI> for the Regulation
of his own Subjects, declaring what
Goods &s;hall be Imported into <HI>France,</HI> and
from what Countries, and what &s;hall
not be Imported, and what Cu&s;toms
or Duties &s;hall be paid in <HI>France</HI> upon
tho&s;e Goods which are allow'd to be Im|ported;
&s;omething like our act of Na|vigation,
allowing for the difference of
the Subject only.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dutch</HI> have entred into any
Treaty of Commerce with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> they
have grounded tho&s;e Treaties with re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">pect
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to their Liberty of Trading into <HI>France,</HI>
upon that Tarif of 1664, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
They have declared them&s;elves Content
with tho&s;e Conditions of Trade, and have
only Articled that they &s;hould not be o|therwi&s;e
ob&s;tructed; and therefore we
found that in all the Tran&s;actions at
<HI>&V;trecht,</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were In&s;i&s;ting
on the particulars of their Trade to <HI>France,</HI>
it was call'd, <HI>The</HI> French <HI>granting</HI> them
the Tarif of 1664, that is, <HI>granting</HI>
that no other Impo&s;itions or Prohibitions
&s;hould be laid upon them in <HI>France,</HI> than
that Act of Trade had formerly laid.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to this Notion, we never find
any of our former Treaties with <HI>France</HI>
make the lea&s;t mention of the&s;e things,
&s;ince admitting or not admitting the
Importation of Goods and Merchandizes
into a Kingdom, is the undoubted Pro|perty
and Right of the Sovereign Power
or Government of that Kingdom, much
more the determining what Duties, Pay|ments,
or Impo&s;itions, &s;hall be charged
upon the re&s;pective Goods brought in;
which Payments and Duties being paid
by the People of the &s;aid Nation who
Import, no other Nation can Object a|gain&s;t
them.</P>
<P>And therefore we find in all our for|mer
Treaties, nothing of this nature has
<PB N="7" REF="6">
been entred into at all: The fir&s;t Treaty
of Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
after the Re&s;toration, was the Treaty of
<HI>Breda, Anno</HI> 1667. wherein all that is
&s;aid of this matter, is in the Fourth Ar|ticle,
thus, <Q REND="inline">"Navigation and Commerce
&s;hall be Free between the Subjects of
both the Kings, as it was during the
Peace, in&s;omuch that all of them may
Freely, and without any Mole&s;tation.
go with their Goods into each others
Kingdoms, Provinces, Places of Com|merce,
Ports, Rivers, and there &s;tay
and Traffick." <BIBL><HI>Vide</HI> Treaty of <HI>Breda.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Feburary</HI> following, there was a
Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> con|cluded
at St. <HI>Germans on Lay,</HI> the late
Duke of <HI>Montague,</HI> being then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>France,</HI> and this is call'd
a Treaty of Commerce; yet from one
end to the other, there is not one Word
mention'd in it of the Duties paid or to
be paid in either Kingdom by the Mer|chants;
as what really was the peculiar
of every Prince or Sovereign Power
in their re&s;pective Dominions; and there|fore
tho' this Treaty is called a Treaty of
Commerce, it ought rather to have been
call'd a Treaty of Navigation, every Ar|ticle
therein re&s;pecting the Navigation of
Ships, Freedom of Ports, Vi&s;iting Ships,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
adju&s;titg what are, and what are not
Contraband Goods, Terminating Differ|ences
about Pa&s;sports, detaining Ve&s;&s;els,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> what Goods are liable to Forfeiture,
and how to be Seiz'd, and the like; but
not a Word about Tolls, Cu&s;toms, Du|ties,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon Importation.</P>
<P>The next Treaty, was that of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
where the <HI>Dutch</HI> were only immediately
concern'd, and a Treaty of Commerce
was likewi&s;e &s;ettled then, between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Holland, Anno</HI> 1678, but even in
this Treaty we have not a Word relating
to what Duties or Impo&s;its the <HI>French</HI>
&s;hould lay upon Goods Imported into
<HI>France,</HI> except as follows. <Q REND="inline">"Neither
Party &s;hall be permitted to grant to
their own Subjects any Immunities,
Benefits, Gratuitous Conce&s;&s;ions, or
any other Advantages, be&s;ides tho&s;e
granted to the Subjects of the other
Party, or to their prejudice, neither
&s;hall the Subjects on either &s;ide be
bound to pay greater or other Duties,
Charges, Payments, or Impo&s;tions
what&s;oever upon their Per&s;ons, Goods,
Wares, Ships, or Freights, directly, or
indirectly, by any Name, or under
any Title, or Pretence what&s;oever
other than &s;uch as &s;hall be paid by the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
proper and natural Subjects of either
Party." <P><BIBL>Vide Treaty of Commerce at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
Article 7.</BIBL></P></Q></P>
<P>The only Remedy, in all the&s;e Ca&s;es,
that has been u&s;ed by the&s;e &s;everal Na|tions,
has been, that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> laid high Duties upon the Goods im|ported,
or Ships Importing, from another,
or Prohibited the Importing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and
&s;uch Goods, or &s;top'd Trade with the o|ther,

and Interruptions of Commerce were
generally taken off, at the concluding a
Peace, tho' not always.</P>
<P>Thus when the <HI>French</HI> after their Ta|rif
of 1664, laid a Duty of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ty <HI>Sols
per</HI> Tun, upon all Shipping that came
into their Harbours, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
highly by all the Trading part of <HI>Europe,</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Sweedes</HI> were very unea&s;y
at it, their Ships being large and the
Loading &s;uch as Timber, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">boards,
Planks, Baulks, Spars, <HI>&amp;c</HI> being of
but little value, it went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the
Freight, but they were of too &s;mall
Con&s;quence to obtain any A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eration in
<HI>France.</HI> The de&s;ign of the <HI>French</HI> King be|ing
Really very ju&s;tifiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">
difference to encourage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to build Ships of their own, and fetch the
Goods them&s;elves, in which Ca&s;e they
went Free. The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ollicited eagerly
to be exempted from this Duty, the
Trade they had with <HI>France</HI> being very
great, and carried on wholly in their
own Shipping, but they were &s;o far from
obtaining an Exemption, that in the
Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a
&s;eparate Article, con&s;ented to pay that
Duty of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, as follows.
<Q REND="inline">'It hath been &s;tipulated on the behalf
of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and
con&s;ented to by the Lords the States-General
of the United Provinces of the
<HI>Low-Countries,</HI> That the Equality which
is preci&s;ely to be ob&s;erv'd with relation
to the Subjects of each, and the Natives,
as to Duties, Charges, and Impo&s;itions,
according to the Seventh Article of
Treaty of Commerce this Day con|cluded,
&s;hall not derogate from the
Impo&s;ition of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, Im|po&s;ed
in <HI>France</HI> upon Strangers Ships,
and that the Subjects of the Lords the
States-General of the United Provinces
of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> &s;hall be bound
to pay the &s;ame as other Strangers.' <P><BIBL>Vide Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> &s;eparate Ar|ticle</BIBL></P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were as much concern'd
in this Impo&s;ition of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, as
any Nation, the <HI>Dutch</HI> excepted; but
&s;eeing no ju&s;t Foundation to object again&s;t
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> laying
&s;uch an Impo&s;ition, and having by their
own Act, called, <HI>The Act of Navigation,</HI>
done almo&s;t the &s;ame thing, or in effect
wor&s;e, they contented them&s;elves with
laying a like Duty of 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Tun, upon
all <HI>French</HI> Ships which &s;hould Lade in the
&s;everal Ports of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o it has
re&s;ted till this time.</P>
<P>The next Treaty of Peace was at <HI>Ry&s;|wick,</HI>
and in this <HI>England</HI> made no Treaty
of Commerce at all; It was indeed Ver|bally
agreed, that Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould
be appointed to meet afterwards to enter
into a Treaty of Commerce, and to &s;ettle
the Trade between the two Nations;
But as <HI>France</HI> did not &s;eek it, and <HI>Eng|land</HI>
thought they had no occa&s;ion for it,
the War al&s;o being very quickly renew|ed,
that Propo&s;al vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Now to make way a little to the ex|plaining
the pre&s;ent Article of Commerce
in debate, it may not be ami&s;s to enquire
Why <HI>England</HI> was &s;o indifferent at the late
Treaty at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> whether they entred
into a Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI>
or no? And if this thing be rightly Under|&s;tood,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
it will open the Eyes of many, if
not of every con&s;idering Per&s;on, to the
Ju&s;tice, nay, to the Advantage to <HI>England,</HI>
by the pre&s;ent Article of the Treaty of
Commerce now made, which &s;o many
complain of, and &s;o few under&s;tand.</P>
<P>It is too well known, to need any De|bate,
that <HI>England</HI> had for many Years,
we may &s;ay Ages, carried on the Trade
with <HI>France,</HI> with manife&s;t di&s;advantages;
That by the prodigious quantity of Wines,
Brandies, Silks, Linnen, Paper, Gla&s;s,
and other Goods, which we greedlly
Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> the
Ballance of Trade went again&s;t us to a
very great yearly Sum; <HI>France</HI> having
u&s;ed many ways to encourage the In|du&s;try
of their own People in Woollen
Manufactures there, in order to le&s;&s;en, as
much as might be, the demand they
might make from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When the War interven'd, <HI>England</HI>
by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">veral Acts of Parliament, laid Ex|ce&s;&s;ive
high Duties upon &s;ome of the
Goods u&s;ually Imported from <HI>France,</HI> e|&s;pecially
Wine and Brandy, and others
were entirely prohibited to encourage
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to pur&s;ue with Succe&s;s the
Attempts they had made of &s;etting up the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as
Paper, Gla&s;s-Wares, Hats, Linnen,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Wrought Silks, and the like, the&s;e high
Duties and Prohibitions remain'd in Force
even when the War was at end; nor did
the re&s;toring of Commerce in general
Terms by the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> alter the
Ca&s;e at all.</P>
<P>It came immediately into Debate a|mong
the Men of Trade, Whether the
<HI>French</HI> Trade was worth &s;o much to us
as to make it worth while to open it at
the Expence of taking off tho&s;e high
Duties and Prohibitions or no? And it ap|peared
&s;o evident that it was ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to keep on the high Duties, as
well to encourage the Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI>
from whence all our Wines came in re|turn
for Woollen Manufactures; as al&s;o to
prevent the exce&s;&s;ive Flux of <HI>French</HI> Wine
and Brandy to the over-ballancing the
Trade to <HI>France,</HI> as al&s;o to &s;upport our
&s;everal Manufactures of Silk, Gla&s;s, Pa|per,
Wrought Linnen, Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
which we began to Improve, &s;o as to be
likely in time, not to want any or tho&s;e
Goods from <HI>France.</HI> I &s;ay this appeared
&s;o evident, that no Man c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uld think with
any Patience, of entring into any Treaty
of Commerce with <HI>France</HI>; but every one
was convinc'd, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to
keep on the high Duties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to give the
Advantage to the other Trades above
<PB N="14" REF="13">
named, and keep the <HI>French</HI> Trade under
foot.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e accounts it was that no
Treaty ever came to any head with <HI>France</HI>
(notwith&s;tanding Peace was made) for
the regulation of Commerce, and it was
apparent that <HI>England</HI> was in the right of
it at that time, for that in that Interval of
time, from the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> to the
Commencement of the la&s;t War, the
<HI>French</HI> bought exceeding Great Quantities
of Goods from us, while we on the con|trary
took but very few Goods of them
in Return, and the Ballance of Trade was
turn'd again&s;t <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This the <HI>French</HI> King was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of,
That to give his People the Equivalent,
he made a new Tarif or Settlement of
Duties and Cu&s;toms of Goods <HI>Anno</HI> 1699.
the &s;ame which is now mentioned in the
9th Article of the pre&s;ent Treaty, by
which &s;ome Goods he entirely Prohibit|ed
from <HI>England,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) Red Herrings,
which when &s;ome of his own Merchants
Petitioned again&s;t, he an&s;wered wi&s;ely,
<HI>Is not the Sea open? If my Subjects want
Herrings let them Catch them, not Buy
them of others.</HI> Upon other Goods from
<HI>England</HI> he laid higher Duties than be|fore,
e&s;pecially our Woollen Manufa|ctures,
&s;uppo&s;ing two things, (1.) That
<PB N="15" REF="14">
it would encourage his own People
to make them at Home; and (2.)
might lead the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to open the Trade
for <HI>French</HI> Wines and Brandies, in order
to make way for the Trade of the Wool|len
Manufactures again into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But this had no effect here; for the
Government here, who ea&s;ily fore&s;aw that
the Trade of our Woollen Manufactures
in <HI>France,</HI> was never equal to their Trade
of Wine and Brandy here, and that
the Channel of Trade was Happily
turn'd to our Advantage again&s;t <HI>France,</HI>
were far from enclining to alter it, and
thus the Notion of a Treaty of Com|merce
was &s;lighted as a thing <HI>France</HI>
might de&s;ire indeed, but we were better
without than with; And this was the
true Rea&s;on why it never came to a head.</P>
<P>Upon renewing the War, New Prohi|bitions
of Commerce on both &s;ides fol|low'd
of Cour&s;e, and to prevent the Wine
Trade falling in by private Methods, &s;uch
as Confi&s;cation, Prize-taking and the like,
under which Heads, while the Duties were
low, great quantities of <HI>French</HI> Wine was
dayly brought, a new Duty additional
to the former was lay'd upon Wine and
Brandy, particularly 25 <HI>per</HI> Ton upon
the Wine, and <HI>per</HI> Ton upon the
Brandy, which amounted to a meer Pro|hibition
<PB N="16" REF="15">
except for a very &s;mall quantity,
&s;o great an Advance of the Price reducing
the Con&s;umption to almo&s;t nothing; and
the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines, a very profitable
Trade to <HI>England,</HI> became our general
Draught all over <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true &s;tate of the Affair of
Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
and thus Her Maje&s;ty found things when
her Mini&s;ters came at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> to Treat of
the Settling a New Treaty of Commerce,
and from Hence it will appear that the
Mea&s;ures taken in the &s;aid Treaty, and
the Conditions agreed on relating to our
Manufactures in <HI>France,</HI> and their Wine
and Brandy in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and taking
off the Duty on either &s;ide, are not only
equal and ju&s;t, but are founded on the
True Intere&s;t of Trade, and much more
to the advantage of <HI>Britain</HI> than of <HI>France,</HI>
as will appear, if the following Particu|lars
are Impartially Con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Upon this New Treaty, after having
in General Agreed in the 6th Article, thus,
That <HI>the Subjects of each Party &s;hall Pay the
Tolls, Cu&s;toms and Duties of Import and Ex|port
through all the Dminions and Provinces
of either Party, as are Due and Accu&s;tomed:</HI>
That is, as the Government of that re&s;pe|ctive
Country &s;hall Exact or legally Im|po&s;e.
And again in the 5th Article, <Q REND="inline">'That
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Subjects of each of their Royal Maje&s;ties
may have Leave and Licence, to come
with their Ships, as al&s;o with the Mer|chandizes
and Goods on Board the &s;ame
(the Trade and Importation where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> are
not prohibited by the Laws of either
Kingdom) to the Lands, Countries, Ci|ties,
Ports, Places and Rivers of either
&s;ide.'</Q></P>
<P>This again allows that either Nation
may Make, and Continue &s;uch Prohibi|tions
of Trade as they think fit, without
any Infringement of the Peace. Indeed
the Nature of the Thing implies that
they &s;hould and ought to do &s;o; for every
Country is judge for them&s;elves, what it
is they ought to Admit, and what to
Prohibit.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of <HI>England</HI> then finding
the High Duties nece&s;&s;ary to be Continued
upon Wine and Brandy, at lea&s;t to a certain
Degree, as well to &s;upport the Appropria|tions
of tho&s;e Duties, as to prevent the
Ruin of our Trade; and al&s;o Con&s;idering
that tho&s;e Duties being laid by Parliament,
could not be taken off but by Parliament;
and that therefore the Plenipotentiaries
could not po&s;itively agree to take off
what their Principals had no Di&s;pen&s;ing
Power to Direct. Our &s;aid Mini&s;ters a|broad,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> could not therefore rea&s;onably
yield to the taking off tho&s;e Duties by an
ab&s;olute Conce&s;&s;ion: And as it could not be
expected on the other hand that the <HI>French</HI>
would, without &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion, take
off the Duties they had laid on our Goods,
and leave the Duties we had laid upon
theirs to be paid, there appeared but one
Expedient for &s;ettling this, which is con|tain'd
in the 9th Article (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
when the Parliament and Government of
<HI>England</HI> &s;hall agree to take off the high
Duties in <HI>England,</HI> then the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall
take off their Duties upon our Goods in
<HI>France:</HI> The Ballance of Equallity in
which is evedently given to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
in that the <HI>French</HI> are bound, and the
Choice is given to <HI>England,</HI> whether to
take off their Duties and open the Trade,
or let it remain as it is.</P>
<P>I can &s;ee no Objection that lies again&s;t
this Article, but what is founded upon
tho&s;e unrea&s;onable Peoples Notions, who
expect the <HI>French</HI> to give up all Condi|tions
of Trade to us, and that we at the
&s;ame time &s;hould ab&s;olutely tye up our
Trade from them; and &s;ince the Advan|tage
of the Trade as it now &s;tands lyes
manife&s;tly again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> the leaving
this Article to our own Choice, to Deli|berate
<PB N="19" REF="18">
upon and Determine as we &s;hall
find Cau&s;e, is a tacit pre&s;erving in our
own Hands tho&s;e Advantages as long as
we &s;hall think fit, which is a kind of
Advance made upon the <HI>French,</HI> that they
have very &s;eldome been found to admit;
and had any &s;uch Advantage been given
on our &s;ide, &s;ome People would have val|lued
them&s;elves very much upon taking
hold of it, again&s;t the Prudence or Fi|delity
of tho&s;e who Managed the Trea|ty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall return to this Head again, after
a brief Examination of &s;ome Clau&s;es in
Commerce which are &s;ettled by this Trea|ty,
particularly to the advantage of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade, and which no Treaty be|fore
this ever either obtain'd, or &s;o much
as offer'd at: Not that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> is &s;poken of
as a Ballance to any thing yielded up by
our Mini&s;ters, for it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s not appear that
any thing is &s;o yielded up, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that it is
expected tho&s;e who Compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">in in General
Terms &s;hould be An&s;wer'd and Silenc'd by
&s;uch Particulars; but it may be needful
to remind &s;ome People (more Rea&s;onable
than others,) how far the Intere&s;ts of the
Commerce of <HI>Britain</HI> are really &s;ecured
by this Treaty, and what Advantages in
Trade are obtain'd by this Treaty, which
<PB N="20" REF="19">
never were obtain'd before. <HI>For Exam|ple:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Impo&s;ition of 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton
is here expre&s;ly agreed to be quitted in
<HI>France</HI> to all Her Maje&s;ty's Ships: It is
true, we quit at the &s;ame time the 5 <HI>s.
per</HI> Ton on <HI>French</HI> Ships; but whoever
plea&s;es to Calculate the Number of Ships
Trading from each Kingdom re&s;pectively,
will allow there is no Compari&s;on to be
made; and tho' we contented our &s;elves,
as is noted before, with laying that Duty
of 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton upon <HI>French</HI> Shipping, as
a Return for their Tax of 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton,
it was becau&s;e it was a Duty of the
&s;ame kind with the other, rather than
that it was any way Proportion'd in the
Collection; and therefore when the
<HI>French</HI> take of their 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton, for
your 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton, they give you 20 <HI>s.</HI> for
every 1 <HI>s.</HI> you give them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Liberty of Importing Cured or
Salted Fi&s;h into <HI>France,</HI> is a Point in
Trade Gain'd m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rly by this Treaty, and
which as I noted before, after the Peace
at <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> was ab&s;olutely Prohibited in
<HI>France,</HI> and upon the be&s;t Rea&s;ons (turn|ing
the Tables, and making <HI>their</HI> &s;ide
<HI>our own</HI>) that could be imagined (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<PB N="21" REF="20">
to Encourage his own Subjects to Fi&s;h for
them&s;elves, which is many ways an Ad|vantage
to the <HI>French</HI> more than to other
Nations, e&s;pecially in the Breeding and
Encrea&s;ing their Seamen, a thing they &s;o
greatly want. This Trade by the 3d
Article of the Appendix to the Treaty is
to be admitted, being only referr'd to the
Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Commi&s;&s;ioners, whether it
&s;hall pay according to the Rule of the
Tarif of 1694, or of 1699.</P>
<P N="3">3. Liberty of Religion comes in as an
Addition to this Treaty, and which I do
not ob&s;erve to be mentioned in any of the
former Treaties, occa&s;ion'd, I &s;uppo&s;e,
by an Edict of the King of <HI>France,</HI> pa&s;t and
publi&s;hed in 1699. whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in no Merchant
Strangers were allow'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>France</HI>
without Conforming to the  Popi&s;h
Church; whereas now every Prote&s;tant
is at liberty to pur&s;ue the Dictates of his
own Con&s;cience, as by the 5th Article
thus: <Q REND="inline">"But in the Bu&s;inne&s;s of Religion,
there &s;hall be an entire Liberty allow'd
to the Subjects of each of the Confe|derates,
as al&s;o (if they are married,) to
their Wives and Children, neither
&s;hall they be compell'd to go to the
Churches, or be pre&s;ent at the Religi|ous
Wor&s;hip in any other Place: On
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the contrary they may, without any
kind of molle&s;tation, perform their
Religious Excerci&s;es after their own
way, altho' it be forbid by the Laws
of the Kingdom, Privately and within
their own Walls, and without the ad|mittance
of any other Per&s;ons what&s;o|ever."
<BIBL><HI>Vide the Treaty</HI> P. 10. <HI>Article</HI> 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I might enlarge on the ju&s;tice of this
Article, and the Con&s;equences, which o|mitting
it might have brought to this
Nation; but being principally engaged
here, in matters relating to Commerce,
I purpo&s;ely omit it for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Fourth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> for the
Freedom and Equality of Importing
<HI>Virginia</HI> Tobacco into <HI>France,</HI> &s;eems to
be very con&s;iderable, and e&s;pecially upon
two Accounts, or in two Ca&s;es, in which
<HI>England</HI> has been, and might be, under
e&s;pecial di&s;advantages in the Tobacco
Trade in <HI>France</HI>; which Trade, as it is
Improving in <HI>France,</HI> is of the la&s;t Con|&s;equence
to <HI>England</HI> to pre&s;erve, and if
po&s;&s;ible, to Improve it; that Trade being
at this time in the greate&s;t danger ima|ginable
of being utterly lo&s;t to this Na|tion,
as to that part of it e&s;pecially which
is Exported again to other Countries.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
The two Heads of this Article, relate
(1.) to the &s;elling it into <HI>France,</HI> to un|der&s;tand
which, more e&s;pecially it is to be
ob&s;erv'd that there is a certain &s;et of Men
who have engro&s;&s;ed, <HI>as we would call it
here,</HI> the Privilege, or obtain'd a Patent
from the King, <HI>to u&s;e our own Words again,</HI>
for the &s;ole Liberty of Importing Tobac|co.
Again by another Edict, no Stran|ger
can be allowed to Sell or Import any
Tobacco, but it mu&s;t be done by &s;uch
and &s;uch; &s;o that whoever brings any
Tobacco into <HI>France,</HI> is obliged to &s;ell
it to the&s;e Men, or have it &s;eized, and
give it to them for nothing which he
plea&s;es. Now this Monopoly is put to
an end, and the Subjects of the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> may Import and Sell their
own Tobacco to whom they plea&s;e, and
for the be&s;t price they can; and in one of
the Articles not yet adju&s;ted, it is de|manded
by our Amba&s;&s;adors, That the
letting out the Duties of Tobacco to
Farmers, &s;hall wholly cea&s;e. (2.) The
other Article relating to the Trade of
Tobacco, is, that <HI>Tobacco Imported into</HI>
France <HI>from</HI> England<HI>, &s;hall pay the &s;ame
Duties, and no other, as the Tobacco
of any Country in</HI> Europe <HI>or</HI> America<HI>, be|ing
brought into</HI> France<HI>, does, or &s;hall pay</HI>;
<PB N="24" REF="23">
this I mention, becau&s;e of the loud Com|plaints
that &s;ome People make of the
great probability, nay, certainty, that
after the Peace, <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> would
give and take reciprocally &s;uch Advan|tages
in Trade, to, and from each other,
as &s;hould be very much to the detriment
of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Advantage of
<HI>France</HI> in matters of Commerce. Now as
it is manife&s;t, that in the Article of To|bacco,
e&s;pecially Tobacco prepared, as for
Snuff, <HI>&amp;c. Spain</HI> has great quantities
brought Home yearly from <HI>America,</HI> and
that it would be much for the Advantage
of <HI>Spain</HI> to have the &s;ame Imported upon
ea&s;y and good terms into <HI>France</HI>; yet, that
by this Treaty, <HI>France</HI> obliges her &s;elf to
give neither <HI>Spain</HI> or any other Nation
any advantage over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the
Trade of Tobacco.</P>
<P>Nor is this an Incon&s;iderable Article,
<HI>France</HI> being lately come into the Cu&s;tom
of Smoaking Tobacco, and which <HI>England</HI>
can &s;upply, (placing the Goodne&s;s again&s;t
the Price,) Cheaper and Better than any
Nation in the World, al&s;o the Encroach|ments
upon the <HI>Virginia</HI> Trade which have
happen'd in the&s;e few years, being con|&s;idred
together with the di&s;couragements
which the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants have of
<PB N="25" REF="24">
late met with, this <HI>Article</HI> is of very great
Con&s;equence to them, and may help
to &s;ave that &s;inking Trade from final Ruin,
till &s;ome other Methods may be found out
which may re&s;tore and revive it &s;ome o|ther
way.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t of the Articles of this
Treaty as they are the &s;ame <HI>Mutalis Mu|tandis,</HI>
with the other Treaties of the
&s;ame kind, either made by <HI>England</HI> or by
other Nations with the <HI>French,</HI> there
needs no other Remark to be made, nor
can any Objection lye again&s;t them, the
u&s;ual Forms being Calculated for the Secu|rity
of Commerce and Navigation. I
&s;hall therefore return to the &s;aid Ninth
Article, in which all that can rea&s;onably
be objected again&s;t in the whole Treaty
&s;eems to be contain'd; and here it may be
enquir'd what the real Objections, that
our People pretend to make are, and to
what they tend; for, till this is known, it
will be very difficult to know what part
of it wants explanation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which I meet with, is,
That our high Duties and Impo&s;itions as
well as Prohibitions, upon the Growth
and Manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> are demanded
to be taken off, and tho&s;e Duties reduc'd
to an equality with the Duties on the like
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Goods brought into <HI>Great Britain</HI> from
other Parts.</P>
<P>This, it is alledged, cannot be done,
(1.) Becau&s;e it is expre&s;ly &s;tipulated a|gain&s;t
in our Treaty with <HI>Portugal.</HI>
(2.) Becau&s;e it would Ruin our Wine
Trade to other Countries. (3.) Becau&s;e
it would over-run our whole Trade, and
turn the ballance again&s;t us again, as it was
before in favour of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hort An&s;wer to this without any
Circumlocutions, is, <HI>Then, can't you re|fu&s;e
it and not take tho&s;e Duties off?</HI> But
then &s;ay Objectors, You cannot have the
free Export of your Manufactures into
<HI>France</HI>; to which the An&s;wer is al&s;o
direct, you mu&s;t do without that too. And
what then? <HI>Why then,</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. You will have as free an Export as
you had before the War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You had better be without that
free Export, if the equivalent which
you are to give for it would Ruin your
Trade. But let us enquire into the thing:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, <HI>You will have as free an Export
as what you had before the War</HI>; this has
&s;ome things in it which would a little
reflect upon the Prudence and Judgment
<PB N="27" REF="26">
of &s;ome People, and for that Rea&s;on I
&s;hall mention them very cautiou&s;ly;
(1.) You will have the &s;ame Liberty of
Trade, which you had after the Treaty
of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> and which then was not com|plain'd
of at all. (2.) If as &s;ome alledge,
the <HI>French</HI> are &s;o fallen upon making the
Woollen Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> that
they are in a Condition to &s;upply <HI>Spain,</HI>
What need have we to in&s;i&s;t &s;o much, and
at &s;o great a Price, upon the Liberty of
&s;ending our Manufactures to them who
can have no occa&s;ion for them, being
able to &s;upply them&s;elves and other Na|tions
al&s;o? But to pur&s;ue this Argument
would &s;eem Inviduous, this Paper has no
&s;uch De&s;ign, the pre&s;ent Argument ex|tends
thus far only; The State of the
Ca&s;e between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
Trade is &s;uch, That no other Conclu&s;ion
could po&s;&s;ibly be made, in the particular
Article of the re&s;pective Duties. Our
Mini&s;ters, if they had been willing,
could not have conceded the high Duties
(laid here) to the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e they
could not repeal Acts of Parliament. Some
of the Prohibitions laid on <HI>French</HI> Goods
are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the encouraging the like
Manufactures here, that it could by no
means be thought of; at lea&s;t, till it was
<PB N="28" REF="27">
laid before the Parliament, by whom
the&s;e Encouragements and Acts of Par|liament
were Granted and Made. On
the other Hand, How could it be asked
of any Nation to open their Doors to our
Trade, and agree that we &s;hould &s;hut our
Doors again&s;t theirs? And yet, even in
that Ca&s;e, the Treaty, as it &s;tands, has, <HI>as is
&s;aid above,</HI> actually done &s;o in &s;ome Particu|lars;
for whereas not the lea&s;t Farthing is
abated by the Treaty on our &s;ide, the <HI>French</HI>
in the &s;everal Articles mentioned before,
have actually receeded from &s;everal things
on their &s;ide, as the Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton
upon Ships; the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nopoly of Tobacco;
the admitting Fi&s;h in Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rels, that is, <HI>Her|ring</HI>
and <HI>Salmon,</HI> which they had prohi|bited
before? All this is done on their
Side without the lea&s;t Conce&s;&s;ion on our
Side; but all that is offered on our Side,
is left to the Parliament to determine,
whether they will come into it or no.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Equivalent, which you are
to grant in Lieu of the <HI>French</HI> Trade be
too great, if it be ruinous to our Trade,
we had better be without it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
Upon this Foundation, no que&s;tion the
Plenipotentiaries of her Maje&s;ty acted;
for fir&s;t obliging the <HI>French</HI> to &s;tand to it
on their part, they left it entirely to the
Determination of the Parliament, to
whom it would certainly occur, what
the value was they Exchanged, as well
on one Side as the other: If it be true
that the <HI>French</HI> have Wooll &s;ufficient for
their own Manufacturing, and both can
and do Manufacture &s;ufficient, not only
to &s;upply their own Dominions, Collo|nies
and Plantations, but al&s;o to Export
to other Nations, then it mu&s;t certainly
be of no great U&s;e to us to open a Trade
with them at all, becau&s;e there is no
Advantage to us in it, they having little
or no occa&s;ion for the Manufactures
which we think to &s;upply them with.</P>
<P>On the other hand, If it be true that
the <HI>French</HI> upon taking off their new Du|ties,
revoking and repealing their Edicts
and Tarifs, will nece&s;&s;arily take off a
great quantity of our Manufactures; then
it cannot be true, as has been &s;o warmly
&s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ame Writers, That the
<HI>French</HI> have go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">en the Manufacture into
their own Hands, and will not only &s;up|ply
them&s;elves, but other Nations al&s;o.
On the other hand, <HI>France</HI> is a Country
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of a va&s;t Extent, full of People, and if
they take our Manufactures for their own
U&s;e, will take &s;o great a quantity as we
can hardly Buy &s;uch an Advantage too
Dear, and the reducing the Duties of
their Goods here; e&s;pecially as it is
mention'd in the Ninth Article of the
Treaty, may, or may not be a thing of
great Extent to them and to us too, as we
do or do not rightly manage it. For ex|ample:</P>
<P>What is it they ask of us? I &s;ee but two
things that are material in their Demand.
They ask (1.) That we &s;hould Repeal all
our Prohibitions. And (2.) Reduce our
Additional Cu&s;toms, which have been laid
upon their Goods &s;ince the Year 1664.
and they offer to do the like. Well &s;ays
our Merchants, What then mu&s;t the
Cu&s;toms of Wines and Brandies be no
more than in the Year 1664. that will
bring Claret down to the Price of Six
Pound, to Eight Pound a Hog&s;hhead
again, and the common Tavern Price
to One Shilling <HI>per</HI> Quart, and what then
will become of our <HI>Spaini&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI>
Wine Trade? The Article an&s;wers for
it &s;elf in this Ca&s;e, the mi&s;take is in the
Reader, not in the Expre&s;&s;ion; for in
truth, there is nothing at all of &s;uch a
<PB N="31" REF="30">
reduction; but on the contrary, the
<HI>French</HI> are oblig'd to &s;ubmit to whatever
Duties we think fit to lay upon the Wine
and Brandy, as will appear more parti|culary
in the next Head: For the <HI>French</HI>
are wi&s;ely brought down to con&s;ent to this
Propo&s;al, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Wine &s;hould
pay as much as the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, only
we join to admit, that it &s;hall pay no
more, and yet the Complaint of our
People, again&s;t this Clau&s;e, is, <HI>&s;o loud,</HI>
that the old Proportion of things can be
ill heard, and &s;ome People conlude, that
this equality will ruin the Trade of <HI>Eng|land:</HI>
For, <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> The Inclination of
our People to <HI>French</HI> Wine is &s;uch, that
if it be at the &s;ame price with the <HI>Portu|gal</HI>
Wine, none will Drink the latter; and
therefore it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that
the <HI>French</HI> Wine &s;hould be laid under the
di&s;advantage in their payment of Cu&s;toms,
that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines may &s;till be
made the <HI>Common Draught,</HI> as it is called
through the Nation.</P>
<P>To this there lies two Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ections.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be true that upon opening the
<HI>French</HI> Trade as above, they will nece&s;&s;a|rily
take our Manufactures in Return for
their Wines, then we have the &s;ame Ad|vantage
<PB N="32" REF="31">
in both Trades, and ought to En|courage
one as well as the other, and the
Rea&s;on is ju&s;t that the Duties &s;hould be
alike, and the Encouragements or Di&s;ad|vantages
equal; if it be not &s;o, then it
alters the Ca&s;e: But then &s;ome other Ob|jections
will be ill maintain'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>That the</HI> French <HI>have rejected our Trade to
&s;et up the Manufactures among them&s;elves,
and plac'd high Duties on all our Goods,
without which they would be out-done, and
their own Manufactures Di&s;couraged.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade always paid
a le&s;s Duty than the <HI>French,</HI> is a great
mi&s;take, and con&s;equently it is a mi&s;take,
That it they are reduced to an Equality,
the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade will be ruin'd; for it
is apparent that from the Re&s;toration to
the Revolution, being Twenty eight
years, and the Reign of two Kings, the
<HI>French</HI> Wines were always Charg'd at
above 6. 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton le&s;s Cu&s;tome
than the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Wines, which always
paid <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine Duties, and yet the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had a very con&s;iderable Trade
with us for Wine, and very far it was
from being lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
Again, We do not &s;ee that this De|mand
of the <HI>French</HI> will help their Bran|dy
Trade at all: For all they Demand is
that their Brandy &s;hall pay no more Du|ties
than the Brandy of other Nations, it
is but pa&s;&s;ing an Act then that the Brandy
from <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> or any other Nation, &s;hall
pay as much as the <HI>French</HI> pay now, and
the Brandy Trade &s;tands ju&s;t where it was:
This is &s;o ea&s;ie to do, and of &s;o little Con|&s;equence
to us, that it cannot be Di&s;pu|ted:
For all the Brandy that we Import
from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;o little, and &s;o
ordinary, that it matters not to us whe|ther
we Import any of it or no; and
what-ever then is wanting in the Import
of Brandy by rea&s;on of the high Duty,
will be made up in Malt and Mela&s;&s;es
Spirits, and &s;o the Treaty of Commerce,
may be a means to pre&s;erve the Di&s;tilling
Trade to us, which every one owns is of
the Greate&s;t Con&s;equence, and which
can be &s;upported, humanly &s;peaking, no
other way.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries fore|&s;aw
this, they acted very wi&s;ely when
they brought the <HI>French</HI> to yield up that
Point, and not ab&s;olutely Determine the
reducing the Duties to what they were
before the fir&s;t War, which would have
<PB N="34" REF="33">
been very injurious to our Trade; if
they did not for&s;ee it, the good Luck is
greater than the good Meaning; and it is
to be hoped the Commi&s;&s;ioners who are
to Treat &s;till of farther Regulations, will
take care to make this Article of the
Brandy effectual.</P>
<P>In this could we be Impartial in our
Judgment of things, we might &s;ee that
this Treaty of Commerce is made with
&s;everal advantageous Clau&s;es again&s;t the
<HI>French</HI> Trade, which none that ever pa&s;t
before Contain'd, and in this particular it
is remarkably advantageous, That the
<HI>French</HI> are bound to take off all the Duties,
Cu&s;toms, Tarifs, Edicts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ince 1664.
as by the Article; but we are only obli|ged
to provide by a Law that their
Goods pay no more than the Goods of
other Nations: So that if we plea&s;e to
Charge the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Brandy, the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Reds, <HI>Malaga</HI> Whites, <HI>Florence, Galitia,</HI>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> at 100 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton, the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t
pay the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I would not be found putting a wrong
Con&s;truction upon the Treaty, and con|&s;equently
upon the Treaters; but I leave
every Man to make his judgment from
the Words of the 9th Article, which run
thus:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
<Q REND="inline">'It is farther Enacted, That within
the &s;pace of two Months after, a Law
&s;hall be made in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where|by
it &s;hall be &s;ufficiently provided, That

and that all Laws made in <HI>Great|Britain</HI>
&s;ince the year 1664. for Prohi|biting
the Importation of any Goods
and Merchandizes coming from <HI>France,</HI>
which were not Prohibited before that

<P>It &s;eems plain here as Words can ex|pre&s;s
it, 1. That we are only to make a
Law or Act of Parliament, to reduce the
Duty of <HI>French</HI> Wines, and the Duty of
all other Country Wines, to the &s;ame
Rate, the like of Brandies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. That
<PB N="36" REF="35">
upon our doing this, upon our pa&s;&s;ing
this Law, or within two Months after it,
the <HI>French</HI> are obliged to admit our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Goods upon the Foot of the Tarif of
1664. and to Repeal all the Additions of
Taxes. Cu&s;toms or Duties What&s;oever
which have been laid &s;ince that time, to
the Rate they were at before.</P>
<P>I believe this part of the Article has not
been Con&s;idered as it might have been
by mo&s;t People, and if it had, perhaps &s;o
many would not blindfold have Con|demn'd
the Article <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Ruinous and De|&s;truct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">
 to our Trade, even before they
enquired into the particulars: But as I
hope the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;takes of this kind are not &s;o
many or &s;o great, but that they may be
ea&s;ily rectified, and the People will be
forward to own them&s;elves in the wrong,
when they &s;ee plainly that the Advantage
is on our &s;ide. The&s;e Con&s;iderations
obliges me rather to endeavour to con|vince
the Per&s;ons of their Error, than to
refle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon their Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Treaty, like
other things of &s;o nice a nature, gives
many People unea&s;ine&s;s at fir&s;t &s;ight,
for want of rightly under&s;tanding the
intent and meaning of it, and to others,
for want of Con&s;idering rightly what they
<PB N="37" REF="36">
do under&s;tand of it: The Conditions of
it are evidently to the Advantage of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce in the main; perhaps
&s;ome part of Trade, &s;ome particular
Per&s;ons and Intere&s;ts in Trade may be
touch'd, may be &s;hortned in their pre|&s;ent
Advantages and future Pro&s;pects;
but as to the Intere&s;t of Trade in Ge|neral,
I think it ea&s;ie to make out,
that the Commi&s;&s;ioners who are to meet
to Regulate Duties. Remove Difficulties,
and State the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="7+ letters">ons and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">ences of Things, may &s;o order it, that the
General Intere&s;t of Trade in <HI>Britain</HI>
&s;hall be bettered very much by the
Treaty: And tho' it is reported, and is
not doubted but Endeavours are now
u&s;ing, and will be u&s;ed to procure Cla|mouring
Petitions from the &s;everal Ma|nufacturers
and Labouring Poor, as
well in the Trade of Silk as Wooll,
yet I am per&s;waded Time will &s;hew
them that the fir&s;t will be little in|jur'd,
and the la&s;t greatly better'd by
this Treaty, e&s;pece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">lly if the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
who &s;hall be Entru&s;ted with
the Management of it under&s;tand their
Duty, and act their Part with Courage
and Fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
And that we may a little open the
Eyes of the Commons about this mat|ter,
for they &s;eem to be the mo&s;t affect|ed
with the Danger from it; a Word or
two may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay to them:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for the Woollen Manufacturers:
It has been for many Years the Com|plaint,
That the <HI>French</HI> have Prohibited
our Woollen Manufacture; That they
have put a &s;top to our Trade; That
the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a great Trade to <HI>France,</HI>
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> who make pro|digious
quantities of our kinds of Ma|nufactures,
&s;end them into <HI>France,</HI> and
ours are Prohibited, and the like: The
Government having now made an E&s;&s;ay
to Remedy this Evil, and to open a
Trade for our Manufactures, We &s;eem
agriev'd, and as much offended the other
way; becau&s;e by opening this Trade
with them the Silk Trade and the <HI>Portu|gal</HI>
Wine Trade will be touch'd. But look
into your Woollen Manufacture Trade, if
opening a Trade with <HI>France</HI> Gives you
a Free Market in &s;o large a Country
where you had none before, Shall not
this Encrea&s;e the Con&s;umption of the
Woollen Manufacture? And is not that
of infinitely more vallue than what we
<PB N="39" REF="38">
&s;peak of again&s;t it? Every one agrees
that our Woollen Manufacture is the Life
and Soul of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, and if
this be but forwarded and promoted,
whatever other Trade &s;uffers, it is able
&s;ufficiently to make us amends for that
Lo&s;s: The Employment of Families is
this way, and perhaps this way only to
be &s;upplied. If it were po&s;&s;ible that
other Manufactures could be Encou|rag'd,
and this be Pre&s;erv'd, we &s;hould
all be pleas'd and &s;atisfied: But this
mu&s;t be Pre&s;erv'd, mu&s;t be Encourag'd,
mu&s;t be Extended, what-ever ri&s;que
we run of the re&s;t. Either <HI>France</HI> will,
<HI>upon the making this Treaty Effectual,</HI> take
off a very great quantity of our Wool|len
Manufactures, or it will not; <HI>if it
will not,</HI> Why do we de&s;ire a Treaty of
Commerce at all? Why do we Com|plain
that the <HI>French</HI> have Prohibited
Trade with us? <HI>If it will,</HI> if the Mar|ket
for our Manufactures will be great
in <HI>France,</HI> then what are we Di&s;&s;atisfied
at? and why is not the Treaty now
made our Advantage? Let tho&s;e People
who argue again&s;t it Compare the Ad|vantages
of an Encrea&s;e of our Wollen
Manufacture, with all the Di&s;advan|tages
to other Trades, and &s;ee whether
<PB N="40" REF="39">
the Benefit on one hand is not &s;uch,
that the Lo&s;s on the other hand ought
to be ri&s;qu'd for it.</P>
<P>But here comes in our Complaining
Crouds with Petitions and mournful
Repre&s;entations, That their Manufa|ctures
will be ruin'd; the <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI>
poor People, as I have been told, are
particularly alarm'd, and yet it was
never heard that the <HI>French</HI> ever went
about to make a Piece of Bays in this
World, no, nor are they able to do it,
they know the impracticablene&s;s of it.
What then can be the Di&s;&s;atisfaction
that can affect that &s;ide! I might
name &s;undry other People who are
Employed in Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI>
e&s;pecially tho&s;e which depend upon the
goodne&s;s of the Wooll, whether the
Finene&s;s, or the Length of the Staple:
The Petitions therefore of the&s;e Peo|ple,
if they come, ought to expre&s;s
that their Apprehen&s;ions of the <HI>French</HI>
are grounded upon &s;ufficient Evidence
of Fact, &s;uch as, That they have already
attempted, or are likely to attempt the
making Bays in <HI>France,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40">
It were then to be wi&s;h'd, &s;ome Peo|ple
would calculate a little from ju&s;t pro|po&s;itions,
what quantity of Manufactures
<HI>France</HI> has u&s;ually taken from us, when
we Traded with them upon the Foot
of the Tarif of 1664. and what it is
probable they may take again, if mat|ters
return to that Channel; and
then it would be &s;een what price we
ought to bid, in Order to re&s;tore the
Trade to that Rule of Taxation; and
what &s;uch a purcha&s;e would be worth
in our other Trade, which, as they &s;ay,
we mu&s;t give in Exchange for it; and
this would be a very good way to make
a right Judgment of the thing, for, as
is &s;aid before, either our Goods will
find a Sale in <HI>France,</HI> or they will not;
if they will, it is certainly our Intere&s;t
to procure the Trade to be open, and
though it &s;hould hurt us a little in &s;ome
other branches of our Commerce, the
lo&s;s would not be felt, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> not e|nough
to move us to prevent it, becau&s;e
of the Profit of the Woollen Manu|factures
which is our main Support and
Dependency.</P>
<P>This brings me to mention the Com|plaint
of tho&s;e who are concern'd in the
Silk Manufactures, which is the alter|native
<PB N="42" REF="41">
to the other. The&s;e People are
made to believe, that they &s;hall Infalli|bly
not &s;uffer only, but be ruin'd; and
they talk already of &s;uch a &s;top to the
Weaving, that I know not how many
Journey-men Weavers (more I believe
by a great many than there are in the
whole Broad Weaving Trade) are al|ready
turn'd off, and out of Employ|ment.</P>
<P>I do acknowledge it is a hard and
melancholly Circum&s;tance when any
publick Tran&s;action &s;o cla&s;hes the parts
of the Body, I mean the Body of the
Nation, that one can hardly live with|out
the De&s;truction of the other, and
yet as I &s;aid above, the Woollen Trade
is &s;o great, that there is no compari&s;on
between it and the Silk Manufacture;
neither mu&s;t the pre&s;ervation of the one
be &s;et in competition, when the pre&s;er|vation
of the other is the immediate
Que&s;tion: But what if after all the
Melancholly things which have been &s;aid
upon this Subject, it &s;hould appear, that
the Silk Manufacture in <HI>England</HI> may
be pre&s;erv'd and &s;upported in a con&s;i|&s;tency
with the pre&s;ent Treaty of Com|merce,
and particularly with that part
of the Ninth Article, which Conditions
<PB N="43" REF="42">
for the taking off the Prohibitions upon
the <HI>French</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>England.</HI>
This is a Point few have touch'd upon;
but I make no que&s;tion, it may be farther
handled in time; and tho&s;e Per&s;ons,
whoever they &s;hall be, who &s;hall be
employ'd by the Government to regu|late
the Duties of the two Naions,
and to remove the difficulties that
may be in the way, cannot be &s;o
De&s;titute, as to want a proper medi|um
for the cla&s;hing Intere&s;ts between
the Silk Manufactures of each King|dom
as well as for that of the Woollen.</P>
<P>If then the Woollen Manufacture be
encrea&s;ed, and the Silk not dimini&s;hed,
the Woollen advanced, and the Silk not
di&s;couraged, Men mu&s;t be very much
at a lo&s;s to find out wherein the Da|mage
or Intricacy of the Ninth Ar|ticle
of the Treaty of Commerce does
con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The mi&s;sfortune lies in the difficulty
there is to open the Eyes of the Poor
People, who are &s;everally employ'd in
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, whether of
Silk or Wooll, both which, for ought
I &s;ee, are equally allarm'd, and equally
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with apprehen&s;ions of their
Trade being ruin'd by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
But all popular Di&s;atisfactions are
allay'd by time, the care of the Go|vernment
will be to prevent the real
Mi&s;chiefs, and the Fears of the People
will wear off in the experiment, when
the Woollen Manufacturers &s;hall &s;ee
that a greater quantity of Goods are
Vended than u&s;ed to be, and the Silk
Manufacturers &s;hall &s;ee, that as many
Looms are employ'd as were before,
then the Folly and Blindne&s;s of their
pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ions will abate, and
they will Peaceably acknowledge that
that were mi&s;taken.</P>
