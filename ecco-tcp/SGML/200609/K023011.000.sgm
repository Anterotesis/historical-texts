<HEAD>LETTER I. From Mr. POPE, To AARON HILL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE little Thing which you take &s;o kindly, is but
a very &s;mall Part of what I owe you; and
whatever my Studies, or (to u&s;e a properer Word)
Idlene&s;s, are capable of producing, ought to be re|turned
you in mere Gratitude for the Plea&s;ure I have
received from your own Writings: In which give me
Leave to &s;ay, your good Will to me in particular, is
as di&s;tingui&s;hable, as the Obligation you lay on the
Publick in general. I am very happy in the Envy and
&s;illy Attacks of &s;uch People, as have awakened the
Genero&s;ity of &s;o powerful a Defender. Nor am I
a&s;hamed of tho&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es of mine, which they have
expo&s;ed in Print (the greate&s;t of which was my
thinking too candidly of them, to whom I wrote my
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Letters with &s;o much unguarded Friendline&s;s, and
Freedom), &s;ince you have found a Way to turn tho&s;e
Weakne&s;&s;es into Virtue, by your partial Regard of
them. The Eye of Candour, like the Sun, makes
all the Beauties which it &s;ees; it gives Colour and
Brightne&s;s to the meane&s;t Objects purely by looking
on them. I agree with you, that there is a Plea&s;ure
in &s;eeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the
plaine&s;t Undre&s;s; but few Men are of Con&s;equence
enough to de&s;erve, or reward, that Curio&s;ity. I
&s;hall indeed (and &s;o will all Mankind) be highly
plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Great Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> in this Light,
drawn by him&s;elf, like an antient Ma&s;ter, in rough
Strokes, without heightening, or &s;hadowing: What
a Satisfaction to behold that perfect Likene&s;s, with|out
Art, Affectation, or even the Glo&s;s of Colour|ing,
with a noble Neglect of all that Fini&s;hing and
Smoothing, which any other Hand would have been
obliged to be&s;tow on &s;o principal a Figure? I write
this to a Man who&s;e Judgment I am certain of, and
therefore am as certain you will give the World this
great Depo&s;itum, ju&s;t as you have received it: There
will be no Danger of your dre&s;&s;ing this <HI>Mars</HI> too
finely, who&s;e Armour is not Gold, but Adamant,
and who&s;e Stile in all Probability is much more &s;trong,
than it is poli&s;h'd. I congratulate you, that this great
Trea&s;ure is fallen into your Hands; and I congratu|late
all <HI>Europe,</HI> that it is to be delivered to them.
through the Hands of one, who will think it Sacrilege
to touch upon, much le&s;s to alter, any great Lines of
&s;uch an Original.</P>
<P>I can make you no better Return for your great
Compliment upon me (which it would be Arro|gance
in me to &s;hew to any other, and dangerous
even to remember my&s;elf) but by telling you, that
it is Honour enough to reward all my Studies, to find
my Character and Reputation is Part of the Care of
that Per&s;on, to whom the Fame and Glory of <HI>Peter
Alexiowitz</HI> was committed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
SIR,</P>
<P>I am forced to make u&s;e of another Hand than my
own in this Letter, having received a Wound cro&s;s
all the Veins of my right Hand, by which the Ten|dons
of two Fingers are &s;eparated; however, it was
a Fine paid for my Life, which has been very nar|rowly
&s;aved, and which may now continue me &s;ome
Years longer,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I WAS unwilling to an&s;wer your too obliging Let|ter
(which puts much too great a Stre&s;s upon my
Opinion) till I had read your Play with the Attention
it de&s;erves; I mean, not once, but &s;everal times
over. In a Word, to comply with my Judgment
will co&s;t you no Trouble, except to your Mode&s;ty;
which is, <HI>to act it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</HI> Nothing but
Trifles have I to object, and which were &s;uch as did
not once &s;top me at the fir&s;t Reading; the Spirit,
De&s;ign, and Characters, carrying me on, without
Stop, Check, or even Intermi&s;&s;ion. You certainly
are Ma&s;ter of the Art of the Stage, in the manner of
forming and conducting the De&s;ign, which I think
impo&s;&s;ible to be mended; of that Great Part, and of
the other, the rai&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions, I will &s;ay nothing
to you, who know them &s;o much better than my|&s;elf.
I would only point out a few Particularities in
Thought or Expre&s;&s;ion, as material as excepting to a
Button on your Coat, or a loo&s;e Hair. Two or three
Lines I have with great Timorou&s;ne&s;s written on one
of your blank Leaves, in Black Lead, half afraid to
<PB N="4" REF="5">
be legible, and not without &s;ome Hope that before
you &s;ee them, they may be vani&s;hed: So may per|haps
my Objections, every one of them. Shall I &s;ee
you &s;oon, to tell you the&s;e Nothings? Whenever I
&s;hall &s;ee you, I hope to find, we can employ the
Time better, than I, in telling, or you, in hearing
them. Or mu&s;t I return you the Play now? Your
Orders will be obey'd as &s;oon as you give them.&mdash;I
really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery: I would have
her and you think, the Air of <HI>Richmond</HI> is particularly
good to re-e&s;tabli&s;h her. Pray let Mi&s;s <HI>Hill</HI> know,
I am ready to believe all the good Things her own
Father can &s;ee in her: I can &s;afely tru&s;t both his
<HI>Judgments,</HI> and his <HI>Affections.</HI> I am, truly,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I MADE a &s;trong E&s;&s;ay to have told you in Per|&s;on
how very kindly I took your two la&s;t Letters.
The only Hours I had in my Power from a nece&s;&s;ary
Care that brought me back immediately, I would
have impo&s;ed on you. It will plea&s;e you to know
the poor Woman is rather better, tho' it may be but
like the Improvement of a Light on the End of a
dying Taper, which brightens a little before it ex|pires.&mdash;Your
Hint about my Title <HI>Of fal&s;e Ta&s;te,</HI>
you'll &s;ee, is made u&s;e of in the Second Edition.
Your Opinion al&s;o of my giving &s;ome publick Di&s;|&s;ent
or Prote&s;t again&s;t the &s;illy malicious Mi&s;con|&s;truction
of the Town, I agree to; but I think no
one Step &s;hould be taken in it, but <HI>in Concert</HI> with
the Duke whom they injure. It will be a Plea&s;ure
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y">
felt by you, to tell you, his Grace has written to me
the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urance imaginable of the Rectitude
of his Opinion, and of his Re&s;entment of that Re|port,
which to <HI>Him</HI> is an <HI>Impertinence,</HI> to <HI>me</HI> a <HI>Vil|lainy.</HI></P>
<P>I am afraid of tiring you, and (what is your be&s;t
Security) I have not Time to do it. I'll only ju&s;t
tell you, that many Circum&s;tances you have heard, as
Re&s;emblances to the Picture of <HI>Timon,</HI> are utterly
Inventions of Lyars; the Number of Servants never
was an Hundred, the Paintings not of <HI>Venio</HI> or <HI>La
Guerre,</HI> but <HI>Bellucci</HI> and <HI>Zaman</HI>; no &s;uch Buffet,
Manner of Reception at the Study, Terras, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all
which, and many more, they have not &s;crupled to
forge, to gain &s;ome Credit to the Application: And
(which is wor&s;e) belyed Te&s;timonies of Noblemen,
and of my particular Friends, to condemn me. In
a word, the Malice is as great as the Dulne&s;s, of my
Calumniators: The one I forgive, the other I pity,
and I de&s;pi&s;e both. Adieu; the fir&s;t Day I am near
you I will find you out, and &s;hew you &s;omething you
will like. My be&s;t good Wi&s;hes are yours, and Mi&s;s

<P>SINCE I am fully &s;atisfy'd we are each of us
&s;incerely and affectionately Servants to the other,
I de&s;ire we may be no further mi&s;-led by the Warmth
of writing on this Subject. If you think I have
&s;hewn too much <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> or if I think you have
&s;hewn too much <HI>Warmth,</HI> let us forgive one another's
Temper. I told you I thought my Letter a filly one;
but the more I thought &s;o, the more in &s;ending it I
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;hew'd my Tru&s;t in your good Di&s;po&s;ition toward me.
I am &s;orry you took it to have an Air of <HI>Neglect,</HI> or
<HI>Superiority:</HI> Becau&s;e I know in my Heart, I had not
the lea&s;t Thought of being any way &s;uperior to Mr.
<HI>Hill</HI>; and, far from the lea&s;t De&s;ign to &s;hew Neglect
to a Gentleman who was &s;hewing me Civility, I meant
in Return to &s;hew him a better Thing, Sincerity;
which I'm &s;orry &s;hould be &s;o ill expre&s;s'd as to &s;eem
Rudene&s;s. I meant but to complain as frankly as you,
that all Complaints on both Sides might be out, and at
a Period for ever: I meant by this to have laid a &s;urer
Foundation for your Opinion of me for the future,
that it might no more be &s;haken by Mi&s;takes or
Whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, Sir, you have a higher Opinion of my
Poetry than I my&s;elf. But I am &s;o de&s;irous you
&s;hould have a ju&s;t one of me every way, that I wi&s;h
you under&s;tood both my Temper in general, and my
Ju&s;tice to you in particular, better than I find my
Letter repre&s;ented them. I wi&s;h it the more, &s;ince
you tell me how ill a Picture my Enemies take upon
'em to give, of the Mind of a Man they are utter
Strangers to. However, you will ob&s;erve, that much
<HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Emotion</HI> are a little incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Ne|glect,</HI>
and an Opinion of <HI>Superiority.</HI> Towards Them,
God knows, I never felt any Emotions, but what bad
Writers rai&s;e in all Men, tho&s;e gentle ones of Laughter
or Pity: That I was &s;o open, concern'd, and &s;erious,
with re&s;pect to you only, is &s;ure a Proof of Regard,
not Neglect. For in Truth, nothing ever vex'd me,
till I &s;aw your Epigram again&s;t Dr. S. and me come
out in their Papers: And this, indeed, did vex me, to
&s;ee <HI>One Swan among the Gee&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>That the Letters <HI>A. H.</HI> were apply'd to you in the
Papers, I did not know (for I &s;eldom read them); I
heard it only from Mr. <HI>Savage,</HI> as from your&s;elf, and
&s;eat my A&s;&s;urances to the contrary. But I don't &s;ee
how the Annotator on the <HI>D.</HI> could have rectify'd
<PB N="7" REF="8">
that Mi&s;take, <HI>publickly,</HI> without particularizing <HI>your
Name,</HI> in a Book where I thought it too good to be
in&s;erted. No doubt he has apply'd that Pa&s;&s;age in the
<HI>D.</HI> to you, by the Story he tells; but his Mention of
<HI>Bomba&s;t, only</HI> in &s;ome of your <HI>Juvenile Pieces,</HI> I think,
was meant to &s;hew, that Pa&s;&s;age hinted only at that
<HI>allegorical Muddine&s;s,</HI> and not at any <HI>wor&s;e &s;ort of
Dirt,</HI> with which &s;ome other Writers were charged.
I hate to &s;ay what will not be believ'd: Yet when I
told you, <Q REND="inline">"Many a&s;k'd me to <HI>whom</HI> that Oblique
Prai&s;e was meant?"</Q> I did not tell you I an&s;wer'd,
it was <HI>you.</HI> Has it e&s;cap'd your Ob&s;ervation, that the
Name is a Syllable too long? Or (if you will have it
a Chri&s;tian Name) is there any other in the whole
Book? Is there no Author of two Syllables whom it
will better fit, not only as getting out of the allego|rical
Muddine&s;s, but as having been <HI>dipt in the Dirt
of Party-writing,</HI> and recovering from it betimes? I
know &s;uch a Man, who would take it for a Compli|ment,
and &s;o would his Patrons too&mdash;But I a&s;k you
not to believe this, except you are va&s;tly inclin'd to it.
I will come clo&s;er to the Point: Would you have the
Note <HI>left out?</HI> It &s;hall. Would you have it expre&s;ly
&s;aid, <HI>you were not meant?</HI> It &s;hall, if I have any In|fluence
on the Editors.</P>
<P>I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Re|buke,
and friendlily: I under&s;tood very well the <HI>Ca|veat</HI>
on your Part to be the &s;ame; and complain'd
(you &s;ee) of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting
on my <HI>Behaviour</HI> and <HI>Temper to other Writers</HI>; be|cau&s;e
I knew they were not true, and you could not
know they were.</P>
<P>You cannot in your cool Judgment think it fair to
fix a Man's Character on a Point, of which you do
not give one In&s;tance? Name but the Man, or Men,
to whom I have unju&s;tly omitted Approbation or En|couragement,
and I'll be ready to do them Ju&s;tice. I
<PB N="8" REF="9">
think I have <HI>publickly</HI> prais'd all the be&s;t Writers of my
Time, except your&s;elf, and &s;uch as I have had no fair
Opportunity to prai&s;e. As to the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Popular,</HI>
I've prais'd but few, and tho&s;e at the Times when
they were <HI>lea&s;t popular.</HI> Many of tho&s;e Writers have
done nothing el&s;e but flatter'd the Great and Popular,
or been wor&s;e employ'd by 'em in Party-&s;tuff. I do
indeed think it <HI>no great Pride</HI> in me, to &s;peak about
<HI>them</HI> with &s;ome Air of Superiority; and this, Sir, mu&s;t
be the Cau&s;e (and no other) that made me addre&s;s <HI>that
Declaration</HI> of my Temper towards <HI>them,</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> who
had accus'd me of the contrary; not, I a&s;&s;ure you,
from the lea&s;t Imagination of any Re&s;emblance be|tween
you and them, either in Merit or Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>I nam'd Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> becau&s;e you di&s;tingui&s;h him
from the re&s;t: So do I. But, moreover, he was up|permo&s;t
in my Thoughts, from having endeavour'd
(<HI>before</HI> your Admonition) to promote his Affair, with
Lord <HI>Wilmington,</HI> Lord <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> Lord <HI>Blandford,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Pulteney,</HI> &amp;c. who promis'd me to favour
it. But it would be unju&s;t to mea&s;ure my Good-will
by the Effects of it on the Great, many of whom are
the la&s;t Men in the World who will pay Tributes of
this &s;ort, from their own un-giving Nature; and many
of whom laugh at me when I &s;eriou&s;ly petition for
Mr. <HI>Dennis.</HI> After this, I mu&s;t not name the many
whom I have fruitle&s;ly &s;ollicited: I hope yet to be
more &s;ucce&s;sful. But, Sir, you &s;eem too iniquitous
in your Conceptions of me, when you fan&s;y I call'd
&s;uch Things <HI>Services.</HI> I call'd 'em but <HI>humane Of|fices:</HI>
Services I &s;aid I <HI>would</HI> render him, <HI>if I could.</HI>
I <HI>would</HI> a&s;k a Place for Life for him; and I <HI>have</HI>;
but that is not in my Power: If it was, it would be
a <HI>Service,</HI> and I wi&s;h it.</P>
<P>I mention'd the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of Mr. <HI>D.</HI>'s abu&s;ing
me for forgiving him, becau&s;e he actually did, in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Print, lately repre&s;ent my poor, unde&s;igning, Sub|&s;criptions
to him, to be the Effect of Fear and De&s;ire,
to &s;top his Critiques upon me. I wi&s;h Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> would
(for once) think &s;o candidly of me, as to believe me
&s;incere in one Declaration, that <Q REND="inline">"I de&s;ire no Man
to belye his own Judgment in my Favour."</Q>
Therefore, tho' I acknowledge your generous Offer
to give <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Imperfections</HI> rather out of your
own Works than mine, in your intended Book; I
con&s;ent, with all my Heart, to your confining them
to <HI>mine</HI>; for two Rea&s;ons: The one, that I fear your
Sen&s;ibility that way is greater than my own (by ob|&s;erving
you &s;eem too concern'd at that Hint given by
the Notes on the <HI>D.</HI> of a little Fault in the Works
of your <HI>Youth</HI> only): The other is a better, namely,
that I intend to amend by your Remarks, and correct
the Faults you find, if they are &s;uch as I expect from
Mr. <HI>Hill</HI>'s cool Judgment.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that my <HI>Poetical</HI> Talent is all
that may (I &s;ay not, will) make me <HI>remember'd:</HI> But
it is my <HI>Morality</HI> only that mu&s;t make me <HI>Beloved,</HI> or
<HI>Happy:</HI> And if it be any Deviation from <HI>Greatne&s;s of
Mind,</HI> to prefer Friend&s;hips to Fame, or the hone&s;t
Enjoyments of Life to noi&s;y Prai&s;es; I fairly confe&s;s
that Meanne&s;s. Therefore it is, Sir, that I much
more re&s;ent any Attempt again&s;t my moral Character
(which I know to be unju&s;t) than any to le&s;&s;en
my poetical one (which, for all I know, may be very
ju&s;t).</P>
<P>Pray then, Sir, excu&s;e my weak Letter, as I do your
warm one. I end as I begun. You gue&s;s'd right,
that I was &s;ick when I wrote it: Yours are very well
written, but I have neither Health nor Time to make
mine &s;o. I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of
my Writings (which would greatly improve your Cri|tici&s;ms
on my Errors), but of my Life and Manners
I do not yet repent one Jott, e&s;pecially when I find
in my Heart I continue to be, without the lea&s;t Acri|mony

I never did, or meant you, the lea&s;t Injury; in which

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I AM not more happy, nor feel a greater Ea&s;e in
compari&s;on of my former Pain, in the Recovery
from my Rheumati&s;m, than in that from your Di&s;|plea&s;ure.
Be a&s;&s;ur'd, no little Offenders ever &s;hall
be di&s;tingui&s;h'd more by me. Your Dedication
plea&s;es me almo&s;t equally with the Poem; our Hearts
beat ju&s;t together, in regard to Men of Power and
Quality: But a Series of Infirmities (for my whole
Life has been but one long Di&s;ea&s;e) has hinder'd me
from following your Advices. I this Day have writ
to Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> a Letter with your Poem. The
Familiarity in which we have liv'd &s;ome Years, makes
it not unu&s;ual, in either him or me, to tell each other
any thing that plea&s;es us: Otherwi&s;e you might think
it arrogant in me, to pretend to put &s;o good a Thing
into his Hands, in which I have no Merit. Your
Mention of our Friend Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI> I thank you for,
and &s;hould be glad he would give me an Opportunity
of thanking you in Per&s;on, who am, with Sincerity,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IT is a &s;erious Plea&s;ure to me to find you con|cern'd,
that I &s;hould do your good Sen&s;e and Di&s;|cernment
the Ju&s;tice it de&s;erves. It is impo&s;&s;ible for
me not to think ju&s;t what you would have me on this
Head; the whole <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of your Poem
&s;hews all little Thoughts to be Strangers to your Soul.
I happen to know many Particulars relating to the
Earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s Conduct, and ju&s;t Glory, in
that Scene you draw &s;o well: But no Man ought (I
think) to attempt what you hint at, or can pretend to
do him more Honour than what you your&s;elf here
have done, except him&s;elf: I have long pre&s;s'd him
to put together many Papers lying by him, to that
End. On this late Occa&s;ion he told me you had for|merly
endeavour'd the &s;ame, and it comes into my
Mind, that, on many of tho&s;e Papers, I've &s;een an En|dor&s;ement
<HI>A. H.</HI> which I fan&s;y might be tho&s;e you
overlook'd. My Lord &s;poke of you with great Re|gard,
and told me how narrowly you both mi&s;s'd of
going together on an adventurous Expedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On an Expedition to the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI></NOTE>. The
real Rea&s;on I carry'd him your Poem was, that I
imagin'd you would never &s;end it him, of all Man|kind;
and that I was truly pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>I am troubled to reflect, how unequal a Corre|&s;pondent
I am to you, partly thro' want of Health (for
I have &s;ince had a Fever), partly thro' want of Spirits,
and want of Solitude; for the la&s;t Thing we Poets
care to own, is the other Want; that of Abilities.</P>
<P>But I am &s;en&s;ibly pleas'd with your Letter, not
only with that which &s;eem'd to prompt it, but with
the Things &s;aid in it: And I thank you for both&mdash;Believe me de&s;irous to &s;ee you: When, and where,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
you &s;hall determine; tho' I wi&s;h it were here:
You'll &s;ee a Place &s;eeming more fit for me than it is;
looking Poetical, yet too much in the World; Ro|mantic,
and not Retir'd: However, I can lock up
all Avenues to it &s;ometimes, and I know no better
Rea&s;on for doing &s;o, or for &s;hutting out the World,

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE very Moment I receive yours, I di&s;patch
this, to tell you with Sincerity both my
Gue&s;t's and my own Concern to have no Hopes of
&s;eeing you; as well as, what is unfeignedly a yet
greater Concern, our Sorrow at what you expre&s;s to
be the Occa&s;ion of it. He wi&s;hes, now, for Power,
for no other Rea&s;on, than to be able to elevate Merit
above that Fortune it commonly finds, from Power.
And I can truly add, for my own Part, who never
ta&s;ted Power, that I never felt any Unea&s;ine&s;s in a
low Fortune, but that which it cau&s;es when I find it
cannot prove the Regard and Love I bear to true
Worth in any afflictive Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e my pretending to &s;ay a Word on that Sub|ject;
all I meant to &s;ay (but the Overflowings of my
Heart vented thus much) was, to beg you to think
too favourably of us both, to imagine we &s;hould not
be unhappy as much as di&s;&s;atisfy'd, if we did not read
once or twice more your Tragedy, after what you
tell us of your having alter'd it on our Sugge&s;tions.
We have a con&s;cientious Fear, that you may have
comply'd too implicitly with tho&s;e <HI>Marks,</HI> rather of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
our &s;crupulous Sincerity, than of any certain Judg|ment;
and have quench'd &s;ometimes a Flame we
admire, tho' we may fear; or &s;ometimes heighten'd
what may be natural, tho' we might think it low.
Pray ea&s;e us, by favouring us with a &s;econd View
of it.</P>
<P>And whenever you &s;end me that E&s;&s;ay, you may
be a&s;&s;ur'd of my &s;incere An&s;wer; tho' upon that
Head I could rather wi&s;h it were given you per&s;onally.
I hope a little Time will bring us together. Know

<P>I COULD not per&s;uade my&s;elf to write to you
&s;ince your great Lo&s;s, till I hop'd you had re|ceiv'd
&s;ome Alleviation to it, from the only Hand
which can give any, that of Time. Not to have
mention'd it, however fa&s;hionable it may be, I think
unnatural, and in &s;ome Sen&s;e inhuman; and I fear
the contrary Cu&s;tom is too much an Excu&s;e, in
reality, for that Indifference we too u&s;ually have for
the Concern of another: In truth, that was not my
Ca&s;e: I know the Rea&s;on of one Man is of little
Effect toward the Re&s;ignation of another; and when
I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine, I doubted
not which had the Advantage, even tho' in your own
Concern. 'Tis hard, that in the&s;e tender Afflictions
the Greatne&s;s of the Mind and the Goodne&s;s are op|po&s;ite
to each other; and that while Rea&s;on, and the
Con&s;ideration upon what Conditions we receive all
the Goods of this Life, operate towards our Quiet;
even the be&s;t of our Pa&s;&s;ions (which are the &s;ame
Things with the &s;ofte&s;t of our Virtues) refu&s;e us that
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Comfort. But I'll &s;ay no more on this melancholy
Subject. The whole Intent of this Letter is to tell you
how much I wi&s;h you capable of Con&s;olation, and
how much I wi&s;h to know when you find your&s;elf
&s;o. I would hope you begin to &s;eek it, to amu&s;e
your Mind with tho&s;e Studies of which <HI>Tully</HI> &s;ays,
<HI>Adver&s;is perfugium &amp; &s;olatium praebent,</HI> and to tran|&s;cribe
(if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) your own Softne&s;&s;es
and generous Pa&s;&s;ions into the Hearts of others who
more want them. I do not flatter you in &s;aying, I
think your Tragedy will do this effectually (to which
I had Occa&s;ion, the other Day, to do Ju&s;tice to Mr.
<HI>Wilks</HI>), or whatever el&s;e you chu&s;e to divert your own

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I Troubled you with a ha&s;ty Scrawl at Lord <HI>Tyr|connel</HI>'s,
in which I mention'd <HI>Gilliver</HI>'s De&s;ire to
be the Publi&s;her of your Tragedy: Since, he re|que&s;ts
my Letter to recommend him. I find Mr.
<HI>Savage</HI> has rais'd his Hope, by &s;aying you had kept
<HI>your&s;elf unengag'd, in Expectation that I would</HI> plead
for him, and that <HI>you wonder'd I did not &s;ooner.</HI> If
this be not one of tho&s;e Things in which Mr. <HI>S.</HI>
&s;peaks upon Imagination, I am more oblig'd to you
than ever I intended. For I a&s;&s;ure you, I had no
Thought of <HI>impo&s;ing,</HI> nay, not even of <HI>propo&s;ing</HI> a
Book&s;eller, for fear your great Complacency toward
me, &s;hould lead you, more, than your own Inclina|tion,
to another Book&s;eller. But if you have no &s;uch
Byafs, this Man I really think hone&s;t, and capable in
his Bu&s;ine&s;s. I hope in a few Days to meet you in
Town, and am &s;incerely yours, and the young

<P>I Thank you for your Tragedy, which I have now
read over a &s;ixth Time, and of which I not only
pre&s;erve, but increa&s;e, my E&s;teem. You have been
kind to this Age, in not telling the next, in your Pre|face,
the ill Ta&s;te of the Town, of which the Re|ception
<PB N="25" REF="28">
you de&s;cribe it to have given of your Play
(wor&s;e, indeed, than I had heard, or could have ima|gin'd),
is a more flagrant In&s;tance than any of tho&s;e
Trifles mention'd in my Epi&s;tle; which yet, I hear,
the &s;ore Vanity of our Pretenders to Ta&s;te flinches at
extremely&mdash;The Title you mention had been a pro|perer
to that Epi&s;tle&mdash;I have heard no Critici&s;ms about
it, nor do I li&s;ten after 'em; <HI>Nos haec novimus e&s;&s;e
nihil</HI> (I mean, I think the Ver&s;es to be &s;o): But as
you are a Man of tender Sentiments of Honour, I
know it will grieve you to hear another unde&s;ervedly
charg'd with a Crime his Heart is free from: For, if
there be Truth in the World, I declare to you, I
never imagin'd the lea&s;t Application of what I &s;aid of
<HI>Timon</HI> could be made to the D. of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s,</HI> than whom
there is &s;carce a more blamele&s;s, worthy and gene|rous,
beneficent Character, among all our Nobility:
And if I have not lo&s;t my Sen&s;es, the Town has lo&s;t
'em, by what I heard &s;o late, as but two Days ago,
of the Uproar on this Head. I am certain, if you
calmly read every Particular of that De&s;cription,
you'll find almo&s;t all of 'em point-blank the Rever&s;e
of that Per&s;on's <HI>Villa.</HI> It's an aukward Thing for a
Man to print, in Defence of his own Work, again&s;t
a Chimaera: You know not who, or what, you fight
again&s;t: The Objections &s;tart up in a new Shape,
like the Armies and Phantoms of Magicians, and no
Weapon can cut a Mi&s;t, or a Shadow. Yet it would
have been a Plea&s;ure to me, to have found &s;ome
Friend &s;aying a Word in my Ju&s;tification, again&s;t a
mo&s;t malicious Fal&s;hood. I &s;peak of &s;uch, as have
known by their own Experience, the&s;e twenty Years,
that I always took up their Defence, when any
Stream of Calumny ran upon 'em. If it gives the
Duke one Moment's Unea&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hould think my|&s;elf
ill paid, if the whole Earth admir'd the Poetry;
and believe me, would rather never have written a
Ver&s;e in my Life, than that any one of 'em &s;hould
<PB N="26" REF="29">
trouble a truly good Man. It was once my Ca&s;e be|fore,
but happily reconcil'd; and among generous
Minds nothing &s;o endears Friends, as the having of|fended
one another.</P>
<P>I lament the Malice of the Age, that &s;tudies to &s;ee
its own Likene&s;s in every thing; I lament the Dulne&s;s
of it, that cannot &s;ee an Excellence: The fir&s;t is my
Unhappine&s;s, the &s;econd yours. I look upon the
Fate of your Piece, like that of a great Trea&s;ure,
which is bury'd as &s;oon as brought to Light; but it is
&s;ure to be dug up the next Age, and enrich Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I have been very &s;en&s;ible, on the&s;e two Occa&s;ions,
to feel them (as I have done) at a Time, when I daily
fear'd the Lo&s;s of (what is, and ought to be dearer
to me than any Reputation, <HI>but that of a Friend,</HI> or
than any thing of my own, <HI>except my Morals</HI>) the
Lo&s;s of a mo&s;t tender Parent&mdash;She is alive, and that

<P>YOUR very kind Letter came hither in my
Ab&s;ence, which occa&s;ion'd my Delay till now
in acknowledging it. Your Partiality to me, both
as a Poet, and as a Man, is great; the former I de|&s;erve
not, but the latter I will never forfeit. It
would be wronging your Mode&s;ty to &s;ay much of the

<P>I have almo&s;t forgot what I told you of the Patent;
but at the Time I told it, I could not well be mi&s;|taken,
having ju&s;t then had the Account from Mr.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I SENT you as hone&s;t an An&s;wer as I could, to
the Letter you favour'd me with; and am &s;orry
you imagine any <HI>civil Reproach,</HI> or <HI>latent Meaning,</HI>
where I meant to expre&s;s my&s;elf with the utmo&s;t
Openne&s;s. I would a&s;&s;ure you, if you plea&s;e, by
my Oath, as well as my Word, that I am in no De|gree
di&s;pleas'd at any Freedom you can take with me
in a private Letter, or with my Writings in publick.
I again in&s;i&s;t, that you alter or &s;often no one Critici&s;m
of yours in my Favour; nor deprive your&s;elf of the
Liberty, nor the World of the Profit, of your free&s;t
Remarks on my Errors.</P>
<P>In what I &s;aid, I gave you a true Picture of my
own Heart, as far as I know it my&s;elf. It is true, I
have &s;hewn a <HI>Scorn</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Writers</HI>; but it proceeded
from an Experience that they were bad Men, or bad
Friends, or vile Hirelings; in which Ca&s;e, their being
Authors did not make them, to me, either more re|&s;pectable,
or more formidable. As for any other
Pique, my Mind is not &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of it as you
have &s;eem'd, on each Occa&s;ion, too much inclin'd
(I think) to believe. What may have &s;ometimes
&s;eem'd a <HI>Neglect</HI> of others, was rather a <HI>Lazine&s;s</HI> to
cultivate or contract new Friends, when I was &s;ati&s;|fied
<PB N="29" REF="32">
with tho&s;e I had; or when I apprehended their
Demands were too high for me to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I thank you for the Confidence you &s;hew you have
in me, in telling me what you judge ami&s;s in my
<HI>Nature.</HI> If it be (as you too partially &s;ay) my only
Fault, I might &s;oon be a perfect Character: For I
would endeavour to correct this Fault in my&s;elf, and
intreat you to correct all tho&s;e in my Writings; I
&s;ee, by the Specimen you generou&s;ly gave me in your
late Letter, you are able to do it; and I would rather
owe (and <HI>own</HI> I owe) that Correction to your Friend|&s;hip,
than to my own Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>For the la&s;t Paragraph of yours, I &s;hall be ex|tremely
ready to convey what you promi&s;e to &s;end
me, to my Lord <HI>B.</HI> I am in Hopes very &s;peedily to
&s;ee him my&s;elf, and will, in that Ca&s;e, be the Bearer;
if not, I &s;hall &s;end it, by the fir&s;t &s;afe Hand, to him.
I am truly glad of any Occa&s;ion of proving my&s;elf,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE Favour of yours of <HI>May</HI> the 11th, had
not been unacknowledged &s;o long, but it
reached me not till my Return from a Journey, which
had carried me from Scene to Scene, <HI>where Gods
might wander with Delight.</HI> I am &s;orry yours was
attended with any Thoughts le&s;s plea&s;ing, either from
the Conduct towards you of the World in general, or
of any one el&s;e, in particular. As to the Subject-matter
of the Letter, I found what I have often done
in receiving Letters from tho&s;e I mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and
<PB N="30" REF="33">
mo&s;t wi&s;hed to be e&s;teemed by; a great Plea&s;ure in
reading it, and a great Inability to an&s;wer it. I can
only &s;ay, you oblige me, in &s;eeming &s;o well to know
me again; as one extremely willing that the free
Exerci&s;e of Critici&s;m &s;hould extend over my own
Writings, as well as tho&s;e of others, whenever the
Public may receive the lea&s;t Benefit from it; as I
que&s;tion not they will a great deal, when exerted by
you. I am &s;en&s;ible of the Honour you do me, in
propo&s;ing to &s;end me your Work before it appears:
If you do, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that no U&s;e in my Favour
be made of that Di&s;tinction, by the Alteration or
&s;oftening of any Cen&s;ure of yours on any Line of
mine.</P>
<P>What you have ob&s;erved in your Letter I think
ju&s;t; only I would acquit my&s;elf in one Point: I
could not have the lea&s;t <HI>Pique</HI> to Mr. <HI>Th.</HI> in what is
cited in the Treati&s;e of the <HI>Bathos</HI> from the Play
which I never &s;uppo&s;ed to be his: He gave it as
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, and I take it to be of that Age: And
indeed the Collection of tho&s;e, and many more of
the Thoughts cen&s;ured there, was not made by me,
but Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot.</HI>&mdash;I have had two or three Occa|&s;ions
to lament, that you &s;eem to know me much
better as a <HI>Poet,</HI> than as a <HI>Man.</HI> You can hardly
conceive how little either Pique or Contempt I bear
to any Creature, unle&s;s for immoral or dirty Actions:
Any Mortal is at full Liberty, unan&s;wer'd, to
write and print of me as a Poet, to prai&s;e me one
Year, and blame me another; only I de&s;ire him to
&s;pare my Character as an hone&s;t Man, over which he
can have no private, much le&s;s any public, Right,
without &s;ome per&s;onal Knowledge of my Heart, or
the Motives of my Conduct: Nor is it a &s;ufficient
Excu&s;e, to alledge he was <HI>&s;o</HI> or <HI>&s;o informed,</HI> which
was the Ca&s;e with tho&s;e Men.</P>
<P>I am &s;incere in all I &s;ay to you, and have no Va|nity
in &s;aying it. You really over-value me greatly
<PB N="31" REF="34">
in my Poetical Capacity; and I am &s;ure your Work
would do me infinitely too much Honour, even if it
blamed me oftener than it commended: For the fir&s;t
you will do with Lenity, the la&s;t with Exce&s;s. But
I could be glad to part with &s;ome Share of any good
Man's Admiration, for &s;ome of his Affection, and
his Belief that I am not wholly unde&s;erving to be
thought, what I am to you,</P>

excel throughout in the Greatne&s;s of Sentiment;
and I add, that I never met with more &s;triking Sen|tences,
or lively &s;hort Reprizes. There is almo&s;t
every-where &s;uch a Dignity in the Scenes, that in|&s;tead
of pointing out any one Scene, I can &s;carce
point out any that wants it, in any Degree (except
you would a little rai&s;e that of the <HI>Plebeians</HI> in the la&s;t

Softne&s;s, in the Scenes between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Calpur|nia:</HI>
And all tho&s;e between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> are a
noble Strife between Greatne&s;s and Humanity. The
Management of the Whole is as artful as it is noble.
Whatever particular Remarks we have made further,

in the Scene that follows between him and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI>
all Tenderne&s;s on the Side of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and all beyond
the Point of Honour that Friend&s;hip exacted, &s;hould
not rather be avoided than heightened?</P>
<P>Another Quere is, Whether it would not beget
more Indignation in the Audience again&s;t <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> and
more Compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> to &s;hew that <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> &s;u|&s;pected
<HI>Brutus</HI> to be <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Son, and therefore ex|acted
from <HI>Brutus</HI> the Oath of &s;paring neither <HI>Father</HI>;
Relation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The third Thing is, Whether the Efforts made by
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to prevent the Civil War, not only by the
equal Offer he made, while the Matter was under
Debate in the Senate (and which the Con&s;uls <HI>Len|tulus</HI>
and <HI>Marcellus</HI> refu&s;ed to report to the Senate),
but by the Me&s;&s;age he &s;ent to <HI>Pompey,</HI> when he was at
<HI>Brundu&s;ium,</HI> to de&s;ire a Meeting, to &s;ettle the Matter,
and avoid the Civil War.&mdash;<HI>Vid. Cae&s;. Comm. de bell,</HI>
<HI>Civili, lib.</HI> 1. The Mention of the&s;e &s;omewhere in
the Play might help to remove the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t
<HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>After our little Cavils (for &s;o we will rather call
minute and verbal Points of Critici&s;m) we owe you
the Ju&s;tice to extol highly, what we highly approve,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and you need not de&s;ire us to &s;peak as we think: 'Tis
what we have (in different Ways) done all our Lives,
where it was to our Prejudice, and cannot but do
here, where it is to our Honour. I only wi&s;h you a
Stage, Actors, and an Audience worthy of you, and
It.&mdash;I have often wi&s;hed to live to &s;ee the Day when
Prologues and Epilogues &s;hould be no more. I
wi&s;h a great Genius would break thro' the &s;illy,
u&s;ele&s;s, Formality. But at lea&s;t I would have one
try, to leave the Audience <HI>full</HI> of the <HI>Effects</HI> of a
good Tragedy, without an Epilogue. Let me add
another Hint, concerning the Apparatus and Circum|&s;tantials
of your Play (&s;ince I have nothing left more
to wi&s;h in the Play it&s;elf); that you would intitle it
barely, <HI>The Tragedy of Cae&s;ar,</HI> and give no Intima|tion
of his being a <HI>Patriot</HI>; for I fear, in&s;tead of
preparing the Audience, it might revolt them, and
put all the little Criticks upon carping previou&s;ly at
the very De&s;ign and Character; which would appear
by Degrees, and with the proper Preparations, in
the Piece on the Stage. Another thing was a Thought
of my Lord's, that it &s;hould be printed before acting,
a Day or two; for the Sentiments are &s;o thick-&s;own,
and the Sen&s;e &s;o deep &s;ometimes, that they require
more Attention and Thought than the Hearer may be
apt to give on the fir&s;t Repre&s;entation. I am not
po&s;itive, either as to his, or my Thought, but &s;ub|mit
them to your Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add, but to lament our Unhappi|ne&s;s,
that we cannot &s;ee you per&s;onally to confirm
what the&s;e Letters tell you, of our real Opinion of
your Work, E&s;teem of its Author, and Wi&s;hes for
your Succe&s;s, in this, and every thing. I am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THIS is quite a Letter of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore
excu&s;e it; I will not mix in it a Word of Af|fection,
which I have not a Moment's time to ex|pre&s;s,
and will not prejudice the &s;acred Idea of
Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is near a Month ago that I try'd to &s;ee Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> to know the Time of his Tragedy: He was
not within my Reach; and therefore at la&s;t I wrote
to him, and al&s;o to Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> to let them both
know the Deference you paid them, and the heroic

in regard to them. I have not yet been able to hear
where they are, or any way to have an An&s;wer fur|ther,
than I have learn'd it will be impo&s;&s;ible for ei|ther
of them to bring on their Plays early (a Friend
of theirs telling me they are in no Forwardne&s;s) till
the Middle or End of the Winter; therefore you
may have room. I wi&s;h from my Soul you may get
yours fir&s;t, as well acted as it de&s;erves. A better,
that may eclip&s;e it, or even worthily follow it, I
hardly expect to &s;ee.&mdash;But upon this Notice, I
believe you may &s;afely advance it, the &s;ooner the
better.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>B.</HI> is yet with me, more properly I yet
belong to him, Body as well as Mind (for my Mind
is every-where his). I would to God you had any
Opportunity of &s;eeing us before we part; my Hou&s;e
&s;hould be yours, as much of it as is not his. I be|lieve
I &s;hall &s;oon go with him on a little Journey be|fore

<P>I HAVE been confirmed by Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on</HI> as to the
Retardment of his Play, of which he has written
but two Acts. I have &s;ince &s;een Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> who

which may be apprehended from one Per&s;on's
Refu&s;al or Unwillingne&s;s to act, and believes he can
employ &s;ome proper Influence to bring him to a

<P>I mu&s;t expre&s;s, on my own Part, a real Regret to
be &s;o little u&s;eful to you. I can do no more than
join with Lord <HI>B.</HI> in paying due Prai&s;es to &s;o merito|rious

<P>I HAVE felt an Unea&s;ine&s;s of Mind (occa&s;ioned by
a con&s;cious Sen&s;e, how unequally I have expre&s;s'd
my Anger and Contempt, at the Treatment of your
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> by the Man of the Stage) ever &s;ince I la&s;t
wrote to you; and a hundred Interruptions from Day
to Day (for I have lived in the World, and a bu&s;y
and idle World both, it is) have ever &s;ince hindered
me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought.
Yet I am the le&s;s concerned, &s;ince, by my Delay, I
can now tell you I have la&s;t Night &s;een Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI>'s
Play, the fifth Act of which I had not before read,
thro' tho&s;e Interruptions I have mention'd. It &s;uc|ceeded
(hitherto at lea&s;t; for Ye&s;terday was the fir&s;t
Day) as well as I could expect: But &s;o vilely acted
in the Womens Parts and the Mens (except two) that
I wonder it could &s;ucceed. Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> after many
&s;hameful Tricks from the Manager, is determined to
act his Play at the other Theatre, where the Ad|vantage
<PB N="38" REF="41">
lies as to the Women, and the Succe&s;s of <HI>his</HI>
will depend upon them (I heartily wi&s;h you would
follow his Example, that we might not be deprived
of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>). I have yet &s;een but three Acts of Mr.
<HI>Thom&s;on</HI>'s, but I am told, and believe by what I have
&s;een, that it excels in the Pathetic. The Dignity
of Sentiment, and Grandeur of Character, will &s;till be
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s, as in his Hi&s;tory, &s;o in your Poetry, &s;upe|rior
to any.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on to whom you intended &s;o great a Com|pliment
as to addre&s;s that Piece to his Name, is very
&s;en&s;ible of your delicate Manner of Thinking: He
bids me a&s;&s;ure you, his own Knowledge of your In|tention
is &s;ufficient Plea&s;ure to him, and de&s;ires you
would not think of doing him either Favour or Ju&s;tice,
till the World knows better how to do it&s;elf the for|mer,
in doing you the latter. He is &s;till detained
here by the Perver&s;ene&s;s of his Affairs; and wi&s;hes,
as I mo&s;t heartily do al&s;o, that Fortune did not treat
you &s;o much alike. The Stage is as ungrateful to
you, as his Country to him: You are both &s;ure of

<P>I AM oblig'd to you for your Compliment, and
can truly &s;ay, I never gave you ju&s;t Cau&s;e of
Complaint. You once mi&s;took on a Book&s;eller's
idle Report, and publickly expre&s;s'd your Mi&s;take;
yet you mi&s;took a &s;econd time, that two initial Let|ters,
only, were meant of you, tho' every Letter in
<PB N="39" REF="42">
the Alphabet was put in the &s;ame manner: And, in
Truth (except &s;ome few), tho&s;e Letters were &s;et at
Random to occa&s;ion what they did occa&s;ion, the Su|&s;picion
of bad and jealous Writers, of which Num|ber
I could never reckon Mr. <HI>Hill.</HI> and mo&s;t of who&s;e
Names I did not know.</P>
<P>Upon this Mi&s;take you were too ready to attack
me, in a Paper of very pretty Ver&s;es, in &s;ome publick
Journal.&mdash;I &s;hould imagine the <HI>Dunciad</HI> meant you
a real Compliment, and &s;o it has been thought by
many, who have a&s;k'd, to whom that Pa&s;&s;age made
that oblique <HI>Panegyrick?</HI> As to the Notes, I am
weary of telling a great Truth, which is, that I am
not Author of 'em; tho' I love Truth &s;o well, as
fairly to tell you, Sir, I think even that Note a Com|mendation,
and &s;hould think my&s;elf not ill us'd <HI>to
have the &s;ame Words &s;aid of me:</HI> Therefore, believe
me, I never was other than friendly to you, in my

<P>Have I not much more Rea&s;on to complain of <HI>The

with the &s;ame Love of Truth, and with the Frank|ne&s;s

Sir, a very great Error: I am &s;orry the Author of
that Reflection knew me no better, and happen'd to
be unknown to tho&s;e who could have better inform'd
him: For I have the Charity to think, he was mi&s;led
only by his Ignorance of me, and the Benevolence to
forgive the wor&s;t Thing that ever (in my Opinion)
was &s;aid of me, on that Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I do faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, I never was angry at any
Critici&s;m, made on my Poetry, by whom&s;oever: If
I could do Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> any humane Office, I would,
tho' I were &s;ure he would abu&s;e me per&s;onally To|morrow;
therefore it is no great Merit in me, to
<PB N="40" REF="43">
find, at my Heart, I am your Servant. I am very
&s;orry you ever was of another Opinion.&mdash;I &s;ee, by
many Marks, you di&s;tingui&s;h'd me from my cotem|porary
Writers: Had we known one another, you
had di&s;tingui&s;h'd me from others, as a <HI>Man,</HI> and no
ill, or ill-natur'd one. I only wi&s;h you knew, as well
as I do, how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to
tho&s;e of the Head: I vow to God, I never thought
any great Matters of my poetical Capacity; I only
thought it a little better, comparatively, than that of
&s;ome very mean Writers, who are too proud.&mdash;But,
I do know <HI>certainly,</HI> my moral Life is <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to that

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 28. 1730-1.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>YOUR An&s;wer, regarding no Part of mine, but
the Conclu&s;ion, you mu&s;t pardon my Compli|ment
to the Clo&s;e of yours, in return; if I agree
with you, that your Letter is <HI>weaker,</HI> than one would
have expected.</P>
<P>You a&s;&s;ure me, that I did not know you &s;o well,
as I might, had I happened to be known to others,
who could have in&s;tructed my Ignorance; and I begin
to find, indeed, that I was le&s;s acquainted with you,
than I imagined: But your la&s;t Letter has enlighten'd
me, and I can never be in Danger of mi&s;taking you,
for the future.</P>
<P>Your Enemies have often told me, that your <HI>Spleen</HI>
was, at lea&s;t, as di&s;tingui&s;hable, as your <HI>Genius:</HI>
And it will be kinder, I think, to believe them, than
impute to Rudene&s;s, or ill Manners, the Return you
were plea&s;ed to make, for the Civility, with which I
addre&s;&s;ed you.</P>
<P>I will, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e you to have been <HI>peevi&s;h,</HI>
or in <HI>Pain,</HI> while you were writing me this Letter:
And, upon that Suppo&s;ition, &s;hall endeavour to un|deceive
you.&mdash;If I did not love you, as a good <HI>Man,</HI>
while I e&s;teem you, as a good <HI>Writer,</HI> I &s;hould read
you without Reflection: And it were doing too much
Honour to <HI>your</HI> Friends, and too little to my <HI>own
Di&s;cernment,</HI> to go to <HI>them</HI> for a Character of your
Mind, which I was able enough to extract from your
Writings.</P>
<P>But, to imitate your Love of Truth, with the
Frankne&s;s you have taught me, I wi&s;h the <HI>Great</HI>
Qualities of your Heart were as &s;trong in you as the
<HI>Good</HI> ones: You would then have been above that
Emotion and Bitterne&s;s, wherewith you remember
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Things which want Weight to de&s;erve your An|gui&s;h.</P>
<P>Since you were not the Writer of the Notes to the
<HI>Dunciad,</HI> it would be impertinent to trouble you
with the Complaint I intended:&mdash;I will only ob&s;erve,
that the Author was in the <HI>Right,</HI> to believe me ca|pable
of a &s;econd <HI>Repentance</HI>; but, I hope, I was
incapable of that &s;econd <HI>Sin,</HI> which &s;hould have
been previous to his Suppo&s;ition.&mdash;If the initial Let|ters
<HI>A. H.</HI> were not <HI>meant</HI> to &s;tand for my Name,
yet, they were, every-where, read &s;o, as you might
have &s;een in <HI>Mi&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> and other publick Pa|pers;
and I had &s;hewn Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> an Example, how
rea&s;onable I thought it to clear a Mi&s;take, publickly,
which had been publickly propagated.&mdash;One Note,
among &s;o many, would have done me this Ju&s;tice:
And the Genero&s;ity of &s;uch a Proceeding could have
left no Room, for that offen&s;ive <HI>Sneakingly,</HI> which,
though, perhaps, too har&s;h a Word, was the pro|pere&s;t
a Man could chu&s;e, who was &s;atirizing an
Approbation, that he had never ob&s;erved warm
enough to declare it&s;elf to the World, but in De|fence
of the <HI>Great,</HI> or the <HI>Popular.</HI></P>
<P>Again, if the Author of the Notes knew, that
<HI>A. H.</HI> related not to me, what Rea&s;on had he to al|lude
to that Character, as mine, by ob&s;erving, that
I had publi&s;hed Pieces bordering upon <HI>Bomba&s;t</HI>&mdash;A Circum&s;tance &s;o independent on any other Purpo&s;e
of the Note, that I &s;hould forget to <HI>whom</HI> I am
writing, if I thought it wanted Explanation.</P>
<P>As to your oblique Panegyrick, I am not under &s;o
blind an Attachment to the <HI>Godde&s;s</HI> I was devoted
to in the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> but that I knew it was a <HI>Com|mendation</HI>;
tho' a dirtier one than I wi&s;hed for; who
am, neither fond of &s;ome of the Company, in which
I was li&s;ted&mdash;the noble Reward, for which I was to
become a Diver;&mdash;the allegoric Muddine&s;s, in
which I was to try my Skill;&mdash;nor the In&s;titutor
<PB N="43" REF="46">
of the Games, you were &s;o kind to allow me a
Share in.</P>
<P>Since, however, you could &s;ee, &s;o clearly, that I
ought to be &s;atisfied with the Prai&s;e, and forgive the
Dirt it was mixed with, I am &s;orry, it &s;eemed not
as rea&s;onable, that you &s;hould pardon me for return|ing
your Compliment, with more, and opener, Prai&s;e,
mixed with le&s;s of that Dirtine&s;s, which we have,
both, the good Ta&s;te to complain of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caveat,</HI> Sir, was mine.&mdash;It would have been
ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e you ignorant of it: I cannot
think, you need be told, that it meant you no
Harm;&mdash;and it had &s;corn'd to appear under the bor|row'd
Name, it carries, but that the whim&s;ical Turn
of the Preface, would have made my own a Contra|diction.&mdash;I promi&s;e you, however, that, for the fu|ture,
I will publi&s;h nothing, without my Name, that
concerns you, or your Writings. I have, now,
almo&s;t fini&s;hed, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on Propriety, and Impro|priety,
in De&s;ign, Thought, and Expre&s;&s;ion, illu&s;trated,
by Examples, in both Kinds, from the Writings of Mr.
Pope</HI>; and, to convince you how much more Plea&s;ure
it gives me, to di&s;tingui&s;h your <HI>Lights,</HI> than your
<HI>Shades</HI>;&mdash;and that I am as willing as I ought to be,
to &s;ee, and acknowledge my Faults; I am ready,
with all my Heart, to let it run thus, if it would,
otherwi&s;e, create the lea&s;t Pain in you:&mdash;<HI>An E&s;&s;ay
on Propriety, and Impropriety,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>illu&s;trated by Ex|amples,
of the fir&s;t, from the Writings of Mr.</HI> Pope,
<HI>and of the la&s;t, from tho&s;e of the Author.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry to hear you &s;ay, you never thought any
great Matters of your <HI>Poetry.</HI>&mdash;It is, in my Opinion,
the Characteri&s;tic you are to hope your <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI>
from: To be <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> is the Duty of every <HI>plain Man!</HI>
Nor, &s;ince the <HI>Soul</HI> of Poetry is Sentiment, can a
<HI>Great Poet</HI> want <HI>Morality.</HI> But your <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> you
po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with a <HI>Million,</HI> who will never be
<PB N="44" REF="47">
<HI>remembered</HI>; whereas your <HI>Poetry</HI> is a Peculiar, that
will make it impo&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould be forgotten.</P>
<P>If you had not been in the <HI>Spleen,</HI> when you
wrote me this Letter, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, you would
not, immediately after cen&s;uring the <HI>Pride</HI> of Writers,
have a&s;&s;erted, that you, <HI>certainly, know</HI> your moral
Life, above that of mo&s;t of the Wits of the&s;e Days:
At any other Time, you would have remembered,
that <HI>Humility</HI> is a moral Virtue. It was a bold De|claration;
and the <HI>Certainty</HI> with which you know
it, &s;tands in need of a better <HI>Acquaintance</HI> than you
&s;eem to have had with the <HI>Tribe</HI>; &s;ince you tell me,
in the &s;ame Letter, that many of their <HI>Names</HI> were
<HI>unknown</HI> to you.</P>
<P>Neither would it appear, to your own Rea&s;on, at
a cooler Juncture, over-con&s;i&s;tent with the Morality
you are &s;o &s;ure of, to &s;catter the Letters of the whole
Alphabet, annexed, at Random, to Characters of a
light and ridiculous Ca&s;t, confu&s;edly, with Intent to
provoke jealous Writers, into Re&s;entment, that you
might take Occa&s;ion, from that Re&s;entment, to ex|po&s;e
and depreciate their Characters.</P>
<P>The Services, you tell me, you would do Mr.
<HI>Dennis,</HI> even tho' he &s;hould abu&s;e you, in Return, will,
I hope, give him &s;ome Title to expect an Exertion
of your recommendatory Influence in his Behalf: A
Man, &s;o <HI>popular,</HI> as you, might &s;ecure him a great
Sub&s;cription: This would merit to be called a
<HI>Service</HI>; and, the more the World &s;hould find
you abu&s;ed in the Works you had recommended,
&s;o much the more glorious Proof would they &s;ee,
that your Morals were, in Truth, as &s;uperior, as
you repre&s;ent them, to tho&s;e of your Cotempora|ries.
Tho' you will pardon me the <HI>Pride</HI> of won|dering,
a little, how this Declaration came to be
made to <HI>me,</HI> who&s;e Condition not &s;tanding in need
of &s;uch Services, it was not, I think, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="45" REF="48" MS="y">
you &s;hould have taken the Trouble to talk of
them.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, Sir, I find, I am &s;o &s;incerely your
<HI>Friend,</HI> that it is not, in your own Power, to make
me your <HI>Enemy:</HI> El&s;e, that unnece&s;&s;ary Air, of
Neglect, and Superiority, which is &s;o remarkable,
in the Turn of your Letter, would have nettled me
to the Quick; and I mu&s;t triumph, in my Turn, at

<P>I AM oblig'd to you for your Letter from <HI>Par&s;ons
Green,</HI> and come heartily into the Propo&s;al, it
begins with: A mutual Re&s;olution to forget in each
other, the Appearance of every Thing, that has been
di&s;ta&s;teful to either, agrees, I am &s;ure, with the Af|fection,
I feel for you, at my Heart, where it is
founded on a natural Strength, both of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and
<HI>Inclination.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Caveat</HI> began, originally, with the Vi&s;ion: I
added not, till after it was fini&s;h'd, tho&s;e Lines,
among which are the unlucky Ones, that di&s;pleas'd
you. I was &s;carful, le&s;t, without &s;omething of that
kind, by way of Introduction, the Reader might
think him&s;elf pu&s;h'd, too abruptly, into the Alle|gory:
But, I confe&s;s, it was unrea&s;onable in me to
cover your <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> which I delighted in, under the
Veil of an Allegory; and explain my <HI>Cen&s;ure,</HI> too
openly, in which I could take no Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I lov'd you &s;o well, and thought
of you &s;o often, that it was not ea&s;y for me, in any
<PB N="46" REF="49">
Humour, to write Ver&s;e, and not dwell upon you.&mdash;Have you never been <HI>jealous</HI> of a favourite <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s?</HI>&mdash;Have you never, under a <HI>Pique,</HI> at her &s;uppos'd
<HI>Neglect,</HI> &s;aid, what &s;he could no more de&s;erve, than
you could think &s;he did, upon cooler Reflection?&mdash;And have you not found, after all, that you was
never the le&s;s her <HI>Lover?</HI></P>
<P>Your Offer is very kind, to prevail on the Editor
of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> to leave out the Note, or declare,
that I was not meant in it; But I am &s;atisfied:&mdash;It is over;&mdash;and de&s;erves no more of your Appli|cation.</P>
<P>I agree with you, It is <HI>Morality</HI> makes us belov'd:
I know it, from the Effect of your Writings; where
I <HI>but admire</HI> the Harmony, and the Elegance, while
I <HI>love</HI> the Genero&s;ity, and the Candor of the Senti|ments.
I prefer too, as you do, <HI>Friend&s;hips,</HI> and
the hone&s;t Enjoyments of Life, to <HI>Fame,</HI> and noi&s;y
<HI>Prai&s;es</HI>; but I am glad you are happier, than you wi&s;h
to be, who enjoy both Benefits, together.</P>
<P>Yet, if there was nothing de&s;irable in <HI>Fame,</HI> there
could be nothing dete&s;table in <HI>Slander</HI>; and your
hone&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, at being <HI>thought</HI> wor&s;e than you
<HI>are,</HI> would, in that Ca&s;e, be in Danger of pa&s;&s;ing for
a <HI>Weakne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I know, however, that you con&s;ider <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> in a
nobler Light than <HI>Vanity.</HI>&mdash;There is, in Fame, the
Promulgation of a good Man's Example, which his
natural Life being too &s;hort to extend &s;o far as he
wi&s;hes, <HI>That</HI> Defect is &s;upplied by the &s;econd Life,
he receives, from his <HI>Memory.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een, and been a&s;ham'd of that low Turn,
which Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> gave, to your Good-nature.&mdash;Where a Man's <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> are too &s;trong for his <HI>Vir|tues,</HI>
his <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> will be too hard for his <HI>Prudence:</HI>
He has often been weak enough to treat you in a
Manner that moves too much Indignation again&s;t
Him&s;elf, not to leave it unnece&s;&s;ary for you, al&s;o, to
<PB N="47" REF="50">
puni&s;h him.&mdash;Neither of us would chu&s;e him for a
<HI>Friend</HI>; but none of the <HI>Frailties</HI> of his <HI>Temper,</HI> any
more than the heavy <HI>Formalities</HI> of his <HI>Style,</HI> can pre|vent
your acknowledging, there is often <HI>Weight,</HI> in
his <HI>Arguments</HI>; and <HI>Matter,</HI> that de&s;erves Encourage|ment,
to be met with, in his <HI>Writings.</HI></P>
<P>I will &s;oon, Sir, convince you, that my Sen&s;ibility
is not &s;o tender, as you &s;uppo&s;e it to be: I am &s;o far
from an Inclination to defend &s;ome <HI>Pieces,</HI> which I
was too much a Boy, when I publi&s;h'd, that I em|brace
all Occa&s;ions of expo&s;ing 'em, my&s;elf, to the
Contempt they have merited.</P>
<P>I am already too much oblig'd, not to blu&s;h at your
Mention of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> with a View of &s;ending it to
my Daughter; and <HI>She</HI> is too inquifitive a Lover of
what gives her <HI>In&s;truction</HI> with <HI>Delight,</HI> to have been
&s;atisfied without finding, in her Clo&s;et, whatever &s;he
had heard <HI>you</HI> had publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>As a Proof, how determin'd I am, to throw no|thing
upon the World, that may give you Cau&s;e of
Complaint, I will &s;end you, in Manu&s;cript, the <HI>E&s;&s;ay
on Propriety,</HI> as &s;oon as it is fini&s;h'd: I do the &s;ame,
now, by a &s;maller Piece, I am about to publi&s;h, be|cau&s;e

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. From Mr. HILL, To Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 17. 1738.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>THE Plea&s;ure, I was &s;ure to receive with your
Letter, brought an unexpected Chagrin in its
Company, from a Vein of civil Reproach, that runs
thro' it; which I can better di&s;cern, than account
for; &s;ince I mu&s;t not &s;u&s;pect, without wronging my
<PB N="48" REF="51">
Ideas of your Equity, that you could be di&s;pleas'd at
the Freedom I took in my Sentiments. If I believ'd
they had given you the &s;malle&s;t Offence, I would ra|ther
commit my E&s;&s;ay, in its pre&s;ent rough State, to
the Flames, than tran&s;cribe it, either for your&s;elf, or
the Publick.</P>
<P>Indeed it was with a kind of foreboding Reluctance
that I cen&s;ur'd any Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>yours</HI>; and to confe&s;s
the Truth, frankly, I had only one Rea&s;on for doing
it. After I had convinc'd my&s;elf, thoroughly, that
<HI>Propriety,</HI> in &s;ome of the Lights I was con&s;idering it
under, had been univer&s;ally neglected, in Poetry, I
fore&s;aw, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h the Belief
of a Fact &s;o unlikely, without citing the &s;tronge&s;t
<HI>Examples:</HI>&mdash;To do this, from the Works of our
<HI>dead</HI> Authors only, carry'd the Face of a <HI>Meanne&s;s,</HI>
I could not tell how to &s;ubmit to.&mdash;To draw formal
Citations from any Pieces that had appear'd of my
own (tho' full enough, God knows, of Ab&s;urdities,
to have furni&s;h'd more Proofs than I wanted), would
have look'd too a&s;&s;uming, and &s;illy:&mdash;To borrow &s;uch
In&s;tances out of other, le&s;s faulty, Cotemporaries, not
however reputed among the &s;parkling great Lumi|naries
of Wit, would have induc'd a mi&s;taken Con|clu&s;ion,
that, in the Works of more ma&s;terly Writers,
there were no &s;uch <HI>Examples</HI> to be met with.&mdash;And
now,&mdash;Is there a good Judge in <HI>England</HI> (except one)
who will not &s;ee, and acknowledge, the Nece&s;&s;ity
that threw me, unavoidably, upon <HI>your</HI> Writings?</P>
<P>However, I am glad, at my Heart, it was Dr.
<HI>A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t</HI> who made that Collection you mention; for
I am almo&s;t unwilling to be found in the <HI>Right,</HI> when
I di&s;approve what <HI>your</HI> Name has been &s;tamp'd on;
yet your own hone&s;t Argument (that it is not enough
to excu&s;e a Reporter of Fal&s;hoods, that he was told,
and believ'd, what he publi&s;h'd) mu&s;t defend me
again&s;t its Advancer: For neither is it a &s;ufficient
Excu&s;e, that a <HI>Writer,</HI> who&s;e Name, in the Front of
<PB N="49" REF="52">
a Book, has given Weight to the Cen&s;ures it propa|gates,
was not <HI>Author</HI> of &s;ome of tho&s;e Cen&s;ures;
&s;ince whatever a Man &s;ets his <HI>Hand</HI> to, he ought, fir&s;t,
to examine the <HI>Truth</HI> of.</P>
<P>I am charm'd, while I hear you di&s;claim that Pro|pen&s;ity
to <HI>Pique</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> which, to &s;peak with
the Soul of a Friend, &s;eems, to me, the only <HI>Spot</HI> on
your Character.&mdash;We are, All of us, in &s;ome Lights,
or other, the <HI>Dupes</HI> of our natural Frailties: And
when Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with the Warmth that becomes a
great Mind, tells me how far he is from de&s;pi&s;ing De|fects
in Men's <HI>Genius,</HI>&mdash;never feeling any Contempt
but for the Dirt of their <HI>Actions</HI>; I am &s;ure he &s;ays
nothing but what he firmly believes to be true. And
yet there are Pieces, well known to be <HI>his,</HI> many
Pa&s;&s;ages whereof no Man, le&s;s appris'd than him&s;elf
of his Heart's &s;ecret Views and Intentions, can read,
without being &s;trongly convinc'd of a Scorn, that re|gards
<HI>Genius</HI> only: Tho', if he loves you but half &s;o
&s;incerely as I do, you have no &s;ooner di&s;avow'd the
De&s;ign, than he concludes, the Imputation was
groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, 'tis Pity that a Thinker, &s;o
humane and benevolent, &s;hould indulge an Ambi|guity,
in the Turn of his Expre&s;&s;ion, that &s;catters
Gall, which his Heart never licens'd; &s;ince I believe
it a general Truth, that Men, of the opene&s;t and ho|ne&s;te&s;t
Natures, &s;ooner catch Fire at <HI>Contempt,</HI> than
<HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;And, as to any <HI>Dirtine&s;s</HI> in Actions
which take Birth from Effect of &s;uch Influence, we
may conclude, from tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible little Sallies of
<HI>Fury,</HI> whereby, even among unde&s;igning and innocent
Infants, we &s;ee <HI>Brother</HI> precipitated into Outrage
again&s;t <HI>Brother,</HI> immediately upon any cold Provo|cation
of <HI>Scorn,</HI> that there is nothing <HI>immoral</HI> in
what may be done, or declar'd, too offen&s;ively, under
Impre&s;&s;ions &s;o violent, &s;o involuntary, and natural.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">
After all this grave Face of Apology, I am an ab|&s;olute
Stranger to the <HI>Grounds</HI> upon which tho&s;e
Men, you refer to, proceeded.&mdash;Nay, I am &s;o, for
the mo&s;t part, even to the <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> by which they
provok'd you: All the Rea&s;on, indeed, that I have
for giving you any of <HI>my</HI> Thoughts on the Subject, is
deriv'd from your own &s;tarting into it (a little di|gre&s;&s;ively)
immediately after hinting &s;ome Occa&s;ions
you had to lament, that I knew you le&s;s ju&s;tly, as a
<HI>Man,</HI> than a <HI>Poet.</HI>&mdash;I will appeal to impartial Po&s;te|rity,
whether I do not know you much better, in
both Lights, than ten thou&s;and of tho&s;e pretending
<HI>E&s;teemers,</HI> of who&s;e Affection you think your&s;elf
&s;urer. It will never be in my <HI>Will,</HI> nor my <HI>Power,</HI>
to tran&s;mit &s;uch a <HI>Picture,</HI> as yours, without its be&s;t,
and mo&s;t beautiful <HI>Likene&s;s:</HI> I &s;hall leave to duller
<HI>Dutch</HI> Painters in Critici&s;m, their unenvied Delight,
to draw <HI>Mon&s;ters.</HI> And know very well, for my own
Part, that I &s;hould but <HI>di&s;grace</HI> the de&s;ir'd Reputation
of my <HI>Pencil,</HI> if I mi&s;s'd the <HI>Re&s;emblance,</HI> too widely,
in a Piece which mu&s;t expect to be compar'd with
Originals of the &s;ame, by many different <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I acquit you of any further Allu&s;ion to <HI>me,</HI>
than by that retro&s;pect Glance, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> I have,
<HI>affectionately,</HI> caught the Occa&s;ion of pointing out, to
one of the lea&s;t intentionally guilty among Men, a
&s;eeming <HI>Tartne&s;s</HI> of Spirit in him&s;elf, which he will
ea&s;ily <HI>find,</HI> when he looks for; and which, whenever
he does find, and guard again&s;t, by &s;ubmitting his
<HI>Wit</HI> to his <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> he will become the mo&s;t <HI>un|natural</HI>
good Man in the World; for he will leave
him&s;elf not a <HI>Fault,</HI> to be blam'd for!</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, who was born to mix Sin with Re|pentance,
I plead guilty to all &s;uch Indictments as
you, in that Place, <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> to my Memory.&mdash;I was
always too perceptibly quick, in my Apprehen&s;ion of
<HI>Contempts,</HI> or <HI>Indignities:</HI>&mdash;A Temper, which would
have been as <HI>unpardonable,</HI> as I confe&s;s it to be <HI>weak,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="54">
and <HI>&s;elf-mortifying</HI>; but that the Fault, tho' of too
&s;welling a Nature, leaves no Voids for Admi&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Malice.</HI>&mdash;It is an offen&s;ive, indeed, but reconcileable
Imbecillity of Mind: <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> felt, and under&s;tood
it, very finely.<Q><L>" It carries <HI>Anger,</HI> as the Flint does <HI>Fire!</HI></L>

<P>Yet I will endeavour to redre&s;s this wrong Bent in

you are &s;o good as to &s;hew me my WANT OF.&mdash;And
thus, in the Commerce of <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> as in Traffick,
le&s;s generous, there is offer'd a mutual Exchange
of Advantages:&mdash;Something, always, to <HI>give</HI> and to
<HI>gain:</HI> And this makes <HI>both Sides</HI> more rich, and more
&s;atisfy'd.&mdash;What a Lo&s;s, then, have un&s;ocial and
vain Di&s;po&s;itions, which, by a &s;ullen Seclu&s;ion from
the&s;e Rights of Reproof, and Plain-dealing, cut off
all the kind U&s;e of Correction!&mdash;<HI>Human Nature,</HI> let
it be as &s;u&s;ceptible of <HI>Grace</HI> as it can, never yet
wanted <HI>Pride</HI> enough to make Mortifications, of this

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>IT is Time to relieve you from Subjects, and
Lengths, like my la&s;t; yet you will hardly &s;u&s;pect
&s;uch a Blindne&s;s, in my bad Under&s;tanding, as to
think, I di&s;tingui&s;h not the true <HI>Ca&s;t</HI> of &s;ome Colours
which you need not have held quite &s;o near me.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all which, if I had not more Cau&s;e to
di&s;tru&s;t it, on <HI>your</HI> Side, than my <HI>own,</HI> I &s;hould flatter
my&s;elf, we were born to be <HI>Lovers</HI>; we are &s;o often,
and &s;o unaccountably, mi&s;taking one another into <HI>Re|&s;erves,</HI>
and <HI>Re&s;entments!</HI> Yet I am &s;orry, whenever
this happens, becau&s;e the mo&s;t <HI>lo&s;t</HI> Time, in Mens
Lives, is <HI>that</HI> which they wa&s;te in <HI>Expo&s;tulation.</HI>
They, who are <HI>Friends,</HI> find it <HI>&s;elfi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>diffident</HI>&mdash;and
between <HI>Enemies 'tis inflaming,</HI> and <HI>fruitle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there would be no End of &s;uch&mdash;what mu&s;t
I call 'em?&mdash;<HI>Eclairci&s;&s;ements</HI> is an affected <HI>French</HI>
Word, and I am heartily &s;orry I <HI>want</HI> it.&mdash;In plain
<HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I always did, and I &s;till do, mo&s;t
affectionately <HI>e&s;teem</HI> you, both as <HI>Man,</HI> and as <HI>Poet:</HI>
And if now-and-then, for a Start, I have been put
<PB N="53" REF="56">
out of Humour with <HI>either,</HI> I would fain have you
think, it was no le&s;s your <HI>own</HI> Fault, than <HI>mine:</HI> At
lea&s;t, I am &s;ure, I believ'd &s;o. And if, whenever
you &s;uppos'd me to have acted incon&s;i&s;tently with my|&s;elf,
on that Principle, you had only been &s;o kind, as
to have declar'd <HI>why</HI> you thought &s;o, I would openly,
and immediately, either have demon&s;trated the <HI>Mi&s;|take</HI>
to be <HI>yours,</HI> or confe&s;s'd, and abhorr'd, my <HI>own
Error.</HI>&mdash;I will always &s;tand <HI>bound</HI> to give, if not a
<HI>rational,</HI> yet a <HI>moral,</HI> Account of my <HI>Actions:</HI> Not
alone, as they regard Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> but <HI>Men,</HI> in the re|mote&s;t
Situation below him: And whoever (let him
be accus'd, either by Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion or Calumny)
would <HI>decline</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of his <HI>Conduct</HI> in Life, is &s;o
far from being worthy your <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> that he is a
<HI>Stranger</HI> to both <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Here, then, let us <HI>re&s;t</HI> this Debate; and either re|&s;olve
to let <HI>fall</HI> an unconfiding, and cold Corre&s;pond|ence,
or much rather agree (if you plea&s;e) to under|&s;tand
one another <HI>better,</HI> for the future.&mdash;As to my
own Part, I never <HI>will</HI>&mdash;I never <HI>did</HI>&mdash;di&s;oblige you,
<HI>unprovok'd.</HI> And if, how unkindly &s;oever impell'd, I

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>HAVING &s;een a Letter you wrote to my
Friend Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t, tho' I
cannot boa&s;t the Honour and Happine&s;s of your Ac|quaintance,
and ought with the utmo&s;t Deference
and Veneration to approach &s;o &s;upreme a Genius;
yet my full Heart is not to be repre&s;s'd by Forma|lities;
and you mu&s;t allow me the Plea&s;ure of pour|ing
forth my be&s;t Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>I will not affect a moderate Joy at your Appro|bation,
your Prai&s;e: It plea&s;es, it delights, it ravi&s;hes
me! Forgive me for the Lowne&s;s of the Truth,
when I vow, I'd rather have it than the Acclama|tions
of Thou&s;ands: 'Tis &s;o &s;incere, &s;o delicate, &s;o
di&s;tingui&s;hing, &s;o glowing, and, what peculiarly marks
and endears it, &s;o beautifully generous.</P>
<P>That great Mind, and tran&s;cendent Humanity,
that appear in the Te&s;timony you have been pleas'd
to give my fir&s;t Attempt, would have utterly con|founded
me, if I had not been prepar'd for &s;uch an
Entertainment, by your well-known Character;
which the Voice of Fame, and your own ma&s;terly
Writings, loudly proclaim.</P>
<P>It would both be di&s;ingenuous, and rudely unju&s;t,
in me, after what you have ob&s;erv'd, to di&s;&s;emble my
Satisfaction at &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in the Poem: This let
me &s;ay, that your Reflections have enter'd into the
very Soul of my Purpo&s;e, and, even to my&s;elf, ca&s;t a
Light over the Whole.</P>
<P>How rare, how happy, is it to find a Judge who&s;e
di&s;cerning Goodne&s;s overlooks the Faults of what is
<PB N="56" REF="59">
well meant, at the &s;ame Time that his fine enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
Ta&s;te improves the Beauties!</P>
<P>To you, alone, it belongs, to write &s;o inimitably,
and to read &s;o indulgently.</P>
<P>If I wrote all that my Admiration of your Per|fections,
and my Gratitude, dictate, I &s;hould never
have done; but, left I tire you, I'll for the pre&s;ent
rather put a Violence on my&s;elf: Only let me che|ri&s;h
one Hope further&mdash;of being, &s;ome time or other,
admitted into the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and entertaining
Company in the World. I am, with the greate&s;t

<P>I Receiv'd yours with a Soul awaken'd all to Joy,
Gratitude, and Ambition. There is &s;uch a noble
Excellence of Mind, &s;o much uncommon Goodne&s;s,
and Genero&s;ity of Heart, in every thing you &s;ay, as
at once charms and a&s;toni&s;hes me.</P>
<P>As you think, imagine, and write, with a diviner
Warmth, &s;uperior to the re&s;t of Mankind; &s;o the
very Prai&s;es, you be&s;tow, bear the Stamp of Emi|nence,
and reflect &s;tronger on your&s;elf.</P>
<P>While I meditate your encouraging Lines, for a
while, I forget the Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Degeneracy, and
Cruelty of Men, and &s;eem to be a&s;&s;ociated with
better and more exalted Beings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Social Love,</HI> of which you are &s;o bright an
Example, tho' it be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Ornament of
Humanity, yet there are &s;ome ill-natur'd enough to
<PB N="57" REF="60">
degrade it into a Modification of Self-love, according
to them, its Original.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen, I am afraid, mingle their
Tempers too much with their Speculations.</P>
<P>Self-love is, indeed, indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the
Well-being of every Individual, but carries not along
with it an Idea of moral Beauty and Perfection;
whereas Social Love is of quite another Nature; the
ju&s;t and free Exerci&s;e of which, in a particular man|ner,
renders one amiable, and divine. The accom|pli&s;h'd
Man I admire, the hone&s;t Man I tru&s;t; but
'tis only the truly-generous Man I intirely love. Hu|manity
is the very Smile and Con&s;ummation of Vir|tue;
'tis the Image of that fair Perfection, in the Su|preme
Being, which, while he was infinitely happy
in him&s;elf, mov'd him to create a World of Beings to
make them &s;o.</P>
<P>The Excellent ones of the Earth, in the Exerci&s;e
of Social Love, feel it as much to be an original Im|pul&s;e,
as the low World that blind Affection, they
bear them&s;elves; nor are they, in the lea&s;t, con&s;cious
of that forc'd, cold Rea&s;oning, by which it is deduc'd
from &s;o mean an Original.</P>
<P>How many deathle&s;s Heroes, Patriots, and Mar|tyrs,
have been &s;o gloriou&s;ly concern'd for the Good
of Mankind, and &s;o &s;trongly actuated by Social Love,
as frequently to act in direct Contradiction to that of
Self?</P>
<P>A great many more Arguments might be adduced
to prove, that Social Love is a nobler, independent
Principle, by it&s;elf, were not the &s;ecret Sen&s;e, that
every good Man has of the Matter, in&s;tead of a
thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Your Writings, while they glow with innumerable
In&s;tances of &s;trong Thinking, and &s;ublime Imagina|tion,
are peculiarly mark'd with this beautiful Bene|volence
of Mind; and 'tis that which, at this time,
has awaken'd, in me, the&s;e Reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">
I am ravi&s;h'd with the Hope, you give me, of your

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>April 27. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>WHEN I reflect how truly happy I was,
Ye&s;terday, in your Company, it is impo&s;|&s;ible
for me to re&s;train my Sen&s;e of it, from breaking
out into this Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>There is, in your Conver&s;ation, &s;uch a Beauty,
Truth, Force, and Elegance of Thought, and Ex|pre&s;&s;ion;
&s;uch animated, fine Sen&s;e, and cha&s;tis'd
Fancy; &s;o much Dignity and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Subli|mity
and Sweetne&s;s; in a Word, &s;uch a Variety of
Entertainment and In&s;truction, as is beyond all Ad|miration.</P>
<P>Your Smiles have all the encouraging Power of
Humanity in them: What one &s;ays, is receiv'd with
great Ta&s;te, and Indulgence; and to li&s;ten to you,
gives one a &s;ecret, and more ravi&s;hing Plea&s;ure, than
to be Author of the be&s;t Things in other Company.</P>
<P>There is downright In&s;piration in your Society: It
enlarges and exalts all the Powers of the Soul, cha&s;es
every low Thought, throws the Pa&s;&s;ions into the mo&s;t
agreeable Agitations, and gives the Heart the mo&s;t
affecting Sentiments&mdash;'Tis moral Harmony!</P>
<P>It gives me an additional Plea&s;ure, to reflect how
ju&s;tly pleas'd, too, Mr. <HI>Savage</HI> was.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">
Nothing is, to me, a &s;tronger In&s;tance of the un|improvable
Nature of that unhappy Creature of whom
you &s;peak &s;o compa&s;&s;ionately, notwith&s;tanding of the
barbarous Provocation he has given you, than his re|maining
bleak, and wither'd, under the Influences of
your Conver&s;ation&mdash;a certain Sign of a Field that the
Lord has curs'd.</P>
<P>There is none that renders human Nature more
amiable than you; and, at the &s;ame time, none that
renders the greate&s;t Part of it more contemptible:
And to de&s;cend from your Company, and mingle
with the Herd of Mankind, is like <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s
de&s;cending from a Throne, to graze with the Bea&s;ts of
the Field.</P>
<P>Now I fea&s;t on Reflection&mdash;and am like a poor
Man, that has brought as much from a rich Enter|tainment
with him, as mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain him for many Days
afterwards.</P>
<P>What charms and amu&s;es me, in a particular
Manner, is, the Account you gave us of that little
Seraph, the young <HI>Urania!</HI> Her elegant Turn of
Mind; her Innocence, and Goodne&s;s, in the Choice
of her Subjects; her Fancy, Judgment, and Ambi|tion,
above her Years; and the beautiful Struggle of
the la&s;t ('tis unfair to call it Vanity), occa&s;ion'd by
the rude Stupidity of the <HI>School-Boy,</HI> are mo&s;t agree|ably
&s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>What you, obligingly, ob&s;erv'd of good Com|pany's
being <HI>Ario&s;to</HI>'s Fountain of Thir&s;t, is remark|ably
true of yours&mdash;I &s;hall long impatiently for the

<OPENER><DATELINE>Oldman's Coffee-hou&s;e, <DATE>May 24. 1726.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HOPE that your uncommon Goodne&s;s will
forgive me, what I &s;carcely can forgive my&s;elf,
my not having, hitherto, an&s;wer'd the la&s;t encou|raging
Letter, and Copy of Ver&s;es, you honour'd me
with.</P>
<P>The Approbation which, out of the Fulne&s;s of a
beneficent Heart, you are pleas'd to give me, I am
fond and ambitious of, next to that of <HI>Heaven:</HI> 'Tis
my be&s;t Reward for what I have done, and a noble
Incitement to go on. When <HI>you</HI> approve, my whole
Soul is awak'd, and charm'd.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ing is your Prai&s;e, but &s;evere is your Satire:
'Tis particularly mark'd with exalted Sentiment, and
generous Contempt. There is a Force in it, that
&s;trikes thro' the Heart; and a Maje&s;ty, not to be ex|pre&s;s'd.
In a Word, it is the unaffected Re&s;entment
of a great Mind.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, in the Compa&s;s of this Let|ter,
to &s;ay how much I admire every particular Line;
yet 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible for me to re&s;train my&s;elf from
dwelling on &s;ome.
<Q><L>" Smile at your vani&s;h'd Hope&mdash;convinc'd, too
late,</L>
<L>" That Greatne&s;s dwells not, always, with the
Great."</L></Q>
I feel the fir&s;t Line, too &s;en&s;ibly; and the la&s;t finely
in&s;inuates the Ab&s;urdity of vulgar and hereditary
Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Your &s;inking of the Lord's unla&s;ting Name in the
Depth of Time, is plea&s;ingly and nobly ju&s;t: Sir <HI>John
Fal&s;taff</HI> &s;unk not with greater Alacrity, in a literal
Sen&s;e, than they and all their Fopperies do in a meta|phorical.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">
I never read any thing more glorious, than the four
following Lines.
<Q><L>" Patrons are <HI>Nature</HI>'s Nobles, not the <HI>State</HI>'s;</L>
<L>" And Wit's a Title, no <HI>Broad Seal</HI> creates.</L>
<L>" Kings, from who&s;e Bounty Wealth's chief Cur|rents
flow,</L>
<L>" Are <HI>poor</HI> in Pow'r, when they would <HI>Souls</HI>
be&s;tow."</L></Q>
They are the mo&s;t divine Triumph of Merit, and
Virtue, that was ever writ. The be&s;t way of di&s;|playing
all their Beauties is, to read them a thou&s;and
and a thou&s;and Times over.</P>
<P>Your De&s;cription of the Court-haunting, Wink|ob&s;erving
Bard, is &s;o natural, that, if I am not mi&s;|taken,
it may be found a Picture of &s;ome living Ori|ginals.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Paragraph is very &s;trongly and delicately
wrought off; but &s;o favourable to me, as obliges me
to &s;uppre&s;s all Sentiments, &s;ave &s;uch as flow from
Gratitude; with which my Heart is as full, as yours
is with Goodne&s;s and Perfection.</P>
<P>You have given me <HI>Fame</HI>; and what have I to
return you, but the Acknowledgment of a grateful
Soul?</P>
<P>How powerfully was I charm'd with the four Acts
of <HI>Elfrid,</HI> you were &s;o conde&s;cendingly good as to
read us! There is in them &s;uch a rich A&s;&s;emblage of
all the Excellencies of the be&s;t Poetry, as is not any|where
to be found. I never met, before, with &s;uch
a Force, and Dignity of Pa&s;&s;ion. My Heart trembles,
yet, when I reflect. But I will not cramp my Ad|miration
into the &s;mall Space this Letter allows.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI> is now gone into the Country, where
he ju&s;tly expects to be va&s;tly entertain'd, and in|&s;tructed,
by your Corre&s;pondence. I have been &s;ome|what
melancholy &s;ince his Departure, touch'd with
<PB N="62" REF="65">
the&s;e pen&s;ive Emotions, parting with &s;uch a Friend
gives.</P>
<Q><L>Bounteous Creator of the tender Heart!</L>
<L>Is there no World, where Friends &s;hall never part?</L>
<L>Be that our future Lot, and of &s;uch Bli&s;s</L>
<L>Grant us an Earne&s;t, ere we die, in this.</L></Q>
<P>I go, on <HI>Saturday</HI> next, to re&s;ide at Mr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s

to a young Gentleman there.</P>
<P>Since you have been pleas'd to rai&s;e me, in &s;ome

never fall from it, but frequently be allow'd the Ho|nour

<P>ENcourag'd by that mo&s;t divine of all Virtues,

<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> la&s;t I wrote to you, from a Coffee-hou&s;e
in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but had the Misfortune to hear
you were gone out, only Half an Hour, before the
Letter was &s;ent.</P>
<P>Flattering my&s;elf, then, with &s;ome Hopes of your

on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, from Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> to be pre|fix'd
to the Second Edition of <HI>Winter</HI>; and which I
&s;end you inclos'd. That you &s;hould read them, was
his particular De&s;ire, in the following Terms:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Offer my Ver&s;es to Mr. <HI>Hill</HI>'s Peru&s;al, and tell
him, that I will not determine their Fate, till I fir&s;t
learn his Opinion of them: For I know him too
nobly &s;incere, to indulge <HI>my</HI> Vanity, at the Expence
of <HI>your</HI> Credit. Say, likewi&s;e, that I will &s;hortly
venture to make u&s;e of that Permi&s;&s;ion he &s;o ge|nerou&s;ly
granted me, of writing to him, as often as
my Fear of becoming trouble&s;ome will let me."&mdash;</Q>
All that I &s;hall ob&s;erve concerning them, to &s;uch a
fini&s;h'd Judge as you are, is, that their only glo|rious
Fault, if they have any, is, an Exce&s;s of that
beautiful Benevolence of Mind, which, among a
thou&s;and other Things, make you and him &s;o greatly

<P>I hinted to you in my la&s;t, that, on <HI>Saturday</HI>
Morning, I was with Sir <HI>Spencer Compton.</HI> A certain
Gentleman, without my De&s;ire, &s;poke to him con|cerning
me; his An&s;wer was, that I had never come
near him: Then the Gentleman put the Que&s;tion, if
he de&s;ir'd that I &s;hould wait on him; he return'd, he
<PB N="64" REF="67">
did: On this, the Gentleman gave me an introductory
Letter to him. He receiv'd me in what they com|monly
call a civil Manner, a&s;k'd me &s;ome Common|place
Que&s;tions, and made me a Pre&s;ent of Twenty
Guineas. I am very ready to own, that the Pre&s;ent
was larger than my Performance de&s;erv'd; and &s;hall
a&s;cribe it to his Genero&s;ity, or any other Cau&s;e, ra|ther
than the Merit of the Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>As the Ca&s;e now is, one of your infinite Delicacy
will be the be&s;t Judge, whether it will be proper to
print the&s;e two inimitable Copies of Ver&s;es I have
from you, and Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> without &s;uch little Alter|ations
as &s;hall clear Sir <HI>Spencer</HI> of that be&s;t Satire I
ever read. I &s;hall &s;ay no more on that Head; for if
there be any Rea&s;ons for &s;uch Alterations, you will,
of Nece&s;&s;ity, at one Glance, &s;ee them in the &s;tronge&s;t

find that the Ca&s;e requir'd &s;ome &s;mall Alterations,
and yet not indulge me with them, I &s;hall reckon
what my Patron gave me, a fatal Pre&s;ent.&mdash;'Tis a

you lately favour'd him with, by which I had

<P>It is with a Mixture of Joy, Pride, and Confu&s;ion,
I read the favourable. Mention you were pleas'd to
make of me: What unu&s;ual good Fortune has thus
intitled me to your kind Regard? 'Tis nothing, &s;ure,

your Return: To me your Ab&s;ence would be much
&s;everer, if my partial Sympathy in the Happine&s;s of
my native Country did not alleviate the Misfortune.
I congratulate her on the Pre&s;ence of &s;uch a kind In|&s;pirer,
and candid Ob&s;erver: <HI>There,</HI> you may chance
to find, in that neglected Corner of the World, de|pre&s;s'd
Merit, uninform'd Beauty, and good Sen&s;e

<P>Nothing has appear'd in Print here, &s;ince your De|parture,

Beings of a Summer's Night! who&s;e only Merit is
the violent Propen&s;ion with which they tend into Ob|livion.
Memory abhors them, and their E&s;&s;ence is,
to die. I beg Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Pardon, &s;ome of who&s;e
Letters, to Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> were &s;urreptitiou&s;ly printed

De&s;ign is to re&s;tore primitive Chri&s;tianity; and his
hopeful Candidates are all the Beaus, and pretty

<P>You were, a Week or two ago, traduc'd by the

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been almo&s;t intirely in the Country, &s;ince
I had the Honour of yours, and of the inclos'd
Papers, you were &s;o good, as to &s;end me. The two or
three Days &s;ince my Return to Town have been ra|ther
hurry'd than employ'd in &s;olliciting for the Be|nefit
of old <HI>Dennis.</HI> Your well-known and for|merly-experienc'd
Goodne&s;s will, I hope, forgive
me for having been &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as to keep your Papers &s;o
long. Tho' I would have had &s;ome Objections to
your undertaking the Tran&s;lation of <HI>Zaire</HI>; now
that it is &s;o affectingly done, I &s;hould be very un|grateful,
for the great Plea&s;ure it has given me, to
think of them any more. In reading of <HI>Zara,</HI> I
forget what it was that I objected to <HI>Zaire.</HI> You have
heighten'd it with mere Imagination, but &s;uch a
cha&s;tis'd one, as accords perfectly well with the nobler
Fervency of the Heart. The Sentiments and Re|flections,
too, ri&s;e in the Tran&s;lation, and glow
&s;tronger, as well as the Touches of the poetical Pen|cil.
Allow me to &s;ay, that, in the&s;e Re&s;pects, I
deeply feel the Difference betwixt Mr. <HI>Voltaire</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Hill.</HI> The more generous Warmth of your
Heart more animates the Scene, rai&s;es the dear Tu|mult
in the Brea&s;t, and moves me much more. I
ob&s;erv'd nothing that I wi&s;h'd alter'd but a Word
here and there, which are mere Trifles, and not
worth Regard. One, however, I will take the Li|berty
to mention: It is in a Speech of the fir&s;t Scene,
which marks the Civility and Gallantry of <HI>France</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Where
Men adore <HI>their Wives</HI>"</Q>&mdash;The two la&s;t
Words I would change into&mdash;<HI>the Fair.</HI>&mdash;I imagine
you &s;miling at my important Critici&s;m, and ready to
reply&mdash;that tho' the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> are not famous
<PB N="71" REF="74">
for adoring their Wives, yet tho&s;e in the good old
unrefin'd Days of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> might. If they do not
now adore their Wives, they perhaps do better, they
make them ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long to renew the Plea&s;ure your Play has
given me at its Repre&s;entation. What Attention I
can contribute to the promoting of that, will greatly
be its own Reward. Mr. <HI>Dodington</HI> is expected, in a
few Days, from <HI>Ireland:</HI> He, I dare &s;ay, will warmly
favour it, from a double Cau&s;e&mdash;both the Love of the
fine Arts, and his own Plea&s;ure. Had you but Players
equal to tho&s;e <HI>Voltaire</HI> had, I would not doubt, in this
In&s;tance, the Ta&s;te of our Countrymen&mdash;Almighty
Nature is every-where the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Soon I propo&s;e to fix in Town for the Winter,
during which time I hope to pa&s;s &s;everal happy Even|ings
in your Company: Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> earne&s;tly wi&s;hes

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Aug. 23. 1735.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>UPON my Return to Town, from Mr. <HI>Do|dington</HI>'s
Seat in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> where I had for
&s;ome time been, I found your Letter, about a Month
after its Date: Had it been &s;ent me in the Country,
I could not have neglected, till now, acknowledging
the Plea&s;ure it, and the Packet of Prompters you &s;ent
along with it, gave me. Tho' very happy in the
Company where I then was, yet cannot I help &s;in|cerely
regretting the Lo&s;s of that Entertainment to
which you was &s;o good as to give me an Invitation.
With the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure would I have beheld, and
<PB N="72" REF="75">
with the greate&s;t Zeal would I have countenanc'd, to
the utmo&s;t of my little Power, the Revival of <HI>Action,</HI>
which &s;eems on all our Theatres to be now both dead
and rotten. A Friend of mine, who was there, did
not, by what he told me, &s;often my Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I was very much enlighten'd and warm'd by the
Prompters upon <HI>Action:</HI> They pre&s;ent no le&s;s a
&s;trong and beautiful Idea of what <HI>Actors</HI> ought to be,
than a mortifying one of what they are. As the
Stage is a powerful School of humane polite Morality,
&s;o nothing can contribute more to barbarize the Age
than the pre&s;ent Condition of ours. There, human
Nature is repre&s;ented in as aukward, fal&s;e, and mon|&s;trous
a Manner, as the human Form was in antient
<HI>Gothic</HI> Sculpture and Painting. If that were all, it
might be laugh'd at, and contemn'd: But &s;ince it
tends, at the &s;ame time, to confound the Head, and
corrupt the Heart; &s;ince Crouds grow &s;tupid, or
barbarous, as they gaze; who can con&s;ider it in that
View, without feeling an hone&s;t Indignation? And
what crowns the Misfortune is, that there is no Hope
of its ever being otherwi&s;e: The Root of the Evil
lies too deep to be pluck'd up. Was there ever an
equal Ab&s;urdity heard of, among a civiliz'd People?
That &s;uch an important public Diver&s;ion, the School
which forms the Manners of the Age, &s;hould be made
the Property of private Per&s;ons; who, did they hap|pen
in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, by an infinite Chance, to be
Judges of the Matter, yet may transfer that Property
to the mo&s;t profligate, ta&s;tele&s;s, and ignorant of Man|kind!
But this, alas! is only one of the Pillars of
that va&s;t Temple of <HI>Corruption,</HI> under which this Ge|neration,
more than any other that ever boa&s;ted
Freedom, wor&s;hips the dirty, low-minded, in&s;a|tiable
Idol of Self-intere&s;t. Even to this Idol is
every public Work, which we have the Soul to at|tempt,
made an immediate Sacrifice.&mdash;You &s;ee how
much your <HI>Prompters</HI> have inflam'd me; and the
<PB N="73" REF="76">
melancholy Conclu&s;ion I draw from all is, that I
never hope to &s;ee Gentlemen of equal Genius, Ta&s;te,
Judgment, and Genero&s;ity of Heart, to the Author
of the&s;e Prompters, at the Head of our Theatres. I
may, however, very well live to &s;ee all Poetry re|duced
to Magazine-Mi&s;cellanies, all Plays to Mum|mery
Entertainments, and, in &s;hort, all Learning
ab&s;orb'd into the Sink of hireling &s;currilous News-Papers.
Pardon this Suppo&s;ition in a Letter to one,
who, while he I ves, will never &s;uffer it wholly to
take Place: In the mean time, go on to &s;tem the
Torrent of Barbari&s;m. I wi&s;h you could find an

<P>IT is far from being the want of a due Sen&s;e of
the Honour, your two la&s;t Letters did me, that has
prevented my thanking you for them before now:
The Truth is, they plung'd me &s;o deep into your
Debt, that I was di&s;pirited, thro' mere De&s;pair, of
clearing it. But now I am rather willing to declare
my&s;elf an irrecoverable Bankrupt, than any longer
neglect to acknowledge the refin'd Plea&s;ure, which
your generous Approbation of my late Performance
gives me&mdash;I call it generous, that Epithet having a
peculiar Relation to whatever you do; be&s;ides, I can|not
help being afraid that it mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure,
proceed from &s;o humane a Cau&s;e. In the mean time,
however that be, I will avow, that I am ju&s;tly proud
of, charm'd with, and mo&s;t agreeably rewarded by,
your good Opinion of my Poem. Allow me here,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
by the bye, to remark, that tho' Poets have been
long us'd to this truly-&s;piritual and almo&s;t only Emo|lument
ari&s;ing from their Works; yet I doubt much,
if Book&s;ellers have any manner of Reli&s;h for it: I
think, therefore (notwith&s;tanding that the Gho&s;ts of
many Authors walk unreveng'd), of annulling the
Bargain I made with mine, who would el&s;e be a con|&s;iderable
Lo&s;er, by the Paper, Printing, and Publi|cation,
of <HI>Liberty.</HI> As I &s;hall, in this Ca&s;e, be po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
of the intire Property of it again, I propo&s;e, in
a Year or two hence, to give a new Edition of it;
and beg that you would, ere then, enrich me with
&s;ome Critici&s;ms, which I hope I &s;hall have the Grace
to reli&s;h as well as Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation, with regard to political Cor|ruption,
like natural, when come to a Cri&s;is, pro|ducing
more exalted Scenes of Animation, is fine,
and plea&s;es by the future Pro&s;pect it opens; but it
awakens, at the &s;ame time, a Sentiment no le&s;s mor|tifying,
&s;hould we find our Lot ca&s;t in the Times of
Putrefaction; &s;hould we find our&s;elves devoted, in
an anti-heroic Manner, for the Good of Po&s;terity. I
wi&s;h, heartily, that I could refute what you likewi&s;e
ob&s;erve with regard to the Cau&s;e of this Corruption.
Certainly the kind Exchanger of the Super-abundance
for the Sweets and Elegancies of Life, is it&s;elf cor|rupted,
and its Gifts abus'd, from the want of Ta&s;te:
For whence is it, &s;ave the Want of Ta&s;te, that the
continual Tides of Riches, pour'd in upon this Na|tion
by Commerce, have been lo&s;t again in a Gulph
of ungraceful, inelegant, inglorious Luxury? But
whence, you will &s;ay, this want of Ta&s;te? Whence
this &s;ordid Turn to cautious Time-&s;erving, Money-making,
&s;neaking Prudence, in&s;tead of regardle&s;s,
unfetter'd Virtue? To private Jobs, in&s;tead of public
Works? To profitable, in&s;tead of fine Arts? To
Gain, in&s;tead of Glory? In a Word, to the whole
venal Sy&s;tem of modern Admini&s;tration? And to
<PB N="75" REF="78">
tho&s;e gro&s;s peri&s;hing Luxuries, that reconcile, at once,
Avarice and Profu&s;ion, centering all in Self, and even
in the meane&s;t, the material Part of Self. This
Di&s;qui&s;ition, I am afraid, would very near lead me
back again to your Ob&s;ervation. It mu&s;t be own'd,
however, that the better Genius of this Nation has
often nobly exerted it&s;elf, and will &s;truggle hard be|fore
it expire. With regard to Arts and Learning,
one may venture to &s;ay, that they might yet &s;tand
their Ground, were they but merely protected. In
lieu of all Patrons that have been, are, or will be, in
<HI>England,</HI> I wi&s;h we had one good Act of Parliament
for &s;ecuring to Authors the Property of their own
Works; and that the Stage were put upon the Foot|ing
of common Sen&s;e and Humanity. And can it
be, that tho&s;e who impre&s;s Paper with what con&s;ti|tutes
the be&s;t and everla&s;ting Riches of all civiliz'd
Nations, and of all Ages, &s;hould have le&s;s Property
in the Paper, &s;o enrich'd, than tho&s;e who deal in the
Rags, which make that Paper? Can it be, that the
great, the delightful School of Manners, &s;hould be
abandon'd to common Sale, and become the Pro|perty
of any one, who can purcha&s;e it, to be, per|haps,
the School of Folly, and Corruption?&mdash;A Si|mony
this, in <HI>Virtue</HI>; which, if not &s;o wicked, yet
is as pernicious as that in <HI>Religion.</HI> What would
<HI>Athenians</HI> have &s;aid to this! what Laughter, what
Contempt, what Indignation, would it have rais'd
among them!</P>
<P>Now that I mention the Stage, I mu&s;t &s;till in&s;i&s;t
upon my Copy of that only humane new Entertain|ment
I have &s;een upon it of late. I know not what
<HI>Gothic</HI> Devil po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Maid at my Lodgings, but
my few Books mu&s;t not be &s;o robb'd of the Honour
of boa&s;ting <HI>Zara</HI> among them from its Author.
Having been tantaliz'd lately by &s;eeing you at a Di|&s;tance,
I wi&s;h you would be &s;o good as to make me
Amends &s;ome Evening, and let me know of it a few
<PB N="76" REF="79">

<P>'TIS plain, that Affairs of much greater Con|&s;equence
have prevented your Inquiry about
<HI>York</HI> Stock: I find now how much better you have
employ'd your &s;pare Hours&mdash;You have been at|tempting
to make Mankind what they ought to be:
The Advice you have lately given to &s;uch, who de|&s;erve
the Names of Poet and Patron, is a &s;ufficient
Proof of that public Spirit, which ever <HI>did</HI> and ever
<HI>will</HI> appear in all your Actions.&mdash;Give me Leave to
thank you for the va&s;t Delight I receiv'd in the
Peru&s;al of that daring Flight from the warm Indig|nation
of your Mind&mdash;What an everla&s;ting Reproach
have <HI>you</HI> ju&s;tly thrown upon tho&s;e <HI>Great ones,</HI> whom
Fortune has plac'd high above their Fellow-creatures,
and, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, even above their Superiors!&mdash;A
Panegyric would be a vain Attempt; the Poem it&s;elf
can be&s;t &s;peak its Prai&s;e.&mdash;I confe&s;s, I could not po&s;|&s;ibly
re&s;i&s;t the natural Impul&s;e of expre&s;&s;ing my Tran&s;|port

no Man living has a warmer Regard for the un|common

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAVE with infinite Plea&s;ure fini&s;h'd the read|ing
of your Tragedy: I don't wonder Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
&s;hould &s;ay, upon the Peru&s;al of it, that no Play had
ever <HI>more warm'd</HI> him. I wi&s;h we had a Set of
Actors capable of doing it the Ju&s;tice it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>You were pleas'd to tell me, that you had
Thoughts of my Wife for <HI>Elfrid</HI>; I was appre|hen&s;ive,
not having read it, that the Part might re|quire
great Force, and be too powerful for her Voice:
But I find, 'tis neither long, nor violent; and, as
our Company &s;tands, I think, &s;he might undertake it.</P>
<P>When I told her, you had been pleas'd to name
her for it, &s;he blam'd me for not letting her know it,
that &s;he might have thank'd you for your good Opi|nion
of her. She now de&s;ires me to tell you, &s;he is
highly oblig'd to you, and if you &s;till continue in that
Opinion, &s;he will do you all the Ju&s;tice that lies in
her Power.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Morning.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I HAD an&s;wer'd yours la&s;t Night, but it came to
my Hands as I was dre&s;&s;ing, about Half an Hour
before the Play began.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">
I confe&s;s I am under &s;ome Difficulty, how to ac|count
for the Failure of &s;o good a Play. But not|with&s;tanding
its pre&s;ent Reception, I am po&s;itively,
and ab&s;olutely of Opinion, that after it has &s;lept &s;ome
time, it will appear again upon the Stage, with a
much better Grace, and continue in the Stock in the
fir&s;t Form of Tragedy for ever. My Rea&s;ons for this
are, as follow:</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e to remember, I hinted to you, that
(as the Town has been lately led, and manag'd) there
was a kind of Nece&s;&s;ity to form and prepare a &s;trong
Body to &s;upport even its real Merit in the fir&s;t Run
of it; and I have often thought the be&s;t Tragedy not
&s;upported by this nece&s;&s;ary, &s;candalous Artifice, would
naturally &s;ink in five or &s;ix Days, at mo&s;t: The Fate
of <HI>K. H.</HI> has &s;ufficiently confirm'd that Opinion.</P>
<P>However, tho' there is a good deal in what is
above-mention'd, I take the main Cau&s;e of its Fail|ure
to proceed from what follows.</P>
<P>I find by &s;ome few Per&s;ons, who are highly pleas'd
with that noble Simplicity, and Decency, that runs
quite through the Play, that the Multitude in general
look on it, not as a <HI>new</HI> Play, but as a Play <HI>alter'd</HI>
from <HI>Shake&s;pear:</HI> The many Beauties you have im|prov'd
from him, and &s;ome noted Speeches, you have
made u&s;e of with no very material Alterations (which
was certainly well judg'd), have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the gro&s;s
Imaginations of the Audience, that mo&s;t of the fine
Pa&s;&s;ages of your own, are his too; the two Speeches
of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> at the Council-Table, and
<HI>Harry</HI>'s Reflection, when he fir&s;t hears of the Trea|&s;on,
are univer&s;ally mi&s;taken for <HI>Shake&s;pear:</HI> This I
have found from &s;ome, who&s;e Education, Under|&s;tanding,
and Acquaintance with <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> I ima|gin'd,
might have taught 'em better: And yet their
knowing his Manner of Writing &s;o well, perhaps,
might the &s;ooner lead 'em into the Mi&s;take.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="83">
Add to this, that &s;ome Under&s;trappers of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI>
and the Partizans of t'other Hou&s;e, have improv'd
this Notion of its being a Play of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s not
<HI>very much</HI> alter'd. Now, Sir, allowing what I have
ob&s;erv'd above to be certainly the Game play'd upon
K. <HI>H.</HI> I can no longer wonder, that his Succe&s;s is
little more, than what a good reviv'd Play commonly
meets with.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to profane K. <HI>H.</HI> with
odious Compari&s;ons; but give me Leave to ob&s;erve
to you, that <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">r</HI> once brought the <HI>Double Gallant</HI>
upon the Stage, which was made up of Hints &s;tolen
from a Play of <HI>Burnaby</HI>'s, and another of <HI>Centlivre</HI>'s,
both heartily damn'd the fir&s;t Night, many Years be|fore;
as &s;oon as the good-natur'd Town found him
out, they re&s;ented his calling it a new Play, and
hounded it in the mo&s;t outrageous Manner. Two
Years after we reviv'd it, it met with mo&s;t extra|vagant
Succe&s;s, and it has continu'd in the Stock ever
&s;ince, and never fails of a great Audience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kind Impo&s;tor,</HI> tho' taken (I mean the Hints
only) from a Tran&s;lation of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Play acted
about Thirty Years ago, was damn'd, at its fir&s;t Ap|pearance,
only becau&s;e it was call'd a new Play; but
was reviv'd &s;ome time after, and met with univer&s;al
Approbation, like the former, and is generally acted
twice every Year.</P>
<P><HI>King Lear,</HI> and <HI>Timon of Athens,</HI> met with the
&s;ame Fate, from the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, at their fir&s;t Ap|pearance;
but have both prov'd excellent Stock-Plays
upon their being reviv'd.</P>
<P>Thus, if it can be artfully in&s;inuated to the Town,
that the Managers, or an Author, would pa&s;s an <HI>alter'd</HI>
Play upon 'em for a <HI>new</HI> one, <HI>That</HI> alone would
make 'em outrageous after three or four Days, and
give the Multitude an Opportunity (which they never
let &s;lip) of exerting their proper Qualities. Audiences
<PB N="81" REF="84">
are never guided by Rea&s;on, but always by Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I believe, when you fairly con&s;ider what I have &s;aid
to you, the pre&s;ent Di&s;appointment will give you le&s;s
Surprize. I a&s;&s;ure you, the Play was more applauded
the &s;econd Night, than the fir&s;t; becau&s;e it was infi|nitely
better acted. As to my own Part, the Con|cern
I was under for the Succe&s;s of it, the fir&s;t Night,
threw me into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. I &s;hould be
extremely pleas'd, if you would give your&s;elf the
Trouble of &s;eeing it acted To-morrow Night. Come
but behind the Scenes, and we will place you in &s;ome
Corner, where you &s;hall be invi&s;ible to the Audience.
Dear Sir, let me prevail upon you to come. I like
your Preface; there is a very decent Scorn, and a
mettled Contempt of the Town, in it. You have
hinder'd me from going to Church this Morning, and
I have tir'd your Patience, to be reveng'd of you.
I am, Sir, with the utmo&s;t Regard and Sincerity,</P>

<P>I know you have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on not to be pleas'd
with the Ta&s;te of the Town, which is, as it always
was, and as it ever will be.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ob&s;erv'd
to me many Years ago, that <HI>Don Carlos</HI> &s;ucceeded
much better than either <HI>Venice Pre&s;erv'd</HI> or the <HI>Or|phan,</HI>
and was infinitely more applauded and follow'd
for many Years.&mdash;We know what Reception <HI>Pa|radi&s;e
Lo&s;t</HI> met with in the Author's Life-time.&mdash;In
&s;hort, <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> were full as partial, or rather
heedle&s;s, in ob&s;erving the Merit of living Authors, as
<HI>London.</HI>&mdash;In the former City, <HI>Fannius</HI> had more
Hearers than <HI>Horace.</HI>&mdash;In the latter City, <HI>Euripides,</HI>
&s;o ju&s;tly admir'd by all Po&s;terity, could not &s;tand the
Ridicule of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> but cho&s;e to die in volun|tary
Bani&s;hment, to avoid the Flouts of the People;
and we may conclude, that <HI>Sophocles</HI> him&s;elf e&s;cap'd
the Burle&s;que of that Buffoon Comic (for &s;uch he
was, notwith&s;tanding his Merit in other Re&s;pects),
only becau&s;e he was a Man of Quality and Fortune.&mdash;So that, upon the Whole, I may venture to affirm,
that Po&s;terity only will do Ju&s;tice to Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> who
was ever above the low Artifice of forming Cabals to
&s;upport his Reputation.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of this Truth, that he took <HI>whole Years</HI> to be&s;peak

I may, perhaps, rub thro' my Parts in Comedy; but
