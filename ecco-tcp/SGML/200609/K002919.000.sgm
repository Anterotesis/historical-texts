<HEAD>LETTER FROM DAVID HUME, ESQ. TO THE AUTHOR OF THE DELINEATION OF THE NATURE AND OBLIGATION OF MORALITY.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I write you, I know not to whom I am addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf; I only know he is one who has done me a great deal of honour, and to who&s;e civilities I am obliged. If we be &s;tran|gers, I beg we may be acquainted as &s;oon as you think proper to di&s;cover your&s;elf; if we be acquainted already,
<PB N="2" REF="2">
I beg we may be friends; if friends, I beg we may be more &s;o. Our con|nexion with each other, as men of let|ters, is greater than our difference as adhering to different &s;ects or &s;y&s;tems. Let us revive the happy times, when Atticus and Ca&s;&s;ius the Epicureans, Cicero the Academic, and Brutus the Stoic, could, all of them, live in unre|&s;erved friend&s;hip, together, and were in&s;en&s;ible to all tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, ex|cept &s;o far as they furni&s;hed agreable matter to di&s;cour&s;e and conver&s;ation. Perhaps you are a young man, and being full of tho&s;e &s;ublime ideas, which you have &s;o well expre&s;t, think there can be no virtue upon a more confined &s;y&s;tem. I am not an old one; but be|ing of a cool temperament, have always found, that more &s;imple views were
<PB N="3" REF="3">
&s;ufficient to make me act in a rea&s;on|able manner; <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">; in this faith have I lived, and hope to die.</P>
<P>Your civilities to me &s;o much over|balance your &s;everities, that I &s;hould be ungrateful to take notice of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which, in the heat of com|po&s;ition, have dropt from your pen. I mu&s;t only complain of you a little for a&s;cribing to me the &s;entiments which I had put into the mouth of the Scep|tic in the Dialogue. I have &s;urely en|deavoured to refute the Sceptic with all the force of which I am ma&s;ter; and my refutation mu&s;t be allowed &s;incere, becau&s;e drawn from the capital prin|ciples of my &s;y&s;tem. But you impute to me both the &s;entiments of the Scep|tic and the &s;entiments of his antagoni&s;t,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
which I can never admit of. In every Dialogue, no more than one per&s;on can be &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the au|thor.</P>
<P>Your &s;everity on one head, that of Cha&s;tity, is &s;o great, and I am &s;o little con&s;cious of having given any ju&s;t oc|ca&s;ion to it, that it has afforded me a hint to form a conjecture, perhaps ill grounded, concerning your per&s;on.</P>
<P>I hope to &s;teal a little lei&s;ure from my other occupations, in order to de|fend my philo&s;ophy again&s;t your at|tacks. If I have occa&s;ion to give a new edition of the work, which you have honoured with an an&s;wer, I &s;hall make great advantage of your remarks, and hope to obviate &s;ome of your criti|ci&s;ms.</P>
<P>Your &s;tyle is elegant, and full of
<PB N="5" REF="5">
agreable imagery. In &s;ome few places, it does not fully come up to my ideas of purity and correctne&s;s. I &s;uppo&s;e mine falls &s;till further &s;hort of your ideas. In this re&s;pect, we may certainly be of u&s;e to each other. With regard to our Philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tems, I &s;uppo&s;e we are both &s;o fixt, that there is no hope of any conver&s;ions betwixt us; and for my part, I doubt not but we &s;hall both do as well to remain as we are.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, With great regard, Your mo&s;t obliged humble &s;ervant, DAVID HUME.</SIGNED>
