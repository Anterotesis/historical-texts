<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is more u&s;ual for Poets, than for Writers
of any other de&s;cription, to apologize for pre&s;ent|ing
their Works to the Publick. It is not ea&s;y to de|termine,
whether this ari&s;es from a &s;u&s;picion that their
Talents are unequal to &s;upport the Character they have
a&s;&s;umed, or whether it proceeds from an idea, that
(as of Poetical Merit all the world <HI>are,</HI> or <HI>pretend</HI> to
be, Judges) the utmo&s;t appearance of diffidence is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to defend the Candidates for the Laurel from
the Vengeance of Critici&s;m. The Man who publi&s;hes
a Treati&s;e in Theology, or an E&s;&s;ay on Farriery, comes
<PB N="ii" REF="10">
boldly forward, and delivers his opinion without ap|parent
apprehen&s;ions. But &s;uch is not the ca&s;e with
the Poet; he generally thinks him&s;elf obliged to &s;tate,
<Q REND="inline">"that the following Poems were never intended for
the Public Eye&mdash;that they were written for the
entertainment of a &s;elect Circle, or (how felfi&s;h!)
merely to amu&s;e him&s;elf&mdash;that either the earne&s;t
intreaties of friends, or a dread le&s;t their zeal
might have tempted them to circulate incorrect
copies of his works, are his &s;ole motives for
appealing to the Tribunal of Public Critici&s;m."</Q>&mdash;Such is the general Prelude to Poems. But the
Author of this Volume is much at a lo&s;s how he
may properly deprecate the Public Vengeance, for
having a&s;pired to the title of a Poet; as he confe&s;&s;edly
comes forward, neither urged by the intreaties of
Friends, nor terrified by the threats of Creditors; and
he certainly entertains no apprehen&s;ions that his &s;len|der
&s;tock of Fame may be injured by the publication
of &s;purious Copies, for none &s;uch exi&s;t.&mdash;He has there|fore
<PB N="iii" REF="11">
nothing to plead in his own excu&s;e, but that the
Publick having without di&s;gu&s;t received his humble
attempts in Pro&s;e, he is encouraged by the Protection
he has already experienced, to appear once more as
an Author, hoping, that tho&s;e whom he may fail to
plea&s;e, will pardon his having attempted it.</P>
<P>To many the Peru&s;al of the&s;e Trifles will re&s;tore
the recollection of times long pa&s;t. They will be re|membered
with plea&s;ure, though mingled with that re|gret
which ever attends the recollection of happy days
that are to return no more.</P>
<P>In extenuation of any Errors that may occur in
the&s;e Poems, the Author has only to &s;ay, that they
were mo&s;tly written from the age of Seventeen (when
he commenced his Literary Career) to Twenty-four;
that at that time of life the Imagination is more
active than the Judgement; and that at pre&s;ent
he is &s;o reduced by a long and tedious illne&s;s, as to
<PB N="iv" REF="12">
be incapable of improving whatever he has written.
For the la&s;t four years of his life, tho&s;e hours that
have not been marked with di&s;ea&s;e have been devoted
to &s;tudies of a &s;everer nature, in order to qualify him
for the practice of a profe&s;&s;ion, which a Con&s;titution
debilitated by di&s;ea&s;e obliges him now, for ever, to
relinqui&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had it plea&s;ed the all-wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all events to have &s;pared Mr. B's life, he hoped to have obtained &s;ome appoint|ment in the Diplomatic line, for which, as well as for the Bar, nature and education had excellently qualified him. Mr. B. never had, at any moment of his life, an idea of going into the Mini&s;try&mdash;he &s;aying to his friend about a month before his death, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing <HI>this</HI> world has to offer could ever in|duce me to go into orders whil&s;t it plea&s;es GOD to &s;pare me my under&s;tanding."</Q> Mr. B. had from early youth been <HI>in|treated</HI> to read with deep attention the thirty-third chapter of the Prophet Ezekiel, and St. Paul's Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus; and Mr. B. firmly believed, that <Q REND="inline">"ALL Scripture was given by in&s;piration."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From a mind exhau&s;ted by pain and &s;ickne&s;s, ema|nations
of &s;plendor cannot be expected. Had the
<PB N="v" REF="13">
Author &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that &s;hare of health, which once
con&s;tituted his fir&s;t felicity, he might have rendered
his performances le&s;s de&s;erving of cen&s;ure: but, what|ever
be the re&s;ult of their publication, the writing of
them has occupied many an hour that might have
been wor&s;e employed; and he may add, that his
having a Literary turn of mind has procured him the
acquaintance and friend&s;hip of many, who&s;e &s;uperio|rity
of Talents he readily acknowledges, and from
who&s;e Conver&s;ation he has derived at once Plea&s;ure
and In&s;truction. Neither has an Attachment to Poe|try,
as is too often the ca&s;e, prevented his pur&s;uing
Studies of a different ca&s;t. From the Works of his
Friend Doctor Reid (and tho&s;e of other able Writers
in the &s;ame line), he has derived a plea&s;ure more &s;o|lid
than Poetry can be&s;tow. Poetry may charm with
the power of Fancy; but it is Philo&s;ophy alone that
can &s;trengthen the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="14">
As the Author's pre&s;ent &s;tate of health renders it
probable that this may be his la&s;t Addre&s;s to the
Publick, he will not lay down his pen without ad|verting
to the Reviews. Tho&s;e Channels of Literary
Intelligence are often cen&s;ured, as both partial and
&s;evere. How far the&s;e charges may be ju&s;t, he will
not pretend to determine: but he wishes tho&s;e who
bring the charge to recollect, that Reviewers are
men; that &s;ome degree of partiality is in&s;eparable
from humanity; and that therefore, till we are &s;up|plied
with Reviews from above, they, like every other
human invention, mu&s;t have their imperfections.
However, in matters of Religion, the Reviewers may
have improper bia&s;&s;es; in matters of Belles Lettres,
their opinion will in general be found to be impartial,
and by appeals from their deci&s;ion little is now to be
gained. We live in an age when Literary Merit is
throughly under&s;tood; and the Volumes that are
now condemned, will derive little advantage from the
award of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="15">
Having &s;aid thus much on the &s;ubject of the Re|views,
he thinks it right to declare, that he has not
the lea&s;t per&s;onal acquaintance with any of the Gentle|men
who compile them. Of his connections with
the Reviewers, in his literary capacity, he has no
right to complain. Where he has merited cen&s;ure,
they have inflicted it fairly; and they have often
cheered him with approbation.</P>
<P>Whatever be the re&s;ult of their Deci&s;ion with re|&s;pect
to this Work, he promi&s;es to &s;ubmit without
any appeal. With re&s;pect to the Trifles that com|po&s;e
this Volume, he has only farther to ob&s;erve, that,
in&s;tead of in&s;cribing the whole to one per&s;on, he has
in&s;cribed the &s;eparate Poems to different people, as
&s;light tokens of his e&s;teem. For this mode of Dedi|cation,
though now he does not think him&s;elf bound
to offer any apology, po&s;&s;ibly his plan may recall
to the memory of his Readers the fable of the Hare
and many Friends; and &s;hould the Author fail of
<PB N="viii" REF="16">
&s;ucce&s;s in his pre&s;ent attempt, he, like the Hare, may
experience the inutility of Friend&s;hip. But, what|ever
be the &s;ucce&s;s of his Volume, he will &s;till have
the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that he has never written a
line, which,
<Q>"dying, he might wish to blot."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF MR. MONCK BERKELEY;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESENT
TIME.</BYLINE>
<P>MY fir&s;t knowledge of Mr. Berkeley was at Oxford.
He was then a Gentleman Commoner of Magdalen Hall in
that Univer&s;ity; and though many very re&s;pectable names
were at the &s;ame time on the li&s;t of its members, yet Mr.
Berkeley was &s;o pre-eminently noble in his manners, &s;o
faithful in his friend&s;hips, and &s;o benevolent to his a&s;&s;o|ciates,
that perhaps not one of the &s;ociety envied his high
reputation as a man, or thought them&s;eves le&s;&s;ened by the
acknowledged &s;uperiority of his talents as a &s;cholar. His
delight was in &s;earching out merit; and, well knowing that
it fled from the glare of day, and &s;hould be &s;ought after in
the &s;hade of retirement, he there looked for that humble,
but valuable plant, and, having found it, tran&s;planted it in|&s;tantly
into the riche&s;t &s;oil he had acce&s;s to. The &s;oul of
the great Bi&s;hop Berkeley &s;eemed in every thing to have
<PB N="xiv" REF="21">
animated the body of his Grand&s;on, and, like him, to have
equally de&s;erved the ju&s;t tribute of prai&s;e recorded by the
&s;weet Poet of his day:
<Q>"To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven."</Q></P>
<P>Genius marked him in his earlie&s;t years for a child of her
own adoption; and had not Providence, for &s;ome good pur|po&s;e,
hidden from our eyes, recalled his &s;pirit from the
abodes of men, when it was verging upon the years where
youth ends and manhood begins, he would not have needed
the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every power,
<Q><L>"Whether, by various rules of art,</L>
<L>"To touch the &s;oul, or warm the heart;</L>
<L>"To plea&s;e the eye, delight the mind,</L>
<L>"With objects &s;imple, pure, refin'd:</L>
<L>"To &s;ound &s;ublime the epic &s;train,</L>

<P>GEORGE-MONCK BERKELEY, E&s;quire, LL.B. and
F.S.S.A. was the elde&s;t, and, during the la&s;t eighteen
years of his life, the only child of the Reverend GEORGE
BERKELEY, LL.D. Prebendary of Canterbury (&s;on of
George Lord Bi&s;hop of Cloyne by Anne elde&s;t daughter of
the Right Honourable John For&s;ter, Speaker of the Hou&s;e
of Commons in Ireland) and Eliza elde&s;t daughter of the
Reverend Henry Frin&s;ham, M.A. (by Eliza younge&s;t daugh|ter
and co-heire&s;s of Francis Cherry, E&s;quire, of Shotte&s;brook
Hou&s;e in the county of Berks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed to tell him, that he was as remarkably de|&s;cended by his Mother, as he was nobly by his Father. Two of Mrs. Berke|ley's paternal grand&s;ires were killed in one day at the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;e. Sir John Heidon and Sir George Blundell, Baronets; and the &s;on of the former was highly favoured by Providence to <HI>e&s;cape</HI> an untimely death, by the wretched Lord Bruce's objecting to <HI>his</HI> being &s;econd in that tremendous duel fought be|tween him and Sir Edward Sackville, ance&s;tor to the pre&s;ent worthy Duke of Dor&s;et. Some years ago, when Mr. Berkeley vi&s;ited France, and got a letter of introduction to his Grace, then Amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, containing a very ur|gent reque&s;t that Mr. Berkeley might have particular attention, his Father, laughing, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You may plead your grand&s;ire's <HI>merits</HI> in cro&s;&s;ing the ocean to prevent his Grace's grand&s;ire's being <HI>butchered</HI> by that <HI>wretch</HI> Lord Bruce."</Q> All who have read that tragical tale related by Mr. Addi&s;on in "The Guardian," and in the &s;econd volume of Collin's Peerage, p. 196, mu&s;t rejoice that poor Lord Bruce died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very different &s;pirit from that which influenced him in life; that he, like the thief on the cro&s;s, was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half, or rather <HI>three quarters,</HI> ju&s;t before the <HI>final</HI> clo&s;e of the day of MERCY and GRACE; for his &s;oul pa&s;&s;ed into the region of &s;pirits within the hour.</NOTE>).</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="28">
Mr. Berkeley was born at Bray, in the county of Berks,
on Tue&s;day, February 8, 1763, at half pa&s;t two in the
morning.</P>
<P>It is frequently &s;aid by Biographers, that nothing re|markable
occurred during childhood. Of Mr. Berkeley this
cannot be a&s;&s;erted; for, throughout childhood, youth, man|hood,
and till within a <HI>very</HI> few months of his death, the
hair-breadth e&s;capes of lo&s;ing life were almo&s;t innumera|ble;
an all-gracious Providence con&s;tantly interpo&s;ing, &s;ome|times
very remarkably, to re&s;cue him from death, until he
was enabled, by free Sovereign Grace, through Redeeming
Mercy, to meet that King of Terrors with joy; for he died
triumphing in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>A little before the birth of Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Cadogan's
"E&s;&s;ay on the Nur&s;ing of Children" made its appearance,
when the depo&s;iting children in cradles was exploded; ac|cordingly
a large ea&s;y chair during the day was appropriated
to his u&s;e. When he was about &s;ix weeks old, a per&s;on
going into the nur&s;ery in the du&s;k, before the &s;ervant had
lighted candles, &s;at down on this chair; but providentially
did not &s;it quite to the back, it being very deep. She &s;oon
<PB N="xxi" REF="29">
felt &s;omething move; the infant, finding it&s;elf incommoded,
began to &s;truggle with its arms and legs. Mr. Berkeley,
from his birth, &s;hewed the very uncommon &s;trength of
limbs, which, as he grew up, increa&s;ed; and he was
e&s;teemed the &s;tronge&s;t man in England, by tho&s;e who were
judges. Some of his intimate friends have owed their lives,
in a tumultuous crowd, to the &s;trength of his arm, joined
to his true re&s;olute cool courage, where he did not wi&s;h to
have recour&s;e to his &s;word. Mr. Berkeley's &s;trength was
mu&s;cular, as his bones were remarkably &s;mall; his wri&s;t,
&s;ome time before his death, mea&s;uring little more than &s;ix
inches.</P>
<P>When he was about three months old, his mother was
attacked by &s;o de&s;perate an ague, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed ano|ther
fit mu&s;t have proved fatal to her; yet &s;o unwilling was
&s;he, that her darling, her idol (alas) from his cradle to his
coffin, &s;hould be indebted for his early nouri&s;hment to any
but her&s;elf, that &s;he re&s;olved to attempt the bringing him
up by hand; but he had very nearly lo&s;t his life in the at|tempt,
before a nur&s;e could be procured.</P>
<P>At a very early period of his life he began to &s;hew &s;igns
of that uncommon brilliancy of parts, quickne&s;s of wit, and
&s;oundne&s;s of judgement, which &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed
him through life, even to its late&s;t period. To relate wit|tici&s;ms
of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridicu|lous;
<PB N="xxii" REF="30">
one or two in&s;tances, it is hoped, may, however,
be pardoned. When about three years old, he was &s;earching
the hou&s;e for his mother, whom from his earlie&s;t infan|cy,
he pa&s;&s;ionately loved. Unable to find her, he walked
from room to room, calling her. A lady, who was &s;taying
in the family, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child, what a bleating thou
do&s;t make!"</Q> He in&s;tantly turned round, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To
be &s;ure I do, for I am <HI>bleating for my Dam.</HI>"</Q> When he
was little more than three years and a half old, he was di|verting
him&s;elf in the garden. A beggar came to the gate,
and, &s;eeing the hall doors and windows all open, and no
one in &s;ight, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My pretty little Ma&s;ter, what are you
doing here alone?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am watering &s;ome
flowers for the gardener."</Q> The old fox &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think I
mu&s;t come in and help you;"</Q> on which Mr. Berkeley
flew to the gate, and bolted it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"No, I thank you,
I can do it very well by my&s;elf."</Q> On his maid's a&s;king
him why he bolted the gate, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, if he had
got into the hou&s;e now that the men are out with the
coach, perhaps the maids and I could not have got him out
again."</Q></P>
<P>Genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion are indeed very rarely found
until in&s;tilled into the brea&s;ts of very young children: in
Mr. Berkeley they were certainly indigenous. When a
child in arms, if he was a&s;ked to give a piece of cake out
of his hand, he would in&s;tantly break off three-fourths of it,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="31">
re&s;erving only a very &s;mall piece for him&s;elf, and be un|happy
if the petitioner did not take and eat it. On re|ceiving
his orange after dinner, when it was peeled, he
would retire to the window ahd carefully &s;eparate the quills,
then go out into the &s;ervants' hall, and force one upon
every &s;ervant, eight in number. One evening his mother
ob&s;erving that he kept his left hand clo&s;ed, enquired whe|ther
he had hurt it; the &s;ervant replied, that he had not,
but that he had kept &s;ince dinner, full four hours, a quill
of his orange to give to the coachman, who had been &s;ent
to Wind&s;or on a me&s;&s;age, and that no promi&s;es of care
could prevail on Ma&s;ter Berkeley to entru&s;t her with it,
adding, that he a&s;&s;ured her, <Q REND="inline">"it would <HI>comfort</HI> him after
his ride."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley had been told, as all children &s;hould be,
that the poor had a right to a &s;hare of all his money; ac|cordingly,
the fir&s;t bright &s;ixpence of which he was ma&s;ter,
he procured a hammer, and attempted to break it. On his
&s;ervant's a&s;king him what he was about, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why
Mamma &s;ays, the poor mu&s;t have their &s;hare of it, &s;o I
am going to break it for them."</Q> This attended him to
his late&s;t hour; for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ever &s;hared largely indeed
in every guinea he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's under&s;tanding was &s;uch as often, when a
child, to occa&s;ion his Mother to &s;ay, &s;he hoped he would
<PB N="xxiv" REF="32">
not, in other in&s;tances, re&s;emble the famous Marquis de
Bedmar, of whom, in his Memoires, it is &s;aid, he had the
power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles,
when he was li&s;tening to every thing that was &s;aying by va|rious
per&s;ons, and when he was plotting the de&s;truction of
Venice.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when only five years old, would &s;tand at
the window &s;eat, and hum a tune, and three weeks after|wards
would relate two different conver&s;ations carried on at
the &s;ame time, and not only relate them verbatim, but take
off exactly the action and tone of voice of every &s;peaker.
Of this dangerous, however diverting amu&s;ement, Mr.
Berkeley was early broke by his Mother.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t eight years and a half of his life Mr. Berkeley
had no other in&s;tructor than his Mother; and &s;uch was the
extreme volatility of his genius, the wonderful <HI>&s;trength</HI>
of his under&s;tanding, and the <HI>natural</HI> wilfulne&s;s of his
temper, that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an
Herculean labour, &s;o much as often to occa&s;ion him to &s;ay,
when grown up, that <Q REND="inline">"he was <HI>re&s;olved</HI> not to learn to
read; that he did verily believe his Mother was the only
<HI>human</HI> being who could have accompli&s;hed it until he
was old enough to feel the nece&s;&s;ity of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Gray's Court, per&s;i&s;ted in a like re&s;olution, &s;aying it was non&s;en&s;e to learn, until he, at thirteen, was &s;ent to &s;ea on board a &s;hip commanded by Sir John Norris, who, on learning the young gentleman's &s;entiments, a&s;&s;ured him, that he &s;hould be flogged every day until he could read. The Chaplain was appointed his Tutor. He was, after this declaration, a very apt &s;cholar. This acute, worthy, young gentle|man died at the age of twenty-two. It is &s;ometimes a misfortune to children to be too clever.</NOTE>;"</Q>&mdash;adding,
<PB N="xxv" REF="33">
<Q REND="inline">"I think my dear Mother &s;eemed to have been &s;ent into
this world on purpo&s;e to <HI>teach</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> me, as I at|tended
to, nor cared for any one but her&s;elf; finding that
<HI>&s;he</HI> alone had that <HI>invincible</HI> per&s;everance requi&s;ite to go|vern
me."</Q></P>
<P>Before he attained his &s;ixth year, he read incomparably;
and his comments on what he read, and what he &s;aw, of|ten
occa&s;ioned the late George Lord Lyttelton, when &s;taying
at his father's on a vi&s;it, to declare <Q REND="inline">"he had the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t,</HI> as
well as the <HI>mo&s;t brilliant</HI> powers of mind he had ever
&s;een;"</Q> often exclaiming, as did the late learned Dr. Sum|ner
of Harrow School, and many other great men, <Q REND="inline">"What
a <HI>man</HI> this <HI>very extraordinary child</HI> mu&s;t become!"</Q> and
Mr. Berkeley more than an&s;wered the expectations of his
childhood, as all the learned and great men who had &s;hare
in his education bore te&s;timony. His beloved and re|&s;pected
tutor at Eton, the Reverend Dr. Norbury, too
well known in the learned world to need any eulogium
from a feeble pen, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that there were wonderful
traits of originality in all Mr. Berkeley's exerci&s;es. On this
being mentioned one day by a friend to his Father, Mr.
<PB N="xxvi" REF="34">
Berkeley, then a young man, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my <HI>dear Tutor</HI>
(as, to the time of his death, he ever termed Dr. Nor|bury)
I do pity him. He u&s;ed to &s;torm, and &s;ay, 'I
have thirty <HI>dolts,</HI> that <HI>cannot</HI> do any thing; and I have three
or four, with that idle varlet Berkeley at their head, that
<HI>can do every thing,</HI> and that <HI>will</HI> do nothing."</Q> And when
Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to complain of his &s;on's idlene&s;s to Dr.
Norbury, his reply was, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if your &s;on would apply at
<HI>all,</HI> he mu&s;t carry the world before him; but I mu&s;t tell
you fairly, &s;uch is his genius, that I do not believe that
<HI>man lives,</HI> who can make him apply regularly, until he
comes <HI>him&s;elf</HI> to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of it."</Q></P>
<P>The very learned Dr. Hill, profe&s;&s;or of Greek at the uni|ver&s;ity
of St. Andrew's, (now Dean of the Chapel Royal at
Edinburgh,) where Mr. Berkeley <HI>did</HI> apply, u&s;ed to &s;ay, that
he would engage to &s;elect Mr. Berkeley's exerci&s;e from
among&s;t a thou&s;and, without any other mark than what
the French term <Q REND="inline">"<HI>le marque</HI> d'ouvrier."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, although he could not be called a
<HI>man</HI> of bu&s;ine&s;s, might with propriety be termed a <HI>crea|ture</HI>
of bu&s;ine&s;s, from &s;even years old; for he always felt
him&s;elf, as he thought, equal to tran&s;act any thing that he
offered his &s;ervices to perform. The following little inci|dent
may &s;erve to illu&s;trate this: before he was &s;even years
old, his Mother, being alarmed le&s;t one of his front teeth
&s;hould grow uneven from the old one not being removed,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="35">
had &s;ent him to town to Hemmet, who very hone&s;tly &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"All would be right if let alone;"</Q> and he proved that his
judgement was as great as his hone&s;ty; for, when Mr.
Berkeley grew up, and &s;ometimes went to him for his tooth
powder, he often &s;aid, that Mr. Berkeley had the fine&s;t and
&s;tronge&s;t &s;et of teeth he ever &s;aw in any head. He returned
home with a gentleman who was coming on a vi&s;it to his
Father's. A lady of very large fortune happened to be in
the machine, going on a vi&s;it to a friend at Taplow. Finding
that he lived in the neighbourhood, &s;he a&s;ked him how far
it was from Maidenhead Bridge to Taplow? He replied, that
it was about ten minutes drive. She &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t walk,
as her friends, not knowing the day of her arrival, could
not &s;end their carriage. He replied, that &s;he certainly
&s;hould not do that; for that his Father's coach would be
&s;ent to convey the gentleman and him&s;elf; and that he
would certainly have the plea&s;ure of taking her up the hill
to her friend's hou&s;e. The in&s;tant he got out of the ma|chine
he enquired of Mr. March if his Father's coach was
come, and had the mortification to hear, that the coach|man
had called to &s;ay, that the carriage was gone on to
carry &s;ome gentlemen over Maidenhead Thicket, and would
call for him in an hour. Mr. Berkeley, not then &s;even
years old, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, it is very <HI>improper that a lady</HI>
&s;hould walk on the high road <HI>alone;</HI> &s;o <HI>I</HI> will have the
honour of walking up with you. I can borrow a <HI>&s;tick</HI> of
Mr. March."</Q> This <HI>protection</HI> was, as will naturally be
<PB N="xxviii" REF="36">
&s;uppo&s;ed, politely declined; and the lady ordered a chai&s;e.
As &s;oon as &s;he alighted, her fir&s;t que&s;tion was, <Q REND="inline">"Do you
know Dr. Berkeley of Cookham?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, intimately."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know his little boy? If you do not, you do not
know, I very believe, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible little crea|ture
in the world, and the polite&s;t;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"there was a
tall young man (of, I &s;uppo&s;e, near thirty) with him; but
the dear child has twenty times his &s;en&s;e, and forty times
his politene&s;s."</Q> The gentleman was a learned man, who
laughed at that plea&s;ing accompli&s;hment, politene&s;s: he
was <HI>then</HI> what <HI>fine</HI> men are <HI>now.</HI> Mr. Berkeley was almo&s;t
idolized by the family to whom the lady was going; &s;o it
appeared not &s;o wonderful to them.</P>
<P>In the May after he had completed his eighth year, Dr.
Berkeley went to re&s;ide at his prebendal hou&s;e in the Oaks
at Canterbury, where he was immediately &s;ent to the
King's &s;chool, under the care of tho&s;e two eminent ma&s;ters,
the learned, accompli&s;hed, elegant Dr. Beauvoir, and
the reverend, learned, and worthy Mr. Tucker. In Au|gu&s;t,
a gentleman's family going to France to place a
&s;on at St. Quintin, to learn the language; his Mother &s;ug|ge&s;ted
to his Father the advantage of &s;ending Mr. Berkeley,
who, although &s;he had taught him to read French well, yet
found it impo&s;&s;ible, with an hou&s;e full of Engli&s;h &s;ervants,
to make him &s;peak it; and as it never was the con&s;idera|tion
of a moment with his parents, whether any thing con|cerning
<PB N="xxix" REF="37">
their children's education was to co&s;t one guinea or
one hundred, immediately determined to &s;end him. Young
as he was, he was the only one of the party who knew any
thing of French; and the &s;en&s;ible amiable lady, who&s;e &s;on
was going to learn the French language, at her return, de|clared,
that they &s;hould have been half &s;tarved at the inns
and hotels, had not Mr. Berkeley been with them, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"That lovely little creature &s;eemed quite in&s;pired; for he
began in French telling the waiters it was a &s;hame to let
Engli&s;h ladies and gentlemen &s;it there without their tea
and chocolate."</Q> He u&s;ed to run to the bar, and drive
them in before him with whatever was wanted. In his
own language, it may with &s;tricte&s;t truth be a&s;&s;erted,
that even at that early period of life he was a great profi|cient;
for there is not a word in the Engli&s;h language which,
at the age of &s;even years, he could not &s;pell without book;
and of mo&s;t of the difficult words, he perfectly under&s;tood
their &s;en&s;e, and u&s;ed them with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety;
which occa&s;ioned the &s;en&s;ible Sir J. Temple, brother of
the abovenamed amiable lady, who accompanied her to
France, repeatedly to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I never &s;aw &s;o &s;en&s;ible a crea|ture.
Here is my nephew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very amiable D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, E&s;quire, of Hamp&s;hire.</NOTE>, ju&s;t double his age, who

This ea&s;y ta&s;k, to both mi&s;tre&s;s and &s;cholar, produced a laughable circum&s;tance. One day, when Mr. Berkeley was about three years and a half old, after dinner he being at play in the window, a gentleman who had dined at Dr. Berkeley's &s;peaking of the unfortunate Captain B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! poor man; it is pity his father and mother did not take it into their heads to marry before he was born: it makes the difference of 4000 l. a year to him."</Q> Mr. Berkeley turned round, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Poor man! I pity him exceedingly. It is a <HI>very</HI> great misfortune to be illegitimate."</Q> The gentleman, turning to him, &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"You little animal, how could you become acquainted with a word almo&s;t as long as your&s;elf?"</Q> No one &s;uppo&s;ed him attending to the conver&s;ation; but, from the time he was capable of &s;peaking, although deeply engaged at play, he would frequently, a week after, relate <HI>verbatim</HI> even long conver&s;ations, with every ge&s;ture, and the tone of voice of every &s;peaker. In mimickry he was an adept, but was early taught by his Mother the danger of indulging it, and very rarely indeed practi&s;ed it, never but when earne&s;tly reque&s;ted by &s;ome very intimate friend, and in very &s;elect company.</NOTE> of

<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall watch him through life, and bid adieu to all
<HI>my</HI> &s;agacity, if he does not become one of the greate&s;t
men of the age."</Q> Mr. Berkeley remained &s;omewhat le&s;s
than a year in France, boarding in the hou&s;e of a truly re|&s;pectable
Roman catholic <HI>negociant</HI> of the name of Mont|jole,
under the kind in&s;pection of the truly amiable Pro|te&s;tant
family of Fitzou. The unfeigned affection he ever
retained for the French friends of his early youth appeared
when, at the age of &s;eventeen, he publi&s;hed his <Q REND="inline">"Maria,
or the Generous Ru&s;tic,"</Q> by his &s;electing the names of
his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families
with whom he lived, and tho&s;e by whom he was care&s;&s;ed
<PB N="xxxi" REF="39">
and delighted, indeed almo&s;t idolized, for he had ever mo&s;t
engaging attracting manners. His heroine took her name
from the &s;ervant of Mon&s;ieur and Madame Montjole, who
loved him &s;o tenderly, that when he was to quit St. Quin|tin,
at the age of between nine and ten, &s;he was obliged
to be &s;ent by her mi&s;tre&s;s for two or three days to vi&s;it her
parents, while <HI>le petit g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Angloi&s;e,</HI> as he was univer|&s;ally
called at that place, from his collecting a number of
boys a little older than him&s;elf, and exerci&s;ing them every
evening, and marching them with a drum and other mar|tial
mu&s;ic about the town, after which he u&s;ed frequently
to entertain them with fruit, cakes, &amp;c. His <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> in
France fully an&s;wered, as perhaps very few Engli&s;hmen
were ever more throughly ma&s;ters of the French language,
&s;peaking and writing it as correctly as he did his mother
tongue. On being thanked by a gentleman, who had re|que&s;ted
him to take up his pen, for his elegant tran&s;lation
of "Nina," in&s;cribed to the Honourable Mr. Hobart, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the favour was very trifling, for (excepting
the &s;onnet) it employed me only ju&s;t &s;ix hours."</Q></P>
<P>When a child at the King's School at Canterbury, his
mother u&s;ed to ri&s;e at &s;ix o'clock in &s;ummer, to walk with
him out of the city for country air. One morning, about
&s;even o'clock, pa&s;&s;ing by the city wall, a woman with a
child &s;at begging. As Mrs. Berkeley never gave to tram|pers,
&s;he told the woman, &s;he could not relieve her. Mr.
<PB N="xxxii" REF="40">
Berkeley, then little more than eight years old, unob&s;erved,
&s;tayed behind talking to her. When he joined his Mother,
&s;he began reproving him, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"It is very wrong to
talk to &s;uch per&s;ons without one means to relieve them,
and that &s;he was per&s;uaded his ye&s;terday's allowance was
all gone:"</Q> to which he replied, in his &s;weetly melodious
voice, <Q REND="inline">"Why, the poor woman &s;aid &s;he had not ate a <HI>mor&s;el
to-day</HI> (the church clock &s;truck <HI>&s;even</HI> as he was &s;peaking);
and I told her, I had no money; but a&s;ked her, if &s;ome
gingerbread nuts that I bought la&s;t night would be any
comfort to her and her <HI>poor little child;</HI> and &s;he &s;aid yes;
&s;o I &s;tayed that I might get them <HI>all</HI> out of my pocket
for her."</Q></P>
<P>His mother's eyes filled with tears of gratitude to God for
having ble&s;&s;ed her child with <HI>&s;uch</HI> an heart; and &s;he has fre|quently
declared that had &s;he been offered fifty thou&s;and
pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that (through
life) lovely heart, &s;he would have rejected it. The &s;ame &s;weet
&s;pirit attended him amid&s;t all his torturing illne&s;s. Not many
days before his death, a poor family in di&s;tre&s;s being named,
he turned on the &s;ofa on which he was lying, and, not finding
in his pocket what he thought &s;ufficient to &s;end them, eagerly
de&s;ired his &s;ervant might be called, to take his keys to get
him &s;ome more money, to &s;end to them; and, when his
mother a&s;&s;ured him that they had been already relieved by
his father and aunt, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"that a <HI>little</HI> more would
comfort them!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxxiii" REF="41">
When Mr. Berkeley was between ten and eleven years
old, a melancholy affair happened at Canterbury. One of
tho&s;e unfortunate orphans who are &s;aid to be <HI>happy</HI> in
having CAREFUL guardians, had, in the &s;ummer vacation,
&s;tepped over from London to Paris, had there &s;pent more
than his &s;canty allowance, had repeatedly applied to his
<HI>careful</HI> guardians (one, I think, his maternal uncle) for a
little of his <HI>own</HI> money. His humble &s;uit was rejected.
He, however, reached Dover without a guinea; he again
applied, but in vain. Utterly unable to reach London, this
unfortunate youth, not yet nineteen, &s;allied forth on
the high road between Dover and Canterbury. He unfor|tunately
met with an <HI>amiable</HI> farmer and his <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate
cara-&s;po&s;a</HI> in what is called an hurdy-gurdy. From the
former he took a &s;ilver-pewter watch with a grea&s;y leather
chain, and a fox's head &s;et in bra&s;s; from the other, about
&s;eventeen &s;hillings. This worthy pair drove with all &s;peed
to rai&s;e an hue and cry after their <HI>foot</HI> highwayman.
The poor youth returned to the alehou&s;e whence he &s;allied
out, borrowed a petticoat of the maid &s;ervant, got a cork,
blacked his face, and e&s;caped into a wood, where he was
taken, and in this wretched di&s;gui&s;e brought to Canterbury.
The news of &s;o extraordinary a figure was &s;oon &s;pread; the
children belonging to the King's School went beyond their
bounds to &s;ee him. Mr. Berkeley &s;oon returned, and told
his Mother the lamentable tale. She, of cour&s;e, moralized
on the &s;ubject. Soon a violent noi&s;e was heard; Mr.
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="42">
Berkeley &s;tarted to the window; then, &s;itting down, ex|claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Good God! how can our boys be &s;uch brutes!"</Q>
and looked as pale as death. His Mother, who is &s;hort|&s;ighted,
a&s;ked him what it was? He replied, <Q REND="inline">"The ju&s;tices
are &s;itting, and this poor creature is going to be exa|mined,
and our boys are hallooing after him, as if
he were a mad dog."</Q> It being one of tho&s;e days on
which the &s;chool hours permit the gentlemen's &s;ons who
board at home to dine with their families, Mrs. Berke|ley
ob&s;erved, that her &s;on did not eat at all, but leaned
back in his chair. She enquired if he was ill; he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What ails you then, that you do not eat? Eat
your dinner, I de&s;ire you."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I cannot eat
a mor&s;el,</HI> for thinking of this poor creature, ju&s;t gone to
St. Dun&s;tan's gaol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At his examination &s;everal que&s;tions were a&s;ked him, the an&s;wering of which tended to his crimination. Dr. Berkeley, who, although in the com|mi&s;&s;ion for Kent, Berks, and Middle&s;ex, never acted, called out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Young man, do not an&s;wer any que&s;tion that is a&s;ked you. Thank God the laws of England do not oblige any man to accu&s;e him&s;elf."</Q> The youth took his advice. The farmer and his odious dame &s;wore &s;o <HI>readily</HI> and &s;o <HI>po&s;i|tively</HI> through every thing, that he was committed, and took his trial at Maid|&s;tone, and was tran&s;ported for three years. He lived, however, to return, and enjoy a good fortune, and, no doubt, thank his careful guardians.</NOTE>."</Q> He accordingly went without his
dinner. The next day, when he came in from &s;chool at
twelve o'clock, he repaired, as u&s;ual, to his Mother's
dre&s;&s;ing-room. He gently approached his Mother, and
began as follows: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mamma, I am &s;ure I &s;hould
<PB N="xxxv" REF="43">
be very &s;orry to a&s;k <HI>you</HI> to do <HI>any thing improper</HI> for a lady
to do; but could there be any impropriety in your or|dering
John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very worthy Mr. Wright&s;on, now ma&s;ter of the workhou&s;e at Can|terbury, who lived with Dr. Berkeley near thirty years, and married from his &s;ervice, was in the hou&s;e when Mr. Berkeley was born. He ever took the mo&s;t tender, judicious, and re&s;pectful care of him in infancy and youth. A very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated, of Mr. Wright&s;on's bargain|ing with a bargeman, to buy Mr. Berkeley, then &s;ix years old, which entirely cured Mr. Berkeley of a <HI>mo&s;t dangerous</HI> trick, of which had Mr. Wright&s;on told his Mother, the little man would have received a heavy cha&s;ti&s;ement indeed.</NOTE> to carry that <HI>poor</HI> young man a few bottles
of wine to the gaol? for my heart bleeds for him, and <HI>I</HI>
have not money enough to buy him wine."</Q> His Mother
told him &s;he would mention it at dinner to his Father, who,
&s;he was very certain, would give orders concerning it.
Perhaps the poor young man owed the pre&s;ervation of his
life to Dr. Berkeley's philanthropy.</P>
<P>At the age of twelve, he lo&s;t his only brother, near four
years younger than him&s;elf, of whom he was mo&s;t pa&s;&s;io|nately
fond, and who&s;e death he ever lamented till he
was going to rejoin him in the realms of bli&s;s. As children
this was remarkable. The exqui&s;ite beauty of his brother
attracted the eyes of all beholders, drew per&s;ons to their
doors and windows to look at him, which, &s;o entirely void
of envy was Mr. Berkeley through life, that he u&s;ed to
come home in extacies, telling his mother how every body
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="44">
admired his <HI>brother's</HI> beauty. When he was about &s;ix years
old, a lady meeting him one day, who admired him much,
a&s;ked him if his little brother was like him. He in&s;tantly re|plied,
<Q REND="inline">"O dear, Madam, not at all; he is a va&s;t deal hand|&s;omer
than I am: every body wonders at his beauty that
meets him in the &s;treet."</Q> When one was about eight,
the other rather more than four years old, the celebrated
George Lord Lyttelton, &s;taying &s;ome time on a vi&s;it at Dr.
Berkeley's, &s;aid to a gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"that he did really think,
that, mind and per&s;on, they were the very fine&s;t children
he had ever &s;een during the cour&s;e of his life."</Q></P>
<P>The death of Mr. Berkeley's younger brother, cau&s;ed
by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in Canterbury,
occa&s;ioned his being removed to Eton &s;chool &s;ome months
&s;ooner than was intended by his Father; but his Mother,
trembling for her darling, the moment the phy&s;ician pro|nounced
his brother's fever infectious, begged he might
be &s;ent away immediately, which he was within the hour,
under the care of a faithful tender &s;ervant, who lived at his
Father's family at the time of his birth, and until within
about four years of Mr. Berkeley's death, when he married.
For this worthy man Mr. Berkeley ever retained the mo&s;t
grateful regard and affection, as did his Parents, for his con|&s;tant
unwearied attention paid by him to the health, the
manners, the morals, of their ever-to-be-lamented &s;on. To
this worthy per&s;on's care was he con&s;tantly confided, from
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="45">
the time that he began to run alone, until after he quitted
Eton &s;chool, and had a &s;ervant of his own. Mr. Berkeley
u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"It is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s the grati|tude
I feel towards John, for his wonderfully judicious
method of managing &s;uch a refractory chap as I was,
e&s;pecially when I was from home, and he had not my
Mother to call in to his aid."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, with perhaps as amiable, as lovely a nature
as ever God be&s;towed on any fallen child of Adam, had a
very high &s;pirit, and a very uncommonly wilful temper.
Mr. Wright&s;on, by civility, gentlene&s;s, and ridicule, as a
child and youth could prevail on Mr. Berkeley to give up
any project to do any thing. Mr. Berkeley had a very
affectionate regard for him; and, when vi&s;iting at his Fa|ther's
from Oxford or the Temple, if it were but from
Saturday to Monday, he u&s;ed con&s;tantly to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t
go and &s;it half an hour with my old friend John in his
pantry, and talk over old times, or he will think me
unkind;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure I owe it to him, for the
<HI>judicious</HI> care he took of me in childhood and youth."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's behaviour to &s;ervants, as &s;ervants, was, from
early youth, very remarkably kind; and he never had any
&s;ervant who would not have ri&s;qued almo&s;t every thing to
&s;erve and oblige him, excepting one Italian, whom he took
for a few weeks, after an old &s;ervant of his married. This
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="46">
execrable villain threatened to murder him, for having or|dered
him to go a journey on the top of a &s;tage-coach,
Mr. Berkeley having a friend in the po&s;t-chai&s;e with him.
Such are foreign &s;ervants more frequently than is imagined
by the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> per&s;ons who confide in them in preference to
their own countrymen, who are &s;eldom tempted to rob
or murder a ma&s;ter, having no foreign tongue to &s;ecure
them a <HI>&s;afe</HI> retreat on the Continent.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's tutor at Eton was, as mentioned above,
the learned and re&s;pectable Dr. Norbury, under who&s;e tui|tion
he had been placed by his Father, at the <HI>earne&s;t</HI> re|que&s;t
of his Mother, who knew his merits as a tutor,
having re&s;ided at Wind&s;or four years before her marriage,
and conceived him particularly calculated to direct <HI>&s;uch</HI> a
&s;pirit as her darling &s;on. The event proved that &s;he was
not mi&s;taken; for, volatile and idle as Mr. Berkeley was,
it is certain Dr. Norbury contrived to make him apply more
than ever any one before had done, excepting his Mother,
who often regretted, that, finding what ca&s;t of genius her
elde&s;t &s;on had, &s;he had not &s;et about learning Latin and
Greek, that &s;he might have <HI>made</HI> him apply more clo&s;ely
in his youth. As a proof of Mrs. Berkeley's inflexible
&s;teadine&s;s, in teaching her &s;on and correcting his perver&s;e|ne&s;s
of temper, &s;he once made him &s;ay the word "Nico|demus"
<HI>thirty</HI> times, when he was about five years old,
which he either could not, or would not, pronounce pro|perly.
<PB N="xxxix" REF="47">
When grown up, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear
Mother, it was <HI>would not;</HI> for it was one of my numerous
trials of &s;kill with you;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"but you were <HI>very
wi&s;e</HI> to do it, or God knows what mu&s;t have become
of me!"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley's grand object was to &s;ee his &s;on as great a
&s;cholar as his father Bi&s;hop Berkeley. Never having been
at any &s;chool him&s;elf, but coming immediately from the
palace of Cloyne to Chri&s;t Church in Oxford, he had
conceived that Eton collegers, if they had talents, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be excellent &s;cholars; and, after his &s;on had been
a con&s;iderable time at Eton, boarding at the hou&s;e of the
worthy Mrs. Tyrrell, and her truly amiable niece Mrs.
Brookland, whom Mr. Berkeley, through his life, termed
<Q REND="inline">"that angelic-tempered woman,"</Q> he dutifully &s;ubmitted
to go into the long chamber, to the extreme affliction of
his Mother, who conjured his Father, with many tears,
not to remove him; but he con&s;ulted, and followed the
advice of, the then provo&s;t of Eton, Dr. Barnard, although
he had, by his accompli&s;hed, worthy friend, the late Dr.
Sumner, of Harrow, been cautioned again&s;t his wiles, in
the&s;e remarkable words: <Q REND="inline">"Never tru&s;t that man: he has a
<HI>black</HI> heart: I had my&s;elf been head ma&s;ter of Eton, my
friends in power having &s;ecured it for me; but, on my
a&s;king if Dr. Barnard was to be provo&s;t, and being an|&s;wered
in the affirmative, I, for that <HI>&s;ole</HI> rea&s;on, begged
<PB N="xl" REF="48">
to decline it."</Q> The &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Dr. Barnard
fully ju&s;tified the truth of the character Dr. Sumner had
given of him. Could any man but Dr. Barnard have treated
the fir&s;t &s;chool in England, over which he had &s;o long pre|&s;ided,
and which he had, upon the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the <HI>whole</HI> &s;o well; for certainly, in &s;ome in&s;tances, he was tyranni|cal, even cruel, which the following well-known fact mu&s;t prove to all impar|tial per&s;ons. The late General Brudenell, deputy governor of Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, being with his regiment in Germany, one day, as his lady was &s;itting at dinner, her &s;on from Eton came in. She naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole &s;chool day. The youth (aged between thirteen and fourteen) replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I am expelled."</Q> Mrs. Brudenell (the knife and fork dropping from her hand) exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God! child, what have you done? Have you killed a boy?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, I have done nothing but called my dame's upper maid a thief."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That is impo&s;&s;ible, child: you mu&s;t have done &s;omething wor&s;e than that, or I am &s;ure Dr. Barnard would not have expelled you."</Q> The boy related the whole tran&s;action, which appeared to her &s;o utterly incredible, that &s;he in&s;tantly &s;ent a &s;ervant to reque&s;t a gentleman of large fortune, her near neighbour, to call on her immediately; when the youth related to him the following facts, as they proved to be: <Q REND="inline">"That, having lo&s;t his Dictionary, he borrowed one, for two or three days, of &s;ome boys; but, finding that inconvenient, he and two of his friends went to the &s;econd-hand book&s;eller's in Eton, to try to buy one. A Dictionary was immediately produced, when one of his friends &s;aid, 'It is exactly like your own.' The other &s;aid, 'I verily believe it is your own.' Young Brudenell a&s;ked of whom he bought it. The man without he&s;itation &s;aid, 'Of dame <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s upper maid. She told me, a boy, who had left &s;chool, had given it to her.' On a clo&s;e in&s;pection, there appeared a paper pa&s;ted over the in&s;ide of the cover. This being removed, Ma&s;ter Brudenell's name, and the date of the year when it was bought at Mr. Pote's, appeared. They carried it off; and, as &s;oon as they arrived there, &s;hewed it to the re&s;t of the boys of the hou&s;e, who unanimou&s;ly agreed to interrogate the woman, how it came into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>Mr. Berkeley, being ever a mo&s;t obedient &s;on, went into

what he had a right to expect from &s;ome of tho&s;e in

&s;end for him frequently, and pay every attention to the

It was evident, that Mr. Berkeley <HI>never</HI> e&s;caped pu|ni&s;hment,
when it could at any rate be contrived to inflict
it; and as a colleger, he became more liable to it. His
Father, learning this from other young men, as well as
from his &s;on, offered to take him from college; but, with
that fortitude, which attended him through life, through
his torturing illne&s;s for the la&s;t three years of it to his late&s;t

years."</Q> However, when he was a little turned of &s;ix|teen,
his Father, in&s;tead of letting him remain until nine|teen,
which was his original intention, took him home to
his hou&s;e at Cookham, determining to become his tutor
for two years, until he went to Oxford, whither he in|tended
to remove his family during Mr. Berkeley's <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI>
at that univer&s;ity; and the refu&s;al of a hou&s;e in St. Giles's
was &s;ecured to Dr. Berkeley, which was occupied by the

<P>On Mr. Berkeley's quitting &s;chool, in order to atone for
the want of cricket at dear Eton, Mr. Berkeley had a
fine hunter kept for him by his Father, and he generally
hunted twice a week with the buck hounds. Mr. Berke|ley
rode remarkably well.</P>
<P>The village and neighbourhood of Cookham, it &s;hould be

lukily for Mr. Berkeley, ju&s;t at that time, to abound with
&s;en&s;ible, cultivated, poli&s;hed families; had his Parents &s;e|lected
them, they could not have done it more in general
to their wi&s;h. The&s;e families, viz. the polite Lord Co|nyngham's;

Thomas Parry's, E&s;quire; and tho&s;e of two

Mr. Hamilton, with his agreeable family, the &s;en&s;ible,
and worthy relict of General Leighton, with her accom|pli&s;hed

<P>But to return. When the time of Mr. Berkeley's de|parture
drew near, he, very humbly and &s;en&s;ibly, reque&s;ted
his Father to permit him to pa&s;s three years at the uni|ver&s;ity
of St. Andrew in Scotland; by which time, to u&s;e
his own words, <Q REND="inline">"All my <HI>dear</HI> idle Eton friends will have
quitted Oxford, and <HI>I</HI> &s;hall not be tempted to go out
twice a week with Lord Abingdon's hounds."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley took his la&s;t farewell of his amiable
friends at the Ferry-hou&s;e, he could not articulate, went
out, mounted his hor&s;e, and followed the carriage over
the Ferry. It was a long, and not a very plea&s;ant journey,
<PB N="xlvi" REF="54">
to quit a beautiful native country, to adopt the language
of the poet, &s;peaking of the &s;oul entering the world of
&s;pirits,
<Q><L>&mdash; to go,</L>
<L>To be &s;he knows not what, &s;he knows not where.</L></Q></P>
<P>His parents accompanied him to the land of kind ho&s;pita|lity,
as it mu&s;t ever be termed by the Writer of this Preface,
where Mr. Berkeley pa&s;&s;ed three years and an half mo&s;t
happily; where he formed a friend&s;hip with &s;ome of the
fir&s;t characters in that kingdom, with many per&s;ons of rank,
and al&s;o among&s;t the literati, which ended <HI>but with his life.</HI>
Mr. Berkeley had the honour, the <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> to be <HI>enfant
de famille</HI> at Melvil Hou&s;e; and he, with heart-felt gratitude,
termed the exqui&s;itely pious Earl and Counte&s;s of Leven
his <HI>Scotti&s;h parents.</HI> The goodne&s;s of that illu&s;trious pair
not only invited him to vi&s;it there for weeks him&s;elf, but
al&s;o to carry any Engli&s;h or Scotch &s;tudent he plea&s;ed with
him. Mr. Berkeley was too judicious, and too well-bred,
to make an improper u&s;e of this conde&s;cending goodne&s;s,
having never introduced any but two or three Engli&s;hmen,
&s;ons of men of rank or fa&s;hion, con&s;tantly &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Lord
Leven <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know the characters of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of young
Scotti&s;h gentlemen too well for <HI>me</HI> to introduce them."</Q>
With what delight would he often talk of the happy hours
&s;pent at Melvil Hou&s;e, and his gratitude to his honoured
<PB N="xlvii" REF="55">
friend for inviting him attend him to Edinburgh, when his
lord&s;hip was appointed by his Maje&s;ty lord high commi&s;|&s;ioner
of Scotland, as al&s;o one of his introduced-friends,
the &s;on of an Engli&s;h Peer, and his lord&s;hip's giving
<HI>expre&s;s</HI> orders, that Mr. Berkeley &s;hould never dine any
one day at the pur&s;e bearer's table, but always at the com|mi&s;&s;ioner's!
It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;mi&s;s this article without
attempting to celebrate the wonderful conde&s;cending amia|bility
of the <HI>noble&s;&s;e</HI> of Scotland particularly, and in com|mon
with the ancient gentry of that kingdom, to &s;trangers
of any degree of fa&s;hion, and decent character. It was a
common remark of Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Were a Scotch gentle|man
to &s;ettle for &s;ome time in any <HI>&s;outhern</HI> or <HI>ea&s;tern</HI>
county of England, I wonder how many peers, or men
who in <HI>fortune</HI> equal peers, would vi&s;it him?"</Q> And al|mo&s;t
every peer and man of fortune in Fife have done us
that honour; which mu&s;t ever be remembered with the
mo&s;t heart-felt gratitude by the Writer of this Preface.
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! &s;hame to our <HI>Engli&s;h pride!</HI>"</Q> u&s;ed to exclaim Dr.
Berkeley. Although born in London, he &s;pent the fir&s;t
eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illu&s;|trious-minded
Father in the <HI>next</HI> ho&s;pitable country in Eu|rope
to Scotland: for the Scotch do certainly exceed even
the Iri&s;h. As Mrs. Wedderburn u&s;ed to &s;ay to the Wri|ter
of the&s;e pages, <Q REND="inline">"The Iri&s;h give you an excellent dinner
and &s;upper, and let you go out to <HI>&s;eek</HI> a bed; <HI>we</HI> always
find one."</Q> The remark was ju&s;t, and worthy the great
<PB N="xlviii" REF="56">
good &s;en&s;e of that throughly ho&s;pitable polite lady, who,
having heard that Dr. Berkeley's family, none of whom
&s;he had ever then &s;een, were travelling near her hou&s;e, im|mediately
ordered her beds to be prepared, and mo&s;t po|litely
vi&s;ited them at their inn, telling them that every
thing was ready for their reception. This, and numberle&s;s
other almo&s;t &s;imilar attentions from numerous other fa|milies
of rank and fa&s;hion has, for the la&s;t fifteen years,
cau&s;ed the writer of this to term Scotland the Land of
polite <HI>kind</HI> Ho&s;pitality. Such may it long continue; and
they meet a more grateful return than they often do, when
they vi&s;it England; than did the amiable <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of
Scotland, from the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who went in and
<HI>hid</HI> him&s;elf when he &s;aw the equipage of his noble ho&s;t in
his park&mdash;one is tempted to wonder that he ever could
emerge from his hiding place. One of the amiable &s;ons of
Lord Leven, coming from abroad, went to an inn at Can|terbury
before he went to Dr. Berkeley's. He reproached
him, on Mr. Le&s;lie's &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He feared being trouble|&s;ome."</Q>
Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, if a <HI>dog</HI>
came hither with a collar on his neck from Melvil
hou&s;e, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf a mon&s;ter not to entertain
him."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley u&s;ed often to be accu&s;ed of par|tiality
to Scotland, and to his Scotti&s;h friends. Indeed he
had one of the mo&s;t amiable hearts that ever beat in a hu|man
<PB N="xlix" REF="57">
brea&s;t. It mu&s;t have been a <HI>very cold</HI> heart that had
not felt &s;uch amiable, &s;uch re&s;pectful, attentions as Mr.
Berkeley received in his &s;even hundred miles tour through
the unfrequented parts of the Highlands; which was chiefly
performed on foot, although Mr. Berkeley had three hor&s;es
and two &s;ervants, but he often went where they could not
follow him; and at Edinburgh, where he generally pa&s;&s;ed
the fir&s;t part of the St. Andrew's vacation, until the grou&s;e
&s;hooting &s;ea&s;on commenced. Although greatly his &s;u|periors
in learning, Mr. Berkeley had the honour to
rank among&s;t his literary friends, Lord Buchan, the pro|foundly
learned, highly poli&s;hed, all-accompli&s;hed Lord
Monboddo, Mr. M'Kenzie, and Dr. Reid. It is hoped
that the introducing here a <HI>bon mot</HI> of Mr. Berkeley's
may be pardoned. Lord Monboddo, when vi&s;iting Dr.
Berkeley at St. Andrew's, with his u&s;ual exqui&s;ite po|litene&s;s,
pre&s;&s;ed the Doctor and his family to vi&s;it him at
Monboddo, and invited Mr. Berkeley to pa&s;s the next vaca|tion
there. Mrs. Berkeley &s;aid to her &s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Surely you
will go: it will be a wonderful advantage to you, to pa&s;s
&s;o many weeks under the roof of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a man as Lord
Monboddo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. George Berkeley, from its fir&s;t publication, was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ad|mirer of Lord Monboddo's "Ancient Metaphy&s;ics," &s;o as to occa&s;ion Mr. Monck Berkeley's always &s;tyling it his Mother's <HI>&s;econd</HI> Bible. The fir&s;t volume
then only publi&s;hed, Lord Monboddo did Mrs. Berkeley the honour to &s;end
her the &s;econd, &s;aying, he found &s;he under&s;tood it, with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned, worthy Profe&s;&s;or Hunter, a very &s;incerely highly re&s;pected friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley. One of the mo&s;t &s;triking likene&s;&s;es ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius, now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. George Berkeley, in his robes of a throughly upright ju&s;t Judge. It in&s;tantly, on en|tering the room, catches the eye of every &s;tranger who has any &s;kill in painting, and very often of tho&s;e who are hone&s;t enough to declare they have not any &s;kill.</NOTE>."</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Ma|dam,

Mi&s;s Burnett, his Lord&s;hip's truly angelic darling daughter,
no longer an inhabitant of this &s;ublunary world, but gone

after dinner, went down to the ca&s;tle; the family being ab|&s;ent,
he reque&s;ted the porter to permit him to enter, and look
at the pictures. He had from his childhood a wonderfully fine
eye for painting. It is probable he owed it to the &s;o often
hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfather's col|lection
of pictures talked over. The man, who was a tai|lor,
and hard at work, &s;aid he would call his <HI>gewd weef</HI> to
&s;hew him the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>It is hoped the reader will pardon the introducing a dia|logue
between the Gewd Weef and Mr. Berkeley.</P>
<P>Gewd Weef.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Laddie, whence come ye, and
whither gang ye, that ye be come to Lauder?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I came from England, and I am going
to St. Andrew's.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Belike ye come from London.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I came from within about twenty miles of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="63">G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Were ye ever at the greet toon?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, very often.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then ye can tell me what they pay there for
wa&s;hing a <HI>&s;ark,</HI> (i. e. &s;hirt,) for it would be a <HI>great &s;avice</HI>
to me to know. I have always wa&s;hed my Lord's men's
when the family is at the ca&s;tle, and they will pay me
but two pence a &s;ark, and I have been told by a many
that they pay <HI>nine</HI> pence there for every &s;ark; and I &s;adly
want to ken."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You have been mi&s;informed; I never pay
more than four pence for a full trimmed &s;hirt.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well-ee wat, that is but little. I have been
told, it is always <HI>nine</HI> pence."</Q></P>
<P>During this dialogue a young woman entered, with her
hair curled and powdered. Mr. Berkeley had a&s;ked the Gewd
Weef, how many miles it was to St. Andrew's. She re|plied
to that, as to almo&s;t every thing, <Q REND="inline">"Don-a-ken."</Q> On
the appearance of the young woman, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"If you
a&s;k this la&s;&s;ey, &s;he can tell you. She knows muckle
things."</Q> Mr. Berkeley, taking off his hat, made the
enquiry, and was very civilly informed. The young woman,
having di&s;patched her bu&s;ine&s;s with the tailor, went away;
and the dialogue recommenced.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="64">Gewd Weef.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e you 'll gang home this way

<P>Mr. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"About three years, if it plea&s;e God I

<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Three years! for what can ye &s;tay there three
years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be ami&s;s to remark here, that every Scot&s;man thinks it in|cumbent on him to vi&s;it St. Andrew's once in his life, and take a view of the beautiful ruins of the fine&s;t Chri&s;tian temple perhaps ever built by man. During Dr. Berkeley's re&s;idence there, one party arrived &s;o late, that they only &s;aw it by the light of an old horn lantern; but, they would &s;ay they &s;aw it.</NOTE>?</Q></P>

<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am much obliged to you for your good will

think me too young to marry and &s;ettle.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And where be they?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"At the inn in the town.</Q></P>

They 'll haa muckle &s;iller. An, aye, take one of them."</Q></P>
<P>At that in&s;tant a coach and four drove down, when the
Gewd Weef exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What haa we got coming
here?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The carriage in which I came from England.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ye come from England in <HI>that</HI> an-a-carriage;

muckle &s;iller it mu&s;t haa co&s;t your Father to bring ye <HI>aa</HI>

<P>Mr. Berkeley then took his leave of the Gewd Weef, pre|&s;enting
her with a bright half crown, with which &s;he was
much delighted, and wi&s;hed him a <HI>fine Laady</HI> when he
married.</P>
<P>About three years after, Mr. Berkeley accompanied his
worthy friend, Henry Grim&s;ton, E&s;quire, to the famous
conte&s;ted election for York&s;hire, Mr. Grim&s;ton going up
<PB N="lviii" REF="66">
from St. Andrew's, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting the intere&s;ts
of his godfather and friend <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Duncombe, E&s;quire. They
returned by Lauder, when they, together with their learned
lively tutor, Mr. Bruce, whom they agreed to treat with a
&s;ight of York, vi&s;ited the ca&s;tle. Mr. Grim&s;ton archly
a&s;ked the <HI>gewd weef,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"If &s;he had ever &s;een that gentleman
before?"</Q> pointing to Mr. Berkeley; when &s;he exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, that I have; and he gave me <HI>half a croon.</HI>"</Q> Mr.
Berkeley, at his &s;econd vi&s;it, doubled the bounty, and u&s;ed
frequently to laugh with his friends, and &s;ay, that he had
<Q REND="inline">"never met with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a friend <HI>&s;ince;</HI> for that &s;he endea|voured,
according to her idea, to procure him a wife
with a <HI>large</HI> fortune."</Q> Soon after his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the
ca&s;tle, he made a &s;ong, entitled, "The La&s;s of Lauder,"
and had it &s;et to mu&s;ic by Mr. Jenkins, the mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter
at St. Andrew's, but now a teacher of that &s;cience in
London. Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed jocularly to remark, <Q REND="inline">"It is
very certain, that I had not made &s;o <HI>favourable</HI> an im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the <HI>la&s;&s;ey</HI> as I had on the <HI>gewd weef</HI> at Lauder;
for &s;he &s;tayed only to &s;ettle her bu&s;ine&s;s with the tailor,
and then went off."</Q> Some years after, Mr. Berkeley,
being on a vi&s;it at Peten-Weem, and going with his friend
to drink tea at a gentleman's hou&s;e, was a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"If he had
not once been at Lauder ca&s;tle?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have
been twice there."</Q> The female who a&s;ked the que&s;tion
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I had the honour of &s;eeing you there, Sir; and I
&s;hould e&s;teem it an honour if you would drink tea with
<PB N="lix" REF="67">
me during your &s;tay here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley in&s;tantly re|collected that it was the <HI>La&s;s of Lauder,</HI> who did not then
know that &s;he had been <Q REND="inline">"celebrated in &s;ong."</Q> Mr. Berke|ley
was to have left Peten-Weem the next day, but, with
his wonted amiability, po&s;tponed it until the day follow|ing,
that he might vi&s;it the <HI>La&s;s,</HI> who was then married to
the Relief-mini&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Relief-mini&s;ter is one cho&s;en by the people of any place, where
they do not happen to approve the e&s;tabli&s;hed Kirk-mini&s;ter. There are few towns, or even villages, without one. Mr. Berkeley and &s;everal other gentle|men now living, were pre&s;ent, when one of the&s;e good men a&s;&s;erted, <Q REND="inline">"That if Zaccheus the publican had been ble&s;&s;ed with TREW FAAITHE, he had not fallen from the tree into which he had climbed to &s;ee our ble&s;&s;ed Lord pa&s;s by."</Q> All the company exclaimed, that the good little publican did not fall from the tree, but gladly came down to prepare to receive his heavenly gue&s;t.

Several families were
invited to meet him, and a very gay afternoon was &s;pent;
Mr. Berkeley telling Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, that &s;he had made a
better match for her&s;elf than the Gewd Weef at Lauder
Ca&s;tle wi&s;hed to have made for her. Mr. Berkeley, who
had neither vanity nor conceit, here exceeded the truth.
Dr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, a friend of his father, and the worthy Sir C.
B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, a very old friend of his Mother, both urged him
&s;eriou&s;ly to vi&s;it them, to &s;ee after two young ladies of
immen&s;e fortunes in their re&s;pective counties, a&s;&s;uring him
that he mu&s;t infallibly &s;ucceed. Mr. Berkeley's uniform
reply to all &s;uch kind invitations was, <Q REND="inline">"I early re&s;olved, not
to be a fortune-hunter. <HI>I</HI> have no large rent-roll to pro|duce.
<PB N="lx" REF="68">
I will never alarm or di&s;tre&s;s the <HI>anxious</HI> Parents of
any great Fortunes."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, from his youth, from his Mother, was an <HI>he|reditary</HI>
admirer and &s;trenuous advocate for the unfortunate
INJURED Mary, and a dete&s;ter of her cunning, cruel per|&s;ecutor
Elizabeth, reque&s;ted his Father to go to St. Andrew's
by the road of Kinro&s;s, that he might vi&s;it the ca&s;tle of
Loch-Leven; and he &s;pent &s;ome time in wandering about
the ruins; &s;o much as occa&s;ioned his and his &s;ervant's being
benighted on a heath, to the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of his Mo|ther,
who was then unacquainted with the exqui&s;ite, the
amiable ho&s;pitality of the Scotti&s;h nation, high and low,
rich and poor; for Mr. Berkeley could with difficulty force
a &s;hilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a
mile over the heath to put him in the road to Cupar-in-Fife,
where his family were to &s;leep that night, and it was
very late before he and his &s;ervant arrived there.</P>
<P>The next morning they all &s;et out for St. Andrew's, about
eight miles di&s;tant; and enjoyed, the pro&s;pect from the top of
the hill, of the <HI>&s;till</HI> magnificent cathedral, and the tower
of St. Regulus or St. Rule, of which there are four beau|tiful
engravings with Cardinal Bethune's Ca&s;tle by Oliphant,
now exceedingly &s;carce, and very dear, the plates being lo&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that when that ingenious young man died, the plates were &s;old, among&s;t other metal things, for their weight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="lxi" REF="69">
On entering the city at the Argyle Port, your
eye is greeted with a noble wide &s;treet, one mile in
length, and at the lower end of a noble breadth, with &s;tone
hou&s;es, mo&s;t of them disfigured by what is termed a <HI>fore
&s;tair,</HI> that is, an open &s;tair ca&s;e, on the out&s;ide, in a zigzag
manner acro&s;s the front of the hou&s;e, and an huge <HI>&s;midie,</HI> a
not inelegant name for a filthy thing, a dunghill; no court,
no pali&s;ade, no brea&s;t-wall or railing, before even the be&s;t
hou&s;es, excepting only what was once the palace of James
the Fir&s;t of England; but it is not meant here to give an
imperfect de&s;cription of this once beautiful magnificent city,
which has been &s;o well done by Bo&s;well and Pennant, be|fore
John Knox <HI>preached</HI> it into ruins, by removing an
archbi&s;hop, dean, and eight re&s;ident prebendaries, who fed
the hungry, clothed the naked, and admini&s;tered to the
wants of the &s;ick and needy, who are all now &s;tarving. On
a full &s;ight of this dreary de&s;erted city, Mr. Berkeley wept
to think that he was to remain, if God &s;pared his life, three
long years in it. The hou&s;e taken for Dr. Berkeley's fa|mily,
the be&s;t then to be had in the town, was without
even a back door, the covetous wretch who owned it having
&s;old a little &s;pot behind it to a gentleman at the next hou&s;e;
&s;o the door was &s;topped up. Dr. Berkeley, &s;eeing Mr.
Berkeley &s;o deeply affected, and Principal Wat&s;on, who&s;e
learning had induced him to prefer St. Andrew's to a fo|reign
univer&s;ity, having died a very few days before, made
Mr. Berkeley the offer of returning to England the next
<PB N="lxii" REF="70">
day; for which he felt great gratitude, but, with his wonted
&s;trength of mind, declared, that, let him &s;uffer what he
might, he would remain his three years. It is but ju&s;tice
to &s;ay, that Mr. Berkeley &s;hed more tears at leaving St.
Andrew's, than he drew &s;ighs at entering it.</P>
<P>So deeply was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <HI>lawful</HI> authority engraven
on Mr. Berkeley's mind, that during the three years and a
half he was a &s;tudent at the univer&s;ity of St. Andrew, he
never would go out for even two or three nights to his no|ble,
truly amiable friend the Earl of Leven's, at Melvil
Hou&s;e, without going to <HI>a&s;k leave out,</HI> as it is termed, of
the Principal Dr. M'Cormick, whom Mr. Berkeley always
called, <Q REND="inline">"our polite, amiable Principal;"</Q> or, in his ab&s;ence,
of the Profe&s;&s;or, who u&s;ed politely to &s;ay, that, <Q REND="inline">"he living
in his Father's hou&s;e, it was needle&s;s to trouble him&s;elf."</Q>
His con&s;tant reply was, that <Q REND="inline">"the &s;tatutes, which he had
promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve, <HI>enjoined</HI> it."</Q></P>
<P>It is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which
Mr. Berkeley met with during his re&s;idence at St. Andrew's
may be pardoned. A very few days before the term began
in autumn, Mr. Berkeley, who was at that time a very
keen &s;port&s;man, was told by the &s;on of the Profe&s;&s;or of
Medicine, a very &s;en&s;ible young man, now &s;ettled in Ca|nada,
that, if he wi&s;hed it, he could lead him to a place
where Ptermagants abounded. The youths &s;et out,
<PB N="lxiii" REF="71">
marched &s;everal miles; night overtook them, and they
wandered in a very dark evening, unable to find the road.
At length the moon began to appear, and pre&s;ented to
their view a figure all in white. Mr. Berkeley &s;oon learnt
to &s;peak Scotch &s;o perfectly, as at any time throughout his
life, to be mi&s;taken, whenever he wi&s;hed it, for a true
Scot; which often amu&s;ed his friends, or &s;trangers, of that
country, which his Mother ever termed <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Land of kind
Ho&s;pitality;</HI>"</Q> a proof whereof will &s;oon appear.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley acco&s;ted the young woman with, <Q REND="inline">"La&s;&s;ey,
whither gang ye?</Q></P>
<P>La&s;&s;ey.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To yonder hou&s;e, Laddie.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Can we get lodging there to night?</Q></P>
<P>La&s;&s;ey.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hoo can ye a&s;k that que&s;tion with the&s;e wea|pons
in your hands? They <HI>mu&s;t</HI> lodge ye.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"God forbid that we &s;hould attempt to <HI>force</HI>
any one to lodge <HI>us;</HI> and, to convince you how harmle&s;s
we are, I will in&s;tantly di&s;charge my piece."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley immediately fired off a fine double-barreled
gun, and reque&s;ted his friend to follow his example. They
then e&s;corted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the
hou&s;e; where Mr. Berkeley refu&s;ed to enter until permi&s;&s;ion
was obtained by their kind guide, who went in alone. In
a minute out ru&s;hed <Q REND="inline">"a bevey of fair nymphs,"</Q> more than
<PB N="lxiv" REF="72">
twenty, with a matron in the rear, who very wi&s;ely began
examining them, how they came on that wild heath at
that hour; who, and what they were. Mr. Berkeley, being
&s;poke&s;man, a&s;&s;ured them that they were hone&s;t young men,
&s;tudents of St. Andrew's. Still they were di&s;tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>At length, fortunately for them, a young woman e&s;pied a
youth in the highland dre&s;s, and, going up to him, a&s;ked
<Q REND="inline">"Who he was?"</Q></P>
<P>Servant.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who? why I am &s;ervant to that tall gen|tleman.</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And who is he?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who? why Mr. Berkeley, &s;econdary at St.
Andrew's.</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Where does he come from, to keep
a &s;ervant at college?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, from England."</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"From what part of England?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, from Canterbury. My Ma&s;ter's Fa|ther
is one of the Prebendaries there, and is a gentleman
of <HI>great</HI> family."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed to laugh when relating this conver&s;a|tion,
and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"All M'Nicoll's account of my Father's <HI>dig|nity</HI>
in the <HI>church</HI> availed <HI>me no more</HI> than they will do in
<PB N="lxv" REF="73">
the world of &s;pirits."</Q> But luckily &s;ome one a&s;ked Mr.
Berkeley's highlander, <Q REND="inline">"Who was his ma&s;ter's companion?"</Q>
to which he, being irritated, replied, <Q REND="inline">"What does that
&s;ignify? He is &s;on to Dr. Flint of St. Andrew's."</Q> The
magical name of Flint, as Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"acted
like a charm."</Q> Dr. Flint is a mo&s;t incomparable phy&s;i|cian.
Mr. Flint was immediately examined and <HI>cro&s;s exa|mined;</HI>
and it was determined to admit them, they deli|vering
up their guns to the nymphs. Mr. Berkeley, with
his u&s;ual elegant gallantry, in&s;tantly delivered his into the
hands of their kind guide. They then went into the
hou&s;e, being almo&s;t &s;tarved with cold, and &s;adly tired. Plenty
of food, and a good fire, &s;oon re-animated them. Still
they &s;aw nothing but females, all clothed in white. No
male appeared. The men were attending the corn. At
length, they all agreed, that it was time to &s;et off&mdash;me|lancholy
news, as Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, to a couple of
young men. Whither were they to go? <Q REND="inline">"Could not the
beaux e&s;cort them,"</Q> they replied, <Q REND="inline">"to a neighbouring har|ve&s;t-home,
to a dance?"</Q> Mr. Berkeley, who was a remarka|bly
fine dancer, and loved it exceedingly, jumped up, for|got
all the fatigues of the day, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that he and his
friend would attend them."</Q> Their ho&s;pitable and very &s;en|&s;ible
ho&s;te&s;s replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir! it is not &s;uch a ball as you
have been u&s;ed to in England; there will be only far|mers'
daughters. I will have the plea&s;ure of endeavouring
to entertain you and Mr. Flint here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="74">
with his u&s;ual engaging politene&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"There will be
<HI>your</HI> daughters, Madam, and our kind conductre&s;s to your
ho&s;pitable roof."</Q> The young men went and danced in
the barn till four in the morning; &s;lept &s;oundly, as may be
gue&s;&s;ed, until near noon; took an excellent <HI>Scotch</HI> break|fa&s;t,
(even Dr. John&s;on liked the <HI>breakfa&s;ts</HI> in Scotland;)
and, after inviting his kind ho&s;te&s;s and her &s;on to dine at
his Father's hou&s;e in St. Andrew's, when either bu&s;ine&s;s
or plea&s;ure called them to that ancient city, took their
leave. The young man went once or twice to Dr. Berke|ley's.
Mr. Berkeley, who was born with what is com|monly,
but often fal&s;ely, called a princely &s;pirit, although
not to a princely fortune, did not think a few grateful
&s;peeches an adequate return for being re&s;cued from &s;leeping
among the heather on the heath; but &s;ent his worthy landlady
&s;ome fine prints, elegantly framed and glazed, to adorn her
parlour, with which he had great plea&s;ure in finding &s;he
was much delighted. Some of Mr. Berkeley's intimates
among the &s;tudents laughed at him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Berke|ley,
<HI>you</HI> have lain out a night without leave."</Q></P>
<P>The great Charles Le&s;lie, the famous controver&s;ial writer,
u&s;ed to &s;ay of Mr. Berkeley's maternal great-grandfather,
the celebrated Francis Cherry, E&s;quire, of Shotte&s;brooke
Hou&s;e, in Berk&s;hire, that he believed him to have the mo&s;t
accurate, the &s;ounde&s;t judgement, that God had, in the&s;e
latter days, be&s;towed on man. A multitude of in&s;tances
<PB N="lxvii" REF="75">
might be adduced to prove, that although Mr. Berkeley in|herited
but little of Mr. Cherry's immen&s;e fortune, he cer|tainly
did of a better portion than money.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, on his return from his highland tour, told
his family, that he might, he believed, have lived &s;even
years there, on the merits of the ring &s;ent by the old Che|valier
de St. George to Mr. Cherry, when he &s;ent Mr. Le&s;|lie,
at his own expence, to Rome, to try to convert him
from Popery. Mr. Le&s;lie wrote Mr. Cherry word from
Rome, that an attempt to make the &s;un ri&s;e in the WEST
would be equally &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He felt a <HI>little</HI> a&s;hamed, that the
ring &s;hould be <HI>&s;o</HI> well known in the Highlands, and that
<HI>he, the pre&s;umptive heir to it,</HI> had never &s;een it more than
once or twice in his life."</Q> He reque&s;ted his Mother and
Aunt to gratify him with a &s;ight of it, that he might be
able in future to give a <HI>better</HI> account of the famous relic.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See before, p. xix.</NOTE>, that one of Mr. Berkeley's

In one of the letters he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I have had the opi|nion of the attorney and &s;olicitor general on my cau&s;e; but I <HI>cannot re&s;t</HI> &s;ati&s;|fied till I hear what old Cherry &s;ays about it."</Q> Mr. Cherry was at law with King James when he fled. A con&s;iderable part of Shotte&s;brooke e&s;tate lies in Wind&s;or Fore&s;t. Mr. Cherry had planted &s;ome young trees, and was inclo&s;ing them. The King rode by, and a&s;ked the labourer, <Q REND="inline">"Who bid him do it."</Q> He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"My Ma&s;ter, plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It does <HI>not</HI> plea&s;e me,"</Q> replied the King; <Q REND="inline">"and <HI>I</HI> order you to throw up the inclo&s;ure directly."</Q> He did &s;o. Mr. Cherry's old &s;teward informed his Ma&s;ter immediately of it; who ordered that the &s;ame labourer &s;hould directly &s;et about inclo&s;ing it again. The next hunting-morning his Maje&s;ty found him at work, and a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"How he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"His Ma&s;|ter had ordered it."</Q> The King commanded him to undo his work at his peril; which the poor fellow did; and Mr. Cherry, who when in the country acted as a ju&s;tice of the peace, committed him to Reading gaol, and com|menced a &s;uit again&s;t the King. Luckily for this poor man, he could not only read, but write; being clerk of the pari&s;h of White Waltham, where, and in many &s;urrounding pari&s;hes, Mr. Cherry had large farms, and always found and made his tenants find work for the indu&s;trious labourers. When the poor inno|cent culprit reached the gaol, he wrote a long and intere&s;ting letter to the King, telling his Maje&s;ty, that as his good old Ma&s;ter had now turned him off from his work for obeying him, he hoped his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed, in his <HI>con&s;ide|ration,</HI> to &s;end him &s;ome money to keep him <HI>comfortably</HI> in gaol; and, after much more curious matter, &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf <Q REND="inline">"his Maje&s;ty's poor, pitiful, patient, lamentable &s;ervant, JOHN HONE."</Q> This letter reached the King about three weeks before he left the kingdom, when Mr. Cherry immediately liberated hone&s;t John, and took care that he had every comfort during his im|pri&s;onment; Mr. Cherry having &s;ent the man to gaol only to teach the Mo|narch what he might <HI>not</HI> do. Mr. Berkeley had for &s;ome years been writing a treati&s;e on "The Prerogatives of the Crown;" and one volume was ready for the pre&s;s at the time of his death. How far he would have approved his ance&s;tor's conduct in this matter is uncertain. This tran&s;action is &s;omewhat differently told in the old ballad of "The King and Mr. Cherry." This gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in Kent, near the &s;eat of the grandfather of the late worthy Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, by whom, and his lady, every humane, amiable attention was paid him that his de&s;perate &s;ituation would admit of. His death was the more to be lamented by his excellent &s;on, as, on the coroner's inque&s;t, it appeared to have happened through roguery, the verdict being, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Killed by the footboard having been mended with old ru&s;ty nails.</HI>"</Q> On going down the hill, the coachman of cour&s;e pre&s;&s;ing more on the footboard than on even ground, it gave way, and he fell down among the hor&s;es; who immediately ran away in half a dozen different direc|tions, threw off the po&s;tillion, and broke the chariot entirely to pieces. When they &s;topped, it was a quarter of an hour before Mr. Cherry's valet de chambre, who was attending his Ma&s;ter on hor&s;eback, could di&s;cover life either in his Ma&s;ter, Mr. Partridge, of the I&s;le of Ely, to whom Mr. cherry was guardian, or any of the &s;ervants. The moment he found his Ma&s;ter was not dead, he rode off to town, to carry down the Queen's &s;erjeant-&s;urgeon, and &s;ent off from London an expre&s;s to Mr. Cherry at Shotte&s;brooke. On the arrival of the &s;urgeon, he a&s;ked Mr. Cherry, <Q REND="inline">"Where he felt pain?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Sir! where do I <HI>not</HI> feel pain?"</Q> A piece of the plate gla&s;s of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a man's hand. Mr. Cherry lived only four days after the accident, the &s;urgeon &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He is the noble&s;t ruin I ever &s;aw. I never beheld &s;uch a man of eighty-three: but for this ac|cident, he would probably have attained to the age of old Parr."</Q> Mr. Cherry's &s;trength of body and mind were equal at eighty-three to what they were at thirty-three. This account of Mr. Cherry's death, and Mr. Partridge's almo&s;t miraculous e&s;cape, is very differently and very erroneou&s;ly related in a work printed about &s;eventy years ago, by a gentleman of fortune in Devon&s;hire. Mr. Cherry's lady's father, John Whitefield, E&s;quire, of Ives Place, near Maidenhead, was thrown from his hor&s;e, and drowned in the Thames, when taking an airing one evening near his own hou&s;e, at an advanced age. Mr. Berkeley's Mother's paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his hor&s;e, as he was riding one morning near his own hou&s;e, at the age of eighty-one. The lady of the celebrated Francis Cherry, E&s;quire, the patron of Thomas Hearne, one of his under-footmen, was the elde&s;t of the five co-heire&s;&s;es of John Finch, E&s;quire, of Fienes Court, Berks. In the cloaths of this gentle|man was King Charles the Second dre&s;&s;ed, when he e&s;caped with Lady Jane Lane. Oh! &s;hame to <HI>royal</HI> gratitude, that this lady was not made a Duche&s;s, to de&s;cend to her heirs female as well as male. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that he had worn Mr. Finch's old cloaths;"</Q> Mr. Finch, having gone down a few weeks before, to marry the beautiful rich heire&s;s of Sir John Chapman, aged fifteen. An exqui&s;itely fine very &s;mall miniature of this Lady, by Pettitote, is in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Monck Berkeley's Aunt, Mrs. Frin&s;ham; it having been pre|&s;ented to her, by Mr. Berkeley's Mother, at Mrs. Berkeley's marriage.</NOTE>, as he was <HI>nobly</HI> by his Fa|ther's,

what is called, I think, very erroneou&s;ly, <HI>family pride;</HI> for

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for the Writer of this Preface not to pay
a &s;mall tribute of gratitude to the memory of that uncom|monly
judicious, amiable, young gentleman, the late Me|redith
Price, Junior, E&s;quire; to who&s;e wi&s;dom, prudence,

or <HI>murdered.</HI> During their re&s;idence at the univer&s;ity of
St. Andrew's, Mr. Berkeley was one day attacked by Mr.

attention. Mr. Berkeley defended him&s;elf by declaring,
that, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o far from <HI>&s;peaking</HI> &s;lightingly of the young wo|man,

(When a youth, it u&s;ed to be &s;aid of Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"He

la&s;t outrage was too much for Mr. Berkeley. It rou&s;ed
<Q REND="inline">"all the noble blood of the Berkeleys in his veins."</Q> He
left the room, went home, immediately retired to his
apartment, wrote, and &s;ent the challenge. His next care
was to pitch upon a &s;econd. He determined it &s;hould not
be his dear friend Mr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, le&s;t it &s;hould embroil
him with his excellent noble Father Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. That

to a gentleman, one of his companions at Eton, to whom
he had been particularly attached from twelve years old,
and who had manifold more obligations than Mr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">;
he was many months an inmate at Dr. Berkeley's. On
Mr. Berkeley's reque&s;ting him to attend him the next
morning, he hummed a little while, and at length &s;tam|mered
out, <Q REND="inline">"That he was afraid whether or no his <HI>papa</HI>
might approve of it; &s;o begged his <HI>dear</HI> Berkeley would
<HI>excu&s;e him.</HI>"</Q> Why his Father &s;hould di&s;approve it,
puzzled all who knew his character: it could not be on ac|count
of breaking God's holy law; for, Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> would
become wretched if he &s;uppo&s;ed any body &s;u&s;pected him of
believing in God: indeed the conduct of this <HI>fine</HI> Mr.

it. The de&s;cription of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, in <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;hire, where
his great e&s;tate lies, is this, <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time you are in

like him much le&s;s; and the <HI>third,</HI> you long to kick him
out of the room&mdash;as he de&s;erves."</Q> Mr. Berkeley re&s;olved
not to call on any friend, Engli&s;h or Scotti&s;h, who&s;e for|tunes
it might injure, the certain con&s;equence being expul|&s;ion
from the univer&s;ity; went to Mr. Price, who owed no
obligation of any &s;ort, except permi&s;&s;ion to attend the &s;er|vice
of the Church of England at Dr. Berkeley's private
chapel; and of cour&s;e being &s;ometimes invited to a din|ner,
&s;upper, or dance, in common with other Engli&s;h
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="82">
and Scotti&s;h young gentlemen. Mr. Price in&s;tantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"He was entirely at Mr. Berkeley's &s;ervice; but hoped
the matter might be accommodated without fighting."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley a&s;&s;ured him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that was impo&s;&s;ible.</HI>"</Q> They
therefore proceeded to the place, where this wi&s;e young
gentleman again urged the matter &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, &s;o eloquently,
that Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> offered to make any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that Mr.
Berkeley &s;hould require. Mr. Berkeley from his infancy,
although a little fury, was &s;urely the mo&s;t ready to pardon
of all the fallen children of Adam; in&s;omuch that his Mo|ther
u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"That if any one murdered him, and he
lived only three minutes, he would <HI>freely</HI> forgive them;"</Q>
con&s;tantly adding, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! he does not inherit that from
<HI>me.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley, however, was &s;o exa&s;perated at the
brutal ra&s;cality of, <Q REND="inline">"I may &s;ay whatever I plea&s;e, for you
DARE not fight,"</Q> &amp;c. that for once he appeared inexora|ble.
The ground was mea&s;ured, the pi&s;tols were delivered,
and the &s;words laid ready, when Mr. Price, in&s;tead of
giving the word to fire, &s;tepped in between the combatants,
and &s;o wi&s;ely, &s;o pathetically conjured Mr. Berkeley to ac|cept
Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s offers of making <HI>every</HI> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that,
at length, Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted &s;weetne&s;s, threw
away his pi&s;tol, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, you &s;hall beg
my pardon in no other way than &s;aying, in Mr. Price's
pre&s;ence, before the gentlemen in who&s;e company you
in&s;ulted me, that you are &s;orry you provoked me."</Q> So
this frightful affair ended. But not the gratitude of Mr.
<PB N="lxxv" REF="83">
Berkeley and his parents. Providence had placed Mr.
Price in a &s;ituation to render other return than polite and
friendly attentions out of the que&s;tion. When Mr. Price
went to France, they felt unfeigned plea&s;ure in giving him
letters of introduction to &s;everal very worthy French fami|lies
with whom they were intimate, which rendered his
<HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> in that once delightful country very plea&s;ant. May
that amiable young gentleman be now rejoicing in one &s;till
plea&s;anter!</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be a&s;ked by &s;ome, <Q REND="inline">"With all the&s;e
amiable qualities, and great virtues, had Mr. Berkeley
no vices?"</Q> Alas! yes. Mr. Berkeley fell, as David
fell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no hi&s;tory through the whole Bible that affords more <HI>diver&s;ion</HI> to the pert, ignorant, young <HI>&s;ucking</HI> Athei&s;t, than the lamentable fall of David.

His children, guilty of ince&s;t, murder, horrid deceit, and re|bellion, puni&s;hed him even to his extreme old age.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible here to avoid relating an anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's celebrated learned grandfather.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Berkeley, walking down Pall Mall, with his darling friend Bi&s;hop Ben&s;on (whom he u&s;ed to call Titus, <Q REND="inline">"the delight of human kind,"</Q>) there ru&s;hed out of the Star and Garter four or five <HI>very witty bucks</HI> of that day. One exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"A brace of Bi&s;hops!" (the bi&s;hops then wore purple coats:) "let us put them up."</Q> Bi&s;hop Ben&s;on, being a much lighter man than Bi&s;hop Berkeley, in&s;tantly ran off to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way. The Wits immedi|ately made a circle, and inclo&s;ed poor Bi&s;hop Berkeley, whom they thus <HI>wit|tily</HI> acco&s;ted, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, my Lord, what does your Lord&s;hip think of King Da|vid? David loved a pretty girl, my Lord."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, I think that King David was a <HI>very great &s;inner,</HI> as <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> are; but God gave him grace to repent of his &s;in, as, <HI>I &s;incerely hope,</HI> he will to YOU and ME."</Q> They all &s;lank off, like <HI>pitiful fools,</HI> excepting one, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly, heartily be your Lord&s;hip's pardon."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame very ready and pointed wit Mr. Berkeley &s;hewed on a dif|ferent occa&s;ion. When introduced to the late Lord Mansfield by his Lord|&s;hip's de&s;ire, he eyed him about half a minute; when Mr. Berkeley expected him to &s;ay, what many lords and learned men had often &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"that they were happy to &s;ee the grand&s;on of their excellent old Friend,"</Q> Lord
Mansfield &s;aid,
<Q>"To Berkeley every virtue under heaven."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley in&s;tantly replied,<Q>"How &s;weet an Ovid was in Murray lo&s;t."</Q>
Lord Mansfield &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You are, Sir, a very polite young gentleman, indeed. Aye, Sir, Mr. Pope was very partial to me;"</Q> took Berkeley under the arm, and walked off with him. All Tunbridge talked of Mr. Berkeley's ready wit. Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends, on hearing it, &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, we are afraid the old Prelate was a Fore&s;taller, and has left none of the&s;e VIRTUES to you."</Q></P></NOTE>&mdash;as Solomon fell;&mdash;but, <HI>with them,</HI> he received
grace <PB N="lxxvi" REF="84"> to repent, and mercy to con&s;ole his throughly
humbled, penitent, contrite &s;pirit. Mr. Berkeley had not &s;ufficiently
attended to that admonition of the Wi&s;e King,
<Q REND="inline">"U&s;e not much the company of a woman that is a
&s;inger."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's enthu&s;ia&s;tic love of mu&s;ic drew him into
the <PB N="lxxvii" REF="85"> &s;nares of the celebrated Mrs.
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. His delight in real &s;terling wit
cau&s;ed him to fall into the
<Q REND="inline">"deep ditch"</Q> <HI>long</HI> digging for him by Lady
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. From both it plea&s;ed the great
MERCY of God to re&s;cue him. For more than four years before his death, his
lovely &s;pirit was &s;upplicating for that pardon promi&s;ed by our
all-gracious Redeemer to ALL who turn to him in faith&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Him that cometh unto ME I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley, reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other
advan|tages, con&s;idered him&s;elf as a much greater &s;inner than any of his
young friends, who had not been &s;o favoured by Providence, could po&s;&s;ibly
be. But it plea&s;ed the God of Mercy to &s;peak peace to his wounded &s;pirit;

<Q REND="inline">"I have heard thy prayer; I have &s;een thy tears,"</Q>
I&s;aiah xxxviii. 5; and, for &s;ome weeks before his death, to pour the balm
of perfect peace into his dear wounded &s;pirit, and mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly to

<P>Mr. Berkeley had too &s;trong an under&s;tanding not to be|lieve
with his <HI>whole</HI> heart and mind the truths, the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI>
truths, revealed in the Go&s;pel of Peace. He was ble&s;&s;ed
with an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> mind, as has been &s;aid of a very great man
&s;till living, as much Mr. Berkeley's &s;uperior in years as in
rank. <Q REND="inline">"His Lord&s;hip is <HI>too</HI> hone&s;t to endeavour to warp
the Go&s;pel to <HI>his</HI> life, and he <HI>feels</HI> every day that they are

<PB N="lxxviii" REF="86">
ever <HI>&s;peaking</HI> the roughe&s;t."</Q> There Mr. Berkeley re&s;em|bled
<HI>not</HI> the noble Peer; for he was never known from a

him was every &s;ervant he ever had from the age of &s;even|teen,

ever felt, the &s;urvivor &s;till feels, the deepe&s;t gratitude&mdash;this
poor creature one night robbed Mr. Berkeley in the
Temple. On his being pre&s;&s;ed to appear again&s;t him, he
<HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> refu&s;ed. When &s;trongly urged that it was <HI>right,</HI>

But to return. To &s;ay that Mr. Berkeley's &s;ervants
loved him, is too feeble an expre&s;&s;ion. His own, and the
&s;ervants of his Father's family, in general old in his &s;ervice,
almo&s;t idolized him. His genero&s;ity, his conde&s;cending
goodne&s;s to the meane&s;t &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, was &s;o en|gaging,
that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he
vi&s;ited at his Father's. He had been very early taught,
that, although it had plea&s;ed Providence to place him in a
different &s;tation of life from his Father's &s;ervants, yet that
he mu&s;t ever treat them with kind civility. He and his
brother were always made, whil&s;t children, to take off their
hat to the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant and wa&s;her-woman who pa&s;&s;ed
them in the village: and &s;o habitual was it to Mr. Berkeley
to be <Q REND="inline">"<HI>courteous to all men,</HI>"</Q> that when he gave orders to
his &s;ervant, a &s;tranger to him would not have &s;uppo&s;ed he
had been &s;peaking to his own dome&s;tic; yet, wonderful to
relate, he had one &s;ervant, who actually had a de&s;ire to
lie in wait to murder him: but he was an Italian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. xxxvii.</NOTE>. This
may be a warning to Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h gentlemen to be le&s;s
fond of foreign &s;ervants. Mr. Berkeley, wanting a &s;ervant
at a time when few were in London; a per&s;on who owed
Mr. Berkeley much gratitude earne&s;tly recommended this
villain. Mr. Berkeley objected, wi&s;hing either an Engli&s;h
or Scotchman; always thinking it wrong to employ fo|reigners
to the detriment of our own countrymen, he how|ever
yielded. Dr. Berkeley, at his return from vi&s;iting
his &s;on in town, &s;aid to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I think your &s;on
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="90">
&s;eems to have got a Devil in the form of a fine tall fel|low."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"What does he do?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Nothing, I believe.
But &s;uch a pair of diabolical eyes I never &s;aw before in
my life."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, ever anxious for her idol, wrote
to her &s;on, who, with his u&s;ual benignity, replied, <Q REND="inline">"The
poor fellow, to be &s;ure, is not hand&s;ome; nor has he a
very benign countenance; which made my Father think
him diabolical: but he does every thing that I want,
although he is not like Ritchie, or M'Nicol."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley was once ordered to the &s;ea, a day
or or two before he &s;et out, accompanied by his excellent
unwearied friend H. Grim&s;ton, E&s;quire, he told this &s;er|vant,
that, <Q REND="inline">"as he wi&s;hed to lounge and change his po&s;|ture
frequently, and as he could not accommodate
three in the chai&s;e, it being &s;ummer time, he &s;hould
go down on the top of the coach."</Q> This <HI>Signor</HI> re|&s;ented,
as <HI>&s;uch</HI> an indignity, that, on his arrival, he
utterly refu&s;ed to act at all; &s;o that, but for Mr. Grim|&s;ton's
&s;ervant, Mr. Berkeley mu&s;t have been exceed|ingly
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. His ill humour increa&s;ing daily, Mr.
Berkeley at length di&s;charged him without the lea&s;t anger
or reproach. The &s;weetne&s;s of his nature never &s;uffered
his anger to ri&s;e again&s;t an inferior. My &s;uperiors, he u&s;ed
ever to &s;ay, &s;hall <HI>feel</HI> it if <HI>they</HI> treat me improperly. This
wretch, in&s;tead of returning to London the next morning,
&s;tayed the whole of the next day, and when he did &s;et off,
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"He had waited all that day to murder his ma&s;ter,
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="91">
but he found it was in vain, for that he kept clo&s;e."</Q> It
providentially happened, that Mr. Berkeley's hor&s;e had
picked up a nail, and he could not ride into the country,
as was his con&s;tant cu&s;tom, to drink milk from the cow,
morning and evening; neither did he go to the library or
rooms that day; which Mr. Berkeley, when mentioning it,
looked upon as the mercy of an all-gracious, over-ruling,
particular Providence, in which he ever believed, ever
tru&s;ted, and was never di&s;appointed. Mr. Berkeley, not
having any Italian blood in his veins, could form no idea
of this villain's &s;pirit of revenge. He was immediately re|placed
by a very worthy hone&s;t Engli&s;hman, Mr. William
Morfey, for who&s;e attentive, ince&s;&s;ant care Mr. Berkeley
felt him&s;elf &s;o much indebted, that &s;ome little time before
his lamented death, he reque&s;ted of his Father and Mother,
<Q REND="inline">"that he might remain in their family as long as &s;ervice
&s;hould be agreeable to him,"</Q> although he had a compe|tency
without it.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid relating here a little
circum&s;tance, that will &s;hew the contra&s;t between the En|gli&s;hman
and the Italian. For &s;ome time before Mr. Berke|ley's
di&s;&s;olution, finding him&s;elf unable to fit up through
the day, he ro&s;e not until after the family had dined, that
he might enjoy the &s;ociety of his friends in the afternoon.
He con&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervant to eat his dinner in com|fort,
ordering him not to hurry him&s;elf, and not to return
until he rang his bell. One day his bell rang, and Mr.
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="92">
Berkeley's Mother, conceiving that the &s;ervant had not
dined, went to the top of the kitchen &s;tairs, and told the
&s;ervant, &s;he would go up and &s;ee what his Ma&s;ter wanted,
and if &s;he could not get it, ring for him. He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Madam, I mu&s;t go my&s;elf."</Q> The hou&s;ekeeper and
the other &s;ervants urged him to &s;tay, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"You have
but <HI>one &s;ingle</HI> mouthful to fini&s;h; do pray eat it; Mr.
Berkeley is never impatient, he will wait."</Q> He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No; I will not &s;tay to eat it.</HI>"</Q> His Mother once recom|mending
to his care a mo&s;t affectionate, tender-hearted
&s;ervant, her old hou&s;ekeeper, who came into the family
when Mr. Berkeley was a lad, to keep in his family, if it
plea&s;ed God to &s;pare him to &s;ettle; he lifted up his fine
eyes, and replied, in the tendere&s;t tone of voice, <Q REND="inline">"My
deare&s;t Mother, there is no occa&s;ion for <HI>you</HI> to recom|mend
Mrs. Mar&s;h to <HI>me.</HI>"</Q> When Mr. Berkeley's ex|qui&s;itely
fine picture, pre&s;ented to his Mother by his
beloved friend Mr. Peters, arrived at Dr. Berkeley's, this
amiable-hearted woman ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the unpacking
it, and, on &s;eeing it, &s;unk motionle&s;s upon it. Heartfelt grati|tude
forces the Writer of this Preface to celebrate the ince&s;&s;ant
unwearied attention of the two above named &s;ervants, as
al&s;o of the very worthy Mrs. Jane Godwin, who has for
many years been the happy dome&s;tic of Mr. Berkeley's in|comparably
kind, generous, excellent Aunt, Mrs. Frin|&s;ham,
for the delightful alacrity, and unwearied a&s;&s;iduity,
with which they endeavoured ince&s;&s;antly to alleviate Mr.
Berkeley's intolerable, <HI>all but in&s;upportable,</HI> bodily &s;ufferings,
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="93">
as indeed did every other &s;ervant in the family: for all
which &s;ufferings Mr. Berkeley repeatedly returned hearty
thanks to God, frequently &s;aying to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I would
not have been without them for all this world has to
give, as, I am per&s;uaded, nothing &s;hort of what I have
&s;uffered could have brought <HI>me,</HI> as I <HI>ought,</HI> to come to

to feel le&s;s need of the atonement.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to omit here my mo&s;t grateful acknow|ledgements
to many amiable-hearted per&s;ons in the inferior
&s;tations in life, to whom Mr. Berkeley was only known by
his almo&s;t divine philanthropy, and by his &s;evere &s;ufferings&mdash;at
Ha&s;tings, at Dover, and at Cheltenham&mdash;who &s;eemed to
vie with each other, who &s;hould be mo&s;t active in <HI>endeavour|ing</HI>
to lighten the di&s;tre&s;s of a poor mi&s;erable &s;tomach, that
for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley frequently, for days together, did not retain any thing taken into his &s;tomach for one minute; which occa&s;ioned one of the mo&s;t emi|nent Phy&s;icians to pronounce po&s;itively, that the pa&s;&s;age into the &s;tomach was &s;topped, and mu&s;t be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen. This was not the ca&s;e; as &s;ometimes, for two or three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, plainly ap|peared. Mr. Berkeley was one of the mo&s;t temperate of men, never, from the age of fifteen, ta&s;ting a mor&s;el of any food between his meals; no &s;and|wich; no &s;oup; nor any thing el&s;e, even if he did not dine until &s;ix o'clock; and very rarely ate any &s;upper when he dined at the old-fa&s;hioned hour of three at his Father's hou&s;e.</NOTE>.
Per&s;ons are often puni&s;hed in kind.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By what things a
man &s;inneth, by the &s;ame al&s;o &s;hall he be tormented,"</Q>
&s;peaks the Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxvi" REF="94">
Mr. Berkeley never was an epicure a moment of his life;
frequently, when the family dined out, and he did not
choo&s;e to accompany them, Mrs. Berkeley would a&s;k him,
<Q REND="inline">"What &s;he &s;hould order for his dinner?"</Q> His con&s;tant re|ply
was, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam, whatever they have in
the &s;ervants' hall will do for me."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But, my dear, they
have not any thing yet ordered."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, then, if it is
quite convenient, a neck of mutton and broth, and &s;uet
dumplings, and turnips;"</Q> of which he con&s;tantly ate the
ab&s;olute &s;crag; which often occa&s;ioned his mother's telling
him, <Q REND="inline">"However you may torment your wife, if ever you
marry, it will not be as an epicure."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley wi&s;hed exceedingly to have gone to Dover
immediately, on his being ordered the third time to the
&s;ea, that, together with &s;ea bathing, he might have enjoyed
the delightful &s;ociety of his old, his beloved, his &s;incerely
re&s;pected friends, the excellent Sir Robert and Lady Lau|rie,
and their throughly amiable &s;on and daughter; but
his father wi&s;hed him to make choice of Ha&s;tings; and Mr.
Berkeley was the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> obedient of &s;ons. As the autumn
advanced, the want of a warm &s;ea-bath obliged him to quit
Ha&s;tings, and he repaired to Dover, accompanied by his
excellent relation above named, Mrs. Frin&s;ham; where he
received &s;uch amiable, &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant attentions, from the
lovely family of Laurie, the angelic Mrs. Firebrace, and
the very worthy Mrs. and Mi&s;s Payne&mdash;although it were
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="95">
impo&s;&s;ible, even if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mines of Peru and
Mexico, to repay their kindne&s;s, yet mu&s;t it ever be, whil&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of life, regi&s;tered in the retentive grateful memory
of the Editor; and may HE who rewardeth <HI>every one ac|cording
to, although not for,</HI> their good works, reward the&s;e
amiable friends an hundred, a thou&s;and fold, in TIME, and
through the countle&s;s ages of ETERNITY, is a prayer offered
<HI>daily</HI> at the throne of that God who <HI>hears</HI> and <HI>an&s;wers</HI> prayer,
as is often happily experienced by tho&s;e who <HI>believe</HI> and
<HI>tru&s;t</HI> HIS gracious promi&s;es, revealed in the Holy Scriptures.
The mention of the&s;e particular kind, old, intimate friends
of Mr. Berkeley and his family, does not prevent the
Writer from feeling the &s;incere&s;t gratitude to numberle&s;s
other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of Dover,
who, high and low, &s;eemed to &s;tudy who &s;hould be mo&s;t
forward in &s;hewing every <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> attention to Mr. Berkeley,
&s;o much as frequently at this time to occa&s;ion the above
named worthy dome&s;tics to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"they never &s;aw &s;uch de|lightful
people as the inhabitants of Dover."</Q> It has been
repeatedly a&s;&s;erted many years ago by the Writer, who
has often bathed in the &s;ea at Dover, that the inhabitants,
even the very lowe&s;t ranks, were certainly the mo&s;t cour|teous
people in Europe, and attributed it to their vicinity
to their once amiable, delightfully courteous neighbours
on the other &s;ide of the water. The &s;treets of Dover are
narrow, of cour&s;e the pavement cannot be wide; and &s;o
<HI>very</HI> attentive are they, that you never &s;ee an inferior
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="96">
take the wall of a &s;uperior, or a charity-&s;chool child of an
elder per&s;on. If, looking on the other &s;ide, a bricklayer's
labourer in a leathern apron &s;tumble on any lady or gentle|man,
he in&s;tantly &s;teps off the narrow pavement with, <Q REND="inline">"I
a&s;k your pardon, Sir, or Madam, for not &s;eeing you
were coming."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's father u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"They
remind me of the days of my youth, &s;pent in Ireland,
where the inferior people are mo&s;t remarkably re&s;pectful
to their &s;uperiors."</Q></P>
<P>It would be a vain effort to attempt doing ju&s;tice to Mr.
Berkeley's gratitude to the excellent Mr. Brydges, of
Wootton Court, and his accompli&s;hed lady; at Dover, at
the time Mr. Berkeley was there. He u&s;ed to exclaim,
<Q REND="inline">"How often have they driven over to Wootton Court, to
fetch me &s;ome fine fruit, as if I had been only brother
to both."</Q> Fruit fit to eat, indeed any fruit, cannot be
procured for any &s;um at Dover: and on fruit, &s;weetmeats,
and old hock, did Mr. Berkeley long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. After his ar|rival
at Cheltenham, how many fervent prayers did he pour
forth to the Almighty, to reward the throughly amiable
relations of his Mother, Sir John and Lady Gui&s;e; when a
&s;ervant arrived loaded with the fine fruits of Highnam Court,
as al&s;o the amiable highly re&s;pected old friend of his Mo|ther,
Mr. De la Bere, of Cheltenham, in who&s;e plea&s;ing
conver&s;ation Mr. Berkeley much delighted, during the few
weeks of his life after his arrival at Cheltenham; whither
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="97">
he went, in compliance with the wi&s;hes of his Mother, to
enjoy the advice of the celebrated Dr. Che&s;tern, of Glou|ce&s;ter.
But, alas! Mr. Berkeley fell a victim to duty! He
had for near two years before been under the hands of an hy|pocritical
IGNORAMUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Editor wi&s;hes for the pen of a John&s;on, or a Burke, to endeavour to do ju&s;tice to her gratitude to that mo&s;t amiable of men, her re&s;pected friend, William Sharp, E&s;quire, of Fulham, who having, as it appeared, <HI>wrenched</HI> him&s;elf from his patients, from his exten&s;ive practice, has the goodne&s;s to at|tend to the maladies of his friends. Dr. Berkeley being from home for a few nights, Mrs. Berkeley in&s;tantly di&s;patched a letter to Mr. Sharp, conjuring him to permit her Son to wait on him, &s;he being convinced that he was in a very dangerous &s;ituation. The permi&s;&s;ion was, in the polite&s;t manner, more than granted. Mr. Sharp, mo&s;t amiably writing to Mrs. Berkeley, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will not give Mr. Berkeley the trouble of coming to Fulham; but, if he will be plea&s;ed to appoint any place, day, and hour, in town, I will punctually attend."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was too well bred, and felt this amiable goodne&s;s too &s;trongly, to accept it: he &s;et out for Fulham; and, on his arrival there, &s;ent his &s;ervant to beg to know at what hour it would be agreeable to Mr. Sharp to admit him. On pre&s;enting to Mr. Sharp a &s;hort letter of introduction from his Mother (Mr. Berkeley having never before &s;een him) good Mr. Sharp politely exclaimed, from Mrs. Berkeley's letter, <Q REND="inline">"Do all I can to re&s;cue you from the grave, Sir!

<P>Some years ago, the late amiable, pious Mrs. Wadham Knatchbull, having a di&s;order that baffled the &s;kill of &s;everal very good Canterbury &s;urgeons, her excel|lent &s;on, Wyndham Knatchbull, E&s;quire, prevailed on Mr. Sharp to vi&s;it her, after he had retired from practice. During his &s;tay at the hou&s;e of his excellent rela|tion, Dr. Dering, Prebendary of Canterbury, he very obligingly wrote a pre|&s;cription for a &s;nuff for Mrs. George Berkeley's eyes. To that gentleman's great &s;kill, when in practice fifteen years before, &s;he, under God, owes it, that, after having nur&s;ed a child too long, &s;he has &s;till, through mercy, one eye left, to &s;cribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors, her &s;ympa|thizing friends. Mrs. Berkeley, one morning, carried the pre&s;cription her&s;elf to Dr. Berkeley's re&s;pected &s;urgeon, Mr. Loftie, de&s;iring him to make it up him&s;elf, mentioning from whom &s;he had it, acknowledging, as above, that &s;he owed to that gentleman's &s;kill that &s;he had &s;till <HI>one</HI> eye. Mr. Loftie exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Then, Madam, <HI>you</HI> know Mr. Sharp."</Q> I never in my life beheld &s;uch another man.

<P>Mrs. Berkeley's fir&s;t care for her children was the &s;alva|tion

the Holy Spirit, delivered by St. Paul, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Bring up your chil|dren

<P>Mr. Berkeley was early a great &s;ceptic, which alarmed
his Mother the le&s;s, as &s;he felt it was hereditary; and &s;he
pur&s;ued the &s;ame plan which her eminently pious and wi&s;e
Mother had &s;o happily u&s;ed towards her&s;elf; and her en|deavours
to direct and &s;ettle that dangerous tendency of
mind were &s;o happily ble&s;&s;ed, that, from the early age of
fifteen, Mr. Berkeley was a mo&s;t zealous, ardent &s;tickler
for the co-equal co-eternal Godhead of his adored Redeemer,
and of the Holy Spirit, with the Father. A mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble
and worthy friend of his early youth, in a letter to
his Mother on the death of his beloved friend, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"How
often have I heard him in company <HI>battling</HI> for the <HI>ho|nour</HI>

<PB N="xcvi" REF="104">
laugh or &s;coff at this, although they know it to be true,
and that Mr. Berkeley did not wait to believe in the Saviour
of the world, until driven to him by &s;ickne&s;s or the ter|rors
of death.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, when her children were young, and
during their being under their Father's roof, whil&s;t at the
King's School at Canterbury, devoted her mornings prima|rily
to them, never admitting any morning vi&s;itor; which
occa&s;ioned the &s;en&s;ible, the witty Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, an old
intimate &s;chool friend of hers, frequently to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h
tho&s;e two na&s;ty little brats were dead out of the way;
then your friends might enjoy a little of your company."</Q>
The jocular wi&s;h, alas, is realized. That amiable friend
was very partial to them, perpetually fetching them to
children's card-parties at her ho&s;pitable man&s;ion. Mr.
Berkeley, when a man, u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I love
Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, for her goodne&s;s to me when I was a
boy."</Q> Her benevolence was &s;o well known, that all who
did not wi&s;h to drown puppies and kittens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As dogs and cats produce their young &s;o frequently and &s;o plentifully, is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the bounteous Giver of every good gift, meant the&s;e cheaply fed, dome&s;tic animals, for food for man, and not to be &s;ou&s;ed at nine days old into a hor&s;e-pond, to corrupt the water for the poor hor&s;es and cows? We learn, from high authority, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That God made nothing in vain.</HI>"</Q> The&s;e poor animals, as we treat them, &s;eem made <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than in vain. We read in Mr. For&s;ter's account of Captain Cook's fir&s;t voyage, that the life of that very worthy amiable man was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;aved by Mr. For&s;ter's &s;acrificing his favourite dog, for his food, when very ill; and it is well known that half London, who choo&s;e to eat <HI>tame</HI> rabbits, certainly eat cats. It is a pre|judice which, perhaps, like <HI>mo&s;t</HI> other prejudices, it would be wi&s;dom to give up. The county of Fife, in &s;ome parts, abounds with the fine&s;t rabbits, yet the poore&s;t labourer will not eat one, although &s;tarving; calling them <HI>carrion:</HI> they kill them, &s;ell their &s;kins, and throw the body to the <HI>&s;middie,</HI> (their elegant word for our gro&s;s one of <HI>dunghill;</HI>) <HI>we</HI> are rather a coar&s;e people; the French call that nece&s;&s;ary heap <HI>un fum&eacute;e.</HI> Many of the lower people of Scotland will not touch a &s;ilver eel, terming water-&s;nakes. When the late Bi&s;hop Berkeley went, in the year 1735, to re&s;ide in the palace at Cloyne, none of the poor Iri&s;h would eat of &s;ome very fine fi&s;h, in great plenty there, I think, the Jean d'or&eacute;e; but, after &s;ome time, they &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that if my Lord ate it, it could not <HI>harm</HI> them."</Q></NOTE> u&s;ed in the

needs no eulogium from the pen of an old friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, determined to attempt complying with the
earne&s;t reque&s;t of his Mother, took an affectionate, a grate|ful,
<HI>la&s;t</HI> farewell of all his amiable friends and obliging
neighbours at Dover, including the throughly re&s;pectable

was nece&s;&s;ary. The very worthy Mrs. Lane was then
mi&s;tre&s;s, with a hand&s;ome &s;alary. She lived many years
in the family of the late Lord Aylesford. Servants, who
have lived in genteel families, are the <HI>only proper</HI> conductors

<P>The aid of the very learned, very &s;kilful Dr. Packe had

him by her, had de&s;ired him to vi&s;it Mr. Berkeley at Do|ver,
which he did, and &s;aw him again at Canterbury on
his journey. It was &s;uppo&s;ed by all who did &s;ee him, that
Mr. Berkeley would hardly reach Sittingbourn alive; and
he was &s;uppo&s;ed once to be dead; yet it plea&s;ed that all|gracious
God, who&s;e mercies are no fewer than infinite, to
his faithful, however unworthy, &s;ervants, to conduct Mr.
Berkeley to Cheltenham, where his family had been for
&s;ome months, unable to get to him, on account of his Fa|ther's
lamentable &s;tate of health, as above mentioned. Mr.

Mrs. Simp&s;on, at the Ro&s;e at Sittingbourn&mdash;indeed they

Mr. Berkeley, by &s;low journeys, reached the metropolis,
where he re&s;ted two or three days, and collected all tho&s;e
few friends who happened to be in town at that &s;ea&s;on

He afterwards proceeded to his Father's hou&s;e at
Cookham; in the garden of which he ever delighted &s;o

Thames, as often to &s;ay to his Mother, who admired it at

him to meet Mr. Berkeley at Cookham, and endeavour to
admini&s;ter &s;omething to alleviate his &s;ufferings, during his
journey at lea&s;t. After a &s;hort re&s;t at Cookham, he left
his beloved relation, Mrs. Frin&s;ham, &s;o exhau&s;ted with

<P>By <HI>your own</HI> books, Mr. Berkeley meant either Romaine or

is lo&s;t for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My dear child, Sir Richard Hill is no more

<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pray proceed."</Q></P>
<P>On the Monday he reque&s;ted Mrs. Berkeley to read out

<P>About ten days before his lamented death, his Mother,
&s;itting in her u&s;ual place, clo&s;e to his pillow, he thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed
her: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I have a favour to beg of
you. Pray, promi&s;e me that you will grant it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My

unin&s;pired; and God knows, they lamentably want it in
that poor country, as well as in this."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley en|quired
to whom he wi&s;hed her to &s;end it. He mentioned
a particular old friend of his Father, for whom Mr. Berkeley
had a very great and unfeigned regard. Mrs. Berkeley pro|mi&s;ed
him, that, if it plea&s;ed God to &s;pare her life, &s;he cer|tainly
would &s;end it without fail.</P>
<P>The evening immediately preceding Mr. Berkeley's happy
departure, as Mrs. Berkeley was &s;itting by his bed &s;ide,
he fell into a &s;weet &s;leep. A &s;ervant came to announce
to her, that tea was made. She went &s;ilently out of the
room. In a few minutes he awoke, and enquired of his
&s;ervant, <Q REND="inline">"Where is my Mother?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;t gone down to
tea, Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Go down, and give my duty to her, and
&s;ay, that when &s;he has <HI>quite</HI> done drinking her tea, I beg

&s;ummons; he kindly reproached her for having come &s;o
quickly, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He feared &s;he had not taken her tea
(which he knew was her favourite refre&s;hment) in com|fort."</Q>
On being a&s;&s;ured that &s;he had done, he began,
<Q REND="inline">"My deare&s;t Mother, I beg that you will have the good|ne&s;s

<P>Mr. Berkeley might mo&s;t <HI>happily</HI> term it &s;uch; for it was
that <HI>alone,</HI> by the mercy of God, that <HI>could,</HI> that <HI>did,</HI> ena|ble
him to triumph over the KING of TERRORS.</P>
<P>Mrs. Frin&s;ham u&s;ed frequently, when vi&s;iting at Dr.
Berkeley's, to &s;ay to her &s;i&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;urprized your chil|dren

bed &s;upperle&s;s;) in &s;o very good humoured a voice, that
I wonder they ever believe you."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed to
a&s;&s;ure her, that there was no need of uttering the promi&s;e
in the tone of a fi&s;h-woman, as they <HI>well</HI> knew, whatever
the <HI>voice</HI> was, the <HI>threat</HI> would <HI>infallibly</HI> be executed.</P>
<P><PB N="cxix" REF="127">
A curious little anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's early entering
into characters occurred when he was ju&s;t turned &s;ix years
old. One day Mrs. Frin&s;ham and Dr. Berkeley, going
down the Southcote Walk, he gallopped by them, whip|ping
his hor&s;e (a fine long &s;tick), &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Frin&s;ham,
I am to dine upon bread and water to-day."</Q> His two
relatives, both made up of tenderne&s;s, lamentably exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! I hope not: go, and beg pardon."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Oh! that
won't do."</Q> To which his Father replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my
dear, go, and try to coax your Mamma."</Q> With a look
of ineffable &s;corn, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Sir, <HI>you</HI> don't
know MY Mamma. When <HI>once</HI> &s;he has &s;aid (imitating
the exact tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Always as &s;low as a &s;entence could be uttered, and with all the &s;olemnity of an excellent judge on the bench.</NOTE> in which the threat was denounced)
<HI>Berkeley! you &s;hall dine to day upon bread and water,</HI>
if the KING was to come, and go down upon <HI>both</HI> his
knees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Doctor and Mrs. Berkeley being very old-fa&s;hioned per&s;ons in &s;ome things; their children con&s;tantly a&s;king their parents ble&s;&s;ing every morning and night, were never &s;uffered to kneel on both knees, Mrs. Berkeley's father never &s;uffering her to do it, always &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Never fall on both your knees, but to your Father in Heaven. He is King of kings,&mdash;Lord of lords. You cannot humble your&s;elves enough to him."</Q> A&s;king a parent's ble&s;&s;ing is now quite ob&s;olete. The Editor has very frequently &s;een her old hereditary friend, the agreeable learned Author of "CHRISTIANITY NOT FOUNDED ON ARGUMENT," (alas! for him, poor man!) on his arrival from his own &s;eat in Surrey, at his pious mother's hou&s;e in Berks, con&s;tantly drop on his knee, previou&s;ly to his taking notice of any one, before his mother's chair, (&s;he was lame,) &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I beg your ble&s;&s;ing."</Q>&mdash;This, it mu&s;t be known, was out of re&s;pect to her,&mdash;Mr. Berkeley that he might obtain a Parent's interce&s;&s;ion with GOD.</NOTE> to her, &s;he would not pardon me. My Mamma is
<PB N="cxx" REF="128">
not like you&mdash;when I am naughty, take and give me a
good hearty &s;hake or two, and &s;cold me for a minute or
two, and then forget it directly."</Q> The idea of his Ma|je&s;ty's
interce&s;&s;ion being vain, was a lucky one; or per|haps
as his Maje&s;ty, in hunting, frequently pa&s;&s;ed through
Dr. Berkeley's grounds, this extraordinary little genius
might have thrown him&s;elf in his way. He had been told
that nobody mu&s;t ever turn their backs on the King. When
about five years old, walking one evening with his Mother
and Mi&s;s Leigh, a relation of hers, in Ken&s;ington gardens,
he on a &s;udden began walking backwards, pre&s;ently &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"Dear ladies, why do you not walk backwards?"</Q> Some
gentleman pa&s;&s;ed, whom <HI>he</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be his Maje&s;ty,
whom he had then never &s;een. But to return.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt that he had broken God's Law, had fallen
into temptation, and con&s;idering that he had received a tho|roughly
pious education, as he u&s;ed to tell his con&s;oling Mo|ther,
when &s;he repeatedly applied to his broken contrite &s;pirit,
that glorious promi&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"Though your <HI>&s;ins</HI> be as <HI>&s;carlet,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c.
and that infinitely gracious one of our eternal co-equal Sa|viour

laden, and I will refre&s;h you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my dear Mo|ther,
I have been a more grievous &s;inner than others,
becau&s;e I have had a more pious education than mo&s;t
per&s;ons."</Q> But, ble&s;&s;ed, for ever ble&s;&s;ed, be the a&s;toni&s;h|ing
Love of God the COMFORTER, this ble&s;&s;ed little book
poured the balm of perfect peace, of joy, into his lovely
wounded &s;pirit; and he wi&s;hed others to be con&s;oled by it.</P>
<P>One morning, after all fear of vengeance on account of
the broken Law of God was quite done away, by HIS
mercy, <Q REND="inline">"who is MIGHTY to &s;ave,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"who trod the
wine-pre&s;s ALONE,"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, going into the room,
as was her cu&s;tom, enquired if he had pa&s;&s;ed a tolerable
night. His reply was, <Q REND="inline">"I have had great pain, and have
not clo&s;ed my eyes one minute &s;ince I &s;aw you; but I
have been in heaven, ble&s;&s;ed be the MERCY of GOD."</Q>
A few mornings afterwards the &s;ame anxious enquiry was
an&s;wered in the very &s;ame words, with this addition,
<Q REND="inline">"Surely, my deare&s;t Mother, it is not an illu&s;ion of my
GRAND ENEMY, to lull me into &s;ecurity."</Q> So watchful
was he again&s;t deceiving him&s;elf, e&s;pecially in the concerns
of his &s;oul; to which his Mother earne&s;tly replied, <Q REND="inline">"No,
my dear child, NO. That God whom you have laboured
&s;o zealou&s;ly, &s;o faithfully, to &s;erve, although he has per|mitted
you to <HI>fall,</HI> to &s;hew you your own frailty, yet he will
never &s;uffer the Enemy of Souls to delude you. Be&s;ides,
my deare&s;t creature what <HI>can</HI> the Devil hope to gain by you,

in your pre&s;ent helple&s;s, langui&s;hing &s;tate, unle&s;s he could
tempt you to bla&s;pheme, or de&s;pair, as you lie &s;tretched

of God, he has never yet been able to do either the one
or the other. No, my dear Son, God has vouch&s;afed,
in infinite mercy, to lift up the light of his reconciled
countenance upon you, to an&s;wer the con&s;tant fervent
prayers of your poor unworthy Mother, and your own,
on <HI>this</HI> &s;ide the grave."</Q> At two, three, or four nights
di&s;tance, Mr. Berkeley had two or three more &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed
nights; for which wonderfully gracious vouch&s;afement all
glory be to FREE SOVEREIGN GRACE and REDEEMING
LOVE.</P>
<P>The day before Mr. Berkeley's death, he di&s;covered, by
what Dr. Berkeley happened to drop, that Mrs. Berkeley had
&s;at up the whole of the preceding night in the next room.
His eyes fla&s;hed with indignation, and he in&s;tantly &s;poke to
her concerning it. As Mrs. Berkeley never, in the polite in|tercour&s;e
of life, &s;uffers her&s;elf to fal&s;ify<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A lady one day reque&s;ted Mrs. Berkeley to make a very fine <HI>made-up</HI> &s;peech of excu&s;e for her to &s;ome other lady; to which Mrs. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Would it not, Madam, be better to tell the truth, and &s;ay, that really a multiplicity of engagements have rendered it inconvenient for you to go &s;o far?"</Q> Mr. Monck Berkeley, happening to be pre&s;ent, remarked, <Q REND="inline">"How little that good lady knows MY Mother! why She will not tell a <HI>civil</HI> lye for my Father, or my&s;elf. Her idea is, that many <HI>obliging, polite, kind, friendly</HI> things may be &s;aid, without &s;acrificing TRUTH."</Q> The worthy amiable Mrs. Waller, &s;i&s;ter of the Archdeacon of E&s;&s;ex, the friend of Mrs. Berkeley from eight years old, always &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"There is a real plea&s;ure in hearing a polite thing from Mrs Berkeley, "for you may <HI>&s;wear</HI> it comes from her heart."</Q></NOTE>, &s;he was obliged at

la&s;t to confe&s;s, that &s;he had repo&s;ed on the &s;opha in the

&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, <HI>why</HI> would you <HI>&s;uffer</HI> it?"</Q> Dr.
Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child, your Mother would have
been wretched if I had interpo&s;ed."</Q> He then extorted a
&s;olemn promi&s;e from his Mother, that &s;he would go to re&s;t
that night, amiably adding, <Q REND="inline">"and promi&s;e that you will un|dre&s;s,
and go into bed, or I will not attempt to clo&s;e my
eyes all night."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley retired, with a &s;trict in|junction
to Dr. Berkeley's and Mr. Berkeley's own &s;ervant,
both of whom attended him with wonderful a&s;&s;iduity, al|ternately
lying in a tent-bed in Mr. Berkeley's room, and
&s;itting up with him, that &s;he would never forgive them, if
they perceived the lea&s;t change in Mr. Berkeley, and did
not in&s;tantly call her up.</P>
<P>On the morning of January 26, Mr. Berkeley's &s;ervant
knocked at the chamber-door, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that he came with
his Ma&s;ter's duty, and de&s;ired Dr. Berkeley would go
down, and pray with him."</Q> Dr. Berkeley in&s;tantly aro&s;e,
and went down. Ju&s;t as Mrs. Berkeley had put on &s;ome
<PB N="cxxiv" REF="132">
of her cloaths, Dr. Berkeley, returned, announcing <Q REND="inline">"the
heavy tidings,"</Q> that they had lo&s;t their <HI>earthly</HI> trea&s;ure.
Mrs. Berkeley, although having ever earne&s;tly wi&s;hed and
prayed to witne&s;s the la&s;t moments of all tho&s;e beloved re|lations
&s;he is doomed to &s;urvive, &s;ubmitted, in &s;he humbly

I heard Berkeley cough in my life, he has coughed this

him any more on earth."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's maid entered
at that in&s;tant, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was come to
life again, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee Mrs. Berkeley."</Q> It may be
ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he was not long in getting down &s;tairs,
where &s;he &s;aw her dear Son looking like an angel, his fine
eyes as lively as when in perfect health; and for about a
fortnight before his death, his no&s;e became &s;o exactly like
the beautiful one of his two grandfathers, Bi&s;hop Berkeley
and Mr. Frin&s;ham, both having the &s;ame fine-&s;haped no&s;e,
that he looked remarkably beautiful. The &s;ame change
after death took place, in the &s;ame feature of Dr. Berkeley's
wonderfully beautiful face. Such changes are &s;aid, by
the learned men of the faculty, often to happen a few
<PB N="cxxv" REF="133">
hours before the &s;eparation of the &s;pirit from the earthly
mould.</P>
<P>Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley both wanted what Mrs.
Berkeley always termed the genuine Berkeley no&s;e, and
which her own father, without being a Berkeley, had. The
pre&s;ent Counte&s;s Dowager of Granard has it. When the
beautiful lady Georgiana Berkeley, &s;he was a fac &s;imile of a
wonderfully fine ivory medallion taken of Bi&s;hop Berkeley,
at Rome, when a young man. Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay,

Mr. Monck Berkeley had, from pictures in Berke|ley
Ca&s;tle, and from monuments, drawings of all his noble
ance&s;tors, and u&s;ed to &s;how his Mother &s;ome few with a

all well married, and make as excellent wives as their beau|tiful
mother. The worthy veteran u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I never

Mr. Berkeley, who always greatly delighted in the P&s;alms,

Mr. Berkeley felt the whole well &s;uited to his &s;tate, parti|cularly

of England, in her office for the Vi&s;itation of the Sick. He
appeared &s;o much revived, that his friends all quitted the
room a little before noon, except his Mother, the medical
gentlemen who attended having given it as their opinion
that he would remain until about ten at night. In about
half an hour, his Mother, perceiving that &s;peaking &s;eemed
rather painful to him, and that he breathed rather quicker,

by her Son's pillow; he fixed his &s;till fine eyes mo&s;t
tenderly upon her for about two minutes, then clo&s;ed them,
&s;he conceiving that he was re&s;olved his poor unworthy
Mother &s;hould be the la&s;t earthly object they &s;hould be|hold.
He then, without calling for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
&s;ervant, turned him&s;elf quite round to the other &s;ide of
his bed, laid his arms down by his &s;ide, and made him&s;elf
quite ready for his coffin; then uttered three di&s;tinct a&s;|pirations,
as was conceived, to that co-equal Triune God,
in whom he had ever &s;o firmly believed from the age of
fifteen. After a little time, one &s;ingle deep breath to <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
as was &s;uppo&s;ed, his lovely &s;pirit winged its happy flight to
the realms of bli&s;s. There may all who loved him, in

the Throne, and &s;inging, "Worthy is the Lamb," &amp;c.
Thus ended the &s;hort&mdash;long&mdash;life of George Monck Berke|ley,
E&s;quire; leaving his parents to&mdash;what &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;deplore
their irreparable lo&s;s. They could hardly be &s;o
&s;elfi&s;h; and as Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, a near relation of his Father,
and Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, an old intimate friend, both with
one con&s;ent, although in very di&s;tant parts, &s;aid, in their

one mu&s;t rather exult with you on &s;o happy, &s;o delight|ful

Son and Hu&s;band, &s;he would not be &s;elfi&s;h enough&mdash;wicked
enough&mdash;to form that wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley prayed fervently to God for three things;
and He that heareth the prayers of the contrite, heard and
an&s;wered him:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the agonies of his &s;tomach might cea&s;e one
week before he quitted this mortal life. <Q REND="inline">"Oh! &s;pare me
a little, that I may recover my &s;trength before I go hence,
and be no more &s;een."</Q>&mdash;The mercy of God graciou&s;ly
ordered, that they cea&s;ed ju&s;t ten days before his death;
<PB N="cxxix" REF="137">
and, in&s;tead of that craving for fruits and acids, he rather
wi&s;hed to avoid taking any thing, not even orange and le|mon
jelly; &s;o as to occa&s;ion his Mother's one day &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Man, if you do not take a little nouri&s;hment,
you will be a &s;uicide;"</Q> to which he ha&s;tily replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!
God, for Je&s;us' &s;ake, avert."</Q> He then took the gla&s;s of
jelly from her hand, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will take any thing you
wi&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>Going into his room one morning, he, as u&s;ual, en|quired
kindly of Mrs. Berkeley concerning her health, to
which &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"As well, my dear, as I can expect to
be, with this horrid weather."</Q> Fro&s;t has ever been ex|ceedingly
inimical to Mrs. Berkeley's health. He, with
the milde&s;t, &s;weete&s;t voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, is it
<HI>quite</HI> right in us to find fault with any weather, or any
thing that God plea&s;es to &s;end us?"</Q> A few years ago,
an Iri&s;h gentleman of fortune, of Cork, publi&s;hed a long

may, perhaps, be wrong; but one has, from childhood,
been accu&s;tomed to &s;ay, unreproved, <Q REND="inline">"What horrid, or

<P>Secondly, That he might not die in the night, or in his
&s;leep.&mdash;He expired exactly at noon, the &s;un &s;hining more
remarkably bright and clear than is at all u&s;ual at that &s;ea|&s;on
of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="cxxx" REF="138">
Thirdly, That he might retain his &s;en&s;es perfectly to the
very la&s;t breath he drew. How graciou&s;ly that petition
was an&s;wered has been above related.</P>

<P>Mr. Berkeley was too well known in the metropoli&s;es of
the&s;e three kingdoms to make a particular de&s;cription of
his per&s;on nece&s;&s;ary. Suffice it therefore to &s;ay, that the
beauty of his face by no means equalled that of his exqui|&s;itely
beautiful Father, and his &s;till hand&s;omer Grandfather,
Bi&s;hop Berkeley. He more re&s;embled, in face and &s;tature,
his Mother's Father, the thoroughly excellent Reverend
Henry Frin&s;ham, A.M. e&s;teemed when at Oxford, and
till debilitated by illne&s;s, the &s;tronge&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"be&s;t-built"</Q> man in
England. Mr. Frin&s;ham and his grand&s;on were both &s;ix
feet high without their &s;hoes: each took care not be in|debted
to them for additional height; both their &s;trength
was mu&s;cular, both having remarkably &s;mall bones. Mr.
Berkeley was much hand&s;omer than Mr. Frin&s;ham, except|ing
his no&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Frin&s;ham going once to dine with a friend at a gentleman's hou&s;e, one &s;ervant was ob&s;erved not to move when any thing was called for.

Mr. Berkeley could not look into a gla&s;s without perceiving that he did not re&s;emble his Father. His agreeable wit u&s;ed to divert his friends, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Some poor &s;imple per&s;on, now and then, meaning to flatter <HI>my</HI> Mother, &s;ays, 'Dear Ma|dam, how much Mr. Berkeley re&s;embles the Doctor;' I, who know <HI>le de&s;ous des cartes,</HI> &s;ee my Mother redden, and an&s;wer, 'Oh! dear Sir, or Madam, <HI>not</HI> the <HI>lea&s;t in the world</HI>'&mdash;Sometimes a &s;impler &s;oul &s;ays, Madam, I think Mr. Berkeley is very like you.&mdash;The fir&s;t was bad enough, but now I can fancy I &s;ee my Mother getting her knuckles ready to knock them down."</Q>&mdash;Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed often to laugh, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, how is it that, with very fine eyes, &amp;c. an exqui&s;itely fine complexion, the fine&s;t teeth ever &s;et in a head, and very fine hair, and a well-&s;haped face, <HI>you are not</HI> hand&s;ome."</Q> A mo&s;t highly accompli&s;hed, &s;en&s;ible, intimate friend of Mr. Berkeley's Mother, the lady of D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, E&s;quire, u&s;ed often to &s;ay to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"If you tell him before me that he is not hand&s;ome, <HI>I will knock you down.</HI>&mdash;All the ladies and men &s;ay he is hand&s;ome.&mdash;Don't mind, Berkeley, what your Mother &s;ays, becau&s;e you don't happen to be ju&s;t like your Father."</Q></NOTE>, the great beauty of his face; his eyes much

With Mr. Berkeley it was attended with &s;ome little difficulty, from the extreme volatility of his motions. Dr. Berkeley and all her intimate friends thought her the mo&s;t daring of &s;pirits to venture to do it before Mr. Berkeley could li&s;ten to rea&s;on. It was then done when he was in a &s;ound &s;leep.

Dr. Berkeley's family once attending &s;ome friends of
theirs of too high rank to be left entirely to the verger of
the week to view the curio&s;ities of the magnificent cathe|dral
of Canterbury; on reaching the tomb of the Black
Prince, the &s;word was taken out as u&s;ual, and delivered to
the company to admire. When going to be again depo&s;ited
within the iron railing, Mr. Berkeley took it into his hands,
and drew it with as much ea&s;e as he would have drawn his
own &s;word. Mrs. Pre&s;ton, the verger's wife, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Good Lord! Sir, what have you done?"</Q> Mr. Berkeley's
Mother in&s;tantly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I hope no harm. My dear Berke|ley,
why would you draw it without a&s;king if it was per|mitted
to be drawn?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Harm, Madam,"</Q> replied the

has not hurt him&s;elf;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir; I &s;uppo&s;e I
have &s;een more than an hundred gentlemen attempt to
draw that &s;word, but no one ever accompli&s;hed it with
one hand but your&s;elf."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's alarm then &s;ub|&s;ided,
and &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"He has his Mother's and Grand-father's
wonderful &s;trength of wri&s;t."</Q> So entirely mu&s;cular
was his &s;trength, that, a &s;hort time before his death, that
wri&s;t that could lift a man nearly as tall as him&s;elf by the
<PB N="cxxxiii" REF="141">
collar of the coat, did not mea&s;ure half an inch more than
his Mother's, who is a very little woman.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley's per&s;on altogether made what per|&s;ons
u&s;ually term a very fine looking young man. He was
&s;o exactly proportioned, that he never appeared a tall man,
except when &s;tanding in a groupe. He had a mo&s;t graceful
figure, and was e&s;teemed the fine&s;t dancer of his &s;tature
in England. At the famous ma&s;querade given by the late
Lord Barrymore at Wargrove, where Mr. Berkeley ap|peared
as an Highland Chief, mo&s;t completely elegantly
equipped; pur&s;e, claymore, dirk, &amp;c. every thing but the
kelt, in&s;ted of which he wore the trow&s;e; two ma&s;ks ac|co&s;ted
him with, <Q REND="inline">"Laird, are you for a Highland reel?"</Q>
Mr. Berkeley in&s;tantly gave his claymore to a gentleman to
hold, &s;tepped forward, and they began a <HI>three&s;ome reel,</HI> in
which the &s;uperiority of Mr. Berkeley's dancing was &s;o
marked, as to cau&s;e a very great per&s;onage, who honoured
that mo&s;t elegant ma&s;querade with his pre&s;ence, to &s;tand the
whole time, and to &s;ay, at the expiration of that beautiful
dance, when well danced by <HI>Scots,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was
the fine&s;t figure, and the fine&s;t dancer he had ever &s;een;"</Q>
and prai&s;e from tho&s;e who excel in any art, is <HI>prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, although not regularly hand&s;ome, had
perhaps one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing countenances any where
to be &s;een&mdash;a look of the deepe&s;t thought, enlightened by
<PB N="cxxxiv" REF="142">
the &s;weete&s;t, milde&s;t benevolence, and, when called forth,
brightened by the livelie&s;t cha&s;tized gaiety; which has
cau&s;ed &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters for learning and &s;en&s;e
to a&s;&s;ert, that Mr. Monck Berkeley was the mo&s;t agreeable
companion they had ever known. That look of deep
thought, and exqui&s;ite benevolence, &s;eldom united in the
&s;ame &s;oul, &s;eldomer blended in the &s;ame countenance, are
&s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly pre&s;erved in the beautiful portrait painted
by his beloved friend, Mr. Peters, and by that throughly
amiable gentleman pre&s;ented to Mrs. Berkeley after her
Son's death, as to delight all who have a &s;oul capable of en|joying
the beauties of an exqui&s;ite painting. The print
prefixed to the Poems is taken from that exqui&s;ite painting;
but Engraving cannot give the &s;oul like Painting. Mrs.
Berkeley e&s;teems her&s;elf rich in a mo&s;t beautiful miniature
of her un&s;peakably dear Son, &s;o &s;mall as con&s;tantly to be
carried in the pocket, taken from Mr. Peters's portrait, by
the wonderful, the magic pencil of her excellent accom|pli&s;hed
friend, Mi&s;s John&s;on, of the Paddock-Hou&s;e near
Canterbury. Whoever has an eye for fine painting, and
has been treated with a fight of that Lady's performances,
mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing one of a dear
departed friend. It can hardly be &s;aid departed. He is
pre&s;ent, and does every thing but articulate. Such obli|gations
are not to be repaid. The mines of Brazil, if po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
are not adequate. Mrs. Berkeley was &s;ome years
ago indebted to the &s;ame exqui&s;ite pencil for a bracelet
<PB N="cxxxv" REF="143">
of her younge&s;t Son, done entirely from memory; for two
indifferent pictures of that beautiful child rather confu&s;ed
than a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>At the King's School at Canterbury a common amu&s;e|ment
of the lower &s;chool was playing at <HI>judge and jury.</HI>
Coun&s;el were regularly retained to plead on each &s;ide. By
accident Dr. Berkeley di&s;covered the value that was &s;et on
his Son's oratorical powers in that mimic court, on fir&s;t hear|ing
of it from the amiable beloved friend of his Son, the
late Mr. Thurlow, &s;on of Lord Thurlow, who&s;e play hours
were con&s;tantly &s;pent under the ho&s;pitable roof of Dr.
Berkeley, who enquiring how the coun&s;el were feed, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! we have all the &s;ame fee, a halfpenny apiece,
excepting Berkeley, and he has always a penny."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"A
penny! (replied Dr. Berkeley,) why &s;hould he have a
penny? I am &s;ure, he is not covetous."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no; but

<P>Soon after his going to the King's School at Canterbury,
there came to board, at Dr. Beauvoir's, Mr. Thurlow, only
&s;on of the late Lord Chancellor Thurlow, by Mi&s;s Lynch,
<PB N="cxl" REF="148">
daughter of the charitable, ho&s;pitable Dean Lynch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean Lynch pre&s;erved the poor of Canterbury from &s;tarving, as they have &s;ince done, by ordering five hundred pounds worth of &s;ilk dama&s;k to be wove, and entirely new furni&s;hed the Deanery.

Reverend Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury. Each of
the&s;e gentlemen inherited a very large &s;hare of both their
parents' extraordinarily charitable di&s;po&s;ition, as did the
late lovely Mrs. Hey and Mrs. Tatton, their &s;i&s;ters. Mr.
Thurlow then about eight years old, ju&s;t half a year younger
than Mr. Berkeley, was &s;ent from under the protection of
his &s;en&s;ible, wonderfully kind <HI>adopting</HI> father, the Reverend
Mr. Hey of Wickham, who&s;e lady, above-named, was his
Mother's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. The Writer cannot proceed without
heaving a &s;igh, and dropping a tear of friend&s;hip over the
urn of that mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, intere&s;ting of youths, the only &s;on
of dear Thurlow's <HI>earthly guardian angel,</HI> Mr. Hey. She
&s;till feels plea&s;ure in recollecting how often he u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline">"Is it not very odd, that, although I have uncles, aunts,
and many kind relations, who are very good to me; yet
I always feel my&s;elf more at home at Dr. Berkeley's?"</Q>
He was about fifteen; a youth of a very &s;ingular turn of
mind, endowed with all his father's great under&s;tanding,
<PB N="cxli" REF="149">
and all the real, mild, not affected, gentlene&s;s of his lovely
mother. A &s;trong tincture of melancholy was vi&s;ible to
even a common ob&s;erver. As a child at home, it was &s;aid
he never loved to play; at &s;chool he never played at cric|ket,
&amp;c. longer than ten minutes, then retired to read.
Mrs. Berkeley's wi&s;h to delight the mother of an only child
occa&s;ioned her telling her &s;ervants, <Q REND="inline">"that whenever Mrs.
Hey's carriage came to Dr. Berkeley's, &s;ome &s;ervant man,
or woman, mu&s;t go immediately to Dr. Beauvoir's, where
he boarded, to fetch Ma&s;ter Hey."</Q> Both mother and
&s;on felt more than this little <HI>motherly</HI> attention merited.
Mrs. Berkeley told Ma&s;ter Hey, when he felt him&s;elf low|&s;pirited,
and had no more agreeable place to take his tea,
he would find it in her dre&s;&s;ing-room at &s;ix, where he
would, &s;ometimes, enjoy the very improving conver&s;ation
of that accompli&s;hed, that wi&s;e director of young men, Dr.
Berkeley; if not, he might di&s;&s;ipate his gloom a little, by
hearing her <HI>raileries</HI> on his gravity, &amp;c. at fifteen, Mrs.
Berkeley, having been in the &s;ame predicament her&s;elf, at
twelve, with a youth of thirteen. Dear Johnny, as he was
always called by Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley, had contrived very
early in life, before he was thirteen, to form an attach|ment,
that did not contribute to di&s;&s;ipate the natural gloom
of his mind, although it often exhilarated him.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t daughter of the celebrated Mr. Air&s;on,
although very far from hand&s;ome, was ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o very
<PB N="cxlii" REF="150">
fine an under&s;tanding, that all the uncommonly &s;en&s;ible
youths, and even lads, were her devoted admirers, as others
were of the great beauty of Dr. Beauvoir's elde&s;t daughter,
now married to William Hammond, E&s;quire, of the Friers,
Canterbury. Mi&s;s Air&s;on died at the age of nineteen.
Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay of her, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he had under|&s;tanding
enough to &s;et up a large country town."</Q> Her
gratitude was great indeed, (that VERY &s;carce virtue, grow|ing
only in an <HI>humble</HI> heart, and cheri&s;hed by a &s;trong
head;) for what <HI>&s;he</HI> deemed the conde&s;cending attentions
of Mrs. Berkeley to her, her father being a <HI>Minor</HI> where
Mrs. Berkeley's hu&s;band was a <HI>Major.</HI> Although very
kindly treated at Canterbury to what they are in mo&s;t other
Cathedrals and Choirs, Norwich excepted; the Minor|canons
and Schoolma&s;ters, their wives and daughters, are
in a very different line of company. In general, their ori|ginal
fortunes, and always their church incomes, are
undoubtedly &s;o much inferior, as not to make them <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to
mix. Mrs. Berkeley, on being once reproached by a Pre|bendary's
lady, for introducing Mi&s;s Air&s;ons at her routs,
and being intimate with their elegant, &s;weet mother,
made this laconic reply: <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Madam, Mrs.
Air&s;on's father had almo&s;t as many thou&s;ands a year as
<HI>my</HI> father had hundreds; and if Mrs. Air&s;on cho&s;e to
marry the fir&s;t &s;inger in the world, a clergyman and a
<HI>gentleman,</HI> rather than a fooli&s;h ignoramus in a red coat,
does that make her conver&s;ation the le&s;s plea&s;ing to me?
<PB N="cxliii" REF="151">
Should Mrs. Air&s;on's elegant accompli&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Burton, E&s;quire, of Shrop&s;hire.</NOTE> nephew, with

thank God, &s;o am not courting Mrs. Air&s;on for her ne|phew."</Q>
Mr. Air&s;on and his family were &s;o highly, &s;o
univer&s;ally re&s;pected, that their &s;mall hou&s;e was the re&s;ort
of all per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and good &s;en&s;e. The late amiable
Bi&s;hop of Norwich, when Dean of Canterbury, would
often, when walking out, &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Come, my dear Madam,
&s;uppo&s;e we go to Johnny's coffee-hou&s;e."</Q> Mr. Air&s;on,
a great invalid, never dined, or even drank tea from home.
He never confined his lady or daughters; they well knew
<HI>he</HI> would not pa&s;s his afternoons alone. His piety almo&s;t
equalled his mu&s;ical powers; which he never would u&s;e,
(except in a private room to his friends,) but in the hou&s;e
of that God who be&s;towed them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It u&s;ed &s;ometimes to be &s;aid that Mr. Air&s;on was indolent, and did not &s;ing a fine anthem. When a&s;ked if he <HI>thought</HI> him&s;elf ill, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"A&s;k Mrs. Berkley, if I ever in my life, when able to go to church, refu&s;ed &s;inging any anthem when &s;he de&s;ired it of me."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley her&s;elf had an idea of not riding a free hor&s;e to death.</NOTE>. Handel offered him
eight hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> if he would only &s;ing in

remarkable that the Sunday after his very &s;udden death,
the late Bi&s;hop of Norwich, then Dean of Canterbury, la|mented
his lo&s;s, and celebrated his virtues, in &s;imilar words
<PB N="cxliv" REF="152">
to tho&s;e u&s;ed by the Writer of this Preface in the Canter|bury
Paper the preceding day, when lamenting the lo&s;s of
that cheerful, gay, heavenly-minded friend, whom &s;he
had &s;o far, <HI>en gaiet&eacute; de coeur,</HI> prevailed on, to accompany her
as far as his hall, in her way to a rout at his next door
neighbour's, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"She &s;hould attract <HI>all</HI> eyes, and re|ceive

to his having on his <HI>old</HI> coat, and begging him to

objected, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"It might, tender as he was, occa&s;ion
his taking cold."</Q> Had he gone, &s;he would ever have
reproached her&s;elf, as the cau&s;e of his univer&s;ally lamented
death.</P>
<P>It is now more than high time to return from this too
long digre&s;&s;ion; but the reciting the virtues of beloved, re|&s;pected
friends, NOW beyond the reach of any other atten|tions,
is apt, in a heart &s;u&s;ceptible of <HI>&s;incere</HI> regard for
real worth, to give the pen a di&s;order, which the French
apply to the tongue of one who talks too much, <HI>il a une
fluxe de langue.</HI> The Writer often feels <HI>la fluxe de plume.</HI>
She is &s;ometimes tempted to form the wi&s;h of an old friend
of hers, who&s;e hu&s;band made her, &s;he being a ready pen|woman,
write much for him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Well; I do wi&s;h I had never
been taught to write at all.</HI>"</Q> Perhaps the readers of this
<PB N="cxlv" REF="153">
may form it for her; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to read the
whole of every book; and, to u&s;e the language of Holy
Writ, they may <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;eparate the precious from the vile.</HI>"</Q> They
may read the fine Poetry of the Author, and pa&s;s over the
indifferent Pro&s;e of the Editor.</P>
<P>Whenever Mr. Monck Berkeley ob&s;erved any boy, who
boarded at either of the Ma&s;ters, never invited out to
dinner on holidays, he would &s;ay to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"Pray,
my dear Madam, next holiday invite poor &s;uch an one,
and &s;uch an one. Poor things, they have no relations or
acquaintance here to invite them; and it is very dull for
them. Pray be &s;o good as to let them come here."</Q> This
whether they were his intimates or not. Indeed his inti|mates
&s;eldom did come, having, mo&s;t of them, parents in
the church or city, excepting &s;ometimes the Reverend
Cooper Willyams, of Ixning, &s;on of the very worthy Cap|tain
and Mrs. Willyams, and Captain Gregory, of the
Wilt&s;hire Militia, &s;on of the very learned Reverend Francis
Gregory of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Mr. Thurlow happened to come to &s;chool in the begin|ning
of &s;ummer, when all his uncles and aunts, u&s;ually re|&s;ident
in Canterbury during the winter, had retired to
their country re&s;idences. Mr. Berkeley &s;oon pre&s;ented his
humble petition to his Mother, that he might bring Thur|low
<PB N="cxlvi" REF="154">
home &s;ometimes. The reque&s;t was granted; and the
good di&s;po&s;ition, the propriety, the docility, the worthine&s;s
of Mr. Thurlow, &s;oon endeared him &s;o much to Mrs.
Berkeley, that &s;he told her Son <Q REND="inline">"he might bring Thurlow,
but no other boy, without a&s;king her permi&s;&s;ion, when|ever
he plea&s;ed."</Q> The dear child generally drank tea
every evening in <HI>winter</HI> at Dr. Berkeley's, for in <HI>&s;ummer</HI>
they are all
<Q>"over the hills and far away."</Q>
When he was a little more than nine years old, he, like
his friend Mr. Berkeley, was &s;ent to France, for &s;everal
months, to acquire the French language in perfection. At
his return he gave a proof of the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of his
heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;hort character and &s;incere lamentation of this early (not untimely&mdash;for GOD's time is ever the be&s;t time) death of this beloved young gentleman was in|&s;erted by his friend Mrs. Berkeley. in Bri&s;tow's Canterbury Journal. It fell &s;hort in de&s;cribing his amiability: but the Editor cannot let a beloved friend, whether young or old, quit this mortal &s;cene, without paying that little tribute to their memory&mdash;when &s;he &s;ees it neglected by abler pens.</NOTE>. On his arrival in England, he went from Dover,
for a &s;hort time, to the hou&s;e of his kind patron Mr. Hey,
who &s;oon brought him to Canterbury for a day. The in|&s;tant
he got out of the carriage he flew to the Oaks,
knocked at the door, and begged he might be &s;hown up to
Mrs. Berkeley. Being told &s;he was in bed with a bad head|ach,
he expre&s;&s;ed much concern, and enquired what time &s;he
<PB N="cxlvii" REF="155">
would ri&s;e; the &s;ervant replied, <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t likely to dinner;"</Q>
as &s;he never continued in bed, when not exceedingly ill.
At a little before the dinner hour he came; Mrs. Berkeley
not ri&s;en. About five in the afternoon he called again,
and, hearing Mrs. Berkeley was not up, begged to &s;ee her
own maid, whom he thus addre&s;&s;ed: <Q REND="inline">"Pray, be &s;o good
as to go up to Mrs. Berkeley, and give my tendere&s;t love
to her; tell her, I long &s;o much to &s;ee her, that I beg
&s;he will permit me to go up, and &s;tand a few minutes
at her bed &s;ide, as I &s;hall not be in Canterbury again
the&s;e four days."</Q> The &s;ervant came up; Mrs. Berkeley
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"She was very &s;orry, but hoped &s;he &s;hould be able
to &s;ee him the next time he came."</Q> The &s;ervant replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Dear Madam, he is but a child, and he longs &s;o to &s;ee
you, it will half break his heart if he does not."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well,
poor dear child, let him come up then."</Q> The moment
he reached the bed &s;ide he caught Mrs. Berkeley's hand,
ki&s;&s;ed it, and bur&s;ting into tears, kneeled down, and, after
&s;obbing &s;ome time, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, my dear Madam, that
you are not dangerou&s;ly ill."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, with her
u&s;ual good &s;pirits in illne&s;s, replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Charles
I hope in God I am not. I have the old proverb on my
&s;ide, <HI>that nought is never in danger.</HI>"</Q> What would not &s;ome
per&s;ons give for a &s;on with <HI>&s;uch an heart,</HI> and a mo&s;t ex|cellent

<PB N="cxlviii" REF="156">
Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, where
every thing that kindne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, and cleverne&s;s could
execute, was prepared for him, he would perpetually &s;ay,

before <HI>he</HI> could, being obliged to keep term at the Temple,

Thurlow is returned to England; and, if he is, where

to &s;ay, &s;he was as obedient a Mother, after Mr. Berkeley
grew up, as &s;he had <HI>made</HI> him a Son in his childhood and
youth, obeyed, and &s;oon executed her commi&s;&s;ion, and
Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Thurlow came down in the &s;ame
chai&s;e, one to the Oaks, the other to Wickham, on Chri&s;t|mas
eve, the mo&s;t dreadful, cold, &s;nowing day one can re|member.
Both were almo&s;t literally frozen when they ar|rived
at Dr. Berkeley's; and it was an alarming time be|fore
they &s;eemed to feel any effect from what was given

When Dr. Berkeley, at the age of twenty-four, took from Chri&s;t Church the little living of A&s;garton, near the Vale of White Hor&s;e, he found the hou&s;e a hovel; and, having been bred in a palace, he loved a good hou&s;e.

Oaks. No &s;ooner was his arrival notified to Mrs. Berkeley,
than &s;he ordered Mr. Wright&s;on to go and tell his Ma&s;ter
a per&s;on wanted to &s;peak to him. Mrs. Berkeley conjured
him to permit her to &s;end to Dr. Beauvoir's for dear
Charles. Dr. Berkeley, with his u&s;ual good-will to man
and child, complied. John (now Mr. Wright&s;on), as the
be&s;t me&s;&s;enger, was di&s;patched, to beg that Mi&s;s Beauvoir
would order Ma&s;ter Thurlow to be arrayed in his Sunday
garb, and po&s;ted off to Dr. Berkeley's, notifying the cau&s;e.
Mrs. Berkeley ordered Mr. Wright&s;on to call out his Ma&s;|ter
when the little man arrived. Accordingly, in a few
minutes, Dr. Berkeley, looking like a beautiful guardian|angel
of tho&s;e <Q REND="inline">"<HI>little ones</HI>"</Q> mentioned by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord,
entered the drawing-room, leading in his little <HI>proteg&eacute;,</HI>
whom he pre&s;ented to the Dean. <Q REND="inline">"Here, my old friend, is

que&s;tions generally put to children. In the afternoon he
told him to &s;tand by him at the card-table; and when the
time arrived for Charles to make his bow and return to
Dr. Beauvoir's, the Dean, who had won about a guinea,
<HI>generou&s;ly</HI> pre&s;ented poor dear Charles with <HI>two and &s;ixpence;</HI>
for which he made one of his graceful French bows, and re|tired.
They never met again, until they met in the regions

poor Thurlow could be found <HI>worthy</HI> of a place to behold
the glory of the <Q REND="inline">"ANGEL of the Church of Durham."</Q> The
re&s;emblance in face and per&s;on of Mr. Thurlow to the Bi|&s;hop
was remarkably &s;triking to all the company, allowing
only that the tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of his mind were
entirely Lynch and Wake, which threw a look of benevo|lence
into his features and countenance, which did <HI>not ap|pear</HI>

<P>About the year 1786 there died at Canterbury a very
excellent young man, an old &s;chool-fellow of Mr. Berkeley's,
Mr. George Ha&s;ted, &s;on of the Author of the Hi&s;tory of
Kent. On Mr. Berkeley's arrival, in vacation-time, Mrs.
Berkeley a&s;ked her Son <Q REND="inline">"if he was not afflicted at the

When he was about thirteen years old, the news of the day
<PB N="clvi" REF="164">
was, a run-a-way match of a young man of rank. A gentle|man

<P>Mr. Berkeley was certainly a very extraordinary proof of
the ble&s;&s;ed effects of education. A witty friend of the

not my Mother, I would bribe her with five hun|dred

Of Mr. Monck Berkeley's genius many of tho&s;e who have
redde what he has written may be competent judges. To
attempt to do ju&s;tice to the exqui&s;ite amiability, genero&s;ity,

&s;oundne&s;s of his judgement, even in early youth, requires
the knowledge of the Editor, and the pen of his favourite
Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>His attentions to the poor, from his childhood, were un|remitting.
The arguments of his Mother to di&s;&s;uade
him from wa&s;ting his alms on common beggars, tho&s;e hor|rid
robbers of the hone&s;t labouring poor, were all in vain.
His an&s;wer always was, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I am fully con|vinced
of the truth of your rea&s;oning; and, I do believe,
I never did relieve a common beggar in my life that was
not a <HI>vaut-rein;</HI> yet, &s;hould I ever hear that any poor
creature had peri&s;hed, who had a&s;ked charity of me, and
I had not relieved him, I know I never could forgive
my&s;elf through life."</Q> So well was his character known
to the&s;e wretches, that they frequently a&s;ked in the village
near which his Father re&s;ided, <Q REND="inline">"If the 'Squire was at home,
for if he is not, it is not worth while to turn out of the
way to the hou&s;e, as the Doctor and the Lady never <HI>give
any thing to</HI> POOR TRAVELLERS."</Q> The fact is certain,
that they never came but when Mr. Berkeley was in
the country, which occa&s;ioned Mrs. Berkeley's telling her
Son, <HI>that they were his vi&s;itors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="clix" REF="167">
Mr. Berkeley, as has been ob&s;erved above, was remarka|bly
generous, and had what is commonly called a <HI>princely</HI>
&s;pirit. His beautiful brother was very &s;aving, and even co|vetous;
he never parted with his money, but to the poor,
to whom he was very liberal indeed. So careful was he
of his money, that it u&s;ed to be a diver&s;ion to his Father
and Aunt to borrow &s;ixpence of him, and then tell him
that they were poor, and could not pay him: he would go
to his Mother, and de&s;ire her to <HI>talk</HI> to them, and tell
them, <Q REND="inline">"that it was not <HI>hone&s;t</HI> to borrow of people, and not
pay them again, and that <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> he could not afford to
lo&s;e his money."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, when a child, once went and &s;old
his buckles, to relieve a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s. When at Eton,
being unable to relieve a very large poor family near Bray|wood
Side, to whom his Father had been exceedingly
bountiful, and the family being at Canterbury, he wrote to
his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I beg of you to &s;end five or three guineas to
the&s;e poor creatures. My cou&s;in," (the very worthy Re|verend
J. Hayes, <HI>then</HI> &s;econd &s;on of James Hayes, E&s;quire,
Berkeley's amiable protector and director when he went to
Eton,) "and my&s;elf have given them all the money that
we have; but they are very poor &s;till."</Q> Not getting an
an&s;wer as &s;oon as he wi&s;hed, he ri&s;qued a flogging, and
contrived, in company with an equally daring friend, to
&s;camper over to Cookham; there he &s;old his little poney,
<PB N="clx" REF="168">
and &s;ent them the money. A youth going from Canter|bury
School to Oxford, when Mr. Berkeley was about
twelve years old, he pre&s;ented him with his watch, chain,
and &s;eal; for which being &s;harply reproved by his Mother,
he &s;weetly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I am but a boy, and he is
going to be a man; and it mu&s;t be unplea&s;ant to him not
to have a watch, and I know he cannot afford to buy
one, and I can contrive to &s;hift without one."</Q> Such
was ever the nature of this lovely young man.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was, from his early youth, de&s;tined for the
Bar; where, had it plea&s;ed God to have &s;pared his life,

to improve in logic, to undertake the <HI>wrong</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion,

that, if he found his cau&s;e to be an unju&s;t one, he would

firmly re&s;olved never to plead <HI>again&s;t</HI> the fatherle&s;s, the
widow, or the clergy; and always to plead <HI>gratis</HI> for them,
if their circum&s;tances required it.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that although Mr. Berkeley was
<HI>highly</HI> indebted to <HI>what</HI> we commonly call Nature, with
&s;trict propriety to the God of Nature, for a very uncom|monly
fine under&s;tanding, quick ready wit, and, what does
not always accompany it, a very extraordinary &s;trength and
&s;oundne&s;s of judgement, &s;o as often to occa&s;ion per&s;ons to
remark, that he had all the brilliancy of Bi&s;hop Berkeley's
imagination, and all the &s;ound, &s;trong judgement of Mr.
Cherry, of whom the great Charles Le&s;lie, the celebrated
controver&s;ial writer, u&s;ed to &s;ay, he thought God had not
<PB N="clxii" REF="170">
be&s;towed better judgement on man &s;ince the days of Solo|mon.
When Mr. Berkeley, with all his great vivacity in
early youth, often acted with the &s;upreme&s;t caution, Mrs.
Berkeley u&s;ed, to the great diver&s;ion of Dr. Berkeley, to
&s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"It was a happy thing for her children, that &s;he in|troduced

<P>It is hoped the introduction of a little anecdote concern|ing
the zeal of this worthy gentleman, for the &s;alvation of

man of good fortune, in every &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>a fine lady,</HI>
was a little talked of as having a partiality for one of her
men-&s;ervants. The excellent vicar took an early opportu|nity,
when he knew her hu&s;band was ab&s;ent, to call upon
her; finding her alone, he &s;oon began the &s;ubject. She
heard him with &s;eeming attention for &s;ome time; at length
&s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frin&s;ham, you may &s;ave your&s;elf any

he made a bow, and told her, he hoped God would, in

Mr. Frin&s;ham was as witty as he was good; in his youth
the idol of all his acquaintance, as what is termed the fid|dle

<P>It is hoped, that the following little tribute of a grateful

A buck, a blood, a Newmarket jockey, made a prie&s;t of the Mo&s;t High God at twenty-four, does often, by thirty-four, or forty-four, begin to feel the value of his own and the &s;ouls committed to his charge.

Mr. Frin&s;ham being what was called a Tory, and all his

Mr. Frin&s;ham, perhaps naturally the mo&s;t contented-tempered

were the WHIG mini&s;ters of George the Second.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable, that Mr. Frin&s;ham never met
with any &s;erious affliction through life. The lo&s;s of his
beautiful mother, when he was five years old, was &s;o &s;up|plied
by an excellent hou&s;ekeeper of his father's, that he
&s;carcely felt it; and the death of his worthy father, at
the age of eighty-one, not long before his own death, was
an event to be expected at that age, although he died, as
before mentioned, by ca&s;ualty. Mr. Frin&s;ham was in|terred
clo&s;e to his honoured father-in-law, Francis Cherry,
E&s;quire, within the railed burial place in Shotte&s;brooke
church-yard. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I am God's creature;
he &s;ent me into the world <HI>when</HI> he plea&s;ed, and he
will take me out <HI>how</HI> he plea&s;es: and I am &s;ure
it will be at the <HI>be&s;t</HI> time, in the <HI>be&s;t</HI> way."</Q> He dreaded
nothing in life &s;o much as lo&s;ing the be&s;t of wives, and
the being left with two little girls, whom he humoured in
<HI>every thing</HI> not in it&s;elf wrong.</P>
<P>Some proofs how much Mr. Berkeley was indebted to
education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a
lad, a youth, and a man, when it is con&s;idered that he was
a&s;toni&s;hingly proud whil&s;t a child.</P>
<P><PB N="clxxii" REF="180">
When Mr. Monck Berkeley was aged three years and
two months, his father went to re&s;ide at Acton near Lon|don,
a large living, pre&s;ented to him by his ONLY patron
through life, the excellent Archbi&s;hop Secker, and which
he &s;o nobly re&s;igned, to a man, who, after making him
repair the tithe barn, and letting him have about five hun|dred
pounds' worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hun|dred
and eighty pounds&mdash;(among&s;t which was a harp&s;ichord,
that co&s;t Bi&s;hop Berkeley &s;eventy guineas, for <HI>four pounds</HI>&mdash;Mrs.
Berkeley objected; but the Doctor, with his wonted
genero&s;ity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he hated di&s;putes among clergy;"</Q> and
therefore permitted him to have it at his own price)&mdash;after
&s;uffering the hou&s;e to &s;tand empty from Michaelmas to the
end of April&mdash;came upon him with a long bill for dila|pidations,
and prote&s;ted a draught drawn on him by Dr.
Berkeley for the money for the furniture. This naturally
exa&s;perated the too generous mind that had been the ac|tual
pre&s;enter of the living; for no power on earth, no ho|nour,
could have compelled any one to re&s;ign it. But Dr.
Berkeley one day a&s;king the Archbi&s;hop if his Grace meant
he &s;hould re&s;ign Action on becoming Prebendary of Canter|bury,
his reply was, <Q REND="inline">"Don't be in ha&s;te. You mu&s;t talk
one day or other with Lord Hardwicke about it."</Q> Before
any conference with Lord Hardwicke, the good Archbi&s;hop
died; and the nice honour of Dr. Berkeley, without ever
even &s;eeing Lord Hardwick, made him re&s;ign it to a cou&s;in|german
of his Lord&s;hip&mdash;a very different man from his
<PB N="clxxiii" REF="181">
noble relation. A very intimate friend of Dr. Berkeley's,
the excellent <HI>throughly</HI> Honourable and Reverend Mr. Ha|milton
of Taplow, felt &s;uch re&s;entment, that he conjured
Dr. Berkeley to po&s;t the <HI>man</HI> every where. Mr. Ha|milton
had one excellent rule; he never would call any
man a gentleman, if in any in&s;tance he had acted unlike a
gentleman.</P>
<P>In a very few days after the arrival of the family at Ac|ton,
Mrs. Berkeley heard a mo&s;t violent &s;tamping and
&s;creaming of her then only child. On enquiry into the
cau&s;e, it was found to be, that Ma&s;ter Berkeley would not
go to bed up the back &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What ails him?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, you know, Madam, there is only one
&s;tair-ca&s;e at Bray. But Ma&s;ter Berkeley &s;ays there are

and all vi&s;itors, go up the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and <HI>only</HI> the
&s;ervants up the back &s;tairs; and that he is as good a gen|tleman
as his Papa, although he is not &s;o old; and that
he will not go up the back &s;tairs."</Q></P>
<P>An order was immediately made, and &s;trictly adhered to,
that he was not, for a <HI>whole</HI> week, (a long time for a crea|ture
of three feet high,) to pre&s;ume, in the day time, to
go up or down the great &s;tair-ca&s;e to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, to

When about four years old, Mr. Berkeley received a &s;mart
trimming, for a &s;peech to a once famous apothecary in Lon|don,
who had retired to Acton, Mr. Sawtell, who&s;e ap|pearance
was rather again&s;t him. He attended Dr. Berke|ley
when unwell, and Charles Stanley Monck, of Grange
Gormonde, E&s;quire, ill about four months at Dr. Berke|ley's
with the whooping cough, which he brought from
Eton School, and communicated to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>poor</HI> is introduced on account of his very &s;evere &s;ufferings for more than &s;even months. Dr. Berkeley, having never been at any &s;chool, had, unluckily, e&s;caped all tho&s;e di&s;orders which children, together with many other benefits, generally get at good &s;chools. The whooping-cough is a tremendous di&s;order, indeed, to adults&mdash;Dr. Berkeley could not exi&s;t without going into fre&s;h air every three or four days. It co&s;t him more than an hundred guineas. The agonies &s;uffered by the Editor during &s;ome parts of that time were ex|ceedingly great. Laughing con&s;tantly brought on a violent fit of coughing. Innumerable were the times that the Editor has &s;at trembling with angui&s;h, ex|pecting that her beloved partner would expire hanging on the window; his only hope of relief being to throw up the &s;a&s;h, and hang out at it, ga&s;ping for breath. Mr. James Hamilton, and the as <HI>witty Samuel Horne,</HI> &s;pent the &s;um|mer with him.

None can laugh at this account, who has ever had the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;eeing an adult under the paroxy&s;ms of the whooping cough. An old friend of Mrs. Berkeley's, more advanced in life than Dr. Berkeley, often fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor, the late Rev. Mr. Chapman, the beloved friend of the late Dr. Booth, Dean of Wind&s;or.</NOTE>poor Dr. Berkeley and
his little boy. This proud de&s;cendant of fallen Adam thus

really a&s;k the poor man one day to dinner, to &s;hew
that he has not heard any thing of the kind from you

<P>Mr. Berkeley was always told, that a gentleman mu&s;t
never do mean or &s;habby actions. He <HI>rea&s;oned</HI> on the
matter, and, in early infancy, drew &s;uch <HI>wonderful</HI> conclu|&s;ions
as tho&s;e ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>That both Mr. Berkeley and his Brother were, in <HI>very
very</HI> early youth exceedingly proud is ab&s;olutely certain, in
their different ways; and that both became remarkably
humble, by their Mother's adhering clo&s;ely to the direc|tions
given to parents in that wonderful book the Proverbs
of Solomon, is equally certain.</P>
<P>The exqui&s;ite loveline&s;s of Mr. Monck Berkeley's nature
led him, from an infant, to look with pity on all below
him; but his dear Brother naturally looked with contempt.
One day, when very young, going in the coach with their
Mother to Marlow, as they pa&s;&s;ed a remarkably &s;mall, mean|looking
cottage at the foot of the hill, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My
dear Mamma, look there: did you ever &s;ee &s;o mi&s;erable
a looking hut? What kind of <HI>creatures</HI> mu&s;t they be that

and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"ROBERT! what have I ju&s;t heard you

<P>Once pa&s;&s;ing a little chimney-&s;weeper, about his own

never daring to <HI>order</HI> them to do any thing, being always
told, that they were not their &s;ervants, but their Father's:
therefore they mu&s;t always &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, John (or Thomas),
get me &s;o or &s;o."</Q> By ince&s;&s;ant attention, and the utmo&s;t
vigilance, their pride was kept under, and, in due time,
by God's grace, eradicated.</P>
<P>It was no &s;mall delight to his Mother, on his arrival in
England, at the age of near twenty-two, that &s;he could
&s;carcely go into any &s;mall &s;hop in Canterbury without hear|ing,
from the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! Madam, what a
fine young gentleman Mr. Berkeley is; &s;o conde&s;cending!
he met my poor &s;on, &s;topped, and a&s;ked him, how he
did? and hoped he went on well in the world. Who
would have thought he would have done him the honour
to remember him &s;o many years?"</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remarked here, that Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Bodies do
<HI>&s;ome</HI> good. At Canterbury, the Dean and Prebendaries pay
for the education of fifty trade&s;men's &s;ons, find them books,
&amp;c. until they are eighteen or nineteen; and then, if they
<PB N="clxxvii" REF="189">
wi&s;h it, rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription to &s;end them to one of the
Univer&s;ities. Many other cathedrals have &s;imilar charitable
in&s;titutions. This produces a &s;ort of honourable equality,
as it enables the &s;ons of chairmen, footmen, &amp;c. when
ordained, to a&s;&s;ociate with their &s;uperiors in birth, perhaps
not in learning.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's amiability was the more remarked, as he
quitted the King's School at the age of twelve, and his
Father removed his family to his living in We&s;t Kent the
year following, and returned not to &s;ettle in Canterbury
until the end of the year 1784; when it became his turn
to take the offices. A good old &s;hopman one day &s;aid to
Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Madam, what a charming man Mr.
Berkeley is. He was <HI>galloping</HI> towards Margate, looking
like a <HI>young Lord,</HI> when one of our poor old neighbours
was creeping along. He &s;uddenly &s;topped his hor&s;e,
drew up to the cau&s;eway, and a&s;ked him who he was,
and if he was comfortable? He took out his pur&s;e, and,
not finding much &s;ilver, bade his &s;ervant lend him half
a crown; which he gave to the poor man, and told him
to call upon him if ever he wanted any thing:"</Q> adding,
his eyes filling with tears, <Q REND="inline">"Lord ble&s;s him! where will
you find another young gentleman, going galloping on his
plea&s;ure, that will think &s;o of the poor?"</Q> It proved to
be the famous old News-carrier, of whom the fine print
was &s;old &s;ome years ago in Canterbury.</P>
<P><PB N="clxxviii" REF="190">
The poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed were ever the grand objects of
his tender care. When at St. Andrew's, one night, at the
play, the poor man who acted the king in the tragedy
fainted away; and it had nearly been a <HI>real</HI> tragedy, as he
had &s;everal &s;mall children. On enquiry, it was found
to be from inanition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The next day the Editor &s;ent her faithful, affectionate, tru&s;ty, aged, Scotch &s;ervant, the excellent Betty Ru&s;&s;el, to enquire particularly into the &s;tate of the&s;e heroes and heroines of the &s;tage. The worthy woman &s;oon re|turned, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Well-a-day, Madam, I never &s;aw &s;uch an <HI>unka</HI> &s;ight in all my life; there was the poor <HI>crator,</HI> who is to be queen to night, the king's wife that fainted la&s;t night, with her head dre&s;&s;ed all in flowers and ribbons, and a fine crown, and a child &s;ucking at her brea&s;t quite empty, it had not a drop of milk in it&mdash;&s;he had had nothing but water all day&mdash;oh! it was an <HI>unka</HI> &s;ight to &s;ee her head &s;o fine, her brea&s;t hanging like a wet leather glove."</Q> That uncommonly hone&s;t, worthy woman, Elizabeth Ru&s;&s;el, met with mo&s;t kind, charitable friends, on Dr. Berkeley's family leaving St. Andrew's, in the amiable, excellent, and by them highly re&s;pected, Dr. Adam&s;on, &s;enior Kirk Mini&s;ter of St. Andrew's, and his worthy very charita|ble lady. The Editor u&s;ed to delight to &s;end her a guinea, in a letter to Dr. Adam&s;on, until twice <HI>&s;ome</HI> po&s;t-ma&s;ter &s;topped it.</NOTE>. Mr. Berkeley, on finding that to
be the ca&s;e, po&s;ted off to his tutor, the very amiable (now
Reverend) Mr. James Bruce, be&s;eeching him to go and
relieve him on his account. On Mrs. Berkeley's &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"Why did not you go your&s;elf, in&s;tead of routing out Mr.
Bruce?"</Q> He wi&s;ely replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, the wo|man
was exceedingly beautiful; and my going might have
injured her fame, which, I hear, although an actre&s;s,
is un&s;ullied. So now you know why I got Bruce to go."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clxxix" REF="191">
Mr. Berkeley had certainly no offen&s;ive pride di&s;covera|ble
to tho&s;e who knew him mo&s;t intimately; for, what is
u&s;ually termed Family Pride is &s;urely improperly &s;o called.
A man, that is de&s;cended from a King rather than from a
cobler, from a Hero rather than from a Huck&s;ter, may feel
grateful to his Maker. Mr. Berkeley's Father felt it, his
Grandfather felt it, and perhaps he felt it on becoming a
Bi&s;hop. Some friend &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t now give
purple liveries."</Q> To which the good Bi&s;hop replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. My becoming a Bi&s;hop will not make me give
up what the dome&s;tics of my ance&s;tors have worn for
centuries."</Q> Accordingly his epi&s;copal livery was the yel|low
green coat worne by the &s;ervants of his honourable re|lations,
the Earl of Berkeley, Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
his Brothers, &amp;c. with royal, <HI>i.e.</HI> red purple wai&s;tcoats,
&amp;c. and the &s;ervants of his Sons he always made wear the
crim&s;on wai&s;tcoat, &amp;c. that he might not give up his fa|mily
livery. Dr. Berkeley's coach being to be new painted,
the coach-maker &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, Sir, you will have a
cypher in&s;tead of your coat of arms. It is all the fa|&s;hion."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"That may be, Sir; but, if you plea&s;e, put
on my coat. It is an <HI>old one,</HI> to be &s;ure. The cypher is
very well for Nabobs and Planters, to &s;ave them trouble."</Q>
It was a great diver&s;ion, when Mr. Berkeley was &s;eventeen or
eighteen, to a lovely young lady, who&s;e death Mr. Berkeley
lamented in a mo&s;t beautiful elegy, printed, but never &s;old,
to wink on Mrs. Berkeley, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, one day or other

Berkeley will marry a girl with an hundred thou&s;and
pounds, and change his name to Hickenbottom."</Q> (Vide
Kit Smart.) He u&s;ed to &s;torm, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Harriet, hold
your tongue: I will not change my name for a million."</Q>
Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Ancient family is a feather, but it is a

<P>When the vile treati&s;e on Education, written by that
learned Athei&s;t, the late Lord Kaimes, made its appearance,
it was immediately in every hand. When Mr. Berkeley
came to the part where Lord Kaimes &s;peaks of the Eton
<HI>Montem,</HI> he &s;tormed violently indeed; he felt <HI>l'e&s;prit du corps</HI>
&s;o violently as to amu&s;e all his friends. He a&s;&s;ured his
Father and the gentlemen of the agreeable &s;ociety of Cook|ham
above de&s;cribed, that, had they been educated at Eton,
they would feel equal indignation. His mother a&s;&s;ured him,
that men of forty-&s;even were rarely as irritable as youths of
&s;eventeen; to which Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Madam,
I can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it
by, and not read one line more."</Q> She, laughing, a&s;ked,
<Q REND="inline">"If Lord Kaimes had abu&s;ed dear Mrs. Sheeles's &s;chool?"</Q>
He replied, <Q REND="inline">"Much wor&s;e than that: I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear
Madam, with <HI>all your calmne&s;s,</HI> you will be ready to throw
it into the fire."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley reque&s;ted to be in|formed;
but her Son politely declined it, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"No;
read on, my dear Madam."</Q> It is certain, that when &s;he
<PB N="clxxxi" REF="193">
came to the page where Lord Kaimes &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I would
advi&s;e you to be of the Chri&s;tian religion, becau&s;e it
is (or it happens to be) the religion of the country
where you were born,"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley verified her Son's
prediction, for &s;he never thought it worth while to go on
with &s;uch a wretch on Education. His Lord&s;hip's Treati&s;e
on Hu&s;bandry is an excellent work.</P>
<P>The following anecdote of that dreadful Athei&s;t may be
depended on as a fact. It was related to the Editor by a
lady incapable of forging it, to whom it was related by an
eye and ear witne&s;s of the &s;cene. When a divorce has
actually taken place, it is no &s;candal to &s;peak of the di|vorced
female as having lo&s;t her character. Lord Kaimes's
daughter was married to Mr. Heron, a gentleman of
very large fortune in Scotland, of mo&s;t excellent cha|racter,
and uncommonly amiable gentle manners, &s;ay all
who have the happine&s;s of his acquaintance. The Editor
was well acquainted with the elegant worthy Major Heron,
his younger brother, when that favourite regiment, of
Canterbury families of fa&s;hion, the Scotch Greys, were
quartered at Canterbury. This lady was at length detected,
and gently and quietly &s;ent home to her WORTHY father,
with a letter from her excellent injured hu&s;band, &s;tating her
conduct. She reached her father's hou&s;e in the afternoon.
In the evening, after tea, Lord Kaimes walked up and
down the room in &s;ilence, but appeared greatly agitated.
<PB N="clxxxii" REF="194">
At length he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child! how could
you act thus? How could you bring me to &s;uch &s;hameful
di&s;grace?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, my Lord, you have always told me,
that there was no other world; that the idea of an here|after
was all a JUGGLE of knaves and prie&s;ts to keep fools
in order; and, as I am not to be called to any account,
but by the world&mdash;I preferred Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to my hu&s;|band."</Q>
This &s;ilenced his Lord&s;hip: he &s;aid not a &s;ingle
word more, and &s;oon quitted the room. Mr. Heron, her
much injured hu&s;band, has, for many years, enjoyed great
felicity with a lady very differently educated from the
daughter of Lord Kaimes. May he long enjoy it!</P>
<P>In a few days after reading the book above mentioned,
when the &s;ocial meeting happened to be at Dr. Berkeley's,
ju&s;t before tea, the very learned Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> either took
off the &s;lab behind him, or out of his pocket a new&s;paper
(neither that amiable gentleman nor the Editor can recol|lect
which; if it was Dr. Berkeley's paper, it was the St.
James's Chronicle, as he was always partial to that paper,
on account of his old fellow collegian, Mr. Colman), and
began reading a letter to Lord Kaimes, concerning his very
&s;evere attack on Eton School, proving to the learned Lord,
that he was totally ignorant of what he had been &s;o gro&s;ly
abu&s;ing. Every one admired it exceedingly. Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Berkeley, this letter mu&s;t delight you prodi|giou&s;ly,
&s;urely. Eton is nobly vindicated indeed. The
<PB N="clxxxiii" REF="195">
Writer is quite of your &s;pirit."</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied,
<Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, every man educated there mu&s;t be indignant
to find him&s;elf and his friends &s;tyled <HI>Highwaymen!</HI>"</Q> Mr.
M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> proceeded to read on, and &s;aid, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I believe, Berkeley mu&s;t have written
this letter him&s;elf."</Q> To which Mrs. Berkeley replied,
<Q REND="inline">"HE write &s;uch a letter, poor dear &s;oul! poor as I am, I
would give a thou&s;and pounds that he could, three years
hence, write &s;uch a letter as that."</Q> To which Dr. Berke|ley
added, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, poor fellow, I hope, if he is not idle,
he may, <HI>in time,</HI> write as well as this Eton champion."</Q></P>
<P>About &s;even years afterwards Mr. Berkeley, &s;itting con|ver&s;ing
with his Mother in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My

<P>Mr. Berkeley, from the time he went to Eton, u&s;ed very
acutely to learn his Mother's opinion of any little thing he
was going to publi&s;h in a New&s;paper or Magazine, without
her even &s;u&s;pecting him as the author, by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"It was
written by an Eton boy of his acquaintance;"</Q> le&s;t, as he
told her when he grew up, maternal partiality might tempt
her to think it clever when it was not &s;o; or the &s;ame ten|derne&s;s
might tempt her to wi&s;h it &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, le&s;t it &s;hould
expo&s;e him to ridicule.</P>
<P>On Mr. Berkeley's <HI>printing</HI> his "Maria, or The Gene|rous
Ru&s;tic," written when he was only &s;eventeen, the
copies were &s;ent down to him. One day after dinner, he
went to his &s;tudy, and brought a copy of it in &s;heets, &s;ay|ing.
<Q REND="inline">"He would read &s;omething that he hoped might
amu&s;e his Father and the ladies."</Q> He began; and Dr.
Berkeley, who had eyes like a lynx, &s;eeing it in &s;heets, im|mediately
exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heavens, child! what have
you done? This is written by you. Surely, you have
not gone and publi&s;hed &s;ome non&s;en&s;e that will ruin your

Mrs. Berkeley, <HI>mother-like,</HI> in agony to think that her

could correct. He could write admirably, as the world
has &s;een; but any thing &s;ent him to correct he always
re-made, generally perhaps for the better&mdash;but then, as his
Son, through life, u&s;ed to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the book is

The calling the idea of a Marquis, even a French Marquis,

bears the title of We&s;tmorland; Mr. Berkeley having al|ways

for his &s;pirited wi&s;e conduct in quitting a great

The next day Mr. Berkeley and his Mother dining alone,

<P>It has been mentioned above, that Mr. Berkeley was in|debted

<P>A very hone&s;t old woman, who had lived many years at

where, to be &s;ure, young fools, if not <HI>properly</HI> placed, may
fall into mi&s;chief, as in the army, the navy, and the mer|chant's
or banker's counting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible argument that a man of
his &s;en&s;e could devi&s;e, to per&s;uade Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;end
Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to Dr. Gla&s;&s;e at Harrow, underr who&s;e care, a

Barrymore, and the pre&s;ent Earl of Ma&s;&s;areen, and his
<PB N="cxciv" REF="206">
brothers, the Honourable Me&s;&s;rs. Skeffington. Dr. Berke|ley
was de&s;ired by the ladies to fix the &s;alary. The two
peers paid each four hundred pounds a year; they had
hor&s;es kept for them: the others paid one hundred. But
Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, after deliberating &s;ome time, declared &s;he
<HI>dreaded</HI> her &s;on's being made <HI>too</HI> religious if he went to Dr.
Gla&s;&s;e. She lived to feel, <HI>bitterly</HI> feel, the direful want of
religion in two of her &s;ons. The elde&s;t, immediately on
his father's death, turning her out of the hou&s;e in town,

out of town to make a vi&s;it in the North, kindly lent
hers, &s;he mu&s;t have taken a lodging. Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was
the mo&s;t indulgent mother in the world; &s;he attended to
her children's food, their phy&s;ic, their warm cloathing, &amp;c.
but &s;he left the care of their &s;ouls to&mdash;SATAN, and HE was
not wanting in his attentions. One of them had naturally
a good under&s;tanding; but neither Lord nor Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> were
equal to the ta&s;k of directing it aright, nor by any
means equal to the &s;till much harder ta&s;k of cultivating and
directing weak Minds. Poor Lady!&mdash;&s;he lived to <HI>feel</HI> the
threat of the Wi&s;e King <HI>&s;orely</HI> verified: <Q REND="inline">"A child left to

to imply, that in tho&s;e <HI>ignorant, unenlightened</HI> times the

the MOTHER. The very &s;en&s;ible Lord Halifax, in his Ad|vice

This book mu&s;t become very &s;carce, &s;ince a very learned
gentleman, about a year ago, a&s;&s;ured the Editor he had
never even <HI>heard</HI> of &s;uch a book. It is pity that more fa|thers
do not put it early into the hands of their daughters.
It might contribute greatly in preventing hu&s;bands being
obliged to exhibit many unhappy creatures at Doctors
Commons and the Hou&s;e of Lords. Between the Wi&s;e
King and the Wi&s;e Peer, if both were duly &s;tudied, young
gentlemen and young ladies might certainly be very dif|ferent
beings from what many in the pre&s;ent time are.</P>
<P>Solomon, when he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Train up a child in the way
he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from
it,"</Q> does by no means imply, that he &s;hall not, through
life, depart from it; he departed lamentably from it him|&s;elf;
but having, as we well know, received an excellent
education from his pious preceptor, Nathan the prophet,
he returned into the paths of virtue and piety before his
death. The late Archdeacon of Berk&s;hire, the very learned
Dr. Dodwell, in an excellent &s;ermon on <Q REND="inline">"One man in a
thou&s;and have I found,"</Q> &amp;c. told his audience, that pro|bably
that great King owed the &s;alvation of his &s;oul to the
admonitions of his beloved friend, the &s;on of Nathan, who
certainly, in tho&s;e times, when Monarchs were ab&s;olutely
<PB N="cxcvi" REF="208">
arbitrary, <Q REND="inline">"put his life in his hand, to &s;ave the &s;oul of his
&s;overeign, by admoni&s;hing him to return to the paths of
piety."</Q></P>
<P>It was an high act of friend&s;hip in the late excellent
S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">z, one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to a
King who reigned over the&s;e realms not <HI>quite</HI> a century
ago, to admoni&s;h his ma&s;ter frequently of the heinous &s;in
of adultery. To do the Briti&s;h Prince ju&s;tice, although he
did not like the Jewi&s;h Prince reform, he never re&s;ented the
liberty taken. The nick-name of this gentleman, before
that of Methodi&s;t had, like Aaron's rod, &s;wallowed up all
others, was, Praying S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">z. He <HI>prayed</HI> on earth; he
is now <HI>prai&s;ing</HI> in heaven.</P>
<P>So terrifying is the idea of being &s;tyled a Methodi&s;t be|come
of late, that within the&s;e few weeks the Editor (who
never was in a Methodi&s;t meeting but once in her life,
about twenty-five years ago, with a large party at Canterbury,
to hear &s;ome dull abu&s;e from that accompli&s;hed old hypocrite,
John We&s;ley) advi&s;ing a young gentleman to read a &s;mall
portion of the Bible every day to his &s;ervants, replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam, I &s;hould be reckoned a Methodi&s;t

<P>To attempt to do ju&s;tice to Mr. Monck Berkeley's grati|tude
to many noble relations, friends, and connexions,
from his fir&s;t entrance into what is called <HI>life,</HI> would re|quire
abilities far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of an almo&s;t dying fe|male,
by whom he had been taught from infancy, that he
had no <HI>right</HI> to expect any thing but what is u&s;ual, the
common decent civilities of life, from any but his Parents;
that every thing beyond that was to be repaid by gratitude,
as more than his due.</P>
<P>His gratitude to the eminently learned Profe&s;&s;or Hunter
of St. Andrew's, in offering Dr. Berkeley to become him|&s;elf
Mr. Berkeley's tutor, if Dr. Berkeley did not entirely
approve of Mr. Bruce, an <HI>eleve</HI> of Mr. Hunter, was through
life gratefully remembered by him; but Dr. Berkeley found
the Profe&s;&s;or's character of Mr. Bruce to be perfectly ju&s;t.
Dr. Berkeley accordingly a&s;ked Mr. Bruce the value of his
<HI>whole</HI> time, de&s;ired him to di&s;mi&s;s all his other pupils, and
devote him&s;elf entirely to the care of Mr. Berkeley; which
he did for a con&s;iderable time, until the arrival of his dear
friend Mr. Grim&s;ton, who came on Mr. Berkeley's account,
and entered at St. Andrew's, and an old intimate Eton friend
of Mr. Berkeley's in the &s;ame form with him there. Being
all, as it is termed, reading the &s;ame books, they could
<PB N="cxcviii" REF="210">
not interfere; and Mr. Berkeley, amiably wi&s;hing to benefit
Mr. Bruce, whom he exceedingly loved, reque&s;ted his Fa|ther
to permit him to become tutor to tho&s;e two gentle|men
only, from both of whom he received a large &s;alary,
which enabled him, a few years after, to enter at Emanuel
College, Cambridge, under the protection of Dr. Berkeley's
much loved and re&s;pected friend, the celebrated and worthy
Dr. Farmer.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude through life to tho&s;e who in|&s;tructed
him was uniform. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"If <HI>I would
not</HI> learn, <HI>that</HI> was not <HI>their</HI> fault."</Q> He u&s;ed always to
boa&s;t to his Father, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, <HI>idle</HI> as <HI>you</HI> may think me,
I can a&s;&s;ert, with &s;tricte&s;t truth, that I never have once
bowed at Profe&s;&s;or Hill's, Hunter's, or indeed at any
Profe&s;&s;or's lectures."</Q> An explanation being reque&s;ted of
the word <HI>bowing,</HI> it was thus given: <Q REND="inline">"Why, if any poor
fellow has been a little idle, and is not prepared to &s;peak
when called upon by the Profe&s;&s;or, he gets up and makes
a re&s;pectful bow, and &s;its down again."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's friend&s;hip for his very learned tutor, the
Reverend Mr. Green, on who&s;e &s;ole account he was by his
Father &s;ent to Magdalene Hall, rather than to his own be|loved
Chri&s;t Church, was very great. Mr. Berkeley con&s;i|dered
him as the mo&s;t active and vigilant of tutors, who
would <HI>force</HI> young men to learn, whether &s;o di&s;po&s;ed or
<PB N="cxcix" REF="211">
not, and the great care he took of their morals, devoting
almo&s;t the whole of his lei&s;ure time to the common room.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was ble&s;t with a wonderful &s;agacity in
di&s;cerning characters, and often exhibiting them to the di|ver&s;ion
of his friends, even when the per&s;ons who&s;e cha|racters
he drew were pre&s;ent. He u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay
to his Father and Aunt, <Q REND="inline">"Now I will treat you with an
exhibition of my Mother la&s;t night at Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s
rout;"</Q> and then proceed, generally &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Well! to
be &s;ure <HI>my</HI> Mother is a woman by her&s;elf; for I believe
the Almighty never formed any thing before her, or ever
will any thing after her, like her&s;elf. The whole world
cannot make her &s;ay a thing &s;he does not mean, make
her an&s;wer a que&s;tion &s;he does not choo&s;e to an&s;wer, nor
vi&s;it any body &s;he does not choo&s;e to vi&s;it, unle&s;s once
or twice, where my Father has interpo&s;ed his ROYAL AU|THORITY;
then &s;he reluctantly &s;ets off."</Q> This latter
part aro&s;e from Mrs. Berkeley's re&s;olution, through life,
never to vi&s;it any cook, hou&s;e-maid, &amp;c. who had been
kind enough to live with a gentleman &s;ix or &s;even years be|fore
&s;he was &s;anctioned from Doctors Commons to &s;tep into
the coach and &s;ix, and &s;it at the head of the table, and
be care&s;&s;ed by all the <HI>amiable</HI> virtuous dames in the neigh|bourhood.
Mrs. Berkeley is by no means one of tho&s;e
&s;tyled by Mr. Addi&s;on <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the outrageou&s;ly virtuous;</HI>"</Q> <HI>tout au
contraire</HI>&mdash;and her kindne&s;s in re&s;toring more than one fallen
<PB N="cc" REF="212">
acquaintance, the wives of gentlemen, they gentlewomen,
mothers of large families of young children, is well known
to many who will read the&s;e &s;heets through curio&s;ity. But
the ca&s;e is widely different. Mary or Nan, if tolerably
cunning wenches, rea&s;on thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is hit or mi&s;s. If I
live with the 'Squire &s;even years&mdash;if I can draw him in
to marry me, why, I am a <HI>fine Laady</HI> for life; and if I
can't, why I &s;hall do ju&s;t as well for <HI>Bob the Po&s;tillion.</HI>"</Q>
Agreed: but you ought not to be company for ladies of
virtue, birth, and education; nor are ye, or ever &s;hall be,
for one in&s;ignificant individual, who more than once,
in&s;ignificant as &s;he is, has mortified titled harlots of this de|&s;cription.
One indeed &s;ent to know what &s;he had done,
that Mrs. Berkeley would not vi&s;it her; and Mrs. Berkeley
bade the lady tell her. Whether the lady did tell her or
not mu&s;t be gue&s;&s;ed. The wife of a gentleman may be|have
very fooli&s;hly, very idly; and it may, it mu&s;t, be
very difficult to a&s;certain whether her conduct is criminal
or not; and if her hu&s;band (not a known &s;coundrel) does
not give her up, her friends and neighbours ought not to
do it. But with Mary and Nan and the 'Squire, there can|not
remain a doubt, e&s;pecially when a poor little ba&s;e-born
brat appears, and is owned every year. It is the <HI>bounden</HI>
duty of <HI>every &s;incere</HI> &s;ervant of GOD to di&s;countenance vice;
let it be &s;eriou&s;ly remembered, that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Who

<P>In a country where the QUESTION, as the torture u&s;ed

commencement of their acquaintance, and to whom &s;he feels

Mr. Richard&s;on, the friend of Mrs. Epictetus Carter, the
relict of the abovenamed learned, well-informed Mr. Dun|combe,

Her letters, carefully pre&s;erved, if printed, would give the

<P>Few men, perhaps, have ever been formed with more
qualifications to make a complete orator than Mr. Berke|ley;
a very uncommonly harmonious mu&s;ical voice, with,
from an infant, the &s;weete&s;t tones imaginable, which he
could at plea&s;ure elevate, like his grandfather, Bi&s;hop
Berkeley, to <HI>tremendous</HI> thunder; taught, from four years old,
to repeat by heart, without rant or forced action, being
told, after he properly under&s;tood the meaning of what he
had learned, to repeat it as he felt it on his own mind;
and being, from &s;even years old, accu&s;tomed to talk with
delight of &s;peaking in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall; he took every op|portunity
of improving him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When a boy at Canterbury School, which, as has been
already ob&s;erved, he quitted at twelve years old, during
<PB N="ccvii" REF="219">
the &s;e&s;&s;ions for the city at the Guild-Hall, and for the
county at the old Ca&s;tle, Mr. Berkeley generally went
without his dinner, flying off the in&s;tant the &s;chool broke
up to the court, to hear the pleadings. He once prevailed
on his Father to permit him to go, attended by Mr.
Wright&s;on, under a &s;trict promi&s;e <Q REND="inline">"<HI>of doing every thing that
John bade him,</HI>"</Q> to Maid&s;tone, to attend at the a&s;&s;izes.
On his return home, he related all the cau&s;es and pleadings,
and a particular in the &s;umming up the evidence by Sir
William Black&s;tone, as accurately as if he had taken it all
down in &s;hort-hand, which he could not then do. He
was, if the French expre&s;&s;ion <HI>fort &eacute;veilli&eacute;</HI> may be per|mitted
to be tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, the mo&s;t <HI>awaked</HI> of all
creatures. <HI>Nothing</HI> e&s;caped him; he caught every thing he
&s;aw, and wi&s;hed to know, in a moment. One in&s;tance
proves it very &s;trongly. Soon after he went to Eton he
had a <HI>raging</HI> de&s;ire to learn to fence, which his Father was
<HI>re&s;olved</HI> he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> do, until he attained to a certain age,
fixed by him. All Mr. Berkeley's arguments that the Bi|&s;hop
had let his Father learn at fourteen were ineffectual;
Dr. Berkeley &s;aying, that many youths of fa&s;hion were
often killed by its &s;training their lungs when they were too
tender to bear it. Mr. Berkeley was, however, re&s;olved
to learn what he could, as he afterwards told his Father,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I had little trouble when <HI>I did</HI> learn; for I u&s;ed,
in&s;tead of going to cricket, &amp;c. to go regularly at the
hours of learning, and fix my&s;elf like a &s;tatue at the
<PB N="ccviii" REF="220">
window."</Q> Whil&s;t the very worthy, re&s;pectable, univer&s;ally
re&s;pected Mr. Angelo was in&s;tructing his pupils, he u&s;ed to
&s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I think I hardly came <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> by my &s;kill in fencing.
But Angelo is as worthy, amiable a man as ever lived;
and, I dare &s;ay, did not grudge me what I &s;o gleaned
from his great &s;kill."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley &s;poke his Prize Exerci&s;e in the Par|liament
Hall at St. Andrews, before the then Chancellor
of that Univer&s;ity, the late Earl of Kinnoul; when all
the prize exerci&s;es had been delivered, Lord Kinnoul went
to Mr. Berkeley, and, embracing him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I rejoice,
Sir, to embrace the grand&s;on of my dear old friend, Bi|&s;hop
Berkeley, and to be able to &s;ay, that <HI>I</HI> never heard
&s;peech <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;poken from this pulpit &s;ince I have had the
honour to be Chancellor here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley had redde
his prize exerci&s;e near fifty times over to his Mother. Ju&s;t
before he went out, he conjured her to hear him once
more, that he might lay his empha&s;is exactly right. The
reque&s;t was complied with.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, together with his amiable, beloved friend,
the late, learned Sir John Ram&s;ey, and his dear friend,
Mr. Lennard, frequently &s;pent part of their vacation very
plea&s;antly at Lord Kinnoul's &s;eat. A droll anecdote or two
might be here related, particularly a &s;cene in the Library;
but this Preface is already too long, and the reader has,
<PB N="ccix" REF="221">
perhaps, frequently exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What is all this chit-chat
to <HI>me?</HI> I wi&s;h to read the great actions of great men."</Q>
If &s;o, according to the advice of the <HI>great</HI> John&s;on, and the
<HI>little</HI> Editor, read Sir Francis Knollys's Hi&s;tory of the Turks,
Marcus Antoninus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion. It is impo&s;&s;ible to
omit an amiable attention of a young Scotch gentleman,
who, with his wonderfully &s;en&s;ible younger brother Tho|mas,
con&s;tantly attended the &s;ervice of the Church of
England at Dr. Berkeley's, and who were frequently invited
to vi&s;it there. The young Laird of Logie-Almon came
running into Mrs. Berkeley's dre&s;&s;ing-room quite breath|le&s;s;
he threw him&s;elf into a chair, and on Mrs. Berkeley's
enquiring if he was ill, and a&s;king whether he would have
any thing, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Madam; no. But
I flew hither to tell you how delightfully Mr. Berkeley

gentleman) &s;aid to me, I thought it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> delight you;

time barely fifteen years old. May he, as a man, through
life, be what he was in youth!</P>
<P>A very extraordinary circum&s;tance happened at the birth
of this young gentleman. A very aged dome&s;tic of the
Drummond family, many years more than an hundred,
who lived in a little cot (by the bounty of the excellent
Laird) on Logie-Almon e&s;tate, as &s;oon as he heard that his
dear Laird had a &s;on, walked down about a mile to get a
&s;ight of him. He was told the infant was a&s;leep. He re|turned
the next day. The Laird walked out; Lady Ca|tharine
feared letting the child be carried out of the room.
He returned the day but one following: the Laird <HI>at home,</HI>
ordered the infant down, to be viewed by worthy old
Steel; who, taking him into his arms, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Lord, now

<P>Tho&s;e medical gentlemen of &s;kill, who heard the above

&s;een the young Laird on the fir&s;t day when he went for
that purpo&s;e, the &s;pirit of the good old man had been freed
three days &s;ooner; that his ardent de&s;ire had detained it.
One has frequently heard of &s;imilar in&s;tances of the de|tention
of the &s;pirit in its earthly pri&s;on for hours, even
days. What a wonder is the &s;pirit of man! How pa&s;&s;ing
wonder HE who implants it in the curiou&s;ly wrought pri&s;on!
The late very &s;en&s;ible, unfortunate, Honourable Colonel
Nairne, a great collector, who had a fine print of old Steel,
<PB N="ccxii" REF="224">
which Mr. Monck Berkeley purcha&s;ed, with many other cu|rio&s;ities,
after his death, has frequently told the Editor, that
the engraver mi&s;took in &s;etting down his age, one hundred
and nine, that it ought to have been one hundred and
thirty-nine. One cannot help dropping a tear on the la|mentable
fate of this very accompli&s;hed, well-informed man.
His father, Lord Nairne, unfortunately engaged in the Re|bellion;
the &s;on fighting for the Hanover family. The
fir&s;t duty to which he was appointed, was to go and batter
down his own noble magnificent ca&s;tle. His late Maje&s;ty,
who knew him per&s;onally, was very de&s;irous to have given
him a regiment and other bounties; but the Duke of
Cumberland prevented it, by telling his Maje&s;ty it was
<HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> a man who had &s;uffered &s;o much could ever forget

honoured this little &s;eminary of <HI>juvenile</HI> orators with their

went on &s;peaking, without lo&s;ing <HI>any</HI> of his credit as an orator.
Two of the Scotch &s;peakers are now in England, the
learned, entertaining, Reverend Mr. James Bruce, Mr.
Berkeley's tutor, and the gentle, plea&s;ing Mr. William
Kemp, tutor to Mr. Lennard, who was many years ago
recommended, through Dr. Berkeley's recommendation, by
his amiable friend, the late Lord Dacre, into the family of
<PB N="ccxvi" REF="228">
the Earl of Beverley, where his uncommon merits as a tutor
are felt, and mo&s;t generou&s;ly, mo&s;t nobly rewarded, by
the noble de&s;cendant of the great hero of Chevy-Chace.</P>
<P>Soon after Mr. Berkeley's return to England he began to
feel an ardent de&s;ire to obtain a &s;eat in Parliament. How
was that wi&s;h to be gratified? Bi&s;hop Berkeley was too
generous to ama&s;s a fortune. He con&s;tantly gave away
with both hands. After thirty thou&s;and pounds debt paid
by Mr. Berkeley's grandmother, Mrs. Frin&s;ham, and her
&s;ingle &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Cherry, of their grandfather William
Cherry, E&s;quire, and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing,</HI> in&s;tead of taking, (as or|dered
by him if wanted to pay his debts,) a very good
e&s;tate left by him to found a charity &s;chool in the pari&s;h of
Bray in Berk&s;hire, where lay a large part of his va&s;t
e&s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be a plea&s;antry to &s;ay, that the burning of Cliefden's "<HI>Proud Alcove</HI>" fini&s;hed it; but, on that conflagration, the other day, went ten thou|&s;and pounds more of old Mr. Cherry's fortune; he having lent the Duke of Buckingham, commonly, ju&s;tly, called the wicked Duke of Buckingham, that &s;um to build that delightful man&s;ion. Mr. Berkeley's Mother and Aunt have a note of hand of the Duke for &s;even thou&s;and pounds. The Editor did not pro|duce it as any part of her fortune when &s;he married. The wonder was, that <HI>&s;o very acute</HI> a man as old Mr. Cherry certainly was, <HI>&s;hould lend to &s;uch</HI> a man as the Duke of Buckingham, &s;o large a &s;um, on only a common note of hand.&mdash;but Mr. Cherry was immen&s;ely rich, and lent to every one of his friends that a&s;ked him&mdash;accordingly his great-grand-daughter finds <HI>&s;ome</HI> of her kind friends much more ready to <HI>lend</HI> than <HI>&s;he is to borrow</HI>&mdash;for which may GOD reward them here and hereafter.</NOTE>. The South-Sea bubble had, although not beggared,
<PB N="ccxvii" REF="229">
yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of Mr. Cher|ry's
fortune; &s;o that, during the life of Mr. Berkeley's Mo|ther,
he could not get a qualification that would &s;it ea&s;y on
<HI>his</HI> con&s;cience. His Mother, on learning this, offered to give
up <HI>entirely</HI> into his hands her whole &s;ettlement, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I
have, from your infancy, ever &s;aid, 'If <HI>I mu&s;t be</HI> ab&s;o|lutely

has a genero&s;ity of &s;oul that <HI>I</HI> have never &s;een in any
human being, through my whole life, but in him&s;elf

curious cau&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall and the Old Bai|ley.

<P>Mr. Berkeley went perpetually to hear Ha&s;tings's Trial.
He told his Father, that <Q REND="inline">"after li&s;tening with all the atten|tion
he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of to the harangues of a certain

&s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertor of Mr. Ha&s;tings's innocence. He had
put him&s;elf to con&s;iderable expence to procure documents

an inve&s;tigation of Mr. Ha&s;tings's conduct and cha|racter,
as beautiful a defence as was ever penned, which
he, however, the day before it was to be &s;ent to the pre&s;s,

<PB N="ccxx" REF="232">
with many other things of Mr. Berkeley's writing; for he
was never idle but whil&s;t in company. When at his Fa|ther's,
he retired &s;oon after dinner, and immediately after
tea. As he very &s;eldom ate any &s;upper, as &s;oon as the
cloth was removed, his &s;ervant notified it to him, and
he came down and entertained his friends with his enliven|ing
conver&s;ation, and &s;ometimes delighted the &s;oul of his
Mother, by complying with her reque&s;t to &s;ing to her the

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Salvator Mundi,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be a&s;ked, why the Editor, who, as an old &s;ervant of her mother's once &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I don't know Latin from Engli&s;h,</HI>"</Q> knows not Latin, but had two kind tran&s;lators of it, and Mr. Berkeley's voice, when he &s;ang any thing &s;acred, was quite divine, very like Mr. Air&s;on's.

<P>Few per&s;ons were ever more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the
terror of being called into judgement for idlene&s;s than Mr.

frequently exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, forgive me; what an idle life
I do lead! Surely God will call me to account for it."</Q>
His Mother a&s;&s;ured him that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> did not re&s;emble Pharaoh's

<P>Mr. Berkeley's delicate attentions to his Mother's feel|ings
were throughly amiable. When he was about three and

The ble&s;&s;ings of being throughly in&s;tructed, well|grounded

de&s;cribed in a letter of the late Dr. Kenrick, Preben|dary
of We&s;tmin&s;ter, mini&s;ter of Hambledown, father of
the worthy Lady Gibbon. During Dr. Berkeley's re&s;idence
in Scotland Mr. Berkeley brought his Mother a very dirty
old Edinburgh magazine, with a leaf folded, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"My
dear Madam, there is a letter that will delight you."</Q> It
was from Dr. Kenrick (the year forgot) it de&s;erves to be
printed in letters of GOLD.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when &s;taying at his Father's hou&s;e in
Berk&s;hire, had books con&s;tantly from Bull's circulating li|brary
at Bath, or from Hookham's. His amiable &s;pirit
led him always to order, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the allowed number
&s;hould be &s;uch as would be plea&s;ant to his Mother. He
one day coming down into the drawing-room to tea, with

read it over again."</Q> This book was The CALVARY of
the excellent Mr. Cumberland, ju&s;t then publi&s;hed. Mr.
Berkeley &s;poke of it, <HI>as it merits to be &s;poken of,</HI> in all

to &s;ome lines which he termed pro&s;aic. At length
Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, it is po&s;&s;ible there may
be more piety than poetry in &s;ome of the lines; but I
think it was worth being born, if it were only to have

<P>A gentleman once &s;aid to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder Mr.

Mr. Berkeley, in conver&s;ation at the other end of the room,
overhearing it, broke off, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Sir, no; Mr.
Berkeley <HI>knows him&s;elf</HI> too <HI>well</HI> to be made vain. He
knows what he is equal to, and can never be <HI>fool</HI> enough

marked attention that was &s;hown to him by eminent men
of great learning or high rank, he con&s;tantly, humbly,
attributed to his being the grand&s;on of &s;o great a man as
Bi&s;hop Berkeley, who was extremely well known and highly

been either an <HI>angel</HI> or a <HI>fool</HI> not in&s;tantly to have ri&s;en
from table. They, however, contented them&s;elves with
never admitting his GRACE within their doors any more.
The late Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed frequently to relate this and
two or three other &s;tories, in order, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay to
Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"to call your Mother out."</Q> To be &s;ure,
Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed to <HI>&s;torm nobly</HI> on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to
the great diver&s;ion of her amiable hu&s;band, who u&s;ed to
a&s;k <Q REND="inline">"What would SHE have done had &s;he been Lady
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">?"</Q> To which &s;he u&s;ed to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Why never
have vi&s;ited any woman who admitted that BRUTE into
her drawing-room."</Q> An <HI>heavy</HI> puni&s;hment, to be &s;ure;
but the Editor, in&s;ignificant as &s;he is, has often mortified
<HI>fine</HI> ladies, even of rank, in that way. She began early.
About the age of twenty, &s;oon after the death of her ex|cellent
Mother, being with her younger &s;i&s;ter at a water|drinking
place, Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who had done <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the
favour to live with him five years previous to
her being married to him, came thither, was vi&s;ited by
every mortal; Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c. &amp;c.
yet all this availed her <HI>poor</HI> Lady&s;hip, with a &s;et of hor&s;es,
<PB N="ccxxix" REF="241">
two men cooks, of whom &s;he made <HI>frequent</HI> mention, and
about twenty thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> like Haman
with Mordecai. The&s;e two little in&s;ignificant country
gentleman's daughters <HI>would not</HI> vi&s;it her Lady&s;hip. They
were told, that it was <HI>ridiculous, not</HI> to do it. Some of
their relations, their &s;uperiors, told them that they <HI>ought</HI>
to do it. It availed not; they were as &s;tubborn as two
little mules. Well; but her Lady&s;hip would, <HI>willi nilhi,</HI>
con&s;tantly join the one who drank the waters every morn|ing,
and conver&s;e with her. She one morning &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"She
computed all her ill health to a bad lying-in."</Q> FAME
&s;aid, that her Lady&s;hip never had lain-in at all.</P>
<P>The Editor and her &s;i&s;ter always went to town every
&s;pring from Wind&s;or, where they re&s;ided before Mrs.
Berkeley married, for about two months or ten weeks, to
look about them, and prevent their being ru&s;ticated. At
Ranelagh, the Ridotto, &amp;c. her Lady&s;hip never failed to
find them out, come to them, and make the kinde&s;t en|quiries.
A woman of quality once, at an in&s;tallation at
Wind&s;or, &s;aid to Mrs. Berkeley, then Mi&s;s Frin&s;ham,
<Q REND="inline">"How comes it that <HI>you</HI> vi&s;it Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">?"</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Frin&s;ham.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I vi&s;it her! who told you that I vi&s;ited
her?"</Q></P>
<P>Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <Q REND="inline">"Nobody; but ju&s;t now &s;he happened to &s;ee
you, and &s;aid, 'Oh! there is Mi&s;s Frin&s;ham; <HI>I mu&s;t go,</HI>
<PB N="ccxxx" REF="242">
and &s;peak to her directly;' and away &s;he <HI>bu&s;tled.</HI> (Her
Lady&s;hip's gait was of that de&s;cription.) I thought, by
her manner, that you were very intimate."</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Frin&s;ham replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It was her own fault that &s;he
did not enjoy that <HI>honour.</HI>"</Q> The poor Lady is now
no longer an inhabitant of this world.</P>
<P>Such contempt may the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant pour on
VICE. It is not &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Stand by thy&s;elf; I am holier than
thou.</HI>"</Q> God avert &s;uch pride from every <HI>real</HI> child of God.
The Editor who, during a cour&s;e of forty years, has been
frequently in &s;uch &s;kirmi&s;hes, has been often a&s;ked <Q REND="inline">"If
they may not be <HI>very</HI> penitent;"</Q> to which her con&s;tant
reply is, the poet tells us, that
<Q>" 'Tis be&s;t repenting in a coach and &s;ix."</Q></P>
<P>But the Editor has no <HI>great</HI> idea of the hou&s;e-maid or the
kitchen-maid's repentance <HI>in</HI> the <HI>coach and &s;ix.</HI> Her peni|tents
are &s;uch as the late lovely Lady of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, who,
having tru&s;ted that mo&s;t agreeable of wretches <HI>too far,</HI> was
ruined, and he compelled by Authority to marry her. She
was, as country-folks in Berk&s;hire phra&s;e it, made an <HI>hone&s;t
woman.</HI> But the Editor has been repeatedly told by an inti|mate
excellent friend of hers, who con&s;tantly added, <Q REND="inline">"I had
probably &s;hared the &s;ame fate as Mi&s;s <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, if my excellent
Mother-in-law had not watched over me at eighteen, and

adding, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure, had my Mother been a&s;ked whether
&s;he would choo&s;e to leave me alone with <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> or
with a tiger, &s;he would not have he&s;itated to prefer
the tiger."</Q> How different are mothers <HI>now,</HI> in the&s;e en|lightened

of the &s;ly tiger kind, and &s;eldom laid wait for
his prey in vain. This excellent lady has often told the
Editor, that after Mi&s;s <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was married, no one ever
&s;aw that &s;he had an eye, for &s;he never lifted tho&s;e beau|teous
cau&s;es of her &s;ad fall, from the earth, &s;carce ever
&s;poke in company, but little to her mo&s;t intimate friends,
and died of grief at the end of two years. Happily her
worthy Son re&s;embles his Mother more than his Father.
This was repentance although in a coach and &s;ix, which
Mi&s;s <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s &s;ituation in life might entitle her to, for &s;he
was the daughter of a gentleman, and had a very good
fortune.</P>
<P>Some few years ago Dr. Berkeley, going to &s;pend &s;ome
months at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Mr. Monck Berkeley &s;aid to his Mo|ther,
<Q REND="inline">"Now, my dear Mother, as &s;oon as you get to
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;uch a lady (naming the name) will vi&s;it you,

and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> is a bold word for any body to u&s;e to your Mo|ther,
excepting it is your Father."</Q> He turned to his
Father, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;hed to hear my Mother's &s;entiments
of <HI>that</HI> Lady."</Q></P>
<P>It has been &s;aid before, that Mr. Berkeley could not re&s;t
if he &s;aw any creature in di&s;tre&s;s, from which it was po&s;&s;i|ble
for him to relieve him. In the year 1787, during the
long vacation, Mr. Berkeley, with two of his Temple friends,
J. R. Baker, E&s;quire, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and another, very
&s;en&s;ible, amiable, young gentleman, now no more, took a trip
to the continent. During their re&s;idence there, Mr. Berkeley
had it in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t, in a very awkward and unplea|&s;ant
&s;ituation, a very worthy amiable per&s;onage of very high
rank, his Serene Highne&s;s the then reigning Prince of Saxe
Gotha, uncle to the King of England. The circum&s;tances
attending this tran&s;action are too long to be related here.
In the ve&s;&s;el the Prince &s;aw and admired Mr. Berkeley's
wonderfully curious Highland dog of a very &s;carce breed, &s;o
much as to make Mr. Berkeley often regret that he could
not prevail upon him&s;elf to pre&s;ent him to his Serene High|ne&s;s;
but adding, <Q REND="inline">"My faithful companion &s;o many hun|dred
miles, in &s;o many different countries, I found I
could not part with OSCAR."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's hone&s;t
Scot, Richie, did the honours of O&s;car, told his &s;erene
Highne&s;s many wonderful, yet actually true, &s;tories of the
<PB N="ccxxxiii" REF="245">
&s;agacity, fidelity, <HI>prudence,</HI> of that lovely bea&s;t. On the
di&s;covery of the Duke's rank, poor Ritchie &s;aid to his
ma&s;ter, <Q REND="inline">"Laird, Sir, what an a &s;ad thing it is that I mu&s;t
lave ye!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Leave me, Ritchie! Why mu&s;t you
leave me? Have you got a better place, laddy?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no; but I can never go back to
England."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why not, Ritchie?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that elderly gentleman that talked
&s;o much to you is the King's uncle: Laird have mercy
upon me, and that ever <HI>I</HI> &s;hould not know it, and &s;hould
dare to talk to him &s;o about the dog&mdash;to be &s;ure, the
King will have me hanged if I go back to England. I
will &s;tay till you go, and then contrive, if I can, to &s;lip
into Scotland."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley an&s;wered for his Maje&s;ty; but &s;ome of Mr.
Berkeley's Engli&s;h friends, to divert them&s;elves, encouraged
poor Ritchie's fears. His Serene Highne&s;s at parting ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his gratitude for Mr. Berkeley's &s;ervices, and mo&s;t
conde&s;cendingly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I find, Sir, that you are a great
traveller. I hope, &s;ometime or other, that curio&s;ity (al|though
we have not much of curious) may lead you to
my Court, where I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy to return your
<PB N="ccxxxiv" REF="246">
wonderfully kind attentions to me by every re&s;pect in
my power."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed often to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Ritchie is a true Scot,
he will not own that he &s;ees (like the pumkins in the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The well-known &s;tory of the Engli&s;h gentleman's ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear tree&mdash;and the fooli&s;h vain Scot &s;aying he had &s;een the like <Q REND="inline">"in the Duke of Argyle's garden in Scotland."</Q> No per&s;on is ridiculous for <HI>unavoidable</HI> ignorance&mdash;every per&s;on, of every nation, for pretending to knowledge they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s.</NOTE> Duke of Argyle's garden) any thing of any kind better
in England than in Scotland."</Q> One day, when Mr.
Berkeley came down to dinner, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, Ritchie has at length vanqui&s;hed me, ju&s;t when I
plumed my&s;elf on victory. As he was dre&s;&s;ing my hair,
ju&s;t now, it occurred to me I will a&s;k Richie, if ever he
&s;aw a cru&s;ade in Scotland, and &s;ee if he will an&s;wer, O
yes, Sir, in the <HI>Loodons,</HI> i. e. the Lothians. I put the
que&s;tion, Ritchie, did you ever &s;ee a cru&s;ade?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Cru&s;ade, Sir? what an a thing is it? is it
any bea&s;ty?"</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> a bea&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No; it is a great number of people collected
together to go to Jeru&s;alem to recover it out of the hands
of the Infidels."</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O! yes, Sir; I have &s;een that in the Loo|dons
(his native county). When you were in Edinburgh
la&s;t, you gave me leave to vi&s;it my friends; and I heard
<PB N="ccxxxv" REF="247">
of them, and went to the wood where they were all
waiting to go to Jeru&s;alem."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley then recollected to have heard in Edin|burgh,
that there were a few deluded poor creatures who
had a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves in a wood, expecting to be con|veyed
through the air to the Holy Land. Their numbers
increa&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly afterwards, as was related, and a long
account was given of them in &s;ome Magazine, the Editor
thinks the Gentleman's. What became of the&s;e poor de|luded
&s;ouls &s;he does not recollect to have heard; but Mr.
Berkeley, laughing, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t now give it up as a gone
cau&s;e, the hope of finding out any thing Ritchie has not
&s;een in the Loodons."</Q></P>
<P>The PUBLICATOR, as mentioned before, very &s;oon found
out that he did not like the &s;ituation of his living. Poor
Dr. Berkeley was <HI>worried</HI> to be&s;iege good Archbi&s;hop Secker
to exchange it for another; one with a better hou&s;e, and
<HI>much</HI> better income, was &s;oon given to this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>particular,</HI>"</Q>
this GRATEFUL friend; where he commenced his ac|quaintance,
and, by the <HI>elegance</HI> of his manners, &s;oon
formed that <HI>intimacy</HI> with the pre&s;ent Sir Edward Dering,
Baronet, of Surrenden, which, for many months, afforded
&s;o much amu&s;ement in We&s;t Kent, and even in Ea&s;t Kent.
His contentions with that gentleman, concerning game,
could not be that he might &s;end &s;ome to his friend, Dr.
<PB N="ccxxxvi" REF="248">
Berkeley; for he never, in his whole life, &s;ent him even a
lark.</P>
<P>Some time after the PUBLICATOR had been gratified
by the exchange of his living, Dr. Berkeley went, as he
frequently did, to make a vi&s;it of &s;ome weeks at Lambeth.
The fir&s;t day at dinner his Grace acco&s;ted him thus: <Q REND="inline">"Dr.
Berkeley, I HEAR that your friend Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> has
been in town for about a fortnight. <HI>I hear</HI> it, for I can|not
&s;ay <HI>I &s;aw</HI> him. He did not find his way to Lam|beth."</Q>
Poor Dr. Berkeley &s;at aba&s;hed at, as he termed it,
the brutal folly, to &s;ay nothing of the <HI>ingratitude,</HI> of this
<HI>particular</HI> friend, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"I hope that your Grace
mu&s;t have been mi&s;informed."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, my good young
gentleman, I have not been mi&s;informed;" (then
quickening his voice, as he frequently did;) "for he was
&s;een driving over We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge in a hackney-coach,"
(the <HI>Publicator</HI> had not <HI>then</HI> a carriage of his own;) "and,"
(quickening his voice &s;till more) "in <HI>many</HI> other parts
of the town."</Q> To this no an&s;wer could <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> be made.
A <HI>mourne &s;ilence</HI> followed, until broken by that lovelie&s;t
of women, the angelic, the incomparable Mi&s;s Talbot, who,
to relieve her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friend, introduced &s;ome <HI>plea&s;anter</HI>
&s;ubject, than the marvellous (as Dr. Berkeley termed
it) conduct of the <HI>particular</HI> friend. Dr. Berkeley, at
his return home, appeared extemely chagrined on re|lating
it.</P>
<P><PB N="ccxxxvii" REF="249">
Some time after, on taxing the <HI>Publicator</HI> with his un|accountably &s;trange conduct, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf very <HI>cle|verly,</HI>
by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, I believe I &s;hould have gone, but
I had not time; for, to tell you the truth, <HI>I</HI> went to
London (always to a friend's hou&s;e) to &s;hew <HI>Beely</HI> and
<HI>Peggy</HI> the wax-work, and the monuments, and the lions,
and every thing."</Q> It was very lucky that it did not occur
to him to carry <HI>Beely</HI> and <HI>Peggy</HI> to <HI>dinner</HI> with his Grace on
a <HI>public</HI> day, and &s;hew them the Lollards Tower there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Publicator</HI> &s;eems to have taken pains to tack at the
very end of the li&s;t of Bi&s;hop Horne's friend's Dr. (then
George Berkeley, E&s;quire)&mdash;a <HI>real</HI> E&s;quire, from his poor,
<HI>unknown</HI> Father's rank in life, and expending every year at
Oxford, as he has repeatedly told the Editor,&mdash;not in vice,
She is &s;ure, as his excellent Father &s;aid, when, on his arrival
in Oxford, Dr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am a&s;hamed, my Lord, to
&s;ay that I have &s;pent &s;ix hundred pounds in four months&mdash;here
is the account."</Q> The Bi&s;hop made the above generous
reply, <Q REND="inline">"Not in vice, I am &s;ure, child,"</Q> and threw the account
into the fire. It was great part in virtue. A &s;ervant to wait on
him&s;elf, and a groom for his hor&s;es, could not be reckoned
extravagant. A young man, who never ta&s;ted wine, could
not &s;pend more than a thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> but,
having never been, according to his Son, <HI>buffeted</HI> through a
public &s;chool, and being quite unacquainted with charac|ters,
he was perpetually impo&s;ed on by de&s;igning, ungrate|ful,
<PB N="ccxxxviii" REF="250">
young men, to whom he was <HI>too</HI> bountiful, as appears
by his accounts, now in the Editor's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, from the
day he arrived at Chri&s;t Church. He is receiving his re|ward;
<HI>they,</HI> no doubt, <HI>will</HI> receive theirs. Much went in
charity to real, frequently unknown, objects.</P>
<P>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley &s;ay, that
one morning at Chri&s;t Church, his &s;ervant &s;having him,
he redde a &s;ermon preached on charity for lying-in women
in Alder&s;gate-Street. The preacher, the Editor thinks a Pre|late,
de&s;cribed the mi&s;eries of <HI>poor</HI> women in tho&s;e circum|&s;tances
&s;o pathetically, that Dr. Berkeley &s;aid <Q REND="inline">"I, a young
man, had never thought on. I felt it &s;o &s;trongly, that,
with one half of my chin un&s;haved, I made my &s;ervant
lay down the razor, catched up a &s;heet of paper, wrote to
my banker an order to pay to the trea&s;ure of the ho&s;pital
fifty pounds, to make me a governor for life, for fear I
&s;hould be at any time unwilling to pay the annual &s;ub|&s;cription."</Q></P>
<P>Some Scotch friend, the Editor has not been able to di&s;|di&s;cover
who has celebrated Dr. Berkeley's charities to the
poor, during his <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> with his Son at the Univer&s;ity of St.
Andrew's, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that he every year gave away above
two hundred pounds with his own hands."</Q> This is a
mi&s;take. He very &s;eldom did give with his own elegant
hands, unle&s;s his wife's may be called his own; for unle&s;s,
<PB N="ccxxxix" REF="251">
which was frequently the ca&s;e, he inclo&s;ed in a blank cover
a ten, often a twenty pound bank note, to any per&s;on, una|ble
to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> though not to <HI>receive</HI> charity, who&s;e face he had
never &s;een, only heard from good authority of their di&s;tre&s;s.
How often has he thus <Q REND="inline">"<HI>made the widow's heart to &s;ing for
joy,</HI>"</Q> and with holy Job <Q REND="inline">"the ble&s;&s;ing of him that was
ready to peri&s;h came upon him."</Q> In other in&s;tances,
with regard to the &s;urrounding poor, he always left the
plea&s;ing ta&s;k on Mrs. Berkeley; con&s;tantly &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I
never trouble my&s;elf; my wife is my almoner;"</Q> adding,
as Mrs. Berkeley once &s;aid to her excellent kind friend Dr.
Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, on his a&s;king her con|cerning
a poor old man, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> know nothing of him; when

<HI>any more</HI> about them, but &s;earch out &s;ome new objects,
well knowing that <HI>they</HI> will have ample abundant care
taken of <HI>them.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>A Scotch mini&s;ter was once celebrating to Mrs. Berkeley
the <HI>va&s;t</HI> charities of the LATE Earl of Lauderdale&mdash;a very
worthy Nobleman HE was. He began by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"His cha|rities
are <HI>amazingly great</HI> indeed. As &s;urely as you &s;it
there, Madam, that man puts a <HI>guinea</HI> into the plate, (a

<PB N="ccxl" REF="252">
every Sabbath day, and every year three guineas at the

<P>Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Lauderdale has, I know,

father to our equally charitable, amiable amba&s;&s;a|dor
at Turin, Sir William Lynch. The Dean had a
large paternal e&s;tate, married one of the daughters of

The Editor has had occa&s;ion to remark that the PUBLI|CATOR
was not very forward to make any grateful return
for any favour be&s;towed on him; for he never pre&s;ented
his friend Dr. Berkeley even with a lark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. ccxxxvi.</NOTE>. It is com|monly
&s;aid, that in the county of Berks during the partridge
&s;ea&s;on there are as many guns as birds; therefore game is
always a mo&s;t agreeable pre&s;ent, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who
keep much company; and frequently, in their &s;everal &s;ea|&s;ons,
would arrive hares, partridges, phea&s;ants, &amp;c. from
the very grateful Mr. Andrews, of Marden in Kent. He
never &s;uffered any neighbour to go to London without re|que&s;ting
him to take &s;ome game, and &s;end it down by the
Maidenhead coach. The year that Archbi&s;hop Secker
pre&s;ented Mr. Andrews to this living, apples &s;ailed in every
county of England except Kent; which is no great wonder,
&s;ince the farmers of that county pay mo&s;t careful attention
to their trees in winter, clearing them of all dead wood,
mo&s;s, &amp;c. Mr. Andrews packed up his whole crop of
apples in hampers, and &s;ent them all, except a <HI>very few</HI>
&s;tinted ones. Apples that year were &s;uch rarities, that
Mrs. Berkeley &s;ugge&s;ted to Dr. Berkeley to &s;end them to
Lambeth Palace; which was &s;peedily done, a few only be|ing
re&s;erved as curio&s;ities; and a mo&s;t acceptable offering
they proved. Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley going to make &s;ome
&s;tay at Lambeth Palace &s;oon after, the fir&s;t day after din|ner
from &s;ome apples being on the table, the Archbi&s;hop, with
<PB N="ccxliii" REF="255">
his wonted politene&s;s, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Lady and Gentleman, will
you not eat &s;ome of your <HI>own</HI> fine apples? How came it
to pa&s;s that <HI>your</HI> trees produced this wonderfully &s;carce
year?"</Q> To which Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my
good Lord, we had not a &s;core on all our trees. They
are the grateful offering of a very grateful man, Mr.
Andrews; and my wife thought that, as <HI>we</HI> owed the
apples to your Grace's goodne&s;s to him, they ought, in
<HI>con&s;cience,</HI> to be &s;ent to your Grace:"</Q> who, with his ac|cu&s;tomed
plea&s;antry, turning to Mrs. Berkeley, who had
the honour to be a great favourite with his Grace, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, my good young lady, I don't know that I ought
to accept <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e apples.</HI> I am afraid they are a <HI>little &s;imo|niacal.</HI>"</Q>
To which Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! no,
my Lord: if they had come <HI>before</HI> your Grace had
preferred Mr. Andrews, it might have been a ca&s;e for
Bi&s;hop Taylor's <HI>Ductor Dubitantium;</HI> but, I think, as it
is, your Grace may eat them with a <HI>very &s;afe con&s;cience.</HI>"</Q>
His Grace laughed heartily, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I remember Arch
bi&s;hop Potter u&s;ed to tell of a man whom he had given
a &s;mall living, on which grew a remarkably fine pear|tree.
He u&s;ed every year to &s;end the pears to Lambeth.
His Grace gave him a &s;econd, much better, living; and
he u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'Whether the pear-tree <HI>died,</HI> or the pears
were <HI>blighted every year,</HI> I know not; but I know that I
<HI>never &s;aw another pear</HI> after I gave the <HI>&s;econd</HI> living."</Q> This
GRATEFUL man did not, probably, like the PUBLICATOR,
<PB N="ccxliv" REF="256">
expect one of the <HI>three</HI> &s;talls at Canterbury. He was at
lea&s;t <HI>mode&s;t,</HI> if ungrateful.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to avoid contra&s;ting two men, both of
whom were indebted for their fir&s;t comfortable e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
in life to the exqui&s;ite amiability of Dr. Berkeley
the Reverend Dr. Gla&s;&s;e and the PUBLICATOR. When
Mr. Monck Berkeley was about &s;ix or &s;even years old, Dr.
Gla&s;&s;e &s;aid, more than once, <Q REND="inline">"If you and Mrs. Berkeley
would confide your little man to me, how happy &s;hould
I be! what care and attention I would pay him! and I
am &s;ure, if you would conde&s;cend to <HI>accept</HI> it, I de&s;ire
neither fee nor reward."</Q> The la&s;t grateful offer was of
cour&s;e thankfully declined; and from Mr. Berkeley's birth
his Father determined, that, if God &s;pared his life, he
&s;hould be educated at a Public School; often lamenting
that the good Bi&s;hop had not &s;ent <HI>him</HI> to one, particularly
after his &s;on grew up, often &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"he had then got a
&s;econd guardian."</Q> Bi&s;hop Berkeley, at one time, for &s;e|veral
years paid four hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to different
ma&s;ters to in&s;truct his children in Mu&s;ic, Painting, Fencing,
Riding, and French; the Latin and Greek he entru&s;ted to
none but him&s;elf. His &s;ons were never &s;uffered either to
ride or walk out unattended by a careful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>When Dr. Berkeley came to Oxford, at the age of nine|teen,
attended by a mo&s;t re&s;pectable worthy Chaplain of
<PB N="ccxlv" REF="257">
his Father's, and his own &s;ervant, he had never rode a mile
alone; and he had contracted an habit of meditating and
compo&s;ing on hor&s;eback, which occa&s;ioned his being the
mo&s;t carele&s;s of riders, leaving the hor&s;e's bridle &s;o very
loo&s;e, that he was perpetually thrown. Soon after his
marriage, Mrs. Berkeley, finding this to be the ca&s;e, made
it a point that he never &s;hould ride without a &s;ervant.
When Mr. Berkeley grew up, he joined in what Dr. Berke|ley
called his Mother's <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> and one day &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What
is the rea&s;on, I would fain know, why your Mother lets
you ride fifty miles without a &s;ervant, and over hedge
and ditch, nobody knows where, hunting, and won't let
me ride to Taplow or Maidenhead alone?"</Q> To which
Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, if <HI>you</HI> had been
<HI>buffeted</HI> for &s;even years though Eton School, <HI>I dare &s;ay, my</HI>
Mother would have let you ride alone as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley con&s;tantly hunted with buck-hounds twice a week&mdash;frequently with Mr. Clayton's hounds. It was not <HI>&s;o quietly</HI> as Mr. Monck Berkeley &s;up|po&s;ed; for Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, on hunting days, <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> prays the whole morning&mdash;let me go into the dre&s;&s;ing-room ever &s;o often, I am &s;ure to hear&mdash;"Berkeley is not come home&mdash;GOD watch over him, and &s;end him &s;afe." The&s;e ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon. They were certainly heard by HIM who heareth prayer, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, an&s;wered; for Mr. Berkeley never once got a fall in hunting&mdash;he rode remarkably well."</Q> He never would cro&s;s his Maje&s;ty in the cha&s;e. He u&s;ed frequently to expre&s;s indignation at a hunting butcher, particularly well mounted, who u&s;ed to cro&s;s &s;o as &s;ometimes to endanger his Maje&s;ty; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"What can the fellow be made of, to be &s;uch a &s;avage?"</Q> to which Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Why, of bulls hides, to be &s;ure."</Q></NOTE> quietly as &s;he
<PB N="ccxlvi" REF="258">
does me; but that is out of the que&s;tion, for ride alone
you mu&s;t not; that is agreed on all hands."</Q> To which
Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;ure, you are obliged to <HI>me,</HI>
Sir. I wi&s;h I had been buffeted <HI>any where</HI> in my youth,
as you have been, you rogue."</Q></P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion to the contra&s;t of, as
Mrs. George Berkeley ever termed him, the really grateful
Dr. Gla&s;&s;e. We have &s;een his kind offer, in the preceding
page; we will now proceed to the PUBLICATOR's polite re|fu&s;al.
When Archbi&s;hop Cornwallis vi&s;ited at Canterbury,
he was of cour&s;e at the Deanery. It was impo&s;&s;ible that
the attendant Bi&s;hop &s;hould be al&s;o lodged there. On a
con&s;ultation concerning the place where he &s;hould be re|ceived
and entertained, not one of the Prebendaries &s;eemed
de&s;irous of that honour. The generous ho&s;pitable Dr.
Lynch was not then a member of the choir; and it mu&s;t in
ju&s;tice be &s;aid, that numbers of the Prebendaries, who are
not in office, let their prebendal hou&s;es, and are only vi&s;itors
or boarders to their tenants; &s;o they have it not in their
power to receive any one. It was &s;ugge&s;ted that the Pre|late
mu&s;t be contented to go to one of the mi&s;erably bad,
exce&s;&s;ively dear, inns in the city. This &s;hocked Dr.
Berkeley, although only the &s;on of a poor UNKNOWN Iri&s;h
Prelate; and he in&s;tantly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Bad as my hou&s;e is, it is
better than a na&s;ty dirty inn; he &s;hall be my gue&s;t."</Q> As
&s;oon as it was known who the attending Bi&s;hop was, Dr.
<PB N="ccxlvii" REF="259">
Berkeley wrote a polite letter, reque&s;ting the honour of
having his Lord&s;hip for his gue&s;t. Mrs. Berkeley reque&s;ted
her amiable con&s;ort to permit her to invite his lady, with
whom &s;he had the honour to be acquainted, and who&s;e
lovely elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, &s;weet, beautiful Mi&s;s Maddox, was a
beloved friend of her childhood. Bi&s;hop Maddox, when a
Wel&s;h bi&s;hop, had for &s;everal &s;ummers a hou&s;e at Ea&s;t
Burnham, in the neighbourhood of White Waltham. That
lovely creature died early. The Editor cheri&s;hes, with
tender care, a keep&s;ake, a &s;mall &s;ilver medal, given by the
good Bi&s;hop to his &s;weet daughter, to pre&s;ent to her little
friend.</P>
<P>Some days before the arrival of the Archbi&s;hop, &amp;c.
Dr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"the children (then both living at home
and going to Dr. Beauvoir's &s;chool) will be horridly in
the &s;ervants' way, for we mu&s;t keep open hou&s;e for a
fortnight. What can we do with them?"</Q> Mrs. Berke|ley
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"She would contrive it as well as &s;he could: they
&s;hould get a cold dinner at one, and be off to play di|rectly."</Q>
Mrs. Frin&s;ham, then at Dr. Berkeley's, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"You know I am going to Ram&s;gate, and I will take <HI>one.</HI>"</Q>
It was Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"You are very kind; you
&s;hall take Robert: and it has ju&s;t occurred to me that
I will &s;end Berkeley to *****; HE will be glad of an
opportunity of obliging ME."</Q> Dr. Berkeley was, alas!
ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable &s;elf. De|lighted
<PB N="ccxlviii" REF="260">
with this idea, he wrote to the PUBLICATOR,
&s;tating his &s;ituation, and &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"On &s;uch a day John will
deliver into your care my elde&s;t boy for a fortnight; at
the expiration of which I &s;hall fetch him home."</Q> By
the return of the po&s;t, Dr. Berkeley received a letter from
the PUBLICATOR, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that he was very &s;orry that it
&s;o happened that he could not po&s;&s;ibly receive his little
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor &s;pelt, but always &s;o pronounced, by the <HI>elegant</HI> Publicator, when &s;peaking of the young gentlemen his boarders&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My bouys"</Q>&mdash;or of his own &s;on, who was a remarkably elegant lad. The Editor has not &s;een him &s;ince he was a very plea&s;ing youth, when &s;he advi&s;ed his father, in return for the Latin and Greek he taught his &s;on, to make him teach him a little politene&s;s. Dr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Nobody flatters ***** like <HI>my wife;</HI>"</Q> on which Mrs. Berkeley fired, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> flatter him! how can you &s;ay &s;o?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nay, I will prove it; for, whenever he is here, you won't &s;uffer any body el&s;e to &s;peak; but &s;ay, do pray hold you tongueS, that <HI>I</HI> may hear what ***** &s;ays,"</Q> about Botany, Farming, &amp;c. in which he is well &s;killed.</NOTE><HI>bouy;</HI> but that he had ju&s;t &s;ettled all matters to take his
pupils to the &s;ea, to &s;hew them the &s;hipping, and give
them a week's plea&s;ure;&mdash;it was unlucky, but it could
not be helped."</Q> Dr. Berkeley flew with this letter to
Mrs. Berkeley, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Well, this is the luckie&s;t thing
in the world;"</Q> then redde the epi&s;tle; ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline">"it
will make Berkeley" (ju&s;t then turned of eleven years
old, and, as an excellent judge u&s;ed to &s;ay, "the be&s;t-bred
properly behaved child of that age in England; no af|fected
manly airs, but a &s;weetly polite lad") "as happy
as a prince, poor fellow."</Q> Dr. Berkeley notified this
by letter immediately to the PUBLICATOR, who <HI>in&s;tantly</HI>
<PB N="ccxlix" REF="261">
returned the following <HI>elegant, grateful,</HI> an&s;wer. The let|ter
is carefully pre&s;erved. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Friend, (his con&s;tant
familiar addre&s;s to Dr. Berkeley,) <HI>I cannot</HI> help thinking
<HI>you very unrea&s;onable,</HI> in wanting to fa&s;ten your Son upon
<HI>me,</HI> e&s;pecially at a time when I have told you, that
<HI>I cannot</HI> take him."</Q> The letter goes on in the &s;ame <HI>ele|gant</HI>
&s;tyle. Poor Dr. Berkeley was, for the time, <HI>very, very</HI>
angry indeed; and Mrs. Berkeley <HI>maliciou&s;ly</HI> laughed at the
<HI>gratitude</HI> of his <HI>dear Friend.</HI> After &s;ome time, Dr. Berkeley
wrote a letter to the Publicator; and, as was frequently
his cu&s;tom, when going out to dinner, pa&s;&s;ing from his
&s;tudy, threw half a dozen letters on the table in Mrs.
Berkeley's dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I am in ha&s;te; I &s;hall
be di&s;tanced; pray &s;eal the&s;e un&s;ealed ones; and &s;end
them all; with, yours, to po&s;t."</Q> The letter to the <HI>grate|ful</HI>
Friend was &s;afely &s;ealed; and Mrs. Berkeley, having
very little of our grandmother Eve's curio&s;ity in her com|po&s;ition,
did not a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to read it; but, hollowing
it up, &s;he, with a good pen, wrote, as plainly as &s;he could
contrive to do, the little word <HI>gratitude.</HI> Off went the letter
to the po&s;t. In a few days Dr. Berkeley, coming into the
drawing-room to tea, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have got a letter from
*****, in which he &s;eems much di&s;quieted. He a&s;ks
what could po&s;&s;ibly induce &s;ome member of my family to
write on the edge of the in&s;ide of the letter I la&s;t wrote to
him the word <HI>gratitude.</HI> My dear, do you know any thing
about it?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, from her cradle, to (&s;he
<PB N="ccl" REF="262">
tru&s;ts) her coffin, too proud to tell a lie, in&s;tantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure I do; for <HI>I</HI> wrote it."</Q>&mdash;Dr. Berkeley &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Why would you write?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e <HI>I</HI> think it a <HI>mighty
pretty word.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your wrath again&s;t *****, like mo&s;t
violent blazes, has abated."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor cannot di&s;mi&s;s the PUBLICATOR without re|marking,
that, had it plea&s;ed the Divine Goodne&s;s to have
&s;pared Dr. Berkeley to have &s;een the contempt <HI>endeavoured</HI>
to be thrown on his very deeply-learned, ju&s;tly, univer&s;ally
admired Father, his indignation would <HI>not</HI> have &s;ub&s;ided,
as it for &s;ome time did, on account of his little Son. Dr.
Berkeley never did, never would, forgive a greater man
than even the Publicator, for &s;peaking, as he thought, im|properly
again&s;t his excellent Father; for which great man and
his incomparable writings he had through life the greate&s;t
re&s;pect, <Q REND="inline">"RAMBLER John,"</Q> as Dr. Berkeley, who generally
redde a Rambler once a week, termed that great man.
His Son always called him the noble learned Bear. The
accident happening at Oxford was too well known then,
too well remembered by many gentlemen then pre&s;ent,
&s;till living, to be here detailed. Suffice it therefore to &s;ay,
that John&s;on's want of <HI>le &s;avoir vivre</HI> occa&s;ioned his ridi|culing
Bi&s;hop Berkeley's American &s;cheme, by which he
meant to introduce Epi&s;copacy there, always declaring, <Q REND="inline">"if
it was not done in a few years, the Colonies would revolt
from the Mother Country."</Q> The event has &s;hown that this
<PB N="ccli" REF="263">
<HI>unknown</HI> Prelate was not a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Prophet. What the Father
could not accompli&s;h, the Son contrived to bring about, by
his intere&s;t with the Scotch Bi&s;hops; the very excellent,
very deeply learned Bi&s;hop Skinner; the very pious Bi&s;hop
Falconer, who died &s;oon after; and the amiable worthy
Sir John Strachan, Baronet; as now that he is no more
may be <HI>publicly</HI> known. In a letter to a Friend, written
&s;ome time after, Dr. Berkeley &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I was well aware that
it would <HI>never</HI> be forgiven, but I rejoice that I have
done it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley &s;elt his amiable heart gratified in rendering
every po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice in his power to the repeal of Lord
Hardwicke's horrid act after the Rebellion in 1745. Had
Dr. Berkeley's advice been adhered to, the fir&s;t attempt
had &s;ucceeded, when the three Scotch Prelates came over
the fir&s;t time to &s;olicit it; but in mo&s;t tran&s;actions there is
generally a Marplot. Dr. Berkeley was particularly happy
in entertaining at his hou&s;e in Berk&s;hire, and endeavouring
to return the very polite ho&s;pitality of Sir John Strachan
to him&s;elf and family at Dundee, and of Bi&s;hop Skinner to
his Son when at Aberdeen, where Mr. Monck Berkeley had
the freedom of the city pre&s;ented to him, as he had of &s;e|veral
other cities and towns in Scotland, and a licence pre|&s;ented
to &s;hoot on very manor wherever he went. He
&s;pent near a fortnight at Taymouth mo&s;t agreeably. The
Editor fears to tru&s;t her once retentive, now, alas! trea|cherous
<PB N="cclii" REF="264">
memory, to &s;ay, of &s;ixteen gentlemen who &s;at down
to dinner, every day, how many were John Campbell. This
came out accidentally. Some one, not knowing Mr. Berke|ley's
partiality for Scotland, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How ridiculous they
are, calling them&s;elves by the names of their e&s;tates!"</Q>
Mr. Berkeley reddened, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, why &s;o?
how would you have them di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, by their Chri&s;tian names, as we do."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That
will not do, Sir. The mode of di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;everal
brothers in a public &s;chool, <HI>major, minor,</HI> &amp;c. will not
do; nor will <HI>fir&s;t, &s;econd, third,</HI> do."</Q> He then men|tioned
as above related. The worthy learned Laird of Aha|ladar
(certainly not &s;pelt right by the Editor, although &s;o
pronounced) and his accompli&s;hed, amiable, elde&s;t &s;on,
both much beloved by Mr. Berkeley were two of near half
a &s;core John Campbells. Mr. Berkeley retained a mo&s;t
grateful &s;en&s;e of the kind, elegant ho&s;pitality at Ahaladar.
Talking frequently, after his return from College, of Jack
Ahaladar, his brother a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"Who is Jack Ahaladar, of
whom you talk &s;o much?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, the <HI>young</HI> Laird, a
charming young man&mdash;YOU would like <HI>him.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Probably
now the elegant Laird of Ahaladar, as the Editor thinks &s;he
was told the worthy old Laird is dead. He pre&s;ented Mr.
Berkeley with a very curious original letter, which, when
the Editor can afford to print the &s;econd volume of Literary
Relics, will be publi&s;hed in it.</P>
<P><PB N="ccliii" REF="265">
To return from this digre&s;&s;ion. Dr. John&s;on had no
&s;ooner fini&s;hed his rude &s;entence, than Dr. (then Mr.) Berke|ley,
then a little turned of twenty, ro&s;e from his &s;eat,
reached his cap, made his bow, and, to the no &s;mall
di&s;tre&s;s of the gentleman who had invited him to meet
Dr. John&s;on, quitted the room in great indignation before
&s;upper. On &s;ome of the company, intimates of Dr. John|&s;on,
reproaching him for his <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> conduct, HE made a &s;ort
of <HI>amende honorable,</HI> by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I think the Bi&s;hop's

Berkeley was exqui&s;itely well-bred, not at all in&s;olent; to
which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, not at all, but I thought it might
do him good to mortify him <HI>a little.</HI>"</Q> Dr. John&s;on wi&s;hed to
have written the Bi&s;hop's life; but Dr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he would
not furni&s;h him with any documents;"</Q> which Mr. Monck
Berkeley u&s;ed exceedingly to regret, &s;aying to his Father,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, it will never be &s;o written as John&s;on would
have written it;"</Q> to which Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to reply,
<Q REND="inline">"It may be &s;o; but I was re&s;olved HE &s;hould not write it.
You may, if you plea&s;e."</Q> Dr. John&s;on, through a com|mon
friend, made many attempts to vi&s;it Dr. Berkeley in
Berk&s;hire, and once &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I have a good mind to go down
to Cookham, and &s;ee what they would &s;ay to me."</Q> Mrs.
Berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"We &s;hould be very happy to &s;ee him;"</Q> but his reply was
<PB N="ccliv" REF="266">
<Q REND="inline">"No; the man that could &s;peak &s;lightingly of my great

It is therefore probable, that this re&s;pectful mention of
Bi&s;hop Berkeley by the PUBLICATOR would have completed
the bu&s;ine&s;s begun by the &s;mothering of the Con&s;ecration
Sermon for four years.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley pre&s;erved all the letters he received, except
now and then one, which he flung into the fire before he
appeared to have redde it through; and, like his Father and
Dean Swift, &s;ome he never opened at all, but threw them
into a drawer. After his lamented death, the Editor found
a baker's dozen (fourteen) from a fleecing Ingrate, with
the &s;eal unbroken, as &s;he told the man when obliged to
hold a &s;hort conver&s;ation with him. It has been often &s;aid
of the Editor's grandfather, the celebrated Francis Cherry,
E&s;quire, that he met with more Ingrates than any other man
ever did. I &s;uppo&s;e of mo&s;t per&s;ons of very large fortunes
and very liberal minds, it may, with equal truth, be a&s;|&s;erted.
Dr. Berkeley's fortune was by no means large, but
his <HI>&s;oul</HI> was noble. He, by his wi&s;e advice and direction,
made the fortunes of great numbers. Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed
often to &s;ay to him, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, you can make the
fortune of every one you take in hand, but your|&s;elf
and your Son, and you will not &s;tir a &s;troke for
<HI>him.</HI>"</Q> His reply con&s;tantly was, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot help it.
I cannot a&s;k or pu&s;h for my&s;elf or for him. If others do
<PB N="cclv" REF="267">
not, it mu&s;t remain undone by me."</Q> Both are now hap|pily
provided for by <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that Friend who &s;ticketh clo&s;er than a
brother;</HI>"</Q> both are receiving the reward of their labour of
love to real friends and ba&s;e ingrates, whom may God, for
Chri&s;t's &s;ake, forgive, prays the Editor.</P>

Some days before Archbi&s;hop Cornwallis's arrival at Can|terbury,

&s;he had prepared a bed for him, and that the utmo&s;t care
&s;hould be taken of him."</Q> THAT no one in the county of
Kent could doubt, where her fame, as well as in many
other counties, was, as it ju&s;tly merited, blazed abroad.</P>
<P>A young gentleman of large fortune at Canterbury
School, the amiable Richard Tilden, E&s;quire, who boarded
at the &s;econd ma&s;ter's, Mr. Tucker's, was nur&s;ed by Mrs.
Tucker through a dreadful fever. Mrs. Tucker, although
then lying-in, cau&s;ed his bed to be removed into her own
chamber, that <HI>&s;he</HI> might <HI>&s;ee</HI> he got his medicines at the
appointed hours. As &s;oon as &s;ufficiently recovered, he was
conveyed home, where he had not been many days, when
he reque&s;ted his Mother (he was an orphan) to order the
coach to carry him back to Mrs. Tucker, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that he
liked <HI>her</HI> nur&s;ing better than home nur&s;ing;"</Q> and the
reque&s;t was complied with. This happened before the
Editor was re&s;ident at Canterbury, but has been frequently
<PB N="cclx" REF="272">
related to her by her very &s;en&s;ible worthy friend, the late
Lady Head, and by many other per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Mr. Tilden was a <HI>more</HI> than father to the Editor's younge&s;t
Son, of whom he was &s;o very fond, and to whom he was &s;o

<HI>unaffected</HI> &s;weetne&s;s of Mrs. Tucker, (the Editor allows <HI>unaf|fected</HI>

&s;weetne&s;s into her <HI>own</HI> children, but into <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of her
boarders, generally &s;ons of the fir&s;t gentlemen in the county,
often from other counties.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance of an amiably <HI>retentive</HI> grateful mind is
now to be adduced from <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e boarders. The Edi|tor
received the account from &s;uch authority as precludes

That very learned, worthy, careful, now private,

negligent of them, the hou&s;ekeeper amu&s;ed her&s;elf with feed|ing
a parcel of Guinea fowls, in general very wild birds. The&s;e
creatures, although never fed but once a day, u&s;ed to run
flocking around her every time &s;he went into the meadows
<PB N="cclxii" REF="274">
where they wandered; and more than one Sunday it was
with con&s;iderable difficulty that &s;he got into the church
without near forty of her feathered friends e&s;corting her.
She had reared near thirty of them, difficult as the ta&s;k is,
the hens being very bad nur&s;es. They well knew the hour
of feeding was pa&s;t. It was <HI>gratitude;</HI> &s;hame to human
nature! which the famous Dr. Cheyne u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"was
<HI>without</HI> GOD'S GRACE, a compound of Brute and Devil;"</Q>
but the&s;e poor quadrupeds and winged fowl have not God's
grace, and yet <HI>they</HI> &s;hame mankind.</P>
<P>The incomparable Mrs. Tucker is not held up here as a
grateful per&s;on in contra&s;t to the PUBLICATOR; for <HI>&s;he owed</HI>
no gratitude either to Dr. or to Mrs. Berkeley, unle&s;s it was for
uniting with the <HI>whole</HI> church, city, and neighbourhood,

what is above all, by her throughly polite accompli&s;hed

The Editor regrets that &s;he has tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed &s;o long on the
patience of the Reader. Having delivered her &s;entiments
freely on Gratitude and Ingratitude, it would be unpar|donable
in her to clo&s;e this long Preface, without acknow|ledging
the great obligations &s;he feels that &s;he lies under
to &s;everal amiable friends of her excellent Son, and of her
unworthy &s;elf, not for any the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;crawling
the&s;e undige&s;ted immethodical pages. It would be inju&s;|tice,
it would be more, it would be cruelty, to let it be
&s;u&s;pected, that any literary friend, learned male or culti|vated
female, had the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare in this poor per|formance.
The Editor is at pre&s;ent too far removed from
the pre&s;s; and, franking being, alas! almo&s;t annihilated, &s;he
has not had it in her power even to con&s;ult a friend capa|ble
of directing or advi&s;ing her, one only excepted, who
was <HI>too tenderly</HI> affected at hearing half a dozen lines <HI>redde,</HI>
however excellently qualified to direct, advi&s;e, or correct

Had either lived to &s;ee how lamentably &s;he acquits her&s;elf

more angry at her repeated declarations that &s;he did not

<P>In Mr. Monck Berkeley's benevolent vindication, in the
Author's Preface to the Poems, he exhorts people to re|member
that the Reviewers are but MEN. If tho&s;e Gen|tlemen
conde&s;cend to review a few pages written by a fe|minine
pen, the Editor wi&s;hes them to remember, that
&s;he is a <HI>Woman,</HI> a &s;uffering OLD <HI>Woman,</HI> with mo&s;t of the
accompli&s;hments at three&s;core that mo&s;t females have at
<Q REND="inline">"the age of man,"</Q> ten years later&mdash;that &s;he &s;erved an ap|prentice&s;hip
to <HI>extreme</HI> anxiety and angui&s;h for very near
&s;even years&mdash;&s;eeing daily the declining &s;tate of health of
the two neare&s;t and deare&s;t connections in life, obliged to
<HI>affect</HI> ea&s;e, and often cheerfulne&s;s, whil&s;t her heart bled at
every vein. Unfortunately for her, both Father and Son,
through their lives, declared, that if the Editor's con&s;tant,
even cheerfulne&s;s, never high, never low, failed, both
would give them&s;elves up to ab&s;olute de&s;pair. The &s;trong
exertions nece&s;&s;ary to act the part to <HI>their</HI> &s;atisfaction
have certainly brought on a premature old age; and the
Editor, according to the witty, wi&s;e, pious, Bi&s;hop
Taylor, <Q REND="inline">"is quite ready-dre&s;&s;ed for the grave,"</Q> whither
&s;he &s;eems ha&s;ting apace. The Bi&s;hop, in his "Holy
Dying," &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"dim eyes, gray hairs, &s;tiff joints,"</Q> &amp;c.
&amp;c. are all &s;o many <Q REND="inline">"<HI>dre&s;&s;ings</HI> for the grave."</Q> He does
not add dulled faculties; <HI>I</HI> am &s;ure he might, although
<PB N="cclxv" REF="277">
perhaps, HE might not feel it; his own wit being <HI>too well</HI>
tempered to have the keenne&s;s of its edge blunted by aught
but death it&s;elf. That is the lot of but very few. Per|haps
the great Mr. Burke may e&s;cape it, who yet, ten
years ago, complained of his tongue and his fingers. They
have, however, enabled him to hold his pen to be&s;tow
<HI>heavy,</HI> although <HI>very ju&s;t,</HI> cha&s;ti&s;ement where it was meet
and right to do it. Long may he wield it, a terror, one
&s;hould hope, to <Q REND="inline">"all who offend through MALICIOUS
WICKEDNESS,"</Q> to whom the P&s;almi&s;t, &s;peaking by the

<P>To attempt doing ju&s;tice to the goodne&s;s of Friends
(&s;ome now no longer inhabitants of earth), to Mr. Berke|ley's,

paper, now, like mo&s;t other things, become a very dear
commodity. Through the cour&s;e of this work, written by
ha&s;ty &s;natches, &s;ometimes laid by for many months un|touched,
&s;o as to have occa&s;ioned much di&s;agreeable tauto|logy,
the copy was never tran&s;cribed; &s;o that it was &s;ent
rough to the pre&s;s; and much gratitude is due to the
Printer, for his patience in decyphering all the interlinea|tions
in it, without the aid of the worthy Sir Francis Willes&mdash;the &s;ame per&s;on and the &s;ame action brought twice on
the <HI>tapis</HI> when once would have done&mdash;but much fault has
been found with the author of "Anecdotes of the two la&s;t

<PB N="cclxvi" REF="278">
the &s;ame time of many of the per&s;onages; perhaps they
might not come to the author's knowledge until the fir&s;t
part was printed off, as many things have occurred to the
now treacherous memory of the Editor after it was too late
to in&s;ert them in their proper place. She has therefore
taken leave to in&s;ert them in a le&s;s proper one; for which
&s;he thinks &s;he ought rather to beg her own pardon for being
&s;uch a fool as to in&s;ert the mat all, than the Reader's,
for in&s;erting, perhaps at page 7, what, if method had been
attended to, ought to have been placed at page 2.</P>

not to learn a word of Greek for &s;ix months. The time
is ju&s;t now expired, and &s;o I &s;hall &s;et to it again."</Q>&mdash;Dr.
Berkeley exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child, how could you
be &s;uch a fool?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I cannot help it, Sir, I was angry,
and <HI>I made a vow,</HI> and <HI>I re&s;olved</HI> to keep it, come what
would."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was, as has been &s;hewn before,
&s;teady as a rock.&mdash;Later in life he made a more important
<PB N="cclxviii" REF="280">
vow. One night at Brooks's he and his learned beloved
Eton St. Andrew's friend, the learned T. Hobhou&s;e,
E&s;quire, were drawn in to play deeper than Mr. Berkeley,
at lea&s;t, ought to have done. The amiable, worthy Mr.
Hobhou&s;e has a very good maternal e&s;tate. Mr. Berkeley,
as is u&s;ual, won a frightfully large &s;um, &s;oon lo&s;t it again,
and all the money in his pur&s;e, and much more than he
had at his chambers to pay it. Very providentially Mrs.
Frin&s;ham happened to be in town. Early the next morning
he po&s;ted off to Duke Street. Mrs. Frin&s;ham, &s;omewhat
&s;urprized at hearing from her &s;ervant that Mr. Berkeley was
come before nine o'clock, went out to him; the ca&s;e was
related, and that generous friend in&s;tantly enabled him to
di&s;charge his <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> his <HI>la&s;t, gaming</HI> debt; telling him,
<Q REND="inline">"that &s;he never felt &s;uch plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from having
money at command."</Q> She has, in her youth, often re|lieved
&s;o very largely, as to deny her&s;elf for months the
elegant nece&s;&s;aries of young ladies, to accommodate a
particular friend, or an old acquaintance. Mr. Berkeley
going down &s;oon after to his father's, on the evening of
his arrival, a&s;ked his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"If &s;he had heard what a
<HI>fool</HI> her &s;on had been;"</Q> to which &s;he replying, <Q REND="inline">"That
&s;he did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool
by any one, but his <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> now and then;"</Q>
he related the above-mentioned circum&s;tance, adding,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, you may &s;et <HI>your heart at re&s;t</HI> from any
fear of your Son's ever becoming a game&s;ter; <HI>for, as &s;oon</HI>

<HI>as</HI> I got home to the Temple, I kneeled down, and be|&s;ought
God to ca&s;t out my prayer if EVER I again played
for any &s;um more than I could well afford to lo&s;e, play|ing
now and then with one's neighbours in the country
on a winter evening."</Q> It has, I believe, been mentioned
above, that Mr. Berkeley, whenever he did play, which
was very &s;eldom, and a very indifferent whi&s;t-player he
was, almo&s;t con&s;tantly won.&mdash;All his winnings went to
relieve the poor.</P>
<P>But to return: Dr. Berkeley told his &s;on that Dr.
L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> acted highly right, and that he &s;hould have
e&s;teemed it rather a compliment than a puni&s;hment. To
which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, NO, Sir, not if you had ever been
at &s;chool, and knew <HI>what</HI> it was to lo&s;e a place. He
&s;aid aloud, 'That mine was by much the be&s;t exerci&s;e;'
and he <HI>ought,</HI> therefore, in <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> to have given <HI>me</HI>
the place."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was then a child: he thought
differently of the matter a few years afterwards.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley certainly did not inherit his wonderful
daring re&s;olutene&s;s either from his amiable Father, or from
his Mother; but, probably, as well as his fine figure, from
his Mother's father, whom the Editor has frequently heard
relate the following fact concerning him&s;elf: <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frin|&s;ham
lo&s;t his beautiful mother at twenty-four, ju&s;t when
he was five years old."</Q> (His father lived a widower
<PB N="cclxx" REF="282">
near fifty years). Some time before her death, the
&s;ervant went into the room where they were at breakfa&s;t,
&s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">"Ma&s;ter would not eat his me&s;s for breakfa&s;t,
but wanted coffee, <HI>like</HI> his Mamma."</Q>&mdash;Up &s;prang his Father,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will give him coffee!</HI>"</Q> went and gave him a good
whipping&mdash;&s;till the me&s;s was refu&s;ed&mdash;a &s;econd whipping,
with no better &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;at length a third, when his mother
called out, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frin&s;ham, let him alone, if he won't eat
it now, he will eat it when he is hungry, don't whip him
any more."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will whip him till <HI>to-morrow morning</HI> if
he does not eat it before."</Q> The Editor has frequently
heard her father &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that he had re&s;olved to endure &s;e|ven
or eight flagellations;"</Q> but the declaration, <Q REND="inline">"that
they &s;hould be continued until the next morning"</Q>
determined him to eat it immediately, which he ac|cordingly
did, always ob&s;erving, how wi&s;e it was to
break children of &s;tubbornne&s;s in their infancy. It pro|bably
eradicated it in Mr. Frin&s;ham; for a &s;weeter tem|pered
child never lived, as the Editor has frequently heard
a worthy woman declare, who went to keep his father's
hou&s;e, on the death of his Mother&mdash;&s;he lived to near
ninety, and always made an annual vi&s;it at Mr. and after
his death at Mrs. Frin&s;ham's&mdash;that <Q REND="inline">"he was the mo&s;t amia|ble
of children, and of youths."</Q> When Mr. Frin&s;ham
&s;ent his &s;ons to Oxford, this careful &s;ervant went to take
care of another, and a third &s;et of poor motherle&s;s children;
by which means, and the little bounties of her adopted
<PB N="cclxxi" REF="283">
children, &s;he obtained &s;ufficient to maintain her more than
decently, genteely. She was ever a parlour gue&s;t in all
the gentlemen's families whom &s;he had brought up. She
had by her father, in very early youth, been married to a
gentleman who de&s;erted her, and went to live abroad; &s;he
was therefore a <HI>&s;afe</HI> hou&s;ekeeper for young widowers. Her
fir&s;t &s;ervice was Mr. Frin&s;ham's Father's. The Editor has
frequently, &s;ince &s;he grew up, heard her &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that her
mother, going to vi&s;it her &s;oon after &s;he went thither,
addre&s;&s;ed her thus: 'My dear child, this is a very heavy
charge that you have taken upon your&s;elf. If you do not
take the utmo&s;t care, the <HI>&s;ame</HI> care of the&s;e beautiful

u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I felt horror at the thoughts of my mother's
cur&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>It was mentioned above, that a de&s;perate ague obliged
Mrs. Berkeley to re&s;ign the ta&s;k of nur&s;ing her &s;on to ano|ther.
The per&s;on who a few years before had nur&s;ed
Charles Hayes, E&s;quire, now Fellow of King's College,
was by his dear tenderly beloved mother, of who&s;e amia|ble
&s;weetne&s;s to the rich, and godlike charity and com|pa&s;&s;ion
to <HI>all</HI> the &s;urrounding poor, the Editor often
thinks, &s;ometimes talks, with extatic delight, when &s;he
reflects, that &s;he is gone to Him who in&s;pired, and is
<PB N="cclxxii" REF="284">
<HI>now</HI> rewarding tho&s;e lovely tempers. May her &s;ons,
when they <HI>venture</HI> to marry, meet with ladies as amiable,
as worthy, as their lovely mother; as &s;en&s;ible as their
great grand-mother, not famed for &s;weet temper, the
Editor's great aunt, elde&s;t daughter of William Cherry,
E&s;quire, as a reward for their kind care of their little kin&s;|man
at Eton.&mdash;The Editor &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>venture;</HI>"</Q> marriage was

re&s;embling a very fine original picture of Anne

the brave worthy Sir John Borla&s;e Warren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brave excellent officer &s;ome few years ago met with, it is hoped, a &s;ingular in&s;tance of ingratitude.

<P>Judge Hayes u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that his &s;on Charles

once nearly killed a young man, who attempted to take
&s;ome improper liberties with her, when &s;he could hardly
be &s;tyled a woman."</Q> Mr. Charles Hayes and Mr. Monck
Berkeley were very generous to her when they grew up.
Mr. Hayes always admired the wonderful genius of Mr.
Berkeley, who &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hort holydays of
Whit&s;untide at Holyport, with his kind kin&s;men. The Judge
one day exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I never &s;aw &s;uch a creature in
my life as Berkeley. I am per&s;uaded, that if I were
to &s;ay I am in di&s;tre&s;s how to get five hundred pounds
conveyed to the Lord Mayor of York, Berkeley would
in&s;tantly &s;tart up, and &s;ay, 'Dear Sir, give me leave to
go and carry it for you;' not feeling any impropriety at
the idea of a boy, of ju&s;t then thirteen, being &s;o em|ployed;
and, what is more, I am &s;ure, if he undertook
it, he would execute it as well at thirteen as any man of
three and twenty. He is a mo&s;t wonderful being."</Q> In|deed
his bright genius &s;hone forth in a &s;plendid manner to
the la&s;t breath he drew.</P>
<P><PB N="cclxxiv" REF="286">
Mr. Berkeley ever retained a grateful &s;en&s;e of kind invi|tations
from friends at Wind&s;or&mdash;the late Lady Colerance;
his Mother's near relation, the amiable excellent Mrs.
Che&s;&s;yre; the Lady of his Mother's old <HI>very intimate</HI> friend,
the late agreeable Dr. Bo&s;tock, Canon of Wind&s;or; and
his relation good Mrs. Hayes, and the very worthy Mr.
Trevanian.</P>
<P>Any attempt to enumerate and de&s;cant on, as they me|rit,
the innumerable, amiable, re&s;pectful attentions paid to
Mr. Berkeley, even by &s;trangers, to every thing but his
name and connections in the Land of kind Ho&s;pitality,
would fill almo&s;t as many pages as the learned accompli&s;hed
Mr. Malone has filled in defending his favourite, the im|mortal
Shak&s;peare. Had Mr. Monck Berkeley been living,
it had doubtle&s;s rou&s;ed the ire of that young Poet; but
Mr. Malone needs no coadjutor in any bu&s;ine&s;s that worthy
gentleman takes in hand.</P>
<P>The Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh did Mr. Berkeley
the honour to elect him a member, when he was only
nineteen years old, an honour perhaps never before con|firmed
on one &s;o very young, on his &s;ending them a mo&s;t
excellent account of a very curious quarry in the heart of
the Highlands. Mr. Berkeley had the honour to have the
freedom of Aberdeen, and &s;ome other cities, and of many
<PB N="cclxxv" REF="287">
towns, pre&s;ented to him. He con&s;tantly delivered them
to his Mother, reque&s;ting her to take great care of
them.</P>
<P>How would Mr. Berkeley's &s;pirit have been rou&s;ed, had
he lived to hear the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The throughly brave are never cruel. There are few who have not heard the bravery of Lord Balcarras at Saratoga, under General Burgoyne.

<P>To the introduction of his friend, Mr. Lennard, Mr.

and his charming Lady, daughter of Mr. Dacre of
the North, to whom Mr. Lennard was related. He ad|mired

Alas! &s;he repeats it, &s;he <HI>feels,</HI> that &s;he fell &s;hort; and yet,

<P>The Editor, as above &s;hewn, with her children did not

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will have this or that done.</HI>"</Q> She has ever, with

The preceding and &s;ucceeding context might be here with

chapter redde with advantage by tho&s;e who have never
murdered a man. The Editor, however, feels her&s;elf
obliged to vindicate her&s;elf from the <HI>bare</HI> &s;u&s;picion of
Antinomiani&s;m by quoting No. XLIV. of "The Deep

<P>On this one of the &s;elected numbers being redde to Mr.

God forbid!!!"</Q> It was mentioned before, that the Edi|tor,
con&s;tantly, on quitting her Son's chamber, wrote un|der
every number his comments, ejaculations, &amp;c. upon it.
She mo&s;t carefully &s;elected what &s;he felt &s;uited the <HI>then</HI>
&s;tate of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley did not want in&s;truction in his duty to God
or his neighbour. He did not want to be awakened, to be
&s;hewn how direfully he had broken the <Q REND="inline">"Holy Law of
God,"</Q> nor to be made &s;en&s;ible of the penalty to be in|flicted
for &s;uch breach; but to be convinced that Chri&s;t
had received him, which his deep humility prevented
him from believing, although the <HI>hope</HI> of it was his <HI>&s;ole</HI>
&s;upport.</P>
<P>One night, when he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf expiring at Dover,
Mr. Berkeley de&s;ired his friend, Mrs. Frin&s;ham, might be
called out of bed to him: he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I be&s;eech you to pray

<P>It ought to have been mentioned in its proper place,
that Mr. Berkeley wrote to his Mother from Oxford, de|&s;iring
her to &s;ummon all her <HI>fortitude</HI> to her aid, and pre|pare
her mind not to be &s;hocked at &s;eeing the <HI>&s;hadow</HI> of
<PB N="cclxxxv" REF="297">
what was <HI>once</HI> her Son. The original idea was, that of
Mr. Berkeley's going to Glouce&s;ter to be con&s;tantly under
the eye of Dr. Che&s;tern. He therefore wrote, reque&s;ting
his friends to meet him on the road; accordingly, the mi|nute
the po&s;t arrived, they, accompanied by their incom|parable
friend, Mrs. D. Monck, &s;et out and reached the
inn at Burford about five in the afternoon, and about
&s;even Mr. Berkeley arrived, attended by his own &s;ervant,
and a youth of about eighteen, the &s;on of an old Iri&s;h
friend of Dr. Berkeley's, then &s;taying with Dr. Berkeley,
who had been di&s;patched to meet Mr. Berkeley, who had
done amiably, as he ever did, to warn his Mother not to
be &s;hocked, &amp;c. It required ALL her fortitude to &s;ee her
idol with difficulty get out of the chai&s;e, and enter the
room, &s;upported, rather <HI>difficultly</HI> &s;upported, by his &s;ervant,
a man about his own &s;tature.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley had gone to town to vi&s;it her Son, and
dear, excellent Mr. Grim&s;ton, who&s;e goodne&s;s cau&s;ed his
remaining in town all the &s;ummer with Mr. Berkeley, un|til
Augu&s;t, when they &s;et off for Ha&s;tings. Five months
of almo&s;t unabated torture had wonderfully weakened Mr.
Berkeley's <Q REND="inline">"<HI>earthly tabernacle.</HI>"</Q> Dr. Berkeley's great weak|ne&s;s
apologized for his appearing di&s;pirited; and Mrs.
Berkeley forced her&s;elf to appear not to feel &s;upreme an|gui&s;h
of mind at the &s;ight of her IDOL thus debilitated.</P>
<P><PB N="cclxxxvi" REF="298">
Dr. Berkeley, ri&s;ing about ten o'clock, &s;aid to his

to &s;hake hands with him and retire, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Be&s;t of Mo|thers,

very little probability now, &s;hould I live ever to have a

and to family prayers."</Q> The young man &s;tared to hear
the energy with which Mr. Berkeley uttered this &s;entence;

he turned round, and, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Yes,

<P>It is has been before ob&s;erved, that Mr. Berkeley

It was near two o'clock in the morning, before Mr.
Berkeley, apologizing to his Mother, told her that he would
detain her no longer, fearing that the want of a good night's
re&s;t might injure her health. Mr. Berkeley always knew
that the lo&s;s of &s;leep is almo&s;t death to his Mother, who&s;e
Mother and Si&s;ter could, and the dear &s;urvivor can, pa&s;s
weeks in health, with &s;carce any &s;leep at all. Mrs. Berke|ley
in that, as in other things, re&s;embles her Father.&mdash;When
young, her Mother u&s;ed to tell the Editor, that
&s;he thought &s;he <HI>could</HI> not be <HI>her</HI> child, becau&s;e &s;he u&s;ed
to wi&s;h to leave a ball-room at four o'clock&mdash;her Mother
telling her often that &s;he u&s;ed to &s;tay till <HI>eight,</HI> then drive
home &s;everal miles, exchange her ball-dre&s;s for her morning
one, and not go to re&s;t till twelve next night, or rather
morning; for her mother, Mrs. Cherry, never retired to
her chamber till twelve, and con&s;tantly ro&s;e, winter and
&s;ummer, at &s;ix, until within two years of her death, at
&s;ixty-eight, when &s;he ro&s;e not until &s;even o'clock. It was
little likely that Mrs. Berkeley &s;hould enjoy much &s;leep
after &s;o intere&s;ting a conver&s;ation of four hours.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley is &s;aid, by all tho&s;e who have known her
mo&s;t intimately from her childhood, to be of the mo&s;t
hopeful temper they ever knew: &s;he pre&s;erves with tendere&s;t
care a hair ring given by her dear Son; an elegant figure of
Hope leaning on her anchor, one hand pointing up to
<PB N="ccxci" REF="303">
heaven, with this motto in hair, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Heaven's be&s;t gift to
man.</HI>"</Q> It is very certain, that until &s;he &s;aw her Son the
day after his happy &s;pirit had quitted his fine form &s;he
did flatter her&s;elf, that the mercy of God would &s;pare him
to her; under the idea of having laboured from her youth
to obey, oblige, delight her own excellent Mother, in
order to make her feel le&s;s poignantly the lo&s;s of an al|mo&s;t
adoring hu&s;band, that God would vouch&s;afe to reward
her in KIND, and &s;pare her Son. But, alas! her Son was
her idol; and idols mu&s;t be given up. The Editor was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be idolized by <HI>her</HI> Mother, of whom it u&s;ed
to be &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Frin&s;ham loves her &s;o much, that &s;he
never lets her walk acro&s;s the room without looking at
her (little in&s;ignificant figure) with plea&s;ure in her eyes."</Q>
That delight mu&s;t have ari&s;en from thinking &s;he bore &s;ome
re&s;emblance to her excellent Father. The Editor has the
plea&s;ure to reflect that there was nothing &s;he would not
have &s;acrificed to plea&s;e the be&s;t of Mothers, and that &s;he
always prayed to God that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;pare her
life, if it were only for <HI>one week</HI> beyond her Mother's, that &s;he
might be &s;pared the affliction of &s;eeing her go before her. The
Editor felt that &s;he was the cau&s;e of much &s;ad anxiety to her
Mother, not having had the &s;mall pox, as her excellent &s;i&s;ter
had when a child, at Mrs. Sheeles's &s;chool, and its being la|mentably
fatal in Mrs. Frin&s;ham's family, her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter

She proved her right to that plea&s;ing &s;ubrique, by rejecting, for the &s;ake of the Editor's father with a &s;mall fortune, but un|common worth, numbers of brilliant &s;plendid matches. Her ideas on that head de&s;cended to her daughter and her grand&s;on. It is a little remarkable that there was a very &s;trong re&s;emblance in the faces of Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frin|&s;ham, &s;o as to &s;trike Dr. Berkeley him&s;elf the fir&s;t time he &s;aw her pictures.

latter part the Editor has no doubt but &s;he had re&s;embled her
lovely Aunt, had &s;he not been inoculated by Mr. Sutton
him&s;elf, who attended her at her own hou&s;e at Acton,
with great a&s;&s;iduity, Dr. Berkeley being then rector of
that pari&s;h. They were &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch a
Preacher. Multitudes came every Sunday to Acton church,
to hear one who, according to St. Paul, did not, as, he
ob&s;erved to the Editor in his la&s;t illne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"preach him&s;elf,
BUT CHRIST JESUS THE LORD;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"HE knows I
<PB N="ccxciii" REF="305">
preached him in SINCERITY, always dreading to be a
popular preacher, a plea&s;er of the people."</Q></P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations are intended &s;olely to benefit
&s;ome few unfortunate families where the &s;mall pox is wor&s;e
than the plague. Mrs. Berkeley having not long weaned
her &s;econd &s;on, and duly prepared by Mr. Sutton, her
friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her
what, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, it is to thou&s;ands, to mil|lions,
not to her&s;elf; <HI>&s;he</HI> conceived, if &s;he e&s;caped with
life, that would be all; but the &s;ufferings, her not having
had that frightful di&s;ea&s;e <HI>had</HI> occa&s;ioned to her Mother,
<HI>did</HI> con&s;tantly occa&s;ion to an almo&s;t adoring Hu&s;band, and
the tendere&s;t of Si&s;ters, determined her one way or other to
deliver them from their ince&s;&s;ant anxiety; accordingly &s;he,
together with Mr. Monck Berkeley, then between four and
five years old, were both inoculated on the &s;ame day,
with the &s;ame matter. The latter had only three pu&s;tules,
and did not lo&s;e half an hour's play through indi&s;po&s;ition.
His Mother had but few in her face, tho&s;e on her no&s;e
pitted to the bone, a va&s;t number on her head, a fright|ful
quantity in her throat, and &s;everal on her arms, fingers,
and feet; all &s;hewed their malignity by being confluent,
and not turning until three and twenty days&mdash;a plain
proof, but for Mr. Sutton's method of treating the &s;mall
pox, &s;he had &s;hared the fate of her beautiful aunt Mi&s;s
Cherry. Mr. Sutton a&s;&s;erted to Dr. Berkeley and others,
<PB N="ccxiv" REF="306">
Mrs. Berkeley's friends, that he had never before had &s;uch
a patient. He was much alarmed, and exceedingly atten|tive,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that had Mrs. Berkeley caught the &s;mall
pox in the natural way, &s;he would have mortified in a
few days; that had Mr. Monck Berkeley caught it in the
natural way, it had probably never have been known that
he had had it."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's mother, Mrs. Frin&s;ham,
had only ten pu&s;tules, when a child about eight years old.
A &s;ingular &s;ymptom attended Mrs. Berkeley's &s;mall pox,
that of her eyes being, for more than three days, &s;et in
their &s;ockets, &s;o fixed that &s;he could not move them at
all, could only &s;ee in an ab&s;olutely &s;traight direction; yet
&s;he had not one pu&s;tule in her eyes, or on her eye-lids;
it was quite internal.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley had been at fir&s;t at Sutton Hou&s;e; but,
having always a wonderful partiality for her own home,
which &s;he conceives would be the ca&s;e if her home was a
neat clean barn, begged Mr. Sutton's permi&s;&s;ion to return
to her own hou&s;e, with which he very obligingly complied,
on condition of her going to him when he could not call
on her, which &s;he punctually did, her hor&s;es having no|thing
el&s;e to do, but drag her then wretched frame to take
the air, as directed, half a dozen times in the day, &s;he be|ing
unable to walk. Mrs. Berkeley, in her vi&s;its to Sutton
Hou&s;e, u&s;ed to enquire of the &s;en&s;ible well-bred Reverend
Mr. Houlton, chaplain to Mr. Sutton, when her eyes would
<PB N="ccxcv" REF="307">
be better? his con&s;tant an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear Madam,
you will be in heaven to morrow, I a&s;&s;ure you."</Q> The
next day Mrs. Berkeley, on entering the drawing-room,
enquired of her fellow patients where Mr. Houlton was, that
&s;he might tell him, <Q REND="inline">"She did not like HIS, Mr. HOULTON's,
heaven at all."</Q> The very witty Canon Bowles, of Sali&s;|bury,
being one of the patients, opened the door, and
called out, <Q REND="inline">"Houlton, come down; her is Mrs. Berkeley,
the lady of a Divine, that declares &s;he does not even <HI>wi&s;h</HI>
to go to heaven;&mdash;come down, man, and talk to the
poor lady."</Q></P>
<P>A lady, who&s;e name is not at pre&s;ent remembered by
the Editor, came down one morning, looking much di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I am very ill indeed."</Q> She &s;ent for the
&s;en&s;ible, clever, <HI>con&s;oling</HI> hou&s;ekeeper, and exhibited her
che&s;t covered over with a mo&s;t tremendous ery&s;ipelas. The
hou&s;ekeeper &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Do not fear, Madam; if it plea&s;e God,
you will get &s;afe through;"</Q> the lady, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>If I do,</HI> I &s;hall be the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of my family
that ever did."</Q> It did plea&s;e Providence to bring
her &s;afely through, and &s;pare her to a mo&s;t anxious
hu&s;band, who vi&s;ited her with trembling tenderne&s;s per|petually.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley &s;uffered much from the kind per&s;ecutions
of Dr. Berkeley and her Si&s;ter, to &s;uffer Sir William Duncan
<PB N="ccxcvi" REF="308">
and Dr. Addington <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Addington u&s;ed frequently to tell the Editor, that the fir&s;t fee he ever received was at the hou&s;e of Mr. Frin&s;ham.

to the terre&s;trial part of man. Mrs. Berkeley re&s;olved to
live or die, as it &s;hould plea&s;e the all-wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all
events, by Mr. Sutton alone. Being at that time a little in

to him, obligingly telling her, <Q REND="inline">"One line from her

<P>It is the fa&s;hion with per&s;ons of a certain de&s;cription

<P>We have an high authority for knowing, <Q REND="inline">"He that wa|tereth,

his introduction to his noble, highly-honoured, re&s;pected
friends, their Graces the Duke and Duche&s;s of Marl|borough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had Mr. Berkeley been living, how &s;incerely, how tenderly, would he have &s;ympathized with that illu&s;trious pair on their late lo&s;s. The Editor re|joices that their Graces have &s;till two &s;ons (although &s;he had none), a very amiable young nobleman, and a very fine youth, who, by having his late, learned, accompli&s;hed brother held up as a pattern, may be &s;timulated to re|&s;emble him.

He one day &s;aid to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"If God &s;pares my life until next &s;ummer, I mean to &s;tep abroad, and vi&s;it my friend Lord Henry Spencer."</Q> The Edi|tor does not recollect where his Lord&s;hip then was. Mrs. Berkeley's con&s;tant, advice to her Son was, whil&s;t per&s;ons of high rank or &s;tation treat you as a gen|tleman, a man of family, although <HI>untitled,</HI> always remember that they are <HI>your</HI> &s;uperiors; but, the in&s;tant they forget, have nothing more to do with them. Mr. Monck Berkeley never would vi&s;it, or meet, notwith&s;tanding all her Lady|&s;hip's <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions,</HI> a poor &s;illy Peere&s;s, his near relation, who, having a <HI>very</HI> &s;hort memory, had <HI>quite</HI> forgot her kin&s;man, until &s;he learned in town, that it was <HI>ton</HI> to be acquainted with Mr. Monck Berkeley. So much for the pre&s;ent of her Lady&s;hip's WISDOM. When the Marquis of Blandford went to Eton, the then Dean of Canterbury, who went down with him, de&s;ired Mr. Monck Berkeley, about two or three years older, to take his Lord&s;hip under his pro|tection, <HI>i.e.</HI> as the Editor conceives, to &s;ee that they are not <HI>too</HI> much buffeted by their own or an higher form; a certain <HI>quantum</HI> is excellent for&mdash;the Editor had almo&s;t &s;aid Kings; however, <HI>certainly</HI> for <Q REND="inline">"Lords and Commons."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, having known this, and his Son's telling him that the Marquis of Blandford was at Chri&s;t Church, on Mr. Monck Berkeley's fir&s;t return from Oxford to the Oaks, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e Lord Blandford had quite forgot you; it is &s;o long &s;ince you left Eton, (near &s;even years.)</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my dear Sir, you are mi&s;taken; being engaged to dine one day at the noblemen's table at Chri&s;t Church, and &s;eeing Lord Blandford come into the hall, I determined to wait, thinking he might <HI>really</HI> might have forgotten me; but the in&s;tant his eye caught me, he &s;prang forward, and took me by the hand, &s;aying, 'My dear Berkeley, how do you do?

Every one at the time, near thirty years ago, heard the rencontre of the then very &s;en&s;ible, polite, agreeable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;ter in Chancery.</NOTE> Ma&s;ter P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s with Lord.

old friend, the Reverend Dr. King, now Chancellor of
Lincoln. Mr. Berkeley happened to be at his father's,
when Dr. King was appointed to Dr. Tanner's vacant
&s;tall in the church of Canterbury. Immediately on
hearing it, he, with his wonted &s;weetne&s;s, when a&s;king
a favour of either of his parents, &s;aid to his Father,
<PB N="ccc" REF="312">
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I &s;hould take it as a very great favour
if you would have the goodne&s;s to invite Dr. King to

as I believe, although a mo&s;t excellent &s;cholar,
he is entirely ignorant of all matters of this kind, and
you are <HI>au fait</HI> in them. He was exceedingly kind and
good to me when I was at Eton, and when we u&s;ed to
go over together to Lord Inchiquin's," (that elegant no|bleman,
one of the friends of Dr. Berkeley's very early
youth at Cloyne, mo&s;t amiably kind to Mr. Berkeley when
at Eton,) "and to Sir Adam Gordon's," (a very old friend
equally kind,) "and it would delight me to have it in my
power to &s;hew my gratitude to him."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley de&s;ired his Son to write immediately to
Dr. King, and &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that, although he, Mr. Berkeley,
mu&s;t probably be ab&s;ent, Dr. Berkeley reque&s;ted the

E&s;quire. Dr. King expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of the little attentions
it was in Mrs. Berkeley's power to &s;hew him, more highly
than they merited. She reque&s;ted him, if it was in his power,
to do her Son the honour to introduce him at Blenheim;
Mrs. Berkeley, having ever, from a young woman, be|fore

&s;he married, declared, if ever &s;he had a &s;on, &s;he would
try to introduce him to that noble family, in preference to

was very uncommonly amiable, and had much worth.</P>
<P>The Editor cannot avoid dropping a tear over the too early

Dr. King in his &s;econd vi&s;it to Dr. Berkeley's, his bro|ther-in-law,

boys, much younger, at the King's School, the worthy
Mr. William Jack&s;on, &s;on of the Collector of Exci&s;e, and
afterwards an Alderman of Canterbury. This grateful,
well-informed young man died, after a very few days illne&s;s,

His wonderfully low-lived parents gave rings of
his hair, &s;et with diamonds, to many of the ladies of Can|terbury,
who would not have known that he exi&s;ted, as
him&s;elf u&s;ed to &s;ay, but for Mrs. Berkeley's gratitude; which
when he, at nineteen, quitted the King's School, led her
to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the
younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs. Mrs. Berkeley
<PB N="cccv" REF="317">
introduced him to her learned friend the Reverend John
Duncombe and his Lady, and reque&s;ted them, when &s;he

<P>But, quitting this &s;ubject for a much plea&s;anter, Jack&s;on
immediately pre&s;ented him&s;elf in Mrs. Berkeley's dre&s;&s;ing|room,
<PB N="cccvi" REF="318">
when &s;he introduced him to Mr. Manby, reque&s;ting
him to become his guide, to conduct him to every thing
worthy notice in the church or city, to repair to the Oaks
every morning at breakfa&s;t, and every day at three to take
their dinner with Mrs. Berkeley, and &s;pend the afternoon;
the Prebendaries dining together at each other's hou&s;es,
during the audit, the tables generally being full; and taking
their tea in the audit-room.</P>
<P>On the day when they dined at Dr. Berkeley's,
on Mrs. Berkeley's entering the eating-room, the dinner
&s;erved, the Bi&s;hop of Norwich, then Dean, going up to
her, pre&s;ented her with a pamphlet, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Madam,
entirely in obedience to your commands, there is the
&s;ermon that I preached on Trinity Sunday. If it pro|duces
any good, it is entirely owing to you, for it has been

but you in&s;i&s;ted upon its being publi&s;hed; and I have
obeyed your orders."</Q> Many of the Prebendaries &s;aid,
the public were very much indebted to Mrs. Berkeley.
The Bi&s;hop, when &s;itting at dinner, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t reque&s;t

polite attention from her mo&s;t excellent old friend, and
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"She would reque&s;t a few to &s;end to &s;ome of her

<P>When the audit was ended, and the good little Doctor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The next time Mrs. Berkeley &s;aw her Son, after his good friend, Dr. King's vi&s;it at the Oaks, he enquired, <Q REND="inline">"how &s;he liked his old friend?"</Q> She replied, as all <HI>will</HI> reply who know him intimately, at the &s;ame time a&s;king Mr. Monck Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"What is Mrs. King like?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Like, my dear Madam, why, like a QUEEN.

and his brother going to quit Canterbury, this mo&s;t amia|ble
of young gentlemen thus addre&s;&s;ed Mrs. Berkeley:
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, what can I do? what can I &s;ay to

<HI>any</HI> time, in <HI>any</HI> way, I can render you <HI>any</HI> &s;ervice, you
will delight my &s;pirit by only pointing it out to me."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley conjured him not to di&s;tre&s;s her, by &s;aying
a &s;yllable more to her, for having <HI>only</HI> done ju&s;t what every
other per&s;on, not a &s;avage, had they known his &s;ituation,
<HI>would</HI> have done.</P>
<P>The Editor cannot here forbear relating a little anecdote
of her Son's lovely amiability, of which &s;he was only very
lately informed, he never having mentioned it. A lady,
who was a &s;tranger, vi&s;iting at Mrs. Berkeley's, happened
to &s;it oppo&s;ite the fine portrait of Mr. Berkeley, painted
by his amiable accompli&s;hed friend, Mr. Peters; &s;he, in a
low voice, &s;aid to the lady who &s;at next to her, <Q REND="inline">"I never
&s;aw &s;o like a picture in my life."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, although
&s;he cannot &s;ee, yet hears remarkably quick, (thanks to
God's ble&s;&s;ing on the &s;kill of Mr. Maull in Piccadilly, ex|erted
about twenty years ago,) &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I did not know, Ma|dam,
that my Son had the honour to be known to you."</Q>
To which the good old lady very politely replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ma|dam,
<HI>I</HI> had the honour to be known to Mr. Berkeley. One
year returning from Margate, we wi&s;hed to &s;ee the cathe|dral
of Canterbury; we walked up, and could not &s;ee
any one to tell us where to find the per&s;on who &s;howed it.
We &s;aw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and
forwards by the &s;ide of the church. After &s;ome time one
<PB N="cccix" REF="321">
of them, detaching him&s;elf from the re&s;t, came up to us,
and, in the polite&s;t manner, &s;aid, 'Ladies, are you in
any di&s;tre&s;s, in which I can a&s;&s;i&s;t you? The ladies told their
wi&s;h to &s;ee the cathedral, and their utter inability to find
out how to do it. Mr. Berkeley &s;aid, 'If you will have
the goodne&s;s to wait two minutes, I will get the verger
to attend you.' He &s;tepped into a &s;hop, &s;ent off a lad
for the verger, and again joined the ladies. On the ar|rival
of the verger, Mr. Berkeley e&s;corted them into the
church, pointed out to them &s;ome particular beauties of
that glorious temple of God, charged the verger not to
omit &s;hewing them &s;ome things as he named; then,
&s;aying 'he had an engagement,' made an elegant bow,
wi&s;hed them a plea&s;ant journey, and took his leave."</Q>
The ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman
was to who&s;e politene&s;s they were &s;o much indebted. He
replied, <Q REND="inline">"that it was Mr. Berkeley, &s;on to one of the Pre|bends."</Q>
The ladies expre&s;&s;ing gratitude, the verger &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, every body loves Mr. Berkeley exceedingly,
he is &s;o kind and conde&s;cending to every one."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley both had been for &s;ome time
wi&s;hing to obtain for their worthy old &s;ervant, Mr. Wright|&s;on,
when he &s;hould marry and quit &s;ervice, the place of
one of his Maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;engers, he having repeatedly flown,
with incredible velocity, over this kingdom, and to and
from Ireland, on Dr. Berkeley's bu&s;ine&s;s; and probably,
<PB N="cccx" REF="322">
had it not plea&s;ed the ALL-WISE Director of ALL things,
<HI>&s;mall</HI> as well as <HI>great,</HI> to remove to the &s;ociety he &s;o &s;trongly
re&s;embled on earth the angelic Mr. Manby, the poor of
Canterbury had not been ble&s;&s;ed with quite &s;o excellent,
&s;o judicious, and &s;o kind a governor, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to their
former very worthy ma&s;ter, Mr. Nott. It is &s;urely a de|light
to every feeling heart, to &s;ee the aged poor made
happy, the young in&s;tructed and brought up indu&s;triou&s;ly,
the way to be happy here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The Editor is much addicted, wherever &s;he re&s;ides or
&s;tays, any little time at a place, to vi&s;it the <HI>work-hou&s;es,</HI>
feeling tender pity for tho&s;e who have not a penny to buy
tobacco, &s;nuff, or a little <HI>two</HI> &s;hilling tea, and <HI>&s;weetened
&s;and,</HI> called &s;ugar, to &s;ea&s;on it. Her feelings &s;uffered much
whil&s;t at Oxford; as &s;he really conceives, from what &s;he
<HI>her&s;elf</HI> &s;aw. The relation of two of her old &s;ervants, whom
&s;he frequently &s;ent thither, that mo&s;t well-regulated Bride|wells
are Paradi&s;es compared to the Oxford Work-hou&s;e;
in &s;hort, nothing out of the infernal regions can be wor&s;e,
or wor&s;e conducted. Mrs. Berkeley's maid, &s;ent thither
one day to &s;ee after a poor &s;ick woman, was obliged to
take &s;helter in a room &s;ome poor creature opened to her;
an audacious harlot flying through the hou&s;e with a great
knife to murder the then poor, &s;tupid, ignorant mi&s;tre&s;s.
They have no poundage from earnings: <HI>once</HI> in the year,
at the <HI>Races,</HI> they have, &s;ome two-pence, &s;ome &s;ix-pence,
<PB N="cccxi" REF="323">
given them, as one of the guardians told Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, to
<HI>figure away</HI> with on the Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, one day, on going out, gave a poor
woman, who had called the mi&s;tre&s;s to her, and &s;hewn her
the <HI>uncultivated</HI> wretched garden, a &s;hilling. The poor wo|man's
gratitude and extacies were &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, adding,
<Q REND="inline">"I have not &s;een a &s;hilling before for two years."</Q> This
poor creature had lived comfortably in London, her hu&s;|band
a ma&s;on, killed by the breaking of a &s;caffold, when
alas! &s;he was wretched enough to belong to &s;ome pari&s;h in
Oxford. Mrs. Berkeley enquired whom among the guar|dians
were tenderly di&s;po&s;ed towards the poor, and was
told, Mr. Slatter the baker, and Mr. Ayton the grocer.
Mr. Slatter &s;erving Dr. Berkeley's family with bread, &s;he
in&s;tantly &s;et off to call on him, and never recollects to have
&s;een a more &s;en&s;ible, well-behaved, humane per&s;on in
humble &s;tation; he would make a better figure in an higher,
than many who have &s;crambled up to it. He a&s;&s;ured her,
that, unable to combat with the <HI>majority</HI> of the guardians
in defence of the poor, he had in de&s;pair relinqui&s;hed it
entirely.</P>
<P>She then went to Mr. Ayton, and received a &s;imilar an|&s;wer.
She exhorted both, but, &s;he fears, in vain. How|ever
unplea&s;ant it might be to continue to fight the battles
of the poor, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them there would come a time
<PB N="cccxii" REF="324">
when they would rejoice that they had done it. Their an|&s;wer
was, that the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t mercenary of the trade&s;|men
were appointed guardians, and there was no oppo&s;ing
them. How different from Canterbury! two mo&s;t re|&s;pectable
trade&s;men out of each of the &s;ixteen pari&s;hes
are annually cho&s;en; &s;ometimes, &s;he conceives, recho&s;en;
as, when &s;he wi&s;hed to get a poor creature going in com|fortably
depo&s;ited, &s;he con&s;tantly went to Dr. Berkeley's
baker, the very worthy, &s;en&s;ible well-bred Mr. John&s;on,
educated at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. On the death of
his father he mo&s;t dutifully and affectionately went home,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t his worthy mother in carrying on her bu&s;ine&s;s.
Mr. John&s;on, if not in office him&s;elf, con&s;tantly took care
to apply to &s;ome worthy man who was. The Editor is no
Democrat; feels horrors at the vile idea of Equality&mdash;but
&s;uch direful <HI>inequality</HI> as a rich <HI>bon-vivant</HI> Oxford trade&s;man&mdash;and the poor, almo&s;t poi&s;oned poor creatures in that vile
workhou&s;e, mu&s;t hurt every heart who has ever redde in
the Bible, <Q REND="inline">"Who maketh thee to differ from an|other?"</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The Editor, after delivering her &s;entiments very freely
on one cla&s;s of people in Oxford, cannot quit the place
without taking notice of a very different cla&s;s, whom &s;he
once had it in contemplation to addre&s;s in the Oxford
Mercury, as &s;he did not feel happy to quit Oxford without
offering her very grateful acknowledgements to them&mdash;the
<PB N="cccxiii" REF="325">
young gentlemen of the Univer&s;ity. It is a general, an al|mo&s;t
univer&s;al complaint among&s;t the Fair Sex. The Edi|tor
begs pardon for a mi&s;nomer; &s;he ought to have written
the RED SEX; for almo&s;t all now re&s;emble <HI>Rouge Dragon</HI>
in Heraldry; to be &s;ure, the pre&s;ent dre&s;s makes them re|&s;embles
Heraldic animals, and Swift's yahoos. The Edi|tor,
famous among&s;t her friends for never wearing any cap
or hat that did not become her &s;ort of face, nor any colour
that did not become her complexion, and was perpetually
con&s;ulted on that &s;ubject by her friends, cannot help think|ing,
that the Father of Mi&s;chief has been the inventor of
the pre&s;ent mode of dre&s;&s;ing, particularly the vile, &s;cooped
out hats, or rather &s;traw caps; &s;he therefore &s;tyles them
<HI>Diabolls.</HI> It is no wonder that hu&s;bands go a&s;tray from
wives &s;o odiou&s;ly disfigured.</P>
<P>That all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at
an end, is a charge perhaps too well founded. An excel|lent
exaltedly pious friend of the Editor's, but lately gone
to glory, the lady of the late very worthy amiable Thomas
Baber, E&s;quire, of Sunninghill Park, and who had the hap|pine&s;s
to be the mother of Edward Baber, E&s;quire, well
known to all in the Ea&s;t for his <HI>inflexible</HI> hone&s;ty. He had
the happine&s;s of throughly pious, as well as accompli&s;hed
parents. This lady, once a mo&s;t celebrated beauty, u&s;ed
to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"The young men of this day are quite Hottentots;
all I expect of them is, that, if I happen to fall down,
<PB N="cccxiv" REF="326">
they will be &s;o good as to kick me a&s;ide, and not walk
over me."</Q> The Editor fears the charge may be too true;
but &s;he feels it a duty incumbent on her to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that if
politene&s;s to females is bani&s;hed from every other place,
it has taken up its re&s;idence among&s;t the <HI>young</HI> gentle|men
of the univer&s;ity of Oxford&mdash;<HI>true</HI> politene&s;s extending
ever to <HI>aged</HI> females."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor, as has been mentioned before, has at &s;ixty
every accompli&s;hment that &s;ome are without at eighty;
frequently, if walking alone, &s;tepping into a <HI>grey</HI> puddle,
mi&s;taking it for a nice clean broad &s;tone. The polite at|tentions
from young gentlemen in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her to cro&s;s
the &s;treet, &s;ometimes accompanying her half a &s;treet's
length to direct her to a &s;hop, opening the door for her,
always giving her the wall, not driving her off the pave|ment,
as two officers did a few years ago at Newca&s;tle,
&s;he leaning on her hu&s;band's arm&mdash;he being dre&s;&s;ed in a
&s;hort ca&s;&s;ock, they &s;uppo&s;ed him a bi&s;hop, as they &s;aid <HI>en
pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and knew <HI>(worthy wights!)</HI> he could not <HI>challenge</HI>
them, but he &s;everely reproved their <HI>brutality.</HI> The Editor
happened to hear that the wife of one of them <HI>amply</HI> re|venged
her quarrel. He almo&s;t de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>The Editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity
of one gentleman, who&s;e name, although &s;he took much
pains to learn it, &s;he never could find out, until the even|ing
<PB N="cccxv" REF="327">
before &s;he quitted Magdalene Lodge, at the clo&s;e of
November 1795, or every grateful, re&s;pectful attention
would have been rendered to the Reverend Mr. Williams,
Sub-warden of Wadham College.</P>
<P>A Lady of fa&s;hion, well known in the polite circles, now
of an age, as well as the Editor, to dre&s;s for <HI>comfort,</HI> not
for &s;hew, having an hou&s;e in the neigbourhood of Oxford,
often walking in the &s;treet with the Editor, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Your
remark is very ju&s;t, that the young men here are <HI>certainly
very well-bred;</HI> if they were not, they would laugh at us&mdash;for, to be &s;ure, you with your black beaver gyp&s;ey hat,
tied down and hiding half your little (politene&s;s prevented
her adding, withered) face, and your ru&s;ty black cloak;
and <HI>I</HI> in my <HI>old</HI> hat and <HI>old</HI> great coat, are two curious
enough figures."</Q> The Editor's excellent relation and
her&s;elf are both old-fa&s;hioned, in making it a point to pay
their butcher and baker every Monday morning. And the
Editor u&s;ed always to tell Dr. Berkeley, and her Son, when
&s;he got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a
&s;ervant, that &s;he did not like a footman attending her,
when &s;he did not appear as if &s;he could pay him his
wages.</P>
<P>The Editor never met with any impertinence, but twice,
during her <HI>&s;ejour</HI> in Oxford.&mdash;One day walking by Baliol
College, a poor creature in <HI>(&s;he &s;uppo&s;es)</HI> a &s;ervitor's gown,
<PB N="cccxvi" REF="328">
expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;like of her hat, and after &s;he was pa&s;&s;ed,
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>he would give a crown to know who &s;he was,</HI>"</Q> the
Editor langui&s;hed to have turned on her heel, and have
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Young man, &s;ave your crown to buy Tru&s;ler's
edition of 'Lord Che&s;terfield's Advice to the amiable
Phil. Stanhope.'&mdash;I will tell you, without reward, that
I am the wife of Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury;"</Q>
but, having with her a lady who always returns pertne&s;s
by <HI>&s;ilent di&s;dain</HI> (which affects not fools, it may wi&s;e per&s;ons)
the Editor's <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> in gratifying the poor low-lived crea|tures
curio&s;ity <HI>gratis</HI> would have hurt her dignity. The
other was, one very hot evening, the Editor had taken in
her hand a <HI>para-&s;ol;</HI> a &s;hower coming on, &s;he held it over
her head, to protect a very good hat. Not far from Chri&s;t|church
&s;he met a number of gentlemen, pu&s;hing home from
the &s;hower, who all pa&s;&s;ed her with their u&s;ual politene&s;s,
&s;tepping off the very narrow pavement, to avoid incom|moding
her; the rear was brought up by a <HI>little</HI> in&s;ignificant
looking animal in a gown, who in a voice, re&s;embling
any thing but that of a young man, &s;queaked out,
<Q REND="inline">"Look, look, here is a lady holding a <HI>para-&s;ol</HI> over her
in this violent &s;hower&mdash;what a fool &s;he mu&s;t be!!!"</Q>
The Editor heard two or three of the gentlemen &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline">"Not at all&mdash;it did not rain (&s;he &s;uppo&s;es they added)
when &s;he &s;et out."</Q> The name of this wi&s;e <HI>little mi&s;s,</HI>

<PB N="cccxvii" REF="329">
creature, without &s;eeing him held up to public con|tempt.</P>
<P>A very worthy friend of the Editor's, whom &s;he has not
had the <HI>delight</HI> of &s;eeing for many years, Mrs. M. Jeffries,
of Richmond, u&s;ed formerly to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"One has <HI>no plea&s;ure</HI>

this wonderfully agreeable, worthy lady, to the Editor's
angelic friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot (when her
excellent friend, the Marchione&s;s de Grey, lent her hou&s;e
at Richmond to Mrs. Talbot), during her lingering illne&s;s,
mu&s;t ever endear her to the Editor, although it is little
likely &s;he &s;hould every &s;ee her again, until they meet in
the region of &s;pirits, as both are much attached to their
own abode.</P>
<P>Quiting the&s;e two curious beings, the Servitor and
&s;queaking Mi&s;s, to thank them&s;elves for the&s;e animadver|&s;ions,
the Editor returns her be&s;t thanks to all, and every
&s;en&s;ible polite young gentleman of the Univer&s;ity. They
re&s;emble, in &s;ome re&s;pects, holy Job, who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eyes

Editor &s;incerely hopes, that they may never be afflicted
as he was; and that tho&s;e of her polite a&s;&s;i&s;ters, who choo&s;e
to marry, may meet with wi&s;er and more pious wives than

This is mentioned to &s;hew, to tho&s;e who believe the in|&s;piration

accepted mo&s;t gratefully his kind offer, and took leave

to want of every exertion of the amiable Dr. Ser|grove,
ma&s;ter of Pembroke College. This produced a de|gree
of intimacy. Mrs. Berkeley, ever wi&s;hing, with little
ability, to benefit all her friends children, took the liberty
to recommend to his attention and protection, a very &s;en|&s;ible,
fine youth of his College, a &s;on of the very worthy
Mr. Andrews, &s;urgeon at Stanmore in Middle&s;ex, one of
fourteen olive-branches to whom this throughly amia|ble
hearted, benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and
kind, and told the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"that it had plea&s;ed him, and
he dared &s;ay would plea&s;e her, that young Andrews had,
on Dr. John&s;on's rooms becoming vacant, earne&s;tly &s;o|licited
to have them a&s;&s;igned to him."</Q> Young Andrews
and his whole family, have as &s;trong under&s;tandings as
Dr. John&s;on. They are famed for it. May he make as
good u&s;e of it as did his predece&s;&s;or in the rooms! This
agreable friend vi&s;ited at Magdalene Lodge three days be|fore
he went to town&mdash;to return, alas! no more&mdash;reque&s;t|ing
Mrs. Berkeley and Mrs. Frin&s;ham earne&s;tly to honour

him, as he politely termed it, by drinking tea, and &s;pend|ing
the evening at the Ma&s;ter's lodgings, &s;aying, he would
invite &s;ome ladies, whom he named, the rector of Lincoln,
and &s;ome other &s;en&s;ible, agreable friends to meet them.
The very tender &s;tate of Mrs. Berkeley's health forced her
to decline it, which &s;he now regrets. He promi&s;ed to vi&s;it

Canterbury Jews. About the year 1785, the &s;hop of a very
re&s;pectable woollen-draper and ma&s;ter-tailor was broke
open, and robbed of goods and money to a large amount.
Every one was at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s who had done the deed,
excepting the worthy &s;ufferer. A gentleman of large for|tune,
of &s;trict integrity, on whom the Editor be&s;towed the
title of RHADAMANTHUS, as apt to &s;ay unplea&s;ant things,
as his &s;weetly amiable &s;on is to utter plea&s;ing ones, thought
proper to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> (the name not recollected by

the hone&s;t man, who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"he <HI>mu&s;t now</HI> find out the burg|larian
at any rate."</Q> He immediately procured a war|rant
to apprehend his journeyman, who had &s;erved a &s;even
years' apprentice&s;hip to him, and behaved him&s;elf in the
mo&s;t exemplary manner. He immediately accu&s;ed his
accomplice, a journeyman hair-dre&s;&s;er. They were both
examined by the Mayor, and committed to pri&s;on. Mr.
Berkeley coming home, the Editor at dinner a&s;ked him
<Q REND="inline">"if he knew this young Jew who had committed the
robbery;"</Q> to which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Poor creature, he had
never committed this, nor probably any other robbery,
if he had not been drawn in by a vile ra&s;cal of a Chri&s;|tian,
as he is by courte&s;y &s;tyled, a villain. It was
<PB N="cccxxviii" REF="340">
moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy
ma&s;ter gave of him, until, he &s;aid, within the&s;e la&s;t few
months, that he became acquainted with this <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
ra&s;cal, when he became idle, and, of cour&s;e, vicious."</Q>
No human being, &s;urely, ever had a greater dread of idle|ne&s;s
than Mr. Monck Berkeley; and often, during the lat|ter
part of his illne&s;s, u&s;ed to exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"What an idle life
I lead! Surely God will, I fear, call me into judgement
for it. I do nothing; I write nothing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley lamented, that, through the &s;tupidity of the
<HI>then</HI> town clerk, the poor creature had not been admitted
to bail. After dinner he retired to his own apartment,
and con&s;ulted his law books. He was to leave Canterbury
very early the next morning, in company with his very
amiable neighbour, William Deedes, Junior, E&s;quire, of
St. Stephen's, Canterbury, both being obliged to keep
term that day at the Temple&mdash;Mr. Deedes, that he might
not idle away a large e&s;tate, which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and
&s;pends mo&s;t worthily; Mr. Berkeley, that he might get
one, as he probably would have done, had it plea&s;ed God
to have ble&s;&s;ed him with health.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock at night Mr. Berkeley came home,
and thus acco&s;ted his Mother: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, you

guineas he will come on to Canterbury. Don't let them
<HI>hackle</HI> with him; for he will not come for a le&s;s fee, and
I know he will come for that; and <HI>I</HI> repeat it, and I de|&s;ire

<P>To prevent her Son's going, Mrs. Berkeley, though with
but an indifferent grace, made the promi&s;e, and after
prayers the family retired. In the morning, a little before
five, the hour the chai&s;e was ordered, Mr. Berkeley crept
into the chamber like a zephyr, that he might not di&s;turb his
<PB N="cccxxx" REF="342">
Father, a very bad &s;leeper, and repeated in his Mother's
ear all &s;he was to &s;ay. The promi&s;e once obtained, he had
no unea&s;ine&s;s on that &s;core. The Editor, after breakfa&s;t,
&s;et off for Be&s;t's Lane, where &s;he witne&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;cene, as

<P>On entering the hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aw affliction per&s;onified in
the figure of a decent middle-aged woman. Mrs. Berke|ley,
conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young

point, telling her who &s;he was, and delivering her Son's
me&s;&s;age, the poor woman exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My God, what

&s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You will be damned.</HI>"</Q> She did, however, re|&s;train
her indignation a little, and joined the &s;upplications
of the wretched Mother, elevated with Mr. Berkeley's
me&s;&s;age into confidence of her poor &s;on's life, now thrown
into the deepe&s;t de&s;pair. Never did the Editor &s;o much
wi&s;h for a large fortune as at that moment, to have given
the mother the fee for the coun&s;el that Mr. Monck Berkeley
&s;o earne&s;tly recommended. After finding all &s;oothing utterly
in vain, &s;he gave a loo&s;e to her indignation, &s;aying every thing
that it &s;ugge&s;ted to her. At length, bidding farewel to this
wretched mourning mother, &s;he returned home, without
deigning to look at the old father. Much it may be &s;up|po&s;ed
<HI>he</HI> felt this. Not &s;o his kind advi&s;er, Mr. Monck
Berkeley. One of the Editor's <HI>minor</HI> puni&s;hments for her
children, when young, until ten or twelve years old, was,
<Q REND="inline">"You have not behaved well, in &s;o, or &s;o; I will not look
at you until to-morrow dinner time."</Q> This was &s;o keenly
felt by her elde&s;t Son, Mr. Monck Berkeley, that he would
often, in the &s;weete&s;t voice, &s;upplicate, <Q REND="inline">"Now do forget
it, and look at me a little."</Q> A proof this, of what the
Editor frequently a&s;&s;erts, <Q REND="inline">"That a little common &s;en&s;e,
and great &s;teadine&s;s, may re&s;cue children from <HI>much</HI> cor|poral

puni&s;hment, and make a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on

<P>Compa&s;&s;ion carried her, &s;ometimes, when taking her
morning walk, to vi&s;it this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Hou&s;e of moarning.</HI>"</Q> This
melancholy affair happened &s;everal weeks before the a&s;&s;izes.
The wretch remained inflexible, and the poor mother in
&s;uch a &s;tate of de&s;pair, as never to wa&s;h her hands or face,
put on or take off her cloaths, &s;itting the whole day without
uttering a word. At length, ju&s;t before the trial was to
come on, &s;ome more powerful orator than Mrs. Berkeley;
probably &s;ome modern TERTULLUS, prevailed on the old
wretch to &s;end and retain Mr. Garrow, who came on from
Maid&s;tone to Canterbury; and, as Mr. Berkeley had fore|told,
got the poor young Jew off for tran&s;portation for life.
Some kind Chri&s;tian neighbour (for &s;he and her children

<P>Dr. Berkeley, on hearing it, as all the city was talking of
it, expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment, that the mind could &s;o &s;oon,
after &s;uch length of time, recover its wanted energy. The

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to omit mentioning here, that, in the

Mr. Patrick Satterley, elde&s;t &s;on of the &s;kilful, &s;ucce&s;sful,
humane Mr. Satterley, &s;urgeon and apothecary, of Ha&s;tings,
for whom Dr. Berkeley had taken a lodging, accidentally, at
a &s;ilver&s;mith's in Palace Street, who&s;e worthy wife was
&s;i&s;ter to the young man re&s;cued from the gallows by Mr.
Berkeley. Mr. Satterley getting a violent fever, and Dr.
Berkeley going to him, they di&s;covered that he was the
father of their brother's benefactor, and immediately declared
that no nur&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, for that they e&s;teemed it their
duty to render every po&s;&s;ibly attention to any friend of that
dear good Mr. Berkeley, who had been the means of
re&s;cuing their poor brother from an ignominious death.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, on going to Ha&s;tings, was told by his
&s;urgeon in town, Mr. Blicke, that he would find a mo&s;t
&s;kilful, attentive, medical man in Mr. Satterley. This
gentleman is famous for re&s;cuing per&s;ons from <Q REND="inline">"the hou&s;e

agreeable friend, the late Reverend Humphrey Henchman,
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Both the&s;e gentle|men

of London. This &s;tory was very frequently told to Mr.
Monck Berkeley by his Mother, during his childhood and
youth, with exhortations to make the &s;ame re&s;olution. Mr.
Berkeley u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever faults I have, I
thank God, and my dear Mother, that I am an <HI>hone&s;t</HI>

<P>In the year 1647, <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Gourdon (as it was then &s;pelt), E&s;quire, was nominated one of the Judges to try the unfortunate King Charles&mdash;he deter|mined to attend&mdash;the mini&s;ter of his pari&s;h u&s;ed many arguments to di&s;&s;uade him, but all in vain.

Mrs. Berkeley, wi&s;hing to &s;horten her walk home
reque&s;ted the good woman to direct her the nearer way in
cro&s;&s;ing the fields. Mrs. Berkeley, not to appear proud,
began enquiring what family &s;he had? The reply made, &s;he
added, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Madam, I have <HI>thrice</HI> known the <HI>&s;orrows of

was remarkably plump and <Q REND="inline">"well favoured;"</Q> perhaps &s;he
may have &s;uffered the &s;ame &s;orrows again. She might,
perhaps, be as great a philo&s;opher as her daughter, who
kept a &s;hop in the next pari&s;h, where Dr. Berkeley's family
bought many odd things, who&s;e daughter, a fine girl of &s;e|venteen,
<PB N="cccxliv" REF="356">
was dying of a con&s;umption. Mrs. Berkeley, one
Sunday, at church, enquired after the young woman. On
hearing there were no hopes of her recovery, &s;he condoled
with the mother, who made the following reply: it is &s;et
down <HI>verbatim.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Good lack-a-day, Madam, why <HI>&s;he</HI> and
<HI>I did not come into the world</HI> at the <HI>&s;ame time;</HI> and why

the&s;e good women mourned the lo&s;s of relatives, as did a
tenant's wife of the late worthy agreeable Capt. Bartlam of
Moore Hall. The day after the death of her hu&s;band Mrs.
Bartlam called to &s;ee her, and began condoling with her,

of the river."</Q> Mr. Hamilton, although an excellent &s;cholar,
was wonderfully fond of hunting, &s;hooting, and fi&s;hing.
Dr. Berkeley, living on the banks of the Thames, had al|ways
a large plea&s;ure-boat of his own, in which Mr. Hamil|ton,
an excellent &s;ailor and rower, was perpetually on the
water, alone, early in the morning, but frequently took Mr.
Monck Berkeley with him. Mrs. Berkeley, dreading his too
volatile agility, feared that, in <HI>attempting</HI> to ASSIST Mr.
Hamilton in &s;ailing or rowing, he might be drowned;
notwith&s;tanding her &s;trong opinion, &s;till retained by the
Editor, although often laughed at by Mr. Hamilton, that
infants, if put into the water, would &s;wim naturally, as
well as puppies, kittens, calves, &amp;c. He often urged her
to <HI>try the experiment</HI> on her own little boy. Mrs. Berkeley
told him &s;he was not an <HI>experimental</HI> philo&s;opher, and was
terribly afraid he might be drowned, with his garments,
<HI>not</HI> provided by nature like kittens, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During Mr. Berkeley's &s;tay at the King's &s;chool, nothing could prevail upon him to &s;wim out of his depth; to the great di&s;content of his mother. One day, after having been &s;ome time at Eton, a young gentleman from Eton came over to &s;ee him; and, happening to relate &s;omething, &s;aid to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"You know he &s;wims as well as you do."</Q>&mdash;To which the Editor re|plied, <Q REND="inline">"That is not at all I &s;uppo&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">O yes, Madam, Berkeley is, I really think, the be&s;t &s;wimmer in the &s;chool. I don't &s;uppo&s;e <HI>any</HI> thing could drown him, but the boat fa&s;tening him in the mud&mdash;he &s;wims like a duck."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley a&s;ked her &s;on, how this came to pa&s;s? he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, they found what a fool I was, &s;o a party of them took me out in a boat, and when we were got into deep water, contrived to throw me overboard, then rowed away; they kindly waited to &s;ee whether I could &s;wim, in order to take me up if I could not. I, horridly frighted, in&s;tantly &s;wam after them, and have &s;wum, as he &s;ays, 'like a duck,' ever &s;ince. I am &s;ure I was much obliged by them;</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"Eton for ever, &s;ay I!"</Q> The Editor had frequently, before her Son was born, heard Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> relate this prac|tice of the Etonians to a new comer; and it actually occa&s;ioned her worrying her Lord out of his <HI>determination</HI> of &s;ending his &s;on to Eton.

The Editor's kindred had always been Etonians and Oxonians. She does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out fooli&s;h <HI>vaut-riens.</HI> Mr. Berkeley, like mo&s;t Eton men, was a very excellent rower, as was mo&s;t happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his father's boat. Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. had gone up the river, to dine at Medenham Abbey&mdash;&s;oon after they had entered the boat to return, a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm of thunder, lightning, and rain came on. Some of the ladies were much terrified; which Mr. Berkeley perceiving, &s;aid to Mr. Wright&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Come, John, give me your oar;"</Q> and the Editor fears to &s;et down in how &s;hort a time Mr. Berkeley, and his father's gardener, formerly a mo&s;t excellent waterman, now an helple&s;s aged alm&s;hou&s;e-man at Maiden|head, rowed eleven miles&mdash;the boat &s;eemed to fly. But Mr. Berkeley exerted him&s;elf &s;o violently, (happily for the party, for, within ten minutes after their landing, the &s;torm became frightfully tremendous indeed,) that he could &s;carce u&s;e his elegant, a&s;toni&s;hingly &s;trong fingers for three days after.&mdash;Mr. Monck Berkeley, and &s;everal of the Monck family, have that &s;ort of fingers which &s;eem as if they have neither &s;inews or bone in them, but, when called into action, feel like iron. The Editor u&s;ed frequently to reque&s;t her &s;on, when he had given her his hand, feeling like peeling &s;attin, to <HI>&s;tiffen</HI> it, which he would in&s;tantly do; and &s;he conceives that no two men, without he cho&s;e it, could have unbent it. Neither his father nor his brother had their fingers &s;o wonderfully formed by nature.</NOTE>. begged Mr.
<PB N="cccxlvi" REF="358">
Hamilton to reject his &s;uit, and leave him on the
terra&s;s. One day, &s;eeing Mr. Hamilton preparing to &s;ail,

he &s;creamed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear Jemmy, pray take me with
you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, I mu&s;t not; your Mamma is afraid
you will be drowned."</Q> Mr. Berkeley immediately
walked into the Thames in his petticoats, being then little
more than three years old, and pur&s;ued the boat. Mr.
Hamilton, in&s;tantly putting back, a&s;ked him, if he was not
afraid of being drowned, as he mu&s;t have been if he had
not put back. The &s;pirited little creature replied, <Q REND="inline">"Aye,
aye; <HI>but I con&s;idered,</HI> before I walked in, that you would
<HI>certainly</HI> come back and take me before the water got up
to my chin, becau&s;e Mamma would have been <HI>&s;o</HI> grieved
if I had been drowned."</Q> The &s;ame &s;ound judgement and
re&s;olute &s;pirit accompanied him through life.</P>
<P>A Scotch gentleman of con&s;equence one day, at St. An|drews,
&s;aid to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I la&s;t night &s;aw your agree|able
Son as <HI>fou</HI> with water as mo&s;t of the company were
with wine."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, who him&s;elf drank nothing
but water, expre&s;&s;ed his wonder at it. Mrs. Berkeley, &s;up|po&s;ing
the gentleman was a dealer in the marvellous, men|tioned
it to her Son in that way; to which he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my dear Madam, it is very true; I am often as
drunk with water as others are with wine; with this,
however very material difference, that when it is pro|po&s;ed
to break bottles, gla&s;&s;es, and burn chairs, tables,
&amp;c. I in&s;tantly become as &s;ober as a judge, and have
&s;ometimes prevented much mi&s;chief."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccxlviii" REF="360">
When Mr. Berkeley entered at the univer&s;ity of St. An|drews,
one of the college officers called upon him to depo|&s;it
a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr.
Berkeley &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline">"as he &s;hould re&s;ide in his Father's
hou&s;e, it was little likely he &s;hould break any windows,
having never, that he remembered, broke one in his
whole life."</Q> He was a&s;&s;ured that he <HI>would</HI> do it at St.
Andrews. He therefore made the depo&s;it; the cau&s;e of
which he &s;ome time after learned. On the ri&s;ing of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;everal of the &s;tudents &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now for the win|dows.
Come, it is time to &s;et off; let us &s;ally forth."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be
done? They, with one voice, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, to break
every window in college."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For what rea&s;on?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh!
no rea&s;on; but that it has always been done from time
immemorial."</Q> Mr. Berkeley &s;edately replied, that he
begged to be excu&s;ed joining the party: having never, when
a <HI>boy</HI> at Eton, and &s;ometimes with more wine in his head than
was good for him, performed &s;uch a <HI>valiant</HI> feat, he &s;hould feel
him&s;elf exceedingly a&s;hamed to be guilty of it as a <HI>young man.</HI>
He &s;poke &s;o &s;en&s;ibly on the &s;ubject, that the practice was
from that time entirely given up, and has probably never
been revived. The money continued to be collected, as the
following little aneodote will &s;hew. A very good kind of man,
formerly coachman at Lord Balcarras's, the College Porter,
was the collector. He one day told a very intimate friend of
Mr. Berkeley's, the young Laird of Kincaldrum, <Q REND="inline">"I am ju&s;t
<PB N="cccxlix" REF="361">
come from a poor &s;tudent indeed. I went for the win|dow
<HI>croon;</HI> he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it,
&s;aying, 'he brought but a croon to keep him all the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, and he had &s;pent &s;ix-pence of it; &s;o I have got
only four and &s;ix-pence.' How he is to live I can't
tell, for they are very poor."</Q> Away flew the amiable
young Laird, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t make a collection for him."</Q>
Among&s;t the &s;tudents he fir&s;t met Mr. Halket, elde&s;t &s;on of
Sir J. Halket, a beloved Scotch friend of Mr. Monck
Berkeley. This charming youth &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Here, take the&s;e
few &s;hillings; it is <HI>all</HI> I have till I hear from home
again."</Q> The young Laird &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Such an one will give
a &s;hilling, and &s;uch an one half a crown; and <HI>I</HI> will <HI>make</HI>
my dear Berkeley give a crown."</Q> The idea of his &s;aying
<HI>make,</HI> diverted the whole univer&s;ity, who all knew Mr.
Berkeley's wonderful liberality to the poor. He &s;oon met
Mr. Berkeley, who not only to&s;&s;ed out the crown, but &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"We will make a <HI>good</HI> collection; go you, Bower, (the
young Laird's name,) to the Scotch, and I to the Eng|li&s;h."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley po&s;ted home, and made his Father,
Mother, and Aunt &s;ub&s;cribe largely, as al&s;o all the Engli&s;h
gentlemen &s;tudents. The &s;ub&s;cription, when clo&s;ed, was
a very noble one. This poor youth was the &s;on of a la|bourer,
who, having <HI>two</HI> fields, about eight miles from
St. Andrews, kept <HI>three</HI> cows; one cow was &s;old to dre&s;s
him for the Univer&s;ity, and put the <HI>lamented</HI> croon in his
pocket, to purcha&s;e coals. All the lower &s;tudents &s;tudy by
<PB N="cccl" REF="362">
fire light. He brought with him a large tub of oatmeal,
and a pot of &s;alted butter, on which he was to &s;ub&s;i&s;t from
the 20th of October until the 20th of May, the &s;pace of
five months, but for this lucky affair of the <HI>croon,</HI> and the
lovely nature of the young Laird of Kincaldrum, as accom|pli&s;hed
as amiable. In what is called in Scotland an <HI>high
dance,</HI> this young gentleman could keep him&s;elf more than
half a minute&mdash;near a minute&mdash;in air. No one, who has
not &s;een a company of Highland &s;oldiers dance, can form
<HI>any</HI> idea of it, more than our great-grand&s;ires could of electri|city
before Dr. Franklin's time.</P>
<P>The very humane worthy college cook agreed with the
young Laird and Mr. Berkeley to provide him a good din|ner
of fle&s;h or fi&s;h through the &s;e&s;&s;ion. The Editor is &s;orry
to &s;ay, &s;ome of his countrymen &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that it was not <HI>quite
roight</HI> of the&s;e young gentlemen to make this &s;ub&s;cription&mdash;they might be made every day."</Q></P>
<P>This brings to the Editor's mind the <HI>indignation</HI> of, &s;he
is very &s;orry to &s;ay, <HI>a Divine,</HI> again&s;t her Son at Ha&s;tings,
for a &s;imilar offence. On the arrival of the three hundred
French clergy, within two days, at Ha&s;tings, Mr. Berkeley
&s;aid to his friend Mr. Grim&s;ton, <Q REND="inline">"It is impo&s;&s;ible to let
the&s;e poor per&s;ecuted &s;trangers &s;tarve in a foreign country;
we mu&s;t try and make a &s;ub&s;cription for them."</Q> Mr.
Grim&s;ton, <HI>jelon &s;on coutume,</HI> to&s;&s;ed down his guinea. Mr.
<PB N="cccli" REF="363">
Monck Berkeley cried, <Q REND="inline">"Stop, &s;top, my dear friend, not
<HI>&s;o</HI> fa&s;t, you will ruin all! No, I will draw up their ca&s;e,
and you and I will &s;et down again&s;t our names half|a-crown
each; half-a-crown cannot di&s;tre&s;s any one who
has any thing to give. We may give as much more as
we plea&s;e, but &s;et down only two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence."</Q>
They accordingly did &s;o, and among&s;t their acquaintance
got many &s;ub&s;cribers. The paper was left at one of the
circulating libraries. The following account was related to
the Editor by a gentleman who was an eye-witne&s;s of the
tran&s;action. The door opened, and a &s;tout man entered,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Who is <HI>this</HI> MR. BERKELEY, that makes him&s;elf

ready to faint with &s;hame. One day, after Mr. Berkeley's

came to Mr. Berkeley in great anxiety, to know whether
it was <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> for <HI>him</HI> to get the Marquis buried in <HI>con|&s;ecrated</HI>

At her return to the inn, relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old Scotch woman, and her dialogue at the grave, Doctor and Mr. Berkeley laughed immoderately. Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed frequently to relate it to his Scotch friends at St. Andrew's. Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, it was treating their dead friends ju&s;t as we treat favourite dead dogs. Mr. Monck Berkeley always made his father's gardener dig an hand&s;ome grave in one of the kitchen gardens, at Cookham, for his dogs; and him&s;elf u&s;ed to plant two ro&s;e|trees of different &s;orts, one at the head, and one at the foot, of their graves, which were always kept nicely turfed; he had wonderful tenderne&s;s, and love|line&s;s in his <HI>nature.</HI> Dr. Berkeley's carriage, on their journey to Scotland, fre|quently overtook, and was overtaken by, the hear&s;e, containing the corp&s;e of the &s;en&s;ible, amiable, well-judging, Lord Robert Kerr, who died at Newberry, in Berk&s;hire, at the age of twenty-eight. His regiment had been quartered at Canterbury &s;ix years before. His una&s;&s;uming manners, a colonel at <HI>twenty-two,</HI> his attachment to the worthy old grey-headed major, always con&s;ulting him in every thing relating to the regiment, endeared him to all who knew him.

<P>Had Mr. Monck Berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his child|hood, they could not have applied to any one <HI>more</HI> likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. When under four years old, playing one morning in the dre&s;&s;ing-room, he, on a &s;udden, flew to his Mother, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!

His &s;kill in mu&s;ic and French, were he not a Divine, mu&s;t have procured him a large &s;alary. His father was a wonderfully fine performer on many in&s;truments; and had the fine&s;t voice al&s;o in preaching and reading, as well as in &s;inging, that the Editor ever heard. Mrs. Berkeley told the young <HI>zealot,</HI> that it was &s;ome poor little infant, that, having died very &s;oon after its birth, had not been baptized. The Editor took care to have all her own babes baptized <HI>within</HI> the hour after their birth, le&s;t a fit &s;hould carry them off. Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s her a&s;toni&s;hment to her mother, that &s;he permitted <HI>her</HI> to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>vale of tears.</HI>"</Q> It could for the fir&s;t part of her life, hardly, with propriety, be &s;tyled &s;uch to her; as, after pu&s;hing forth one &s;hort cry, to <HI>noti&s;y,</HI> as the Scotch phra&s;e it, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;he was in life;</HI>"</Q> as an infant, &s;he <HI>never did cry at all;</HI> which occa&s;ioned a learned <HI>hone&s;t</HI> phy&s;ician's being con&s;ulted, to know whether &s;he had not <HI>&s;ome inward</HI> di&s;order, that prevented her crying, as infants u&s;ually do.

which a little con&s;oled her. The next morning &s;he

The offer was gratefully accepted; and the very able

<P>The very worthy Dr. Lambe, Prebendary of Worce&s;ter,
became Principal of Magdalene Hall not long after Mr.
Berkeley's entering there. He happened to be in the hall
when Dr. Lambe arrived; and mo&s;t of the other mem|bers
were ab&s;ent. Mr. Berkeley in&s;tantly waited on his
new &s;uperior, and with his u&s;ual polite benignity offered
his &s;ervices in every way in which they could be u&s;eful.
The Editor recollects to have heard her Son &s;ay, that,
after certain nece&s;&s;ary things performed, and dinner ended,
the new Principal a&s;ked Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"if they ought not
to go to chapel?"</Q> to which Mr. Berkeley replied in the
affirmative, <HI>if</HI> they could get a reader, and mu&s;ter a con|gregation.
The Editor thinks it was either the com|mencement
or the end of the term, and that there was
only one member in the Hall be&s;ides Mr. Berkeley, who,
<PB N="ccclx" REF="372">
&s;he thinks, was the very worthy amiable, now Reverend,
Mr. Sloman, a beloved, re&s;pected friend of Mr. Berkeley's,
who has frequently delighted the Editor by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that
he conceived he owed his life to Mr. Berkeley, as did
many other gentlemen at the &s;ame time."</Q></P>
<P>A party of gentlemen, many of them members of the
Hall, had agreed, that on the fir&s;t fine day they would &s;ail
down the river &s;ome miles&mdash;the Editor does not recollect
to what place, but thinks it was to God&s;tow Abbey. The
party con&s;i&s;ted of eleven; and Mr. Berkeley, ever delight|ing
to give plea&s;ure to young and old, begged to take with
him a lad, &s;on to a lady, a relation of his Mother's, at
home for the holydays. Accordingly, on Ea&s;ter Monday
they &s;et out; when they had &s;ailed two or three miles,
&s;ome accident happened to the boat; the waterman &s;aw it
coming, and threw him&s;elf out; for which Mr. Berkeley
always, when mentioning it, &s;tyled him a &s;ad villain, add|ing,
<Q REND="inline">"He left the whole number to peri&s;h, for <HI>he</HI> did not
know that any of us could &s;wim."</Q> The boat in&s;tantly
over&s;et; only two of the party could &s;wim, Mr. Pearce,
nephew to the late Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter; and Mr. Monck
Berkeley; being both Eton men, they were good &s;wim|mers,
and &s;oon e&s;caped to &s;hore, when Mr. Pearce
humanely &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, we mu&s;t try to &s;ave them
all. Let us go in in&s;tantly."</Q> To which Mr. Berke|ley
replied, <Q REND="inline">"If we do, we are dead men, Pearce. No,
<PB N="ccclxi" REF="373">
we mu&s;t wait till they are more &s;pent, or they will in|fallibly
cling &s;o fa&s;t, that they will &s;ink us."</Q> This wi&s;e
advice was followed. Mr. Berkeley fir&s;t re&s;cued his little
kin&s;man, as con&s;idering him&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort re&s;pon&s;ible
for him, as a lad of eleven years old, of whom he had
taken the charge. After &s;ome little time, Mr. Pearce and
Mr. Berkeley plunged in, and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God,
brought every one &s;afe on &s;hore. They &s;ent to Oxford for
coaches, and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched
cloaths, Mr. Berkeley immediately wrote to his Mother,
a&s;&s;uring her, that whatever lamentable hi&s;tory the new&s;pa|per
might happen to make of it, by the mercy of God, he
had &s;till the happine&s;s to be able to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf her
dutiful Son, &amp;c. His attentions to the feelings of his
Mother, <Q REND="inline">"for an only Son,"</Q> were ince&s;&s;ant. The Editor
had, from his youth, told Mr. Berkeley, that, if he &s;hould
be expelled from Eton, or get his name entered in the
Black Book at Oxford, &s;he was very &s;ure that &s;he &s;hould
lie down and die of grief, as &s;he and he verily believed
&s;he would have done. He would frequently through life
&s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"If I do &s;o, or &s;o, I &s;hall kill my Mother."</Q> He
is receiving his ble&s;&s;ed reward. It may perhaps be &s;aid,
by tho&s;e who were intimate in the family, that Mrs.
Berkeley was a kind, obliging Mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor bred up by her mother with an aver&s;ion to affectation of <HI>every</HI> &s;ort or kind, and in&s;tilling the &s;ame aver&s;ion into her &s;on; they never compli|mented each other, by the poor humble, now <HI>humbled</HI> title of <HI>Mr.</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Berkeley,</HI> when &s;peaking to each other, or of each other, or to tho&s;e who were acquainted with them; the Editor always telling her Son, that, until <HI>his Fa|ther</HI> had <HI>&s;tood</HI> behind a <HI>counter,</HI> &s;he &s;hould never call him any thing but Berke|ley, or Monck; for, were &s;he to live to &s;ee him Lord Chancellor, his <HI>name</HI> would be Berkeley.

The very grateful father of Mr. Newman, knowing that his father-in-law, the Bi&s;hop, owed all his preferment to Mr. Cherry, and feeling him&s;elf under per&s;onal obligations to that excellent man; from their youth, charged his &s;ons, <Q REND="inline">"as they valued a father's ble&s;&s;ing, never to omit any opportunity that pre&s;ented it&s;elf of rendering every po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice in their power, to the de&s;cendants of Mr. Cherry."</Q> The Editor has frequent occa&s;ion to tell her amiable friends in Newgate Street, that they are re&s;olved to en&s;ure their father and grandfather's ble&s;&s;ing.

A very intimate, beloved, and re&s;pected friend
of Mr. Berkeley, a very brilliant genius, who&s;e Elegy on

declaring to all his friends that he was <HI>extremely ill,</HI>
and in a <HI>very bad way.</HI> On Mr. Berkeley's arrival in town,
every common friend began lamenting the unplea&s;ant &s;itua|tion
of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>he

very well, then; I will cure him, I promi&s;e you, in a

Buildings, to the King's Bench Walks. On entering, the
u&s;ual enquiries of health being made, a <HI>numerous</HI> li&s;t of <HI>ideal</HI>
maladies were mentioned, Mr. Berkeley, a&s;&s;uming a very

&s;olemn countenance, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, I am ex|ceedingly grieved to find you &s;o <HI>very ill.</HI> To be &s;ure,

Up he &s;prang, rang his bell, told his &s;ervant that he mu&s;t
dre&s;s that minute, for that he was going with Mr. Berke|ley
to the Opera. Accordingly Mr. Berkeley e&s;corted him
thither in triumph, to the great joy, and no &s;mall diver&s;ion,
of his <HI>numerous</HI> friends; for he is exceedingly amiable.
The next day, in the Hall, Mr. Berkeley was complimented
on his &s;kill as a <HI>phy&s;ician.</HI> Another very ludicrous anecdote
of Mr. Berkeley's extricating the &s;ame friend from a di&s;a|greeable
&s;ituation, &s;ome time after this, might be related.
It is certain, that Mr. Berkeley, after he grew up a man,
never undertook the management of any difficult affair,
that he did not accompli&s;h it to the &s;atisfaction of all the
parties concerned. Not long after Mr. Monck Berkeley's
arrival at St. Andrew's, he went one afternoon to the &s;hop
of the (to St. Andrew's &s;tudents) well-known Mungo Dick.
To his no &s;mall &s;urprize, it was &s;hut up. He knocked re|peatedly;
at length a neighbour appeared; and Mr. Berke|ley
<PB N="ccclxx" REF="382">
enquired, whether Mungo was broke and run-away.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No

Lord Camden, very politely and hone&s;tly, <HI>flatly</HI> refu&s;ed it in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould rejoice to pay attention to Dr. Berkeley; and for any <HI>Engli&s;hman I will do it.</HI> But I have many years ago &s;worn that I <HI>never</HI> will introduce a Scotchman into any office; for, if <HI>you</HI> introduce <HI>one, he</HI> will contrive &s;ome way or other to intro|duce <HI>forty</HI> more cou&s;ins or friends."</Q> Would James the Fir&s;t have acted by a <HI>Scot,</HI> as good Queen Mary and Queen Anne did by a very worthy relation of theirs, a Mr. Holden, who was many years clerk to old Mr. Cherry, the Coun&s;ellor?

called aloud, and vowed vengeance if he did not leave off
beating her. Mr. Berkeley went the next day, and gave
him <HI>&s;uch</HI> a <HI>lecture,</HI> as prevented his cha&s;tizing her again
during Mr. Berkeley's <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> at St. Andrew's. On the Edi|tor's
a&s;king her Son, if he thought he would mind what

<P>At the age of nineteen, Mr. Berkeley had the honour
of being elected a corre&s;ponding member of the Society of
Antiquaries in Edinburgh, in con&s;equence of a very accu|rate,
&s;en&s;ible account, tran&s;mitted to that Society, of a cu|rious
quarry of marble, di&s;covered &s;ome years ago in the
heart of the Highlands. It had &s;ome curious particularities,
but of what nature they were the Editor does not recol|lect:
probably they were not under&s;tood by <HI>her,</HI> although
&s;o excellently inve&s;tigated and de&s;cribed by her Son. She,
however, means to pre&s;ent that Society with a valuable
antique in her Son's collection.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxii" REF="384">
Mr. Berkeley was a member of the Royal Archers; and
during the war in 1783 a number of Scotch gentlemen of
rank and fa&s;hion formed them&s;elves into a corps. The Editor
thinks they were &s;tyled The Royal Edinburgh Volunteers.
Mr. Berkeley accepted a commi&s;&s;ion. They were &s;um|moned
once, if not more, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in quelling a riot, the
mob being employed in demoli&s;hing &s;ome mills, when
flour was little more than half its pre&s;ent price. This oc|ca&s;ioned
a gentleman's a&s;king Mr. Berkeley if he had
thoughts of going into the army; on which he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; I am much indebted to the wi&s;dom of my Fa|ther,
who would not &s;uffer me to enter on a military or
naval life, when I was a boy leaving Eton. There is but
one thing <HI>now</HI> that can ever make a military man of me,
his Maje&s;ty's erecting his &s;tandard, when I &s;hould feel it
my bounden duty to repair to repair to it."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, in the year 1789, vi&s;ited the, accidentally,
native country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. Berkeley's father was, as well as all his ance&s;tors, born in England. His grandfather, as before mentioned, expended a large fortune in the &s;ervice of King Charles the Fir&s;t, and in remitting money to King Charles the Second and his brothers. The only return was making his &s;on, the Bi&s;hop's father, collector of the port of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in Ireland, a more re&s;pectable po&s;t than in England, noblemen's &s;ons often accepting it.

The atten|tions
Mr. Berkeley received in that kingdom from all ranks
<PB N="ccclxxiii" REF="385">
and degrees mu&s;t have been exceedingly flattering to any

<P>That Mr. Berkeley &s;hould meet with much attention in
the ho&s;pitable polite kingdom of Ireland, celebrated, as
well as her &s;i&s;ter kingdom, for plea&s;ing conduct to &s;trangers,
is not to be much wondered at, his Father having the ho|nour
to be related to many of the noble&s;&s;e of Ireland. His
<PB N="ccclxxiv" REF="386">
gratitude was great for the throughly amiable polite atten|tions
of the excellent Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Water|ford.
His Parents felt it as it merited. The &s;urvivor &s;till
feels it, as &s;he does the very worthy Lord John Beresford's
amiability, for &s;o conde&s;cendingly intere&s;ting him&s;elf in
her intricate affairs in Ireland. She mu&s;t ever retain the
mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of the exqui&s;itely polite conde&s;cen&s;ion of
the excellent Lady I&s;abella Monck, the highly re&s;pected
mother of the Marchione&s;s, ever &s;ince &s;he had the honour
of being connected with her Lady&s;hip by her union with
Dr. Berkeley. That excellent lady once taking leave of the
Editor, on her quitting England, &s;poke as follows: <Q REND="inline">"As
I fear, Madam, that there is little chance of my ever
having it in my power to pay you the re&s;pect that I wi&s;h
to do in Ireland, and that your very great attention to <HI>all</HI>
Dr. Berkeley's relations I am &s;ure demands; I beg that,
if ever you have any relation or friend that vi&s;its Dublin,
you will be plea&s;ed to let me know, that I may at
lea&s;t have the plea&s;ure of paying them the attentions,
that I &s;hould be happy to pay <HI>you</HI> there."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor tru&s;ts that &s;he felt this amiable conduct as it
merited. She availed her&s;elf of this goodne&s;s but once
(it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he would introduce every
country gentleman's daughter of her acquaintance, who,
being &s;mitten with a red coat, followed the camp to Ire|land)
when the &s;en&s;ible, elegant Mi&s;s D'Oyley, daughter

added to her great per&s;onal merits, was de&s;cended from

Mi&s;s Newcombe was hand&s;omer than her ele|gant

<P>On Dean Swift's introducing Mr. (afterwards Bp.) Berkeley
to the then Earl of Berkeley, it was in this &s;ingular way:
<Q REND="inline">"My Lord, here is a fine young gentleman of your family. I
can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, it is a much greater honour to
<HI>you</HI> to be related to him, than it is to him to be related
to you."</Q> The Earl of Berkeley was then Lord High
Admiral of England, the la&s;t nobleman who had that ho|nour,
which &s;ome of his de&s;cendants pleaded as the cau&s;e
of their great pride&mdash;&s;ome of the uncommonly &s;en&s;ible
grand&s;ons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley. A per&s;on,
who&s;e name was not originally Berkeley, one day talking to
one of the mo&s;t amiable of tho&s;e brothers, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My dear
C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, what is the cau&s;e that <HI>you</HI> BERKELEYS are &s;o
<HI>diabolically</HI> proud? Is it becau&s;e, for its great antiquity, no
noble family in <HI>England</HI> has had quite &s;o many h<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ts
and &s;<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ls in it?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Madam, no; it is
becau&s;e we are &s;o horridly poor. We are afraid of being
trampled upon."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Never fear that, my dear C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">;
no man of &s;o ancient, &s;o noble a family as yours has
cau&s;e for &s;uch apprehen&s;ion from per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e, if it
is not <HI>his own</HI> fault."</Q> St. Paul, &s;peaking by the Holy
Spirit to Timothy, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Let no man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</HI>"</Q> It is
therefore <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> in our own power to prevent our being
<PB N="ccclxxxii" REF="394">
<HI>de&s;pi&s;ed.</HI> It is one thing to di&s;like to <HI>hate,</HI> and another to
<HI>de&s;pi&s;e.</HI> The in&s;pired Writer therefore does not &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"let no
man hate thee, or per&s;ecute;"</Q> but <Q REND="inline">"let no man <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI>
thee,"</Q> is a command given from an aged to a young
Bi&s;hop. There are countries where, perhaps, the younger
Prelates might &s;o admoni&s;h the elders to their profit. To
the admoni&s;her of Mr. C. Berkeley, when &s;aying, that no
per&s;ons of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> would de&s;pi&s;e him, &amp;c. might, had he
known it, have retorted the famous Dr. Rock's an&s;wer to
Sir Edward Hol&s;e, Phy&s;ician to his late Maje&s;ty, who,
driving one day down the Strand, was &s;topped by the mob,
li&s;tening to the oratory of Dr. Rock in his gaudy equipage.
Seeing Sir Edward Hul&s;e look out at his chariot window,
he in&s;tantly took a quantity of boxes and vials, gave them
to one of his <HI>belaced</HI> lacqueys, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Give my compli|ments
to Sir Edward; tell him, the&s;e are all I have with
me, but I will &s;end him ten dozen more to-morrow."</Q>
Sir Edward, a&s;toni&s;hed at the me&s;&s;age, and effrontery of
the man, actually took them into his chariot; on which
the mob, with one con&s;ent, all cried out, <Q REND="inline">"See, &s;ee, all
the Doctors, even the King's, <HI>buy</HI> their medicines of him."</Q>
In their youth, they had &s;omewhere been fellow &s;tudents;
Rock, not &s;ucceeding in a regular way, metamorpho&s;ed
him&s;elf into a <HI>Quack.</HI> In the afternoon he waited on Sir
Edward, to beg his pardon for having played him &s;uch a
trick: to which Sir Edward replied, <Q REND="inline">"My old friend, how
can a man of your under&s;tanding conde&s;cend to harangue
<PB N="ccclxxxiii" REF="395">
the populace with &s;uch non&s;en&s;e as you talked to-day.
Why, none but fools li&s;ten to you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my good
friend, <HI>that</HI> is the <HI>very thing.</HI> Do you give <HI>me</HI> the FOOLS
for <HI>my</HI> patients, and you &s;hall have <HI>my free leave</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> the
people of SENSE for <HI>your own.</HI>"</Q> This anecdote of the&s;e
two different Doctors was related to the Editor by a medical
friend of great eminence, who had often heard Sir Edward
Hul&s;e relate it to divert his friends, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I never felt &s;o
like a fool in my life, as when I received the bottles and
boxes from Rock."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt him&s;elf much indebted for numberle&s;s
polite amiable attentions from Lord Durraghmore; for
which he was probably indebted entirely to his <HI>own per&s;onal</HI>
merit, and the great good &s;en&s;e of that young Nobleman,
to whom, &s;hould he chance to read this, it may not per|haps
be unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, what Mr. Berkeley's Father
once &s;aid to the Editor, on her &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"How very lucky
Berkeley is, in becoming acquainted with &s;o many learned
men, &s;o much his &s;uperiors in years and knowledge!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lucky;
to be &s;ure he is <HI>lucky</HI> if you <HI>call it &s;o,</HI> in having
an under&s;tanding that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> make him admired by tho&s;e
who have very &s;uperior under&s;tandings them&s;elves; <HI>that</HI>
is the <HI>luck</HI> of it."</Q> They did not, perhaps, as Mr. Berkeley;
who, having dined out in a large company, at his return
a&s;ked his Mother, if &s;he was acquainted with a young Ba|ronet,
<PB N="ccclxxxiv" REF="396">
whom he named; &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, that &s;he had
known his mother very well."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> am re&s;olved to become acquainted with
him."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e two of the mo&s;t empty fox-hunting
coxcombs I ever met with have been laughing at, and
abu&s;ing him to the company all the afternoon; &s;o <HI>I con|clude</HI>
he is a man of &s;en&s;e and worth."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley al&s;o felt him&s;elf much obliged, as the Edi|tor
does, by the very polite friendly attentions of his Fa|ther's
Honourable relation Sackville Hamilton, E&s;quire, of
Dublin Ca&s;tle. He felt him&s;elf flattered by the attentions
of the learned Reverend William Hamilton, B.D. who
pre&s;ented to him his very curious entertaining work, printed
during Mr. Berkeley's re&s;idence in Ireland. In his return
from Ireland, by the way of Scotland, he made &s;ome little
&s;tay with his amiable old intimate friend, Sir William
Morres, at his &s;eat in the county of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> (name forgot|ten).
He could not contrive to reach the hou&s;e of his
learned friend, Mr. Taylor of Noan. Several tran&s;lations
from the Greek Poets of this gentleman's were publi&s;hed
when he was about nineteen.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxxv" REF="397">
In a letter to his Father, whil&s;t in Ireland, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline">"My Grandfather and Swift are &s;till remembered with gra|titude
in this kingdom; by &s;ome their memory is ve|nerated
as they merited."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley having been always told by his Father,
that Dean Swift was the introducer of his Grandfather when
he came young into England, to the learned and the great,
occa&s;ioned his, from a boy, being a great admirer of that
wonderful man, and his &s;o zealou&s;ly labouring to vindicate
his fame in the Preface to his Literary Relics from &s;ome
horridly fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, and palliating his <HI>&s;ad</HI> conduct to
Stella and Vane&s;&s;a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unle&s;s it is allowed, what the Editor her&s;elf <HI>firmly</HI> believes, from what &s;he learned from Dr. Berkeley's very old beloved friend, Dean Delany&mdash;that both Dean Swift and Mrs. John&s;on were actually the children of Sir William Temple, and the heavy tidings arrived not until the day on which the indi&s;&s;oluble knot was tied. Surely a <HI>Spiritual</HI> Court ought to have power to &s;et &s;uch unfortunate per&s;ons at liberty. Some years ago the elde&s;t &s;on of a gentleman of great e&s;tate was exceedingly in love with an heire&s;s of large fortune: the father threw cold water on it&mdash;the old gentleman per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to give his con&s;ent&mdash;at length, violently urged by his &s;on to find an objection to an accompli&s;hed, beau|tiful, rich heire&s;s, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"You d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d fool, the world is wide enough for you to find a wife, without marrying your own &s;i&s;ter: that young lady is my daughter; therefore give up all thoughts of her."</Q> He did &s;o, and married another lady. The beloved object for ever gone, Mi&s;s <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> married the fir&s;t man of large fortune that her parents recommended to her; but the lo&s;s of her fir&s;t accompli&s;hed lover gave an unfortunate &s;hock to her fine under&s;tanding. She early in life became a widow. The la&s;t time the Editor &s;aw her, there appeared a &s;ort of melancholy re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, that could not fail to di&s;tre&s;s every feeling heart that knew the cau&s;e. This lady had every thing <HI>this</HI> world could furni&s;h, to pro|duce happine&s;s; two fine children, a &s;on and daughter, both magnificently provided for. But &s;he had not the &s;ociety of the only man on earth whom &s;he could love. She &s;aw him happy with another. Had &s;he learned to <HI>feel,</HI> as well as &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,"</Q> it had been happy for her; had &s;he humbly, patiently &s;ubmitted, in&s;tead of &s;adly murmuring, and &s;adly cavilling, as &s;he u&s;ed ala&s;s! to do at &s;ome parts of Scripture. But what piety was it likely &s;hould be in&s;tilled into her mind by her <HI>direfully</HI> ADULTER|OUS MOTHER, who was not &s;u&s;pected until this affair of the match.</NOTE>. Mr. Berkeley was not in England
<PB N="ccclxxxvi" REF="398">
when that book was publi&s;hed; but a copy, by his order
to his book&s;eller, was &s;ent to every member of his family.
On his arrival in England, he immediately paid his duty
at his Father's; and, after dinner one day, &s;aid to his
Mother, that he hoped &s;he had received the Literary Re|lics,
which he had ordered to be &s;ent to her before they
were publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>She replied, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he was much obliged by his attention."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have you redde them, my dear Madam?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure I have, my dear Child."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, and what do you think of my account
of Swift?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, with what her Son u&s;ed to term <Q REND="inline">"one
of <HI>my Mother's wicked</HI> looks,"</Q> replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Son, it
has <HI>determined me,</HI> if ever I &s;hould have a <HI>de&s;perately bad</HI>
cau&s;e to plead, to retain <HI>you</HI> for my Prime Coun&s;el."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxxvii" REF="399">
To which Mr. Berkeley, in a &s;weet melancholy voice,
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, my dear Mother, don't &s;ay &s;o! I have not
defended his wrong conduct: I have only &s;aid all that
my con&s;cience would &s;uffer me to &s;ay in extenuation of
it. You know his kindne&s;s to my Grandfather in his
youth, when he came fir&s;t to England. It grieves me
that you &s;ay that <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be your Prime Coun&s;el."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley &s;hewed his gratitude in another in&s;tance
to Dean Swift. During his &s;hort <HI>&s;&eacute;jour</HI> in Dublin, he di&s;|covered
that the old &s;ervant, Mr. Richard Brinan, in who&s;e
arms Dean Swift expired, was poor as well as aged: he re|lieved
him, and ordered his Father's agent to pay him a
&s;mall &s;um every month, to lighten the <HI>unavoidable</HI> &s;uffer|ings
of old age; which <HI>needs</HI> not the aid of POVERTY, to
render it unplea&s;ant. Dr. Berkeley continued this annuity,
as does the Editor; at lea&s;t, &s;he tru&s;ts, that the poor
man receives it, as &s;he &s;ees it con&s;tantly in her accounts;
&s;he hopes, for his &s;ake, it is not as difficult to get a &s;mall
&s;um paid <HI>in</HI> Ireland, as it is to get <HI>any</HI> &s;um out of it.</P>
<P>It has, perhaps, been before mentioned, that Mr. Berke|ley
re&s;embled his unworthy <HI>Mother</HI> in never forgetting a
favour received, and his lovely <HI>&s;elf</HI> in <HI>never</HI> remembering an
injury done to him&s;elf. Any done to his Father he would not
pardon, as too plainly appeared in his "Siege of Rhodes,"
<PB N="ccclxxxviii" REF="400">
which the Editor never &s;aw until it was printed, or &s;he had
certainly made it a point with her obedient Son; as in another
in&s;tance, where only them&s;elves were concerned, not many
months before his death, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Here I &s;tand, my dear
Madam, ready to obey whatever you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to
command."</Q> The <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> had certainly treated
Dr. Berkeley like a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; and Mr. Berkeley ever now
and then threatened him. Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"The
man that can act as he has done, is beneath your notice;
do not &s;oil your paper with &s;uch a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley
begged him off, on account of his worthy family, with whom
in her youth &s;he had been acquainted. Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed
to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"No man &s;hall maltreat my Father whil&s;t I can hold
a pen, any more than a&s;per&s;e my Mother's fame whil&s;t I
wear a &s;word."</Q> Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed laughingly to tell a
very intimate friend of his, <Q REND="inline">"You are &s;o apt to boa&s;t of being
<HI>will with the ladies of all ages and all de&s;criptions,</HI> that I
am &s;ure the <HI>only</HI> thing that prevents your hinting that <HI>my
Mother is partial to you is, that you know</HI> I would run you
through the body immediately."</Q> Had Mr. Berkeley lived
to read the grateful mention of his Father in the <HI>curious</HI> life
of Bi&s;hop Horne, he had certainly re&s;ented it as it merits
to be re&s;ented. Dr. Berkeley was a too generous friend to
numbers, who&s;e pre&s;ent pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s has quite
obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the
amiable genero&s;ity of Dr. Berkeley long &s;ince re&s;cued them.
<PB N="ccclxxxix" REF="401">
HE is gone to receive his reward: THEY mu&s;t in due time

<P>It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley, in his fir&s;t
nove, "The Generous Ru&s;tic," has &s;hewn his love and gra|titude
to the French friends of his early youth. In his &s;e|cond,
"The Spani&s;h Memoirs," many of the characters are
the real ones of Engli&s;h and Scotch friends and acquaint|ance.
In that of Father Alberto, the reader is made ac|quainted
with the very &s;en&s;ible, highly accompli&s;hed, won|derfully
entertaining, polite, pious, Bi&s;hop Geddes, who
had &s;pent many years as a Bi&s;hop in New Spain, and has
often delighted the Editor, when vi&s;iting at Dr. Berkeley's,
with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate, re&s;pectful
attachment the amiable Peruvians &s;till retain for their Inca
and his royal progeny, &s;upplying him with fi&s;h, veni&s;on, game,
&amp;c.; and the &s;tratagems the Spaniards were obliged to employ
to convey the then Inca from New to Old Spain, where
he is a grandee. His two &s;ons hold con&s;iderable rank in
the King of Spain's guards; they are fine young men,
although one draws a &s;igh over their rever&s;ed fortune.
They are, perhaps, happier to <HI>guard,</HI> than to be <HI>guarded.</HI> The
Editor has often li&s;tened with delight to accounts of conver|&s;ations
related to have pa&s;&s;ed between the Inca and him&s;elf
<HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> in old Spain, al hough the Inca is not a man of
very &s;hining abilities, perhaps, for politic rea&s;ons, very little
<PB N="cccxc" REF="402">
cultivated. He was not dead to what he was, nor to what
he ought to have been.</P>
<P>This excellently wi&s;e, mild Prelate, by the great wi&s;dom of
the then Pontiff, replaced the <HI>flaming</HI> Popi&s;h Bi&s;hop, who
pre&s;ided over the Roman Catholics of Edinburgh, when the
zeal of John Knox's di&s;ciples burned down the chapel, to
the great di&s;tre&s;s of the amiable liberal Dr. Robert&s;on, the
worthy witty Dr. Web&s;ter, father of the excellent Colonel
Web&s;ter, the agreeable Dr. Carlyle, and many other
worthy Scotti&s;h mini&s;ters of Edinburgh. On that occa&s;ion
the zealots of the party exhibited a caricature print, of
which the Editor has a copy, of Dr. John&s;on's beloved
"<HI>Willy Robert&s;on,</HI>" with the triple crown on his head, a
label, &amp;c. &amp;c. May that &s;en&s;ible, agreeable head be now
more &s;uitably crowned!</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding led him to
feel great gratitude for Bi&s;hop Goddes's devoting &s;o much
of his time to Mr. Berkeley when in Edinburgh in vacation
time. He felt that it was conde&s;cen&s;ion in a very learned

cha&s;ed from the door. The Editor hopes that the young

friend of Dr. Berkeley and the Editor. Alas! alas! that
parents would con&s;ider, in their anger again&s;t their perhaps
ill-educated offspring, how will this action appear to me
when I come to lie on my death-bed. God him&s;elf &s;ays,

it from their mind, le&s;t it &s;hould make them melancholy.
This ill-fated young gentleman reached a wretched ale-hou&s;e

pilgrimage. There is a day coming ere long, when the Edi|tor

&s;olemn, pompous uncle, who is well characterized in the

near relatives, whom God has ble&s;&s;ed with under&s;tanding,
had &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e to whom he has not been &s;o
gracious, and con&s;ider that there are very many who want
guardians through life; and the father and mother of a

<P>Mention has been made before, of Mr. Berkeley's being
&s;ent, when he was little more than &s;ix years old, to town,
to get a tooth in&s;pected by that very hone&s;t denti&s;t, the
late Mr. Hemmet, who happened to be out of town.
The amiable friend who took the charge of him &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, we will go to Mr. Beardmore, or &s;ome other emi|nent

his being detained a few days longer in town; and
his wi&s;e kind ho&s;t, fearing that a child, who lived all day
in the open air, might &s;uffer in town, &s;ent him every day
to walk in the Park with his own worthy careful valet de
chambre. This man, happening to be intimate with the
gentleman of the late excellent Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
one day, in returning from the Park, called in Berkeley
Square with Mr. Berkeley in his hand, who, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="cccxciv" REF="406">
went into the &s;teward's or hou&s;ekeeper's room, where his
&s;weetly engaging manners &s;oon &s;o won the hearts of all
pre&s;ent, that they a&s;ked his kind guardian permi&s;&s;ion to
lead him up, to &s;hew him to Lord Berkeley and the excel|lent
Mrs. Anne Egerton. He was introduced as the little
grand&s;on of the great Bi&s;hop Berkeley. His noble relation
was charmed with the great good &s;en&s;e and propriety of
the little man; and, after he had been there a &s;hort time,
his &s;en&s;ible guardian telling him it was time to go home, he
ro&s;e, made a very graceful bow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Berkeley followed the example of his learned Father, who, from the time that his Sons put on the habits of men, u&s;ed, after dinner, to make them practi&s;e, over and over, coming in and going out of a room gracefully, &s;ay|ing, <Q REND="inline">"Every man and woman you &s;ee is a judge of tho&s;e things; therefore learn to do it like gentlemen."</Q> Dr. Berkeley and his &s;on were both very apt &s;cholars; and it has been repeatedly remarked to the Editor, how very gracefully both Dr. and Mr. Berkeley came into a room, as if they had both learned of the &s;ame dancing-ma&s;ter. They had, in fact, learnt of the &s;ame ma&s;ter, the learned Prelate, who was remarkably attentive to the <HI>minutiae</HI> with his Sons, as well as to their Latin, Greek, and letter-writing; always &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Learn to write letters properly on all occa&s;ions. Many people may hear your letters redde, that will never hear you &s;peak <HI>viv&acirc; voce.</HI>"</Q> When Dr. Berkeley was a boy, about eight years old, he worried his Father to let him go out with him to &s;ome Vi&s;itation, for three or four days. The good Prelate not under&s;tanding, with all his learning, the management of boys as well as his Grand&s;on's Mother, and having no mind his little Boy &s;hould accompany him, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, if in the&s;e two days you can make me eight Latin ver&s;es (the Editor thinks it was) you &s;hall go with me"</Q>&mdash;be it what it might, the Prelate knew, or thought he knew, that the poor child <HI>could not</HI> do it.

On his pre&s;enting them, the Bi&s;hop exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, George, you have been too many for me; I did not think it po&s;&s;ible you could have done it; but, as you have done it, I mu&s;t keep my word, and &s;o you mu&s;t go."</Q> The Editor u&s;ed to tell Dr. Berkeley, that "<HI>&s;he</HI> was angry with the Bi&s;hop for being &s;uch an Aegyptian ta&s;k|ma&s;ter to a <HI>poor</HI> little creature; for no mortal in the hou&s;e could a&s;&s;i&s;t him but his father.

Some excellent, aged &s;cholar, (name not recollected,) &s;aid to every one, that Dr. Berkeley's Latin &s;peech, when he was Collector, was the be&s;t he had ever heard during his twenty years re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity.</NOTE> to the Lady, and then

to my Lord, who, untying his pur&s;e, was pre&s;enting him
with five guineas, to buy him a fine hor&s;e, &s;addle, &amp;c.

had a <HI>live</HI> hor&s;e at Cookham. His worthy guardian &s;tepped
up, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t beg your Lord&s;hip to excu&s;e Ma&s;ter
Berkeley. He mu&s;t not take it. His Mamma never
&s;uffers him to take a guinea, or a &s;ix-pence, from <HI>my</HI>

his Grandmother or his Aunt, telling him how <HI>&s;hamefully
mean</HI> it is to accept money from any one but his <HI>own</HI>
Parents, when they are at hand."</Q> This injunction was
withdrawn when Mr. Berkeley went to Eton, near an hun|dred
miles from his Father's hou&s;e; that then, if any old
friend of his family called, and <HI>tipped</HI> him a guinea or two,
he might accept it; as his Father and Mother had often
<HI>tipped</HI> the &s;ons of their friends. He then declined it, telling

his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I don't like it <HI>&s;omehow,</HI> not having been
u&s;ed to it; and John Hayes (his amiable relation) is a
good-natured fellow, and will always lend me a guinea
whenever I a&s;k him, till I &s;ee my Father or John."</Q> A
Gentleman once expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment to Dr. Berkeley,
that, calling at Eton, to &s;ee Mr. Berkeley, he could not
per&s;uade him to accept money.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, having always a dread of her children's
being led to practi&s;e <HI>any</HI> meanne&s;s, of <HI>any</HI> kind, never &s;uf|fered
either of them to receive <HI>any</HI> &s;um, &s;mall or great,
from <HI>any</HI> one but Dr. Berkeley or her&s;elf: from either Pa|rent
they were at <HI>full</HI> liberty to receive as much as ever their
<HI>eloquence</HI> could <HI>extract.</HI> The Editor, from early youth, al|ways
declared, <Q REND="inline">"However well &s;he might like a <HI>&s;mart</HI> cap,
or elegant gown, that &s;he would much rather wear an
old gown, and a ru&s;ty cloak, as &s;he does at pre&s;ent, than
not pay the butcher, baker, &amp;c. every Monday morn|ing."</Q>
The doing that, in the&s;e <HI>ble&s;&s;ed times</HI> of <HI>plenty,</HI> is
hardly &s;ufficient; and &s;uch is the &s;hameful &s;elfi&s;h covetou&s;|ne&s;s

pay after <HI>&s;even</HI> years credit. In Scotland, the traders, al|though
in general the rude&s;t in the world, excepting the
Dutch; if you pay ready money, twenty pounds or thirty
pence, they always throw you back a con&s;iderable di&s;count,
<PB N="cccxcvii" REF="409">

halfpenny worth of white &s;ilk, nicely folded in paper, pre|&s;ented

of Guild Kaye, the fir&s;t &s;hop in St. Andrews, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Be

you with halfpence."</Q> He had been long enough in
England to learn the civility of our traders, not long enough
to learn their cunning, of making tho&s;e who do pay, pay
for tho&s;e who do not. Whil&s;t Dr. Berkeley's family was
at St. Andrews, they were told by &s;everal of their neigh|bours,
that a certain Earl, who has a man&s;ion near Perth,
one day walked in, and purcha&s;ed half a guinea's worth of
tea and &s;ugar, laid down the money on the counter, which
the grocer took, and put into the till. The Earl a&s;ked,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Where is my di&s;count?</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">" Oh! my Lord, I thought your
Lord&s;hip had lived &s;o much in England that you would
not take it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"NOT TAKE IT! I have not lived long
enough in England to learn their FOOLISH cu&s;toms."</Q> This
nobleman is remarkable for a &s;trong under&s;tanding; was
educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter and Chri&s;t Church College, Oxford;
and, being a mo&s;t able &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e, would do the

if he could introduce this wi&s;e Scotti&s;h cu&s;tom South of the

<PB N="cccxcviii" REF="410">
much in England, who con&s;tantly, when he purcha&s;es any
thing, puts the ca&s;h or notes in a paper, writes on it what
it is to pay, and con&s;tantly keeps it in his de&s;k twelve
months, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h traders will not allow him

One day, when the &s;tag took the &s;oil, Mr Cherry in&s;tantly
plunged into a frightfully deep and broad part of the

Now, alas! comes the throughly tragical part of this tale; which the Editor, when young, u&s;ed to tell &s;ome gentlemen, of her friends, &s;he would print, and, to humble the <HI>lords</HI> of the creation, have bound up with "The Hi&s;tory of the EPHESIAN MATRON."&mdash;"LORD, <HI>what is</HI> MAN?" After &s;ome time, poor <HI>wretched</HI> Sir Robert married a beautiful widow, his own near relation, Lady Chri&s;tian Rolle, by whom he had &s;everal children. His fir&s;t, &s;o &s;ingularly lamented lady, left four fine &s;ons, all of whom he bred up gentlemen, to no profe&s;&s;ion. At his death, his very large e&s;tate fell, unavoidably, to his elde&s;t &s;on, who married the very uncommonly &s;en&s;ible lady Elizabeth Anne&s;ly. On opening his will, it appeared that this, what mu&s;t one &s;tyle him?&mdash;<HI>Mon&s;ter of Cruelty</HI> is a milk-and-water title for him&mdash;had bequeathed to his three younger &s;ons of the THUS lamented lady only FIVE HUNDRED pounds each&mdash;Good God!!! and to (the Editor thinks) <HI>&s;ix</HI> children of Lady Chri&s;tian Rolle, each SIX THOUSAND POUNDS.

Another was deprived of his rea&s;on, and never perfectly recovered it, although he lived to po&s;&s;e&s;s, one can hardly &s;ay enjoy, his <HI>horrid</HI> father's great e&s;tate at Hurley, Berks, (now the property of the excellent Duke of Marlborough), after the death of his nephew, the late Robert Gayer, E&s;quire, of Hurley. The third of the&s;e injured &s;ons patiently, re&s;ignedly, &s;unk his five hundred pounds in an an|nuity, and went to board with a farmer at Stoke&mdash;the, at that time well-known, witty Joe Hewett, who was in all the gay parties of the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood.

A writer of romance would certainly marry the agreeable Joe to Nan Fi&s;her. He married a very rich farmer's widow, by whom he had a very worthy agreeable daughter, whom, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the re&s;igned Mr. Gayer would have married.

per&s;onal, I de&s;ire you to let it go to the payment of debts.
This will draw down a ble&s;&s;ing upon what you have left,
and vindicate, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the hone&s;ty <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry's <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> wanted no vindication. A &s;hort time before the death of his father he happened to &s;ee in his father's &s;tudy a book, containing a li&s;t of his debts. He purcha&s;ed one e&s;tate with debts upon it, which he knew, had life been lent him, he had &s;oon wiped off. On the &s;ervant's announcing in the night to Mr. Cherry, that his father was relea&s;ed, three days after the gla&s;s of the chariot was taken out of his head, he &s;aid to his lady, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I am</HI> now thirty thou&s;and pounds in debt; for I am re&s;olved to pay every &s;hilling that my father owed."</Q> So far was quite right, &s;urely; but, alas! he immediately took up his father's bonds, and gave his own. Mr. Cherry's fine judgement certainly failed him here. Almo&s;t every one pre&s;&s;ed on him to be paid imme|diately, knowing, that, &s;hould he have a &s;on born (he had buried two), the e&s;tate was &s;o entailed, that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;old. As it was, with only daughters, they were obliged, after the death of their excellent father, to get an Act of Parliament to &s;ell it. At a meeting of creditors one day at a Judge's cham|bers, the Editor has often heard her mother &s;ay, that Mr. Spinckes, author of "The Sick Man vi&s;ited," one of the creditors, came up to Mrs. Cherry, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It may, perhaps, Madam, be an odd thing for a clergyman to &s;ay; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, that Mr. Cherry was a too hone&s;t man. Why not let us wait, and re|ceive out intere&s;t punctually, as we always had done from old Mr. Cherry?"</Q> The celebrated Mrs. Barbara Porter arre&s;ted Mr. Cherry for her debt of <HI>only two hundred pounds;</HI> for which his grand-daughter, the Editor, always hangs her beautiful &s;mall picture in the &s;tore-room; his other grand-daughter often threatens to hang it in a more ignoble place, the temple of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.

He remained there but a few days; but the Editor has frequently heard her mother &s;ay it co&s;t him above an hundred pounds, for all the noblemen and gentlemen of the county went to vi&s;it him. Mr. Cherry experienced the truth of one text of Scripture on this event. A nephew of his lady, who was under very great pecuniary obligations, as well as a thou&s;and amiable attentions in his youth, begged to be excu&s;ed being bound for Mr. Cherry, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"that he had promi&s;ed his wife, when he married, "that he would never be bound for any one."

The Editor takes this opportunity of making her public acknowledgements to the polite amiable Mr. Hambley of Herts, the pre&s;ent vicar of Cookham, for his very plea&s;ing conduct to Dr. Berkeley, when Dr. Berkeley quitted that lovely &s;pot, and to the Editor &s;ince. Dr. Berkeley always left all unplea&s;ant bu&s;ine&s;s to the Editor, as he always made her open letters that he &s;u&s;pected to be unplea&s;ant.

<P>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley, and his

twenty miles in circumference, there were, at the time of
the Bi&s;hop's re&s;idence there, <HI>no le&s;s</HI> than <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> different
&s;ects in religion, Pre&s;byterians, Bapti&s;ts of various &s;orts, &amp;c.;
and it was cu&s;tomary for &s;trangers to a&s;k their vi&s;itors, <Q REND="inline">"Pray
of what religion are you?"</Q> and di&s;cour&s;e with them on the
&s;ubject of their di&s;&s;ent from the other FIFTEEN. All, how|ever,

<HI>agreeing,</HI> that it was <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to keep <HI>one</HI> day in &s;even

on the Bi&s;hop's making this u&s;ual enquiry, it was &s;ometimes

<P>This account has been confirmed to the Editor by the
very worthy, amiable Samuel John&s;on, E&s;quire, of Connecti|cut,
before mentioned in this Preface, who was a Privy|coun&s;ellor
of Connecticut, the only Church of England-man
that colony had ever elected. He was &s;ent over here, before
we lo&s;t America, to &s;olicit a cau&s;e before his Maje&s;ty's
Privy Council. He was many years here&mdash;about &s;even. His
father, Dr. Samuel John&s;on, a very learned man, an emi|nent
Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter, was convinced by Bi&s;hop Berke|ley's
arguments, and &s;aw the <HI>Divine</HI> right of Epi&s;copacy.
He preached &s;everal Sundays upon it, and at length told
his congregation, that he was &s;o fully convinced of it, that
<PB N="ccccliii" REF="465">
the next Sunday he &s;hould attend Epi&s;copal wor&s;hip, and
wi&s;hed <HI>them all</HI> to accompany him, (which mo&s;t of them
did,) telling them, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>he</HI> &s;hould not PRESUME to mini&s;ter
any longer in things &s;acred, until he had obtained Epi&s;co|pal
ordination;"</Q> which he &s;oon did. He wrote &s;everal very
learned treati&s;es, and a very good Hebrew Grammar. His
excellent &s;on had the degree of LL.D. conferred on him
by the Univer&s;ity of Oxford during his re&s;idence in Eng|land.
He always &s;pent great part of every &s;ummer at Dr.
Berkeley's, and con&s;tantly, until after the breaking out of
the American war, &s;ent over two immen&s;e double barrels
of fine American New-Town pippins, the fine&s;t grow|ing
on Long I&s;land, of which his elder brother was
proprietor.</P>
<P>The Editor u&s;ed to delight all her friends and neighbours
by pre&s;enting them with &s;ome, and her&s;elf by making her
gardener every year &s;ow &s;ome pips in the melon-frame, and
at proper times plant them out. There are now eight fine
trees, thicker than her&s;elf, bearing &s;ix different fruits, only
one of them re&s;embling the parent fruit; one quite through
the colour of an orange, exqui&s;itely finely flavoured for
about &s;ix weeks, when it becomes &s;o nau&s;eou&s;ly &s;weet,
that nothing but her Chine&s;e pigs will eat them; one a
green, &s;trong, &s;our apple, that keeps till May. The Edi|tor
is a great gardener, and made her children &s;uch, telling
her friends, that "when God created man, HE placed him
<PB N="ccccliv" REF="466">
in a <HI>garden,</HI> not in a <HI>hou&s;e.</HI> It was SIN that made an <HI>hou&s;e</HI>
nece&s;&s;ary as well as <HI>cloaths.</HI> The young women now con|trive
to do without cloathing. The Editor wi&s;hes &s;ome
contrivance could be found out for aged matrons to do
without hou&s;es, as rent and TAXES run away with much of
a &s;mall income.</P>
<P>In one thing, however, the different &s;ectari&s;ts, both men
and women, all agreed, viz. in a <HI>rage</HI> for finery, to the
great amu&s;ement of Bi&s;hop Berkeley's two learned, ele|gant
friends, Sir John James, and Richard Dalton, E&s;quire;
the men in flaming &s;carlet coats and wai&s;tcoats, laced and
fringed with the brighte&s;t <HI>glaring yellow.</HI> The <HI>&s;ly</HI> Quakers,
not <HI>venturing</HI> on the&s;e <HI>charming</HI> coats and wai&s;tcoats, yet
loving finery, figured away with plate at their &s;ide-board,
or rather <HI>beaufait.</HI> One, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of Bi|&s;hop
Berkeley, &s;ent to England, and had made on purpo&s;e,
no &s;uch thing being to be found, a noble large tea-pot of
&s;olid gold, and enquired of the Bi&s;hop, when drinking tea
with him, whether <HI>friend</HI> Berkeley had ever &s;een &s;uch a
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>curious</HI> thing?"</Q> On being told that &s;ilver ones were
much in u&s;e in England, but that he had never &s;een a gold
one; Ebenezer replied, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, that was the thing; I was
re&s;olved to have &s;omething <HI>finer</HI> than any body el&s;e. They
&s;ay that the Queen (Queen Caroline) has not got one."</Q>
The Bi&s;hop delighted his ridiculous ho&s;t, by a&s;&s;uring him,
<Q REND="inline">"that his was an unique;"</Q> and very happy it made him.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclv" REF="467">
Oh, the fools! &s;ay rather the knaves! If the Kingdom
of God, as &s;peaks St. Paul, <Q REND="inline">"does not con&s;i&s;t in meat and

wears a coat or gown of one colour or another?</P>
<P>The Editor once met a rich Quaker woman at tea, at
the hou&s;e of a per&s;on of quality in her neighbourhood, and
happened to have on a pair of very fine point ruffles, pur|cha&s;ed
at the time of her marriage, for &s;he loved her chil|dren
too well to buy fine point or lace afterwards. After
tea, the company, as is &s;urely plea&s;ant in &s;ummer, went
out to &s;troll in the garden; when the lady of the hou&s;e called
the attention of the Quaker to the Editor's lace. She
<HI>piou&s;ly</HI> &s;hook her <HI>wi&s;e</HI> head, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I doubt thee bee&s;t

<Q REND="inline">"I hope not: why &s;hould I? I am a gentleman's daughter,

have half the vanity that <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t; for <HI>I</HI> have not once
called the attention of any of the company to my ruffles,
and thou ha&s;t gone to every individual in the room, to
&s;hew them that bauble at thy watch, telling them, it

of &s;hewing a very fine watch; be&s;ides, as that

is a &s;olid pebble, not an egg that opens, to hold &s;ome|thing

gathered round the Lady who exhibited the ruffles, Friend
 <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and Mrs. Berkeley. They all laughed much; and
the poor Quaker &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Thee bee&s;t right; it is of no

<P>Neither Doctor Berkeley nor his Son could ever be per|&s;uaded
by their friends to go to Court, and be pre&s;ented,
without any cau&s;e calling them thither. Both laughed at
the idea of almo&s;t every Country 'Squire, and unpreferred

friend, who often urged him on the &s;ubject, by &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"When his Maje&s;ty <HI>wants</HI> me, he will &s;end for me; he
knows who I am, and where I live: and my curate (that
&s;urely fine&s;t of all fine Preachers, the late pious Mr.

<P>Dr. Berkeley felt gratified by a gentleman of his Ma|je&s;ty's

ab&s;ence for a few days, his Royal Ma&s;ter a&s;ked whither he

Dr. Berkeley was at a very great expence to di&s;per&s;e his
famous Sermon on the thirtieth of January. Only a few
months before his lamented death he printed the &s;ixth edi|tion,
on common paper, and had one thou&s;and of them
di&s;per&s;ed over England. On its fir&s;t publication, it went
through five editions in four weeks. He has repeatedly
told the Editor, that the notes of the fifth edition, in &s;mall
duodecimo, not now to be purcha&s;ed for any &s;um, are all,
except one, an&s;wers to letters, from <Q REND="inline">"Lords and Gentle|men,"</Q>
&s;ome admiring, &s;ome with Nicodemus, enquiring,
<Q REND="inline">"How can the&s;e things be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the third chapter of the Holy Go&s;pel, as recorded by Saint John.</NOTE>?"</Q> To have an&s;wered all the
letters received on that Sermon, he &s;aid, would have taken
a ream of paper. One from the Editor's, not Dr. Berke|ley's,
<HI>old</HI> acquaintance, Soame Jenyns, written a very &s;hort
time before the death of that entertaining, agreeable, great
genius, and, at length, devout Chri&s;tian, is carefully pre|&s;erved
by the Editor, who lately found an odd glove in her
cabinet, that happened to be dropped by a beloved friend
the la&s;t time &s;he ever vi&s;ited her, about twenty years ago.
The Editor has a picture of her friend, and other <HI>&s;ouve|nirs;</HI>
yet the glove is &s;till pre&s;erved with care. Why is it?
perhaps it brings the <HI>la&s;t</HI> idea of the beloved object to the
mind. One knows not why el&s;e. Perhaps the <HI>mind</HI> of

<P>Perhaps two &s;incerer, more di&s;intere&s;ted patriots, have
not exi&s;ted in <HI>any</HI> country, at <HI>any</HI> time, than Bi&s;hop Berke|ley
and his &s;on Dr. Berkeley, both very great politicians.
The Bi&s;hop publicly, his &s;on more quietly, frequently
&s;ugge&s;ted hints to the mini&s;ter for the time being, for
the benefit of the country, &s;ome of which he had the

when the advice was thus conveyed, were generally
anonymous, he u&s;ing to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"If the advice is wi&s;e, a man

<Q REND="inline">"I write frequently to Mr. Pitt, and &s;ometimes &s;end him a

&s;ome additional benefit for the poor common &s;oldiers. The
Editor is no politician&mdash;not that &s;he does not e&s;teem
<HI>females equal</HI> to politics. Sir Robert Walpole u&s;ed to &s;ay,
that an old friend of the Editor's Father, Mrs. Waller,

Ai&s;labie's, had a very &s;uperior under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley was univer&s;ally admired as a letter-wri|ter;
he wrote &s;uch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor fears to &s;et down, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem incredible, during Archbi&s;hop Secker's life, the annual amount of the po&s;tage of Dr. Berkeley's letters&mdash;(the Editor always keeps the letter-accompt &s;eparate, and an heavy enough accompt it is mo&s;t years, even her own now&mdash;when her beloved friends were living, it was &s;ometimes quite frightful)&mdash;and, after his Grace's death, numbers of per&s;ons, who had never &s;een his face, wrote to him to re|que&s;t his advice how to get a place or preferment. He benevolently an&s;wered them all, and generally directed them into a track that led them right. The plan he pur&s;ued was once practi&s;ed <HI>again&s;t</HI> him&s;elf. At the election of the late amiable Lord Lichfield, when &s;tanding for the Chancellor&s;hip of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, during the reign of George the Second, his Lord&s;hip, being an hone&s;t Tory, was likely to be <HI>hard-run.</HI> His Lord&s;hip lamenting one day to a relation of the Editor, the late &s;en&s;ible cynical Richard Rowney, E&s;quire, Fellow of All-Souls College, that he feared Mr. Berkeley, of Chri&s;t College, would not vote for him, a&s;ked if Mr. Powney had any intere&s;t with Dr. Berkeley, ju&s;t then made Vicar of Bray (Ive's Place is in Bray Pari&s;h). The Editor's acute kin&s;man replied, that he could not take the liberty to a&s;k Mr. Berkeley for his vote; but added, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I can put you</HI> in a way to SECURE IT, if you are acquainted with the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury."</Q>&mdash;Lord Lichfield replied, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, in|timately &s;o."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! then, I'll <HI>promi&s;e you</HI> Mr. Berkeley's vote.&mdash;Go <HI>your&s;elf</HI> to Lambeth, and reque&s;t his Grace to <HI>a&s;k</HI> Mr. Berkeley to vote for you."</Q> The advice was exactly followed. The Editor has repeatedly heard Dr. Berke|ley relate to various per&s;ons&mdash;(it happened before &s;he was acquainted with Dr. Berkeley)&mdash;the Archbi&s;hop wrote to Dr. Berkeley (the letter &s;till exi&s;ts); Dr. Berkeley an&s;wered it <HI>per</HI> return of po&s;t, telling his Grace that, according to <HI>one</HI> &s;tatute he had &s;worn to ob&s;erve, Lord Lichfield was not eligible; and, al|though he re&s;pected Lord Lichfield, his con&s;cience would not permit him to vote for him&mdash;that he had always determined not to vote <HI>again&s;t</HI> him; and mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hed he might be elected Chancellor. Soon after Dr. Berkeley went to &s;tay at Lambeth, he told his Grace that &s;uch a &s;tatute &s;aid &s;o and &s;o. His Grace replied, <Q REND="inline">"HAH! I believe it may; but I never under&s;tood it &s;o before. You were (or are) quite right, Sir, in not voting for Lord Lichfield; for, according to that, he is (or was)&mdash;(the Editor forgets whether this conver&s;a|tion was prior, or &s;ub&s;equent, to the election) QUITE RIGHT IN NOT voting for his Lord&s;hip."</Q>&mdash;As the Editor does not read Latin, <HI>&s;he</HI> is no judge of this matter; but &s;he knows it is happy for the poor patients in the Infirmary that his Lord&s;hip was Chancellor.</NOTE> numbers &s;o alertly for his friends and

to be, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;erve, and benefit every one but <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed, by many that knew him through life, in
early life, and until nearly the late&s;t period of life, that
Dr. Berkeley had, by his advice, direction, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
made the fortunes of more men, than any private per&s;on,
not in &s;tation to do it, than any man in the three king|doms,
&s;o as &s;ometimes to occa&s;ion Mrs. Berkeley to &s;ay to
him, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, you can make every man's fortune,

do you not try to get &s;ome appointment for him, to help
him, until he can, at lea&s;t <HI>will</HI> help him&s;elf, by going

Mr. Monck Berkeley, by his Mother's earne&s;t advice to
him in youth, never meddled with politics; &s;he always
telling him, it was time enough if ever he &s;hould be in a
&s;tation to require it. How many creatures &s;tamp them|&s;elves
for fools, by bawling for or again&s;t a party, when
they have hardly left bawling for a good whipping!</P>
<P>A gentleman, many years ago, &s;aid to the Editor,
<Q REND="inline">"What a man Dr. Berkeley is!"</Q> The day before ye&s;|terday,
at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ome public dinner, it was &s;aid, that
an officer, one of the company, was going to Ireland. Some
one a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"if he had many acquaintances in that king|dom."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not one."</Q>&mdash;Dr. Berkeley politely a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"in
what part the Colonel's regiment was quartered?"</Q> and
then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of giving you
two letters, Sir, that perhaps may be of &s;ome little &s;er|vice
to you, although they are very ho&s;pitable in Ireland."</Q>
He called for pen, ink, and paper, twirled his chair round
to a &s;mall table, and in, I think, little more than five mi|nutes,
produced two &s;uch letters to the Colonel, (we all
talking and babbling the whole time,) as I am &s;ure I could
not have written in five hours. <Q REND="inline">"My G-d! what a clever
fellow he is!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Frin&s;ham &s;ometimes, when going into the library,
and &s;eeing half a &s;core letters lying on the table, would &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well! what a pity it was your father did not <HI>put</HI>
<PB N="cccclxvii" REF="479">

To which, as when many per&s;ons have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"How re|markably

<P>Not many days before Dr. Berkeley's lamented death, the

been a mo&s;t zealous preacher of Chri&s;t, not elegant MORAL

which he engraved in the &s;trings of his cre&s;t, as is &s;een in
the print prefixed to the Poems. That Mr. Berkeley, from
his cradle, or rather <HI>no</HI> cradle, as has been before &s;tated,
to his coffin, had numerous hair-breadth e&s;capes from death,
has been mentioned. Some time <HI>after</HI> his death two

<P>The Editor again begs pardon for tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing &s;o long on
the public; and wi&s;hes that &s;he re&s;embled her excellent
Son in many in&s;tances, particularly in burning without
mercy, not, as he did, whole quires at a time of beautiful
E&s;&s;ays, Poems, &amp;c. for in early youth <HI>her manu&s;cripts</HI>
con&s;i&s;ted only of innumerable letters to friends, which &s;he
tru&s;ts they con&s;igned to the flames, and a diary of her own
<HI>very unimportant</HI> life, from the age of &s;eventeen, when,
being a very early ri&s;er in &s;ummer, and her mother never
coming out of her clo&s;et to <HI>breakfa&s;t</HI> until ten o'clock; for
the family prayers at Mr. Frin&s;ham's were (the Editor
<PB N="cccclxix" REF="481">
thinks very inconveniently) not offered up until <HI>after</HI> break|fa&s;t,
when trades-people are coming, and the door mu&s;t
be an&s;wered, in private families&mdash;excepting at the hou&s;e of
the late excellent Mr. and Mrs. Peirce, of Wind&s;or Fore&s;t,
who, either in town or country, never &s;uffered even the
kitchen-maid, or groom, to an&s;wer the door until prayers,
le&s;&s;ons, and p&s;alms, were gone through. At Lambeth
Palace, during Archbi&s;hop Secker's life, every &s;ervant, in|cluding
the <HI>porter,</HI> went into the chapel at nine in the
morning. Dr. Berkeley and the Editor, when re&s;ident at
Acton, were one morning a very few minutes too late&mdash;the
footman di&s;mounted, and knocked violently&mdash;Dr.
Berkeley a&s;&s;ured him it was in vain; &s;o the gla&s;&s;es were drawn
up, and in about half an hour the gates were opened. The
Editor, on her marriage, found the cu&s;tom at Dr. Berkeley's
much better, that of a&s;&s;embling before breakfa&s;t, at nine
o'clock, perhaps not always quite &s;o punctually to a <HI>minute;</HI>
as did, for more than half a century, the pious mother of

<P>Of Mr. Monck Berkeley's genius many of tho&s;e who
read what he has written may be competent judges. To
attempt to do ju&s;tice to the exqui&s;ite amiability, genero&s;ity,
and noblene&s;s of his heart, the wonderful &s;trength and &s;ound|ne&s;s
of his judgement, the brilliancy of his imagination and
ready wit, his wonderful wilfulne&s;s in youth, the great
&s;teadine&s;s of his temper, and the exqui&s;ite loveline&s;s of his
nature, even in very early youth, would fill a &s;mall volume,
which would be an entertaining one, and would require the
<HI>knowledge</HI> of the Writer of this Preface, and the <HI>pen</HI> of
his favourite Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, like the excellent, Honourable Captain
Hamilton, of the Lanca&s;ter man of war, father of the
Marquis of Abercorn, never could behold a cloud of di&s;tre&s;s
on any brow, even on that of a perfect &s;tranger, without
<PB N="ccccxc" REF="502">
not only wi&s;hing, but even endeavouring, to remedy or
alleviate their &s;orrows, in which they both often &s;ucceeded
with high and low; many curious in&s;tances of which might
be related.</P>
<P>Of the excellent, amiable Captain Hamilton, the Editor
has frequently heard his very worthy brother, the Ho|nourable
and Reverend Mr. Hamilton, Canon of Wind&s;or,
relate the following &s;tory, which &s;hall be given in his own
words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My brother was going one day from town, to dine with
&s;everal of his friends at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">'s (name forgotten
by the Editor). It was at the time when We&s;tmin&s;ter
Bridge was either building or repairing. Captain Hamil|ton
got into the great ferry-boat; after having &s;eated
him&s;elf, he ob&s;erved a middle-aged farmer-like man
&s;itting with his arms folded, regardle&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed;
no one, perhaps, but my excellent brother would have
thought of enquiring into the cau&s;e. He &s;poke to him
two or three times. His an&s;wers were as laconic as might
con&s;i&s;t with civility. This only &s;erved to convince my
brother that the man was under &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, which it was
po&s;&s;ible he might alleviate, <HI>if he could but find it out.</HI> Ac|cordingly
he reque&s;ted one of the pa&s;&s;engers to exchange
&s;eats with him. He now placed him&s;elf clo&s;e to the poor
man, and &s;aid, 'My friend, you &s;eem unhappy."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccccxci" REF="503">Farmer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I am &s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Capt. H.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Can I do any thing to relieve you?</Q></P>
<P>Farmer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I thank you.</Q></P>
<P>Capt. H.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Do, my poor friend, tell me your di&s;tre&s;s;
perhaps I may be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t you.</Q></P>
<P>Farmer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, you cannot."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobody but <HI>my brother</HI> would, after this, have per&s;e|vered.
He intreated the man to tell him the cau&s;e of
his di&s;tre&s;s; who began thus:</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Oh! Sir, you are &s;o kind, I mu&s;t tell you. About a
fortnight ago a man came to my hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire,
telling me, that a relation of mine had died very rich,
and left me and my brothers his money, but that I mu&s;t
go to London to &s;ee after it, or we &s;hould lo&s;e it. I took
him in; made him very welcome; and, in a few days,
&s;et out with him for London, mounted on two of my be&s;t
hor&s;es. He &s;aid I mu&s;t carry a pretty good bag of
money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor thinks it was about &pound;70.</NOTE>, ju&s;t to fee the lawyers, and bear my expences in
town. I paid the road all the way up. The morning
after we came to town, he took me to We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,
where we &s;aw a va&s;t many lawyers in black gowns; but
<PB N="ccccxcii" REF="504">
he &s;aid his lawyer was not there that day, and we mu&s;t
go again; but advi&s;ed me, as he was more u&s;ed to Lon|don
than I was, to let him carry the money-bag. We
walked about, a day or two, to look at fine places, and
ye&s;terday we got in one place into a great crowd, and I
lo&s;t him. I have been looking for him, and for the inn
where we lodged, and cannot for the life of me find ei|ther.
I am afraid the man is a rogue, and I &s;hall lo&s;e all
my money; but that I do not value, if I could but have
got my poor hor&s;es; for they are very fine, and worth a
deal of money."</P>
<P>"My brother a&s;ked him, in what part of the town his
inn lay."&mdash;He replied, "That, never having been in
town before, he knew not, nor the &s;ign of the inn, only
that it had <HI>great gates.</HI>'&mdash;My brother &s;aid, 'Well, my
friend, in&s;tead of going to my friends, you and I will go
back to London in the boat, and try to find your inn
and your hor&s;es.'</P>
<P>"The poor man's countenance brightened. They returned,
&s;et out on this benevolent wild-goo&s;e cha&s;e, my brother
charging the man to keep fa&s;t hold of him if they got into
any crowd. Every inn, from Whitehall, quite through the
City, the Strand, and Holborn, was &s;hewn to him. After
&s;ome hours they got into Alder&s;gate Street, at the upper
end of which the poor man exclaimed, 'Oh! God ble&s;s
<PB N="ccccxciii" REF="505">
you, Sir, <HI>this is the inn!</HI>' He flew into the yard, went to
the &s;table, where &s;tood his two fine hor&s;es, which the
&s;harper had not taken away. My brother enquired if he
did not want money to take him home; the hone&s;t man
replied, 'No, God reward you, Sir; luckily I took three
guineas loo&s;e in my pocket, before I gave him the bag to
take care of."</P></Q> </P>
<P>The angelic-hearted Captain Hamilton left his party to
dine without him, and joined them not until the next day.
It is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to add, that, whil&s;t he re&s;ided at
Bear-hill Hou&s;e in Berk&s;hire, he was the idol of all his
neighbours, high and low.&mdash;He enjoyed the <Q REND="inline">"Peace of
God,"</Q> which made him ever chearful, and he had
wonderful good-will towards man. An attempt to de|&s;cribe
the &s;incere lamentations at his early (one mu&s;t
not pre&s;ume to add untimely) death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor cannot forbear to in&s;ert here part of a letter, written at the time, by an old intimate friend of her early youth&mdash;the <HI>learned, benevolent</HI> author <HI>of</HI> "<HI>Chri&s;tianity not founded on argument.</HI>"&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your excellent neighbour, poor Captain Hamilton, got on the keel of the boat three times, and was wa&s;hed off again. He humbly, earne&s;tly, begged the &s;ailors pardon for having brought them into &s;uch peril, told them how merciful God was in granting them that little time to fly to Chri&s;t for mercy. He preached like an Apo&s;tle. Upon my word, Chri&s;tianity <HI>cuts a noble figure</HI> in the hands of &s;uch an hero."</Q> A naval officer, not many months ago, told the Editor what &s;he never heard before, that Captain Hamilton had not been drowned at la&s;t, but that he was pinioned&mdash;he was endeavouring to take off his coat, when the waves wa&s;hed him off the third time. Who can reget that he went to glory in Heaven &s;o many years &s;ooner than by the cour&s;e of nature?</NOTE> would be as vain as
fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccxciv" REF="506">
This excellent man lived to Chri&s;t, was owned by
him in death, and is now rejoicing with him in glory.
Captain Hamilton was convinced, that not every one that
<HI>&s;aith,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Lord!"</Q> &s;hall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
He acted, as well as talked, like a Chri&s;tian, having con|&s;tantly
prayers twice every day on-board his &s;hip; and,
when on land, his family was con&s;tantly a&s;&s;embled as
often. An eminent Divine &s;ays, although Adam's &s;in does,
yet grace does not, run in the veins. Captain Hamilton's
mother was NOT a &s;aint, <HI>i. e. &s;ancta,</HI> like him&s;elf!!!</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's mind, from the time he could articulate,
appeared to be of &s;o very extraordinary and &s;ingular a
turn, as determined his Mother to watch over him with the
utmo&s;t vigilance, during the time that, to u&s;e the language
of the wi&s;e Lord Halifax, in his Advice to his Daughter,
<Q REND="inline">"We are entirely under your government, and indeed
through life you have &s;o much influence over us, that it
behoves us to take the greate&s;t care that you (females)
are well educated."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when grown up, u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline">"Let a man commit whatever he can, except the not being
<PB N="ccccxcv" REF="507">
a good Greek or Latin &s;cholar, my Mother con&s;tantly &s;ays,
That was his Mother's fault, poor young man!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley as con&s;tantly charged the improper beha|viour
of young ladies on the father, <HI>if</HI> he was a man who
had lived in the world. It would be cruel to charge it on a
man entirely devoted to &s;tudy; but there are few &s;uch now
among&s;t per&s;ons of a certain rank in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, from long ob&s;ervation, &s;aw how naturally
youths are attached to the mother, and girls to the father.
The rea&s;on is obvious. The mother is not finding fault
with her Son's &s;lovenly Latin and Greek exerci&s;es; nor the
father of the young lady's monkey-tricks, when &s;he &s;hould
be learning Hi&s;tory, Geography, Drawing, Mu&s;ic, &amp;c. &s;o
much as often to occa&s;ion the late excellent Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,
the bo&s;om-friend from early infancy of the Editor, to &s;ay
<Q REND="inline">"It was impo&s;&s;ible that children, particularly girls, &s;hould
love a mother that did her duty as &s;he ought by them."</Q>
She, as her friend always a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would, expe|rienced
the contrary. Her children, when they grew up,
were lovely, and loved her much. She was indeed lovely; &s;he
has frequently wept with vexation, that &s;he had not the
clam, not to be &s;haken, &s;teadine&s;s of mr. Berkeley's mo|ther.
It was perhaps, according to the old French pro|verb,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Dieu donne la robe &s;elon le froid.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley's
maternal grandfather, with the &s;ame lovely nature as Mr.
<PB N="ccccxcvi" REF="508">
Berkeley had, when a child of only four years and an half
old, on his father's whipping him the third time for wil|fulne&s;s,
re&s;olved, as the Writer of this Preface has often
heard him &s;ay, to tire his father out; and he thought that
about &s;even or eight times would do it. Luckily for him
his mother intreated his father to give it up: to which
he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No; I will whip him till to-morrow morn|ing,
rather than let him get the better of me."</Q> THAT
he thought would be <HI>rather</HI> too long; &s;o in&s;tantly &s;ub|mitted.</P>
<P>It was really entertaining to hear from Mr. Berkeley,
when grown up, his wonderfully deep-laid &s;chemes to
conquer his Mother; but he u&s;ed to add, <Q REND="inline">"I never did
once &s;ucceed; yet &s;till I per&s;evered, till rea&s;on, pretty
early in life, convinced me of my folly."</Q> He would fre|quently
exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! the Wi&s;e King was in&s;pired, when
he gave his le&s;&s;ons for education in the book of Proverbs;
and, ble&s;&s;ed be God, MY Mother had the &s;en&s;e to make
his directions the rule of her conduct. God knows what
would have become of me by the time I had been ten
years old, with my &s;ort of &s;pirit and temper."</Q></P>
<P>From two years old until the la&s;t breath he drew, perhaps
no one ever loved a Mother with &s;uch exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s
as Mr. Berkeley; of which a million of in&s;tances might be
related. Mrs. Berkeley u&s;ed often to &s;ay, on &s;hewing any
<PB N="ccccxcvii" REF="509">
curious thing pre&s;ented to her by Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I am
per&s;uaded, if my Son vi&s;ited any odd place, where no|thing
was to be procured but tanned bulls' hides, he
would &s;ay, Pray pick out the very be&s;t, and &s;end it di|rected
to Mrs. Berkeley, the Oaks, Canterbury."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude to his Father was very great on
&s;everal accounts, particularly on two. Mr. Berkeley from a
child, and through life, was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic lover of mu&s;ic.
Like mo&s;t, he was exceedingly anxious to learn to play the
violin, which his Father early, very wi&s;ely, told him he
<HI>never</HI> &s;hould do; and Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed always to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline">"He was &s;ure, had he learned, it would have been his
de&s;truction."</Q></P>
<P>In the early part of Mr. Berkeley's life, he played on the
German flute; but an hereditary illne&s;s, the a&s;thma, at|tacked
him at the age of about &s;eventeen. The advice of
the very judicious, worthy Dr. Biddle of Wind&s;or, &s;o entirely
cured him, that he never had a &s;econd &s;erious attack. The
Doctor &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley was the younge&s;t patient he
ever attended in that frightful di&s;order."</Q> He bade him
lay a&s;ide his German flute, and charged him never to give
the view halloo. Mr. Berkeley at that time hunted re|gularly
twice a week with the buck-hounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley u&s;ed frequently, at his return on hunting days, to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"There is a fellow, a well-mounted butcher, that I longed to knock down. He &s;eems to <HI>delight</HI> in cro&s;&s;ing the King, &s;o as really &s;ometimes to endanger his Maje&s;ty. <HI>Nothing ever</HI> makes me do it. I wonder what the wretch is made of."</Q> To which Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Why of <HI>bulls' hides,</HI> child, to be &s;ure."</Q> His heart certainly was not ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould with
the amiable, elegant butcher, &s;tanding to repre&s;ent the town of Hythe in par|liament, who&s;e conduct on the hu&s;tings to the Peer that oppo&s;ed him is well known to every Kenti&s;h per&s;on.</NOTE>. He wi&s;ely
obeyed both injunctions.</P>

took out a licence for three men, and his Lady's maid.

not <HI>then</HI> cea&s;ed; but the beauteous young dames were then
differently educated, and <HI>decently</HI> attired.</P>
<P>A few years ago, Mr. Brown taking his ring off to wa&s;h
his fingers after dinner, three ladies hid it from him. For
three days he &s;uppo&s;ed it lo&s;t, and was, as he well might,
exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. They de&s;erved a trip at lea&s;t
<HI>half way</HI> to Botany Bay for their cruelty; &s;ince which he
has never worne it, but keeps the invaluable jewel locked
up, and only &s;hews it to tho&s;e friends who wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;o
noble, &s;o honourable a curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>In one of Mr. Berkeley's idle fits, he was wild to go into
the Army, that he might take a <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> leave of Greek
and Latin; and, by a noble connexion of his Father's, he
had the offer of a Cornetcy in the Oxford Blues. This, at
the age of fifteen, put him into an extacy; and he u&s;ed
all his eloquent rhetoric on his Father to obtain his per|mi&s;&s;ion;
but, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Happily in tho&s;e things
<PB N="dii" REF="514">
my Father was as &s;teady as my Mother in other re&s;pects
where &s;he was concerned."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed to &s;ay to his Son, <Q REND="inline">"If, after you
have left Eton, and &s;pent four years at Oxford, you
wi&s;h, as it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> you may, to go into the army, you
&s;hall have my free con&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley valued an Engli&s;h, <HI>i.e.</HI> not a <HI>foreign</HI> uni|ver&s;ity
education, as highly as did the Editor from the age
of fifteen. <HI>Nothing</HI> could have tempted her to marry a
gentleman who had not pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years either at Oxford,
Cambridge, or Dublin. It certainly infu&s;es &s;omething into
the brains even of the mo&s;t <HI>hair-brained</HI> youths that they
very rarely get el&s;ewhere. Several gentlemen of the
different regiments of cavalry con&s;tantly quartered at Can|terbury
had received that advantage; and Dr. Berkeley,
who &s;ometimes dined at the me&s;s with his military ac|quaintance,
at his return home u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder all
the young men, when they &s;ee the deference paid by
the whole regiment to Captain or Major <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, do not
u&s;e their time of ab&s;ence at the Univer&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, during his re&s;idence in Scotland, accepted a
commi&s;&s;ion in the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers, rai&s;ed to
quell &s;ome riots in the neighbourhood of that city; which
occa&s;ioned a gentleman's a&s;king him, <Q REND="inline">"if he had not &s;ome
<PB N="diii" REF="515">
thoughts of going into the army."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,
my Father's wi&s;dom kept me out when I was an idle boy,
and my own will keep me out now that I am a man.
Nothing but his Maje&s;ty's erecting his &s;tandard will ever
make <HI>me a</HI> military man; in that ca&s;e, I &s;hould feel it
my DUTY to repair to it."</Q></P>
<P>One trait more of Mr. Berkeley's &s;ingular temper &s;hall
&s;uffice. Like all other children, he had been early told,
that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to form a &s;yllable in any
known language without the aid of at lea&s;t one vowel.
It was Mrs. Berkeley's con&s;tant cu&s;tom to go every night,
before &s;he &s;at down to &s;upper, to the <HI>rooms</HI> of her chil|dren
(for &s;he never &s;uffered them to &s;leep together) to &s;ee
if they lay &s;traight, and had clo&s;ed their eyes before they
went to &s;leep, as many eyes are injured by &s;leeping without
this nece&s;&s;ary care. One night, on entering Mr. Berkeley's
room, &s;he &s;aw his fine eyes rolling about, and began to
give him a le&s;&s;on for not going to &s;leep as &s;oon as he went
to bed, at &s;even. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot &s;leep for think|ing"</Q>&mdash;(the mi&s;ery of too many older per&s;ons; it cer|tainly
occa&s;ioned the death of that wonderful genius, the
late agreable, amiable, excellent Mr. Gain&s;borough, Di&s;|&s;enting
Mini&s;ter at Henley upon Thames, elder brother to
the ju&s;tly celebrated painter, Mr. Gain&s;borough of Bath;
but it may be in general avoided by care;) as the Editor

<P>Dr. Berkeley felt much gratitude to the polite Marquis for his very amiable attention, in repeatedly obtaining his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to omit his re&s;idence at Canterbury during the years he was attending his Son at St. Andrew's. The Marquis and Dr. Berkeley were at Chri&s;t Church at the &s;ame time.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Before &s;ix years old he could &s;pell every word in the Engli&s;h

eighth year knew how to introduce them with propriety
when occa&s;ion &s;erved, which rendered his language re|markably
elegant&mdash;not all mono- and di&s;-&s;yllables, as is
often the ca&s;e with children, in&s;omuch as to make the

<P>The next day Mrs. Berkeley, pa&s;&s;ing through the hall,

(He continued it for his beloved Mr. Monck Berkeley.) One of which jokes was a ring at the front gate, ju&s;t as it was du&s;k, to make Dr. Berkeley believe that his dear Jem|my Hamilton was arrived, as Mr. Hamilton never fixed the day.

This brings to the Editor's remembrance a dialogue that
many years ago pa&s;&s;ed between the late King George the
Second and the French Amba&s;&s;ador at Herenhau&s;en, one
day at dinner, when a relation of the Editor, the late Ri|chard
Powney, E&s;quire, Fellow of All Souls College, had
the honour to dine with his Maje&s;ty, who, when abroad,
laid a&s;ide royalty, and wi&s;hed his gue&s;ts to forget that he
was a King.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador, a lively man, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"YOU poor Kings ne|ver

<P>Mr. Powney, who entertained a table full of company at
Dr. Berkeley's with this anecdote, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Every one ad|mired
the ready wit of the King;"</Q> and all the company
laughed heartily.</P>

&s;he recollects hearing her Son &s;ay that &s;he had been there
&s;ome days.</P>
<P>This order was &s;o urgent, that the Prince&s;s only &s;tayed in
Canterbury to change hor&s;es for Dover, at three in the
morning. At eight Mr. Monck Berkeley's letter, men|tioned
above as to be received from the fair hands of the
beauteous Prince&s;s, was brought to the Oaks by the hone&s;t
ho&s;tler of the Lyon, and delivered with <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mrs. Lambelle's</HI> be&s;t

<P>The Prince&s;s's degradation by the hone&s;t ho&s;tler afforded

When la&s;t at Canterbury, the Editor reque&s;ted her wor|thy

that lovely &s;pot. Le&s;t it &s;hould have &s;lipped that lady's me|mory,

<Q REND="inline">"You bade me draw the character of your &s;ucce&s;&s;or (at

&s;eems to have much of the Lamb in his nature and man|ners,

a character.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"What could <HI>Mrs.</HI> Berkeley have to
do with dilapidations during the life of Dr. Berkeley?"</Q>
She has, alas! had <HI>too</HI> much to do with them &s;ince his
lamented death. Dr. Berkeley never took dilapidations,
but at Acton a very trifle, and at Canterbury not forty
pounds, and immediately expended on the Prebendal Hou&s;e
<PB N="dxx" REF="534">
more than two hundred pounds. The Editor a&s;ked him how
he came to take any, as he never had before, and Dr. Sted|man
did not die rich; he &s;weetly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I had
not you here to remind me not to do it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed always, from the time he married, to
leave all bu&s;ine&s;s that he thought might have any thing at
all unplea&s;ant in it to Mrs. Berkeley, laughingly &s;aying.
<Q REND="inline">"it was the plea&s;ante&s;t thing in the world to have a wife,

<P>Beer is generally &s;poiled <HI>by</HI> hops; and the Editor has

few per&s;ons who fully know the whole&s;omene&s;s of aged

Mr. Gurney, had not a boy ill, which <HI>he</HI> attributed en|tirely,
under God, to their drinking very hard <HI>home-brewed</HI>
beer. He brewed, as they do in all <HI>wi&s;e</HI> gentlemen's fami|lies,
only twice in the year, in March and October. All
the world have of late found out the virtues of beer without
hops. New, or as it is commonly called &s;weet-wort, is ex|cellent
<PB N="dxxii" REF="536">
for worms in children, and for &s;curvies in men;
and when the poi&s;on of the &s;trong rank weed, hop, is gone

vinegar; but a table &s;poonful of &s;tale brewer's beer is

<P>The lady, however, begged excu&s;e, went, and did her

a gentleman, that within two years he would break out a

<P>The Editor now experiences the want of a back <HI>gate</HI> at

<P>The Editor, perhaps, (having de&s;cribed her&s;elf as the <HI>mo&s;t

her doll, to put it into the cradle, in an arbore at the far|the&s;t
part of a very long walk, her mother called her: thus
<HI>importantly</HI> occupied, &s;he, conceiving that it could not be

heard, uttered the following &s;oliloquy, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I won't come till I

had taken care of here from a month old, (for, thank God,
her mother was her nur&s;e,) with <Q REND="inline">"Oh! <HI>fie,</HI> Mi&s;s, how came

<P>The little culprit was delivered to her mother, &s;tanding at

of her mother's from town; which &s;he had contrived to get
&s;ight of half a dozen times during the morning, and was
told &s;he was to wear it in the afternoon to go vi&s;it Mi&s;s
Sloper, &s;i&s;ter of General Sir Robert Sloper; Mr. and Mrs. Slo|per
then lived at Waltham Place. (This young lady died at
Mrs. Dennis's &s;chool.) Whether elated by &s;o frequently
contemplating the <HI>beautiful</HI> bonnet, or in what el&s;e &s;he of|fended,
whether by flying up one pair of &s;tairs and down
the other of the old hou&s;e, a favourite amu&s;ement with both
&s;i&s;ters when their <HI>Mother</HI> was out of the hou&s;e. Be this,
<PB N="dxxvii" REF="541">
however, as it may, the culprit was called, well-jobed, and
told, that in&s;tead of going out vi&s;iting in the new bonnet,
&s;he was to &s;tay at home tied by the arm to, &s;he believes, the
fir&s;t fly-table ever made in England, made according to Mrs.
Frin&s;ham's own directions given to a country cabinet-maker,
and which &s;he (the culprit) could have drawn all over
the hou&s;e. She &s;upplicated for pardon, but in vain;
&s;he was made to &s;it down on the floor under the table,
tied by the left arm. She was tied with a good long nee|dleful
of common white &s;ilk, taken from a ball in her
mother's Indian work-bowl. She wept much a little while,
but, being naturally of a very cheerful di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oon
dried her eyes, and began to amu&s;e her&s;elf with &s;cratching
a tree and &s;ome flowers on the &s;hining old oak floor, with
a large pin that &s;he had coaxed out of her frock behind.</P>
<P>The Editor's delight in drawing and mixing colours com|menced,
&s;he remembers, before &s;he left off her back|&s;tring.
Thus amu&s;ed, &s;he <HI>forgot</HI> that &s;he was a pri&s;oner,
and had crawled quite to the &s;tretch of her tether. On
finding it, &s;he was in &s;uch terror le&s;t the &s;ilk &s;hould break,
and that her mother &s;hould think that &s;he had dared to li|berate
her&s;elf, that &s;he crept &s;o clo&s;e to the leg of the table
as to let the &s;ilk hang in a loop for con&s;iderably more than
an hour, not amu&s;ing her&s;elf in any way but the delight
ari&s;ing from her happine&s;s that the &s;ilk had <HI>not</HI> broke.</P>
<P><PB N="dxxviii" REF="542">
It may perhaps, by &s;ome, be thought &s;trange, that a <HI>very</HI>
docile girl &s;hould make &s;o very re&s;olute a mother. Her
di&s;po&s;ition is naturally yielding, except when duty called
for &s;teadine&s;s, as in the ca&s;e of Mr. Berkeley. His brother
was as ea&s;ily governed as his Mother.</P>
<P>The Editor had the happine&s;s, &s;he &s;till feels it &s;uch, that
her mother bore te&s;timony to the amenablene&s;s of her
temper a very few months before her <Q REND="inline">"&s;low &s;udden death."</Q>
A beloved friend of the Editor was &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erting,
<Q REND="inline">"that every human being was <HI>&s;tubborn,</HI> and would, if <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI>
get their own will; that nothing but &s;uperior ab&s;olute
force prevented it;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hew me any man,

this <HI>rara avis.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed the doctrine of <HI>univer&s;al
&s;tubbornne&s;s,</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted, that, although &s;he had MANY
faults, &s;he was certainly not a <HI>wilful</HI> being; and re&s;pectfully
reque&s;ted her mother to &s;ay whether &s;he thought <HI>her</HI> &s;o.
Mrs. Frin&s;ham laid down her work, and, lifting up her
&s;weet eyes, which exactly re&s;embled Dr. Berkeley's, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! no, my dear, indeed you <HI>are not</HI> &s;tubborn; you
never gave me five minutes trouble in your life from
<HI>wilfulne&s;s.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxxix" REF="543">
The mentioning of the&s;e things brings to the Editor's
recollection a conver&s;ation with her Son not many months
before his death, telling a friend, who had a violent-tem|pered
little boy, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;he &s;hould contrive to prevent his
crying and &s;creaming &s;o violently as de&s;cribed, as it was
dangerous, and often productive of bad con&s;equences to

it with her own boys; that when &s;he had locked
them into a light room, (no child &s;hould ever be &s;hut

you, <HI>could</HI> you think that I was fool enough to &s;cream a

I &s;trained my lungs that you might hear as long as I

had often ob&s;erved that the la&s;t &s;hout was the mo&s;t violent.)
"I then immediately reached down &s;ome book, (the pri&s;on

The Editor, on peru&s;ing the &s;heets quite ready for pub|lication,
finds that &s;he has omitted many anecdotes that
mu&s;t have heightened the ideas of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
wi&s;dom and amiability, and his undaunted courage. His
re&s;cuing a poor little child late one night near Covent Gar|den,

<P>The Editor rejoices very &s;incerely, that PROVIDENCE

his father, as &s;en&s;ible as his mother!</P>
<P>The Editor, on peru&s;ing the &s;heets of this wonderfully
long Preface <HI>de &s;uite tout en&s;emble</HI> is hurt to find, that her
memory is become &s;o treacherous as to have permitted her
to be &s;o guilty of tautology, at the di&s;tance of little more
than &s;ix months, to have twice quoted &s;ome favourite lines
of Mr. Addi&s;on. This, however, may be pardoned, for
they are beautiful, and &s;he repeats the hymn of which they
form a part every day; but repeating her own remarks or
comments &s;he laments, as &s;he does her <HI>&s;eeming</HI> ingratitude,
when, mentioning the amiable ho&s;pitality of Scotland, &s;he
perceives &s;he has omitted to mention the very highly polite
attentions received by Dr. Berkeley's family, from the very
elegant &s;i&s;ter of the worthy Lord Newark, re&s;ident at St.
Andrew's when Dr. Berkeley's family went to re&s;ide there;
<Q REND="inline">"although la&s;t, yet not lea&s;t,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A lady, the other day, &s;aid to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"that our

The Editor has not the honour to be known at pre&s;ent
to many Noble&s;&s;e,
<Q>"<HI>The world forgetting, by the world forgot;</HI>"</Q> but &s;he is apt to think that <HI>modern</HI> Nobility are addicted to
&s;et more value on a coronet than tho&s;e to whom it has de|&s;cended
by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion through &s;everal genera|tions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley &s;ome years ago had the honour to cor|re&s;pond
with &s;ome Engli&s;h Nobles of both &s;exes, now no
more. Very many of their letters are pre&s;erved&mdash;as polite
as if <HI>&s;he</HI> had been noble.</P>
<P>Several years ago the Editor took leave to write to a
modern Peere&s;s, reque&s;ting a very &s;mall favour for a young
lady, <HI>very very</HI> much Mrs. Berkeley's &s;uperior, not to &s;ay by
birth the Peere&s;s's. The an&s;wer was returned on an half-&s;heet
of common paper, &s;ealed with a wafer pricked with a pin,
expre&s;&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment that the Editor could &s;uppo&s;e &s;he
could do what &s;he reque&s;ted,&mdash;u&s;e her intere&s;t to procure
a vacant twenty pounds <HI>per annum</HI> for a poor lady, who
mu&s;t have had the PAS of the Peere&s;s until her Lord was
a few years ago created a Peer. What made it <HI>&s;till &s;tranger</HI>
to the <HI>poor &s;imple</HI> Editor was, that when the Peere&s;s and
her&s;elf were both girls, the Peere&s;s's lovely mother felt,
at lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf (&s;he had the grace of humility)
<PB N="dxxxiv" REF="548">
obliged by the Editor's mother's attentions to her and her
little girl, now the <HI>little</HI> Peere&s;s. This occured not long
after the Editor's return to England, and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed
that &s;ome great revolution in politene&s;s had taken place
during her ab&s;ence, and that poor untitled gentry mu&s;t
approach Nobility as Swift makes the &s;ubjects of Japan
approach their Emperor, and <Q REND="inline">"lick the du&s;t as they crawl
towards him."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor's ideas concerning a revolution in manners
were, however, &s;oon corrected, by her having the honour
to receive letters <HI>&agrave; l'&eacute;garde de &s;on cher fils</HI> from her amiable
friend, Lord Loughborouh. An in&s;tance of his Lord&s;hip's
amiability, related to her by another old friend, the agree|able
Mr. Berridge, the ho&s;pitable ma&s;ter of John &agrave; Gaunt's
Ca&s;tle, emboldened her, at the di&s;tance of near a quarter
of a century, to write to his Lord&s;hip to introduce that
dear young man, telling his Lord&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"that naturali&s;ts a&s;|&s;ure
us, that the mo&s;t timid animals become courageous
where their young are concerned, that &s;he felt the truth
of the a&s;&s;ertion."</Q> His Lord&s;hip's, and good Lady Lough|borough's
attentions are carefully regi&s;tered in her grateful
memory. His Lord&s;hip's an&s;wer was mo&s;t polite and
friendly. Their amiable Graces of Marlborough, and the
late excellent Lady Effingham, who have chanced to
honour the Editor with letters, have written on <HI>whole</HI> &s;heets
of gilt paper, mo&s;t conde&s;cendingly &s;ub&s;cribed, and &s;ealed
<PB N="dxxxv" REF="549">
&mdash;as to a gentlewoman&mdash;not to be mantua-maker. Indeed
the Editor u&s;ed to write more re&s;pectfully to the famous
Mrs. Munday, her old playfellow, niece of John Breedon,
E&s;quire, of Bear-Court, Berks, when &s;he wanted a new
<HI>n&eacute;glig&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P>The poor lady for whom the Editor &s;upplicated the
Peere&s;s's intere&s;t, for only a poor vacant twenty pounds <HI>per
annum,</HI> has the honour, at lea&s;t her grandfather had, and
upwards for <HI>very many</HI> centuries, the honour to have two
crowned heads, put on mourning at their decea&s;e, (as,
whil&s;t there was a King in France, was always done by that
King when the head of the Courtney family died,) which
the Editor is <HI>very</HI> &s;ure no crowned head ever did for <HI>her</HI> an|ce&s;tors,
nor, as &s;he verily believes, for tho&s;e of Captain <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, father of the Peere&s;s. The poor young lady
&s;hewed her high birth, by &s;ubmitting with, the Editor really
thinks, unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity,
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which an imprudent match, in <HI>very</HI>
early youth, had unavoidably &s;ubjected her&s;elf, her elegant
hu&s;band, and lovely little girl. Although Mrs. Berkeley
failed to obtain relief from the <HI>courtly,</HI> COURTEOUS <HI>Peere&s;s,</HI>
the amiable Dr. Berkeley's pocket failed not to alleviate
their <HI>deep</HI> di&s;tre&s;s; for which the young gentleman ble&s;&s;ed
him when dying. His &s;en&s;ible, grateful relict and lovely
daughter continue to ble&s;s his &s;weet memory. Dr. Berke|ley

<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, a great herald from ten years old,
was con&s;ulted at twenty-two by a noble, amiable Peer, a
great herald, a friend of the Peere&s;s's Lord elect, about
&s;upporters to be added when the arms of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> were to
be <HI>tipped</HI> with a coronet. Mentioning the &s;election Mr.
Monck Berkeley fir&s;t made would too plainly mark out the
Peere&s;s, who, it is hoped, although &s;he is now turned three|&s;core,
may live to grow older&mdash;and wi&s;er. The Editor ne|ver
wi&s;hes <Q REND="inline">"her pocket cat-o-nine tails"</Q> to <HI>wound</HI> any but
the vicious and the ungrateful, and only to make the <HI>in&s;olent
tingle</HI> a little. The Editor has &s;ome letters, which &s;he pre|&s;erves,
from ancient <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> male and female, for their in|ternal
as well as their external merit. The a&s;&s;umed motto
of the excellent Counte&s;s of L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, round her Lady|&s;hips
cipher-&s;eal, is always carefully pre&s;erved; <Q REND="inline">"HOLINESS

<P>The two following letters of the late George-Monck
Berkeley, E&s;quire, were written at different periods; the
fir&s;t, when he was ju&s;t about to return from his <HI>la&s;t</HI> vi&s;t to

then, once in three or four years, in &s;ummer vacation,
make a vi&s;it to Scotland for a few weeks."</Q> Although an

&s;o readily affords to all its &s;uffering &s;ubjects. This

Some years ago the Editor was applied to, by the

After repeated applications to Dr. Berkeley to <HI>make</HI> the
Editor tell, and her Son's a&s;&s;uring her that, if &s;he did not tell
them, they would &s;ummon her into We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall,
&s;he wrote <HI>a</HI> letter that &s;cared, yet diverted her beloved

<P>The letter given us by Mr. Walpole, &s;igned, ANNE DOR|SET,

<HI>water,</HI> compared with the Editor's. She pre&s;erves the
copy (a rare thing with her to make or take one) in an ele|gant
box, for the <HI>amazement</HI> of an old friend or two, who
<HI>admire</HI> the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the Editor, who tru&s;ts that &s;he attends

but her friends or her neighbours.</P>
<P>Many arguments were u&s;ed, by Dr. Berkeley. and her
Son, to <HI>blunt</HI> the &s;entences of this letter, but all in vain;
and Mr. Monck Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, if my Mother
<HI>will not</HI> write another, this will prevent her being called

<P>The Editor, naturally rather a coward, was once very
near being murdered, at lea&s;t knocked down, a tremendous
thing to befal a poor little female. One morning in winter,
(the Editor never wa&s;tes the <HI>&s;ummer</HI> mornings in walking)
returning from her morning walk at Canterbury, pa&s;&s;ing
through the Cloi&s;ters, there i&s;&s;ued from the dark chapel,
called St. Mary in Criptis, violent blows&mdash;on a nearer ap|proach,
dreadful groans, On turning to look into it, the
following words were heard, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I am old and feeble,
you take this time to abu&s;e me, when all the men are
gone off to dinner."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you old dog, I'll do for you,
I <HI>promi&s;e</HI> you."</Q> The Editor, much nimbler than at pre|&s;ent,
flew in, and there &s;aw a &s;turdy young villain giving &s;uch
<PB N="dl" REF="564">
blows as &s;he never &s;aw before, and hopes never to &s;ee
again, to a poor, old, &s;ilver-haired man. She called out,
<Q REND="inline">"You wretch, leave off: how dare you beat the poor old
man in this &s;hocking manner?"</Q> He in&s;tantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"I'll beat him to death, what bu&s;ine&s;s is it of yours? <HI>I'll
teach you to</HI> meddle:"</Q> and, clenching his fi&s;t, advanced,
&s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Who are you? I'll teach you <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who

<P>The Editor never felt plea&s;ure before from Dr. Berkeley's
<HI>local</HI> dignities; on this occa&s;ion, it made her happy. The
Mon&s;te turned as pale as death, flew by her, and was quite
out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant. She took the poor old man
home to her hou&s;e, and de&s;ired her careful, compa&s;&s;ionate
&s;ervants to &s;ee to him, and give him &s;ome wine, &amp;c. to com|fort
him.</P>
<P>The Editor feels it incumbent on her to declare, that,
from the age of about &s;eventeen, when &s;he began to con&s;i|der
&s;eriou&s;ly, that Time is a point, Eternity A NEVER-END|ING
circle; that &s;he re&s;olved to endeavour to di&s;charge the
relative duties of life, as &s;he felt &s;he &s;hould wi&s;h at the
<HI>aweful</HI> hour of death, as a daughter, a &s;i&s;ter, a friend, a
mi&s;tre&s;s, a neighbour, a wife, and a mother.</P>
<P><PB N="dli" REF="565">
As a daughter, the extremely tender attachment &s;he
felt for her mother from childhood, added to gratitude
for a very liberal expen&s;ive education, rendered the &s;tu|dying
to obey and delight her a <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> ta&s;k.</P>
<P>As a &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Berkeley owned much, for the <HI>tendere&s;t</HI>
love; and never had, when a girl, the lea&s;t idea of acting in
character of <HI>elde&s;t</HI> &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he ever reprobated.&mdash;The idea
of brothers and &s;i&s;ters being ANGRY at an imprudent match
is to her wonderful; they may be grieved. Had the Edi|tor's
&s;i&s;ter, who <HI>early</HI> in life re&s;olved never to marry any man,
as &s;he told a friend &s;ome little time ago, cho&s;en to unite
here&s;elf with a chimney-&s;weeper; the Editor would have
kept up friend&s;hip with her &s;i&s;ter, and civility with the
<HI>quondam</HI> SWEEP. The Editor conceives that the authority
of PARENTS is not meant by God to extend to <HI>children</HI> of
twenty-five, thirty, or <HI>forty</HI> years old.</P>
<P>As a friend, the Editor is certain &s;he was faithful and
&s;ecret; &s;he con&s;tantly laboured to be agreeable; and &s;he
tru&s;ts &s;he was obliging and complying. It is a little re|markable,
that almo&s;t quite entire &s;trangers to the Editor
have reque&s;ted to depo&s;ite important &s;ecrets to her keeping.
She never could conceive the rea&s;on. She indeed has been
told, by more than one phy&s;iognomi&s;t, that the lines of
hone&s;ty are &s;trongly marked in her countenance. She never
wi&s;hed to know a &s;ecret, le&s;t, as &s;he u&s;ed jokingly to &s;ay, &s;he

Mrs. Berkeley was of too little importance in the world, to
benefit any one much: however, finding that although &s;he
could <HI>not</HI> get money <HI>out</HI> of the Auditor's hands, eleven
pounds, until &s;he had proved Dr. Berkeley's will, &s;he
could not po&s;&s;ibly get any into the hands of the worthy ge|nerous

<P>The Editor feels that, had not her Parents be&s;towed the

could have loved them living, or re&s;pected their memory; if
<HI>&s;he</HI> did not profit by it, the fault was <HI>her own.</HI> Mr. Monck
Berkeley was quite of his mother's mind. A rather di|verting
anecdote, &s;hewing Mr. Monck Berkeley's ideas
concerning education when a boy, is here &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>The very grateful agreeable Mr. Ta&s;well, Rector of
Ayl&s;ham, in Norfolk, wrote to Dr. Berkeley, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"That
he meant to wait on him for two or three days in his
way to town, and he hoped Mrs. Berkeley would permit

vi&s;it an aunt."</Q> The day before their arrival Mr. Monck
Berkeley &s;aid to his father, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;oon as ever

get the French and Italian grammars and the maps, and
teach her <HI>all</HI> her le&s;&s;ons over, and examine her <HI>throughly.</HI>"</Q>
Dr. Berkeley was wonderfully diverted with his <HI>&s;on's idea,</HI>
(not then thirteen years old, as Mrs. Berkeley always told
her children, <Q REND="inline">"that as &s;oon as ever they entered their <HI>teens,</HI>

<P>Mrs. Berkeley certainly had that rage from her very early

&s;till glow a little.</P>

on account of a repartee of hers to her father, when it is
probable young ladies dre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to make conque&s;ts of
worthy &s;en&s;ible men. Alas for &s;weet Mrs. I&s;ham and a

of a father on one &s;ide, and the covetou&s;ne&s;s of an

The gentleman died of a <HI>broken heart</HI> very &s;oon; the lady
&s;urvived about forty years, re&s;olved never to marry. The
<HI>lovelorn tale,</HI> too long to be in&s;erted here, is never related
by the Editor without filling her eyes with tears, after
which &s;he amu&s;es her&s;elf and her auditors by <HI>execrating</HI> the
<HI>father</HI> and <HI>uncle.</HI></P>

<P>The wit of the young lady prevailed, one cannot &s;ay
over the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the father. To do ju&s;tice to Sir Ju&s;ti|nian,
finding, that, by his par&s;imony, he had doomed his

The Editor has con&s;tantly practi&s;ed it &s;ince her return from Scotland.

<P>To the Etonian, a gentleman of many thou&s;and pounds
a year, for ages in the family, his &s;weetly amiable father
con&s;tantly took care to <HI>make</HI> Dr. Berkeley's Iri&s;h debtors
pay with tolerable punctuality. If they did not, by the

genero&s;ity of his excellent, kind relation Mr. Monck of

it was pretty much the &s;ame to Dr. Berkeley; Mr. Monck

<HI>almo&s;t</HI> as ea&s;ily contracted as bad ones, at lea&s;t &s;o a learned

of ORIGINAL SIN, although all thinking impartial Beings
mu&s;t <HI>feel</HI> it in them&s;elves.</P>

as &s;he knows &s;he has to many, to purcha&s;e, and read,
<HI>every</HI> day, two little books&mdash;BOGATSKY. When recom|mending
that excellent little volume (the York edition is

his fine faculties (too much u&s;ed) failed, and villains got in

he an&s;wered. It had been happy had he done as poor,

Mrs. Berkeley, on a vi&s;it there, of cour&s;e at Church, a barge &s;tranded, ju&s;t as the worthy Dr. Cloberry was devoutly reading the third commandment, a perplexed bargeman, without the &s;acred walls, uttered the following words, di|&s;tinctly heard by all the congregation, <Q REND="inline">"G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n your hands, why <HI>doan't</HI> you pull that rope?"</Q> The inhabitants of Marlow then had one mo&s;t ex|cellent cu&s;tom; it were to be wi&s;hed that it were practi&s;ed in other places. During Divine Service, at no fixed regular time, the Churchwardens, at|tended by other proper per&s;ons, take up their white wands, walk out of Church, and walk through the town, in&s;pect the alehou&s;es; and Mrs. Berkeley conceives the Marlow Publicans do not re&s;emble <HI>one</HI> at Cookham, who u&s;ed to &s;hut up his <HI>front</HI> door, and receive a va&s;t deal of <HI>good</HI> company through his garden, at his <HI>back</HI> door. But his <HI>landlord</HI> was one of the WORTHY Cookham Brewers, ri&s;en from being <HI>humbly thankful</HI> for a horn of fine ale when working hard at Dr. Berkeley's at Bray as a Cooper&mdash;to <HI>making</HI>&mdash;ale at Cookham, and, together with a Di&s;&s;enting Baker, during the Seque&s;tration after Dr. Berkeley re|&s;igned the living of Cookham, although he rented the hou&s;e of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, &s;hewed their love of power in a very extraordinary manner in|deed; the Brewer &s;ending repeated orders that Dr. Berkeley's cows &s;hould not be in the church-yard, the cattle have no other way to get at the Thames to drink; and the Baker bringing his linen up a ladder over a wall repeatedly to dry them on the premi&s;es, which he &s;aid were become his; not in the drying-ground appropriated for that purpo&s;e, but tying his ropes to the two fine&s;t mulberry-trees in Berk&s;hire, with which Mrs. Berkeley regaled all her neighbours far and near, rich and poor, and would as &s;oon have &s;uffered her maids to have dried her linen on them, as to have wa&s;hed it in her Dre&s;den china: but beggars &s;et on hor&s;eback <HI>generally</HI> ride <HI>bri&s;kly.</HI> Whether ABRAHAM and LEVI con&s;idered them|&s;elves <HI>great folk</HI> as de&s;cendants of the Father of the Faithful, or as COOKHAM <HI>Pari&s;h officers,</HI> Mrs. Berkeley knows not, but conceives the latter.

He was a very throughly hone&s;t, ju&s;t man, as I well know, he having done all Dr. Berkeley's work for many years; and I, of cour&s;e, always overlooked and paid his very rea&s;onable remarkably ju&s;t bills.</NOTE> round pebbles, than walk <HI>&s;moothly</HI> over its

foundation, as &s;he did the la&s;t time &s;he was in France
over a Cathedral, where &s;he had &s;ome few years before
wor&s;hiped GOD in <HI>her own way,</HI> whil&s;t a noble organ
was playing the &s;ervice during the celebrating, not
<PB N="dxcvi" REF="610">
L'OFFICE DE SAUVEUR, in which &s;he could well join.
To tell you that we have no organ at Chert&s;ey, would
be to tell an untruth; as Mrs. Berkeley hears, by report,
that the Pre&s;byterians have &s;o far given up the ideas of
their ance&s;tors as to &s;uffer the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Devil's whi&s;tle</HI>"</Q> to be played con&s;tantly in their Meeting-hou&s;es in many places, adopting, 'tis to be feared, the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> doctrine of doing and
<HI>hearing</HI> EVIL that good may come, drawing thereby many
from the Church of England wor&s;hip. However, to con|&s;ole
US in the Pari&s;h Church for the want of an organ, we
have a mo&s;t extraordinary Clerk, who, no doubt, con|ceive
<PB N="dxcvii" REF="611">
that his prayers are as prevalent as tho&s;e of ELIJAH
THE PROPHET. On my arrival here, Mrs. Frin&s;ham told
me that we had a very extraordinary Clerk indeed; but
that &s;he was told <HI>&s;he would, in time,</HI> get u&s;ed to <HI>his</HI> mode
of praying. She expre&s;&s;ed her wonder that it did not
perplex the Officiating Clergymen. She would not tell
me what it was, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould hear for my&s;elf."</Q> Ar|riving
here on the Saturday evening, I, of cour&s;e, at|tended
Divine Service twice on Sunday, as al&s;o on week|days
and the following Sunday. Having been taught, from
early youth, always to follow, never precede the Clerk in
the Confe&s;&s;ion, P&s;alms, and Re&s;pon&s;es, I was exceedingly
puzzled indeed when I came to the Litany. I rubbed my
eyes, wiped my gla&s;&s;es, but all in vain, to find out what
the poor hone&s;t Clerk &s;aid, as the words WE and FOR are
<HI>&s;o very</HI> different in their &s;ound, and, thanks be to God,
my ears are as quick as my poor eyes are dull&mdash;very
remarkably quick always; that it was not, till &s;everal
times after giving the utmo&s;t attention, that I di&s;covered
that this good man, probably conceiving that HIS prayers,
as Clerk, being louder than the re&s;t of the Congregation,
are <HI>better</HI> heard in Heaven, he very kindly, in the Litany,
in&s;tead of &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>We be&s;eech Thee to hear us, good Lord,</HI>"</Q>
&s;ays, FOR I be&s;eech Thee to hear US, good Lord. Mo&s;t of
the great Churches in town have what is called a Clerk in
Orders; I believe they &s;eldom officiate them&s;elves, but ge|nerally
by deputy; but if they do, although in Prie&s;ts
<PB N="dxcviii" REF="612">
Orders, I fancy they do not &s;upplicate for the Congregation
as this <HI>zealous</HI> Clerk does. There are &s;everal other curious
<HI>varieties,</HI> but this may &s;uffice to &s;hew how <HI>happy</HI> we are
in a Clerk. Pews are here exceedingly &s;carce; and the
good Lady who <HI>rented</HI> this hou&s;e before I took it, when
&s;he quitted the town, bequeathed her <HI>non</HI>-right in the
pew in which &s;he &s;at to a <HI>little valiant Sea-officer,</HI> not now
in employ. He, perhaps, con&s;idering him&s;elf as at &s;ea,
crowded him&s;elf and three cou&s;ins in with Mrs Frin&s;ham
and my&s;elf (the pew is &s;mall for four per&s;ons); blu&s;tered &s;o
violently, and &s;wore in Church, and at length prevailed,
by his eloquence <HI>or</HI> his oaths, on the <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> Ve&s;try
(after all the gentlemen were retired), to write me a very
curious letter indeed (it is carefully pre&s;erved by Mrs.
Frin&s;ham among&s;t her <HI>odd</HI> curio&s;ities), forbidding me to &s;it
in the &s;eat any more, <HI>they</HI> having given it to Captain BLUS|TER,
and his uncle the Coal-dealer, who are much <HI>too
genteel</HI> ever to go to Church in an afternoon, or on week|days.
I was beginning to fear we mu&s;t attend Divine Ser|vice
as u&s;ed to do the excellent Mrs. Yorke of Pirton, my
mother's aunt, who, for &s;ome years before her death, being
a cripple by the gout, was con&s;tantly lifted in and out of
her coach to take the air, or make a vi&s;it, but could not
drive into the Church; &s;he was therefore regularly carried
to Church twice every Sunday, and every Saint's day,
Wedne&s;days, and Fridays, in her &s;edan-chair, placed in the
aile, and the poles drawn out, not to incommode per&s;ons
<PB N="dxcix" REF="613">
pa&s;&s;ing to their pews; but, having at pre&s;ent no &s;edan|chair,
it occurred to me, that, unle&s;s the amiable Prelate
of this Dioce&s;e was wonderfully altered for the wor&s;e in a
few years, he would be happy to a&s;&s;i&s;t an old friend. I
accordingly wrote to him, &s;tating our hard ca&s;e. His
Lord&s;hip honoured me with a very polite an&s;wer, inclo&s;ing
one to the Churchwardens of Chert&s;ey, recommending it
to them to provide me with a pew; which they immediately
did, near the little Captain's, where we hear him talk, but
not <HI>now</HI> &s;wear and cur&s;e.&mdash;So much fore ccle&s;ia&s;tical matters;
only remarking, that the title be&s;towed on the Curate of
Chert&s;ey, as Mr. White told us, is the <HI>Journeyman</HI> Par&s;on.
I have often heard my Mother and Archdeacon Dodwell's
mother &s;ay, that the Clerk of Shotte&s;brook, a ma&s;ter &s;hoe|maker,
u&s;ed to roar out, in the P&s;alm, I am a <HI>journeyman,</HI>
as all my Fathers were; and Mr. Cherry's comment was,
<Q REND="inline">"Frith always &s;truts when he hollows it out, feeling his <HI>own</HI>
&s;uperiority over David, who, he conceives, never attained
to being a <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> workman."</Q> We never hear an oath, or
&s;ee, or hear, a drunken per&s;on, man or woman, in the

<P>Mr. Whitaker told Mrs. Frin&s;ham and Mrs. Berkeley,
that the reformation in the manners of the <HI>lower</HI> cla&s;s of
people in this place, within the&s;e la&s;t eight years, &s;ince Mr.

<P>Perhaps a few weeks &s;pent at Dover by the great

&s;eeing the <HI>whole</HI> of the evidence), the judgement <HI>may</HI> be
wrong. She conceives, as in mo&s;t other things, fortune,

<HI>did not write</HI> it non&s;en&s;e; but her once good hand, now,
when writing in ha&s;te, degenerated into a very &s;mall &s;crawl,
mu&s;t have often puzzled even the <HI>poor</HI> Devil, or the Compo|&s;itor.
A witty clerk of an uncle of hers, a very eminent
Barri&s;ter, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"My ma&s;ter writes <HI>three</HI> hands; one

The Editor, from an ugly trick contracted in very early
youth, always &s;peaks in a very low voice what &s;he is writing;
and, although her pen moves very quick, yet, the little <HI>red|rag,</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"the unruly member,"</Q> moves <HI>&s;till</HI> quicker; by which
means &s;he frequently leaves out three or four words in a
&s;entence, which &s;he is obliged to interline. She never whil&s;t
writing tittles the third vowel, cro&s;&s;es her <HI>t,</HI> or makes any
&s;top but at the beginning of a new paragraph. All this is left
<HI>to be done</HI> after the letter, &amp;c. is fini&s;hed; and, like mo&s;t other
things po&s;tponed, is frequently <HI>not done at all;</HI> which, to
tho&s;e unacquainted with her horridly heedle&s;s manner of
writing, makes her letters <HI>very</HI> valuable Etru&s;can MSS.</P>
<P>The Editor thinks &s;he may now proceed, without be|ing
guilty of <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> to <HI>accu&s;e</HI> the Devil. Whenever the
Editor has had occa&s;ion to u&s;e the word <HI>perpetually,</HI> the

lately in an article in the Gentleman's Magazine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Tale of Woe, in the Magazine for Augu&s;t 1796.</NOTE>) is con|&s;tantly
printed PERSONALLY; which makes it in &s;ome in|&s;tances
<HI>very extraordinary</HI> non&s;en&s;e indeed.</P>

the poor text <HI>ca&s;t down</HI> into the note; as it is at the bottom

<P>Away flew Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted alacrity to
&s;erve a friend, or a &s;trange, or even a foe, if he thought
them worthy; and returned, e&s;corting his tenderly beloved,
his &s;incerely re&s;pected friend, the late amiable Lord Lou|don,
who&s;e delight in Mr. Berkeley's &s;weet &s;ociety, con&s;i|dering
the di&s;parity of their years, was wonderful.</P>
<P>Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends in Edinburgh u&s;ed
laughingly to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"that, although <HI>he</HI> might never be a
Peer <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> if he had one, might; for that cer|tainly

years, he mu&s;t infallibly marry Lady Flora Campbell,
the pre&s;ent Counte&s;s of Loudon."</Q></P>

quite &s;trangers, con&s;tantly made up to Mr. Berkeley, his
father, and his grandmother Mrs. Frin&s;ham; and little
ones in arms, the Editor has frequently &s;een &s;truggle, and
even cry, to go to Dr. Berkeley and to her Mother. But
one child in the world ever paid the Editor that compliment,
excepting her own babes. Mrs. Berkeley does not love
little children. She &s;hould e&s;teem her <HI>nature</HI> more if &s;he
did. She <HI>pities</HI> the poor little pewling di&s;agreeable animals.

<P>An odd accident happened not long after Mr. Monck
Berkeley's return to England. The very amiable Mr.
Gipps, M.P. for Canterbury, ever ready to oblige and
&s;erve his friends, permitted Mr. Monck Berkeley to have
his letters from his Scotti&s;h friends addre&s;&s;ed under cover
to him.</P>
<P>One day, when the Editor was dre&s;&s;ing for dinner, &s;he
heard a vi&s;iting-rap with the utmo&s;t <HI>&s;ang-froide,</HI> very certain
that Mr. Wright&s;on would not let any one into her apart|ment
<HI>in the morning.</HI> Pre&s;ently open flew the dre&s;&s;ing-room
door; and in flew Mrs. Gipps, out of breath, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"I

that Mr. Berkeley, with whom is <HI>my</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, is gone to
dinner in the country, &s;o I mu&s;t entreat you to make my
apology to him. When I went up to dre&s;s, I &s;aw a letter
lie on my table, the &s;eal upwards. Never minding that it
was a coronet, I <HI>&s;cratched</HI> it open. The folding of it hid
the words, 'My dear friend,' and 'Edinburgh,' and the
date. I began, and redde about half way down the fir&s;t
&s;ide. When I came to the&s;e words, 'I am mo&s;t happy
that I have it in my power to gratify my&s;elf by imme|diately

Mr. Berkeley <HI>mu&s;t</HI> think of me."</Q> The Editor here an|&s;wered
for her Son, that the only &s;en&s;ation it would occa|&s;ion
to him, would be that it had cau&s;ed a moment's di&s;|tre&s;s

<Q REND="inline">"that &s;he had not redde a tittle after &s;he came to the name
Berkeley;"</Q> of which Mrs. Berkeley was fully convinced.
Whil&s;t Mrs. Gipps was accu&s;ing her&s;elf of being a great
fool; which no one el&s;e could ever do, &s;he being ble&s;&s;ed
with an exceeding &s;trong under&s;tanding, which de&s;cends to

Berkeley prevailed on her good neighbour to &s;tay and pin

only fa&s;tened by one pin, &s;uch was her ha&s;te to exculpate
her&s;elf from what very few would have &s;u&s;pected her of.
It afforded a plea&s;ant laugh at the next Canterbury rout.</P>

the be&s;t judges of painting, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fine&s;t portrait ever
produced by any pencil, ancient or modern. It pre&s;erves that wonderful depth
of thought, and that exqui&s;ite benevolence which &s;o &s;trongly animated the

<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to prefix this &s;hort account to the following <HI>jeu
d'e&s;prit</HI> of Mr. B. then about eighteen. Some of the &s;tudents
u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if Newbourn would wear a better wig his lec|tures
would make a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on them, and talked of
burning the vile caxon. One day the young gentleman &s;ince

the hall, where it hung; when he got into the &s;treet, he told
his friend that he had got it, and was taking it home to burn it.
Mr. B. who ever from a youth hated <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> mi&s;chief,

was a tail wig. This was agreed on. Some of the gentlemen
&s;ugge&s;ted, that in the box in which it was returned, an apology
for the <HI>theft</HI> ought to be made; and Mr. B. being ever a ready
pen-man, was told he mu&s;t write the card. He took up his pen

IT is hoped, that the excellent Writer of the following
<HI>Jeu d'E&s;prit</HI> will pardon his old, his throughly grateful
Friend for publi&s;hing it without his knowledge or con&s;ent.
That it is the fir&s;t offence of the kind, cannot be pleaded
in excu&s;e. The former offence was pardoned; the work
was of a very different kind, an excellent little tract for the
children of the Sunday Schools near his own e&s;tate. There
being no title-page, the Writer of this introduction prefixed
one, <Q REND="inline">"Written by Henry Grim&s;ton, E&s;quire;"</Q> of whom it

<L>"In wit a man, &s;implicity a child."</L></Q></P>

would be too weighty a ta&s;k; it may be learned from every

together, under the &s;ame roof; and never ob&s;erved, or
even heard, that he had the &s;hadow of any vice; but firmly
believes that he is ble&s;&s;ed with every virtue. He was the
cho&s;en, the beloved, the re&s;pected, the bo&s;om friend of the
amiable hearted George-Monck Berkeley, E&s;quire. His <HI>un|wearied
attentions</HI> to Mr. Berkeley, during the two la&s;t years
of his painful journey through this vale of mi&s;ery to the realms
of bli&s;s, prove the &s;oundne&s;s of Mr. Berkeley's judgement,
when, at the age of about twenty, he &s;aid to his Mother,
<Q REND="inline">"I have, I thank God, many friends that I <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome</HI>
that I <HI>re&s;pect,</HI> but the man I fix on for my fa&s;t friend through

<HEAD>AN ELEGY</HEAD>
<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF MASTER GEORGE-ROBERT BERKELEY, SECOND SON OF THE REV. DR.
BERKELEY, PREBENDARY OF CANTERBURY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who died April
15, 1775, aged eight years, four months, and four days, after only one week's
illne&s;s, of a dreadful putrid fever, then raging in Canterbury; as did one of
his beloved &s;chool-fellows, that lovely child, Ma&s;|ter Tatton, only &s;on
of the Reverend Dr. Tatton, Prebendary of Canterbury, and grand&s;on of the
charitable, bountiful Dean Lynch. No art could pre|vent this &s;weet child from
calling three or four times in the day to know how his friend did. Ma&s;ter
Robert Berkeley &s;ickened on one Saturday, and died the next. Ma&s;ter Tatton
was going to take a ride, it being holyday. When got as far as Burghgate, the
<HI>di&s;mal</HI> &s;ound of the <HI>great</HI> bell a&s;&s;ailed his ear; he
dropped his bridle, and &s;aid to the &s;ervant attending him,
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! <HI>my dear</HI> Robert is dead, and my ride is
&s;poiled."</Q> He turned his hor&s;e, went home, fickened that very evening,
and died the next Saturday. The&s;e little crea|tures were lovely and
plea&s;ant in their lives, and in their deaths were not di|vided. The elegant
<HI>application</HI> of this text is borrowed from a mo&s;t charm|ing letter of
the highly cultivated Mrs. Cox, of St. Giles, Oxford, to Mrs. George Berkeley,
thanking her for Dr. Berkeley's long-&s;mothered &s;ermon, preached at Lambeth
Palace, at the con&s;ecration of his beloved old friend, the angelic Bi&s;hop
Horne; (&s;ee p. 159.) Dr. Berkeley did not long &s;urvive his beloved Friend.

A younger brother of Dr. Berkeley's, who died at about &s;eventeen, had the &s;ame &s;pirit as his little nephew. The Bi&s;hop early gave his &s;ons a large allowance for cloaths, &amp;c. A collection was making for a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Baronet. The Bi&s;hop called on his &s;ons to contribute. Dr. Berkeley flew to his room, and brought down twenty guineas.

<Q REND="inline">"No, no, my dear Molly, I know very well you won't <HI>do
that.</HI>"</Q> On which Mrs. Berkeley pre&s;enting her&s;elf, the little man
&s;kipped off to his room in an in&s;tant, and his Mother &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Molly, how many fibs you do tell that child! for you know
that you never told a tale of him in your life, nor would if he was to torment
you from morning till night."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, to be &s;ure Madam, I &s;hould not; for at la&s;t, by
threatening him with YOU, I get him to do what he &s;hould do."</Q> Mrs.
Berkeley, till within the&s;e very few years, made an annual grateful offering
to a worthy woman, who lived with her mother when SHE was &s;ix years old, for
not telling of her when &s;he climbed the trees like a boy.</NOTE> who always
waited upon him,
<Q REND="inline">"Molly teach me to pray."</Q> She replied, with tears,
<Q REND="inline">"My angel, God will teach you to pray."</Q> He &s;aid, with
great earne&s;tne&s;s,
<Q REND="inline">"Lord, teach my heart to pray."</Q> He had always been told,
that the prayer which <HI>reacheth</HI> to God mu&s;t come <HI>from</HI> the
<HI>heart,</HI> and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray. He
always u&s;ed Bi&s;hop Kenn's prayers and hymns in The Winche&s;ter Scholar.
Whenever Mrs. Berkeley was alone, her children always offered their prayers,
and repeated or &s;ang their hymns with her. One evening, as he was repeating
the following ver&s;e in Bi&s;hop Kenn's evening hymn,
<Q><L>But though &s;leep o'er my frailty reigns,</L>
<L>Let it not hold me long in chains,</L>
<L>And now and then let loo&s;e my heart,</L>
<L>Till it an Hallelujah dart&mdash;</L></Q> his Mother de&s;ired him to omit it, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"Although it might &s;uit the exalted piety of Bi&s;hop Kenn,
it was in him (little <HI>Robert</HI>) mocking God, as &s;he did not believe he
had devotion &s;ufficient to wi&s;h to wake in the middle of the night to
prai&s;e God."</Q> He &s;tood about a minute &s;ilent, pen|&s;ive; then
replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma, I do de&s;ire to awake to prai&s;e God in the
night; &s;o, if you plea&s;e to give me leave, I will &s;ay it as I always do
when I &s;ay it to Molly Phipps,"</Q> the very worthy woman above named, who
doated on him, and he on her. His Mother rejoiced that her child ex|celled her
in piety, &s;he always omitting it her&s;elf. He was, perhaps, the mo&s;t
ingenious and accompli&s;hed little creature any where to be &s;een. As his
bro|ther was re&s;olved not to learn to read, &s;o he &s;eemed re&s;olved to
learn with|out being taught. He would conjure his mother not to tell him, and
clap his little hand over her mouth, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould begin, or rather go
on &s;peak|ing; but, as he termed it, let him <HI>gue&s;s it out</HI>
him&s;elf, how words were to be &s;pelt or pronounced. At the age of four and
an half he redde as well as he could have done at fourteen. He could find out
in the Calendar the le&s;&s;ons for the day, for Sundays, and holydays,
whil&s;t he remained in petticoats. On <HI>week</HI> days, he &s;at with his
Mother in the &s;eats appropriate to the Prebendaries' Ladies. The amiable
worthy lady of the late Dr. Caryl, both of whom doated on him, u&s;ed to &s;ay,

<Q REND="inline">"It is like the idea one has of praying in Heaven, to hear
this <HI>little</HI> Cherubring this great choir when he chaunts. I really
believe he under&s;tands better what he is about than half the <HI>grown-up
people</HI> that come hither."</Q> Accident di&s;covered to his mother the
&s;trength of his me|mory: her own was once pretty good, &s;he having often
heard her mother &s;ay, that &s;he learned the alphabet at once &s;hewing; that
the next day &s;he knew every letter: but Robert much excelled his mother. Mrs.
Berkeley, being a pretty good <HI>Bible &s;cholar,</HI> u&s;ed to work with her
needle, as &s;he never put out any work of any &s;ort or kind, whil&s;t her
children were reading the Scriptures. In Hi&s;tory, Geography, &amp;c. that
would not do. One day, ob|&s;erving little Robert going on perfectly right, and
finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room, &s;he enquired what he was
at, looking off his book? He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma, you know when one has redde any thing <HI>in</HI>
the book <HI>once,</HI> one can read it <HI>without</HI> the book afterwards;
and a little while ago I redde this chapter <HI>in</HI> the book in the
&s;ervants' hall Bible; &s;o now I can <HI>read</HI> it <HI>without</HI> the
book to you to-day."</Q> A boy, having cut off &s;ome of his fine curling
ringlets, which hung below the bottom of his back, he was very angry, and
&s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"He would never forgive him."</Q>&mdash;His Mother a&s;&s;ured
him,
<Q REND="inline">"He would go to hell if he did not."</Q>&mdash;He then
replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Then, I will forgive him; <HI>but I will never forget
it.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you mu&s;t, or God will not love you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well then, if God <HI>will have</HI> me forget it, he mu&s;t
MAKE me do it, for I never did forget any thing I ever heard or &s;aw in my
whole life."</Q> When a little child, not being allowed &s;ci&s;&s;ors for fear
of his beautiful eyes, he with his fingers pinched out in paper, birds,
bea&s;ts, &s;hips, flowers, &amp;c. &s;o accurately as was a&s;toni&s;hing; he
drew very finely; his &s;e|cond le&s;&s;on, a cow's head, is pre&s;erved as a
prodigy of genius. He danced delightfully, and could go through all the
military exerci&s;e of the infantry, Dr. Berkeley always paid a &s;erjeant for
attending his Sons. He &s;poke French as fluently as he did Engli&s;h. He, as
well as his Brother, repeated by heart, and acted delightfully. He chaunted and
&s;ang finely. His beloved &s;chool-fellows were, lovely little Tatton, the
pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ible, worthy, Samuel Saw-bridge, e&s;q. of Ollantigh, and the
learned Dr. Herbert Packe, &s;on of the celebrated Dr. Packe, of Canterbury.
The Saturday on which he &s;ickened in the evening, he flew up at twelve
o'clock, to conjure his Mother, to give him permi&s;&s;ion to invite
<Q REND="inline">"my dear Sam to dinner to-day."</Q> It was, alas! the la&s;t
dinner he ever ate; he &s;ickened about eight in the evening. Here follows a
proof of this gentleman's hone&s;ty in very early youth. <HI>Some</HI> of the
Upper School Boys had a <HI>&s;hameful</HI> trick of <HI>robbing</HI> the very
worthy Mrs. Longley, in the church-yard, of <HI>a dozen</HI> oranges when they
<HI>purcha&s;ed half a dozen.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary to have one little boy
as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to this ho|nourable action. Samuel Sawbridge was enticed;
to which he &s;en&s;ibly, nobly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"What! take Mrs. Longley's oranges <HI>without paying</HI> for
them! Mi&s;s Tucker teaches me my Catechi&s;m; and that &s;ays, "THOU SHALT NOT
STEAL;" and <HI>&s;he</HI> tells me, "that taking any thing from any body,
without paying for it, <HI>is &s;tealing;</HI> &s;o I won't go with you."</Q>
This gentleman not then quite &s;even years old, all Canterbury rang with this
tale. Mrs. Berkeley a&s;ked her little Robert if he thought he &s;hould have
been as hone&s;t as his dear friend Samuel? To which he made the following
reply:
<Q REND="inline">"God knows&mdash;God knows, my dear Mamma, if I had been
tempted, what <HI>I might</HI> have done; THANK God, THANK God, they did not
<HI>a&s;k</HI> me;"</Q> and he &s;huddered as he energetically uttered the
reply. This lovely creature was, to be &s;ure, wonderfully ambitious. He
repeatedly, until told it was a wicked idea, a&s;ked his mother,
<Q REND="inline">"Mamma, if I was to read Greek and Latin all day and all
night, and &s;tudy violently hard, could I come to be a King? I &s;hould
<HI>like</HI> to be a King."</Q> Such a thought never entered the head of his
dear brother, nor perhaps of any other child.</NOTE>!"</L>

SEVERAL things of Mr. Berkeley's writing having been
noticed, &s;ome quite ready for publication at the time of
his decea&s;e; the Editor feels it a &s;ort of duty to mention a
work <HI>not</HI> ready for the pre&s;s, not <HI>even</HI> written, but con|&s;tantly
<HI>talked</HI> of by Mr. Berkeley from the early age of fif|teen&mdash;a

as taught in the pure&s;t Church on Earth, the &s;uperexcel|lent
CHURCH OF ENGLAND. Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed now and

all who hope to be happy here and hereafter; a &s;trong proof of which he gave
the la&s;t time of his being at Bath. He and his excellent un|wearied friend,
Mr. Grim&s;ton, lodged and boarded at Mr. Garret's.</P>
<P>A <HI>bon mot</HI> of Mr. Whitaker's cannot here be omitted.
Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. going one day to vi&s;it Dr. Berkeley's
relation, the very worthy Colonel Butler, at Thorpe; on
their arrival, they found he had died three days before,
Mr. Whitaker rode up to the carriage, and enquiring how
Mr. Monck Berkeley did? and where he was? hearing
that he was at Bath, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am going thither in two
days; where &s;hall I find him?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"At Mr. Garret's."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Whitaker.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'P&s;haw! how could I be &s;uch a block|head
to a&s;k?&mdash;a POET is always in a GARRET."</Q></P>
<P>Several gentlemen boarded, who could not lodge, at
Mr. Garret's. Among&s;t the&s;e was the, at Bath, well|known
Captain Lawley.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="824">
Soon after the arrival of Mr. Grim&s;ton and Mr. Berkeley,
this wretched Captain began to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> the two young men
in the <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> doctrine of there being <HI>no</HI> God, &amp;c. &amp;c.
that the idea of Hell and its Prince was all a bug-a-boo, to
keep &s;illy <HI>women</HI> in a little order. Many arguments did
the&s;e two young Chri&s;tian men u&s;e with this wretched old
Athei&s;t; but all, alas! in vain. One day he was mi&s;&s;ed
from dinner; the &s;econd he appeared not. On an enquiry
being &s;ent to his lodgings, word was brought that he was
very ill. Mr. Grim&s;ton and Mr. Berkeley went to call on
him, and found him, as his apothecary &s;aid, very dangerou&s;ly
ill indeed, with little hope of recovery. Both were ex|ceedingly
&s;hocked at his &s;ituation. Mr. Grim&s;ton earne&s;tly
reque&s;ted Mr. Berkeley to talk to him concerning his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas! no, my dear friend, he NOW
wants an abler coun&s;ellor than I am."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grim&s;ton.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What can we do for him?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"We will go, and reque&s;t the favour of that
gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has forgotten the gentleman's name; but thinks that it was Mr. Jack&s;on, rector of St. Jame's church.</NOTE>, who&s;e preaching we both &s;o much admire,
to go him, to talk to him, and pray with him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="825">
They immediately went to Mr. Jack&s;on, who &s;aid to
them, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, out of re&s;pect to you, as you &s;eem
&s;o earne&s;tly to wi&s;h it, <HI>I</HI> will go; but am con&s;ident I &s;hall
make no more impre&s;&s;ion on him than on this marble
hearth on which I &s;tand; for he is the mo&s;t <HI>determined</HI>
Athei&s;t, the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> ridiculer of every thing &s;acred, that
is any where to be found."</Q></P>
<P>The young gentlemen, however, continued very de|&s;irous,
and the worthy Divine complied; &s;o each party
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>delivered their own &s;oul:</HI>"</Q> but, lamentable thought! the
wretched Captain Lawley re&s;olved to die as he had lived,
and meet Bug-a-boo, <Q>"Unhou&s;el'd, unanneal'd, unanointed."</Q></P>
<P>One day, when the two gentlemen were vi&s;iting him
during his illne&s;s, he fixed his eyes earne&s;tly in &s;ilence on
Mr. Berkeley, and at length &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley, I &s;hould
be very glad of a pair of your old &s;hoes, Sir."</Q> Mr.
Berkeley, rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"My <HI>old</HI> &s;hoes,
Captain Lawley? I believe my &s;ervant would object to
that; but, if a pair of my new ones will do as well, I am
&s;ure there are a pair or two, if you plea&s;e, very much at
<PB N="184" REF="826">
your &s;ervice."</Q> He looked thoughtful, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"I
think I &s;hould like <HI>your</HI> &s;hoes."</Q> Mr. Grim&s;ton conceived
that he meant it, as is &s;ometimes &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I would not be
in his &s;hoes, or his coat,"</Q> when any one is in a &s;crape.</P>
<P>On opening the Captain's will at his death, it appeared
that he had, during his very few days illne&s;s, made a will
in favour of a gentleman, who, a few days before it, had
cau&s;ed the gentleman and, the Editor thinks, &s;ome ladies
of character who boarded at Mr. Garret's (by their &s;er|vants)
to prevent Captain Lawley from fighting this gentle|man,
by contriving to prevent their meeting one evening.
He had, by this <HI>wonderful</HI> will, ruined two very near rela|tions
(the Editor thinks nieces) whom he had obliged to
give up keeping a very good &s;chool for young ladies, by
allowing them hand&s;omely, and promi&s;ing to leave them
his fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley was &s;o convinced that the Captain's
intellects were deranged, from the beginning of his illne&s;s,
that, being about to leave Bath, he left his addre&s;s in
writing with &s;ome proper per&s;on, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"If the will was
conte&s;ted by the relations, he was ready to give his evi|dence
whenever called upon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="827">
On the publication of the Captain's will, the very wor|thy
Sir Robert Lawley, Baronet, his cou&s;in-german, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"It &s;hould be conte&s;ted <HI>entirely</HI> at his expence, on behalf
of his worthy kin&s;women; and that him&s;elf would not
come in for a &s;hilling of the fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Some months before Mr. Monck Berkeley's death, he
received a letter from Doctors Commons, reque&s;ting to
know when it would be convenient to him to receive &s;ome
gentlemen thence, to take his depo&s;itions concerning Cap|tain
Lawley. He appointed an early day; and &s;everal gen|tlemen
arrived one morning, from Wood's at Maidenhead
Bridge, at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham, &s;tayed near two hours
with Mr. Monck Berkeley, received his depo&s;ition; and,
the Editor hopes, &s;ome <HI>very thick</HI> good Vannilla chocolate,
&s;andwiches, white wine and water, &amp;c. which &s;he or|dered
to be &s;ent in to them.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley reque&s;ted, if he lived until it was decided,
that he might be informed whether the will were e&s;tabli&s;hed
or not. About a fortnight before his lamented death he
received a letter from a gentleman of the Commons, telling
<PB N="186" REF="828">
him that the Court had rejected the will of Captain
Lawley.</P>
<P>It were much to be wi&s;hed that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court
could &s;ometimes act as a Court of EQUITY. They would,
they &s;hould &s;urely, had they been applied to, have &s;et
a&s;ide the will of a wretched old Fanatic of Hull, who
after having kept his dutiful, amiable, only &s;on near
nine years with an eminent Clergyman of the Church of
England, who takes private pupils, &s;ent him down to
Scotland to the Univer&s;ity of St. Andrew's; as he wrote
to Dr. Forre&s;t, one of the Profe&s;&s;ors, <Q REND="inline">"that he might learn
to preach the <HI>everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> as a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> mini&s;ter
in England."</Q> Mr. Rogers was accordingly, to his great
di&s;tre&s;s, entered of the Divinity Colledge. The wonderful
amiability of his nature, and the &s;weetne&s;s of his manners,
rendered him univer&s;ally beloved by per&s;ons of all ranks.
His zeal to &s;uccour and &s;ave, and his genero&s;ity <HI>when &s;aved,</HI>
to poor &s;hipwrecked per&s;ons on the coa&s;t of St. Andrew's,
u&s;ed to occa&s;ion Mr. Monck Berkeley's &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Well,
now Rogers <HI>is</HI> happy; he is po&s;ting off to a wreck, with
three or four bottles, and blankets innumerable. He
<PB N="187" REF="829">
has ordered beds to be ready for all the poor creatures
that are e&s;caped."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Rogers attended divine &s;ervice regularly at Dr.
Berkeley's every Sunday. Several letters arrived from the
father, a&s;king when his &s;on would be FIT <HI>to preach</HI> in the
<HI>Meeting-hou&s;e</HI> that <HI>he</HI> had <HI>built</HI> ready for him. This diverted
his friends: but, as the frogs in the fable &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Although
it is <HI>&s;port to you,</HI> it is <HI>death to us.</HI>"</Q> Poor Mr. Rogers,
extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, applied, as hundreds of others did, to
Dr. Berkeley for advice and direction; who told him, <Q REND="inline">"that
perhaps, if his wi&s;h was to become a Divine of the Church
of England, he had better apply to his Father, who, as
his grand de&s;ire &s;eemed to be to <HI>hear</HI> his &s;on <HI>preach,</HI> and
as he was very rich, might buy the next pre&s;entation
of a living with an aged incumbent on it."</Q> The ca&s;e was
properly &s;tated to the old man; who &s;oon returned for an|&s;wer,
<Q REND="inline">"that, having met with &s;ome <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> who had agreed
to give him a <HI>very high</HI> rent for his meeting-hou&s;e, he had
let it to them, left the Pre&s;byterians, and become a
<HI>Bapti&s;t him&s;elf;</HI> and his &s;on might be of the Church of
England if he plea&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="830">
Dr. Berkeley, with his wonted goodne&s;s, applied to his
old tutor, the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of York, &s;tating the ca&s;e
to his Grace, and reque&s;ting him to ordain Mr. Rogers,
on the te&s;timonial of &s;everal of the re&s;pectable Profe&s;&s;ors at
St. Andrew's with regard to his life and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The Editor &s;uppo&s;es that the te&s;timonial of the learned
Dean Hill, Profe&s;&s;ors Hunter, Baron, Cook, &amp;c. of Mr.
Rogers's learning, life, and conver&s;ation, and Dr. Berke|ley's
<HI>own</HI> knowledge of his holding <Q REND="inline">"no doctrine con|trary
to the Church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,"</Q>
induced his Grace to ordain the very worthy young man,
without a te&s;timonial from Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin.
Perhaps the Editor, in this la&s;t &s;entence, may be wri|ting
like a fool, as &s;he has not for many years heard
a te&s;timonial for orders redde. If &s;he has &s;o done, &s;he
is &s;orry for it. The old man was &s;o delighted, that he
&s;et off in his po&s;t-chai&s;e and <HI>four</HI> for York, to &s;ee his &s;on
ordained in that magnificent Cathedral. He was quite
tran&s;ported, and had <HI>&s;ome</HI> thoughts of becoming a mem|ber
of the Church of England. However, that idea was
<HI>tran&s;ient;</HI> and on his amiable &s;on's going to &s;ettle at
or near Hull, this old <HI>nump&s;cull</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on his <HI>preaching</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="831">
at the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> meeting; which Mr. Rogers utterly refu&s;ing
to do, he ca&s;t him off, married a young Bapti&s;t, and entirely
di&s;inherited him; and this throughly amiable man is now,
as the Editor hears from her beloved excellent friend,
Henry Grim&s;ton, E&s;quire, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Curate at or near
Beverley in York&s;hire. The old wretch allowed him very
hand&s;omely during his re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity of St.
Andrew's, or his bounties to the poor could not have been
&s;o exten&s;ive as all then re&s;ident there knew them to be;
but even then <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>bea&s;t</HI> &s;hewed his nature."</Q></P>
<P>His only daughter, as Mr. Rogers was his only &s;on, was
married to Captain Lee, the fir&s;t officer, as it was then &s;aid,
who ever &s;ailed from England in a copper-bottomed ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>This gentleman was either dead, or the &s;hip and crew
&s;uppo&s;ed to be lo&s;t, or carried into &s;lavery; the Editor thinks
the latter to have been the ca&s;e. And no entreaties could
prevail on this vile old HODMADOD to tell his poor &s;on in
what part of the kingdom his &s;i&s;ter, with, the Editor
thinks, four young children, re&s;ided.</P>
<P>The Editor, one day a&s;king her Son what could induce
the wretch, if he was in his &s;en&s;es, to be &s;uch a BRUTE; he
<PB N="190" REF="832">
replied, in his mo&s;t &s;weetly plaintive voice, when feeling the
woes of other, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my dear Mother, he <HI>is</HI> in his &s;en&s;es;
but he <HI>wants</HI> the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of <HI>feeling,</HI> which he knows <HI>his &s;on</HI> has
in an eminent degree; and he is afraid that Rogers &s;hould
a&s;&s;i&s;t his, I &s;adly fear, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;i&s;ter, as it is &s;o long &s;ince
her hu&s;band has been heard of, and Rogers knows her
father <HI>won't</HI> relieve her, <HI>becau&s;e,</HI> the <HI>week</HI> before &s;he was
with <HI>his</HI> con&s;ent to be married to Captain Lee, he bade
her <HI>turn him off,</HI> and marry a young, plump Pre&s;byte|rian
par&s;on that he brought to her; but &s;he preferred
Captain Lee; and her <HI>cunning</HI> father took <HI>that</HI> opportu|nity
to pocket the fortune he had promi&s;ed to give to
Captain Lee with her."</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;urely a defect in our laws, although excellent in
general, that a vilely covetous, or horridly capricious father
or mother, can, at their <HI>own</HI> plea&s;ure, either beggar or
damn, perhaps both in one, their own ill-fated offspring.</P>
<P>Parents &s;hould have <HI>all</HI> power during youth, <HI>none</HI> at all
after children come to years of di&s;cretion; and, if they are
<HI>wi&s;e</HI> or <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> if they have it, let them renounce it, as the Edi|tor
<PB N="191" REF="833">
always &s;olemnly prote&s;ted to Dr. Berkeley that &s;he would
do, he u&s;ing to &s;ay, when his children were young, that he
would leave them dependant on her for bread, that they
might be dutiful. Mrs. Berkeley a&s;&s;ured him, that much
within a month after his decea&s;e &s;he would put it out of
her power to rob the children of a dead father; that &s;he
would, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, make them dutiful, although
they had an independance of ten thou&s;and a year.</P>
<P>The Editor was exceedingly delighted the fir&s;t time &s;he
heard it, and has diverted many per&s;ons &s;ince, with the
account given of her&s;elf by the late, &s;en&s;ible, agreeable Lady
Grey, of Denne Hill, Kent, mother of the late Sir James
Grey, many years his Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;&s;ador to the Court of
Spain,</P>
<P>The Editor has an old trick, like her late excellent rela|tion,
Sir Martin Wright, of thinking aloud. It is in her
quite involuntary, as &s;he conceives it mu&s;t have been in
him. When &s;itting on the <HI>judgement-&s;eat,</HI> he would &s;ay
loud enough to be heard by the barri&s;ters, &s;ome of whom
&s;he has heard relate it to her mother: <Q REND="inline">"WELL PUT, Mr.
Hume Campbell; <HI>that</HI> will do."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline">"OH!
<PB N="192" REF="834">
LAMENTABLE, LAMENTABLE! Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>that will</HI>
never <HI>do, never do at all.</HI>"</Q> So the Editor, the fir&s;t vi&s;it
&s;he made at Denne Hill, on entering the room where hung
a magnificent whole-length portrait of the then King of
Spain, of whom Mr. Clarke gives &s;o curious an account,
as al&s;o of the lamentations of his amiable Queen, when the
&s;entence of death was pronounced to her, not by <HI>French
devils,</HI> but by her wi&s;e, pious Confe&s;&s;or; the Editor's
eyes being better then than now, &s;he caught Dr. Berkeley,
entering ju&s;t behind her, by the arm, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!&mdash;look,
do look at that man; HE mu&s;t be the uniting link
in the chain, between man and brute, between man and
devil."</Q> This was quite involuntary. Had &s;he known it
had been the MONSTER MONARCH, who, to try a new
fowling-piece, took aim and killed a poor ma&s;on's labourer
a&s;cending a ladder in view, the <HI>pre-jug&eacute;e</HI> might have had
&s;hare in her &s;entence. To be &s;ure, according to the Edi|tor's
idea, it is the mo&s;t extraordinary countenance &s;he
ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The witty, worthy Lady Grey, who became a widow
before &s;he was thirty, and continued &s;uch until ninety,
when, the oil all exhau&s;ted, the lamp went gently out,
<PB N="193" REF="835">
u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know how it is that young widows
marry &s;o fa&s;t: <HI>I</HI> could not contrive to do it. To be
&s;ure, <HI>very &s;oon</HI> after Sir James's death, I had a multitude
of lovers, from Lords and Commons. I heard of nothing
but my <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>wit.</HI> However, as &s;oon as I had a
little dried my eyes for the death of poor Sir James, I
&s;ent for a lawyer, and &s;ettled the money (about an hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds) that he had left <HI>entirely</HI> in my
power on his poor little orphans; and whether it was
that I grew ugly and fooli&s;h at <HI>nine and twenty,</HI> or <HI>what
el&s;e</HI> I know not; but &s;o it was, <HI>I</HI> never heard a word
more of my wit or beauty, nor ever had a lover after|wards."</Q>
Her witty Lady&s;hip had admirers, if not lovers,
to the la&s;t of her long life on earth.</P>
<P>A poor, old, doating, rich Divine in the neighbourhood
of Cloyne, a widower with &s;everal children, was going to
marry a girl; it reached the ears of Bi&s;hop Berkeley, who
immediately vi&s;ited him, and, introducing the &s;ubject, the
old gentleman &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that he &s;hould not have thought of
it, but that the <HI>young Lady was &s;o exceedingly in love with
him.</HI>"</Q> How much weaker is <HI>&s;econd</HI> childhood, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;ans
eyes, &s;ans teeth,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. than the fir&s;t! The Bi&s;hop
<PB N="194" REF="836">
&s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"if that was the ca&s;e, the Lady would at any rate
marry him."</Q> He a&s;&s;ented, and the Bi&s;hop prevailed on
him to &s;ettle his fortune on his children after his own
death; which &s;o entirely cured the young lady's <HI>violent
pa&s;&s;ion</HI> for him, that he was &s;uffered to go to his grave under
the care of his worthy children, the be&s;t guardians for aged
per&s;ons when God vouch&s;afes to &s;pare them.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley u&s;ed &s;ometimes to a&s;k Mrs. Berkeley,
<Q REND="inline">"what could induce her to marry, who could well enough
manage all her own bu&s;ine&s;s?"</Q> &amp;c. Her uniform reply
was, <Q REND="inline">"That &s;he might enjoy, and improve by, the con|ver&s;ation
of a man, of many men of &s;uperior under|&s;tanding,

<P>The Editor u&s;ed frequently to conjure her dear Son, if
&s;he &s;hould attain to old age, to govern <HI>her</HI> as carefully as
&s;he had governed <HI>him</HI> in his childhood.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="837">
The Editor is ju&s;t returned from her Pari&s;h-church,

but Dr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! he'll get off when he finds
you gone out."</Q> The Editor expre&s;&s;ed her fear that he
would not; but &s;he proceeded on her walk. On her re|turn,
&s;he was met at the ferry by Mr. Monck Berkeley's

The Editor left Dr. Berkeley, and ran home the &s;horte&s;t
way &s;he could find, through all the high, dew-be&s;prinkled

<P>When Mr. Berkeley was about thirteen, he one day &s;aid

<P>The words were immediately written. The &s;weet
lad's eyes &s;parkled with joy when he redde them. He
carefully folded them up, and walked away to his own
room. At dinner the curious dialogue was related to dear
Dr. Berkeley, and the Editor never heard or thought of it
more, until examining the &s;mall trunk, containing many of
his precious depo&s;its, delivered into her hands by the
faithful Mrs. Leyce&s;ter, Mr. Berkeley's bed-maker at Mag|dalen
Hall, mentioned before in this Preface. This <HI>te&s;ti|monial</HI>

Once, when &s;he reque&s;ted him much to vi&s;it in town a

The Editor's reque&s;t to her dear &s;on to govern her, in

what he one day &s;aid at St. Andrew's.</P>
<P>Soon after his return from a vi&s;it in the Country to his
beloved friend, the univer&s;ally beloved, re&s;pected, amiable
Sir John Ram&s;ay, Advocate in Edinburgh, who&s;e early
death, at twenty-eight, Mr. Berkeley never cea&s;ed to
lament, when &s;peaking of that excellent young gentleman.
Mr. Berkeley &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am certainly a very lucky fellow;
for, let me go where I will, I <HI>always find</HI> a mother. At

His great good &s;en&s;e, like that of his dear friend Mr.

and, &amp;c. &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley u&s;ed to tell his father, that he

<Q REND="inline">"She had a wonderful <HI>knack</HI> of making the young men

are wi&s;e enough to profit by it, to have a wi&s;e male advi&s;er
who has lived in the world, who knows life, as it is
wire-termed. A wi&s;e wife or father, or a worthy (&s;ome

The throughly elegant Mrs. Montagu has ever

dining in the country, &s;oon after dinner Mr. Berkeley
walked out, and returning immediately, flew into the eating

&s;prang up, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child, has your Father been

The moment this was applied it cea&s;ed; but that was genuine, prepared by, and procured from, the hone&s;t wife of the Manche&s;ter baker; to whom a famous French &s;urgeon, in gratitude for her goodne&s;s in nur&s;ing him through a very long illne&s;s, communicated the &s;ecret. For years it was &s;old only in Manche&s;ter. Happy for the public had it continued, as well as &s;ome other famous Patent Medicines, in hone&s;t hands. The Editor means, if God &s;pares her life, to give in the Gentleman's Magazine &s;ome account of the almo&s;t miraculous cures wrought by this a&s;toni&s;hingly fine medicine, as many medical gentlemen, high in their pro|fe&s;&s;ion, have declared it to be, when they have by their <HI>eloquence</HI> prevailed on the Editor to let them ta&s;te it&mdash;&s;he not exhibiting to the <HI>Faculty,</HI> left they &s;hould maliciou&s;ly laugh, as &s;he tells them, and call her <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Lady Boun|tiful.</HI>"</Q> Alas! &s;he cannot now get it from Mr. Hatfield the baker's daughter at Manche&s;ter.

Hoopers to take into their own hands again the preparing their fa|ther Dr. Hooper's excellent pills. The&s;e pills, genuine, cured a re&s;pecta|ble old &s;ervant of the Editor's of &s;even large wounds in one leg; not that ALL Patent Medicines, prepared by the Proprietors, <HI>if</HI> they happen to be covetous, are genuine, as the Editor's poor weakened &s;tomach lamentably feels, and pretty certainly will feel as long as &s;he continues an inhabitant of this &s;ublunary world. She hopes and believes that her private admonition has, on his <HI>own</HI> account, wrought re-formation on the Medicine, if not on Preparer. Re&s;pect for the very worthy vender keeps the name of the &s;aid adulterated medicine from being publi&s;hed; as &s;he verily believes it is &s;ince her vi&s;it in <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> properly prepared&mdash;if not from <HI>principle,</HI> yet from POLICY.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="848">Mr. B.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, it does not bleed a drop; but &s;end John

<P>Mr. Melville &s;oon arrived, the poor man did well, and
perhaps is now living, ble&s;&s;ing, with many others in St.
Andrew's, Mr. Monck Berkeley's lovely charity. The
poor man was warned not five minutes before, by a woman
of the mill, to be aware of the rope that tore off his foot;
but warning, alas! does not <HI>always</HI> avail. The neglecting
it mu&s;t add weight to calamity.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this poor man's foot recalls to the Editor's
mind the pre&s;ervation of the leg of a relation of hers, S.
Cherry, E&s;quire, a cou&s;in-german of Mr. Cherry, who
&s;erved in all Queen Anne's wars, under the great Duke of
Marlborough, when be&s;ieging <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, the Editor forgets
what place. One day eight or ten officers &s;at down to
dinner in a &s;aw-pit; they agreed to make a table, by every
man laying his right leg acro&s;s the pit, in&s;tead of dropping
both into it. On beginning their dinner they wanted
&s;alt or mu&s;tard; one &s;aid, go you; another, go you to
the &s;utlers; at length Captain Cherry jumped up, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline">"I will go."</Q> At his return, he found that every officer
<PB N="208" REF="850">
had lo&s;t a leg; a chain ball had been fired from the battery,
and had quite taken off the leg of &s;ome, and &s;o &s;hattered
tho&s;e of the others, that the &s;urgeon was obliged to am|putate
them. Poor men, they all lived and went halting
to the <Q REND="inline">"hou&s;e appointed for all living,"</Q> on one leg, as
the Editor has frequently heard her unmaimed r&egrave;lation &s;ay,
at four&s;core he had not lo&s;t one of as fine a &s;et of teeth as
ever were &s;een, as white as at twenty years old;&mdash;his eye|&s;ight
almo&s;t equally good. The Editor has often heard
him and Colonel <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, a relation of her mother,
relate a very curious tran&s;action that happened between
the Duke of Marlborough and his Aid-de-Camp, Lord
Cadogan, father of the late Duche&s;s of Richmond, that
does honour to both noblemen.</P>
<P>The Editor regrets, always did regret, that &s;he is of a
<HI>terribly</HI> long-lived family, on both &s;ides. It is, however,
&s;ome plea&s;ure to her to think that her Father and Mother
both died much younger than &s;he now is; but, alas!
tho&s;e two excellent Chri&s;tians were <HI>quite ripe</HI> for GLORY
before they went to enjoy it. She never could quite &s;ub|&s;cribe
to that beautiful &s;imile in Dean Hickes's "Reformed
Devotions," in one of the P&s;alms of the Prpa ratory

her age of &s;eventeen:<Q><L>"No matter how late the fruit be gathered; if it &s;till go
on in growing better.</L>
<L>"No matter how &s;oon it fall from the tree; if not blown
down before it be ripe."</L></Q></P>
<P>To the latter ver&s;e &s;he heartily &s;ub&s;cribes, although to
the former ver&s;e <HI>not quite:</HI> it is only THY WILL, be it

the next day, by whom it has been carefully pre&s;erved for more than thirty

concerning tho&s;e lines, &s;he thinking of them ju&s;t as &s;he did at
fifteen. She ble&s;&s;es GOD that no <HI>&s;uch</HI> flights are to be found in
Mr. Monck Berkeley's Poems. The Editor cannot omit mentioning here two &s;hort
con|ver&s;ations held with her Son at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t ten years.
When a <HI>very</HI> young man, he &s;hewed to his Mother &s;ome charming

deprive you of your poor Mother&mdash;that &s;he was gone to Chri&s;t."</Q> Mr.
