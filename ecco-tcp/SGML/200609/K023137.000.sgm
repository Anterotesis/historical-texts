<HEAD>A Full and True
ACCOUNT
Of a Horrid and Barbarous
REVENGE by POISON, On the Body of Mr. <HI>Edm. Curll,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY furni&s;hes us with Examples of many Satyrical
Authors who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge, but not
of any Book&s;ellers that I know of, except the unfortunate
Subject of the following Papers; I mean Mr. <HI>Edmund
Curll,</HI> at the <HI>Bible</HI> and <HI>Dial</HI> in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> who was Ye&s;terday
poi&s;on'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> after having liv'd many Years an In&s;tance of the
mild Temper of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>Every Body knows that the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> on Monday the
26th In&s;tant, publi&s;h'd a Satyrical Piece, entituled <HI>Court Poems,</HI> in the
Preface whereof they were attributed to a <HI>Lady of Quality,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
or Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>; by which indi&s;creet Method, though he had e&s;caped one
Revenge, there were &s;till two behind in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Now on the Wedne&s;day en&s;uing, between the Hours of 10 and 11,
Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> a neighb'ring Book&s;eller, de&s;ir'd a Conference with Mr.
<HI>Curll</HI> about &s;ettling the <HI>Title Page</HI> of <HI>Wiquefort</HI>'s <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> inviting him
at the &s;ame Time to take a Whet together. Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> (who is not
the only In&s;tance how Per&s;ons of bright Parts may be carry'd away
by the In&s;tigations of the Devil) found Means to convey him&s;elf into
the &s;ame Room, under pretence of Bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> who it
<PB N="3" REF="3">
&s;eems is the Printer of his <HI>Homer.</HI> This Gentleman with a &s;eeming
Coolne&s;s, reprimanded Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> for wrongfully a&s;cribing to him the a|fore&s;aid
Poems: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by declaring that one of his Au|thors
(Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> by Name) gave the Copies to the Pre&s;s, and
wrote the <HI>Preface.</HI> Upon this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (being to all appearance re|concil'd)
very civilly drank a Gla&s;s of Sack to Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> which he as
civilly pledged; and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Ta&s;te differ'd not
from common Sack, yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer
felt &s;oon after, that &s;ome poi&s;onous Drug had been &s;ecretly infu&s;ed
therein.</P>
<P>About Eleven a Clock he went home, where his Wife ob&s;erving his
Colour chang'd, &s;aid, <HI>Are you not Sick, my Dear?</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Bloody
Sick</HI>; and incontinently fell a vomiting and &s;training in an uncommon
and unnatural Manner, the Contents of his vomiting being as Green as
Gra&s;s. His Wife had been ju&s;t reading a Book of her Husband's print|ing,
concerning <HI>Jane Wenham,</HI> the famous Witch of <HI>Hartford,</HI> and her
Mind mi&s;gave her that he was bewitch'd; but he &s;oon let her know
that he &s;u&s;pected <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> and recounted to her, between the Inter|vals
of his Yawnings and Reachings, every Circum&s;tance of his In|terview
with Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> in the mean Time coming in, was extremely afright|ed
at the &s;udden Alteration he ob&s;erved in him: <HI>Brother</HI> Curll, &s;ays he,
<HI>I fear you have got the vomiting Di&s;temper, which (I have heard) kills
in half an Hour. This comes from your not following my Advice, to
drink old Hock as I do, and ab&s;tain from Sack.</HI> Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> reply'd, in
a moving Tone, <HI>Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Bu&s;ine&s;s.
Z<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ds,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Lintott, My Author!&mdash;Why did not you drink
old Hock?</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which rough Remon&s;trance, he did in the
mo&s;t friendly Manner pre&s;s him to take warm Water; but Mr.
<HI>Curll</HI> did with great Ob&s;tinacy refu&s;e it; which made Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>
infer, that he cho&s;e to die, as thinking to recover greater Da|mages.</P>
<P>All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd violently, with acute Pains
in the lower Belly. <HI>Brother</HI> Lintott, &s;ays he, <HI>I perceive my la&s;t Hour
approaching, do me the friendly Office to call my Partner, Mr.</HI> Pember|ton,
<HI>that we may &s;ettle our Worldly Affairs.</HI> Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> like a kind
Neighbour, was ha&s;tening out of the Room, while Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> rav'd
aloud in this Manner, <HI>If I &s;urvive this, I will be revenged on</HI> Ton&s;on<HI>,
it was he fir&s;t detected me as the Printer of the&s;e Poems, and I will re|print
the&s;e very Poems in his Name.</HI> His Wife admoni&s;h'd him not to
think of Revenge, but to take care of his Stock and his Soul: And
in the &s;ame In&s;tant, Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> (who&s;e Goodne&s;s can never be e|nough
applauded) return'd with Mr. <HI>Pemberton.</HI> After &s;ome Tears
jointly &s;hed by the&s;e Humane Book&s;ellers, Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> being (as he
&s;aid) in his perfect Sen&s;es though in great bodily Pain, immedi|ately
proceeded to make a verbal Will (Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI> having fir&s;t
put on his Night Cap) in the following Manner.</P>
<Q><PB N="4" REF="4"><P>GENTLEMEN, in the fir&s;t Place, I do &s;incerely pray Forgive|ne&s;s
for tho&s;e indirect Methods I have pur&s;ued in inventing
new Titles to old Books, putting Authors Names to Things they ne|ver
&s;aw, publi&s;hing private Quarrels for publick Entertainment;
all which, I hope will be pardoned, as being done to get an hone&s;t
livelihood.</P>
<P>I do al&s;o heartily beg Pardon of all Per&s;ons of Honour, Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, Gentry, Burge&s;&s;es, and Commonalty, to
who&s;e Abu&s;e I have any, or every way, contributed by my Publicati|ons.
Particularly, I hope it will be con&s;idered, that if I have vilify'd
his Grace the Duke of <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">gh,</HI> I have likewi&s;e a&s;pers'd the late
Duke of <HI>O<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI>; if I have abu&s;ed the honourable Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">le,</HI>
I have al&s;o libell'd the late Lord <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ke</HI>; &s;o that I have pre|&s;erv'd
that Equality and Impartiality which becomes an hone&s;t Man
in Times of Faction and Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>I call my Con&s;cience to Witne&s;s, that many of the&s;e Things which may
&s;eem malicious, were done out of Charity; I having made it wholly my
Bu&s;ine&s;s to print for poor di&s;con&s;olate Authors, whom all other Book&s;ellers
refu&s;e: Only God ble&s;s Sir <HI>Richard Bl<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">re</HI>; you know he takes no
Copy Money.</P>
<P>The Book of the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the <HI>Earl of N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">m,</HI> is yet unpubli&s;h|ed;
as you are to have the Profit of it, Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> you are to run
the Ri&s;que of the Re&s;entments of all that Noble Family. Indeed I cau|&s;ed
the Author to a&s;&s;ert &s;everal Things in it as Facts, which are only
idle Stories of the Town; becau&s;e I thought it would make the Book
&s;ell. Do you pay the Author for Copy Money, and the Printer and
Publi&s;her. I heartily beg God's, and my L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">m</HI>'s Pardon;
but all Trades mu&s;t live.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Collection of Poems, which I groundle&s;ly called Mr.
<HI>Prior</HI>'s, will &s;ell for Nothing, and hath not yet paid the Charge of the
Adverti&s;ements, which I was obliged to publi&s;h again&s;t him: There|fore
you may as well &s;uppre&s;s the Edition, and beg that Gentleman's
Pardon in the Name of a dying Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The <HI>French Cato,</HI> with the Critici&s;m, &s;howing how &s;uperior it is to
Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s, (which I wickedly in&s;cribed to Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>) may be
&s;uppre&s;s'd at a rea&s;onable Rate, being damnably tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t I have no Animo&s;ity to Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI> having printed Part of his
<HI>Callipaedia,</HI> and an incorrect Edition of his Poems without his Leave, in
Quarto. Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI>'s <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI>; or <HI>Bays the Younger,</HI> did more harm to
me than to Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI>; though upon the Faith of an hone&s;t Man, I paid
him double for abu&s;ing both him and Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven pardon me for publi&s;hing the <HI>Trials of Sodomy</HI> in an <HI>Elzevir</HI>
Letter; but I humbly hope, my printing Sir <HI>Richard Bl<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">re</HI>'s E&s;&s;ays
will attone for them. I beg that you will take what remains of the&s;e
la&s;t, which is near the whole Impre&s;&s;ion, (Pre&s;ents excepted) and let
<PB N="5" REF="5">
my poor Widow have in Exchange the &s;ole Propriety of the Copy of
Madam <HI>Ma&s;cranny.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> interrupted, and would by no Means con&s;ent to this
Article, about which &s;ome Di&s;pute might have ari&s;en, unbecoming a dying
Per&s;on, if Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> had not interpo&s;ed, and Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> vomited.</P>
<P>What this poor unfortunate Man &s;poke afterwards, was &s;o indi&s;tinct, and in
&s;uch broken Accents, (being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings) that the
Reader is intreated to excu&s;e the Confu&s;ion and Imperfection of this Ac|count.</P>
<Q><P>Dear Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> I beg you to beware of the Indictment at
<HI>Hicks's-Hall,</HI> for publi&s;hing <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s bawdy Poems; that Copy will,
otherwi&s;e be my be&s;t Legacy to my dear Wife, and helple&s;s Child.</P></Q>
<P><HI>The Ca&s;e of Impotence</HI> was my be&s;t Support all the la&s;t long Vacation.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Paragraph Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Voice grew more free, for his Vomitings
abated upon his Dejections, and he &s;poke what follows from his Clo&s;e-&s;tole.</P>
<Q><P>For the Copies of Noblemen's and Bi&s;hop's <HI>La&s;t Wills and Te&s;taments,</HI>
I &s;olemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpo&s;e of Defamation;
but meerly as I thought tho&s;e Copies lawfully purcha&s;ed from <HI>Doctors
Commons,</HI> at <HI>One Shilling</HI> a Piece. Our Trade in Wills turning to &s;mall
Account, we may divide them blindfold.</P>
<P>For Mr. <HI>Manwaring</HI>'s <HI>Life,</HI> I ask Mrs. <HI>Old<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI>'s Pardon: Neither
<HI>His,</HI> nor my Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s Lives, though they were of great Service
to their Country, were of any to me: But I was re&s;olved, &s;ince I could
not print their Works while they liv'd, to print their Lives after they
were dead.</P></Q>
<P>While he was &s;peaking the&s;e Words, Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> enter'd. <HI>Ah!
Mr.</HI> Oldmixon (&s;aid poor Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>) <HI>to what a Condition have your Works
reduced me! I die a Martyr to that unlucky Preface. However, in the&s;e my
la&s;t Moments, I will be ju&s;t to all Men; you &s;hall have your Third Share of
the</HI> Court Poems<HI>, as was &s;tipulated. When I am dead, where will you find
another Book&s;eller? Your</HI> Prote&s;tant Packet <HI>might have &s;upported you, had
you writ a little le&s;s &s;currilou&s;ly, There is a mean in all things.</HI></P>
<P>Then turning to Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> he told him, he had &s;everal <HI>Taking
Title Pages</HI> that only wanted Treati&s;es to be wrote to them, and earne&s;t|ly
entreated, that when they were writ, his Heirs might have &s;ome
Share of the Profit of them.</P>
<P>After he had &s;aid this he fell into horrible Gripings, upon which Mr.
<HI>Lintott</HI> advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer. He de&s;ir'd his Wife to
&s;tep into the Shop for a Common-Prayer-Book, and read it by the Help
of a Candle, without He&s;itation. He clos'd the Book, fetch'd a Groan,
and recommended to Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI> to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of
the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI>'s, and a Week's Wages Advance to each of his
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Gentlemen Authors, with &s;ome &s;mall Gratuity in particular to Mrs.
<HI>Centlivre.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Man continued for &s;ome Hours with all his di&s;con&s;olate
Family about him in Tears, expecting his final Di&s;&s;olution; when of
a &s;udden he was &s;urprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid Stool, which
obliged them all to retire out of the Room. Notwith&s;tanding, it is
judged by Sir <HI>Richard Bl<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e,</HI> that the Poy&s;on is &s;till latent in his
Body, and will infallibly de&s;troy him by &s;low Degrees, in le&s;s than a
Month. It is to be hoped the other Enemies of this wretched Statio|ner,
will not further pur&s;ue their Revenge, or &s;horten this &s;mall Peri|od
of his mi&s;erable Life.</P>
