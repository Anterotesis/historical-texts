<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE
The MAYOR and ALDERMEN of the
City of <HI>LONDON:</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>The Humble Petition
Of the Colliers, <HI>Cooks, Cook-Maids, Black|&s;miths,</HI>
<HI>Jack-makers, Bra&s;iers,</HI> and Others,</HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH;</OPENER>
<P>_THAT whereas certain <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> Di&s;affected to the Government, and
to the Trade and Pro&s;perity of this Kingdom, taking upon them
the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS, have
pre&s;umed, by Gathering, Breaking, Folding, and Bundling up the
Sun-Beams, by the help of certain <HI>Gla&s;&s;es,</HI> to Make, Produce, and
Kindle up &s;everal New <HI>Focus's</HI> or Fires within the&s;e His Maje&s;ty's
Dominions, and thereby to Boil, Bake, Stew, Fry, and Dre&s;s all &s;orts of Victuals
and Provi&s;ions, to Brew, Di&s;til Spirits, Smelt Oars, and, in general, to perform
all the Offices of Culinary Fires; and are endeavouring to procure to them&s;elves
the Monopoly of this their &s;aid Invention. We beg leave humbly to repre&s;ent to
your Honours,</P>
<P>That &s;uch Grant or Patent will utterly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ain and reduce to Beggary your Peti|tioners,
their Wives, Children, Servants, and Trades on them depending; there
being nothing left to them, after the &s;aid Invention, but Warming of Cellars and
Dre&s;&s;ing of Suppers in the Winter-time. That the aboli&s;hing &s;o con&s;iderable a
branch of the Coa&s;ting Trade as that of the Colliers, will de&s;troy the Navigation
of this Kingdom. That whereas the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> talk of making
u&s;e of the <HI>Moon</HI> by Night, as of the <HI>Sun</HI> by Day, they will utterly ruin the
numerous Body of Tallow-Chandlers, and impair a very con&s;iderable branch of
the Revenue which ari&s;es from the Tax upon Tallow and Candles.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> do profane the Emanations of that Glorious
Luminary the <HI>Sun,</HI> which is appointed to <HI>Rule the Day,</HI> and not to <HI>Roa&s;t Mutton.</HI>
And we humbly conceive, It will be found contrary to the known Laws of this
Kingdom, to Confine, Fore&s;tall, and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun. And
whereas the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI> have undertaken, by Burning-Gla&s;&s;es made
of Ice, to Roa&s;t an Ox upon the <HI>Thames</HI> next Winter: We conceive all &s;uch
Practices to be an Encroachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the Company
of <HI>Watermen.</HI></P>
<P>That the Diver&s;ity of Expo&s;ition of the &s;everal Kitchins in this great City,
whereby &s;ome receive the Rays of the Sun &s;ooner, and others later, will occa&s;ion
great Irregularity as to the Time of Dining of the &s;everal Inhabitants, and con&s;e|quently
great Uncertainty and Confu&s;ion in the di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s: And to tho&s;e
who, by rea&s;on of their Northern Expo&s;ition, will be &s;till forced to be at the Ex|pences
of Culinary Fires, it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to &s;uch
Inequality as is incon&s;i&s;tent with common Ju&s;tice: And the &s;ame Inconveniency
will affect Landlords in the Value of their Rents.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">
That the U&s;e of the &s;aid Gla&s;&s;es will oblige Cooks and Cook-Maids to &s;tudy
Opticks and A&s;tronomy, in order to know the due Di&s;tances of the &s;aid <HI>Focus's</HI>
or Fires, and to adju&s;t the Po&s;ition of their Gla&s;&s;es to the &s;everal Altitudes of the
Sun, varying according to the Hours of the Day, and the Sea&s;ons of the Year;
which Studies, at the&s;e Years, will be highly Trouble&s;ome to the &s;aid Cooks and
Cook-Maids, not to &s;ay any thing of the utter Incapacity of &s;ome of them to go
through with &s;uch difficult Arts; or (which is &s;till a greater Inconveniency) it
will throw the whole Art of <HI>Cookery</HI> into the Hands of A&s;tronomers and Gla&s;s-Grinders,
Per&s;ons utterly unskill'd in other parts of that Profe&s;&s;ion, to the great
Detriment of the Health of His Maje&s;ty's good Subjects.</P>
<P>That it is known by Experience, That Meat Roa&s;ted with Sun-Beams is ex|treamly
unwhole&s;ome; witne&s;s &s;everal that have dy'd &s;uddenly after eating the
Provi&s;ions of the &s;aid <HI>Catoptrical Victuallers</HI>; being that the Sun-Beams taken
inwardly, render the Humours too Hot and Adu&s;t, occa&s;ion great Sweatings,
and dry up the Rectual Moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>That Sun-Beams taken inwardly, &s;hed a Malignant Influence upon the Brain,
by their natural Tendency towards the Moon; produce Madne&s;s and De&s;traction
at the time of the Full Moon. That the con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;o great Quantities of
this Inward Light, will occa&s;ion the Growth of Quakeri&s;m, to the Danger of the
Church; and Poetry, to the Danger of the State.</P>
<P>That the Influences of the Con&s;tellations, through which the Sun pa&s;&s;es, will,
with his Beams, be convey'd into the Blood; and when the Sun is among&s;t the
Horned Signs, may produce &s;uch a Spirit of Uncha&s;tity, as is dangerous to the
Honour of your Wor&s;hips Families.</P>
<P>That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other parts of Plants, the&s;e
being impregnated with the Sun-Beams, may vegetate and grow in the Bowels,
a Thing of more dangerous Con&s;equence to Human Bodies than Breeding of
Worms; and this will fall heavie&s;t upon the Poor, who live upon Roots; and the
Weak and Sickly, who live upon Barley and Rue-Gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which we are
ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Phy&s;icians, That the
Ta&s;te and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the wor&s;e by the &s;aid <HI>Solar
Cookery,</HI> the Frica&s;&s;es being depriv'd of the <HI>Haut Gout</HI> they acquire by being dre&s;s'd
over Charcoal.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Should it happen by an Eclip&s;e of an Extraordinary Length, that this
City &s;hould be depriv'd of the Sun-Beams for &s;everal Months; how will His Ma|je&s;ty's
Subjects &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the Interim, when common Cookery, with the Arts de|pending
upon it, is totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In Con&s;ideration of the&s;e, and many other inconveniences, your Petitioners
humbly pray, That your Honours would either totally prohibit the Con|fining
and Manufacturing the Sun-Beams for any of the u&s;eful Purpo&s;es
of Life, or in the en&s;uing Parliament procure a Tax to be laid upon them,
which may an&s;wer both the Duty and Price of Coals, and which we humbly
conceive cannot be le&s;s than Thirty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard Square, re&s;erving
the &s;ole Right and Privilege of the <HI>Catoptrical Cookery</HI> to the <HI>Royal Socie|ty,</HI>
and to the Commanders and Crew of the Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els, under the Di|rection
of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton,</HI> for finding out the Longitude, who by Rea|&s;on
of the Remotene&s;s of their Nations, may be reduc'd to Streights for
want of Firing.</P>
<P>And we likewi&s;e beg that your Honours, as to the forementioned
Points, would hear the Reverend Mr. <HI>Flam&s;ted,</HI> who is the Legal
Officer appointed by the Government to <HI>look after the Heavenly
Luminaries,</HI> whom we have con&s;tituted our Tru&s;ty and Learned
Solicitor.</P>
