<P>THis Dedication is not &s;o much a Compliment to your

of their own Happine&s;s under your gentle Government, or
&s;o blind to their own Intere&s;t as to forfeit your Favour by
any breach of their Duty; &s;o they cannot doubt of the full
Performance on your Maje&s;ty's part, of all that your Ma|je&s;ty
has been graciou&s;ly pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure them of under the
Sanction of your Royal Word.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The Toleration of their religious Liberty has been &s;e|cur'd
to them by Law; and your Maje&s;ty has been pleas'd
to add to the Force of that Law your Royal Word, that it
&s;hall be inviolably pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting Subjects lay at
your Feet the following Relation, with all Humility appeal|ing
to your Royal Judgment, whether both their Toleration
is not herein violently invaded, and your Maje&s;ty's Honour
and &s;acred Promi&s;e at lea&s;t attempted to be violated in the
illegal arbitrary Methods made u&s;e of to oppre&s;s one of
their Mini&s;ters, and &s;uppre&s;s an A&s;&s;embly of &s;everal Hun|dreds
of your Loyal and Peaceable Di&s;&s;enting Subjects.</P>
<P>They remon&s;trate, and in the humble&s;t manner Com|plain
to your Maje&s;ty of the Violence and horrid Practices
made u&s;e of to Defame, Per&s;ecute, Impri&s;on and Ruin a
Man, who&s;e principal vi&s;ible Crime is Serving God ac|cording
to his Con&s;cience, and Teaching the &s;ame to others.
They humbly pre&s;ent them&s;elves at your Royal Feet, as

in this Book is po&s;itively and exactly conformable to Truth
and direct Meaning, being at all times ready to come forth
and confront, even in your Royal Pre&s;ence, all the Allega|tions
to the contrary.</P>
<P>Having thus publickly appeal'd to God and your Maje|&s;ty,
they can no longer Doubt either of the Ble&s;&s;ing from

appre&s;t Innocence and Virtue in all Nations, &s;o they doubt
not but your own Subjects &s;hall yet have the Honour and
Happine&s;s of your powerful Protection as far as Ju&s;tice

for their differing in Judgment from &s;ome few
Points profe&s;s'd and practis'd by the Church of <HI>England</HI>
of which your Maje&s;ty is the glorious Head, &s;ince the
Evils they complain of are &s;uffer'd not from the Church

of the Prote&s;tant Religion in general, and to the

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the unhappy Differences between the High-Church Party
and the Di&s;&s;enters, it has happen'd, as it generally does in
all Heats and Animo&s;ities of Parties, that both Sides pretend
to be in the right, and both pretend to be abus'd by the
other.</P>
<P>The warm Men of the Church have charg'd the Di&s;&s;enters with
A&s;&s;ociating to De&s;troy and Undermine the Church. How they
have made good their Charge, is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Paper,
and has been examin'd el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters charge the other with In&s;ulting them, Per&s;ecu|ting
them, and Invading their Toleration.</P>
<P>Great Endeavours have been us'd to defend the Occa&s;ional Bills
from a Charge of Per&s;ecution: and whether they have done that
or no, we need not di&s;pute, but refer to the Conferences on
that Head between the Hou&s;es, and which are publi&s;h'd in Print.</P>
<P>But to leave all doubtful Ca&s;es to &s;tand and fall by the Force of
their own Truth, I cannot think the World ought to be ignorant
of the following Story; that all unbya&s;s'd People may &s;ee, by
this Specimen, what the&s;e Gentlemen would do with the Di&s;&s;en|ters
if it lay in their power, and how ju&s;tly they have been
charg'd with de&s;igns to Hang, Bani&s;h, and De&s;troy the Di&s;&s;enters,
and reward their Mini&s;ters with the Gallows and the Galleys.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I am going to pre&s;ent the World with a new
<HI>Devil of Loudon,</HI> with a Story &s;o black in all its Parts, &s;o much the
Picture of Hell, and &s;o aggravated with inhumane and unchri|&s;tian
Circum&s;tances, that all that read it mu&s;t blu&s;h for their Native
Country, to think &s;uch unheard-of Villanies could be acted in it,
Crimes &s;o abhorr'd by Mankind, that tho' they call them&s;elves
of the Church, we &s;hall find all the true Members of the Church,
whether Judges, Ju&s;tices, Bi&s;hops, yea even Jaylors them&s;elves,
abhorring it: while, I &s;ay, I have &s;uch a Scene before me, and
knowing what &s;ort of People I have to do with, I &s;hall take &s;uch an
<PB N="2" REF="7">
exact care to have every thing that is here advanc'd &s;o atte&s;ted with
undeniable Evidence, that Impudence it &s;elf, not the helli&s;h Actors,
not the blinde&s;t Advocates, not the Devil him&s;elf, &s;hall dare to
Reply to it.</P>
<P>Slander and Lies fly befoe Truth as Mi&s;t before the Sun;
and this helli&s;h A&s;&s;ociation, form'd again&s;t an innocent Man, tho'
laid as deep as Hell, and pro&s;ecuted thro' all the barbarous Ex|tremes
of Forgery, Perjury, Violence, Subornation, In&s;ults, and
Revenge, yet at la&s;t all dwindles away before Truth: Inno|cence
breaks out like the Sun thro' a dark Cloud, the Light
of Truth is &s;o clear, that Devils &s;hun it, Mon&s;ters fly from it, and
Men of Guilt and Blood hide their Heads at its appearance.</P>
<P>And as I &s;hould not have attempted this Relation, had I not had
good and undoubted Te&s;timony of the Truth of every Article, &s;o
I write with the greater A&s;&s;urance, &s;ince I can frankly defie the
mo&s;t harden'd Advocate of &s;uch a wretched Cau&s;e to confront the
lea&s;t or minute&s;t Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Such direct Te&s;timony, &s;uch ju&s;t Authorities, &s;uch authentick
Proofs of every Article, are before me, that no Man could ever
de&s;ire to have his Reputation vindicated with more. Clearne&s;s in
the Face of the Sun.</P>
<P>As for the Treatment this poor injur'd Man has met with, I
would be glad the wor&s;t Enemy in the Nation would give it a
Name, and tell us, wiht &s;ome little Rea&s;on at the &s;ame time,
what to call it.</P>
<P>I would have them rummage <HI>Fox</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Popi&s;h Per&s;e|cutions,
and tell us where they can match the U&s;age this Man has
met with; and let us know where ever Bi&s;hop <HI>Gardiner,</HI> or bloo|dy
<HI>Bonner,</HI> acted like The&s;e Men.</P>
<P>Let them &s;hew us &s;uch an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Magi&s;trate as Par&s;on
<HI>Eern,</HI> and where ever Engli&s;h-men have been thus treated.</P>
<P>Well might the Parliament pa&s;s a Bill to qualifie Ju&s;tices of the
Peace. If this be the fruit of putting Church Par&s;ons into Com|mi&s;&s;ions
of the Peace, never let <HI>Hudibras</HI> tell us of the Cobler of
<HI>New-England,</HI> who
<Q><L>Serv'd his Country in a double</L>
<L>Capacity, to Preach and Cobble.</L></Q></P>
<P>To let the Reader gradually into this black Story, it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to inform him, that in &s;everal publick Printed Books, as well
as in common Di&s;cour&s;e, the Town has been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Sto|ry
of a Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter in the <HI>I&s;le of Ely,</HI> who fir&s;t forg'd Epi&s;|copal
<PB N="3" REF="8">
Orders, and preach'd in the Church; but being detected
in that, pretended Cla&s;&s;ical Ordination, and &s;et up a Conventicle;
but being pro&s;ecuted as a &s;candalous Fellow, having two or three
Wives, four or five Ba&s;tards, having once broke out of <HI>Derby</HI>
Jayl, play'd a great many villainous Pranks, and being a com|mon
Drunkard and Swearer, the Ju&s;tices took him up as a Vaga|bond,
li&s;ted him for a Soldier, and &s;ent him away to <HI>Cambridge,</HI>
where having been Arre&s;ted for Debt, and thereby got out of the
Officer's hands: &s;ome Complaints being made by the Di&s;&s;enters at
the Inju&s;tice of this&mdash;The Party greet them, by way of An&s;wer,
with prodigious Calumnies, and in&s;olent Reproaches of the Man
him&s;elf, to vindicate the mo&s;t villainous unheard-of Proceedings
that ever this Nation knew.</P>
<P>And as the abominable In&s;olence of their Actions happen'd to
receive a due Cen&s;ure from the be&s;t Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and
of the mo&s;t un&s;potted Character this Age has known; let us
&s;ee how this Per&s;on, as well as the poor Sufferer, is treated on
this account by that Man of Fury and Satyr, Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> in the Pre|face
to his Lampoon, call'd, <HI>Moderation Di&s;play'd.</HI></P>
<P>Inveighing again&s;t our Men of Moderation in the Church, he
&s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Nay, &s;o tender are they of their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren, that
I am told it has lately been delivered as Law by a great Man in
<HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">hall,</HI> That a notorious perjur'd Vagabond, with two
Wives at once, being po&s;&s;e&s;t of a &s;eparate Congregation, tho'
without any Licence or legal Qualification to preach to them,
&s;hall, for that rea&s;on only, be exempt from the late Act for
Li&s;ting Vagrants."</Q></P>
<P>Now if, upon reading the&s;e Sheets, it &s;hould <HI>&s;o fall out,</HI> that af|ter
all that has been done or &s;aid to or of this poor injur'd Man,
it &s;hould appear too plain for the mo&s;t harden'd Lampooner or
mo&s;t impudent Church-Ju&s;tice to deny, that this is all Malice, For|gery,
and Inju&s;tice, and, as all the Judges of the Queen's-Bench
expre&s;t it, the deepe&s;t Track of Villainy that ever came before
them; What will the&s;e Men &s;ay for them&s;elves, and how will they
make Satisfaction to God or Man, to the affronted Di&s;&s;enters, to
their own expos'd Party, and to the poor injur'd Man that has
been inhumanely treated?</P>
<P>If, after all their Clamour and barbarous Orders, I make it ap|pear,
that this Man never broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> or any other Jayl,
never forg'd any Orders, but was fairly ordain'd by a Church of
<HI>England</HI> Bi&s;hop, ws never Perjur'd, or a Vagabond, had never
two Wives at once, nor any Ba&s;tards, was never &s;een to be Drunk,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
or known to Swear; but that, on the contrary, has been always
a &s;ober, vertuous, and peaceable Liver, a con&s;tant Re&s;ident at his
Cure for eleven or twelve Years together, a Man of Charity
and good Conver&s;ation, and, in &s;hort, not in the lea&s;t guilty of
one of the Crimes charg'd on him, but that it has been all For|gery,
Malice, and Con&s;piracy to ruin him, meerly for his quitting
the Church, and turning to the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould happen to be made out, as I fairly undertake it
&s;hall, I crave Leave to draw the&s;e two Inferences;</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who too ha&s;tily believ'd, and too readily
handed on the Clamours and Slanders again&s;t an innoceut Man,
through who&s;e Sides they were all wounded and aim'd it, ought to
acknowledge their want of Con&s;ideration and Caution. 'Tis true,
it may be &s;aid, in their Excu&s;e, they could not have imagin'd the
Earth had borne &s;uch Mon&s;ters, and that &s;uch a Cloud of Cla|mours
could never be all forg'd; and therefore, in Charity to
the Church-men, they were drawn in to Cen&s;ure an Innocent Man,
for which they ought to ask his Pardon; and re&s;toring him to
their ju&s;t Opinion, more diligently guard, for the future, his
injur'd Reputation.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Forgers of all this, and the Authors of a Treat|ment
too foul to relate, and blacker than the Ink I write it
with, I leave their Character to &s;ea&s;on the Pallate of the Rea|der,
after he has been fill'd with Horror at &s;ome of the mo&s;t
villainous Actions the World ever heard of. The Matter of Fact is
as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>The CASE of Mr. <HI>ABRAHAM GILL, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ABraham Gill,</HI> the Subject of the en&s;uing Tragedy, was a Mini|&s;ter
of the Church of <HI>England</HI>; He was born in <HI>Rivington</HI> in the
County of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> had his Education partly among the Di&s;|&s;enters,
but la&s;t of all in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he
commenc'd Batchelor of Arts of <HI>Brazen-No&s;e</HI> College.</P>
<P>From whence Conforming to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he en|tred
into Holy Orders, and was admitted by the pre&s;ent Right.
Reverend the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>And becau&s;e his Enemies have had the face to Charge him with
forging the Bi&s;hop's Orders, We think it nece&s;&s;ary, that we may
clear every thing as we go along, having abundance of dark things
to expo&s;e and Helli&s;h Conduct to lay open, to draw this Scene
<PB N="5" REF="10">
before we proceed, and to tell them, that the very Original Or|ders,
Signed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>'s own Hand, and Seal'd with
his Seal, is left with the re&s;t of the Vouchers of this horrid Tran&s;|action,
at Mr. <HI>John Skey</HI>'s Tobacconi&s;t, at the <HI>Black-boy and Three
Tobacco-pipes</HI> at <HI>Queenhithe,</HI> where all the World, Friends or Ene|mies,
are promi&s;ed a free and uninterrupted Opportunity to &s;ee
them, and detect the Forgeries if they are to be found.</P>
<P>And that it may not be alledg'd, this Freedom of offering a
&s;ight of the Originals is but a pre&s;umptive Proof, &s;uppo&s;ing no
Man will trouble him&s;elf to examine them, (<HI>tho' the Willingne&s;s of
&s;ome Gentlemen to expo&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters in this hone&s;t Man's Cau&s;e
&s;ugge&s;ts otherwi&s;e</HI>) yet eternally to &s;top the Mouth of the mo&s;t
prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd Malice, a Reverend Clergy-man of their own Church
is to be found, hone&s;t enough to do Ju&s;tice to an injur'd Man,
and give a Sanction to the Truth.</P>
<P>This Gentleman is one who entred into Orders with Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
and five Mini&s;ters more at the &s;ame time, and has hone&s;tly &s;worn
it: which Affidavit is left al&s;o with the re&s;t of the Vouchers at the
Place afore&s;aid. And now if the&s;e Orders are Counterfeit or
Forg'd, it may fairly be &s;een, and Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> be expos'd; but if
not, let the World match the villainous U&s;age this poor Man has
met with, if they can.</P>
<P>After this Demon&s;tration of the Certainty and undoubted Truth
of his Orders, 'tis humbly de&s;ir'd of all tho&s;e Gentlemen that
&s;hall for the future charge him with forging Epi&s;copal Orders,
that they would be pleas'd to &s;hew their Faces, that we may
&s;ee if they do not blu&s;h; and that they would tell us their Names,
that after &s;ome few Examples of this &s;ort made for Satisfaction to
Ju&s;tice and the Law out of the great Number of tho&s;e that are al|ready
detected, they may be recorded, as they de&s;erve, among
tho&s;e that <HI>bear fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t their Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed to the Hi&s;tory of Mr. <HI>Gill:</HI> After he had thus
enter'd into Orders, he preach'd as Curate at <HI>Maney</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of
Ely,</HI> about 12 Miles from <HI>Wisbich.</HI></P>
<P>While he Officiated in this Place, he was well receiv'd and
belov'd of his Congregation; and we never find any Complaint
made of him, &s;ave that he &s;et an ill Example to his Neighbours
of the Clergy, by invading the Cu&s;tom of the Country, and
Preaching twice a day to the People.</P>
<P>Having been two Years in <HI>Maney,</HI> he received an Invitation
from the Inhabitants of <HI>Welney,</HI> or <HI>Welneth,</HI> a Hamlet in the Pari&s;h
of <HI>Upwell</HI> in the &s;ame County, to preach in a certain Privileg'd
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Independent Chapel in this Pari&s;h; the Right of the Place em|powering
the Inhabitants to choo&s;e their own Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>After long and earne&s;t Sollicitations from the Inhabitants of
<HI>Wilney,</HI> and with the Con&s;ent of his former Hearers, he agreed
to go to <HI>Wilney,</HI> and accordingly went and &s;ettled with his Family
in the Par&s;onage-hou&s;e or Tenement belonging to the &s;aid Chapel.</P>
<P>The Freedom with which the Inhabitants of <HI>Wilney</HI> invited
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to be their Curate, appear'd in their chearful a&s;&s;i&s;ting
him in his Removal thither, and preparing a Fea&s;t for his Recep|tion;
all the Neighbours in general meeting him to bid him
Welcome.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight or Three-weeks after his Settlement at <HI>Wil|ney,</HI>
the Reverend Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> came to pay him
a Vi&s;it, thank'd him for coming to the &s;aid Chapel, and decla|red
that he was glad his Pari&s;hioners were like to be &s;o well &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>In this Chapel Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> continued about &s;even Years, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the Year 1695 to the Year 1702, Preaching twice a day, and Con|forming
in all things to the U&s;age of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But
in proce&s;s of Time being di&s;&s;atisfied in his Con&s;cience at the U&s;e of
the Liturgy, he began at &s;everal times to omit &s;uch part of the Ser|vice
as he di&s;lik'd; till at la&s;t his Scruples encrea&s;ing, he wholly o|mitted
the Common Prayer, applying him&s;elf only to the Pulpit,
and conceiving he was not under equal Obligation as if Preaching
in a Pari&s;h-Church, the Chapel he preach'd in being wholly In|dependent,
a Privileg'd Place, and in the Power of the People.</P>
<P>As this was the Original of all the &s;ub&s;equent Malice of the
Church-Clergy, and of the barbarous Proceedings of which we
are to give an Account; &s;o they are hereby fairly challeng'd to
produce one Shadow of a Crime in his Behaviour, which, Humane
Frailty excepted, appears wholly blamele&s;s, and which we &s;hall
produce &s;uch Te&s;timonials to ju&s;tifie, as few of the Clergy of
the Church can produce more, and &s;uch as indeed no hone&s;t
Man need de&s;ire better.</P>
<P>If this Offence were as great as they would &s;uppo&s;e it to be,
it yet admits of much to be &s;aid in Extenuation; as, I. His
Scruples of Con&s;cience, which would not permit him to continue
the Exerci&s;e of the Common Prayer and Ceremonies, at lea&s;t
not in all parts; 2. His officiating in a private Independent Chapel,
in which, as before, he thought him&s;elf not oblig'd to an exact

<P>But, to oblige our Adver&s;ary, we'll &s;uppo&s;e it as heinous a
Crime as they can pretend to, yet they will have enough to do
<PB N="7" REF="12">
to make it out that their Proceedings with him have been legal, ra|tional,
ju&s;t, or humane: And for the Truth of this Sugge&s;tion,
we refer to the Particulars, and freely make all unprejudic'd
Members of their own Church the Judges: this Independency of
the Chapel of <HI>Wilney</HI> will in &s;ome mea&s;ure appear as follows.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> under&s;tanding that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
omitted the Common Prayer, came to him, and told him, he was
&s;orry he (Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>) did not hold to his Principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that
he mu&s;t therefore di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him, and put in another Curate.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> replied, He was not, nor ever had been, his Cu|rate,
and that it was not in his (Dr. <HI>Gregg</HI>'s) Power to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s
him; and therewith Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> &s;hew'd the Doctor <HI>his Authority for
holding</HI> the Place, which &s;atisfied Dr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> &s;o that he never of|fer'd
him the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance afterward.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time Dr. <HI>Gregg</HI> died, and the Rectory of <HI>Upwell</HI> was
given to one Mr. <HI>Hubbart</HI>; but he being a weakly Man, and in
a deep Con&s;umption, he put in a Curate to Officiate; <HI>viz.</HI> one
Mr. <HI>Hugh James.</HI></P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding his Pari&s;hioners flocking after Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
and but few caring to hear him, he expre&s;t his Di&s;plea&s;ure fre|quently
in threatning and malicious Speeches again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; but
the Incumbent Mr. <HI>Hubbart</HI> being a pious and peaceable Man,
would not permit him to mole&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> during his Life: but this
was not long; for, in about a Year and a half the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Hub|bart,</HI>
the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> died, and the Living was then given
to the &s;aid Curate, Mr. <HI>Hugh James.</HI></P>
<P>As this Mr. <HI>James</HI> was a Man both of a different Temper and
Character from his two hone&s;t Predece&s;&s;ors, he re&s;olv'd to &s;train
his Authority to the utmo&s;t, in order to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step he took in this Undertaking, was that about the <GAP DESC="blank">
He comes to <HI>Wilney</HI> on a Lord's-day, and
demands the Pulpit for the morning: Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> quietly permit|ted
him to Preach; which he did, or rather Rail, at an uncom|mon
rate, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> bending his whole Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;et
out the heinous Sin of Omitting the holy Ceremonies, and telling
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> from the Pulpit, that he ought to lie at the Chapel-door
for three or four Months in Sackcloth, not daring to tread up|on
that Con&s;ecrated Ground, begging the People to pray to
God for him to forgive him that Sin: and to prove this, quo|ted,
as we are told, &s;everal Popi&s;h Writers, but not one Text
of Scripture as can be remembred; running on in &s;uch a virulent
Stile and un&s;uitable manner, that many of the Inhabitants could
not bear to hear him, but went out of the Chapel.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">
In the Afternoon there was no Sermon; for the &s;aid Mr.
<HI>James,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> gave notice to the People to meet him
after Dinner at an Alehou&s;e, where he Treated them with Li|quor,
and, as a place more proper for the Subject, preach'd the
Second Part to his Morning Sermon, and be&s;tow'd another plenti|ful
&s;torm of ill Language on Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> de&s;iring the Inhabitants to
&s;et their Hands to a Letter, Petition, or Paper written to the
<HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> in order to get Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> turn'd out: But they all unani|mou&s;ly
refus'd him.</P>
<P>Being di&s;appointed in his Expectations, and having &s;pent his

that very Night to <HI>Ely,</HI> and the next Week to <HI>London,</HI> to com|plain
again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Wilney</HI> having di&s;covered the De&s;ign, and
being very loth to part with their Mini&s;ter, importun'd Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>

prevent Mr. <HI>James</HI> from obtaining his malicious De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> at the De&s;ire of his Congregation, did draw up the

the Po&s;t) who receiv'd it, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, before the &s;aid Mr.

<P>Soon after the Arrival of the Petition, the Rector Mr. <HI>James</HI>
came up to the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and makes his Complaint again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
de&s;iring he might be di&s;mi&s;t: but his Lord&s;hip (as Mr. <HI>James</HI>
him&s;elf has reported) an&s;wer'd, That he had heard a very good
Report of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> from his Neighbourhood, That by the
Right of the Place the Choice of a Mini&s;ter was in the Inhabi|tants,
and they te&s;tifying to his Behaviour, he could not di&s;mi&s;s
him, or credit the Accu&s;ation of one Man again&s;t the unanimous
Voice of the whole Town, or Words to that effect. But, in
&s;hort, he rejected the Reque&s;t of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and refus'd to Cen|&s;ure
or Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed here, applies him&s;elf to
the Spiritual Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and about <HI>May</HI> 1702 procures a
Citation again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to appear at <HI>Norwich.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> obey'd
the Citation very readily, appear'd at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and retain'd one
Mr. <HI>Batchelour</HI> as his Proctor to manage his Defence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James</HI> finding him&s;elf &s;till defeated, and not venturing to
proceed in the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> let drop his Citation,

<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> has been inform'd, this black piece of Malice had its
birth in <HI>Je&s;us College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> concerted there between
Dr. <HI>Cook,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> and their Confederates; but
as he is not po&s;itive in that, he &s;hall be glad of an Occa&s;ion to ask
their Pardon for the Sugge&s;tion when they &s;hall have purg'd them|&s;elves
honourably from the Su&s;picion; and till then, thinks the
<PB N="11" REF="16">
Grounds he has for his Opinion are &s;ufficient to clear him of any
breach of Charity in believing it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was with his Family upon the Road from <HI>Wilney</HI> into
<HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> when this Publication was fir&s;t made; and coming
to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> on a Thank&s;giving-Day, he re&s;ted, and went to the Di&s;|&s;enting
Meeting to hear the Sermon; when, after Sermon, Mr.
<HI>Keeling</HI> the Mini&s;ter took him home to his Hou&s;e, and &s;hew'd him
the <HI>Gazette</HI> with the afore&s;aid Adverti&s;ement in it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> &s;urpriz'd at the Reading of this <HI>Gazette,</HI> as he well
might, immediately took Hor&s;e, leaving his Family in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and
re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where he expected to find out the
bottom of the matter.</P>
<P>In this place it will be nece&s;&s;ary to leave Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> a while, and
the Reader may &s;uppo&s;e him Travelling to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> with a Heart
full of Trouble to &s;ee him&s;elf per&s;ecuted with &s;o much Malice, and
in hopes to find out his Enemies and their De&s;ign. And while he
is on the Road, let us enquire upon what &s;orry and &s;andy Founda|tion
all this Fabrick of Malice and Folly was erected, which will at
la&s;t tend to le&s;&s;en the Wonder at the Authors being confounded in
their own Devices.</P>
<P>There had been a Man in <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl who&s;e Name was <HI>Gill</HI> (<HI>but,
to avoid all po&s;&s;ible Cavil, 'tis noted his Name was not</HI> ABRAHAM
GILL, <HI>but</HI> Stephen Clifford <HI>alias</HI> Gill. This Man having been
Committed for Forging Holy Orders, and Counterfeiting the
Coins, and Convicted of both, had broke out of the County Jayl
at <HI>Derby,</HI> and was fled from Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> having been inform'd of this
by his Attorney, immediately fixes it upon Mr. <HI>Gill, and he must
be the Man:</HI> And to bring this Plot to a Head, takes the pains, a|bout
<HI>June</HI> 1702, to &s;end to <HI>Derby,</HI> and informing the Jaylor there
that his Pri&s;oner was found, procures two Men to be &s;ent from <HI>Der|by</HI>
to &s;eize him, and &s;o &s;ure was he of his Game, that he openly gave
it out that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had broke out of Jayl, and he &s;hould be hang'd.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the two Men &s;ent by the Jaylor came over to
<HI>Wilney,</HI> and pretending extraordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> &s;ent
for him to an Ale-hou&s;e in <HI>Wilney.</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> went boldly, as inno|cently,
to them; and as they were Strangers, and had pretended
Bu&s;ine&s;s, he wonder'd they di&s;cours'd with him of &s;everal Things,
treated him courteou&s;ly, paid the Reckoning, but never &s;poke a
a word of any Bu&s;ine&s;s to him, only frequently whi&s;per'd toge|ther,
and left him.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17">
The Truth of this after came out, and Mr. <HI>Brookhou&s;e</HI> Jaylor
of <HI>Derby</HI> di&s;covered the whole Affair to Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> how and on what
Pretence the two Men were procur'd to be &s;ent from <HI>Derby,</HI> who&s;e
Bu&s;ine&s;s with him was <HI>to have apprehended him</HI>; but the rea&s;on of
their leaving him as they did, was, becau&s;e they found <HI>he was not
that Man.</HI></P>
<P>By this Di&s;covery Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> came to know that Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s A&s;|&s;i&s;tant
in this new Plot was one <HI>Thomas John&s;on</HI> an Attorney of <HI>Out|well,</HI>
a Man of ill Fame and foul Practice, who po&s;itively affirm'd
to the two Men that came from <HI>Derby,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was the &s;ame
Man that broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl.</P>
<P>This Delu&s;ion might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have pleaded in Excu&s;e of
Mr. <HI>James,</HI> if his next Scene had not put him out of the reach of
any rational Shelter or Defence; for, not content with this Defeat,
he joyn'd with this infamous Attorney and one <HI>Tho. Beart,</HI> who
&s;ince died in a mo&s;t horrible manner, rotting away above ground.
The&s;e three went to one <HI>John Marriot</HI> of <HI>Upwell,</HI> and offer'd to give
him 10 Pounds, or to Guineas, if he would &s;wear that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
was the &s;ame Man that had broke out of <HI>Derby</HI> Jayl for Forgery and
Counterfeiting.</P>
<P>But here they were defeated again, and Heaven, the only Pro|tector
of Innocence, &s;o blinded their Under&s;tanding, that they al|ways
made an ill Choice of their In&s;truments. Hone&s;t <HI>John Marriot</HI>
told them plainly, he knew Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was not the &s;ame Man; and
ask'd them with what face they could de&s;ire him to burthen his
Con&s;cience with a fal&s;e Oath, or fell his Soul for 10 Guinea's?</P>
<P>By this time the Reader is to &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI>
where having been above 14 Days, and all that while walk|ing
publickly about the Streets, and openly enquiring about the
Notice in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> he receiv'd a Me&s;&s;age from the Vice-Chan|cellour
of <HI>Cambridge</HI> to come to him to <HI>Je&s;us College</HI>; whither, con|firm'd
and a&s;&s;ur'd of his own Innocence, he freely went.</P>
<P>Coming to the College, Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> demanded his Name, which
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> readily told him, and the Place of his la&s;t Re&s;idence and
Preaching; <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Wilney.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> told him that he was de&s;crib'd
in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> and upon the Adverti&s;ement therein he mu&s;t &s;end
him to Jayl; which he accordingly did on the 24th of <HI>March</HI> to the
<HI>Tolhooth</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> by a <HI>Mittimus</HI> in the following Words, or
to that effect:<Q><PB N="13" REF="18"><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>Thus, without any Proof that he was the Man mention'd in the

Committed to Pri&s;on by the worthy Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>; of which 'tis pre|&s;um'd
he may hear again in a different manner than this.</P>
<P>Nor was the &s;ending him to Pri&s;on the End of their Malice, but
as &s;oon as he came thither he had heavy Irons laid upon him, and
was fetter'd like a Fellon or a Highway-man.</P>
<P>At the General Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being call'd, and Dr.
<HI>Cook</HI> &s;itting on the Bench, the Dr. told him, Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> they had
nothing to charge him with: He told them, Then they had done
him a great deal of Wrong to keep him in Cu&s;tody &s;o long, and
treat him &s;o hardly, and loading him with Irons: And as they had
now nothing again&s;t him, he hoped they never would; and there|fore
pray'd they would Di&s;charge him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, they remanded him to Pri&s;on. Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>
alledg'd he had a Letter from Mr. <HI>James,</HI> Rector of <HI>Upwell,</HI> full of
Crimes again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; in which Letter, it &s;eems, he de&s;ir'd
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> might be kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oner till the next Quarter Se&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>In
Obedience to this Command of Mr. <HI>James,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> endea|vour'd
to keep Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Pri&s;on: but the Barbarity of this
Treatment appearing &s;o exceeding great, and the Action &s;o foul
that the Country began to talk of it, &s;ome Gentlemen of the Country
having &s;poken of it to Dr. <HI>Cook</HI>'s Di&s;advantage, which coming to
his Ears, he was at la&s;t prevail'd upon to accept of Bail for Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI>
two eminent Freeholders of that Conuty of 80 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> each of|fering
to be his Bail.</P>
<P>The Bail being &s;uch as could not be objected again&s;t, <HI>The
Dr. let him go,</HI> binding his Bail in 60 <HI>l.</HI> each, and him&s;elf in 120 <HI>l.</HI>
to appear at the Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>This U&s;age of Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> with the Fury and Barbarity of their Cu|rate
and Rector, had &s;o wrought upon the Inhabitants of <HI>Upwell,</HI> to|gether
with the known Innocence of their Mini&s;ter, that it fill'd
them with ju&s;t Prejudices, and they unanimou&s;ly invited Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
to come and Preach to them as a Congregation Di&s;&s;enting from the
<PB N="14" REF="19">
Church; which he did, duly Licencing the Place in the Arch|deacon's
Court at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and duly Qualifying him&s;elf according
to Law.</P>
<P>From whence the Author of the&s;e Sheets humbly ob&s;erves, and
recommends it to the Con&s;ideration of the Clergy of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> Whether &s;uch unju&s;t and cruel Treatment of their
Fellow-Chri&s;tians, Neighbours and Brethren, is the Way to con|firm
the People in their Adherence to the Church of <HI>England</HI>; or
whether they do not rather Wound the Church, drive their Pa|ri&s;hioners
from her, fill them with Prejudices, and encrea&s;e the
Number of the Di&s;&s;enters in this Nation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being thus &s;ettled among his old People, and knowing
that he was to appear at the Quarter Se&s;&s;ions, where he had good
rea&s;on to expect all the foul U&s;age his Enemies wer capable
of, and where he &s;aw their Power was but too great, was advi&s;ed
to remove it by <HI>Certiorari</HI> to the <HI>Queens-bench</HI>; which he did
accordingly, the <HI>Certiorari</HI> being allow'd in Court, and the Fees

<P>But Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> the Curate hearing of this
<HI>Certiorari,</HI> they, or one of them, went to <HI>Cambridge</HI> at the A&s;|&s;ize;
and applying them&s;elves to my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> by
the means of Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> and Dr. <HI>James,</HI> they procur'd a <HI>Habeas Cor|pus</HI>
to remove Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to <HI>Norwich</HI> Jayl, pretending they could
prove Matter of Fact again&s;t him there.</P>
<P>Accordingly he was Committed to <HI>Norwich</HI> Jayl for Felony,
Forgery, Tre&s;pa&s;s, Contempt, and other high Crimes and Mi&s;de|meanours.</P>
<P>Here
the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> lay till the A&s;&s;izes; and &s;till his Ene|mies
being able to bring nothing again&s;t him, he mov'd, by his
Conncil, to be Di&s;charg'd, and was Di&s;charg'd accordingly, by
Order of the Court; which Order is there to be &s;een upon
Record.</P>
<P>Here he was credibly inform'd Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
&s;triving by &s;ome other Machinations and Con&s;piracies to have
continued Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Jayl to the next A&s;&s;izes, receiv'd a &s;evere
Reprimand from the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich</HI> for their unju&s;t and
inhumane Treatment of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; and that his Lord&s;hip threat|ned
them with Su&s;pen&s;ion upon that account.</P>
<P>Al&s;o that Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> the Regi&s;ter of the Spiritual Court at <HI>Nor|wich,</HI>
being enquir'd of concerning his Name being put into the
Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> as, that he would give a Reward
for the Apprehending Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; declared it was done without his
<PB N="15" REF="20">
Privity or Con&s;ent, and that it was a meer genuine Forgery; that
he knew nothing of it, but that it was as &s;trange and &s;urprizing to
find his Name there, as it could be to Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to &s;ee his there.</P>
<P>Thus being return'd to his People, Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
whom henceforward, in Charity to them, I &s;hall conceal under
the Title of the Con&s;pirators, theratned him, that if he pre&s;u|med
yet to Preach there, he &s;hould be &s;ent to Pri&s;on again:
But he continuing to do his Duty, it remains to examine how
punctual they were to their Words with him.</P>
<P>About the 13th of <HI>April</HI> 1704, one <HI>Thomas Pitchford,</HI> Con&s;table
of <HI>Wilney,</HI> &s;erv'd a Warrant on Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> under the Hand of <HI>Tho.
Edwards</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Ju&s;tice of the Peace for the <HI>I&s;le of Ely</HI>; the War|rant
requiring the &s;aid Con&s;table to bring Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> before him
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the 20th of the &s;ame Month at <HI>Wisbich.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;table having &s;erv'd his Warrant, took Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s
Word for his Appearing; but Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> one of the Con|&s;pirators,
came in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, and railing at the Con&s;table,
told him he mu&s;t keep Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> clo&s;e Pri&s;oner till his Appearnce,
for that then he &s;hould certainly go to Jayl; and if he went away
from him, he <HI>the Con&s;table</HI> &s;hould go to Jayl in his room, and more
ill Language to the like effect: however, the Con&s;table &s;till took
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Word for his Appearance.</P>
<P>On the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> being a Se&s;&s;ions, the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> ap|pear'd,
according to his Promi&s;e, at <HI>Wisbich,</HI> where was pre&s;ent

Con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> one of <HI>the Con&s;pirators,</HI> call'd the Con&s;table to bring
up <HI>Gill</HI> his Pri&s;oner: upon which Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> readily appear'd. The
<HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> immediately told their Tale, and giving Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> ba&s;e
and &s;currilous Language, according to their particular Talent,
which abounds that way, they inform'd the Ju&s;tices that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
bred great Di&s;turbances in the Pari&s;h by a Conventicle, as Con|venticles
did all <HI>England</HI> over. <HI>Which, by the way, might be the
only Truth they &s;poke:</HI> for it &s;eems by the&s;e very Words he bred no
more Di&s;turbance with his Conventicle than other Mini&s;ters did
with theirs; <HI>ergo,</HI> they &s;hould be all &s;erv'd &s;o. <HI>Shortest Way for
that.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> one of the Ju&s;tices, taking up the Cau&s;e, told
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> he was inform'd he kept an unlawful A&s;&s;embly or Conven|ticle
at <HI>Upwell,</HI> and gave him a great deal of rough and threat|ning
Language.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21">
Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> with Calmne&s;s and Re&s;pect replied, He own'd he kept
a Meeting for Religious Wor&s;hip at <HI>Upwell</HI> in the County of <HI>Nor|folk,</HI>
but, that it was no unlawful A&s;&s;embly; for the Place was
Licen&s;ed according to Law, and he had qualified him&s;elf as the
Law Directs: and therefore hoped he did not de&s;erve to receive
&s;uch Abu&s;e in that place.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice then Demanded to &s;ee the Licence by which the
&s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> held the Meeting; which he producing, both the
<HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> &s;aid in open Court it was Forged: and whether the
Court believed them or no, is uncertain, or what other rea&s;on
they had for it will be enquir'd in another place, but they imme|diately
made a <HI>Mittimus</HI> and Committed Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to the Jayl in
<HI>Wisbich</HI>&mdash;for Forging a Licence, and Preaching in a Conven|ticle.
And taking the Licence from him, they refus'd to re&s;tore
it him.</P>
<P>They demanded indeed Bail, but gave him no leave to find it,
refu&s;ing to let him &s;tir out of the place: But Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> may, with|out
Detriment to his Cau&s;e allow all their Preten&s;ions of Bail for
his Behaviour, &s;ince the Treatment he had received from them was
&s;uch, as he might be &s;ure whoever he had brought to be his
Bail &s;hould be brought into equal Trouble; and for that Rea&s;on
he re&s;olv'd to embroil none of his Friends.</P>
<P>And being &s;en&s;ible of no Crime for which he ought by the
Law to be bound to his Behaviour, he was advis'd not to of|fer
any Bail, and refer it to the Law &s;till to decide whether&mdash;it
could be ju&s;tly demanded.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom as well as Ju&s;tice of the&s;e Magi&s;trates is very re|markable
al&s;o here, that they &s;hould know no better than to
Commit a Man in the <HI>I&s;le of Ely</HI> for a Fact pretended to be com|mitted
in the County of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; all which will help to their
Con&s;olation when they &s;hall come to an&s;wer for it before a
Court and Judges that under&s;tand the Law.</P>
<P>And as I undertook at fir&s;t to prove every thing as I went along,
the following Affidavit is an undoubted Te&s;timony of the Truth
of this la&s;t part of the Tragedy; <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> charg|ing

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Cole</HI>'s Affidavit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JO&s;eph Cole</HI> of <HI>Upwell,</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> Gent,
maketh Oath, That <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> of <HI>Welney</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le of</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="22">
<HI>Ely</HI> and County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> is a Preacher to a Congre|gation
of her Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting Subjects in <HI>Up|well</HI>
afore&s;aid, having been a Preacher in the &s;aid Pari&s;h of
<HI>Welney</HI> for &s;everal Years last past, and that he is now, and
hath all the time, been well approved of his Congregation.
And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That on or about the 20th

and that at that time there was one Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI> Curate
to the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James</HI> in pre&s;ence; and
that the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> commanded the Con&s;table (who
then had the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> in Cu&s;tody) to bring up <HI>Gill</HI>
his Pri&s;oner, which the Con&s;table did; when and where Mr.
<HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> alledged, That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>
kept an unlawful Conventicle. And Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to ju&s;tifie the
keeping of a lawful Meeting for Wor&s;hip of <HI>God,</HI> produced his
Licence; whereupon the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
affirmed, That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> had forged the Licence, and
they gave the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> very ba&s;e, unbecoming, and &s;cur|rilous
Language, which Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> to my Knowledge, did not
de&s;erve, nor did it become them to utter; and afterwards,
upon this way of Complaint, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was committed to the
Jayt in <HI>Wisbich</HI> afore&s;aid. And this Deponent verily be|lieves,
That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have
maliciou&s;ly de&s;igned to ruin and undo the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and
his Family, con&s;i&s;ting of a Wife and four &s;mall Children;
for they have, by &s;everal barbarous ways of Pro&s;ecution, ut|terly
reduced the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and his Family to Pover|ty.
And this Deponent verily believes, that the &s;aid Mr.
<HI>Gill</HI> never gave either Mr. <HI>James</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> any
cau&s;e of Offence, nor did they, or ever could they, prove
any cau&s;e of their malicious Pro&s;ecution. But this Depo|nent
verily believes, that the cau&s;e of this Malice of Mr.
<HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> against Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> was becau&s;e
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> Preached twice every Lord's-day, and they but
once; and Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was more diligent in his Mini&s;try, and
more charitable to the Poor, and better approved of in his
Place than they the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI>
are. And this Deponent farther &s;aith, That Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> hath
been a Freeholder in the &s;aid Pari&s;h for &s;everal Years till
<PB N="18" REF="23">
about the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1702, and that <HI>James Holms</HI>

for &s;everal Years, a parcel of Land of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Freehold of

<P>In this Condition Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> remain'd a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner without Bail

<P>The&s;e Gentlemen, who now made up the number of the <HI>Con&s;pi|rators</HI>

<P>There were &s;everal Officers in the Town who wou'd have been

but the Country had rung too loud of the Injury done this

it in, the Judges being in Town, and the A&s;&s;izes begun, and ad|vis'd

<P>This whol&s;ome Advice (<HI>which they may have lei&s;ure to repent they
did not accept of</HI>) they over-rul'd: They flew into &s;ome Heat at
Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s arguing for him, and told him, tho' they were not
in their own Divi&s;ion, yet they were Ju&s;tices there as well as he,
and expected that they had a Power to act all over the I&s;le; and
if they had any Power they would try it, for <HI>the &s;aid</HI> Gill <HI>&s;hould

which Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> was over-ruled, and joyn'd with them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> told them, That be&s;ides his Profe&s;&s;ion, which he &s;up|pos'd
exempted him from &s;uch an In&s;ult as that, he had two
Qualifications expre&s;ly excepted in the Act, and which legally
forbid them what they now purpos'd to do&mdash;Fir&s;t, That he

<P>Ju&s;tice <HI>Bellamy</HI> urg'd again, That the&s;e were material Objections,

Land of Inheritance in the County of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> where he was
born, and a Freeman of the Corporation of <HI>Wigan.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> urg'd again, that he &s;hould be remanded to Pri&s;on
till they could &s;end to the Place to be inform'd&mdash;. But the Plot
was otherwi&s;e laid, and they re&s;olv'd he &s;hould go; &s;o they
call'd Captain <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> and order'd him to give him 20 S. which
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> refus'd: then they order'd his Name to be entred in a
Certificate for Impre&s;t Men, and the Ju&s;tices Sign'd it, and Deli|vered
him over to the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Fern</HI> in particular call'd to
the Souldiers, and bid them tear his Band off, and take him along
with them, and u&s;e him <HI>Severely,</HI> (<HI>in &s;o many Words.</HI>) Which
Command the Souldiers took care to execute; for they carried
him into a large Room crowded with Pre&s;t Men, where he had
nothing but Straw to lie on. And in this Po&s;ture and Place he
remain'd, &s;itting up in his Cloaths and Boots for &s;ix or &s;even days,

<P>To return to Mr. <HI>Gill.</HI> The Fateagne of this violent March re|duc'd
him to a very mi&s;erable Condition; his Feet and Legs gall'd
and &s;well'd with his Boots, and his Blood, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ur|feited
and heated with unu&s;ual Force beyond his Strength.</P>
<P>Thus you have the Hi&s;tory of his Delivery over to the Soldiers;
with whom, and in the Condition as above, he came to <HI>Cambridge</HI>;
where he was arre&s;ted for Debt, and &s;o by one Misfortune deli|vered
from another.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed &s;ome Attempts to clear him from this Arre&s;t; but
the Debt appearing to be real, and too much for them to di&s;charge,
being 27 <HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> they were forc'd to leave him in the <HI>Tollbooth</HI>
Pri&s;on at <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;pirators, who concluded their Work was done, and
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> carried clear off, were under no &s;mall Di&s;appointment
when they heard he was gotten out of their Hands: and tho' they
could not but know where he was, yet, in pur&s;uit of their old De|&s;ign,
they i&s;&s;ued Hue and Cry to apprehend him as a De&s;erter from
the Queen's Service, and Mr. <HI>Fern</HI> the <HI>Church-Ju&s;tice</HI> &s;ign'd the Hue
and Cry. This failing, they i&s;&s;ued a &s;pecial private Warrant to
Con&s;tables at <HI>Upwell, Wilney,</HI> and <HI>Maney,</HI> to make &s;earch for him,
and &s;till <HI>the reverend Mr.</HI> Fern'<HI>s Hand was to this al&s;o,</HI> as by the War|rant
now &s;ecured and remaining with the Con&s;tables of <HI>Wilney</HI> will
appear.</P>
<P>It was now high time for Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to take Sanctuary in the Law;
and going to Coun&s;el in the Ca&s;e, he was advi&s;ed to move in the
<HI>Queen's Bench</HI> for a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> to di&s;charge him from enrolling
or li&s;ting in the Army: which he did, and obtain'd it accord|ingly;
and al&s;o a Rule of Court for all the <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> to &s;how
Cau&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And now the&s;e Gentlemen having run their Length, the Tables
were turn'd, and the Time began to come when they mu&s;t render
an Acount to her Maje&s;ty and the Law for all this Oppre&s;&s;ion of her
Subjects, Contempt of her Authority, and Abu&s;e of the Power
put into their Hands by the Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29">
The <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> appear'd at the <HI>Queen's Bench</HI> Court in <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI>
and mov'd for Time, and &s;everal Motions being made alter|nately,
in order to bring in Affidavits; at la&s;t they found them&s;elves
&s;o pre&s;s'd by the Cour&s;e of the Law, that they were obliged to have
Recour&s;e to their old &s;tock of Villany they had work'd upon be|fore,
and form'd a &s;econd Con&s;piracy to bring Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> into Con|tempt
of the Court; the detecting whereof will conclude this part
of our Hi&s;tory: and the future Rewards Ju&s;tice will be&s;tow upon
them for the&s;e things, are re&s;erv'd to their proper Sea&s;on; and
may &s;erve for a Second Part of this Account.</P>
<P>After &s;even Weeks Impri&s;onment at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> having
made up matters with his Creditor was releas'd, and went home to
his Family at <HI>Welney,</HI> &s;howing him&s;elf publickly, and Preaching
every Week to his Congregation as u&s;ual; for now the <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI>
&s;aw he was out of their power, and whatever they did they mu&s;t
expect to account for.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they mov'd the Court that Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> might appear in Per|&s;on
to accu&s;e them, which was granted, and appointed to be on
the 4th of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Attorney &s;ent him Notice of this Order, and he immedi|ately
went for <HI>London</HI>; and &s;etting out on the 3d of <HI>July,</HI> in order
to his appearing in the Court, with one Mr. <HI>Tokelove</HI> in his Com|pany,
he was arre&s;ted on the Road about 6 Miles from his own
Hou&s;e, by one <HI>Betts</HI> a Bailiff, in an I&s;land Warrant, at the Suit of
one <HI>John Smith</HI> of <HI>Downham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Betts</HI> the Bailiff holding him to Bail, carry'd Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> to <HI>Maypole,</HI>
a little Village, 10 Miles from his own Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> being ex|ceedingly
&s;urpriz'd at this Arre&s;t, knowing the Con&s;equence of
his Di&s;appointment, per&s;waded the Bayliff to go back with him,
5 Miles to <HI>Maney,</HI> where he got &s;ome Friends to be his Bail.</P>
<P>This ended the Trifle of the Arre&s;t; but the <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> End
was an&s;wered by it; for by that time Bail was given it was After|noon,
and there was no po&s;&s;ibility of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s being in Court
at the time appointed, which was the next Morning, being not
able to ride all night, nor to ride &s;o hard as to reach to <HI>London</HI>
time enough, (&s;ending Mr. <HI>Tokelove,</HI> who was then with him, for|ward
to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to make Oath of what had pa&s;s'd, which he
did accordingly, as will appear by his Affidavit) being above 60
Miles, <HI>&s;o he went back to his own Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Court re&s;ented his Default, and the <HI>Con&s;pirators</HI> took Care
to have it improv'd to his Di&s;advantage: But before we come to
relate the Con&s;equences of the Contempt in Court, 'tis proper to
<PB N="25" REF="30">
examine the Contrivances of this Arre&s;t, and &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent Ma|nagement

<P>When <HI>Betts</HI> the Bayliff fir&s;t arre&s;ted Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> he told him, That
this was a Choak Pare for him, and was procur'd by Mr. <HI>Lateward,</HI>
<HI>one of the Con&s;pirators,</HI> to prevent his appearing at <HI>London.</HI></P>

&s;aith, That it is his Opinion that by in&s;inuating Speeches and

cau&s;ed the Clerk, one <HI>Thomas Fewlis</HI> (who is a loo&s;e, idle,

this Deponent farther &s;aith, That the &s;aid Mr. <HI>James</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> have given Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> very unju&s;t Pro&s;ecuti|on
which hath reduc'd him to Poverty, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> having been
impri&s;oned at their Complaint in &s;everal Goals, (<HI>viz.</HI>) at
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1702, and <HI>Aprill, May, June,</HI>

Pri&s;oner all the A&s;&s;ize Week, till di&s;charged the la&s;t Day ac|cording
to Law; and believes that he was entered in the
Goaler's Calender <HI>July</HI> 1703: And after their Threatning
to impri&s;on him again if he pre&s;umed to &s;erve and preach to
our Congregation any more, they have this la&s;t <HI>April</HI> per&s;ecu|ted
and impri&s;oned the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> and (without &s;hewing
Cau&s;e of the Impri&s;onment, or giving any Pro&s;ecution at
Se&s;&s;ions or A&s;&s;izes, which was at the &s;ame time of his Im|pri&s;onment
at <HI>Wisbech</HI>) they cau&s;ed him to be Impre&s;t out of
Goal for a Soldier, without Liberty to make any Defence,
when at the &s;ame time he was our Mini&s;ter, and well appro|ved
of, and highly beloved, having (as he may have &s;till) a
very plentiful Allowance for his Maintenance, that way of
Preaching (as this Deponent doth apprehend) being a lawful
Employment for a Maintenance; and his Congregation is
large, con&s;i&s;ting of Gentlemen, and very &s;ub&s;tantial Free|holders,
as well as Farmers: So that by the way of Pro&s;ecuti|on,
not only Mr. <HI>Gill,</HI> but al&s;o this Deponent, and all the

their Pro&s;ecution, yet it is a real Truth they have highly abu|&s;ed
both Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> and his Congregation, and con&s;tantly preach
railing Sermons, as this Deponent hath heard and believes;
and they are reputed very malitious and trouble&s;ome Men in

very infamous Reputation by the Accounts this Deponent has

two Wives or Women at the &s;ame time, and having Children
by them both; and of being a drunken and debauch'd Man:
and &s;aith, that He the &s;aid <HI>Gill,</HI> among&s;t others, was brought
before this Deponent, as a Per&s;on fit to be Impre&s;t into Her

Objection to the &s;aid <HI>Gill</HI>'s being Inli&s;ted according to the &s;aid

&s;aid <HI>Gill</HI> alledged that he had a Freehold at <HI>Wigan</HI> in <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire</HI>

He this Deponent believes he might de&s;ire

any account from <HI>Norwich</HI> that the &s;aid <HI>Gill</HI>'s Licence

and that the Articles of War were read, and the Li&s;ting mo|ney

<P>And 'tis fairly offer'd to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who we believe has been un|warily
drawn into this Snare, That if but any one of the above|&s;aid
Articles can be prov'd by him, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> will cea&s;e giving
him any Trouble on account of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on the bare Recommendation of any
Man, tho' never &s;o great, &s;hould allege &s;uch black Things as
the&s;e upon an innocent Man, and neither he nor his Authors
<PB N="47" REF="52">
be able to make out one Clau&s;e of it: from which we wi&s;h him
a good Deliverance, and leave that part to the I&s;&s;ue of the Law.</P>
<P>Indeed we have two hard-mouth'd Fellows that &s;wear heartily;
but the&s;e di&s;cover &s;o little Wit with their Good-will, that the
ea&s;ine&s;s of proving them Perjur'd will be as much a Scandal up|on
their Sen&s;es as their Hone&s;ty; we mean Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Fowlis</HI> Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Clark.</P>
<P>Wherefore we &s;hall begin with this &s;wearing Curate, who&s;e
Oath is, That Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> owns a Child by the Name of <HI>Abraham Gill</HI>
which is elder than a Child he had by his fir&s;t Wife.</P>
<P>No Man but Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> would ha' been caught in &s;uch a <HI>Fool-Trap,</HI>
and have &s;worn what is &s;o exceeding ea&s;ie to be detected, the
Children being to be produc'd, and their Ages prov'd.</P>
<P>Now 'tis plain and known to all the Neighbourhood, and a
thing in which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the Truth can be conceal'd, that Mr.
<HI>Gill</HI>'s fir&s;t Wife has been dead upwards of &s;even Years, and the el|de&s;t
Child he has by his pre&s;ent Wife is but five Years and half old,
or thereabout.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary Proof of this is omitted here, not that it is not the
mo&s;t ea&s;ie of all this Affair to make out, but becau&s;e it being to
come before a Court of Ju&s;tice as matter of Evidence, 'tis referr'd
to the genuine Proof of fact, and the I&s;&s;ue on a Tryal, when Mr.
<HI>Lateward</HI> will do well to produce this little <HI>Abraham in nubibus,</HI> and
prove his Age, and the Time of the Death of the fir&s;t Wife, and
Marriage of the &s;econd, and &s;ee how he can make the&s;e things out.</P>
<P>As to the Clerk's Affidavit, he has frequently own'd in Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s
hearing &s;ince, that he was drunk when he made it, and that he knew
not what was in it, and that if he had known there had been any
&s;uch thing in it, he would not have offer'd to ha' &s;worn it.</P>
<P>'Tis a mo&s;t unaccountable thing, that Mr. <HI>Lateward</HI> &s;hould &s;o far
expo&s;e him&s;elf in his Affidavit, when the Children are all alive,
born in the &s;ame Place, their Age regi&s;ter'd in the Pari&s;h-book,
and &s;o many living Witne&s;&s;es of the Time of their Birth; and
we blu&s;h for him to think, if he is not hardned beyond the ve|ry
Father of Lyes him&s;elf, what Confu&s;ion he mu&s;t be in, when he
&s;hall be ask'd to produce this Child of Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> that mu&s;t be above
nine Years old, or to name where it was Born, when Regi&s;tred,
or any Circum&s;tances of the matter.</P>
<P>So much is Malice frequently for&s;aken of its Sence, that the
ju&s;t regard Providence always &s;hews to Injur'd Innocence, is the
Safety of all hone&s;t Men, cau&s;ing the Subtilty of wicked fal&s;e Accu|&s;ers
to abandon them, and their Folly as well as Wickedne&s;s to go
<PB N="48" REF="53">
hand in hand, that Sin and Shame might come together, and their
fal&s;e Accu&s;ation carry its Detection in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Gentlemen have any farther Defence to make, any
more Affidavits to bring into Court, the Editor of this promi&s;es
them to give them their full and free place in the &s;econd part of this
Hi&s;tory; but humbly de&s;ires them, whether Clergy-men or Ma|gi&s;trates,
that, for the Honour and Dignity of their Offices and
Character, and the Ju&s;tification of their Under&s;tandings, that
they would either more nicely adhere to the Matter of Fact, or
more politickly conceal the vicious part, that they may not expo&s;e
them&s;elves, and force their humble Servants to detect them, to
avoid the Scandal of Blindne&s;s and Stupidity: that they would
leave Trifling, Circling, and going Round-about Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Cha|racter
with <HI>Suppo&s;es,</HI> we <HI>have Heard,</HI> and we <HI>are Inform'd,</HI> and
Says that <HI>he is inform'd,</HI> and the like; but, that they would rather
tell us plainly, and make it out, When he was Drunk, or Swore,
or Broke Jayl, or Forg'd Orders, or Liv'd Scandalou&s;ly; for
certainly, Gentlemen, the&s;e things ought to be made out, or el&s;e
to &s;ugge&s;t them is a mo&s;t barbarous Treatment, and a Slander that
redounds to the Infamy of the Contrivers.</P>
<P>AND now we come to pre&s;ent the World with the Account
Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> gives of him&s;elf, not from his own Mouth, but
from the Mouth of numerous Throngs of Neighbours, Inhabitants,
and Per&s;ons both knowing his Character and willing to do Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, to obviate the Scandal of his having Forg'd the Hand

<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Gentlemen, to go farther with our Adver&s;aries than
they can expect we &s;hould&mdash;what if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e for once
that this <HI>Abraham Gill</HI> was this immoral Man they &s;peak of, if he was
&s;uch a refin'd Cheat as to have Deluded all the <HI>Many, many honest
People</HI> who have Sworn to his Character, for who knows how far
the Wit and Subtilty of Man, under the Agency of a hardned
Mind, may furni&s;h a Man; and what Mi&s;ts the Devil may have
laid before the Eyes of Mankind, that this Man &s;hould be a Common
Drunkard and Swearer, and Cohabiter with two Women at once,
and a Congregation of &s;everal Hundreds of his Hearers where he
<PB N="57" REF="62">
liv'd all the time know nothing of it, nor his Enemies be able to
produce one Affidavit of any Man that ever &s;aw him Drunk, or
heard him Swear.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e &s;trange things come to pa&s;s, for the World
is full of &s;trange things, what can be Inferr'd from hence to ju|&s;tifie
the Treatment he has receiv'd, and all the Di&s;&s;enters through
his Intere&s;t?</P>
<P>But on this premis'd Suppo&s;ition I crave leave to draw a few Infe|rences,
which &s;hall &s;erve to the Clo&s;e of this Work.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Forgeries, all the Swearings, Drunkenne&s;&s;es, and
Lewdne&s;s they pretend to charge upon him, are antecedent to his
being a Di&s;&s;enter; and we do not find he receiv'd the lea&s;t Di&s;tur|bance
in the Execution of his Function on account of the&s;e known
Immoralities, and might to this day have kept his two Women
and his Cure of Souls both together, as too many of his Brethren
have done before him, and are like to do after him, for any great
Care we &s;ee taken to prevent it, had he but continued to read the
Common Prayer.</P>
<P>I forbear to di&s;cant upon this unhappy Truth; and of the many
known In&s;tances of an immoral Clergy, &s;hall repeat none, but ra|ther
cover the Infirmities of our Guides, that the Obligation, if
po&s;&s;ible, may move them both to reform, and to hide tho&s;e of
their Neighbours.</P>
<P N="2">2. Were all the Immoralities he is charg'd with True, they are
not comparable to tho&s;e committed in his Pro&s;ecution: the Perju|ries,
Subornations, Cruelties, Inju&s;tice, and illegal Proceedings,
are intolerable. This is Ca&s;ting out Devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince
of Devils: This is the Devil turn'd Reformer.</P>
<P N="3">3. What's all this to going for a Soldier? If every Clergy-man
mu&s;t be Li&s;ted that will be Drunk, if Swearing an Oath will pull a
Man's Band off and &s;end him to the Army, if every Clergy-man
that keeps a Woman more than he &s;hould do mu&s;t go into the Ar|my,
<HI>Lord have mercy</HI> and <HI>a Cro&s;s</HI> ought to be &s;et upon the Doors
of a great many Church-Tenements, and perhaps we need not
have &s;o many &s;evere Acts of Parliament for rai&s;ing Recruits.</P>
<P>Wherefore, upon the whole matter, we are not &s;o concern'd
to Vindicate Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Character, &s;ince were he all they could al|ledge,
it does not in the lea&s;t palliate or excu&s;e their Dealings with
him, nor will it be any Extenuation of their illegal Practices when
it comes to be Examin'd before a Court of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore enough: Let them rummage Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>'s Chara|cter
to the bottom, let them confute the many Affidavits we have
<PB N="58" REF="63" MS="y">
produced, per&s;wade the World to believe him an ill Man, a Drun|kard,
a Swearer, a Whorema&s;ter, or any thing, we humbly con|ceive
it is all again&s;t them &s;till; for they do not Per&s;ecute him as an
Immoral Man, if they had, why did they not do it long before?
for it mu&s;t have been known then: but they Per&s;ecute him as a Di&s;|&s;enter,
a Di&s;turber of the Neighbours with a Conventicle, Preach|ing
in <HI>Welney Chapel</HI> without Reading the Common Prayer: the&s;e
were the Crimes. All his Vices, if they were true, (<HI>which never|thele&s;s
we do not grant</HI>) were committed while he was <HI>Mr.</HI> Gill
<HI>the Curate,</HI> not &s;ince he was <HI>Mr.</HI> Gill <HI>the Di&s;&s;enter.</HI> He was <HI>Their
Mr.</HI> Gill when they &s;ay he kept an ill Woman: he is unaccus'd of
the lea&s;t Immorality &s;ince he was <HI>Our Mr.</HI> Gill. What will they
&s;ay to this part of it? This makes it a peculiar Pique at a Party, a
Pu&s;h made at the Di&s;&s;enters, a Sally of the Method call'd <HI>The &s;horte&s;t
way,</HI> &s;ending our Mini&s;ters <HI>a Colonelling,</HI> Voting them a &s;ort of Peo|ple
that do not live by a lawful Calling, and can give no good
Account of them&s;elves; and therefore, in the Eye of the Law,
are Vagabonds, and may all be Li&s;ted for Soldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We have therefore nothing more to &s;ay for Mr. <HI>Gill</HI>; we need
not undertake the Vindication of his Morals, we have the Inha|bitants
where he was Born, and Married his fir&s;t Wife; we have
the Inhabitants of <HI>Maney,</HI> and of <HI>Upwell</HI>; All the&s;e Sign to his Mo|rals,
and the People Swear that he is &s;uch a Man as they de&s;ire to
be their Mini&s;ter. If his Morals are bad, the Morals of the
People &s;hould be que&s;tion'd that de&s;ire a Common Drunkard and
Swearer to be their Mini&s;ter. We leave the re&s;t of the Ca&s;e
therefore upon them: if he is an ill Man, they will, no doubt,
make the Di&s;covery, and di&s;mi&s;s him, in Vindication of their own
Character; if not, but he continues to be their Mini&s;ter, and they
de&s;ire he &s;hould be &s;o, 'tis a better Te&s;timony of his Character than
&s;ome Hundreds of the Vicious Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can
produce, who&s;e Hearers and Pari&s;hioners would turn them out for
their Debaucheries, if they knew how: And of this I do not
de&s;ire to be forc'd to enter into the Particulars.</P>
