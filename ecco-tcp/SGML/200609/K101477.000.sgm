<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I ARRIVED at Paris, by a very rapid journey, the day before the Federa|tion; and when I am di&s;po&s;ed to mur|mur at the evils of my de&s;tiny, I &s;hall henceforth put this piece of good fortune into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, and reflect how many di&s;appointments it ought to coun|terbalance. Had the packet which con|veyed me from Brighton to Dieppe &s;ailed a few hours later; had the wind been con|trary; in &s;hort, had I not reached Paris at the moment I did reach it, I &s;hould
<PB N="2" REF="3">
have mi&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;pectacle which, perhaps, was ever repre&s;ented on the theatre of this earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;end you once a week the de|tails which I promi&s;ed when we parted, though I am well aware how very im|perfectly I &s;hall be able to de&s;cribe the images which pre&s;s upon my mind. It is much ea&s;ier to feel what is &s;ublime, than to paint it; and all I &s;hall be able to give you will be a faint &s;ketch, to which your own imagination mu&s;t add colour|ing and &s;pirit. The night before the Fe|deration, by way of prelude to the &s;olem|nities of that memorable day, the Te Deum was performed at the church of Notre Dame, by a greater number of mu&s;icians than have ever been a&s;&s;embled together, excepting at We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. The Overture which preceded the Te Deum was &s;imple and maje&s;tic; the mu&s;ic, highly expre&s;&s;ive, had the power of electrifying the hearers: and near the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
conclu&s;ion of the piece, the compo&s;er, by artful di&s;cords, produced a melancholy emotion; and then, by exciting ideas of trouble and inquietude, prepared the mind for a recitative which affected the audi|ence in a very powerful manner, by re|calling the images of that con&s;ternation and horror which prevailed in Paris on the 13th of July, 1789, the day before that on which the Ba&s;tille was taken. The words were, as well as I can recol|lect, what follows:&mdash;"People, your ene|mies advance, with ho&s;tile &s;entiments, with menacing looks! They come to bathe their hands in your blood! Already they encompa&s;s the walls of your city! Ri&s;e, ri&s;e from the inaction in which you are plunged, &s;eize your arms, and fly to the combat! God will combat with you!" The&s;e words were &s;ucceeded by a chorus of in&s;truments and voices, deep and &s;o|lemn, which &s;eemed to chill the &s;oul. But what completed the effect was, when the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;ound of a loud and heavy bell mixed it&s;elf with this awful concert, in imitation of the alarm-bell, which, the day before the taking of the Ba&s;tille, was rung in every church and convent in Paris; and which, it is &s;aid, produced a confu&s;ion of &s;ounds inexpre&s;&s;ibly horrible. At this moment the audience appeared to breathe with difficulty; every heart &s;eemed frozen with terror: till at length the bell cea&s;ed, the mu&s;ic changed its tone, and another re|citative announced the entire defeat of the enemy; and the whole terminated, after a flouri&s;h of drums and trumpets, with an hymn of thank&s;giving to the Su|preme Being.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed to &s;end you a de&s;cription of the Federation; but it is not to be de|&s;cribed! One mu&s;t have been pre&s;ent, to form any judgment of a &s;cene, the &s;ubli|mity of which depended much le&s;s on its external magnificence than on the effect it produced on the minds of the &s;pectators. "The people, &s;ure, the people were the &s;ight!" I may tell you of pavilions, of triumphal arches, of altars on which incen&s;e was burnt, of two hundred thou|&s;and men walking in proce&s;&s;ion; but how am I to give you an adequate idea of the behaviour of the &s;pectators? How am I to paint the impetuous feelings of that immen&s;e, that exulting multitude? Half a million of people a&s;&s;embled at a &s;pectacle, which furni&s;hed every image that
<PB N="6" REF="7">
can elevate the mind of man; which con|nected the enthu&s;ia&s;m of moral &s;entiment with the &s;olemn pomp of religious cere|monies; which addre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf at once to the imagination, the under&s;tanding, and the heart!</P>
<P>The Champ de Mars was formed into an immen&s;e amphitheatre; round which were erected forty rows of &s;eats, rai&s;ed one above another with earth, on which wooden forms were placed. Twenty days labour, amimated by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people, accompli&s;hed what &s;eemed to re|quire the toil of years. Already in the Champ de Mars the di&s;tinctions of rank were forgotten; and, in&s;pired by the &s;ame &s;pirit, the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t orders of citizens gloried in taking up the &s;pade, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the per&s;ons employed in a work on which the common welfare of the State depended. Ladies took the in|&s;truments of labour in their hands, and removed a little of the earth, that they
<PB N="7" REF="8">
might be able to boa&s;t that they al&s;o had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the preparations at the Champ de Mars; and a number of old &s;oldiers were &s;een voluntarily be&s;towing on their country the la&s;t remains of their &s;trength. A young Abb&eacute; of my acquaintance told me, that the people beat a drum at the door of the convent where he lived, and obliged the Superior to let all the Monks come out, and work in the Champ de Mars. The Superior with great reluc|tance acquie&s;ced: "Quant &agrave; moi," &s;aid the young Abb&eacute;, "je ne demandois pas mieux<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As for me, I de&s;ired nothing better.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>At the upper end of the amphitheatre a pavilion was built for the reception of the King, the Queen, their attendants, and the National A&s;&s;embly, covered with &s;triped tent-cloth of the national colours, and decorated with &s;treamers of the &s;ame beloved tints, and fleurs de lys. The
<PB N="8" REF="9">
white flag was di&s;played above the &s;pot where the King was &s;eated. In the mid|dle of the Champ de Mars <HI>l'Autel de la Patrie</HI> was placed, on which incen&s;e was burnt by prie&s;ts dre&s;&s;ed in long white robes, with &s;a&s;hes of national ribbon. Several in&s;criptions were written on the altar; but the words vi&s;ible at the greate&s;t di&s;tance were, "La Nation, la Loi, &amp; le Roi.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nation, the Law, and the King.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>At the lower end of the amphitheatre, oppo&s;ite to the pavilion, three triumphal arches were erected, adorned with em|blems and allegorical figures.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion marched to the Champ de Mars, through the central &s;treets of Paris. At La Place de Louis Quinze, the e&s;corts, who carried the colours, re|ceived under their banners, ranged in two lines, the National A&s;&s;embly, who came from the Tuilleries. When the proce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="9" REF="10">
pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treet where Henry the Fourth was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, every man pau&s;ed as if by general con&s;ent: the cries of joy were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;ucceeded by a &s;o|lemn &s;ilence. This tribute of regret, paid from the &s;udden impul&s;e of feeling at &s;uch a moment, was perhaps the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony to the virtues of that amiable Prince which his memory has yet received.</P>
<P>In the &s;treets, at the windows, and on the roofs of the hou&s;es, the people, tran&s;|ported with joy, &s;houted and wept as the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed. Old men were &s;een kneeling in the &s;treets, ble&s;&s;ing God that they had lived to witne&s;s that happy moment. The people ran to the doors of their hou&s;es, loaded with refre&s;hments, which they offered to the troops; and crowds of women &s;urrounded the &s;oldiers, and holding up their infants in their arms, and melting into tears, promi&s;ed to make their children imbibe, from their earlie&s;t

age, an inviolable attachment to the prin|ciples of the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion entered the Champ de Mars by a long road, which thou&s;ands of people had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming, by filling up deep hollows, levelling the ri&s;ing grounds, and erecting a temporary bridge acro&s;s the Seine, oppo&s;ite to the triumphal arches. The order of the proce&s;&s;ion was as follows:<LIST>

<P>The proce&s;&s;ion, which was formed with eight per&s;ons abrea&s;t, entered the Champ de Mars beneath the triumphal arches,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
with a di&s;charge of cannon. The de|puties placed them&s;elves round the in&s;ide of the amphitheatre. Between them and the &s;eats of the &s;pectators, the national guard of Paris were ranged; and the &s;eats round the amphitheatre were filled with four hundred thou&s;and people. The middle of the amphitheatre was crowded with an immen&s;e multitude of &s;oldiers. The National A&s;&s;embly walked towards the pavilion, where they placed them&s;elves with the King, the Queen, the Royal Fa|mily, and their attendants; and oppo&s;ite this group, ro&s;e in per&s;pective the hills of Pa&s;&s;y and Chaillot, covered with peo|ple. The &s;tandards, of which one was pre&s;ented to each department of the king|dom, as a mark of brotherhood, by the citizens of Paris, were carried to the altar, to be con&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop. High ma&s;s was performed, after which Mon&s;ieur de la Fayette, who had been appointed by the King Major-General of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the Federation, a&s;cended the altar, gave the &s;ignal, and him&s;elf took the national oath. In an in&s;tant every &s;word was drawn, and every arm lifted up. The King pronounced the oath, which the Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly re|peated, and the &s;olemn words were re|echoed by &s;ix hundred thou&s;and voices; while the Queen rai&s;ed the Dauphin in her arms, &s;hewing him to the people and the army. At the moment the con&s;ecrated banners were di&s;played, the &s;un, which had been ob&s;cured by frequent &s;howers in the cour&s;e of the morning, bur&s;t forth; while the people lifted their eyes to hea|ven, and called upon the Deity to look down and witne&s;s the &s;acred engagement into which they entered. A re&s;pectful &s;ilence was &s;ucceeded by the cries, the &s;houts, the acclamations of the multitude: they wept, they embraced each other, and then di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>You will not &s;u&s;pect that I was an in|different
<PB N="14" REF="15">
witne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;cene. Oh, no! this was not a time in which the di&s;tinc|tions of country were remembered. It was the triumph of human kind; it was man a&s;&s;erting the noble&s;t privilege of his nature; and it required but the common feelings of humanity, to become in that moment a citizen of the world. For my|&s;elf, I acknowledge that my heart caught with enthu&s;ia&s;m the general &s;ympathy; my eyes were filled with tears; and I &s;hall ne|ver forget the &s;en&s;ations of that day, <Q REND="inline">while memory holds her &s;eat in my bo&s;om.</Q></P>
<P>The weather proved very unfavourable during the morning of the Federation; but the minds of people were too much elevated by ideas of moral good, to at|tend to the phy&s;ical evils of the day. Se|veral heavy &s;howers were far from inter|rupting the general gaiety. The people, when drenched by the rain, called out, with exultation, rather than regret, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are wet for the nation.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Nous
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;ommes mouill&eacute;s &agrave; la nation.</Q> Some exclaimed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French revolution is cemented with water, in&s;tead of blood.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">La r&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e e&s;t ciment&eacute; avec de l'eau, au lieu de &s;ang.</Q> The national guard, during the hours which preceded the arrival of the proce&s;&s;ion, amu&s;ed the &s;pectators <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">With dancing in a circle.</NOTE><HI>d'une dance ronde,</HI> and with a thou&s;and whim|&s;ical and playful evolutions, highly expre&s;|&s;ive of that gaiety which di&s;tingui&s;hes the French character. I believe none but Frenchmen would have diverted them|&s;elves, and half a million of people, who were waiting in expectation of a &s;cene the mo&s;t &s;olemn upon record, by circles of ten thou&s;and men galloping <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the round dance.</NOTE><HI>en dance ronde.</HI> But if you are di&s;po&s;ed to think of this gaiety with the contempt of &s;upe|rior gravity, for I will not call it wi&s;dom, recollect that the&s;e dancers were the very men who&s;e bravery formed the great epo|cha of French liberty; the heroes who
<PB N="16" REF="17">
demoli&s;hed the towers of the Ba&s;tille, and who&s;e fame will de&s;cend to the late&s;t po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>Such was the admirable order with which this augu&s;t &s;pectacle was conducted, that no accident interrupted the uni|ver&s;al fe&s;tivity. All carriages were for|bidden during that day, and the entrances to the Champ de Mars were &s;o nume|rous, that half a million of people were collected together without a crowd.</P>
<P>The people had only one &s;ubject of re|gret; they murmured that the King had taken the national oath in the pavilion, in&s;tead of performing that ceremony at the foot of the altar; and &s;ome of them, crowding round Mon&s;. de la Fayette, con|jured him to per&s;uade the King to go to the altar, and take the oath a &s;econd time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My friends, the oath is not an air which can be played twice over.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Mes enfans,</Q> &s;aid Mon&s;. de la Fayette, <Q REND="inline">le &s;erment n'e&s;t pas une ariette, on ne peut pas le jouer deux fois.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
Mon&s;. de la Fayette, after the Federa|tion, went to the Ch&acirc;teau de la Muette, where a public dinner was prepared for the national guard. An immen&s;e crowd gathered round him when he alighted from his hor&s;e, at a little di&s;tance from the ch&acirc;teau; and &s;ome Ari&s;tocrates, mixing them&s;elves with the true wor&s;hippers of him who is &s;o ju&s;tly the idol of the French nation, attempted to &s;tifle him with their embraces. He called out, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But, my friends, you &s;tifle me.</NOTE><HI>Mais, mes amis, vous m'&eacute;touffez!</HI>" and one of his <HI>aides de camp,</HI> who perceived the danger of his general, threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e, which he entreated Mon&s;. de la Fayette to mount. He did &s;o, and ha&s;tened to the ch&acirc;teau.</P>
<P>This incident reminds me of a line in Racine's fine tragedy of Britannicus, where Nero &s;ays,

<P>THE rejoicings at Paris did not ter|minate with the ceremony of the Federa|tion. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of entertainments, which la&s;ted &s;everal days, were prepared for the deputies from the provinces, who were all quartered in the hou&s;es of the bourgeois, where they were received with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The night of the 14th of July the whole city of Paris was illuminated; and the next day <HI>le ci-devant Duc,</HI> now Mon&s;. d'Orleans, gave a public dinner to the national guard in the hall of the Palais Royal. We walked in the evening round the gallery, from which we &s;aw part of the crowd below amu&s;ing them&s;elves by dancing, while others were &s;inging in chorus the favourite national &s;ongs.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
On the following Sunday the national guards were reviewed by Mon&s;. de la Fayette in the Champ de Mars, which was again filled with &s;pectators, and the people appeared more enthu&s;ia&s;tic than ever in their applau&s;es of their general. The Champ de Mars re&s;ounded with re|peated cries of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live Mon&s;. de la Fayette.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Vive Mon&s;. de la Fayette!</Q> On this day carriages were again forbidden, and the evening di&s;played a &s;cene of general rejoicing. The whole city was illuminated, and crowds of com|pany filled the gardens of the Tuilleries, from which we &s;aw the beautiful <HI>fa&ccedil;ade</HI> of the Louvre lighted in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. In the Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es, where a f&ecirc;te was given to the Deputies, innu|merable lamps were hung from one row of trees to another, and &s;hed the mo&s;t agreeable brilliance on tho&s;e enchanting walks; where the exhilarated crowd danced
<PB N="20" REF="21">
and &s;ung, and filled the air with the &s;ound of rejoicing. Several parties of the na|tional guard came from the Champs Ely|&s;&eacute;es, dancing along the walks of the Tuil|leries with a woman between every two men; and all the prie&s;ts whom they met in their way, they obliged to join in the dance, treating them as women, by placing them between two &s;oldiers, and &s;ometimes &s;portively dre&s;&s;ing them in grenadiers caps. Fire-works of great variety and beauty were exhibited on the Pont Neuf; and the &s;tatue of Henry the Fourth was decorated with the ornament of all others the mo&s;t dear in the eyes of the people, a &s;carf of national ribbon. Tran&s;pa|rencies of Mon&s;. de la Fayette and Mon&s;. Bailly were placed, as the highe&s;t mark of public favour, on each &s;ide of this revered &s;tatue.</P>
<P>But the &s;pectacle of all others the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to my feelings, was the re|joicings at the Ba&s;tille. The ruins of that
<PB N="21" REF="22">
execrable fortre&s;s were &s;uddenly tran&s;|formed, as if with the wand of necro|mancy, into a &s;cene of beauty and of plea|&s;ure. The ground was covered with fre&s;h clods of gra&s;s, upon which young trees were placed in rows, and illuminated with a blaze of light. Here the minds of the people took a higher tone of exultation than in the other &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity. Their mutual congratulations, their reflections on the horror of the pa&s;t, their &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent felicity, their cries of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live the Nation.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Vive la Nation,</Q> &s;till ring in my ear! I too, though but a &s;ojourner in their land, re|joiced in their happine&s;s, joined the uni|ver&s;al voice, and repeated with all my heart and &s;oul, "Vive la nation!"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I &s;uffered my friends at Paris to conduct me through the u&s;ual routine of convents, churches, and palaces, I reque&s;ted to vi&s;it the Ba&s;tille; feeling a much &s;tronger de&s;ire to contemplate the ruins of that building than the mo&s;t per|fect edifices of Paris. When we got into the carriage, our French &s;ervant called to the coachman, with an air of triumph, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Ba&s;tille&mdash;but we &s;hall not remain there.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">A la Ba&s;tille&mdash;mais nous n'y re&s;te|rons pas.</Q> We drove under that porch which &s;o many wretches have entered never to repa&s;s, and, alighting from the carriage, de&s;cended with difficulty into the dungeons, which were too low to admit of our &s;tanding upright, and &s;o dark that we were obliged at noon-day to vi&s;it them with the light of a candle. We &s;aw the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
hooks of tho&s;e chains by which the pri|&s;oners were fa&s;tened round the neck, to the walls of their cells; many of which, being below the level of the water, are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of humidity; and a noxious vapour i&s;&s;ued from them, which more than once extingui&s;hed the candle, and was &s;o in&s;ufferable that it required a &s;trong &s;pirit of curio&s;ity to tempt one to enter. Good God!&mdash;and to the&s;e regions of horror were human creatures dragged at the caprice of de&s;potic power. What a melancholy con&s;ideration, that <Q><L>&mdash;Man! proud man,</L>
<L>Dre&s;t in a little brief authority,</L>
<L>Plays &s;uch fanta&s;tic tricks before high heaven,</L>
<L>As make the angels weep.</L></Q></P>
<P>There appears to be a greater number of the&s;e dungeons than one could have imagined the hard heart of tyranny it&s;elf would contrive; for, &s;ince the de&s;truction of the building, many &s;ubterraneous cells have been di&s;covered underneath a piece
<PB N="24" REF="25">
of ground which was inclo&s;ed within the walls of the Ba&s;tille, but which &s;eemed a bank of &s;olid earth before the horrid &s;e|crets of this pri&s;on-hou&s;e were di&s;clo&s;ed. Some &s;keletons were found in the&s;e re|ce&s;&s;es, with irons &s;till fa&s;tened on their de|caying bones.</P>
<P>After having vi&s;ited the Ba&s;tille, we may indeed by &s;urpri&s;ed, that a nation &s;o enlightened as the French, &s;ubmitted &s;o long to the oppre&s;&s;ions of their govern|ment; but we mu&s;t cea&s;e to wonder that their indignant &s;pirits at length &s;hook off the galling yoke.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have contemplated the dun|geons of the Ba&s;tille, without rejoicing in the French revolution, may, for aught I know, be very re&s;pectable per&s;ons, and very agreeable companions in the hours of pro&s;perity; but, if my heart were &s;ink|ing with angui&s;h, I &s;hould not fly to tho&s;e per&s;ons for con&s;olation. Sterne &s;ays, that a man is incapable of loving one woman

as he ought, who has not a &s;ort of an af|fection for the whole &s;ex; and as little &s;hould I look for particular &s;ympathy from tho&s;e who have no feelings of gene|ral philanthropy.

<P>The Ba&s;tille, which Henry the Fourth and his veteran troops a&s;&s;ailed in vain, the citizens of Paris had the glory of taking in a few hours. The avarice of Mon&s;. de Launay had tempted him to guard this fortre&s;s with only half the comple|ment of men ordered by Government; and a letter which he received the morn|ing of the 14th of July, commanding him to &s;u&s;tain the &s;iege till the evening, when &s;uccour would arrive, joined to his own treachery towards the a&s;&s;ailants, co&s;t him his life.</P>
<P>The courage of the be&s;iegers was in|flamed by the horrors of famine, there being at this time only twenty-four hours provi&s;ion of bread in Paris. For &s;ome days the people had a&s;&s;embled in crowds round the &s;hops of the bakers, who were obliged to have a guard of &s;oldiers to protect them from the fami&s;hed multi|tude;
<PB N="27" REF="28">
while the women, rendered furious by want, cried, in the re&s;olute tone of de|&s;pair, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t have bread for our children.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Il nous faut du pain pour nos enfans.</Q> Such was the &s;carcity of bread, that a French gentleman told me, that, the day preceding the taking of the Ba&s;|tille, he was invited to dine with a <HI>N&eacute;go|ciant</HI>; and, when he went, was informed that a &s;ervant had been out five hours in &s;earch of bread, and had at la&s;t been able to purcha&s;e only one loaf.</P>
<P>It was at this cri&s;is, it was to &s;ave them|&s;elves the &s;hocking &s;pectacle of their wives and infants peri&s;hing before their eyes, that the citizens of Paris flew to arms; and, impelled by &s;uch cau&s;es, fought with the daring intrepidity of men who had all that renders life of any value at &s;take, and who determined to die or conquer. The women too, far from in|dulging the fears incident to our feeble
<PB N="28" REF="29">
&s;ex, in defiance of the cannon of the Ba&s;tille, ventured to bring victuals to their &s;ons and hu&s;bands; and, with a &s;pirit wor|thy of Roman matrons, encouraged them to go on. Women mounted guard in the &s;treets, and, when any per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed, called out boldly, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who goes there?</NOTE>"Qui va l&agrave;?"</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had the command of fifty men in this enterpri&s;e, told me, that one of his &s;oldiers being killed by a cannon-ball, the people, with great marks of indignation, removed the corp&s;e, and then, &s;natching up the dead man's hat, begged money of the by-&s;tanders for his interment, in a manner characteri&s;tic enough of that gaiety which never for|&s;akes the French, even on &s;uch occa&s;ions as would make any other people on earth &s;erious. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madam, for this poor devil, who has been killed for the Nation!&mdash;Sir, for this unfortunate dog, who has been killed for the Nation!</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Madame, pour ce pauvre diable qui s'e&s;t fait tuer pour la Nation!

<P>When the Ba&s;tille was taken, and the old man, of whom you have, no doubt, heard, and who had been confined in a dungeon thirty-five years, was brought into day-light, which had not for &s;o long a &s;pace of time vi&s;ited his eyes, he &s;tag|gered, &s;hook his white beard, and cried faintly, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gentlemen, you have rendered me one great &s;ervice; render me another&mdash;kill me! for I know not where to go.&mdash;Come along, come along; the Nation will provide for you.</NOTE>"Me&s;&s;ieurs, vous m'avez rendu un grand &s;ervice, rendez-m'en un autre; tuez-moi! je ne &s;ais pas o&ugrave; aller."&mdash;"Al|lons, allons," the crowd an&s;wered with one voice, "la Nation te nourrira."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">
As the heroes of the Ba&s;tille pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets after its &s;urrender, the citizens &s;tood at the doors of their hou&s;es, loaded with wine, brandy, and other re|fre&s;hments, which they offered to the&s;e deliverers of their country; but they unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to ta&s;te any &s;trong liquors, con&s;idering the great work they had undertaken as not yet accompli&s;hed, and being determined to watch the whole night, in ca&s;e of any &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking the Ba&s;tille, were pre&s;ented, by the Munici|pality of Paris, with a ribbon of the na|tional colours; on which is &s;tamped, in|clo&s;ed in a circle of bra&s;s, an impre&s;&s;ion of the Ba&s;tille, and which is worn as a military order.</P>
<P>The Municipality of Paris al&s;o pro|po&s;ed a &s;olemn funeral proce&s;&s;ion, in me|mory of tho&s;e who lo&s;t their lives in this enterpri&s;e; but, on making application to the National A&s;&s;embly for a deputation
<PB N="31" REF="32">
of its members to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this &s;olemnity, the A&s;&s;embly were of opinion that the&s;e funeral honours &s;hould be po&s;tponed till a more favourable moment, as they might at pre&s;ent have a tendency to inflame the minds of the people.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal per&s;ons mention a young man, of a little in&s;ignificant figure, who, the day before the Ba&s;tille was taken, got up on a chair in the Palais Royal, and harangued the multitude, conjuring them to make a &s;truggle for their liberty, and a&s;&s;erting, that now the moment was ar|rived. They li&s;tened to his eloquence with the mo&s;t eager attention; and, when he had in&s;tructed as many as could hear him at one time, he reque&s;ted them to depart, and repeated his harangue to a new &s;et of auditors.</P>
<P>Among the dungeons of the Ba&s;tille are placed, upon a heap of &s;tones, the figures of the two men who contrived the plan of this fortre&s;s, where they were
<PB N="32" REF="33">
afterwards confined for life. The&s;e men are repre&s;ented chained to the wall, and are beheld without any emotion of &s;ym|pathy.</P>
<P>The per&s;on employed to remove the ruins of the Ba&s;tille, has framed of the &s;tones eighty-three complete models of this building, which, with a true pa|triotic &s;pirit, he has pre&s;ented to the eighty-three departments of the king|dom, by way of hint to his countrymen to take care of their liberties in future.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it to Ma|dame Sillery, who&s;e works on education are &s;o well known and &s;o ju&s;tly e&s;teemed in England, and who received me with the mo&s;t engaging politene&s;s. Surely the French are unrivalled in the arts of plea&s;ing; in the power of uniting with the mo&s;t poli&s;hed elegance of manners, that attentive kindne&s;s which &s;eems to flow warm from the heart, and which, while it &s;oothes our vanity, &s;ecures our affections. Madame Sillery and her pu|pils are at pre&s;ent at St. Leu, a beau|tiful &s;pot in the rich valley of Mont|morenci. Mon&s;. d'Orleans has cer|tainly conferred a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential obliga|tion upon his children, by placing them under the care of this lady. I never met
<PB N="34" REF="35">
with young people more amiable in their di&s;po&s;itions, or more charming in their manners, which are equally remote from arrogance, and from tho&s;e efforts of con|de&s;cen&s;ion which I have &s;een &s;ome great people make, with much difficulty to them&s;elves, and much offence to others. The Prince&s;s, who is thirteen years of age, has a countenance of the &s;weete&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, and appears to me to be Ade|laide, the heroine of Madame Sillery's Letters on Education, per&s;onified. The three Princes, though under Madame Sil|lery's &s;uperintendence, have al&s;o precep|tors who live in the hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in their education. The elde&s;t Prince, Mon&s;. de Chartres, is nearly eighteen years of age, and his attentive politene&s;s formed a &s;triking contra&s;t, in my mind, to the man|ners of tho&s;e fa&s;hionable gentlemen in a certain great metropolis, who con&s;ider apathy and negligence as the te&s;t of good|breeding. But if I was plea&s;ed with the
<PB N="35" REF="36">
manners of this young Prince, I was &s;till more delighted to find him a confirmed friend to the new con&s;titution of France, and willing, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young and ardent mind, to renounce the &s;plendor of his titles for the general good. When he heard that the &s;acrifice of fortune al&s;o was required, and that the immen&s;e property which he had been taught to con&s;ider as his inheritance, was to be divided with his brothers, he em|braced them with the utmo&s;t affection, declaring that he &s;hould rejoice in &s;uch a divi&s;ion. To find a democratic Prince, was &s;omewhat &s;ingular: I was much le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed that Madame Sillery had adopt|ed &s;entiments which are &s;o congenial to an enlarged and comprehen&s;ive mind. This lady I have called Sillery, becau&s;e it is the name by which &s;he is known in England; but, &s;ince the decree of the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, aboli&s;hing the nobility,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
&s;he has renounced with her title the name of Sillery, and has taken that of Brulart.</P>
<P>She talked to me of the di&s;tinctions of rank, in the &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, and ri|diculed the ab&s;urdity of converting the rewards of per&s;onal merit into the inhe|ritance of tho&s;e who had perhaps &s;o little claim to honours, that they were a &s;ort of oblique reproach on their character and conduct. There may be arguments again&s;t hereditary rank &s;ufficiently con|vincing to &s;uch an under&s;tanding as Ma|dame Brulart's: but I know &s;ome French ladies who entertain very different notions on this &s;ubject; who &s;ee no impropriety in the e&s;tabli&s;hments of nobility; and who have carried their love of ari&s;tocra|tical rights &s;o far as to keep their beds, in a fit of de&s;pondency, upon being obliged to relinqui&s;h the agreeable epithets of Comte&s;&s;e or Marqui&s;e, to which their ears had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
But let me do ju&s;tice to the ladies of France. The number of tho&s;e who have murmured at the lo&s;s of rank, bears a very &s;mall proportion to tho&s;e who have acted with a &s;pirit of di&s;tingui&s;hed patrioti&s;m; who, with tho&s;e generous affections which belong to the female heart, have gloried in &s;acrificing titles, fortune, and even the per&s;onal ornaments, &s;o dear to female va|nity, for the common cau&s;e. It was the ladies who gave the example of <HI>le don pa|triotique</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patriotic donation.</NOTE>, by offering their jewels at the &s;hrine of Liberty; and if the women of ancient Rome have gained the applau&s;e of di&s;tant ages for &s;uch actions, the wo|men of France will al&s;o claim the admi|ration of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The women have certainly had a con|&s;iderable &s;hare in the French revolution: for, whatever the imperious lords of the creation may fancy, the mo&s;t important
<PB N="38" REF="39">
events which take place in this world de|pend a little on our influence; and we often act in human affairs like tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;prings in mechani&s;m, by which, though invi&s;ible, great movements are regulated.</P>
<P>But let us return to Madame Brulart, who wears at her brea&s;t a medallion made of a &s;tone of the Ba&s;tille poli&s;hed. In the middle of the medallion, <HI>Libert&eacute;</HI> was written in diamonds; above was marked, in diamonds, the planet that &s;hone on the 14th of July; and below was &s;een the moon, of the &s;ize &s;he appeared that me|morable night. The medallion was &s;et in a branch of laurel, compo&s;ed of eme|ralds, and tied at the top with the national cockade, formed of brilliant &s;tones of the three national colours.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the Ba&s;tille, led Madame Brulart to relate an action of Mon&s;. de Chartres, which re|flects the highe&s;t honour on his humanity. Being in Normandy, he vi&s;ited Mont St.
<PB N="39" REF="40">
Michel, a fortre&s;s built on a rock which &s;tands a league and a half from the coa&s;t of Normandy. The tide covers this &s;pace twice every twenty-four hours; but when it is low water, a per&s;on can pa&s;s over on foot. Mont St. Michel was originally a church, founded by a good bi&s;hop in the &s;eventh century, in honour of St. Michel, who, it &s;eems, appeared to him in a vi&s;ion on this &s;pot. Richard, the fir&s;t Duke of Normandy of that name, afterwards con|verted the church into an abbey; and this abbey gave ri&s;e to the military order <HI>des Chevaliers de St. Michel,</HI> in&s;tituted by Louis the Eleventh. After having &s;een the precious relics of the abbey, the &s;quare buckler, and the &s;hort &s;word found in Ireland near the body of the well-known dragon, who&s;e de&s;truction is attributed to the prowe&s;s of St. Michel, Mon&s;. de Char|tres was conducted, through many laby|rinths, to the &s;ubterraneous parts of the edifice; where he was &s;hewn a wooden
<PB N="40" REF="41">
cage, which was made by order of Louis the Fourteenth, for the puni&s;hment of an unfortunate wit, who had dared to ridi|cule his conque&s;ts in Holland, no &s;ooner gained than lo&s;t Mon&s;. de Chartres beheld with horror this in&s;trument of tyranny, in which pri&s;oners were &s;till frequently confined; and, expre&s;&s;ing in very &s;trong terms his indignation, he was told, that, as a prince of the blood, he had a right, if he thought proper, to order the cage to be de&s;troyed. Scarcely were the words pronounced, when the young Prince &s;eized a hatchet, gave the fir&s;t &s;troke him&s;elf to this execrable ma|chine, waited to &s;ee it levelled with the ground, and thus may claim the glory of having, even before the demolition of the Ba&s;tille, begun the French revolution.</P>
<P>We found at St. Leu a young Engli&s;h lady, who is the companion of the Prin|ce&s;s, and who&s;e appearance is calculated to give the mo&s;t favourable idea of Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="41" REF="42">
beauty. I never &s;aw more regular features, or an expre&s;&s;ion of countenance more lovely: and Madame Brulart, by whom &s;he has been educated, a&s;&s;ured me that <Q REND="inline">the mind keeps the promi&s;e we had from the face.</Q> This young lady talked of her own country with a glow of &s;atisfaction very grateful to my feelings.

<P>I HAVE been at the National A&s;&s;embly, where, at a time when the deputies from the provinces engro&s;&s;ed every ticket of admi&s;&s;ion, my &s;i&s;ter and I were admitted without tickets, by the gentleman who had the commad of the guard, and placed in the be&s;t &s;eats, before he &s;uffered the doors to be opened to other people. We had no per&s;onal acquaintance with this gentleman, or any claim to his politene&s;s, except that of being foreigners and wo|men; but the&s;e are, of all claims, the mo&s;t powerful to the urbanity of French manners.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter ob&s;erved to me, that our &s;eats, which were immediately oppo&s;ite the tribune from which the members &s;peak, reminded her of our &s;truggles to attain the
<PB N="43" REF="44">
&s;ame &s;ituation in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall. But you mu&s;t recollect, I an&s;wered, that we have attained this &s;ituation without any &s;truggle. I believe, however, that if the fame of Mr. Fox's eloquence &s;hould lead a French woman to pre&s;ent her&s;elf at the door of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall without a ticket, &s;he might &s;tand there as long as Mr. Ha&s;tings's trial has la&s;ted, without being permitted to pa&s;s the barrier.</P>
<P>The hall of the National A&s;&s;embly is long and narrow; at each end there is a gallery, where the common people are admitted by applying very early in the morning for numbers, which are di&s;tri|buted at the door; and the per&s;ons who fir&s;t apply &s;ecure the fir&s;t numbers. The &s;eats being al&s;o numbered, all confu&s;ion and di&s;order are prevented. The galle|ries at the &s;ide of the hall are divided into boxes, which are called tribunes; they belong to the principal mem|bers of the National A&s;&s;embly; and to
<PB N="44" REF="45">
the&s;e places company are admitted with tickets. Rows of &s;eats are placed round the hall, rai&s;ed one above another, where the Members of the A&s;&s;embly are &s;eated; and immediately oppo&s;ite the chair of the Pre&s;ident, in the narrow part of the hall, is the tribune which the Members a&s;cend when they are going to &s;peak. One capital &s;ubject of debate in this A&s;|&s;embly is, who &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t; for all &s;eem more inclined to talk than to li&s;ten; and &s;ometimes the Pre&s;ident in vain rings a bell, or with the vehemence of French action &s;tretches out his arms, and endea|vours to impo&s;e &s;ilence; while the &s;ix Hui&s;&s;iers, per&s;ons who are appointed to keep order, make the attempt with as little &s;ucce&s;s as the Pre&s;ident him&s;elf. But one cea&s;es to wonder that the meetings of the National A&s;&s;embly are tumultuous, on reflecting how important are the ob|jects of its deliberations. Not only the lives and fortunes of individuals, but the
<PB N="45" REF="46">
exi&s;tence of the country is at &s;take: and of how little con&s;equence is this impe|tuo&s;ity in debate, if the decrees which are pa&s;&s;ed are wi&s;e and beneficial, and the new con&s;titution ari&s;es, like the beauty and order of nature, from the confu&s;ion of mingled elements! I heard &s;everal of the Members &s;peak; but I am &s;o little qualified to judge of oratory, that, with|out pre&s;uming to determine whether I had rea&s;on to be entertained or not, I &s;hall only tell you that I was &s;o.</P>
<P>And this, repeated I with exultation to my&s;elf, this is the National A&s;&s;embly of France! Tho&s;e men now before my eyes are the men who engro&s;s the attention, the a&s;toni&s;hment of Europe; for the i&s;&s;ue of who&s;e decrees &s;urrounding nations wait in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and who&s;e fame has already extended through every civilized region of the globe: the men who&s;e magnani|mity inve&s;ted them with power to de&s;troy the old con&s;titution, and who&s;e wi&s;dom is
<PB N="46" REF="47">
erecting the new, on a principle of per|fection which has hitherto been thought chimerical, and has only &s;erved to adorn the page of the philo&s;opher; but which they believe may be reduced to practice, and have therefore the courage to attempt. My mind, with a &s;en&s;ation of elevated plea&s;ure, pa&s;&s;ing through the interval of ages, anticipated the increa&s;ing renown of the&s;e legi&s;lators, and the period when, all the nations of Europe following the liberal &s;y&s;tem which France has adopted, the little crooked policy of the pre&s;ent times &s;hall give place to the reign of rea|&s;on, virtue, and &s;cience.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated characters in the National A&s;&s;embly were pointed out to us. Mon&s;ieur Barnave de Dauphine, who is only &s;ix and twenty years of age, and the younge&s;t member of the A&s;&s;em|bly, is e&s;teemed its fir&s;t orator, and is the leader of the democratic party. I believe Mon&s;. Barnave does not owe all his re|putation
<PB N="47" REF="48">
to his talents, however di&s;tin|gui&s;hed: his virtues al&s;o claim a con&s;i|derable &s;hare of that applau&s;e which he receives from his country. He has &s;hewn him&s;elf as &s;teadfa&s;t in principle, as he is eloquent in debate. With firm unde|viating integrity he has defended the cau&s;e of the people. Every motion he has made in the A&s;&s;embly has pa&s;&s;ed into a law, becau&s;e its beneficial tendency has been always evident; and it was he who effected that memorable decree which deprived the King of the right of making war, without the con&s;ent of the nation. Mon&s;. Barnave is adored by the people; who have two or three times taken the hor&s;es from his carriage, and drawn him in triumph along the &s;treets of Paris.</P>
<P>We al&s;o &s;aw Mon&s;. Mirabeau l'a&icirc;n&eacute;, who&s;e genius is of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, but who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very &s;mall &s;hare of popularity. I am, however, one of his parti&s;ans,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
though not merely from that enthu&s;ia&s;m which always comes acro&s;s my heart in favour of great intellectual abilities. Mon&s;. Mirabeau has another very power|ful claim on my partiality: he is the profe&s;&s;ed friend (and I mu&s;t and will love him for being &s;o) of the African race. He has propo&s;ed the abolition of the &s;lave|trade to the National A&s;&s;embly; and, though the A&s;&s;embly have delayed the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, on account of tho&s;e deliberations which immediately affect the country, yet, perhaps, if our &s;enators continue to doze over this affair as they have hitherto done, the French will have the glory of &s;etting us an ex|ample, which it will then be our humble employment to follow. But I tru&s;t the period will never come, when England will &s;ubmit to be taught by another na|tion the le&s;&s;on of humanity. I tru&s;t an Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons will never per&s;i&s;t in thinking, that what is morally
<PB N="49" REF="50">
wrong, can be politically right; that the virtue and the pro&s;perity of a people are things at variance with each other; and that a country which abounds with &s;o many &s;ources of wealth, cannot afford to clo&s;e one polluted channel, which is &s;tained with the blood of our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>But it is a &s;ort of trea&s;on to the honour, the &s;pirit, the genero&s;ity of Engli&s;hmen, to &s;uppo&s;e they will per&s;evere in &s;uch conduct. Admitting, however, a &s;uppo|&s;ition which it is painful to make; admit|ting that they &s;hould abide by this &s;y&s;tem of inhumanity, they will only retard, but will not finally prevent the abolition of &s;lavery. The Africans have not long to &s;uffer, nor their oppre&s;&s;ors to triumph. Europe is ha&s;tening towards a period too enlightened for the perpetuation of &s;uch mon&s;trous abu&s;es. The mi&s;ts of igno|rance and error are rolling fa&s;t away, and the benign beams of philo&s;ophy are &s;pread|ing their lu&s;tre over the nations.&mdash;But
<PB N="50" REF="51">
whither have the&s;e children of captivity led me? I perceive I have wandered a great way from the National A&s;&s;embly, where I was &s;o happily &s;eated, and of which I will tell you more in my next letter.</P>

<P>A &s;ingular but very re&s;pectable figure in the National A&s;&s;embly is a Deputy from Britany, called Le P&egrave;re Gerard.

The dre&s;s of Le P&egrave;re Gerard is made of a coar&s;e woollen cloth, which is worn by the pea&s;ants of Britany, and is of &s;uch &s;trong texture that a coat often de&s;cends from one generation to another.

While the National A&s;&s;embly were deliberating upon the divi&s;ion of property among brothers, a young man of high birth and fortune, who is a member of the A&s;&s;embly, entered with precipitation, and, mounting the tri|bune, with great emotion informed the A&s;&s;embly, that he had ju&s;t received ac|counts that his father was dying; that he him&s;elf was his elde&s;t &s;on, and had come to conjure the A&s;&s;embly to pa&s;s, without delay, that equitable decree, giving the younger &s;ons an equal &s;hare of fortune with the elde&s;t, in order, he &s;aid, that his father might have the &s;atisfaction, before

<P>YOU have not heard, perhaps, that on the day of the Federation at Paris, the national oath was taken throughout the whole kingdom, at the hour of twelve.</P>
<P>A great number of farmers and pea|&s;ants walked in the proce&s;&s;ion at Rouen, bearing in their hands the in&s;truments of their hu&s;bandry, decorated with national ribbons. The national guard cut down branches from the trees, and &s;tuck them in their hats; and a French gentleman of my acquaintance, who under&s;tands Eng|li&s;h, and reads Shake&s;peare, told me, that it &s;eemed like Birnham Wood coming to Dun&s;inane.</P>
<P>The leaders of the French revolution are men well acquainted with the human heart. They have not tru&s;ted merely to
<PB N="62" REF="63">
the force of rea&s;on, but have &s;tudied to intere&s;t in their cau&s;e the mo&s;t powerful pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, by the ap|pointment of &s;olemnities perfectly calcu|lated to awaken that general &s;ympathy which is caught from heart to heart with irre&s;i&s;tible energy, fills every eye with tears, and throbs in every bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I have heard of a proce&s;&s;ion, which took place not long ago in one of the di&s;tricts of Paris, in which five hundred young ladies walked dre&s;&s;ed in white, and deco|rated with cockades of the national rib|bon, leading by &s;ilken cords a number of pri&s;oners newly relea&s;ed from captivity; and who, with their faces covered by long flowing veils, were conducted to a church, where they returned thanks for their deli|verance.</P>
<P>Thus have the leaders of the revolution engaged beauty as one of their auxiliaries; ju&s;tly concluding, that, to the gallantry and &s;en&s;ibility of Frenchmen, no argu|ment
<PB N="63" REF="64">
would be found more efficacious than that of a pretty face.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t read a private letter from a little town about two leagues from Mont|auban, called Negre-Peli&s;&s;e, where the inhabitants, on the day of the Federation, di&s;played a liberality of &s;entiment which reflects honour, not only on them&s;elves, but on the age in which we live. The national guard of this little town and its environs, were a&s;&s;embled to take the na|tional oath. Half of the inhabitants be|ing Prote&s;tants, and the other half Ca|tholics, the Cur&eacute; and the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter a&s;cended together one altar, which had been erected by the citizens, and admini&s;tered the oath to their re&s;pec|tive pari&s;hioners at the &s;ame moment; after which, Catholics and Prote&s;tants joined in &s;inging Te Deum.</P>
<P>Surely religious wor&s;hip was never per|formed more truly in the &s;pirit of the Di|vine Author of Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e great

<P>This amiable community, when their devotions were fini&s;hed, walked in pro|ce&s;&s;ion to a &s;pot where fireworks had been prepared; and, it being con&s;idered as a mark of honour to light the fire|works, the office was re&s;erved for Mon&s;. le Cur&eacute;, who, however, in&s;i&s;ted on the participation of the Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter in this di&s;tinction; upon which the Mini&s;ter received a wax taper from the Cur&eacute;, and with him led the proce&s;&s;ion. The fire|works repre&s;ented two trees: one, twi&s;ted and di&s;torted, was emblematical of ari&s;|tocracy, and was &s;oon entirely con&s;umed; when a tall, &s;trait plant, figurative of pa|trioti&s;m, appeared to ri&s;e from the a&s;hes of the former, and continued to burn with undimini&s;hed &s;plendour.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY I received your letter; in which you accu&s;e me of de&s;cribing with too much enthu&s;ia&s;m the public rejoicings in France, and prophe&s;y that I &s;hall return to my own country a fierce republican. In an&s;wer to the&s;e accu&s;a|&s;ations, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that it is very difficult, with common &s;en&s;ibility, to avoid &s;ympathi&s;ing in general happine&s;s. My love of the French revolution is the natural re&s;ult of this &s;ympathy; and there|fore my political creed is entirely an af|fair of the heart; for I have not been &s;o ab&s;urd as to con&s;ult my head upon mat|ters of which it is &s;o incapable of judging. If I were at Rome, you would not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to hear that I had vi&s;ited, with the warme&s;t reverence, every &s;pot where any
<PB N="67" REF="68">
relics of her ancient grandeur could be traced; that I had flown to the capitol; that I had ki&s;&s;ed the earth on which the Roman &s;enate &s;at in council: And can you then expect me to have &s;een the Federa|tion at the Champ de Mars, and the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly of France, with indiffe|rence? Before you in&s;i&s;t that I ought to have done &s;o, point out to me, in the page of Roman hi&s;tory, a &s;pectacle more &s;olemn, more affecting, than the Champ de Mars exhibited; or more magnani|mous, more noble efforts in the cau&s;e of liberty than have been made by the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly. Whether the new form of government, e&s;tabli&s;hing in France, be more or le&s;s perfect than our own,
<Q><L>Who &s;hall decide, when doctors di&s;agree,</L>
<L>And &s;ounde&s;t ca&s;ui&s;ts doubt, like you and me?</L></Q>
I fancy we had better leave the determi|nation of this que&s;tion in the hands of po&s;terity. In the mean time, I wi&s;h that
<PB N="68" REF="69">
&s;ome of our political critics would &s;peak with le&s;s contempt, than they are apt to do, of the new con&s;titution of France, and no longer repeat after one another the trite remark, that the French have gone too far, becau&s;e they have gone farther than our&s;elves; as if it were not po&s;&s;ible that that degree of influence which is perfectly &s;afe in the hand of the executive part of our government, might be dange|rous, at this cri&s;is, to the liberty of France: but be this as it may, it appears evident that the temple of Freedom which they are erecting, even if imperfect in &s;ome of its proportions, mu&s;t be preferable to the old gloomy Gothic fabric which they have laid in ruins. And therefore, when I hear my good countrymen, who guard their own rights with &s;uch unremitting vigilance, and who would rather part with life than liberty, &s;peak with contempt of the French for having imbibed the noble le&s;&s;on which England has taught, I cannot
<PB N="69" REF="70">
but &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome mean jealou&s;y lurks beneath the ungenerous cen&s;ure. I can|not but &s;u&s;pect, that, while the fair and honourable traders of our commercial country act with the mo&s;t liberal &s;pirit in their ordinary dealings with other nations, they wi&s;h to make a monopoly of liberty, and are angry that France &s;hould claim a &s;hare of that precious property; by which, however, &s;he may &s;urely be en|riched, without our being impoveri&s;hed. The French, on the contrary, &s;eem to have imbibed, with the principles of li|berty, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of re&s;pect and friend&s;hip towards that people, whom they gratefully acknowledge to have been their ma&s;ters in this &s;cience. They are, to u&s;e their own phra&s;e, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Become madly fond of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE>"devenus fous des Anglois," and fondly imagine that the applau&s;e they have received from a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers in our country, is the general voice of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
Whether the new con&s;titution be com|po&s;ed of durable materials or not, I leave to politicans to determine; but it re|quires no extraordinary &s;agacity to pro|nounce, that the French will henceforth be free. The love of liberty has per|vaded all ranks of the people, who, if its ble&s;&s;ings mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed with blood, will not &s;hrink from paying the price:
<Q><L>While ev'n the pea&s;ant boa&s;ts his rights to &s;can,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate him&s;elf as man.</L></Q>
The enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of liberty di&s;plays it&s;elf, not merely on the days of &s;olemn ceremonies&mdash;occupies not only every &s;e|rious deliberation&mdash;but is mingled with the gaiety of &s;ocial enjoyment. When they conver&s;e, liberty is the theme of di&s;|cour&s;e; when they dance, the figure of the cotillon is adapted to a national tune; and, when they &s;ing, it is but to repeat a vow of fidelity to the con&s;titu|tion, at which all who are pre&s;ent in|&s;tantly
<PB N="71" REF="72">
join in chorus, and &s;portively lift up their hands in confirmation of this fa|vourite &s;entiment.</P>
<P>In every &s;treet, you &s;ee children per|forming the military exerci&s;e, and carry|ing banners made of paper of the na|tional colours, wearing grenadiers caps of the &s;ame compo&s;ition, and armed, though not like Jack the Giant-killer, with &s;words of &s;harpne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Liberty appears in France adorned with the fre&s;hne&s;s of youth, and is loved with the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion. In England &s;he is &s;een in her matron &s;tate, and, like other ladies at that period, is beheld with &s;ober veneration.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that, in my admiration of the revolution in France, I blend the feel|ings of private friend&s;hip with my &s;ym|pathy in public ble&s;&s;ings; &s;ince the old con&s;titution is connected in my mind with the image of a friend confined in the

gloomy rece&s;&s;es of a dungeon, and pining in hopele&s;s captivity; while, with the new con&s;titution, I unite the &s;oothing idea of his return to pro&s;perity, honours, and happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been driving at a furious rate, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, through the city of Paris, which, I think, bears the &s;ame re|&s;emblance to London (if you will allow me the indulgence of a &s;imile) that the grand natural objects in a rude and bar|ren country bear to the tame but regular beauties of a &s;cene rich with cultivation. The &s;treets of Paris are narrow, dark, and dirty; but we are repaid for this by noble edifices, which powerfully intere&s;t the at|tention. The &s;treets of London are broad, airy, light, and elegant; but I need not tell you that they lead &s;carcely to any edifices at which foreigners do not look with contempt. London has, therefore, mo&s;t of the beautiful, and Paris of the &s;ublime, according to Mr. Burke's defi|nition
<PB N="74" REF="75">
of the&s;e qualities; for, I a&s;&s;ure you, a &s;en&s;ation of terror is not wanting to the &s;ublimity of Paris, while the coachman drives through the &s;treets with the impe|tuo&s;ity of a Frenchman, and one expects every &s;tep the hor&s;es take to be fatal to the foot-pa&s;&s;engers, who are heard ex|claiming, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the &s;treets of Paris are ari&s;tocrates.</NOTE>"Que les rues de Paris &s;ont ari&s;tocrates."

told previou&s;ly, by a connoi&s;&s;eur in the&s;e matters, the preci&s;e degree of admiration which it was proper to be&s;tow on every public building in Paris; but, having re|ceived &s;uch minute in&s;tructions on this &s;ubject, I can form but an imperfect no|tion of my own ta&s;te for architecture.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of Madame Brulart, Mon&s;. de Chartres &s;ent orders for our ad|mi&s;&s;ion to the Palais Royal, which is not at pre&s;ent &s;hewn to the public. Of the collection of pictures I am incapable of &s;aying any thing, and enough has been already &s;aid by tho&s;e who under&s;tand its merits. Fine painting gives me con|&s;iderable plea&s;ure, but has not the power of calling forth my &s;en&s;ibility like fine poetry; and I am willing to believe that the art I love is the mo&s;t perfect of the two; and that it would have been impo&s;|&s;ible for the pencil of Raphael to convey all tho&s;e ideas to the mind, and excite all
<PB N="76" REF="77">
tho&s;e emotions in the heart, which are awakened by the pen of Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the only picture in Paris which has co&s;t me any tears, is that of La Val|liere, in the convent of the Carmelites. She is repre&s;ented in the habit of a Car|melite: all the former ornaments of her per&s;on lie &s;cattered at her feet; and her eyes are ca&s;t up to heaven, with a look of the deepe&s;t angui&s;h. While I gazed at her picture, I lamented that &s;en&s;ibility which led into the mo&s;t fatal errors a mind that &s;eems to have been formed for virtue, and which, even in the bo&s;om of plea&s;ure, bewailed its own weakne&s;s. How can one forbear regretting, that the capri|cious incon&s;tant monarch, to whom &s;he gave her heart, &s;hould have in&s;pired a pa&s;&s;ion of which he was &s;o unworthy; a pa&s;&s;ion which appears to have been wholly unmixed with intere&s;t, vanity, or ambition? And how can one avoid pity|ing
<PB N="77" REF="78">
the de&s;olate penitent, who, for &s;o many years, in the di&s;mal gloom of a convent, deplored her errors, and felt at once the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e, and the agony of di&s;appointed love? while, probably,
<Q><L>In every hymn &s;he &s;eem'd his voice to hear,</L>

<P>If the figure of this beautiful Carmelite had not come acro&s;s my imagination, I &s;hould have told you &s;ooner, that the Palais Royal is a &s;quare, of which the Due d'Orieans's palace forms one &s;ide. You walk under piazzas round this &s;quare, which is &s;urrounded with coffee-hou&s;es, and &s;hops di&s;playing a variety of ribbons, trinkets, and caricature prints, which are now as common at Paris as at London. The walks under the piazzas are crowded with people: and in the upper part of the &s;quare, tents are placed, where coffee, lemonade, ices, &amp;c. are &s;old. Nothing is heard but the voice of mirth; nothing is &s;een but cheerful faces; and I have no

doubt that the Palais Royal is, upon the whole, one of the merrie&s;t &s;cenes under the &s;un. Indeed, what is mo&s;t &s;triking to a &s;tranger at Paris, is that general ap|pearance of gaiety, which it is ea&s;y to perceive is not a&s;&s;umed for the moment, but is the habit of the mind, and which is, therefore, &s;o exhilarating to a &s;pectator of any benevolence. It is this which gives &s;uch a charm to every public place and walk in Paris. Ken&s;ington Gardens can boa&s;t as fine verdure, as maje&s;tic trees, as noble walks, and perhaps more beau|tiful women than the gardens of the Tuilleries; but we &s;hall look in vain for that &s;prightly animation, that everla&s;ting cheerfulne&s;s, which render the Tuilleries &s;o enchanting.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t returned from the H&ocirc;|pital des Invalides, a noble building, adorned with fine paintings which record the hi&s;tory of &s;ome celebrated &s;aints, who&s;e exploits were recounted with in|credible

rapidity by the man who con|ducted us through the chapels, and who &s;eemed to think that nothing could be more ab&s;urd than our curio&s;ity, after having heard the&s;e &s;tories from his lips, to ob&s;erve how they were told by the painters.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed through the church, we &s;aw &s;everal old &s;oldiers kneeling at the confe&s;&s;ionals, with that &s;olemn devotion which &s;eemed undi&s;turbed by our intru|&s;ion, and fixed upon "the things that are above."</P>
<P>A few days before the taking of the Ba&s;tille, a crowd of the Pari&s;ians a&s;&s;em|bled at the H&ocirc;pital des Invalides, and demanded arms of the old &s;oldiers; who an&s;wered that they were the friends of their fellow-citizens, but dur&s;t not deliver up their arms without the appearance of a conte&s;t; and therefore de&s;ired that the people would a&s;&s;emble before the gates in greater numbers the next day, when,
<PB N="80" REF="81">
after firing a little powder upon them, they would throw down their arms. The people accordingly returned the following day; and the invalids, after a faint &s;how of re&s;i&s;tance, threw down their arms, which the citizens took up, embraced the old men, and then departed.</P>
<P>We &s;topped ye&s;terday at La Mai&s;on de Ville, and went into a large apartment, where the mayor and corporation a&s;&s;em|ble. The walls are hung round with pic|tures of Kings and Dukes, which I looked at with much le&s;s re&s;pect than at the chair on which Mon&s;. Bailly &s;its. If his pic|ture &s;hould ever be placed in this apart|ment, I fancy that, in the e&s;timation of po&s;terity, it will obtain precedency over all the Princes in the collection.</P>
<P>As we came out of La Mai&s;on de Ville, we were &s;hewn, immediately op|po&s;ite, the far-famed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lamp-iron.</NOTE><HI>lanterne,</HI> at which, for want of a gallows, the fir&s;t victims

of popular fury were &s;acrificed. I own that the &s;ight of <HI>la lanterne</HI> chilled the blood within my veins. At that mo|ment, for the fir&s;t time, I lamented the revolution; and, forgetting the impru|dence, or the guilt, of tho&s;e unfortunate men, could only reffect with horror on the dreadful expiation they had made. I painted in my imagination the agonies of their families and friends; nor could I for a con&s;iderable time cha&s;e the&s;e gloomy images from my thoughts.</P>
<P>It is for ever to be regretted, that &s;o dark a &s;hade of ferocious revenge was thrown acro&s;s the glories of the revolu|tion. But, alas! where do the records of hi&s;tory point out a revolution un&s;tained by &s;ome actions of barbarity? When do the pa&s;&s;ions of human nature ri&s;e to that pitch which produces great events, with|out wandering into &s;ome irregularities?

<P>WE are ju&s;t returned from Ver&s;ailles, where I could not help fancying I &s;aw, in the back ground of that magnificent abode of a de&s;pot, the gloomy dungeons of the Ba&s;tille, which &s;till haunt my ima|gination, and prevented my being much dazzled by the &s;plendour of this &s;uperb palace.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewn the pa&s;&s;ages through which the Queen e&s;caped from her own apartment to the King's, on the memora|ble night when the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes</HI> vi&s;ited Ver|&s;ailles, and al&s;o the balcony at which &s;he &s;tood with the Dauphin in her arms, when, after having remained a few hours con|cealed in &s;ome &s;ecret rece&s;s of the pa|lace, it was thought proper to comply with the de&s;ire of the crowd, who re|peatedly
<PB N="84" REF="85">
demanded her pre&s;ence. I could not help moralizing a little, on being told that the apartment to which this bal|cony belongs, is the very room in which Louis the Fourteenth died; little &s;u&s;pect|ing what a &s;cene would, in the cour&s;e of a few years, be acted on that &s;pot.</P>
<P>All the bread which could be procured in the town of Ver&s;ailles, was di&s;tributed among the <HI>Poi&s;&s;ardes</HI>; who, with &s;avage ferocity, held up their mor&s;els of bread on their bloody pikes, towards the bal|cony where the Queen &s;tood, crying, in a tone of defiance, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We now have bread.</NOTE>"Nous avons du pain!"</P>
<P>During the whole of the journey from Ver&s;ailles to Paris, the Queen held the Dauphin in her arms, who had been pre|viou&s;ly taught to put his infant hands to|gether, and attempt to &s;often the enraged multitude by repeating, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spare mama!</NOTE>"Grace pour maman!"</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">
Mon&s;. de la Fayette prevented the whole Gardes du Corps from being ma&s;|&s;acred at Ver&s;ailles, by calling to the in|cen&s;ed people, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King begs of you to &s;pare his body-guards.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Le Roi vous demande grace pour &s;es Gardes du Corps.</Q> The voice of Mon&s;. de la Fayette was li&s;tened to, and obeyed.

Before the King came out of La Mai&s;on de Ville, Mon&s;. de la Fayette appeared, and told the multitude, who had pre&s;erved an in|dignant &s;ilence the whole way from Ver|&s;ailles to Paris, that the King had ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of the &s;tronge&s;t affec|tion for his people, and had accepted the national cockade; and that he (Mon&s;.

<P>While we were &s;itting, after dinner, at the inn at Ver&s;ailles, the door was &s;ud|denly opened, and a Franci&s;can friar en|tered the room. He had &s;o &s;trong a re|&s;emblance to Sterne's monk, that I am per&s;uaded he mu&s;t be a de&s;cendant of the &s;ame family.

<P>WE have been at all the Theatres, and I am charmed with the comic actors. The tragic performers afforded me much le&s;s plea&s;ure. Before we can admire Madame Ve&s;tris, the fir&s;t tragic actre&s;s of Paris, we mu&s;t have lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion (a thing impo&s;&s;ible) of Mrs. Siddons's performance; who, in&s;tead of "tearing a pa&s;&s;ion to rags," like Madame Ve&s;tris, only tears the hearts of the audience with &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the pieces we have &s;een at the French theatres have been little comedies relative to the circum&s;tances of the times, and, on that account, preferred, in this moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m, to all the wit of Moliere. The&s;e little pieces might per|haps read coldly enough in your &s;tudy,
<PB N="91" REF="92">
but have a mo&s;t charming effect with an accompaniment of applau&s;e from &s;ome hundreds of the national guards, the real actors in the &s;cenes repre&s;ented. Between the acts, national &s;ongs are played, in which the whole audience join in chorus. There is one air, in particular, which is &s;o univer&s;al a favourite, that it is called <Q REND="inline">le Carillon National:</Q> the burden of the &s;ong is, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will go on.</NOTE>"&Ccedil;A IRA."

"&Ccedil;A IRA" is every where the &s;ignal of plea&s;ure, the beloved &s;ound which ani|mates every bo&s;om with delight, and of which every ear is enamoured; and I have heard the mo&s;t &s;erious political con|ver&s;ations end by a &s;portive a&s;&s;urance, in allu&s;ion to this &s;ong, <HI>que</HI> "&Ccedil;A IRA!"</P>

la&s;t winter at London, I am told, &s;ome|times amu&s;ed him&s;elf at Paris, by getting up into one of the trees of the Palais Royal, after it was dark, and calling forth tones from his violin, fit to "take the pri&s;on'd &s;oul, and lap it in Ely&s;ium." He has frequently detained &s;ome thou&s;ands of people half the night in the Palais Royal, who, before they di&s;covered the performer, u&s;ed to call out in rapture, <Q REND="inline">Bravo, bravo! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is better than Giornowiche.</NOTE>c'e&s;t mieux que Gior|nowiche.</Q></P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from &s;eeing the Gobeiin tape&s;try, which appears the work of magic. It gave me plea&s;ure to &s;ee two pictures of Henry the Fourth. In one, he is placed at &s;upper with the mil|ler's family; and in the other, he is em|bracing Sully, who is brought forward on a couch, after having been wounded in battle. Nothing has afforded me more delight, &s;ince I came to France, than the
<PB N="93" REF="94">
honours which are paid to my favourite hero, Henry the Fourth, whom I prefer to all the Alexanders and Fredericks that ever exi&s;ted. They may be terribly &s;ublime, if you will, and have great claims to my admiration; but as for my love, all that portion of it which I be&s;tow on heroes, is already in Henry's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little &s;tatues of Henry the Fourth and Sully are very common. Sully is repre|&s;ented kneeling at the feet of this amiable Prince, who holds out his hand to him; and on the ba&s;e of the &s;tatue are written the words which Sully records in his Me|moirs: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But ri&s;e, pray ri&s;e, Sully; they will believe I am forgiving you.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Mais levez-vous, levez-vous donc, Sully; on croiroit que je vous pardonne.</Q></P>
<P>While the &s;tatue of Henry the Fourth, on the Pont-Neuf, is illuminated and de|corated with national ribbon, that of Louis
<PB N="94" REF="95">
the Fourteenth, in the Place Victoire, is &s;tripped of its former o&s;tentatious orna|ments; the nations which were repre|&s;ented enchained at his feet, having been removed &s;ince the revolution. The figure of Fame is, however, &s;till left hovering behind the &s;tatue of the King, with a crown of laurel in her hand, which, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;he is going to place upon his head. But I have heard of a French wit, who inquired whether it was really her intention to place the laurel on his Maje&s;ty's head, or whether &s;he had ju&s;t taken it off.</P>

<P>WE had a mo&s;t agreeable journey from Paris to Rouen, travelling a hundred miles along the borders of the Seine, through a beautiful country, richly wooded, and finely diver&s;ified by hill and valley. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal magnificent <HI>ch&acirc;teaux,</HI> and &s;aw many a &s;pire belonging to Gothic edifices, which, it would &s;eem, were built of &s;uch la&s;ting materials, with the moral purpo&s;e of leading the mind to reflect on the comparatively &s;hort dura|tion of human life. Frequently an old venerable cro&s;s, placed at the &s;ide of the road by the piety of remote ages, and never pa&s;&s;ed by Roman Catholics without &s;ome mark of re&s;pect, throws a kind of religious &s;anctity over the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>We &s;topped to look at the immen&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="98">
machine which conveys water to Ver&s;ailles and Marly. The water is rai&s;ed, by means of this machine, &s;ixty feet, and is carried the di&s;tance of five hundred. I never heard a &s;ound which filled my mind with more horror than the noi&s;e occa&s;ion|ed by the movements of this tremendous machine; while, at the &s;ame time, the va&s;t cha&s;ms, where the water foams with angry violence, make the brain giddy; and I was glad to leave the&s;e images of terror.</P>
<P>Part of our journey was performed by moon-light, which &s;lept mo&s;t &s;weetly upon the bank, and &s;pread over the land&s;cape tho&s;e &s;oftened graces which I will not at|tempt to de&s;cribe, le&s;t my pen &s;hould &s;tray into rhyme.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>chateau</HI> of Ro&s;ni, a noble domain given to Sully by Henry the Fourth; a te&s;timony of that friend|&s;hip which reflects equal honour on the King and the Mini&s;ter.</P>

On our way to Rouen we &s;lept at Gal|lon, a town about five leagues di&s;tant. Our inn was clo&s;e to the ca&s;tle, which formerly belonged to the Archbi&s;hop of Rouen, and which is now the property of the nation. The ca&s;tle is a venerable Gothic building, with a fine orangery, and parks which extend &s;everal leagues. The Archbi&s;hop, who is the Cardinal de la Rochefoucault, brother to that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed patriot the <HI>ci-devant</HI> Duc de la Rochefoucault, has lo&s;t a very con&s;idera|ble revenue &s;ince the revolution. He had an immen&s;e train of &s;ervants, whom it is &s;aid he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, upon the dimi|nution of his income, with all po&s;&s;ible gentlene&s;s, giving hor&s;es to one, a car|riage to another, and endeavouring to be&s;tow on all &s;ome little alleviation of the pain they felt at quitting &s;o good a ma&s;|ter.

<P>After vi&s;iting the ca&s;tle, I returned &s;omewhat in mournful mood to the inn, where there was nothing calculated to convey one cheerful idea.

<P>The cathedral is a very magnificent edifice; and the great bell is ten feet high, and weighs thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds. But, in France, it is not what is <HI>ancient,</HI> but what is <HI>modern,</HI> that mo&s;t powerfully engages attention. Nothing in this fine old cathedral intere&s;ted me &s;o much as
<PB N="105" REF="106">
the con&s;ecrated banner, which, &s;ince the Federation, has been placed over the altar, and on which is in&s;cribed, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let us live free, or die.</NOTE>Vivons libres, ou mourons!" I hope every French|man who enters the cathedral of Rouen, while he reads the in&s;cription on the con|&s;ecrated banner, repeats from the bottom of his &s;oul, "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> Let us live free, or die.</NOTE>Vivons libres, ou mourons!" But the French will, I tru&s;t, e&s;cape the horrors of civil war, notwith&s;tanding the gloomy forebodings of the enemies of the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A people ju&s;t delivered from the yok&eacute; of oppre&s;&s;ion, will &s;urely have little incli|nation to re&s;ume their &s;hackles; to re|build the dungeons they have &s;o lately de|moli&s;hed; to clo&s;e again tho&s;e gloomy mona&s;tic gates which are now thrown open; to exchange their new courts of judicature, founded on the ba&s;is of ju&s;tice and humanity, for the caprice of power, 
<PB N="106" REF="107">
and the dark iniquity of <HI>lettres-de-cachet</HI>; to quench the fair &s;tar of liberty, which has ari&s;en on their hemi&s;phere, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be once more guided by the meteor of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>A very con&s;iderable number, even among the Nobility of France, have had the virtue to &s;upport the cau&s;e of free|dom; and, forgetting the little con&s;idera|tions of vanity, which have &s;ome impor|tance in the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, but which are lo&s;t and annihilated when the mind is animated by any great &s;entiment, they have cho&s;en to become the benefactors rather than the oppre&s;&s;ors of their country; the citizens of a free State, in&s;tead of the &s;laves of a de&s;potic Monarch. They will no longer bear arms to gratify the ambition, or the ca|price of a Mini&s;ter; they will no longer exert that impetuous and gallant &s;pirit, for which they have ever been di&s;tingui&s;hed, in any cau&s;e unworthy of its efforts. The
<PB N="107" REF="108">
fire of valour, which they have too often employed for the purpo&s;es of de&s;truction, will henceforth be directed to more gene|rous ends. They will choo&s;e another path to renown. In&s;tead of attempting to take the citadel of glory by &s;torm, they will prefer the fame of an honourable defence, and, renouncing the &s;anguinary laurel, &s;trive, with more exalted enthu&s;ia&s;m, to obtain the civic wreath. Yes, the French nation will inviolably guard, will tran&s;mit to po&s;terity, the &s;acred rights of freedom. Future ages will celebrate, with grateful commemoration, the fourteenth of July; and &s;trangers, when they vi&s;it France, will ha&s;ten with impatience to the Champ de Mars, filled with that enthu&s;ia&s;m which is awakened by the view of a place where any great &s;cene has been acted. I think I hear them exclaim, "Here the Fede|ration was held! here an a&s;&s;embled na|tion devoted them&s;elves to freedom!" I fancy I &s;ee them pointing out the &s;pot on
<PB N="108" REF="109">
which the altar of the country &s;tood. I &s;ee them eagerly &s;earching for the place where they have heard it recorded, that the National A&s;&s;embly were &s;eated! I think of the&s;e things, and then repeat to my&s;elf with tran&s;port, "<HI>I</HI> was a &s;pectator of the Federation!"</P>
<P>But the&s;e meditations have led me to travel through the &s;pace of &s;o many cen|turies, that it is really difficult to get back again to the pre&s;ent times. Did you ex|pect that I &s;hould ever dip my pen in po|litics, who u&s;ed to take &s;o &s;mall an inte|re&s;t in public affairs, that I recollect a gentleman of my acquaintance &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, by informing me of the war between the Turks and the Ru&s;&s;ians, at a time when all the people of Europe, except my&s;elf, had been two years in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this intelligence?</P>
<P>If however my love of the French re|volution requires an apology, you &s;hall receive one in a very &s;hort time; for I

<P>Before I clo&s;e my letter, I &s;hall mention a &s;ingular privilege of the church of Rouen; which is, the power of &s;etting free a murdered every year on the day of A&s;cen&s;ion. It &s;eems that in the time of King Dagobert, who reigned in the &s;ixth century, a horrible and unrelenting dra|gon de&s;olated the country, &s;paring neither man nor bea&s;t. St. Romain, who was then bi&s;hop of Rouen, a&s;ked for two cri|minals to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in an enterpri&s;e he had the courage to meditate again&s;t the dragon; and with the&s;e <HI>aides-de-camp</HI> he &s;allied forth, killed the mon&s;ter, and deli|vered the country. In con&s;equence of this miracle, Dagobert gave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of St. Romain the privilege of &s;etting a murderer free every year on A&s;cen&s;ion|day.
<PB N="110" REF="111">
The bones of St. Romain are car|ried by the criminal in a gilt box through the &s;treets: the figure of a hideous ani|mal repre&s;enting the dragon, though it is &s;u&s;pected of &s;landering his countenance, accompanies the&s;e venerable bones, and has generally a young living wolf placed in its maw, except when it is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;t-day.</NOTE><HI>jour mai|gre,</HI> and then the dragon is provided with a large fi&s;h. The coun&s;ellors of the par|liament, dre&s;&s;ed in their &s;carlet robes, at|tend this proce&s;&s;ion to a church, where high ma&s;s is &s;aid; and, the&s;e ceremonies being performed, the criminal is &s;et at liberty; but it is only where there are &s;ome &s;trong alleviating circum&s;tances in the ca&s;e of the offender, that he is &s;uffered in this manner to evade the puni&s;hment of his crimes.</P>

<P>We have been at &s;everal convents at Rouen. The fir&s;t to which we went was a convent of Benedictine Nuns. When we had entered the gates we rang a bell, and a &s;ervant appeared, and de&s;ired us to go up &s;tairs to the parloir. We opened a wrong door, and found, in a room
<PB N="114" REF="115">
grated acro&s;s the middle with iron bars, a young man &s;itting on one &s;ide of the grate, and a young nun on the other. I could not help thinking that the heart of this young man was placed in a perilous &s;itua|tion; for where can a young woman appear &s;o intere&s;ting, as when &s;een within that gloomy barrier, which death alone can remove? What is there, in all the o&s;ten|tation of female dre&s;s, &s;o likely to af|fect a man of &s;en&s;ibility, as that di&s;mal habit which &s;eems &s;o much at variance with youth and beauty, and is worn as the melancholy &s;ymbol of an eternal renun|ciation of the world and all its plea&s;ures? We made an apology to the nun for our intru&s;ion; and &s;he directed us to another apartment, where, a few minutes after we had &s;eated our&s;elves on one &s;ide of the grate, La D&eacute;po&s;itaire entered on the other, and told us that the Abbe&s;s, whom we had de&s;ired to &s;ee, was not yet ri&s;en from dinner; and La D&eacute;po&s;itaire hoped

<P>From the convent of the Benedictines we went to that of the Carmelites, where religion, which was meant to be a &s;ource of happine&s;s in this world, as well as in the next, wears an a&s;pect of the mo&s;t gloomy horror. When we entered the convent, it &s;eemed the re&s;idence of &s;ilence and &s;olitude: no voice was heard, no hu|man creature appeared; and when we rang the bell, a per&s;on, whom we could not &s;ee, inquired, through a hole in the wall,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
what we wanted. On being informed that we wi&s;hed to &s;peak to the Sup&eacute;|rieure, putting her hand through the hole, &s;he gave us a key, and de&s;ired us to unlock the door of the parloir. This we accordingly did; and in a few minutes the Sup&eacute;rieure came to a thick double grate, with a curtain drawn at the in&s;ide, to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;een. Our French gentleman again talked of our de&s;ire to enter the convent, and beg|ged to know the rules. A hollow voice an&s;wered, that the Carmelites ro&s;e at four in the morning in &s;ummer, and five in the winter:&mdash;"Obedient &s;lumbers, that can wake and weep!"&mdash;That they &s;lept in their coffins, upon &s;traw, and every morning dug a &s;hovel-full of earth for their graves; that they walked to their devotional exerci&s;es upon their knees; that when any of their friends vi&s;ited them, if they &s;poke, they were not &s;uffered to be &s;een; or if they were &s;een, they were not

<P>As we returned home meditating on the lot of a Carmelite, we met in the &s;treet three nuns walking in the habit of their order. Upon inquiry, we were told that they had been forced by their parents to take the veil; and, &s;ince the decree of the National A&s;&s;embly giving them liberty, they had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pay a vi&s;it for three months to &s;ome friends who &s;ympathi&s;ed in their unhappine&s;s, and were now on their journey.</P>

<P>I EMBRACE the fir&s;t hours of lei&s;ure, which I have found &s;ince my arrival at the <HI>ch&acirc;teau,</HI> to &s;end you the hi&s;tory of my friends.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tin Francois Thomas du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, elde&s;t &s;on of the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, Coun|&s;ellor of the Parliament of Normandy, was born on the fifteenth of July, 1750. His early years were embittered by the &s;everity of his father, who was of a di&s;po|&s;ition that preferred the exerci&s;e of do|me&s;tic tyranny to the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial happine&s;s, and cho&s;e rather to be dreaded than beloved. The endearing name of father conveyed no tran&s;port to <HI>his</HI> heart, which, being wrapt up in &s;tern in&s;en&s;ibi|lity, was cold even to the common feel|ings of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">
The Baron's au&s;terity was not indeed confined to his &s;on, but extended to all his dependants. Formed by nature for the &s;upport of the ancient government of France, he maintained his ari&s;tocratic rights with unrelenting &s;everity, ruled his feudal tenures with a rod of iron, and con|&s;idered the lower order of people as a &s;et of beings who&s;e exi&s;tence was tolerated merely for the u&s;e of the nobility. The poor, he believed, were only born for &s;uffering; and he determined, as far as in him lay, not to deprive them of their natural inheritance. On the whole, if it were the great purpo&s;e of human life to be hated, perhaps no per&s;on ever attained that end more completely than the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</P>
<P>His &s;on di&s;covered early a ta&s;te for literature, and received an education &s;uit|able to his rank and fortune. As he ad|vanced in life, the treatment he experi|enced from his father became more and
<PB N="125" REF="126">
more intolerable to him, as, far from in|heriting the &s;ame character, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t feeling heart.</P>
<P>His mother, feeble alike in mind and body, &s;ubmitted with the helple&s;sne&s;s, and almo&s;t with the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a child, to the imperious will of her hu&s;band. Their family was increa&s;ed by two more &s;ons, and two daughters; but the&s;e chil|dren, being &s;everal years younger than Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, were not of an age to afford him the con&s;olations of friend&s;hip; and the young man would have found his &s;ituation intolerable, but for the &s;ym|pathy of a per&s;on in who&s;e &s;ociety every evil was forgotten.</P>
<P>This per&s;on, his attachment to whom has tinctured the colour of his life, was the younge&s;t of eight children, of a re|&s;pectable family of Bourgeois at Rouen. There is great rea&s;on to believe that her father was de&s;cended from the younger
<PB N="126" REF="127">
branch of a noble family of the &s;ame name, and bearing the &s;ame arms. But, unhappily, &s;ome links were wanting in this chain of honourable parentage. The claim to nobility could not be traced to the entire &s;atisfaction of the Baron; who, though he would have di&s;pen&s;ed with any moral qualities in favour of rank, con&s;i|dered ob&s;cure birth as a radical &s;tain, which could not be wiped off by all the virtues under Heaven. He looked upon marriage as merely a convention of inte|re&s;t, and children as a property, of which it was rea&s;onable for parents to make the mo&s;t in their power.</P>
<P>The father of M^l^l^e Monique C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was a farmer, and died three months be|fore the birth of this child; who, with &s;even other children, was educated with the utmo&s;t care by their mother, a wo|man of &s;en&s;e and virtue, beloved by all to whom &s;he was known. It &s;eemed as if this re&s;pectable woman had, after the
<PB N="127" REF="128">
death of her hu&s;band, only &s;upported life for the &s;ake of her infant family, from whom &s;he was &s;natched by death, the moment her maternal cares became no longer nece&s;&s;ary; her younge&s;t daughter, Monique, having, at this period, ju&s;t at|tained her twentieth year.

tho&s;e ambitious hopes of a great alliance which his father had fondly in|dulged, and to whom he owed at lea&s;t the reparation of ha&s;tening to implore his forgivene&s;s when he was willing to be&s;tow it.

<P>MONS. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> arrived at his fa|ther's <HI>ch&acirc;teau</HI> in Normandy, in June 1778, and was received by Mon&s;. le Baron, and all his family, with the mo&s;t affectionate cordiality. In much exulta|tion of mind, he di&s;patched a letter to Madame du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, containing this agree|able intelligence; but his letter was far from producing in her mind the effect he de&s;ired. A deep melancholy had &s;eized her thoughts, and her foreboding heart refu&s;ed to &s;ympathi&s;e in his joy. Short, indeed, was its duration. He had not been many days at the <HI>ch&acirc;teau,</HI> when he perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation, that his &s;teps were continually watched by two &s;ervants armed with fu&s;ees.</P>
<P>His father now &s;hewed him an <HI>arr&ecirc;t,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="148">
which, on the 4th of June, 1776, he had obtained from the Parliament of Rouen again&s;t his marriage. The Baron then or|dered his &s;on to accompany him to his hou&s;e at Rouen, whither they went, at|tended by &s;everal &s;ervants. That evening, when the attendants withdrew after &s;upper, the Baron, entirely throwing off the ma&s;k of civility and kindne&s;s, which he had worn in &s;uch oppo&s;ition to his nature, reproached his &s;on, in terms of the utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s, for his pa&s;t conduct, inveighed again&s;t his marriage, and, after having exhau&s;ted every expre&s;&s;ion of rage and re&s;entment, at length &s;uffered him to retire to his own apartment.</P>
<P>There the unhappy Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, ab&s;orbed in the mo&s;t gloomy reflexions, lamented in vain that fatal credulity which had led him to put him&s;elf into the power of his implacable father. At the hour of midnight his meditations were inter|rupted by the &s;ound of feet approaching
<PB N="148" REF="149">
his chamber; and in a few moments the door was thrown open, and his father, at|tended by a &s;ervant armed, and two <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Officers of ju&s;tice.</NOTE><HI>Ca|valiers de Mar&eacute;chau&s;&s;&eacute;e,</HI> entered the room. Re&s;i&s;tance and &s;upplication were alike unavailing. Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s papers were &s;eized; a few louis d'ors, which con|&s;tituted all the money he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were taken from him; and he was conducted in the dead of night, July the 17th, 1778, to St. Yon, a convent u&s;ed as a place of confinement near Rouen, where he was thrown into a dungeon.</P>
<P>A week after, his father entered the dungeon. You will perhaps conclude that his hard heart felt at length the relent|ings of a parent: you will at lea&s;t &s;up|po&s;e, that his imagination being haunted, and his con&s;cience tormented, with the image of a &s;on &s;tretched on the floor of this &s;ubterraneous cell, he could &s;up|port the idea no longer, and had ha&s;tened
<PB N="149" REF="150">
to give repo&s;e to his own mind by re|lea&s;ing his captive. Far different were the motives of his vi&s;it. He con&s;idered that &s;uch was his &s;on's attachment to his wife, that, &s;o long as he believed he had left her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;even hundred pounds, he would find comfort from that con&s;ideration, even in the depth of his dungeon. His father, therefore, ha&s;tened to remove an error from the mind of his &s;on, which left the mea&s;ure of his woes unfilled. Nor did he choo&s;e to yield to another the office of inflicting a pang &s;harper than captivity; but him&s;elf in|formed his &s;on, that the merchant who was to pay the &s;even hundred pounds to his wife, was declared a bankrupt.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> commenced a &s;uit at law again&s;t that agent of iniquity whom he had employed to deceive his &s;on, and who, practi&s;ing a refinement of treachery of which the Baron was not aware, had kept the &s;even

hundred pounds with which he was in|tru&s;ted, and given draughts upon a mer|chant who he knew would fail before the time of payment.

This was all &s;he heard of her hu&s;band for the &s;pace of two years. Ignorant of the place of his confinement, uncertain if he &s;till lived, perhaps her mi|&s;eries were even more poignant than his. In the di&s;mal &s;olitude of a pri&s;on, his pains were alleviated by the &s;oothing re|flexion that he &s;uffered for her he loved; while that very idea was to her the mo&s;t bitter aggravation of di&s;tre&s;s. Her days pa&s;&s;ed in angui&s;h, which can only be con|ceived where it has been felt; and her nights were di&s;turbed by the gloomy wan|derings of fancy.

The child was three years old when her father left England; recollected him perfectly; and, whenever her mother went to vi&s;it her, u&s;ed to call with eagerne&s;s for her papa.

<P>MONS. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was repeatedly of|fered his liberty, but upon conditions which he abhorred. He was required for ever to renounce his wife; who, while &s;he remained with her child in a di&s;tant country, was to receive from his father a &s;mall pen&s;ion, as an equivalent for the pangs of di&s;appointed affection, of di&s;|grace and di&s;honour. With the indigna|tion of offended virtue he &s;purned at the&s;e in&s;ulting propo&s;itions, and endea|voured to prepare his mind for the endu|rance of perpetual captivity.</P>
<P>Nor can imagination form an idea of a &s;cene more dreadful than his pri&s;on, where he perceived with horror that the great|e&s;t number of tho&s;e pri&s;oners, who had been many years in confinement, had an
<PB N="155" REF="156">
appearance of frenzy in their looks, which &s;hewed that rea&s;on had been too weak for the long &s;truggle with calamity, and had at la&s;t yielded to de&s;pair. In a cell ad|joining Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, was an old man who had been confined nearly forty years. His grey beard hung down to his wai&s;t; and, during the day, he was chained by his neck to the wall. He was never allowed to leave his cell, and never &s;poke; but Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> u&s;ed to hear the rattling of his chains.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners, a few excepted, were generally brought from their cells at the hour of noon, and dined together. But this gloomy repa&s;t was &s;erved in uninterrupted &s;ilence. They were not &s;uffered to utter one word; and the pe|nalty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this rule, was a rigo|rous confinement of &s;everal weeks. As &s;oon as this comfortle&s;s meal was fini&s;hed, the pri&s;oners were in&s;tantly obliged to return to their dungeons, in which they
<PB N="156" REF="157">
were locked up till the &s;ame hour the following day. Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, in his damp and melancholy cell, pa&s;&s;ed two winters without fire, and &s;uffered &s;o &s;e|verely from cold, that he was obliged to wrap him&s;elf up in the &s;ew clothes which covered his bed. Nor was he allowed any light, except that which during the &s;hort day beamed through the &s;mall grated window in the cieling of his dun|geon.</P>
<P>Is it not difficult to believe that the&s;e &s;ufferings were inflicted by a father? A father!&mdash;that name which I can|not trace without emotion; which con|veys all the ideas of protection, of &s;e|curity, of tenderne&s;s; that dear rela|tion to which, in general, children owe their profperity, their enjoyments, and even their virtues!&mdash;Alas, the unhappy Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> owed nothing to <HI>his</HI> father, but that life, which from its earlie&s;t period his cruelty had embittered, and
<PB N="157" REF="158">
which he now condemned to langui&s;h in mi&s;eries that death only could heal.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, who was confined in a cell on one &s;ide of Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s, contrived to make a &s;mall hole through the wall; and the&s;e companions in mi&s;|fortune, by placing them&s;elves clo&s;e to the hole, could conver&s;e together in whi&s;pers. But the Monks were not long in di&s;cover|ing this, and effectually deprived them of &s;o great an indulgence, by removing them to di&s;tant cells. The&s;e unrelenting Monks, who performed with &s;uch fidelity their office of tormenting their fellow-crea|tures, who never relaxed in one article of per&s;ecution, and adhered with &s;crupulous rigour to the code of cruelty, were called <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Brothers of the Holy Charity.</NOTE>"Les Fr&egrave;res de la &s;ainte Charit&eacute;." One among them de&s;erved the appellation. This good old Monk u&s;ed to vi&s;it the pri|&s;oners by &s;tealth, and endeavour to ad|mini&s;ter

comfort to their affliction. Often he repeated to Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My dear brother, be comforted; place your confidence in God; your afflictions will have an end.</NOTE><Q REND="inline">Mon cher fr&egrave;re, con&s;olez-vous; mettez votre confiance en Dieu; vos maux &s;eront finis!</Q></P>
<P>Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> remained two years in pri&s;on without receiving any intelli|gence of his wife, on who&s;e account he &s;uffered the mo&s;t di&s;tracting anxiety.

<P>YOU, my dear friend, who have felt the tender attachments of love and friend|&s;hip, and the painful anxieties which ab|&s;ence occa&s;ions, even amid&s;t &s;cenes of variety and plea&s;ure; who under&s;tand the value at which tidings from tho&s;e we love is computed in the arithmetic of the heart; who have heard with almo&s;t un|controulable emotion the po&s;tman's rap at the door; have trembling &s;een the well-known hand which excited &s;en&s;a|tions that almo&s;t deprived you of power to break the &s;eal which &s;eemed the tali&s;|man of happine&s;s; you can judge of the feelings of Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> when he received, by means of the &s;ame friend who had conveyed his letter, an an&s;wer from his wife. But the per&s;on who
<PB N="164" REF="165">
brought the letter to his dungeon, dread|ing the ri&s;k of a di&s;covery, in&s;i&s;ted, that, after having read it, he &s;hould return it to him immediately. Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> pre&s;&s;ed the letter to his heart, bathed it with his tears, and implored the indul|gence of keeping it at lea&s;t till the next morning. He was allowed to do &s;o, and read it till every word was imprinted on his memory; and, after enjoying the &s;ad luxury of holding it that night on his bo&s;om, was forced the next morning to relinqui&s;h his trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October, 1780, the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> came to the convent, and ordered the Monks to bring his &s;on from his dungeon to the parloir, and leave them together. With the utmo&s;t reluctance Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> obeyed this &s;ummons, having long lo&s;t all hope of &s;oftening the obdurate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of his father. When the Monks withdrew the Baron began upbraiding him in the mo&s;t bitter
<PB N="165" REF="166">
terms, for his ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to his will, which, he informed him, had availed nothing, as he had gained his &s;uit at law, and recovered the &s;even hundred pounds. Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> replied, that the pain he felt from this intelligence would have been for more acute, had his wife been deprived, with his concurrence, of the money which was promi&s;ed for her &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and on the reliance of which pro|mi&s;e he had been tempted to leave Eng|land. His father then inquired if he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his adherence to the di&s;grace|ful connexion he had formed; to which his &s;on an&s;wered, that not merely were his affections intere&s;ted, but that his honour obliged him to maintain, with inviolable fidelity, a &s;olemn and &s;acred engagment. The rage of the Baron, at the&s;e words, became unbounded: he &s;tamped the ground with his feet; he aimed a &s;troke at his &s;on, who, taking advantage of this moment of frenzy, determined to
<PB N="166" REF="167">
attempt his e&s;cape; and, ru&s;hing out of the apartment, and avoiding that &s;ide of the convent which the Monks inhabited, he endeavoured to find his way to the garden, but mi&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age which led to it. He then flew up a &s;tair-ca&s;e, from which he heard the voice of his fa|ther calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Finding that all the doors which he pa&s;&s;ed were &s;hut, he continued a&s;cending till he reached the top of the building, where, meeting with no other opening than a hole made in the &s;loping roof to let in light to a garret, he climbed up with much diffi|culty, and then putting his feet through the hole, and letting his body out by de|grees, he &s;upported him&s;elf for a moment on the roof, and deliberated on what he was about to do. But his mind was, at this cri&s;is, wrought up to a pitch of de|&s;peration, which mocked the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear. He quitted his hold, and, fling|ing him&s;elf from a height of nearly fifty
<PB N="167" REF="168">
feet, became in&s;en&s;ible before he reached the ground, where he lay weltering in his blood, and to all appearance dead.</P>
<P>He had fallen on the high road lead|ing from Rouen to Caen. Some people who were pa&s;&s;ing gathered round him; and one per&s;on having wa&s;hed the blood from his face, in&s;tantly recognized his features, and exclaimed to the a&s;toni&s;hed crowd, that he was the elde&s;t &s;on of the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. Upon examining his body, it was found that he had broken his arm, his thigh, his ancle-bone, and his heel, be&s;ides having received many vio|lent brui&s;es. He &s;till remained in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; and, while the&s;e charita|ble &s;trangers were u&s;ing their efforts to re&s;tore him to life, the Monks ha&s;tened from their convent, &s;natched their victim from tho&s;e good Samaritans who would have poured oil and wine into his wounds, and carried him to the infirmary of the convent, where he remained &s;ome weeks
<PB N="168" REF="169">
before he recovered his &s;en&s;es; after which he lay &s;tretched upon a bed for three months, &s;uffering agonies of pain.</P>
<P>His father, who had been the jailor, and almo&s;t the murderer of his &s;on, heard of the&s;e &s;ufferings without remor&s;e, nor did he ever &s;ee him more. But, though he was &s;ufficiently obdurate to bear un|moved the calamities he had inflicted on his child, though he could check the up|braidings of his own con&s;cience, he could not &s;ilence the voice of public indigna|tion. The report that Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> had been found lying on the road bathed in blood, and had in that condition been dragged to the pri&s;on of St. Yon, was &s;oon &s;pread through the town of Rouen. Every one &s;ympathi&s;ed in the fate of this unfortunate young man, and execrated the tyranny of his unrelenting father.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al clamour reached the ear of his brother, Mon&s;. de B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who now, for the fir&s;t time, out of re&s;pect to
<PB N="169" REF="170">
the public opinion, took a mea&s;ure which his heart had never dictated during the long captivity of his brother, that of vi|&s;iting him in pri&s;on. Mon&s;. de B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s de&s;ign in the&s;e vi&s;its was merely to appea&s;e the public; for &s;mall indeed was the con|&s;olation they afforded to his brother. He did not come to bathe with his tears the bed where that unhappy young man lay &s;tretched in pain and angui&s;h; to lament the &s;everity of his father; to offer him all the con&s;olation of fraternal tender|ne&s;s:&mdash;he came to warn him again&s;t in|dulging a hope of ever regaining his li|berty&mdash;he came to pierce his &s;oul with <Q REND="inline">hard unkindne&s;s' alter'd eye, which mocks the tear it forc'd to flow.</Q></P>
<P>I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the wretchedne&s;s of Madame du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, when &s;he heard the report of her hu&s;|band's &s;ituation. Your heart will con|ceive what &s;he &s;uffered far better than I can relate it. Three months after his

into the &s;ea, when he was prevented by the people near him, who &s;aid, that if he would pay the fees, his portmanteau &s;hould be &s;ent after him. He eagerly complied with their demands, and &s;et out for London. As he drew near, his anxiety, his impatience, his emotion increa&s;ed. His pre&s;ent &s;ituation appeared to him like one of tho&s;e delicious dreams, which &s;ometimes vi&s;ited the darkne&s;s of his dungeon, and for a while re&s;tored him, in imagination, to tho&s;e he loved. Scarcely could he per&s;uade him&s;elf that he was be|yond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion; that he was in a land of freedom; that he was ha&s;tening every moment towards his wife and child.

<P>SIX months after Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">'s return to England, his family found them|&s;elves compelled to &s;ilence the public cla|mours, by allowing him a &s;mall annual pen&s;ion.

<P>A young lady, who came to pay me a vi&s;it at London in 1785, de&s;ired to take &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in French, and Madame du

She at length told us the hi&s;tory of her misfor|tunes, with the pathetic eloquence of her own charming language; and, after ha|ving heard that recital, it required but common humanity, to treat her with the re&s;pect due to the unhappy, and to feel for her &s;orrows that &s;ympathy to which they had &s;uch claim.

<P>On the 7th of October, 1787, the Baron died, leaving, be&s;ides Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, two other &s;ons, and a daughter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here mention, that at the time when Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> was confined to his bed in the pri&s;on of St. Yon, from the

con&s;equences of his fall, his father, in order to avoid the clamours at Rouen, went for &s;ome weeks to Paris. He there made a will, di&s;inheriting his elde&s;t &s;on. By the old laws of France, however, a father could not puni&s;h his &s;on more than once for the &s;ame offence. Nor was there any thing in &s;o mild a clau&s;e that could much encourage di&s;obedience; &s;ince this &s;ingle puni&s;hment, of which the mercy of the law was careful to avoid repetition, might be extended to re&s;idence for life in a dungeon. Such was evidently the in|tention of the Baron du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">: and though his &s;on, di&s;appointing this inten|tion, had e&s;caped with only three years of captivity, and &s;ome broken limbs, the benignant law above-mentioned inter|po&s;ed to prevent farther puni&s;hment, and left the Baron without any legal right to deprive Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of his inheri|tance. His brothers, being &s;en&s;ible of this, wrote to inform him of his father's

The Baron having left all his papers &s;ealed up, which his younger &s;ons could not open but in the pre&s;ence of their brother, they ob|tained a revocation of the <HI>lettre-de-cachet,</HI> and &s;ent it to Mon&s;. du F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who im|mediately &s;et off for France.</P>

A-propos of poets.&mdash;The French have conquered many old prejudices, but their prejudice again&s;t Shake&s;peare &s;till exi&s;ts.

<P>WE left France early in September, that we might avoid the equinoctial gales; but were &s;o unfortunate as to meet, in our pa&s;&s;age from Dieppe to Brighton, with a very violent &s;torm. We were two days and two nights at &s;ea, and beat four and twenty hours off the coa&s;t of Brighton; and it would be difficult for you, who have formed your calculations of time on dry land, to gue&s;s what is the length of four and twenty hours in a &s;torm at &s;ea. At la&s;t, with great difficulty, we landed on the beach, where we found &s;everal of our friends and acquaintance, who, &s;up|po&s;ing that we might be among the pa&s;|&s;engers, &s;ympathi&s;ed with our danger, and were anxious for our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Before the &s;torm became &s;o &s;erious as
<PB N="216" REF="217">
to exclude every idea but that of prepa|ring to die with compo&s;ure, I could not help being diverted with the comments on French cu&s;toms, and French politics, which pa&s;&s;ed in the cabin. <Q REND="inline">Ah!</Q> &s;ays one man to his companion, <Q REND="inline">one had need to go to France, to know how to like old England when one gets back again.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">For my part,</Q> rejoined ano|ther, <Q REND="inline">I've never been able to get drunk once the whole time I was in France&mdash;not a drop of porter to be had&mdash;and as for their victuals, they call a bit of meat of a pound and a half, a fine piece of roa&s;t beef.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">And pray,</Q> added he, turning to one of the &s;ailors, <Q REND="inline">What do you think of their National A&s;&s;embly?</Q> <Q REND="inline">Why,</Q> &s;ays the &s;ailor, <Q REND="inline">if I ben't mi&s;|taken, the National A&s;&s;embly has got &s;ome points from the wind.</Q></P>

with the &s;ailor. Every vi&s;itor brings me intelligence from France full of di&s;|may and horror. I hear of nothing but crimes, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, torture, and death. I am told that every day witne&s;&s;es a con|&s;piracy; that every town is the &s;cene of a ma&s;&s;acre; that every &s;treet is blackened with a gallows, and every highway de|luged with blood. I hear the&s;e things, and repeat to my&s;elf,&mdash;Is this the picture of France? Are the&s;e the images of that univer&s;al joy, which called tears into my eyes, and made my heart throb with &s;ympathy?&mdash;To me, the land which the&s;e mighty magicians have &s;uddenly covered with darkne&s;s, where, waving their evil wand, they have reared the di&s;mal &s;caffold, have clotted the knife of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in with gore, have called forth the &s;hriek of de|&s;pair, and the agony of torture&mdash;to me, this land of de&s;olation appeared dre&s;&s;ed in additional beauty beneath the genial &s;mile of Liberty. The woods &s;eemed to ca&s;t a

more refre&s;hing &s;hade, and the lawns to wear a brighter verdure, while the carols of freedom bur&s;t from the cottage of the pea&s;ant, and the voice of joy re&s;ounded on the hill, and in the valley.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I be told, that my mind is per|verted, that I am become dead to all &s;en|&s;ations of &s;ympathy, becau&s;e I do not weep with tho&s;e who have lo&s;t a part of their &s;uperfluities, rather than rejoice that the oppre&s;&s;ed are protected, that the wronged are redre&s;&s;ed, that the captive is &s;et at li|berty, and that the poor have bread? Did the Univer&s;al Parent of the human race implant the feelings of pity in the heart, that they &s;hould be confined to the artifi|cial wants of vanity, the ideal deprivations of greatne&s;s; that they &s;hould be fixed beneath the dome of the palace, or locked within the gate of the <HI>ch&acirc;teau</HI>; without extending one commi&s;erating &s;igh to the wretched hamlet, as if its fami&s;hed inha|bitants, though not ennobled by <HI>man,</HI> did

not bear, at lea&s;t, the en&s;igns of nobility &s;tamped on our nature by God?</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I hear the charming &s;ocieties, in which I found all the elegant graces of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed manners, all the amiable urbanity of liberal and cultivated minds, compared with the mo&s;t rude, ferocious, and barbarous levellers that ever exi&s;ted? Really, &s;ome of my Engli&s;h acquaint|ance, whatever objections they may have to republican principles, do, in their di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions of French politics, adopt a mo&s;t free and republican &s;tyle of cen&s;ure. No|thing can be more democratical than their mode of expre&s;&s;ion, or di&s;play a more le|velling &s;pirit than their unqualified con|tempt of <HI>all</HI> the leaders of the revolu|tion.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to &s;hiver lances, in every &s;ociety I enter, in the cau&s;e of the National A&s;&s;embly. Yet I cannot help remarking, that, &s;ince the A&s;&s;embly does not pre&s;ume to &s;et it&s;elf up as an example

greater perfection, &s;eems to be pro&s;cri|bing every art and &s;cience: and we cannot much wonder that the French, ha|ving received &s;o &s;mall a legacy of public happine&s;s from their forefathers, and be|ing &s;en&s;ible of the poverty of their own patrimony, &s;hould try new methods of tran&s;mitting a richer inheritance to their po&s;terity.</P>

Perhaps our political plans may hitherto have been &s;omewhat like tho&s;e ill-con&s;tructed mis&s;hapen ve&s;|&s;els, which, unfit to combat with the winds and waves, were only u&s;ed by the ancients to convey the warriors of one country to de&s;poil and ravage another neighbouring &s;tate; which only &s;erved to produce an intercour&s;e of ho&s;tility, a com|munication of injury, an exchange of ra|pine

and deva&s;tation.&mdash;But it may po&s;|&s;ibly be within the compa&s;s of human ability to form a &s;y&s;tem of politics, which, like a modern &s;hip of di&s;covery, built upon principles that defy the oppo&s;ition of the tempe&s;tuous elements, ("and pa&s;|&s;ions are the elements of life"&mdash;) in&s;tead of yielding to their fury makes them &s;ub&s;ervient to its purpo&s;e, and &s;ailing &s;ublimely over the untracked ocean, unites tho&s;e together whom nature &s;eemed for ever to have &s;eparated, and throws a line of connexion acro&s;s the divided world.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of the general di&s;like in which the French revolution is held in this coun|try, is the exaggerated &s;tories which are carefully circulated by &s;uch of the ari&s;to|crates as have taken refuge in England. They are not all, however, per&s;ons of this de&s;cription. There is now a young gen|tleman in London, nephew to the Bi&s;hop de Sens, who has lo&s;t his fortune, his rank,

all his high expectations, and yet who has the genero&s;ity to applaud the revolution, and the magnanimity to reconcile him&s;elf to per&s;onal calamities, from the con&s;ide|ration of general good; and who is "faithful found" to his country, "among the faithle&s;s." I hope this amiable young Frenchman will live to witne&s;s, and to &s;hare the honours, the pro&s;perity, of that regenerated country; and I al&s;o hope that the National A&s;&s;embly of France will an&s;wer the objections of its adver&s;aries in the manner mo&s;t becoming its own dig|nity, by forming &s;uch a con&s;titution as will render the French nation virtuous, flouri&s;hing, and happy.</P>
