<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Book here pre&s;ented to the Public is compiled from
two of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and illu&s;trious philo&s;ophers that ever
flouri&s;hed in this part of the world. It has been their fate,
with other great and good men in all ages, to incur the deepe&s;t
obloquy, even in the in&s;tant of conferring on mankind the
mo&s;t la&s;ting and exten&s;ive benefits. Their works, however,
will endure as long as the language, and their names be recorded
with honour, while the hi&s;tory of <HI>Britain</HI> continues to intere&s;t
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The private characters of <HI>Hume</HI> and <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> exhibit no|thing
&s;trikingly &s;imilar, except their attachment to &s;tudy, and
eager pur&s;uit of literary Fame. The manners of the one were
&s;imple, plain, amiable, and engaging: tho&s;e of the other, rather
&s;totely, often a&s;&s;uming, and uniformly refined. The youth, as
well as manhood, of the fir&s;t, was &s;pent, under every circum|&s;tance
in which fortune placed him, in a &s;edulous and &s;ingle
attention to the cultivation and improvement of his literary
talents; that of the &s;econd, apparently without any view what|ever,
and in &s;cenes of the mo&s;t exceptionable di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P><HI>Hume</HI> maintained through life an un&s;ullied reputation for
every &s;pecies of virtue and worth. In company or out of it,
abroad or at home, his good-nature never for&s;ook him. His
temper was generally unruffled, even while the petulance of his
pious per&s;ecutors expo&s;ed him to the rude&s;t in&s;ult: and he
has been known to revi&s;e, with exemplary candour, the foule&s;t
libels, pre&s;ented to him under the name of An&s;wers to &s;ome
parts of his writings. The very poor in his neighbourhood,
though in&s;tigated by prie&s;tcraft to revile and execrate his opi|nions,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
regarded his benevolence and humanity with a mixture
of reverence and gratitude. His deportment on every occa&s;ion,
while eminently cha&s;te and manly, was altogether the rever&s;e
of pomp or o&s;tentation. Peculiarly affable and ea&s;y of acce&s;s,
he di&s;covered nothing of the &s;cholar, either in his appearance
or conver&s;ation; and all his attentions, being the &s;pontaneous
effu&s;ions of genuine philanthropy, were without ceremony or
parade. While his talents were vigorou&s;ly exerted to overturn
the &s;y&s;tem, his morals would have adorned the pure&s;t and mo&s;t
primitive ages, of Chri&s;tianity! And he was neither wanting
in that extraordinary &s;trength of mind, nor in that &s;ingular
goodne&s;s of heart, which in every country and period of human
&s;tory have always di&s;tingui&s;hed the greate&s;t and the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>To this high degree of excellence in the fir&s;t di&s;tinctions of
humanity, <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> had no claim. The &s;ublime&s;t theory of
virtue which his exalted genius could either conceive or recom|mend,
had yet but little influence on the management of his
pa&s;&s;ions. He was not a &s;peculative, only, but a practical, li|bertine.
Stationed for a great number of years, and during
&s;ome of the mo&s;t important periods of our hi&s;tory, in the giddy
vortex of public life, he was evidently too deeply engro&s;&s;ed and
agitated, to be much &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e tender endearments
which for the mo&s;t part prompt and accompany the exerci&s;e of
private and dome&s;tic virtue. But towards the evening of his
days, in a &s;ituation not a little &s;olitary and romantic, his ele|vated
and enlightened mind a&s;&s;umed a gravity and repo&s;e &s;uit|able
to that maje&s;tic and commanding tone which had ever cha|racteri&s;ed
its greate&s;t exertions. It was then only one of his
fonde&s;t admirers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord</HI> Orrery.</NOTE> remarks of him, that he united in conver&s;a|tion
the wi&s;dom of <HI>Socrates</HI> with the ardour of <HI>Plato,</HI> the dig|nity
and ea&s;e of <HI>Pliny</HI> with the wit and &s;prightline&s;s of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P>Different as the talents in writing of the&s;e eminent authors
certainly were, the many bright &s;pecimens of their ta&s;te and
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
genius, now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the public, di&s;cover a few points,
at lea&s;t, in which there is &s;till a very &s;triking likene&s;s. The
infinite and irreparable mi&s;chief done to &s;ociety by an affecta|tion
of religion, where the reality of it was wanting, betrayed
each of them into a mo&s;t implacable and unwarrantable aver&s;ion
to whatever bears the name: and under the obnoxious ma&s;que
of bigotry, the mo&s;t &s;acred feelings and regards of mankind
are treated with due re&s;pect by neither. Still a rich and &s;hining
variety of beautiful and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages, in the vicinity of
many very exceptionable ones, in both, have for this rea&s;on
been long lo&s;t to tho&s;e, e&s;pecially, on whom they were likely
to produce the be&s;t effects. And the de&s;ign of this little vo|lume
is to extract from a huge collection of &s;uch gro&s;s materials
&s;ome of the pure&s;t ore, to enli&s;t on the &s;ide of Virtue the
greate&s;t advocates for Infidelity, and to de&s;poil Vice of tho&s;e
meretricious weapons by which &s;he has done mo&s;t execution.</P>
<P><HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s genius was bold, picture&s;que, &s;plendid, and ora|torical;
that of <HI>Hume</HI> &s;eemed more acute, conci&s;e, and pene|trating.
The one is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a lofty and daring imagi|nation,
by an inexhau&s;tible brilliancy of ideas, and by a diction
peculiarly expre&s;&s;ive and tropical; the other, by a clear and &s;ub|til
under&s;tanding, by deep and accurate thinking, and by a &s;tyle
uniformly ea&s;y, emphatical, and elegant. The conceptions of
the fir&s;t were &s;o &s;trong and ardent, that he gra&s;ped at Truth by
a kind of intuitive violence, without &s;tooping to any of tho&s;e
&s;low and intermediate means by which &s;he conde&s;cends to be|come
acce&s;&s;ible to more ordinary minds: the &s;econd po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
all the powers of inve&s;tigation in &s;uch perfection, as induced
him to &s;pare no pains in the di&s;covery of this important object
by the humble and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, but certain mode of rea&s;on|ing.
Hi&s;tory and metaphy&s;ics were the favourite and mo&s;t
&s;ucce&s;sful &s;tudy of <HI>Hume: Bolingbroke's</HI> letters on the fir&s;t are
among the mo&s;t fini&s;hed of his productions; but he never lo&s;t
him&s;elf &s;o completely as when he plunged into the bottomle&s;s
aby&s;s of the &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">
Both of the&s;e two celebrated writers have inve&s;tigated, in a
ma&s;terly manner, the multifarious &s;cience of politics. Their
ideas, however, in a great variety of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tant
particulars, are e&s;&s;entially different. The rea&s;onings of
<HI>Hume,</HI> on all tho&s;e popular and con&s;titutional que&s;tions which
have been lately &s;o repeatedly and &s;o tenaciou&s;ly debated in the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;enate, like his Hi&s;tory, may be con&s;idered as a mo&s;t
ingenious and elegant apology for prerogative. His uncommon
talents are perpetually occupied, and not without &s;ucce&s;s, in
relaxing the general attachments of mankind to the important
ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, in reconciling them to every po&s;&s;ible modi|fication
of government, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their &s;entiments of inde|pendence,
and in &s;ugge&s;ting new arguments for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and
obedience. The opinions of <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> are not only more open
and decided, but uniformly on the &s;ide of freedom and the
rights of the &s;ubject, as &s;ettled at the Revolution. On this
delicate and intere&s;ting &s;ubject his productions are to this day
without a parallel. Politics &s;eem his own peculiar province, in
which, notwith&s;tanding his numerous compeers, he &s;till reigns
unrivalled. His <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on Parties,</HI> and <HI>Idea of a Patriot King,</HI>
are more replete than any thing el&s;e in the language with a
&s;eries of ob&s;ervations and rea&s;onings concerning the di&s;tinct
privileges of prince and people, equally pertinent, original, and
per&s;ua&s;ive. No where the dupe of tho&s;e chimerical illu&s;ions
and conjectures which confound the &s;hallow, and amu&s;e the
&s;peculative, the general principles on which his particular con|clu&s;ions
are built, have all a &s;old and permanent foundation in
fact, and the nature of things. His &s;ole and exclu&s;ive aim is to
graft the theory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution on ancient u&s;age,
and to reduce it to pre&s;ent practice.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem, &s;o lately and ably revived by his Grace the
Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> is an obvious improvement by our noble
author on that which chiefly produced the Revolution. As it
does honour to his genius, it could not have found a better ad|vocate.
He evidently writes from the heart, and, whatever he
<PB N="v" REF="6">
&s;ays, affects his readers with a forcible empha&s;is and propriety.
His conceptions, always formed with judgment and ta&s;te, are
every where delivered with earne&s;tne&s;s and energy. The digni|fied
manner in which he reprobates all tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h and accom|modating
principles, or maxims, which keep mo&s;t public men
in an infamous kind of equipo&s;&s;e between honour and intere&s;t,
peculiarly becomes him. It is the genuine, but indignant, lan|guage
of virtue, &s;purn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the in&s;idious approaches of vice under
the mo&s;t qualified and deceitful appearances. In one word, he
treats the whole &s;cience of government as proceeding regularly,
only when actuated by the great ma&s;ter-&s;prings of right and
wrong. This is the key-&s;tone or fir&s;t principle of all his
politics; and to this, not, like <HI>Hume,</HI> to the manners of the
age, and the depravity of human nature, he directed all his ar|guments,
and made all his appeals.</P>
<P>In the following &s;election, an equal attention is paid to the
morals of <HI>Hume</HI> and the politics of <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> We have enough
in all con&s;cience of that &s;ophi&s;try and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">inement in which the
la&s;t was &s;o great a ma&s;ter. He, perhaps, without intending,
has made it the cant of the day to &s;neer avowedly at whatever
bears the &s;emblance of principle in public life. The people of
<HI>England</HI> happily feel, and even begin at la&s;t to re&s;ent, the per|nicious
con&s;equences of this mo&s;t profligate and temporizing
&s;y&s;tem. <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s notions, on all points of pre&s;ent political
altercation or enquiry, are literally theirs. The &s;ub&s;tance of
what he thought and wrote, on whatever is mo&s;t valuable and
intere&s;ting in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, is here combined and ex|hibited.
And, to &s;ay the lea&s;t that can be &s;aid, it is &s;urely one
of the mo&s;t ine&s;timable legacies that ever a &s;tate&s;man bequeathed
to his country.</P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
DAVID HUME, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is con&s;tituted by nature, and moulded by habit, &s;o
mechanically, that every individual may be &s;aid to differ from
another as e&s;&s;entially in the bia&s;s of his mind, and the tempe|rature
of his heart, as in the features of his face. Whatever
makes this di&s;tinction, is that fixed and governing principle by
which character is formed and e&s;timated.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;ion for literature runs vi&s;ibly through the whole of
<HI>Hume</HI>'s life, and gives a colouring to all his actions. Here all
his wi&s;hes terminated; and, to accompli&s;h di&s;tinction in this
exclu&s;ive line, every other view or pro&s;pect of ambition was
&s;acrificed. Nor does he owe more of his &s;ucce&s;s to uncommon
ability and addre&s;s, perhaps, than to his &s;teady, ardent, and
unremitted pur&s;uit of one great and intere&s;ting concern. This,
at lea&s;t, clearly accounts for all that attachment to paradox and
pyrrhoni&s;m which &s;o &s;ingularly characteri&s;e his metaphy&s;ical
writings.</P>
<P>His parents were de&s;cended of a good family, and indepen|dent,
though not wealthy. He was born at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the
26th of <HI>April,</HI> 1711, old &s;tyle. His patrimony was but trifling,
as he was only a younger brother.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8">
That predilection for &s;tudy, which never for&s;ook him, di&s;|covered
it&s;elf at an early period. This, with his habits of in|du&s;try
and application, di&s;po&s;ed his friends to &s;ix on the law as
a proper profe&s;&s;ion for him. But he owns, while they thought
him poring on <HI>Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> and <HI>Vinnius,</HI> he was &s;ecretly devouring
<HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>Impelled, however, by the narrowne&s;s of his fortune, he
thought of &s;eriou&s;ly attaching him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s. For this
purpo&s;e he went to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> but, preferring retirement and
books to every other pur&s;uit and pro&s;pect, he &s;oon left <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
and repaired to <HI>France,</HI> where he could live at le&s;s expence, and
pro&s;ecute his literary views with equal advantage.</P>
<P>Partly at <HI>Rheims,</HI> but chiefly at <HI>La Fl&ecirc;che,</HI> in <HI>Anjou,</HI> he com|po&s;ed
his <HI>Treati&s;e of Human Nature.</HI> There he re&s;ided near
three years; and publi&s;hed this work &s;hortly after his return to
<HI>England.</HI> But, to u&s;e his own phra&s;e, it <HI>fell dead-born from the
pre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>He was more fortunate in the fir&s;t part of his <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> which
appeared originally at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in 1742. It is remarkable
that about this time, though &s;omewhat turned of thirty, he
recovered his knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> language, which he had
almo&s;t lo&s;t through negligence.</P>
<P>He went, in 1745, to live with the Marquis of <HI>Annandale,</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> on &s;pecial invitation; and, having undertook the
tuition of that nobleman's &s;on, he continued in this &s;ituation
for a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>As &s;ecretary to General <HI>St. Clair,</HI> he attended in an expedi|tion
on the coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and afterwards accompanied him in
his emba&s;&s;y to the courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="9">
The two years in which he was thus employed; were almo&s;t
the only interruption his general &s;tudies ever received. It was
now he republi&s;hed his fir&s;t performance under a new form;
but it &s;ucceeded little better than before.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appointment, his fertile mind &s;till
teemed with fre&s;h literary adventures. The &s;cenes he had
lately reviewed in his official capacity, probably opened to him
a variety of original &s;peculations; and &s;ome of his former pub|lications
gaining on the public e&s;timation; he was encouraged,
in 1752, to bring forth his <HI>Political Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> which had a
mo&s;t rapid &s;ale.</P>
<P>Soon after appeared his <HI>Enquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals;</HI> which, in his own opinion, is, of all his writings,
incomparably the be&s;t.</P>
<P>His next performance was the <HI>Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> which he
commenced with the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart</HI> to the
&s;overeignty of <HI>Britain.</HI> This work co&s;t him great pains, and
gave him much hope. It was received, however, &s;o coolly,
that he &s;carcely heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con|&s;iderable
for rank or letters, that could endure it. The two
Primates of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> were, indeed, exceptions odd
enough; who &s;ent him &s;eparate me&s;&s;ages, not to be di&s;cou|raged.
But it was then, perhaps, as now, when court-creepers,
or &s;ticklers for prerogative, are the mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in the
line of eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment. This di&s;appointment had al|mo&s;t
got the better of his re&s;olution; and a war, which at that
time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> was the only thing
that kept him from going into voluntary bani&s;hment. To this
accidental circum&s;tance we owe his completion of the mo&s;t
fini&s;hed and cla&s;&s;ical Hi&s;tory this or any other country ever
produced.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10">
<HI>The Natural Hi&s;tory of Religion</HI> was now publi&s;hed. This
gave a &s;erious alarm to the religious &s;entiments of his country|men.
Many indirect attacks were made on it; and it brought
on the author all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and &s;curri|lity,
of the <HI>Warburtonian</HI> &s;chool.</P>
<P>Two years &s;ub&s;equent to the fall of the fir&s;t, came out the
&s;econd volume of his Hi&s;tory, which brought it down from the
death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. to the Revolution. This made him &s;ome
amends for his other literary mi&s;carriages: it was a popular
performance, and not only rai&s;ed the character of the author,
but rendered the former volume of &s;ome reque&s;t.</P>
<P>His account of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Tudor</HI> was not publi&s;hed till
1759, and was then regarded with di&s;like, e&s;pecially in <HI>England.</HI>
This, however, did not deter him from fini&s;hing, in two vo|lumes,
the more early periods of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;tory, which he
gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable,
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He was then invited to attend the Earl of <HI>Hertford,</HI> on his
emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Paris;</HI> which, after &s;ome he&s;itation and reluctance,
he thought proper to accept. He &s;peaks with much &s;atisfaction
of the plea&s;ure he received from the connexions to which this
appointment introduced him.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Commander in Chief being appointed one of
his Maje&s;ty's principal Secretaries of State, in 1767, our author
was made Under-Secretary. In this department he continued
for near two years, and went out with the then Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>He now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and pounds of yearly revenue, and
returned to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> with the fond hopes of long enjoying,
at his lei&s;ure, and among his friends, the honourable rewards
of his great talents and great indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11">
In about half a dozen years he was &s;eized, however, with
a di&s;order in his bowels, which at fir&s;t gave him no alarm, but
which &s;oon became incurable. He did not die till &s;everal
months after having given up all hopes of life. He &s;uffered
but little pain, and retained his faculties and &s;pirits to the
very la&s;t.</P>
<P>He pronounces his own oulogium in a manner that &s;hews
how well he de&s;erved it. We in&s;ert it in this place as none of
the lea&s;t beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in his works.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was a man of mild di&s;po&s;ition, of command of temper,
of an open, &s;ocial, and cheerful humour, capable of attach|ment,
but little &s;u&s;ceptible of enmity, and of great moderation
in all my pa&s;&s;ions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling
pa&s;&s;ion, never &s;oured my temper, notwith&s;tanding my frequent
di&s;appointments. My company was not unacceptable to the
young and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">arele&s;s, as well as to the &s;tudious and literary; and
as I took a particular plea&s;ure in the company of mode&s;t wo|men,
I had no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the reception I met
with from them. In a word, though mo&s;t men any wi&s;e emi|nent,
have found rea&s;on to complain of Calumny, I never was
touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth; and though I
wantonly expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the rage of both civil and religious
factions, they &s;eemed to be di&s;armed, in my behalf, of their
wanted fury. My friends never had occa&s;ion to vindicate any
one circum&s;tance of my character and conduct: not but that
the zealots, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, would have been glad to in|vent
and propagate any &s;tory to my di&s;advantage; but they
could never find any which they thought would wear the face of
probability. I cannot &s;ay there is no vanity in making this
funeral oration of my&s;elf, but I hope it is not a mi&s;placed one;
and this is a matter of fact which is ea&s;ily cleared and a&s;cer|tained."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12">
The &s;ame experimental mode of philo&s;ophizing which the
great <HI>Bacon</HI> recommends, and which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully
applied by <HI>Locke</HI> to metaphy&s;ics, and by <HI>Newton</HI> to phy&s;ical phae|nomena,
our author uniformly adopts in all his di&s;qui&s;itions on
morals and human nature. It is in this &s;y&s;tematic and rational
u&s;e of facts his chief excellence as an author and philo&s;opher
lies. Perhaps it may be &s;aid of him, what <HI>Pope</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Boling|broke,
If ever he trifies, it may be when he turns Divine.</HI></P>
<P>Many have lamented much, that ever his great abilities pro|duced
any thing inimical to Chri&s;tianity. It afforded, however,
one very important example of decency and command of temper
to all her friends and apologi&s;ts. For whatever obligations &s;he
may have to many of their labours, &s;he has none to &s;ome di&s;|po&s;itions
di&s;covered in her behalf.</P>
<P>Our author began his literary career with a re&s;olution, which
he inflexibly maintained through life, never to reply to any
body: and not being very ira&s;cible in his temper, he ea&s;ily
kept clear of all literary &s;quabbles. The unmanly &s;arca&s;ms
even of a <HI>Beattie,</HI> the mo&s;t illiberal and virulent of all his anta|goni&s;ts,
never extorted from him a &s;ingle invective. He regarded
his furious declamation only as &s;o much froth, which he well
knew would &s;ub&s;ide, and be forgotten, the moment the vapour
that produced it vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>About this time, a quarto edition of his <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> was pub|li&s;hed,
in two volumes; to one of which the following Adver|ti&s;ement
was prefixed: <Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t of the principles and rea&s;onings
contained in this volume, were publi&s;hed in a work, in three
volumes, intitled, <HI>A Treati&s;e of Human Nature;</HI> a work which
the author had projected before he left college, and which he

he was &s;en&s;ible of his error in going to the pre&s;s too
early, and he ca&s;t the whole a-new in the following pieces;
where &s;ome negligences in his former rea&s;oning, and more in

who have honoured the author's philo&s;ophy with an&s;wers,
have taken care to direct all their batteries again&s;t that juve|nile
work, which the author never acknowledged; and have
affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined
they had obtained over it: a practice very contrary to all rules
of candour and fair dealing, and a &s;trong in&s;tance of tho&s;e
polemical artifices which a bigoted zeal thinks it&s;elf autho|ri&s;ed
to employ."</Q></P>
<P>This Life we &s;hall conclude with a Note, occa&s;ioned by a
Reply to his E&s;&s;ay on the <HI>Populou&s;ne&s;s of ancient Nations.</HI> This
Reply was written by a late eminent Divine, of the church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> who di&s;covered on this, as on all other occa&s;ions, &s;uch
a manly attention to truth, as precluded the impertinent inter|ference
of every other pa&s;&s;ion. Our author takes notice of this
re&s;pectful an&s;wer in a manner equally honourable to both. The
Note is pre&s;erved in none of the later editions of his works.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"AN ingenious writer has honoured this di&s;cour&s;e with an
an&s;wer, full of politene&s;s, erudition, and good-&s;en&s;e. So learned
a refutation would have made the author &s;u&s;pect that his rea&s;on|ings
were entirely overthrown, had he not u&s;ed the precaution,
from the beginning, to keep him&s;elf on the &s;ceptical &s;ide; and,
having taken this advantage of the ground, he was enabled,
though with much inferior forces, to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from a
total defeat. That Reverend Gentleman will always find, where
his antagoni&s;t is &s;o entrenched, that it will be difficult to force
him. <HI>Varro,</HI> in &s;uch a &s;ituation, could defend him&s;elf again&s;t
<HI>Hannibal, Pharnaces</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> The author very willingly
acknowledges that his antagoni&s;t has detected many mi&s;takes in
his authorities and rea&s;onings; and it was owing entirely to that
Gentleman's indulgence, that many more errors were not re|marked.
In this edition, advantage has been taken of his
learned animadver&s;ions, and the E&s;&s;ay has been rendered le&s;s
imperfect than formerly."</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
HENRY ST. JOHN,
LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY ST. JOHN,</HI> Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> was born
in the year 1672, at <HI>Batter&s;ea,</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> at a &s;eat that had
been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tors for ages before. His fa|mily
was of the fir&s;t rank, equally con&s;picuous for its antiquity,
dignity, and large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It is found to trace its original
as high as <HI>Adam de Port,</HI> Baron of <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> before
the Conque&s;t; and, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, to have produced
warrio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s, patriots, and &s;tate&s;men; &s;ome of whom were con&s;pi|cuous
for their loyalty, and others for their defending the rights
of the people. His grandfather, Sir <HI>Walter St. John,</HI> of <HI>Bat|ter&s;ea.</HI>
marrying one of the daughters of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice
<HI>St. John,</HI> who, as all know, was &s;trongly attached to the Re|publican
party, <HI>Henry,</HI> the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent memoir, was
brought up in his family, and con&s;equently imbibed the fir&s;t
principles of his education among&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Nature &s;eemed not le&s;s kind to him in her external embel|li&s;hments,
than in adorning his mind. With the graces of an
hand&s;ome per&s;on, and a face in which dignity was happily
blended with &s;weetne&s;s, he had a manner of addre&s;s that was
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
very engaging. His vivacity was always awake, his apprehen|&s;ion
was quick, his wit refined, and his memory amazing:
his &s;ubtilty in thinking and rea&s;oning was profound; and all
the&s;e talents were adorned with an elocution that was irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>To the a&s;&s;emblage of &s;o many gifts from Nature, it was ex|pected
that Art would &s;oon give her fini&s;hing hand; and that
a youth begun in excellence, would &s;oon arrive at perfection:
but &s;uch is the perver&s;ene&s;s of human nature, that an age
which &s;hould have been employed in the acqui&s;ition of know|ledge,
was di&s;&s;ipated in plea&s;ure; and, in&s;tead of aiming to ex|cel
in prai&s;e-worthy pur&s;uits, <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> &s;eemed more ambitious
of being thought the greate&s;t rake about town.</P>
<P>In this mad career of plea&s;ure he continued for &s;ome time;
but at length, in 1700, when he arrived at the twenty-eighth
year of his age, he began to take a di&s;like to his method of
living, and to find that &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure alone was not &s;ufficient
to make the happine&s;s of a rea&s;onable creature. He therefore
made his fir&s;t effort to break from his &s;tate of infatuation, by
marrying the daughter and coheire&s;s of Sir <HI>Henry Winche&s;comb,</HI>
a de&s;cendant from the famous <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Newbury,</HI> who, though
but a clothier, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was able to enter|tain
the King, and all his retinue, in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner.
This Lady was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune exceeding forty thou&s;and
pounds, and was not deficient in mental accompli&s;hments; but
whether he was not yet fully &s;atiated with his former plea&s;ures,
or whether her temper was not conformable to his own, it is
certain they were far from living happily together. After co|habiting
for &s;ome time together, they parted by mutual con|&s;ent,
both equally di&s;plea&s;ed; he complaining of the ob&s;tinacy
of her temper, &s;he of the &s;hamele&s;sne&s;s of his infidelity. A
great part of her fortune, &s;ome time after, upon his attainder,
was given her back; but as her family e&s;tates were &s;ettled upon
him, he enjoyed them after her death, upon the rever&s;al of his
attainder.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="16">
It is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to the public life of this great
man, without giving a particular detail of politics for a great
number of years. His eloquence, abilities, and influence, &s;oon
brought him forward in the &s;ervice of his country. The latter
end of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s reign &s;eems the period in which, of all
others, his capacity as a &s;tate&s;man and mini&s;ter &s;hone with the
greate&s;t lu&s;tre. That critical juncture called for the exertion of
all his eminent qualities; and it is agreed, that he managed the
contending factions which then divided the nation, a mo&s;t ex|pen&s;ive
continental war, an intriguing court, and a fickle Queen,
with an addre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s equally exqui&s;ite and unexpected.</P>
<P>While thus indu&s;triou&s;ly employed, he was not without the
rewards that de&s;erved to follow &s;uch abilities, joined to &s;o much
a&s;&s;iduity. In <HI>July</HI> 1712, he was created Baron <HI>St. John,</HI> of
<HI>Lidyard Tregoze,</HI> in <HI>Witt&s;hire,</HI> and Vi&s;count <HI>Bolingbroke;</HI> by the
la&s;t of which titles he is now generally known, and is likely to
be talked of by po&s;terity. He was al&s;o the &s;ame year appointed
Lord-Lieutenant of the county of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> By the titles of <HI>Tre|goze</HI>
and <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> he united the honours of the elder and
younger branch of his family; and thus tran&s;mitted into one
channel, the oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts of two races, that had been di|&s;tingui&s;hed,
one for their loyalty to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the other
for their attachment to the Parliament that oppo&s;ed him. It
was afterwards his boa&s;t, that he &s;teered clear of the extremes
for which his ance&s;tors had been di&s;tingui&s;hed, having kept the
&s;pirit of freedom of the one, and acknowledged the &s;ubordina|tion
that di&s;tingui&s;hed the other.</P>
<P>His quarrel with <HI>Oxford,</HI> whom he de&s;pi&s;ed, expo&s;ed both to
the mo&s;t imminent de&s;truction. So noble a mind was above
harbouring groundle&s;s re&s;entments, but no conce&s;&s;ions could re|concile
him to the ba&s;e or worthle&s;s.</P>
<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>George</HI> the Fir&s;t, he &s;hared the ruin of
his party; and, as one of their leaders, accumulated mo&s;t of
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
the odium their mea&s;ures had incurred. The revenge of his
enemies, who had now wriggled them&s;elves into power, made
it un&s;afe for him to &s;tay longer in <HI>England.</HI> Immediately on
his departure for <HI>France,</HI> a bill of attainder was preferred again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>It was now, partly from re&s;entment and di&s;gu&s;t, and partly
from a &s;trong predilection for the bu&s;tle of office, but chiefly to
gratify his boundle&s;s ambition, that he joined the Pretender.
But in this new &s;ervice he found every thing &s;o very mean and
mortifying, that he never appeared hearty in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Nor
was he treated with that confidence and cordiality, to which he
thought the &s;acrifices he made, and his con&s;cious ability, ju&s;tly
intitled him. It was his aim always to be foremo&s;t in every
admini&s;tration, and he could not bear to act as a &s;ubaltern in &s;o
paltry a court as that of the Pretender. Within le&s;s than a
twelvemonth he was therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and even &s;erved with
a mock impeachment, by his new ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This fortunate accident awakened all his &s;en&s;ibility, and
made him long, more than ever, for a participation of tho&s;e
liberties, the malice of his per&s;ecutors had tempted him to forfeit.
To the intrigues of the court, perhaps, more than to the inter|ference
of friends, or any other cau&s;e, he owed the accompli&s;h|ment
of this de&s;irable event. During this interval, notwith|&s;tanding
the painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him, he
wrote <HI>Reflections on Exile,</HI> one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly, the mo&s;t
elegant, and the mo&s;t affecting moral compo&s;itions in our lan|guage.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Lady, with whom he had not cohabited for years,
being now dead, he married a &s;econd time, and, on his return
to <HI>England,</HI> devoted his time entirely to a country life, the
charms of philo&s;ophy, and dome&s;tic happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="18">
Ob&s;curity, however, was not his element. While his friends
thought him reconciled to his fate, he &s;ecretly &s;ighed to emerge
a-new in a public capacity. But the mini&s;ter of the day
dreaded his abilities and virtues. He petitioned the Hou&s;e of
Commons to be rein&s;tated in his former emoluments and capa|cities:
but the cabals of the cabinet defeated his wi&s;hes. This
in&s;tigated him to take part with <HI>Pultney,</HI> in his oppo&s;ition to
<HI>Walpole.</HI> The la&s;t engaged to manage the Hou&s;e of Commons,
and the fir&s;t to open the eyes of the people.</P>
<P>This great political controver&s;y la&s;ted ten years; in the cour&s;e
of which, our noble author elucidated all the beauties and ex|cellencies
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution with &s;ingular elegance and
per&s;picuity. His &s;y&s;tem of politics is certainly the mo&s;t com|plete
and &s;atisfactory of any in the language. Happily for this
country, it is now popular and predominant. And in our ex|cerpts
from his writings, re&s;pect has been chiefly had to tho&s;e
leading ideas of mini&s;ters, government, and the con&s;titution,
which coincide mo&s;t with the general &s;entiments of the nation
on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted with all parties, and apparently tired of every pur|&s;uit,
he once more took leave of <HI>England,</HI> and retired to <HI>France.</HI>
But even in &s;olitude his hours did not glide away in torpid in|activity.
Having no further chance of ruling his cotemporaries,
he revolved on &s;ecuring the applaute and gratitude of po&s;terity.
This laudable object he pur&s;ued, with dignity and &s;ucce&s;s, in a
cour&s;e of <HI>Letters on the Study of Hi&s;tory;</HI> which exhibit the deli|ca,
of his ta&s;te, the energy of his mind, and the &s;en&s;ibility of
his heart, in the mo&s;t amiable and u&s;eful point of view.</P>
<P>It was here too, that, in a Letter addre&s;&s;ed to Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t,</HI>
he apologizes for his attachment to retirement and &s;tudy. This
Letter, like all his political writings, di&s;covers much political
di&s;cernment, and has, what is wanting in mo&s;t of them, great
moderation, and &s;ome fine morality.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="19">
Yet &s;till, amid&s;t his re&s;olutions to turn him&s;elf from politics,
and to give him&s;elf up entirely to the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s of philo&s;ophy, he
could not re&s;i&s;t embarking once more in the debates of his
country; and, coming back from <HI>France,</HI> &s;ettled as <HI>Batter&s;ea,</HI>
an old &s;eat which was his father's, and had been long in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family. He &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;aw an impending
calamity; and, thought it was not in his power to remove, he
thought it his duty to retard its fall. To redeem or &s;ave the
nation from perdition, he thought impo&s;&s;ible; &s;ince national
corruptions were to be purged by national calamities: but he
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">olved to &s;end his feeble a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to item the torrent that
was pouring in. With this &s;pirit he wrote that excellent piece;
which is intit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, <HI>The Idea of a Patriot King:</HI> in which he de|&s;cribes
a Monarch uninfluenced by party, leaning to the &s;ug|ge&s;tions
neither of Whigs no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tories, but equally the friend
and father of all Some time after, in the year 1749, after
the conclu&s;ion of the peace, two years before the mea&s;ures
taken by the admini&s;tration &s;eemed not to have been repugnant
to his notions of political prudence for that juncture; in that
year he wrote his la&s;t production, containing Reflections on the
then State of the Nation, principally with regard to her Taxes
and Debts, and on the Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences of them. This
undertaking was left unfini&s;hed; for Death &s;natched the pen
from the hand of the writer.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the latter part of his life in dignity and &s;plen|dour,
his rational faculties improved by reflection, and his am|bition
kept under by di&s;appointment, his whole aim &s;eemed to
have been to leave the &s;tage of life, on which he had acted &s;uch
various parts, with applau&s;e. He had long withed to fetch his
la&s;t breath at <HI>Batter&s;ea,</HI> the place whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">e he was born; and For|tune,
that had through life &s;eemed to traver&s;e all his aims, at
la&s;t indulged him in this. He had long been troubled with a
cancer in his cheek; by which excruciating di&s;ea&s;e he died, on
the verge of four&s;core years of age. He was con&s;onant with
him&s;elf to the la&s;t; and tho&s;e principles which he had all along
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
avowed, he confirmed with his dying breath; having given
orders that none of the clergy &s;hould be permitted to trouble
him in his late&s;t moments.</P>
<P>In this manner lived and died Lord <HI>Bolingbroke;</HI> ever active,
never depre&s;&s;ed; ever pur&s;uing Fortune, and as con&s;tantly di&s;|appointed
by her. In whatever light we view his character,
we &s;hall find him an object rather proper for our wonder, than
our imitation; more to be feared than e&s;teemed, and gaining
our admiration without our love. His ambition ever aimed at
the &s;ummit of power; and nothing &s;eemed capable of &s;atisfying
his immoderate de&s;ires, but the liberty of governing all things
without a rival. With as much ambition, as great abilities, and
more acquired knowledge than <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> he wanted only his cou|rage
to be as &s;ucce&s;sful; but the &s;chemes his head dictated, his
heart often refu&s;ed to execute; and he lo&s;t the ability to per|form,
ju&s;t when the great occa&s;ion called for all his efforts to
engage.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ambition that prompted him to be a politician,
actuated him as a philo&s;opher. His aims were equally great
and exten&s;ive in both capacities. Unwilling to &s;ubmit to any
power in the one, or any authority in the other, he entered the
fields of &s;cience with a thorough contempt of all that had been
e&s;tabli&s;hed before him; and &s;eemed to think every thing wrong,
that he might &s;hew his faculty in the reformation. It might
have been better for his quiet, as a man, if he had been con|tent
to act a &s;ubordinate character in the &s;tate; and it had cer|tainly
been better for his memory as a writer, if he had aimed
at doing le&s;s than he attempted. Wi&s;dom in morals, like every
other art or &s;cience, is an accumulation that numbers have con|tributed
to increa&s;e; and it is not for one &s;ingle man to pretend,
that he can add more to the heap than the thou&s;ands that have
gone before him. Such innovators more frequently retard than
promote knowledge; their maxims are more agreeable to the
reader, by having the glo&s;s of novelty to recommend them,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
than tho&s;e which are trite, only becau&s;e they are true. Such
men are therefore followed, at fir&s;t, with avidity; nor is it till
&s;ome time that their di&s;ciples begin to find their error. They
often, though too late, perceive, that they have been following
a &s;peculative enquiry, while they have been leaving a practical
good; and, while they have been practi&s;ing the arts of doubting,
they have been lo&s;ing all firmne&s;s of principle, which might
tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the rectitude of their private conduct. As a
morali&s;t, therefore, Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> by having endeavoured at
too much, &s;eems to have done nothing; but as a political
writer, few can equal, and none can exceed him. As he was a
practical po&s;icician, his writings are le&s;s filled with tho&s;e &s;pecu|lative
illu&s;ions, which are the re&s;ult of &s;olitude and &s;eclu&s;ion.
He wrote them with a certainty of their being oppo&s;ed, &s;ifted,
examined, and reviled; he therefore took care to build them
up of &s;uch materials as could not be ea&s;ily overthrown: they
prevailed at the times in which they were written; they &s;till
continue to be the admiration of the pre&s;ent age, and will pro|bably
la&s;t for ever.</P>

<HEAD>THE GOLDEN AGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ea&s;ons, in this fir&s;t period of nature,
were &s;o temperate, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity
for men to provide them&s;elves with clothes and
hou&s;es, as a &s;ecurity again&s;t the violence of heat
and cold. The rivers flowed with wine and milk.
The oaks yielded honey; and nature &s;pontane|ou&s;ly
produced her greate&s;t delicacies. Nor were
the&s;e the chief advantages of that happy age.
Tempe&s;ts were not alone removed from nature;
but tho&s;e more furious tempe&s;ts were unknown to
human brea&s;ts, which now cau&s;e &s;uch uproar, and
engender &s;uch confu&s;ion. Avarice, ambition, cru|elty,
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, were never heard of: cordial af|fection,
compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ympathy, were the only
movements with which the mind was yet ac|quainted.
Even the punctilious di&s;tinction of <HI>mine</HI>
and <HI>thine</HI> was bani&s;hed from among that happy
race of mortals, and carried with it the very no|tion
<PB N="2" REF="33">
of property and obligation, ju&s;tice and in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that nature has be&s;towed on the
human race &s;uch profu&s;e abundance of all external
conveniences, that without any uncertainty in the
event, without any care or indu&s;try on our part,
every individual finds him&s;elf fully provided with
whatever his mo&s;t voracious appetites can want,
or luxurious imagination wi&s;h or de&s;ire. His na|tural
beauty, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all acquired
ornaments. The perpetual clemency of the &s;ea&s;on
renders u&s;ele&s;s all clothes or covering. The raw
herbage affords him the mo&s;t delicious fare; the
clear fountain, the riche&s;t beverage. No laborious
occupation required; no tillage; no navigation.
Mu&s;ic, poetry, and contemplation, form his &s;ole
bu&s;ine&s;s; conver&s;ation, mirth, and friend&s;hip, his
&s;ole amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Thus the Hours pa&s;s unperceived along, and
lead in their wanton train all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e,
and all the joys of harmony and friend&s;hip Smi|ling
<HI>Innocence</HI> clo&s;es the proce&s;&s;ion; and, while &s;he
pre&s;ents her&s;elf to our ravi&s;hed eyes, &s;he embel|li&s;hes
the whole &s;cene, and renders the view of
the&s;e plea&s;ures as tran&s;porting after they have
pa&s;&s;ed us, as when, with langui&s;hing counte|nances,
they were yet advancing towards us.</P>

<HEAD>HUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>When <HI>Pericles,</HI> the great <HI>Athenian</HI> &s;tate&s;man and
general, was on his death-bed, his &s;urrounding
friends, deeming him now in&s;en&s;ible, began to in|dulge
their &s;orrow for their expiring patron, by
enumerating his great qualities and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, his
conque&s;ts and victories, the unu&s;ual length of his
admini&s;tration, and his nine trophies erected over
the enemies of the republic. 'You forget,' cries
the dying hero, who had heard all, 'you forget
the mo&s;t eminent of my prai&s;es, while you dwell
&s;o much on tho&s;e vulgar advantages in which
fortune had the principal &s;hare. You have not
ob&s;erved, that no citizen has ever yet worn
mourning on my account.'</P>
<P>While the human heart is compounded of the
&s;ame elements as at pre&s;ent, it will never be whol|ly
indifferent to the public good, nor entirely
unaffected with the tendency of characters and
manners: and, though this affection of humanity
may not generally be e&s;teemed &s;o &s;trong as vanity
or ambition, yet, being common to all men, it
can alone be the foundation of morals, or of any
general &s;y&s;tem of blame or prai&s;e. One man's
ambition is not another's ambition; nor will the
&s;ame event or object &s;atisfy both: but the huma|nity
of one man is the humanity of every one;
and the &s;ame object touches this pa&s;&s;ion in all hu|man
creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="35">
Does the &s;age pre&s;erve him&s;elf always in this
philo&s;ophic indifference, and re&s;t contented with
lamenting the mi&s;eries of mankind, without ever
employing him&s;elf for their relief? Does he con|&s;tantly
indulge this &s;evere wi&s;dom, which, by pre|tending
to elevate him above human accidents,
does in reality harden his heart, and render him
carele&s;s of the intere&s;t of mankind, and of &s;ociety?
No; he knows that in this &s;ullen apathy neither
true wi&s;dom, nor true happine&s;s, is to be found.
He feels too &s;trongly the charm of the &s;ocial affec|tions,
ever to counteract &s;o &s;weet, &s;o natural, &s;o
virtuous a propen&s;ity. Even when bathed in tears,
he laments the mi&s;eries of the human race, of his
country, of his friends; and, unable to give &s;uc|cour,
can only relieve them by compa&s;&s;ion; he yet
rejoices in the generous di&s;po&s;ition, and feels a
&s;atisfaction &s;uperior to that of the mo&s;t indulged
&s;en&s;e. So engaging are the &s;entiments of huma|nity,
that they brighten up the very face of &s;or|row,
and operate like the &s;un, which, &s;hining on
a du&s;ky cloud or falling rain, paints on them the
mo&s;t glorious colours that are to be found in the
whole circle of nature!</P>
<P>Knowledge in the arts of government naturally
begets mildne&s;s and moderation, by in&s;tructing
men in the advantages of humane maxims, above
rigour and &s;everity, which drive &s;ubjects into re|bellion,
and make the return to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion im|practicable,
by cutting off all hopes of pardon
<PB N="5" REF="36">
When the tempers of men are &s;oftened, as well as
their knowledge improved, this humanity appears
&s;till more con&s;picuous, and is the chief charac|teri&s;tic
which di&s;tingui&s;hes a civilized age from
times of barbarity and ignorance. Factions are
then le&s;s inveterate, revolutions le&s;s tragical, au|thority
le&s;s &s;evere, and &s;editions le&s;s frequent.
Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty; and,
after the field of battle, where honour and intere&s;t
&s;teel men again&s;t compa&s;&s;ion as well as fear, the
combatants dive&s;t them&s;elves of the brute, and re|&s;ume
the man.</P>
<P>What charms are there in the harmony of minds,
and in a friend&s;hip founded on mutual e&s;teem and
gratitude! What &s;atisfaction in relieving the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in comforting the afflicted, in rai&s;ing
the fallen, and in &s;topping the career of cruel
fortune, or of more cruel man, in their in&s;ults
over the good and virtuous!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>THE VOLUPTUARY.</HEAD>
<P>I examine the voluptuous man before enjoy|ment;
I mea&s;ure the vehemence of his de&s;ire, and
the importance of his object; I find that all his
happine&s;s proceeds only from that hurry of thought
which takes him from him&s;elf, and turns his views
from his guilt and mi&s;ery. I con&s;ider him a mo|ment
after:&mdash;he has now enjoyed the plea&s;ure
which he fondly &s;ought after. The &s;en&s;e of his
guilt and mi&s;ery returns upon him with double
<PB N="6" REF="37">
angui&s;h: his mind tormented with fear and re|mor&s;e;
his body depre&s;&s;ed with di&s;gu&s;t and &s;atiety.</P>
<P>The joys of love, however furious and tumul|tuous,
bani&s;h not the tender &s;entiments of &s;ympa|thy
and affection: they even derive their chief in|fluence
from that generous pa&s;&s;ion; and, when pre|&s;ented
alone, afford nothing to the unhappy mind,
but la&s;&s;itude and di&s;gu&s;t. Behold the &s;prightly de|bauchee,
who profe&s;&s;es a contempt of all other plea|&s;ures
but tho&s;e of wine and jollity: &s;eparate him
from his companions, like a &s;park from a fire,
where before it contributed to the general blaze;
his alacrity &s;uddenly extinguishes; and though &s;ur|rounded
with every other means of delight, he
loaths the &s;umptuous banquet, and prefers even the|mo&s;t
ab&s;tract &s;tudy and &s;peculation, as more agree|able
and entertaining.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>INHUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>The inhuman &s;ports exhibited at <HI>Rome,</HI> may ju&s;tly
be con&s;idered as an effect of the people's contempt
for &s;laves, and was al&s;o a great cau&s;e of the general
inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can
read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertain|ments
without horror? or who is &s;urpri&s;ed that the
emperors &s;hould treat that people in the &s;ame way
the people treated their inferiors? One's humanity
on that occa&s;ion is apt to renew the barbarous wi&s;h
of <HI>Caligula,</HI> that the people had but one neck:
<PB REF="38">
a man could almo&s;t be plea&s;ed, by a &s;ingle blow, to
put an end to &s;uch a race of mon&s;ters!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE is a re&s;tle&s;s and impatient pa&s;&s;ion, full of
caprices and variations; ari&s;ing in a moment from a
feature, from an air, from nothing; and &s;uddenly
extingui&s;hing after the &s;ame manner. Such a pa&s;|&s;ion
requires liberty above all things; and therefore
<HI>Eloi&s;a</HI> had rea&s;on when, in order to pre&s;erve this
pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he refu&s;ed to marry her beloved <HI>Abelard.</HI></P>

them nearer that model of perfection which it de|&s;cribes.
Ab&s;tru&s;e philo&s;ophy, being founded on a

ea&s;ily retain any influence over our conduct

<HEAD>GALLANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>TO correct &s;uch gro&s;s vices as lead us to commit
real injury on others, is the part of morals, and
the object of the mo&s;t ordinary education. Where
that is not attended to, in &s;ome degree, no human
&s;ociety can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But, in order to render conver|&s;ation,
and the intercour&s;e of minds, more ea&s;y and
agreeable, good-manners have been invented, and
have carried the matter &s;omewhat farther. Where|ever
nature has given the mind a propen&s;ity to any
vice, or to any pa&s;&s;ion di&s;agreeable to others, re|fined
breeding has taught men to throw the bia&s;s
on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and to pre&s;erve in all their
behaviour the appearance of &s;entiments different
from tho&s;e to which they naturally incline. Thus,
as we are commonly proud and &s;elfi&s;h, and apt to
a&s;&s;ume the preference above others, a polite man
learns to behave with deference towards his com|panions,
and to yield the &s;uperiority to them in all
the common incidents of &s;ociety. In like manner,
wherever a per&s;on's &s;ituation may naturally beget
any di&s;agreeable &s;u&s;picion in him, it is the part of
good-manners to prevent it by a &s;tudied di&s;play of
&s;entiments directly contrary to tho&s;e of which he
is apt to be jealous. Thus, old men know their
<PB N="29" REF="60">
infirmities, and naturally dread contempt from the
youth; hence, well-educated youth redouble the
in&s;tances of re&s;pect and deference to their elders.
Strangers and foreigners are without protection;
hence, in all polite countries, they receive the
highe&s;t civilities., and are intitled to the fir&s;t place
in every company. A man is lord in his own fa|mily,
and his gue&s;ts are, in a manner, &s;ubject to
his authority; hence, he is always the lowe&s;t per|&s;on
in the company; attentive to the wants of every
one; and giving him&s;elf all the trouble, in order
to plea&s;e, which may not betray too vi&s;ible an af|fectation,
or impo&s;e too much con&s;traint on his
gue&s;ts. Gallantry is nothing but an in&s;tance of
the &s;ame generous attention. As nature has given
man the &s;uperiority above woman, by endowing
him with greater &s;trength both of mind and body,
it is his part to alleviate that &s;uperiority, as much
as po&s;&s;ible, by the genero&s;ity of his behaviour, and
by a &s;tudied deference for all her inclinations and
opinions. Barbarous nations di&s;play this &s;uperio|rity
by reducing their females to the mo&s;t abject
&s;lavery; by confining, them, by beating them, by
&s;elling them, by killing them. But the male &s;ex
among a polite people di&s;cover their authority in a
more generous, though not a le&s;s evident manner;
by civility, by re&s;pect, by complai&s;ance, and, in
a word, by gallantry. In good company, you need
not a&s;k who is the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t. The man
who &s;its in the lowe&s;t place, and who is always indu&s;|trious
in helping every one, is certainly the per&s;on.

We mu&s;t either condemn all &s;uch in&s;tances of ge|nero&s;ity

<P>Gallantry is not le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with wi&s;dom and
prudence, than with nature and genero&s;ity; and,
when under proper regulations, contributes more
than any other invention to the entertainment and

omens, oracles, judgments, quite ob&s;cure the few

<HEAD>LUXURY.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY, or a refinement on the plea&s;ures

the &s;ource of every corruption in government, and
the immediate cau&s;e of faction, &s;edition, civil wars,
and the total lo&s;s of liberty: it was therefore uni|ver&s;ally

Tho&s;e who prove, or attempt to prove, that &s;uch

<P>Let us con&s;ider what we call vicious luxury.
No gratification, however &s;en&s;ual, can of it&s;elf be

when it engro&s;&s;es all a man's expence, and leaves
no ability for &s;uch acts of duty and genero&s;ity as
are required by his &s;ituation and fortune. Sup|po&s;e

that he correct the vice, and employ part of his
expence in the education of his children, in the &s;up|port
of his friends, and in relieving the poor; would
any prejudice re&s;ult to &s;ociety? On the contrary,
the &s;ame con&s;umption would ari&s;e; and that labour
which at pre&s;ent is employed only in producing a
&s;lender gratification to one man, would relieve the

The &s;ame care and toil that rai&s;e a di&s;h of pea&s;e

other defect in human nature, &s;uch as indolence,
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, inattention to others, for which luxury
in &s;ome mea&s;ure provides a remedy, as one poi&s;on

&s;en&s;e of his dependence before his eyes, and
never to forget his numberle&s;s wants and infirmi|ties.
The ancient &s;upported him&s;elf by magnani|mity,
oftentation, pride, and the idea of his own
&s;uperiority above his fellow creatures. The mo|dern
made con&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion of humility and
aba&s;ement, of the contempt and hatred of him|&s;elf,
and endeavoured to attain the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed vir|tues
as far as they are attainable. The au&s;terities

<P>THERE is very little ground, either from rea|&s;on

every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the
heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of
an univer&s;al deluge, or general convul&s;ion of

of this fabric of the world, and its pa&s;&s;age, by
corruption or di&s;&s;olution, from one &s;tate or order
to another. It mu&s;t, therefore, as well as each
individual form which it contains, have its in|fancy,
youth, manhood, and old age; and it is
probable that, in all the&s;e variations, man, equally
with every animal and vegetable, will partake.
In the flouri&s;hing age of the world, it may be ex|pected
that the human &s;pecies &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s greater
vigour, both of mind and body, more pro&s;perous

are too &s;low to be di&s;cernible in that &s;hort period

Stature and force of body, length of life, even

though they univer&s;ally decayed in one age, yet

though it were allowed that the univer&s;e, like an

by what magic, what chicane of law, is it now
annihilated, and rendered of no validity? The&s;e

authority. It was not con&s;idered that the
pre&s;ent difficulty, or &s;eeming ab&s;urdity, had pro|ceeded
from late innovations introduced into the
government. Ever &s;ince the beginning of this
century, the parliament had, with the mo&s;t lau|dable
zeal, been acquiring powers, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
principles, favourable to law and liberty; the
authority of the crown had been limited in many
important particulars; and penal &s;tatutes were
often calculated to &s;ecure the con&s;titution again&s;t
the attempts of mini&s;ters, as well as to pre&s;erve
general peace, and repre&s;s crimes and immorali|ties.
A prerogative, however, derived from very
ancient and almo&s;t uniform practice, the di&s;pen|&s;ing
power, &s;till remained, or was &s;uppo&s;ed to re|main,
with the crown, &s;ufficient in an in&s;tant to
overturn this whole fabric, and to throw down all

which carries on the face of it &s;uch &s;trong &s;ym|ptoms
of an ab&s;olute authority in the crown, had
yet, in ancient times, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome degree
of liberty in the &s;ubject, this fact only proves, that
&s;carce any human government, much le&s;s one erect|ed
in rude and barbarous times, is entirely con|&s;i&s;tent
and uniform in all its parts. But to expect
that the di&s;pen&s;ing power could in any degree be
rendered compatible with tho&s;e accurate and re|gular
limitations which had of late been e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,

<P>IF ever, on any occa&s;ion, it were laudable to

that the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance affords &s;uch
an example, and that all &s;peculative rea&s;oners
ought to ob&s;erve, with regard to this principle,
the &s;ame cautious &s;ilence which the laws, in every
&s;pecies of government, have ever pre&s;cribed to
them&s;elves. Government is in&s;tituted, in order to
re&s;train the fury and inju&s;tice of the people; and
being always founded on opinion, not on force,
it is dangerous to weaken, by the&s;e &s;peculations,
the reverence which the multitude owe to autho|rity,
and to in&s;truct them before-hand, that the
ca&s;e can ever happen, when they may be freed
from their duty of allegiance. Or, &s;hould it be
found impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train the licence of human
di&s;qui&s;itions, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the
doctrine of obedience ought alone to be inculcated;

that mankind, by this prudent re&s;erve, &s;hould
univer&s;ally degenerate into a &s;tate of abject &s;ervi|tude.
Where the exception really occurs, even
though it be not previou&s;ly expected and de&s;canted
on, it mu&s;t from its very nature be &s;o obvious and
undi&s;puted, as to remove all doubt, and overpower
the re&s;traint, however great, impo&s;ed by teaching
the general doctrine of obedience. But between
<PB N="104" REF="135">
re&s;i&s;ting a prince and dethroning him, there is a
very wide interval; and the abu&s;es of power which
can warrant the latter violence, are much greater

&s;uppo&s;ition, though for the future it ought ever to
be little looked for, mu&s;t, by all candid enquirers,
be acknowledged in the pa&s;t. But between the
dethroning a prince, and puni&s;hing him, there is
another very wide interval; and it were not &s;trange,
if even men of the mo&s;t enlarged thought &s;hould
que&s;tion, whether human nature could ever, in any
monarch, reach that height of depravity, as to
warrant in revolted &s;ubjects this la&s;t act of extra|ordinary

to the per&s;ons of princes, is &s;o &s;alutary, that to
di&s;&s;ipate it by the formal trial and puni&s;hment of a

the people, than the example of ju&s;tice can be

<P>AS one kind of death may be preferable to an|other,
it may be enquired, whether it be more de|&s;irable
for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution to terminate in
a popular government, or in ab&s;olute monarchy?
Here I would frankly declare, that, though liberty
be preferable to &s;lavery, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, yet
I &s;hould rather wi&s;h to &s;ee an ab&s;olute monarchy
than a republic in this i&s;land: for, let us con&s;ider

The que&s;tion is not concerning any fine imaginary
republic, of which a man may form a plan in his
clo&s;et. There is no doubt, but a popular govern|ment
may be imagined more perfect than ab&s;olute
monarchy, or even than our pre&s;ent con&s;titution.
But what rea&s;on have we to expect that any &s;uch
government will ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Britain,</HI>
upon the di&s;&s;olution of our monarchy? If any
&s;ingle per&s;on acquire power enough to take our
con&s;titution to pieces, and put it up a-new, he is
really an ab&s;olute monarch; and we have already

or e&s;tabli&s;h any free government. Matters, there|fore,
mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to their natural progre&s;s and
operation; and the Hou&s;e of Commons, according
to its pre&s;ent con&s;titution, mu&s;t be the only legi&s;|lator
in &s;uch a popular government. The incon|veniences
attending &s;uch a &s;ituation of affairs pre|&s;ent
them&s;elves by thou&s;ands. If the Hou&s;e of
Commons, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, ever di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, which
is not to be expected, we may look for a civil war
every election. If it continue it&s;elf, we &s;hall &s;uffer
all the tyranny of a faction, &s;ubdivided into new
factions. And, as &s;uch violent government can|not

<P>THE period was now come when that enormous

&s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, together with peace and
civility, on &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the globe,
was approaching towards its final di&s;&s;olution.
<HI>Italy,</HI> and the centre of the empire, removed du|ring
&s;o many ages from all concern in the wars,
had entirely lo&s;t the military &s;pirit, and were peo|pled
by an enervated race, equally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ub|mit
to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their
<PB N="107" REF="138">
own rulers. The emperors found them&s;elves ob|liged
to recruit their legions from the frontier
provinces, where the genius of war, though lan|gui&s;hing,
was not totally extinct; and the&s;e mer|cenary
forces, carele&s;s of laws and civil in&s;titu|tions,
e&s;tabli&s;hed a military government, no le&s;s
dangerous to the &s;overeign than to the people.
The farther progre&s;s of the &s;ame di&s;orders intro|duced
the bordering barbarians into the &s;ervice of
the <HI>Romans;</HI> and tho&s;e fierce nations, having now
added di&s;cipline and &s;kill to their native bravery,
could no longer be re&s;trained by the impotent po|licy

the one in the de&s;truction of the other. Sen|&s;ible

in the reign of <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI> a&s;&s;ailed at
once all the frontiers of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire; and,
having fir&s;t &s;atiated their avidity by plunder, be|gan
to think of fixing a &s;ettlement in the wa&s;ted
provinces. The more di&s;tant barbarians, who oc|cupied

in their acqui&s;itions, and pre&s;&s;ed with their
incumbent weight the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tate, already un|equal
to the load which it &s;u&s;tained. In&s;tead of
arming the people in their own defence, the em|perors
recalled all the di&s;tant legions, in whom
alone they could repo&s;e confidence, and collected
the whole military force for the defence of the ca|pital
and centre of the empire. The nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation had &s;uper&s;eded the ambition of

<HEAD>LORD FALKLAND.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE a&s;&s;embling the pre&s;ent parliament,
this man, devoted to the pur&s;uits of learning, and
to the &s;ociety of all the polite and elegant, had
enjoyed him&s;elf in every plea&s;ure which a fine ge|nius,
a generous di&s;po&s;ition, and an opulent for|tune,
could afford. Called into public life, he
&s;tood foremo&s;t in all attacks on the exorbitant pre|rogative
of the crown; and di&s;played that ma&s;cu|line
eloquence, and undaunted love of liberty,
which, from his intimate acquaintance with the
&s;ublime &s;pirits of antiquity, he had greedily im|bibed.
When civil convul&s;ions proceeded to ex|tremity,
and it became requi&s;ite for him to chu&s;e
his &s;ide, he tempered the ardour of his zeal, and
embraced the defence of tho&s;e limited powers which
remained to monarchy, and which he deemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the &s;upport of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution.
Still anxious, however, for his country, he &s;eems
to have dreaded the too pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s of his
own party as much as of the enemy; and, among
his intimate friends, often, after a deep &s;ilence,
and frequent &s;ighs, he would with a &s;ad accent
reiterate the word <HI>peace.</HI> In excu&s;e for the too
free expo&s;ing of his per&s;on, which &s;eemed un&s;uit|able
in a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, he alledged that it
<PB N="114" REF="145">
became him to be more active than other men in
all hazardous enterpri&s;es, le&s;t his impatience for
peace might bear the imputation of cowardice or
pu&s;illanimity. From the commencement of the
war, his natural chearfulne&s;s and vivacity became
clouded; and even his u&s;ual attention to dre&s;s,
required by his birth or &s;tation, gave way to a
negligence which was ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable. On the
morning of the battle in which he fell, he had
&s;hewn &s;ome care for the adorning his per&s;on; and
gave for a rea&s;on, that the enemy &s;hould not find
his body in any &s;lovenly, indecent &s;ituation. "I
am weary," &s;ubjoined he, "of the times, and
fore&s;ee much mi&s;ery to my country; but be|lieve
that I &s;hall be out of it are night."</P>

<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and

of a &s;age, or wi&s;e man, the philo&s;ophers
have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction

it reduced to practice: &s;o happily were all his vir|tues
tempered together, &s;o ju&s;tly were they blend|ed,
and &s;o powerfully did each prevent the other
from exceeding its proper bounds! He knew how
<PB N="115" REF="146">
to conciliate the bolde&s;t enterpri&s;e with the coole&s;t

<HEAD>THE IRISH MASSACRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> every where intermingled with the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> needed but a hint from their leaders and
prie&s;ts to begin ho&s;tilities again&s;t a people, whom
they hated on account of their religion, and envied
for their riches and pro&s;perity. The hou&s;es, cattle,
<PB N="116" REF="147">
goods, of the unwary <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were fir&s;t &s;eized. Tho&s;e
who heard of the commotion in their neighbourhood,
in&s;tead of de&s;erting their habitations, and flocking
together for mutual protection, remained at home in
hopes of defending their property, and fell thus
&s;eparately into the hands of their enemies. After
rapacity had fully exerted it&s;elf, cruelty, and the
mo&s;t barbarous that ever, in any nation, was known,
or heard of, began its operations. An univer&s;al
ma&s;&s;acre commenced of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> now defence|le&s;s,
and pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned to their inhuman foes.
No age, no &s;ex, no condition, was &s;pared. The
wi&s;e, weeping for her butchered hu&s;band, and em|bracing
her helple&s;s children, was pierced with
them, and peri&s;hed by the &s;ame &s;troke. The old,
the young, the vigorous, the infirm, underwent
a like fate, and were confounded in one common
ruin. In vain did flight &s;ave from the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault;
De&s;truction was, every where, let loo&s;e, and met
the hunted victims at every turn. In vain was re|cour&s;e
had to relations, to companions, to friends.
All connection was di&s;&s;olved; and death was dealt
by that hand, from which protection was implored
and expected. Without provocation, without op|po&s;ition,
the a&s;toni&s;hed <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> living in profound
peace and full &s;ecurity, were ma&s;&s;acred by their
neare&s;t neighbours, with whom they had long up|held
a continued intercour&s;e of kindne&s;s and good
offices.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="148">
But death was the lighte&s;t puni&s;hment inflicted
by tho&s;e more than barbarous &s;avages: all the
tortures which wanton cruelty could devi&s;e, all
the lingering pains of body, the angui&s;h of mind,
the agonies of de&s;pair, could not &s;atiate revenge
exacted without injury, and cruelty derived from
no cau&s;e. To enter into particulars, would &s;hock
the lea&s;t delicate humanity. Such enormities,
though atte&s;ted by undoubted evidence, appear al|mo&s;t
incredible. Depraved nature, even perverted
religion, though encouraged by the utmo&s;t licence,
reach not to &s;uch a pitch of ferocity; unle&s;s the
pity inherent in human brea&s;ts, by that contagion
of example, which tran&s;ports men beyond all the
u&s;ual motives of conduct and behaviour, be anni|hilated.</P>
<P>The weaker &s;ex them&s;elves, naturally tender to
their own &s;ufferings, and compa&s;&s;ionate to tho&s;e of
others, here emulated their more robu&s;t compa|nions
in the practice of every cruelty. Even chil|dren,
taught by the example, and encouraged by
the exhortation, of their parents, a&s;&s;ayed their
feeble blows on the dead carca&s;es or defencele&s;s
children of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The very avarice of the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> was not a &s;ufficient re&s;traint to their cruelty.
Such was their frenzy, that the cattle which they
had &s;eized, and by rapine had made their own,
yet, becau&s;e they bore the name of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> were
wantonly &s;laughtered, or, when covered with
wounds, turned loo&s;e into the woods and de&s;erts.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="149">
The &s;tately buildings or commodious habitations
of the planters, as if upbraiding the &s;loth and
ignorance of the natives, were con&s;umed with &s;ire,
or laid level with the ground. And where the
mi&s;erable owners, &s;hut up in their hou&s;es, and
preparing for defence, peri&s;hed in the flames, to|gether
with their wives and children, a double
triumph was afforded to the&s;e in&s;ulting butchers.</P>
<P>If any where a number a&s;&s;embled together, and,
a&s;&s;uming courage from de&s;pair, were re&s;olved to
&s;weeten death by a revenge of their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; they
were di&s;armed by capitulations, and promi&s;es of
&s;afety, confirmed by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths; but
no &s;ooner had they &s;urrendered, than the rebels,
with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> equal to their cruelty, made them
&s;hare the fate of their unhappy countrymen.</P>
<P>Others, more ingenious &s;till in their barbarity,
tempted their pri&s;oners, by the fond love of life,
to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends, bro|thers,
parents; and, having thus rendered them
accomplices in their guilt, gave them that death
which they &s;ought to &s;hun by de&s;erving it.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e enormities, the &s;acred name of
religion re&s;ounded on every &s;ide, not to &s;top the
hands of the&s;e &s;avages, but to enforce their blows,
and to &s;teel their hearts again&s;t every movement of
human or &s;ocial &s;ympathy. The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as here|tics,
abhorred of God, and dete&s;table to all holy
<PB N="119" REF="150">
men, were marked out by the prie&s;ts for &s;laughter;
and of all actions, to rid the world of the&s;e de|clared
enemies to Catholic faith and piety, was
repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t meritorious. Nature,
which, in that rude people, was &s;ufficiently in|clined
to atrocious deeds, was farther &s;timulated
by precept; and national prejudices impoi&s;oned
by tho&s;e aver&s;ions, more deadly and incurable,
which aro&s;e from an enraged &s;uper&s;tition. While
death fini&s;hed the &s;ufferings of each victim, the
bigoted a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, with joy and exultation, &s;till
echoed in his expiring ears, that the&s;e agonies
were but the commencement of torments infinite
and eternal.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> the flames of rebellion diffu&s;ed
them&s;elves, in an in&s;tant, over the other three
provinces of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In all places, death and
&s;laughter were not uncommon; though the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI>
in the&s;e other provinces, pretended to act with
more moderation and humanity: but cruel and
barbarous was their humanity! Not contented with
expelling the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> their hou&s;es, with de&s;poiling
them of their goodly manors, with wa&s;ting their
cultivated fields, they &s;tripped them of their very
clothes, and turned them out, naked and defence|le&s;s,
to all the &s;everities of the &s;ea&s;on. The hea|vens
them&s;elves, as if con&s;piring again&s;t that un|happy
people, were armed with cold and tempe&s;t,
unu&s;ual to the climate, and executed what the
mercile&s;s &s;word of the barbarians had left un|fini&s;hed.
<PB N="120" REF="151">
The roads were covered with crouds of
naked <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> ha&s;tening towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the
other cities which yet remained in the hands of
their countrymen. The feeble age of children,
the tender &s;ex of women, &s;oon &s;unk under the
multiplied rigours of cold and hunger. Here, the
hu&s;band, bidding a final adieu to his expiring fa|mily,
envied them that fate which he him&s;elf ex|pected
&s;o &s;oon to &s;hare: there, the &s;on, having
long &s;upported his aged parent, with reluctance
obeyed his la&s;t commands, and, abandoning him
in this uttermo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, re&s;erved him&s;elf to the
hopes of avenging that death, which all his efforts
could not prevent nor delay. The a&s;toni&s;hing
greatne&s;s of the calamity deprived the &s;ufferers of
any relief from the view of companions in afflic|tion.
With &s;ilent tears, or lamentable cries, they
hurried on through the ho&s;tile territories; and
found every heart, which was not &s;teeled by native
barbarity, guarded by the more implacable furies
of mi&s;taken piety and religion.</P>
<P>The &s;aving of <HI>Dublin</HI> pre&s;erved in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
remains of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> name. The gates of that
city, though timorou&s;ly opened, received the
wretched &s;upplicants, and di&s;covered to the view
a &s;cene of human mi&s;ery beyond what any eye had
ever before beheld. Compa&s;&s;ion &s;eized the amazed
inhabitants, aggravated with the fear of like cala|mities;
while they ob&s;erved the numerous foes,
without and within, which every where environed

them, and reflected on the weak re&s;ources by which
they were them&s;elves &s;upported. The more vigo|rous
of the unhappy fugitives, to the number of
three thou&s;and, were inli&s;ted into three regiments:
the re&s;t were di&s;tributed into the hou&s;es; and all
care was taken, by diet and warmth, to recruit
their feeble and torpid limbs. Di&s;ea&s;es of unknown
name and &s;pecies, derived from the&s;e multiplied
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;eized many of them, and put a &s;peedy
period to their lives: others, having no lei&s;ure to
reflect on their mighty lo&s;s of friends and fortune,
cur&s;ed that being which they had &s;aved. Aban|doning
them&s;elves to de&s;pair, refu&s;ing all &s;uccour,
they expired; without other con&s;olation, than that
of receiving among their countrymen the honours
of a grave, which to their &s;laughtered companions

<P>ON the origin of letters among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the

<PB N="122" REF="153">
which, whatever rudene&s;s may &s;ometimes at|tend
it, is &s;o fitted to expre&s;s the genuine move|ments
of nature and pa&s;&s;ion, that the compo&s;itions
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it mu&s;t for ever appear valuable to the
di&s;cerning part of mankind. The glaring figures
of di&s;cour&s;e, the pointed antithe&s;is, the unnatural
conceit, the jingle of words; &s;uch fal&s;e ornaments
were not employed by early writers, not becau&s;e
they were rejected, but becau&s;e they &s;carce ever
occurred to them. An ea&s;y unforced &s;train of
&s;entiment runs through their compo&s;itions; though
at the &s;ame time, amid&s;t the mo&s;t elegant &s;impli|city
of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, one is &s;ometimes
&s;urpri&s;ed to meet with a poor conceit, which had
pre&s;ented it&s;elf un&s;ought for, and which the au|thor
had not acquired critical ob&s;ervation enough
to condemn. A bad ta&s;te &s;eizes with avidity the&s;e
frivolous beauties, and even perhaps a good ta&s;te,
ere &s;urfeited by them. They multiply every day
more and more in the fa&s;hionable compo&s;itions:
nature and good-&s;en&s;e are neglected; laboured or|naments
&s;tudied and admired; and a total degene|racy
of &s;tyle and language prepares the way for
barbari&s;m and ignorance. Hence the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> man|ner
was found to depart &s;o much from the &s;imple
purity of <HI>Athens:</HI> hence that tin&s;el eloquence,
which is ob&s;ervable in many of the <HI>Roman</HI> writers;
from which <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf is not wholly exempted,

Nervous and picture&s;que expre&s;&s;ions, as well as de|&s;criptions,

affects the &s;pectator rather than the reader, we can

way, only by intervals, to the irradiation of ge|nius.

<HEAD>BACON AND GALILEO.</HEAD>
<P>THE great glory of literature in this i&s;land
during the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. was my Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI>
Mo&s;t of his performances were compo&s;ed in <HI>Latin,</HI>
though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the elegance of that,
nor of his native tongue. If we con&s;ider the va|riety
of talents employed by this man, as a public
&s;peaker, a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, a wit, a courtier, a
companion, an author, a philo&s;opher, he is ju&s;tly
the object of great admiration: if we con&s;ider him
merely as an author and philo&s;opher, the light in
which we view him at pre&s;ent, though very e&s;ti|mable,
he was yet inferior to his cotemporary
<HI>Galileo,</HI> perhaps even to <HI>Kepler. Bacon</HI> pointed
out at a di&s;tance the road to true philo&s;ophy: <HI>Ga|lileo</HI>
both pointed it out to others, and made him|&s;elf
con&s;iderable advances in it. The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>
was ignorant of geometry: the <HI>Florentine</HI> revived
that &s;cience, excelled in it, and was the fir&s;t who
applied it, together with experiment, to natural
philo&s;ophy. The former rejected, with the mo&s;t

fortified it with new proofs, derived both from
rea&s;on and the &s;en&s;es. <HI>Bacon</HI>'s &s;tyle is &s;tiff and

unnatural and far-fetched; and he &s;eems to

<HEAD>HENRY I. OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince was one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
that has filled the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> throne, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all
the qualities, both of body and mind, natural and
acquired, which could &s;it him for the high &s;tation
to which he attained. His per&s;on was manly, his
countenance engaging, his eyes clear, &s;erene, and
penetrating. The affability of his addre&s;s encou|raged
tho&s;e who might be over-awed by the &s;en&s;e
of his dignity, or of his wi&s;dom; and though he
often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how
to temper it with di&s;cretion, and ever kept at a
di&s;tance from all indecent familiarities with his
courtiers. His &s;uperior eloquence and judgment
would have given him an a&s;cendant, even had he
been born in a private &s;tation; and his per&s;onal
bravery would have procured him re&s;pect, even
though it had been le&s;s &s;upported by art and po|licy.
By his great progre&s;s in literature, he ac|quired
<PB N="128" REF="159">
the name of <HI>Beau-clerc,</HI> or the Scholar; but
his application to the&s;e &s;edentary pur&s;uits abated
nothing of the activity and vigilance of his go|vernment;
and though the learning of that age
was better fitted to corrupt than improve the un|der&s;tanding,
his natural good-&s;en&s;e pre&s;erved it&s;elf
untainted, both from the pedantry and &s;uper&s;tition
which were then &s;o prevalent among men of let|ters.
His temper was very &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;en|timents
as well of friend&s;hip as of re&s;entment;
and his ambition, though high, might be e&s;teemed
moderate and rea&s;onable, had not his conduct to|wards
his brother and nephew &s;hewed that he was
too much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice to it all the maxims
of ju&s;tice and equity. But the total incapacity of
<HI>Robert</HI> for government afforded his younger brother
a rea&s;on or pretence for &s;eizing the &s;ceptre both of
<HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> and when violence and

&s;ublime of any poet, in any language; <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>

how precarious all reputations founded on rea&s;on|ing

paints the manners of the age, and expo&s;es a faith|ful

<HI>Hobbes</HI>'s politics are fitted only to pro|mote

Though an enemy to religion, he par|takes
nothing of the &s;pirit of &s;ceptici&s;m; but is

into which this nation is divided, has reared up a
fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and
cover that &s;cheme of actions which it pur&s;ues.
The people being commonly very rude builders,

to imagine, that their workman&s;hip mu&s;t be

that violence and hurry in which it was rai&s;ed.
The one party, by tracing up government to the
Deity, endeavour to render it &s;o &s;acred and invio|late,
that it mu&s;t be little le&s;s than &s;acrilege, how|ever
tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade
it in the &s;malle&s;t article. The other party, by
founding government altogether on the con&s;ent of

<HEAD>THE TEMPLARS MASSACRED IN
FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE order of Knights <HI>Templars</HI> had ri&s;en
during the fir&s;t &s;ervour of the Cru&s;ades; and,
uniting the two qualities the mo&s;t popular in that
age, devotion and valour, and exerci&s;ing both in
the mo&s;t popular of all enterpri&s;es, the defence of
the Holy Land, they had made rapid advances to
credit and authority, and had acquired, from the
piety of the faithful, very ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in
every country in <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>France.</HI>
Their great riches, joined to the cour&s;e of time,
had, by degrees, relaxed the &s;everity of the&s;e vir|tues;
and the <HI>Templars,</HI> in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t
that popularity which fir&s;t rai&s;ed them to honour
and di&s;tinction. Acquainted, by experience, with
the fatigues and dangers of tho&s;e fruitle&s;s expedi|tions
to the Ea&s;t, they cho&s;e rather to enjoy in
ea&s;e their opulent revenues in <HI>Europe;</HI> and being
all of them men of birth, educated, according to
the cu&s;tom of the age, without any tincture of let|ters,
they &s;corned the ignoble occupations of a
<PB N="134" REF="165">
mona&s;tic life, and pa&s;&s;ed their time wholly in the
fa&s;hionable amu&s;ements of hunting, gallantry, and
the plea&s;ures of the table. Their rival order, that
of St. <HI>John of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who&s;e poverty had as
yet pre&s;erved them from like corruption, &s;till di|&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their enterpri&s;es again&s;t
the infidels, and &s;ucceeded to all the popularity
which was lo&s;t by the indolence and luxury of the
<HI>Templars.</HI> But though the&s;e cau&s;es had weakened
the foundation of this order, once &s;o celebrated
and revered, the immediate &s;ource of their de&s;truc|tion
proceeded from the cruel and vindictive &s;pirit
of <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> who, having entertained a pri|vate
di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t &s;ome eminent <HI>Templars,</HI> deter|mined
to gratify at once his avidity and revenge,
by involving the whole order in one undi&s;tingui&s;hed
ruin. On no better information, than that of two
Knights, condemned by their &s;uperiors to perpe|tual
impri&s;onment, for their vices and pro&s;ligacy,
he ordered, on one day, all the <HI>Templars</HI> of <HI>France</HI>
to be committed to pri&s;on, and imputed to them
&s;uch enormous and ab&s;urd crimes, as are &s;ufficient
of them&s;elves to de&s;troy all the credit of the accu|&s;ation.
Be&s;ides their being univer&s;ally charged
with murder, robbery, and vices the mo&s;t &s;hocking
to nature; every one, it was pretended, whom
they received into their order, was obliged to re|nounce
our Saviour, to &s;pit upon the cro&s;s, and
to join to this impiety the &s;uper&s;tition of wor&s;hip|ping
a gilded head, which was &s;ecretly kept in
one of their hou&s;es at <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> They al&s;o ini|tiated,
<PB N="135" REF="166">
it was &s;aid, every candidate, by &s;uch infa|mous
rites, as could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e,
than to degrade the order in his eyes, and de&s;troy
for ever the authority of all his &s;uperiors over him.
Above an hundred of the&s;e unhappy gentlemen
were put to the torture, in order to extort from
them a confe&s;&s;ion of their guilt: the more ob&s;ti|nate
peri&s;hed in the hands of their tormentors:
&s;everal, to procure them&s;elves immediate ea&s;e in
the violence of their agonies, acknowledged what|ever
was required of them: forged confe&s;&s;ions were
imputed to others: and <HI>Philip,</HI> as if their guilt
were now certain, proceeded to a confi&s;cation of
all their trea&s;ures. But no &s;ooner had the <HI>Templars</HI>
recovered from their tortures, than, preferring the
mo&s;t cruel execution to a life with infamy, they
di&s;avowed their confe&s;&s;ions, exclaimed again&s;t the
forgeries, ju&s;tified the innocence of their order,
and appealed to all the gallant actions performed
by them, in ancient or latter times, as a full apo|logy
for their conduct. The barbarous tyrant,
enraged at this di&s;appointment, and thinking him|&s;elf
now engaged in honour to proceed to extremi|ties,
ordered fifty-four of them, whom he branded
as relap&s;ed heretics, to peri&s;h by the puni&s;hment
of fire, in his capital: great numbers expired after
a like manner in other parts of the kingdom: and
when he found that the per&s;everance of the&s;e un|happy
victims, in ju&s;tifying to the la&s;t their inno|cence,
had made deep impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pectators,
he endeavoured to overcome the con&s;tancy of the
<PB N="136" REF="167">
<HI>Templars</HI> by new inhumanities. The Grand Ma&s;|ter
of the order, <HI>John de Molay,</HI> and another great
officer, brother to the &s;overeign of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;,</HI> were
conducted to a &s;caffold, erected before the church
of <HI>Notre Dame,</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> a full pardon was offered
them on the one hand: the fire, de&s;tined for their
execution, was &s;hewn to them on the other: the&s;e
gallant nobles &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the prote&s;tation of
their own innocence, and that of their order; and
were in&s;tantly hurried into the flames by the exe|cutioner.</P>
<P>In all this barbarous inju&s;tice, <HI>Clement</HI> V. who
was the creature of <HI>Philip,</HI> and then re&s;ided in
<HI>France,</HI> fully concurred; and, without examining
a witne&s;s, or making any enquiry into the truth
of facts, he &s;ummarily, by the plenitude of his
apo&s;tolic power, aboli&s;hed the whole order. The
<HI>Templars,</HI> all over <HI>Europe,</HI> were thrown into pri|&s;on;
their conduct underwent a &s;trict &s;crutiny;
the power of their enemies &s;till pur&s;ued and op|pre&s;&s;ed
them; but no where, except in <HI>France,</HI> were
the &s;malle&s;t traces of their guilt pretended to be
found. <HI>England</HI> &s;ent back an ample te&s;timony of
their piety and morals; but as the order was now
annihilated, the Knights were di&s;tributed into &s;eve|ral
convents, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were, by com|mand

Ob&s;erving their feet to &s;hake, in the ago|nies

mu&s;ic to their dancing; and he immediately com|manded
the drums to beat, and the trumpets to
&s;ound. By way of experiment, he ordered one
man to be hung up three times, que&s;tioning him,
at every interval, whether he repented of his
crime? But the man ob&s;tinately a&s;&s;erting, that,
notwith&s;tanding all the pa&s;t, he would &s;till will|ingly

to be hung in chains. One &s;tory commonly told

barbarity, which attended it. A young maid
pleaded for the life of her brother, and flung her|&s;elf
at <HI>Kirk</HI>'s feet, armed with all the charms
which beauty and innocence, bathed in tears,
could be&s;tow upon her. The tyrant was inflamed
with de&s;ire, not &s;oftened into love or clemency.
<PB N="138" REF="169">
He promi&s;ed to grant her reque&s;t, provided that
&s;he, in her turn, would be equally compliant to

his own regiment, in&s;tructed by his example, and
encouraged by his exhortations, di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves

<P>WHEN he was carried before the Parliament,

in a violent declamation, reproached him with the
breach of the national covenant, which he had
&s;ub&s;cribed; his rebellion again&s;t God, the King,

trea&s;ons, and impieties, for which he was now to
be brought to condign puni&s;hment. <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> in

as well as by the con&s;cience of a good cau&s;e,

<HEAD>He is &s;entenced.</HEAD>
<P>The clergy, hoping that the terrors of immediate

his fallen fortunes. They pronounced his damna|tion,
and a&s;&s;ured him, that the judgment, which
he was &s;o &s;oon to &s;uffer, would prove but an ea&s;y
prologue to that which he mu&s;t undergo hereafter.
They next offered to pray with him: but he was
too well acquainted with tho&s;e forms of impreca|tion,
<PB N="142" REF="173">
which they called prayers. He told them,
that they were a mi&s;erable, deluded, and deluding
people; end would &s;hortly briny their country
under the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;ervitude to which
any nation had ever been reduced. "For my
part," added he, "I am much prouder to have
my head affixed to the place where it is &s;en|tenced
to &s;tand, than to have my picture hang
in the King's bed-chamber. So far from being
&s;orry that my legs and arms are to be &s;ent to

enough to be di&s;per&s;ed into all the cities of

&s;entiment, that very evening, while in pri&s;on, he

<HEAD>His Execution.</HEAD>
<P>Now was led forth, amid&s;t the in&s;ults of ene|mies,

Every attempt which the in&s;olence of the

yet one effort more in this la&s;t and melancholy
&s;cene, when all enmity, ari&s;ing from motives merely

<HI>Montro&s;e</HI> &s;miled at this new in&s;tance of their malice.
He thanked them, however, for their officious
zeal, and &s;aid, that he bore this te&s;timony of his

The &s;iner arts, too, in his youth, he had &s;ucce&s;s|fully

which it belongs to virtue alone, and moderation,

The a&s;pect of &s;trangers was unea&s;y to him. With

and, entering the city &s;word in hand, exerci&s;ed all
tho&s;e brutalities which may be expected from fero|city
excited by re&s;i&s;tance, and in&s;olence which
takes place when that re&s;i&s;tance is no more. This
renowned city, expo&s;ed, by her renown alone, to
&s;o many calamities, never endured in any age,
even from the barbarians by whom &s;he was often

<HEAD>IMPUDENCE AND MODESTY,
AN ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JUPITER,</HI> in the beginning, joined Virtue,
Wi&s;dom, and Confidence together; and Vice,
Folly, and Diffidence: and in that &s;ociety &s;et
them upon the earth. But though he thought he
had matched them with great judgment, and &s;aid
that Confidence was the natural companion of
Virtue, and that Vice de&s;erved to be attended
with Diffidence, they had not gone far before di&s;|&s;en&s;ion
aro&s;e among them. Wi&s;dom, who was
the guide of the one company, was always accu&s;|tomed,
before &s;he ventured upon any road, how|ever
beaten, to examine it carefully, to enquire
whither it led, what dangers, difficulties, and hin|drances
might po&s;&s;ibly or probably occur in it.
In the&s;e deliberations &s;he u&s;ually con&s;umed &s;ome
time; which delay was very di&s;plea&s;ing to Confi|dence,
who was always inclined to hurry on, with|out
much forethought or deliberation, in the fir&s;t
road he met. Wi&s;dom and Virtue were in&s;epara|ble;
but Confidence one day, following his impe|tuous
<PB N="148" REF="181">
nature, advanced a con&s;iderable way before
his guides and companions; and, not feeling any
want of their company, he never enquired after
them, nor ever met with them more. In like
manner, the other &s;ociety, though joined by <HI>Ju|piter,</HI>
di&s;agreed and &s;eparated. As Folly &s;aw very
little way before her, &s;he had nothing to de|termine
concerning the goodne&s;s of roads, nor
could give the preference to one above another;
and this want of re&s;olution was increa&s;ed by Diffi|dence,
who, with her doubts and &s;cruples, always
retarded the journey. This was a great annoy|ance
to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties
and delays, and was never &s;atisfied without his full
career, in whatever his inclinations led him to.
Folly, he knew, though &s;he hearkened to Diffi|dence,
would be ea&s;ily managed when alone; and
therefore, as a vicious hor&s;e throws his rider, he
openly beat away this controller of all his plea|&s;ures,
and proceeded in his journey with Folly,
from whom he is in&s;eparable. Confidence and
Diffidence being, after this manner, both thrown
loo&s;e from their re&s;pective companies, wandered
for &s;ome time, till at la&s;t chance led them at the
&s;ame time to one village. Confidence went di|rectly
up to the great hou&s;e, which belonged to
Wealth, the lord of the village; and, without
&s;taying for a porter, intruded him&s;elf immediately
into the innermo&s;t apartments, where he found
Vice and Folly well received before him. He
joined the train, recommended him&s;elf very quick|ly
<PB N="149" REF="182">
to his landlord, and entered into &s;uch familia|rity
with Vice, that he was enli&s;ted in the &s;ame
company along with Folly. They were frequent
gue&s;ts of Wealth, and from that moment in&s;epa|rable.
Diffidence, in the mean time, not daring
to approach the great hou&s;e, accepted of an invi|tation
from Poverty, one of the tenants; and, en|tering
the cottage, found Wi&s;dom and Virtue,
who, being repul&s;ed by the landlord, had retired
thither. Virtue took compa&s;&s;ion of her, and Wi&s;|dom
found, from her temper, that &s;he would ea|&s;ily
improve: &s;o they admitted her into their &s;o|ciety.
Accordingly, by their means, &s;he altered
in a little time &s;omewhat of her manner, and be|coming
much more amiable and engaging, was
now called by the name of Mode&s;ty. As ill com|pany
has a greater effect than good, Confidence,
though more refractory to coun&s;el and example,
degenerated &s;o far by the &s;ociety of Vice and Fol|ly,
as to pa&s;s by the name of Impudence. Man|kind,
who &s;aw the&s;e &s;ocieties as <HI>Jupiter</HI> fir&s;t joined
them, and know nothing of the&s;e mutual de&s;er|tions,
are led into &s;trange mi&s;takes by tho&s;e,

<HEAD>OF THE STUDY OF HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing I would recommend more
earne&s;tly to my female readers than the Study of
Hi&s;tory, as an occupation, of all others, the be&s;t
&s;uited both to their &s;ex and education; much more
in&s;tructive than their ordinary books of amu&s;e|ment,
and more entertaining than tho&s;e &s;erious
compo&s;itions which are u&s;ually to be found in
their clo&s;ets. Among other important truths,
which they may learn from hi&s;tory, they may be
informed of two particulars, the knowledge of
which may contribute very much to their quiet
and repo&s;e; That our &s;ex, as well as theirs, are
far from being &s;uch perfect creatures as they are
apt to imagine; and, That Love is not the only
pa&s;&s;ion that governs the male world, but is often
overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity, and a
thou&s;and other pa&s;&s;ions. Whether they be the
fal&s;e repre&s;entations of mankind in tho&s;e two par|ticulars
that endear romances and novels &s;o much
so the fair &s;ex, I know not; but mu&s;t confe&s;s, I
am &s;orry to &s;ee them have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to
matter of fact, and &s;uch an appetite for fal&s;ehood.
I remember I was once de&s;ired by a young beauty,
for whom I had &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;end her &s;ome
novels and romances for her amu&s;ement in the
country; but was not &s;o ungenerous as to take
the advantage which &s;uch a cour&s;e of reading
might have given me, being re&s;olved not to make
<PB N="151" REF="184">
u&s;e of poi&s;oned arms again&s;t her. I therefore &s;ent
her <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives, a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame
time, that there was not a word of truth in them
from beginning to end. She peru&s;ed them very
attentively till &s;he came to the Lives of <HI>Alexander</HI>
and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e names &s;he had heard of by acci|dent;
and then returned me the book, with many,
reproaches for deceiving her.</P>
<P>I may indeed be told, that the fair &s;ex have no
&s;uch aver&s;ion to hi&s;tory as I have repre&s;ented, pro|vided
it be <HI>&s;ecret</HI> hi&s;tory, and contain &s;ome memo|rable
tran&s;action proper to excite their curio&s;ity.
But as I do not find that truth, which is the ba&s;is
of hi&s;tory, is at all regarded in tho&s;e anecdotes,
I cannot admit of this as a proof of their pa&s;&s;ion
for that &s;tudy. However this may be, I &s;ee not
why the &s;ame curio&s;ity might not receive a more
proper direction, and lead them to de&s;ire accounts
of tho&s;e who lived in pa&s;t ages, as well as of their
contemporaries. What is it to <HI>Cleora,</HI> whether
<HI>Fulvia</HI> entertains a &s;ecret commerce of love with
<HI>Philander</HI> or not? Has &s;he not equal rea&s;on to be
plea&s;ed, when &s;he is informed, (what is whi&s;pered
about among hi&s;torians) that <HI>Cato</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter had an
intrigue with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and palmed her &s;on, <HI>Marcus
Brutus,</HI> upon her hu&s;band for his own, though in
reality he was her gallant's? And are not the
loves of <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> or <HI>Julia</HI> as proper &s;ubjects of
di&s;cour&s;e as any intrigue that this city has pro|duced
of late years?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="185">
But I know not whence it comes that I have
been thus &s;educed into a kind of raillery again&s;t
the ladies; unle&s;s, perhaps, it proceed from the
&s;ame cau&s;e that makes the per&s;on who is the fa|vourite
of the company, be often the object of
their good-natured je&s;ts and plea&s;antries. We are
plea&s;ed to addre&s;s our&s;elves after any manner to a
per&s;on that is agreeable to us; and, at the &s;ame

one who is &s;ecure of the good opinion and affec|tions

handle my &s;ubject more &s;eriou&s;ly, and &s;hall point
out the many advantages that flow from the Study
of Hi&s;tory, and &s;how how well &s;uited it is to every
one, but particularly to tho&s;e who are debarred
the &s;everer &s;tudies, by the tenderne&s;s of their com|plexion,
and the weakne&s;s of their education.
The advantages found in hi&s;tory &s;eem to be of
three kinds, as it amu&s;es the fancy, as it improves
the under&s;tanding, and as it &s;trengthens virtue.</P>
<P>In reality, what more agreeable entertainment to
the mind, than to be tran&s;ported into the remote&s;t
ages of the world, and to ob&s;erve human &s;ociety,
in its infancy, making the fir&s;t faint e&s;&s;ays towards
the arts and &s;ciences? To &s;ee the policy of go|vernment
and the civility of conver&s;ation ref<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ning
by degrees, and every thing that is ornamental to
human life advancing towards its perfection? To
mark the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, declen&s;ion, and final ex|tinction
of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing empires; the vir|tues
<PB N="153" REF="186">
which contributed to their greatne&s;s, and the
vices which drew on their ruin? In &s;hort, to &s;ee
all human race, from the beginning of time, pa&s;s,
as it were, in review before us, appearing in their
true colours, without any of tho&s;e di&s;gui&s;es which,
during their life-time, &s;o much perplexed the
judgments of the beholders? What &s;pectacle can
be imagined &s;o magnificent, &s;o various, &s;o inte|re&s;ting?
What amu&s;ement, either of the &s;en&s;es or
imagination, can be compared with it? Shall
tho&s;e trifling pa&s;times, which engro&s;s &s;o much of
our time, be preferred as more &s;atisfactory, and
more &s;it to engage our attention? How perver&s;e
mu&s;t that ta&s;te be, which is capable of &s;o wrong a
choice of plea&s;ures!</P>
<P>But hi&s;tory is a mo&s;t improving part of know|ledge,
as well as an agreeable amu&s;ement; and in|deed
a great part of what we commonly call <HI>eru|dition,</HI>
and value &s;o highly, is nothing but an
acquaintance with hi&s;torical facts. An exten&s;ive
knowledge of this kind belongs to Men of Let|ters;
but I mu&s;t think it an unpardonable igno|rance
in per&s;ons, of whatever &s;ex or condition, not
to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of their own
country along with the hi&s;tories of ancient <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome.</HI> A woman may behave her&s;elf with
good-manners, and have even &s;ome vivacity in her
turn of wit; but, where her mind is &s;o unfurni&s;h|ed,
'tis impo&s;&s;ible her conver&s;ation can afford any
entertainment to men of &s;en&s;e and reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="187">
I mu&s;t add, that hi&s;tory is not only a valuable
part of knowledge, but opens the door to many
other parts of knowledge, and affords materials
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;ciences. And indeed, if we con|&s;ider
the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and our limited
knowledge, even of what pa&s;&s;es in our own time,
we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that we &s;hould be for ever chil|dren
in under&s;tanding, were it not for this inven|tion,
which extends our experience to all pa&s;t ages,
and to the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations; making them con|tribute
as much to our improvement in wi&s;dom as
if they had actually lain under our ob&s;ervation.
A man acquainted with hi&s;tory may, in &s;ome re|&s;pect,
be &s;aid to have lived from the beginning of
the world, and to have been making continual ad|ditions
to his &s;tock of knowledge in every cen|tury.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o an advantage in that knowledge
which is acquired by hi&s;tory, above what is learn|ed
by the practice of the world, that it brings us
acquainted with human affairs, without dimini&s;h|ing
in the lea&s;t from the mo&s;t delicate &s;enti|ments
of virtue. And, to tell the truth, I know
not any &s;tudy or occupation &s;o unexceptionable as
hi&s;tory in this particular. Poets can paint virtue
in the mo&s;t charming colours; but, as they addre&s;s
them&s;elves entirely to the pa&s;&s;ions, they often be|come
advocates for vice. Even philo&s;ophers are
apt to bewilder them&s;elves in the &s;ubtilty of their
&s;peculations; and we have &s;een &s;ome go &s;o far as
<PB N="155" REF="188">
to deny the reality of all moral di&s;tinctions. But
I think it a remark worthy the attention of the
&s;peculative reader, that the hi&s;torians have been,
almo&s;t without exception, the true friends of vir|tue,
and have always repre&s;ented it in its proper
colours, however they may have erred in their
judgments of particular per&s;ons. <HI>Machiavel</HI> him|&s;elf
di&s;covers a true &s;entiment of virtue in his Hi&s;|tory
of <HI>Florence.</HI> When he talks as a politician,
in his general rea&s;onings, he con&s;iders poi&s;oning,
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and perjury, as lawful arts of power;
but when he &s;peaks as an hi&s;torian, in his particu|lar
narrations, he &s;hows &s;o keen an indignation
again&s;t vice, and &s;o warm an approbation of vir|tue,
in many pa&s;&s;ages, that I could not forbear
applying to him that remark of <HI>Horace,</HI> That if
you cha&s;e away nature, though with never &s;o great

is this combination of hi&s;torians in favour of virtue
at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man
of bu&s;ine&s;s enters into life and action, he is more
apt to con&s;ider the characters of men as they have
relation to his intere&s;t than as they &s;tand in them|&s;elves,
and has his judgment warped on every oc|ca&s;ion

leaves the mind &s;o cold und unmoved that the

<P>OUR old mother Earth once laid an indictment
again&s;t Avarice before the courts of heaven, for
her wicked and malicious coun&s;el and advice, in
tempting, inducing, per&s;uading, and traiterou&s;ly
&s;educing the children of the plaintiff to commit
the dete&s;table crime of parricide upon her, and,
mangling her body, ran&s;ack her very bowels for
hidden trea&s;ure. The indictment was very long
and verbo&s;e; but we mu&s;t omit a great part of
the repetitions and &s;ynonymous terms, not to tire
our reader too much with our tale. Avarice, be|ing
called before <HI>Jupiter</HI> to an&s;wer to this charge,
had not much to &s;ay in her own defence. The
injury was clearly proved upon her. The fact,
indeed, was notorious, and the injury had been
frequently repeated. When therefore the plain|tiff
demanded ju&s;tice, <HI>Jupiter</HI> very readily gave
&s;entence in her favour; and his decree was to this
purpo&s;e, That &s;ince Dame Avarice, the defen|dant,

<HEAD>LOVE AND MARRIAGE. AN ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND were not, as at pre&s;ent, originally
divided into male and female; but each individual
was a compound of both &s;exes, and was in him&s;elf
both Hu&s;band and Wife, melted down into one
living creature. This union was doubtle&s;s very
entire, and the parts well adju&s;ted together, &s;ince
there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted the mo&s;t perfect harmony between
male and female, though obliged to continue in|&s;eparable
companions. But &s;o great was the hap|pine&s;s
flowing from this union, that the <HI>men-women</HI>
became in&s;olent on their pro&s;perity, and rebelled
again&s;t the gods. To puni&s;h them for this teme|rity,
<HI>Jupiter</HI> could contrive no better expedient,
than to divorce the male part from the female,
and make two imperfect beings of the compound,
which was before &s;o perfect. Hence the origin of
men and women, as di&s;tinct creatures. But, not|with&s;tanding
our divi&s;ion, &s;o lively is our remem|brance
of the happine&s;s enjoyed in our primaeval
&s;tate, that we are never at re&s;t in the pre&s;ent. Each
of the&s;e halves is continually &s;earching through
the whole &s;pecies to find the other half, which
was broken from it: and when they meet, they
join again with the greate&s;t fondne&s;s and &s;ympathy.
But it often happens, that they are mi&s;taken in
this particular; that they take for their half what
no way corre&s;ponds to them; and that the parts
do not meet nor join in with each other, as is u&s;ual
<PB N="159" REF="192">
with fractures. In this ca&s;e, the union is &s;oon,
di&s;&s;olved, and each part is &s;et loo&s;e again, to hunt
for its lo&s;t half; joining it&s;elf to every one it meets,
by way of trial, and enjoying no re&s;t, till its per|fect
&s;ympathy with its partner &s;hews that it has at
la&s;t been &s;ucce&s;sful in its endeavours.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jupiter</HI> had &s;eparated the male from the
female, and had quelled their pride and ambition
by &s;o &s;evere an operation, he could not but repent
him of the cruelty of his vengeance, and take
compa&s;&s;ion on poor mortals, who were now become
incapable of any repo&s;e or tranquillity. Such
cravings, &s;uch anxieties, &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities, aro&s;e,
as made them cur&s;e their creation, and think ex|i&s;tence
it&s;elf a puni&s;hment. In vain had they re|cour&s;e
to every other occupation and amu&s;ement.
In vain did they &s;eek after every plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e,
and every refinement of rea&s;on. Nothing could
fill that void, which they felt in their hearts, or
&s;upply the lo&s;s of their partner, who was &s;o fatally
&s;eparated from them. To remedy this di&s;order,
and to be&s;tow &s;ome comfort, at lea&s;t, on human
race in their forlorn &s;ituation, <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;ent down
<HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hymen</HI> to collect the broken halves of
human kind, and piece them together, in the be&s;t
manner po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e two deities found &s;uch a
prompt di&s;po&s;ition in mankind to unite again in
their primitive &s;tate, that they proceeded on their
work with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s for &s;ome time; till at
la&s;t, from many unlucky accidents, di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e

of <HI>Hymen</HI> was <HI>Care,</HI> who was continually filling his
patron's head with pro&s;pects of futurity; a &s;ettle|ment,
family, children, &s;ervants; &s;o that little el&s;e
was regarded in all the matches <HI>they</HI> made. On
the other hand, <HI>Love</HI> had cho&s;en <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> for his
favourite, who was as pernicious a coun&s;ellor as
the other, and would never allow <HI>Love</HI> to look be|yond
the pre&s;ent momentary gratification, or the
&s;atisfying of the prevailing inclination. The&s;e
two favourites became, in a little time, irrecon|cileable
enemies, and made it their chief bu&s;ine&s;s
to undermine each other in all their undertakings.
No &s;ooner had <HI>Love</HI> fixed upon two halves, which
he was cementing together, and forming to a clo&s;e
union, but <HI>Care</HI> in&s;inuates him&s;elf, and, bringing
<HI>Hymen</HI> along with him, di&s;&s;olves the union pro|duced

a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they under-hand contrive to join each
half, by &s;ecret links, to halves which <HI>Hymen</HI> was
wholly unacquainted with. It was not long before
this quarrel was felt in its pernicious con&s;equences;
arid &s;uch complaints aro&s;e before the throne of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> that he was obliged to &s;ummon the offend|ing
parties to appear before him, in order to give
an account of their proceedings. After hearing
the pleadings on both &s;ides, he ordered an imme|diate
reconcilement betwixt <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hymen,</HI> as the
<PB N="161" REF="194">
only expedient for giving happine&s;s to mankind:
and that he might be &s;ure this reconcilement &s;hould
be durable, he laid his &s;trict injunctions on them,
never to join any halves without con&s;ulting their
favourites, <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and obtaining the
con&s;ent of both to the conjunction. Where this

<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>Aug. 2, 1737.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW you are more curious of
accounts of men than of buildings, and are more
de&s;irous of being informed of private hi&s;tory than
of public tran&s;actions; for which rea&s;on, I thought
the following &s;tory, which is the common topic of
conver&s;ation in this city, would be no unacceptable
entertainment to you.</P>
<P>A young lady of birth and fortune, being left
entirely at her own di&s;po&s;al, per&s;i&s;ted long in a re|&s;olution
of leading a &s;ingle life, notwithstanding
&s;everal advantageous offers that had been made to
her. She had been determined to embrace this
re&s;olution, by ob&s;erving the many unhappy mar|riages
<PB N="162" REF="195">
among her acquaintance, and by hearing
the complaints which her female friends made of
the tyranny, incon&s;tancy, jealou&s;y, or indifference
of their hu&s;bands. Being a woman of &s;trong &s;pi|rit,
and an uncommon way of thinking, &s;he found
no difficulty either in forming or maintaining this
re&s;olution, and could not &s;u&s;pect her&s;elf of &s;uch
weakne&s;s, as ever to be induced, by any tempta|tion,
to depart from it. She had, however, en|tertained
a &s;trong de&s;ire of having a &s;on, who&s;e
education &s;he was re&s;olved to make the principal
concern of her life, and by that means &s;upply the
place of tho&s;e other pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;he was re|&s;olved
for ever to renounce. She pu&s;hed her phi|lo&s;ophy
to &s;uch an uncommon length, as to find
no contradiction betwixt &s;uch a de&s;ire and her
former re&s;olution; and accordingly looked about,
with great deliberation, to find, among all her
male acquaintance, one who&s;e character and per|&s;on
were agreeable to her, without being able to
&s;atisfy her&s;elf on that head. At length, being in
the play-hou&s;e one evening, &s;he &s;ees, in the <HI>par|terre,</HI>
a young man of a mo&s;t engaging countenance
and mode&s;t deportment; and feels &s;uch a pre-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
in his favour, that &s;he had hopes this mu&s;t
be the per&s;on &s;he had long &s;ought for in vain. She
immediately di&s;patches a &s;ervant to him; de&s;iring
his company, at her lodgings, next morning. The
young man was over-joyed at the me&s;&s;age, and
could not command his &s;atisfaction, upon receiv|ing
&s;uch an advance from a lady of &s;o great beau|ty,
<PB N="163" REF="196">
reputation, and quality. He was, therefore,
much di&s;appointed, when he found a woman who
would allow him no freedoms, and, amid&s;t all her
obliging behaviour, confined and over-awed him
to the bounds of rational di&s;cour&s;e and conver&s;a|tion.
She &s;eemed, however, willing to commence
a friend&s;hip with him; and told him, that his
company would always be acceptable to her, when|ever
he had a lei&s;ure hour to be&s;tow. He needed
not much intreaty to renew his vi&s;its; being &s;o
&s;truck with her wit and beauty, that he mu&s;t have
been unhappy, had he been debarred her company.
Every conver&s;ation &s;erved only the more to inflame
his pa&s;&s;ion, and gave him more occa&s;ion to admire
her per&s;on and under&s;tanding, as well as to rejoice
in his own good fortune. He was not, however,
without anxiety, when he con&s;idered the di&s;pro|portion
of their birth and fortune; nor was his
unea&s;ine&s;s allayed, even when he reflected on the
extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance
had commenced. Our philo&s;ophical heroine, in
the mean time, di&s;covered that her lover's per&s;o|nal
qualities did not belie his phy&s;iognomy; &s;o
that, judging there was no occa&s;ion for any farther
trial, &s;he takes a proper opportunity of communi|cating
to him her whole intention. Their inter|cour&s;e
continued for &s;ome time, till at la&s;t her
wi&s;hes were crowned, and &s;he was now mother of
a boy, who was to be the object of her future care
and concern. Gladly would &s;he have continued
her friend&s;hip with the father; but finding him
<PB N="164" REF="197">
too pa&s;&s;ionate a lover to remain within the bounds
of friend&s;hip, &s;he was obliged to put a violence
upon her&s;elf. She &s;ends him a letter, in which &s;he
had inclo&s;ed a bond of annuity for a thou&s;and
crowns; de&s;iring him, at the &s;ame time, never to
&s;ee her more, and to forget, if po&s;&s;ible, all pa&s;t
favours and familiarities. He was thunder-&s;truck
at receiving this me&s;&s;age; and, having tried, in
vain, all the arts that might win upon the re&s;olu|tion
of a woman, re&s;olved at la&s;t to attack her by
her <HI>foible.</HI> He commences a law-&s;uit again&s;t her
before the parliament of <HI>Paris;</HI> and claims his
&s;on, whom he pretends a right to educate as he
plea&s;ed, according to the u&s;ual maxims of the law
in &s;uch ca&s;es. She pleads, on the other hand,
their expre&s;s agreement before their commerce,
and pretends, that he had renounced all claim to
any offspring that might ari&s;e from their embraces.
It is not yet known, how the parliament will de|termine
in this extraordinary ca&s;e, which puzzles
all the lawyers, as much as it does the philo&s;ophers.
As &s;oon as they come to any i&s;&s;ue, I &s;hall inform

<P>THERE never was a man, who&s;e actions and

than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ter, who,
having governed a learned and free nation for &s;o

had been drawn with &s;uch <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>impartia|lity,</HI>
as to have &s;ome credit with po&s;terity, and to
&s;hew, that our liberty has, once at lea&s;t, been

failing in the former quality of judgment: but if
it &s;hould be &s;o, 'tis but one page more thrown
away, after an hundred thou&s;and, upon the &s;ame
&s;ubject, that have peri&s;hed, and become u&s;ele&s;s.
<PB N="166" REF="199">
In the mean time, I &s;hall flatter my&s;elf with the
plea&s;ing imagination, that the following character
will be adopted by future hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> Prime Mini&s;ter of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
is a man of ability, not a genius; good-natured,
not virtuous; con&s;tant, not magnani|mous;
moderate, not equitable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moderate in the exerci&s;e of power, not equitable in engro&s;&s;ing it.</NOTE>. His virtues, in
&s;ome in&s;tances, are free from the allay of tho&s;e
vices which u&s;ually accompany &s;uch virtues: he is
a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy.
His vices, in other in&s;tances, are not compen&s;ated
by tho&s;e virtues which are nearly allied to them:
his want of enterpri&s;e is not attended with fruga|lity.
The private character of the man is better
than the public; his virtues more than his vices;
his fortune greater than his fame. With many
good qualities, he has incurred the public hatred:
with good capacity, he has not e&s;caped ridicule.
He would have been e&s;teemed more worthy of his
high &s;tation, had he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; and is bet|ter
qualified for the &s;econd than for the fir&s;t place
in any government. His mini&s;try has been more
advantageous to his family than to the public,
better for this age than for po&s;terity, and more
pernicious by bad precedents than by real griev|ances.
During his time, trade has flouri&s;hed,
liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I
<PB N="167" REF="200">
am a man, I love him; as I am a &s;cholar, I hate
him; as I am a <HI>Briton,</HI> I calmly wi&s;h his fall.
And were I a Member of either Hou&s;e, I would
give my vote for removing him from St. <HI>James</HI>'s;
but &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him retire to <HI>Houghton-Hall,</HI>
to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in ea&s;e

<HEAD>A COALITION OF PARTIES AT THE

of tho&s;e who carried highe&s;t the doctrines of pa&s;|&s;ive
obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, were engaged in,
and the whole nation was ripe for, the Revolution.
The Whigs were zealous in the &s;ame cau&s;e; but
their zeal was not &s;uch as, I think, it had been
&s;ome years before, a zeal without knowledge; I
mean, that it was better tempered, and more pru|dently
conducted. Though the King was not the
better for his experience, parties were. Both &s;aw
their errors. The Tories &s;topped &s;hort in the pur|&s;uit
of a bad principle. The Whigs reformed the
abu&s;e of a good one. Both had &s;acrificed their
country to their party. Both &s;acrificed, on this
occa&s;ion, their party to their country. When the
Tories and the Whigs were thus coalited, the lat|ter
&s;tood no longer in need of any adventitious
help. If they did not refu&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e
who had weakened their cau&s;e more by the jealou|&s;ies
and fears, to which they gave both occa&s;ion
and pretence, than they had &s;trengthened it by
their numbers, yet they &s;uffered them to have no
influence in their coun&s;els, no direction of their
conduct. The cau&s;e of liberty was no longer made
<PB N="179" REF="211">
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> of a party, by being &s;et on &s;uch a bot|tom
and pu&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, as one party
alone approved. The Revolution was plainly de|&s;igned
to re&s;tore and &s;ecure our government, eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
and civil, on true foundations; and what|ever
may happen to the King, there was no room
to expect any change of the con&s;titution. There
were &s;ome, indeed, concerned in this great and
glorious undertaking, who had ob&s;tinately pre|&s;erved
or lightly taken up, the republican and
other whim&s;ies, that reigned in the days of u&s;ur|pation

and it was no fault of theirs they did not,
the coalition of parties had been broken; and in|&s;tead
of a revolution we might have had a civil
war; perhaps not even that &s;ad chance for our re|ligion
and liberty. But this leaven was &s;o near
worn out, that it could neither corrupt, nor &s;eem
any longer to corrupt, the ma&s;s of the Whig
party. The party never had been Pre&s;byterians,

Quakers; any more than the Tory party had been
Papi&s;ts, when, notwith&s;tanding their aver&s;ion to

&s;o often confounded in writing, and al|mo&s;t

and Government. By Con&s;titution we mean, when|ever

from certain fixed principles of rea&s;on di|rected
to certain fixed objects of public good, that
compo&s;e the general &s;y&s;tem, according to which

&s;ame manner, that particular tenor of conduct,
which a chief magi&s;trate, and inferior magi&s;trates
under his direction and influence, hold in the ad|mini&s;tration
of public affairs. We call this a Good

ob&s;ervation of the in&s;titutions and cu&s;toms, in
&s;hort, the whole admini&s;tration of public affairs,
is wi&s;ely pur&s;ued, and with a &s;trict conformity to
the principles and objects of the con&s;titution. We
call it a Bad Government, when it is admini&s;tered
on other principles, and directed to other objects,
either wickedly or weakly, either by obtaining
new laws which want this conformity, or by per|verting
old ones which had it; and when this is
done without law, or in open violation of the
laws, we term it a Tyrannical Government. In a
word, and to bring this home to our own ca&s;e,
Con&s;titution is the rule by which our Princes ought
to govern at all times; Government is that by
which they actually do govern at any particular
time. One may remain immutable; the other may,
and, as human nature is con&s;tituted, mu&s;t vary.
One is the criterion by which we are to try the
other; for, &s;urely, we have a right to do &s;o; &s;ince,
if we are to live in &s;ubjection to the government

to &s;ee, any further than his per&s;onal inte|re&s;t,
and the &s;upport of his admini&s;tration, require.
If &s;uch a man overcomes any actual difficulty,
avoids any immediate di&s;tre&s;s, or, without doing
either of the&s;e effectually, gains a little time, by
all the low artifice which cunning is ready to &s;ug|ge&s;t,
and ba&s;ene&s;s of mind to employ, he triumphs,
and is flattered by his mercenary train, on the
great event, which amounts often to no more than
this, that he got into di&s;tre&s;s by one &s;eries of faults,
and out of it by another. The wi&s;e mini&s;ter &s;ees,
and is concerned to &s;ee, further, becau&s;e govern|ment
has a further concern: he &s;ees the objects
that are di&s;tant, as well as tho&s;e that are near, and
all their remote relations, and even their indirect
tendencies. He thinks of &s;ame as well as applau&s;e,
and prefers that which, to be enjoyed, mu&s;t be
given, to that which may be bought. He con|&s;iders
his admini&s;tration as a &s;ingle day in the great
year of government; but as a day that is affected
by tho&s;e which went before, and that mu&s;t affect
tho&s;e which are to follow. He combines, there|fore,
<PB N="202" REF="234">
and compares, all the&s;e objects, relations,
and tendencies; and the judgment he makes on
an entire, not a partial, &s;urvey of them, is the
rule of his conduct. That &s;cheme of the rea&s;on
of &s;tate which lies open before a wi&s;e mini&s;ter,
contains all the great principles of government,
and all the great intere&s;ts of his country; &s;o that,
as he prepares &s;ome events, he prepares again&s;t
others, whether they be likely to happen during
his admini&s;tration, or in &s;ome future time.</P>

<HEAD>THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION OF
ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED

<P>THE &s;ituation of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the character
of her people, and the nature of her government,
fit her for trade and commerce. Her climate and
her &s;oil make them nece&s;&s;ary to her well-being.
<PB N="203" REF="235">
By trade and commerce we grew a rich and power|ful
nation, and by their decay we are growing
poor and impotent. As trade and commerce en|rich,
&s;o they fortify our country. The &s;ea is our
barrier, &s;hips are our fortre&s;&s;es, and the mariners,
that trade and commerce alone can furni&s;h, are the
garri&s;ons to defend them. <HI>France</HI> lies under great
di&s;advantages in trade and commerce, by the na|ture
of her government. Her advantages in &s;itua|tion
are as great, at lea&s;t, as ours. Tho&s;e that
ari&s;e from the temper and character of her people
are a little different perhaps, and yet upon the
whole equivalent. Tho&s;e of her climate and her
&s;oil are &s;uperior to ours, and indeed to tho&s;e of
any <HI>European</HI> nation. The <HI>United Provinces</HI> have
the &s;ame advantages that we have in the nature of
their government, more perhaps in the temper and
character of their people; le&s;s, to be &s;ure, in their
&s;ituation, climate, and &s;oil. But without de&s;cend|ing
into a longer detail of the advantages and di&s;|advantages
attending each of the&s;e nations, in
trade and commerce, it is &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent
purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;tands in a
certain middle between the other two, with regard
to <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>power</HI> ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;prings.
A le&s;s, and a le&s;s con&s;tant, application to the im|provement
of the&s;e may &s;erve the ends of <HI>France;</HI>
a greater is nece&s;&s;ary in this country; and a greater
&s;till in <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> may improve their
natural wealth and power by the improvement of
trade and commerce. We can have no wealth, nor
<PB N="204" REF="236">
power, by con&s;equence, as <HI>Europe</HI> is now con&s;tituted,
without the improvement of them, nor in any
degree but proportionably to this improvement.
The <HI>Dutch</HI> cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. They
bring wealth to other nations, and are nece&s;&s;ary
to the well-being of them; but they &s;upply the
<HI>Dutch</HI> with food and raiment, and are nece&s;&s;ary
even to their being.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of what has been &s;aid, is, in general,
that the wealth and power of all nations depend|ing
&s;o much on their trade and commerce, and
every nation being, like the three I have men|tioned,
in &s;uch different circum&s;tances of advan|tage
or di&s;advantage in the pur&s;uit of this com|mon
intere&s;t; a good government, and therefore
the government of a patriot King, will be directed
con&s;tantly to make the mo&s;t of every advantage
that nature has given, or art can procure, towards
the improvement of trade and commerce. And
this is one of the principal criterions, by which
we are to judge whether governors are in the true
intere&s;t of the people or not.</P>
<P>It re&s;ults, in particular, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might
improve her wealth and power in a proportion &s;u|perior
to that of any nation who can be deemed
her rival, if the advantages &s;he has were as wi&s;ely
cultivated, as they will be in the reign of a patriot
King. To be convinced more thoroughly of this
truth, a very &s;hort proce&s;s of rea&s;oning will &s;uffice.
<PB N="205" REF="237">
Let any man, who has knowledge enough for it,
fir&s;t compare the natural &s;tate of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
and of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and then their artifi|cial
&s;tate, together; that is, let him con&s;ider mi|nutely
the advantages we have by the &s;ituation,
extent, and nature, of our i&s;land, over the inha|bitants

and hardly defended from it: and, after that, let
him con&s;ider how nearly the&s;e provinces have
rai&s;ed them&s;elves to an equality of wealth and
power with the kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> From
whence ari&s;es this difference of improvement? It
ari&s;es plainly from hence: the <HI>Dutch</HI> have been,
from the foundation of their common-wealth, a
nation of <HI>patriots</HI> and <HI>merchants.</HI> The &s;pirit of
that people has not been diverted from the&s;e two
objects, the defence of their liberty, and the im|provement
of their trade and commerce; which
have been carried on by them with uninterrupted
and un&s;lackened application, indu&s;try, order, and

the reputation of the fir&s;t <HI>Scipio</HI> was not &s;o clear

not compen&s;ate for them. His failings and his

a weak Prince and an ill Man; and fell into all the
contempt wherein his memory remains to this day.
The methods he took to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from it,
&s;erved but to confirm him in it. No man can keep
the decorum of manners in life, who is not free from
every kind of <HI>affectation,</HI> as it has been &s;aid already:

a claim to &s;uch re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as

the King who lives more in their &s;ight, and more

<P>THE love of hi&s;tory &s;eems in&s;eparable from

through mankind, from <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> down to the pari&s;h|clerk
in <HI>Pope's</HI> Mi&s;cellany. We are fond of pre|&s;erving,
as far as it is in our frail power, the me|mory
of our own adventures, of tho&s;e of our own
time, and of tho&s;e that preceded it. Rude heaps
of &s;tones have been rai&s;ed, and ruder hymns have
been compo&s;ed, for this purpo&s;e, by nations who
had not yet the u&s;e of arts and letters. To go no
further back, the triumphs of <HI>Odin</HI> were cele|brated
in <HI>Runic</HI> &s;ongs, and the feats of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
ance&s;tors were recorded in tho&s;e of their bards.

and their wars are &s;ung at all their fe&s;tivals.
There is no need of &s;aying how this pa&s;&s;ion grows
among civilized nations, in proportion to the
means of gratifying it: but let us ob&s;erve that the
&s;ame principle of nature directs us as &s;trongly, and
more generally as well as more early, to indulge
our own curio&s;ity, in&s;tead of preparing to gratify
<PB N="229" REF="261">
that of others. The child hearkens with delight
to the tales of his nur&s;e; he learns to read, and he
devours with eagerne&s;s fabulous legends and no|vels.
In riper years, he applies him&s;elf to hi&s;tory,
or to that which he takes for hi&s;tory, to authori&s;ed
romance: and even in age, the de&s;ire of knowing
what has happened to other men, yields to the de|&s;ire
alone of relating what has happened to our|&s;elves.
Thus hi&s;tory, true or fal&s;e, &s;peaks to our
pa&s;&s;ions always. What pity is it, that even the
be&s;t &s;hould &s;peak to our under&s;tandings &s;o &s;eldom!
That it does &s;o, we have none to blame but our|&s;elves.
Nature has done her part. She has opened
this &s;tudy to every man who can read and think:
and what &s;he has made the mo&s;t agreeable, rea&s;on
can make the mo&s;t u&s;eful, application of our minds.
But if we con&s;ult our rea&s;on, we &s;hall be far from
following the examples of our fellow-creatures, in
this as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, who are &s;o proud of
being rational. We &s;hall neither read to &s;oothe
our indolence, nor to gratify our vanity: as little
&s;hall we content our&s;elves to drudge like gram|marians

&s;tudy, with greater ea&s;e and profit, like philo&s;o|phers
and &s;tate&s;men: as little &s;hall we affect the
&s;lender merit of becoming great &s;cholars at the
expence of groping all our lives in the dark mazes
of antiquity. All the&s;e mi&s;take the true drift of
&s;tudy, and the true u&s;e of hi&s;tory. Nature gave

<HEAD>GENIUS, HISTORY, AND EXPERIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;chool of example is the world: and the

I am far from contending that the former is pre|ferable
to the latter. I think, upon the whole,
otherwi&s;e: but this I &s;ay, that the former is ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to prepare us for the latter, and
to accompany us whil&s;t we are under the di&s;cipline

our lives. No doubt, &s;ome few men may be quoted,
to whom nature gave what art and indu&s;try can

nothing again&s;t me, becau&s;e I admit that the &s;tudy
of hi&s;tory without experience is in&s;ufficient, but
a&s;&s;ert that experience it&s;elf is &s;o without genius.
Genius is preferable to the other two; but I would
wi&s;h to find the three together: for how great &s;o|ever
a genius may be, and how much &s;oever he
may acquire new light and heat as he proceeds in
his rapid cour&s;e, certain it is that he will never
&s;hine with the full lu&s;tre, nor &s;hed the full influ|ence
he is capable of, unle&s;s to his own experience
he adds the experience of other men and other ages.
Genius, without the improvement at lea&s;t of ex|perience,
is what comets once were thought to be,
a blazing meteor, irregular in his cour&s;e, and dan|gerous
in his approach; of no u&s;e to any &s;y&s;tem,
and able to de&s;troy any. Mere &s;ons of earth, if
they have experience, without any knowledge of
the hi&s;tory of the world, are but half &s;cholars in

in hi&s;tory, without experience, they are wor&s;e

&s;ometimes meddling and pre&s;uming. The

<HEAD>EXAMPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;carce any folly or vice more epide|mical
among the &s;ons of men, than that ridicu|lous
and hurtful vanity, by which the people of
each country are apt to prefer them&s;elves to tho&s;e
of every other, and to make their own cu&s;toms,
and manners, and opinions, the &s;tandards of right
and wrong, of true and fal&s;e. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Man|darins
were &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed, and almo&s;t incre|dulous,
when the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> &s;hewed them how &s;mall
a figure their empire made in the general map of
the world. The <HI>Samojedes</HI> wondered much at the
Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> for not living among them: and
the <HI>Hottentott,</HI> who returned from <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;tripped
him&s;elf naked as &s;oon as he came home, put on
his bracelets of guts and garbage, and grew &s;tink|ing
and lou&s;y as fa&s;t as he could. Now nothing
can contribute more to prevent us from being
tainted with this vanity, than to accu&s;tom our|&s;elves
early to contemplate the different nations of
the earth in that va&s;t map which hi&s;tory &s;preads
before us, in their ri&s;e and their fall, in their bar|barous
and civilized &s;tates, in the likene&s;s and un|likene&s;s
of them all to one another, and of each
to it&s;elf. By frequently renewing this pro&s;pect to
the mind, the <HI>Mexican</HI> with his cap and coat of
feathers, &s;acrificing a human victim to his god,
will not appear more &s;avage to our eyes, than the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> with an hat on his head, and a gonilla
<PB N="233" REF="265">
round his neck, &s;acrificing whole nations to his
ambition, his avarice, and even the wantonne&s;s of
his cruelty. I might &s;hew, by a multitude of
other examples, how hi&s;tory prepares us for expe|rience,
and guides us in it: and many of the&s;e
would be both curious and important. I might
likewi&s;e bring &s;everal other in&s;tances, wherein hi|&s;tory
&s;erves to purge the mind of tho&s;e national
partialities and prejudices that we are apt to con|tract
in our education, and that experience for

<P>THE examples which hi&s;tory pre&s;ents to us,

the whole example is before us, and con|&s;equently
the whole le&s;&s;on, or &s;ometimes the va|rious
le&s;&s;ons which philo&s;ophy propo&s;es to teach
us by this example. For fir&s;t, as to men; we &s;ee
them at their whole length in hi&s;tory, and we &s;ee
them generally there through a medium le&s;s par|tial
at lea&s;t than that of experience: for I ima|gine,
that a Whig or a Tory, whil&s;t tho&s;e parties
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted, would have condemned in <HI>Saturninus</HI> the
&s;pirit of faction which he applauded in his own

<HEAD>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HISTORY AND
EXPERIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THUS again as to events that &s;tand recorded
in hi&s;tory: we &s;ee them all, we &s;ee them as they
followed one another, or as they produced one
another, cau&s;es or effects, immediate or remote.
We are ca&s;t back, as it were, into former ages:
we live with the men who lived before us, and we
inhabit countries that we never &s;aw. Place is en|larged,
and time prolonged, in this manner; &s;o
that the man who applies him&s;elf early to the
&s;tudy of hi&s;tory, may acquire in a few years, and
before he &s;ets his foot abroad in the world, not
<PB N="235" REF="267">
only a more extended knowledge of mankind, but
the experience of more centuries, than any of the
patriarchs &s;aw. The events we are witne&s;&s;es of,
in the cour&s;e of the longe&s;t life, appear to us very
often original, unprepared, &s;ingle, and un-rela|tive,
if I may u&s;e &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion for want of
a better in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> in <HI>French</HI> I would &s;ay <HI>i&s;ol&eacute;s:</HI>
they appear &s;uch very often, are called accidents,
and looked upon as the effects of chance; a word,
by the way, which is in con&s;tant u&s;e, and has no
determinate meaning. We get over the pre&s;ent
difficulty, we improve the momentary advantage,
as well as we can, and we look no farther. Ex|perience
can carry us no farther: for experience
can go a very little way back in di&s;covering
cau&s;es; and effects are not the objects of experi|ence
till they happen. From hence many errors
in judgment, and by con&s;equence in condu&s;t, ne|ce&s;&s;arily
ari&s;e. And here too lies the difference
we are &s;peaking of between hi&s;tory and experi|ence.
The advantage on the &s;ide of the former
is double. In ancient hi&s;tory, as we have &s;aid al|ready,
the examples are complete, which are in|complete
in the cour&s;e of experience. The begin|ning,
the progre&s;&s;ion, and the end appear, not of
particular reigns, much le&s;s of particular enter|pri&s;es,
or &s;y&s;tems of policy alone, but of govern|ments,
of nations, of empires, and of all the va|rious
&s;y&s;tems that have &s;ucceeded one another in
the cour&s;e of their duration. In modern hi&s;tory,
the examples may be, and &s;ometimes are, in|complete;
<PB N="236" REF="268">
but they have this advantage when
they are &s;o, that they &s;erve to render complete the
examples of our own time. Experience is doubly
defective; we are born too late to &s;ee the begin|ning,
and we die too &s;oon to &s;ee the end of many
things. Hi&s;tory &s;upplies both the&s;e defects. Mo|dern
hi&s;tory &s;hews the cau&s;es, when experience
pre&s;ents the effects alone: and ancient hi&s;tory ena|bles
us to gue&s;s at the effects, when experience
pre&s;ents the cau&s;es alone.</P>

<HEAD>EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT now is education? that part, that
principal and mo&s;t neglected part of it, I mean,
which tends to form the moral character? It is,
I think, an in&s;titution de&s;igned to lead men from
their tender years, by precept and example, by
argument and authority, to the practice, and to
the habit of practi&s;ing the&s;e rules. The &s;tronger
our appetites, de&s;ires, and pa&s;&s;ions are, the harder
indeed is the ta&s;k of education; but, when the
efforts of education are proportioned to this
&s;trength, although our keene&s;t appetites and de|&s;ires,
and our ruling pa&s;&s;ions, cannot be reduced
to a quiet and uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, yet are not
their exce&s;&s;es a&s;&s;uaged? are not their abu&s;es and
mi&s;applications, in &s;ome degree, diverted or check|ed?
Though the pilot cannot lay the &s;torm, can|not
he carry the &s;hip by his art better through it,
<PB N="237" REF="269">
and often prevent the wreck that would always
happen without him? If <HI>Alexander,</HI> who loved
wine, and was naturally choleric, had been bred
under the &s;everity of <HI>Roman</HI> di&s;cipline, it is pro|bable
he would neither have made a bonfire of
<HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> for his whore, nor have killed his friend.
If <HI>Scipio,</HI> who was naturally given to women, for
which anecdote we have, if I mi&s;take not, the
authority of <HI>Polybius,</HI> as well as &s;ome ver&s;es of
<HI>Naevius</HI> pre&s;erved by <HI>A. Gellius,</HI> had been edu|cated
by <HI>Olympias</HI> at the court of <HI>Philip,</HI> it is im|probable
that he would have re&s;tored the beautiful
<HI>Spaniard.</HI> In &s;hort, if the renowned <HI>Socrates</HI> had
not corrected nature by art, this fir&s;t apo&s;tle of the
Gentiles had been a very profligate fellow by his
own confe&s;&s;ion; for he was inclined to all the
vices <HI>Zopyrus</HI> imputed to him, as they &s;ay, on the
ob&s;ervation of his phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>With him, therefore, who denies the effects of
education, it would be in vain to di&s;pute; and
with him who admits them, there can be no di&s;|pute
concerning that &s;hare which I a&s;cribe to the
&s;tudy of hi&s;tory, in forming our moral characters,
and making us better men. The very per&s;ons
who pretend that inclinations cannot be re&s;trained,
nor habits corrected, again&s;t our natural bent,
would be the fir&s;t perhaps to prove in certain ca&s;es
the contrary. A fortune at court, or the favours
of a lady, have prevailed on many to conceal,
and they could not conceal without re&s;training,
<PB N="238" REF="270">
which is one &s;tep towards correcting, the vices
they were by nature addicted to the mo&s;t. Shall
we imagine now, that the beauty of virtue and the
deformity of vice, the charms of a bright and la&s;t|ing
reputation, the terror of being delivered over
as criminals to all po&s;terity, the real benefit ari|&s;ing
from a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the duty we
owe to others, which benefit fortune can neither
hinder nor take away, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of
conforming our&s;elves to the de&s;igns of God, ma|nife&s;ted
in the con&s;titution of the human nature;
&s;hall we imagine, I &s;ay, that all the&s;e are not
able to acquire the &s;ame power over tho&s;e who are
continually called upon to a contemplation of
them, and they who apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy
of hi&s;tory are &s;o called upon, as other motives,

neglected entirely, not only without detriment,
but with advantage. Some are the proper objects
of one man's curio&s;ity, &s;ome of others, and &s;ome
of all men's; but all hi&s;tory is not an object of
curio&s;ity for any man. He who improperly, wan|tonly,

of them dige&s;ts. They heap crudity upon
crudity, and nouri&s;h and improve nothing but
their di&s;temper. Some &s;uch characters I have
known, though it is not the mo&s;t common ex|treme
into which men are apt to fall. One of
them I knew in this country. He joined, to a
more than athletic &s;trength of body, a prodigious
memory, and to both a prodigious indu&s;try. He
had read almo&s;t con&s;tantly twelve or fourteen hours
a day, for five-and-twenty or thirty years; and
had heaped together as much learning as could
be crouded into an head. In the cour&s;e of my ac|quaintance
with him, I con&s;ulted him once or
twice, not oftener; for I found this ma&s;s of learn|ing
of as little u&s;e to me as to the owner. The
man was communicative enough, but nothing was
di&s;tinct in his mind. How could it be otherwi&s;e?
he had never &s;pared time to think; all was em|ployed
in reading. His rea&s;on had not the merit
of common mechani&s;m. When you pre&s;s a watch,
or pull a clock, they an&s;wer your que&s;tion with

preci&s;ion; for they repeat exactly the hour of the
day, and tell you neither more nor le&s;s than you
de&s;ire to know. But when you a&s;ked this man a
que&s;tion, he overwhelmed you by pouring forth
all that the &s;everal terms or words of your que&s;|tion
recalled to his memory: and, if he omitted
any thing, it was that very thing to which the
&s;en&s;e of the whole que&s;tion &s;hould have led him
and confined him. To a&s;k him a que&s;tion, was
to wind up a &s;pring in his memory, that rattled
on with va&s;t rapidity, and confu&s;ed noi&s;e, till the

<HEAD>REASON AND INSTINCT.</HEAD>
<P>THE far greate&s;t part of mankind appears re|duced

very re&s;pect, on account of which we claim &s;o
great &s;uperiority over them; becau&s;e in&s;tinct, that
has its due effect, is preferable to rea&s;on that has
not. I &s;uppo&s;e in this place, with philo&s;ophers,
and the vulgar, that which I am in no wi&s;e ready
to affirm, that other animals have no &s;hare of hu|man
rea&s;on: for, let me &s;ay by the way, it is
much more likely other animals &s;hould &s;hare the
human, which is denied, than that man &s;hould
&s;hare the divine rea&s;on, which is affirmed, But,
&s;uppo&s;ing our monopoly of rea&s;on, would not your
lord&s;hip chu&s;e to walk upon four legs, to wear a
<PB N="241" REF="273">
long tail, and to be called a bea&s;t, with the ad|vantage
of being determined by irre&s;i&s;tible and
unerring in&s;tinct to tho&s;e truths that are nece&s;&s;ary
to your well-being; rather than to walk on two
legs, to wear no tail, and to be honoured with the
title of man, at the expence of deviating from
them perpetually? In&s;tinct acts &s;pontaneou&s;ly,
whenever its action is nece&s;&s;ary, and directs the
animal according to the purpo&s;e for which it was
implanted in him. Rea&s;on is a nobler and more
exten&s;ive faculty; for it extends to the unnece&s;&s;ary
as well as nece&s;&s;ary, and to &s;atisfy our curio&s;ity as
well as our wants: but rea&s;on mu&s;t be excited, or
&s;he will remain unactive; &s;he mu&s;t be left free, or
&s;he will conduct us wrong, and carry us farther
a&s;tray from her own precincts than we &s;hould go

of one, and le&s;s of the other, than is commonly

of human life, are &s;ome of the principal common-place
<PB N="244" REF="276">
complaints, which we prefer again&s;t the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
order of things: they are the grumblings
of the vulgar, and the pathetic lamentations of the
philo&s;opher; but they are impertinent and impious
in both. The man of bu&s;ine&s;s de&s;pi&s;es the man of

of plea&s;ure pities or laughs at the man of bu&s;ine&s;s,
for the &s;ame thing: and yet both concur &s;uperci|liou&s;ly
and ab&s;urdly to find fault with the <HI>Supreme
Being,</HI> for having given them &s;o little time. The
philo&s;opher, who mi&s;pends it very often as much
as the others, joins in the &s;ame cry, and authori&s;es
this impiety. <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> thought it extremely
hard to die at ninety, and to go out of the world
when he had ju&s;t learned how to live in it. His
ma&s;ter <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> found fault with nature, for treat|ing
man in this re&s;pect wor&s;e than &s;everal other

<HI>Seneca</HI> the better for his quarrel with the <HI>Stagirite</HI>
on this head. We &s;ee, in &s;o many in&s;tances, a ju&s;t
proportion of things, according to their &s;everal
relations to one another, that philo&s;ophy &s;hould
lead us to conclude this proportion pre&s;erved even
where we cannot di&s;cern it; in&s;tead of leading us
to conclude that it is not pre&s;erved where we do
not di&s;cern it, or where we think that we &s;ee
the contrary. To conclude otherwi&s;e, is &s;hocking
pre&s;umption. It is to pre&s;ume that the &s;y&s;tem of
the univer&s;e would have been more wi&s;ely con|trived,
if creatures of our low rank among intel|lectual
natures had been called to the councils of
<PB N="245" REF="277">
the Mo&s;t High; or that the Creator ought to mend
his work by the advice of the creature. That life
which &s;eems to our &s;elf-love &s;o &s;hort, when we
compare it with the ideas we frame of eternity, or
even with the duration of &s;ome other beings, will
appear &s;ufficient, upon a le&s;s partial view, to all
the ends of our creation, and of a ju&s;t proportion
in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive cour&s;e of generations. The term
it&s;elf is long: we render it &s;hort; and the want
we complain of flows from our profu&s;ion, not from
our poverty. We are all arrant &s;pend thrifts; &s;ome
of us di&s;&s;ipate our e&s;tates on the trifles, &s;ome on the
&s;uperfluities, and then we all complain that we
want the nece&s;&s;aries, of life. The much greate&s;t
part never reclaim, but die bankrupts to God and
man. Others reclaim late; and they are apt to
imagine, when they make up their accounts and
&s;ee how their fund is dimini&s;hed, that they have not
enough remaining to live upon, becau&s;e they have not
the whole. But they deceive them&s;elves: they were
richer than they thought, and they are not yet poor.
If they hu&s;band well the remainder, it will be
found &s;ufficient for all the nece&s;&s;aries, and for &s;ome

of their empire How many migrations have there
been, in return to the&s;e, from <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia!</HI>

e&s;tabli&s;hed a kingdom. The <HI>European Scythians</HI>
over-run the&s;e va&s;t provinces, and carried their

us therefore impo&s;e an equal temper on our minds,

more &s;avage than the bea&s;ts: and if we e&s;cape the

This e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things it is not in our
