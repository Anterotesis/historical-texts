<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fine arts have ever been en|couraged by wi&s;e princes, not &s;ingly for private amu&s;ement, but for their beneficial influence in &s;o|ciety. By uniting different ranks in the &s;ame elegant plea&s;ures, they promote be|nevolence: by cheri&s;hing love of order, they inforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government: and by in&s;piring delicacy of feeling, they make regular government a double ble&s;&s;|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
THESE con&s;iderations embolden me to hope for your Maje&s;ty's patronage in behalf of the following work, which treats of the fine arts, and attempts to form a &s;tandard of ta&s;te by unfolding tho&s;e principles that ought to govern the ta&s;te of every individual.</P>
<P>IT is rare to find one born with &s;uch delicacy of feeling, as not to need in&s;truc|tion: it is equally rare to find one &s;o low in feeling, as not to be capable of in&s;truc|tion. And yet, to refine our ta&s;te with re&s;pect to beauties of art or of nature, is &s;carce endeavoured in any &s;eminary of learning; a lamentable defect, con&s;ider|ing how early in life ta&s;te is &s;u&s;ceptible of culture, and how difficult to reform it if unhappily perverted. To furni&s;h mate|rials for &s;upplying that defect, was an additional motive for the pre&s;ent under|taking.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
TO promote the fine arts in Britain, has become of greater importance than is generally imagined. A flouri&s;hing com|merce begets opulence; and opulence, inflaming our appetite for plea&s;ure, is commonly vented on luxury and on every &s;en&s;ual gratification: Selfi&s;hne&s;s rears its head; becomes fa&s;hionable; and infect|ing all ranks, extingui&s;hes the <HI>amor patriae</HI> and every &s;park of public &s;pirit. To pre|vent or to retard &s;uch fatal corruption, the genius of an Alfred cannot devi&s;e any means more efficacious, than venting o|pulence upon the fine arts. Riches &s;o employ'd, in&s;tead of encouraging vice, will excite both public and private vir|tue. Of this happy effect, ancient Greece furni&s;hes one &s;hining in&s;tance; and why &s;hould we de&s;pair of another in Britain?</P>
<P>IN the commencement of an au&s;picious reign, and even in that early period of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
life when plea&s;ure commonly is the &s;ole pur&s;uit, your Maje&s;ty has uniformly di&s;|play'd to a delighted people, the noble&s;t principles, ripened by early culture; and for that rea&s;on, you will be the more di&s;|po&s;ed to favour every rational plan for advancing the art of training up youth. Among the many branches of education, that which tends to make deep impre&s;|&s;ions of virtue, ought to be a funda|mental mea&s;ure in a well-regulated go|vernment: for depravity of manners will render ineffectual the mo&s;t &s;alutary laws; and in the mid&s;t of opulence, what other means to prevent &s;uch depravity but early and virtuous di&s;cipline? The Briti&s;h di&s;cipline is &s;u&s;ceptible of great improve|ments; and if we can hope for them, it mu&s;t be from a young and accompli&s;hed Prince, eminently &s;en&s;ible of their im|portance. To e&s;tabli&s;h a complete &s;y&s;tem of education, &s;eems re&s;erved by provi|dence for a Sovereign who commands
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the hearts of his &s;ubjects. Succe&s;s will crown the undertaking, and endear GEORGE THE THIRD to our late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t elevated and mo&s;t refined plea&s;ure of human nature, is enjoy'd by a virtuous prince governing a virtuous people; and that, by perfecting the great &s;y&s;tem of education, your Maje&s;ty may very long enjoy this plea&s;ure, is the ar|dent wi&s;h of </P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE five &s;en&s;es agree in the follow|ing particular, that nothing external is perceived till it fir&s;t make an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the organ of &s;en&s;e; the im|pre&s;&s;ion, for example, made upon the hand by a &s;tone, upon the palate by &s;ugar, and upon the no&s;trils by a ro&s;e. But there is a difference as to our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that impre&s;&s;ion. In touching, ta&s;ting, and &s;melling, we are con&s;cious of the impre&s;|&s;ion. Not &s;o in &s;eeing and hearing. When I behold a tree, I am not &s;en&s;ible of the impre&s;&s;ion made upon my eye; nor of the impre&s;&s;ion made upon my ear, when I li&s;ten to a &s;ong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix, &sect; 13.</NOTE>. This difference in the manner of perception, di&s;tingui&s;hes remark|ably hearing and &s;eeing from the other &s;en&s;es; and di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;till more remark|ably the feelings of the former from tho&s;e of the latter. A feeling plea&s;ant or painful cannot exi&s;t but in the mind; and yet be|cau&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="10">
in ta&s;ting, touching, and &s;melling, we are con&s;cious of the impre&s;&s;ion made upon the organ, we naturally place there al&s;o, the plea&s;ant or painful feeling cau&s;ed by that impre&s;&s;ion. And becau&s;e &s;uch feel|ings &s;eem to be placed externally at the or|gan of &s;en&s;e, we, for that rea&s;on, conceive them to be merely corporeal. We have a different apprehen&s;ion of the plea&s;ant and painful feelings derived from &s;eeing and hearing. Being in&s;en&s;ible here of the or|ganic impre&s;&s;ion, we are not mi&s;led to a&s;|&s;ign a wrong place to the&s;e feelings; and therefore we naturally place them in the mind, where they really exi&s;t. Upon that account, they are conceived to be more refined and &s;piritual, than what are deri|ved from ta&s;ting, touching, and &s;melling.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of the eye and ear being thus elevated above tho&s;e of the other ex|ternal &s;en&s;es, acquire &s;o much dignity as to make them a laudable entertainment. They are not, however, &s;et upon a level with tho&s;e that are purely intellectual; being not le&s;s inferior in dignity to intellectual plea&s;ures, than &s;uperior to the organic or corporeal.
<PB N="3" REF="11">
They indeed re&s;emble the latter, being like them produced by external objects: but they al&s;o re&s;emble the former, being like them produced without any &s;en&s;ible orga|nic impre&s;&s;ion. Their mixt nature and middle place betwixt organic and intellec|tual plea&s;ures, qualify them to a&s;&s;ociate with either. Beauty heightens all the or|ganic feelings, as well as tho&s;e that are in|tellectual. Harmony, though it a&s;pires to inflame devotion, di&s;dains not to improve the reli&s;h of a banquet.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of the eye and ear have other valuable properties be&s;ide tho&s;e of dignity and elevation. Being &s;weet and moderately exhilerating, they are in their tone equally di&s;tant from the turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion, and languor of inaction; and by that tone are perfectly well qualified, not only to revive the &s;pirits when &s;unk by &s;en|&s;ual gratification, but al&s;o to relax them when over&s;trained in any violent pur&s;uit. Here is a remedy provided for many di|&s;tre&s;&s;es. And to be convinced of its &s;alutary effects, it will be &s;ufficient to run over the following particulars. Organic plea&s;ures
<PB N="4" REF="12">
have naturally a &s;hort duration: when con|tinued too long, or indulged to exce&s;s, they lo&s;e their reli&s;h, and beget &s;atiety and di&s;|gu&s;t. To relieve us from that unea&s;ine&s;s, nothing can be more happily contrived than the exhilerating plea&s;ures of the eye and ear, which take place imperceptibly, with|out much varying the tone of mind. On the other hand, any inten&s;e exerci&s;e of the intellectual powers, becomes painful by over&s;training the mind. Ce&s;&s;ation from &s;uch exerci&s;e gives not in&s;tant relief: it is nece&s;&s;ary that the void be filled with &s;ome amu&s;ement, gently relaxing the &s;pirits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Du Bos judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that &s;ilence doth not tend to calm an agitated mind; but that &s;oft and &s;low mu&s;ic hath a fine effect.</NOTE>. Organic plea&s;ure, which hath no reli&s;h but while we are in vigour, is ill qualified for that office: but the finer plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, which occupy without exhau&s;ting the mind, are excellently well qualified to re&s;tore its u&s;ual tone after &s;evere application to &s;tudy or bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as after &s;atiety from &s;en&s;ual gratification.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t perceptions are of external ob|jects,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
and our fir&s;t attachments are to them. Organic plea&s;ures take the lead. But the mind, gradually ripening, reli&s;heth more and more the plea&s;ures of the eye and ear; which approach the purely mental, without exhau&s;ting the &s;pirits; and exceed the pure|ly &s;en&s;ual, without danger of &s;atiety. The plea&s;ures of the eye and ear have accor|dingly a natural aptitude to attract us from the immoderate gratification of &s;en&s;ual appe|tite. For the mind, once accu&s;tomed to enjoy a variety of external objects without being con&s;cious of the organic impre&s;&s;ion, is prepared for enjoying internal objects where there cannot be an organic impre&s;|&s;ion. Thus the author of nature, by qua|lifying the human mind for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enjoyments from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t, leads it by gentle &s;teps from the mo&s;t gro|veling corporeal plea&s;ures, for which &s;olely it is fitted in the beginning of life, to tho&s;e refined and &s;ublime plea&s;ures which are &s;uited to its maturity.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, however, is not govern|ed by unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity. The God of nature offers it to us, in order to advance
<PB N="6" REF="14">
our happine&s;s; and it is &s;ufficient, that he hath enabled us to complete the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Nor has he made our ta&s;k di&s;agreeable or difficult. On the contrary, the tran&s;ition is &s;weet and ea&s;y, from corporeal plea&s;ures to the more refined plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e; and not le&s;s &s;o, from the&s;e to the exalted plea|&s;ures of morality and religion. We &s;tand therefore engaged in honour, as well as in|tere&s;t, to &s;econd the purpo&s;es of nature, by cultivating the plea&s;ures of the eye and ear, tho&s;e e&s;pecially that require extraordinary culture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A ta&s;te for natural objects is born with us in perfection. To reli&s;h a fine countenance, a rich land&s;cape, or a vivid co|lour, culture is unnece&s;&s;ary. The ob&s;ervation holds equally in natural &s;ounds, &s;uch as the &s;inging of birds, or the mur|muring of a brook. Nature here, the artificer of the object as well as of the percipient, hath &s;uited them to each other with great accuracy. But of a poem, a cantata, a picture, and other artificial productions, a true reli&s;h is not commonly attained without &s;tudy and practice.</NOTE>, &s;uch as are in&s;pired by poetry, painting, &s;culpture, mu&s;ic, gardening, and architecture. This chiefly is the duty of the opulent, who have lei&s;ure to improve their minds and their feelings. The fine arts are contrived to give plea&s;ure to the eye
<PB N="7" REF="15">
and the ear, di&s;regarding the inferior &s;en&s;es. A ta&s;te for the&s;e arts is a plant that grows naturally in many &s;oils; but, without cul|ture, &s;carce to perfection in any &s;oil. It is &s;u&s;ceptible of much refinement; and is, by proper care, greatly improved. In this re|&s;pect, a ta&s;te in the fine arts goes hand in hand with the moral &s;en&s;e, to which indeed it is nearly allied. Both of them di&s;cover what is right and what is wrong. Fa&s;hion, temper, and education, have an influence upon both, to vitiate them, or to pre&s;erve them pure and untainted. Neither of them are arbitrary or local. They are rooted in human nature, and are governed by principles common to all men. The prin|ciples of morality belong not to the pre&s;ent undertaking. But as to the principles of the fine arts, they are evolved, by &s;tudying the &s;en&s;itive part of human nature, and by learning what objects are naturally agreeable, and what are naturally di&s;agreeable. The man who a&s;pires to be a critic in the&s;e arts, mu&s;t pierce &s;till deeper. He mu&s;t clearly perceive what objects are lofty, what low, what are proper or improper, what are man|ly,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
and what are mean or trivial. Hence a foundation for judging of ta&s;te, and for rea|&s;oning upon it. Where it is conformable to principles, we can pronounce with certain|ty, that it is correct; otherwi&s;e, that it is incorrect, and perhaps whim&s;ical. Thus the fine arts, like morals, become a rational &s;cience; and, like morals, may be cultiva|ted to a high degree of refinement.</P>
<P>Manifold are the advantages of critici&s;m, when thus &s;tudied as a rational &s;cience. In the fir&s;t place, a thorough acquaintance with the principles of the fine arts, redoubles the entertainment the&s;e arts afford. To the man who re&s;igns him&s;elf entirely to &s;en|timent or feeling, without interpo&s;ing any &s;ort of judgment, poetry, mu&s;ic, painting, are mere pa&s;time. In the prime of life, indeed, they are delightful, being &s;upported by the force of novelty, and the heat of imagination. But they lo&s;e their reli&s;h gra|dually with their novelty; and are generally neglected in the maturity of life, which di&s;|po&s;es to more &s;erious and more important occupations. To tho&s;e who deal in critici&s;m as a regular &s;cience, governed by ju&s;t prin|ciples,
<PB N="9" REF="17">
and giving &s;cope to judgment as well as to fancy, the fine arts are a favourite en|tertainment; and in old age maintain that reli&s;h which they produce in the morning of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">"Though logic may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without rhetoric or poetry, yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e la&s;t is a &s;ound and correct logic, that without it they are no better than warbling trifles." <BIBL>Hermes, p. 6.</BIBL></Q></P> </NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the next place, a philo&s;ophic inquiry into the principles of the fine arts, inures the reflecting mind to the mo&s;t enticing &s;ort of logic. Rea&s;oning upon &s;ubjects &s;o a|greeable tends to a habit; and a habit, &s;trengthening the rea&s;oning faculties, pre|pares the mind for entering into &s;ubjects more difficult and ab&s;tract. To have, in this re&s;pect, a ju&s;t conception of the im|portance of critici&s;m, we need but reflect upon the common method of education; which, after &s;ome years &s;pent in acquiring languages, hurries us, without the lea&s;t pre|paratory di&s;cipline, into the mo&s;t profound philo&s;ophy. A more effectual method to alienate the tender mind from ab&s;tract &s;ci|ence, is beyond the reach of invention.
<PB N="10" REF="18">
With re&s;pect to &s;uch &s;peculations, the bulk of our youth contract a &s;ort of hobgoblin terror, which is &s;eldom, if ever, &s;ubdued. Tho&s;e who apply to the arts, are trained in a very different manner. They are led, &s;tep by &s;tep, from the ea&s;ier parts of the opera|tion, to what are more difficult; and are not permitted to make a new motion, till they be perfected in tho&s;e which regularly precede it. The &s;cience of critici&s;m appears then to be an intermediate link, finely qua|lified for connecting the different parts of education into a regular chain. This &s;cience furni&s;heth an inviting opportunity to exerci&s;e the judgement: we delight to rea&s;on upon &s;ubjects that are equally plea&s;ant and fami|liar: we proceed gradually from the &s;im|pler to the more involved ca&s;es: and in a due cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, cu&s;tom, which im|proves all our faculties, be&s;tows acutene&s;s upon tho&s;e of rea&s;on, &s;ufficient to unravel all the intricacies of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that the rea&s;onings employed upon the fine arts are of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which regulate our conduct. Mathematical and metaphy|&s;ical
<PB N="11" REF="19">
rea&s;onings have no tendency to improve &s;ocial intercour&s;e: nor are they applicable to the common affairs of life. But a ju&s;t ta&s;te in the fine arts, derived from rational principles, is a fine preparation for acting in the &s;ocial &s;tate with dignity and propri|ety.</P>
<P>The &s;cience of critici&s;m tends to improve the heart not le&s;s than the under&s;tanding. I ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that it hath a fine effect in moderating the &s;elfi&s;h affec|tions. A ju&s;t ta&s;te in the fine arts, by &s;weetening and harmonizing the temper, is a &s;trong antidote to the turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion and violence of pur&s;uit. Elegance of ta&s;te procures to a man &s;o much enjoy|ment at home, or ea&s;ily within reach, that in order to be occupied, he is, in youth, under no temptation to precipitate into hunt|ing, gaming, drinking; nor, in middle age, to deliver him&s;elf over to ambition; nor, in old age, to avarice. Pride, a di&s;|gu&s;tful &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, exerts it&s;elf without control, when accompanied with a bad ta&s;te. A man of this &s;tamp, upon whom the mo&s;t &s;triking beauty makes but a faint impre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="12" REF="20">
feels no joy but in gratifying his ruling pa&s;|&s;ion by the di&s;covery of errors and blemi&s;hes. Pride, on the other hand, finds in the con|&s;titution no enemy more formidable than a delicate and di&s;cerning ta&s;te. The man up|on whom nature and culture have be&s;towed this ble&s;&s;ing, feels great delight in the vir|tuous di&s;po&s;itions and actions of others. He loves to cheri&s;h them, and to publi&s;h them to the world. Faults and failings, it is true, are to him not le&s;s obvious: but the&s;e he avoids, or removes out of &s;ight, becau&s;e they give him pain. In a word, there may be other pa&s;&s;ions, which, for a &s;ea&s;on, di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety more than pride: but no other pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o unwearied an antagoni&s;t to the &s;weets of &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Pride, tending a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to its gratification, puts a man perpetually in oppo&s;ition to others; and di&s;po&s;es him more to reli&s;h bad than good qualities, even in a bo&s;om friend. How different that di&s;po&s;ition of mind, where every virtue in a companion or neighbour, is, by refinement of ta&s;te, &s;et in its &s;trong|e&s;t light; and defects or blemi&s;hes, natu|ral
<PB N="13" REF="21">
to all, are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or kept out of view?</P>
<P>In the next place, delicacy of ta&s;te tends not le&s;s to invigorate the &s;ocial affections, than to moderate tho&s;e that are &s;elfi&s;h. To be convinced of this tendency, we need on|ly reflect, that delicacy of ta&s;te nece&s;&s;arily heightens our &s;en&s;ibility of pain and plea|&s;ure, and of cour&s;e our &s;ympathy, which is the capital branch of every &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion. Sympathy in particular invites a communi|cation of joys and &s;orrows, hopes and fears. Such exerci&s;e, &s;oothing and &s;atisfactory in it&s;elf, is productive nece&s;&s;arily of mutual good-will and affection.</P>
<P>One other advantage of critici&s;m is re|&s;erved to the la&s;t place, being of all the mo&s;t important, that it is a great &s;upport to morality. I in&s;i&s;t on it with entire &s;ati&s;|faction, that no occupation attaches a man more to his duty than that of cultivating a ta&s;te in the fine arts. A ju&s;t reli&s;h of what is beautiful, proper, elegant, and orna|mental, in writing or painting, in architec|ture or gardening, is a fine preparation for di&s;cerning what is beautiful, ju&s;t, elegant,
<PB N="14" REF="22">
or magnanimous, in character and beha|viour. To the man who has acquired a ta&s;te &s;o acute and accompli&s;hed, every ac|tion, wrong or improper, mu&s;t be highly di&s;gu&s;tful. If, in any in&s;tance, the over-bearing power of pa&s;&s;ion &s;way him from his duty, he returns to it upon the fir&s;t re|flection, with redoubled re&s;olution never to be &s;wayed a &s;econd time. He has now an additional motive to virtue, a conviction de|rived from experience, that happine&s;s de|pends on regularity and order, and that a di&s;regard to ju&s;tice or propriety never fails to be puni&s;hed with &s;hame and remor&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Genius is allied to a warm and inflammable con&s;titution, delicacy of ta&s;te to calmne&s;s and &s;edatene&s;s. Hence it is common to find genius in one who is a prey to every pa&s;|&s;ion; which can &s;carce happen with re&s;pect to delicacy of ta&s;te. Upon a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this ble&s;&s;ing, the moral duties, as well as the fine arts, make a deep impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to counterbalance every irregular de&s;ire. And even &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;trong temptation, it can take no fa&s;t hold of a calm and &s;edate temper.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Rude ages exhibit the triumph of autho|rity over rea&s;on. Philo&s;ophers anciently were divided into &s;ects: they were either Epicureans, Platoni&s;ts, Stoics, Pythago|reans,
<PB N="15" REF="23">
or Sceptics. Men relied no farther upon their own judgement than to chu&s;e a leader, whom they implicitly followed. In later times, happily, rea&s;on hath ob|tained the a&s;cendant. Men now a&s;&s;ert their native privilege of thinking for them&s;elves, and di&s;dain to be ranked in any &s;ect, what|ever be the &s;cience. I mu&s;t except criti|ci&s;m, which, by what fatality I know not, continues to be not le&s;s &s;lavi&s;h in its princi|ples, nor le&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to authority, than it was originally. Bo&s;&s;u, a celebrated French critic, gives many rules; but can di&s;cover no better foundation for any of them, than the practice merely of Ho|mer and Virgil, &s;upported by the au|thority of Ari&s;totle. Strange, that in &s;o long a work, the concordance or di&s;cord|ance of the&s;e rules with human nature, &s;hould never once have entered his thoughts! It could not &s;urely be his opinion, that the&s;e poets, however eminent for genius, were intitled to give laws to mankind, and that nothing now remains but blind obe|dience to their arbitrary will. If in writing they followed no rule, why &s;hould they be imitated? If they &s;tudied nature, and
<PB N="16" REF="24">
were ob&s;equious to rational principles, why &s;hould the&s;e be concealed from us?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent undertaking, it is not the author's intention to give a re|gular treati&s;e upon each of the fine arts in particular; but only, in general, to apply to them &s;ome remarks and ob&s;ervations drawn from human nature, the true &s;ource of critici&s;m. The fine arts are calculated for our entertainment, or for making agree|able impre&s;&s;ions; and, by that circum&s;tance, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the u&s;eful arts. In order then to be a critic in the fine arts, it is nece&s;&s;ary, as above hinted, to know what objects are naturally agreeable, and what naturally di&s;agreeable. A complete treati&s;e on that &s;ubject would be a field by far too exten&s;ive to be thoroughly cultivated by any one hand. The author pretends only to have entered upon the &s;ubject &s;o far as ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting his critical remarks. And he a&s;&s;umes no merit from his perform|ance, but that of evincing, perhaps more di&s;tinctly than hitherto has been done, that the genuine rules of critici&s;m are all of them derived from the human heart. The
<PB N="17" REF="25">
&s;en&s;itive part of our nature is a delightful &s;peculation. What the author hath di&s;co|vered or collected upon that &s;ubject, he chu&s;es to impart in the gay and agreeable form of critici&s;m; becau&s;e he imagines, that this form will be more reli&s;hed, and perhaps be not le&s;s in&s;tructive, than a re|gular and laboured di&s;qui&s;ition. His plan is, to a&s;cend gradually to principles, from facts and experiments, in&s;tead of beginning with the former, handled ab&s;tractly, and de&s;cending to the latter. But though cri|tici&s;m be thus his only declared aim, he will not di&s;own, that all along he had it in view, to explain the nature of man, con|&s;idered as a &s;en&s;itive being, capable of plea|&s;ure and pain. And though he flatters him&s;elf with having made &s;ome progre&s;s in that important &s;cience, he is however too &s;en&s;ible of its extent and difficulty, to un|dertake it profe&s;&s;edly, or to avow it as the chief purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent work.</P>
<P>To cen&s;ure works, not men, is the ju&s;t prerogative of critici&s;m; and accordingly all per&s;onal cen&s;ure is here avoided, unle&s;s where nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate &s;ome general
<PB N="18" REF="26">
propo&s;ition. No prai&s;e is claimed on that account; becau&s;e cen&s;uring with a view merely to find fault, is an entertainment that humanity never reli&s;hes. Writers, one would imagine, &s;hould, above all o|thers, be re&s;erved upon that article, when they lie &s;o open to retaliation. The author of this treati&s;e, far from being confident of meriting no cen&s;ure, entertains not even the &s;lighte&s;t hope of &s;uch perfection. A|mu&s;ement was at fir&s;t the &s;ole aim of his inquiries. Proceeding from one particular to another, the &s;ubject grew under his hand; and he was far advanced before the thought &s;truck him, that his private medi|tations might be publicly u&s;eful. In pu|blic, however, he would not appear in a &s;lovenly dre&s;s; and therefore he pretends not otherwi&s;e to apologi&s;e for his errors, than by ob&s;erving, that, in a new &s;ubject, not le&s;s nice than exten&s;ive, errors are in &s;ome mea&s;ure unavoidable. Neither pre|tends he to ju&s;tify his ta&s;te in every parti|cular. That point mu&s;t be extremely clear, which admits not variety of opinion; and in &s;ome matters &s;u&s;ceptible of great refine|ment,
<PB N="19" REF="27">
time is perhaps the only infallible touch-&s;tone of ta&s;te. To this he appeals, and to this he chearfully &s;ubmits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Perceptions and ideas in a train.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN while awake is &s;en&s;ible of a continued train of objects pa&s;&s;ing in his mind. It requires no activity on his part to carry on the train: nor has he power to vary it by calling up an object at will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For how &s;hould this be done? What object is it that we are to call up? If this que&s;tion can be an&s;wered, the object is already in the mind, and there is no occa&s;ion to exert the power. If the que&s;tion cannot be an&s;wered, I next demand, how it is po&s;&s;ible that a voluntary power can be exerted without any view of an object to exert it upon? We cannot form a conception of &s;uch a thing. This argu|ment appears to me &s;atisfactory: if it need confirmation, I urge experience. Whoever makes a trial will find, that objects are linked together in the mind, forming a connect|ed chain; and that we have not the command of any object independent of the chain.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time we
<PB N="22" REF="29">
learn from daily experience, that a train of thought is not merely ca&s;ual. And if it depend not upon will, nor upon chance, we mu&s;t try to evolve by what law it is governed. The &s;ubject is of import|ance in the &s;cience of human nature; and I promi&s;e beforehand, that it will be found of great importance in the fine arts.</P>
<P>It appears that the relations by which things are linked together, have a great in|fluence in directing the train of thought; and we find by experience, that objects are connected in the mind preci&s;ely as they are externally. Beginning then with things external, we find that they are not more remarkable by their inherent properties than by their various relations. We can|not any where extend our view without perceiving things connected together by certain relations. One thing perceived to be a cau&s;e, is connected with its &s;everal
<PB N="23" REF="30">
effects; &s;ome things are connected by con|tiguity in time, others by contiguity in place; &s;ome are connected by re&s;emblance, &s;ome by contra&s;t; &s;ome go before, &s;ome follow. Not a &s;ingle thing appears &s;oli|tary, and altogether devoid of connection. The only difference is, that &s;ome are inti|mately connected, &s;ome more &s;lightly; &s;ome near, &s;ome at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Experience as well as rea&s;on may &s;atisfy us, that the train of mental perceptions is in a great mea&s;ure regulated by the forego|ing relations. Where a number of things are linked together, the idea of any one &s;ug|ge&s;ts the re&s;t; and in this manner is a train of thoughts compo&s;ed. Such is the law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; whether an original law, or whether directed by &s;ome latent principle, is doubtful; and probably will for ever re|main &s;o. This law, however, is not invio|lable. It &s;ometimes happens, though rare|ly, that an idea pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the mind without any connection, &s;o far at lea&s;t as can be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>But though we have not the ab&s;olute command of ideas, yet the Will hath a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="24" REF="31">
influence in directing the order of connected ideas. There are few things but what are connected with many others. By this means, when any thing becomes an object, whether in a direct &s;urvey, or ideal|ly only, it generally &s;ugge&s;ts many of its connections. Among the&s;e a choice is af|forded. We can in&s;i&s;t upon one, rejecting others; and we can even in&s;i&s;t upon what has the &s;lighte&s;t connection. Where ideas are left to their natural cour&s;e, they are ge|nerally continued through the &s;tronge&s;t connections. The mind extends its view to a &s;on more readily than to a &s;ervant, and more readily to a neighbour than to one living at a di&s;tance. This order may be va|ried by Will, but &s;till within the limits of connected objects. In &s;hort, every train of ideas mu&s;t be a chain, in which the parti|cular ideas are linked to each other. We may vary the order of a natural train; but not &s;o as to di&s;&s;olve it altogether, by carry|ing on our thoughts in a loo&s;e manner without any connection. So far doth our power extend; and that power is &s;ufficient for all u&s;eful purpo&s;es. To give us more
<PB N="25" REF="32">
power, would probably be detrimental in|&s;tead of being &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Will is not the only cau&s;e that prevents a train of thought from being continued through the &s;tronge&s;t connections. Much depends on the pre&s;ent tone of mind; for a &s;ubject that accords with this tone is always welcome. Thus, in good &s;pirits, a chear|ful &s;ubject will be introduced by the &s;light|e&s;t connection; and one that is melancho|ly, not le&s;s readily in low &s;pirits. Again, an intere&s;ting &s;ubject is recalled, from time to time, by any connection indifferently, &s;trong or weak. This is finely touched by Shake&s;pear, with relation to a rich cargo at &s;ea.<Q><L>My wind, cooling my broth,</L>
<L>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</L>
<L>What harm a wind too great might do at &s;ea.</L>

<L>But I &s;hould think of &s;hallows and of flats;</L>

<P>Another cau&s;e clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable from that now mentioned, hath al&s;o a con&s;ider|able influence over the train of ideas. In &s;ome minds of a &s;ingular frame, thoughts and circum&s;tances crowd upon each other by the &s;lighte&s;t connection. I a&s;cribe this to a defect in the faculty of di&s;cernment. A per&s;on who cannot accurately di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a &s;light connection and one that is more &s;olid, is equally affected with both. Such a per&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a great command of ideas, becau&s;e they are intro|duced by any relation indifferently; and the &s;lighter relations, being without number, mu&s;t furni&s;h ideas without end. This doc|trine is, in a lively manner, illu&s;trated by Shake&s;pear.<Q><SP>

thy&s;elf and thy money too.

<P>On the other hand, a man of accurate judgement cannot have a great flow of ideas. The &s;lighter relations making no figure in his mind, have no power to introduce ideas. And hence it is, that accurate judgement is not friendly to declamation or copious elo|quence.
<PB N="28" REF="35">
This rea&s;oning is confirmed by ex|perience; for it is a noted ob&s;ervation, That a great or comprehen&s;ive memory is &s;eldom connected with a good judgement.</P>
<P>As an additional confirmation, I appeal to another noted ob&s;ervation, That wit and judgement are &s;eldom united. Wit con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in joining things by di&s;tant and fan|ciful relations, which &s;urpri&s;e becau&s;e they are unexpected. Such relations being of the &s;lighte&s;t kind, readily occur to that per|&s;on only who makes every relation equally welcome. Wit, upon that account, is, in a good mea&s;ure, incompatible with &s;olid judgement; which, neglecting trivial rela|tions, adheres to what are &s;ub&s;tantial and permanent. Thus memory and wit are of|ten conjoined: &s;olid judgement &s;eldom with either.</P>
<P>The train of thought depends not entire|ly upon relations: another cau&s;e comes in for a &s;hare; and that is the &s;en&s;e of order and arrangement. To things of equal rank, where there is no room for a preference, order cannot be applied; and it mu&s;t be in|different in what manner they be &s;urveyed;
<PB N="29" REF="36">
witne&s;s the &s;heep that make a flock, or the trees in a wood. But in things of unequal rank, order is a governing principle. Thus our tendency is, to view the principal &s;ub|ject before we de&s;cend to its acce&s;&s;ories or ornaments, and the &s;uperior before the in|ferior or dependent. We are equally aver&s;e to enter into a minute con&s;ideration of con|&s;tituent parts, till the thing be fir&s;t &s;urveyed as a whole. In pa&s;&s;ing from a part to the whole, and from an acce&s;&s;ory to its princi|pal, the connection is the &s;ame as in the op|po&s;ite direction. But a &s;en&s;e of order aids the tran&s;ition in the latter ca&s;e, and a &s;en&s;e of di&s;order ob&s;tructs it in the former. It needs &s;carce be added, that in thinking or reflecting on any of the&s;e particulars, and in pa&s;&s;ing from one to another ideally, we are &s;en&s;ible of ea&s;ine&s;s or difficulty preci&s;ely as when they are &s;et before our eyes.</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;e of order is con&s;picuous with re&s;pect to natural operations; for it always coincides with the order of nature. Think|ing upon a body in motion, we follow its natural cour&s;e. The mind falls with a hea|vy body, de&s;cends with a river, and a&s;cends
<PB N="30" REF="37">
with flame and &s;moke. In tracing out a fa|mily, we incline to begin at the founder, and to de&s;cend gradually to his late&s;t po&s;te|rity. On the contrary, mu&s;ing on a lofty oak, we begin at the trunk, and mount from it to the branches. As to hi&s;torical facts, we love to proceed in the order of time; or, which comes to the &s;ame, to proceed along the chain of cau&s;es and ef|fects.</P>
<P>But though, in following out a hi&s;torical chain, our bent is to proceed orderly from cau&s;es to their effects, we find not the &s;ame bent in matters of &s;cience. There we &s;eem rather di&s;po&s;ed to proceed from effects to their cau&s;es, and from particular propo&s;i|tions to tho&s;e which are more general. Why this difference in matters that appear &s;o nearly related? The ca&s;es are &s;imilar in appearance only, not in reality. In a hi&s;to|rical chain, every event is particular, the effect of &s;ome former event, and the cau&s;e of others that follow. In &s;uch a chain, there is nothing to bias the mind from the order of nature. Widely different is the ca&s;e of &s;cience, when we endeavour to trace out
<PB N="31" REF="38">
cau&s;es and their effects. Many experiments are commonly reduced under one cau&s;e; and again, many of the&s;e under &s;ome one &s;till more general and comprehen&s;ive. In our progre&s;s from particular effects to gene|ral cau&s;es, and from particular propo&s;itions to the more comprehen&s;ive, we feel a gra|dual dilatation or expan&s;ion of mind, like what is felt in proceeding along an a&s;cend|ing &s;eries, which is extremely delightful. The plea&s;ure here exceeds what ari&s;es from &s;ollowing the cour&s;e of nature; and it is this plea&s;ure which regulates our train of thought in the ca&s;e now mentioned, and in others that are &s;imilar. The&s;e ob&s;ervations, by the way, furni&s;h materials for in&s;tituting a compari&s;on betwixt the &s;ynthetic and ana|lytic methods of rea&s;oning. The &s;ynthetic method de&s;cending regularly from princi|ples to their con&s;equences, is more agree|able to the &s;trictne&s;s of order. But in fol|lowing the oppo&s;ite cour&s;e in the analytic method, we have a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, like mounting upward, which is not felt in the other. The analytic method is more agree|able to the imagination. The other method
<PB N="32" REF="39">
will be preferred by tho&s;e only who with rigidity adhere to order, and give no indul|gence to natural emotions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A train of perceptions or ideas, with re&s;pect to its uni|formity and variety, is handled afterward, chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears then that we are framed by na|ture to reli&s;h order and connection. When an object is introduced by a proper connec|tion, we are con&s;cious of a certain plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from that circum&s;tance. Among objects of equal rank, the plea&s;ure is pro|portioned to the degree of connection; but among unequal objects, where we require a certain order, the plea&s;ure ari&s;es chiefly from an orderly arrangement. Of this one may be made &s;en&s;ible, in tracing objects contrary to the cour&s;e of nature, or contra|ry to our &s;en&s;e of order. The mind pro|ceeds with alacrity from a whole to its parts, and from a principal to its acce&s;&s;ories; but in the contrary direction, it is &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ort of retrograde motion, which is unplea|&s;ant. And here may be remarked the great influence of order upon the mind of man. Grandeur, which makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="33" REF="40">
inclines us, in running over any &s;eries, to proceed from &s;mall to great, rather than from great to &s;mall. But order prevails over this tendency; and in pa&s;&s;ing from the whole to its parts, and from a &s;ubject to its ornaments, affords plea&s;ure as well as facility, which are not felt in the oppo&s;ite cour&s;e. Elevation touches the mind not le&s;s than grandeur doth; and in rai&s;ing the mind to elevated objects, there is a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure. But the cour&s;e of nature hath &s;till a greater influence than elevation; and therefore the plea&s;ure of falling with rain, and de&s;cending gradual|ly with a river, prevails over that of mount|ing upward. Hence the agreeablene&s;s of &s;moke a&s;cending in a calm morning. Ele|vation concurs with the cour&s;e of nature, to make this object delightful.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;gu&s;t men generally have at ab&s;tract &s;peclation; and for that rea&s;on I would avoid it altogether, were it po&s;&s;ible in a work which profe&s;&s;es to draw the rules of critici&s;m from human na|ture, their true &s;ource. There is indeed no choice, other than to continue for &s;ome
<PB N="34" REF="41">
time in the &s;ame track, or to abandon the undertaking altogether. Candor obliges me to notify this to my readers, that &s;uch of them who&s;e aver&s;ion to ab&s;tract &s;peculation is invincible, may &s;top &s;hort here; for till principles be explained, I can promi&s;e no entertainment to tho&s;e who &s;hun thinking. But I flatter my&s;elf with a different ta&s;te in the bulk of readers. Some few, I imagine, will reli&s;h the ab&s;tract part for its own &s;ake; and many for the u&s;eful purpo&s;es to which it may be applied. For encouraging the latter to proceed with alacrity, I a&s;&s;ure them beforehand that the foregoing &s;peculation leads to many important rules of critici&s;m, which &s;hall be unfolded in the cour&s;e of this work. In the mean time, for in&s;tant &s;atisfaction in part, they will be plea&s;ed to accept the following &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>It is required in every work of art, that, like an organic &s;y&s;tem, the con&s;tituent parts be mutually connected, and bear each of them a relation to the whole, &s;ome more intimate, &s;ome le&s;s, according to their de&s;ti|nation. Order is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than con|nection; and when due regard is paid to
<PB N="35" REF="42">
the&s;e, we have a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;t compo&s;ition, and &s;o far are plea&s;ed with the performance. Homer is defective in order and connection; and Pindar more remarkably. Regularity, order, and connection, are painful re&s;traints on a bold and fertile imagination; and are not patiently &s;ubmitted to, but after much culture and di&s;cipline. In Horace there is no fault more eminent than want of con|nection. In&s;tances are without number. In the fir&s;t fourteen lines of ode 7. lib. 1. he mentions &s;everal towns and di&s;tricts which by &s;ome were reli&s;hed more than by others. In the remainder of the ode, Plancus is ex|horted to drown his cares in wine. Having narrowly e&s;caped death by the fall of a tree, this poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. ode 13.</NOTE> takes occa&s;ion properly to ob|&s;erve, that while we guard again&s;t &s;ome dangers, we are expo&s;ed to others we can|not fore&s;ee. He ends with di&s;playing the power of mu&s;ic. The parts of ode 16. lib. 2. are &s;o loo&s;ely connected as to disfigure a poem otherwi&s;e extremely beautiful. The 1&s;t, 2d, 3d, 4th, 11th, 24th, 27th odes of the
<PB N="36" REF="43">
3d book, lie open all of them to the &s;ame cen|&s;ure. The 1&s;t &s;atire, book 1. is &s;o deformed by want of unity and connection of parts, as upon the whole to be &s;carce agreeable. It commences with an important que&s;tion, How it happens that per&s;ons who are &s;o much &s;atisfied with them&s;elves, are generally &s;o little with their condition? After illu&s;tra|ting the ob&s;ervation in a &s;prightly manner by &s;everal examples, the author, forgetting his &s;ubject, enters upon a declamation a|gain&s;t avarice, which he pur&s;ues till the line 108. There he makes an apology for wandering, and promi&s;es to return to his &s;ubject. But avarice having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, he follows out that theme to the end, and never returns to the que|&s;tion propo&s;ed in the beginning.</P>
<P>In the Georgies of Virgil, though e|&s;teemed the mo&s;t fini&s;hed work of that author, the parts are ill connected, and the tran&s;itions far from being &s;weet and ea&s;y. In the fir&s;t book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lin. 231.</NOTE> he deviates from his &s;ubject to give a de&s;cription of the five

zones. The want of connection here is remarkable, as well as in the de&s;cription of the prodigies that accompanied the death of Cae&s;ar, with which the &s;ame book is con|cluded. A digre&s;&s;ion upon the prai&s;es of Italy in the &s;econd book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lin. 136.</NOTE>, is not more happily introduced. And in the mid&s;t of a declamation upon the plea&s;ures of hu&s;|bandry, that makes part of the &s;ame book<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lin. 475.</NOTE>, the author appears per&s;onally upon the &s;tage without the &s;lighte&s;t connection. The two prefaces of Sallu&s;t look as if they had been prefixed by &s;ome blunder to his two hi&s;tories. They will &s;uit any other hi&s;tory as well, or any &s;ubject as well as hi&s;tory. Even the members of the&s;e prefaces are but loo&s;ely connected. They look more like a number of maxims or ob&s;ervations than a connected di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>An epi&s;ode in a narrative poem being in effect an acce&s;&s;ory, demands not that &s;trict union with the principal &s;ubject which is requi&s;ite betwixt a whole and its con&s;ti|tuent parts. The relation however of prin|cipal

and acce&s;&s;ory being pretty intimate, an epi&s;ode loo&s;ely connected with the prin|cipal &s;ubject will never be graceful. I give for an example the de&s;cent of Aeneas into hell, which employs the &s;ixth book of the Aeneid. The reader is not prepared for this important event. No cau&s;e is a&s;&s;igned, that can make it appear nece&s;&s;ary or even natural, to &s;u&s;pend, for &s;o long a time, the principal action in its mo&s;t intere&s;ting pe|riod. To engage Aeneas to wander from his cour&s;e in &s;earch of an adventure &s;o ex|traordinary, the poet can find no better pretext, than the hero's longing to vi&s;it the gho&s;t of his father recently dead. In the mean time the &s;tory is interrupted, and the reader lo&s;es his ardor. An epi&s;ode &s;o ex|tremely beautiful is not at any rate to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. It is pity however, that it doth not ari&s;e more naturally from the &s;ub|ject. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve at the &s;ame time, that full ju&s;tice is done to this incident, by con|&s;idering it to be an epi&s;ode; for if it be a con&s;tituent part of the principal action, the connection ought to be &s;till more intimate. The &s;ame objection lies again&s;t that elabo|rate

de&s;cription of Fame in the Aeneid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. lin. 173.</NOTE>. Any other book of that heroic poem, or of any heroic poem, has as good a title to that de&s;cription as the book where it is placed.</P>
<P>In a natural land&s;cape, we every day per|ceive a multitude of objects connected by contiguity &s;olely.

For it is a known fact, the rea|&s;on of which is &s;ugge&s;ted above, that it is ea&s;ier by words to introduce into the mind a related object, than one which is not con|nected with the preceding train.

But it is not &s;ufficient for the conduct of life that our actions be linked together, however intimately: it is be&s;ide nece&s;&s;ary that they proceed in a certain or|der; and this al&s;o is provided for by an o|riginal propen&s;ity. Thus order and con|nection, while they admit &s;ufficient variety, introduce a method in the management of affairs.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Emotions and Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>THE fine arts, as ob&s;erved above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction.</NOTE>, are all of them calculated to give plea&s;ure to the eye or the ear; and they never de&s;cend to gratify the ta&s;te, touch, or &s;mell. At the &s;ame time, the feelings of the eye and ear, are of all the feelings of external &s;en&s;e, tho&s;e only which are honoured with the name of <HI>emotions</HI> or <HI>pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> It is al&s;o ob&s;erved above<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Introduction.</NOTE>, that the principles of the fine arts are un|folded by &s;tudying the &s;en&s;itive part of hu|man nature, in order to know what objects of the eye and ear are agreeable, what di&s;|agreeable. The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;how the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent chapter. We evidently mu&s;t be acquainted with the nature and cau|&s;es of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions, before we can judge with any accuracy how far they are
<PB N="43" REF="54">
under the power of the fine arts. The cri|tical art is thus &s;et in a fine point of view. The inqui&s;itive mind beginning with cri|tici&s;m the mo&s;t agreeable of all amu&s;e|ments, and finding no ob&s;truction in its progre&s;s, advances far into the &s;en&s;itive part of our nature; and gains in&s;en&s;ibly a thorough knowledge of the human heart, of its de&s;ires, and of every motive to action; a &s;cience which of all that can be reached by man, is to him of the greate&s;t import|ance.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;ubject &s;o exten&s;ive, all that can be expected here, is a general or &s;light &s;ur|vey. Some emotions indeed more pecu|liarly connected with the fine arts, I pro|po&s;e to handle in &s;eparate chapters; a me|thod that will &s;horten the general &s;urvey con&s;iderably. And yet, after this circum|&s;cription, &s;o much matter comes under even a general view of the pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, that, to avoid confu&s;ion, I find it nece&s;&s;ary to divide this chapter into many parts: in the fir&s;t of which are handled the cau&s;es of tho&s;e emotions and pa&s;&s;ions that are the mo&s;t common and familiar; for to ex|plain
<PB N="44" REF="55">
every pa&s;&s;ion and emotion, however &s;ingular, would be an endle&s;s work. And though I could not well take up le&s;s ground, without &s;eparating things intimately con|nected; yet, upon examination, I find the cau&s;es of our emotions and pa&s;&s;ions to be &s;o numerous and various, as to make a &s;ub|divi&s;ion al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary by &s;plitting this fir&s;t part into &s;everal &s;ections. Human nature is a complicated machine, and mu&s;t be &s;o to an&s;wer all its purpo&s;es. There have indeed been publi&s;hed to the world, many a &s;y&s;tem of human nature, that flatter the mind by their &s;implicity. But the&s;e, unluckily, deviate far from truth and reality. According to &s;ome writers, man is entirely a &s;elfi&s;h being: according to others, univer&s;al benevolence is his duty. One founds morality upon &s;ym|pathy &s;olely, and one upon utility. If any of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems were of nature's produc|tion, the pre&s;ent &s;ubject might be &s;oon di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. But the variety of nature is not &s;o ea&s;ily reached; and for confuting &s;uch Utopian &s;y&s;tems without the intricacy of rea&s;oning, it appears the be&s;t method to
<PB N="45" REF="56">
enter into human nature, and to &s;et before the eye, plainly and candidly, facts as they really exi&s;t.</P>

<P>THe&s;e branches are &s;o interwoven, as to make it nece&s;&s;ary that they be handled together. It is a fact univer&s;ally admitted, that no emotion nor pa&s;&s;ion ever &s;tarts up in the mind, without a known cau&s;e. If I love a per&s;on, it is for good qualities or good offices: if I have re&s;ent|ment again&s;t a man, it mu&s;t be for &s;ome injury he has done me; and I cannot pity any one, who is under no di&s;tre&s;s of body or of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="57">
The circum&s;tances now mentioned, if they cau&s;e or occa&s;ion a pa&s;&s;ion, cannot be entirely indifferent: if they were, they could not move us in any degree. And we find upon examination, that they are not indiffer|ent. Looking back upon the foregoing examples, the good qualities or good offi|ces that attract my love, are antecedently agreeable. If an injury were not di&s;agree|able, it would not occa&s;ion any re&s;entment again&s;t the author; nor would the pa&s;&s;ion of pity be rai&s;ed by an object in di&s;tre&s;s, if that object did not give us pain. The&s;e feelings antecedent to pa&s;&s;ion, and which &s;eem to be the cau&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>emotions.</HI></P>
<P>What is now &s;aid about the production of pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;olves into a very &s;imple propo&s;i|tion, That we love what is plea&s;ant, and hate what is painful. And indeed it is evi|dent, that without antecedent emotions we could not have any pa&s;&s;ions; for a thing mu&s;t be plea&s;ant or painful, before it can be the object either of love or of hatred.</P>
<P>As it appears from this &s;hort &s;ketch, that pa&s;&s;ions are generated by means of prior e|motions,
<PB N="47" REF="58">
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take fir&s;t under con&s;ideration emotions and their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Such is the con&s;titution of our nature, that upon perceiving certain external objects, we are in&s;tantaneou&s;ly con&s;cious of plea&s;ure or pain. A flowing river, a &s;mooth extend|ed plain, a &s;preading oak, a towering hill, are objects of &s;ight that rai&s;e plea&s;ant emo|tions. A barren heath, a dirty mar&s;h, a rotten carca&s;s, rai&s;e painful emotions. Of the emotions thus produced, we inquire for no other cau&s;e but merely the pre&s;ence of the object.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t further be ob&s;erved, that the things now mentioned, rai&s;e emotions by means of their properties and qualities. To the emotion rai&s;ed by a large river, its &s;ize, its force, and its fluency, contribute each a &s;hare. The plea&s;ures of regularity, pro|priety, convenience, compo&s;e the emotion rai&s;ed by a fine building.</P>
<P>If external properties make a being or thing agreeable, we have rea&s;on to expect the &s;ame effect from tho&s;e which are inter|nal; and accordingly power, di&s;cernment,
<PB N="48" REF="59">
wit, mildne&s;s, &s;ympathy, courage, bene|volence, render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or agreeable in a high degree. So &s;oon as the&s;e qualities are perceived in any per&s;on, we in&s;tantaneou&s;ly feel plea&s;ant emotions, without the &s;lighte&s;t act of reflection or of attention to con&s;equen|ces. It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that certain qualities oppo&s;ite to the former, &s;uch as dullne&s;s, peevi&s;hne&s;s, inhumanity, coward|ice, occa&s;ion in the &s;ame manner painful emotions.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible beings affect us remarkably by their actions. Some actions &s;o &s;oon as per|ceived, rai&s;e plea&s;ant emotions in the &s;pec|tator, without the lea&s;t reflection; &s;uch as graceful motion and genteel behaviour. But as the intention of the agent is a capital circum&s;tance in the bulk of human actions, it requires reflection to di&s;cover their true character. If I &s;ee one delivering a pur&s;e of money to another, I can make nothing of this action, till I di&s;cover with what in|tention the money is given. If it be given to extingui&s;h a debt, the action is agreeable in a &s;light degree. If it be a grateful return, I feel a &s;tronger emotion; and the plea|&s;urable
<PB N="49" REF="60">
emotion ri&s;es to a great height when it is the intention of the giver to re|lieve a virtuous family from want. Actions are thus qualified by the intention of the a|gent. But they are not qualified by the e|vent; for an action well intended is agree|able, whatever be the con&s;equence. The plea&s;ant or painful emotion that ari&s;eth from contemplating human actions, is of a pecu|liar kind. Human actions are perceived to be <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI>; and this perception qua|lifies the plea&s;ure or pain that re&s;ults from them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In tracing our emotions and pa&s;&s;ions to their origin, it once was my opinion, that qualities and actions are the prima|ry cau&s;es of emotions; and that the&s;e emotions are afterward expanded upon the being to which the&s;e qualities and actions belong. But I have di&s;covered that opinion to be erroneous. An attribute is not, even in imagination, &s;eparable from the being to which it belongs; and for that rea&s;on, cannot of it|&s;elf be the cau&s;e of any emotion. We have, it is true, no knowledge of any being or &s;ub&s;tance but by means of its attri|butes; and therefore no being can be agreeable to us otherwi&s;e than by their means. But &s;till, when an emotion is rai&s;ed, it is the being it&s;elf, as we apprehend the matter, which rai&s;es the emotion; and it rai&s;es it by means of one or other of its attributes. If it be urged, That we can in idea ab&s;tract a qua|lity from the thing to which it belongs; it might be an&s;wered, That an ab&s;tract idea, which &s;erves excellently the purpo&s;es of rea&s;oning, is too faint and too much &s;trained to produce any &s;ort of emotion. But it is &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to an&s;wer, That the eye never ab&s;tracts. By this organ we per|ceive things as they really exi&s;t, and never perceive a quality as &s;eparated from the &s;ubject. Hence it mu&s;t be evident, that emotions are rai&s;ed, not by qualities ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, but by the &s;ub&s;tance or body &s;o and &s;o qualified. Thus a &s;pread|ing oak rai&s;es a plea&s;ant emotion, by means of its colour, fi|gure, umbrage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not the colour &s;trictly &s;peaking that produces the emotion, but the tree as coloured: it is not the figure ab&s;tractly con&s;idered that produces the emotion, but the tree con&s;idered as of a certain figure. And hence by the way it appears, that the beauty of &s;uch an object is complex, re&s;olvable into &s;everal beauties more &s;imple.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61">
Not only are emotions rai&s;ed in us by the qualities and actions of others, but al&s;o by their feelings. I cannot behold a man in di&s;tre&s;s, without partaking of his pain; nor in joy, without partaking of his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The beings or things above de&s;cribed, occa&s;ion emotions in us, not only in the ori|ginal &s;urvey, but when they are recalled to the memory in idea. A field laid out with ta&s;te, is plea&s;ant in the recollection, as well as when under our eye. A generous ac|tion de&s;cribed in words or colours, occa&s;ions a &s;en&s;ible emotion, as well as when we &s;ee
<PB N="51" REF="62">
it performed. And when we reflect upon the di&s;tre&s;s of any per&s;on, our pain is of the &s;ame kind with what we felt when eye|witne&s;&s;es. In a word, an agreeable or di&s;|agreeable object recalled to the mind in idea, is the occa&s;ion of a plea&s;ant or painful emotion, of the &s;ame kind with that pro|duced when the object was pre&s;ent. The only difference is, that an idea being fainter than an original perception, the plea&s;ure or pain produced by the former, is proportion|ably fainter than that produced by the latter.</P>
<P>Having explained the nature of an emo|tion and mentioned &s;everal cau&s;es by which it is produced, we proceed to an ob&s;ervation of con&s;iderable importance in the &s;cience of human nature, that &s;ome emotions are ac|companied with de&s;ire, and that others, af|ter a &s;hort exi&s;tence, pa&s;s away without pro|ducing de&s;ire of any &s;ort. The emotion rai&s;ed by a fine land&s;cape or a magnificent building, vani&s;heth generally without at|taching our hearts to the object; which al|&s;o happens with relation to a number of fine faces in a crowded a&s;&s;embly. But the bulk of emotions are accompanied with de&s;ire of
<PB N="52" REF="63">
one &s;ort or other, provided only a fit ob|ject for de&s;ire be &s;ugge&s;ted. This is re|markably the ca&s;e of emotions rai&s;ed by hu|man actions and qualities. A virtuous ac|tion rai&s;eth in every &s;pectator a plea&s;ant e|motion, which is generally attended with a de&s;ire to do good to the author of the action. A vicious action, on the other hand, pro|duceth a painful emotion; and of con&s;e|quence a de&s;ire to have the author puni&s;h|ed. Even things inanimate often rai&s;e de|&s;ire. The goods of fortune are objects of de&s;ire almo&s;t univer&s;ally; and the de&s;ire, when more than commonly vigorous, ob|tains the name of <HI>avarice.</HI> The plea&s;ant emotion produced in a &s;pectator by a capital picture in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a prince, &s;eldom rai&s;eth de&s;ire. But if &s;uch a picture be ex|po&s;ed to &s;ale, de&s;ire of having or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing is the natural con&s;equence of the emotion.</P>
<P>If now an emotion be &s;ometimes pro|ductive of de&s;ire, &s;omtimes not, it comes to be a material inquiry, in what re&s;pect a pa&s;&s;ion differs from an emotion. Is pa&s;&s;ion in its nature or feeling di&s;tingui&s;hable from emotion? I have been apt to think that
<PB N="53" REF="64">
there mu&s;t be a di&s;tinction, when the emo|tion &s;eems in all ca&s;es to precede the pa&s;&s;ion, and to be the cau&s;e or occa&s;ion of it. But after the &s;tricte&s;t examination, I cannot perceive any &s;uch di&s;tinction betwixt emo|tion and pa&s;&s;ion. What is love to a mi|&s;tre&s;s, for example, but a plea&s;ant emotion rai&s;ed by a &s;ight or idea of the per&s;on belo|ved, joined with de&s;ire of enjoyment? In what el&s;e con&s;i&s;ts the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, but in a painful emotion occa&s;ioned by the injury, accompanied with de&s;ire to cha&s;ti&s;e the author of the injury? In general, as to every &s;ort of pa&s;&s;ion, we find no more in the compo&s;ition, but the particulars now men|tioned, an emotion plea&s;ant or painful ac|companied with de&s;ire. What then &s;hall we &s;ay upon this &s;ubject? Are <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>emotion</HI> &s;ynonymous terms? This cannot be averred. No feeling nor agitation of the mind void of de&s;ire, is termed a pa&s;&s;ion; and we have di&s;covered that there are ma|ny emotions which pa&s;s away without rai|&s;ing de&s;ire of any kind. How is the diffi|culty to be &s;olved? There appears to me but one &s;olution, which I reli&s;h the more,
<PB N="54" REF="65">
as it renders the doctrine of the pa&s;&s;ions and emotions &s;imple and per&s;picuous. The &s;o|lution follows. An internal motion or agi|tation of the mind, when it pa&s;&s;eth away without rai&s;ing de&s;ire, is denominated <HI>an emotion:</HI> when de&s;ire is rai&s;ed, the mo|tion or agitation is denominated <HI>a pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> A fine face, for example, rai&s;eth in me a plea&s;ant feeling. If this feeling vani&s;h without producing any effect, it is in proper language an emotion. But if &s;uch feeling, by reiterated views of the object, become &s;ufficiently &s;trong to rai&s;e de&s;ire, it is no longer termed an emotion, but a pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame holds in all the other pa&s;&s;ions. The painful feeling rai&s;ed in a &s;pectator by a &s;light injury done to a &s;tranger, being ac|companied with no de&s;ire of revenge, is termed an emotion. But this injury rai&s;eth in the &s;tranger a &s;tronger emotion, which being accompanied with de&s;ire of revenge, is a pa&s;&s;ion. Again, external expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;tre&s;s, produce in the &s;pectator a pain|ful feeling. This feeling is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;light as to pa&s;s away without any effect, in which ca&s;e it is an emotion. But if the

feeling be &s;o &s;trong as to prompt de&s;ire of affording relief, it is a pa&s;&s;ion, and is termed <HI>pity.</HI> Envy is emulation in exce&s;s. If the exaltation of a competitor be barely di&s;a|greeable, the painful feeling is reckoned an emotion. If it produce de&s;ire to depre&s;s him, it is reckoned a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To prevent mi&s;takes, it mu&s;t be ob&s;er|ved, that de&s;ire here is taken in its proper &s;en&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that internal impul&s;e which makes us proceed to action. De&s;ire in a lax &s;en&s;e re&s;pects al&s;o actions and events that depend not on us, as when I de&s;ire that my friend may have a &s;on to repre&s;ent him, or that my country may flouri&s;h in arts and &s;ciences. But &s;uch internal act is more properly termed a <HI>wi&s;h</HI> than a <HI>de&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P>Having di&s;tingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion from emo|tion, we proceed to con&s;ider pa&s;&s;ion more at large, with re&s;pect e&s;pecially to its power of producing action.</P>
<P>We have daily and con&s;tant experience for our authority, that no man ever pro|ceeds to action but through the impul&s;e of &s;ome antecedent de&s;ire. So well e&s;tabli&s;hed is this ob&s;ervation, and &s;o deeply rooted in
<PB N="56" REF="67">
the mind, that we can &s;carce imagine a different &s;y&s;tem of action. Even a child will &s;ay familiarly, What &s;hould make me do this or that when I have no inclination to it? Taking it then for granted, that the exi&s;tence of action depends on antecedent de&s;ire; it follows, that where there is no de&s;ire there can be no action. This opens another &s;hining di&s;tinction betwixt emotions and pa&s;&s;ions. The former, being without de&s;ire, are in their nature quie&s;cent: the latter, involving de&s;ire, have a tendency to action, and always produce action where they meet with no ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that every pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have an object, <HI>viz.</HI> that being or thing to which our de&s;ire is directed, and with a view to which every action prompted by that de&s;ire is performed. The object of every pa&s;&s;ion is that being or thing which produced it. This will be evident from induction. A fine woman, by her beauty, cau&s;es in me the pa&s;&s;ion of love, which is directed upon her as its object. A man by injuring me, rai&s;es my re&s;entment; and becomes thereby the object of my re&s;ent|ment.
<PB N="57" REF="68">
Thus the cau&s;e of a pa&s;&s;ion, and its object, are the &s;ame in different views. An emotion, on the other hand, being in its nature quie&s;cent and merely a pa&s;&s;ive feeling, mu&s;t have a cau&s;e; but can|not be &s;aid properly &s;peaking to have an object.</P>
<P>As the de&s;ire involved in every pa&s;&s;ion leads to action, this action is either ultimate, or it is done as a means to &s;ome end. Where the action is ultimate, rea&s;on and reflection bear no part. The action is per|formed blindly by the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, without any view. Thus one in extreme hunger &s;natches at food, without the &s;lighte&s;t reflection whether it be &s;alutary or not: Avarice prompts to accumulate wealth without the lea&s;t view of u&s;e; and thereby ab&s;urdly converts means into an end: Fear often makes us fly before we reflect whe|ther we really be in danger: and animal love not le&s;s often hurries to fruition, with|out a &s;ingle thought of gratification. But for the mo&s;t part, actions are performed as means to &s;ome end; and in the&s;e actions rea&s;on and reflection always bear a part.
<PB N="58" REF="69">
The end is that event which is de&s;ired; and the action is deliberately performed in order to bring about that end. Thus affec|tion to my friend involves a de&s;ire to make him happy; and the de&s;ire to accompli&s;h that end, prompts me to perform what I judge will contribute to it.</P>
<P>Where the action is ultimate, it hath a cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the impul&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion. But we cannot properly &s;ay it hath a motive. This term is appropriated to actions that are performed as means to &s;ome end; and the conviction that the action will tend to bring about the end de&s;ired, is termed a motive. Thus pa&s;&s;ions con&s;idered as cau|&s;es of action, are di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds; in&s;tinctive, and deliberative. The fir&s;t operating blindly and by mere impul&s;e, depend entirely upon the &s;en&s;itive part of our nature. The other operating by reflec|tion and by motives, are connected with the rational part.</P>
<P>The foregoing difference among the pa&s;|&s;ions, is the work of nature. Experience brings on &s;ome variations. By all actions per|formed through the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, de|&s;ire
<PB N="59" REF="70">
is gratified, and the gratification is plea|&s;ant. This le&s;&s;on we have from experience. And hence it is, that after an action has often been performed by the impul&s;e merely of pa&s;&s;ion, the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from per|formance, con&s;idered beforehand, becomes a motive, which joins its force with the o|riginal impul&s;e in determining us to act. Thus a child eats by the mere impul&s;e of hunger: a young man thinks of the plea|&s;ure of gratification, which is a motive for him to eat: and a man farther advanced in life, hath the additional motive that it will contribute to his health.</P>
<P>In&s;tinctive pa&s;&s;ions are di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds. Where the cau&s;e is internal, they are denominated <HI>appetites:</HI> where ex|ternal, they retain the common name of <HI>pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Thus hunger, thir&s;t, animal love, are termed <HI>appetites</HI>; while fear and anger, even when they operate blindly and by mere impul&s;e, are termed <HI>pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>From the definition of a motive above given, it is ea&s;y to determine, with the greate&s;t accuracy, what pa&s;&s;ions are &s;elfi&s;h, what &s;ocial. No pa&s;&s;ion can properly be
<PB N="60" REF="71">
termed &s;elfi&s;h, but what prompts me to exert actions in order for my own good; nor &s;ocial, but what prompts me to exert actions in order for the good of another. The motive is that which determines a pa&s;&s;ion to be &s;ocial or &s;elfi&s;h. Hence it follows, that our appetites, which make us act blindly and by mere impul&s;e, cannot be reckoned either &s;ocial or &s;elfi&s;h; and as little the actions they produce. Thus eat|ing, when prompted by an impul&s;e merely of nature, is neither &s;ocial nor &s;elfi&s;h. But add a motive, That it will contribute to my plea&s;ure or my health, and it becomes in a mea&s;ure &s;elfi&s;h. On the other hand, when affection moves me to exert actions to the end &s;olely of advancing my friend's happi|ne&s;s, without the &s;lighte&s;t regard to my own gratification, &s;uch actions are ju&s;tly denominated <HI>&s;ocial</HI>; and &s;o is the affection that is their cau&s;e. If another motive be added, That gratifying the affection will contribute to my own happine&s;s, the ac|tions I perform become partly &s;elfi&s;h. A|nimal love when exerted into action by na|tural impul&s;e &s;ingly, is neither &s;ocial nor &s;elfi&s;h: when exerted with a view to gra|tification
<PB N="61" REF="72">
and in order to make me happy, it is &s;elfi&s;h. When the motive of giving plea&s;ure to its object is &s;uperadded, it is partly &s;ocial, partly &s;elfi&s;h. A ju&s;t action when prompted by the love of ju&s;tice &s;ole|ly, is neither &s;ocial nor &s;elfi&s;h. When I perform an act of ju&s;tice with a view to the plea&s;ure of gratification, the action is &s;elfi&s;h. I pay my debt for my own &s;ake, not with a view to benefit my creditor. But let me &s;uppo&s;e the money has been ad|vanced by a friend without intere&s;t, purely to oblige me. In this ca&s;e, together with the inclination to do ju&s;tice, there ari&s;es a motive of gratitude, which re&s;pects the cre|ditor &s;olely, and prompts me to act in or|der to do him good. Here the action is partly &s;ocial, partly &s;elfi&s;h. Suppo&s;e again I meet with a &s;urpri&s;ing and unexpected act of genero&s;ity, that in&s;pires me with love to my benefactor and the utmo&s;t gratitude. I burn to do him good: he is the &s;ole object of my de&s;ire; and my own plea&s;ure in gra|tifying the de&s;ire, vani&s;heth out of &s;ight. In this ca&s;e, the action I perform is purely &s;o|cial. Thus it happens, that when a &s;ocial motive becomes &s;trong, the action is ex|erted
<PB N="62" REF="73">
with a view &s;ingly to the object of the pa&s;&s;ion; and the &s;elfi&s;h plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from gratification is never once con&s;idered. The &s;ame effect of &s;tifling &s;elfi&s;h motives, is equally remarkable in other pa&s;&s;ions that are in no view &s;ocial. Ambition, for ex|ample, when confined to exaltation as its ultimate end, is neither &s;ocial nor &s;elfi&s;h. Let exaltation be con&s;idered as a means to make me happy, and the pa&s;&s;ion becomes &s;o far &s;elfi&s;h. But if the de&s;ire of exalta|tion wax &s;trong and inflame my mind, the &s;elfi&s;h motive now mentioned is no longer felt. A &s;light degree of re&s;entment, where my chief view in acting is the plea&s;ure a|ri&s;ing to my&s;elf from gratifying the pa&s;&s;ion, is ju&s;tly denominated <HI>&s;elfi&s;h.</HI> Where re|venge flames &s;o high as to have no other aim but the de&s;truction of its object, it is no longer &s;elfi&s;h. In oppo&s;ition to a &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion, it may be termed <HI>di&s;&s;ocial</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When this analy&s;is of human nature is con&s;idered, not one article of which can with any &s;hadow of truth be contro|verted, I cannot help being &s;urpri&s;ed at the blindne&s;s of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who, by dark and confu&s;ed notions, are led to deny all motives to action but what ari&s;e from &s;elf-love. Man, for ought appears, might po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;o framed, as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of no pa&s;&s;ions but what have &s;elf for their object. But man thus framed, would be ill fitted for &s;ociety. Much better is the matter ordered, by enduing him with pa&s;|&s;ions directed entirely to the good of others, as well as with pa&s;&s;ions directed entirely to his own good.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="74">
Of &s;elf, every one hath a direct percep|tion: of other things, we have no know|ledge but by means of their attributes. Hence it is, that of &s;elf, the perception is more lively than of any other thing. Self is an agreeable object; and, for the rea&s;on now given, mu&s;t be more agreeable than any o|ther object. Is not this &s;ufficient to account for the prevalence of &s;elf-love?</P>
<P>In the foregoing part of this chapter, it is &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;ome circum&s;tances make beings or things fit objects for de&s;ire, others not. This hint mu&s;t be pur&s;ued. It is a truth a&s;certained by univer&s;al experience, that a thing which in our apprehen&s;ion is beyond reach, never is the object of de&s;ire. No man, in his right &s;en&s;es, de&s;ires to walk in the air, or to de&s;cend to the centre of the earth. We may amu&s;e our&s;elves in a re|verie, with building ca&s;tles in the air, and
<PB N="64" REF="75">
wi&s;hing for what can never happen. But &s;uch things never move de&s;ire. And in|deed a de&s;ire to act would be altogether ab|&s;urd, when we are con&s;cious that the action is beyond our power. In the next place, though the difficulty of attainment with re|&s;pect to things within reach, often inflames de&s;ire; yet where the pro&s;pect of attain|ment is faint and the event extremely un|certain, the object, however agreeable, &s;el|dom rai&s;eth any &s;trong de&s;ire. Thus beau|ty or other good qualities in a woman of rank, &s;eldom rai&s;es love in any man greatly her in&s;erior. In the third place, different objects, equally within reach, rai&s;e emo|tions in different degrees; and when de&s;ire accompanies any of the&s;e emotions, its &s;trength, as is natural, is proportioned to that of its cau&s;e. Hence the remarkable difference among de&s;ires directed upon be|ings inanimate, animate, and rational. The emotion cau&s;ed by a rational being, is out of mea&s;ure &s;tronger than any cau&s;ed by an ani|mal without rea&s;on; and an emotion rai&s;ed by &s;uch an animal, is &s;tronger than what is cau&s;ed by any thing inanimate. There is a
<PB N="65" REF="76">
&s;eparate rea&s;on why de&s;ire of which a ra|tional being is the object &s;hould be the &s;tronge&s;t. De&s;ire directed upon &s;uch a be|ing, is gratified many ways, by loving, &s;er|ving, benefiting, the object; and it is a well known truth, that our de&s;ires naturally &s;well by exerci&s;e. De&s;ire directed upon an in|animate being, &s;u&s;ceptible neither of plea&s;ure nor pain, is not capable of a higher gratifi|cation than that of acquiring the property. Hence it is, that though every feeling which rai&s;eth de&s;ire, is &s;trictly &s;peaking a pa&s;&s;ion; yet commonly tho&s;e feelings only are deno|minated pa&s;&s;ions of which &s;en&s;ible beings capable of plea&s;ure and pain are the objects.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Cau&s;es of the emotions of joy and &s;orrow.</HEAD>
<P>THis &s;ubject was purpo&s;ely re&s;erved for a &s;eparate &s;ection, becau&s;e it could not, with per&s;picuity, be handled under the ge|neral head. An emotion involving de&s;ire is termed <HI>a pa&s;&s;ion</HI>; and when the de&s;ire is
<PB N="66" REF="77">
fulfilled, the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;aid to be gratified. The gratification of every pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be plea&s;ant, or in other words produce a plea|&s;ant emotion; for nothing can be more na|tural, than that the accompli&s;hment of any wi&s;h or de&s;ire &s;hould affect us with joy. I cannot even except the ca&s;e, where a man, through remor&s;e, is de&s;irous to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h him&s;elf. The joy of gratification is properly called an emotion; becau&s;e it makes us happy in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and is ul|timate in its nature, not having a tendency to any thing beyond. On the other hand, &s;orrow mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of an event con|trary to what we de&s;ire; for if the accom|pli&s;hment of de&s;ire produce joy, it is equally natural that di&s;appointment &s;hould produce &s;orrow.</P>
<P>An event fortunate or unfortunate, that falls out by accident without being fore&s;een or thought of, and which therefore could not be the object of de&s;ire, rai&s;eth an emo|tion of the &s;ame kind with that now men|tioned. But the cau&s;e mu&s;t be different; for there can be no gratification where there is no de&s;ire. We have not however far to
<PB N="67" REF="78">
&s;eek for a cau&s;e. A man cannot be indiffer|ent to an event that affects him or any of his connections. If it be fortunate, it gives him joy; if unfortunate, it gives him &s;or|row.</P>
<P>In no &s;ituation doth joy ri&s;e to a greater height, than upon the removal of any vio|lent di&s;tre&s;s of mind or body; and in no &s;i|tuation doth &s;orrow ri&s;e to a greater height, than upon the removal of what makes us happy. The &s;en&s;ibility of our nature &s;erves in part to account for the&s;e effects. Other cau&s;es al&s;o concur. We can be under no violent di&s;tre&s;s without an anxious de&s;ire to be free from it; and therefore its removal is a high gratification. We cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any thing that makes us happy, without wi&s;hing its continuance; and therefore its removal by cro&s;&s;ing our wi&s;hes mu&s;t create &s;orrow. Nor is this all. The principle of contra&s;t comes in for its &s;hare. An emotion of joy ari&s;ing upon the removal of pain, is increa&s;ed by contra&s;t when we reflect upon our former di&s;tre&s;s. En emotion of &s;orrow upon being deprived of any good, is increa|&s;ed

<P>It hath always been reckoned difficult to account for the extreme plea&s;ure that fol|lows a ce&s;&s;ation of bodily pain; as when one is relieved from the rack, or from a vio|lent fit of the &s;tone. What is &s;aid, explains this difficulty in the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;imple&s;t manner. Ce&s;&s;ation of bodily pain is not of it&s;elf a plea&s;ure; for a <HI>non-ens</HI> or a negative can neither give plea&s;ure nor pain. But man is &s;o framed by nature as to rejoice when he is ea&s;ed of pain, as well as to be &s;orrow|ful when deprived of any good. This branch of our con&s;titution, is chiefly the
<PB N="69" REF="80">
cau&s;e of the plea&s;ure. The gratification of de&s;ire comes in as an acce&s;&s;ory cau&s;e; and contra&s;t joins its force, by increa&s;ing the &s;en&s;e of our pre&s;ent happine&s;s. In the ca&s;e of an acute pain, a peculiar circum&s;tance contributes its part. The bri&s;k circulation of the animal &s;pirits occa&s;ioned by acute pain, continues after the pain is vani&s;hed, and produceth a very plea&s;ant feeling. Sick|ne&s;s hath not that effect, becau&s;e it is al|ways attended with a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that the gradual dimi|nution of acute pain, occa&s;ions a mixt emotion, partly plea&s;ant, partly painful. The partial diminution produceth joy in proportion; but the remaining pain balan|ceth our joy. This mixt feeling, how|ever, hath no long endurance. For the joy that ari&s;eth upon the diminution of pain, &s;oon vani&s;heth; and leaveth in the undi&s;|turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that degree of pain which remains.</P>
<P>What is above ob&s;erved about bodily pain, is equally applicable to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the mind; and accordingly it is a common ar|tifice, to prepare us for the reception of good news by alarming our fears.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Sympathetic emotion of virtue, and its cau&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>ONE feeling there is, that merits a delibe|rate view, for its &s;ingularity, as well as utility. Whether to call it an emotion or a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eems uncertain. The former it can &s;carce be, becau&s;e it involves de&s;ire; and the latter it can &s;carce be, becau&s;e it has no object. But this feeling and its nature will be be&s;t under&s;tood from examples. A &s;ig|nal act of gratitude, produceth in the &s;pecta|tor love or e&s;teem for the author. The &s;pectator hath at the &s;ame time a &s;eparate feeling; which, being mixed with love or e&s;teem, the capital emotion, hath not been much adverted to. It is a vague feeling of gratitude, which hath no object; but which, however, di&s;po&s;es the &s;pectator to acts of gratitude, more than upon ordinary occa&s;ions. Let any man attentively con&s;i|der his own heart when he thinks warmly of any &s;ignal act of gratitude, and he will be con&s;cious of this feeling, as di&s;tinct from
<PB N="71" REF="82">
the e&s;teem or admiration he has for the grateful per&s;on. It merits our utmo&s;t atten|tion, by unfolding a curious piece of me|chani&s;m in the nature of man. The feeling is &s;ingular in the following re&s;pect, that it involves a de&s;ire to perform acts of gratitude, without having any particular object; though in this &s;tate the mind, wonderfully di&s;po&s;ed toward an object, neglects no ob|ject upon which it can vent it&s;elf. Any act of kindne&s;s or good-will that would not be regarded upon another occa&s;ion, is greedily &s;eized; and the vague feeling is converted into a real pa&s;&s;ion of gratitude. In &s;uch a &s;tate, favours are returned double.</P>
<P>Again, a courageous action produceth in a &s;pectator the pa&s;&s;ion of admiration direct|ed upon the author. But be&s;ide this well|known pa&s;&s;ion, a &s;eparate feeling is rai&s;ed in the &s;pectator; which may be called <HI>an emotion of courage,</HI> becau&s;e while under its influence he is con&s;cious of a boldne&s;s and intrepidity beyond ordinary, and longs for proper objects upon which to exert this emotion.</P>

<P>For another example, let us figure &s;ome grand and heroic action, highly agreeable to the &s;pectator. Be&s;ide a &s;ingular venera|tion for the author, the &s;pectator feels in him&s;elf an unu&s;ual dignity of character, which di&s;po&s;eth him to great and noble ac|tions. And herein principally con&s;i&s;ts the extreme delight every one hath in the hi|&s;tories of conquerors and heroes.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular feeling, which may be termed <HI>the &s;ympathetic emotion of virtue,</HI> re|&s;embles,
<PB N="73" REF="84">
in one re&s;pect, the well-known ap|petites that lead to the propagation and pre|&s;ervation of the &s;pecies. The appetites of hunger, thir&s;t, and animal love, ari&s;e in the mind without being directed upon any par|ticular object; and in no ca&s;e whatever is the mind more &s;olicitous for a proper object, than when under the influence of any of the&s;e appetites.</P>
<P>The feeling I have endeavoured to e|volve, may well be termed <HI>the &s;ympathe|tic emotion of virtue</HI>; for it is rai&s;ed in a &s;pectator by virtuous actions of every kind, and by no other &s;ort. When we contem|plate a virtuous action, which never fails to delight us and to prompt our love for the author, the mind is warmed and put into a tone &s;imilar to what in&s;pired the virtuous ac|tion. The propen&s;ity we have to &s;uch ac|tions is &s;o much enlivened, as to become for a time an actual emotion. But no man hath a propen&s;ity to vice as &s;uch. On the contrary, a wicked deed di&s;gu&s;ts him, and makes him abhor the author. This abhorrence is a &s;trong antidote &s;o long as

any impre&s;&s;ion remains of the wicked ac|tion.</P>
<P>In a rough road, a halt to view a fine country is refre&s;hing; and here a delightful pro&s;pect opens upon us.

Ju&s;tice is per|ceived to be our duty, and it is guarded by natural puni&s;hments, from which the guilty never e&s;cape.

And to leave virtue in no quarter un&s;upported, here is unfolded an admirable contrivance, by which good ex|ample commands the heart and adds to virtue the force of habit. Did our moral feelings extend no farther than to approve the action and to be&s;tow our affection on the author, good example would not have great influence. But to give it the utmo&s;t force, nothing can be better contrived than the &s;ympathetic emotion under con&s;idera|tion,

which prompts us to imitate what we admire. This &s;ingular emotion will readily find an object to exert it&s;elf upon; and at any rate, it never exi&s;ts without producing &s;ome effect. Virtuous emotions of this &s;ort, are in &s;ome degree an exerci&s;e of virtue. They are a mental exerci&s;e at lea&s;t, if they &s;how not externally. And every exerci&s;e of virtue, internal and external, leads to habit; for a di&s;po&s;ition or propen&s;ity of the mind, like a limb of the body, becomes &s;tronger by exerci&s;e. Proper means, at the &s;ame time, being ever at hand to rai&s;e this &s;ympathetic emotion, its frequent reiteration may, in a good mea&s;ure, &s;upply the want of a more complete exerci&s;e. Thus, by proper di&s;cipline, every per&s;on may acquire a &s;et|tled habit of virtue. Intercour&s;e with men of worth, hi&s;tories of generous and di&s;in|tere&s;ted actions, and frequent meditation upon them, keep the &s;ympathetic emotion in con&s;tant exerci&s;e, which by degrees intro|duceth a habit, and confirms the authority of virtue. With re&s;pect to education in particular, what a &s;pacious and commo|dious avenue to the heart of a young per|&s;on, is here opened?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. In many in&s;tances one emotion is productive of another. The &s;ame of pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t chapter it is ob&s;erved, that the relations by which things are mutually connected, have a remarkable influence in regulating the train of our ideas. I here add, that they have an influence not le&s;s remarkable, in generating emotions and pa&s;&s;ions. Beginning with the former, it holds in fact, that an agreeable object makes every thing connected with it appear agree|able. The mind gliding &s;weetly and ea&s;ily through related objects, carries along the beauty of objects that made a figure, and blends that beauty with the idea of the pre|&s;ent object, which thereby appears more agreeable than when con&s;idered apart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such pronene&s;s has the mind to this communication of properties, that we often find properties a&s;cribed to a related object, of which naturally it is not &s;u&s;ceptible. Sir Richard Greenville in a &s;ingle &s;hip being &s;urpri&s;ed by the Spani&s;h fleet, was advi&s;ed to retire. He utterly refu&s;ed to turn from the e|nemy; declaring, <Q REND="inline">"he would rather die, than di&s;honour him|&s;elf, his country, and her Maje&s;ty's &s;hip." <BIBL>Hakluyt, vol. 2. part 2. p. 169.</BIBL></Q>  To aid the communication of properties in &s;uch in&s;tances, there always mu&s;t be a momentary per&s;onifi|cation. A &s;hip mu&s;t be imagined a &s;en&s;ible being, to make it &s;u&s;ceptible of honour or di&s;honour. In the battle of Mantinea, Epaminondas being mortally wounded, was carried to his tent in a manner dead. Recovering his &s;en&s;es, the fir&s;t thing he inquired about was his &s;hield; which being brought, he ki&s;&s;ed it as the companion of his valour and glory. It mu&s;t be remarked, that among the Greeks and Romans it was deemed infamous for a &s;oldier to return from battle without his &s;hield.</P></NOTE>.
<PB N="77" REF="88">
This rea&s;on may appear ob&s;cure and meta|phy&s;ical, but it mu&s;t be reli&s;hed when we attend to the following examples, which e&s;tabli&s;h the fact beyond all di&s;pute. No relation is more intimate than that betwixt a being and its qualities; and accordingly, the affection I bear a man expands it&s;elf readily upon all his qualities, which by that means make a greater figure in my mind than more &s;ub&s;tantial qualities in others. The talent of &s;peaking in a friend, is more regarded than that of acting in a per&s;on with whom I have no connection; and graceful motion in a mi&s;tre&s;s, gives more delight than con&s;ummate prudence in any other woman. Affection &s;ometimes ri&s;es &s;o high,
<PB N="78" REF="89">
as to convert defects into properties. The wry neck of Alexander was imitated by his courtiers as a real beauty, without inten|tion to flatter. Thus Lady Piercy, &s;peak|ing of her hu&s;band Hot&s;pur,
<Q><L>&mdash;By his light</L>
<L>Did all the chivalry of England move,</L>
<L>To do brave acts. He was indeed the gla&s;s,</L>
<L>Wherein the noble youth did dre&s;s them&s;elves.</L>
<L>He had no legs that practis'd not his gait:</L>
<L>And &s;peaking thick, which Nature made his ble|mi&s;h,</L>
<L>Became the accents of the valiant:</L>
<L>For tho&s;e who could &s;peak low and tardily,</L>
<L>Would turn their own perfection to abu&s;e,</L>

<P>When the pa&s;&s;ion of love has ended its cour&s;e, its object becomes quite a different creature.&mdash;Nothing left of that genteel motion, that gaiety, that &s;prightly conver&s;a|tion, tho&s;e numberle&s;s graces, that former|ly, in the lover's opinion, charmed all hearts.</P>
<P>The &s;ame communication of pa&s;&s;ion ob|tains
<PB N="79" REF="90">
in the relation of principal and acce&s;&s;o|ry. Pride, of which &s;elf is the object, ex|pands it&s;elf upon a hou&s;e, a garden, &s;er|vants, equipage, and every thing of that nature. A lover addre&s;&s;eth his mi&s;tre&s;s's glove in the following terms:
<Q>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine.</Q>
A temple is in a proper &s;en&s;e an acce&s;&s;ory of the deity to which it is dedicated. Diana is cha&s;te, and not only her temple, but the very i&s;icle which hangs on it, mu&s;t partake of that property:
<Q><L>The noble &s;i&s;ter of Poplicola,</L>
<L>The moon of Rome; cha&s;te as the i&s;icle</L>
<L>That's curdled by the fro&s;t from pure&s;t &s;now,</L>
<L>And hangs on Dian's temple.</L>
<BIBL>Coriolanus, act 5. &s;c. 3.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Thus it is, that the re&s;pect and e&s;teem, which the great, the powerful, the opulent naturally command, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure communicated to their dre&s;s, to their man|ners, and to all their connections. It is this
<PB N="80" REF="91">
principle, which in matters left to our own choice prevails over the natural ta&s;te of beauty and propriety, and gives currency to what is called <HI>the fa&s;hion.</HI></P>
<P>By means of the &s;ame ea&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;i|tion, the bad qualities of an object are car|ried along, and grafted upon related objects. Every good quality in a per&s;on is extingui&s;h|ed by hatred; and every bad quality is &s;pread upon all his connections. A relation more &s;light and tran&s;itory than that of ha|tred, may have the &s;ame effect. Thus the bearer of bad tidings becomes an object of aver&s;ion:
<Q><L>Fellow begone, I cannot brook thy &s;ight,</L>
<L>This news hath made thee a mo&s;t ugly man.</L>
<BIBL>King John, act 3. &s;c. 1.</BIBL></Q><Q><L>Yet the fir&s;t bringer of unwelcome news</L>

<L>Sounds ever after, as a &s;ullen bell</L>
<L>Remember'd, tolling a departing friend.</L>
<BIBL>Second part, Henry IV. act 1. &s;c. 3.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition of the mind to commu|nicate the properties of one object to ano|ther,
<PB N="81" REF="92">
is not always proportioned to the inti|macy of their connection. The order of the tran&s;ition from object to object, hath al|&s;o an influence. The &s;en&s;e of order ope|rates not le&s;s powerfully in this ca&s;e, than in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>. If a thing be agreeable in it&s;elf, all its acce&s;&s;ories appear agreeable. But the agreeablene&s;s of an ac|ce&s;&s;ory, extends not it&s;elf &s;o readily to the principal. Any dre&s;s upon a fine woman is becoming; but the mo&s;t elegant orna|ments upon one that is homely, have &s;carce any effect to mend her appearance. The rea&s;on will be obvious, from what is &s;aid in the chapter above cited. The mind pa&s;&s;|es more ea&s;ily from the principal to its ac|ce&s;&s;ories, than in the oppo&s;ite direction.</P>
<P>The emotions produced as above may properly be termed <HI>&s;econdary,</HI> being occa|&s;ioned either by antecedent emotions or an|tecedent pa&s;&s;ions, which in this re&s;pect may be termed <HI>primary.</HI> And to complete the pre&s;ent theory, I mu&s;t now remark a difference betwixt a primary emotion and a
<PB N="82" REF="93">
primary pa&s;&s;ion in the production of &s;econ|dary emotions. A &s;econdary emotion can|not but be more faint than the primary; and therefore, if the chief or principal ob|ject have not the power to rai&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion, the acce&s;&s;ory object will have &s;till le&s;s power. But if a pa&s;&s;ion be rai&s;ed by the principal object, the &s;econdary emotion may readily &s;well into a pa&s;&s;ion for the acce&s;&s;ory, provi|ded the acce&s;&s;ory be a proper object for de|&s;ire. And thus it happens that one pa&s;&s;ion is often productive of another. Examples are without number: the &s;ole difficulty is a proper choice. I begin with &s;elf-love, and the power it hath to generate other pa&s;&s;ions. The love which parents bear their children, is an illu&s;trious example of the foregoing doctrine. Every man, be&s;ide making part of a greater &s;y&s;tem, like a comet, a planet, or &s;atellite only; hath a le&s;s &s;y&s;tem of his own, in the centre of which he repre&s;ents the &s;un di&s;per&s;ing his fire and heat all a|round. The connection between a man and his children, fundamentally that of cau&s;e and effect, becomes, by the addition of other circum&s;tances, the complete&s;t that can
<PB N="83" REF="94">
be among individuals; and therefore, &s;elf-love, the mo&s;t vigorous of all pa&s;&s;ions, is readily expanded upon children. The &s;e|condary emotion they at fir&s;t produce by means of their connection, is, generally &s;peaking, &s;ufficiently &s;trong to move de&s;ire even from the beginning; and the new pa&s;|&s;ion &s;wells by degrees, till it rival in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;elf-love, the primary pa&s;&s;ion. The following ca&s;e will demon&s;trate the truth of this theory. Remor&s;e for betraying a friend, or murdering an enemy in cold blood, makes a man even hate him&s;elf. In this &s;tate, it is a matter of experience, that he is &s;carce con&s;cious of any affection to his children, but rather of di&s;gu&s;t or ill-will. What cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned for this change, other than the hatred which beginning at him&s;elf, is expanded upon his children? And if &s;o, may we not with equal rea&s;on derive from &s;elf-love the affection a man for ordinary has to them?</P>
<P>The affection a man bears to his blood|relations, depends on the &s;ame principle. Self-love is al&s;o expanded upon them; and the communicated pa&s;&s;ion, is more or le&s;s
<PB N="84" REF="95">
vigorous in proportion to the connection. Nor doth &s;elf-love re&s;t here: it is, by the force of connection, communicated even to things inanimate. And hence the affection a man bears to his property, and to every thing he calls his own.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip, le&s;s vigorous than &s;elf-love, is, for that rea&s;on, le&s;s apt to communicate it&s;elf to children or other relations. In&s;tan|ces however are not wanting, of &s;uch com|municated pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from friend&s;hip when it is &s;trong. Friend&s;hip may go higher in the matrimonial &s;tate than in any other condition: and Otway, in <HI>Venice pre&s;erv'd,</HI> &s;hows a fine ta&s;te in taking ad|vantage of that circum&s;tance. In the &s;cene where Belvidera &s;ues to her father for par|don, &s;he is repre&s;ented as pleading her mo|ther's merit, and the re&s;emblance &s;he bore to her mother.

This explains why any meritorious action or any illu&s;trious qualification in my &s;on or my friend, is apt to make me overvalue my|&s;elf. If I value my friend's wife or his &s;on upon account of their connection with him, it is &s;till more natural that I &s;hould value my&s;elf upon account of my own connection with him.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip, or any other &s;ocial affection, may produce oppo&s;ite effects. Pity, by inter|e&s;ting us &s;trongly for the per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t of con&s;equence inflame our re&s;entment again&s;t the author of the di&s;tre&s;s. For, in general, the affection we have for any man,
<PB N="86" REF="97">
generates in us good-will to his friends and ill-will to his enemies. Shake&s;pear &s;hows great art in the funeral oration pronounced by Antony over the body of Cae&s;ar. He fir&s;t endeavours to excite grief in the hearers, by dwelling upon the deplorable lo&s;s of &s;o great a man. This pa&s;&s;ion rai&s;ed to a pitch, in|tere&s;ting them &s;trongly in Cae&s;ar's fate, could not fail to produce a lively &s;en&s;e of the trea|chery and cruelty of the con&s;pirators; an infallible method to inflame the re&s;entment of the multitude beyond all bounds.

Had Antony directed upon the con&s;pira|tors the thoughts of his audience, without paving the way by rai&s;ing their grief, his &s;peech perhaps might have failed of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Hatred and other di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, pro|duce effects directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e above mentioned. If I hate a man, his children, his relations, nay his property, become to
<PB N="88" REF="99">
me objects of aver&s;ion. His enemies, on the other hand, I am di&s;po&s;ed to e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The more &s;light and tran&s;itory connec|tions, have generally no power to pro|duce a communicated pa&s;&s;ion. Anger, when &s;udden and violent, is one exception; for if the per&s;on who did the injury be re|moved out of reach, this pa&s;&s;ion will vent it&s;elf upon any related object, how|ever &s;light the relation be. Another ex|ception makes a greater figure. A group of beings or things, becomes often the object of a communicated pa&s;&s;ion, even where the relation of the individuals to the principal object is but faint. Thus though I put no value upon a &s;ingle man for living in the &s;ame town with my&s;elf; my town&s;men however, con&s;idered in a body, are preferred before others. This is &s;till more remarkable with re&s;pect to my countrymen in general. The grandeur of the complex object, &s;wells the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-love by the relation I have to my native country; and every pa&s;|&s;ion, when it &s;wells beyond its ordinary bounds, hath, in that circum&s;tance, a pe|culiar tendency to expand it&s;elf along rela|ted
<PB N="89" REF="100">
objects. In fact, in&s;tances are not rare, of per&s;ons, who, upon all occa&s;ions, are willing to &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes for their country. Such influence upon the mind of man, hath a complex object, or, more properly &s;peaking, a general term<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on morality and natural religion, part 1. e&s;&s;. 2. ch. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of order hath, in the commu|nication of pa&s;&s;ion, an influence not le&s;s re|markable than in the communication of e|motions. It is a common ob&s;ervation, that a man's affection to his parents is le&s;s vigorous than to his children. The order of nature in de&s;cending to children, aids the tran&s;|ition of the affection. The a&s;cent to a pa|rent, contrary to this order, makes the tran&s;|ition more difficult. Gratitude to a bene|factor is readily extended to his children; but not &s;o readily to his parents. The difference however betwixt the natural and inverted order, is not &s;o con&s;ider|able, but that it may be balanced by other circum&s;tances. Pliny<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. cap. 36.</NOTE> gives an ac|count of a woman of rank condemned
<PB N="90" REF="101">
to die for a crime; and, to avoid public &s;hame, detained in pri&s;on to die of hunger. Her life being prolonged beyond expecta|tion, it was di&s;covered, that &s;he was nou|ri&s;hed by &s;ucking milk from the brea&s;ts of her daughter. This in&s;tance of filial piety, which aided the tran&s;ition and made a|&s;cent not le&s;s ea&s;y than de&s;cent is for ordi|nary, procured a pardon to the mother, and a pen&s;ion to both. The &s;tory of An|drocles and the lion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aulus Gelliu, lib. 5. cap. 14.</NOTE> may be accounted for in the &s;ame manner. The admiration, of which the lion was the cau&s;e, for his kindne&s;s and gratitude to Androcles, produced good|will to Androcles, and pardon of his crime.</P>
<P>And this leads to other ob&s;ervations upon communicated pa&s;&s;ions. I love my daugh|ter le&s;s after &s;he is married, and my mother le&s;s after a &s;econd marriage. The marriage of my &s;on or my father dimini&s;hes not my af|fection &s;o remarkably. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds with re&s;pect to friend&s;hip, gratitude, and other pa&s;&s;ions. The love I bear my friend, is but faintly extended to his mar|ried daughter. The re&s;entment I have
<PB N="91" REF="102">
again&s;t a man, is readily extended again&s;t children who make part of his family: not &s;o readily again&s;t children who are forisfa|miliated, e&s;pecially by marriage. This difference is al&s;o more remarkable in daugh|ters than in &s;ons. The&s;e are curious facts; and to evolve the cau&s;e we mu&s;t examine minutely, that operation of the mind by which a pa&s;&s;ion is extended to a related ob|ject. In con&s;idering two things as related, the mind is not &s;tationary, but pa&s;&s;eth and repa&s;&s;eth from the one to the other, viewing the relation from each of them perhaps oftener than once. This holds more e&s;pe|cially in con&s;idering a relation betwixt things of unequal rank, as betwixt the cau&s;e and the effect, or betwixt a principal and an acce&s;&s;ory. In contemplating the relation betwixt a building and its orna|ments, the mind is not &s;atisfied with a &s;ingle tran&s;ition from the former to the latter. It mu&s;t al&s;o view the relation, be|ginning at the latter, and pa&s;&s;ing from it to the former. This vibration of the mind in pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing betwixt things that are related, explains the facts above mentioned.
<PB N="92" REF="103">
The mind pa&s;&s;eth ea&s;ily from the father to the daughter; but where the daughter is married, this new relation attracts the mind, and ob&s;tructs, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the return from the daughter to the father. Any ob&s;truction the mind meets with in pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing betwixt its objects, occa&s;ions a like ob&s;truction in the commu|nication of pa&s;&s;ion. The marriage of a male ob&s;tructs le&s;s the ea&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;ition; be|cau&s;e a male is le&s;s &s;unk by the relation of marriage than a female.</P>
<P>The foregoing in&s;tances, are of pa&s;&s;ion communicated from one object to another. But one pa&s;&s;ion may be generated by an|other, without change of object. It may in general be ob&s;erved, that a pa&s;&s;ion paves the way to others, &s;imilar in their tone, whether directed upon the &s;ame or upon a different object. For the mind heated by any pa&s;&s;ion, is, in that &s;tate, more &s;u&s;cep|tible of a new impre&s;&s;ion in a &s;imilar tone, than when cool and quie&s;cent. It is a com|mon ob&s;ervation, that pity generally pro|duceth friend&s;hip for a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="93" REF="104">
Pity intere&s;ts us in its object, and recom|mends all its virtuous qualities. For this rea&s;on, female beauty &s;hows be&s;t in di&s;tre&s;s; and is more apt to in&s;pire love, than upon ordinary occa&s;ions. But it is chiefly to be remarked, that pity, warming and melting the &s;pectator, prepares him for the recep|tion of other tender affections; and pity is readily improved into love or friend&s;hip, by a certain tenderne&s;s and concern for the ob|ject, which is the tone of both pa&s;&s;ions. The aptitude of pity to produce love is beautifully illu&s;trated by Shake&s;pear.

<HEAD>SECT. V. Cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and anger.</HEAD>
<P>FEar and anger, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of nature, are happily &s;o contrived as to operate either in&s;tinctively or deliberately. So far as they prompt actions con&s;idered as means leading to a certain end, they fall in with the general &s;y&s;tem, and require no particular explanation. If any object have a threatening appearance, rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts means to avoid the danger. If I am inju|red, the fir&s;t thing I think of, is in what manner I &s;hall be revenged, and what means I &s;hall employ. The&s;e particulars are not le&s;s obvious than natural. But as the pa&s;&s;ions of fear and anger, &s;o far as in|&s;tinctive, are le&s;s familiar to us, and their nature generally not under&s;tood; I thought it would not be unacceptable to the reader
<PB N="96" REF="107">
to have them accurately delineated. He may al&s;o po&s;&s;ibly reli&s;h the opportunity of this &s;pecimen, to have the nature of in|&s;tinctive pa&s;&s;ions more fully explained than there was formerly occa&s;ion to do. I begin with fear.</P>
<P>Self-pre&s;ervation is to individuals a mat|ter of too great importance to be left en|tirely under the guardian&s;hip of &s;elf-love, which cannot be put in exerci&s;e otherwi&s;e than by the intervention of rea&s;on and re|flection. Nature hath acted here with her u&s;ual precaution and fore&s;ight. Fear and anger are pa&s;&s;ions common to all men; and by operating in&s;tinctively, they fre|quently afford &s;ecurity when the &s;lower o|perations of deliberative rea&s;on would be too late. We take nouri&s;hment commonly, not by the direction of rea&s;on, but by the incitement of hunger and thir&s;t. In the &s;ame manner, we avoid danger by the in|citement of fear, which often, before there is time for reflection, placeth us in &s;afety. This matter then is ordered with con&s;um|mate wi&s;dom. It is not within the reach of fancy, to conceive any thing better fitted
<PB N="97" REF="108">
to an&s;wer its purpo&s;e, than this in&s;tinctive pa&s;&s;ion of fear, which, upon the fir&s;t &s;ur|mi&s;e of danger, operates in&s;tantaneou&s;ly without reflection. So little doth the pa&s;|&s;ion, in &s;uch in&s;tances, depend on rea&s;on, that we often find it exerted even in con|tradiction to rea&s;on, and when we are con|&s;cious that there is no hazard. A man who is not much upon his guard, cannot avoid &s;hrinking at a blow, though he knows it to be aimed in &s;port; nor clo&s;ing his eyes at the approach of what may hurt them, though he is confident it will not come their length. Influenced by the &s;ame in&s;tinctive pa&s;&s;ion of fear, infants are much affected with a &s;tern look, a menacing tone, or other expre&s;&s;ion of anger; though, being incapable of reflection, they cannot form the &s;lighte&s;t judge|ment about the import of the&s;e &s;igns. This is all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid in general. The natural connection betwixt fear and the external &s;igns of anger, will be handled in the chapter of the external &s;igns of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fear provides for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation by fly|ing
<PB N="98" REF="109">
from harm; anger, by repelling it. No|thing indeed can be better contrived to repel or prevent injury, than anger or re&s;entment. De&s;titute of this pa&s;&s;ion, men, like defence|le&s;s lambs, would lie con&s;tantly open to mi&s;chief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Bra&s;idas being &s;urpri&s;ed by the bite of a mou&s;e he had catched, let it &s;lip out of his &s;ingers. <Q REND="inline">"No creature (&s;ays he) is &s;o contemptible, but what may provide for its own &s;afety, if it have courage to defend it&s;elf." <BIBL>Plutarch. Apothegmata.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>. Deliberate anger cau&s;ed by a voluntary injury, is too well known to require any explanation. If my de&s;ire be in general to re&s;ent an afront, I mu&s;t u&s;e means, and the&s;e means mu&s;t be di&s;covered by reflection. Deliberation is here requi|&s;ite; and in this, which is the ordinary ca&s;e, the pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom exceeds ju&s;t bounds. But where anger &s;uddenly inflames me to return a blow, the pa&s;&s;ion is in&s;tinctive, and the action ultimate; and it is chiefly in &s;uch ca&s;es that the pa&s;&s;ion is ra&s;h and un|governable, becau&s;e it operates blindly, without affording time for rea&s;on or delibe|ration.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="110">
In&s;tinctive anger is frequently rai&s;ed by bodily pain, which, when &s;udden and ex|ce&s;&s;ive as by a &s;troke on a tender part, ruf|fling the temper and unhinging the mind, is in its tone &s;imilar to anger. Bodily pain by this means di&s;po&s;es to anger, which is as &s;uddenly rai&s;ed, provided an object be found to vent it upon. Anger commonly is not pro|voked otherwi&s;e than by a voluntary injury. But when a man is thus beforehand di&s;po|&s;ed to anger, he is not nice nor &s;crupulous about an object. The man who gave the &s;troke, however accidentally, is by an in|flammable temper held a proper object, mere|ly becau&s;e he was the occa&s;ion of the pain. It is &s;till a &s;tronger example of the kind, that a &s;tock or a &s;tone, by which I am hurt, becomes an object for my re&s;entment. I am violently incited to bray it to atoms. The pa&s;&s;ion indeed in this ca&s;e is but mo|mentary. It vani&s;heth with the fir&s;t reflec|tion, being attended with no circum&s;tance that can excu&s;e it in any degree. Nor is this irrational effect confined to bodily pain. Inward di&s;tre&s;s, when exce&s;&s;ive, may be the occa&s;ion of effects equally irrational.

<P>I have cho&s;en to exhibit anger in its more rare appearances, for in the&s;e we can be&s;t trace its nature and extent. In the examples above given, it appears to be an ab&s;urd pa&s;|&s;ion and altogether irrational. But we ought to con&s;ider, that it is not the intention of nature to &s;ubject this pa&s;&s;ion, in every in|&s;tance, to rea&s;on and reflection. It was gi|ven us to prevent or to repel injuries; and, like fear, it often operates blindly and in|&s;tinctively, without the lea&s;t view to con&s;e|quences. The very fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation of harm, &s;ets it in motion to repel injury by puni&s;h|ment. Were it more cool and deliberate, it would lo&s;e its threatening appearance, and be in&s;ufficient to guard us again&s;t violence and mi&s;chief. When &s;uch is and ought to be the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion, it is not won|derful to find it exerted irregularly and ca|priciou&s;ly, as it &s;ometimes is where the mi&s;|chief
<PB N="104" REF="115">
is &s;udden and unfore&s;een. All the harm that can be done by the pa&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e, is in&s;tantaneous; for the &s;horte&s;t de|lay &s;ets all to rights; and circum&s;tances are &s;eldom &s;o unlucky as to put it in the power of a pa&s;&s;ionate man to do much harm in an in&s;tant.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Emotions cau&s;ed by fiction.</HEAD>
<P>THE attentive reader will ob&s;erve, that in accounting for pa&s;&s;ions and emo|tions, no cau&s;e hitherto has been a&s;&s;igned but what hath a real exi&s;tence. Whether it be a being, action, or quality, that moveth us, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an object of our knowledge, or at lea&s;t of our belief. This ob&s;ervation di&s;covers to us that the &s;ubject is not yet exhau&s;ted; becau&s;e our pa&s;&s;ions, as all the world know, are moved by fic|tion as well as by truth. In judging before|hand of man, &s;o remarkably addicted to truth and reality, one &s;hould little dream
<PB N="105" REF="116">
that fiction could have any effect upon him. But man's intellectual faculties are too im|perfect to dive far even into his own nature. I &s;hall take occa&s;ion afterward to &s;how, that this branch of the human con&s;titution, is contrived with admirable wi&s;dom and is &s;ub&s;ervient to excellent purpo&s;es. In the mean time, I mu&s;t endeavour to unfold, by what means fiction hath &s;uch influence on the mind.</P>
<P>That the objects of our &s;en&s;es really ex|i&s;t in the way and manner we perceive, is a branch of intuitive knowledge. When I &s;ee a man walking, a tree growing, or cat|tle grazing, I have a conviction that the&s;e things are preci&s;ely as they appear. If I be a &s;pectator of any tran&s;action or event, I have a conviction of the real exi&s;tence of the per&s;ons engaged, of their words, and of their actions. Nature determines us to rely on the veracity of our &s;en&s;es. And indeed, if our &s;en&s;es did not convince us of the reality of their objects, they could not in any de|gree an&s;wer their end.</P>
<P>By the power of memory, a thing for|merly &s;een may be recalled to the mind
<PB N="106" REF="117">
with different degrees of accuracy. We commonly are &s;atisfied with a &s;light recol|lection of the chief circum&s;tances; and, in &s;uch recollection, the thing is not figured as pre&s;ent nor any image formed. I retain the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and barely remember that formerly I was a &s;pectator. But with re&s;pect to an intere&s;ting object or event which made a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion, the mind &s;ometimes, not &s;atisfied with a cur&s;ory review, chu&s;es to revolve every circum&s;tance. In this ca&s;e, I conceive my|&s;elf to be a &s;pectator as I was originally; and I perceive every particular pa&s;&s;ing in my pre&s;ence, in the &s;ame manner as when I was in reality a &s;pectator. For example, I &s;aw ye&s;terday a beautiful woman in tears for the lo&s;s of an only child, and was greatly mo|ved with her di&s;tre&s;s. Not &s;atisfied with a &s;light recollection or bare remembrance, I in&s;i&s;t on the melancholy &s;cene. Conceiving my&s;elf to be in the place where I was an eye-witne&s;s, every circum&s;tance appears to me as at fir&s;t. I think I &s;ee the woman in tears and hear her moans. Hence it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that in a complete idea of me|mory
<PB N="107" REF="118">
there is no pa&s;t nor future. A thing recalled to the mind with the accuracy I have been de&s;cribing, is perceived as in our view, and con&s;equently as pre&s;ently exi&s;t|ing. Pa&s;t time makes a part of an incom|plete idea only: I remember or reflect, that &s;ome years ago I was at Oxford, and &s;aw the fir&s;t &s;tone laid of the Ratcliff library; and I remember that at a &s;till greater di|&s;tance of time, I heard a debate in the hou&s;e of Commons about a &s;tanding army.</P>
<P>Lamentable is the imperfection of lan|guage, almo&s;t in every particular that falls not under external &s;en&s;e. I am talking of a matter exceeding clear in it&s;elf, and of which every per&s;on mu&s;t be con&s;cious; and yet I find no &s;mall difficulty to expre&s;s it clearly in words; for it is not accurate to talk of incidents long pa&s;t as pa&s;&s;ing in our &s;ight, nor of hearing at pre&s;ent what we really heard ye&s;terday or perhaps a year ago. To this nece&s;&s;ity I am reduced, by want of pro|per words to de&s;cribe ideal pre&s;ence and to di&s;tingui&s;h it from real pre&s;ence. And thus in the de&s;cription, a plain &s;ubject becomes ob&s;cure and intricate. When I recall any
<PB N="108" REF="119">
thing in the di&s;tincte&s;t manner, &s;o as to form an idea or image of it as pre&s;ent; I have not words to de&s;cribe this act, other than that I perceive the thing as a &s;pectator, and as ex|i&s;ting in my pre&s;ence. This means not that I am really a &s;pectator; but only that I con|ceive my&s;elf to be a &s;pectator, and have a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ence &s;imilar to what a real &s;pectator hath.</P>
<P>As many rules of critici&s;m depend on ideal pre&s;ence, the reader, it is expected, will take &s;ome pains to form an exact notion of it, as di&s;tingui&s;hed on the one hand from real pre&s;ence, and on the other from a &s;u|perficial or reflective remembrance. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the former by the follow|ing circum&s;tance. Ideal pre&s;ence ari&s;ing from an act of memory, may properly be termed <HI>a waking dream</HI>; becau&s;e, like a dream, it vani&s;heth upon the fir&s;t reflection of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Real pre&s;ence, on the contrary, vouched by eye-&s;ight, com|mands our belief, not only during the di|rect perception, but in reflecting afterward upon the object. And to di&s;tingui&s;h ideal pre&s;ence from the latter, I give the follow|ing
<PB N="109" REF="120">
illu&s;tration. Two internal acts, both of them exertions of memory, are clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable. When I think of an event as pa&s;t, without forming any image, it is barely reflecting or remembering that I was an eye-witne&s;s. But when I recall the event &s;o di&s;tinctly as to form a complete image of it, I perceive it ideally as pa&s;&s;ing in my pre&s;ence; and this ideal perception is an act of intuition, into which reflection en|ters not more than into an act of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Though ideal pre&s;ence be di&s;tingui&s;hed from real pre&s;ence on the one &s;ide and from reflective remembrance on the other, it is however variable without any preci&s;e limits; ri&s;ing &s;ometimes toward the former, and of|ten &s;inking toward the latter. In a vigorous exertion of memory, ideal pre&s;ence is ex|tremely di&s;tinct. When a man, as in a reverie, drops him&s;elf out of his thoughts, he perceives every thing as pa&s;&s;ing before him, and hath a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ence &s;imilar to that of a &s;pectator. There is no other difference, but that in the former the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ence is le&s;s firm and clear than in the latter. But this is &s;eldom
<PB N="110" REF="121">
the ca&s;e. Ideal pre&s;ence is often faint, and the image &s;o ob&s;cure as not to differ widely from reflective remembrance.</P>
<P>Hitherto of an idea of memory. I pro|ceed to con&s;ider the idea of a thing I never &s;aw, rai&s;ed in me by &s;peech, by writing, or by painting. This idea, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent matter, is of the &s;ame nature with an idea of memory, being either complete or incomplete. An important event, by a lively and accurate de&s;cription, rou&s;es my attention and in&s;en&s;ibly transforms me into a &s;pectator: I perceive ideally every inci|dent as pa&s;&s;ing in my pre&s;ence. On the other hand, a &s;light or &s;uperficial narrative produceth only a faint and incomplete idea, preci&s;ely &s;imilar to a reflective recollection of memory. Of &s;uch idea, ideal pre&s;ence makes no part. Pa&s;t time is a circum&s;tance that enters into this idea, as it doth into a reflective idea of memory. I believe that Scipio exi&s;ted about 2000 years ago, and that he overcame Hannibal in the famous battle of Zama. When I revolve in &s;o cur|&s;ory a manner that memorable event, I con&s;ider it as long pa&s;t. But &s;uppo&s;ing me
<PB N="111" REF="122">
to be warmed with the &s;tory, perhaps by a beautiful de&s;cription, I am in&s;en&s;ibly transformed to a &s;pectator. I perceive the&s;e two heroes in act to engage; I perceive them brandi&s;hing their &s;words, and exhort|ing their troops; and in this manner I at|tend them through every circum&s;tance of the battle. This event being pre&s;ent to my mind during the whole progre&s;s of my thoughts, admits not any time but the pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. &s;ect. 1. of the pre&s;ent chapter.</NOTE>, that ideas both of memory and of &s;peech, pro|duce emotions of the &s;ame kind with what are produced by an immediate view of the object; only fainter, in proportion as an idea is fainter than an original perception. The in&s;ight we have now got, unfolds the means by which this effect is produced. Ideal pre&s;ence &s;upplies the want of real pre|&s;ence; and in idea we perceive per&s;ons acting and &s;uffering, preci&s;ely as in an ori|ginal &s;urvey. If our &s;ympathy be engaged by the latter, it mu&s;t al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure
<PB N="112" REF="123">
be engaged by the former. The di&s;tinct|ne&s;s of ideal pre&s;ence, as above mentioned, approacheth &s;ometimes to the di&s;tinctne&s;s of real pre&s;ence; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ence is the &s;ame in both. This is the cau&s;e of the plea&s;ure that is felt in a reverie, where a man, lo&s;ing &s;ight of him&s;elf, is totally occupied with the objects pa&s;&s;ing in his mind, which he conceives to be really ex|i&s;ting in his pre&s;ence. The power of &s;peech to rai&s;e emotions, depends entirely on the artifice of rai&s;ing &s;uch lively and di&s;tinct images as are here de&s;cribed. The reader's pa&s;&s;ions are never &s;en&s;ibly moved, till he be thrown into a kind of reverie; in which &s;tate, lo&s;ing the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf, and of reading, his pre&s;ent occupation, he con|ceives every incident as pa&s;&s;ing in his pre|&s;ence, preci&s;ely as if he were an eye-wit|ne&s;s. A general or reflective remembrance hath not this effect. It may be agreeable in &s;ome &s;light degree; but the ideas &s;ug|ge&s;ted by it, are too faint and ob&s;cure to rai&s;e any thing like a &s;ympathetic emotion. And were they ever &s;o lively, they pa&s;s with too much precipitation to have this

effect. Our emotions are never in&s;tanta|neous: even tho&s;e that come the &s;oone&s;t to perfection, have different periods of birth, growth, and maturity; and to give oppor|tunity for the&s;e different periods, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that the cau&s;e of every emotion be pre|&s;ent to the mind a due time. The emo|tion is completed by reiterated impre&s;&s;ions. We know this to be the ca&s;e of objects of &s;ight: we are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of any emotion in a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion even of the mo&s;t beau|tiful objects.

<P>Though all this while, I have been only de&s;cribing what pa&s;&s;eth in the mind of eve|ry one and what every one mu&s;t be con|&s;cious of, it was nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon it; becau&s;e, however clear in the internal conception, it is far from being &s;o when de|&s;cribed in words. Ideal pre&s;ence, though of general importance, hath &s;carce ever been touched by any writer; and at any rate it could not be overlooked in account|ing for the effects produced by fiction. Upon this point, the reader I gue&s;s has prevented me. It already mu&s;t have occur|red

to him, that if, in reading, ideal pre&s;ence be the means by which our pa&s;&s;ions are moved, it makes no difference whether the &s;ubject be a fable or a reality. When ideal pre&s;ence is complete, we perceive every object as in our &s;ight; and the mind, totally occupied with an intere&s;ting event, finds no lei&s;ure for reflection of any &s;ort. This rea&s;oning, if any one he&s;itate, is confirmed by con&s;tant and univer&s;al experience. Let us take under con&s;ideration the meeting of Hector and Andromache in the &s;ixth book of the Iliad, or &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ionate &s;cenes in King Lear. The&s;e pictures of human life, when we are &s;ufficiently engaged, give an impre&s;&s;ion of reality not le&s;s di&s;tinct than that given by the death of Otho in the beau|tiful de&s;cription of Tacitus. We never once reflect whether the &s;tory be true or feigned. Reflection comes afterward, when we have the &s;cene no longer before our eyes. This rea&s;oning will appear in a &s;till clearer light, by oppo&s;ing ideal pre&s;ence to ideas rai&s;ed by a cur&s;ory narrative; which ideas being faint, ob&s;cure, and imperfect, occupy the mind &s;o little as to &s;olicit reflection. And ac|cordingly,
<PB N="115" REF="126">
a curt narrative of feigned inci|dents is never reli&s;hed. Any &s;light plea&s;ure it affords, is more than counterbalanced by the di&s;gu&s;t it in&s;pires for want of truth.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the foregoing theory, I add what I reckon a deci&s;ive argument. Upon examination it will be found, that genuine hi&s;tory commands our pa&s;&s;ions by means of ideal pre&s;ence &s;olely; and therefore that with re&s;pect to this effect, genuine hi&s;tory &s;tands upon the &s;ame footing with fable. To me it appears clear, that our &s;ympathy mu&s;t vani&s;h &s;o &s;oon as we begin to reflect upon the incidents related in either. The reflec|tion that a &s;tory is a pure fiction, will in|deed prevent our &s;ympathy; but &s;o will equally the reflection that the per&s;ons de|&s;cribed are no longer exi&s;ting. It is pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s only that moves my pity. My con|cern vani&s;hes with the di&s;tre&s;s; for I can|not pity any per&s;on who at pre&s;ent is happy. According to this theory, founded clearly on human nature, a man long dead and in|&s;en&s;ible now of pa&s;t misfortunes, cannot move our pity more than if he had never exi&s;ted. The misfortunes de&s;cribed in a
<PB N="116" REF="127">
genuine hi&s;tory command our belief: but then we believe al&s;o, that the&s;e misfortunes are at an end, and that the per&s;ons de&s;cribed are at pre&s;ent under no di&s;tre&s;s. What ef|fect, for example, can the belief of the rape of Lucretia have to rai&s;e our &s;ympathy, when &s;he died above 2000 years ago, and hath at pre&s;ent no painful feeling of the in|jury done her? The effect of hi&s;tory in point of in&s;truction, depends in &s;ome mea|&s;ure upon its veracity. But hi&s;tory cannot reach the heart, while we indulge any re|flection upon the facts. Such reflection, if it engage our belief, never fails at the &s;ame time to poi&s;on our plea&s;ure, by convincing us that our &s;ympathy for tho&s;e who are dead and gone is ab&s;urd. And if reflection be laid a&s;ide, hi&s;tory &s;tands upon the &s;ame footing with fable. What effect either of them may have to rai&s;e our &s;ympathy, de|pends on the vivacity of the ideas they rai&s;e; and with re&s;pect to that circum&s;tance, fable is generally more &s;ucce&s;sful than hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Of all the means for making an impre&s;&s;ion of ideal pre&s;ence, theatrical repre&s;entation is the mo&s;t powerful. That words inde|pendent
<PB N="117" REF="128">
of action have the &s;ame power in a le&s;s degree, every one of &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t have felt: A good tragedy will extort tears in private, though not &s;o forcibly as upon the &s;tage. This power belongs al&s;o to painting. A good hi&s;torical picture makes a deeper impre&s;&s;ion than can be made by words, though not equal to what is made by theatrical action. And as ideal pre&s;ence depends on a lively impre&s;&s;ion, painting &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s a middle place betwixt reading and acting. In making an impre&s;|&s;ion of ideal pre&s;ence, it is not le&s;s &s;uperior to the former than inferior to the latter.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be thought, that our pa&s;&s;ions can be rai&s;ed by painting to &s;uch a height as can be done by words. Of all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive incidents that concur to pro|duce a great event, a picture has the choice but of one, becau&s;e it is confined to a &s;ingle in&s;tant of time. And though the impre&s;|&s;ion it makes, is the deepe&s;t that can be made in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; yet &s;eldom can a pa&s;|&s;ion be rai&s;ed to any height in an in&s;tant, or by a &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ion. It was ob&s;erved a|bove, that our pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e e&s;pecially of
<PB N="118" REF="129">
the &s;ympathetic kind, require a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of impre&s;&s;ions; and for that rea&s;on, read|ing and &s;till more acting have greatly the advantage, by the opportunity of reiterating impre&s;&s;ions without end.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is by means of ideal pre&s;ence that our pa&s;&s;ions are excited; and till words produce that charm they avail no|thing. Even real events intitled to our be|lief, mu&s;t be conceived pre&s;ent and pa&s;&s;ing in our &s;ight before they can move us. And this theory &s;erves to explain &s;everal pheno|mena otherwi&s;e unaccountable. A misfor|tune happening to a &s;tranger, makes a le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion than happening to a man we know, even where we are no way intere&s;ted in him: our acquaintance with this man, however &s;light, aids the conception of his &s;uffering in our pre&s;ence. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, we are little moved with any di&s;tant event; becau&s;e we have more difficulty to conceive it pre&s;ent, than an event that hap|pened in our neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Every one is &s;en&s;ible, that de&s;cribing a pa&s;t event as pre&s;ent, has a fine effect in language. For what other rea&s;on than that
<PB N="119" REF="130">
it aids the conception of ideal pre&s;ence? Take the following example.

In this pa&s;&s;age we may ob&s;erve how the writer inflamed with the &s;ubject, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;lips from the pa&s;t time to the pre&s;ent; led to this form of narration by conceiving every circum&s;tance as pa&s;&s;ing in his own &s;ight. And this at the &s;ame time has a fine effect upon the reader, by advancing him to be as it were a &s;pectator. But this change from the pa&s;t to the pre&s;ent requires &s;ome preparation; and is not graceful in the &s;ame &s;entence where there is no &s;top in the &s;en&s;e; witne&s;s the following pa&s;&s;age.

<P>It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, upon what &s;lender foundations nature, &s;ometimes, erects her mo&s;t &s;olid and magnificent works. In appearance at lea&s;t, what can be more &s;light than ideal pre&s;ence of objects? And yet upon it entirely is &s;uper&s;tructed, that exten|&s;ive influence which language hath over the heart; an influence, which, more than any other means, &s;trengthens the bond of &s;ociety, and attracts individuals from their private &s;y&s;tem to exert them&s;elves in acts of genero|&s;ity and benevolence. Matters of fact, it is true, and truth in general, may be inculca|ted without taking advantage of ideal pre|&s;ence. But without it, the fine&s;t &s;peaker or
<PB N="122" REF="133">
writer would in vain attempt to move any of our pa&s;&s;ion: our &s;ympathy would be confined to objects that are really pre&s;ent: and language would lo&s;e entirely that &s;ignal power it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth, of making us &s;ympathize with beings removed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance of time as well as of place. Nor is the in|fluence of language, by means of this ideal pre&s;ence, confined to the heart. It reaches al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure the under&s;tanding, and contributes to belief. When events are related in a lively manner and every circum&s;tance appears as pa&s;&s;ing before us, it is with difficulty that we &s;uffer the truth of the facts to be que&s;tioned. A hi&s;torian accordingly who hath a genius for narra|tion, &s;eldom fails to engage our belief. The &s;ame facts related in a manner cold and in|di&s;tinct, are not &s;uffered to pa&s;s without ex|amination. A thing ill de&s;cribed, is like an object &s;een at a di&s;tance or through a mi&s;t: we doubt whether it be a reality or a fiction. For this rea&s;on, a poet who can warm and animate his reader, may employ bolder fictions than ought to be ventured by an in|ferior genius. The reader, once thoroughly

engaged, is in that &s;ituation &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions:

<P>In e&s;tabli&s;hing the foregoing theory, the reader has had the fatigue of much dry rea|&s;oning. But his labour will not be fruitle&s;s. From this theory are derived many u&s;eful rules in critici&s;m, which &s;hall be mentioned
<PB N="124" REF="135">
in their proper places. One &s;pecimen, being a fine illu&s;tration, I chu&s;e to give at pre&s;ent. In a hi&s;torical poem repre&s;enting human ac|tions, it is a rule, that no improbable inci|dent ought to be admitted. A circum&s;tance, an incident, or an event, may be &s;ingular, may &s;urpri&s;e by being unexpected, and yet be extremely natural. The improbability I talk of, is that of an irregular fact, contrary to the order and cour&s;e of nature, and there|fore unaccountable. A chain of imagined facts linked together according to the order of nature, find ea&s;y entrance into the mind; and if de&s;cribed with warmth of fancy, they produce complete images, including ideal pre&s;ence. But it is with great difficulty that we admit any irregular fact; for an irregular fact always puzzles the judgement. Doubt|ful of its reality we immediately enter upon reflection, and di&s;covering the cheat, lo&s;e all reli&s;h and concern. This is an unhappy effect; for thereafter it requires more than an ordinary effort, to re&s;tore the waking dream, and to make the reader conceive even the more probable incidents as pa&s;&s;ing in his pre&s;ence.</P>

I never was an admirer of machinery in an epic poem; and I now find my ta&s;te ju|&s;tified by rea&s;on; the foregoing argument concluding &s;till more &s;trongly again&s;t imagi|nary beings, than again&s;t improbable facts. Fictions of this nature may amu&s;e by their no|velty and &s;ingularity: but they never move the &s;ympathetic pa&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e they cannot impo&s;e on the mind any perception of reali|ty. I appeal to the di&s;cerning reader, whe|ther this be not preci&s;ely the ca&s;e of the ma|chinery introduced by Taffo and by Vol|taire. This machinery is not only in it&s;elf cold and unintere&s;ting, but is remarkably hurtful, by giving an air of fiction to the whole compo&s;ition. A burle&s;que poem, &s;uch as the Lutrin or the Di&s;pen&s;ary, may employ machinery with &s;ucce&s;s; for the&s;e poems, though they a&s;&s;ume the air of hi&s;to|ry, give entertainment chiefly by their plea|&s;ant and ludicrous pictures, to which ma|chinery contributes in a &s;ingular manner. It is not the aim of &s;uch a poem, to rai&s;e our &s;ympathy in any con&s;iderable degree; and for that rea&s;on, a &s;trict imitation of na|ture is not required. A poem profe&s;&s;edly
<PB N="126" REF="137">
ludicrous, may employ machinery to great advantage; and the more extravagant the better. A ju&s;t repre&s;entation of nature, would indeed be incongruous in a compo&s;i|tion intended to give entertainment by the means chiefly of &s;ingularity and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>For accompli&s;hing the ta&s;k undertaken in the beginning of the pre&s;ent &s;ection, what only remains is, to &s;how the final cau&s;e of the power that fiction hath over the mind of man. I have already mentioned, that language, by means of fiction, has the command of our &s;ympathy for the good of others. By the &s;ame means, our &s;ympathy may be al&s;o rai&s;ed for our own good. In the third &s;ection it is ob&s;erved, that exam|ples both of virtue and of vice rai&s;e virtuous emotions; which becoming &s;tronger by ex|erci&s;e, tend to make us virtuous by habit as well as by principle. I now further ob|&s;erve, that examples drawn from real events, are not &s;o frequent as to contribute much to a habit of virtue. If they be, they are not re|corded by hi&s;torians. It therefore &s;hows great wi&s;dom, to form us in &s;uch a manner, as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame improvement
<PB N="127" REF="138">
from fable that we receive from genuine hi|&s;tory. By this admirable contrivance, examples to improve us in virtue may be multiplied without end. No other &s;ort of di&s;cipline contributes more to make virtue habitual; and no other &s;ort is &s;o agreeable in the ap|plication. I add another final cau&s;e with thorough &s;atisfaction; becau&s;e it &s;hows, that the author of our nature is not le&s;s kindly provident for the happine&s;s of his creatures, than for the regularity of their conduct. The power that fiction hath over the mind of man, is the &s;ource of an endle&s;s variety of refined amu&s;ement, always ready to em|ploy a vacant hour. Such amu&s;ement is a fine re&s;ource in &s;olitude; and by &s;weeten|ing the temper, improves &s;ociety.</P>

<P>IT will naturally occur at fir&s;t view, that a di&s;cour&s;e upon the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould com|mence
<PB N="128" REF="139">
with explaining the qualities now mentioned. But upon trial, I found this could not be done di&s;tinctly, till the differ|ence were a&s;certained betwixt an emotion and a pa&s;&s;ion, and till their cau&s;es were e|volved.</P>
<P>Great ob&s;curity may be ob&s;erved among writers with regard to the pre&s;ent point. No care, for example, is taken to di&s;tin|gui&s;h agreeable from plea&s;ant, di&s;agreeable from painful; or rather the&s;e terms are deemed &s;ynonymous. This is an error not at all venial in the &s;cience of ethics; as in|&s;tances can and &s;hall be given, of painful pa&s;&s;ions that are agreeable, and of plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions that are di&s;agreeable. The&s;e terms, it is true, are u&s;ed indifferently in familiar conver&s;ations, and in compo&s;ition for amu&s;e|ment, where accuracy is not required. But for tho&s;e to u&s;e them &s;o who profe&s;s to ex|plain the pa&s;&s;ions, is a capital error. In writing upon the critical art, I would avoid every refinement that may &s;eem more cu|rious than u&s;eful. But the proper meaning of the terms under con&s;ideration mu&s;t be a&s;certained, in order to under&s;tand the pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="129" REF="140">
and &s;ome of their effects that are inti|mately connected with critici&s;m.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to explain the&s;e terms by familiar examples. Viewing a fine garden, I perceive it to be beautiful or agreeable; and I con&s;ider the beauty or a|greeablene&s;s as belonging to the object, or as one of its qualities. Again, when I turn my thoughts from the garden to what pa&s;&s;es in my mind, I am con&s;cious of a plea&s;ant emotion of which the garden is the cau&s;e. The plea&s;ure here is felt, not as a quality of the garden, but of the emotion produced by it. I give an oppo&s;ite example. A rot|ten carca&s;s is loath&s;ome and di&s;agreeable, and rai&s;es in the &s;pectator a painful emotion. The di&s;agreeablene&s;s is a quality of the ob|ject: the pain is a quality of the emotion produced by it. Agreeable and di&s;agreeable, then, are qualities of the objects we perceive: plea&s;ant and painful are qualities of the emo|tions we feel. The former qualities are perceived as adhering to objects; the latter are felt as exi&s;ting within us.</P>
<P>But a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion, be&s;ide being felt, is frequently made an object of thought
<PB N="130" REF="141">
or reflection: we examine it; we inquire into its nature, its cau&s;e, and its effects. In this view it partakes the nature of other ob|jects: it is either agreeable or di&s;agreeable. Hence clearly appear the different &s;ignifica|tions of the terms under con&s;ideration, as applied to pa&s;&s;ion. When a pa&s;&s;ion is termed <HI>plea&s;ant</HI> or <HI>painful,</HI> we refer to the actual feeling: when termed <HI>agreeable</HI> or <HI>di&s;agreeable,</HI> it is con&s;idered as an object of thought or reflection. A pa&s;&s;ion is plea&s;ant or painful to the per&s;on in whom it exi&s;ts: it is agreeable or di&s;agreeable to the per&s;on who makes it a &s;ubject of contemplation.</P>
<P>When the terms thus defined are applied to particular emotions and pa&s;&s;ions, they do not always coincide. And in order to make this evident, we mu&s;t endeavour to a&s;certain, fir&s;t, what pa&s;&s;ions and emotions are plea&s;ant what painful, and next, what are agreeable what di&s;agreeable. With re&s;pect to both, there are general rules, which, &s;o far as I gather from induction, admit not any ex|ceptions. The nature of an emotion or pa&s;|&s;ion as plea&s;ant or painful, depends entirely on its cau&s;e. An agreeable object produceth
<PB N="131" REF="142">
always a plea&s;ant emotion; and a di&s;agreeable object produceth always a painful emotion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part 7. of this chapter.</NOTE>. Thus a lofty oak, a generous action, a va|luable di&s;covery in art or &s;cience, are agree|able objects that unerringly produce plea&s;ant emotions. A &s;tinking puddle, a treache|rous action, an irregular ill-contrived edi|fice, being di&s;agreeable objects, produce painful emotions. Selfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions are plea|&s;ant; for they ari&s;e from &s;elf, an agreeable object or cau&s;e. A &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion directed upon an agreeable object is always plea&s;ant: directed upon an object in di&s;tre&s;s, is pain|ful<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the place above cited.</NOTE>. La&s;tly, all di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as envy, re&s;entment, malice, being cau&s;ed by di&s;agreeable objects, cannot fail to be pain|ful.</P>
<P>It requires a greater compa&s;s to evolve the general rule that concerns the agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agreeablene&s;s of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions. An action conformable to the common na|ture of our &s;pecies, is perceived by us to be
<PB N="132" REF="143">
regular and good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 1. e&s;&s;. 2. chap. 1.</NOTE>; and con&s;equently eve|ry &s;uch action appears agreeable to us. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to pa&s;&s;ions and emotions. Every feeling that is conform|able to the common nature of our &s;pecies, is perceived by us to be regular and as it ought to be; and upon that account it mu&s;t appear agreeable. By this general rule we can a&s;certain what emotions are agreeable what di&s;agreeable. Every emotion that is conformable to the common nature of man, ought to appear agreeable. And that this holds true with re&s;pect to plea&s;ant emotions, will readily be admitted. But why &s;hould painful emotions be an exception, when they are not le&s;s natural than the other? The propo&s;ition holds true in both. Thus the painful emotion rai&s;ed by a mon&s;trous birth or brutal action, is not le&s;s agreeable upon reflection, than the plea&s;ant emotion rai&s;ed by a flowing river or a lofty dome. With re&s;pect to pa&s;&s;ions as oppo&s;ed to emotions, it will be obvious from the foregoing propo|&s;ition, that their agreeablene&s;s or di&s;agree|ablene&s;s,
<PB N="133" REF="144">
like the actions of which they are productive, mu&s;t be regulated entirely by the moral &s;en&s;e. Every action vicious or improper is di&s;agreeable to a &s;pectator, and &s;o is the pa&s;&s;ion that prompts it. Every ac|tion virtuous or proper is agreeable to a &s;pec|tator, and &s;o is the pa&s;&s;ion that prompts it.</P>
<P>This deduction may be carried a great way farther; but to avoid intricacy and ob|&s;curity, I make but one other &s;tep. A pa&s;|&s;ion, which, as afore&s;aid, becomes an ob|ject of thought to a &s;pectator, may have the effect to produce a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion in him; for it is natural that a &s;ocial being &s;hould be affected with the pa&s;&s;ions of others. Pa&s;&s;ions or emotions thus generated, &s;ub|mit, in common with others, to the gene|ral law above mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> that an agree|able object produces a plea&s;ant emotion, and a di&s;agreeable object a painful emotion. Thus the pa&s;&s;ion of gratitude, being to a &s;pectator an agreeable object, produceth in him the plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ion of love to the grate|ful per&s;on. Thus malice, being to a &s;pec|tator a di&s;agreeable object, produceth in
<PB N="134" REF="145">
him the painful pa&s;&s;ion of hatred to the ma|licious per&s;on.</P>
<P>We are now prepared for examples of plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions that are di&s;agreeable, and of painful pa&s;&s;ions that are agreeable. Self-love, &s;o long as confined within ju&s;t bounds, is a pa&s;&s;ion both plea&s;ant and agreeable. In exce&s;s it is di&s;agreeable, though it continues to be &s;till plea&s;ant. Our appetites are pre|ci&s;ely in the &s;ame condition. Again, vanity, though plea&s;ant, is di&s;agreeable. Re&s;ent|ment, on the other hand, is, in every &s;tage of the pa&s;&s;ion, painful; but is not di&s;agreeable unle&s;s in exce&s;s. Pity is always painful, yet always agreeable. But however di&s;tinct the&s;e qualities are, they coincide, I acknow|ledge, in one cla&s;s of pa&s;&s;ions. All vicious pa&s;&s;ions tending to the hurt of others, are equally painful and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The foregoing di&s;tinctions among pa&s;|&s;ions and emotions, may &s;erve the common affairs of life, but they are not &s;ufficient for the critical art. The qualities of plea&s;ant and painful are too familiar to carry us far into human nature, or to form an accurate judgement in the fine arts. It is further
<PB N="135" REF="146">
nece&s;&s;ary, that we be made acquainted with the &s;everal modifications of the&s;e qualities, with the modifications at lea&s;t that make the greate&s;t figure. Even at fir&s;t view every one is &s;en&s;ible, that the plea&s;ure or pain of one pa&s;&s;ion differs from that of an|other. How di&s;tant the plea&s;ure of revenge from that of love? So di&s;tant, as that we cannot without reluctance admit them to be any way related. That the &s;ame qua|lity of plea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;o differently mo|dified in different pa&s;&s;ions, will not be &s;ur|pri&s;ing, when we reflect on the boundle&s;s variety of plea&s;ant &s;ounds, ta&s;tes, and &s;mells, daily felt. Our di&s;cernment reaches differ|ences &s;till more nice, in objects even of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. We have no difficulty to di&s;|tingui&s;h different &s;weets, different &s;ours, and different bitters. Honey is &s;weet, and &s;o is &s;ugar; and yet they never pa&s;s the one for the other. Our &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is &s;uf|ficiently acute, to di&s;tingui&s;h varieties in &s;weet-&s;melling flowers without end. With re&s;pect to pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, their dif|ferent feelings have no limits; for when we attempt the more delicate modifications,
<PB N="136" REF="147">
they elude our &s;earch, and are &s;carce di&s;cern|ible. In this matter, however, there is an analogy betwixt our internal and external &s;en&s;es. The latter generally are &s;ufficiently acute for all the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of life, and &s;o are the former. Some per&s;ons indeed, Nature's favourites, have a wonderful a|cutene&s;s of &s;en&s;e, which to them unfolds many a delightful &s;cene totally hid from vulgar eyes. But if &s;uch refined plea&s;ure be refu&s;ed to the bulk of mankind, it is however wi&s;ely ordered that they are not &s;en&s;ible of the defect; and it detracts not from their happine&s;s that others &s;ecretly are more happy. With relation to the fine arts only, this qualification &s;eems e&s;&s;ential; and there it is termed <HI>delicacy of ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>Should an author of &s;uch a ta&s;te attempt to de&s;cribe all tho&s;e differences and &s;hades of plea&s;ant and painful emotions which he him&s;elf feels, he would &s;oon meet an in|vincible ob&s;tacle in the poverty of language. No known tongue hitherto has reached &s;uch perfection, as to expre&s;s clearly the more delicate feelings. A people mu&s;t be thoroughly refined, before their language
<PB N="137" REF="148">
become &s;o comprehen&s;ive. We mu&s;t there|fore re&s;t &s;atisfied with an explanation of the more obvious modifications.</P>
<P>In forming a compari&s;on betwixt plea|&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions of different kinds, we conceive &s;ome of them to be <HI>gro&s;s</HI> &s;ome <HI>refined.</HI> Tho&s;e plea&s;ures of external &s;en&s;e that are felt as at the organ of &s;en&s;e, are con|ceived to be corporeal or gro&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the introduction.</NOTE>. The plea&s;ures of the eye and ear are felt to be internal; and for that rea&s;on are conceived to be more pure and refined.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial affections are conceived by all to be more refined than the &s;elfi&s;h. Sym|pathy and humanity are reckoned the fine&s;t temper of mind; and for that rea&s;on, the prevalence of the &s;ocial affections in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, is held to be a refine|ment in our nature. A &s;avage is unquali|fied for any plea&s;ure but what is thoroughly or nearly &s;elfi&s;h: therefore a &s;avage is incapable of comparing &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ocial plea&s;ure. But a man after acquiring a high reli&s;h of the latter, lo&s;es not thereby a ta&s;te for the former. This man can judge, and he
<PB N="138" REF="149">
will give preference to &s;ocial plea&s;ures as more &s;weet and refined. In fact they maintain that character, not only in the di|rect feeling, but al&s;o when we make them the &s;ubject of reflection. The &s;ocial pa&s;|&s;ions are by far more agreeable than the &s;elfi&s;h, and ri&s;e much higher in our e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Refined manners and polite behaviour, mu&s;t not be deemed altogether artificial. Men accu&s;tomed to the &s;weets of &s;ociety, who cultivate humanity, find an elegant plea&s;ure in preferring others and making them happy, of which the proud or &s;elfi&s;h &s;carce have a conception.</P>
<P>Ridicule, which chiefly ari&s;es from pride, a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, is at be&s;t but a gro&s;s plea|&s;ure. A people, it is true, mu&s;t have e|merged out of barbarity before they can have a ta&s;te for ridicule. But it is too rough an entertainment for tho&s;e who are highly poli&s;hed and refined. Ridicule is bani&s;hed France, and is lo&s;ing ground daily in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Other modifications of plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ions will be occa&s;ionally mentioned hereafter. Particularly the modifications of <HI>high</HI> and <HI>low</HI>

<HEAD>PART III. Interrupted exi&s;tence of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Their growth and decay.</HEAD>
<P>WEre emotions of the &s;ame nature with colour and figure, to continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate till varied by &s;ome o|perating cau&s;e, the condition of man would be deplorable. It is ordered wi&s;ely, that e|motions &s;hould more re&s;emble another attri|bute of matter, <HI>viz.</HI> motion, which requires the con&s;tant exertion of an operating cau&s;e, and cea&s;es when the cau&s;e is withdrawn. An emotion may &s;ub&s;i&s;t while its cau&s;e is pre&s;ent; and when its cau&s;e is re|moved, may &s;ub&s;i&s;t by means of an idea, though in a fainter degree. But the mo|ment another thought breaks in and occu|pies the mind, &s;o as to exclude not only this cau&s;e, but al&s;o its idea, the emotion
<PB N="140" REF="151">
is gone: it is no longer felt. If it return with its cau&s;e or idea, it again vani&s;h|eth with them when other thoughts crowd in. This ob&s;ervation is applicable to emo|tions and pa&s;&s;ions of every kind. And the&s;e accordingly are connected with perceptions and ideas, &s;o intimately as not to have any independent exi&s;tence. A &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, it is true, hath a mighty influence to detain its object in the mind; but not &s;o as to detain it for ever. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions or ideas is unavoidable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this point explained afterwards, chap. 9.</NOTE>: the object of the pa&s;&s;ion may be often recalled; but how|ever intere&s;ting, it mu&s;t by intervals yield to other objects. For this rea&s;on, a pa&s;&s;ion rarely continues long with an equal degree of vigour. It is felt &s;trong and moderate, in a pretty quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame object makes not always the &s;ame impre&s;|&s;ion; becau&s;e the mind, being of a limited capacity, cannot, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, give great attention to a plurality of objects. The &s;trength of a pa&s;&s;ion depends on the impre&s;&s;ion made by its cau&s;e; and a cau&s;e
<PB N="141" REF="152">
makes its &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, when hap|pening to be the &s;ingle intere&s;ting object, it attracts our whole attention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms, &s;ect. 33.</NOTE>. Its impre&s;|&s;ion is &s;lighter when our attention is divided betwixt it and other objects; and at that time the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;lighter in proportion.</P>
<P>When emotions and pa&s;&s;ions are felt thus by intervals and have not a continued ex|i&s;tence, it may be thought a nice problem, to a&s;certain their identity, and to deter|mine when they are the &s;ame when differ|ent. In a &s;trict philo&s;ophic view, every &s;ingle impre&s;&s;ion made even by the &s;ame object, is di&s;tingui&s;hable from what have gone before, and from what &s;ucceed. Nei|ther is an emotion rai&s;ed by an idea the &s;ame with what is rai&s;ed by a &s;ight of the object. But &s;uch accuracy is not found in common apprehen&s;ion, nor is nece&s;&s;ary in common language. The emotions rai&s;ed by a fine land&s;cape in its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive appearan|ces, are not di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, nor even from tho&s;e rai&s;ed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="142" REF="153">
ideas of the object: all of them are held to be the &s;ame. A pa&s;&s;ion al&s;o is always rec|koned the &s;ame, &s;o long as it is fixed upon the &s;ame object. Thus love and hatred may continue the &s;ame for life. Nay, &s;o loo&s;e are we in this way of thinking, that many pa&s;&s;ions are reckoned the &s;ame even after a change of object. This is the ca&s;e of all pa&s;&s;ions that proceed from &s;ome pe|culiar propen&s;ity. Envy, for example, is con&s;idered to be the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, not only while it is directed upon the &s;ame per&s;on, but even where it comprehends many per|&s;ons at once. Pride and malice are in the &s;ame condition. So much was nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid upon the identity of a pa&s;&s;ion and emotion, in order to prepare for examining their growth and decay.</P>
<P>The growth and decay of pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, is a &s;ubject too exten&s;ive to be exhau&s;ted in an undertaking like the pre|&s;ent. I pretend only to give a cur&s;ory view of it, &s;o far as nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of critici&s;m. Some emotions are produced in their utmo&s;t perfection, and have a very &s;hort endurance. This is the ca&s;e of &s;ur|pri&s;e,
<PB N="143" REF="154">
of wonder, and &s;ometimes of terror. Emotions rai&s;ed by in&s;en&s;ible objects, &s;uch as trees, rivers, buildings, pictures, arrive at perfection almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and have a long endurance: a &s;econd view pro|duceth nearly the &s;ame plea&s;ure with the fir&s;t. Love, hatred, and &s;ome other pa&s;|&s;ions, increa&s;e gradually to a certain pitch, and thereafter decay gradually. Envy, ma|lice, pride, &s;carce ever decay. Again, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as gratitude and revenge, are often exhau&s;ted by a &s;ingle act of gratifica|tion. Other pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as pride, ma|lice, envy, love, hatred, are not &s;o ex|hau&s;ted; but having a long continuance, demand frequent gratification.</P>
<P>In order to explain the&s;e differences, it would be an endle&s;s work to examine every emotion and pa&s;&s;ion in particular. We mu&s;t be &s;atisfied at pre&s;ent with &s;ome general views. And with re&s;pect to emotions, which are quie&s;cent and not productive of de&s;ire, their growth and decay are ea&s;ily explained. An emotion cau&s;ed by an exter|nal object, cannot naturally take longer time to arrive at perfection, than is nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="144" REF="155">
a lei&s;urely &s;urvey. Such emotion al&s;o mu&s;t continue long &s;tationary, without any &s;en&s;i|ble decay; a &s;econd or third view of the object being nearly as agreeable as the fir&s;t. This is the ca&s;e of an emotion produced by a fine pro&s;pect, an impetuous river, or a towering hill. While a man remains the &s;ame, &s;uch objects ought to have the &s;ame effect upon him. Familiarity, however, hath an influence here, as it hath every where. Frequency of view, after &s;hort intervals e&s;pe|cially, weans the mind gradually from the object, which at la&s;t lo&s;es all reli&s;h. The noble&s;t object in the material world, a clear and &s;erene &s;ky, is quite di&s;regarded, unle&s;s perhaps after a cour&s;e of bad weather. An emotion rai&s;ed by human virtues, qualities, or actions, may grow imperceptibly by re|iterated views of the object, till it become &s;o vigorous as to generate de&s;ire. In this condition it mu&s;t be handled as a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to pa&s;&s;ion, I ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that when nature requires a pa&s;&s;ion to be &s;udden, it is commonly produced in perfection. This is frequently the ca&s;e of fear and of anger. Wonder and &s;urpri&s;e are always produced
<PB N="145" REF="156">
in perfection. Reiterated impre&s;&s;ions made by their cau&s;e, exhau&s;t the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in place of inflaming them. This will be ex|plained afterward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the next place, when a pa&s;&s;ion hath for its foundation an original propen&s;ity pe|culiar to &s;ome men, it generally comes &s;oon to perfection. The propen&s;ity, upon repre|&s;enting a proper object, is immediately en|livened into a pa&s;&s;ion. This is the ca&s;e of pride, of envy, and of malice.</P>
<P>In the third place, love and hatred have often a &s;low growth. The good qualities or kind offices of a per&s;on, rai&s;e in me plea|&s;ant emotions; which, by reiterated views, are &s;welled into a pa&s;&s;ion involving de&s;ire of that per&s;on's happine&s;s. This de&s;ire being often put in exerci&s;e, works gradually a change internally; and at la&s;t produceth in me a &s;ettled habit of affection for that per|&s;on, now my friend. Affection thus produ|ced, operates preci&s;ely like an original pro|pen&s;ity. To enliven it into a pa&s;&s;ion, no more is required but the real or ideal pre|&s;ence
<PB N="146" REF="157">
of the object. The habit of aver&s;ion or hatred is brought on in the &s;ame manner. And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the way, that love and hatred &s;ignify commonly affection, not pa&s;&s;ion. The bulk indeed of our pa&s;|&s;ions, are the&s;e affections inflamed into a pa&s;&s;ion by different circum&s;tances. The affection of love I bear to my &s;on, is infla|med into the pa&s;&s;ion of fear, when he is in danger; becomes hope, when he hath a pro&s;pect of good fortune; becomes admira|tion, when he performs a laudable action; and &s;hame, when he commits any wrong. Aver&s;ion, again, becomes fear when there is a pro&s;pect of good fortune to my enemy; be|comes hope when he is in danger; becomes joy when he is in di&s;tre&s;s; and &s;orrow when a laudable action is performed by him.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the growth of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions depends often on occa&s;ional circum&s;tances. Ob&s;tacles to gratification never fail to aug|ment and inflame a pa&s;&s;ion. A con&s;tant endeavour to remove the ob&s;tacle, pre&s;erves the object of the pa&s;&s;ion ever in view, which &s;wells the pa&s;&s;ion by impre&s;&s;ions frequently reiterated. Thus the re&s;traint of con&s;cience,
<PB N="147" REF="158">
when an ob&s;tacle to love, agitates the mind and inflames the pa&s;&s;ion:
<Q><L>Quod licet, ingratum e&s;t: quod non licet, acrius urit.</L>
<L>Si nunquam Dana&euml;n habui&s;&s;et ahenea turris,</L>
<L>Non e&s;&s;et Dana&euml; de Jove facta parens.</L>
<BIBL>Ovid. Amor. l. 2.</BIBL></Q>
At the &s;ame time, the mind di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the ob&s;tacle, is di&s;po&s;ed to indulge its di|&s;tre&s;s by magnifying the plea&s;ure of gratifi|cation; which naturally inflames de&s;ire. Shake&s;pear expre&s;&s;es this ob&s;ervation finely:
<Q><L>All impediments in fancy's cour&s;e,</L>
<L>Are motives of more fancy.</L></Q>
We need no better example than a lover who hath many rivals. Even the caprices of a mi&s;tre&s;s have the effect to inflame love. The&s;e occa&s;ioning uncertainty of &s;ucce&s;s, tend naturally to make the anxious lover overvalue the happine&s;s of fruition.</P>
<P>So much upon the growth of pa&s;&s;ions. Their continuance and decay come next under con&s;ideration. And fir&s;t, it is a ge|neral
<PB N="148" REF="159">
law of nature, that things &s;udden in their growth, are equally &s;udden in their decay. This is commonly the ca&s;e of an|ger; and with re&s;pect to wonder and &s;ur|pri&s;e, another rea&s;on concurs, that their cau&s;es are of &s;hort duration. Novelty &s;oon degenerates into familiarity; and the un|expectedne&s;s of an object, is &s;oon &s;unk in the plea&s;ure which the object affords us. Fear, which is a pa&s;&s;ion of greater import|ance as tending to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, is often in&s;tantaneous, and yet is of equal duration with its cau&s;e. Nay it frequently &s;ub&s;i&s;ts after the cau&s;e is removed.</P>
<P>In the next place, a pa&s;&s;ion founded on a peculiar propen&s;ity, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts generally for ever. This is the ca&s;e of pride, envy, and malice. Objects are never wanting, to in|flame the propen&s;ity into a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it may be laid down as a gene|ral law of nature, that every pa&s;&s;ion cea&s;es upon attaining its ultimate end. To explain this law, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a par|ticular and a general end. I call a particu|lar end what may be accompli&s;hed by a &s;in|gle act. A general end, on the contrary,
<PB N="149" REF="160">
admits acts without number; becau&s;e it cannot be &s;aid that a general end is ever fully accompli&s;hed while the object of the pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Gratitude and revenge are examples of the fir&s;t kind. The ends they aim at may be accompli&s;hed by a &s;ingle act; and when this act is performed, the pa&s;&s;ions are nece&s;&s;arily at an end. Love and hatred are examples of the other kind. The de&s;ire of doing good or of doing mi&s;chief to an individual, is a general end, which admits acts without number, and which &s;eldom is fully accompli&s;hed. Therefore the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions have frequently the &s;ame duration with their objects.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it will afford us another general view, to con&s;ider the difference betwixt an original propen&s;ity and an affection produ|ced by cu&s;tom. The former adheres too clo&s;e to the con&s;titution ever to be eradica|ted; and for that rea&s;on the pa&s;&s;ions to which it gives birth, endure during life with no remarkable diminution of &s;trength. The latter, which owes its birth and increment to time, owes its decay to the &s;ame cau&s;e. Affection decays gradually as it grew. Hence long
<PB N="150" REF="161">
ab&s;ence extingui&s;heth hatred as well as love. Affection wears out more gradually betwixt per&s;ons, who, living together, are objects to each other of mutual good-will and kindne&s;s. But here habit comes in luckily, to &s;upply decayed affection. It makes the&s;e per&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of each other, by the pain of &s;epara|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 14.</NOTE>. Affection to children hath a long endurance, longer perhaps than any other affection. Its growth keeps pace with that of its objects. They di&s;play new beauties and qualifications daily, to feed and aug|ment the affection. But whenever the af|fection becomes &s;tationary, it mu&s;t begin to decay; with a &s;low pace indeed, in propor|tion to its increment. In &s;hort, man with re&s;pect to this life, is a temporary being. He grows, becomes &s;tationary, decays; and &s;o mu&s;t all his powers and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. Coexi&s;tent emotions and pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>TO have a thorough knowledge of the human pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, it is not &s;ufficient that they be examined &s;ingly and &s;eparately. As a plurality of them are &s;ome|times felt at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the manner of their coexi&s;tence, and the effects there|by produced, ought al&s;o to be examined. This &s;ubject is exten&s;ive, and it will be diffi|cult to evolve all the laws that govern its endle&s;s variety of ca&s;es. Such an underta|king may be brought to perfection, but it mu&s;t be by degrees. The following hints may &s;uffice for a fir&s;t attempt.</P>
<P>We begin with emotions rai&s;ed by different &s;ounds, as the &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e. Two &s;ounds that mix, and are, as it were, incorporated before they reach the ear, are &s;aid to be concordant. That each &s;ound produceth an emotion of its own, mu&s;t be admitted. But then the&s;e emotions, like the &s;ounds
<PB N="152" REF="163">
that produce them, mix &s;o intimately, as to be rather one complex emotion than two emotions in conjunction. Two &s;ounds, again, that refu&s;e incorporation or mixture, are &s;aid to be di&s;cordant. Being however heard at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the emotions produced by them are conjoined; and in that condi|tion are unplea&s;ant, even where &s;eparately they are each of them plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Similar to the emotion rai&s;ed by mixed &s;ounds, is the emotion that an object of &s;ight rai&s;es by means of its &s;everal qualities. A tree, for example, with its qualities of colour, figure, &s;ize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is perceived to be one ob|ject; and the emotion it rai&s;es is one, not different emotions combined. But though the emotion be one, it is however not &s;im|ple. The perception of the tree is complex, and the emotion rai&s;ed by it mu&s;t al&s;o be complex.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to coexi&s;tent emotions pro|duced by different cau&s;es or objects, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that there cannot be a con|cordance among objects of &s;ight like what is perceived in &s;ounds. Objects of &s;ight are never mixed or incorporated in the act of
<PB N="153" REF="164">
vi&s;ion. Each object is perceived as it exi&s;ts, &s;eparately from others; and each rai&s;eth its own emotion, which is felt di&s;tinctly how|ever intimately connected the objects may be. This doctrine holds in all the cau&s;es of emotion or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ounds only excepted.</P>
<P>To explain the manner in which &s;uch emotions coexi&s;t, &s;imilar emotions mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that are di&s;&s;imilar. Two emotions are &s;aid to be &s;imilar, when they tend each of them to produce the &s;ame tone of mind. Chearful emotions, however different their cau&s;es may be, are &s;imilar; and &s;o are tho&s;e which are melan|choly. Di&s;&s;imilar emotions are ea&s;ily ex|plained by their oppo&s;ition to what are &s;imi|lar. Grandeur and littlene&s;s, gaiety and gloomine&s;s, are di&s;&s;imilar emotions.</P>
<P>Emotions perfectly &s;imilar, readily com|bine and unite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ea&s;ier to conceive the manner of coexi&s;tence of &s;i|milar emotions, than to de&s;cribe it. They cannot be &s;aid to mix or incorporate like concordant &s;ounds. Their union is rather of agreement or concord; and therefore I have cho&s;en the words in the text, not as &s;ufficient to expre&s;s clearly the manner of their coexi&s;tence, but only as le&s;s liable to excep|tion than any other I can find.</NOTE>, &s;o as in a manner to be|come

one complex emotion; witne&s;s the emotions produced by a number of flowers in a parterre, or of trees in a wood. Emo|tions again that are oppo&s;ite or extremely di&s;&s;imilar, never combine nor unite. The mind cannot &s;imultaneou&s;ly take on oppo&s;ite tones: it cannot at the &s;ame in&s;tant be both joyful and &s;ad, angry and &s;atisfied, proud and humble. Di&s;&s;imilar emotions may &s;uc|ceed each other with rapidity, but they can|not exi&s;t &s;imultaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Betwixt the&s;e two extremes, emotions will unite more or le&s;s, in proportion to the degree of their re&s;emblance and the greater or le&s;s connection of their cau&s;es. The beauty of a land&s;cape and the &s;inging of birds, produce emotions that are &s;imilar in a con&s;iderable degree; and the&s;e emotions therefore, though proceeding from very different cau&s;es, readily combine and unite. On the other hand, when the cau&s;es are in|timately connected, the emotions, though but &s;lightly re&s;embling each other, are for|ced into a &s;ort of union. I give for an ex|ample a mi&s;tre&s;s in di&s;tre&s;s. When I con&s;i|der her beauty, I feel a plea&s;ant emotion;
<PB N="155" REF="166">
and a painful emotion when I con&s;ider her di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e two emotions, proceeding from different views of the object, have ve|ry little re&s;emblance to each other: and yet their cau&s;es are &s;o intimately connected, as to force them into a &s;ort of complex emo|tion, partly plea&s;ant partly painful. This clearly explains &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions common in poetry, <HI>a &s;weet di&s;tre&s;s, a plea&s;ant pain.</HI></P>
<P>We proceed to the effects produced by means of the different manners of coexi&s;t|ence above de&s;cribed; fir&s;t, the effects pro|duced within the mind, and next, tho&s;e that appear externally. I di&s;cover two mental effects clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other. The one may be repre&s;ented by addition and &s;ubtraction in numbers, and the other by harmony in &s;ounds. Two plea&s;ant emotions that are &s;imilar, readily unite when they are coexi&s;tent; and the plea&s;ure felt in the union, is the &s;um of the two plea&s;ures. The combined emotions are like multiplied effects from the co-ope|ration of different powers. The &s;ame e|motions in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are far from making the &s;ame figure; becau&s;e the mind at no
<PB N="156" REF="167">
in&s;tant of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is con&s;cious of more than a &s;ingle emotion. This doctrine may aptly be illu&s;trated by a land&s;cape com|prehending hills, vallies, plains, rivers, trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The emotions produced by the&s;e &s;everal objects, being &s;imilar in a high degree as falling in ea&s;ily and &s;weetly with the &s;ame tone of mind, are in conjunction extremely plea&s;ant. And this multiplied effect is felt from objects even of different &s;en&s;es; as where a land&s;cape is conjoined with the mu&s;ic of birds and odor of flowers. Such multiplied effect, as above hinted, de|pends partly on the re&s;emblance of the e|motions and partly on the connection of their cau&s;es; whence it follows, that the effect mu&s;t be the greate&s;t, where the cau&s;es are intimately connected and the emotions perfectly &s;imilar.</P>
<P>The other plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from coexi&s;tent emotions, which may be termed <HI>the plea|&s;ure of concord or harmony,</HI> is a&s;certained by a different rule. It is directly in proportion to the degree of re&s;emblance betwixt the emotions, and inver&s;ely in proportion to the degree of connection betwixt the cau|&s;es.
<PB N="157" REF="168">
To feel this plea&s;ure in perfection, the re&s;emblance cannot be too &s;trong, nor the connection too &s;light. Where the cau&s;es are intimately connected, the &s;imilar emo|tions they produce are felt like one com|plex emotion. But the plea&s;ure of harmo|ny, is not felt from one emotion &s;ingle or complex. It is felt from various &s;imilar e|motions, di&s;tinct from each other, and yet &s;weetly combining in the mind; and the le&s;s connection the cau&s;es have, the more entire is the emotion of harmony. This matter cannot be better illu&s;trated, than by the foregoing example of a land&s;cape, where the &s;ight, hearing, and &s;melling, are employed. The accumulated plea&s;ure of &s;o many different &s;imilar emotions, is not what delights us the mo&s;t in this combina|tion of objects. The &s;en&s;e of harmony from the&s;e emotions &s;weetly uniting in the mind, is &s;till more delightful. We feel this harmony in the different emotions proceed|ing from the vi&s;ible objects; but we feel it &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly in the emotions proceed|ing from the objects of different &s;en&s;es. This emotion of concord or harmony, will
<PB N="158" REF="169">
be more fully illu&s;trated, when the emo|tions produced by the &s;ound of words and their meaning are taken under con&s;idera|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 18. &s;ect. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This emotion of concord from conjoined emotions, is felt even where the emotions are not perfectly &s;imilar. Love is a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ion; but then its &s;weetne&s;s and tender|ne&s;s make it re&s;emble in a con&s;iderable de|gree the painful pa&s;&s;ion of pity or grief; and for that rea&s;on, love accords better with the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions than with what are gay and &s;prightly. I give the following ex|ample from Catullus, where the concord be|twixt love and grief, has a fine effect even in &s;o &s;light a &s;ubject as the death of a &s;parrow.

<P>To complete this branch of the &s;ubject, I proceed to con&s;ider the effects of di&s;&s;imi|lar emotions. The&s;e effects obviou&s;ly mu&s;t be oppo&s;ite to what are above de&s;cribed; and in order to explain them with accuracy, di&s;&s;imilar emotions proceeding from con|nected cau&s;es, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from what proceed from cau&s;es that are un|connected. Di&s;&s;imilar emotions of the former kind, being forced into a &s;ort of unnatural union, produce a feeling of di&s;|cord in&s;tead of harmony. It holds al&s;o that in computing their force, &s;ubtraction mu&s;t be u&s;ed in place of addition, which will be evi|dent from what follows. Di&s;&s;imilar emotions forced into union, are felt ob&s;curely and im|perfectly;

for each tends to vary the tone of mind that is &s;uited to the other; and the mind thus di&s;tracted betwixt two objects, is at no in&s;tant in a condition to receive a full impre&s;&s;ion from either. Di&s;&s;imilar e|motions proceeding from unconnected cau|&s;es, are in a very different condition. Di&s;&s;i|milar emotions in general are aver&s;e to u|nion; and as there is nothing to force them into union when their cau&s;es are uncon|nected, emotions of this kind are never felt but in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. By that means, they are not felt to be di&s;cordant, and each hath an opportunity to make a full impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This curious theory mu&s;t be illu&s;trated by examples. In reading the de&s;cription of the di&s;mal wa&s;te, book 1. of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> we are &s;en&s;ible of a confu&s;ed feeling, ari|&s;ing from di&s;&s;imilar emotions forced into union, <HI>viz.</HI> the beauty of the de&s;cription and the horror of the object de&s;cribed.

Many other pa&s;&s;ages in this ju&s;tly celebrated poem produce the &s;ame effect; and we al|ways ob&s;erve, that if the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the &s;ubject be ob&s;cured by the beautiful de&s;cription, this beauty is not le&s;s ob&s;cured by its di&s;cordant union with the di&s;agree|ablene&s;s of the &s;ubject. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on, a&s;cending &s;moke in a calm morning is improper in a picture full of violent action. The emotion of &s;tillne&s;s and tranquillity in|&s;pired by the former, accords not with the lively and animated emotion in&s;pired by the latter. A parterre, partly ornamented partly in di&s;order, produces a mixt feeling of the &s;ame &s;ort. Two great armies in act to engage, mix the di&s;&s;imilar emotions of grandeur and of terror.

A virtuous man has drawn on him&s;elf a great misfortune, by a fault incident to hu|man nature, and therefore venial. The remor&s;e he feels aggravates his di&s;tre&s;s, and con&s;equently rai&s;es our pity to a high pitch. We indeed blame the man; and the in|dignation rai&s;ed by the fault he has com|mitted, is di&s;&s;imilar to pity. The&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions however proceeding from different views of the &s;ame object, are forced into a &s;ort of union. But the indignation is &s;o &s;light as &s;carce to be felt in the mixture with pity. Subjects of this kind, are of all the fitte&s;t for tragedy.

Oppo&s;ite emotions are &s;o di&s;&s;imilar as not to admit any &s;ort of union, even where they proceed from cau&s;es the mo&s;t inti|mately connected. Love to a mi&s;tre&s;s, and re&s;entment for her infidelity, are of this nature. They cannot exi&s;t otherwi&s;e than in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which by the connection of their cau&s;es is commonly rapid. And the&s;e emotions will govern alternately, till one of them obtain the a&s;cendent, or both be ob|literated. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion opens to me by the death of a worthy man, who was my friend as well as my kin&s;man. When I think of my friend I am grieved; but the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion gives me joy. The&s;e two cau&s;es are inti|mately connected, for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is the direct con&s;equence of my friend's death. The emotions however being oppo&s;ite, do not mix: they prevail alternately, perhaps for a cour&s;e of time, till grief for my friend's death be bani&s;hed by the plea&s;ures of opulence. A virtuous man &s;uffering un|ju&s;tly, is an example of the &s;ame kind. I pity him, and I have great indignation at the author of the wrong. The&s;e emotions proceed from cau&s;es nearly connected; but being directed upon different objects, they

If the emotions be unequal in force, the &s;tronger after a conflict will extingui&s;h the weaker. Thus the lo&s;s of a hou&s;e by fire or of a &s;um of money by bankruptcy, will make no figure in oppo&s;ition to the birth of a long-expected &s;on, who is to inherit an opulent fortune. After &s;ome &s;light vibra|tions, the mind &s;ettles in joy, and the lo&s;s is forgot.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations, will be found of great u&s;e in the fine arts. Many practi|cal rules are derived from them, which I
<PB N="166" REF="177">
&s;hall have occa&s;ion afterward to mention. For in&s;tant &s;atisfaction in part, I propo&s;e to &s;how the u&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations in mu&s;ic, a theme I in&s;i&s;t upon at pre&s;ent, not being certain of another opportunity more favour|able. It will be admitted, that no combi|nation of &s;ounds but what is agreeable to the ear, is intitled to the name of mu&s;ic. Melody and harmony are &s;eparately agree|able and in union delightful. The agree|ablene&s;s of vocal mu&s;ic differs from that of in&s;trumental. The former being intended to accompany words, ought to be expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;entiment that is conveyed by the words. But the latter having no connec|tion with words, may be agreeable without expre&s;&s;ing any &s;entiment. Harmony pro|perly &s;o called, though delightful when in perfection, is not expre&s;&s;ive of &s;entiment; and we often find good melody without the lea&s;t tincture of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries being e&s;tabli&s;hed, I proceed directly to the point. In vocal mu|&s;ic, the intimate connection of &s;en&s;e and &s;ound rejects di&s;&s;imilar emotions, tho&s;e e&s;pe|cially that are oppo&s;ite. Similar emotions
<PB N="167" REF="178">
produced by the &s;en&s;e and &s;ound go natu|rally into union; and at the &s;ame time are felt to be concordant or harmonious. Di&s;|&s;imilar emotions, on the other hand, forced into union by cau&s;es intimately connected, not only ob&s;cure each other, but are al&s;o unplea&s;ant by di&s;cordance. From the&s;e principles it is ea&s;y to &s;ay what &s;ort of poe|tical compo&s;itions are fitted for mu&s;ic. It is evident that no poem expre&s;&s;ing the &s;enti|ments of any di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ion is proper. The pain a man feels who is actuated with malice or unju&s;t revenge, di&s;qualifies him for reli&s;hing mu&s;ic or any thing that is en|tertaining. And &s;uppo&s;ing him di&s;po&s;ed, again&s;t nature, to vent his &s;entiments in mu&s;ic, the mixture would be unplea|&s;ant; for the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;e di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion in the audience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part 2. of the pre&s;ent chapter, toward the clo&s;e.</NOTE>, a tone of mind oppo&s;ite to every emotion that mu&s;ic can in|&s;pire. A man &s;eized with remor&s;e cannot bear mu&s;ic, becau&s;e every &s;ort of it mu&s;t be di&s;cordant with his tone of mind; and when the&s;e by an un&s;kilful arti&s;t are forced into
<PB N="168" REF="179">
union, the mixture is unplea&s;ant to the au|dience.</P>
<P>In general, mu&s;ic never can have a good effect in conjunction with any compo|&s;ition expre&s;&s;ive of malice, envy, peevi&s;h|ne&s;s, or any other di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ion. The plea&s;ure of mu&s;ic, on the other hand, is &s;i|milar to all plea&s;ant emotions; and mu&s;ic is finely qualified for every &s;ong where &s;uch emotions are expre&s;&s;ed. Mu&s;ic particularly in a chearful tone, is concordant in the highe&s;t degree with every emotion in the &s;ame tone; and hence our ta&s;te for chear|ful airs expre&s;&s;ive of mirth and jollity. Mu|&s;ic is peculiarly well qualified for accompany|ing every &s;ympathetic emotion. Sympathe|tic joy a&s;&s;ociates finely with chearful mu&s;ic, and &s;ympathetic pain not le&s;s finely with mu&s;ic that is tender and melancholy. All the different emotions of love, <HI>viz.</HI> tender|ne&s;s, concern, anxiety, pain of ab&s;ence, hope, fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accord delightfully with mu&s;ic. A per&s;on in love, even when unkindly treated, is &s;oothed by mu&s;ic. The tenderne&s;s of love &s;till prevailing, accords with a melancholy &s;train. This
<PB N="169" REF="180">
is finely exemplified by Shake&s;pear in the fourth act of <HI>Othello,</HI> where De&s;demona calls for a &s;ong expre&s;&s;ive of her di&s;tre&s;s. Wonderful is the delicacy of that writer's ta&s;te, which fails him not even in the mo&s;t refined emotions of human nature. Me|lancholy mu&s;ic again is &s;uitable to &s;light grief, which requires or admits con&s;olation. But deep grief, which refu&s;es all con&s;olation, rejects for that rea&s;on even melancholy mu|&s;ic. For a different rea&s;on, mu&s;ic is im|proper for accompanying plea&s;ant emotions of the more important kind. The&s;e totally ingro&s;s the mind, and leave no place for mu&s;ic or any &s;ort of amu&s;ement. In a pe|rilous enterpri&s;e to dethrone a tyrant, mu|&s;ic would be impertinent, even where hope prevails, and the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s is great. Alexander attacking the Indian town and mounting the wall, had certainly no impul&s;e to exert his prowe&s;s in a &s;ong. It is true, that not the lea&s;t regard is paid to the&s;e rules ei|ther in the French or Italian opera; and the attachment we have to the&s;e compo&s;i|tions, may at fir&s;t &s;ight be con&s;idered as a proof that the foregoing doctrine cannot be founded on human nature. But the gene|ral
<PB N="170" REF="181">
ta&s;te for operas is at bottom no authori|ty again&s;t me. In our operas the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o imperfectly expre&s;&s;ed, as to leave the mind free for reli&s;hing mu&s;ic of any &s;ort in|differently. It cannot be di&s;gui&s;ed, that the plea&s;ure of an opera is derived chiefly from the mu&s;ic, and &s;carce at all from the &s;entiments. A happy coincidence of emo|tions rai&s;ed by the &s;ong and by the mu&s;ic, is extremely rare; and I venture to affirm, that there is no example of it unle&s;s where the emotion rai&s;ed by the former is plea&s;ant as well as that rai&s;ed by the latter.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject we have run through, ap|pears not a little entertaining. It is ex|tremely curious to ob&s;erve, in many in&s;tan|ces, a plurality of cau&s;es producing in con|junction a great plea&s;ure: in other in&s;tances, not le&s;s frequent, no conjunction, but each cau&s;e acting in oppo&s;ition.

<P>Next in order, according to the method propo&s;ed, come external effects. And this leads to pa&s;&s;ions in particular, which invol|ving
<PB N="171" REF="182">
de&s;ire are the cau&s;es of action. Two coexi&s;tent pa&s;&s;ions that have the &s;ame ten|dency, mu&s;t be &s;imilar. They accordingly readily unite, and in conjunction have dou|ble force; which mu&s;t hold whether the two pa&s;&s;ions have the &s;ame or different cau|&s;es. This is verified by experience; from which we learn, that different pa&s;&s;ions ha|ving the &s;ame end in view, impel the mind to action with united force. The mind re|ceives not impul&s;es alternately from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, but one &s;trong impul&s;e from the whole in conjunction. And indeed it is not ea&s;y to conceive what &s;hould bar the union of pa&s;&s;ions that have all of them the &s;ame tendency.</P>
<P>Two pa&s;&s;ions having oppo&s;ite tendencies, may proceed from the &s;ame object or cau&s;e con&s;idered in different lights. Thus a mi|&s;tre&s;s may at once be the object both of love and re&s;entment. Her beauty inflames the pa&s;&s;ion of love: her cruelty or incon&s;tancy cau&s;es re&s;entment. When two &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions coexi&s;t in the &s;ame brea&s;t, the oppo&s;ition of their aim prevents any &s;ort of union. They are not felt otherwi&s;e than in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="172" REF="183">
And the con&s;equence mu&s;t be one of two things: the pa&s;&s;ions will balance each other, and prevent external action; or one of them will prevail, and accompli&s;h its end. Guari|ni, in his <HI>Pa&s;tor Fido,</HI> de&s;cribes beautifully the &s;truggle betwixt love and re&s;entment directed upon the &s;ame object.

Ovid paints in lively colours the vibration of mind betwixt two oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions directed upon the &s;ame object. Althea had two brothers much beloved, who were unju&s;tly put to death by her &s;on Meleager in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion. She was &s;trongly impelled to re|venge; but the criminal was her own &s;on. This ought to have with-held her hand. But the &s;tory makes a better figure and is more intere&s;ting, by the violence of the &s;truggle betwixt re&s;entment and maternal love.

In ca&s;es of this kind, one circum&s;tance al|ways augments the fluctuation. A re&s;olu|tion to prefer one action before another af|ter balancing betwixt them, is an inchoated gratification of the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;oftens it in &s;ome degree. This circum|&s;tance tends to give a &s;uperiority to the op|po&s;ite pa&s;&s;ion. And another circum&s;tance al&s;o concurs, that this oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ion has by re&s;traint acquired in the interim &s;ome additional force.</P>
<P>Love and jealou&s;y connected by a com|mon object, occupy the mind alternately. When the object is con&s;idered as beautiful,

love prevails: when con&s;idered as po&s;&s;ibly unfaithful, jealou&s;y prevails. A &s;ituation of this kind, affords great &s;cope for fluctua|tion of pa&s;&s;ion, which is painted to the life by &s;everal ma&s;terly hands in words as well as in colours. Shake&s;pear handles the &s;ame &s;ubject, but in a manner uncommon and peculiar to him&s;elf. In Othello's &s;oliloquy before putting his wife to death, love and jealou&s;y are repre&s;ented, each exerting its whole force, but without any &s;truggle. O|thello was naturally inflexible; and the tendere&s;t love could not divert him from a purpo&s;e he approved as right, not even for a moment. But every thing con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a character is done to reconcile the two oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions.

In Otway's <HI>Orphan,</HI> we have an illu&s;trious example of the addre&s;s employed to gratify oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions directed upon the &s;ame ob|ject. Ca&s;talio and Polydore, brothers and rivals, had &s;worn mutual confidence. Ca|&s;talio broke his faith by a private marriage. By this concealment, Polydore was unwa|rily betrayed into a di&s;mal deed, that of
<PB N="180" REF="191">
polluting his brother's bed. Thus he had injured his brother, and was injured by him. Ju&s;tice prompted him to make full atone|ment by his own death: re&s;entment again&s;t his brother required a full atonement to be made to him&s;elf. In coexi&s;tent pa&s;&s;ions &s;o contradictory, one of them commonly pre|vails after a &s;truggle. But here happily an expedient occurred to gratify both; which was, that Polydore &s;hould provoke his bro|ther to put him to death. Polydore's crime in his own opinion merited this puni&s;h|ment; and ju&s;tice was &s;atisfied when he fell by the hands of the man he had injured. He wanted at the &s;ame time to puni&s;h his brother for breach of faith; and he could not do this more effectually than by betraying his brother to be his executioner.</P>
<P>If difference of aim prevent the union of two pa&s;&s;ions though having the &s;ame object, much more will it prevent their union when their objects are al&s;o different. In both ca&s;es there is a fluctuation; but in the latter the fluctuation is &s;lower than in the former. A beautiful &s;ituation of this kind is exhibited in the <HI>Cid</HI> of Corneille.
<PB N="181" REF="192">
Don Diegue, an old &s;oldier worn out with age, having received a mortal affront from the Count father to Chimene, employs his &s;on Don Rodrigue, Chimene's lover, to demand &s;atisfaction. This &s;ituation occa|&s;ions in the brea&s;t of Don Rodrigue a cruel &s;truggle. It is a conte&s;t betwixt love and honour, one of which mu&s;t be &s;acrificed. The &s;cene is finely conducted, chiefly by making love in &s;ome degree take part with honour, Don Rodrigue reflecting, that if he lo&s;t his honour he could not de&s;erve his mi&s;tre&s;s.

<HEAD>PART V. The power of pa&s;&s;ion to adju&s;t our opinions and belief to its gratification.</HEAD>
<P>THere is &s;uch a connection among the perceptions pa&s;&s;ions and actions of the &s;ame per&s;on, that it would be wonder|ful if they &s;hould have no mutual influence. That our actions are too much directed by pa&s;&s;ion, is a &s;ad truth. It is not le&s;s cer|tain, though not &s;o commonly ob&s;erved, that pa&s;&s;ion hath an irregular influence up|on our opinions and belief. The opinions we form of men and things, are generally directed by affection. An advice given by a man of figure, hath great weight; the
<PB N="184" REF="195">
&s;ame advice from one in a low condition, is utterly neglected. A man of courage un|der-rates danger; and to the indolent, the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;tacle appears un&s;urmountable. Our opinions indeed, the re&s;ult commonly of various and often oppo&s;ite views, are &s;o &s;light and wavering, as readily to be &s;u&s;cep|tible of a bias from pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is of great u&s;e in logic; and of &s;till greater u&s;e in critici&s;m, being inti|mately connected with many principles of the fine arts that will be unfolded in the cour&s;e of this work. Being too exten&s;ive to be treated here at large, &s;ome cur&s;ory illu|&s;trations mu&s;t &s;uffice; leaving the &s;ubject to be pro&s;ecuted more particularly afterward when occa&s;ion &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>Two principles that make an eminent figure in human nature, concur to give pa&s;|&s;ion an undue influence upon our opinions and belief. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive, is a &s;trong tendency in the mind to fit ob|jects for the gratification of its pa&s;&s;ions. We are prone to &s;uch opinions of men and things as corre&s;pond to our wi&s;hes. Where the object, in dignity or importance, cor|re&s;ponds
<PB N="185" REF="196">
to the pa&s;&s;ion be&s;towed on it, the gratification is complete and there is no oc|ca&s;ion for artifice. But where the object is too mean for the pa&s;&s;ion &s;o as not to afford a complete gratification, it is wonderful how apt the mind is to impo&s;e upon it&s;elf, and how di&s;po&s;ed to proportion the object to its pa&s;&s;ion. The other principle is a &s;trong tendency in our nature to ju&s;tify our pa&s;&s;ions as well as our actions, not to others only, but even to our&s;elves. This tendency is ex|tremely remarkable with re&s;pect to di&s;agree|able pa&s;&s;ions. By its influence, objects are magnified or le&s;&s;ened, circum&s;tances &s;uppli|ed or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, every thing coloured and di&s;gui&s;ed, to an&s;wer the end of ju&s;tification. Hence the foundation of &s;elf-deceit, where a man impo&s;es upon him&s;elf innocently, and even without &s;u&s;picion of a bias.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the influence of the foregoing prin|ciples to make us form opinions contrary to truth, the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves, by &s;ubordi|nate means, contribute to the &s;ame effect. Of the&s;e means I &s;hall mention two which &s;eem to be capital. Fir&s;t, There was occa|&s;ion
<PB N="186" REF="197">

<P>The foregoing examples depend on the fir&s;t principle. In the following, both prin|ciples concur. Re&s;entment at fir&s;t is wreak|ed on the relations of the offender, in or|der
<PB N="191" REF="202">
to puni&s;h him. But as re&s;entment when &s;o outrageous is contrary to con&s;ci|ence, the mind, to ju&s;tify its pa&s;&s;ion as well as to gratify it, is di&s;po&s;ed to paint the&s;e re|lations in the blacke&s;t colours; and it ac|tually comes to be convinced, that they ought to be puni&s;hed for their own deme|rits.</P>
<P>Anger rai&s;ed by an accidental &s;troke upon a tender part, which gives great and &s;udden pain, is &s;ometimes vented upon the unde|&s;igning cau&s;e. But as the pa&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e is ab&s;urd, and as there can be no &s;olid gratification in puni&s;hing the innocent; the mind, prone to ju&s;tify as well as to gratify its pa&s;&s;ion, deludes it&s;elf in&s;tantly into a con|viction of the action's being voluntary. This conviction however is but momentary: the fir&s;t reflection &s;hows it to be erro|neous; and the pa&s;&s;ion vani&s;heth almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly with the conviction. But anger, the mo&s;t violent of all pa&s;&s;ions, has &s;till greater influence. It &s;ometimes forces the mind to per&s;onify a &s;tock or a &s;tone when it occa&s;ions bodily pain, in order to be a proper object of re&s;entment. A con|ception
<PB N="192" REF="203">
is formed of it as a voluntary agent. And that we have really a momentary con|viction of its being a voluntary agent, mu&s;t be evident from con&s;idering, that without &s;uch conviction, the pa&s;&s;ion can neither be ju&s;tified nor gratified. The imagination can give no aid. A &s;tock or a &s;tone may be imagined &s;en&s;ible; but a notion of this kind cannot be the foundation of puni&s;h|ment, &s;o long as the mind is con&s;cious that it is an imagination merely without any reality.

<PB N="197" REF="208">
hope to magnify every circum&s;tance that tends to conviction. Shake&s;pear, who &s;hows more knowledge of human nature than any of our philo&s;ophers, hath in his <HI>Cymbeline</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 2. &s;c. 6.</NOTE> repre&s;ented this bias of the mind: for he makes the per&s;on who alone was affected with the bad news, yield to evi|dence that did not convince any of his com|panions.

<P>If the news intere&s;t us in &s;o low a de|gree as to give place to rea&s;on, the effect will not be quite the &s;ame. Judging of the probability or improbability of the &s;tory, the mind &s;ettles in a rational conviction ei|ther that it is true or not. But even in this ca&s;e, it is ob&s;ervable, that the mind is not allowed to re&s;t in that degree of con|viction which is produced by rational evi|dence. If the news be in any degree fa|vourable, our belief is augmented by hope beyond its true pitch; and if unfavourable, by fear.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="209">
The ob&s;ervation holds equally with re|&s;pect to future events. If a future event be either much wi&s;hed or dreaded, the mind, to gratify its pa&s;&s;ion, never fails to augment the probability beyond truth.</P>
<P>The credit which in all ages has been given to wonders and prodigies, even the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous, is a &s;trange phenomenon. Nothing can be more evi|dent than the following propo&s;ition, That the more &s;ingular any event is, the more evidence is required. A familiar event daily occurring, being in it&s;elf extremely pro|bable, finds ready credit, and therefore is vouched by the &s;lighte&s;t evidence. But a &s;trange and rare event, contrary to the cour&s;e of nature, ought not to be ea&s;ily be|lieved. It &s;tarts up without connection, and without cau&s;e, &s;o far as we can di&s;cover; and to overcome the improbability of &s;uch an event, the very &s;tronge&s;t evidence is re|quired. It is certain, however, that won|ders and prodigies are &s;wallowed by the vulgar, upon evidence that would not be &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the mo&s;t familiar oc|currence. It has been reckoned difficult to
<PB N="199" REF="210">
explain this irregular bias of the mind. We are now no longer at a lo&s;s about its cau&s;e. The pronene&s;s we have to gratify our pa&s;&s;ions, which di&s;plays it&s;elf upon &s;o many occa&s;ions, produces this irrational be|lief. A &s;tory of gho&s;ts or fairies, told with an air of gravity and truth, rai&s;eth an emotion of wonder, and perhaps of dread.

<P>Opinion and belief are influenced by propen&s;ity as well as by pa&s;&s;ion; for the mind is di&s;po&s;ed to gratify both.

<HEAD>APPENDIX to Part V. Concerning the methods which nature hath afforded for computing time and &s;pace.</HEAD>
<P>I Introduce here the &s;ubject propo&s;ed, be|cau&s;e it affords &s;everal curious examples of the power of pa&s;&s;ion to adju&s;t objects to its gratification; a le&s;&s;on that cannot be too much inculcated, as there is not perhaps another bias in human nature that hath an influence &s;o univer&s;al, and that is &s;o apt to make us wander from truth as well as from ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I begin with time; and the que&s;tion &s;hortly is, What was the mea&s;ure of time before artificial mea&s;ures were invented?
<PB N="201" REF="212">
and, What is the mea&s;ure at pre&s;ent when the&s;e are not at hand? I &s;peak not of months and days, which we compute by the moon and &s;un; but of hours, or in general of the time that runs betwixt any two occurrences when there is not acce&s;s to the &s;un. The only natural mea&s;ure we have, is the train of our thoughts; and we always judge the time to be long or &s;hort, in proportion to the number of perceptions that have pa&s;&s;ed through the mind during that interval. This is indeed a very imperfect mea&s;ure; becau&s;e in the different conditions of a quick or &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the computation is different. But however imperfect, it is the only mea&s;ure by which a per&s;on natu|rally calculates time; and this mea&s;ure is applied on all occa&s;ions, without regard to any occa&s;ional variation in the rate of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This natural mea&s;ure of time, imperfect as it is, would however be tolerable, did it labour under no other imperfection than the ordinary variations that happen in the motion of our perceptions. But in many particular circum&s;tances, it is much more fallacious;
<PB N="202" REF="213">
and in order to explain the&s;e di&s;tinctly, I mu&s;t analize the &s;ubject. Time is generally computed at two different periods; one while time is pa&s;&s;ing, another after it is pa&s;t. I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e &s;eparately, with the errors to which each of them is liable. It will be found that the&s;e errors often produce very different computations of the &s;ame period of time. The computation of time while it is pa&s;&s;ing, comes fir&s;t in order. It is a com|mon and trite ob&s;ervation, That to lovers ab|&s;ence appears immea&s;urably long, every mi|nute an hour, and every hour a day. The &s;ame computation is made in every ca&s;e where we long for a di&s;tant event; as where one is in expectation of good news, or where a profligate heir watches for the death of an old man who keeps him from a great e&s;tate. Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e are in&s;tances not fewer in number. To a criminal the interval betwixt &s;entence and execution appears mi&s;erably &s;hort; and the &s;ame holds in every ca&s;e where one dreads an approaching event. Of this even a &s;choolboy can bear witne&s;s: the hour allowed him for play, moves, in his apprehen&s;ion, with a very &s;wift pace: be|fore
<PB N="203" REF="214">
he is thoroughly engaged, the hour is gone. A reckoning founded on the num|ber of ideas, will never produce computa|tions &s;o regularly oppo&s;ite to each other; for a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas is not connected with our wi&s;hes, nor a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with our fears. What is it then, that, in the ca&s;es mentioned, moves nature to de&s;ert her common mea&s;ure for one very different? I know not that this que&s;tion ever has been re&s;olved. The fal&s;e reckonings I have &s;ug|ge&s;ted are &s;o common and familiar, that no writer has thought of inquiring for their cau&s;e. And indeed, to enter upon this mat|ter at &s;hort hand, without preparation, might occa&s;ion &s;ome difficulty. But to en|counter the difficulty, we luckily are prepa|red by what is &s;aid above about the power of pa&s;&s;ion to fit objects for its gratification. Among the other circum&s;tances that terrify a condemned criminal, the &s;hort time he has to live is one. Terror, like our other pa&s;&s;ions, prone to its gratification, adju&s;ts every one of the&s;e circum&s;tances to its own tone. It magnifies in particular the &s;hort|ne&s;s of the interval betwixt the pre&s;ent time
<PB N="204" REF="215">
and that of the execution; and forces upon the criminal a conviction that the hour of his death approaches with a &s;wift pace. In the &s;ame manner, among the other di&s;tre&s;&s;es of an ab&s;ent lover, the time of &s;eparation is a capital circum&s;tance, which for that rea&s;on is greatly magnified by his anxiety and im|patience. He imagines that the time of meeting comes on very &s;low, or rather that it will never come. Every minute is thought of an intolerable length. Here is a fair and I hope &s;atisfactory account, why we reckon time to be tedious when we long for a future event, and not le&s;s fleet when we dread the event. This account is confirmed by other in&s;tances. Bodily pain fixt to one part, produceth a &s;low train of perceptions, which, according to the common mea&s;ure of time, ought to make it appear &s;hort. Yet we know, that in &s;uch a &s;tate time has the op|po&s;ite appearance. Bodily pain is always attended with a degree of impatience and an anxiety to be rid of it, which make us judge every minute to be an hour.

a pain is not attended with the &s;ame degree of impatience.

<P>How ought it to &s;tand with a man who apprehends bad news?

Yet the computation here is di|rectly oppo&s;ite. Reflecting upon this diffi|culty, there appears one capital circum|&s;tance in which the two ca&s;es differ. The fate of the criminal is determined: in the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, the man is &s;till in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Every one knows how di|&s;tre&s;sful &s;u&s;pen&s;e is to the bulk of man|kind.

<P>Reflecting upon the natural method of computing pre&s;ent time, it &s;hows how far from truth we may be led by the irregular power of pa&s;&s;ion. Nor are our eyes imme|diately opened when the &s;cene is pa&s;t: the deception continues while there remain any traces of the pa&s;&s;ion. But looking back upon pa&s;t time when the joy or di&s;tre&s;s is no
<PB N="208" REF="219">
longer remembered, the computation we make is very different. In this &s;ituation, pa&s;&s;ion being out of the que&s;tion, we apply the ordinary mea&s;ure, <HI>viz.</HI> the cour&s;e of our perceptions; and I &s;hall now proceed to the errors that this mea&s;ure is &s;ubjected to. In order to have an accurate notion of this matter, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a train of perceptions, and a train of ideas. Real objects make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, and are faithfully remembered. Ideas, on the con|trary, however entertaining at the time, are apt to e&s;cape an after recollection. Hence it is, that in retro&s;pection, the time that was employed upon real objects, appears longer than the time that was employed up|on ideas. The former are more accurately recollected than the latter; and we mea&s;ure the time by the number that is recollected. I proceed to particulars. After fini&s;hing a journey through a populous country, the frequency of agreeable objects di&s;tinctly re|collected by the traveller, makes the time &s;pent in the journey appear to him longer than it was in reality. This is chiefly re|markable in a fir&s;t journey, where every
<PB N="209" REF="220">
object is new and makes a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion. On the other hand, after fini&s;hing a journey through a barren country thinly peopled, the time appears &s;hort, being mea|&s;ured by the number of objects, which were few and far from intere&s;ting. Here in both in&s;tances a reckoning is brought out, di|rectly oppo&s;ite to that made during the jour|ney. And this, by the way, &s;erves to ac|count for a thing which may appear &s;ingu|lar, that in a barren country the computed miles are always longer, than near the capi|tal, where the country is rich and populous. The traveller has no natural mea&s;ure of the &s;pace gone through, other than the time be&s;towed upon it; nor any natural mea&s;ure of the time, other than the number of his per|ceptions. The&s;e being proportioned to the number of vi&s;ible objects, he imagines that he hath con&s;umed more time on his day's journey, and accompli&s;hed a greater number of miles, in a populous than in a wa&s;te country. By this method of calculation, e|very computed mile in the former mu&s;t in reality be &s;horter than in the latter.</P>
<P>Again, the travelling with an agreeable
<PB N="210" REF="221">
companion produceth a &s;hort computation both of the road and of time; e&s;pecially if there be few objects that demand attention, or if the objects be familiar. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame of young people at a ball, or of a joyous company over a bottle. The ideas with which they have been entertained, be|ing tran&s;itory, e&s;cape the memory. After all is over, they reflect that they have been much diverted, but &s;carce can &s;ay about what.</P>
<P>When one is totally occupied in any a|greeable work that admits not many ob|jects, time runs on without ob&s;ervation; and upon an after recollection mu&s;t appear &s;hort, in proportion to the paucity of ob|jects. This is &s;till more remarkable in clo&s;e contemplation and in deep thinking, where the train, compo&s;ed wholly of ideas, pro|ceeds with an extreme &s;low pace. Not on|ly are the ideas few in number, but are apt to e&s;cape an after-reckoning. The like fal&s;e reckoning of time may proceed from an op|po&s;ite &s;tate of mind. In a reverie, where ideas float at random without making any im|pre&s;&s;ion, time goes on unheeded and the
<PB N="211" REF="222">
reckoning is lo&s;t. A reverie may be &s;o pro|found as to prevent the recollection of any one idea: that the mind was bu&s;ied in a train of thinking, will in general be re|membered; but what was the &s;ubject, has quite e&s;caped the memory. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, we are altogether at a lo&s;s about the time: we have no <HI>data</HI> for making a computation. No cau&s;e produceth &s;o fal&s;e a reckoning of time, as immoderate grief. The mind, in this &s;tate, is violently attached to a &s;ingle object, and admits not a different thought. Any other object breaking in, is in&s;tantly bani&s;hed, &s;o as &s;carce to give an appearance of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In a reverie, we are uncer|tain of the time that is pa&s;t: but in the ex|ample now given, there is an appearance of certainty, &s;o far as the natural mea&s;ure of time can be tru&s;ted, that the time mu&s;t have been &s;hort, when the perceptions are &s;o few in number.</P>
<P>The natural mea&s;ure of &s;pace appears more ob&s;cure than that of time. I venture however to enter upon it, leaving it to be further pro&s;ecuted, if it be thought of a|ny importance.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="223">
The &s;pace marked out for a hou&s;e, ap|pears con&s;iderably larger after it is divided into its proper parts. A piece of ground ap|pears larger after it is &s;urrounded with a fence; and &s;till larger when it is made a garden and divided into different copart|ments.</P>
<P>On the contrary, a large plain looks le&s;s after it is divided into parts. The &s;ea mu&s;t be excepted, which looks le&s;s from that very circum&s;tance of not being divided into parts.</P>
<P>A room of a moderate &s;ize appears larger when properly furni&s;hed. But when a very large room is furni&s;hed, I doubt whether it be not le&s;&s;ened in appearance.</P>
<P>A room of a moderate &s;ize, looks le&s;s by having a ceiling lower than in proportion. The &s;ame low ceiling makes a very large room look larger than it is in reality.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments are by far too &s;mall a &s;tock for a general theory. But they are all that occur at pre&s;ent; and without attempt|ing any regular &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hall &s;atisfy my&s;elf with a few conjectures.</P>
<P>The large&s;t angle of vi&s;ion &s;eems to me
<PB N="213" REF="224">
the natural mea&s;ure of &s;pace. The eye is the only judge; and in examining with it the &s;ize of any plain, or the length of any line, the mo&s;t accurate method that can be taken is, to run over the object in parts. The large&s;t part that can be taken in at one &s;tedfa&s;t look, determines the large&s;t angle of vi&s;ion; and when that angle is given, one may in&s;titute a calculation by trying with the eye how many of the&s;e parts are in the whole.</P>
<P>Whether this angle be the &s;ame in all men, I know not. The &s;malle&s;t angle of vi&s;ion is a&s;certained; and to a&s;certain the large&s;t angle, would not be le&s;s curious.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it known, it would be a ve|ry imperfect mea&s;ure; perhaps more &s;o than the natural mea&s;ure of time. It requires great &s;teadine&s;s of eye to mea&s;ure a line with any accuracy, by applying to it the large&s;t angle of di&s;tinctvi&s;ion. And &s;uppo&s;e this &s;tea|dine&s;s to be acquired by practice, the mea&s;ure will be imperfect from other circum&s;tances. The &s;pace comprehended under this angle, will be different according to the di&s;tance, and al&s;o according to the &s;ituation of the ob|ject.
<PB N="214" REF="225">
Of a perpendicular this angle will comprehend the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace. The &s;pace will be larger in looking upon an inclined plain; and will be larger or le&s;s in propor|tion to the degree of inclination.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure of &s;pace, like the mea&s;ure of time, is liable to &s;ome extraordinary errors from certain operations of the mind, which will account for &s;ome of the erroneous judge|ments above mentioned. The &s;pace mark|ed out for a dwelling-hou&s;e, where the eye is at any rea&s;onable di&s;tance, is &s;eldom great|er than can be &s;een at once without moving the head. Divide this &s;pace into two or three equal parts, and none of the&s;e parts will ap|pear much le&s;s than what can be compre|hended at one di&s;tinct look; con&s;equently each of them will appear equal, or nearly e|qual, to what the whole did before the di|vi&s;ion. If, on the other hand, the whole be very &s;mall, &s;o as &s;carce to fill the eye at one look, its divi&s;ions into parts will, I con|jecture, make it appear &s;till le&s;s. The mi|nutene&s;s of the parts is, by an ea&s;y tran&s;i|tion of ideas, transferred to the whole. Each part hath a diminutive appearance, and by
<PB N="215" REF="226">
the intimate connection of the&s;e parts with the whole, we pa&s;s the &s;ame judgement up|on all.</P>
<P>The &s;pace marked out for a &s;mall garden, is &s;urveyed almo&s;t at one view; and re|quires a motion of the eye &s;o &s;light, as to pa&s;s for an object that can be comprehend|ed under the large&s;t angle of di&s;tinct vi&s;ion. If not divided into too many parts, we are apt to form the &s;ame judgement of each part; and con&s;equently to magnify the gar|den in proportion to the number of its parts.</P>
<P>A very large plain without protuberances, is an object not le&s;s rare than beautiful; and in tho&s;e who &s;ee it for the fir&s;t time, it mu&s;t produce an emotion of wonder. This emo|tion, however &s;light, tending to its own gratification, impo&s;es upon the mind, and makes it judge that the plain is larger than it is in reality. Divide this plain into parts, and our wonder cea&s;es. It is no longer con&s;idered as one great plain, but as &s;o ma|ny different fields or inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time one beholds the &s;ea, it ap|pears to be large beyond all bounds. When
<PB N="216" REF="227">
it becomes familiar, and rai&s;es our wonder in no degree, it appears le&s;s than it is in reality. In a &s;torm it appears larger, being di&s;tingui&s;hable by the rolling waves into a number of great parts. I&s;lands &s;cattered at con&s;iderable di&s;tances, add in appearance to its &s;ize. Each intercepted part looks ex|tremely large, and we &s;ilently apply arith|metic to increa&s;e the appearance of the whole. Many i&s;lands &s;cattered at hand, give a diminutive appearance to the &s;ea, by its connection with its diminutive parts. The Lomond lake would undoubtedly look larger without its i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Furniture increa&s;eth in appearance the &s;ize of a &s;mall room, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that divi&s;ions increa&s;e in appearance the &s;ize of a garden. The emotion of wonder which is rai&s;ed by a very large room with|out furniture, makes it look larger than it is in reality. If completely furni&s;hed, we view it in parts, and our wonder is not rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>A low ceiling hath a diminutive appear|ance, which, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition of ideas, is communicated to the length and breadth, provided they bear any &s;ort of proportion to
<PB N="217" REF="228">
the height. If they be out of all propor|tion, the oppo&s;ition &s;eizes the mind, and rai&s;es &s;ome degree of wonder, which makes the difference appear greater than it real|ly is.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART VI. Of the re&s;emblance emotions bear to their cau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THat many emotions bear a certain re|&s;emblance to their cau&s;es, is a truth that can be made clear by induction; though, &s;o far as I know, the ob&s;ervation has not been made by any writer. Motion, in its different circum&s;tances, is productive of feelings that re&s;emble it. Sluggi&s;h motion, for example, cau&s;eth a languid unplea&s;ant feeling; &s;low uniform motion, a feeling calm and plea&s;ant; and bri&s;k motion, a lively feeling that rou&s;es the &s;pirits and pro|motes activity. A fall of water through rocks, rai&s;es in the mind a tumultuous con|fu&s;ed agitation, extremely &s;imilar to its
<PB N="218" REF="229">
cau&s;e. When force is exerted with any ef|fort, the &s;pectator feels a &s;imilar effort as of force exerted within his mind. A large object &s;wells the heart. An elevated object makes the &s;pectator &s;tand erect.</P>
<P>Sounds al&s;o produce emotions that re|&s;emble them. A &s;ound in a low key, brings down the mind. Such a &s;ound in a full tone, hath a certain &s;olemnity, which it commu|nicates to the emotion produced by it. A &s;ound in a high key, chears the mind by rai&s;ing it. Such a &s;ound in a full tone, both elevates and &s;wells the mind.</P>
<P>Again, a wall or pillar that declines from the perpendicular, produceth a painful emo|tion, as of a tottering and falling within the mind. An emotion &s;omewhat &s;imilar is produced by a tall pillar that &s;tands &s;o tick|li&s;h as to look like falling. For this rea&s;on, a column upon a ba&s;e looks better than up|on the naked ground. The ba&s;e, which makes a part of the column, in&s;pires a feel|ing of firmne&s;s and &s;tability. The ground &s;upporting a naked column, is too large to be con&s;idered as its ba&s;e. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, a cube as a ba&s;e, is preferred before
<PB N="219" REF="230">
a cylinder, though the latter is a more beau|tiful figure. The angles of a cube, being extended to a greater di&s;tance from the cen|tre than the circumference of a cylinder, give the column a greater appearance of &s;ta|bility. This excludes not a different rea|&s;on, that the ba&s;e, &s;haft, and capital, of a pillar, ought, for the &s;ake of variety, to dif|fer from each other. If the &s;haft be round, the ba&s;e and capital ought to be &s;quare.</P>
<P>A con&s;trained po&s;ture, unea&s;y to the man him&s;elf, is di&s;agreeable to the &s;pectator; which makes it a rule in painting, that the drapery ought not to adhere to the body, but hang loo&s;e, that the figures may appear ea&s;y and free in their movements. Hence the di&s;agreeable figure of a French dancing-ma&s;ter is one of Hogarth's pieces. It is al&s;o ridiculous, becau&s;e the con&s;traint is a&s;&s;umed and not forced.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervation is not confined to emotions rai&s;ed by &s;till life. It holds al&s;o in tho&s;e which are rai&s;ed by the qualities, actions, and pa&s;&s;ions, of a &s;en&s;ible being. Love in&s;pired by a fine woman, a&s;&s;umes her qualities. It is &s;ublime, &s;oft, ten|der,
<PB N="220" REF="231">
&s;evere, or gay, according to its cau&s;e. This is &s;till more remarkable in emotions rai&s;ed by human actions. It hath already been remarked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. of this chapter, &s;ect. 3.</NOTE>, that any &s;ignal in&s;tance of gratitude, be&s;ide procuring e&s;teem for the author, rai&s;eth in the &s;pectator a vague emotion of gratitude, which di&s;po&s;eth him to be grateful. I now further remark, that this vague emotion, being of the &s;ame kind with what produced the grateful action, hath a &s;trong re&s;emblance to its cau&s;e. Courage exerted in&s;pires the reader as well as the &s;pectator with a like emotion of cou|rage. A ju&s;t action fortifies our love to ju&s;tice, and a generous action rou&s;es our genero&s;ity. In &s;hort, with re&s;pect to all vir|tuous actions, it will be found by induction, that they lead us to imitation by in&s;piring emotions re&s;embling the pa&s;&s;ions that pro|duced the&s;e actions. And hence the be|nefit of dealing in choice books and in choice company.</P>
<P>Grief as well as joy are infectious: the emotions they rai&s;e in a &s;pectator re&s;emble
<PB N="221" REF="232">
them perfectly. Fear is equally infectious: and hence in an army, fear, even from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;e, making an impre&s;&s;ion on a few, &s;preads generally through all, and be|comes an univer&s;al panic. Pity is &s;imilar to its cau&s;e. A parting &s;cene betwixt lovers or friends, produceth in the &s;pectator a &s;ort of pity, which is tender like the di&s;tre&s;s. The angui&s;h of remor&s;e, produceth pity of a har&s;h kind; and if the remor&s;e be ex|treme, the pity hath a mixture of horror. Anger I think is &s;ingular; for even where it is moderate and cau&s;eth no di&s;gu&s;t, it di&s;po&s;es not the &s;pectator to anger in any degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, poet. cap. 18. &sect;3. &s;ays, that anger rai&s;eth in the &s;pectator a &s;imilar emotion of anger.</NOTE>. Covetou&s;ne&s;s, cruelty, treachery, and other vicious pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o far from rai&s;ing any emotion &s;imilar to them&s;elves, to incite a &s;pectator to imitation, that they have an oppo&s;ite effect. They rai&s;e abhor|rence, and fortify the &s;pectator in his aver|&s;ion to &s;uch actions. When anger is im|moderate, it cannot fail to produce the &s;ame effect.</P>

<HEAD>PART VII. Final cau&s;es of the more frequent emotions and pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a law in our nature, that we never act but by the impul&s;e of de&s;ire; which in other words is &s;aying, that it is pa&s;&s;ion, by the de&s;ire included in it, which deter|mines the will. Hence in the conduct of life, it is of the utmo&s;t importance, that our pa&s;&s;ions be directed upon proper ob|jects, tend to ju&s;t and rational ends, and with relation to each other be duly balan|ced. The beauty of contrivance, &s;o con&s;picuous in the human frame, is not confined to the rational part of our nature, but is vi&s;ible over the whole. Concerning the pa&s;&s;ions in particular, however irregular, head&s;trong, and perver&s;e, in an overly view, they may appear, I propo&s;e to &s;how, that they are by nature adju&s;ted and tem|pered with admirable wi&s;dom, for the good of &s;ociety as well as for private good.
<PB N="223" REF="234">
This &s;ubject is exten&s;ive: but as the nature of the pre&s;ent undertaking will not admit a complete di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it &s;hall &s;uffice to give a few ob&s;ervations in general upon the &s;en|&s;itive part of our nature, without regarding that &s;trange irregularity of pa&s;&s;ion di&s;cover|ed in &s;ome individuals. Such topical irre|gularities, if I may u&s;e the term, cannot fairly be held an objection to the pre&s;ent theory. We are frequently, it is true, mi&s;led by inordinate pa&s;&s;ion: but we are al&s;o, and perhaps not le&s;s frequently, mi&s;led by wrong judgement.</P>
<P>In order to a di&s;tinct apprehen&s;ion of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, that an agreeable object produceth always a plea&s;ant emotion, and a di&s;agreeable object one that is painful. This is a general law of nature, which admits not a &s;ingle excep|tion. Agreeablene&s;s in the object or cau&s;e is indeed &s;o e&s;&s;entially connected with plea&s;ure in the emotion its effect, that an agreeable object cannot be better defined, than by its power of producing a plea&s;ant emotion. Di&s;agreeablene&s;s in the object or cau&s;e, has
<PB N="224" REF="235">
the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ary connection with pain in the emotion produced by it.</P>
<P>From this preliminary it appears, that to inquire for what end an emotion is made plea&s;ant or painful, re&s;olves into an inquiry for what end its cau&s;e is made agreeable or di&s;agreeable. And from the mo&s;t accurate induction it will be di&s;covered, that no cau&s;e of an emotion is made agreeable or di&s;agree|able arbitrarily; but that the&s;e qualities are &s;o di&s;tributed as to an&s;wer wi&s;e and good pur|po&s;es. It is an invincible proof of the be|nignity of the Deity, that we are &s;urround|ed with things generally agreeable, which contribute remarkably to our entertainment and to our happine&s;s. Some things are made di&s;agreeable, &s;uch as a rotten carca&s;s, becau&s;e they are noxious. Others, a dirty mar&s;h, for example, or a barren heath, are made di&s;agreeable in order to excite our indu&s;try. And with re&s;pect to the few things that are neither agreeable nor di&s;|agreeable; it will be made evident, that their being left indifferent is not a work of chance but of wi&s;dom. Of &s;uch I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to give &s;everal in&s;tances.</P>

Having attempted to a&s;&s;ign the final cau|&s;es of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions con&s;idered as plea&s;ant or painful, we proceed to the final cau&s;es of the de&s;ires involved in them.

One pa&s;&s;ion moves us to cling to its object, one to fly from it; one pa&s;&s;ion impels to action for our own good, and one for the good of others; one pa&s;&s;ion prompts us to do good to our&s;elves or o|thers, and one to do mi&s;chief, frequently to others, and &s;ometimes even to our|&s;elves. Deliberating upon this intricate &s;ubject, and finding an intimate corre|&s;pondence betwixt our de&s;ires and their objects, it is natural to think that the former mu&s;t be regulated in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the latter. In this view, I begin with de&s;ire directed upon an inanimate object.</P>
<P>Any plea&s;ure we have in an agreeable object of this kind, is enjoyed by the continu|ance of the plea&s;ant impre&s;&s;ion it makes up|on us; and accordingly the de&s;ire involved in
<PB N="226" REF="237">
the plea&s;ant emotion tends to that end, and is gratified by dwelling upon the agreeable object. Hence &s;uch an object may be pro|perly termed <HI>attractive.</HI> Thus a flowing river, a towering hill, a fine garden, are attractive objects. They fix the attention of the &s;pectator, by in&s;piring plea&s;ant e|motions, which are gratified by adhering to the&s;e objects and enjoying them. On the other hand, a di&s;agreeable object of the &s;ame kind, rai&s;es in us a painful emotion including a de&s;ire to turn from the object, which relieves us of cour&s;e from the pain; and hence &s;uch an object may be properly termed <HI>repul&s;ive.</HI> A mon&s;trous birth, for example, a rotten carca&s;s, a confu&s;ion of jarring &s;ounds, are repul&s;ive. They repel the mind, by in&s;piring painful or unplea&s;ant emotions, which are gratified by flying from &s;uch objects. Thus in general, with regard to inanimate objects, the de&s;ire in|cluded in every plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;ion tends to prolong the plea&s;ure, and the de&s;ire inclu|ded in every painful pa&s;&s;ion tends to put an end to the pain. Here the final cau&s;e is evident. Our de&s;ires, &s;o far, are modelled
<PB N="227" REF="238">
in &s;uch a manner as to corre&s;pond preci&s;ely to the &s;en&s;itive part of our nature, prone to happine&s;s and aver&s;e to mi&s;ery. The&s;e operations of adhering to an agreeable ina|nimate object, and flying from one that is di&s;agreeable, are performed in the begin|ning of life by means of de&s;ire impelling us, without the intervention of rea&s;on or reflec|tion. Rea&s;on and reflection directing &s;elf-love, become afterward motives that unite their force with de&s;ire; becau&s;e experience informs us, that the adhering to agree|able objects and the flying from tho&s;e that are di&s;agreeable, contribute to our happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible Beings con&s;idered as objects of pa&s;&s;ion, lead us into a more complex theo|ry. A &s;en&s;ible being that is agreeable by its attributes, in&s;pires us with a plea&s;ant emo|tion; and the de&s;ire included in this emotion has evidently different means of gratification. A man regarding him&s;elf only, may be &s;ati&s;|fied with viewing and contemplating this be|ing, preci&s;ely as if it were inanimate; or he may de&s;ire the more generous gratification of making it happy. Were man altogether
<PB N="228" REF="239">
&s;elfi&s;h, it would be conformable to his na|ture, that he &s;hould indulge the plea&s;ant emotion without making any acknowledge|ment to the per&s;on who gives him plea&s;ure, more than to a pure air or temperate clime when he enjoys the&s;e benefits. But as man is endued with a principle of benevolence as well as of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, he is prompted by his nature to de&s;ire the good of every &s;en|&s;ible being that gives him plea&s;ure. And the final cau&s;e of de&s;ire &s;o directed, is illu|&s;trious. It contributes to a man's own hap|pine&s;s, by affording him more means of gratification than he can have when his de|&s;ire terminates upon him&s;elf alone; and at the &s;ame time it tends eminently to im|prove the happine&s;s of tho&s;e with whom he is connected. The directing our de&s;ires in this manner, occa&s;ions a beautiful coa|lition of &s;elf-love with benevolence; for both are equally promoted by the &s;ame in|ternal impul&s;e, and by the &s;ame external conduct. And this con&s;ideration, by the way, ought to &s;ilence tho&s;e minute philo|&s;ophers, who, ignorant of human nature, teach a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful doctrine, That to
<PB N="229" REF="240">
&s;erve others unle&s;s with a view to our own good, is weakne&s;s and folly; as if &s;elf-love only contributed to happine&s;s and not be|nevolence. The hand of God is too vi&s;ible in the human frame, to permit us to think &s;eriou&s;ly, that there ever can be any jarring or incon&s;i&s;tency among natural principles, tho&s;e e&s;pecially of &s;elf-love and benevo|lence, which regulate the bulk of our ac|tions.</P>
<P>Next in order come &s;en&s;ible Beings that are in affliction or pain. It is di&s;agreeable to behold a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s; and therefore this object mu&s;t rai&s;e in the &s;pectator an unea&s;y emotion. Were man purely a &s;el|fi&s;h being, he would be prompted by his nature to turn from every object, animate or inanimate, that gives him unea&s;ine&s;s. But the principle of benevolence gives an oppo|&s;ite direction to his de&s;ire. It impels him to afford relief; and by relieving the per|&s;on from di&s;tre&s;s, his de&s;ire is fully grati|fied. Our benevolence to a per&s;on in di|&s;tre&s;s is inflamed into an emotion of &s;ympa|thy, &s;ignifying in Greek the painful emo|tion that is rai&s;ed in us by that per&s;on.
<PB N="230" REF="241">
Thus &s;ympathy, though a painful emotion, is in its nature attractive. And with re|&s;pect to its final cau&s;e, we can be at no lo&s;s. It not only tends to relieve a fellow-creature from pain, but in its gratification is greatly more plea&s;ant than if it were re|pul&s;ive.</P>
<P>We in the la&s;t place bring under con&s;ide|ration per&s;ons hateful by vice or wickedne&s;s. Imagine a wretch who has lately perpetra|ted &s;ome horrid crime. he is di&s;agreeable to every &s;pectator; and con&s;equently rai&s;es in every &s;pectator a painful emotion. What is the natural gratification of the de|&s;ire that accompanies this painful emotion? I mu&s;t here again ob&s;erve, that &s;uppo&s;ing man to be entirely a &s;elfi&s;h being, he would be prompted by his nature to relieve him|&s;elf from the pain by averting his eye, and bani&s;hing the criminal from his thoughts. But man is not &s;o con&s;tituted. He is com|po&s;ed of many principles, which, though &s;eemingly contradictory, are perfectly con|cordant. The principle of benevolence in|fluences his conduct, not le&s;s remarkably than that of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. And in order to
<PB N="231" REF="242">
an&s;wer the foregoing que&s;tion, I mu&s;t in|troduce a third principle, not le&s;s remark|able in its influence than either of tho&s;e mentioned. It is that principle common to all, which prompts us to puni&s;h tho&s;e who do wrong. An envious, malicious, or cruel action, is di&s;agreeable to me even where I have no connection with the &s;uf|ferer, and rai&s;es in me the painful emotion of re&s;entment. The gratification of this emotion, when accompanied with de&s;ire, is directed by the principle now unfolded. Being prompted by my nature to puni&s;h guilt as well as to reward virtue, my de&s;ire is not gratified but by inflicting puni&s;hment. I mu&s;t cha&s;ti&s;e the wretch by indignation at lea&s;t and hatred, if not more &s;everely. Here the final cau&s;e is &s;elf-evident.</P>
<P>An injury done to my&s;elf, touching me more than when done to others, rai&s;es my re&s;entment in a higher degree. The de&s;ire accordingly included in this pa&s;&s;ion, is not &s;atisfied with &s;o &s;light a puni&s;hment as in|dignation or hatred. It is not fully gratified without retaliation; and the author mu&s;t by my hand &s;uffer mi&s;chief, as great at lea&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="243">
as he has done me. Neither can we be at any lo&s;s about the final cau&s;e of this higher degree of re&s;entment. The whole vigor of this pa&s;&s;ion is required to &s;ecure individuals from the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A wicked or di&s;graceful action, is di&s;|agreeable not only to others, but even to the delinquent him&s;elf. It rai&s;es in him as well as in others a painful emotion including a de&s;ire of puni&s;hment. The painful emo|tion which the delinquent feels, is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>remor&s;e</HI>; and in this ca&s;e the de&s;ire he has to puni&s;h is directed again&s;t him&s;elf. There cannot be imagined a better contrivance to deter us from vice; for remor&s;e is the &s;evere&s;t of all puni&s;hments. This pa&s;&s;ion and the de&s;ire of &s;elf-puni&s;h|ment derived from it, are touched delicately by Terence.

<P>The ca&s;es mentioned are, where benevo|lence alone or where de&s;ire of puni&s;hment alone, governs without a rival. And it was nece&s;&s;ary to handle the&s;e ca&s;es &s;eparately, in order to elucidate a &s;ubject which by writers is left in great ob&s;curity. But neither of the&s;e principles operates always without rival&s;hip. Ca&s;es may be figured, and ca&s;es actually exi&s;t, where the &s;ame per&s;on is an object both of &s;ympathy and of de&s;ire to puni&s;h. Thus the &s;ight of a profligate in the vene|real di&s;ea&s;e, over-run with botches and fores, actuates both principles. While his di&s;tre&s;s fixes my attention, &s;ympathy exerts
<PB N="235" REF="246">
it&s;elf; but &s;o &s;oon as I think of his profliga|cy, hatred prevails, and a de&s;ire to puni&s;h. This in general is the ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s occa|&s;ioned by immoral actions that are not high|ly criminal. And if the di&s;tre&s;s and the im|moral action be in any proportion, &s;ympathy and hatred counterbalancing each other will not &s;uffer me either to afford relief or to in|flict puni&s;hment. What then will be the re&s;ult of the whole? The principle of &s;elf-love &s;olves the que&s;tion. Abhorring an ob|ject &s;o loath&s;ome, I naturally avert my eye, and walk off as fa&s;t as I can, in order to be relieved from the pain.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ubject gives birth to &s;everal other ob&s;ervations, for which I could not find room above, without relaxing more from the &s;trictne&s;s of order and connection, than with &s;afety could be indulged in di&s;|cour&s;ing upon a matter that with difficulty is made per&s;picuous, even with all the ad|vantages of order and connection. The&s;e ob&s;ervations I &s;hall throw out loo&s;ely as they occur, without giving my&s;elf any further trouble about method.</P>
<P>No action good or bad is altogether indif|ferent
<PB N="236" REF="247">
even to a mere &s;pectator. If good, it in&s;pires e&s;teem; and indignation, if wicked. But it is remarkable, that the&s;e emotions &s;el|dom are accompanied with de&s;ire. The abi|lities of man are limited, and he finds &s;uffi|cient employment, in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, in requiting his benefactors, and in pu|ni&s;hing tho&s;e who wrong him, without mo|ving out of his own &s;phere for the benefit or cha&s;ti&s;ement of tho&s;e with whom he has no connection.</P>
<P>If the good qualities of others excite my benevolence, the &s;ame qualities in my&s;elf mu&s;t produce a &s;imilar effect in a &s;uperior degree, upon account of the natural partia|lity every man hath for him&s;elf. This in|crea&s;es &s;elf-love. If the&s;e qualities be of a high rank, they produce a feeling of &s;upe|riority, which naturally leads me to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome &s;ort of government over others. Mean qualities, on the other hand, produce in me a feeling of inferiority, which naturally leads me to &s;ubmit to others. Unle&s;s &s;uch feel|ings were di&s;tributed among individuals in &s;ociety by mea&s;ure and proportion, there could be no natural &s;ubordination of &s;ome
<PB N="237" REF="248">
to others, which is the principal foundation of government.</P>
<P>No other branch of the human con&s;titu|tion &s;hows more vi&s;ibly our de&s;tination for &s;ociety, nor tends more to our improvement, than appetite for fame or e&s;teem. The whole conveniencies of life being derived from mutual aid and &s;upport in &s;ociety, it ought to be a capital aim, to form connec|tions with others &s;o &s;trict and &s;o exten&s;ive as to produce a firm reliance on many for &s;uc|cour in time of need. Rea&s;on dictates this le&s;&s;on. But rea&s;on &s;olely is not relied on in a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence. We are moved by a natural appetite, to be &s;olicitous about e&s;teem and re&s;pect as we are about food when hungry. This appetite, at the &s;ame time, is finely adju&s;ted to the moral branch of our con&s;titution, by promoting all the moral virtues. For what infallible means are there to attract love and e&s;teem, other than a virtuous cour&s;e of life? If a man be ju&s;t and beneficent, if he be temperate mo|de&s;t and prudent, he will infallibly gain the e&s;teem and love of all who know him.</P>
<P>The communication of pa&s;&s;ion to related
<PB N="238" REF="249">
objects, is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of the care of Providence, to extend &s;ocial connections as far as the limited nature of man can ad|mit. This communication of pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o far unhappy as to &s;pread the malevolent pa&s;|&s;ions beyond their natural bounds. But let it be remarked, that this unhappy effect re|gards &s;avages only, who give way to male-volent pa&s;&s;ions. Under the di&s;cipline of &s;o|ciety, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubdued, and in a good mea&s;ure eradicated. In their place &s;ucceed the kindly affections, which, meet|ing with all encouragement, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind and govern our whole actions. In this condition, the progre&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion a|long related objects, by &s;preading the kindly affections through a multitude of indivi|duals, hath a glorious effect.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more entertaining to a rational mind, than the oeconomy of the hu|man pa&s;&s;ions, of which I have attempted to give &s;ome faint notion. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that our pa&s;&s;ions, when they happen to &s;well beyond their proper limits, take on a le&s;s regular appearance. Rea&s;on may proclaim our duty, but the will influen|ced
<PB N="239" REF="250">
by pa&s;&s;ion, makes gratification always welcome. Hence the power of pa&s;&s;ion, which, when in exce&s;s, cannot be re&s;i&s;ted but by the utmo&s;t fortitude of mind. It is bent upon gratification; and where proper objects are wanting, it clings to any object at hand without di&s;tinction. Thus joy in&s;pi|red by a fortunate event, is diffu&s;ed upon every per&s;on around by acts of benevolence; and re&s;entment for an atrocious injury done by one out of reach, &s;eizes the fir&s;t object that occurs to vent it&s;elf upon.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING di&s;cour&s;ed in general of e|motions and pa&s;&s;ions, I proceed to a more narrow in&s;pection of &s;ome particulars that &s;erve to unfold the principles of the fine arts. It is the province of a wri|ter upon ethics, to give a full enumeration of all the pa&s;&s;ions; and of each &s;eparately to a&s;&s;ign the nature, the cau&s;e, the gratifi|cation, and the effects. But a treati&s;e of ethics is not my province. I carry my view no farther than to the elements of critici&s;m, in order to &s;how that the fine arts are a &s;ub|ject of rea&s;oning as well as of ta&s;te. An exten&s;ive work would be ill &s;uited to a de|&s;ign &s;o limited; and to keep within mode|rate bounds, the following plan may con|tribute. It has already been ob&s;erved, that things are the cau&s;es of emotions, by means of their properties and attributes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part. 1. &s;ect. 1. fir&s;t note.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="242" REF="253">
furni&s;heth a hint for di&s;tribution. In&s;tead of a painful and tedious examination of the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, I propo&s;e to confine my inquiries to &s;uch attributes, re|lations, and circum&s;tances, as in the fine arts are chiefly employed to rai&s;e agreeable emotions. Attributes of &s;ingle objects, as the mo&s;t &s;imple, &s;hall take the lead; to be followed with particulars that depend on the relations of objects, and are not found in any one object &s;ingly con&s;idered. Di&s;|patching next &s;ome coincident matters, I approach nearer to practice, by applying the principles unfolded in the foregoing parts of the work. This is a general view of the intended method; re&s;erving however a privilege to vary it in particular in&s;tances, where a different method may be more commodious. I begin with beauty, the mo&s;t noted of all the qualities that belong to &s;ingle objects.</P>
<P>The term <HI>beauty,</HI> in its native &s;ignifica|tion, is appropriated to objects of &s;ight. Objects of the other &s;en&s;es may be agree|able, &s;uch as the &s;ounds of mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments, the &s;moothne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s of &s;ome
<PB N="243" REF="254">
&s;urfaces: but the agreeablene&s;s denomina|ted <HI>beauty</HI> belongs to objects of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Of all the objects of the external &s;en&s;es, an object of &s;ight is the mo&s;t complex. In the very &s;imple&s;t, colour is perceived, fi|gure, and length breadth and thickne&s;s. A tree is compo&s;ed of a trunk, branches, and leaves. It has colour, figure, &s;ize, and &s;ometimes motion. By means of each of the&s;e particulars, &s;eparately con&s;idered, it appears beautiful: how much more &s;o, when they enter all into one complex per|ception? The beauty of the human figure is extraordinary, being a compo&s;ition of numberle&s;s beauties ari&s;ing from the parts and qualities of the object, various colours, various motions, figure, &s;ize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>; all u|niting in one complex perception, and &s;tri|king the eye with combined force. Hence it is, that beauty, a quality &s;o remarkable in vi&s;ible objects, lends its name to expre&s;s every thing that is eminently agreeable. Thus, by a figure of &s;peech, we &s;ay a beau|tiful &s;ound, a beautiful thought or expre&s;|&s;ion, a beautiful theorem, a beautiful e|vent, a beautiful di&s;covery in art or &s;cience.
<PB N="244" REF="255">
But as figurative expre&s;&s;ion is not our pre|&s;ent theme, this chapter is confined to beauty in its genuine &s;ignification.</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that a perception &s;o various as that of beauty, comprehending &s;ometimes many particulars, &s;ometimes few, &s;hould occa&s;ion emotions equally various. And yet all the various emotions of beauty maintain one general character of &s;weet|ne&s;s and gaiety.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering attentively the beauty of vi&s;ible objects, we di&s;cover two kinds. One may be termed <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> beauty, becau&s;e it is di&s;covered in a &s;ingle object viewed apart without relation to any other object. The examples above given, are of that kind. The other may be termed <HI>relative</HI> beauty, being founded on the relation of objects. The former is a perception of &s;en&s;e merely; for to perceive the beauty of a &s;preading oak or of a flowing river, no more is required but &s;ingly an act of vi&s;ion. The latter is ac|companied with an act of under&s;tanding and reflection; for of a fine in&s;trument or en|gine, we perceive not the relative beauty, until we be made acquainted with its u&s;e and
<PB N="245" REF="256">
de&s;tination. In a word, intrin&s;ic beauty is ultimate: relative beauty is that of means relating to &s;ome good end or purpo&s;e. The&s;e different beauties agree in one capital cir|cum&s;tance, that both are equally perceived as &s;pread upon the object. This will be readily admitted with re&s;pect to intrin&s;ic beauty; but is not &s;o obvious with re&s;pect to the other. The utility of the plough, for example, may make it an object of admi|ration or of de&s;ire; but why &s;hould utility make it appear beautiful? A principle men|tioned above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>, will explain this doubt. The beauty of the effect, by an ea&s;y tran&s;|ition of ideas, is transferred to the cau&s;e, and is perceived as one of the qualities of the cau&s;e. Thus a &s;ubject void of intrin&s;ic beauty, appears beautiful from its utility. An old Gothic tower that has no beauty in it&s;elf, appears beautiful, con&s;idered as pro|per to defend again&s;t an enemy. A dwel|ling-hou&s;e void of all regularity, is however beautiful in the view of convenience; and the want of form or &s;ymmetry in a tree,
<PB N="246" REF="257">
will not prevent its appearing beautiful, if it be known to produce good fruit.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two beauties concur in any object, it appears delightful. Every mem|ber of the human body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both in a high degree. The &s;lender make of a hor&s;e de&s;tined for running, plea&s;es every ta&s;te; partly from &s;ymmetry, and partly from utility.</P>
<P>The beauty of utility, being proportioned accurately to the degree of utility, requires no illu&s;tration. But intrin&s;ic beauty, &s;o complex as I have &s;aid, cannot be handled di&s;tinctly without being analized into its con&s;tituent parts. If a tree be beautiful by means of its colour, its figure, its &s;ize, its motion, it is in reality po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many different beauties, which ought to be exa|mined &s;eparately, in order to have a clear notion of the whole. The beauty of co|lour is too familiar to need explanation. The beauty of figure requires an accurate di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, for in it many circum&s;tances are in|volved. When any portion of matter is viewed as a whole, the beauty of its figure ari&s;es from regularity and &s;implicity. View|ing
<PB N="247" REF="258">
the parts with relation to each other, uniformity, proportion, and order, contri|bute to its beauty. The beauty of motion de&s;erves a chapter by it&s;elf; and another chapter is de&s;tined for grandeur, being di&s;tingui&s;hable from beauty in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e. For the definitions of regularity, uniformity, proportion, and order, if thought nece&s;&s;ary, I remit my reader to the appendix at the end of the book. Upon &s;implicity I mu&s;t make a few cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, &s;uch as may be of u&s;e in examining the beauty of &s;ingle objects.</P>
<P>A multitude of objects crowding into the mind at once, di&s;turb the attention, and pa&s;s without making any impre&s;&s;ion, or any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion. In a group, no &s;ingle object makes the figure it would do apart, when it occupies the whole attention<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms.</NOTE>. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, even a &s;ingle object, when it divides the attention by the multi|plicity of its parts, equals not, in &s;trength of impre&s;&s;ion, a more &s;imple object com|prehended
<PB N="248" REF="259">
in a &s;ingle view. Parts ex|tremely complex mu&s;t be con&s;idered in por|tions &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and a number of impre&s;|&s;ions in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which cannot unite be|cau&s;e not &s;imultaneous, never touch the mind like one entire impre&s;&s;ion made as it were at one &s;troke. This ju&s;tifies &s;impli|city in works of art, as oppo&s;ed to compli|cated circum&s;tances and crowded orna|ments. There is an additional rea&s;on for &s;implicity, in works that make an impre&s;|&s;ion of dignity or elevation. The mind at|tached to beauties of a high rank, cannot de&s;cend to inferior beauties. And yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;ons, we find pro|fu&s;e decoration prevailing in works of art. But this is no argument again&s;t &s;implicity. For authors and architects who cannot reach the higher beauties, endeavour to &s;up|ply their want of genius by dealing in tho&s;e that are inferior. In all ages, the be&s;t wri|ters and arti&s;ts have been governed by a ta&s;te for &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The&s;e things premi&s;ed, I proceed to exa|mine the beauty of figure, as ari&s;ing from the above-mentioned particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> re|gularity,
<PB N="249" REF="260">
uniformity, proportion, order, and &s;implicity. To exhau&s;t this &s;ubject, would of it&s;elf require a large volume. I li|mit my&s;elf to a few cur&s;ory remarks, as matter for future di&s;qui&s;ition. To inquire why an object, by means of the particulars mentioned, appears beautiful, would I am afraid be a vain attempt. It &s;eems the mo&s;t probable opinion, that the nature of man was originally framed with a reli&s;h for them, in order to an&s;wer wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es. The final cau&s;es have not hitherto been a&s;|certained, though they are not probably beyond our reach. One thing is clear, that regularity, uniformity, order, and &s;implici|ty, contribute each of them to readine&s;s of apprehen&s;ion; and enable us to form more di&s;tinct images of objects, than can be done with the utmo&s;t attention where the&s;e par|ticulars are not found. This final cau&s;e is, I acknowledge, too &s;light, to account &s;a|tisfactorily for a ta&s;te that makes a figure &s;o illu&s;trious in the nature of man. That this branch of our con&s;titution hath a purpo&s;e &s;till more important, we have great rea&s;on to believe. With re&s;pect to proportion, I
<PB N="250" REF="261">
am &s;till le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful. In &s;everal in&s;tances, accurate proportion is connected with utili|ty. This in particular is the ca&s;e of ani|mals; for tho&s;e that are the be&s;t propor|tioned, are the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active. But in&s;tances are &s;till more numerous, where the proportions we reli&s;h the mo&s;t, have no connection, &s;o far as we &s;ee, with utility. Writers on architecture in&s;i&s;t much upon the proportions of a column; and a&s;&s;ign different proportions to the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. But no architect will maintain, that the mo&s;t accurate proportions contribute more to u&s;e, than &s;everal that are le&s;s accu|rate and le&s;s agreeable. Neither will it be maintained, that the proportions a&s;&s;igned for the length breadth and height of rooms, tend to make them the more commodious. It appears then, &s;o far as we can di&s;cover, that we have a ta&s;te for proportion independent altogether of utility. One thing indeed is certain, that any external object proportion|ed to our ta&s;te, is delightful. This furni&s;h|es a hint. May it not be thought a good final cau&s;e of proportion, that it contributes to our entertainment? The author of our
<PB N="251" REF="262">
nature has given many &s;ignal proofs, that this end is not below his care. And if &s;o, why &s;hould we he&s;itate in a&s;&s;igning this as an additional final cau&s;e of regularity, and the other particulars above mentioned? We may be confirmed in this thought, by re|flecting, that our ta&s;te, with re&s;pect to the&s;e, is not occa&s;ional or accidental, but uniform and univer&s;al, making an original branch of human nature.</P>
<P>One might fill a volume with the effects that are produced by the endle&s;s combina|tions of the principles of beauty. I have room only for a &s;light &s;pecimen, confined to the &s;imple&s;t figures. A circle and a &s;quare are each of them perfectly regular, being equal|ly confined to a preci&s;e form, and admitting not the &s;lighte&s;t variation. A &s;quare how|ever is le&s;s beautiful than a circle, becau&s;e it is le&s;s &s;imple. A circle has parts as well as a &s;quare; but its parts not being di&s;tinct like tho&s;e of a &s;quare, it makes one entire impre&s;&s;ion; whereas the attention is divided among the &s;ides and angles of a &s;quare. The effect of &s;implicity may be illu&s;trated by another example. A &s;quare, though not
<PB N="252" REF="263">
more regular than a hexagon or octagon, is more beautiful than either; for what other rea&s;on, than that a &s;quare is more &s;imple, and the attention le&s;s divided? This rea|&s;oning will appear &s;till more &s;olid when we con&s;ider any regular polygon of very many &s;ides; for of &s;uch figure the mind can never have any di&s;tinct perception. Simplicity thus contributes to beauty.</P>
<P>A &s;quare is more beautiful than a paral|lelogram. The former exceeds the latter in regularity and in uniformity of parts. But this holds with re&s;pect to intrin&s;ic beauty only; for in many in&s;tances, utility comes in to ca&s;t the balance on the &s;ide of the pa|rallelogram. This figure for the doors and windows of a dwelling-hou&s;e, is preferred becau&s;e of utility; and here we find the beau|ty of utility prevailing over that of regula|rity and uniformity.</P>
<P>A parallelogram again depends, for its beauty, on the proportion of its &s;ides. The beauty is lo&s;t by a great inequality of &s;ides. It is al&s;o lo&s;t, on the other hand, by the ap|proximation toward equality. Proportion in this circum&s;tance degenerates into imper|fect
<PB N="253" REF="264">
uniformity; and the figure upon the whole appears an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to|ward a &s;quare.</P>
<P>An equilateral triangle yields not to a &s;quare in regularity nor in uniformity of parts, and it is more &s;imple. But an equi|lateral triangle is le&s;s beautiful than a &s;quare, which mu&s;t be owing to inferiority of order in the po&s;ition of its parts. The &s;ides of an equilateral triangle incline to each other in the &s;ame angle, which is the mo&s;t perfect order they are &s;u&s;ceptible of. But this order is ob&s;cure, and far from being &s;o perfect as the paralleli&s;m of the &s;ides of a &s;quare. Thus order contributes to the beauty of vi&s;i|ble objects, not le&s;s than &s;implicity and regu|larity.</P>
<P>A parallelogram exceeds an equilateral triangle in the orderly di&s;po&s;ition of its parts; but being inferior in uniformity and &s;impli|city, it is le&s;s beautiful.</P>
<P>Uniformity is &s;ingular in one capital cir|cum&s;tance, that it is apt to di&s;gu&s;t by ex|ce&s;s. A number of things contrived for the &s;ame u&s;e, &s;uch as chairs &s;poons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> can|not be too uniform. But a &s;crupulous uni|formity
<PB N="254" REF="265">
of parts in a large garden or field, is far from being agreeable. Uniformity a|mong connected objects, belongs not to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. It is handled in the chap|ter of uniformity and variety.</P>
<P>In all the works of nature, &s;implicity makes an illu&s;trious figure. The works of the be&s;t arti&s;ts are directed by it. Profu&s;e ornament in painting, gardening, or archi|tecture, as well as in dre&s;s and language, &s;hows a mean or corrupted ta&s;te.
<Q><L>Poets, like painters, thus un&s;kill'd to trace</L>
<L>The naked nature and the living grace,</L>
<L>With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,</L>
<L>And hide with ornaments their want of art.</L>
<BIBL>Pope's E&s;&s;ay on critici&s;m.</BIBL></Q>
No one property recommends a machine more than its &s;implicity; not &s;ingly for bet|ter an&s;wering its purpo&s;e, but by appearing in it&s;elf more beautiful. Simplicity hath a capital effect in behaviour and manners; no other particular contributing more to gain e&s;teem and love. The artificial and intricate manners of modern times, have little of
<PB N="255" REF="266">
dignity in them. General theorems, ab&s;|tracting from their importance, are delight|ful by their &s;implicity, and by the ea&s;ine&s;s of their application to a variety of ca&s;es. We take equal delight in the laws of motion, which, with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, are boundle&s;s in their influence.</P>
<P>A gradual progre&s;s from &s;implicity to com|plex forms and profu&s;e ornament, &s;eems to be the fate of all the fine arts; re&s;embling behaviour, which from original candor and &s;implicity has degenerated into artificial re|finements. At pre&s;ent, written productions are crowded with words, epithets, figures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In mu&s;ic, &s;entiment is neglected, for the luxury of harmony, and for difficult movement which &s;urpri&s;es in its execution. In <HI>ta&s;te</HI> properly &s;o called, poignant &s;auces with complicated mixtures of different &s;a|vours, prevail among people of condition. The French, accu&s;tomed to the artificial red on their women's cheeks, think the mode&s;t colouring of nature di&s;played on a fine face altogether in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>The &s;ame tendency appears in the pro|gre&s;s of the arts among the ancients. Of
<PB N="256" REF="267">
this we have traces &s;till remaining in archi|tecture. Some ve&s;tiges of the olde&s;t Gre|cian buildings prove them to be of the Doric order. The Ionic &s;ucceeded, and &s;eems to have been the favourite order, while archi|tecture was in its height of glory. The Corinthian came next in vogue: and in Greece, the buildings of that order appear mo&s;tly to have been erected after the Ro|mans got footing there. At la&s;t came the Compo&s;ite with all its extravagancies, where proportion is &s;acrificed to finery and crowded ornament.</P>
<P>But what ta&s;te is to prevail next? for fa|&s;hion is in a continual flux, and ta&s;te mu&s;t vary with it. After rich and profu&s;e orna|ments become familiar, &s;implicity appears by contra&s;t lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid. This would be an un&s;urmountable ob&s;truction, &s;hould any man of genius and ta&s;te endeavour to re&s;tore ancient &s;implicity.</P>
<P>In reviewing what is &s;aid above, I am under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of an objection, which, as it may po&s;&s;ibly occur to the read|er, ought to be obviated. A mountain, it will be ob&s;erved, is an agreeable object,
<PB N="257" REF="268">
without &s;o much as the appearance of regu|larity; and a chain of mountains &s;till more agreeable, without being arranged in any order. But the&s;e facts con&s;idered in a pro|per light, afford not an objection. Regu|larity, order, and uniformity, are intimately connected with beauty; and in this view only, have I treated them. Every regular object, for example, mu&s;t in re&s;pect of its re|gularity be beautiful. But I have not &s;aid, that regularity, order, and uniformity, are e&s;&s;ential to beauty, &s;o as that it cannot exi&s;t without them. The contrary appears in the beauty of colour. Far le&s;s have I &s;aid, that an object cannot be agreeable in any re&s;pect independent of the&s;e qualities. Grandeur, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from beauty, requires very little regularity. This will appear more ful|ly when that article is handled. In the mean time, to &s;how the difference betwixt beauty and grandeur with re&s;pect to regula|rity, I &s;hall give a few examples. Imagine a &s;mall body, let it be a globe, in a conti|nual flux of figure, from the mo&s;t perfect regularity till there remain no appearance of that quality. The beauty of this globe,
<PB N="258" REF="269">
depending on its regular figure, will gra|dually wear away with its regularity; and when it is no longer regular, it no longer will appear beautiful. The next example &s;hall be of the &s;ame globe, gradually enlar|ging its &s;ize, but retaining its figure. In this body, we at fir&s;t perceive the beauty of regularity only. But &s;o &s;oon as it begins to &s;well into a great &s;ize, it appears agreeable by its greatne&s;s, which joins with the beau|ty of regularity to make it a delightful object. In the la&s;t place, let it be imagined, that the figure as well as the quantity of matter are in a continual flux; and that the body, while it increa&s;es in &s;ize, becomes le&s;s and le&s;s regular, till it lo&s;e altogether the appear|ance of that quality. In this ca&s;e, the beauty of regularity wearing off gradually, gives place to an agreeablene&s;s of a different &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> that of greatne&s;s: and at la&s;t the emotion ari|&s;ing from greatne&s;s will be in perfection, when the beauty of regularity is gone. Hence it is, that in a large object the want of regula|rity is not much regarded by the &s;pectator who is &s;truck with its grandeur. A &s;welling eminence is agreeable, though not &s;trictly
<PB N="259" REF="270">
regular. A towering hill is delightful, if it have but any di&s;tant re&s;emblance of a cone. A &s;mall &s;urface ought to be &s;mooth; but in a wide-extended plain, con&s;iderable inequa|lities are overlooked. This ob&s;ervation holds equally in works of art. The &s;light|e&s;t irregularity in a hou&s;e of a moderate &s;ize hurts the eye; while the mind, &s;truck with the grandeur of a &s;uperb edifice, which oc|cupies it totally, cannot bear to de&s;cend to its irregularities unle&s;s extremely gro&s;s. In a large volume we pardon many defects that would make an epigram intolerable. In &s;hort, the ob&s;ervation holds in general, that beauty is connected with regularity in great objects as well as in &s;mall; but with a re|markable difference, that in pa&s;&s;ing from &s;mall to great, regularity is le&s;s and le&s;s re|quired.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction betwixt primary and &s;e|condary qualities in matter, &s;eems now ful|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed. Heat and cold, though &s;eeming to exi&s;t in bodies, are di&s;covered to be effects cau&s;ed by the&s;e bodies in a &s;en&s;i|tive being. Colour, which the eye repre|&s;ents as &s;pread upon a &s;ub&s;tance, has no ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="260" REF="271">
but in the mind of the &s;pectator. Perceptions of this kind, which, by a de|lu&s;ion of &s;en&s;e, are attributed to external &s;ubjects, are termed <HI>&s;econdary qualities,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to figure, exten&s;ion, &s;oli|dity, which are primary qualities, and which are not &s;eparable, even in imagina|tion, from the &s;ubjects they belong to. This &s;ugge&s;ts a curious inquiry, Whether beauty be a primary or only a &s;econdary quality of objects? The que&s;tion is ea&s;ily determined with re&s;pect to the beauty of colour; for if colour be a &s;econdary quality exi&s;ting no where but in the mind of the &s;pectator, its beauty mu&s;t be of the &s;ame kind. This con|clu&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o hold with re&s;pect to the beauty of utility, which is plainly a concep|tion of the mind, ari&s;ing not merely from &s;ight, but from reflecting that the thing is fitted for &s;ome good end or purpo&s;e. The que&s;tion is more intricate with re&s;pect to the beauty of regularity. If regularity be a primary quality, why not al&s;o its beauty? That this is not a good con&s;equence, will appear from con&s;idering, that beauty, in its very conception, refers to a percipient; for
<PB N="261" REF="272">
an object is &s;aid to be beautiful, for no other rea&s;on but that it appears &s;o to a &s;pectator. The &s;ame piece of matter which to man appears beautiful, may po&s;&s;ibly to an|other being appear ugly. Beauty therefore, which for its exi&s;tence depends upon the percipient as much as upon the object percei|ved, cannot be an inherent property of either. What el&s;e then can it be, but a perception in the mind occa&s;ioned by certain objects? The &s;ame rea&s;oning is applicable to the beauty of order, of uniformity, of gran|deur. Accordingly, it may be pronounced in general, that beauty in no ca&s;e whatever is a real quality of matter. And hence it is wittily ob&s;erved by the poet, that beauty is not in the countenance, but in the lover's eye. This rea&s;oning is undoubtedly &s;olid: and the only cau&s;e of doubt or he&s;itation is, that we are taught a different le&s;&s;on by &s;en&s;e. By a &s;ingular determination of na|ture, we perceive both beauty and colour as belonging to the object; and, like figure or exten&s;ion, as inherent properties. This mechani&s;m is uncommon; and when na|ture, to fulfil her intention, chu&s;eth any
<PB N="262" REF="273">
&s;ingular method of operation, we may be certain of &s;ome final cau&s;e that cannot be reached by ordinary means. It appears to me, that a perception of beauty in external objects, is requi&s;ite to attach us to them. Doth not this mechani&s;m, in the fir&s;t place, greatly promote indu&s;try, by prompting a de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s things that are beautiful? Doth it not further join with utility, in prompting us to embelli&s;h our hou&s;es and enrich our fields? The&s;e how|ever are but &s;light effects, compared with the connections which are formed among individuals in &s;ociety by means of this &s;in|gular mechani&s;m. The qualifications of the head and heart, are undoubtedly the mo&s;t &s;olid and mo&s;t permanent foundations of &s;uch connections. But as external beauty lies more in view, and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind than the qualities now mentioned, the &s;en&s;e of beauty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the more univer&s;al influence in forming the&s;e connections. At any rate, it concurs in an eminent degree with mental qualifications, to produce &s;ocial intercour&s;e, mutual good|will,
<PB N="263" REF="274">
and con&s;equently mutual aid and &s;upport, which are the life of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not however be overlooked, that this &s;en&s;e doth not tend to advance the in|tere&s;ts of &s;ociety, but when in a due mean with re&s;pect to &s;trength. Love in particu|lar ari&s;ing from a &s;en&s;e of beauty, lo&s;es, when exce&s;&s;ive, its &s;ociable character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>. The appetite for gratification, prevailing over affection for the beloved object, is ungo|vernable; and tends violently to its end, regardle&s;s of the mi&s;ery that mu&s;t follow. Love in this &s;tate is no longer a &s;weet a|greeable pa&s;&s;ion. It becomes painful like hunger or thir&s;t; and produceth no hap|pine&s;s but in the in&s;tant of fruition. This di&s;covery &s;ugge&s;ts a mo&s;t important le&s;&s;on, that moderation in our de&s;ires and appetites, which fits us for doing our duty, contributes at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t to happine&s;s. Even &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, when mo|derate, are more plea&s;ant than when they &s;well beyond proper bounds.</P>

<P>The emotions rai&s;ed by great and by e|levated objects, are clearly di&s;tingui&s;hable, not only in the internal feeling, but even in their external expre&s;&s;ions. A great object dilates the brea&s;t, and makes the &s;pectator endeavour to enlarge his bulk. This is remarkable in per&s;ons, who, neglecting delicacy in behaviour, give way to nature without re&s;erve. In de&s;cribing a great ob|ject, they naturally expand them&s;elves by drawing in air with all their force. An e|levated object produces a different expre&s;|&s;ion. It makes the &s;pectator &s;tretch up|ward and &s;tand a tiptoe.</P>

<PB N="267" REF="278">
this an appearance as if grandeur were not an emotion di&s;tinct from all others, but only a circum&s;tance that qualifies beauty and de|formity?</P>
<P>I am notwith&s;tanding &s;atisfied, that gran|deur is an emotion, not only di&s;tinct from all others, but in every circum&s;tance plea|&s;ant. The&s;e propo&s;itions mu&s;t be exami|ned &s;eparately. I begin with the former, and &s;hall endeavour to prove, that magni|tude produceth a peculiar emotion di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from all others. Magnitude is undoubtedly a real property of bodies, not le&s;s than figure, and more than colour. Figure and colour, even in the &s;ame body, produce &s;eparate emotions, which are ne|ver mi&s;apprehended one for the other. Why &s;hould not magnitude produce an emotion different from both? That it has this effect, will be evident from a plain experiment of two bodies, one great and one little, which produce different emotions, though they be preci&s;ely the &s;ame as to figure and co|lour. There is indeed an ob&s;curity in this matter, occa&s;ioned by the following circum|&s;tance, that the grandeur and beauty of the
<PB N="268" REF="279">
&s;ame object mix &s;o intimately as &s;carce to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the beauty of colour comes in happily to enable us to make the di&s;tinction. For the emotion of colour u|nites with that of figure, not le&s;s intimately than grandeur does with either. Yet the emotion of colour is di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of figure; and &s;o is grandeur, atten|tively con&s;idered: though when the&s;e three emotions are blended together, they are &s;carce felt as different emotions.</P>
<P>Next, that grandeur is an emotion in e|very circum&s;tance plea&s;ant, appears from the following con&s;iderations. Magnitude or greatne&s;s, ab&s;tracted from all other circum|&s;tances, &s;wells the heart and dilates the mind. We feel this to be a plea&s;ant effect; and we feel no &s;uch effect in contracting the mind upon little objects. This may be illu&s;trated by con&s;idering grandeur in an e|nemy. Beauty is an agreeable quality, whether in a friend or enemy; and when the emotion it rai&s;eth is mixed with re&s;ent|ment again&s;t an enemy, it mu&s;t have the effect to moderate our re&s;entment. In the &s;ame manner, grandeur in an enemy, un|doubtedly
<PB N="269" REF="280">
foftens and blunts our re&s;entment. Grandeur indeed may indirectly and by re|flection produce an unplea&s;ant effect. Gran|deur in an enemy, like courage, may in|crea&s;e our fear, when we con&s;ider the ad|vantage he hath over us by this quality. But the &s;ame indirect effect may be produced by many other agreeable qualities, &s;uch as beauty or wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The magnitude of an ugly object, &s;erves, it is true, to augment our horror or aver|&s;ion. But this proceeds not from magni|tude &s;eparately con&s;idered. It proceeds from the following circum&s;tance, that in a large object a great quantity of ugly parts are pre&s;ented to view.</P>
<P>The &s;ame chain of rea&s;oning is &s;o ob|viou&s;ly applicable to &s;ublimity, that it would be lo&s;ing time to &s;how the application. Grandeur therefore and &s;ublimity &s;hall hereafter be con&s;idered both of them as plea&s;ant emotions.</P>

unhappy for man, were an object di&s;agree|able from its being of a &s;mall &s;ize merely, when he is &s;urrounded with &s;o many ob|jects of that kind. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to elevation of place. A body placed high is agreeable; but the &s;ame body placed low, is not by that circum&s;tance rendered di&s;agreeable. Littlene&s;s, and low|ne&s;s of place, are preci&s;ely &s;imilar in the fol|lowing particular, that they neither give plea&s;ure nor pain. And in this may vi&s;ibly be di&s;covered peculiar attention in fitting the internal con&s;titution of man to his exter|nal circum&s;tances. Were littlene&s;s, and lowne&s;s of place agreeable, greatne&s;s and elevation could not be &s;o.

<P>The difference betwixt great and little with re&s;pect to agreeablene&s;s, is remarkably felt in a &s;eries when we pa&s;s gradually from the one extreme to the other. A mental progre&s;s from the capital to the kingdom, from that to Europe&mdash;to the whole earth&mdash;to the planetary &s;y&s;tem&mdash;to the univer&s;e, is extremely plea&s;ant: the heart &s;wells and

the mind is dilated, at every &s;tep. The re|turning in an oppo&s;ite direction is not po&s;i|tively painful, though our plea&s;ure le&s;&s;ens at every &s;tep, till it vani&s;h into indifference. Such a progre&s;s may &s;ometimes produce a plea&s;ure of a different &s;ort, which ari&s;es from taking a narrower and narrower in&s;pection. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to a pro|gre&s;s upward and downward. A&s;cent is plea&s;ant becau&s;e it elevates us. But de&s;cent is never painful: it is for the mo&s;t part plea|&s;ant from a different cau&s;e, that it is accor|ding to the order of nature. The fall of a &s;tone from anyheight, is extremely agreeable by its accelerated motion. I feel it plea&s;ant to de&s;cend from a mountain: the de&s;cent is natural and ea&s;y. Neither is looking downward painful. On the contrary, to look down upon objects, makes part of the plea&s;ure of elevation. Looking down be|comes then only painful when the object is &s;o far below as to create dizzine&s;s: and even when that is the ca&s;e, we feel a &s;ort of plea|&s;ure mixt with the pain.

<P>An ob&s;ervation is made above, that the emotions of grandeur and &s;ublimity are nearly allied. Hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the other. I give an example. An increa&s;ing &s;eries of num|bers produceth an emotion &s;imilar to that of mounting upward, and for that rea&s;on is commonly termed <HI>an a&s;cending &s;eries.</HI> A &s;eries of numbers gradually decrea&s;ing, pro|duceth an emotion &s;imilar to that of going downward, and for that rea&s;on is common|ly

termed <HI>a de&s;cending &s;eries.</HI> We talk fa|miliarly of going up to the capital, and of going down to the country.

<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervation leads us natu|rally to con&s;ider grandeur and &s;ublimity in a figurative &s;en&s;e, and as applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto I have con&s;idered the&s;e terms in their proper meaning, as applicable to objects of &s;ight only: and I thought it of importance, to be&s;tow &s;ome pains upon that article; becau&s;e, generally &s;peaking, the figurative &s;en&s;e of a word is derived from its proper &s;en&s;e; which will be found to hold in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Beauty in its original &s;ig|nification, is confined to objects of &s;ight. But as many other objects, intellectual as well as moral, rai&s;e emotions re&s;embling that
<PB N="276" REF="289">
of beauty, the re&s;emblance of the effects prompts us naturally to extend the term <HI>beauty</HI> to the&s;e objects. This equally ac|counts for the terms <HI>grandeur</HI> and <HI>&s;ublimity</HI> taken in a figurative &s;en&s;e. Every emotion, from whatever cau&s;e proceeding, that re|&s;embles an emotion of grandeur or eleva|tion, is called by the &s;ame name. Thus genero&s;ity is &s;aid to be an elevated emotion, as well as great courage; and that firmne&s;s of &s;oul which is &s;uperior to misfortunes, ob|tains the peculiar name of <HI>magnanimity.</HI> On the other hand, every emotion that con|tracts the mind and fixeth it upon things trivial or of no importance, is termed <HI>low,</HI> by its re&s;emblance to an emotion produced by a little or low object of &s;ight. Thus an appetite for trifling amu&s;ements, is called <HI>a low ta&s;te.</HI> The &s;ame terms are applied to characters and actions. We talk familiarly of an elevated genius, of a great man, and equally &s;o of littlene&s;s of mind. Some ac|tions are great and elevated, others are low and groveling. Sentiments and even ex|pre&s;&s;ions are characteri&s;ed in the &s;ame man|ner. An expre&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment that rai|&s;es
<PB N="277" REF="290">
the mind, is denominated <HI>great</HI> or <HI>ele|vated</HI>; and hence the &s;ublime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Longinus gives a pretty good de&s;cription of the &s;ublime, though not entirely ju&s;t in every one of the circum&s;tances, <Q REND="inline">"That the mind is elevated by it, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected as to &s;well in tran&s;port and inward pride, as if what is only heard or read, were its own invention."</Q> But he adheres not to this de&s;cription. In his 6th chapter he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that many pa&s;&s;ions have nothing of the grand, &s;uch as grief, fear, pity, which depre&s;s the mind in&s;tead of rai&s;ing it. And yet in chapter 8th, he mentions Sappho's ode upon love as &s;ublime. Beautiful it is undoubtedly, but it cannot be &s;ublime, becau&s;e it really depre&s;&s;es the mind in&s;tead of rai&s;ing it. His tran&s;lator Boileau is not more &s;ucce&s;sful in his in&s;tances. In his 10th reflection he cites a pa&s;&s;age from Demo&s;thenes and another from Herodotus as &s;ublime, which are not &s;o.</P></NOTE> in poetry. In &s;uch figurative terms, the di&s;tinction is lo&s;t that is made betwixt <HI>great</HI> and <HI>elevated</HI> in their proper &s;en&s;e; for the re&s;emblance is not &s;o entire, as to pre&s;erve the&s;e terms di&s;tinct in their figurative application. We carry this figure &s;till farther. Elevation in its proper &s;en&s;e, includes &s;uperiority of place; and lowne&s;s, inferiority of place. Hence a man of &s;uperior talents, of &s;uperior rank, of inferior parts, of inferior ta&s;te, and &s;uch like. The veneration we have for our ance&s;tors and for the ancients in general, being &s;imi|lar
<PB N="278" REF="291">
to the emotion produced by an elevated object of &s;ight, ju&s;tifies the figurative expre&s;|&s;ion, of the ancients being rai&s;ed above us, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;uperior place. And we may remark by the way, that as words are inti|mately connected with ideas, many, by this form of expre&s;&s;ion, are led to conceive their ance&s;tors as really above them in place, and their po&s;terity below them:

The notes of the gamut, proceeding regu|larly from the blunter or gro&s;&s;er &s;ounds to tho&s;e which are more acute and piercing, produce in the hearer a feeling &s;omewhat &s;imilar to what is produced by mounting upward; and this gives occa&s;ion to the fi|gurative expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>a high note, a low note.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the re&s;emblance in feeling be|twixt real and figurative grandeur, that among the nations on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of A|fric, who are directed purely by nature, the

Again, it is a rule in painting, that figures of a &s;mall &s;ize are proper for grote&s;que pieces; but that in an hi&s;torical &s;ubject, which is grand and important, the figures ought to be as great as the life. The re&s;emblance of the&s;e feelings is in reality &s;o &s;trong, that elevation in a figurative &s;en&s;e is ob&s;erved to have the &s;ame effect even externally, that real eleva|tion has: <Q><SP>

<P>The re&s;emblance in feeling betwixt real and figurative grandeur, is humorou&s;ly il|lu&s;trated by Addi&s;on in critici&s;ing upon the Engli&s;h tragedy. <Q REND="inline">"The ordinary me|thod

As the&s;e &s;uperfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man, a prince&s;s gene|rally receives her grandeur from tho&s;e additional incumbrances that fall into her tail. I mean the broad &s;weeping train that follows her in all her motions, and finds con&s;tant employment for a boy who &s;tands behind her to open and &s;pread it to advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N^o 42.</NOTE>."</Q> The Scythians, im|pre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame of Alexander, were a&s;toni&s;hed when they found him a little man.</P>

<P>In order to have a ju&s;t conception of grandeur and &s;ublimity, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, that within certain limits they produce their &s;tronge&s;t effects, which le&s;&s;en by exce&s;s as well as by defect. This is re|markable in grandeur and &s;ublimity taken in their proper &s;en&s;e. The &s;tronge&s;t emo|tion of grandeur is rai&s;ed by an object that can be taken in at one view. An object &s;o immen&s;e as not to be compre|hended but in parts, tends rather to di&s;tract than &s;atisfy the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by Addi&s;on, that perhaps a man would have been more a&s;toni&s;hed with the maje&s;tic air that appeared in one of Ly&s;ippus's &s;tatues of Alexander, though no bigger than the life, than he might have been with Mount Athos, had it been cut into the figure of the hero, according to the propo&s;al of Phidias, with a river in one hand and a ci|ty in the other. <HI>Spectator,</HI> N^o 415.</NOTE> In like manner, the &s;tronge&s;t emotion produced by elevation is where the object is &s;een di&s;tinctly. A greater elevation le&s;&s;ens in appearance the

The &s;ame is equally re|markable in figurative grandeur and eleva|tion, which &s;hall be handled together, be|cau&s;e, as ob&s;erved above, they are &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable. Sentiments may be &s;o &s;trained, as to become ob&s;cure, or to exceed the capacity of the human mind. Again&s;t &s;uch licence of imagination, every good writer will be upon his guard. And there|fore it is of greater importance to ob&s;erve, that even the true &s;ublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the high|e&s;t entertainment. We are undoubtedly &s;u&s;ceptible of a greater elevation than can be in&s;pired by human actions the mo&s;t heroic and magnanimous; witne&s;s what we feel from Milton's de&s;cription of &s;uperior beings. Yet every man mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a more con&s;tant and plea&s;ant elevation, when the hi&s;tory of his own &s;pecies is the &s;ubject. He enjoys an elevation equal to that of the greate&s;t hero, of an Alexander or a Cae&s;ar, of a Brutus or an Epaminondas. He ac|companies the&s;e heroes in their &s;ublime&s;t &s;entiments and mo&s;t hazardous exploits,
<PB N="283" REF="296">
with a magnanimity equal to theirs; and finds it no &s;tretch to pre&s;erve the &s;ame tone of mind for hours together, without &s;inking. The ca&s;e is by no means the &s;ame in de|&s;cribing the actions or qualities of &s;uperior beings. The reader's imagination cannot keep pace with that of the poet; and the mind, unable to &s;upport it&s;elf in a &s;trained elevation, falls as from a height; and the fall is immoderate like the elevation. Where this effect is not felt, it mu&s;t be prevented by &s;ome ob&s;curity in the conception, which frequently attends the de&s;cription of un|known objects.</P>
<P>On the other hand, objects of &s;ight that are not remarkably great or high, &s;carce rai&s;e any emotion of grandeur or &s;ublimity; and the &s;ame holds in other objects. The mind is often rou&s;ed and animated without being carried to the height of grandeur or &s;ublimity. This difference may be di&s;cern|ed in many &s;orts of mu&s;ic, as well as in &s;ome mu&s;ical in&s;truments.

When the &s;ublime is carried to its due height and circum&s;cribed within proper bounds, it inchants the mind and rai&s;es the mo&s;t delightful of all emotions. The read|er, ingro&s;&s;ed by a &s;ublime object, feels him&s;elf rai&s;ed as it were to a higher rank. When &s;uch is the ca&s;e, it is not wonderful that the hi&s;tory of conquerors and heroes &s;hould be univer&s;ally the favourite entertain|ment.

<P>The attachment we have to things grand or lofty may be thought to proceed from an unwearied inclination we have to be exalt|ed. No de&s;ire is more univer&s;al than to be re&s;pected and honoured. Upon that ac|count chiefly, are we ambitious of power, riches, titles, fame, which would &s;uddenly lo&s;e their reli&s;h, did they not rai&s;e us above others, and command &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and defe|rence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">Hone&s;tum per &s;e e&s;&s;e expetendum indicant pueri, in qui|bus, ut in &s;peculis, natura cernitur.

But the preference given to things grand and &s;ublime mu&s;t have a deeper root in human nature. Many be&s;tow their time
<PB N="287" REF="300">
upon low and trifling amu&s;ements, without &s;howing any de&s;ire to be exalted. Yet the&s;e very per&s;ons talk the &s;ame language with the re&s;t of mankind; and at lea&s;t in their judgement, if not in their ta&s;te, prefer the more elevated plea&s;ures. They acknow|ledge a more refined ta&s;te, and are a&s;hamed of their own as low and groveling. This &s;entiment, con&s;tant and univer&s;al, mu&s;t be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human nature to every object that elevates the mind. Some men may have a greater reli&s;h for an object not of the highe&s;t rank: but they are con|&s;cious of the common nature of man, and that it ought not to be &s;ubjected to their peculiar ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The irregular influence of grandeur, reaches al&s;o to other matters. However good, hone&s;t, or u&s;eful, a man may be, he is not &s;o much re&s;pected, as one of a more elevated character is, though of le&s;s integrity; nor do the misfortunes of the former affect us &s;o much as tho&s;e of the latter. I add, becau&s;e it cannot be di&s;gui|&s;ed, that the remor&s;e which attends breach
<PB N="288" REF="301">
of engagement, is in a great mea&s;ure pro|portioned to the figure that the injured per|&s;on makes. The vows and prote&s;tations of lovers are an illu&s;trious example of this ob|&s;ervation; for the&s;e commonly are little re|garded when made to women of inferior rank.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid &s;ugge&s;ts a capital rule for reaching the &s;ublime in &s;uch works of art as are &s;u&s;ceptible of it; and that is, to put in view tho&s;e parts or circum&s;tances only which make the greate&s;t figure, keeping out of &s;ight every thing that is low or trivial. Such judicious &s;election of capital circum&s;tances, is by an eminent critic &s;tyled <HI>grandeur of manner</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N^o 415.</NOTE>. The mind, from an elevation in&s;pired by important objects, cannot, without reluctance, be forced down to be|&s;tow any &s;hare of its attention upon trifles. In none of the fine arts is there &s;o great &s;cope for this rule as in poetry, which, by that means, enjoys a remarkable power of be&s;towing upon objects and events an air of grandeur. When we are &s;pectators, every
<PB N="289" REF="302">
minute object pre&s;ents it&s;elf in its order. But in de&s;cribing at &s;econd hand, the&s;e are laid a&s;ide, and the capital objects are brought clo&s;e together. A judicious ta&s;te in &s;electing, after this manner, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting incidents to give them an united force, accounts for a fact which at fir&s;t &s;ight may appear &s;urpri&s;ing, that we are more moved by a poetical narrative at &s;e|cond hand, than when we are &s;pectators of the event it&s;elf in all its circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Longinus exemplifies the foregoing rule by a compari&s;on of two pa&s;&s;ages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 8. of the Sublime.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t from Ari&s;taeus is thus tran&s;lated.

<L>And wander oceans in pur&s;uit of wo.</L>

In the latter pa&s;&s;age, the mo&s;t &s;triking circum&s;tances are &s;elected to fill the mind with the grand and terrible. The former is a collection of minute and low circum|&s;tances, which &s;catter the thought and make no impre&s;&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;age at the &s;ame time is full of verbal antithe&s;es and low conceit, extremely improper in a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s. But this la&s;t ob&s;ervation is made occa&s;ionally only, as it belongs not to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age from the twenty|fir&s;t book of the Ody&s;&s;ey, deviates widely
<PB N="291" REF="304">
from the rule above laid down. It con|cerns that part of the hi&s;tory of Penelope and her &s;uitors, in which &s;he is made to declare in favour of him who &s;hould prove the mo&s;t dexterous in &s;hooting with the bow of Uly&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Virgil &s;ometimes errs again&s;t this rule. In the following pa&s;&s;ages minute circum|&s;tances are brought into full view; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, they are de&s;cribed in all

And the la&s;t, which is a de&s;cription of a funeral, is the le&s;s ex|cu&s;eable, as it relates to a man who makes no figure in the poem.</P>
<P>The &s;peech of Clytemne&s;tra, de&s;cending from her chariot in the Iphigenia of Euri|pides, beginning of act 3. is &s;tuffed with a number of low, common, and trivial cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But of all writers Lucan in this article is the mo&s;t injudicious. The &s;ea-fight be|twixt the Romans and Ma&s;&s;ilians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3. beginning at line 567.</NOTE>, is de|&s;cribed &s;o much in detail without exhibiting any grand or general view, that the reader is quite fatigued with endle&s;s circum&s;tances, and never feels any degree of elevation. And yet there are &s;ome fine incidents, tho&s;e for example of the two brothers, and of the old man and his &s;on, which, &s;eparated from the re&s;t, would affect us greatly.

<P>To the&s;e I venture to oppo&s;e a pa&s;&s;age from an old hi&s;torical ballad:
<Q><L>Go, little page, tell Hardiknute</L>
<L>That lives on hill &s;o high<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>High,</HI> in the old Scotch language, is pronounced <HI>hee.</HI></NOTE>,</L>
<L>To draw his &s;word, the dread of faes,</L>
<L>And ha&s;te to follow me.</L>
<L>The little page flew &s;wift as dart</L>
<L>Flung by his ma&s;ter's arm.</L>
<L>Come down, come down, Lord Hardiknute,</L>
<L>And rid your king from harm.</L></Q></P>
<P>This rule is al&s;o applicable to other fine arts. In painting it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the principal figure mu&s;t be put in the &s;trong|e&s;t light; that the beauty of attitude con&s;i&s;ts in placing the nobler parts mo&s;t in view, and in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;maller parts as much as po&s;&s;ible; that the folds of the drapery mu&s;t be few and large; that fore&s;hortenings are bad, becau&s;e they make the parts ap|pear
<PB N="294" REF="307">
little; and that the mu&s;cles ought to be kept as entire as po&s;&s;ible, without being di|vided into &s;mall &s;ections. Every one at pre|&s;ent is &s;en&s;ible of the importance of this rule when applied to gardening, in oppo&s;i|tion to the antiquated ta&s;te of parterres &s;plit into a thou&s;and &s;mall parts in the &s;tricte&s;t regularity of figure. Tho&s;e who have &s;uc|ceeded be&s;t in architecture, have governed them&s;elves by this rule in all their models.</P>
<P>Another rule chiefly regards the &s;ublime, though it may be applied to every literary performance intended for amu&s;ement; and that is, to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible ab&s;tract and general terms. Such terms, perfectly well fitted for rea&s;oning and for conveying in&s;truction, &s;erve but imperfectly the ends of poetry. They &s;tand upon the &s;ame foot|ing with mathematical &s;igns, contrived to expre&s;s our thoughts in a conci&s;e manner. But images, which are the life of poetry, cannot be rai&s;ed in any perfection, otherwi&s;e than by introducing particular objects. Ge|neral terms, that comprehend a number of individuals, mu&s;t be excepted from this rule. Our kindred, our clan, our country,
<PB N="295" REF="308">
and words of the like import, though they &s;carce rai&s;e any image, have notwith&s;tand|ing a wonderful power over our pa&s;&s;ions. The greatne&s;s of the complex object over|balances the ob&s;curity of the image.</P>
<P>What I have further to &s;ay upon this &s;ub|ject, &s;hall be comprehended in a few ob|&s;ervations. A man is capable of being rai|&s;ed &s;o much above his ordinary pitch by an emotion of grandeur, that it is extremely difficult by a &s;ingle thought or expre&s;&s;ion to produce that emotion in perfection. The ri&s;e mu&s;t be gradual and the re&s;ult of reite|rated impre&s;&s;ions. The effect of a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion can be but momentary; and if one feel &s;uddenly &s;omewhat like a &s;welling or exaltation of mind, the emotion vani&s;h|eth as &s;oon as felt. Single expre&s;&s;ions, I know, are often ju&s;tly cited as examples of the &s;ublime. But then their effect is no|thing compared with a grand &s;ubject di&s;|played in its capital parts. I &s;hall give a few examples, that the reader may judge for him&s;elf. In the famous action of Thermo|pylae, where Leonidas the Spartan King with his cho&s;en band fighting for their
<PB N="296" REF="309">
country, were cut off to the la&s;t man, a &s;aying is reported of Dieneces one of the band, which, expre&s;&s;ing chearful and un|di&s;turbed bravery, is well intitled to the fir&s;t place in examples of this kind. Talking of the number of their enemies, it was ob&s;er|ved, that the arrows &s;hot by &s;uch a multi|tude would intercept the light of the &s;un. So much the better, &s;ays he; for we &s;hall then fight in the &s;hade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, book 7.</NOTE>.

Such a &s;entiment from a man expiring of his wounds, is truly heroic, and mu&s;t ele|vate the mind to the greate&s;t height that can be done by a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion. It will not
<PB N="297" REF="310">
&s;uffer in a compari&s;on with the famous &s;en|timent <HI>Qu'il mourut</HI> in Corneille's Horace. The latter is a &s;entiment of indignation merely, the former of invincible fortitude.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e examples, to cite many a &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age, enriched with the fine&s;t images, and dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t ner|vous expre&s;&s;ions, would &s;carce be fair. I &s;hall produce but one in&s;tance from Shake|&s;pear, which &s;ets a few objects before the eye, without much pomp of language. It works its effect, by repre&s;enting the&s;e ob|jects in a climax, rai&s;ing the mind higher and higher till it feel the emotion of gran|deur in perfection.
<Q><L>The cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,</L>

<HI>The cloud-capt tow'rs</HI> produce an elevating emotion, heightened by the <HI>gorgeous palaces.</HI> And the mind is carried &s;till higher and higher by the images that follow.

<P><PB N="298" REF="311">
I proceed to another ob&s;ervation. In the chapter of beauty it is remarked, that regularity is required in &s;mall figures, and order in &s;mall groups; but that in advan|cing gradually from &s;mall to great, regula|rity and order are le&s;s and le&s;s required. This remark &s;erves to explain the extreme delight we have in viewing the face of na|ture, when &s;ufficiently enriched and diver|&s;ified by objects. The bulk of the objects &s;een in a natural land&s;cape are beautiful, and &s;ome of them grand. A flowing river, a &s;preading oak, a round hill, an extended plain, are delightful; and even a rugged rock or barren heath, though in them&s;elves di&s;agreeable, contribute by contra&s;t to the beauty of the whole. Joining to the&s;e, the verdure of the fields, the mixture of light and &s;hade, and the &s;ublime canopy &s;pread over all; it will not appear wonderful, that &s;o exten&s;ive a group of glorious objects &s;hould &s;well the heart to its utmo&s;t bounds, and rai&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t emotion of grandeur. The &s;pectator is con&s;cious of an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which cannot bear confinement nor the &s;trictne&s;s of regularity and order. He loves
<PB N="299" REF="312">
to range at large; and is &s;o inchanted with &s;hining objects, as to neglect &s;light beauties or defects. Thus it is, that the delightful emotion of grandeur, depends little on order and regularity. And when the emotion is at its height by a &s;urvey of the greate&s;t ob|jects, order and regularity are almo&s;t totally di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable in &s;ome mea&s;ure to works of art. In a &s;mall building the &s;lighte&s;t irregularity is di&s;agree|able. In a magnificent palace or a large Gothic church, irregularities are le&s;s regard|ed. In an epic poem we pardon many negligences, which would be intolerable in a &s;onnet or epigram. Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch exceptions, it may be ju&s;tly laid down for a rule, That in all works of art, order and regularity ought to be governing principles. And hence the ob&s;ervation of Longinus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 30.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"In works of art we have regard to exact proportion; in tho&s;e of nature, to gran|deur and magnificence."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall add but one other ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="300" REF="313">
That no means can be more &s;ucce&s;sfully employed to &s;ink and depre&s;s the mind than grandeur or &s;ublimity. By the artful intro|duction of an humbling object, the fall is great in proportion to the former elevation. Of this doctrine Shake&s;pear affords us a beautiful illu&s;tration, in a pa&s;&s;age part of which is cited above for another purpo&s;e:
<Q><L>The cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,</L>
<L>The &s;olemn temples, the great globe it&s;elf,</L>
<L>Yea all which it inherit, &s;hall di&s;&s;olve,</L>
<L>And like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion</L>
<L>Leave not a rack behind&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>Tempe&s;t, act 4. &s;c. 4.</BIBL></Q>
The elevation of the mind in the former part of this beautiful pa&s;&s;age, makes the fall great in proportion when the mo&s;t humbling of all images is introduced, that of an utter di&s;&s;olution of the earth and its inhabitants. A &s;entiment makes not the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion in a cool &s;tate, that it does when the mind is warmed; and a depre&s;&s;ing or melancholy &s;entiment makes the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, when it brings down the mind from its highe&s;t &s;tate of elevation or chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="314">
This indirect effect of elevation to &s;ink the mind, is &s;ometimes produced without the intervention of any humbling image. There was occa&s;ion above to remark, that in de&s;cribing &s;uperior beings, the reader's imagination, unable to &s;upport it&s;elf in a &s;trained elevation, falls often as from a height, and &s;inks even below its ordinary tone. The following in&s;tance comes lucki|ly in view; for a better illu&s;tration cannot be given: <Q REND="inline">"God &s;aid, Let there be light, and there was light."</Q> Longinus cites this pa&s;&s;age from Mo&s;es as a &s;hining exam|ple of the &s;ublime; and it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible in fewer words, to convey &s;o clear an image of the infinite power of the Deity. But then it belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject to remark, that the emotion of &s;ublimity rai&s;ed by this image is but momentary; and that the mind, unable to &s;upport it&s;elf in an eleva|tion &s;o much above nature, immediate|ly &s;inks down into humility and venera|tion for a being &s;o far exalted above us groveling mortals. Every one is acquainted with a di&s;pute about this pa&s;&s;age betwixt
<PB N="302" REF="315">
two French critics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boileau and Huet.</NOTE>, the one po&s;itively affirming, the other as po&s;itively deny|ing, it to be &s;ublime. What I have o|pened, &s;hows that both of them have reached the truth, but neither of them the whole truth. Every one of ta&s;te mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the primary effect of this pa&s;|&s;age is an emotion of grandeur. This &s;o far ju&s;tifies Boileau. But then every one of ta&s;te mu&s;t be equally &s;en&s;ible, that the emo|tion is merely a fla&s;h, which vani&s;heth in|&s;tantly, and gives way to the deepe&s;t humi|lity and veneration. This indirect effect of &s;ublimity, ju&s;tifies Huet on the other hand, who being a man of true piety, and perhaps of inferior imagination, felt the humbling pa&s;&s;ions more &s;en&s;ibly than his antagoni&s;t. And even laying a&s;ide any peculiarity of character, Huet's opinion may I think be defended as the more &s;olid; upon the fol|lowing account, that in &s;uch images, the depre&s;&s;ing emotions are the more &s;en&s;ibly felt, and have the longer endurance.</P>
<P>The &s;training an elevated &s;ubject beyond

due bounds and beyond the reach of an ordinary conception, is not a vice &s;o fre|quent as to require the correction of criti|ci&s;m. But fal&s;e &s;ublime is a rock which writers of more fire than judgement gene|rally &s;plit on. And therefore a collection of examples may be of u&s;e as a beacon to fu|ture adventurers. One &s;pecies of fal&s;e &s;ub|lime, known by the name of <HI>bomba&s;t,</HI> is common among writers of a mean genius.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Motion and Force.</HEAD>
<P>THAT motion is agreeable to the eye without relation to purpo&s;e or de&s;ign, may appear from the a|mu&s;ement it gives to infants. Juvenile ex|erci&s;es are reli&s;hed chiefly upon that ac|count.</P>
<P>If to &s;ee a body in motion be agreeable, one will be apt to conclude, that to &s;ee it at re&s;t is di&s;agreeable. But we learn from experience, that this would be a ra&s;h con|clu&s;ion. Re&s;t is one of tho&s;e circum&s;tances that are neither agreeable nor di&s;agreeable. It is viewed with perfect indifferency. And happy it is for mankind that the matter is &s;o ordered. If re&s;t were agreeable, it would di&s;|incline us to motion, by which all things are performed. If it were di&s;agreeable, it would be a &s;ource of perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s; for the bulk of the things we &s;ee appear to be at
<PB N="310" REF="323">
re&s;t. A &s;imilar in&s;tance of de&s;igning wi&s;|dom I have had occa&s;ion to explain, in oppo&s;ing grandeur to littlene&s;s, and eleva|tion to lowne&s;s of place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 4.</NOTE>. Even in the &s;imple&s;t matters, the finger of God is con|&s;picuous. The happy adju&s;tment of the internal nature of man to his external circum&s;tances, di&s;played in the in&s;tances here given, is indeed admirable.</P>
<P>Motion is certainly agreeable in all its varieties of quickne&s;s and &s;lowne&s;s. But motion long continued admits &s;ome excep|tions. That degree of continued motion which corre&s;ponds to the natural cour&s;e of our perceptions, is the mo&s;t agreeable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See chap. 9.</NOTE>. The quicke&s;t motion is for an in&s;tant de|lightful. But it &s;oon appears to be too ra|pid. It becomes painful, by forcibly acce|lerating the cour&s;e of our perceptions. Slow continued motion becomes di&s;agreeable for an oppo&s;ite rea&s;on, that it retards the natu|ral cour&s;e of our perceptions.</P>
<P>There are other varieties in motion, be|&s;ide
<PB N="311" REF="324">
quickne&s;s and &s;lowne&s;s, that make it more or le&s;s agreeable. Regular motion is preferred before what is irregular, witne&s;s the motion of the planets in orbits nearly circular. The motion of the comets in or|bits le&s;s regular, is le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P>Motion uniformly accelerated, re&s;em|bling an a&s;cending &s;eries of numbers, is more agreeable than when uniformly re|tarded. Motion upward is agreeable by the elevation of the moving body. What then &s;hall we &s;ay of downward motion re|gularly accelerated by the force of gravity, compared with upward motion regularly retarded by the &s;ame force? Which of the&s;e is the mo&s;t agreeable? This que&s;tion is not ea&s;ily &s;olved.</P>
<P>Motion in a &s;traight line is no doubt a|greeable. But we prefer undulating mo|tion, as of waves, of a flame, of a &s;hip under &s;ail. Such motion is more free, and al&s;o more natural. Hence the beauty of a &s;erpentine river.</P>
<P>The ea&s;y and &s;liding motion of fluids, from the lubricity and incoherence of their parts, is agreeable upon that account. But
<PB N="312" REF="325">
the agreeablene&s;s chiefly depends upon the following circum&s;tance, that the motion is perceived, not as of one body, but as of an endle&s;s number moving together with order and regularity. Poets &s;truck with this beauty, draw more images from fluids than from &s;olids.</P>
<P>Force is of two kinds; one quie&s;cent, and one exerted by motion. The former, dead weight for example, mu&s;t be laid a|&s;ide; for a body at re&s;t is not by that cir|cum&s;tance either agreeable or di&s;agreeable. Moving force only belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and though it is not &s;eparable from motion, yet by the power of ab&s;traction, either of them may be con&s;idered independ|ent of the other Both of them are agree|able, becau&s;e both of them include activity. It is agreeable to &s;ee a thing move: to &s;ee it moved, as when it is dragged or pu&s;hed along, is neither agreeable nor di&s;agree|able, more than when at re&s;t. It is agree|able to &s;ee a thing exert force; but it makes not the thing either agreeable or di&s;agree|able, to &s;ee force exerted upon it.</P>
<P>Though motion and force are each of
<PB N="313" REF="326">
them agreeable, the impre&s;&s;ions they make are different. This difference, clearly felt, is not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. All we can &s;ay is, that the emotion rai&s;ed by a moving body, re&s;embles its cau&s;e: it feels as if the mind were carried along. The emotion rai&s;ed by force exerted, re&s;embles al&s;o its cau&s;e: it feels as if force were exerted within the mind.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this difference, I give the following examples. It has been explained why &s;moke a&s;cending in a calm day, &s;up|po&s;e from a cottage in a wood, is an agree|able object<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 1.</NOTE>. Land&s;cape-painters are fond of this object, and introduce it upon all occa&s;ions. As the a&s;cent is natural and without effort, it is delightful in a calm &s;tate of mind. It makes an impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame &s;ort with that of a gently-flowing river, but more agreeable, becau&s;e a&s;cent is more to our ta&s;te than de&s;cent. A fire|work or a <HI>jet d'eau</HI> rou&s;es the mind more; becau&s;e the beauty of force vi&s;ibly exerted, is &s;uperadded to that of upward motion.
<PB N="314" REF="327">
To a man reclining indolently upon a bank of flowers, a&s;cending &s;moke in a &s;till morning is delightful. But a fire-work or a <HI>jet d'eau</HI> rou&s;es him from this &s;upine po&s;ture, and puts him in motion.</P>
<P>A <HI>jet d'eau</HI> makes an impre&s;&s;ion di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from that of a water-fall. Down|ward motion being natural and without ef|fort, tends rather to quiet the mind than to rou&s;e it. Upward motion, on the con|trary, overcoming the re&s;i&s;tance of gravity, makes an impre&s;&s;ion of a great effort, and thereby rou&s;es and enlivens the mind.</P>
<P>The public games of the Greeks and Romans, which gave &s;o much entertain|ment to the &s;pectators, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in exerting force, wre&s;tling, leaping, throw|ing great &s;tones, and &s;uch like trials of &s;trength. When great force is exerted, the effort felt within the mind produces great life and vivacity. The effort may be &s;uch, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to overpower the mind. Thus the explo&s;ion of gun-powder, the violence of a torrent, the weight of a mountain, and the cru&s;h of an earthquake, create a&s;toni&s;hment rather than plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="328">
No quality nor circum&s;tance contributes more to grandeur than force, e&s;pecially as exerted by &s;en&s;ible beings. I cannot make this more evident than by the following ci|tations.</P>

<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider the effect of mo|tion and force in conjunction. In con|templating the planetary &s;y&s;tem, what &s;trikes us the mo&s;t, is the &s;pherical figures of the planets and their regular motions. The conception we have of their activity
<PB N="317" REF="330">
and enormous bulk is more ob&s;cure. The beauty accordingly of this &s;y&s;tem, rai&s;es a more lively emotion than its grandeur. But if we could imagine our&s;elves &s;pectators comprehending the whole &s;y&s;tem at one view, the activity and irre&s;i&s;tible force of the&s;e immen&s;e bodies would fill us with a|mazement. Nature cannot furni&s;h another &s;cene &s;o grand.</P>
<P>Motion and force, agreeable in them|&s;elves, are al&s;o agreeable by their utility when employed as means to accompli&s;h &s;ome beneficial end. Hence the &s;uperior beauty of &s;ome machines, where force and motion concur to perform the work of numberle&s;s hands. Hence the beautiful motions, firm and regular, of a hor&s;e train|ed for war. Every &s;ingle &s;tep is the fitte&s;t that can be for obtaining the end propo&s;ed. But the grace of motion is vi&s;ible chiefly in man, not only for the rea&s;ons mentioned, but al&s;o becau&s;e every ge&s;ture is &s;ignificant. The power however of agreeable motion is not a common talent. Every limb of the human body has a good and a bad, an agree|able and di&s;agreeable action. Some mo|tions
<PB N="318" REF="331">
are extremely graceful, others are plain and vulgar: &s;ome expre&s;s dignity, others meanne&s;s. But the plea&s;ure here, ari&s;ing not &s;ingly from the beauty of motion, but from indicating character and &s;entiment, belongs to a different chapter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;hould conclude with the final cau&s;e of the reli&s;h we have for motion and force, were it not &s;o evident as to require no explanation. We are placed here in &s;uch circum&s;tances as to make indu&s;try e&s;&s;ential to our well|being; for without indu&s;try the plaine&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life are not to be obtained. When our &s;ituation therefore in this world requires activity and a con&s;tant exertion of motion and force, Providence indulgently provides for our welfare in making the&s;e agreeable to us. It would be a blunder in our nature, to make things di&s;agreeable that we depend on for exi&s;tence; and even to make them indifferent, would tend to make us relax greatly from that degree of activity which is indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Novelty, and the unexpected ap|pearance of objects.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the particulars that contribute to rai&s;e emotions, not excepting beauty, or even greatne&s;s, novelty hath the mo&s;t powerful influence. A new &s;pectacle attracts multitudes. It produceth in&s;tantaneou&s;ly an emotion which totally occupies the mind, and for a time excludes all other objects. The &s;oul &s;eems to meet the &s;trange appearance with a certain elon|gation of it&s;elf; and all is hu&s;hed in clo&s;e contemplation. In &s;ome in&s;tances, there is perceived a degree of agony, attended with external &s;ymptoms extremely expre&s;&s;ive. Conver&s;ation among the vulgar never is more intere&s;ting, than when it runs upon &s;trange objects and extraordinary events. Men tear them&s;elves from their native coun|try in &s;earch of things rare and new; and
<PB N="320" REF="333">
curio&s;ity converts into a plea&s;ure, the fatigues, and even perils of travelling. To what cau&s;e &s;hall we a&s;cribe the&s;e &s;ingular appearances? The plain account of the matter follows. Curio&s;ity is implanted in human nature, for a purpo&s;e extremely beneficial, that of ac|quiring knowledge. New and &s;trange ob|jects, above all others, excite our curio&s;ity; and its gratification is the emotion above de|&s;cribed, known by the name of <HI>wonder.</HI> This emotion is di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>admira|tion.</HI> Novelty where-ever found, whether in a quality or action, is the cau&s;e of won|der: admiration is directed upon the ope|rator who performs any thing wonderful.</P>
<P>During infancy, every new object is pro|bably the occa&s;ion of wonder, in &s;ome de|gree; becau&s;e, during infancy, every ob|ject at fir&s;t is &s;trange as well as new. But as objects are rendered familiar by cu&s;tom, we cea&s;e by degrees to wonder at new ap|pearances that have any re&s;emblance to what we are acquainted with. A thing mu&s;t be &s;ingular as well as new, to excite our curio|&s;ity and to rai&s;e our wonder. To &s;ave mul|tiplying words, I would be under&s;tood to
<PB N="321" REF="334">
comprehend both circum&s;tances when I hereafter talk of novelty.</P>
<P>In an ordinary train of perceptions where one thing introduces another, not a &s;ingle object makes its appearance unexpectedly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>. The mind thus prepared for the reception of its objects, admits them one after ano|ther without perturbation. But when a thing breaks in unexpectedly and without the preparation of any connection, it rai&s;es a &s;ingular emotion known by the name of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e.</HI> This emotion may be produced by the mo&s;t familiar object, as when one accidentally meets a friend who was re|ported to be dead; or a man in high life, lately a beggar. On the other hand, a new object, however &s;trange, will not produce this emotion if the &s;pectator be prepared for the &s;ight. An elephant in India will not &s;urpri&s;e a traveller who goes to &s;ee one; and yet its novelty will rai&s;e his wonder. An Indian in Britain would be much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;tumble upon an elephant feeding at large in the open fields; but the creature

it&s;elf, to which he was accu&s;tomed, would not rai&s;e his wonder.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e thus in &s;everal re&s;pects differs from wonder. Unexpectedne&s;s is the cau&s;e of the former emotion: novelty is the cau&s;e of the latter. Nor differ they le&s;s in their nature and circum&s;tances, as will be explain|ed by and by. With relation to one circum|&s;tance they perfectly agree, which is the &s;hortne&s;s of their duration. The in&s;tanta|neous production of the&s;e emotions in per|fection, may contribute to this effect, in conformity to a general law, That things &s;oon decay which &s;oon come to perfection. The violence of the emotions may al&s;o con|tribute; for an ardent emotion, which is not &s;u&s;ceptible of increa&s;e, cannot have a long cour&s;e. But their &s;hort duration is oc|ca&s;ioned chiefly by that of their cau&s;es. We are &s;oon reconciled to an object, however un|expected; and novelty &s;oon degenerates in|to familiarity.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e emotions be plea&s;ant or painful, is not a clear point. It may appear &s;trange, that our own feelings and their ca|pital qualities &s;hould afford any matter for a
<PB N="323" REF="336">
doubt. But when we are ingro&s;&s;ed by any emotion, there is no place for &s;peculation; and when &s;ufficiently calm for &s;peculation, it is not ea&s;y to recal the emotion with &s;uffi|cient accuracy. New objects are &s;ometimes terrible, &s;ometimes delightful. The terror which a tyger in&s;pires is greate&s;t at fir&s;t, and wears off gradually by familiarity. On the other hand, even women will acknow|ledge, that it is novelty which plea&s;es the mo&s;t in a new fa&s;hion. At this rate, it &s;hould be thought, that wonder is not in it&s;elf plea&s;ant or painful, but that it a&s;&s;umes either quality according to circum&s;tances. This doctrine, however plau&s;ible, mu&s;t not pa&s;s without examination. And when we reflect upon the principle of curio&s;ity and its operations, a glimp&s;e of light gives &s;ome faint view of a different theory. Our cu|rio&s;ity is never more thoroughly gratified, than by new and &s;ingular objects. That very gratification is the emotion of wonder, which therefore, according to the analogy of nature, ought always to be plea&s;ant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>.
<PB N="324" REF="337">
And indeed it would be a great defect in human nature, were the gratification of &s;o u&s;eful a principle unplea&s;ant. But upon a more &s;trict &s;crutiny, we &s;hall not have oc|ca&s;ion to mark curio&s;ity as an exception from the general rule. A new object, it is true, that hath a threatening appearance, adds to our terror by its novelty. But from this expe|riment it doth not follow, that novelty is in it&s;elf di&s;agreeable. It is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, that we &s;hould be delighted with an object in one view, and terrified with it in another. A river in flood &s;welling over its banks, is a grand and delightful object; and yet it may produce no &s;mall degree of fear when we attempt to cro&s;s it. Courage and magnani|mity are agreeable; and yet when we view the&s;e qualities in an enemy, they &s;erve to increa&s;e our terror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 4.</NOTE>. In the &s;ame man|ner, novelty has two effects clearly di&s;tin|gui&s;hable from each other. A new object, by gratifying curio&s;ity, mu&s;t always be a|greeable. It may, at the &s;ame time, have an oppo&s;ite effect indirectly, which is, to in|&s;pire
<PB N="325" REF="338">
terror. For when a new object ap|pears in any degree dangerous, our igno|rance of its powers and qualities affords am|ple &s;cope for the imagination to dre&s;s it in the mo&s;t frightful colours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality and natural religion, part 2. e&s;&s;. 6.</NOTE>. Thus the fir&s;t &s;ight of a lion at &s;ome di&s;tance, may at the &s;ame in&s;tant produce two oppo&s;ite feelings, the plea&s;ant emotion of wonder, and the pain|ful pa&s;&s;ion of terror. The novelty of the ob|ject, produces the former directly, and con|tributes to the latter indirectly. Thus, when the &s;ubject is analized, we find, that the power which novelty hath indirectly to in|flame terror, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with its being in every ca&s;e agreeable. The matter may be put in a &s;till clearer light by varying the &s;cene. If a lion be fir&s;t &s;een from a place of &s;afety, the &s;pectacle is altogether a|greeable without the lea&s;t mixture of ter|ror. If again the fir&s;t &s;ight put us within reach of this dangerous animal, our terror may be &s;o great as quite to exclude any &s;en&s;e of novelty. But this fact proves not
<PB N="326" REF="339">
that wonder is painful: it proves only that wonder may be excluded by a more power|ful pa&s;&s;ion. And yet it is this fact, which, in &s;uperficial thinking, has thrown the &s;ub|ject into ob&s;curity. I pre&s;ume we may now boldly affirm, that wonder is in every ca&s;e a plea&s;ant emotion. This is acknowledged as to all new objects that appear inoffen&s;ive. And even as to objects that appear offen&s;ive, I urge that the &s;ame mu&s;t hold &s;o long as the &s;pectator can attend to the novelty.</P>
<P>Whether &s;urpri&s;e be in it&s;elf plea&s;ant or painful, is a que&s;tion not le&s;s intricate than the former. It is certain, that &s;urpri&s;e in|flames our joy when unexpectedly we meet with an old friend: and not le&s;s our terror, when we &s;tumble upon any thing noxious. To clear this point, we mu&s;t trace it &s;tep by &s;tep. And the fir&s;t thing to be remarked is, that in &s;ome in&s;tances an unexpected ob|ject overpowers the mind &s;o as to produce a momentary &s;tupefaction. An unexpected object, not le&s;s than one that is new, is apt to &s;ound an alarm and to rai&s;e terror. Man, naturally a defencele&s;s being, is happily &s;o con&s;tituted as to apprehend danger in all
<PB N="327" REF="340">
doubtful ca&s;es. Accordingly, where the object is dangerous, or appears &s;o, the &s;ud|den alarm it gives, without preparation, is apt totally to unhinge the mind, and for a moment to &s;u&s;pend all the faculties, even thought it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the Latin names for &s;urpri&s;e, <HI>torpor, animi &s;tupor.</HI></NOTE>. In this &s;tate a man is quite helple&s;s; and if he move at all, is as likely to run upon the danger as from it. Sur|pri&s;e carried to this height, cannot be either plea&s;ant or painful; becau&s;e the mind, du|ring &s;uch momentary &s;tupefaction, is in a good mea&s;ure, if not totally, in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>If we then inquire for the character of this emotion, it mu&s;t be where the unex|pected object or event produceth le&s;s violent effects. And while the mind remains &s;en|&s;ible of plea&s;ure and pain, is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;urpri&s;e, like wonder, &s;hould have an invariable character? I am incli|ned however to think, that &s;urpri&s;e has no invariable character, but a&s;&s;umes that of the object which rai&s;es it. Wonder is the gra|tification of a natural principle, and upon
<PB N="328" REF="341">
that account mu&s;t be plea&s;ant. There, no|velty is the capital circum&s;tance, which, for a time, is intitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind entire|ly in one unvaried tone. The unexpected appearance of an object, &s;eems not equally intitled to produce an emotion di&s;tingui&s;h|able from the emotion, plea&s;ant or painful, that is produced by the object in its ordina|ry appearance. It ought not naturally to have any effect, other than to &s;well that e|motion, by making it more plea&s;ant or more painful than it commonly is. And this con|jecture is confirmed by experience, as well as by language, which is built upon expe|rience. When a man meets a friend un|expectedly, he is &s;aid to be agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed; and when he meets an enemy un|expectedly, he is &s;aid to be di&s;agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed. It appears then, that the &s;ole ef|fect of &s;urpri&s;e is to &s;well the emotion rai&s;ed by the object. And this effect can be clear|ly explained. A tide of connected percep|tions, glides gently into the mind, and pro|duceth no perturbation. An object on the other hand breaking in unexpectedly, &s;ounds an alarm, rou&s;es the mind out of its calm
<PB N="329" REF="342">
&s;tate, and directs its whole attention upon the object, which, if agreeable, becomes doubly &s;o. Several circum&s;tances concur to produce this effect. On the one hand, the agitation of the mind and its keen atten|tion, prepare it in the mo&s;t effectual man|ner for receiving a deep impre&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, the object by its &s;udden and unfore&s;een appearance, makes an im|pre&s;&s;ion, not gradually as expected objects do, but as at one &s;troke with its whole force. The circum&s;tances are preci&s;ely &s;imilar, where the object is in it&s;elf di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of novelty is ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that of variety. To produce the latter, a plurality of objects is nece&s;&s;ary. The former ari&s;es from a circum&s;tance found in a &s;ingle object. Again, where objects, whether coexi&s;tent or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are &s;ufficiently diver&s;ified, the plea&s;ure of variety is complete, though every &s;ingle ob|ject of the train be familiar. But the plea|&s;ure of novelty, directly oppo&s;ite to familia|rity, requires no diver&s;ification.</P>
<P>There are different degrees of novelty, and its effects are in proportion. The low|e&s;t
<PB N="330" REF="343">
degree is found in objects that are &s;urvey|ed a &s;econd time after a long interval. That in this ca&s;e an object takes on &s;ome appear|ance of novelty, is certain from experience. A large building of many parts variou&s;ly ad|orned, or an exten&s;ive field embelli&s;hed with trees, lakes, temples, &s;tatues, and other ornaments, will appear new oftener than once. The memory of an object &s;o com|plex is &s;oon lo&s;t; of its parts at lea&s;t, or of their arrangement. But experience teaches, that even without any decay of remembrance, ab&s;ence alone will give an air of novelty to a once familiar object; which is not &s;urpri|&s;ing, becau&s;e familiarity wears off gradually by ab&s;ence. Thus a per&s;on with whom we have been intimate, returning after a long interval, appears like a new acquaint|ance. Di&s;tance of place contributes to this appearance, not le&s;s than di&s;tance of time. A friend after a &s;hort ab&s;ence in a remote country, has the &s;ame air of novelty as if he had returned after a longer interval from a place nearer home. The mind forms a con|nection betwixt him and the remote coun|try, and be&s;tows upon him the &s;ingularity
<PB N="331" REF="344">
of the objects he has &s;een. When two things equally new and &s;ingular are pre&s;ent|ed, the &s;pectator balances betwixt them. But when told that one of them is the pro|duct of a di&s;tant quarter of the world, he no longer he&s;itates, but clings to this as the more &s;ingular. Hence the preference gi|ven to foreign luxuries and to foreign curio|&s;ities, which appear rare in proportion to their original di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The next degree of novelty, mounting upward, is found in objects of which we have &s;ome information at &s;econd hand. For de&s;cription, though it contribute to familiarity, cannot altogether remove the appearance of novelty when the object it&s;elf is pre&s;ented. The fir&s;t &s;ight of a lion oc|ca&s;ions &s;ome wonder, after a thorough ac|quaintance with the correcte&s;t pictures or &s;tatues of that animal.</P>
<P>A new object that bears &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance to a known &s;pecies, is an in|&s;tance of a third degree of novelty. A &s;trong re&s;emblance among individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, prevents almo&s;t entirely the effect of novelty; unle&s;s di&s;tance of
<PB N="332" REF="345">
place or &s;ome other circum&s;tance concur. But where the re&s;emblance is faint, &s;ome degree of wonder is felt; and the emotion ri&s;es in proportion to the faintne&s;s of the re|&s;emblance.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t degree of wonder ari&s;eth from unknown objects that have no ana|logy to any &s;pecies we are acquainted with. Shake&s;pear in a &s;imile introduces this &s;pecies of novelty.<Q><L>As glorious to the &s;ight</L>
<L>As is a winged me&s;&s;enger from heaven</L>
<L>Unto the white upturned wondring eye</L>
<L>Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him</L>
<L>When he be&s;trides the lazy-pacing clouds,</L>
<L>And &s;ails upon the bo&s;om of the air.</L>
<BIBL>Romeo and Juliet.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>One example of this &s;pecies of novelty de&s;erves peculiar attention; and that is, when an object altogether new is &s;een by one per&s;on only, and but for once. The&s;e circum&s;tances heighten remarkably the e|motion. The &s;ingularity of the condition of the &s;pectator concurs with the &s;ingularity
<PB N="333" REF="346">
of the object, to inflame wonder to its highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>In explaining the effects of novelty, the place a being occupies in the &s;cale of exi&s;t|ence, is a circum&s;tance that mu&s;t not be omitted. Novelty in the individuals of a low cla&s;s, is perceived with indifference, or with a very &s;light emotion. Thus a pebble, however &s;ingular in its appearance, &s;carce moves our wonder. The emotion ri&s;es with the rank of the object; and, other circum&s;tances being equal, is &s;tronge&s;t in the highe&s;t order of exi&s;tence. A &s;trange animal affects us more than a &s;trange vege|table; and were we admitted to view &s;uperior beings, our wonder would ri&s;e proportionably; and accompanying Nature in her amazing works, be completed in the contemplation of the Deity.</P>
<P>However natural the love of novelty may be, it is a matter of experience, that tho&s;e who reli&s;h novelty the mo&s;t, are careful to conceal its influence. This reli&s;h, it is true, prevails in children, in idle people, and in men of a weak mind. And yet, after all, why &s;hould one be a&s;hamed for indulging
<PB N="334" REF="347">
a natural propen&s;ity? A di&s;tinction will ex|plain this difficulty. No man is a&s;hamed to own, that he loves to contemplate new or &s;trange objects. He neither condemns him&s;elf nor is cen&s;ured by others, for this appetite. But every man &s;tudies to conceal, that he loves a thing or performs an action, merely for its novelty. The rea&s;on of the difference will &s;et the matter in a clear light. Curio&s;ity is a natural principle di|rected upon new and &s;ingular objects, in the contemplation of which its gratification con&s;i&s;ts, without leading to any end other than knowledge. The man therefore who prefers any thing merely becau&s;e it is new, hath not this principle for his ju&s;tification; nor indeed any good principle. Vanity is at the bottom, which ea&s;ily prevails upon tho&s;e who have no ta&s;te, to prefer things odd, rare, or &s;ingular, in order to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves from others. And in fact, the appetite for novelty, as above mentioned, reigns chiefly among per&s;ons of a mean ta&s;te, who are ignorant of refined and elegant plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The gratification of curio&s;ity, as men|tioned
<PB N="335" REF="348">
above, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a proper name, <HI>viz. wonder</HI>; an honour denied to the gratification of any other principle, e|motion, or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as I can recollect. This &s;ingularity indicates &s;ome important final cau&s;e, which I endeavour to unfold. An acquaintance with the various things that may affect us, and with their properties, is e&s;&s;ential to our well-being. Nor will a &s;light or &s;uperficial acquaintance be &s;uffi|cient. It ought to be &s;o deeply ingraved on the mind, as to be ready for u&s;e upon every occa&s;ion. Now, in order to a deep impre&s;&s;ion, it is wi&s;ely contrived, that things &s;hould be introduced to our acquaintance, with a certain pomp and &s;olemnity produc|tive of a vivid emotion. When the impre&s;|&s;ion is once fairly made, the emotion of novelty, being no longer nece&s;&s;ary, vani&s;h|eth almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; never to return, unle&s;s where the impre&s;&s;ion happens to be obliterated by length of time or other means; in which ca&s;e the &s;econd introduc|tion is nearly as &s;olemn as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>De&s;igning wi&s;dom is no where more le|gible than in this part of the human frame.
<PB N="336" REF="349">
If new objects did not affect us in a very peculiar manner, their impre&s;&s;ions would be &s;o &s;light as &s;carce to be of any u&s;e in life. On the other hand, did objects continue to affect us as deeply as at fir&s;t, the mind would be totally ingro&s;&s;ed with them, and have no room left either for action or re|flection.</P>
<P>The final cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e is &s;till more e|vident than of novelty. Self-love makes us vigilantly attentive to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But &s;elf-love, which operates by means of rea|&s;on and reflection, and impells not the mind to any particular object or from it, is a principle too cool for a &s;udden emergency. An object breaking in unexpectedly, affords no time for deliberation; and, in this ca&s;e, the agitation of &s;urpri&s;e is artfully contrived to rou&s;e &s;elf-love into action. Surpri&s;e gives the alarm, and if there be any appear|ance of danger, our whole force is in&s;tantly &s;ummoned up to &s;hun or to prevent it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Ri&s;ible Objects.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the nature of man, that his powers and faculties are &s;oon blunted by exerci&s;e. The returns of &s;leep, &s;u&s;pending all activity, are not alone &s;uffi|cient to pre&s;erve him in vigor. During his waking hours, amu&s;ement by intervals is requi&s;ite to unbend his mind from &s;erious occupation. The imagination, of all our faculties the mo&s;t active, and not always at re&s;t even in &s;leep, contributes more than any other cau&s;e to recruit the mind and re|&s;tore its vigor, by amu&s;ing us with gay and ludicrous images; and when relaxation is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch amu&s;ement is much reli&s;h|ed. But there are other &s;ources of amu&s;e|ment be&s;ide the imagination. Many ob|jects, natural as well as artificial, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet of <HI>ri&s;ible,</HI> be|cau&s;e they rai&s;e in us a peculiar emotion ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="338" REF="351">
externally by <HI>laughter.</HI> This is a plea&s;ant emotion; and being al&s;o mirthful, it mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully unbends the mind and recruits the &s;pirits.</P>
<P><HI>Ludicrous</HI> is a general term, &s;ignifying, as we may conjecture from its derivation, what is play&s;ome, &s;portive, or jocular. <HI>Lu|dicrous</HI> therefore &s;eems the genus, of which <HI>ri&s;ible</HI> is a &s;pecies, limited as above to what makes us laugh.</P>
<P>However ea&s;y it may be, concerning any particular object, to &s;ay whether it be ri&s;ible or not; it &s;eems difficult, if at all practi|cable, to e&s;tabli&s;h beforehand any general character by which objects of this kind may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from others. Nor is this a &s;ingular ca&s;e. Upon a review, we find the &s;ame difficulty in mo&s;t of the articles already handled. There is nothing more ea&s;y, viewing a particular object, than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly, grand or little: but were we to attempt general rules for ranging objects under different cla&s;&s;es, according to the&s;e qualities, we &s;hould find our&s;elves utterly at a lo&s;s. There is a &s;eparate cau&s;e which increa&s;es the diffi|culty
<PB N="339" REF="352">
of di&s;tingui&s;hing ri&s;ible objects by a general character. All men are not equally affected by ri&s;ible objects; and even the &s;ame per&s;on is more di&s;po&s;ed to laugh at one time than another. In high &s;pirits a thing will make us laugh outright, that will &s;carce provoke a &s;mile when we are in a grave mood. We mu&s;t therefore abandon the thought of attempting general rules for di&s;tingui&s;hing ri&s;ible objects from others. Ri&s;ible objects however are circum&s;cribed within certain limits, which I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, without pretending to any degree of accu|racy. And, in the fir&s;t place, I ob&s;erve, that no object is ri&s;ible but what appears &s;light, little, or trifling. For man is &s;o con&s;tituted as to be &s;eriou&s;ly affected with every thing that is of importance to his own intere&s;t or to that of others. Secondly, with re&s;pect to the works both of nature and of art, nothing is ri&s;ible but what de|viates from the common nature of the &s;ub|ject: it mu&s;t be &s;ome particular out of rule, &s;ome remarkable defect or exce&s;s, a very long vi&s;age, for example, or a very &s;hort one. Hence nothing ju&s;t, proper, decent,
<PB N="340" REF="353">
beautiful, proportioned, or grand, is ri&s;ible. A real di&s;tre&s;s rai&s;es pity, and therefore cannot be ri&s;ible. But a &s;light or imaginary di&s;tre&s;s, which moves not pity, is ri&s;ible. The adventure of the fulling-mills in Don Quixote is extremely ri&s;ible; &s;o is the &s;cene where Sancho, in a dark night, tumbles in|to a pit, and attaches him&s;elf to the &s;ide by hand and foot, there hanging in terrible di&s;may till the morning, when he di&s;covers him&s;elf to be within a foot of the bottom. A no&s;e remarkably long or &s;hort is ri&s;ible; but to want the no&s;e altogether, far from provo|king laughter, rai&s;es horror in the &s;pecta|tor.</P>
<P>From what is &s;aid, it will readily be con|jectured, that the emotion rai&s;ed by a ri&s;ible object is of a nature &s;o &s;ingular as &s;carce to find place while the mind is occupied with any other pa&s;&s;ion or emotion. And this conjecture is verified by experience. We &s;carce ever find this emotion blended with any other. One emotion I mu&s;t except, and that is contempt rai&s;ed by &s;ome &s;ort of improprieties. Every improper act in&s;pires us with &s;ome degree of contempt for the
<PB N="341" REF="354">
author. And if an improper act be at the &s;ame time ri&s;ible and provoke laughter, of which blunders and ab&s;urdities are noted in&s;tances, the two emotions of contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind, and produce externally what is termed <HI>a laugh of deri&s;ion</HI> or <HI>of &s;corn.</HI> Hence objects that cau&s;e laughter, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed in|to two kinds. They are either <HI>ri&s;ible</HI> or <HI>ri|diculous.</HI> A ri&s;ible object is mirthful only; a ridiculous object is both mirthful and con|temptible. The fir&s;t rai&s;es an emotion of laughter that is altogether plea&s;ant: the e|motion of laughter rai&s;ed by the other, is qualified with that of contempt; and the mixed emotion, partly plea&s;ant partly pain|ful, is termed <HI>the emotion of ridicule.</HI> I a|venge my&s;elf of the pain a ridiculous object gives me by a laugh of deri&s;ion. A ri&s;ible object, on the other hand, gives me no pain: it is altogether plea&s;ant by a certain &s;ort of titillation, which is expre&s;&s;ed externally by mirthful laughter. Ridicule will be more fully explained afterward: the pre&s;ent chap|ter is appropriated to the other emotion.</P>
<P>Ri&s;ible objects are &s;o common and &s;o well

<P>Nay, you &s;hall hear, Ma&s;ter Brook, what I have &s;uffer'd to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm'd in the ba&s;|ket, a couple of Ford's knaves, his hinds, were call'd forth by their mi&s;tre&s;s, to carry me in the name of foul cloaths to Datchet-lane. They took me on their &s;houlders, met the jealous knave their ma&s;ter in the door, who a&s;k'd them once or twice what they had in their ba&s;ket. I quak'd for fear, le&s;t the lunatic knave would have &s;earch'd it; but Fate, ordaining he &s;hould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a &s;earch, and away went I for foul cloaths. But mark the &s;equel, Ma|&s;ter Brook. I &s;uffer'd the pangs of three egregious deaths: fir&s;t, an intolerable fright, to be detected by a jealous rotten bell-weather; next, to be com|pa&s;s'd like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be &s;topt in, like a &s;trong di&s;tillation, with &s;tinking cloaths that fretted in their own grea&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Re&s;emblance and Contra&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed tho&s;e qualities and circum&s;tances of &s;ingle objects that &s;eem peculiarly connected with cri|tici&s;m, we proceed, according to the me|thod propo&s;ed in the chapter of beauty, to the relations of objects, beginning with the relations of re&s;emblance and contra&s;t.</P>
<P>Man being unavoidably connected with the beings around him, &s;ome acquaintance with their nature, their powers, and their qualities, is requi&s;ite for regulating his con|duct. As an incentive to acquire a branch of knowledge &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our well-being, motives alone of rea&s;on and intere&s;t are not &s;ufficient. Nature hath providently &s;uper|added curio&s;ity, a vigorous propen&s;ity which never is at re&s;t. It is this propen&s;ity which attaches us to every new object<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 6.</NOTE>; and in
<PB N="346" REF="359">
particular incites us to con&s;ider objects in the way of compari&s;on, in order to di&s;cover their differences and re&s;emblances.</P>
<P>Re&s;emblance among objects of the &s;ame kind, and di&s;&s;imilitude among objects of different kinds, are too obvious and familiar to gratify our curio&s;ity in any degree. The gratification lies in di&s;covering differences among things where re&s;emblance prevails, and in di&s;covering re&s;emblances where dif|ference prevails. Thus a difference in in|dividuals of the &s;ame kind of plants or ani|mals is deemed a di&s;covery, while the many particulars in which they agree are neglect|ed: and in different kinds, any re&s;emblance is greedily remarked, without attending to the many particulars in which they differ.</P>
<P>A compari&s;on however may be too far &s;tretched. When differences or re&s;emblan|ces are carried beyond certain bounds, they appear &s;light and trivial; and for that rea|&s;on will not be reli&s;hed by one of ta&s;te. Yet &s;uch propen&s;ity is there to gratify pa&s;&s;ion, curio&s;ity in particular, that even among good writers, we find many compari&s;ons too &s;light to afford &s;atisfaction. Hence the frequent
<PB N="347" REF="360">
in&s;tances among logicians, of di&s;tinctions without any &s;olid difference: and hence the frequent in&s;tances among poets and orators, of &s;imiles without any ju&s;t re&s;emblance. With regard to the latter, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one in&s;tance, which will probably amu&s;e the reader, being a citation not from a poet nor orator, but from a grave author writing an in&s;titute of law. <Q REND="inline">"Our &s;tudent &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the knowledge of the law is like a deep well, out of which each man draweth according to the &s;trength of his under&s;tanding.

Alexander, God knows, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his di&s;plea&s;ures, and his indignations, and al&s;o being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his pe&s;t friend Clytus.</P>

<P>In&s;truction, no doubt, is the chief end of compari&s;on, but not the only end. In works addre&s;&s;ed to the imagination, compa|ri&s;on may be employed with great &s;ucce&s;s to put a &s;ubject in a &s;trong point of view. A lively idea is formed of a man's courage, by likening it to that of a lion; and eloquence is exalted in our imagination, by comparing it to a river overflowing its banks, and in|volving all in its impetuous cour&s;e. The &s;ame effect is produced by contra&s;t. A man in pro&s;perity, becomes more &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="350" REF="363">
of his happine&s;s, by oppo&s;ing his condition to that of a per&s;on in want of bread. Thus compari&s;on is &s;ub&s;ervient to poetry as well as to philo&s;ophy; and with re&s;pect to both, the foregoing ob&s;ervation holds equally, that re&s;emblance among ob|jects of the &s;ame kind, and contra&s;t among objects of different kinds, have no effect. Such a compari&s;on neither tends to gratify our curio&s;ity, nor to &s;et the objects compa|red in a &s;tronger light. Two apartments in a palace, &s;imilar in &s;hape, &s;ize, and fur|niture, make &s;eparately as good a figure as when compared; and the &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to two &s;imilar copartments in a garden. On the other hand, oppo&s;e a re|gular building to a fall of water, or a good picture to a towering hill, or even a little dog to a large hor&s;e, and the contra&s;t will produce no effect. But re&s;emblance, where the objects compared are of different kinds, and contra&s;t where the objects compared are of the &s;ame kind, have each of them re|markably an enlivening effect. The poets, &s;uch of them as have a ju&s;t ta&s;te, draw all their &s;imiles from things that in the main
<PB N="351" REF="364">
differ widely from the principal &s;ubject; and they never attempt a contra&s;t but where the things have a common genus and a re|&s;emblance in the capital circum&s;tances. Place together a large and a &s;mall &s;ized a|nimal of the &s;ame &s;pecies, the one will ap|pear greater the other le&s;s, than when view|ed &s;eparately. When we oppo&s;e beauty to deformity, each makes a greater figure by the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;ubject not only in it&s;elf curious, but of great importance in all the fine arts, I mu&s;t be more particular. That re&s;emblance and contra&s;t have an enlivening effect upon objects of &s;ight, is made &s;ufficiently evident; and that they have the &s;ame effect upon ob|jects of the other &s;en&s;es, will appear from induction. Nor is this law confined to the external &s;en&s;es. Characters contra&s;ted, make a greater figure by the oppo&s;ition. Iago, in the tragedy of <HI>Othello,</HI> &s;ays

Pa&s;&s;ions and emotions are al&s;o inflamed by compari&s;on. A man of high rank humbles the by&s;tanders &s;o far as almo&s;t to annihilate them in their own opinion. Cae|&s;ar, beholding the &s;tatue of Alexander, felt a great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, when he re|flected, that now at the age of thirty-two, when Alexander died, he had not perform|ed one memorable action.</P>
<P>Our opinions al&s;o are much influenced by compari&s;on. A man who&s;e opulence exceeds the ordinary &s;tandard, is reputed richer than he is in reality; and the cha|racter of wi&s;dom or weakne&s;s, if at all re|markable,
<PB N="354" REF="367">
is generally carried beyond the truth.</P>
<P>The opinion a man forms of his pre&s;ent condition as to happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, de|pends in a great mea&s;ure on the compari&s;on he makes betwixt it and his former condi|tion:
<Q><L>Could I forget</L>
<L>What I have been, I might the better bear</L>
<L>What I am de&s;tin'd to. I'm not the fir&s;t</L>

The di&s;tre&s;s of a long journey makes even an indifferent inn pa&s;s current. And in travelling, when the road is good and the hor&s;eman well covered, a bad day may be agreeable, by making him &s;en&s;ible how &s;nug he is.</P>
<P>The &s;ame effect is equally remarkable, when a man &s;ets his condition in oppo&s;ition to that of others. A &s;hip to&s;&s;ed about in a &s;torm, makes the &s;pectator reflect upon his own &s;ecurity and ea&s;e, and puts the&s;e in the &s;tronge&s;t light:

The appearance of danger gives &s;ometimes plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes pain.

<PB N="358" REF="371">
depends upon the power of pa&s;&s;ion to mo|del our opinion of objects for its gratifica|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 5.</NOTE>. We have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee ma|ny illu&s;trious examples of this &s;ingular power of pa&s;&s;ion; and the pre&s;ent &s;ubject affords an additional in&s;tance. That this is the cau&s;e, will evidently appear, by reflect|ing in what manner a &s;pectator is affected, when a very large animal is for the fir&s;t time placed be&s;ide a very &s;mall one of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The oppo&s;ition is the fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes the mind: the unu&s;ual appearance gives &s;urpri&s;e; and the &s;pectator, prone to gratify this emotion, conceives the oppo&s;ition to be the greate&s;t that can be. He &s;ees, or &s;eems to &s;ee, the one animal extremely little, and the other extremely large. The emotion of &s;urpri&s;e ari&s;ing from any unu&s;ual re&s;emblance, &s;erves e|qually to explain why at fir&s;t view we are apt to think &s;uch re&s;emblance more entire than it is in reality. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;er|ved, that the circum&s;tances of more and le&s;s, which are the proper &s;ubjects of com|pari&s;on,
<PB N="359" REF="372">
rai&s;e a perception &s;o indi&s;tinct and vague as to facilitate the effect de&s;cribed. We have no mental &s;tandard of great and little, nor of the &s;everal degrees of any at|tribute; and the mind thus unre&s;trained, is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to indulge its &s;urpri&s;e to the utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>In exploring the operations of the mind, &s;ome of which are extremely nice and &s;lip|pery, it is nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with the ut|mo&s;t circum&s;pection. And after all, &s;el|dom it happens that &s;peculations of this kind afford any &s;trong conviction. Luckily, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we have at hand facts and experiments that &s;upport the foregoing theo|ry in a &s;atisfactory manner. In the fir&s;t place, the oppo&s;ing a &s;mall object of one &s;pecies to a great object of another, produ|ces not, in any degree, that effect of con|tra&s;t, which is &s;o remarkable when both ob|jects are of the &s;ame &s;pecies. There is no difference betwixt the&s;e two ca&s;es that pro|mi&s;eth to have any influence, but only that the former is common, the latter rare. May we not then fairly conclude, that &s;urpri&s;e from the rarity of appearance is the cau&s;e
<PB N="360" REF="373">
of contra&s;t, when we find no &s;uch effect where the appearance is common? In the next place, if &s;urpri&s;e be the &s;ole cau&s;e of the effects that appear in making a compa|ri&s;on, it follows nece&s;&s;arily that the&s;e effects will vani&s;h &s;o &s;oon as a compari&s;on becomes familiar. This holds &s;o unerringly, as to leave no rea&s;onable doubt that &s;urpri&s;e is the prime mover in this operation. Our &s;ur|pri&s;e is great the fir&s;t time a &s;mall lapdog is &s;een with a large ma&s;tiff: but when two &s;uch animals are con&s;tantly together, there is no &s;urpri&s;e; and it makes no difference whether they be viewed &s;eparately or in company. We put no bounds to the riches of a man who has recently made his for|tune. The oppo&s;ition betwixt his pre&s;ent and pa&s;t &s;ituation, or betwixt his pre&s;ent &s;ituation and that of others, is carried to an extreme. With regard to a family that for many generations hath enjoyed great wealth, the &s;ame fal&s;e reckoning is not made. It is equally remarkable, that a &s;imile lo&s;es its effect by repetition. A lover compared to a moth &s;corching it&s;elf at the flame of a can|dle, is a &s;prightly &s;imile, which by fre|quent

<P>To explain the influence of compari&s;on upon the mind, I have cho&s;en the &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e, that of two animals of the &s;ame kind, differing in &s;ize only, &s;een for the fir&s;t time. To complete the theory, other circum&s;tan|ces mu&s;t be taken in. And the next &s;uppo|&s;ition I &s;hall make, is where both animals, &s;eparately familiar to the &s;pectator, are brought together for the fir&s;t time. In this ca&s;e, the effect of magnifying and dimini&s;h|ing, will be found remarkably greater than in that fir&s;t mentioned. And the rea&s;on will appear upon analyzing the operation. The fir&s;t thing we feel is &s;urpri&s;e, occa&s;ion|ed by the uncommon difference of two creatures of the &s;ame &s;pecies. We are next &s;en&s;ible, that the one appears le&s;s, the other larger, than they did formerly. This new circum&s;tance is a &s;econd cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e,
<PB N="362" REF="375">
and augments it &s;o as to make us imagine a &s;till greater oppo&s;ition betwixt the animals, than if we had formed no notion of them beforehand.</P>
<P>I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one other &s;uppo|&s;ition, That the &s;pectator was acquainted be|forehand with one of the animals only, the lapdog for example. This new circum|&s;tance will vary the effect. In&s;tead of widening the natural difference by enlarging in appearance the one animal and dimini&s;h|ing the other in proportion, the whole ap|parent alteration will re&s;t upon the lapdog. The &s;urpri&s;e to find it le&s;s than judged to be formerly, will draw the whole attention of the mind upon it; and this &s;urpri&s;e will be gratified, by conceiving it to be of the mo&s;t diminutive &s;ize po&s;&s;ible. The ma&s;tiff in the mean time is quite neglected. I am able to illu&s;trate this effect by a very familiar exam|ple. Take a piece of paper or linen rec|koned to be a good white, and compare it with &s;omething of the &s;ame kind that is a pure white. The judgement we formed of the fir&s;t object is in&s;tantly varied; and the &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by finding it not &s;o
<PB N="363" REF="376">
white as was thought, produceth a ha&s;ty conviction that it is much le&s;s white than it is in reality. Withdrawing now the pure white, and putting in its place a deep black, the &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by this new circum|&s;tance carries our thought to the other ex|treme, and we now conceive the original ob|ject to be a pure white. Thus experience forces us to acknowledge, that our emotions have an influence even upon our eye-&s;ight. This experiment leads to a general ob&s;erva|tion, That whatever is found more &s;trange or beautiful than was expected, is judged to be more &s;trange or beautiful than it is in rea|lity. Hence it is a common artifice, to de|preciate beforehand what we wi&s;h to make a figure in the eyes of others.</P>
<P>The compari&s;ons employed by poets and orators, coincide with the la&s;t-mentioned &s;uppo&s;ition. It is always a known object that is to be aggrandized or le&s;&s;ened. The former is effectuated by likening it to &s;ome grand object, or by contra&s;ting it with one that has the oppo&s;ite character. To effec|tuate the latter, the method mu&s;t be rever|&s;ed. The object mu&s;t be contra&s;ted with
<PB N="364" REF="377">
&s;omething &s;uperior to it&s;elf, or likened to &s;omething inferior. The whole effect is produced upon the principal &s;ubject, which by this means is elevated above its rank or depre&s;&s;ed below it.</P>
<P>In accounting for the effect that any un|u&s;ual re&s;emblance or contra&s;t has upon the mind, I have hitherto a&s;&s;igned no other cau&s;e but &s;urpri&s;e; and to prevent confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity, I thought it proper to di&s;cu&s;s that principle fir&s;t. But &s;urpri&s;e is not the only cau&s;e of the effect de&s;cribed. Another cau&s;e concurs, which operates perhaps not le&s;s powerfully than &s;urpri&s;e. This cau&s;e is a principle in human nature that lies &s;till in ob&s;curity, not having been evolved by any writer, though its effects are exten&s;ive. As it is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by a proper name, the reader mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the following de&s;cription. No man who &s;tudies him&s;elf or others but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of a tendency or propen&s;ity in the mind to complete every work that is begun, and to carry things to their full perfection. This principle has lit|tle opportunity to di&s;play it&s;elf upon natural operations, which are &s;eldom left imperfect.
<PB N="365" REF="378">
But in the operations of art it hath great &s;cope; and di&s;plays it&s;elf remarkably, by making us per&s;evere in our own work, and by making us wi&s;h for the completion of what is done by another. We feel a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure when the work is brought to per|fection; and our pain is not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible when we are di&s;appointed. Hence our un|ea&s;ine&s;s, when an intere&s;ting &s;tory is broke off in the middle, when a piece of mu&s;ic ends without a clo&s;e, or when a building or garden is left imperfect. The &s;ame princi|ple operates in making collections, &s;uch as the whole works good and bad of any au|thor. A certain per&s;on endeavoured to col|lect prints of all the capital paintings, and &s;ucceeded except as to a few. La Bruyere remarks, that an anxious &s;earch was made for the&s;e, not on account of their value, but to complete the &s;et<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The examples above given are of &s;ubjects that can be brought to an end or conclu&s;ion. But the &s;ame unea&s;ine&s;s is perceptible with re&s;pect to &s;ubjects that admit not any conclu|&s;ion; witne&s;s a &s;eries that has no end, commonly called <HI>an in|finite &s;eries.</HI> The mind running along &s;uch a &s;eries, begins &s;oon to feel an unea&s;ine&s;s, which becomes more and more &s;en|&s;ible in continuing its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>An unbounded pro&s;pect doth not long continue agreeable. We &s;oon feel a &s;light unea&s;ine&s;s, which increa&s;es with the time we be&s;tow upon the object. In order to find the cau&s;e of this unea&s;ine&s;s, we fir&s;t take under con&s;ideration an avenue without a terminating object. Can a pro&s;pect without any ter|mination be compared to an infinite &s;eries? There is one &s;tri|king difference, that with re&s;pect to the eye no pro&s;pect can be unbounded. The quicke&s;t eye commands but a certain length of &s;pace; and there it is bounded, however ob&s;curely. But the mind perceives things as they exi&s;t; and the line is carried on in idea without end. In that re&s;pect an unbounded pro&s;pect is &s;imilar to an infinite &s;eries. In fact, the unea&s;i|ne&s;s of an unbounded pro&s;pect differs very little in its feeling from that of an infinite &s;eries; and therefore we may rea&s;on|ably conclude that both proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We next con&s;ider a pro&s;pect unbounded every way, as for example, a great plain, or the ocean, viewed from an eminence. We feel here an unea&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned by the want of an end or termination, preci&s;ely as in the other ca&s;es. A pro&s;pect unbounded every way is indeed &s;o far &s;ingular, as at fir&s;t to be more plea&s;ant than a pro&s;pect that is unbounded in one direction only, and afterward to be more painful. But the&s;e circum|&s;tances are ea&s;ily explained without breaking in upon the gene|ral theory. The plea&s;ure we feel at fir&s;t is a &s;trong emotion of grandeur, ari&s;ing from the immen&s;e exten&s;ion of the object. And to increa&s;e the pain we feel afterward for the want of a termination, there concurs a pain of a different kind, occa&s;ion|ed by &s;tretching the eye to comprehend &s;o great a pro&s;pect; a pain that gradually increa&s;es with the repeated efforts we make to gra&s;p the whole.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame principle, if I mi&s;take not, which operates imperceptibly with re&s;pect to quantity and number. Another's property indented into my field gives me unea&s;ine&s;s; and I am eager to make the purcha&s;e, not for profit, but in order to &s;quare my field. Xerxes and his army in their pa&s;&s;age to Greece were &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by Pythius the Lydian. Xerxes get|ting a particular account of his riches, recompen&s;ed him with 7000 Darics, which he wanted to complete the &s;um of four millions.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="379">
The final cau&s;e of this principle is an ad|ditional proof of its exi&s;tence. Human works are of no &s;ignificancy till they be completed. Rea&s;on is not always a &s;uffi|cient counterbalance to indolence: and &s;ome principle over and above is nece&s;&s;ary, to ex|cite our indu&s;try, and to prevent our &s;top|ping &s;hort in the middle of the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We need not lo&s;e time in de&s;cribing the co-operation of the foregoing principle with
<PB N="367" REF="380">
&s;urpri&s;e in producing the effect that is felt upon the appearance of any unu&s;ual re&s;em|blance or contra&s;t. Surpri&s;e fir&s;t operates, and carries our opinion of the re&s;emblance or contra&s;t beyond the truth. The principle we have been de&s;cribing carries us &s;till farther; for being bent upon gratification, it forces up|on the mind a conviction that the re&s;emblance or contra&s;t is complete. We need no better illu&s;tration than the re&s;emblance that is fan|cied
<PB N="368" REF="381">
in &s;ome pebbles to a tree or an in&s;ect. The re&s;emblance, however faint in reality, is conceived to be wonderfully perfect. This tendency to complete a re&s;emblance acting jointly with &s;urpri&s;e, carries the mind &s;ome|times &s;o far as even to pre&s;ume upon future events. In the Greek tragedy, intitled, <HI>Phineides,</HI> tho&s;e unhappy women, &s;eeing the place where it was intended they &s;hould be &s;lain, cried out with angui&s;h, <Q REND="inline">"They now &s;aw their cruel de&s;tiny had condemned them to die in that place, being the &s;ame where they had been expo&s;ed in their infancy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, poet. cap. 17.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>This remarkable principle which inclines us to advance every thing to its perfection, not only co-operates with &s;urpri&s;e to deceive the mind, but of it&s;elf is able to produce that effect. Of this we &s;ee many in&s;tances where there is no place for &s;urpri&s;e. The fir&s;t in&s;tance I &s;hall give is of re&s;emblance. <HI>Unumquodque eodem modo di&s;&s;olvitur quo colli|gatum e&s;t,</HI> is a maxim in the Roman law that has no foundation in truth. For tying and
<PB N="369" REF="382">
loo&s;ing, building and demoli&s;hing, are acts oppo&s;ite to each other, and are performed by oppo&s;ite means. But when the&s;e acts are connected by their relation to the &s;ame &s;ubject, their connection leads us to ima|gine a &s;ort of re&s;emblance betwixt them, which the foregoing principle makes us conceive to be as complete as po&s;&s;ible. The next in&s;tance &s;hall be of contra&s;t. Addi&s;on ob&s;erves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, N^o 265.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"That the pale&s;t features look the mo&s;t agreeable in white; that a face which is overflu&s;hed appears to advantage in the deepe&s;t &s;carlet; and that a dark complexion is not a little alleviated by a black hood."</Q> The foregoing principle &s;erves to account for the&s;e appearances. To make this evident, one of the ca&s;es &s;hall &s;uf|fice. A complexion, however dark, never approaches to black. When the&s;e colours appear together, their oppo&s;ition &s;trikes us; and the propen&s;ity we have to complete the oppo&s;ition, makes the darkne&s;s of com|plexion vani&s;h out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The operation of this principle, even
<PB N="370" REF="383">
where there is no ground for &s;urpri&s;e, is not confined to opinion or conviction. So powerful is it, as to make us &s;ometimes pro|ceed to action in order to complete a re|&s;emblance or contra&s;t. If this appear ob|&s;cure, it will be made clear by the follow|ing in&s;tances. Upon what principle is the <HI>lex talionis</HI> founded other than to make the puni&s;hment re&s;emble the mi&s;chief? Rea|&s;on dictates, that there ought to be a con|formity or re&s;emblance betwixt a crime and its puni&s;hment; and the foregoing principle impells us to make the re&s;emblance as com|plete as po&s;&s;ible. Titus Livius, influenced by this principle, accounts for a certain puni&s;hment by a re&s;emblance betwixt it and the crime, far too &s;ubtile for common ap|prehen&s;ion. Speaking of Mettus Fuffetius, the Alban general, who, for treachery to the Romans, his allies, was &s;entenced to be torn to pieces by hor&s;es, he puts the following &s;peech in the mouth of Tullus Ho&s;tilius, who decreed the puni&s;hment. <Q REND="inline">"Mette Fuffeti, inquit, &s;i ip&s;e di&s;cere po&s;&s;es fi|dem ac foedera &s;ervare, vivo tibi ea di&s;ci|plina a me adhibita e&s;&s;et.

In the <HI>Electra</HI> of Sophocles, Egi&s;theus is drag|ged from the theatre into an inner room of the &s;uppo&s;ed palace, to &s;uffer death where he murdered Agamemnon.

<P>Upon the &s;ubject in general, I have two remarks to add. The fir&s;t concerns re&s;em|blance, which when too entire hath no ef|fect, however different in kind the things compared may be. This remark is applicable to works of art only; for natural objects of different kinds, have &s;carce ever an entire re|&s;emblance. Marble is a &s;ort of matter, very different from what compo&s;es an animal; and marble cut into a human figure, pro|duces great plea&s;ure by the re&s;emblance. But let a marble &s;tatue be coloured like a
<PB N="373" REF="386">
picture, the re&s;emblance is &s;o entire as to produce no effect. At a di&s;tance, it ap|pears a real per&s;on. We di&s;cover the mi&s;take when we approach; and no other emotion is rai&s;ed but &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by the deception. The idea of re&s;emblance is &s;unk into that of identity. The figure &s;till appears to our eyes rather to be a real per&s;on than a re&s;emblance of it; and we mu&s;t make u&s;e of our reflection to correct the mi&s;take. This cannot happen in a picture; for the re&s;emblance can never be &s;o entire as to di&s;gui&s;e the imitation.</P>
<P>The other remark regards contra&s;t. E|motions make the greate&s;t figure when contra&s;ted in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But then the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion ought neither to be precipitate nor immoderately &s;low. If too &s;low, the effect of contra&s;t becomes faint by the di&s;tance of the emotions; and if precipitate, no &s;ingle emotion has room to expand it&s;elf to its full &s;ize; but is &s;tifled as it were in the birth by a &s;ucceeding emotion. The funeral o|ration of the Bi&s;hop of Meaux upon the Du|che&s;s of Orleans, is a perfect hotchpotch of chearful and melancholy repre&s;entations
<PB N="374" REF="387">
following each other in the quicke&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. Oppo&s;ite emotions are be&s;t felt in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: but each emotion &s;eparately &s;hould be rai&s;ed to its due pitch, before an|other be introduced.</P>
<P>What is above laid down, will enable us to determine a very important que&s;tion concerning emotions rai&s;ed by the fine arts, <HI>viz.</HI> What ought to be the rule of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; whether ought re&s;emblance to be &s;tu|died or contra&s;t? The emotions rai&s;ed by the fine arts, are generally too nearly rela|ted to make a figure by re&s;emblance; and for that rea&s;on, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion ought to be regulated as much as po&s;&s;ible by con|tra&s;t. This holds confe&s;&s;edly in epic and dramatic compo&s;itions: and the be&s;t wri|ters, led perhaps by a good ta&s;te more than by rea&s;oning, have generally aimed at this beauty. In the &s;ame cantata, all the va|riety of emotions that are within the power of mu&s;ic, may not only be indulged, but, to make the greate&s;t figure, ought to be contra&s;ted. In gardening there is an addi|tional rea&s;on for the rule. The emotions rai&s;ed by that art, are at be&s;t &s;o faint, that
<PB N="375" REF="388">
every artifice &s;hould be u&s;ed to give them their utmo&s;t &s;trength. A field may be laid out in grand, &s;weet, gay, neat, wild, me|lancholy &s;cenes. When the&s;e are viewed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, grandeur ought to be con|tra&s;ted with neatne&s;s, regularity with wild|ne&s;s, and gaiety with melancholy; &s;o as that each emotion may &s;ucceed its oppo&s;ite. Nay it is an improvement to intermix in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, rude uncultivated &s;pots as well as unbounded views, which in them|&s;elves are di&s;agreeable, but in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion heighten the feeling of the agreeable ob|jects. And we have nature for our guide, who in her mo&s;t beautiful land&s;capes often intermixes rugged rocks, dirty mar&s;h|es, and barren &s;tony heaths. The greate&s;t ma&s;ters of mu&s;ic, have the &s;ame view in their compo&s;itions: the &s;econd part of an Italian &s;ong &s;eldom conveys any &s;entiment; and, by its har&s;hne&s;s, &s;eems purpo&s;ely con|trived to give a greater reli&s;h for the inter|e&s;ting parts of the compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A &s;mall garden comprehended under a &s;ingle view, affords little opportunity for this embelli&s;hment. Di&s;&s;imilar emotions
<PB N="376" REF="389">
require different tones of mind; and there|fore in conjunction can never make a good figure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>. Gaiety and &s;weetne&s;s may be combined, or wildne&s;s and gloomine&s;s; but a compo&s;ition of gaiety and gloomine&s;s is di&s;ta&s;teful. The rude uncultivated copart|ment of furze and broom in Richmond garden, hath a good effect in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects; but a &s;pot of this nature would be in&s;ufferable in the mid&s;t of a poli&s;hed parterre or flower-plot. A garden there|fore, if not of great extent, will not admit of di&s;&s;imilar emotions. And in ornamenting a &s;mall garden, the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e is to con|fine it to a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a land&s;cape ought al&s;o to be confined to a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion. It is accordingly a rule in painting, That if the &s;ubject be gay, every figure ought to contribute to that e|motion.</P>
<P>It follows from the foregoing train of rea|&s;oning, that a garden near a great city, ought to have an air of &s;olitude. The &s;oli|tarine&s;s again of a wa&s;te country ought to
<PB N="377" REF="390">
be contra&s;ted in forming a garden; no tem|ples, no ob&s;cure walks; but <HI>jets d'eau,</HI> ca&s;|cades, objects active, gay, and &s;plendid. Nay &s;uch a garden &s;hould in &s;ome mea|&s;ure avoid imitating nature, by taking on an extraordinary appearance of regularity and art, to &s;how the bu&s;y hand of man, which in a wa&s;te country has a fine effect by contra&s;t.</P>
<P>It may be gathered from what is &s;aid a|bove<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>, that wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture with grandeur. Di&s;&s;i|milar emotions have a fine effect in a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which approaches to co-exi&s;tence, they will not be reli&s;hed. In the mid&s;t of a laboured and elevated de&s;cription of a battle, Virgil introduces a ludicrous image, which is cer|tainly out of its place:
<Q><L>Obvius ambu&s;tum torrem Chorinaeus ab ara</L>

I fore&s;ee &s;eve|ral difficulties in keeping clo&s;e to my text; and yet by indulging a range, &s;uch as may be nece&s;&s;ary for a clear view, I &s;hall cer|tainly incur the cen&s;ure of wandering.&mdash;Be it &s;o. One ought not to abandon the right track for fear of cen&s;ure. The collateral matters, be&s;ide, that will be introduced, are curious, and not of &s;light importance in the &s;cience of human nature.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, is a &s;ubject formerly handled, &s;o far as it depends on the relations of objects and their
<PB N="381" REF="394">
mutual connections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 1.</NOTE>. But that &s;ubject is not exhau&s;ted; and I take the liberty to in|troduce it a &s;econd time, in order to explain in what manner we are affected by unifor|mity and variety. The world we inhabit is replete with things not le&s;s remarkable for their variety than their number. The&s;e, unfolded by the wonderful mechani&s;m of external &s;en&s;e, furni&s;h the mind with many perceptions, which, joined with ideas of memory, of imagination, and of reflection, form a complete train that has not a gap or interval. This tide of objects, in a conti|nual flux, is in a good mea&s;ure independent of will. The mind, as has been ob&s;erved<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke, book 2. chap. 14.</NOTE>, is &s;o con&s;tituted, <Q REND="inline">"That it can by no effort break off the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of its ideas, nor keep its attention long fixt upon the &s;ame object."</Q> We can arre&s;t a percep|tion in its cour&s;e; we can &s;horten its natu|ral duration, to make room for another; we can vary the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by change of place or amu&s;ement; and we can in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
<PB N="382" REF="395">
prevent variety, by frequently recalling the &s;ame object after &s;hort intervals: but &s;till there mu&s;t be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and a change from one thing to another. By artificial means, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion may be retarded or ac|celerated, may be rendered more various or more uniform, but in one &s;hape or other is unavoidable.</P>
<P>The rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, even when left to its ordinary cour&s;e, is not always the &s;ame. There are natural cau&s;es that accelerate or retard it con&s;iderably. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention depends on a peculiar con&s;titution of mind. One man is di&s;tingui&s;hed from another, by no circum&s;tance more remark|ably than the movement of his train of perceptions. A cold languid temper is ac|companied with a &s;low cour&s;e of percep|tions, which occa&s;ions dulne&s;s of apprehen|&s;ion and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s in action. To a warm temper, on the contrary, belongs a quick cour&s;e of perceptions, which occa&s;ions quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion and activity in bu&s;ine&s;s. The A&s;iatic nations, the Chine&s;e e&s;pecially, are ob&s;erved to be more cool and deliberate than the Europeans: may not
<PB N="383" REF="396">
the rea&s;on be, that heat enervates by ex|hau&s;ting the &s;pirits? A certain degree of cold, &s;uch as is felt in the middle regions of Europe, by bracing the fibres, rou&s;es the mind, and produces a bri&s;k circulation of thought, accompanied with vigour in ac|tion. In youth there is ob&s;ervable a quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of perceptions, than in old age. Hence in youth a remarkable avidity for va|riety of amu&s;ements, which in riper years give place to more uniform and more &s;e|date occupation. This qualifies men of middle age for bu&s;ine&s;s, where activity is required, but with a greater proportion of uniformity than variety. In old age, a &s;low and languid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion makes variety unne|ce&s;&s;ary; and for that rea&s;on, the aged, in all their motions, are generally governed by an habitual uniformity. Whatever be the cau&s;e, we may venture to pronounce, that heat in the imagination and temper, is al|ways connected with a bri&s;k flow of percep|tions.</P>
<P>The natural rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, depends al&s;o in &s;ome degree upon the particular per|ceptions that compo&s;e the train. An agree|able
<PB N="384" REF="397">
object, taking a &s;trong hold of the mind, occa&s;ions a &s;lower &s;ucce&s;&s;ion than when the objects are indifferent. Grandeur and no|velty fix the attention for a con&s;iderable time, excluding all other ideas; and the mind thus occupied feels no vacuity. Some emotions, by hurrying the mind from ob|ject to object, accelerate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Where the train is compo&s;ed of connected objects, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is quick. For it is &s;o ordered by nature, that the mind goes ea&s;i|ly and &s;weetly along connected objects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>. On the other hand, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;low where the train is compo&s;ed of un|connected objects. An unconnected object, finding no ready acce&s;s to the mind, requires time to make an impre&s;&s;ion. And that it is not admitted without a &s;truggle, appears from the un&s;ettled &s;tate of the mind for &s;ome moments after it is pre&s;ented, wavering be|twixt it and the former train. During this &s;hort period, one or other of the former ob|jects will intrude, perhaps oftener than once, till the attention be fixt entirely upon
<PB N="385" REF="398">
the new object. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations are applicable to ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by language. The mind can bear a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of re|lated ideas. But an unrelated idea, for which the mind is not prepared, takes time to make a di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion; and there|fore a train compo&s;ed of &s;uch ideas, ought to proceed with a &s;low pace. Hence an e|pic poem, a play, or any &s;tory connected in all its parts, may be peru&s;ed in a &s;horter time, than a book of maxims or apothegms, of which a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion creates both confu&s;ion and fatigue.</P>
<P>Such latitude hath nature indulged in the rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. What latitude it indul|ges with re&s;pect to uniformity we proceed to examine. The uniformity or variety of a train, &s;o far as compo&s;ed of external ob|jects, depends on the particular objects that &s;urround the percipient at the time. The pre&s;ent occupation mu&s;t al&s;o have an influ|ence; one is &s;ometimes engaged in a multi|plicity of affairs, &s;ometimes altogether va|cant. A natural train of ideas of memory is more circum&s;cribed, each object being linked, by &s;ome connection, to what pre|cedes
<PB N="386" REF="399">
and to what follows it. The&s;e con|nections, which are many and of different kinds, afford &s;cope for a &s;ufficient degree of variety; and at the &s;ame time prevent any exce&s;s that is unplea&s;ant. Temper and con|&s;titution al&s;o have an influence here, as well as upon the rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A man of a calm and &s;edate temper, admits not willing|ly any idea but what is regularly introduced by a proper connection. One of a roving di&s;po&s;ition embraces with avidity every new idea, however &s;lender its relation be to tho&s;e that go before it. Neither mu&s;t we overlook the nature of the perceptions that compo&s;e the train; for their influence is not le&s;s with re&s;pect to uniformity and variety, than with re&s;pect to the rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The mind ingro&s;&s;ed by any pa&s;&s;ion, love or hatred, hope or fear, broods over its ob|ject, and can bear no interruption. In &s;uch a &s;tate, the train of perceptions mu&s;t not only be &s;low, but extremely uniform. Anger newly inflamed eagerly gra&s;ps its ob|ject, and leaves not a cranny in the mind for another thought than of revenge. In the character of Hot&s;pur, this &s;tate of mind
<PB N="387" REF="400">
is repre&s;ented to the life; a picture remark|able for high colouring as well as for &s;trict|ne&s;s of imitation:

<P>Having viewed a train of perceptions as directed by nature, and the variations it is &s;u&s;ceptible of from different nece&s;&s;ary cau|&s;es, we proceed to examine how far it is &s;ubjected to will; for that will hath &s;ome influence, more or le&s;s, is ob&s;erved above. And fir&s;t, the rate of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion may be re|tarded by in&s;i&s;ting upon one object, and
<PB N="389" REF="402">
propelled by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing another before its time. But &s;uch voluntary mutations in the natural cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have limits that cannot be extended by the mo&s;t painful efforts. The mind circum&s;cribed in its ca|pacity, cannot, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, admit many perceptions; and when replete, it has no place for new perceptions till others be removed. For this rea&s;on, a voluntary change of perceptions cannot be in&s;tanta|neous; and the time it requires &s;ets bounds to the velocity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. On the other hand, the power we have to arre&s;t a flying perception, is equally limited. The longer we detain any perception, the more difficul|ty we find in the operation; till, the diffi|culty becoming un&s;urmountable, we are forced to quit our hold, and to permit the train to take its u&s;ual cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The power we have over this train as to uniformity and variety, is in &s;ome ca&s;es very great, in others very little. A train &s;o far as compo&s;ed of external objects, depends entirely on the place we occupy, and ad|mits not more or le&s;s variety but by change of place. A train compo&s;ed of ideas of me|mory,
<PB N="390" REF="403">
is &s;till le&s;s under our power. Ob|jects which are connected, afford the mind an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age from one to another. They &s;ugge&s;t each other in idea by the &s;ame means; and we cannot at will call up any idea that is not connected with the train<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 1.</NOTE>. But a train of ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by reading, may be varied at will, provided we have books in &s;tore.</P>
<P>This power which nature hath given us over our train of perceptions, may be great|ly &s;trengthened by proper di&s;cipline, and by an early application to bu&s;ine&s;s. Its im|proved &s;trength is remarkable in tho&s;e who have a &s;trong genius for the mathematics: nor le&s;s remarkable in per&s;ons devoted to re|ligious exerci&s;es, who pa&s;s whole days in contemplation, and impo&s;e upon them&s;elves long and &s;evere penances. It is not to be conceived, what length a habit of activity in affairs will carry &s;ome men. Let a &s;tran|ger, or let any per&s;on to whom the &s;ight is not familiar, attend the Chancellor of Great Britain through the labours but of one day,
<PB N="391" REF="404">
during a &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament: how great will be his a&s;toni&s;hment! what multipli|city of law-bu&s;ine&s;s, what deep thinking, and what elaborate application to matters of government! The train of perceptions mu&s;t in this great man be accelerated far beyond the common cour&s;e of nature. Yet no confu&s;ion nor hurry; but in every article the greate&s;t order and accuracy. Such is the force of habit! How happy is man, to have the command of a principle of action, that can elevate him &s;o far above the ordina|ry condition of humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This chapter was compo&s;ed in the year 1753.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>We are now ripe for con&s;idering a train of perceptions with re&s;pect to plea&s;ure and pain: and to this &s;peculation we mu&s;t give peculiar attention, becau&s;e it &s;erves to ex|plain the effects that uniformity and variety have upon the mind. A man is always in a plea&s;ant &s;tate of mind, when his percep|tions flow in their natural cour&s;e. He feels him&s;elf free, light, and ea&s;y, e&s;pecially af|ter any forcible acceleration or retardation. On the other hand, the re&s;i&s;tance felt in retarding or accelerating the natural cour&s;e, excites a pain, which, though &s;carcely felt
<PB N="392" REF="405">
in &s;mall removes, becomes con&s;iderable to|ward the extremes. An aver&s;ion to fix on any &s;ingle object for a long time, or to take in a multiplicity of objects in a &s;hort time, is remarkable in children; and equally &s;o in men unaccu&s;tomed to bu&s;ine&s;s. A man langui&s;hes when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is very &s;low; and, if he grow not impatient, is apt to fall a&s;leep. During a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he hath a feeling as if his head were turning round. He is fatigued, and his pain re&s;embles that of wearine&s;s after bodily labour. External objects, when they occa&s;ion a very &s;low or a very quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, produce a pain of the &s;ame &s;ort with what it felt in a volunta|ry retardation or acceleration: which &s;hows that the pain proceeds not from the violence of the action, but from the retardation or acceleration it&s;elf, di&s;turbing that free and ea&s;y cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which is naturally plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>But the mind is not &s;atisfied with a mo|derate cour&s;e alone: its perceptions mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;ufficiently diver&s;ified. Number without variety con&s;titutes not an agreeable train. In comparing a few objects, unifor|mity
<PB N="393" REF="406">
is agreeable: but the frequent reitera|tion of uniform objects becomes unplea&s;ant. One tires of a &s;cene that is not diver&s;ified; and &s;oon feels a &s;ort of unnatural re&s;traint when confined within a narrow range, whether occa&s;ioned by a retarded &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion or by too great uniformity. An exce&s;s in variety is, on the other hand, fatiguing. This is even perceptible in a train compo&s;ed of related objects: much more where the ob|jects are unrelated; for an object, unconnect|ed with the former train, gains not admit|tance without effort; and this effort, though &s;carce perceptible in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, be|comes by frequent reiteration exceeding painful. Whatever be the cau&s;e, the fact is certain, that a man never finds him&s;elf more at ea&s;e, than when his perceptions &s;ucceed each other with a certain degree, not only of velocity, but al&s;o of variety. Hence it proceeds, that a train con&s;i&s;ting entirely of ideas of memory, is never pain|ful by too great variety; becau&s;e &s;uch ideas are not introduced otherwi&s;e than according to their natural connections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 1.</NOTE>. The plea|&s;ure
<PB N="394" REF="407">
of a train of ideas, is the mo&s;t remark|able in a reverie; e&s;pecially where the ima|gination interpo&s;es, and is active in coining new ideas, which is done with wonderful facility. One mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;e|renity and ea&s;e of the mind in this &s;tate, makes a great part of the enjoyment. The ca&s;e is different where external objects enter into the train; for the&s;e, making their ap|pearance without any order, and without any connection &s;ave that of contiguity, form a train of perceptions that may be ex|tremely uniform or extremely diver&s;ified; which, for oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons, are both of them painful.</P>
<P>Any acceleration or retardation of the na|tural run of perceptions, is painful even where it is voluntary. And it is equally painful to alter that degree of variety which nature requires. Contemplation, when the mind is long attached to one thing, &s;oon becomes painful by re&s;training the free range of per|ception. Curio&s;ity and the pro&s;pect of ad|vantage from u&s;eful di&s;coveries, may en|gage a man to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies, not|with&s;tanding the pain they give him;
<PB N="395" REF="408">
and a habit of clo&s;e attention, formed by frequent exerci&s;e, may &s;often the pain. But it is deeply felt by the bulk of mankind, and produceth in them an aver&s;ion to all ab&s;tract &s;ciences. In any profe&s;&s;ion or cal|ling, a train of operation that is &s;imple and reiterated without intermi&s;&s;ion, makes the operator langui&s;h, and lo&s;e his vigor. He complains neither of too great labour nor of too little action; but regrets the want of variety, and his being obliged to do the &s;ame thing over and over. Where the o|peration is &s;ufficiently varied, the mind re|tains its vigor, and is plea&s;ed with its con|dition. Actions again create an unea&s;ine&s;s when exce&s;&s;ive in number or variety, though in every other re&s;pect agreeable. This unea&s;ine&s;s is extremely remarkable, where &s;trict attention mu&s;t be given, at the &s;ame time, to a number of different things. Thus a throng of bu&s;ine&s;s in law, in phy|&s;ic, or in traffick, di&s;tre&s;&s;eth and di&s;tracts the mind, unle&s;s where a habit of applica|tion is acquired by long and con&s;tant exer|ci&s;e. The exce&s;&s;ive variety is the di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing circum&s;tance; and the mind &s;uffers
<PB N="396" REF="409">
grievou&s;ly by being kept con&s;tantly upon the &s;tretch.</P>
<P>With relation to involuntary cau&s;es di&s;|turbing that degree of variety which na|ture requires, a &s;light pain affecting one part of the body without variation, becomes, by its con&s;tancy and long duration, almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The patient, &s;en&s;ible that the pain is not increa&s;ed in degree, com|plains of its con&s;tancy more than of its &s;everity, that it ingro&s;&s;es his whole thoughts, and gives admi&s;&s;ion to no other object. Pain, of all feelings, &s;eizes the attention with the greate&s;t force; and the mind, af|ter fruitle&s;s efforts to turn its view to ob|jects more agreeable, mu&s;t abandon it&s;elf to its tormentor. A &s;hifting pain gives le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e change of place contri|butes to variety. An intermitting pain, &s;uf|fering other objects to intervene, is not in|crea&s;ed by reiteration. Again, any &s;ingle colour or &s;ound often returning, becomes di&s;agreeable; as may be ob&s;erved in view|ing a train of &s;imilar apartments painted with the &s;ame colour, and in hearing the prolonged tollings of a bell. Colour and
<PB N="397" REF="410">
&s;ound varied within certain limits, though without any order, are agreeable; witne&s;s a field variegated with many colours of plants and flowers, and the various notes of birds in a thicket. Increa&s;e the number or va|riety, and the feeling becomes unplea&s;ant. Thus a great variety of colours, crowded upon a &s;mall canvas or in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, create an unea&s;y feeling, which is prevented by putting the colours at a greater di&s;tance either of place or time. A number of voi|ces in a crowded a&s;&s;embly, a number of a|nimals collected in a market, produce an unplea&s;ant emotion; though a few of them together, or all of them in a moderate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, would be agreeable. And becau&s;e of the &s;ame exce&s;s in variety, a number of pains felt in different parts of the body, at the &s;ame in&s;tant or in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, make an exqui&s;ite torture.</P>
<P>The foregoing doctrine concerning the train of perceptions, and the plea&s;ure or pain re&s;ulting from that train in different cir|cum&s;tances, will be confirmed by attending to the final cau&s;e of the&s;e effects. And as I am &s;en&s;ible that the mind, inflamed with
<PB N="398" REF="411">
&s;peculations of this kind &s;o highly intere&s;t|ing, is beyond mea&s;ure di&s;po&s;ed to convic|tion, I &s;hall be watchful to admit no argu|ment nor remark but what appears &s;olidly founded. With this caution I proceed to the inquiry. It is occa&s;ionally ob&s;erved a|bove, that per&s;ons of a phlegmatic tempe|rament, having a &s;luggi&s;h train of percep|tions, are indi&s;po&s;ed to action; and that activity con&s;tantly accompanies a bri&s;k mo|tion of perceptions. To a&s;certain this fact, a man need not go abroad for experiments. Reflecting upon things pa&s;&s;ing in his own mind, he will find, that a bri&s;k circulation of thought con&s;tantly prompts him to ac|tion; and that he is aver&s;e to action when his perceptions langui&s;h in their cour&s;e. But man by nature is formed for action, and he mu&s;t be active in order to be happy. Nature therefore hath kindly provided a|gain&s;t indolence, by annexing plea&s;ure to a moderate cour&s;e of perceptions, and by ma|king every remarkable retardation painful. A &s;low cour&s;e of perceptions is attended with another bad effect. Man in a few capital ca&s;es is governed by propen&s;ity or
<PB N="399" REF="412">
in&s;tinct; but in matters that admit delibe|ration and choice, rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned him for a guide. Now, as rea&s;oning requires often a great compa&s;s of ideas, their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion ought to be &s;o quick, as readily to furni&s;h every motive that may be nece&s;&s;ary for ma|ture deliberation. In a languid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, motives will often occur after action is com|menced, when it is too late to retreat.</P>
<P>Nature hath guarded man, her favourite, again&s;t a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion too rapid, not le&s;s care|fully than again&s;t one too &s;low. Both are equally painful, though the pain is not the &s;ame in both. Many are the good effects of this contrivance. In the fir&s;t place, as the bodily faculties are by certain painful &s;en&s;ations confined within proper limits, be|yond which it would be dangerous to &s;train the tender organs, Nature, in like manner, is equally provident with re&s;pect to the no|bler faculties of the mind. Thus the pain of an accelerated cour&s;e of perceptions, is Nature's admonition to relax our pace, and to admit a more gentle exertion of thought. Another valuable purpo&s;e may be gathered, from con&s;idering in what manner objects
<PB N="400" REF="413">
are imprinted upon the mind. To make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion as to give the memory fa&s;t hold of the object, time is required, even where attention is the greate&s;t; and a moderate degree of attention, which is the common ca&s;e, mu&s;t be continued &s;till long|er to produce the &s;ame effect. A rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion then mu&s;t prevent objects from making impre&s;&s;ions &s;o deep as to be of real &s;ervice in life; and Nature accordingly for the &s;ake of memory, has by a painful feel|ing guarded again&s;t a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But a &s;till more valuable purpo&s;e is an&s;wered by this contrivance. As, on the one hand, a &s;luggi&s;h cour&s;e of perceptions indi&s;po&s;eth to action; &s;o, on the other, a cour&s;e too rapid impels to ra&s;h and precipitant action. Pru|dent conduct is the child of deliberation and clear conception, for which there is no place in a rapid cour&s;e of thought. Nature therefore, taking mea&s;ures for prudent con|duct, has guarded us effectually from pre|cipitancy of thought, by making it painful.</P>
<P>Nature not only provides again&s;t a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion too &s;low or too quick, but makes the middle cour&s;e extremely plea&s;ant. Nor is
<PB N="401" REF="414">
this middle cour&s;e confined within narrow bounds. Every man can naturally without pain accelerate or retard in &s;ome degree the rate of his perceptions; and he can do this in a &s;till greater degree by the force of habit. Thus a habit of contemplation annihilates the pain of a retarded cour&s;e of perceptions; and a bu&s;y life, after long practice, makes acceleration plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Concerning the final cau&s;e of our ta&s;te for variety, it will be con&s;idered, that human affairs, complex by variety as well as num|ber, require the di&s;tributing our attention and activity, in mea&s;ure and proportion. Na|ture therefore, to &s;ecure a ju&s;t di&s;tribution corre&s;ponding to the variety of human af|fairs, has made too great uniformity or too great variety in the cour&s;e of our percep|tions equally unplea&s;ant. And indeed, were we addicted to either extreme, our internal con&s;titution would be ill &s;uited to our exter|nal circum&s;tances. At the &s;ame time, where a frequent reiteration of the &s;ame operation is required, as in &s;everal manufactures, or a quick circulation, as in law or phy&s;ic, Nature, attentive to all our wants, hath al&s;o provi|ded
<PB N="402" REF="415">
for the&s;e ca&s;es. She hath implanted in the brea&s;t of every per&s;on, an efficacious principle, which leads to habit. By an ob|&s;tinate per&s;everance in the &s;ame occupation, the pain of exce&s;&s;ive uniformity vani&s;heth; and by the like per&s;everance in a quick cir|culation of different occupations, the pain of exce&s;&s;ive variety vani&s;heth. And thus we come to take delight in &s;everal occupa|tions, that by nature, without habit, are not a little di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P>A middle rate al&s;o in our train of percep|tions betwixt uniformity and variety, is not le&s;s plea&s;ant, than betwixt quickne&s;s and &s;lowne&s;s. The mind of man thus con&s;titu|ted, is wonderfully adapted to the cour&s;e of human affairs, which are continually chan|ging, but not without connection. It is e|qually adapted to the acqui&s;ition of know|ledge, which re&s;ults chiefly from di&s;cover|ing re&s;emblances among differing objects, and differences among re&s;embling objects. Such occupation, even ab&s;tracting from the knowledge we acquire, is in it&s;elf delightful, by pre&s;erving a middle rate betwixt too great uniformity and too great variety.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="416">
We are now arrived at the chief purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent chapter; and that is to exa|mine how far uniformity or variety ought to be &s;tudied in the fine arts. And the knowledge we have obtained, will even at fir&s;t view &s;ugge&s;t a general ob&s;ervation, That in every work of art, it mu&s;t be agreeable to find that degree of variety which corre&s;ponds to the natural cour&s;e of our perceptions; and that an exce&s;s in variety or in uniformi|ty, mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable by varying that na|tural cour&s;e. For this rea&s;on, works of art admit more or le&s;s variety according to the nature of the &s;ubject. In a picture that &s;trongly attaches the &s;pectator to a &s;ingle ob|ject, the mind reli&s;heth not a multiplicity of figures or of ornaments. A picture again re|pre&s;enting a gay &s;ubject, admits great variety of figures and ornaments; becau&s;e the&s;e are agreeable to the mind in a chearful tone. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to poetry and to mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be remarked, that one can bear a greater variety of natural objects than of objects in a picture; and a greater variety in a picture than in a de&s;crip|tion.
<PB N="404" REF="417">
A real object pre&s;ented to the view, makes an impre&s;&s;ion more readily than when repre&s;ented in colours, and much more readily than when repre&s;ented in words. Hence it is, that the profu&s;e va|riety of objects in &s;ome natural land&s;capes, neither breed confu&s;ion nor fatigue. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, there is place for great|er variety of ornament in a picture, than in a poem.</P>
<P>From the&s;e general ob&s;ervations I proceed to particulars. In works expo&s;ed continually to public view, variety ought to be &s;tudied. It is a rule accordingly in &s;culpture, to contra&s;t the different limbs of a &s;tatue, in order to give it all the variety po&s;&s;ible. Though the cone in a &s;ingle view be more beautiful than the pyramid; yet a pyramidal &s;teeple, becau&s;e of its variety, is ju&s;tly preferred. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the oval in compo&s;itions is pre|ferred before the circle; and painters, in copying buildings or any regular work, endeavour to give an air of variety by repre|&s;enting the &s;ubject in an angular view: we are plea&s;ed with the variety without lo&s;ing
<PB N="405" REF="418">
&s;ight of the regularity. In a land&s;cape re|pre&s;enting animals, tho&s;e e&s;pecially of the &s;ame kind, contra&s;t ought to prevail. To draw one &s;leeping another awake, one &s;it|ting another in motion, one moving toward the &s;pectator another from him, is the life of &s;uch a performance.</P>
<P>In every &s;ort of writing intended for a|mu&s;ement, variety is nece&s;&s;ary in proportion to the length of the work. Want of variety is &s;en&s;ibly felt in Davila's hi&s;tory of the civil wars of France. The events are indeed im|portant and various: but the reader lan|gui&s;heth by a tire&s;ome uniformity of charac|ter; every per&s;on engaged being figured a con&s;ummate politician, governed by intere&s;t only. It is hard to &s;ay, whether Ovid di&s;|gu&s;ts more by too great variety or too great uniformity. His &s;tories are all of the &s;ame kind, concluding invariably with the trans|formation of one being into another. So far he is tire&s;ome with exce&s;s in uniformity. He al&s;o fatigues with exce&s;s in variety, by hurrying his reader ince&s;&s;antly from &s;tory to &s;tory. Ario&s;to is &s;till more fatiguing than Ovid, by exceeding the ju&s;t bounds of va|riety.
<PB N="406" REF="419">
Not &s;atisfied, like Ovid, with a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion in his &s;tories, he di&s;tracts the reader by jumbling together a multitude of uncon|nected events. Nor is the Orlando Furio&s;o le&s;s tire&s;ome by its uniformity than the Me|tamorpho&s;es, though in a different manner. After a &s;tory is brought to a cri&s;is, the read|er, intent upon the cata&s;trophe, is &s;uddenly &s;natched away to a new &s;tory, which is little regarded &s;o long as the mind is occupied with the former. This tantalizing method, from which the author never once &s;werves during the cour&s;e of a long work, be&s;ide its uniformity, hath another bad effect: it pre|vents that &s;ympathy which is rai&s;ed by an intere&s;ting event when the reader meets with no interruption.</P>
<P>The emotions produced by our percep|tions in a train, have been little con&s;idered, and le&s;s under&s;tood. The &s;ubject there|fore required an elaborate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It may &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome readers, to find variety treated as only contributing to make a train of perceptions plea&s;ant, when it is com|monly held to be a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in beauty of whatever kind; according to the
<PB N="407" REF="420">
definition, <Q REND="inline">"That beauty con&s;i&s;ts in uni|formity amid&s;t variety."</Q> But after the &s;ubject is explained and illu&s;trated as above, I pre&s;ume it will be evident, that this defi|nition, however applicable to one or other &s;pecies, is far from being ju&s;t with re&s;pect to beauty in general. Variety contributes no &s;hare to the beauty of a moral action, nor of a mathematical theorem; and num|berle&s;s are the beautiful objects of &s;ight that have little or no variety in them. A globe, the mo&s;t uniform of all figures, is of all the mo&s;t beautiful; and a &s;quare, though more beautiful than a trapezium, hath le&s;s variety in its con&s;tituent parts. The foregoing defini|tion, which at be&s;t is but ob&s;curely expre&s;&s;|ed, is only applicable to a number of ob|jects in a group or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, among which indeed a due mixture of uniformity and variety is always agreeable, provided the particular objects, &s;eparately con&s;idered, be in any degree beautiful. Uniformity a|mid&s;t variety among ugly objects, affords no plea&s;ure. This circum&s;tance is totally o|mitted in the definition; and indeed to have mentioned it, would at fir&s;t glance
<PB N="408" REF="421">
&s;how the definition to be imperfect. To define beauty as ari&s;ing from beautiful ob|jects blended together in a due proportion of uniformity and variety, would be too gro&s;s to pa&s;s current; as nothing can be more gro&s;s, than to employ in a definition the very term that is propo&s;ed to be ex|plained.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD>APPENDIX to Chap. IX. Concerning the works of nature.</HEAD>
<P>IN natural objects, whether we regard their internal or external &s;tructure, beauty and de&s;ign are equally con&s;picuous. We &s;hall begin with the out&s;ide of nature, as what fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The figure of an organic body, is gene|rally regular. The trunk of a tree, its branches, and their ramifications, are near|ly round, and form a &s;eries regularly de|crea&s;ing from the trunk to the &s;malle&s;t fibre. Uniformity is no where more remarkable
<PB N="409" REF="422">
than in the leaves, which, in the &s;ame &s;pe|cies, have all the &s;ame colour, &s;ize, and &s;hape. The &s;eeds and fruits are all regular figures, approaching for the mo&s;t part to the globular form. Hence a plant, e&s;pecially of the larger kind, with its trunk, branches, foliage, and fruit, is a delightful object.</P>
<P>In an animal, the trunk, which is much larger than the other parts, occupies a chief place. Its &s;hape, like that of the &s;tem of plants, is nearly round; a figure which of all is the mo&s;t agreeable. Its two &s;ides are preci&s;ely &s;imilar. Several of the under parts go off in pairs; and the two individuals of each pair are accurately uniform. The &s;in|gle parts are placed in the middle. The limbs, bearing a certain proportion to the trunk, &s;erve to &s;upport it, and to give it a proper elevation. Upon one extremity are di&s;po&s;ed the neck and head, in the direction of the trunk. The head being the chief part, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es with great propriety the chief place. Hence, the beauty of the whole fi|gure, is the re&s;ult of many equal and pro|portional parts orderly di&s;po&s;ed; and the &s;malle&s;t variation in number, equality, pro|portion,
<PB N="410" REF="423">
or order, never fails to produce a perception of ugline&s;s and deformity.</P>
<P>Nature in no particular &s;eems more pro|fu&s;e of ornament, than in the beautiful co|louring of her works. The flowers of plants, the furs of bea&s;ts, and the feathers of birds, vie with each other in the beauty of their colours, which in lu&s;tre as well as in harmony are beyond the power of imita|tion. Of all natural appearances, the co|louring of the human face is the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite. It is the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tance of the ineffable art of nature, in adapting and pro|portioning its colours to the magnitude, fi|gure, and po&s;ition, of the parts. In a word, colour &s;eems to live in nature only, and to langui&s;h under the fine&s;t touches of art.</P>
<P>When we examine the internal &s;tructure of a plant or animal, a wonderful &s;ubtility of mechani&s;m is di&s;played. Man, in his me|chanical operations, is confined to the &s;ur|face of bodies. But the operations of na|ture are exerted through the whole &s;ub|&s;tance, &s;o as to reach even the elementary parts. Thus the body of an animal, and of a plant, are compo&s;ed of certain great
<PB N="411" REF="424">
ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e of &s;maller; and the&s;e again of &s;till &s;maller, without end &s;o far we can di&s;cover. This power of diffu&s;ing mecha|ni&s;m through the mo&s;t intimate parts, is pe|culiar to nature; and di&s;tingui&s;hes her ope|rations, mo&s;t remarkably, from every work of art. Such texture, continued from the gro&s;&s;er parts to the mo&s;t minute, pre&s;erves all along the &s;tricte&s;t regularity. The fi|bres of plants are a bundle of cylindric ca|nals, lying in the &s;ame direction, and pa|rallel or nearly parallel to each other. In &s;ome in&s;tances, a mo&s;t accurate arrange|ment of parts is di&s;covered, as in onions, formed of concentric coats one within another to the very centre. An animal body is &s;till more admirable, in the di&s;po&s;i|tion of its internal parts, and in their order and &s;ymmetry. There is not a bone, a mu&s;cle, a blood-ve&s;&s;el, a nerve, that hath not one corre&s;ponding to it on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the animal; and the &s;ame order is carried through the mo&s;t minute parts. The lungs are compo&s;ed of two parts, which are di&s;po&s;ed upon the &s;ides of the thorax; and the kidneys, in a lower &s;ituation, have a
<PB N="412" REF="425">
po&s;ition not le&s;s orderly. As to the parts that are &s;ingle, the heart is advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated nigh the middle. The liver, &s;to|mach, and &s;pleen, are di&s;po&s;ed in the up|per region of the abdomen, about the &s;ame height: the bladder is placed in the middle of the body; as well as the inte&s;tinal canal, which fills the whole cavity by its convo|lutions.</P>
<P>The mechanical power of nature, not confined to &s;mall bodies, reacheth equally tho&s;e of the greate&s;t &s;ize; witne&s;s the bodies that compo&s;e the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, which, however large, are weighed, mea&s;ured, and &s;ubjected to certain laws, with the utmo&s;t accuracy. Their places around the &s;un, with their di&s;tances, are determined by a preci&s;e rule, corre|&s;ponding to their quantities of matter. The &s;uperior dignity of the central body, in re|&s;pect of its bulk and lucid appearance, is &s;uited to the place it occupies. The glo|bular figure of the&s;e bodies, is not only in it&s;elf beautiful, but is above all others fitted for regular motion. Each planet revolves about its own axis in a given time; and each moves round the &s;un, in an orbit
<PB N="413" REF="426">
nearly circular, and in a time proportioned to its di&s;tance. Their velocities, directed by an e&s;tabli&s;hed law, are perpetually chan|ging by regular accelerations and retarda|tions. In fine, the great variety of regular appearances, joined with the beauty of the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf, cannot fail to produce the highe&s;t delight in every per&s;on who can ta&s;te de&s;ign, power, or beauty.</P>
<P>Nature hath a wonderful power of con|necting &s;y&s;tems with each other, and of propagating that connection through all her works. Thus the con&s;tituent parts of a plant, the roots, the &s;tem, the branches, the leaves, the fruit, are really different &s;y&s;tems, united by a mutual dependence on each other. Thus in an animal, the lym|phatic and lacteal ducts, the blood-ve&s;&s;els and nerves, the mu&s;cles and glands, the bones and cartilages, the membranes and vi&s;cera, with the other organs, form di&s;tinct &s;y&s;tems, which are united into one whole. There are, at the &s;ame time, other connec|tions le&s;s intimate. Thus every plant is joined to the earth by its roots; it requires rain and dews to furni&s;h it with juices; and
<PB N="414" REF="427">
it requires heat to pre&s;erve the&s;e juices in fluidity and motion. Thus every animal, by its gravity, is connected with the earth, with the element in which it breathes, and with the &s;un, by deriving from it cheri&s;h|ing and enlivening heat. The earth fur|ni&s;heth aliment to plants, the&s;e to animals, and the&s;e again to other animals, in a long train of dependence. That the earth is part of a greater &s;y&s;tem, comprehending many bodies mutually attracting each other, and gravitating all toward one common centre, is now thoroughly explored. Such a regular and uniform &s;eries of connections, propagated through &s;o great a number of beings and through &s;uch wide &s;paces, is wonderful: and our wonder mu&s;t increa&s;e, when we ob&s;erve this connection propagated from the minute&s;t atoms to bodies of the mo&s;t enormous &s;ize, and widely diffu&s;ed, &s;o as that we can neither perceive its begin|ning nor its end. That it doth not termi|nate within our own planetary &s;y&s;tem, is certain. The connection is diffu&s;ed over &s;paces &s;till more remote, where new bodies and &s;y&s;tems ri&s;e to our view, without end. All &s;pace is filled with the
<PB N="415" REF="428">
works of God, which, being the operation of one hand, are formed by one plan, to an&s;wer one great end.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t wonderful connection of all, though not the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, is that of our internal frame with the works of nature. Man is obviou&s;ly fitted for con|templating the&s;e works, becau&s;e in this contemplation he has great delight. The works of nature are remarkable in their u|niformity not le&s;s than in their variety; and the mind of man is fitted to receive plea&s;ure equally from both. Uniformity and va|riety are interwoven in the works of nature with &s;urpri&s;ing art. Variety, however great, is never without &s;ome degree of u|niformity; nor the greate&s;t uniformity, without &s;ome degree of variety. There is great variety in the &s;ame plant, by the dif|ferent appearances of its &s;tem, branches, leaves, blo&s;&s;oms, fruit, &s;ize, and colour; and yet when we trace this variety through different plants, e&s;pecially of the &s;ame kind, there is di&s;covered a &s;urpri&s;ing uni|formity. Again, where nature &s;eems to have intended the mo&s;t exact uniformity,
<PB N="416" REF="429">
as among individuals of the &s;ame kind, there &s;till appears a diver&s;ity, which &s;erves readily to di&s;tingui&s;h one individual from another. It is indeed admirable, that the human vi&s;age, in which uniformity is &s;o prevalent, &s;hould yet be &s;o marked as to leave no room for mi&s;taking one per&s;on for another. The difference, though clearly perceived, is often &s;o minute as to go be|yond the reach of de&s;cription. A corre|&s;pondence &s;o perfect betwixt the human mind and the works of nature, is extremely remarkable. The oppo&s;ition betwixt va|riety and uniformity is &s;o great, that one would not readily imagine they could both be reli&s;hed by the &s;ame palate; at lea&s;t not in the &s;ame object, nor at the &s;ame time. It is however true, that the plea&s;ures they afford, being happily adju&s;ted to each other, and readily mixing in intimate union, are frequently produced in perfection by the &s;ame individual object. Nay further, in the objects that touch us the mo&s;t, unifor|mity and variety are con&s;tantly combined; witne&s;s natural objects, where this combi|nation is always found in perfection. It is
<PB N="317" REF="430">
for that rea&s;on, that natural objects readily form them&s;elves into groups, and are a|greeable in whatever manner combined: a wood with its trees, &s;hrubs, and herbs, is agreeable: the mu&s;ic of birds, the low|ing of cattle, and the murmuring of a brook, are in conjunction delightful; though they &s;trike the ear without modula|tion or harmony. In &s;hort, nothing can be more happily accommodated to the inward con&s;titution of man, than that mixture of uniformity with variety which the eye di&s;|covers in natural objects. And according|ly, the mind is never more highly gratified than in contemplating a natural land&s;cape.</P>
