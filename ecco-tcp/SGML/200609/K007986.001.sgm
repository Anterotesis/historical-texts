<HEAD>TO His Hone&s;t Friend Mr. <HI>WILLIAM PATE,</HI> Of <HI>London,</HI> Woollen-Draper.</HEAD>
<P>I Know no occa&s;ion wherein all &s;orts of People have taken greater liberty, than in their Dedications, both in regard of the Per&s;ons to whom the Com|plement is made, and of the things that are u&s;ually &s;aid in them. All Authors pretend to di&s;claim flattery upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and yet were Hi&s;torians to draw Great Men according as they are repre&s;ented in Dedi|cations, abundance of Per&s;ons would pa&s;s with Po&s;terity for men of wit, who never made a je&s;t in their lives, and for hone&s;t Patriots, who were only mere <HI>Fripons</HI> at the bottom; but tho mo&s;t Authors are agreed to wheedle and flatter in their Dedications, yet I &s;ee they are not &s;o well agreed in the choice of their Patron; &s;ome have cho&s;e whole Corporations, or Societies for this Office, and indeed this conduct would be politick enough, if the Parties, who are concerned in the De|dication were obliged to e&s;pou&s;e the Author's quarrel; others have gone a &s;tep further, and Dedicated their Books to the re&s;pective Countries where they live; and la&s;tly, &s;ome of a more Univer&s;al &s;pirit, have offered them to the whole World in general, without any re|&s;trictions or limitations, as it con&s;i&s;ts of the four known Parts, <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africk</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and comprehends per&s;ons of all &s;orts and characters, tho&s;e that can read as well as tho&s;e that cannot, and tho&s;e that have a Religion as well as tho&s;e that have none
<PB REF="3">
at all. But the generality of Writers decline this cour&s;e of Dedication, becau&s;e Bodies Politick, and Countries, and the World it &s;elf, as large as it is, &s;eldom reward the Author, for, as we &s;ay, what is every mans bu&s;i|ne&s;s, is no mans bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore they generally make choice of particular per&s;ons, and tho&s;e for the greate&s;t part of the be&s;t E&s;tates and Fortunes; not be|cau&s;e an Illu&s;trious name gives any better protection to a Book than a Meaner would do, altho this is always pretended, but becau&s;e &s;uch Per&s;ons are be&s;t able to re|ward an Author, and con&s;ider him for his incen&s;e. As I never knew a bad Book &s;ell a farthing the better for having a gaudy Title prefixed to it, &s;o a good one never fared the wor&s;e becau&s;e it appeared without a fine <HI>Fi|occo</HI>: For in &s;hort, if the world has a mind to be cen|&s;orious, a Per&s;on of Quality's name is as feeble an A|mulet again&s;t the Criticks, as a Silver Hor&s;e&s;hoe nail|ed upon a thre&s;hold would be again&s;t Witchery and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for I am of opinion, that an Hor&s;e&s;hoe made of Iron is full as powerful a pre&s;ervative as the other. Now I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> two rea&s;ons, Mr. <HI>Pate,</HI> to addre&s;s the fol|lowing Tran&s;lation to your &s;elf, the fir&s;t is becau&s;e you are my Friend, with who&s;e entertaining learned Con|ver&s;ation I have been often diverted, and the next is, becau&s;e I can approach you without any of that Cere|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Fine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">, which u&s;es to embarras a young Author &s;o much, when he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to Quality, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> as he is obliged to &s;ay &s;everal things again&s;t his Con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ence, &s;o he cannot a&s;&s;ume that familiarity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ne&s;s, which makes all &s;orts of Di&s;cour&s;es agreeable. However I would not have you think, that I am &s;o un|rea&s;onable as to de&s;ire you to &s;tand Surety, or (what in a few years will become a &s;candalous word with us God-father to my Tran&s;lation, becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;i|ble there are &s;everal faults in it, nor to &s;tand up for the Author of this Epi&s;tle, for then you mu&s;t re&s;olve to combat all comers and geers: All I require of you is
<PB REF="4">
that if any of your acquaintance &s;hould enquire either after the Book or the Tran&s;lator, you would only tell them that the Book gives a good account of a certain Prince's Court, who at this pre&s;ent writing is gazed at by all <HI>Europe,</HI> and that the Tran&s;lator is a very hone&s;t Fellow, who between a little <HI>French</HI> and le&s;s <HI>Latin</HI> makes a &s;hift to get a &s;orry Livelihood.</P>
<P>I have been often reproached, and particularly by your &s;elf for &s;itting idle a whole year, and writing no|thing of my own; now tho I mu&s;t confe&s;s a certain party among&s;t us has given us almo&s;t daily provocati|ons to encounter them, yet I find they are a generation that are never to be edified by Satyr, and indeed all whol&s;ome advice is effectually lo&s;t upon them. Suppo&s;e you or I &s;hould tell hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> yonder of <HI>Co|vent-Garden,</HI> that it was not civilly done of him to leave the Thirtieth of <HI>January, Good-Friday,</HI> and the Twenty ninth of <HI>May</HI> all at a clap cut of his Al|manack, and that <HI>John Gadbury</HI> and he may now &s;hake hands together, like a couple of Bigotted Ra&s;cals as they are, perhaps another year, (as who knows how far a turbulent Reformer's zeal may carry him) he will leave us never an Apo&s;tle in the Calendar, to the utter confu&s;ion of the poor People in the Country, who make no other u&s;e of the Apo&s;tles, but only to direct them to the next Hor&s;e-race or Fair. To &s;ay the truth, we have too many ridiculous follies, and divi&s;ions a|mong&s;t us ever to be cured by writing, which puts me in mind of what Mr. <HI>Burge&s;s,</HI> who has made all the Town merry with his Preaching, &s;aid lately upon this Argument: <HI>We</HI> Engli&s;hmen, crys he, <HI>have been fa|mous in all ages for our Wars and Jars, and &s;trife and life, and &s;o forth: Why, what do you think</HI> Virgil <HI>&s;aid of you &s;ixteen hundred years ago? Even</HI> Penitus toto divi&s;es orbe Britannos, i. e. <HI>the</HI> Britains <HI>are the mo&s;t divided people in the whole world.</HI> Thus you &s;ee, Mr. <HI>Pate,</HI> what little encouragement a
<PB REF="5">
man has to write, &s;ince it is &s;o unlikely that he &s;hould ever cure any of tho&s;e di&s;tempers that are &s;o in inve|terate in our Climate, but I have a more particular rea&s;on &s;till behind, which obliges me to &s;it a &s;pectator, and purely re&s;pects my &s;elf; for as I have had the ill luck to di&s;plea&s;e the Moderate Party by attacking the merits of the Comprehen&s;ion in my Dialogue, &s;o I have fallen under the indignation of the Criticks by being too profu&s;e and lavi&s;h of my Similies. As for the fir&s;t I have nothing to &s;ay to them, becau&s;e they are a &s;ort of Gentlemen, to whom I never de&s;igned to make my Court, and as for the la&s;t, before I go about to ju&s;tifie my &s;elf, I will tell you a &s;hort Story. I happened &s;ome years ago to make a Vi&s;it to an hone&s;t decayed old Cap|tain in <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and his Chamber was a perfect Wil|derne&s;s: Pipes and Napkins, and ends of Candles, and old Cloaks were jumbled all together, but what was mo&s;t remarkable a Loaf and a Chee&s;e lay upon his Clo&s;e-&s;teel. I asked him the rea&s;on of it, and the Captain hone&s;tly told me that he did it only for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. And this Mr. <HI>Pate</HI> was my own Ca&s;e exact|ly for there were &s;everal Per&s;ons in the world for whom I had a kindne&s;s, and the&s;e for want of a better con|venience I was often &s;orced to throw into a Simile, and to &s;ay the truth, &s;ome of them were &s;uch &s;ad wret|ches that they did not de&s;erve to have a Paragraph be&s;towed upon them.</P>
<P>But now to &s;peak a word or two in behalf of the&s;e Memoirs, I am in good hopes they will be favourable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">ved, becau&s;e they give us a true Idea of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Court, with which the generality of men among&s;t us, are utterly unacquainted, and la&s;tly becau&s;e they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">vide an agreeable entertainment to all &s;orts of peo|ple: For here is Rain and Sun-&s;hine, and Earthquakes and Shows, and Ma&s;querades, and Proce&s;&s;ions, and the Lord knows how much Hi&s;tory in Sippits to divert the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">lous Admirers <HI>Stow</HI> and <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">en&s;head</HI>: And
<PB REF="6">
then for Per&s;ons of better Palates here are abundance of Political reflections, and judicious ob&s;ervations, with the true rea&s;ons how this va&s;t Monarchy, which in the la&s;t Century made &s;o con&s;iderable a figure in the world, is in this become &s;o feeble and Paralytic. I will only take notice of one In&s;tance among the re&s;t to give you a true ta&s;te of this Author's Ingenuity. Don <HI>Juan,</HI> while the admini&s;tration of affairs was lodged in his hands removed a poor Dominican from <HI>Salamanca</HI> (which place you know a certain Doctor who pretends he has received more &s;tripes on his Back than St. <HI>Paul</HI> and all his Brethren did, has made remarkable in Story by the Chimerical Degree he took there) and made him the King's Confe&s;&s;or. He thought by this means to have &s;ecured the Monk for ever to his own Intere&s;ts, and to have had a tru&s;ty Confident upon all occa&s;ions near his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on: but he found him&s;elf mightily mi|&s;taken in his expectation, for this Bea&s;t of a Religious, &s;oon abandoned his Patron's party, and herded among&s;t his profe&s;t Enemies. <HI>Some People,</HI> &s;ays this Author, <HI>pretend that he did it out of a Principle of Con|&s;cience, but as for my &s;elf I am of another opi|nion: It is impo&s;&s;ible that Ingratitude &s;hould ever flow from any good Principle.</HI> I am &s;orry that this hone&s;t Doctrine is not in better Reputation with &s;ome People among&s;t us, for I am &s;atisfied that no pretence whatever can atone for &s;o black and un|generous a Sin as Ingratitude is.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here, according to the laudable Cu&s;tom of all Authors, take occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething in your prai&s;e, but be&s;ides that I will not offer that Violence to your Mode&s;ty, I cannot hand&s;omely commend you, for &s;o great a variety of Learning in &s;o much Youth, but at the expence of the City, and you know I have too great a re&s;pect for our Honourable Metropolis to do any thing of that nature, or indeed without a reproach to our &s;elves, who cannot pretend &s;uch excu&s;es, as the perpe|tual
<PB REF="7">
di&s;tractions of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s. Indeed if your good fortune in the world prove an&s;werable to your merits, you may for all I know dye a richer man than <HI>Gre&s;ham</HI> or <HI>Sutton</HI>: But I mu&s;t tell you, my dear Friend, that good Fortune and Merit are two as dif|ferent things as any are in the world. I knew a Gentle|man who made a plea&s;ant remark upon this occa&s;ion. I have, &s;aid he, in my time laid out for two things, <HI>viz.</HI> Preferment and a Red No&s;e, with as much zeal and applicaiton as any man in Town. To attain the la&s;t I have dutifully drank my Gallon of Claret every night, and a dull &s;ober Sot, a Neighbour of mine, with his &s;ingle penurious Pint has arrived to it before me: and as for the former I have wearied out my Pati|ence in waiting at Court, and at Noblemens Levees, and yet could never &s;tumble upon any; and &s;o he con|cluded that &s;everal men come by Preferment and Red No&s;es, who never de&s;erved either of them.</P>
<P>After all, Mr. <HI>Pate,</HI> if my wi&s;hes will do you any good, I wi&s;h you &s;tore of Cu&s;tomers, but never a Poet, or Courtier, or disbanded Captain, or Player among&s;t them all. May I be &s;o fortunate as to behold you advanced to the highe&s;t Pinacle of honour in the City, to furni&s;h new matter for <HI>Elkanah Settle</HI>'s Triumphs of <HI>London,</HI> to &s;entence light Butter and Bread on Hor&s;eback, to terrify Sabbath-breakers, and tho&s;e that forget to hang out their Lights, to appear in the next Edition of <HI>Baker</HI> or <HI>Stow,</HI> and arrive to the Priviledge of &s;leeping in your Gold Chain at <HI>Guild|hall</HI> Chappel. In &s;hort, may you be the wealthie&s;t hap|pie&s;t man within the Bills of Mortality, and may you ever continue to love</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE COURT OF SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t not expect to find in a general Hi&s;tory tho&s;e particu|lar Relations of things, that u|&s;ually entertain the Reader bet|ter than the Hi&s;tory it &s;elf: but when any per|&s;on is once acquainted with them, he often re|flects upon them with a great deal of Plea&s;ure. I imagine I may without any flattery pretend my &s;elf capable of writing &s;everal &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;a|ges, that happened at <HI>Madrid</HI> from the year 1679, to the year 1681. However I think it not ami&s;s to begin the&s;e Memoirs from the time of <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. in order to render the following Di&s;|cour&s;e more intelligible, and to give the Reader a better Idea of the Genius of the <HI>Spani&s;h Court.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9">
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> his Queen, being dead, he e&s;pon&s;ed <HI>Mary Ann</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Daughter of the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and Si&s;ter of him that reigns at pre&s;ent. She was young, of a fair flaxen complexion, her humour was lively and plea&s;ant, and &s;he was no le&s;s agreeable than witty.</P>
<P>She departed from <HI>Vienna,</HI> in order to go to <HI>Spain</HI> in the year 1649. She loved the Arch-Duke her Brother very affectionately, and as both of them were weeping when they took their leave of one another, &s;he demanded of him what lay in her power to do for his &s;ervice: My dear Si&s;ter, &s;ays he, it lies in your power to have an Infanta there, which you may give to me in marriage. This acci|dent is &s;o much the more ob&s;ervable, becau&s;e the Arch-Duke having at that time an Elder Brother, who died afterwards King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and being him&s;elf de&s;igned for the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic State, there was little probability that he &s;hould ever arrive to the Empire, and marry, as it &s;ince fell out, the Elde&s;t Daughter of the Queen his Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Among&s;t &s;everal other per&s;ons, whom the Emperor gave the Queen his Daughter to ac|company her into <HI>Spain,</HI> he cho&s;e Father <HI>John Evrard Nitard,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Je&s;uit, to be her Con|fe&s;&s;or. His extraction was mean and ob&s;cure, and he employed almo&s;t all his thoughts in the advancing of his fortune. He was of a &s;upple complai&s;ant temper, he exactly &s;tudied the re|&s;pective characters of tho&s;e per&s;ons to whom he belonged, and took care never to differ much from them as to matters of opinion. He fini&s;hed his Studies in the Je&s;uits College at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and there took upon him the Habit of his Order and afterwards was &s;ent to govern one of their
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Seminaries, in which Office he acquitted him&s;elf very well. When he came back again to <HI>Vienna,</HI> he began to make him&s;elf known in the world, and &s;everal Ladies of the Court de&s;ired him to be their Spiritual Director: they omitted no opportunity to do him all the good offices they could with the Emperor; and in fine, &s;poke in &s;uch advantageous Terms of him, that he was well enough contented to let the Queen take him along with her.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s was extreamly &s;urprized at all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms, which tho&s;e who came to wait upon her from the King, cau&s;ed her to ob|&s;erve in the fir&s;t Days of her Voyage. I have been told that as &s;he arrived to a certain City under the Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> where the principal Commodities of the place con&s;i&s;ted in Frocks, Wa&s;tcoats and Silk Stockings; they made her a pre&s;ent of a great quantity of them, of different Colours: But her <HI>Major Domo</HI> who religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> gravity, de&s;pi&s;ed the pre&s;ent, and &s;o taking up a Bundle of Silk Stockings, threw them at the heads of the Deputies of the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Aveis de Saber,</HI> &s;ays he to them in a very fu|rious Tone, <HI>que las Reynas de E&s;pagna no teinen piernas,</HI> that is to &s;ay,</P>
<P><HI>I would have ye to know that the Queens of</HI> Spain <HI>have no Legs</HI>; meaning, that they are &s;o far ele|vated above others by vertue of their Rank, that they have no Feet to touch the Ground like the re&s;t of their Sex. However it was, the young Queen, who was not as yet acquainted with the Niceties of the Spani&s;h Language, took it in the literal Sen&s;e, and began to weep, <Q REND="inline">&s;aying that &s;he was fully determined to go back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and if &s;he had known before her de|parture from thence that they de&s;ign'd to cut
<PB N="4" REF="11">
off her Legs, &s;he would rather have died, than &s;tirred a Foot.</Q></P>
<P>It was no difficult Matter to a&s;&s;ure her of the contrary, and &s;he continued her Voyage.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to <HI>Madrid</HI> they told the King of this innocent Simplicity of his Queen, he was &s;o mightily plea&s;ed at the Story, that he vouch&s;afed to laugh a little at it, and this was the mo&s;t ex|traordinary thing in the world for him to do, for whether it proceeded from affectation, or was the effect of his Con&s;titution, it was ob&s;erved of him that he never laugh'd above thrice in all his Life.</P>
<P>The King &s;how'd a great re&s;pect for Father <HI>Nitard</HI> becau&s;e he was the Queen's Confe&s;&s;or, who repo&s;ed an intire Confidence in him, but whatever de&s;ires &s;he had to &s;ee him advanced, he left him peaceably in his po&s;t, without confer|ring any other Dignities upon him, and he had unque&s;tionably continued a long time in the &s;ame condition, if the King had not hapned to die.</P>
<P>When that Prince found him&s;elf to be dan|gerou&s;ly ill, and &s;aw he could not bequeath the care of his Kingdoms to Cardinal <HI>Sandoval,</HI> up|on who&s;e Management of Affairs he always de|pended, becau&s;e he was at that time extremely &s;ick, and to &s;ay the truth, died but 20 hours after him; he made his Will, wherein he or|dered that the Queen his Spou&s;e &s;hould be Re|gent of the Kingdom, and Governe&s;s of the young Prince, who was then four years and an half old,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Since the time of <HI>Don Loys de Haro.</HI> the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have had no <HI>Privado</HI> or chief Mini&s;ter: The Duke <HI>di Medina de las Torres</HI> had the Management of the Northern Adairs, and the Count <HI>de Ca&s;trillo</HI> of the re&s;t.</NOTE> he named the Cardinal of <HI>Arragon,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI> and Inqui&s;itor General; the Count of <HI>Ca&s;trillo</HI> Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> the

<P>The Queen re&s;ented the great Lo&s;s &s;he &s;u&s;tain|ed with abundance of Sorrow, but &s;he had been &s;till more &s;en&s;ible of it, if &s;he had found her &s;elf in the Condition of the other Queens of <HI>Spain,</HI> who are obliged to enter into a Convent, when they are Widows, unle&s;s the King orders the contrary before his Decea&s;e; Nor was &s;he in&s;en&s;ible of the Sweets of Governing.

The de&s;ire they had to pre&s;erve their own Au|thority, and the jealou&s;ie which is natural for all Men to have of a Favourite, made them &s;peak very fiercely in the matter: However the Queen being informed of their di&s;content, took the true Mea&s;ures to appea&s;e them. The charming Manner of her Deportment, and particularly the obliging things &s;he &s;poke to them upon this occa&s;ion, prevailed with them to lay a&s;ide their Murmurs, &s;o they agreed to di&s;patch Letters of Naturalization for the Confe&s;&s;or, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to execute the Office the Queen had given him.</P>
<P>Altho all tho&s;e difficulties that at fir&s;t threat|ned to hinder the Elevation of Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> were removed without any great Trouble, yet he did not fail to rai&s;e &s;everal &s;ecret Enemies upon

him&s;elf, who envied his growing Fortune. They beheld with great Di&s;dain and Impatience the extraordinary Confidence that the Queen repo&s;ed in him, for &s;he determined nothing without ad|vi&s;ing with him, and &s;o great was his Credit, and Intere&s;t with her that he dur&s;t offer to re&s;olve things of the greate&s;t Importance, without &s;peak|ing a word about them to the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> was one of tho&s;e that was the mo&s;t offended at the Advancement of Father <HI>Nitard:</HI> He was &s;en&s;ible that they would turn him out of all by little and little, upon this Score he gave way intirely to the Father Confe&s;&s;or, whom the Q. had made Coun&s;ellor of State; he then retired to <HI>Con&s;uegra</HI> the ordinary Re&s;idence of the Grand Prior of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> of the order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;aid very imperiou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline">that after he had &s;een him|&s;elf Pre&s;ident of the Privy Council of the King his Father, he could never endure a Compani|on that was &s;o much his Inferior.</Q> But the Queen who was wholly bu&s;ied in advancing her chief Mini&s;ter, never di&s;quieted her &s;elf with thinking what Reflections People might make upon him, &s;o that without taking the lea&s;t notice of <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s di&s;content, &s;he &s;uffered him to depart, and he continued a long time without vi&s;iting the Court, until the Queen &s;ent him particular Or|ders at <HI>Aranjues,</HI> whither he was gone to divert him&s;elf, to come immediately for <HI>Madrid</HI> upon &s;ome important Affairs, which &s;he was willing to communicate to him.</P>
<P>He was the natural Son of King <HI>Philip</HI> IV. and a certain Actre&s;s who&s;e name was <HI>Maria Calderona.</HI> He was privately brought up at <HI>Ocana</HI> near <HI>Madrid,</HI> and of all the natural Sons that King had, he only acknowledged him, whe|ther it were becau&s;e he loved his Mother better than any of his other Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es (and to &s;ay the
<PB N="8" REF="15">
truth &s;he was the mo&s;t charming per&s;on in the World) or becau&s;e Count <HI>d'Olivarez</HI> procured this good Fortune for him; for 'tis commonly given out that the Count had a Son named <HI>Don Julian de Gu&s;man,</HI> whom he had a mind to own, and therefore u&s;ed this Artifice of per&s;wading the King to begin with <HI>Don Juan,</HI> that &s;o he might follow his Example.</P>
<P>Whatever the matter was, <HI>Philip</HI> loved this young Prince very tenderly, altho &s;ome people &s;u&s;pected he was the Son of the Duke of <HI>Medina,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gu&s;man,</HI> who had formerly been pa&s;&s;ionately in love with the young <HI>Calderona,</HI> and was in his time the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd hand&s;om Cavalier in <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Don Juan</HI> very much re&s;embled him. But if &s;ome per&s;ons were of this Opinion, others could never believe it, e&s;pecially when they con&s;idered the great kind|ne&s;s and fatherly affection that the King had for him, and be&s;ides reflected upon his extraordina|ry good Qualities, which declared him to be wor|thy to be the Son of &s;o great a Monarch. He was brave even to a Contempt of all Dangers whate|ver, gallant and agreeable, well-&s;haped, obli|ging, liberal, and a per&s;on of great Honour; he had abundance of Wit, and was Ma&s;ter of a Genius that extended it &s;elf to all Arts and Sci|ences. As there is ne're a Court in <HI>Europe</HI> where natural Sons are treated with &s;uch advantageous Di&s;tinctions as they are in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o this Prince could &s;carce perceive that the unhappine&s;s of his Birth did in the lea&s;t prejudice his Advancement; and tis indeed a certain truth, that we &s;ee in this Country, the legitimate Sons bred up with tho&s;e that are not &s;o in the &s;ame father's hou&s;e, with|out any Di&s;tinction between one and the other. But this Cu&s;tom is not altogether ob&s;erved with relation to the natural Sons of the Kings of <HI>Spain:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="16">
For example, they never be&s;tow the title of <HI>In|fante</HI> upon them, and <HI>Don Juan</HI> who pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to have it, u&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to ac|compli&s;h it, but had not the fortune to &s;ucceed in his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>From the year 1643 the King had given him the Government of the <HI>Low Countries</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">He held as his proper Right the Government of the <HI>Low Countries.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> and <HI>Charolois,</HI> and he always enjoyed it, ex|cepting the time when the Arch-duke <HI>Leopold</HI> go|verned there.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> contributed very much towards the reducing the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Obedience: He took <HI>Piombino</HI> and <HI>Portolongone,</HI> and in all his Campaigns he perform d a World of Actions that equally te&s;tified his Bravery and Conduct.</P>
<P>The King his Father having conceived no le&s;s an e&s;teem than Tenderne&s;s for him, Communica|ted to him the mo&s;t weighty Affairs of State, and cho&s;e him to be chief of an A&s;&s;embly of the chief Mini&s;ters of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>He was &s;carcely arrived at <HI>Madrid</HI> but a Council was held, where he came to be informed that the King of <HI>France</HI> was re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;ts of his Queen, to whom <HI>Brabant</HI> and &s;ome other &s;tates of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> e&s;cheated by right of Devolution, upon the Death of the Infant <HI>Don Balthazar</HI> her Brother; that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had publi&s;hed a Manife&s;to wherein he proved the Ju&s;tice of his claim, and that not thinking him&s;elf obliged to con&s;ume any time in unprofitable Conte&s;tations, he had turned his Arms towards that &s;ide of the Coun|try; that he had marched his Troops with in|credible diligence, and made con&s;iderable con|que&s;ts
<PB N="10" REF="17">
as &s;oon as ever he appeared. Upon a &s;e|rious examination of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Mo|narchy, they were convinced that it was impo&s;|&s;ible at the &s;ame time to maintain War again&s;t <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to lay hold of a certain conjuncture that made a very plau&s;ible appearance; that <HI>Don Al|phon&s;o</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> having by his extravagant conduct lo&s;t the hearts of his People, was di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;t of the Government, and his Subjects freed from the Allegiance they ow'd him; that the In|fanta <HI>Don Pedro</HI> his Brother had taken upon him the Admini&s;tration of Affairs; that things of this con&s;iderable importance could neither be begun nor ended without &s;ome di&s;turbance, during which they mu&s;t have occa&s;ion for their own Troops, and therefore if it was judged expedi|ent they &s;hould lay hold of this opportunity to advance propo&s;als for a Peace.</P>
<P>After every one had delivered his own opinion of the matter, the Queen came to this conclu&s;ion. A Letter was di&s;patched to the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> who was at that time Pri&s;oner of War at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> wherein he had all nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions given him. In fine, he managed the affair &s;o dexterou&s;|ly, that the Regent <HI>Don Pedro</HI> li&s;tened favourably to the propo&s;als, and &s;o a Treaty of Peace was concluded on the 13th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1668.</P>
<P>This News was entertained at <HI>Madrid</HI> with a great deal of &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e the affairs of <HI>Flanders</HI> grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome &s;peedy mea&s;ures to pre&s;erve it, or el&s;e to abandon it for good and all. New Levies of Soldiers were ordered in <HI>Gallicia</HI> and el&s;ewhere, and the Queen ca&s;t her eyes upon <HI>Don Juan</HI> to &s;end him thither to com|mand the Troops; for be&s;ides that no Body was more capable of &s;o great a Tru&s;t than he was, &s;he
<PB N="11" REF="18">
had ob&s;erved that during the little &s;tay he made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> his Aver&s;ion to F. <HI>Nitard</HI> daily increa|&s;ed, and this rea&s;on alone was &s;ufficient to incline her to re&s;olve upon his Removal. She was not able to indure tho&s;e biting Reflections which <HI>Don Juan</HI> by way of Raillery very Liberally be&s;towed upon the Father Confe&s;&s;or. One time among the re&s;t when the Mini&s;ters demanded of him who was fit to &s;end again&s;t the King of <HI>France.</HI> <Q REND="inline">I am clearly of Opinion, &s;ays he, that we had be&s;t &s;end Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> he is a Saint to whom Heaven can re|fu&s;e nothing; the po&s;t wherein we behold him at pre&s;ent is an undeniable Proof of tho&s;e mira|cles, which he can command upon all occa&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or an&s;wered, with a very Melan|cholly Air, <Q REND="inline">That he was of a Profe&s;&s;ion which taught him to hope every thing from the Divine Mercy, but that it did not belong to his Function to be a General of an Army. Oh my dear Fa|ther, replies <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and don't we &s;ee your Reverence every day Employed in things that are full as un&s;uitable to your Profe&s;&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P>As I &s;aid before, it was re&s;olved to &s;end the Prince with the New Supplies to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and a Recruit of nine hundred thou&s;and Crowns, with which they Furni&s;hed him out of the Silver that was brought in the Gallions.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ary Orders were likewi&s;e di&s;patched to <HI>Cales,</HI> and &s;o the Admiral who had Charge given of this Sum, &s;et Sail with eight Ve&s;&s;els, from thence at the &s;ame time when <HI>Don Juan</HI> was Mar|ching towards the <HI>Groyne,</HI> where the Rendezvous was appointed to be.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet Crui&s;ed upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Gallicia,</HI> and was Compo&s;ed of 36 Ve&s;&s;els and 6 Fire&s;hips. <HI>Don Juan</HI> finding his Forces much Inferiour to the Enemy was not willing to hazard all in a Fight, where in all probability he could
<PB N="12" REF="19">
not avoid a total Defeat. Therefore he thought it more advi&s;ed to &s;end his Troops in &s;mall Bo|dies to <HI>Flanders,</HI> where they arrived without any Danger.</P>
<P>The formidable Power of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty not only alarm'd the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who after a bloody War at Fa&s;t concluded a Peace at <HI>Breda</HI> in 1667. and having cea&s;t from all Acts of Ho&s;tility towards one another, entred into a League, in the begin|ning of 1668. to oblige the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to ac|cept of one of the two alternatives propo&s;ed by the King of <HI>France,</HI> who &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Offers.</P>
<P>After their Example the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Triers,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Elector <HI>Palatino,</HI> and Duke <HI>Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus</HI> of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;nabruck,</HI> concerted their Re&s;olutions for the common Safety, and made a League, whereby they obliged them&s;elves to endeavour the adju&s;t|ing the differences between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or el&s;e to declare War again&s;t either of the two Crowns that &s;hould refu&s;e their Mediation, and act again&s;t the Treaty. The Pope likewi&s;e en|tred into the League, and a Peace was conclu|ded at <HI>Aix la Chapelle.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e things were not &s;o &s;peedily deter|mined, but that other matters of con&s;equence happened at <HI>Madrid</HI> and other places. which &s;trangely perplexed tho&s;e per&s;ons that were in|tere&s;ted and concerned in them. <HI>Don Juan</HI> as was before mentioned, was at <HI>Corogne</HI> upon the point of imbarquing him&s;elf, when he received certain Informations of the Death of <HI>Jo&s;eph Mal|lades</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Arragon</HI> whom he entirely loved. It was told him to his unexpre&s;&s;ible A|mazement, that he had been &s;ecretly arre&s;ted at <HI>Madrid</HI> about eleven a clock at Night; and that
<PB N="13" REF="20">
by an order of the Queen written by her own hand, he was &s;trangled two hours after. The great care they took to keep this execution pri|vate only contributed to make it &s;pread the fa&s;t|er, and it was not doubted but that the Queen &s;acrificed this unfortunate Gentleman to the &s;e|curity of her Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> was extremely concerned at the Tragical Death of a per&s;on whom he loved &s;o well, and yet more enraged at the injury which he imagined him&s;elf to have directly received from Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> re&s;olved not to go to <HI>Flan|ders.</HI> <Q REND="inline">They would never have expo&s;ed me to the pui&s;ance of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, (&s;ays he to <HI>Don Diego de Vala&s;co,</HI> for whom he had an extraordinary Affection) but only with a de&s;ign to compleat my Ruine. They will certainly take care to keep back tho&s;e Succours from time to time, of which I &s;hall &s;tand in need, and what&s;oever good Conduct I may u&s;e in the Management of the War, there is no Que&s;tion to be made, but that they will make me an&s;wera|ble for all the ill Succe&s;s we meet with. You &s;ee I am now at the Port, and yet they have executed a Man who was guilty of no other Crime than of wearing the Character of my Friend. What will they do then if I were once in <HI>Flanders,</HI> all my Friends would undoubtedly find them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the Malice and Hatred of the new Favourite.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;carched the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Pretences he could think of, to-excu&s;e his going for <HI>Flanders.</HI> For &s;ome days he feigned him&s;elf to be indi&s;po|&s;ed, and &s;ent word to the Queen that he was troubled with a Defluxion on his Brea&s;t, that the Phy&s;icians had made him apprehend the fatal Con&s;equences of it if he undertook &s;o long a Voyage, and therefore he be&s;eeched her to di&s;|pen&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="21">
with him. An Alteration &s;o little expected made a great Noi&s;e at Court, and gave no &s;mall Mortification to her Maje&s;ty and Father <HI>Nitard.</HI> They ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at the Cau&s;e, and if they had imagined the Prince was no farther off, perhaps they had not Sentenced <HI>Malladas</HI> to die &s;o &s;oon. The Queen ordered <HI>Don Juan</HI> to re&s;ign his employ to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who was to go to <HI>Flanders</HI> in his room, and al&s;o Commanded him to go immediately to <HI>Con&s;uegra,</HI> without Pre&s;u|ming to come nearer than 20 Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which he accordingly Obey'd. But it &s;eems this O|bedience was not enough to &s;atisfie the Queen's Indignation, who was &s;o Exa&s;perated at him, that in <HI>August</HI> 1668. &s;he carried into the Council with her own Hands a Decree again&s;t the Prince; wherein &s;he repre&s;ented to them <Q REND="inline">the Di&s;obedi|ence he had &s;hown at &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a Juncture, and the Rea&s;ons which ought to have Obliged him to &s;et Sail, altho' the Indi&s;po&s;ition he pretended had been really True; that a Lye from a Subject to his Sovereign was always thought Worthy of the highe&s;t Puni&s;hments, and e&s;pecially un|der &s;uch important Circum&s;tances.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> was informed of all that this Decree contained again&s;t him, and he was the more &s;en&s;i|bly concerned at this ill U&s;age, &s;ince he had Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ed &s;o much upon Moderation, in not making a louder Complaint of the Death of <HI>Malladas.</HI></P>
<P>The Man that &s;erved altogether to e&s;trange his Inclinations from the Queen, was a Captain, who&s;e name was <HI>Don Petro de Pinilla,</HI> who ha|ving asked leave to &s;peak with the Queen, threw him&s;elf at her Feet, and Entertained her an hour in Private without any Bodies know|ing what he &s;aid to her. It is not doubted by what happened afterwards but that he di&s;covered &s;omething of Importance again&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="22">
<HI>Don Bernardo Pategno,</HI> Brother to <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s chief Secretary, becau&s;e he was &s;eized the next Morning with 2 of his Servants. The&s;e Informa|tions were kept &s;o Secret that no one knew the Matters they contain'd. The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Salinas,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guards, received Orders from the Queen to Po&s;t away with fifty of the re|formed Officers, and Arre&s;t the Prince at <HI>Con&s;ue|gra</HI>; but altho' he u&s;ed the utmo&s;t diligence in this Affair, yet he was not able to find him. That, as it happened, did not prove Unlucky to him, for <HI>Don Juan</HI> had about him at that time a great number of his Friends and Dome&s;ticks, who would all have hazarded their Lives to pre&s;erve him from being taken; but by his great Pru|dence he avoided the Expo&s;ing any &s;ingle Man of them, for being Adverti&s;ed of what had pa&s;|&s;ed he withdrew in time, and only left a Letter behind him to the Queen, dated <HI>Octob.</HI> 21. wherein he &s;poke to her with greater Liberty than he had hitherto u&s;ed. He there takes an occa&s;ion to acquaint her, <Q REND="inline">That he would have certainly gone for <HI>Flanders,</HI> if it had not been for the Surprizing and Tragical Death of his Friend <HI>Malladas</HI>; that he had all the rea&s;on in the World to believe that Father <HI>Nitard</HI> was the In&s;trument and Author of it; that &s;o horrid an Inju&s;tice cried out aloud for Vengeance again&s;t the Man that had committed it; that he found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;t with an earne&s;t De&s;ire to contri|bute what lay in his Power towards the removal of &s;o Wicked a Man; that he humbly Be&s;eeched her both for the good of the Kingdom in gene|ral, as al&s;o for her Maje&s;ties Glory to con&s;ent to his Bani&s;hment; that he hop'd he &s;hould never be con&s;trained to have recour&s;e to any other Methods than tho&s;e of Prayer to cha&s;e him out of that place, where his Pre&s;ence was become

odious to all the World; that he found him|&s;elf obliged to go and &s;eek a Sanctuary again&s;t the Violences of this Stranger, and that this was a cruel nece&s;&s;ity for a Per&s;on of his Quality; that he hoped her Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to make &s;erious Reflections upon the whole, and apply nece&s;&s;ary Remedies accordingly.</Q></P>
<P>The Reading of this Letter awakened all the Re&s;entment and Indignation that the Queen had naturally to <HI>Don Juan:</HI> She flew into the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, and had made it appear in a terrible manner, if the Grandees and Peo|ple had not te&s;tified le&s;s Inclination for her. I was a new Subject of Di&s;plea&s;ure to the Queen and Father <HI>Nitard</HI> to &s;ee that all the World a|greed to &s;et them&s;elves free from his Mini&s;try, and that they had the hardine&s;s to tax him pub|lickly with the murder of <HI>Malladas,</HI> and the im|pri&s;onment of <HI>Patigno.</HI></P>
<P>This obliged the Queen to &s;et forth a Decla|ration, wherein &s;he a&s;&s;ured the World that both tho&s;e per&s;ons came to <HI>Madrid</HI> to execute the wicked De&s;igns of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> that &s;he was fully inform'd of the whole by their own proper Con|fe&s;&s;ion, and that &s;he had never proceeded &s;o far as to take away <HI>Malladas</HI>'s life if &s;he had not been a&s;&s;ured of his Crime.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Father <HI>Nitard</HI> printed and publi&s;hed a &s;ort of an Apology, in which he accu&s;es <HI>Don Juan</HI> with having frequently endea|vour'd to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; he &s;poke of this de&s;ign as a thing beyond Conte&s;t, and declared his own innocence with relation to the Death of <HI>Malladas,</HI> and the impri&s;onment of <HI>Patigno.</HI> He pretended to give an undeniable Proof of this A&s;&s;ertion, in alledging that when the former was &s;trangled, he was &s;aying over his Breviary along with Frier <HI>Bu&s;tos</HI>; and that when the &s;econd was arre&s;ted, he

was &s;etting his Papers in order in his Cabinet. Then he took occa&s;ion to enlarge upon the No|blene&s;s of his Birth, and upon the con&s;iderable Services which his Ance&s;tors had done for the Emperours. This Article only &s;erved to &s;et People on work to Examine the Ob&s;curity of his Family. He Addre&s;&s;ed this writing to the Queen, and &s;he for her part forgot nothing that might make his Atte&s;tation be the better believed.</P>
<P>Some time after &s;he pre&s;ented to the Council a &s;econd Complaint again&s;t the Prince, charging him with having had his Nativity Calculated in <HI>Flanders</HI>; in which 'twas ea&s;ie to di&s;cover the high and mighty expectations with which he fed his Ambition. That &s;uch an in&s;ufferable Curio&s;ity had been always Puni&s;hed as a Crime of High Trea&s;on, that it was not only nece&s;&s;ary to Exa|mine the Fault, but al&s;o the Quality of the Per&s;on that committed it, that the debate was about a Man of De&s;ign, who could by no means pretend to Sin out of Ignorance; and an ungrateful rebel|lious Subject loaded with Favours and Rewards by the Crown; that it was ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to Cha&s;ti&s;e him, for fear le&s;t a connivance &s;hould Authorize his wicked De&s;igns, and put him in a Capacity of accompli&s;hing them.</P>
<P>The Prince had too many Friends, not to find &s;ome among&s;t them who had the Courage to Defend him; there was &s;carce any thing to be &s;een in all manner of company but multitude of writings, the bitterne&s;s of which only &s;erved to animate the intere&s;ted Parties, and make them more Inveterate.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that appear'd in behalf of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> main|tained that he was Incapable of forming &s;o mean and low a De&s;ign as that of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Father <HI>Ni|tard</HI>; that if it had ever entred into his Imaginati|on, the Execution of it could have been no difficult

Matter; that the difference was only about a Stranger of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, without Friends or Re|lations, &s;upported by a Queen who ought to have abandoned him to Vengeance, when &s;he was in|formed of his wicked Conduct; that the be&s;t Proof one can bring to &s;hew that the Prince had no in|clination to do any &s;uch thing was, becau&s;e it was not done; that far from endeavouring to take him off Privately, he had demanded in publick to have him removed from his Mini&s;try, and that for attempting his removal, he expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to all the Indignation of the Queen: That at the bottom, Father <HI>Nitard</HI> would have no rea|&s;on to complain of his ill U&s;age, &s;ince he was per|mitted to retire with the Puni&s;hment only of a Pen&s;ion of 60000 Crowns <HI>per annum,</HI> which he has hitherto enjoyed, be&s;ides &s;ome other Private Benevolences that don't appear; that &s;o con&s;i|derable a Revenue one would think might Con|tent the Ambition of a &s;imple Eccle&s;ia&s;tic; who was him&s;elf of &s;o Vindicative a Nature, that he would fain have A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the Prince at <HI>Barce|lona</HI> and <HI>Con&s;uegra</HI>; that it was not the Effect of any particular re&s;entment which made <HI>Don Juan</HI> Pre&s;s the Queen &s;o earne&s;tly to &s;end him home to his own Country, being generous enough to forget any Private Injuries; but that he was too good a Subject to bear any longer with a Man, who&s;e ra&s;h and violent Coun&s;els might &s;ome time or other prove the occa&s;ion of a general Revolu|tion in the Kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI> To this they ad|ded &s;everal other things, which I &s;hall pa&s;s over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The Court and the City were divided upon this Point, every one engaging him&s;elf in the Affair, either as his own Sentiments led him, or as he was Influenced by the Reports of others. Nay the Court Ladies entred into the quarrel,
<PB N="19" REF="26">
and for a Di&s;tinction of the Party they embraced, &s;ome were called <HI>Au&s;trians,</HI> and others <HI>Nitardines.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have given you a Relation of what pa&s;t at <HI>Madrid,</HI> during the time that <HI>Don Juan</HI> kept him&s;elf at a di&s;tance from it, and approached to <HI>Barcelona.</HI> The Queen was Ignorant what way he took, and her Di&s;quietudes doubled upon her, when &s;he con&s;idered with her &s;elf what dange|rous Effects an Affair of this Nature might carry along with it, e&s;pecially &s;eeing it began with &s;o much Heat. When he was Arrived there he writ a very re&s;pectful Letter to the Queen, but did not conceal the Re&s;olution he had taken, to Demand of her con&s;tantly the removal of her Confe&s;&s;or; he advi&s;ed her to it with very forcible Rea&s;ons, but they only provoked her the more again&s;t him, and &s;he could never &s;uffer her &s;elf to be per&s;waded, that &s;he ought to deprive her &s;elf of the Man in whom &s;he repo&s;ed &s;o intire a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">ce, and for whom &s;he pre&s;erved &s;o great an Affection. <Q REND="inline">She found that <HI>Don Juan</HI> med|dled with an Affair &s;he had no Inclination to, and that &s;ince the Council which the late King had A&s;&s;igned her, could find nothing to except again&s;t the Father's Conduct, &s;he was not obliged to gratifie an Aver&s;ion, which the Prince had &s;o unju&s;tly entertained again&s;t him; that it would be for her Glory, to Te&s;tifie to the World the firmne&s;s of her Mind in this Rencounter; and that if &s;he Abandoned her Servants at the fir&s;t Chimerical Objections that were rai&s;ed again&s;t them, it would be a dangerous Matter for any one to &s;erve her.</Q> In fine, the extream de&s;ire &s;he had to keep Father <HI>Nitard</HI> with her, furni&s;hed her with &s;uch &s;pecious Rea&s;ons, that no Body dur&s;t Combat them.</P>
<P>The Father on his Part knew not where to turn him&s;elf, he was plea&s;ed without Que&s;tion to
<PB N="20" REF="27">
&s;ee him&s;elf beloved and protected by &s;o great a Queen, and to enjoy an ab&s;olute Power next to her; but on the other hand, he was not with|out &s;en&s;ible Emotions when he con&s;idered what an Enemy he had to deal with: He was appre|hen&s;ive of being poy&s;oned or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and tho the Council had not as yet &s;poken again&s;t him, yet he was not ignorant that he was but ill beloved by all the Mini&s;ters. And that if ever it was his Fortune to be turned out, the greate&s;t Part of the Grandees would commend the Cou|rage and Con&s;tancy of <HI>Don Juan.</HI> The&s;e Reflexi|ons &s;o palled his Spirits, that he often went and threw him&s;elf at her Maje&s;ty's feet, with Tears in his Eyes, humbly to beg the favour of her to &s;uffer him to depart: but &s;he always a&s;&s;ur'd him of the Continuance of her Protection, and for|bad him any more to mention that thing, which gave her &s;o much Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Prince did not content him&s;elf w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> wri|ting to the Queen, but writ al&s;o to the chief Mini&s;ters, in &s;uch vehement Terms, that they evidently &s;aw what it was he de&s;ired to do with the Father Confe&s;&s;or, and likewi&s;e that he would never depart from his Re&s;olutions. He pray'd them to &s;econd him with her Maje&s;ty, and to repre&s;ent to her, of what a mighty Con|&s;equence it would be to the State, to &s;end this Stranger home.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters mightily augmented the Trou|bles of F. <HI>Nitard,</HI> his friends were afraid that <HI>Don Juan</HI> would betake him&s;elf to violent Methods, and his Enemies had the Satisfaction to con&s;ider that the Prince would employ his utmo&s;t Ef|forts to turn him out of <HI>Spain.</HI> But tho&s;e that beheld the whole Scene calmly and without Pa&s;&s;ion, judged that the Queens Ob&s;tinacy and the Opiniatrete of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> would nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="21" REF="28">
involve the Kingdom in &s;ome great di&s;orders, where every thing would be equally confound|ed. The Queen fell into the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, whenever the matter was mention|ed to her, and finding her per&s;on to be no where el&s;e in Safety, &s;he order'd the Cavalry to come to <HI>Pardo,</HI> which is a Royal Palace within two Leagues of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain, that if &s;he had had le&s;s Fears up|on her, &s;he had at that Moment declared <HI>Don Juan</HI> Rebel. She communicated this De&s;ign to her Father. Confe&s;&s;or, who approved of this way of procedure well enough, but others that were con&s;ulted about it, oppo&s;ed it with all their Might. They repre&s;ented to her, <Q REND="inline">That in ca&s;e this was done, the Prince would no lon|ger ob&s;erve any Mea&s;ures with her, that per|haps he waited for a favourable Pretence to de|clare him&s;elf; that he was brave in his own per&s;on, well beloved by his Friends, and be|&s;ides had the people on his &s;ide; that le&s;s cau&s;es have occa&s;ioned great Revolutions; that there was nothing left but good U&s;age and Gentle|ne&s;s that could make him return to his Duty, or at lea&s;t convince him that nothing had been o|mitted to in&s;pire him with a true Sen&s;e of it.</Q> Altho this Advice was extremely oppo&s;ite to the Queens Re&s;entments, and by her good Will &s;he would never have treated with a Prince, by whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her &s;elf to be injured, yet &s;he was at la&s;t per&s;waded to follow this good Coun|&s;el. So &s;he wrote a very obliging Letter to him, wherein &s;he conjured him to return to <HI>Cor&s;uegra,</HI> and &s;he engaged her Royal Word for the Secu|rity of his Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> made &s;ome Difficulty at fir&s;t of obeying the&s;e Orders, whether it were, becau&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive, as he told the Queen, of
<PB N="22" REF="29">
putting him&s;elf into the Hands of Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> whom he had but lately e&s;caped, or for &s;ome o|ther rea&s;ons that are unknown: But the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;ore,</HI> who was then at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> &s;poke to him with &s;o much Zeal, and &s;o vigorou&s;ly Solli|cited him to obey her Maje&s;ty's Orders, that he &s;ubmitted to his Rea&s;ons, and &s;o departed with three Companies of Hor&s;e, which the Duke had given him for his Guard.</P>
<P>The Queen having received Advice of it, con|trived to give him &s;ome Affronts upon the Road. She knew that he was to pa&s;s through <HI>Arragon,</HI> and therefore &s;he writ to the States of that King|dom to &s;hew <HI>Don Juan</HI> no manner of Re&s;pect, nay, even to &s;eek out &s;ome opportunities to di&s;gu&s;t him; but herein &s;he was ill obey'd. The States &s;ent her word back again, that they could not di&s;pence with them&s;elves from Paying to the Son of the late King, and the Brother of their pre&s;ent Monarch, tho&s;e Devoirs that were due to his Quality and Merits. To &s;ay the Truth, they acquitted them&s;elves herein with the great|e&s;t Zeal; and when he approached <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> all the Inhabitants went out above two Leagues to meet him on the way. The Pre&s;s was &s;o great that he had much ado to get through it, they cried all with one voice, <HI>Let the King live, and the Lord</HI> Don Juan<HI>, let him always have the better of his Enemies, ana Cur&s;es light on the Je&s;uit that Per|&s;&s;ecutes him.</HI></P>
<P>Every one &s;catter'd Flowers before him, &s;uch as the Sea&s;on of the Year furni&s;hed them with, and &s;prinkled him with perfumed Waters; the Ladies better apparell'd than they u&s;ed to be on the mo&s;t Solemn Days, made a double Lane for him with their Coaches; the Air was filled with nothing but the Benedictions and Prai&s;es they
<PB N="23" REF="30">
be&s;tow'd upon him: In a Word, the Joy was Univer&s;al in this great City.</P>
<P>The Queen and Father Confe&s;&s;or, who re|ceived a faithful Relation of the whole proceed|ings, were &s;en&s;ibly concerned, She to &s;ee the Contempt wherewith her Orders were Enter|tain'd, He to find him&s;elf &s;o inveterately hated by the People.</P>
<P>The Report of <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s extraordinary Re|ception &s;pread it &s;elf as far as <HI>Madrid</HI>; and a|mong&s;t &s;everal Per&s;ons that receiv'd it with Joy and Satisfaction, there were many that Appre|hended &s;ome Di&s;order at the return of the Prince.</P>
<P>In Order to prevent tho&s;e Evils that &s;eemed to threaten them, the Regidors and other Ma|gi&s;trates of that City A&s;&s;embled on the fir&s;t of <HI>February.</HI> They &s;ent four of their Body to the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> to repre&s;ent to him the great mi&s;chief that might be occa&s;ioned by <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s Arrival with his Troops, at a time when the Court was &s;o weak, and the People &s;o in&s;olent and di&s;po&s;ed for a Revolt; that notwith&s;tand|ing the Prince was well Affectioned towards them, yet he would not be able to prevent the lamenta|ble Effects they had rea&s;on to fear.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident waited upon the Queen, and the Council immediately met, where it was or|dered to di&s;patch a Courier to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> with her Maje&s;ty's Orders to &s;end back his Guards without delay.</P>
<P>He received the Order, but ha&s;tened his March, making the Courier follow him two days, on the third he gave him a Receipt for his Order, and &s;ent him back without any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In the mean time that he delay'd the Couriers coming back, they were alarm'd at Court with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his Voyage, and their unea&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="31">
was much increas'd in the Palace, when they &s;aw him &s;ent back without any Letter. Some of the Lords went thereupon to find out the Pre&s;ident, to de&s;ire him to tell the Queen, that they were ready to undertake any thing in the World for her Service. The Cavalry was drawn up toge|ther, and Preparations were making at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to &s;u&s;tain a Siege, the event whereof appeared very doubtful, altho they had to deal with a Prince who was only attended by 300 Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>'Twas in effect this Guard that occa&s;ioned the greate&s;t trouble; the Queen ordered the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Penalva</HI> to a&s;&s;emble the reformed Offi|cers together, with tho&s;e that &s;hould offer them|&s;elves, to go upon this occa&s;ion, and tell the Prince, that her Maje&s;ty ordered him to &s;end back the three Troops of Hor&s;e, he had brought along with him.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Penalva</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed to obey, but he demanded an Order of the Coun|cil Royal, and the Secretary of State refu&s;ed to expedite it, alledging that the Queen could do nothing without the Council of the Govern|ment, and that &s;he had never con&s;ulted them about this Affair. The Queen being provoked, &s;ent the Secretary word, <Q REND="inline">That he ought &s;eri|ou&s;ly to con&s;ider what Difficulties he was go|ing to &s;tart at &s;o ill an Exigence, and how lit|tle they were to the purpo&s;e.</Q> The Cardinal <HI>Arragon,</HI> the Count <HI>de Penarauda,</HI> and the Vice-Chancellor came to wait upon her Maje&s;ty; they repre&s;ented to her, that the Secretary was in the right, and gave the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> a &s;evere Reprimand for giving way by his Coun|&s;els to an Order that might have produced very evil Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>They re&s;olved at la&s;t not to take up Arms; and to di&s;&s;ipate the Apprehen&s;ions the people
<PB N="25" REF="32">
were under at <HI>Madrid,</HI> 'twas publickly pro|claimed that <HI>Don Juan</HI> had &s;ent back his Guards, or that if he had not done it as yet, yet he would &s;end them back at the fir&s;t warning.</P>
<P>The Queen having no hopes at all of &s;eeing her &s;elf obeyed by force, betook her &s;elf to more gentle Methods, to try if &s;he could by that Con|duct oblige <HI>Don Juan</HI> to &s;end back his Soldiers: She writ to him by <HI>Don Diego de Vela&s;co,</HI> who was his great Confident, and the Letter was ve|ry courteous and civil.</P>
<P>The Prince, who came &s;ecretly to <HI>Madrid</HI> to di&s;cover the State of Affairs, the Di&s;po&s;itions of his Friends, and what he might be able to effect there, very re&s;olutely &s;ent the Queen word again, that there lay no Obligation upon him to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the Revenge of Father <HI>Ni|tard,</HI> therefore he po&s;itively demanded to have him turn'd out of the Kingdom; that after this were once done, none of all her Subjects &s;hould pay a more dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion to her Orders than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This was to demand a thing of the Queen, which &s;he had no manner of inclination to grant; The Nuncio <HI>Borrom&eacute;e,</HI> the Council of State, and the Grandees gave them&s;elves a great deal of trouble to no purpo&s;e to adju&s;t the mat|ter. In the mean time the Prince appeared &s;o firm in his Re&s;olution, that all the World judg|ed it would be very happy for the Confe&s;&s;or, if he could e&s;cape with his Life. He him&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible enough of the Danger he was in, &s;o he redoubled his Importunities with the Queen to &s;uffer him to depart. She returned him no an&s;wer but by her Tears and Sighs, in|&s;omuch that he cho&s;e rather to expo&s;e his own Life to the utmo&s;t Extremity, than di&s;oblige her by leaving her Service.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="33">
News arrived, that the Prince was come with his Troops to <HI>Torrejon-dardos,</HI> which is but four Leagues from <HI>Madrid.</HI> Tho&s;e that were of the Queens party were mightily di&s;quieted at it, and &s;he her &s;elf was more afflicted than the re&s;t. They heard her &s;everal, times repeat the&s;e words, <HI>Oh Heavens! this good Father will be the first Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>The Council of the Government met, and de&s;ired the Nuncio to carry <HI>Don Juan</HI> the Let|ter the Pope had written to him, wherein he conjured him to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Sentiments of re|&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion for the Queen, which a Subject ow'd his Soveraign.</P>
<P>The Nuncio went to find him, and came back about midnight. No Body almo&s;t in this great City went to bed, but attended his Return with impatience, for they knew the occa&s;ion of his Journey; and the people ran up and down the Streets in great Bodies, asking each other who they were for. The news the Nuncio brought back with him did not at all plea&s;e the Queen, he told her that he had earne&s;tly reque&s;ted the Prince to go to <HI>Guadalajara,</HI> or at lea&s;t to &s;tay where he was a few days, that new mea&s;ures might be taken to &s;atisfie him, but that the Prince refu&s;ed both the one and the other, and &s;aid, that if on the <HI>Monday</HI> following the Confe&s;|&s;or would not go out of the Gate, he would throw him out at the Window, and enter <HI>Ma|drid</HI> on purpo&s;e to put it in execution. It was afterwards known, that this Negotiation pa&s;&s;ed after another manner, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Prince had agreed to let Father <HI>Nitard</HI> be with the Queen, provided &s;he would grant &s;ome advantages to him which he propo&s;ed; but that the Nuncio, who had no kindne&s;s for that Father, was re&s;olved to break the Treaty all to pieces
<PB N="27" REF="34">
by concealing the favourable inclinations of <HI>Don Juan.</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Nitard</HI> was informed of all that hap|pened, he Confe&s;&s;ed the Queen the next morning, and afterwards threw him&s;elf at her feet, be|&s;eeching her not to expo&s;e him to the outrages which he might expect to &s;uffer from an incen&s;ed Prince, that his life was at &s;take, and that there was no other way to pre&s;erve it, but by &s;ubmitting to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. The Queen an&s;wered him with abundance of Tears, that he &s;hould not di&s;quiet him&s;elf at all, for &s;he would take care to &s;et things to rights again.</P>
<P>He was well enough &s;atisfied of her own good will for him, but he que&s;tioned whether her power an&s;wered her inclinations; neverthele&s;s he re&s;olved at la&s;t that he would be torn in pieces by the people, before he would leave <HI>Ma|drid</HI> without her Order. So he tarried with her, having all the Apprehen&s;ions upon him that a man, who every moment expects his death, can be capable of.</P>
<P>The&s;e affairs came to this up&s;hot at la&s;t, that on <HI>Monday</HI> the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> the great Court of the Palace was filled with numbers of peo|ple of all conditions, who in a di&s;orderly man|ner, that was not ea&s;ie to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, loudly demanded to have the Confe&s;&s;or di&s;carded without any more Delay, <Q REND="inline">That no body was ig|norant of what <HI>Don Juan</HI> had &s;aid to the Nun|cio; that the City would go near to be expo|&s;ed to Plunder and De&s;olation for the &s;ake of a Je&s;uit who was a Stranger, and had no other merit to recommend him but his plea&s;ing the Queen.</Q></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>d'Infantado</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> &s;eeing &s;uch a va&s;t Multitude a&s;&s;embled to|gether, ran to the Queens Apartment, who

was then in Bed: She had not clo&s;ed her Eyes all night long, and had not enjoy'd one Moment of Re&s;t, having it &s;eems received &s;ome informa|tion of what had pa&s;t. One of her Ladies, who&s;e name was <HI>Donna Eugenia,</HI> was upon her Knees by her to comfort her in the&s;e Extremities. <HI>Alas,</HI> &s;aid the Queen to her, <HI>what &s;ignifies my Grandeur, and the&s;e high Titles they give me, &s;ince I am not al|lowed the Liberty to keep the good Man any longer with me, upon whom the Con&s;olation of my Life de|pends?

<P>The Council &s;at immediately becau&s;e the Di&s;|order &s;till increa&s;ed in the City, and it was to be feared that it would augment more and more. Some of the Mini&s;ters, who were in the Queens Intere&s;ts, were for finding out &s;ome Expedient to hinder the Departure of Father <HI>Nitard</HI>; but others pretended there was no room left for an Accommodation, and &s;aid that if the bu&s;ine&s;s was any longer delayed, all would be lo&s;t: That <HI>Don Juan</HI> would &s;oon enter <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Friends and Enemies would fare alike, that their Debate at pre&s;ent was only about a poor Eccle&s;i|a&s;tic, whom the People hated even to Madne&s;s and never mentioned without the bittere&s;t Exe+crations, altho at the Bottom he never de&s;erved them, and was an hone&s;t Man.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Don Bla&s;co</HI> was gone, the Queen u&s;ing no farther violence with her &s;elf to keep in her Tears, &s;hed them very plentifully, and ca&s;ting her &s;elf upon the bed with all the grief imaginable cryed out ince&s;&s;antly, <HI>Alas! alas! to what purpo&s;e is it to be a Queen and Regent!</HI> On the other hand the Council commanded the Car|dinal of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Penarauda</HI> to go and acquaint Father <HI>Nitard</HI> with the order her Maje&s;ty had &s;igned. He who had long expect|ed this Tempe&s;t, &s;eemed not to be &s;urprized at the News, but was per&s;waded by the Nuncio's im|portunities not to go to Council as he had de&s;ign|ed, for he told him the people were &s;o highly in|cen&s;ed again&s;t him, that he would infallibly run the ri&s;que of being torn to pieces if he offer'd to &s;hew him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Superiors of the Je&s;uits were come to wait upon him to prepare him for this fatal Stroak. The Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> came thither al&s;o, telling him with great Fiercene&s;s and the
<PB N="31" REF="38">
freedom of Conver&s;ation, that &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes Per&s;ons of Quality from others, that he had drawn all the&s;e Misfortunes upon him&s;elf by his own ill Mea&s;ures, which he there particularly enumerated to him. The Father who had been never accu&s;tomed to the&s;e Repri|mands, replyed that this Di&s;cour&s;e was not fit for an Inqui&s;itor General to hear before all the World.</P>
<P>When the Cardinal of <HI>Arragon</HI> arrived, he found the Father extremely afflicted. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity of parting immediately without &s;o much as taking leave of the Queen his Mi&s;tri&s;s touch'd him to the quick. The Cardinal was not able to refrain Tears at beholding it, whether from a Con&s;ideration of the Incertainty of humane Af|fairs that have no &s;ure Foundation, or el&s;e from the particular E&s;teem he always had for him. He offer'd to furni&s;h him with a thou&s;and Pi&s;tols for his Voyage, and the Count <HI>de Penarauda</HI> with Let|ters of Exchange for thirty thou&s;and Ducats, but he would not accept of them, &s;aying, that as he came thither a poor Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, &s;o he knew well enough how to depart from thence under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Cardinal comforted him as well as he was able, and told him that he would accompa|ny him to <HI>Fuencaral,</HI> then he withdrew to leave him at Liberty to &s;et his own things in Order, and towards the Evening came to take him up in his Coach, which was well guarded: He asked him immediately whether all his things were ready, I have no other things, replies the Father, &s;ave only my Habit and Breviary, &s;o they departed, being accompanied by all the Officers of the In|qui&s;ition. As &s;oon as ever the people &s;aw Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> they fell a crying and throwing Stones at him, and followed him with Cur&s;es and Im|precations:
<PB N="32" REF="39">
It happen'd well for him that he was in company with a per&s;on of the Cardinal's Dignity for otherwi&s;e he had been expo&s;ed to the fury of the Rabble. The Grief that &s;o rude a Treatment po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him with, obliged him &s;eve|ral times to &s;ay with Tears in his Eyes, that God had now tryed him by throwing him into this Furnace of Tribulations, and that he &s;hould be very happy to be found good Alloy. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the Streets, he &s;aid to the People who pur&s;ued him with contumelious Reproaches, Farewel my Children, farewel, I am going.</P>
<P>He was not willing to accept of the Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Rome,</HI> altho the Queen writ a very obliging Letter to him at <HI>Fuencaral,</HI> and reiterated the Offer to him. She &s;ent him two thou&s;and Pi&s;toles for his Voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ome Precious Stones, and an Augmentation of two thou&s;and Crowns by way of Pen&s;ion. When he was gone, his Dome&s;ticks found a Hair-cloth and &s;ome Di&s;ci|plines in his Cabinet.</P>
<P>When there was now no longer any Fear of di&s;plea&s;ing the Father Confe&s;&s;or by &s;hewing re&s;pect to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> every one went to &s;ee him at <HI>Con&s;uegra,</HI> and te&s;tified their Zeal for him. He wrote to the Queen to thank her for &s;end|ing away his inveterate Enemy, as well as that of the State, and prayed her to give him leave to come to Court, and ki&s;s the Kings hands. But in&s;tead of granting him that Re|que&s;t, &s;he order'd him to retire a dozen Leagues from <HI>Madrid.</HI> He was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd at this unexpected Severity, and complained of it as of a &s;ort of Bani&s;hment. Neverthele&s;s this did not hinder him from demanding by Letters, as well to the Queen as the Council, to take the pub|lick Good into their Con&s;ideration, and fill Fa|ther <HI>Nitard</HI>'s places with per&s;ons that were capa|ble
<PB N="33" REF="40">
of di&s;charging them well: he repre&s;ented to them, that tho&s;e Dignities ought to be taken from him, &s;ince it was equally as important a matter to hinder him from coming back again into the Kingdom, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to make him leave it.</P>
<P>He demanded al&s;o that they &s;hould take away the Place of Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> from the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Placentia,</HI> &s;ince he was the man that i&s;|&s;ued out the Decree, by Virtue of which <HI>Mal|ladas</HI> was &s;trangled; and that the Marque&s;s <HI>d'Aytone,</HI> his capital Enemy, &s;hould no longer have the Liberty of pa&s;&s;ing his Judgment in tho&s;e Affairs that concerned him.</P>
<P>The Queen was very much offended at the manner wherein the Prince wrote to her, and yet more enraged at what had happened, &s;ent him a very unpallatable Me&s;&s;age, and order'd him forthwith to di&s;charge his Guards, as he had engag'd to do.</P>
<P>He complained of this to the Cardinal of <HI>Ar|ragon</HI> and the Nuncio, giving them as well as the Queen to under&s;tand, that he could not part with his Friends that accompanied him, till &s;uch time as he was certainly informed that Father <HI>Nitard</HI> was out of the Kingdom, becau&s;e he had &s;till rea&s;on to fear &s;ome Mi&s;chief from that Quarter.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Council met, and judged it convenient that the Cardinal &s;hould go to <HI>Gua|dalajara,</HI> to engage the Prince to comply with the Queens de&s;ires; he con&s;ented to it at la&s;t and di&s;mi&s;t his Guards, after the Cardinal had managed a &s;ort of a Treaty between that Prince&s;s and <HI>Don Juan,</HI> by which &s;he confirmed him in the Government of the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed her word that the Father Confe&s;&s;or &s;hould quit his places; that the Pre&s;ident of
<PB N="34" REF="41">
<HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>d'Aytone</HI> &s;hould not meddle with the Cognizance of tho&s;e things wherein the Prince was concerned; that as for him&s;elf, he might &s;ettle wherever he thought convenient; that they would take particular care to ea&s;e the People of their Grievances; that no body &s;hould be admitted to any of the Military Orders of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who had not &s;erved ten years by Land or by Sea; that the Pope &s;hould be the Depo&s;itory of the Queens word for the &s;ecurity of the Prince. There were many other Articles be&s;ides the&s;e, but not of the &s;ame weight and con&s;ideration, all tending either to the &s;atisfacti|on of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> or the ea&s;e of the People.</P>
<P>He forbore making his u&s;ual Remon&s;trances till the Month of <HI>May,</HI> at which time he recei|ved information that the Queen was &s;etting on foot a Regiment of Guards for the Kings Service, whereof &s;he had made the Marques <HI>d'Aytone</HI> Collonel.</P>
<P>He wrote very &s;harply to her about this mat|ter, and repre&s;ented to her, that it was again&s;t the Cu&s;tom of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> to have any o|ther Guards but the Inhabitants of <HI>Madrid,</HI> that this Regiment would be an everla&s;ting Reproach to the City, and would occa&s;ion abundance of ill Effects, which he there enumerated at length. It is worth the ob&s;erving, (and I could not forbear to take notice of it) that in this &s;ame Letter he complained, that the Queen did not an&s;wer him with her own Hand, but u&s;ed that of the Cardi|nal of <HI>Arragon,</HI> under pretence that &s;he was troub|led with a Megrim; telling her in plain down-right Terms, <HI>that a man of his Rank and Quality was not able to bear &s;uch a Contempt.</HI> The World may learn from this remarkable Pa&s;&s;age on what Grounds the natural Sons of the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> pretend to &s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42">
All the Courts of Judicature as well the Chief as the Subaltern, the Body of the City and the People made &s;everal Remon&s;trances to the Queen, to hinder the &s;etting up this Regiment in <HI>Madrid,</HI> but to no purpo&s;e. In fine they importuned her &s;o often upon this Score, that &s;he &s;igned an Or|der, by which &s;he prohibited them to &s;peak to her any more about it, and &s;o without any more Delay &s;he compleated the Regiment.</P>
<P>She afterwards commanded <HI>Don Juan,</HI> under very rigorous Penalties, to remove from <HI>Guada|lajara:</HI> He obeyed her Orders with a great deal of Re&s;pect, altho he was in a Condition, by the Help of his Friends, that were come to him from <HI>Arragon</HI> and other places, to do what he plea&s;ed; the Report ran, that he was coming within a little Di&s;tance of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and this gave &s;everal Per&s;ons abundance of unea&s;ie Thoughts.</P>
<P>To pacifie their Spirits, the Queen wrote to him and de&s;ired him to repair to <HI>Arragon,</HI> in the Quality of Viceroy and Vicar-General of the Kingdom dependant upon it.</P>
<P>This Order affected him with a very &s;en&s;ible Joy, and he took care to te&s;tifie it by the Thanks he returned the Queen, to whom he writ a very large Letter, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ty to con&s;ider &s;e|riou&s;ly of the Education of the young King. In it he repre&s;ented to her the great Con&s;equences of it, as being a Man, that was Ma&s;ter of a great deal of Wit and Honour. He wrote likewi&s;e to the Pope on the 7<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> to conjure him to oblige Father <HI>Nitard</HI> to quit his Offices.</P>
<P>In the mean time &s;ome of the Queens Ene|mies &s;et about a &s;ham Decree, wherein &s;he gave Orders to the Council to di&s;arm the People im|mediately, and return their Arms into the Com|mon Hall. It was an ea&s;ie matter to per&s;wade the World that this was her real Intention, and
<PB N="36" REF="43">
indeed this pretended Innovation &s;o far e&s;trang|ed the Peoples Hearts from her Maje&s;ty, that they were ju&s;t upon the point of making an in|&s;urrection.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on joyned with the horrible Di&s;or|ders that were committed by the Regiment of the <HI>Scambergues</HI> (for &s;o the People nick-named them becau&s;e they were clad <HI>a la Francoi&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> copied this Mode from M. <HI>de Schom|berg</HI>) this rea&s;on, I &s;ay, obliged the Council R&ograve;y|al to pre&s;ent another Remon&s;trance to the Queen, wherein they de&s;ired her to &s;end the&s;e new Sol|diers to the Frontiers; but &s;he did not think fit to comply with their Reque&s;ts, becau&s;e &s;he ima|gined this Body of Military Men would keep the City in Awe and Subjection.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> was now at <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> beloved by the Nobility, and adored by the People: The Queen could never forgive him the irreparable Injury he did her, in forcing her to part with her Confe&s;|&s;or, who made but a &s;orry Figure at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o that by way of Raillery it was frequently &s;aid. <HI>That the Queen of</HI> Spain <HI>had &s;o invincible an Aver&s;ion to the</HI> Spaniards<HI>, that &s;he would never con&s;ent to the Ruine of Father</HI> Nitard<HI>, till he was naturalized a</HI> Spaniard.</P>
<P>But however &s;he &s;till pre&s;erved &s;o great an E&s;teem and Affection for him, that &s;he employed her utmo&s;t Endeavours to procure him a Cardi|nals Cap. For this rea&s;on he gave &s;ecret Orders to the M&agrave;rque&s;s <HI>de S. Romain,</HI> her Amba&s;&s;ador ordinary at <HI>Rome.</HI> This &s;oon came to be known at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the News alarm'd the People ex|ceedingly, every one apprehending that if ever the Father Confe&s;&s;or was made Cardinal, he would certainly by tho&s;e Steps come back to <HI>Spain,</HI> and they were all per&s;waded that the Queen maintained the Regiment of the <HI>Schombergs</HI> for no other end, but only to favour this De&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44">
The Council being really afraid le&s;t the In|trigue &s;hould &s;ucceed, bethought them&s;elves of &s;ome means to defeat Father <HI>Nitard</HI> in his Pre|ten&s;ions, and for that purpo&s;e they di&s;patched a Courier to the Marque&s;s <HI>de S. Romain</HI> to propo&s;e to the Pope &s;ome other Subjects of <HI>Spain,</HI> who better de&s;erved the Purple. The Queen made as if &s;he con&s;ented to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, but under hand renewed her Orders: But the Amba&s;&s;ador, who was no Friend at all to the Je&s;uits, managed his Affairs &s;o prudently, that his Holine&s;s reject|ed Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> and be&s;ides obliged him to re|&s;ign his other Places.</P>
<P>The General of his Order, whom he had for|merly neglected, and who for that rea&s;on owed him a great deal of ill will, thought he had now an opportunity in the rever&s;e of the Fathers, for|tune to pay the debt, &s;o he &s;ent him immediate|ly to one of their Hou&s;es near <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>He retired thither with a Spirit of Moderation that was very exemplary, and of all his Train he kept no one with him but Friar <HI>Bu&s;tos</HI> his Companion: Behold here a continued Series of Thunder Claps one upon the Neck of another. This har&s;h U&s;age appeared &s;o terrible to the poor Queen, who did not in the lea&s;t que&s;tion the Succe&s;s of her Negotiation, that &s;he fell &s;ick of a Tertian Ague, which continued a long time upon her.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;ie to believe, by what I have already related, that her Re&s;entments became more vio|lent than ever again&s;t <HI>Don Juan:</HI> from her na|tural Di&s;po&s;ition &s;he was inclined to make him re&s;pon&s;ible for every thing that gave her a|ny Di&s;quiet, and when &s;he &s;aw at the &s;ame time the Bulls for the Charge of Inqui&s;itor Gene|ral arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;he did not doubt but it was all of the Prince's doing. In fine that place
<PB N="38" REF="45">
whieh &s;he had &s;een &s;o de&s;ervedly filled by Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by <HI>Don Antonio Balladores,</HI> Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>; and Father <HI>Nitard</HI> for his part continued &s;till near <HI>Rome,</HI> but &s;ubject to all the ill Treatment, with which the General of his Order thought fit to mortifie him.</P>
<P>The Queen was not able to endure, that a Man who had formerly enjoyed &s;o great a &s;hare in her Friend&s;hip and Confidence, and who had governed the whole Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;o ab&s;o|lutely &s;hould continue expo&s;ed to all the Re&s;ent|ments and Caprices of his General, therefore &s;he employed all the Credit &s;he had at <HI>Rome</HI> to place Father <HI>Nitard</HI> in another Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Clement</HI> IX dying in the Month of <HI>December</HI> 1669. Cardinal <HI>Altieri</HI> was cho&s;en Pope, and took upon him the name of <HI>Clement</HI> X. The Queen, who did not doubt but that this Pope would be&s;tow a Cap upon her Confe&s;&s;or, named the Father to be Emba&s;&s;ador extraordinary of <HI>Spain</HI> at his Holine&s;s's Court, an Employment which &s;he had formerly offer'd him, when he departed from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and which he was not then willing to accept of; &s;he procured leave for him to return to <HI>Rome,</HI> and in fine, managed this Affair with his Holine&s;s &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that Father <HI>Nitard</HI> was created Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Ede&s;&s;a.</HI> She continued to &s;olicit his Promotion with a great deal of Vigour and Application. The Pope being thus importuned, made him Cardinal <HI>Priest</HI> in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1672, and gave him in the Month of <HI>August</HI> following, the Title of St. <HI>Bartholomew d'I&s;ola,</HI> and gave him a place in the four Congregations.</P>
<P>This News filled the Queen with a very &s;en&s;i|ble Joy, and all tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were of her party did not fail to compliment her upon this Occa&s;ion. The new Cardinal writ a very ob|bliging
<PB N="39" REF="46">
Letter to <HI>Don Juan</HI> in hopes that this ci|vility would draw another from the Prince, and that finding by this Corre&s;pondence a means to reconcile him&s;elf to him, he would at la&s;t con&s;ent to his Return into <HI>Spain.</HI> But he was mightily mi&s;taken in his Project, for <HI>Don Juan</HI> &s;ent him no An&s;wer back again. Cardinal <HI>Nitard</HI> &s;eeing that the Prince &s;till continued his A ver&s;ion to him, laid a&s;ide all Hopes of going to <HI>Madrid,</HI> till the time of the King's Coronation.</P>
<P>But &s;ince what I have written concerning Cardinal <HI>Nitard,</HI> has in&s;en&s;ibly led me to the time of <HI>Don Fernand de Valenzuela,</HI> I think my &s;elf obliged to &s;peak of him.</P>
<P>He was originally of the City <HI>de Ronda</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Granada,</HI> and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an <HI>Hidalgo,</HI> that is to &s;ay a Gentleman, and not a <HI>Cavallero.</HI> For they make this Difference in <HI>Spain</HI> between a Cavalier and a Gentleman, that the former is de&s;cended of an ancient Family, or at lea&s;t allied to &s;ome illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, and pays neither Taxes nor Tribute, whereas the latter is exempt from nothing, tho he perhaps has ac|quired the Quality of a Gentleman.</P>
<P><HI>Valenzuela</HI> came very young to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Duke <HI>de l'Infantado</HI> took him for his Page when he went Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Rome.</HI> He was hand&s;om and well-&s;haped, of an agreeable Meen, had a great deal of Wit, loved his Studies, and was naturally a Poet. The Character of his Ver&s;e was tender and pa&s;&s;ionate, there are &s;everal pieces of his to be &s;een that are compo&s;ed after Fa&s;hion, and among the re&s;t &s;ome Comedies which he cau&s;ed to be repre&s;ented for the Di|ver&s;ion of the Queen-Mother, at the time when he fir&s;t began to have the Honour of being in her good Graces.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de l'Infantado</HI> being returned cut
<PB N="40" REF="47">
of <HI>Italy,</HI> made <HI>Don Fernand</HI> Knight of St. <HI>Jago.</HI> 'Tis by this means ordinarily that great Per&s;ons begin to recompen&s;e tho&s;e of their Dome&s;ticks, for whom they have the greate&s;t Con&s;ideration. But he received nothing el&s;e but this bare Title for the many years Service he had waited upon his Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e it &s;o happened that the Duke died, before he did any farther kindne&s;s for him.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf therefore all at a Blow de&s;ti|tute of a Protector, and &s;o mi&s;erably poor that he was obliged to become <HI>Pa&s;&s;eante en Corte,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, a man that lives by his Wits. To &s;ay the truth, he was Ma&s;ter of very happy Talents, which put him in a Condi|tion to accompli&s;h every thing he undertook, &s;o that after he had &s;eriou&s;ly examined with him&s;elf the meanne&s;s of his Fortune, he imagined the be&s;t Conduct he could u&s;e to advance it, was to make him&s;elf acquainted and known to &s;ome per&s;ons, that were particularly devoted to the Intere&s;ts of the Queen. He &s;earch'd out means to effect this De&s;ign with &s;o continued an Application, that at la&s;t he found acce&s;s to Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> he cho&s;e him immediately for his Patron, and indeed could not have pitch'd upon a better; and &s;oon in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his favour by his exem|plary Submi&s;&s;ion and Diligence. The Father taking notice that he wanted neither Addre&s;s nor Wit, and be&s;ides that he was capable of keeping a Secret, communicated to him &s;ome of his own, and afterwards entru&s;ted him with tho&s;e of the Queen, acquainting him with the Re&s;entments &s;he had entertained again&s;t <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> He knew very well what Advantages to make, both of the Di&s;covery that was made him, and of the favourable Di&s;po&s;ition of the Father Con|fe&s;&s;or, and rendred him&s;elf &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him
<PB N="41" REF="48">
that he could not almo&s;t be a Moment without him. This obliged himto give him Admi&s;&s;ion into the Palace, whether he often came to give him an account of the &s;everal things he had in|tru&s;ted him with.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever <HI>Valenzuela</HI> was introduced into the Palace, he lo&s;t no time there, but improved all his favourable Moments to the be&s;t Advanta|ges; he plaid very well at Cards, and being in|formed that among&s;t the other Women that waited upon the Queen, there was a <HI>German</HI> Lady who&s;e name was <HI>Donna Eugenia,</HI> in whom her Mi&s;tre&s;s intirely confided, he pre&s;ently re&s;olved to u&s;e all means to &s;ee her: He walked often under her Chamber window, and being an hand&s;om agreea|ble young Fellow &s;he for her part failed not to take due Notice of him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort they &s;poke to one another, he plea&s;ed her at lea&s;t as well as &s;he plea&s;ed him, &s;he gave him leave to <HI>Galantear</HI> her, for that is the fa&s;hio|nable Word with them there, when any Per&s;on devotes him&s;elf to the Service of any of the Court-Ladies: And 'tis a thing &s;o common among them, that altho a Man is married, yet he does not for|bear to treat his Mi&s;tre&s;s in publick with all tho&s;e Ceremonies, that are u&s;ually paid to the Lady, whom they de&s;ign to marry.</P>
<P><HI>Donna Eugenia</HI> did not receive the Te&s;timonies, that young <HI>Valenzuela</HI> gave her of his Pa&s;&s;ion with the lea&s;t coldne&s;s or indifference, and he pur&s;ued the point &s;o vigorou&s;ly, and pre&s;s'd her &s;o earn|e&s;tly to con&s;ent to marry him, that &s;he di&s;cour&s;|ed the Queen about it.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty had already taken Notice of him, and he had the good Fortune not to di&s;plea&s;e her, &s;o that to tye him the fa&s;ter to her Intere&s;ts &s;he con&s;ented to let him marry her Favourite, and afterwards be&s;towed a Gentleman Querry's place
<PB N="42" REF="49">
upon the new Bridegroom, About this time the Differences between the Queen and <HI>Don Juan</HI> daily increa&s;ed, and as <HI>Don Fernand</HI> was a Man of Addre&s;s enough to &s;ound the Bottom of any In|trigue, &s;o he did not omit to do the Queen all the u&s;eful Services that lay in his Power. She beheld his Zeal with a great deal of Plea&s;ure, and took him &s;o far into her Con&s;ideration, that &s;he daily gave him &s;ome fre&s;h A&s;&s;urances of her Con|fidence.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Nitard</HI> placed all this to his own Ac|count, and voluntarily contributed to <HI>Valenzuela</HI>'s Advancement, becau&s;e he looked upon him as his own Creature: But tho Fortune now began to de&s;ert and leave him, yet &s;he ab&s;olutely de|clared her &s;elf in Favour of <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> about the time when <HI>Don Juan</HI> returned from <HI>Arragon</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and cau&s;ed the Father Confe&s;&s;or to be turned out of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Valenzuela</HI> continued the Queen's &s;ole Favou|rite without any Spy upon him, for the Prince returned back to <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a</HI> in Quality of Vicar-General of the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon.</HI> The Queen was &s;o extremely perplexed and mortified by the Removal of Father <HI>Nitard,</HI> and her Enemies knew &s;o well to make their Advantages of it, that it was &s;ome time before &s;he could tolerably reco|ver her&s;elf from the Impre&s;&s;ion that &s;o rude a Shock had made upon her, but having con&s;i|dered the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he lay under to have a faith|ful Per&s;on near her, whom &s;he might entru&s;t with her mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs, &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes upon <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> who for his part &s;till continued very much amaz'd at the Misfortunes of Father <HI>Nitard.</HI></P>
<P>One day the Queen &s;poke to <HI>Donna Eugenia</HI> to bring her Husband with her privately towards the Evening, becau&s;e &s;he had a mind to di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="50">
with him alone: <HI>Donna Eugenia,</HI> who wanted neither Wit nor Ambition, was tran&s;ported with Joy to think that <HI>Valenzuela</HI> was going to have &s;uch particular Conver&s;ations with the Queen, and exactly obeyed the Orders &s;he had received.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time he entred into the Queen's Chamber, he was very cautious and fearful, for he came armed with a <HI>Broquel,</HI> which is a &s;ort of a Buckler, that they generally carry with them in <HI>Spain,</HI> when they go to a place where they apprehend any Danger: His Hair, that was very fine and delicate, he had tyed up in a Rib|bon knot, he had not his <HI>Golilia</HI> on, for 'tis the fa&s;hion there to leave them off at night, in &s;hort he forgot nothing that might render him&s;elf charming and agreeable to the Queen. She appeared in a <HI>de&s;habille</HI> that &s;at much better upon her, than the Widows Habit &s;he wore in the day time, which very much re&s;embles that of a religious Woman.</P>
<P><HI>Velanzuela</HI> threw him&s;elf immediately at her feet, and after he had returned her his mo&s;t humble Thanks for the great Honour &s;he was now plea&s;ed to do him, he a&s;&s;ured her, that his Blood, his Life, in a word every thing that lay in his Power was &s;o intirely re&s;igned to her Ser|vice, that he had the Pre&s;umption to believe none of all her Subjects was devoted to her Maje&s;ty, after &s;o particular a manner as him&s;elf. The Queen gave credit to his words, and after this meeting, &s;carce a night pa&s;s'd over his Head, but &s;he cau&s;ed him to come privately to her A|partment</P>
<P>His Wife always conducted him thither, and the Queen ordered her to be pre&s;ent all the while to take away all Su&s;pition and Umbrage. Hereit was that he gave her a particular Account of every thing he knew, and informed her of
<PB N="44" REF="51">
all the mo&s;t &s;ecret Intrigues that were carried on in Court or City, of the De&s;igns of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> of tho&s;e Lords that were of the Prince's Faction, of the Mea&s;ures that were taken again&s;t her, &s;o that &s;he knew all the mo&s;t private Affairs, altho to appearance &s;he &s;poke with no body. It was commonly &s;aid at Court that there was a <HI>Duende</HI> in the Palace, that is to &s;ay a familiar Spirit, that acquainted the Queen with all the News, and and &s;ecret De&s;igns: But &s;ome time after when it came to be publickly known, that <HI>Valenzuela</HI> was this <HI>E&s;prit folet,</HI> this familiar Spirit, he was u&s;ually called <HI>el Duende de la Reina.</HI></P>
<P>The Affection &s;he had for him encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree, that all the World knew it, and the Courtiers all endeavoured to plea&s;e the new Favourite: No Favours were to be obtained but through his Interce&s;&s;ion, and the Credit of the o|ther Mini&s;ters &s;unk &s;olow that they &s;tood only for Ciphers, So they began to murmur among&s;t them&s;elves. <HI>To what purpo&s;e was it,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>to remove Father</HI> Nitard <HI>and &s;end him away, &s;ince a new Favourite is &s;tarted up, that &s;ucceeds him in his Place, and acts with more Authority than the other ever did?</HI></P>
<P>This good Fortune of <HI>Valenzuela</HI> occa&s;ioned him a thou&s;and Enemies, they &s;poke of the Queen with all the Freedom and Liberty imaginable; both Grandees and People made no Scruple of &s;aying in publick that a young ignorant Favou|rite without Fortune or Merit governed all <HI>Spain,</HI> and that it was a Shame to endure it. The Queen being informed of what was &s;aid, re&s;olved to advance <HI>Valenzuela</HI>'s fortune without delay, to the end that he might feel the good Effects of her Protection, before they were able to hurt him. Upon this Con&s;ideration &s;he gave him the charge of Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, without having any
<PB N="45" REF="52">
regard to the Cu&s;tom, by which &s;he was obliged to concert it with her Mini&s;ters, as is the way in <HI>Spain,</HI> when they are going to di&s;po&s;e of any con&s;iderable Po&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he apprehended they would have oppo&s;ed her De&s;igns; &s;o that with|out entring into any matter of Con&s;ultation (that is the u&s;ual Term in <HI>Spain</HI>) &s;he ordered his Com|mi&s;&s;ion to be di&s;patched.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Ca&s;tel-Rodrigo</HI> who was at that time Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, oppo&s;ed it with all his Power, and peremptorily refu&s;ed to give him Admi&s;&s;ion into that Place, alledging abun|dance of very di&s;obliging Rea&s;ons again&s;t the Preten&s;ions of <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and particularly that he had no Title to make him hope &s;o great an Honour. The Queen removed that Difficulty very ea&s;ily, for &s;he created him Marque&s;s <HI>de San|bortolome de los Pinares.</HI></P>
<P>When the World ob&s;erved &s;o advantageous an Alteration in the Fortune of <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> no bo|dy que&s;tioned but that he was a <HI>Valido,</HI> that is to &s;ay a Favourite. The Report immediately &s;pread it &s;elf through all <HI>Spain,</HI> attended with &s;ome Circum&s;tances that deeply concerned her Maje&s;ty's Reputation, but &s;he made no Account of them; whether it were, becau&s;e &s;he thought tho&s;e Per&s;ons not worth her Con&s;ideration that had the Boldne&s;s to talk &s;o freely of her, or be|cau&s;e &s;he had &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons to her&s;elf not to alter this Conduct.</P>
<P>Some time after, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Ca&s;tel-Ro|drigo,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, happened to die, and the Queen be&s;tow'd his Charge upon <HI>Va|lenzuela:</HI> if the Grandees formerly murmured when he was advanced to a le&s;s con&s;iderable Po&s;t, 'tis an ea&s;ie matter to imagine the Exce&s;s of their Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Jealou&s;ie, when they beheld him &s;ettled in a place, which all of them
<PB N="46" REF="53">
could have wi&s;hed to have enjoyed, and of which they believed them&s;elves to be infinitely more de&s;erving: But they cea&s;ed to make any farther Clamours about this Bu&s;ine&s;s, when they found they had a Subject to talk of that was a great deal more &s;urprizing. Her Maje&s;ty made <HI>Valenzuela</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI> of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s, with a double gold Key. At this piece of news all people looked upon one another, and conti|nued mute for &s;ome time, not being able to ex|pre&s;s the A&s;toni&s;hment they were in. The Lords as they met one another &s;aid nothing el&s;e but, <HI>Valenzuela made a Grandee, O tempora, O mo|res:</HI> In fine the Queen declared him her &s;ole Fa|vourite, &s;o that he i&s;&s;ued out all Orders for her as chief Mini&s;ter, or to &s;peak more properly, as an ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter. No Body was &s;urprized at this new Honour that arrived to him, for they made no Que&s;tion, but that after &s;uch &s;trange unaccountable Beginnings, he was marked out and de&s;igned for the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Being elevated to &s;o eminent a po&s;t, he want|ed nothing but &s;ome Friends to help and &s;upport him, if it ever &s;hould be his ill Fortune to make a wrong Step. And it was no difficult Matter for him to effect it in &s;o advantageous a Situation, where all Favours, all the Mony, all the Offices and Benefices were at his intire Di&s;po&s;al. But as &s;oon as ever he procured a Favour for any &s;ingle Grandee, he at the &s;ame Moment di&s;obliged above twenty more, who from that time dated them&s;elves his mortal Enemies, and heartily wi&s;hed his Ruin, becau&s;e he did not prefer them: So that he was often heard to complain and regret his Fate, for that he could not &s;atisfie all the World. And as the Number of his Friends was infinitely inferiour to that of his Enemies, &s;o the latter began to
<PB N="47" REF="54">
cabal again&s;t him, and think of &s;ome way or o|ther to oblige <HI>Don Juan</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> to return, out of an Expectation that he was the fitte&s;t per|&s;on to remove this univer&s;al Grievance, this new Creature <HI>Valenzuela.</HI></P>
<P>This Cabal of Malecontents increa&s;ed &s;o mightily, that there was almo&s;t nothing to be &s;een but Pa&s;quils, Lampoons, and Satyrs, both in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e again&s;t the Queen and again&s;t him. Nay they had the boldne&s;s to give out, that he hindered her Maje&s;ty from recompen|cing the Services of &s;everal Per&s;ons, who other|wi&s;e might have expected con&s;iderable Employ|ments. In &s;hort, their in&s;olence proceeded &s;o far, that one Night very near the Palace, they hung up the Portraiture of the Queen with <HI>Valen|zuela.</HI> He had at his feet all the Marks that re|pre&s;ented his &s;everal places, a Sword for Con|&s;table, an Anchor for Admiral, a Golden Key for Gentleman of the Bed Chamber, a Collar of the Fleece for Knight of that Order, and &s;o of the re&s;t. He pointed at all the&s;e things with his hand, and below was written <HI>E&s;te &s;e Vende,</HI> that is to &s;ay, all this is &s;old. And the Queen leaning her Hand upon his Heart with this In|&s;cription <HI>Ye&s;te &s;e da,</HI> that is to &s;ay, and this is given. The Report ran very &s;trong, that he &s;old all Offices and Dignities at high Rates, at which &s;ome Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality were extremely offended, and his Avarice drew upon him abundance of Enemies.</P>
<P>But what is &s;till the mo&s;t remarkable is this, that all the&s;e various Reports made not the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on the Queen. She &s;aid <Q REND="inline">That her rank placed her above the&s;e little Contumelies, and that &s;he &s;hould be angry with her &s;elf if &s;he were capable of being di&s;quieted at &s;uch mi&s;erable Reproaches, that were &s;o infinitely
<PB N="48" REF="55">
below her indignation; that the mo&s;t effectual way to puni&s;h and extingui&s;h the&s;e licentious Abu&s;es was to take no notice of them, that the rea&s;on why they were &s;o inveterate again&s;t the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valenzuela</HI> proceeded only from their Envie, that &s;he was re&s;olved not to aban|don and &s;acrifice one of the be&s;t Subjects that the King her Son had, to gratifie the in&s;atiable Humour of &s;ome Malecontents that were never to be &s;atisfied.</Q> So that now it was apparent, that all the Methods they took to de&s;troy this Favourite, &s;erved only to confirm him &s;o much the deeper in the Affections, and good Graces of the Queen.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Means to procure the good Will of the People, he took care that <HI>Madrid</HI> &s;hould be always plentifully &s;up|plied with Provi&s;ions, nece&s;&s;ary for Life; and that all &s;orts of Commodities &s;hould be &s;old at cheap ea&s;ie Rates. He often entertained the City with Bull-Fea&s;ts, where he generally made his Appearance in a black Habit, embroidered over with Silver, and wore black and white Plumes, as being in &s;econd Mourning, becau&s;e the Queen was a Widow: But as &s;oon as ever he entred the Li&s;ts, and according to the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e that de&s;ign to combat the Bulls, came under the Queen's Balcony making her a profound Reverence and demanding Permi&s;&s;ion <HI>de Taurear,</HI> (as they call it there) &s;he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to forbid him to expo&s;e him&s;elf. 'Twas ob&s;erva|ble in one of the&s;e Cour&s;es, that he wore a Scarf of black Taffata embroidered o're with Gold, with the Device of an Eagle gazing &s;tedfa&s;tly upon the Sun, and for the Motto the&s;e words&punc; <HI>Tengo &s;olo Licentia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is only permit|ted to me.</HI> Some days after he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">eared at the running at the Ring, having an Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> painted up
<PB N="49" REF="56">
on his Buckler, (for they always wear them at this &s;ort of Cour&s;e, which is an ancient Diver&s;ion of the <HI>Moors</HI>) armed with <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Thunder, bear|ing the &s;ame Motto, <HI>It is only permitted to me.</HI> There being no hazard to run in this Sport, the Queen was willing that <HI>Valenzuela</HI> &s;hould &s;hew his Dexterity, which he did, and carried away the Prize from a great number of young Lords, that di&s;puted it with him, and received from the Queen's hand a Sword be&s;et with Diamonds. They talked hotly at Court of the two Devices of the Favourite, and every one was ready to explain them according to his own Fancy and In|clination. He cau&s;ed &s;ome Comedies of his compo&s;ing to be publickly repre&s;ented on the Theatre, and all the Town had the liberty of &s;eeing them for nothing. This was the mo&s;t taking way in the World to gain the hearts of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for they are &s;uch pa&s;&s;ionate Admi|rers of all publick Shows, that they will lay up the Mony, which ought to be &s;pent in maintain|ing their poor Families, to purcha&s;e a dear Seat at a Bull-fea&s;t. <HI>Valenzuela</HI> was not &s;atisfied to cultivate the Affections of the people by the&s;e magnificences, but &s;ought other ways to win their hearts. He &s;et &s;everal noble Buildings on foot, rebuilt the great Square, the better part of which had been con&s;umed by Fire, and particularly the Hou&s;e where their Maje&s;ties went to behold the Cour&s;es at the Bull-fea&s;ts, and running at the Ring. He cau&s;ed a Bridge to be built at the gate near <HI>Toledo</HI> over the <HI>Mancanares,</HI> that co&s;t a million of Ducats, and another Bridge over the &s;ame River at <HI>Pardo,</HI> which is a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure belonging to the King. The Fronti&s;piece and place before the Palace was fini&s;hed by his order, as al&s;o the Tower of the Queen's Apartment was rai&s;ed much higher.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57">
He employed all his Thoughts in contributing to the diver&s;ion of the Queen, and the King her Son; this young Prince now began to go to all the meetings of Sport and Plea&s;ure that were kept at <HI>Aranjues,</HI> the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> and the other Royal Hou&s;es. One day when the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valenzuela</HI> had received Orders of the King to prepare a Cha&s;e for him, and the Court was then at the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> the King de&s;igning to &s;hoot a Stag, &s;hot his Favourite and wounded him on the Thigh; the Queen being terribly affrighted broke out into great Lamentations, and fainted away between the Arms of her Ladies. This accident occa&s;ioned &s;ome People to predict the approaching Ruin of <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> whereof this odd Adventure &s;eemed to be a Pre&s;age.</P>
<P>The time being now come to order the King's Hou&s;hold, the Marque&s;s made choice of all the Officers, he made the Duke <HI>d'Albuquerque</HI> Mayor <HI>Dome</HI> Mayor, the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile, Cavalleri|zo</HI> Mayor, and the Duke <HI>de Medinacelli Sumiller de Corps,</HI> this Officer is the &s;ame in Effect with High Chamberlain, and puts on the Kings Shirt: The name is originally French, and comes from the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> from whom the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> is de&s;cended. After the &s;ame manner he di&s;po&s;ed of the other places.</P>
<P>Now as there were abundantly more Pretend|ers than places to fill, he drew upon him by this means a con&s;iderable number of Enemies, who could not dige&s;t the Affront of having nothing given them, and were le&s;s inclined to Pardon him for that which directly concerned them&s;elves, than for what related to the Intere&s;t of State. At this time they thought more earne&s;tly than ever of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> hoping that he would come to re|venge their Quarrel upon <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> and be&s;ides they laboured under hand to convince the
<PB N="51" REF="58">
King, how nece&s;&s;ary it was for the better Ma|nagement of Affairs to have the Prince about him.</P>
<P>The Queen being informed of what was de|&s;igned again&s;t her, pa&s;&s;ed many &s;orrowful Days, and more melancholy Nights, altho &s;he had almo&s;t continual Conference with the Marque&s;s; but &s;he could never repre&s;ent to her mind the killing thought, that they would treat the Marque&s;s af|ter the &s;ame cruel manner as they had u&s;ed Fa|ther <HI>Nitard,</HI> but &s;he fell a weeping, and di&s;co|vered all the Signs of a real Concern. She knew very well, that the Grandees frequently a&s;&s;em|bled together, and that they &s;poke of the Govern|ment with all the freedom imaginable; that the Libels and Pa&s;quils, that were in&s;olently &s;cattered abroad, all tended to Defame her Ad|mini&s;tration, were publickly owned and acknow|ledged by the Authors them&s;elves, and that &s;he was obliged to &s;eem, as if &s;he knew nothing of tho&s;e matters, becau&s;e &s;he was not in a Capacity to puni&s;h them.</P>
<P><HI>Valenzuela</HI> for his part was not without his un|ea&s;ie Moments, the Elevation of his Fortune only &s;erved to make him &s;en&s;ible of the terrible Pre|cipice he was falling down, from which he did not perceive any vi&s;ible means to &s;ecure him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Don Juan,</HI> who continued &s;till at <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> was di&s;contented at his Bani&s;h|ment, how honourable &s;oever it appeared, it is &s;ufficient that it was not voluntary, and that was enough to make him di&s;reli&s;h it. The Queen and he had &s;till the &s;ame natural Aver&s;ion to one another as formerly, and notwith&s;tanding the fair Appearances of his outward Behaviour, he laboured underhand with his Friends to get him&s;elf declared, Infant <HI>de Ca&s;tile.</HI> At lea&s;t people report it of him; 'tis indeed very true, that he was never able to accompli&s;h that De&s;ign, but
<PB N="52" REF="59">
they pretend that he was not ab&s;olutely without hopes to effect it.</P>
<P>However it was, he made &s;o great a Faction, by the means of &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;ons about the King, who were for promoting his Return, that his Friends &s;ent him word, that the King de&s;ired it, that every thing was di&s;po&s;ed, and ready to receive him, and that the credit of the Queen would never be able to &s;tand in Competi|tion again&s;t his.</P>
<P>This good news obliged him to quit <HI>Arragon,</HI> and make all the ha&s;te he could to arrive at <HI>Buen|retiro</HI> 1677.</P>
<P>To bring about this Affair with more Facility, they gave the King to under&s;tand, <Q REND="inline">That he was not only under the Tutorage of the Queen his Mother, but under that of <HI>Valenzuela.</HI> They afterwards repre&s;ented to him the Con&s;traint he lived under in &s;uch lively Colours, that he prote&s;ted he would free him&s;elf immediately from this Servitude.</Q> And altho the Queen had always her Eye upon him, for fear he &s;hould be &s;educed by any ill Coun&s;els, and take contrary mea&s;ures to what &s;he pre&s;cribed him, yet he found the opportunity one night to &s;teal out of the Palace with only one Gentleman of his Bed|chamber, who lay in his Room, and &s;o muffled up in his Cloak he walk'd on foot to <HI>Retiro,</HI> which was far enough off: From thence he di&s;patch'd an Order immediately to the Queen not to &s;tir out of the Palace.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to imagine what Entertainment &s;uch mortifying news found with her, and what Ef|fects this &s;udden rever&s;e of Fortune cau&s;ed in a Prince&s;s, who had been accu&s;tomed to govern.</P>
<P>She employed the remainder of the night in writing to the King, conjuring him in the mo&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="60">
tender Terms to give her leave to vi&s;it him, but he &s;till refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>While the King tarried at <HI>Retiro,</HI> the people being informed of his Intentions, flock'd in Mul|titudes to &s;alute and acknowledge him. All the Lords of the Court made him very con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents, &s;o that &s;ome Per&s;ons valued them at a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, either in Mony, Plate, Tapi&s;try or Diamonds. There was an univer&s;al Joy at <HI>Madrid</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, and that for the&s;e two rea&s;ons, which equally cau&s;ed it. The fir&s;t is, the exceeding Affection the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have for their Prince, the &s;econd, becau&s;e the Queen was &s;o ill beloved, and be&s;ides the People could never forget &s;ome words that drop'd from her once, viz. <HI>That &s;he &s;hould never be at rest, till &s;he had brought them all to be cloathed with E&s;tera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> This is a &s;ort of a cour&s;e Matt made of Ru&s;hes, that &s;erves them for Mattre&s;&s;es and their Bedding.</P>
<P>The next night after the King's Retreat, they made Illuminations in all the Streets.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Don Juan</HI> arrived, he obliged the King to remove the Queen from thence, &s;o &s;he was &s;ent to <HI>Toledo,</HI> with po&s;itive orders not to &s;tir out of that City. The unfortunate <HI>Valenzuela</HI> took his Leave of her with all the Te&s;timonies of Grief and Duty, that &s;o &s;hort a time would allow him, and retired to the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> according to order.</P>
<P>Thus there being a new face of Affairs, every body made his Court and Application to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and the King by his extraordinary Care&s;&s;es, &s;uffi|ciently te&s;tified how joyful he was to &s;ee him a|gain. He commanded him to take care of all his Affairs, and indeed <HI>Don Juan</HI> rendred him&s;elf &s;o ab&s;olute a Ma&s;ter, that his Authority became much greater than that of the Queen, and her two chief Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">
<HI>Don Juan</HI> earne&s;tly de&s;ired to have <HI>Valenzuela</HI>'s per&s;on in his Power, but could not tell whither he was gone. At la&s;t being informed that he was to be found at the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> he &s;hewed a great deal of Joy at the news. This is one of the King's Hou&s;es, and is of &s;o prodigious an ex|tent, that if we take in the Buildings, the Park, and a Convent of Religious <HI>Jeronomits,</HI> which is contained within the Precincts of it, 'tis thought it is &s;everal Leagues in compa&s;s, and is all inclo&s;ed with Walls.</P>
<P>The King commanded <HI>Don Antonio de Toledo,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> to go thither in per&s;on and arre&s;t <HI>Valenzuela</HI>; he departed immediately with the Duke <HI>De Medina Sidonia,</HI> and the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Valpa ray&s;o, Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> &s;everal per&s;ons of great quality, and two hundred Hor&s;e. The Marque&s;s was then walking in an adjoyning Forre&s;t full of Heavine&s;s and Melancholy, but hearing on a &s;udden a great noi&s;e about him, and being informed at the &s;ame time, of what had happened, by a certain Me&s;&s;enger, whom &s;ome of his Friends had &s;ent in all &s;peed to acquaint him with the News; he returned ha&s;tily to the <HI>F&s;curial</HI>; and finding out the Prior of the Con|vent of the <HI>Jeronomites,</HI> who was a very hone&s;t man, and particularly concerned at the misfor|tunes of this Favourite, he told him in a few words what danger he was in, and what rea&s;ons he had to apprehend the lo&s;s of his Life, in ca&s;e he was taken; praying and conjuring him with all imaginable earne&s;tne&s;s to conceal him in &s;ome place of Safety.</P>
<P>The Prior immediately ordered a Hole to be contrived in a Cell, belonging to one of the Re+ligious, of who&s;e Confidence he was well a&s;&s;u+red: This Cell it &s;eems was all over Wain&s;coted, &s;o that taking down one of the Pannels of the
<PB N="55" REF="62">
Wain&s;cot, and making a Cavity in the Wall which was of a con&s;iderable Thickne&s;s, in man|ner of a Nitch, they threw in a few Mats, and there the poor Marque&s;s was &s;hut up.</P>
<P>It being very well known, that the Marque&s;s was retired into the Convent, there was no place or corner left un&s;earch'd by <HI>Don Antonio de Tole|do,</HI> and tho&s;e that accompanied him. They had &s;o &s;mall a re&s;pect to the mo&s;t holy places, that they almo&s;t turned every thing in the Church up&s;ide down.</P>
<P>But their Search was to no purpo&s;e; and <HI>Don Antonio</HI> could not tell what to re&s;olve upon. He had been upon the hunt there &s;everal days to find out <HI>Valenzuela,</HI> who, as he now began to ima|gine, had certainly found the means to &s;ave him&s;elf: When the unhappy Marque&s;s being almo&s;t &s;tifled in the Hole for want of Air, and be&s;ides di&s;ordered with his late Afflictions, fell &s;o dangerou&s;ly ill, that there were little hopes of his Life. Finding him&s;elf therefore in this de|&s;parate Condition, he cared not what became of him: But the Father Prior having fir&s;t taken the Chirurgion of the Convent's word to keep the &s;ecret inviolably, &s;ent him to the Marque&s;s to let him Blood: This treacherous Villain within a quarter of an hour after di&s;covered the whole My&s;tery to <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> who had been it &s;eems in the Cell, where poor <HI>Valenzuela</HI> lay immured, almo&s;t every day &s;ince he began to make the Search after him. He then immediately entred the Convent, and all on the &s;udden commanded the Pannel, which covered the Marque&s;s, to be taken down. He found him fa&s;t a&s;leep: But very much altered by his Indi&s;po&s;ition and Mis|fortunes; his Arms lay ready by him, and if he had been awake, there is no que&s;tion to be made but that he had re&s;olutely defended
<PB N="56" REF="63">
him&s;elf, being a per&s;on of great Courage and Bravery: And be&s;ides what would not a man attempt in &s;o deplorable a Condition?</P>
<P>He was conducted to the Ca&s;tle <HI>de Con&s;uegra,</HI> which belongs to the Grand Priory of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> of the order of <HI>Malta. Don Juan</HI> cho&s;e to make this the Scene of his Confinement, becau&s;e the Ca&s;tle depended upon him. <HI>Valenzuela</HI> lay there dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, and often &s;aid in the hearing of his Guards, <HI>Oh Heavens! and there is no hope then that I &s;hall die immediately, must I &s;till live after I have endured &s;o many Afflictions?</HI></P>
<P>When he was &s;omewhat better, he was re|moved to the Ca&s;tle <HI>de los Puntales</HI> at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where he &s;uffered a very clo&s;e Impri&s;onment; neverthele&s;s he &s;hewed a great deal of Con&s;tancy and Re&s;olution, in the mid&s;t of all his ill U&s;age and Di&s;graces.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he was imbarked in a Ve&s;&s;el to be &s;ent to <HI>Chile</HI> in the <HI>Philippines.</HI> The&s;e are certain I&s;lands in the extreame&s;t Part of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> almo&s;t adjoyning to <HI>China.</HI> 'Tis a long~ and tedious Voyage thither, and they generally tran&s;port their mo&s;t notorious Criminals in <HI>Spain</HI> to tho&s;e Places, where they are forced to work in the Quick&s;ilver mines. They &s;eldom tarry above two years in that &s;lavi&s;h Employment but they die, or at lea&s;t are troubled with a general trem|bling in their Limbs, which makes them &s;uffer infinitely more than Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Valenzuela</HI> was informed before his Departure, that he was degraded from all his Honours, and that the King had taken away all his Offices, leaving only his bare name to him. <HI>I perceive then,</HI> &s;ays he very pen&s;ively, <HI>that I am under more unfortunate Circum&s;tances by far, than when I first came to Court, and the Duke</HI> de l'Infantado <HI>took me for his Page.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="64">
But tho they took care to acquaint him with what related particularly to him&s;elf, yet he could learn nothing of the Queen's De&s;tiny, or what became of his Wife and Children. They had &s;hut up her Maje&s;ty together with them in a Convent at <HI>Talavera de la Reine,</HI> and &s;trictly com|manded the Abbe&s;s, not to let them &s;tir abroad, or &s;peak to any body.</P>
<P>'Tis commonly reported, that at the time, when he was at the Port of <HI>Cales</HI> ready to em|barque, a woman of an extraordinary &s;ize, hand|&s;omly dre&s;s'd, and covered with her Veil, as it is the Spani&s;h Fa&s;hion, bu&s;tled through the Guards clo&s;e up to him. <HI>Take courage</HI> Valenzuela, &s;ays &s;he to him, <HI>thy Enemy will die, and thou &s;halt once more &s;ee</HI> Spain.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that heard her &s;ay &s;o, would have &s;top'd her, but &s;he found out means to make her E&s;cape. What &s;he told him afterwards proved in Effect to be true, for <HI>Don Juan</HI> died, and one of the fir&s;t Graces that the Queen-Mo|ther begged of the King at her Return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> was to have <HI>Valenzuela</HI> recalled home. So a Ve&s;&s;el was &s;ent to the <HI>Philippines</HI> to bring him back, but he found to his &s;orrow, that <HI>d'Eguya</HI> hindered his return, altho the Queen &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>The Pope having received Information of what had pa&s;&s;ed, as well in the Church as in the Convent, when they dragged <HI>Valenzuela</HI> by force out of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> excommunicated all tho&s;e that were concerned in the Fact; &s;o that before the Lords could prevail to have the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ure taken off, which by this Vi|olation of the Churches Liberty they had incur|red, they were obliged in white Sheets and Halters about their Necks to walk to the Im|perial Colledge, where Cardinal <HI>Mellini,</HI> who
<PB N="58" REF="65">
was then Nuncio at <HI>Madrid,</HI> made each of them undergo &s;ome Blows of Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>All the Kingdom te&s;tified an extraordinary Satisfaction to &s;ee <HI>Don Juan</HI> enter upon the Go|vernment, and we may &s;afely &s;ay, that all the Hopes and Expectations of <HI>Spain</HI> were lodged in him.</P>
<P>As he was Ma&s;ter of a great deal of Wit and Vivacity, &s;o it was natural to believe that the different Employments of his Life, whether in Peace or War, rendred him extreamly capa|ble of repairing the Breaches and reforming all the Irregularities of the State. Several of the Grandees had entred into a &s;ort of an A&s;&s;ocia|tion for his Return: and now they had lei&s;ure to make &s;evere Reflections upon the weakne&s;s of the late Government, where they found nothing but private Intreagues and little Factions, that were extremely di&s;advantageous to the Publick Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>A German Queen, an Infant King, a Foreigner Chief Mini&s;ter of State and Confe&s;&s;or, <HI>Valen|zuela</HI> made a Favourite and Mini&s;ter; without Birth and without Capacity, rai&s;ed upon the &s;ud|den by a &s;trange Caprice of Fortune, and thrown down again into his primitive Nothing: In fine, all their hopes centred in <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and they had long expected him almo&s;t to a Degree of Impatience: But when he was once arrived, and they beheld him at a nearer View, pre&s;ently all tho&s;e great and glorious Ideas, which they had conceived of him, vani&s;hed away like a Dream.</P>
<P>This is commonly the Fate and De&s;tiny of all great Mini&s;ters; the high place they po&s;&s;e&s;s, only &s;erves to expo&s;e them the more to the Envy of their Inferiours. Even tho&s;e per&s;ons that took the greate&s;t Pains to place them in that Conditi|on, think they have laboured all the while for
<PB N="59" REF="66">
an ungrateful Wretch, and if he fails to &s;hower down all his Favours upon them, will be &s;ure to give him le&s;s quarter than any men el&s;e. So &s;mall a di&s;tance there is from publick Favour and Admiration to publick Hatred. This Rule which generally holds at all times and in all places, did not fail to be accompli&s;hed in the per|&s;on of <HI>Don Juan.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t people were concerned to &s;ee what har&s;h U&s;age he gave the Queen, and could not forbear to accu&s;e his Ob&s;tinacy, for refu&s;ing to enter <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> till the Queen was gone out, and on her way to <HI>Toledo.</HI></P>
<P>He was not content with this Affront that he put upon her at his fir&s;t Appearance, but to hum|ble her &s;till the more, he added another that was full as mortifying, he de&s;cended into a &s;evere Examination of her pa&s;t Conduct, the parti|culars of which had the lea&s;t Relation to the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, and only tended to de|fame her.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s &s;uffered with an incredible Grief a Treatment &s;o unbe&s;itting her high Quali|ty, and &s;o injurious to her Reputation, but all other ways of &s;hewing her Re&s;entments were de|nied her, and &s;he had nothing left to exerci&s;e &s;ave only her Patience and Virtue.</P>
<P>But &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality that were &s;till linked to her, whether out of Affection or Duty, could not without a &s;en&s;ible Affliction, behold the Oppre&s;&s;ion &s;he lay under. They generally &s;poke of it with Heat and Indignation, and &s;pread abroad a Report, that altho <HI>Don Juan</HI> was no legitimate Prince, yet he flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould one day become ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of the Monarchy.</P>
<P>Abundance of people maintained the contra|ry, alledging that he was never guilty of &s;uch a
<PB N="60" REF="67">
De&s;ign, and that if he had been capable of har|bouring any &s;uch thoughts, he might ea&s;ily have &s;ucceeded in them, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his own Party which was very numerous, and by his own Power; that the King was but fifteen years old, and be&s;ides was equally de&s;titute of Authority and Experience.</P>
<P>What occa&s;ion'd this Su&s;picion was his e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of &s;ome Innovations that were never practi&s;ed by any Mini&s;ter before him. One that made the greate&s;t noi&s;e was this, that in his Chamber of Audience he would never give the right Hand nor a Seat to the Amba&s;&s;adors. At fir&s;t they &s;hewed them&s;elves extreamly di&s;obliged at it, but at la&s;t the Nuncio and the other foreign Mini|&s;ters &s;ubmitted to this Rule, and vi&s;ited him without Difficulty. The Queen's Creatures made a greater bu&s;tle about this affair than even the Amba&s;&s;adors them&s;elves, who were only concerned in it, and whether they di&s;cour&s;ed of it with too much freedom, or <HI>Don Juan</HI> only &s;u&s;pected their private Sentiments, he cau&s;ed &s;e|veral of them to be bani&s;hed. Among the re&s;t were the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> the Duke <HI>de O&s;&s;one,</HI> the Prince <HI>de Stillano,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era,</HI> the Count <HI>d'Humanez,</HI> the Count <HI>d'Aquillar,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Mondejar.</HI> The la&s;t of whom was accu&s;ed for making the following Ver&s;es, but they were mi&s;taken in the Author, for they were written by the Admiral, who was a per&s;on of extraordinary Wit.</P>

<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> found the&s;e Ver&s;es upon his Toil|lette, and in &s;everal other places of his Cham|ber; he was more concerned at them, than in rea&s;on he ought to be, for certainly he could ne|ver be &s;o vain as to imagine that he was equally acceptable to all the World. The&s;e Re&s;entments having &s;owred and exa&s;perated his Spirit, he ob&s;erved that the Conver&s;ation of the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI> diverted the King; this was enough to render him &s;u&s;pected; and altho this Noble|man had &s;et him&s;elf at the Head of a Party, which declared for the Princes Return, yet all his Ser|vices were forgot, and the Prejudices of Jealou|&s;ie, which are &s;ometimes too head&s;trong to be ma&s;tered, made <HI>Don Juan</HI> &s;end him to command in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>He afterwards bani&s;hed him, and what is more, ordered a Trial to be commenced again&s;t him about the affair of <HI>Puicerda:</HI> Thus the unfor|tunate Count &s;aw him&s;elf all in a Moment re|moved
<PB N="65" REF="72">
from Court, where he flattered him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> long to continue in the King's and Princes fa+vour. But that Monarch was young, and de&s;ti+tute of Experience, and be&s;ides laboured unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ill Effects of a bad Education; for a Mini|&s;ter that regards nothing in the world but what has a particular relation to his own Intere&s;ts, will be &s;ure to keep back tho&s;e Lights from his Prince, that may help him afterwards to di&s;co|ver by what an ill Conduct he is managed. <HI>Don Juan</HI> was very well acquainted with the Policy of this Maxim, and accordingly took care to conceal the affairs of State from the King, with as much Precaution as the Prie&s;ts keep their My|&s;teries from the People. To make him&s;elf al|ways nece&s;&s;ary to him, he never in&s;tructed him in the Art of governing, but perpetually amu&s;ed him with &s;ome little in&s;ignificant Diver&s;ions, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his tender years with a Spirit of Lazine&s;s, which could never fail to produce ill Con&s;equences afterwards, and never gave him leave to &s;tir a foot out of the Palace but in his own Company.</P>
<P>The People that are never &s;en&s;ible of Events, but at the very Moment when they feel the Smart, had perhaps looked upon the Bani&s;hment of the Lords, and the captivity of their King with an indifferent Eye, if they had not been Sufferers them&s;elves. But the great Scarcity of Provi&s;ions that were daily inhanced, the irregu|lar Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and the di&s;orderly Management of the <HI>Finances,</HI> made them &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that the changing of Ma&s;ters is not always for the better. And as it is natural to run headlong from one extream into another, and the ju&s;t Limits of carrying on a Reformation are known but to a very few Peer&s;ons, &s;o they began to di&s;reli&s;h the Regency, and to &s;hew a Di&s;&s;atis|faction,
<PB N="66" REF="73">
that might ea&s;ily have been improv'd into an in&s;urrection, but that the anger of the People of <HI>Spain</HI> is generally week and feeble, and 'tis not only upon the&s;e occa&s;ions that the appa|rent fiercene&s;s of that Nation goes off, and va|ni&s;hes. For 'tis very true, that the People con|tent them&s;elves there with railing and murmu|ring, &s;o that if there was any thing to be feared it was from the Grandees, who nothwith&s;tand|ing their bani&s;hment, left very con&s;iderable Re|lations and Friends behind them at Court: The&s;e being concerned to &s;ee them exiled, began pri|vately to join and a&s;&s;ociate for the &s;ame Cau&s;e; they proceeded &s;o far as to &s;ignifie to the Queen that they pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ir'd her return, and that &s;he ought to attempt &s;omething on her &s;ide, as they were re&s;olv'd to do &s;omething on theirs, and in &s;hort they took an occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e the King about the matter.</P>
<P>They made him &s;en&s;ible that he was under a &s;lavi&s;h ignominious dependance, and confirmed him in his natural inclinations to take the Govern|ment of the State into his own hands.</P>
<P>He reli&s;hed very well the overtures they made him, and the Queen likewi&s;e received her infor|mations not without plea&s;ure; but it was not e|nough to wi&s;h well, &s;omething of Action was ne|ce&s;&s;ary: for the King was young, wanted a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and every one &s;hifted it off from him&s;elf to another. The plea&s;ures of the Court, and that la|zine&s;s which is &s;o peculiar to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made them advance &s;o &s;lowly in their affairs, that Don <HI>Joan</HI> had lei&s;ure enough to de&s;troy in one day the Foundations they had been laying for &s;everal weeks. The Queen for her part was under a con&s;inement, which held her chained to the place, &s;o that &s;he could attempt nothing without being di&s;covered. She was affraid too of find|ing
<PB N="67" REF="74">
Traitors among her own Servants, and draw|ing new Di&s;graces upon her, whil&s;t &s;he endea|voured to free her &s;elf from tho&s;e &s;he lay under at pre&s;ent. What was pa&s;t in&s;tructed her in &s;ome mea&s;ure to fear and avoid what was to come</P>
<P>As &s;he is naturally of a &s;low di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o after long reflections upon the matter, &s;he was of the opinion, that &s;he ought not by any precipitate actions hazard the future repo&s;e of her life.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> on his &s;ide was alarm'd with conti|nual fears and jealou&s;ies; and having abundance of Spies about him, he was in&s;tructed of what he did not care to hear, the unwearied de&s;igns that were daily form'd again&s;t him. Notwith|&s;tanding the great Authority and Power, with which he was inve&s;ted, he could not for bear very &s;en&s;ibly to apprehend the bad con&s;equences of an aver&s;ion, that began to be entertained &s;o general|ly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He was in a manner Re&s;pon&s;ible for all the good and all the bad &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the State, and the Weight of &s;o cumber&s;om a Monarchy hung very heavy about him. He &s;ometimes con&s;ide|red with regret the Tranquility he had formerly enjoyed in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Arragon</HI>; in fine his Spi|rit was not in its natural Sphere, and we may &s;ay of him, that he even over bought the plea&s;ure of making &s;o great a figure on the Theatre of the World.</P>
<P>The War that was kindled 1672. between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> intere&s;ted &s;everal Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> who took their &s;ides in it, either accord|ing to their &s;everal Inclinations, or el&s;e the par|ticular engagements they had to the Powers, that were then at variance. <HI>Spain,</HI> which is al|ways in&s;eparable from the intere&s;ts of the Em|pire, neither &s;pared her Mony nor Forces upon
<PB N="68" REF="75">
this occa&s;ion, when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made a peace with <HI>France</HI> fir&s;t in the year 1678. The Empe|ror and &s;ome of the Princes of the Empire fol|lowed their Example, nay <HI>Spain</HI> could not hin|der it &s;elf from doing the like. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who as yet kept their Swords in their hands &s;till, laid them down likewi&s;e, and a Peace was concluded at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> that gave Repo&s;e to all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was up|on the point off marrying the Arch-Dutche&s;s, the Emperor's Daughter: This Affair was &s;o far advanced, that the Articles were regulated, and the Contract &s;igned. This Marriage was of the Queen's doing, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired the Ac|compli&s;hment of it; but <HI>Don Juan</HI> at his Return broke of this Match, not being de&s;irous to &s;trengthen his Enemies Party, as it mu&s;t a&s;&s;ured|ly have been by the Acce&s;&s;ion of this young Prince&s;s, who was of the &s;ame Name and &s;ame Country with the Queen, and be&s;ides all this, was her Grand Daughter and Neice. He too much feared the ill Con&s;equences of this Affair to give his con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>The King about his nineteenth year &s;eemed to be &s;ettled in a healthful State of body, which promi&s;ed Succe&s;&s;ors to the Crown, and he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a great Inclination to be married; he con&s;idered that of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> he alone was left remaining of the Spani&s;h Branch, and that his whole Kingdom had an equal intere&s;t to &s;ee him have Children.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances of the Peace, that hapned to be concluded at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> made him ca&s;t his Eyes upon Mademoi&s;elle, Elde&s;t Daughter of Mon&s;ieur, who was the Kings only Brother. She was almo&s;t of his own age, amiable, well|&s;haped, of a &s;weet Di&s;po&s;ition, witty and charm|ing:
<PB N="69" REF="76">
All her inclinations were noble and ver|tuous, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great took an extraordi|nary affection to her, becau&s;e her Humour &s;o exactly &s;uited with his, &s;o that all the Courtiers were &s;urprized at it.</P>
<P>The King had accidentally &s;een &s;ome Portrai|tures of this Prince&s;s, and &s;everal Spani&s;h Lords who had been at the Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;pake of her as a Prodigy. The&s;e advantagious Te&s;timonies &s;o luckily concurring, &s;en&s;ibly affected him, he could not take his re&s;t a nights, he carried her Picture next his Heart, and held long Conver&s;a|tions with it, as if it under&s;tood him. But what is the mo&s;t incredible thing of all, and yet is re|lated for a certain Truth, is this, that before he became enamoured he could not endure any Wo|man near him, but the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions were alte|red in him upon this occa&s;ion, and he beheld the fair Sex never after with Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the People were ravi&s;hed with Joy to hear that the King de&s;ired Mademoi&s;elle. The Me|mory of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the fir&s;t Wife of <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. was &s;o deeply imprinted upon the Hearts of all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they de|&s;ired to &s;ee one of the &s;ame blood &s;it upon the Throne again.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> agreed with the Kings inclinations, as well as tho&s;e of the People in Relation to this Prince&s;s. He &s;ent orders to the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who was come from <HI>Nime|guen,</HI> where he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Treaty of Peace, to go and demand Mademoi&s;elle for the King his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Every one was &s;urprized that the Prince lent his helping Hand to this Affair. True Policy would have required him to protract as long as he was able and to delay the Marriage, becau&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="77">
as it gave a Wife to the King, &s;o it might per|haps give an Enemy to the Favourite.</P>
<P>And here many People could not forbear to call to mind the fir&s;t Ideas of that Ambition, of which he was &s;u&s;pected; now it was for good and all to abandon the De&s;ign of making him&s;elf declared Infant, to content him&s;elf with reign|ing after the King, in ca&s;e he had no Children. Many Per&s;ons do likewi&s;e pretend, that not|with&s;tanding the great Earne&s;tne&s;s he &s;hewed in publick, yet he had no over great De&s;ire to have the Match &s;ucceed. They alledge this for a Rea|&s;on, that he ought to have done &s;omething be|fore &s;o open an Emba&s;&s;y, by way of &s;ecret Di|&s;patches, which might ab&s;olutely have had the Succe&s;s of a Negotiation: But that at the Bot|tom, whatever he did or whatever he &s;aid to the contrary, he did not heartily de&s;ire it; that he was afraid le&s;t a French Queen, &s;upported by the Authority of the greate&s;t King in the World, would never truckle to him; that now he was Ma&s;ter, but hereafter would become no more than a Companion, Others were of the contrary opinion, and &s;aid that he had a fair Pro&s;pect of being well received by Made|moi&s;elle, e&s;pecially &s;ince he had broke off the Marriage with the Arch Dutche&s;s, and given the Preference to her. The&s;e different Con&s;ide|rations embarra&s;&s;ed and perplexed <HI>Don Juan</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, that he knew not which way to determine him&s;elf, and even at the very time that the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> demanded the Prince&s;s in <HI>France,</HI> he very cunningly got the King at <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee the Portraiture of the Infanta of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who was a Lady of admi|rable Beauty: He talked exceedingly of her Charms, and not knowing as yet that her Mar|riage with the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was agreed upon,
<PB N="71" REF="78">
he underhand made a Propo&s;al to give her to the King; but he was too deeply gone to alter his Affections.</P>
<P>The Demand made by <HI>Don Balbazez</HI> was very agreeable to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and <HI>Don Juan</HI> who received Advice of it, did not at fir&s;t doubt of its Succe&s;s. Therefore he now endeavoured to over&s;hoot the favourable Di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>France,</HI> either to promote his own intere&s;t by it, or el&s;e by demanding things that were too great, to meet a Refu&s;al, and by that means to find a plau&s;ible Pretence to break off. In effect, he pretended that Mademoi&s;elle not being the Daughter of a King, they ought there|fore for that rea&s;on on the &s;ide of the French Court to enter into particular Con&s;iderations, and re&s;tore to <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e Places, that were yielded up to <HI>France</HI> by the la&s;t Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this he held a Council, where he was de&s;irous to in&s;inuate his own Sentiments into them, but he found no body inclined to hearken to them. Every one concluded, that they ought to have nothing el&s;e in view but the King's Sa|tisfaction; that they were happy enough in find|ing out a Prince&s;s, that was beautiful and capa|ble to give them a Soveraign, and that they ought not to take pains to de&s;troy a thing of that Con&s;equence, which all the World &s;o earn|e&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Queen who continued &s;till very &s;olitary at <HI>Toledo,</HI> and who was con&s;ulted in no affairs, wrote a Letter to the King, wherein &s;he told him, &s;he had received Information that he was going to be married, that &s;he coun&s;elled him in the mean time, while that Affair was carrying on, to go to <HI>Arragon,</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to confirm the anci|ent Privileges of tho&s;e People. The King &s;ent
<PB N="72" REF="79">
her barely word again that he would do it, with|out explaining him&s;elf more openly upon his Marriage.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the twenty fourth of <HI>January</HI> 1679. the King had nominated tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were to fill up the re&s;pective Offices of the Hou&s;e of the new Queen. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> was made <HI>Camarera Major,</HI> that is, fir&s;t Lady of Ho|nour, but her Power is of a greater Extent than that of the other Ladies of Honour; becau&s;e &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of all the Women that &s;erve the Queen in her Palace. She is the Widow of the Duke <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> who was of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Pignatelli,</HI> and a Grandee of <HI>Spain.</HI> She inherited a va&s;t For|tune that de&s;cended to her from <HI>Fernando Cortez,</HI> for her Mother bore the Name of that famous Captain, who left her a &s;mall Kingdom in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> tho he might, if he plea&s;ed, have left her a more con&s;iderable one in that Part of the World, where he made &s;o great a Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>She is de&s;cended of a Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Arragon,</HI> that &s;etled a long while ago in <HI>Sicily</HI>; &s;he is extreamly rich, of a fierce imperious Hu|mour towards Per&s;ons that are above her, in&s;up|portable to her Equals, but kind and obliging to her Inferiours. She has a world of Wit, is fixed in her Re&s;olutions, and is of a deep penetrating Spirit: Her Temper cold and &s;erious, &s;till pre|&s;erving her Spani&s;h Gravity, and never &s;teps a foot backward or forward unle&s;s &s;he has well con|&s;idered of it before. She thunders out her <HI>I will,</HI> or <HI>I will not,</HI> enough to make one tremble.</P>
<P>She is a meager pale Woman, of a long and wrickled Vi&s;age, her Eyes little and &s;evere, in &s;hort &s;he makes a dangerous terrible Enemy. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">os</HI> of <HI>Arragon</HI> her Cou&s;in German was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> the Banditti, whom &s;he cau&s;ed expre&s;ly for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to come from <HI>Valentia,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="80">
becau&s;e he demanded of her Re&s;titution of the Dutchy of <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> which was in her Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, altho of right it belonged to him.</P>
<P>The terrible Noi&s;e this Affair made in the World, obliged her to retire into <HI>Arragon,</HI> where <HI>Don Juan</HI> re&s;ided at that time, deeply afflicted at his Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Both of them imagined, that they had rea|&s;on to complain of the Severity of their Fortune, and this &s;oon occa&s;ioned a certain Friend&s;hip be|tween them, as it u&s;ually happens among&s;t Per|&s;ons of their Quality when they come to be in|volved in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances. After they had frequently conver&s;ed with one another, the Prince found out part of the Dutche&s;&s;e's Hu|mour; he knew &s;he was ambitious, but as all the other ill qualities of her Soul were outward|ly &s;et off by the appearance of a great Devotion, he never took her for &s;o malicious and &s;pight|ful a Devil, as &s;he really was. He therefore ca&s;t his Eyes upon her to make her <HI>Camarera Major</HI> for the young Queen.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI> was nominated at the &s;ame time to be Grand Ma&s;ter of her Hou&s;e. <HI>Don Juan</HI> had &s;ome thoughts at fir&s;t of confer|ring this Office upon <HI>Don Vincente Gonzaga</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and made him quit his Viceroy&s;hip of <HI>Sicily</HI> to come and po&s;&s;e&s;s it, which the other freely left, in Con&s;ideration of the Place, that was now offered him. But his Expectations were deceived; for the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas,</HI> who had heaped up a prodigious Wealth when he was Viceroy or <HI>Naples,</HI> having profered the u&s;e of it to <HI>Don Juan,</HI> who migh|tily &s;tood in need of Mony at that time and ac|cepted the Profer, was preferred to <HI>Don Vin|cente,</HI> who was admitted however into the
<PB N="74" REF="81">
Council of State, where his great Abilities, with|out Que&s;tion, did great Service.</P>
<P>Altho the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI> continued as yet in exile, <HI>Don Juan</HI> did not forget to nominate him for Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the Queen; he be|&s;towed that Place upon him only that he might have an opportunity to take away from him that of the Pre&s;ident of the Orders, where his Conduct it &s;eems did not plea&s;e him. He affect|ed a certain Air of Devotion that &s;at very di&s;a|greeably upon him, becau&s;e he mixed too much Bigotry with it, and it was a &s;trange &s;ort of Bi|gotry too; for this good Duke one evening cau&s;ed the Count <HI>d'Humanez</HI> to be &s;et upon in the Streets by &s;ome men of <HI>Valencia,</HI> who never come to <HI>Madrid</HI> but to commit Murders and other Crimes of that nature. The occa&s;ion of the Quarrel was this, the Duke was pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with a certain Lady, and &s;oon after came to di&s;cover that the Count was a more fortunate man than him&s;elf. Neverthele&s;s the Count e&s;caped the Danger. This affair made a great Bu&s;tle; <HI>Don Juan</HI> who was particularly di&s;gu&s;ted at the Duke, laid hold of this oppor|tunity to bani&s;h him the Court, but now pro|cured this con&s;iderable po&s;t for him, that he might gain over to his party a man of &s;o great an importance; be&s;ides it was his intere&s;t to &s;ee the Chief Offices of the Queen's Hou&s;e fil|led with tho&s;e Per&s;ons that were at his Devotion, and might prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the mind of that young Prince&s;s in favour of him. The other Officers of her Hou&s;e were likewi&s;e nominated about the the beginning of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era, Major Domo</HI> to the Queen-Mother was fined a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which he paid up|on the Nail. After this manner the King &s;ome|times
<PB N="75" REF="82">
puni&s;hes the Crimes that the Grandees commit again&s;t him. He was &s;oon after bani&s;hed to the Ca&s;tle <HI>de Cocchia,</HI> and his place was given to the Count <HI>de Chinchon.</HI> But the Queen be|ing highly incen&s;ed at the&s;e Proceedings, de|clared that &s;he would never &s;uffer it, alledg|ing that the Widow of <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth, and Mo|ther of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd ought not to be treated after this unworthy manner; &s;o they were for|ced to let the matter drop, and proceed no farther in it.</P>
<P>There happened a little after another bu&s;ine&s;s, that occa&s;ioned a great Clamour. <HI>Don Franci&s;|co de Toledo,</HI> &s;econd Son of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> the Count <HI>de Mirande</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valero</HI> Son of the Duke <HI>de Bejar,</HI> and the elde&s;t Son of the Duke <HI>de Se&s;&s;a</HI> occa&s;io|ned the E&s;cape of a man, that was accu&s;ed of great Crimes. The manner whereby they brought it about, was this. They &s;ent a Woman with a Basket of Fi&s;h to &s;tand near the Pri&s;on, &s;he &s;old &s;uch good Pennyworths there, that a man ap|pointed for the pupo&s;e having informed the Jaylor, and the Keepers of it, they pre&s;ently ran to the place to by &s;ome Fi&s;h. The Woman amu&s;ed them with abundance of fooli&s;h Stories &s;o well, that &s;he &s;uceeded in her De&s;ign, for in the mean time the above-mentioned Lords broke open the Pri&s;on Gates.</P>
<P>The King ordered all of them to be arre&s;ted, however this Affair, like others of the &s;ame na|ture at <HI>Madrid,</HI> brought no ill Con&s;equences upon them.</P>
<P>The King took all the care imaginable to have the young Queens Apartments in the Pa|lace fitted up, and made ready. He was to have gone according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, in the Month of <HI>April</HI> to <HI>Aranjues,</HI> but <HI>Don Juan</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="83">
hindred him, becau&s;e that place was too near <HI>Tolcdo,</HI> &s;o he went to <HI>Buen-Retiro.</HI> The Queen-Mother wrote to him thither, de&s;iring that he would be plea&s;ed to come and &s;ee her; but tho &s;he pre&s;s'd it with a great deal of Tenderne&s;s and Importunity, &s;he was not able to &s;ucceed in her De&s;ires.</P>
<P>He diverted him&s;elf every day with hunting and &s;eeing Comedies, either at <HI>Pardo</HI> or <HI>Zar|zuela,</HI> which are two Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure belong|ing to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Opera <HI>d'Alcine</HI> was repre&s;ented before him, it co&s;t a world of Mony, but was mi&s;erably performed.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e a Bull-fea&s;t kept, where two young Cavaliers unfortunately peri&s;hed. On the following day there was running at the Ring.</P>
<P>About this time the Prince <HI>de Ligne</HI> arrived, and a day or two after ki&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's hand, and took his Place at the Council of State. Fa|ther <HI>Francis de Relux</HI> a Dominican came likewi&s;e from <HI>Salamanca,</HI> where he had been Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and was cho&s;en by <HI>Don Juan</HI> to be the Kings Confe&s;&s;or. The Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> had enga|ged that he &s;hould &s;ubmit him&s;elf intirely to <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s Will, who accepted him upon his Parole. At this time the Cardinal <HI>de Portacarero</HI> Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI> returned from <HI>Rome.</HI> The Court at <HI>Madrid</HI> was very full and numerous.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>France</HI> named the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> to be hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Spain,</HI> who was at that tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> under the &s;ame Character at <HI>Savoy.</HI> He wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> known to the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> for in the yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1673. he re&s;ided there in Quality of Amba&s;&s;a+dor; he arrived at <HI>Madrid</HI> on the &s;eventeent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>June,</HI> and tho&s;e Per&s;ons that were well ac+quainted with the Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> ve+ry much doubted whether he would meet with
<PB N="77" REF="84">
that Reception, which he might rea&s;onably pro|mi&s;e him&s;elf: They knew well enough that the natural Haughtine&s;s of <HI>Don Juan</HI> would never comply with the In&s;tructions of that Mini&s;ter, who to be &s;ure would never go to vi&s;it the Prince, unle&s;s he were a&s;&s;ured beforehand of re|ceiving the honour of the Hand, the Step and the Chair; that <HI>Don Juan</HI> would never con&s;ent to this Propo&s;al, becau&s;e it was not to be ima|gined that he would ea&s;ily give up the rights he had obtained over the other Amba&s;&s;adors, and that it would be an inconvenient thing for him of <HI>France</HI> not to treat directly with the chief Mi|ni&s;ter. What People &s;urmi&s;ed upon this occa&s;i|on really happened, for rhe Prince would not bate him an Ace, and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> kept fa&s;t to his In&s;tructions. Therefore they looked upon one another with great coldne&s;s, but neverthele&s;s this did not hinder the Amba&s;&s;a|dor from having a private Audience of the King on the eighth of <HI>July,</HI> and a publick one a little after, upon the conclu&s;ion of his Marriage with Mademoi&s;elle.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan</HI> had three Fits of a Tertian Ague towards the beginning of <HI>July.</HI> On the thirteenth the Secretary of the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> ar|rived, who brought word that the King had con&s;ented to the Marriage of Mademoi&s;elle with the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> Nothing is equal to the Joy that he &s;hew'd upon this Account, for he had expected the news with the greate&s;t Impatience. He ordered <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be &s;ung at our Ladies <HI>d'Atocha,</HI> all the Hou&s;es in the City were illu|minated with white Wax Tapers, and Bonefires were to be &s;een in every Street. An hundred and fifty Cavaliers of the be&s;t Families in the Kingdom performed a Ma&s;querate on hor&s;e|back, that con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ome Embroiderie,
<PB N="78" REF="85">
Tiffany Ribbons and Feathers; for they were apparalled in black as they u&s;ed to be, but were not ma&s;qued at all. After this manner they ran all night, every man carrying a Flambeaux in his Hand: All the&s;e Diverti&s;ements la&s;ted three Days and three Nights. A Courier ar|rived &s;oon after, who brought the Contract of the King's Marriage, this was &s;oon communica|ted to the Queen-Mother, who expre&s;s'd a great deal of Joy at it. The Ratification was pre&s;ent|ly &s;ent back, and Bonefires were made as be|fore.</P>
<P>While the People did thus endeavour to ex|pre&s;s their Zeal to the King, the Servants of the Queen-Mother were bu&s;ied in finding out &s;ome means or other to advance her Return. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> had refu&s;ed to follow the ex|ample of the other Amba&s;&s;adors in the Conduct they u&s;ed towards <HI>Don Juan</HI> upon the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e new cu&s;toms, which they &s;uffered him to e&s;tabli&s;h; and this &s;eemed a favourable op|portunity to per&s;wade the Enemies of the Prince, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villars</HI> had &s;ome &s;ecret In&s;tru|ctions which were not favourable to him. They flattered them&s;elves immediately with the hopes of making him one of their party, and believed it would extreamly &s;trengthen their own &s;ide if they could once bring him over to them. Up|on this Con&s;ideration, the greater Part of the Cortiers applauded him mightily for his Con|&s;tauncy, and made him abundance of Comple|ments upon that Score. He was re&s;pected at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and had the good fortune to find out &s;everal of his Friends again, and the Queen-Mo|ther &s;hewed a particular E&s;teem for him. She gave him a very obliging proof of this, when he came to wait upon her at <HI>Toledo</HI>; for after publick Audience was over, &s;he was plea&s;ed to
<PB N="79" REF="86">
entertain him in private about her own Affairs, and te&s;tified what an entire Confidence &s;he re|po&s;ed in him: But altho &s;everal Propo&s;al were made to him, to be of a Party again&s;t the Prince, and be&s;ides his own natural Di&s;po&s;ition led him to e&s;pou&s;e the Quarrel of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who op|po&s;ed a Mini&s;ter, who&s;e civilities he had no great rea&s;on to applaud, yet he was of opinion that in this pre&s;ent Conjuncture it would be his be&s;t way to remain Neuter.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered &s;till, that the Marriage of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with Mademoi&s;elle would bring along with it &s;ome Agreements that were not to be expected before the Arrival of that Prin|ce&s;s, that it was a &s;ure unfailing way to oppo&s;e one Power to another, that this young Prince&s;s would never &s;uffer the Mini&s;ter of <HI>France</HI> to be run down in that Court where &s;he was to become the Mi&s;tre&s;s and &s;ole Delight, that it was certain &s;he would link her &s;elf to the intere&s;ts of the Queen Mother; that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Queen who loved both the one and the other very affectio|nately, would be &s;ure to give her this in charge before her Departure among&s;t the other Coun&s;els, which &s;he was always to ob&s;erve; that their Credit being united together and &s;econded by all tho&s;e Per&s;ons, that de&s;ired another Govern|ment, <HI>Don Juan</HI> would without que&s;tion find him&s;elf obliged to give way. Mo&s;t Per&s;ons rea&s;oned after the &s;ame manner upon this Affair, and encouraged one another to &s;tand firm again&s;t the Favourite; they now began to &s;peak tho&s;e Things aloud which before they were almo&s;t afraid to mutter in private; they complained of him, and importuned the King to call the Ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">es home, and openly promoted the Return of the Queen-Mother. <HI>Don Juan</HI> was now more
<PB N="80" REF="87">
di&s;quieted than ever: The Appearance only of his fall had prevailed with &s;everal Per&s;ons, who ought to have been his Creatures, to abandon him for good and all; and as for tho&s;e that re|mained, they had neither Authority, nor Merit enough to &s;upport him. He could &s;carce find a|ny Comfort but when he was alone, but this &s;ort of Conduct does not always afford a man a Sanctuary; for even the Silence, the Retirement, and the infinite Reflections we make are rather apt to perplex and di&s;turb, than to relieve our Spirits. He was &s;till more afflicted, when he &s;aw &s;ome of his Friends, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as he believed to be &s;o, embrace the intere&s;ts that were directly oppo&s;ite to his, and he knew they employed the Confe&s;&s;or's credit with the King to bring all the&s;e matters about.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that <HI>Don Juan</HI> was the man who cau&s;ed him to come from <HI>Sala|manca,</HI> and after he had advanced him to this Preferment, thought he might ever after have him at his Devotion. Neverthele&s;s, whether he had promi&s;ed him nothing, or really broke his word, 'tis certain he quitted the Prince's party, and caballed among&s;t his Enemies. Some People pretend that this proceeded from a Prin|ciple of Con&s;cience, but it is impo&s;&s;ible that in|gratitude &s;hould ever flow from a good Prin|ciple. However it was, he obtained for the Prince&s;s <HI>de Stillano,</HI> who was the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s Daughter, the Return of her Husband. <HI>Don Juan</HI> had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, and found &s;o little Credit upon this occa&s;ion, that he was &s;en|&s;ibly afflicted at it: For the thing it &s;eems was pu&s;hed &s;o far, that the King out of pure Com|plai&s;ance to his Confe&s;&s;or &s;aid, <HI>it &s;ignifies nothing that</HI> Don Juan <HI>oppo&s;es it, 'tis enough that I would</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="88">
<HI>have it &s;o.</HI> The&s;e few words very much increa|&s;ed the Prince's Melancholy; but as Misfor|tunes &s;eldom come unattended, there happened another Mortification upon the Account of the Duke of <HI>O&s;&s;one,</HI> who was in the number of the Exiles. The Prince had &s;ent him notice by &s;ome of his Friends, that he de&s;ired him to throw up his Place of Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the new Queen, which he had lately be&s;towed upon him, but he rejected his Propo&s;al with the greate&s;t Scorn imaginable. <HI>Don Juan</HI> was mightily enra|ged at it, and would have bani&s;hed him farther off, to make him &s;en&s;ible of his Power, and of the Affront he had done him in pretending to oppo&s;e his Intentions: but he was &s;o far from &s;ucceeding in his Project, that he &s;aw the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> who hitherto kept fair Mea&s;ures with him, had prevailed with the King to recall the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one.</HI> The Son of the Duke <HI>de Me|dina Celi</HI> had married the Daughter of the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one,</HI> and this occa&s;ioned the great Friend|&s;hip between them. The Pretence was, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to be with the Queen, and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> having found a favou|rable Opportunity, told the King that he was not a little concerned to &s;ee a man of the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI>'s Quality, who had the honour to po&s;&s;e&s;s one of the highe&s;t Offices in the Queen's Hou&s;e, bani&s;hed &s;o far from Court, at a time when all tho&s;e Per&s;ons that ought to &s;erve her, &s;hould be making Preparations to meet her. The King con&s;ented to his Return, as likewi&s;e to the Count <HI>de Monterey</HI>'s, upon Condition that they &s;hould neither make nor receive any Vi&s;its at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>A general Cu&s;tom &s;eldom fails to hold true for any particular Per&s;ons, and 'tis an u&s;ual ob&s;er|vation, that when we begin to receive any one
<PB N="82" REF="89">
Misfortune, we ought to expect another. <HI>Don Juan</HI> being per&s;waded that he was not happy e|nough to be excepted from this invidious Rule, was de&s;irous to &s;trengthen his Party by the Au|thority of the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>; but he met with a very unlucky Rub in his way, for having engaged the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> to propo&s;e an Accom|modation to him, the Con&s;table calling to mind the in&s;upportable Pride wherewith <HI>Don Juan</HI> had formerly treated him, and therefore &s;till looking upon the Prince as his formidable Ene|my, an&s;wered very coldly, that the time was pa&s;t. To encrea&s;e his troubles, all tho&s;e that were exiled came into favour, for they took an opportunity to &s;olicit their Return whil&s;t he was &s;ick, and made &s;uch Advantages of that Conjun|cture, and pu&s;hed matters &s;o home, that the King was re&s;olved to call home the Queen-Mo|ther. While they were deliberating upon the Conduct, that was to be ob&s;erved in this Affair, the King held a long Conver&s;ation with the In|qui&s;itor General; he &s;ent his Confe&s;&s;or to ac|quaint the Duke <HI>de Medina Cel&iuml;</HI> of the Hou&s;e <HI>de la Cerda,</HI> and the Count <HI>d'Oropeza</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Braganza</HI> to meet at an oppointed Hour at the Inqui&s;itors. When they were met, the King &s;ent them word by the aforementioned Father <HI>Relux</HI> to advi&s;e him of the be&s;t Method to remove <HI>Don Juan,</HI> and recall the Queen-Mother. The day was &s;pent in Conference, and after all, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed that the King &s;hould de|part from the Palace as if he were going out to hunt, and that before his Return he &s;hould &s;end word to the Prince to withdraw immedi|ately. This Project was not put in Execution, the Prince knew not a &s;yllable of the matter, and for want of re&s;olution and courage the de&s;ign fell.</P>
<P>On the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>June,</HI> a Bull-fea&s;t was
<PB N="83" REF="90">
kept, where there was very good Sport, at the &s;ame time the Marque&s;s <HI>de Fuentes</HI> got to be made Coun&s;eller of the military Affairs. The King gave Orders to the Gentlemen of his Bed|chamber, who were to meet the Queen upon the way, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with three Suits of Clothes apeice, and two of them were to be after the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Our Amba&s;&s;ador made his Entry on the thir|teenth of <HI>August,</HI> and we did not fail to go to &s;ome of our Friends to behold the Show. 'Tis a Cu&s;tom there for the King to &s;end the Amba&s;&s;a|dor a certain number of Hor&s;es out of his own Stable both for him&s;elf and his Attendants, for the Amba&s;&s;adors make their Entry on Hor&s;eback; next morning the <HI>Major Domo</HI> in waiting, the Conductor of the Amba&s;&s;adors and his Deputy accompanied him from his own Hou&s;e to the Pa|lace. In his publick Audience, which he had of the King, he always &s;poke in <HI>French</HI>; the Pro|ce&s;&s;ion of his Entry was a long time interrupted by the Opiniatret&eacute; of the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Malta,</HI> who pretended that his Coach ought immediate|ly to follow that of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who was the la&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador of the Chappel, in &s;uch manner that he was got before the &s;econd Coa|ches of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars:</HI> But to put an End to the Di&s;pute, the Conductor of the Am|ba&s;&s;adors was &s;ent to the Palace, where every thing was adju&s;ted to the Advantage of the Am|ba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> and the Preten&s;ions of him of <HI>Malta,</HI> who was <HI>Don Diego de Braeamonte,</HI> were adjudged to be ill grounded, &s;ince the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of Crowned Heads never gave him the right Hand at their Hou&s;es.

<P>All this publick Rejoycing did not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s melancholy; and 'tis cer|tain, the great Perplexity of mind he was under very much impaired his Health, and the Vigour of his Con&s;titution. He was at a &s;tand what Party to take, for as he had too much Bavery ever to think of giving way to his Enemies, &s;o his Credit was not &s;trong enough to put him in Capacity of re&s;i&s;ting them. In this violent Condition, he was &s;en&s;ible enough that he &s;hould never be able to &s;u&s;tain the Weight of his Af|fliction, and to &s;ay the truth, it co&s;t him his Life at la&s;t; But great men &s;eldom complain when they become the Sport of Fortune, and after their Example <HI>Don Juan</HI> expected his la&s;t day with the Con&s;tancy and Steadine&s;s of a Heroe, His Tertian Ague &s;eized him again, and on the &s;eventh of <HI>September</HI> he found him&s;elf &s;o extreamly ill, that the Phy&s;icians acquainted the King that there was but little hopes of his Reco|very. At this News his Maje&s;ty wept, and te|&s;tified a &s;en&s;ible Grief. He ordered Cardi|nal <HI>Portocarero</HI> to go to him and learn what Condition he was in; he appeared but little con|cerned, and prepared him&s;elf for Death like a good Chri&s;tian and Philo&s;opher: He comforted all his Friends with a wonderful Pre&s;ence of mind, <HI>A Man has lived long enough,</HI> &s;aid he to them, <HI>when he dies without having any thiog to reproach him, I mean in Relation to Honour: As for what Concerns my duty to God I have been too defi|cient,</HI>

<HI>and the timeof my Repentance cannot be too long.</HI> He received the Holy <HI>Viaticum,</HI> and the King almo&s;t every other moment came into his Chamber, te&s;tifying a great deal of Friend&s;hip for him, and tenderly complained, that he would abandon him at a Juncture, when his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance was become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him. <HI>Don Juan</HI> made his Will, by which he con&s;tituted the King his Heir, he left almo&s;t all his Jewels to the young Queen, and the Queen-Mother, and named Cardinal <HI>Portocarero,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and the Pre|&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> to be his Executors. He like|wi&s;e gave Order, that as &s;oon as ever he was dead, they &s;hould remove his Cabinet, which was filled with Papers of great Importance, out of his own Apartment to that of the King. This extream Illne&s;s of the Prince put &s;ome Stop to the publick Rejoycings that were re&s;olved up|on, and particularly to a Bull-fea&s;t, but howe|ver it did not hinder them from making fine artificial Fireworks in the Court of the Palace; nay he de&s;ired it him&s;elf, altho' he was troubled with a furious pain in his Head, that might very well be increa&s;ed with the Noi&s;e of Rockets and Crackers. All this while his Phy&s;icians, who knew nothing of the profound melancholy wherein he was plunged, puni&s;hed his body for an Indi&s;po&s;ition, that was properly lodged in the mind, and made him &s;uffer a &s;ort of Martyrdom by the &s;everal Torments they inflicted upon him. In fine, this poor Prince died on the &s;eventeenth of <HI>September</HI> 1679. on the very &s;ame day that his Father <HI>Philip</HI> IV. did. He was born in 1626. and abounded with a thou&s;and good Qualities.

He was Governour of the Low Countries, of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Charolois</HI>; but he came back to march once more again&s;t the <HI>Portugue&s;es.</HI> After the Death of the King his Father, he pa&s;&s;ed his time, as is above-mentio|ned, at <HI>Con&s;uegra,</HI> the Ordinary Re&s;idence of the Grand Prior of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and when the pre&s;ent King came to be of Age, he continued near him. On the twentieth his body was carried to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> and was interred in the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> for &s;o the place is called where they lay the Bodies of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> but tho&s;e of the Princes and Prince&s;&s;es of the Royal Family are placed in a Vault which is not far from it; nay they don't lay the Bodies of the Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>Pan|theon</HI> unle&s;s they have had Children. He left a very beautiful Daughter behind him, whom he had by a Per&s;on of great Quality.

<P>The fir&s;t Journey the King made after the Death of <HI>Don Juan</HI> was to go and vi&s;it the Queen-Mother.

one another, and dined, and afterwards entertained one another a long time in private. All tho&s;e that accompanied the King, ki&s;&s;ed her Maje&s;ty's hand; &s;o after the day was agreed up|on for her to come back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> he left her. We may ea&s;ily believe, that &s;he took but little time to prepare her &s;elf for a Journey that was &s;o welcome to her. The King parted from <HI>Ma|drid</HI> on the twenty &s;eventh, he lay again at <HI>A|ranjuez</HI> and the next day he &s;et forward to meet the Queen on the way that leads to <HI>Toledo.</HI> As &s;oon as they met, he de&s;ired her to come into his Coach that they might di&s;cour&s;e in private, and &s;o he brought her to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> which is one of the King's Hou&s;es &s;cituate at the end of the City. There &s;he re&s;ted her &s;elf for &s;ome time, till the Hou&s;e of the Duke <HI>Duzeda</HI> could be fit|ted up for her, which it &s;eems &s;he cho&s;e to re&s;ide in, becau&s;e the Palace was not &s;pacious enough to lodge the two Queens. It would be an end|le&s;s Piece of Trouble to reckon up all the Per&s;ons of Quality, be&s;ides the va&s;t Multitudes of Peo|ple that accompanied their Maje&s;ties at their Arrival; and indeed this mighty Alteration of Fortune was very remarkable on the Queen-Mo|ther's &s;ide. There was an univer&s;al Joy for her Return in the very &s;ame City, where but two years ago <HI>Don Juan</HI> was &s;een to enter as the De|liverer of his Country, and the Queen to go out like a meer Fugitive under all the weight of the publick Hatred. The King tarried there till e|vening, and there &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed a day over his Head, from the time he went to meet the Queen fir&s;t on the Road, but he dined with her, and &s;taid a long time in her Company.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> or <HI>Dalbe,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Toledo,</HI> he has a va&s;t E&s;tate and a con&s;iderable Revenue, and yet for all that, is not before hand in the World; he enjoys &s;everal good Places and a large Pen&s;ion at Court. He was a witty obli|ging Per&s;on, and &s;hew'd but little kindne&s;s to the Queen-Mother. He was 67 years old.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro de Arragon</HI> was fomerly known by the name of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Pobar,</HI> he endea|voured to relieve <HI>Perpignan,</HI> when he was Ge|neral of the Hor&s;e, but had the ill Luck to fall

into the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> among&s;t whom he continued a Pri&s;oner for &s;ome time. At his Return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the King made him Governour to the Prince <HI>Don Baltazar</HI> his Son, who died by overheating him&s;elf, and was afterwards let Blood in vain. The King upon this was enra|ged again&s;t <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> bani&s;hed him. When the King was dead, the Queen Regent called him home, and &s;ent him Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Rome.</HI> After this he was made Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> where according to the Cu&s;tom he heaped a great Trea|&s;ure together, and what is more remarkable, knew how to keep it, for this is not the Genius of that Nation. He was 77 years old.</P>
<P>The Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> of the Family <HI>d'Hen|riquez,</HI> de&s;cended from a Ba&s;tard of the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> was a great Lord, and better &s;haped than any in the Court: He was tall of Stature and well proportioned, the Air of his Face was great and noble, and he had a world of Wit, was of a gentle ea&s;ie Deportment, and had nothing to trouble him, but only his being 58. years old. He had an excellent Tallent at writing of Ver&s;es, which flowed naturally from him, and in the&s;e Diver&s;ions he employed him&s;elf more than in his Dome&s;tick Affairs. He was born a <HI>Libertine,</HI> and lived private, and could not fix him&s;elf &s;o as to make a regular Court either to the King or the Chief Mini&s;ter. He was of opinion that whatever is done by Con&s;traint cannot be recom|pen&s;ed by all the Favours of Fortune, he commu|nicated him&s;elf to a very few Per&s;ons, whether it were, becau&s;e he had too exqui&s;ite and nice a Ta&s;t to accommodate him&s;elf to all the World, or becau&s;e he was a Lover of Solitude, which the mo&s;t delicious Gardens and the fine&s;t Hou&s;e in <HI>Madrid</HI> recommended to him.

<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI> of the Family <HI>d'Ozo|rio</HI> was in his time a per&s;on of the greate&s;t Gal|lantry in the World, and notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;advantage of being 68. years old, continued &s;till to be &s;o. He was of a chearful lively Spirit, and talked ju&s;tly and well upon all occa&s;ions. He was Grand Ma&s;ter of the young Queens Hor&s;e. His Lady having entertained an impla|cable Jealou&s;ie and Hatred again&s;t a young beau|tiful Woman, for whom he had an extraordina|nary Affection, found an occa&s;ion to kill her, took out her Heart and made a Ragoo of it. When her Husband had eaten part of it, &s;he asked him how he liked it, he an&s;wered very well. I am much &s;urprized at it, &s;ays &s;he, for 'tis the Heart of your Mi&s;tre&s;s, and immediately drew out her Head, all bloody as it was, from under her Far|thingal, and &s;o threw it upon the Table, where he was with &s;everal of his Friends. 'Tis ea&s;ie to imagine how deeply he was concerned at &s;o Tra|gical a Sight, &s;he &s;aved her&s;elf in a Convent, whether &s;he retired full of Rage and Jealou&s;ie, and never &s;tirred out of it. The Marque&s;s's af|fliction was &s;o great, that it had like to have made an end of him. He was exceeding rich.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>de Stillano</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gu&s;|man,</HI> and Duke <HI>de Medina de las Torres,</HI> had abundance of Wit, and if he had joyned a little more Experience to his natural Parts, had a&s;&s;ured|ly have been capable of the greate&s;t Things.

When he married the Daugh|ter of Duke <HI>d'Albe</HI> he ordered a Sedan to be made for her all covered over with Plates of Gold, and garni&s;hed with Coral; but when it was fini&s;hed, no body was found &s;trong enough to carry it.

<P>The Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI> of the Hou&s;e <HI>de' Giron</HI> was Ma&s;ter both of good and bad Qualities, that equally di&s;tingui&s;hed him.

He was a man of an inflexible Steadine&s;s, and always had &s;ome Quarrel or other in Court or City. He was one of the riche&s;t Noblemen in <HI>Spain,</HI> and might be about 49. years old. He had been Vice-Roy of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> Go|vernour of <HI>Milan,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Orders, and was Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the young Queen.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Chinchon</HI> was formerly called Marque&s;s <HI>de Bayonna:</HI> He had been General of the Spani&s;h Gallies, was a brave man, he neither was rich, nor de&s;ired to be &s;o. He was 60. years old.</P>

<P><HI>Don Louis Portocarero,</HI> Cardinal and Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t Benefices in <HI>Spain.</HI> He was extreamly rich, and his Arch-bi&s;hoprick was worth three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per annum</HI> to him.

<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> who carried the name of <HI>de Haro Gu&s;man,</HI> had two very oppo&s;ite Qualities, he was liberal and yet covetous, he carried his magni&s;icence even to an exce&s;s, con&s;idering his Rank in the World, but e&s;pecially towards his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; neverthele&s;s he &s;ometimes &s;hewed his Frugality in Things that did him no Credit. He had but an ordinary meen, and was ill fa|voured, but was Ma&s;ter of all the Wit, Penetra|tion and Vivacity imaginable. He was a great Lord, full of Ambition, and &s;o naturally forward and adventurous, that they feared him at Court, and kept him always at a great Di&s;tance. He was Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Rome,</HI> and was 42. years old.</P>

'Tis true abundance of per&s;ons that were very well read in Politicks, judged that the Queen-Mother would not per|haps manage the Reins of the Government, they pretended <Q REND="inline">that this would be always a weighty and trouble&s;om Charge, that &s;he had been of late years accu&s;tomed to ea&s;e and quietne&s;s, and having undergone all the varie|ties of an uncertain fortune, &s;he was afraid of &s;eeing her &s;elf expo&s;ed to them the &s;econd time; that there was hopes &s;he would di&s;|&s;wade the King from taking a chief Mini&s;ter, and that &s;he would be forward enough to make him conceive an aver&s;ion for one; that to effect this &s;he only needed to put him in mind of the &s;orry figure he made, when Don <HI>Juan</HI> had &s;uch an authority over him, and that in fine &s;he would endeavour to form a Junta, which &s;hould be compo&s;ed of her own Creatures; that this would be the true way to R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">n, without making her &s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for any events; that all her Orders would be punctually executed, and yet &s;he not appear to have any hand in them.</Q> I ought to ac|quaint my Reader, that a <HI>Junta</HI> is an extraor|dinary Council of State, which the Kings of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> to remedy the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities of the State: For example, <HI>Philip</HI> IV. by his la&s;t Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> created a <HI>Junta</HI> to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Council during the minority of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> his Son.</P>
<P>Thus people &s;earched after, and as ea&s;ily found out the Lords who were to compo&s;e this <HI>Junta</HI>; the hatred or the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e per|&s;ons that made re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ections upon the pre&s;ent af|fairs enriched or impoveri&s;hed tho&s;e they had a <PB N="103" REF="112">

But the Queen-Mother made no &s;tir, &s;he &s;eemed in appearance to have no other thoughts than how to e&s;tabli&s;h her &s;elf in the favour of the King her Son, and &s;erve her &s;elf in the &s;ame condition.</P>
<P>This young Prince was pa&s;&s;ionately in love, and was &s;en&s;ible of all the plea&s;ure that accom|panies tho&s;e agreeable Ideas, that love u&s;es to in&s;pire, and flattered him&s;elf to &s;ee all his expe|ctations &s;uddenly crowned; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a Prin|ce&s;s, who was already become &s;o dear to him, employed his heart to &s;uch a degree, that he could think of nothing el&s;e. He pre&s;&s;ed the time of his departure that he might be the &s;ooner with her.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Courier, who brought the news, that the Queen was advanced to|wards the frontiers was expected with ex|tream impatience. The Marque&s;s <HI>de l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Bal|bazez</HI> &s;ent them word exactly on what day &s;he was to arrive at <HI>Irun:</HI> while &s;he was in the ter|ritories of <HI>France</HI> the King's Hou&s;hold waited upon her. The Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> accompanied her in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary, and the Prince&s;s his Wife likewi&s;e made the Jour|ney.

Nothing was omitted in any of the Cities
<PB N="104" REF="113">
through which her Maje&s;ty pa&s;&s;ed, to receive her with a re&s;pect &s;uitable to her high rank, and we may &s;ay &s;he &s;o much &s;et off the Grandeur of her Birth by her natural beauty, and by her en|gaging and courteous deportment; that all <HI>France</HI> was &s;en&s;ibly grieved to lo&s;e her.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t per&s;ons that took the free|dom to &s;peak to the Queen and give her advice was a Religious <HI>Theatin,</HI> called Father <HI>Vintimiglia.</HI> He was born in <HI>Sicily</HI> of an Illu&s;trious Family, and was Brother to the Count <HI>de Prade</HI> who happened to be Governour of <HI>Palermo</HI> at the time when that City revolted in the late trou|bles. He had been &s;eized, and people thought it would have co&s;t him his head, but he got the favour to be &s;ent to <HI>Madrid</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf; his Brother the <HI>Theatin</HI> went along with him to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his credit. He was a bold hardy adventurous man, and devoted him&s;elf entirely to Don <HI>Juan,</HI> and his zeal for that Prince car|ried him &s;o far, that in &s;ome of his Sermons he &s;poke of the Queen-Mother with very little re|&s;pect. This Father departed from <HI>Madrid,</HI> in company with the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one,</HI> and tho' he had not now any hopes of being made the Queen's Con&s;e&s;&s;or, as he had before the death of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> yet he could not forbear to go as far as <HI>Bayonne</HI> to &s;alute her; his deportment, his birth, and his knowledge of the <HI>French</HI> tongue, which he &s;poke perfectly well, becau&s;e he had re&s;ided a long time at <HI>Paris,</HI> procured him ac|ce&s;s enough to the young Queen to take his opportunity of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her with &s;ome &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies again&s;t the Queen her Mother-in-Law, and the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador. By this piece of conduct he did not only de|&s;ign to injure tho&s;e per&s;ons who had formerly
<PB N="105" REF="114">
been enemies to Don <HI>Juan,</HI> but he had a parti|cular aim, that Per&s;onally re&s;pected him&s;elf, and wherein his ambition had by much the up|per hand of his di&s;cretion: and that was to per&s;wade the Queen to endeavour the erecting of a <HI>Junta,</HI> that was to depend &s;olely upon her. He told her, that in order to bring this de&s;ign about, &s;he was to chu&s;e the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI> to be a member of it, becau&s;e he was a per&s;on of con&s;ummate abilities, and be&s;ides had a great zeal for her Maje&s;ty, he took care to reckon him&s;elf in the number of the Mini&s;ters, and could not forbear to write a Scheme of the Go|vernment; the Memoirs of which he gave to the Duke <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> to the end that he might pre&s;ent them to the Queen, but 'tis very pro|bable, he never &s;howed them to her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Queen was now advanced as far as St. <HI>John-de-Luz,</HI> and &s;he departed from thence a|bout One a Clock in the Afternoon on the third of <HI>November,</HI> followed by the Guards <HI>du Corps</HI> of the King. She came to a Wooden hou&s;e that was purpo&s;ely prepared for her, it was Gilded and Painted within and without, there was a great Hall in it, a Chamber, and a moveable Clo&s;et of Crim&s;on-Damask with Galloon and a rich Lace of Gold and Silver. This Hou&s;e was &s;cituate upon the brink of the River <HI>de Bida&s;&s;oa</HI> which parts <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Spain.</HI> As &s;oon as the Queen arrived there, &s;he put on a mo&s;t &s;um|ptuous Habit, then coming into the Hall, &s;he took part of a noble Collation: There &s;he &s;taid a little, and afterwards retired into her Cham|ber, after this &s;he a&s;cended a Scaffold, and placed her &s;elf in a Chair of State under a noble Canopy; at this very moment &s;he was &s;eized with an air of melancholy which &s;hewed what a regret
<PB N="106" REF="115">
&s;he had to be &s;o near leaving <HI>France.</HI> The Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> placed him&s;elf at her right hand, the Prince&s;s <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> at her left, the Mare&s;hal <HI>de Clerambaut</HI>'s Lady and Madam <HI>de Grance</HI> be|hind her Chair. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Saintot</HI> went to inform the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI> of it, who was <HI>Major Domo</HI> to the Queen. He was in a Boat upon the River, near a little I&s;land, which the Treaty of the <HI>Pyranees</HI> has rendred &s;ince &s;o fa|mous, and which was joyned to the Queen's Hou&s;e by a Bridge of Communication. The Guards <HI>de Corps</HI> formed them&s;elves into &s;everal Squadrons in this place. The Marque&s;s was waiting for his Orders in this Boat, which was very magnificent, and was prepared on purpo&s;e to carry her Maje&s;ty over to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was informed that the Queen expected him, he &s;et foot upon the ground, and four&s;core Per&s;ons, Gentlemen, Pages, or Valets marched on foot before him, he threw him&s;elf immediately at the feet of the Queen, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, made her a Complement, got up again, and covered him&s;elf, without &s;taying for the Queen to &s;ay any thing to him. The Prince <HI>d Harcourt</HI> covered him&s;elf likewi&s;e at the &s;ame time. The Marque&s;s &s;poke to her all the while in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and pre&s;ented her Maje&s;ty with two Letters from the King and Queen-Mother; but before he gave them, he touched them upon his Forehead, his Eyes, his Mouth, and his Heart, as the fa&s;hion is. The Queen told him &s;he was extreamly glad that the King her Husband had given him the charge of conducting her. After this the old Marque&s;s turned him&s;elf towards the Prince <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> and made him a Comple|ment, who an&s;wered that he had Orders from the King his Ma&s;ter to deliver the Queen of
<PB N="107" REF="116">
<HI>Spain</HI> into his hands. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chateauneuf</HI> Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> read the Act of Deliverance in <HI>French</HI>; and Don <HI>Alan&s;on, Carnero,</HI> Secretary of State, read the Act of Re|ception in <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> The Marque&s;s pre&s;ented &s;e|veral Per&s;ons of Quality to her Maje&s;ty, who ki&s;&s;ed her hand kneeling down upon one Knee. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pampelune</HI> ki&s;&s;ed her hand, but did not kneel. The Queen did not pre&s;s to depart, but the Marque&s;s informed her that it was high time to march; &s;he immediately aro&s;e, placing him on her right hand, and a <HI>Menin</HI> of Honour on her left, upon who&s;e &s;houlder &s;he leaned, for he was a young Boy, and thus &s;he advanced towards the Bridge. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> met her ju&s;t about the middle, and ki&s;&s;ed her hand with the Ladies of the Palace that followed her, who threw them&s;elves all at her Feet. After the Dutche&s;s had made her Com|plement, &s;he pre&s;ented &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies to the Queen. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Repaire,</HI> Lieutenant of the Kings Guards <HI>du Corps,</HI> who carried the Queens Train, gave it to the Dutche&s;s. The Queen entred into the Boat along with her, her Cham|ber was glazed all over; and thus being all a|lone with this old Dame, &s;he ca&s;t her eyes fre|quently towards that &s;ide of the Kingdom which &s;he had quitted, and her langui&s;hing air &s;ufficiently te&s;tified by what commotions &s;he was agitated within. Twenty four Seamen placed in two Barks drew the Boat along, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e di&s;charged their Mu&s;quetoons and Pi&s;tols as &s;oon as it began to move, the Ar|tillery of <HI>Fontarabia</HI> an&s;wered them with a great firing. The Prince and Prince&s;s <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> the other Ladies and all the Queens Attendants pa&s;&s;ed over in Boats that were prepared on
<PB N="108" REF="117">
purpo&s;e. The Queen &s;etting foot upon the Ground towards the evening, found her own Coach, her Litter, and a Chair with abundance of Men in Liveries; &s;he placed her &s;elf in her Chair, and twenty Valets on foot lighted the way with long Flambeaux of White Wax: when they came to <HI>Irun, Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung, and this was the fir&s;t time her Supper was &s;erved after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion; the repa&s;t was &s;o lit|tle and &s;o ill dre&s;t, that &s;he was extremely &s;ur|prized at it, and could &s;carce eat at all.</P>
<P>Alas! that a young Prince&s;s bred up in the mo&s;t magnificent and refined Court in the World &s;hould be forced to pa&s;s &s;o many &s;or|rowful melancholy moments. She had always had the liberty hitherto to eat in publick, and it had not been denied to her upon the way; &s;he danced, &s;he rode on Hor&s;eback, &s;he knew and e&s;teemed tho&s;e that were her Companions, and they (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) adored her. And now &s;he found her &s;elf all on a &s;ud|den among&s;t per&s;ons whom &s;he knew not; and con&s;equently could not appear amiable enough to divert her grief, &s;he under&s;tood &s;o very little of their Language, that &s;he could not tell what they meant, or return them any an&s;wer with|out trouble; then be&s;ides all this, the manner wherein they &s;erved her appeared &s;o &s;trange, and carried &s;o &s;mall a re&s;emblance to that of <HI>France,</HI> that &s;he was not a little di&s;compo&s;ed at it. All was Ceremony, all was Re&s;traint and Affectation; from the very fir&s;t day &s;he appear|ed among&s;t them, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> expected &s;he &s;hould know and do every thing as readily as them&s;elves, who had been learning them the better part of their lives. They never con&s;idered the difference between the two Nations, that
<PB N="109" REF="118">
are oppo&s;ite to one another in every punctilio, but believing that her Maje&s;ty ought immedi|ately to be made acquainted with their way of living, which &s;he was religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve for the re&s;t of her life, they di&s;pen&s;ed with her in nothing, &s;o that from that time &s;he &s;uffered a kind of &s;lavery, to which the rigid humour of her <HI>Camarera Major</HI> contributed very much; but the natural &s;weetne&s;s of the Queen's temper, and her prudence made her receive all the&s;e things, that naturally fatigued and di&s;plea&s;ed her, with a world of patience.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s one would have been apt to conclude, that out of meer policy the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> ought to have managed the good di&s;po&s;ition of the Queen after another manner, e&s;pecially &s;ince having no intere&s;t in her at pre|&s;ent, &s;he ought by a courteous deportment to have gained her favour, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;o great a number of con&s;iderable enemies; and the greate&s;t part of the Court Ladies were de|&s;irous of her place. The Prince who advanced her to this Po&s;t, was already dead, all appear|ances &s;eemed to predict her fall, and &s;he her &s;elf was very apprehen&s;ive of it. However &s;he took different mea&s;ures from what any body would have thought &s;he ought to ob&s;erve, for in&s;tead of &s;hewing any complai&s;ance to her young Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he became a &s;py upon her acti|ons, &s;o that by this means &s;he might merit the King's favour. She &s;tudied all her inclinations, and her humour, &s;he frequently cau&s;ed &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Women, that follow'd her to <HI>Madrid</HI> to be entertained, &s;he drew &s;trange con&s;equences from the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions, and every thing became poy&s;on in her hands. She likewi&s;e drew for her &s;elf a Plan of the conduct &s;he was to follow,
<PB N="110" REF="119">
and this effectually hindred her from being turn|ed out of her Po&s;t.</P>
<P>She was not only content with taking the&s;e remote mea&s;ures to ingratiate her &s;elf with the King, but likewi&s;e was of opinion, that to &s;e|cure her own intere&s;ts, &s;he was to hinder the young Queen from ever having any friendly corre&s;pondence with the Queen-mother, or re|po&s;ing any confidence in her: becau&s;e her party being ab&s;olutely oppo&s;ite to that of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> it was natural to believe that the fir&s;t &s;acrifice &s;he would demand of her Daughter-in-Law, would be the removal of the <HI>Camarera,</HI> who was the Creature of her Enemy. Be&s;ides &s;he could not flatter her &s;elf, that the young Queen would refu&s;e to give the Queen-Mother this proof of her complai&s;ance, at a conjuncture that would deliver her from a &s;ort of a Gover|ne&s;s, whom &s;he had no great rea&s;on to love; thus &s;he could not think of a better expedient to &s;upport her &s;elf, than by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Queen, <Q REND="inline">That the Queen-Mother was her &s;ecret enemy; that &s;he would oppo&s;e her in every thing; that &s;he could never forget that &s;he was in part the cau&s;e that the marriage of the Arch-Dutche&s;s her Grand-Daughter was not con&s;ummated with the King her Son; that &s;he was always unea&s;y becau&s;e &s;he had not that a&s;cendant, as &s;he de&s;ired over the King's affections; that &s;he was re&s;olved to keep her under a &s;ubjection that was more befitting a Daughter-in-Law, than the Spou&s;e of &s;o great a Monarch.</Q></P>
<P>To effect this more ea&s;ily, &s;he had in&s;truct|ed &s;ome per&s;ons that &s;tood very near the Queen, who acted their parts well enough. When they fir&s;t took the Liberty to di&s;cour&s;e her about this affair, &s;he thought them to be altogether
<PB N="111" REF="120">
devoted to her &s;ervice, and their pretended tears &s;eem'd to engage for the &s;incerity of their apparent zeal, <Q REND="inline">What have you lo&s;t Madam, would they &s;ay to her &s;ometimes with a mourn|ful air, What have you lo&s;t by the Death of Don <HI>Juan?</HI> What would not he have done to plea&s;e you? If it had not been for him the King had married the Arch Dutche&s;s, and his breaking off that Match drew abundance of mortal enemies upon him. Now if you could promi&s;e your &s;elf, that the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> would prove faithful to you, you might find &s;ome con&s;olation in him, you might fol|low his advice, and profit your &s;elf by his di|rections; but con&s;idering his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;iti|ons, Heaven pre&s;erve you, Madam, from ta|king his Coun&s;el: Alas, he quarrelled with Don <HI>Juan</HI> only upon the Queen Mothers ac|count, he clearly declared him&s;elf for her in his fir&s;t Emba&s;&s;ie, and &s;he repo&s;es an intire confidence in him. Thus your Maje&s;ty can|not &s;how your &s;elf too great a &s;tranger to &s;uch a Mini&s;ter, that will never go cordially along with you, and who will penetrate into your private &s;entiments for no other rea&s;on, than only to make an ill u&s;e of them.</Q> The Queen was extreamly alarm'd at the things they told her, and knew not which way to determine her &s;elf, being &s;o young, and having no experience in this new world, where &s;he was acquainted with no body.</P>
<P>She departed from <HI>Irun,</HI> and lay that night at <HI>Hernani.</HI> The next day &s;he mounted on Hor&s;eback, followed by the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> who made but a &s;orry figure upon her Mule; Madam <HI>de Grance</HI> accompanied her. The Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas,</HI> and the Duke <HI>d'O&s;|&s;one,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="121">
with each a pair of Spectacles upon their No&s;e, as is the fa&s;hion of the Grandees, bore their &s;hares in the Cavalcade. The Marque&s;s placed him&s;elf next her Maje&s;ty, becau&s;e &s;he was to be his charge till &s;he &s;aw the King; but the Duke pretended a Right to the &s;ame place, as being Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and &s;o took it by force, menacing the Marque&s;s very haughtily. This di&s;pute obliged the Queen to take Coach again. She lay that night at <HI>Tolo&s;itte,</HI> where as &s;oon as &s;he was arrived, the Duke <HI>d'O&s;&s;one</HI> ar|re&s;ted the Guard, who had abu&s;ed his Coach|man, becau&s;e he would not &s;uffer the Coach of the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI> to go before his. This quarrel was renewed upon the di&s;charging of their Offices; the Marque&s;s pretended, that all the honour of the Queens Reception belonged to him; the Duke maintained that he being Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, ought therefore to have all the pre-eminences in her Hou&s;e. To decide the matter, they were forced to write to the King about it, who decided it in favour of the Marque&s;s. The Duke not thinking him&s;elf ju&s;t|ly dealt with, continued his preten&s;ions &s;till, but this ob&s;tinacy drew an Order upon him to return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> with a prohibition to pa&s;s through <HI>Burgos,</HI> where the King was at that time.</P>
<P>In effect, the King left <HI>Madrid</HI> on the twen|ty &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> being but &s;lenderly accom|panied. The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> Lord Cham|berlain, the Con&s;table, and Don <HI>Jo&s;eph de Silva</HI> were all three in his Coach; as for the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> he did not go along with them, for he pretended that for want of mony he was not in a capacity to fit out any an&s;werable equipage; there might indeed be &s;omething of truth in this
<PB N="113" REF="122">
pretence, but it is certain, that his natural lazi|ne&s;s was the real occa&s;ion, he loved his plea&s;ure, he &s;hunned all trouble, and carefully avoided whatever might make him unea&s;ie, and this was the true rea&s;on why he did not meet the King and Queen till they were within a days journey of <HI>Madrid.</HI> The King continued fifteen days at <HI>Burgos,</HI> becau&s;e he was extreamly troubled with a Cold, in the mean time the Queen advanced forwards by &s;mall journeys. She wrote to him &s;everal times, and he an&s;wered her again. Her Maje&s;ty was forced to &s;end to him to demand leave to dine in publick, and &s;ometime to ride on Hor&s;eback; for tho&s;e two terrible Creatures the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas,</HI> and the <HI>Camerara Major</HI> would not con&s;ent to it, till they had received po&s;itive Orders. He granted it very freely, and &s;he &s;ent to him in this place a Watch be&s;et with Diamonds, and a Cravat with a Knot of a fire colour. He immediately put on the Cravat, and ordered five hundred Pi&s;tols to be given to the Gentleman who brought him the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>d'Altamire,</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> came to <HI>Ognate</HI> to complement the Queen from the King, and pre&s;ented her with a Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies. She arrived on the eleventh to <HI>Victoria,</HI> where a lamentable Come|dy was prepared to Regale her. There it was that &s;he dre&s;t her &s;elf fir&s;t <HI>&agrave; l'E&s;pagnolle,</HI> and &s;he appeared no le&s;s beautiful and charming in that, than in her <HI>French</HI> Habit. She went like|wi&s;e to the Great Church, where the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Calahorra</HI> received her at the Gate, and held the Canopy over her, &s;he afterwards was plea&s;ed to go and &s;ee a Bull-fea&s;t in the Market-place, but there was little or no magnificence in the &s;ight,

becau&s;e it was only performed by Citizens. She received in this place a pair of Pendants for the Ears, with Pearls to them of a Pear fa&s;hion, this Pre&s;ent was &s;ent to her from the Queen Mother, and was valued at four hundred thou|&s;and Livers.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> came to wait upon her at <HI>Bribie&s;ca,</HI> and tho' he tarried but a little time with her, and their Conver&s;a|tion was but &s;hort, yet he could very ea&s;ily ob|&s;erve that &s;he expre&s;t a great unea&s;ine&s;s, and a particular di&s;tru&s;t of him; he could not pene|trate into the rea&s;on of it, however he pre&s;ently judged that the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were not natural to her, he told her &s;everal things that might be &s;erviceable to her, he advi&s;ed her not to amu&s;e her &s;elf with the different impre&s;&s;ions that any per&s;ons might endeavour to make upon her, that &s;he ought to con&s;ider that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that waited on her only minded their own proper intere&s;ts, that her &s;ure&s;t way would be to love the King cordially, and &s;o by that means engage him to love her; to unite her &s;elf to the Queen Mother, and con|cert all Affairs with her; that &s;he ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied, that that Prince&s;s had a great kindne&s;s for her, and that if &s;he took care to make &s;uita|ble returns, &s;he would find the affections of a true Mother in her. The young Queen was already prepared for this di&s;cour&s;e, and parti|cularly for what concerned the Queen Mother. She had been tampered with upon that point before, but if &s;he had &s;eriou&s;ly examined what he &s;poke to her, &s;he had &s;oon been made &s;en&s;i|ble, as &s;he was a per&s;on of extraordinary wit, that the Amba&s;&s;ador dealt plainly with her, and that whoever per&s;waded her to the contrary,

endeavoured to di&s;unite her from her real in|tere&s;ts. He took his leave of her and went back to the King at <HI>Burgos,</HI> and during this &s;hort time he had the honour to di&s;cour&s;e with her, &s;he &s;till entertained him with great coldne&s;s and indifferency.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> was advanced as far as <HI>Burgos</HI> to &s;alute the King; and &s;ince the Queen was to come to <HI>Quintanapalla,</HI> which is within three leagues of it, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he would come to lie there on the nine|teenth of <HI>November,</HI> and that the Ceremony of the Marriage would be there &s;olemnized: But the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars,</HI> having met, as he was coming back, the Patriarch of the <HI>Indies</HI> who was going to meet the Queen it came imme|diately into his head, that the Marriage might perhaps be con&s;ummated, without his being in|formed of it; this thought made him inquire the news of Don <HI>Geronimo d'Eguya,</HI> Secretary of State, who only told him, that the Queen was expected the next day at <HI>Burgos.</HI> This doubt|ful an&s;wer, which had nothing po&s;itive in it, ob|liged our Amba&s;&s;ador to inform him&s;elf &s;till more particularly, and he under&s;tood at la&s;t that the King was to go the next day to <HI>Quintanapalla</HI> to celebrate the Marriage. Being a&s;&s;ured of this, he took care to &s;end advice of it to the Prince <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> and they departed together &s;oon enough to be with the Queen before the King arrived thither.</P>
<P>When they came there, they found it no diffi|ficult matter to di&s;cover, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> de&s;i|red to have the Marriage &s;olemnized without them. The <HI>Camerara Major,</HI> who was altoge|ther of that opinion, and to whom they &s;poke with abundance of hone&s;t freedom, told them
<PB N="116" REF="125">
coldly that they were not to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Cere|mony, and that the King would have no body be there, except only tho&s;e who&s;e pre&s;ence was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as the chief Offi|cers, and &s;ome Gentlemen of the Bed-Cham|ber. The Prinoe <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> an&s;wered, that the King their Ma&s;ter had given them Orders to be pre&s;ent at it. She fiercely replied, that the King their Ma&s;ter had nothing to do to command in <HI>Spain.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villars</HI> told her that the King his Ma&s;ter was u&s;ed to command his Amba&s;&s;adors, and that they would obey him in every thing, that if the King was not willing to have him a&s;&s;i&s;t at his Marriage, he ought to &s;ignify to them by an Or|der in writing that they were not to be there. The <HI>Camerara</HI> ravi&s;hed with joy that &s;he had an opportunity to &s;how her zeal for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> altho this was a very improper time for it, was &s;o far tran&s;ported with the matter, and &s;poke &s;everal things &s;o incoherent and fierce, that the Amba&s;&s;adors le&s;t her and addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI>; he pa|tiently li&s;tned to them, and told them ingenu|ou&s;ly that he would immediately di&s;patch a Gentleman to the King to know his plea&s;ure herein. This Gentleman found him on the way, and he con&s;ented that the Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> and <HI>Villars</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Ceremony. In &s;hort it was occa&s;ioned by the indu&s;trious dili|gence of &s;ome per&s;ons who had no inclination to the <HI>French,</HI> that this thought was in&s;inuated in|to the King: They were of opinion, that &s;o Au|gu&s;t a Marriage ought not to be Celebrated in a poor Village, where there were not above a dozen Hou&s;es, and their <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> vanity was &s;o extreamly offended at it, as to de&s;ire that the
<PB N="117" REF="126">
Amba&s;&s;adors of &s;o great a King might not be witne&s;&s;es of &s;o great a negligence, not to &s;ay mi&s;ery. And now, to excu&s;e the matter, they gave out that the King was young and amorous, that every thing that ha&s;tned the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his Spou&s;e touched him &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, that he even forgot the magnificence and grandeur of his Rank; that love alone made up the Honours of his Fea&s;t, and that the King thought this alone &s;ufficient. The Queen having pa&s;&s;ed the night at <HI>Quintanapalla,</HI> about ten a clock in the morn|ing was told that the King was arrived; this news cau&s;ed a &s;mall emotion in her, and &s;pread a colour upon her Cheeks that made her &s;till appear more beautiful and lovely. She went to receive him in her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dre&s;s, and having met him as he was ju&s;t going to enter her Anti-Chamber, &s;he would have thrown her &s;elf &s;e|veral times at his feet, and ki&s;&s;ed his hand, but he hindred her &s;till, and &s;aluted her after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, that is, without ki&s;&s;ing her, but pre&s;&s;ing her arms clo&s;e with his two hands, and calling her often <HI>Mireina, Mireina,</HI> my Queen, my Queen. They di&s;cour&s;ed together a long time, without being able to under&s;tand one an|other, and this was certainly no little pain to them. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villars,</HI> who perceived it, advanced forward to &s;erve as an Interpreter; if he did not &s;ay every thing they &s;aid, it is at lea&s;t very certain that he &s;poiled nothing of their conver&s;ation, and that he mingled a great deal of tenderne&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ion with it. The King was dre&s;t <HI>&agrave; la Scombergue,</HI> which is properly after the <HI>French</HI> mode, and all his attendants were clad after the &s;ame manner: For the cam|pagne habits of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;omewhat re&s;em|ble ours.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127">
The Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> having ob&s;erved that the Gandees of <HI>Spain</HI> took the right hand, &s;poke to the King about it, and repre&s;ented to him, the rank the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> had given to him at <HI>Fountainbleau,</HI> when the Queen was e&s;pou&s;ed there. This rea&s;on prevailed, &s;o the King ordered the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI> to be treated after the &s;ame manner. The Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> could not be brought to quit his place without &s;ome trouble; he had &s;till a &s;mall di|&s;pute upon the point, which continued a little time between the Amba&s;&s;ador and him, how|ever civility was &s;till pre&s;erved on both &s;ides, and the re&s;t of the Grandees placed them&s;elves be|hind the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">on <HI>Antonio de Benavidez y Ba|zan,</HI> Patriarch of the <HI>Indies</HI> and Grand Almo|ner gave them a &s;econd benediction; the Ce|remony was performed <HI>incognito</HI> in the Queen's Anti-Chamber: If the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> had not been indi&s;po&s;ed, he had performed this Office. Whil&s;t Ma&s;s was &s;aying they put a Ribbond of black Taffaty about the King and Queen, tied up in a true Lovers knot, and a white Gauze with a Silver Fringe upon the King's Shoulders, and over the Queen's Head. The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> held up her Train. When the Ceremony was over, the King and Queen withdrew into a Chamber by them|&s;elves, where they continued two hours alone: They dined afterwards in publick, and parted from thence to go and lie at <HI>Burgos.</HI> There was no body with them in the Coach, and &s;ince they did under&s;tand one another but very little, one can &s;carce imagine what they &s;aid, however the King appeared very amorous and affectio|nate; &s;everal Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> went before their Maje&s;ties with very &s;tately Liveries, and
<PB N="119" REF="128">
accompanied them to the Palace, where a Comedy was acted, and artificial Fireworks were to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The next day the King came to a rich Abbey of Nuns, that are called <HI>Las Huelgas,</HI> which is not much beyond the Suburbs of <HI>Burgos:</HI> She dined there, and about three a Clock made her entry on Hor&s;eback, being dre&s;t after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> mode, but appeared &s;o beautiful and charm|ing, that &s;he ravi&s;hed the hearts of all the Spectators. Three Grandees marched before her, the Marque&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas</HI> followed her; a Canopy was carried over her Head, the Old Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> rode upon a Mule, and the Maids of Honour accompanied her on Hor&s;eback. On the twenty &s;econd of <HI>No|vember</HI> Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> made his entry, and had Audience of the King and Queen; after Dinner there was a Bull-fea&s;t, which plea&s;ed the Queen exceedingly, becau&s;e the Cavaliers &s;howed extraordinary dexterity and courage in the performance. The day following &s;he &s;aw the <HI>Parejas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, an Hor&s;e-Race, in which nothing is ob&s;ervable, but that two men who &s;tart together, ride even without going a &s;tep one before the other, altho they ride full &s;peed: Sixty Gentlemen clad in Silver Brocard ran after this manner.</P>
<P>After they had thus &s;pent three days in dif|ferent plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions, it was high time to think of going to <HI>Madrid</HI>; mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen and Ladies that followed the Queen took leave of her in this place, &s;o that the greate&s;t part of the Hou&s;hold went back to <HI>France</HI>; but this was not done without &s;hedding abundance of Tears. The Queen had the li|berty &s;till to keep with her her two Nur&s;es, two
<PB N="120" REF="129">
Women of the Chamber, &s;ome <HI>Valets de Cham|bre,</HI> a Gentleman to look after five or &s;ix <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Hor&s;es &s;he had ordered to be brought with her, and &s;ome other Officers for her Table. She pre&s;ented the Prince and Prince&s;s <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> the Mar&s;hal <HI>d'Clarembaut</HI>'s Lady, and Madam <HI>de Grance</HI> with her Picture enriched with Dia|monds of different prices, according to the Qua|lity of the per&s;ons to whom &s;he gave them: and the obliging manner wherewith &s;he knew how to accompany her liberalities augmented the price of them exceedingly. They pretend that the Pre&s;ent the King made the Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> was worth twenty hundred thou&s;and Crowns, but it fell much &s;hort of it; the Queen got a Pen&s;ion of two thou&s;and Crowns for Madam <HI>de Grance,</HI> which was to be paid her where-ever &s;he lived.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s <HI>d'Harcourt,</HI> and the other La|dies that followed the Queen went back to <HI>France,</HI> while &s;he and the King took the way to <HI>Madrid,</HI> being both by them&s;elves, and &s;ate in the back part of the Coach.

<P><PB N="121" REF="130">
All the while that the Court was on the way from <HI>Burgos</HI> to this place, the <HI>Camerara Major</HI> frequently di&s;cour&s;ed the King in private: She found it no difficult matter to in&s;inuate tho&s;e &s;entiments into him, that are &s;o natural to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and he had for his &s;hare been educa|ted in a Country where they make no reckon|ing of a Ladies virtue, unle&s;s they take away from her all opportunities of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing: <Q REND="inline">She repre&s;ented to him the ill con&s;equences of that liberty which the Women are allowed in <HI>France</HI>; that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Queen to live after the retired manner that tho&s;e of her &s;ex ob&s;erve at <HI>Madrid</HI>; that &s;he was young, lively, and of a brillant &s;pirit, accu&s;tomed to the <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions; that what is innocent in one place may become criminal in another; but if he would be plea&s;ed to confide in her, &s;he would by her great dili|gence prevent every thing.</Q> The King com|mended her zeal, and gave her &s;ufficient a&s;|&s;urances of his confidence.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother was arrived at <HI>Torrejon</HI> before the King; &s;he quitted her Apartment to go and meet their Maje&s;ties; when the King &s;aw her, he ran to her and embraced her very tenderly; the young Queen advanced forward at the &s;ame time to ki&s;s her hand, but the Queen Mother would not &s;uffer it: She took her between her Arms, and embraced her &s;e|veral times with great te&s;timonies of friend&s;hip, treating her &s;till by the Name of <HI>her Maje&s;ty</HI>; but the young Queen told her, that &s;he re|que&s;ted her to call her Daughter, and love her as one, and to be per&s;waded that &s;he had all tho&s;e dutiful &s;entiments for her, that might make her worthy of this Honour. The King
<PB N="122" REF="131">
gave her his hand on one &s;ide, and the Queen Mother on the other; and thus going between them &s;he entred the Palace, that had been pre|pared to receive them. The Queen Mother perceiving that the Queen had never a Muff, pre&s;ented her with her own, about which was a great knot of Diamonds; afterward &s;he took from her a Ribbond that tied &s;ome of her Tre&s;|&s;es, and in exchange put upon her Arm a Brace|let that was computed to be worth three thou|&s;and Pi&s;tols. In a word, &s;he &s;howed the Queen all marks of her good inclinations to her, from which &s;he might promi&s;e her &s;elf all happy con&s;equences. She &s;taid with their Maje&s;ties as long as &s;he could, but went home that eve|ning, becau&s;e this place had not conveneincies enough to receive her. The next day which was the &s;econd of <HI>December,</HI> the King and Queen arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in a Coach with the Curtains open, that they might be &s;een by the people. They went down to our Ladies <HI>Dato|cha,</HI> where <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung, and at night lay at <HI>Buen-Retiro</HI>; the next day a Comedy was acted, and &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Mu&s;icians, that followed the Queen, prepared &s;ome <HI>Opera's.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> being re&s;olved to take entirely from the Queen that little liberty that remained to her, and de&s;iring to continue &s;ole Mi&s;tre&s;s of her Maje&s;ty's Will, declared when &s;he was arrived at <HI>Buen-Retiro,</HI> that no body, of what quality or condition &s;oever, &s;hould &s;ee the Queen till after &s;he had made her publick Entry. This was a &s;orrowful &s;tate, and a heavy re&s;traint to the young Queen to find her &s;elf thus all on a &s;udden &s;hut up from tho&s;e per&s;ons, that either might have afforded her &s;ome con&s;olation, or diver&s;ion, or u&s;eful advice.
<PB N="123" REF="132">
She kept her in this &s;olitary condition at <HI>Retiro,</HI> without permitting her &s;o much as to go out of her Apartment. All the entertainment they regal'd her with, was to &s;ee long ful&s;om tedi|ous Comedies, little of which they under&s;tood; and the terrible <HI>Camerara</HI> was ince&s;&s;antly before her eyes, with a &s;evere affected air, and never laught, but was perpetually finding fault with &s;omething or other. She was a profe&s;&s;ed ene|my to all manner of plea&s;ure, and &s;he treated her Mi&s;tre&s;s with as much Authority, as a Go|verne&s;s would u&s;e towards a little Girl.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> knew all that pa&s;&s;ed, and was mightily concerned at it, but it was not time as yet to &s;peak of it. He &s;ent to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI> to know whether he might have leave to &s;alute the Queen, &s;he an|&s;wered him ju&s;t as &s;he did all the re&s;t of the world, that &s;he was not to be &s;een till after the Entry was over. This an&s;wer he looked upon to be &s;o po&s;itive, that not de&s;irous to run the ri&s;que of meeting a &s;econd refu&s;al, he was &s;or|ced to acquie&s;ce: but the Queen being informed of what had happened by &s;ome of the French Women that &s;till continued with her, could not forbear to acquaint the King with it, and ob|tained leave to &s;ee our Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>de &s;ecreto,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as a private per&s;on. She imme|diately took care to inform him of it; and the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> imagining that &s;he might likewi&s;e have the favour of the &s;ame priviledge, &s;ent to the <HI>Camerara Major</HI> to know whether &s;he might be admitted to wait upon the Queen, but &s;he received the &s;ame an&s;wer that Mon&s;ieur the Amba&s;&s;ador had received from her before, &s;aying in a few words, &s;he had no order to let her in. The Gentleman that di&s;cour&s;ed the

<P>Her Maje&s;ty not knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed between the <HI>Camerara</HI> and the Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady, charged her Confe&s;&s;or to tell her, that &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, and that &s;he would extream|ly oblige her by making her a vi&s;it. But &s;he was not in a capacity to obey the Orders &s;he had received, and the Confe&s;&s;or being informed what ob&s;tacles &s;tood in the way, very fairly gave the Queen an account of all. She was not a little troubled at the ill &s;ervices the Dutche&s;s had done her; and one may be able to judge by the&s;e few in&s;tances what an ab&s;olute power that old Lady a&s;&s;umed in the Queen's Hou&s;e, and over the Queen's per&s;on. The Queen Mother, who came every day to <HI>Retiro,</HI> ob&s;erved an air of melancholy in the looks of the young Prin|ce&s;s, which &s;ufficiently te&s;tified her di&s;quietude within: She ea&s;ily apprehended, that a per&s;on of her age could not chu&s;e but be di&s;gu&s;ted at the &s;everity of the <HI>Camerara</HI>; &s;o &s;he thought her &s;elf obliged to acquaint the King with it, and de&s;ired him that he would be plea&s;ed to treat her after a more gentle method: She &s;ucceeded in her Petition, and procured leave for the Mar|chione&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> to go and wait upon the Queen, who was introduced into her Apart|ment through that of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra No|va,</HI> who appeared le&s;s &s;avage and &s;omewhat more re&s;pectful to her than &s;he u&s;ed to be. The King according to the cu&s;tom of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ate in a Chair of State, the two Queens upon two low Stools, and pre&s;ently another was brought for the Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady. Soon after the

<P>Madam <HI>de Villars</HI> &s;poke with a great deal of zeal of the Queen Mother; but the young Queen being not as yet di&s;ingaged from tho&s;e &s;enti|ments with which &s;he had been lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, looked upon all this di&s;cour&s;e as de&s;igned to mi&s;lead her, and tho &s;he ought to have con&s;i|dered that the Amba&s;&s;adre&s;s could have no other views in what &s;he told her, than only to make her &s;en&s;ible of her own true interre&s;ts, yet the&s;e advices did not at that time make tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions upon her, as one could have wi&s;hed they had for her good. Her prejudices to the Queen Mother, which were perpetually in&s;pi|red into her, ballanced the confidence &s;he had in Madam <HI>de Villars,</HI> and her mind, that was only accu&s;tom'd to be entertained with tho&s;e agreeable things, that u&s;e to employ per&s;ons of her youth, her temper that was naturally free and lively, di&s;&s;ipated the application &s;he ought to have made, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h good coun|&s;els from bad. She knew ju&s;t enough to embar|ra&s;s her and give her occa&s;ions of being unea&s;y, but could not tell how to di&s;intangle her &s;elf, and for want of a &s;teady re&s;olution to free her &s;elf from the&s;e melancholy Ideas, thought it too great a fatigue to &s;olve the&s;e apparent contradi|ctions. So &s;he continued under this uncertainty without being able to re&s;cue her &s;elf from it, and perhaps by this means lo&s;t a favourable jun|cture that then offer'd it &s;elf to deliver her from the Subjection, under which the Dutche&s;s kept her afterwards. The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI> &s;aw her &s;ometimes whil&s;t &s;he continued at <HI>Retiro,</HI> but this was before Company, and be&s;ides the time they allotted him to be with her, was &s;o

<P>The Queen Mother continued to vi&s;it the Queen often, &s;he de&s;ired her to dre&s;s her&s;elf af|ter the French fa&s;hion, becau&s;e &s;he never beheld her in that dre&s;s; &s;he did &s;o, and the Queen Mother liked it extremely well. When &s;he was returned to her Palace, which is the Hou&s;e of the Duke <HI>d'Uzeda,</HI> and is one of the fine&s;t in <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Young Queen &s;ent her two little Cabinets full of pretty curio&s;ities; &s;he on the other hand procured her by way of exchange the diver&s;ion of going a hunting at <HI>Pardo.</HI> She had not been on Hor&s;eback &s;ince &s;he came to <HI>Retiro.</HI> The King killed a wild Boar before her, and after that day they went frequently to the Cha&s;e together.</P>

<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>Sera</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> offer'd to make the <HI>Naples</HI> Squadron con&s;i&s;t of fourteen Gallies, which was never more than &s;even, and not put the King to any expence, provided he would allow him the &s;ame conditions that the Duke <HI>de Tur&s;is</HI> had at <HI>Genoa.</HI> He had made this propo&s;al to Don <HI>Juan,</HI> &s;ome time before his death, who found it to be very advantageous.

<P>There are &s;ome people in the world that are never to be di&s;countenanc'd by a repul&s;e, and Father <HI>Vintimiglia</HI> was of this number: Altho' he had received no manner of an&s;wer to the Memo|rial he gave the Prince <HI>d'Harcourt</HI> at <HI>Bayonna</HI> to pre&s;ent to the Queen, yet he could not forbear to draw up a &s;econd, wherein he regulated all the Monarchy; he intru&s;ted a French Gentle|man with it, who promi&s;ed to find out &s;ome means or other to give the Queen a &s;ight of it: But whether he &s;how'd it her, or not, 'tis cer|tain that <HI>Vintimiglia</HI> by an expre&s;s Order of the King was bani&s;hed out of all his Dominions.

<P>'Twas expected that immediately after the King's return &s;ome &s;ort of Government would be e&s;tabli&s;hed to &s;ettle affairs in their old cour&s;e, which had been intirely &s;u&s;pended ever &s;ince the Death of Don <HI>Juan.</HI> Ju&s;t as his Death hap|pened, every thing was making ready for the Journey, which employ'd all the Court, and the King in particular; his Marriage might well enough detain him &s;ome time from making tho&s;e applications he ought to u&s;e in the choice of an able Mini&s;ter: And the world was not at

all &s;urprized, to find him forget the concerns of the kingdom in general, at a time when he was wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Pa&s;&s;ion for his Queen; and had his head full of tho&s;e agreeable Idea's, which all Lovers amu&s;e them&s;elves with. But now when that bu&s;ine&s;s was over, they impati|ently expected to &s;ee him take up &s;ome fixed Re&s;olutions. The Queen Mother who was newly returned from her Exile thought of no|thing el&s;e than how to pre&s;erve her &s;elf in the favourable Situation &s;he in was in at pre&s;ent, and no body in a manner was &s;o intere&s;ted with the King as to be able to pretend to the Mini&s;try. Thus the whole government was lodged in the hands of a Monarch, who was but 17 years old, and who was never &s;o well ver&s;ed in things of le&s;&s;er con&s;equence as to have any ju&s;t know|ledge in greater Affairs.</P>
<P>The only man that &s;hared the Monarchy with him, was Don <HI>Jeronimo d'Eguya,</HI> who had been Secretary of State four years, to which po&s;t he arrived from that of a &s;imple Commi&s;&s;ary. His addre&s;s together with his good fortune render'd him agreeable to the King, who had followed no other Coun&s;el than his, unle&s;s <HI>d'Eguya</HI> who was fearful of giving it &s;ometimes, had not ad|vi&s;ed him to con&s;ult the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> in certain affairs, be|cau&s;e he had no mind to an&s;wer for every thing him&s;elf. It is indeed true, that during the Jour|ney nothing of importance was debated upon, for they only bu&s;ied them&s;elves about that in particular, and the Orders that are nece&s;&s;ary to be given upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Court became now very full; the King's marriage and the return of the Q. Mother had brought together the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons
<PB N="130" REF="139">
of the Kingdom. Every Family was con&s;ulting about the mea&s;ures that were to advance &s;ome particular man among&s;t them to the Chief Mi|ni&s;try: Some wi&s;hed their Relations had it, others de&s;ired it for their Friends, and abundance of people wi&s;hed to enjoy it them&s;elves: Among tho&s;e that had the ju&s;te&s;t preten&s;ions were reckoned the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi:</HI> They were both of them furni&s;hed with great per&s;onal qualities, were both of an illu&s;trious birth, and con&s;iderable for|tune; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the chief Offices of the Crown, were Coun&s;ellors of State, and their me|rits equally di&s;tingui&s;hed them: But nothing was more oppo&s;ite than the&s;e two Lords were to one another: An old Spirit of hatred, which they were not able to &s;uppre&s;s, and which they had te&s;tified in a thou&s;and Rencounters, increa&s;ed their common emulation; their humors and inclinations were as contrary as night is to day. Several of their common Friends had endeavour|ed to reconcile them, but their pains were to no purpo&s;e: They were all &s;en&s;ible that if they concerted matters together, they would recipro|cally render good Offices to one another, which might &s;erve to advance their Fortune. This was one of the rea&s;ons they u&s;ed to accomodate the matter between them; but &s;ometimes we meet with aver&s;ions that are never to be &s;urmounted, and this I have mentioned was of that num|ber.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> was 45 years old, his Humour &s;weet and good natur'd, but too &s;low and carele&s;s in matters of moment, of an in&s;inuating agreeable Spirit. He was de&s;cended of the illu&s;trious Hou&s;es of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>de Foix:</HI> he is &s;even times a Grandee of <HI>Spain.</HI> His Wife
<PB N="131" REF="140">
was Heire&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Arragon de Cardonne,</HI> &s;he is very rich on her &s;ide, as well as he is on his. He was Pre&s;ident of the Council of the <HI>Indies, Sommellor du Corps,</HI> that is to &s;ay, High Chamberlain, he made his Court regularly, and always te&s;tified a particular zeal for the per&s;on of the King; and his Maje&s;ty as he never fails upon that point, expre&s;&s;ed a certain affection for him, which he never &s;how'd to any one be|&s;ides. This made the world believe, that he &s;tood fairer for the Mini&s;try than all his Compe|titors.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> de&s;cended of the Hou&s;e <HI>de Vala&s;co,</HI> was 57 years old, and was Ma&s;ter of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, neverthele&s;s he did not live ea&s;y amid&s;t all his wealth; he is the tenth Hereditary Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> Dean of the Council of State, and Grand Ma|&s;ter of the King's Hou&s;hold. His Genius is va&s;t, his Abilities and Knowledge are &s;urpri|zing, and he was always concern'd in employ|ments, where he acquired experience. The la&s;t of his Governments was that of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and altho the&s;e po&s;ts ought to have made him &s;ociable and familiar, yet he always pre&s;erved &s;o &s;evere and rigid a character, that it rendred him terrible: acce&s;s to him is very difficult, and his humour is naturally &s;o imperious, that he can never &s;ubmit. And this is the rea&s;on why he was embroiled &s;o deeply with Don <HI>Juan,</HI> and hindring him from receiving &s;everal favours, which that Prince would otherwi&s;e have wil|lingly be&s;towed upon him, to have brought him over to his own Party. 'Tis true he declared him&s;elf very violently for the Queen Mother, and this might be one of the principal cau&s;es, that kept him from being of Don <HI>Juan</HI>'s Faction.
<PB N="132" REF="141">
No body doubted but that the King re&s;pected him very much, for what the Queen Mother might &s;ay in favour of him, and the world was per&s;waded, that among tho&s;e per&s;ons, who&s;e merits &s;he would recommend to the King, the Con&s;table would be the fir&s;t, who be&s;ides this would unque&s;tionably find him&s;elf &s;upported by all the party that had been ill treated by Don <HI>Juan,</HI> and by all tho&s;e that continued &s;till in the Intere&s;ts of the Queen Mother: She was obliged for her own proper Intere&s;ts to procure the Kings &s;avour, and the Favourite's place for the Con&s;table. But amid&s;t all the&s;e flattering ap|pearances, he &s;eemed to be very indifferent in the matter, whether it were becau&s;e the ill po|&s;ture of affairs, and the tender Age of the King, made him apprehend &s;ome danger to be in the chief po&s;t, or becau&s;e he was &s;en&s;ible that he had not a pro&s;pect of obtaining it at one &s;tep, and &s;o was willing to a&s;cend it by degrees. He &s;eem'd to de&s;ire that a Junto were e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Government, wherein he wou'd bear his &s;hare with the Inqui&s;itor General and the Mar|que&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era.</HI> He &s;ometimes told his Friends that the weight of great affairs a&s;toni&s;hed him, and that he found it a harder matter to adju&s;t them, than tho&s;e per&s;ons who behold them only at a di&s;tance, can well imagine; and that all his ambition was to contribute what in him lay to the erecting a Junto.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother was not unwilling to have this project take effect; becau&s;e this was the way to keep the entire Authority in her own hands; for the Council being compo&s;ed of her creatures, they would in all probability act ac|cording to her directions. The Con&s;table for his part &s;ecretly promi&s;ed, that by his conduct
<PB N="133" REF="142">
and management he would always keep the up|per hand over the other two, and that thus his Companions would only enable him to bear the publick hatred, in ca&s;e any thing &s;hould meet with ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But this Junto, that would lodge all the au|thority in the hands of three per&s;ons only, de&s;troy|ed at the &s;ame time the expectations of all tho&s;e that would have it be divided among&s;t more, out of a con&s;ideration of their own intere&s;t: This party de&s;ired to have it full as numerous as it was during the Regency, and would have it compo&s;ed of the Cardinal <HI>Portocarero</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> of Don <HI>Melchior Navarra,</HI> who had been formerly Vice-Chancellor of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> and the other three whom I have mentioned.</P>
<P>After &s;o many different projects, people were &s;o well &s;atisfied, that the Council at la&s;t would be only compo&s;ed of the Queen-Mother's Crea|tures, that the alarm became general to tho&s;e per&s;ons who had been devoted to Don <HI>Juan,</HI> and were very apprehen&s;ive of the credit of the Queen-Mother, and the advancement of the Con&s;table: Several of them a&s;&s;embled hereupon, they beheld their ruine in the elevation of the contrary party, and united them&s;elves to the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> to find protection from him, out of hopes of beholding him made Chief Mi|ni&s;ter: They con&s;idered that it would be more advantageous to them to &s;ee one man made happy, who was &s;ure to befriend them, than to &s;ee three happy per&s;ons depending upon one alone, who had ju&s;t rea&s;ons to wi&s;h them ill.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> was of an equal and peaceable temper, which rendred him agreeable to the King. This good fortune, which &s;eem'd

particular to him&s;elf, made him be looked upon by the greater part of the Courtiers as the only man that ought to pretend to this favour, in a Court where the greatne&s;s of rank and birth is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential qualities to recommend a Chief Mini&s;ter. Tho&s;e that penetrated into the true di&s;po&s;ition of the King, &s;aw very well that in the mid&s;t of the&s;e different parties, the Duke could not fail to get the better; but whether it was an effect of his Prudence and Moderation, or whether it was occa&s;ioned by the Intrigues of tho&s;e per&s;ons that were on the contrary &s;ide, he advanced but &s;lowly. It appears probable, that the greate&s;t part of his ambition came from his Friends, and that he rather followed the advices they in&s;pired into him, than his own proper in|clinations. <Q REND="inline">I de&s;ire the &s;ame thing that you do, would he &s;ay to them, but in truth the tran|quillity a man abandons to expo&s;e him&s;elf to all the murmurs of the people, and to all pub|lick inquietudes, very much moderates the plea&s;ure that is in&s;eparable from &s;o great a Po&s;t: and unle&s;s it were for the &s;ervice we hereby render to our Ma&s;ter, I can't imagine how any man could find any &s;atisfaction in a thing that draws &s;o many hazards along with it.</Q></P>
<P>Thus people bu&s;ied them&s;elves about the two different factions, that were formed by the Con&s;table, &s;upported by the Queen-Mother, and by the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> who was &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ended by all the Creatures of Don <HI>Juan:</HI> But while the&s;e Rivals were openly di&s;puting the Prize, and all the Court &s;eemed divided be|tween them, every one embracing a Party ac|cording to his own inclinations, Don <HI>Jeronimo d'Eguya</HI> formed a third almo&s;t alone. He &s;aw him&s;elf all on the &s;udden made Secretary of
<PB N="135" REF="146">
State, when the Marquis <HI>de Valenzuela,</HI> after the removal of F. <HI>Nitard,</HI> became the Queen-Mo|ther's Favourite, and took away that Office from Don <HI>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</HI> who did not be|have him&s;elf &s;upple and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive enough to him; &s;o that we may &s;ay his haughtine&s;s was the occa&s;ion of his Fall, <HI>Valenzuela</HI> having no rea&s;on to be content with him, obliged him to quit his Office, and be&s;towed it upon <HI>d'Eguya.</HI></P>
<P>He had too fre&s;h an example before his eyes to fall into the &s;ame fault, and being very a|droit, complai&s;ant, and well enough ver&s;ed in di&s;&s;imulation, neglected nothing to plea&s;e <HI>Valen|zuela</HI> as long as he &s;tood upon his feet: but when he &s;aw his Fortune declining, and that the Court declared in favour of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> he pre|&s;ently copied after them, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf, during that Mini&s;try, by his exemplary Submi&s;|&s;ion. He was one of the fir&s;t that e&s;pou&s;ed his party, and was likewi&s;e one of the fir&s;t that abandon'd the Prince, when he &s;aw his credit began to &s;ink in the world. Nay &s;ome time be|fore the end of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> he managed him&s;elf as he had done before <HI>Valenzuela</HI>'s fall, he entred into a corre&s;pondence with the Queen-Mother, a&s;&s;uring her that he would only depend upon her; &s;o whether &s;he was really per&s;waded of his &s;incerity, or had not as yet a fit occa&s;ion to re|move him from his Po&s;t, &s;he &s;uffered him to continue in it without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Changes he only held his place by a Commi&s;&s;ion; but as this furni&s;hed him with an occa&s;ion to &s;ee the King perpetually, and to di&s;cour&s;e him in private about all affairs, &s;o he made u&s;e of this opportunity to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with a di&s;tru&s;t of all tho&s;e that might with ju&s;tice make preten&s;ions to his &s;avour, nay even of the

mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons: So that being only a &s;imple Secretary of State by a Commi&s;&s;ion, and in all appearance of a narrow unexperienced Genius, he beheld him&s;elf in a capacity to bal|lance at one time two powerful Parties, &s;o that neither one nor the other could &s;ucceed in their affairs, &s;o long as he oppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>What&s;oever Inclinations the King had for the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> Don <HI>Jeronimo</HI> fru&s;tra|ted them, by awakening him with an Idea of Don <HI>Juan</HI>'s Mini&s;try: <Q REND="inline">The Slavery he then &s;uffered, the Per&s;ecution of the Queen-Mother, &s;o many Per&s;ons of quality ill u&s;ed without any occa&s;ion, the Mi&s;ery of the People, and many other di&s;orders that inevitably happen, when the Government is abandoned to the Caprice of one man: On the other hand he repre&s;ented a Junto to him, as a Company of Mini&s;ters that would command every body, and everla&s;t|ingly embarras their own affairs by their Jealou|&s;ies and mutual Di&s;cords; that it would be a burthen to him&s;elf, as well as unprofitable to the State; that Junto's might do &s;ome good under a Minority, but that his Maje&s;ty was too far advanced in Age, to want any Governors; that &s;uppo&s;e he were plea&s;ed to compo&s;e one, vet the obligation he had to make the Con&s;ta|ble one of the number, would involve him in new difficulties; that his temper was haughty and imperious in Authority, and that he was wholly devoted to the Queen-Mother; that &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to govern, and would ea&s;ily come to be Mi&s;tre&s;s again, by the help of a Junto compo&s;ed of her own Creatures; that &s;ince he was married, and had Prudence and Wit &s;ufficient, he ought to manage him&s;elf, and that if ever he was prevailed upon to do

otherwi&s;e, he would find him&s;elf by little and little reduc'd to tho&s;e &s;ufferings, from which he de&s;ir'd to free him.</Q></P>
<P>It is natural for a Young King to de&s;ire to be at large, and independent; &s;o whil&s;t he conti|nued thus in &s;u&s;pence, <HI>Eguya</HI> was Ma&s;ter of all affairs: The Confe&s;&s;or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with the &s;ame &s;entiments to chu&s;e no Chief Mini&s;ter, upon whom he mu&s;t depend: And the Dutche&s;s <HI>deTerra Nova</HI> found her&s;elf equally concerned to keep off the Queen Mother, a Junto, and a Favourite. During this Interregnum, &s;he had opportunity enough to fix and &s;ettle her&s;elf in the King's good opinion, &s;he did not que&s;tion but if the Q. Mother hapned to be once more Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would endeavour either by her&s;elf or by her Creatures to turn her out of the Court; this con&s;ideration obliged her to di&s;cour&s;e fre|quently with the King, and her only care was to per&s;wade him, that he ought to be apprehen|&s;ive of the Queen Mothers de&s;igns. She like|wi&s;e in&s;pired him with the &s;ame di&s;tru&s;t of the Queen, who&s;e Youth and Ea&s;ine&s;s of Temper made her uncapable of taking &s;trict mea&s;ures: She con&s;tantly whi&s;pered &s;ome di&s;agreeable things or other into his Ear, that only tended to di&s;quiet him; but he pre&s;erved &s;o great a Love for his Queen, that nothwith&s;tanding he believed all the Stories this old Beldam told him, he ne|ver had the le&s;s affection and tenderne&s;s for her.</P>
<P>The Court continued &s;till at <HI>Buen-Retiro,</HI> that is to &s;ay without <HI>Madrid,</HI> expecting the Queen to make her Entry, after which they were to go and lodge in the Palace; the preparations for her Entry were very long, it was commonly believed for &s;ome time that the Queen was with Child, but all the&s;e hopes vani&s;hing about the

About eleven the Queen mounted on Hor&s;eback, tho&s;e that were to go before began to march, and pa&s;&s;ed through a marble Gate, which was but lately built: The Kettle Drums and the Trumpets of the City, in their Habits u&s;ed in the&s;e Ceremonies, marched at the head of all; after them the Alcaldes of the Court, the Nobility, the Knights of the three Military Orders, the Gentlemen of the King's hou&s;e, the Mayor domo's to the Queen, and the Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> followed by great number of Lacquays, who&s;e different Liveries of Brocard, and Galloon of Gold and Silver of a mixt colour, made an agreeable diver&s;ity; the Querries of the Queen marched on foot immedi|ately before her: the Count <HI>de Villa Mayana</HI> was on her Right hand, who was her Chief Gentle|man U&s;her: She was &s;urrounded with her Me|nins and Pages of Honour (when &s;he walks on foot &s;he always leans upon one of them) the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra nova</HI> followed her; and Donna <HI>Loura de Alargon</HI> Governante of the Maids of Honour, both of them mounted upon their Mules, and in their Widdows habit; which &s;omewhat re&s;embles that of Religious Women, except that when they are on Hor&s;eback, they wear great Hats on their Heads, which made

She wore on her finger the great Diamond of the King, which, as they pretend, &s;urpa&s;&s;es in beauty any thing, of that nature that was ever &s;et in a Ring.

There were abundance of the&s;e Lords who for nine days together had nine different Liveries, and each finer than the other; after this manner they went to our Ladies <HI>Datocha,</HI> and it being already night before they returned to the Palace, white wax Tapers were lighted at all the Windows, and the Streets were &s;o prettily illuminated, by them, that a man might almo&s;t &s;ee from one end of the City to the other.

Many other diver&s;ions la&s;ted for &s;everal days; &s;ometimes their Maje&s;ties went a hunting, at other times to a Comedy, or took a Walk: Sometimes they went to Sup with the Queen Mother, or the Queen Mother came to eat with them at the Palace.

<P>I Am of opinion, Madam, that I cannot &s;end you better news to day, than that of the marriage of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Blois</HI> with Mon&s;ieur the Prince <HI>de Conty.</HI> The Contract of the Marriage was &s;ign|ed on the fifteenth of this month in the King's Cham|ber, who went about &s;even a Clock at Night to the Queens Apartment, and afterwards returned to his own with all the Royal Family: The Prince <HI>de Conty</HI> led Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Blois</HI>; &s;he was &s;et out with the fine&s;t Jewels in the world, all which together did not glitter &s;o brightly as her Eyes, and who&s;e lu&s;tre was inferiour to the Lillies and Ro&s;es of her Complexion.

her &s;elf of tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions with which &s;ome people had po&s;&s;e&s;t her again&s;t her; but &s;he unhap|pily imagining, that the other &s;till regretted the Arch-Dutche&s;s, and would have been glad to &s;ee her in her place, that opinion made her ex|treamly di&s;tru&s;tful: and the Queen Mother who found nothing of that openne&s;s of heart and freedom as &s;he de&s;ired, was likewi&s;e trou|bled for her part: for in effect, &s;he loved her tenderly, and was ready to give her all po&s;&s;ible te&s;timonies of her affection.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France,</HI> his Lady, and the Confe&s;&s;or often reminded the Queen of that conduct &s;he was to ob&s;erve, if &s;he intend|ed to be happy. <Q REND="inline">They told her, that &s;he ought to give her &s;elf intirely up to the Queen her Mother in Law out of a principle of Duty, and Gratitude for the friend&s;hip &s;he &s;howed her, as out of a con&s;ideration of her own proper intere&s;ts: they repre&s;ented to her, that the Queen Mother ought not to be &s;u&s;pected by her, and that altho the Arch-Dutche&s;s was her Grand Daughter, yet &s;he had received &s;uch few tokens and a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip from the Emperour during her di&s;grace, that &s;he was too &s;en&s;ible ever to forget it: that the Con|duct of <HI>France</HI> towards her was directly oppo&s;ite to this, that there &s;he had been pitied and obli|ged, that her Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had over pre&s;erved a &s;trict corre&s;pondence and friend|&s;hip with her, and that the Queen Mother knew well enough that &s;he could not by any returns oblige the Queen of <HI>France</HI> more, than by &s;howing back all that kindne&s;s to the young Queen of <HI>Spain</HI>; that &s;he had all the agree|ments in her, which could engage her heart; that be&s;ides this &s;he hoped to &s;ee her give an

Heir to the Crown, that this was nece&s;&s;ary for the good of <HI>Spain</HI>; that the melancholy humour, to which &s;he abandoned her &s;elf, might hinder her from having one; that they ought to concert all their affairs together, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the good graces and inclinati|ons of the King; that it was natural to be|lieve, he would divide his power between his Mother and his Queen, rather than be&s;tow it upon a Favourite, who would think of &s;erving him no longer than his Family reaped advan|tage by it; whereas the Souls of Sovereigns, having &s;omething in them that was more noble and great, than tho&s;e of private per&s;ons, the motives of Intere&s;t would never be &s;uppo|&s;ed to influence two Queens, &s;o much as they would a Chief Mini&s;ter; that in fine there ought to be no &s;eparation between them, but that they mu&s;t begin with the union of their hearts.</Q></P>
<P>The Queen reli&s;hed the&s;e rea&s;ons, and found them plau&s;ible enough, but for all that &s;he re|lap&s;ed all on a &s;udden into her old di&s;tru&s;t, into which the different things that had been &s;aid to her did ca&s;t her anew: Be&s;ides the extream trouble &s;he &s;uffered from the rigid conduct of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova</HI>; &s;he found her &s;o ab&s;olute and inflexible that &s;he began to fear her, to which the tenderne&s;s of her youth, her want of experience, and her natural &s;weetne&s;s contributed not a little, &s;o that &s;he could not open her &s;elf to the Queen-Mother, when &s;he con&s;idered, that if &s;he did not really love her, but would make invidious reflections upon what &s;he &s;aid, this would be the way to throw her in|to new inconveniencies; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding the de&s;ire &s;he had to &s;peak to her, &s;he was al|ways

&s;ilent in her company. The Queen-Mo|ther perceived it well enough, yet for all that &s;he continued to vi&s;it her almo&s;t every day, and &s;ent her pre&s;ents from time to time.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the young Queen being entirely van|qui&s;hed by all the&s;e demon&s;trations of amity, re&s;olved to &s;ubmit her &s;elf wholly to her di|rections. They had a long conference together, where they took tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they judged were nece&s;&s;ary to promote their common &s;atisfaction. After this the Queen Mother &s;poke to the King, but found him in a cold re|&s;erved humour, &s;o &s;he made him no di&s;coveries of any thing, but took her opportunity to with|draw, imagining with her &s;elf that her Son would be obliged to come after her; and that the world might take le&s;s notice of this alteration, &s;he gave out that &s;he only de&s;ired to live ea&s;y, and that &s;he preferred her own repo&s;e to all other con&s;iderations what&s;oever: She talked af|ter this rate before &s;everal per&s;ons, in whom &s;he repo&s;ed no ordinary confidence, altho at the bottom &s;he was clearly of a different opinion.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table was the fir&s;t man that was aware of this alteration, and was one of tho&s;e who were mightily troubled at it. He ea&s;ily &s;aw that the Queen Mother was leaving all thoughts of advancing him, and as he had his own particular views, &s;o he u&s;ed all the means in the world to effect his de&s;igns. In fine, he joined intere&s;ts with the <HI>Camarera major,</HI> Don <HI>Jeronimo d'Eguya,</HI> and the King's Confe&s;&s;or, who brought the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> into the &s;ame confe|deracy: the de&s;ign of the&s;e three la&s;t was to &s;et up the Con&s;table again&s;t the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> who&s;e favour with the King increa&s;ed, as they thought, very fa&s;t, and this gave them vi|olent

<P>Don <HI>Jeronimo de Eguya</HI> was the fir&s;t per&s;on whom he attacked. Having repre&s;ented to them one day in a full Council, and that with the greate&s;t fiercene&s;s in the world, how all affairs went from bad to wor&s;e, he added, that no body ought to be &s;urprized to find it &s;o, &s;ince <HI>d'Eguya,</HI> who pretended to manage every thing, had neither Judgment, nor Experience, nor Ca|pacity, and that he ought to be confined to the Duties of his Po&s;t, without medling with tho&s;e things that had no relation at all to it. When he had ended his di&s;cour&s;e, Don <HI>Manuel de Lira,</HI> Secretary of State of the Council of <HI>Italy,</HI> who was of the Con&s;table's Faction, pre&s;ented to them at the &s;ame time a large memorial, in which he laid open the va&s;t prejudice which the State of Affairs received from the ill conduct of <HI>de Eguya,</HI> and mo&s;t of them there had been well enough &s;atisfied, if the&s;e complaints had obliged the King to remove him.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Manuel de Lira</HI> did not act only out of Complai&s;ance to the Con&s;table but had his own private ends. He imagined that if <HI>d'Eguya</HI> were once turned out of his Po&s;t, he might perhaps &s;ucceed him in it. Now nothing animates a man's zeal in any affair, more than the pro&s;pect of &s;ome advantage or other to be gained by it. However this &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s did not meet with that &s;ucce&s;s which he and the Con&s;table propo&s;ed to them&s;elves, &s;o after long con&s;ideration the Con&s;table was obliged to come back to the Queen Mother, and importune her to appear in

favour of him. He repre&s;ented to her, <Q REND="inline">That if the chief Mini&s;ter was not one of her party, her repo&s;e would not be of long continuance; that the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> &s;tood very fair for it, and altho he advanced in&s;en&s;ibly, yet it was probable he would &s;oon find him&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a place where he would make his Ene|mies &s;everely feel the weight of his Indignation; that in &s;pight of Politicks, to which he pretend|ed, he would not fail to &s;et up the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> again&s;t her, who was a Creature of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> and always ready to execute tho&s;e re&s;ent|ments that had lodged in his brea&s;t &s;o long; that this Duke was the very per&s;on who for|merly had the hardine&s;s to carry her the Order for her Exile; that he &s;eem'd at that time to rejoyce at her misfortunes and perplexities: that if ever he came to be Favourite, &s;he would find him to be a con&s;tant rub in her way, and that this conjecture perhaps was not ill ground|ed, &s;ince the Duke &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the pa&s;&s;i|ons of Don <HI>Juan.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Queen Mother was alarmed at what the Con&s;table repre&s;ented to her, and gave him her word to act vigorou&s;ly in his behalf; but the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> being adverti&s;ed of it, was re&s;olved to prevent the blow, and judged it the be&s;t expedient to &s;often the Spirit of the Queen Mother, by making a profound Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to her. In fine he went to her, and told her, <Q REND="inline">That he was re&s;olved to be oblig'd to her for all the King's favours, and de&s;ired to depend upon her out of an obligation of Gra|titude, as he had done a long time ago out of Duty and Inclination; that he humbly begged of her to do him the ju&s;tice as to believe, that his Heart, his Birth, and his Fortune, were too

great ever to &s;uffer him to be one of Don <HI>Juan</HI>'s Creatures; that he would never receive that title but from his own Ma&s;ter, and that the Party mu&s;t wear a Crown who commanded the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI>; that altho he had declared him&s;elf for the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> yet it was not out of a Con&s;ideration of Don <HI>Juan,</HI> but the King's Service, and he was ready to abandon his Intere&s;t at any time, having no particular engagements of Friend&s;hip to him; and that if he appeared in this affair, it was only done with a de&s;ign to defend the Autho|rity of the King, which the Nuncio had a mind to invade in the conduct which he u&s;ed towards the Pre&s;ident.</Q> The Queen Mother an&s;wered him, that &s;he did not without a great &s;atisfaction, believe what he &s;aid to be true, that &s;he had a great e&s;teem for him, and would not fail to give him convincing proofs of it in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table being informed on his &s;ide, that Queen Mother had very favourably receiv|ed the Submi&s;&s;ion of the Duke, whether out of a Spirit of kindne&s;s, or indifference to the choice the King might make of a Chief Mini&s;ter, di&s;|paired at la&s;t of &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;ucceed in any of his projects, either of the Junto whereof he pretended to be a Member it one were erected, or in the place of Favourite which he could have de&s;ired rather to fill alone. He re&s;olved to me|rit &s;omething at lea&s;t of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> by yielding up that Po&s;t with a good grace, when he was in a capacity to di&s;pute it with him &s;till.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he laid hold of the fir&s;t opportunity he could find, to tell the King that no Per&s;on was fitter to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, and pre&s;erve

the Government in good order, than the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi.</HI> He be&s;towed wonderful com|mendations upon him for the good conduct he had ever u&s;ed; The free uncon&s;trained manner wherein he &s;poke all this, was exceeding re|markable, e&s;pecially in a man of the Con&s;tables haughty Temper, who, as the world imagined, would dye a thou&s;and times, rather than offer this violence inwardly to him&s;elf: But people at la&s;t believed that he de&s;ign'd to render him&s;elf agreeable to the King, by commending a man, for whom his Maje&s;ty te&s;tified &s;o great an In|clination. After all, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that he &s;howed a genero&s;ity, which is not common, in treating his declared Enemy after this man|ner.</P>
<P>It cannot be ea&s;ily imagin'd, what a great detriment the Republick received by the&s;e Factions of the Courtiers, and the King's Irre&s;o|lution to take or not to take a Chief Mini&s;ter. Nothing was concluded, nothing was done; a Spirit of Lethargy &s;eemed to be predominant at Court, which helped to increa&s;e tho&s;e per|plexities, under which the Kingdom laboured before. Every body langui&s;hed to &s;ee what would be the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;malle&s;t matters; and bu&s;ine&s;s that had been carried into the Council, tarried there whole years, nay things that went directly into the King's hands were di&s;patched never the &s;ooner.

<P>Our Amba&s;&s;ador who promi&s;ed him&s;elf to find a better treatment than he had met with a long while, and which he dexterou&s;ly di&s;&s;embled in expectation of the Queen's arrival, perceived at la&s;t that they de&s;igned to &s;atisfie him no

better, than the other Mini&s;ters, who made their Complaints. Above five Months were pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he demanded Ju&s;tice for &s;ome vio|lations of the Peace that were lately committed as well by the Governors of the Provinces, as by the taking of &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, and the burn|ing of others. But at the time when he was urgent to have a po&s;itive an&s;wer, he received a new injury by the in&s;olence of an <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Who is a kind of a Provo&s;t or Judge.</NOTE>Alcade, and &s;everal <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are Serjeants and Bayliffs.</NOTE>Alguazils who pa&s;&s;ed before his Hou&s;e, which was never done at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the quarter belonging to an Amba&s;&s;ador. He was extreamly &s;urprized at it, but was &s;o far from receiving the &s;atisfaction that was due to him for this affront, that they told him his Ma|je&s;ty had given Order that his quarter &s;hould be no longer exempt. This Re&s;olution &s;o much the more di&s;gu&s;ted him, becau&s;e it affected only him&s;elf, and all the other Amba&s;&s;adors enjoyed their Priviledges as formerly. Not but that they had &s;everal other complaints upon their Hands, as for example, the Envoy from the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> made a great noi&s;e becau&s;e they had amu&s;ed him a long time with &s;pecious promi&s;es that had no effect at all; they ow'd his Ma&s;ter a great Sum of Money, he demanded the payment of it, but they &s;hifted him off from time to time, &s;o that at la&s;t he perceived that they neither had the power nor inclination to &s;atisfie him. The Nuncio did not &s;eem to be le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ted for his part, becau&s;e he &s;aw the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> keep his Place and continue &s;till in Favour, altho
<PB N="158" REF="169">
the Pope had declared him &s;u&s;pended, and he him&s;elf omitted no application to have ju&s;tice done upon him.</P>
<P>In the mean time they wanted mony to rai&s;e four <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiments that were de&s;ign|ed to be &s;ent to <HI>Milain,</HI> becau&s;e they apprehend|ed &s;ome motion from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> but it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to find any funds, and be&s;ides this the Silver that came from the <HI>Indies</HI> in the <HI>Flota</HI> was &s;o &s;uddenly gone and with &s;o little order, that no body knew what was become of it, &s;o that it was a difficult matter to &s;end any returns into <HI>Flanders,</HI> or other places, where there was occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e that u&s;ed to advance mony upon the&s;e &s;orts of occa&s;ions, would now do nothing at all, they were all of them drained, and the nece&s;&s;ities were generally &s;o great, that they knew not where to take up mony to defray the ordinary expences of the King and Queens Hou&s;e. This proceeded in part from the di&s;|order of the mony; a Pi&s;tole which ought to go for no more than fourty eight <HI>Reals de Vellon,</HI> was rai&s;ed up to a hundred and ten; and the Patacoons that are only worth twelve <HI>Reals</HI> went at the rate of thirty. The occa&s;i|on of it was this, a great part of the <HI>Reals de Vellon,</HI> that are of Copper, were bad, and the common cu&s;tom made them pa&s;s as well in commerce, as if they had been good. But at la&s;t they were called in all on the &s;udden, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive price a Pi&s;tole was rai&s;ed to, and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to recount the di&s;orders and inconveniences that attended this new Regulation. The Court was of opinion in the month of <HI>Februrary</HI> 1680. that there was a nece&s;&s;ity to find out &s;ome remedy or other
<PB N="159" REF="170">
&s;uddenly for it; &s;o a Pi&s;tole from a hundred and ten <HI>Reals,</HI> was levelled to fourty eight, the Patacoons to twelve, and the other mony was &s;o confounded one with the other, that it was reduced to the eighth part of the or|dinary value. There was no body almo&s;t but lo&s;t more or le&s;s upon the account of this new Regulation, and accordingly felt it; that which before the &s;inking the value of the mony was worth fourty <HI>Reals,</HI> which make four Livers of <HI>French</HI> mony, &s;ince the reducing of it, was worth a hundred and ten <HI>Reals,</HI> which is ten Livers of our mony; &s;o that what Commodities a man could buy on <HI>Monday</HI> for fifty Sous, went on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> for above a third part more; and the Debtor, who, it may be, on <HI>Saturday</HI> owed twenty thou&s;and <HI>Reals de Vellon,</HI> which made but two hundred Pi&s;toles, found to his &s;orrow the next day after that he owed near five hundred Pi&s;toles. This ruined a great number of Fa|milies, and cau&s;ed a mighty dejection in the &s;pirits of the people; for every thing a man has occa&s;ion to buy, is dearer by much in <HI>Madrid</HI> than any where el&s;e, becau&s;e they are brought a great way off, and there are few or no Manufactures at all in that part of the Country. A kind of a mutiny happened at <HI>Toledo,</HI> becau&s;e after this &s;inking the value of mony, no care was taken to regulate the price of Provi&s;ions, for which they paid exce&s;&s;ive rates. It is &s;till to be noted, that the Civil Government in <HI>Spain</HI> is managed but after a very &s;orry manner, and that the &s;low lazy humour of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who might, if they plea&s;ed, correct the ill conduct of others, con|tributes exceedingly to the publick lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171">
All the&s;e di&s;orders and continual complaints, which made a noi&s;e from all quarters, began at la&s;t to &s;hake and undermine Don <HI>Jeronimo d'Eguya.</HI> He knew very well, that the Po&s;t where|in he &s;tood, was tickli&s;h and dangerous, and that after all his endeavours to di&s;gu&s;t the world, in ca&s;e he remedied nothing, the oblige maledi|ctions and hatred would fall upon the Favourite. The pre&s;ent ill &s;tate of affairs was attributed to his ill conduct, &s;o he thought within him&s;elf, that he could not too &s;oon deliver him&s;elf from the torrent of the popular fury, and therefore re&s;olved to omit nothing, whereby he might in|cline the King to choo&s;e a Chief Mini&s;ter. The con&s;ideration of his own intere&s;t &s;oon determi|ned him to act vigorou&s;ly in favour of the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> he knew the King had a parti|cular affection for him, and be&s;ides he per&s;wa|ded him&s;elf, that when the Duke was informed what good offices he had done him, he would maintain him &s;till in his Po&s;t, as well out of a principle of acknowledgment, as for the great &s;ervices he might do him in the&s;e affairs, &s;ince he had managed them for &s;o long a time, and con&s;equently was in a capacity to furni&s;h him with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary lights, which all tho&s;e per|&s;ons that newly enter into the Government are altogether unacquainted with. And then he knew the natural &s;weetne&s;s of the Duke's temper would never permit him to turn him out of his place, and he was certain that as long as he continued in it, he could manage the King's favour, the functions of his place giving him opportunity to approach near the King's per&s;on very often.</P>
<P>The <HI>Camarera Major,</HI> and his Maje&s;ty's Con|fe&s;&s;or had each of them particular de&s;igns in their
<PB N="161" REF="172">
head, however they were both agreed as to the Duke's advancement, &s;o that all the world con|curring with the favourable di&s;po&s;itions which the King had for him, he &s;igned a Decree (that is the u&s;ual term with them in <HI>Spain</HI>) wherein he declared the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> to be Chief Mini&s;ter. He immediately commanded Father <HI>Relux</HI> to carry it him, who came to his Hou&s;e about ten a Clock at night on the twenty fir&s;t of <HI>February</HI> 1680, and acquainted him with the good news.</P>
<P>No body had any rea&s;on to be &s;urprized at the Duke's elevation. It &s;eems he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf the Place &s;ome time before, whether it were becau&s;e the King gave him his promi&s;e, or that &s;ome outward appearances a&s;&s;ured him of it.</P>
<P>However it was, it was agreed upon by all hands at Court, that the King could not have made a better choice. He was a Per&s;on in whom all good qualities were to be found; his agreeable Conver&s;ation, his obliging Cha|racter, his noble and generous Deportment, his free ea&s;ie Temper, made him beloved by all the world: People only wondred, that being &s;o great a Lord as he was, he would &s;acrifice his repo&s;e to the Admini&s;tration of Affairs, that were then in a mi&s;erable condition. They could &s;carce imagine (and perhaps he was of the &s;ame opinion him&s;elf) how he could ever be able to remedy evils of &s;o inveterate a ma|lignity. Before he could effect this, he mu&s;t in all appearance make an intire Change in the ordering of the Monarchy; but this was an impracticable de&s;ign, and impo&s;&s;ible to be exe|cuted.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="173">
As &s;oon as the Choice his Maje&s;ty had made in favour of the Duke, came to be publickly known; all Per&s;ons that were of any Quali|ty went to complement him, as well the Mi|ni&s;ters of foreign Princes, as the Grandees of <HI>Spain.</HI> The next day being accompanied by all his Friends and Relations, he repaired to Court to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's hand, and thank him mo&s;t humbly for all his great favours. On the following days he received vi&s;its in his Bed, pretending a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition to ex|empt him&s;elf from the fatigue of Ceremonies. His Apartment and Furniture were extreamly magnificent, but it is an odd &s;ight to &s;ee a <HI>Spaniard</HI> in his Bed of State, becau&s;e they wear no Morning-Gowns here, but only their <HI>Go|lilia</HI> and black Cloaks, and have their Hats on, or el&s;e are bare-headed; for the Men as well as the Women wear no Caps: He had en|joyed the place of <HI>Sumiller de Corps, i. e.</HI> Lord-Chamberlian for a long time, and in this Qua|lity he was the only Per&s;on that commanded in the King's Chamber, and lay there.</P>
<P>He did not delay to give publick Audience in the Hall, which they call the <HI>Rubis,</HI> and is the place where the Council of State u&s;es to a&s;&s;emble; 'tis under the King's Apartment. Here it was that the Duke received the vi&s;it of the Nuncio and the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; they did not &s;eem to be plea&s;ed at the man|ner wherein the Chairs were di&s;po&s;ed, becau&s;e it could not ab&s;olutely be determined whether either of them or he had the Chief Place of Honour. Be&s;ides this, he only reconduct|ed them to the middle of the Hall of Au|dience. They acquainted the Marque&s;s <HI>de Villars</HI> with it, who told them that he had de&s;igned
<PB N="163" REF="174">
to make that vi&s;it along with them, becau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Chappel generally ac|quit them&s;elves of the&s;e &s;orts of devoirs to|gether, but that he was not di&s;plea&s;ed with him&s;elf for not being there, &s;ince he was re|&s;olved to take direction by the fault they had committed; and that he would not neglect, as they did, to u&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary precautions about the Step, Place and Rank, and would be a&s;&s;ured both of the one and the other be|fore he performed that Ceremony. In &s;hort, he &s;ent to the Duke to know whether he would not receive him, as Don <HI>Louis de Haro</HI> u&s;ed to receive the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI>; he imme|diately agreed to it, and that there might be no mi&s;takes committed, the places were marked out, and every thing was adju&s;ted before the day of Audience. The other Amba&s;&s;adors were concerned at the over&s;ight they had committed, and by this vi&s;it of our Amba&s;&s;ador, regulated tho&s;e they continued to make to the Chief Mini&s;ter.</P>

<P>About this time Don <HI>Franci&s;co d'Agourto</HI> was nominated by the King to be Ma&s;ter of the Camp-General of the Cavalry. The Envoy extraordinary from <HI>England</HI> &s;urprized all the Court by the &s;trict Prohibition he gave his Do|me&s;ticks not to &s;uffer any Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks or Re|ligious to come within his doors.</P>
<P>The young Queen was &s;o taken up with the diver&s;ions of the Carnaval, that &s;he had &s;carce opportunity to perceive that this was a

&s;et time of mirth and jollity: Her be&s;t days were &s;pent in hunting with the King, and the three la&s;t days of the Carnaval there was a Comedy repre&s;ented upon the Theatre at <HI>Buen-Retiro,</HI> which is a well-contrived Build|ing. The King and the Queen &s;aw it on the <HI>Sunday,</HI> the next day it was acted before the &s;everal Councils, and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> before the Officers of the City. The Queen being in|formed that the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Bejar,</HI> and the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Ca&s;tel Rodrigo,</HI> who had never bore any Children before, were each of them delivered of a Son, begged leave of the King to &s;end them word that &s;he wi&s;hed them joy: <Q REND="inline">I agree to it, &s;ays the King &s;miling, on con|dition that within nine months they will come in their turn to perform the &s;ame com|plement to you.</Q></P>
<P>All <HI>Spain</HI> impatiently expected to &s;ee what Remedies the new Mini&s;ters would apply to tho&s;e di&s;orders, that &s;eemed for a long time to be radicated in the Monarchy; but what|ever good intentions he had to rectifie them, he found it a difficult matter to put them in execution. The King's Trea&s;ury was exhau&s;t|ed, &s;everal private Families ruined, the price of all Commodities exce&s;&s;ive high; and the&s;e Per|plexities were heightned by the connivance of the Magi&s;trates, and the length of time. During the Mini&s;try of Don <HI>Juan</HI> nothing had been &s;et in order, and &s;ince his death one would have thought they had affected to aban|don all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>To this we may add, that the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> had never been in any employ, where he might learn that experience which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for Government. He was born
<PB N="165" REF="176">
and bred in the Genius of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which is &s;o &s;upine and carele&s;s, that nothing almo&s;t is determined there. Nay what is more, he &s;uffered the Ma&s;ter of the Council to deli|berate about the Publick Affairs, after the &s;ame manner, as he did, before his Mini&s;try, and &s;ubmitted to take his Coun&s;el; he likewi&s;e erected <HI>Junta's</HI> to debate of tho&s;e things, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to carry any great difficulty with them.</P>
<P>He erected one among&s;t the re&s;t, to which he nominated the Con&s;table, the Admiral, and the Marqu&s;s <HI>d'A&s;torgas,</HI> all which three were Councellors of State; he al&s;o admitted three Divines, whereof the King's Confe&s;&s;or was one, and three Councellors of the King's Council to examine along with him the Af|fair of the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> about which the Nuncio made &s;o great a noi&s;e. The oc|ca&s;ion of this Di&s;pute was this, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mel|lini,</HI> the Nuncio, had a mind to pre&s;ide over a Chapter of Religious, whom they call <HI>Cle|ricos Minores,</HI> who were going to choo&s;e a Pro|vincial. The Pre&s;ident de&s;ired that one of his Friends might be named; now he kew that the Nuncio had a kindne&s;s for another, &s;o he went the &s;horte&s;t way to work, and obtained a Decree of the King, which forbad him to pre&s;ide in that A&s;&s;embly, and becau&s;e he did not exactly obey it, he was fined a thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>The Nuncio &s;uffered this &s;trange treatment with indignation enough, and complained of it to the Pope. His Holine&s;s writ to the King about it, and Don <HI>Juan</HI> promi&s;ed him to get the Fine revoked; but the many di&s;|orders that happened after his death, hindred
<PB N="166" REF="177">
the execution of it. The King thought the bu&s;ine&s;s was laid a&s;leep, becau&s;e he writ a ve|ry &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Letter to the Pope about it; but for all that the Nuncio, who was not to be appea&s;ed by a Letter, renewed the Quarrel after the Prince's death. He &s;aw that the King had not as yet pitched upon a Chief Mini&s;ter, and judged that the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was not well &s;upported; he knew he had abundance of Enemies, and that among&s;t the re&s;t the Queen-Mother was the mo&s;t inveterate again&s;t him. All the&s;e con|&s;iderations &s;erved to per&s;wade him, that he &s;hould obtain an intire &s;atisfaction without any trouble.</P>
<P>He pretended therefore that he ought to lo&s;e his Place, and to go to <HI>Rome</HI> to have the Su&s;pen&s;ion taken off, which he had incurred in the year 1679. The Court ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant him what he demanded; upon this he complained very highly to the King, telling him that he ill performed what he had promi&s;ed the Pope in his Letter.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> being advanced to the Mini&s;try, was willing to examine the Rea&s;ons of the Nuncio, and tho&s;e of the Pre|&s;ident by the <HI>Junta.</HI> 'Twas alledged in fa|vour of the la&s;t, that being a native of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King could not abandon him to the Pope's re&s;entments, if at the bottom he did not de&s;erve it; that it was true indeed he had done irre|gular things upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, but then his Place was of that nature, that he could not forfeit it unle&s;s it were for Rea&s;ons of the greate&s;t importance: The Chief Mini&s;ter de|clared, that he &s;hould keep his Place of being Pre&s;ident of the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
<PB N="167" REF="178">
that Don <HI>Vincente Gonzaga</HI> &s;hould perform all his Functions. He received with extraordi|nary &s;atisfaction the offer which the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> made, to re&s;ign the Office of Ma|&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to him, which is generally po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Favourite, but would not accept of it.</P>
<P>He gave order to Don <HI>Gabriel Quinones,</HI> Se|cretary of the Council of War, to bring in his Accounts, out of hopes of drawing &s;ome Money from thence; and indeed the State was never in &s;uch extremity of want as now; for &s;ince the publi&s;hing of the King's Declara|tion for &s;inking the value of Money, all Com|merce was intirely &s;topt, the Shops continued &s;hut up, and the People groaned under the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ities imaginable. The Duke u&s;ed all his Power to remedy the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Grievances, he de&s;igned to coin new Money, and le&s;&s;en the Price of all Commodities; but the effect of his good Intentions was long de|layed, and the publick Mi&s;ery increa&s;ed more and more every day.</P>
<P>Hereupon a Man of great bu&s;ine&s;s, who&s;e name was <HI>Marcos Dias</HI> pre&s;ented a Memori|al to the Duke, wherein he propo&s;ed a Me|thod to rai&s;e the King's Revenue, and yet ea&s;e the People; he offered to prove that the Magi&s;trates of the City of <HI>Madrid,</HI> un|der pretence of reimbur&s;ing them&s;elves of the Money they had lent the late King, had rai|&s;ed con&s;iderable Summs, and had never given any account of them. He propo&s;ed a way to force them to refund the overplus, as well to &s;upply the pre&s;ent want, as to pre|vent the like Exactions for the time to come. The Duke hearkned to him, and told him
<PB N="168" REF="179">
his Advice was good. Immediately after this <HI>Marcos Dias</HI> pre&s;ented another Memorial to him, wherein he &s;hewed, that his Maje&s;ty's Dues were con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, that he offered to pay the full worth of them, and yet to make an Advance of two hundred thou&s;and Crowns, a Pre&s;ent of a hundred thou&s;and Crowns to the King, and le&s;&s;en the Impo&s;ition of the Dues one half of what it amounted to the year 1664, when they were le&s;s by one third part, than they were this pre|&s;ent Year. For this he demanded that the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City of <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Payments whereof were a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e Funds, &s;hould be reduced to five in the hun|dred, whereas they were ri&s;en to eight; and what is more, he &s;till offered to reimbur&s;e tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were not willing to &s;uffer this diminution.</P>
<P>It is natural to believe, that he knew his own Accounts well enough, not to lo&s;e any thing by his Project, and to &s;ay the truth, he had been no lo&s;er: For the Di&s;orders and Rapines were at that time &s;o great, that not a ninth part of the King's Rights came in|to his Coffers. The Duke fore&s;eeing the Event of this Affair, advi&s;ed <HI>Marcos Dias</HI> not to &s;tir out of the Palace; but he had a mind to go to <HI>Alcala,</HI> and he returned with vo|miting of Blood and Convul&s;ions, which oc|ca&s;ioned the belief that he was poi&s;oned: For this Overture of accommodating the pub|lick Affairs, di&s;gu&s;ted &s;ome particular Per&s;ons of great E&s;tates, who got prodigious Summs at the Expence of the King and People&punc; The&s;e Per&s;ons, to avert this Blow, had writ|ten to <HI>Dias,</HI> and threatned to have him in|fallibly <PB N="169" REF="180">
&s;tabbed if he continued his propo&s;als. He was very apprehen&s;ive of the danger he incurred, and be&s;ides this, the&s;e very Magi|&s;trates offered the &s;ame terms to his Maje&s;ty: But the Duke &s;aw there was all the rea&s;on in the world to prefer <HI>Dias,</HI> and &s;o he re|fu&s;ed the others. Upon a con&s;ideration of what the&s;e differences might produce, the Duke advi&s;ed him to have a care of him&s;elf, till the Treaty was concluded. The advice was good, if he had had the good fortune to have followed it, but as he came back from <HI>Alcala</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> he met &s;ome men in Ma&s;ques, who gave him &s;everal blows with little bags full of Sand, &s;o that he &s;pit abundance of blood at his mouth, and being &s;eized with a violent Feavor died on the fir&s;t day of <HI>April.</HI> The Corrigidor, and &s;ome other Officers of the City were the men that were principally exa&s;perated again&s;t him, becau&s;e he had di&s;covered their Villanies a little before: ne|verthele&s;s they were willing to &s;ubmit to &s;ome beneficial alterations in matters, and &s;o they reduced the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City, from eight to five in the hundred. There was al&s;o &s;ome &s;mall regulation made in the Civil Government, but the Duke could not forbear to be &s;en&s;ibly touched for lo&s;ing, by the death of <HI>Dias,</HI> an opportunity to &s;erve the King and ea&s;e the People.</P>
<P>In the mean time the people who had ful|ly flattered them&s;elves that if the Propo&s;als made by <HI>Dias</HI> had taken effect, they &s;hould have met with plenty in&s;tead of want; be|ing informed of his indi&s;po&s;ition, flocked about his Hou&s;e, and cryed out aloud, that he was poi|&s;oned, and that this bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be ex|amined
<PB N="170" REF="181">
to the bottom, becau&s;e he &s;uffered for the good will he had expre&s;&s;ed towards them. They added menaces again&s;t tho&s;e per&s;ons who had oppo&s;ed &s;uch profitable advice, and as the King accidentally pa&s;&s;ed by them in his Coach, a great body of them got about the Coach, and followed it crying,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Vive el Roi y muera el mal Goviorno,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Let the King live, and the ill Government dye.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There were great endeavours u&s;ed to mo|derate the fir&s;t motions of the popular fu|ry, which exceedingly increa&s;ed on the day that <HI>Dias</HI> died. Above &s;ix thou&s;and were got together, who ran up and down the Streets complaining and weeping bitterly, e|very one of them &s;aid, that they had mur|dered the only man that wi&s;hed them well. They accompanied his body to the place of burial, and the Streets were &s;o full of peo|ple, that the King dur&s;t not &s;tir out of his Palace, altho he was to go to a great Fe&s;ti|val that was celebrated by the Je&s;uits, and he had a great de&s;ire to be there. There was little probability that they would ever be appea&s;ed, but as good fortune would have it, the multitude was only made up of poor irre&s;olute people, who&s;e &s;pirits were broken by the mi&s;eries of which they complained. All this Tempe&s;t pa&s;t over in vain menaces, and &s;ome injuries again&s;t &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;ons, but however it did not alter the State of Affairs.</P>
<P>At this &s;ame time word was &s;ent to the Nuncio, by an expre&s;s Order from Court, that he &s;hould enjoy no other priviledges than what the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain</HI> did at
<PB N="171" REF="182">
<HI>Rome.</HI> This was a new occa&s;ion of di&s;con|tent to him; but the Action was general and they took care to inform the other For|reign Mini&s;ters, that for the future they would allow them only the &s;ame priviledges as their Princes allowed to the Amba&s;&s;adors of his Catholick Maje&s;ty; &s;o that he had no rea|&s;on to complain &s;ince he was treated but like the re&s;t. This re&s;olution was taken upon this account. Six <HI>Alguazils de Corte</HI> pa&s;&s;ing before the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor, it &s;eems three of his Footmen knew them, and demanded of them how they dur&s;t have the impudence to go through their Quarter. The <HI>Alguazils,</HI> returned them a &s;awcy an|&s;wer, whereupon the &s;ervants drew their Swords, but the <HI>Alguazils</HI> fired immediately upon them, and killed them upon the place. The Amba&s;&s;ador made great complaints a|bout it, they promi&s;ed to give him full &s;a|tisfaction, but to avoid the doing of it, they thought it more expedient to revoke all the Franchi&s;es.</P>
<P>The King received a Letter from the Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> and was extreamly glad to hear that he had found out a way to bor|row three hundred thou&s;and Crowns of the Merchants of <HI>Genoa</HI> for the rai&s;ing four thou|&s;and men that were to be &s;ent into the <HI>Mi|lane&s;e:</HI> But they were per&s;waded at Court that it would be a long time before they could be in a condition to get there, becau&s;e they demanded a further &s;upply of mony from <HI>Madrid,</HI> and here they wanted it, without ex|ception, for every thing. However this did not hinder them from u&s;ing all imaginable efforts to contribute towards the rai&s;ing of
<PB N="172" REF="183">
the&s;e four thou&s;and men, becau&s;e they were exceedingly alarmed at the Treaty of <HI>Ca&s;al,</HI> which they pretended our King had bought of the Duke of <HI>Mantua.</HI> They apprehended, this was an open pa&s;s to render him&s;elf Ma|&s;ter of <HI>Italy</HI> when he plea&s;ed, and they were fully per&s;waded that he had &s;ent an Army thither upon this &s;core.</P>
<P>The <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> fir&s;t whi&s;pered and &s;pread a|bout the&s;e jealou&s;ies, which at la&s;t reached the <HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;o that they drew their Soldi|ers out of their Garri&s;ons in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and be&s;towed them in their own Towns in <HI>Lum|bardy,</HI> where they made &s;ome new Fortifica|tions. The Emperor for his part was as much alarmed as the re&s;t of his Neighbours, for he &s;ent his Troops to the <HI>Milane&s;e</HI> to guard them, and &s;everal Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> put them&s;elves to a great deal of trouble, out of an apprehen&s;ion of a rupture. But if there was any rea&s;on to fear one, it was from the &s;ide of <HI>Bi&s;ca,</HI> where the people of that Pro|vince, who are under the dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> have almo&s;t every day &s;ome di&s;putes with tho&s;e that live under the dominion of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ometimes about the fi&s;hing, at other times about other differences, each of them appro|priating the River <HI>de Bida&s;&s;oa</HI> to them&s;elves, &s;o that they &s;eldom live in peace. Matters came to that up&s;hot at la&s;t, that they burnt &s;everal Barques, and took &s;everal of the <HI>French</HI> pri&s;oners. Our Amba&s;&s;ador was ordered to demand ju&s;tice for the&s;e injuries, and frequent|ly &s;poke to the Mini&s;ters about it, who con|tued deaf in the&s;e ca&s;es becau&s;e they had no mind to redre&s;s them. They per&s;i&s;ted to be &s;o &s;tiff and ob&s;tinate upon this occa&s;ion,
<PB N="173" REF="184">
that the Amba&s;&s;ador declared at la&s;t to Don <HI>Vinzente Gonzaga,</HI> that his Ma&s;ter would order his Troops to march towards the Frontiers, by which means it would be more ea&s;ie to get &s;atisfaction for the in&s;olence of the Bi&s;|cayneers, than by &s;ending to the Council at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that His Maje&s;ty was concerned for the tranquility of his Subjects, and that he would take a due cour&s;e to procure it. <HI>Gon|zaga</HI> heard Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Villars</HI> very patiently, and told him at la&s;t that he was &s;urprized to find him addre&s;s him&s;elf to him becau&s;e he was no longer Commi&s;&s;ary, and that the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Balbazez</HI> had been nominated to his Place above a month before. The Amba&s;&s;ador acquainted him, that generally the&s;e &s;orts of Changes are not made without informing tho&s;e per&s;ons who are intere&s;ted in them, and that as for him&s;elf he had never heard the lea&s;t mention of it. Don <HI>Vincente</HI> replied, that Don <HI>Pedro Colonna</HI> had been or|dered to inform him of it, but that in truth he was a negligent per&s;on, and had &s;howed him&s;elf &s;o not only on this occa&s;ion. Upon this he made &s;ome particular reflections that were not very obliging to the new Secre|tary of State.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</HI> Marque&s;s <HI>de Majorada,</HI> who had been formerly Secre|tary of State, and to whom the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valenzuela,</HI> when he became &s;ole Favou|rite had an aver&s;ion, becau&s;e he would not blindly obey him, died of grief for the lo&s;s of his Place, and to &s;ee it &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Don <HI>Jeronimo d'Eguya.</HI></P>
<P>The number of the Maids of Honour be|longing to the Queen, was about this time
<PB N="174" REF="185">
augmented. The King added to them the Daughter of the Prince&s;s <HI>Pio,</HI> tho&s;e of the Counte&s;s <HI>de Villambro&s;a,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Pouar</HI>; the Duke <HI>d'Hijar,</HI> Donna <HI>Eleonora</HI> of the Hou&s;e <HI>de Zapara,</HI> the Niece of the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Lalain,</HI> who was a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Woman. But altho' this was a Te&s;timony of the particular Con&s;ide|ration which the King had for his young Queen, becau&s;e ordinarily the Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> have not &s;o many, yet he could not forbear to be &s;en&s;ibly tormented at the Sto|ries which the <HI>Camerara</HI> continually buzzed into his Ear. Don <HI>Melchior Navarra,</HI> who had formerly been Vice-Chancellor of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and whom Don <HI>Juan</HI> bani&s;hed to <HI>Cienpuzue|los,</HI> was called home at the intreaties of the Queen Mother. Nay it was even believed that the King would give him the Place of Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> in ca&s;e the Pre&s;ident, who was then embroyled with the Nuncio, were turned of his Place.</P>
<P>The King and Queen had the plea&s;ure of hearing Ma&s;s celebrated at the Je&s;uits College in the <HI>Chaldean-Language,</HI> by a Prie&s;t of the City of <HI>Muzal,</HI> which was heretofore called <HI>Ninive.</HI> After it was over, the Queen, who was always de&s;irous of informing her &s;elf in matters of Curio&s;ity, &s;ent for him to come to her, and by the means of an Interpreter, &s;he asked him &s;everal que&s;tions, and among&s;t the re&s;t, whether the Women were as &s;everely lock'd up at <HI>Muzal,</HI> as they were at <HI>Madrid.</HI> This Que&s;tion, altho' there was nothing cri|minal in it, was &s;o maliciou&s;ly explained by the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> that the King was ob&s;erved to look upon her with a great
<PB N="175" REF="186">
deal of Coldne&s;s for &s;ome days after. This did not hinder the Queen-Mother from go|ing to vi&s;it her, who a&s;&s;ured her with all the Tenderne&s;s imaginable how &s;en&s;ibly &s;he was concerned at the&s;e ill Offices that were done her. They went together to St. <HI>Marie la Roy|alle,</HI> where was celebrated the Beatification of <HI>Torribio Alphon&s;o Mogrobejo,</HI> Second Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Lima:</HI> The Mu&s;ick of the Chappel was there; their Maje&s;ties were informed at their return, that the Great Arch-Deacon of <HI>Madrid</HI> was dead. The Queen-Mother &s;eem|ed to be de&s;irous of &s;eeing this Dignity filled by one of her own Creatures, and the Young Queen propo&s;ed to &s;end to Cardinal <HI>Porto|carero</HI> to demand it of him: But now it was too late, for the Cardinal to prevent all Solli|citations upon this Point, made ha&s;te to gratify his Nephew Don <HI>Pedro Portocarero</HI> with it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, whil&s;t the&s;e &s;mall things happened, News was brought that a Squadron of <HI>French</HI> Men of War, commanded by the Marque&s;s <HI>de Valbelle,</HI> was arrived before the I&s;le of <HI>Majorca,</HI> to demand of the Viceroy &s;ome Merchant-men that had been taken by the Cor&s;airs, &s;ince the Peace, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Valbelle</HI> had in his hands an Order of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for their Re&s;titution. The Viceroy would not re&s;tore their Prizes, alledging, <Q REND="inline">That the Per&s;ons who had taken them had already &s;hared and divided them, and that they were not all of them <HI>Majorcans</HI>; that the Effects were all con&s;umed and gone, and for his part he demanded Damages for cer|tain Ho&s;tilities which the&s;e Cor&s;airs had &s;uf|fered.</Q> <HI>Valbelle</HI> continued his In&s;tances; but &s;eeing they had no Effect, he declared that
<PB N="176" REF="187">
he would not forget, to make u&s;e of the Right of Repri&s;als; <Q REND="inline">That the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when-ever he met them on the Sea, &s;hould find it to their co&s;t; that the King his Ma&s;ter had rea&s;on to complain of the u&s;age he found at their hands; That &s;everal Governors and Viceroys dependant upon the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had taken liberty to commit all Inju&s;tices again&s;t the <HI>French</HI>; that it was almo&s;t to no purpo&s;e to demand &s;ati&s;|faction from tho&s;e at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Coun|cils were filled with Per&s;ons who had played the &s;ame Tricks, when they were in the like Po&s;ts, and con&s;equently dur&s;t not condem and puni&s;h others for the very &s;ame crimes they had committed them&s;elves; that he was a&s;|&s;ured this was the rea&s;on that occa&s;ioned this impunity and all their frivolous Pretences: In a word, that he was going to take another cour&s;e with them, and do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Menaces, one would have thought, were &s;ufficient to alarm tho&s;e Per&s;ons that were concerned in them; but they have this Maxim in <HI>Spain,</HI> That provided the danger is a little re|mote, they never fear it; whether this happens through in&s;olence or temerity, and they rather chu&s;e to &s;uffer the di&s;orders, that always fall out in Military Executions, than give them&s;elves the trouble to do Ju&s;tice upon the Complaints that are made.</P>

The Council a&s;&s;embles every <HI>Friday</HI> in the Palace, towards Evening the King comes there. The Kings, Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Fourth, and Don <HI>A|lonzo</HI> the la&s;t of that name, e&s;tabli&s;hed this Cu&s;tom. This Council is divided into four Chambers, where they di&s;tribute tho&s;e Affairs that are under their Juri&s;diction in <HI>Ca|&s;tile.</HI></P>
<P>One of them goes by the name of the Chamber of the fifteen hundred Pi&s;toles, be|cau&s;e &s;uch a Sum is to be con&s;igned before any man can get a review of a proce&s;s which is pretended to be unju&s;tly judged by the Parliaments of <HI>Vailladolid</HI> and <HI>Granada,</HI> which are the two Parliaments of <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI></P>
<P>When the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> goes out of the Council, the Coun&s;ellors follow him to his Chair; he never makes any Vi&s;its, never gives the Right hand to any at his Hou&s;e; he is to give the King an account of the mo&s;t important affairs, that pa&s;s in Council, where they name a Council every Week to report them.</P>
<P>When the King comes there, they all unco|ver them&s;elves and kneel down. Afterwards they cover them&s;elves and &s;it.</P>
<P>When Audience is over, the King retires into his Cabinet with the Pre&s;ident, who di&s;cour&s;es him about bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t moment for which the King gives his Orders, and this does not return any more to the Cham|ber for the Coun&s;ellors to deliberate up|on it.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="191">
In the Year 1609. all <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> was di|vided into five Di&s;tricts, and every Di&s;trict is under a Coun&s;ellor of the Council Royal, who takes cognizance of the conduct of the Judges, the Lords, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and other &s;ecular per&s;ons. Be&s;ides this, there is a particular Council that is called the Council of the Chamber of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI>; the Pre|&s;ident is the Chief, and the King names a certain number of Coun&s;ellors of the Coun|cil Royal whether they be three, or four that compo&s;e it. Here it is that they di&s;|patch all Benefices in the King's Nomina|tion, Titles, and Patents for the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Places, Letters of Naturalization, and the Ratification of Orders to arre&s;t the Grandees of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Graces and Fa|vours, to which his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to give his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The King receives prodigious Sums of Money for the Places that are &s;old by the means of the&s;e Coun&s;ellors. He gives likewi&s;e the Patents and Commi&s;&s;ions of &s;everal places of Ju&s;tice, and 'tis commonly pretended that in the two <HI>Ca&s;tiles,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Leon, Guypu&s;coa, Bi&s;cay,</HI> the Province <HI>de Hana,</HI> and in <HI>Navarr</HI> there are above 72 thou&s;and places of Judicature.</P>

<P>This Secretary is in a condition to &s;erve or injure people, according as he &s;tands affe|cted to them, for all the Reque&s;ts and Petitions, which they call Memorials here,

<P>This Decree is expedited by per&s;ons pro|po&s;ed for that Office; &s;o that when the&s;e Reque&s;ts are carried to the King they &s;ay the Memorial is mounted; and when they are an&s;wered, they &s;ay the Memorial falls down; or el&s;e the Con&s;ult a&s;cended and the Decree de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Without counting the Secretary of State, whom I have been &s;peaking of, there are two more that enter the Council, one of them di&s;patches the Affairs of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> the other tho&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and the <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P>One of the&s;e is named Don <HI>Manuel de Li|ra,</HI> who was formerly Ma&s;ter of the Cere|monies, and Envoy Extraordinary in <HI>Holland</HI>; he was made at his return Secretary of State. The other is called Don <HI>Pedro Colonna,</HI> he is de&s;cended of a good Family, and tho&s;e of his Hou&s;e have always po&s;&s;e&s;t great places. They may give their advice in writing in mat|ters of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The King &s;ends the Decrees to them, and through their hands Affairs go to the Council of State: They make a Report of them there, and gather the voices; and give an account of all to his Maje&s;ty, who at la&s;t orders it

as he thinks fit. They have power to a&s;|&s;emble the Council out of the appointed days, when they judge it convenient, and when the King has a mind that they &s;hould have any extraordinary Meeting, they &s;end the Order immediately to all the Coun&s;el|lors.</P>
<P>Every Secretary of State has a chief Com|mi&s;&s;ary, who is called the Official Mayor, and exerci&s;es his Ma&s;ter's Office, when he happens to be ab&s;ent. The Secretary of State for <HI>Italy</HI> has eight Commi&s;&s;ioners, reckon|ing him that is the principal, the King pays them: And the Secretary of State for the <HI>North</HI> has &s;even under him: They chu&s;e them them&s;elves, and the King gives his con|&s;ent: The&s;e di&s;patch all Patents, and ge|nerally tho&s;e Per&s;ons that get into the&s;e Em|ployments, advance their Fortunes in the World.</P>

is indeed true, that when the Coun&s;ellors of State are called thither, they have the up|per end, but then they never come but at a time when a full Council of War is held.
