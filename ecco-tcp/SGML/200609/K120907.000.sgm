and rode as if the Devil drove him, to

to meet at the Common-Hall; but before they
were all A&s;&s;embled, another Me&s;&s;enger brought
Advice, <HI>That the Champion was ju&s;t at hand</HI>; &s;o
that Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and tho&s;e with him, went to
the Town's End (clad in old fa&s;hion'd Forma|lities)
to meet him. They found him very well
guarded by a va&s;t Rabble and Mob, crying (with
loud Acclamations) <HI>Nonre&s;i&s;tance! Nonre&s;i|&s;tance!</HI>
Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (headed by one that

as followeth:</P>
<P>FIr&s;t came the Bellman and Sexton of the

Then a Herald, carrying his Coat-Armour,
being a Field Sable, charged with Three Cardi|nals
Caps, each with a Golden Band.</P>
<P>Then followed Two Old Women, one having
a Bundle of Addre&s;&s;es on her Back, and a Paper
on her Brea&s;t, with this In&s;cription, <HI>We defie all
Anti-Monarchial, Anti-Epi&s;copal, and</HI> [almo&s;t all]
<HI>Athei&s;tical and Popi&s;h Principles</HI>; the other was
covered all over with Pamphlets of divers &s;orts;

Cau&s;e,</HI> but on her Bum the Effigies of <HI>Ben. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y,</HI>

<P>Then the Serjeant of the Town, with a Mace

<P>Then came Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r, with a Book in his

<P>Then the Ald<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">men (Two by Two) having

<P>Here followed a young Dam&s;el, <HI>who had a Pro|mi&s;e
from the</HI> High-C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">h Faction, <HI>to have any
thing &s;he reque&s;ted</HI>; whereupon &s;he de&s;ired the

<P>Then 6 Men with Red Hats, having Beads in
their Hands, with this In&s;cription on their Fore|heads,
<HI>Nunc aut Nunquam.</HI></P>
<P>Then an Old Man, with a long Beard, clothed
in pure white Raiment; having the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">r's Ef|figies
[in Metzotinto] in one Hand, and in the
other, a Trinklet re&s;embling a Cru<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">fix.</P>
<P>Then followed the Old Women with Green
Branches in their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
Then a Woman, preciou&s;ly deck'd, &s;itting (<HI>as
near as I could gue&s;s</HI>) upon a Scarlet-colour'd
Bea&s;t, having abundance of Names, written in
Capital Letters, <HI>MYSTERY,</HI> &amp;c</P>
<P>Then came the High-Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ch IDOL [<HI>in

<P>After him 24 Tinkers, beating on their Ket|tles,
that the Spectators might know what La|titude
they were in.</P>
<P>Then a va&s;t Mob, hollowing, hooping and
playing the Devil.</P>
<P>In this Order he was conducted to his Inn,
where he was again Congratulated, and pre&s;ent|ed
with Wine. In fine, the Evening concluded
with Ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Drunkenne&s;s,
and all manner of Lewdne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Champion left this Town next Morning,
and &s;et out for <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ck,</HI> where he was again
met, and Congratulated by the Monkeys in
their Formalities. They entreated him to tarry
&s;ome time with them; but he declined it, and
pur&s;ued his Journey to the next Corporation;
for, you mu&s;t know, he expects the &s;ame Honours
to be paid him where-ever he goes; which (how
&s;trange &s;oever it may &s;eem to &s;ome) is no new
thing; for he's not the fir&s;t that has been waited
on by a Corporation in their Robes; for in the
Reign of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> a Fellow, who wore his Hat
button'd up on one &s;ide, and a Feather therein,
like a Tooth-drawer, with a Ro&s;e and Crown
on his Brea&s;t for a Badge, got a Licen&s;e to make
a Show of a great <HI>APE</HI> about the Country:
And coming to a certain Town, [&rindx;Whether
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<HI>Banbury,</HI> or not, I can't tell] they beat a Drum
about to give Notice, That there was a very
witty Ape to be &s;een; but the Towns-People,
being poor, thought it not worth their while
to &s;ee this &s;ight; upon which the Fellow was
enraged, and was re&s;olved to put a Trick upon
them; and thereupon &s;ends the following War|rant
to the Wor&s;hipful the Mayor.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">THe&s;e are to Require you, and every one
of you, with your Wives and Families,
(upon &s;ight hereof) to make your per&s;onal Ap|pearance
before the Queen's Ape, who is a Per|&s;on
of Rank and Quality, and of va&s;t Parts, he
having been bred at an Univer&s;ity; and is to
vi&s;it mo&s;t Parts of the Kingdom, that by his
Conver&s;ation with the Queen's Subjects, he may
be the better enabled to di&s;cover their Fidelity and
Loyalty. Hereof fail not at your Peril.</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Mayor had open'd the Warrant, he
(who always did what he pleas'd) holds it top&s;ie
turvy, and after &s;ome thoughts thereon, &s;ends
his Maid to the further end of the Town, for a
Shoemaker to come and read it. When he heard
the Contents, he &s;ummon'd his Brethren the Al|dermen
to the Town-Hall, to con&s;ult of this
weighty Affair; where they &s;at looking on one
another for &s;ome time, not knowing what to
&s;ay: At length the younge&s;t Alderman, &s;tanding
up, &s;aid, <HI>Gentlemen, If I may &s;peak without Offence,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<HI>I'll give you my Opinion in this Matter. &mdash; Speak on,</HI>
&s;ays Mr. Mayor, <HI>for though you are but a young Officer,
you may &s;peak as much Sen&s;e as any of us. &mdash; Well
then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>my humble Opinion is, That this Ape-Fellow
is a &s;awcy Knave, and only de&s;igns to make our Town
ridiculous: For was it ever known, that a Warrant &s;hould
be &s;ent, without either Name or Date, to a Mayor of a
Town, who is the Queen's Lieutenant; and that he, and his
Brethren, their Wives and Children, &s;hould be commanded
to appear before a</HI> Jackanapes? <HI>My Council is therefore,
That you take him and his Ape, and whip the whole Tribe
out of Town, which will be much to your Credit and Reputa|tion.</HI>
The Words were &s;carce &s;poke, e're a grave Al|derman
reply'd, <HI>Hold, Friend, you have &s;poke little le&s;s
than Trea&s;on; Remember 'tis the Queen's Ape. &mdash; True,
Brother,</HI> quoth the Mayor, <HI>therefore it behoves us to take
care what we &s;ay in this trouble&s;om Bu&s;ine&s;s. &mdash; Marry,</HI>
&s;ays another grave Senior, <HI>we may &s;ee by the Feather in
his Cap, and the Badge he wears, that he is the Queen's
Man; and who knows what an Injury he may do us poor
Men in the Country for contemning the Warrant? there|fore
let us e'ne go and &s;ee the Ape; 'tis but</HI> 2 d. <HI>apiece, and
no doubt but the Queen will tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it well, when &s;he hears we
have &s;hown &s;o much Reverence to her Ape.</HI> &mdash; Upon this
Speech the A&s;&s;embly re&s;olved to pay the Ape a Vi&s;it,
and ordered the Town-Clerk to acquaint the Queen's
Man therewith.</P>
<P>Next Day the Mayor and Aldermen in their Robes,
(<HI>the Serjeant carrying the Mace before them, their Recorder
being at the Head of them</HI>) with whole Droves of
Town&s;men, and their Wives, <HI>&amp;c. attended the Ape at
his Inn</HI>; where they found him &s;itting on a Table;
Mr. <HI>Mayor</HI> pre&s;ented him with Wine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> off his Hat,
and made a Leg; but Pag did not mind him. Next came
Mrs. <HI>Mayore&s;s,</HI> in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Apron, and made <HI>Pug</HI> a
fine low Courti&s;ie; upon which he put out his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,
and made a Mouth. &mdash; <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> quoth &s;he, <HI>I think in
my Con&s;cience, the Queen's Ape mocks me. &mdash; Sirrah,</HI> &s;ays
<PB N="8" REF="8">
the Mayor, <HI>I &s;ee thy &s;awcine&s;s, and I'll make thee to know
that the Woman, whom thou mocke&s;t, is my Wife, an An|cient
Woman, and a Midwife, and one who is old enough
to be thy Mother.</HI> And thereupon going to his Tutor,
<HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>do you allow your Ape to abu&s;e my Wife? &mdash; 
No,</HI> quoth he. &mdash; <HI>Truly,</HI> &s;ays the Mayor, <HI>there's &s;ufficient
witne&s;s that &s;aw him make Mops and Mows at her.</HI> &mdash; The
Tutor thereupon gave poor <HI>Pug</HI> half a Dozen &s;mart
La&s;hes with his Whip, which made his Teeth chatter;
upon which Mr. <HI>Mayor</HI> cried out, <HI>Enough, Enough:
Good Sir, you have done like a Gentleman: I de&s;ire you
never to give Correction any more in your Wrath: And when
the Play is done, be plea&s;ed to come along with your Ape to
our Town-Hall, both of you to take a &s;mall Supper with me,
and the re&s;t of my Brethren the Aldermen.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our Champion: After he had vi&s;ited
&s;everal Corporations, and given Audience to the Mob,
(who were wonderfully taken with this new Raree-Show)
he di&s;patches a Trumpeter to <HI>Cov<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ry,</HI> to
give Notice of his coming. &mdash; The Bells immediately
rung for Joy: &mdash; But that avail'd him nothing; for the
Monkeys did not appear in their Robes! which was a
great Mortification to him, and tho&s;e of his Faction.
However, he was met by 10 or 12 &s;tiff Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> on
Sorrel Nags, attended by a few Butchers and Barbers,
who made a Pur&s;e, and bought Two Hog&s;heads of Ale,
which were &s;et in the Publick Street, where the Rabble
got &s;hamefully drunk in Toa&s;ting a Health to their be|loved
IDOL.</P>
