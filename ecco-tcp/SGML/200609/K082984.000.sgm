<HEAD>A TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE BEHAVIOUR and CONDUCT OF ARCHIBALD STEWART, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> LATE Lord PROVOST of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU inform me that you had great Curio&s;ity to be acquainted with all Provo&s;t <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Story, and the Circum&s;tances of his Conduct in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> when that City was taken by the Re|bels in 1745: And that having got Copies of the In formations for and again&s;t him, you had been frightened from the Peru&s;al of them by the Sight of two &s;uch long Law Papers, which, you im|agined, mu&s;t be full of Citations and technical Terms, and ab&s;tract Rea&s;onings, of which you are wholly ignorant. But allow me to tell you, your Delicacy is very ill founded. I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing of the Information again&s;t him; and I doubt not, but, as it was drawn by a Lawyer of known Capacity, it is as good as the Subject would admit
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of. But the Information for him is really an ex|tream good Paper, and worthy of your Peru&s;al. And could you doubt of it, when you know the Importance of the Cau&s;e, the Expectations of the Publick, and above all, when you &s;aw, at the Foot, the Gentleman's Name who com|po&s;ed it?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> of <HI>Pitfour.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>You de&s;ire me to give you an Ab&s;tract of the Story, in more familiar Terms, and in a Form, which would give you le&s;s Trouble to compre|hend it. I mu&s;t own, I would not indulge your Lazine&s;s &s;o far, at the Expence of my own, were it not that I had great Obligations to Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> as well as a great per&s;onal Regard for him; and am de&s;irous of putting his Cau&s;e in a ju&s;t Light to you, who had once been &s;o far &s;educed by Ca|lumny and vulgar Reports, as to have entertained &s;ome Doubts of his Innocence.</P>
<P>Your former Prejudices are not at all &s;urprize|ing. Whatever general Contempt we may en|tertain for popular Rumours, 'tis difficult, when they come full upon us, not to lend, at fir&s;t, &s;ome Attention to them; and they fortify them|&s;elves with &s;o many Stories, and &s;uch numerous Circum&s;tances, that it becomes difficult, at la&s;t, not to give even &s;ome Credit to them. But here is Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Advantage, which he has now happily attained, after &s;uffering the greate&s;t Hard|&s;hips, and after the mo&s;t tedious Delays: He is placed before a Court of Judicature. His Ca|lumniators mu&s;t cea&s;e their furious Obloquy and loo&s;e Accu&s;ations, and harken to the more &s;ober Voice of his Pro&s;ecutors. The&s;e have reduced their Charge to Article and Propo&s;ition, which
<PB N="5" REF="4">
they are engaged to prove and defend. He has had an Opportunity to an&s;wer; and his An&s;wer is &s;o good, &s;o &s;olid, &s;o convincing, that the good|natured Mob begin to retract their Calumnies; and even the furious Zealots confe&s;s with Regret, that he has been &s;o cunning and &s;agacious, as to &s;creen him&s;elf from all legal Proof and Puni&s;hment: The utmo&s;t Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;urely, you will ever ex|pect from them.</P>
<P>As often as I heard this Subject handled in Con|ver&s;ation (and nothing el&s;e almo&s;t was talked of for &s;ome time) I de&s;ired only every zealous De|claimer to con&s;ider the Force of the Garri&s;on which the Provo&s;t commanded, and the Strength of the Place he was to defend. The&s;e are &s;urely very obvious Con&s;iderations, and yet few People ever entered into them, otherwi&s;e it were impo&s;|&s;ible for &s;uch ridiculous Calumnies to have made &s;uch &s;trong and durable Impre&s;&s;ions. Let us run over them a little, in order to &s;et the Matter in a ju&s;t Light. This may lead us into &s;ome general, as well as particular Topics, that may not be un|in&s;tructive or unentertaining.</P>
<P>The great Difference betwixt the State of this I&s;land at pre&s;ent, and what it was a few Centuries ago, is obvious to every one. At that time, the whole Defence of both Kingdoms was tru&s;ted to the People; who, tho' they received no Pay, yet never neglected the U&s;e of Arms; tho' di&s;per&s;t in their own Hou&s;es, yet lived under a regular military Subordination to their Superiors and Chieftains; and tho' obliged to labour for their Sub&s;i&s;tance, con&s;idered, all of them, their civil Occupations as a Drudgery they &s;ubmit|ted to from mere Nece&s;&s;ity, but regarded their
<PB N="6" REF="5">
military Atchievements as the only Source of Ho|nour and Glory. What Actions of de&s;perate Valour have been performed by &s;uch Troops, and what well-di&s;puted Fields they have fought, is known to every one that has the lea&s;t Ac|quaintance with the Hi&s;tory of this or of any other Nation. And the Behaviour of the pre&s;ent Highlander, who pre&s;erves but a &s;mall Part of the&s;e ancient In&s;titutions, may &s;et the Matter &s;till more &s;trongly before us.</P>
<P>The Highlanders are altogether as ignorant of Di&s;cipline as the Low-Country Ploughmen, and know as little the Nature of Encamp|ments, Marches, Ranks, Evolutions, Firing, and all the other Parts of military Exerci&s;e, which pre&s;erves Order in an Army, and renders it &s;o formidable. They advance to Battle in a confu&s;ed Heap, which &s;ome People have been plea&s;ed to call a Column: They can u&s;e no Weapon but the Broad-Sword, which gives not one Wound in ten that is mortal, and obliges each Combatant to occupy double the Ground that would &s;uffice, did he employ the Pu&s;hing-Sword or the Bayonet. And they be|come weaker by their Victories; while they di&s;per&s;e to their Homes, in order to &s;ecure the Plunder they have acquired: But &s;till, as long as they retain a devoted Obedience to their Chie&s;tain, who is their Officer, and value them|&s;elves upon military Courage above all Endow|ments, they can never ju&s;tly be regarded as a contemptible Enemy.</P>
<P>When Men have fallen into a more civi|lized Life, and have been allowed to addict them&s;elves entirely to the Cultivation of Arts
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and Manufactures, the Habit of their Mind, &s;till more than that of their Body, &s;oon ren|ders them entirely unfit for the U&s;e of Arms, and gives a different Direction to their Am|bition. Every Man is then de&s;irous to excel his Neighbour in Riches or Addre&s;s, and laugh at the Imputation of Cowardice or Effemi|nacy. But the barbarous Highlander, living chiefly by Pa&s;turage, has Lei&s;ure to cultivate the Ideas of military Honour; and hearing of nought el&s;e but the noble Exploits of his Tribe or Clan, and the renowned Heroes of his Li|neage, he &s;oon fancies that he him&s;elf is born a Hero as well as a Gentleman. The Songs recited at their Fe&s;tivals, the Fables tran&s;mit|ted from their Ance&s;tors, the continual Strain of their Conver&s;ation; all this nouri&s;hes their martial Spirit, and renders them, from their Cradle, compleat Soldiers in every thing but the Knowledge of Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>In the antient Civil Wars of <HI>Scotland,</HI> we find that the Highland Families were always of little Weight on either Side, and that the Battles were decided entirely by the <HI>Dougla&s;&s;es, Carrs, Humes,</HI> and the other Low-Country Borderers; who, pre&s;erving the &s;ame Manners and In&s;titu|tions with their Countrymen in the Mountains, had acquired a &s;uperior Addre&s;s and Bravery, by their frequent Skirmi&s;hes and Battles with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>We al&s;o find, that when all the Highlanders joined to all the Lowlanders, much more nume|rous and brave than they, invaded <HI>England,</HI> under the legal Authority of their Prince or Sovereign, that Nation were &s;o far from being alarmed at the Storm, that it &s;carce &s;ufficed to rou&s;e them from their
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Indolence and Repo&s;e. The Militia of the Nor|thern Counties was commonly &s;trong enough to repel the Invaders; and the Inhabitants of <HI>London,</HI> when Battles were fought in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> or the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham</HI> (for our Ance&s;tors &s;eldom advanced farther) heard of the&s;e Combats with as great Security, as now they read of the Wars betwixt the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and the <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Twas only when an ambitious Prince, like <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the Fir&s;t or Third, undertook the Conque&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the whole Force of <HI>England</HI> was mu&s;tered up again&s;t us.</P>
<P>But now, (how can we think of it without Shame and Indignation?) when not above a fifth Part of the&s;e mi&s;erable Highlanders (who are no braver than their Ance&s;tors) ro&s;e in Rebel|lion, they trampled down the whole Low-Coun|tries, who were generally aver&s;e to their Cau&s;e, and who&s;e Ance&s;tors could have di&s;&s;ipated twenty times the Force of &s;uch Barbarians: They ad|vanced into the middle of <HI>England,</HI> without meeting any Re&s;i&s;tance: They threw a prodigi|ous Alarm into the Capital it&s;elf, the greate&s;t City in the Univer&s;e; they &s;hook and rent the whole Fabrick of the Government, and the whole Sy&s;tem of Credit on which it was built. And tho' there were three regular Armies in <HI>England,</HI> each of them much more numerous than they, they retreated back into their own Country; and &s;till maintained their Ground. Nor can any rea&s;onable Man doubt, that if the&s;e Armies had been removed, eight Mil|lions of People mu&s;t have been &s;ubdued and reduced to Slavery by five Thou&s;and, the brave&s;t, but &s;till the mo&s;t worthle&s;s among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
I &s;hall never forget the Conver&s;ation on the&s;e Events, I had at that time with a <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Gentle|man, that could not &s;ufficiently admire how &s;o great a People, who really are Lords of the O|cean, and who boa&s;t of holding in their Hand the Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> could be &s;o im|potent and defencele&s;s again&s;t &s;o mean a Foe. <HI>Let tho&s;e Highlanders,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>have invaded my Country, and the Militia of three</HI> Swi&s;s <HI>Pari&s;hes would have repelled, what the whole Force of your three Kingdoms is &s;carce able to ma&s;ter.</HI> And if we allow only a Battalion to a Pari&s;h (which &s;eems rea&s;onable in &s;o populous a Country, and where every Man is di&s;ciplined) we &s;hall find that this Boa&s;t contains no Exaggeration, but a &s;eri|ous, and, to us, a very melancholy Truth.</P>
<P>Since then, the Di&s;po&s;ition and Di&s;cipline of this Age and Nation is &s;uch; what rea&s;onable Man could be &s;urprized to hear, that the Rebels had become Ma&s;ters of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> while it was not defended, but de&s;erted by its timid Inhabi|tants. Methinks, we &s;hould at fir&s;t have ex|pected that Event as firmly as that they would enter <HI>Kel&s;o, Penrith,</HI> or any defencele&s;s open Vil|lage that lay upon their Road. I might add <HI>Lon|don</HI> to the Number, and &s;uppo&s;e only, that the Rebels had advanced from <HI>Derby,</HI> and that Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> in&s;tead of encamping on <HI>Finchly</HI> Common, had led his Army down to <HI>Exeter</HI> or <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Would my Lord Mayor, who commands near a Million <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comprehending the City of <HI>We&s;tmini&s;ter,</HI> and Bo|rough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> which are indeed more properly his Allies than Subjects.</NOTE> of People, have ventured to give them the &s;malle&s;t Oppo&s;ition; or, like a <HI>Drawcan|&s;ir,</HI> have &s;tood alone in their way, armed with
<PB N="10" REF="9">
his Mace and great Cap of Maintenance? For I take it for granted, that every Mortal, Citizen and Courtier, Laity and Clergy, Man and Wo|man, old and young, would have de&s;erted him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to ho|nour me with the Command of either of the <HI>Highland</HI> Battalions, and that I had &s;ome hone&s;t <HI>Je&s;uitical</HI> Clergyman to lay my Scruples; I &s;hould think it a very ea&s;y Exploit to march them from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> rob the Bank of <HI>England</HI> in my Way, and carry my Spoils, with|out Interruption, thro' the whole Nation; pro|vided the Army were di&s;po&s;ed to continue mere Spectators of my Prowe&s;s.</P>
<P>To tell the Truth, one of the Per&s;ons whom I &s;hould be the mo&s;t &s;orry to meet with on my Road, would be Mr. <HI>Stewart.</HI> For by all that I can learn of his Conduct, he acted the Part of &s;o vigilant, active, and even brave a Migi|&s;trate (&s;o far as he was tried) that he might create me &s;ome Trouble: But &s;till, if his Force was no greater than what it was during the la&s;t Rebel|lion, he would not be able to give me any great Interruption.</P>
<P>Let us ennumerate that Force, in order to judge the better of it, and determine whether it was likely to re&s;i&s;t the Rebels. We &s;hall &s;urely find a Li&s;t of Heroes equal to tho&s;e of which <HI>Homer,</HI> has given us a Catalogue, if not in his <HI>Illiad,</HI> at lea&s;t in his <HI>Batrachomyomachia,</HI> or Battle of the Frogs and Mice.</P>
<P>There were of the Town Guards ninety &s;ix Men, augmented at that Time to 126. The&s;e are rather elderly Men, but pretty well di&s;|ciplined; and indeed, the only real Force the Provo&s;t was Ma&s;ter of. The re&s;t were, in a
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Word, undi&s;ciplined <HI>Britons,</HI> which implies ju&s;t as formidable an Idea as undi&s;ciplined <HI>Romans,</HI> or undi&s;ciplined <HI>Indians.</HI> They were nominally di|vided into the Trained-Bands, the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Re|giment, and the Volunteers. But this Divi&s;ion was really what the Schoolmen call a Di&s;tinction without a Difference. For with Regard to mi|litary Prowe&s;s, they were much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As to the Trained-Bands,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Trained-Bands are commonly about 1200 Men.</NOTE> in what Condi|tion that formidable Body may be in at pre&s;ent, or might have been in, at the time of the Rebel|lion, I cannot tell; but I remember, when I was a Boy, I had a very contemptible Idea of their Courage. For as they were u&s;ually drawn out on Birth Days, and marched up through the main Street, it was very common for any of them, that was bolder than u&s;ual, and would give him|&s;elf Airs before his Wife or Mi&s;tre&s;s, to fire his Piece, in the Street, without any Authority or Command from his Officers. But I always ob|&s;erved, that they &s;hut their Eyes, before they ven|tured on this military, Exploit; and I, who had at that time been accu&s;tomed to fire at Rooks and Magpyes, was very much diverted with their Timorou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">'Tis true, their Fear was better grounded than I believe they them&s;elves imagined, for their Arms are commonly &s;o bad, that a very moderate Charge of Powder would have made them bur&s;t about their Ears. The&s;e were the Arms which the Provo&s;t &s;o feloniou&s;ly allowed to fall into the Hands of the Rebels.</NOTE>. However, I que&s;tion not, but there are many very hone&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Trade&s;men among&s;t them, and as long as that is granted, I &s;uppo&s;e they will allow any one to make as merry as he plea&s;es with their mili|tary Character.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
His Maje&s;ty's Warrant to rai&s;e the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Regiment was not delivered to the Provo&s;t, till the 9th of <HI>September,</HI> &s;even Days before the Re|bels entered the Town. The olde&s;t enli&s;ted, therefore, were now Veteran Troops of &s;even Days &s;tanding: the younge&s;t not le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour. Their Number might amount to about 300. I am told, that their Appearance re&s;embled very much that of <HI>Fal|&s;taff</HI>'s Tatterdemallion Company, which his Friend &s;uppo&s;ed he had leviod by unloading the Gibbets and pre&s;&s;ing the dead Bodies. But the merry Knight defended his Company, by &s;aying, <HI>Tut, mortal Men, mortal Men, good enough to to&s;s, Food for Powder.</HI> Tho' it is my humble Opinion, that had the Mortality of the Regiment abovementioned depended on their being Food for Powder, they would have de&s;erved the Epithet of the <HI>immortal Body,</HI> as much as the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Guards, who, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> tells us, were dignified with that Appellation. But not to be too hard upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Countrymen, I &s;hall allow, that notwith&s;tanding their Pover|ty, they would have behaved as well as the Million Regiment of <HI>London,</HI> &s;o called from the Property of the Soldiers, which, it &s;eems, a|mounted to that Sum.</P>
<P>The Volunteers, who come next, to the Number of 400, and clo&s;e the Rear, the Po&s;t of Honour in all Retreats, will, perhaps, expect to be treated with greater Gravity and Re&s;pect: And no doubt they de&s;erve it, were it only for their well meant Endeavours in De|fence of their King and Country. As to their Di&s;cipline and Experience, it was much the &s;ame with that of the others. I need not add
<PB N="13" REF="12">
their Courage: For the&s;e are Points almo&s;t in&s;eparable. Religious Zeal makes a mighty Addition to Di&s;cipline; but is of no Moment when alone. <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Enthu&s;ia&s;ts conquered all the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England</HI>; and at the Battle of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;truck the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> with Admiration, even under a <HI>Tu|renne</HI> and a <HI>Cond&eacute;.</HI> But their Brethren at <HI>Bothwell-Bridge</HI> fled before they came within Sight of the Enemy. Which of the&s;e Ex|amples our Volunteers were mo&s;t likely to imitate, I leave to their own Con&s;cience to determine. A Friend of mine, who has a poe|tical Genius, has made a De&s;cription of their March from the <HI>Lawn-Market</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Port,</HI> when they went out to meet the Rebels; and has invented a very magnificent Simile to illu&s;|trate it. He compares it to the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which rolling pompou&s;ly it Waves through fertile Fields, in&s;tead of augmenting in its Cour&s;e, is continually drawn off by a thou|&s;and Canals, and, at la&s;t, becomes a &s;mall Rivu|let, which lo&s;es it&s;elf in the Sand before it reaches the Ocean.</P>
<P>Such were the Forces over whom the Pro|vo&s;t had &s;ome Authority. His Auxiliaries were two Regiments of Dragoons, under Mr. <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> then a Brigadier General, now hap|pily a Major General, in his Maje&s;ty's Service. Of what Importance the&s;e were to the De|fence of the Town, &s;hall be con&s;idered after|wards.</P>
<P>I remember <HI>Cardinal de Retz</HI> &s;ays, that a great Prince made very merry with the new levied Troops of <HI>Paris,</HI> during the Civil Wars; and when he mentioned the Defence that
<PB N="14" REF="13">
might be expected from the City again&s;t the King's Troops, u&s;ually called it, <HI>La guerre des pots de chambre,</HI> The War of the Chamber-pots. As it is well known, that a Chamber-pot is a very formidable Machine in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> I won|der it has not been comprized among&s;t Pro|vo&s;t <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Forces; at lea&s;t, among&s;t his Auxiliaries, in Conjunction with the re&s;t above|mentioned.</P>
<P>Having thus given a faithful Account of the Garri&s;on, let us now be&s;tow &s;ome Con&s;iderations on the Place, the Defence of which was expec|ted from Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> and which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t by Negligence or bad Intentions. A weak or no Garri&s;on, in a Place weakly forti|fied, or not fortified at all, mu&s;t be the Con|&s;ummation of all Weakne&s;s. We are forbid by Philo&s;ophy to &s;eek for more Cau&s;es then are re|qui&s;ite to explain any Phaenomenon. And I think it will fairly be allowed, that if the&s;e two Circum&s;tances are admitted, 'twill be quite &s;uper|fluous to have recour&s;e to a third, <HI>viz.</HI> a weak or a treacherous Governor, in order to account for the Surrender of the Place.</P>
<P>You know, that the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> is &s;ur|rounded for the greate&s;t part, by a plain Wall about twenty Foot high, where highe&s;t, and a|bout two and a half or three Foot thick, where thicke&s;t. It is not, in many Places, flanked by any Ba&s;tions: It has not Strength or Thickne&s;s enough to bear Cannon. The Be&s;ieged would not even have room to handle or charge their Pieces; but mu&s;t be &s;et up aloft as Marks to the Enemy, who can annoy them infinitely more and receive le&s;s Harm from them, than if both &s;tood in an open Field.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
You know, that this Wall, tho' near two Miles in Length, &s;urrounds not the whole Town, but is &s;upplied on the North by a Lake which is fordable in many Places.</P>
<P>You know, that this Wall, for a very con|&s;iderable Space, is overlooked by Hou&s;es, which &s;tand within five or &s;ix Paces of it, and which it was impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy becau&s;e of their Num|ber and Value.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;upplied with Water entirely by Pipes. Its Bread is even, &s;trictly &s;peaking, its daily Bread. For the Bakers never have by them more Flower than &s;erves them a Day, but bring it continually from their Milns on the Water of <HI>Leith,</HI> as Occa&s;ion requires.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as happens in all Civil Wars, there were &s;o many di&s;affected Per&s;ons in Town, that had it been held out but for three Hours (which indeed was impo&s;&s;ible) it was ju&s;tly feared, that it would have been &s;et on fire from within, in order to facilitate the Entry of the Rebels; nay, it was ea&s;ily po&s;&s;ible for the Rebels them&s;elves to &s;et fire to it from without, and force it, by that means, to a &s;peedy Surrender.</P>
<P>It is obvious to every one, however igno|rant of military Affairs, that any Governor who inclo&s;es him&s;elf in &s;uch a Place, fights with Di&s;advantage, and has infinitely better Chance for Succe&s;s, if he fairly opens his Gates, and marches forth to combat his Enemy in an equal Battle. For not to in&s;i&s;t on the other Di&s;|advantages above mentioned, the Circuit of the&s;e Walls is too large to be guarded by any mode|rate Garri&s;on; the Enemy can draw them toge|ther to any one Place by a fal&s;e Alarm, in the Night, or even in the Day; while he breaks in
<PB N="16" REF="15">
at a di&s;tant Place, that is weakly defended, and the Garri&s;on, entangled among the Hou&s;es and Garden-Walls, mu&s;t be cut in Pieces, almo&s;t without Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This Mea&s;ure therefore, of meeting the Re|bels before they reached <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> was very prudently re&s;olved on by General <HI>Gue&s;t,</HI> on the &s;ixteenth of <HI>September,</HI> when Intelligence was brought, that the Highlanders were approach|ing; and he ordered Brigadier <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> to ad|vance with his Dragoons to the <HI>Colt-Bridge</HI> for that Purpo&s;e; he al&s;o de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> to join what Infantry he could to &s;u&s;tain the Dragoons. The Provo&s;t ordered upon this Du|ty all the Town Guards, and all the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Regiment that were fit for Service. He had no Power to order the Volunteers out of Town: He only con&s;ented, that, as many as plea&s;ed, &s;hould be allowed to march out.

he had only two Regiments of Dragoons, and a very few Infantry, was &s;till a formidable Enemy to the Rebels. For, as much as regular veteran Infantry are &s;uperior to Cavalry, as much are Ca|valry, e&s;pecially in an open Field, &s;uperior to an irregular Infantry, &s;uch as the Highlanders; who cannot keep their Ranks, wherein con&s;i&s;ts all the Force of Foot; who cannot fire regularly in Platoons; who know not the U&s;e of the Bayonet, and who&s;e &s;ole Weapon is their Broad-Sword, in which a Hor&s;eman, by his very Si|tuation, has an infinite Advantage above them. Or if it were too &s;anguine to hope for a Victory from &s;uch a Force as the Brigadier commanded, a lei&s;urely and a regular Retreat might at lea&s;t have been made, tho' he had advanced within a Mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the Enemy.</P>
<P>But before the Rebels came within Sight of the King's Forces, before they came within three Miles di&s;tance of them, Orders were i&s;&s;ued to the Dragoons to wheel; which they immedi|ately did, with the greate&s;t Order and Regula|rity imaginable. As 'tis known, nothing is more beautiful than the Evolutions and Motions of Ca|valry, the Spectators &s;tood in Expectation what fine warlike <HI>Manaeuvre</HI> this might terminate in; when new Orders were immediately i&s;&s;ued to retreat. They immediately retreated, and be|gan to march in the u&s;ual Pace of Cavalry. Or|ders were repeated, every Furlong, to quicken their Pace; and both Precept and Example concurring, they quickened it &s;o well, that be|fore they reached <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> they had come to a pretty &s;mart Gallop. They pa&s;&s;ed, in an in|expre&s;&s;ible Hurry and Confu&s;ion, through the narrow Lanes at <HI>Barefoot</HI>'s Parks, in the Sight
<PB N="18" REF="17">
of all the North Part of the Town, to the in|finite Joy of the Di&s;affected, and equal Grief and Con&s;ternation of all the other Inhabitants. They ru&s;hed like a Torrent down to <HI>Leith</HI>; where they endeavoured to draw Breath: But &s;ome unlucky Boy (I &s;uppo&s;e, a <HI>Jacobite</HI> in his Heart) calling to them that the Highlanders were approaching, they immediately took to their Heels again, and galloped to <HI>Pre&s;tonpans</HI> about &s;ix Miles further. Here in a literal Sen&s;e, <HI>Timor addidit alas,</HI> their Fear added Wings; I mean to the Rebels. For otherwi&s;e, they could not po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that the&s;e formidable Enemies could be within &s;everal Miles of them. But at <HI>Pre&s;tonpans,</HI> the &s;ame Alarm was renewed, <HI>The Phili&s;tines be upon thee Samp&s;on,</HI> they gal|loped to <HI>Northberwick</HI>; and being now about twenty Miles on the other Side of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> they thought they might &s;afely di&s;mount from their Hor&s;es, and look out for Victuals. Ac|cordingly, like the antient <HI>Grecian</HI> Heroes, each of them began to kill and dre&s;s his Provi&s;ions. <HI>Egit amor dapis atque pugnae,</HI> they were actua|ted by the De&s;ire of Supper and a Battle. The Sheep and Turkies of <HI>Northberwick</HI> paid for this warlike Di&s;po&s;ition. But behold! the Un|certainty of human Happine&s;s; when the Mut|ton was ju&s;t ready to be put upon Table, they heard, or thought they heard, the &s;ame Cry of the Highlanders. Their Fear proved &s;trong|er than their Hunger; they again got on Hor&s;e|back, but were informed time enough of the Fal&s;ene&s;s of the Alarm, to prevent the &s;poiling of their Meal.</P>
<P>By &s;uch Rudiments as the&s;e, the Dragoons
<PB N="19" REF="18">
were trained; till at la&s;t they became &s;o perfect in their Le&s;&s;on, that at the Battle of <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> they could practi&s;e it of them&s;elves; tho' even there the &s;ame good Example was not wanting.</P>
<P>I have &s;een an <HI>Italian</HI> Opera called <HI>Cae&s;are in Egitto,</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI>; where in the fir&s;t Scene <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is introduced in a great Hurry, giving Orders to his Soldiers, <HI>Fugge, fugge: a'llo &s;campo.</HI> Fly, fly: to your Heels. This is a Proof, that the Commander at the <HI>Colt-Bridge</HI> is not the fir&s;t Hero that gave &s;uch Orders to his Troops.</P>
<P>'Twas in Con&s;ideration of &s;uch great Example, I &s;uppo&s;e, that he has been &s;o honourably acquit|ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon his Trial, he ju&s;tified him&s;elf at Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Expence, and threw much Blame upon the Provo&s;t.</NOTE>, and &s;ince promoted; while Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> has been impri&s;oned for fourteen Months, forced to give a Recognizance of 15000 <HI>l.</HI> for his Appearance, and three times, in a manner, brought upon his Trial. So true the old Proverb, <HI>That it is &s;afer for one Man to &s;teal a Hor&s;e, than for another to look over a Hedge.</HI></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> a&s;&s;erts, very ju&s;tly, that he neither &s;tole the Hor&s;e, nor looked over the Hedge. He neither incurred any real Guilt, nor gave the &s;malle&s;t Foundation for any &s;uch Su&s;pici|on; the only advi&s;eable Expedient for &s;aving the Town was tried; and failing, with &s;uch multipli|ed Circum&s;tances of Terror and Con&s;ternation, it left him, if po&s;&s;ible, in a wor&s;e Situation than before, by that Di&s;couragement, with which it impre&s;t every one. The Volunteers, before that time, had thought fit of them&s;elves to give up their
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Arms to the Ca&s;tle; the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Regiment had al&s;o given up their Arms: The Burghers or Trained-Bands, de&s;erted by the regular Forces, refu&s;ed to expo&s;e their Lives, when they under|&s;tood, by repeated Threatnings from the Rebels, that every Man, who made any Re&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould be put to Death. In &s;hort an univer&s;al Panic, and that not groundle&s;s, had &s;eized the People. 'Tis what the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplined Forces have been &s;ubject to, and what is, with great Difficulty cured, by the mo&s;t expert Commanders. But 'tis unavoidable in every undi&s;ciplined Multitude, and is there perfectly incurable.</P>
<P>What tho' &s;ome faint Glimp&s;e of Hope was afforded, by the Intelligence received, towards the Evening of this fatal Day, that Sir <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> with his Army had been &s;een at Sea, off <HI>Dunbar.</HI> This Succour was too di&s;tant to relieve them from an Enemy, who was at their Gates. And the Minds of Men were now unbent, and had, with great Rea&s;on, abandoned all Thoughts of De|fence, which they could not re&s;ume again, in &s;uch immediate Danger, and without any pro|bable or po&s;&s;ible View of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>In this Confu&s;ion, when nobody did his Duty, when nobody but Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> &s;eemed to think he had now any Duty to do, the Town always ungarri&s;oned, always unfortified, now in an univer&s;al Con&s;ternation, perhaps divided with|in it&s;elf, was entered without Re&s;i&s;tance by the Rebels.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it an Affront on your Un|der&s;tanding to &s;hew you more particularly how unavoidable this Event is to be e&s;teemed; and therefore having put this main Point in
<PB N="21" REF="20">
a ju&s;t Light, I &s;hall touch, tho' briefly, on the other Articles of Accu&s;ation. They are, I own, like the Provo&s;t's Forces, pretty nume|rous; but &s;urely the mo&s;t di&s;orderly, undi&s;ci|plined Rabble that ever were led into the Field. They are rather the Subject of Ridi|cule than of any &s;erious Oppo&s;ition. For In|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, &s;everal of the Judges, along with the King's Council, gave it unanimou&s;ly as their Opinion, that the levy|ing of a Regiment, without his Maje&s;ty's War|rant, was illegal: His Maje&s;ty, when applied to, confirmed that Doubt by granting that Warrant: And the plain Words of the Sta|tute requires &s;uch an Authority; yet the rai|&s;ing a Doubt upon this Head is deemed a Crime; tho' that Doubt, or any other Doubt, were it ever &s;o ill grounded, mu&s;t be allowed intirely in|nocent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article the 1&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t al&s;o is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed a Doubt about the Legality of inli&s;ting the Volunteers. And indeed, this Ca&s;e is &s;o much alike, or &s;o much the &s;ame with the other, of rai&s;ing a Regi|ment, that no wonder &s;uch a Scruple did ari&s;e. But he took Care, immediately, to con&s;ult the Lord Advocate; and he al&s;o took Care, imme|diately, to acquie&s;ce in his Lord&s;hip's Judgment. Yet this is one Article of Charge again&s;t him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Article the 2d.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Town-Council intru&s;ted the In&s;pec|tion and Care of the Work to a Committee under another Per&s;on: The Works projected were all fini&s;hed before the Arrival of the Re|bels. Are you not &s;urprized he mu&s;t an&s;wer for them, as if they were unfini&s;hed; or, as

if they had chiefly been put under his Direc|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article the 3d.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Some Zealots had propo&s;ed to &s;et up Marks of Di&s;tinction, from mere Su&s;picion on &s;everal Citizens, who behaved them&s;elves peaceably. The Provo&s;t rejected &s;o imprudent, &s;o pernicious a Mea&s;ure. Is he therefore criminal<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Article the 4th.</NOTE>? He of|fered Pay and Victuals to &s;ome Volunteers, that came from the Country; need I repeat the Que&s;tion, if this Propo&s;al renders him cri|minal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Article the 5th.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>A Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Alves,</HI> travelling on the Road towards <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> pa&s;&s;es the Rebels; and the Duke of <HI>Perth</HI> gives him a threatning Me&s;&s;age to deliver to the Provo&s;t: The Provo&s;t does not immediately commit him; both becau&s;e it did not appear, that he was any way guilty, in relating to the Chief Magi&s;trate, a Story in which he had been involuntarily engaged; and becau&s;e there was Danger of &s;preading the Story the fa&s;|ter, and intimidating the Inhabitants, by &s;uch a Commitment. Hearing a few Hours afterwards, that the Gentleman had been &s;o imprudent as to tell his Me&s;&s;age to others, he immediately com|mitted him. You are not &s;urprized, I &s;uppo&s;e, after what you have read above, to find, that this is an Article of Accu&s;ation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Article the 6th.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He is al&s;o charged with receiving a Petition from the Inhabitants, keeping a Meeting with them, and hearing a Letter read from the Preten|der's Son. The receiving the Petition was inno|cent, and al&s;o unavoidable, unle&s;s he had &s;hut him&s;elf up in his Clo&s;et. The calling a Meeting of the Inhabitants at &s;uch a Juncture, would al&s;o
<PB N="23" REF="22">
have been innocent. But he called no &s;uch Meeting. The Inhabitants, under Terror of the approaching Danger, pre&s;&s;ed in upon him wherever he went, and would have their Com|plaints and Remon&s;trances heard; and the Pro|vo&s;t, &s;o far from con&s;enting to read the Letter, openly and &s;trongly oppo&s;ed it, and left the Com|pany to avoid hearing it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article the 7th.</NOTE>. All the&s;e Facts are public and notorious.</P>
<P>On the 15th of <HI>September,</HI> the Provo&s;t was called in the Evening to Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk's, where Lord Advocate, General <HI>Gue&s;t,</HI> Briga|dier <HI>F<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> and &s;everal other Officers, were pre|&s;ent. A Propo&s;al was there made, that the Dragoons &s;hould be brought into Town, with a View to give them &s;ome Re&s;t and Refre&s;h|ment, and have their Hor&s;es fed in the Streets. But upon Reflection it appeared, that the A|venues of the Town might be taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the Rebels, and the Streets barricadoed, the Hou&s;es lined, and the Dragoons by that means fall into the Hands of the Enemy. This Pro|po&s;al, therefore, was mo&s;t ju&s;tly rejected. Next Day, after the near Approach of the Rebels, af|ter the Flight of the Dragoons, after the univer|&s;al Con&s;ternation of all Ranks, Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> refu|&s;ed to &s;ign any Order to the&s;e Dragoons, over whom he had no Authority, to return and enter into the Town; tho' he promi&s;ed them all Kind of good Reception and Entertainment, if they thought proper to come. When I find the Refu&s;al to &s;ign &s;uch an Order, &s;tated as an Article of Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Provo&s;t, I cannot think but the Accu&s;er, fore&s;eeing the
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Circum&s;tances of Merit, which the Accu&s;ed would plead, laid immediate Claim to them as his own Right; like a prudent General, who takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Eminences or &s;trong Grounds, that may be of Service to the Ene|my. This Ob&s;ervation is, indeed, applicable to almo&s;t all the Articles; there is &s;carce any of them but might be cited as a Proof of Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Vigilance, Prudence, Activity, or Moderation.</P>
<P>If the Volunteers, in the Hurry of &s;o active a Day, as the 16th of <HI>September,</HI> waited &s;ome time for Orders, without receiving any; this is al&s;o made an Article of Charge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article the 9th.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The 10th Article is of the &s;ame Force with all the re&s;t; tho' I &s;hall not tire either you or my&s;elf, by narrating or refuting it. I &s;hall only add a few Words, with regard to the <HI>Eleventh</HI> Article, which charges him with allowing the City Arms to fall into the Hands of the Rebels; becau&s;e &s;ome People think there is a Foundation for this Charge, tho' they frankly allow all the re&s;t to be frivolous, and even ridiculous,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Without mentioning the In&s;ignificancy of the&s;e Arms, Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> pleads, with regard to this Article, and with regard to all Articles, that have been, or may ever be charged again&s;t him, that, tho' Chief Magi&s;trate, and Pre&s;ident of the Town-Council, he was really but one Member, and had but one Vote. The &s;upreme Command was in the Council. They were cri|minal, if there be any Crime. It is not, nor can it be pretended, that he, in this or any other In|&s;tance, oppo&s;ed, or over-ruled, or contradicted their Determination.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> There had &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages come from the Rebels, threatning De&s;truction, if the City either re&s;i&s;ted or &s;ecreted their Arms. It is a Que&s;tion whether the Magi&s;trates, for the &s;aving of a few ru&s;ty Arms, ought in Prudence to have run the Ri&s;que of having the&s;e Threats executed, con&s;idering the known Barbarity of the Clans, and the then unknown Moderation of their Chief|tains. But it is no Que&s;tion, however the Magi|&s;trates had determined, that the People would not have con&s;ented; and con&s;equently, that the &s;ecreting the&s;e Arms was ab&s;olutely im|practicable.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> &s;howed all along a particular Attention to keep Arms out of the Hands of the Rebels. When it was propo&s;ed, after the News arrived of Sir <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>'s being &s;een off <HI>Dunbar,</HI> to de&s;ire back again from the Ca&s;tle, the Arms which the Volunteers and the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Regiment had carried thither; the Provo&s;t, apprehen&s;ive of the Con&s;equences, re|jected the Propo&s;al; till he &s;hould &s;ee, as he &s;aid, a better Di&s;po&s;ition in the Inhabitants, to make u&s;e of Arms. And he even &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to General <HI>Gue&s;t</HI> in the Ca&s;tle, informing him of the Con&s;ternation of the Town, and the little Au|thority which the Magi&s;trates had, to force the Trained-Bands to deliver up their Arms; and de|&s;iring, at the &s;ame time, the General to &s;end down a Party to carry up the Arms, or u&s;e &s;ome other Expedient to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It is proper to con&s;ider, in this Ca&s;e, the Uncertainty of the Situation to which the Magi&s;trates and Council were reduced, during the la&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Scene of this unlucky
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Affair: Sometimes terrified with the immediate Approach of the Rebels; at other times, in|couraged with &s;ome Pro&s;pect of Relief; even to|wards the End of this Period there were &s;ome Hopes of the Return of the Dragoons. Nor was that Expectation quite over in the Meeting of the Council; until they heard the Rebels had en|tered the Town. Had the Dragoons returned to the City, and animated the People in its Defence, the Charge again&s;t the Provo&s;t then, would have been inverted: Why did he &s;end up the Arms to the Ca&s;tle? Why did he carry them out of the way, when they might be in&s;tantly wanted for the Defence of the Town, and the near Ap|proach of the Rebels made a Moment's Delay of great Con&s;equence? And the Citation might have been adduced, which has been mi&s;applied in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <HI>Quod puncto &s;aepe temporis maxi|marum rerum occa&s;iones amittuntur,</HI> That Succe&s;s in the greate&s;t Affairs, frequently depends on a Moment.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Fifthly,</HI> what if Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> &s;hould &s;ay (which indeed he has here no manner of Occa|&s;ion for) that he was in the wrong, and that in the general Hurry and Con&s;ternation, it was dif|ficult not to forget &s;omething. Would any Man lay this as a criminal Accu&s;ation again&s;t him. I grant, in War, it is never allowed a General to &s;ay, <HI>Non cogitavi,</HI> I did not think of it. <HI>Marl|borough</HI> or <HI>Eugene</HI> might be a&s;hamed of &s;uch an Excu&s;e: But the Provo&s;t was bred to a different Profe&s;&s;ion. And I dare affirm, that even the&s;e great Generals, had they been ingenuous, might, twenty times in their Lives, have made u&s;e of this Apology.</P>
<P>The <HI>Twelfth,</HI> and la&s;t Article is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till
<PB N="27" REF="26">
more extraordinary than all the re&s;t. It makes the Provo&s;t the <HI>Scape</HI> Goat, and charges him with the Sins of the whole People; becau&s;e the People want Charity, and judge him criminal, therefore he mu&s;t really be &s;o. You may read, indeed, in your <HI>Machiavel,</HI> that, by a very peculiar and very ab&s;urd Law in the Republick of <HI>Florence,</HI> where|ever the popular Opinion condemned a Man, it was lawful for a certain Magi&s;trate, called the <HI>Gonfalioner&eacute;,</HI> immediately to put him to death, without any Trial or Form of Proce&s;s. I have no Intention to deny, that Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> would have fared very ill, had he been in <HI>Florence</HI> two Years ago; and had the pre&s;ent Provo&s;t been <HI>Gonfalioner&eacute;.</HI> Tho' now I believe he would have no Reluctance to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to a popular Tri|bunal.</P>
<Q><L>The People's Voice is odd,</L>
<L>It is, and it is not the Voice of God.</L></Q>
<P>But tho' popular Clamours are not here, as in <HI>Florence,</HI> authorized by Law, it is plain, that, in Practice, at lea&s;t in Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Ca&s;e, they draw very terrible Con&s;equences after them. He was &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;advantage he lay under; yet this would not di&s;courage him from attending his Duty in Parliament. He put him&s;elf into the Hands of his Enemies; for &s;uch the Mini&s;try had become; nor need we be in the lea&s;t &s;urprized at it. He &s;uffered a &s;evere Confinement for &s;ome time; and tho' this was by Degrees remitted, yet &s;till it continued a Confinement for fourteen Months, very grievous to any Man, and very prejudicial to a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have been certainly informed, that, very often
<PB N="28" REF="27">
when the Mini&s;try, in pro&s;ecution of their u&s;ual Lenity, was re&s;olved to give Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> his Li|berty, their Hands were continually &s;topped by a fre&s;h Cargo of Lies and Calumnies imported to them from <HI>Scotland</HI>; and which it required &s;ome time to examine and di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>But when, at la&s;t, he got his Liberty, and had the Pro&s;pect of a fair Trial, this happy Time, which &s;hould put a Period to all his Sufferings, was continually protracted, in the mo&s;t unaccount|able Manner in the World. At the fir&s;t Diet in <HI>March,</HI> he was put off till <HI>June,</HI> and afterwards till <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> When every Thing was then ready for a Trial, the Pro&s;ecutor de&s;erted the Diet, and Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> as well as the Public, im|agined, that all was over, and that his Enemies, con&s;cious of his Innocence, were to free him from all farther Pro&s;ecution. But he is again, it &s;eems, to be brought on his Taial with additional Ex|pence, and Vexation and Trouble. How long this may yet la&s;t is uncertain; and 'tis evident any Man might me ruined by the Continuation and Repetition of &s;uch a Practice: For which, it &s;eems, our Law provides no Remedy.</P>
<P>All the&s;e vexatious Mea&s;ures gave the more In|dignation, when we con&s;ider again it whom, and by whom, they are exerci&s;ed. You are perfectly well acquainted with Mr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> and know him to be a good Magi&s;trate, a good Friend, a good Companion, a fair Dealer: A Man in every Ac|tion of his Life, full of Humanity, Ju&s;tice and Moderation.</P>
<P>The Government too, is &s;urely the fulle&s;t of Mildne&s;s, Equity and Ju&s;tice in the World. The pre&s;ent In&s;tance is, I believe, the only one, in near &s;ixty Years, of an innocent Man,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
that has ever lain under the lea&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion. If our Government is faulty in any Thing, 'tis ra|ther in the oppo&s;ite Extreme; and the pre&s;ent Times &s;how &s;ufficient Examples of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Town of</HI> Edinburgh <HI>was lo&s;t</HI>; a mo&s;t un|expected, and mo&s;t unaccountable Event &s;urely! But what was it when the Battle of <HI>Falkirk</HI> was lo&s;t; when a numerous, a veteran and a brave Army fled before a Handful of Highlanders, whom they had &s;carce &s;een? I never heard that the Au|thor of that Calamity has been puni&s;hed, or even que&s;tioned, or has met with the &s;malle&s;t Di&s;cou|ragement; I mean, from the higher Powers. For I was very well diverted, t'other Day, by the Ac|count of a Sarca&s;m, he met with from a private Hand, which was the &s;evere&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>When the Army fled to <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> they immediately quartered them&s;elves about in all the Hou&s;es, and even in the Palace, where there dwelt, at that Time, a Lady noted for Wit and Beauty; who ob&s;erving their di&s;orderly Proceed|ings, was apprehen&s;ive they would fire the Pa|lace. She immediately went to remon&s;trate to a certain great General, and was received <HI>pro &s;o|lit&acirc; &s;u&acirc; humanitate,</HI> with his u&s;ual Humanity. Finding her Remon&s;trances vain, &s;he took her Leave in the&s;e Words, <HI>To take care,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>of the King's Hou&s;e, is your Concern: For my Part, I can run from Fire as fa&s;t as any of you.</HI></P>

<P>I Intended to have &s;ent this by <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> but not being able to meet him before he left this Country, I was obliged to keep it by me till this time, when I hear, to my great Sa|tisfaction, that Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> has been acquitted by the Jury <HI>Nemine contradicente,</HI> and that all the Facts contained in his Information, and in the foregoing Letter, were proved with an Evi|dence and Conviction, even beyond what he him&s;elf imagined. The Trial was the longe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn that ever was known in this Country; and the Judges were even obliged, by Nece&s;&s;ity, to break through an e&s;tabli&s;hed Cu&s;tom and Law, and adjourned the Court, on Account of the ab&s;olute Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uppor|ting, without Interruption, the Fatigues of &s;o long a Trial. Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> intended to have abridged their Trouble, by re&s;ting his Defence intirely on the Pur&s;uer's Evidence, without ad|ducing a &s;ingle Witne&s;s of his own: But he was over-ruled in this by his Council, who approved of the Confidence ari&s;ing from Innocence, but &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon having two Witne&s;&s;es adduced, for all the principle Facts, upon which he ground|ed his Defence.</P>
<P>Several of the Jury had been Volunteers during the Rebellion, and all of them were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by their warm Zeal for the Go|vernment. As &s;ome People had been fooli&s;h e|nough to make this Trial a Party Bu&s;ine&s;s, all
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Friends were alarmed, when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aw the Names of the Jury. For tho' they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;en&s;ible of the Probity of the&s;e Gentlemen, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they dreaded their Prejudices, and were afraid&punc; that Truth and Innocence would not obtain &s;o full a Triumph (as they did afterwards) over Pa&s;+&s;ion and Party-Zeal.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you the King's Advocate did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> want Keenne&s;s in this Affair, to give the milde&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Appellation to his Conduct. And here I mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> inform you, that what I heard of his Speech &s;ug+ge&s;ted to me a Remark, which I had often made&punc; to the Honour of our Age and Nation, in one Particular, above the antient Times of <HI>Greec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> Mr. <HI>Grant</HI> was very copious in in|&s;i&s;ting on the Su&s;picions this Country lay under with Regard to <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> the apparent Diffi|dence the Mini&s;try had &s;hewn to tru&s;t us with the Trials of the Rebels, the &s;trong Conviction e|very one in <HI>England</HI> had of Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s Guilt, and the great Scandal his Acquital would bring on the Country; to which he added, that a very &s;light Puni&s;hment was intended, a few Days Im|pri&s;onment, and a &s;mall Fine, which one &s;o rich as Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI> could ea&s;ily bear. But though you know that &s;uch extraneous and popular To|picks as the&s;e, are very u&s;ual in all the Poems and Epilogues of <HI>Cicero,</HI> and even of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>; yet I can a&s;&s;ure you this Imitation of the an|tient Orators was not at all approved of, either by the Jury or the By-&s;tanders.</P>
<P>You will be very much &s;urprized, I &s;uppo&s;e, to hear, that many of the <HI>Whigs</HI> have betrayed &s;uch a furious Zeal on this Occa&s;ion, that they are mortified, or rather indeed inraged to the la&s;t Degree, that an innocent Man has been found
<PB N="33" REF="32">
innocent: And this has given Occa&s;ion to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ppo&s;ite Party, to make his Acquital a Matter of infinite Triumph and Rejoicing; as much al|mo&s;t as the Defeat of <HI>Val,</HI> or the Surprizal of <HI>Bergen-op-zoom,</HI> or any other publick Calamity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat has ever befallen us. Whatever oppo&s;es or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;appoints the Government will always be, with|out Di&s;tinction, a great Satisfaction to them.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall further explain to you the great Difference betwixt a political and a religious <HI>Whig,</HI> in Order to account for the&s;e odd Tran|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">actions. The Idea I form of a political <HI>Whig</HI> is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hat of a Man of Sen&s;e and Moderation, a Lover of Laws and Liberty, who&s;e chief Regard to particular Princes and Families, is founded on a Regard to the publick Good: The Leaders of this Party among&s;t us, are Men of great Worth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Pre&s;ident, for in&s;tance, and Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, e&s;pecially the Former. I fay, <HI>e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Former:</HI> for tho' 'tis certain the Conduct of the Ju&s;tice Clerk was altogether commendable, as far as the Circum&s;tances and Situations, in which he was placed, would admit; yet that of the Pre&s;ident has been &s;o &s;ingularly good and great, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to be the Subject of Admiration, and even of Envy, if Virtue could ever excite that Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The religious <HI>Whigs</HI> are a very different Set of Mortals, and in my Opinion, are much wor&s;e than the religious <HI>Tories</HI>; as the political <HI>Tories</HI> are inferior to the political <HI>Whigs.</HI> I know not how it happens, but it &s;eems to me, that a Zeal for Bi&s;hops, and for the Book of Common-Prayer, tho' equally groundle&s;s, has never been able, when mixt up with Party Notions, to form &s;o virulent and exalted a Poi&s;on in human Brea&s;ts, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he oppo&s;ite Principles. Di&s;&s;imulation, Hypocri&s;y,
<PB N="34" REF="33">
Violence, Calumny, Selfi&s;hne&s;s are, generall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peaking, the true and legitimate Offspring of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Kind of Zeal.</P>
<P>This Species of <HI>Whigs,</HI> whatever they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> imagine, form but the Fag-end of the Party&punc; and are, at the Bottom, very heartily de&s;pi&s;ed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> their own Leaders. Once on a Time, indeed the Breech got over the Head; when <HI>Cromwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Ireton, Warri&s;ton,</HI> &amp;c. ruled our Councils an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Armies; and then there was fine Work indeed&punc; But ever &s;ince, though their A&s;&s;i&s;tance has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> taken at Elections, and they have been allowed&punc; in Return, to rail and make a Noi&s;e as much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> they plea&s;e, they have had but little Influence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> our publick Determinations; and long may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> continue &s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Mr. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s greate&s;t, and indeed&punc; only Enemies. The political <HI>Whigs</HI> are, man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them, his per&s;onal Friends; and all of them are extremely plea&s;ed with his Acquital, becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> they believe, what is, indeed, undeniable, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> it was founded on his Innocence. I am charitabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Joy of many of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Tories</HI> flowed from the &s;ame Motive. And as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e, if there were any &s;uch, who had a dif+ferent Motive, he will not, I believe, give the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> any Thanks for a Concern, which is more like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> to hurt than to &s;erve him.</P>
