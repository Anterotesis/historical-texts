<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE far along the moral hori|zon of France the tempe&s;t became every hour more black and turbulent, the &s;pring, earlier and more profu&s;e of graces than in the climate of England, aro&s;e in its un&s;ullied fre&s;hne&s;s, and formed a con|tra&s;t at which humanity &s;ickened. The lovely environs of Paris are not, like tho&s;e of London, &s;o encumbered with hou&s;es and buildings that you mu&s;t travel ten or twelve miles from town to find the coun|try,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
but, the moment you have pa&s;&s;ed the barriers of the city, pre&s;ent you with all the charming variety of vine-clad hills, and fields, and woods, and lawns. Imme|diately after our relea&s;e from pri&s;on we quitted our apartments in the centre of the town, and tried to &s;helter our&s;elves from ob&s;ervation in an habitation &s;itu|ated in the mo&s;t remote part of the faux|bourg Germain. From thence a few minutes walk led us to the country. But we no longer dared, as we had done the preceding year, to forget awhile the horrors of our &s;ituation by wandering occa&s;ionally amid&s;t the noble parks of St. Cloud, the wild woods of Meudon, or the elegant gardens of Bellevue, all within an hour's ride of Paris. Tho&s;e &s;eats, once the re&s;idence of fallen royalty, were now haunted by vulgar de&s;pots, by revolution|ary commi&s;&s;aries, by &s;pies of the police, and &s;ometimes by the &s;anguinary decem|virs them&s;elves. Often they held their
<PB N="3" REF="5">
fe&s;tive orgies in tho&s;e &s;cenes of beauty, where they dared to ca&s;t their polluting glance on nature, and tread with profane &s;teps her hallowed rece&s;&s;es. Even the revolutionary jury u&s;ed &s;ometimes on a decadi, the only day of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from their work of death, to go to Marly or Ver&s;ailles; and, &s;teeped as they were to the very lips in blood, without being haunted by the mangled &s;pectres of tho&s;e whom they had murdered the preceding day, they &s;aw nature in her mo&s;t benign a&s;pect, pleading the cau&s;e of humanity and mercy, and returned to fea&s;t upon the groans of tho&s;e whom they were to murder on the morrow.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e regions of decorated beauty be|ing now forbidden ground, we confined our walks to &s;ome pa&s;turage lands near the town, which were inter&s;per&s;ed with a few &s;cattered hamlets, and &s;kirted by hills, and were &s;o unfrequented, that we heard no &s;ounds except the &s;heep-bell,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and the nightingales, and &s;aw no human figure but an old pea&s;ant with a white beard, who together with a large black dog took care of the flock. It was in the&s;e walks that the &s;oul, which the &s;cenes of Paris petrified with terror, melted at the view of the &s;oothing land&s;cape, and that the eye was lifted up to heaven with tears of re&s;ignation mingled with hope. I have no words to paint the &s;trong feeling of reluctance with which I always returned from our walks to Paris, that den of carnage, that &s;laughter|hou&s;e of man. How I envied the pea|&s;ant his lonely hut! for I had now al|mo&s;t lo&s;t the idea of &s;ocial happine&s;s. My di&s;turbed imagination divided the communities of men but into two cla&s;&s;es, the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;ed; and peace &s;eemed only to exi&s;t with &s;oli|tude.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Germinal (the begin|ning of April,) the committee of public
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;afety, or rather of public extermination, cau&s;ed a law to bepa&s;&s;ed, ordering all the former nobility and &s;trangers to leave Paris within ten days, under the penalty of be|ing put out of the law; which meant, that if found in Paris after that period, they were to be led to the &s;caffold without a tri|al, as &s;oon as their per&s;ons were identified. This law, to which my family and my&s;elf were &s;ubject, was a part of the plan of general pro&s;cription that Robe&s;pierre had formed again&s;t nobles and foreigners; and which he was now impatient to put in force. We were ordered by the decree, after choo&s;ing the place of our retreat, to pre&s;ent our&s;elves at the revolutionary committee of our re&s;pective &s;ections, who delivered to each of us not a pa&s;&s;port, but what was called a pa&s;s, on which was written a declaration that we left Paris in conformity to the law of the 26th of Germinal. Thus were we condemn|ed to wander into the country with this
<PB N="6" REF="8">
pa&s;s, which was the mark of Cain upon our foreheads, and which under pain of impri&s;onment we were to depo&s;it at the municipality where we bent our cour&s;e; and we were al&s;o condemned to pre&s;ent our&s;elves every twenty-four hours before the municipality and in&s;cribe our names on a li&s;t, which was to be di&s;patched every decade to the committee of public &s;afety. And le&s;t the country municipa|lities &s;hould mi&s;take the intentions of the committee, and treat particular indi|viduals with lenity upon their produ|cing te&s;timonies of their attachment to the cau&s;e of the revolution, the&s;e devoted victims were ordered by a decree to burn every certificate of civi&s;m of which they might happen to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We cho&s;e for the place of our retreat a lit|tle village half a mile di&s;tant from Marly, and with hearts overwhelmed with an|gui&s;h bade adieu to my &s;i&s;ter, who, being married to a Frenchman, was exempted
<PB N="7" REF="9">
from the law; and we were once more driven from our home, not to return un|der the penalty of death. Our neigh|bours came weeping to our gate to take leave of us; and the poor, who were the only cla&s;s which now dared to utter a complaint, murmured loudly at the in|ju&s;tice of the decree. We were obli|ged to pa&s;s the &s;quare of the revolution, where we &s;aw the guillotine erected, the crowd a&s;&s;embled for the bloody tragedy, and the gens d'armes on hor&s;eback, fol|lowed by victims who were to be &s;acri|ficed, entering the &s;quare. Such was the daily &s;pectacle which had &s;ucceeded the painted &s;hows, the itinerant theatres, the mountebank, the dance, the &s;ong, the &s;hifting &s;cenes of harmle&s;s gaiety, which u&s;ed to attract the cheerful crowd as they pa&s;&s;ed from the Thuilleries to the Champs Eli&s;&eacute;es.</P>
<P>When we reached the barrier we were &s;topped by a concour&s;e of carriages filled
<PB N="8" REF="10">
with former nobles, and were obliged to wait till our pa&s;&s;es were examined in our turn. The proce&s;&s;ion at the gate was &s;ingular and affecting. Mo&s;t of the fu|gitives having, like our&s;elves, deferred their departure till the la&s;t day, and it being the forfeiture of our heads to be found in Paris the day following, the demand for carriages was &s;o great, and the price exacted by tho&s;e who let them out, and who knew the urgency of the ca&s;e, &s;o exorbitant, that a coach or cha|riot was a luxury which fell only to the lot of a favoured few. The greater num|ber were furni&s;hed with cabriolets, which &s;eemed from their tottering condition &s;omewhat emblematical of decayed no|bility; and many who found even the&s;e crazy vehicles too co&s;tly, journeyed in the carts which tran&s;ported their furni|ture, &s;eated upon the chairs they were conveying to their new abodes.</P>
<P>We reached our little dwelling at the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
hour of &s;un-&s;et. The hills were fringed with clouds, which &s;till reflected the fading colours of the day; the woods were in deep &s;hadow; a &s;oft veil was thrown over nature, and objects indi&s;|tinctly &s;een were decorated by imagination with tho&s;e graces which were mo&s;t con|genial to the feelings of the moment. The air was full of delicious fragrance, and the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene was only di&s;|turbed by &s;ounds the mo&s;t &s;oothing in nature, the &s;oft ru&s;tling of the leaves, or the plaintive notes of the wood-pigeon. The tears which the &s;pectacle of the guil|lotine had petrified with horror, now flowed again with melancholy luxury. Our habitation was &s;ituated within a few paces of the noble park of Marly; and the de&s;erted alleys overgrown with long gra&s;s&mdash;the encumbering fragments of rock, over which once fell the mimic ca&s;|cades, who&s;e &s;treams no longer murmur&mdash;the piles of marble which once formed the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
bed of cry&s;tal ba&s;ons&mdash;the &s;cattered ma|chinery of the jets d'eaux, who&s;e &s;ources are dried&mdash;the fallen &s;tatues&mdash;the defaced &s;ymbols of feudality&mdash;the weeds &s;pringing between the &s;tone &s;teps of the a&s;cent to the de&s;erted palace&mdash;the cobwebbed win|dows of the gay pavillions, were all in union with that pen&s;ivene&s;s of mind which our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances natu|rally excited. And here, where we could &s;ee nothing of Paris but the di&s;tant dome of the Pantheon, we &s;hould have been le&s;s unhappy, if we had not too well known that the committee of public &s;afety had not &s;ent nobles and foreigners into the country to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of rural gales, or the beauty of the opening &s;pring, but as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a ge|neral pro&s;cription; and as we pa&s;&s;ed every evening through the park of Marly, in order to appear before the municipa|lity, that appalling idea "breathed a browner horror over the woods." We
<PB N="11" REF="13">
were again re&s;cued from the general dan|ger by the two benevolent commi&s;&s;aries of the revolutionary committee of our &s;ection, who when they came to conduct us to pri&s;on had treated us with &s;o much gentlene&s;s, who had afterwards reclaimed us of the admini&s;tration of police, and who now, un&s;olicited and even una&s;ked, went to the committee of public &s;afety, declared they would an&s;wer for us with their lives, and cau&s;ed us to be put into requi&s;ition; a form which enabled us to return to Paris, and thus &s;natched us from the cla&s;s of the &s;u&s;pected and the pro|&s;cribed. To their humanity we probably owe our exi&s;tence; and I &s;hall ever recol|lect with gratitude that noble courage which led them amid&s;t the cruel impul&s;e of revolutionary government, the move|ment of which was accelerated as it went on, to pau&s;e and &s;uccour the unfortu|nate. I have the &s;atisfaction of adding, that tho&s;e commi&s;&s;aries are now at liberty
<PB N="12" REF="14">
on account of their general good con|duct, while &s;carcely any other members of revolutionary committees have e&s;caped impri&s;onment. Our benefactors have in|deed a right to this honourable ex|ception; who, although appointed the immediate agents of terror, the order of the day, regulated their actions by the eternal code of humanity.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before our departure from Paris, the guillotine, upon which &s;o many innocent victims had been &s;acrificed, for once &s;treamed with the blood of the guilty:
<Q><L>The guilty only were of life bereft:</L>
<L>Alas! the guilty only then were left!</L>
<BIBL>LUCAN'S PHARSALIA.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>One of the &s;ecrets of Robe&s;pierre's go|vernment was to employ as the &s;tep-lad|ders of his ambition men who&s;e charac|ters were marked with opprobrium, or &s;tained with crimes. Such men were be&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="15">
&s;uited to his purpo&s;e; &s;ince they were not likely to pau&s;e in the execution of his orders, depending upon his favour, perhaps, for &s;helter from legal puni&s;h|ment; and when they had fulfilled the part he allotted them, and he no longer &s;tood in need of their agency, he had &s;uf|ficient addre&s;s to lead them to make &s;ome extravagant propo&s;ition, which he deno|minated <HI>ultra-revolutionary,</HI> and for which he &s;ent them to the &s;caffold, even with the approbation of the public. Such was the &s;entiment excited by the execution of Hebert, one of the chiefs of the munici|pality of Paris, who&s;e arre&s;t by the com|mi&s;&s;ion of twelve, previou&s;ly to the thirty-fir&s;t of May, had &s;erved the con&s;pirators as the &s;ignal for ringing that fatal toc&s;in which was the knell of liberty. Hebert was the man who upon the trial of Marie Antoinette outraged all the feelings of nature, by an accu&s;ation which wrung from her bur&s;ting heart that affecting ap|peal
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to every mother who was pre&s;ent. It was he who loaded her with the indig|nity of gro&s;s abu&s;e, and poured the bit|terne&s;s of in&s;ult into the cup of death. He &s;oon after acted again at the revolu|tionary tribunal the part of evidence again&s;t the twenty-one; tho&s;e virtuous patriots, the Sidneys and the Ru&s;&s;els of their country, who&s;e martyrdom has been avenged, not as they wi&s;hed, but as they predicted, by &s;cenes of univer&s;al de&s;olation and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Hebert was commonly called Pere du Che&s;ne, on account of a daily paper he publi&s;hed, bearing that title. In this paper he profe&s;&s;ed to tread in the &s;teps of Marat, and indeed he proved him&s;elf worthy to be his lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He had the &s;ame in&s;atiable thir&s;t of blood; he demanded with the &s;ame vehemence the heads of all con&s;pirators, nobles, bank|ers, writers and merchants, the faction of federali&s;ts, and the faction of Pitt and
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Cobourg. Tho&s;e mild demands were breathed in the language of the lowe&s;t vulgar: every line was enforced by an oath, and every period rounded by an im|precation. Camille De&s;moulins, after drawing the character of this journal, concluded by &s;aying that it was written "pour faire les d&eacute;lices de Coblentz, et le &s;eul e&s;poir de Pitt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To form the delight of Coblentz, and the only hope of Pitt.</NOTE>." Such was Hebert! who having &s;ucceeded with his colleagues of the municipality in accompli&s;hing what they called the revolution of the 31&s;t of May, felt with indignation that his revolutionary genius was forced to bend before the genius of Robe&s;pierre, and determined to immortalize the month of Vento&s;e by a new revolution.</P>
<P>They had hitherto met with &s;uch &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s in in&s;urrection, that they began to think it was no very dif|ficult enterpri&s;e, now that the routine
<PB N="16" REF="18">
was known. It was but to ring the toc&s;in, beat the generale, put the city under arms, take the direction of the military force, overthrow the committee of public &s;afe|ty, and &s;eize the reins of government. The ides of March, however, proved as fatal to the dominion of the red cap, as they had heretofore done to that of the purple robe. In vain Hebert mounted the tribune at the Cordeliers, a&s;&s;erted that tyranny exi&s;ted, and cau&s;ed a black veil to be thrown over the table of the rights of man&mdash;In vain the &s;ection of Marat declared it&s;elf in in&s;urrection: the other &s;ections of Paris were of opinion, that to go from the committee of public &s;afety to the municipality was flying from Scylla to Charybdis; and though all France groaned under the tyranny of the com|mittee, there was little hope that the wounds of the bleeding country would be healed by men who were the leaders of ma&s;&s;acre, and the preachers of the agra|rian
<PB N="17" REF="19">
law. The Pari&s;ians therefore ap|plauded the decree which &s;ent Hebert and twenty of his co-adjutors in revolu|tionary crimes to that &s;anguinary tribu|nal, which, after a mockery of trial, or|dered them to execution, "and bade the cruel feel the pains they gave." There appeared &s;o much of retribution in the circum&s;tances that attended the death of Hebert and his colleagues, that it &s;eemed as if Heaven were vi&s;ibly &s;tretching forth its arm to puni&s;h the guilty. For it is re|markable enough, that they were not tried for any of the multiplied crimes they had committed, but for having a&s;|&s;erted that tyranny exi&s;ted: a &s;acred truth which every heart &s;welled to acknow|ledge, though no lips but theirs had dared to give it utterance.&mdash;The behavi|our of Hebert and his a&s;&s;ociates upon the approach of death was far different from that of the innocent &s;ufferers who had con&s;ciences void of reproach. Along
<PB N="18" REF="20">
tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous galleries where all the light which entered was "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible," terrific phantoms covered with blood &s;eemed to pur&s;ue their &s;teps, and with menacing looks prepare to drag them to aby&s;&s;es of deeper horror: they fan|cied they &s;aw the headle&s;s trunks of mur|dered victims encumbering the ground; they heard human groans and &s;hrieks &s;ounding hollow through the vaulted pa&s;&s;ages; while the knife of the guillo|tine, like Macbeth's a&euml;rial dagger, hung &s;u&s;pended before their affrighted imagi|nation. Anachar&s;is Clootz, a Pru&s;&s;ian baron and a member of the national con|vention, known by the title which he con|ferred upon him&s;elf, of orator of the hu|man race, &s;uffered death with this band of ru&s;&s;ians. He was al&s;o a preacher of blood; but, cruelty being the order of the day, what mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed him from others was not the ferocity of his prin|ciples, but the chimeras of his imagina|tion.
<PB N="19" REF="21">
His publications which were nu|merous, were always dated <HI>Paris, chef lieu du globe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paris, capital of the globe.</NOTE>;" and he &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed, that as &s;oon as all the potentates of the earth were overthrown, an event of which he had a bird's eye view from the begin|ning of the French revolution, the people of every nation &s;hould &s;end their repre|&s;entatives to Paris, who &s;hould be ho|noured with &s;eats in the national a&s;&s;em|bly of France, and there form an univer|&s;al republic, of which France &s;hould be the centre, and the other kingdoms of the world the departments. He propo&s;ed for in&s;tance, that as &s;oon as the deputies of the Engli&s;h nation arrived, England &s;hould take the name of Le departement de la Tami&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The department of the Thames.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after the memorable 10th of Au|gu&s;t, Anachar&s;is marched to the bar of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly at the head of a
<PB N="20" REF="22">
number of men he had hired to repre&s;ent the natives of every quarter of the globe, and who were clad in the re&s;pective dre&s;&s;es of the people they per&s;onated. This emba&s;&s;y of the human race de|clared, by the organ of their common orator Anachar&s;is, their admiration of the French republic, and their attachment to its cau&s;e. The conclu&s;ion of this drama however was le&s;s &s;plendid than the opening &s;cene at the bar of the con|vention; for the next morning the door of Anachar&s;is was be&s;et with Italians, Germans, Swedes, Poles, Jews, Turks, and Ru&s;&s;ians, clamorou&s;ly demanding to be paid: but none were more noi&s;y in their vociferations than a Calmuck Tartar, and an Indian of the banks of the Ohio, who menaced their orator with the ven|geance of the whole fauxbourg of St. Antoine, if he refu&s;ed to pay them for the lo&s;s of their day's labour, and the hire of their dre&s;&s;es. Anachar&s;is, after much al|tercation,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
came to a compromi&s;e with the deputation of the human race, who de|parted not very well &s;atisfied with their champion.&mdash;Clootz met death with more firmne&s;s than might have been expected from his general character, and his athe|i&s;tical principles. Hebert and his col|leagues pa&s;&s;ed their time, when together, like the fallen &s;pirits in Milton, in mu|tual accu&s;ation, till Clootz with a loud voice recited to them tho&s;e well-known lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>Je revois cette nuit, que de mal con&s;um&eacute;,</L>
<L>C&ocirc;t&eacute; &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; d'un gueux on m'avoit inhum&eacute;;</L>
<L>Et que, ble&s;&s;&eacute; pour moi d'un pareil voi&s;inage,</L>
<L>En mort de qualit&eacute; je lui tins ce langage.</L>
</LG>
<P>This citation had the effect he wi&s;hed: they became reconciled to each other; and Clootz, who&s;e only apprehen&s;ion was le&s;t any of them &s;hould die in reli|gious belief, preached athei&s;m to them till their la&s;t &s;igh.</P>
<P>The death of Hebert was the &s;ignal
<PB N="22" REF="24">
for throwing off the hideous ma&s;querade of &s;an&s;culotti&s;m, in which all the world had been arrayed during the winter, in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference to his interpreta|tion of equality. Immediately after his execution, the &s;cene &s;uddenly changed: black wigs, red caps, &s;ailors' jackets, and pantaloons were ca&s;t a&s;ide; and the eye was refre&s;hed with the &s;ight of combed locks, clean linen, and decent apparel;&mdash;while the women, who for &s;ome months had reluctantly bound up their hair beneath the round cap of the pea&s;ant, now unfolded their tre&s;&s;es, per|fumed and powdered, to the vernal gales, and decorated in whatever manner they thought proper, provided the national cockade formed one of their ornaments.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE execution of Hebert and his colleagues was &s;oon followed by that of a con&s;iderable number of the mountain deputies, among whom were Danton and Camille De&s;moulins, names not un|known to fame in the annals of the re|volution. Danton had acted a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed part on the political theatre, be|fore Robe&s;pierre had been heard of; and Camille De&s;moulins, on the day pre|ceding the taking of the Ba&s;tille, had the glory of being the fir&s;t man in France who placed the national cockade in his hat, and called upon his fellow-citizens to &s;hake off the fetters of de&s;poti&s;m. And &s;urely it was glorious to be a leader of the revolution; for, although the &s;un of liberty, like the orb of day when &s;een
<PB N="24" REF="26">
through oppo&s;ing mi&s;ts, has been turned into blood, its dawning beams were radiant, and it will again &s;hake off the foul vapours that have hung around it, and &s;pread that un&s;ullied light which exhilarates all nature.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre was not deterred from marking Danton and Camille De&s;mou|lins as his victims, by the con&s;ideration that Danton had &s;aved him at the mo|ment when Louvet's repre&s;entation of his crimes on the 2d of September had &s;o &s;trongly excited the indignation of the convention, that a decree of accu&s;a|tion was on the point of being hurled again&s;t him; and that Camille De&s;mou|lins had been his &s;chool-fellow and his friend. But the tyrant felt that Dan|ton was too "near the throne;" and Camille De&s;moulins had awakened all his fury by an appeal which he made to the people, in a paper called the "Old Cordelier," and which found an echo
<PB N="25" REF="27">
in every heart. The exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity of the revolutionary law again&s;t the &s;u&s;|pected had excited De&s;moulins' indig|nation; and in a happy parallel between the capricious tyrannies of the Roman emperors and tho&s;e of the committees of government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. I.</NOTE>, he expanded the glow|ing preci&s;ion of Tacitus into charges &s;o extremely ludicrous, that they honoured lord Shafte&s;bury's axiom, that ridicule is the te&s;t of truth. This publication made &s;ome atonement to humanity for the mi&s;|chiefs which his former writings had produced; above all, that cruel plea&s;antry upon the party of the Gironde, on which their act of accu&s;ation was founded. The atonement came too late; tyranny was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and Camille De&s;moulins pe|ri&s;hed, to u&s;e his own words, "for hav|ing &s;hed one tear over the unhappy."</P>
<P>Several other deputies &s;uffered at the

&s;ame time; and Camille De&s;moulins ob|&s;erved when he was going to the &s;caffold, "Robe&s;pierre fait des coups perc&eacute;s de la convention," alluding to the mode of cutting down the fore&s;ts in France by portions, which are marked to be hewn at certain periods. The per&s;on mo&s;t re|gretted among the deputies who now pe|ri&s;hed was Philipeaux, who having been &s;ent on a mi&s;&s;ion to the Vend&eacute;e, made known at his return the horrors of which he had been a witne&s;s, and was dragged to the &s;caffold for having dared to lift up the veil which the con&s;pirators had thrown over their crimes. Fabre d'Eglan|tine, who had been one of the founders of the revolutionary government and the auxiliary of Robe&s;pierre, peri&s;hed unla|mented. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fine talents for literature, and had written a celebrated comedy, entitled Philinthe. It was ob|&s;erved, that he had carried the &s;pirit of intrigue which prevailed in his comedy
<PB N="27" REF="29">
into the part he had acted as legi&s;lator. The love of fame, the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of authors, he felt &s;trong in death; and all his thoughts &s;eemed fixed upon a co|medy of five acts, which he had de|po&s;ited at the committee of public &s;afety, and of which he was afraid Billaud Va|rennes would take the credit. Fabre d'Eglantine was al&s;o the author of the new French calendar. Danton, while at the Conciergerie, often conver&s;ed with the pri&s;oners acro&s;s the bars of his dun|geon. He &s;eemed a&s;hamed of having been duped by Robe&s;pierre, with whom, by means of a common friend, he had an interview a few days before he was arre&s;ted, in order that they might come to an explanation. Danton, after a long conver&s;ation, finding that he was unable to move the implacable Robe&s;pierre, who li&s;tened to him with a look of in&s;ulting malignity, &s;hed &s;ome tears, and left the room, &s;aying, "Je vois que mon &s;ort

e&s;t d&eacute;cid&eacute;, mais ma mort &s;era votre ruine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I &s;ee that my fate is decided, but my death will be your ruin."</NOTE>." This prediction was fulfilled; for no &s;ooner had Robe&s;pierre rid him|&s;elf of all his rivals than he pre&s;&s;ed for|ward with a more rapid cour&s;e towards his own de&s;truction. Danton in his dungeon expatiated continually on the charms of nature, on the beauties of rural &s;cenery, and the peace of rural &s;hades. "In revolutions," cried he, "the power always remains in the hands of villains. It is better to be a poor fi&s;her|man than to govern men. Tho&s;e fools! they will cry `Long live the republic!' on &s;eeing me pa&s;s to the &s;caffold.&mdash;This day la&s;t year I cau&s;ed the revolutionary tribunal to be in&s;tituted.

Camille De&s;|moulins and Danton, who had both po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable powers of eloquence, defended them&s;elves at the tribunal with &s;o lofty a &s;pirit, and treated their judges with &s;o much di&s;dain, that at length ir|ritated by their contempt and the &s;allies of their wit, and impatient at their per|&s;everance in vindicating them&s;elves when it was determined they &s;hould die, the public accu&s;er &s;ent a letter to the con|vention, informing them that the pri&s;on|ers were in a &s;tate of revolt again&s;t the tribunal. The committee of public &s;afe|ty cau&s;ed a decree to be pa&s;&s;ed which put them out of the law, and &s;ent in|&s;tantly to execution all &s;uch of the ac|cu&s;ed as dared to in&s;ult their judges. In vain Danton called upon Barrere, upon Billaud Varennes, and upon other members of the committee of public &s;afety to ap|pear in evidence. Danton was left to his fate, and &s;ent with his colleagues to

He &s;aid to Fabre d'Eglantine, who was a poet, "Eh bien, nous de|viendrons tous poetes, nous allons tous faire des vers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An equivoque on the word <HI>vers,</HI> which in French &s;ignifies worms as well as ver&s;es.</NOTE>." On his way to the &s;caffold his head was bare, and many per&s;ons were &s;truck with its re&s;emblance to the medals of Socrates. He behaved with remarkable firmne&s;s, conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who were placed in the &s;ame cart, and &s;ometimes an&s;wering the cries of the populace by looks of &s;trong indignation.

<P>A proof of the horrible oppre&s;&s;ion under which we groaned, was, that we lament|ed the fate of Danton&mdash;of Danton, the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice on the 2d of Septem|ber, and one of the murderers of liberty on the 31&s;t of May! Yet with all the&s;e crimes upon his head, Danton &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome human affections: his mind was &s;till awake to &s;ome of the &s;en&s;ibili|ties of our nature; his temper was frank and &s;ocial, and humanity in de&s;pair leant upon him as a &s;ort of refuge from its wor&s;t oppre&s;&s;or. A week after the death of Camille De&s;moulins, his wife, a charm|ing woman of twenty-three years of age, was led to the &s;caffold. For her fate no eye except tho&s;e of her barbarous judges refu&s;ed a tear. Her execution

forms an epocha in the annals of the re|volutionary government; &s;ince on that occa&s;ion, for the fir&s;t time, a con&s;piracy &s;uppo&s;ed in a pri&s;on became the pretext for murder, and multitudes afterwards peri&s;hed the victims of that fatal inven|tion. Camille De&s;moulins was in habits of friend&s;hip with Arthur Dillon, an Iri&s;h general, who had bravely defended the pa&s;s in the fore&s;t of Argonne again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and who held the highe&s;t rank in the &s;ervice of the republic. Soon after the 31&s;t of May, he was arre&s;ted with multitudes <HI>&s;oup&ccedil;onn&eacute;s d'&ecirc;tre &s;u&s;pects</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon a <HI>&s;u&s;picion</HI> of being <HI>&s;u&s;pected.</HI></NOTE>, and was confined in the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg. His hopes of regaining his liberty re&s;ted upon the influence of his friend Camille De&s;moulins, and he was deeply affected by the intelligence of his being &s;ent to the revolutionary tribunal. In his affliction he made u&s;e of &s;ome imprudent expre&s;&s;ions to a fel|low
<PB N="33" REF="35">
pri&s;oner, and &s;eemed to flatter him|&s;elf with the hope that the people would not &s;uffer &s;uch a patriot as De&s;moulins to peri&s;h. The wretch to whom Dillon confided the&s;e &s;entiments had the atro|city to write a denunciation again&s;t him to the committee of general &s;afety, with the view of purcha&s;ing his own freedom by the life of his unfortunate compa|nion. Dillon had al&s;o, a few days before De&s;moulins peri&s;hed, written a letter to his wife, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;ympathy in her misfortunes, and his hope that the inno|cence of her hu&s;band would yet triumph. In this letter Dillon enclo&s;ed three thou&s;and livres. All the&s;e circum&s;tances were made known to the committee; and a few days after the execution of De&s;|moulins, Dillon, the turnkey to whom he had offered the letter, and Madame De&s;moulins in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of grief upon the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band whom &s;he tenderly loved, were &s;ent by an order
<PB N="34" REF="36">
of the committee to the Conciergerie to take their trial at the revolutionary tri|bunal. It appeared upon the trial that the turnkey had refu&s;ed to take the let|ter; upon which Dillon had &s;lipt it into his pocket; which the turnkey perceiv|ing, returned it to him immediately, and Dillon tore it in pieces. Madame De&s;|moulins, it was therefore clear, had never received the letter or the three thou&s;and livres enclo&s;ed. She an&s;wered the inter|rogatories of her judges with the candour of innocence, and the &s;weet complacency of her manner &s;en&s;ibly affected the &s;pec|tators. Tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in the robes of ju&s;tice condemned Dillon to die as the author of a con&s;piracy in the pri&s;ons again&s;t the &s;ecurity of the French peo|ple; the turnkey was &s;ent to death for having had &s;ufficient humanity not to make a declaration to the police of Dil|lon's propo&s;ition re&s;pecting the letter; and the unfortunate Madame De&s;mou|lins

She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in white, and with &s;ome care; and went with a placid &s;mile upon her countenance to execution, conver&s;ing with her companions in the cart, particu|larly with the wife of Hebert, who was put to death at the &s;ame time, and met her fate with equal firmne&s;s. It was one of the &s;ingular chances of the&s;e revolu|lutionary moments, that Camille De&s;|moulins, who with the pointed &s;hafts of his wit had overthrown the idol of the populace Hebert, peri&s;hed him&s;elf but a fortnight later; and that his own wife and the wife of Hebert, &s;eated on the &s;ame
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;tone in the Conciergerie, deplored their mutual lo&s;s, and were led together to the &s;caffold. The people, as Madame De&s;|moulins pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets to exe|cution, could not re&s;i&s;t uttering exclama|tions of pity and admiration. "Comme elle e&s;t belle! elle a l'air &s;i doux! quel dommage qu'elle va p&eacute;rir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"How beautiful &s;he is! how mild &s;he looks! what a pity &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h!"</NOTE>!" At the foot of the &s;caffold &s;he embraced the wife of Hebert, bade her companions in the cart farewell, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to the exe|cutioner with the &s;erenity of an angel. Dillon went to death with great com|po&s;ure, and, as he pa&s;&s;ed to execution, bowed to a friend of his and mine whom he &s;aw in the &s;treet. Far different from the meek and placid re&s;ignation with which Madame De&s;moulins made the &s;acrifice of life in all its bloom and fre&s;h|ne&s;s, was the behaviour of Chaumette procureur of the commune, and Gobet

the archbi&s;hop of Paris, who peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time. Their a&s;pect te&s;tified that Death appeared to their perturbed &s;pirits, not in the form he wears to &s;uffering innocence, to whom he comes the me&s;|&s;enger of peace, but armed with all his &s;tings, and clad in all his terrors.</P>
<P>Chaumette, one of the leaders of the con&s;piracy of the 31&s;t of May, &s;aw him|&s;elf dragged to the &s;caffold by the man whom he had powerfully contributed to rai&s;e to &s;upreme eminence, and for a mea&s;ure by which he expected to confirm his own popularity, which was over|throwing the altars of the catholic church. And Gobet, the archbi&s;hop of Paris, a weak old man, whom Chaumette and Anachar&s;is Clootz had per&s;uaded to go with the municipality to the bar of the convention, and at &s;ixty-&s;even years of age declare that the profe&s;&s;ion of his life had been impo&s;ture, that he renounced the chri&s;tian faith and his eccle&s;ia&s;tical

dignity, and demanded that the churches con&s;ecrated to religious wor&s;hip &s;hould henceforth become the temples of Rea&s;on, was puni&s;hed for his apo&s;tacy with death. Robe&s;pierre embraced the new doctrine till the church was de&s;poiled of all the trea&s;ures with which &s;uper&s;tition had en|riched it, and &s;oon after aboli&s;hed the <HI>decadary</HI> fea&s;ts of the godde&s;s Rea&s;on, and &s;ent her high prie&s;ts Gobet and Chau|mette to the guillotine. One of the few in&s;tances of fortitude in death exemplified by per&s;ons who had neither the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of innocence nor the &s;entiment of &s;ympathy to &s;ooth their minds in &s;o &s;evere a trial, was that of the former duke of Orleans, in who&s;e life nothing was worthy of applau&s;e except his manner of leaving it. The remembrance of the vote he had given again&s;t his unfortunate relation Lewis XVI. from motives of per&s;onal vengeance and ambition, could not but gnaw upon his heart, and depre&s;s

his &s;pirit, and mu&s;t have been mingled not only with a feeling of indignation again&s;t the wretches who made him &s;uffer upon fal&s;e pretences, but with all the angui&s;h of remor&s;e for having joined their party; by which act of deba&s;ement he had incurred not only guilt, but its &s;peedy puni&s;hment. Yet notwith&s;tanding &s;uch reflections could not fail to embitter his la&s;t moments, he went to execution with a calm dignity worthy of a better mind. Nor did he gratify the populace by be|traying any emotion when the cart in which he was placed &s;topped for ten minutes before the gate of the Palais-Royal, the &s;cene of a life of luxurious plea&s;ures. He looked at the building with apparent unconcern; and whatever pangs of recollection might &s;truggle at his heart, his behaviour expre&s;&s;ed no &s;en|timent but that of magnanimity till he expired.</P>
<P>The re&s;ignation and courage with

<P>Among the crowds who were led to the guillotine, two per&s;ons only di&s;played
<PB N="42" REF="44">
&s;trong marks of di&s;may and terror. One of the&s;e per&s;ons was Madame du Barry, the mi&s;tre&s;s of Lewis XV. She had been induced to leave England, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time after the revolution, and return to France, in order to &s;ecure her property; and &s;oon after the 31&s;t of May was led from her beautiful pa|vilion at Lucienne, to a pri&s;on in Paris, by one of the agents of <HI>terrori&s;m,</HI> who, I am &s;orry to add, was an Engli&s;hman. The pri&s;ons, to u&s;e a French mode of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in a &s;hort time became the anti|chambers of the &s;caffold; and Madame du Barry's mind was impre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly with a pre&s;age of her fate. Whenever the door of her chamber in the pri&s;on opened, &s;he was &s;eized with violent trem|bling, and &s;ometimes with fainting fits. At length the fatal &s;ummons to the re|volutionary tribunal arrived. The chief evidence again&s;t her was a negro &s;lave, whom &s;he had reared from an infant, and
<PB N="43" REF="45">
to whom &s;he was &s;o much attached, that he was generally to be found in her apartments; and one day Lewis XV. &s;portively created him governor of Lu|cienne, with a pen&s;ion of &s;ix hundred livres a year, which this viper, who &s;tung the bo&s;om that cheri&s;hed him, &s;till enjoys.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t flagrant te&s;timo|nies which were produced of Madame du Barry's counter-revolutionary prin|ciples was Mr. Pitt's picture, which &s;he &s;aid had been given to her the night before her departure from Lon|don by lord Thurlow. This unfortu|nate woman was condemned to die; and a per&s;on of my acquaintance who was at that time a pri&s;oner in the Con|ciergerie told me, that &s;he was deluded with the promi&s;e of pardon provided &s;he would di&s;cover the &s;pot where &s;he ac|knowledged that &s;ome trea&s;ures were concealed; but no &s;ooner were they found, than &s;he was ordered to execution. During her pa&s;&s;age thither &s;he appeared
<PB N="44" REF="46">
almo&s;t dead, and leaned her head upon the &s;houlder of the executioner. But when &s;he reached the &s;quare of the revolution, the &s;ight of the in&s;trument of death rallied her &s;inking &s;pirits, and called forth the mo&s;t cruel agonies of reluctant nature. She rent the air with her &s;hrieks, and was deaf to the expo&s;tulations of Noil, a deputy of the Gironde who peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time, and who encouraged her to re&s;ign her&s;elf to a fate which was in|evitable. Her convul&s;ed frame acquired extraordinary &s;trength: &s;he &s;truggled with her executioners, and, after a conflict at which humanity &s;hudders, was forced to undergo the fatal &s;troke, and relea&s;ed from frantic de&s;peration.</P>
<P>With Madame du Barry peri&s;hed the banker Vanderuyver, and his two &s;ons, ac|cu&s;ed of being her accomplices in &s;ending money into England, and al&s;o of having aided the knights of the poniard, as they were called, in the chateau of the Thuil|leries
<PB N="45" REF="47">
on the memorable 10th of Augu&s;t, although twenty-five witne&s;&s;es attended to prove that Vanderuyver had not quit|ted his hou&s;e during the whole of that day. But tho&s;e who fir&s;t appeared in his favour being arre&s;ted as they went out of court, the others made their e&s;cape, and left this unhappy family to their fate.</P>
<P>Their real crime was their great wealth, which it was thought expedient to &s;eize. On this account bankers were the objects of particular pro&s;cription; for although the great revolutionary &s;inancier Cambon had one day called them all together, and favoured them with an harangue of con|&s;iderable length upon the value of paper money, and the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of gold, which he a&s;&s;erted every real lover of his country ought to de&s;pi&s;e as dro&s;s, and of which he exhorted them to rid them&s;elves as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; it was feared that in &s;pite of this precious mor&s;el of elo|quence, an ob&s;tinate attachment to me|tallic
<PB N="46" REF="48">
coin &s;till lurked in the hearts of the bankers, who were for the mo&s;t part puni&s;hed for this grovelling predilection with death. Of this number was Laborde, once the banker of the court, and now guilty of a revenue of two millions of livres. This re&s;pectable old man was dragged to the &s;caffold at &s;eventy-&s;ix years of age, although &s;ince the fir&s;t epocha of the revolution he had given unque&s;|tionable proofs of his attachment to its cau&s;e, and the magnificence of his dona|tions were more than proportionate to his wealth. His fir&s;t patriotic gift was twenty thou&s;and louis; he had &s;ent all the fine hor&s;es with which his &s;tables were filled to the municipality; he had lodged troops of national guards at his hou&s;e; and above all, he had been the father of the country where his fine &s;eat of Meriville was placed. The year before his death I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome very agreeable days at that noble man&s;ion, where &s;trangers properly
<PB N="47" REF="49">
recommended were received and enter|tained with the mo&s;t &s;plendid ho&s;pitality. The plea&s;ure-grounds had been formed in a flat &s;ituation unfavourable to beauty. With immen&s;e labour and expence pa&s;|toral hills aro&s;e, and jutting rocks hung over cry&s;tal waters, or were worn into fragments by the fall of lavi&s;h ca&s;cades. A beautiful Grecian temple reared its Corinthian pillars upon a broad green a&s;|cent, and amid&s;t the deep rece&s;&s;es of &s;preading oaks a monument was erected to Captain Cook. Perhaps the decorated &s;cenes of Meriville are &s;omewhat too richly hung with ornaments; but in creat|ing this blooming Eden, which was the work of years, Mon&s;. Laborde had given employment to the whole country. For a great extent of &s;pace round his dwelling no wants were felt which his munificence was not eager to relieve; and when the eye &s;aw him, it ble&s;&s;ed him. Nor was the
<PB N="48" REF="50">
good he conferred confined to the pre|cincts of his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The Paris markets were often &s;upplied with &s;uch articles of living as were mo&s;t wanted, at the very time when its owner was lan|gui&s;hing in pri&s;on. With tears and la|mentations his tenants heard of his con|finement. Whole villages and munici|palities crowded to the bar of the con|vention, and claimed the enlargement of their common benefactor, but in vain. The rich &s;poils of his chateau were too tempting to be re&s;i&s;ted, the &s;eizure of his immen&s;e property was an expedient of finance, and as a preliminary &s;tep to its confi&s;cation he was put to death.</P>
<P>I have mentioned among the multi|tudes who peri&s;hed, that Madame du Barry and one other per&s;on only were remarked for having betrayed &s;ymp|toms of weakne&s;s and terror in their la&s;t moments. You will be &s;urpri&s;ed to

brow, to animate his failing &s;pirits, and calm the agitation of his mind by her &s;oothing attentions. After &s;eeing her hu&s;|band dragged to the &s;caffold, &s;he was thrown into pri&s;on, from which &s;he was one of the la&s;t per&s;ons relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring Madame Elizabeth was brought before the revolutionary tri|bunal. The only crime that could be imputed to her was that &s;he was the &s;i&s;ter of a king, and had &s;hewn that &s;teadfa&s;t fidelity to her brother, which in generous minds, whatever might be their political opinions, would have excited &s;entiments of e&s;teem and admiration. She had taken no part in tho&s;e fatal &s;chemes of crooked policy, which, by &s;eeking to &s;eize once more that de&s;potic power which the will of a mighty nation had torn from its gra&s;p, lo&s;t that limited empire, and that circum&s;cribed dominion of which it might &s;till have held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But whatever were the errors of Lewis XVI. or the
<PB N="51" REF="57">
vices of Marie Antoinette, no blame was by any party imputed to the prince&s;s Elizabeth. She had neither &s;hared in the intrigues or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the court. All that was known of her in pro&s;perity was her virtuous manners, and her chari|table di&s;po&s;ition; and in adver&s;ity, her un|&s;haken friend&s;hip for her brother, and her piety and re&s;ignation to God. She had &s;uf|fered not only the mo&s;t &s;evere extremes of calamity, but all tho&s;e indignities, wants, and hard&s;hips, which could give misfor|tune a keener edge; for, during the ty|ranny of Robe&s;pierre, the forms of de|cency which had till then been ob&s;erved were altogether di&s;regarded. She, who had been u&s;ed to the long train of attendants of the mo&s;t &s;plendid court of Europe, was compelled to perform the mo&s;t menial offices her&s;elf; to dre&s;s her &s;canty meal, and to &s;weep the floor of her pri&s;on. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, with no ray of hope to cheer the gloomy towers where &s;he was
<PB N="52" REF="58">
immured, except that hope which was fixed on a better &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;&s;he probably looked upon death as her mo&s;t &s;oothing refuge, and therefore met it with tranquillity and firmne&s;s. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe her examination at the revolutionary tri|bunal, not only as a proof of the calmne&s;s and dignity with which &s;he an&s;wered the interrogatories of her barbarous judges, but al&s;o as a &s;pecimen of the manner in which the trials at this &s;anguinary court were conducted even before the period ar|rived when all enquiry, all form was laid a&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>Trial of Madame ELIZABETH, as publi&s;hed at the Time by the Tribunal.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pre&s;ident to the Prince&s;s Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where were you on the 12th, 13th, 14th of July, 1789? had you any knowledge of tho&s;e con&s;piracies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was with my family. I
<PB N="53" REF="59">
had no knowledge of any of tho&s;e con|&s;piracies of which you &s;peak, and the events which then took place, I was far from either fore&s;eeing or &s;econding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the tyrant your brother fled to Varennes, did you not accompany him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every con&s;ideration led me to follow my brother; and I made it a duty then, as I &s;hould have done on any other occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not appear at the in|famous and &s;candalous orgies of the body|guard; and did you not walk round the table with Marie Antoinette, to induce each of the gue&s;ts to repeat the horrid oath which they had &s;worn to extermi|nate every patriot, in order to &s;tifle liberty in its birth, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the tottering throne?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such orgies I believe never took place; but I declare that I was in no manner whatever informed of their having
<PB N="54" REF="60">
happened, and never had any concern in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not &s;peak truth: and your denial can be of no u&s;e to you, when it is contradicted on one &s;ide by public notoriety, and on the other by the likeli|hood which there mu&s;t be in every &s;en&s;i|ble man's opinion, that a woman &s;o inti|mately connected as you were with Marie Antoinette, both by the ties of blood and tho&s;e of the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip, could not but be a &s;hater in her machinations, and favoured them to the utmo&s;t of her power. You were therefore nece&s;&s;arily in league with the wife of the tyrant; you pro|voked the abominable oath taken by the &s;atellites of the court, to exterminate and annihilate liberty in its birth; you have likewi&s;e provoked tho&s;e bloody outrages done to the precious &s;ign of liberty, the three-coloured cockade, in cau&s;ing your accomplices to tread it under foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already &s;aid that all
<PB N="55" REF="61">
the&s;e things were foreign to my character. I have no other an&s;wer to give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where were you on the 10th Augu&s;t, 1792?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was at the palace, my u&s;ual and natural re&s;idence for &s;ome time pa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you pa&s;s the night from the 9th to the 10th of Augu&s;t in your bro|ther's chamber; and did you not hold &s;ecret conferences with him, which ex|plained to you the end or motives of all the movements and preparations which were making before your eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the whole night which you mention with my brother; I never left him; he had a great deal of confidence in me; neverthele&s;s I remarked nothing, which indicated any thing of what afterwards pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your an&s;wer is both untrue and improbable; and a woman, like you, who has &s;hewn during the whole cour&s;e of the
<PB N="56" REF="62">
revolution &s;o marked an oppo&s;ition to the new order of things, cannot be be|lieved, when &s;he would wi&s;h to make us think that &s;he was ignorant of the cau&s;es of the meetings of every &s;ort which took place near the palace on the eve of the 10th of Augu&s;t.&mdash;Will you tell us what hindered you from going to bed on the night of the 9th of Augu&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not go to re&s;t, becau&s;e the con&s;tituted authorities came to inform my brother of the agitation and ferment which prevailed among the inhabitants of Paris, and of the danger which might probably re&s;ult from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in vain for you to di&s;&s;em|ble, e&s;pecially after the different confe&s;|&s;ions of Capet's wife, who a&s;&s;erted that you had attended the orgies of the body|guard, that you had &s;upported her amid&s;t her fears and apprehen&s;ions on the 10th of Augu&s;t, for the intere&s;ts and the life of Capet. But what you will not be
<PB N="57" REF="63">
able to deny is the active part which you took in the action that happened between the patriots, and the &s;atellites of tyranny. It was your zeal and your eagerne&s;s to &s;erve the enemies of the people, which made you provide them with bullets, which you took pains your&s;elf to chew, as they were to be fired again&s;t patriots, and de&s;tined to mow them down. It is the prayers which it is well known you made, that your brother's parti&s;ans &s;hould be victorious, and encouragements of every kind which you gave to the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins of the country: what do you &s;ay to all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the&s;e things which are imputed to me, are &s;o many indignities which I am far from ever having &s;ullied my&s;elf by committing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Previou&s;ly to the &s;hameful flight of the tyrant to Varennes, did you not take away the diamonds of the crown, and did you not &s;end them to Artois?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e diamonds were not
<PB N="58" REF="64">
&s;ent to d'Artois; I only placed them in the hands of a confidential per&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you inform us with whom you placed the&s;e diamonds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mon&s;. de Choi&s;eul is the per&s;on with whom I cho&s;e to make this depo&s;it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are become of the&s;e diamonds which you entru&s;ted to mon&s;. de Choi&s;eul?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am altogether ignorant what is become of them, not having had an opportunity of &s;eeing M. de Choi&s;eul. I have not concerned or troubled my&s;elf about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are impo&s;ing on us in every an&s;wer you give, and e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the diamonds; for a pro|c&egrave;s-verbal taken on the 12th of December 1792, by repre&s;entatives of the people, who knew what they were about in the affair of the diamonds, &s;tates in an unde|niable manner that the&s;e diamonds were &s;ent to d'Artois. Have you had any
<PB N="59" REF="65">
corre&s;pondence with your brother, the ci|devant Mon&s;ieur?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not recollect to have had any, e&s;pecially &s;ince &s;uch corre&s;pon|dence was prohibited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you not your&s;elf anxious in dre&s;&s;ing the wounds of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;ent to the Champs Ely&s;&eacute;es by your bro|ther again&s;t the brave Mar&s;eillois?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never knew that my brother had &s;ent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins again&s;t any one whatever. If I have ever chanced to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in dre&s;&s;ing the wounded, it was hu|manity only that could have influenced me: it was not nece&s;&s;ary for me to be informed what was the cau&s;e of their misfortunes to he&s;itate whether I &s;hould afford them relief; and if I make no merit of this, I do not imagine that you can im|pure it to me as a crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is difficult to reconcile the&s;e &s;entiments of humanity to which you pre|tend, with that barbarous joy which you
<PB N="60" REF="66">
di&s;covered, when you &s;aw &s;treams of blood flowing on the 10th of Augu&s;t. Every thing leads us to believe that you were humane only towards the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the people, and that you have all the &s;avagene&s;s of the mo&s;t blood-thir&s;ty bea&s;ts towards the defenders of liberty. So far were you from giving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the la&s;t, that you provoked the ma&s;&s;acre by your applau&s;es: &s;o far were you from di&s;arming the murderers of the people, that you lavi&s;hed on them handfulls of in&s;truments of death, by means of which you flattered your&s;elves, you and your accomplices, with the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny. Here is the hu|manity of the rulers of nations, who have at all times &s;acrificed mankind to their caprice, their ambition, or their avarice.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner Elizabeth, who&s;e defence con&s;i&s;ts in denying every charge brought again&s;t her, will &s;he be hone&s;t enough to agree that &s;he has fed little Capet with
<PB N="61" REF="67">
hopes of &s;ucceeding to his father's throne, and that by the&s;e means &s;he has provoked to royalty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have conver&s;ed familiarly with that unfortunate child, who is dear to me on more than one account; and I gave him all tho&s;e con&s;olations which appeared to me likely to reconcile him to the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who had given him birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;aying in other words, that you fed little Capet with tho&s;e pro|jects of vengeance which you and yours have never cea&s;ed forming again&s;t liberty, and that you flattered your&s;elf with build|ing up again the wrecks of a broken throne by deluging it with the blood of the patriots.&mdash;</P>

<P>Here the trial ended, no witne&s;&s;es were called, and the pri&s;oner was condemned without farther examina|tion.</P>
<P>Madame Elizabeth betrayed &s;ome emo|tion at the &s;ight of the guillotine; but &s;he
<PB N="62" REF="68">
recovered her&s;elf immediately, and waited calmly at the foot of the &s;caffold, till twenty-five per&s;ons who peri&s;hed with her were put to death, her former rank being &s;till &s;ufficiently remembered to give her a title to pre-eminence in puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Sometimes amid&s;t the&s;e horrors, the mo&s;t ludicrous violations of the laws of na|tions took place; and we might have &s;miled at the ab&s;urdities of our tyrants, if they had been mingled with le&s;s atro|city. The revolutionary committee of Cette, in the department of Herault, with a noble defiance of all ordinary forms and ob&s;ervances, thought fit to put in requi&s;ition not only &s;ome mules belong|ing to the con&s;ul of a northern court, and a cart which was his property, but the con&s;ul him&s;elf to be their driver. The requi&s;ition was &s;igned by William Tell, Brutus, Marat, Cato, and Ce&s;ar. Whether the con&s;ul was of opinion, that &s;uch great names were not to be trifled
<PB N="63" REF="69">
with, or whether he thought that driving mules was a &s;afer occupation than con|tending with tigers, is uncertain; but it is well known that he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf with pa&s;&s;ive obedience to this &s;ans-culotte edict, till the 9th of Thermidor; after which period he &s;ent to Paris to com|plain of the indignity he had &s;uffered, and demanded the cha&s;tizement of Wil|liam Tell and his colleagues.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>IT would require the pencil of a ma&s;ter to trace in all its dark colouring that picture of calamity and horror which Paris pre&s;ented at this period. A deep and &s;ilent gloom pervaded that city, where heretofore every heart bounded with gaiety, and every eye &s;parkled with delight. The citizens in general &s;aw with &s;tupefied terror tho&s;e proce&s;&s;ions of death which daily encumbered the &s;treets, and the feelings of &s;ympathy and indigna|tion were repelled by the &s;en&s;e of that per&s;onal danger from which no indivi|dual was &s;ecure. Even in his own habi|tation, and in the bo&s;om of his family, no man dared to utter a complaint but in anxious whi&s;pers, le&s;t a &s;ervant &s;hould over-hear the forbidden expo&s;tulations
<PB N="65" REF="71">
of humanity, and denounce him as a coun|ter-revolutioni&s;t. Many per&s;ons wearied of &s;pectacles of horror put an end to their exi&s;tence; and &s;ome who de&s;ired to die, but &s;hrunk from giving them&s;elves the &s;troke of death, took mea&s;ures to be &s;ent before the revolutionary tribunal, where they knew a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were ever ready. The u&s;ual means employed for this purpo&s;e was the cry of "Vive le roi!" words which many young women who had lo&s;t their parents or their lovers on the &s;caffold re|peated in the phren&s;y of de&s;pair, and found them, as they wi&s;hed, a pa&s;&s;port to the tomb. Well might the people of France have exclaimed in the words of our divine poet,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Alas poor country, almo&s;t afraid to know it&s;elf! It cannot be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once &s;een to &s;mile; where &s;ighs and groans and &s;hrieks that rend the air are made, not marked;
<PB N="66" REF="72">
where violent &s;orrow &s;eems a modern ec&s;ta&s;y: the dead man's knell is there &s;carce a&s;ked for whom: and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dy|ing or ere they &s;icken.&mdash;<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The beginning of the month of Prai|rial, a man of the name of Admiral formed the de&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Robe&s;|pierre and Collot d'Herbois: he failed in the attempt, was &s;eized, and &s;ent to the Conciegerie. A few days after Am&eacute;e Cecile Renaud, a girl of nineteen years of age, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility it appears was &s;ingularly affected by the &s;cenes which were pa&s;&s;ing before her, and who&s;e ima|gination perhaps was &s;omewhat di&s;ordered by tho&s;e terrible impre&s;&s;ions, had the courage, while an armed nation bowed before its a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to enter alone and unarmed the mon&s;ter's den, and, as it would &s;eem, with the intention, at the expence of life, to point out to her countrymen the tyrant under whom they
<PB N="67" REF="73">
groaned. Cecile Renaud went one morn|ing to Robe&s;pierre's hou&s;e, and enquired if he was at home. She was an&s;wered in the negative; and being a&s;ked what &s;he wanted, replied that &s;he came to &s;ee what &s;ort of thing was a tyrant. Upon this declaration &s;he was in&s;tantly led to the committee of general &s;afety, and went through a long examination. She again declared with the &s;ame &s;implicity, that &s;he had only gone becau&s;e &s;he want|ed to &s;ee a tyrant; and upon being &s;earched, no offen&s;ive weapon was found upon her, and all that was contained in a little bundle which &s;he held under her arm was a change of linen, with which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had provided her&s;elf, know|ing &s;he &s;hould want it in pri&s;on. The conduct of this heroic young woman furni&s;hed the tyrants with an opportunity of murder too favourable to be neglect|ed. They in&s;tantly proclaimed that a va&s;t plan of con&s;piracy again&s;t the lives
<PB N="68" REF="74">
of tho&s;e renowned patriots Collot d'Herbois and Robe&s;pierre had been formed by traitors within the pri&s;ons, and traitors without.</P>
<P>The father, mother and aunt of Ce|cile Renaud were led with her&s;elf to the Conciergerie, where &s;he was again inter|rogated, and threatened that her whole family &s;hould peri&s;h with her, if &s;he did not confe&s;s her intention of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Robe&s;pierre. She repeated what &s;he had &s;aid at the committee; and added, that they might put her to death if they thought proper, but, if &s;he de&s;erved to die, it was not for any intention to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate, but for her anti-republican &s;enti|ments. Cecile Renaud, who was very young and hand&s;ome, was dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome care, and perhaps coquetry. Her appearance led her &s;avage judges to in|vent a new &s; ecies of que&s;tion in order to bring her to confe&s;&s;ion. By their directions &s;he was &s;tripped of her own
<PB N="69" REF="75">

clothes, and covered with &s;qualid and di&s;|gu&s;ting rags, in which condition &s;he was made to appear in the council-chamber and undergo a new interrogatory, where the &s;ame menaces were repeated, and where &s;he an&s;wered as &s;he had done be|fore; and with great &s;pirit rallied her judges upon the ab&s;urdity of trying to &s;hake her purpo&s;e by a mode of puni&s;h|ment &s;o contemptible. Notwith&s;tanding no proof of any intention to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Robe&s;pierre could be brought again&s;t her, &s;he together with her whole family was put to death. Her two brothers, who were fighting the battles of the re|public on the frontiers, were ordered to be conducted to Paris, that they might &s;hare her fate; but the tyrants were too impatient for blood to wait their arrival, and owing to this circum&s;tance they e&s;caped.</P>

were brought from different parts and different pri&s;ons of Paris, who had never &s;een or heard of each other till they met at the Conciergerie, and were together dragged before the tribu|nal, and declared guilty of one common con&s;piracy. Their trial only la&s;ted a &s;uffi|cient length of time to call over their names; none of them were permitted to make any defence; the jury declared them&s;elves &s;atisfied in their &s;ouls and con|&s;ciences; and the devoted victims, covered with the red cloaks worn by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins on their way to execution, were led to death. Among tho&s;e who peri&s;hed on this occa|&s;ion were madame Sainte Amaranthe, her daughter, who had married Mon&s;ieur Sartine the &s;on of the ex-mini&s;ter, and who was now only in her nineteenth year, and one of the mo&s;t beautiful wo|men in France, and her brother, who was but &s;eventeen years of age. A friend of mine was confined in the &s;ame pri&s;on
<PB N="71" REF="81">
with this family. A &s;ervant from the out&s;ide of the walls had made madame Sainte Amaranthe under&s;tand by &s;igns that her &s;on in law, who had been con|fined in another pri&s;on, had peri&s;hed, and that &s;he her&s;elf was in danger. She went immediately to her daughter, and &s;aid to her, "Your hu&s;band is no more, and it is very probable that we &s;hall follow him to-morrow to the &s;caffold&mdash;No tears&mdash;this is no time for &s;oftne&s;s&mdash;we mu&s;t pre|pare to meet with courage a fate that is inevitable." The next day pa&s;&s;ed, and no &s;ummons to the Conciergerie arrived; but on the night following at eleven o'clock a hui&s;&s;ier entered madame Sainte Amaranthe's chamber, and told her &s;he was wanted below. The call was well under&s;tood. "And are not we too wanted?" cried her &s;on and daughter. "Certainly," an&s;wered the hui&s;&s;ier. They both flew to their mother, threw their arms round her neck, and exclaim|ed,
<PB N="72" REF="82">
"We &s;hall die together!" The next day they peri&s;hed. Fouquier Tainville, the public accu&s;er, that mon&s;ter, "hor|ribly trick'd with blood of fathers, mo|thers, daughters, &s;ons, bak'd and impa&s;ted with the parching &s;treets," placed him&s;elf at a window of the Conciergerie clo&s;e to the gate through which the pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, in order to a&s;cend the carts which were to carry them to execution. There he fea&s;ted his atrocious &s;oul with the &s;ight of &s;ixty-nine victims, covered with a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins' cloaks; and ob&s;erving among them &s;ome young women, particularly the lovely madame Sartine, walking towards the vehicles of death with that firmne&s;s which belongs to innocence; "How bold tho&s;e women look!" cried Fouquier, en|raged at their calmne&s;s; "I mu&s;t go and &s;ee if they &s;hew the &s;ame effrontery on the &s;caffold, even if I &s;hould lo&s;e my dinner!"</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre had now attained nearly
<PB N="73" REF="83">
the &s;ummit of his hopes; and his igno|rance being equal to his vanity, he did not perceive that the few &s;teps he had to climb before he could gra&s;p at ab&s;olute dominion, mu&s;t be trodden with cautious prudence; &s;ince he had advanced &s;o far, that, if he was now compelled to de&s;cend, it could only be by a de&s;cent which would lead to death. He had de&s;troyed his mo&s;t powerful rival Danton; but his &s;pies and emi&s;&s;aries, and above all his guilty con&s;cience, told him that more of his colleagues mu&s;t fall to give him per|fect &s;afety. He read in the countenances of the deputies, in the &s;ilent gloom with which his edicts were &s;anctioned, that new &s;torms gathered over his head; and he prepared, in conjunction with Cou|thon, the means of putting the lives of all tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him more ab&s;o|lutely in his power.

<P>But let us leave the martyrs of liberty, and return to the polluted fe&s;tival in&s;titu|ted by a tyrant.

<P>The citizens of Paris had been invited, and the invitation amounted to a com|mand, to decorate their hou&s;es in honour of the fe&s;tival. Accordingly Paris on that morning, lighted up by brilliant &s;un|&s;hine, pre&s;ented the mo&s;t gay and charm|ing &s;pectacle imaginable. Woods had been robbed of their &s;hade, and gar|dens to the extent of &s;ome leagues rifled of their &s;weets, in order to adorn the city. The walls of every hou&s;e were covered with luxuriant wreaths of oak and laurel, blended with flowers; civic crowns were interwoven with national ribbands; three-coloured flags waved over every portal; and the whole was arran|ged with that light and airy grace which
<PB N="89" REF="99">
belongs to Pari&s;ian fancy. The women wore garlands of fre&s;h-blown ro&s;es in their hair, and held branches of palm or laurel in their hands: the men placed oaken boughs in their hats, and children &s;trewed the way with violets and myrtle. The repre&s;entatives of the people had large three-coloured plumes in their hats, national &s;carfs thrown acro&s;s their &s;houl|ders, and no&s;egays of blended wheat|ears, fruits, and flowers in their hands, as &s;ymbols of their mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From this profu&s;ion of gay objects, which in happier moments would have excited delightful &s;en&s;ations, the droop|ing &s;oul now turned di&s;ta&s;teful. The &s;cent of carnage &s;eemed mingled with the&s;e lavi&s;h &s;weets; the glowing fe&s;toons appeared tinged with blood; and in the back ground of this fe&s;tive &s;cenery the guillotine aro&s;e before the di&s;turbed ima|gination.

<P>A great amphitheatre was rai&s;ed in the garden of the Thuilleries immediately before the palace, now the &s;eat of the convention. Upon a tribune in the centre of the theatre, Robe&s;pierre as pre&s;ident of the convention appeared; and having for a few hours di&s;encum|bered the &s;quare of the revolution of the guillotine, this high-prie&s;t of Molock, within view of that very &s;pot where his daily &s;acrifice of human victims was offer|ed up, covered with their blood, invoked the Parent of univer&s;al nature, talked of the charms of virtue, and breathed the hope of immortality. When the foul fiend had fini&s;hed this impious mockery, he de&s;cended from the tribune, and walk|ed with great &s;olemnity towards a gro|te&s;que
<PB N="91" REF="101">
kind of monument that was rai&s;|ed upon the ba&s;on in the front of the palace, which had been covered over for that purpo&s;e. On this monument was placed a mi&s;hapen and hideous figure, with a&s;s's ears, which for &s;ome hours &s;erved as an enigma to the gazing crowd, who knew not how to account for this &s;ingular appearance; till Robe&s;pierre having &s;et fire to this image of deformity, which was declared to be the &s;ymbol of athei&s;m, its cumbrous drapery &s;uddenly vani&s;hed, and a fair and maje&s;tic form was di&s;covered, emblematical of wi&s;|dom and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Athei&s;m being thus happily de&s;troyed, the convention, attended by a numerous proce&s;&s;ion of people, and preceded by triumphal cars and banners, marched to the Champ de Mars, where with much toil and co&s;t a rocky mountain had been reared, upon who&s;e lofty &s;ummit the ty|rant and his attendants climbed, and

<P>Robe&s;pierre on this day, intoxicated with his power, lo&s;t &s;ight of his u&s;ual prudence, and di&s;played all the littlene&s;s of his vanity. He cau&s;ed a line of &s;e|paration to be made between him&s;elf and the other deputies of the convention, and marched at &s;ome di&s;tance before them, like a captain at the head of his band. He had the folly to di&s;play his importance by keeping the convention and the a&s;&s;em|bled multitude waiting, and the ceremo|ny &s;u&s;pended for two hours, while he was &s;ought for in vain. During the proce&s;|&s;ion his creatures attempted to rai&s;e the cry of "Vive Robe&s;pierre!" but it was faintly re-echoed by the &s;pectators, ma|ny of whom followed him with "cur&s;es, not loud but deep, which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not."</P>

Two days after this fe&s;tival in honour of the Supreme Being, Robe&s;pierre, the &s;courge of his creatures, compelled the en&s;laved convention to pa&s;s a law, which permitted the revolutionary jury to con|demn tho&s;e who were brought before them, from their own internal conviction, without any proof whatever, or hearing any witne&s;&s;es; and which al&s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;uperfluous office of official defender, or coun&s;el; a privilege that Couthon, who made the report in the name of the com|mittee of public &s;afety, a&s;&s;erted con&s;pira|tors by no means de&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amid&s;t the definitions of ari&s;tocracy, when the law pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;u&s;pected people, Couthon in|geniou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that any good citizen was au|thori&s;ed to arre&s;t every man in the &s;treet as an ari&s;|tocrate, who held his head too much up or too much down, and al&s;o all tho&s;e who looked on one &s;ide, in&s;tead of looking you in the face.</NOTE>. In other words, the jury were now authori&s;ed to pa&s;s &s;entence without even the forms of a trial. From this period, till the fall

<P>If any of the unhappy per&s;ons thus pro&s;cribed attempted to &s;peak in their defence, they were thus &s;ilenced by the pre&s;ident: "Tu n'a pas la parole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is not your turn to &s;peak."</NOTE>;" and if they per&s;i&s;ted in declaring their innocence, they were put what was called "hors de debats;" that is, ordered im|mediately out of the court, condemned in their ab&s;ence, and &s;ent to execution. "I was not in pri&s;on when this con|&s;piracy took place," cried the vi&s;counte&s;s de Noailles, madame de la Fayette's &s;i&s;ter. "But you would have been in the con|&s;piracy if you <HI>had</HI> been there," an&s;wered

Madame de la Fayette being in another pri&s;on was, in the hurry of forming the li&s;ts of death, forgotten when her family &s;uffered&mdash;and &s;till lives. From this pe|riod the pri&s;ons became the &s;cenes of un|exampled horror and de&s;pair. Till now, the crowds by which they were inha|bited had &s;ubmitted to their fate with that cheerful re&s;ignation, and often with that carele&s;s gaiety which is buoyant at a Frenchman's heart in circum&s;tances that would altogether overwhelm the &s;inking &s;pirits of the people of other countries. The hou&s;es allotted for the pri&s;ons of the &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were for the mo&s;t part hotels of emigrants, which were placed in the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ituations of Paris, with exten&s;ive gardens, and commanding beautiful views of the country. Such habitations had nothing

<P>The ladies were attentive to the duties of the toilette, the gentlemen were polite and a&s;&s;iduous, and the court-yard of the Luxembourg, the con|vent of St. Lazare, and &s;ome other pri|&s;ons, exhibited of an evening almo&s;t as much brilliancy and gaiety as the Thuil|leries or the Champs Eli&s;&eacute;es. Mu&s;ic and literature had their amateurs. At the Luxembourg, &s;elect circles were formed to hear lectures from men of letters, &s;ometimes on chemi&s;try, &s;ometimes on a&s;tronomy. At St. Lazare, ladies &s;ent invitations to dinner from the corridor of Frimaire to the corridor of Floreal, with the &s;ame formalities as formerly from their re&s;pective hotels. Sometimes cards, &s;ometimes bout-rim&eacute;s, charades, and epigrams beguiled the evening of its

order to be led to the Conciergerie by gendarmes &s;ent for that purpo&s;e from the revolutionary tribunal. Still, how|ever, amid&s;t the tears which the pri&s;oners &s;hed over their lo&s;t companions, many of them cheri&s;hed the fond hope that they them&s;elves &s;hould e&s;cape. But the law of the 22d of Prairial tore away every illu&s;ion of the imagination or the heart, and di&s;played the general pro&s;cription of the pri&s;oners in all its extent of horror. It was no longer a &s;olitary individual who was called to death; multitudes were &s;ummoned at once. Every returning night, long covered carts drawn by four hor&s;es entered &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the court|yards of the different pri&s;ons. Whenever the trampling of the hor&s;es' feet was heard, the pri&s;oners prepared them&s;elves for their doom.

The hu&s;band was &s;carcely allowed time to bid his wife a la&s;t farewell, or the mo|ther to recommend her orphan children to the compa&s;&s;ion of &s;uch of the pri&s;oners as might &s;urvive the general calamity. At the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg, an hundred and &s;ixty-nine victims were in one night torn from their beds, and led to the grated dungeons of the Conciergerie, that pri&s;on over the gates of which might with equal propriety have been written, the &s;ame as over that of the infernal region of Dante, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Let him lo&s;e all hope who enters here."</NOTE>La&s;ciate &s;peranza voi ch'en|trate;" for here it might literally be &s;aid, "hope never came, that comes to all." I have &s;een the Conciergerie, that abode of horror, that anti-chamber of the tomb. I have &s;een tho&s;e infectious cells, where the pri&s;oners breathed contagion, where the walls are in &s;ome places &s;tained with the blood of the ma&s;&s;acres of September, and where a part of the &s;pacious court|yard,
<PB N="100" REF="110">
round which the grated dungeons are built, remains unpaved &s;ince that pe|riod, when the &s;tones were taken up for the purpo&s;e of burying the dead. I have &s;een the chamber, where the per&s;ons condemned by the revolutionary tribunal &s;ubmitted to the preparatory offices of the executioner; where his &s;ci&s;&s;ars cut off the lavi&s;h tre&s;&s;es of the youthful beauty, and where he tied her tender hands behind her wai&s;t with cords. Merciful Heaven! and among tho&s;e who have thus &s;uffered were per&s;ons to whom my heart was bound by the ties of friend&s;hip and af|fection.&mdash;But though I have &s;urvived &s;uch &s;cenes, they have left upon my heart that &s;ettled melancholy which never can be di&s;&s;ipated.&mdash;For me, the world has lo&s;t its illu&s;ive colouring; its fairy &s;pells, its light enchantments have vani&s;hed; and death, the idea mo&s;t familiar to my ima|gination, appears to my wearied &s;pirit the only point of re&s;t.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual pretext for tho&s;e murders
<PB N="101" REF="111">
<HI>in ma&s;s,</HI> which were practi&s;ed at this pe|riod, was that of a con&s;piracy in the pri|&s;ons; a vague and wide term which the tyrants might interpret at their plea&s;ure, and which gave them the power of in|cluding whatever per&s;ons and whatever numbers they thought proper. Spies were placed in every pri&s;on, who, after making out their li&s;ts of pro&s;cription as they were directed by the tyrants, declared that a con&s;piracy exi&s;ted, of which tho&s;e marked on the li&s;ts were the authors, or accom|plices. Per&s;ons who had never &s;een or heard of each other till that moment, were often brought together from different pri|&s;ons to take their trial for the &s;ame con|&s;piracy: and when the decemvirs wi&s;hed to get rid of any particular individual, he was without any he&s;itation added to what was called the <HI>fourn&eacute;e,</HI> the <HI>batch</HI>; for &s;uch was the appellation given to the crowds dragged together to the guillotine, and with &s;uch terms of jocular familiarity was

Sometimes in the hurry, confu&s;ion, and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s with which the&s;e indictments were made out, one per&s;on was mi&s;taken for another. The duche&s;s of Biron, among other in&s;tances, went to the tribunal with an act of accu|&s;ation which was de&s;tined for her &s;teward. The indifference of the tribunal with re|&s;pect to &s;uch errors, enabled mon&s;. Loi|&s;erolles, at &s;ixty years of age, to deceive his barbarous judges, by dying for his &s;on, a youth in his twenty-fir&s;t year. It was ob&s;erved, that this generous parent, who thus a &s;econd time gave life to his child, an&s;wered with uncommon alacrity when his name was called upon, and went with a look of exultation to the &s;caffold. Perhaps hi&s;tory does not offer a more af|fecting in&s;tance of parental tenderne&s;s, making the voluntary &s;acrifice of life to

&s;ave the object of its affection. But this extraordinary epocha called forth the lights and &s;hades of the human character in all their &s;tronge&s;t colouring. The la&s;t exce&s;&s;es of ferocious crimes were con|tra&s;ted by the &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m of the virtuous affections, &s;hedding their &s;weet|ne&s;s like &s;olitary flowers over the wilder|ne&s;s where &s;erpents hi&s;s, and bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t howl; and by the noble&s;t efforts of heroical philanthropy bidding us cea&s;e to de&s;pair of humanity, and converting the throb of indignant horror into the glow of &s;ympathetic admiration;&mdash;bid|ding us turn from the tribunal of blood, from Robe&s;pierre and his jury of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to Loi&s;erolles dying for his child; to madame Berenger, led in the bloom of life to execution with her parents, and, al|together forgetful of her&s;elf, &s;eeking only to &s;upport the &s;inking &s;pirits of her mo|ther;&mdash;to madame Bou&s;quet, the &s;i&s;ter-in-law of Guadet, &s;corning the impious

<P>Among the multitudes who peri&s;hed at this period, all were not armed with the &s;ame fortitude; and &s;ometimes even when tyranny &s;pared the life of its vic|tim, its cruel per&s;ecutions bereaved the &s;ufferer of rea&s;on.

Along the gloomy vaults of that terrific pri&s;on, by the dim light of &s;ickly lamps, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw the mangled &s;pectres of her murdered pa|rents, and in a &s;hort time became entirely bereft of rea&s;on. She ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;tenance, and remained motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, holding to her bo&s;om her parrot,

whom &s;he had in&s;i&s;ted on bringing with her to her dungeon. When conjured by the other pri&s;oners to take &s;ome nouri&s;h|ment, &s;he only an&s;wered, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I want nothing.&mdash;No, he wants nothing.&mdash;My parrot is like me, he wants nothing."</NOTE>Je n'ai be&s;oin de rien."

<P>The Poli&s;h prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka uni|ted with &s;uperior talents all the charms of early youth and di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty. She had been travelling through different countries of Europe; and two years &s;ince was compelled to leave Berne in Switzer|land, on account of the attachment &s;he
<PB N="106" REF="116">
had avowed to the cau&s;e of the French revolution. She came with her hu&s;band to Paris, and cultivated the &s;ociety and friend&s;hip of Vergniaud and of other de|puties of the convention, who were the mo&s;t eminent for their talents and their zeal for liberty. This democratic prince&s;s, to whom a true republican would have offered a <HI>civic</HI> crown, became an object of re&s;entment to the vindictive Robe&s;pierre, on account of her friend&s;hip for &s;ome members of the Gironde: &s;he was thrown into pri&s;on, from thence &s;ent to the re|volutionary tribunal, and condemned by the jury of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to die. Being in a &s;tate of pregnancy, her execution was de|ferred. In the mean time her friends gave information of her danger to Ko&s;ciu&s;ko, the Poli&s;h general, and de&s;ired his inter|po&s;ition in her behalf. Ko&s;ciu&s;ko in&s;tant|ly di&s;patched a letter to Robe&s;pierre, de|claring that the prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka had ever &s;hewn the mo&s;t devoted attachment
<PB N="107" REF="117">
to the principles of liberty, and conjuring Robe&s;pierre to &s;pare the life of a zealous friend to the common cau&s;e in which France and Poland were engaged. Ro|be&s;pierre, after reading the letter, ex|claimed, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"What! pardon for a prince&s;s!&mdash;Ah, Ko&s;|ciu&s;ko!&mdash;let her be guillotined."</NOTE>Quoi! grace pour une prin|ce&s;&s;e!&mdash;Ah, Ko&s;ciu&s;ko!&mdash;qu'on la guil|lotine." The unhappy prince&s;s, having mi&s;carried, was immediately &s;ent to exe|cution.&mdash;Two days before the fall of Robe&s;pierre, eight women who had been re&s;pited having declared them&s;elves preg|nant, were dragged to the &s;caffold. Among this number was the prince&s;s of Monaco. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the court of the pri|&s;on, &s;he &s;aid to the pri&s;oners who were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion, and bid a la&s;t farewell to the companions of their misfortunes, "I go to death with the calm|ne&s;s which innocence in&s;pires, and wi&s;h you from my &s;oul a better fate." Then ad|dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="108" REF="118">
her&s;elf to one of the turnkeys who was leading her towards the cham|ber where the executioner waited to bind the victims, "I have one favour to a&s;k you," &s;aid &s;he, taking a pacquet from her bo&s;om, "will you promi&s;e to grant it? This pacquet contains my hair: I im|plore your compa&s;&s;ion, I conjure you in my own name, in the name of all who hear me, &s;end it to my &s;on, to whom it is directed; &s;wear to me in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e virtuous per&s;ons, whom the &s;ame de&s;tiny as mine awaits, that you will render me this la&s;t &s;ervice which I re|quire of humanity." The di&s;may and ter|ror of one of her women who was involved in the pro&s;cription, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the firmne&s;s &s;he her&s;elf di&s;|played. "Take courage, my dear friend," cried the prince&s;s, "take courage, it is the guilty only who ought to fear."&mdash;The pri&s;on of Port Libre offered an af|fecting &s;pectacle of filial piety. Madame
<PB N="109" REF="119">
Lachabeau&s;&s;iere, in con&s;equence of a ma|lignant denunciation made again&s;t her by her &s;on-in-law, was not only dragged to pri&s;on, but placed in a dungeon in clo&s;e confinement till the moment arrived when &s;he was to appear before the tribunal. Her daughter, madame Male&s;&s;i, who was already confined in another pri&s;on, pro|cured leave to be transferred to that where her mother was immured, whom by tears and &s;upplications &s;he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee. Madame Lachabeau&s;|&s;iere was taken out of her dungeon, and led to her daughter, who flew towards her, and, throwing her arms round her neck, remained a long time pre&s;&s;ing her mother to her bo&s;om, and without power to articulate a word. After this melan|choly interview, madame Lachabeau&s;&s;iere was led back to her dungeon. Her &s;itu|ation affected her daughter &s;o deeply that &s;he became bereft of her rea&s;on. Some|times &s;he took up her needle-work for a

few moments; then throwing it a&s;ide, ro&s;e with precipitation, and flew along the galleries of the pri&s;on till &s;he reached her mother's cell. She u&s;ually &s;eated her&s;elf at the door, and li&s;tened attentively: when &s;he could hear nothing, &s;he u&s;ed to weep bitterly, and repeat again and again in a tone of de&s;pair, "Oh, my mother! Oh, my tender, my unfortunate mother!" She often remained many hours together, &s;eat|ed upon the &s;tone-floor, and &s;he was in a &s;tate of pregnancy. Her hair hung di&s;he|velled over her &s;houlders, her eye &s;eemed bent on vacancy, her cheeks were &s;ome|times flu&s;hed with deep red, and &s;ome|times of a deadly palene&s;s, and &s;he was often &s;eized with convul&s;ive faintings. Every day &s;he carried the greate&s;t por|tion of her food to her mother, who without this &s;uccour would have often wanted &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment for her &s;up|port. It is &s;oothing to add, that madame Lachabeau&s;&s;iere was &s;natched from death
<PB N="111" REF="121">
by the fall of the tyrant, and that her tender and virtuous daughter is re&s;tored to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>While the tyrants, far from finding any &s;atiety of blood in their daily murders, were erecting new ranges of &s;eats in the hall of the revolutionary tribunal, &s;uffi|cient to contain an hundred in&s;tead of fifty accu&s;ed per&s;ons, death now hovered in a new form over the pri&s;ons. The admini&s;trators of the police went to each pri&s;on attended by a &s;trong guard, and ordered the pri&s;oners to be &s;hut up in their re&s;pective chambers, and not &s;uf|fered to have any communication till the purpo&s;e of the vi&s;it was effected. They then went &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to every apart|ment, and demanded of the pri&s;oners their knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, razors, buckles, watches, and all the money they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e unhappy per&s;ons, being altogether ignorant of the object of the vi&s;it, had no time to conceal any thing,
<PB N="112" REF="122">
and were &s;tripped of all they had except fifty livres in paper, which each pri&s;oner was &s;uffered to retain in order to pay for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. But from this day fa|mine &s;cowled along the&s;e gloomy man|&s;ions, adding to the pangs of mental &s;uf|ferings tho&s;e of debility and di&s;ea&s;e. The pri&s;oners were no longer permitted to receive their daily meals from their own hou&s;es, or from a tavern; but were ordered from henceforth, in conformity to the laws of equality, to eat &agrave; la ga|melle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Out of one di&s;h at a common table.</NOTE>. Their food was provided for them at the rate of fifty &s;ous a day, by a cook placed in the pri&s;on. Their nou|ri&s;hment con&s;i&s;ted of one meal in twenty-four hours, often too &s;canty to &s;atisfy the calls of hunger, and &s;ometimes com|po&s;ed of &s;uch nau&s;eous diet as the great|er part of the pri&s;oners were unable to eat.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="123">
Age and infirmity were denied every indulgence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the di&s;|ordered frame, or rai&s;e the &s;inking &s;pirits. A little bread &s;aved from this wretched meal, and water, was all that could be ob|tained during the re&s;t of the day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even the pri&s;oners of war were compelled to &s;ubmit to this rigorous treatment. General O'Hara has &s;ince told me, that after having avoided the ga|melle for &s;ome weeks on the plea of illne&s;s, he was at length forced to &s;hare the common evil. His friends in England will be glad to hear that he is now re|lea&s;ed from his lodgings in a pri&s;on, and from a gendarme when he walks out, and is gone on his parole to Chantilly.</NOTE>. To this meal the pri&s;oners at the Luxem|bourg, where nine hundred per&s;ons were confined, were &s;ummoned in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of three hundred at a time, by a great bell, which called them to a hall, at the door of which &s;tood the jailor, who had been an executioner under Collot d'Her|bois
<PB N="114" REF="124">
at Lyons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The keeper of the pri&s;on at the time we were in confinement, Benoit, di&s;tingui&s;hed in Paris by the epithet of the bon Benoit, had long before this pe|riod been turned out of office, being unfit to execute the purpo&s;es of his ma&s;ters.</NOTE>. This man was re|markably tall, big, and mu&s;cular; his arms were bare to the elbow; he wore a fierce red cap, which had now become the &s;ymbol of blood, and looked as if he were prepared for a ma&s;&s;acre. He only &s;uffered twenty per&s;ons at a time to enter the hall, and then flinging the door in the faces of the others, obliged them to remain in the pa&s;&s;ages till tho&s;e within were &s;eated at the table. The hour of dinner pa&s;&s;ed like the other hours of the day, in gloomy and unbroken &s;ilence; for even the &s;oothing intercour&s;e of conver&s;ation was now forbidden, under the penalty of be|ing dragged immediately before the tri|bunal, &s;ince the &s;pies placed in the pri|&s;ons, whenever they ob&s;erved two or
<PB N="115" REF="125">
three per&s;ons talking together, inquired &s;ternly if they were forming a con&s;piracy. What mo&s;t occupied the minds of the pri|&s;oners at this period was contriving the means of e&s;caping from their tyrants by a voluntary death, which was now be|come difficult, &s;ince they had ben &s;trip|ped of every in&s;trument which could have &s;erved that purpo&s;e. Such was the &s;itua|tion of the&s;e unhappy victims of tyran|ny, when on the night of the 9th of Thermidor the toc&s;in &s;ounded, and the city was called to arms. Many circum|&s;tances which I &s;hall afterwards relate, led the pri&s;oners to believe that the&s;e &s;ounds were the &s;ignal of a general ma&s;|&s;acre. But the toc&s;in now rung the joy|ful, the triumphant peal of liberty. Be|fore I give you a detail of the &s;cenes which pa&s;&s;ed on the 9th of Thermidor, I mu&s;t trace the political events which led to that memorable epocha, and re&s;cued France from a &s;tate which was the a&s;|toni&s;hment
<PB N="116" REF="126">
and &s;hame of human nature; from a &s;tate more terrible than all which the mo&s;t cunning tyrant could have in|flicted upon &s;laves whom he had previ|ou&s;ly di&s;armed. And all this was &s;uf|fered by a nation which called it&s;elf free, which had taken up arms to a&s;&s;ert its freedom, and gained the mo&s;t glorious victories in its defence. France, covered with all the laurels of heroic valour, and the terror of combined Europe, held out her neck to vulgar a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and execu|tioners, in&s;tead of crumbling them into du&s;t.&mdash;Such are the &s;trange contradic|tions of human nature! The effects re|&s;ulting from the terrible impul&s;e of re|volutionary government upon the moral world, may perhaps be compared to tho&s;e produced upon the natural &s;cene by the tremendous tempe&s;ts which &s;ome|times &s;weep along the we&s;tern i&s;lands; when the mingled elements ru&s;h forth in irre&s;i&s;tible fury, when the deluging wa|ters

bear away vegetation, trees, and rocks, and the &s;hrieking whirlwinds &s;hake the dwellings of man to their foundations.&mdash;The &s;torm is pa&s;t&mdash;the enormous vapours have rolled away&mdash;a &s;oft light hovers on the horizon, and we are now left at lei&s;ure to &s;igh over the ruins that &s;urround us, and lament the victims laid pro&s;trate by the bla&s;t.

<P>I cannot however promi&s;e you any very intere&s;ting detail: the hotel Talaru, con|verted into a mai&s;on d'arr&ecirc;t of the &s;ection Lepelletier, has been the &s;cene of no very

remarkable events. It never was reck|oned in the number of tho&s;e fatal dep&ocirc;ts which were called the antichambers of the guillotine. But it is probable that it would have had its turn al&s;o. There is even room to believe that it would not have been long delayed, if the ninth of Thermidor had not, for our good fortune, deranged certain <HI>anthropophagical</HI> mea|&s;ures announced by Barrere in the &s;itting of the convention previous to that day. But I am anticipating facts; and as I have to write a journal, and not an epic poem, I &s;hall keep within chronological order.</P>
<P>Though my re&s;idence in Paris does not exceed twelve years, I have witne&s;&s;ed the building of the hotel Talaru, in the rue Richelieu, now rue de la Loi, near the national library, by the marquis of that name; who was fir&s;t ma&icirc;tre-d'h&ocirc;tel to the queen. Con&s;iderably reduced in his fortune by the new order of things,
<PB N="121" REF="131">
the citizen Talaru took la&s;t year the re|&s;olution of leaving his hotel, and of withdrawing into the adjoining hou&s;e, which al&s;o belonged to him, and which was called the little hotel Talaru. He let the great hotel to one Genc&eacute;, a ta|vern-keeper, who intended to make it a furni&s;hed hotel. Genc&eacute;, on reflection, thought that it was not probable that any con&s;iderable number of foreigners would come to Paris under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, or that the citizens of the departments would now find Paris a very plea&s;ant abode; and fearful that he had made a bad &s;peculation, he was anxious to rid him&s;elf of the affair. We had now reached that di&s;a&s;trous period when mai&s;ons d'arr&ecirc;t &s;prang up in every quar|ter; when every &s;ection in Paris had its exclu&s;ive pri&s;ons at the &s;ervice of its re|volutionary committee; and Genc&eacute; pro|po&s;ed the hotel Talaru to the revolution|ary committee of the &s;ection Lepelletier,
<PB N="122" REF="132">
to be applied to this patriotic purpo&s;e. His propo&s;al was accepted, and the agreement made; but I have never learnt what were the conditions. A German porter was put into this new pri&s;on, and the mine became worth the digging.</P>
<P>In reality, all whom their evil de&s;|tiny led hither were made to pay for their lodging a mo&s;t exorbitant price. Such was in a &s;hort time the fate of Talaru him&s;elf. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, on account of his age and infirmities, to have a room to him&s;elf; and he obtain|ed this &s;pecial favour at the rate of 18 livres a day, that is, paying almo&s;t as much for his &s;mall apartment as he him&s;elf was paid for the whole hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was the eighth per&s;on who was lodged in a beautiful &s;aloon on the ground floor towards the garden. We each paid four livres a day. This &s;aloon therefore brought in three hundred livres a decade, nine hundred and &s;ixty livres a month,
<PB N="123" REF="133">
ten thou&s;and two hundred and fifty livres a year; and the whole hotel was let by the proprietor for &s;even thou&s;and livres. What became of this exorbitant rent, and among whom were the &s;poils divided, as I have never been in the &s;ecret, I can give no information on that head.</P>
<P>On the 10th of Thermidor we were about two hundred pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on complained of the&s;e ex|tortions, he was an&s;wered, "Citizen, you are at liberty to leave this place, and if you like you may be transferred el&s;e|where." But the fear of being thrown into &s;ome one of tho&s;e hou&s;es which were premature graves, made us bear with re|&s;ignation the ills we had.</P>
<P>It was on the 19th of Prairial that I exchanged my own mode&s;t apartment for the fine &s;aloon in que&s;tion. The order of the committee of public &s;afety by which I was arre&s;ted, did not expre&s;s in what pri&s;on I &s;hould be confined. I

a&s;ked therefore the agent of the commit|tee, who was the bearer of the warrant, conjointly with two members of the re|volutionary committee of my own &s;ec|tion, if I might be allowed to choo&s;e my pri&s;on? He an&s;wered courteou&s;ly, that he did not wi&s;h for any thing more than to oblige me.</P>

<P>Happily things did not proceed to this extremity. I referred my&s;elf to the know|ledge and kind offices of my courteous agent, and he carried me to the hotel Talaru. I found on my entrance an

order of things altogether different from what I had expected. I thought that all the mai&s;ons d'arr&ecirc;t were at this period equally guarded, and treated with the &s;ame rigour, and prepared my&s;elf for &s;o|litary confinement and the <HI>gamelle.</HI> But I found the communication among the pri&s;oners perfectly free: they vi&s;ited each other without any impediment, and even the communication without was attended with very little difficulty. I &s;aw &s;ome receive their wives and chil|dren, others their friends and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Per&s;ons of both &s;exes met together; every one amu&s;ed him&s;elf as he thought proper, and fared as he liked. If it was not the image of <HI>liberty,</HI> it was at lea&s;t that of <HI>equality</HI> and <HI>&s;raternity</HI>; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Well! if we mu&s;t build our tabernacles here, &s;o let it be!" How many per&s;ons whom I knew were much more to be pitied than my&s;elf! The art of contentment is to look not at what is

better, but what is wor&s;e than our own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Here then, for the third time &s;ince the in&s;titution of the republic, was I depriv|ed de la cl&eacute;f des champs; "of the key of the fields."&mdash;I have perhaps more merit than many others in loving the republic, which has co&s;t me more per|&s;onal vexations than I had ever dreamt of &s;uffering.</P>
<P>The very day of its proclamation (21&s;t September 1792, O. S.) I was arre&s;ted at Seves, for twenty-four hours, from having met the municipality and the military force of the place, at the hou&s;e of one of my friends whom they were come to take to pri&s;on, and who was then gone to Paris to confound the calumny of his per&s;ecutors before the committee of general &s;afety. The fir&s;t anniver&s;ary of this &s;ame day, twenty fu&s;ileers took me from my bed at five in the morning, and I was

<P>My fir&s;t regrets were be&s;towed on the fe&s;tival of the following day; that which was celebrated in honour of the Supreme Being. My ab&s;ence from this national &s;olemnity gave me pain. Notwith&s;tand|ing all that has been &s;aid of the decree of the convention expre&s;&s;ing the adhe&s;ion of the French nation to the immutable principles of all morality and all wor|&s;hip, I cannot help ob&s;erving that this decree is one of tho&s;e propo&s;ed by Ro|be&s;pierre which I di&s;approved the lea&s;t. Atrocious di&s;turbers of &s;ocial order, by carrying to their utmo&s;t length the mo&s;t impious abominations, had thrown on republican France a general odium. Ju&s;|tice
<PB N="131" REF="141">
had overtaken the&s;e per&s;ons; but the coale&s;ced powers were not le&s;s careful to take advantage of this delirium, and di&s;|credit the cau&s;e of liberty with their own people, by treating as <HI>athei&s;ts,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as univer&s;al <HI>di&s;organizers,</HI> its parti&s;ans and friends. The national repre&s;entation was willing to give an authentic and formal de|nial to this calumny; and it is true that in this point of view the decree had a good effect. The convention never entertain|ed the ab&s;urd idea of decreeing that God exi&s;ted, that the &s;oul was immortal, and that the French ought to believe this becau&s;e &s;uch was the good plea&s;ure of the legi&s;lature. It meant, by a declara|tion of a kind as new as the circum|&s;tances were in which it was placed, to ab&s;olve and exculpate a great nation from tho&s;e calumnious imputations &s;eized on by its enemies to &s;erve their views; and I repeat it, all the friends of principle have applauded the decree, and I con|fe&s;s

that I was enthu&s;ia&s;tic in its fa|vour.</P>
<P>It was for its object, and not the mode of celebrating the fe&s;tival of the 20th of Prairial, that I regretted my ab&s;ence from it. The mode I had judg|ed before hand would be a &s;eries of pan|tomimes and <HI>harlequinades</HI>; and during a long walk I had taken in the country a few days before, I had lamented the de|va&s;tation made in the woods, and in par|ticular among the young trees around Paris; a deva&s;tation which extended over the whole &s;urface of the republic, and of which our &s;ons as well as our&s;elves will feel the &s;ad effects.</P>

It was common enough, however, to have a news-paper &s;muggled in, and then it was privately handed about, and &s;ought after with anxious curio&s;ity, for we ne|ver failed learning the death of &s;ome ac|quaintance or friend; but we were in|formed al&s;o of the &s;ucce&s;s of our armies; and their victories &s;ometimes compen&s;ated for our individual pains and &s;ufferings.</P>

Judge how well he was que&s;|tioned on his entrance; and it happened pretty often, that <HI>through inadvertence</HI> he had left the "journal of debates and decrees" at the bottom of his pocket. In the meanwhile we killed the pre&s;ent time, and &s;hut our eyes on the future, by play and bodily exerci&s;es; &s;uch as bat|tledore and &s;huttlecock, and fives: we fea&s;ted, read, and made <HI>bout-rim&eacute;s.</HI> I frequently partook of the two la&s;t amu&s;e|ments with a very amiable young man named R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n, and we had a Mu&s;e, who daily amu&s;ed her&s;elf in &s;et|ting up &s;ome prize, which my antago|ni&s;t, I own, generally obtained.

<P>P. S. A &s;ingular anecdote I cannot help relating.</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;elin, one of my fellow-pri&s;oners at the hotel Talaru, had been carried be|fore the revolutionary tribunal, and ac|quitted. He came the next day to vi&s;it his old companions, and impart to us the good news. He informed me on this oc|ca&s;ion, that a Dutchman called Van Hooff had been dragged to the guillotine at the moment when he (Rou&s;&s;elin) en|tered the Conciergerie, and that he lay down on the bed yet warm of this unfor|tunate man, who had ju&s;t left it. Van Hooff was my friend; and his unhappy cata&s;trophe affected me extremely. I was &s;o much the more &s;trongly per&s;uaded of the death of Van Hooff, as it was an|nounced in &s;everal of the public papers: and you may imagine without much difficulty what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when, a fortnight or three weeks after, I received a letter from Van Hooff, in

<P>THE &s;urrender of Lyons, which took place &s;ome days previous to the murder of the deputies of the Gironde, contri|buted to ha&s;ten the execution of that atrocious deed. The Lyonnais had long &s;truggled again&s;t the commi&s;&s;aries of the mountain faction, who, under the pre|tence of an ardent zeal for liberty, were diligent in &s;eeking opportunities for riot and plunder; and however &s;trongly this detachment of con&s;pirators were &s;upport|ed by tho&s;e who directed their motions from Paris, they could not with&s;tand the indignation and vengeance of the citizens of Lyons, who, rou&s;ed by the dangers with which they were threatened, cru&s;hed their oppre&s;&s;ors, the chief of whom, Cha|lier, they &s;ent to the &s;caffold. The Lyonnais
<PB N="151" REF="161">
had proceeded too far to hope for any mercy from the faction, who had now accompli&s;hed their trea&s;on at Paris: and &s;eeing the cau&s;e of liberty abandoned by the departments, who had made their peace with the traitors, they were driven either to &s;uffer patiently the weight of their wrath, or prepare to oppo&s;e it. Of this dreadful alternative they cho&s;e the latter; but finding them&s;elves un&s;upport|ed in the project they had at fir&s;t formed of marching to Paris, they determined to defend their own city. In the mean time they employed the mo&s;t honourable means to explain to the convention, that their re&s;i&s;tance aro&s;e neither from di&s;affection to the republic, nor from any wi&s;h to form a federal government, of which they had been accu&s;ed; that they had &s;worn fidelity to the republican con&s;titu|tion, and had i&s;&s;ued orders to a&s;&s;em|ble the primary a&s;&s;emblies for its ac|ceptance. But re&s;i&s;tance for any cau&s;e
<PB N="152" REF="162">
was now a crime, and this conce&s;&s;ion of the Lyonnais only &s;erved to increa&s;e the in&s;olence of their oppre&s;&s;ors, who decreed that the city was in a &s;tate of rebellion, and that all who had re&s;orted thither from the neighbouring departments &s;hould be treated as emigrants: for the con&s;pirators ea&s;ily perceived that this city might form a central point of oppo&s;ition, by col|lecting together all tho&s;e per&s;ons in the &s;outhern provinces who were aver&s;e to the revolutionary order of things. An army was immediately levied, and ordered to march again&s;t Lyons; and it was be|lieved that when the Lyonnais were in|formed that the affair was about to be|come &s;o &s;erious, they would make no far|ther oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The general who commanded the con|ventional army, endeavoured by proclama|tions to concilia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the parties, but in vain. His propo&s;als of pardon were rejected by tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves injured,
<PB N="153" REF="163">
and who knew by fatal experience what degree of confidence was to be placed in the offer of tender mercies from the cruel. The Lyonnais were allowed three hours to deliberate on the gracious propo&s;itions of the general, but a di&s;charge of cannon returned their an&s;wer before the fir&s;t had expired; and though new proclamations were i&s;&s;ued, and on the anniver&s;ary of the 10th of Augu&s;t both parties &s;ent deputa|tions to celebrate that event together, the Lyonnais continued their warlike oppo|&s;ition, and prepared to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time the department of Mont-Blanc, formerly Savoy, was reco|vered by the Piedmonte&s;e, who took ad|vantage of the ab&s;ence of the army which had been called off for the purpo&s;e of reducing Lyons; and the repre&s;entatives who conducted the operations of the &s;iege wrote to the convention to repeal the de|cree which the con&s;pirators in their wrath
<PB N="154" REF="164">
had poured out again&s;t that city. The Lyonnais were as deaf to the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions as they had been to the proclamations of the generals, who now proceeded to ex|tremities, and began the bombardment of the city, which was &s;et on fire in &s;e|veral places, and a great number of the inhabitants peri&s;hed. Other proclama|tions followed this act of ho&s;tility, which met with the &s;ame reception. The black flag continued floating on the towers, in|dicating re&s;i&s;tance till death; and though the city, being unfortified, had nothing to defend it but the bravery of its inhabi|tants, no impre&s;&s;ion could be made ex|cept by bombardment. The con&s;pirators therefore &s;ent their emi&s;&s;aries into the ad|joining departments to rai&s;e the people <HI>in ma&s;s</HI>; and, if any credit is to be given to the reports of tho&s;e who were employed, the be&s;ieging army was re-inforced by other armies amounting to fifty thou&s;and men. With this re-inforcement the attack be|gan
<PB N="155" REF="165">
afre&s;h, the city was &s;urrounded, all communication cut off, and the conven|tion was informed that famine would &s;oon effect what the ob&s;tinacy of the Lyonnais had hitherto prevented. Du|ring three months the&s;e brave republi|cans contended again&s;t the numerous ar|mies that the con&s;pirators had a&s;&s;embled; and had not their ardour been checked by their commanders, they would all have witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t the cowardice and ba&s;e|ne&s;s of their countrymen, by whom they were left un&s;upported, with the la&s;t drop of their blood. After having performed prodigies of valour, till they were over|powered by numbers, and re&s;i&s;tance be|came no longer po&s;&s;ible, they endeavour|ed to effect their retreat, by forcing their way through the be&s;iegers; for accord|ing to the di&s;patches &s;ent to the conven|tion they were entirely &s;urrounded. In this retreat &s;ome &s;ucceeded; but a great part were cut to pieces, and the con|ventional
<PB N="156" REF="166">
army entered the city in tri|umph.</P>
<P>With the &s;avage joy of the fami&s;hed cannibal, when he &s;eizes on &s;ome &s;hip|wrecked wretch whom the waves have unkindly &s;pared from the fate of his com|panions, the mountain con&s;pirators heard of the reduction of Lyons. The com|mittee of public &s;afety, through the organ of Barrere, in congratulating the conven|tion on the news, informed them that mea&s;ures were taken to exterminate every fugitive; that no weakne&s;s, no mercy &s;hould be &s;hewn; and that this den of con&s;pirators mu&s;t make ample reparation, and that this reparation mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in burying this rebel city under its own ruins. And le&s;t this moment of wrath &s;hould be tran&s;ient, le&s;t the indignation which had filled their capacious &s;ouls &s;hould evaporate, the&s;e guardians of the public weal methodized their vengeance by a decree, which the convention &s;anc|tioned,
<PB N="157" REF="167">
that Lyons &s;hould be razed to the ground, and &s;truck out of the cities of the republic. This "great and vigor|ous mea&s;ure, the total de&s;truction of the city, was the only one that had e&s;caped us," the deputies in mi&s;&s;ion at this devoted place echo to their colleagues of the com|mittee. They had already created mili|tary tribunals to judge the inhabitants; but complete extermination had not been within the reach of their comprehen&s;ion: and le&s;t this example of vengeance &s;hould be lo&s;t to the world by &s;ome mi&s;placed he&s;itation, by &s;ome &s;entiment of weak hu|manity, the committee di&s;patched one of its own members to direct and &s;uperin|tend the execution.</P>
<P>What had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed was &s;carcely the beginning of horrors. Collot d'Her|bois, a comedian, who had been driven from the &s;tage for his profe&s;&s;ional inca|pacity, but who had acted a con&s;iderable part in the con&s;piracy, was gone thither
<PB N="158" REF="168">
to give tragedy &s;ome original &s;trokes. "Alas," &s;ays the eloquent reporter on the corre&s;pondence of Robe&s;pierre and the extent of his enormities, "the terrible in|&s;trument of death, erected only for the puni&s;hment of crimes, &s;prings up like poi&s;onous plants over every part of the republic. It becomes naturali&s;ed under the oppo&s;ite &s;kies of the north and the &s;outh: the frozen bear and the devour|ing dog-&s;tar alike mourn over its fatal &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"O! come; let us penetrate together, my fellow-citizens, acro&s;s tho&s;e fiery tor|rents, under tho&s;e ruined walls which &s;eem crumbling down to threaten us with ruin; let us pa&s;s into tho&s;e cities hereto|fore filled with people, now widowed of their inhabitants; into tho&s;e new de&s;erts more frightful than tho&s;e of Paran or Horeb. See them, like the hyena growl|ing fiercely over its prey!&mdash;Do you not perceive them like de&s;troying demons

ru&s;hing with their devouring torches over every monument of genius or of art? The&s;e new Gengis, who have conquered neither Per&s;ia, nor Egypt, nor Lybia, are anxious to make Frenchmen of the 18th century a race of barbarians, reduced not to the practice, but to the &s;imple reading of the rights of man, as the Saracens were here|tofore in&s;tructed in the knowledge of the Koran.</P>
<P>"Look for a moment with us, on the&s;e vile dilapidations of the trea&s;ures of Pto|lemy Philadelphus; ob&s;erve tho&s;e evil principles, tho&s;e Arimanes, who have been di&s;puting with each other for twelve months pa&s;t the palpitating limbs of our di&s;membered country! What were they, and what are they now, tho&s;e founders of committees of demolition, tho&s;e creators of ruins?&mdash;Vile &s;laves, trembling in the pre&s;ence of the mighty.</P>
<P>"It is the con&s;piracy of folly and of crimes united again&s;t genius and virtue.

It is the in&s;urrection of robbery again&s;t the precept of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine.</HI> It is the reign of private vengeance and the mo&s;t abject pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"O Lyons! city celebrated for thy commerce, who is this new Gengis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gengis, unknown and de&s;pi&s;ed under the name of Themugin, returned as a conqueror to avenge the in&s;ults which he had received. Collot, who knew profe&s;&s;ionally the parts which the Tartar had played, is accu&s;ed of having taken him for a model, and of having avenged, like him, private injuries.</NOTE>, who, with the axe and the thunder in his hand, pours down on thy walls, and ru&s;hes on to avenge the injuries of Themugin? It is fini&s;hed, and thy ruin is &s;worn!"</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k of the unfortunate inhabitants, as I have &s;ometimes done, the hi&s;tory of their woes&mdash;their tyrants blazon them&s;elves their crimes to the open day, and invite you to read the black cata|logue of their enormities. "In de&s;troy|ing a rebel city," &s;ays Collot, "we &s;hall
<PB N="161" REF="171">
con&s;olidate the re&s;t. We mu&s;t leave no|thing but a&s;hes. We demoli&s;h with can|non balls, and with explo&s;ions like tho&s;e of mines." When &s;uch were his principles, his projects, and his exploits, it would be trifling to &s;top to talk of individual di&s;tre&s;&s;es&mdash;to relate how he ordered three ladies, who had thrown them&s;elves at his feet to implore his mercy, to be tied for &s;ix hours to the &s;caffold where their hu&s;|bands were to be executed; or to &s;peak of the execution of a young heroine, who had &s;hewn prodigies of valour during the &s;iege. The&s;e were only interludes in this great tragedy, one of who&s;e langui&s;h|ing actors in his exi&s;ting corre&s;pondence writes, that &s;ince the guillotine has been at work, his health has been e&s;tabli&s;hed; that every thing goes well, and is ex|pected to go better; "&s;ince it is found," continues he, "that the guillotine is not &s;ufficiently expeditious, and in a few days three or four hundred will be di&s;patched
<PB N="162" REF="172">
at a time; and the hou&s;es are fa&s;t demo|li&s;hing."</P>
<P>This was no empty menace&mdash;the tra|gedian executed what this &s;avage had promi&s;ed.&mdash;"The guillotine and fu&s;illade do not go ami&s;s," &s;ays he; "&s;ixty, eighty, two hundred at once are &s;hot, and every day care is taken to arre&s;t a &s;ufficient number, &s;o as not to leave the pri&s;ons empty." But &s;till the&s;e were ordinary means. This new Salmoneus was not contented with the in&s;ignia of the god, he panted to imitate his de&s;troying power; and accordingly &s;ome of the mi&s;erable inhabitants were placed before batteries of cannon; and while they were &s;hattered and torn in pieces by the artillery, though the greater part were left to be di&s;patched the following day by the &s;pades of tho&s;e who came to bury them, Collot amu&s;ed him|&s;elf in beholding the operation.</P>
<P>During this wa&s;te of life, that of the property of the unfortunate victims was
<PB N="163" REF="173">
not more re&s;pected. "It co&s;ts four hun|dred thou&s;and livres each decade for <HI>de|molitions,</HI>" writes one of the&s;e demons, who talks of re-colonizing the country. "More heads every day, more heads are falling. What ec&s;tacies thou would&s;t have felt," adds the mon&s;ter to his corre&s;pond|ent, "if thou had&s;t &s;een this national ju&s;|tice executed on two hundred and nine ra&s;cals! What cement for the republic! We have knocked off five hundred; and when we have di&s;patched twice as many, which we &s;hall do, things will go for|ward."</P>
<P>Where then, it might be a&s;ked, was the convention, while the&s;e horrors were exe|cuting? Where? Alas! this convention, &s;ent by a free people to con&s;olidate their liberty, was in chains. Had it been le&s;s en&s;laved, the decree, that Lyons &s;hould no longer exi&s;t, would have ju&s;tified the executioners.&mdash;Collot was not willing that this decree of deva&s;tation &s;hould remain
<PB N="164" REF="174">
a figure of rhetoric&mdash;he &s;ays &s;o: "The revolutionary army arrives the day after to-morrow, and then," continues he, "I &s;hall be able to perform great things. The&s;e con&s;pirators mu&s;t &s;oon be di&s;patch|ed&mdash;Lyons mu&s;t exi&s;t no longer&mdash;and the in&s;cription thou ha&s;t propo&s;ed," for this letter is addre&s;&s;ed to Robe&s;pierre, "con|tains a great truth, for hitherto the de|cree has been but an <HI>hypothe&s;is.</HI> It will be your bu&s;ine&s;s to make it what it ought to be, and we will prepare the amend|ments before hand."</P>
<P>This was the private corre&s;pondence of the mon&s;ter with Robe&s;pierre. But let us not conceal his language to the conven|tion it&s;elf. "We are hardened," &s;ays he, "again&s;t the tears of repentance&mdash;Indul|gence is a dangerous weakne&s;s&mdash;The de|molitions are too &s;low&mdash;We mu&s;t employ means more adapted to republican impa|tience. The explo&s;ion of the mine, the devouring activity of the flame alone can
<PB N="165" REF="175">
expre&s;s the omnipotence of the people: its will cannot be impeded like that of tyrants; it ought to have the effect of thunder." And what an&s;wer does the con|vention return to its colleague?&mdash;The wretch for a whole year after retained a &s;eat in the a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;It was the plan of Collot to bani&s;h tho&s;e whom he did not de&s;troy; for he found it difficult to carry his purpo&s;e into full execution; and after having murdered a part, and exiled the re&s;t, he di&s;covered that he had fulfilled his commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;hould be able on his return to &s;ay with truth, that Lyons ex|i&s;ted no longer.</P>
<P>"What ideas! what fury!" exclaims the reporter: "it &s;eems as if the moral world was fallen back into chaos. And the&s;e are legi&s;lators! Alas! if the Erebus of the antients had had its legi&s;lation al&s;o, it would undoubtedly have been more con&s;i&s;tent and more humane."</P>
<P>We are at fir&s;t tempted to believe, in
<PB N="166" REF="176">
pa&s;&s;ing in review the&s;e ferocious charac|ters, that all the mon&s;ters of the de&s;ert had quitted their dens to ru&s;h in on our cities; or rather, to adopt more natural ideas, we cannot help di&s;covering the end of the&s;e horrible levellers, which was the de|&s;truction of commerce, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment not of an equality of happine&s;s, but of an equality of mi&s;ery, throughout the republic.</P>
<P>It will &s;carcely be thought po&s;&s;ible, yet it is very generally believed, that Col|lot was led to this vengeance on the peo|ple of Lyons for having hi&s;&s;ed him when he acted on their &s;tage. Thou&s;ands of victims have atoned for the in&s;ult offered to a wretched comedian; and this great city, which from the time of Augu&s;tus had been the centre of the commerce of Gaul, where he lavi&s;hed his favours, and for three ages received the tribute of grati|tude in the honours that were rendered him, had now fallen under the &s;troke of
<PB N="167" REF="177">
the mo&s;t vulgar of tyrants. Had the&s;e mon&s;ters looked for precedents for their cruelties, they might have found them in their prototype Caligula, for in this very city that tyrant once re&s;ided: and the re|&s;emblance of Caligula and Collot is &s;o far &s;triking, that they both exerci&s;ed their de&s;poti&s;m over the &s;ame cla&s;s of citizens; though the motives of Caligula appear to have been more natural than tho&s;e of Collot, and his cruelty more di&s;crimi|nate.</P>
<P>While this tragic ruffian was acting his part at Lyons, others with principles as atrocious, though they were le&s;s &s;teeped in blood, were carrying de&s;olation into other parts of France. Bourdeaux, which had been rai&s;ing it&s;elf to the height of the revolution, was now a prey to the caprice of a young mon&s;ter who had not yet counted twenty years, and who was the valet of Robe&s;pierre in the commi&s;|&s;ion of crimes.

<P>NO cla&s;s of men were more intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of the abu&s;es of the an|cient government than the prie&s;ts. When the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly le&s;&s;ened the in|fluence of the higher clergy, by &s;tripping the church of its domains, and making the &s;alaries of its mini&s;ters more equal, the national wealth was not only increa&s;|ed, but the great ma&s;s of the prie&s;t|hood were &s;atisfied with the di&s;tribution. The majority of tho&s;e who had hitherto directed the machine of the revolution were fully per&s;uaded that the prie&s;thood &s;hared but little in its &s;pirit; and, know|ing that whatever does not keep pace with its career, retards its progre&s;s, had &s;ought at different times to di&s;&s;olve the
<PB N="170" REF="180">
alliance of the church and &s;tate alto|gether. They felt indeed that the article in the declaration of rights, which &s;ays "that no one &s;hall be di&s;turbed in his religious opinions," mu&s;t be eventually &s;ubver&s;ive of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; &s;ince whoever believed it to be not only unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive, but ho&s;tile to the great principles of liberty, would murmur at contributing to its &s;upport.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of the clergy re|fu&s;ed to accede to the civil con&s;titution which the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly had form|ed, alleging that in matters of religion, or in the regulations of the church, no one ought to guide their faith, or receive their obedience, but the per&s;onage who, in con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the great author of chri&s;tianity, had held the dele|gated power. This cla&s;s had by their non-conformity lo&s;t their employment, but they were not the le&s;s cheri&s;hed on that account by tho&s;e who thought
<PB N="171" REF="181">
with them&s;elves, that man was made for the &s;abbath, and not the &s;abbath for man. The zeal of the&s;e non-jurors for the faith which they contended was once delivered to the &s;aints, was too ardent to &s;uffer this humiliation of the church in &s;ilence; nor was the vigilance of the friends of the re|volution le&s;s awake to counteract their ef|forts. The maje&s;ty of the church, of which they believed them&s;elves to be the only true &s;upporters, would not permit them to bow before the maje&s;ty of the people; and when the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly under|took to be the interpreters of the law, and enacted decrees for the bani&s;hment of the uncon&s;titutional clergy, they &s;ought refuge in the maje&s;ty of the throne, the cheri&s;hed ally hi herto of the church, who&s;e power was at this time &s;carcely more confirmed than its own.</P>

of both<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of that eventful period which overthrew both the monarchy and the church in France, madame Roland has left us many curious particulars. The principal actors are now no more, except Servan and Dumourier&mdash;all the re&s;t having peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold. See Appendix, No. III.</NOTE>. The king refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to &s;anction the decree of the legi&s;lative a&s;|&s;embly, who however at length prevail|ed: and when the royal power was an|nihilated, which happened not long after, the prie&s;ts were compelled to &s;eek a&s;y|lums of charity, in foreign countries, of tho&s;e who&s;e ance&s;tors had fled from the bloody per&s;ecutions of their order, but who&s;e injuries the &s;ons had forgotten; or if &s;till remembered, they perhaps an|&s;wered as Gui&s;e did to Poltrot, "If your religion enjoins you to murder, ours compels us to forgive."</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the national con|vention was &s;till more unfavourable than that of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly to the
<PB N="173" REF="183">
civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of the clergy. The truth is, that the enlightened part of the country had con&s;idered religion as a per|&s;onal thing. Tho&s;e who believed, of which the number was not very great, thought the protection of the &s;tate no addition to its dignity; and tho&s;e who di&s;believed, or, which was the &s;ame, con|founded the doctrines of chri&s;tianity and the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, thought that its alliance was not only burden&s;ome, but pernicious. The great divi&s;ions of the contending parties for the government gave the prie&s;thood re&s;pite. But no &s;ooner was this que&s;tion decided, and the reign of Robe&s;pierre e&s;tabli&s;hed, than the men of rea&s;on, as they called them&s;elves, re|newed the attack again&s;t the men of the church, who were unable to make any farther re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutional clergy had no pro|tection but that which was given them by the con&s;titution now pro&s;cribed, and
<PB N="174" REF="184">
had in&s;pired no intere&s;t in the devotees, who con&s;idered them rather as apo&s;tates from religion, than defenders of the faith; and treacherous guides in the road of &s;alvation, on account of their compliance with the law.</P>
<P>A &s;trict adherence to the ceremonies and doctrines of the Romi&s;h church was not the only &s;uper&s;tition that darkened France. There was another of a more terrible nature, and more de&s;tructive of &s;ocial order, which was athei&s;m. Vol|taire has ob&s;erved, that a rea&s;oning athei&s;t is a greater &s;courge to mankind, than the mo&s;t &s;anguinary fanatic. The com|mune of Paris had a&s;&s;umed this charac|ter; and, having twice contributed to overturn the civil government of the country in the &s;pace of a few months, imagined that the kingdom of the next world was to be taken by force as well as the kingdom of the pre&s;ent. This formidable project was conceived, and
<PB N="175" REF="185">
brought to maturity in mode&s;t &s;ilence. The good people of Paris, who had troubled them&s;elves but little about re|ligion, but who imagined that there might be &s;omething good in it, as there is in the wor&s;t of vocations, were ex|tremely &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the archbi&s;hop of Paris, with his clergy, pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the bar of the convention, attended by the con&s;tituted powers of the department and the municipality, "to be regene|rated;" that is, to abjure their former belief, and make their new confe&s;&s;ion of faith, in which they declared that there was no other duty than liberty, no other go&s;pel than the republican con&s;titution, and no other wor&s;hip than equality. This illumination was not the re&s;ult of the deep &s;tudies either of the archbi&s;hop or his vicars. The &s;ecret was imparted to him by Chaumette, the procureur of the commune, to whom it was di&s;covered by one Clootz, commonly called Ana|char&s;is,
<PB N="176" REF="186">
a Pru&s;&s;ian by birth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> an athei&s;t by profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e hi&s;tory I have already related. Clootz had writ|ten a book, which he told the conven|tion on pre&s;enting it was the fruit of fifteen hours labour every day during the cour&s;e of four years. He al&s;o in|&s;tructed them that this work, &s;ingular in its method and curious in its detail, over|turned at one &s;troke all fects, antient or modern, of natural or revealed religion.&mdash;Of this work, which "proved the nothingne&s;s of all religion," the conven|tion decreed the acceptance, and honour|able mention; and, thus armed, Ana|char&s;is &s;et out on his travels to convert the world to athei&s;m. There was &s;ome|thing ma&s;terly in his fir&s;t attempt; and had he been &s;atisfied with the conver&s;ion of the archbi&s;hop and the commune, whom he brought to the bar of the con|vention, he might have enjoyed his tri|umph in &s;ecurity; but when he attempt|ed
<PB N="177" REF="187">
to pro&s;elyte the convention it&s;elf, Robe&s;pierre oppo&s;ed the invader with his doctrine of the Supreme Being, and Anachar&s;is was &s;ent to the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg. There a friend of mine found him in daily controver&s;y with Thomas Paine, who had ju&s;t written "The Age of Rea&s;on," for his credulity in &s;till indulging &s;o many religious and political prejudices. Soon after, this vain enthu&s;ia&s;t was &s;ent by his polemic antagoni&s;t Robe&s;pierre to the guillotine, where many of his converts in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion followed him, and among his pupils was the archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Many of the bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts who were deputies in the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;ome of the mini&s;ters of the prote&s;tant faith, animated by the example of the arch|bi&s;hop, made their public recantation. Of this la&s;t &s;ect one ob&s;erved that, though his &s;y&s;tem of faith inculcated, more than any other, moral obligations, yet, as the

great day of judgment was arrived, the reign of rea&s;on, the triumph of philo&s;o|phy, he mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of his &s;acer|dotal character, and become regenerated al&s;o, &s;ince, as he confe&s;&s;ed, "tous les pr&ecirc;tres dans tous les cultes ont toujours un peu de charlatani&s;me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All prie&s;ts of all religions have a little &s;pice of the mountebank.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in the members of one profe&s;&s;ion provoked the &s;ame candour in tho&s;e of another. The prie&s;ts having confe&s;&s;ed that there was a little quackery in their admini&s;tration of the next world, the phy&s;icians crowded to the bar of the commune, to acknowledge that they had been "un peu pr&ecirc;tres" al&s;o, and that a little &s;pice of mountebank dealing en|tered into their admini&s;tration of this. Admitting that nature and rea&s;on were the be&s;t remedies, they made offerings of their diplomas by which they had been
<PB N="179" REF="189">
authori&s;ed to cure <HI>&s;ecundum artem,</HI> in direct contradiction to both; and this virtuous dereliction of their former prac|tice was rewarded with applau&s;es and civic in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Reformation, as well as terror, was the order of the day: the &s;earching eye of the commune left nothing unexplored. To the epuration of the prie&s;ts and phy|&s;icians &s;ucceeded that of the comedians, who had no profe&s;&s;ional &s;ins to confe&s;s, &s;ince they had acted their parts on the &s;tage of the world without any di&s;gui&s;e. However, the commune thought that tho&s;e who had been in the habitude of per&s;onating princes, and nobles, and queens, and counte&s;&s;es, could little reli&s;h habits of equality, and therefore &s;ent to pri&s;on both actors and actre&s;&s;es as &s;u&s;|pected.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of reform did not &s;top at the con&s;ecration of the &s;poils of the church to the &s;ervices of the &s;tate. It
<PB N="180" REF="190">
&s;eized on tho&s;e privileges which in all countries, and under every e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, have been accorded with the common con&s;ent of mankind, and on the exerci&s;e of which much of the order and happine&s;s of the world has been thought to depend. On our entrance into the world it is the prie&s;t who confers on us our moral exi&s;tence; in riper days it is he who hallows our affections; and with|out his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion we have been taught to think that our road to heaven was not altogether &s;ecure. Of the two fir&s;t of the&s;e functions, the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;the fathers brought their children to be regenerated at the municipal font, and the lover led his blu&s;hing mi&s;tre&s;s before the altar of Hy|men, and received her from the hand of the civil officer, who pronounced their union "in the name of the law." The care of di&s;po&s;ing of the citizens at death yet remained to the church, and the fu|nerals
<PB N="181" REF="191">
continued to darken the way in long proce&s;&s;ions, till the commune &s;eized on this la&s;t prerogative of the clergy, and decreed, that gay revolutionary colours of the nation &s;hould take place of the funereal pall&mdash;the prie&s;ts &s;hould be changed into municipal officers, and the cemetery &s;hould be called the place of repo&s;e, where, in&s;tead of the hope of be|ing troubled with a re&s;urrection, the ci|tizen &s;hould have the privilege of &s;leep|ing for ever.</P>
<P>The church of Notre Dame was changed into the temple of Rea&s;on; and the commune, with the divinity her&s;elf, attended by a &s;plendid train, came to reque&s;t the convention to &s;anctify with their pre&s;ence the con&s;ecration. The Godde&s;s of Rea&s;on was a fine blooming dam&s;el of the opera-hou&s;e, and acted her part in this comedy al&s;o to the entire &s;atisfaction of her new votaries. From her imperial throne, in which &s;he was
<PB N="182" REF="192">
borne by four porters, &s;he de&s;cended to the right hand of the pre&s;ident of the conven|tion, and by a decree received the fraternal ki&s;s, as &s;oon as the procureur of the com|mune, who attended as high prie&s;t, or ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, had announced her negative and po&s;itive character; "fir&s;t, that &s;he was not, like the objects of the ancient wor&s;hip, a cold and inanimate image; and next, that &s;he was a ma&s;ter|piece of nature; and that her &s;acred form had &s;o enflamed every heart, that only one univer&s;al cry was heard, "No more prie&s;ts, and no other gods!"</P>
<P>When the deputies arrived at the temple, the Godde&s;s of Rea&s;on introduced them to the Godde&s;s of Liberty, who came out of the hou&s;e of Philo&s;ophy, to receive their homage, and be&s;tow her benediction. The enemies of the revo|lution encouraged the&s;e follies, which the patriot di&s;avowed and lamented: and the philo&s;opher would only have &s;miled at
<PB N="183" REF="193">
the&s;e tran&s;ient puerilities, had they not been mixed with atrocity and crimes. Alas! the re&s;pect for Rea&s;on was as fleeting as the re&s;pect for other &s;trange gods; for her altars were &s;oon de&s;erted, and her high prie&s;ts, and the divinity her|&s;elf, were &s;oon after conducted amid&s;t the applau&s;es of the people to the guillotine. Immediately after the regeneration of the metropolitan, tho&s;e who felt the &s;ame conviction of its nece&s;&s;ity made con|fe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and applied for the conventional ble&s;&s;ing. This conviction neverthele&s;s was far from being general in either profe&s;&s;ion; for though the con|&s;titutional clergy were attached to the cau&s;e of liberty, and rejoiced in the re|generation of their country, they did not imagine that the belief of reward in a future &s;tate would make a le&s;s virtuous citizen of the pre&s;ent. This counter-revolutionary ob&s;tinacy was held in great indignation. Though the commune had
<PB N="184" REF="194">
called on Rea&s;on, like the prie&s;ts of Baal, "from morning until noon," the votaries at her &s;hrine were few and &s;oli|tary, and it became nece&s;&s;ary for the honour of the godde&s;s, that more revo|lutionary mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued. Accordingly, attended by the committees of the &s;ections, and the popular &s;ocieties of Paris, the municipality appeared a &s;econd time at the bar of the convention, where, after a philippic again&s;t the unre|canting clergy, they demanded the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of their &s;alaries, and that tho&s;e who believed in "the tales of augurs &s;hould pay them." The convention, who probably had as little faith in augurs as the commune, had however more charity, and deferred the &s;entence of famine, which the municipality had decreed. The commune, though it did not &s;uc|ceed in the attack on the prie&s;thood, was more &s;ucce&s;sful in its attacks on the church. The word of order was
<PB N="185" REF="195">
i&s;&s;ued, and the &s;treets of Paris were filled with mock religious proce&s;&s;ions. The mo&s;t ludicrous ma&s;querades pre&s;ented them&s;elves in every quarter; pioneers and artillery-men led the march, clothed in the &s;urplices of the inferior clergy; the national guard were arrayed in the habits of the prie&s;ts; the revolutionary citizens of the &s;ection were ve&s;ted in garments &s;till more co&s;tly; the revolutionary ladies and the prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Rea&s;on had &s;ancti|fied them&s;elves with the dre&s;&s;es belonging to the Virgin, and St. Frances and St. Bridget; and the revolutionary committee had re&s;erved for their own decoration, with great prudence, all the garments of fine gold, embroidery and jewels, while the caps of the prie&s;ts and the mitres were placed on the heads of the hor&s;es employed in dragging the&s;e weighty &s;poils, which were to be pre&s;ented to the con|vention. The&s;e offerings con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="186" REF="196">
cro&s;&s;es, &s;uns, va&s;es, chandeliers, and cha&s;es, apo&s;tles and &s;aints in gold and &s;ilver, St. Anthony and his pig, St. Roche and his dog, and all the other &s;aints re|gi&s;tered in the calendar who were found to be of the &s;ame metallic worth. From the convention, after undergoing the &s;en|tence of condemnation for ari&s;tocratical and counter-revolutionary principles, they were &s;ent to be regenerated at the mint, and make expiation for the long &s;eries of impo&s;itions they had been practi&s;ing on the world, by becoming, under a new form, the protectors of liberty and the republic.</P>
<P>The wooden &s;aints, who in moral and religious e&s;timation were equal, and often|times &s;uperior, in paradi&s;aical rank to their brethren, though their con&s;ideration in the&s;e moments of irreligious phren&s;y was infinitely le&s;s, were committed, with|out remor&s;e, to the flames at the place of

execution. And into the &s;ame unhallowed fire were thrown tho&s;e ine&s;timable trea|&s;ures which had been for ages the con&s;olation of the &s;uffering believer, and the refuge of the faithful and pious. Amid the &s;acrilegious pile lay three eyes of the evangeli&s;ts; a blue jacket, be|daubed with paint, taken from the ward|robe of St. Luke; a piece of ragged tent cloth, that had been purcha&s;ed from the warehou&s;e of St. Paul, and his cloak, which had been left with Carpus; a few of the coats and garments of St. Dorcas, which the weeping widows had &s;hewn to St. Peter; all which, with other relics &s;till more precious, &s;uch as &s;ome of the moveables belonging to the holy Virgin, with parts of her apparel; the &s;poon and pap-di&s;h of the holy child; the head of &s;ome renowned &s;aint of St. Genevieve's acquaintance; the bones of the patrone&s;s of Paris her&s;elf, with her linen, and other property found in her

The figures engraved on this &s;acred uten&s;il were &s;ingular enough for a &s;aint.

In this madne&s;s again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition &s;ome method was ob&s;erved.

When the laws of war according to the regulations of civilized

<P>If &s;uch are the evils attendant on war when men murder each other without provocation and without re&s;entment; when they &s;carcely know either the cau&s;e of the di&s;pute which brought them into the field, or for whom they are going to &s;hed their blood; what mu&s;t be the hor|ror of that conflict where every regula|tion of humanity is con&s;idered as con|&s;piracy and trea&s;on, where every action becomes laudable in proportion as it be|comes ferocious, where murder is the

<P>The progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts after the events of the 10th of Augu&s;t to the epocha of Dumourier's defection, had remain|ed unnoticed; nor was it till they had rai&s;ed a mo&s;t formidable camp and me|naced Nantes, Angers, and other cities, and i&s;&s;ued their formal manife&s;toes de|manding the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the prie&s;t|hood, nobility, and royalty, that any effective mea&s;ures were taken to repre&s;s them. The fir&s;t generals that were &s;ent again&s;t them, who were Berruyer, Marie, and Ligonier, acted, it is &s;aid, as if they were their allies, rather than their ene|mies; and Quetinau, who &s;ucceeded them, is accu&s;ed of having &s;urrendered Touars, with the magazines which it contained, and an army of four thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The&s;e defections on the one &s;ide, and the victories of the royali&s;ts on the other, at length rou&s;ed the convention, who
<PB N="197" REF="207">
decreed that an army of three hundred thou&s;and men &s;hould be rai&s;ed to &s;uc|cour what they called the patriots in the Vend&eacute;e, who were oppo&s;ed by the robbers. As this &s;eemed to be an ex|tra-&s;ervice, great rewards were given to tho&s;e who would enli&s;t to go and a&s;&s;i&s;t "their brethren;" but mo&s;t of the&s;e heroes, who were paid enormous &s;ums to perform this act of charity, went and increa&s;ed the armies of the malcontents, in&s;tead of fighting again&s;t them. A &s;hort time after the 31&s;t of May, Saumur was taken by the royali&s;ts, and a number of other important places, Vehiers, Parte|nay, Bre&s;&s;uire, and Fontenay the capital of the department, fell into their power. The armies of the convention fled con|tinually before numbers greatly inferior, and abandoned their magazines, baggage, and cannon; &s;o that the Vend&eacute;an troops were furni&s;hed completely with &s;tores of every kind from the cowardice of the
<PB N="198" REF="208">
conventional forces, or the treachery of their commanders. While the&s;e di&s;|graces befel the armies on the we&s;tern &s;ide, Nantes, which was be&s;ieged by an army of forty thou&s;and men, was de|fended with five thou&s;and, by Canclaux, who by the prudence and vigour of his operations &s;aved the province of Brit|tany, and gained &s;everal important vic|tories.

<P>The royali&s;ts, encouraged by their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, and finding them&s;elves &s;o well &s;e|conded by the&s;e generals, marched on the 27th of July towards Angers, and to a bridge which was an important pa&s;s,

But con|trary mea&s;ures being taken by a deputy in mi&s;&s;ion, and other di&s;po&s;itions being made by general Tune, both places were &s;aved, and for the fir&s;t time a vic|tory was obtained.

<P>The evacuation of Cholet by the roy|ali&s;ts would have been the con&s;equence of their defeat; but when general Rey was propo&s;ing to take advantage of his victory, an imperial edict of the &s;ame &s;an&s;culotte general forced him to a re|treat. As a reward for &s;ucce&s;&s;es which Rey afterwards gained, he al&s;o was broke; and his adjutant, who came to Paris to plead for him, was thrown into the dun|geon of the Conciergerie.</P>
<P>The&s;e plans of military operations were not likely to be attended with much

&s;ucce&s;s, and have appeared at all times my&s;terious. Phillipeaux, in his &s;tric|tures on this war, calls it a &s;trange phe|nomenon for hi&s;tory, that the govern|ment &s;hould have looked calmly on, whil&s;t tho&s;e who gained victories were di&s;graced, and tho&s;e who&s;e only prowe&s;s had con&s;i&s;ted in converting whole ar|mies compo&s;ed of &s;ome of the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops in the re|public, into heaps of carca&s;&s;es, were care&s;&s;ed and continued in command.

<P>But time reveals mo&s;t my&s;teries. At this period the con&s;pirators in Paris were more in dread of the re&s;entment of the departments than they were of the arms of the royali&s;ts. Of the various calum|nies which they invented again&s;t the de|puties
<PB N="202" REF="212">
who had fled from Paris, that of joining the royali&s;ts was the mo&s;t indu&s;|triou&s;ly propagated; and while the pro|&s;cribed deputies were held up to the pub|lic as the &s;upporters and actors in a cau&s;e which all parties agreed to call rebellion, the con&s;pirators found them&s;elves ju&s;ti|fied in taking the mea&s;ures be&s;t fitted to exterminate the only rivals they had to dread. Had the royali&s;ts been defeated, and the rebellion cru&s;hed, the calumny would have been di&s;covered, and all pretence for puni&s;hment taken away. It was the intere&s;t therefore of the u&s;urp|ers to menace the people with the venge|ance of royali&s;m and federali&s;m united; and none were better calculated to fulfil their intentions, than tho&s;e inexperienced and profligate men who had the mo&s;t remarkable talents for procuring the de|feat of the armies they commanded.</P>
<P>Whether or no this be the real expla|nation of that which has been deemed &s;o
<PB N="203" REF="213">
my&s;terious, mu&s;t be left to the con&s;idera|tion of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to penetrate into this labyrinth. When we &s;ee the hi&s;tory of the war of the Vend&eacute;e written by the royali&s;ts them&s;elves, it is probable that they will &s;ay, that their own valour, and the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e in which they were engaged, gave them the&s;e victories. In yielding its full force to this expla|nation, and &s;uppo&s;ing that the conven|tional armies were defeated by braver troops, it will yet remain unexplained, why, of two cla&s;&s;es of conventional ge|nerals, tho&s;e who beat and tho&s;e who were beaten, the former &s;hould have found either impri&s;onment, or the &s;caf|fold, and the others prodigality of fa|vours.</P>
<P>The u&s;urpers having &s;ucceeded in their criminal de&s;igns again&s;t the republican party, now found it nece&s;&s;ary to rid them&s;elves of the royali&s;ts, whom they had hitherto made u&s;eful to their de&s;igns.
<PB N="204" REF="214">
The latter end of Augu&s;t they formed a different plan for the remainder of the campaign, which con&s;i&s;ted in attacking at once the royali&s;ts from every point, and fini&s;hing the conte&s;t as it were at a &s;ingle blow. The army on the northern &s;ide was committed to Ro&s;&s;ignol and Ron&s;in, and the revolutionary legions and the army on the we&s;tern coa&s;t were entru&s;ted to Lechelle. However well this plan might have been combined, the fir&s;t &s;pecimen tho&s;e who were to ex|ecute it gave of obedience to their in|&s;tructions was to &s;uffer the in&s;urgents to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Noir|moutier, Machecoul, and other places, and evacuate Montaigu, where they abandoned immen&s;e magazines of every &s;ort, and the army was reduced to &s;leep in the open air; while their ignorant or treacherous leaders kept at a convenient di&s;tance, &s;urrounded by actre&s;&s;es, cour|te&s;ans, and all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of an
<PB N="205" REF="215">
ea&s;tern camp, with all the vulgarity of the lowe&s;t profligacy.</P>
<P>This defeat was followed by many others, and by the capture al&s;o of &s;everal towns. The expedition which Lechelle made was &s;o contrived, that his troops had not the means of effecting a retreat. The protection of the city of Nantes was entru&s;ted to him, and he &s;uffered a body of &s;ome hundred royali&s;ts to cut off its provi&s;ions for &s;everal days in the face of his whole army; and when the repre|&s;entatives of the people reque&s;ted him to &s;end a detachment to re&s;cue a convoy of flour which had fallen into the enemy's hands, he treated the application with contempt.</P>
<P>While this general was di&s;po&s;ing of the conventional armies on the we&s;tern &s;ide, his colleagues Ro&s;&s;ignol and Ron|&s;in, the latter of whom having &s;een &s;ome &s;ervice took the title of <HI>mini&s;ter-general,</HI> were preparing to execute the plan of
<PB N="206" REF="216">
the campaign on the other &s;ide. In&s;tead of marching to attack the enemy, they halted for &s;ome time at Saumur and Tours, &s;o as to let the royali&s;t army ac|quire its proper con&s;i&s;tency. To &s;ur|round the enemy was the great object; and orders were &s;ent to the commanders of the &s;outhern armies at Niort, Lucon, and Partenay, to co-operate. The event of this arrangement was, conformably to the ordinary &s;y&s;tem, the total defeat of the&s;e divi&s;ions; and on the 18th of Sep|tember &s;o admirably were the in&s;truc|tions obeyed, that fifty thou&s;and men at Coran and near the pa&s;&s;age of the Loire at C&eacute;, commanded by Ron&s;in and Ro&s;|&s;ignol, were attacked by an army con|&s;i&s;ting of three thou&s;and royali&s;ts only; and what could appear &s;carcely credible, the <HI>&s;an&s;culotte</HI> generals had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly arranged their troops, that they were not only defeated by this incon&s;idera|ble detachment, but the &s;laughter was immen&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="217">
This extraordinary defeat will not, I am told, &s;urpri&s;e any military man, when he hears that the conventional army was arranged for battle in a &s;ingle column, in the defiles of Coran, with eight men in front, and pre&s;enting a flank to the enemy, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, of nearly twelve miles in extent. The artillery, in&s;tead of being placed on tho&s;e heights, under the protection of a &s;trong detachment, as was propo&s;ed by the guides, and tho&s;e who knew the country, was placed at the head of this long co|lumn, and of cour&s;e fell into the hands of the royali&s;ts, who turned it again&s;t the conventional troops, and made great carnage. In the mean time, detachments of the enemy gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights without difficulty and without re&s;i&s;tance, ma&s;&s;acred the troops below, taking them in flank, and made them, from the confu&s;ion into which they were thrown, the exterminators of each other.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="218">
The generals who commanded this ex|pedition were, in the mean time, regaling them&s;elves at a di&s;tance, with their mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, &s;ome of whom were afterwards godde&s;&s;es of rea&s;on; but they had the prudence to de&s;troy their magazines, in|&s;tead of leaving them as u&s;ual at the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy. The harve&s;t of that part of the country was ju&s;t then gathered in, and would have &s;ufficed them for a whole year, had they &s;e|cured it agreeably to the orders of the convention.</P>
<P>This new plan of a campaign was not attended with more happy &s;ucce&s;s than the former, and the my&s;tery which em|barra&s;&s;ed Phillipeaux became &s;till more inexplicable. It would be difficult in|deed to define what could be the motive which led the government to look with &s;o much complacency on this continued &s;y&s;tem of defeat and carnage, did we not &s;ee what combinations of crooked policy
<PB N="209" REF="219">
were put into execution to &s;ecure the purpo&s;es of ferocious ambition. The party of the Gironde, being completely cru&s;hed, gave them no longer any in|quietude, and it became now the intere&s;t of the u&s;urpers to bring the war to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue. The two former plans not having &s;ucceeded, the committee of pub|lic &s;afety publi&s;hed another. The&s;e con|&s;pirators had &s;een how efficacious their decrees had been in &s;everal in&s;tances, and therefore imagined a mode of putting an end to this de&s;tructive conte&s;t by decree|ing that it &s;hould fini&s;h on the 20th of October, and that the generals &s;hould receive the triumphal crown on the fir&s;t of November following. We &s;hould be inclined to &s;mile at this exce&s;s of folly, if that di&s;po&s;ition were not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by indignation and horror at the atrocious orders which were given for this purpo&s;e to their armies, "that de&s;olation and in|di&s;criminate

<P>The decree having &s;tated in expre&s;s terms, "that all the retreats, mills, and ovens of the robbers &s;hould be de&s;troyed and burnt, and that the mini&s;ter of war &s;hould be ordered to &s;end combu&s;tible matter for that purpo&s;e;" and the pro|clamation of the convention having in|vited the &s;oldiers of liberty to exterminate all the&s;e robbers, before the end of Octo|ber; "the &s;oldiers of liberty," and all tho&s;e who were invited to the accom|pli&s;hment of this new plan of the cam|paign, prepared to put it into execution. Neither the committee of u&s;urpation, nor the convention had been nice in the de|finition of their terms, and therefore the &s;oldiers of liberty undertook to con&s;true them at their plea&s;ure. Accordingly, every hou&s;e of the peaceful inhabitant came within the definition of the retreat of a robber, &s;ince every inhabitant of the
<PB N="211" REF="221">
Vend&eacute;e was con&s;idered as a robber, and con&s;equently his dwelling mu&s;t be a re|treat.</P>
<P>Whether or no the in&s;truments of this barbarous and execrable policy rea&s;oned after this manner, they certainly became practical logicians; and the army, in ad|dition to their hundred thou&s;and bay|onets, were armed with a hundred thou|&s;and torches; and having been pronounced by the u&s;urpers the executors of their ju&s;t vengeance, the property of the armed royali&s;t and the peaceable republican became alike objects of their rapacity and fury; and indi&s;criminate ma&s;&s;acre and plunder were literally the order of the day.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t days of the revolution, when liberty and philo&s;ophy went hand in hand together, what a moral revolution was in&s;tantly effected throughout Europe, by the &s;ublime and immortal principles which this great change &s;eemed about to introduce into government! But what

<P>AFTER the &s;iege of Peru&s;ia, &s;ay the hi&s;torians, in &s;pite of the capitulation, the an&s;wer of Augu&s;tus was: "You mu&s;t all peri&s;h." Three hundred of the principal citizens were dragged to the altar of Ju|lius Cae&s;ar, and there on the day of the ides of March were murdered: after which the remainder of the inhabitants were put without di&s;tinction to the edge of the &s;word; and the city, which was one of the fine&s;t in Italy, was reduced to a&s;hes, and as much effaced as Hercula|neum from the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>There was formerly a law in Rome, &s;ays Tacitus, which defined &s;tate crimes and

high trea&s;ons, and which decreed the puni&s;hment of pain of death. The&s;e crimes of high trea&s;on, under the repub|lic, were reduced to four &s;orts: namely, if an army had been abandoned in an enemy's country; if &s;edition had been ex|cited; if the members of the con&s;tituted bodies had mi&s;managed public affairs, or mi&s;applied the public money; and if the maje&s;ty of the Roman people had been degraded. The emperors wanted but a few additional articles to this law to in|volve both the citizens and whole ci|ties in a general pro&s;cription. Augu&s;tus was the fir&s;t to extend this law of high trea&s;on, in which he comprehended writ|ings which he called <HI>counter-revolutionary.</HI> Under his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the exten&s;ion of this law became unbounded.

<P>If, on the contrary, a citizen amu&s;es him&s;elf and lives luxuriou&s;ly; he is merry only becau&s;e the emperor has had an at|tack of the gout, which happily is nothing: we mu&s;t &s;hew this gentleman that his maje&s;ty is in the prime of life.

<PB N="223" REF="233">
to have a great place, or re&s;ign it; but the greate&s;t of all crimes was to be incorrup|tible. Nero had &s;o thoroughly extir|pated all good and virtuous men, that after having got rid of Thra&s;ea and Soranes, he boa&s;ted that he had aboli&s;hed even the name of Virtue from the earth. When the &s;enate had condemned them, the em|peror wrote a letter of thanks for their having put to death enemies of the repub|lic. The tribune Clodius erected an altar to Liberty in the place where Cicero's hou&s;e had been ra&s;ed to the ground, and the people &s;houted, "Vive la Libert&eacute;!"</P>
<P>One was executed on account of his name, or that of his ance&s;tors, and an|other on account of a beautiful hou&s;e at Alba. Valerius A&s;iaticus, becau&s;e the empre&s;s was plea&s;ed with his gardens; Statilius, becau&s;e &s;he did not like the cut of his face; and a numerous multitude without any rea&s;on whatever.</P>

<P>In one word, under three reigns the na|tural death of a celebrated man was &s;o rare a thing, that it was put into the gazette as a &s;ort of epocha, and tran&s;|mitted by hi&s;torians to the remembrance of ages. "Under this con&s;ulate," &s;ays our annali&s;t, "the pontiff Pi&s;o died in his bed, which appeared &s;omewhat mi|raculous."</P>
<P>The death of &s;o many excellent citizens appeared a le&s;s calamity than the in&s;o|lence
<PB N="225" REF="235">
and &s;candalous fortunes of their murderers and den unciators. Every day the &s;acred and inviolable informer made his triumphant entry into the palaces of the dead, and &s;eized on &s;ome rich inherit|ance. All the&s;e denunciators a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t re&s;pectable names, and called them&s;elves Cotta, Scipio, Regulus, Ca&s;|&s;ius, Severus. Denunciation was the only means of arriving at honours, and Re|gulus was made con&s;ul three times on ac|count of his informations.</P>
<P>In this manner every one threw him&s;elf in the way of arriving at dignities, &s;ince the road was &s;o ea&s;y; and the <HI>marquis</HI> Serenus, in order to make his fir&s;t appear|ance with <HI>&eacute;clat,</HI> and gain reputation as an informer, began a pro&s;ecution again&s;t his aged father as a <HI>counter-revolutioni&s;t</HI>; after which he decorated him&s;elf with the &s;ounding name of Brutus.</P>
<P>The judges re&s;embled the accu&s;ers:
<PB N="226" REF="236">
the tribunals, which ought to have been the protectors of life and property, were become butcheries; and robbery and murder bore the names of confi&s;cation and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If there were no means of &s;ending a man to the tribunal, he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated or im|pri&s;oned. Celer Aelius, the famous Locu&s;|ta, the phy&s;ician Anicetus, were poi&s;oners by profe&s;&s;ion, privileged men, travelling in the &s;uite of the court, and a kind of lords of the bed-chamber to the crown. When the&s;e half-mea&s;ures were not found &s;ufficient, the tyrant had recour&s;e to a ge|neral pro&s;cription. Thus it was that Cara|calla declared all his friends and the par|ti&s;ans of Sejanus enemies of the republic, to the number of thirty thou&s;and. Thus it was that Sylla in one day forbade the u&s;e of fire and water to &s;eventy thou&s;and Romans. If a lion-emperor had a prae|torian guard of tigers and panthers, they
<PB N="227" REF="237">
would not have torn in pieces a greater number than the common informers, the freedmen, the poi&s;oners, and the cut|throats of the Cae&s;ars; for the cruelty cau&s;ed by hunger cea&s;es with hunger, while that cau&s;ed by fear, by the avarice and the &s;u&s;picions of tyrants has no bounds. To what a degree of degra|dation and ba&s;ene&s;s mu&s;t not the hu|man race have fallen, when we think that Rome &s;uffered the government of a mon&s;ter, who complained that his reign had not been &s;ignalized by any calamity, pe&s;tilence, famine, or earthquake; who envied Augu&s;tus the happine&s;s of hav|ing had under his empire an army cut to pieces, and in the reign of Tiberius the di&s;a&s;ter of the amphitheatre of Fi|denae, where fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons pe|ri&s;hed; and to &s;um up all in one word, who wi&s;hed that the Roman people had but one neck, to put it <HI>in ma&s;s</HI> through <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cant word for the guillotine.</NOTE> the little window!"</P>

<P>It is all over, my poor Delphina: for the la&s;t time I embrace you! I cannot &s;ee you, and even if I could I would not.

<P>"THE &s;ituation of affairs, and the di&s;contented &s;tate of the public mind, alarmed the court. The mini&s;ters &s;oon became the object of general animadver|&s;ion, and their conduct did not appear at all favourable to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution, which the king had &s;worn to maintain contrary to his will and feelings, and which he was deter|mined not to &s;upport. Amid&s;t the fre|quent changes and confu&s;ion which then took place in admini&s;tration, the court was puzzled and doubtful of whom to make choice. It was &s;aid openly and loudly, that, if the king was &s;incere, he would choo&s;e his mini&s;ters among&s;t men who&s;e reputation for patrioti&s;m was not doubtful. The king had hitherto de|cided as cowardice or fear dictated; &s;ome|times with the hopes of gaining over tho&s;e who were named, or with the re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="233" REF="243">
if this plan did not &s;ucceed, of driving them altogether from the court. At length the king &s;eemed determined to choo&s;e his mini&s;ters among&s;t tho&s;e who were called patriots, for then the appel|lation was not di&s;honoured. How that came to pa&s;s I never have been informed. Intelligent men reflected how important it was to direct the choice of the court towards men of talents and of re&s;pectable character; for it was po&s;&s;ible that it might have taken a malignant plea&s;ure in making a &s;election of a &s;et of wrong|headed Jacobins, who&s;e blunders and exaggerations would have ju&s;tified com|plaints, and brought di&s;grace on the whole body of patriots. I do not know who it was that in the committee of the Place Vend&ocirc;me named Roland as one of tho&s;e who ought to be cho&s;en; but his name was connected with the idea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The committee of the Place Vend&ocirc;me was an a&s;&s;embly of patriot deputies, who met at the hou&s;e of one of their colleagues for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public affairs.</NOTE> of a
<PB N="234" REF="244">
man well informed, who had written on &s;everal branches of admini&s;tration, who had experience in the&s;e affairs, who be|&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable degree of reputation, and who&s;e principles unequi|vocally expre&s;&s;ed in his writings, even before the revolution, di&s;covered him to be a warm parti&s;an of liberty, being &s;o in all re&s;pects. The king was not a &s;tranger to the&s;e con&s;iderations, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to prove.</P>
<P>This project was communicated to us only three days before the new mini&s;try was formed. Bri&s;&s;ot came to me one evening when I was alone, and told me that Roland was thought of as mini&s;ter. I &s;miled, and a&s;ked him what he meant by his plea&s;antry? He an&s;wered me, that he was in earne&s;t, informed me of what
<PB N="235" REF="245">
I have ju&s;t related, and added, that he was come to know if Roland would un|dertake the charge. I promi&s;ed to &s;peak to Roland on the &s;ubject, and give him an an&s;wer the next day. Roland was as much a&s;toni&s;hed as my&s;elf at the event. A multiplicity of affairs to one of his active mind was no cau&s;e of objection; and he told me, that as he had always ob&s;erved placemen to be beings of a very middling rank with re&s;pect to talents, and yet public bu&s;ine&s;s went forward, he was not him&s;elf afraid of the undertak|ing; that the &s;ituation was indeed criti|cal, on account of the di&s;tinct intere&s;t of the court and the uncertainty of the king's intentions; but that whoever at|tended only to his duty, and was carele&s;s about the lo&s;s of his place in executing it, had nothing to fear: be&s;ides which, a zealous man, who was con&s;cientious in the means he made u&s;e of, could not be without hope of being of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice
<PB N="236" REF="246">
to his country. Roland therefore deter|mined to accept the office, and made known his intentions to Bri&s;&s;ot, who came the next evening at eleven o'clock at the breaking up of the council, ac|companied by Dumourier, who an|nounced to him officially that the king had ju&s;t made choice of him as mini&s;ter for home-affairs. Dumourier, who had been mini&s;ter for &s;ome little time, &s;poke of the king's &s;incere di&s;po&s;itions to &s;up|port the con&s;titution, and of his hopes of &s;eeing the machine go on with &s;ucce&s;s, when the whole of the council &s;hould be animated by the &s;ame &s;pirit: he te&s;tified al&s;o to Roland his particular &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing &s;o virtuous and enlightened a patriot named to the admini&s;tration of government.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot ob&s;erved that the department for home-affairs was the mo&s;t delicate and the mo&s;t intricate of all, and that it was a con&s;olation to the friends of liberty
<PB N="237" REF="247">
to &s;ee it entru&s;ted to pure and firm hands. The conver&s;ation turned &s;lightly on the&s;e heads, and the hour was fixed on for Roland the next day to be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, to take the oath, and his &s;eat at the council.</P>
<P>I found in Dumourier the manly air of a &s;oldier, the addre&s;s of an able cour|tier, the &s;tyle of a man of wit, but no trace of truth. In comparing this man with his new colleague, who&s;e au&s;terity and frankne&s;s &s;ometimes border on rude|ne&s;s, I a&s;ked my&s;elf if they were made to go on long together? "Here is a man," &s;aid Roland, after their departure, "who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es talents." "Yes," replied I, "and again&s;t which you mu&s;t be on your guard; for I think him capable of ca&s;ting you all off, if you do not keep to his pace: we &s;hall &s;ee." The fir&s;t time Roland appeared at court in his ordinary &s;imple dre&s;s, which he had for a long time worn for the &s;ake of convenience, a few
<PB N="238" REF="248">
&s;cattered hairs, combed over his venerable head, a round hat, and his &s;hoes tied with &s;trings, tho&s;e valets of the court who placed the highe&s;t importance in the etiquette on which their own exi&s;tence depends, looked at him with di&s;dain, and with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment. One of them approached Dumourier, and, knitting his brows, whi&s;pered him, while he pointed out with his eyes the object of his &s;ur|pri&s;e, "Sir! &s;ir! . . . . . no buckles in his &s;hoes!" Dumourier, putting on an air of affected gravity, exclaimed, "Ay, &s;ir, it is all over, we are all ruined." The &s;tory went round, and tho&s;e laughed at it who had the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to be diverted.</P>
<P>Lewis XVI. behaved to his mini&s;try with the greate&s;t good-humour. This man was not preci&s;ely &s;uch a per&s;onage as he has been indu&s;triou&s;ly repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in degrading him. He was neither that &s;tupid &s;ot
<PB N="239" REF="249">
which he has been held out to be for the purpo&s;e of exciting contempt, nor that polite, good and affectionate cha|racter for which his friends have extolled him. Nature had formed him in a common kind of mould: he would have acted well in an ob&s;cure &s;ituation; but he was depraved by a royal education, and lo&s;t his moderation at a critical period, in which his &s;afety could have been effected only by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of genius or virtue. A common mind, educated at court, and taught from the cradle the art of di&s;&s;embling, acquires many advantages in its commerce with mankind. The art of di&s;covering to each no more than he would wi&s;h him to know, is only a habit, to which con&s;tant exerci&s;e gives the appearance of addre&s;s; and a man mu&s;t be born an ideot, in order to appear a fool in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion. Lewis XVI. had be&s;ides a good memory, and a great &s;hare of activity;
<PB N="240" REF="250">
he never was a moment unemployed, and read a good deal. He had the mo&s;t perfect and minute knowledge of all the treaties made by France with the neigh|bouring powers; he was well acquainted with its hi&s;tory, and was the be&s;t geogra|pher in his kingdom. Knowledge of names; the ju&s;t application of them to the phy&s;i|ognomies of the per&s;ons of the court to whom they belonged; acquaintance with all their private anecdotes, had been extend|ed by him to every individual, who had at all di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the revolution; and no one of any quality or de&s;cription could be mentioned to him, of whom he could not give &s;ome kind of information founded on their private hi&s;tory. But Lewis XVI. without &s;trength of character, was confined in his views, and had twi&s;ted as it were his feelings by &s;uper&s;titious pre|judices and je&s;uitical principles. The great ideas of religion, the belief of a God, and the a&s;&s;urance of immortality,
<PB N="241" REF="251">
are perfectly in harmony with philo&s;ophy; and while they rear its column on tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;olid of all foundations, they like|wi&s;e adorn it with the mo&s;t fini&s;hed ca|pital. Wretched are the legi&s;lators who de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e powerful means of in&s;piring political virtues, and of forming the morals of a nation. If they were even illu&s;ions, we ought to cheri&s;h them, for the con&s;olation of mankind: but the re|ligion of our prie&s;ts pre&s;ented us only with objects of childi&s;h fear, and mi&s;er|able mummeries, in&s;tead of good works; and al&s;o con&s;ecrated the whole code of de&s;poti&s;m, on which the authority of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church is founded. Lewis XVI. was literally afraid of hell, the horns and hoofs of the devil, and excom|munication; and with all this it was im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be any thing but a poor creature of a king. If he had been born two hundred years earlier, and had
<PB N="242" REF="252">
had a rea&s;onable wife, he would have made no more noi&s;e in the world than other princes of his line, who have pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s the &s;tage without doing either much good or evil: but a&s;cending the throne amid&s;t the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of the court of Lewis XV. and the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the trea&s;ury, and &s;urrounded by corrupted men, he was drawn on by a giddy woman, who joined to Au&s;trian in&s;olence the for|wardne&s;s of youth, and to the arrogance of grandeur the intoxication of the &s;en&s;es, and the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of levity; and who was her&s;elf &s;educed by all the vices of an A&s;iatic court. Lewis XVI. too weak to hold the reins of government, which was now falling headlong into ruin, and crumbling to de&s;olation, ha&s;tened his own by faults without number. Neckar, who always acted the pathetic in politics as well as in writing; a man of moderate abilities, but of which the world entertained a
<PB N="243" REF="253">
high opinion, becau&s;e he had formed a high opinion of them him&s;elf, which he was careful to make known; without fore&s;ight; a &s;ort of a retail financier, who could only calculate the contents of a pur&s;e, and was talking continually of his reputation, as women of intrigue talk of their cha&s;tity; Neckar was but a &s;orry pilot for the &s;torm that was gather|ing. France was, as it were, exhau&s;ted of men: it is a thing highly &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould have been &s;o &s;carce in this revolution: it has brought forth &s;carcely any but pigmies. It is not be|cau&s;e there was any want of wit, of in|formation, of knowledge, of philo&s;ophy: the&s;e ingredients had never been more common: it was the blaze of the torch ju&s;t expiring. But that energy of &s;oul which J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau has &s;o admirably defined as the fir&s;t characteri&s;tic of the hero, &s;upported by that &s;olidity of judg|ment which knows the ju&s;t value of
<PB N="244" REF="254">
every thing; with that fore&s;ight which penetrates into futurity, the re-union of which con&s;titutes character, and forms the &s;uperior man, we have looked for it every where, but it has been no where to be found.</P>
<P>Lewis XVI. continually floating be|tween the fear of irritating his &s;ubjects, and his wi&s;h to keep them within bounds, and unable to govern them, convened the &s;tates-general, in&s;tead of reforming the expences, and regulating his court. After having him&s;elf unveiled the &s;pring, and &s;hewed the way to innovation, he hoped to &s;top its progre&s;s, by affecting a power again&s;t which he had furni&s;hed arms, and again&s;t which he had him&s;elf given in&s;tructions for re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>No other means were left him, than to &s;acrifice with a good grace a part of his authority, in order, by means of the other, to &s;eize the whole, on a proper occa&s;ion, which he was not however likely
<PB N="245" REF="255">
to do; &s;ince he gave him&s;elf up to the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;ort of intrigues, the only &s;ort familiar to tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e for his advi&s;ers, under the protection and patronage of his wife. He had certainly pre&s;erved under the con&s;titution &s;ufficient means both of power and of happine&s;s, if he had had the wi&s;dom to keep him&s;elf within bounds. Want of ability had di&s;|abled him from preventing the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the new government; but hone&s;ty alone would have been &s;ufficient to have &s;aved him, if he had been &s;incere in execut|ing, when he had accepted the con&s;titution. Unhappily for him&s;elf, on one hand to &s;upport what he was overthrowing with the other, was his crooked policy; and this perfidious conduct fir&s;t excited mi&s;|tru&s;t, and then fini&s;hed by kindling ge|neral indignation.</P>
<P>When he had made choice of pa|triotic mini&s;ters, he was particularly anxious to in&s;pire them with confidence;
<PB N="246" REF="256">
and he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that for three weeks, I &s;aw Roland and Clavieres, en|chanted with the king's di&s;po&s;itions, thinking only of the happy order of things, and flattering them&s;elves that the revolution was fini&s;hed.&mdash;"Good God!" I &s;aid to them, "every time I &s;ee you come from the council with this great confidence, I always think that you are about to commit &s;ome act of great folly." "I a&s;&s;ure you," an&s;wered Clavieres, "that the king is perfectly convinced that his intere&s;t is intimately connected with the ob&s;ervance of the laws which have been ju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed: he rea&s;ons about them too feelingly not to have a perfect conviction of this truth." "If," added Roland, "he be not an hone&s;t man, he is the mo&s;t arrant cheat in the kingdom: di&s;&s;imulation can hardly go &s;o far." "And for my part," I replied, "I have no great confidence in any man's regard for the con&s;titution, who has been
<PB N="247" REF="257">
educated in the prejudices of de&s;poti&s;m and habits of di&s;&s;ipation, and who&s;e con|duct latterly has exhibited a total want both of genius and virtue. Lewis XVI. mu&s;t be a man very much above the common &s;tandard, to have any &s;incere regard for a con&s;titution which narrows the limits of his power; and if he had been &s;uch a man, he would not have &s;uffered tho&s;e events to have taken place which have brought about this con&s;titu|tion." My great argument for his in|&s;incerity was founded on his flight to Varennes.</P>
<P>There was a council four times a week. The mini&s;ters agreed to dine to|gether at each other's hou&s;es by turns every council day. I received them on Fridays. De Grave was the mini&s;ter of war. He was a &s;light man in all re&s;pects; nature had made him mild and timid; his prejudices would have made him haughty, but his heart forced him to be gentle;
<PB N="248" REF="258">
and from his embarra&s;&s;ment to reconcile the&s;e different parts of his character, he became in reality nothing. I think I &s;ee him marching with his courtier-like air, his head quite aloft from his feeble frame, &s;hewing the white of his blue eyes, which he could &s;carcely keep open after dinner, without the help of two or three cups of coffee; &s;peaking but little, as if he had been re&s;erved, but which &s;ilence proceeded only from penury of ideas: in fine, he was &s;o bewildered amid&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of his department, that he a&s;ked leave to retire. Laco&s;te was a true clerk of office under the old &s;y&s;tem, with an in&s;ignificant mien, a cold look, and a dramatical tone, with talents for the ordinary run of affairs: but his formal phy&s;iognomy concealed a violence of character which, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions where he met with contradiction, made him ridiculous: he had no comprehen&s;ive views, nor the activity nece&s;&s;ary for a
<PB N="249" REF="259">
mini&s;ter. Duranthon, who had been brought up from Bourdeaux to be mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, was hone&s;t, as they &s;ay, but very indolent: he had an air of vanity, and always appeared to me an old woman, from his timorous character and his con&s;equential babble. Clavieres was appointed mini&s;ter of finance, from the reputation he had gained for his know|ledge in that branch, but of which I am no judge. He was laborious and active, ira&s;cible and ob&s;tinate, as tho&s;e men generally are who live confined to their de&s;ks; punctilious and difficult in his di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and often in contradiction with Roland: the&s;e two men e&s;teemed without ever loving each other, but never di&s;agreed in the great leading prin|ciples of their duties.</P>
<P>Dumourier had a greater &s;hare than any of the&s;e in what is called wit, and le&s;s of morality. Diligent and brave, a good general, a thorough-paced courtier,
<PB N="250" REF="260">
a good writer, a ready &s;peaker, and ca|pable of great undertakings; he was de|ficient only in firmne&s;s of character, and wanted a cooler head to execute the plans he had conceived: good humoured with his friends, and ready to cheat every one of them; a&s;&s;iduous to the ladies, but no way fitted to &s;ucceed with tho&s;e who were to be won only by tenderne&s;s; he was altogether formed for the mini&s;terial intrigues of a corrupted court. His &s;plen|did qualities; and his love of glory led us to think that he might be u&s;efully em|ployed in the armies of the republic; and perhaps he would have acted well if the convention had acted wi&s;ely; for he had too much good &s;en&s;e not to behave as an hone&s;t man, when his reputation and his intere&s;t were &s;o intimately concerned.</P>
<P>At this time De Grave was about to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The mini&s;ters and the pa|triot deputies were at a lo&s;s on whom to fix for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ince the military
<PB N="251" REF="261">
men who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves were almo&s;t all of them ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution. Roland thought of Ser|van, who had been long in the &s;ervice, and had obtained the cro&s;s of St. Lewis; and who&s;e principles were not equivocal, &s;ince he had publi&s;hed them previou&s;ly to the revolution in an excellent work call|ed "The &s;oldier a citizen." We knew him per&s;onally from having &s;een him at Lyons, where he had the de&s;erved repu|tation of a wi&s;e and indu&s;trious man; and where he retired after having lo&s;t his place at court as governor of the pages, his politics not being &s;uitable either to tho&s;e of M. St. Prie&s;t, or the palace.</P>
<P>Servan is an upright man in the full extent of the term, of an ardent mind, pure morals, with all the au&s;terity of a philo&s;opher, and all the goodne&s;s of an affectionate heart; an enlightened patriot, a brave &s;oldier, a vigilant mini&s;ter: he wanted only perhaps a little more cool|ne&s;s
<PB N="252" REF="262">
of temper, and more energy of cha|racter; but he had a degree of merit rare to find, and we &s;hould have been too happy to have had many men of this &s;tamp.</P>
<P>The &s;ittings of the council might be called decent in compari&s;on with what they became afterwards; but they were at that time puerile, con&s;idering the great intere&s;ts which were at &s;take. Each of the mini&s;ters who had <HI>bons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bons</HI> are orders for certain operations, mo&s;t commonly for the delivery of money.</NOTE> to &s;ign, or other papers belonging to his office, went to the king on the council day to arrange this particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s before the council began. They all went afterwards into the council-hall; where, after the decrees had been &s;igned, which the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice pre&s;ented, debates took place re&s;pecting the opera|ations of government, internal order, re|lations with foreign powers, peace or
<PB N="253" REF="263">
war, &amp;c. With re&s;pect to the proclama|tions of the day, they had only to examine the decree and apply it, which was al|ways a &s;hort bu&s;ine&s;s. The king &s;uffered his mini&s;ters to talk: in the mean time he read the gazette, the Engli&s;h news|papers in their own language, or wrote letters. The &s;anction of the decrees, how|ever, fixed his attention: he did not give his &s;anction readily, but never refu&s;ed. When a decree was pre&s;ented for the fir&s;t time, he put off &s;anctioning it till the following council, when he came with his mind made up.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to objects of great po|litical concern, he often eluded examin|ing them, by turning the conver&s;ation on different &s;ubjects, or on matters pe|culiar to each of the mini&s;ters. If the bu&s;ine&s;s turned on war affairs, he talked about travels; if it was a diplomatic di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, he began a hi&s;tory of the man|ners of the country in que&s;tion, or made
<PB N="254" REF="264">
enquiries about its &s;ituation and produce; if the examination of the &s;tate affairs led him into details of agriculture and rural oeconomy, he que&s;tioned Roland about his works, talked to Dumourier about his anecdotes, and &s;o with the re&s;t. The council in &s;hort was little el&s;e than a cof|fee-hou&s;e, where every one learnt the news of the day, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with trifles: there was no regi&s;ter kept of the deliberations, no &s;ecretary to mi|nute them. After three or four hours conver&s;ation the council broke up, with|out having done any thing, except put|ting &s;ome &s;ignatures, and this took place three times a week. "But this is piti|ful!" I could not help exclaiming with &s;ome ill humour when, on Roland's re|turn, I a&s;ked him what had pa&s;&s;ed. "You are all of you too courteous, be|cau&s;e you meet with no oppo&s;ition, be|cau&s;e you are treated with affability and politene&s;s, becau&s;e you have the appear|ance
<PB N="255" REF="265">
of doing each of you in your re|&s;pective departments ju&s;t what you plea&s;e. I am much afraid that you will all be deceived."</P>
<P>"But neverthele&s;s," &s;ays Roland, "bu&s;ine&s;s goes on."&mdash;"Yes, but time is lo&s;t; for in the torrent of affairs that that is overwhelming you, I would ra|ther &s;ee you employ three hours in &s;oli|tary meditation on tho&s;e great combina|tions of events before you, than wa&s;te them in u&s;ele&s;s talk."</P>
<P>The enemy were now forming their plans, and it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to declare war; a mea&s;ure which brought on warm di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and which the king a&s;&s;ented to with extreme repug|nance: he had delayed the deci&s;ion as long as po&s;&s;ible, and appeared to yield only when he &s;aw that the majority of the a&s;&s;embly were of that opinion, and that his council was unanimous.</P>
<P>The continuance and multiplicity of
<PB N="256" REF="266">
religious troubles re&s;pecting which the mini&s;ter for home-affairs had continually but in vain &s;olicited him for &s;ome time pa&s;t to take &s;trong and repre&s;&s;ive mea|&s;ures, now compelled him to do &s;o. On the other hand, the bold &s;teps taken by the foreign troops being formidable and menacing, had given the mini&s;ter of war, Servan, an idea of a military pro|ject, which the a&s;&s;embly &s;eized on with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and in&s;tantly decreed.</P>
<P>It is very true that the&s;e two decrees, one for forming a camp of twenty thou|&s;and men between Paris and the fron|tiers, and the other re&s;pecting the prie&s;ts, were altogether deci&s;ive. The court be|held in the&s;e mea&s;ures the overthrow of its &s;ecret machinations, of all its plans of par|tial in&s;urrections, by the means of fana|tici&s;m, and the progre&s;s of the enemy towards Paris; both of which opera|tions it protected.</P>
<P>The king was too much decided in
<PB N="257" REF="267">
refu&s;ing his &s;anction to be very earne&s;t in declaring his determination. He made u&s;e of different pretences, by which means he avoided an explanation for fifteen days. A debate was begun &s;e|veral times on the&s;e two articles. Ro|land and Servan in&s;i&s;ted with warmth, and with great energy declared the mo&s;t &s;triking truths, becau&s;e each felt the importance and the nece&s;&s;ity of the law as it re&s;pected his particular province. The general intere&s;t of the affair was a thing evident to all of them, and the &s;ix mini&s;ters had but one opinion on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>During the&s;e di&s;putes, Dumourier, who was intimate with the king, and who&s;e morals were more in uni&s;on with tho&s;e of the court, was often a vi&s;itor of the queen; and as he was not in great harmony with his colleagues, the au&s;te|rity of who&s;e manners was a reproach to his own, he found &s;oon the means of
<PB N="258" REF="268">
getting rid of them, and entered into arrangements the effects of which were not long in being felt. A mi&s;under|&s;tanding, or rather a &s;erious di&s;pute had taken place between Dumourier and his colleagues, particularly Roland, re&s;pect|ing baron Carieve, whom Dumourier had made director-general of the foreign department. A report was &s;pread that the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and livres was paid to Madame de Beauvert, who lived with Dumourier as his mi&s;tre&s;s, and did the honours of his table, to the great &s;candal of tho&s;e who were connected with him. Dumourier received the re|pre&s;entations that were made to him by Roland, both with re&s;pect to his neglect of decency, and his attachment to this director-general, with ill-humour: he quit|ted the meeting of the patriotic deputies, and became vi&s;ibly cool towards Roland. "From this moment," continues Madame Roland, "he cea&s;ed holding any farther
<PB N="259" REF="269">
communication with the deputies, and became more re&s;erved towards his col|leagues; and no doubt began to medi|tate how he might mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly rid him&s;elf of tho&s;e who&s;e characters were lea&s;t in uni&s;on with his own. I fore&s;aw the effect of the&s;e conferences, and &s;aid to Ro|land; "If you were an intriguer, capa|ble of behaving according to the errors of the old court and its former &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hould &s;ay that the moment is come when you ought to get rid of Dumou|rier, to hinder him from playing you &s;ome trick. But hone&s;t men under|&s;tand nothing of the&s;e &s;ort of courtier|like &s;kirmi&s;hes, and Roland was as in|capable of having recour&s;e to them as he was unfitted to practi&s;e them.</P>
<P>The delay of the &s;anction was now under&s;tood as a po&s;itive veto, as the time was almo&s;t expired. We felt that the council not having courage and con&s;i&s;t|ence enough to pronounce their opini|ons
<PB N="260" REF="270">
<HI>in ma&s;s,</HI> it was Roland's duty, and what integrity and courage directed him, to &s;tep forward &s;ingly; and we determin|ed together on writing the well-known letter to the king. I compo&s;ed this let|ter my&s;elf, which was written without much meditation. He carried it to the council to read it aloud on the day when the king, who was &s;till urged re|&s;pecting his &s;anction, required the mini&s;|ters to give each of them his opinion written and &s;igned, and then went ra|pidly on to talk of other affairs. Roland returned home, added a few lines in the cover of the letter, and had it put into the king's hands on the morning of the 11th of June. The next day, the 12th, about eight o'clock, Servan called on us with a gay countenance, "Give me joy," &s;aid he, "I have had the honour to be turned out." "My hu&s;band," I re|plied, "will &s;oon &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and I am &s;omewhat picqued that you
<PB N="261" REF="271">
are the fir&s;t." He told us, that having gone that morning to the king for &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s, he had talked with him very warmly on the nece&s;&s;ity of the camp of twenty thou&s;and men, if he was real|ly in earne&s;t in oppo&s;ing the de&s;igns of the enemy; that the king had turned his back to him in very ill humour; and that Dumourier had ju&s;t left the war|office, where he had gone to take the &s;eals in con&s;equence of an order which he carried with him. "Dumourier! he plays a &s;orry part&mdash;but it does not &s;urpri&s;e me." The three preceding days he had often been at the Thuilleries in long conferences with the queen; and it is not ami&s;s to remark, that Baron Car|ri&eacute;ve had &s;ome intere&s;t through her wo|men. Roland hearing that Servan was with me, left the per&s;ons to whom he was giving audience, learned the news, and &s;ent to invite his colleagues, Dumourier excepted, to come to him.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="272">
It &s;eemed proper not to wait to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and as Servan's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion had taken place, tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame principles ought to give in their own, at lea&s;t unle&s;s the king would recall Ser|van, and di&s;mi&s;s Dumourier, with whom they ought never again to &s;it in council. I do not doubt but that if the four mi|ni&s;ters had behaved in this manner, the court would not have been a little em|barra&s;&s;ed to replace them; that La Co&s;te, and Duranthon would have done them|&s;elves credit, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been &s;o much the more intere&s;ting for the public, as it became &s;o in a very different manner.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters debated without coming to any conclu&s;ion, except that they would meet again the next day at eight o'clock in the morning, and that Roland &s;hould prepare a letter for them. I could ne|ver have believed, if circum&s;tances had not put me in the way of knowing it,
<PB N="263" REF="273">
that judgment and firmne&s;s of charac|ter were &s;o rare: how few men are there, con&s;equently, fitted for bu&s;ine&s;s, and how much fewer &s;till are formed to govern! Were we to wi&s;h for the union of the&s;e qualities with perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, we wi&s;h for a Phoenix, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble to find. I am not a&s;toni&s;hed that men above the common &s;tandard, and who are placed at the head of empires, &s;hould hold mo&s;t commonly the human race in contempt. It is the almo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence of great knowledge of the world; and in order to avoid the errors into which tho&s;e may fall who are entru&s;ted with the happine&s;s of nations, there mu&s;t be a fund of philo&s;ophy and of magnanimity not very common.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters kept their appointment, but concluded that it would be better to &s;peak to the king in per&s;on than to write to him; a mea&s;ure which appeared rather as an expedient to avoid lo&s;ing their places
<PB N="264" REF="274">
than to come to an explanation. While they were yet deliberating, the king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Daranthon, the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, to go immediately and alone. The mini&s;ters Roland and Clavieres went to wait for him at his hotel. Daran|thon returned with a lengthened face and hypocritical air, and drew out &s;lowly from his pocket a paper containing the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his two colleagues. "You have made us wait a long time for our liberty," &s;aid Roland to him, &s;miling, and taking the paper: he returned and acquainted me with the news, which I had well fore&s;een. I congratulated him on it, and advi&s;ed him not to wait till the king announced it to the a&s;&s;embly, but to do it him&s;elf; and, &s;ince his maje&s;ty had taken no advantage of the in&s;truc|tions contained in the letter, to make them u&s;eful to the public by publi&s;h|ing them him&s;elf. I &s;aw nothing more con&s;i&s;tent with the courage of having
<PB N="265" REF="275">
written to him, than firmne&s;s in &s;ending a copy of it to the a&s;&s;embly: in hearing of your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, the a&s;&s;embly will be|come acquainted with the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>This idea proved agreeable to my hu&s;band, and every one knows the ho|nours which the a&s;&s;embly conferred on the three mini&s;ters Servan, Roland, and Clavieres; by declaring that their di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion was accompanied by the regrets of the nation; as well as the applau&s;e be|&s;towed on the letter, which was order|ed to be printed and &s;ent into the depart|ments."</P>
<P>This citation from madame Roland's memoirs will not perhaps be thought too long, &s;ince it contains the detail of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which precipitated Lewis XVI. from the throne, and de&s;troyed monarchy in France. It is probable that at &s;ome future period this fabric would have fallen amid&s;t the &s;torms of popular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions: but its di&s;&s;olution,
<PB N="266" REF="276">
had the conduct of the court been different, would have been at lea&s;t more gentle. I have already mentioned that madame Roland &s;ent me from her pri&s;on certain papers, with a view no doubt, that I &s;hould in &s;ome happier days vindicate her memory to the world; and I have till this period, when I find that many of her pa|pers have been pre&s;erved, felt the keene&s;t regret, that I was compelled by the late &s;anguinary &s;y&s;tem to de&s;troy tho&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without taking a copy, &s;ince to have had them di&s;covered was certain death</P>
<P>Of the account of the conduct of the court written by madame Roland, ge|neral Servan the only principal actor who &s;till remains, has given me many illu&s;tra|tions. Servan, as mini&s;ter of war, had to contend not only with the enemies on the frontiers, but with tho&s;e much more for|midable to the &s;tate, in the Tuilleries. His office compelled him to hold longer
<PB N="267" REF="277">
communications with the king than the other mini&s;ters&mdash;if that could be called &s;o which was only a continued altercation&mdash;His duty prompted him to explain to him that his conduct was precipitating him&s;elf as well as the kingdom to ruin, and that the whole tenor of it di&s;covered him to be ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution, as well as to the intere&s;t of the &s;tate. "The king &s;eemed at times &s;o thoroughly convinced," &s;ays Servan, "that I deceiv|ed my&s;elf into a belief that the next meeting he would a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;i|tions offered him: but in the interval he had been a&s;&s;ailed and hardened into re|&s;i&s;tance in favour of Au&s;tria, by the queen&mdash;in favour of the prie&s;ts, by ma|dame Eli&s;abeth; &s;o that it required going the &s;ame round of argument to bring him again to conviction. The king &s;ometimes appealed to Servan as know|ing, from having been long at court, the rectitude of his intentions; to which
<PB N="268" REF="278">
Servan never would a&s;&s;ent: on the con|trary, he told him that his weakne&s;s, which was criminal, would never be any &s;hield again&s;t the indignation of the peo|ple, who would not enter into di&s;tinc|tions. Sometimes Servan finding no good was to be done that day, &s;at down to write till the hour when the council broke up, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the king ex|ceedingly; who frequently interrupted him by a&s;king if he was taking notes of their conver&s;ation. No &s;ecretary was al|lowed, though decreed by the con&s;titu|tution, and repeatedly in&s;i&s;ted on by Ro|land and Servan; the former of whom brought his great moroco covered book, under his arm, to the great diver&s;ion of Servan, in order to enter the records: but the king per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al, and the pages remained from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t un&s;ullied.</P>
