<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally thought, that as Pa&s;torals are a kind of poetry, which has been touch'd upon by &s;uch a number of poets, that they are ea&s;ily compos'd, and that their thoughts and &s;entiments mu&s;t be trite and vulgar. However this opinion may be true in rea&s;on, I hope the following pieces will be exempt from it's cen&s;ure, as they are form'd on a plan entirely new, and as their de&s;ign is e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;h'd from any pro|ductions of their kind, either ancient or modern: unle&s;s it be that the fir&s;t and ninth Bucolic of Virgil are in the &s;ame nature. How the ideas of fields and woods, and a poetry who&s;e very e&s;&s;ence is a rural life, will agree with the polite ta&s;te of the town, and of gentlemen who are more con|ver&s;ant in the fa&s;hionable ornaments of life, is a que&s;tion: but I hope as they relate to that war, which is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t general topic of con|ver&s;ation, this unpolitene&s;s will in &s;ome mea&s;ure be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
The learned reader will ob&s;erve, that the au|thor has endeavour'd to imitate the &s;implicity of the ancients in the&s;e pieces, as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to Pa&s;toral, but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in gene|ral. As to the de&s;ign of this work, I hope it will not be thought odd, or ill-cho&s;en. The op|po&s;ing intere&s;ts of a peaceful and rural life, and the tumultuous &s;cenes of war, together with the various &s;truggles and pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from thence, &s;eem by no means an improper field for the mo&s;t elegant writer to exerci&s;e his genius in. How far the author of the&s;e pieces has &s;ucceeded in the performance of this, is humbly &s;ubmitted to the cen&s;ure and judgment of the public.</P>

<L>ARISE, my Lycas: in yon' woody wilds</L>
<L>From a rough rock in deep enclo&s;ure hid</L>
<L>Of thicke&s;t oaks, a gu&s;hing fountain falls,</L>
<L>And pours it's airy &s;tream with torrent pure:</L>
<L>Which late returning from the field at eve</L>
<L>I found, invited by it's da&s;hing &s;ound,</L>
<L>As thro' the gloom it &s;truck my pa&s;&s;ing ear.</L>
<L>Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks;</L>
<L>Fit place to cool their thir&s;t in mid-day hour.</L>
<L>Due we&s;t it rifes from that bla&s;ted beech;</L>

<L>Alas, my friend, of flock,</L>
<L>Of &s;pring, or &s;hepherd's lore, to me is vain</L>
<L>To tell: my fav'rite lamb, the &s;olace dear</L>
<L>Of the&s;e grey locks, my &s;weet and &s;ole delight,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"> Is &s;natch'd by cruel fate! an armed band</L>
<L>On neighing &s;teeds elate, in wide array</L>
<L>Trampled the youngling, as the vale along</L>
<L>At eve they pa&s;s'd, beneath their whelming march.</L>

<SPEAKER>ALPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such throng I heard, as in the neighb'ring wood</L>
<L>I wander'd to reduce a &s;traggling ewe</L>
<L>E&s;cap'd the fold: what time the grie&s;ly owl</L>
<L>Her &s;hrieks began, and at the wonted elm</L>
<L>The cows awaiting &s;tood Lucilla's hand.</L>
<L>When &s;trait with &s;udden fear alarm'd I &s;tart,</L>
<L>And li&s;t'ning to the di&s;tant-echoing &s;teps</L>
<L>Of un&s;een hor&s;emen with attentive ear,</L>

<L>Alphon, no more to Lycas now remains,</L>
<L>Since he my la&s;t and late&s;t care is lo&s;t!</L>
<L>Thou know'&s;t my little flock; three tender ewes</L>
<L>Were all my mean ambition wi&s;h'd or &s;ought.</L>
<L>Ev'n now nine days, and nine revolving nights</L>
<L>Are pa&s;t, &s;ince the&s;e the Moldaw's raging flood</L>
<L>Swept with their wattled cotes, as o'er it's banks</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"> It ro&s;e redundant, &s;woln with beating rains,</L>
<L>And deep immers'd beneath it's whirling wave.</L>
<L>I wak'd at early dawn, and to the field</L>

<L>When lo! nor flocks, nor wattled cotes I &s;aw;</L>
<L>But all that met my wond'ring eyes around,</L>
<L>Was de&s;olation &s;ad. Here &s;tatelie&s;t oaks</L>
<L>Torn from their roots, with broken branches lay</L>
<L>In hideous ruin: there the fields, that laugh'd</L>
<L>With rip'ning corn, of all their charms de&s;poil'd,</L>
<L>With oozy fragments &s;catter'd wa&s;te and wild</L>
<L>Were &s;een. I cur&s;t the wicked &s;pirit drear,</L>
<L>That in the ruin'd abbey's darke&s;t cell,</L>
<L>(That &s;tands immur'd amid yon' lone&s;ome pines)</L>
<L>I bound with triple chains: his magic pow'r</L>
<L>Oft'times with howling &s;torms, and thunder loud</L>
<L>Deforms the night, and blackens nature's face.</L>
<L>His tempe&s;ts &s;well'd the Moldaw's ri&s;ing &s;treams,</L>
<L>And thus o'erwhelm'd my flock.&mdash;But this my heart</L>
<L>Had learn'd to bear, at length to comfort's voice</L>
<L>It had obey'd, and all it's woes forgot;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"> When ah! too &s;oon returning woes invade</L>
<L>My brea&s;t, ju&s;t ri&s;ing from its former &s;troke.</L>

<L>I hap'ly plac'd him with providing care,</L>

<L>Threaten'd de&s;truction, and to low'r began,</L>

<L>My&s;elf had fall'n a victim to their rage,</L>
<L>As in deep dead of night my cave beneath</L>
<L>I lay di&s;&s;olv'd in &s;leep, with warning voice</L>
<L>Had not my dog alarm'd with wond'ring ear.</L>

<L>A hoard of choice&s;t che&s;nuts, which I cull'd</L>
<L>With nice-di&s;cerning care, and had de&s;ign'd</L>

<L>Ah! what avail'd my care, and fore&s;ight vain?</L>
<L>That day he fell oppre&s;s'd by whelming &s;teeds.</L>
<L>This hand had built a bow'r of thicke&s;t boughs</L>
<L>Compos'd, and wove with intermingling leaves,</L>
<L>Impervious to the &s;un; and &s;trew'd the floor</L>
