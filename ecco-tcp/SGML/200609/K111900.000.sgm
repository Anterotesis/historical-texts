<HEAD>PAMPHILUS to HERMIPPUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been remarked, my HERMIPPUS, that,
though the ancient philo&s;ophers conveyed mo&s;t
of their in&s;truction in the form of dialogue,
this method of compo&s;ition has been little practi|&s;ed
in later ages, and has &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in the
hands of tho&s;e, who have attempted it. Accurate
and regular argument, indeed, &s;uch as is now ex|pected
of philo&s;ophical enquirers, naturally throws
a man into the methodical and didactic manner;
where he can immediately, without preparation,
explain the point, at which he aims; and thence
<PB REF="3">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="2" REF="4">
proceed, without interruption, to deduce the
proofs, on which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. To deliver a
SYSTEM in conver&s;ation &s;carcely appears natu|ral;
and while the dialogue-writer de&s;ires, by de|parting
from the direct &s;tyle of compo&s;ition, to
give a freer air to his performance, and avoid the
appearance of <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Reader,</HI> he is apt to
run into a wor&s;e inconvenience, and convey the
image of <HI>Pedagogue</HI> and <HI>Pupil.</HI> Or if he carries
on the di&s;pute in the natural &s;pirit of good com|pany,
by throwing in a variety of topics, and pre|&s;erving
a proper balance among the &s;peakers; he
often lo&s;es &s;o much time in preparations and tran&s;i|tions,
that the reader will &s;carcely think him&s;elf
compen&s;ated, by all the graces of dialogue, for
the order, brevity, and preci&s;ion, which are &s;a|crificed
to them.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;ubjects, however, to which
dialogue-writing is peculiarly adapted, and where
it is &s;till preferable to the direct and &s;imple me|thod
of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Any point of doctrine, which is &s;o <HI>obvious,</HI>
that it &s;carcely admits of di&s;pute, but at the &s;ame
time &s;o <HI>important,</HI> that it cannot be too often in|culcated,
&s;eems to require &s;ome &s;uch method of
handling it; where the novelty of the manner may
compen&s;ate the tritene&s;s of the &s;ubject, where the
vivacity of conver&s;ation may enforce the precept,
and where the variety of lights, pre&s;ented by va|rious
per&s;onages and characters, may appear nei|ther
tedious nor redundant.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
Any que&s;tion of philo&s;ophy, on the other hand,
which is &s;o <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> and <HI>uncertain,</HI> that human
rea&s;on can reach no fixed determination with re|gard
to it; if it &s;hould be treated at all; &s;eems to
lead us naturally into the &s;tyle of dialogue and
conver&s;ation. Rea&s;onable men may be allowed to
differ, where no one can rea&s;onably be po&s;itive:
Oppo&s;ite &s;entiments, even without any deci&s;ion,
afford an agreeable amu&s;ement: and if the &s;ub|ject
be curious and intere&s;ting, the book carries
us, in a manner, into company, and unites the
two greate&s;t and pure&s;t plea&s;ures of human life,
&s;tudy and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Happily, the&s;e circum&s;tances are all to be found
in the &s;ubject of NATURAL RELIGION.
What truth &s;o obvious, &s;o certain, as the BEING
of a God, which the mo&s;t ignorant ages have ac|knowledged,
for which the mo&s;t refined geniu&s;es
have ambitiou&s;ly &s;triven to produce new proofs
and arguments? What truth &s;o important as this,
which is the ground of all our hopes, the &s;ure&s;t
foundation of morality, the firme&s;t &s;upport of &s;o|ciety,
and the only principle, which ought never
to be a moment ab&s;ent from our thoughts and me|ditations?
But in treating of this obvious and
important truth; what ob&s;cure que&s;tions occur,
concerning the NATURE of that divine being;
his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?
The&s;e have been always &s;ubjected to the di&s;puta|tions
of men: Concerning the&s;e, human rea&s;on
has not reached any certain determination: But
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the&s;e are topics &s;o intere&s;ting, that we cannot re|&s;train
our re&s;tle&s;s enquiry with regard to them;
though nothing but doubt, uncertainty and con|tradiction
have, as yet, been the re&s;ult of our
mo&s;t accurate re&s;earches.</P>
<P>This I had lately occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, while I
pa&s;&s;ed, as u&s;ual, part of the &s;ummer-&s;ea&s;on with
CLEANTHES, and was pre&s;ent at tho&s;e con|ver&s;ations
of his with PHILO and DEMEA,
of which I gave you lately &s;ome imperfect ac|count.
Your curio&s;ity, you then told me, was
&s;o excited, that I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity enter into a
more exact detail of their rea&s;onings, and di&s;play
tho&s;e various &s;y&s;tems, which they advanced with
regard to &s;o delicate a &s;ubject as that of Natural
Religion. The remarkable contra&s;t in their cha|racters
&s;till farther rai&s;ed your expectations; while
you oppo&s;ed the accurate philo&s;ophical turn of
CLEANTHES to the carele&s;s &s;ceptici&s;m of PHILO,
or compared either of their di&s;po&s;itions with the
rigid inflexible orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth
rendered me a mere auditor of their di&s;putes; and
that curio&s;ity natural to the early &s;ea&s;on of life,
has &s;o deeply imprinted in my memory the whole
chain and connection of their arguments, that, I
hope, I &s;hall not omit or confound any con&s;ider|able
part of them in the recital.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER I joined the company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part I.</NOTE> whom I
found &s;itting in CLEANTHES's library,
DEMEA paid CLEANTHES &s;ome compliments,
on the great care, which he took of my educa|tion,
and on his unwearied per&s;everance and con|&s;tancy
in all his friend&s;hips. The father of PAM|PHILUS,
&s;aid he, was your intimate friend: The
&s;on is your pupil, and may indeed be regarded as
your adopted &s;on; were we to judge by the pains
which you be&s;tow in conveying to him every u&s;e|ful
branch of literature and &s;cience. You are no
more wanting, I am per&s;uaded, in prudence than
in indu&s;try. I &s;hall, therefore, communicate to
you a maxim which I have ob&s;erved with regard
to my own children, that I may learn how far
it agrees with your practice. The method I fol|low
in their education is founded on the &s;aying of
an ancient, <Q><HI>That &s;tudents of philo&s;ophy ought
fir&s;t to learn Logics, then Ethics, next
Phy&s;ics, la&s;t of all, the Nature of the
Gods</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;ippus apud Plut. de repug. Stoicorum.</NOTE>.</Q> This &s;cience of Natural Theology,
according to him, being the mo&s;t profound and
ab&s;tru&s;e of any, required the mature&s;t judge|ment
in its &s;tudents; and none but a mind, en|riched
with all the other &s;ciences, can &s;afely be
entru&s;ted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
Are you &s;o late, &s;ays PHILO, in teaching your
children the principles of religion? Is there no
danger of their neglecting or rejecting altogether
tho&s;e opinions, of which they have heard &s;o
little, during the whole cour&s;e of their educa|tion?
It is only as a &s;cience, replied DEMEA,
&s;ubjected to human rea&s;oning and di&s;putation,
that I po&s;tpone the &s;tudy of Natural Theology.
To &s;ea&s;on their minds with early piety is my chief
care; and by continual precept and in&s;truction,
and I hope too, by example, I imprint deeply on
their tender minds an habitual reverence for all
the principles of religion. While they pa&s;s
through every other &s;cience, I &s;till remark the
uncertainty of each part, the eternal di&s;putations
of men, the ob&s;curity of all philo&s;ophy, and the
&s;trange, ridiculous conclu&s;ions, which &s;ome of
the greate&s;t geniu&s;es have derived from the prin|ciples
of mere human rea&s;on. Having thus tamed
their mind to a proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;elf-diffi|dence,
I have no longer any &s;cruple of opening
to them the greate&s;t my&s;teries of religion, nor
apprehend any danger from that a&s;&s;uming arro|gance
of philo&s;ophy, which may lead them to re|ject
the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines and opinions.</P>
<P>Your precaution, &s;ays PHILO, of &s;ea&s;oning
your childrens minds with early piety, is certain|ly
very rea&s;onable; and no more than is requi|&s;ite,
in this profane and irreligious age. But
what I chiefly admire in your plan of education,
is your method of drawing advantage from the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
very principles of philo&s;ophy and learning, which,
by in&s;piring pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, have com|monly,
in all ages, been found &s;o de&s;tructive to
the principles of religion. The vulgar, indeed,
we may remark, who are unacquainted with
&s;cience and profound enquiry, ob&s;erving the end|le&s;s
di&s;putes of the learned, have commonly a tho|rough
contempt for Philo&s;ophy; and rivet them|&s;elves
the fa&s;ter, by that means, in the great
points of Theology, which have been taught them.
Tho&s;e, who enter a little into &s;tudy and enquiry,
finding many appearances of evidence in doctrines
the newe&s;t and mo&s;t extraordinary, think nothing
too difficult for human rea&s;on; and pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly
breaking through all &s;ences, profane the
inmo&s;t fanctuaries of the temple. But CLEAN|THES
will, I hope, agree with me, that, after
we have abandoned ignorance, the &s;ure&s;t remedy,
there is &s;till one expedient left to prevent this
profane liberty. Let DEMEA's principles be im|proved
and cultivated: Let us become thorough|ly
&s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s, blindne&s;s, and nar|row
limits of human rea&s;on: Let us duly con&s;ider
its uncertainty and endle&s;s contrarieties, even in
&s;ubjects of common life and practice: Let the
errors and deceits of our very &s;en&s;es be &s;et before
us; the in&s;uperable difficulties, which attend fir&s;t
principles in all &s;y&s;tems; the contradictions, which
adhere to the very ideas of matter, cau&s;e and ef|fect,
exten&s;ion, &s;pace, time, motion; and in a
word, quantity of all kinds, the object of the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
only &s;cience, that can fairly pretend to any cer|tainty
or evidence. When the&s;e topics are di&s;|played
in their full light, as they are by &s;ome
philo&s;ophers and almo&s;t all divines; who can re|tain
&s;uch confidence in this frail faculty of rea&s;on
as to pay any regard to its determinations in points
&s;o &s;ublime, &s;o ab&s;tru&s;e, &s;o remote from common
life and experience? When the coherence of the
parts of a &s;tone, or even that compo&s;ition of parts,
which renders it extended; when the&s;e familiar
objects, I &s;ay, are &s;o inexplicable, and contain
circum&s;tances &s;o repugnant and contradictory;
with what a&s;&s;urance can we decide concerning the
origin of worlds, or trace their hi&s;tory from e|ternity
to eternity?</P>
<P>While PHILO pronounced the&s;e words, I could
ob&s;erve a &s;mile in the countenance both of DE|MEA
and CLEANTHES. That of DEMEA &s;eem|ed
to imply an unre&s;erved &s;atisfaction in the doc|trines
delivered: But in CLEANTHES's features,
I could di&s;tingui&s;h an air of fine&s;&s;e; as if he per|ceived
&s;ome raillery or artificial malice in the rea|&s;onings
of PHILO.</P>
<P>You propo&s;e then, PHILO, &s;aid CLEANTHES,
to erect religious faith on philo&s;ophical &s;ceptici&s;m;
and you think, that if certainty or evidence be
expelled from every other &s;ubject of enquiry, it
will all retire to the&s;e theological doctrines, and
there acquire a &s;uperior force and authority.
Whether your &s;ceptici&s;m be as ab&s;olute and &s;in|cere
as you pretend, we &s;hall learn by and by,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
when the company breaks up: We &s;hall then &s;ee,
whether you go out at the door or the window;
and whether you really doubt, if your body has
gravity, or can be injured by its fall; according
to popular opinion, derived from our fallacious
&s;en&s;es and more fallacious experience. And this
con&s;ideration, DEMEA, may, I think, fairly &s;erve
to abate our ill-will to this humorous &s;ect of
the &s;ceptics. If they be thoroughly in earne&s;t,
they will not long trouble the world with their
doubts, cavils, and di&s;putes: If they be only in
je&s;t, they are, perhaps, bad ralliers, but can ne|ver
be very dangerous, either to the &s;tate, to
philo&s;ophy, or to religion.</P>
<P>In reality, PHILO, continued he, it &s;eems cer|tain,
that though a man, in a flu&s;h of humour,
after inten&s;e reflection on the many contradictions
and imperfections of human rea&s;on, may entirely
renounce all belief and opinion; it is impo&s;&s;ible
for him to per&s;evere in this total &s;ceptici&s;m, or
make it appear in his conduct for a few hours.
External objects pre&s;s in upon him: Pa&s;&s;ions &s;o|licit
him: His philo&s;ophical melancholy di&s;&s;ipates;
and even the utmo&s;t violence upon his own tem|per
will not be able, during any time, to pre&s;erve
the poor appearance of &s;ceptici&s;m. And for what
rea&s;on impo&s;e on him&s;elf &s;uch a violence? This
is a point, in which it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him
ever to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, con&s;i&s;tently with his &s;ceptical
principles: So that upon the whole nothing could
be more ridiculous than the principles of the an|cient
<PB N="10" REF="12">
PYRRHONIANS; if in reality they endea|voured,
as is pretended, to extend throughout,
the &s;ame &s;ceptici&s;m, which they had learned from
the declamations of their &s;chools, and which they
ought to have confined to them.</P>
<P>In this view, there appears a great re&s;emblance
between the &s;ects of the STOICS and PYRRHO|NIANS,
though perpetual antagoni&s;ts: and both
of them &s;eem founded on this erroneous maxim,
That what a man can perform &s;ometimes, and in
&s;ome di&s;po&s;itions, he can perform always, and in
every di&s;po&s;ition. When the mind, by Stoical
reflections, is elevated into a &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m
of virtue, and &s;trongly &s;mit with any <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of
honour or public good, the utmo&s;t bodily pain
and &s;ufferance will not prevail over &s;uch a high
&s;en&s;e of duty; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible, perhaps, by its
means, even to &s;mile and exult in the mid&s;t of
tortures. If this &s;ometimes may be the ca&s;e in
fact and reality, much more may a philo&s;opher,
in his &s;chool, or even in his clo&s;et, work him&s;elf
up to &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;m, and &s;upport in imagi|nation
the acute&s;t pain or mo&s;t calamitous event,
which he can po&s;&s;ibly conceive. But how &s;hall
he &s;upport this enthu&s;ia&s;m it&s;elf? The bent of
his mind relaxes, and cannot be recalled at plea|&s;ure:
Avocations lead him a&s;tray: Misfortunes
attack him unawares: And the <HI>philo&s;opher</HI>
&s;inks by degrees into the <HI>plebeian.</HI></P>
<P>I allow of your compari&s;on between the STOICS
and SCEPTICS, replied PHILO. But you may
<PB N="11" REF="13">
ob&s;erve, at the &s;ame time, that though the mind
cannot, in Stoici&s;m, &s;upport the highe&s;t flights of
philo&s;ophy, yet even when it &s;inks lower, it &s;till
retains &s;omewhat of its former di&s;po&s;ition; and
the effects of the Stoic's rea&s;oning will appear in
his conduct in common life, and through the
whole tenor of his actions. The ancient &s;chools,
particularly that of ZENO, produced examples of
virtue and con&s;tancy, which &s;eem a&s;toni&s;hing to
pre&s;ent times.</P>
<Q><L>Vain Wi&s;dom all and fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy.</L>
<L>Yet with a plea&s;ing &s;orcery could charm</L>
<L>Pain, for a while, or angui&s;h, and excite</L>
<L>Fallacious Hope, or arm the obdurate brea&s;t</L>
<L>With &s;tubborn Patience, as with triple &s;teel.</L></Q>
<P>In like manner, if a man has accu&s;tomed him|&s;elf
to &s;ceptical con&s;iderations on the uncertainty
and narrow limits of rea&s;on, he will not entirely
forget them when he turns his reflection on
other &s;ubjects; but in all his philo&s;ophical prin|ciples
and rea&s;oning, I dare not &s;ay, in his com|mon
conduct, he will be found different from
tho&s;e, who either never formed any opinions in
the ca&s;e, or have entertained &s;entiments more fa|vourable
to human rea&s;on.</P>
<P>To whatever length any one may pu&s;h his &s;pe|culative
principles of &s;ceptici&s;m, he mu&s;t act, I
own, and live, and conver&s;e like other men;
and for this conduct he is not obliged to give
<PB N="12" REF="14">
any other rea&s;on, than the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity he
lies under of &s;o doing. If he ever carries his
&s;peculations farther than this nece&s;&s;ity con&s;trains
him, and philo&s;ophi&s;es, either on natural or mo|ral
&s;ubjects, he is allured by a certain plea&s;ure
and &s;atisfaction, which he finds in employing him|&s;elf
after that manner. He con&s;iders be&s;ides,
that every one, even in common life, is con&s;train|ed
to have more or le&s;s of this philo&s;ophy; that
from our earlie&s;t infancy we make continual ad|vances
in forming more general principles of con|duct
and rea&s;oning; that the larger experience
we acquire, and the &s;tronger rea&s;on we are en|dued
with, we always render our principles the
more general and comprehen&s;ive; and that what
we call <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> is nothing but a more regular
and methodical operation of the &s;ame kind. To
philo&s;ophi&s;e on &s;uch &s;ubjects is nothing e&s;&s;entially
different from rea&s;oning on common life; and
we may only expect greater &s;tability, if not great|er
truth, from our philo&s;ophy, on account of its
exacter and more &s;crupulous method of proceed|ing.</P>
<P>But when we look beyond human affairs and
the properties of the &s;urrounding bodies: When
we carry our &s;peculations into the two eternities,
before and after the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things; into
the creation and formation of the univer&s;e; the
exi&s;tence and properties of &s;pirits; the powers
and operations of one univer&s;al &s;pirit, exi&s;ting
without beginning and without end; omnipotent,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
omni&s;cient, immutable, infinite, and incompre|hen&s;ible:
We mu&s;t be far removed from the
&s;malle&s;t tendency to &s;ceptici&s;m not to be apprehen|&s;ive,
that we have here got quite beyond the
reach of our faculties. So long as we confine our
&s;peculations to trade, or morals, or politics, or
critici&s;m, we make appeals, every moment, to
common &s;en&s;e and experience, which &s;trengthen
our philo&s;ophical conclu&s;ions, and remove (at
lea&s;t, in part) the &s;u&s;picion, which we &s;o ju&s;tly
entertain with regard to every rea&s;oning, that is
very &s;ubtile and refined. But in theological rea|&s;onings,
we have not this advantage; while at the
&s;ame time we are employed upon objects, which,
we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, are too large for our gra&s;p,
and of all others, require mo&s;t to be familiari&s;ed
to our apprehen&s;ion. We are like foreigners in
a &s;trange country, to whom every thing mu&s;t
&s;eem &s;u&s;picious, and who are in danger every
moment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing again&s;t the laws and cu|&s;toms
of the people, with whom they live and
conver&s;e. We know not how far we ought to
tru&s;t our vulgar methods of rea&s;oning in &s;uch a
&s;ubject; &s;ince, even in common life and in that
province, which is peculiarly appropriated to them,
we cannot account for them, and are entirely
guided by a kind of in&s;tinct or nece&s;&s;ity in em|ploying
them.</P>
<P>All &s;ceptics pretend, that, if rea&s;on be con&s;i|dered
in an ab&s;tract view, it furni&s;hes invincible
arguments again&s;t it&s;elf, and that we could ne|ver
<PB N="14" REF="16">
retain any conviction or a&s;&s;urance, on any
&s;ubject, were not the &s;ceptical rea&s;onings &s;o re|fined
and &s;ubtile, that they are not able to coun|terpoi&s;e
the more &s;olid and more natural argu|ments,
derived from the &s;en&s;es and experience.
But it is evident, whenever our arguments lo&s;e
this advantage, and run wide of common life,
that the mo&s;t refined &s;ceptici&s;m comes to be upon
a footing with them, and is able to oppo&s;e and
counterbalance them. The one has no more
weight than the other. The mind mu&s;t remain
in &s;u&s;pen&s;e between them; and it is that very
&s;u&s;pen&s;e or balance, which is the triumph of
&s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>But I ob&s;erve, &s;ays CLEANTHES, with regard
to you, PHILO, and all &s;peculative &s;ceptics, that
your doctrine and practice are as much at variance
in the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e points of theory as in the con|duct
of common life. Where-ever evidence di&s;|covers
it&s;elf, you adhere to it, notwith&s;tanding
your pretended &s;ceptici&s;m; and I can ob&s;erve too
&s;ome of your &s;ect to be as deci&s;ive as tho&s;e, who
make greater profe&s;&s;ions of certainty and a&s;&s;u|rance.
In reality, would not a man be ridicu|lous,
who pretended to reject NEWTON's expli|cation
of the wonderful phenomenon of the rain|bow,
becau&s;e that explication gives a minute ana|tomy
of the rays of light; a &s;ubject, for&s;ooth,
too refined for human comprehen&s;ion? And what
would you &s;ay to one, who having nothing parti|cular
to object to the arguments of COPERNICUS
<PB N="15" REF="17">
and GALILAEO for the motion of the earth,
&s;hould with-hold his a&s;&s;ent, on that general prin|ciple,
That the&s;e &s;ubjects were too magnificent
and remote to be explained by the narrow and fal|lacious
rea&s;on of mankind?</P>
<P>There is indeed a kind of bruti&s;h and ignorant
&s;ceptici&s;m, as you well ob&s;erved, which gives the
vulgar a general prejudice again&s;t what they do
not ea&s;ily under&s;tand, and makes them reject e|very
principle, which requires elaborate rea&s;oning
to prove and e&s;tabli&s;h it. This &s;pecies of &s;cepti|ci&s;m
is fatal to knowledge, not to religion; &s;ince
we find, that tho&s;e who make greate&s;t profe&s;&s;ion
of it, give often their a&s;&s;ent, not only to the great
truths of Thei&s;m, and natural theology, but even
to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd tenets, which a traditional &s;u|per&s;tition
has recommended to them. They firm|ly
believe in witches; though they will not be|lieve
nor attend to the mo&s;t &s;imple propo&s;ition of
EUCLID. But the refined and philo&s;ophical &s;cep|tics
fall into an incon&s;i&s;tence of an oppo&s;ite na|ture.
They pu&s;h their re&s;earches into the mo&s;t
ab&s;tru&s;e corners of &s;cience; and their a&s;&s;ent at|tends
them in every &s;tep, proportioned to the
evidence, which they meet with. They are e|ven
obliged to acknowledge, that the mo&s;t ab|&s;tru&s;e
and remote objects are tho&s;e, which are
be&s;t explained by philo&s;ophy. Light is in reality
anatomized: The true &s;y&s;tem of the heavenly
bodies is di&s;covered and a&s;certained. But the
nouri&s;hment of bodies by food is &s;till an inexpli|cable
<PB N="16" REF="18">
my&s;tery: The cohe&s;ion of the parts of mat|ter
is &s;till incomprehen&s;ible. The&s;e &s;ceptics, there|fore,
are obliged, in every que&s;tion, to con&s;ider
each particular evidence apart, and proportion
their a&s;&s;ent to the preci&s;e degree of evidence,
which occurs. This is their practice in all natu|ral,
mathematical, moral, and political &s;cience.
And why not the &s;ame, I a&s;k, in the theological
and religious? Why mu&s;t conclu&s;ions of this
nature be alone rejected on the general pre&s;ump|tion
of the in&s;ufficiency of human rea&s;on, without
any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the evidence? Is not
&s;uch an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice
and pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;es, you &s;ay, are fallacious, our under|&s;tanding
erroneous, our ideas even of the mo&s;t
familiar objects, exten&s;ion, duration, motion,
full of ab&s;urdities and contradictions. You defy
me to &s;olve the difficulties, or reconcile the repug|nancies,
which you di&s;cover in them. I have not
capacity for &s;o great an undertaking: I have not
lei&s;ure for it: I perceive it to be &s;uperfluous.
Your own conduct, in every circum&s;tance, refutes
your principles; and &s;hows the firme&s;t reliance
on all the received maxims of &s;cience, morals,
prudence, and behaviour.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never a&s;&s;ent to &s;o har&s;h an opinion as that
of a celebrated writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'art de pen&s;er.</NOTE>, who &s;ays, that the &s;cep|tics
are not a &s;ect of philo&s;ophers: They are only
<PB N="17" REF="19">
a &s;ect of liars. I may, however, affirm, (I hope,
without offence) that they are a &s;ect of je&s;ters or
ralliers. But for my part, whenever I find my&s;elf
di&s;po&s;ed to mirth and amu&s;ement, I &s;hall certainly
chu&s;e my entertainment of a le&s;s perplexing and
ab&s;tru&s;e nature. A comedy, a novel, or at mo&s;t
a hi&s;tory, &s;eems a more natural recreation than
&s;uch metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilties and ab&s;tractions.</P>
<P>In vain would the &s;ceptic make a di&s;tinction be|tween
&s;cience and common life, or between one
&s;cience and another. The arguments, employed
in all, if ju&s;t, are of a &s;imilar nature, and contain
the &s;ame force and evidence. Or if there be any
difference among them, the advantage lies entire|ly
on the &s;ide of theology and natural religion.
Many principles of mechanics are founded on very
ab&s;tru&s;e rea&s;oning; yet no man, who has any
preten&s;ions to &s;cience, even no &s;peculative &s;ceptic,
pretends to entertain the lea&s;t doubt with regard
to them. The COPERNICAN &s;y&s;tem contains
the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing paradox, and the mo&s;t contrary
to our natural conceptions, to appearances, and
to our very &s;en&s;es: yet even monks and inqui&s;i|tors
are now con&s;trained to withdraw their oppo|&s;ition
to it. And &s;hall PHILO, a man of &s;o libe|ral
a genius, and exten&s;ive knowledge, entertain
any general undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;cruples with regard
to the religious hypothe&s;is, which is founded on
the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious arguments, and,
unle&s;s it meets with artificial ob&s;tacles, has &s;uch
ea&s;y acce&s;s and admi&s;&s;ion into the mind of man?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
And here we may ob&s;erve, continued he, turn|ing
him&s;elf towards DEMEA, a pretty curious cir|cum&s;tance
in the hi&s;tory of the &s;ciences. After
the union of philo&s;ophy with the popular religion,
upon the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, no|thing
was more u&s;ual, among all religious teach|ers,
than declamations again&s;t rea&s;on, again&s;t the
&s;en&s;es, again&s;t every principle, derived merely
from human re&s;earch and enquiry. All the topics
of the ancient Academics were adopted by the Fa|thers;
and thence propagated for &s;everal ages in
every &s;chool and pulpit throughout Chri&s;tendom.
The Reformers embraced the &s;ame principles of
rea&s;oning, or rather declamation; and all pane|gyrics
on the excellency of faith were &s;ure to be interlarded with &s;ome &s;evere &s;trokes of &s;atire a|gain&s;t
natural rea&s;on. A celebrated prelate too<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s; Huet.</NOTE>,
of the Romi&s;h communion, a man of the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive learning, who wrote a demon&s;tration of
Chri&s;tianity, has al&s;o compo&s;ed a treati&s;e, which
contains all the cavils of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t de|termined
PYRRHONISM. LOCKE &s;eems to have
been the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian, who ventured openly to
a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>faith</HI> was nothing but a &s;pecies of
<HI>rea&s;on,</HI> that religion was only a branch of philo|&s;ophy,
and that a chain of arguments, &s;imilar to that which e&s;tabli&s;hed any truth in morals, poli|tics,
or phy&s;ics, was always employed in di&s;cover|ing
all the principles of theology, natural and re|vealed.
<PB N="19" REF="21">
The ill u&s;e, which BAYLE and other li|bertines
made of the philo&s;ophical &s;ceptici&s;m of
the fathers and fir&s;t reformers, &s;till farther propa|gated
the judicious &s;entiment of Mr LOCKE: and
it is now, in a manner, avowed, by all pretenders
to rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy, that Athei&s;t and
Sceptic are almo&s;t &s;ynonymous. And as is cer|tain,
that no man is in earne&s;t, when he profe&s;&s;es
the latter principle; I would fain hope, that there
are as few, who &s;eriou&s;ly maintain the former.</P>
<P>Don't you remember, &s;aid PHILO, the excel|lent
&s;aying of Lord BACON on this head? That a
little philo&s;ophy, replied CLEANTHES, makes a
man an Athei&s;t: a great deal converts him to re|ligion.
That is a very judicious remark too, &s;aid
PHILO. But what I have in my eye is another
pa&s;&s;age, where, having mentioned DAVID's fool,
who &s;aid in his heart there is no God, this great
philo&s;opher ob&s;erves, that the Athei&s;ts now-a-days
have a double &s;hare of folly: for they are not con|tented
to &s;ay in their hearts there is no God, but
they al&s;o utter that impiety with their lips, and are
thereby guilty of multiplied indi&s;cretion and im|prudence.
Such people, though they were ever
&s;o much in earne&s;t, cannot, methinks, be very
formidable.</P>
<P>But though you &s;hould rank me in this cla&s;s of
fools, I cannot forbear communicating a remark,
that occurs to me from the hi&s;tory of the reli|gious
and irreligious &s;ceptici&s;m, with which you
have entertained us. It appears to me, that there
<PB N="20" REF="22">
are &s;trong &s;ymptoms of prie&s;tcraft in the whole
progre&s;s of this affair. During ignorant ages,
&s;uch as tho&s;e which followed the di&s;&s;olution of the
ancient &s;chools, the prie&s;ts perceived, that Athe|i&s;m,
Dei&s;m, or here&s;y of any kind, could only
proceed from the pre&s;umptuous que&s;tioning of
received opinions, and from a belief, that human
rea&s;on was equal to every thing. Education had
then a mighty influence over the minds of men,
and was almo&s;t equal in force to tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions
of the &s;en&s;es and common under&s;tanding, by
which the mo&s;t determined &s;ceptic mu&s;t allow
him&s;elf to be governed. But at pre&s;ent, when
the influence of education is much dimini&s;hed,
and men, from a more open commerce of the
world, have learned to compare the popular prin|ciples
of different nations and ages, our &s;agacious
divines have changed their whole &s;y&s;tem of philo|&s;ophy,
and talk the language of STOICS, PLA|TONISTS,
and PERIPATETICS, not that of
PYRRHONIANS and ACADEMICS. If we di&s;tru&s;t
human rea&s;on, we have now no other principle to
lead us into religion. Thus, &s;ceptics in one age,
dogmati&s;ts in another; whichever &s;y&s;tem be&s;t
&s;uits the purpo&s;e of the&s;e reverend gentlemen, in
giving them an a&s;cendant over mankind, they are
&s;ure to make it their favorite principle, and e|&s;tabli&s;hed
tenet.</P>
<P>It is very natural, &s;aid CLEANTHES, for men
to embrace tho&s;e principles, by which they find
they can be&s;t defend their doctrines; nor need we
<PB N="21" REF="23">
have any recour&s;e to prie&s;tcraft to account for &s;o
rea&s;onable an expedient. And &s;urely, nothing
can afford a &s;tronger pre&s;umption, that any &s;et of
principles are true, and ought to be embraced,
than to ob&s;erve, that they tend to the confirma|tion
of true religion, and &s;erve to confound the
cavils of Athei&s;ts, Libertines, and Freethinkers of
all denominations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I mu&s;t own, CLEANTHES, &s;aid DEMEA,
that nothing can more &s;urpri&s;e me, than the light,
in which you have, all along, put this argument.
By the whole tenor of your di&s;cour&s;e, one would
imagine that you were maintaining the Being of
a God, again&s;t the cavils of Athei&s;ts and Infidels;
and were nece&s;&s;itated to become a champion for
that fundamental principle of all religion. But this,
I hope, is not, by any means, a que&s;tion among
us. No man; no man, at lea&s;t, of common
&s;en&s;e, I am per&s;uaded, ever entertained a &s;erious
doubt with regard to a truth, &s;o certain and &s;elf-evident.
The que&s;tion is not concerning the
BEING, but the NATURE of GOD. This I
affirm, from the infirmities of human under&s;tand|ing,
to be altogether incomprehen&s;ible and un|known
to us. The e&s;&s;ence of that &s;upreme mind,
his attributes, the manner of his exi&s;tence, the
very nature of his duration; the&s;e and every par|ticular,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
which regards &s;o divine a Being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part II.</NOTE> are my|&s;terious
to men. Finite, weak, and blind crea|tures,
we ought to humble our&s;elves in his augu&s;t
pre&s;ence, and, con&s;cious of our frailties, adore
in &s;ilence his infinite perfections, which eye hath
not &s;een, ear hath not heard, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man to conceive.
They are covered in a deep cloud from human
curio&s;ity: It is profanene&s;s to attempt penetrating
through the&s;e &s;acred ob&s;curities: And next to
the impiety of denying his exi&s;tence, is the teme|rity
of prying into his nature and e&s;&s;ence, decrees
and attributes.</P>
<P>But le&s;t you &s;hould think, that my <HI>piety</HI> has here
got the better of my <HI>philo&s;ophy,</HI> I &s;hall &s;upport
my opinion, if it needs any &s;upport, by a very
great authority. I might cite all the divines al|mo&s;t,
from the foundation of Chri&s;tianity, who
have ever treated of this or any other theological
&s;ubject: But I &s;hall confine my&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, to
one equally celebrated for piety and philo&s;ophy.
It is Father MALEBRANCHE, who, I remember,
thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Recherche de la Verit&eacute; liv. 3. chap. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>. <Q>One ought not &s;o
much (&s;ays he) to call God a &s;pirit, in order
to expre&s;s po&s;itively what he is, as in order to
&s;ignify that he is not matter. He is a Being
infinitely perfect: Of this we cannot doubt.
But in the &s;ame manner as we ought not to i|magine,
even &s;uppo&s;ing him corporeal, that he
<PB N="23" REF="25">
is clothed with a human body, as the AN|THROPOMORPHITES
a&s;&s;erted, under colour
that that figure was the mo&s;t perfect of any;
&s;o neither ought we to imagine, that the Spirit
of God has human ideas, or bears any re&s;em|blance
to our &s;pirit; under colour that we
know nothing more perfect than a human mind.
We ought rather to believe, that as he com|prehends
the perfections of matter without be|ing
material........he comprehends al&s;o
the perfections of created &s;pirits, without be|ing
&s;pirit, in the manner we conceive &s;pirit:
That his true name is, <HI>He that is,</HI> or in other
words, Being without re&s;triction, All Being,
the Being infinite and univer&s;al.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;o great an authority, DEMEA, replied
PHILO, as that which you have produced, and
a thou&s;and more, which you might produce, it
would appear ridiculous in me to add my &s;enti|ment,
or expre&s;s my approbation of your doc|trine.
But furely, where rea&s;onable men treat
the&s;e &s;ubjects, the que&s;tion can never be concern|ing
the <HI>Being,</HI> but only the <HI>Nature</HI> of the
Deity. The &s;ormer truth, as you well ob&s;erve,
is unque&s;tionable and &s;elf-evident. Nothing ex|i&s;ts
without a cau&s;e; and the original cau&s;e of
this univer&s;e (whatever it be) we call GOD;
and piou&s;ly a&s;cribe to him every &s;pecies of perfec|tion.
Whoever &s;cruples this fundamental truth,
de&s;erves every puni&s;hment, which can be inflicted
among philo&s;ophers, to wit, the greate&s;t ridicule,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
contempt and di&s;approbation. But as all perfec|tion
is entirely relative, we ought never to ima|gine,
that we comprehend the attributes of this
divine Being, or to &s;uppo&s;e, that his perfections
have any analogy or likene&s;s to the perfections
of a human creature. Wi&s;dom, Thought, De|&s;ign,
Knowledge; the&s;e we ju&s;tly a&s;cribe to him;
becau&s;e the&s;e words are honourable among men,
and we have no other language or other concep|tions,
by which we can expre&s;s our adoration of
him. But let us beware, left we think, that
our ideas any wi&s;e corre&s;pond to his perfections,
or that his attributes have any re&s;emblance to
the&s;e qualities among men. He is infinitely &s;u|perior
to our limited view and comprehen&s;ion;
and is more the object of wor&s;hip in the temple
than of di&s;putation in the &s;chools.</P>
<P>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, there
is no need of having recour&s;e to that affected
&s;ceptici&s;m, &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to you, in order to come
at this determination. Our ideas reach no far|ther
than our experience: We have no experi|ence
of divine attributes and operations: I need
not conclude my &s;yllogi&s;m: You can draw the
inference your&s;elf. And it is a plea&s;ure to me
(and I hope to you too) that ju&s;t rea&s;oning and
&s;ound piety here concur in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion,
and both of them e&s;tabli&s;h the adorably my&s;te|rious
and incomprehen&s;ible nature of the Supreme
Being.</P>
<P>Not to lo&s;e any time in circumlocutions, &s;aid
<PB N="25" REF="27">
CLEANTHES, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to DEMEA,
much le&s;s in replying to the pious declamations of
PHILO; I &s;hall briefly explain how I conceive
this matter. Look round the world: contem|plate
the whole and every part of it: You will
find it to be nothing but one great machine,
&s;ubdivided into an infinite number of le&s;&s;er ma|chines,
which again admit of &s;ubdivi&s;ions, to a
degree beyond what human &s;en&s;es and faculties
can trace and explain. All the&s;e various ma|chines,
and even their mo&s;t minute parts, are
adju&s;ted to each other with an accuracy, which
ravi&s;hes into admiration all men, who have ever
contemplated them. The curious adapting of
means to ends, throughout all nature, re&s;embles
exactly, though it much exceeds, the produc|tions
of human contrivance; of human de&s;ign,
thought, wi&s;dom, and intelligence. Since there|fore
the effects re&s;emble each other, we are
led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the
cau&s;es al&s;o re&s;emble; and that the Author of Na|ture
is &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the mind of man;
though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much larger faculties, pro|portioned
to the grandeur of the work, which
he has executed. By this argument <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI>
and by this argument alone, do we prove at once
the exi&s;tence of a Deity, and his &s;imilarity to
human mind and intelligence.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be &s;o free, CLEANTHES, &s;aid DEMEA,
as to tell you, that from the beginning I could
not approve of your conclu&s;ion concerning the
<PB N="26" REF="28">
&s;imilarity of the Deity to men; &s;till le&s;s can I ap|prove
of the mediums, by which you endeavour
to e&s;tabli&s;h it. What! No demon&s;tration of the
Being of a God! No ab&s;tract arguments! No
proofs <HI>a priori!</HI> Are the&s;e, which have hitherto
been &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by philo&s;ophers, all fallacy,
all &s;ophi&s;m? Can we reach no farther in this &s;ubject
than experience and probability? I will not &s;ay,
that this is betraying the cau&s;e of a Deity: But
&s;urely, by this affected candor, you give advan|tages
to Athei&s;ts, which they never could obtain,
by the mere dint of argument and rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>What I chiefly &s;cruple in this &s;ubject, &s;aid
PHILO, is not &s;o much, that all religious argu|ments
are by CLEANTHES reduced to experience,
as that they appear not to be even the mo&s;t cer|tain
and irrefragable of that inferior kind. That
a &s;tone will fall, that fire will burn, that the
earth has &s;olidity, we have ob&s;erved a thou&s;and
and a thou&s;and times; and when any new in|&s;tance
of this nature is pre&s;ented, we draw with|out
he&s;itation the accu&s;tomed inference. The
exact &s;imilarity of the ca&s;es gives us a perfect a&s;|&s;urance
of a &s;imilar event; and a &s;tronger evi|dence
is never de&s;ired nor &s;ought after. But
where-ever you depart, in the lea&s;t, from the
&s;imilarity of the ca&s;es, you dimini&s;h proportion|ably
the evidence; and may at la&s;t bring it to a
very weak <HI>analogy,</HI> which is confe&s;&s;edly liable to
error and uncertainty. After having experienced
the circulation of the blood in human creatures,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
we make no doubt, that it takes place in TITIUS
and MAEVIUS: But from its circulation in frogs
and fi&s;hes, it is only a pre&s;umption, though a
&s;trong one, from analogy, that it takes place in
men and other animals. The analogical rea&s;on|ing
is much weaker, when we infer the circula|tion
of the &s;ap in vegetables from our experience,
that the blood circulates in animals; and tho&s;e,
who ha&s;tily followed that imperfect analogy, are
found, by more accurate experiments, to have
been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>If we &s;ee a hou&s;e, CLEANTHES, we conclude,
with the greate&s;t certainty, that it had an archi|tect
or builder; becau&s;e this is preci&s;ely that
&s;pecies of effect, which we have experienced to
proceed from that &s;pecies of cau&s;e. But &s;urely
you will not affirm, that the univer&s;e bears &s;uch
a re&s;emblance to a hou&s;e, that we can with the
&s;ame certainty infer a &s;imilar cau&s;e, or that the
analogy is here entire and perfect. The di&s;&s;i|militude
is &s;o &s;triking, that the utmo&s;t you can
here pretend to is a gue&s;s, a conjecture, a pre|&s;umption
concerning a &s;imilar cau&s;e; and how
that preten&s;ion will be received in the world, I
leave you to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>It would &s;urely be very ill received, replied
CLEANTHES; and I &s;hould be de&s;ervedly bla|med
and dete&s;ted, did I allow, that the proofs
of a Deity amounted to no more than a gue&s;s or
conjecture. But is the whole adju&s;tment of
means to ends in a hou&s;e and in the univer&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="30">
&s;o &s;light a re&s;emblance? The oeconomy of final
cau&s;es? The order, proportion, and arrange|ment
of every part? Steps of a &s;tair are plainly
contrived, that human legs may u&s;e them in
mounting; and this inference is certain and in|fallible.
Human legs are al&s;o contrived for walk|ing
and mounting; and this inference, I allow,
is not altogether &s;o certain, becau&s;e of the di&s;&s;imi|larity
which you remark; but does it, therefore,
de&s;erve the name only of pre&s;umption or con|jecture?</P>
<P>Good God! cried DEMEA, interrupting him,
where are we? Zealous defenders of religion al|low,
that the proofs of a Deity fall &s;hort of
perfect evidence! And you, PHILO, on who&s;e
a&s;&s;i&s;tance I depended, in proving the adorable
my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of the Divine Nature, do you a&s;&s;ent
to all the&s;e extravagant opinions of CLEANTHES?
For what other name can I give them? Or why
&s;pare my cen&s;ure, when &s;uch principles are ad|vanced,
&s;upported by &s;uch an authority, before
&s;o young a man as PAMPHILUS?</P>
<P>You &s;eem not to apprehend, replied PHILO,
that I argue with CLEANTHES in his own way;
and by &s;howing him the dangerous con&s;equences
of his tenets, hope at la&s;t to reduce him to our
opinion. But what &s;ticks mo&s;t with you, I ob|&s;erve,
is the repre&s;entation which CLEANTHES
has made of the argument <HI>a po&s;teriori;</HI> and
finding, that that argument is likely to e&s;cape your
hold and vani&s;h into air, you think it &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
that you can &s;carcely believe it to be &s;et in its
true light. Now, however much I may di&s;&s;ent,
in other re&s;pects, from the dangerous principles
of CLEANTHES, I mu&s;t allow, that he has fair|ly
repre&s;ented that argument; and I &s;hall endea|vour
&s;o to &s;tate the matter to you, that you will
entertain no farther &s;cruples with regard to it.</P>
<P>Were a man to ab&s;tract from every thing
which he knows or has &s;een, he would be altoge|ther
incapable, merely from his own ideas, to
determine what kind of &s;cene the univer&s;e mu&s;t
be, or to give the preference to one &s;tate or &s;i|tuation
of things above another. For as nothing
which he clearly conceives, could be e&s;teemed
impo&s;&s;ible or implying a contradiction, every chi|mera
of his fancy would be upon an equal foot|ing;
nor could he a&s;&s;ign any ju&s;t rea&s;on, why he
adheres to one idea or &s;y&s;tem, and rejects the
others, which are equally po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Again; after he opens his eyes, and contem|plates
the world, as it really is, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for him, at fir&s;t, to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e of
any one event; much le&s;s, of the whole of things
or of the univer&s;e. He might &s;et his Fancy a
rambling; and &s;he might bring him in an infinite
variety of reports and repre&s;entations. The&s;e
would all be po&s;&s;ible; but being all equally po&s;|&s;ible,
he would never, of him&s;elf, give a &s;atisfac|tory
account for his preferring one of them to the
re&s;t. Experience alone can point out to him the
true cau&s;e of any phenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
Now according to this method of rea&s;oning,
DEMEA, it follows (and is, indeed, tacitly al|lowed
by CLEANTHES him&s;elf) that order, ar|rangement,
or the adju&s;tment of final cau&s;es is
not, of it&s;elf, any proof of de&s;ign; but only &s;o
far as it has been experienced to proceed from
that principle. For aught we can know <HI>a priori,</HI>
matter may contain the &s;ource or &s;pring of order
originally, within it&s;elf, as well as mind does;
and there is no more difficulty in conceiving,
that the &s;everal elements, from an internal un|known
cau&s;e, may fall into the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ar|rangement,
than to conceive that their ideas, in
the great, univer&s;al mind, from a like internal,
unknown cau&s;e, fall into that arrangement. The
equal po&s;&s;ibility of both the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions is al|lowed.
But by experience we find, (according
to CLEANTHES) that there is a difference be|tween
them. Throw &s;everal pieces of &s;teel to|gether,
without &s;hape or form; they will never
arrange them&s;elves &s;o as to compo&s;e a watch:
Stone, and mortar, and wood, without an ar|chitect,
never erect a hou&s;e. But the ideas in
a human mind, we &s;ee, by an unknown, inex|plicable
oeconomy, arrange them&s;elves &s;o as to
form the plan of a watch or hou&s;e. Experience,
therefore, proves, that there is an original prin|ciple
of order in mind, not in matter. From
&s;imilar effects we infer &s;imilar cau&s;es. The ad|ju&s;tment
of means to ends is alike in the univer&s;e,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
as in a machine of human contrivance. The
cau&s;es, therefore, mu&s;t be re&s;embling.</P>
<P>I was from the beginning &s;candali&s;ed, I mu&s;t
own, with this re&s;emblance, which is a&s;&s;erted,
between the Deity and human creatures; and
mu&s;t conceive it to imply &s;uch a degradation of
the Supreme Being as no found Thei&s;t could en|dure.
With your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, therefore, DEMEA,
I &s;hall endeavour to defend what you ju&s;tly call
the adorable my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of the Divine Nature,
and &s;hall refute this rea&s;oning of CLEANTHES;
provided he allows, that I have made a fair re|pre&s;entation
of it.</P>
<P>When CLEANTHES had a&s;&s;ented, PHILO, af|ter
a &s;hort pau&s;e, proceeded in the following man|ner.</P>
<P>That all inferences, CLEANTHES, concerning
fact, are founded on experience, and that all ex|perimental
rea&s;onings are founded on the &s;uppo|&s;ition,
that &s;imilar cau&s;es prove &s;imilar effects,
and &s;imilar effects &s;imilar cau&s;es; I &s;hall not, at
pre&s;ent, much di&s;pute with you. But ob&s;erve, I
intreat you, with what extreme caution all ju&s;t
rea&s;oners proceed in the transferring of experiments
to &s;imilar ca&s;es. Unle&s;s the ca&s;es be exactly &s;i|milar,
they repo&s;e no perfect confidence in ap|plying
their pa&s;t ob&s;ervation to any particular phe|nomenon.
Every alteration of circum&s;tances oc|ca&s;ions
a doubt concerning the event; and it re|quires
new experiments to prove certainly, that
the new circum&s;tances are of no moment or im|portance.
<PB N="32" REF="34">
A change in bulk, &s;ituation, arrange|ment,
age, di&s;po&s;ition of the air, or &s;urround|ing
bodies; any of the&s;e particulars may be at|tended
with the mo&s;t unexpected con&s;equences:
And unle&s;s the objects be quite familiar to us, it
is the highe&s;t temerity to expect with a&s;&s;urance,
after any of the&s;e changes, an event &s;imilar to
that which before fell under our ob&s;ervation. The
&s;low and deliberate &s;teps of philo&s;ophers, here, if
any where, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the precipi|tate
march of the vulgar, who, hurried on by
the &s;malle&s;t &s;imilitude, are incapable of all di&s;cern|ment
or con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But can you think, CLEANTHES, that your
u&s;ual phlegm and philo&s;ophy have been pre&s;erved
in &s;o wide a &s;tep as you have taken, when you
compared to the univer&s;e hou&s;es, &s;hips, furniture,
machines; and from their &s;imilarity in &s;ome
circum&s;tances inferred a &s;imilarity in their cau&s;es?
Thought, de&s;ign, intelligence, &s;uch as we di&s;co|ver
in men and other animals, is no more than
one of the &s;prings and principles of the univer&s;e,
as well as heat or cold, attraction or repul&s;ion,
and a hundred others, which fall under daily ob|&s;ervation.
It is an active cau&s;e, by which &s;ome
particular parts of nature, we find, produce al|terations
on other parts. But can a conclu&s;ion,
with any propriety, be transferred from parts to
the whole? Does not the great di&s;proportion
bar all compari&s;on and inference? From ob&s;er|ving
the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing
<PB N="33" REF="35">
concerning the generation of a man? Would the
manner of a leaf's blowing, even though per|fectly
known, afford us any in&s;truction concern|ing
the vegetation of a tree?</P>
<P>But allowing that we were to take the <HI>opera|tions</HI>
of one part of nature upon another for the
foundation of our judgement concerning the <HI>ori|gin</HI>
of the whole (which never can be admitted)
yet why &s;elect &s;o minute, &s;o weak, &s;o bounded a
principle as the rea&s;on and de&s;ign of animals is
found to be upon this planet? What peculiar
privilege has this little agitation of the brain which
we call <HI>thought,</HI> that we mu&s;t thus make it the
model of the whole univer&s;e? Our partiality in
our own favour does indeed pre&s;ent it on all oc|ca&s;ions;
but &s;ound philo&s;ophy ought carefully to
guard again&s;t &s;o natural an illu&s;ion.</P>
<P>So far from admitting, continued PHILO, that
the operations of a part can afford us any ju&s;t
conclu&s;ion concerning the origin of the whole, I
will not allow any one part to form a rule for an|other
part, if the latter be very remote from the
former. Is there any rea&s;onable ground to con|clude,
that the inhabitants of other planets po&s;|&s;e&s;s
thought, intelligence, rea&s;on, or any thing
&s;imilar to the&s;e faculties in men? When Nature
has &s;o extremely diver&s;ified her manner of opera|tion
in this &s;mall globe; can we imagine, that
&s;he ince&s;&s;antly copies her&s;elf throughout &s;o im|men&s;e
a univer&s;e? And if thought, as we may
well &s;uppo&s;e, be confined merely to this narrow
<PB N="34" REF="36">
corner, and has even there &s;o limited a &s;phere of
action; with what propriety can we a&s;&s;ign it for
the original cau&s;e of all things? The narrow
views of a pea&s;ant, who makes his dome&s;tic oe|conomy
the rule for the government of kingdoms,
is in compari&s;on a pardonable &s;ophi&s;m.</P>
<P>But were we ever &s;o much a&s;&s;ured, that a
thought and rea&s;on, re&s;embling the human, were
to be found throughout the whole univer&s;e, and
were its activity el&s;ewhere va&s;tly greater and more
commanding than it appears in this globe: yet I
cannot &s;ee, why the operations of a world, con|&s;tituted,
arranged, adju&s;ted, can with any pro|priety
be extended to a world, which is in its
embryo-&s;tate, and is advancing towards that con|&s;titution
and arrangement. By ob&s;ervation, we
know &s;omewhat of the oeconomy, action, and
nouri&s;hment of a fini&s;hed animal; but we mu&s;t
transfer with great caution that ob&s;ervation to the
growth of a foetus in the womb, and &s;till more,
to the formation of an animalcule in the loins of
its male parent. Nature, we find, even from
our limited experience, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an infinite num|ber
of &s;prings and principles, which ince&s;&s;antly
di&s;cover them&s;elves on every change of her po&s;i|tion
and &s;ituation. And what new and unknown
principles would actuate her in &s;o new and un|known
a &s;ituation, as that of the formation of a
univer&s;e, we cannot, without the utmo&s;t temerity,
pretend to determine.</P>
<P>A very &s;mall part of this great &s;y&s;tem, during
<PB N="35" REF="37">
a very &s;hort time, is very imperfectly di&s;covered
to us: and do we thence pronounce deci&s;ively
concerning the origin of the whole?</P>
<P>Admirable conclu&s;ion! Stone, wood, brick,
iron, bra&s;s, have not, at this time, in this minute
globe of earth, an order or arrangement without
human art and contrivance: therefore the univer&s;e
could not originally attain its order and arrange|ment,
without &s;omething &s;imilar to human art.
But is a part of nature a rule for another part
very wide of the former? Is it a rule for the
whole? Is a very &s;mall part a rule for the uni|ver&s;e?
Is nature in one &s;ituation, a certain rule
for nature in another &s;ituation, va&s;tly different
from the former?</P>
<P>And can you blame me, CLEANTHES, if I
here imitate the prudent re&s;erve of SIMONIDES,
who, according to the noted &s;tory, being a&s;ked
by HIERO, <HI>What God was?</HI> de&s;ired a day to
think of it, and then two days more; and after
that manner continually prolonged the term, with|out
ever bringing in his definition or de&s;cription?
Could you even blame me, if I had an&s;wered at
fir&s;t, <HI>that I did not know,</HI> and was &s;en&s;ible that
this &s;ubject lay va&s;tly beyond the reach of my fa|culties?
You might cry out &s;ceptic and rallier as
much as you plea&s;ed: but having found, in &s;o
many other &s;ubjects, much more familiar, the
imperfections and even contradictions of human
rea&s;on, I never &s;hould expect any &s;ucce&s;s from its
feeble conjectures, in a &s;ubject, &s;o &s;ublime, and
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;o remote from the &s;phere of our ob&s;ervation.
When two <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of objects have always been
ob&s;erved to be conjoined together, I can <HI>infer,</HI>
by cu&s;tom, the exi&s;tence of one, where-ever I
<HI>&s;ee</HI> the exi&s;tence of the other: and this I call an
argument from experience. But how this argu|ment
can have place, where the objects, as in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, are &s;ingle, individual, without pa|rallel,
or &s;pecific re&s;emblance, may be difficult to
explain. And will any man tell me with a &s;erious
countenance, that an orderly univer&s;e mu&s;t ari&s;e
from &s;ome thought and art, like the human; be|cau&s;e
we have experience of it? To a&s;certain
this rea&s;oning, it were requi&s;ite, that we had ex|perience
of the origin of worlds; and it is not
&s;ufficient &s;urely, that we have &s;een &s;hips and cities
ari&s;e from human art and contrivance.........</P>
<P>PHILO was proceeding in this vehement man|ner,
&s;omewhat between je&s;t and earne&s;t, as it ap|peared
to me; when he ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;igns of
impatience in CLEANTHES, and then immediate|ly
&s;topped &s;hort. What I had to &s;ugge&s;t, &s;aid
CLEANTHES, is only that you would not abu&s;e
terms, or make u&s;e of popular expre&s;&s;ions to &s;ub|vert
philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings. You know, that
the vulgar often di&s;tingui&s;h rea&s;on from experience,
even where the que&s;tion relates only to matter of
fact and exi&s;tence; though it is found, where
that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> is properly analyzed, that it is nothing
but a &s;pecies of experience. To prove by ex|perience
the origin of the univer&s;e from mind is
<PB N="37" REF="39">
not more contrary to common &s;peech than to
prove the motion of the earth from the &s;ame
principle. And a caviller might rai&s;e all the &s;ame
objections to the COPERNICAN &s;y&s;tem, which
you have urged again&s;t my rea&s;onings. Have
you other earths, might he &s;ay, which you have
&s;een to move? Have.</P>
<P>Yes! cried PHILO, interrupting him, we have
other earths. Is not the moon another earth,
which we &s;ee to turn round its centre? Is not
Venus another earth, where we ob&s;erve the &s;ame
phenomenon? Are not the revolutions of the
&s;un al&s;o a confirmation, from analogy, of the
&s;ame theory? All the planets, are they not
earths, which revolve about the &s;un? Are not
the &s;atellites moons, which move round Jupiter
and Saturn, and along with the&s;e primary planets,
round the &s;un? The&s;e analogies and re&s;em|blances,
with others, which I have not mention|ed,
are the &s;ole proofs of the COPERNICAN &s;y|&s;tem:
and to you it belongs to con&s;ider, whether
you have any analogies of the &s;ame kind to &s;up|port
your theory.</P>
<P>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, the mo|dern
&s;y&s;tem of a&s;tronomy is now &s;o much recei|ved
by all enquirers, and has become &s;o e&s;&s;ential
a part even of our earlie&s;t education, that we are
not commonly very &s;crupulous in examining the
rea&s;ons, upon which it is founded. It is now be|come
a matter of mere curio&s;ity to &s;tudy the fir&s;t
writers on that &s;ubject, who had the full force of
<PB N="38" REF="40">
prejudice to encounter, and were obliged to turn
their arguments on every &s;ide, in order to render
them popular and convincing. But if we peru&s;e
GALILAEO's famous Dialogues concerning the &s;y|&s;tem
of the world, we &s;hall find, that that great
genius, one of the &s;ublime&s;t that ever exi&s;ted,
fir&s;t bent all his endeavours to prove, that there
was no foundation for the di&s;tinction commonly
made between elementary and cele&s;tial &s;ub&s;tances.
The &s;chools, proceeding from the illu&s;ions of
&s;en&s;e, had carried this di&s;tinction very far; and
had e&s;tabli&s;hed the latter &s;ub&s;tances to be ingene|rable,
incorruptible, unalterable, impa&s;&s;able; and
had a&s;&s;igned all the oppo&s;ite qualities to the for|mer.
But GALILAEO, beginning with the moon,
proved its &s;imilarity in every particular to the
earth; its convex figure, its natural darkne&s;s
when not illuminated, its den&s;ity, its di&s;tinction
into &s;olid and liquid, the variations of its pha&s;es,
the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon,
their mutual eclip&s;es, the inequalities of the lunar
&s;urface, &amp;c. After many in&s;tances of this kind,
with regard to all the planets, men plainly &s;aw,
that the&s;e bodies became proper objects of expe|rience;
and that the &s;imilarity of their nature en|abled
us to extend the &s;ame arguments and phe|nomena
from one to the other.</P>
<P>In this cautious proceeding of the a&s;tronomers,
you may read your own condemnation, CLEAN|THES;
or rather may &s;ee, that the &s;ubject in which
you are engaged exceeds all human rea&s;on and
<PB N="39" REF="41">
enquiry. Can you pretend to &s;how any &s;uch &s;i|milarity
between the fabric of a hou&s;e, and the
generation of a univer&s;e? Have you ever &s;een
Nature in any &s;uch &s;ituation as re&s;embles the fir&s;t
arrangement of the elements? Have worlds ever
been formed under your eye? and have you had
lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the whole progre&s;s of the pheno|menon,
from the fir&s;t appearance of order to its
final con&s;ummation? If you have, then cite
your experience, and deliver your theory.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>HOW the mo&s;t ab&s;urd argument, replied
CLEANTHES, in the hands of a man of ingenui|ty
and invention, may acquire an air of probabi|lity!
Are you not aware, PHILO, that it became
nece&s;&s;ary for COPERNICUS and his fir&s;t di&s;ciples
to prove the &s;imilarity of the terre&s;trial and ce|le&s;tial
matter; becau&s;e &s;everal philo&s;ophers, blind|ed
by old &s;y&s;tems, and &s;upported by &s;ome &s;en&s;ible
appearances, had denied this &s;imilarity? But that
it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, that Thei&s;ts &s;hould
prove the &s;imilarity of the works of Nature to
tho&s;e of Art; becau&s;e this &s;imilarity is &s;elf-evident
and undeniable? The &s;ame matter, a like form:
what more is requi&s;ite to &s;how an analogy between
their cau&s;es, and to a&s;certain the origin of all
things from a divine purpo&s;e and intention? Your
objections, I mu&s;t freely tell you, are no better
<PB N="40" REF="42">
than the ab&s;tru&s;e cavils of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part III.</NOTE> who
denied motion; and ought to be refuted in the
&s;ame manner, by illu&s;trations, examples, and in|&s;tances,
rather than by &s;erious argument and phi|lo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, that an articulate voice
were heard in the clouds, much louder and more
melodious than any which human art could ever
reach: Suppo&s;e, that this voice were extended in
the &s;ame in&s;tant over all nations, and &s;poke to
each nation in its own language and dialect: Sup|po&s;e,
that the words delivered not only contain a
ju&s;t &s;en&s;e and meaning, but convey &s;ome in&s;truc|tion
altogether worthy of a benevolent being, &s;u|perior
to mankind: could you po&s;&s;ibly he&s;itate a
moment concerning the cau&s;e of this voice? and
mu&s;t you not in&s;tantly a&s;cribe it to &s;ome de&s;ign or
purpo&s;e? Yet I cannot &s;ee but all the &s;ame ob|jections
(if they merit that appellation) which lie
again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of Thei&s;m, may al&s;o be produ|ced
again&s;t this inference.</P>
<P>Might you not &s;ay, that all conclu&s;ions concern|ing
fact were founded on experience: that when
we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and
thence infer a man, it is only the re&s;emblance of
the effects, which leads us to conclude that there
is a like re&s;emblance in the cau&s;e: but that this
extraordinary voice, by its loudne&s;s, extent, and
flexibility to all languages, bears &s;o little analogy
to any human voice, that we have no rea&s;on to
&s;uppo&s;e any analogy in their cau&s;es: and con&s;e|quently,
<PB N="41" REF="43">
that a rational, wi&s;e, coherent &s;peech
proceeded, you knew not whence, from &s;ome
accidental whi&s;tling of the winds, not from any
divine rea&s;on or intelligence? You &s;ee clearly
your own objections in the&s;e cavils; and I hope
too, you &s;ee clearly, that they cannot po&s;&s;ibly
have more force in the one ca&s;e than in the other.</P>
<P>But to bring the ca&s;e &s;till nearer the pre&s;ent one
of the univer&s;e, I &s;hall make two &s;uppo&s;itions,
which imply not any ab&s;urdity or impo&s;&s;ibility.
Suppo&s;e, that there is a natural, univer&s;al, inva|riable
language, common to every individual of
human race, and that books are natural produc|tions,
which perpetuate them&s;elves in the &s;ame
manner with animals and vegetables, by de&s;cent
and propagation. Several expre&s;&s;ions of our pa&s;|&s;ions
contain a univer&s;al language: all brute ani|mals
have a natural &s;peech, which, however li|mited,
is very intelligible to their own &s;pecies.
And as there are infinitely fewer parts and le&s;s
contrivance in the fine&s;t compo&s;ition of eloquence,
than in the coar&s;e&s;t organized body, the propaga|tion
of an <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Aeneid</HI> is an ea&s;ier &s;uppo&s;i|tion
than that of any plant or animal.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, that you enter into your li|brary,
thus peopled by natural volumes, contain|ing
the mo&s;t refined rea&s;on and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite
beauty: could you po&s;&s;ibly open one of them,
and doubt, that its original cau&s;e bore the &s;trong|e&s;t
analogy to mind and intelligence? When it
rea&s;ons and di&s;cour&s;es; when it expo&s;tulates, ar|gues,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
and enforces its views and topics; when it
applies &s;ometimes to the pure intellect, &s;ometimes
to the affections; when it collects, di&s;po&s;es, and
adorns every con&s;ideration &s;uited to the &s;ubject:
could you per&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting, that all this, at the
bottom, had really no meaning, and that the fir&s;t
formation of this volume in the loins of its origi|nal
parent proceeded not from thought and de|&s;ign?
Your ob&s;tinacy, I know, reaches not that
degree of firmne&s;s: even your &s;ceptical play and
wantonne&s;s would be aba&s;hed at &s;o glaring an ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>But if there be any difference, PHILO, between
this &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e and the real one of the univer&s;e,
it is all to the advantage of the latter. The ana|tomy
of an animal affords many &s;tronger in&s;tances
of de&s;ign than the peru&s;al of LIVY or TACI|TUS:
and any objection which you &s;tart in the
former ca&s;e, by carrying me back to &s;o unu&s;ual
and extraordinary a &s;cene as the fir&s;t formation
of worlds, the &s;ame objection has place on the
&s;uppo&s;ition of our vegetating library. Chu&s;e,
then, your party, PHILO, without ambiguity or
eva&s;ion: a&s;&s;ert either that a rational volume is no
proof of a rational cau&s;e, or admit of a &s;imilar
cau&s;e to all the works of nature.</P>
<P>Let me here ob&s;erve too, continued CLEAN|THES,
that this religious argument, in&s;tead of
being weakened by that &s;ceptici&s;m, &s;o much af|fected
by you, rather acquires force from it,
and becomes more firm and undi&s;puted. To
<PB N="43" REF="45">
exclude all argument or rea&s;oning of every kind
is either affectation or madne&s;s. The declared
profe&s;&s;ion of every rea&s;onable &s;ceptic is only to
reject ab&s;tru&s;e, remote and refined arguments;
to adhere to common &s;en&s;e and the plain in&s;tincts
of nature; and to a&s;&s;ent, where-ever any rea&s;ons
&s;trike him with &s;o full a force, that he cannot,
without the greate&s;t violence, prevent it. Now
the arguments for Natural Religion are plainly
of this kind; and nothing but the mo&s;t perver&s;e,
ob&s;tinate metaphy&s;ics can reject them. Con&s;ider,
anatomize the eye: Survey its &s;tructure and con|trivance;
and tell me, from your own feeling,
if the idea of a contriver does not immediately
flow in upon you with a force like that of &s;en&s;a|tion.
The mo&s;t obvious conclu&s;ion &s;urely is in
favour of de&s;ign; and it requires time, reflection
and &s;tudy to &s;ummon up tho&s;e frivolous, though
ab&s;tru&s;e objections, which can &s;upport Infide|lity.
Who can behold the male and female of
each &s;pecies, the corre&s;pondence of their parts
and in&s;tincts, their pa&s;&s;ions and whole cour&s;e of
life before and after generation, but mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible,
that the propagation of the &s;pecies is in|tended
by Nature? Millions and millions of &s;uch
in&s;tances pre&s;ent them&s;elves through every part of
the univer&s;e; and no language can convey a
more intelligible, irre&s;i&s;tible meaning, than the
curious adju&s;tment of final cau&s;es. To what de|gree,
therefore, of blind dogmati&s;m mu&s;t one
<PB N="44" REF="46">
have attained, to reject &s;uch natural and &s;uch
convincing arguments?</P>
<P>Some beauties in writing we may meet with,
which &s;eem contrary to rules, and which gain
the affections, and animate the imagination, in
oppo&s;ition to all the precepts of critici&s;m, and to
the authority of the e&s;tabli&s;hed ma&s;ters of art.
And if the argument for Thei&s;m be, as you pre|tend,
contradictory to the principles of logic;
its univer&s;al, its irre&s;i&s;tible influence proves clear|ly,
that there may be arguments of a like irre|gular
nature. Whatever cavils may be urged;
an orderly world, as well as a coherent, articu|late
&s;peech, will &s;till be received as an inconte&s;t|able
proof of de&s;ign and intention.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, I own, that the religious
arguments have not their due influence on an ig|norant
&s;avage and barbarian; not becau&s;e they
are ob&s;cure and difficult, but becau&s;e he never
a&s;ks him&s;elf any que&s;tion with regard to them.
Whence ari&s;es the curious &s;tructure of an ani|mal?
From the copulation of its parents. And
the&s;e whence? From <HI>their</HI> parents? A few re|moves
&s;et the objects at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that to
him they are lo&s;t in darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion; nor
is he actuated by any curio&s;ity to trace them
farther. But this is neither dogmati&s;m nor &s;cep|tici&s;m,
but &s;tupidity; a &s;tate of mind very differ|ent
from your &s;ifting, inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition, my
ingenious friend. You can trace cau&s;es from ef|fects:
You can compare the mo&s;t di&s;tant and
<PB N="45" REF="47">
remote objects: and your greate&s;t errors proceed
not from barrenne&s;s of thought and invention,
but from too luxuriant a fertility, which &s;uppre&s;&s;es
your natural good &s;en&s;e, by a profu&s;ion of un|nece&s;&s;ary
&s;cruples and objections.</P>
<P>Here I could ob&s;erve, HERMIPPUS, that PHILO
was a little embarra&s;&s;ed and confounded: But
while he he&s;itated in delivering an an&s;wer, luckily
for him, DEMEA broke in upon the di&s;cour&s;e,
and &s;aved his countenance.</P>
<P>Your in&s;tance, CLEANTHES, &s;aid he, drawn
from books and language, being familiar, has,
I confe&s;s, &s;o much more force on that account;
but is there not &s;ome danger too in this very
circum&s;tance; and may it not render us pre&s;ump|tuous,
by making us imagine we comprehend
the Deity, and have &s;ome adequate idea of his
nature and attributes? When I read a volume,
I enter into the mind and intention of the au|thor:
I become him, in a manner, for the in|&s;tant;
and have an immediate feeling and con|ception
of tho&s;e ideas, which revolved in his i|magination,
while employed in that compo&s;ition.
But &s;o near an approach we never &s;urely can
make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways.
His attributes are perfect, but incomprehen&s;ible.
And this volume of Nature contains a great and
inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible
di&s;cour&s;e or rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The ancient PLATONISTS, you know, were
the mo&s;t religious and devout of all the Pagan
<PB N="46" REF="48">
philo&s;ophers: yet many of them, particularly
PLOTINUS us, expre&s;sly declare, that intellect or
under&s;tanding is not to be a&s;cribed to the Deity,
and that our mo&s;t perfect wor&s;hip of him con&s;i&s;ts,
not in acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude
or love; but in a certain my&s;terious &s;elf-anni|hilation
or total extinction of all our faculties.
The&s;e ideas are, perhaps, too far &s;tretched; but
&s;till it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, by repre&s;ent|ing
the Deity as &s;o intelligible, and comprehen|&s;ible,
and &s;o &s;imilar to a human mind, we are
guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t narrow partiality,
and make our&s;elves the model of the whole uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>All the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of the human mind, grati|tude,
re&s;entment, love, friend&s;hip, approbation,
blame, pity, emulation, envy, have a plain re|ference
to the &s;tate and &s;ituation of man, and
are calculated for pre&s;erving the exi&s;tence, and
promoting the activity of &s;uch a being in &s;uch
circum&s;tances. It &s;eems therefore unrea&s;onable
to transfer &s;uch &s;entiments to a &s;upreme exi&s;tence,
or to &s;uppo&s;e him actuated by them; and the
phenomena, be&s;ides, of the univer&s;e will not &s;up|port
us in &s;uch a theory. All our <HI>ideas,</HI> derived
from the &s;en&s;es are confe&s;&s;edly fal&s;e and illu&s;ive;
and cannot, therefore, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have place
in a &s;upreme intelligence: And as the ideas of
internal &s;entiment, added to tho&s;e of the exter|nal
&s;en&s;es, compo&s;e the whole furniture of hu|man
under&s;tanding, we may conclude, that none
<PB N="47" REF="49">
of the <HI>materials</HI> of thought are in any re|&s;pect
&s;imilar in the human and in the divine
intelligence. Now as to the <HI>manner</HI> of think|ing;
how can we make any compari&s;on between
them, or &s;uppo&s;e them any wi&s;e re&s;embling?
Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting,
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive, and compounded; and were we to re|move
the&s;e circum&s;tances, we ab&s;olutely annihi|late
its e&s;&s;ence, and it would, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be
an abu&s;e of terms to apply to it the name of
thought or rea&s;on. At lea&s;t, if it appear more
pious and re&s;pectful (as it really is) &s;till to retain
the&s;e terms, when we mention the Supreme Be|ing,
we ought to acknowledge, that their mean|ing,
in that ca&s;e, is totally incomprehen&s;ible;
and that the infirmities of our nature do not per|mit
us to reach any ideas, which in the lea&s;t cor|re&s;pond
to the ineffable &s;ublimity of the divine
attributes.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems &s;trange to me, &s;aid CLEANTHES,
that you, DEMEA, who are &s;o &s;incere in the
cau&s;e of religion, &s;hould &s;till maintain the my&s;te|rious,
incomprehen&s;ible nature of the Deity, and
&s;hould in&s;i&s;t &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that he has no man|ner
of likene&s;s or re&s;emblance to human crea|tures.
The Deity, I can readily allow, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
many powers and attributes, of which we can
<PB N="48" REF="50">
have no comprehen&s;ion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part IV.</NOTE> But if our ideas, &s;o far
as they go, be not ju&s;t, and adequate, and cor|re&s;pondent
to his real nature, I know not what
there is in this &s;ubject worth in&s;i&s;ting on. Is
the name, without any meaning, of &s;uch mighty
importance? Or how do you MYSTICS, who
maintain the ab&s;olute incomprehen&s;ibility of the
Deity, differ from Sceptics or Athei&s;ts, who a&s;|&s;ert,
that the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all is unknown and
unintelligible? Their temerity mu&s;t be very
great, if, after rejecting the production by a
mind; I mean, a mind, re&s;embling the human
(for I know of no other) they pretend to a&s;&s;ign,
with certainty, any other &s;pecific, intelligible
cau&s;e: And their con&s;cience mu&s;t be very &s;cru|pulous
indeed, if they refu&s;e to call the univer&s;al,
unknown cau&s;e a God or Deity; and to be&s;tow
on him as many &s;ublime eulogies and unmeaning
epithets, as you &s;hall plea&s;e to require of them.</P>
<P>Who could imagine, replied DEMEA, that
CLEANTHES, the calm, philo&s;ophical CLEAN|THES,
would attempt to refute his antagoni&s;ts,
by affixing a nick-name to them; and like the
common bigots and inqui&s;itors of the age, have
recour&s;e to invective and declamation, in&s;tead of
rea&s;oning? Or does he not perceive, that the&s;e
topics are ea&s;ily retorted, and that ANTHRO|POMORPHITE
is an appellation as invidious,
and implies as dangerous con&s;equences, as the
epithet of MYSTIC, with which he has honoured
us? In reality, CLEANTHES, con&s;ider what it
<PB N="49" REF="51">
is you a&s;&s;ert, when you repre&s;ent the Deity as
&s;imilar to a human mind and under&s;tanding.
What is the &s;oul of man? A compo&s;ition of va|rious
faculties, pa&s;&s;ions, &s;entiments, ideas; uni|ted,
indeed, into one &s;elf or per&s;on, but &s;till di&s;|tinct
from each other. When it rea&s;ons, the
ideas, which are the parts of its di&s;cour&s;e, ar|range
them&s;elves in a certain form or order; which
is not pre&s;erved entire for a moment, but imme|diately
gives place to another arrangement. New
opinions, new pa&s;&s;ions, new affections, new feel|ings
ari&s;e, which continually diver&s;ify the mental
&s;cene, and produce in it the greate&s;t variety, and
mo&s;t rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion imaginable. How is this
compatible, with that perfect immutability and
&s;implicity, which all true Thei&s;ts a&s;cribe to the
Deity? By the &s;ame act, &s;ay they, he &s;ees pa&s;t,
pre&s;ent, and future: His love and his hatred, his
mercy and his ju&s;tice, are one individual opera|tion:
He is entire in every point of &s;pace; and
complete in every in&s;tant of duration. No &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
no change, no acqui&s;ition, no diminution.
What he is implies not in it any &s;hadow of di&s;|tinction
or diver&s;ity. And what he is, this mo|ment,
he ever has been, and ever will be, with|out
any new judgement, &s;entiment, or operation.
He &s;tands fixed in one &s;imple, perfect &s;tate; nor
can you ever &s;ay, with any propriety, that this act
of his is different from that other, or that this judge|ment
or idea has been lately formed, and will give
place, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to any different judgement or
idea.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
I can readily allow, &s;aid CLEANTHES, that
tho&s;e who maintain the perfect &s;implicity of the
Supreme Being, to the extent in which you have
explained it, are complete MYSTICS, and charge|able
with all the con&s;equences which I have drawn
from their opinion. They are, in a word, A|THEISTS,
without knowing it. For though it be
allowed, that the Deity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es attributes, of
which we have no comprehen&s;ion; yet ought we
never to a&s;cribe to him any attributes, which are
ab&s;olutely incompatible with that intelligent na|ture,
e&s;&s;ential to him. A mind, who&s;e acts and
&s;entiments and ideas are not di&s;tinct and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive;
one, that is wholly &s;imple, and totally im|mutable;
is a mind, which has no thought, no
rea&s;on, no will, no &s;entiment, no love, no ha|tred;
or in a word, is no mind at all. It is an
abu&s;e of terms to give it that appellation; and
we may as well &s;peak of limited exten&s;ion with|out
figure, or of number without compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Pray con&s;ider, &s;aid PHILO, whom you are at
pre&s;ent inveighing again&s;t. You are honouring
with the appellation of <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> all the &s;ound, or|thodox
divines almo&s;t, who have treated of this
&s;ubject; and you will, at la&s;t be, your&s;elf, found,
according to your reckoning, the only &s;ound
Thei&s;t in the world. But if idolaters be Athei&s;ts,
as, I think, may ju&s;tly be a&s;&s;erted, and Chri&s;tian
Theologians the &s;ame; what becomes of the ar|gument,
&s;o much celebrated, derived from the
univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
But becau&s;e I know you are not much &s;wayed
by names and authorities, I &s;hall endeavour to
&s;how you, a little more di&s;tinctly, the inconve|niencies
of that Anthropomorphi&s;m, which you
have embraced; and &s;hall prove, that there is
no ground to &s;uppo&s;e a plan of the world to be
formed in the divine mind, con&s;i&s;ting of di&s;tinct
ideas, differently arranged; in the &s;ame manner
as an architect forms in his head the plan of a
hou&s;e which he intends to execute.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y, I own, to &s;ee, what is gained
by this &s;uppo&s;ition, whether we judge of the
matter by <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or by <HI>Experience.</HI> We are
&s;till obliged to mount higher, in order to find
the cau&s;e of this cau&s;e, which you had a&s;&s;igned
as &s;atisfactory and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>If Rea&s;on (I mean ab&s;tract rea&s;on, derived from
enquiries <HI>a priori</HI>) be not alike mute with regard
to all que&s;tions concerning cau&s;e and effect; this
&s;entence at lea&s;t it will venture to pronounce,
That a mental world, or univer&s;e of ideas, requires
a cau&s;e as much, as does a material world, or u|niver&s;e
of objects; and if &s;imilar in its arrange|ment
mu&s;t require a &s;imilar cau&s;e. For what is
there in this &s;ubject, which &s;hould occa&s;ion a
different conclu&s;ion or inference? In an ab&s;tract
view, they are entirely alike; and no difficulty
attends the one &s;uppo&s;ition, which is not com|mon
to both of them.</P>
<P>Again, when we will needs force <HI>Experience</HI> to
pronounce &s;ome &s;entence, even on the&s;e &s;ubjects,
<PB N="52" REF="54">
which lie beyond her &s;phere; neither can &s;he
perceive any material difference in this particular,
between the&s;e two kinds of worlds, but finds
them to be governed by &s;imilar principles, and
to depend upon an equal variety of cau&s;es in their
operations. We have &s;pecimens in miniature of
both of them. Our own mind re&s;embles the one:
A vegetable or animal body the other. Let Ex|perience,
therefore, judge from the&s;e &s;amples.
Nothing &s;eems more delicate with regard to its
cau&s;es than thought; and as the&s;e cau&s;es never
operate in two per&s;ons after the &s;ame manner,
&s;o we never find two per&s;ons, who think ex|actly
alike. Nor indeed does the &s;ame per&s;on
think exactly alike at any two different periods of
time. A difference of age, of the di&s;po&s;ition of
his body, of weather, of food, of company, of
books, of pa&s;&s;ions; any of the&s;e particulars, or
others more minute, are &s;ufficient to alter the
curious machinery of thought, and communicate
to it very different movements and operations.
As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal
bodies are not more delicate in their motions,
nor depend upon a greater variety or more curi|ous
adju&s;tment of &s;prings and principles.</P>
<P>How therefore &s;hall we &s;atisfy our&s;elves con|cerning
the cau&s;e of that Being, whom you &s;up|po&s;e
the Author of Nature, or, according to
your &s;y&s;tem of Anthropomorphi&s;m, the ideal
world, into which you trace the material? Have
<PB N="53" REF="55">
we not the &s;ame rea&s;on to trace that ideal world
into another ideal world, or new intelligent prin|ciple?
But if we &s;top, and go no farther; why
go &s;o far? Why not &s;top at the material world?
How can we &s;atisfy our&s;elves without going on
<HI>in infinitum?</HI> And after all, what &s;atisfaction is
there in that infinite progre&s;&s;ion? Let us remem|ber
the &s;tory of the INDIAN philo&s;opher and his
elephant. It was never more applicable than to
the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. If the material world re&s;ts up|on
a &s;imilar ideal world, this ideal world mu&s;t re&s;t
upon &s;ome other; and &s;o on, without end. It
were better, therefore, never to look beyond the
pre&s;ent material world. By &s;uppo&s;ing it to con|tain
the principle of its order within it&s;elf, we
really a&s;&s;ert it to be God; and the &s;ooner we
arrive at that divine Being &s;o much the better.
When you go one &s;tep beyond the mundane &s;y|&s;tem,
you only excite an inqui&s;itive humour,
which it is impo&s;&s;ible ever to &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that the different ideas, which com|po&s;e
the rea&s;on of the Supreme Being, fall into
order, of them&s;elves, and by their own nature,
is really to talk without any preci&s;e meaning.
If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it
is not as good &s;en&s;e to &s;ay, that the parts of the
material world fall into order, of them&s;elves, and
by their own nature. Can the one opinion be
intelligible, while the other is not &s;o?</P>
<P>We have, indeed, experience of ideas, which
fall into order, of them&s;elves, and without any
<PB N="54" REF="56">
<HI>known</HI> cau&s;e: But, I am &s;ure, we have a much
larger experience of matter, which does the
&s;ame; as in all in&s;tances of generation and ve|getation,
where the accurate analy&s;is of the cau&s;e
exceeds all human comprehen&s;ion. We have
al&s;o experience of particular &s;y&s;tems of thought
and of matter, which have no order; of the fir&s;t,
in madne&s;s; of the &s;econd, in corruption. Why
then &s;hould we think, that order is more e&s;&s;en|tial
to one than the other? And if it requires a
cau&s;e in both, what do we gain by your &s;y&s;tem,
in tracing the univer&s;e of objects into a &s;imilar
univer&s;e of ideas? The fir&s;t &s;tep, which we make,
leads us on for ever. It were, therefore, wi&s;e
in us, to limit all our enquiries to the pre&s;ent
world, without looking farther. No &s;atisfaction
can ever be attained by the&s;e &s;peculations, which
&s;o far exceed the narrow bounds of human un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual with the PERIPATETICS, you
know, CLEANTHES, when the cau&s;e of any
phenomenon was demanded, to have recour&s;e
to their <HI>faculties</HI> or <HI>occult qualities,</HI> and to
&s;ay, for in&s;tance, that bread nouri&s;hed by its nu|tritive
faculty, and &s;enna purged by its purga|tive:
But it has been di&s;covered, that this &s;ub|terfuge
was nothing but the di&s;gui&s;e of ignorance;
and that the&s;e philo&s;ophers, though le&s;s ingenu|ous,
really &s;aid the &s;ame thing with the &s;ceptics
or the vulgar, who fairly confe&s;&s;ed, that they
knew not the cau&s;e of the&s;e phenomena. In like
<PB N="55" REF="57">
manner, when it is a&s;ked, what cau&s;e produces
order in the ideas of the Supreme Being, can
any other rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned by you, Anthro|pomorphites,
than that it is a <HI>rational</HI> faculty,
and that &s;uch is the nature of the Deity? But
why a &s;imilar an&s;wer will not be equally &s;atisfac|tory
in accounting for the order of the world,
without having recour&s;e to any &s;uch intelligent
creator, as you in&s;i&s;t on, may be difficult to de|termine.
It is only to &s;ay, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> is the na|ture
of material objects, and that they are all o|riginally
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a <HI>faculty</HI> of order and pro|portion.
The&s;e are only more learned and ela|borate
ways of confe&s;&s;ing our ignorance; nor
has the one hypothe&s;is any real advantage above
the other, except in its greater conformity to
vulgar prejudices.</P>
<P>You have di&s;played this argument with great
empha&s;is, replied CLEANTHES: You &s;eem not
&s;en&s;ible, how ea&s;y it is to an&s;wer it. Even
in common life, if I a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for any event;
is it any objection, PHILO, that I cannot a&s;&s;ign
the cau&s;e of that cau&s;e, and an&s;wer every new
que&s;tion, which may ince&s;&s;antly be &s;tarted? And
what philo&s;ophers could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubmit to &s;o ri|gid
a rule? philo&s;ophers, who confe&s;s ultimate
cau&s;es to be totally unknown, and are &s;en&s;ible,
that the mo&s;t refined principles, into which they
trace the phenomena, are &s;till to them as inex|plicable
as the&s;e phenomena them&s;elves are to the
vulgar. The order and arrangement of nature,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
the curious adju&s;tment of final cau&s;es, the plain
u&s;e and intention of every part and organ; all
the&s;e be&s;peak in the cleare&s;t language an intel|ligent
cau&s;e or author. The heavens and the
earth join in the &s;ame te&s;timony: The whole
chorus of Nature rai&s;es one hymn to the prai&s;es
of its creator: You alone, or almo&s;t alone, di&s;|turb
this general harmony. You &s;tart ab&s;tru&s;e
doubts, cavils, and objections: You a&s;k me,
what is the cau&s;e of this cau&s;e? I know not;
I care not; that concerns not me. I have found
a Deity; and here I &s;top my enquiry. Let tho&s;e
go farther, who are wi&s;er or more enterpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>I pretend to be neither, replied PHILO: and
for that very rea&s;on, I &s;hould never perhaps have
attempted to go &s;o far; e&s;pecially when I am &s;en|&s;ible,
that I mu&s;t at la&s;t be contented to &s;it down
with the &s;ame an&s;wer, which, without farther
trouble, might have &s;atisfied me from the begin|ning.
If I am &s;till to remain in utter ignorance
of cau&s;es, and can ab&s;olutely give an explication
of nothing, I &s;hall never e&s;teem it any advantage
to &s;hove off for a moment a difficulty, which, you
acknowledge, mu&s;t immediately, in its full force,
recur upon me. Naturali&s;ts indeed very ju&s;tly
explain particular effects by more general cau&s;es;
though the&s;e general cau&s;es them&s;elves &s;hould re|main
in the end totally inexplicable: but they
never &s;urely thought it &s;atisfactory to explain a
particular effect by a particular cau&s;e, which was
no more to be accounted for than the effect it&s;elf.
<PB N="57" REF="59">
An ideal &s;y&s;tem, arranged of it&s;elf, without a
precedent de&s;ign, is not a whit more explicable
than a material one, which attains its order in a

the latter &s;uppo&s;ition than in the former.</P>

e&s;teemed this rea&s;oning &s;o natural as
to put it into the mouth of his EPICUREAN.

If this argument, I &s;ay, had any force
in former ages; how much greater mu&s;t it have
at pre&s;ent; when the bounds of Nature are &s;o in|finitely
enlarged, and &s;uch a magnificent &s;cene is
opened to us? It is &s;till more unrea&s;onable to
form our idea of &s;o unlimited a cau&s;e from our
experience of the narrow productions of human
de&s;ign and invention.</P>
<P>The di&s;coveries by micro&s;copes, as they open a
new univer&s;e in miniature, are &s;till objections,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
according to you; arguments, according to me.
The farther we pu&s;h our re&s;earches of this kind,
we are &s;till led to infer the univer&s;al cau&s;e of all to
be va&s;tly different from mankind, or from any
object of human experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>And what &s;ay you to the di&s;coveries in anatomy,
chymi&s;try, botany? &mdash; The&s;e &s;urely are no ob|jections,
replied CLEANTHES: they only di&s;co|ver
new in&s;tances of art and contrivance. It is
&s;till the image of mind reflected on us from innu|merable
objects. Add, a mind <HI>like the hu|man,</HI>
&s;aid PHILO. I know of no other, re|plied
CLEANTHES. And the liker the bet|ter,
in&s;i&s;ted PHILO. To be &s;ure, &s;aid CLE|ANTHES.</P>
<P>Now, CLEANTHES, &s;aid PHILO, with an air
of alacrity and triumph, mark the con&s;equences.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By this method of rea&s;oning, you renounce
all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of the
Deity. For as the cau&s;e ought only to be propor|tioned
to the effect, and the effect, &s;o far as it
falls under our cogni&s;ance, is not infinite; what
preten&s;ions have we, upon your &s;uppo&s;itions, to
a&s;cribe that attribute to the divine Being? You
will &s;till in&s;i&s;t, that, by removing him &s;o much
from all &s;imilarity to human creatures, we give
into the mo&s;t arbitrary hypothe&s;is, and at the
&s;ame time, weaken all proofs of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> You have no rea&s;on, on your theory,
for a&s;cribing perfection to the Deity, even in his
finite capacity; or for &s;uppo&s;ing him free from
<PB N="60" REF="62">
every error, mi&s;take, or incoherence in his un|dertakings.
There are many inexplicable diffi|culties
in the works of Nature, which, if we al|low
a perfect author to be proved <HI>a priori,</HI> are
ea&s;ily &s;olved, and become only &s;eeming difficul|ties,
from the narrow capacity of man, who can|not
trace infinite relations. But according to your
method of rea&s;oning, the&s;e difficulties become all
real; and perhaps will be in&s;i&s;ted on, as new in|&s;tances
of likene&s;s to human art and contrivance.
At lea&s;t, you mu&s;t acknowledge, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible
for us to tell, from our limited views, whe|ther
this &s;y&s;tem contains any great faults, or de|&s;erves
any con&s;iderable prai&s;e, if compared to
other po&s;&s;ible, and even real &s;y&s;tems. Could a
pea&s;ant, if the AENEID were read to him, pro|nounce
that poem to be ab&s;olutely faultle&s;s, or
even a&s;&s;ign to it its proper rank among the pro|ductions
of human wit; he, who had never &s;een
any other production?</P>
<P>But were this world ever &s;o perfect a produc|tion,
it mu&s;t &s;till remain uncertain, whether all
the excellencies of the work can ju&s;tly be a&s;cri|bed
to the workman. If we &s;urvey a &s;hip, what
an exalted idea mu&s;t we form of the ingenuity of
the carpenter, who framed &s;o complicated u&s;eful
and beautiful a machine? And what &s;urpri&s;e
mu&s;t we feel, when we find him a &s;tupid mechanic,
who imitated others, and copied an art, which,
through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, after multiplied
trials, mi&s;takes, corrections, deliberations, and
<PB N="61" REF="63">
controver&s;ies, had been gradually improving?
Many worlds might have been botched and bun|gled,
throughout an eternity, ere this &s;y&s;tem
was &s;truck out: much labour lo&s;t: many fruit|le&s;s
trials made: and a &s;low, but continued im|provement
carried on during infinite ages in the
art of world-making. In &s;uch &s;ubjects, who can
determine, where the truth; nay, who can con|jecture
where the probability, lies; amid&s;t a great
number of hypothe&s;es which may be propo&s;ed,
and a &s;till greater number, which may be ima|gined?</P>
<P>And what &s;hadow of an argument, continued
PHILO, can you produce, from your hypothe&s;is,
to prove the unity of the Deity? A great num|ber
of men join in building a hou&s;e or &s;hip, in
rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth: why
may not &s;everal deities combine in contriving and
framing a world? This is only &s;o much greater
&s;imilarity to human affairs. By &s;haring the work
among &s;everal, we may &s;o much farther limit the
attributes of each, and get rid of that exten&s;ive
power and knowledge, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed in
one deity, and which, according to you, can on|ly
&s;erve to weaken the proof of his exi&s;tence.
And if &s;uch fooli&s;h, &s;uch vicious creatures as man
can yet often unite in framing and executing one
plan; how much more tho&s;e deities or daemons,
whom we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal degrees more per|fect?</P>
<P>To multiply cau&s;es, without nece&s;&s;ity, is in|deed
<PB N="62" REF="64">
contrary to true philo&s;ophy: but this prin|ciple
applies not to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Were one
deity antecedently proved by your theory, who
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every attribute, requi&s;ite to the
production of the univer&s;e; it would be needle&s;s,
I own (though not ab&s;urd) to &s;uppo&s;e any other
deity exi&s;tent. But while it is &s;till a que&s;tion,
Whether all the&s;e attributes are united in one
&s;ubject, or di&s;per&s;ed among &s;everal independent
beings: by what phenomena in nature can we
pretend to decide the controver&s;y? Where we
&s;ee a body rai&s;ed in a &s;cale, we are &s;ure that there
is in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, however concealed from
&s;ight, &s;ome counterpoi&s;ing weight equal to it:
but it is &s;till allowed to doubt, whether that
weight be an aggregate of &s;everal di&s;tinct bodies,
or one uniform united ma&s;s. And if the weight
requi&s;ite very much exceeds any thing which we
have ever &s;een conjoined in any &s;ingle body, the
former &s;uppo&s;ition becomes &s;till more probable
and natural. An intelligent being of &s;uch va&s;t
power and capacity, as is nece&s;&s;ary to produce the
univer&s;e, or, to &s;peak in the language of ancient
philo&s;ophy, &s;o prodigious an animal, exceeds all
analogy and even comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>But farther, CLEANTHES; men are mortal,
and renew their &s;pecies by generation; and this
is common to all living creatures. The two great
&s;exes of male and female, &s;ays MILTON, ani|mate
the world. Why mu&s;t this circum&s;tance,
&s;o univer&s;al, &s;o e&s;&s;ential, be excluded from tho&s;e
<PB N="63" REF="65">
numerous and limited deities? Behold then the
theogony of ancient times brought back upon us.</P>
<P>And why not become a perfect Anthropomor|phite?
Why not a&s;&s;ert the deity or deities to be
corporeal, and to have eyes, a no&s;e, mouth, ears,
&amp;c.? EPICURUS maintained, that no man had
ever &s;een rea&s;on but in a human figure; therefore
the gods mu&s;t have a human figure. And this
argument, which is de&s;ervedly &s;o much ridiculed
by CICERO, becomes, according to you, &s;olid
and philo&s;ophical.</P>
<P>In a word, CLEANTHES, a man, who follows
your hypothe&s;is, is able, perhaps, to a&s;&s;ert, or
conjecture, that the univer&s;e, &s;ometime, aro&s;e
from &s;omething like de&s;ign: but beyond that po|&s;ition
he cannot a&s;certain one &s;ingle circum&s;tance,
and is left afterwards to fix every point of his the|ology,
by the utmo&s;t licence of fancy and hypo|the&s;is.
This world, for aught he knows, is very
faulty and imperfect, compared to a &s;uperior
&s;tandard; and was only the fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ay of
&s;ome infant deity, who afterwards abandoned it,
a&s;hamed of his lame performance: it is the work
only of &s;ome dependent, inferior deity; and is
the object of deri&s;ion to his &s;uperiors: it is the
production of old age and dotage in &s;ome &s;uper|annuated
deity; and ever &s;ince his death, has
run on at adventures, from the fir&s;t impul&s;e and
active force, which it received from him. You
ju&s;tly give &s;igns of horror, DEMEA, at the&s;e
&s;trange &s;uppo&s;itions: but the&s;e, and a thou&s;and
<PB N="64" REF="66">
more of the &s;ame kind, are CLEANTHES's &s;up|po&s;itions,
not mine. From the moment the attri|butes
of the Deity are &s;uppo&s;ed finite, all the&s;e
have place. And I cannot, for my part, think,
that &s;o wild and un&s;ettled a &s;y&s;tem of theology is,
in any re&s;pect, preferable to none at all.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions I ab&s;olutely di&s;own, cried
CLEANTHES: they &s;trike me, however, with no
horror; e&s;pecially, when propo&s;ed in that ram|bling
way, in which they drop from you. On
the contrary, they give me plea&s;ure, when I &s;ee,
that, by the utmo&s;t indulgence of your imagina|tion,
you never get rid of the hypothe&s;is of de|&s;ign
in the univer&s;e; but are obliged, at every
turn, to have recour&s;e to it. To this conce&s;&s;ion I
adhere &s;teadily; and this I regard as a &s;ufficient
foundation for religion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be a &s;light fabric, indeed, &s;aid DE|MEA,
which can be erected on &s;o tottering a
foundation. While we are uncertain, whether
there is one deity or many; whether the deity
or deities, to whom we owe our exi&s;tence, be
perfect or imperfect, &s;ubordinate or &s;upreme,
dead or alive; what tru&s;t or confidence can we
repo&s;e in them? What devotion or wor&s;hip ad|dre&s;s
to them? What veneration or obedience
pay them? To all the purpo&s;es of life, the theory
<PB N="65" REF="67">
of religion becomes altogether u&s;ele&s;s:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part VI.</NOTE> and even
with regard to &s;peculative con&s;equences, its un|certainty,
according to you, mu&s;t render it total|ly
precarious and un&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>To render it &s;till more un&s;atisfactory, &s;aid
PHILO, there occurs to me another hypothe&s;is,
which mu&s;t acquire an air of probability from the
method of rea&s;oning &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by CLE|ANTHES.
That like effects ari&s;e from like
cau&s;es: this principle he &s;uppo&s;es the foundation
of all religion. But there is another principle of
the &s;ame kind, no le&s;s certain, and derived from
the &s;ame &s;ource of experience; That where &s;everal
known circum&s;tances are ob&s;erved to be &s;imilar,
the unknown will al&s;o be found &s;imilar. Thus,
if we &s;ee the limbs of a human body, we con|clude,
that it is al&s;o attended with a human head,
though hid from us. Thus, if we &s;ee, through a
chink in a wall, a &s;mall part of the &s;un, we con|clude,
that, were the wall removed, we &s;hould &s;ee
the whole body. In &s;hort, this method of rea&s;on|ing
is &s;o obvious and familiar, that no &s;cruple can
ever be made with regard to its &s;olidity.</P>
<P>Now if we &s;urvey the univer&s;e, &s;o far as it falls
under our knowledge, it bears a great re&s;em|blance
to an animal or organized body, and &s;eems
actuated with a like principle of life and motion.
A continual circulation of matter in it produces
no di&s;order: a continual wa&s;te in every part is
ince&s;&s;antly repaired: the clo&s;e&s;t &s;ympathy is per|ceived
throughout the entire &s;y&s;tem: and each
<PB N="66" REF="68">
part or member, in performing its proper offices,
operates both to its own pre&s;ervation and to that
of the whole. The world, therefore, I infer, is
an animal, and the Deity is the SOUL of the
world, actuating it, and actuated by it.</P>
<P>You have too much learning, CLEANTHES,
to be at all &s;urpri&s;ed at this opinion, which, you
know, was maintained by almo&s;t all the Thei&s;ts
of antiquity, and chiefly prevails in their di&s;cour|&s;es
and rea&s;onings. For though &s;ometimes the
ancient philo&s;ophers rea&s;on from final cau&s;es, as
if they thought the world the workman&s;hip of
God; yet it appears rather their favorite notion
to con&s;ider it as his body, who&s;e organization
renders it &s;ub&s;ervient to him. And it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that as the univer&s;e re&s;embles more a
human body than it does the works of human art
and contrivance; if our limited analogy could
ever, with any propriety, be extended to the
whole of nature, the inference &s;eems ju&s;ter in fa|vour
of the ancient than the modern theory.</P>
<P>There are many other advantages too, in the
former theory, which recommended it to the an|cient
Theologians. Nothing more repugnant to all
their notions, becau&s;e nothing more repugnant to
common experience, than mind without body; a
mere &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, which fell not under
their &s;en&s;es nor comprehen&s;ion, and of which they
had not ob&s;erved one &s;ingle in&s;tance throughout
all nature. Mind and body they knew, becau&s;e
they felt both: an order, arrangement, organi|zation,
or internal machinery in both they like|wi&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="69">
knew, after the &s;ame manner: and it could
not but &s;eem rea&s;onable to transfer this experience
to the univer&s;e, and to &s;uppo&s;e the divine mind
and body to be al&s;o coeval, and to have, both of
them, order and arrangement naturally inherent
in them, and in&s;eparable from them.</P>
<P>Here therefore is a new &s;pecies of <HI>Anthropo|morphi&s;m,</HI>
CLEANTHES, on which you may de|liberate;
and a theory which &s;eems not liable to
any con&s;iderable difficulties. You are too much
&s;uperior &s;urely to <HI>&s;y&s;tematical prejudices,</HI> to find
any more difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing an animal body
to be, originally, of it&s;elf, or from unknown
cau&s;es, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of order and organization, than
in &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;imilar order to belong to mind.
But the <HI>vulgar prejudice,</HI> that body and mind
ought always to accompany each other, ought
not, one &s;hould think, to be entirely neglected;
&s;ince it is founded on <HI>vulgar experience,</HI> the on|ly
guide which you profe&s;s to follow in all the&s;e
theological enquiries. And if you a&s;&s;ert, that
our limited experience is an unequal &s;tandard, by
which to judge of the unlimited extent of nature;
you entirely abandon your own hypothe&s;is, and
mu&s;t thenceforward adopt our My&s;tici&s;m, as you
call it, and admit of the ab&s;olute incomprehen&s;i|bility
of the Divine Nature.</P>
<P>This theory, I own, replied CLEANTHES, has
never before occurred to me, though a pretty na|tural
one; and I cannot readily, upon &s;o &s;hort an
examination and reflection, deliver any opinion
<PB N="68" REF="70">
with regard to it. You are very &s;crupulous,
indeed, &s;aid PHILO; were I to examine any &s;y|&s;tem
of yours, I &s;hould not have acted with half
that caution and re&s;erve, in &s;tarting objections
and difficulties to it. However, if any thing oc|cur
to you, you will oblige us by propo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Why then, replied CLEANTHES, it &s;eems to
me, that, though the world does, in many circum|&s;tances,
re&s;emble an animal body; yet is the ana|logy
al&s;o defective in many circum&s;tances, the
mo&s;t material: no organs of &s;en&s;e; no &s;eat of
thought or rea&s;on; no one preci&s;e origin of mo|tion
and action. In &s;hort, it &s;eems to bear a
&s;tronger re&s;emblance to a vegetable than to an a|nimal,
and your inference would be &s;o far incon|clu&s;ive
in favour of the &s;oul of the world.</P>
<P>But in the next place, your theory &s;eems to im|ply
the eternity of the world; and that is a prin|ciple,
which, I think, can be refuted by the
&s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons and probabilities. I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t
an argument to this purpo&s;e, which, I believe,
has not been in&s;i&s;ted on by any writer. Tho&s;e,
who rea&s;on from the late origin of arts and &s;ci|ences,
though their inference wants not force,
may perhaps be refuted by con&s;iderations, derived
from the nature of human &s;ociety, which is in
continual revolution, between ignorance and
knowledge, liberty and &s;lavery, riches and pover|ty;
&s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us, from our limi|ted
experience, to foretell with a&s;&s;urance what e|vents
may or may not be expected. Ancient
<PB N="69" REF="71">
learning and hi&s;tory &s;eem to have been in great
danger of entirely peri&s;hing after the inundation
of the barbarous nations; and had the&s;e convul|&s;ions
continued a little longer, or been a little more
violent, we &s;hould not probably have now known
what pa&s;&s;ed in the world a few centuries before
us. Nay, were it not for the &s;uper&s;tition of the
Popes, who pre&s;erved a little jargon of LATIN,
in order to &s;upport the appearance of an ancient
and univer&s;al church, that tongue mu&s;t have been
utterly lo&s;t: in which ca&s;e, the We&s;tern world,
being totally barbarous, would not have been in
a fit di&s;po&s;ition for receiving the GREEK language
and learning, which was conveyed to them after
the &s;acking of CONSTANTINOPLE. When learn|ing
and books had been extingui&s;hed, even the
mechanical arts would have fallen con&s;iderably to
decay; and it is ea&s;ily imagined, that fable or
tradition might a&s;cribe to them a much later ori|gin
than the true one. This vulgar argument,
therefore, again&s;t the eternity of the world, &s;eems
a little precarious.</P>
<P>But here appears to be the foundation of a
better argument. LUCULLUS was the fir&s;t that
brought cherry-trees from ASIA to EUROPE;
though that tree thrives &s;o well in many EU|ROPEAN
climates, that it grows in the woods
without any culture. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that, through|out
a whole eternity, no EUROPEAN had ever
pa&s;&s;ed into ASIA, and thought of tran&s;planting
&s;o delicious a fruit into his own country? Or if
<PB N="70" REF="72">
the tree was once tran&s;planted and propagated,
how could it ever afterwards peri&s;h? Empires may
ri&s;e and fall; liberty and &s;lavery &s;ucceed alter|nately;
ignorance and knowledge give place to
each other; but the cherry-tree will &s;till remain
in the woods of GREECE, SPAIN and ITALY,
and will never be affected by the revolutions of
human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is not two thou&s;and years &s;ince vines were
tran&s;planted into FRANCE; though there is no
climate in the world more favourable to them.
It is not three centuries &s;ince hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep,
&s;wine, dogs, corn were known in AMERICA. Is
it po&s;&s;ible, that, during the revolutions of a whole
eternity, there never aro&s;e a COLUMBUS, who
might open the communication between EUROPE
and that continent? We may as well imagine,
that all men would wear &s;tockings for ten thou|&s;and
years, and never have the &s;en&s;e to think of
garters to tie them. All the&s;e &s;eem convincing
proofs of the youth, or rather infancy of the
world; as being founded on the operation of
principles more con&s;tant and &s;teady, than tho&s;e
by which human &s;ociety is governed and direct|ed.
Nothing le&s;s than a total convul&s;ion of the
elements will ever de&s;troy all the EUROPEAN
animals and vegetables, which are now to be
found in the We&s;tern world.</P>
<P>And what argument have you again&s;t &s;uch
convul&s;ions? replied PHILO. Strong and almo&s;t
inconte&s;table proofs may be traced over the whole
<PB N="71" REF="73">
earth, that every part of this globe has continued
for many ages entirely covered with water. And
though order were &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;eparable from
matter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be
&s;u&s;ceptible of many and great revolutions, through
the endle&s;s periods of eternal duration. The in|ce&s;&s;ant
changes, to which every part of it is &s;ub|ject,
&s;eem to intimate &s;ome &s;uch general tran&s;|&s;ormations;
though at the &s;ame time, it is ob|&s;ervable,
that all the changes and corruptions,
of which we have ever had experience, are but
pa&s;&s;ages from one &s;tate of order to another; nor
can matter ever re&s;t in total deformity and confu|&s;ion.
What we &s;ee in the parts, we may infer
in the whole; at lea&s;t, that is the method of
rea&s;oning, on which you re&s;t your whole theory.
And were I obliged to defend any particular &s;y|&s;tem
of this nature (which I never willingly &s;hould
do) I e&s;teem none more plau&s;ible, than that
which a&s;cribes an eternal, inherent principle of
order to the world; though attended with great
and continual revolutions and alterations. This
at once &s;olves all difficulties; and if the &s;olution,
by being &s;o general, is not entirely complete and
&s;atisfactory, it is, at lea&s;t, a theory, that we mu&s;t,
&s;ooner or later, have recour&s;e to, whatever &s;y|&s;tem
we embrace. How could things have been
as they are, were there not an original, inherent
principle of order &s;omewhere, in thought or in
matter? And it is very indifferent to which of
the&s;e we give the preference. Chance has no
<PB N="72" REF="74">
place, on any hypothe&s;is, &s;ceptical or religious.
Every thing is &s;urely governed by &s;teady, invio|lable
laws. And were the inmo&s;t e&s;&s;ence of
things laid open to us, we &s;hould then di&s;cover
a &s;cene, of which, at pre&s;ent, we can have no
idea. In&s;tead of admiring the order of natural
beings, we &s;hould clearly &s;ee, that it was ab&s;o|lutely
impo&s;&s;ible for them, in the &s;malle&s;t article,
ever to admit of any other di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Were any one inclined to revive the ancient Pa|gan
Theology, which maintained, as we learn from
He&s;iod, that this globe was governed by 30,000
deities, who aro&s;e from the unknown powers of
nature: you would naturally object, CLEAN|THES,
that nothing is gained by this hypothe&s;is;
and that it is as ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e all men and ani|mals,
beings more numerous, but le&s;s perfect,
to have &s;prung immediately from a like origin.
Pu&s;h the &s;ame inference a &s;tep farther; and you
will find a numerous &s;ociety of deities as expli|cable
as one univer&s;al deity, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, with|in
him&s;elf, the powers and perfections of the
whole &s;ociety. All the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, then, of Scep|tici&s;m,
Polythei&s;m, and Thei&s;m, you mu&s;t allow,
on your principles, to be on a like footing, and
that no one of them has any advantages over the
others. You may thence learn the fallacy of
your principles.</P>

<HEAD>PART VII.</HEAD>
<P>BUT here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part VII.</NOTE> continued PHILO, in examining
the ancient &s;y&s;tem of the &s;oul of the world, there
&s;trikes me, all on a &s;udden, a new idea, which,
if ju&s;t, mu&s;t go near to &s;ubvert all your rea&s;on|ing,
and de&s;troy even your fir&s;t inferences, on
which you repo&s;e &s;uch confidence. If the uni|ver&s;e
bears a greater likene&s;s to animal bodies
and to vegetables, than to the works of human
art, it is more probable, that its cau&s;e re&s;embles
the cau&s;e of the former than that of the latter,
and its origin ought rather to be a&s;cribed to ge|neration
or vegetation than to rea&s;on or de&s;ign.
Your conclu&s;ion, even according to your own
principles, is therefore lame and defective.</P>
<P>Pray open up this argument a little farther,
&s;aid DEMEA. For I do not rightly apprehend it,
in that conci&s;e manner, in which you have ex|pre&s;&s;ed
it.</P>
<P>Our friend CLEANTHES, replied PHILO,
as you have heard, a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ince no que&s;tion
of fact can be proved otherwi&s;e than by experi|ence,
the exi&s;tence of a Deity admits not of proof
from any other medium. The world, &s;ays he,
re&s;embles the works of human contrivance:
Therefore its cau&s;e mu&s;t al&s;o re&s;emble that of the
other. Here we may remark, that the opera|tion
of one very &s;mall part of nature, to wit
<PB N="74" REF="76">
man, upon another very &s;mall part, to wit that
inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the
rule, by which CLEANTHES judges of the ori|gin
of the whole; and he mea&s;ures objects, &s;o
widely di&s;proportioned, by the &s;ame individual
&s;tandard. But to wave all objections drawn from
this topic; I affirm, that there are other parts
of the univer&s;e (be&s;ides the machines of human
invention) which bear &s;till a greater re&s;emblance
to the fabric of the world, and which therefore
afford a better conjecture concerning the univer|&s;al
origin of this &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e parts are animals
and vegetables. The world plainly re&s;embles
more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a
watch or a knitting-loom. Its cau&s;e, therefore,
it is more probable, re&s;embles the cau&s;e of the
former. The cau&s;e of the former is generation
or vegetation. The cau&s;e, therefore, of the
world, we may infer to be &s;omething &s;imilar or
analagous to generation or vegetation.</P>
<P>But how is it conceivable, &s;aid DEMEA, that
the world can ari&s;e from any thing &s;imilar to ve|getation
or generation?</P>
<P>Very ea&s;ily, replied PHILO. In like manner
as a tree &s;heds its &s;eed into the neighbouring
fields, and produces other trees; &s;o the great ve|getable,
the world, or this planetary &s;y&s;tem, pro|duces
within it&s;elf certain &s;eeds, which, being
&s;cattered into the &s;urrounding chaos, vegetate
into new worlds. A comet, for in&s;tance, is the
&s;eed of a world; and after it has been fully
<PB N="75" REF="77">
ripened, by pa&s;&s;ing from &s;un to &s;un, and &s;tar to
&s;tar, it is at la&s;t to&s;t into the unformed elements,
which every where &s;urround this univer&s;e, and
immedialy &s;prouts up into a new &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Or if, for the &s;ake of variety (for I &s;ee no o|ther
advantage) we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this world to
be an animal; a comet is the egg of this animal;
and in like manner as an o&s;trich lays its egg in
the &s;and, which, without any farther care, hatch|es
the egg, and produces a new animal; &s;o.......I
under&s;tand you, &s;ays DEMEA: But what wild,
arbitrary &s;uppo&s;itions are the&s;e? What <HI>data</HI>
have you for &s;uch extraordinary conclu&s;ions? And
is the &s;light, imaginary re&s;emblance of the world
to a vegetable or an animal &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h
the &s;ame inference with regard to both? Ob|jects,
which are in general &s;o widely different;
ought they to be a &s;tandard for each other?</P>
<P>Right, cries PHILO: This is the topic on which
I have all along in&s;i&s;ted. I have &s;till a&s;&s;erted, that
we have no <HI>data</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h any &s;y&s;tem of co&s;|mogony.
Our experience, &s;o imperfect in it|&s;elf,
and &s;o limited both in extent and duration,
can afford us no probable conjecture concerning
the whole of things. But if we mu&s;t needs fix
on &s;ome hypothe&s;is; by what rule, pray, ought
we to determine our choice? Is there any other
rule than the greater &s;imilarity of the objects com|pared?
And does not a plant or an animal, which
&s;prings from vegetation or generation, bear a
&s;tronger re&s;emblance to the world, than does
<PB N="76" REF="78">
any artificial machine, which ari&s;es from rea&s;on
and de&s;ign?</P>
<P>But what is this vegetation and generation of
which you talk, &s;aid DEMEA? Can you explain
their operations, and anatomize that fine internal
&s;tructure, on which they depend?</P>
<P>As much, at lea&s;t, replied PHILO, as CLE|ANTHES
can explain the operations of rea&s;on,
or anatomize that internal &s;tructure, on which <HI>it</HI>
depends. But without any &s;uch elaborate di&s;|qui&s;itions,
when I &s;ee an animal, I infer, that it
&s;prang from generation; and that with as great
certainty as you conclude a hou&s;e to have been
reared by de&s;ign. The&s;e words, <HI>generation,
rea&s;on,</HI> mark only certain powers and energies
in nature, who&s;e effects are known, but who&s;e
e&s;&s;ence is incomprehen&s;ible; and one of the&s;e
principles, more than the other, has no privilege
for being made a &s;tandard to the whole of na|ture.</P>
<P>In reality, DEMEA, it may rea&s;onably be ex|pected,
that the larger the views are which we
take of things, the better will they conduct us
in our conclu&s;ions concerning &s;uch extraordinary
and &s;uch magnificent &s;ubjects. In this little cor|ner
of the world alone, there are four prin|ciples,
<HI>Rea&s;on, In&s;tinct, Generation, Vegeta|tion,</HI>
which are &s;imilar to each other, and are
the cau&s;es of &s;imilar effects. What a num|ber
of other principles may we naturally &s;uppo&s;e
in the immen&s;e extent and variety of the univer&s;e,
could we travel from planet to planet and from
<PB N="77" REF="79">
&s;y&s;tem to &s;y&s;tem, in order to examine each part
of this mighty fabric? Any one of the&s;e four
principles above mentioned (and a hundred o|thers,
which lie open to our conjecture) may
afford us a theory, by which to judge of the o|rigin
of the world; and it is a palpable and e|gregious
partiality, to confine our view entirely
to that principle, by which our own minds ope|rate.
Were this principle more intelligible on
that account, &s;uch a partiality might be &s;ome|what
excu&s;eable: But rea&s;on, in its internal fa|bric
and &s;tructure, is really as little known to us
as in&s;tinct or vegetation; and perhaps even that
vague, undeterminate word, <HI>Nature,</HI> to which
the vulgar refer every thing, is not at the bot|tom
more inexplicable. The effects of the&s;e
principles are all known to us from experience:
But the principles them&s;elves, and their manner
of operation are totally unknown: Not is it le&s;s
intelligible, or le&s;s conformable to experience to
&s;ay, that the world aro&s;e by vegetation from a
&s;eed &s;hed by another world, than to &s;ay that it
aro&s;e from a divine rea&s;on or contrivance, ac|cording
to the &s;en&s;e in which CLEANTHES un|der&s;tands
it.</P>
<P>But methinks, &s;aid DEMEA, if the world had
a vegetative quality, and could &s;ow the &s;eeds of
new worlds into the infinite chaos, this power
would be &s;till an additional argument for de&s;ign
in its author. For whence could ari&s;e &s;o won|derful
a faculty but from de&s;ign? Or how can
<PB N="78" REF="80">
order &s;pring from any thing, which perceives not
that order which it be&s;tows?</P>
<P>You need only look around you, replied
PHILO, to &s;atisfy your&s;elf with regard to this
que&s;tion. A tree be&s;tows order and organization
on that tree, which &s;prings from it, without
knowing the order: an animal, in the &s;ame
manner, on its offspring: a bird, on its ne&s;t:
and in&s;tances of this kind are even more frequent
in the world, than tho&s;e of order, which ari&s;e
from rea&s;on and contrivance. To &s;ay that all
this order in animals and vegetables proceeds ul|timately
from de&s;ign, is begging the que&s;tion;
nor can that great point be a&s;certained otherwi&s;e
than by proving <HI>a priori,</HI> both that order is,
from its nature, in&s;eparably attached to thought,
and that it can never, of it&s;elf, or from original
unknown principles, belong to matter.</P>
<P>But farther, DEMEA; this objection, which
you urge, can never be made u&s;e of by CLE|ANTHES,
without renouncing a defence, which
he has already made again&s;t one of my objec|tions.
When I enquired concerning the cau&s;e
of that &s;upreme rea&s;on and intelligence, into
which he re&s;olves every thing; he told me, that
the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;atisfying &s;uch enquiries could
never be admitted as an objection in any &s;pecies
of philo&s;ophy. <HI>We mu&s;t &s;top &s;omewhere,</HI> &s;ays
he; <HI>nor is it ever within the reach of human
capacity to explain ultimate cau&s;es, or &s;how
the la&s;t connections of any objects. It is &s;uffi|cient,
<PB N="79" REF="81">
if the &s;teps, &s;o far as we go, are &s;up|ported
by experience and ob&s;ervation.</HI> Now,
that vegetation and generation, as well as rea&s;on,
are experienced to be principles of order in na|ture,
is undeniable. If I re&s;t my &s;y&s;tem of co&s;|mogony
on the former, preferably to the latter,
'tis at my choice. The matter &s;eems entirely
arbitrary. And when CLEANTHES a&s;ks me
what is the cau&s;e of my great vegetative or gene|rative
faculty, I am equally intitled to a&s;k him
the cau&s;e of his great rea&s;oning principle. The&s;e
que&s;tions we have agreed to forbear on both
&s;ides; and it is chiefly his intere&s;t on the pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion to &s;tick to this agreement. Judging by
our limited and imperfect experience, generation
has &s;ome privileges above rea&s;on: For we &s;ee e|very
day the latter ari&s;e from the former, never
the former from the latter.</P>
<P>Compare, I be&s;eech you, the con&s;equences on
both &s;ides. The world, &s;ay I, re&s;embles an ani|mal,
therefore it is an animal, therefore it aro&s;e
from generation. The &s;teps, I confe&s;s, are wide;
yet there is &s;ome &s;mall appearance of analogy in
each &s;tep. The world, &s;ays CLEANTHES, re|&s;embles
a machine, therefore it is a machine,
therefore it aro&s;e from de&s;ign. The &s;teps here are
equally wide, and the analogy le&s;s &s;triking. And
if he pretends to carry on <HI>my</HI> hypothe&s;is a &s;tep
farther, and to infer de&s;ign or rea&s;on from the
great principle of generation, on which I in&s;i&s;t;
I may, with better authority, u&s;e the &s;ame free|dom
<PB N="80" REF="82">
to pu&s;h farther his hypothe&s;is, and infer a
divine generation or theogony from his principle
of rea&s;on. I have at lea&s;t &s;ome faint &s;hadow of
experience, which is the utmo&s;t, that can ever be
attained in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Rea&s;on, in innu|merable
in&s;tances, is ob&s;erved to ari&s;e from the
principle of generation, and never to ari&s;e from
any other principle.</P>
<P>HESIOD, and all the ancient Mythologi&s;ts,
were &s;o &s;truck with this analogy, that they uni|ver&s;ally
explained the origin of nature from an a|nimal
birth, and copulation. PLATO too, &s;o far
as he is intelligible, &s;eems to have adopted &s;ome
&s;uch notion in his TIMAEUS.</P>
<P>The BRAMINS a&s;&s;ert, that the world aro&s;e
from an in&s;inite &s;pider, who &s;pun this whole com|plicated
ma&s;s from his bowels, and annihilates af|terwards
the whole or any part of it, by ab&s;orb|ing
it again, and re&s;olving it into his own e&s;&s;ence.
Here is a &s;pecies of co&s;mogony, which appears to
us ridiculous; becau&s;e a &s;pider is a little contemp|tible
animal, who&s;e operations we are never like|ly
to take for a model of the whole univer&s;e.
But &s;till here is a new &s;pecies of analogy, even in
our globe. And were there a planet, wholly in|habited
by &s;piders, (which is very po&s;&s;ible) this
inference would there appear as natural and irre|fragable
as that which in our planet a&s;cribes the
origin of all things to de&s;ign and intelligence, as
explained by CLEANTHES. Why an orderly &s;y|&s;tem
may not be &s;pun from the belly as well as
<PB N="81" REF="83">
from the brain, it will be difficult for him to give
a &s;atisfactory rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES,
that, of all men living, the ta&s;k which you have
undertaken, of rai&s;ing doubts and objections,
&s;uits you be&s;t, and &s;eems, in a manner, natural
and unavoidable to you. So great is your fertili|ty
of invention, that I am not a&s;hamed to acknow|ledge
my&s;elf unable, on a &s;udden, to &s;olve regu|larly
&s;uch out-of-the-way difficulties as you ince&s;|&s;antly
&s;tart upon me: though I clearly &s;ee, in ge|neral,
their fallacy and error. And I que&s;tion
not, but you are your&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, in the &s;ame
ca&s;e, and have not the &s;olution &s;o ready as the
objection; while you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that com|mon
&s;en&s;e and rea&s;on is entirely again&s;t you, and
that &s;uch whim&s;ies as you have delivered, may
puzzle, but never can convince us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT you a&s;cribe to the fertility of my inven|tion,
replied PHILO, is entirely owing to the na|ture
of the &s;ubject. In &s;ubjects, adapted to the
narrow compa&s;s of human rea&s;on, there is com|monly
but one determination, which carries pro|bability
or conviction with it; and to a man of
&s;ound judgement, all other &s;uppo&s;itions, but that
one, appear entirely ab&s;urd and chimerical. But
in &s;uch que&s;tions, as the pre&s;ent, a hundred con|tradictory
<PB N="82" REF="84">
views may pre&s;erve a kind of imper|fect
analogy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part VIII.</NOTE> and invention has here full &s;cope to
exert it&s;elf. Without any great effort of thought,
I believe that I could, in an in&s;tant, propo&s;e o|ther
&s;y&s;tems of co&s;mogony, which would have
&s;ome faint appearance of truth; though it is a
thou&s;and, a million to one, if either yours or any
one of mine be the true &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; what if I &s;hould revive the old
EPICUREAN hypothe&s;is? This is commonly,
and I believe, ju&s;tly, e&s;teemed the mo&s;t ab&s;urd
&s;y&s;tem, that has yet been propo&s;ed; yet, I know
not, whether, with a few alterations, it might
not be brought to bear a faint appearance of pro|bability.
In&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing matter infinite, as
EPICURUS did; let us &s;uppo&s;e it finite. A finite
number of particles is only &s;u&s;ceptible of finite
tran&s;po&s;itions: and it mu&s;t happen, in an eternal
duration, that every po&s;&s;ible order or po&s;ition
mu&s;t be tried an infinite number of times. This
world, therefore, with all its events, even the
mo&s;t minute, has before been produced and de|&s;troyed,
and will again be produced and de|&s;troyed,
without any bounds and limitations. No
one, who has a conception of the powers of in|finite,
in compari&s;on of finite, will ever &s;cruple
this determination.</P>
<P>But this &s;uppo&s;es, &s;aid DEMEA, that matter
can acquire motion, without any voluntary agent
or fir&s;t mover.</P>
<P>And where is the difficulty, replied PHILO, of
that &s;uppo&s;ition? Every event, before experience,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
is equally difficult and incomprehen&s;ible; and e|very
event, after experience, is equally ea&s;y and
intelligible. Motion, in many in&s;tances, from gra|vity,
from ela&s;ticity, from electricity, begins in mat|ter,
without any known voluntary agent; and to
&s;uppo&s;e always, in the&s;e ca&s;es, an unknown vo|luntary
agent, is mere hypothe&s;is; and hypothe|&s;is
attended with no advantages. The beginning
of motion in matter it&s;elf is as conceivable <HI>a pri|ori</HI>
as its communication from mind and intelli|gence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; why may not motion have been pro|pagated
by impul&s;e through all eternity, and the
&s;ame &s;tock of it, or nearly the &s;ame, be &s;till up|held
in the univer&s;e? As much as is lo&s;t by the
compo&s;ition of motion, as much is gained by its
re&s;olution. And whatever the cau&s;es are, the fact
is certain, that matter is, and always has been in
continual agitation, as far as human experience
or tradition reaches. There is not probably, at
pre&s;ent, in the whole univer&s;e, one particle of
matter at ab&s;olute re&s;t.</P>
<P>And this very con&s;ideration too, continued
PHILO, which we have &s;tumbled on in the cour&s;e
of the argument, &s;ugge&s;ts a new hypothe&s;is of
co&s;mogony, that is not ab&s;olutely ab&s;urd and im|probable.
Is there a &s;y&s;tem, an order, an oeco|nomy
of things, by which matter can pre&s;erve
that perpetual agitation, which &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to
it, and yet maintain a con&s;tancy in the forms,
which it produces? There certainly is &s;uch an
<PB N="84" REF="86">
oeconomy: for this is actually the ca&s;e with the
pre&s;ent world. The continual motion of matter,
therefore, in le&s;s than infinite tran&s;po&s;itions, mu&s;t
produce this oeconomy or order; and by its very
nature, that order, when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;up|ports
it&s;elf, for many ages, if not to eternity.
But where-ever matter is &s;o poized, arranged, and
adju&s;ted as to continue in perpetual motion, and
yet pre&s;erve a con&s;tancy in the forms, its &s;ituation
mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, have all the &s;ame appearance
of art and contrivance, which we ob&s;erve at pre|&s;ent.
All the parts of each form mu&s;t have a re|lation
to each other, and to the whole: and the
whole it&s;elf mu&s;t have a relation to the other parts
of the univer&s;e; to the element, in which the
form &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; to the materials, with which it re|pairs
its wa&s;te and decay; and to every other
form, which is ho&s;tile or friendly. A defect in
any of the&s;e particulars de&s;troys the form; and
the matter, of which it is compo&s;ed, is again &s;et
loo&s;e, and is thrown into irregular motions and
fermentations, till it unite it&s;elf to &s;ome other re|gular
form. If no &s;uch form be prepared to re|ceive
it, and if there be a great quantity of this
corrupted matter in the univer&s;e, the univer&s;e it|&s;elf
is entirely di&s;ordered; whether it be the fee|ble
embryo of a world in its fir&s;t beginnings, that
is thus de&s;troyed, or the rotten carca&s;s of one,
langui&s;hing in old age and infirmity. In either
ca&s;e, a chaos en&s;ues; till finite, though innume|rable
revolutions produce at la&s;t &s;ome forms,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
who&s;e parts and organs are &s;o adju&s;ted as to &s;up|port
the forms amid&s;t a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
matter.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, (for we &s;hall endeavour to vary the
expre&s;&s;ion) that matter were thrown into any po|&s;ition,
by a blind, unguided force; it is evident
that this fir&s;t po&s;ition mu&s;t in all probability be
the mo&s;t confu&s;ed and mo&s;t di&s;orderly imaginable,
without any re&s;emblance to tho&s;e works of human
contrivance, which, along with a &s;ymmetry of
parts, di&s;cover an adju&s;tment of means to ends
and a tendency to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. If the actua|ting
force cea&s;e after this operation, matter mu&s;t
remain for ever in di&s;order, and continue an im|men&s;e
chaos, without any proportion or activity.
But &s;uppo&s;e, that the actuating force, whatever it
be, &s;till continues in matter, this fir&s;t po&s;ition
will immediately give place to a &s;econd, which
will likewi&s;e in all probability be as di&s;orderly as
the fir&s;t, and &s;o on, through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of
changes and revolutions. No particular order or
po&s;ition ever continues a moment unaltered. The
original force, &s;till remaining in activity, gives a
perpetual re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s to matter. Every po&s;&s;ible &s;i|tuation
is produced, and in&s;tantly de&s;troyed. If
a glimp&s;e or dawn of order appears for a moment,
it is in&s;tantly hurried away and confounded, by
that never-cea&s;ing force, which actuates every
part of matter.</P>
<P>Thus the univer&s;e goes on for many ages in a
continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of chaos and di&s;order. But
<PB N="86" REF="88">
is it not po&s;&s;ible that it may &s;ettle at la&s;t, &s;o as not
to lo&s;e its motion and active force (for that we
have &s;uppo&s;ed inherent in it) yet &s;o as to pre&s;erve
an uniformity of appearance, amid&s;t the conti|nual
motion and fluctuation of its parts? This
we find to be the ca&s;e with the univer&s;e at pre&s;ent.
Every individual is perpetually changing, and e|very
part of every individual, and yet the whole
remains, in appearance, the &s;ame. May we not
hope for &s;uch a po&s;ition, or rather be a&s;&s;ured of
it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided mat|ter,
and may not this account for all the appear|ing
wi&s;dom and contrivance, which is in the uni|ver&s;e?
Let us contemplate the &s;ubject a little,
and we &s;hall find, that this adju&s;tment, if attained
by matter, of a &s;eeming &s;tability in the forms,
with a real and perpetual revolution or motion of
parts, affords a plau&s;ible, if not a true &s;olution of
the difficulty.</P>
<P>It is in vain, therefore, to in&s;i&s;t upon the u&s;es
of the parts in animals or vegetables and their
curious adju&s;tment to each other. I would fain
know how an animal could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s its parts
were &s;o adju&s;ted? Do we not find, that it imme|diately

and that its matter corrupting tries &s;ome new

immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter:
and if it were not &s;o, could the world &s;ub&s;i&s;t?

a great, but finite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it fall at la&s;t into the
pre&s;ent or &s;ome &s;uch order?</P>
<P>It is well, replied CLEANTHES, you told us,
that this hypothe&s;is was &s;ugge&s;ted on a &s;udden, in
the cour&s;e of the argument. Had you had lei&s;ure
to examine it, you would &s;oon have perceived the
in&s;uperable objections, to which it is expo&s;ed.
No form, you &s;ay, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s it po&s;&s;e&s;s
tho&s;e powers and organs, requi&s;ite for its &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence:
&s;ome new order or oeconomy mu&s;t be
tried, and &s;o on, without intermi&s;&s;ion; till at la&s;t
&s;ome order, which can &s;upport and maintain it|&s;elf,
is fallen upon. But according to this hypo|the&s;is,
whence ari&s;e the many conveniencies and
advantages, which men and all animals po&s;&s;e&s;s?
Two eyes, two ears, are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the &s;pecies. Human race
might have been propagated and pre&s;erved, without
hor&s;es, dogs, cows, &s;heep, and tho&s;e innumerable
fruits and products, which &s;erve to our &s;atisfac|tion
and enjoyment. If no camels had been cre|ated
for the u&s;e of man in the &s;andy de&s;erts of
AFRICA and ARABIA, would the world have
been di&s;&s;olved? If no load&s;tone had been framed
to give that wonderful and u&s;eful direction to the
needle, would human &s;ociety and the human
kind have been immediately extingui&s;hed?
Though the maxims of Nature be in general very
frugal, yet in&s;tances of this kind are far from be|ing
rare; and any one of them is a &s;ufficient
<PB N="88" REF="90">
proof of de&s;ign, and of a benevolent de&s;ign,
which gave ri&s;e to the order and arrangement of
the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t, you may &s;afely infer, &s;aid PHILO,
that the foregoing hypothe&s;is is &s;o far incomplete
and imperfect; which I &s;hall not &s;cruple to allow.
But can we ever rea&s;onably expect greater &s;uc|ce&s;s
in any attempts of this nature? Or can we
ever hope to erect a &s;y&s;tem of co&s;mogony, that
will be liable to no exceptions, and will contain
no circum&s;tance repugnant to our limited and
imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature?
Your theory it&s;elf cannot &s;urely pretend to any
&s;uch advantage; even though you have run into
<HI>Authropomorphi&s;m,</HI> the better to pre&s;erve a
conformity to common experience. Let us once
more put it to trial. In all in&s;tances which we
have ever &s;een, ideas are copied from real ob|jects,
and are ectypal, not archetypal, to expre&s;s
my&s;elf in learned terms: You rever&s;e this order,
and give thought the precedence. In all in&s;tances
which we have ever &s;een, thought has no in|fluence
upon matter, except where that matter
is &s;o conjoined with it, as to have an equal re|ciprocal
influence upon it. No animal can move
immediately any thing but the members of its
own body; and indeed, the equality of action
and re-action &s;eems to be an univer&s;al law of Na|ture:
But your theory implies a contradiction to
this experience. The&s;e in&s;tances, with many
more, which it were ea&s;y to collect, (particularly
<PB N="89" REF="91">
the &s;uppo&s;ition of a mind or &s;y&s;tem of thought
that is eternal, or in other words, an animal in|generable
and immortal) the&s;e in&s;tances, I &s;ay,
may teach, all of us, &s;obriety in condemning each
other; and let us &s;ee, that as no &s;y&s;tem of this
kind ought ever to be received from a &s;light a|nalogy,
&s;o neither ought any to be rejected on
account of a &s;mall incongruity. For that is an
inconvenience, from which we can ju&s;tly pro|nounce
no one to be exempted.</P>
<P>All religious &s;y&s;tems, it is confe&s;&s;ed, are &s;ub|ject
to great and in&s;uperable difficulties. Each
di&s;putant triumphs in his turn; while he carries
on an offen&s;ive war, and expo&s;es the ab&s;urdities,
barbarities, and pernicious tenets of his antago|ni&s;t.
But all of them, on the whole, prepare a
complete triumph for the <HI>Sceptic;</HI> who tells them,
that no &s;y&s;tem ought ever to be embraced with
regard to &s;uch &s;ubjects: For this plain rea&s;on,
that no ab&s;urdity ought ever to be a&s;&s;ented to with
regard to any &s;ubject. A total &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judge|ment
is here our only rea&s;onable re&s;ource. And
if every attack, as is commonly ob&s;erved, and
no defence, among Theologians, is &s;ucce&s;sful;
how complete mu&s;t be <HI>his</HI> victory, who remains
always, with all mankind, on the offen&s;ive, and
has him&s;elf no fixed &s;tation or abiding city, which
he is ever, on any occa&s;ion, obliged to de&s;end?</P>

<P>BUT if &s;o many difficulties attend the argu|ment
<HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part IX.</NOTE> &s;aid DEMEA; had we not
better adhere to that &s;imple and &s;ublime argument
<HI>a priori,</HI> which, by offering to us infallible de|mon&s;tration,
cuts off at once all doubt and diffi|culty?
By this argument too, we may prove the
INFINITY of the divine attributes, which, I
am afraid, can never be a&s;certained with certainty
from any other topic. For how can an effect,
which either is finite, or, for aught we know,
may be &s;o; how can &s;uch an effect, I &s;ay, prove
an infinite cau&s;e? The unity too of the Divine
Nature, it is very difficult, if not ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible,
to deduce merely from contemplating
the works of nature; nor will the uniformity a|lone
of the plan, even were it allowed, give us
any a&s;&s;urance of that attribute. Whereas the ar|gument
<HI>a priori..</HI>....</P>
<P>You &s;eem to rea&s;on, DEMEA, interpo&s;ed CLE|ANTHES,
as if tho&s;e advantages and convenien|cies
in the ab&s;tract argument were full proofs of
its &s;olidity. But it is fir&s;t proper, in my opinion,
to determine what argument of this nature you
chu&s;e to in&s;i&s;t on; and we &s;hall afterwards, from
it&s;elf, better than from its <HI>u&s;eful</HI> con&s;equences,
endeavour to determine what value we ought to
put upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93">
The argument, replied DEMEA, which I would
in&s;i&s;t on is the common one. Whatever exi&s;ts
mu&s;t have a cau&s;e or rea&s;on of its exi&s;tence; it
being ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for any thing thing to
produce it&s;elf, or be the cau&s;e of its own exi&s;t|ence.
In mounting up, therefore, from effects
to cau&s;es, we mu&s;t either go on in tracing an
infinite &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without any ultimate cau&s;e at
all, or mu&s;t at la&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;ome ulti|mate
cau&s;e, that is <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> exi&s;tent: Now
that the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition is ab&s;urd may be thus
proved. In the infinite chain or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
cau&s;es and effects, each &s;ingle effect is determined
to exi&s;t by the power and efficacy of that cau&s;e,
which immediately preceded; but the whole e|ternal
chain or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, taken together, is not
determined or cau&s;ed by any thing: and yet it
is evident that it requires a cau&s;e or rea&s;on, as
much as any particular object, which begins to
exi&s;t in time. The que&s;tion is &s;till rea&s;onable,
Why this particular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es exi&s;ted
from eternity, and not any other &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or
no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at all. If there be no nece&s;&s;arily-exi&s;tent
being, any &s;uppo&s;ition, which can be
formed, is equally po&s;&s;ible; nor is there any more
ab&s;urdity in Nothing's having exi&s;ted from eter|nity,
than there is in that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es,
which con&s;titutes the univer&s;e. What was it
then, which determined &s;omething to exi&s;t ra|ther
than nothing, and be&s;towed being on a par|ticular
po&s;&s;ibility, exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t? <HI>Exter|nal
<PB N="92" REF="94">
cau&s;es,</HI> there are &s;uppo&s;ed to be none.
<HI>Chance</HI> is a word without a meaning. Was it
<HI>Nothing?</HI> But that can never produce any
thing. We mu&s;t, therefore, have recour&s;e to a
nece&s;&s;arily-exi&s;tent Being, who carries the REA|SON
of his exi&s;tence in him&s;elf; and who can|not
be &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t without an expre&s;s
contradiction. There is con&s;equently &s;uch a Be|ing,
that is, there is a Deity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not leave it to PHILO, &s;aid CLEAN|THES,
(though I know that the &s;tarting objec|tions
is his chief delight) to point out the weak|ne&s;s
of this metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning. It &s;eems to
me &s;o obviou&s;ly ill-grounded, and at the &s;ame
time of &s;o little con&s;equence to the cau&s;e of true
piety and religion, that I &s;hall my&s;elf venture to
&s;how the fallacy of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with ob&s;erving, that there is an
evident ab&s;urdity in pretending to demon&s;trate a
matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments
<HI>a priori.</HI> Nothing is demon&s;trable, unle&s;s the
contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing, that
is di&s;tinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction.
Whatever we conceive as exi&s;tent, we can al&s;o
conceive as non-exi&s;tent. There is no being,
therefore, who&s;e non-exi&s;tence implies a contra|diction.
Con&s;equently there is no being, who&s;e
exi&s;tence is demon&s;trable. I propo&s;e this argu|ment
as entirely deci&s;ive, and am willing to re&s;t
the whole controver&s;y upon it.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the Deity is a nece&s;&s;arily-exi&s;tent
<PB N="93" REF="95">
exi&s;tent being; and this nece&s;&s;ity of his exi&s;t|ence
is attempted to be explained by a&s;&s;erting,
that, if we knew his whole e&s;&s;ence or nature, we
&s;hould perceive it to be as impo&s;&s;ible for him not
to exi&s;t as for twice two not to be four. But it
is evident, that this can never happen, while our
faculties remain the &s;ame as at pre&s;ent. It will
&s;till be po&s;&s;ible for us, at any time, to conceive
the non-exi&s;tence of what we formerly conceived
to exi&s;t; nor can the mind ever lie under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of &s;uppo&s;ing any object to remain always
in being; in the &s;ame manner as we lie under a
nece&s;&s;ity of always conceiving twice two to be
four. The words, therefore, <HI>nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;t|ence,</HI>
have no meaning; or, which is the &s;ame
thing, none that is con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>But farther; why may not the material uni|ver&s;e
be the nece&s;&s;arily-exi&s;tent Being, according
to this pretended explication of nece&s;&s;ity? We
dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of
matter; and for aught we can determine, it may
contain &s;ome qualities, which, were they known,
would make its non-exi&s;tence appear as great a
contradiction as that twice two is five. I find
only one argument employed to prove, that the
material world is not the nece&s;&s;arily-exi&s;tent Be|ing;
and this argument is derived from the con|tingency
both of the matter and the form of the
world. <Q>Any particle of matter,</Q> 'tis &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Clarke.</NOTE>
<PB N="94" REF="96">
<Q>may be <HI>conceived</HI> to be annihilated; and any
form may be <HI>conceived</HI> to be altered. Such
an annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not
impo&s;&s;ible.</Q> But it &s;eems a great partiality
not to perceive, that the &s;ame argument extends
equally to the Deity, &s;o far as we have any con|ception
of him; and that the mind can at lea&s;t
imagine him to be non-exi&s;tent, or his attributes
to be altered. It mu&s;t be &s;ome unknown, in|conceivable
qualities, which can make his non|exi&s;tence
appear impo&s;&s;ible, or his attributes un|alterable:
And no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why
the&s;e qualities may not belong to matter. As
they are altogether unknown and inconceivable,
they can never be proved incompatible with it.</P>
<P>Add to this, that in tracing an eternal &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of objects, it &s;eems ab&s;urd to enquire for a
general cau&s;e or fir&s;t author. How can any
thing, that exi&s;ts from eternity, have a cau&s;e;
&s;ince that relation implies a priority in time and a
beginning of exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>In &s;uch a chain too, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects,
each part is cau&s;ed by that which preceded it,
and cau&s;es that which &s;ucceeds it. Where then
is the difficulty? But the WHOLE, you
&s;ay, wants a cau&s;e. I an&s;wer, that the uniting
of the&s;e parts into a whole, like the uniting of
&s;everal di&s;tinct counties into one kingdom, or
&s;everal di&s;tinct members into one body, is per|formed
merely by an arbitrary act of the mind,
and has no influence on the nature of things.
Did I &s;how you the particular cau&s;es of each in|dividual
<PB N="95" REF="97">
in a collection of twenty particles of
matter, I &s;hould think it very unrea&s;onable, &s;hould
you afterwards a&s;k me, what was the cau&s;e of
the whole twenty. That is &s;ufficiently explained
in explaining the cau&s;e of the parts.</P>
<P>Though the rea&s;onings, which you have urged,
CLEANTHES, may well excu&s;e me, &s;aid PHILO,
from &s;tarting any farther difficulties; yet I can|not
forbear in&s;i&s;ting &s;till upon another topic.
'Tis ob&s;erved by arithmeticians, that the products
of 9 compo&s;e always either 9 or &s;ome le&s;&s;er pro|duct
of 9; if you add together all the characters,
of which any of the former products is compo&s;ed.
Thus, of 18, 27, 36, which are products of 9,
you make 9 by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6.
Thus 369 is a product al&s;o of 9; and if you add
3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a le&s;&s;er product of
9<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Republique des Lettres, Aout, 1685.</NOTE>. To a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, &s;o wonderful a
regularity may be admired as the effect either of
chance or de&s;ign; but a &s;kilful algebrai&s;t imme|diately
concludes it to be the work of nece&s;&s;ity,
and demon&s;trates, that it mu&s;t for ever re&s;ult
from the nature of the&s;e numbers. Is it not pro|bable,
I a&s;k, that the whole oeconomy of the u|niver&s;e
is conducted by a like nece&s;&s;ity, though
no human algebra can furni&s;h a key, which &s;olves
the difficulty? And in&s;tead of admiring the or|der
of natural beings, may it not happen, that,
could we penetrate into the intimate nature of
<PB N="96" REF="98">
bodies, we &s;hould clearly &s;ee why it was ab&s;olute|ly
impo&s;&s;ible, they could ever admit of any other
di&s;po&s;ition? So dangerous is it to introduce this
idea of nece&s;&s;ity into the pre&s;ent que&s;tion! and
&s;o naturally does it afford an inference directly
oppo&s;ite to the religious hypothe&s;is!</P>
<P>But dropping all the&s;e ab&s;tractions, continued
PHILO; and confining our&s;elves to more familiar
topics; I &s;hall venture to add an ob&s;ervation,
that the argument <HI>a priori</HI> has &s;eldom been found
very convincing, except to people of a metaphy|&s;ical
head, who have accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to
ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, and who finding from mathe|matics,
that the under&s;tanding frequently leads
to truth, through ob&s;curity, and contrary to fir&s;t
appearances, have transferred the &s;ame habit of
thinking to &s;ubjects, where it ought not to have
place. Other people, even of good &s;en&s;e and
the be&s;t inclined to religion, feel always &s;ome de|ficiency
in &s;uch arguments, though they are not
perhaps able to explain di&s;tinctly where it lies.

<P>IT is my opinion, I own, replied DEMEA,
that each man feels, in a manner, the truth of
religion within his own brea&s;t; and from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="97" REF="99">
of his imbecility and mi&s;ery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part. X.</NOTE> rather than
from any rea&s;oning, is led to &s;eek protection from
that Being, on whom he and all nature is de|pendent.
So anxious or &s;o tedious are even the
be&s;t &s;eenes of life, that futurity is &s;till the object
of all our hopes and fears. We ince&s;&s;antly look
forward, and endeavour, by prayers, adoration,
and &s;acrifice, to appea&s;e tho&s;e unknown powers,
whom we find, by experience, &s;o able to afflict
and oppre&s;s us. Wretched creatures that we are!
what re&s;ource for us amid&s;t the innumerable ills
of life, did not Religion &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome methods
of atonement, and appea&s;e tho&s;e terrors, with
which we are ince&s;&s;antly agitated and tormented?</P>
<P>I am indeed per&s;uaded, &s;aid PHILO, that the
be&s;t and indeed the only method of bringing e|very
one to a due &s;en&s;e of religion, is by ju&s;t re|pre&s;entations
of the mi&s;ery and wickedne&s;s of
men. And for that purpo&s;e a talent of eloquence
and &s;trong imagery is more requi&s;ite than that of
rea&s;oning and argument. For is it nece&s;&s;ary to
prove, what every one feels within him&s;elf? 'Tis
only nece&s;&s;ary to make us feel it, if po&s;&s;ible,
more intimately and &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>The people, indeed, replied DEMEA, are
&s;ufficiently convinced of this great and melancholy
truth. The mi&s;eries of life, the unhappine&s;s of
man, the general corruptions of our nature, the
un&s;atisfactory enjoyment of plea&s;ures, riches, ho|nours;
the&s;e phra&s;es have become almo&s;t pro|verbial
<PB N="98" REF="100">
in all languages. And who can doubt of
what all men declare from their own immediate
feeling and experience?</P>
<P>In this point, &s;aid PHILO, the learned are
perfectly agreed with the vulgar; and in all let|ters,
<HI>&s;acred</HI> and <HI>profane,</HI> the topic of human
mi&s;ery has been in&s;i&s;ted on with the mo&s;t pathetic
eloquence, that &s;orrow and melancholy could
in&s;pire. The poets, who &s;peak from &s;entiment,
without a &s;y&s;tem, and who&s;e te&s;timony has there|fore
the more authority, abound in images of this
nature. From HOMER down to Dr YOUNG,
the whole in&s;pired tribe have ever been &s;en&s;ible,
that no other repre&s;entation of things would
&s;uit the feeling and ob&s;ervation of each indivi|dual.</P>
<P>As to authorities, replied DEMEA, you need
not &s;eek them. Look round this library of
CLEANTHES. I &s;hall venture to affirm, that,
except authors of particular &s;ciences, &s;uch as chy|mi&s;try
or botany, who have no occa&s;ion to treat
of human life, there is &s;carce one of tho&s;e innu|merable
writers, from whom the &s;en&s;e of human
mi&s;ery has not, in &s;ome pa&s;&s;age or other, extort|ed
a complaint and confe&s;&s;ion of it. At lea&s;t,
the chance is entirely on that &s;ide; and no one
author has ever, &s;o far as I can recollect, been
&s;o extravagant as to deny it.</P>
<P>There you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, &s;aid PHILO:
LEIBNITZ has denied it; and is perhaps the
<PB N="99" REF="101">
fir&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That &s;entiment had been maintained by Dr King and &s;ome few others before LEIBNITZ; though by none of &s;o great fame as that GERMAN philo&s;opher.</NOTE>, who ventured upon &s;o bold and para|doxical
an opinion; at lea&s;t, the fir&s;t, who made
it e&s;&s;ential to his philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>And by being the fir&s;t, replied DEMEA, might
he not have been &s;en&s;ible of his error? For is
this a &s;ubject, in which philo&s;ophers can propo&s;e
to make di&s;coveries, e&s;pecially in &s;o late an age?
And can any man hope by a &s;imple denial (for
the &s;ubject &s;carcely admits of rea&s;oning) to bear
down the united te&s;timony of mankind, founded
on &s;en&s;e and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>And why &s;hould man, added he, pretend to
an exemption from the lot of all other animals?
The whole earth, believe me, PHILO, is cur&s;ed
and polluted. A perpetual war is kindled a|mong&s;t
all living creatures. Nece&s;&s;ity, hunger,
want, &s;timulate the &s;trong and courageous: Fear,
anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and infirm.
The fir&s;t entrance into life gives angui&s;h to the
new-born infant and to its wretched parent:
Weakne&s;s, impotence, di&s;tre&s;s, attend each &s;tage
of that life: and 'tis at la&s;t fini&s;hed in agony and
horror.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve too, &s;ays PHILO, the curious artifices
of Nature, in order to imbitter the life of every
living being. The &s;tronger prey upon the weaker,
<PB N="100" REF="102">
and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety.
The weaker too, in their turn, often prey upon
the &s;tronger, and vex and mole&s;t them without
relaxation. Con&s;ider that innumerable race of
in&s;ects, which either are bred on the body of each
animal, or flying about infix their &s;tings in him.
The&s;e in&s;ects have others &s;till le&s;s than them&s;elves,
which torment them. And thus on each hand,
before and behind, above and below, every ani|mal
is &s;urrounded with enemies, which ince&s;&s;antly
&s;eek his mi&s;ery and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Man alone, &s;aid DEMEA, &s;eems to be, in part,
an exception to this rule. For by combination in
&s;ociety, he can ea&s;ily ma&s;ter lions, tygers, and
bears, who&s;e greater &s;trength and agility natural|ly
enable them to prey upon him.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it is here chiefly, cried PHI|LO,
that the uniform and equal maxims of Na|ture
are mo&s;t apparent. Man, it is true, can, by
combination, &s;urmount all his <HI>real</HI> enemies, and
become ma&s;ter of the whole animal creation: but
does he not immediately rai&s;e up to him&s;elf <HI>ima|ginary</HI>
enemies, the daemons of his fancy, who
haunt him with &s;uper&s;titious terrors, and bla&s;t e|very
enjoyment of life? His plea&s;ure, as he
imagines, becomes, in their eyes, a crime: his
food and repo&s;e give them umbrage and offence:
his very &s;leep and dreams furni&s;h new materials
to anxious fear: and even death, his refuge
from every other ill, pre&s;ents only the dread of
endle&s;s and innumerable woes. Nor does the
<PB N="101" REF="103">
wolf mole&s;t more the timid flock, than &s;uper&s;ti|tion
does the anxious brea&s;t of wretched mortals.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, con&s;ider, DEMEA; this very &s;ociety, by
which we &s;urmount tho&s;e wild bea&s;ts, our natural
enemies; what new enemies does it not rai&s;e to
us? What woe and mi&s;ery does it not occa&s;ion?
Man is the greate&s;t enemy of man. Oppre&s;&s;ion,
inju&s;tice, contempt, contumely, violence, &s;edi|tion,
war, calumny, treachery, fraud; by the&s;e
they mutually torment each other: and they
would &s;oon di&s;&s;olve that &s;ociety which they had
formed, were it not for the dread of &s;till greater
ills, which mu&s;t attend their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e external in&s;ults, &s;aid DEMEA,
from animals, from men, from all the elements,
which a&s;&s;ault us, form a frightful catalogue of
woes, they are nothing in compari&s;on of tho&s;e,
which ari&s;e within our&s;elves, from the di&s;temper|ed
condition of our mind and body. How many
lie under the lingering torment of di&s;ea&s;es? Hear
the pathetic enumeration of the great poet.</P>
<Q><L>Inte&s;tine &s;tone and ulcer, colic-pangs,</L>
<L>Daemoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,</L>
<L>And moon-&s;truck madne&s;s, pining atrophy,</L>
<L>Mara&s;mus and wide-wa&s;ting pe&s;tilence.</L>
<L>Dire was the to&s;&s;ing, deep the groans: DESPAIR</L>
<L>Tended the &s;ick, bu&s;ie&s;t from couch to couch.</L>
<L>And over them triumphant DEATH his dart</L>
<L>Shook, but delay'd to &s;trike, tho' oft invok'd</L>
<L>With vows, as their chief good and final hope.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">
The di&s;orders of the mind, continued DEMEA,
though more &s;ecret, are not perhaps le&s;s di&s;mal
and vexatious. Remor&s;e, &s;hame, angui&s;h, rage,
di&s;appointment, anxiety, fear, dejection, de&s;pair;
who has ever pa&s;&s;ed through life without cruel in|roads
from the&s;e tormentors? How many have
&s;carcely ever felt any better &s;en&s;ations? Labour
and poverty, &s;o abhorred by every one, are the
certain lot of the far greater number: and tho&s;e
few privileged per&s;ons, who enjoy ea&s;e and opu|lence,
never reach contentment or true felicity.
All the goods of life united would not make a
very happy man: but all the ills united would
make a wretch indeed; and any one of them al|mo&s;t
(and who can be free from every one) nay
often the ab&s;ence of one good (and who can po&s;|&s;e&s;s
all) is &s;ufficient to render life ineligible.</P>
<P>Were a &s;tranger to drop, on a &s;udden, into this
world, I would &s;how him, as a &s;pecimen of its
ills, an ho&s;pital full of di&s;ea&s;es, a pri&s;on crowded
with malefactors and debtors, a field of battle
&s;trowed with carca&s;es, a fleet foundering in the
ocean, a nation langui&s;hing under tyranny, fa|mine,
or pe&s;tilence. To turn the gay &s;ide of life
to him, and give him a notion of its plea&s;ures;
whither &s;hould I conduct him? to a ball, to an
opera, to court? He might ju&s;tly think, that I
was only &s;howing him a diver&s;ity of di&s;tre&s;s and
&s;orrow.</P>
<P>There is no evading &s;uch &s;triking in&s;tances,
&s;aid PHILO, but by apologies, which &s;till farther
<PB N="103" REF="105">
aggravate the charge. Why have all men, I a&s;k,
in all ages, complained ince&s;&s;antly of the mi&s;eries
of life?. &mdash; They have no ju&s;t rea&s;on, &s;ays one:
the&s;e complaints proceed only from their di&s;con|tented,
repining, anxious di&s;po&s;ition &mdash; And
can there po&s;&s;ibly, I reply, be a more certain
foundation of mi&s;ery, than &s;uch a wretched tem|per?</P>
<P>But if they were really as unhappy as they pre|tend,
&s;ays my antagoni&s;t, why do they remain in
life? &mdash;.</P>
<Q>Not &s;atisfied with life, afraid of death.</Q>
<P>This is the &s;ecret chain, &s;ay I, that holds us. We
are terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is only a fal&s;e delicacy, he may in&s;i&s;t, which
a few refined &s;pirits indulge, and which has &s;pread
the&s;e complaints among the whole race of man|kind.
 &mdash; And what is this delicacy, I a&s;k,
which you blame? Is it any thing but a greater
&s;en&s;ibility to all the plea&s;ures and pains of life?
and if the man of a delicate, refined temper, by
being &s;o much more alive than the re&s;t of the
world, is only &s;o much more unhappy; what
judgement mu&s;t we form in general of human
life?</P>
<P>Let men remain at re&s;t, &s;ays our adver&s;ary;
and they will be ea&s;y. They are willing artificers
of their own mi&s;ery. &mdash; No! reply I; an an|xious
<PB N="104" REF="106">
languor follows their repo&s;e: di&s;appoint|ment,
vexation, trouble, their activity and ambi|tion.</P>
<P>I can ob&s;erve &s;omething like what you mention
in &s;ome others, replied CLEANTHES: but I con|fe&s;s,
I feel little or nothing of it in my&s;elf; and
hope that it is not &s;o common as you repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>If you feel not human mi&s;ery your&s;elf, cried
DEMEA, I congratulate you on &s;o happy a &s;ingu|larity.
Others, &s;eemingly the mo&s;t pro&s;perous,
have not been a&s;hamed to vent their complaints in
the mo&s;t melancholy &s;trains. Let us attend to the
great, the fortunate Emperor, CHARLES V,
when, tired with human grandeur, he re&s;igned
all his exten&s;ive dominions into the hands of his
&s;on. In the la&s;t harangue, which he made on
that memorable occa&s;ion, he publicly avowed,
<HI>that the greate&s;t pro&s;perities which he had e|ver
enjoyed, had been mixed with &s;o many ad|ver&s;ities,
that he might truly &s;ay he had never
enjoyed any &s;atisfaction or contentment</HI> But
did the retired life, in which he &s;ought for &s;helter,
afford him any greater happine&s;s? If we may
credit his &s;on's account, his repentance commen|ced
the very day of his re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>CICERO's fortune, from &s;mall beginnings, ro&s;e
to the greate&s;t lu&s;tre and renown; yet what pa|thetic
complaints of the ills of life do his familiar
letters, as well as philo&s;ophical di&s;cour&s;es, con|tain?
And &s;uitably to his own experience, he in|troduces
CATO, the great, the fortunate CATO,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
prote&s;ting in his old age, that, had he a new life
in his offer, he would reject the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A&s;k your&s;elf, a&s;k any of your acquaintance,
whether they would live over again the la&s;t ten or
twenty years of their life. No! but the next
twenty, they &s;ay, will be better:
<Q><L>And from the dregs of life, hope to receive</L>
<L>What the fir&s;t &s;prightly running could not give.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus at la&s;t they find (&s;uch is the greatne&s;s of hu|man
mi&s;ery; it reconciles even contradictions)
that they complain, at once, of the &s;hortne&s;s of
life, and of its vanity and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>And is it po&s;&s;ible, CLEANTHES, &s;aid PHILO,
that after all the&s;e reflections, and infinitely more,
which might be &s;ugge&s;ted, you can &s;till per&s;evere
in your Anthropomorphi&s;m, and a&s;&s;ert the moral
attributes of the Deity, his ju&s;tice, benevolence,
mercy, and rectitude, to be of the &s;ame nature
with the&s;e virtues in human creatures? His
power we allow infinite: whatever he wills is exe|cuted:
but neither man nor any other animal are
happy: therefore he does not will their happi|ne&s;s.
His wi&s;dom is infinite: he is never mi&s;ta|ken
in chu&s;ing the means to any end: but the
cour&s;e of Nature tends not to human or animal
felicity: therefore it is not e&s;tabli&s;hed for that
purpo&s;e. Through the whole compa&s;s of human
knowledge, there are no inferences more certain
and infallible than the&s;e. In what re&s;pect, then,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
do his benevolence and mercy re&s;emble the bene|volence
and mercy of men?</P>
<P>EPICURUS's old que&s;tions are yet unan&s;wered.</P>
<P>Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able?
then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing?
then is he malevolent. Is he both able and will|ing?
whence then is evil?</P>
<P>You a&s;cribe, CLEANTHES, (and I believe
ju&s;tly) a purpo&s;e and intention to Nature. But
what, I be&s;eech you, is the object of that curious
artifice and machinery, which &s;he has di&s;played in
all animals? The pre&s;ervation alone of individuals
and propagation of the &s;pecies. It &s;eems enough
for her purpo&s;e, if &s;uch a rank be barely upheld
in the univer&s;e, without any care or concern for
the happine&s;s of the members, that compo&s;e it.
No re&s;ource for this purpo&s;e: no machinery, in
order merely to give plea&s;ure or ea&s;e: no fund of
pure joy and contentment: no indulgence without
&s;ome want or nece&s;&s;ity, accompanying it. At
lea&s;t, the &s;ew phenomena of this nature are over|balanced
by oppo&s;ite phenomena of &s;till greater
importance.</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;e of mu&s;ic, harmony, and indeed
beauty of all kinds gives &s;atisfaction, without be|ing
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation and
propagation of the &s;pecies. But what racking
pains, on the other hand, ari&s;e from gouts, gra|vels,
megrims, tooth-achs, rheumati&s;ms; where
the injury to the animal-machinery is either &s;mall
or incurable? Mirth, laughter, play, frolic, &s;eem
<PB N="107" REF="109">
gratuitous &s;atisfactions, which have no farther
tendency: &s;pleen, melancholy, di&s;content, &s;uper|&s;tition,
are pains of the &s;ame nature. How then
does the divine benevolence di&s;play it&s;elf, in the
&s;en&s;e of you Anthropomorphites? None but
we My&s;tics, as you were plea&s;ed to call us, can
account for this &s;trange mixture of phenomena,
by deriving it from attributes, infinitely perfect,
but incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>And have you at la&s;t, &s;aid CLEANTHES &s;mi|ling,
betrayed your intentions, PHILO? Your
long agreement with DEMEA did indeed a little
&s;urpri&s;e me; but I find you were all the while
crecting a concealed battery again&s;t me. And I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, that you have now fallen upon a
&s;ubject, worthy of your noble &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition
and controver&s;y. If you can make out the pre|&s;ent
point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or
corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion.
For to what purpo&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h the natural attributes
of the Deity, while the moral are &s;till doubtful
and uncertain?</P>
<P>You take umbrage very ea&s;ily, replied DEMEA,
at opinions the mo&s;t innocent, and the mo&s;t ge|nerally
received even among&s;t the religious and
devout them&s;elves: and nothing can be more &s;ur|pri&s;ing
than to find a topic like this, concerning
the wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of man, charged with
no le&s;s than Athei&s;m and profanene&s;s. Have not
all pious divines and preachers, who have indul|ged
their rhetoric on &s;o fertile a &s;ubject; have
<PB N="108" REF="110">
they not ea&s;ily, I &s;ay, given a &s;olution of any dif|ficulties,
which may attend it? This world is but
a point in compari&s;on of the univer&s;e: this life
but a moment in compari&s;on of eternity. The
pre&s;ent evil phenomena, therefore, are rectified
in other regions, and in &s;ome future period of ex|i&s;tence.
And the eyes of men, being then open|ed
to larger views of things, &s;ee the whole con|nection
of general laws, and trace, with adora|tion,
the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity,
through all the mazes and intricacies of his provi|dence.</P>
<P>No! replied CLEANTHES, No! The&s;e arbi|trary
&s;uppo&s;itions can never be admitted, con|trary
to matter of fact, vi&s;ible and uncontrovert|ed.
Whence can any cau&s;e be known but from
its known effects? Whence can any hypothe&s;is
be proved but from the apparent phenomena?
To e&s;tabli&s;h one hypothe&s;is upon another is build|ing
entirely in the air; and the utmo&s;t we ever
attain, by the&s;e conjectures and fictions, is to
a&s;certain the bare po&s;&s;ibility of our opinion; but
never can we, upon &s;uch terms, e&s;tabli&s;h its
reality.</P>
<P>The only method of &s;upporting divine bene|volence
(and it is what I willingly embrace) is
to deny ab&s;olutely the mi&s;ery and wickedne&s;s
of man. Your repre&s;entations are exaggera|ted:
Your melancholy views mo&s;tly fictitious:
Your inferences contrary to fact and experience.
Health is more common than &s;ickne&s;s: Plea&s;ure
than pain: Happine&s;s than mi&s;ery. And for one
<PB N="109" REF="111">
vexation, which we meet with, we attain, upon
computation, a hundred enjoyments.</P>
<P>Admitting your po&s;ition, replied PHILO, which
yet is extremely doubtful; you mu&s;t, at the
&s;ame time, allow, that, if pain be le&s;s frequent
than plea&s;ure, it is infinitely more violent and
durable. One hour of it is often able to out|weigh
a day, a week, a month of our common
in&s;ipid enjoyments: And how many days, weeks,
and months are pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal in the mo&s;t a|cute
torments? Plea&s;ure, &s;carcely in one in&s;tance,
is ever able to reach ec&s;ta&s;y and rapture: And
in no one in&s;tance can it continue for any time
at its highe&s;t pitch and altitude. The &s;pirits e|vaporate;
the nerves relax; the fabric is di&s;or|dered;
and the enjoyment quickly degenerates
into fatigue and unea&s;ine&s;s. But pain often,
good God, how often! ri&s;es to torture and a|gony;
and the longer it continues, it becomes
&s;till more genuine agony and torture. Patience
is exhau&s;ted; courage langui&s;hes; melancholy
&s;eizes us; and nothing terminates our mi&s;ery but
the removal of its cau&s;e, or another event, which
is the &s;ole cure of all evil, but which, from our
natural folly, we regard with &s;till greater horror
and con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>But not to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e topics, continued
PHILO, though mo&s;t obvious, certain, and im|portant;
I mu&s;t u&s;e the freedom to admoni&s;h
you, CLEANTHES, that you have put the con|trover&s;y
upon a mo&s;t dangerous i&s;&s;ue, and are,
<PB N="110" REF="112">
unawares introducing a total Sceptici&s;m into the
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles of natural and revealed the|ology.
What! no method of fixing a ju&s;t foun|dation
for religion, unle&s;s we allow the happine&s;s
of human life, and maintain a continued exi&s;t|ence
even in this world, with all our pre&s;ent pains,
infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible
and de&s;ireable! But this is contrary to every one's
feeling and experience: It is contrary to an au|thority
&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed as nothing can &s;ubvert:
No deci&s;ive proofs can ever be produced again&s;t
this authority; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for you to com|pute,
e&s;timate, and compare all the pains and all
the plea&s;ures in the lives of all men and of all a|nimals:
And thus by your re&s;ting the whole &s;y|&s;tem
of religion on a point, which, from its very
nature, mu&s;t for ever be uncertain, you tacitly
confe&s;s, that that &s;y&s;tem is equally uncertain.</P>
<P>But allowing you, what never will be be|lieved;
at lea&s;t, what you never po&s;&s;ibly can
prove, that animal, or at lea&s;t, human happine&s;s
in this life exceeds its mi&s;ery; you have yet done
nothing: For this is not, by any means, what
we expect from infinite power, infinite wi&s;dom,
and infinite goodne&s;s. Why is there any mi&s;ery
at all in the world? Not by chance &s;urely. From
&s;ome cau&s;e then. Is it from the intention of the
Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it
contrary to his intention? But he is almighty.
Nothing can &s;hake the &s;olidity of this rea&s;oning,
&s;o &s;hort, &s;o clear, &s;o deci&s;ive; except we a&s;&s;ert,
<PB N="111" REF="113">
that the&s;e &s;ubjects exceed all human capacity,
and that our common mea&s;ures of truth and fal&s;e|hood
are not applicable to them; a topic, which
I have all along in&s;i&s;ted on, but which you have,
from the beginning, rejected with &s;corn and in|dignation.</P>
<P>But I will be contented to retire &s;till from this
intrenchment: For I deny that you can ever force
me in it: I will allow, that pain or mi&s;ery in man
is <HI>compatible</HI> with infinite power and goodne&s;s
in the Deity, even in your &s;en&s;e of the&s;e attri|butes:
What are you advanced by all the&s;e con|ce&s;&s;ions?
A mere po&s;&s;ible compatibility is not
&s;ufficient. You mu&s;t <HI>prove</HI> the&s;e pure, unmixt,
and uncontrollable attributes from the pre&s;ent
mixt and confu&s;ed phenomena, and from the&s;e
alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the phe|nomena
ever &s;o pure and unmixt, yet being
finite, they would be in&s;ufficient for that pur|po&s;e.
How much more, where they are al&s;o &s;o
jarring and di&s;cordant?</P>
<P>Here, CLEANTHES, I find my&s;elf at ea&s;e in
my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when
we argued concerning the natural attributes of
intelligence and de&s;ign, I needed all my &s;cepti|cal
and metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilty to elude your gra&s;p.
In many views of the univer&s;e, and of its parts,
particularly the latter, the beauty and fitne&s;s of
final cau&s;es &s;trike us with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible force,
that all objections appear (what I believe they
really are) mere cavils and &s;ophi&s;ms; nor can
<PB N="112" REF="114">
we then imagine how it was ever po&s;&s;ible for us
to repo&s;e any weight on them. But there is no
view of human life or of the condition of man|kind,
from which, without the greate&s;t violence,
we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that
infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power
and infinite wi&s;dom, which we mu&s;t di&s;cover by
the eyes of faith alone. It is your turn now to
tug the labouring oar, and to &s;upport your phi|lo&s;ophical
&s;ubtilties again&s;t the dictates of plain
rea&s;on and experience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART XI.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;cruple not to allow, &s;aid CLEANTHES, that
I have been apt to &s;u&s;pect the frequent repetition
of the word, <HI>infinite,</HI> which we meet with in all
theological writers, to favour more of panegyric
than of philo&s;ophy, and that any purpo&s;es of
rea&s;oning, and even of religion, would be better
&s;erved, were we to re&s;t contented with more ac|curate
and more moderate expre&s;&s;ions. The
terms, <HI>admirable, excellent, &s;uperlatively great,
wi&s;e, and holy;</HI> the&s;e &s;ufficiently fill the imagi|nations
of men; and any thing beyond, be&s;ides
that it leads into ab&s;urdities, has no influence on
the affections or &s;entiments. Thus, in the pre|&s;ent
&s;ubject, if we abandon all human analogy,
as &s;eems your intention, DEMEA, I am afraid
we abandon all religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ words"> retain no concep|tion
<PB N="113" REF="115">
of the great object of our adoration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part XI.</NOTE> If we
pre&s;erve human analogy, we mu&s;t for ever find
it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile any mixture of evil in
the univer&s;e with infinite attributes; much le&s;s,
can we ever prove the latter from the former.
But &s;uppo&s;ing the Author of Nature to be finite|ly
perfect, though far exceeding mankind; a
&s;atisfactory account may then be given of natural
and moral evil, and every untoward phenome|non
be explained and adju&s;ted. A le&s;s evil may
then be cho&s;en, in order to avoid a greater: In|conveniencies
be &s;ubmitted to, in order to reach
a de&s;irable end: And in a word, benevolence,
regulated by wi&s;dom, and limited by nece&s;&s;ity,
may produce ju&s;t &s;uch a world as the pre&s;ent.
You, PHILO, who are &s;o prompt at &s;tarting
views, and reflections, and analogies; I would
gladly hear, at length, without interruption, your
opinion of this new theory; and if it de&s;erve our
attention, we may afterwards, at more lei&s;ure,
reduce it into form.</P>
<P>My &s;entiments, replied PHILO, are not worth
being made a my&s;tery of; and therefore, with|out
any ceremony, I &s;hall deliver what occurs to
me, with regard to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. It mu&s;t,
I think, be allowed, that, if a very limited intel|ligence,
whom we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e utterly unac|quainted
with the univer&s;e, were a&s;&s;ured, that it
were the production of a very good, wi&s;e, and
powerful being, however finite, he would, from
his conjectures, form <HI>beforehand</HI> a different
<PB N="114" REF="116">
notion of it from what we find it to be by expe|rience;
nor would he ever imagine, merely from
the&s;e attributes of the cau&s;e, of which he is in|formed,
that the effect could be &s;o full of vice
and mi&s;ery and di&s;order, as it appears in this life.
Suppo&s;ing now, that this per&s;on were brought
into the world, &s;till a&s;&s;ured, that it was the work|man&s;hip
of &s;uch a &s;ublime and benevolent Being;
he might, perhaps, be &s;urpri&s;ed at the di&s;ap|pointment;
but would never retract his former
belief, if founded on any very &s;olid argument;
&s;ince &s;uch a limited intelligence mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible
of his own blindne&s;s and ignorance, and mu&s;t
allow, that there may be many &s;olutions of tho&s;e
phenomena, which will for ever e&s;cape his com|prehen&s;ion.
But &s;uppo&s;ing, which is the real
ca&s;e with regard to man, that this creature is
not antecedently convinced of a &s;upreme intelli|gence,
benevolent, and powerful, but is left to
gather &s;uch a belief from the appearances of
things; this entirely alters the ca&s;e, nor will he
ever find any rea&s;on for &s;uch a conclu&s;ion. He may
be fully convinced of the narrow limits of his
under&s;tanding; but this will not help him in
forming an inference concerning the goodne&s;s of
&s;uperior powers, &s;ince he mu&s;t form that inference
from what he knows, not from what he is igno|rant
of. The more you exaggerate his weakne&s;s
and ignorance, the more diffident you render
him, and give him the greater &s;u&s;picion, that
&s;uch &s;ubjects are beyond the reach of his fa|culties.
<PB N="115" REF="117">
You are obliged, therefore, to rea&s;on

&s;tairs, and the whole oeconomy of the building
were the &s;ource of noi&s;e, confu&s;ion, fatigue, dark|ne&s;s,
and the extremes of heat and cold; you
would certainly blame the contrivance, without
any farther examination. The architect would
in vain di&s;play his &s;ubtilty, and prove to you, that
if this door or that window were altered, great|er
ills would en&s;ue. What he &s;ays, may be
&s;trictly true: The alternation of one particular,
while the other parts of the building remain, may
only augment the inconveniencies. But &s;till you
would a&s;&s;ert in general, that, if architect had
had &s;kill and good intentions, he might have form|ed
&s;uch a plan of the whole, and might have
adju&s;ted the parts in &s;uch a manner, as would
have remedied all or mo&s;t of the&s;e inconvenien|cies.
His ignorance, or even your own igno|rance
of &s;uch a plan, will never convince you of
the impo&s;&s;ibility of it. If you find many incon|veniencies
and deformities in the building, you
will always, without entering into any detail,
condemn the architect.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I repeat the question: Is the world,
con&s;idered in general, and as it appears to us in
<PB N="116" REF="118">
this life, different from what a man or &s;uch a li|mited
Being would, <HI>beforehand,</HI> expect from
a very powerful, wi&s;e, and benevolent Deity?
It mu&s;t be &s;trange prejudice to a&s;&s;ert the contrary.
And form thence I conclude, that, however con|&s;i&s;tent
the world may be, allowing certain &s;uppo|&s;itions
and conjectures, with the idea of &s;uch a
Deity, it can never afford us an inference con|cerning
his exi&s;tence. The con&s;i&s;tence is not
ab&s;olutely denied, only the inference. Conjec|tures,
e&s;pecially where infinity is excluded from
the divine attributes, may, perhaps, be &s;ufficient
to prove a con&s;i&s;tence; but can never be founda|tions
for any inference.</P>
<P>There &s;eem to be <HI>four</HI> circum&s;tances, on
which depend all, or the greate&s;t part of the ills,
that mole&s;t &s;en&s;ible creatures; and it is not impo&s;|&s;ible
but all the&s;e circum&s;tances may be nece&s;&s;ary
and unavoidable. We know &s;o little beyond
common life, or even of common life, that, with
regard to the oeconomy of a univer&s;e, there is no
conjecture, however wild, which may not be
ju&s;t; nor any one, however plau&s;ible, which
may not be erroneous. All that belongs to hu|man
under&s;tanding, in this deep ignorance and
ob&s;curity, is to be &s;ceptical, or at lea&s;t cautious;
and not to admit of any hypothe&s;is, whatever;
much le&s;s, of any which is &s;upported by no ap|pearance
of probability. Now this I a&s;&s;ert to be
the ca&s;e with regard to all the cau&s;es of evil, and
the circum&s;tances, on which it depends. None
<PB N="117" REF="119">
of them appear to human rea&s;on, in the lea&s;t
degree, nece&s;&s;ary or unavoidable; nor can we
&s;uppo&s;e them &s;uch, without the utmo&s;t licence of
imagination.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> circum&s;tance which introduces evil, is
that contrivance or oeconomy of the animal crea|tion,
by which pains, as well as plea&s;ures, are
employed to excite all creatures to action, and
make them vigilant in the great work of &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation.
Now plea&s;ure alone, in its various de|grees,
&s;eems to human under&s;tanding &s;ufficient
for this prupo&s;e. All animals might be con&s;tantly
in a &s;tate of enjoyment; but when urged by any
of the nece&s;&s;ities of nature, &s;uch as thir&s;t, hun|ger,
wearine&s;s; in&s;tead of pain, they might feel
a diminution of plea&s;ure, by which they might be
prompted to &s;eek that object, which is nece&s;&s;ary
to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Men pur&s;ue plea&s;ure as ea|gerly
as they avoid pain; at lea&s;t, might have
been &s;o con&s;tituted. It &s;eems, therefore, plainly
po&s;&s;ible to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of life without
any pain. Why then is any animal ever render|ed
&s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation? If animals
can be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a
perpetual exemption from it; and it required as
particular a contrivance of their organs to produce
that feeling, as to endow them with &s;ight, hear|ing,
or any of the &s;en&s;es. Shall we conjecture,
that &s;uch a contrivance was nece&s;&s;ary, without any
appearance of rea&s;on? and &s;hall we build on that
conjecture as on the mo&s;t certain truth?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
But a capacity of pain would not alone pro|duce
pain, were it not for the <HI>&s;econd</HI> circum|&s;tance,
<HI>viz.</HI> the conducting of the world by ge|neral
laws; and this &s;eems no wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to a
very perfect being. It is true; if every thing
were conducted by particular volitions, the cour&s;e
of nature would be perpetually broken, and no
man could employ his rea&s;on in the conduct of
life. But might not other particular volitions re|medy
this inconvenience? In &s;hort, might not
the Deity exterminate all ill, where-ever it were
to be found; and produce all good, without any
preparation or long progre&s;s of cau&s;es and effects?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, according to
the pre&s;ent oeconomy of the world, the cour&s;e of
Nature, though &s;uppo&s;ed exactly regular, yet to
us appears not &s;o, and many events are uncertain,
and many di&s;appoint our expectations. Health
and &s;ickne&s;s, calm and tempe&s;t, with an infinite
number of other accidents, who&s;e cau&s;es are un|known
and variable, have a great influence both
on the fortunes of particular per&s;ons and on the
pro&s;perity of public &s;ocieties: and indeed all hu|man
life, in a manner, depends on &s;uch acci|dents.
A being, therefore, who knows the &s;ecret
&s;prings of the univer&s;e, might ea&s;ily, by particu|lar
volitions, turn all the&s;e accidents to the good
of mankind, and render the whole world happy,
without di&s;covering him&s;elf in any operation. A
fleet, who&s;e purpo&s;es were &s;alutary to &s;ociety,
might always meet with a fair wind: Good princes
<PB N="119" REF="121">
enjoy &s;ound health and long life: Per&s;ons, born
to power and authority, be framed with good
tempers and virtuous di&s;po&s;itions. A few &s;uch
events as the&s;e, regularly and wi&s;ely conducted,
would change the face of the world; and yet
would no more &s;eem to di&s;turb the cour&s;e of Na|ture
or confound human conduct, than the pre|&s;ent
oeconomy of things, where the cau&s;es are &s;e|cret,
and variable, and compounded. Some
&s;mall touches, given to CALIGULA's brain in his
infancy, might have converted him into a TRA|JAN:
one wave, a little higher than the re&s;t, by
burying CAESAR and his fortune in the bottom of
the ocean, might have re&s;tored liberty to a con&s;i|derable
part of mankind. There may, for aught
we know, be good rea&s;ons, why Providence in|terpo&s;es
not in this manner; but they are un|known
to us: and though the mere &s;uppo&s;ition,
that &s;uch rea&s;ons exi&s;t, may be &s;ufficient to <HI>&s;ave</HI>
the conclu&s;ion concerning the divine attributes,
yet &s;urely it can never be &s;ufficient to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI>
that conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>If every thing in the univer&s;e be conducted by
general laws, and if animals be rendered &s;u&s;cep|tible
of pain, it &s;carcely &s;eems po&s;&s;ible but &s;ome ill
mu&s;t ari&s;e in the various &s;hocks of matter, and
the various concurrence and oppo&s;ition of general
laws: But this ill would be very rare, were it not
for the <HI>third</HI> circum&s;tance, which I propo&s;ed to
mention, <HI>viz.</HI> the great frugality, with which all
powers and faculties are di&s;tributed to every par|ticular
<PB N="120" REF="122">
being. So well adju&s;ted are the organs
and capacities of all animals, and &s;o well fitted to
their pre&s;ervation, that, as far as hi&s;tory or tradi|tion
reaches, there appears not to be any &s;ingle
&s;pecies, which has yet been extingui&s;hed in the u|niver&s;e.
Every animal has the requi&s;ite endow|ments;
but the&s;e endowments are be&s;towed with
&s;o &s;crupulous an oeconomy, that any con&s;i|derable
diminution mu&s;t entirely de&s;troy the crea|ture.
Where-ever one power is encrea&s;ed, there
is a proportional abatement in the others. Ani|mals,
which excel in &s;wiftne&s;s, are commonly de|fective
in force. Tho&s;e, which po&s;&s;e&s;s both, are
either imperfect in &s;ome of their &s;en&s;es, or are
oppre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t craving wants. The hu|man
&s;pecies, who&s;e chief excellency is rea&s;on and
fagacity, is of all others the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous, and
the mo&s;t deficient in bodily advantages; without
cloaths, without arms, without food, without
lodging, without any convenience of life, except
what they owe to their own &s;kill and indu&s;try. In
&s;hort, Nature &s;eems to have formed an exact cal|culation
of the nece&s;&s;ities of her creatures; and
like a <HI>rigid ma&s;ter,</HI> has afforded them little more
powers or endowments, than what are &s;trictly &s;uf|ficient
to &s;upply tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities. An <HI>indulgent
parent</HI> would have be&s;towed a large &s;tock, in or|der
to guard again&s;t accidents, and &s;ecure the
happine&s;s and welfare of the creature, in the mo&s;t
unfortunate concurrence of circum&s;tances. Every
cour&s;e of life would not have been &s;o &s;urrounded
<PB N="121" REF="123">
with precipices, that the lea&s;t departure from the
true path, by mi&s;take or nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t involve
us in mi&s;ery and ruin. Some re&s;erve, &s;ome fund
would have been provided to en&s;ure happine&s;s;
nor would the powers and the nece&s;&s;ities have
been adju&s;ted with &s;o rigid an oeconomy. The au|thor
of Nature is inconceivably powerful: his
force is &s;uppo&s;ed great, if not altogether inexhau&s;t|ible:
nor is there any rea&s;on, as far as we can
judge, to make him ob&s;erve this &s;trict frugality
in his dealings with his creatures. It would have
been better, were his power extremely limited, to
have created fewer animals, and to have endowed
the&s;e with more faculties for their happine&s;s and
pre&s;ervation. A builder is never e&s;teemed pru|dent,
who undertakes a plan, beyond what his
&s;tock will enable him to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>In order to cure mo&s;t of the ills of human life,
I require not that man &s;hould have the wings of
the eagle, the &s;wiftne&s;s of the &s;tag, the force of
the ox, the arms of the lion, the &s;cales of the
crocodile or rhinoceros; much lefs do I demand
the &s;agacity of an angel or cherubim. I am con|tented
to take an encrea&s;e in one &s;ingle power or
faculty of his &s;oul. Let him be endowed with a
greater propen&s;ity to indu&s;try and labour; a more
vigorous &s;pring and activity of mind; a more con|&s;tant
bent to bu&s;ine&s;s and application. Let the
whole &s;pecies po&s;&s;e&s;s naturally an equal diligence
with that which many individuals are able to at|tain
by habit and reflection; and the mo&s;t bene|ficial
<PB N="122" REF="124">
con&s;equences, without any allay of ill, is the
immediate and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of this endowment.
Almo&s;t all the moral, as well as natural evils of
human life ari&s;e from idlene&s;s; and were our &s;pe|cies,
by the original con&s;titution of their frame,
exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect
cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and
manufactures, the exact execution of every office
and duty, immediately follow; and men at once
may fully reach that &s;tate of &s;ociety, which is &s;o
imperfectly attained by the be&s;t-regulated govern|ment.
But as indu&s;try is a power, and the mo&s;t
valuable of any, Nature &s;eems determined, &s;uit|ably
to her u&s;ual maxims, to be&s;tow it on men
with a very &s;paring hand; and rather to puni&s;h
him &s;everely for his deficiency in it, than to re|ward
him for his attainments. She has &s;o con|trived
his frame, that nothing but the mo&s;t vio|lent
nece&s;&s;ity can oblige him to labour; and &s;he
employs all his other wants to overcome, at lea&s;t
in part, the want of diligence, and to endow him
with &s;ome &s;hare of a faculty, of which &s;he has
thought fit naturally to bereave him. Here our
demands may be allowed very humble, and there|fore
the more rea&s;onable. If we required the en|dowments
of &s;uperior penetration and judgement,
of a more delicate ta&s;te of beauty, of a nicer
&s;en&s;ibility to benevolence and friend&s;hip; we
might be told, that we impiou&s;ly pretend to break
the order of Nature, that we want to exalt our|&s;elves
into a higher rank of being, that the pre|&s;ents
<PB N="123" REF="125">
which we require, not being &s;uitable to our
&s;tate and condition, would only be pernicious to
us. But it is hard; I dare to repeat it, it is hard,
that being placed in a world &s;o full of wants and
nece&s;&s;ities; where almo&s;t every being and element
is either our foe or refu&s;es its a&s;&s;i&s;tance &mdash; we
&s;hould al&s;o have our own temper to &s;truggle with,
and &s;hould be deprived of that faculty, which can
alone fence again&s;t the&s;e multiplied evils.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> circum&s;tance, whence ari&s;es the
mi&s;ery and ill of the univer&s;e, is the inaccurate
workman&s;hip of all the &s;prings and principles of
the great machine of nature. It mu&s;t be acknow|ledged,
that there are few parts of the uni|ver&s;e,
which &s;eem not to &s;erve &s;ome purpo&s;e, and
who&s;e removal would not produce a vi&s;ible defect
and di&s;order in the whole. The parts hang all to|gether;
nor can one be touched without affecting
the re&s;t, in a greater or le&s;s degree. But at the
&s;ame time, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that none of
the&s;e parts or principles, however u&s;eful, are &s;o
accurately adju&s;ted, as to keep preci&s;ely within
tho&s;e bounds, in which their utility con&s;i&s;ts; but
they are, all of them, apt, on every occa&s;ion, to
run into the one extreme or the other. One
would imagine, that this grand production had
not received the la&s;t hand of the maker; &s;o little
fini&s;hed is every part, and &s;o coar&s;e are the
&s;trokes, with which it is executed. Thus, the
winds are requi&s;ite to convey the vapours along
the &s;urface of the globe, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t men in na|vigation:
<PB N="124" REF="126">
but how oft, ri&s;ing up to tempe&s;ts and
hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains
are nece&s;&s;ary to nouri&s;h all the plants and animals
of the earth: but how often are they defective?
how often exce&s;&s;ive? Heat is requi&s;ite to all life
and vegetation; but is not always found in the
due proportion. On the mixture and &s;ecretion
of the humours and juices of the body depend the
health and pro&s;perity of the animal: but the parts
perform not regularly their proper function. What
more u&s;eful than all the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, am|bition,
vanity, love, anger? But how oft do
they break their bounds, and cau&s;e the greate&s;t
convul&s;ions in &s;ociety? There is nothing &s;o ad|vantageous
in the univer&s;e, but what frequently
becomes pernicious, by its exce&s;s or defect; nor
has Nature guarded, with the requi&s;ite accuracy,
again&s;t all di&s;order or confu&s;ion. The irregulari|ty
is never, perhaps, &s;o great as to de&s;troy any
&s;pecies; but is often &s;ufficient to involve the indi|viduals
in ruin and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>On the concurrence, then, of the&s;e <HI>four</HI> cir|cum&s;tances
does all, or the greate&s;t part of natu|ral
evil depend. Were all living creatures inca|pable
of pain, or were the world admini&s;tered by
particular volitions, evil never could have found
acce&s;s into the univer&s;e: and were animals en|dowed
with a large &s;tock of powers and faculties,
beyond what &s;trict nece&s;&s;ity requires; or were the
&s;everal &s;prings and principles of the univer&s;e &s;o
accurately framed as to pre&s;erve always the ju&s;t
<PB N="125" REF="127">
temperament and medium; there mu&s;t have been
very little ill in compari&s;on of what we feel at pre|&s;ent.
What then &s;hall we pronounce on this oc|ca&s;ion?
Shall we &s;ay, that the&s;e circum&s;tances
are not nece&s;&s;ary, and that they might ea&s;ily have
been altered in the contrivance of the univer&s;e?
This deci&s;ion &s;eems too pre&s;umptuous for crea|tures,
&s;o blind and ignorant. Let us be more
mode&s;t in our conclu&s;ions. Let us allow, that, if
the goodne&s;s of the Deity (I mean a goodne&s;s like
the human) could be e&s;tabli&s;hed on any tolerable
rea&s;ons <HI>a priori,</HI> the&s;e phenomena, however un|toward,
would not be &s;ufficient to &s;ubvert that
principle; but might ea&s;ily, in &s;ome unknown
manner, be reconcilable to it. But let us &s;till a&s;|&s;ert,
that as this goodne&s;s is not antecedently e|&s;tabli&s;hed,
but mu&s;t be inferred from the pheno|mena,
there can be no grounds for &s;uch an infer|ence,
while there are &s;o many ills in the univer&s;e,
and while the&s;e ills might &s;o ea&s;ily have been re|medied,
as far as human under&s;tanding can be
allowed to judge on &s;uch a &s;ubject. I am Sceptic
enough to allow, that the bad appearances, not|with&s;tanding
all my rea&s;onings, may be compati|ble
with &s;uch attributes as you &s;uppo&s;e: But &s;ure|ly
they can never prove the&s;e attributes. Such a
conclu&s;ion cannot re&s;ult from Sceptici&s;m; but
mu&s;t ari&s;e from the phenomena, and from our
confidence in the rea&s;onings, which we deduce
from the&s;e phenomena.</P>
<P>Look round this univer&s;e. What an immen&s;e
<PB N="126" REF="128">
profu&s;ion of beings, animated and organized,
fen&s;ible and active! You admire this prodigious
variety and fecundity. But in&s;pect a little more
narrowly the&s;e living exi&s;tences, the only beings
worth regarding. How ho&s;tile and de&s;tructive to
each other! How in&s;ufficient all of them for
their own happine&s;s! How contemptible or o|dious
to the &s;pectator! The whole pre&s;ents no|thing
but the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated
by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth
from her lap, without di&s;cernment or parental
care, her maimed and abortive children.</P>
<P>Here the MANICHAEAN &s;y&s;tem occurs as a pro|per
hypothe&s;is to &s;olve the difficulty: and no
doubt, in &s;ome re&s;pects, it is very &s;pecious, and
has more probability than the common hypothe&s;is,
by giving a plau&s;ible account of the &s;trange mix|ture
of good and ill, which appears in life. But
if we con&s;ider, on the other hand, the perfect
uniformity and agreement of the parts of the u|niver&s;e,
we &s;hall not di&s;cover in it any marks of
the combat of a malevolent with a benevolent be|ing.
There is indeed an oppo&s;ition of pains and
plea&s;ures in the feelings of &s;en&s;ible creatures: but
are not all the operations of Nature carried on by
an oppo&s;ition of principles, of hot and cold, moi&s;t
and dry, light and heavy? The true conclu&s;ion
is, that the original &s;ource of all things is entirely
indifferent to all the&s;e principles, and has no more
regard to good above ill than to heat above cold,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
or to drought above moi&s;ture, or to light above
heavy.</P>
<P>There may <HI>four</HI> hypothe&s;es be framed concern|ing
the fir&s;t cau&s;es of the univer&s;e; <HI>that</HI> they are
endowed with perfect goodne&s;s, <HI>that</HI> they have
perfect malice, <HI>that</HI> they are oppo&s;ite and have
both goodne&s;s and malice, <HI>that</HI> they have neither
goodne&s;s nor malice. Mixt phenomena can ne|ver
prove the two former unmixt principles,
And the uniformity and &s;teadine&s;s of general
laws &s;eems to oppo&s;e the third. The fourth, there|fore,
&s;eems by far the mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid concerning natural evil will
apply to moral, with little or no variation; and
we have no more rea&s;on to infer, that the recti|tude
of the &s;upreme Being re&s;embles human rec|titude
than that his benevolence re&s;embles the hu|man.
Nay, it will be thought, that we have &s;till
greater cau&s;e to exclude from him moral &s;enti|ments,
&s;uch as we feel them; &s;ince moral evil,
in the opinion of many, is much more predomi|nant
above moral good than natural evil above na|tural
good.</P>
<P>But even though this &s;hould not be allowed,
and though the virtue, which is in mankind,
&s;hould be acknowledged much &s;uperior to the
vice; yet &s;o long as there is any vice at all in
the univer&s;e, it will very much puzzle you An|thropomorphites,
how to account for it. You
mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for it, without having recour&s;e
to the fir&s;t cau&s;e. But as every effect mu&s;t have
<PB N="128" REF="130">
a cau&s;e, and that cau&s;e another; you mu&s;t either
carry on the progre&s;&s;ion <HI>in infinitum,</HI> or re&s;t on
that original principle, who is the ultimate cau&s;e
of all things &mdash;</P>
<P>Hold! Hold! cried DEMEA: Whither does
your imagination hurry you? I joined in alliance
with you, in order to prove the incomprehen&s;ible
nature of the divine Being, and refute the prin|ciples
of CLEANTHES, who would mea&s;ure e|very
thing by a human rule and &s;tandard. But
I now find you running into all the topics of the
greate&s;t libertines and infidels; and betraying
that holy cau&s;e, which you &s;eemingly e&s;pou&s;ed.
Are you &s;ecretly, then, a more dangerous enemy
than CLEANTHES him&s;elf?</P>
<P>And are you &s;o late in perceiving it? replied CLE|ANTHES.
Believe me, DEMEA; your friend PHI|LO,
from the beginning, has been amu&s;ing him|&s;elf
at both our expence; and it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that the injudicious rea&s;oning of our vul|gar
theology has given him but too ju&s;t a handle
of ridicule. The total infirmity of human rea&s;on,
the ab&s;olute incomprehen&s;ibility of the Divine
Nature, the great and univer&s;al mi&s;ery and &s;till
greater wickedne&s;s of men; the&s;e are &s;trange to|pics
&s;urely to be &s;o fondly cheri&s;hed by orthodox
divines and doctors. In ages of &s;tupidity and
ignorance, indeed, the&s;e principles may &s;afely
be e&s;pou&s;ed; and perhaps, no views of things
are more proper to promote &s;uper&s;tition, than
&s;uch as encourage the blind amazement, the dif|fidence,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
and melancholy of mankind. But at
pre&s;ent. &mdash;</P>
<P>Blame not &s;o much, interpo&s;ed PHILO, the
ignorance of the&s;e reverend gentlemen. They
know how to change their &s;tyle with the times.
Formerly it was a mo&s;t popular theological topic
to maintain, that human life was vanity and mi|&s;ery,
and to exaggerate all the ills and pains,
which are incident to men. But of late years,
divines, we find, begin to retract this po&s;ition,
and maintain, though &s;till with &s;ome he&s;itation,
that there are more goods than evils, more plea|&s;ures
than pains, even in this life. When reli|gion
&s;tood entirely upon temper and education,
it was thought proper to encourage melancholy;
as indeed, mankind never have recour&s;e to &s;upe|rior
powers &s;o readily as in that di&s;po&s;ition. But
as men have now learned to form principles, and
to draw con&s;equences, it is nece&s;&s;ary to change
the batteries, and to make u&s;e of &s;uch arguments
as will endure, at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;crutiny and exami|nation.
This variation is the &s;ame (and from
the &s;ame cau&s;es) with that which I formerly re|marked
with regard to Sceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>Thus PHILO continued to the la&s;t his &s;pirit of
oppo&s;ition, and his cen&s;ure of e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions.
But I could ob&s;erve, that DEMEA did not at all
reli&s;h the latter part of the di&s;cour&s;e; and he
took occa&s;ion &s;oon after, on &s;ome pretence or
other, to leave the company.</P>

<P>After DEMEA's departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part XII.</NOTE> CLEANTHES
and PHILO continued the conver&s;ation in the fol|lowing
manner. Our friend, I am afraid, &s;aid
CLEANTHES, will have little inclination to re|vive
this topic of di&s;cour&s;e, while you are in com|pany;
and to tell truth, PHILO, I &s;hould rather
wi&s;h to rea&s;on with either of you apart on a &s;ub|ject,
&s;o &s;ublime and intere&s;ting. Your &s;pirit of
controver&s;y, joined to your abhorrence of vulgar
&s;uper&s;tition, carries you &s;trange lengths, when
engaged in an argument; and there is nothing
&s;o &s;acred and venerable, even in your own eyes,
which you &s;pare on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, replied PHILO, that I am le&s;s
cautious on the &s;ubject of Natural Religion than
on any other; both becau&s;e I know that I can
never, on that head, corrupt the principles of
any man of common &s;en&s;e, and becau&s;e no one,
I am confident, in who&s;e eyes I appear a man of
common &s;en&s;e, will ever mi&s;take my intentions.
You in particular, CLEANTHES, with whom I
live in unre&s;erved intimacy; you are &s;en&s;ible,
that, notwith&s;tanding the freedom of my conver|&s;ation,
and my love of &s;ingular arguments, no
one has a deeper &s;en&s;e of religion impre&s;&s;ed on
his mind, or pays more profound adoration to
the divine Being, as he di&s;covers him&s;elf to rea|&s;on,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice
of Nature. A purpo&s;e, an intention, a de&s;ign
&s;trikes every where the mo&s;t carele&s;s, the mo&s;t
&s;tupid thinker; and no man can be &s;o hardened
in ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tems, as at all times to reject it.
<HI>That Nature does nothing in vain,</HI> is a maxim
e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the &s;chools, merely from the
contemplation of the works of Nature, without
any religious purpo&s;e; and, from a firm convic|tion
of its truth, an anatomi&s;t, who had ob&s;erved
a new organ or canal, would never be &s;atisfied,
till he had al&s;o di&s;covered its u&s;e and intention.
One great foundation of the COPERNICAN &s;y|&s;tem
is the maxim, <HI>That Nature acts by the
&s;imple&s;t methods, and chu&s;es the mo&s;t proper
means to any end;</HI> and a&s;tronomers often, with|out
thinking of it, lay this &s;trong foundation of
piety and religion. The &s;ame thing is ob&s;ervable
in other parts of philo&s;ophy: And thus all the
&s;ciences almo&s;t lead us in&s;en&s;ibly to acknowledge
a fir&s;t intelligent Author; and their authority is
often &s;o much the greater, as they do not di|rectly
profe&s;s that intention.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ure I hear GALEN rea&s;on con|cerning
the &s;tructure of the human body. The
anatomy of a man, &s;ays he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De formatione foetus.</NOTE>, di&s;covers above
600 different mu&s;cles; and whoever duly con|&s;iders
the&s;e, will find, that in each of them Na|ture
mu&s;t have adju&s;ted at lea&s;t ten different cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
in order to attain the end which &s;he
propo&s;ed; proper figure, ju&s;t magnitude, right
di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal ends, upper and lower
po&s;ition of the whole, the due in&s;ertion of the
&s;everal nerves, veins, and arteries: So that in
the mu&s;cles alone, above 6000 &s;everal views and
intentions mu&s;t have been formed and executed.
The bones he calculates to be 284: The di&s;tinct
purpo&s;es, aimed at in the &s;tructure of each, a|bove
forty. What a prodigious di&s;play of arti|fice,
even in the&s;e &s;imple and homogeneous
parts? But if we con&s;ider the &s;kin, ligaments,
ve&s;&s;els, glandules, humours, the &s;everal limbs
and members of the body; how mu&s;t our a&s;to|ni&s;hment
ri&s;e upon us, in proportion to the num|ber
and intricacy of the parts &s;o artificially ad|ju&s;ted?
The farther we advance in the&s;e re|&s;earches,
we di&s;cover new &s;cenes of art and wi&s;|dom:
But de&s;cry &s;till, at a di&s;tance, farther
&s;cenes beyond our reach; in the fine internal
&s;tructure of the parts, in the oeconomy of the
brain, in the fabric of the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els. All
the&s;e artifices are repeated in every different &s;pe|cies
of animal, with wonderful variety, and with
exact propriety, &s;uited to the different intentions
of Nature, in framing each &s;pecies. And if the
infidelity of GALEN, even when the&s;e natural
&s;ciences were &s;till imperfect, could not with|&s;tand
&s;uch &s;triking appearances; to what pitch
of pertinacious ob&s;tinacy mu&s;t a philo&s;opher in
<PB N="133" REF="135">
this age have attained, who can now doubt of a
Supreme Intelligence?</P>
<P>Could I meet with one of this &s;pecies (who, I
thank God, are very rare) I would a&s;k him:
Suppo&s;ing there were a God, who did not di&s;|cover
him&s;elf immediately to our &s;en&s;es; were
it po&s;&s;ible for him to give &s;tronger proofs of his
exi&s;tence, than what appear on the whole face
of Nature? What indeed could &s;uch a divine
Being do, but copy the pre&s;ent oeconomy of
things; render many of his artifices &s;o plain,
that no &s;tupidity could mi&s;take them; afford
glimp&s;es of &s;till greater artifices, which demon|&s;trate
his prodigious &s;uperiority above our nar|row
apprehen&s;ions; and conceal altogether a great
many from &s;uch imperfect creatures? Now ac|cording
to all rules of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, every fact
mu&s;t pa&s;s for undi&s;puted, when it is &s;upported by
all the arguments, which its nature admits of;
even though the&s;e arguments be not, in them|&s;elves,
very numerous or forcible: How much
more, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where no human ima|gination
can compute their number, and no un|der&s;tanding
e&s;timate their cogency?</P>
<P>I &s;hall farther add, &s;aid CLEANTHES, to what
you have &s;o well urged, that one great advantage of
the principle of Thei&s;m, is, that it is the only &s;y&s;tem
of co&s;mogony, which can be rendered intelligible
and complete, and yet can throughout pre&s;erve a
&s;trong analogy to what we every day &s;ee and ex|perience
in the world. The compari&s;on of the
<PB N="134" REF="136">
univer&s;e to a machine of human contrivance is &s;o
obvious and natural, and is ju&s;tified by &s;o many
in&s;tances of order and de&s;ign in Nature, that it
mu&s;t immediately &s;trike all unprejudiced appre|hen&s;ions,
and procure univer&s;al approbation.
Whoever attempts to weaken this theory, can|not
pretend to &s;ucceed by e&s;tabli&s;hing in its place
any other, that is preci&s;e and determinate: It is
&s;ufficient for him, if he &s;tart doubts and difficul|ties;
and by remote and ab&s;tract views of things,
reach that &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgement, which is here
the utmo&s;t boundary of his wi&s;hes. But be&s;ides,
that this &s;tate of mind is in it&s;elf un&s;atisfactory,
it can never be &s;teadily maintained again&s;t &s;uch
&s;triking appearances, as continually engage us
into the religious hypothe&s;is. A fal&s;e, ab&s;urd &s;y|&s;tem,
human nature, from the force of prejudice,
is capable of adhering to, with ob&s;tinacy and per|&s;everance:
But no &s;y&s;tem at all, in oppo&s;ition to
a theory, &s;upported by &s;trong and obvious rea|&s;on,
by natural propen&s;ity, and by early educa|tion,
I think it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to maintain
or defend.</P>
<P>So little, replied PHILO, do I e&s;teem this &s;u&s;|pen&s;e
of judgement in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to be po&s;|&s;ible,
that I am apt to &s;u&s;pect there enters &s;ome|what
of a di&s;pute of words into this controver&s;y,
more than is u&s;ually imagined. That the works
of Nature bear a great analogy to the productions
of art is evident; and according to all the rules
of good rea&s;oning, we ought to infer, if we ar|gue
<PB N="135" REF="137">
at all concerning them, that their cau&s;es have
a proportional analogy. But as there are al&s;o
con&s;iderable differences, we have rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e
a proportional difference in the cau&s;es; and
in particular ought to attribute a much higher
degree of power and energy to the &s;upreme cau&s;e
than any we have ever ob&s;erved in mankind.
Here then the exi&s;tence of a DEITY is plainly
a&s;certained by rea&s;on; and if we make it a que|&s;tion,
whether, on account of the&s;e analogies,
we can properly call him a <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>intelligence,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t difference, which may
rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed between him and human
minds; what is this but a mere verbal controver|&s;y?
No man can deny the analogies between
the effects: To re&s;train our&s;elves from enquiring
concerning the cau&s;es is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible: From
this enquiry, the legitimate conclu&s;ion is, that
the cau&s;es have al&s;o an analogy: And if we are
not contented with calling the fir&s;t and &s;upreme
cau&s;e a GOD or DEITY, but de&s;ire to vary
the expr&egrave;&s;&s;ion; what can we call him but MIND
or THOUGHT, to which he is ju&s;tly &s;uppo|&s;ed
to bear a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance?</P>
<P>All men of &s;ound rea&s;on are di&s;gu&s;ted with
verbal di&s;putes, which abound &s;o much in philo|&s;ophical
and theological enquiries; and it is found,
that the only remedy for this abu&s;e mu&s;t ari&s;e
from clear definitions, from the preci&s;ion of tho&s;e
ideas which enter into any argument, and from
the &s;trict and uniform u&s;e of tho&s;e terms which
<PB N="136" REF="138">
are employed. But there is a &s;pecies of contro|ver&s;y,
which, from the very nature of language
and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual am|biguity,
and can never, by any precaution or
any definitions, be able to reach a rea&s;onable
certainty or preci&s;ion. The&s;e are the controver|&s;ies
concerning the degrees of any quality or cir|cum&s;tance.
Men may argue to all eternity, whe|ther
HANNIBAL be a great, or a very great, or a
&s;uperlatively great man, what degree of beauty
CLEOPATRA po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, what epithet of prai&s;e LI|VY
or THUCIDYDES is intitled to, without bring|ing
the controver&s;y to any determination. The di&s;|putants
may here agree in their &s;en&s;e, and differ in
the terms, or <HI>vice ver&s;a;</HI> yet never be able to
define their terms, &s;o as to enter into each others
meaning: Becau&s;e the degrees of the&s;e qualities
are not, like quantity or number, &s;u&s;ceptible of
any exact men&s;uration, which may be the &s;tand|ard
in the controver&s;y. That the di&s;pute con|cerning
Thei&s;m is of this nature, and con&s;equent|ly
is merely verbal, or perhaps, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till
more incurably ambiguous, will appear upon the
&s;lighte&s;t enquiry. I a&s;k the Thei&s;t, if he does
not allow, that there is a great and immea&s;urable,
becau&s;e incomprehen&s;ible, difference between the
<HI>human</HI> and the <HI>divine</HI> mind: The more pious
he is, the more readily will he a&s;&s;ent to the affir|mative,
and the more will he be di&s;po&s;ed to mag|nify
the difference: He will even a&s;&s;ert, that the
difference is of a nature which cannot be too
<PB N="137" REF="139">
much magnified. I next turn to the Athei&s;t,
who, I a&s;&s;ert, is only nominally &s;o, and can ne|ver
po&s;&s;ibly be in earne&s;t; and I a&s;k him, whe|ther,
from the coherence and apparent &s;ympathy
in all the parts of this world, there be not a cer|tain
degree of analogy among all the operations
of Nature, in every &s;ituation and in every age;
whether the rotting of a turnip, the generation of
an animal, and the &s;tructure of human thought
be not energies that probably bear &s;ome remote
analogy to each other: It is impo&s;&s;ible he can
deny it: He will readily acknowledge it. Ha|ving
obtained this conce&s;&s;ion, I pu&s;h him &s;till
farther in his retreat; and I a&s;k him, if it be not
probable, that the principle which fir&s;t arranged,
and &s;till maintains order in this univer&s;e, bears
not al&s;o &s;ome remote inconceivable analogy to
the other operations of Nature, and among
the re&s;t to the oeconomy of human mind and
thought. However reluctant, he mu&s;t give his
a&s;&s;ent. Where then, cry I to both the&s;e anta|goni&s;ts,
is the &s;ubject of your di&s;pute? The Thei&s;t
allows, that the original intelligence is very dif|ferent
from human rea&s;on: The Athei&s;t allows,
that the original principle of order bears &s;ome
remote analogy to it. Will you quarrel, Gen|tlemen,
about the degrees, and enter into a con|trover&s;y,
which admits not of any preci&s;e mean|ing,
nor con&s;equently of any determination? If
you &s;hould be &s;o ob&s;tinate, I &s;hould not to be
&s;urpri&s;ed to find you in&s;en&s;ibly change &s;ides;
<PB N="138" REF="140">
while the Thei&s;t on the one hand exaggerates the
di&s;&s;imilarity between the Supreme Being, and
frail, imperfect, variable, fleeting, and mortal
creatures; and the Athei&s;t on the other magni|fies
the analogy among all the operations of
Nature, in every period, every &s;ituation, and e|very
po&s;ition. Con&s;ider then, where the real
point of controver&s;y lies, and if you cannot lay a|&s;ide
your di&s;putes, endeavour, at lea&s;t, to cure
your&s;elves of your animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge, CLEAN|THES,
that, as the works of Nature have a much
greater analogy to the effects of <HI>our</HI> art and con|trivance,
than to tho&s;e of <HI>our</HI> benevolence and
ju&s;tice; we have rea&s;on to infer that the natural
attributes of the Deity have a greater re&s;emblance
to tho&s;e of man, than his moral have to human
virtues. But what is the con&s;equence? Nothing
but this, that the moral qualities of man are
more defective in their kind than his natural
abilities. For as the Supreme Being is allowed
to be ab&s;olutely and entirely perfect, whatever
differs mo&s;t from him departs the farthe&s;t from
the &s;upreme &s;tandard of rectitude and perfec|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems evident, that the di&s;pute between the Sceptics and Dogmati&s;ts is entirely verbal, or at lea&s;t regards only the degrees of doubt and a&s;&s;urance, which we ought to indulge with regard to all rea&s;oning: And &s;uch di&s;putes are commonly, at the bottom, verbal, and admit not of any preci&s;e determination. No phi|lo&s;ophical Dogmati&s;t denies, that there are difficulties both with regard to the &s;en&s;es and to all &s;cience; and that the&s;e difficulties are in a regular, logical method, ab&s;olutely in&s;olveable. No Sceptic denies, that we lie under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e dif|ficulties, of thinking, and believing, and rea&s;oning with regard to all kind of &s;ubjects, and even of frequently a&s;&s;enting with confidence and &s;ecurity. The only differ|ence, then, between the&s;e &s;ects, if they merit that name, is, that the Sceptic, from habit, caprice, or in|clination, in&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t on the difficulties; the Dogmati&s;t, for like rea&s;ons, on the nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">
The&s;e, CLEANTHES, are my unfeigned &s;enti|ments
on this &s;ubject; and the&s;e &s;entiments, you
know, I have ever cheri&s;hed and maintained.
But in proportion to my veneration for true re|ligion,
is my abhorrence of vulgar &s;uper&s;titions;
and I indulge a peculiar plea&s;ure, I confe&s;s, in
pu&s;hing &s;uch principles, &s;ometimes into ab&s;urdity,
&s;ometimes into impiety. And you are &s;en&s;ible,
that all bigots, notwith&s;tanding their great aver|&s;ion
to the latter above the former, are common|ly
equally guilty of both.</P>
<P>My inclination, replied CLEANTHES, lies, I
own, a contrary way. Religion, however cor|rupted,
is &s;till better than no religion at all. The
doctrine of a future &s;tate is &s;o &s;trong and nece&s;|&s;ary
a &s;ecurity to morals, that we never ought to
abandon or neglect it. For if finite and tempo|rary
<PB N="140" REF="142">
rewards and puni&s;hments have &s;o great an
effect, as we daily find; how much greater mu&s;t
be expected from &s;uch as are infinite and eter|nal?</P>
<P>How happens it then, &s;aid PHILO, if vulgar
&s;uper&s;tition be &s;o &s;alutary to &s;ociety, that all hi|&s;tory
abounds &s;o much with accounts of its per|nicious
con&s;equences on public a&s;&s;airs? Factions,
civil wars, per&s;ecutions, &s;ubver&s;ions of govern|ment,
oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;lavery; the&s;e are the di&s;mal
con&s;equences which always attend its prevalency
over the minds of men. If the religious &s;pirit
be ever mentioned in any hi&s;torical narration, we
are &s;ure to meet afterwards with a detail of the
mi&s;eries, which attend it. And no period of time
can be happier or more pro&s;perous, than tho&s;e
in which it is never regarded, or heard of.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this ob&s;ervation, replied CLE|ANTHES,
is obvious. The proper office of re|ligion
is to regulate the heart of men, humanize
their conduct, infu&s;e the &s;pirit of temperance,
order, and obedience; and as its operation is
&s;ilent, and only enforces the motives of morality
and ju&s;tice, it is in danger of being overlooked,
and confounded with the&s;e other motives. When
it di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf, and acts as a &s;eparate prin|ciple
over men, it has departed from its proper
&s;phere, and has become only a cover to faction
and ambition.</P>
<P>And &s;o will all religion, &s;aid PHILO, except
the philo&s;ophical and rational kind. Your rea|&s;onings
<PB N="141" REF="143">
are more ea&s;ily eluded than my facts.
The inference is not ju&s;t, becau&s;e finite and tempo|rary
rewards and puni&s;hments have &s;o great in|fluence,
that therefore &s;uch as are infinite and e|ternal
mu&s;t have &s;o much greater. Con&s;ider, I
be&s;eech you, the attachment, which we have to
pre&s;ent things, and the little concern which we di&s;|cover
for objects, &s;o remote and uncertain. When
divines are declaiming again&s;t the common beha|viour
and conduct of the world, they always re|pre&s;ent
this principle as the &s;tronge&s;t imaginable
(which indeed it is) and de&s;cribe almo&s;t all hu|man
kind as lying under the influence of it, and
&s;unk into the deepe&s;t lethargy and unconcern a|bout
their religious intere&s;ts. Yet the&s;e &s;ame di|vines,
when they refute their &s;peculative antago|ni&s;ts,
&s;uppo&s;e the motives of religion to be &s;o
powerful, that, without them, it were impo&s;&s;ible
for civil &s;ociety to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; nor are they a&s;hamed
of &s;o palpable a contradiction. It is certain, from
experience, that the &s;malle&s;t grain of natural ho|ne&s;ty
and benevolence has more effect on mens
conduct, than the mo&s;t pompous views, &s;ugge&s;ted
by theological theories and &s;y&s;tems. A man's na|tural
inclination works ince&s;&s;antly upon him; it is
for ever pre&s;ent to the mind; and mingles it&s;elf
with every view and con&s;ideration: whereas reli|gious
motives, where they act at all, operate on|ly
by &s;tarts and bounds; and it is &s;carcely po&s;|&s;ible
for them to become altogether habitual to
the mind. The force of the greate&s;t gravity, &s;ay
the philo&s;ephers, is infinitely &s;mall, in compari&s;on
<PB N="142" REF="144">
of that of the lea&s;t impul&s;e; yet it is certain, that
the &s;malle&s;t gravity will, in the end, prevail above
a great impul&s;e; becau&s;e no &s;trokes or blows can
be repeated with &s;uch con&s;tancy as attraction and
gravitation.</P>
<P>Another advantage of inclination: It engages
on its &s;ide all the wit and ingenuity of the mind;
and when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to religious principles,
&s;eeks every method and art of eluding them:
In which it is almo&s;t always &s;ucce&s;sful. Who
can explain the heart of man, or account for
tho&s;e &s;trange &s;alvos and excu&s;es, with which
people &s;atisfy them&s;elves, when they follow their
inclinations, in oppo&s;ition to their religious duty?
This is well under&s;tood in the world; and none
but fools ever repo&s;e le&s;s tru&s;t in a man, becau&s;e
they hear, that, from &s;tudy and philo&s;ophy, he
has entertained &s;ome &s;peculative doubts with re|gard
to theological &s;ubjects. And when we have
to do with a man, who makes a great profe&s;&s;ion
of religion and devotion; has this any other ef|fect
upon &s;everal, who pa&s;s for prudent, than to
put them on their guard, le&s;t they be cheated
and deceived by him?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t farther con&s;ider, that philo&s;ophers,
who cultivate rea&s;on and reflection, &s;tand le&s;s in
need of &s;uch motives to keep them under the re|&s;traint
of morals: and that the vulgar, who alone
may need them, are utterly incapable of &s;o pure
a religion, as repre&s;ents the Deity to be plea|&s;ed
with nothing but virtue in human behaviour.
The recommendations to the Divinity are general|ly
<PB N="143" REF="145">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be either frivolous ob&s;ervances, or
rapturous ec&s;ta&s;ies, or a bigotted credulity. We
need not run back into antiquity, or wander into
remote regions, to find in&s;tances of this degene|racy.
Among&s;t our&s;elves, &s;ome have been guilty
of that atrociou&s;ne&s;s, unknown to the EGYPTIAN
and GRECIAN &s;uper&s;titions, of declaiming, in ex|pre&s;s
terms, again&s;t morality, and repre&s;enting it
as a &s;ure forfeiture of the divine favour, if the
lea&s;t tru&s;t or reliance be laid upon it.</P>
<P>But even though &s;uper&s;tition or enthu&s;ia&s;m
&s;hould not put it&s;elf in direct oppo&s;ition to mora|lity;
the very diverting of the attention, the rai|&s;ing
up a new and frivolous &s;pecies of merit, the
prepo&s;terous di&s;tribution, which it makes of prai&s;e
and blame; mu&s;t have the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;e|quences,
and weaken extremely mens attach|ment
to the natural motives of ju&s;tice and huma|nity.</P>
<P>Such a principle of action likewi&s;e, not being
any of the familiar motives of human conduct,
acts only by intervals on the temper, and mu&s;t be
rouzed by continual efforts, in order to render
the pious zealot &s;atisfied with his own conduct,
and make him fulfil his devotional ta&s;k. Many
religious exerci&s;es are entered into with &s;eeming
fervour, where the heart, at the time, feels cold
and languid: A habit of di&s;&s;imulation is by de|grees
contracted: and fraud and fal&s;ehood be|come
the predominant principle. Hence the rea|&s;on
of that vulgar ob&s;ervation, that the highe&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="146">
zeal in religion and the deepe&s;t hypocri&s;y, &s;o far
from being incon&s;i&s;tent, are often or commonly
united in the &s;ame individual character.</P>
<P>The bad effects of &s;uch habits, even in com|mon
life, are ea&s;ily imagined: but where the in|tere&s;ts
of religion are concerned, no morality can
be forcible enough to bind the enthu&s;ia&s;tic zealot.
The &s;acredne&s;s of the cau&s;e &s;anctifies every mea|&s;ure,
which can be made u&s;e of to promote it.</P>
<P>The &s;teady attention alone to &s;o important an in|tere&s;t
as that of eternal &s;alvation is apt to extin|gui&s;h
the benevolent affections, and beget a nar|row,
contracted &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. And when &s;uch a
temper is encouraged, it ea&s;ily eludes all the ge|neral
precepts of charity and benevolence.</P>
<P>Thus the motives of vulgar &s;uper&s;tition have no
great influence on general conduct; nor is their
operation very favourable to morality, in the in|&s;tances,
where they predominate.</P>
<P>Is there any maxim in politics more certain and
infallible, than that both the number and autho|rity
of prie&s;ts &s;hould be confined within very nar|row
limits, and that the civil magi&s;trate ought,
for ever, to keep his <HI>fa&s;ces</HI> and <HI>axes</HI> from &s;uch
dangerous hands? But if the &s;pirit of popular
religion were &s;o &s;alutary to &s;ociety, a contrary
maxim ought to prevail. The greater number of
prie&s;ts, and their greater authority and riches will al|ways
augment the religious &s;pirit. And though the
prie&s;ts have the guidance of this &s;pirit, why may
we not expect a &s;uperior &s;anctity of life, and
<PB N="145" REF="147">
greater benevolence and moderation, from per|&s;ons
who are &s;et apart for religion, who are con|tinually
inculcating it upon others, and who mu&s;t
them&s;elves imbibe a greater &s;hare of it? Whence
comes it then, that in fact, the utmo&s;t a wi&s;e ma|gi&s;trate
can propo&s;e with regard to popular reli|gions,
is, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to make a &s;aving
game of it, and to prevent their pernicious con|&s;equences
with regard to &s;ociety. Every expe|dient
which he tries for &s;o humble a purpo&s;e is
&s;urrounded with inconveniencies. If he admits
only one religion among his &s;ubjects, he mu&s;t &s;a|crifice,
to an uncertain pro&s;pect of tranquillity,
every con&s;ideration of public liberty, &s;cience, rea|&s;on,
indu&s;try, and even his own independency.
If he gives indulgence to &s;everal &s;ects, which is
the wi&s;er maxim, he mu&s;t pre&s;erve a very philo&s;o|phical
indifference to all of them, and carefully
re&s;train the preten&s;ions of the prevailing &s;ect; o|therwi&s;e
he can expect nothing but endle&s;s di&s;|putes,
quarrels, factions, per&s;ecutions, and civil
commotions.</P>
<P>True religion, I allow, has no &s;uch pernicious
con&s;equences: but we mu&s;t treat of religion, as
it has commonly been found in the world; nor
have I any thing to do with that &s;peculative tenet
of Thei&s;m, which, as it is a &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy,
mu&s;t partake of the beneficial influence of that
principle, and at the &s;ame time mu&s;t lie under a
like inconvenience, of being always confined to
very few per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148">
Oaths are requi&s;ite in all courts of judicature;
but it is a que&s;tion whether their authority ari&s;es
from any popular religion. 'Tis the &s;olemnity and
importance of the occa&s;ion, the regard to re|putation,
and the reflecting on the general inter|e&s;ts
of &s;ociety, which are the chief re&s;traints up|on
mankind. Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e oaths and political
oaths are but little regarded even by &s;ome who
pretend to principles of hone&s;ty and religion: and
a Quaker's a&s;&s;everation is with us ju&s;tly put upon
the &s;ame footing with the oath of any other per|&s;on.
I know, that POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 54.</NOTE> a&s;cribes the in|famy
of GREEK faith to the prevalency of the
EPICUREAN philo&s;ophy; but I know al&s;o, that
PUNIC faith had as bad a reputation in ancient
times, as IRISH evidence has in modern; though
we cannot account for the&s;e vulgar ob&s;ervations by
the &s;ame rea&s;on. Not to mention, that GREEK
faith was infamous before the ri&s;e of the EPICU|REAN
philo&s;ophy; and EURIPIDES<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Iphigenia in Tauride.</NOTE>, in a pa&s;|&s;age
which I &s;hall point out to you, has glanced a
remarkable &s;troke of &s;atire again&s;t his nation,
with regard to this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Take care, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES, take
care: pu&s;h not matters too far: allow not your
zeal again&s;t fal&s;e religion to undermine your vene|ration
for the true. Forfeit not this principle, the
chief, the only great comfort in life; and our
<PB N="147" REF="149">
principal &s;upport amid&s;t all the attacks of adver&s;e
fortune. The mo&s;t agreeable reflection, which
it is po&s;&s;ible for human imagination to &s;ugge&s;t, is
that of genuine Thei&s;m, which repre&s;ents us as
the workman&s;hip of a Being perfectly good, wi&s;e,
and powerful; who created us for happine&s;s, and
who, having implanted in us immea&s;ureable de|&s;ires
of good, will prolong our exi&s;tence to all e|ternity,
and will transfer us into an infinite varie|ty
of &s;cenes, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e de&s;ires, and
render our felicity compleat and durable. Next
to &s;uch a Being him&s;elf (if the compari&s;on be al|lowed)
the happie&s;t lot which we can imagine, is
that of being under his guardian&s;hip and protec|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e appearances, &s;aid PHILO, are mo&s;t en|gaging
and alluring; and with regard to the true
philo&s;opher, they are more than appearances. But
it happens here, as in the former ca&s;e, that, with
regard to the greater part of mankind, the ap|pearances
are deceitful, and that the terrors of re|ligion
commonly prevail above its comforts.</P>
<P>It is allowed, that men never have recour&s;e to
devotion &s;o readily as when dejected with grief or
depre&s;&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s. Is not this a proof, that
the religious &s;pirit is not &s;o nearly allied to joy
as to &s;orrow?</P>
<P>But men, when afflicted, find con&s;olation in re|ligion,
replied CLEANTHES. Sometimes, &s;aid
PHILO: but it is natural to imagine, that they
will form a notion of tho&s;e unknown beings, &s;uit|ably
<PB N="148" REF="150">
to the pre&s;ent gloom and melancholy of their
temper, when they betake them&s;elves to the con|templation
of them. Accordingly, we find the
tremendous images to predominate in all reli|gions;
and we our&s;elves, after having employed
the mo&s;t exalted expre&s;&s;ion in our de&s;criptions of
the Deity, fall into the flatte&s;t contradiction, in af|firming,
that the damned are infinitely &s;uperior
in number to the elect.</P>
<P>I &s;hall venture to affirm, that there never was a
popular religion, which repre&s;ented the &s;tate of
departed &s;ouls in &s;uch a light, as would render it
eligible for human kind, that there &s;hould be &s;uch
a &s;tate. The&s;e fine models of religion are the
mere product of philo&s;ophy. For as death lies
between the eye and the pro&s;pect of futurity, that
event is &s;o &s;hocking to Nature, that it mu&s;t throw
a gloom on all the regions, which lie beyond it;
and &s;ugge&s;t to the generality of mankind the idea
of CERBERUS and furies; devils, and torrents of
fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>It is true; both fear and hope enter into reli|gion;
becau&s;e both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, at different
times, agitate the human mind, and each of them
forms a &s;pecies of divinity, &s;uitable to it&s;elf. But
when a man is in a chearful di&s;po&s;ition, he is fit
for bu&s;ine&s;s or company or entertainment of any
kind; and he naturally applies him&s;elf to the&s;e,
and thinks not of religion. When melancholy,
and dejected, he has nothing to do but brood up|on
the terrors of the invi&s;ible world, and to
<PB N="149" REF="151">
plunge him&s;elf &s;till deeper in affliction. It may,
indeed, happen, that after he has, in this manner,
ingraved the religious opinions deep into his
thought and imagination, there may arrive a
change of health or circum&s;tances, which may
re&s;tore his good humour, and rai&s;ing chearful pro|&s;pects
of futurity, make him run into the other
extreme of joy and triumph. But &s;till it mu&s;t be
acknowledged, that, as terror is the primary
principle of religion, it is the pa&s;&s;ion, which al|ways
predominates in it, and admits but of &s;hort
intervals of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Not to mention, that the&s;e fits of exce&s;&s;ive,
enthu&s;ia&s;tic joy, by exhau&s;ting the &s;pirits, always
prepare the way for equal fits of &s;uper&s;titious ter|ror
and dejection; nor is there any &s;tate of mind
&s;o happy as the calm and equable. But this &s;tate,
it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport, where a man thinks,
that he lies, in &s;uch profound darkne&s;s and un|certainty,
between an eternity of happine&s;s and an
eternity of mi&s;ery. No wonder, that &s;uch an o|pinion
disjoints the ordinary frame of the mind,
and throws it into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. And
though that opinion is &s;eldom &s;o &s;teady in its ope|ration
as to influence all the actions; yet is it apt
to make a con&s;iderable breach in the temper, and
to produce that gloom and melancholy, &s;o remark|able
in all devout people.</P>
<P>It is contrary to common &s;en&s;e to entertain ap|prehen&s;ions
or terrors, upon account of any opi|nion
what&s;oever, or to imagine that we run any
<PB N="150" REF="152">
ri&s;k hereafter, by the free&s;t u&s;e of our rea&s;on.
Such a &s;entiment implies both an <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> and
an <HI>incon&s;i&s;tency.</HI> It is an ab&s;urdity to believe that
the Deity has human pa&s;&s;ions, and one of the lowe&s;t
of human pa&s;&s;ions, a re&s;tle&s;s appetite for applau&s;e.
It is an incon&s;i&s;tency to believe, that, &s;ince the
Deity has this human pa&s;&s;ion, he has not others
al&s;o; and in particular, a di&s;regard to the opi|nions
of creatures, &s;o much inferior.</P>
<P><HI>To know God,</HI> &s;ays SENECA, <HI>is to wor&s;hip
him.</HI> All other wor&s;hip is indeed ab&s;urd, &s;u|per&s;titious,
and even impious. It degrades him
to the low condition of mankind, who are de|lighted
with intreaty, &s;olicitation, pre&s;ents, and
&s;lattery. Yet is this impiety the &s;malle&s;t of which
&s;uper&s;tition is guilty. Commonly, it depre&s;&s;es
the Deity far below the condition of mankind;
and repre&s;ents him as a capricious daemon, who
exerci&s;es his power without rea&s;on and without
humanity! And were that divine Being di&s;po&s;ed
to be offended at the vices and follies of &s;illy
mortals, who are his own workman&s;hip; ill would
it &s;urely fare with the votaries of mo&s;t popular
&s;uper&s;titions. Nor would any of human race me|rit
his <HI>favor,</HI> but a very few, the philo&s;ophical
Thei&s;ts, who entertain, or rather indeed endea|vour
to entertain, &s;uitable notions of his divine
perfections: As the only per&s;ons, intitled to his
<HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>indulgence,</HI> would be the philo&s;o|phical
Sceptics, a &s;ect almo&s;t equally rare, who,
from a natural diffidence of their own capacity,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
&s;u&s;pend, or endeavour to &s;u&s;pend all judgement
with regard to &s;uch &s;ublime and &s;uch extraordinary
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>If the whole of Natural Theology, as &s;ome
people &s;eem to maintain, re&s;olves it&s;elf into one
&s;imple, though &s;omewhat ambiguous, at lea&s;t
undefined propo&s;ition, <HI>That the cau&s;e or cau&s;es
of order in the univer&s;e probably bear &s;ome
remote analogy to human intelligence:</HI> If this
propo&s;ition be not capable of exten&s;ion, variation,
or more particular explication: If it affords no
inference that affects human life, or can be the
&s;ource of any action or forbearance: And if the
analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no
farther than to the human intelligence; and
cannot be transferred, with any appearance of
probability, to the other qualities of the mind:
If this really be the ca&s;e, what can the mo&s;t in|qui&s;itive,
contemplative, and religious man do
more than give a plain, philo&s;ophical a&s;&s;ent to
the propo&s;ition, as often as it occurs; and be|lieve
that the arguments, on which it is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
exceed the objections, which lie again&s;t it?
Some a&s;toni&s;hment indeed will naturally ari&s;e
from the greatne&s;s of the object: Some melan|choly
from its ob&s;curity: Some contempt of hu|man
rea&s;on, that it can give no &s;olution more
&s;atisfactory with regard to &s;o extraordinary and
magnificent a que&s;tion. But believe me, CLE|ANTHES,
the mo&s;t natural &s;entiment, which a
well-di&s;po&s;ed mind will feel on this occa&s;ion, is
<PB N="152" REF="154">
a longing de&s;ire and expectation, that heaven
would be plea&s;ed to di&s;&s;ipate, at lea&s;t alleviate
this profound ignorance, by affording &s;ome more
particular revelation to mankind, and making di&s;|coveries
of the nature, attributes, and operations
of the divine object of our faith. A per&s;on, &s;ea|&s;oned
with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the imperfections of
natural rea&s;on, will fly to revealed truth with the
greate&s;t avidity: While the haughty Dogmati&s;t,
per&s;uaded, that he can erect a complete &s;y&s;tem
of Theology by the mere help of philo&s;ophy,
di&s;dains any farther aid, and rejects this adven|titious
in&s;tructor. To be a philo&s;ophical Sceptic
is, in a man of letters, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
&s;tep towards being a &s;ound, believing Chri|&s;tian;
a propo&s;ition, which I would willingly re|commend
to the attention of PAMPHILUS: And
I hope CLEANTHES will forgive me for interpo|&s;ing
&s;o far in the education and in&s;truction of his
pupil.</P>
<P>CLEANTHES and PHILO pur&s;ued not this con|ver&s;ation
much farther; and as nothing ever
made greater impre&s;&s;ion on me, than all the rea|&s;onings
of that day; &s;o, I confe&s;s, that, upon a
&s;erious review of the whole, I cannot but think,
that PHILO's principles are more probable than
DEMEA's; but that tho&s;e of CLEANTHES ap|proach
&s;till nearer to the truth.</P>
