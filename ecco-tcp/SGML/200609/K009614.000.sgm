Is this his ob&s;erving the Legal Injunctions, (as one of his Cla&s;s calls them) of the King upon the Clergy?</P>
<P>Now &s;hould we call upon the Mini&s;try to do Ju&s;tice upon this Incendiary, and im|plore his Maje&s;ty, in his Ju&s;tice to the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in Vindication of his own Injunctions, to let this Offender be brought to condign Puni&s;h|ment: This I per&s;wade my &s;elf his Maje|&s;ty will not deny, or, that on the other hand, His Royal Ju&s;tice will move him to take off tho&s;e Injunctions from the Clergy of the Church, which they now lye under; the Re&s;traints whereof, they have, with Defe|rence to His Maje&s;ty, &s;trictly conformed to. What ju&s;t Complaints may the Clergy make of being hardly and unju&s;tly dealt with, if &s;uch a manife&s;t Breach of His Maje&s;ty's Commands &s;hall not be re&s;ented? Is it not expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid Injunctions, that the Breach thereof will incur his Royal Di&s;plea&s;ure, and that the King will give Charge to the Judges, and all their Civil Officers, to do their Duty towards prevent|ing and puni&s;hing &s;uch as &s;hall offend herein? And is it the Misfortune of the Church-Clergy
<PB N="14" REF="13">
only, to be capable of incurring his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure; and the Di&s;&s;enting Preachers, who, notwith&s;tanding they are only admitted, or &s;uffer'd to Preach, by a kind Exemption, from the Puni&s;hment due by the Law, to Schi&s;maticks and Recu&s;ants, may, without Offence, take that very Li|berty which the others are forbidden? What a de&s;olate, abandon'd Condition is the Church of <HI>England</HI> brought to, if this be her Fate? And where may we &s;uppo&s;e this will end?</P>
<P>But I will not per&s;wade any true Church|man to entertain a Thought &s;o prejudicial to the Honour of the King; neither will I pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t, that the King can hear &s;uch Things (if ever His Maje&s;ty &s;hall have Opportunity to hear them,) without the utmo&s;t Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Unhappy is the State of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if &s;uch Things can be practis'd in this Kingdom, and not one of Her Mem|bers be &s;o faithful to Her Intere&s;t, as to give a true impartial Account of this Mat|ter, to Her Head and Sworn Defender: But there is no room to doubt but &s;ome will be found, who will lay the&s;e Things before the King, and will inform His Maje|&s;ty who they are, that inflame and de&s;pi&s;e His Subjects, by bitter Invectives in their Sermons, and by &s;currilous Language in

their Pulpits, notwith&s;tanding His In|junction to the contrary; which, if done wi&s;ely, and with Clearne&s;s, will &s;oon con|vince His Maje&s;ty who they are that are the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Di&s;&s;atisfaction of his Subjects, and who they are that de&s;ire he may be the Peaceable and Gracious So|vereign Lord over all his People. It can &s;carce be believ'd, that the&s;e Men &s;hould make any Impre&s;&s;ion on His Maje&s;ty, by this way of Preaching and Printing; but &s;urely a faithful Account given to him of this Behaviour, in Defiance of his Injunction, mu&s;t make Impre&s;&s;ion on his Mind, very much to their Prejudice, and no le&s;s to the Advantage of the publick Peace, both in Church and State. Mean time, tho&s;e who think that this Management of him|&s;elf is becoming either the Per&s;on of this <HI>Bradbury,</HI> who calls him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter, or his Friends, the Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>quatenus</HI> Di&s;&s;en|ter, and tolerated by the Church, may en|courage him to proceed as he has begun; but a Time may come, when they may &s;ee them&s;elves mi&s;taken, and may find they un|&s;ea&s;onably di&s;cover'd the bloody Di&s;po&s;ition to be &s;o much their own: There are many among the Di&s;&s;enters, who are &s;en&s;ible of it already, and are only wanting, in that they do not think fit to do them&s;elves the Ju&s;tice to declare their Minds, which is

their Fear of the People, and le&s;t they &s;hould be ca&s;t out of the Synagogue, <HI>Loving the Prai&s;e of Men more,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From this Preaching Incendiary, I pro|ceed to the Lay-Preacher <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">t,</HI> who takes upon him, after a Series of Lewdne&s;s and Debauchery, in his former Life, to &s;et up for an In&s;tructor of Mini&s;try, and im|pudently tells the Mini&s;ters of State, the King's Maje&s;ty, and all, that he expects the la&s;t Mini&s;try &s;hould be &s;acrific'd to his Re&s;entments, and their Heads be given to him in a Charger, as that Lewd Dancer did to <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t.</P>
<P>Were this Demand made by a le&s;s fla|grant Villain, one that had not been the Shame, as well as Grief of his Father; the Scandal of his Family, and the Contempt of Men of Honour; or had it been by one who had not &s;ent his Right Reverend Fa|ther to Her late Maje&s;ty, to beg Mercy for him, and to entreat Her Maje&s;ty that a Ju&s;t Pro&s;ecution might be &s;top'd, which was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him, for in&s;ulting Her Royal Per&s;on and Government, which Ap|plication, the very &s;ame Per&s;ons, who&s;e Bloods he now thir&s;ts after, were earne&s;t Suiters to the Queen to accept, and promp|ted Her Native Clemency to Pardon a Man whom his own Father had nothing to &s;ay for, but meerly to ask it of her Grace and Good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the &s;ame Grace and Goodne&s;s which led Her to &s;pare many more, who now &s;tamp upon Her Memory, with the great|e&s;t Ingratitude and Contempt. Was this Demand, I &s;ay, made by one who had not thus been in Debt to the Men he would de&s;troy, &s;ome Room would have been left to believe, there might have been &s;ome|thing of a Publick Spirited Zeal in the Mo|tion, however extravagant in it&s;elf, and however it might be carried beyond the Bounds of Chri&s;tianity and Honour.</P>
<P>But, when a Man is put into a Rage by Envy, and in the height of a Party Di&s;tra|ction, calls out for Blood, and demands the Heads of &s;uch as he and his Fellow Furies have thought fit to pre&s;cribe, it is Time then to let the World know the Meaning of the&s;e Things, and what is to be &s;aid, or done in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Actions of every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man are to be enquir'd into by Legal Proce&s;s; heard in due Form, and judg'd by the proper Per&s;ons. It is Criminal for any One to tamper with the Juries, who are to pa&s;s upon any Man in Ca&s;es of Life and Death; to offer to Bribe, or Pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s them ei|ther to Acquit or Condemn; it is not there|fore allowed for any Man to enter upon his own Vindication in Publick, while his Ca&s;e is depending in any Court of Ju&s;tice,

becau&s;e it is anticipating his Tryal, and a pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the People out of whom his Jury is to be Cho&s;en, and con&s;equently pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and tampering with the Ju|ry it&s;elf, in like manner, ought not to be allowed: That Men who are liable to be que&s;tion'd, in Publick, for any Actions which they may have done, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to be Illegal, &s;hould be arraigned be|fore Hand in Publick, by every Lewd Scribler, who, in this re&s;pect, pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the World again&s;t them as much as in him lies; find him Guilty before he is Tryed, and Execute him as it were in Effigie: When &s;uch Methods are made u&s;e of to make Men publickly Obnoxious, it is a plain over awing tho&s;e, who may come to pa&s;s upon the&s;e Men for Life or Death, who are made afraid to do Ju&s;tice, lea&s;t they are mark'd out for the &s;ame popular Hatred.
