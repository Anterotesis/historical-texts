<P>_I Am not unacquainted, that, ever &s;ince this Book was fir&s;t promis'd by way of Adverti&s;e|ment to the World, it was greedily co|veted by a great many Per&s;ons of any Tempers, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that it has been condemn'd by tho&s;e of a more
<PB N="4" REF="4">
formal Cla&s;s, who thought it was cal|culated partly to introduce a great ma|ny new and diverting Curio&s;ities in the way of Super&s;tition, and partly to di|vulge the &s;ecret Intrigues and Amours of one part of the Sex, to give the other part room to make favourite Scan|dal the Subject of their Di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;o to make one half of the fair Species very merry, over the Blu&s;hes and the Mortifications of the other half. But when they come to read the following Sheets, they will find their Expecta|tions di&s;appointed, (but I hope I may &s;ay too) very agreeably di&s;appointed. They will find a much more elegant Entertainment than they expected. In|&s;tead of making them a Bill of Fare out of patchwork Romances of polluting Scandal; the good old Gentleman who wrote the Adventures of my Life, has made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to treat them with a great variety of entertaining Pa&s;&s;a|ges which always terminate in Morals, that tend to the Edification of all Rea|ders
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of what&s;oever Sex, Age, or Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. In&s;tead of &s;educing young, in|nocent, unwary Minds into the vicious delight, which is too often taken in reading the gay and bewitching Chi|meras of the <HI>Caballi&s;ts,</HI> and in per|u&s;ing the inticing Fables of new-invent|ed Tricks of Super&s;tition, my ancient Friend, the Writer, &s;trikes at the very Root of the&s;e Super&s;titions, and &s;hews them, how they may be &s;atisfy'd in their &s;everal Curio&s;ities, by having re|cour&s;e to time, who by the Talent of the Second-&s;ight (which he &s;o beauti|fully repre&s;ents, how Nature is &s;o kind frequently to implant in the Minds of Men born in the &s;ame Climate with my&s;elf) can tell you tho&s;e things na|turally, which when you try to learn your &s;elves, you either run the Hazard of being impos'd upon in your Pockets by Cheats, Gyp&s;ies and common Fortune|tellers, or el&s;e of being impos'd upon, in a &s;till wor&s;e way, in your mo&s;t la&s;t|ing Welfare, by having recour&s;e to
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Conjurers or Inchanters that deal in Black Arts, and involve all their Con|&s;ulters in one general Partner&s;hip of their execrable Guilt; or la&s;tly, of impo&s;ing wor&s;t of all on your own &s;elves, by getting into an Itch of practi&s;ing and trying the little Tricks of Female Super&s;tition, which are often more officiou&s;ly handed down, by the Tra|dition of credulous Nur&s;es and old Wo|men, from one Generation to another, than the fir&s;t Principles of Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which 'tis their Duty to in&s;til early into little Children. But I hope when this Book comes to be pretty generally read among you La|dies, (as by your generous and numerous Sub&s;criptions, I have good rea&s;on to expect) that it will afford a perfect Remedy and a thorough Cure to that Di&s;temper, which fir&s;t took its Ri&s;e from too great a Growth of Curio&s;ity, and too large a Stock of Credulity nur|&s;ed prejudicially up with you in your more tender and infant Years.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
Whatever young Maid hereafter has an innocent but longing De&s;ire to know who &s;hall be her Husband, and what time &s;he &s;hall be marry'd, will, I hope, when &s;he has read in the fol|lowing Sheets of a Man that can &s;et her right in the Knowledge of tho&s;e Points, purely by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Gift of the Second-&s;ight, &s;ooner have re|cour&s;e innocently to &s;uch a Man than u&s;e unlawful Means to acquire it, &s;uch as running to Conjurers to have his Figure &s;hewn in their inchanted Gla&s;&s;es, or u&s;ing any of tho&s;e traditio|nal Super&s;titions, by which they may dream of their Husbands, or cau&s;e vi&s;ionary Shapes of them to appear on &s;uch and &s;uch Fe&s;tival Nights of the Year; all which Practi&s;es are not ordinarily wicked and impious, but downright diabolical. I hope that the next twenty ninth of <HI>June,</HI> which is St. <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t's Day, I &s;hall not &s;ee the &s;everal Pa&s;ture Fields adjacent
<PB N="8" REF="8">
to this Metropolis, e&s;pecially that be|hind <HI>Montague</HI> Hou&s;e, throng'd, as they were the la&s;t Year, with well dre&s;t young Ladies crawling bu&s;ily up and down upon their Knees, as if they were a parcel of Weeders, when all the Bu&s;ine&s;s is to hunt &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly after a Coal under the Root of a Plan|tain, to put under their Heads that Night, that they may dream who &s;hould be their Husbands. In order to &s;hame them out of this &s;illy but guilty Practice, I do intend to have &s;ome Spies out on that Day, that &s;hall di&s;|cover who they are, and what they have been about; and I here give notice to the Publick, that this ill-acted Co|medy (if it be acted at all this Year) mu&s;t begin according to the Rule of their Super&s;tition, on that Day preci&s;ely at the Hour of Twelve. And &s;o much for the pretty Weeders: But as you (Ladies) have had &s;everal Magical Traditions deliver'd to you, which, if you put in Exerci&s;e and Practice, will
<PB N="9" REF="9">
be greatly prejudicial to your Honour and your Virtue; let me interpo&s;e my Coun&s;els, which will conduct you inno|cuou&s;ly to the &s;ame end, which &s;ome Ladies have labour'd to arrive at by the&s;e Impieties. Give me leave fir&s;t to tell you, that tho' what you aim at may be arriv'd to by the&s;e Means, yet the&s;e Means make that a mi&s;erable Fortune which would have been a good one; becau&s;e in order to know human Things beforehand, you u&s;e preterna|tural Mediums, which de&s;troy the Goodne&s;s of the Cour&s;es, which Nature her &s;elf was taking for you, and an|nexes to them diabolical Influences, which commonly carry along with them Fatalities in this World as well as the next. You will therefore give me your Pardon likewi&s;e, Ladies, if I relate &s;ome other of the&s;e Practices, which bare relation of it &s;elf, after what I have &s;aid before, &s;eems to me &s;ufficient to explode them.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">
Another of the Nur&s;es Pre&s;criptions is this. Upon a St. <HI>Agnes</HI>'s Night, the 21&s;t Day of <HI>January,</HI> take a Row of Pins and pull out every one, one after another, &s;aying a <HI>Pater no&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Our Father,</HI> &s;ticking a Pin in your Sleeve, and you will dream of her you &s;hall marry. <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> in one of his Ma&s;kes makes &s;ome mention of this.<Q><L>And on &s;weet St. <HI>Agnes</HI> Night</L>
<L>Plea&s;e you with the promis'd &s;ight,</L>
<L>Some of Hu&s;bands, &s;ome of Lovers.</L>
<L>Which an empty Dream di&s;covers.</L></Q> Now what can be more infinitely pro|phane than to u&s;e the Prayer of our Lord in&s;tituted in &s;uch a way?</P>
<P>There is another Pre&s;cription, which is as follows: You mu&s;t lie in another County, and knit the left Garter about the right-legg'd Stocking (let the other
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Garter and Stocking alone) and as you rehear&s;e the&s;e following Ver&s;es, at eve|ry Comma knit a Knot.<Q><L>This Knot I knit,</L>
<L>To know the thing I know not yet,</L>
<L>That I may &s;ee</L>
<L>The Man that &s;hall my Hu&s;band be:</L>
<L>How he goes, and what he wears,</L>
<L>And what he does all Days and Years.</L></Q> Accordingly in your Dream you will &s;ee him: If a Mu&s;itian with a Lute or other In&s;trument; if a Scholar with a Book, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now I appeal to you, Ladies, what a ridiculous Pre&s;cription is this? But yet as &s;light a thing as it is, it may be of great Importance if it be brought about, becau&s;e then it mu&s;t be con&s;trued to be done by preter|natural Means, and then tho&s;e Words are nothing le&s;s than an Application to the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">
Mr. <HI>Awbrey</HI> of the Royal Society &s;ays, a Gentlewoman, that he knew, confe&s;&s;ed in his hearing that &s;he u&s;ed this Method, and dreamt of her Hu&s;|band whom &s;he had never &s;een: About two or three Years after, as &s;he was one Sunday at Church, up pops a young <HI>Oxonian</HI> in the Pulpit; &s;he cries out pre&s;ently to her Si&s;ter, this is the very Face of the Man I &s;aw in my Dream. Sir <HI>William Somes</HI>'s Lady did the like.</P>
<P>Another way is to charm the Moon thus, (as the old Nur&s;es give out) at the fir&s;t Appearance of the Moon after New-years-day, (&s;ome &s;ay any other New Moon is as good) go out in the Evening, and &s;tand over the Sparrs of a Gate or Stile, looking on the Moon (here remark that in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> they kneel on a Ground-fa&s;t Stone) and &s;ay,<Q><PB N="13" REF="13">
<L>All hail to the Moon, all hail to thee,</L>
<L>I prithee good Moon reveal to me</L>
<L>This Night who my Hu&s;band &s;hall be.</L></Q> You mu&s;t pre&s;ently after go to Bed: The afore&s;aid Mr. <HI>Awbrey</HI> knew two Gentlewomen that did thus when they were young Maids, and they had Dreams of tho&s;e that married them.</P>
<P>But a great many of the wittie&s;t part of your Sex laugh at the&s;e common Super&s;titions; but then they are apt to run into wor&s;e: They give them&s;elves up to the reading of the <HI>Cabali&s;tical</HI> Sy&s;tems of <HI>Sylphs,</HI> and <HI>Gnomes,</HI> and <HI>Mandrakes,</HI> which are very wicked and delu&s;ive Imaginations.</P>
<P>I would not have you imagin (La|dies) that I impute the&s;e things as In|firmities and Frailties peculiar to your Sex. No; Men, and great Men too,
<PB N="14" REF="14">
and Scholars, and even State&s;men and Princes them&s;elves have been tainted with Super&s;titions; and where they in|fect the Minds of &s;uch great Per&s;ona|ges, they make the deeper Impre&s;&s;ion, according to the &s;tronger and more man|ly Ideas they have of them. Their greater degree of Strength in the In|tellect only &s;ubjects them to greater Weakne&s;&s;es; &s;uch was even the great <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> the Wonder and Miracle of Learning in the Age wherein he liv|ed, and &s;uch were all his Followers, Scholars, State&s;men, Divines, and Princes that are <HI>Tali&s;mani&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> that <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> pretends to owe to the Excogitation and Invention of hone&s;t Art, &s;eem to me to be of a very diabolical Nature, and to owe their Ri&s;e to being dedicated by the Author to the Heathen Gods. Thus the <HI>Cabali&s;ts</HI> pretending to a va&s;t Penetration into Arts and Sciences (tho' all their Thoughts are Chimeras and
<PB N="15" REF="15">
Extravagancies, unle&s;s they be help'd by preternatural Means) &s;ay they have found out the &s;everal Methods appro|priated to the &s;everal Planets: They have appropriated Gold to the Sun on the <HI>Sunday,</HI> Silver to the Moon on the <HI>Monday,</HI> Iron to <HI>Mars</HI> on the <HI>Tue&s;|day,</HI> Quick&s;ilver to <HI>Mercury</HI> on the Wedne&s;day, Tin to <HI>Jupiter</HI> on the <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> Copper or Bra&s;s to <HI>Venus</HI> on the <HI>Friday,</HI> and Lead to <HI>Saturn</HI> on the <HI>Saturday.</HI> The Methods they take in forming the&s;e <HI>Tali&s;mans</HI> are too long to dwell upon here. But the Properties which they pretend belong to them are, that the fir&s;t <HI>Tali&s;man</HI> or Seal of the Sun will make a Man beloved by all Princes and Potentates, and cau&s;e him to abound with all the Riches his Heart can wi&s;h. The &s;e|cond pre&s;erves Travellers from Dan|ger, and is favourable to Merchants, Trade&s;men, and Workmen. The third carries De&s;truction to any place where it is put; and 'tis &s;aid that a certain
<PB N="16" REF="16">
great Mini&s;ter of State order'd one of the&s;e to be carry'd into <HI>England</HI> in the Times of the Revolution of Govern|ment cau&s;ed by <HI>Oliver Cromwell.</HI> The fourth they pretend cures Fevers and other Di&s;ea&s;es; and if it be put under the Bol&s;ter, it makes the Pro|prietor have true Dreams, in which he &s;ees all he de&s;ires to know. The fifth, according to them, renders a Man lucky and fortunate in all his Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es and Undertakings. It di&s;&s;i|pates Melancholy, drives away all importunate Cares, and bani&s;hes pa|nick Fears from the Mind. The &s;ixth, by being put into the Liquor which any one drinks, reconciles mortal Enemies, makes them intimate Friends; it gains the Love of all Women, and renders the Proprietor very dextrous in the Art of Mu&s;ick. The &s;eventh makes Women be ea&s;ily brought to Bed without Pain; and if a Hor&s;eman carries it in his left Boot, him&s;elf and his Hor&s;e become invulnerable.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">
This <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> and his learned Followers &s;ay is owing to the In&s;luence of the Stars; but I can't help argu|ing the&s;e Acts of diabolical Impiety. But as the&s;e Arts are rarely known a|mong the midling part of Mankind, I &s;hall neither open their My&s;teries, nor inveigh again&s;t them any farther.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons, who are mo&s;t to be avoided, are your ordinary Fortune|telling Women and Men about this Town, who&s;e Hou&s;es ought to be a|voided as a Plague or a Pe&s;tilence, either becau&s;e they are Cheats and Impo&s;tors, or becau&s;e they deal with Black Arts, none of them that I know having any Preten&s;ions to the Gift of a Second-&s;ight. Among many, a few of the mo&s;t notorious, that I can call to mind now, are as follow. The fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t of the&s;e mi&s;chievous For|tune-tellers is a Woman that does not live far from the <HI>Old Bailey.</HI> And
<PB N="18" REF="18">
truly the Ju&s;tice Hall in that Place is the propere&s;t Place for her to appear at, where, if &s;he was try'd for pre|tending to give Charms written upon Paper with odd Scrawls, which &s;he calls Figures, &s;he would be probably convicted, and very ju&s;tly condemn'd, and doom'd to have her <HI>la&s;t</HI> Journey from the <HI>Old Bailey</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Tyburn.</HI> The other is a Fellow that lives in <HI>Moor|fields,</HI> in which Place, tho&s;e who go to con&s;ult him, ought to live all their Life-times at the famous Palaces of the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Men: He is the Succe&s;&s;or of the famous Dr. <HI>Trotter,</HI> who&s;e Widow he marry'd; and from being a Taylor and patching Mens Garments, he now cuts Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="7+ letters"> with his Sheers upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, con&s;iders the Hea|vens as a Garment, and from the Spangles thereupon, he calculates Na|tivities, and &s;ets up for a very pro|found A&s;trologer. The third is an ig|norant Fellow that <HI>kaws</HI> out &s;trange
<PB N="19" REF="19">
Predictions in <HI>Crow-Alley,</HI> of who&s;e croaking Noi&s;e I &s;hall here take no Notice, he having been &s;ufficiently mawl'd in the mo&s;t ingenious <HI>Specta|tors.</HI> The&s;e and &s;uch Counterfeits as the&s;e I would de&s;ire all Gentlemen and Ladies to avoid. The only two really learned Men, that I ever knew in the Art of A&s;trology, were my good Friends Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gad|bury;</HI> and I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pay this E&s;teem to their <HI>Manes,</HI> let the World judge of them what it will. I will here &s;ay no more, nor hinder you any longer, Gentlemen and Ladies, from the Diver&s;ion which my good old Friend, who is now departed this Life, has prepared for you in his Book, which a young Gentleman of my Ac|quaintance revi&s;ed, and only &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_OF all the Writings delivered in a Hi&s;torical manner to the World; none certainly were ever held in greater E&s;teem than tho&s;e, which give us the Lives of di&s;tingui&s;hed private Men at full length; and, as I may &s;ay, to the
<PB N="2" REF="25">
Life. Such curious Fragments of <HI>Biography</HI> are the Rarities, which great Men &s;eek after with eager Indu&s;try, and, when found; prize them as the Chief Jewels and Ornaments, that enrich their Libraries: And de&s;ervedly; for they are the Beauties of the greate&s;t Men's Lives handed down by way of Example or In&s;truction to Po&s;terity, and commonly hand|ed down likewi&s;e by the greate&s;t Men. Since therefore, Per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed for Merit in one Kind or other, are the con&s;tant Subjects of &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, and the mo&s;t Elegant Writers of each Age have been u&s;ually the only Authors, who chu&s;e upon &s;uch Subjects to employ their Pens, and &s;ince Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank, and Dignity, and <HI>Genij</HI> of the mo&s;t refined and delicate Reli&s;h, are fre|quently curious enough to be the Readers of them, and to e&s;teem them the mo&s;t valuable Pieces in a whole Collection of Learned Works. It is a Wonder to me, that when any Man's Life has &s;omething in it peculiarly Great and Remarkable in its Kind, it &s;hould not move &s;ome more skilful Writer than my &s;elf to give the Publick a Ta&s;te of it, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t va&s;tly Entertaining, if it be not, which is next to impo&s;&s;ible, immen&s;ly In&s;tructive and Profitable withal.</P>
<P>If ever the Life of any Man under the Sun was Remarkable, this Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI>'s, which I am going to treat upon, is &s;o, to a very eminent Degree.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="26">
It affords &s;uch variety of Incidents, and is accompanied with &s;uch diver&s;ity of Cir|cum&s;tances, that it includes within it, what mu&s;t yield entire Satisfaction to the mo&s;t lear|ned, and Admiration to Per&s;ons of a mode|rate Under&s;tanding. The Prince and the Pea&s;ant will have their &s;everal Ends of wor|thy Delight in reading it; and Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s Life is of that Extent, that it concerns and collects (as I may &s;ay) within it &s;elf eve|ry Station of Life in the Univer&s;e. Be&s;ides, There is a Demand in almo&s;t every Page, that relates any new Act of his, for the fine&s;t and clo&s;e&s;t Di&s;qui&s;itions that Learning can make upon human Nature, to account how tho&s;e Acts could be done by him. For he daily practi&s;ed, and &s;till practices tho&s;e Things naturally, which puts Art to the rack to find out how Nature can &s;o operate in him; and his fle&s;hly Body, by the&s;e Operations, is a living practical Sy&s;tem or Body of new Phi|lo&s;ophy, which exceeds even all tho&s;e that have hitherto been compounded by the Labor and Art of many Ages.</P>
<P>If one that had &s;peculated deep into ab|&s;tru&s;e matters, and made it his Study, not only to know, how to a&s;&s;ign natural Rea&s;ons for &s;ome &s;trange new Acts, that looked like Miracles by being peculiar to the individual Genius of &s;ome particular admired Man, but carrying his Enquiry to a much greater height had &s;peculated likewi&s;e, what might

po&s;&s;ibly be achieved by human Genius in the full Perfection of Nature, and had laid it down as a <HI>The&s;is</HI> by &s;trong Arguments, that &s;uch Things might be compa&s;&s;ed by a human Genius (if in its true degree of Perfection) as are the hourly Operations of the Per&s;on's Life I am writing, he would have been coun|ted a wild Romantick Enthu&s;ia&s;t, in&s;tead of a Natural Philo&s;opher. Some of the wi&s;e&s;t would be Infidels to &s;o new and &s;o refined a Scheme of Thinking, and demand Experiment, or cry it was all again&s;t Rea&s;on, and would not allow the lea&s;t Tittle to be true without it. Yet the Man that had found out &s;o great a My&s;te|ry, as to tell us, what Might be done by Hu|man Genius, as it is here actually done, would have been a great Man within him&s;elf; but wanting farther, Experimental Proof could lay no claim to the Belief of others, or con&s;equently to their E&s;teem: But how great then is the Man, who makes it con&s;tantly his Practice, actually to Do, what would not otherwi&s;e have been thought to be of &s;uch a Nature, as might ever be acquired by mortal Capacity, tho' in its full Complement of all po&s;&s;ible Perfection? He is not only great within him&s;elf, he is great to the World; his Experiments force our Belief, and the a|mazing Singularity of tho&s;e Experiments, provokes both our Wonder and E&s;teem.</P>
<P>If any learned Man &s;hould have advanced this Propo&s;ition, that meer human Art could
<PB N="5" REF="28">
give to the Deaf-Man, what &s;hould be equal to his Hearing, and to the Dumb-Man an equi|valent for his want of Speech, &s;o that he &s;hould conver&s;e as freely almo&s;t, as other Hearing or Talking Per&s;ons, that he might tho' born Deaf, be by Art taught, how to Read, Write, and under&s;tand any Language, as well as Students that have their Hearing, would not the World, and many even of the Learned Part of it &s;ay, that nothing could be more extravagantly Wild, more Mad and Frantick? The learned Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> Geome|try Profe&s;&s;or of <HI>Oxford,</HI> did fir&s;t of all lay down this Propo&s;ition, and was counted by many to have over&s;hot the Point of Learning, and to have been the Author of a whim&s;ical The&s;is. And I &s;hould not have wondered, if, after a Man's having a&s;&s;erted This might be done before it was actually done, &s;ome blind devout People, in tho&s;e Days, had ac|cu&s;ed him of Here&s;y, and of attributing to Men a Power of working Miracles. The Notion of the <HI>Antipodes</HI> was by the mo&s;t lear|ned Men of the Age in which St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> lived, and by the Great St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> him&s;elf treated in no milder a manner; yet if the Abi|lity of teaching the Deaf and the Dumb a Lan|guage, proved a Truth in Experience after|wards, ought not tho&s;e to turn their Con|tempt into Admiration, ought not tho&s;e very People to Vote him into the Royal Society for laying down this Propo&s;ition, who, before it proved true in Fact, would have been very

forward to have &s;ent him to <HI>Bedlam?</HI> The fir&s;t In&s;tance of this Accompli&s;hment in a Dumb Per&s;on, was proved before King <HI>Charles</HI> II. by this &s;ame Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> who was a Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and one of the mo&s;t ingenious of that Society.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this, &s;hould I come afterwards and &s;ay, that there is now living a Deaf and Dumb Man, and born &s;o, who could by dint of his own Genius teach all others Deaf and Dumb to Read, Write, and Conver&s;e with the Talking and Hearing Part of Mankind, &s;ome would, I warrant, very religiou&s;ly conclude, that I was about to in|troduce &s;ome &s;trange new Miracle-Monger and Impo&s;tor into the World; with a De&s;ign of &s;etting up &s;ome new Sect of Antichri&s;tian|i&s;m, as formidable as that of the <HI>Brachmans.</HI> Should I proceed &s;till farther and &s;ay, that this &s;ame Per&s;on &s;o Deaf and Dumb, might be able al&s;o to &s;hew a pre&s;aging Power, or kind of prophetical Genius (if I may be al|lowed the Expre&s;&s;ion) by telling, any &s;trange Per&s;ons, he never &s;aw before in his Life, their Names at fir&s;t Sight in Writing, and by tell|ing them the pa&s;t Actions of their Lives, and predicting to them determined Truths of fu|ture Contingencies; notwith&s;tanding what Divines &s;ay, that <HI>In futuris contingentibus non datur determinata veritas,</HI> would not they conclude that I was going to u&s;her in a new <HI>Mahomet?</HI> Since therefore there does exi&s;t &s;uch a Man in <HI>London,</HI> who actually is Deaf

And while we are relating the plea&s;ant Adventures with &s;uch prodigious Variety, can any thing be more agreeably in&s;tructive in a New Way, than to inter&s;per&s;e the Rea&s;ons, and account for the manner how Nature, having a mind to be remarkable, performs by him Acts &s;o my&s;te|rious.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Mr. CAMPBELL'S <HI>De&s;cent, Family, Birth,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OF the Goodne&s;s and Antiquity of the Name and Family of this Gentle|man, No body can ever make any Que&s;ti|on: He is a <HI>Campbell,</HI> Lineally De&s;cended from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Argyll,</HI> and bears a di|&s;tant Relation to the pre&s;ent Duke of that Name in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and who is now Con&s;ti|tuted a Duke of <HI>England,</HI> by the Stile and Title of the Duke of <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>It happens frequently, that the Birth of Extraordinary Per&s;ons is &s;o long di&s;puted by different People, each claiming him for their own, that the real p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> where he fir&s;t took
<PB N="9" REF="32">
Breath grows at la&s;t dubious: And thus it fares with the Per&s;on, who is the Subject of the following Sheets; as therefore it is my Propo&s;al to have a &s;trict regard to <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith,</HI> &s;o am I obliged to tell the Reader that I can with no certainty give an Account of him, till after he was Three Years Old; from which Age I knew him even to this Day: I will An&s;wer for the Truths which I impart to the Publick during that Time, and as for his Birth and the Circum&s;tances of it, and how the fir&s;t Three Years of his Life pa&s;&s;ed; I can only deliver them the &s;ame Account I have received from others, and leave them to their own Judgments, whether it ought to be deemed Real or Fabulous.</P>
<P>The Father of our Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> (as the&s;e relate the Story) was from his Infancy of a very curious inqui&s;itive Nature, and of an Enterprizing Genius, and if he heard of any thing Suprizing to be &s;een, the Difficulty in Practi&s;e was enough to recom|mend to him the attempting to get a &s;ight of it at any rate or any Hazard. It is certain, that during &s;ome Civil broils and troubles in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Grandfather of our Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> was driven with his Wife and Family by the Fate of War into the I&s;le of <HI>Schetland,</HI> where he lived many Years, and during his Re&s;idence there, Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell,</HI> the Father of our <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> was Born.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="33">
<HI>Schetland</HI> lies North-Ea&s;t from <HI>Orkney,</HI> between 60 and 61 Degrees of Latitude. The large&s;t I&s;le of <HI>Schetland</HI> by the Natives called the <HI>Main-Land,</HI> is &s;ixty Miles in Length, from South-We&s;t to the North-Ea&s;t, and from &s;ixteen, to one Mile, in Breadth.</P>
<P>The People who Live in the &s;maller I&s;les have abundance of Eggs and Fowl, which Contributes to maintain their Families du|ring the Summer.</P>
<P>The ordinary Folks are mo&s;tly very nim|ble and active in climbing the Rocks in que&s;t of tho&s;e Eggs and Fowl. This Exerci&s;e is far more diverting than Hunting and Hawking among us, and would certainly for the Plea|&s;ure of it, be followed by People of greater Di&s;tinction, was it not attended with very great Dangers, &s;ufficient to turn &s;port into &s;orrow, and which have often proved fatal to tho&s;e who too eagerly pur&s;ue their Game. Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell</HI> however delighted extreamly in this way of Fowling, and u&s;ed to conde&s;cend to mix with the common People for Company, becau&s;e none of the Youths of his Rank and Condition were ven|ture&s;ome enough to go along with him.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable Experiment of this &s;ort, is at the I&s;le called the <HI>No&s;s</HI> of <HI>Bra&s;&s;ah:</HI> The <HI>No&s;s</HI> &s;tanding at &s;ixteen fathom di&s;tance from the &s;ide of the Oppo&s;ite Main; the higher and lower Rocks have two Stakes fa&s;tened in each of them, and to the&s;e there

<PB N="11" REF="35">
are Ropes tied: Upon the Ropes there is an Engine hung which they call a Cradle, and in this a Man makes his way over from the greater to the &s;maller Rocks, where he makes a Con&s;iderable purcha&s;e of Eggs and Fowl; but his return being by an A&s;cent, makes it the more Dangerous, tho' tho&s;e on the great Rock have a Rope tied to the Cra|dle, by which they draw it and the Man &s;afe over for the mo&s;t part? Over this Rock Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell</HI> and five others were in that manner let down by Cradles and Ropes; but before they could be all drawn back again it grew Dark, and their A&s;&s;oci|ates not daring to be benighted, were forced to withdraw, and Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> was the un|fortunate Per&s;on left behind, having wan|dered too far, and not minded how the Day declined being intent on his Game. He pa&s;&s;ed that Night, you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, without much Sleep, and with great Anxiety of Heart. The night too as he lay in the open Air was, to add to his Misfortune, as Boi&s;te|rous and Tempe&s;tuous as his own mind; but in the end the Tempe&s;t proved very hap|py for him: The Reader is to under&s;tand that the <HI>Hamburghers, Bremeners</HI> and <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> carry on a great Fi&s;h Trade there. Accordingly a <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that was ju&s;t coming in the &s;ound of <HI>Bra&s;&s;ah,</HI> was by this Tempe&s;t driven into a Creek of the Rock, which Nature had made into a Harbonr,
<PB N="12" REF="36">
and they were Providentially &s;aved from the bottom of the Sea by a Rock, from which humanly &s;peaking they could expect nothing but De&s;truction, and being &s;ent to the bot|tom of that Sea. As never could a Man be taken hold of with &s;o &s;udden and &s;urprizing a Di&s;a&s;ter, &s;o no body could meet with a more &s;udden and &s;urprizing Relief than Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> found, when he &s;aw a Ship &s;o near. He made to the Ve&s;&s;el, and begged the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to take him in; they asked him what he would give them, or &s;aid the Barbarous Sailors, we will even leave you where you are; he told them his di&s;a&s;ter, but they asked Money and nothing el&s;e would move them: As he knew them a &s;elf inte|re&s;ted People, he bethought him&s;elf, that if he &s;hould tell them of the plenty of Fowls and Eggs they would get there; he might not only be taken in a Pa&s;&s;enger, but made a Partner in the Money ari&s;ing from the Stock; It &s;ucceeded accordingly, when he propo&s;ed it, the whole Crew were all at Work, and in four hours, pretty well &s;tored the Ve&s;&s;el, and then returning on board &s;et Sail for <HI>Holland.</HI> They offered Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> to put him in at his own I&s;land: But having a mind to &s;ee <HI>Holland,</HI> and being a Partner, to learn their way of Merchandize: which he thought he might turn to hi, Country Mens Advantage, he told them he would go the Voyage out with them, and &s;ee
<PB N="13" REF="37">
the Country of tho&s;e who were his De|liverers, a nece&s;&s;ary way of Speech, when one has a De&s;ign to &s;ooth <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who but for Intere&s;t would have left him unre|deemed, and for ought they knew a perpetual &s;ole Inhabitant of a Dreadful Rock, incom|pa&s;&s;ed round with Precipices, &s;ome, three hun|dred Fathom high. Not &s;o, the I&s;landers (who are wrongly called a Savage &s;et of Mortals) no, they came in que&s;t of him after &s;o bitter a Night, not doubting to find him, but fearing to find him in a Lamentable Con|dition: they hunted and ran&s;acked every lit|tle hole and corner in the Rock, but all in vain. In one place they &s;aw a great Slaugh|ter of Fowls enough to &s;erve forty Families for a Week; and then they Gue&s;&s;ed, tho' they had not the ill Fortune to meet the Eagles frequently noted to hover about tho&s;e I&s;les, that they might have Devoured part of him on &s;ome Precipice of the Rock, and dropt the Remnant into the Sea. Night came upon them, and they were afraid of falling into the &s;ame Di&s;a&s;ter, they went to relieve Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> from. They returned each to their proper Basket, and were drawn up &s;afe by their re&s;pective Friends, who were amazed that one Basket was drawn up empty which was let down for Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> and that there was not the lea&s;t Intelligence to be had Concerning him, but the Suppo&s;iti|ous Story of his having been Devour'd by
<PB N="14" REF="38">
Eagles. The Story was told at Home; and with the Lamentation of the whole Family, and all his Friends; he was looked upon to be Murthered or Dead.</P>
<P>Return we now to Mr. <HI>Archibald Camp|bell</HI> &s;till alive, and on Board the <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; &s;ecure as he thought within him&s;elf, that from the Delivery he lately had by the Gift of Providence, he was not intended to be liable to any more Misfortunes and Dan|gers of Life, in the Compa&s;s of &s;o &s;mall a Voyage. But his Lot was placed otherwi&s;e in the Book of Fate, than he too fondly imagined: His Time of Happine&s;s was dated &s;ome Pages lower down, and more rubs and difficulties were to be Encountered with, before his Stars intended to lead him to the Port of Felicity. Ju&s;t as he Arrived with|in &s;ight of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> a Terrible Storm aro&s;e, and in Danger of their Lives, for many Hours, they Weathered out the Tempe&s;t; and a Calm promi&s;ing fair afre&s;h, they made to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zealand;</HI> but a new Hurricane prevented the Ship from coming there al&s;o; and after having lo&s;t their Ma&s;ts and Rig|ging, they were driven into <HI>Lapland.</HI> There they went a Shore in order to carren and repair their Ship, and take in Provi&s;ions, while the Ship was Repairing by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> our I&s;lander made merry with the Inhabi|tants, being the mo&s;t inclined to their Super|&s;titious Cu&s;toms; he there became acquainted
<PB N="15" REF="39">
with a very Beautiful Woman, who fell in Love with him, and after a very &s;hort &s;pace of Time he Married her. About the Time when the Ship departed, his Wife who was very Rich, was big with Child of a Son, name|ly, Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell.</HI> He wrote a Letter by the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el to his Parents, in <HI>Schetland,</HI> concerning the various Adventures he had met with, which was delivered the <HI>June</HI> following, about the time of Fi&s;hing, to his Parents, and &s;everal Per&s;ons had Copies thereof, and for ought I know, &s;ome retain them to this very Day; &s;ure I am, that many remember the Particulars of this Sur|prizing Affair, who are now living in that I&s;land.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame odd Variety of Accident which put it out of my Power to be Per&s;onally pre&s;ent with you for &s;o long a time, put it likewi&s;e out of my Power to write to you. At la&s;t Fortune has &s;o ordered it, that I can &s;end a Letter to you, before I can come my &s;elf, and it is written Expre&s;ly to tell you the Adventures I have met with, which haved etained me this tedious Space of Time, from my Dear Father, and becau&s;e the &s;ame Captain of a Ship that brings you this, might as ea&s;ily have brought your Son to &s;peak for him&s;elf.

&s;ingular Marks of Paternal Affection, that I know your Receipt of this Letter will fill your Heart with Joy, and Cau&s;e you to Sign me an Ab&s;olution and free Pardon for all the Errors I have Committed, and think the Sufferings, I have undergone for my Ra&s;hne&s;s and Indi&s;cretion, a &s;ufficient Attone|ment for my Crime of making you by my Undutifulne&s;s a Partner of my Sorrows. To free you the more from this unea&s;ine&s;s, I know I need only tell you, that every Grief of mine is gone excepting one, which is, that I mu&s;t &s;till lo&s;e the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you a little longer.

The fir&s;t Providential Glimp&s;e of the Morning gave me a view of a Ship driven by the Tem|pe&s;t into a Creek of the Rock, that was by Nature formed like a Harbour; a Miraculous Security of Deliverance as I thought, both for the Ships Crew and my &s;elf: I made all the ha&s;te I could, you may be &s;ure to them, and I found them to be <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> that were come for Fi&s;h, but in lieu of Fi&s;h I in&s;tru|cted them to Load it with Eggs and Fowl, which we compa&s;&s;ed very happily in a &s;hort

Space of Time, and I was to be a Sharer with the Captain in the Lading, and Bar|gained to go for <HI>Holland,</HI> to &s;ee the Sale, and the Nature of Traffick, but when we were at Sea, after much bad weather we made to|wards <HI>Zealand,</HI> but we were driven upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Finland,</HI> by a new Storm, and thence into <HI>Lapland,</HI> where I now am, and from whence I &s;end you this Letter.</P>
<P>I could not come into a place &s;o properly named for my Reception: As I had been Undutiful to you, and Fortune &s;eemed to make me an Exile, or a Bani&s;hed Man, by way of Puni&s;hment for the Vices of my Youth; &s;o <HI>Lapland</HI> (which is a Word origi|ginally derived from the <HI>Finland</HI> Word <HI>Lappi,</HI> that is Exiles, and from the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Lap,</HI> &s;ignifying Bani&s;hed, from which two Kingdoms mo&s;t of our Inhabitants were Ba|ni&s;hed hither, for not embracing the Chri|&s;tian Religion) was certainly the propere&s;t Country in the World to receive Me.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t I entered this Country, I thought I was got into quite another World: The Men are all of them Pigmies to our Tall Brawny <HI>Highlanders;</HI> they are generally &s;peaking, not above Three Cubits high, in|&s;omuch that tho' the whole Country of <HI>Lap|land</HI> is immen&s;ly large, and I have heard it reckoned by the Inhabitants, to be above a Hundted <HI>German</HI> Leagues in Length, and Four&s;core and Ten in Breadth: Yet I was

the Talle&s;t Man there, and looked upon as a Giant.

As &s;he was beyond mea&s;ure Beautiful, &s;he was extreamly good humoured (a thing rarely to be met among <HI>Lapland</HI> Women) of a better Stature than her Country Women, and very Rich, and of good Birth; I thought
<PB N="20" REF="44">
it would be a prodigious Turn of Fortune, for a Man in my Circum&s;tances, if I could make any Progre&s;s in her Heart, which &s;he &s;eemed a little to open to me, in &s;uch a man|ner, for the beginning, as if &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;sful Event, if managed with Prudence, might not be de&s;paired off. Souls that are Gene|rous are apt to Love, and Compa&s;&s;ion is the be&s;t introducer of Love into a Generous Bo|&s;om, and that was the be&s;t Stock I had, to go upon in my Court&s;hip: I told her of all my Calamities, my Dangers, and my E&s;capes; the Goodne&s;s of my Birth, as being Allied to one of the Greate&s;t Nobles in our I&s;land; and &s;till &s;he would ask me to tell it her over again, tho' every time I told it, ju&s;t at &s;uch and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;he was forced to drop the Tears from her Eyes. In fine I grew more in Love with her, out of a Sen&s;e of Gratitude now, than by the Power of her Charms be|fore: The matter in a few Days, went &s;o far, that &s;he owned to me, I had her Heart. As to Marriage, I did not then know the Cu|&s;tom of the Nation; I thought that if it proved only Dangerous to me, I loved her &s;o well, that I intended to Marry her, tho' the Law was to Pronounce me Dead for it; but I did not know whether it might not be Peri|lous for her too, to Engage in &s;uch a State with me, and I re&s;olved in that Ca&s;e, rather to be &s;ingly unhappy, than to involve her in Di&s;tre&s;s, and make her the fair Companion
<PB N="21" REF="45">
of my Woes. I would not tell her &s;o, for fear &s;he &s;hould out of Love hide from me tho&s;e Dangers, and therefore u&s;ing a kind &s;ort of Di&s;&s;imulation, I conjured her to tell me the Laws and Cu&s;toms of Marriages in that Country, to a tittle, and that nothing &s;hould hinder us from Happine&s;s. She told me exactly, as I find &s;ince. Our Marriage &s;aid &s;he, will be very hard to Compa&s;s; provi|ded we follow the &s;trict Rule of the Coun|try. For our Women here, are bound not to &s;ee the Man, who makes their Addre&s;&s;es to them, in &s;ome time. His way of Court&s;hip, is to come to the Parents, and his neare&s;t Friends and Relations mu&s;t make her Father Pre&s;ents, and Supplicate him like a King, to Grant him his Daughter. The Court&s;hip often la&s;ts two or three Years, and &s;ometimes has not its Effect at la&s;t: But if it has, the Woman is dragged by her Father and Bro|ther to Church, as unwilling to go to be Mar|ried, which is looked upon as a greater part of Mode&s;ty in her, according to the greater Di&s;inclination &s;he &s;hews. My Father and Brother, &s;aid &s;he, will both be again&s;t it: You have no Relations in this Country to move your Suit, I cannot be &s;o Hypocritical, as to be dragged unwillingly to him I own I de|&s;ire for my Lawful Husband, and therefore as I have an Inclination to you, and I dare own I have, I will not follow tho&s;e methods, which I di&s;approve. I have talked with &s;e|veral
<PB N="22" REF="46">
<HI>Swedes,</HI> and &s;everal Polite <HI>Frenchmen</HI> about their Manner of E&s;pou&s;als, and I am told, that when Souls are naturally united by Affection, the Couple &s;o mutually and reciprocally Loving, tho' they had rather have their Parents leave if likely to be got, yet unwilling to be di&s;appointed, only go to the next Mini&s;ter's and Marry for better for wor&s;e. This way I approve of, for where two Per&s;ons naturally love each other, the re&s;t is nothing but a mode&s;t re&s;traint to their Wi&s;hes, and &s;ince 'tis only Cu&s;tom, my own Rea&s;on teaches me, there is no Error Com|mitted, nor any harm done in breaking thro' it, upon &s;o commendable an Occa&s;ion. I have, added &s;he, a Thou&s;and Rain-Deer be|longing to me, beyond my Father's Power of taking away, and a Third &s;hare in a Rekar or Clan, that is ten Leagues in Com|pa&s;s, in the Byar or Canton of <HI>Uma Lap|mark.</HI> This is at my own Di&s;po&s;al, and it is all your own, if you plea&s;e to accept of it with me. Our Women are very coy, when they are Courted, tho' they have never &s;o much an Inclination to their Suitor: but good Rea&s;on and the Commerce I have had with Per&s;ons of Politer Nations, than ours is, teach me that this proceeds entirely from Vanity and Affectation, and the greate&s;t Proof of a Women's Mode&s;ty, Cha&s;tity, and Sincerity certainly con&s;i&s;ts (contrary to the general corrupted opinion) in yielding up
<PB N="23" REF="47">
her &s;elf &s;oon into the Arms of the Man &s;he Loves. For &s;he that can dally with a Heart &s;he prizes, can give away her Heart (when &s;he is once baulked) to any Man, even tho' &s;he di&s;likes him. You mu&s;t Judge (my Dear Father) I mu&s;t be touched with a Woman that was exceeding Beautiful, beyond any of her Nation, and who had Thoughts as Beautiful as her Per&s;on. I therefore was all in Rapture, and longed for the Matrimony, but &s;till loved her enough to propo&s;e the Que&s;tion, I re&s;olved to her, <HI>viz.</HI> If it would not be in her Nation accounted a Clande&s;tine Marriage, and prove of great Damage to her.</P>
<P>To this &s;he an&s;wered, with all the Wi&s;dom which could be expected from a Woman, who had given &s;uch Eminent Tokens of her Judg|ment on other points, amid&s;t a Nation &s;o Bar|barous in its Manners, and &s;o Corrupt in its Principles, as <HI>Lapland</HI> is. I am, &s;aid &s;he, an&s;wer|able to my Father, for nothing by our Laws, having no Portion of him, but only what was pre&s;ented me by my Relations, at my Birth, according to Cu&s;tom, in Lands and Rain-Deer. My Father is but Deputy Governor, 'tis a <HI>Swede</HI> who is the Governor of <HI>Uma,</HI> and if I pay to him at every Mart and Fair the due Tribute which mu&s;t either con&s;i&s;t of Fifty Rain-Deer, or one hundred and fifty Rixdollars, he will have the Prie&s;t that Mar|ry's us pre&s;ent at the Court of Ju&s;tice, accord|ing
<PB N="24" REF="48">
to our Cu&s;tom, and keep us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Rights, that we may be enabled to pay Tribute to the Crown of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In|deed, before the Abolition of the <HI>Birkarti,</HI> which were our Native Judges, we could not have Married thus without Danger to us both; but now there is none at all.</P>
<P><HI>My Dear Father,</HI> You mu&s;t ea&s;ily imagin that I could not help embracing with all tenderne&s;s &s;o dear and &s;o lovely a Woman. In fine, I am Married to her, I have lived very happily hitherto, and am now grown more happy, for &s;he is big with Child; and like, before my Letter comes to your Hands, to make you a Grandfather of a pretty Boy. You will perhaps wonder, that I name the Sex of the Child, before it comes into the World; But we have a way in <HI>Lapland</HI> of finding that out, which tho' &s;ome Judicious People call Super&s;titious, I am really per|&s;waded of by Experience, and therefore I in|dulged my dear Wife's curio&s;ity, when &s;he &s;ignified to me, &s;he had a Mind to make the u&s;ual Tryal, whether the Child &s;he was going to be Delivered of, would be a Boy or a Girl.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t under&s;tand (<HI>My Dear Father</HI>) the People here Judge of the Sex of the Child by the Moon, unto which they compare a Big-bellied Woman. If they &s;ee a Star appear ju&s;t above the Moon, it is a &s;ign it will be a Boy, but, if the Star be ju&s;t below the Moon, they con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ecture her to be big with a Girl,
<PB N="25" REF="49">
This Ob&s;ervation and Remark of <HI>Laplan|ders</HI> has (I know) been accounted by &s;ome, and tho&s;e Wi&s;e and Judicious Men too, to be ridiculou&s;ly Super&s;titious; but I have been led into an ea&s;ie belief of this My&s;tery, by a Mi&s;tre&s;s (that is Superior to Wi&s;dom it &s;elf) Con&s;tant, and therefore probably Infallible, Experience. I therefore indulged my Wife in this her reque&s;t, and went with her to the Ceremony; the Star appeared above the Moon, which Progno&s;ticates a Boy, which I wi&s;h may, and I &s;carce doubt will prove true, and when &s;he is brought to Bed, I will &s;end you word of it. It is remarkable likewi&s;e, that a Star was &s;een ju&s;t before the Moon, which we al&s;o count a very good Omen. For it is a cu&s;tom likewi&s;e here in <HI>Lapland,</HI> to con&s;ult the Moon, as an Oracle about the Health and Vigour of the Child. If a Star be &s;een ju&s;t before the Moon, we count it a &s;ign of a lu&s;ty and well grown Child, without Blemi&s;h; if a Star comes ju&s;t after, we reckon it a token that the Child will have &s;ome defect or deformity, or die &s;oon after it is Born.</P>
<P>Having thus told you the Manners of the Country I live in at pre&s;ent, as much at large as the &s;pace of a Letter will permit, and rela|ted to you my own happy Circum&s;tances, and the kindly Promi&s;es of the Heavens, that are U&s;hering in the Birth of my Child, I would not have you think that I addict my

I have on the Contrary, &s;ince I Married her, endeavoured to repay my Wife's Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings to me with tho&s;e that are endle&s;s, in&s;tructed her in all the Points of Religion, and made her perfectly a Chri&s;tian; and &s;he by her Devotion and Prayers for me, makes me &s;uch amends for it, that I hope in us two St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s &s;aying will be verified, <HI>viz. That the Woman &s;hall be &s;anctified in her Husband, and the Husband &s;hall be &s;anctified in his Wife.</HI></P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t take notice in this Place, with all due deference to Chri&s;tianity, that tho' I am obliged to applaud the Prudence and Piety of <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who Con&s;tituting <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Governors over this Country, Abrogated their Practi&s;e of Super|&s;titions, and Art Magick upon pain of Death; Yet that King carried the point too far, and in|termingled with the&s;e Arts, the preten&s;ions to the gift of a &s;econd &s;ight, which you know how frequent it is with us in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which I a&s;&s;ure you, my Wife (tho' &s;he dur&s;t not Publickly own it, for fear of incurring the penalty of tho&s;e <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Laws) does as it were inherit (for all her Ance&s;tors, before her, have had it from time Immemorial) to

<P>I Am now the happie&s;t Man alive; the Pro&s;perous part of my Wife's Predicti|ons, which I mentioned to you in my la&s;t, is come in &s;ome mea&s;ure to pa&s;s. The Child &s;he has brought me proves a Boy, and as fine a one, as I ever beheld, (if fondne&s;s for my own makes me not blind) And &s;ure it can't be fondne&s;s, becau&s;e other plain Cir|cum&s;tances joined at his birth, to prove it a more than ordinary Remarkable one. He was born with a Cawl upon his Head, which we count one of the Luckie&s;t Signs, that can be in Nature; he had likewi&s;e three Teeth ready Cut thro' the Gums, and we reckon that an undeniable Te&s;ti|mony and Promi&s;e given to the World by Nature, that &s;he intends &s;uch a Per&s;on for her extraordinary Favourite, and that he is born for great Things, which I dai|ly beg of Heaven, may come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Since I have known for &s;ome Months, what it is to be a Father, it adds a Con|&s;iderable weight to tho&s;e Affections which I had for my Wife.

act upon the Stage of Life. I find that I did love her then as well as a Husband could love a Wife (that is) a Wife without a Child, but the love to a Wife that has a Child, is a feeling wonderful and inexpre&s;&s;ibly different. A Child is the Seal and the Pledge of Love, Meditating upon this, has likewi&s;e doubled my Affection to you; I loved you before as a Son, and becau&s;e as &s;uch, I felt your Tender|ne&s;s; but my Love is much increa&s;ed now, becau&s;e I know the tenderne&s;s which you felt for me as a Father: With the&s;e plea&s;ing images of thought, I often keep you nearer company at this va&s;t di&s;tance, than when I lived irregularly under your Eye. The&s;e re|flexions render a Solitary Life dear to me. And tho' I have no manner of Acquaintance with her Relations, who hate me as I am told, nor indeed with almo&s;t any of the In|habitants, but my own Dome&s;ticks, and tho&s;e I am forced to deal with, yet I have as much methinks, as I wi&s;h for, unle&s;s I could come over to <HI>Schetland,</HI> and live with you, which I the more ardently de&s;ire; becau&s;e I think I and my Wife could be true com|forts to you, in your advanced Years; now I know what living truly is. I am daily per|&s;wading my Wife to go with me; but &s;he denies me with kind Expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ays, &s;he owes too much to the Place (however le&s;s plea&s;ant in it &s;elf than other Climates) where &s;he had the happine&s;s of fir&s;t joining

<HEAD>CHAP. II. After the Death of Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell's</HI> Mother in <HI>Lapland.</HI> His Father <HI>Archibald</HI> returned with his Son to <HI>Scotland.</HI> His Se|cond Marriage, and how his Son was taught to Write and Read.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Archibald Campbell,</HI> having bu|ried his <HI>Lapland</HI> Lady, returned to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and brought over with him his Son Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell:</HI> By that time he had been a Year in his own Country, he Married a Second Wife; a Lady whom I had known very well, for &s;ome Years, and then I fir&s;t &s;aw the Boy, but as they went into the We&s;tern I&s;lands, I &s;aw them not again in three Years. She being quite contrary to the cruel way much in U&s;e among Step-Mothers, very fond of the Boy, was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay, &s;he did, and would always think him her own Son. The Child came to be about four Years of Age (as &s;he has related to me the Story &s;ince) and not able to &s;peak one Word, nor to hear any noi&s;e; the Fa|ther of him u&s;ed to be mightily oppre&s;&s;ed with Grief, and complain heavily to his new Wife, who was no le&s;s perplexed that a Boy &s;o pretty, the Son of &s;o particular a Woman, which he had made his Wife, by &s;trange Ac|cidents and Adventures, and a Child coming
<PB N="33" REF="57">
into the World with &s;o many amazing Cir|cum&s;tances attending his Birth, &s;hould lo&s;e tho&s;e precious Sen&s;es, by which alone the &s;oci|al Commerce of Mankind is upheld and maintained, and that he &s;hould be deprived of all Advantages of Education, which could rai&s;e him to the Character of being the great Man, that &s;o many concurring incidents at his Nativity promi&s;ed and betokened, he would be.</P>
<P>One day a Learned Divine, who was of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> but had vi&s;ited <HI>Oxford,</HI> and been acquainted with the chief Men of Science there, happening to be in conver&s;ation with the Mother in Law of this Child, &s;he related to him her Son's Misfor|tunes, with &s;o many Marks of Sorrow, that, &s;he moved the good old Gentleman's Compa&s;|&s;ion, and excited in him a de&s;ire, to give her what Relief and Con&s;olation he could, in this unhappy ca&s;e. His particular inclination to do her good Offices, made him reccollect, that at the time he was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he had been in Company with one Doctor <HI>Wallis,</HI> a Man famous for Learning, who had told him, that he had taught a (born Deaf and Dumb) Man to Write, and to Read, and even to utter &s;ome &s;ounds articulately with his Mouth; and, that he told him, he was then going to Commit to Print the Method he made u&s;e of, in &s;o In&s;tructing that Per&s;on, that others, in the like unfortunate Condition,
<PB N="34" REF="58">
might receive the &s;ame Benefits and Advan|tages from other Ma&s;ters, which his Deaf and Dumb Pupil had received from him. A Dumb Man recovering his Speech, or a Blind Man gaining his Sight, or a Deaf one getting his Hearing, could not be more o|verjoyed, than Mrs. <HI>Campbell</HI> was at the&s;e unexpected Tidings, and &s;he wept for Glad|ne&s;s, when he told it. The Good Gentle|man Animated and Encouraged her with the kinde&s;t Promi&s;es, and to keep alive her hopes, a&s;&s;ured her he would &s;end to one of the chief Book&s;ellers in <HI>London,</HI> to enquire after the Book, who would certainly procure it him, if it was to be got, and that after|wards he would peru&s;e it diligently, make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of Doctor <HI>Wallis</HI> his Method, and tho' he had many great Works upon his Hands at that time, he would &s;teal from his other Studies lei&s;ure enough to compleat &s;o Charitable an Office, as teaching the Dumb and Deaf to Read, and to Write, and give her Son, who was by <HI>Nature</HI> Deprived of them, the Advantages of Speech, as far as <HI>Art</HI> would permit that <HI>Natural</HI> Defect to be &s;upplied by her Powerful Inter|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>When the Mother came Home, the Child, who could hear no knocking, and therefore it mu&s;t be by a &s;trange and inexplicable in|&s;tinct in Nature, was the fir&s;t, that ran to the Door, and falling in a great fit of Laugh|ter
<PB N="35" REF="59">
(a thing it was not much u&s;ed to before, having on the contrary rather a Melanchol|ly ca&s;t of Complexion) it clung round its Mother's Knees, ince&s;&s;antly embracing and ki&s;&s;ing them, as if ju&s;t at that time it had an in&s;ight, into what the Mother had been do|ing for it, and into its own Approaching Re|lief from its Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>When the Mother came with the Child in her hand to the Father, to tell him the wel|come News; the Child bur&s;t afre&s;h into a great fit of Laughter, which continued for an unu&s;ual &s;pace of time; and the &s;cene of &s;uch reciprocal Affection and Joy between a Wife and her own Husband, on &s;o &s;ignal an occa&s;ion, is a thing, ea&s;ier to be felt by Pa|rents of a good Di&s;po&s;ition, imagining them|&s;elves under the &s;ame Circum&s;tance, with re|gard to a Child they loved with fondne&s;s, than to be expre&s;&s;ed or de&s;cribed by the Pen of any Writer. But it is certain, whenever they &s;poke of this Affair, as any Body, who knows the impatience of Parents for the Welfare of an only Child, may gue&s;s they mu&s;t be often Di&s;cour&s;ing it over, and wi&s;h|ing the time was come; the Boy, who u&s;ed &s;eldom &s;o much as to &s;mile at other times, and who could never hear the greate&s;t noi&s;e that could be made, would con&s;tantly look wi&s;hfully in their Faces, and laugh immode|rately, which is a plain Indication, that there was then a wonderful In&s;tinct in Na|ture
<PB N="36" REF="60">
as I &s;aid before, which made him fore|ta&s;te his good Fortune, and, if I may be al|lowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, The Dawnings as it were of the Second &s;ight, were then Preg|nant within him.</P>
<P>To confirm this, the happy hour of his Deliverance being come; and the Doctor having procured Mr. <HI>Wallis</HI>'s Book, came with great Joy, and de&s;ired to &s;ee his Pupil; &s;carce were the Words out of his Mouth, when the Child happened to come into the Room, and running towards the Doctor, fell on his Knees, ki&s;&s;ed his Hand eagerly, and Laughed as before, which to me, is a Demon&s;tration, that he had an in&s;ight into the Good, which the Doctor intended him.</P>
<P>It is certain, that &s;everal Learned Men, who have written concerning the <HI>Second &s;ight,</HI> have Demon&s;trated by unconte&s;table Proofs, and undeniable Arguments, that Children, nay, even Hor&s;es and Cows, &s;ee the <HI>Second &s;ight,</HI> as well as Men and Women advanced in Years. But of this, I &s;hall Di&s;cour&s;e at large, in its proper Place, having allotted a whole future Chapter for that &s;ame Subject of Second &s;ightedne&s;s.</P>
<P>In about half a Year, the Doctor taught his little Dumb Pupil, Fir&s;t, to know his Letters, then to name any thing what&s;oever, to leave off &s;ome Savage Motions, which he had taken of his own accord, before to &s;ig|nifie his Mind by, and to impart his
<PB N="37" REF="61">
Thoughts by his Fingers and his Pen, in a Manner as intelligible, and almo&s;t as &s;wift thro' the Eyes, as that is of conveying our Ideas to one another, by our Voices thro' the Condites and Portholes of the Ears. But in little more than two Years, he could Write and Read, as well as any Body, be|cau&s;e a great many People cannot conceive this; and others pretend it is not to be done in Nature: I will a little Di&s;cour&s;e upon Doctor <HI>Wallis</HI>'s Foundation, and &s;hew in a Manner obvious to the mo&s;t ignorant; how this hitherto, Mi&s;terious help, may be ea&s;ily Admini&s;tred to the Deaf, and the Dumb, which &s;hall be the Subject of the en&s;uing Chapter.</P>
<P>But I cannot Conclude this, without tel|ling the hand&s;ome &s;aying, with which this Child, when not quite Six Years old, as &s;oon as he thought he could expre&s;s him&s;elf well, payed his fir&s;t Acknowledgment to his Ma|&s;ter, and which Promi&s;ed, how great his fu|ture Genius was to be, when &s;o Witty a Child ripened into Man. The Words, he wrote to him, were the&s;e, only altered into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from the <HI>Scotch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir, It is no little Work, you have Ac|compli&s;hed, My Thanks are too poor amends: The World, Sir, &s;hall give you Thanks; for as I could not have expre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf without your Teaching me, &s;o, tho&s;e that can talk, tho' they have Eyes, cannot &s;ee the Things,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Method of Teaching <HI>Deaf</HI> and <HI>Dumb</HI> Per&s;ons to Write, Read, and under&s;tand a Language.</HEAD>
<P>IT is, I mu&s;t con&s;e&s;s, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure amazing to me, that Men, of any Mo|derate Share of Learning, &s;hould not natu|rally conceive of them&s;elves, a plain Rea&s;on for this Art, and know how to Account for the Practicability of it, the Moment they hear the Propo&s;ition advanced, the Rea&s;ons for it, are &s;o obvious to the very fir&s;t Con|&s;ideration we can make about it. It will be likewi&s;e as amazing to me, that the mo&s;t ignorant &s;hould not conceive it, after &s;o plain a Rea&s;on is given them for it, as I am now going to &s;et down.</P>
<P>To begin: How are Children at fir&s;t taught a Language that can hear? Are they not taught by Sounds? And what are tho&s;e Sounds, but Token, and Signs to the Ear, importing and &s;ignifying &s;uch and &s;uch a Thing? If then, there can be Signs made to the Eye, agreed by the Party teach|ing
<PB REF="63">

<PB N="39" REF="64">
the Child, that they &s;ignifie &s;uch and &s;uch a Thing, will not the Eye of the Child con|vey them to the Mind, as well as the Ear? They are indeed different Marks to different Sen&s;es, but both the one and the other do e|qually &s;ignifie the &s;ame Things or Notions, according to the Will of the Teacher, and con&s;equently, mu&s;t have an equal Effect with the Per&s;on, who is to be in&s;tructed: For tho' the Manners &s;ignifying are different, the Things &s;ignified are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>For Example; If, after having invented an Alphabet upon the Fingers, a Ma&s;ter always keeps Company with a Deaf Child, and teaches it to call for what&s;oever it wants, by &s;uch Motions of the Fingers, which if put down by Letters, according to each invented Mo|tion of each Finger, would form in writing a Word of a Thing, which it wanted; might not he by the&s;e regular Motions teach it's Eye the &s;ame Notions of Things, as Sounds do to the Ears of Children that Hear: The Manner of Teaching the Alphabet by Fin|gers, is plainly &s;et down in the following Table.</P>
<P>When the Deaf Child has Learn't by the&s;e Motions a good Stock of Words, as Chil|dren that hear fir&s;t learn by Sounds, we may methinks call not improperly, the Fin|gers of &s;uch a Dumb Infant, its <HI>Mouth,</HI> and the Eye of &s;uch a Deaf Child, its <HI>Ear.</HI> When he has learnt thus far, he mu&s;t be taught to
<PB N="40" REF="65">
Write the Alphabet, according as it was A|dapted to the Motions of his Fingers: As for In&s;tance, the five Vowels, <HI>a, e, i, o, u,</HI> by pointing to the top of the five Fingers, and the other Letters, <HI>b, c, d, &amp;c.</HI> by &s;uch o|ther Place or Po&s;ture of a Finger, as in the above-mentioned Table is &s;et forth, or other|wi&s;e, as &s;hall be agreed upon. When this is done the Marks B, R, E, A, D, (and &s;o of all other Words) Corre&s;ponding with &s;uch Fin|gers, conveys thro' his Eyes, unto his Head the &s;ame Notion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Thing &s;ignified, as the Sound we give to tho&s;e &s;ame Letters, making the Word <HI>Bread,</HI> do into our Heads thro' the Ears.</P>
<P>This once done, he may be ea&s;ily taught to under&s;tand the Parts of Speech, as the <HI>Verb,</HI> the <HI>Noun, Pronoun,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o by Rules of <HI>Grammar</HI> and <HI>Syntax,</HI> to compound Ideas, and connect his Words into a Lan|guage. The Method of which, &s;ince it is plainly &s;et forth in Doctor <HI>Wallis</HI>'s Letter to Mr. <HI>Beverly.</HI> I &s;hall &s;et it down by way of Extract; that People in the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances with the Per&s;on we treat of, and of the like Genius, may not have their Talents lo&s;t, for want of the like A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When once a Deaf Per&s;on has learn't &s;o far, as to under&s;tand the common Di&s;cour&s;e of others, and to expre&s;s his Mind (tolerably well in Writing) I &s;ee no room to doubt, but that (provided Nature has endowed him with
<PB N="41" REF="66">
a proper Strength of Genius, as other Men that hear) he may become capable (upon fur|ther Improvement) of &s;uch further Know|ledge as is attainable by Reading. For I mu&s;t here join with the Learned Doctor <HI>Wallis,</HI> in a&s;&s;erting (as to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e before us) that no Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why &s;uch a Deaf Per&s;on may not attain the under&s;tanding of a Language as <HI>perfectly</HI> as tho&s;e that hear; and with the &s;ame Learned Author, I take upon me to lay down this Propo&s;ition, as certain, that allowing the Deaf Per&s;on the like Time and Exerci&s;e, as to other Men is requi&s;ite in order to attain the Perfection of a Language, and the Ele|gance of it, he may under&s;tand as well, and Write as good Language as other Men, and abating only what doth depend upon Sound, as Tones, Cadencies, and &s;uch Punctilio's; no whit inferior to what he may attain to, if he had his hearing as others have?</P>

<HEAD>An Extract from Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> concerning the Method of Teaching the <HI>Deaf</HI> and <HI>Dumb</HI> to Read.</HEAD>
<P>IT is mo&s;t Natural (as Children learn the Names of Things) to furni&s;h him (by Degrees) with a <HI>Nomenclator,</HI> containing a Competent Number of Names of Things common and obvious to the Eye (that you may &s;hew the Thing an&s;wering to &s;uch a

<P>And under each of the&s;e, as di&s;tinct Heads, the Furniture or Men&s;ils belonging thereun|to; with Divi&s;ions and Subdivi&s;ions, as there is occa&s;ion, which I forbear to Menti|on, that I be not too Prolix.</P>
<P>And in like manner, from Time to Time, may be added more Collections, or Clau&s;es of Names or Words, conveniently dige&s;ted, under di&s;tinct Heads, and &s;uitable Di&s;tribu|tions; to be written in di&s;tinct Leaves or Pages of his Book, in &s;uch Order, as may &s;eem convenient.</P>
<P>When he is furni&s;hed with a Competent Number of Names, though not &s;o many as I have mentioned: It will be &s;ea&s;onable to teach him, under the Titles Singular and
<PB N="45" REF="70">
Plural. The Formation of Plurals from Sin|gulars; by adding S or Es. As Hand Hands, Face Faces, Fi&s;h Fi&s;hes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with &s;ome few irregulars, as Man Men, Woman Wo|men, Foot Feet, Tooth Teeth, Mou&s;e Mice, Low&s;e Lice, Ox Oxen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Which, except the irregulars, will &s;erve for Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ives, to be afrer taught him, which are formed by their Primitives by like Addition of S or Es, except &s;ome few irregulars, as My Mine, Thy Thine, Our Ours, Your Yours, His, Her, Hers, Their Theirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in all tho&s;e, and other like Ca&s;es, it will be proper fir&s;t, to &s;hew him the Parti|culars, and then the General Title.</P>
<P>Then teach him in another Page or Paper, the Particulars, a, an, the, this, that, the&s;e, tho&s;e.</P>
<P>And the Pronouns, I, me, my, mine, thou, thee, thy, thine, we, us, ourours, ye, you, your, yours, he, him, his, &s;he, her, hers, it, it's, they, them, their, theirs, who, whom, who's.</P>
<P>Then under the Titles <HI>Sub&s;tantive Adje|ctive,</HI> teach him to Connect the&s;e, as my Hand, your Head, his Foot, his Feet, her Arm, Arms, our Hats, their Shoes, <HI>John</HI>'s Coat, <HI>William</HI>'s Band, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in Order to furni&s;h him with more Adjectives, under the Title <HI>Colours,</HI> you may place, black, white, gray, green, blue, yellow, red, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and having &s;hewed the particulars, let him know that the&s;e are
<PB N="46" REF="71">
called Colours. The like for ta&s;te and &s;mell, as &s;weet, bitter, &s;oure, &s;tink.</P>
<P>And for Hearing: &s;ound, noi&s;e, word.</P>
<P>Then for touch or feeling: hot, warm, cold, cool, wet, moi&s;t, dry, hard, &s;oft, tough, brittle, heavy, light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From whence you may furni&s;h him with more Examples of Adjectives with Sub&s;tan|tives; as, white Bread, brown Bread, green Gra&s;s, &s;oft Chee&s;e, hard Chee&s;e, black Hat, my black Hat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And then inverting the Order, Sub&s;tantive, Adjective, with the Verb Copulative between. As, Silver is white, Gold is yellow, Lead is heavy, Wood is light, Snow is white, Ink is black, Fle&s;h is &s;oft, Bone is hard, I am &s;ick, I am not well, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which will begin to give him &s;ome Notion of <HI>Syntax.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, when Sub&s;tantive and Sub&s;tantive are &s;o connected; as Gold is a Metal, a Ro&s;e is a Flower, they are Men, they are Women, Hor&s;es are Bea&s;ts, Gee&s;e are Fowls, Larks are Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then as tho&s;e before relate to Quality, you may give him &s;ome other Words relating to Quantity. As long, &s;hort, broad, narrow; thick, thin; high, tall, low; deep, &s;hallow, great, big, &s;mall (little) much, little; many, few, full, empty; whole, part, piece; all, &s;ome, none, &s;trong, weak, quick, &s;low, equal, nnequal, bigger, le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="72">
Then words of figure: As &s;treight, crook|ed, plain, bowed, concave, hollow, convex; round, &s;quare, three-&s;quare, &s;phere, globe, bowl, cube, die, upright, &s;loping, leaning forward, leaning backward, like, unlike.</P>
<P>Of Ge&s;ture; as &s;tand, lie, &s;it, kneel, &s;leep.</P>
<P>Of Motion; as move, &s;tir, re&s;t, walk, go, come, run, leap, ride, fall, ri&s;e, &s;wim, &s;ink, drawn, &s;lide, creep, crawl, fly, pull, draw, thru&s;t, throw, bring, fetch, carry.</P>
<P>Then Words relating to Time; place, number, weight, mea&s;ure, money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are in convenient time, to be &s;hewed him di|&s;tinctly; for which the teacher according to his Di&s;cretion, may take a convenient Sea|&s;on.</P>
<P>As likewi&s;e the Time of the Day; the Days of the Week, the Days of the Month, the Months of the Year; and other Things relating to the <HI>Almanack,</HI> which he will quickly be capable to under&s;tand, if once Methodically &s;hewn him.</P>
<P>As likewi&s;e the Names, and Situation of Places, and Countries, which are conveni|ent for him to know; which may be order|ly written in his Book, and &s;hewed him in the Map of <HI>London, England, Europe,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the&s;e may be done at lei&s;ure, as like|wi&s;e the practice of Arithmetick, and other like Pieces of Learning.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="73">
In the mean time, after the Concord of Sub&s;tantive and Adjective, he is to be &s;hew|ed by convenient Examples, that of the <HI>No|minative</HI> and <HI>Verb.</HI> As for In&s;tance: I go, you &s;ee, he &s;its, they &s;tand, the fire burns, the &s;un &s;hines, the wind blows, the rain falls, the water runs; and the like, with the Titles in the top Nominative Verb.</P>
<P>After this, (under the Titles Nominative Verb, Accu&s;ative) give him Examples of Verbs Tran&s;itive; as I &s;ee you, you &s;ee me, the fire burns the wood, the Boy makes the fire, the Cook roa&s;ts the meat, the Butler lays the cloath, we eat our dinner.</P>
<P>Or even with a double Accu&s;ative; as you teach me writing or to write, <HI>John</HI> teacheth me to Dance, <HI>Thomas</HI> tells me a Tale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After this, you may teach him the Flexi|on or Comugation of the Verb, or what is Equivalent thereunto; for in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, each Verb hath but two Ten&s;es, the Pre&s;ent and the Preter, two Participles, the Active and the Pa&s;&s;ive, all the re&s;t is perfor|med by Auxiliaries, which Auxiliaries have no more Ten&s;es than the other Verbs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Auxiliaries are, do, did, will, would, &s;hall, &s;hould, may, might, can, could, mu&s;t, ought, to, have, had, am, be, was. And if by Examples you can in&s;inuate the Significa|tation of the&s;e few Words, you have taught him the whole Flexion of the Verb.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="74">
And here it will be convenient, once for all, to write him out a full Paradigm of &s;ome one Verb, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>to &s;ee,</HI> through all tho&s;e Auxiliaries.</P>
<P>The Verb it&s;elf, hath but the&s;e four Words to be Learned, &s;ee, &s;aw, &s;eeing, &s;een, &s;ave that after thou, in the &s;econd Per&s;on Singular, in both Ten&s;es, we add <HI>e&s;t,</HI> and in the Third Per&s;on Singular, in the Pre&s;ent Ten&s;e <HI>eth</HI> or <HI>es,</HI> or in&s;tead thereof, <HI>&s;t, th, s,</HI> and &s;o in all Verbs.</P>
<P>Then to the Auxiliaries, do did, will would, &s;hall &s;hould, may might, can could, mu&s;t ought to, we join the Indefinite &s;ee. And after have, had, am, be, was, the Pa&s;&s;ive Par|ticle &s;een, and &s;o for all other Verbs.</P>
<P>But the Auxiliary <HI>Am</HI> or <HI>Be,</HI> is &s;omewhat irregular in a double Form.</P>
<P>Am art is: Plural are, was wa&s;t was, Plural were.</P>
<P>Be bee&s;t be: Plural be, were wert were, Plural were.</P>
<P>Be, am, was, being, been.</P>
<P>Which, attended with the other Auxilia|ries, make us the whole Pa&s;&s;ive Voice.</P>
<P>All Verbs, without Exceptions, in the Active Participle are formed by adding <HI>ing,</HI> as &s;ee &s;eeing, teach teaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Preter Ten&s;e, and the Participle are formed regularly, by adding <HI>ed,</HI> but are oft &s;ubject to Contractions, and other irregula|rities, &s;ometime the &s;ame in both, &s;ometime
<PB N="50" REF="75">
different, and therefore it is convenient here to give a Table of Verbs, e&s;pecially, the mo&s;t u&s;ual, for tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> Ca&s;es, which may at once teach their Signification and Formati|on; as boil boiled, ro&s;t ro&s;ted ro&s;ted, bake baked baked, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> teach taught taught, bring brought brought, buy bought bought, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ee &s;aw &s;een, give gave given, take took taken, for&s;ake for&s;ooke for&s;aken, write wrote written, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with many more fit to be Learned.</P>
<P>The Verbs being thus di&s;patched, he is then to learn the Prepo&s;itions; wherein lies the whole Regimen of the Noun. For Diver&s;ity of Ca&s;es we have none, the force of which is to be in&s;inuated by convenient Ex|amples, &s;uited to their different Significati|ons. As for In&s;tance, Of, a piece <HI>of</HI> Bread, a pint <HI>of</HI> Wine, the colour <HI>of</HI> a Pot, the colour <HI>of</HI> Gold, a ring <HI>of</HI> Gold, a cup <HI>of</HI> Silver, the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> the longe&s;t <HI>of</HI> all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in like Manner, for off on upon to unto, till until, from at in within, out with|out, into out of, about over under, above be|low, between among, before behind after, for, by, with, through, again&s;t, concerning, and by this time he will be pretty well ina|bled to under&s;tand a &s;ingle Sentence.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place; he is in like Manner to be taught Conjunctions, which &s;erve to Connect not Words only, but Sentences, as and al&s;o, likewi&s;e, either or whether, neither
<PB N="51" REF="76">
nor, if then, why, wherefore, becau&s;e, there|fore, but, though, yet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the&s;e Illu&s;tra|ted by convenient Examples in each ca&s;e as, <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> I am cold, <HI>therefore</HI> I go to the fire, <HI>that</HI> I may be warm, <HI>for</HI> it is cold weather.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> it were fair, <HI>then</HI> it would be good walking, but however, <HI>though</HI> it rain, <HI>yet</HI> I mu&s;t go, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> I promi&s;ed with other like In&s;tances.</P>
<P>And by this time his Book, if well fur|ni&s;hed with plenty of Words, and tho&s;e well dige&s;ted under &s;everal Heads, and in good Order, and well recruited from time to time as new Words occur, will &s;erve him in the Nature of a <HI>Dictionary</HI> and <HI>Grammar.</HI></P>
<P>And in ca&s;e the Deaf Per&s;on be otherwi&s;e of a good Natural Capacity, and the Teach|er of a good Sagacity; by this Method, pro|ceeding gradually &s;tep by &s;tep, you may, with diligence and due Application of Teach|er and Learner in a Years Time, or there|abouts, perceive a greater Progre&s;s than you would expect, and a good Foundation laid for further In&s;truction in matters of Reli|gion, and other Knowledge which may be taught by Books.</P>
<P>It will be convenient all along to have Pen, Ink, and Paper, ready at hand, to write down in a Word, what you &s;ignifie to him, by Signs, and cau&s;e him to write, or &s;hew how to write, what he &s;ignifies by Signs; which
<PB N="52" REF="77">
way of &s;ignifying their mind by Signs, Deaf Per&s;ons are often very good at. And we mu&s;t endeavour to learn their Language, if I may &s;o call it, in order to teach them ours; by &s;hewing what Words an&s;wer to their Signs.</P>
<P>'Twill be convenient al&s;o, as you go a|long, after &s;ome convenient Progre&s;s made, to expre&s;s, in as plain Language as may be, the Import of &s;ome of the Tables; as for In&s;tance,</P>
<P>The Head is the highe&s;t part of the Body, the Feet the lowe&s;t part, the Face is the fore|part of the Head, the Forehead is over the Eyes, the Cheeks are under the Eyes, the No&s;e is between the Cheeks, the Mouth is under the No&s;e, and above the Chin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;uch plain Di&s;cour&s;e put into writing, and particularly explained, will teach him by degrees to under&s;tand plain Sentences; and like Advantages, a Sagacious Teacher may take, as occa&s;ion offers it&s;elf from Time to Time.</P>

<P>OUR Young Boy now between &s;ix and &s;even Years of Age, half a <HI>Highlander</HI> and half a <HI>Laplander,</HI> delighted in wearing a little Bonnet and Plaid, thinking it looked very Manly in his Countrymen, and his Father, a&s;|&s;oon as he was out of his Hanging Sleeves and left off his Boys Ve&s;t, indulged him with that kind of Dre&s;s, which is truly Antique and Heroick. In this early part of his Nonage he was brought to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> by his Mother in Law, where I my &s;elf grew afre&s;h ac|quainted with her, his Father being then but lately Dead. Ju&s;t after the Civil Commo|tion,

and off and on have known him ever &s;ince, and Conver&s;ed with him very frequent|ly during that &s;pace of time which now is about three or four and thirty Years, &s;o that whatever I &s;ay concerning him in the future Pages, I &s;hall relate to the Reader from my own certain Knowledge, which, as I re&s;olve to continue Anonymous, may perhaps not have &s;o much Weight and Authority as if I had prefix'd my Name to the Account. Be that as it will, there are hundreds of living Wit|ne&s;&s;es, that will ju&s;tifie each Action I relate, and his own future Actions while he lives will procure belief and credit to the precedent ones which I am going to record; &s;o that if many do remain Infidels to my Relations and will not allow them Exact (the fate of many as credible and more Important Hi&s;torians than my &s;elf) I can however venture to flatter my &s;elf that greater will be the Number of tho&s;e, who will have a Faith in my Writings, than of tho&s;e, who will reject my Accounts as Incredible.</P>

<P>In the Year 1685. the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> &s;ailed out of the Ports of <HI>Holland</HI> without any Ob&s;truction, the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> in <HI>May</HI> with three Ships for <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and <HI>Monmouth</HI> in <HI>June</HI> with the &s;ame Number for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl &s;etting out fir&s;t, was al&s;o the fir&s;t at Landing. <HI>Argyll</HI> having attempted to Land in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being di&s;appointed by the Vigilance of the Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Orcades,</HI> Landed in the We&s;t, and Incamped at <HI>Dun&s;tafne</HI> Ca&s;tle in the Province of <HI>Lorn,</HI> which had belonged to him. He omitted nothing that might draw over to him all the Malecontents in the Kingdom, whom he thought more Numerous than they after|wards appeared to be. He di&s;per&s;ed about his Declarations, wherein, after prote&s;ting, that he had taken up Arms only in Defence of Religion and the Laws, again&s;t an inju&s;t U&s;urper (&s;o he Stiled King <HI>James</HI> the Second) he invited all good Prote&s;tants, and &s;uch <HI>Scotch</HI> as would a&s;&s;ert the Liberty to join him a|gain&s;t a Prince, he &s;aid, was got into the Throne, to ruin the Reformation, and to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power. Next he &s;ent Letters to tho&s;e he thought his Friends, (among whom was Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell,</HI> who according to the va&s;t deference payed by the <HI>Scots</HI> to their Chief, joined him, tho,

All his Contrivances could not rai&s;e him above three Thou&s;and Men, with whom he Incamped in the I&s;le of <HI>Boot,</HI> where he was &s;oon in a manner Be&s;ieged by the Earl of <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> with the King's Forces, and &s;everal other Bodies Commanded by the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> and other Great Men, who came from all Parts to quench the Fire before it grew to a Head.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> being obliged to quit a Po&s;t he could not make good, went over into a Part of the Country of his own Name, where having ha&s;tily Fortified a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Ellingrey,</HI> he put into it the Arms and Am|munition taken out of his Ships, which lay at Anchor under the Cannon of a Fort; he E|rected near that Place. There his Rout be|gan; for going out from the Ca&s;tle with his Forces to make an Incur&s;ion, one of his Par|ties was Defeated by the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol,</HI> who &s;lew four hundred of his Men; and Captain <HI>Hamilton</HI> who Attacked his Ships with &s;ome of the King's, and took them without any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="84">
The Earl of <HI>Dunbarton</HI> advancing towards him, at the &s;ame time, by long Marches, while he Endeavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf by Rivers, &s;urprized him pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Clyde</HI> in the Village of <HI>Killern,</HI> as he was Marching towards <HI>Lenox. Dunbarton</HI> coming upon them at Night, would have &s;taid till the next Day to Attack the Rebels, but they gave him not &s;o much time, for they pa&s;&s;ed the River in the Night, in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that being overcome with fear; they di&s;per&s;ed as &s;oon as over. <HI>Argyle</HI> could &s;carce rally &s;o many as would make him a &s;mall Guard, which was &s;oon &s;cattered again; <HI>Dunbarton</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed the River, and divided his For|ces to pur&s;ue tho&s;e that fled. <HI>Argyle</HI> had ta|ken Guides to Conduct him to <HI>Galloway;</HI> but they mi&s;taking the way, and leading him into a Bog, mo&s;t of tho&s;e, that &s;till followed him, quitted their Hor&s;es, every Man &s;hift|ing for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Argyle</HI> him&s;elf was making back alone to|wards the <HI>Clyde,</HI> when two Re&s;olute Servants, belonging to an Officer in the King's Army meeting him, tho' they knew him not, bid him Surrender. He fir'd at, and mi&s;&s;ed them; but they took better Aim, and wounded him with a Pi&s;tol Ball. Then the Earl drawing his two Pi&s;tols out of the Hol&s;ters, quitted his Hor&s;e, that was quite tired, and took the River. A Country Fellow, who came with tho&s;e two, that had fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted him pur|&s;ued
<PB N="60" REF="85">
him with a Pi&s;tol in his Hand; the Earl would have fired one of his, but the flint fail|ing he was dangerou&s;ly wounded in the Head, by the Pea&s;ant. He di&s;covered him&s;elf, as he fell Sen&s;ele&s;s; crying out, <HI>Unfortunate Argyle.</HI> This Nobleman how far &s;oever he may be thought mi&s;led in Principle, was certainly in his Per&s;on a very Brave and a very Gallant Hero. They made ha&s;t to draw him out and bring him to him&s;elf; after which being delivered up to the Officers, the Erring unfortunate Great Man was Conducted to <HI>Edingburgh</HI> and there Beheaded.</P>
<P>Many Gentlemen that followed the For|tunes of this Great Man, tho' not in his Death they &s;hared in all the other Calamities at|tending his overthrow. They mo&s;t of them fled into the remote&s;t I&s;les and the ob&s;cure&s;t corners of all <HI>Scotland:</HI> Contented with the &s;aving of their Lives; they grew Exiles and Bani&s;hed Men of their own making, and Abdicated their E&s;tates before they were known to be Forfeited, becau&s;e, for fear of being informed again&s;t by the Common Fel|lows they Commanded, they dur&s;t not ap|pear to lay their Claims. Of this Number was Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell,</HI> and this new Di&s;a&s;ter wounded him deep into the very Heart, after &s;o many late mi&s;adventures, and &s;ent him untimely to the Grave. He perfectly pined away and wa&s;ted; he was &s;ix Months dying Inch by Inch, and the Dif|ference between his lea&s;t Breath and his way

of Breathing during all that time, was only, that he Expired with a greater Sigh than he ordinarily fetched every time when he drew his Breath.</P>
<P>Every thing the <HI>Lapland</HI> Lady had Pre|dicted &s;o long before, being thus come to pa&s;s, we may the le&s;s admire at the wonders performed by her Son, when we con&s;ider this faculty of Divination to be &s;o derived to him from her, and Grown as it were Here|ditary.</P>
<P>Our Young Prophet, who had taught mo&s;t of his little Companions to conver&s;e with him by Finger, was the Head at every little Pa&s;time and Game they Played at. Marbles (which he u&s;ed to call Children's playing at Bowls) yielded him mighty Diver&s;ion; and he was &s;o dexterous and Arti&s;t at &s;hooting that little Alabla&s;ter Globe from between the end of his fore-finger and the knuckle of his Thumb, that he &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed hitting <HI>Plum</HI> (as the Boys call it) the Marble he aimed at, tho' at the di&s;tance of two or three yards. The Boys always when they played coveted to have him on their &s;ide, and by hearing that he foretold other things, u&s;ed to con&s;ult him, when they made their little Matches (which were things of great Importance in their Thoughts) who &s;hould get the Victory. He u&s;ed commonly to leave the&s;e trifles undeci|ded, but if ever he gave his Opinion in the&s;e trivial Affairs, the Per&s;ons fared well by
<PB N="62" REF="87">
their Con&s;ultation, for his Judgment about them was like a petty Oracle, and the end always An&s;wered his Prediction. But I would have my Reader imagin (that tho' our <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> was him&s;elf but a Boy) He was not con&s;ulted only by Boys; his Pene|tration and In&s;ight into things of a high Nature, got Air, and being atte&s;ted by cre|dible Witne&s;&s;es won him the E&s;teem of Per|&s;ons of Mature Years and Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If a Beautiful young Virgin langui&s;hed for a Husband; or a Widow's Mind was in La|bour to have a &s;econd venture of Infants by another Spou&s;e: If a Hou&s;ekeeper had lo&s;t any thing belonging to her Ma&s;ter, &s;till little <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> was at Hand; he was the Oracle to be applied to, and the little Chalk'd Circle, where he was diverting him&s;elf with his play-fellows near the Cro&s;s at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> was frequented with as much &s;olicitation and as much credit, as the <HI>Tripos</HI> of <HI>Apollo</HI> was at <HI>Delphos</HI> in Ancient times.</P>
<P>It was highly Entertaining to &s;ee a Young Blooming Beauty come and &s;lily pick up the Boy from his Company, carry him home with as much eagerne&s;s as &s;he would her Gallant, becau&s;e &s;he knew &s;he &s;hould get the Name of her Gallant out of him before he went, and bribe him with a Sugar Plumb to write down the Name of a Young <HI>Scotch</HI> Peer in a green Ribbon that her Mouth watered after.</P>

How often after he has been wallowing in the du&s;t have I my &s;elf &s;een nice &s;queami&s;h Widows help him up in their gilded Chariots and give him a Plea&s;ant ride with them, that he might tell them they &s;hould not long lie a lone; little <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> had as much bu&s;ine&s;s upon his Hands as the Par&s;ons of all the Pari&s;hes in <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> He com|monly was con&s;ulted and named the Couples before the Mini&s;ter joined them; thus he grew a rare Cu&s;tomer to the Toy&s;hop, from whence he mo&s;t an end received Fees and Rewards for his Advices. If Lady <HI>Betty</HI> &s;uch a one was foretold that &s;he &s;hould cer|tainly have Beau &s;uch a one in Marriage; then little <HI>Duncan</HI> was &s;ure to have a Hobby-Hor&s;e from the Toy&s;hop as a Reward for the promi&s;ed Fop.

<P>Neither were the Women only his con&s;ul|ters; the Grave Merchants, who were An|xious for many ventures at Sea, applied to the Boy for his Opinion of their &s;ecurity, and they looked upon his Opinion to be as &s;afe as the In&s;urance Office for Ships.

fir&s;t indeed he would try, when the Child foretold him his ill Fortune, whether it would prove true, and relying upon the mere hazard and turn of the Dye, he had always (as he ob&s;erved) a run of ill Luck on tho&s;e forbid|den Days, as he never fail'd of good if he cho&s;e the fortunate Hours directed by the Boy. One time above all the re&s;t, ju&s;t be|fore he was departing from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and when the Sea&s;on of Gaming was almo&s;t over, mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Wealth and Di&s;tinction with|drawing for Plea&s;ure to their Seats in the Country, he came to young <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> to con&s;ult; and was extremely &s;olicitous to know, how happily or unluckily he &s;hould end that <HI>Term</HI> (as we may call it) of the Game|&s;ters <HI>weighty Bu&s;ine&s;s, viz.

and continue to have to a great degree with &s;ome &s;elect Parts of Mankind, 2<HI>dly,</HI> concern|ing the wonderful and almo&s;t miraculous Power of a Second Sight, with which many beyond all controver&s;y have been extraor|dinarily but vi&s;ibly gifted; and 3<HI>dly,</HI> con|cerning the pitch of Perfection, to which the magick Science has been carry'd and promo|ted by &s;ome adepts in that mi&s;terious Art; I will premi&s;e a few particulars about the <HI>Ge|nii,</HI> which attended our little <HI>Duncan Camp|bell,</HI> and about the Second Sight, which he had when yet a Child, and when we may much more ea&s;ily believe, that the Wonders, he perform'd and wrote of, mu&s;t have been ra|ther brought about by the intervention of &s;uch <HI>Genii</HI> and the mediation of &s;uch a Sight; than that he could have invented &s;uch Fables concerning them, and compa&s;&s;ed &s;uch Predi|ctions as &s;eem'd to want their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by the mere dint of a Child's Capacity.</P>
<P>One Day, I remember, when he was a|bout Nine Years of Age, going early to the Hou&s;e, where he and his Mother liv'd, and it being before his Mother was &s;tirring, I went into little <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI>'s Room to divert my&s;elf with him, I found him &s;itting up in his Bed with his Eyes broad open, but as motionle&s;s as if he had been a&s;leep, or even (if it had not been for a lively beautiful Co|lour which the little pretty fair Silver Hair'd Boy always had in his Cheeks) as if he had
<PB N="70" REF="95">
been quite dead; he did not &s;eem &s;o much as to breath; the Eylids of him were &s;o fix'd and immovable, that the Eyla&s;hes did not &s;o much as once &s;hake, which the lea&s;t Motion ima|ginable mu&s;t agitate; not to &s;ay that he was like a Per&s;on in an <HI>Ex&s;tacy,</HI> he was at lea&s;t in what (we commonly call) a <HI>Brown Study</HI> to the highe&s;t degree, and for the large&s;t &s;pace of time I ever knew. I, who had been fre|quently inform'd by People, who have been pre&s;ent at the Operations of Second Sighted Per&s;ons, that, at the Sight of a Vi&s;ion, the Eylids of the Per&s;on are erected, and the Eyes continue &s;taring till the Object vani&s;hes, I (I&s;ay) &s;ate my&s;elf &s;oftly down on his Bed-&s;ide, and with a quiet Amazement ob&s;erv'd him, avoiding diligently any Motion, that might give him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance, or cau&s;e in him any avocation or di&s;traction of Mind from the Bu&s;ine&s;s he was &s;o intent upon. I re|mark'd that he held his Head <HI>&s;ide-ways</HI> with his Mouth wide open and in a <HI>li&s;t'ning</HI> Po|&s;ture, and <HI>that</HI> after &s;o lively a manner, as, at fir&s;t general thought, made me forget his Deafne&s;s and plainly imagin he heard &s;ome|thing, till the Second thought of Reflection brought into my Mind the Misfortune that &s;hut up all Pa&s;&s;age for any Sound through his Ears. After a &s;tedfa&s;t Gaze, which la&s;ted about Seven Minutes, he &s;miled, and &s;tretch'd his Arms as one recovering from a Fit of In|dolence, and rubb'd his Eyes; then turning

towards me, he made the Sign of a Salute, and hinted to me, upon his Fingers, his de&s;ire for Pen, Ink and Paper, which I reach'd him from a little Desk, that &s;tood at his Bed's|feet.</P>
<P>Placing the Paper upon his Knees he wrote me the following Lines, which together with my An&s;wers I pre&s;erve by me, for their Ra|rity, to this very Day, and which I have tran&s;cribed Word for Word, as they form a little Series of Dialogue.</P>
<P>Duncan Campbell. <HI>I am &s;orry I cant &s;tay with you; but I &s;hall &s;ee my pretty Youth and my Lamb by, and by, in the Fields, near a little Coppice, or Grove, where I go often to play with them, and I would not lo&s;e their Company for the whole World; for they and I are mighty familiar to|gether, and the Boy tells me every thing, that gets me my Reputation among the Ladies and Nobility, and you mu&s;t keep it Secret.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Que&s;tion.</HI> I will be &s;ure to keep it &s;e|cret: But how do you know you are to meet them there to Day? Did the little Boy ap|point you?</P>
<P>Duncan Campbell. <HI>Ye&s;s he did, and &s;igni|fy'd, that he had &s;everal things to predict to me, concerning People, that, he fore-knew, would come to me, the Week following, to ask me Que&s;tions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Que&s;tion.</HI> But what was you &s;taring at, when I came in?</P>
<P>Duncan Campbell. <HI>Why, at that little Boy,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="98">
<HI>that goes along with the Lamb I &s;peak of, and 'twas</HI> then <HI>he made me the Appointment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Que&s;tion.</HI> How does he do it? Does he write?</P>
<P>Duncan Campbell. <HI>No, he writes &s;ometimes, but oftner he &s;peaks with his Fingers, and mighty &s;wift; No Man can do it &s;o quick, or write half &s;o &s;oon; he has a little Bell in his Hand, like that, which my Mother makes me a Sign to &s;hake, when &s;he wants the Servants; with That he tickles my Brain &s;trangely, and gives me an incredible Delight of</HI> feeling <HI>in the</HI> in&s;ide <HI>of my Head; he u&s;ually wakes me with it in the Morning, when he comes to make me an Appointment. I fan|cy, 'tis what you call</HI> Hearing, <HI>which makes me mighty de&s;irous I could</HI> hear <HI>in your way; 'tis &s;wee|ter to the feeling, methinks, than any thing is to the ta&s;t; It is ju&s;t as if my Head was tickled to Death, as my Nur&s;e u&s;ed to tickle my Sides; but 'tis a different feeling, for it makes things like little Strings, tremble in my Temples, and behind my Ears. Now I remember, I will tell you what 'tis like, that makes me believe 'tis like your</HI> Hearing, <HI>and that &s;trange thing, which you, that can &s;peak, call Sound or Noi&s;e: Becau&s;e, when I was at Church with my Mo|ther, who told me the Bells could be heard ring|ing a Mile off: As I was kneeling on the Bench, and leaning over the top of the Pew and gnaw|ing the Board, every time, the Man pull'd the Rope, I thought all my Head beat, as if it would come to Pieces, but yet it plea&s;ed me,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="99">
<HI>methought, rather than pain'd me, and I would be always gnawing the Board, when the Man pull'd the Rope, and I told my Mother the rea|&s;on: The feeling of that was &s;omething like the little Bell, but only</HI> that <HI>made my Head</HI> throb <HI>as if it would break, and</HI> this tickles <HI>me and makes, as it were, little Strings on the back of my Ears dance and tremble like any thing, is not that like your way of</HI> Hearing?&mdash;<HI>If it be it is a &s;weet thing to hear.&mdash;It is more plea|&s;ant than to &s;ee the fine&s;t Colours in the World,&mdash;it is &s;omething like being tickled in the No&s;e with a Feather till one Sneezes, or like the feeling, after one &s;trikes the Leg, when it has been numb or a&s;leep, only with this dif|ference, that tho&s;e Two ways give a Pain and the other a Plea&s;ure; I remember too, when I had a great Cold for about Two Months, I had a feeling &s;omething like it, but that was blunt, dull, confus'd and trouble&s;ome. Is not this like what you call</HI> Hearing?</P>
<P><HI>My Que&s;tion.</HI> It is the fine&s;t kind of hear|ing, my Dear, it is what we call Mu&s;ick. But what &s;ort of a Boy is that, that meets you? And what &s;ort of a Lamb?</P>
<P>Duncan Campbell. <HI>Oh! tho' they are like other Boys and other Lambs which you &s;ee, they are a Thou&s;and Times prettier and finer; you never &s;aw &s;uch a Boy nor &s;uch a Lamb in your Life-time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Que&s;tion.</HI> How big is he? As big as you are? And what &s;ort of a Boy is he?</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="100">
Duncan Campbell. <HI>He is a little little pret|ty Boy, about as tall as my Knee, his Face is as white as Snow, and &s;o are his little Hands; his Cheeks are as red as a Cherry, and &s;o are his Lips; and, when he Breaths, it makes the Air more perfum'd than my Mother's &s;weet Baggs that &s;he puts among the Linnen; he has got a Crown of Ro&s;es, Cow&s;lips, and other Flowers upon his Head, &s;uch as the Maids gather in</HI> May; <HI>his Hair is like fine Silver Threads, and &s;hine like the Beams of the Sun; he wears a loo&s;e Veil down to his Feet, that is as Blue as the Sky in a clear Day, and embroider'd with Spangles, that look like the brighte&s;t Stars in the Night; he carries a Silver Bell in one Hand, and a Book and Pencil in the other; and he and the little Lamb will dance and leap about me in a Ring as high as my Head; the Lamb has got a little Silver Collar with Nine little Bells upon it; and every little piece of Wooll upon its Back, that is as white Milk, is tied up all round it in Puffs like a little Mi&s;&s;es Hair, with Ribbons of all Colours; and round its Head too are little Ro&s;es and Violets &s;tuck very thick into the Wooll that grows upon its Forehead, and behind and be|tween its Ears in the Shape of a Diadem. They fir&s;t meet me dancing thus; and after they have danc'd &s;ometime, the little Boy writes down wonderful things in his Book, which I write down in mine; then they dance again, till he rings his Bell, and then they are gone</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="101">
<HI>all of a &s;udden I know not where; but I feel the tickling in the in&s;ide of my Head caus'd by the Bell le&s;s and le&s;s, 'til I don't feel it at all, and then I go home, read over my Le&s;&s;on in my Book, and when I have it by heart, I burn the written Leaves, according as the little Boy bids me, or he would let me have no more. But I hear the little Bell again, the little Boy is angry with me, he</HI> pull'd <HI>me</HI> Twice <HI>by the</HI> Ear, <HI>and I would not di&s;plea&s;e him for any thing; &s;o I mu&s;t get up and go immediately, to the Joy and Delight of my Life.</HI></P>
<P>I told him he might, if he would promi&s;e me to tell me further another time; he &s;aid he would, if I would keep it &s;ecret. I told him I would, and &s;o we parted; tho' ju&s;t be|fore he went, he &s;aid he <HI>&s;melt</HI> &s;ome Veni&s;on, and he was &s;ure they would &s;hortly have &s;ome for Dinner; and nothing was &s;o &s;ure as that, my Man had my Orders to bring a Side of Veni&s;on to me the next Day to Mrs. <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s, for I had been hunting, and came thi|ther from the death of a Deer that Morning; and intended as u&s;ual to make a &s;tay there for Two or Three Days.</P>
<P>There are I know many Men of &s;evere Principles, and who are more Strict, Grave and Formal, in their manner of thinking, than they are Wi&s;e; who will be apt to judge of the&s;e relations, as things merely Fabulous and Chimerical, and, not contented with be|ing di&s;-believers by them&s;elves, will la|bour

to in&s;inuate into others this pernicious Notion, that it is a &s;ign of Infirmity and Weakne&s;s in the Head, to yield them Credit. But tho' I could ea&s;ily argue the&s;e <HI>Sir Gravities</HI> down; tho' a Sentence or Two would do their Bu&s;ine&s;s, put them beyond the Power of replying, and &s;trike them Dumb, yet do I thing it not worth my while; their greate&s;t and mo&s;t wonted Objection again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Eu|demons</HI> and <HI>Kakodemons,</HI> being, that it ari&s;es all from the work of fancy, in Per&s;ons of a me|lancholick Blood. If we con&s;ider the nature of this Child's Dialogue with me, will it not be more whim&s;ically &s;trange and miraculous, to &s;ay, that a Child of Nine Years old had only a fancy of &s;uch things as the&s;e, of which it had never heard any Body give an account, and that it could by the mere &s;trength of Ima|gination predict &s;uch things as really after came to pa&s;s, than it is (when it does &s;o &s;trangely predict things) to believe the Child does it, in the <HI>manner</HI> it&s;elf owns it does, which is by the intervention of a good <HI>Demon,</HI> or a happy Genius. Departing therefore from the&s;e &s;ingular wi&s;e Mens Opinions, who will believe nothing Excellent can happen to o|thers, which it has not been their Lot to en|joy a &s;hare of, I &s;hall take my farewel ha&s;tily of them (without loo&s;ing my own time or theirs) in the Words of the ingenious and learned Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Clerc.

<P>I &s;hall rather &s;ee how far the&s;e things have lain open to the Eyes of, and been explain'd by the ancient Sages; I will relate who a|mong them were happy in their <HI>Genii,</HI> and who among the Moderns, who&s;e Examples may be Authorities for our Belief; I will &s;et down as clearly as I can, what Perception Men have had of <HI>Genii</HI> or Spirits, by the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, what by the &s;en&s;e of hearing, what by the &s;en&s;e of feeling, touching or ta|&s;ting, and in fine, what Perception others have had of the&s;e <HI>Genii</HI> by all the Sen&s;es, what by Dreams and what by Magick, a thing rarely to be met with at once in any &s;ingle Man, and which &s;eems particular to the Child, who was the Subject of our la&s;t little hi&s;torical Account. When I have brought Examples and the Opinions of wi&s;e Philo&s;ophers, and the Evidence of undeniable Witne&s;&s;es, which one would think &s;ufficient to evince Per&s;ons of the Commerce Men have with Spirits, if they were not pa&s;t all &s;en&s;e of Conviction: I &s;hall, not &s;o much to corrobo|rate what I &s;ay, as to &s;hame &s;ome Wi&s;eacres, who would by their frail Rea&s;on &s;can all things, and pretend to &s;olve the My&s;teries a&s;cribed to Spirits as Facts merely natural, and who would bani&s;h from the Thoughts of Men all belief of Spirits what&s;oever, I &s;hall I &s;ay (in order to put to &s;hame the&s;e Wi&s;e|acres,

if they have any Shame left) produce the Opinions of the Fathers as Divines, &s;hew the Doctrines of Spirits in general to be con|&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity, that they are de|liver'd in the Scripture and by Chri&s;tian Tra|dition, in which if they will not acquie&s;ce, I &s;hall leave them to the Labyrinth of their own wild Opinions, which in the end will &s;o perplex their Judgments of things, that they will be never able to extricate them|&s;elves, and the&s;e different Heads will be the Subject of the Chapter en&s;uing, and will (or I am greatly mi&s;taken) form both an in&s;tru|ctive edifying and entertaining Di&s;cour&s;e, for a Reader really and truly intelligent, and that has a good ta&s;te and reli&s;h for &s;ublime things.</P>

<P>IT is &s;aid in the Ninth Book of the Mo|rals of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> it is better to come at the probable Knowledge of &s;ome things a|bove us in the Heavens, than to be capable of giving many Demon&s;trations relating to things here below, This is no doubt an ad|mirable Propo&s;ition, and &s;peaks the lofty aims

of that &s;ublime Mind from whence it pro|ceeded. Among all the di&s;qui&s;itions in this kind, none &s;eem to me more excellent, than tho&s;e, which treat concerning the <HI>Genii,</HI> that attend upon Men and guide them in the A|ctions of Life. A Genius or <HI>Demon</HI> of the good Kind is a &s;ort of mediate Being, between Humane and Divine, which gives the Mind of Man a plea&s;ant Conjunction with Angelick and Cele&s;tial Faculties, and brings down to Earth a faint participation of the Joys of Heaven. That there have been &s;uch fortu|nate Attendants upon wi&s;e Men, we have many rare In&s;tances.

&s;o well atte&s;ted with &s;uch an air of Truth, as to make the Truth of the Hi&s;tory doubted by others as well as them&s;elves, where no demon&s;trative Proof can be brought to con|vince them.

Mr. <HI>Glanvil</HI> in his Collections of Relations, for proving Apparitions, Spirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tells us of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man, that had like to have been carried away by Spirits, and of the Gho&s;t of a Man who had been Seven Years dead, that brought a Medicine to his Bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>The Relation is thus.</P>
<P>A Gentleman in <HI>Ireland,</HI> near to the Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI>'s &s;ending his Butler one After-noon to buy Cards; as he pa&s;s'd a Field, to his Won|der, he e&s;py'd a Company of People &s;itting round a Table, with a deal of good Cheer before them, in the mid'&s;t of the Field: And he going up towards them they all aro&s;e and &s;aluted him, and de&s;ir'd him to &s;it down with them; but one of them wi&s;per'd the&s;e Words in his Ear.&mdash;<HI>Do nothing this Company invites you to.</HI> Hereupon he refus'd to &s;it down at the Table, and immediately Table and all that belong'd to it were gone, and the Com|pany are now dancing and playing upon Mu|&s;ical In&s;truments.

<PB N="82" REF="108">
again to him&s;elf, he related to his Ma&s;ter what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Night following there comes one of his Company to his Bed-&s;ide, and tells him, <HI>that if he offered to &s;tir out of the Doors the next Day, he would be carried away.</HI> Here|upon he kept within; but towards the Eve|ning having need to make Water, he adven|tur'd to put one Foot over the Thre&s;hold, &s;everal &s;tanding by, which he had no &s;ooner done but they e&s;py'd a Rope ca&s;t about his Middle; and the poor Man was hurried a|way with great Swiftne&s;s, they following him as fa&s;t as they could, but could not o|vertake him, at length they e&s;py'd an Hor&s;e|man coming towards him, and made Signs to him to &s;top the Man whom he &s;aw co|ming near him, and both ends of the Rope, but nobody drawing; when they met he laid hold of one end of the Rope, and imme|diately had a &s;mart blow given him over his Arm with the other end; but by this means the Man was &s;topp'd, and the Hor&s;e-man brought him back with him.</P>

avail to the &s;aving of him; upon this he was kept in a large Room with a con&s;iderable Number of Per&s;ons to guard him, among whom was the famous Stroaker Mr. <HI>Grea|trix,</HI> who was a Neighbour.

<P>Till part of the Afternoon was &s;pent all was quiet, but at length he was perceiv'd to ri&s;e from the Ground, whereupon Mr. <HI>Grea|trix</HI> and another lu&s;ty Man clapt their Arms over his Shoulders, one of them before him and the other behind, and weigh'd him down with all their Strength; but he was forcibly taken up from them, and they were too weak to keep their hold, and for a con&s;iderable time he was carry'd into the Air, to and fro over their Heads, &s;everal of the Company &s;till running under him to prevent his receiv|ing hurt, if he &s;hould fall, at length he fell, and was caught before he came to the Ground and had by that means no hurt.</P>
<P>All being quiet till Bed-time, <HI>My LORD</HI> order'd Two of his Servants to lie with him, and the next Morning he told his Lord&s;hip, that his <HI>Spectre</HI> was again with him, and brought a wooden Di&s;h with grey Liquor in it and bid him drink it off; at the fir&s;t &s;ight

<P>A Vi&s;ion which happened to the ingenious and learned Dr. <HI>Donne,</HI> may not improperly be here in&s;erted. Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Walton</HI> writing the Life of the &s;aid Doctor, tells us, that the Doctor and his Wife living with Sir <HI>Robert Drury,</HI> who gave them a free Entertainment at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Drury-lane;</HI> it happen'd that the Lord <HI>Haye</HI> was by King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent in an Amba&s;&s;y to the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. whom Sir <HI>Robert</HI> re&s;olv'd to Accompany, and in|gag'd Dr. <HI>Donne</HI> to go with them, who&s;e Wife was then with Child, at Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s Hou&s;e.

<P>Captain <HI>Henry Bell</HI> in his Narrative pre|fix'd to <HI>Luther</HI>'s Table, printed in <HI>Engli&s;h, Anno,</HI> 1652. having acquainted us how the <HI>German</HI> Copy printed of it had been di&s;co|ver'd under Ground, where it had lain hid Fifty Two Years, that Edition having been &s;uppre&s;t by an Edict of the Emperor <HI>Rudol|phus</HI> II. &s;o that it was Death for any Per&s;on to keep a Copy thereof, and having told us that <HI>Ca&s;parus Van Spar</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Gentleman, with whom he was familiarly acquainted, while he negotiated Affairs in <HI>Germany</HI> for King <HI>James</HI> I. was the Per&s;on that di&s;cover'd it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1626. and tran&s;mitted it into <HI>Eng|land</HI> to him, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired him to Tran&s;late the &s;aid Book into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ays, he accordingly &s;et upon the Tran&s;lation of it many times, but was always hinder'd from Proceeding in it by &s;ome intervening Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<HI>admoni&s;hed often, of the Death he &s;hould die, in this Manner.</HI></P>
<P>An aged Gentleman, one <HI>Parker,</HI> as I now remember, having formerly belonged unto the Duke, or of great Acquaintance with the Duke's Father, and now retired, had a <HI>Demon</HI> appeared &s;everal Times to him in the &s;hape of Sir <HI>George Villiers,</HI> the Duke's Fa|ther: This <HI>Demon</HI> walk'd many Times in <HI>Parker</HI>'s Bed-chamber, without any Action of Terror, Noi&s;e, Hurt or Speech; but at la&s;t, one Night, broke out in the&s;e Words: Mr. <HI>Parker,</HI> I know you loved me formerly, and my Son <HI>George</HI> at this Time very well, I would have you go from me, (you know me very well to be his Father old Sir <HI>George Villiers</HI> of <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire</HI>) and acquaint him with <HI>the&s;e</HI> and <HI>the&s;e Particulars, &amp;c.</HI> and that he <HI>above all refrain</HI> the <HI>Council</HI> and <HI>Company</HI> of <HI>&s;uch</HI> and <HI>&s;uch,</HI> whom he then <HI>nominated,</HI> or el&s;e he will come to <HI>De&s;tru|ction,</HI> and that <HI>&s;uddenly.

This Man had in his Youth been bred in a School in the Pari&s;h where Sir <HI>George Villiers,</HI> the Father of the Duke lived, and had been much cheri&s;h'd and obliged in that Sea&s;on of his Age, by the &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> whom after|wards he never &s;aw. About Six Months be|fore the mi&s;erable End of the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI> the Apparition was &s;een; after the Third Appearance he made a Journey to <HI>London,</HI> where the Court then was; he was very well known to Sir <HI>Ralph Freeman,</HI> one of the Ma&s;ters of the Reque&s;ts, who had married a Lady that was near allied to the

Duke, and was him&s;elf well receiv'd by him. He inform'd the Duke with the Reputation and Hone&s;ty of the Man, and Sir <HI>Ralph Free|man</HI> carry'd the Man the next Morning, by Five of the Clock, to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> according to the Duke's Appointment, and there pre&s;ented him to the Duke, who receiv'd him courte|ou&s;ly at his landing, and walk'd in Conference near an Hour with him, and Sir <HI>Ralph</HI>'s and the Duke's Servants at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that they heard not a Word; but Sir <HI>Ralph</HI> al|ways fix'd his <HI>Eyes</HI> on the Duke, who &s;ome|times &s;poke with great <HI>Commotion</HI> and <HI>Di&s;|order;</HI> and that the Man told Sir <HI>Ralph</HI> in their return over the Water, that when he <HI>mentioned</HI> tho&s;e <HI>particulars</HI> that were to gain him <HI>Credit,</HI> the Duke's <HI>Colour changed,</HI> and he &s;wore he could come to that Knowledge only by the <HI>Devil;</HI> for that tho&s;e particulars were known only to him&s;elf, and to one Per|&s;on more, who, he was &s;ure, would never &s;peak of them.

<P>I will now &s;ubjoin an authentick Relation, which Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> tells us at the end of his Book of <HI>Genii</HI> or familiar Spirits, printed in the Year 1705. he had ju&s;t before receiv'd from the Mouth of the then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter</HI> him&s;elf.

The Maid &s;aid &s;he left none, and there was none, but what &s;he brought with her at that Time. Then &s;he &s;aid it was the Fire: But that the Maid told her was quite out, and &s;aid &s;he believ'd it was only a Dream; whereupon &s;he &s;aid it might be &s;o, and compos'd her&s;elf again to Sleep, but about Two of the Clock &s;he was awaken'd a|gain, and &s;aw the Apparition of a little Wo|man between her Curtain and her Pillow; who told her &s;he was her Mother, and that &s;he was Happy, and that by Twelve of the Clock that Day, &s;he &s;hould be with her; whereupon, &s;he knock'd again for her Maid, called for her Cloaths, and when &s;he was dre&s;s'd, went into her Clo&s;et, and came not out again till Nine; and then brought out with her a Letter &s;ealed to her Father, brought it to her Aunt, the Lady <HI>Everard,</HI> told her what had happen'd, and de&s;ir'd, that, a&s;&s;oon as &s;he was Dead, it might be &s;ent to him; but the Lady thought &s;he was &s;uddenly fallen

<P>The fir&s;t Story, which has in it &s;uch amaz|ing Circum&s;tances, and &s;uch uncommon and dreadful Incidents concerning the Butler in <HI>Ireland,</HI> is (as the Reader &s;ees) atte&s;ted by no le&s;s a Per&s;onage than an Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> Two Bi&s;hops, and many other Noblemen and Gen|tlemen, being pre&s;ent and Eye-witne&s;&s;es of what the Earl &s;aid.

<P>The Second Story is founded, fir&s;t, upon the Experience of one of the mo&s;t ingenious Men of that Age, Dr. <HI>Donne,</HI> and then upon the Proof made by his Friend, Sir <HI>Robert Drury,</HI> who could at fir&s;t &s;carce believe it; and &s;hall we doubt the Credit of Men, who&s;e Company (for their Credit be it &s;poken) a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was proud of gaining?</P>
<P>The Third Story is told by <HI>Luther</HI> him&s;elf, who began the great Work of the Reformation.</P>
<P>The Fourth is told by one that was a King's publick Mini&s;ter, and told from his own Trial of the matter where he could have no Intere&s;t in the telling it.</P>
<P>The Fifth is related by tho&s;e great Hi&s;to|rians, the Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> as a Truth rely'd upon by them&s;elves, and fit to be credited by their Readers.</P>

<P>Men who will not believe &s;uch things, as the&s;e, &s;o well atte&s;ted to us, and given us by &s;uch Authorities, becau&s;e they did not &s;ee them them&s;elves, nor any thing of the like Nature, ought not only to deny the <HI>Demon</HI>

Mean while all Men, but tho&s;e, who run &s;uch Lengths in their fanta&s;tical Incredulity, will, from the Facts above-mentioned, re&s;t &s;atisfied, that there are &s;uch things as evil and good <HI>Genit,</HI> and that Men have &s;ometimes a Com|merce with them by all their Sen&s;es, parti|cularly tho&s;e of <HI>&s;eeing</HI> and <HI>hearing,</HI> and will not therefore be &s;tartled at the &s;trange Frag|ments of Hi&s;tories, which I am going to re|late of our young <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> and look upon &s;ome wonderful Adventures which he perform'd by the Intervention of his familiar <HI>Demon</HI> or <HI>Genius,</HI> as Fal&s;hoods, only becau&s;e they are uncommon and &s;urprizing, more e|&s;pecially &s;ince they were not done in a corner, but by an open way of Profe&s;&s;ion of a predi|ctor of Things, in the Face of the Metropolis of <HI>London,</HI> where he &s;ettled Young, as will appear in the Progre&s;s of his Life. However, &s;ome People, notwith&s;tanding all this, may al|ledge, that though a Man may have a <HI>Genius</HI> appear to him, &s;o as to convey into his Mind, through his Sen&s;es, the knowledge of things that are to come to pa&s;s, yet this happens, but on very eminent and extraordinary Occa|&s;ions. The Murder for Example of a prime
<PB N="102" REF="128">
Mini&s;ter, and the Favourite of a Monarch, in &s;uch a manner as it was perform'd on the Great <HI>Buckingham,</HI> by <HI>Felton,</HI> was a thing &s;o uncommon, that it might perhaps de&s;erve, by the Permi&s;&s;ion of Heaven, an uncommon Prediction: The others likewi&s;e are In&s;tances Eminent in their way, particularly that of the Lady <HI>Everard</HI>'s Niece; For that young Lady being then Marriageable, and a Trea|ty for that end being on Foot with Sir <HI>Wil|liam Perkins;</HI> the Divine Providence fore|&s;eeing that &s;uch a State might call away her Thoughts, hitherto bent on him and &s;piritual Affairs, and fix them on the Trifles of this World, might perhaps permit her to be cal|led by a holy Mother to the State of Hap|pine&s;s, &s;he before her enjoy'd, lea&s;t her Daugh|ter's Mind &s;hould change, and &s;he go into the Ways of a Sinner. But if the&s;e Super|eminent, the&s;e &s;carce and rare Examples, may be admitted of Man's holding a Conver&s;a|tion with the &s;piritualiz'd Beings of another World; it will however be far below the Dignity of humane Rea&s;on methinks, to make &s;uch large Conce&s;&s;ions to People, who pre|tend to Conver&s;e that wonderful way, as to allow them the Credit of being able to do it upon every &s;light Occa&s;ion, and every in|different Occurrence of human Life.</P>
<P>I cannot help acknowledging, that a Man of Wi&s;dom may, at fir&s;t Thought, make &s;uch an Objection; but Reflection will pre&s;ently
<PB N="103" REF="129">

<P>Infants may have no doubt the Benefit of &s;uch an attending <HI>Genius,</HI> as well as People more advanc'd in Years; as may be &s;een in one of the In&s;tances, which is a very famous one, relating to the Boy Born in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> who was attended by one con&s;tantly from the Time of his Birth to his Death. Be&s;ides it is a mi&s;take in the Under&s;tanding, to im|magin, that Death, which is the determina|tion and end of Life, is of more Con&s;equence to be known than the manner of regulating that Life; for in reality, according to the right way of con&s;idering, Death, or the de|termination of a Man's Life, derives its Im|portance from the Steps which he took in the due regulation of it; and therefore e|very the lea&s;t Step, proper to be taken for the due regulation of Life, is of more Con|&s;equence to be known, than the Death of a Per&s;on, though this at fir&s;t &s;ight carries the Face of Significance, and the other no|thing better than the look of a Trifle. Mar|riage for example is a Step in Life of the utmo&s;t Importance, whether we con&s;ider that E&s;tate with regard to this, or the next World. Death is but the fini&s;hing of one Per&s;on, but Marriage may be the introducing of many into the World with Happine&s;s; it is there|fore
<PB N="104" REF="130">
a thing of more importance to be known before-hand, and con&s;equently more worthy of the communication of a <HI>Genius</HI> to the Man with whom he convers'd. <HI>Po&s;&s;idonius</HI> tells us, that a certain <HI>Rhodian</HI> dying, nominated Six of his equals, and &s;aid who &s;hould die fir&s;t, who next, and &s;o on, and the event an|&s;wer'd the Prediction; why then (tho' &s;ome People are apt to make a Je&s;t of it) may not a Man by the intervention of his good <HI>Ge|nius,</HI> tell a Woman, that is to have Six Hu&s;|bands, who &s;he &s;hall have fir&s;t, who next, and &s;o on, and the event an&s;wer the Predi|ction? If Men of Learning may acquire &s;uch Knowledge, as to attain to extraordinary Things by their ordinary Faculties, why may not ordinary Things be taught others in this extraordinary way? For will any-body &s;ay that it is ea&s;ier for a Man to accommodate him&s;elf to the knowledge of a <HI>Demon</HI> or <HI>Ge|nius,</HI> than for a <HI>Demon</HI> or <HI>Genius</HI> to accom|modate him&s;elf to the Knowledge of a Man? Certain it is indeed that if this good <HI>Genius</HI> (that induces a Man with a prophetick kind of Science) be any thing re&s;embling a good Angel, the <HI>primary end</HI> of his being permitted to direct Mankind, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in Things re|lating more to their Welfare hereafter; yet I know not why they may not &s;ometimes in|&s;pire, or openly direct them in human Know|ledge, and in things relating to human Life, &s;o they are of a good Tendency; more e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="105" REF="131">
&s;ince &s;uch a good In&s;piration may be a counterballance to the bad Knowledge which &s;ome have been in&s;pir'd with by evil Spirits. I would not be thought to go too far in a Point of this Nature, and have therefore (though perhaps I could &s;ay much more if I follow'd entirely my own private Opinion, and would venture to introduce it here, in Order to com|municate it to others, and make it a publick one) &s;aid no more on this Head than what Divines generally teach.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t unxeceptionable Mi&s;tre&s;s, that teaches the&s;e Things to be in Nature, is Ex|perience. If we had very many People gifted this way, the extraordinary Thing would have been become ordinary, and therefore I can't help wondering that it &s;hould be &s;o ordinary a Thing for wi&s;e Men them&s;elves to wonder too much at Things, becau&s;e they are extra|ordinary, and &s;u&s;pect them as Frauds, becau&s;e they are uncommon.</P>
<P>There has &s;carce been any period of Time in which &s;ome Per&s;on of this prophetick Cla&s;s has not exi&s;ted, and has not been con&s;ulted by the greate&s;t of Men, and their Predictions found at the long run to come true; ignorant Men always ri&s;e to their Belief of them by Experience, and the mo&s;t learned Men &s;ub|mit their great Opinions to Experience, but your Men of <HI>midling Talents,</HI> who make up their want of Rea&s;on with bu&s;tling Ob&s;tinacy and noi&s;y Contradiction, have been and &s;till
<PB N="106" REF="132">
continue to be their own Oppo&s;ers, and with|out di&s;covering the rea&s;on for what they &s;ay, they content them&s;elves with having the laugh on their &s;ides, and barely affirming without proving, that it is a kind of <HI>ideal Juggle</HI> and <HI>intellectual Legerdemain,</HI> by which the&s;e mo|dern Predictors impo&s;e things upon the Eye of Rea&s;on, as the corporeal Eye is impos'd upon by &s;light of Hand; but it is a &s;trange thing that Men of &s;uch quick Rea&s;on can't give us a Sample of the Frauds. Thus I re|member to have read (I can't tell where) a Story of &s;ome Courtiers, who, when a great Arti&s;t of <HI>Legerdemain</HI> was to act before the King, pretended to be &s;o quick &s;ighted, that nothing he did &s;hould e&s;cape their Di&s;covery, were left by his nimble Fingers in the Dark, and forc'd at la&s;t with Blu&s;hes to own they had no better Eyes than other People. In a Word, if People will be led by Su&s;picions and re|mote po&s;&s;ibilities of Fraud and Contrivance of &s;uch Men, all Hi&s;torical Truth &s;hall be ended, when it con&s;i&s;ts not with a Man's private Humour or Prejudice to admit it. Now therefore to prove by Experience and un|deniable Te&s;timonies, that the&s;e kind of <HI>Genii</HI> will &s;ubmit to little Offices in order to bring Men to greater Good; I will give the Reader Three or Four curious Pa&s;&s;ages, that will &s;et the rea&s;onable Reader at ea&s;e, and prepare him for reading the Pa&s;&s;ages of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Life with Plea&s;ure, and as a fine Hi&s;tory of won|derful

Facts, that though they &s;eem to &s;ur|pa&s;s Belief, yet ought to have his Credit.</P>
<P>What in Nature can be more trivial than for a Spirit to employ him&s;elf in knocking on a Morning at the Wain&s;cot by the Beds-head of a Man who got drunk over Night, ac|cording to the way that &s;uch things are or|dinarily explain'd? And yet I &s;hall give you &s;uch a Relation of this, that not even the mo&s;t devout and preci&s;e <HI>Presbyterian</HI> will offer to call in Que&s;tion. For Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in his Hi|&s;torical Di&s;cour&s;e of Apparitions writes thus.</P>
<P>There is now in <HI>London</HI> an under&s;tanding &s;ober pious Man, oft one of my Hearers, who has an elder Brother, a Gentleman of con|&s;iderable Rank, who having formerly &s;eem'd Pious, of late Years does often fall into the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s; he often Lodges long to|gether here in his Brother's Hou&s;e; and when|&s;oever he is Drunk and has &s;lept him&s;elf So|ber, &s;omething knocks at his Bed's-head, as if one knock'd on a Wain&s;cot: When they remove his Bed it follows him: Be&s;ides other loud Noi&s;es, on other Parts where he is, that all the Hou&s;e hears, they have often watch'd him, and kept his Hands lea&s;t he &s;hould do it him&s;elf: His Brother has often told it me, and brought his Wife a di&s;creet Woman to atte&s;t it; who avers moreover, that as &s;he watch'd him, &s;he has &s;een his Shoes under the Bed taken up, and nothing Vi&s;ible to touch them. They brought the Man him&s;elf
<PB N="108" REF="134">
to me, and when we ask'd him, how he dare Sin again after &s;uch a warning, he had no ex|cu&s;e: But being Per&s;ons of Quality, for &s;ome &s;pecial Rea&s;on of worldly Intere&s;t I mu&s;t not name him.</P>
<P>Two things are remarkable in this In&s;tance. (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> What a powerful thing Temptation and fle&s;hly Concupi&s;cence is, and what an harden'd Heart Sin brings Men to; if one ro&s;e from the Dead to warn &s;uch Sin|ners, it would not of it&s;elf per&s;wade them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) It Po&s;es me to think what kind of <HI>Spirit</HI> this is, that has &s;uch a care of this Man's Soul, which makes me hope he will Recover. Do good <HI>Spirits</HI> dwell &s;o near us, or are they &s;ent on &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages? Or is it his Guardian Angel? Or is it the Soul of &s;ome dead Friend that Suf|fers? and yet retaining Love to him as <HI>Dives</HI> to his Brethren would have him &s;aved? God yet keeps &s;uch things from us in the Dark.</P>
<P>So far we have the Authority of the re|nown'd and famous Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> who makes this knocking of the <HI>Spirit</HI> at the Bed's-head (though what we commonly call frivolous) an important Errand.</P>
<P>Another Relation of this kind was &s;ent to Mr. <HI>John Beaumont</HI> (whom I my&s;elf per&s;onally know and which he has in&s;erted in his Ac|count of <HI>Genit</HI> or <HI>familiar Spirits</HI>) in a Letter by an ingenious and learned Clergy-man of <HI>Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hire</HI>&punc; who had given him the Relation
<PB N="109" REF="135">
likewi&s;e before by Word of Mouth. It is as follows.</P>
<P>Near Eighty Years &s;ince, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Wilcot</HI> (which is by the Devizes) in the Vi|car's Hou&s;e, there was heard for a con&s;ide|rable Time the &s;ound of a Bell, con&s;tantly tolling every Night; the occa&s;ion was this: A debauch'd Per&s;on who liv'd in the Pari&s;h, came one Night very late and demanded the Keys of the Church, of the Vicar, that he might ring a Peal, which the Vicar refus'd to let him have, alledging the un&s;ea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Time, and that he &s;hould by grant|ing his De&s;ires give a di&s;turbance to Sir <HI>George Wroughton</HI> and his Family, who&s;e Hou&s;e ad|joined to the Church-yard. Upon this refu|&s;al the Fellow went away in a Rage, threat|ning to be reveng'd of the Vicar, and going &s;ome time after to the Devizes, met with one <HI>Cantle</HI> or <HI>Cantlow,</HI> a Per&s;on <HI>noted</HI> in tho&s;e Days for a <HI>Wizard;</HI> and he tells him how the Vicar had &s;erv'd him, and begs his help to be even with him. The Reply <HI>Cantel</HI> made him was this; does he not love ring|ing? He &s;hall have enough of it: And from that Time a Bell began to Toll in his Hou&s;e, and continued &s;o to do till <HI>Cantell</HI>'s Death, who confe&s;s'd at <HI>Fi&s;herton</HI> Goal in <HI>Sarum,</HI> (where he was confin'd by King <HI>James</HI> du|ring his Life) that he caus'd that Sound, and that it &s;hould be heard in that Place during Life. The Thing was &s;o notorious, that
<PB N="110" REF="136">
Per&s;ons came from all Parts to hear it. And King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent a Gentleman from <HI>London,</HI> on purpo&s;e to give him Satisfaction concern|ing the Truth of the Report. Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> had likewi&s;e this Story as he tells from the Mouth of Sir <HI>George Wroughton</HI>'s own Son; with this remarkable Circum&s;tance, that if any in the Hou&s;e put their Heads out of the Window, they could not hear the Sound, but heard it immediately again as &s;oon as they &s;tood in the Room.</P>
<P>The Reader here &s;ees that good and bad <HI>Genit</HI> exerci&s;e them&s;elves upon very little Functions, knocking at Bed's-heads, and ring|ing of Bells. For Proof of this we have the Te&s;timonies of Two Divines, of a Man of Quality and Probity, and the &s;ame Satisfa|ction that a learned King had, who &s;ent to inquire into the matter; and after this there can be I think no room for Doubt.</P>
<P>But to carry the Point &s;till nearer Home; Ina&s;much as I know &s;ome will leave no Stone unturn'd, to make the extraordinary Actions, which the Per&s;on, who&s;e Life I write, has perform'd, appear Impo&s;tures, and ina&s;much as for this End they may &s;ay, that though many People may have been gifted in this extraordinary manner, yet not &s;o as to make a Profe&s;&s;ion of it, and therefore from thence they take their Su&s;picions, I &s;hall in this Place to remove every nice&s;t Scruple they can have touching this Affair, give the Reader one
<PB N="111" REF="137">
In&s;tance of this kind likewi&s;e, before I pro|ceed with my Hi&s;tory,</P>
<P>There lived not many Years &s;ince a very aged Gentlewoman, in <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>Water-lane,</HI> by <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Pight,</HI> who was endow'd with a prophetick <HI>Spirit:</HI> And the ingenious Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> (whom I per&s;o|nally knew and who had a familiar <HI>Genius</HI> him&s;elf) gives the World this Account of her. She was very well known (&s;ays he) to many Per&s;ons of my Acquaintance now living in <HI>London.</HI> Among others, a Gentleman, who&s;e Candour I can no way &s;u&s;pect, has told me, that he often re&s;orted to her, as to an Oracle; and that a&s;&s;oon as he came into her Pre&s;ence, &s;he would u&s;ually tell him, that &s;he knew what he was coming for, for that &s;he had &s;een his <HI>Spirit</HI> for &s;ome Time before: And without his &s;aying any thing to her, &s;he would com|monly tell him what the Bu&s;ine&s;s was, which he came to con&s;ult her about, and what the Event of it would be; which he always found to fall out as &s;he &s;aid, and many other Per|&s;ons now living can te&s;tify the like Experience of her as to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this Chapter, I am wil|ling to give the Publick one further little Hi|&s;tory of the like kind with the foregoing ones, with this only difference, that if it be valued according to the worth the World has al|ways attributed to the very ingenious Per&s;on whom it concerns, it will be far the mo&s;t fa|mous

of them all, and therefore fitte&s;t to fi|ni&s;h this Chapter, and to crown this part of the Work, in which we are &s;howing that Per&s;ons have had a Perception of <HI>Genii</HI> or <HI>Spirits,</HI> not vi&s;ible at the &s;ame time to others.</P>

V.</HI> who, in his Preface, tells us, that, in what he writ, he has follow|ed chiefly the Hi&s;tory given us in <HI>Italian</HI> by <HI>John Bapti&s;ta Man&s;o,</HI> a <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Gentleman, who had been a very <HI>intimate</HI> Friend to <HI>Ta&s;|&s;o.</HI> In his Life, among other things, he ac|quaints us, that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> was naturally of that melancholick Temperament, which has al|ways made the greate&s;t Men, and that this Temperament being aggravated by many Hard&s;hips he had undergone, it made him &s;ometimes <HI>be&s;ide him&s;elf,</HI> and that tho&s;e me|lancholick Vapors being di&s;patched, he came again to him&s;elf, like tho&s;e, that return from Fits of the falling Sickne&s;s, his <HI>Spirit</HI> being as free as before. That, near his latter End, he retired from the City of <HI>Naples,</HI> to his Friend <HI>Man&s;o,</HI> at <HI>Bi&s;accia,</HI> a &s;mall Town in
<PB N="113" REF="139">
the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> where <HI>Man&s;o</HI> had a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, and pa&s;&s;ed an <HI>Autumn</HI> there in the Diver&s;ions of the Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>And here the <HI>French</HI> Author gives us an Account of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s &s;en&s;ible Perception of a <HI>Genius</HI> as follows. As, after the&s;e Amu&s;e|ments, he u&s;ually retired to his Chamber, to entertain him&s;elf there with his Friend <HI>Man&s;o,</HI> the latter had the opportunity to inquire into one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular Effects of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI>'s Melancholy, (of this <HI>heroick Melancholy,</HI> as I may call it) which rai&s;ed and brightened his <HI>Spirit,</HI> &s;o far it was from depre&s;&s;ing or rend|ring it ob&s;cure; and which, among the An|cients, would have rea&s;onably caus'd them, to have a&s;cribed a <HI>familiar Demon</HI> to him, as to <HI>Socrates.</HI> They were often in a warm de|bate, concerning this <HI>Spirit,</HI> with which <HI>Ta&s;|&s;o</HI> pretended to have &s;o free a Communica|tion. I'm too much your Friend, &s;aid <HI>Man&s;o,</HI> to him, one Day, not to let you know, what the World thinks of you, concerning this thing, and what I think of it my&s;elf. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that, being inlightened as you are, you &s;hould be fall'n into &s;o great a Weakne&s;s, as to think you have a <HI>familiar Spirit;</HI> and will you give your Enemies that advantage, to be able to prove by your own acknowledg|ment, what they have already publi&s;hed to the World? You know they &s;ay, you did not publi&s;h your <HI>Dialogue of the Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> as a <HI>fiction;</HI> but you would have Men believe,
<PB N="114" REF="140">
that the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which you make to &s;peak there, was a <HI>real</HI> and <HI>true Spirit:</HI> Hence Men have drawn this injurious Con&s;equence, that your Studies have <HI>embroil'd</HI> your Imagina|tion, &s;o that there is made in it a <HI>confu&s;ed mixture</HI> of the Fictions of the <HI>Poets,</HI> the In|ventions of the <HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> and the Doctrine of <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>I am not ignorant, an&s;wer'd <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> of all that is &s;pread abroad in the World, on the account of my <HI>Dialogue:</HI> I have taken care divers Times to di&s;-abu&s;e my Friends, both by Letter and Word of Mouth: I prevented ev'n the Malignity of my Enemies, as you know, at the Time I publi&s;h'd my <HI>Dialogue.</HI> Men could not be ignorant that I compos'd it for the young Prince of <HI>Mantua,</HI> to whom I would explain, after an agreeable manner, the principal My&s;teries of the Platonick Phi|lo&s;ophy. It was at <HI>Mantua</HI> it&s;elf, after my Second Flight from <HI>Ferrara,</HI> that I form'd the <HI>Idea</HI> of it, and I committed it to Paper a lit|tle after my unfortunate Return. I addre&s;s'd it to this Prince, and all Men might have read in the <HI>Epi&s;tle Dedicatory,</HI> the Prote&s;tation I there make, that this <HI>Dialogue</HI> being writ according to the Doctrine of the <HI>Platonicks,</HI> which is not always conformable to reveal'd Truths; Men mu&s;t not confound what I ex|po&s;e there as a <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> with what I be|lieve as a <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI> This di&s;tinction is by &s;o much the more rea&s;onable, that at that Time
<PB N="115" REF="141">
nothing extraordinary had happened to me, and I &s;pake not of any <HI>Apparition.</HI> This can be atte&s;ted by all tho&s;e with whom I lodged or whom frequented in this Voyage; and there|fore there is no rea&s;on for confounding the Fi|ction of my <HI>Dialogue,</HI> with what has happen'd to me &s;ince. I am per&s;waded of all you &s;ay to me, reply'd <HI>Man&s;o,</HI> but truly I cannot be of what you believe, at pre&s;ent, concerning your|&s;elf. Will you imagin, that you are in Com|merce with a <HI>Spirit?</HI> And I ask you of what Order is that <HI>Spirit?</HI> Shall we place him in the number of the Rebels, whom their Pride precipitated into the <HI>Aby&s;s?</HI> Or of the Intel|ligences, who continued firm in Faith and Submi&s;&s;ion to their Creator? For there is no mean to take in the true Religion, and we mu&s;t not fall into the extravagances of the <HI>Gnomes</HI> and <HI>Silphs</HI> of the <HI>Cabali&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Spirit</HI> in Que&s;tion cannot be a <HI>Demon:</HI> You own that in&s;tead of in&s;piring you any thing contrary to Piety and Religion, he often fortifies in you the Maxims of Chri|&s;tianity; he &s;trengthens your Faith by pro|found rea&s;onings, and has the &s;ame Re&s;pect with you for &s;acred Names and Things, Nei|ther can you &s;ay that it's an <HI>Angel;</HI> for, tho' you have always led a regular Life, and far from all Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s; tho' for &s;ome Years pa&s;t you have apply'd your&s;elf, after a par|ticular manner, to the Duties of a true Chri|&s;tian, you will agree with me, that the&s;e &s;orts
<PB N="116" REF="142">
of Favors are not common; that a Man mu&s;t have attained to a high degree of Sanctity, and not be far from the purene&s;s of Cele&s;tial <HI>Spirits,</HI> to merit a familiar Conver&s;e, and bear a Harmony with them. Believe me there is nothing in all the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, which you imagin you have with this <HI>Spirit.</HI> You know, better than any Man, tho&s;e Symptoms, which the black Humours, wherewith you are tor|mented, cau&s;es in you.

If it were true that the <HI>Spirit</HI> did not &s;hew him&s;elf to me, but in the violent a&s;&s;ault of my Vapours: If he offer'd to my Immagi|nation, but wandring and confus'd <HI>Species,</HI> without Connection or due Sequel; if he us'd to me frivolous rea&s;onings, which ended in nothing; or it having begun &s;ome &s;olid rea|&s;oning, he broke it off on a &s;udden, and left me in Darkne&s;s, I &s;hould believe with you, that all things, that pa&s;s, are but mere Dreams

<P>TO proceed on regularly with the Life of young <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> I mu&s;t let the Reader know that he continued thus con|ver&s;ing with his little <HI>Genius,</HI> as is &s;et forth above in the Dialogue he had with me, and predicting many things of the like Nature, as I have de&s;cribed, till the Year 1694. when he was ju&s;t Fourteen Years of Age, and then he left <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But before I come to &s;peak of the manner of his departure from thence, his half native Country, ina&s;much as his Father was of that Country, and he had his Education there. (what Education he could have being Deaf and Dumb) I mu&s;t let the Reader know that in the Year 1692. my very good Friend Mrs. <HI>Campbell,</HI> his Mother in Law, died, and left
<PB N="125" REF="151">
him there at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> an Orphan of Twelve Years of Age.</P>
<P>He was, I may venture to &s;ay, the mo&s;t beautiful Boy of that Age I ever knew; and the &s;en&s;ible Reader, who con&s;iders a Child of good Birth, with the Misfortunes of being Deaf and Dumb, left Fatherle&s;s and Mother|le&s;s in the wide World, at Twelve Years Old, without any Competency for his Maintain|ance and Support, without any Relations, in a manner, that knew him or a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, all the little Fortune, his Father had, having been lo&s;t in the civil Commotions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I have related above, need not hear me de&s;cribe the Compa&s;&s;ion, I, and many more, had for him; becau&s;e &s;uch a Reader mu&s;t certainly feel in his own Bo&s;om the &s;ame live|ly Acts of Pity and Commi&s;eration, at the hearing of &s;uch a Mi&s;hap, as I had at the &s;ee|ing it, or at lea&s;t as I have now reviv'd a|fre&s;h within me at the relating it.</P>
<P>However, it came &s;o to pa&s;s, that a Per&s;on of the Name of <HI>Campbell,</HI> and who was a di|&s;tant Relation of the Boy, though he him&s;elf was but in indifferent Circum&s;tances, was re&s;olv'd to &s;ee him provided for one way or another, in a manner &s;omewhat &s;uitable to his Condition, and till that Time to take the be&s;t care of him him&s;elf, that he was able.</P>
<P>Several Ladies of Quality, who had known his Perfections, coveted to make the Boy one of their Dome&s;ticks, as a Page, or a Play|fellow

to their Children; for though he could not &s;peak, he had &s;uch a Vivacity in all his Actions, &s;uch a &s;prightline&s;s of Behaviour, and &s;uch a Merriment accompanying all his Ge&s;tures, that he afforded more Entertain|ment, than the prettie&s;t and wittie&s;t little Pratlers at tho&s;e Years are wont to do. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had certainly accepted of &s;ome of the&s;e fortunate Offers for his little Cou&s;in, which were many of them likely to prove very Advantageous, if it had not been put in his Head by &s;ome Friends, particularly my&s;elf, that if he had a mind to di&s;po&s;e of the Boy in that manner, the be&s;t way he could take, would be, to pre&s;ent him to the late Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who for his Name &s;ake, and for his Father's &s;ake, as well as the Qualifications and Endowments of the Boy, would more naturally (according to all Pro|bability) take a greater plea&s;ure and delight in him, and con&s;equently provide better for him, and with a more la&s;ting Care, than any other Per&s;on of Quality, that had a &s;udden liking to him which might change, and took him as a Stranger out of a bare Cu|rio&s;ity. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> was by the&s;e Rea&s;ons over-rul'd in the di&s;po&s;al of his little Dumb Prophetical Cou&s;in, as he call'd him, and re|&s;olv'd that an Offer &s;hould be made of him to the pre&s;ent illu&s;trious Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s mo&s;t noble Father.

<P>I had now left him for near Three Years, not having &s;een him, &s;ince about a Year after his Mother's Death; and then coming to <HI>London,</HI> I had by mere accident an Appoint|ment to meet &s;ome <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentlemen at the <HI>Buffalo</HI> at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s.</HI> There happen'd at that Time to be a great Concour&s;e of <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobility there at an Entertainment, and one of the Ladies and Gentlemen pa&s;&s;ing by and &s;eeing one of my Friends, de&s;ir'd him to come in, and told him both he and his Compani|ons &s;hould be very welcome to partake of the Diver&s;ion. The Lady told him they had got a lovely Youth, a <HI>Scotch</HI> Miracle among them, that would give us exqui&s;ite Delight, and write down to us all the Occurrences of our future Lives, and tell us our Names upon our fir&s;t Appearance. The Moment I heard of it, <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> came into my Head; but as it is a thing not rare to be met with in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for Second &s;ighted Per&s;ons to tell &s;uch things, and as the Earl of <HI>Angyle</HI> was
<PB N="128" REF="154">
in the North, I thought little <HI>Duncan</HI> had been under his Protection and with him, and did not dream of meeting with him there, and accordingly told my Friend, before I went in, that I believed I knew a Lad in <HI>Scotland</HI> would exceed this in Fore-&s;ight, let him be as dexterous in his Art as he would.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I enter'd the Room, I was &s;ur|priz'd to find my&s;elf encompa&s;s'd and &s;ur|rounded by a Circle of the mo&s;t beautiful Fe|males that ever my Eyes beheld. In the Centre of this Angelick Tribe was &s;eated a heavenly Youth, with the mo&s;t winning comeline&s;s of A&s;pect, that ever plea&s;ed the Sight of any Be|holder of either Sex; his Face was divinely Fair, and ting'd only with &s;uch a &s;prightly Blu&s;h, as a Painter would u&s;e to Colour the Picture of Health with, and the Complexion was varni&s;h'd over by a blooming, like that of flouri&s;hing Fruit, which had not yet felt the fir&s;t Nippings of an unkind and an uncivil Air; with this Beauty was join'd &s;uch a &s;miling draught of all the Features, as is the re&s;ult of Plea&s;antry and good Humour. His Eyes were large, full of Lu&s;tre, Maje&s;tick, well &s;et, and the Soul &s;hone &s;o in them, as told the Spectators plainly, how great was the in|ward Vivacity of his <HI>Genius:</HI> The Hair of his Head was thick and reclin'd far below his Shoulders; it was of a fine Silver Colour, and hung down in Ringlets like the curling Tendrils of a copious Vine. He was by the
<PB N="129" REF="155">
Women entertain'd, according to the Claim, which &s;o many Perfections joining in a Youth ju&s;t ripening into Manhood, might lay to the benevolent Di&s;po&s;itions of the tender Sex. One was holding the Ba&s;on of Water, ano|ther wa&s;hing a Hand, a Third with a Towel drying his Face, which another Fair had gree|dily &s;natch'd the Plea&s;ure of wa&s;hing before, while a Forth was di&s;po&s;ing into order his Silver Hairs with an Ivory Comb, in an Hand as White, and which a Monarch might have been proud to have had &s;o employ'd in adju|&s;ting the Crown upon his Head; a Fifth was &s;etting into Order his Crevat; a Sixth &s;tole a Ki&s;s, and blu&s;h'd at the innocent Plea&s;ure, and mi&s;took her own Thoughts as if &s;he ki&s;s'd the Angel and not the Man; and they all ra|ther &s;eem'd to adore than to love him, as if they had taken him not for a Per&s;on that en|joy'd the frequent Gift of the Second Sight, but as if he had been &s;ome little Prophet pe|culiarly in&s;pired, and while they all thus ad|mired and wonder'd they all con&s;ulted him as an Oracle. The &s;urprize of &s;eeing a young Man &s;o happy amid&s;t the general concurring Favours of the Fair, made me be for a while lo&s;t in a kind of delightful Amazement, and the con&s;ideration of what Bli&s;s he was po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd, made me &s;carce believe my own Eyes, when they told me it was <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> who I had left an unhappy Orphan at <HI>Edin|burgh.</HI> But &s;o it was, though he was much

<P>The fir&s;t remarkable thing I knew him do in <HI>London,</HI> being in this &s;plendid Company, where there were &s;o many undoubted Wit|ne&s;&s;es of Quality too, that had ocular Proof of his Predictions at that publick Tavern: I chu&s;e to Record it here in the fir&s;t Place, according to its due Order. It was in the Year 1698.</P>
<P>Among this Angelical Cla&s;s of Beauties, were Dr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lw<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI>'s Lady and Daughter. Upon Earth there was not &s;ure a more beau|tiful Creature than the Daughter was; &s;he was the leading Light of all the &s;parkling Tribe; and <HI>Otway</HI>'s Character &s;uits her ex|actly; for &s;he was <HI>among Ten Thou&s;and emi|nently Fair.</HI> One would imagin pro&s;perous and lucky Fortune was written upon her Face, and that nothing unhappy could be read in &s;o fair a Book; and it was therefore the unani|mous Con&s;ent of all, that, by way of good Omen to the re&s;t, his Predictions &s;hould be|gin to be open'd luckily that Day, and that therefore he &s;hould fir&s;t of all be con&s;ulted a|bout her.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Mother to be &s;atisfied of his Talent, before &s;he proceeded to any o|ther
<PB N="131" REF="157">
Que&s;tions, ask'd him in writing if he knew the young Lady, her Name, and who &s;he was. After a little ruminating and pon|dering upon the matter, and taking an exact View of the Beauty, he wrote down her Name, told Mrs. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lw<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI> &s;he was her Daugh|ter, and that her Father was a Doctor. Con|vinced by his &s;o readily telling the Name and Quality of Per&s;ons he had never &s;een in his Life-time, that Fame had not given a fal&s;e Character of his Capacity, &s;he proceeded in her Que&s;tions as to her future Fortune. He gaz'd a fre&s;h at her very eagerly for &s;ome time, and his Countenance during that time of viewing her &s;eem'd to be rufled with a|bundance of Di&s;turbance and Perplexity. We all imagin'd that the Youth was a little touch'd at the Heart him&s;elf with what he &s;aw, and that in&s;tead of telling hers, he had met in her bright Eyes with his own De&s;tiny, the De&s;tiny of being for ever made a Slave and a Captive, to &s;o many powerful and al|mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table Charms.</P>
<P>At length, after having a long Debate within him&s;elf, which we thought proceed|ed from the &s;truglings of Love and Pa&s;&s;ion, he fetching a great Sigh, which &s;till con|vinced us more, took the Pen and wrote to Mrs. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lw<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d,</HI> that he beg'd to be excus'd, and that his Pen might remain as Dumb and Silent as his Tongue, on that Affair. By this An&s;wer we concluded one and all,
<PB N="132" REF="158">
that our former Conjectures were true, and we join'd in pre&s;&s;ing him the more earne&s;tly to deliver his real and &s;incere Opinion con|cerning the Accidents upon which the future Fortunes of her Life were to turn and de|pend. He &s;hew'd many mighty Reluctances in the doing it; and I have often &s;ince con|&s;idered him in the &s;ame Angui&s;h as the late great Dr. <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> who was endeavouring by Study to &s;ave a certain fair One, whom he lov'd with a vehemence of Temper, and who was (as his Rea&s;on told him) got far away beyond the reach of the Art of Phy&s;ick to recover. At la&s;t he wrote in plain Terms, that his backwardne&s;s and unwillingne&s;s to tell it, aro&s;e from his wi&s;hes that her For|tune would be better than his certain Fore|knowledge of it told him it would be, and beg'd that we would re&s;t &s;atisfied with that general An&s;wer, &s;ince it was in &s;o particular a Ca&s;e, where he him&s;elf was a well-wi&s;her, in vain, to the Lady about whom he was con&s;ulted. The young Lady her&s;elf thinking, that, if &s;he knew any Di&s;a&s;ters, that were to befal her, &s;he might by knowing the nature of them beforehand, and the time when they were likely to happen, be able by timely Prudence and Foreca&s;t to avert tho&s;e Evils; with many be&s;eechings, urg'd him to reveal the fatal Secret. After many &s;truggles to a|void it, and as many In&s;tances made to him, both by Mother and Daughter, for the di&s;|covery
<PB N="133" REF="159">
of his Pre&s;cience in that Point, he comply'd with very great difficulty, and blot|ting the Paper with Tears that trickled fa&s;t from his Eyes, he gave her the lamentable Scroll, containing the Words that follow, <HI>viz.</HI> I wi&s;h it had not fallen to my Lot to tell this Lady, whom every Body, that but once looks at her, mu&s;t admire, though they mu&s;t not have leave to love, that &s;he is not much longer to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of that lovely Face, which gains her &s;uch a number of Adorers. The &s;mall Pox will too &s;oon turn a Ravi&s;her, and rifle all tho&s;e Sweets and Charms that might be able to vanqui&s;h a King, and to &s;ubdue a Conqueror of mighty Battles. Her Reign is doom'd ala&s;s to be as &s;hort as it is now Great and Univer&s;al: I believe &s;he has interval Beauties of the Mind, not the lea&s;t inferior to tho&s;e external Excellencies of the Body, and &s;he might perhaps by the power of her Mind alone, be ab&s;olute Queen of the Affections of Men, if the &s;mall Pox threaten'd not too &s;urely to be her further Enemy, and, not contented to de&s;troy the Face, was not perver&s;ely bent to de&s;troy the whole Woman. But I want Words to ex|pre&s;s my Sorrow.&mdash;I would not tell it, if you did not extort the baneful Secret from my Bo&s;om.&mdash;This fair Creature, who&s;e Beauty would make one wi&s;h her Immortal, will by the cruel means of the &s;mall Pox, give us too &s;udden a Proof of her Mortality.&mdash;But nei|ther
<PB N="134" REF="160">
the Mother nor her&s;elf ought too much too repine at this, &s;eeing it appears to be the Decree of Providence, which is always to be interpreted, as meant for our Good, and &s;ee|ing it may be the means of tran&s;lating her the &s;ooner only to her kindered Angels, who&s;e Beauty &s;he &s;o much re&s;embles here on Earth, and to be among the lowe&s;t Cla&s;s, of whom is better than being the greate&s;t Beauty of the World here below, and wearing an Imperial Crown.&mdash;While I comfort you, I can't help the force of Nature, which makes me grieve my&s;elf, and I only give you, becau&s;e you com|pel me to it, &s;o particular and &s;o exact an An&s;wer, to &s;o particular and &s;o exacting a Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Mother, who took the Paper, was prudent enough to conceal from the Daugh|ter, what he &s;aid, but Nature would force its way, and bubled from her Eyes; and the Daughter perceiving that, pre&s;s'd hard to &s;ee it, and wept at the con&s;ideration that hard Fate (though &s;he knew not particularly what way) was to befal her. Never &s;urely was any thing &s;o beautiful in Tears, and I obtain'd of the Mother to &s;ee the Writing.&mdash;At la&s;t, in general Terms, to free her from a &s;u&s;pen&s;e of Mind, it was told her that &s;ome Trouble &s;hould happen to her that would dimini&s;h her Beauty. She had Courage enough to hear that Misfortune with di&s;dain, and crying, if that be all, I am arm'd, I dont place much
<PB N="135" REF="161">
Pride in that, which I know Age mu&s;t &s;hortly after de&s;troy, if Trouble did not do it be|fore; and &s;he dry'd up her Tears, and (if what Mr. <HI>Bruyere</HI> &s;ays be true, <HI>viz.</HI> that the la&s;t thing a celebrated Woman thinks of when &s;he dies, is the lo&s;s of her Beauty) &s;he &s;hew'd an admirable Pattern of female Philo&s;ophy, in bearing &s;uch a cruel Prediction with &s;uch un&s;peakable Magnanimity, as exceeded even the Patience of &s;tern Stoi&s;m, con&s;idering &s;he was a Woman, to whom Beauty is more dear than Life.</P>
<P>If any Evil, that is impending over Peo|ples Heads, could be evaded by Fore-know|ledge, or eluded by Art, &s;he had the faire&s;t opportunity of having this Prediction annul|led (which would have been more to the &s;a|tisfaction of the Predictor than knowing it verified) than ever any Woman had. Her Mother was &s;pecifically told, that the fatal Di|&s;temper &s;hould be the &s;mall Pox; her Father was, and is &s;till, a very Eminent Phy&s;ician; and Di&s;tempers of that kind, e&s;pecially, are much more ea&s;ily prevented, by Care, than cur'd by Art, and by Art more ea&s;ily &s;et a|&s;ide, when there is a timely warning given to a Phy&s;ician to prepare the Body again&s;t the danger of the Poi&s;on, than when the Di|&s;temper has once catch'd hold of a Body at unawares, when it is unpurg'd of any gro&s;s Humours that may accompany it. But nei|ther the Fore-knowledge and Caution of the
<PB N="136" REF="162">
Mother, nor the Skill and Wi&s;dom of the great Phy&s;ician her Father, were &s;ufficient to ward off the approaching Harm, that was written in the Books of Fate. Not many Suns had fini&s;hed their yearly Cour&s;es, be|fore &s;he was forc'd to &s;ubmit to the inevi|table Stroak of Death, after the infectious and malicious Malady had fir&s;t ravag'd her Beauty, rioted in all her Sweets, and made an odious deform'd Spectacle of the Charmer of Mankind. The Death of the Daughter work'd hard upon the Mother's Bowels, and dragg'd her &s;peedily after her, with a broken Heart to the Grave.</P>
<P>This Lady, who&s;e Fortune &s;o great and &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd an A&s;&s;embly had cho&s;en to hear as a happy Fore-runner and lucky Omen of all their own, which were to be ask'd after|wards in their turns, proving &s;o contrary to their Expectations already unfortunate in the Prediction, and having been in Tears about the matter di&s;hearten'd all the re&s;t of the Beauties from con&s;ulting him further that Day. The Per&s;on, who kept the Tavern, by Name Mrs. <HI>Irwin,</HI> alledg'd that as &s;ome People were very fortunate and others un|fortunate upon the &s;ame Day; &s;o one Lady might be before told a mi&s;hap one Mi|nute, and another Lady all the Pro&s;perity in Nature the very next Minute following, and therefore that what the unfortunate Lady had heard was not to be taken as Ominous, or
<PB N="137" REF="163">
as what could Malignantly influence the Day, neither ought it to be the lea&s;t hinderance to any who had the curio&s;ity of being let into the Secrets of Time before-hand. However, whether the Ladies were convinc'd or no; if &s;he prevail'd over their Belief in that Point, &s;he could not prevail over their Humour, which (though they might not believe the former Prediction ominous to them&s;elves) was naturally aw'd for fear of the like, per|adventure, for a Time, and &s;o it was agreed, <HI>nemine Contradicente,</HI> as a witty Lady wrote it down, that no more Petitions &s;hould for that Day be pre&s;ented by any of that Com|pany to his Dumb, yet oracular, Maje&s;ty. Mrs. <HI>Irwin,</HI> however, would have her way; &s;aid &s;he did not pre&s;ume to &s;uch Honour as to call her&s;elf of that Company, and that therefore &s;he might con&s;ult him without breaking through the Votes of the A&s;&s;embly. Many endeavour'd to di&s;&s;wade her, but as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of knowing future E|vents; and had a mighty itch to be very in|qui&s;itive with the Oracle, about what might happen, not only to her&s;elf, but her Po&s;teri|ty; it was agreed that he &s;hould have the liberty of &s;atisfying her Curio&s;ity, &s;ince &s;he pre&s;um'd her Fortune was &s;ure to be &s;o Good, and was &s;o forward and eager for the know|ledge of it. But (ala&s;s!) &s;uch is too often the fanta&s;tical Impul&s;e of Nature unluckily depraved, that it carries often into wi&s;hes of
<PB N="138" REF="164">
knowing, what when known we would be glad to unknow again, and then our Memory will not let us be untaught.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Irwin</HI> was at that time in a pretty commodious way of Bu&s;ine&s;s, every thing in Plenty round about her, and liv'd more like a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, that kept &s;uch a Cel|lar of Wine, open Hou&s;e, and a free Table, than like one who kept a Tavern. She brought in her Three pretty Children, that were then almo&s;t Babies, the younge&s;t having not long been out of the Nur&s;es Arms, or tru&s;ted to the u&s;e of its own Legs. The&s;e Children &s;he lov'd as a Mother &s;hould love Children; they were the delight of her Eyes all Day, and the Dream of her Imagination all Night. All the Pa&s;&s;ions of her Soul were confin'd to them; &s;he was never pleas'd but when they were &s;o, and always angry if they were cro&s;s'd; her whole Pride was centered in them, and they were cloath'd and went attended more like the Infants of a Prince&s;s, than of a Vintner's Relict. The Fortune of the&s;e was what &s;he had near at Heart, and of which &s;he was &s;o eager of being immediately apprized. Her Impatience was proportiona|ble to the love &s;he had for them, and which made her wi&s;h to fore-know all the Happine&s;s that was like to attend them. She &s;ate chear|fully down, pre&s;ented one to him, and &s;mil|ing wrote the Que&s;tion in general Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> is this Boy to be Happy or Unhappy.
<PB N="139" REF="165">
A melancholy Look once more &s;pread it&s;elf all over the Face of the Predictor, when he read the too inqui&s;itive Words, and he &s;eem'd mightily to regret being ask'd a Que&s;tion, to which he was by his Talent of fore-&s;eeing, compell'd to give &s;o unwelcome an An&s;wer. The Colour of the poor Woman flu&s;h'd and vani&s;h'd alternately, and very quick, and &s;he look'd not quite like the Picture of De&s;pair, but a di&s;con&s;olate Woman, with little Hopes on one Hand, and great Doubts and di&s;mal Fears on the other. She profe&s;s'd &s;he read great Evil in the Troubles of his Face, thank'd him for his good nature, told him, that they all knew, that though he could fore-tell, he could not alter the acts and decretals of Fate, and therefore de&s;ir'd him to tell her the wor&s;t; for that the Misfortunes, were they never &s;o great, would be le&s;s dreadful to her, than re|maining in the State of Fear and Su&s;pen&s;ion. He at la&s;t wrote down to her that great and unexpected and even unavoidable Accidents would involve the whole Family in new Ca|lamities, that the Son &s;he ask'd him about would have the bittere&s;t task of Hard&s;hip to go through withal, while he lived, and that to fini&s;h all more unhappily, he would be ba&s;ely and maliciou&s;ly brought to an untimely End, by &s;ome mortal Enemy or other, but that &s;he &s;hould not trouble her&s;elf &s;o much on that head, &s;he would never &s;ee it, for it would happen &s;ome Years after &s;he was de|parted
<PB N="140" REF="166">
from the World. This melancholy Account clos'd up the Book of Predictions for that Day, and put a &s;ad &s;top to all the pro|jected Mirth and Curio&s;ity. Now I mu&s;t tell the Reader how and when the event an&s;wer'd the Prediction. And in a few Words it was thus; poor Mrs. <HI>Irwin,</HI> by &s;trange Accidents decay'd in the World, and dying Poor, her Sons were forc'd to be put out Apprentices to &s;mall Trades, and the Son, whom the above|mentioned Prediction concern'd, was, for &s;tealing one Chee&s;e from a Man in the <HI>Hay|market,</HI> &s;everely pro&s;ecuted at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> and on Wedne&s;day the Twenty Third of <HI>De|cember,</HI> 1713. hang'd at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> with &s;everal other Criminals.</P>
<P>The Two foregoing Pa&s;&s;ages are of &s;o tra|gical a Nature, that it is time I &s;hould re|lieve the Minds of my Readers, with &s;ome Hi&s;tories of Ladies, who con&s;ulted him with more Succe&s;s and Advantage, to whom his Predictions were very entertaining, when they &s;o came to pa&s;s in their Favour, the Relation whereof, will con&s;equently be agreeable to all Readers, who have within them a mixture of happy Curio&s;ity and good Nature.</P>
<P>Two Ladies, who were the mo&s;t remarka|ble Beauties in <HI>London,</HI> and the mo&s;t courted, turn'd at the &s;ame time their Thoughts to Matrimony, and being &s;atiated, I may &s;ay, wearied with the Plea&s;ure, of having conti|nually after them a great number and variety
<PB N="141" REF="167">
of Adorers, re&s;olv'd each, about the &s;ame time, to make a choice of their &s;everal Men, to whom, they thought, they could give mo&s;t Happine&s;s, and from whom they might re|ceive mo&s;t. Their Names (for they are both Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction) &s;hall be <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> and <HI>Urbana. Chri&s;tallina</HI> was a Virgin, and <HI>Urbana</HI> a young Widow. <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> engro&s;s'd the Eyes, the Hearts, and the Sighs, of the whole Court, and wherever &s;he appeared, put any Court Lady out of her Place, that had one before in the Heart of any Youth; and was the celebrated Toa&s;t among the <HI>Beau Monde. Urbana</HI>'s Beauty made as terrible Havock in the City: All the Citizens Daugh|ters, that had many Admirers, and were in fair Hopes of having Husbands, when they pleas'd them&s;elves; a&s;&s;oon as <HI>Urbana</HI> had lo&s;t her old Husband, found that they every Day lo&s;t their Lovers, and 'twas a general fear a|mong the prettie&s;t Maids, that they &s;hould remain Maids &s;till, as long as <HI>Urbana</HI> remain'd a Widow. She was the Monopolizer of City Affection, and made many Girls, that had large &s;tocks of Suiters, Bankrupts in the Trade of Court&s;hip, and broke &s;ome of their Hearts, when her Charms broke off their Amours.&mdash;Well but the Day was near at Hand, when both the <HI>Belles</HI> of the Court and the City Dam&s;els were to be freed from the ravages, which the&s;e Two Tyrants, triumphant in Beauty, and in&s;olent in Charms, made among
<PB N="142" REF="168">
the Harve&s;t of Love. Each had &s;een her proper Man, to whom the Enjoyment of her Per&s;on was to be dedicated for Life. But it being an Affair of &s;o la&s;ting Importance, each had a mind to be let into the knowledge of the con&s;equences of &s;uch a Choice, as far as po&s;&s;ible, before they &s;tep'd into the irrevo|cable State of Matrimony. Both of them happen'd to take it into their Heads, that the be&s;t way to be entirely &s;atisfied in their Cu|rio&s;ity, was to have recour&s;e to the great Pre|dictor of future Occurrences, Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> who&s;e Fame was at that Time &s;pread pretty largely about the Town. <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> and <HI>Urbana,</HI> were not acquainted with each other, only by the report which Fame had made of Beauty. They came to Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s on the &s;ame Day, and both with the &s;ame re&s;olution of keeping them&s;elves con|ceal'd and under Masks, that none of the Company of Con&s;ulters, who happen'd to be there, might know who they were. It hap|pened that on that very Day, ju&s;t when they came, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Rooms were more than ordinarily crowded, with curious Clients of the fair Sex, &s;o that he was oblig'd to de&s;ire the&s;e Two Ladies, who expre&s;s'd &s;o much precaution again&s;t, and fear of having their Per&s;ons di&s;cover'd, to be contented with only one Room between them, and with much ado, they comply'd with the reque&s;t, and conde&s;cended to &s;it together <HI>Incog.</HI> Di&s;tant
<PB N="143" REF="169">
Compliments of Ge&s;ture pa&s;s'd between them, (the dre&s;s and comportment of each making them appear to be Per&s;ons of Figure and Breed|ing) and after Three or Four modi&s;h Curte|&s;ies down they &s;at, without &s;o much as once opening their Lips, or intending &s;o to do. The Silence between them was very formal and profound for near half an Hour, and nothing was to be heard but the &s;napping of Fans, which they both did very tuneably and with great Harmony, and plaid, as it were in Con|&s;ort.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one of the <HI>civil well bred Mutes,</HI> happening to <HI>Sneeze,</HI> the other very gracefully bow'd, and before &s;he was well aware, out popp'd the Words&mdash;Ble&s;s you Madam, the fair Sneezer return'd the Bow, with an&mdash;I thank you Madam. They found they did not know one another's Voices; and they began to talk very merrily together, with pretty great confidence, and they taking a mutual liking from Conver&s;ation, &s;o much familiarity grew thereupon in&s;tantly between them, that they began not only to unmask, but to unbo&s;om them&s;elves to one another, and confe&s;s alternately all their Secrets. <HI>Chri|&s;tallina</HI> own'd who &s;he was, and told <HI>Urbana</HI> the Beau and Courtier that had her Heart. <HI>Urbana</HI> as franckly declared that &s;he was a Widow, that &s;he would not become the La|dies Rival, that &s;he had pitch'd upon a Se|cond Husband, an Alderman of the City.
<PB N="144" REF="170">
Ju&s;t by that time they had had their chat out, and wi&s;h'd one another the plea&s;ure of a &s;ucce&s;sful Prediction, it came to <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI>'s turn to vi&s;it the Dumb Gentleman, and re|ceive from his Pen oracular An&s;wers, to all the Que&s;tions &s;he had to propo&s;e. Well, he accordingly &s;atisfied her in every Point &s;he ask'd him about; but while &s;he was about this; one of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Family going with <HI>Urbana</HI> to divert her a little: The Widow railed at the Virgin as a Fool, to immagin that &s;he &s;hould ever make a Conque&s;t of the brighte&s;t Spark about the Court, and then let &s;he &s;ome random bolts of Malice to wound her Reputation for Cha&s;tity: Now it became the Widow's turn to go and con&s;ult: And the &s;ame Per&s;on of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Family, in the mean time entertain'd <HI>Chri&s;tallina.</HI> The Maid was not behind hand with the Widow; &s;he rail'd again&s;t the Widow, repre&s;ented her as &s;ometimes a Coquette, &s;ometimes a Lady of Plea&s;ure, &s;ometimes a Jilt, and lifted up her Hands in Wonder and Amazement, that <HI>Urbana</HI> &s;hould immagin &s;o rich a Man, as an Alderman, <HI>&s;uch a one,</HI> &s;hould fall to her Lot. Thus <HI>Urbana</HI> &s;wore and prote&s;ted that <HI>Chri|&s;tallina</HI> could never arrive at the Honour of being the Wife to the courtly <HI>Secretarius,</HI> let Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> flatter her as he would; and <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> vow'd, that <HI>Campbell</HI> mu&s;t be a downright <HI>Wizard,</HI> if he foretold, that &s;uch a one as <HI>Urbana</HI> would get Alderman <HI>Stiff|rump</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="171">
for a Husband, provided a Thing &s;o im|probable &s;hould come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>However, it &s;eems, <HI>Duncan</HI> had told them their own Names and the Names of their Suiters, and told them further, how &s;oon they were both to be married, and that too directly to their Heart's content, as they &s;aid rejoicing|ly to them&s;elves, and made their mutual Gra|tulations.</P>
<P>They went away each &s;atisfied, that &s;he &s;hould have her own Lover, but <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> laugh'd at Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> for a&s;&s;igning the Al|derman to <HI>Urbana;</HI> and <HI>Urbana</HI> laugh'd at him for promi&s;ing the Courtier to the Arms of <HI>Chri&s;tallina.</HI></P>
<P>This is a pretty good Figure of the Tem|pers of Two reigning Toa&s;ts, with regard to one another.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Their Curio&s;ity made them, from re&s;olving to be concealed, di&s;cover one ano|ther wilfully, from utter Strangers grow as familiar as old Friends in a Moment, &s;wear one another to Secrecy, and exchange the Sentiments of their Hearts together, and from being Friends become envious of each o|ther's enjoying a Similitude of Happine&s;s; the Compliments made on either &s;ide Face to Face, were, upon the turning of the Back, turn'd into Reflections, Detraction, and Ridi|cule; each was a Self-lover and Admirer of her own Beauty and Merit, and a De&s;pi&s;er of the other's.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="172">
However, <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> proved at la&s;t to be in the right; <HI>Urbana</HI> was wrong in her opinion of <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI>'s want of power over <HI>Secretarius,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> was as much out in her opinion, that <HI>Urbana</HI> would mi&s;s in her aim of obtaining <HI>Stiffrump:</HI> For they both prov'd in the right of what they thought, with regard to their own dear &s;ingle Per&s;ons, and were made happy according to their Ex|pectations, ju&s;t at the time foretold by Mr. <HI>Campbell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI>'s ill Wi&s;hes did not hinder <HI>Ur|bana</HI> from being Mi&s;tre&s;s of Alderman <HI>Stiff|rump</HI>'s Per&s;on and Stock, nor did <HI>Urbana</HI>'s hinder <HI>Chri&s;tallina</HI> from &s;hewing her&s;elf a &s;hining Bride at the Ring in <HI>Secretarius</HI>'s gil|ded Chariot, drawn by Six Prancers of the proud <HI>Belgian</HI> Kind, with her half dozen of Liveries, with Favours in their Hats, wait|ing her return at the Gate of <HI>Hyde-park.</HI></P>
<P>Both lov'd and both envy'd, but both al|low'd of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Fore-knowledge.</P>
<P>Having told you Two very &s;orrowful Pa&s;|&s;ages, and one tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful and enter|taining; I &s;hall now relate to you another of my own knowledge, that is mix'd up with the Grievous and the Plea&s;ant, and checquer'd, as it were, with the Shade and the Sun-&s;hine of Fortune.</P>
<P>Though there are Vici&s;&s;itudes in every Stage or Life under the Sun; and not one ever ran continually on with the &s;ame &s;eries
<PB N="147" REF="173">
of Pro&s;perity; yet tho&s;e Conditions, which are the mo&s;t liable to the &s;ignal Alterations of Fortune, are the Conditions of Merchants; for profe&s;t Game&s;ters I reckon in a manner as Men of no condition of Life at all; but what comes under the Statute of Vagabonds.</P>
<P>It was indeed, as the Reader would gue&s;s, a worthy and a wealthy Merchant, who was to run through the&s;e different Circum&s;tances of Being. He came and vi&s;ited our Mr. <HI>Camp|bell,</HI> in the Year, 1707. he found him amid&s;t a Croud of Con&s;ulters; and being very ea|ger and &s;olicitous to know his own Fortune, ju&s;t at that critical juncture of time, he begg'd of him (if po&s;&s;ible) to adjourn his other Clients to the Day following, and &s;acrifice that one wholly to his u&s;e; which as it was probably more important than all the others together, &s;o he wrote down that he would render the time &s;pent about it more advantagious to Mr. <HI>Campbell;</HI> and, by way of previous En|couragement, threw him down Ten Guineas as a retaining Fee.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> who held Money in very lit|tle e&s;teem, and valued it &s;o much too little, that he has often had my Reprehen&s;ions on that head, pau&s;ed a little, and after looking earne&s;tly in the Gentleman's Face, and read|ing there, as I &s;uppo&s;e, in that little &s;pace of time in general, according to the power of the Second Sight, that what concern'd him was highly momentous, wrote him this An|&s;wer,
<PB N="148" REF="174">
that he would comply with his reque&s;ts, adjourn his other Clients to the Day follow|ing, and &s;et apart all the remnant of that, till Night, for in&s;pecting the future Occur|rences, of which he had a mind to be made a Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>There is certainly a very keen Appetite in Curio&s;ity: It cannot &s;tay for &s;atisfaction; it is pre&s;&s;ing for its nece&s;&s;ary repa&s;t, and is with|out all patience: Hunger and Thir&s;t are not Appetites more vehement and more hard and difficult to be repre&s;s'd, than that of Curio|&s;ity: Nothing but the <HI>pre&s;ent Now</HI> is able to allay it. A more expre&s;&s;ive Picture of this I never beheld, than in the Faces of &s;ome, and the murmurs and complaints of others, in that little inqui&s;itive Company, when the unwelcome Note was given about &s;ignifying an Adjournment, for only Twenty Four Hours.</P>
<P>The Colour of a young Woman there, came and went a Hundred times (if po&s;&s;ible) in the &s;pace of Two Minutes; &s;he blu&s;h'd like a red Ro&s;e this Moment, and in the &s;witch of an Eye-la&s;h &s;he was all over as pale as a white one: The Suiter, who&s;e Name, her Heart had gone pit a pat for the &s;pace of an Hour, to be inform'd of from the Pen of a Seer, was now deferr'd a whole Day longer; &s;he was once or twice within an ace of &s;wooning a|way; but he comforted her in particular, by telling her (though he &s;aid it only by way of
<PB N="149" REF="175">
je&s;t) that the Day following would be a more lucky Day to con&s;ult about Husbands, than the pre&s;ent, that &s;he came on. The An&s;wer was a kind of Cordial to her hopes, and brought her a little better to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Two others, (I remember) Si&s;ters and old Maids, that it &s;eems were Mi&s;ers, Women ordinarily dre&s;t, and in blue Aprons, and yet by relation worth no le&s;s than Two Thou&s;and Pounds each, were in a peck of Troubles a|bout his going and leaving them un&s;atisfied. They came upon an enquiry after Goods that were &s;tolen, and they complained that by next Morning at that time, the Thief might be got far enough off, and creep into &s;o remote a corner, that he would put it beyond the power of the Devil, and the art of Conjura|tion to find him out, and bring him back a|gain. The di&s;turbance and anxiety that was to be &s;een in their Conntenances, was ju&s;t like that, which is to be beheld in the Face of a great lo&s;ing Game&s;ter, when his all, his la&s;t great Stake, lies upon the Table, and is ju&s;t &s;weeping off by another winning Hand into his own Hat.</P>
<P>The next was a Widow, who boune'd, be|cau&s;e, as &s;he pretended, he would not tell her what was be&s;t to do with her Sons, and what Profe&s;&s;ion it would be mo&s;t happy for them to be put to; but in reality all the Cau&s;e of the Widow's fuming and fretting, was, not that &s;he wanted to provide for her
<PB N="150" REF="176">
Sons, but for her&s;elf; &s;he wanted a Second Husband, and was not half &s;o &s;olicitous about being put in a way of educating tho&s;e Child|ren &s;he had already, as of knowing when &s;he &s;hould be in a likelyhood of getting more. This was certainly in her Thoughts, or el&s;e &s;he would never have flounc'd about in her Weed, from one end of the Room to the o|ther, and all the while of her Pa&s;&s;ion &s;mile by Fits upon the Merchant, and leer upon a young pretty <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Fellow that was there. The young <HI>Iri&s;h-man</HI> made u&s;e of a little Eye|language: She grew appeas'd, went away in quite a good humour, skutled too airily down Stairs, for a Woman in her cloaths, and the rea&s;on was certainly that &s;he knew the mat|ter before, which we took notice of pre&s;ently after: The <HI>Iri&s;h-man</HI> went precipitately after her down Stairs without taking his leave.</P>
<P>But neither were the Two Mi&s;ers for their Gold, the Virgin for a fir&s;t Husband, nor the Widow for a Second, half &s;o eager, as ano|ther married Woman there, was for the death of her Spou&s;e. She had put the Que&s;tion in &s;o expecting a manner for a lucky An&s;wer, and with &s;o much keen de&s;ire appearing plain|ly in her looks; that no big belly'd Woman was ever more eager for devouring Fruit; no young ha&s;ty Bridegroom, ju&s;t married to a Beauty, more impatient for Night and En|joyment, than &s;he was to know, what &s;he thought a more happy Moment, the Moment
<PB N="151" REF="177">
of her Husband's la&s;t agonizing Ga&s;p. As her Expectation was the greate&s;t, &s;o was her Di&s;|appointment too, and con&s;equently her Di&s;|order upon his going and leaving her unre|&s;olv'd. She was frantick, raging and impla|cable; &s;he was in &s;uch a Fury at the delay of putting off her An&s;wer to the Day following, that in her fury, &s;he acted as if &s;he would have given her&s;elf an An&s;wer, which of the Two &s;hould die fir&s;t, by choaking her&s;elf upon the &s;pot, with the Indignation that &s;well'd in her Stomach, and ro&s;e into her Throat on that oc|ca&s;ion. It may look like a Romance to &s;ay it; but indeed they were forc'd to cut her Lace, and then &s;he threw out of the Room with great Pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But yet had &s;o much of the enraged Wife left, (beyond the enrag'd Wo|man) as to return in&s;tantly up Stairs, and &s;ignify very calmly, &s;he would be certain to be there next Day, and be&s;eech'd earne&s;tly that &s;he might not meet with a Second Di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>All this hurry and bu&s;tle created a &s;tay, a little too tedious for the Merchant, who be|gan to be impatient him&s;elf, e&s;pecially when Word was brought up, that a fre&s;h Company was come in: But Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> was deny'd to them; and to put a &s;top to any more In|terruptions, the Merchant and the dumb Gentleman agreed to &s;lip into a Coach, drive to a Tavern in the City, and &s;ettle matters of Futurity over a Bottle of <HI>French</HI> Claret.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="178">
The fir&s;t Thing done at the Tavern, was Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s &s;aluting him upon a piece of Paper by his Name, and drinking his Health. The next Paper held a Di&s;cour&s;e of condo|leance for a Di&s;a&s;ter that was pa&s;t long &s;ince, namely a great and con&s;iderable lo&s;s that hap|pen'd to his Family, in the dreadful Confla|gration of the City of <HI>London.</HI> In the Third little Dialogue which they had together, he told the Merchant that Lo&s;&s;es and Advan|tages were general Topicks, which a Per&s;on unskill'd in that Art might venture to a&s;&s;ign to any Man of his Profe&s;&s;ion; it being next to impo&s;&s;ible that Per&s;ons who traffick &s;hould not &s;ometimes gain, and &s;ometimes lo&s;e.&mdash;But &s;aid Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> I will sketch out particularly, and &s;pecify to you &s;ome fu|ture Misfortunes, with which you will una|voidably meet: 'Tis in your Stars, it is in De&s;tiny that you &s;hould have &s;ome Trials, and therefore when you are forewarn'd take a prudent care to before-arm'd with Patience, and by longanimity, and meekly, and re&s;ig|nedly, enduring your Lot, render it more ea&s;y, &s;ince Impatience can't avert it, and will only render it more burthen&s;ome and heavy. He gave the&s;e Words to the Merchant; who pre&s;s'd for his Opinion that Moment. By your leave (re&s;uming the Pen &s;aid the Dumb Gentleman in writing) we will have this Bottle out fir&s;t and tap a fre&s;h one, that you may be warm'd with Courage enough to re|ceive
<PB N="153" REF="179">
the fir&s;t Speculative on&s;ett of ill fortune, that I &s;hall predict to you, with a good grace, and that may perhaps enable you to meet it, when it comes to reduce it &s;elf into action, with a manful Purpo&s;e and all becoming Re|&s;olution. The Merchant agreed to the Pro|po&s;al, and put on an Air of the carele&s;s and in|different as well as he could, to &s;ignify that he had no need to rai&s;e up an artificial Courage from the auxiliary forces of the Grape. But Nature, when hard pre&s;s'd, will break thro' all di&s;gui&s;es, and not only notwith&s;tanding the Air of Plea&s;antry he gave him&s;elf, which ap|pear'd forced and con&s;train'd, but in &s;pite of Two or Three &s;parkling and enlivening Bum|pers, a Cloud of Care would ever and anon gather and &s;hoot heavily cro&s;s his Brow, tho' he labour'd all he could to di&s;pel it as quick|ly, and to keep fair Weather in his Counte|nance. Well, they had crack'd the fir&s;t Bot|tle and the Second &s;ucceeded upon the Table, and they call'd to blow a Pipe together. This Pipe Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> found had a very ill Effect: It is certainly a pen&s;ive kind of In&s;trument; and fills a Mind any thing &s;o di&s;po&s;ed with di&s;turb|ing thoughts, black fumes, and melancholy va|pours, as certainly as it doth the Mouth with &s;moke. It plainly took away even the little Sparks of Vivacity, which the Wine had given before; &s;o he wrote for a truce of fi|ring tho&s;e &s;ort of noxious Guns any longer, and they laid down their Arms by con&s;ent, and
<PB N="154" REF="180">
drank off the Second Bottle. A Third im|mediately &s;upply'd its place, and at the fir&s;t Gla&s;s the opening of the Bottle, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> began to open to him his future ca&s;e, in the following Words. Sir, you have now &s;ome Ventures at Sea from &s;uch and &s;uch a Place to &s;uch a value. Don't he di&s;comforted at the News which you certainly will have within three Months, (but 'twill be fal&s;e at la&s;t) that they are by three different Tempe&s;ts made the Prey of the great Ocean, and enrich the Bottom of the Sea, the Palace of <HI>Neptune.</HI> A wor&s;e Storm than all the&s;e attends you at home, a Wife who is and will be more the Tempe&s;t of the Hou&s;e wherein &s;he lives. The high and lofty Winds of her Vanity will blow down the Pillars of your Hou&s;e and Family; the High-tide of her Extravagance will roll on like a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Torrent and leave you at low Water, and the Ebb of all your Fortunes. This is the Highe&s;t and the mo&s;t cutting Di&s;a&s;ter that is to befal you; your real Ship|wreck is not foreign but dome&s;tick; your bo&s;om Friend is to be your greate&s;t Foe, and even your powerful Undoer for a time; mark what I &s;ay, and take Courage, it &s;hall be but for a time, provided you take Courage; it will upon that condition be only a &s;hort and whole&s;ome ta&s;te of Adver&s;ity given to you, that you may reli&s;h returning Pro&s;perity with Virtue, and with a greater Return of thanks to him, that di&s;pen&s;es it at plea&s;ure to Man|kind.
<PB N="155" REF="181">
Remember Courage and Re&s;ignation is what I advi&s;e you to; u&s;e it (as becomes you) in your Adver&s;ity, and believe that as I foretold that Adver&s;ity, &s;o I can foretel a Pro&s;perity will again be the con&s;equence of tho&s;e Virtues; and the more you feel the one, ought not to ca&s;t you down, but rai&s;e your hopes the more, that he who foretold you that &s;o exactly, could likewi&s;e foretel you the other. The Merchant was by this put into a great &s;u&s;pence of Mind, but &s;omewhat ea|&s;ier, by the Second Prediction being annex'd &s;o kindly to the fir&s;t fatal one. They crown'd the Night with a flask of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and then parting, each went to their re&s;pective Homes.</P>
<P>The Reader may perchance wonder how I, who make no mention of my being there, (as in Truth I was not at the Tavern) &s;hould be able to relate this as of my own knowledge; but if he plea&s;es to have patience to the end of the Story, he will have entire &s;atisfaction in that Point.</P>
<P>About half a Year after, the Merchant came again, told him that his Prediction was too far verify'd, to his very dear co&s;t, and that he was now utterly undone, and beyond any vi&s;ible means of a future recovery, and doubt|ing lea&s;t the other fortunate Part of the Pre|diction was only told him by way of Encou|ragement, (for groundle&s;s Doubts and Fears always attend a Mind implung'd in Melan|choly) be&s;ought him very earne&s;tly to tell
<PB N="156" REF="182">
him candidly and &s;incerely, if there was no real Pro&s;pect of Good, and rid him at once of the Unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Thought; but pray too, &s;aid he, with all the vehemence of repeated Expo&s;tulation, &s;atisfy me, if there are any further hopes on this &s;ide the Grave?</P>
<P>To this <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> made a &s;hort, but a very &s;ignificant reply in writing. May the Heaven's pre&s;erve you from a threat'ning dan|ger of Life. Take care only of your&s;elf, great and mighty care, and if you outlive Friday next, you will yet be great and more fortunate, than ever you was in all the height of your former mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;pace of Life. He colour'd inordinately when <HI>Dun|can Campbell</HI> &s;aid Friday, and conjur'd him to tell him as particularly as he could what he meant by Friday. He told him he could not particularize any further, but that great Dan|ger threaten'd him that Day; and that with|out extraordinary Precaution, it would prove fatal to him, even to death. He &s;hook his Head, and went away in a very &s;orrowful Plight. Friday pa&s;t, Saturday came, and on that very Saturday Morning came likewi&s;e the joyful Tidings that, what Ventures of his were given over for lo&s;t, at Sea, were all come &s;afe into the Harbour. He came the Moment he receiv'd tho&s;e di&s;patches from his Agent, to Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI>'s Apartment, embrac'd him tenderly, and &s;aluted him with
<PB N="157" REF="183">
much gladne&s;s of Heart, before a great Room full of Ladies, where I happen'd to be pre|&s;ent at that time; crying out in a loud Voice, before he knew what he &s;aid, that Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had &s;av'd his Life, that Friday was his Birth-day, and he had intended with a Pi&s;tol to &s;hoot him&s;elf that very Day. The Ladies thought him mad; and he, recover'd from his Ex&s;tacy, &s;aid no more, but &s;ate down, till Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd all his Clients; and then we Three went to the Tavern together, where he told me the whole little Hi&s;tory or Narrative, ju&s;t as is above related.</P>
<P>The Fame which Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> got by the foregoing, and &s;everal other Predi|ctions of the like kind, was become very large and exten&s;ive, and had &s;pread it&s;elf into the remote&s;t Corners of this Metropolis. The Squares rung with it, it was whi&s;per'd from one Hou&s;e to another, through the more mag|nificent Streets, where Per&s;ons of Quality and Di&s;tinction re&s;ide, it catch'd every Hou&s;e in the City, like the News of Stock from <HI>Ex|change-alley,</HI> it run noi&s;ily through the Lanes and little Thorough-fares where the poor in|habit; it was the Chat of the Tea-table, and the Babble of the Streets, and the whole Town, from the top to the bottom, was full of it. Whenever any Reputation ri&s;es to a degree like this, let it be for what Art or Accompli&s;hment or on what account &s;oever it will, Malice, Envy and Detraction, are &s;ure

<P><PB N="161" REF="187">
In the Year 1701, a Lady of good Quality came and addre&s;s'd her&s;elf to him much after the following manner. She told him &s;he had Choice of Lovers, but preferr'd one above the re&s;t; but de&s;ir'd to know his Name, and if &s;he made him her Choice, what would be the &s;ub&s;equent Fate of &s;uch a Matrimony. Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> very readily gave her down in writing, this plain and hone&s;t Re|ply; that of all her Suiters, &s;he was mo&s;t in|clin'd to a Captain, a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Officer, and a great Beau, (naming his Name) and one that had a great many outward engaging Charms, &s;ufficient to blind the Eyes of any Lady that was not thoroughly acquainted with his Manner of living. He therefore a&s;|&s;ured her, (and thought him&s;elf bound, be|ing conjured, &s;o to do, having received his Fee, though there was Danger in &s;uch plain and open Predictions,) that he was a Villain and a Rogue in his Heart, a profligate Game|&s;ter, and that if &s;he took him to her Bed, &s;he would only embrace her own Ruin. The Lady's Woman, who was pre&s;ent, being in Fee with the Captain, re&s;olving to give Intelli|gence, for fear the Officer her &s;o good Friend &s;hould be di&s;appointed in the Siege: &s;lily &s;huf|fled the Papers into her Pocket, and made a Pre&s;ent of them to the military Spark. Fir'd with Indignation at the Contents, he vow'd Revenge; and in order to compa&s;s it, con|&s;pires with his female Spy about the Means.
<PB N="162" REF="188">
In fine, for fear of lo&s;ing the Lady though he quarrel'd with <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> a Method was to be found out how to &s;ecure her by the very Act of Revenge. At la&s;t it was re|&s;olv'd to di&s;cover to her, that he had found out what &s;he had been told by Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> but the Way how he had been inform'd was to remain a Secret. He did do &s;o and ended his Di&s;covery with the&s;e Words: I de&s;ire, Madam, that if I prove him an Im|po&s;tor, you would not believe a Word he &s;ays.&mdash;The Lady agreed to &s;o fair a Propo|&s;al.&mdash;Then the Captain &s;wore that he him|&s;elf would never eat a Piece of Bread more till he had made Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> eat his Words; nay he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that he would bring him to his Tongue, and make him own by Word of Mouth, that what he had written before was fal&s;e and calumnious. To which the Lady an&s;wer'd again, that, if he perform'd what he &s;aid, &s;he would be convinced. This brave military Man, however, not relying upon his own &s;ingle Valour and Prowe&s;s, to bring about &s;o miraculous a thing as the mak|ing a Per&s;on, that was dumb, to &s;peak: He took with him for this End three lu&s;ty A&s;&s;i&s;tants to combine with him in the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The Ambu&s;cade was &s;ettled to be at the Five Bells Tavern in <HI>Witch-&s;treet</HI> in the <HI>Strand.</HI> After the Ambu&s;h was &s;ettled with &s;o much fal&s;e Courage the Bu&s;ine&s;s of decoying Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> into it, was not practicable any other way,
<PB N="163" REF="189">
than by &s;ending out fal&s;e Colours. The La|dy's Woman, who was by her own Intere&s;t tied fa&s;t to the Intere&s;t of the Beau, was to play the trick of <HI>Dalila,</HI> and betray this deaf and dumb <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> (as he will appear to be a kind of one in the &s;equel of the Story) into the Hands of the&s;e <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> She &s;mooths her Face over with a complimenting Lye from her Mi&s;tre&s;s to Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> and acted her Part of Deceit &s;o well that he promis'd to follow her to the Five Bells with all ha&s;te; and &s;o &s;he skuttled back to prepare the Cap|tain, and to tell him how lucky &s;he was in Mi&s;chief; and how &s;he drew him out by Smiles into Perdition. The &s;hort of the Story is, when they got him in among them, they endeavour'd to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; but they mi&s;s'd of their Aim; yet 'tis certain they le&s;t him in a very terrible and bloody Condition; and the Captain went away in as bad a Plight as the Per&s;on was left in, whom he a&s;&s;aulted &s;o cowardly with Numbers, and to &s;uch Di&s;ad|vantage. I was &s;ent for to him upon this Di&s;a&s;ter, and the Story was deliver'd to me thus, by one of the Drawers of the Tavern, when I inquir'd into it. They began to ban|ter him, and &s;peaking to him as if he heard, ask'd him if he knew his own Fortune; they told him it was to be beaten to Death. This was an odd way of addre&s;&s;ing a deaf and dumb Man. They added they would make him &s;peak before they had done. The Boy

&s;eeing he made no Reply, but only &s;miled; thought what pa&s;s'd between them was a Je&s;t, with an old Acquaintance, and withdrew a|bout his Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Door being fa&s;ten'd, however, before they began the honourable Attack they vouch&s;afed to write down their Intent, in the Words above-mentioned which they had uttered before, to make &s;ure that he &s;hould under&s;tand their meaning, and what this odd way of Correction was for. All the while the Maid, who had brought him into it, was peeping through a Hole, and watch|ing the Event, as appears afterwards. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> wrote them the following An&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI> that he hop'd for fair Play; that he un|der&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">d <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r-garden</HI> as well as they; but if a Gentleman was among&s;t them, he would expect gentlemanly U&s;age. The Rejoinder they made to this, con&s;i&s;ted it &s;eems not of Words but of Action. The Officer in Con|junction with another Ruffian, one of the &s;tronge&s;t of the Three he had brought, com|menced the A&s;&s;ault. As good luck would have it, he warded off their fir&s;t Blows (it &s;eems) with tolerable Succe&s;s, and a Wine|quart-pot &s;tanding upon the Table, <HI>Duncan</HI> took to his Arms, and at Two or Three quick Blows, well manag'd, and clo&s;e laid in upon the A&s;&s;ailants, fell'd them both to the Ground. Here it was that the Maid di&s;cover'd her Knowledge of it, and Privity to the Plot, to the whole Hou&s;e; for the no &s;ooner &s;ees the

famous Leader, the valiant Captain, lie &s;prau|ling on the Floor with bleeding Temples, but &s;he &s;hriek'd out, with all the Voice &s;he could exert, Murder, Murder, Murder! Alarm'd at this Out-cry, the Ma&s;ter and all the At|tendants of the Tavern &s;camper'd up Stairs, bur&s;t into the Room, and found <HI>Duncan Camp|bell</HI> &s;truggling with the other Two, and the Quart-pot &s;till fa&s;t clench'd in his Hand, which they were endeavouring to wrench from him. The Drawers re&s;cu'd him out of their Hands, and inquir'd into the Matter. The Maid in a fright confe&s;s'd the whole Thing. The Officer and his A&s;&s;ociate rub'd their Eyes as recovering from a &s;tunning Sleep, reel'd as they went to ri&s;e, paid the Reckoning, and &s;lunk pitifully away, (or as the Rakes Term for it is,) they bru&s;h'd off, and for all their Odds had the wor&s;t of the Lay. I who had &s;ome Authority with Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> by rea&s;on of my Years, and the &s;trict Acquaintance I had with his Mother, when I came and found him in that pickle, and had the whole Relation told me by the People of the Hou&s;e, though I could not forbear pitying him within my own Mind, took upon me to reprehend him, and told him that the&s;e Hard|&s;hips would by Providence be daily permitted to fall upon him (for he met with them Twenty Times) while he continued in that irregular way of Living and &s;pending his Time, that might be &s;o precious to him&s;elf

and many others, in Drunkenne&s;s and De|bauchery; and I think the Le&s;&s;ons I wrote down to him upon that Head, though a lit|tle &s;evere ju&s;t at that juncture, were notwith|&s;tanding well tim'd, and did, as I gue&s;s'd they would, make a more &s;olid Impre&s;&s;ion in him than at any other. In all the&s;e Scuffles (whether it is that being deaf and dumb an Affront works deeper upon a Man, and &s;o renders him far more fierce or re&s;olute) it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that, though Nature has been kind in making him very Strong, Robu&s;t, and Active with all, yet he has bore &s;ome Shocks, one would imagin beyond the Strength of a Man, having &s;ometimes got the better of Five or Six Ru&s;&s;ians in Rencounters of the like kind.</P>
<P>The next Banter he met with was in a gentler way, from an unbelieving Lady, and yet &s;he came off with very ill &s;ucce&s;s, and the Banter turn'd all upon her&s;elf in the End.</P>
<P>A Lady of Di&s;tinction (who&s;e Name &s;hall therefore be conceal'd in this Place) came with Two or Three of her &s;pecial Friends, who took her for the mo&s;t merry innocent &s;potle&s;s Virgin upon Earth, and who&s;e Mo|de&s;ty was never &s;u&s;pected in the lea&s;t by her Relations or Servants that were neare&s;t a|bout here after having rally'd Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal frivolous Que&s;tions, doubting his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and vexing and teazing him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> beyond all Patience, was

by him told, that he did not take Fees in his Profe&s;&s;ion to be made a Je&s;t of like a common Fortune-teller, but to do real Good to tho&s;e who con&s;ulted him, as far as he was able by his Predictions; that he was treated with more Re&s;pect by Per&s;ons of a higher Condition, though her own was very good, and &s;o of|fer'd her Guinea back again with a Bow and a Smile. She had a little more Genero&s;ity of Spirit than not to be a little nettled at the Proffer &s;he had caus'd by &s;o coar&s;e an U&s;age. She affected appearing grave a little, and told him &s;he would be &s;erious for the future, and ask'd him to &s;et down her Name, which &s;he had neglected before, to ask other Que&s;tions that were nothing to the purpo&s;e. He pro|mis'd to write it down, but pau&s;ing a little longer than ordinary about it, &s;he return'd to her former way of uncivil Merriment and ungallant Raillery. She repeated to him in Three or Four little &s;craps of Paper one after another as fa&s;t as &s;he could write them, the &s;ame Words, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;That he could not tell her Name, nor whether &s;he was Maid, Wife, or Widow; and laugh'd as if &s;he would &s;plit her Sides, triumphing to the re&s;t of her Com|panions, over his Ignorance and her own Wit, as if &s;he had pos'd him and put him to an entire Stand. But &s;ee what this over-ween|ing Opinion of Security ended in: The Man of the Second Sight, was not to be &s;o ea&s;ily baffled. Vex'd at being &s;o di&s;turb'd, and co|ming
<PB N="168" REF="194">
out of his brown Study, he reaches the Paper and begins to write.&mdash;Now it was the Lady's turn to &s;uffer, &s;he had de&s;erv'd hearty Puni&s;hment, and it came into her Hands with the Note, to a degree of Severity; (as you will perceive by the Contents of it ju&s;t now.)&mdash;She read it, and &s;wooning away, drop'd from her Chair. The whole Room being in a bu&s;tle, I that was in the outward Chamber ran in: While Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> was &s;prinkling Water in her Face, a Lady &s;natch'd up the Note to read it, at which he &s;eem'd migh|tily di&s;pleas'd; I therefore who under&s;tood his Signs recover'd it out of her Hands by Stra|tagem, and ran to burn it, which I did &s;o quick, that I was not di&s;cover'd in the Cu|rio&s;ity, which I mu&s;t own I &s;atisfied my&s;elf in, by reading it fir&s;t; a Curio&s;ity rais'd too high, by &s;o particular an Adventure, to be overcome in &s;o little a Time of Thought, as I was to keep it in my Hands, and &s;o I came by the knowledge of it my&s;elf, without being inform'd by Mr. <HI>Campbell.</HI> This &s;hews how a &s;udden Curio&s;ity, when there is not Time given to think and correct it, may overcome a Man as well as a Woman; for I was never over-curious in my Life, and though I was pleas'd with the Oddne&s;s of the Adventure, I often blu&s;h'd to my&s;elf &s;ince for the unmanly Weakne&s;s, of not being able to &s;tep with a Note, from one Room to another, to the Fire|&s;ide, without peeping into the Contents of it.
<PB N="169" REF="195">
The Contents of it were the&s;e. Madam, &s;ince you provoke me, your Name is&mdash;You are no Widow, you are no Wife, and yet you are no Maid; you have a Child at Nur&s;e at &s;uch a Place, by &s;uch a Gentleman, and you were brought to Bed in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> The Lady convinc'd by this An&s;wer, of his &s;trange and my&s;tical Power, and pleas'd with his Civility, in endeavouring to conceal from others the Secret, after &s;o many repeated Pro|vocations, though &s;he &s;hew'd great Di&s;order for that Day, became one of his con&s;tant At|tenders &s;ome time after, and would not take any Step in her Affairs, without his Advice, which &s;he often has &s;aid &s;ince, &s;he found very much to her Advantage. She was as &s;erious in her dealings with him afterwards, and im|prov'd by being &s;o, as &s;he was gay and turbu|lent with him before, and &s;marted for it. In fine, &s;he was a thorough Convert, and a Vo|tary of his; and the only Je&s;t &s;he us'd after|wards to make, concerning him, was a civil Wittici&s;m to his Wife; to whom &s;he was wont, every now and then, &s;miling, to ad|dre&s;s her&s;elf, after this manner.

<P>Not long after this came another Lady, with a like intent, to impo&s;e upon him, and was re&s;olv'd (as &s;he own'd) to have laugh'd him to &s;corn, if &s;he had &s;ucceeded in her At|tempt. She had very dexterou&s;ly dre&s;s'd her
<PB N="170" REF="196">
&s;elf in her Woman's Habit, and her Woman in her own; her Footman <HI>&s;quired</HI> the new made Lady in a very gentlemanly Dre&s;s hir'd, for that purpo&s;e of a di&s;gui&s;e, from <HI>Monmouth|&s;treet.</HI> The &s;trange and unknown Ma&s;quera|ders enter'd Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Room with much Art. The Fellow was by Nature of a clean Make, and had a good Look, and from fol|lowing a genteel Ma&s;ter, when he was young, copy'd his Gait a little, and had &s;ome Appear|ance of a Mien, and a tolerable good Air a|bout him. But this being the fir&s;t time of his being &s;o fine, and he a little vain in his Temper, he over-acted his Part; he &s;trutted too much; he was as fond of his Ruffles, his Watch, his Sword, his Cane, and his Snuff|box, as a Boy of being newly put into Breech|es; and view'd 'em all too often to be thought the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of any &s;uch things long. The Affe|ctation of the Chamber-maid was in&s;ufferable; She had the To&s;s of the Head, the Jut of the Bum, the &s;ide-long Leer of the Eye, the impe|rious Look upon her Lady, now degraded in|to her Woman, that &s;he was intolerable, and a Per&s;on without the Gift of the Second Sight, would have gue&s;s'd her to have been a prag|matical Up&s;tart, tho' 'tis very probable, that during that time, &s;he fancy'd her&s;elf real|ly better than her Mi&s;tre&s;s: The Mi&s;tre&s;s acted her Part of Maid the be&s;t, for it is ea|&s;ier for genteel Mode&s;ty to act a low Part, than for affected Vanity to act a high one. She
<PB N="171" REF="197">
kept her di&s;tance like a Servant, but would, to di&s;gui&s;e things the better, be every now and then pert, according to their Way, and give Occa&s;ion to be chid. But there is an Air of Gentility in-born and in-bred to &s;ome People, and even when they aim to be awkward, a certain Grace will attend all their minute&s;t Actions and Ge&s;tures, and command Love, Re&s;pect, and Veneration. I mu&s;t there|fore own, that there was not need of a Man's being a Conjurer, to gue&s;s who ought to be the Lady, and who the Maid; but to know who ab&s;olutely was the Lady, and who was the Maid, did require that Skill. For how many &s;uch real Ladies have we, that are made &s;o from &s;uch Up&s;tarts, and how many gen|teel waiting Women of great De&s;cent, that are born with a Grace about them, and are bred to good Manners. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Art made him po&s;itive in the Ca&s;e; he took the Patches from the Face of the Maid, and plac'd them on the Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es; he pull'd of her Hood and Scarf and gave it the Lady, and taking from the Lady her Ridinghood, gave it the Maid in exchange; for Ladies at that time of Day were not enter'd into that Fa&s;hion of cloaking them&s;elves. Then he wrote down that he &s;hould go out, and ought to &s;end his Maid in to undre&s;s them quite, and give the Mi&s;tri&s;s her own Cloaths and the Maid hers, and with a Smile wrote down both their Names and commended her contrivance; but
<PB N="172" REF="198">
after that, it was remark'd by the Lady, that he pay'd her le&s;s Re&s;pect than &s;he expected, and more to her Footman, who was in Gen|tleman's Habit, whom he took by his Side, and told a great many fine things; whereas he would tell the Lady nothing further. The Lady nettled at this, wrote to him that &s;he had Vanity enough to believe that &s;he might be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from her Maid in any Dre&s;s; but that he had &s;hown his want of Skill in not knowing who that Gentleman was. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> told her her mi&s;take in &s;harp Terms; and begging her pardon a&s;&s;ured her he knew &s;everal Chamber-maids as genteel and as well-born as her, and many Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es more aukward and wor&s;e-born than her Maid; that he did not go therefore by the Rule of gue&s;s and judging what ought to be, but by the Rule of Certainty, and the Knowledge of what actually was. She however un&s;atisfy'd with that An&s;wer perplex'd him mightily to know, who the Man was. He an&s;wer'd he would be a great Man.&mdash;The Lady laugh'd &s;cornfully, and &s;aid &s;he wanted to know who he was, not what he would be.&mdash;He an|&s;wer'd again.&mdash;He was her Footman, but that &s;he would have a wor&s;e.&mdash;She grew warm and de&s;ired to be inform'd, why, &s;ince he knew the Fellow's Condition, he re&s;pected her to little and him &s;o much; and accu&s;ed him of want of practi&s;ing Manners, if he had not went of Knowledge. He an&s;wer'd, Ma|dam,

&s;ince you will be asking Que&s;tions too far.&mdash;This Footman will advance him&s;elf to the Degree of a Gentleman, and have a Woman of Di&s;tinction to his Wife; while you will degrade your&s;elf by a Marriage to be the Wife of a Footman.

<P>This coming afterwards to pa&s;s, exactly as was predicted, and his di&s;appointing &s;o many that had a mind to impo&s;e upon him, has render'd him pretty free from &s;uch wily Con|trivances &s;ince, though now and then they have happen'd, but &s;till to the mortification and di&s;appointment of the Contrivers.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Concerning the Second Sight.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Martin</HI> lately publi&s;h'd a Book, in|tituled, <HI>A De&s;cription of the We&s;tern I&s;les of</HI> Scotland, <HI>called by the Ancient Geogra|phers Hebrides.</HI> It contains many <HI>curious</HI> Par|ticulars, relating to the natural and civil Hi|&s;tory of tho&s;e <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> with a Map of them; and in his Preface he tells us, that perhaps it's <HI>Peculiar</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>I&s;les,</HI> that they have ne|ver been de&s;cribed, till now, by any Man, that was a Native of the Country, or had travell'd them as him&s;elf has done; and in the Conclu&s;ion of the &s;aid Preface, he tells us, he has given here &s;uch an Account of the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> as the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>thing</HI> will <HI>bear,</HI> which has always been reckon'd <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> a|mong the <HI>unbya&s;s'd</HI> Part of Mankind; but for <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> that will <HI>not</HI> be <HI>&s;atisfy'd,</HI> they ought to <HI>oblige</HI> us with a <HI>new Scheme,</HI> by which we may <HI>judge</HI> of <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI> The <HI>chief Par|ticulars</HI> he has given us concerning the <HI>Se|cond Sight,</HI> are here &s;et down, by way of Ab|&s;tract or Epitome, that they may not be too tedious to the Reader.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="175" REF="201">
1. In the Second Sight the <HI>Vi&s;ion</HI> makes &s;uch a <HI>lively Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> on the <HI>Seers,</HI> that they neither <HI>&s;ee</HI> nor <HI>think</HI> of <HI>any thing el&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> as long as it continues. And then they appear <HI>Pen&s;ive</HI> or <HI>Jovial,</HI> according to the <HI>Object,</HI> which was pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the Sight of a Vi&s;ion, the Eye-lids of the Per&s;on are erected, and the Eyes continue &s;taring till the Object vani&s;h, as has often been ob&s;erv'd by the Author and others pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is one in <HI>Skye,</HI> an Acquaintance of whom ob&s;erv'd, that when he &s;ees a Vi&s;ion, the inner Part of his Eylids turns &s;o far up|wards, that, after the Object di&s;appenrs, he mu&s;t draw them down with his Fingers, and &s;ometimes employs others to draw them down, which he finds to be much the ea&s;ier way.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Faculty of the <HI>Second Sight</HI> does not lineally de&s;cend in a Family, as &s;ome ima|gin; for he knows &s;everal Parents that are endow'd with it, but not their Children; and &s;o on the contrary: Neither is it acquir'd by any previous Compact; and after a &s;trict Enquiry, he could never learn from any a|mong them, that this Faculty was commu|nicable any way what&s;oever.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That this Account is differing from the Account that is given by Mr. <HI>Aubrey,</HI> a Gentleman of the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> and I think Mr. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Rea&s;on here again&s;t the De&s;cent
<PB N="176" REF="202">
of this Faculty from Parents to Children, is not generally conclu&s;ive. For tho' he may know Parents endow'd with it, and not Chil|dren; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;;</HI> yet there may be Parents, who are endow'd with it, being qua|lify'd as Mr. <HI>Aubrey</HI> has &s;aid, (<HI>viz.</HI> both be|ing Second Sighted, or even <HI>one</HI> to an <HI>extra|ordinary</HI> Degree) who&s;e Children may have it by de&s;cent. And as to this Faculty's being any otherways communicable (&s;ince the Ac|counts differ) I mu&s;t leave it to a further Ex|amination.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Seer</HI> knows neither the Object, Time nor Place of a Vi&s;ion before it appears, and the &s;ame Object is often &s;een by different Per&s;ons, living at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another. The true Way of judging as to the Time and Circum&s;tance of an Object, is by Ob&s;ervation; for &s;everal Per&s;ons of Judge|ment without this Faculty, are more capable to judge of the De&s;ign of a Vi&s;ion, than a No|vice that is a <HI>Seer.</HI> As an Object appears in the Day or Night, it will come to pa&s;s &s;ooner or later accordingly.</P>
<P N="6">6. If an Object be &s;een early in the Morn|ing (which is not frequent) it will be accom|pli&s;h'd in a few Hours afterwards: If at Noon, it will commonly be accompli&s;h'd that very Day: If in the Evening, perhaps that Night; if after Candles be lighted, it will be accom|pli&s;h'd that Night: It's later always in Ac|compli&s;hment, by Weeks, Months, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="177" REF="203">
Years, according to the Time of the Night the Vi&s;ion is &s;een.</P>
<P N="7">7. When a Shroud is perceiv'd about one, it's a &s;ure Progno&s;tick of Death; the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it about the Per&s;on; for if it be not &s;een above the Middle, Death is not to be expected for the &s;pace of a Year, and perhaps &s;ome Months longer; and as it is frequently &s;een to a&s;cend higher towards the Head, Death is conclu|ded to be at hand in a few Days, if not Hours, as daily Experience confirms. Examples of this kind were &s;hown the Author, when the Per&s;ons, of whom the Ob&s;ervations were made, enjoy'd perfect Health.</P>
<P>There was one In&s;tance lately of a Pre|diction of this kind, by a <HI>Seer</HI> that was a Novice, concerning the Death of one of the Author's Acquaintance; this was communi|cated to a few only, and with great Confi|dence: The Author being one of the Number, did not in the lea&s;t regard it, till the Death of the Per&s;on, about the Time foretold, con|firm'd to him the certainty of the Prediction. The fore&s;aid <HI>Novice</HI> is now a <HI>&s;kilful Seer,</HI> as appears from many late In&s;tances: He lives in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, the mo&s;t Nor|thern in <HI>Skye.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. If a Woman be &s;een &s;tanding at a Man's left Hand, it's a Pre&s;age that &s;he will be his Wife, whether they are married to others, or unmarried, at the Time of the Apparition.
<PB N="178" REF="204">
If Two or Three Women are &s;een at once, &s;tanding near a Man's left Hand, &s;he that is next him will undoubtedly be his Wife fir&s;t, and &s;o on, whether all Three, or the Man, be &s;ingle, or married, at the Time of the Vi|&s;ion; of which there are &s;everal late In&s;tances of the Author's Acquaintance. It's an ordi|nary thing for them to &s;ee a Man, that is to come to the Hou&s;e &s;hortly after; and tho' he be not of the <HI>Seers</HI> Acquaintance, yet he not on|ly tells his Name, but gives &s;uch a lively De&s;cription of his Stature, Complexion, Ha|bit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that upon his Arrival he an&s;wers the Character given of him in all re&s;pects. If the Per&s;on &s;o appearing be one of the <HI>Seer</HI>'s Acquaintaince, he can tell by his Countenance whether he comes in good or bad Humour. The Author has been &s;een thus, by <HI>Seers</HI> of both Sexes, at &s;ome Hundreds of Miles Di|&s;tance: Some that &s;aw him in this manner, had never &s;een him per&s;onally, and it hap|pen'd according to their Vi&s;ions, without any previous De&s;ign of his to go to tho&s;e Places, his coming there being purely accidental; and in the Nineteenth Page of his Book, he tells us, that Mr. <HI>Daniel Morri&s;on</HI> a Mini&s;ter, told him, that upon his landing in the I&s;land <HI>Ro|na,</HI> the Natives receiv'd him very affectio|nately, and addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him with this Salutation: God &s;ave you Pilgrim! You are heartily welcome here, for we have had repeated Apparitions of your Per&s;on among&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="205">
us; <HI>viz.</HI> after the manner of the <HI>Second Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. It's ordinary with them to &s;ee Hou&s;es, Gardens, and Trees, in Places void of all Three, and this in proce&s;s of Time u&s;es to be accompli&s;h'd; of which he gives an In&s;tance in the <HI>I&s;land of Skye.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. To &s;ee a Spark of Fire fall upon one's Arm, or Brea&s;t, is a Fore-runner of a dead Child to be &s;een in the Arms of tho&s;e Per|&s;ons, of which there are &s;everal fre&s;h In|&s;tances.</P>
<P>To &s;ee a Seat empty at the time of one's &s;itting in it, is a Pre&s;age of that Per&s;on's Death quickly after.</P>
<P>When a Novice, or one, that has lately obtain'd the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> &s;ees a Vi&s;ion in the Night-time without Doors, and comes near a Fire he pre&s;ently falls into a Swoon.</P>
<P>Some find them&s;elves, as it were in a Croud of People, having a Corp&s;e which they carry along with them; and after &s;uch Vi&s;ions the <HI>Seers</HI> come in &s;weating, and de&s;cribe the Peo|ple that appear'd; if there are any of their Acquaintance among them, they give an Account of their Names, and al&s;o of the Bearers. But they know nothing concerning the Corp&s;e.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e, that have the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> do not always &s;ee the&s;e Vi&s;ions at once, though they are together at the Time; but if one, who has this Faculty, de&s;ignedly touch his
<PB N="180" REF="206">
<HI>fellow Seer,</HI> at the In&s;tant of a Vi&s;ion's appear|ing, then the <HI>Second</HI> &s;ees it as well as the <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. There is the way of fore-telling Death by a <HI>Cry,</HI> that they call <HI>Taisk,</HI> which &s;ome call a <HI>Wrath</HI> in the <HI>Low-land.</HI> They hear a <HI>loud Cry</HI> without Doors, exactly re&s;embling the Voice of &s;ome particular Per&s;on, who&s;e Death is foretold by it, of which he gives a late In&s;tance, which happen'd in the Village <HI>Rigg</HI> in <HI>Skye I&s;le.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Things are al&s;o fore-told by <HI>&s;melling</HI> &s;ometimes, as follows. Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h is fre|quently &s;melt in the Fire, when at the &s;ame Time neither of the Two are in the Hou&s;e, or, in any probability like to be had in it, for &s;ome Weeks or Months. This Smell &s;e|veral Per&s;ons have, who are endued with the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> and it's always accompli&s;h'd &s;oon after.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Children, Hor&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Cows,</HI> have the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> as well as Men and Women ad|vanc'd in Years.</P>
<P>That <HI>Children</HI> &s;ee it, it is plain, from their <HI>crying</HI> aloud at the very In&s;tant, that a Corp&s;e or any other Vi&s;ion appears to an ordinary <HI>Seer:</HI> Of which he gives an In&s;tance in a Child, when him&s;elf was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ee it's very plain, from their violent and &s;udden &s;tarting, when the Rider, or <HI>Seer</HI> in Company with them, &s;ees a Vi&s;ion of any kind by Night or Day. It's
<PB N="181" REF="207">
ob&s;ervable of a Hor&s;e, that he will not go forward that way, till he be led about at &s;ome di&s;tance from the common Road, and then he is in a Sweat: He gives an In&s;tance of this in a Hor&s;e, in the I&s;le of <HI>Skye.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Cows</HI> have the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> appears from this; that if a Woman milking a <HI>Cow</HI> happens to &s;ee a Vi&s;ion by the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> the <HI>Cow</HI> runs away in a great fright at the &s;ame time, and will not be pacify'd for &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>In Reference to this <HI>Paracel&s;us, Tom.</HI> 9. <HI>l. de arte pre&s;ag&acirc;,</HI> writes thus, <Q REND="inline">'Hor&s;es al&s;o have their Auguries, who perceive, by their <HI>Sight</HI> and <HI>Smell,</HI> wandering <HI>Spirits, Witches</HI> and <HI>Spectres,</HI> and the like Things; and Dogs both &s;ee and hear the &s;ame.'</Q></P>
<P>Here in the next place the Author an&s;wers Objections that have lately been made again&s;t the <HI>Reality</HI> of the <HI>Second Sight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It's objected, that the&s;e <HI>Seers</HI> are <HI>vi|&s;ionary</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI> People, who <HI>fancy</HI> they <HI>&s;ee</HI> Things, that do <HI>not</HI> appear to <HI>them</HI> or <HI>any Body el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He an&s;wers, The <HI>People</HI> of the&s;e <HI>I&s;les,</HI> and <HI>particularly</HI> the <HI>Seers,</HI> are very Temperate, and their Diet is &s;imple and moderate in Quantity and Quality; &s;o that their Brains are not, in all probability, di&s;ordered by un|dige&s;ted Fumes of Meat or Drink. Both Sexes are free from Hy&s;terick Fits, Convul|&s;ions, and &s;everal other Di&s;tempers of that
<PB N="180" REF="208">
Sort. There are no Madmen among them, nor any In&s;tance of Self-murther. It's ob|&s;erved among them, that a Man <HI>drunk</HI> never has a Vi&s;ion of the <HI>Second Sight;</HI> and he that is a <HI>Vi&s;ionary</HI> would di&s;cover him&s;elf in other things as well as in that; nor are &s;uch, as have the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> judg'd to be <HI>Vi&s;ionaries</HI> by any of their Friends or Acquaintaince.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It's objected, that there are none among the Learned able to oblige the World with a &s;atisfactory Account of the&s;e Vi&s;ions; therefore they are not to be believed.</P>
<P>He an&s;wers, If every Thing, of which the <HI>Learned</HI> are <HI>not able</HI> to give a &s;atisfactory Ac|count, &s;hall be <HI>condemn'd</HI> as <HI>Fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>Impo&s;|&s;ible,</HI> we &s;hall find <HI>many</HI> other Things, <HI>gene|rally believ'd,</HI> which mu&s;t be <HI>rejected</HI> as <HI>&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It's objected, that the <HI>Seers</HI> are Im|po&s;tors, and the People, who believe them, are credulous, and ea&s;y to be impos'd upon.</P>
<P>He an&s;wers, The <HI>Seers</HI> are, generally illi|terate, and well-meaning People, and altoge|ther void of De&s;ign; nor could he ever learn that any of them made the lea&s;t gain of it; neither is it reputable among them to have that Faculty: Be&s;ide the People of the I&s;les are not &s;o credulous as to believe an Impo&s;|&s;ibility, before the thing foretold be accom|pli&s;h'd; but when it actually comes to pa&s;s, afterwards it is not in their Power to deny it, without offering Violence to their Sen&s;es and Rea&s;on: Be&s;ide, if the <HI>Seers</HI> were <HI>Deceivers,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="209">
can it be rea&s;onable to imagin, that all the <HI>I&s;landers,</HI> who have not the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> &s;hould combine together, and offer Violence to their Under&s;tandings and Sen&s;es, to force them&s;elves to believe a Lye from Age to Age? There are &s;everal Per&s;ons among them, who&s;e Birth and Education rai&s;e them above the Su&s;picion of concurring with an Impo&s;ture, merely to gratify an illiterate and contemp|tible &s;ort of Per&s;ons. Nor can a rea&s;onable Man believe, that <HI>Children, Hor&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Cows,</HI> could be engaged in a Combination to per|&s;wade the World of the <HI>Reality</HI> of a <HI>Second Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Every Vi&s;ion that is &s;een, comes exactly to pa&s;s, according to the rules of Ob&s;ervation, though Novices and heedle&s;s Per&s;ons do not always judge by tho&s;e Rules; concerning which he gives In&s;tances.</P>
<P>There are Vi&s;ions &s;een by &s;everal Per&s;ons, in who&s;e Days they are not accompli&s;h'd; and this is one of the Rea&s;ons, why &s;ome Things have been &s;een, that are &s;aid never to have come to pa&s;s; and there are al&s;o &s;everal Vi&s;ions &s;een, which are not under&s;tood till they are accompli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Sight</HI> is not a late Di&s;covery, &s;een by one or two in a Corner, or a remote <HI>I&s;le;</HI> but it's &s;een by many Per&s;ons of both Sexes, in &s;everal I&s;les, &s;eparated about Forty or Fifty Leagues from one another: The In|habitants of many of the&s;e I&s;les never had
<PB N="184" REF="210">
the lea&s;t Conver&s;e by Word or Writing: And this Faculty of &s;eeing Vi&s;ions having con|tinued, as we are inform'd by Tradition, ever &s;ince the Plantation of the&s;e <HI>I&s;les,</HI> without being di&s;proved by the nice&s;t Sceptick after the &s;tricte&s;t Inquiry, &s;eems to be a clear Proof of its Reality.</P>
<P>It's ob&s;ervable, that it was much more common Twenty or Thirty Years ago, than at pre&s;ent; for One in Ten does not &s;ee it now, that &s;aw it then.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Sight</HI> is not confin'd to the <HI>We|&s;tern I&s;les</HI> alone, the Author having an Ac|count that it's in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Holland,</HI> but particularly in <HI>Bommel,</HI> where a Woman has it, for which &s;he is courted by &s;ome, and dreaded by others. She &s;ees a Smoak about one's Face, which is the fore-runner of the death of a Per&s;on &s;o &s;een, and &s;he actually foretold the deaths of &s;everal that lived there. She was living in that Town a few Winters ago.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Sight</HI> is likewi&s;e in <HI>the I&s;le of Man,</HI> as appears by this In&s;tance. Captain <HI>Leathes</HI> the chief Commander of <HI>Bellfa&s;t</HI> in his Voyage 1690, lo&s;t Thirteen Men by a vio|lent Storm, and upon his landing in the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> an ancient Man, Clerk to a Pari&s;h there, told him immediately that he had lo&s;t Thirteen Men there; the Captain enquired how he came to the Knowledge of that; he an&s;wer'd that it was by <HI>Thirteen Lights,</HI> which
<PB N="185" REF="211">
he had &s;een come into the Church-yard; as Mr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> tells us in his late De&s;cription of the <HI>I&s;le of Man.</HI> Note, that this is like the Sight of the <HI>Corp&s;e-candles</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> which is al&s;o well atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>Here the Author adds <HI>many</HI> other In&s;tances concerning the <HI>Second Sight</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;et down only a <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>A Man in <HI>Knockow,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, the northermo&s;t Part of <HI>Skye,</HI> being in perfect Health, and &s;itting with his fellow Servants at Night, was on a &s;udden taken ill, drop'd from his Seat backward, and then fell a vomiting; at which the Family was much concern'd, he having never been &s;ubject to the like before; but he came to him&s;elf &s;oon after, and had no &s;ort of Pain about him. One of the Family, who was accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> told them that the Man's Illne&s;s proceeded from a very &s;trange Cau&s;e, which was thus. An ill-natur'd Woman (whom he named) who lives in the next ad|jacent Village of <HI>Bornskittag,</HI> came before him in a very angry and furious Manner, her Countenance full of Pa&s;&s;ion, and her Mouth full of Reproaches, and threaten'd him with her Head and Hands, till he fell over, as you have &s;een him. This Woman had a Fancy for the Man, but was like to be di&s;appointed as to her marrying of him. This In&s;tance was told the Author, by the Ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="186" REF="212">
Family, and others, who were pre&s;ent when it happen'd.</P>
<P>Sir. <HI>Norman Macklead,</HI> and &s;ome others, playing at <HI>Tables,</HI> at a Game called in <HI>Iri&s;h, Falmermore,</HI> wherein there are Three of a Side, and each of them throw the Dice by turns, there happened to be one difficult Point in the di&s;po&s;ing of one of the <HI>Table-men:</HI> This obliged the Game&s;ter to deliberate, before he was to change his <HI>Man,</HI> &s;ince, upon the di&s;|po&s;ing of it, the winning or lo&s;ing of the Game depended; at length the Butler, who &s;tood behind, advi&s;ed the Player, where to place the <HI>Man,</HI> with which he comply'd and won the Game. This being thought extraordi|nary, and Sir <HI>Norman</HI> hearing one whi&s;per him in the Ear, ask'd who advis'd him &s;o skilfully? He an&s;wer'd it was the Butler, but this &s;eem'd more &s;trange, for it was generally thought he could not play at Tables. Upon this Sir <HI>Norman</HI> ask'd him how long it was &s;ince he had learn'd to play? And the Fellow own'd that he had never play'd in his Life, but that he &s;aw the Spirit <HI>Brownie</HI> (a Spirit u&s;ually &s;een in that Country) reaching his Arm over the player's Head, and touching the Part with his Finger, where the Table-man was to be placed. This was told the Author by Sir <HI>Norman,</HI> and others, who happen'd to be pre&s;ent at the Time.</P>
<P><HI>Daniel Bow</HI> alias <HI>Black,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Bornskittag,</HI> who is one of the preci&s;e&s;t <HI>Seers</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="213">
in the I&s;les, foretold the death of a young Woman in <HI>Minginis,</HI> within le&s;s than Twenty Four Hours before the Time, and accordingly &s;he died &s;uddenly in the Fields; though at the Time of the Prediction &s;he was in perfect health; but the Shrou'd appearing clo&s;e about her Head, was the Ground of his Confidence, that her Death was at Hand.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Per&s;on foretold the Death of a Child in his Ma&s;ter's Arms, by &s;eeing a Spark of Fire fall on his left Arm, and this was like|wi&s;e accompli&s;h'd &s;oon after the Prediction.</P>
<P>Some of the Inhabitants of <HI>Harries,</HI> &s;ailing round the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Skye</HI> with a De&s;ign to go to the oppo&s;ite Main-land, were &s;trangely &s;ur|prized with an Apparition of Two Men hanging down by the Ropes that &s;ecured the Ma&s;t, but could not conjecture what it meant; they pur&s;ued their Voyage, but the Wind turning contrary, they were forced into <HI>Broad|ford,</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Skye,</HI> where they found Sir <HI>Donald Mackdonald</HI> keeping a Sherriffs Court, and Two Criminals receiving Sentence of Death there. The Ropes and Ma&s;t of that very Boat were made u&s;e of to hang tho&s;e Criminals. This was told the Author by &s;everal, who had this In&s;tance related to them by the Boat's Crew.</P>

after me to her Hou&s;e. Now Mr. <HI>Marten</HI>'s Twelfth Ob&s;ervation about the <HI>Second Sight</HI> in this Chapter clears it plainly up that this Knowledge in the Boy proceeded from the <HI>Gift of Second Sight.</HI> Not to give the Rea|der too often the Trouble of looking back in order to judge of the Truth of what I &s;ay; I will here repeat that Ob&s;ervation; which is as follows. Things are al&s;o foretold by <HI>Smelling</HI> &s;ometimes: For Example <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> is frequently <HI>&s;melt</HI> in the Fire, when at the <HI>&s;ame time neither</HI> of the <HI>Two</HI> are in the Hou&s;e, or, in any <HI>probability,</HI> like to be had in it, for &s;ome <HI>Weeks</HI> or <HI>Months.</HI> This <HI>Smell</HI> &s;everal Per&s;ons have, who are endued with the <HI>Se|cond Sight,</HI> and its always accompli&s;h'd &s;oon after.</P>
<P>But I will here omit any further Remarks by way of accounting how he compa&s;s'd his Predictions, when a Boy, either by the In|tervention of his <HI>Genius,</HI> or the Gift of a <HI>Se|cond Sight;</HI> and examin how nearly tho&s;e Things, which I have related to have been done by him in his more advanc'd Years, when he took up the Profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Predictor</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> corre&s;pond with the Accounts giv|en us in this Chapter about a <HI>Second Sight,</HI> and how near a Re&s;emblance the Things done by him bear to tho&s;e Things that are &s;o well at|te&s;ted to have been perform'd by others, thro' the efficacious Power of this wonderful Fa|culty.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="227">
Fir&s;t then, if we have a mind to make a tolerable gue&s;s, which way Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> came acquainted that the Death of the beautiful young Lady, Mrs. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lw<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d</HI> was &s;o near at Hand, and that, tho' &s;he was &s;o univer&s;ally admired, &s;he would die unmarried; the Ac|counts given of other <HI>Second &s;ighted</HI> Per&s;ons in the like Ca&s;es, will put us in the mo&s;t pro|bable way of gue&s;&s;ing right. This is ex|plain'd by the Seventh Ob&s;ervation in this Chapter, where it is &s;aid from Mr. <HI>Marten,</HI> that when a Shroud is perceiv'd about one, it's a &s;ure Progno&s;tick of Death; the Time is judg'd according to the Height of it, about the Per&s;on; for if it be not &s;een above the Middle, Death is not to be expected for the &s;pace of a Year or longer, but as it comes nearer to the Head it is expected &s;ooner; if to the very Head, it is concluded to be at Hand within a few Days, if not Hours. Of this we have an Example of which Mr. <HI>Mar|ten</HI> was an Eye-witne&s;s, concerning the Death of his own Acquaintance; but he did not in the lea&s;t regard it, till the Death of the Per|&s;on, about the Time foretold, confirm'd to him the Certainty of the Prediction.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s telling <HI>Chri|&s;tallina</HI> the <HI>Belle</HI> and chief <HI>Toa&s;t</HI> of the Court, and <HI>Urbana</HI> the reigning Beauty of the City, that they &s;hould &s;hortly be married, and who were to be their Husbands; it is a Thing he has done almo&s;t every Day in his Life to one Woman or other, that comes to con&s;ult him about the Man &s;he is to be married to; the manner, he probably takes in doing this, may be likewi&s;e explain'd by the foregoing Story in this Chapter, about the Servants, who &s;aid they &s;aw Three Men &s;tanding by the left Hand of their Ma&s;ter's Daughter; and that <HI>he,</HI> that was <HI>neare&s;t</HI> would marry her <HI>fir&s;t</HI> whom they plainly and exactly de&s;cribed, tho' they had never &s;een him but in their Vi&s;ion, as appeared afterwards.

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to the Predictions deliver'd by Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> to the Merchant, which are &s;et down at length in the foregoing Chapter, I know no better way at gue&s;&s;ing the <HI>manner how</HI> the <HI>Second Sight</HI> operated in him at that Time, than by comparing them to the&s;e Two In&s;tances, which I briefly repeat, becau&s;e they are &s;et down at length before, in this Chapter. And fir&s;t it may be ask'd how did the <HI>Second Sight</HI> operate in Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> when it gave him to know, that the Merchant's Ships, which repeated Intelligences had in appearance confirm'd to be lo&s;t, were at that time &s;afe, and would return &s;ecurely home into the Harbour de&s;igned? The be&s;t way of accounting for it, that I know, is by the Story that Sir <HI>Norman Mack-Lead</HI> is above affirm'd to have told with his own Mouth concerning a Servant of his, who rightly foretold his re|turning Home and landing on the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Ber|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">era</HI> one Night, where his Re&s;idence is, when there was very little or no likelyhood of it, becau&s;e of the Darkne&s;s of the Night, and the Danger of coming through the Rocks that lie round the I&s;le. When Sir <HI>Norman</HI> exa|min'd him about it; he an&s;wer'd that he knew it by a Vi&s;ion of the Spirit <HI>Brownic:</HI> and hence it may be the mo&s;t probably conjectured that Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Knowledge of the Merchant's Ships being &s;afe, came from a Vi&s;ion of his
<PB N="204" REF="230">
particular <HI>Genius</HI> or <HI>familiar Spirit</HI> which we &s;poke of before. What I have already in|&s;tanced in, is (I think) &s;ufficient with regard to the wonderful Things which Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> has perform'd either by the Intervention of a <HI>Genius</HI> or the Power of a <HI>Second Sight.</HI> But as he has frequently done a great many amazing Performances, which &s;eem to be of &s;uch a Nature, that they can't be well and clearly explain'd to have been done either by the Intervention of his <HI>familiar Spirit</HI> and <HI>Genius,</HI> or by the Power of the <HI>Second &s;ighted Faculty,</HI> we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the Third Means, by which only &s;uch Predictions and Practices can be compa&s;s'd, before we expound the&s;e new My&s;teries, which appear like incre|dible Riddles, and <HI>Aenigma's</HI> at the fir&s;t; and this <HI>Third Means</HI> which we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to, for expounding the&s;e &s;trange Acts of his, is a due con&s;ideration of the Force and Power of Natural Magick, which together with a Nar|rative of the Acts, which he &s;eems <HI>magically</HI> to bring about, will be the Subject of the following Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>BUT before we proceed to our Di&s;qui|&s;itions concerning the Power and Effica|cy of natural Magick, and examin what my|&s;terious Operations may be brought about and compa&s;s'd by magical Practices, and before we take a further Survey of what Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> has perform'd in this kind, that relates to his Profe&s;&s;ion and the publick Part of his Life, which concerns other People as well as him&s;elf; I &s;hall here relate &s;ome &s;ingular Ad|ventures, that he pa&s;s'd thoro' in his private Life, and which regard only his own Per&s;on. In order to this, I mu&s;t return back to the Year 1702, about which time &s;ome unac|countable Turns of Fortune attended him in his own private Capacity, which mu&s;t be very &s;urprizing and entertaining to my Rea|ders, when they find a Man, who&s;e Fore-&s;ight was always &s;o great a Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to others, who con&s;ulted him in their own fu|ture Affairs, helple&s;s (as it has been an Ob|&s;ervation concerning all &s;uch Men in the ac|count of the <HI>Second Sight</HI>) and blind in his own future Affairs, to&s;s'd up and down by inevitable and &s;pightful Accidents of Fortune, and made the May-game of Chance and Ha|zard, as if that way-ward and incon&s;tant Godde&s;s was re&s;olv'd to puni&s;h him, when
<PB N="206" REF="232">
&s;he catch'd him on the blind Side, for having &s;uch a quick in&s;ight and penetrating Faculty in other Peoples Matters, and &s;crutinizing too narrowly into her My&s;teries, and &s;o &s;ome|times preventing tho&s;e fatal Intentions of hers, into which &s;he would fain lead many Mor|tals hood-wink'd, and before they knew where they were. In this Light, the&s;e mighty and famous <HI>Seers</HI> &s;eem to be born for the Benefit and Felicity of others, but at the &s;ame time to be born to Unhappine&s;s them&s;elves. And cer|tainly, in as much as we con&s;ider them as u&s;eful and beneficial often, but always &s;atisfactory, to Per&s;ons, who are curious in their Inquiries about their Fortunes; it will be natural to tho&s;e of us, who have the lea&s;t Share of Ge|nero&s;ity in our Minds, to yield our Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion to them, when they are remar|kably unfortunate them&s;elves; e&s;pecially when that Calamity &s;eems more particularly to light upon them for their Ability, and Endeavour to con&s;ult the good Fortune of other Folks.</P>
<P>About the abovementioned Year 1702, <HI>Dun|can Campbel</HI> grew a little tired of his Profe&s;&s;ion. Such a multitude of Followers troubled him, &s;everal of whom were wild Youths and came to banter him, and many more too inqui&s;itive Females, to teaze him with endle&s;s Imper|tinences, and who, the more he told them, had &s;till the more to ask, and who&s;e Curio|&s;ity was never to be &s;atisfied: And be&s;ides this he was &s;o much envy'd, and had &s;o many
<PB N="207" REF="233">
malicious Artifices daily practi&s;ed again&s;t him, that he re&s;olv'd to leave off his Profe&s;&s;ion. He had (I know) follow'd it pretty clo&s;ely from the time I fir&s;t &s;aw him in <HI>London,</HI> which was I think in the beginning of the Year 1698, till the Year 1702, with very good Succe&s;s; and in tho&s;e few Years he had got together a pretty round Summ of Mony. Our young <HI>Seer</HI> was now at Man's E&s;tate, and had learn'd the Notion that he was to be his own Gover|nour, &s;o far as to be his own Coun&s;ellor too in what Road of Life he was to take, and this Con&s;ideration (no doubt) work'd with a <HI>deeper</HI> Impre&s;&s;ion on <HI>his</HI> Mind, than it u&s;u|ally does on <HI>others</HI> that are in the &s;ame <HI>blo&s;|&s;oming Pride</HI> of Manhood, becau&s;e it might appear more natural for him to believe, that he had a &s;ufficient Ability to be his own pro|per Advi&s;er, who had given &s;o many others, and &s;ome more aged than him&s;elf, Coun&s;el, with very good Succe&s;s. Now every expe|rienc'd Per&s;on knows, that when Manhood is yet green, it is &s;till in the &s;ame dangerous Con|dition as a young Plant, which is liable to be warp'd by a Thou&s;and cro&s;s fortuitous Acci|dents, if good Mea&s;ures be not taken to &s;up|port it again&s;t all the contingent Shocks it may meet with from the Weather or other|wi&s;e. Now it was his Misfortune to be made aver&s;e to Bu&s;ine&s;s, which he lov'd before, by having too much of it, and to be &s;o &s;oured by meeting with numerous Perplexities and
<PB N="208" REF="234">
malicious Rubs laid in his way by invidious People, (who are the u&s;ele&s;s and injurious <HI>Bu&s;y|bodies,</HI> that always repine at the good of o|thers, and rejoice to do harm to the Diligent and A&s;&s;iduous, though they reap no Profit by it them&s;elves;) that he was di&s;gu&s;ted and de|terr'd entirely from the Pro&s;ecution of a Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, by which he got not only a compe|tent but a copious and plentiful Sub&s;i&s;tence. Nay indeed this was another Mi&s;chief ari&s;ing to him from his having &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had got Money enough to leave it off, when the Perplexities of it had made him willing to do &s;o, and to live very comfortably and hand&s;omely, like a Gentleman without it, for a time; and we know the younge&s;t Men are not wont to look the farthe&s;t before them, in matters that concern their own Wel|fare. Now ina&s;much as he had thus taken a Di&s;gu&s;t to Bu&s;ine&s;s and Application, and was &s;urfeited (as I may &s;ay) with the Perplexities of it, it mu&s;t be as natural for him, we know, to &s;earch for Repo&s;e in the contrary extream, <HI>viz.</HI> Recreation and Idlene&s;s, as it is for a Man to &s;eek Re&s;t after Toil, to &s;leep after a Day's Labour, or to &s;it down after a long and tire&s;ome Walk. But there are two very di|&s;tinct &s;orts of Idlene&s;s, and two very different kinds of Recreation; there is a &s;hameful Idle|ne&s;s which is no better than down-right Sloth; and there is a &s;plendid kind of Indo|lence, where a Man having taken an Aver&s;ion
<PB N="209" REF="235">
to the Weari&s;omene&s;s of a Bu&s;ine&s;s which pro|perly belongs to him, neglects not however to employ his Thoughts, when they are va|cant from what they ought more chiefly to be about, in other Matters not entirely un|profitable in Life, the Exerci&s;e of which he finds he can follow with more abundant Ea&s;e and Satisfaction. There are &s;ome Sorts of Recreations too, that are mean, fordid, and ba&s;e; others, that are very innocent, though very diverting, and that will give one the very next mo&s;t valuable Qualifications of a Gentleman, after tho&s;e, which are obtained by a more &s;erious Application of the Mind. The Idea which I have already given my Readers of our <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> will ea&s;ily make them judge, before I tell them, which way, in the&s;e two Ways, his <HI>Genius</HI> would naturally lead him; and that, when he grew an idle Man, he would rather indulge him|&s;elf with applying his Mind to the &s;hining Trifles of Life, than be wholly &s;lothful and unactive; and that when he diverted him|&s;elf he would not do it after a fordid ba&s;e manner, as having a better ta&s;te and a reli&s;h for good Company; but that his Recreations would &s;till be the Recreations of a Gentle|man. And ju&s;t, accordingly, as my Readers would naturally judge before-hand in his Ca&s;e, &s;o it really happened. The Moment he &s;hook of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and di&s;mi&s;s'd the Thoughts of it, his <HI>Genius</HI> led him to a very gallant
<PB N="210" REF="236">
Way of Life; in his Lodgings, in his Enter|tainments in paying and receiving Vi&s;its, in Coffee-hou&s;es, in Taverns, in fencing Schools, in Balls and other publick A&s;&s;emblies, in all ways in fine both at home and abroad, <HI>Dun|can Campbell</HI> was a well comported and civil fine Gentleman; he was a Man of Plea&s;ure, and nothing of the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s appeared about him. But a Gentleman's Life without a Gentleman's E&s;tate, however &s;hining and plea&s;ant it may be for a time, will certainly end in Sorrow if not in Infamy; and com|paring Life (as Morali&s;ts do) to a Day, one may &s;afely pronounce this Truth to all the &s;plendid Idlers, I have mention'd, that if they have &s;un&s;hiny Weather till Noon, yet the After-noon of their Life will be very &s;tormy, rainy and uncomfortable, and per|haps ju&s;t at the end of their Journey, to carry on the <HI>Metaphor</HI> throughout, clo&s;e in the dark|e&s;t kind of Night. Of this, as I was a Man of Years and more experienc'd in the World than he, I took upon me to forewarn Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> as &s;oon as I perceiv'd the fir&s;t dange|rous Fit of this elegant Idlene&s;s had &s;eiz'd him. But when will young Men, by &s;o much the more head-&s;trong as they have le&s;s of the Beard, be guided and brought to learn, and when &s;hall we &s;ee that happy Age, in which the grey Heads of old Men &s;hall be clapp'd upon the Shoulders of Youth? I told him, that in this one thing he ought to con&s;ult me,
<PB N="211" REF="237">
and acknowledge me to be a true Prophet, if I told him the end of the &s;eeming merry Steps in Life, he was now taking, would in|fallibly bring him to a Labyrinth of Difficul|ties, out of which if he extricated him&s;elf at all, he would at lea&s;t find it a laborious piece of Work. His Ta&s;te had been already vitia|ted with the Sweets which lay at the top of the bitter Draught of Fortune, and my hone&s;t rugged Coun&s;el came too late to prevail, when his Fancy had decoy'd and debauch'd his Judgement, and carry'd it over into another Intere&s;t. I remember I writ down to him the moral Story, where vicious Plea&s;ure and Virtue are pictured by the Philo&s;opher to ap|pear before <HI>Hercules,</HI> to court him into two &s;everal Paths. I told him more particu|larly &s;ince he had not an E&s;tate to go th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> with the gentlemanly Life (as he call'd it) that, if he follow'd the alluring Plea&s;ures, which endeavour'd to tempt <HI>Hercules,</HI> he would in|volve him&s;elf at la&s;t in a whole heap of Mi|&s;eries, out of which it would be more than an <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour for him to di&s;entangle him&s;elf again. If he had been a Man that could have ever heard with either, I would have told the Reader in a very familiar Idi|om, that he turn'd the deaf Ear to me; for he did not mind one Syllable nor Tittle of the Pre&s;criptions I &s;et down for him, no more than if he had never read them; but, varying the Phra&s;e a little, I may &s;ay at lea&s;t, when
<PB N="212" REF="238">
he &s;hould have look'd upon my Coun&s;el with all the Eyes he had, he turn'd the blind Side upon it. I was re&s;olv'd to make u&s;e of the Revenge natural to a Man of Years, and there|fore apply'd that reproachful Proverb to him, which we Ancients delight much in making u&s;e of to Youths, that follow their own fal&s;e and hot Imaginations, and will not heed the cooler Dictates of Age, Experience, and Wi&s;dom. Accordingly I wrote down to him the&s;e Words and left him in a &s;eeming Pa&s;|&s;ion. I am very well a&s;&s;ured, <HI>young Man,</HI> you <HI>think me,</HI> that am <HI>Old</HI> to be a <HI>Fool;</HI> but <HI>I,</HI> that am <HI>Old,</HI> ab&s;olutely <HI>know you</HI> who are a <HI>young Fellow,</HI> to <HI>be a down-right Fool,</HI> and &s;o I leave you to follow your own ways, till &s;ad and woful Experience teaches you to know it your own&s;elf, and makes you come to me to own it of your own accord. As I was go|ing away after this tart Admonition and &s;e|vere Reprimand, I had a Mind to ob&s;erve his Countenance, and I &s;aw him &s;mile, which I rightly con&s;trued to be done in contempt of the advice of Age, and in the Gaiety and Ful|ne&s;s of Conceit, which Youth entertains of its own fond Opinions and hair-brain'd ra&s;h Re&s;olves. He was got into the Company of a very pretty &s;et of Gentlemen, who&s;e For|tunes were far &s;uperior to his; but he follow'd the &s;ame genteel Exerci&s;es, as Fencing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and made one at all their publick Entertain|ments; and &s;o being at an equal Expence,
<PB N="213" REF="239">
with tho&s;e, who could well afford to &s;pend, what they did, out of their E&s;tates; he went on very plea&s;antly for a time, &s;till &s;pending and never getting, without ever con&s;idering, that it mu&s;t, by inevitable con&s;equence, fall to his Lot at la&s;t to be entirely reduced to a State of Indigence and Want. And what com|monly heightens the Misfortune of &s;uch Men (and &s;o of all Gentlemens younger Brothers,) who live upon the ready Money that is given them for their Portions, is, that the Pro&s;pe|rity they live in for a time gains them Credit enough, ju&s;t to bring them in Debt, and ren|der them more Mi&s;erable, than tho&s;e very Wratches, who never had either any Money or Credit at all. They run them&s;elves into Debt out of Shame, and to put off the evil Day of appearing ruin'd Men as long as they can, and then when their Tempers are &s;ou|er'd by Adver&s;ity, they grow tir'd of their own Lives, and then in a Quarrel they or &s;ome other Gentleman, may be, is run thorough, or el&s;e being hunted by Bayliffs, they Exer|ci&s;e their Swords upon tho&s;e Pur&s;uers. Thus where Gentlemen will not con&s;ider their Cir|cum&s;tances, their very Pro&s;perity is a Cau&s;e of, and aggravates their Mi&s;ery, their very <HI>Pride</HI> (which was a decent Pride at fir&s;t) in keeping up and maintaining their <HI>Credit,</HI> &s;ub|jects them too often to the lowe&s;t and the meane&s;t Acts, and their Courage, which was of a laudable Kind, turns into a bruti&s;h and
<PB N="214" REF="240">
&s;avage Rage; and all the fine, e&s;teem'd flou|ri&s;hing and happy, Gentleman ends, and is lo&s;t in the contemn'd poor and mi&s;erable De&s;perado, who&s;e Portion at la&s;t is Confine|ment and a Goal, and &s;ometimes even wor&s;e, and what I &s;hall not &s;o much as name here. Into many of the&s;e Calamities Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had brought him&s;elf, before it was long, by his heedle&s;ne&s;s, and running, according to the wild Dictates of Youth, counter to all &s;ound and whole&s;ome Advice. He had (it &s;eems) run him&s;elf into Debt, and one Day, as he was at a Coffee-hou&s;e the Sign of the Three <HI>Crowns</HI> in great <HI>Queen-&s;treet,</HI> in ru&s;h'd Four Bayliffs upon him, who being directed by the Creditor's Wife, had watch'd him into that Hou&s;e, and told him they had a Warrant a|gain&s;t him, and upon his not an&s;wering, they being unacquainted with his being deaf and dumb, offer'd to &s;eize his Sword. He &s;tart|led at their offering of Violence, and taking them for Ru&s;&s;ians (which he had often met with) repell'd the A&s;&s;aulters, and drawing his Sword, as one Man, more bold than the re&s;t, clo&s;ed in with him, he &s;horten'd his Blade, and in the Fall pinn'd the Fellow through the Shoulder, and him&s;elf through the Leg, to the Floor. After that he &s;tood at Bay with all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Four Officers, when the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous A&s;&s;ailant of them all, the Creditor's Wife, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;tep into the Fray, and very bar|borously took hold of that namele&s;s Part of

the Man, for which, as &s;he was a married Woman, Nature methinks &s;hould have taught her to have a greater Tenderne&s;s, and almo&s;t &s;queez'd and cru&s;h'd tho&s;e Vitals to death. But at la&s;t he got free from them all, and was going away as fa&s;t as he could, not knowing what Con&s;equences might en&s;ue. But the Woman who aim'd her&s;elf at committing Murder, in the mo&s;t &s;avage and inhuman Manner, ran out after him, crying out Mur|der, Murder, as loud as &s;he could, and alarm|ed the whole Street. The Bayliff's following the Woman, and being bloody from Head to Foot, by means of the Wound he receiv'd, gave Credit to the Outcry. The late Earl <HI>Ri|vers</HI>'s Footmen happening to be at the Door ran immediately to &s;top the &s;uppos'd Mur|derer, and they indeed did take him at la&s;t, but perceiv'd their Mi&s;take, and di&s;covered that in&s;tead of being A&s;&s;i&s;tants in taking a Man, whom they thought to be a Murderer endeavouring to make his E&s;cape from the Hands of Ju&s;tice, they had only been trick'd in by that fal&s;e Cry to be Adjutants to a Bay|liff in retaking a Gentleman who, by &s;o gallant a Defence, had re&s;cu'd him&s;elf from the Dan|gers of a Pri&s;on; and when they had di&s;co|ver'd this their Mi&s;take they were mighty &s;orry for what they had done. The mo&s;t a|ctive and bu&s;y among the Earl's Footmen was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, and the Earl happening to be in a Room next the Street, and hearing the
<PB N="216" REF="242">
Outcry of Murder, &s;tep'd to the Window, and &s;eeing his own Servants in the mid&s;t of the Bu&s;tle, examin'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man how the Matter was, and, being told it, he chid the Man for being concern'd in &s;topping a Gen|tleman that was getting free from &s;uch trou|ble&s;ome Companions. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man excu&s;ed him&s;elf, like a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, by ma|king a very merry Blunder for a Reply. <HI>Sa|cramente,</HI> &s;aid he, to his Lord, if I had thought they were Bayliffs, I would have fought for the poor dumb <HI>Gentleman,</HI> but then why had not <HI>he told</HI> me they were Bailiffs my Lord?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> was carry'd off as their Pri&s;oner; but the Bayliff, that was wounded, was led back to the Coffee Hou&s;e where he pretended the Wound was Mortal, and that he de&s;pair'd of living an Hour. The Proverb however was of the Fellow's Side, and he recover'd &s;ooner than other People ex|pected he could. A&s;&s;oon as all Danger was over, an Action for Damages and &s;mart Mo|ney (as their Term is) was brought again&s;t Mr. <HI>Campbell;</HI> the Damages were exaggera|ted and the Demand was &s;o extravagant, that <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> was neither able, ju&s;t at that Time, nor willing, had he been able, to pay &s;o much, as he thought, in his own Wrong, and having no Bail, and being a&s;ham'd to make his ca&s;e known to his better &s;ort of Friends, who were both able and willing to help him at a dead Li&s;t, he was hurry'd away
<PB N="217" REF="243">
to Goal by the Bayliffs, who &s;hew'd &s;uch a malignant and in&s;olent Plea&s;ure, as commonly attends powerful Revenge, when they put him into the Mar&s;hal&s;ea. There he lay in Confinement Six Weeks, till at la&s;t Four or Five of his chief Friends came by mere Chance to hear of it; immediately they con|&s;ulted about his Deliverance and unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to contribute for his Enlargement, and they accordingly went cro&s;s the Water to|gether, and procured it out of Hand.</P>
<P>Two of his Benefactors were Officers, and were ju&s;t then going over to <HI>Flanders. Dun|can Campbell,</HI> to whom they communicated their De&s;ign, was re&s;olved to try his Fortune in a Military Way, out of a roving kind of Humour, rai&s;ed in him partly by his having taken a &s;ort of Aver&s;ion to his own Profe&s;&s;ion in Town, and partly, by his finding, that he could not live, without following a Profe&s;&s;ion as he had done, any longer. He over a Bot|tle frankly imparted his Mind to them at large; he &s;ignify'd to them that he hoped, &s;ince they had lately done him &s;o great a Fa|vour, in freeing him from one Captivity, they would not think him too urgent, if he pre&s;s'd for one Favour further, upon Natures &s;o ge|nerous as theirs, by whom he took as great a Plea&s;ure in being obliged, as he could re|ceive in being capable of obliging others.

<PB N="218" REF="244">
as irk&s;ome to him, as that, out of which they had lately ran&s;om'd him. This Captivity, continued he, is, being either forc'd to follow my old Profe&s;&s;ion, which I have taken an en|tire Di&s;gu&s;t to, for a Maintenance, or being forc'd to live in a narrower Way than &s;uits with my <HI>Genius,</HI> and the better Ta&s;te I have of higher Life. Such a State, Gentlemen, you know, is more unpalatable than Half-pay; it is like either being forc'd to go upon the <HI>for|lorn Hope,</HI> or el&s;e like a Man's being an entire|ly ca&s;hier'd and broken Officer, that had no younger Brother's Fortune, and no other Sup|port but his Commi&s;&s;ion. Thus though you have &s;et my Body at Liberty, my Soul is &s;till under an Impri&s;onment, and will be till I leave <HI>England,</HI> and can find means of vi&s;iting <HI>Flanders,</HI> which I can do no otherwi&s;e than by the advantage of having you for my Con|voy.

His Baggage was not very long a getting toge|ther, and he had it in tolerable good Order, and as for his Pa&s;s, a Brother of the Lord <HI>Forbes</HI> was &s;o kind, as to procure him one, upon the fir&s;t Application <HI>Duncan</HI> made to him.</P>
<P>Accordingly in a few Days afterwards they went on Board, and having a &s;peedy and an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age, arrived &s;oon at <HI>Rotterdam.

He walk'd out of &s;ight from his Com|pany, and they lo&s;t one another; and &s;troling about by him&s;elf at an un&s;ea&s;onable Hour, as
<PB N="220" REF="246">
they call it there after the Bell has toll'd, <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> who neither knew their Laws, nor if he had, was capable of being guided by the notice which their Laws ordain, was taken into Cu&s;tody in the Village for that Night, and carry'd away the next Day to <HI>William&s;tadt,</HI> where he was taken for a Spy, and put into a clo&s;e Impri&s;onment for Three or Four Days.</P>
<P>But &s;ome <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentlemen, who had been in Company with Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> at Mr. <HI>Cloy|&s;terman</HI>'s a Painter in <HI>Covent-garden,</HI> made their Application to the Magi&s;trate and got him relea&s;s'd: He knew his Friends the Of|ficers, that carried him over, were gone for|ward to the Camp, and that there was no Hope of finding them at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> if he &s;hould go thither, and &s;o he re&s;olv'd &s;ince he had had &s;o many Days Puni&s;hment in <HI>Wil|liam&s;tadt,</HI> to have Three or Four Days Plea|&s;ure there too by way of Amends, before he would &s;et out on his Journey after his Friends.

in &s;o orderly a Town; &s;o the Governor's Secretary, after the matter was examined in|to, judging it better for the unhappy Gentle|man's future Safety, advis'd him to return home to his own Country, and accordingly be&s;poke him a Place in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship called <HI>Yowfrow Catherine,</HI> for his Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> had taken up this Hu|mour of rambling fir&s;t, of his own accord, and the Troubles which he had run him&s;elf into by it, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, had pretty well cur'd him of that extravagant Itch; and there is little doubt to be made, but that he rejoyc'd very heartily, when he was got on Board the Ship to return to <HI>En|gland;</HI> and that, in his new Re&s;olutions, he had reconciled him&s;elf to the Pro&s;ecution of his former Profe&s;&s;ion, and intended to &s;et up for a <HI>Predictor</HI> again a&s;&s;oon as he could arrive at <HI>London.</HI> But now Fortune had not a Mind to let him go off &s;o; he had had his own Fancy for rambling, and now &s;he was re&s;olv'd to have hers, and to give him his bellyful of Caprice.

Guns: The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el was defencele&s;s in compari&s;on; and the People on Board had &s;carce time to think, and to deplore that they &s;hould be made a Prey of, before they actu|ally were <HI>&s;o,</HI> and had Rea&s;on enough given them for their Sorrow. All the Pa&s;&s;engers, to a &s;ingle Man, were &s;tripp'd, and had <HI>French</HI> Sea-mens Jackets in exchange for their Cloaths. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> had now a Ta&s;te given him of the Fate of War, as well as of the Humour of travelling, and wi&s;h'd him&s;elf again, I warrant him, among his greate&s;t Croud of Con&s;ulters, as tire&s;ome as he thought Bu&s;ine&s;s to be, in&s;tead of being in the Middle of a Crew of <HI>Sea-Savages.</HI> The Town, where the Dumb-pri&s;oner was at la&s;t confin'd, was <HI>Denain.</HI> There happened to be &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fryers there, who were told by the others, who he was, and to them he apply'd him&s;elf in writing, and receiv'd from them a great deal of civil Treatment. But a certain Man of the Order of <HI>Recollects,</HI> happening to &s;ee him there, who had known him in <HI>England,</HI> and what Profe&s;&s;ion he followed, cau&s;ed him to be called to Que&s;tion as a Man that made u&s;e of ill means to tell Fortunes. When he was que&s;tion'd by a whole Society of the&s;e religious Men, he made them &s;uch pertinent and &s;atisfactory An&s;wers in writing, that he convinced them he had done nothing for which he de&s;erv'd their Reprimand; and they unanimou&s;ly acquitted him. The Heads of
<PB N="233" REF="249">
his Defence, as I have been informed, were the&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He alledg'd that the <HI>Second Sight</HI> was in-born and in-bred in &s;ome Men; and that every Country had had Examples of it more or le&s;s; but that the Country of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which he was educated from an Infant, a|bounded the mo&s;t of any with tho&s;e &s;ort of People: And from thence he &s;aid he thought he might very naturally draw this Conclu|&s;ion, that a Faculty that was in-born and in|bred to Men, and grown almo&s;t a national Faculty among a People, who were remark|ably Hone&s;t, Upright and well-meaning Peo|ple, could not, without &s;ome Impiety, be im|puted to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it as a Sin; and when one of the Fathers rejoin'd, that it was remark'd by &s;everal Writers, of the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> that it mu&s;t be therefore <HI>Sinful,</HI> be|cau&s;e it remain'd no longer among the People when the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity were ful|ly propagated, and the Light of the Go&s;pel increa&s;ed among them; and that afterwards it affected none but Per&s;ons of vicious Lives and an ill Character. To this Objection Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> reply'd, that he knew mo&s;t (even ingenious) Writers had made that Remark concerning the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> but beg'd leave to be excu&s;ed, if he ventured to declare, that it was no better than a vulgar and common Error; and the Rea&s;ons were the&s;e, which he alledg'd in his own behalf, and to confirm his
<PB N="224" REF="250">
A&s;&s;ertion, he told them Men of undoubted Probity, Virtue and Learning, both of <HI>their own Religion,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick) and al&s;o of <HI>the Reform'd Religion,</HI> and in &s;eve|ral Nations had been affected, and continued all their Lives to be affected, with this <HI>Second &s;ighted</HI> Power, and that there could be there|fore no room to fix upon it the odious Cha|racter of being a &s;inful and vicious (not to &s;ay that &s;ome call'd it &s;till wor&s;e, a diabolical) Talent. He &s;aid he would content him&s;elf with making but two In&s;tances, becau&s;e he believ'd tho&s;e Two would be enough to give Content to them, his Judges too, in that Ca&s;e. In his fir&s;t In&s;tance he told them that they might find &s;omewhat relating to this in <HI>Nicolaus Hemingius,</HI> who in his Tracts <HI>de Su|per&s;titionibus Magicis,</HI> printed at <HI>Copenhagen, Anno</HI> 1575, informs the World; that <HI>Petrus Palladius,</HI> a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Seelandt,</HI> and Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity at <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> could, from a part of his Body affected, foretel from what part of the Heavens Tempe&s;ts would come, and was &s;eldom deceiv'd. One of the Father's immediately ask'd him if he under&s;tood <HI>La|tin?</HI>&mdash;To this <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> reply'd no. Oh! Said the Fryer then, I don't remember that Book was ever tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that you mention:&mdash;But rejoin'd <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age I mention'd to you, I have read in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book, and Word for Word, according to the be&s;t of my Memory,
<PB N="225" REF="251">
as I have written it down to you.&mdash;In what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book &s;aid the Fryer?&mdash;I don't re|member the Name of the Book, <HI>Duncan Camp|bell</HI> an&s;wer'd, but very well remember the Pa&s;&s;ages, and that it was in a Book of Au|thority, and which bore a Credit and good Re|pute in the World; and you being Scholars, may, if you plea&s;e, have recour&s;e to the learn|ed Original, and I doubt not but you'll find, what I &s;ay, to be a Truth.&mdash;For the Second In&s;tance, he told them; that, in <HI>Spain,</HI> there are tho&s;e they call <HI>Saludadores,</HI> that have this kind of Gift. There was (continued he in Writing) one of your own Religion, vene|rable Fathers, and of a religious Order, nay a Fryer too, that had this Gift: He was a noted <HI>Dominican,</HI> &s;aid he, and though I for|get his Name, you may by writing a Letter to <HI>England</HI> learn his Name. He was a devout <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> belonging to Queen <HI>Catherine Dow|ager's</HI> Chappel; and had the <HI>Second Sight</HI> to a great degree, and was famous and eminent for it. They then ask'd him what was the full Power he had to do by the <HI>Second Sight.</HI> He an&s;wer'd, that as they had intimated, that they had peru&s;ed &s;ome of the skilful Wri|ters concerning the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> he did not doubt but they had found (as well as he could tell them) that as to the Extent of Peoples Knowledge in that &s;ecret way, it reach'd both pre&s;ent, pa&s;t, and future Events. They fore|&s;ee Murders, Drownings, Weddings, Burials,
<PB N="226" REF="252">
Combats, Man&s;laughters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all which there are many In&s;tances to be given. They commonly fore&s;ee &s;ad Events a little while before they happen; for In&s;tance, if a Man's fatal End be Hanging, they'll &s;ee a Gibbet, or Rope about his Neck; if Beheading, they'll &s;ee a Man without a Head; if Drowning, they'll &s;ee Water up to his Throat; if Stab|bing, they'll &s;ee a Dagger in his Brea&s;t; if un|expected Death in his Bed, they'll &s;ee a wind|ing Sheet about his Head: They foretel not only Marriages, but of good Children, what kind of Life Men &s;hall lead, and in what Con|dition they &s;hall die, al&s;o Riches, Honours, Preferments, Peace, Plenty, and good Wea|ther: It's likewi&s;e u&s;ual with Per&s;ons, that have lo&s;t any Thing, to go to &s;ome of the&s;e Men, by whom they are directed, how, with what Per&s;ons, and in what Place, they &s;hall find their Goods. It is al&s;o to be noted, that the&s;e Gifts bear a Latitude, &s;o that &s;ome have it in a far more eminent Degree than others; and what I have here written down to you, you need not take as a Truth from me, but as it concern'd me &s;o nearly, I remember the Pa&s;|&s;age by heart, and you will find it very near Word for Word, in Dr. <HI>Beaumont</HI>'s Book of <HI>familiar Spirits.</HI> Ay &s;aid the Fryers, but you have a <HI>Genius</HI> too that attends you as we are inform'd. So, reply'd <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> have all Per&s;ons, that have the <HI>Second Sight</HI> in any eminent Degree; and to prove this I will
<PB N="227" REF="253">
bring no le&s;s a Witne&s;s than King <HI>James,</HI> who, in his <HI>Demonology,</HI> Book the Third and Chap|ter the Second, mentions al&s;o a Spirit call'd <HI>Brownie,</HI> that was wont formerly to haunt divers Hou&s;es, without doing any Evil; but doing, as it were, nece&s;&s;ary turns up and down the Hou&s;e; he appear'd like a rough Man, nay, &s;ome believ'd, that their Hou&s;e was all the <HI>Son&s;ier,</HI> as they call'd it, that is, the more lucky, or fortunate, that &s;uch Spirits re&s;orted there. With the&s;e replies the Fryers began to own they were very well &s;atisfy'd, and ac|quie&s;e'd in the Account he had given of him|&s;elf, as a very good, true, and hone&s;t Account: But they told him they had &s;till a further Ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t him, and that was that he practis'd Magick Arts, and that he us'd, as they had been inform'd, unlawful Incanta|tions. To this he made An&s;wer, that there were two Kinds of Magick, of which, he knew, they, that were Men of learning, could not be ignorant. The Art Magick, which is Wicked and Impious, continued he, is that which is profe&s;s'd, and has been profe&s;s'd at all Times in the World, by <HI>Witches, Magi|cians, Diviners, Inchanters,</HI> and &s;uch like no|torious Profligates, who by having an unna|tural Commerce with the Devil, do many &s;trange, prodigious, and preternatural Acts a|bove and beyond all humane Wi&s;dom; and all the Arguments I ever did or ever will de|duce (continued he) from that black Art, is a
<PB N="228" REF="254">
good and a &s;hining Argument: It is this, O Fathers, I draw a Rea&s;on from the&s;e prodi|gious Practices of <HI>Wizards, Magicians, In|chanters, &amp;c.</HI> and from all the Heathen Ido|latry and Super&s;tition, to prove, that there is a <HI>Deity;</HI> for from the&s;e Acts of theirs, be|ing preternatural and above humane Wi&s;dom, we may con&s;equently infer that they proceed from a &s;upernatural and immaterial Cau&s;e, &s;uch as <HI>Demons</HI> are. And this is all the Know|ledge I ever did or ever will draw from that black helli&s;h Art. But (Fathers!) there is another Kind of Art Magick call'd natural Magick, which is directly oppo&s;ite to theirs, and the Object of which Art is to do &s;piritual Good to Mankind, as the Object of theirs is to torment them, and induce them to Evil. They afflict People with Torments, and my Art relieves them from the Torments they cau&s;e. The publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e <HI>Ma|gical Arts</HI> has (as you know, Fathers, 'tis a common Di&s;tinction between <HI>black</HI> and <HI>white</HI> Magick,) been tolerated in &s;ome of the mo&s;t famous Univer&s;ities of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> though afterwards for a very good Rea&s;on in <HI>Poli|ticks,</HI> making it a publick Study to &s;uch a Degree was very wi&s;ely retrench'd by a Pro|hibition. If this therefore be a Fault in your own Opinions, hear my <HI>Accu&s;ers,</HI> but if not you will not only <HI>excu&s;e</HI> but <HI>commend</HI> me.</P>
<P>The Fryers were extreamly well plea&s;ed with his Defence: But one of them had a
<PB N="229" REF="255">
Mind to frighten him a little if he could, and ask'd him what he would &s;ay, if he could pro|duce &s;ome Witches lately &s;eiz'd, that would &s;wear he had been frequently at their unlaw|ful A&s;&s;emblies, where they were making their waxen Images, and other odd mi&s;chievous Inventions in black Magick, to torment Folks; what if I can produce &s;uch Evidence again&s;t you, wrote the Father to him by way of &s;trengthening the Que&s;tion, will you not own that we have convicted you then? And when he had wrote the Note he gave it <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> with a Look that &s;eem'd to expre&s;s his Warmth and Earne&s;tne&s;s in the Expo&s;tu|lation. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> took the Paper and read it, and far from being &s;tartled, return'd this An&s;wer, with a Smile continuing in his Face, while he wrote it. No &s;aid he, Fathers, by your leave, they will only prove me a good Magician by that Oath, and them&s;elves more plainly Witches. They will prove their Love to torment good Folks, and only &s;hew their Hatred to me an innocent Man, but wi&s;e enough to torment 'em by hindering 'em from tormenting others. The Fathers were well pleas'd with the Shrewdne&s;s of the An|&s;wer: But <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> had a mind to exert his Genius a little farther with the good Fryer, who thought likewi&s;e he had put him a very &s;hrew'd Que&s;tion; &s;o taking up ano|ther Sheet of Paper; Fathers, &s;aid he, &s;hall I entertain you with a Story of what pa&s;s'd,

The Story is &s;omewhat long, but very much to the purpo&s;e, and en|tertaining: I remember it perfectly by heart, and if you will have Patience while I am writing it, I don't doubt but that I &s;hall not only &s;atisfy you, but plea&s;e you, and oblige you, with the Relation.

among them in what they call their <HI>Dormi|tory;</HI> he had an odd Coat and a pair of Trow|zers made out of &s;ome of their brown coar&s;e Habits, by the poor unfa&s;hionable Taylor or <HI>Botcher</HI> belonging to the Convent, and at la&s;t they found means of recommending him to a Ma&s;ter of a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, that was ready to &s;et Sail, to give him a ca&s;t over the Channel to <HI>England;</HI> and to provide him with the Ne|ce&s;&s;aries of Life, till he got to the Port. This <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el was luckier than the <HI>Dutch one</HI> had been before to our dumb Gentleman, it had a quick and pro&s;perous Pa&s;&s;age, and ar|riv'd at <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and as &s;oon as he landed there, he having experienc'd the Misfortunes and Ca&s;ualties, that a Man in his Condition wanting both Speech and hearing was liable to, in Places where he was an utter Stranger to every Body, re&s;olv'd to make no Stay but move on as fa&s;t as he could towards <HI>London.</HI> When he came to <HI>Hampton Town,</HI> con&s;idering the indifferent Figure he made, in tho&s;e odd kind of Cloaths, which the poor Fryers had equipp'd him with, and that his long Beard and an uncomb'd Wigg added much to the Di&s;gui&s;e; he was re&s;olved to put on the be&s;t Face, he could, in tho&s;e aukward Circum|&s;tances, and &s;tepp'd into the fir&s;t Barber's Shop he came at to be trimm'd and get his Wigg comb'd and powder'd. This proved a very lucky Thought to him; for as &s;oon as he &s;tepp'd into the fir&s;t Barber's Shop, who
<PB N="234" REF="260">
&s;hould prove to be the Ma&s;ter of it, but one <HI>Tobit Yeats,</HI> who had &s;erved him in the &s;ame Capacity at <HI>London,</HI> and was but newly &s;et up in the Trade of a Barber-Surgeon at <HI>Hamp|ton Town,</HI> and followed likewi&s;e the Profe&s;|&s;ion of School-ma&s;ter. This <HI>Tobit Yeates</HI> had &s;haved him quite, before he knew him in that Di&s;gui&s;e; and Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> though he knew him pre&s;ently, had a mind to try if he &s;hould be known him&s;elf fir&s;t: At length the Barber finding him to be a dumb Man by his ordering every thing with Motions of the Hand, and Ge&s;tures of the Body, look'd at him very earne&s;tly, remember'd him, and in a great Surprize, called for Pen, Ink and Pa|per, and begg'd to know how he came to be in that Di&s;gui&s;e; whether he was under any Misfortune, and Apprehen&s;ion of being di&s;|cover'd, that made him go in &s;o poor and &s;o clowni&s;h a Habit, and tender'd him any Ser|vices, as far as his little Capacity would reach, and de&s;ir'd him to be free, and command him; if he was able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any thing. The&s;e were the mo&s;t comfortable Words, that <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> had read a great while. He took the Pen and Paper in his turn; re|lated to him his whole Story, gave the poor Barber thanks for his good natured Offer, and &s;aid he would make &s;o much u&s;e of it, as to be indebted to him for &s;o much Money as would pay the Stage Coach, and bear him in his travelling Expences up to <HI>London,</HI> from
<PB N="235" REF="261">
whence he would &s;peedily return the Favour with Intere&s;t. The poor hone&s;t Fellow, out of Gratitude to a Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Liberality he had formerly experienc'd, immediately furni&s;h'd Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> with that little Supply, expre&s;&s;ing the Gladne&s;s of his Heart that it lay in his Power; and the Stage Coach being to &s;et out within but a few Hours, he ran in&s;tantly to the Inn to &s;ee if he could get him a Place. By good luck there was Room, and but ju&s;t Room for one more, which pleas'd <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> mightily when he was ac|quainted with it by his true and tru&s;ty Ser|vant the Barber; for he was as impatient to &s;ee <HI>London</HI> again, it &s;eems, as he had been before to quit it. Well, he had his Wi&s;h; and when he came to <HI>London,</HI> he had one Wi&s;h more for Fortune to be&s;tow upon him, which appear'd to begin to grow kind again, after her fickle Fit of Cruelty was over; and this Wi&s;h was, that he might find his former Lodgings empty, and live in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, as he did, when he follow'd his Pro&s;e&s;&s;ion. This too &s;ucceeded according to his De&s;ire, and he was happily fix'd once more to his Heart's Content in his old Re&s;idence, with the &s;ame People of the Hou&s;e round about him, who bore him all that Re&s;pect and Af|fection (and &s;hew'd all that Readine&s;s and Willingne&s;s to &s;erve him on every Occa&s;ion and at every turn) which could be expected from Per&s;ons, that let Lodgings in Town to

a Gentleman, whom they e&s;teem'd the be&s;t Tenant they ever had in their Lives or ever could have.</P>
<P>Immediately the Tidings of the dumb Gen|tleman's being return'd home from beyond Sea, &s;pread throughout all the Neighbour|hood, and it was nois'd about from one Nigh|bourhood to another, till it went through all Ranks and Conditions, and was known as well in a Day or Two's Time, all the Town over, as if he had been &s;ome great Man be|longing to the State, and his Arrival had been notified to the Publick in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> as a Per&s;on of the la&s;t Importance. And &s;uch a Per&s;on he appear'd indeed to be taken for, e|&s;pecially among the fair Sex, who throng'd to his Doors, Croud after Croud, to con&s;ult with him, about their future Occurrences in Life.</P>
<P>The&s;e curious Tribes of People, were as various in their Per&s;ons, Sex, Age, Quality, Profe&s;&s;ion, Art, Trade, as they were in the Curio&s;ity of their Minds, and the Que&s;tions they had intended to propound to this <HI>dumb Predictor</HI> of &s;trange Events, that lay yet as Embrio's in the Womb of Time, and were not to come, &s;ome of them, to a Maturity for Birth, for very many Years after, ju&s;t as por|celain Clay is &s;tored up in the Earth by good Artificers, which their Heirs make <HI>China</HI> of half a Century, and &s;ometimes more than an Age, afterwards.</P>

The&s;e Shoals of Cu&s;tomers, who were to fee him well for his Advice as we may &s;up|po&s;e, now he &s;tood in need of rai&s;ing a fre&s;h Stock, were unque&s;tionably, as welcome and acceptable to him, as they appeared too trouble&s;ome to him before, when he was in a State of more Wealth and Plenty.</P>
<P>Fortune, that does nothing moderately, &s;eem'd now re&s;olv'd, as &s;he had been ex|treamly cruel before, to be extreamly kind to him. He had nothing to do from early in the Morning till late at Night, but to read Que&s;tions, and re&s;olve them as fa&s;t, as much frequented Doctors write their Pre|&s;criptions and Recipe's, and like them al|&s;o to receive Fees as fa&s;t. Fortune was in|deed mightily indulgent to the Wants &s;he had &s;o &s;uddenly reduc'd him to, and reliev'd him as &s;uddenly by the&s;e <HI>Knots</HI> of <HI>Curio&s;o's,</HI> who brought him a Glut of Money. But one &s;ingle fair Lady, that was one of his very fir&s;t Con&s;ulters after his Return, and who had receiv'd &s;atisfactory An&s;wers from him in o|ther Points, before he went abroad; prov'd (&s;o good Fortune would have it) worth all the re&s;t of his Cu&s;tomers together, as nume|rous as they were, and as I have accordingly repre&s;ented them.</P>
<P>This Lady was the Relict or Widow of a Gentleman of a good E&s;tate, and of a very good Family, who&s;e Name was <HI>Digby,</HI> and a hand&s;ome Jointure &s;he had out of the E|&s;tate. This Lady, it &s;eems, having been with
<PB N="238" REF="264">
him in former Days, and &s;een him in a more &s;hining Way of Life, (for he had taken a Humour to appear before all his Company in that coar&s;e odd Dre&s;s, made out of the Fryer's Habit, and would not be per&s;waded by the People of the Hou&s;e to put on a Nightgown, till he could provide him&s;elf with a new Suit) was &s;o curious, among other Que&s;tions, as to ask him, whether he had met with any Misfortunes, and how he came to be in &s;o &s;lovenly and wretched a Habit? Here Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> related the whole Story of his Tra|vels to her, and the Cro&s;&s;es and Di&s;appoint|ments he had met with abroad. The Tears, he ob&s;erv'd, would &s;tart every now and then into her Eyes, when &s;he came to any doleful Pa&s;&s;age, and &s;he appear'd to have a mighty compa&s;&s;ionate kind of feeling, when &s;he read of any Hard&s;hip more than ordinarily me|lancholy, that had befallen him. Mr. <HI>Camp|bell,</HI> it is certain, had then a very good Pre|&s;ence, and was a hand&s;ome and portly young Man; and, as a great many young Gentle|men derive the &s;eeming Agreeablene&s;s of their Per&s;ons from the Taylor and Perruque-ma|ker, the Shoe-maker and Ho&s;ier, &s;o Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s Per&s;on on the other Hand gave a good Air and a good Look to the aukward Garb he had on; and I believe, it was from &s;eeing him in this odd Trim (as they call it,) the Ladies fir&s;t took up the humour of calling him <HI>the hand&s;ome Sloven:</HI> Add to this that
<PB N="239" REF="265">
he look'd his Misfortune in the Face with a jolly Countenance, and &s;miled even while he was penning the Relation of his Calamities: All which are certainly Circum&s;tances that fir&s;t &s;ooth a generous Mind into a State of Compa&s;&s;ion, and afterwards heighten it in the Brea&s;t wherein it is conceiv'd. Hence it came that this pretty and good natur'd Widow, Mrs. <HI>Digby,</HI> when &s;he had expre&s;s'd her Com|mi&s;eration of him by her Looks, began to take the Pen and expre&s;s it in very tender Terms: Neither did &s;he think that Expre&s;&s;ion in Words a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of the Com|pa&s;&s;ion &s;he bore to him; the Genero&s;ity of her Mind did lead her to expre&s;s it in a more &s;ub&s;tantial manner &s;till, and that was to &s;hew it plainly by a very benevolous Action. She laid a Pur&s;e of Twenty Guineas before the Table, and at the &s;ame time &s;miling, point|ed to the Table, as &s;ignifying her de&s;ire that he would accept it, and running to the Door drop'd a Curte&s;y, and skuttled away; and by the &s;ame civil Act as &s;he oblig'd him, &s;he put it out of his Power to refu&s;e being &s;o ob|liged; &s;o that, though the Pre&s;ent was very hand&s;ome, the manner of giving it was &s;till hand&s;omer. If being a hand&s;ome young Man of Merit in Di&s;tre&s;s, and bearing his Misfor|tunes with an equal Mind, are powerful Mo|tives to excite Compa&s;&s;ion in the Mind of a generous Lady, &s;o the Genero&s;ity of a young agreeable Widow expre&s;s'd in &s;o kind and &s;o
<PB N="240" REF="266">
benevolous a Way, to a young Gentleman, when he had been ta&s;ting nothing but the bitter Draughts of Fortune before, mu&s;t &s;tir up an Affection in a Mind that had any &s;en&s;e of Gratitude: And truly ju&s;t &s;uch was the Effect that this Lady's Civility had upon Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell.</HI> He conceiv'd, from that Moment, a very great Affection for her; and re&s;olv'd to try whether he could gain her, which he had no &s;mall Grounds to hope, from the E&s;teem, which &s;he appear'd to bear to|wards him already. I remember Mr. <HI>Dry|den</HI> makes a very beautiful Ob&s;ervation of the near Alliance there is between the Two Pa&s;&s;ions of Pity and Love in a Woman's Brea&s;t, in one of his Plays. His Words are the&s;e: <HI>For Pity &s;till fore-runs approaching Love As Light'ning does the Thunder.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bruyere</HI> a mo&s;t ingenious Member of the <HI>French</HI> A|cademy has made another Remark, which comes home to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. He &s;ays, <HI>That many Women love their Money better than their Friends; but yet value their Lovers more than their Money.</HI> According to the Two Re|flections of the&s;e fine Writers upon the Tem|pers of the Fair, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had hopes e|nough to ground his Court&s;hip upon; and it appeared &s;o in the End by his proving Suc|ce&s;sful: She from being a very liberal and friendly Client, became at la&s;t a mo&s;t Affe|ctionate Wife. He then began to be a Hou&s;e|keeper, and accordingly took a little neat one,
<PB N="241" REF="267">
and very commodious for his Profe&s;&s;ion, in <HI>Monmouth</HI> Court. Here I mu&s;t take leave to make this Ob&s;ervation; That, if Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> inherited the Talents of his &s;econd|&s;ighted Mother, he &s;eem'd likewi&s;e to be an Heir to his Father Mr. <HI>Archibald Campbell,</HI> both in his &s;trange and accidental Sufferings by Sea, and likewi&s;e in his being reliev'd from them, after as accidental and &s;trange a man|ner, by an unexpected Marriage, ju&s;t like his Father's. And here we return again to take a new Survey of him in the cour&s;e of his publick Practice as a Predictor. The Ac|counts I &s;hall give of his Actions here, will be very various in their Nature from any I have yet pre&s;ented to the Reader; they are more my&s;terious in them&s;elves, and yet I &s;hall en|deavour to make the manner of his operating in this kind as plain as (I think) I have the foregoing ones, and then I flatter my &s;elf they mu&s;t afford a fre&s;h Entertainment for every Reader, that has any curio&s;ity and a good ta&s;te for things of &s;o extraordi|nary a Kind. For what I have all along pro|pounded to my&s;elf from the beginning, and in the progre&s;s to the end of this Hi&s;tory, is, to interweave entertaining and &s;urpri&s;ing Narratives of what Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> has done, with curious and in&s;tructive Enquiries into the nature of tho&s;e Actions, for which he has rendred him&s;elf &s;o &s;ingularly famous. It was not therefore &s;uitable to my purpo&s;e, to clog
<PB N="242" REF="268">
the Reader with numerous Adventures al|mo&s;t all of the &s;ame Kind, but out of a va&s;t number of them to &s;ingle &s;ome few of tho&s;e that were mo&s;t remarkable, and that were My&s;teries, but My&s;teries of very different &s;orts. I leave that Method of &s;welling di&s;torted and commented Trifles into Volumes, to the writers of Fable and Romance; if I was to tell his Adventures with regard, for Exam|ple, to Women that came to con&s;ult him, I might perhaps have not only written the Stories of eleven thou&s;and Virgins that died Maids, but have had Relations to give of as many marry'd Women and Widows, and the Work would have been endle&s;s. All that I &s;hall do therefore is to pick out one parti|cular each of a different Kind, that there may be variety in the Entertainment. Upon Ap|plication to this Dumb Man, one is told in the middle of her Health, that &s;he &s;hall die at &s;uch a time; another, that &s;he &s;hall &s;icken, and upon the moment of her recovery, have a Suiter and a Husband; a Third, who is a celebrated Beauty with a multitude of Ad|mirers round about her, that &s;he &s;hall never become a Wife; a Fourth that is marry'd, when &s;he &s;hall get rid of an unea&s;y Husband; a Fifth that hath lo&s;t her Goods, who &s;tole them, where and when they &s;hall be re&s;to|red; a Sixth, that is a Merchant, when he &s;hall be Undone, and how and when he &s;hall recover his Lo&s;&s;es, and be as great on
<PB N="243" REF="269">
the <HI>Exchange</HI> as ever; a &s;eventh, that is a Game&s;ter, which will be his winning and which his lo&s;ing Hour; an eighth, how he &s;hall be involv'd in a Law-&s;uit, and whether the Suit will have an adver&s;e or a pro&s;perous I&s;&s;ue; a ninth, that is a Woman, with choice of Lovers, which &s;he &s;hall be mo&s;t happy with for Life; and &s;o on to many others, where every Prediction is perfectly new and &s;urprizing, and differs from the o|ther in almo&s;t every Circum&s;tance. When a Man has &s;o exten&s;ive a Genius as this at foretelling the future Occurrences of Life, one Narrative of a &s;ort is enough in Con|&s;cience to pre&s;ent the Reader with, and &s;e|veral of each kind would not methinks be entertaining, but tire&s;ome; for he that can do one thing in the&s;e kinds by the power of Prediction, can do ten thou&s;and; and tho&s;e who are ob&s;tinate in extenuating his Talents, and calling his Capacity in que&s;tion, and that will not be convinc'd by one In|&s;tance of his Judgment, would not own the conviction if ten thou&s;and In&s;tances were given them. The be&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages I can recom|mend to their Peru&s;al, are tho&s;e, where Per|&s;ons, who came purpo&s;ely to banter him under the colour of con&s;ulting him, and cover'd over their &s;ly Intentions with bor|row'd Di&s;gui&s;es, and came in Ma&s;querades, found all the Je&s;t turn'd upon them&s;elves in the End, which they meant to our famous
<PB N="244" REF="270">
Predictor, and had the di&s;couragement of &s;eeing their mo&s;t conceal'd and deepe&s;t laid Plots di&s;covered, and all their mo&s;t witty Fetches and wily Contrivances defeated, till they were compelled univer&s;ally to acknow|ledge, that endeavouring to impo&s;e upon the Judgment of our <HI>Seer,</HI> by any hidden Artifice and Cunning what&s;oever, was effec|tually impo&s;ing upon their own. His unu|&s;ual Talent in this kind was &s;o openly known, and &s;o generally confe&s;s'd, that his Know|ledge was celebrated in &s;ome of the mo&s;t witty Weekly Papers that ever appear'd in Publick. <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff,</HI> who diverted all the <HI>Beaumond</HI> for a long &s;pace of time with his Lucubrations, takes occa&s;ion in &s;everal of his Papers, to applaud the Speculations of this dumb Gentleman in an admirable vein of Plea&s;antry and Humour, peculiar to the Writer, and to the Subject he writ upon. And when that bright Author, who join'd the uttermo&s;t Facetiou&s;ne&s;s with the mo&s;t &s;olid Improvements of Morality and Learn|ing in his Works, laid a&s;ide the Title of a <HI>Tatler,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed the Name of a <HI>Specta|tor</HI> and Cen&s;or of Men's Actions, he &s;till every now and then thought our <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> a Subject worthy enough to em|ploy his farther Con&s;iderations upon. I mu&s;t take notice of one Letter &s;ent concerning him to the <HI>Spectator,</HI> in the Year, 1712, which was at a time when a Lady wanted

Let us take a Survey of him while he is wonderfully curing Per&s;ons la|bouring under the misfortune of Witchcraft, of which the following Story will be an emi|ment In&s;tance, and likewi&s;e clear up how he came by his Reputation in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as menti|oned in the above-mentioned Letter to the <HI>Spectator.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1709, <HI>Su&s;anna John&s;on,</HI> Daughter to one Captain <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who liv'd at a place adjacent to <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> going one Morning to that Town to buy Butter at the Market, was met there by an old mi&s;erable-looking Woman, ju&s;t as &s;he had taken &s;ome of her Change of the Mar|ketwoman
<PB N="248" REF="274">
in Copper, and this old Woman rather demanded than begg'd the Gentle|woman to give her a Penny. Mrs. <HI>John&s;on</HI> reputing her to be one of tho&s;e hateful People that are call'd &s;turdy Beggars, refu&s;ed it her, as thinking it to be no act of Charity, and that it would be rather gratifying and indul|ging her Impudence, than &s;upplying or &s;a|tisfying her Indigence. Upon the refu&s;al, the old Hag with a Face more wrinkl'd &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, by Anger, than it was by Age, took upon her to &s;torm at young Mrs. <HI>John|&s;on</HI> very loudly, and to threaten and me|nace her: But when &s;he found her common Threats and Menaces were of no avail, &s;he &s;wore &s;he would be reveng'd of the young Creature in &s;o &s;ignal a manner, that &s;he &s;hould repent the Denial of that Penny from her Heart before &s;he got home, and that it &s;hould co&s;t her many Pounds to get rid of the Con&s;equences of that Denial and her Anger. The poor innocent Girl de&s;pi&s;ed the&s;e la&s;t words likewi&s;e, and getting up on Hor&s;eback, return'd Homewards; But ju&s;t as &s;he got about half way her Hor&s;e &s;top'd, and no means that &s;he could u&s;e would make him advance one &s;ingle &s;tep; but &s;he &s;taid a while to &s;ee if that would humour him to go on. At la&s;t the Bea&s;t began to grow unruly, and &s;norted and trembled as if he had &s;een or &s;melt &s;omething that frighted him, and &s;o fell a kicking de&s;perately till he threw
<PB N="249" REF="275">
the Girl from the Saddle, not being able to cling to it any longer, tho' a pretty good Hor&s;ewoman of her Years; &s;o much were the Hor&s;e's Motions and Plungings more than ordinarily violent.</P>
<P>As Providence would have it, &s;he got not much harm by the Fall, receiving only a little Brui&s;e in the right Shoulder; but &s;he was dreadfully frighted. This Fear added Wings to her Feet, and brought her home as &s;peedily of her&s;elf as &s;he u&s;ually came on Hor&s;eback. She immediately, without any other &s;ign of Illne&s;s than the pallid Colour with which Fear had di&s;order'd the Com|plexion of her Face, alarm'd all the Family at home with the Story, took her Bed up|on it, complain'd of inward Rackings of the Belly, and was never at ca&s;e unle&s;s &s;he lay doubled up together her Head to her Knees, and her Heels to her Rump, ju&s;t like a Fi|gure of 8. She could not be a &s;ingle Mo|ment out of that Po&s;ture without &s;hrieking out with the violence of anxious Torments and racking Pains.</P>
<P>In this condition of Mi&s;ery, amid&s;t this a|gony of Suffering, and in this double Po|&s;ture, was the poor wretched young Gentle|woman brought to Town; Phy&s;icians were con&s;ulted about her, but in vain; &s;he was carry'd to different Ho&s;pitals for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but their Endeavours likewi&s;e prov'd ineffec|tual: At la&s;t &s;he was conducted to the Col|lege
<PB N="250" REF="276">
of Phy&s;icians; and even the collective Wi&s;dom of the greate&s;t Sages and Adepts in the Science of Phy&s;ick was pos'd to give her any Pre&s;cription that would do her &s;ervice, and relieve her from the inexplicable Ma|lady &s;he labour'd under. The poor incurable Creature was one con&s;tant Subject of her com|plaining Mother's Di&s;cour&s;e in every Company &s;he came into. It hapned at la&s;t, and very pro|videntially truly, that the Mother was thus condoling the Misfortune of her Child among five or &s;ix Ladies, and telling them among other things, that by the mo&s;t skilful Per&s;ons &s;he was look'd upon to be bewitch'd, and that 'twas not within the power of Phy&s;ick to compa&s;s her Recovery: They all having been acquainted with our Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed her to carry her Daugh|ter to his Hou&s;e and con&s;ult with him a|bout her. The Mother was overjoy'd at the&s;e tidings, and purpo&s;ed to let no time &s;lip where her Child's Health was &s;o deeply con|cerned. She got the Ladies to go with her and her Child, to be Eye-witne&s;&s;es of &s;o ex|traordinary a piece of Practice, and &s;o emi|nent a trial of Skill.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this di&s;mal Object was brought into his Room, Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> lifted up her Head and look'd earne&s;tly in her Face, and in le&s;s than a Minute's time &s;ignify'd to the Company, that &s;he was not only be|witch'd, but in as dreadful a Condition al|mo&s;t
<PB N="251" REF="277">
as the Man that had a Legion of Fiends within him.</P>
<P>At the reading of the&s;e words the unhap|py Creature rais'd up her Head, turn'd her Eyes upwards, and a Smile (a thing &s;he had been a &s;tranger to for many Months) over&s;pread her whole Face, and &s;uch a kind of Colour as is the flu&s;hing of Joy and Gladne&s;s, and with an innocent tone of Voice &s;he &s;aid, &s;he <HI>now had a firm belief &s;he &s;hould &s;hortly be deliver'd.</HI> The Mother and the re&s;t of the Company were all in Tears, but Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> wrote to them that they &s;hould be of good Heart, be ea&s;y and quiet for a few Mo|ments, and they &s;hould be convinc'd that it was Witchcraft, but happily convinc'd by &s;ee|ing her &s;o &s;uddenly well again. This brought the Company into pretty good Temper; and a little after, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> de&s;ir'd &s;he might be led up Stairs into his Chamber and left there alone with him for a little while; this occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;mall Female Specula|tion, and as much Mirth as their late Sor|row, alleviated with the hopes of her Cure, would permit.</P>
<P>This you may be &s;ure was but a &s;natch of Mirth, ju&s;t as the nature of the thing would allow of; and all &s;orts of Waggery being laid in&s;tantly a&s;ide, and remov'd almo&s;t as &s;oon as conceiv'd, the poor young thing was carry'd in that double Po&s;ture up Stairs. She had not been much above half an Hour there,
<PB N="252" REF="278">
when by the help only of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Arm &s;he was led down Stairs, and de&s;cended into that Room full of Company as a Miracle appearing in a Machine from above; &s;he was led backward and forward in the Room, while all gaz'd at her for a while with joyful A&s;to|ni&s;hment, for no Arrow was ever more &s;trait than &s;he. Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> then prevail'd with her to drink a gla&s;s of Wine, and immedi|ately after &s;he evacuated Wind, which &s;he had not done for &s;ome Months before, and found her&s;elf &s;till more amended and ea&s;y: And then the Mother making Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> &s;ome &s;mall Acknowledgment at that time, with the promi&s;e of more, and her Daugh|ter giving Thanks, and all the Company com|mending his Skill, took their Leaves and de|parted with great demon&s;trations of Joy. I &s;hall here, to cut the Story &s;hort, &s;ignify, that &s;he came frequently afterwards to make her Te&s;timonials of Gratitude to him, and con|tinues to enjoy her Health to this very Day at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where &s;he now lives, and will at any time, if call'd upon, make Oath of the Truth of this little Hi&s;tory, as &s;he told me her&s;elf with her own Mouth.</P>
<P>The next thing therefore it behoves me to do in this Chapter is, to give &s;ome &s;atisfactory account of Magick, by which &s;uch &s;eeming my&s;terious Cures and Operations are brought about.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="279">
This Task I would perform in the mo&s;t per&s;picuous and mo&s;t convincing manner I can; for Magick I know is held to be a very hard and difficult Study by tho&s;e Learned, and univer&s;ally unlawful and diabolical by tho&s;e Unlearned, who believe there is &s;uch a Science attainable by Human Genius. On the other hand, by &s;ome Learned Men, who believe there is no &s;uch Science, it is repre|&s;ented as an incon&s;i&s;tent Sy&s;tem of Super&s;ti|tions and Chimera's; and again laugh'd at as &s;uch by the Unlearned, who are of an incre|dulous Temper: What I would therefore undertake to do in this place, is to &s;hew the Learned Men, who believe there is &s;uch an Art, that the attainment to a tolerable Know|ledge of the manner how magical Practices may be brought about, is no &s;uch difficult Matter as they have repre&s;ented it to them|&s;elves; and by doing this, I &s;hall make the Sy&s;tem of it <HI>&s;o plain,</HI> that while the Learn|ed approve of it, the Unlearned too, who are not of an unbelieving Kind, may under|&s;tand clearly what I &s;ay; and the Learned Men who have rejected this Science as <HI>chi|merical,</HI> may be clearly convinced it is <HI>real;</HI> and then there is nothing left but ob&s;tinate unbelieving Ignorance, which I &s;hall not here pretend by Arguments to lead into Sen&s;e, but leave it to the work of Time. In fine, I will endeavour to induce Men of Sen&s;e to &s;ay, that, what has been accounted my&s;teri|ous,
<PB N="254" REF="280">
is deliver'd in a plain, ea&s;y, and convin|cing manner, and to own that they approve, while Men of the lower Cla&s;s of Under|&s;tanding, &s;hall confe&s;s and acknowledge that they them&s;elves under&s;tand it, and that what has hitherto been repre&s;ented as arduous and difficult to a great Genius, is adapted and ren|der'd not only clear, but familiar to Per&s;ons of midling Talents. In this Work therefore I &s;hall follow the &s;tricte&s;t Order I can (which of all things render a Di&s;cour&s;e upon any Subject the mo&s;t clear;) and that it may be plain to the commone&s;t Capacity, I will fir&s;t &s;et down what Order I intend to follow.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I will &s;peak of Magick in general.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Of Magick under its &s;everal Di|vi&s;ions and Subdivi&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Concerning the Object of Art, as it is Good or Bad.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Of the Per&s;ons exerci&s;ing that Art in either Capacity of Good or Bad, and by what means they become capacitated to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fifth</HI> place, I &s;hall come to the &s;everal Objections again&s;t the Art of Magick, and the Refutation of tho&s;e Objections.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Objection &s;hall be again&s;t the Ex|i&s;tence of good and bad Spirits. The Refu|tation of which will con&s;i&s;t in my proving the Exi&s;tences of Spirits both Good and Bad, by Rea&s;on, and by Experience.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="281">
The &s;econd Objection that will be brought, is to contain an Allegation that there are no &s;uch Per&s;ons as Witches now, and an Ar|gument to &s;upport that Allegation, drawn from the Incapacity and Impo&s;&s;ibility of any thing's making (while it&s;elf is incarnate) a Contract with a Spirit. This Objection will be an&s;wer'd by proving the reality of Wit|ches from almo&s;t Univer&s;al Experience, and by explaining rationally the manner how the Devils hold Commerce with Witches; which Explication is back'd and authoriz'd by the Opinion of the mo&s;t Eminent Divines and the mo&s;t Learned Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>From hence, <HI>Sixthly</HI> and la&s;tly, We &s;hall conclude on the &s;ide of the good Magick, that as there are Witches on the one hand that may afflict and torment Per&s;ons with Daemons, &s;o on the other hand there are lawful and good Magicians that may ca&s;t out Daemons from People that are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with them.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> as to <HI>Magick</HI> in general; <HI>Ma|gick</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Spirit by Faith, for Faith is that MAGNET of the Magicians by which they draw Spirits to them, and by which Spirits they do great things, that ap|pear like Miracles.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Magick</HI> is divided into three &s;orts, viz. <HI>Divine, Natural,</HI> and <HI>Diabolical.</HI> And Natural <HI>Magick</HI> is again &s;ub-divided in|to two kinds, Simple and Compound: And Natural Compound <HI>Magick</HI> is again likewi&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="282">
divided into two Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Natural-di|vine <HI>Magick,</HI> and Natural-diabolical <HI>Magick.</HI> Now, to give the Reader a clear, and a di&s;tinct Notion of each &s;everal Species of <HI>Magick</HI> here mentioned, I &s;et down the following De|finitions.&mdash;Divine <HI>Magick</HI> is a Cele&s;tial Sci|ence, in which all Operations, that are won|derfully brought about, are performed by the Spirit of God.&mdash;Natural <HI>Magick</HI> is a Science, in which all the my&s;terious Acts that are wrought, are compa&s;s'd by Natural Spirits.&mdash;But as this Natural <HI>Magick</HI> may be exerci&s;ed about things either in a manner indifferent in them&s;elves, or mere morally Good, and then it is mere natural <HI>Magick;</HI> or el&s;e about things Theologically good, and tran&s;cendently bad; and then it is not mere|ly and Natural <HI>Magick,</HI> but Mix'd and Com|pound. If Natural <HI>Magick</HI> be exerci&s;ed a|bout the mo&s;t holy Operations, it is then mix'd with the Divine, and may then be cal|led, not improperly, Natural-divine Magick. But if Natural <HI>Magick</HI> troubles it&s;elf about compa&s;&s;ing the wickede&s;t Practices, then is it promi&s;cuous with the <HI>Demoniacal,</HI> and may not improperly be called Natural dia|bolical <HI>Magick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Object of this Art is doing Wonders out of the ordinary appearing cour&s;e of Nature, which tend either to great good or bad, by the help and Mediation of Spirits good and bad.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="283">
<HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to the Per&s;ons exerci&s;ing that Art in either way, whether good or bad, and by what Means they become capaci|tated to act it, the Notion of this may be ea&s;ily deduced from the Notions of the Art it&s;elf, as con&s;idered above in its each diffe|rent Species; for as all Magick con&s;i&s;ts in a Spirit, every Magician acts by a Spirit.</P>
<P>Divine Magicians that are of God are &s;poke of in the &s;acred Book, and therefore I &s;hall not mention the Pa&s;&s;ages here, but pa&s;s them over (as ought in a Book like this) with a profound and reverential Silence, as well as the other Pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;peak of Natural and Daemoniacal Magicians; and in all I &s;hall &s;peak of them in this Place, I &s;hall only &s;peak of them with Regard to humane Rea|&s;on and Experience, and conclude this Head with &s;aying, that <HI>Natural Magicians work all Things by the Natural Spirits of the Ele|ments;</HI> but that <HI>Witches and Daemoniacal Magicians,</HI> as <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambers</HI> in <HI>Aegypt</HI> were, <HI>work their magical Performances by the Spirit of Daemons,</HI> and 'tis by the Means of the&s;e <HI>different Spirits</HI> that the&s;e <HI>diffe|rent Magicians</HI> perform their <HI>different</HI> Ope|rations.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things thus di&s;tinctly &s;ettled and ex|plained, 'tis now we mu&s;t come and ground the Di&s;pute, between tho&s;e who believe there are no &s;uch Things as <HI>Magicians</HI> of any Kind,
<PB N="258" REF="284">
and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert there are of all the Kinds above &s;pecify'd.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who contend there are, have re|cour&s;e to Experience, and relate many well|witne&s;s'd Narratives, to prove, that there have been in all Times, and that there are &s;till Magicians of all the&s;e Kinds: But tho&s;e, who contend that there are no &s;uch Per&s;ons, will give no ear to what the others call plain Ex|perience; they call the Stories (let whatever Witne&s;&s;es appear to ju&s;tify them) either fa|bulous Legends invented by the Authors, or el&s;e Tricks of intellectual <HI>Logerdemain</HI> im|po&s;ed by the Actors, upon the Relators of tho&s;e Actions. Since therefore (they &s;ay) tho' the Believers in Magick bragg of Expe|rience never &s;o much, it may be but a fal|lible Experience; they rea&s;onably de&s;ire to know, whether the&s;e Gentlemen that &s;tand for Magick can an&s;wer the Objections which they propo&s;e, to prove, that the Practice of Magick, according to the Sy&s;tem laid down, is incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, before they will yield their A&s;&s;ent. Let the Stories be never &s;o numerous, appear never&s;o credible, the&s;e un|believing Gentlemen de&s;ire to be try'd by Rea|&s;on, and aver till that Rea&s;on is given; they will not be convinc'd by the <HI>Number</HI> of Sto|ries, becau&s;e, tho' numerous, they are Stories &s;till, neither will they believe them becau&s;e they appear credible; becau&s;e &s;eeming &s;o is
<PB N="259" REF="285">
not being &s;o, and Appearances, tho' never &s;o fair, when they contradict Rea&s;on, are not to be &s;wallowed down with an implicit Faith as &s;o many Realities. And thus far, no doubt, the Gentlemen, who are on the unbelieving Side, are very much in the right on't. The learned Gentlemen on the other hand, who are per&s;uaded of this mighty my&s;terious Pow|er, being lodged in the Hands of Magicians, an&s;wer, that they will take upon them to re|fute the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Objections brought by the learned Unbelievers, and to reconcile the Practicability of magical My&s;teries by the Ca|pacity of Men, who &s;tudy that Art, to <HI>right Rules</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of Rea&s;oning, and to &s;hew, that &s;ome Stories (tho' never &s;o prodigi|ous) which are told of Magicians, demand the Belief of wi&s;e Men on two Accounts; becau&s;e as Experience backs Rea&s;on on the one hand, Rea&s;on backs Experience on the other, and &s;o the I&s;&s;ue of the whole Argu|ment (whether there are Magicians or not) is thrown upon both Experience and Rea&s;on. The&s;e Arguments on each &s;ide, I &s;hall draw up fairly <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con;</HI> for I don't pretend to be the Inventor of them my &s;elf, they belong to other Authors many Years ago; be it enough for me to boa&s;t of, if I can draw them up in a better and clo&s;er Form together, than they have yet appeared in: In that I take upon my &s;elf a very great Task; I erect my &s;elf as it were into a kind of a <HI>Judge;</HI> I will &s;um up the
<PB N="260" REF="286">
Evidences on both &s;ides, and I &s;hall, where|ever I &s;ee Occa&s;ion, intimate which &s;ide of the Argument bears the mo&s;t Weight with me; but when I have enforced my Opinion as far as I think needful, my Readers like a Jury are &s;till at Liberty to bring in their Ver|dict, ju&s;t as they them&s;elves &s;hall &s;ee fit; and this naturally leads me, where I promi&s;ed to come to in the fifth Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, to the &s;everal Objections again&s;t the Power of Art Magick, and the Refutation of tho&s;e Objections.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="objections">
<HEAD>The fir&s;t Objections being again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of Spirits, and the Refutations thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t Objection, which they who reject Magick make u&s;e of, is, deny|ing that there are any &s;uch Things as Spirits about which, &s;ince tho&s;e, who defend the Art, &s;ay it intirely exerci&s;eth it&s;elf, the Ob|jectors contend, that if they can make out that there are no &s;uch Beings as Spirits, all Preten&s;ions to the Art mu&s;t be intirely ground|le&s;s, and for the future exploded.</P>
<P>To make this Part out, that there are no Spirits, the fir&s;t Man they produce on their Side is undoubtedly one of very great Cre|dit and Authority, ina&s;much as he has ju&s;tly born for many Centuries the Title of a
<PB N="261" REF="287">
Prince of Philo&s;ophers. They &s;ay, that <HI>Ari&s;to|tle</HI> in his Book <HI>de Mundo,</HI> rea&s;ons thus again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of Spirits, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ince God can do all Things of him&s;elf, he doth not &s;tand in Need of mini&s;tring Angels and Dae|mons. A Multitude of Servants &s;hewing the Weakne&s;s of a Prince.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, who defend, the Science make this Reply, they allow the Credit and Authority of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> as much as the Ob|jectors: But as the Objectors them&s;elves, de|ny all the Authorities for the Spirits, and de|&s;ire that Rea&s;on may be the only Ground they go upon; &s;o the Refuters, on their Parts, de&s;ire, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> may not be ab&s;olutely pa&s;s'd upon them for Argument, but that his Words may be brought to the &s;ame Touch&s;tone of Rea&s;on, and proved if they are Standard. If this Argument, &s;ay they, will hold good, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;hould not &s;uppo&s;e Intelligencies moving the Caele&s;tial Spheres; for God &s;ufficeth to move all with|out mini&s;tring Spirits; nor would there be Need of a Sun in the World, for God can enlighten all Things by him&s;elf, and &s;o all &s;econd Cau&s;es were to be taken away; there|fore there are Angels and mini&s;tring Spirits in the World, for the Maje&s;ty of God, not for his Want of them, and for Order, not for his Omnipotency. And here, if the Ob|jectors return and &s;ay, who told you that there are Spirits? Is not yours a precarious
<PB N="262" REF="288">
Hypothe&s;is? Mayn't we have leave to recri|minate in this Place? Pray, who told <HI>Ari&s;to|tle</HI> that there were Intelligencies that moved the Caele&s;tial Spheres? Is not this Hypothe&s;is as precarious as any Man may pretend that of Spirits to be? And we believe there are few Philo&s;ophers at pre&s;ent, who agree with <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in that Opinion; and we dare pro|nounce this to be ours, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> took his Intelligencies from the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> who went according to the &s;ame whim&s;ical, tho' pretty Notion, which fir&s;t gave Ri&s;e to the Fiction of the Nine Mu&s;es: But more than all this, it is a very great Doubt among learned Men, whe|ther this Book <HI>de Mundo</HI> be <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s or no.</P>
<P>The next Thing the Objectors bring a|gain&s;t the Exi&s;tence of Spirits, is, that it is Non&s;en&s;e for Men to &s;ay that there are &s;uch Beings of which it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man to have any Notion, and they in&s;i&s;t up|on it that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to form an Idea of a &s;piritual Sub&s;tance. As to this part, the Defendants rejoin, that they think our late mo&s;t judicious Mr. <HI>Lock,</HI> in his cla|borate and fini&s;h'd E&s;&s;ay on humane Under|&s;tanding, has fairly made out, that Men have as clear a Notion of <HI>a &s;piritual Sub&s;tance</HI> as they have of <HI>any corporeal Sub&s;tance, Matter,</HI> or <HI>Body;</HI> and that there is as much Rea&s;on for admitting the Exi&s;tence of the <HI>one,</HI> as of the <HI>other;</HI> for that if they admit the <HI>latter,</HI> it is but Humour in them to deny the <HI>former.</HI> It
<PB N="263" REF="289">
is in Book the 2<HI>d, Chap.</HI> 29. where he rea|&s;ons thus: <Q REND="inline">"If a Man will examine him&s;elf, concerning his Notion of pure Sub&s;tance in general, he will find he has no other Idea of it, but only a Suppo&s;ition of he knows not what Support of &s;uch Quality which are ca|pable of producing &s;imple Ideas in us, which Qualities are commonly called Accidents. Thus if we talk or think of any particular &s;ort of corporeal Sub&s;tance, as <HI>Hor&s;e, Stone,</HI> &amp;c. tho' the Idea we have of either of them be but the Complication or Collection of tho&s;e &s;everal &s;imple Ideas, or &s;en&s;ible Quali|ties, which we u&s;e to find united in the Thing call'd <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> or <HI>Stone;</HI> yet becau&s;e we can|not conceive how they &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone not one in another, we &s;uppo&s;e them to ex|i&s;t in and be &s;upported by &s;ome common Sub|ject, which Support we denote by the Name of Sub&s;tance, tho' it be certain we have no clear or di&s;tinct Idea of that Thing we &s;up|po&s;e a Support.

wherein Thinking, Knowing, Doubting, and a Power of Moving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do &s;ub&s;i&s;t, we have as <HI>clear</HI> a Notion of the Nature or Sub&s;tance of <HI>Spirit,</HI> as we have of <HI>Body;</HI> the one being &s;nppo&s;ed to be (without knowing what is the <HI>Sub&s;tratum</HI> to tho&s;e &s;imple Ideas, which we have from without, and the other &s;uppo&s;ed (with a like Ignorance of what it is) to be the <HI>Sub&s;tratum</HI> of the&s;e Operations which we experiment in our&s;elves within). 'Tis plain then, that the Idea of corporeal Sub&s;tance in Matter, is as remote from our Concep|tions and Apprehen&s;ions as that of &s;piritual Sub&s;tance, and therefore from our not having any Notion of the Sub&s;tance of Spirit, we can no more conclude its not Exi&s;tence, than we can for the &s;ame Rea&s;on deny the Exi&s;tence of Body; it being as rational to affirm there is <HI>no Body,</HI> becau&s;e we cannot know its E&s;|&s;ence, as it's called, or have the Idea of the Sub&s;tance of Matter, as to &s;ay, there is no Spirit, becau&s;e we know not its E&s;&s;ence, or have no Idea of a &s;piritual Sub&s;tance."</Q> Mr. <HI>Lock</HI> al&s;o comparing our Idea of Spirit with our Idea of Body, thinks there may &s;eem ra|ther le&s;s Ob&s;curity in the former than the latter.

Pages, concerning the Apparitions of Spirits, I &s;hall refer the Reader back again to them, and only &s;ubjoin here one or two In&s;tances, which may, if required, be prov'd upon Oath, of Spirits &s;een by two Per&s;ons of our <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI>'s own Acquaintance. In the Year 1711, one Mrs. <HI>Stephens,</HI> and her Daughter, were together with Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Ramell</HI>'s, a very great and noted Weaver at <HI>Hagger&s;tone,</HI> where the rainy Weather detained them till late at Night. Ju&s;t after the Clock &s;truck Twelve, they all of them went to the Door to &s;ee if the Rain had cea&s;ed, being extremely de&s;irous to get home. As &s;oon as ever they had open'd the Door and were all got together, their appear'd before them a Thing all in White, the Face &s;eem'd of a di&s;mal pallid Hue, but the Eyes thereof fiery and flaming like Beacons, and of a &s;aweer Size. It made its Approaches to them, till it came up within the Space of about three Yards of them, there it fixt and &s;tood like a Figure agaze, for &s;ome Mi|nutes; and they all &s;tood likewi&s;e &s;tiff like the Figure, frozen with Fear, Motionle&s;s, and Speechle&s;s: When all of a &s;udden it vani&s;h'd from their Eyes; and that Apparition to the Sight was &s;ucceeded by a Noi&s;e, or the Ap|pearance of a Noi&s;e, like that, which is occa|&s;ioned by the Fighting of twenty ma&s;tiff Dogs.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="294">
Not long after, Mrs. <HI>Anne Stephens,</HI> who lived in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> a Woman well known by her great Dealings with Mercers upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill,</HI> &s;itting in her Hou&s;e alone, and mu&s;ing upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, happened by Ac|cident to look behind her, and &s;aw a dead Corps, to her thinking, lie extended upon the Floor, ju&s;t as a dead Corps &s;hould be, ex|cepting that the Foot of one Leg was fix'd on the Ground as it is in a Bed, when one lies with one Knee up; &s;he look'd at it a long while, and by degrees at la&s;t &s;tole her Eyes from &s;o unplea&s;ing and unexpected an Ob|ject. However a &s;trange kind of a Curio&s;i|ty overcame her Fears, and &s;he ventured a &s;econd Time to turn her Head that Way, and &s;aw it, as before, fix'd for a con&s;iderable time longer, but dur&s;t not &s;tir from her Seat; &s;he again withdrew her Eyes from the horri|ble and melancholy Spectacle, and re&s;um'd the Courage, after a little Reflection, of view|ing it again, and re&s;olving to a&s;certain her|&s;elf if the Vi&s;ion was real, by getting up from her Seat and going to it, but upon this third Retro&s;pection &s;he found it vani&s;h'd. This Relation &s;he writ down to Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> and has told before Mrs. <HI>Ramell,</HI> her own Si&s;ter, and many other very credita|ble Per&s;ons. Now as to the&s;e Arguments from Experience, I &s;hall al&s;o deliver my Opi|nion; I di&s;pute not but that learned Men, who have ob&s;tinate Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, may pro|duce
<PB N="269" REF="295">
plau&s;ible Arguments, why all Things &s;hould be thought to be done by Impo&s;ture which &s;eem &s;trange to them, and interfere with their Belief; and truly thus far their Humour may be indulged, that if only one Per&s;on relates a very &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing Story, a Man may be more apt to think it is <HI>po&s;&s;i|ble</HI> for that Per&s;on to <HI>lie,</HI> than that &s;o <HI>&s;trange</HI> a Relation &s;hould be <HI>true;</HI> but if a con&s;idera|ble Number of Per&s;ons of &s;everal Countries, &s;everal Religions, &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, &s;everal Ages, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons look'd upon to be of as great Sagacity as any the Country af|ford, agree in Relations of the &s;ame Kind, tho' very &s;trange, and are ready to vouch the Truth of them upon Oath after having well con&s;ider'd Circum&s;tances; I think it a Vio|lation of the Law of Nature to reject all the&s;e Relations as fabulous, merely upon a &s;elf-pre&s;uming Conceit, unle&s;s a Man can fair|ly &s;hew the Things to be impo&s;&s;ible, or can demon&s;trate wherein tho&s;e Per&s;ons were im|po&s;ed on; for from hence, I form the follow|ing conclu&s;ive Argument.

<P>THESE Objectors go on to &s;ay, that provided they &s;hould allow there is an Exi&s;tence of Spirits, yet that would be &s;till no Argument how <HI>Magick</HI> &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t, be|cau&s;e they deny that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Man in his Body to have a Commerce, much le&s;s make a Contract with Spirits; but here a|gain the <HI>Refuters</HI> alledge, they have both Experience and Rea&s;on on their Sides. As a joint Argument of Rea&s;on and Experience, they tell you, that the numerous Witches which have in all Countries been arraigned and condemned upon this Occa&s;ion, are evident Te&s;timonies of this Commerce, and Contract being held and made with Spirits. They pre|tend to &s;ay, that the&s;e Objectors call not their, the Refuters, Judgment &s;o much in Que&s;tion, who contend that there is a magick Art, as they call in Que&s;tion the Judgment of all the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lative Powers in Chri&s;tendom,

<P>But here the Objectors return and &s;ay, that it being impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;hew <HI>the man|ner how</HI> &s;uch a Contract &s;hould be made, we can never, but without Rea&s;on, believe a Thing to be, of which we can form no per|fect Idea. The Refuters, on the other hand, reply with the learned Father <HI>le Brune;</HI> it's manife&s;t, that we can &s;ee but two &s;orts of Beings; <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> and that &s;ince we can rea&s;on but according to our own Ideas, we <HI>ought</HI> to <HI>a&s;cribe</HI> to <HI>Spirits</HI> what <HI>cannot</HI> be produced by <HI>Bodies.</HI> Indeed, the Author of the Republick of Learning, in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t, Anno</HI> 1686, has given us a rough Draft for writing a good Tract of Witchcraft, which he looks upon as a <HI>De&s;ideratum.</HI> Where among other Things he writes thus; Since this Age is the true Time of Sy&s;tems, one &s;hould be contriv'd concerning the Commerce that may be betwixt Daemons and Men.</P>
<P>On this Pa&s;&s;age, Father <HI>le Brune</HI> writes thus. <Q REND="inline">"Doubtle&s;s here the Author complies with the Language of a great many Per&s;ons, who, for want of Attention and Light, would, have us put all Religion in Sy&s;tems.

We mu&s;t make a Sy&s;tem to explain the Ef|fects of the Load&s;tone, the Ebbing and Flow|ing of the Sea, the Motion of the Planets; for that the Cau&s;e of the&s;e Effects is not evi|dently &s;ignified to us, and many may be con|ceived by us; and to determine us, we have need of a great number of Ob&s;ervations, which, by an exact Induction, may lead us to a Cau&s;e that may &s;atisfie all the <HI>Phoenomena.</HI> It's not the &s;ame in the Truths of Religion, we come not at them by groping, it were to be wi&s;h'd Men &s;poke not of them, but after a deci&s;ive and infallible Authority.

It is true indeed, they are &s;ometimes permitted to have it over the Ju&s;t, tho' they have it not ordinarily, but over tho&s;e, that want Faith, or Fear, not to partake of their Works; and that to the la&s;t particu|larly, the <HI>di&s;order'd Intelligencies</HI> try to make exactly &s;ucceed what they wi&s;h; in&s;piring them to have Recour&s;e to certain Practi&s;es by which tho&s;e &s;educing Spirits enter into Com|merce with Men."</Q> Thus far Father <HI>le Brune.</HI> But &s;till the&s;e Objectors demand to know, by <HI>what Means</HI> this Commerce may be held be|tween Daemons and Men, and urge us to de|&s;cribe the <HI>Manner;</HI> or pretend that they have
<PB N="273" REF="299">
&s;till rea&s;on to refu&s;e coming into the Belief of a Thing, which we would impo&s;e upon them, tho' wholly ignorant of it our&s;elves: To that, the Refuters an&s;wer thus, That both Chri&s;tian Divines, and Phy&s;icians agree, (as to the manner how, which they are &s;o cu|rious in enquiring after,) that <HI>Daemons</HI> &s;tir up Raptures and Exta&s;ies in Men, binding or loo&s;ing the exterior Sen&s;es, and that either by &s;topping the Pores of the Brain, &s;o that the Spirits cannot pa&s;s forth, (as it's done natu|rally by Sleep) or by recalling the &s;en&s;itive Spirits, from the outward Sen&s;es to the in|ward Organs, which he there retains: So the Devil renders Women Witches extatical and Magicians, who, while they lie fa&s;t a&s;leep in one Place, think they have been in divers Pla|ces, and done many Things. This the learned Objectors &s;ay proceeds from no Daemon, but from the Di&s;ea&s;e call'd an Epilep&s;y; but, on the other hand, the more learned Refuters in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the&s;e Exta&s;ies are not epi|leptick Scizures: This, &s;ay they, appears from <HI>Bodin,</HI> in his <HI>Theatre of univer&s;al Nature,</HI> where he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That tho&s;e, that are wrapt by the Devil, feel neither Stripes nor Cut|tings, nor no Wre&s;ting of their Limbs, nor burning Tortures, nor the Application of a red hot Iron; nay, nor is the Beat of the Pul&s;e, nor the Motion of the Heart per|ceived in them; but afterwards, returning to them&s;elves, they feel mo&s;t bitter Pains

of the Wounds received, and tell of Things done at 600 Miles di&s;tance, and affirm them&s;elves to have &s;een them done."</Q> The ingenious Dr. <HI>Ader,</HI> makes an admirable phy|&s;ical Di&s;tinction between this kind of Exta|&s;ie, and a Syncope, or Stupor, cau&s;ed by narcotick Medicines. <HI>Sennertus,</HI> in his <HI>In|&s;titutio Medica,</HI> writes of the Daemoniacal Sopor of Witches, who think they are car|ry'd thro' the Air, dance, fea&s;t, and have Copulation with the Devil, and do other Things in their Sleep, and afterwards believe the &s;ame Things waking. Now, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Whe|ther they are really &s;o carry'd in the Air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or being in a profound Sleep, or only Dream they are &s;o carry'd and per&s;i&s;t in that Opini|on, after they are awake: The&s;e Facts or Dreams cannot be natural; for it cannot be, that there &s;hould be &s;o great an Agree|ment in Dreams, of Per&s;ons differing in Place, Temperament, Age, Sex, and Stu|dies, that in one Night, and at the &s;ame Hour, they &s;hould, in concert, dream of one and the &s;ame &s;uch Meeting, and &s;hould agree, as to the Place, Number, and Qua|lity of the Per&s;ons, and the like Circum|&s;tances; but &s;uch Dreams are &s;ugge&s;ted from a preternatural Cau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Devil to his Confederate, by the Di|vine Permi&s;&s;ion of an Almighty Power, where Puni&s;hments are to be permitted to be inflicted upon reprobate Sinners."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="301">
Whence al&s;o, to tho&s;e Witches &s;incerely converted, and refu&s;ing to be any more pre|&s;ent at tho&s;e diabolical Meetings, tho&s;e Dreams no longer happen, which is a Proof that they proceeded, not before, from a natural Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Here begins the great Point of the Di&s;pute as to that Branch of Magick, which we call Na|tural Magick. The Objectors may tell us, that they will freely own, that there may be an Exi&s;tence of Spirits, that there may be an Exi&s;tence of Witches, that by a divine Power Men may be influenced, &s;o far as to have a Communication with good Spirits, and that from thence, they may become &s;piritual divine Magicians: They will likewi&s;e, perhaps, as freely grant, that by the Intervention of a Daemon, Things preternatural may be brought about by Per&s;ons, who have &s;tudied the Daemoniacal Magick, but then what they principally in&s;i&s;t upon, is, that it mu&s;t be contradictory to all humane Rea&s;on, to ima|gine that there can be &s;uch a Thing as Na|tural Magicians; and thus far they may form their Argument. They &s;ay, that the Per&s;ons, who contend for the magick Art, own, that all that is brought about by Magick, is by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Help of a Spirit, and that con&s;equently, what is Effected by it, mu&s;t be preternatural: Now, they &s;ay, it is a Thing incon&s;i&s;tent by a Natural Power, to bring about a preternatural Effect; therefore, there
<PB N="276" REF="302">
can be no &s;uch Thing as Natural Magick, which has within it&s;elf the Efficacy of de|&s;troying tho&s;e Acts done by Magicians, in the Diabolical.</P>
<P>To this, the Refuters take leave to reply, that the Foundation, upon which the Argu|ment is built, is wrong grounded; they have admitted, that, in diabolical Art Magick, there may be a Commerce held between Men and Spirits, by which &s;everal preternatural Effects may be brought about; and the Rea&s;on they a&s;&s;ign for it there, is, becau&s;e there is a pre|ternatural Agent concerned therein, the Devil: But then, &s;ay they, in Natural Magick, you can pretend to no &s;uch Agent, and there|fore to no &s;uch preternatural Effect. This Argument contains within it two Falacies: Fir&s;t, as to the Commerce held between a Man and a Daemon, there is nothing pre|ternatural in getting the Acquaintance; the Will of the Man is entirely Natural, either naturally good, or naturally corrupted: The black Spirit that conver&s;eth with him, it is acknowledg'd is not &s;o, but it is from the Will of the Man; not from the Power ve&s;ted in the Devil, that the Acquaintance fir&s;t grows, therefore the Acquaintance it &s;elf is natural, tho' it ari&s;es from the la&s;t Corruption and De|pravations of Nature, but being made with a preternatural Exi&s;tence tho' the Cau&s;e of the Acquaintance be corruptedly Natural, yet the intermediate Cau&s;e or Means after that
<PB N="277" REF="303">
Acquaintance is not &s;o, and therefore the Ef|fect of that intermediate Cau&s;e may be wonderful, and &s;eem to be out of the ordi|nary Cour&s;e of Nature. Now, &s;ince it is ge|nerally allow'd, that there are Natural Spirits of the Elements as well as Divine and In|fernal, what we have to prove is only this; that Man by Natural Magick may have a Commerce with Natural Spirits of their Elements, as Witches may have with the Spirits or Daemons. Now, as we &s;aid before, the Commerce it&s;elf depends upon the Will of the Per&s;on, and is therefore Natural, and con&s;equently may as well &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the one as the other; for the Devil cannot force a Man to hold a Commerce with him whe|ther he will or no. The &s;econd Falacy is calling the Effect preternatural, no other|wi&s;e than as it connotates the Agent that brought it about, which is a &s;piritual Agent; for the Effect is (in it&s;elf con&s;ider'd) Natural, and brought about by &s;econd Cau&s;es that are Na|tural, by the Devil's Penetration, who is &s;ub|tile enough to make u&s;e of them for &s;uch and &s;uch Ends. Now Men by Natural Spi|rits, which are of a Faculty thoroughly &s;ub|tle, may as well with natural &s;econd Cau&s;es compa&s;s the Remedy of an evil Spirit, as the Devil is able to infect Men with it. From the&s;e Speculations a farther plain Con&s;equence may be deduced, how a Man may, by the pure Force of Natural Magick, cure a Per&s;on that
<PB N="278" REF="304">
is infe&s;ted with Evils by a Daemon; for how is it that a Daemon infe&s;ts any Body with his evil Motions? It's true, he is a preternatural Agent, but the evil Effect he does, is brought about by Natural Cau&s;es. For how does a Daemon &s;tir up Raptures or Exta&s;ies in Men? why he does it (as we are told above) by bind|ing or loo&s;ing the exterior Sen&s;es, by &s;top|ping the Pores of the Brain, &s;o that the Spi|rits cannot pa&s;s forth: And this, the Art of Phy&s;ick can compa&s;s by its Drugs, and Sleep cau&s;es the &s;ame Thing very naturally of it&s;elf; therefore as the Evil it&s;elf is Natural, the Re|medy, that is Natural, will certainly over|come it: But then, &s;ay you, why can't tho&s;e Per&s;ons be cured by Phy&s;icians? I an&s;wer, not becau&s;e their Remedies are not in them|&s;elves &s;ufficient to cure the Evils them&s;elves, but becau&s;e generally Phy&s;icians don't ad|mini&s;ter their Drugs as Chri&s;tians, but as Phy|&s;icians; and when they pre&s;cribe them to the Sick, they generally pre&s;cribe to them only purely con&s;ider'd as Patients, not as Chri&s;tians, and therein they come to fail: Becau&s;e the Agent, the Devil, is a &s;ubtle Spirit that brings the Evil, and alters its Situation before the Remedy, which would ma&s;ter it otherwi&s;e, can take any Effect; which Agent, the Devil, is employ'd by the horrible and impious Faith of the Antiphy&s;ician, <HI>viz.</HI> the black Magi|cian: But, if the Phy&s;ician would act the Chri&s;|tian, at the &s;ame time, &s;o far as to have a
<PB N="279" REF="305">
Faith that Things ordain'd in the Cour&s;e of Nature, for the Good of Man, would have its Effects in &s;pite of a Devil, if taken with a good Faith by the Patient: That all good Things ordain'd to be for the natural Re|covery of Men, if they took it with Thank|fulne&s;s to the Sender, would have due Effect; why then the Natural Spirits of the Elements would re&s;i&s;t the farther Agency of the Dae|moniacal Spirit, and then nothing but the Natural Evil (cau&s;ed at fir&s;t by the Daemon) remaining in the Per&s;on without the farther Superintendency of the Daemon, might de|mon&s;tratively be taken away by the mere na|tural Remedy or Medicine. And thus good and pious Phy&s;icians making u&s;e of &s;uch pro|per Remedies as their Skill teaches them, and having an hone&s;t Faith, that the Goods of Nature intended for the U&s;e and Benefit of Man, if received by the Patient with the &s;ame good Faith, is above the Power of the Devil to fru&s;trate, may not improperly be called Natu|ral Magicians. The&s;e Arguments of mine, I &s;hall now take Leave to back by Experience.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what we have urged from Rea|&s;on, concerning the Power of Natural Ma|gick, we &s;hall only &s;ubjoin, that Divines them&s;elves hold that Natural Magick, and al&s;o Natural Divinations, and Prophecies, are proved by Quotations from that venerable Writ which is their Guide; and bring Proofs from the &s;ame al&s;o, that by Natural Magick
<PB N="280" REF="306">
Daemons are al&s;o ca&s;t forth, but not all kinds of Daemons, and &s;o many Works of Effica|cy are wrought by Natural Magick: They tell you, &s;uch was the <HI>Pythoni&s;&s;a</HI> that rai&s;ed the Apparition to <HI>Saul,</HI> which appeared in a Body of Wind and Air. Thus, if a Per|&s;on by Natural Magick &s;hould ca&s;t out Dae|mons, it does not follow, that this was al&s;o from Divine Magick; and if Daemons are ca&s;t out by Natural Magick, by one that is in the Fear of God, it does not follow that he is a true Magician of God, but if it ex|orbitates to Daemoniacal, then it is condemned; and when Natural Magick keeps within its Bounds, the Divines tell us, it is not con|demn'd in the venerable Book which is the Chri&s;tian's &s;ure Guide. But, ina&s;much as the Law|fulne&s;s even of Natural Magick has been called in Que&s;tion by others, I &s;hall, in an <HI>Appendix</HI> join'd to this Treati&s;e, examine that Matter both according to the Rea&s;ons of our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Laws, and according to the be&s;t &s;tated Rules of Ca&s;ui&s;try that I am a Ma&s;ter of; &s;till &s;ubmitting my Judgment to the &s;uperior Judgment of tho&s;e who are profe&s;s'd Di|vines and Lawyers: And if my Opinions prove erroneous, I am willing to retract them; and therefore, in this place, there remains nothing farther for me to do, but only, as I have &s;hewn, on the one hand, how Natural Ma|gick, and its powerful Operations are prov'd by Rea&s;on; to &s;hew, on the other hand, how

And to do this, after having mentioned one memorable In&s;tance, which I refer the Reader to in the Body of the Book, concerning the Performances of Mr. <HI>Greatrix,</HI> to which a Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> was a Witne&s;s in <HI>Ireland;</HI> I &s;hall, to avoid Pro|lixity, bring the other Te&s;timonials of Prac|tice, from the Succe&s;s which our <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> him&s;elf has had in this Way on other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the Year 1713, lived in <HI>Fanchurch-&s;treet,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Coates,</HI> a Tobacco-Merchant, who had been for many Years &s;orely tormented in his Bo|dy, and had had Recour&s;e for a Cure to all the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians of the Age, even up to the great Dr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> him&s;elf; but all this mighty Application for Relief was &s;till in vain: Each Doctor own'd him a Wonder and a My&s;tery to Phy&s;ick, and left him as much a Wonder as they found him. Nei|ther could the Profe&s;&s;ors of Surgery gue&s;s at his Ailment, or re&s;olve the Riddle of his Di&s;|temper; and after having &s;pent, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, above a thou&s;and Pounds in &s;earch of proper Remedies, they found the Search ineffectual: The learned all agreed, that it could proceed from nothing el&s;e but Witchcraft; they had now indeed gue&s;s'd the Source of his Illne&s;s, but it was an Ill|ne&s;s of &s;uch a Kind, that, when they had
<PB N="282" REF="308">
found it out, they thought them&s;elves not the proper Per&s;ons to pre&s;cribe to him any Remedies. That Task was re&s;erv'd, it &s;eems, for our <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> who, upon &s;ome Body's Information or other, was &s;ent for to the betwiched Patient Mr. <HI>Coates,</HI> who found him the Wonder, that the others had left him, but did Wonders in undertaking and compa&s;&s;ing his Cure. I remember, one of the Ingredients made u&s;e of, was boiling his own Water, but I can't tell how 'twas u&s;ed; and, upon turning over the Books of &s;ome great Phy&s;icians &s;ince, I have found, that they them&s;elves have formerly deliver'd that, as one part of the Pre&s;criptions for the Cure of Patients in like Ca&s;es. But as there are other Things, which Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> performs, that &s;eem to require a Mixture of the Second|&s;ight, and of this Natural Magick before they can be brought about, I will entertain the Reader with one or two Pa&s;&s;ages of that &s;ort likewi&s;e, and &s;o conclude the Hi&s;tory of this &s;o &s;ingular a Man's Life and Adventures.</P>
<P>In the Year 1710, a Gentlewoman lo&s;t about &s;ix Pounds Worth of <HI>Flanders-lace,</HI> and ina&s;much as it was a Pre&s;ent made to her Husband, &s;he was concerned as much as if it had been of twenty Times the Value; and a Lady of her Acquaintance com|ing to vi&s;it her, to whom &s;he unfolded a|mong other Things in di&s;cour&s;e this little Di&s;|a&s;ter: The Lady &s;miling, reply'd, with this
<PB N="383" REF="309">
Que&s;tion, did you never hear, Madam, of Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell?</HI> It is but making your Ap|plication to him, Things that are lo&s;t, are im|mediately found; the Power of his Know|ledge, exceeds even the Power of Laws; they but re&s;train, and frighten, and puni&s;h Robbers, but he makes Thieves expiate their Guilt, by the more virtuous Way of turning Re&s;torers of the Goods they have &s;toln. Madam, re|join'd the lo&s;ing Gentlewoman, you &s;mile, when you tell me this, but really, as much a Triflc as it is, &s;ince 'twas a Pre&s;ent to my Husband, I can't help being &s;en&s;ibly concern|ed at it, a Moment's Di&s;appointment to him in the lea&s;t Thing in Nature, creates in me a greater Unea&s;ine&s;s, than the greate&s;t Di&s;ap|pointment to my &s;ingle &s;elf could do, in Things of Moment and Importance. What makes me &s;mile, &s;aid the Lady, when I &s;peak of it, or think of it, is the Oddne&s;s and Pe|culiarity of this Man's Talent in helping one to &s;uch Things, but, without the lea&s;t Je&s;t, I a&s;|&s;ure you, that I know, by Experience, the&s;e Things come within the Compa&s;s of his Know|ledge; and I mu&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly tell you, for your farther Satisfaction, that he has help'd me, and &s;everal of my Friends, to the finding a|gain Things lo&s;t, which were of great Value. And is this, without laughing, true, &s;aid the lo|&s;ing Fair, very gravely, and demurely, like a Per|&s;on half believing, and de&s;irous to be fully confirmed in &s;uch a Belief? The Lady, &s;he
<PB N="284" REF="310">
advis'd with, did then a&s;certain her of the Truth of the Matter, alledging that, for a &s;ingle half Guinea, he would inform her of her Things, and de&s;cribe the Per&s;on that convey'd them a|way. No &s;ooner was this Gentlewoman con|vinc'd, but &s;he was eager for the Tryal, &s;o|licited her Friend to conduct her to Mr. <HI>Campbell;</HI> and upon the fir&s;t Word of Con|&s;ent, &s;he was hooded and &s;carf'd immediate|ly, and they coach'd it away in a Trice to Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Hou&s;e, whom they luckily found within.</P>
<P>The Ladies had not been long &s;eated, be|fore he wrote down the Name of this new Client of his, exactly as it was, <HI>viz.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Saxon.</HI> Then &s;he was in good Hopes, and with much Confidence, propounded to him the Que&s;tion about the Lace. He pau&s;ed but a very little while upon the Matter, before he de&s;crib'd the Per&s;on that took it, and &s;atisfy'd her, that in two or three Days &s;he would be Mi&s;tri&s;s of her Lace again, and find it in &s;ome Book, or Corner of her Room. She pre&s;ented him a Half-guinea, and was very contentedly go|ing away; but Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> very kindly &s;top'd her, and &s;ignify'd to her, that, if &s;he had no more to offer to him, he had &s;omething of more Importance to reveal to her: She &s;ate full of Expectation while he wrote this new Matter; and the Paper he deliver'd to her contain'd the following Account. As for the Lo&s;s of a little bit of Lace, it is a
<PB N="285" REF="311">
mere Trifle; you have lo&s;t a great many hundreds of Pounds, which your Aunt (nam|ing her Name) left you, but you are bubbled out of that large Sum. For while you was artfully required down Stairs about &s;ome pretended Bu&s;ine&s;s or other, one Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">tt<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n,</HI> convey'd your Aunt's Will out of the Desk, and &s;everal other Things of Value, and wri|ting down the Names of all the Per&s;ons con|cern'd, which put Mrs. <HI>Saxon</HI> in a great Con|&s;ternation: He concluded this Paper, with bid|ding her go home with a contented Mind, &s;he &s;hould find her Lace in a few Days, and as &s;he found that Prediction prove true, &s;he &s;hould afterwards come and con&s;ult about the the Re&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he came home (it &s;eems) big at fir&s;t with the Thoughts of what &s;he had been told, &s;he rifled and ran&s;ack'd every Corner, but no Lace was to be met with; all the next Day, &s;he hunted in the like manner, but frighten'd the whole Time, as if &s;he thought the Devil was the only Per&s;on could bring it, but all to no Purpo&s;e; the third Day her Curio&s;ity abated, &s;he gave over the Hopes of it, and took the Prediction as a vain Delu&s;ion, and that, what &s;he gave for it, was on|more Money thrown away after what had been lo&s;t before. That very Day, as it com|monly happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, when &s;he lea&s;t dreamt of it, &s;he lighted on't by Acci|dent and Surprize. She ran with it in her
<PB N="286" REF="312">
Hand immediately to her Husband, and now &s;he had recover'd it again, told him of the Lo&s;s of it, and the whole Story of her ha|ving been at Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s about it; and then amplifying the Di&s;cour&s;e about what he had told her be&s;ides, as to more con&s;idera|ble Affairs, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he re&s;olv'd to go and con|&s;ult him a little farther about them, and begg'd her Husband to accompany her. He would fain have laugh'd her out of that Opinion and Intent, but the End was, &s;he per&s;uaded him into it, and prevailed upon him to &s;eem at lea&s;t very &s;erious about the Matter, and go with her to the Oracle, a&s;&s;uring him there was no room for doubting the &s;ame Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Well! to Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s they accordingly came, and after Mr. <HI>Saxon,</HI> in Deference to his Wife's De&s;ire, had paid our Predictor a hand&s;ome Complement of Gold; Mr. <HI>Dun|can Campbell</HI> &s;aluted him in as grateful a manner, with the A&s;&s;urance, that there was in <HI>Kent,</HI> a little Country Hou&s;e with &s;ome Lands appertaining to it, that was his in right of his Wife: That he had the Hou&s;e, as it were, before his Eyes, that tho' he had ne|ver &s;ub&s;tantially &s;een it, nor been near the Place where it &s;tood, he had &s;een it figura|tively as if in exact Painting and Sculpture, that particularly it had four green Trees be|fore the Door; from whence he was po&s;itive, that if Mr. <HI>Saxon</HI> went with him in que&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="313">
of it, he &s;hould find it out, and know it as well the Moment he come near it, as if he had been an Inhabitant in it all his Life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Saxon,</HI> tho' &s;omewhat of an Unbe|liever, yet, mu&s;t naturally wi&s;h to find it true, you may be &s;ure, and yet partly doubting the Event, and partly plea&s;ed with the vi&s;ionary Pro|mi&s;e of a Fortune henever expected, laugh'd very heartily at the Oddne&s;s of the Adventure, and &s;aid, he would con&s;ider, whether it would not &s;avour too much of <HI>Quixoti&s;m,</HI> to be at the Expence of a Journey on &s;uch Frolicks, and on &s;uch a chimerical Foundation of airy Hopes, and that then he would call again and let Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> know his Mind upon that Point.</P>
<P>In every Company he came into, it &s;erv'd for Laughter and Diver&s;ion; they all, how|ever, agreed 'twas worth his while, &s;ince the Journey would not be very expen&s;ive, to go it by way of Frolick. His Wife one Morning, &s;aying, that &s;he did remember &s;ome talk of a Hou&s;e, and &s;uch Things as Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had de&s;crib'd, put him forward upon the Adven|ture; and upon Mr. <HI>Saxon</HI>'s propo&s;ing it to his Brother <HI>Barnard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Barnard</HI> favour'd the Propo&s;al as a Joke, and agreed upon the Country Ramble. They came on Hor&s;eback to Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s, with a third Hor&s;e, on which the Dumb Predictor was mounted, and &s;o on they jogg'd into <HI>Kent</HI> towards <HI>Sevenoak,</HI> be|ing the Place which he de&s;crib'd. The fir&s;t Day they &s;et out, was on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning in <HI>June,</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="314">
and about Five that Afternoon they arrived at the <HI>Black-Bull</HI> at <HI>Sevenoak</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> It being a delicate Evening, they took an a|greeable Walk up a fine Hill gracefully adorn'd with Woods to an old Seat of the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>'s: Meeting, by the way, with an old Servant of the Earl's, one <HI>Perkins,</HI> he offer'd Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI> who (it &s;eems) was his old Ac|quaintance to give them all a Sight of that fine ancient Seat.</P>
<P>After they had plea&s;ed them&s;elves with viewing the antique Nobility of that &s;tately Structure, this <HI>Perkins</HI> went back with them to their Inn, the <HI>Bull</HI> at <HI>Sevenoak.</HI> They, that could talk, were very merry in Chat; and the Dumb Gentleman, who &s;aw them laugh, and wear all the Signs of Alacrity in their Countenances, was re&s;olv'd not to be behind with their Tongues, and by Dint of Pen, Ink, and Paper, that he made Signs &s;hould be brought in, was re&s;olv'd (if one might be &s;aid to <HI>crack</HI> without <HI>Noi&s;e</HI>) to crack his Je&s;t as well as the be&s;t of 'em; for it may be tru|ly &s;aid of him, that he &s;eldom comes into any even diverting Company, where he is not the mo&s;t diverting Man there, and the Head (tho' we can't call him the Mouth) of the chearful Society. After having ey'd this <HI>Per|kins</HI> a little, and being grown, by his Art, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, as familiar with the Man's Humour, as if he had known him as many Years as Mr. <HI>Barnard:</HI> Pray, Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="315">
quoth he in writing) how comes it, you that are &s;o &s;taunch and &s;o &s;tiff a Whig, &s;hould be &s;o acquainted, and &s;o particularly fami|liar, with &s;uch an old <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> and &s;o vio|lent a Jacobite, as I know that Mr. <HI>Per|kin</HI> (whom I never &s;aw nor had any Notice of in my Life) to be? And pray, reply'd Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI> what rea&s;on have you beyond a Pun to take him for a Jacobite? Mu&s;t he be &s;o, becau&s;e his Name is <HI>Perkin?</HI> I do a&s;|&s;ure you in this, you &s;hew your&s;elf but lit|tle of a Conjurer; if you can tell no more of Hou&s;es than you do of Men, we may give over our &s;earch after the Hou&s;e you &s;poke of (here the Reader mu&s;t under&s;tand they di&s;cour&s;ed on their Fingers, and wrote by Turns). Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> reply'd &s;eriou&s;ly, laying a Wager is no Argument in other Things, I own, but in this I know it is, becau&s;e I am &s;ure, af|ter we have laid the Wager, he will fairly confe&s;s it among Friends, &s;ince it will go no farther, and I (&s;aid Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>) will lay what Wager you will apiece with you all round. Hereupon, Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI> who had known him a great many Years, was the fir&s;t that laid, and many more, to the Number of five or &s;ix follow'd his Example; the De|ci&s;ion of the Matter was deferr'd till next Day at the Return of the old Man to the Inn; they being about to break up that Night, and go to Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="316">
The next Day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Land|lord carry'd his Gue&s;ts to &s;ee the Country, and after a hand&s;ome Walk, they came thro' the Church-yard. They were poring upon the Tombs; no Delight can be greater to Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> than that; and really, by the fre|quent Walks he u&s;ually takes in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> and the Church-yards adjacent to this Metropolis, one would imagine he takes De|light to &s;talk along by him&s;elf on that dumb &s;ilent Ground, where the Characters of the Per&s;ons are only to be known, as his own Meaning is, by Writings and In&s;criptions on the Marble. When they had &s;ufficiently &s;urvey'd the Church-yard, it grew near Din|ner-time, and they went homewards; but before they had got many Yards out of the Church-yard, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> makes a full Stop, pointing up to a Hou&s;e, and &s;topping his Friends a little, he pulls out of his Pocket a Pencil and Paper, and notes down the fol|lowing Words; <HI>That, That is the Hou&s;e my Vi&s;ion pre&s;ented to me, I could &s;wear it to be the &s;ame, I know it to be the &s;ame, I am certain of it.</HI> The Gentlemen with him remark'd it, would not take any farther notice, at that Time, intending to inquire into it with Secrecy, and &s;o went on to the Inn to Dinner.</P>
<P>As merry as they had been the Night be|fore after Supper, they were &s;till more inno|cently chearful this Day after Dinner, till the
<PB N="291" REF="317">
Time of Service begun. When the Duty of the Day was perform'd and over, they re|turn'd to divert and unbend their Minds with plea&s;ant, but harmle&s;s Conver&s;ation. I &s;uppo&s;e no Body, but a Set of very great Formali&s;ts, will be offended with Scandal or Scruples, that to Travellers ju&s;t ready to de|part the Town; Mr. <HI>Perkin</HI> came on that good Day and decided the Wagers, by own|ing to all the Company (Secrecy being fir&s;t enjoined) that he was a 'Roman Catholick, tho' no Body of the Family knew it in &s;o many Years as he had lived there, which was before Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> was born. This, and other innocent Speeches, afforded as much Chearfulne&s;s as the Lord's Day would allow of.</P>
<P>On the next Day, being <HI>Monday,</HI> they &s;ent for one Mr. <HI>Toland Toler,</HI> an Attorney of the Place, to find out to whom that Hou&s;e belong'd, but by all the Inquiry that could po&s;&s;ibly be made with convenient Secrecy, no Body could find it out for a long time, but at la&s;t it came to light and appear'd to be ju&s;tly to a Tittle as Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> had predicted.</P>
<P>Being now &s;atisfy'd the next Day, our three Travellers return'd for <HI>London;</HI> and the two vocal Men were very jocular upon their Ad|venture, and by their outward Ge&s;ticulations gave the prophetical <HI>Mute</HI> his Share of Di|ver&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Barnard,</HI> as they pa&s;s'd into a Farmhou&s;e-yard, remark'd that all the Hogs
<PB N="292" REF="318">
fell a grunting and &s;queaking more and more; as Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> came nearer (who, poor Man! could know nothing of the Je&s;t, nor the Cau&s;e of it, till they alighted and told it him by Signs and Writing) &s;aid to Mr. <HI>Saxon</HI> laughing, now we have found out our Hou&s;e, we &s;hall have only Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> home again by him&s;elf, we have no farther Need of the Devil, that accompany'd him to the Country, up to Town with us, there are o|ther Devils enow to be met with there he knows, and &s;o this, according to the Fa&s;hion of his Predece&s;&s;or Devils, is enter'd into the Herd of Swine.</P>
<P>However, the Event of this Journey (to cut the Story &s;hort) procured Mr. <HI>Saxon</HI> a great In&s;ight, upon inquiry, into &s;everal Af|fairs belonging to him, of which he would otherwi&s;e have had no Knowledge; and he is now engaged in a Chancery Suit to do him|&s;elf Ju&s;tice, and in a fair way of recovering great Sums of Money, which, without the Con&s;ultation he had with this Dumb Gen|tleman, he had in all likelihood never dreamt of.</P>
<P>In the Year 1711, a Gentleman, who&s;e Name &s;hall be, in this Place, <HI>Amandus,</HI> famed for his exqui&s;ite Talents in all Arts and Sciences, but particularly for his Gentleman like and entertaining manner of Conver&s;ation, who&s;e Company was affected by all Men of Wit, who grew his Friends, and courted by all
<PB N="293" REF="319">
Ladies of an elegant Ta&s;te, who grew his Admirers: This accompli&s;h'd Gentle|man, I &s;ay, came to Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> in or|der to propound a Que&s;tion to him, which was &s;o very intricate, and &s;o difficult to an|&s;wer, that, if he did an&s;wer it, it might ad|mini&s;ter to him&s;elf, and the Ladies he brought with him, the Plea&s;ure of Admiration in &s;ee|ing a Thing &s;o wonderful in it&s;elf perform'd; or, on the other hand, if he did not make a &s;atisfactory Reply to it, then it might af|ford him and the Ladies a very great De|light, in being the fir&s;t that puzzled a Man, who had had the Reputation for &s;o many Years of being capable of baffling all the wittie&s;t Devices and &s;hrewd Stratagems that had been, from time to time, invented to baffle his Skill, and explode his Penetration in the Second-&s;ight, and the Arts which he pretended to. The Per&s;ons, whom <HI>Amandus</HI> brought with him, were the illu&s;trious La|dy <HI>Delphina,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd for her great Qua|lity, but &s;till more celebrated for her Beauty, his own Lady the admired <HI>Amabella,</HI> and a young blooming pretty Virgin whom we will call by the Name of <HI>Adeodata,</HI> about which la&s;t Lady the Que&s;tion was to be put to Mr. <HI>Campbell. Adeodata,</HI> it &s;eems, was the natural Daughter of this very fine Gentleman, who had never let her into the Knowledge of her own Birth, but had bred her up from her Infancy, under a borrow'd Name, in the
<PB N="294" REF="320">
Notion that &s;he was a Relation's Daughter, and recommended to his Care in her Infan|cy. Now the Man that had the Second|&s;ight, was to be try'd: It was now to be put to the Proof, if he could tell Names or no? <HI>Amandus</HI> was &s;o much an Unbeliever as to be willing to hazard the Di&s;covery&mdash;<HI>Amabella</HI> and <HI>Delphina</HI> were Strangers to her real Name, and ask'd <HI>Duncan Camp|bell,</HI> not doubting but he would &s;et down that which &s;he ordinarily went by: <HI>Ama|bella</HI> had indeed been told by <HI>Amandus,</HI> that <HI>Adeodata</HI> was the natural Daughter of a near Friend of his; but who this near Friend was remain'd a Secret: That was the Point which lay upon our <HI>Duncan Campbell</HI> to di&s;co|ver. When the Que&s;tion was propo&s;ed to him, what her Name was, he look'd at her very &s;tedfa&s;tly and &s;hook his Head, and after &s;ome Time, he wrote down, that it would be a very difficult Name for him to fix upon. And truly &s;o it prov'd; he toil'd for every Letter till he &s;weated; and the La|dies laugh'd incontinently, imagining that he was in an Agony of Shame and Confu|&s;ion at finding him&s;elf poz'd. He de&s;ired <HI>Amandus</HI> to withdraw a little, for that he could not &s;o well take a full and proper Sur|vey of Ladies Faces, when a Gentleman was by. This Di&s;turbance and Perplexity of his, af|forded them &s;till more &s;ubject of Mirth; and that Excu&s;e was taken as a Pretence, and
<PB N="295" REF="321">
a put-off to cover his Shame the better and hide from one at lea&s;t, that he was but a downright Bungler in what he pretended to be &s;o wonderful an Arti&s;t. However, after two Hours hard Sweat and Labour, and viewing the Face in different Shades and Lights, (for I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to the Reader that there is a va&s;t deal of Difference, &s;ome he can tell in a Minute or two with Ea&s;e, &s;ome not in le&s;s than four or five Hours, and that with great Trouble) he undeceived them with Regard to his Capacity. He wrote down, that <HI>Adeodata</HI>'s real Name was <HI>Aman|da,</HI> as being the natural Daughter of <HI>Aman|dus. Delphina</HI> and <HI>Amabella</HI> were &s;urpriz'd at the Di&s;covery; and <HI>Amandus,</HI> when he was call'd in, owning it a Truth, his Wife <HI>Amabella</HI> applauded the curious Way of her coming by &s;uch a Di&s;covery, when <HI>Adeo|data</HI> was ju&s;t marriageable, took a Liking to her as if her own Daughter; and every Thing ended with Profit, Mirth and Chearfulne&s;s. I could add a thou&s;and more Adventures of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Life, but that would prove te|dious; and as the Town has made a great De|mand for the Book, it was thought more pro|per to conclude it here. The mo&s;t diverting of all, are to be found be&s;t to the Life in original Letters that pa&s;s'd between Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI> and his Corre&s;pondents, &s;ome &s;elect ones of which will be &s;hortly publi&s;h'd in a little Pock|et-volume for the farther Entertainment of &s;uch

from the Opinions of &s;ome of the mo&s;t Learned in holy Science; I thought it not improper to add the following &s;hort <HI>Appendix,</HI> (being a Summary of &s;everal Acts of Parliament made again&s;t <HI>Fortune|tellers, Conjurers, Egyptians, Sorcerers, Pretenders to Prophe&s;y,</HI> &amp;c. with &s;ome proper Remarks, &s;uited to our pre&s;ent Pur|po&s;e) as well to &s;atisfie them who are fan|ta&s;tically Wi&s;e, and ob&s;tinately &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the mo&s;t refulgent Rea&s;on, and are wilfully deaf to the mo&s;t convincing and per&s;ua&s;ive Arguments, and thereupon cry out, that Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> is either an Im|po&s;tor and a Cheat, or at lea&s;t a Per&s;on who acts by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of unlawful Powers; as al&s;o to put to &s;ilence the no le&s;s wa&s;pi&s;h Curs, who are always &s;narling at &s;uch, whom Providence has di&s;tingui&s;h'd by more excellent Talents than their Neigh|bours. True Merit is always the Mark, a|gain&s;t which Traducers level their keene&s;t Darts; and Wit and Invention oftentimes join Hands with Ignorance and Malice to foil tho&s;e, who excel. Art has no greater Enemy than Ignorance; and were there no &s;uch thing as Vice, Virtue would not &s;hine with half its Lu&s;tre. Did Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> perform tho&s;e wonderful Things he is &s;o de&s;ervedly famous for, as the&s;e Cavillers &s;ay, by holding Intelligence with Infernal Powers, or by any unju&s;tifiable Means, I

am of Opinion he would find very few, in this athei&s;tical Age, who would open their Mouths again&s;t him, &s;ince none love to act Counter to the Intere&s;t of that Ma&s;ter they indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;erve. And did he, on the o|ther Hand, put the Cheat upon the World, as they maliciou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, I fancy he would then be more generally admired, e&s;pecially in a Country where the Game is &s;o univer|&s;ally, artfully, and no le&s;s profitably play'd, and that with Applau&s;e, &s;ince tho&s;e Preten|ders to Wi&s;dom merrily divide the whole Species of Mankind into the two Cla&s;&s;es of Knaves and Fools, fixing the Appellation of Folly only upon tho&s;e, whom they think not Wi&s;e, that is, wicked enough to have a Share with them in the profitable Guilt.</P>
<P>Our Laws are as well intended by their wi&s;e Makers to skreen the Innocent, as to puni&s;h the Guilty; and where their Penal|ties are remarkably &s;evere, the Guilt they puni&s;h is of a proportionable &s;ize. Art, which is a Man's Property, when acquir'd, claims a Protection from tho&s;e very Laws which fal&s;e Pretenders thereto are to be try'd and puni&s;hed by, or el&s;e all Science would &s;oon have an end; for no Man would dare make u&s;e of any Talent Providence had lent him, and his own indu&s;trious Applica|tion had improved, &s;hould he be immedi|ately try'd and condemn'd by tho&s;e Statutes,
<PB N="300" REF="326">
which are made to &s;uppre&s;s Villains, by every conceited and half learned Pedant.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed tho&s;e excellent Statutes, which are made again&s;t a &s;ort of People, who pretend to Fortune-telling, and the like, are &s;uch as are well warranted, as being built upon the be&s;t Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> Reli|gion and Policy: and were Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> guilty of any &s;uch Practice, as tho&s;e are made to puni&s;h, I openly declare, that I &s;hould be &s;o far from endeavouring to de|fend his Cau&s;e, that I would be one of the fir&s;t that &s;hould aggravate his Crime, there|by to enforce the &s;peedier Execution of tho&s;e Laws upon him, which are made a|gain&s;t &s;uch Offenders. But when he is &s;o far from acting, that he doth not even pre|tend to any &s;uch Practice, or for counte|nancing the &s;ame in others, as is manife&s;t from the many Detections he has made of that &s;ort of Villany, which the Book fur|ni&s;hes us with, I think my &s;elf &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified for thus pleading in his Defence.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice, in Reading the Statutes made again&s;t &s;uch Offenders, our wi&s;e Legi&s;lature hath not in any part of them &s;eem'd &s;o much as to imply, that there are in reality any &s;uch wicked Per&s;ons as they are made again&s;t, to wit, <HI>Conjurers,</HI> &amp;c. but that they are only Pretenders to tho&s;e infernal Arts, as may rea&s;onably be
<PB N="301" REF="327">
inferr'd from the Nature of the Penalties they inflict; for our fir&s;t Laws of that &s;ort only inflicted a Penalty, which affected the Goods and Liberty of the Guilty, and not their Lives, tho' indeed they were afterwards forced to heighten the Puni&s;hment with a Halter; not that they were better convinc'd, as I humbly conceive, but becau&s;e the Crimi|nals were mo&s;t commonly Per&s;ons who had no Goods to forfeit, and to whom their Li|berty was no otherwi&s;e valuable, but as it gave them the opportunity of doing Mi&s;chief. In|deed our Law-Books do furni&s;h us with ma|ny In&s;tances of Per&s;ons, who have been try'd and executed for Witchcraft and Sorcery, but then the wi&s;er part of Mankind have taken the Liberty to condemn the Magi&s;trate, at that time of Day, of too much Incon&s;ideration, and the Juries of an equal &s;hare of Credulity: And tho&s;e who have &s;uffer'd for &s;uch Crimes, have been commonly Per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t Rank, who&s;e Poverty might occa&s;ion a Di&s;|like of them in their Fellow-Creatures, and their too artle&s;s Defence &s;ubject them to their mi&s;taken Ju&s;tice; &s;o that upon the whole, I take the Liberty to conclude, and, I hope, not without good Grounds, that tho&s;e Laws were made to deter Men from an idle Pretence to my&s;terious and unju&s;tifi|able Arts, which, if too clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, commonly lead them into the darke&s;t Villa|ny, not only that of deceiving others, but
<PB N="302" REF="328">
as far as in them lye, making them&s;elves Slaves to the Devil: And not to prevent and hinder Men from u&s;eful Enquiries, and from the Practice of &s;uch Arts, which tho' they are in them&s;elves my&s;terious, yet are, and may be lawful.</P>
<P>I would not however be thought, in con|tradiction to my former Arguments, to a&s;|&s;ert, that there never were, or that there now are, no Per&s;ons &s;uch as Wizards, Sorcerers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for by &s;o doing, I &s;hould be as liable to be cen&s;ur'd for my Incredulity, as tho&s;e who defame Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> on that Account, are for their want of Rea&s;on and common Ho|ne&s;ty. Holy and prophane Writ, I confe&s;s, furni&s;hes us with many In&s;tances of &s;uch Per|&s;ons; but we mu&s;t not from thence ha&s;tily infer, that all tho&s;e Men are &s;uch who are &s;pightfully branded with the odious Guilt; for were it in the Devil's Power to make every wicked Man a Wizard, and Woman a Witch, he &s;oon would have Agents enough to &s;hake this lower World to Atoms; but the Almighty, who re&s;trains him, likewi&s;e re&s;trains tho&s;e.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much, I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider &s;ome of the Acts of Par|liament them&s;elves; the Per&s;ons again&s;t whom they were made, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of making the &s;ame. And &s;ome of the fir&s;t Acts we meet with, were tho&s;e which were made again&s;t a &s;ort of People called <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="329">
Per&s;ons, who, if in reality &s;uch, might, if any, be &s;u&s;pected of practi&s;ing what we call the <HI>Black Art,</HI> the &s;ame having been for many Ages encouraged in their Country; nay, &s;o much has it been by them favour'd, that it was introduced into their &s;uper&s;titi|ous Religion (if I may without an Ab&s;urdi|ty call it &s;o) and made an e&s;&s;ential Part thereof: And, I believe, <HI>Mahometi&s;m</HI> has not much mended the Matter, &s;ince it has imperio&s;ly reigned there, or in any re&s;pect reform'd that idolatrous Nation. Now the Mi&s;chief the&s;e Per&s;ons might do (being &s;o much in the Devil's Power) among the un|wary, was thought too con&s;iderable not to be provided again&s;t; and therefore our wi&s;e Legi&s;lature, the more effectually to prevent the &s;ame, by &s;triking at the very Founda|tion, made an Act in the 22 <HI>H.</HI> VIII. 8. That if any, calling them&s;elves <HI>Egyptians,</HI> do come into this Realm, they &s;hall forfeit all their Goods; and being demanded, &s;hall depart the Realm within fifteen Days, upon pain of Impri&s;onment: and the Importers of them, by another Act, were made liable to a heavy Penalty. This Act was continu'd by the 1 <HI>P.</HI> and <HI>M. Conjuration, Witchcraft, Inchantment,</HI> and <HI>Sorcery,</HI> to get Money, or con&s;ume any Per&s;on in his Body, Members, or Goods, or to provoke any Per&s;on to un|lawful Love, was by the 33 <HI>H.</HI> VIII. 14. and the 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 16. and the 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. 12. made
<PB N="304" REF="330">
Felony; and by the &s;ame 33 <HI>H.</HI> VIII. 14. it was made Felony to declare to another any <HI>fal&s;e Prophe&s;ies</HI> upon Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but this Act was repealed by the 1 <HI>Ed.</HI> VI. 12. but by another Act of the 3 and 4 of <HI>Ed.</HI> VI. 15. it was again enacted, that all &s;uch Per|&s;ons who &s;hould pretend to <HI>Prophe&s;ies,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hould, upon Conviction, for the fir&s;t Offence forfeit Ten Pounds, and one Year's Impri|&s;onment; and for the &s;econd Offence, all his Goods and Impri&s;onment for Life. And by the 7 <HI>Ed.</HI> VI. 11. the &s;ame was made to continue but 'till the then next Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament. And by the 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 15. the &s;ame Act was again renewed again&s;t <HI>fanta&s;|tical Prophe&s;iers,</HI> &amp;c. but both tho&s;e Acts were repealed by the 1 <HI>Jac.</HI> I. 12.</P>
<P>Thus far we find, that for Rea&s;ons of State, and for the Puni&s;hment of particular Per&s;ons, tho&s;e Acts were made and repealed, as oc|ca&s;ion required, and not kept on foot, or in|deed were they ever made u&s;e of, as I can remember in my reading, again&s;t any Per|&s;ons who&s;e Studies led them into a u&s;eful Enquiry into the Nature of Things, or a lawful Search into the Workings of Na|ture it&s;elf, by which means many Things are foretold long before they come to pa&s;s, as Eclip&s;es, and the like, which A&s;trologers &s;ucce&s;sfully do, who&s;e Art has been in all Ages held in &s;o great E&s;teem, that the fir&s;t Mo|narchs of the Ea&s;t made it their peculiar

Study, by which means they de&s;ervedly ac|quired to them&s;elves the Name of <HI>Magi</HI> or Wi&s;e Men; but, on the contrary, were pro|vided again&s;t Per&s;ons profligate and loo&s;e, who, under a Pretence and Mask of Science, commit vile and rogui&s;h Cheats; and this will the more plainly appear, if we con&s;ider the Letter and expre&s;s Meaning of the follow|ing Acts, wherein the Per&s;ons I am &s;peaking of, are de&s;cribed by &s;uch Characters which &s;uf|ficiently prove the A&s;&s;ertion: For in the 39 of <HI>Eliz.</HI> 4. it was enacted, That all Per&s;ons calling them&s;elves Scholars going about beg|ging, &s;ea-faring Men, pretending Lo&s;&s;es of their Ships and Goods at Sea, and going about the Country begging, or u&s;ing any &s;ubtile Craft, feigning them&s;elves to have Knowledge in <HI>Phi|&s;iognomy, Palmi&s;try,</HI> or any other the like crafty Science, or pretending that they can tell <HI>De&s;tinies, Fortunes,</HI> or &s;uch like <HI>fanta&s;tical Imaginations,</HI> &s;hall be taken and deem'd <HI>Rogues, Vagabonds, &s;turdy Beggars,</HI> and &s;hall be &s;tripp'd naked from the Middle upwards, and whip'd till his or her Body be bloody. And by the 1 <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 12. for the better re&s;training of the &s;aid Offences, and for the farther pu|ni&s;hing the &s;ame, it was farther enacted, That any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons u&s;ing <HI>Witchcraft, Sorce|ry,</HI> &amp;c. and all their Aiders, Abettors, and Coun&s;ellors, being convicted, and attainted of the &s;ame Offences, &s;hall &s;uffer Pain of Death, as Felons without the Benefit of Cler|gy:

<P>That the&s;e Laws were made again&s;t a Set of Villains, who&s;e natural Antipathy to Ho|ne&s;ty and Labour, furni&s;h'd them with Pre|ten&s;ions to an uncommon Skill, thereby the more ea&s;ily to gull and cheat the &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly credulous, and by that means di&s;cover from them &s;ome &s;uch Secrets that might far|ther them in perpetrating the more con&s;um|mate Villany, is plain from the very Words and Expre&s;&s;ions of the very Acts them&s;elves, and the De&s;cription of the Per&s;ons they are made again&s;t; and not, as I before ob&s;erved, to prevent and hinder Men from the lawful In|quiry after u&s;eful, delightful, and profitable Knowledge.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> who has been long a &s;ettled and reputable Inhabitant in many eminent
<PB N="307" REF="333">
Parts of the City of <HI>London,</HI> cannot, I am &s;ure, be look'd upon as one of tho&s;e the&s;e Acts of Parliament were made again&s;t, un|le&s;s we fir&s;t &s;trip the Acts them&s;elves of their own natural, expre&s;s and plain Meaning, and cloath them with that which is more ob&s;cure, unnatural, forced, and con&s;train'd a Practice, which, if allowed, would make them wound the Innocent and clear the Guilty, and ren|der them not our Defence but our greate&s;t Evil; they would, by that means, become a perfect <HI>Aenigma,</HI> and be &s;o far from being ad|mired for their Plainne&s;s, that they would be even exploded like the Oracles of the Heathen for their double Meaning.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> has the Second-Sight, as is unque&s;tionable from the allowed Maxim, that what has been may be again, and by that means can take a View of Contingencies, and future Events; &s;o long as he confines the&s;e Notices of approaching Occurrences to a good Purpo&s;e, and makes u&s;e of them only inno|cently and charitably to warn Per&s;ons from doing &s;uch Things, that according to his Con|ceptions would lead them into Misfortune, or el&s;e in putting them upon &s;uch Arts that may be of U&s;e and Benefit to them&s;elves and Po&s;terity, always having a &s;trict Regard to Morality and Religion to which he truly ad|heres: Certainly, I think, he ought &s;o much the more to be admired for the &s;ame, by how much the more this his excellent Knowledge
<PB N="308" REF="334">
is &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of other Men, and not be therefore unju&s;tly upbraided with the injuri|ous Character of a Cheat, or an ill Man: however this I will pre&s;ume to affirm, and I doubt not but to have my Opinion confirm'd by the learned Sages of the Law, that this his innocent Practice, and I venture to add hone&s;t one too, doth by no means intitle him to the Penalties of the before-mentioned Laws made again&s;t Fortune tellers, and &s;uch &s;ort of profli|gate Wretches; which it is as great an Ab&s;ur|dity to decry, as it would be to call him, who is a &s;ettled and reputable Inhabitant, a Stroller, or wandring Beggar.</P>
<P>Again, It is true, that Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> has re|lieved many that have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been Bewitched, as is related and well atte&s;ted in the Book of his Life; but will any one from thence argue that he him&s;elf is a real Conjurer or Wizard, becau&s;e he breaks the Chains by which tho&s;e unhappy Wretches were bound? No &s;urely, for if that were the Ca&s;e, we might then as well indict the Phy&s;ician who drives away a malignant Di&s;temper, and roots out its latent Cau&s;e by his my&s;terious Skill in Plants and Drugs; or conclude that the Judge who condemns a Criminal is for the &s;ame Rea&s;on guilty of the &s;elf-&s;ame Crime for which the Offender is &s;o by him condemned. Per&s;ons who delight in &s;uch unnatural Con|clu&s;ions, mu&s;t certainly be in Love with the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdities, and mu&s;t intirely aban|don
<PB N="309" REF="335">
their natural Rea&s;on, before they can be brought to conclude that the Prince of Dark|ne&s;s would a&s;&s;i&s;t Men in de&s;troying his own Power.</P>
<P>The be&s;t An&s;wer I can afford tho&s;e Men is Silence; for if they will not argue upon the Principles of Rea&s;on, or be guided by her Dic|tates, I think them no more fit to be contend|ed with in a rational and decent manner than Bedlamites, and &s;uch who are bereft of all Un|der&s;tanding. A Rod is the be&s;t Argument for the back of a Fool, and Contempt the be&s;t U&s;age that ought to be &s;hewn to every head|&s;trong and ignorant Opponent.</P>
<P>In a word, I know of no Branch of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Practice that bears the lea&s;t Re&s;em|blance to tho&s;e Crimes mentioned in the fore|going Acts. That he can and doth tell Peoples Names at fir&s;t Sight, tho' perfect Strangers to him, is confe&s;&s;ed by all who have made the curious Enquiry at his Hands; but what part of the Acts, I would fain know, is that again&s;t? Knowledge, and a clear Sight into things not common, is not only an allowable, but a com|mendable Qualification; and whether this Knowledge in him be inherent, accidental, or the re&s;ult of a long Study, the Ca&s;e is &s;till the &s;ame; &s;ince we are a&s;&s;ured he doth it by no unlawful Intelligence, or makes u&s;e of the &s;ame to any ill purpo&s;e, and therefore is undoubted|ly as lawful as to draw natural Conclu&s;ions from right Premi&s;&s;es. Hard is the Fate of any
<PB N="310" REF="336">
Man to be ignorant, but much harder would his Lot be, if he were to be puni&s;hed for being Wi&s;e, and, like Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> excelling others in this kind of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid in Defence of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and the Art he profe&s;&s;eth, but as the Arguments which are brought again&s;t him by his Enemies on the one hand, are trivial and ill-grounded, I therefore think they de|&s;erve no farther Refutation; &s;o on the other, his Innocency is too clear to require it.</P>
<P>After having thus taken a Survey of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Acts, with regard to their Legality according to the Statutes and the Laws of the Nation wherein he lives, we will con&s;ider next, whether according to the &s;tated Rules of Ca&s;ui&s;try, among the great Divines eminent for their Authority, it may be lawful for Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> to predict, or for good Chri|&s;tian Per&s;ons to vi&s;it his Hou&s;e, and con&s;ult him about his Predictions. I have upon this Head examin'd all the learnede&s;t Ca&s;ui&s;ts I could meet with in ancient Times, for I cannot meet (in my reading) with any Mo|derns that treat thoroughly upon this Ca&s;e, or I &s;hould rather have cho&s;en them, becau&s;e perhaps the Seond-Sight was le&s;s known in tho&s;e antient Days than it has been &s;ince, and &s;o might e&s;cape their Notice.</P>

The&s;e Divines have generally written up|on impious Arts of Magick, which they call by the Name of Divination; and this Divina|tion (as they term it) they divide into two Kinds, the <HI>One,</HI> in which the Devil is <HI>ex|pre&s;ly</HI> invoked to teach hidden and occult things; the <HI>Other,</HI> in which he is <HI>tacitly</HI> cal|led upon to do the &s;ame. An <HI>expre&s;s</HI> In|vocation is by Word or Deed, by which a real Pact is actually made with the Devil, and that is a Sin that affects the Death of the Soul, according to the Laws of Theology, and ought to effect the Death of the Body, according to Civil and Political Laws. The <HI>tacit</HI> Invo|cation of Daemons is then only, when a Man bu&s;ies him&s;elf &s;o far with &s;uch Per&s;ons, that it is meet and ju&s;t that the Devil &s;hould be permitted to have to do with him, though it was oppo&s;ite to the Intention of the Man.</P>
<P>But then this <HI>expre&s;s</HI> Invocation again is &s;ub|divided into &s;everal Species, according to the diver&s;e manners by which the Devil in&s;tructs the&s;e Men.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is <HI>Enchantment,</HI> which I need not de&s;cribe, and of which I will &s;peak no more, becau&s;e it is what every Body knows to be de|te&s;table, and no Body ought to know the Art thereof.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Divination</HI> by Dreams, when any In&s;tructions are expected from the Devil by way of Dream, which is a capital Crime.</P>

The third is called <HI>Necromancy,</HI> which is, when by the u&s;e of Blood and Writing, or Speaking certain Ver&s;es the Dead &s;eem to ri&s;e again, and &s;peak and teach future things. For tho' the Devil can't recal a Soul departed, yet he can (as &s;ome have thought) take the Shape of the dead Corp&s;e, him&s;elf actuate it by his Subtilty, as if it was inform'd with a Soul. And &s;ome affirm, that by the Divine Permi&s;&s;ion, the Devil can do this, and &s;pake &s;o in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Samuel</HI> and <HI>Saul.</HI> But Divines of a more &s;olid Genius attribute that Power only to the Deity, and &s;ay, with Rea&s;on, that it is beyond the Devil's Capacity. But it is certain this was a Divination done in dead Animals by the U&s;e of their Blood, and therefore the word is de|rived from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which &s;ignifics Dead, and <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which &s;ignifies Divination.</P>
<P>The fourth Species is called <HI>Divination</HI> by the <HI>Pythians,</HI> which was taken from <HI>Apollo,</HI> the fir&s;t Diviner, <HI>as Thomas Aquinas</HI> &s;ays in his <HI>Secund&acirc; &s;ecundae qu.</HI> 95. <HI>Artic.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>The fifth is called <HI>Geomancy,</HI> which is when the Devil teaches any thing by certain Signs appearing in the earthly Bodies, as in Wood, Iron, or poli&s;hd Stones, Berylls, or Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Sixth is named <HI>Hydromancy,</HI> as when a Daemon teaches any thing by Appearances in the Water.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh is &s;tiled <HI>Aeromancy;</HI> and 'tis when he informs People of &s;uch things by Fi|gures in the Air.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="340">
The eighth is entituled <HI>Pyromancy;</HI> that is, when it in&s;tructs People by Forms appear|ing in the Fire.</P>
<P>The ninth is termed <HI>Aru&s;picy;</HI> which is, when by Signs appearing in the Bowels of &s;a|crificed Animals the Daemon predicts at Altars.</P>
<P>Thus far, as to <HI>expre&s;s</HI> Divination, or Invo|cation of the Devil, which is dete&s;table, and the very con&s;ulting of Per&s;ons, that u&s;e &s;uch unlawful Means, is according to the Judgment of all Ca&s;ui&s;ts, the high Road to eternal Dam|nation.</P>
<P>Now as to <HI>tacit</HI> Divination or Invocation of the Devil, that is divided into two &s;ub|altern Kinds. The fir&s;t Kind is, when for the &s;ake of knowing hidden things, they make u&s;e of a vain and &s;uper&s;titious Di&s;po&s;ition exi&s;ting in things to judge from; which Di&s;|po&s;ition is not of a &s;ufficient Virtue to lead them to any real Judgment. The &s;econd Kind of <HI>tacit Divination</HI> is, when that Knowledge is &s;ought by the Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e things, which Men effect on purpo&s;e and of their own accord, in order to come by and acquire that Knowledge.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e kinds of <HI>tacit</HI> Divination are again &s;ubdivided into &s;everal Species, as are particularly mentioned by St. <HI>Thomas, Secun|d&acirc; Secundoe.</HI> Quae&s;t. 95. Artic. 3. <HI>Gregory de Valentine,</HI> Tomo 3. Di&s;put. 6. quae&s;t. 12. Puncto 2. <HI>Toletus</HI> in Summ&acirc;. Lib. 4. cap. 15. And <HI>Michael Medina</HI> Lib. 2. <HI>de rect&acirc; in</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="341">
<HI>Deumfide: po&s;t &s;anctum Augu&s;tinum.</HI> Lib. 2. <HI>de Doct. Chri&s;t.</HI> cap. 19. <HI>&amp; &s;equen.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Kinds of tacit Divination, contains under it the following &s;everal Species.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Species is called <HI>Genethliacal,</HI> which is when from the Movement or Situa|tion of the Stars, Mens Nativities are calcula|ted and enquired into &s;o far, as that from &s;uch a Search they pretend to deduce the Know|ledge of human Effects, and the contingent Events that are to attend them. This <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> and <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI> condemns; but I &s;hall with Humility and Submi&s;&s;ion to great|er Judgments enquire hereafter into their Rea|&s;ons, and give my Opinion why I think this no evil Art; but I &s;ubmit my Opinion, if, after it is given, it is thought erroneous.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Augury,</HI> when any thing is predicted from the chattering of Birds, or the voice of Animals, and this may be either law|ful, or unlawful. If it comes from natural In|&s;tinct (for Brutes having only a &s;en&s;itive Soul, have their Organs &s;ubject to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the greater Bodies in which they are contain|ed, and principally of all to the Cele&s;tial Bo|dies) his <HI>Augury</HI> is not ami&s;s. For if when Crows are remark'd to Kaw (as the Vulgar Phra&s;e is) more than ordinary, it is, judging ac|cording to the In&s;tinct of their Nature, if we ex|pect Rain, and we may rea&s;onably depend up|on it, we &s;hall be right if we foretel Rain to be at hand. But &s;ometimes the Devils actuate
<PB N="316" REF="342">
tho&s;e Brute Animals to excite vain Ideas in Men, contrary to what the In&s;tinct of their Nature compels them to. This is &s;uper&s;titious and unlawful, and forbid in holy Writ.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Aru&s;picy,</HI> when from the Flight of Birds or any other Motion of any Animals what&s;oever, Per&s;ons pretend to have an In|&s;ight and a penetrative Knowledge into oc|cult and hidden Matters.</P>
<P>The fourth con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Omens,</HI> when for Example a Man from any Words which others may have &s;poken on purpo&s;e or by accident, pretends to gather a way of looking into and knowing any thing of Futurity.</P>
<P>The fifth is <HI>Chiromancy,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in making a pretence to the Knowledge of future things by the Figures and the Lines of the Hands: And if it be by con&s;ulting the Shoul|der-bones of any Bea&s;t, it goes by the name of <HI>Spatulamancy.</HI></P>
<P>As the fir&s;t kind of Divination, by a <HI>tacit</HI> Invocation of the Devil, is divided into the five Species above mentioned; &s;o al&s;o is the &s;econd kind of <HI>tacit</HI> Divination or Invocation of the Devil, divided into two Species by St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquin, Secunda &s;ecundae, quae&s;tione nonage|&s;im&acirc; quint&acirc; articulo tertio,</HI> and too tedious to in&s;ert here.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e ways are by the&s;e Divines counted wicked, and I &s;et them down that People may avoid them. For how many Gyp|&s;ies and Pretenders to <HI>Chyromancy</HI> have we in
<PB N="317" REF="343">
<HI>London</HI> and in the Country? How many that are for <HI>Hydromancy,</HI> that pretend in Water to &s;hew Men mighty My&s;teries? And how ma|ny in <HI>Geomancy,</HI> with their Berylls and their Gla&s;&s;es, that, if they are not under the In&s;tiga|tion of the Devil, propagate the Scandal at lea&s;t by being Cheats, and who ought to be puni&s;h'd, to the utmo&s;t Severity, as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws enact? Mr. <HI>Campbell,</HI> who hates, con|temns, and abhors the&s;e ways, ought, methinks, to be encouraged by their being re&s;train'd; and People of curious Tempers, who always receive from him moral and good In&s;tructions, which make 'em happy in the Conduct of Life, &s;hould be animated in a publick Man|ner to con&s;ult him, in order to divert the curious Itch of their Humours from con&s;ult|ing &s;uch wicked Impo&s;tors, or diabolical Prac|ticers, as too frequently abound in this Na|tion, by rea&s;on of the inqui&s;itive Vulgar, who are more numerous in our Climate, than any I ever read of.</P>
<P>But now to argue the ca&s;e of Con&s;cience with Regard to his <HI>particular</HI> Practice by way of the Second-Sight, whether, <HI>in foro Con|&s;cientiae,</HI> it is lawful for him to follow it, or others to con&s;ult him? The Divines above|mentioned having never had any notice of that Faculty in all likelihood, or if they had never mentioning it, makes it a point more difficult for me to di&s;cu&s;s; but I think they have &s;tated &s;ome Ca&s;es, by the making of
<PB N="318" REF="344">
which my Premi&s;&s;es, I can deduce from all the learned Men I have above quoted a Conclu&s;ion in favour of our Mr. <HI>Duncan Campbell,</HI> and of tho&s;e who con&s;ult him; but my Opinion &s;hall be always corrected by tho&s;e who are wi&s;er than my &s;elf, and to whom I owe entire Submi&s;&s;ion. I take leave to fix the&s;e Premi&s;&s;es from them fir&s;t, and to form my Argument from them afterwards in the following manner.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is allowed by all the&s;e Divines, that a Knowledge which one may have of future Things within the Order of Nature, is, and may be lawful.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They imply, that where Ju&s;tice is not violated, it is lawful both to predict, and to con&s;ult.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Many of them, but particularly <HI>Au|reolus</HI> puts this Que&s;tion: Is it lawful to go to one that deals in the Black Art, to per|&s;uade them to cure any innocent Body, that ano|ther <HI>Necromancer</HI> or Dealer in the Black Art may have maliciou&s;ly afflicted, and torment|ed with Pains? And &s;ome of the&s;e Ca&s;ui&s;ts, particularly <HI>Aureolus,</HI> &s;ay, it is lawful on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion to go to &s;uch a Conjurer, becau&s;e the end is not Conjuration, but freeing a Per|&s;on from it.</P>
<P>But I take leave to di&s;&s;ent from the&s;e great Men, and think they are in a double Mi&s;take;
<PB N="319" REF="345">
fir&s;t in &s;tating the Que&s;tion, and then in ma|king &s;uch an An&s;wer, provided the Que&s;tion had been &s;tated right.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is founded upon this Suppo&s;i|tion (which is pa&s;t by as granted), <HI>viz.</HI> that one <HI>Necromancer</HI> could relea&s;e a Per&s;on bewitched by another, which is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; for it's again&s;t the Nature of the Devil to be made an In&s;trument to undo his own Works of Im|piety: But admitting and not granting this to be po&s;&s;ible, and the Que&s;tion to be right|ly &s;tated, why &s;till the&s;e Ca&s;ui&s;ts are out in their An&s;wer? It is lawful, reply they, be|cau&s;e the end of going to the Conjurers, is not Conjuration, but freeing a good Per&s;on from it: But the end is not the Point here to be con&s;ider'd, it is the Medium which is bad, that is to be con&s;ider'd. It is by Con|juration, (according to their Hypothe&s;is) the other Conjuration is to be di&s;&s;olved; and does not the common Rule, that a Man mu&s;t not do Evil that Good may come of it, for|bid this Practice? And to &s;peak my Opinion plainly in that ca&s;e, the Friend that &s;hould con&s;ult a Conjurer for that end, would be only &s;o kind to put his own Soul in danger of being guilty of Hell-torments, to relieve his afflicted Friend from &s;ome bodily Pains, which 'twould be a Virtue in him to &s;uffer with Patience and Re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Others almo&s;t all Divines indeed agree, that it is and may be lawful to go to a Conjurer
<PB N="320" REF="346">
that torments another, and give him Money not to afflict the Patient any longer; becau&s;e that's only feeing him to de&s;i&s;t from acting after his conjuring manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e Premi&s;&s;es thus &s;ettled, if we allow the <HI>Second-Sight</HI> to be in-born and in-bred, and natural and common to &s;ome Families, which is proved in the Book; and if all that Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> has predicted in that Second-&s;ighted way terminates with moral Advice, and the Profit of the Con&s;ulter, and without the Vio|lation of Ju&s;tice to others, as the Book &s;hews all throughout; if he can relieve from Witch|craft, as it &s;eems Oath is to be had he can, which no one that deals in Black Art can do, why then I need not draw the Conclu&s;ion, e|very Reader will do it naturally; they will a|vow all the &s;tricte&s;t Laws of Ca&s;ui&s;try and Mo|rality to be in favour of Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and his Con&s;ulters.</P>
