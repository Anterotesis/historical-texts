<HEAD>ARGUMENTS About the ALTERATION of <HI>TRIENNIAL ELECTIONS</HI> OF
PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER to a Friend in the Country.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t Letter expre&s;&s;es your great Concerns and Fears about the De&s;ign now on foot for the Alteration of the <HI>Act for the frequent Meeting and Calling of Parliaments</HI> in one Particular, that is, the Changing the <HI>Term</HI> for <HI>Elections</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> from <HI>three</HI> to <HI>more</HI> Years; and at the &s;ame time gives me an Account of the &s;everal <HI>Objections,</HI> which make the greate&s;t Noi&s;e around you upon that Subject. The &s;ame <HI>Fears,</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>Objections,</HI> I find to be very common, and very warmly pro|pagated in all Conver&s;ations here in Town.</P>
<P>For my &s;elf, I acknowledge that it is with <HI>me,</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Ca&s;e, as it is in many others of Impor|tance; the <HI>fir&s;t Surprize</HI> gave me the like <HI>Unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> to what you expre&s;s: But I am very well &s;atisfied, that the mo&s;t likely Way to cure that Unea&s;ine&s;s, is, to debate the Matter as Friends; and to exa|mine, Whether that <HI>Surprize</HI> be the Force of <HI>meer Prejudice,</HI> or of good Judgment. And for this, I am very &s;ure, I am in one Re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, well qualified, That as to my own private Advantage, or Intere&s;t, it is not of the lea&s;t Importance to me, Whether the <HI>Parliament</HI> may, with the Con&s;ent of the <HI>King,</HI> &s;it <HI>three</HI> Years, or <HI>&s;even</HI> Years, or <HI>twenty</HI> Years. I have no De&s;igns, nor Views; no <HI>Piques,</HI> nor <HI>Re&s;entments;</HI> to incline me one way or other: And therefore, if you will put your &s;elf into the &s;ame <HI>Po&s;ture</HI> of Mind, we will, if you plea&s;e, enter upon this Subject.</P>
<P>In all <HI>Debates</HI> of this Nature, there are <HI>Two</HI> prin|cipal Points, which will comprehend under them all other Particulars. The <HI>One</HI> is, Whether the Thing propo&s;ed be <HI>lawful,</HI> with regard to the Na|ture of our Con&s;titution? The <HI>Other</HI> is, Whether it be <HI>expedient,</HI> or <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> to the Good Ends which ought always to be in the View of tho&s;e who make Laws?</P>
<P>The <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of the Thing can't be denied by any Per&s;ons, tho' never &s;o great Enemies to the doing it. Nor do I find, among&s;t all the <HI>Topicks</HI> employed again&s;t it, that any thing of Moment is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t the Right or Authority of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Legi&s;lature</HI> to do it. It is no more <HI>a Funda|mental</HI> of our <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> That a <HI>New Parliament</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ummon'd every <HI>three Years,</HI> than at any other Interval. It is equally ju&s;t, as far as <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> are concern'd, for the <HI>King, Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> to &s;ix it for <HI>one</HI> Term, as for <HI>another:</HI> And if it were not out of their <HI>Right</HI> to make that <HI>Great Alteration,</HI> which fix'd it for <HI>three</HI> Years, it certainly cannot be out of their <HI>Right</HI> to make a much le&s;s <HI>Alteration,</HI> by fixing it once more to another Term.</P>
<P>As to the Sen&s;e and Mind of the Electors, the Truth of the Matter is this: They are &s;up|pos'd to have no other View in their Choice of Per&s;ons, than to &s;end &s;uch to Parliament as they think be&s;t qualified, by their E&s;tates, Wi&s;dom and Integrity, to do whatever is to be done in Par|liament, without regard to the Time of their Sit|ting there. And there is no other End in the ele|cting Repre&s;entatives, but that they, from Time to Time, may make, and alter Laws, in &s;uch man|ner as be&s;t to con&s;ult and promote the Good of the whole Community: The very Election is, and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to impower the Elected Per&s;ons, faithfully, and impartially, to do every Thing that is nece&s;&s;ary, or expedient, for the Pre|&s;ervation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Common In|tere&s;t, whether it falls in with the Humours or Opinions of the Electors, or not. This brings us to the only Point to be con&s;ider'd, when any <HI>Alteration</HI> of a former <HI>Changeable Law</HI> is propo&s;ed; and that is, Whether, (all Things con&s;ider'd,) it be <HI>Expedient</HI> and <HI>U&s;eful?</HI></P>
<P>And of this, as far as the Time pa&s;t is con|cern'd, <HI>Experience</HI> is the be&s;t Judge. When a
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<HI>Law</HI> hath been long tried, and the <HI>Con&s;equences</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of it in a Nation, have been many Years open and &s;en&s;ible, it requires but little Thought to judge, whether it be be&s;t to continue it in eve|ry Re&s;pect, as it is, or to model it anew. And now, if you plea&s;e, we will con&s;ider the <HI>Effect</HI> the <HI>Triennial Elections</HI> have had among&s;t our &s;elves at <HI>Home;</HI> and then it will be proper to think of the <HI>Effect</HI> they have had, and &s;till mu&s;t naturally have, <HI>Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Home,</HI> the lea&s;t Evil is, that the <HI>Tempers</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> of Men are put into a <HI>Fermen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and boil'd up into a <HI>Rage,</HI> which never is cooled, becau&s;e the Returns, at which this <HI>Rage</HI> is u&s;eful to &s;ome Per&s;ons or other, are &s;o <HI>quick,</HI> that it is not <HI>Poli|tick</HI> in &s;uch Men to <HI>let</HI> it cea&s;e; nor perhaps po&s;|&s;ible for them to <HI>make</HI> it cea&s;e, even if they were willing to do &s;o. <HI>Riots, Tumults, Mutual Abu&s;es, odious Nick-Names, Per&s;onal Affronts,</HI> are kept alive and warm, from <HI>Three</HI> Year to <HI>Three</HI> Year, by Men of De&s;ign and Dexterity in the Manage|ment of other Men's <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions;</HI> improved and heighten'd by &s;uch <HI>quick Returns:</HI> The&s;e are what we &s;ee and feel of the <HI>Effects</HI> of it upon the Tem|per of a Nation, that if ever it is ruined, can be ruined by nothing but its divided Affections and Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, there could not be contrived a Method more effectual to the Debauchery of the Subject's <HI>Morals,</HI> not only in <HI>one,</HI> but in <HI>all,</HI> Re|&s;pects, than <HI>this</HI> hath proved. <HI>Bribery,</HI> known and open, (without a Remedy) which &s;uppo&s;eth a Corruption of Mind, and naturally leads to an In&s;en&s;ibility to every thing Great and Honoura|ble; and by Degrees, to a perfect Di&s;regard to every thing Sacred and U&s;eful. A Scene of Be|&s;tial Intemperance encouraged and paid for in many Places, for fear <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> &s;hould cool, if it be not kept hot by &s;uch Methods.&mdash;And the Crimes that often accompany <HI>this,</HI> need not be mentioned. The lea&s;t is a General Di&s;po&s;ition in Men to leave the Thoughts of Diligence and In|du&s;try in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, for the more agreeable Entertainments of Idlene&s;s, and a luxurious Beg|gary.</P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e or argue that this <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Term</HI> will put a full Stop to this Corruption of <HI>Morals,</HI> either as to <HI>Bribery,</HI> or to the other In&s;tances named. But it is certain that the Re|turns being not &s;o quick, the Tempers of Men mu&s;t, in the Nature of Things, become much more ea&s;y to one another by Degrees; which is it&s;elf an Advantage greatly to be valued. It is certain, that the <HI>Scent</HI> of <HI>Bribery</HI> cannot be &s;o &s;trong, nor the Avowal of it &s;o con&s;tant, when there is &s;uch an Intermi&s;&s;ion. And, as for that never-cea&s;ing Current of <HI>Debauchery,</HI> requi&s;ite for &s;o frequent Elections, it mu&s;t be this way inter|rupted; and, in a good Degree, broken into. The Crimes often accompanying it mu&s;t dimini&s;h: And the <HI>Men,</HI> brought up to laborious Callings, mu&s;t exchange their <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> for Indu&s;try; and be|come much more u&s;eful to their Families and the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>I mention not the Ruin both of the E&s;tates and Morals of <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;o frequently <HI>Candidates</HI> at our Elections: They know be&s;t how well they can bear &s;uch Evils; and whether it tends to make them&s;elves better <HI>Patriots</HI> to their Country, or better Fathers to their own Families, that they are to make their Way by &s;o quick Returns of <HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>We have hitherto con&s;idered the ill Effect of the&s;e evil Con&s;equences at home, &s;uppo&s;ing them to terminate in the Concerns of <HI>Private</HI> Men. But this Suppo&s;ition is not to be continued. For you will &s;ee pre&s;ently, that all the&s;e Things have a vi&s;ible Influence upon the <HI>Publick.</HI> The General <HI>Topick</HI> among&s;t the Adver&s;aries of this <HI>Alteration,</HI> as well <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who <HI>hate,</HI> as tho&s;e who <HI>love, Liberty;</HI> truly &s;o called, is, the <HI>&s;eeming</HI> Advantage of this Part of the <HI>Act</HI> to that great and lovely Good. I call it <HI>&s;eeming;</HI> becau&s;e, as it never was de&s;igned at fir&s;t, by many of the mo&s;t zealous Promoters of it, for any thing but to <HI>cramp</HI> the Endeavours of a <HI>Good Prince,</HI> for the &s;ettling our <HI>Liberties:</HI> So it hath never had any better la&s;ting Effect that Way, than they de&s;ign'd it &s;hould have; but, as I think, vi&s;ibly tends, in its Con&s;equences, to the De&s;truction of our legal Liberties. The Rea&s;on is &s;hort and plain. Nothing in the World can make Men more &s;upinely negligent of the Publick Intere&s;t, or di&s;po&s;e them more to receive their Chains, than a State of <HI>Bribery, Corruption, Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI> And this is the con&s;tant State of mo&s;t of our <HI>Electors,</HI> meerly thro' the quick Returns, and the plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect of <HI>Electi|ons.</HI> The more la&s;ting and uninterrupted this <HI>State</HI> is, the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible are they of the <HI>Evils</HI> it inclines them to. They are by degrees brought to think the <HI>highe&s;t Bidder</HI> to have the be&s;t Right to their <HI>Votes.</HI> And will act in Time agreeably to that Thought, whether the <HI>Money</HI> be offer'd them from Abroad, or at Home. The little Interruption to their Vices and their Expectations, is the Thing which makes the Danger &s;o great: And this is owing to the frequent Returns of <HI>Elections,</HI> at &s;o &s;hort, certain, Periods of Time.</P>
<P>Nor doth this Argument touch the <HI>Electors</HI> only, but the <HI>Elected</HI> al&s;o, to a very great degree. For as long as Humane Nature is capable of <HI>Corruption;</HI> as long as there is a <HI>Probability,</HI> or even a <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> of any Part of Mankind being induced to &s;ell their Country and their Po&s;terity, for a pre&s;ent Advantage to them&s;elves; &s;o long it is evident to a Demon&s;tration, that <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who have, by &s;o frequent Returns of <HI>Chargeable Elections,</HI> exhau&s;ted their E&s;tate, and impoveri&s;hed their Families, will be much more likely to &s;eek, or to embrace Op|portunities of re-imbur&s;ing them&s;elves, and pre|venting their own immediate Ruin, at the Ex|pence of the publick <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Security;</HI> much more likely I &s;ay, to act this Part, than if the <HI>Term</HI> were made longer; and if by that Means they might hope to be at re&s;t from Expence for a much longer Time.</P>
<P>Add to this, that <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> which is, of all others, the mo&s;t &s;trong <HI>Principle</HI> in the Bulk of <HI>Men,</HI> never fails to actuate both the <HI>Candidates</HI> and the <HI>Electors.</HI> If ever our Ruin be effected, it is too probable <HI>this</HI> will be the great Engine of it. And let every one judge, whether any thing could be devi&s;ed more likely, either to rai&s;e, or actuate, or pre&s;erve that Spirit in its Keenne&s;s and Bitterne&s;s, than the <HI>Triennial</HI> Returns of <HI>Elections,</HI> and the Expectation of them: Or whe|ther any thing can give us any <HI>Re&s;pite</HI> from that Spirit, and its fatal Con&s;equences, but an <HI>Altera|tion</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Returns</HI> to a longer Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>There is another Con&s;ideration very well worth mentioning on this Subject, which is the Di&s;tri|bution of Ju&s;tice in the Countries: It is manife&s;t, that nothing hath diverted the Cour&s;e of it from its proper <HI>Current,</HI> &s;o much as the <HI>Party-Views</HI> of Men, kept up to &s;uch a Degree by the expected Returns of <HI>frequent Elections;</HI> and that nothing can recall it again, but &s;ome Re&s;t from tho&s;e Views which turn'd it a&s;ide. Men will not have
<PB N="3" REF="3">
the Temptation, and therefore not the Inclination, either to &s;u&s;pend Ju&s;tice, or to act contrary to it, in many of tho&s;e In&s;tances, in which now their con&s;tant Hopes or Fears, actuated by the <HI>Frequency</HI> of <HI>Elections,</HI> are too apt to draw them a&s;ide. Be|&s;ides that, when &s;ome Intermi&s;&s;ion is given to the Heats and Quarrels of Neighbours, the Occa&s;ions and Opportunities of Partiality or Inju&s;tice, mu&s;t, in good mea&s;ure, cea&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Effects</HI> which I have now gone over are but too certain, as they are the natural Product of the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, in a divided Nation; and they are <HI>Evils,</HI> which will be, by degrees, at lea&s;t very much abated by the pre&s;ent De&s;ign.</P>
<P>We have hitherto con&s;ider'd our <HI>Triennial Electi|ons,</HI> their Influence upon <HI>Us</HI> at <HI>Home.</HI> Now, let us con&s;ider what Effect They have had, and &s;till natu|rally have, <HI>Abroad.</HI> And here it mu&s;t be remembred, that We are a Nation, not &s;eparated in Intere&s;t (as We are in Situation) from the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> We have Enemies at Home, acting in Concert with Enemies Abroad: And <HI>Friends</HI> Abroad, with|out regard to who&s;e Intere&s;ts and Alliances, We mu&s;t &s;ooner or later, become a Sacrifice to tho&s;e Enemies. We have a <HI>Pretender</HI> to guard again&s;t; Many here are his profe&s;s'd Friends; and many more act either blindly or de&s;ignedly with Tho&s;e who are &s;o; bearing a &s;en&s;ible part in their In|tere&s;ts, and ever encouraging, or at lea&s;t, not di&s;|couraging, Them. That which keeps up the Views of tho&s;e Abroad, who think it their Con|cern, to make us the Scene of <HI>Civil War,</HI> if not a <HI>Province</HI> to them&s;elves, under that <HI>Pretender; That,</HI> I &s;ay, alone, which keeps up their Views, is, the knowing They have <HI>Friends</HI> here; and the finding that the&s;e Friends are never in de&s;pair, but always repre&s;enting their Cau&s;e, as promi&s;ing well. And that which keeps them in this Temper, is, the con&s;tant Expectation of <HI>New Elections,</HI> in which They hope for more, but are certain at lea&s;t, of <HI>this</HI> Advantage, that our Heats, and Hatreds, and De&s;ire of Revenge, are &s;till perpetuated and im|proved. This is con&s;tantly repre&s;ented abroad; and with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that They who wi&s;h Evil to our Happy E&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;eem really to believe it; and they who wi&s;h well to it, receive Impre&s;|&s;ion enough from it, to look upon Us with Diffi|dence, as a <HI>People,</HI> always fluctuating and uncer|tain. It was this great di&s;advantage, ari&s;ing from our Condition at home, that brought King <HI>William</HI> to make a <HI>Peace,</HI> even again&s;t his own good Judg|ment, and his own great Views; for which no|thing could be urged, but that di&s;tre&s;s, to which our wretched and unea&s;y State here, had reduced his Affairs. And no wonder now if after that great Unhappine&s;s, and what is &s;till more dreadful, after a late Fatal Experience, the be&s;t Friends we have <HI>A|broad,</HI> cannot be &s;o confident of us, as our Intere&s;t makes it requi&s;ite they &s;hould be. In a Word, Our <HI>Enemies</HI> both <HI>Abroad,</HI> and at <HI>Home,</HI> can't be reduc'd even one &s;tep towards a &s;tate of <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> in the Methods We are in at pre&s;ent: Nor our be&s;t Friends be throughly a&s;&s;ured of our &s;ecure E&s;tate: The <HI>Former</HI> mu&s;t look upon us &s;till, with a good degree of Contempt; and the <HI>Latter</HI> with a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s and Diffidence, till We have &s;ome re&s;ting Time, to Settle, not only the <HI>Tempers,</HI> but the Affairs, and the Intere&s;ts of this Nation: Which never will be done, as there is Rea&s;on to fear, as long as <HI>Parliaments</HI> continue limited to the pre&s;ent Term.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of another very material Point, which tho' ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to procure Us the Confidence of our Friends, and to com|mand Re&s;pect from our Enemies; yet &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible to be Effected without a greater &s;teddine&s;s of Coun&s;els, a more uninterrupted Application to publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a more Mature and Di&s;inte|re&s;ted Deliberation, than the Experience we have had of frequent <HI>Elections</HI> gives room to hope for: This is the Paying off the <HI>Debts</HI> of the <HI>Nation,</HI> which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e Eat out the very Vitals of the Publick, and expo&s;e Us to the greate&s;t Dan|ger from &s;uch foreign Powers, as are u&s;ing the mo&s;t violent Methods to be before hand with Us in this &s;ignal Advantage. To work out this inve|terate Evil, there appears but one Method, con&s;i|&s;tent with the Faith of Parliamentary Securities (which ought to be pre&s;erved inviolable) and at the &s;ame time, free from the Odium of impo&s;ing new Taxes on the Country, and in which con|&s;equently the Landed, and the Monied Intere&s;t, would be likely to join, without eithers thinking them&s;elves in the lea&s;t aggrieved. This is to Rai&s;e and Support the Publick Credit to &s;uch a Height, as may enable the Government to Borrow, at a <HI>lower</HI> Intere&s;t, what may Pay off &s;uch Debts as carry a <HI>greater;</HI> which was attempted la&s;t Year, but hindred by the Rebellion. Now Experience &s;hews, that publick Credit will be &s;ubject to per|petual Fluctuations and Inequalities, or even fall to an Ebb from whence it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to make it re-a&s;cend, while the Mea&s;ures of one three Years are liable to be Unravell'd and Rever&s;ed by the Three next &s;ucceeding, and tho&s;e again by the next; and whil&s;t under the Shelter of frequent Elections, &s;uch Tumults, Commotions and Di&s;or|ders, are Introduced, as, however oppo&s;ite in them&s;elves, con&s;pire in &s;haking the Foundation of all Government, keep Mens Minds in &s;u&s;pence, and make them look on every Thing as precari|ous, that is any ways involved with the Publick.</P>
<P>After many <HI>Enquiries,</HI> I can meet with but one <HI>Good Event,</HI> in favour of the <HI>Triennial Term</HI> for <HI>Elections,</HI> which a long Experience hath furni&s;h'd us with: And that is, that it is &s;uppos'd to have been the occa&s;ion of throwing out the De&s;tructive <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Commerce;</HI> &s;ome <HI>Gentlemen</HI> not daring to Vote for it out of fear, of their next <HI>Elections.</HI> But this you will &s;ee, cuts both ways. For, as <HI>Gentle|men</HI> may by accident, not do a <HI>Bad</HI> thing for fear of their <HI>Next Election;</HI> &s;o it is as plain, that they may, as often, not do the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary <HI>good</HI> thing, if it happens to be <HI>Unpopular,</HI> for the &s;ame fear. So that this holds at lea&s;t equally <HI>again&s;t</HI> that Bill, as <HI>for</HI> it. But then many, who knew tho&s;e Times, will deny the <HI>Fact,</HI> and affirm, that a multitude of <HI>little Piques,</HI> and <HI>great Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> concurr'd in that Affair; and that the <HI>Awe</HI> of <HI>Electors,</HI> happen'd at that time to have but little Share in it. Private Hi&s;tory would be u&s;eful to us upon this occa&s;ion. But <HI>this</HI> We all &s;aw in <HI>publick,</HI> that however that Fear might then be &s;uppos'd to work &s;o far, as to hinder tho&s;e few <HI>Gentlemen</HI> from openly e&s;pou&s;ing that <HI>fatal Bill;</HI> it did not work &s;o far, as to keep them immedi|ately from entering into an <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> and Voting for &s;uch <HI>Methods,</HI> as mu&s;t have been as <HI>Fatal,</HI> as that Bill it &s;elf, if Providence had not interpo&s;ed. What would it have avail'd us, that the <HI>Bill</HI> had not pa&s;s'd <HI>then,</HI> if the&s;e De&s;igns, at the &s;ame Time on Foot, had prevail'd? And what doth it avail to &s;ay, that the <HI>Triennial Term</HI> did Us that good, (&s;up|po&s;ing it &s;o,) when it is plain, it had not the Power to pre&s;erve that Good; and that the &s;ame Per&s;ons, who &s;eem'd to fear it, yet were induc'd to <HI>undo</HI> their own Work, and to enter into Mea|&s;ures, which mu&s;t have ended in the &s;ame Evils,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
and indeed, in Univer&s;al De&s;truction? It &s;igni|fies little, therefore, whether this was the great occa&s;ion of that <HI>lucky Incident</HI> or not; becau&s;e it is plain it had not power enough to hinder the Ill Effects of that <HI>Bill,</HI> in another Me|thod: Nor would have hindred them, had not &s;omething el&s;e intervened. But &s;uppo&s;ing it had; certainly <HI>that</HI> one particular, &s;o purely acciden|tal, cannot be &s;et again&s;t a <HI>Train</HI> of Con&s;tant, and too certain, Evil Con&s;equences, which we feel every Day we live. The&s;e <HI>Evil Con&s;equences,</HI> are &s;o many undeniable-Arguments for an <HI>Alteration</HI> of it; and weigh exceedingly and particularly at this Juncture, when all our Happine&s;s depends upon the <HI>Firm E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of our <HI>Excellent King,</HI> upon this Throne; when all our Enemies at Home and Abroad, vi&s;ibly place their Hopes in our Di&s;turbances, owing to nothing &s;o much as to the con&s;tant Expectation of <HI>Triennial Elections;</HI> when all our true Friends, both here and el&s;e|where, wait with Impatience to &s;ee our Securi|ty firmly and throughly E&s;tabli&s;hed: When the going on with proper Mea&s;ures, for &s;uch E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, has been unavoidably put off, by the Attention given to the Rebellion, and &s;o the longer Continuance of this Parliament is become particularly nece&s;&s;ary; And when We all may ob&s;erve, if We plea&s;e, that, tho' the <HI>Rebellion</HI> be in great Mea&s;ure quell'd, yet, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of it, is &s;o far from being lay'd a&s;leep, that it walks about &s;till, even at Noon-day, in defiance of all <HI>Authority;</HI> and with a &s;trubborne&s;s, never to be re|duced to a &s;ettled De&s;pair, without &s;ome &s;uch <HI>Me|thod,</HI> as is now talk'd of.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Particulars,</HI> I &s;ay, are &s;o many undeniable Arguments, for an <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Years</HI> fix'd in the <HI>Act,</HI> unle&s;s it &s;hall appear that the <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t doing it, are of more Weight and Importance. Tho&s;e which I have been able to hear of, together with &s;uch as you tell me are mo&s;t talk'd of in the Country, We will now ju&s;t run over.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t general Objection (and that which &s;eems in reality to lye at the Bottom of all the re&s;t) is, that this Step will be &s;o un|popular among the Electors, and rai&s;e &s;uch a Cla|mour all over the Nation, as mu&s;t for ever &s;ink the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e who have any Share in pro|moting it. To this I an&s;wer, that it will wholly depend on the Parliament it &s;elf, to render this proceeding Popular, or Unpopular, by the right or wrong U&s;e they &s;hall make of the Prolongation thereby accruing to them&s;elves. If their After-behaviour &s;hould be &s;uch, as to &s;hew they had no wi&s;er, nor more generous View in making this Alteration, than merely to &s;ave them&s;elves the hazard, trouble and expence of a New Election, they mu&s;t, no doubt, be content to reap the Re|wards of their Selfi&s;hne&s;s, by forfeiting all Title to the future good Will of their Electors. But if their Zeal and Indu&s;try for promoting the Ea&s;e and Safety of the Nation, &s;hall appear to ri&s;e in proportion to the Time allowed them for accom|pli&s;hing the great Work they have begun, the <HI>End</HI> will &s;ufficiently commend the <HI>Means;</HI> and the Ad|vantages ari&s;ing to the whole Kingdom from this Change, will ea&s;ily Reconcile it to all &s;uch, with whom a good Man ought ever to wi&s;h to Maintain the Character of Popularity. It will certainly be in the Power of tho&s;e who mo&s;t apprehend the Odi|um, and Unpopularity of this Action, to Secure it from all po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;-repre&s;entations, by making U&s;e of the Power it will bring with it, to ju&s;t and wi&s;e Purpo&s;es; to ea&s;e the Debts, to perfect the Tranquility, and to perpetuate the Peace of the Nation. Rai&s;ing Money by <HI>Taxes</HI> upon <HI>Land,</HI> Windows, Soap, or any thing el&s;e, is always <HI>Unpopular,</HI> and always rai&s;es <HI>Clamours,</HI> when it is fir&s;t re&s;olved upon. Every thing that hath been done for the Security of His pre&s;ent <HI>Maje&s;ty;</HI> the &s;u&s;pending the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> without which We mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed; the grant|ing Him a Power to Rai&s;e, and Hire, Forces for his own, and the Nation's Defence; the putting his <HI>Friends</HI> into any Po&s;&s;ibility of con&s;ulting his Safety and Honour; Every particular of this &s;ort hath been repre&s;ented all over the Nation, in &s;uch Colours, that it hath been highly <HI>unpopular,</HI> and been attended with great <HI>Clamours:</HI> But Nece&s;&s;ity and Ex|pedience are the things to be con&s;ider'd in all &s;uch Points. <HI>The&s;e</HI> will always make things <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to the true Friends of the Nation. But in order to be <HI>popular</HI> with the <HI>King's</HI> Enemies, the fir&s;t Step he mu&s;t take, mu&s;t be, to lay down his <HI>Crown;</HI> and if his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> be re&s;olved to be moved by <HI>Cla|mours,</HI> they mu&s;t re&s;ign their <HI>Po&s;ts,</HI> and yield up all Power to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to de&s;troy them. The only Con&s;ideration is, whether the Nation's Affairs require a thing to be done: When <HI>that</HI> is fix'd, <HI>Popular</HI> or <HI>Unpopular, Clamours</HI> or <HI>no Clamours,</HI> ought not to affect any farther, than about the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it. Every thing that touches particular Men's Pur&s;es, or retrenches from their Luxury, will generally be <HI>Unpopular</HI> with tho&s;e Men: But a little Time makes &s;uch things ea&s;y, when the <HI>Publick</HI> finds it's Advantage in it, and Men's Pa&s;&s;ions have had Time to cool.</P>
<P>Another thing which I find generally &s;hews it &s;elf, at fir&s;t hearing of the <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> is, an <HI>Unea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> as if <HI>this</HI> were <HI>Repealing the Act:</HI> When, in truth, I will venture to affirm, that it is &s;o far from <HI>that,</HI> that it is indeed Re&s;toring it to its be&s;t De&s;ign; and making it effectual to all that Good which was originally purpo&s;ed, and intended, by any of tho&s;e <HI>hone&s;t Patriots</HI> who joined in the fir&s;t framing of it. The De&s;igns were, that a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould not be <HI>without</HI> a <HI>Parliament;</HI> and that <HI>one</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>Parliament</HI> &s;hould have a <HI>Term</HI> fixed, beyond which it &s;hould not be in the Power of the <HI>Prince</HI> to continue it. And in both the&s;e re&s;pects the <HI>Act</HI> will be left as it was. All the Difference is, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> then in being, thought <HI>Three Years</HI> the proper Term. Experience hath a&s;&s;ured us of a Multitude of Evils proceeding from &s;o quick a <HI>Return</HI> of <HI>Elections.</HI> And therefore, in that part of the <HI>Act,</HI> and in <HI>that</HI> only, is the <HI>Alteration</HI> in|tended, in order to remedy or abate tho&s;e <HI>Evils,</HI> without bringing in greater.</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> Rea&s;on again&s;t it, is taken from a Su&s;|picion of &s;ome private and per&s;onal Views in the <HI>King's Mini&s;ters;</HI> as if the whole Aim were to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves, for &s;o much longer time, in their Power. But I ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame Per&s;ons who make this <HI>Objection,</HI> generally contradict it, by affirming that the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> have nothing to fear, and that this pre&s;ent De&s;ign is wholly <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary,</HI> becau&s;e a Court may be &s;ure of another <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> to their Mind. They mu&s;t think the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> very weak, not to &s;ee this, which is &s;o plain, that the Influence of a <HI>Court</HI> hath hardly ever fail'd in this Point, tho' at the &s;ame time, the Gentlemen who make this Objection, are apt to in&s;inuate the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome Mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e, which cannot be very agreeable to an hone&s;t and incorrupt Mini&s;try. However, in the Opinion of &s;uch as allow this, it cannot be having a View to <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> but a general View to the <HI>Nation</HI> at <HI>Home,</HI> and to the Intere&s;t and
<PB N="5" REF="5">
Glory of it <HI>Abroad,</HI> which engageth the Mini&s;ters in this De&s;ign. They who know the Nature of &s;uch Affairs, judge the contrary, that <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> as to their own private Intere&s;t, might more proba|bly find their Account in <HI>New Parliaments,</HI> than in <HI>One continued.</HI> Experience &s;hews, that the mo&s;t <HI>Courtly Parliaments</HI> have turn'd <HI>Uncourtly</HI> in their long &s;itting. And therefore, this De&s;ign can't be nece&s;&s;ary for any private &s;elf-intere&s;ted Views of their own, becau&s;e it is allowed, that &s;uch Ends, (if they have any,) might be &s;erv'd as well, at lea&s;t, in the former Method, as in this. They, who find a <HI>Bia&s;s</HI> in their Minds, again&s;t every thing pro|po&s;ed by a <HI>Court,</HI> let it be what it will, &s;hould con&s;ider, in this Ca&s;e, whether it be not probable that the pre&s;ent Views and De&s;igns are of a <HI>Publick Nature,</HI> rather than of a <HI>Private;</HI> and &s;hould act accordingly, without prejudice, or affection, as they think it requi&s;ite, or not, for the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>Nation;</HI> and for the more effectual de&s;troying all the Hopes of the Enemies of both.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t powerful <HI>Objection</HI> of all, is, that the <HI>Alteration</HI> now de&s;ign'd, may make it much more likely, that under a <HI>Bad Prince,</HI> &s;ometime or other, <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> brought in. For the pre|&s;ent, I am &s;ure, we have nothing to fear. We have now a <HI>King</HI> upon the <HI>Throne,</HI> who&s;e <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"></HI> is fa&s;hioned to <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice;</HI> and who&s;e great en|quiry upon all Occa&s;ions is, what our Con&s;ti|tution and what our Laws require of <HI>Him.</HI> We have a <HI>Prince,</HI> in View, to &s;ucceed Him, who&s;e <HI>Native Honour</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> guard Him again&s;t all &s;u&s;picion. But I grant, this may not always be our Happine&s;s, either in <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> or in <HI>Pro&s;pect.</HI> And therefore if this <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">eration</HI> could be proved, I &s;hould be moved another way, than I am at pre|&s;ent: There will be more
<HI>Time,</HI> I acknowledge, in any one particular <HI>Parliament,</HI> for <HI>Attempts</HI> to be made that way. But, as I think, not at all more likely to &s;ucceed. On the contrary, there is more likelihood, that <HI>Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> &s;hould by degrees, be|come even ready to part with a Con&s;titution, for which there mu&s;t be &s;uch Contention by <HI>Bribery,</HI> and all the <HI>Arts</HI> of Iniquity, every <HI>Three Years,</HI> than if it were otherwi&s;e. And then again, &s;uppo&s;ing a <HI>Parliament</HI> cho&s;en for <HI>Three Years</HI> only; a <HI>Prince</HI> re&s;olutely bent upon doing it in a <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">liamentary</HI> way, prepared with Trea&s;ures and Favours, might make &s;uch Attempts, before that <HI>Term</HI> be expired, that none could re&s;i&s;t, who would not as certainly go on farther in their Integrity. One may venture to affirm, that a <HI>Parliament</HI> which keeps its Integri|ty for <HI>Three Years,</HI> will di&s;courage the making any &s;uch Attempts for the remaining <HI>Four.</HI> And, to give an In&s;tance, if I remember right, the <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> which gave up the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> gave that Fatal &s;troke within the <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Three Years</HI>&punc; Whenever a <HI>Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> can be bad enough for &s;uch a De&s;ign, they will fir&s;t take care, at the time of Election, to &s;et up Per&s;ons capable of the &s;ame bad De&s;ign. And then, there is no difference be|tween <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Seven Years.</HI> Only, here remem|ber, what I have before ob&s;erv'd to you, that the quick Returns of <HI>Trienn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">al Elections.</HI> tend much more, to that <HI>Corruption, Bribery,</HI> Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of Manners, as well as <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> which pave the way to the lo&s;s of <HI>Liberty,</HI> than the <HI>longer Term,</HI> now propo&s;ed, can do. One might appeal to any who know the World, whether it be not more probable (as I have urged already,) that the <HI>Elected Gentlemen</HI> them&s;elves, impoveri&s;h'd by &s;o frequent Returns of their great <HI>Charges,</HI> will be inclined to li&s;ten to the Offer made them, with &s;o pernici|ous a View, than if the Returns were not &s;o fre|quent; and be&s;ides this, whether the Influence that way, from the powerful motive of <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> will not have va&s;tly more weight, when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> rou&s;ed and irritated, and &s;et on Fire, by &s;o quick <HI>Returns</HI> of <HI>Contention,</HI> than if it were otherwi&s;e. And, what is of great moment, in my opinion, &s;ince it is plain that every In&s;tance of wickedne&s;s, and di|vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, tending to de&s;truction, is &s;o heighten'd and infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">med by the quick <HI>Returns</HI> of <HI>Elections;</HI> there mu&s;t be much greater Encouragement to a <HI>Foreign Enemy,</HI> to interpo&s;e with his Money, to purcha&s;e our Ruine, in a <HI>Triennial Choice,</HI> than in a <HI>Septennial.</HI> E&s;pecially now, before we are well &s;ettled upon that Bottom which is the only Foundation of our Happine&s;s. It is well known how far the Neigh|bouring Powers intermeddle in the Elections of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and with how much &s;ucce&s;s they &s;end their Agents and Factors to them; and what an abu&s;e of Liberty this Corruption has in|troduced in tho&s;e Countries, all the World can te&s;tify: Nor can we think the Election of a Briti&s;h Parliament, &s;o very indifferent a thing to &s;ome neighbouring Powers, e&s;pecially, at certain Jun|ctures, that they &s;hould think One or Two Hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds mi&s;applied, in purcha&s;ing Votes to their Mind. And I can &s;ay, that this is no whim&s;ical Suppo&s;ition, becau&s;e I have my &s;elf &s;een an <HI>Intercepted Letter,</HI> written from hence in|to <HI>France,</HI> ju&s;t before the la&s;t <HI>Election,</HI> by a Friend to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who had taken the <HI>Oaths</HI> to King <HI>George,</HI> plainly hinting both that &s;uch a thing was then expected from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that he did not doubt the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of it. I think, this alone is enough to allarm any true Lover of his Country, in the pre&s;ent Situation of our Affairs, and of tho&s;e of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is one more <HI>Objection,</HI> I hear, is often urged, That <HI>We</HI> &s;hould have &s;everely blamed &s;uch a De|&s;ign in the late <HI>Admini&s;tration:</HI> Nay, that great Horror was expre&s;s'd, at the very &s;uppo&s;ition of the thing, at that time; I grant this, and that the Horror was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. But upon what was this founded? Not upon the unlawfulne&s;s of the thing it &s;elf; not upon the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it's ever being fit to be done; but upon a too well|grounded A&s;&s;urance, that they who were then in Power mu&s;t have meant it, whenever they did it, for the &s;ame end, to which their other Acts tended, and that was, the utter Ruine of the <HI>Grand-Alli|ance,</HI> and of all the Hopes of our be&s;t <HI>Friends</HI> Abroad, and the in&s;piring full Vigour into the Cau&s;e of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> This was the Ground of all ju&s;t dread upon that Head. Had it been &s;o, that they had de&s;ign'd it manife&s;tly for the firmer Security of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> here, and the greater &s;upport of the <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> abroad, no true <HI>Britain</HI> could have had ground of Complaint, but mu&s;t have acknowledg'd, if it tended, and was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;&s;ary to &s;o good ends, that it was not on|ly lawfull, but highly prai&s;e-worthy. An In|&s;tance parallel to it may quite take off the Edg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this <HI>Objection.</HI> What hone&s;t Mind would not have been filled with <HI>Unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> &s;up|po&s;ing <HI>They</HI> had then attmpted to &s;u&s;pend the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> by which they might have confined all Men of great Capacity and Influence, whom they knew to be aver&s;e to their Proceedings, in favour of <HI>France?</HI> But would this have been any Argument, why the Friends of King <HI>George</HI> &s;hould not have &s;ecured <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>the Nation</HI> by &s;uch a <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion,</HI> when made nece&s;&s;ary by the Trea&s;onable Practices of his avowed Enemies? Or becau&s;e we blame a thing,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
lawful in it &s;elf, when we &s;ee it de&s;ign'd for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; therefore, mu&s;t we be aver&s;e to a <HI>lawful</HI> thing, de&s;ign'd, and tending to our <HI>Pre&s;ervation?</HI> This is the whole &s;trength of that <HI>Objection,</HI> which yet, I believe, weighs with many, for want of con&s;idering it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>late Mini&s;ters,</HI> I verily believe they de|&s;ign'd no &s;uch thing. And my rea&s;on for believing &s;o, is, that they did not at all want it; nay, that it would have done them more Hurt than Good. Their De&s;igns were &s;uch as were to be manag'd &s;olely by Artifice. The great <HI>Engines</HI> they made u&s;e of for keeping up a Spirit, again&s;t all Truth and Right, were tho&s;e very <HI>Mobbs, Riots,</HI> and <HI>Tu|mults,</HI> which alone could keep a Multitude in &s;uch a Ferment, as to make them admire, and pre&s;s for their own Ruine. They thought it their Intere&s;t to govern by the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Crowd: And were very peculiarly dextrous in the Management of them. They were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the full Cry, and Noi&s;e of the Nation, and likely, in all probability, &s;o to continue: This was a much &s;urer Hold to <HI>Them,</HI> and to <HI>their</HI> De&s;igns, than the Continuance of One and the &s;ame <HI>Parliament:</HI> And therefore, they never attempted it. But certainly, as that &s;ame Spirit, which was then rai&s;ed for the Service of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> made it <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> for <HI>them;</HI> &s;o, it being &s;till alive, and full of evil Influences upon our Happine&s;s, this makes it highly prudent in <HI>Others,</HI> to do <HI>that</HI> in order to &s;uppre&s;s and extir|pate it, which <HI>They,</HI> in their Wi&s;dom, would not do, for fear of quieting what they expected Bene|fit from. <HI>Their</HI> &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ted in keeping up that vile Spirit to the Heighth. It is the &s;ecurity of the <HI>King</HI> and his Government, to have a &s;top put to it, and to remove every Opportunity that may give <HI>Fuel</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> to it, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution and Liberties of the Nation.</P>
<P>All the&s;e <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> put together, have, I con|fe&s;s, wholly taken off my <HI>Fir&s;t Surprize.</HI> And the &s;ame Con&s;iderations make me hope, that all true Friends to the <HI>King,</HI> and to the <HI>Publick Happine&s;s,</HI> (which now depends entirely upon the firm <HI>E&s;ta|bli&s;hment</HI> of the pre&s;ent Royal Family) will not let their <HI>General Su&s;picion,</HI> or their <HI>Particular Bia&s;s,</HI> have &s;uch Power over them, as to move them, to join with their own <HI>Enemies,</HI> in a <HI>Point,</HI> in which if they &s;hould, by any unfore&s;een Accident, have <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> I am confident, they would very heartily, as well as fruitle&s;ly <HI>repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> of their own Proceed|ings. When Per&s;ons who have always &s;hewn them&s;elves <HI>Enemies</HI> to Liberty, and Profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Principles</HI> of Slavery; who have ever ex|pre&s;s'd a Hatred of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and of every thing built upon it; and have ever been the Sup|ports of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t in the&s;e Nations: When &s;uch, I &s;ay, put on a Zeal for <HI>Li|berty,</HI> it is a Moral Demon&s;tration that it is all a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ck-Shew;</HI> and that they them&s;elves think quite otherwi&s;e of what they oppo&s;e, than they would &s;eem to think. If it were really their Opinion, that the <HI>Alteration</HI> now propo&s;ed, would either help the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> which they have e&s;pou&s;ed, or be any Prejudice to a <HI>Government</HI> which they hate, I am very confident, they would not enter into the <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> of it, with that <HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> which they now profe&s;s. But they fore&s;ee that their <HI>Hopes</HI> mu&s;t in Proportion abate, with tho&s;e <HI>Heats</HI> and <HI>Di&s;turbances</HI> which alone keep them alive; and for this Rea&s;on it is, that they now take into their Mouths the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">rds</HI> and <HI>Topicks</HI> which they have ever hitherto ridiculed and exploded; in order to keep off the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ng</HI> which they heartily hate, <HI>the Settle|ment of the pre&s;ent Government in Peace and Quiet at Home, and in Honour and Glory Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>And this is one very good Rea&s;on, why <HI>All,</HI> who truly wi&s;h well to that <HI>Settlement,</HI> &s;hould unite in the <HI>Alteration</HI> of that which is the <HI>Chief,</HI> if not the <HI>Only,</HI> thing left to keep up the Spirits and De&s;igns of its Enemies. But if, when it is in our Power, to put &s;ome Stop to our pre&s;ent <HI>Corruptions</HI> and <HI>Di|&s;tractions,</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Glory</HI> of our <HI>King,</HI> and the Happine&s;s of our Country, in a Method per|fectly confident with all our Rights and Liberties, we are guided by the In&s;inuations of tho&s;e who hate us, and refu&s;e to do it, we mu&s;t thank our &s;elves for all that follows. It will lie at our Door to an&s;wer for all the Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Neg|lect. From <HI>the&s;e,</HI> with whom we join in it, we have no Returns to expect, but Contempt, Re|proaches, and In&s;ults.</P>
<P>In fine, I can con&s;ider the <HI>Triennial Return</HI> of our <HI>Elections,</HI> no otherwi&s;e, than as what hath made us, and &s;till continues us, the mo&s;t Divided and mo&s;t Corrupted of <HI>Nations;</HI> what was at fir&s;t by many contrived, and &s;till in its own Nature tends to oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of the <HI>Be&s;t Kings,</HI> and to promote tho&s;e of the <HI>Wor&s;t;</HI> leading to an univer&s;al Debauchery of the Manners and Tempers of the <HI>Electors,</HI> as well as to make the <HI>Elected</HI> them&s;elves weary enough of &s;uch perpetual Conte&s;ts and Charge, to incline &s;ome Time or other to <HI>Thoughts</HI> which would not otherwi&s;e find Admittance; in|fluencing the <HI>People</HI> to think ea&s;ily of becoming a Prey to the <HI>Highe&s;t Bidder;</HI> keeping up the <HI>Spirits</HI> of our <HI>Common Enemies,</HI> and creating Diffidence and Unea&s;ine&s;s in our <HI>be&s;t Friends;</HI> introducing and in|crea&s;ing all Exce&s;&s;es of Violence and Mutual Re|venge; &s;erving a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>bad</HI> Purpo&s;es, which have a peculiar Malignity at this particular Jun|cture, without having <HI>one</HI> good Effect, fit to be named in Oppo&s;ition to them: And all this occa|&s;ioned by the <HI>Shortne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Interval</HI> allowed, ei|ther to put an End to &s;uch Evils, or to cultivate any thing that is Good. To cure all the&s;e entire|ly, nothing can perhaps be thought of, but what would introduce greater. To apply &s;omething that may put an <HI>End</HI> to <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them, and abate and dimini&s;h the re&s;t, is a Matter that de&s;erves the Regard of every good <HI>Briton.</HI> And, I believe, at this Time nothing at all effectual can be thought of, without an <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Triennial Elections.</HI> I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
